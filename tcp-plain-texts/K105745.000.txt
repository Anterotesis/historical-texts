 PRACTICAL RULES OF DIET In the various Constitutions  and  Diseases OF HUMAN BODIES  By  JOHN ARBUTHNOT  M D Fellow of the  College of Physicians  and of the  Royal Society  LONDON  Printed for J TONSON in the  Strand  MDCCXXXII  PRACTICAL RULES OF DIET In the various Constitutions  and  Diseases OF HUMAN BODIES  THE PREFACE  _THE former Part of this Treatise has been censur'd for two Faults first for being obscure secondly for not being so practical as it ought to be As to the First I answer That  Obscurity  may be taken in two Senses as Real or as Relative to the Understanding of the Reader if Obscurity is taken in the first Sense I will venture to affirm That it is unjustly blam'd upon that Account Perhaps it may not be all true but I am sure it is intelligible If Obscurity is taken in the second Sense  Euclid  's Elements may be said to be obscure I freely own that I had made too partial a Judgment of the Capacity of several of my Readers and yet it is true That many not bred up in the Profession of Physick understood the Whole many a great Part of it  and it was not possible to write it down to the Capacity of every Body  The second Fault of its not being sufficiently practical I have endeavour'd to repair by the Addition of this Second Part which I was oblig'd to write in haste when the Distress both of my Mind and Body besides Business render'd me very unfit for such an Undertaking All I can say for it is That tho' it be less accurate it may perhaps be more useful than the first it being much such a Work as an Almanack of publick Benefit but from which no body I believe ever propos'd any Reputation It is a Collection of the scattered Precepts of the First Part and other new Rules extended to the most common Diseases as well as Constitutions of Human Bodies I have still follow'd the Method of the learned and industrious  Boerhaave  who has certainly studied and taught this Part of the Profession more than any that ever were before him  I cannot think it trifling nor unnecessary to treat this Dietetick Part of Medicine by it self with some Accuracy for the following Reasons  First  Because the Parts of any Art or Science are often best understood when they are treated separately  Secondly  Because the Practitioners in Physick and Chirurgery are often frustrated in their Intentions by Errors in Diet committed  by their Patients a Misfortune that I my self have felt several times and as I suppose in common with others of the Profession  Thirdly  Because some practical Rules of this sort may be useful to such as are remote from good Advice and likewise to some coarse Practitioners which they are obliged to make use of By the Methods prescrib'd in this short Treatise which are almost within the Reach of every Body more Good and less Mischief will be done in acute Distempers than by Medicines improperly and unseasonably administred and great Cures may be effected in Chronical Distempers by a proper Regimen of the Diet I hope I have done with this Subject I was drawn in to write the First Part by Accident and to write the Second by some Defects in the First these are the cumbersome Perquisites of Authors

Alimentary Substances austere and astringent  _AUSTERE astringent vegetable Substances  are such as contain an acid essential Salt combin'd with Earth and very little Oil as  Several sorts of  Plumbs  and some sorts of  Pears  distinguishable by their rough styptick Taste  Quinces  which by their Quality are often useful to weak Stomachs and in stopping of Fluxes of Blood  Pomegranates  which contain a Juice styptick and extremely cooling  Barberries Medlars Cornelian Cherries  all beneficial in BloodyFluxes  Sorrel  useful in Spitting of Blood and Stinking Breath  Purslain  succulent subacid with a cooling nitrous Salt  Burnet  astringent with a gentle spicy Quality vulnerary  Tamarinds  cooling astringent yet laxative to the lower Belly  Capers  astringent and diuretick  All  Pickles  especially  Samphire  which is stimulating Such sort of Substances by their Acidity and astringent Quality offend some Stomachs  There are  Wines  of the same Quality known by their rough austere Taste as likewise all acidulated and chalybeat  Waters  Strong Waters  or  spirituous Liquors  contract and harden the solid Parts most of all  Alimentary Substances softening and relaxing  The Juices of most sorts of ripe Garden Fruits as  Cherries  are cooling and laxative to the Bowels their Kernels are good for the Gravel in the Kidneys  Strawberries  which by their fragrant Smell seem likewise to be cordial The Seeds which are obtain'd by shaking the ripe Fruit in Water are an excellent Remedy against the Stone The Juice of Strawberries and Limons in SpringWater is an excellent Drink in bilious Fevers  Oranges  those that are sweet are more relaxing than the bitter or  Seville  Oranges which nevertheless are not heating these are an excellent Remedy against the hot Scurvy  Citrons  and  Limons  their Juices more cooling than that of Oranges Sour Limons do not possess this relaxing Quality very much they being somewhat styptick  Apples  which are likewise pectoral cooling and lenitive they differ considerably as to the Kinds of them and their Qualities may be easily known by their Taste  Pears  have most of the same Qualities some Kinds by their high Flavour seem to be more cordial than Apples  Peaches  which are likewise cordial and pectoral  Sweet  Plumbs  those of the austere Kind are astringent  Mulberries  pectoral corrective of the bilious Alkali  Apricocks  unless mellow are rather somewhat styptick  Gooseberries  extremely ripe are lenient unripe they are sour and rather astringent  Currants  are good in Spitting of Blood extremely cooling and somewhat astringent The Jelly or Rob of Currants mix'd with Water is a most excellent Drink in bilious Fevers  Grapes  taken in moderate Quantities help the Appetite and Digestion in great Quantities they resolve the Bile too much and produce Fluxes dry'd they are pectoral  Figs  are great Subduers of Acrimony useful in Hoarseness and Coughs extremely emollient and by relaxing the Urinary Passages diuretick useful in bloody Urine it has been always believed that the immoderate use of them generates Lice  Plants of the low pomiferous Kind as  Melons Pompions Gourds Cucumbers  contain a cooling Juice with a nitrous Salt that of Melons and the  Ananas  is rich and cordial they are diuretick and there are Instances when eaten in great Quantities they have produced bloody Urine they ought to be taken fasting The Juice of Cucumbers is too cold for some Stomachs and ought not to be taken by such as have thin and poor Blood if the Stem upon which they grow be bruised the Pulp of the Fruit grows bitter and has the Effect of Coloquintids The Juice of an unripe Cucumber is purgative Cucumbers are useful in bloody Urine  All Fruits which contain a subacid essential Salt much Phlegm and a small Quantity of Oil have this lenient Quality as likewise the emollient PotHerbs as  Cole Cabbage Coleworts  which are soft and demulcent without any Acidity The Jelly or Juice of red Cabbage bak'd in an Oven and mix'd with Honey is an excellent Pectoral  Lettuce  which has a milky Juice with an anodyne or opiate Quality resolvent of the Bile proper for melancholy People diuretick and good in Stranguries especially when eat raw it is reckoned to increase Milk  Cichory  and  Dandelion  have some of the same Qualities with a small degree of Bitterness extremely agreeable to the Stomach and not heating The Juice of the Dandelion is a Remedy in intermitting Fevers  Spinage  emollient but not very nourishing it is reckoned good in Inflammations of the Bowels  Beets  emollient nutritive and relaxing  Carrots  good in nephritical Cases antiacid and fattening  Parsnips  useful in phlegmatick Colicks the Plant from which Apoponox is taken is a sort of Parsnip  Skirrets  useful in bloody Urine and Spitting of Blood  Scorzonera  demulcent in the SmallPox Meazles and pestilential Fevers and for Gouty People the express'd Juice better than the Decoction  Goatsbeard  an alimentary Root has most of the Qualities of Scorzonera  Emollient likewise are all farinaceous or mealy Substances  Barley  which is deterging tho viscous in a small degree the Decoction and Cream of Barley are proper in inflammatory Distempers  Rice  nourishing good in Haemorrages or Fluxes of Blood  Mays  is not so easily brought to Fermentation as other Grains therefore more viscous  Wheat  the properest of any Grain for Bread which when not entirely purged from the Bran is laxative and stimulating to the Bowels  Rice  the Bread more acescent and less nourishing than that of Wheat  Oats  cleansing resolving and pectoral Oatmeal and Butter outwardly apply'd dry the Scab on the Head  Millet  diuretick cleansing and good in Diseases of the Kidneys  Panick  aperient boil'd with Milk demulcent temperating Acrimony  Pease  contain a soft Oil without any spicy Quality therefore are extremely demulcent and temper Acrimony  Beans  and  KidneyBeans  have the same Qualities they are reckoned diuretick and good for the Stone  It has been commonly reckoned because of the Viscosity of Pease and Beans that People who live a sedentary  Life should not feed much upon them  The  Animal Oils Cream Butter  and  Marrow  are all lenient and nourishing Marrow is excellent in the dry Scurvy with crackling of the Bones where it performs its natural Office  Of all Drinks  Whey  is the most relaxing so are warm Water and Decoctions of mealy Substances and  Panadas  or Bread boil'd in Water  Diluting Substances  Water  and  watery Liquors  without any saline Substance Decoctions of  mealy Substances Robs  and  Gellies  of Garden Fruits in Water  Resolving  is bringing a Fluid which is new concreted into the State of Fluidity again Such are  All Substances which are saponaceous or contain Salt and Oil therefore most ripe  Garden Fruits  have this Quality and  Honey  most of all vegetable Substances Mere diluting dissolves and carries off Salts  Antiacid or contrary to Acidity or Sourness are  All  Animal Diet  in general because no Animal has any acid Salt in it especially Flesh roasted tho' not so easy of Digestion as boil'd  The  Animals  which feed on other Animals must have this Quality stronger than those who feed on acid Vegetables such are most Fishes all Birds which feed upon Worms and Insects several Kinds of WaterFowl Woodcocks Snipes and several Kinds of small Birds which for that Reason afford a higher Aliment than those that feed upon Grains or other Vegetables  The  Flesh  of  Animals  differs according as they are terrestrial aquatick or amphibious Fishes contain much  Oil and amphibious Animals participate somewhat of the Nature of Fishes and are oily and the same Species of Animals differs according to the Soil and Air it lives in and the Nourishment which it takes as those in Marshes and Mountains the Flesh of Oxen Sheep Deer in different Pasturage and this is in none more sensible than in Hogs Flesh  Young Animals  from their Age and the Nature of their Aliment have more tender Fibres and more superfluous Humidity than old Animals which have their Fibres tougher and the Juices more exalted and relishing  Mutton  by Experiment is the most perspirable of all animal Food and Hogs Flesh and Oysters the least  The  Flesh  of  Animals  which take and digest a great Quantity of Food and consequently use strong Exercise must be nourishing because they have strong Sanguification such are  Pigeons and the same is true of some Fishes  The Nature of most sort of animal Diet may be discovered by Taste and other sensible Qualities and some of those general Rules abovemention'd without particular Disquisitions upon every Kind  Eggs  are perhaps the highest most nourishing and exalted of all animal Food and most indigestible because no body can take and digest the same Quantity of them as of other Food  ShellFish  are nourishing and their Oil is corrected by their Salts which make it pungent and stimulating  But as was said before all Animal Diet is Antiacid or Alkalescent  Vegetables used in Aliment antiacid are such as of themselves turn foetid or stinking rather than four  All the  Cole  or  Cabbage  Kind  Asparagus  diuretick or aperient by the foetid Smell which it gives  the Urine it is suspected to be hurtful to the Kidneys  Parsley  and  Celery  both contain a pungent Salt and Oil diuretick and aperient bad in BloodyFluxes  Garlick Rockambole Onions Shalot Leeks  these abound with a pungent volatile Salt and Oil are extremely diuretick and when stimulating Diureticks may be safely us'd are very effectual Garlick has been found by Experience to be a very excellent Remedy in Jaundices and Dropsies and in Asthmas proceeding from a cold viscous Phlegm All these Plants are hurtful in Cases where the Blood is too much dissolv'd in Spitting of Blood and bloody Urine  Cresses Radishes HorseRadishes Mustard  abound likewise in their several degrees with a pungent Salt and as they subdue Acidity are very improper where the Blood verges to the contrary State of a putrescent Alkali and in general they are fitter  for old People and cold Constitutions than the young and sanguine Mustard is a very powerful Remedy in viscous cold phlegmatick Cases  Dilse  a SeaPlant antiscorbutick There are other Sea Plants us'd as Aliment which contain a temperate SeaSalt very useful in Scurvies as Laver which is the  Lactuca Marina  or SeaLettuce and SeaCole or Cale  Carrots Turnips Parsnips  are Antiacids of a milder Kind  Nettles  good against Haemorrages  Such as abound with a soft Oil which operate by blunting the Acrimony of the Salts as most sorts of  Nuts  most of which are hard of Digestion yet possess some good medicinal Qualities  Walnuts  are cordial antihysterick and gently sudorisick  HazleNuts  good against Spitting of Blood  Chesnuts  are good in Female Weaknesses and afford a very good Nourishment  Almonds  Pectoral  Pistachos  nourishing and stimulating  Olives  are antiacid by their Oil but all oily Substances beget an Acrimony of another sort  Truffles  which have an exalted Oil and a volatile Salt of a grateful Savour are heating  Morelles  have some of the same Qualities and so have  EarthNuts  and  Potatoes  which are very nourishing  Mushrooms  which contain an Oil of a volatile Salt therefore they are best corrected by Vinegar some of them being poisonous make the rest suspicious the poisonous Kinds operate by a sort of Suffocation in which the best Remedy is Wine or Vinegar and Salt and Vomiting as soon as possible  Acidity is likewise cur'd by diluting therefore  Water  is an Antiacid  Acid Substances are  Most ripe Garden Fruits fermented Liquors small Wines with little Oil and much Tartar Vinegar sour Milk ButterMilk Several Plants known by their Taste as Sorrel  c  Those of the mealy Kind are acescent that is being kept they turn sour rather than corrupted and stinking  Those things which resolve glutinous and fat Substances are  Spices  as Cinnamon Mace Nutmeg Cloves Ginger Pepper These abounding with a high exalted Oil and volatile Salt by which Principles they are heating and act strongly both on the Fluids and Solids Ginger is perhaps one of the best of  them All Spices are bad for melancholy People  Of the same nature are the  Vegetables  used in Seasoning as Thyme Savory Marjoram Rosemary Mint Orange and LimonPeel Fennel which contains a subtil Spice balsamick warm and stimulating Chervil of the same nature they are good in phlegmatick cold Constitutions Sage is stimulating drying astringent us'd in great Quantities it will produce Temulency or Drunkenness  All  Soaps  and  Soapy Substances  and consequently ripe Fruits the Juices of pungent and aromatical Plants all those Substances resolve Solids and sometimes attenuate or thin the Fluids  Stimulating  All  Salts  in general both acid and alkaline all acrimonious  Oils  and  all Substances that abound with them for by their Oil they obstruct the Extremities of the small Vessels and by their Salts they irritate the Solids consequently all the Substances mentioned in the foregoing Article are stimulating and all fermented  Spirits  the Effect of which is very sudden  Extreme  Cold  stimulates producing first a Rigor and then a glowing Heat those things which stimulate in the extreme degree excite Pain  Incrassating or Thickeners of the Humours are  All things which expel the liquid Parts strongly so as to thicken what remains Therefore violent Exercise or Labour produceth this Effect the Blood of labouring People is more dense than that of the sedentary A due Consistence of the Blood is very necessary for Health and this is acquir'd chiefly by Exercise all  things which provoke great Secretions especially Sweat produce this Effect at last  What renders the Blood acrimonious or sharp  Are such things as increase its Velocity for by mutual Attrition Salts are produc'd  Whatever attenuates the Humours  Whatever resolves Concretions and turns them fluid for whatever putrifies is acrid  Acrimony  is threefold  Acid  which is produc'd from Vegetables lying long in the Stomach no animal Substance produceth Acidity except Milk  Great Quantities of  Oily Substances  for  Animal Humours  by Heat stink and grow foetid like Oil  Express'd Oils  are mild  Distill'd Oils  turn acrid  Oils  entirely deprav'd of their Salts are not acrid  Alkaline Acrimony  is produced by fix'd Salts by fix'd Alkalis and volatile Alkalis taken in great Quantities and by essential Salts of Vegetables of which sort are Sugar Manna and Honey  Alkaline Acrimony  is produc'd by all Vegetables which abound with a pungent volatile Salt and Oil as Mustard Garlick Onions HorseRadish Cresses and by all Spices All things which create Pain render the Humours sharp  Abaters of Acrimony or Sharpness  Express'd  Oils  of ripe  Vegetables  and all Preparations of such as of Almonds Pistachos and other Nuts  Emulsion of the Seeds of Barley Oats  c  Decoctions of farinaceous  Legumes  as Pease Beans  c  Native Animal  Oils  as Fat Cream Butter Marrow especially the last which is excellent in some Scurvies  All insipid inodorous  Vegetables  are demulcent  Jellies Broths  of Animal Substances not high seasoned acid Substances in respect of alkaline and alkaline in respect of acid  Fermented burning  Spirits  subdue Acidity and are very often a present Remedy when the Stomach is affected with it Spirit of Wine dulcifies Spirit of Salt Nitre or Vitriol but then those Spirits have other bad Effects  Absorbents as Chalk Crabs Eyes but these are not alimentary except calcin'd Hartshorn which has something of this Quality  Nothing abates Acrimony of the Blood more than an equable Motion of it neither too swift nor too slow for too quick a Motion produceth an alkaline and too slow an acid Acrimony  Coagulators of the Humours  Those things which expel the most fluid Parts as in the Case of incrassating or thickening and by those things which suck up some of the fluid Parts as Absorbents  All  Vegetables  which make a black or purple Tincture with the Vitriol of  Mars  such as Galls do Juices of unripe Vegetables and the juices of all austere Vegetables which coagulate the Spittle and being mix'd with the Blood in the Veins would produce Polypus's in the Heart and Death  All burning fermented  Spirits  have this Quality in a strong degree  Those things which accelerate the Motion of the Blood are  All stimulating diluting and attenuating Substances what relaxeth the Veins as Frictions Bathings  Compressions by Ligatures often remov'd Sneezing Coughing Laughing and several other natural Motions  Those things which take off the Causes of Acceleration retard the Motion of the Blood  Those things which increase Milk  What generates quickly a great Quantity of Chyle as thin Broths Ptisanes of Barley or Oatmeal Panadas but nothing more than Milk with Salt and Sugar Cream if the Milk be not too thick Malt Drink not strong or stale a due degree of Exercise or Labour Eating much FleshMeat abates Milk  Substances expectorating  Such as cleanse and open as mild vegetable Oils such as that of Almonds or Olives soapy Substances  especially Honey Emulsions of farinaceous Substances Decoctions of emollient Vegetables Sugar  Sometimes stimulating Substances are necessary to dissolve viscid Phlegm and excite a Cough  The mild Vapour of warm Liquids especially warm Water  And such things as are endued with an opiate Quality by incrassating the Phlegm  Lenitive or laxative of the Belly  Animal Oils fresh Butter Cream Marrow Fat Broths especially of those Parts which are about the Mesentery Livers of Animals because of the Bile which they contain the express'd Oils of mild Vegetables as Olives Almonds Pistachos and the Fruits themselves all oily and mild Fruits as Figs Decoctions of mealy Vegetables these lubricate the Intestines some saponaceous Substances  which stimulate gently as Honey Hydromel or boil'd Honey and Water and even Sugar it self especially unrefin'd  Such  lenitive  Substances are proper for dry atrabilarian Constitutions who are subject to Astriction of the Belly and the Piles and will operate when stronger medicinal Substances are sometimes ineffectual but such lenitive Diet hurts those whose Bowels are weak and lax  Lenitive  are likewise watery Substances and even common Water or Whey drank in cool Air and walking after it sour Milk and Butter Milks have the same Effect  There are other Substances which stimulate more even new Milk especially Asses Milk when it sours on the Stomach and Whey turn'd sour will purge strongly  Jellies made of the solid Parts of Animals contain a sort of ammoniacal Salt ShellFish as Oysters the same by which they are lenitive  most Garden Fruits by the Salts which they contain produce the same Effect some of them as Grapes will throw such as take them immoderately into a  Cholera Morbus  or incurable Diarrhoeas all Fruits when they have this Effect are flatulent Wine and spirituous Liquors are not so useful in such a windy Colick as Water which is much the best Remedy after a Surfeit of Fruit The express'd Juices of several Vegetables because of their essential Salts stimulate the Bowels  All fossil Salts as SeaSalt RockSalt  c  have this Quality a Diet of salted Flesh throws Ships Crews sometimes into Diarrhoeas  Diuretick  All  Decoctions Emulsions Oils  of emollient Vegetables such relax and lubricate the Urinary Passages they ought to be taken in an empty  Stomach an open Air and with gentle Exercise  Diluents  as Water Whey Tea small Ale without Hops  Substances stimulating  by which Quality all Salts whatsoever are diuretick  Soaps  which resolve solid Substances any Salt Oil Salads of pungent Herbs with Oil of Olives and Vinegar are diuretick  By this saline Quality the Juices of ShellFish of Oysters Muscles Crabs Crawfish and the Soups made of them are diuretick  Vegetables which have little Oil and a great Quantity of essential Salt are diuretick Parsley Celery Sorrel Chervil Eringo  Vegetables which are aromatick and balsamick Saffron Asparagus Nutmeg these affecting the Urine with an Odour have some specifick Quality of this Kind  All  anodyne  Substances which take off Spasms and Contractions of the membranous Parts and all which subdue any particular Acrimony are diuretick  For provoking of Urine one should begin with the gentlest at first as the lenient relaxing diluent demulcent and last of all the stimulating  The Blood may be cleans'd and the Salts of it carried off perhaps better by Urine than any other Secretion  Sudorificks  Such things as relax the Vessels of the Skin by which Quality many things which are diuretick are likewise sudorifick warm Water and Honey BarleyWater Friction and tepid Vapours apply'd to the Skin operate by this Quality  Substances anodyne by abating Spasms relax and by that Quality prove sudorifick  Such things as dissolve and dilute the Blood thus cold Water  Water Vinegar and Honey is most excellent Sudorifick us'd by  Hippocrates  it is more effectual with a little Mace added to it  Those things which determine the Motion of the Fluids towards the extreme Parts increase the Strength and Frequency of the Pulse as violent Exercise all Cordials Spices thin and sharp Wines Juices of Limon operate by these Qualities  The Matter of Sweat is the most spirituous and nutritious Part of the Blood nor is it to be forced without apparent Indications It contains the same lixivial Salts with Urine  Sweating often thickens the Blood and sometimes thins and dissolves it  Sudorificks are to be varied according to the Cause of the Disease which it is design'd to remove  Diaphoreticks or Promoters of Perspiration  What helps the Organs of Digestion because the Attenuation of the Aliment makes it perspirable  Such things as constrict the Fibres and strengthen the solid Parts Exercise to a degree less than what provokes Sweat  Substances which stimulate in a small degree  Air moderately warm  There are likewise Aliments more and less perspirable  See  Sanctorius  Emenagogues  Such as produce a Plethora or Fulness of the Vessels consequently such as strengthen the Organs of Digestion  so as to make good Blood especially Exercise such as carry off the Foeces and Mucus deobstruct the Mouths of the Lacteals so as the Chyle may have a free Passage into the Blood  Substances saline or soapy that is consisting of Salt and Oil  Such as relax and take off the Resistance of the Vessels of the Womb Fomentations and tepid Bathings of the lower Parts of the Body  What accelerates the Reflux of the Blood from the lower Parts to the Heart Friction Walking especially Dancing  What stimulates and promotes the Excretion of the Blood especially some of the Plants which abound with a pungent Salt and a high exalted Oil as those us'd in seasoning Aliment Savory Thyme Marjoram PennyRoyal  c  Vapours acrimonious  Heat is produc'd in animal Bodies  By the Application of hot things By increasing of Attrition or Rubbing of the Fluids and Solids to which Heat is proportional  Therefore whatever increaseth the Velocity of the Blood by stimulating heateth as spirituous fermented Liquors and when the Heat is increas'd the Velocity of the Blood is certainly increas'd  What increaseth the Density of the Fluids heateth for a denser Fluid is hotter than a rarer and thus it is that Cold it self at last heateth  Whatever straitens the Vessels so as the Channels become more narrow must heat because in that Case the Attrition is made greater therefore strait Clothes thick Coverings heavy and cold Air but especially cold Baths heat All who are subject to Haemorrages ought to avoid these  things In Consumptions and Atrophy the Liquids are exhausted and the Sides of the Canals collapse therefore the Attrition is increas'd and consequently the Heat  Cold is produc'd in animal Bodies  By Causes contrary to the former  viz  By whatsoever diminisheth the projectile Motion of the Blood by weakening the Force of any Stimulus therefore diluting things are cooling as Whey Water Milk and Water both as they abate Acrimony and relax the Vessels  What is contrary to any particular Acrimony is cooling as alkaline Substances in respect to acid and acid Substances in respect of alkaline and soapy Substances if the Heat proceeds from an oily or viscous Cause  What expels any Stimulus out of the Body cools  Those things which attenuate and dilute by diminishing the Density of the Fluid thus Nitres and those Vegetables which have nitrous Salts in them cool  Tepid Baths cool by relaxing the Vessels and Air when it is light is more cooling  caeteris paribus  than when it is heavy because it compresseth the Vessels less  All those who have lax Fibres and Vessels are naturally cooler than those that have strait  Cephalick  Such things as attenuate the Fluids which circulate through the capillary Vessels of the Brain and abound with a volatile Oil Salt and Spirit and are known commonly by a grateful Flavour and Odour as Marjoram Balm Sage Rosemary  Those things which affect the Nose with a grateful Smell and are not  hot by their Odour promote the Separation of the Animal Spirits  Cordial  Are all such things as increase and facilitate the animal or natural Motions the Power of moving the Muscles or circulating the Fluids  What increaseth the Strength of the Heart is not always a Cordial for in inflammatory Distempers by increasing the projectile Motion of the Blood the Strength may be diminished  What increaseth the Force of the Heart so as to give a due degree of projectile Motion to the Blood is a Cordial  What produceth a due Quantity of Animal Spirits necessarily facilitates the animal and natural Motions  Such are all Aliments which put the nutritious Juices in such a State  of Tenuity and Heat as approacheth to the White of an Egg while it is hatching those are commonly Meats and Drinks of easy Digestion nourishing of a Flavour grateful to most Palates  Such as determine and settle the irregular Motions of the Animal Spirits therefore anodyne Substances and what abate Spasms and Convulsions are Cordial  Such as stimulate and excite the Spirits as Spices and Vegetables which abound with a volatile Salt Oil and Spirit  In short whatever relaxeth the too strict Vessels or straitens the too lax what thickens the too thin or attenuates the too thick Fluids is a Cordial  Carminative or Expellers of Wind  Wind is elastick and rarify'd pent up in some Vessel of the Body  which by its Expansion creates a Tension or Convulsion in that Part  Every thing which takes off that Convulsion is properly speaking carminative  Therefore what relaxeth or openeth so as the clastick Air may escape as warm Water drank plentifully Bathing Fermentations and all things which abate Pain and those things which abound with volatile oily Salts are carminative  As those Spasms are often occasion'd by some acrimonious Substance which constringeth the Fibres of the affected Part whatever is contrary to that particular Acrimony is carminative  Anthelmintick or contrary to Worms  All things which are known by Experience to kill them as Oils of all Kinds Honey taken upon an  empty Stomach or after some gentle purging Medicine  Substances which by their small pungent and sharp Particles kill them without hurting the Intestines as all Fish Bones and Hartshorn powder'd  Those things which purge and expel them out of the Body of which kind there are several alimentary Substances  Anodyne or Abaters of Pain of the Alimentary Kind  Such things as relax the Tension of the affected nervous Fibres as Decoctions of emollient Substances those things which attenuate and remove the Obstruction or destroy the particular Acrimony which occasions the Pain or what deadens the Sensation of the Brain by procuring Sleep some Alimentary Substances are endued with this Quality as Saffron  Lettuce Cichory Wine and inflammable Spirits  This being a sort of a compendious Alimentary Dispensatory makes it unnecessary in the following Rules to repeat constantly the same things it being sufficient to mention the Intention or Design to be pursued in the Diet  When there are Contraindications that is when different Symptoms demand opposite Methods one must adapt the Method to the most urgent Symptom  When the Disease is complicated with other Diseases one must consider that which is most dangerous These may serve for general Rules  CHAP II  Rules of Diet in the different Constitutions of Human Bodies  Lax and weak Fibres  PAleness a weak Pulse Palpitations of the Heart flabby and slack Flesh Laziness Lassitude Bloatedness scorbutical Spots are Symptoms of weak Fibres  Leanness is no Sign of weak Fibres for though the bundle of Fibres which constitute the Muscle may be small the Fibres themselves may be strong and springy  Such as have weak Fibres ought to avoid all great Evacuations especially Letting of Blood Substances viscous and hard of Digestion a sedentary Life and moist Air  They ought to take Aliment frequently in small Quantities nourishing  and of easy Digestion such as Milk Broths and Jellies of Flesh Meat Panadas  c  Their Drinks ought to be austere Wines mix'd with Water or any Wine mix'd with chalybeat Water and to use in their Aliment styptick austere Vegetables such as are enumerated N  o  as far as their Stomachs can bear them  Too strong and springy Fibres  A Body hard dry scraggy hairy warm with firm and rigid Muscles a strong Pulse Activity and Promptness in Animal Actions are Signs of strong rigid and elastick Fibres  Such Constitutions are subject to inflammatory Distempers  They ought to avoid the Diet proper in the contrary State  Their Nourishment ought to be emollient and cooling the Pulps Juices Jellies Mucilages and Decoctions of Vegetables mentioned  N  o  animal Oils and all things which relax and increase Fat avoiding all things seasoned with Spice and Salt Their Drink Water BarleyWater Whey and especially to avoid fermented Spirits which to such are extremely hurtful  Bathing in tepid Water is beneficial to such Constitutions and immoderate Labour or Excercise hurtful  Plethorick Constitutions  The Signs of a Plethorick Constitution or of such as abound with laudable animal Fluids are evident  The Causes of it are a good Stomach nourishing Diet a good Digestion little Exercise much Sleep and Suppression of usual Evacuations especially Perspiration therefore the avoiding these and inducing their Contraries are the proper Cure  A plethorick Constitution is subject to a Stoppage of the Circulation and consequently to Suffocation Ruptures of the Vessels and sudden Death therefore it ought to be speedily broke by proper artificial Evacuations and restoring the usual natural ones  Long Abstinence is not proper for plethorick Constitutions for it thickens the Fluids frequent Bloodletting in small Quantities often increaseth the Force of the Organs of Digestion fattens and increaseth the Distemper  They ought to avoid oily and nourishing Substances watery Vegetables as being less nourishing than animal Diet are proper and Fish rather than Flesh In a  Lent  Diet People commonly fall away  Sanguineous Constitutions  Such are known by their Complexion or Colour of their Countenance and Skin They are subject to Haemorrages Inflammations especially of the Lungs Impostumations and often to scrophulous Distempers  All things which accelerate the Motion of the Blood are hurtful to sanguineous Constitutions as violent Exercise and Watching  Acid Substances N  o  especially Vinegar are useful the copious Use of Vinegar brings Paleness  The sanguineous ought to avoid the copious Use of all things that abound with an acrimonious Salt and high exalted Oil as Mustard Onions Garlick Leeks the Herbs us'd in Seasoning mention'd N  o  and in general all Spices  Constitutions subject to Acidity  Sour Belchings a craving Appetite sometimes of unusual things as in the Case of the GreenSickness Colical Pains dry Gripes change of the colour of the Bile from Yellow towards Green a sour Smell in the Excrements and Sweat paleness of the Skin lowness of the Pulse and some sort of Eruptions of the Skin are the common Signs of such a Constitution  The chief Seat of Acidity is in the Stomach and Intestines from whence it will sometimes pass into the Blood and other Juices  Such ought to abstain from the copious use of acid alimentary Substances mention'd N  o  they ought not to eat much Bread nor take grea  Quantities of mealy Substances no  drink much of fermented Liquor especially sour and thin Wines  Their Diet ought to be rather of animal Substances than vegetable The Flesh of those Animals which live upon other Animals is most antiacid as several Birds and WaterFowl tho' those are offensive to the Stomach sometimes by reason of their Oiliness Vegetable and animal Oils are often agreeable to such Stomachs as Almonds Pistachos Cream Butter Marrow  Their Diet ought to consist in general of Substances mentioned N  o    Water or Wine not sour or thin is their proper Drink  They ought to use much Labour or Exercise for labouring People have commonly a good Digestion and subdue the Acidity of their Aliment  Acidity in the sucking Infant is to be cured by an alkaline Diet in the Nurse  To know whether Eruptions of the Skin come from an acid or alkaline Cause one must attend to the previous Diet and the concomitant Symptoms Children by eating unripe Fruit often have Eruptions upon their Skin the Lentor itching Colour and State of such Eruptions not inflammatory nor tending to Suppuration point rather to an acid Cause and the Success of the Cure often demonstrates the same such being often heal'd by animal alkaline Salts  Constitutions abounding with a spontaneous Alkali  This Constitution is more natural to Human Bodies because all animal Substances are alkalescent  Heat Thirst hot nidorose Belchings Foulness of the Tongue and Palate a bitter and hot Taste in the Mouth Sickness Loathing bilious  Vomitings Stools with a cadaverous Smell Pains in the Belly with Heat are Symptoms of an alkaline State of the Humours in the Stomach and Bowels  Such a State disposeth the Humours of the whole Body to Heat Inflammations and Putrefaction hinders Nutrition and often causeth Eruptions on the Skin dark livid leadcolour'd and gangrenous and what is commonly called the hot Scurvy  Such Constitutions ought to avoid alkaline Substances mentioned N  o    viz  an animal Diet especially Fat Spices and all Vegetables which abound with an acrimonious Salt and high exalted Oil and the copious use of Salts in general all animal Salts are alkaline SeaSalt and RockSalt tho' they are of a mix'd Nature rather increase the Disease SaltPetre is the most cooling and proper  They ought to use plentifully the acid Substances mentioned N  o  to live much upon Aliments made of Grains or mealy Substances to eat much Bread and season much with Vinegar thin Wines Wine mix'd with Water Water with Juice of Limon and especially Milk and Water are proper Drinks  Those who feel no Inconvenience in taking Acids ought to take them plentifully  People of such Constitutions ought not to use violent Exercise nor long Abstinence which disposeth to such a State and after long Abstinence they ought not to eat plentifully they ought to use liquid rather than solid Aliment  Plethorick Constitutions are subject to fall into this alkaline State of the Fluids which is more dangerous than that which proceeds from Acidity for the Bile which is here redundant is the strongest Antiacid  and when it is highly exalted and acrimonious is capable of producing all the dreadful Symptoms of malignant and pestilential Fevers as is evident from the Experiments that were made in the Plague of  Marseilles  There is nothing corrects the Acrimony of the Bile so much as the acid Diet abovementioned therefore one cannot be too early and quick in discerning a Tendency to such a State and observing if the Person be plethorick hot or dry if the Air be hot if bilious Fevers reign if there be any Acrimony in the Faeces Urine Sweat or a yellow Cast in the Skin with the Signs abovementioned by an early Application of proper Remedies many dangerous and fatal Diseases might be prevented  Phlegmatick Constitutions  Sickness of the Stomach a Sense of Fulness without eating Crudities  or Meat remaining in the Stomach undigested Dejection of Appetite Wind coming upwards but especially tough Phlegm frequently rejected by Vomiting Inflations and Tumors of the Belly sometimes short Breath and Paleness are Signs of a phlegmatick Constitution when a Child grows pale and his Belly swells as happens to those that are rickety there is certainly tough Phlegm in the Intestines which commonly shuts up the Mouths of the Lacteals and hinders the Nourishment from passing Persons of such Constitutions ought to avoid mealy Substances unfermented unripe Fruits and all viscous Nourishment they ought not to let Blood except upon urgent Occasions nor provoke Sweat which thickens the Humours  Their Diet ought to be alkalescent of Substances mentioned N  o  because whatever brings them into an alkaline State is a proper Cure for  the Disease therefore soapy Substances which consist of a pungent Salt and volatile Oil Spices Salt Garlick Onions Leeks and the warm Vegetables us'd in Seasoning Thyme Rosemary Savory Basil Marjoram and in general every thing which exalts the Bile for bilious and phlegmatick Constitutions are opposite and even Children so diseas'd ought to use a warmer Diet than what seems proper to their Age without it  Phlegmatick Persons ought to drink fermented Liquors and generous Wines such as put the Blood in a vigorous Motion Warm Water dissolves Phlegm but it relaxeth too much  Thickness of Blood  Thirst Leanness Excess of animal Secretions as of Urine Sweat liquid Dejections too strong a Perspiration  are Signs and Effects of too great Thinness of Blood  For such the Diet prescrib'd in Debility or Weakness of Fibres is useful Milk boil'd with Grains especially Rice rather solid than liquid Aliment and austere Wines for Drink  Oily or fat Constitutions  Fat People ought to eat and sleep little and use much Exercise in which the Cure chiefly consists  Whatever heats moderately stimulating Substances abounding with a pungent acrid Salt as Mustard HorseRadishes Garlicks Onions Leeks Spices and the aromatick Plants us'd in Seasoning Saffron carminative Seeds Meats high season'd with Salt Pepper and Vinegar are all proper and dissolve Fat they have only one Inconvenience that they create Thirst and great Quantities  of Liquids increase the Disease by diluting and relaxing the Solids Salt is a great Dissolver of Fat  Fat People ought to avoid oily Nourishment but Soaps which consist of Oil and Salt are proper because they are resolvent therefore Honey Sugar and ripe GardenFruits are useful  Some of the astringent Substances mentioned No are useful because their Fibres are commonly too lax  Whatever promotes Perspiration and therefore Frictions of the Skin are useful  Their Drink ought to be thin Wines Coffee and Tea as they dilute and stimulate moderately are useful great Quantities of oily fermented Liquors increase Fat mere Water relaxeth too much moist Air is hurtful to fat People by relaxing the Fibres and stopping Perspiration  Melancholy or atrabilarian Constitutions  A Tendency to this is known by Darkness or Lividity of Countenance Dryness of the Skin Leanness a quick penetrating Genius a slow Pulse and Respiration Obstruction of the Belly and too great Application to one Object  To such all things which heat and promote too great a Perspiration as all Substances that abound with an acrimonious Salt and volatile Oil are hurtful which the Reader may see in the First Chapter Nourishment viscous and hard of Digestion and nothing more than salted and smok'd Flesh or Fish in general every thing that thickens the Fluids or reduceth them to a pitchy Condition  Astringent austere Aliment mention'd N  o  and austere Wines are hurtful  Too cold and too hot Air are both hurtful for in such States of Air melancholy Persons are always worst  Diluting is beneficial especially with Water impregnated with some penetrating Salt Substances which cool relax the Belly and resolve the Bile BarleyWater Whey ripe Garden Fruits emollient PotHerbs especially Lettuce Cichory Dandelion and Honey most of all  There is one Caution to be observ'd That the Diet ought to be opposite to the particular Acrimony which occasions the Disease for if it proceeds from too great Acidity in such a Case an animal Diet Broths made of FleshMeat and even Eggs are proper if the Cause be alkaline the contrary Method is useful  Faulty Motion of the Fluids  The Blood and other Fluids of a Human Body are often not only peccant in their Qualities but Motion which may be either too flow too quick or in some of the Vessels totally obstructed  Those who have too slow a Circulation are to be consider'd as in the Case of phlegmatick and fat People and those who have too quick a Circulation are to be consider'd as in the Case of such as are bilious hot and alkaline and the respective Diets are proper  In Obstructions of the Vessels inflammatory the Aliment ought to be cool slender thin diluting avoiding the copious use of Substances of a saline Quality which stimulate and consequently may increase the Inflammations unless in some Cases where there is hopes by  volatile Salts to attenuate the Fluid and remove the Obstruction or where the Intention is to produce a Suppuration but it is certain that any stimulating Substance when it does not remove the Obstruction increaseth the Inflammation  In cold Tumors where the Intention is to dissipate and attenuate the Diet ought to be diluting and stimulating consisting of such Substances as are of a soapy Nature that is of Salt and Oil  Wounds  The Aliment of such as have fresh Wounds ought to be mild that is without stimulating or saline Substances of easy Digestion of such sort as keeps the Humours from Putrefaction and renders them oily and balsamick  When a Suppuration is to be promoted the Aliment ought to be  more copious and warm because such induceth a Putrefaction  When a Sore is healing the Patient is in some measure in the Case of an Infant that is growing whose Aliment ought to be such as lengthens the Fibres without Rupture for it is by such an Elongation of the Fibres that Sores heal and indeed the Chirurgeon ought to vary the Diet of his Patient as he finds the Fibres lengthen too much are too flaccid and produce Fungus's or as they harden and produce Callosities in the first Case Wine and spirituous Liquors are useful in the last hurtful  Women in Childbed are in the Case of Persons wounded  CHAP III  Of Acute Diseases  Fevers with their various Symptoms  RIGOR Coldness  A right Regimen during the Rigor or cold Fit in the beginning of a Fever is of great Importance and Mistakes of dangerous Consequence A long continued Rigor is a Sign of a strong Disease and is in it self an Approach towards Death during the Rigor the Circulation is less quick and the Blood actually stagnates in the Extremities and pressing upon the Heart creates great Anxieties and may produce Concretions about the Heart and in other Parts of the Body therefore a Rigor increaseth an Inflammation Those who die of Quartan Fevers die in the cold Fit and indeed there  is no Mischief but what may proceed from a Rigor of long Duration  In such Rigors all warm Cordials and stimulating Substances are improper for the first acting with force upon the right Ventricle of the Heart may drive the Blood with too much Force through the Lungs and stimulating Substances by constringing the Vessels often increase the Symptom  In such a Rigor nothing is more proper than Water which dilutes and relaxes at the same time and will sooner terminate the cold Fit and throw the Patient into a Sweat than the warmest Cordial if a very small Quantity of Rhenish Wine be mix'd with the Water it will be still more effectual In this Case strong Frictions of the Extremities relieve  Anxieties  In Anxieties which attend Fevers when the cold Fit is over a warmer Regimen may be  allow'd and because Anxieties often happen by Spasms from Wind Spices are useful  In those Anxieties Soapy Substances which dissolve the Blood are indicated ripe Fruits some of the lactescent Plants as Lettuce Endive  c  and especially Honey have this Quality  Thirst  In Thirst attending Fevers Liquors should not be drank quite cold for cold Liquors by constringing the Glands of the Palate and Throat do not quench Thirst so well as Liquors moderately warm In this Case subacid Liquors should be drank plentifully all Salts increase Thirst except Nitre and dulcify'd Spirit of Nitre mix'd with Water is very proper in this Case so are BarleyWater and Emulsions except in great Weakness and Flatulencies of the Stomach in which Case Water mix'd with a small Quantity of Rhenish Wine is best of all  Sickness Vomiting  This is one of the most troublesome Symptoms attending a Fever because it renders the Patient incapable of taking any thing  This Symptom is often prevented by giving a Vomit or cur'd by promoting the Vomiting for a while by tepid Water  During the Symptom acid Liquors and ev'n such as are austere and astringent are indicated because such strengthen the Fibres of the Stomach and indeed Nature directs Patients to such a Diet for they covet subacid Liquors and abhor fat and oily things  Diluting and sometimes relaxing the Belly and carrying the bilious Salts downwards often cures this Symptom  Attention is to be given to the Appetites of Patients in this and many other Cases who have sometimes coveted odd things which  have reliev'd them as Salt Vinegar  c  Vomiting from a bilious Cause is cur'd by subacid Liquors Vomiting from some putrid Cause by Salts of all Kinds in such a Case WaterGruel with Cream of Tartar Rhenish Wine and Water Jelly of Currants Marmalade of Quinces Sorrel boil'd in Broths well skimm'd from Fat are beneficial  If the Vomiting comes from a phlegmatick Cause Spices and bitter things will relieve The Counterpoison must be adapted to the Cause for Example in Poison from Sublimated Corrosive and Arsenick  In the First alkaline Substances in the Second oily Substances are proper in both diluent  It is easy to judge of the Cause by the Substances which the Patient throws up  Whether Vomit may be safely or properly given must be judg'd by the Circumstances if there be any Symptoms of an Inflammation of the Stomach a Vomit is extremely dangerous  Wind  and  Spasms  are occasion'd by the feverish Heat expanding the aerial Particles in the Fluids  Whatever is anodyne and quiets Convulsions and what abates the Heat relieves this Symptom  Weakness  or the Impotence of exercising animal Motion which attends Fevers proceeds from too great Fulness in the beginning and too great Inanition in the latter end of the Disease for whatever stops or retards the Circulation in the smallest Vessels especially those of the Brain which either of these Causes will do produceth this Symptom Those two Causes demand different Methods in the first emptying and diluting  in the latter a more plentiful Nourishment the use of Wine diluted with Water and Spices in small Quantities Jellies Broths the alkalescent Quality of which may be corrected with some acid unless there be Signs of Acidity and in that Case the Diet ought to be contrary to the Cause of the Symptom ViperBroth is both antiacid and nourishing  In Debility from great Loss of Blood Wine and all Aliment that is easily assimulated or turn'd into Blood is proper Blood is required to make Blood a small Quantity of Blood brings the Patient into danger of a Dropsy  Frictions of the extreme Parts relieve Weaknesses as they promote the Flux of the Juices and Spirits in the Joints and Limbs  Fat People are most subject to this Symptom of Weakness in Fevers because the Fat melted by the feverish Heat obstructs the small Canals  and consequently produceth this Symptom This is evident by the great Loss of Fat such People sustain in Fevers In the latter end of Fevers such are weak by the Laxity of the Fibres and the Emptiness of the smaller Vessels such therefore must be treated with particular Care  viz  after due Evacuations diluting strongly both by Drink and Clysters avoiding all things oily and using Sugar Honey and ripe Fruits  Cordials made of spirituous Liquors are not the best Remedies for this Debility tho' they increase the Force of the Heart and are necessary sometimes to keep up the vital Functions they rather coagulate the Fluid they add Strength to the Mill but congeal the Stream Whatever makes the Circulation more free through the small Vessels is a Cordial  Heat  the Degree of which may be known by the Thermoscope the  Sensation of the Patient the Intenseness of the red Colour of the Urine the Sizeness of the Blood the Dissipation of the fluid Parts which renders it thicker the Hardness Strength and Frequency of the Pulse which makes the Friction the stronger to which the Heat is proportional the bad Disposition of the Humour and the dry Temperament of the Body  Feverish Heat is moderated by Bloodletting by muscular Rest by moderate Ligatures which compress the Veins only and often removed from Joint to Joint by a mechanical Reason retard the Circulation of such sort is dry Cupping bathing the lower Parts watery Liquors for Drink not cold but tepid subacid as Jelly of Currants dissolved in tepid watery Liquors Decoctions of mealy Substances acidulated Substances anodyne Substances which dissolve Concretions as Sugar Honey and  the simple Oxymel often used by  Hippocrates  plentiful diluting and restoring as much Water to the Blood as is dissipated by the Heat all demulcent and relaxing Substances cooling the Air in the Room opening the Curtains and removing too thick Bedclothes all stimulating and slyptick Substances to be avoided because they increase the Force of the solid Parts  Delirium  Too great Alacrity and Promptness in Answering especially in Persons naturally of another Temper is a Sign of an approaching Delirium In a feverish Delirium there is a small Inflammation of the Brain therefore any thing which increaseth the Circulation in the lower Parts and diminisheth the Pressure on the Brain is beneficial as immerging the Feet in warm Water nothing relieves the Head more than the Piles therefore Suppositories of Honey Aloes and RockSalt ought  to be try'd relaxing by emollient and watery Substances both in Drink and Clysters especially BarleyCream and BarleyGruel  Coma Sleepiness  A Coma will proceed either from a Pressure upon the Originals of the Nerves by too great Repletion or from a Penury of Spirits by too great Inanition  Old Men are subject to Comas by the Tenacity of the Fluids circulating in the Brain which being resolved by the Fever obstruct the small Canals of the Brain In young People it commonly proceeds from Fulness and is best cur'd by letting Blood and relaxing the Belly The Sign of such a Fulness is a red Countenance and Eyes inflamed if it proceeds from a glutinous Oil it ought to be attempted to be resolv'd by Water nitrous Salts Soaps and subacid Liquors  People recovering from Comas must take at first soft Nourishment and in small Quantities  Watchfulness  This Symptom which is sometimes call'd a Coma Vigil often precedes too great Sleepiness and is perhaps the most illboding Symptom of a Fever  The Expedients in such a Case are extreme Care to keep the Patient from Noise and what makes any strong Impression upon his Senses some of those Helps us'd in a Delirium because this is an Approach towards it a moist softening Diet all Preparations of Barley Emulsions of Poppy Seeds and Almonds Aliment of some lactescent Plants especially Lettuces Decoctions of Scorzonera Roots Almond Cream and what is call'd Winter Flummery us'd as Aliment Tea made of Cowslip Flowers relaxing gently the Belly  Boerhaave  proposes some mechanical Expedients which may perhaps have a good Effect as a soft Noise of Water distilling by Drops into a Bason and the Patient trying to reckon them  The Air perfum'd with the Smell of soporiferous Plants as Poppies Mandrakes Nightshade Bean Flowers  Application of Cloths dipp'd in Vinegar to the Temples  Opiats must never be given but after great Evacuations  Convulsions  It is of the utmost Importance to know the Cause and the Seat of this Disease which is often obscure  In Infants they commonly proceed from Acidity in the Stomach and are cured by terrestrial Absorbents in such indeed Convulsions attending Fevers are not quite so dangerous  Convulsions arising from some Acrimony in the Stomach or from something vellicating a Nerve in its Extremity and not in its Original where it ariseth from the Brain are not very dangerous  Convulsions which arise from great Evacuations as great Haemorrages attending Fevers are dangerous  Convulsions arising from Inflammations of the Membranes of the Brain are commonly fatal The Symptoms attending them are a great Heat a hard Pulse and a Delirium The Remedies and even those from Diet are to be us'd according to the Seat of the Disease  If from the Stomach such Aliments as are contrary to the particular Acrimony Acid Alkaline or Oily residing there as in the Case of Vomiting  If from something impacted in the Brain warm volatile and spicy Substances will increase the Disease  in that Case Substances which relax and dilute are proper especially such as open the Belly which  See in the First Chapter  and in general the Regimen prescrib'd in a Coma or Delirium  Violent Sweats  proceed from a Laxity of the Vessels and too vehement a Circulation of the Blood  Profuse Sweats deprive the Blood of its most fluid Parts thicken and often cause Obstructions it is not good Practice to push Sweating too much in Fevers except in such as are pestilential  In profuse Sweats Care at least should be taken by diluting to restore the Liquid which the Blood loseth and to use the Methods advised in too great Heat by taking away some of the Coverings of the Bed and admitting of cool Air and using a Diet moderately astringent Wine Spices and spirituous Liquors in this Case have often a  good Effect spirituous Liquors thicken the Fluids Sage is a good Remedy in the Case of profuse Sweats  A Diarrhoea Looseness  proves often a dangerous and fatal Symptom in Fevers it weakens excoriates and inflames the Bowels occasions BloodyFluxes thickens the circulating Juices and exhausts the Strength of the Patient notwithstanding a critical Diarrhoea is not to be stopt for fear of incurring these Dangers  Attention is to be given to the Cause of Acidity it is to be cur'd by Antiacids but as in Fevers the Cause is more frequently alkaline and bilious Acid or four things resolve and it happens that oily Substances by blasting the Acrimony will do good in Diarrhoeas Oily Substances of themselves do not irritate or provoke Diarrhoeas they only lubricate or make the Bowels slippery Diarhoeas arising from Quantities of Fruit are often cur'd by Emulsions  Vomiting by evacuating the irritating Cause often cures such Diarrhoeas  Anodyne Substances are proper and generally speaking solid and dry Aliment rather than liquid  Inflammatory Eruptions  In all these of any kind whatsoever as SmallPox Meazles Scarlet Fever Purples the Intention in Diet ought to be to avoid strong Sudorificks which push out too great a Quantity of the Matter upon the Skin to use cooling and temperate Diluents which keep the Matter fluid and moveable so that it may be secern'd from the Blood to keep warm during the Eruption and that then Diet be cool for which Reason the moderate Use of Acids as Juice of Limon is indicated  A due Attention to the few Rules abovemention'd in the several Symptoms will prove very successful in the Cure of most Fevers I shall  only add a few more according to the various Kinds of Fevers and Inflammatory Distempers  An Ephemera or a Fever of one Day is cur'd by Abstinence Rest and Diluting and the same Method will prove effectual if the Fever lasts several Days and is not putrid or attended with a greater Inflammation and Acrimony and Obstruction of the Vessels in some Parts of the Body amongst which is what is commonly call'd a Causus or burning Fever  The Causes of such a Fever are various Errors in the NonNaturals Air Meat and Drink Rest and Motion Such a Fever will be rais'd by Vehement Exercise or Labour Heat of the Sun by long Thirst by the immoderate Use of fermented and spirituous Liquors and hot things as Spices and by great Lassitude endured any way especially in hot Weather  Its Symptoms are a burning Heat in the Skin a Sensation of extreme Heat inwardly sometimes Coldness in the extreme Parts Dryness of the Skin Mouth and Nostrils a Dryness and Roughness of the Tongue laborious and short breathing great Thirst Loathing Sickness of the Stomach and Vomiting Anxiety Restlesness Weariness sometimes a Cough and Hoarseness Watchfulness and Delirium and Exacerbation every other Day  Such a Fever is often resolv'd by a bleeding at the Nose which ought not to be stop'd unless it endangers Life It is likewise often in the critical Day resolv'd by Sweating Vomiting Looseness and Spitting of thick Phlegm The fatal Signs are commonly bloody Urine Difficulty of Swallowing watery Sweats about the Head and Face without Relief Coldness of the Extremities Trembling too great a Looseness and  sometimes an Inflammation of the Lungs  The Regimen in such a Fever is keeping the Air of the Room pure and cool untainted with Fire Smoke or the Breaths of many People they ought to have no more Bedclothes than barely protects them from Cold their Curtains ought to be kept open so as to renew the Air and their Posture in lying as erect as they can bear the Sick in this Condition covet all these things and their Contraries offend them  Their Drink ought to be cool mild subacid tepid given in moderate Quantities and often as Water with Juice of Limon or Tamarinds  Their Aliment ought to be light of farinaceous Vegetables as WaterGruel Preparations of Barley with some Juice of Limon Rice boil'd in Whey and strain'd Roasted Apples in the Progress of the Disease a little  toasted Bread with Rhenish Wine and Water Jelly of Currants Broths and Jellies made of animal Substances are rather too alkalescent at least they ought to be qualify'd with Juices of Limon or some acid  Sometimes such alimentary Substances as gently stimulate the Belly are useful as some ripe Fruits Strawberries Currants Mulberries  The Symptoms increase by the Use of hot things given either as Aliment or Medicine  Intermitting Fevers  They are at least in this Country very obstinate often return in spite of all Remedies and by long Continuance they degenerate into Hepatical Fevers and many chronical Distempers as Jaundice Dropsy Schirrus's and Scurvies therefore in this Disease a right Method both of Medicines and Diet is of great Importance  There is a great Variety in these Diseases as to the Intervals of Times between the Paroxysms Tertians sometimes redouble their Paroxysms so as to appear like Quotidians I think it may be taken as a general Rule That the greater Distance of Time there is between the Paroxysms the Fever is less dangerous but more obstinate  There is a different Regimen to be us'd during the Continuance and Absence of the Paroxysm and in the Paroxysm itself during the Rigor or cold Fit the Heat and the Sweat  During the Rigor the Regimen prescrib'd in the foregoing Part of this Chapter in the Article of Feverish Rigors is proper in all Fevers and Care is to be taken by all proper Methods to shorten that Period as much as possible and by tepid Diluents to bring on the Sweat soon but not to push it beyond its due Measure because an intermitting Fever  relaxeth and weakens the Body extremely  Between the Paroxysms too great Abstinence is hurtful as much as too great Repletion as intermitting Fevers are often of long Continuance extreme Abstinence is impracticable and would reduce the Patient to a Condition not to be able to sustain the Shock of the next Attack  Between the Paroxysms such Substances as temper correct and subdue the bilious Alkali as acid Substances nitrous Salts small thin Wines with Water Chicken Broth with Juice of Limons Wine with Bitters infused are proper Cichory and Dandelion are useful because the express'd Juices of them cure intermitting Fevers in warm Countries the Physicians of these Countries likewise use astringent Vegetables  See  Chap I N  o    Exercise to as great a degree as the Patient can bear is extremely beneficial between the Paroxysms  But the chief Remedy of all is to endeavour to prevent the cold Fit by getting to Bed by Frictions and some sudorifick and warm Liquor for by putting off the cold Fit some Agues have been cur'd  Letting of Blood seldom does good and often a great deal of Hurt in intermitting Fevers but the Condition of the Patient is to be consider'd in this Case  Intermitting Fevers have been observed to free from some Chronical Distempers as the Gout and Convulsions but they often induce great ones themselves  INFLAMMATORY DISEASES  A Phrensy or Inflammation of the Brain  This Disease of all others requires the speediest Applications profuse Haemorrages from the Nose commonly resolve it and copious Bleeding by opening the temporal Arteries are the most effectual Remedies But to stick to my Subject which is the Diet  Substances which cool and at the same time relax the Belly are highly beneficial as Tamarinds boil'd in Water which taken plentifully may at last bring a Looseness which is a great Relief to the Head  Soliciting the Blood to other Parts of the Body therefore tepid Bathings of the lower Parts and procuring the Piles relaxing Fomentations apply'd to the Veins which carry the Blood from the Head relieve in this Disease  Cool Air and Sitting up if possible for the warm Air of the Bed exagitates the Blood  The Aliment ought to be slender of farinaceous Substances as WaterGruel acidulated or subacid ripe Fruits with their Jellies the Drink small diluting and cooling BarleyWater SmallBeer or the Decoction of Tamarinds abovementioned All such gentle Anodynes as are to be found amongst the Alimentary Kind are safe  See  the Articles of Delirium and Watchfulness in this Chapter  Quincy  The Tumour of the Throat which occasions the Difficulty of Swallowing and Breathing attending this Distemper may be of various sorts Sometimes it proceeds from a Serosity obstructing the Glands which may be watery aedematose schirrous  according to the several degrees of the Viscosity of the Humour sometime inflammatory which Inflammation will sometimes end in a Suppuration or Gangrene  The Difficulties of Breathing and Swallowing which happen without any Tumour outward or inward after long Diseases proceed commonly from a Resolution or paralytical Disposition of the Parts and is the immediate Forerunner of Death  The Regimen in those Quincies which proceed merely from the Obstruction of the Glands must be to use such warm Liquors as gently relax soften and moisten those Glands such as carry off the redundant Serum by Stool Sweat and Urine or by stimulating open the Emunctories of these Glands to secern the Humour  See  Chap I    In a more watery Tumour the Diet may be more warm than in the inflammatory and the moderate use of Wine often relieves the Patient  The Difficulty of Swallowing and Breathing occasion'd by Schirrosities of the Glands is not to be cur'd any otherwise than by Extirpation  Those who are subject to Inflammations of the Throat ought to live temperately to prevent a Plethora or to break such a Fulness speedily by proper Evacuations to beware of cold Air too astringent or stimulating Aliment or Medicine and violent Exercise which by increasing the projectile Motion of the Blood heat but especially the swallowing of cold Liquors when they are hot  In these Inflammations a slight Diarrhoea relieves therefore Aliments which promote it are useful as Tamarinds infus'd in Whey Decoctions and Emulsions of farinaceous  Vegetables moderately acidulated and such as abound with a cooling nitrous Salt are proper it is commonly thought that Punpenella Saxifraga or Burnet is a Specifick in this Case Every body knows the Benefit of Mulberries taken all manner of ways All Acids as Sorrel Juice of Limon  c  abate Inflammations  The Mouth and Throat must be kept moist and the Nose clear that the Air may have a free Passage through it for Air drawn by the Mouth dries  When the Deglutition is totally abolish'd the Patient may be nourish'd by Clysters which I have known to have been done for a whole Week after which the Tumour suppurated  When the Inflammation ends in a Gangrene the Case generally proves mortal except it be only in the  Tonsils Uvula  and Palate and go no  further which Parts may be separated and the Patient live  Inflammation of the Lungs  Such may happen either in the bronchial or pulmonary Vessels and may soon be communicated from one to the other when the Inflammation affects both the Lobes and the whole Body of the Lungs the Case is desperate because the Circulation must be stopt and no Blood can flow back into the Heart Besides the general Causes of Inflammations those which affect the Lungs particularly are a bad Conformation of the Lungs and Thorax commonly attended with an Asthma Air too hot cold and moist abounding perhaps with caustick astringent and coagulating Particles the Lungs properly speaking are an outward Part of the Body expos'd to the Air which by its immediate Contact may easily  coagulate the Blood which flows along the Surfaces of the AirBladders and I believe the Qualities of the Air are the general Cause of the Inflammation of the Lungs which happen in the Winter time  As the Lungs are the chief Organ of Sanguification crude and viscous Chyle viscous Aliment Spices but especially spirituous Liquors may occasion this Inflammation too great an Exercise of the Lungs so as to occasion a short and laborious Breathing or keeping them too long upon the Stretch by Vociferation or loud Singing may produce the same Effect There are coagulating Poisons which affect the Lungs very suddenly extreme violent Passions by affecting the Motion of the Heart may do the same it is a common thing to see People in sudden Transports of Anger breathe short Inflammations are sometimes translated from other Parts to the Lungs a Pleurisy easily  passeth into Peripneumony The avoiding those Causes is the best Rule of Diet to prevent the Disease besides speedy and plentiful letting of Blood before it has quite taken place  This Disease is often cur'd by the critical Resolution Concoction and Evacuation of the morbifick Matter which is either attenuated so as to be return'd into the Channels and to go on in the common Thread of Circulation or expectorated by Coughing which may be easily known by the Abatement of Symptoms  viz  the Fever Difficulty of Breathing Thirst Anxiety Restlesness and the Patient's falling into gentle breathing Sweats One of the best Resolvents is the Blood of the wild Goat  Copious Bleeding is the most effectual Remedy in the beginning of the Disease but when the Expectoration goes on successfully not so  proper because it sometimes suppresseth it and in that Case Sudorificks thicken the Matter that is expectorated The Motions of Nature ought to be followed This by the way  From the Symptoms in this Stage of the Disease and the use of the Lungs it is evident the Aliment ought to be more slender and thin than in any other inflammatory Disease whatsoever common Whey being sufficient to preserve the Strength of the Patient watery Liquors and even the Steam of warm Water taken in by the Breath attenuates the impacted Matter Relaxing Aliment of which Barley and all its Preparations are the best  In this State Diureticks which have not much Acrimony in them are proper for Fluxes of Urine relieve the Lungs for this Intention an Infusion of Fenel Roots in warm Water with Milk is good both as Nourishment and Drinks  If Nature relieves by a Diarrhoea without sinking the Strength of the Patient it is not to be stopt but promoted gently by emollient Clysters  Decoction of Cichory Lettuce as being anodyne and resolvent are proper  If the Patient is not reliev'd nor dies in eight Days the Inflammation ends in a Suppuration and an Abscess in the Lungs and sometimes in some other Part of the Body the Symptoms of which are an obstinate dry Cough increas'd by Motion and taking of Food theeasiest Posture in Lying being upon the affected Side a continual LentFever with Rigors invading with uncertain Periods Exacerbations after Motion and Repast Thirst NightSweats a frothy Urine Paleness Leanness Weakness  In such a Case one must forbear letting of Blood The Diet must be mild soft incrassating and more  plentiful tepid Vapours admitted into the Lungs of Decoctions of proper Ingredients and when by the Symptoms and Time the Imposthume may be judg'd to be ripe the Vapour of Vinegar it self and any thing which creates a Cough as Oxymel or Vinegar and Honey Exercise and Concussion are proper the sooner it is broke the less Danger to the Lungs  Tho' such a State is extremely dangerous it is not quite desperate the Aliment ought to be Milk the Drink Milk and BarleyWater and such alimentary Substances as are expectorating and cleansing with gentle Anodynes that the Patient may have some Rest  See  Chap I  The principal Intention in every State of Inflammation of the Lungs is to promote Expectoration and to restore it when it is lost  If the Inflammation ends in a Gangrene the Case is desperate if in a Schirrus incurable  There is a spurious sort of a Peripneumony not inflammatory when the Vessels are obstructed with a viscous Pituite that mixeth with the Blood and invades in cold Weather it is dangerous and often suffocates it is incident to weak and old People In this some of the Methods used in the Inflammatory are proper but not so copious Bleeding Clysters frequently injected Aliment more generous Broths and Jellies with Juice of Limon Hydromel or Honey and Water for Drink soft Oils and Aliments which abound with a soft not volatile Oil are beneficial  A Peripneumony is the last fatal Symptom of every Disease for no Body dies without a Stagnation of the Blood in the Lungs as long as  it circulates through the Lungs it will circulate through the rest of the Body The total Extinction of Breath is caus'd by the Stagnation of Blood in the Lungs  Pleurisy  There is none of the Membranes which invest the Inside of the Breast but may be the Seat of this Disease the Mediastine as well as the Pleura  The Causes of this Disease besides those common to all Inflammations are often a particular Disposition to inflammatory Distempers a Straitness of the Arteries of the Pleura a Callosity of that Membrane an Adhesion of the Lungs the sudden Admission of cold Air by too thin clothing too hot a Regimen and especially the copious use of spirituous Liquors cold Liquors drank when the Body is very hot a Translation  of some inflammatory Matter from some other Part but most of all cold Air from a Northerly or Northeasterly Wind from which Causes proper Cautions may be taken in the Regimen by way of Prevention  This Disease is sometimes dry without any Spitting and sometimes attended with Expectoration from the Lungs and that is taken off by a Coction and Resolution of the feverish Matter or terminates in Suppurations or a Gangrene  The Regimen ought to be much the same as in a Peripneumony a cool relaxing slender diluting Diet and avoiding all things which increase Heat even too hot Air  The Symptoms of Suppuration are the same as in Inflammations of the Lungs when the Matter is made the Side must be opened to let it out  When the Disease is obstinate against all Remedies a sudden Abatement of the Pain a quick weak Pulse sometimes intermitting short Breath and cold Sweats are Symptoms of a Gangrene and approaching Death  Paraphrenitis or Inflammation of the Diaphragm  The Symptoms of this Disease which is often mistaken are a violent Fever a most exquisite Pain increas'd upon Inspiration by which it is distinguish'd from a Pleurisy in which the greatest Pain is in Expiration  This Pain is increas'd by Sickness Vomiting Repletion of the Stomach or any Compression of the Muscles of the Abdomen by rendering the Faeces or Urine The Breathing is extremely quick suffocating  and seems to be perform'd only by the Motion of the Breast It is likewise attended with a Delirium Fury and an involuntary Laughter the Convulsion emulating this Motion  This Disease terminates as Pleurisies and Peripneumonies but is generally fatal if it suppurates the Pus is evacuated into the lower Belly where it produceth Putrefaction and a most miserable and painful Death  The Regimen if any can be successful ought to be the some as in Pleurisies  Inflammation of the Liver  The hepatical Artery and the Vena Porta carry the Blood into the Liver the first being very small and the Motion of the Blood in the last being slow is the reason that Inflammations in the Liver are not so frequent as in  some other Parts of the Body but when they obtain extremely dangerous unless they take up but a small Part of the Liver and such happen more frequently than is commonly imagined  Some of the best Cautions in Diet may be taken from the Causes and Symptoms of this Disease  Which besides the general Causes of Inflammations are extreme Fatness Fat dissolv'd by Heat and Inflammations obstructs the Vessels of the Liver very suddenly Cattle fatted by good Pasturage after violent Motion sometimes die suddenly in such the Liver is found to be inflamed and corrupted An atrabilarian adust Temper of the Blood and Gall an acrimonious or purulent Matter stagnating in some other Organ is more easily deposited upon the Liver than any other Part especially if attended with the use of hot and spicy Aliments spirituous  Liquors great Heat and a Fever▪ Erosions by the Acrimony of the Gall or Obstructions by Viscosity any Callosity Schirrus or Stone in the Liver Thirst long endur'd being suddenly chill'd by cold Air cold Water or drinking cold Liquors after great Heat Vomits given injudiciously when the Liver is already unsound which if they do not remove the Obstruction exagitate the Liver too much inveterate hypocondriacal Distempers All these Causes may produce Inflammations of the Liver  In such a Case the Liver being swell'd compresseth the Stomach Diaphragm and the neighbouring viscera of the lower Belly stops the Circulation of the Juices the Generation and Excretion of the Gall and all Digestion produceth an Infinity of bad Symptoms the Jaundice with all the Diseases depending upon it for the Liver receives the  refluent Blood almost from all the Parts of the Abdomen and is the chief Instrument of all the Digestions which are made there A Fever an Inflammation and pungent Pain on the Region of the Liver and Diaphragm a Tension of the Hypochondres Yellowness of the Skin and Eyes and a Saffroncolour'd Urine are Signs of an inflammatory Disposition of the Liver  This Disease ends as other Inflammations being cur'd either by Resolution Concoction and Excretion of the morbid Matter terminates in an Abscess Schirrus or Gangrene  During the first State a warm Regimen and Saffron which is reckon'd a Specifick is improper  Cooling resolving Liquors taken inwardly as Whey with Sorrel boil'd in it outward Fomentations and frequent Injection of Clysters Bathing and Frictions relax and render the Matter fluid Honey with a little  Rhenish Wine or Vinegar the Juices and Jellies of some ripe Garden Fruits and those of some lactescent papescent Plants as Endive Dandelion Lettuce are resolvent  Violent Purging hurts gently relaxing the Belly relieves Diluents with nitrous Salts are beneficial or Tamarinds boil'd in warm Water or Whey bloody Stools not in an extreme degree or streak'd with Blood ought not to be stop'd because they help to resolve the Distemper and Haemorrages by the Nose often do the same  The feverish Matter is often carried off by Urine and therefore Diureticks not highly stimulating are proper  Sweating ought not to be promoted by warm Cordials but encourag'd by warm diluting Liquors  It is a deplorable Case when the Inflammation terminates in a Suppuration unless the Abscess points outwardly  so as it may be opened for if the Pus be evacuated into the Abdomen it produceth dismal Symptoms Putrefaction or an incurable hepatical Dysentery or BloodyFlux  The Pus from an Ulcer of the Lungs growing thin and ichorose corrodes the Vessels for the Liver of all the Viscera is the most friable and easily crumbled or dissolv'd it is often carried into the Blood and rejected by Vomiting with a cadaverous Smell attended with great Thirst if it is carried downward it occasions a purulent colliquative Diarrhoea acid Substances relieve most in this Case  This Disease may happen to produce a Cancer or Schirrus one cannot say that the last is absolutely incurable because it has been known by Experience that Grass and fresh Pasture has cur'd it in Cattle and perhaps the express'd Juices of Grass  and some opening Plants may do the same thing in Mankind as of the lactescent Plants abovemention'd  The Diet prescrib'd here is necessary in a Jaundice and all Diseases of the Liver and Abstinence from such Substances as induce Putrefaction especially salted Fish and Flesh and above all strong Liquors  Inflammation of the Stomach  The Symptoms of this Disease are a vehement burning fix'd pungent Pain in the Stomach attended with a Fever a great Exacerbation of this Pain the Moment after swallowing any thing succeeded with Vomiting a painful Hickup and great Anxiety The Causes of these Symptoms are those common to all Inflammations a natural Weakness and perhaps Erosion of the Coats of the Stomach and acrid Substances taken as Aliment and Medicines  If this Disease is not speedily cur'd it proves fatal  It terminates in a Cure by a Resolution of the morbifick Matter a Suppuration Schirrus Cancer but most commonly in a Gangrene  Of all Diseases this demands most a total Abstinence from every thing that has Acrimony in it even the nitrous cooling Salts which are beneficial in other Inflammations irritate too much Vomits all Cordials of volatile or spicy Substances spirituous Liquors are no better than Poison and Milk generally curdles Aliments must be given frequently and by Spoonfuls at a time for any Distension increaseth the Inflammation a thin Gruel of Barley Oatmeal Whey with very little Sugar or Honey or ChickenBroth are proper Aliments Whey emollient Decoctions BarleyWater Emulsions are proper Drinks and it has been found by Experience that chalybeat  Waters have been agreeable to the Stomach even in this inflammatory State If there happens an Imposthume Honey and even Honey of Roses taken inwardly is a good Cleanser and Decoctions of Comfrey Roots healing speedy and plentiful Bleeding Fomentations and Clysters have the same good Effect as in other inflammatory Distempers  The same Regimen is necessary in a Schirrus or Cancer of the Stomach though nothing will be quite effectual  The same Regimen is to be observed in the Inflammation of the Spleen Caul Pancreas  Inflammation of the Guts  The Intestines or Guts most frequently the small ones may be inflam'd by any acrid or poisonous Substance taken inwardly from any  purulent Matter translated upon them from some other Part of the Body from Bile extremely acrimonious by a violent Tension from a Convulsion filling them with Wind  The Symptoms are a total Stoppage of the Passage a vehement fix'd burning Pain irritated by things taken inwardly when any thing toucheth the affected Part it excites Vomiting sharp griping Pains with Wind in other Parts of the Bowels the Consequences of such an Inflammation are an Ileus what is commonly called the Twisting of the Guts but is really either a Circumvolution or Insertion of one part of the Gut within the other All these Symptoms are attended with a Fever  It is of the utmost Importance to know what the Causes of Colicks are for as they are various the Remedies in one Case are quite opposite and destructive in the other for  the spicy warm carminative things which are given in a Colick from a phlegmatick or cold Cause are Poison in an inflammatory one they may be distinguish'd by the Fever high Pulse Thirst and flamecolour'd Urine attending the Inflammation as to the Heat tho' it is great likewise by the Violence of the Pain the Extremities grow cold besides there is a sudden Prostration of the Strength or Weakness attending this Colick more than any other  This Disease admits of a speedy Remedy or none for it ends in an Ileus and Mortification of the Bowels very soon  Besides a copious Bleeding there is hardly any other Method but fomenting and relaxing the Bowels by emollient tepid Liquids both taken by the Mouth and by Clysters injected hourly yet it has been known by Experience that Acids have relieved in very desperate Cases as  Juice of Limons taken by the Mouth and Vinegar and warm Water given in Clysters have sav'd the Patient because of the incessant Vomiting Opiats to quiet the Convulsions are sometimes necessary  Warm Fomentations even of warm Animals to the Belly are extremely beneficial  If the Inflammation happens to be in the lower Guts it is not so dangerous and even when it suppurates it admits of a Cure then it can be reach'd by proper Medicines in the Form of Clysters in the latter end of such a Case Chalybeat Waters are beneficial  If the Patient survives three Days the Acuteness of the Pain abates and a Chilliness or Gruing affects the Body it betokens a Suppuration and in a few Days the Matter flows either into the Cavity of the Abdomen producing all the Symptoms which happen in the Imposthumation  of the Liver or into the Cavity of the Intestines and causing a purulent BloodyFlux and often a Consumption  Sinus's Fistulas  Whey and Chalybeat Waters are often beneficial in such a Case as Drinks  The Aliment ought to be of such things as generate little or no Excrements as Broths of FleshMeat with Scorzonera Parsley or Fennel boil'd in them Goats Whey is likewise excellent fat and oily Substances generally hurt  The Continuance of the Fever clammy Sweats Paleness an ichorose Diarrhoea foetid black or like the Washings of Flesh a small intermitting Pulse and at last a total Cessation of Pain are Signs of a Gangrene and approaching Death  If none of the foremention'd things happen if the Fever abates and the Patient complains of a Weight dull Pain Stoppage of the Excrements  a Schirrus is forming which increaseth daily and may terminate in a Cancer which Purging and indeed all Medicines irritate the Patient in such a Case may protract a miserable Life with an exact thin Diet of Whey Broths and such things as produce no Foeces or by alimentary Clysters  A Thrush  By this Name are call'd small round superficial Ulcerations which appear first in the Mouth but as they proceed from the Obstruction of the Emissaries of the Saliva by the Lentor and Viscosity of the Humour they may affect every Part of the alimentary Duct except the thick Guts they often succeed Fevers especially those that inflame the Intestines or are attended with a Looseness and they are just the same in the inward Parts as Scabs in the Skin and fall off from the Inside of the  Bowels like a Crust The nearer they approach to a white Colour the less dangerous  The viscous Matter is to be push'd out therefore Bleeding in the beginning is not proper nor Sudorificks because they thicken but Sweating is beneficial when the Matter is quite push'd out tepid diluent and small Liquors are good in the first State and Bathing if the Patient can bear it with Gargarisms Clysters afterwards the Food ought to be nourishing detergent Panadas with Bread and Water Bread and Milk Honey mix'd with the Aliment when they fall Aliment demulcent soft anodyne and the moderate use of Rhenish Wine when they are separated lenitive purging Substances  Inflammations of the Kidneys  The Kidneys are subject to Inflammations as much as other Parts of the Body  A pungent Pain in the Region of the Kidneys a Stupor or dull Pain in the Thigh Colick Wind Vomiting a Fever Urine sometimes totally suppress'd in small Quantity high colour'd and which is worse sometimes quite pale without any Sediment are Symptoms of an Inflammation of the Kidneys as to the Sensation of outward Heat the Extremity of Pain often creates a Coldness in the Extremities but such a Sensation is very consistent with an inflammatory Distemper  Whatever obstructs the Blood in the Extremities of the Arteries of the Kidneys will produce this Disease a Wound Abscess Bruise Swelling Lying much on the Back too violent  Motion especially walking in hot Weather whatever obstructs the Passage of the Urine as a viscous Matter Gravel or Stone every thing which drives the Blood into the Urinary Canals Heat hard Riding too great Fulness of Blood but especially sharp and forcing Diureticks Lastly Spasms and involuntary Contractions of the Vessels of the Kidneys  Coffeecolour'd Urine is not a dangerous Symptom it proceeds indeed from a Mixture of a small Quantity of Blood with the Urine but often prognosticates a Resolution of the obstructing Matter and the Expulsion of Gravel or a Stone after great Pain pale Urine is a Symptom of a more lasting and dangerous Disease  After plentiful Bleeding and a careful avoiding of all stimulating Diureticks which in this State of the Disease will increase it the Expulsion of the obstructing Cause must  be promoted by emollient and soft Liquors drank plentifully by Clysters of the same frequently injected by Bathing and outward Fomentations by opiat and anodyne Substances which stupify and relax the Fibres those Liquors must be swallow'd down notwithstanding the continual Vomiting for Vomiting is the Instrument of Nature to promote the Expulsion of the Stone Gravel or other obstructing Cause  Whey and in a great feverish Heat ButterMilk Emulsions of Barley and Poppy Seeds Honey in Whey and Water are proper Liquors for this Intention  When the Gravel Stone or other obstructing Cause is separated from the Kidney soft express'd Oils and oily Substances relax the Passages if the Pain proceeds only from Gravel or a Stone oily Substances may be join'd safely with stimulating Substances as with Juice of Limon JuniperWater  and some diuretick Syrrup this by the way for it is out of my present Subject  Violent Motion as jolting in a Coach may be us'd in this Case  The Pain protracted beyond seven Days a Pulsation Chillness often and irregularly returning a Heaviness and Stupor in the Part are Signs of making of Matter which when made will appear in the Urine  In which Case soft and balsamick Substances are beneficial for if the Matter stays long the Case is incurable  It happens sometimes to end in a Fistula with which the Patient may live many Years in no great Uneasifiness ButterMilk not very sour has been reckon'd a great Secret in Ulcers of the Kidneys and Chalybeat Waters have been beneficial to some Spruce Beer is a good Balsamick in such a Case I should advise soft Malt Liquors rather than Wine  Inflammations of the Kidneys sometimes end in a Schirrus or great Stone in the Kidneys  A sudden Remission of the Pain with cold Sweats weak and intermitting Pulse Hickup no Urine or in small Quantity black and foetid are Signs of a Mortification and approaching Death  The Regimen of such as are subject to nephritick Symptoms may be in some measure taken from what is abovementioned  Such ought to be extremely careful of the choice of their Liquors sharp Wines which abound with Tartar are hurtful Malt Liquors not hard nor stale are certainly better to make use of some of the softest Diureticks mentioned  Chap  I N  o  to avoid acrimonious Substances in their Aliment use moderate Exercise and not to lie hot soft nor much upon the Back  Apoplexy  This Disease is a sudden Abolition of all the Senses external and internal and of all voluntary Motion by the Stoppage of the Flux or Reflux of the Animal Spirits through the Nerves destin'd for those Motions commonly attended with a strong Pulse laborious Breathing a deep Sleep with Snorting  There is no difference between a Person asleep and in an Apoplexy but that the one can be awak'd and the other cannot  The Causes of this Disease are a particular Confirmation of the Body as a short Neck for there be some who have fewer Vertebrae in their Necks than others longnecked People are subject to Consumptions and shortneck'd to Apoplexies tho' this Rule is not generally true a gross plethorick fat phlegmatick Constitution  whatever hinders the Motion of the Blood through the Arteries of the Brain as polypose Concretions especially about the Heart attended commonly with an unequal Pulse a Vertigo and sometimes a momentary Loss of the Eyesight an inflammatory and coreaceous Thickness of the Blood preceded by a Fever attended with the Headach Redness of the Face and Eyes Old Age attended with a glutinous cold catarrhous leucophlegmatick Constitution in such the Forerunners of an Apoplexy are Dulness Inactivity Drowsiness Sleepiness Slowness of Speech and giving Answers Vertigoes Tremblings Oppressions in Sleep NightMares Weakness Wateryness and Turgidity of the Eyes pituitous Vomiting laborious Breathing upon the smallest Motion whatever compresseth the Vessels of the Brain so as to stop the Flux of the animal Spirits and Blood a great  Fulness of Blood with its Velocity increas'd by Heat violent Motion a high Diet spirituous Liquors Tumours of any kind within the Skull a partial and imperfect Circulation of the Blood towards the lower Parts The Effusion and Pressure of any Serosity or Blood upon the Ventricles of the Brain which is the most common and immediate Cause of Apoplexies violent Passions and Affections of the Mind The immediate Forerunners of an Apoplexy are commonly a Vertigo Staggering Loss of Memory Stupor Sleepiness a Noise in the Ears and a more deep and laborious Breathing those last Symptoms commonly precede an Apoplexy but they are likewise common to it with other nervous and hysterical Distempers  Attention to the foremention'd Symptoms affords the best Cautions and Rules of Diet by way of Prevention  for when it has taken place  Hippocrates  's Prognostick is generally true That it is very hard to resolve a small Apoplexy and quite impossible to resolve a great one the gentlest Kind of this Disease is often taken off by Sweating  The Applications in the Fit are of the Medicinal Kind it being too acute a Disease to admit of any Helps from Diet but that may be of great use for Prevention a thin slender cool regular Diet opposite to the particular Symptoms abovemention'd frequent and copious Bleeding keeping the Belly always open stimulating Substances which have been thought beneficial in this Case very often hurt by forcing the Blood too much up to the Head Vomiting may prove extremely pernicious but the Regimen is to be varied according to the Cause of the Disease which may be collected from the Constitution of the Patient in these  Apoplexies which depend upon a sanguineous Cause The Regimen prescrib'd in sanguineous Constitutions is proper fat and phlegmatick People who are very subject to this Disease ought to attend to the Rules prescribed in their Case and as there are Apoplexies from inveterate Gouts the Regimen of such must be different from both the Intention being to translate the morbifick Matter upon the Extremities of the Body  Those who have a Disposition to this Disease ought never to go to Bed with a full Stomach nor to lie with their Head low  An Apoplexy is resolv'd by a Fever and when not fatal terminates in a Palsy  There is a Disease of the same Kind but not so frequent call'd a Catalepsis wherein the Patient is suddenly seiz'd without Sense or Motion and remains in the same Posture  in which the Disease seizeth him the Muscles remaining in the same Tension Violent Fevers in strong atrabilarious dry Constitutions has produc'd this Distemper the Diet after the Fit is off ought to be moistening and relaxing A Lethargy is a lighter sort of Apoplexy and demands the same Cure and Diet as an Apoplexy from a phlegmatick Case such being the Constitution of the Lethargick  CHAP IV  Rules of Diet in CHRONICAL DISEASES  Palsy  A PALSY is an Immobility of a Muscle from Relaxation insuperable by the Will or any Endeavour of the Patient sometimes the  Sensation or Feeling is either totally abolish'd or dull with a Sense of Tingling A Palsy is opposite to a Convulsion in the first there is an Ineptitude to Motion from the too great Laxity in the Second an Ineptitude to Motion from too great Tension and a Relaxation of a Muscle must produce a Spasm in its Antagonist because the AEquilibrium is destroy'd The best Rules of Diet in this Disease are taken from the Knowledge of its Causes Whatever stops either the Flux of the Spirits or the Flux of the Blood to any Part induceth a Palsy for both are necessary for Sense and Motion such are all the Causes of an Apoplexy an Epilepsy extreme and lasting Pains the Suppression of usual Evacuations either natural or morbid Translations of morbific Matter in acute Distempers whatever distends distorts compresses or contracts the Nerves strong and  strait Ligatures Luxations Fractures any Inflammation in the Integument or membranaceous Sheath of a Nerve especially in the Ganglia where they are tied together Serous Defluxions Excess in astringent Aliment especially unripe Fruits drinking too much warm Water which is weakning and relaxing Excess in Coffee or Tea extreme Heat extreme Cold poisonous Vapours of Arsenick or Mercury  A Palsy is more or less dangerous according to the Cause the Extent and Seat of the Disease when the Original of the Disease is in the Brain it is most dangerous when it seizeth the Heart or Organs of Breathing fatal because Life cannot be continued a Moment without the Use of those Parts  The Regimen in this Disease ought to be warm attenuating consisting of spicy and cephalick Vegetables such as create a feverish Heat because  such is necessary to dispel the Viscosity Of Vegetables soapy of such as consist of an acrid volatile Salt and Oil Mustard HorseRadish  c  stimulating by Vomits Sneezing relaxing the Belly purging and diluting strongly at the same time promoting Sweat by such Motions as can be us'd or other Means by strong Frictions  c  Bleeding is to be us'd or omitted according to the Symptoms which affect the Brain it relieves in any inflammatory Disposition of the Coat of the Nerve  Epilepsy Convulsions  The Causes of which are sometimes an hereditary or family Disposition from Parents a sudden Fright of the Mother when with Child of the Patient an Affection of the Brain by a Contusion Abscess acrimonious Serum Splinter of a Bone  or sharp Instrument Inflammation Corruption Erosion of the Meninges or Membranes of the Brain Fulness Heat Drunkenness intense Study strong Passions especially sudden Terror all violent Affections and Irritations of the Nerves in any Part of the Body especially by something acrimonious in the Stomach or Bowels by Worms by Teething and Acidity in the Stomach in Infants by some Contagion or purulent Matter after acute Diseases Suppression of usual Evacuations the Menses Haemorroids hysterical Affections contracted by Accidents in Lyingin and often by too great Inanition the smallest irritating Cause will induce a Fit in such as are subject to it and such ought to be prevented with great Care  There is no Disease which insests Mankind more terrible in its Symptoms and Effects the worst of which are a weakening and perhaps an Abolition  of the Faculties of the Mind whether the Cause of the Disease be in the Brain is easily known from the concomitant Symptoms  The Intentions in the Cure of the Disease must be different according to the Cause Bleeding and plentiful Evacuations when there is a Plethora or inflammatory Disposition in the Brain Aliments without Acrimony demulcent avoiding every thing which stimulates taking such things as are opposite to the particular Acrimony which causeth the Disease relaxing the Belly without irritating in acute and periodical Pains anodyne Substances if the Disease is the Consequence of an hysterical Disposition a warmer Regimen is necessary if the Cause is in the Stomach generally antiacid Substances relieve if they are not flatulent several have been cur'd by a MilkDiet but it will do hurt when there is Acidity in the Stomach when the  irritating Cause is in some outward Part of the Body it is proper to eradicate it by Suppuration  The common Custom of applying stimulating things as volatile Salts and Spirits to the Nose during the Fit is generally speaking pernicious  Epilepticks ought to breathe a pure Air unaffected with any Steams even such as are very fragrant Their Diet ought to be nourishing of easy Digestion avoiding Hogs Flesh WaterFowl and all Vegetables that are pungent windy and generally speaking all Fruits especially Nuts with little Wine and none if they have not been accustom'd to it they ought not to turn round nor stand on Precipices to keep regular Hours for Repast and Sleep for every unusual thing is a Stimulus but of all things the most necessary is the avoiding the Occasions of violent  Passions and keeping themselves chearful  Melancholy Madness  The Constitution which disposeth to such a State the Causes Symptoms and proper Regimen in it is describ'd  Chap  II  This being a Disease more terrible than Death extremely obstinate invading sometimes by insensible degrees and hard to be cur'd when it has taken place the Approaches towards it ought to be carefully observ'd  These are commonly obstinate Watchfulness or short Sleeps troublesome and terrible Dreams great Solicitude and Anxiety of Mind with Sighing sudden Fits of Anger without any Occasion given Love of Solitude Obstinacy in defending trifling Opinions and Contempt of  such as are about them Suppression of usual Evacuations as of the Menses in Women and Haemorroids in Men great Heat Eyes hollow and fix'd immoderate Laughter or Crying without occasion too great Loquacity and too great Taciturnity by Fits great Attention to one Object all these Symptoms without a Fever  When this Disease is hereditary it is seldom cur'd  The atrabilarian Constitution or a black viscous pitchy Consistence of the Fluids which most frequently occasions this Disease makes all Secretions difficult and sparing the Intention therefore ought to be to render the Humours fluid moveable and carry them out of the Body especially the Bile which is viscous Sudorificks indeed are  so proper because they thicken  To use the Aliment prescrib  d  Chap  II in atrabilarian Constitutions  Boerhaave  gives an Instance of a Patient who by a long use of Whey Water and GardenFruits evacuated a great Quantity of black Matter and recovered his Senses Cold Bath and especially a sudden Immersion in the Sea has done good by acting upon the Nerves and Spirits whereever there is any Uneasiness or Sensation of Pain one ought to solicit the Humours towards that Part or to make the proper Evacuations from them especially if it be possible to procure the Piles which seldom miss to relieve the Head  The Madness which proceeds from a Plethora or too great Fulness is cur'd by plentiful Bleeding and Purging  The Weakness which succeeds the Madness requires a more refreshing and warm Diet especially the use of Chalybeat Waters  Scurvy  This is a Disease impossible to be defin'd by Words containing any simple or distinct Idea it is rather a Name us'd to denote a Multitude of Symptoms different and sometimes opposite in their Causes and Cures  It is a Distemper of the Inhabitants of cold Countries and amongst those such as inhabit marshy fat low moist Soils near stagnating Water fresh or Salt invading chiefly in the Winter such as are Sedentary or live upon salted and smoaked Flesh and Fish or Quantities of unfermented farinaceous Vegetables and drink bad Water such as are Hypochondriacal and Hysterick and sometimes such as have taken the Peruvian Bark either in great Quantities or without proper Evacuations From these Causes the best Rules are taken for Prevention  Its Symptoms are a spontaneous Lassitude or Sensation of Weariness being unrefresh'd by Sleep laborious Breathing upon small Motion cold Tumours in the Legs going off and returning sometime Paleness or a livid Colour of the Countenance Spots on the Skin of various Colours red violetcolour'd yellow livid sometimes an ill Smell in the Mouth painful and bleeding Erosions of the Gums and by these the Teeth growing bare and loose Haemorrages of all kinds Ulcers untractable especially in the Legs with a gangrenous Appearance in the Skin the Itch a dry crusty Eruption and sometimes a small degree of Leprosy in the Skin the Blood when let black grumous the red part without a due Consistence the Serum saline and of a yellowish Green wandering Pains in the Limbs increasing by the Warmth of the Bed sometimes a feverish Heat  These Symptoms proceed from an ill Temperature of the Blood too thick or too thin being of a saline Constitution either from an acid alkaline or muriatick Cause and according to the Cause demands very different and oftentimes opposite Remedies  See  Part First of acid and alkaline Constitutions  The Scurvy of Mariners is generally cured by Acids as all sorts of ripe Fruits Limons Oranges ButterMilk alkaline Spirits hurt them and acid Spirits as that of Salt does them good when the Symptoms are attended with a Foetor of any kind either in the Urine Mouth Breath with Drought Heat Haemorrage of the Gums or of any kind such a Disease will be cur'd by acescent Substances and none better than Whey In this Scurvy Chalybeat Waters are generally effectual  If the Scurvy be entirely muriatick proceeding from a Diet of salt Flesh or Fish the Vegetables commonly called Antiscorbutick as Watercresses ScurvyGrass and BrookLime may be given with Success but tempered with Acids as the Juice of Oranges and Limons and the PotHerbs which are antiacid in this Case are a proper Diet but if there be a high degree of Heat and Inflammation the hot Antiscorbuticks will do hurt  If the Patient be pale cool without Thirst with pale or natural colour'd Urine with a previous Diet of acescent Substances the Eruptions not of a high inflammatory or livid Colour the warm Antiscorbuticks animal Diet and animal Salts are proper  There is great Attention to be given to the Condition of the Mouth Gums and Teeth in the Scurvy from which the Nature and  Degree of the Disease may be guess'd at  Violent Purging always hurts scorbutick Constitutions lenitive Substances relieve  Bleeding is not proper unless where the Symptoms are urgent and the Case is inflammatory  A Scurvy from an alkaline Cause is more dangerous than from an Acid  Cachexy or ill Habit of Body  This is likewise a general Word to express a great Variety of Symptoms most commonly it denotes such a Distemperature of the Humours as hinders Nutrition and weakens the vital and animal Functions proceeding from Weakness of the Fibres and an Abuse of the Nonnaturals and often from severe acute Distempers It sometimes disposeth to Consumptions sometimes to Leucophlegmacy  Bloatedness and Dropsies it is attended often with Palpitations of the Heart The Rules for Diet must be drawn from the Symptoms  See  Chap I of this Part  Consumption pulmonary  This Disease is a Decay of the whole Body from an Ulcer of the Lungs the Matter of which is mix'd circulates with and infects the Blood and by its Acrimony infects the whole Mass of the Fluids  This Disease makes up above a tenth part of all the  Bills of Mortality  about  London  is often the Product of a scrophulous Constitution or King'sEvil seldom invades after Thirty Years of Age may be prevented but seldom admits of any other than a palliative Cure and is generally incurable when hereditary but easily so when it proceeds from an accidental Cause  It is often preceded by a Spitting of Blood occasion'd by its Acrimony and too great a projectile Motion with Slenderness and Weakness of the Vessels to which Persons of a fair rosy Complexion long Neck and narrow Chest are often subject Aliment too viscous obstructing the Glands and by its Acrimony corroding the small Vessels of the Lungs an Organ of a slender Texture through which the Half of the whole Blood passeth and which is never at rest after a Rupture and Extravasation of Blood easily producing an Ulcer then a small Fever dry Cough Heat Flushing after Repast when the new Chyle enters the Lungs short Breath a Disposition to Sweat after Sleep all these Symptoms when the Blood is most copious and hot between the Ages of and such a Disease may be indue'd by the Suppression of Evacuations natural and artificial by any great  Force upon the Lungs from some accidental Cause by too hot full and acrimonious Meat or Drink by some acute Disease the Meazles or SmallPox  The Blood is ejected from the Lungs with some small Pain Heat Oppression on the Breast florid and frothing with short Breathing and a small soft quick Pulse  If after such Haemorrage from the Lungs the Symptoms increase Shortness of Breath Flushing in the Face a Cough hectick Fever but especially Rigours and Chilliness invading irregularly with Weakness one may be sure that there is a Suppuration  In a Haemorrage from the Lungs no Remedy so proper as Bleeding often repeated Stypticks are often insignificant and if it were possible that they could operate immediately upon the affected Part so far as to make a Scar when that fell off  the Disease would return Both incrassating and styptick Substances work universally but they would hurt the Lungs if given before the Vessels are empty'd Balsamick Substances often hurt by their too great Heat  The Intention here is by Diet to abate the Acrimony and projectile Motion of the Blood after repeated Bleeding to keep strictly to a Milk Diet with farinaceous Substances as Rice and Barley Milk with roasted Apples Jelly of Currants or the Jelly of any ripe subacid Fruit which is cooling and very agreeable to the Stomach Milk and common Water or BarleyWater for Drink taking the Aliment frequently and in very small Quantities for fear of charging the Lungs with too great a Quantity of Chyle at a time  See Part  I  Chap  II Avoiding all violent Motion or any thing that puts the Lungs upon a Stretch Acrimony  is likewise corrected by oily Vegetables not such as contain a volatile or high exalted Oil but those whose Oil is mild as Almonds Pistachos Dates  c  The  English  Consumptions generally speaking proceed from a scrophulous Disposition in the first Access of such a Disease any Substance which is deobstruent without much Acrimony is beneficial but what heats disposeth to Suppuration  There is likewise a Consumption from an Empyema after an Inflammation of the Lungs which may be known from a Weight upon the Diaphragm Oppression of the Lungs a Difficulty of Breathing and Inability to lie on one Side which is that which is found a perpetual Cough and Fever with Thirst Flushing of the Cheeks Weakness and Decay of Appetite  The Cure of such a Case is chirurgical by opening the Side if the  Ulcer is not broke it is commonly call'd a Vomica attended with almost the same Symptoms as an Empyema because the Vomica communicating with the Vessels of the Lungs must necessarily void some of the putrid Matter into these Vessels and taint the Blood  The Ulcer may break suddenly into the Larynx with the danger of Suffocation or inwardly and the Matter may by degrees be expectorated The Event of the Disease depends upon the Symptoms especially the Nature of the Pus that which swims in Water without any ill Smell is better than what sinks is livid and smells of putrify'd Flesh  There may be a Consumption with a purulent Spitting when the Vomica is contain'd in a Cyst or Bag upon the breaking of which the Patient is commonly suffocated  In this Case the same Intentions must be pursued in the Diet as in a Wound or any other Ulcer The Aliment cool demulcent vulnerary and not drying or hot but consisting of Quantities of liquid things even though they provoke Sweat It is a common Mistake that acid things hurt the Lungs The Gas Sulphuris may be given with Success in any Disease of the Lungs but at some distance of Time from Milk Vinegar and Honey is proper and detergent anodyne Substances relieve the Cough gentle Exercise by Riding is beneficial by an extremely exact Regimen a consumptive Person may hold out for Years if the Symptoms are not violent  The Sweats and Diarrhoea attending Consumptions are generally fatal Symptoms but must be reliev'd by a Diet proper in these Cases not interfering with what is formerly advis'd  Consumptions are induc'd by Purulency in any of the other Viscera the Regimen must be very near the same as in the Pulmonary  Dropsy  This Disease is commonly an Extravasation of Serum receiv'd in some Cavity of the Body I say commonly for there may be a Dropsy by a Dilatation of the serous Vessels as that in the Ovarium wherein the very Membrane of the Ovum is extended with the Water and at the same time thickened so as to keep it from Rupture  Therefore this Disease may happen wherever there are serous Vessels a Hydrocephalous or Dropsy of the Head which is only incurable when the Serum is extravasated into the Ventricles of the Brain and generally fatal in Infants when the Sutures  are clos'd and the Skull will yield no more  A Dropsy of the Breast is attended with almost the same Symptoms as an Empyema and cur'd by the same Chirurgery  A Dropsy of the Lungs either by Hydatides or by Lymph extravasated in the Body of the Lungs  A Dropsy in the Forepart of the Windpipe emulating a Bronchocele  A Dropsy in the Ovarium  Testes Scrotum  or  Uterus  An Ascites or Collection of Water in the Abdomen In the Duplicature of the Peritonaeum Between the Peritonaeum and the Bowels When the Water is contained in the membranaceous Coat of the Glands  Sometimes the Air is so rarify'd in the Tumour as makes it hard and tight like a Drum and from thence it is call'd a Tympany when the Tension  is from Air it is easily distinguish'd by the Specifick Gravity of the Patient and so is Water  When the Lymph stagnates or is extravasated under the Skin it is called an Anasarka  Whatever hinders the Return of the Lymph into the Veins or breaks the lymphatick Vessels or obstructs the absorbent Vessels so as the Lymph cannot be absorb'd or exhal'd produceth a Dropsy Any Stoppage of the Circulation will produce a Dropsy as by strong Ligature or Compression  The most common of these Causes are an hereditary Disposition swilling down great Quantities of cold watery Liquors which are not voided violent acute Distempers stubborn Obstructions of the Viscera the Jaundice obstinate intermitting Fevers BloodyFluxes great Evacuations especially of Blood Aliment  viscous and of hard Digestion inveterate Scurvies but the most common of all is the habitual and copious Use of fermented and spirituous Liquors  The Effects are a Swelling of the Legs at Night by degrees still ascending higher a Swelling of the Belly increasing and in a Tympany founding and tense like a Drum sometimes the Sensation and Noise of fluctuating Water Shortness of Breath Thirst Urine in too small Quantity no Sweat The stagnating Serum at last turning acrimonious exulcerates and putrifies the Bowels producing most dismal Symptoms  The best Cautions and Rules of Diet may be taken from the Enumeration of these Causes and Effects  The Intentions to be pursued are removing the Causes as Obstructions  dissolving the Viscosity or Tenacity of the Lymph and evacuating it out of the Body  The Viscosity of the Lymph is best corrected by such Substances as contain abundance of alkaline and volatile Salts Spices acrimonious pungent Vegetables saponaceous Substances what they are the Reader may see Chap I of this Part  The only Contradiction to this is too great Heat and Thirst to which Regard is to be had and do indicate the Use of Acids Juice of Limons Oranges Sorrel  c  I think it may be taken for a general Rule when the Urine is highcolour'd that Acids are proper for they are opposite to that alkalescent State of the Humours and resist the Putrefaction which is the Effect of acrimonious Serum  The Drink should be sparing but forasmuch as the Thirst is sometimes intolerable the Patient may be indulg'd  the free Use of SpawWater and Rhenish Wine  The Aliment should be dry diuretick  See Chap  I Diureticks of the acid Kind are the safest  The Chirurgical Operations for drawing off the Waters are to be left to the Judgment of the Physician  Nothing is more beneficial than strong Frictions of the Skin which attenuate and promote the Circulation of the stagnating Serum  Vomiting in strong Constitutions has prov'd often very effectual for the Concussion of the solid Parts dissolves and dispels the stagnating Humours and even Clysters of proper Ingredients are very beneficial  Violent Purgers by dissolving the Blood have prov'd often pernicious  Many have been cur'd by Abstinence from Drink eating dry Biscuit which creates no Thirst and  strong Frictions four or five times a Day  When the extravasated Serum is evacuated the Diet ought to be such as strengthens the solid Parts allowing Spices and generous Wine and especially the Use of Chalybeat Waters Abstinence from other Sorts of Liquids dry Food and Vegetables astringent Exercise especially Riding and in general such a Diet as generates good Blood  If the Serum stagnates long it turns acrimonious and commonly renders the Patient feverish and thirsty Acid or sour things are the properest both to prevent and cure these Symptoms as they are opposite to that alkaline Putrefaction  Gout  This is a Disease which may affect any membranous Part but commonly those which are at the greatest  Distance from the Heart or the Brain where the Motion of the Fluids is the slowest the Resistance Friction and Stricture of the solid Parts the greatest and the Sensation of Pain by the Obstruction of the small Vessels and Dilaceration of the nervous Fibres extreme  The most common Seat of it is in the Foot its Tendons Nerves Membranes Ligaments and Periostea or Membranes investing the Bones  The most common Causes of it are an hereditary Disposition which operates more strongly in this Disease than in any other a too rich and high Diet and too copious Use of Wine and other spirituous Liquors especially at Supper Excess in some other Pleasures a full gross Habit of Body the too copious use of acid or sour things the Gout being the only Disease in which they are very hurtful to Human Bodies a  sudden chilling of the Feet after Sweat or drying them at the Fire after being wet and cold a sedentary Life with a plentiful Diet and intense Study and Application of the Mind most commonly a Gouty Constitution is attended with great Acuteness of Parts the nervous Fibres both in the Brain and the other Extremities being delicate and there are Instances where Wives have got it from their Husbands by Infection so  Boerhaave  says Females and young People are not subject to this Disease unless where it is hereditary  A proper Regimen of Diet is necessary in this Distemper because it does not admit of very many Helps from Medicines and there are no better Rules than Abstinence from those things which occasion it  It seems to be a Disease of the nervous Parts which makes it so hard to cure Diseases are so as they are more remote in the Thread of the  Motion of the Fluids by the constant and regular Returns of it in some People and their Freedom from it after the Morbid Matter is exhausted it looks as there were regular Accumulations and Gatherings of it as of other Humours in the Body growing perhaps in some People as Corns  As one of the Causes of the Gout is the Suppression of Sweat and Perspiration the procuring a due degree of these seems to be the best Preventive of it if the Feet could be made to sweat in due time it would prevent the Gout which invades in such Constitutions of the Air as suppress Perspiration  Violent Purging in Absence of the Paroxysm by agitating the Humours often hurts and during the Paroxysm may draw the Gout inwardly  The best Diet is Abstinence from acid Substances the moderate use of  such as promote Perspiration as Substances aromatical and volatile Salts which relieve the Gouty as they make the Body perspirable diluent Liquors taken in such a degree as not to hurt the Stomach Moderation in the Quantity of Food and spirituous Liquors Exercise without Fatigue but especially Frictions of the extreme Parts daily and often repeated all possible Methods of making the Feet sweat and much Sleep  In the Paroxysm as temperate and cool and diluent a Diet as the Patient can bear Abstinence from Opiats except when the morbid Matter is separating by Opiats any Irruption goes on better the constant Use of them will hurt keeping the affected Part warm without the Application of Cataplasms ev'n such as are emollient weaken and relax too much and have been sometimes found to distort the Parts  It is of the utmost Importance to know if any Disease proceeds from a Translation of the Gouty Matter for the Methods especially Evacuations us'd in an original Disease would be very improper in a Gouty Case where the Intention must be to draw the Gout down to the Feet by Blisters apply'd to the Thighs or Legs and acrid inflammatory Cataplasms and Plaisters therefore when any Gouty Person is disappointed of a Paroxysm which he expected by the Season or the previous Symptoms and instead of it is seiz'd with another Disease let him speedily consult his Physician  If a Gouty Person can bring himself intirely to a Milk Diet he may so change the whole Juices of his Body as to eradicate the Distemper  The Approach of a Fit of the Gout is easily known by the inward Disorders as Wind Sickness Crudities in the Stomach a Drowsiness  these join'd with the Season or Weather if such a one by a statical Engine could regulate his insensible Perspiration he might often by restoring of that foresee prevent or shorten his Fit  Greensickness Obstructions  The Symptoms of this Disease are evident a due Age of the Patient with an Obstruction of the Menses a Fulness sometimes Pains about the Loins a Laziness Inactivity which is both the Cause and Symptom of the Disease a quick Pulse often emulating that of a hectick Fever Palpitation of the Heart Difficulty of Breathing upon the least Motion a livid Circle about the Eyes Diziness of the Head sometimes an Appetite of odd things as Chalk TobaccoPipes proceeding from an Acidity  in the Stomach a Paleness of the Face and Skin unnatural Haemorrages from the Mouth Nose and other Parts hysterical Symptoms  Young Persons under a womanly Age are often troubled with some of the same Symptoms but not from that Cause and Women obstructed have not always the foremention'd Symptoms in those the Signs of Gravidity and Obstructions are hard to be distinguish'd in the beginning  This Disease is the Parent of many other dangerous Diseases and after six Months hardly to be cur'd  What is to be consider'd in this Case is chiefly if there be a sufficient Fulness or Deficiency of Blood different Methods are to be taken in those two Cases Bleeding which may relieve in the first Case will do hurt in the Second Motion Exercise Frictions Bathings Clysters  Fumigations often repeated are very beneficial  Substances abounding with volatile oily Salts Substances saponaceous aromatical as those Vegetables which abound with a volatile Oil  When there is not a sufficient Plethora a Diet wholesome plentiful and nourishing at the same time strengthening the Organs of Digestion is often effectual  After Relaxing such Substances as strengthen the solid Parts in general are beneficial it is by this Quality that Steel operates so strongly in this Distemper and likewise as being an Antiacid  See  Chap I No  A Woman who by some unusual Haemorrage has that natural Defect supply'd is only to be cur'd by topical Remedies  Diseases of Infants  Infants newborn before they have taken any Aliment often have the whole alimentary Duct filled with a glutinous cheesy Matter and all of them have a Meconium or sort of darkcolour'd Excrement in the Bowels which ought to be purg'd off  Most of the Diseases of suckling Infants proceed from Milk growing sour and curdling in the Stomach the Cure of which is to be effected  First  By attenuating this curdy Matter and  Secondly  by expelling it out of the Body it may be digested by the Infant by Abstinence from Sucking for several Hours Honey and Water with a little Wine attenuate and dissolve and some gentle purging Syrup as Syrup of Cichory with Rhubarb expels the peccant  Matter oily Substances are apt to turn rancid on the Stomachs of Infants Clysters and warm Fomentations and other Applications of aromatical Substances to the Stomach and Belly are useful in this Case  Antiacids especially the Absorbents are more effectual in the Diseases of Infants than in any other  Opiats and anodyne Substances are dangerous  Volatile Salts are hurtful to Infants being too active and operate sometimes as Opiats  Gall is the greatest Resolvent of curdled Milk  Boerhaave  has given at a time one Drop of the Gall of an Eel with Success  Gentle Carminatives as FennelWater MintWater relieve  The Colick green Stools Vomiting Wind and Convulsions all depend upon this Acidity and  when that is rectify'd the Symptoms cease  Diseases of Infants and the Cure of them depend very much upon the Diet of the Nurse  See  Part I Page  When Children begin to feed upon Substances on which Infects deposite their Eggs especially Fruits they are often troubled with Worms for want of a sufficient Force of Digestion to destroy these Eggs  The most common Sort in Children are the round or EarthWorms  The Symptoms occasion'd by the Motion and Biting of these Worms are Loathing as it were from a Feather in the Throat a Vomiting Looseness Fainting a feverish Disposition with a small quick pulse Itching of the Nose Grinding of the Teeth Fits Paleness a craving Appetite Weakness and when the Worms are large they consume the  Moisture and instead of Looseness will occasion Astriction of the Belly with a Swelling Worms will perforate the Guts  Children subject to Worms ought not to live much upon Milk Cheese or ripe Fruits nor take much Sugar some Insects lay their Eggs in Sugar  The Gall of Animals and Mercury kill Worms and destroy their Nests it is found by Experience that the Water in which Mercury is boil'd has this Effect all Bitters among alimentary Substances Honey and Oil given by the Mouth or Clysters have a good Effect they may be taken together fasting any Substance which by its Pungency can wound the Worms will kill them as Steel Hartshorn Coraline Coral powdered Fish Bones  See  Chap I  Above a tenth Part of Infants die in Teething by Symptoms proceeding from the Irritation of the tender nervous Parts of the Jaws occasioning Inflammations Fevers Convulsions Looseness with green Stools not the worst Symptom and in some Gangrenes It is plain that such a Case ought to be treated as any other inflammatory Distemper  When the Symptoms of Teething appear the Gums ought to be relax'd by softening Ointment the Jaws fomented with emollient Decoctions and the whole Head to be kept warm when the Teeth is ready to cut the upper Part rubb'd with hard Substances which Infants by a natural Instinct affect and when there is a manifest Tension of the Gum by the Tooth then it ought to be cut but this Operation ought not to be perform'd too soon  In the Convulsions it is necessary to give volatile Spirits which they can bear better than when they are newborn  The Rickets is another Disease to which Children are subject It has been reckoned a Disease unknown to the Ancients uncommon in hot Countries and more common in  England  than any other Northern Country  Children have this Disease from sickly Parents and especially from Mothers of a weak lax Constitution living on a various high and plentiful Diet without Exercise and Children born healthy often contract the Disease from an unwholsome Nurse  A Diet of farinaceous Substances infermented as of Pudding much Butter wet or illair'd Linen cutaneous Eruptions repell'd or ill cur'd exposing their lower Parts too long  to cold Air may bring or at least increase this Disease  The Disease may be foreseen by the Child's being long in taking to his Feet when it takes place the Child grows lean the muscular Flesh decays and grows flabby the Skin loose and flaccid the Epiphyses of the Bones about the Joints of the Arms grow big the Belly swells the BloodVessels about the Neck enlarge and so does the Head it self the Bones grow crooked these are the outward Appearances the Constitution of the inward Parts is often much worse  It is highly probable that this Disease proceeds from a redundant Acidity because Vinegar will soften and crook tender Bones and this Symptom must happen in Children when there is no Strength in the Muscles to support them or they must be inflected to that Side where the  Muscle pulls strongest Contrary to the common Rules for the Aliment of Children the Diet of those that are Rickety ought to be moderately warm even making use of Spices or carminative Seeds They ought to forbear unfermented farinaceous Substances new Bread and rather use Biscuit Their Diet should be pretty much of flesh Meat such as are commonly call'd White Meats and rather roasted than boil'd such Diet being antiacid They may be allow'd a moderate Quantity of Wine  I knew a rickety Child cur'd by a very great Indulgence of fermented Liquors but it is not an Experiment that I would advise  Frictions of the Backbone and Joints with Flannel smoak'd with penetrating aromatical Substances and fomenting the Joints with old Malaga Wine have prov'd often very effectual  They ought to use as much Exercise as they are capable of but especially by Voiture or Carriage Care must be taken to open the Obstructions in the lower Belly by Vomits and proper Purgations where the Seat of the Disease chiefly lies and after that the Cold Bath is a very proper and effectual Remedy  I have lanch'd out of my Subject under this Head mentioning some medicinal Helps because the Nurses in such Cases are often the Physicians which nevertheless they ought not to be when they can get better Advice  SmallPox  Though I took notice of this Disease in the Article of Feverish Irruptions yet it being one of the most dangerous and universal that infests Mankind I shall add a few  more Rules which may be of use to such as have not the Advice of an able Physician  The greatest and most important Strokes for the Recovery of the Patient must be made at the time of the Invasion or first State of this Disease therefore it is necessary to know the first Symptoms of it many have suffer'd by mistaking it for another Disease  In general young Persons who have not had the Disease ought to be extremely careful to avoid great Irregularities in their Diet because the Smallpox which are occasion'd by such often prove dangerous This Disease is likewise more dangerous as the Fluids are more exalted and dissipated and the Solids more strict and compacted and consequently more so as People are advanc'd in Age  This Disease may be easily communicated by the Contagion or Steams of an infected Person swimming in the Air and drawn in by the Breath or perhaps by the Pores of the Skin and it is evident by Inoculation that the smallest Quantity of the Matter mix'd with the Blood produceth the Disease tho' not so quickly as those volatile Steams  The first Symptoms are a Chilness Rigor succeeded by a Fever and constant Heat a certain Splendor or Shining in the Eyes with a little moisture this is very observable in Children a great Pain in the Head with Dulness Drowsiness Sleepiness a pain in the Back in some but Pains in the Limbs in all Anxiety Inquietude notwithstanding their Drowsiness Loathing Sickness of the Stomach Vomiting and in Infants Convulsions shortly  before the Eruption The Blood let the first time florid after a second time sizy  It is evident that in this State the Disease ought to be treated as any other inflammatory Distemper by such Methods as if it were possible to hinder any Suppuration at all and to resolve and digest as much of the feverish Matter as we can for the longer the Eruption is a coming and the smaller when it comes the Disease is less dangerous therefore all the Methods prractis'd in the beginning of inflammatory Diseases are here necessery with a particular Care of cleansing the alimentary Duct by Vomiting and Clysters the Impurities of which will be carried into the Blood  There is not yet found any particular Antidote to the poisonous Stimulus of this Distemper the learned  Boerhaave  is of opinion  that if any such could be found it must be in Antimony or Mercury intirely destitute of all Acrimony The Effects of Mercury on all Ulcerations are very manifest  Bleeding which is extremely useful in the beginning of the Disease is not so proper and useful when it is advanc'd  In the first Stage the whole Habit of the Body ought to be relax'd a free Perspiration thro' the Skin without violent Sweating promoted the Viscosity or Toughness of the Fluids taken off by diluents the alkalescent State of the Salts corrected all these things are effected by emollient Fomentations apply'd inwardly in Clysters and why not outwardly to the Skin Such are us'd successfully in other Eruptions as Erysipelas Shingles by a slender Diet of Decoctions of farinaceous Vegetables and copious drinking  of cooling Liquors with nitrous and acid Salts and other acid Substances mix'd with them no Flesh unless it be small ChickenBroth no Spice the Air ought not to be spoil'd by Heat nor the Coverings of the Bed so thick as to promote Sweat  The Greatness and Danger of this Disease is estimated by the Quantity of Eruptions on the Face and other Parts of the Head therefore the Matter ought to be solicited by all possible Methods to the lower Parts especially the Legs by Fomentations Bathing Epispasticks Blistering and through the whole Disease keeping the Feet and Legs warm the Breast and Head not any more cover'd than to keep them from the Impression of cold Air  During the Filling and Ripening of the Pustles the Diet may be more plentiful but still not hot or  inflammatory with the due Use of anodyne Substances In this State Demulcents or what abates Acrimony and where the Circumstances of the Patient require it a Spoonful or two of Canary Wine twice or thrice a Day are proper The Diet in this State ought likewise to be adapted to the particular Symptoms of the Disease as cleansing attenuating expectorating to promote the Spitting diuretick when that is suppress'd and Clysters diluent without any Stimulus frequently injected are beneficial in every Stage of the Disease  When the Age Temperament high Pulse and especially a Watchfulness and Delirium all would seem to demand it in any other Case why not Bleeding in this State which I know to have been us'd with great Success a great many Vessels are in this State almost impervious  by the Fluids those who die of this Disease have inward Inflammations especially in the Lungs those Reasons seem to justify Bleeding  Indeed the gangrenous Disposition which appears in the malignant Kind is a Reason against it but hardly any thing will do good in these extremely malignant Cases  In such malignant Kinds all that is left is at last to try evacuating the morbifick Matter by other ways as Epispasticks and Stools procur'd by lenitive Substances not irritating which would only agitate the Humours and increase the Fever  Gravel Stone  A Stone or stony Matter may grow in any Part of a Human Body for when any thing insoluble sticks in any Part of the Body it  gathers a Crust about it a small Drop of concreted Blood may grow to be a Stone for by the Evaporation of the most fluid Parts it grows hard and by the Attraction of new Matter increaseth Blood and a Human Calculus or Stone yield the same Contents by Chymical Trial tho' in an inverse Order  These stony Concretions happen most commonly in the Kidneys and Bladder and indeed if the Tartar and other Contents of the Urine were not constantly voided such Concretions would happen to every Human Creature for the Urine of the most sound Person being inspected with a Microscope after it has stood a while will discover a black Speck which is Sand and wherever this Sand sticks it grows still bigger by the apposition of new Matter When such Concretions  happen in the Kidneys and are expell'd or drop into the Ureters it makes what we call Gravel when they lodge and stick in the Body of the Kidneys and grow to such a Bulk as not to drop into the Pelvis or pass by the Ureters they make the Stone in the Kidneys The Symptoms of which are a dull Pain in the Kidney most commonly bloody Water upon a sudden Jolt violent Motion Pain in Stooping Pain in the Thigh Sickness in the Stomach Colical Pains various Changes in the Colour of the Urine black bloody pale occasion'd by something sharp or scabrous wounding the small BloodVessels if the Stone is smooth and well bedded perhaps this may not happen Fleshy Filaments or Matter voided by Urine are suspicious Symptoms of a Stone in the Kidney especially  if the Patient has been subject to Voiding of Gravel  When a small Stone is lodg'd in the Body of the Kidney it does not create Pain nor much when it falls into the Pelvis but when it falls into the Ureter and sticks the Pain is most acute it often stops at the Flexure and Valve of the Ureter and sometimes in the Urethra or Passage of the Urine from the Bladder while it stays in the Bladder it creates no Pain but remaining there long it grows a confirm'd Stone too big to be pass'd by the Urethra The manner of its Concretion is by concentrical Rings like an Onion about the first Kernel which shews the Cause to be Attraction This is not only true of a small Stone but any solid Body lodg'd in the Bladder will make the Kernel of a Stone the Experiment of a Bullet's producing  this Effect has been try'd upon a Dog and such an Accident has happen'd to a Man by a Wound in which a Bullet has dropt into the Bladder  The Symptoms of a Stone in the Bladder are a Titillation about the Neck of the Bladder and the Parts thereabout a frequent Needing to make Water a Sensation of Weight in the lower Belly under the ShearBone with a great Pain especially upon any sudden Motion which causeth a Concussion of the Bladder a Dribling Difficulty and a momentary Suppression of Urine by the Stone shutting up the Orifice of the Bladder attended with a Tenesmus or needing to go to Stool and a burning Pain in the Urethra sometimes a white Mucus in the Urine tho' this last Symptom will happen without a Stone in the Bladder  The Regimen in the Stone in the Kidneys is by diluent and soft Diureticks to try to expel it if it is small enough to pass if the Stone is brittle it will often crumble and pass in the Form of Gravel if the Stone is too big to pass the best Method is to come to a sort of a Composition or Truce with it the Diet ought to be cool and diluent as far as possible to hinder its Growth to use Diureticks that gently resolve as Parsley Fennel Scorzonera Sassafras Mallows and Tea Dandelion Cichory Oats Barley Honey Honey and Vinegar Nitrous Salts as Spirit of dulcify'd Nitre the most soft cooling Diluent of all is Whey the best Emollients are Decoctions of Marshmallows LinseedTea  Bathing in tepid Water Clysters seasoning the Aliment moderately with SeaSalt for the immoderate  Use of it is resolving and diuretick the Belly in all Cases of the Stone ought to be kept lax and open  In a confirm'd Stone of the Kidneys too violent Exercise is dangerous  During the passing of a Stone one should avoid at first all strong Stimulating relaxing and lubricating the Passages and quieting the Spasms by Opiats is certainly the best Method and where Bathing cannot be conveniently had OxBladders half full of warm Water apply'd constantly to the affected Part may be usefully substituted Letting of Blood taketh off a Tension better than any thing and is very necessary where the Symptoms are violent when the Parts are sufficiently relax'd stimulating Diureticks may be us'd more safely especially if associated with Opiats  As to Dissolvents of the Stone all that have hitherto been propos'd are chimerical  Helmont  talks of Bulls Blood Goats Blood is rather a better Dissolvent  The surest way to hinder the Generation of a Stone is to procure a Diarrhoea by Whey Broth and a liquid Diet and indeed what would not one do to prevent so painful a Disease  When the Stone is fallen to the Bladder Care should be taken to make it pass as soon as possible for the Reasons abovemention'd if all the Symptoms abate without the passing of the Stone it is not certain that the Stone remains in the Bladder because a very small Stone may pass insensibly by Urine if the Stone has pass'd it is not certain that the Fit is over for there are often more and the usual Remedies ought not to be left off  The Irritations of the Membranes of the Bladder by a Stone may be much mitigated by the Injection of the Oil of Linseed or Almonds into the Bladder  Such as are subject to the Gravel or Stone ought to be careful of their Diet to use such Aliments as generate a small Quantity of Foeces or relax the Belly Aliment demulcent as Pease a Decoction of ChickPease is a Remedy in a Fit of the Stone they ought to drink Whey in the Spring and take Honey in several Forms if it agrees with them Rice Barley Millet are all good in this Case nothing makes Stones or Gravel pass more easily than Opiats  If the Stone sticks in the Urethra emollient Fomentation of the Parts Oil injected or in case of great Extremity an Instrument with a Cavity like a small Spoon  dipt in Oil may fetch out the Stone  The Stone in the Bladder is not only a painful but a mortal Disease if not extracted The Diet of a Patient in such a Case is such as of a wounded Person nourishing without Acrimony  Let the Reader look into the Article of Inflammations of the Kidneys where there are some Directions proper for all who are subject to the Stone or Gravel  Rheumatism  The Disease seems to be an inflammatory Disposition in the serous Part of the Blood affecting the lymphatick Arteries and therefore affecting those Parts where the Vessels are the narrowest The Blood as in other inflammatory Cases is sizy the alkalescent Salts in the Serum  producing coreaceous Concre  ons  The common Methods us'd in this Case are certainly proper these are repeated Bleedings and Purges interposing Anodynes and gentle Sudorisicks and Blisters when the Pain is obstinate in one Part  As for the Diet it ought to be cool diluting and chiefly Vegetable  If there be a specifick in Aliment is certainly Whey I knew a Person subject to this Disease who could never be cur'd by any other Method but a Diet of Whey and Bread A Milk Diet is likewise effectual for changing that saline Constitution of the Serum of the Blood  Cream of Tartar in WaterGruel taken for several Days will abate the Pains and Swellings considerably by its Acidity correcting the alkalescent Salts in the Blood  In obstinate Sciatical Pains Blistering and Cauteries have been found effectual and the most penetrating Medicines especially the ethereal Oil of Turpentine mix'd with Honey  I have lanch'd out of my Subject in this Article because of many common People who cannot always have good Advice  FINIS  ERRATA  Page Line  for  Apoponox  read  Apoponax  Page Line  for
