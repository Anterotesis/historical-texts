have been originally a native of the EastIndies and from thence introduced into the Eu∣ropean seas at present it may be considered with propriety as a naturalized British species and it is a fortunate circumstance that it does not thrive so well with us as in warmer climates  The animal a soft and almost shapeless gelatinous body is fur∣nished with a calcareous process or augur at the head with which it bores with the utmost facility into the stoutest oaken plank as it lies in the water and where a number of them attack the same piece of wood will in a few days entirely destroy it hence the ravages of these animals in the bottoms of ships are fraught with the greatest danger and notwithstanding all the precaution of sheathing the bottoms of ships with copper they insinuate themselves through the smallest cavities and lodge themselves securely in the timbers Where the work of the animal first commences the shell is obtusely rounded and closed and as it proceeds it continues to lengthen its shell till as Gmelin says it becomes from four to six inches in lengthwe have seen one of them whose progress through the solid plank had not been interrupted that had grown nearly to the length of eighteen inches It is said that sheets of paper dipped in tar and applied to the ship's bottom will prove a more effectual preservative  of the timber than the usual sheathing of copper and an extensive manufactory has been of late established for the preparation of this article how far it may prove ultimately successful we cannot pre∣sume to imagine but perhaps both the paper and the copper might be employed together with greater advantage than either of those articles separately  For a more complete history of the Teredo than we might have otherwise possessed we are indebted to a remarkable circumstance that occurred about sixty years since the piles on the coast of Hol∣land were found to be injured to a very alarming degree by the ravages of this creature and beside several other ingenious tracts upon their history and the calamity they had occasioned  Sellius  published an account of it under the title of Historia Naturalis Teredines seu Xylophagi Marini in in this book the anatomy of the animal is illustrated with Plates and upon the whole his observations deserve the attention of the curious reader Another account was also written by  Baster  and published in the Trans∣actions of the Royal Society of London in vol as quoted above  In our specimens the apertures or mouths of the shells are very perfect and exhibit the same appearance as  Kaemmer  and  Gmelin  seem to think peculiar to the species  Utriculus  namely an oval aperture divided by a partition in the middle The shell is extremely delicate or thin and very brittle  PLATE CXLVI PATELLA INTORTA

admitted among the testaceous produc∣tions of our seas by Borlase Pennant and Da Costa and this we must confess is the best apology we have to offer for inserting it in the present Work  PLATE CXLIX

compressed with thick elevated obtuse concentric striae and slightly truncated anteriorly  VENUS LACTEA testa lentiformi subcompressa striis concentricis crassis elevatis obtusis antrorsum subtruncata  This appears to be a new and undescribed British species of Venus approaching in some particulars to others of the same genus found on our coast although differing in having the concentric striae or ridges large elevated and obtusely rounded The striae for ex∣ample in V borealis and V cancellata rise in a thin membranaceous ridge to an acute edge and the former of these seems at first sight to bear a strong analogy to our shell Venus lactea is also a much thicker and heavier shell than any other resembling it with which we are acquainted V Exoleta has thick but minute striae  Our present

Duchess of Portland He says it was found adhering to the leaves of the  Iris Pseudacorus  in waters near Beaconsfield in Buckingham∣shire by Mr Agneu the Duchess of Portland's Gardener It has been since found on plants in the river Stour by the Rev Thomas Rackett  It is evidently distinct from the  Patella lacustris  of Linnaeus in being of an oblong instead of ovate form and in having the pointed vertex bending obliquely or to one side instead of being centrical and reflected back The colour is variable in some it is greenish and in others of a pale brown It is represented on our plate

bottoms of trees among the moss in woods and wet shady places It is glossy very thin  brittle and of a brown horny colour When the animal is alive in the shell it is of a dark red colour approaching to black and is very elegantly set all over with minute short white bristles or hairs which easily rub or fall off when the animal dies  In the plate the upper and underside are represented together

very common both in this country and other parts of Europe When full grown this shell is three quarters of an inch in breadth and onethird of its breadth in height the spires flat the outermost wreath very convex beneath with a large and deep central umbilicus and circular mouth or aperture  The young shells are quite plain and of a horny colour or whitish and semitransparent When full grown they are opake dull white or yellowish and usually fasciated with one or more brown circular bands according to the involutions of the wreaths The order size and number of these brown bands as Da Costa says vary extremely though commonly there is one band in the middle or near the bottom of each wreath and often other fainter and narrower bands accom∣pany it Gmelin speaks of five distinct varieties which differ in size in colour and number of the bands Sometimes they are quite white or marked with a single spiral band and sometimes these bands amount to eight or nine on each shell  Dead shells of this kind are found in vast numbers intermixed with the sand on heaths and are always observed in great plenty with the others  PLATE CLII PINNA LAEVIS  SMOOTH PINNA OR HAM SHELL  GENERIC CHARACTER

horncolour smooth valves rugose on the posterior part  PINNA LAEVIS testa subtriangulari cornea laevi valvis posterius rugosis  This species of Pinna which differs from any that has been before described as a British shell and if we are not mistaken from either of the Linnaean or Gmelinian species of the genus also was received by A M'Leay Esq among other curious shells that were dredged up on the coast of Shetland  The difference between this and the other analogous kinds seems to consist in its being of a more triangular form and in not having  the least trace of spines or murication from the beak descend some very obsolete longitudinal striae but the surface is in general perfectly smooth and glossy notwithstanding the specimen before us has at first sight a rugged aspect the shell having been greatly bruised or mutilated in its growth and afterwards uncouthly repaired by the ani∣mal inhabitant  PLATE CLIII SOLEN PELLUCIDUS  PELLUCID RAZOR SHELL  GENERIC CHARACTER  Bivalve

we have no other authority for believing it to be an inhabitant of our own seas than that of Mr Agneu gardener to the late dutchess of Portland by whom it was discovered among the Orkney Islands and in consequence admitted into the collection of British shells in the Portland Museum  One of the most striking characters of this shell is a single cari∣nated ridge that surrounds the first or largest wreath of the shell and does not afterwards appear on either of the rest This it may be proper to notice since the circumstance has been strictly mentioned both by Linnaeus Fabricius  Faun Groen  and Chemitz but it is not certainly a constant criterion of the species there was a variety of this kind in the collection of the late Dr Fordyce at present in that of the Earl of Tankerville in which the carinated ridge distinctly traverses the whole shell in a spiral course from the first wreath nearly to the apexThe latter was from Newfoundland  PLATE CLV  FIG I I TROCHUS CONICUS  CONIC TROCHUS OR

notwithstanding perfectly distinct as a British shell we believe it is altogether new nor does it seem to be described by any foreign author Four of these shells were picked up on the sea coast of Devonshire by J Laskey Esq from whom we received the specimens represented in our Plate It has been since communicated also from the Mediterranean sea  FIG II II TROCHUS CINEREUS  ASHEN TOP SHELL

specimen at present in our possession the only inducement we have for in∣serting it for though this writer observes that it is a common shell on several of our coasts we must acknowledge it has never occurred to us as a British shell Exotic specimens we have but these are said to have been brought from the South Seas Da Costa we have a strong suspicion was mistaken concerning this shell his reference to Lister is correct the rest of his synonyms namely those of  Dale Wallis  c are erroneous since those writers meant a very different shell The following is the minute description Da Costa gives of this kind  "The shell is thick and strong of the size of a cherry shape obtusely pyramidal or not quite tapering to a point  "The base is very concave with some circular furrows the mouth roundish and capacious  within  fine motherofpearl the  outer lip  smooth and even the inner of  pillar lip  has two jags or slight teeth and two furrows crossing it transversely from hence it widens runs oblique and forms a spacious cavity at the bottom of which lies the  umbilicus  deep cylindric and so hollow as to admit the head of a large pin All this part is of a dark ash greatly variegated with blackish lines or streaks which run lengthways and across but the beginning of the umbilicus is generally pearly and of a fine light greenish colour  "The body and turban have five bellied or swelled wreaths or whorls separated by a very depressed line they are circularly striat∣ed but faintly and the colours are exactly the same as at the base"  PLATE CLVI MUREX ANGULATUS  ANGULATED MUREX

near shell of interesting figure that has been found though rarely on the English coasts The specimens figured in our Plate were discovered on the sands at Brighton by Mr Munn who kindly communicated them to us We have received it since from the coast of Weymouth  This is doubtless an undescribed species  PLATE CLVII  FIG I I HELIX RUFESCENS  REDDISH SNAIL  GENERIC CHARACTER  Animal Limax Shell

slight carene or ridge that surrounds the first or largest wreath of the shell The colour as the name implies is reddish when the animal is alive when dead whitish and discoloured the carene is usually of a lighter colour than the rest of the shell  Da Costa speaks of it as being not very common observing at the same time that he had received it from Cornwall and Hampshire It is pretty frequent he adds about Leeswood in Flintshire between the bark and wood of trees thrown down and decayed especially alders Dr Lister found it in plenty about Tadcaster in the woods and hedges of marshy and shady meadows and in like places throughout Craven in Yorkshire he observes there is a variety if not a different species in Kent somewhat larger lighter coloured and with a smaller um∣bilicus Mr Morton found it at Morsley and the other Northamp∣tonshire woods To this we should add that from our own obser∣vation the species appears to be more frequent in many parts of the country than our author imagined It delights chiefly in marshy places Occasionally we have found it on aquatic plants in Battersea meadows  FIG II HELIX PALLIDA  PALE SNAIL  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Shell inflated

liberal communication of British shells col∣lected by herself we have had such frequent occasion to mention in the progress of this publication has obliged us with a small specimen of the Arca Noae found on the shores of Cornwall the smallest shell figured in the upper part of our Plate  It has been presumed before that this shell was a native of our coasts that Borlase had met with it and that the Arca tortuosa  No Penn Brit Zool  of Pennant which he says inhabits Cornwall and has been found near Weymouth was no other than the Arca Noae of Linnaeus But this still remained a matter of much uncertainty among Conchologists and with ourselves till we received the specimen from the lady above∣mentioned which proves beyond dispute that it is a British shell and perfectly similar to those of the same species found in the Medi∣terranean sea This being a young shell is not of course covered with the rude brown epidermis as in the old or full grown Mediter∣ranean shell figured with it in order to elucidate the species with more precision Since the publication of the Plate we have also had the satisfaction of receiving another specimen of the shell nearly thrice the size of the small one figured in a parcel of shells col∣lected on Slapton sands Devonshire last summer  At the same time that Miss Pocock discovered this small specimen of Arca Noae several worn valves of an Arca confessedly of a dif∣ferent kind occurred likewise Both the internal and external view of these are represented in the lower part of the plate fig together with that of the perfect specimen of a foreign shell fig which may prove hereafter to be of the same species The mutilated valves we have little hesitation in believing it to be precisely those of the shell figured by Lister  t    n    Balanus Bellonij tenuiter striata  though from their imperfect condition it might be improper to offer any positive opinion concerning them At a future period we may be enabled by receiving better specimens to ascertain this point and as it may then appear our conjectures were not unfounded  We should further add that this species though observed by Lister has been overlooked by Linnaeus and that from a MS note in one of the copies of Lister's work in the library of Sir Joseph Banks we find the late Dr Solander intended to have named it specifically  fusca  had he lived to publish his new arrangement of Conchology  PLATE CLIX TURBO RETICULATUS  RETICULATED TURBO  GENERIC CHARACTER  Animal Limax Univalve spiral or of a taper form Aperture somewhat compressed orbicular entire  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Shell tapering reticulated with granules testaceous whorl reversed aperture straitened  TURBO RETICULATES testa turrita reticulata granulata testacea anfractibus coarctata  This is a remarkably neat or rather elegant shell and equally distinguished for its rarity It was found in the sands on the coast of Cornwall by Miss Pocock to whose polite attention we are ex∣clusively indebted for the specimen now figured  That this small species of Turbo is undescribed either as a British or a foreign shell we have little reason to dispute unless the follow∣ing described by Mr Walker should prove to be the same "Turbo Turritus perversus novem anfractibus punctatis apertura coarctata the reversed taper Turbo of nine dotted whorls and straitened aperture  A shell found at Sandwich"The description does not strictly cor∣respond with our shell the figure is yet more remote Some degree of ambiguity arises from this particular circumstance in our shell the wreaths are uniformly lineated spirally with three prominent rows of tubercles or more correctly speaking granulations except on the first wreath where they are more numerous and the interme∣diate series on every wreath consists of smaller granulations than those on either side of it The term  punctatis  on the contrary which Mr Walker has adopted must rather imply a dot depressed in the engraving also by which his description is elucidated the dots appear to be disposed in three distinct series upon each wreath as the granulations are in the shell before us but each dot is apparently depressed and situated in the center of a quadrangular compartment at the same time also it must be remarked that the intermediate series of these dots on every wreath are of an equal magnitude with the others The aperture whatever might be the shell designed is mise∣rably expressed as are indeed the figures both of the natural size and magnified We suspect upon the whole they are intended for our shell and were it not for the objections stated should insert a re∣ference to his figure plate No as a synonym  PLATE CLX LEPAS BOREALIS  NORTHERN ACORN SHELL  GENERIC CHARACTER  Animal Triton Shell affixed at

the Warspight ship of war when taken into dock to be repaired after lying in the harbour of Portsmouth for a great length of time Mr James Hay of Portsmouth has since found two or three shells of the same kind by dredging in Portsmouth harbour so that though probably not indigenous it has now become a na∣turalised species  This was first communicated by J Laskey Esq We have since received it from Newfoundland affixed to the valve of  a northern  ostrea  and learning that it is undoubtedly a native of the north seas we venture to assign it the specific name of  borealis  The clusters of these shells when pressed together which rarely happens take an elongated form as is expressed in the upper figure We are certainly to consider this as a rare species  PLATE CLXI MACTRA RADIATA  RADIATED

other similar occasions in the progress of this work Miss Pocock several shells of this kind were found by her on the sandy coasts of Cornwall near Lelant in the year  It remains to express some little doubt whether every circumstance will allow us to consider this as an hitherto undescribed species as a British shell we can have no hesitation in saying it has not been mentioned by any author We were rather inclined at first to think our shell could be no other than a variety of the Dentalium striatulum of Gmelin which is described as a native of the Mediterranean and Sicilian seas The synonyms given by Gmelin to that species we found however to be less expressive of our shell than his de∣scription Lister's shell to which he refers  t    f    b  is much larger than our shell as is likewise that of Martini quoted with it both are described to be of a fine green colour with the tip only white but it has uniformly eight distinct ribs or angles as in our shell which is a much more important characteristic of a species than the mere difference of colourThere is another shell figured by  Martini pl    f    B  that seems to approach much nearer to our shell and the colour is white but as in D elephantium this has ten ribs instead of eight it is the Dentalium aprinum of Gmelin As our shell upon the whole does not strictly accord with those species noticed nor any others which we are acquainted with a new name and character will tend at least to obviate confusion Of Den∣talium striatulum it may prove to be a variety but that is doubtful and there is scarcely any reason to dispute its being undescribed unless it be of that species  PATE CLXIII TELLINA DEPRESSA  DEPRESSED TELLEN  GENERIC CHARACTER  The hinge usually furnished with three teeth Shell generally sloping on

Pem∣brokeshire where they had been apparently thrown up by a violent sea that had raged with considerable fury two or three hours before This shell we conceived to be an undescribed British shell but have since found that it had been observed on the north shore of Poole at Weymouth sparingly by Dr Pultney and described by him in  Hutchin's History of Dorsetshire under the specific name of  Squalida  This conchologist admit it to be Tellina squalida of Solander  Mus Port  and Tellina depressa of Gmelin  The only synonym given by Gmelin for his  T depressa  whose  habitat  he is even unacquainted with is a reference to Gualtieri f H I L The two first are small and perhaps not of the same species those represented at letter L and M we believe to be the true shell of which we offer a figure as the Tellina depressa of Gmelin Gualtieri thus describes his shell "Tellina inaequilatera satis depressa minutissime striata vel candida vel purpurascens vel subrosea"  The figures in the annexed plate represent the natural size of our largest specimens the colours are variable more or less of a fine pale orange yellow and tinged with rosy It is certainly rare  PLATE CLXIV LEPAS DILATA

Lepas is that given by the late Mr Ellis in his Natural History of Zoophytes In addition to the character he assigns to this shell quoted as a synonym this writer acquaints us only that it is "from St George's Channel" We have never met with it either on the coast of that  channel or any other nor have we received it from any of our friends at the same time that we have no reason to distrust the information of that author and only infer from the attention we have by chance bestowed particularly to the marine productions of that sea that it must be rare  A specimen of this shell one which we are inclined to think on pretty good authority to be the same or one of them at least that was sent by the late Mr Ellis to the Dutchess of Portland is at this time in our Cabinet the late Dr Fordyce became first possessed of this specimen and at his death we obtained it under the title of Lepas sigillatum of Solander Unlike Lepas anatifera or anserifera the valves of this shell are uncommonly thin brittle in a certain degree corneous with the largest lateral valves rather crumpled in the usual course of the striae and marked transversely with obsolete rays the shell is likewise covered with a fine pale brown skin or epidermis is larger than anatifera and has a singular acute promi∣nent dilation at the base of the back valve  PLATE CLXV VOLUTA LAEVIS  SMOOTH VOLUTE  GENERIC CHARACTER

Mus Portl  As a British species this extremely rare little shell was first noticed on the coast of Weymouth being dredged up in deep water by some fishermen and consigned to the cabinet of the late Dutchess of Portland The specimens we have figured are two of those originally in the possession of her Grace  Dr Solander who it is well known to the scientific conchologist intended to have published a catalogue of that Museum it appears on a reference to his posthumous papers called this species edentula a name which without detracting from the merit of that able naturalist it must be allowed is by no means applicable So far from its being destitute of teeth the series of denticulations are sufficiently visible on the  columella  those on the lip are yet more prominent and can by no means justify the appellation of edentula  Voluta Laevis for such we have presumed to name this shell is remarkably glossy free in a perfect degree from any kind of striae whitish and most delicately tinged with pale blushes of red and yellowish or straw colourIt has much the habit of a cypraea and might without any impropriety be arranged under that genus  PLATE CLXVI  FIG I LEPAS

through the collections of the late Dutchess of Portland and Dr Fordyce is at present in our possession  There are several interesting remarks upon this singular genus in a paper written by the late Mr John Ellis which is inserted in the transactions of the Royal Society for the year the letter is addressed to Mr Isaac Romilly a member of the society and con∣tains in particular the following observation upon  Lepas Scal∣pellum  "Fig " he says referring to his illustrative plate "is the next animal of this class this is not yet described I found several of them sticking to the warted Norway Sea Fan which Dr Pantop∣pidan the Bishop of North Bergen sent you from its appearance I have called it the Norway Sea Fan Penknife The stem of this is covered with little testaceous scales The upper part of the animal is enclosed in thirteen distinct shells six on each side besides the hingeshell which is common to both sides these are connected together by a membrane that lines the whole

NERITA INTRICATA testa laevi spira submucronata umbilico magno subcordato lobo parvo carinato  NERITA CANRENA  var  That this shell is not the young of Nerita Glaucina as some have suspected is evident from the depth and structure of the umbilicus which in the former is almost completely closed by the pillar lip It is rather allied to Nerita Canrena which has a gibbous bifid umbi∣licus and may possibly indeed prove to be nothing more than a va∣riety  of that shell The varieties of N Canrena enumerated by Gmelin amount to twentyfive neither of which accords exactly with our shell and that writer describes them only as natives of India Africa and America but it is not unlikely it may be also an European shell  Our specimens are from Weymouth  PLATE CLXVIII  FIG I HELIX PUTRIS  MUD

particular we think he must be mistaken The figure given by Gualtieri is the only one referred to by Linnaeus in the Systema Naturae for Putris and that is most exactly the same as our shell although the design is taken from a minute specimen Pennant's Helix Putris t f is apparently the H limosa Both the species in question are well figured by Chemnitz on the same plate  This shell is very common in ditches ponds and other watery places and especially in those overgrown with weeds  FIG II HELIX BULLAOIDES  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Shell ovate smooth glossy horny brittle whorls reversed spire short

in the posterior part of the lip of this shell is singular By this mark the species may be immediately distin∣guished in a collection of British Shells being perhaps the only one of the kind found on our coast This notch it should however be added is to be considered rather as the distinctive feature of a natural family of shells than as the character of the individual species now before us the very same appearance being observable on several of the extraeuropean shells of the Murex Genus  Our specimens of this scarce and as we believe undescribed species were found on the western coast  PLATE CLXX VENUS FASCIATA  FASCIATED VENUS SHELL  GENERIC CHARACTER  Hinge furnished with three teeth two near each other the third divergent from the beaks  SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS  Shell

observed it sparingly distributed on the sands near Tenby in Pembrokeshire Da Costa says he was informed that it is found near Bangor among the rocks from Bangor Ferry to Anglesea in  Wales by which he could only mean that the species is an inhabitant of the Menai the arm of Beaumaris bay communicating with the St George's channel which divides Caernarvonshire from the island of Anglesea The same writer notes it likewise from Cornwall Dr Pultney describes it as a scarce shell which he had found at Wey∣mouth  Having Da Costa's specimens of this shell and also that of his Pectunculus Vetula before us we should not refrain from observing that the opinion of Dr Pultney respecting these shells is incorrect they are not merely transitions in growth or varieties of the same kind the difference between the two is obvious and fully authorize us to consider them as distinct species It should be understood in ad∣vancing this remark that the shell which Da Costa figures and de∣scribes for Pectunculus Vetula is clearly the Linnaean Venus Paphia a shell well known as a native of the West Indies and never found to our knowledge in any of the European seas Da Costa was aware after his work had been published that he had erroneously con∣founded the variety of Fasciatus Fig in our Plate with the West Indian shell he had conceived the latter to be the same shell in a more perfect condition and caused it to be engraved accordingly  Dr Pultney in the passage wherein these shells of Da Costa are noticed in his catalogue of the shells found on the coast of Dorset∣shire describes the Pectunculus Fasciatus as nothing more than a variety of Venus Paphia  Linn  in which respect he is assuredly mistaken One of the most striking characters by means of which the two species are to be discriminated in our opinion may be ob∣served in the structure of the concentric ridges on the outside of the shell these in the true Linnaean Paphia are remarkably thick and  prominent in the middle but in approaching each extremity become suddenly obtuse and are then continued in an attenuated ridge par∣ticularly as they extend towards the front of the shell and thus exactly corresponding with the definition of Linnaeus "rugis incrassatis pube rugis attenuatis" On the contrary in our shell the ridges are nearly of an uniform thickness throughout sloping gradually with the depression of the shell behind and only terminating abruptly at the edge of the front or fore part of the shell where the valves appear obtuse the outline of the shell is also very different from Venus Paphia the latter being more produced on each side than our Venus Fasciata  PLATE CLXXI PATELLA MILITARIS  HOOKED LIMPET  GENERIC CHARACTER  Animal a Limax shell univalve subconic without spire  SPECIFIC

rarely met with on the British coast We have it from Cornwall through the favour of Miss Pocock and lately from Devonshire Dr Pultney acquaints us that Mr Bryer found this species on the sands near Weymouth Castle Dorsetshire  Gmelin in his edition of the  Systema Naturae  neglects to insert this species for what reason we are at a loss to conceive The specimens we possess of this rare shell from the warmer parts of Europe are larger than those found on our coast In different specimens we observe that the striae are liable to vary both in form and number some shells appearing much more strongly reticulated than others  PLATE CLXXII TURBO SUBULATUS  SUBULATE WREATH SHELL  GENERIC CHARACTER  Animal Limax Shell univalve spiral or of a taper form Aperture somewhat compressed orbicular

same as that now before us but the extensive list of references to other works added by that writer we are induced to reject as being at least in many respects ambiguous Our specimens of this shell

the rarer shells of this country on very slight authority namely that of a friend who believes he once saw a few specimens of this  Murex  that were fished up in the sea at a short distance to the north of the OrkniesOn this suspicion only we  could not have presumed to insert the species in this work were it not to avail ourselves of the opportunity afforded by that means to cor∣rect an error very generally admitted concerning the true Murex despectus of Linnaeus the shell at this time under consideration  To the English conchologist it need be scarcely said that another shell somewhat similar to the present although specifically different has been hitherto received as the Murex despectus of Linnaeus by every writer in this country who has had occasion to speak of that shell The origin of this mistake it will be perceived from the following particulars rests in a great measure if not entirely with Linnaeus himself The Murex despectus of this writer is noticed for the first time in the account of his Travels through part of Sweden a small octavo volume written in the Swedish language with notes relative to Natural History in Latin At page he describes this shell in these words "cochlea spiris octo oblonga utrinque producta lineis duabus elevatis" referring to plate fig of the same work for a delineation of the shell the figure quoted in every respect agrees with our specimen not only in the general outline but most exactly in having the slight carinated ridges that pass spirally round the whorls a character not observable on the Murex despectus of English authors So far therefore we are convinced that the present shell is the Murex despectus of the Linnaean  Iter Westrogothicum  The work above mentioned appeared in the year in which Linnaeus likewise published the first edition of his  Fauna Suecica  In the latter Murex despectus is again described with a reference to his  Iter W goth  and in addition to that synonym a shell figured by Lister is also quoted for the same species This is the source of that very confusion which has since arisen concerning the Linnaean  Despectus and should be fully stated  Lister's Angl t    f  is the reference given by Linnaeus Adverting to this we find the fol∣lowing definition of the shell given by Lister "Buccinum album laeve maximum septem spirarum"He further adds in the general description "Testae pars exterior ex tota laevis est i e sine striis quamvis saepius vel rugis quibusdam vel aliis rebus extrinsecus adna∣tis exasperetur" From this account and from the figure he has given of the shell there is not the smallest reason to dispute that Lister means the shell which English writers have heretofore con∣sidered as the Murex Despectus  In Lister's Plate the shell is reversed by mistake most likely of the engraver  but it is not less certain that Linnaeus was wrong in quoting Lister's figure for his Swedish shell since they are not the same However on the authority of this reference to Lister which afterwards appeared in the Systema Naturae this shell has continnued to be considered as the species meant by Linnaeus  Nor was this the only oversight which appears to have been com∣mitted by that eminent Naturalist by continuing to refer in the Systema Naturae to Lister's figure for his species Despectus no one scarcely could imagine that Lister's shell should be the M Antiquus of Linnaeus instead of his Despectus and yet we are persuaded after attentively comparing his description of the shells with his synonyms that such is the fact the description agrees with it and the figure given by  Gualteri  is surely of the same kind as that which Lister speaks of  The Linnaean shell M Despectus is well described and the figure in his  Iter W Goth  is expressive the two elevated spiral lines together with the rotundity of the wreaths are strikingly  characteristic of this species At the first glance this shell appears to be an intermediate kind between Lister's shell and the Murex Carinatus of Pennant and ourselves indeed the principal difference we perceive between the true M Despectus and Lister's shell is that the former has the whorls of the spire rather more ventricose and distinctly marked with two slightly elevated spiral lines from Murex Carinatus it differs principally in the very prominent angulations of the  anfrac∣tibus  where the ridges appear and more particularly in the strong depression between the upper ridge and the suture of the whorls  The Murex despectus at pesent under consideration is certainly very rare except in the North of Europe where we are led to suppose from what Linnaeus says it is not uncommon  The only specimens we have ever seen of this kind are from Greenland  HAVING thus ascertained as we may reasonably believe the true Linnaean Murex Despectus it remains in this place to propose the following emendations and additions to the description of two Shells figured in the course of this work namely Murex Despectus Plate
