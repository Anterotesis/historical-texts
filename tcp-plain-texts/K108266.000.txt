 EXTRACT OF A LETTER TO A GENTLEMAN IN MARYLAND Wherein is demonstrated the extreme wickedness of tolerating the  Slave Trade  in order to  avour the  illegalities  of our Colonies where the  Two First Foundations of English Law  Two Wit∣nesses of God are supplanted by opposite and of course  illegal  ordinances which occasions a  Civil Death of the English Constitution  so that these  Two Witnesses  may be said to  lie dead  in all the West India Islands  LONDON  PRINTED BY JAMES PHILLIPS GEORGE YARD LOMBARD STREET MDCCXCIII  EXTRACT OF A LETTER c  A Remark which I made many years ago respecting the  illegality  of taking up  Slaves that had escaped from their masters  had been useful I was informed to some friends of humanity in America in their endeavours to protect those poor oppressed people I cannot now find a copy of that paper but the argument was chiefly built on a reference to a text in Deut ch xxiii v  Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee He shall dwell with thee even among you in the place  WHICH HE SHALL CHOOSE  manifestly  as  a freeman    in one of thy  GATES  where  IT LIKETH HIM BEST  thou shalt not oppress him  This I observed was no part of the abrogated  ceremonial  law of the Jews but manifestly a  moral law  because the reason of it still remainsso that it must be of indispensible obligation as long as the hateful  oppressions  of Slaveholders afford us any occasions of exercising this  duty  to  God  of  pro∣tecting the Slaves that escape from their masters  and consequently I asserted that any  colonial law  which opposes this  ordinance of God  by ordering the arresting and delivering up runaway Slaves or which in any way tends to deprive them of due legal protection is of course to be deemed a  corruption null  and  void  in itself as being contrary to the second foundation of English law This necessary consequence I urged from a well known  maxim  of the English law respecting  Statutes  acts of Assembly or acts of Parliament  nec contra  RATIONEM  nec contra  LEGEM DIVINAM"  statuta existunt  Doct et Stud c p b That  Statutes exist not against  REASON nor against the DIVINE LAW" and that  "an unjust law  is NOT LAW  "Lex injusta non est lex"  Prin Leg et Aequit And again that  these two laws  viz the Law of Reason and the Law Divine  "cannot abate or turn aside"    Hae duae Leges declinari non possunt  Doct et Stud c p  But I have since had occasion to regard these two fundamental laws of the English constitution with still more awful attention and therefore I must farther remark that the first foundation  the law of  REASON as including all the  laws of na∣ture  justice and natural right  is certainly to be deemed  the law of God  as well as the  second foun∣dation  the divine precepts in the Holy Scriptures because the former is defined by high legal autho∣rity to be  "the law written upon the heart of man"  and of course is the law of nature which  cannot  therefore be obliterated nor changed by time or place but ought every where  and among  all men  to  be maintained because  THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE IMMUTABLE""  Lex rationis in corde scribitur  ideo deleri non potest nec etiam recipit mutationem ex loco nec tempore sed ubique et inter omnes homines servari debet Nam JURA NATURALIA IMMUTABILIA SUNT Et ratio immutationis est quod recipiunt naturam rei pro fundamento quae semper eadem est et ubique  Doct et Stud c p This amply demon∣strates the propriety of declaring  the law of Reason  to be the  first foundation  of English law as being  "the law of God written"  as it were  on the heart of man  It is that  knowledge of good and evil  in man  which may fairly be deemed a participation of  "the Divine Wisdom"  or of Christ himself that  true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world  John i and of course renders every man obnoxious through the knowledge of right and law to the divine vengeance for disobedience Our first pa∣rents  wilfully  assumed this knowledge contrary to an express command of their Creator being de∣luded by the spiritual enemy and thereby entailed  death  and  condemnation  on all their posterity laying them under an absolute necessity to obtain  redemp∣tion  by a still farther participation of the same  "Divine Wisdom"  or  "Word of God"  There is also another legal term or title for this  first foundation of law  viz  the eternal law  which in our books is properly defined to mean exactly the same authority as  the law of reason  i e  the supreme reason of  DIVINE  WISDOM  by which  GOD WILLS  that all things created by him be moved and directed to a good and proper end  LEX AETERNA  nihil aliud est quam ipsa  SUMMA RATIO GUBERNATIONIS RERUM IN DEO  sive illa summa ratio  DIVINAE SAPIENTIAE  qua vult  DEUS  omnia a se condita moveri et dirigi ad bonum et debitum finem  c Doct et Stud c p and again  The  LAW ETERNAL  under another description is called a perpetual and constant  WILL  to give to every one his  RIGHT  Lex Aeterna sub alia des∣criptione dicitur perpetua et constans  VOLUNTAS JUS SUUM UNICUIQUE TRIBUENS  ibid Here then we find an immoveable foundation of  justice  of  right  of  the rights of man  of  righteous∣ness  of  the law of nature  c for all these terms are parallel or of the same import and are ne∣cessarily included in the  law of reason  or  eternal law  which is properly called  the first law  LEX  etiam  AETERNA  dicitur  LEX PRIMA  et bene dicitur prima nam fuit ante omnes alias leges et omnes aliae leges dirivantur ab ea  The LAW ETERNAL  is called the  FIRST LAW and  well is it called the first for it was before all other laws and all other laws are derived from it  In this solemn view of the  first foundation of English law  it must evidently be deemed  "a witness of God"  as well as the  second foundation  the written  word of God in the Holy Scriptures  and  both foundations  may well be expressed together by the more com∣pendious terms of  "natural and revealed religion"  In no instance whatever are  these  TWO WITNESSES OF GOD more obviously and undeniably resisted than in the  toleration of slavery  and  the Slave Trade  because these oppressions are  iniquities  which militate against  both the foundations  and therefore the present public question whether the  Slave Trade  ought or ought not to be  abolished  may fairly be deemed an infallible  touchstone  to dis∣cover the treachery of pretended  loyalists  for no man can be truly  loyal  to God and his country who is so totally devoid of  first principles  as to  favour slavery  Let those who have  ignorantly  done so recover their credit by redoubled endea∣vours to restore the honour and constitutional law of their country which has been wounded by their  treacherous  neglect of the foundations of law whereby they will otherwise  incur that indelible stain of infamy  which our  common  LAW deservedly fixes on all persons  who betray the law of the land  Legem terrae amittentes perpetuam infamiae notam inde merito incurrunt  Inst p But mark the authorities of our  common law  to this purpose  "Liberty"  is declared by the maxims of the  first foundation  to be  "inestimable"    Libertas est res inestimabilis  Jenk Cent and  Li∣berty is the greatest jewel  Grounds Rudim of Law and Equity p and therefore  cruel  of necessity must that law be deemed which  aug∣menteth slavery  and  diminisheth liberty  says the excellent and worthy Chancellor Fortescue  who in very dark times of prevailing  bestial power  nobly asserted the supreme immutable authority of  God's two witnesses  as manifested in the first prin∣ciples of our English common law or legal con∣stitution "For in behalf of  liberty"  says he "human nature always implores" or solicits fa∣vour  because  Slavery is introduced  by man  and  for vice  but LIBERTY is implanted BY GOD in the  very nature of man  wherefore when stolen by man it always earnestly longs to re∣turn as does every thing which is deprived of  natural liberty  for which reason the man who does  not favour liberty  is to be adjudged IMPIOUS and CRUEL The laws of England acknowledg∣ing these" principles "give favour to  liberty in every case  "Crudelis etiam necessario judicabitur lex quae servitutem augmentat et minuit libertatem Nam pro ea natura semper im∣plorat humana Quia ab homine et pro vitio introducta est servi∣tus Sed libertas a Deo hominis est indita naturae Quare ipsa ab homine sublata semper redire gliscit ut facit omne quod liberta∣re naturali privatur Quo IMPIUS et CRUDEL IS judicandus est qui libertati non faver Haec considerantia Angliae Jura in omni casu libertati dant favorem Chan Fort de laudibus Legum Ang∣liae c p "  A part of this sentence is cited by Lord Coke as a maxim of our  common law    Impius et crudelis  judicandus est qui libertati non favet  Co Lit viz  Impious  and  cruel is the man to be adjudged who does not favour liberty  The opposite condition there∣fore to liberty viz  slavery  is properly declared by one of our oldest English authorities in law  Fleta  to be "  contrary to nature  "Est quidem  Servitus Libertati  contrarium item Constitutio quaedam de jure Gentium qua quis Domino" or rather "Domi∣nio" "alieno CONTRA NATURAM subjicitur" c Fleta d ed p  " Fleta d edit p  which expression of Fleta is really a maxim of the  civil  or Roman law See Inst Lib tit leg and though such appeals in the Roman code to  the foundations of law  could not restrain the  belluina potestas  of Roman tyranny in any of the ten kingdoms of the beast as clearly foretold in the scriptures nor prevent improper additions to the code under the name of law yet surely the friends of  Liberty  may be thankful to the Justinian code for the authority of its testimony against  slavery  for when  the two first foundations of law  shall  hereafter  be restored through God's mercy to their due power and effectwhen these  two witnesses of God shall stand upon their feet and ascend into Heaven  i e be established above  all human authority  and be acknowledged as the irresistable  will of God  which must  BE DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN  then shall our deluded Statesmen Lawyers Commercial Politicians and Planters be compelled to understand that a more for∣cible expression of  illegality  and  iniquity  could not have been used than that by which SLAVERY is defined in the Roman code as well as by our English Fletai e that it is "CONTRA NATU∣RAM" "AGAINST NATURE" for consequent∣ly it must be  utterly illegal  a crime which by the  first foundation of English law  is justly deemed both IMPIOUS and CRUEL and which in the strong figurative language of God's prophets under the second foundation of our law is compared to the guilt of  cannabalism  or  eating human flesh  as I have shewn in my remonstrance to the Citizens  of London  Viz 'That there are also many other odious means of promoting  human destruction  to which  the guilt of Maneating  is equally  imputable  in the Scripture sense of that horrible depravity which the sacred Writers manifestly attributed to the  oppressors of the poor the orphan and the stranger  to him that  used his neighbour's service without wages and gave him not for his work  to those that  "oppressed the stranger wrongfully"  and to those perhaps more particularly who presumed to make  "private property"  of the poor and the stranger by iniquitous ordinances contrary to the  foundations of law  depriving them of  "judgment"  I mean that  protection of the laws  which is empha∣tically deemed  "the judgment of God"  and which all  legal  Kings and their Judges are still bound by their oaths to maintain viz  "judgment"  or  "due process of the law"    without respect of persons  For where this  "judgment of God"  is even only  neglected  there can be  no legal govern∣ment  but if the  neglect  of it be actually ordained by  "unrighteous decrees"  pretending to give men a  right  to do  wrong  and to  "establish iniquity by a law"  the presumption must be  heinous  in the sight of the  King of Righteousness  for in no other sense were the persons whom the Prophets charged with  "eating up the people"    flaying their skin from off them and chopping them in pieces as for the pot  c ever guilty of  Maneating  And therefore this  unnatural  crime is surely still  equally imputable  to the authors and promoters of the like oppressions in the present times who literally  flay off the skin from off  their poor  unrewarded  labourers with  Cowskin whips  and cruelly  exact all their labours  Even to be silent when the suppression of such enormities was fairly brought to a  national question  after the clearest proofs of their existence must be  highly criminal  And it would be  uncharitable  in me as a  Citizen  if I neglected this fair opportunity of a  public charity  to warn my  fellow citizens who have withheld their testimony of abhorrence  on this occasion how far this horrible guilt of  Maneating  is  really imputable  The illegal tyrannies by which this guilt is most ob∣viously incurred are indeed at a distance from your sight' c  and therefore these  unnatural crimes  of  Slavery and the SlaveTrade  must necessarily be deemed like all other  unnatural crimes  detest∣able abominable and damnable both to the souls and bodies of all that willfully promote them The severity of these expressions cannot be restrained without injustice to the high authorities on which this argument is founded  It would be an awful inquiry to trace the time when the English Nation was rendered obnoxious by  Slavery  to the application of these horrible epithets  impious cruel  c And it is wonderful how the  unnatural crime  could so long be over∣looked until usage and custom had established in all the British Colonies as a  right  this enormous  wrong  to the perversion of all legal terms We  cannot conceive that the admission of Slavery into the Colonies has been  intentional  on the part of government at home but merely through want of a fixt attention to  the two first principles of law  and religion But the sworn Judges of the Colonial Courts when the oppression first began were without excuse for permitting the evil of Slavery to take root without warning their Royal Masters of the  illegality  knowing that the  consti∣tutional law  of the kingdom is  to deny justice to no man  without exception  nulli negabimus aut differemus justitiam  Magna Charta and know∣ing that they themselves are sworn  to do justice and judgment without respect of persons  and also that under a  legal  English Government there can be but  one law  for all descriptions of persons according to two excellent maxims of the first foundation  "Turpis est pars quae non convenit cum suo toto" and  nihil in lege intolerabilius est eandem rem diverso jure cen∣seri  Grounds Rudim of Law and Eq No  and consequently that without  na∣tional reprobacy  there could be no such personal distinctions in law as SLAVEHOLDER and SLAVE so that they must be bound in duty to their King and Country to prevent in the King's name any such oppression as  Slaveholding  They ought to have known that the limited temporal permission which had been granted to the Israelites to hold  Slaves  was absolutely annulled by a subsequent command of God  to let the  oppressed go free and to break every yoke  Isaiah c lviii v and  There is no exception to this command which proves that a  total Abolition of Slavery  was at that time the declared  Will of God  which is still more clearly demonstrated by a future denun∣ciation against the practice of Slaveholders by the prophet Jeremiah just before the Israelites them∣selves were to be carried into  Slavery  for their  op∣pressions  and neglect of God's laws  Woe be to him that useth his neighbour's service  WITHOUT WAGES  and giveth him not for his work  These are  moral laws  of  eternal obliga∣tion  though recorded in the Old Testament be∣cause the  reason justice  and  mercy  of them are still obvious for  "ratio legis est anima legis"  and there∣fore surely  woe  is most alarmingly due to  all govern∣ments  or pretended legal establishments which sanction such notorious injustice and oppression Should a total disregard of the two first foun∣dations of the  Engish Law  and  Constitution  pre∣vail we shall have not only to dread the  in∣famy  incurred according to the maxim  Le∣gem Terrae amittentes  c but also to look for  divine retribution  from him who has promised to  destroy the destroyers of the earth  and to  lead into captivity  those  that led into captivity  And indeed after the most careful investigation of all the prophetical marks of the antichristian beast and its image compared with preceding times ac∣cording to the best Chronological Histories I am convinced that the accomplishment and end of the tyranny  not  by  human means  but  "without hand"  must be nearly approaching The divine ven∣geance seems ready to be poured upon us  Let not the inhabitants of Maryland and Caro∣lina conceive that because their territories are not included within the bounds of the four great mo∣narchies the theatre of the prophetical examples of  Divine vengeance  that they shall be less liable to the awful effects of it For be assured that when the ten kingdoms of Bestial Roman Government are destroyed the  will of God  as expressed in the two foundations of English law  natural  and  re∣vealed religion  God's two witnesses will cer∣tainly be established  "on earth as it is in heaven"  according to the universal prayer of the Christian churchNay it will be established  under the whole heaven  Daniel vii so that the only effectual means of avoiding this universal destruction of  bestial illegality  is to acknowledge reverence and establish the  two first foundations of English Law  above all other authorities for that must be the universal effect of  the kingdom of Christ on earth  If the Legislators and Lawyers of Maryland and the Carolinas shall be able to suggest any thing  like an argument  in opposition to the high legal au∣thorities which I have cited they must have more  subtile  heads and  worse  hearts than I am willing to attribute to any one who is not obviously  actuated  by the grand spiritual enemy of man  GRANVILLE SHARP
