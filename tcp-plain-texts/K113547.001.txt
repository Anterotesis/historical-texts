 THE BEAUTIES OF ENGLISH POESY SELECTED BY OLIVER GOLDSMITH IN TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  LONDON Printed for WILLIAM GRIFFIN in Catharine Street in the Strand P s B  PREFACE  MY Bookseller having informed me that there was no collection of English Poetry among us of any estimation I thought a few Hours spent in making a proper selection would not be ill bestowed Compilations of this kind are chiefly designed for such as either want leisure skill or fortune to choose for themselves for persons whose professions turn them to different pursuits or who not yet arrived at sufficient maturity require a guide to direct their application To our youth particularly a publication  of this sort may be useful since if compiled with any share of judgement it may at once unite precept and example shew them what is beautiful and inform them why it is so I therefore offer this to the best of my judgement as the best collection that has yet appeared though as tastes are various numbers will be of a very different opinion Many perhaps may wish to see in it the poems of their favourite Authors others may wish that I had selected from works less generally read and others still may wish that I had selected from their own But my design was to give a useful unaffected compilation one that might tend to advance the reader's taste and not impress him with exalted ideas of mine Nothing so common and yet so absurd as affectation in criticism The desire of being thought to  have a more discerning taste than others has often led writers to labour after error and to be foremost in promoting deformity In this compilation I run but few risques of that kind every poem here is well known and possessed or the public has been long mistaken of peculiar merit every poem has as Aristotle expresses it a beginning a middle and an end in which however trifling the rule may seem most of the poetry in our language is deficient I claim no merit in the choice as it was obvious for in all languages the best productions are most easily found As to the short introductory criticisms to each poem they are rather designed for boys than men for it will be seen that I declined all refinement satisfied with being obvious and sincere In short if this work be useful in schools or amusing in  the closet the merit all belongs to others I have nothing to boast and at best can expect not applause but pardon

production and is perhaps the most perfect in our language It exhibits stronger powers of imagination more harmony of numbers and a greater knowledge of the world than any other of this poet's works and it is probable if our country were called upon to shew a specimen of their genius to foreigners this would be the work here fixed upon  WHAT dire offence from am'rous causes springs  What mighty contests rise from trivial things  I singThis verse to CARYL Muse is due  This ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view  Slight is the subject but not so the praise  If She inspire and He approve my lays  Say what strange motive Goddess could compel  A wellbred Lord t'assault a gentle Belle  O say what stranger cause yet unexplor'd  Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord  In tasks so bold can little men engage  And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty rage  Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray  And ope'd those eyes that must eclipse the day  Now lapdogs gave themselves the rouzing shake  And sleepless lovers just at twelve awake  Thrice rung the bell the slipper knock'd the ground  And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound  Belinda still her downy pillow prest  Her guardian SYLPH prolong'd the balmy rest  'Twas He had summon'd to her silent bed  The morning dream that hover'd o'er her head  A youth more glitt'ring than a birthnight beau  That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow  Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay  And thus in whispers said or seem'd to say  Fairest of mortals thou distinguish'd care  Of thousand bright inhabitants of air  If e'er one Vision touch thy infant thought  Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught  Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen  The silver token and the circled green  Or virgins visited by Angelpow'rs  With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs  Hear and believe thy own importance know  Nor bound thy narrow views to things below  Some secret truths from learned pride conceal'd  To Maids alone and children are reveal'd  What tho' no credit doubting Wits may give  The Fair and Innocent shall still believe  Know then unnumbered Spirits round thee fly  The light Militia of the lower sky  These tho' unseen are ever on the wing  Hang o'er the Box and hover round the Ring  Think what an equipage thou hast in air  And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair  As now your own our beings were of old  And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous mould  Thence by a soft transition we repair  From earthly vehicles to these of air  Think not when Woman's transient breath is fled  That all her vanities at once are dead  Succeeding vanities she still regards  And tho' she plays no more o'erlooks the cards  Her joy in gilded Chariots when alive  And love of Ombre after death survive  For when the Fair in all their pride expire  To their first Elements their Souls retire  The sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame  Mount up and take a Salamander's name  Soft yielding minds to Water glide away  And sip with nymphs their elemental tea  The graver Prude sinks downward to a Gnome  In search of mischief still on Earth to roam  The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair  And sport and flutter in the fields of air  Know farther yet whoever fair and chaste  Rejects mankind is by some Sylph embrac'd  For Spirits freed from mortal laws with ease  Assume what sexes and what shapes they please  What guards the purity of melting maids  In courtly balls and midnight masquerades  Safe from the treach'rous friend the daring spark  The glance by day the whisper in the dark  When kind occasion prompts their warm desires  Whe music softens and when dancing fires  'Tis but their Sylph the wise Celestials know  Tho' Honour is the word with Men below  Some nymphs there are too conscious of their face  For life predestin'd to the Gnomes embrace  These swell their prospects and exalt their pride  When offers are disdain'd and love deny'd  Then gay ideas croud the vacant brain  While Peers and Dukes and all their sweeping train  And Garters Stars and Coronets appear  And in soft sounds Your Grace salutes their ear  'Tis these that early taint the female soul  Instruct the eyes of young Coquettes to roll  Teach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know  And little hearts to flutter at a Beau  Oft when the world imagine women stray  The Sylphs thro' mystic mazes guide their way  Thro' all the giddy circle they pursue  And old impertinence expel by new  What tender maid but must a victim fall  To one man's treat but for another's ball  When Florio speaks what virgin could withstand  If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand  With varying vanities from ev'ry part  They shift the moving Toyshop of their heart  Where wigs with wigs with swordknots swordknots strive  Beaux banish beaux and coaches coaches drive  This erring mortals Levity may call  Oh blind to truth the Sylphs contrive it all  Of these am I who thy protection claim  A watchful sprite and Ariel is my name  Late as I rang'd the crystal wilds of air  In the clear Mirror of thy ruling star  I saw alas some dread event impend  Ere to the main this morning sun descend  But heav'n reveals not what or how or where  Warn'd by the Sylph oh pious maid beware  This to disclose is all thy guardian can  Beware of all but most beware of Man  He said when Shock who thought she slept too long  Leap'd up and wak'd his mistress with his tongue  'Twas then Belinda if report say true  Thy eyes first open'd on a Billetdoux  Wounds Charms and Ardors were no sooner read  But all the Vision vanish'd from thy head  And now unveil'd the Toilet stands display'd  Each silver vase in mystic order laid  First rob'd in white the Nymph intent adores  With head uncover'd the Cosmetic pow'rs  A heav'nly image in the glass appears  To that she bends to that her eyes she rears  Th' inferior Priestess at her altar's side  Trembling begins the sacred rites of Pride  Unnumber'd treasures ope at once and here  The various off'rings of the world appear  From each she nicely culls with curious toil  And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring spoil  This casket India's glowing gems unlocks  And all Arabia breathes from yonder box  The Tortoise here and Elephant unite  Transform'd to combs the speckled and the white  Here files of pins extend their shining rows  Puffs Powders Patches Bibles Billetdoux  Now awful beauty puts on all its arms  The fair each moment rises in her charms  Repairs her smiles awakens every grace  And calls forth all the wonders of her face  Sees by degrees a purer blush arise  And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes  The busy Sylphs surround their darling care  These set the head and those divide the hair  Some fold the sleeve whilst others plait the gown  And Betty's prais'd for labours not her own  Not with more glories in th' etherial plain  The sun first rises o'er the purpled main  Than issuing forth the rival of his beams  Launch'd on the bosom of the silver'd Thames  Fair Nymphs and welldress'd Youths around her shone  But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone  On her white breast a sparkling Cross she wore  Which Jews might kiss and Infidels adore  Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose  Quick as her eyes and as unfix'd as those  Favours to none to all she smiles extends  Oft she rejects but never once offends  Bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike  And like the sun they shine on all alike  Yet graceful ease and sweetness void of pride  Might hide her faults if Belles had faults to hide  If to her share some female errors fall  Look on her face and you'll forget 'em all  This nymph to the destruction of mankind  Nourish'd two Locks which graceful hung behind  In equal curls and well conspir'd to deck  With shining ringlets the smooth iv'ry neck  Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains  And mighty hearts are held in slender chains  With hairy springes we the birds betray  Slight lines of hair surprize the finny prey  Fair tresses men's imperial race insnare  And beauty draws us with a single hair  Th' advent'rous Baron the bright locks admir'd  He saw he wish'd and to the prize aspir'd  Resolv'd to win he meditates the way  By force to ravish or by fraud betray  For when success a lover's toil attends  Few ask if fraud or force attain'd his ends  For this 'ere Phoebus rose he had implor'd  Propitious heav'n and ev'ry pow'r ador'd  But chiefly Loveto Love an Altar built  Of twelve vast French Romances neatly gilt  There lay three garters half a pair of gloves  And all the trophies of his former loves  With tender billetdoux he lights the pyre  And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire  Then prostrate falls and begs with ardent eyes  Soon to obtain and long possess the prize  The pow'rs gave ear and granted half his pray'r  The rest the winds dispers'd in empty air  But now secure the painted vessel glides  The sunbeams trembling on the floating tides  While melting music steals upon the sky  And soften'd sounds along the waters die  Smooth flow the waves the Zephyrs gently play  Belinda smil'd and all the world was gay  All but the Sylphwith careful thoughts opprest  Th' impending woe sat heavy on his breast  He summons strait his Denizens of air  The lucid squadrons round the sails repair  Soft o'er the shrouds aërial whispers breathe  That seem'd but Zephyrs to the train beneath  Some to the sun their insectwings unfold  Waft on the breeze or sink in clouds of gold  Transparent forms too fine for mortal sight  Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light  Loose to the wind their airy garments flew  Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew  Dip'd in the richest tincture of the skies  Where light disports in evermingling dyes  While ev'ry beam new transient colours slings  Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings  Amid the circle on the gilded mast  Superior by the head was Ariel plac'd  His purple pinions op'ning to the sun  He rais'd his azure wand and thus begun  Ye Sylphs and Sylphids to your chief give ear  Fay Fairies Genii Elves and Daemons hear  Ye know the spheres and various tasks assign'd  By laws eternal to the aërial kind  Some in the fields of purest aether play  And bask and whiten in the blaze of day  Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high  Or roll the planets thro' the boundless sky  Some less refin'd beneath the moon's pale light  Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night  Or suck the mists in grosser air below  Or dip their pinions in the painted bow  Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main  Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain  Others on earth o'er human race preside  Watch all their ways and all their actions guide  Of these the chief the care of Nations own  And guard with arms divine the British throne  Our humbler province is to tend the Fair  Not a less pleasing tho' less glorious care  To save the powder from too rude a gale  Nor let th' imprison'd essences exhale  To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs  To steal from rainbows ere they drop in show'rs  A brighter wash to curl their waving hairs  Assist their blushes and inspire their airs  Nay oft in dreams invention we bestow  To change a Flounce or add a Furbelow  This day black Omens threat the brightest Fair  That e'er deserv'd a watchful spirit's care  Some dire disaster or by force or slight  But what or where the fates have wrap'd in night  Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law  Or some frail Chinajar receive a flaw  Or stain her honour or her new brocade  Forget her pray'rs or miss a masquerade  Or lose her heart or necklace at a ball  Or whether heav'n has doom'd that Shock must fall  Haste then ye spirits to your charge repair  The flutt'ring fan be Zephyretta's care  The drops to thee Brillante we consign  And Momentilla let the watch be thine  Do thou Crispissa tend her fav'rite Lock  Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock  To fifty chosen Sylphs of special note  We trust th' important charge the Petticoat  Oft have we known that sevenfold fence to fail  Tho' stiff with hoops and arm'd with ribs of whale  Form a strong line about the silver bound  And guard the wide circumference around  Whatever spirit careless of his charge  His post neglects or leaves the fair at large  Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins  Be stop'd in vials or transfix'd with pins  Or plang'd in lakes of bitter washes lie  Or wedg'd whole ages in a bodkin's eye  Gums and Pomatums shall his flight restrain  While clog'd he beats his silken wings in vain  Or Alum styptics with contracting pow'r  Shrink his thin essence like a shrivel'd flow'r  Or as Ixion fix'd the wretch shall feel  The giddy motion of the whirling mill  In fumes of burning Chocolate shall glow  And tremble at the sea that froths below  He spoke the spirits from the sails descend  Some orb in orb around the nymph extend  Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair  Some hang upon the pendants of her ear  With beating hearts the dire event they wait  Anxious and trembling for the birth of Fate  Close by those meads forever crown'd with flow'rs  Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs  There stands a structure of majestic frame  Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name  Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom  Of foreign Tyrants and of Nymphs at home  Here thou great Anna whom three realms obey  Dost sometimes counsel takeand sometimes tea  Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort  To taste awhile the pleasures of a Court  In various talk th' instructive hours they past  Who gave the ball or paid the visit last  One speaks the glory of the British Queen  And one describes a charming Indian screen  A third interprets motions looks and eyes  At ev'ry word a reputation dies  Snuff or the fan supply each pause of chat  With singing laughing ogling  and all that  Meanwhile declining from the noon of day  The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray  The hungry judges soon the sentence sign  And wretches hang that Jurymen may dine  The merchant from th' Exchange returns in peace  And the long labours of the toilet cease  Belinda now whom thirst of fame invites  Burns to encounter two advent'rous Knights  At Ombre singly to decide their doom  And swells her breast with conquests yet to come  Strait the three bands prepare in arms to join  Each band the number of the sacred nine  Soon as she spreads her hand th' aërial guard  Descend and sit on each important card  First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore  Then each according to the rank he bore  For Sylphs yet mindful of their ancient race  Are as when women wond'rous fond of place  Behold four Kings in majesty rever'd  With hoary whiskers and a forky beard  And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow'r  Th' expressive emblem of their softer pow'r  Four knaves in garbs succinct a trusty band  Caps on their heads and halberts in their hand  And partycolour'd troops a shining train  Drawn forth to combat on the velvet plain  The skilful nymph reviews her force with care  Let Spades be trumps she said and trumps they were  Now move to war her sable Matadores  In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors  Spadillio first unconquerable Lord  Led off two captive trumps and swept the board  As many more Manillio forc'd to yield  And march'd a victor from the verdant field  Him Basto follow'd but his fate more hard  Gain'd but one trump and one Plebeian card  With his broad sabre next a chief in years  The hoary Majesty of Spades appears  Puts forth one manly leg to sight reveal'd  The rest his manycolour'd robe conceal'd▪  The rebel Knave who dares his prince engage  Proves the just victim of his royal rage  Ev'n mighty Pam that Kings and Queens o'erthrew  And mow'd down armies in the fights of Lu  Sad chance of war now destitute of aid  Falls undistinguish'd by the victor Spade  Thus far both armies to Belinda yield  Now to the Baron fate inclines the field  His warlike Amazon her host invades  Th' imperial consort of the crown of Spades  The Club's black tyrant first her victim dy'd  Spite of his haughty mien and barb'rous pride  What boots the regal circle on his head  His giant limbs in state unwieldy spread  That long behind he trails his pompous robe  And of all monarchs only grasps the globe  The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace  Th' embroider'd King who shews but half his face  And his refulgent Queen with pow'rs combin'd  Of broken troops an easy conquest find  Clubs Diamonds Hearts in wild disorder seen  With throngs promiscuous strow the level green  Thus when dispers'd a routed army runs  Of Asia's troops and Afric's sable sons  With like confusion diff'rent nations fly  Of various habits and of various dye  The pierc'd battalions disunited fall  In heaps on heaps one fate o'erwhelms them all  The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts  And wins oh shameful chance the Queen of Hearts  At this the blood the virgin's cheek forsook  A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look  She sees and trembles at th' approaching ill  Just in the jaws of ruin and Codille  And now as oft in some distemper'd state  On one nice trick depends the gen'ral fate  An Ace of Hearts steps forth the King unseen  Lurk'd in her hand and mourn'd his captive Queen  He springs to vengeance with an eager pace  And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace  The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky  The walls the woods and long canals reply  O thoughtless mortals ever blind to fate  Too soon dejected and too soon elate  Sudden these honours shall be snatch'd away  And curs'd for ever this victorious day  For lo the board with cups and spoons is crown'd  The berries crackle and the mill turns round  On shining Altars of Japan they raise  The silver lamp the fiery spirits blaze  From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide  While China's earth receives the smoaking tide  At once they gratify their scent and taste  And frequent cups prolong the rich repast  Strait hover round the fair her airy band  Some as she sipp'd the fuming liquor fann'd  Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd  Trembling and conscious of the rich brocade  Coffee which makes the politician wise  And see thro' all things with his half shut eyes  Sent up in vapours to the Baron's brain  New stratagems the radiant Lock to gain  Ah cease rash youth desist ere 'tis too late  Fear the just Gods and think of Scylla's fate  Chang'd to a bird and sent to flit in air  She dearly pays for Nisus' injur'd hair  But when to mischief mortals bend their will  How soon they find fit instruments of ill  Just then Clarissa drew with tempting grace  A twoedg'd weapon from her shining case  So ladies in Romance assist their knight  Present the spear and arm him for the fight  He takes the gift with rev'rence and extends  The little engine on his fingers ends  This just behind Belinda's neck he spread  As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head  Swift to the Lock a thousand Sprites repair  A thousand wings by turns blow back the hair  And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear  Thrice she look'd back and thrice the foe drew near  Just in that instant anxious Ariel sought  The close recesses of the Virgin's thought  As on the nosegay in her breast reclin'd  He watch'd th' ideas rising in her mind  Sudden he view'd in spite of all her art  An earthly lover lurking at her heart  Amaz'd confus'd he found his pow'r expir'd  Resign'd to fate and with a sigh retir'd  The Peer now spreads the glitt'ring forfex wide  T' inclose the Lock now joins it to divide  Ev'n then before the fatal engine clos'd  A wretched Sylph too fondly interpos'd  Fate urg'd the sheers and cut the Sylph in twain  But airy substance soon unites again  The meeting points the sacred hair dissever  From the fair head for ever and for ever  Then slash'd the living light'ning from her eyes  And skreams of horror rend th' affrighted skies  Not louder shrieks to pitying heav'n are cast  When husbands or when lapdogs breathe their last  Or when rich China vessels fall'n from high  In glitt'ring dust and painted fragments lie  Let wreathes of triumph now my temples twine  The victor cry'd the glorious prize is mine  While fish in streams or birds delight in air  Or in a coach and six the British fair  As long as Atalantis shall be read  Or the small pillow grace a Lady's bed  While visits shall be paid on solemn days  When num'rous waxlights in bright order blaze  While nymphs take treats or assignations give  So long my honour name and praise shall live  What Time would spare from Steel receives its date  And monuments like men submit to fate  Steel could the labour of the Gods destroy  And strike to dust th' imperial tow'rs of Troy  Steel could the works of mortal pride confound  And hew triumphal arches to the ground  What wonder then fair Nymph thy hairs should feel  The conqu'ring force of unresisted steel  But anxious cares the pensive Nymph oppress'd  And secret passions labour'd in her breast  Not youthful kings in Battle seiz'd alive  Not scornful virgins who their charms survive  Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss  Not ancient ladies when refus'd a kiss  Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die  Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinn'd awry  E'er felt such rage resentment and despair  As thou sad Virgin for thy ravish'd Hair  For that sad moment when the Sylphs withdrew  And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew  Umbriel a dusky melancholy sprite  As ever sully'd the fair face of light  Down to the central earth his proper scene  Repair'd to search the gloomy Cave of Spleen  Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome  And in a vapour reach'd the dismal dome  No chearful breeze this sullen region knows  The dreaded East is all the wind that blows  Here in a grotto shelter'd close from air  And screen'd in shades from day's detested glare  She sighs for ever on her pensive bed  Pain at her side and Megrim at her head  Two handmaids wait the throne alike in place  But diff'ring far in figure and in face  Here stood Illnature like an ancient maid  Her wrinkled form in black and white array'd  With store of pray'rs for mornings nights and noons  Her hand is fill'd her bosom with lampoons  There Affectation with a sickly mien  Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen  Practis'd to lisp and hang the head aside  Faints into airs and languishes with pride  On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe  Wrapt in a gown for sickness and for show  The fairones feel such maladies as these  When each new nightdress gives a new disease  A constant Vapour o'er the palace flies  Strange phantoms rising as the mists arise  Dreadful as hermits dreams in haunted shades  Or bright as visions of expiring maids  Now glaring siends and snakes on rolling spires  Pale spectres gaping tombs and purple fires  Now lakes of liquid gold Elysian scenes  And crystal domes and Angels in machines  Unnumber'd throngs on ev'ry side are seen  Of bodies chang'd to various forms by Spleen  Here living teapots stand one arm held out  One bent the handle this and that the spout  A pipkin here like Homer's Tripod walks  Here sighs a jar and there a goosepye talks  Men prove with child as pow'rful fancy works  And maids turn'd bottles call aloud for corks  Safe pass'd the Gnome thro' this fantastic band  A branch of healing Spleenwort in his hand  Then thus address'd the Pow'rHail wayward Queen  Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen  Parent of vapours and of female wit  Who give th' hysteric or poetic fit  On various tempers act by various ways  Make some take physic others scribble plays  Who cause the proud their visits to delay  And send the godly in a pet to pray  A Nymph there is that all thy pow'r disdains  And thousands more in equal mirth maintains  But oh if e'er thy Gnome could spoil a grace  Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face  Like Citronwaters matrons cheeks inflame  Or change complexions at a losing game  If e'er with airy horns I planted heads  Or rumpled petticoats or tumbled beds  Or caus'd suspicion when no soul was rude  Or discompos'd the headdress of a Prude  Or e'er to costive lapdog gave disease  Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease  Hear me and touch Belinda with chagrin  That single act gives half the world the spleen  The Goddess with a discontented air  Seems to reject him tho' she grants his pray'r  A wond'rous Bag with both her hands she binds  Like that where once Ulysses held the winds  There she collects the force of female lungs  Sighs sobs and passions and the war of tongues  A Vial next she fills with sainting fears  Soft sorrows melting griefs and flowing tears  The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away  Spreads his black wings and slowly mounts to day  Sunk in Thalestris' arms the Nymph he found  Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound  Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent  And all the Furies issu'd at the vent  Belinda burns with more than mortal ire  And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire  O wretched maid she spread her hands and cry'd  While Hampton's echoes Wretched maid reply'd  Was it for this you took such constant care  The bodkin comb and essence to prepare  For this your locks in paper durance bound  For this with tort'ring irons writh'd around  For this with fillets strain'd your tender head  And bravely bore the double loads of lead  Gods shall the ravisher display your hair  While the Eops envy and the Ladies stare  Honour forbid at whose unrival'd shrine  Ease pleasure virtue all our sex resign  Methinks already I your tears survey  Already hear the horrid things they say  Already see you a degraded toast  And all your honour in a whisper lost  How shall I then your helpless fame defend  'Twill then be infamy to seem your friend  And shall this prize th' inestimable prize  Expos'd thro' crystal to the gazing eyes  And heighten'd by the diamond's circling rays  On that rapacious hand for ever blaze  Sooner shall grass in Hydepark Circus grow  And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow  Sooner let earth air sea to Chaos fall  Men monkeys lapdogs parrots perish all  She said then raging to Sir Plume repairs  And bids her beau demand the precious hairs  Sir Plume of amber snuffbox justly vain  And the nice conduct of a clouded cane  With earnest eyes and round unthinking face  He first the snuffbox open'd then the case  And thus broke out"My Lord why what the "devil  "Zds damn the Lock 'fore Gad you must be "civil  "Plague on't 'tis past a jestnay pr'ythee pox  "Give her the hair"he spoke and rapp'd his box  It grieves me much reply'd the Peer again  Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain  But by this Lock this sacred Lock I swear  Which never more shall join its parted hair  Which never more its honours shall renew  Clipp'd from the lovely head where late it grew  That while my nostrils draw the vital air  This hand which won it shall for ever wear  He spoke and speaking in proud triumph spread  The longcontended honours of her head  But Umbriel hateful Gnome forbears not so  He breaks the Vial whence the sorrows flow  Then see the Nymph in beauteous grief appears  Her eyes halflanguishing halfdrown'd in tears  On her heav'd bosom hung her drooping head  Which with a sigh she rais'd and thus she said  For ever curs'd be this detested day  Which snatch'd my best my fav'rite curl away  Happy ah ten times happy had I been  If HamptonCourt these eyes had never seen  Yet am not I the first mistaken maid  By love of courts to num'rous ills betray'd  Oh had I rather unadmir'd remain'd  In some lone isle or distant northern land  Where the gilt chariot never marks the way  Where none learn Ombre none e'er taste Bohea  There kept my charms conceal'd from mortal eye  Like roses that in deserts bloom and die  What mov'd my mind with youthful Lords to roam  O had I stay'd and said my pray'rs at home  'Twas this the morning Omens seem'd to tell  Thrice from my trembling hand the patchbox fell  The tott'ring China shook without a wind  Nay Poll sat mute and Shock was most unkind  A Sylph too warn'd me of the threats of Fate  In mystic visions now believ'd too late  See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs  My hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares  These in two sable ringlets taught to break  Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck  The sisterlock now fits uncouth alone  And in its fellow's fate foresees its own  Uncurl'd it hangs the fatal sheers demands  And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands  Oh hadst thou cruel been content to seize  Hairs less in sight or any hairs but these  She said the pitying audience melt in tears  But Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron's ears  In vain Thalestris with reproach assails  For who can move when fair Belinda fails  Not half so fix'd the Trojan could remain  While Anna begg'd and Dido rag'd in vain  Then grave Clarissa graceful wav'd her fan  Silence ensu'd and thus the Nymph began  Say why are Beauties prais'd and honour'd most  The wise man's passion and the vain man's toast  Why deck'd with all that land and sea afford  Why Angels call'd and Angellike ador'd  Why round our coaches crowd the whiteglov'd Beaux  Why bows the sidebox from its inmost rows  How vain are all these glories all our pains  Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains  That men may say when we the frontbox grace  Behold the first in virtue as in face  Oh if to dance all night and dress all day  Charm'd the smallpox or chas'd oldage away  Who would not scorn what housewife's cares produce  Or who would learn one earthly thing of use  To patch nay ogle might become a Saint  Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint  But since alas frail beauty must decay  Curl'd or uncurl'd since Locks will turn to gray  Since painted or not painted all shall fade  And she who scorns a man must die a maid  What then remains but well our pow'r to use  And keep goodhumour still whate'er we lose  And trust me Dear goodhumour can prevail  When airs and flights and screams and scolding fail  Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll  Charms strike the sight but merit wins the soul  So spoke the Dame but no applause ensu'd  Belinda frown'd Thalestris call'd her Prude  To arms to arms the fierce Virago cries  And swift as lightning to the combat flies  All side in parties and begin th' attack  Fans clap silks rustle and tough whalebones crack  Heroes and Heroines shouts confus'dly rise  And base and treble voices strike the skies  No common weapon in their hands are found  Like Gods they fight nor dread a mortal wound  So when bold Homer makes the Gods engage  And heav'nly breasts with human passions rage  'Gainst Pallas Mars Latona Hermes arms  And all Olympus rings with loud alarms  Jove's thunder roars heav'n trembles all around  Blue Neptune storms the bellowing deeps resound  Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs the ground gives way  And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day  Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height  Clapp'd his glad wings and sate to view the fight  Propp'd on their bodkin spears the sprites survey  The growing combat or assist the fray  While thro' the press enrag'd Thalestris flies  And scatters death around from both her eyes  A Beau and Witling perish'd in the throng  One dy'd in metaphor and one in song  "O cruel Nymph a living death I bear"  Cry'd Dapperwit and sunk beside his chair  A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast  "Those eyes are made so killing"was his last  Thus on Maeander's flow'ry margin lies  Th' expiring Swan and as he sings he dies  When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down  Chloe stepp'd in and kill'd him with a frown  She smil'd to see the doughty hero slain  But at her smile the Beau reviv'd again  Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air  Weighs the men's wits against the Lady's hair  The doubtful beam long nods from side to side  At length the wits mount up the hairs subside  See fierce Belinda on the Baron flies  With more than usual lightning in her eyes  Nor fear'd the Chief th' unequal fight to try  Who sought no more than on his foe to die  But this bold Lord with manly strength endu'd  She with one finger and a thumb subdu'd  Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew  A charge of Snuff the wily virgin threw  The Gnomes direct to ev'ry atom just  The pungent grains of titillating dust  Sudden with starting tears each eye o'erflows  And the high dome reechoes to his nose  Now meet thy fate incens'd Belinda cry'd  And drew a deadly bodkin from her side  The same his ancient personage to deck  Her greatgreatgrandsire wore about his neck  In three scalrings which after melted down  Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's gown  Her infant grandame's whistle next it grew  The bells she gingled and the whistle blew  Then in a bodkin grac'd her mother's hairs  Which long she wore and now Belinda wears  Boast not my fall he cry'd insulting foe  Thou by some other shalt be laid as low  Nor think to die dejects my lofty mind  All that I dread is leaving you behind  Rather than so ah let me still survive  And burn in Cupid's flamesbut burn alive  Restore the Lock she cries and all around  Restore the Lock the vaulted roofs rebound  Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain  Roar'd for the handkerchief that caus'd his pain  But see how oft ambitious aims are cross'd  And chiefs contend till all the prize is lost  The Lock obtain'd with guilt and kept with pain  In ev'ry place is sought but sought in vain  With such a prize no mortal must be blest  So heav'n decrees with heav'n who can contest  Some thought it mounted to the Lunar sphere  Since all things lost on earth are treasur'd there  There hero's wits are kept in pond'rous vases  And Beaux in snuffboxes and tweezercases  There broken vows and deathbed alms are found  And lovers hearts with ends of ribband bound  The courtier's promises and sick man's pray'rs  The smiles of harlots and the tears of heirs  Cages for knats and chains to yoak a flea  Dry'd butterflies and tomes of casuistry  But trust the Museshe saw it upward rise  Tho' mark'd by none but quick poetic eyes  So Rome's great founder to the heav'ns withdrew  To Proculus alone confess'd in view  A sudden Star it shot thro' liquid air  And drew behind a radiant tail of hair  Not Berenice's Locks first rose so bright  The heav'ns bespangling with dishevel'd light  The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies  And pleas'd pursue its progress thro' the skies  This the Beaumonde shall from the Mall survey  And hail with music its propitious ray  This the blest Lover shall for Venus take  And send up vows from Rosamonda's lake  This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies  When next he looks thro' Galilaeo's eyes  And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom  The fate of Louis and the fall of Rome  Then cease bright Nymph to mourn thy ravish'd hair  Which adds new glory to the shining sphere  Not all the tresses that fair head can boast  Shall draw such envy as the Lock you lost  For after all the murders of your eye  When after millions slain yourself shall die  When those fair suns shall set as set they must  And all those tresses shall be laid in dust  This Lock the Muse shall consecrate to fame  And 'midst the stars inscribe Belinda's name  THE HERMIT  This poem is held in just esteem the versification being chaste and tolerably harmonious and the story told with perspicuity and conciseness It seems to have cost great labour both to Mr Pope and Parnell himself to bring it to this perfection It may not be amiss to observe that the fable is taken from one of Dr Henry Moore's Dialogues  FAR in a wild unknown to public view  From youth to age a rev'rend Hermit grew  The moss his bed the cave his humble cell  His food the fruits his drink the crystal well  Remote from man with God he pass'd the days  Pray'r all his bus'ness all his pleasure praise  A life so sacred such serene repose  Seem'd heav'n itself till one suggestion rose  That vice should triumph virtue vice obey  This sprung some doubt of providence's sway  His hopes no more a certain prospect boast  And all the tenour of his soul is lost  So when a smooth expanse receives imprest  Calm nature's image on its watry breast  Down bend the banks the trees depending grow  And skies beneath with answ'ring colours glow  But if a stone the gentle sea divide  Swift ruffling circles curl on ev'ry side  And glimmering fragments of a broken sun  Banks seas and skies in thick disorder run  To clear this doubt to know the world by sight  To find if books or swains report it right  For yet by swains alone the world he knew  Whose feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly dew  He quits his cell the Pilgrimstaff he bore  And fix'd the Scallop in his hat before  Then with the sun a rising journey went  Sedate to think and watching each event  The morn was wasted in the pathless grass  And long and lonesome was the wild to pass  But when the southern sun had warm'd the day  A youth came posting o'er a crossing way  His rayment decent his complexion fair  And soft in graceful ringlets wav'd his hair  Then near approaching Father hail he cry'd  And hail my Son the rev'rend fire reply'd  Words follow'd words from question answer flow'd  And talk of various kind deceiv'd the road  'Till each with other pleas'd and loth to part  While in their rage they differ join in heart  Thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound  Thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around  Now sunk the sun the closing hour of day  Came onward mantled o'er with sober grey  Nature in silence bid the world repose  When near the road a stately palace rose  There by the moon thro' ranks of trees they pass  Whose verdure crown'd their sloping sides of grass  It chanc'd the noble master of the dome  Still made his house the wand'ring stranger's home  Yet still the kindness from a thirst of praise  Prov'd the vain flourish of expensive ease  The pair arrive the livery'd servants wait  Their lord receives them at the pompous gate  The table groans with costly piles of food  And all is more than hospitably good  Then led to rest the day's long toil they drown  Deep sunk in sleep and silk and heaps of down  At length 'tis morn and at the dawn of day  Along the wide canals the Zephyrs play  Fresh o'er the gay parterre the breezes creep  And shake the neighb'ring wood to banish sleep  Up rise the guests obedient to the call  An early banquet deck'd the splendid hall  Rich luscious wine a golden goblet grac'd  Which the kind master forc'd the guests to taste  Then pleas'd and thankful from the porch they go  And but the landlord none had cause of woe  His cup was vanish'd for in secret guise  The younger guest purloin'd the glitt'ring prize  As one who spies a serpent in his way  Glist'ning and basking in the summer ray  Disorder'd stops to shun the danger near  Then walks with faintness on and looks with fear  So seem'd the sire when far upon the road  The shining spoil his wily partner show'd  He stopp'd with silence walk'd with trembling heart  And much he wish'd but durst not ask to part  Murm'ring he lifts his eyes and thinks it hard  That gen'rous actions meet a base reward  While thus they pass the sun his glory shrouds  The changing skies hang out their sable clouds  A sound in air presag'd approaching rain  And beasts to covert scud across the plain  Warn'd by the signs the wand'ring pair retreat  To seek for shelter at a neighb'ring seat  'Twas built with turrets on a rising ground  And strong and large and unimprov'd around  Its owner's temper tim'rous and severe  Unkind and griping caus'd a desart there  As near the miser's heavy doors they drew  Fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew  The nimble lightning mix'd with show'rs began  And o'er their heads loud rolling thunder ran  Here long they knock but knock or call in vain  Driv'n by the wind and batter'd by the rain  At length some pity warm'd the master's breast  'Twas then his threshold first receiv'd a guest  Slow creaking turns the door with jealous care  And half he welcomes in the shiv'ring pair  One frugal faggot lights the naked walls  And nature's fervour thro' their limbs recalls  Bread of the coarsest sort with eager wine  Each hardly granted serv'd them both to dine  And when the tempest first appear'd to cease  A ready warning bid them part in peace  With still remark the pond'ring Hermit view'd  In one so rich a life so poor and rude  And why should such within himself he cry'd  Lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside  But what new marks of wonder soon took place  In ev'ry settling feature of his face  When from his vest the young companion bore  That cup the gen'rous landlord own'd before  And paid profusely with the precious bowl  The stinted kindness of his churlish soul  But now the clouds in airy tumult fly  The sun emerging opes an azure sky  A fresher green the smelling leaves display  And glitt'ring as they tremble chear the day  The weather courts them from the poor retreat  And the glad master bolts the wary gate  While hence they walk the pilgrim's bosom wrought  With all the travail of uncertain thought  His partner's acts without their cause appear  'Twas there a vice and seem'd a madness here  Detesting that and pitying this he goes  Lost and confounded with the various shows  Now night's dim shades again involve the sky  Again the wand'rers want a place to lie  Again they search and find a lodging nigh  The soil improv'd around the mansion neat  And neither poorly low nor idly great  It seem'd to speak its master's turn of mind  Content and not for praise but virtue kind  Hither the walkers turn with weary feet  Then bless the mansion and the master greet  Their greeting fair bestow'd with modest guise  The courteous master hears and thus replies  Without a vain without a grudging heart  To him who gives us all I yield a part  From him you come for him accept it here  A frank and sober more than costly cheer  He spoke and bid the welcome table spread  Then talk'd of virtue till the time of bed  When the grave houshold round his hall repair  Warn'd by a bell and close the hours with pray'r  At length the world renew'd by calm repose  Was strong for toil the dappled morn arose  Before the pilgrims part the younger crept  Near the clos'd cradle where an infant slept  And writh'd his neck the landlord's little pride  O strange return grew black and gasp'd and dy'd  Horror of horrors what his only son  How look'd our hermit when the fact was done  Not hell tho' hell's black jaws in sunder part  And breathe blue fire could more assault his heart  Confus'd and struck with silence at the deed  He flies but trembling fails to fly with speed  His steps the youth pursues the country lay  Perplex'd with roads a servant show'd the way  A river cross'd the path the passage o'er  Was nice to find the servant rode before  Long arms of oaks an open bridge supply'd  And deep the waves beneath the bending glide  The youth who seem'd to watch a time to sin  Approach'd the careless guide and thrust him in  Plunging he falls and rising lifts his head  Then flashing turns and sinks among the dead  Wild sparkling rage inflames the father's eyes  He bursts the bands of fear and madly cries  Detested wretchBut scarce his speech began  When the strange partner seem'd no longer man  His youthful face grew more serenely sweet  His robe turn'd white and flow'd upon his feet  Fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair  Celestial odours breathe thro' purpled air  And wings whose colours glitter'd on the day  Wide at his back the gradual plumes display  The form etherial bursts upon his sight  And moves in all the majesty of light  Tho' loud at first the pilgrim's passion grew  Sudden he gaz'd and wist not what to do  Surprize in secret chains his words suspends  And in a calm his settling temper ends  But silence here the beauteous angel broke  The voice of music ravish'd as he spoke  Thy pray'r thy praise thy life to vice unknown  In sweet memorial rise before the throne  These charms success in our bright region find  And force an Angel down to calm thy mind  For this commission'd I forsook the sky  Nay cease to kneelthy fellowservant I  Then know the truth of government divine  And let these scruples be no longer thine  The maker justly claims that world he made  In this the right of providence is laid  Its sacred majesty thro' all depends  On using second means to work his ends  'Tis thus withdrawn in state from human eye  The Pow'r exerts his Attributes on high  Your actions uses nor controuls your will  And bids the doubting sons of men be still  What strange events can strike with more surprize  Than those which lately struck thy wond'ring eyes  Yet taught by these confess th' Almighty just  And where you can't unriddle learn to trust  The great vain man who far'd on costly food  Whose life was too luxurious to be good  Who made his ivory stands with goblets shine  And forc'd his guests to morning draughts of wine  Has with the cup the graceless custom lost  And still he welcomes but with less of cost  The mean suspicious wretch whose bolted door  Ne'er mov'd in duty to the wand'ring poor  With him I left the cup to teach his mind  That heav'n can bless if mortals will be kind  Conscious of wanting worth he views the bowl  And feels compassion touch his grateful soul  Thus artists melt the sullen oar of lead  With heaping coals of fire upon its head  In the kind warmth the metal learns to glow  And loose from dross the silver runs below  Long had our pious friend in virtue trod  But now the child halfwean'd his heart from God  Child of his age for him he liv'd in pain  And measur'd back his steps to earth again  To what excesses had his dotage run  But God to save the father took the son  To all but thee in fits he seem'd to go  And 'twas my ministry to deal the blow  The poor fond parent humbled in the dust  Now owns in tears the punishment was just  But now had all his fortune felt a wreck  Had that false servant sped in safety back  This night his treasur'd heaps he meant to steal  And what a fund of charity would fail  Thus heav'n instructs thy mind this trial o'er  Depart in peace resign and sin no more  On sounding pinions here the youth withdrew  The sage stood wond'ring as the seraph flew  Thus look'd Elisha when to mount on high  His master took the chariot of the sky  The fiery pomp ascending left the view  The prophet gaz'd and wish'd to follow too  The bending hermit here a pray'r begun  "Lord as in Heav'n on earth thy will be done"  Then gladly turning sought his ancient place  And pass'd a life of piety and peace  IL PENSEROSO  I have heard a very judicious critic say that he had an higher idea of Milton's stile in poetry from the two following poems than from his Paradise Lost It is certain the imagination shewn in them is correct and strong The introduction to both in irregular measure is borrowed from the Italians and hurts an English ear  HENCE vain deluding joys  The brood of folly without father bred  How little you bested  Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys  Dwell in some idle brain  And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess  As thick and numberless  As the gay motes that people the sunbeams  Or likest hovering dreams  The fickle pensioners of Morpheus train  But hail thou Goddess sage and holy  Hail divinest Melancholy  Whose saintly visage is too bright  To hit the sense of human sight  And therefore to our weaker view  O'erlaid with black staid wisdom's hue  Black but such as in esteem  Prince Memnon's sister might beseem  Or that starred Ethiop queen that strove  To set her beauties praise above  The SeaNymphs and their pow'rs offended  Yet thou art higher far descended  Thee brighthair'd Vesta long of yore  To solitary Saturn bore  His daughter she in Saturn's reign  Such mixture was not held a stain  Oft in glimmering bow'rs and glades  He met her and in secret shades  Of woody Ida's inmost grove  While yet there was no fear of Jove  Come pensive Nun devout and pure  Sober stedfast and demure  All in a robe of darkest grain  Flowing with majestic train  And sable stole of Cyprus lawn  Over thy decent shoulders drawn  Come but keep thy wanted state  With even step and musing gait  And looks commercing with the skies  Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes  There held in holy passion still  Forget thyself to marble till  With a sad leaden downward cast  Thou fix them on the earth as fast  And join with thee calm Peace and Quiet  Spare Fast that oft with Gods doth diet  And hears the Muses in a ring  Ay round about Jove's altar sing  And add to these retired Leisure  That in trim gardens takes his pleasure  But first and chiefest with thee bring  Him that yon soars on golden wing  Guiding the fierywheeled throne  The cherab Contemplation  And the mute silence hist along  'Less Philomel will deign a song  In her sweetest saddest plight  Smoothing the rugged brow of night  While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke  Gently o'er th' accustom'd oak  Sweet bird that shunn'st the noise of folly  Most musical most melancholy  Thee chauntress oft the woods among  I woo to hear thy evensong  And missing thee I walk unseen  On the dry smoothshaven green  To behold the wand'ring moon  Riding near her highest noon  Like one that had been led astray  Through the Heav'n's wide pathless way  And oft as if her head she bow'd  Stooping through a fleecy cloud  Oft on a plat of rising ground  I hear the faroff Curfew sound  Over some widewater'd shore  Swinging slow with sullen roar  Or if the air will not permit  Some still removed place will fit  Where glowing embers through the room  Teach light to counterfeit a gloom  Far from all resort of mirth  Save the cricket on the hearth  Or the bellman's drowsy charm  To bless the doors from nightly harm  Or let my lamp at midnight hour  Be seen in some high lonely tow'r  Where I may oft outwatch the Bear  With thrice great Hermes or unsphere  The spirit of Plato to unfold  What worlds or what vast regions hold  The immortal mind that hath forsook  Her mansion in this fleshly nook  And of those demons that are found  In fire air flood or underground  Whose power hath a true consent  With planet or with element  Sometime let gorgeous tragedy  In scepter'd pall come sweeping by  Presenting Thebes or Pelops line  Or the Tale of Troy divine  Or what though rare of later age  Ennobled hath thy buskin'd stage  But O sad Virgin that thy pow'r  Might raise Musaeus from his bower  Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing  Such notes as warbled to the string  Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek  And made Hell grant what love did seek  Or call up him that left half told  The story of Cambuscan bold  Of Camball and of Algarsife  And who had Canace to wife  That own'd the virtuous ring and glass  And of the wond'rous horse of brass  On which the Tartar king did ride  And if ought else great bards beside  In sage and solemn tunes have sung  Of tourneys and of trophies hung  Of forests and inchantments drear  Where more is meant than meets the ear  Thus night oft see me in thy pale career  Till civilsuited morn appear  Not trickt and frounct as she was wont  With the Attic boy to hunt  But kercheft in a comely cloud  While rocking winds are piping loud  Or usher'd with a shower still  When the gust hath blown its fill  Ending on the rustling leaves  With minute drops from off the eaves  And when the sun begins to fling  His flaring beams me Goddess bring  To arched walks of twilight groves  And shadows brown that Sylvan loves  Of pine or monumental oak  Where the rude ax with heaved stroke  Was never heard the nymphs to daunt  Or fright them from their hallow'd haunt  There in close covert by some brook  Where no profaner eye may look  Hide me from day's garish eye  While the bee with honey'd thigh  That at her flow'ry work doth sing  And the waters murmuring  With such consort as they keep  Entice the dewy feather'd sleep  And let some strange mysterious dream  Wave at his wings in aery stream  Of lively portraiture display'd  Softly on my eyelids laid  And as I wake sweet music breathe  Above about or underneath  Sent by some Spirit to mortals good  Or th' unseen Genius of the wood  But let my due feet never fail  To walk the studious cloysters pale  And love the high embowed roof  With antic pillars massy proof  And storied windows richly dight  Casting a dim religious light  There let the pealing organ blow  To the full voic'd quire below  In service high and anthems clear  As may with sweetness through mine ear  Dissolve me into extasies  And bring all Heav'n before mine eyes  And may at last my weary age  Find out the peaceful hermitage  The hairy grown and mossy cell  Where I may sit and rightly spell  Of every star that Heaven doth shew  And every herb that sips the dew  Till old experience do attain  To something like prophetic strain  These pleasures Melancholy give  And I with thee will choose to live  L'ALLEGRO  HENCE loathed Melancholy  Of Cerberus and blackest Midnight born  In Stygian cave forlorn  'Mongst horrid shapes and shrieks and sights unholy  Find out some uncouth cell  Where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings  And the night raven sings  There under ebon shades and lowbrow'd rocks  As ragged as thy locks  In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell  But come thou goddess fair and free  In Heav'n yclep'd Euphrosine  And by men hearteasing Mirth  Whom lovely Venus at a birth  With two sister graces more  To ivycrowned Bacchus bore  Or whether as some sages sing  The frolic wind that breathes the spring  Zephyr with Aurora playing  As he met her once a maying  There on beds of violets blue  And fresh blown roses wash'd in dew  Fill'd her with thee a daughter fair  So buxom blithe and debonair  Haste thee nymph and bring with thee  Jest and youthful Jollity  Quips and Cranks and wanton Wiles  Nods and Becks and wreathed Smiles  Such as hang on Hebe's cheek  And love to live in dimple sleek  Sport that wrinkled Care derides  And Laughter holding both his sides  Come and trip it as you go  On the light fantastic toe  And in thy right hand lead with thee  The mountain nymph sweet Liberty  And if I give thee honour due  Mirth admit me of thy crew  To live with her and live with thee  In unreproved pleasures free  To hear the lark begin his flight  And singing startle the dull night  From his watchtow'r in the skies  Till the dappled dawn doth rise  Then to come in spite of sorrow  And at my window bid good morrow  Through the sweetbriar or the vine  Or the twisted eglantine  While the cock with lively din  Scatters the rear of darkness thin  And to the stack or barndoor  Stoutly struts his dames before  Oft list'ning how the hounds and horn  Chearly rouse the slumb'ring morn  From the side of some hoar hill  Through the high wood echoing shrill  Some time walking not unseen  By hedge row elms on hillocks green  Right against the eastern gate  Where the great sun begins his state  Rob'd in flames and amber light  The clouds in thousand liveries dight  While the plowman near at hand  Whistles o'er the furrow'd land  And the milkmaid singeth blithe  And the mower whets his scythe  And every shepherd tells his tale  Under the hawthorn in the dale  Strait mine eye hath caught new pleasures  Whilst the landskip round it measures  Russet lawns and fallows gray  Where the nibbling flocks do stray  Mountains on whose barren breast  The lab'ring clouds do often rest  Meadows trim with daisies pied  Shallow brooks and rivers wide  Towers and battlements it sees  Bosom'd high in tufted trees  Where perhaps some beauty lies  The Cynosure of neighb'ring eyes  Hard by a cottage chimney smokes  From betwixt two aged oaks  Where Corydon and Thyrsis met  Are at their savory dinner set  Of herbs and other country messes  Which the neat handed Phillis dresses  And then in haste her bow'r she leaves  With Thestylis to bind the sheaves  Or if the earlier season lead  To the tann'd haycock in the mead  Sometimes with secure delight  The upland hamlets will invite  When the merry bells ring round  And the jocund rebecs sound  To many a youth and many a maid  Dancing in the chequer'd shade  And young and old come forth to play  On a sunshine holyday  Till the livelong daylight fail  Then to the spicy nutbrown ale  With stories told of many a feat  How fairy Mab the junkets eat  She was pincht and pull'd she said  And he by fryar's lanthorn led  Tells how the drudging goblin swet  To earn his creambowl duly set  When in one night ere glimpse of morn  His shadowy flale had thrash'd the corn  That ten daylab'rers could not end  Then lies him down the lubbard fiend  And stretch'd out all the chimney's length  Basks at the fire his hairy strength  And cropfull out of doors he flings  Ere the first cock his matin lings  Thus done the tales to bed they creep  By whisp'ring winds soon lull'd asleep  Towered cities please us then  And the busy hum of men  Where throngs of knights and barons bold  In weeds of peace high triumphs hold  With store of ladies whose bright eyes  Rain influence and judge the prize  Of wit or arms while both contend  To win her grace whom all commend  There let Hymen oft appear  In saffron robe with taper clear  And pomp and feast and revelry  With mask and antique pageantry  Such fights as youthful poets dream  On summer eves by haunted stream  Then to the welltrod stage anon  If Johnson's learned sock be on  Or sweetest Shakespear Fancy's child  Warble his native woodnotes wild  And ever against eating cares  Lap me in soft Lydian airs  Married to immortal verse  Such as the meeting soul may pierce  In notes with many a winding bout  Of linked sweetness long drawn out  With wanton heed and giddy cunning  The melting voice through mazes running  Untwisting all the chains that tye  The hidden soul of harmony  That Orpheus self may heave his head  From golden slumber on a bed  Of heapt Elysian flow'r and hear  Such strains as would have won the ear  Of Pluto to have quite set free  His half regain'd Eurydice  These delights if thou can'st give  Mirth with thee I mean to live  AN ELEGY Written in a Country Church Yard  This is a very fine poem but overloaded with epithet The heroic measure with alternate rhime is very properly adapted to the solemnity of the subject as it is the slowest movement that our language admits of The latter part of the poem is pathetic and interesting  THE Curfew tolls the knell of parting day  The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea  The plowman homeward plods his weary way  And leaves the world to darkness and to me  Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight  And all the air a solemn stillness holds  Save where the beetle wheels his drony flight  And drousy tinklings lull the distant folds  Save that from yonder ivymantled tow'r  The moping owl does to the Moon complain  Of such as wand'ring near her secret bow'r  Molest her ancient solitary reign  Beneath those rugged elms that yewtrees shade  Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap  Each in his narrow cell for ever laid  The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep  The breezy call of incensebreathing morn  The swallow twitt'ring from the strawbuilt shed  The cock's shrill clarion or the echoing horn  No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed  For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn  Or busy housewife ply her evening care  Nor children run to lisp their sire's return  Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share  Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield  Their surrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke  How jocund did they drive their team afield  How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke  Let not ambition mock their useful toil  Their homely joys and destiny obscure  Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile  The short and simple annals of the poor  The boast of heraldry the pomp of pow'r  And all that beauty all that wealth e'er gave  Await alike th' inevitable hour  The paths of glory lead but to the grave  Nor you ye proud impute to these the fault  If Mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophies raise  Where thro' the longdrawn isle and fretted vault  The pealing anthem swells the note of praise  Can storied urn or animated bust  Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath  Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust  Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death  Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire  Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd  Or wak'd to extasy the living lyre  But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page  Rich with the spoils of Time did ne'er unroll  Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage  And froze the genial current of the soul  Full many a gem of purest ray serene  The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear  Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen  And waste its sweetness on the desert air  Some villageHampden that with dauntless breast  The little tyrant of his fields withstood  Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest  Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood  Th' applause of list'ning senates to command  The threats of pain and ruin to despise  To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land  And read their history in a nation's eyes  Their lot forbad nor circumscrib'd alone  Their growing virtues but their crimes confin'd  Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind  The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide  To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame  Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride  With incense kindled at the muse's flame  Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray  Along the cool sequester'd vale of life  They kept the noiseless tenor of their way  Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect  Some frail memorial still erected nigh  With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd  Implores the passing tribute of a sigh  Their name their years spelt by th' unletter'd muse  The place of fame and elegy supply  And many a holy text around she strews  That teach the rustic moralist to dye  For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd  Left the warm precincts of the chearful day  Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind  On some fond breast the parting soul relies  Some pious drops the closing eye requires  Ev'n from the tomb the voice of nature cries  Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires  For thee who mindful of th' unhonour'd dead  Dost in these lines their artless tale relate  If chance by lonely Contemplation led  Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate  Haply some hoaryheaded swain may say  "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn  Brushing with hasty steps the dews away  To meet the sun upon the upland lawn  There at the foot of yonder nodding beech  That wriths its old fantastic roots so high  His listless length at noontide would he stretch  And pore upon the brook that babbles by  Hard by yon wood now smiling as in scorn  Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he wou'd rove  Now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn  Or craz'd with care or cross'd in hopeless love  One morn I miss'd him on the 'custom'd hill  Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree  Another came nor yet beside the rill  Nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he  The next with dirges due in sad array  Slow thro' the churchyard path we saw him borne  Approach and read for thou can'st read the lay  Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn"  THE EPITAPH  Here rests his head upon the lap of earth  A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown  Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth  And Melancholy mark'd him for her own  Large was his bounty and his soul sincere  Heav'n did a recompence as largely send  He gave to mis'ry all he had a tear  He gain'd from Heav'n 'twas all he wish'd a friend  No farther seek his merits to disclose  Or draw his frailties from their dread abode  There they alike in trembling hope repose  The bosom of his Father and his God  LONDON In Imitation of the Third Satire of JUVENAL  This poem of Mr Johnson's is the best imitation of the original that has appeared in our language being possessed of all the force and satyrical resentment of Juvenal Imitation gives us a much truer idea of the ancients than even translation could do  THO' grief and fondness in my breast rebel  When injur'd Thales bids the town farewel  Yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend  I praise the hermit but regret the friend  Who now resolves from vice and London far  To breathe in distant fields a purer air  And fix'd on Cambria's solitary shore  Give to St David one true Briton more  For who wou'd leave unbrib'd Hibernia's land  Or change the rocks of Scotland for the Strand  There none are swept by sudden fate away  But all whom hunger spares with age decay  Here malice rapine accident conspire  And now a rabble rages now a fire  Their ambush here relentless ruffians lay  And here the fell attorney prowls for prey  Here falling houses thunder on your head  And here a female atheist talks you dead  While Thales waits the wherry that contains  Of dissipated wealth the small remains  On Thames's bank in silent thought we stood  Where Greenwich smiles upon the silver flood  Struck with the seat that gave Eliza birth  We kneel and kiss the consecrated earth  In pleasing dreams the blissful age renew  And call Britannia's glories back to view  Behold her cross triumphant on the main  The guard of commerce and the dread of Spain  Ere masquerades debauch'd excise oppress'd  Or English honour grew a standing jest  A transient calm the happy scenes bestow  And for a moment lull the sense of woe  At length awaking with contemptuous frown  Indignant Thales eyes the neighb'ring town  Since worth he cries in these degen'rate days  Wants e'en the cheap reward of empty praise  In those curst walls devote to vice and gain  Since unrewarded science toils in vain  Since hope but sooths to double my distress  And ev'ry moment leaves my little less  While yet my steady steps no staff sustains  And life still vig'rous revels in my veins  Grant me kind heaven to find some happier place  Where honesty and sense are no disgrace  Some pleasing bank where verdant osiers play  Some peaceful vale with nature's painting gay  Where once the harrass'd Briton found repose  And safe in poverty defy'd his foes  Some secret cell ye pow'rs indulgent give  Let live here for has learn'd to live  Here let those reign whom pensions can incite  To vote a patriot black a courtier white  Explain their country's dearbought rights away  And plead for pirates in the face of day  With slavish tenets taint our poinson'd youth  And lend a lye the confidence of truth  Let such raise palaces and manors buy  Collect a tax or farm a lottery  With warbling eunuchs fill a licens'd stage  And lull to servitude a thoughtless age  Heroes proceed what bounds your pride shall hold  What check restrain your thirst of pow'r and gold  Behold rebellious virtue quite o'erthrown  Behold our fame our wealth our lives your own  To such a groaning nation's spoils are giv'n  When public crimes inflame the wrath of heav'n  But what my friend what hope remains for me  Who start at theft and blush at perjury  Who scarce forbear tho' Britain's court he sing  To pluck a titled poet's borrow'd wing  A statesman's logic unconvinc'd can hear  And dare to slumber o'er the Gazetteer  Despise a fool in half his pension dress'd  And strive in vain to laugh at Hy's jest  Others with softer smiles and subtler art  Can sap the principles or taint the heart  With more address a lover's note convey  Or bribe a virgin's innocence away  Well may they rise while I whose rustic tongue  Ne'er knew to puzzle right or varnish wrong  Spurn'd as a beggar dreaded as a spy  Live unregarded unlamented die  For what but social guilt the friend endears  Who shares Orgilio's crimes his fortune shares  But thou should tempting villainy present  All Marlb'rough hoarded or all Villiers spent  Turn from the glitt'ring bribe thy scornful eye  Nor sell for gold what gold could never buy  The peaceful slumber selfapproving day  Unsullied fame and conscience ever gay  The cheated nation's happy fav'rites see  Mark whom the great caress who frown on me  London the needy villain's gen'ral home  The common sewer of Paris and of Rome  With eager thirst by folly or by fate  Sucks in the dregs of each corrupted state  Forgive my transports on a theme like this  I cannot bear a French metropolis  Illustrious Edward from the realms of day  The land of heroes and of saints survey  Nor hope the British lineaments to trace  The rustic grandeur or the surly grace  But lost in thoughtless ease and empty show  Behold the warrior dwindled to a beau  Sense freedom piety refin'd away  Of France the mimic and of Spain the prey  All that at home no more can beg or steal  Or like a gibbet better than a wheel  Hiss'd from the stage or hooted from the court  Their air their dress their politics import  Obsequious artful voluble and gay  On Britain's fond credulity they prey  No gainful trade their industry can 'scape  They sing they dance clean shoes or cure a clap  All sciences a fasting Monsieur knows  And bid him go to hell to hell he goes  Ah what avails it that from slav'ry far  I drew the breath of life in English air  Was early taught a Briton's right to prize  And lisp the tales of Henry's victories  If the gull'd conqueror receives the chain  And flattery subdues when arms are vain  Studious to please and ready to submit  The supple Gaul was born a parasite  Still to his int'rest true wheree'er he goes  Wit bravery worth his lavish tongue bestows  In ev'ry face a thousand graces shine  From ev'ry tongue flows harmony divine  These arts in vain our rugged natives try  Strain out with fault'ring dissidence a lye  And gain a kick for aukward flattery  Besides with justice this discerning age  Admires their wond'rous talents for the stage  Well may they venture on the mimic's art  Who play from morn to night a borrow'd part  Practis'd their master's notions to embrace  Repeat his maxims and reflect his face  With ev'ry wild absurdity comply  And view each object with another's eye  To shake with laughter ere the jest they hear  To pour at will the counterfeited tear  And as their patron hints the cold or heat  To shake in Dogdays in December sweat  How when competitors like these contend  Can surly virtue hope to fix a friend  Slaves that with serious impudence beguile  And lye without a blush without a smile  Exalt each trifle ev'ry vice adore  Your taste in snuff your judgment in a whore  Can Balbo's eloquence applaud and swear  He gropes his breeches with a monarch's air  For arts like these preferr'd admir'd caress'd  They first invade your table then your breast  Explore your secrets with insidious art  Watch the weak hour and ransack all the heart  Then soon your illplac'd confidence repay  Commence your lords and govern or betray  By numbers here from shame or censure free  All crimes are safe but hated poverty  This only this the rigid law pursues  This only this provokes the snarling muse  The sober trader at a tatter'd cloak  Wakes from his dream and labours for a joke  With brisker air the silken courtiers gaze  And turn the varied taunt a thousand ways  Of all the griefs that harrass the distress'd  Sure the most bitter is a scornful jest  Fate never wounds more deep the gen'rous heart  Than when a blockhead's insult points the dart  Has Heaven reserv'd in pity to the poor  No pathless waste or undiscover'd shore  No secret island in the boundless main  No peaceful desart yet unclaim'd by Spain  Quick let us rise the happy seats explore  And bear oppression's insolence no more  This mournful truth is ev'ry where confess'd  SLOW RISES WORTH BY POVERTY DEPRESS'D  But here more slow where all are slaves to gold  Where looks are merchandise and smiles are sold  Where won by bribes by flatteries implor'd  The groom retails the favours of his lord  But hark th' affrighted crowd's tumultuous cries  Roll through the streets and thunder to the skies  Rais'd from some pleasing dream of wealth and power  Some pompous palace or some blissful bow'r  Aghast you start and scarce with aching sight  Sustain th' approaching fire's tremendous light  Swift from pursuing honors take your way  And leave your little All to flames a prey  Then thro' the world a wretched vagrant roam  For where can starving merit find a home  In vain your mournful narrative disclose  While all neglect and most insult your woes  Should Heaven's just bolts Orgilio's wealth confound  And spread his flaming palace on the ground  Swift o'er the land the dismal rumour flies  And public mournings pacify the skies  The laureate tribe in servile verse relate  How virtue wars with persecuting fate  With wellfeign'd gratitude the pension'd band  Refund the plunder of the beggar'd land  See while he builds the gaudy vassals come  And crowd with sudden wealth the rising dome  The price of boroughs and of souls restore  And raise his treasures higher than before  Now bless'd with all the baubles of the great  The polish'd marble and the shining plate  Orgilio sees the golden pile aspire  And hopes from angry Heav'n another fire  Could'st thou resign the park and play content  For the fair banks of Severn or of Trent  There might'st thou find some elegant retreat  Some hireling senator's deserted seat  And stretch thy prospects o'er the smiling land  For less than rent the dungeons of the Strand  There prune thy walks support thy drooping flow'rs  Direct thy rivulets and twine thy bow'rs  And while thy beds a cheap repast afford  Despise the dainties of a venal lord  There ev'ry bush with nature's music rings  There ev'ry breeze bears health upon its wings  On all thy hours security shall smile  And bless thy evening walk and morning toil  Prepare for death if here at night you roam  And sign your will before you sup from home  Some fiery fop with new commission vain  Who sleeps on brambles till he kills his man  Some frolic drunkard reeling from a feast  Provokes a broil and stabs you for a jest  Yet e'en these heroes mischievously gay  Lords of the street and terrors of the way  Flush'd as they are with folly youth and wine  Their prudent insults to the poor confine  Afar they mark the flambeau's bright approach  And shun the shining train and golden coach  In vain these dangers past your doors you close  And hope the balmy blessings of repose  Cruel with guilt and daring with despair  The midnight murd'rer bursts the faithless bar  Invades the sacred hour of silent rest  And plants unseen a dagger in your breast  Scarce can our fields such crowds at Tyburn die  With hemp the gallows and the fleet supply  Propose your schemes ye senatorian band  Whose ways and means support the sinking land  Lest ropes be wanting in the tempting spring  To rig another convoy for the kg  A single jail in Alfred's golden reign  Could half the nation's criminals contain  Fair justice then without constraint ador'd  Held high the steady scale but deep'd the sword  No spies were paid no special juries known  Blest age but ah how diff'rent from our own  Much could I add but see the boat at hand  The tide retiring calls me from the land  FarewelWhen youth and health and fortune spent  Thou fly'st for refuge to the Wilds of Kent  And tir'd like me with follies and with crimes  In angry numbers warn'st succeeding times  Then shall thy friend nor thou refuse his aid  Still foe to vice forsake his Cambrian shade  In virtue's cause once more exert his rage  Thy satire point and animate thy page  THE SCHOOLMISTRESS In Imitation of SPENCER  This poem is one of those happinesses in which a poet excels himself as there is nothing in all Shenstone which any way approaches it in merit and though I dislike the imitations of our old English poets in general yet on this minute subject the antiquity of the style produces a very ludicrous solemnity  AH me full sorely is my heart forlorn  To think how modest worth neglected lies  While partial Fame doth with her blasts adorn  Such deeds alone as pride and pomp disguise  Deeds of ill sort and mischievous emprize  Lend me thy clarion goddess let me try  To sound the praise of merit ere it dies  Such as I oft have chaunced to espy  Lost in the dreary shades of dull obscurity  In ev'ry village mark'd with little spire  Embower'd in trees and hardly known to fame  There dwells in lowly shed and mean attire  A matron old whom we schoolmistress name  Who boasts unruly brats with birch to tame  They grieven sore in piteous durance pent  Aw'd by the pow'r of this relentless dame  And ofttimes on vagaries idly bent  For unkempt hair or task unconn'd are sorely shent  And all in sight doth rise a birchen tree  Which Learning near her little dome did stowe  Whilom a twig of small regard to see  Tho' now so wide its waving branches flow  And work the simple vassals mickle woe  For not a wind might curl the leaves that blew  But their limbs shudder'd and their pulse beat low  And as they look'd they found their horror grew  And shap'd it into rods and tingled at the view  So have I seen who has not may conceive  A lifeless phantom near a garden plac'd  So doth it wanton birds of peace bereave  Of sport of song of pleasure of repast  They start they stare they wheel they look aghast  Sad servitude such comfortless annoy  May no bold Briton's riper age e'er taste  Ne superstition clog his dance of joy  Ne vision empty vain his native bliss destroy  Near to this dome is found a patch so green  On which the tribe their gambols do display  And at the door impris'ning board is seen  Lest weakly wights of smaller size should stray  Eager perdie to bask of sunny day  The noises intermix'd which hence resound  Do learning's little tenement betray  Where sits the dame disguis'd in look profound  And eyes her fairy throng and turns her wheel around  Her cap far whiter than the driven snow  Emblem right meet of decency does yield  Her apron dy'd in grain as blue I trowe  As is the harebell that adorns the field  And in her hand for sceptre she does wield  Tway birchen sprays with anxious fear entwin'd  With dark distrust and sad repentance fill'd  And stedfast hate and sharp affliction join'd  And fury uncontroul'd and chastisement unkind  Few but have ken'd in semblance meet pourtray'd  The childish faces of old Eol's train  Libs Notus Auster these in frowns array'd  How then would fare or earth or sky or main  Were the stern god to give his slaves the rein  And were not she rebellious breasts to quell  And were not she her statutes to maintain  The cot no more I ween were deem'd the cell  Where comely peace of mind and decent order dwell  A russet stole was o'er her shoulders thrown  A russet kirtle fenc'd the nipping air  'Twas simple russet but it was her own  'Twas her own country bred the flock so fair  'Twas her own labour did the fleece prepare  And sooth to say her pupils rang'd around  Thro' pious awe did term it passing rare  For they in gaping wonderment abound  And think no doubt she been the greatest wight on ground  Albeit ne flatt'ry did corrupt her truth  Ne pompous title did debauch her ear  Goody goodwoman gossip n'aunt forsooth  Or dame the sole additions she did hear  Yet these she challeng'd these she held right dear  Ne wou'd esteem him act as mought behove  Who should not honour'd eld with these revere  For never title yet so mean could prove  But there was eke a mind which did that title love  One ancient hen she took delight to feed  The plodding pattern of the busy dame  Which ever and anon impell'd by need  Into her school begirt with chickens came  Such favour did her past deportment claim  And if neglect had lavish'd on the ground  Fragment of bread she would collect the same  For well she knew and quaintly cou'd expound  What sin it were to waste the smallest crumb she found  Herbs too she knew and well of each could speak  That in her garden sipp'd the silv'ry dew  Where no vain flow'r disclos'd a gaudy streak  But herbs for use and physic not a few  Of grey renown within those borders grew  The tufted basil punprovoking thyme  Fresh baum and marygold of chearful hue  The lowly gill that never dares to climb  And more I fain would sing disdaining here to rhime  Yet euphrasy may not be left unsung  That gives dim eyes to wander leagues around  And pungent radish biting infant's tongue  And plantain ribb'd that heals the reaper's wound  And marj'ram sweet in shepherd's posie found  And lavender whose spikes of azure bloom  Shall be erewhile in arid bundles bound  To lurk amidst the labours of her loom  And crown her kerchiefs clean with mickle rare perfume  And here trim rosmarine that whilom crown'd  The daintiest garden of the proudest peer  Ere driven from its envied site it found  A sacred shelter for its branches here  Where edg'd with gold its glitt'ring skirts appear  O wassel days O customs meet and well  Ere this was banish'd from its lofty spere  Simplicity then sought this humble cell  Nor ever would she more with Thane and lordling dwell  Here oft the dame on sabbath's decent eve  Hymned such psalms as Sternhold forth did mete  If winter 'twere she to her hearth did cleave  But in her garden found a summer seat  Sweet melody to hear her then repeat  How Israel's sons beneath a foreign king  While taunting foemen did a song intreat  All for the nonce untuning ev'ry string  Up hung their useless lyressmall heart had they to sing  For she was just and friend to virtuous lore  And pass'd much time in truly virtuous deed  And in those elfins' ears would oft deplore  The times when truth by popish rage did bleed  And tortious death was true devotion's meed  And simple faith in iron chains did mourn  That nould on wooden image place her creed  And lawny saints in smould'ring flames did burn  Ah dearest Lord forefend thilk days should e'er return  In elbow chair like that of Scottish stem  By the sharp tooth of cank'ring eld defac'd  In which when he receives his diadem  Our sovereign prince and liefest liege is plac'd  The matron sate and some with rank she grac'd  The source of children's and of courtier's pride  Redress'd affronts for vile affronts there pass'd  And warn'd them not the fretful to deride  But love each other dear whatever them betide  Right well she knew each temper to descry  To thwart the proud and the submiss to raise  Some with vile copper prize exalt on high  And some entice with pittance small of praise  And other some with baleful sprig she 'frays  Ev'n absent she the reins of pow'r doth hold  While with quaint arts the giddy crowd she sways  Forewarn'd if little bird their pranks behold  'Twill whisper in her ear and all the scene unfold  Lo now with state she utters the command  Eftsoons the urchins to their tasks repair  Their books of stature small they take in hand  Which with pellucid horn secured are  To save from finger wet the letters fair  The work so gay that on their back is seen  St George's high atchievements does declare  On which thilk wight that has ygazing been  Kens the forthcoming rod unpleasing sight I ween  Ah luckless he and born beneath the beam  Of evil star it irks me whilst I write  As erst the bard by Mulla's silver stream  Oft as he told of deadly dolorous plight  Sigh'd as he sung and did in tears indite  For brandishing the rod she doth begin  To loose the brogues the stripling's late delight  And down they drop appears his dainty skin  Fair as the furry coat of whitest ermilin  O ruthful scene when from a nook obscure  His little sister doth his peril see  All playful as she sate she grows demure  She finds full soon her wonted spirits flee  She meditates a pray'r to set him free  Nor gentle pardon could this dame deny  If gentle pardon could with dames agree  To her sad grief that swells in either eye  And wrings her so that all for pity she could die  Nor longer can she now her shrieks command  And hardly she forbears thro' aweful fear  To rushen forth and with presumptuous hand  To stay harsh justice in its mid career  On thee she calls on thee her parent dear  Ah too remote to ward the shameful blow  She sees no kind domestic visage near  And soon a flood of tears begins to flow  And gives a loose at last to unavailing woe  But ah what pen his piteous plight may trace  Or what device his loud laments explain  The form uncouth of his disguised face  The pallid hue that dyes his looks amain  The plenteous show'r that does his cheek distain  When he in abject wise implores the dame  Ne hopeth aught of sweet reprieve to gain  Or when from high she levels well her aim  And thro' the thatch his cries each falling stroke proclaim  The other tribe aghast with sore dismay  Attend and conn their tasks with mickle care  By turns astony'd every twig survey  And from their fellow's hateful wounds beware  Knowing I wist how each the same may share  'Till fear has taught them a performance meet  And to the wellknown chest the dame repair  Whence oft with sugar'd cates she doth 'em greet  And gingerbread yrare now certe doubly sweet  See to their seats they hye with merry glee  And in beseemly order sitten there  All but the wight of bum ygalled he  Abhorreth bench and stool and fourm and chair  This hand in mouth yfix'd that rends his hair  And eke with snubs profound and heaving breast  Convulsions intermitting does declare  His grievous wrong his dame's unjust behest  And scorns her offer'd love and shuns to be caress'd  His face besprent with liquid crystal shines  His blooming face that seems a purple flow'r  Which low to earth its drooping head declines  All smear'd and sully'd by a vernal show'r  O the hard bosoms of despotic pow'r  All all but she the author of his shame  All all but she regret this mournful hour  Yet hence the youth and hence the flow'r shall claim  If so I deem aright transcending worth and fame  Behind some door in melancholy thought  Mindless of food he dreary caitif pines  Ne for his fellow's joyaunce careth aught  But to the wind all merriment resigns  And deems it shame if he to peace inclines  And many a sullen look ascance is sent  Which for his dame's annoyance he designs  And still the more to pleasure him she's bent  The more doth he perverse her haviour past resent  Ah me how much I fear lest pride it be  But if that pride it be which thus inspires  Beware ye dames with nice discernment see  Ye quench not too the sparks of nobler fires  Ah better far than all the muses' lyres  All coward arts is valour's gen'rous heat  The firm fixt breast which fit and right requires  Like Vernon's patriot soul more justly great  Than craft that pimps for ill or flow'ry false deceit  Yet nurs'd with skill what dazling fruits appear  Ev'n now sagacious foresight points to show  A little bench of heedless bishops here  And there a chancellor in embryo  Or bard sublime if bard may e'er be so  As Milton Shakespear names that ne'er shall die  Tho' now he crawl along the ground so low  Nor weeting how the muse shou'd soar on high  Wisheth poor starv'ling elf his paperkite may fly  And this perhaps who cens'ring the design  Low lays the house which that of cards doth build  Shall Dennis be if rigid fates incline  And many an epic to his rage shall yield  And many a poet quit th' Aonian field  And sour'd by age profound he shall appear  As he who now with 'sdainful fury thrill'd  Surveys mine work and levels many a sneer  And furls his wrinkly front and cries " What stuff is here"  But now Dan Phoebus gains the middle skie  And liberty unbars her prisondoor  And like a rushing torrent out they fly  And now the grassy cirque han cover'd o'er  With boist'rous revelrout and wild uproar  A thousand ways in wanton rings they run  Heav'n shield their shortliv'd pastimes I implore  For well may freedom erst so dearly won  Appear to British elf more gladsome than the sun  Enjoy poor imps enjoy your sportive trade  And chase gay flies and cull the fairest flow'rs  For when my bones in grassgreen sods are laid  For never may ye taste more careless hours  In nightly castles or in ladies bow'rs  O vain to seek delight in earthly thing  But most in courts where proud ambition tow'rs  Deluded wight who weens fair peace can spring  Beneath the pompous dome of kesar or of king  See in each sprite some various bent appear  These rudely carol most incondite lay  Those sauntering on the green with jocund leer  Salute the stranger passing on his way  Some builden fragile tenements of clay  Some to the standing lake their courses bend  With pebbles smooth at duck and drake to play  Thilk to the huxter's sav'ry cottage tend  In pastry kings and queens th' allotted mite to spend  Here as each season yields a diff'rent store  Each season's stores in order ranged been  Apples with cabbagenet ycover'd o'er  Galling full sore th' unmoney'd wight are seen  And gooseb'rie clad in liv'ry red or green  And here of lovely dye the cath'rine pear  Fine pear as lovely for thy juice I ween  O may no wight e'er pennyless come there  Lest smit with ardent love he pine with hopeless care  See cherries here ere cherries yet abound  With thread so white in tempting posies ty'd  Scatt'ring like blooming maid their glances round  With pamper'd look draw little eyes aside  And must be bought though penury betide  The plumb all azure and the nut all brown  And here each season do those cakes abide  Whose honour'd names th' inventive city own  Rend'ring thro' Britain's isle Salopia's praises known  Admir'd Salopia that with venial pride  Eyes her bright form in Severn's ambiant wave  Fam'd for her loyal cares in perils try'd  Her daughters lovely and her striplings brave  Ah midst the rest may flow'rs adorn his grave  Whose art did first these dulcet cates display  A motive fair to learning's imps he gave  Who chearless o'er her darkling region stray  'Till reason's morn arise and light them on their way  COOPER's HILL  This poem by Denham though it may have been exceeded by later attempts in description yet deserves the highest applause as it far surpasses all that went before it the concluding part though a little too much crowded is very masterly  SURE there are poets which did never dream  Upon Parnassus nor did taste the stream  Of Helicon we therefore may suppose  Those made not poets but the poets those  And as courts make not kings but kings the court  So where the muses and their train resort  Parnassus stands if I can be to thee  A poet thou Parnassus art to me  Nor wonder if advantag'd in my flight  By taking wing from thy auspicious height  Through untrac'd ways and airy paths I fly  More boundless in my fancy than my eye  My eye which swift as thought contracts the space  That lies between and first salutes the place  Crown'd with that sacred pile so vast so high  That whether 'tis a part of earth or sky  Uncertain seems and may be thought a proud  Aspiring mountain or descending cloud  Paul's the late theme of such a  Mr Waller  muse whose flight  Has bravely reach'd and soar'd above thy height  Now shalt thou stand tho' sword or time or fire  Or zeal more fierce than they thy fall conspire  Secure whilst thee the best of poets sings  Preserv'd from ruin by the best of kings  Under his proud survey the city lies  And like a mist beneath a hill doth rise  Whose state and wealth the business and the crowd  Seems at this distance but a darker cloud  And is to him who rightly things esteems  No other in effect than what it seems  Where with like haste tho' sev'ral ways they run  Some to undo and some to be undone  While luxury and wealth like war and peace  Are each the other's ruin and increase  As rivers lost in seas some secret vein  Thence reconveys there to be lost again  Oh happiness of sweet retir'd content  To be at once secure and innocent  Windsor the next where Mars with Venus dwells  Beauty with strength above the valley swells  Into my eye and doth itself present  With such an easy and unforc'd ascent  That no stupendious precipice denies  Access no horror turns away our eyes  But such a rise as doth at once invite  A pleasure and a rev'rence from the sight  Thy mighty master's emblem in whose face  Sate meekness heighten'd with majestic grace  Such seems thy gentle height made only proud  To be the basis of that pompous load  Than which a nobler weight no mountain bears  But Atlas only which supports the spheres  When nature's hand this ground did thus advance  'Twas guided by a wiser power than Chance  Mark'd out for such an use as if 'twere meant  T' invite the builder and his choice prevent  Nor can we call it choice when what we chuse  Folly or blindness only cou'd refuse  A crown of such majestic tow'rs does grace  The gods great mother when her heav'nly race  Do homage to her yet she cannot boast  Among that num'rous and celestial host  More heroes than can Windsor nor doth Fame's  Immortal book record more noble names  Not to look back so far to whom this isle  Owes the first glory of so brave a pile  Whether to Caesar Albanact or Brute  The British Arthur or the Danish Knute  Tho' this of old no less contest did move  Than when for Homer's birth sev'n cities strove  Like him in birth thou should'st be like in fame  As thine his fate if mine had been his flame  But whosoe'er it was nature design'd  First a brave place and then as brave a mind  Not to recount those sev'ral kings to whom  It gave a cradle or to whom a tomb  But thee great  Edward III and the Black Prince  Edward and thy greater son  The lillies which his father wore he won  And thy  Queen Philip  Bellona who the consort came  Not only to thy bed but to thy fame  She to thy triumph led one captive  The kings of France and Scotland  king  And brought that son which did the second bring  Then didst thou found that order whether love  Or victory thy royal thoughts did move  Each was a noble cause and nothing less  Than the design has been the great success  Which foreign kings and emperors esteem  The second honour to their diadem  Had thy great destiny but giv'n thee skill  To know as well as pow'r to act her will  That from those kings who then thy captives were  In aftertimes should spring a royal pair  Who should possess all that thy mighty pow'r  Or thy desires more mighty did devour  To whom their better fate reserves whate'er  The victor hopes for or the vanquish'd fear  That blood which thou and thy great grandsire shed  And all that since these sister nations bled  Had been unspilt had happy Edward known  That all the blood he spilt had been his own  When he that patron chose in whom are join'd  Soldier and martyr and his arms confin'd  Within the azure circle he did seem  But to foretel and prophesy of him  Who to his realms that azure round hath join'd  Which nature for their bound at first design'd  That bound which to the world's extremest ends  Endless itself its liquid arms extends  Nor doth he need those emblems which we paint  But is himself the soldier and the saint  Here should my wonder dwell and here my praise  But my fix'd thoughts my wond'ring eye betrays  Viewing a neighb'ring hill whose top of late  A chapel crown'd 'till in the common fate  Th' adjoining abbey fell may no such storm  Fall on our times where ruin must reform  Tell me my muse what monstrous dire offence  What crime could any Christian king incense  To such a rage Was't luxury or lust  Was he so temperate so chaste to just  Were these their crimes They were his own much more  But wealth is crime enough to him that's poor  Who having spent the treasures of his crown  Condemns their luxury to feed his own  And yet this act to varnish o'er the shame  Of sacrilege must bear Devotion's name  No crime so bold but would be understood  A real or at least a seeming good  Who fears not to do ill yet fears the name  And free from conscience is a slave to fame  Thus he the church at once protects and spoils  But princes' swords are sharper than their stiles  And thus to th' ages past he makes amends  Their charity destroys their faith defends  Then did religion in a lazy cell  In empty airy contemplations dwell  And like the block unmoved lay but ours  As much too active like the stork devours  Is there no temp'rate region can be known  Betwixt their frigid and our torrid zone  Cou'd we not wake from that lethargic dream  But to be restless in a worse extreme  And for that lethargy was there no cure  But to be cast into a calenture  Can knowledge have no bound but must advance  So far to make us wish for ignorance  And rather in the dark to grope our way  Than led by a false guide to err by day  Who sees these dismal heaps but would demand  What barbarous invader sack'd the land  But when he hears no Goth no Turk did bring  This desolation but a Christian king  When nothing but the name of Zeal appears  'Twixt our best actions and the worst of theirs  What does he think our sacrilege wou'd spare  When such the effects of our devotions are  Parting from thence 'twixt anger shame and fear  Those for what's past and this for what's too near  My eye descending from the hill surveys  Where Thames among the wanton vallies strays  Thames the most lov'd of all the ocean's sons  By his old sire to his embraces runs  Hasting to pay his tribute to the sea  Like mortal life to meet eternity  Tho' with those streams he no resemblance hold  Whose foam is amber and their gravel gold  His genuine and less guilty wealth t'explore  Search not his bottom but survey his shore  O'er which he kindly spreads his spacious wing  And hatches plenty for th'ensuing spring  Nor then destroys it with too fond a stay  Like mothers which their infants overlay  Nor with a sudden and impetuous wave  Like profuse kings resumes the wealth he gave  No unexpected inundations spoil  The mower's hopes or mock the ploughman's toil  But godlike his unwearied bounty flows  First loves to do then loves the good he does  Nor are his blessings to his banks confin'd  But free and common as the sea or wind  When he to boast or to disperse his stores  Full of the tributes of his grateful shores  Visits the world and in his flying towers  Brings home to us and makes both Indies ours  Finds wealth where 'tis bestows it where it wants  Cities in desarts woods in cities plants  So that to us no things no place is strange  While his fair bosom is the world's exchange  O could I flow like thee and make thy stream  My great example as it is my theme  Tho' deep yet clear tho' gentle not yet dull  Strong without rage without o'erflowing full  Heav'n her Eridanus no more shall boast  Whose fame in thine like lesser currents lost  Thy nobler streams shall visit Jove's abodes  To shine among the stars and bathe the gods  Here nature whether more intent to please  Us or herself with strange varieties  For things of wonder give no less delight  To the wise maker's than beholder's sight  Tho' these delights from several causes move  For so our children thus our friends we love  Wisely she knew the harmony of things  As well as that of sounds from discord springs  Such was the discord which did first disperse  Form order beauty through the universe  While dryness moisture coldness heat resists  All that we have and that we are subsists  While the steep horrid roughness of the wood  Strives with the gentle calmness of the flood  Such huge extremes when nature doth unite  Wonder from thence results from thence delight  The stream is to transparent pure and clear  That had the selfenamour'd youth gaz'd here  So fatally deceiv'd he had not been  While he the bottom not his face had seen  But his proud head the airy mountain hides  Among the clouds his shoulders and his sides  A shady mantle cloathes his curled brows  Frown on the gentle stream which calmly flows  While winds and storms his lofty forehead beat  The common fate of all that's high or great  Low at his foot a spacious plain is plac'd  Between the mountain and the stream embrac'd  Which shade and shelter from the hill derives  While the kind river wealth and beauty gives  And in the mixture of all these appears  Variety which all the rest indears  This scene had some bold Greek or British bard  Beheld of old what stories had we heard  Of fairies satyrs and the nymphs their dames  Their feasts their revels and their am'rous flames  'Tis still the same altho' their airy shape  All but a quick poetic sight escape  There Faunus and Sylvanus keep their courts  And thither all the horned host resorts  To graze the ranker mead that noble herd  On whose sublime and shady fronts is rear'd  Nature's great masterpiece to shew how soon  Great things are made but sooner are undone  Here have I seen the king when great affairs  Gave leave to slacken and unbend his cares  Attended to the chase by all the flow'r  Of youth whose hopes a noble prey devour  Pleasure with praise and danger they would buy  And wish a foe that would not only fly  The stag now conscious of his fatal growth  At once indulgent to his fear and sloth  To some dark covert his retreat had made  Where nor man's eye nor Heaven's should invade  His soft repose when th' unexpected sound  Of dogs and men his wakeful ear does wound  Rouz'd with the noise he scarce believes his ear  Willing to think th'illusions of his fear  Had giv'n this false alarm but straight his view  Confirms that more than all he fears is true  Betray'd in all his strengths the wood beset  All instruments all arts of ruin met  He calls to mind his strength and then his speed  His winged heels and then his armed head  With these t'avoid with that his fate to meet  But fear prevails and bids him trust his feet  So fast he flies that his reviewing eye  Has lost the chasers and his ear the cry  Exulting 'till he finds their nobler sense  Their disproportion'd speed does recompense  Then curses his conspiring feet whose scent  Betrays that safety which their swiftness lent  Then tries his friends among the baser herd  Where he so lately was obey'd and fear'd  His safety seeks the herd unkindly wise  Or chases him from thence or from him flies  Like a declining statesman left forlorn  To his friends pity and pursuers scorn  With shame remembers while himself was one  Of the same herd himself the same had done  Thence to the coverts and the conscious groves  The scenes of his past triumphs and his loves  Sadly surveying where he rang'd alone  Prince of the soil and all the herd his own  And like a bold knighterrant did proclaim  Combat to all and bore away the dame  And taught the woods to echo to the stream  His dreadful challenge and his clashing beam  Yet faintly now declines the fatal strife  So much his love was dearer than his life  Now ev'ry leaf and every moving breath  Presents a foe and ev'ry foe a death  Weary'd forsaken and pursu'd at last  All safety in despair of safety plac'd  Courage he thence resumes resolv'd to bear  All their assaults since 'tis in vain to fear  And now too late he wishes for the fight  That strength he wasted in ignoble flight  But when he sees the eager chace renew'd  Himself by dogs the dogs by men pursu'd  He strait revokes his bold resolve and more  Repents his courage than his fear before  Finds that uncertain ways unsafest are  And doubt a greater mischief than despair  Then to the stream when neither friends nor force  Nor speed nor art avail he shapes his course  Thinks not their rage so desp'rate to assay  An element more merciless than they  But fearless they pursue nor can the flood  Quench their dire thirst alas they thirst for blood  So tow'rds a ship the oarfinn'd gallies ply  Which wanting sea to ride or wind to fly  Stands but to fall reveng'd on those that dare  Tempt the last fury of extreme despair  So fares the stag among th' enraged hounds  Repels their force and wounds returns for wounds  And as a hero whom his baser foes  In troops surround now these assail now those  Though prodigal of life disdains to die  By common hands but if he can descry  Some nobler foe approach to him he calls  And begs his fate and then contented falls  So when the king a mortal shaft lets fly  From his unerring hand then glad to die  Proud of the wound to it resigns his blood  And stains the crystal with a purple flood  This a more innocent and happy chase  Than when of old but in the selfsame place  Fair Liberty pursu'd and meant a prey  To lawless power  Runnimede where that great charter was first sealed  here turn'd and stood at bay  When in that remedy all hope was plac'd  Which was or should have been at least the last  Here was that charter seal'd wherein the crown  All marks of arbitrary pow'r lays down  Tyrant and slave those names of hate and fear  The happier stile of king and subject bear  Happy when both to the same center move  When kings give liberty and subjects love  Therefore not long in force this charter stood  Wanting that seal it must be seal'd in blood  The subjects arm'd the more their princes gave  Th' advantage only took the more to crave  'Till kings by giving give themselves away  And ev'n that pow'r that should deny betray  "Who gives constrain'd but his own fear reviles  Not thank't but scorn'd nor are they gifts but spoils"  Thus kings by grasping more than they could hold  First made their subjects by oppression bold  And popular sway by forcing kings to give  More than was fit for subjects to receive  Ran to the same extremes and one excess  Made both by striving to be greater l  ss  When a calm river rais'd with sudden rains  Or snows dissolv'd o'erflows th' adjoining plains  The husbandmen with highrais'd banks secure  Their greedy hopes and this he can endure  But if with bays and dams they strive to force  His channel to a new or narrow course  No longer then within his banks he dwells  First to a torrent then a deluge swells  Stronger and fiercer by restraint he roars  And knows no bound but makes his pow'r his shores  ELOISA TO ABELARD  The harmony of numbers in this poem is very fine It is rather drawn out to too tedious a length altho' the passions vary with great judgement It may be considered as superior to any thing in the epistolary way and the many translations which have been made of it into the modern languages are in some measure a proof of this  IN these deep solitudes and awful cells  Where heav'nlypensive contemplation dwells  And evermusing melancholy reigns  What means this tumult in a vestal's veins  Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat  Why feels my heart its longforgotten heat  Yet yet I loveFrom Abelard it came  And Eloïsa yet must kiss the name  Dear fatal name rest ever unreveal'd  Nor pass these lips in holy silence seal'd  Hide it my heart within that close disguise  Where mix'd with God's his lov'd idea lies  O write it not my handthe name appears  Already writtenwash it out my tears  In vain lost Eloïsa weeps and prays  Her heart still dictates and her hand obeys  Relentless walls whose darksome round contains  Repentant sighs and voluntary pains  Ye rugged rocks which holy knees have worn  Ye grots and caverns shagg'd with horrid thorn  Shrines where their vigils paleey'd virgins keep  And pitying saints whose statues learn to weep  Tho' cold like you unmov'd and silent grown  I have not yet forgot myself to stone  All is not Heav'n's while Abelard has part  Still rebel Nature holds out half my heart  Nor pray'rs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain  Nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain  Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose  That wellknown name awakens all my woes  Oh name for ever sad for ever dear  Still breath'd in sighs still usher'd with a tear  I tremble too wheree'er my own I find  Some dire misfortune follows close behind  Line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow  Led thro' a sad variety of woe  Now warm in love now with'ring in my bloom  Lost in a convent's solitary gloom  There stern Religion quench'd th' unwilling flame  There dy'd the best of passions Love and Fame  Yet write oh write me all that I may join  Griefs to thy griefs and echo sighs to thine  Nor foes nor fortune take this pow'r away  And is my Abelard less kind than they  Tears still are mine and those I need not spare  Love but demands what else were shed in pray'r  No happier task these faded eyes pursue  To read and weep is all they now can do  Then share thy pain allow that sad relief  Ah more than share it give me all thy grief  Heav'n first taught letters for some wretch's aid  Some banish'd lover or some captive maid  They live they speak they breathe what love inspires  Warm from the soul and faithful to its fires  The virgin's wish without her fears impart  Excuse the blush and pour out all the heart  Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul  And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole  Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame  When Love approach'd me under Friendship's name  My fancy form'd thee of angelic kind  Some emanation of th' Allbeauteous Mind  Those smiling eyes attemp'ring ev'ry ray  Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day  Guiltless I gaz'd Heav'n listen'd while you sung  And truths divine came mended from that tongue  From lips like those what precept fail'd to move  Too soon they taught me 'twas no sin to love  Back thro' the paths of pleasing sense I ran  Nor wish'd an Angel whom I lov'd a Man  Dim and remote the joys of saints I see  Nor envy them that Heav'n I lose for thee  How oft when press'd to marriage have I said  Curse on all laws but those which love has made  Love free as air at sight of human ties  Spreads his light wings and in a moment flies  Let wealth let honour wait the wedded dame  August her deed and sacred be her fame  Before true passion all those views remove  Fame wealth and honour what are you to love  The jealous god when we prophane his fires  Those restless passions in revenge inspires  And bids them make mistaken mortals groan  Who seek in love for aught but love alone  Should at my feet the world's great master fall  Himself his throne his world I'd scorn 'em all  Not Caesar's empress would I deign to prove  No make me mistress to the man I love  If there be yet another name more free  More fond than mistress make me that to thee  Oh happy state when souls each other draw  When love is liberty and nature law  All then is full possessing and possess'd  No craving void left aching in the breast  Ev'n thought meets thought ere from the lips it part  And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart  This sure is bliss if bliss on earth there be  And once the lot of Abelard and me  Alas how chang'd what sudden horrors rise  A naked lover bound and bleeding lies  Where where was Eloïse her voice her hand  Her ponyard had oppos'd the dire command  Barbarian stay that bloody stroke restrain  The crime was common common be the pain  I can no more by shame by rage suppress'd  Let tears and burning blushes speak the rest  Canst thou forget that sad that solemn day  When victims at yon altar's foot we lay  Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell  When warm in youth I bade the world farewell  As with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil  The shrines all trembled and the lamps grew pale  Heav'n scarce believ'd the conquest it survey'd  And saints with wonder heard the vows I made  Yet then to those dread altars as I drew  Not on the cross my eyes were fix'd but you  Not grace or zeal love only was my call  And if I lose thy love I lose my all  Come with thy looks thy words relieve my woe  Those still at least are left thee to bestow  Still on that breast enamour'd let me lie  Still drink delicious poison from thy eye  Pant on thy lip and to thy heart be press'd  Give all thou canstand let me dream the rest  Ah no instruct me other joys to prize  With other beauties charm my partial eyes  Full in my view set all the bright abode  And make my soul quit Abelard for God  Ah think at least thy flock deserves thy care  Plants of thy hand and children of thy pray'r  From the false world in early youth they fled  By thee to mountains wilds and deserts led  You rais'd these hallow'd walls the desert smil'd  And paradise was open'd in the wild  No weeping orphan saw his father's stores  Our shrines irradiate or emblaze the floors  No silver saints by dying misers giv'n  Here brib'd the rage of illrequited Heav'n  But such plain roofs as piety could raise  And only vocal with the Maker's praise  In these lone walls their day's eternal bound  These mossgrown domes with spiry turrets crown'd  Where awful arches make a noonday night  And the dim windows shed a solemn light  Thy eyes diffus'd a reconciling ray  And gleams of glory brighten'd all the day  But now no face divine contentment wears  'Tis all blank sadness or continual tears  See how the force of others pray'rs I try  O pious fraud of am'rous charity  But why should I on other's pray'rs depend  Come thou my father brother husband friend  Ah let thy handmaid sister daughter move  And all those tender names in one thy love  The darksome pines that o'er yon rocks reclin'd  Wave high and murmur to the hollow wind  The wand'ring streams that shine between the hills  The grots that echo to the tinkling rills  The dying gales that pant upon the trees  The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze  No more these scenes my meditation aid  Or lull to rest the visionary maid  But o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves  Longsounding isles and intermingled graves  Black Melancholy sits and round her throws  A deathlike silence and a dread repose  Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene  Shades ev'ry flow'r and darkens ev'ry green  Deepens the murmur of the falling floods  And breathes a browner horror on the woods  Yet here for ever ever must I stay  Sad proof how well a lover can obey  Death only death can break the lasting chain  And here e'en then shall my cold dust remain  Here all its frailties all its flames resign  And wait 'till 'tis no sin to mix with thine  Ah wretch believ'd the spouse of God in vain  Confess'd within the slave of love and man  Assist me Heav'n but whence arose that pray'r  Sprung it from piety or from despair  Ev'n here where frozen chastity retires  Love finds an altar for forbidden sires  I ought to grieve but cannot what I ought  I mourn the lover not lament the fault  I view my crime but kindle at the view  Repent old pleasures and solicit new  Now turn'd to Heav'n I weep my past offence  Now think of thee and curse my innocence  Of all affliction taught a lover yet  'Tis sure the hardest science to forget  How shall I lose the sin yet keep the sense  And love th'offender yet detest th' offence  How the dear object from the crime remove  Or how distinguish penitence from love  Unequal task a passion to resign  For hearts so touch'd so pierc'd so lost as mine  Ere such a soul regains its peaceful state  How often must it love how often hate  How often hope despair resent regret  Conceal disdaindo all things but forget  But let Heav'n seize it all at once 'tis fir'd  Not touch'd but rapt not waken'd but inspir'd  Oh come oh teach me nature to subdue  Renounce my love my life myselfand you  Fill my fond heart with God alone for he  Alone can rival can succeed to thee  How happy is the blameless vestal's lot  The world forgetting by the world forgot  Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind  Each pray'r accepted and each wish resign'd  Labour and rest that equal periods keep  "Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep"  Desires compos'd affections ever ev'n  Tears that delight and sighs that waft to heav'n  Grace shines around her with serenest beams  And whisp'ring angels prompt her golden dreams  For her th' unfading rose of Eden blooms  And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes  For her the spouse prepares the bridal ring  For her white virgins hymenaeals sing  To sounds of heav'nly harps she dies away  And melts in visions of eternal day  Far other dreams my erring soul employ  Far other raptures of unholy joy  When at the close of each sad sorrowing day  Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away  Then conscience sleeps and leaving nature free  All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee  O curst dear horrors of allconscious night  How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight  Provoking daemons all restraint remove  And stir within me ev'ry source of love  I hear thee view thee gaze o'er all thy charms  And round thy phantom glue my clasping arms  I wakeno more I hear no more I view  The phantom flies me as unkind as you  I call aloud it hears not what I say  I stretch my empty arms it glides away  To dream once more I close my willing eyes  Ye soft illusions dear deceits arise  Alas no more methinks we wand'ring go  Thro' dreary wastes and weep each other's woe  Where round some mould'ring tow'r pale ivy creeps  And lowbrow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps  Sudden you mount you beckon from the skies  Clouds interpose waves roar and winds arise  I shriek start up the same sad prospect find  And wake to all the griefs I left behind  For thee the fates severely kind ordain  A cool suspence from pleasure and from pain  Thy life a long dead calm of fix'd repose  No pulse that riots and no blood that glows  Still as the sea ere winds were taught to blow  Or moving spirit bade the waters flow  Soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiv'n  And mild as op'ning gleams of promis'd heav'n  Come Abelard for what hast thou to dread  The torch of Venus burns not for the dead  Nature stands check'd Religion disapproves  Ev'n thou art coldyet Eloïsa loves  Ah hopeless lasting flames like those that burn  To light the dead and warm th' unfruitful urn  What scenes appear where'er I turn my view  The dear ideas where I fly pursue  Rise in the grove before the altar rise  Stain all my soul and wanton in my eyes  I waste the Matin lamp in sighs for thee  Thy image steals between my God and me  Thy voice I seem in ev'ry hymn to hear  With ev'ry bead I drop too soft a tear  When from the censer clouds of fragrance roll  And swelling organs lift the rising soul  One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight  Priests tapers temples swim before my sight  In seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd  While Altars blaze and Angels tremble round  While prostrate here in humble grief I lie  Kind virtuous drops just gath'ring in my eye  While praying trembling in the dust I roll  And dawning grace is op'ning on my soul  Come if thou dar'st all charming as thou art  Oppose thyself to Heav'n dispute my heart  Come with one glance of those deluding eyes  Blot out each bright idea of the skies  Take back that grace those sorrows and those tears  Take back my fruitless penitence and pray'rs  Snatch me just mounting from the blest abode  Assist the fiends and tear me from my God  No fly me fly me far as Pole from Pole  Rise Alps between us and whole oceans roll  Ah come not write not think not once of me  Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee  Thy oaths I quit thy memory resign  Forget renounce me hate whate'er was mine  Fair eyes and tempting looks which yet I view  Long lov'd ador'd ideas all adieu  O Grace serene oh Virtue heav'nly fair  Divine oblivion of lowthoughted care  Fresh blooming Hope gay daughter of the sky  And Faith our early immortality  Enter each mild each amicable guest  Receive and wrap me in eternal rest  See in her cell sad Eloïsa spread  Propt on some tomb a neighbour of the dead  In each low wind methinks a Spirit calls  And more than Echoes talk along the walls  Here as I watch'd the dying lamps around  From yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound  "Come sister come" it said or seem'd to say  "Thy place is here sad sister come away  Once like thyself I trembled wept and pray'd  Love's victim then tho' now a sainted maid  But all is calm in this eternal sleep  Here grief forgets to groan and love to weep  Ev'n superstition loses ev'ry fear  For God not man absolves our frailties here"  I come I come prepare your roseate bow'rs  Celestial palms and everblooming flow'rs  Thither where sinners may have rest I go  Where flames refin'd in breasts seraphic glow  Thou Abelard the last sad office pay  And smooth my passage to the realms of day  See my lips tremble and my eyeballs roll  Suck my last breath and catch my flying soul  Ah noin sacred vestments may'st thou stand  The hallow'd taper trembling in thy hand  Present the Cross before my lifted eye  Teach me at once and learn of me to die  Ah then thy oncelov'd Eloïsa see  It will be then no crime to gaze on me  See from my cheek the transient roses fly  See the last sparkle languish in my eye  'Till ev'ry motion pulse and breath be o'er  And e'en my Abelard be lov'd no more  O Death alleloquent you only prove  What dust we doat on when 'tis man we love  Then too when fate shall thy fair frame destroy  That cause of all my guilt and all my joy  In trance extatic may thy pangs be drown'd  Bright clouds descend and Angels watch thee round  From op'ning skies may streaming glories shine  And Saints embrace thee with a love like mine  May one kind grave unite each hapless name  And graft my love immortal on thy fame  Then ages hence when all my woes are o'er  When this rebellious heart shall beat no more  If ever chance two wand'ring lovers brings  To Paraclete's white walls and silver springs  O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads  And drink the falling tears each other sheds  Then sadly say with mutual pity mov'd  "O may we never love as these have lov'd"  From the full choir when loud Hosannas rise  And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice  Amid that scene if some relenting eye  Glance on the stone where our cold relics lie  Devotion's self shall steal a thought from Heav'n  One human tear shall drop and be forgiv'n  And sure if fate some future bard shall join  In sad similitude of griefs to mine  Condemn'd whole years in absence to deplore  And image charms he must behold no more  Such if there be who loves so long so well  Let him our sad our tender story tell  The wellsung woes will sooth my pensive ghost  He best can paint 'em who shall feel 'em most  AN EPISTLE FROM Mr PHILIPS to the Earl of DORSET  The opening of this poem is incomparably fine  The latter part is tedious and trifling  Copenhagen  March  FROM frozen climes and endless tracts of snow  From streams that northern winds forbid to flow  What present shall the Muse to Dorset bring  Or how so near the Pole attempt to sing  The hoary winter here conceals from sight  All pleasing objects that to verse invite  The hills and dales and the delightful woods  The flow'ry plains and silver streaming floods  By snow disguis'd in bright confusion lie  And with one dazzling waste fatigue the eye  No gentle breathing breeze prepares the spring  No birds within the desart region sing  The ships unmov'd the boist'rous winds defy  While rattling chariots o'er the ocean fly  The vast Leviathan wants room to play  And spout his waters in the face of day  The starving wolves along the main sea prowl  And to the moon in icy vallies howl  For many a shining league the level main  Here spreads itself into a glassy plain  There solid billows of enormous size  Alps of green ice in wild disorder rise  And yet but lately have I seen e'en here  The winter in a lovely dress appear  Ere yet the clouds let fall the treasur'd snow  Or winds begun thro' hazy skies to blow  At ev'ning a keen eastern breeze arose  And the descending rain unsullied froze  Soon as the silent shades of night withdrew  The ruddy morn disclos'd at once to view  The face of nature in a rich disguise  And brighten'd ev'ry object to my eyes  For ev'ry shrub and every blade of grass  And ev'ry pointed thorn seem'd wrought in glass  In pearls and rubies rich the hawthorns show  While thro' the ice the crimson berries glow  The thicksprung reeds the wat'ry marshes yield  Seem polish'd lances in a hostile field  The stag in limpid currents with surprize  Sees crystal branches on his forehead rise  The spreading oak the beech and tow'ring pine  Glaz'd over in the freezing aether shine  The frighted birds the rattling branches shun  That wave and glitter in the distant sun  When if a sudden gust of wind arise  The brittle forest into atoms flies  The crackling wood beneath the tempest bends  And in a spangled show'r the prospect ends  Or if a southern gale the region warm  And by degrees unbind the wintry charm  The traveller a miry country sees  And journies sad beneath the dropping trees  Like some deluded peasant Merlin leads  Thro' fragrant bow'rs and thro' delicious meads  While here enchanted gardens to him rise  And airy fabrics there attract his eyes  His wondring feet the magic paths pursue  And while he thinks the fair illusion true  The trackless scenes disperse in fluid air  And woods and wilds and thorny ways appear  A tedious road the weary wretch returns  And as he goes the transient vision mourns  A LETTER FROM ITALY To the Right Honourable CHARLES LORD HALIFAX In the Year MDCCI  Few poems have done more honour to English genius than this There is in it a strain of political thinking that was at that time new in our poetry Had the harmony of this been equal to that of Pope's versification it would be incontestibly the finest poem in our language but there is a dryness in the numbers which greatly lessens the pleasure excited both by the poet's judgement and imagination  WHILE you my lord the rural shades admire  And from Britannia's public posts retire  Nor longer her ungrateful sons to please  For their advantage sacrifice your ease  Me into foreign realms my fate conveys  Through nations fruitful of immortal lays  Where the soft season and inviting clime  Conspire to trouble your repose with rhime  For wheresoe'er I turn my ravish'd eyes  Gay gilded scenes and shining prospects rise  Poetic fields incompass me around  And still I seem to tread on Classic ground  For here the Muse so oft her harp has strung  That not a mountain rears its head unsung  Renown'd in verse each shady thicket grows  And ev'ry stream in heav'nly numbers flows  How am I pleas'd to search the hills and woods  For rising springs and celebrated floods  To view the Nar tumultuous in his course  And trace the smooth Clitumnus to his source  To see the Mincio draw his watry store  Through the long windings of a fruitful shore  And hoary Albula's infected tide  O'er the warm bed of smoking sulphur glide  Fir'd with a thousand raptures I survey  Eridanus through flow'ry meadows stray  The king of floods that rolling o'er the plains  The tow'ring Alps of half their moisture drains  And proudly swoln with a whole winter's snows  Distributes wealth and plenty where he flows  Sometimes misguided by the tuneful throng  I look for streams immortaliz'd in song  That lost in silence and oblivion lie  Dumb are their fountains and their channels dry  Yet run for ever by the Muse's skill  And in the smooth description murmur still  Sometimes to gentle Tiber I retire  And the fam'd river's empty shores admire  That destitute of strength derives its course  From thrifty urns and an unfruitful source  Yet sung so often in poetic lays  With scorn the Danube and the Nile surveys  So high the deathless muse exalts her theme  Such was the Boyne a poor inglorious stream  That in Hibernian vales obscurely stray'd  And unobserv'd in wild meanders play'd  'Till by your lines and Nassau's sword renown'd  Its rising billows through the world resound  Where'er the Hero's godlike acts can pierce  Or where the fame of an immortal verse  Oh cou'd the Muse my ravish'd breast inspire  With warmth like yours and raise an equal fire  Unnumber'd beauties in my verse should shine  And Virgil's Italy shou'd yield to mine  See how the golden groves around me smile  That shun the coast of Britain's stormy isle  Or when transplanted and preserv'd with care  Curse the cold clime and starve in northern air  Here kindly warmth their mounting juice ferments  To nobler tastes and more exalted scents  E'en the rough rocks with tender myrtle bloom  And trodden weeds send out a rich perfume  Bear me some God to Baia's gentle seats  Or cover me in Umbria's green retreats  Where western gales eternally reside  And all the seasons lavish all their pride  Blossoms and fruits and flow'rs together rise  And the whole year in gay confusion lies  Immortal glories in my mind revive  And in my soul a thousand passions strive  When Rome's exalted beauties I descry  Magnificent in piles of ruin lie  An amphitheatre's amazing height  Here sills my eye with terror and delight  That on its public shews Unpeopled Rome  And held Uncrowded nations in its womb  Here pillars rough with sculpture pierce the skies  And here the proud triumphal arches rise  Where the old Romans deathless acts display'd  Their base degenerate progeny upbraid  Whole rivers here forsake the fields below  And wond'ring at their height through airy channels flow  Still to new scenes my wand'ring Muse retires  And the dumb show of breathing rocks admires  Where the smooth chisel all its force has shown  And soften'd into flesh the rugged stone  In solemn silence a majestic band  Heroes and Gods and Roman Consuls stand  Stern tyrants whom their cruelties renown  And emperors in Parian marble frown  While the bright dames to whom they humbly su'd  Still show the charms that their proud hearts subdu'd  Fain would I Raphael's godlike art rehearse  And show th' immortal labours in my verse  Where from the mingled strength of shade and light  A new creation rises to my sight  Such heav'nly figures from his pencil flow  So warm with life his blended colours glow  From theme to theme with secret pleasure tost  Amidst the soft variety I'm lost  Here pleasing airs my ravish'd soul confound  With circling notes and labyrinths of sound  Here domes and temples rise in distant views  And opening palaces invite my Muse  How has kind Heav'n adorn'd the happy land  And scatter'd blessings with a wasteful hand  But what avail her unexhausted stores  Her blooming mountains and her sunny shores  With all the gifts that Heav'n and earth impart  The smiles of nature and the charms of art  While proud Oppression in her valleys reigns  And Tyranny usurps her happy plains  The poor inhabitant beholds in vain  The redd'ning Orange and the swelling grain  Joyless he sees the growing oils and wines  And in the Myrtle's fragrant shade repines  Starves in the midst of nature's bounty curst  And in the loaden vineyard dies for thirst  Oh Liberty thou goddess heav'nly bright  Profuse of bliss and pregnant with delight  Eternal pleasures in thy presence reign  And smiling Plenty leads thy wanton train  Eas'd of her load Subjection grows more light  And Poverty looks chearful in thy sight  Thou mak'st the gloomy face of Nature gay  Giv'st beauty to the Sun and pleasure to the Day  Thee goddess thee Britannia's isle adores  How has she oft exhausted all her stores  How oft in fields of death thy presence sought  Nor thinks the mighty prize too dearly bought  On foreign mountains may the Sun refine  The grape's soft juice and mellow it to wine  With Citron groves adorn a distant soil  And the fat Olive swell with floods of oil  We envy not the warmer clime that lies  In ten degrees of more indulgent skies  Nor at the coarseness of our Heav'n repine  Tho' o'er our heads the frozen Pleiads shine  'Tis Liberty that crowns Britannia's isle  And makes her barren rocks and her bleak mountains smile  Others with tow'ring piles may please the sight  And in their proud aspiring domes delight  A nicer touch to the stretch'd canvass give  Or teach their animated rocks to live  'Tis Britain's care to watch o'er Europe's fate  And hold in balance each contending state  To threaten bold presumptuous kings with war  And answer her afflicted neighbour's pray'r  The Dane and Swede rous'd up by fierce alarms  Bless the wise conduct of her pious arms  Soon as her fleets appear their terrors cease  And all the northern world lies hush'd in peace  Th' ambitious Gaul beholds with secret dread  Her thunder aim'd at his aspiring head  And fain her godlike sons wou'd disunite  By foreign gold or by domestic spite  But strives in vain to conquer or divide  Whom Nassau's arms defend and counsels guide  Fir'd with the name which I so oft have found  The distant climes and diff'rent tongues resound  I bridle in my struggling Muse with pain  That longs to launch into a bolder strain  But I've already troubled you too long  Nor dare attempt a more advent'rous song  My humble verse demands a softer theme  A painted meadow or a purling stream  Unfit for Heroes whom immortal lays  And lines like Virgil's or like your's shou'd praise  ALEXANDER's FEAST OR THE POWER OF MUSIC AN ODE In Honour of St CECILIA's Day  This ode has been more applauded perhaps than it has been felt however it is a very fine one and gives its beauties rather at a third or fourth than at a first perusal  I  'TWAS at the royal feast for Persia won  By Philip's warlike son  Aloft in awful state  The godlike hero sate  On his imperial throne  His valiant peers were plac'd around  Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound  So shou'd desert in arms be crown'd  The lovely Thais by his side  Sate like a blooming eastern bride  In flower of youth and beauty's pride  Happy happy happy pair  None but the brave  None but the brave  None but the brave deserve the fair  CHORUS  Happy happy happy pair  None but the brave  None but the brave  None but the brave deserves the fair  II  Timotheus plac'd on high  Amid the tuneful quire  With flying fingers touch'd the lyre  The trembling notes ascend the sky  And heav'nly joys inspire  The song began from Jove  Who left his blissful seats above  Such is the pow'r of mighty love  A dragon's fiery form bely'd the god  Sublime on radiant spires he rode  When he to fair Olympia press'd  And while he sought her snowy breast  Then round her slender waist he curl'd  And stamp'd an image of himself a sov'reign of the world  The list'ning crowd admire the lofty sound  A present Deity they shout around  A present Deity the vaulted roofs rebound  With ravish'd ears  The monarch hears  Assumes the god  Affects to nod  And seems to shake the spheres  CHORUS  With ravish'd ears  The monarch hears  Assumes the god  Affects to nod  And seems to shake the spheres  III  The praise of Bacchus then the sweet musician sung  Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young  The jolly god in triumph comes  Sound the trumpets beat the drums  Flush'd with a purple grace  He shews his honest face  Now gives the hautboys breath he comes he comes  Bacchus ever fair and young  Drinking joys did first ordain  Bacchus' blessings are a treasure  Drinking is the soldier's pleasure  Rich the treasure  Sweet the pleasure  Sweet is pleasure after pain  CHORUS  Bacchus' blessings are a treasure  Drinking is the soldier's pleasure  Rich the treasure  Sweet the pleasure  Sweet is pleasure after pain  IV  Sooth'd with the sound the king grew vain  Fought all his battles o'er again  And thrice he routed all his foes and thrice he slew the slain  The master saw the madness rise  His glowing cheeks his ardent eyes  And while he Heav'n and earth defy'd  Chang'd his hand and check'd his pride  He chose a mournful muse  Soft pity to infuse  He sung Darius great and good  By too severe a fate  Fallen fallen fallen fallen  Fallen from his high estate  And welt'ring in his blood  Deserted at his utmost need  By those his former bounty fed  On the bare earth expos'd he lies  With not a friend to close his eyes  With downcast looks the joyless victor sate  Revolving in his alter'd soul  The various turns of chance below  And now and then a sigh he stole  And tears began to flow  CHORUS  Revolving in his alter'd soul  The various turns of chance below  And now and then a sigh he stole  And tears began to flow  V  The mighty master smil'd to see  That love was in the next degree  'Twas but a kindred sound to move  For pity melts the mind to love  Softly sweet in Lydian measures  Soon he sooth'd his soul to pleasures  War he sung his toil and trouble  Honour but an empty bubble  Never ending still beginning  Fighting still and still destroying  If the world be worth thy winning  Think O think it worth enjoying  Lovely Thais sits beside thee  Take the good the gods provide thee  The many rend the skies with loud applause  So Love was crown'd but Mu  ic won the cause  The prince unable to conceal his pain  Gaz'd on the fair  Who caus'd his care  And sigh'd and look'd sigh'd and look'd  Sigh'd and look'd and sigh'd again  At length with love and wine at once oppress'd  The vanquish'd victor sunk upon her breast  CHORUS  The prince unable to conceal his pain  Gaz'd on the fair  Who caus'd his care  And sigh'd and look'd sigh'd and look'd  Sigh'd and look'd and sigh'd again  At length with love and wine at once oppress'd  The vanquish'd victor sunk upon her breast  VI  Now strike the golden lyre again  A louder yet and yet a louder strain  Break his bands of sleep asunder  And rouze him like a rattling peal of thunder  Hark hark the horrid sound  Has rais'd up his head  As awak'd from the dead  And amaz'd he stares around  Revenge Revenge Timotheus cries  See the furies arise  See the snakes that they rear  How they hiss in their hair  And the sparkles that flash from their eyes  Behold a ghastly band  Each a torch in his hand  Those are Grecian ghosts that in battle were slain  And unbury'd remain  Inglorious on the plain  Give the vengeance due  To the valiant crew  Behold how they toss their torches on high  How they point to the Persian abodes  And glitt'ring temples of their hostile gods  The princes applaud with a furious joy  And the king seiz'd a flambeau with zeal to destroy  Thais led the way  To light him to his prey  And like another Helen fir'd another Troy  CHORUS  And the king seiz'd a flambeau with zeal to destroy  Thais led the way  To light him to his prey  And like another Helen fir'd another Troy  VII  Thus long ago  Ere heaving bellows learn'd to blow  While organs yet were mute  Timotheus to his breathing flute  And sounding lyre  Cou'd swell the soul to rage or kindle soft desire  At last divine Cecilia came  Inventress of the vocal frame  The sweet enthusiast from her sacred store  Enlarg'd the former narrow bounds  And added length to solemn sounds  With nature's motherwit and arts unknown before  Let old Timotheus yield the prize  Or both divide the crown  He rais'd a mortal to the skies  She drew an angel down  GRAND CHORUS  At last divine Cecilia came  Inventress of the vocal frame  The sweet enthusiast from her sacred store  Enlarg'd the former narrow bounds  And added length to solemn sounds  With nature's motherwit and arts unknown before  Let old Timotheus yield the prize  Or both divide the crown  He rais'd a mortal to the skies  She drew an angel down  ODE FOR MUSIC ON ST CECILIA's DAY  This ode has by many been thought equal to the former As it is a repetition of Dryden's manner it is so far inferior to him The whole hint of Orpheus with many of the lines have been taken from an obscure Ode upon Music published in Tate's Miscellanies  I  DESCEND ye Nine descend and sing  The breathing instruments inspire  Wake into voice each silent string  And sweep the sounding lyre  In a sadlypleasing strain  Let the warbling lute complain  Let the loud trumpet sound  'Till the roofs all around  The shrill echoes rebound  While in more lengthen'd notes and slow  The deep majestic solemn organs blow  Hark the numbers soft and clear  Gently steal upon the ear  Now louder and yet louder rise  And fill with spreading sounds the skies  Exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes  In broken air trembling the wild music floats  'Till by degrees remote and small  The strains decay  And melt away  In a dying dying fall  II  By Music minds an equal temper know  Nor swell too high nor sink too low  If in the breast tumultuous joys arise  Music her soft assuasive voice applies  Or when the soul is press'd with cares  Exalts her in enlivening airs  Warriors she fires with animated sounds  Pours balm into the bleeding lover's wounds  Melancholy lifts her head  Morpheus rouzes from his bed  Sloth unfolds her arms and wakes  List'ning Envy drops her snakes  Intestine war no more our passions wage  And giddy factions hear away their rage  III  But when our country's cause provokes to arms  How martial music ev'ry bosom warms  So when the first bold vessel dar'd the seas  High on the stern the Thracian rais'd his strain  While Argo saw her kindred trees  Descend from Pelion to the main  Transported demigods stood round  And men grew heroes at the sound  Enflam'd with glory's charms  Each chief his sev'nfold shield display'd  And half unsheath'd the shining blade  And seas and rocks and skies rebound  To arms to arms to arms  IV  But when thro' all th' infernal bounds  Which flaming Phlegeton surrounds  Love strong as Death the Poet led  To the pale nations of the dead  What sounds were heard  What scenes appear'd  O'er all the dreary coasts  Dreadful gleams  Dismal screams  Fires that glow  Shrieks of woe  Sullen moans  Hollow groans  And cries of tortur'd ghosts  But hark he strikes the golden lyre  And see the tortur'd ghosts respire  See shady forms advance  Thy stone O Sisyphus stands still  Ixion rests upon his wheel  And the pale spectres dance  The furies sink upon their iron beds  And snakes uncurl'd hang list'ning round their heads  V  By the streams that ever flow  By the fragrant winds that blow  O'er th' Elysian flow'rs  By those happy souls who dwell  In yellow meads of Asphodel  Or Amaranthine bowers  By the heros' armed shades  Glitt'ring thro' the gloomy glades  By the youths that dy'd for love  Wand'ring in the myrtle grove  Restore restore Eurydice to life  Oh take the husband or return the wife  He sung and Hell consented  To hear the Poet's prayer  Stern Proserpine relented  And gave him back the fair  Thus song could prevail  O'er death and o'er hell  A conquest how hard and how glorious  Tho' fate had fast bound her  With Styx nine times round her  Yet music and love were victorious  VI  But soon too soon the lover turns his eyes  Again she falls again she dies she dies  How wilt thou now the fatal sisters move  No crime was thine if 'tis no crime to love  Now under hanging mountains  Beside the falls of fountains  Or where Hebrus wanders  Rolling in meanders  All alone  Unheard unknown  He makes his moan  And calls her ghost  For ever ever ever lost  Now with furies surrounded  Despairing confounded  He trembles he glows  Amidst Rhodope's snows  See wild as the winds o'er the desert he flies  Hark Haemus resounds with the Bacchanals cries  Ah see he dies  Yet ev'n in death Eurydice he sung  Eurydice still trembled on his tongue  Eurydice the woods  Eurydice the floods  Eurydice the rocks and hollow mountains rung  VII  Music the fiercest grief can charm  And fate's severest rage disarm  Music can soften pain to ease  And make despair and madness please  Our joys below it can improve  And antedate the bliss above  This the divine Cecilia found  And to her Maker's praise confin'd the sound  When the full organ joins the tuneful quire  Th' immortal pow'rs incline their ear  Borne on the swelling notes our souls aspire  While solemn airs improve the sacred fire  And Angels lean from heav'n to hear  Of Orpheus now no more let Poets tell  To bright Cecilia greater pow'r is given  His numbers rais'd a shade from hell  Her's lift the soul to Heav'n  THE SHEPHERD's WEEK IN SIX PASTORALS  These are Mr Gay's principal performance They were originally intended I suppose as a burlesque on those of Philips but perhaps without designing it he has hit the true spirit of pastoral poetry In fact he more resembles Theocritus than any other English pastoral writer whatsoever There runs through the whole a strain of rustic pleasantry which should ever distinguish this species of composition but how far the antiquated expressions used here may contribute to the humour I will not determine for my own part I could wish the simplicity were preserved without recurring to such obsolete antiquity for the manner of expressing it  MONDAY OR THE SQUABBLE  LOBBIN CLOUT CUDDY CLODDIPOLE  LOBBIN CLOUT  THY younglings Cuddy are but just awake  No thrustles shrill the bramble bush forsake  No chirping lark the welkin sheen invokes  No damsel yet the swelling udder strokes  O'er yonder hill does scant the dawn appear  Then why does Cuddy leave his cott so rear  CUDDY  Ah Lobbin Clout I ween my plight is guest  For he that loves a stranger is to rest  If swains belye not thou hast prov'd the smart  And Blouzelinda's mistress of thy heart  This rising rear betokeneth well thy mind  Those arms are folded for thy Blouzelind  And well I trow our piteous plights agree  Thee Blouzelinda smites Buxoma me  LOBBIN CLOUT  Ah Blouzelind I love thee more by half  Than does their fawns or cows the newfall'n calf  Woe worth the tongue may blisters sore it gall  That names Buxoma Blouzelind withal  CUDDY  Hold witless Lobbin Clout I thee advise  Lest blisters sore on thy own tongue arise  Lo yonder Cloddipole the blithsome swain  The wisest lout of all the neighb'ring plain  From Cloddipole we learnt to read the skies  To know when hail will fall or winds arise  He taught us erst the heifer's tale to view  When stuck aloft that show'rs would strait ensue  He first that useful secret did explain  That pricking corns foretold the gath'ring rain  When swallows fleet soar high and sport in air  He told us that the welkin would be clear  Let Cloddipole then hear us twain rehearse  And praise his sweetheart in alternate verse  I'll wager this same oaken staff with thee  That Cloddipole shall give the prize to me  LOBBIN CLOUT  See this tobaccopouch that's lin'd with hair  Made of the skin of sleekest fallowdeer  This pouch that's ty'd with tape of reddest hue  I'll wager that the prize shall be my due  CUDDY  Begin thy carrols then thou vaunting slouch  Be thine the oaken staff or mine the pouch  LOBBIN CLOUT  My Blouzelinda is the blithest lass  Than primrose sweeter or the clovergrass  Fair is the kingcup that in meadow blows  Fair is the daisie that beside her grows  Fair is the gilliflower of gardens sweet  Fair is the marygold for pottage meet  But Blouzelind's than gilliflow'r more fair  Than daisie marygold or kingcup rare  CUDDY  My brown Buxoma is the featest maid  That e'er at wake delightsome gambol play'd  Clean as young lambkins or the goose's down  And like the goldfinch in her Sunday gown  The witless lamb may sport upon the plain  The frisking kid delight the gaping swain  The wanton calf may skip with many a bound  And my cur Tray play deftest feats around  But neither lamb nor kid nor calf nor Tray  Dance like Buxoma on the first of May  LOBBIN CLOUT  Sweet is my toil when Blouzelind is near  Of her bereft 'tis winter all the year  With her no sultry summer's heat I know  In winter when she's nigh with love I glow  Come Blouzelinda ease thy swain's desire  My summer's shadow and my winter's fire  CUDDY  As with Buxoma once I work'd at hay  Ev'n noontide labour seem'd an holiday  And holidays if haply she were gone  Like workydays I wish'd would soon be done  Eftsoons O sweetheart kind my love repay  And all the year shall then be holiday  LOBBIN CLOUT  As Blouzelinda in a gamesome mood  Behind a haycock loudly laughing stood  I slily ran and snatch'd a hasty kiss  She wip'd her lips nor took it much amiss  Believe me Cuddy while I'm bold to say  Her breath was sweeter than the ripen'd hay  CUDDY  As my Buxoma in a morning fair  With gentle finger strok'd her milky care  I queintly stole a kiss at first 'tis true  She frown'd yet after granted one or two  Lobbin I swear believe who will my vows  Her breath by far excell'd the breathing cows  LOBBIN CLOUT  Leek to the Welch to Dutchmen butter's dear  Of Irish swains potatoe is the chear  Oats for their feasts the Scottish shepherds grind  Sweet turnips are the food of Blouzelind  While she loves turnips butter I'll despise  Nor leeks nor oatmeal nor potatoe prize  CUDDY  In good roastbeef my landlord sticks his knife  The capon fat delights his dainty wife  Pudding our parson eats the 'squire loves hare  But whitepot thick is my Buxoma's fare  While she loves whitepot capon ne'er shall be  Nor hare nor beef nor pudding food for me  LOBBIN CLOUT  As once I play'd at Blindman'sbuff it hapt  About my eyes the towel thick was wrapt  I miss'd the swains and seiz'd on Blouzelind  True speaks that ancient proverb 'Love is blind'  CUDDY  As at Hotcockles once I laid me down  And felt the weighty hand of many a clown  Buxoma gave a gentle tap and I  Quick rose and read soft mischief in her eye  LOBBIN CLOUT  On two near elms the slacken'd cord I hung  Now high now low my Blouzelinda swung  With the rude wind her rumpled garment rose  And show'd her taper leg and scarlet hose  CUDDY  Across the fallen oak the plank I laid  And myself pois'd against the tott'ring maid  High leapt the plank adown Buxoma fell  I spy'dbut faithful sweethearts never tell  LOBBIN CLOUT  This riddle Cuddy if thou can'st explain  This wily riddle puzzles every swain  What  Marygold  flower is that which bears the virgin's name  The richest metal joined with the same  CUDDY  Answer thou carle and judge this riddle right  I'll frankly own thee for a cunning wight  What  Rosemary  flower is that which royal honour craves  Adjoin the virgin and 'tis strown on graves  CLODDIPOLE  Forbear contending louts give o'er your strains  An oaken staff each merits for his pains  But see the sunbeams bright to labour warn  And gild the thatch of goodman Hodge's barn  Your herds for want of water stand adry  They're weary of your songsand so am I  TUESDAY OR THE DITTY  MARIAN  YOUNG Collin Clout a lad of peerless meed  Full well could dance and deftly tune the reed  In ev'ry wood his carols sweet were known  At ev'ry wake his nimble feats were shown  When in the ring the rustic routs he threw  The damsels pleasures with his conquests grew  Or when aslant the cudgel threats his head  His danger smites the breast of every maid  But chief of Marian Marian lov'd the swain  The parson's maid and neatest of the plain  Marian that soft could stroke the udder'd cow  Or lessen with her sieve the barley mow  Marbled with sage the harden'd cheese she press'd  And yellow butter Marian's skill confess'd  But Marian now devoid of country cares  Nor yellow butter nor sage cheese prepares  For yearning love the witless maid employs  And love say swains all busie heed destroys  Collin makes mock at all her piteous smart  A las that Cic'ly hight had won his heart  Cic'ly the western lass that tends the kee  The rival of the parson's maid was she  In dreary shade now Marian lies along  And mix'd with sighs thus wails in plaining song  Ah woful day ah woful noon and morn  When first by thee my younglings white were shorn  Then first I ween I cast a lover's eye  My sheep were silly but more silly I  Beneath the shears they felt no lasting smart  They lost but fleeces while I lost a heart  Ah Collin canst thou leave thy sweetheart true  What I have done for thee will Cic'ly do  Will she thy linen wash or hosen darn  And knit thee gloves made of her ownspun yarn  Will she with huswife's hand provide thy meat  And ev'ry Sunday morn thy neckcloth plait  Which o'er thy kersey doublet spreading wide  In service time drew Cic'ly's eyes aside  Wheree'er I gad I cannot hide my care  My new disasters in my look appear  White as the curd my ruddy cheek is grown  So thin my features that I'm hardly known  Our neighbours tell me oft in joking talk  Of ashes leather oatmeal bran and chalk  Unwittingly of Marian they divine  And wist not that with thoughtful love I pine  Yet Collin Clout untoward shepherd swain  Walks whistling blithe while pitiful I plain  Whilom with thee 'twas Marian's dear delight  To moil all day and merrymake at night  If in the soil you guide the crooked share  Your early breakfast is my constant care  And when with even hand you strow the grain  I fright the thievish rooks from off the plain  In misling days when I my thresher heard  With nappy beer I to the barn repair'd  Lost in the music of the whirling flail  To gaze on thee I left the smoaking pail  In harvest when the sun was mounted high  My leathern bottle did thy drought supply  Whene'er you mow'd I follow'd with the rake  And have full oft been sunburnt for thy sake  When in the welkin gathering show'rs were seen  I lagg'd the last with Collin on the green  And when at eve returning with thy carr  Awaiting heard the gingling bells from far  Strait on the fire the sooty pot I plac'd  To warm thy broth I burnt my hands for haste  When hungry thou stood'st staring like an oaf  I slic'd the lunceon from the barley loaf  With crumbled bread I thicken'd well thy mess  Ah love me more or love thy pottage less  Last Friday's eve when as the sun was set  I near yon stile three sallow gypsies met  Upon my hand they cast a poring look  Bid me beware and thrice their heads they shook  They said that many crosses I must prove  Some in my wordly gain but most in love  Next morn I miss'd three hens and our old cock  And off the hedge two pinners and a smock  I bore these losses with a christian mind  And no mishaps could feel while thou wert kind  But since alas I grew my Collin's scorn  I've known no pleasure night or noon or morn  Help me ye gypsies bring him home again  And to a constant lass give back her swain  Have I not sat with thee full many a night  When dying embers were our only light  When ev'ry creature did in slumbers lie  Besides our cat my Collin Clout and I  No troublous thoughts the cat or Collin move  While I alone am kept awake by love  Remember Collin when at last year's wake  I bought the costly present for thy sake  Couldst thou spell o'er the posie on thy knife  And with another change thy state of life  If thou forget'st I wot I can repeat  My memory can tell the verse so sweet  "As this is grav'd upon this knife of thine  "So is thy image on this heart of mine"  But woe is me Such presents luckless prove  For knives they tell me always sever love  Thus Marian wail'd her eyes with tears brimfull  When goody Debbins brought her cow to bull  With apron blue to dry her tears she sought  Then saw the cow well serv'd and took a groat  WEDNESDAY OR THE DUMPS  SPARABELLA  THE wailings of a maiden I recite  A maiden fair that Sparabella hight  Such strains ne'er warble in the linnet's throat  Nor the gay goldfinch chaunts so sweet a note  No magpye chatter'd nor the painted jay  No ox was heard to low nor ass to bray  No rusling breezes play'd the leaves among  While thus her madrigal the damsel sung  Awhile O D'Urfey lend an ear or twain  Nor though in homely guise my verse disdain  Whether thou seek'st new kingdoms in the sun  Whether thy muse does at Newmarket run  Or does with gossips at a feast regale  And heighten her conceits with sack and ale  Or else at wakes with Joan and Hodge rejoice  Where D'Urfey's lyrics swell in ev'ry voice  Yet suffer me thou bard of wond'rous meed  Amid thy bays to weave this rural weed  Now the sun drove adown the western road  And oxen laid at rest forget the goad  The clown fatigu'd trudg'd homeward with his spade  Across the meadows stretch'd the lengthen'd shade  When Sparabella pensive and forlorn  Alike with yearning love and labour worn  Lean'd on her rake and strait with doleful guise  Did this sad plaint in mournful notes devise  Come night as dark as pitch surround my head  From Sparabella Bumkinet is fled  The ribbon that his val'rous cudgel won  Last Sunday happier Clumsilis put on  Sure if he'd eyes but love they say has none  I whilom by that ribbon had been known  Ah well aday I'm shent with baneful smart  For with that ribbon he bestow'd his heart  My plaint ye lasses with this burthen aid  'Tis hard so true a damsel dies a maid  Shall heavy Clumsilis with me compare  View this ye lovers and like me despair  Her blubber'd lip by smutty pipes is worn  And in her breath tobacco whiffs are born  The cleanly cheesepress she could never turn  Her aukward fist did ne'er employ the churn  If e'er she brew'd the drink wou'd strait go sour  Before it ever felt the thunder's power  No huswifry the dowdy creature knew  To sum up all her tongue confess'd the shrew  My plaint ye lasses with this burthen aid  'Tis hard so true a damsel dies a maid  I've often seen my visage in yon lake  Nor are my features of the homeliest make  Though Clumsilis may boast a whiter dye  Yet the black sloe turns in my rolling eye  And fairest blossoms drop with ev'ry blast  But the brown beauty will like hollies last  Her wan complexion's like the wither'd leek  While Katherine pears adorn my ruddy cheek  Yet she alas the witless lout hath won  And by her gain poor Sparabell's undone  Let hares and hounds in coupling straps unite  The clocking hen make friendship with the kite  Let the fox simply wear the nuptial noose  And join in wedlock with the waddling goose  For love hath brought a stranger thing to pass  The fairest shepherd weds the foulest lass  My plaint ye lasses with this burthen aid  'Tis hard so true a damsel dies a maid  Sooner shall cats disport in waters clear  And speckled mackrels graze the meadows fair  Sooner shall screechowls bask in sunny day  And the slow ass on trees like squirrels play  Sooner shall snails on insect pinions rove  Than I forget my shepherd's wonted love  My plaint ye lasses with this burthen aid  'Tis hard so true a damsel dies a maid  Ah didst thou know what proffers I withstood  When late I met the squire in yonder wood  To me he sped regardless of his game  While all my cheek was glowing red with shame  My lip he kiss'd and prais'd my healthful look  Then from his purse of silk a guinea took  Into my hand he forc'd the tempting gold  While I with modest struggling broke his hold  He swore that Dick in liv'ry strip'd with lace  Should wed me soon to keep me from disgrace  But I nor footman priz'd nor golden fee  For what is lace or gold compar'd to thee  My plaint ye lasses with this burthen aid  'Tis hard so true a damsel dies a maid  Now plain I ken whence Love his rise begun  Sure he was born some bloody butcher's son  Bred up in shambles where our younglings slain  Erst taught him mischief and to sport with pain  The father only silly sheep annoys  The son the sillier shepherdess destroys  Does son or father greater mischief do  The fire is cruel so the son is too  My plaint ye lasses with this burthen aid  'Tis hard so true a damsel dies a maid  Farewel ye woods ye meads ye streams that flow  A sudden death shall rid me of my woe  This penknife keen my windpipe shall divide  What shall I fall as squeaking pigs have dy'd  NoTo some tree this carcase I'll suspend  But worrying curs find such untimely end  I'll speed me to the pond where the high stool  On the long plank hangs o'er the muddy pool  That stool the dread of every scolding quean  Yet sure a lover should not dye so mean  There plac'd aloft I'll rave and rail by fits  Though all the parish say I've lost my wits  And thence if courage holds myself I'll throw  And quench my passion in the lake below  Ye lasses ease your burthen cease to moan  And by my case forewarn'd go mind your own  The sun was set the night came on apace  And falling dews bewet around the place  The bat takes airy rounds on leathern wings  And the hoarse owl his woeful dirges sings  The prudent maiden deems it now too late  And till tomorrow comes defers her fate  THURSDAY OR THE SPELL  HOBNELIA  HOBNELIA seated in a dreary vale  In pensive mood rehears'd her piteous tale  Her piteous tale the winds in sighs bemoan  And pining eccho answers groan for groan  I rue the day a rueful day I trow  The woful day a day indeed of woe  When Lubberkin to town his cattle drove  A maiden fine bedight he happ'd to love  The maiden fine bedight his love retains  And for the village he forsakes the plains  Return my Lubberkin these ditties hear  Spells will I try and spells shall ease my care  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  When first the year I heard the cuckow sing  And call with welcome note the budding spring  I straitway set a running with such haste  Deb'rah that won the smock scarce ran so fast  'Till spent for lack of breath quite weary grown  Upon a rising bank I sat adown  Then doff'd my shoe and by my troth I swear  Therein I spy'd this yellow frizled hair  As like to Lubberkin's in curl and hue  As if upon his comely pate it grew  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  At eve last midsummer no sleep I sought  But to the field a bag of hempseed brought  I scattered round the seed on every side  And three times in a trembling accent cry'd  "This hempseed with my virgin hand I sow  "Who shall my truelove be the crop shall mow"  I strait look'd back and if my eyes speak truth  With his keen scythe behind me came the youth  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  Last Valentine the day when birds of kind  Their paramours with mutual chirpings find  I rearly rose just at the break of day  Before the sun had chas'd the stars away  Afield I went amid the morning dew  To milk my kine for so should huswives do  Thee first I spy'd and the first swain we see  In spite of fortune shall our truelove be  See Lubberkin each bird his partner take  And canst thou then thy sweetheart dear forsake  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  Last Mayday fair I search'd to find a snail  That might my secret lover's name reveal  Upon a gooseberry bush a snail I found  For always snails near sweetest fruit abound  I seiz'd the vermin home I quickly sped  And on the hearth the milkwhite embers spread  Slow crawl'd the snail and if I right can spell  In the soft ashes mark'd a curious L  Oh may this wond'rous omen lucky prove  For L is found in Lubberkin and Love  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  Two hazle nuts I threw into the flame  And to each nut I gave a sweetheart's name  This with the loudest bounce me sore amaz'd  That in a flame of brightest colour blaz'd  As blaz'd the nut so may thy passion grow  For 'twas thy nut that did so brightly glow  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  As peascods once I pluck'd I chanc'd to see  One that was closely fill'd with three times three  Which when I cropp'd I safely home convey'd  And o'er the door the spell in secret laid  My wheel I turn'd and sung a ballad new  While from the spindle I the fleeces drew  The latch mov'd up when who should first come in  But in his proper personLubberkin  I broke my yarn surpris'd the sight to see  Sure sign that he would break his word with me  Eftsoons I join'd it with my wonted slight  So may again his love with mine unite  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  This Ladyfly I take from off the grass  Whose spotted back might scarlet red surpass  "Fly Ladybird north south or east or west  "Fly where the man is found that I love best"  He leaves my hand see to the west he's flown  To call my truelove from the faithless town  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  I pare this pippin round and round again  My shepherd's name to flourish on the plain  I fling th' unbroken paring o'er my head  Upon the grass a perfect L is read  Yet on my heart a fairer L is seen  Than what the paring marks upon the green  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  This pippin shall another tryal make  See from the core two kernels brown I take  This on my cheek for Lubberkin is worn  And Boobyclod on t'other side is born  But Boobyclod soon drops upon the ground  A certain token that his love's unsound  While Lubberkin sticks firmly to the last  Oh were his lips to mine but join'd so fast  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  As Lubberkin once slept beneath a tree  I twitch'd his dangling garter from his knee  He wist not when the hempen string I drew  Now mine I quickly doff of inkle blue  Together fast I tye the garters twain  And while I knit the knot repeat the strain  "Three times a truelove's knot I tye secure  "Firm be the knot firm may his love endure"  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  As I was wont I trudg'd last marketday  To town with newlaid eggs preserv'd in hay  I made my market long before 'twas night  My purse grew heavy and my basket light  Strait to the 'pothecary's shop I went  And in lovepowder all my money spent  Behap what will next Sunday after prayers  When to the alehouse Lubberkin repairs  These golden flies into his mug I'll throw  And soon the swain with fervent love shall glow  With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground  And turn me thrice around around around  But hold our Lightfoot barks and cocks his ears  O'er yonder stile see Lubberkin appears  He comes he comes Hobnelia's not bewray'd  Nor shall she crown'd with willow die a maid  He vows he swears he'll give me a green gown  Oh dear I fall adown adown adown  FRIDAY OR THE DIRGE  BUMKINET GRUBBINOL  BUMKINET  WHY Grubbinol dost thou so wistful seem  There's sorrow in thy look if right I deem  'Tis true yon oaks with yellow tops appear  And chilly blasts begin to nip the year  From the tall elm a shower of leaves is born  And their lost beauty riven beeches mourn  Yet ev'n this season pleasance blith affords  Now the squeez'd press foams with our apple hoards  Come let us hye and quaff a cheary bowl  Let cyder now wash sorrow from thy soul  GRUBBINOL  Ah Bumkinet since thou from hence wert gone  From these sad plains all merriment is flown  Should I reveal my grief 'twould spoil thy chear  And make thine eye o'erflow with many a tear  BUMKINET  Hang sorrow Let's to yonder hut repair  And with trim sonnets cast away our care  Gillian of Croydon well thy pipe can play  Thou sing'st most sweet O'er hills and far away  Of Patient Grissel I devise to sing  And catches quaint shall make the vallies ring  Come Grubbinol beneath this shelter come  From hence we view our flocks securely roam  GRUBBINOL  Yes blithesome lad a tale I mean to sing  But with my woe shall distant vallies ring  The tale shall make our kidlings droop their head  For woe is meour Blouzelind is dead  BUMKINET  Is Blouzelinda dead farewel my glee  No happiness is now reserv'd for me  As the wood pigeon cooes without his mate  So shall my doleful dirge bewail her fate  Of Blouzelinda fair I mean to tell  The peerless maid that did all maids excel  Henceforth the morn shall dewy sorrow shed  And ev'ning tears upon the grass be spread  The rolling streams with wat'ry grief shall flow  And winds shall moan aloudwhen loud they blow  Henceforth as oft as autumn shall return  The dropping trees whene'er it rains shall mourn  This season quite shall strip the country's pride  For 'twas in Autumn Blouzelinda dy'd  Where'er I gad I Blouzelind shall view  Woods dairy barn and mows our passion knew  When I direct my eyes to yonder wood  Fresh rising sorrow curdles in my blood  Thither I've often been the damsel's guide  When rotten sticks our fuel have supply'd  There I remember how her faggots large  Were frequently these happy shoulders charge  Sometimes this crook drew hazel boughs adown  And stuff'd her apron wide with nuts so brown  Or when her feeding hogs had miss'd their way  Or wallowing 'mid a feast of acorns lay  Th' untoward creatures to the stye I drove  And whistled all the wayor told my love  If by the dairy's hatch I chance to hie  I shall her goodly countenance espy  For there her goodly countenance I've seen  Set off with kerchief starch'd and pinners clean  Sometimes like wax she rolls the butter round  Or with the wooden lilly prints the pound  Whilom I've seen her skim the clouted cream  And press from spongy curds the milky stream  But now alas these ears shall hear no more  The whining swine surround the dairy door  No more her care shall fill the hollow tray  To fat the guzzling hogs with floods of whey  Lament ye swine in gruntings spend your grief  For you like me have lost your sole relief  When in the barn the sounding flail I ply  Where from her sieve the chaff was wont to fly  The poultry there will seem around to stand  Waiting upon her charitable hand  No succour meet the poultry now can find  For they like me have lost their Blouzelind  Whenever by yon barley mow I pass  Before my eyes will trip the tidy lass  I pitch'd the sheaves oh could I do so now  Which she in rows pil'd on the growing mow  There every deale my heart by love was gain'd  There the sweet kiss my courtship has explain'd  Ah Blouzelind that mow I ne'er shall see  But thy memorial will revive in me  Lament ye fields and rueful symptoms show  Henceforth let not the smelling primrose grow  Let weeds instead of butterflowers appear  And meads instead of daisies hemlock bear  For cowslips sweet let dandelion spread  For Blouzelinda blithsome maid is dead  Lament ye swains and o'er her grave bemoan  And spell ye right this verse upon her stone  "Here Blouzelinda liesAlas alas  "Weep shepherdsand remember flesh is grass  GRUBBINOL  Albeit thy songs are sweeter to mine ear  Than to the thirsty cattle rivers clear  Or winter porridge to the lab'ring youth  Or buns and sugar to the damsel's tooth  Yet Blouzelinda's name shall tune my lay  Of her I'll sing for ever and for aye  When Blouzelind expir'd the weather's bell  Before the drooping flock toll'd forth her knell  The solemn deathwatch click'd the hour she dy'd  And chilling crickets in the chimney cry'd  The boding raven on her cottage sate  And with hoarse croaking warn'd us of her fate  The lambkin which her wonted tendance bred  Dropp'd on the plains that fatal instant dead  Swarm'd on a rotten stick the bees I spy'd  Which erst I saw when goody Dobson dy'd  How shall I void of tears her death relate  While on her darling's bed her mother sate  These words the dying Blouzelinda spoke  And of the dead let none the will revoke  "Mother" quoth she "let not the poultry need  And give the goose wherewith to raise her breed  Be these my sister's careand ev'ry morn  Amid the ducklings let her scatter corn  The sickly calf that's hous'd be sure to tend  Feed him with milk and from bleak colds defend  Yet e're I dieSee mother yonder shelf  There secretly I've hid my worldly pelf  Twenty good shillings in a rag I laid  Be ten the parson's for my sermon paid  The rest is your'smy spinningwheel and rake  Let Susan keep for her dear sister's sake  My new straw hat that's trimly lin'd with green  Let Peggy wear for she's a damsel clean  My leathern bottle long in harvests try'd  Be Grubbinol'sthis silver ring beside  Three silver pennies and a ninepence bent  A token kind to Bumkinet is sent"  Thus spoke the maiden while her mother cry'd  And peaceful like the harmless lamb she dy'd  To show their love the neibours far and near  Follow'd with wistful look the damsel's bier  Sprigg'd rosemary the lads and lasses bore  While dismally the parson walk'd before  Upon her grave the rosemary they threw  The daisie butterflower and endive blue  After the good man warn'd us from his text  That none could tell whose turn would be the next  He said that Heaven would take her soul no doubt  And spoke the hourglass in her praisequite out  To her sweet mem'ry flow'ry garlands strung  O'er her now empty seat aloft were hung  With wicker rods we fenc'd her tomb around  To ward from man and beast the hallow'd ground  Lest her new grave the parson's cattle raze  For both his horse and cow the churchyard graze  Now we trudg'd homeward to her mother's farm  To drink new cyder mull'd with ginger warm  For gaffer Treadwell told us by the by  Excessive sorrow is exceeding dry  While bulls bear horns upon their curled brow  Or lasses with soft stroakings milk the cow  While paddling ducks the standing lake desire  Or batt'ning hogs roll in the sinking mire  While moles the crumbled earth in hillocks raise  So long shall swains tell Blouzelinda's praise  Thus wail'd the louts in melancholy strain  'Till bonny Susan sped across the plain  They seiz'd the lass in apron clean array'd  And to the alehouse forc'd the willing maid  In ale and kisses they forget their cares  And Susan Blouzelinda's loss repairs  SATURDAY OR THE FLIGHTS  BOWZYBEUS  SUBLIMER strains O rustic muse prepare  Forget awhile the barn and dairy's care  Thy homely voice to loftier numbers raise  The drunkard's flights require sonorous lays  With Bowzybeus songs exalt thy verse  While rocks and woods the various notes rehearse  'Twas in the season when the reapers toil  Of the ripe harvest 'gan to rid the soil  Wide through the field was seen a goodly rout  Clean damsels bound the gather'd sheafs about  The lads with sharpen'd hook and sweating brow  Cut down the labours of the winter plow  To the near hedge young Susan steps aside  She feign'd her coat or garter was unty'd  Whate'er she did she stoop'd adown unseen  And merry reapers what they list will ween  Soon she rose up and cry'd with voice so shrill  That echo answer'd from the distant hill  The youths and damsels ran to Susan's aid  Who thought some adder had the lass dismay'd  When fast asleep they Bowzybeus spy'd  His hat and oaken staff lay close beside  That Bowzybeus who could sweetly sing  Or with the rosin'd bow torment the string  That Bowzybeus who with finger's speed  Could call soft warblings from the breathing reed  That Bowzybeus who with jocund tongue  Ballads and roundelays and catches sung  They loudly laugh to see the damsel's fright  And in disport surround the drunken wight  Ah Bowzybee why didst thou stay so long  The mugs were large the drink was wond'rous strong  Thou should'st have left the fair before 'twas night  But thou sat'st toping till the morning light  Cic'ly brisk maid steps forth before the rout  And kiss'd with smacking lip the snoring lout  For custom says "Whoe'er this venture proves  For such a kiss demands a pair of gloves"  By her example Dorcas bolder grows  And plays a tickling straw within his nose  He rubs his nostril and in wonted joke  The sneering swains with stamm'ring speech bespoke  "To you my lads I'll sing my carrols o'er  As for the maidsI've something else in store  No sooner 'gan he raise his tuneful song  But lads and lasses round about him throng  Not balladsinger plac'd above the crowd  Sings with a note so shrilling sweet and loud  Nor parishclerk who calls the psalm so clear  Like Bowzybeus sooths th' attentive ear  Of nature's laws his carols first begun  Why the grave owl can never face the sun  For owls as swains observe detest the light  And only sing and seek their prey by night  How turnips hide their swelling heads below  And how the closing colworts upwards grow  How WillaWisp misleads nightfaring clowns  O'er hills and sinking bogs and pathless downs  Of stars he told that shoot with shining trail  And of the glowworms light that gilds his tail  He sung where woodcocks in the summer feed  And in what climates they renew their breed  Some think to northern coasts their flight they tend  Or to the moon in midnight hours ascend  Where swallows in the winter's season keep  And how the drowsy bat and dormouse sleep  How nature does the puppy's eyelid close  Till the bright sun has nine times set and rose  For huntsmen by their long experience find  That puppies still nine rolling suns are blind  Now he goes on and sings of fairs and shows  For still new fairs before his eyes arose  How pedlars stalls with glitt'ring toys are laid  The various fairings of the countrymaid  Long silken laces hang upon the twine  And rows of pins and amber bracelets shine  How the tight lass knives combs and scissars spies  And looks on thimbles with desiring eyes  Of lott'ries next with tuneful note he told  Where silver spoons are won and rings of gold  The lads and lasses trudge the street along  And all the fair is crouded in his song  The mountebank now treads the stage and sells  His pills his balsams and his aguespells  Now o'er and o'er the nimble tumbler springs  And on the rope the vent'rous maiden swings  Jack Pudding in his partycolour'd jacket  Tosses the glove and jokes at every packet  Of Rareeshows he sung and Punch's feats  Of pockets pick'd in crowds and various cheats  Then sad he sung The Children in the Wood  Ah barb'rous uncle stain'd with infant blood  How blackberries they pluck'd in desarts wild  And fearless at the glittering fauchion smil'd  Their little corps the robinredbreasts found  And strew'd with pious bill the leaves around  Ah gentle birds if this verse lasts so long  Your names shall live for ever in my song  For buxom Joan he sung the doubtful strife  How the sly sailor made the maid a wife  To louder strains he rais'd his voice to tell  What woeful wars in Chevychace befel  When "Piercy drove the deer with hound and horn  Wars to be wept by children yet unborn"  Ah With'rington more years thy life had crown'd  If thou hadst never heard the horn or hound  Yet shall the 'squire who fought on bloody stumps  By future bards be wail'd in doleful dumps  All in the land of Essex next he chaunts  How to sleek mares starch Quakers turn gallants  How the grave brother stood on bank so green  Happy for him if mares had never been  Then he was seiz'd with a religious qualm  And on a sudden sung the hundredth psalm  He sung of Taffey Welch and Sawney Scot  Lillybullero and the Irish Trot  Why should I tell of Bateman or of Shore  Or Wantley's dragon slain by valiant Moore  The bower of Rosamond or Robin Hood  And how the grass now grows where Troy town stood  His carrols ceas'd the list'ning maids and swains  Seem still to hear some soft imperfect strains  Sudden he rose and as he reels along  Swears kisses sweet should well reward his song  The damsels laughing fly the giddy clown  Again upon a wheatsheaf drops adown  The pow'r that guards the drunk his sleep attends  Till ruddy like his face the sun descends  MAC FLECKNOE  The severity of this satire and the excellence of its versification give it a distinguished rank in this species of composition At present an ordinary reader would scarce suppose that Shadwell who is here meant by Mac Flecknoe was worth being chastised and that Dryden's descending to such game was like an eagle's stooping to catch flies The truth however is Shadwell at one time held divided reputation with this great poet Every age produces its fashionable dunces who by following the transient topic or humour of the day supply talkative ignorance with materials for conversation  ALL human things are subject to decay  And when Fate summons monarchs must obey  This Flecknoe found who like Augustus young  Was call'd to empire and had govern'd long  In prose and verse was own'd without dispute  Through all the realms of Nonsense absolute  This aged prince now flourishing in peace  And bless'd with issue of a large increase  Worn out with business did at length debate  To settle the succession of the state  And pond'ring which of all his sons was fit  To reign and wage immortal war with Wit  Cry'd 'Tis resolv'd for Nature pleads that he  Should only rule who most resembles me  Sh alone my perfect image bears  Mature in dulness from his tender years  Sh alone of all my sons was he  Who stands confirm'd in full stupidity  The rest to some faint meaning make pretence  But Sh never deviates into sense  Some beams of wit on other souls may fall  Strike through and make a lucid interval  But Sh's genuine night admits no ray  His rising fogs prevail upon the day  Besides his goodly fabric fills the eye  And seems design'd for thoughtless majesty  Thoughtless as monarch oaks that shade the plain  And spread in solemn state supinely reign  Heywood and Shirley were but types of thee  Thou last great prophet of Tautology  Ev'n I a dunce of more renown than they  Was sent before but to prepare thy way  And coarsely clad in Norwich drugget came  To teach the nations in thy greater name  My warbling lute the lute I whilom strung  When to king John of Portugal I sung  Was but the prelude to that glorious day  When thou on silver Thames didst cut thy way  With welltim'd oars before the royal barge  Swell'd with the pride of thy celestial charge  And big with hymn commander of an host  The like was ne'er in Epsom blankets tost  Methinks I see the new Arion sail  The lute still trembling underneath thy nail  At thy wellsharpen'd thumb from shore to shore  The trebles squeak for fear the bases roar  Echoes from PissingAlley Sh call  And Sh they resound from AstonHall  About thy boat the little fishes throng  As at the morning toast that floats along  Sometimes as prince of thy harmonious band  Thou wield'st thy papers in thy threshing hand  St Andre's feet ne'er kept more equal time  Not ev'n the feet of thy own Psyche's rhime  Though they in number as in sense excel  So just so like Tautology they fell  That pale with envy Singleton forswore  The lute and sword which he in triumph bore  And vow'd he ne'er wou'd act Villerius more  Here stopt the good old sire and wept for joy  In silent raptures of the hopeful boy  All arguments but most his plays persuade  That for anointed dulness he was made  Close to the walls which fair Augusta bind  The fair Augusta much to fears inclin'd  An antient fabric rais'd t' inform the sight  There stood of yore and Barbican it hight  A watchtow'r once but now so fate ordains  Of all the pile an empty name remains  From its old ruins brothelhouses rise  Scenes of lewd loves and of polluted joys  Where their vast courts the motherstrumpets keep  And undisturb'd by watch in silence sleep  Near these a nursery erects its head  Where queens are form'd and future heroes bred  Where unfledg'd actors learn to laugh and cry  Where infant punks their tender voices try  And little Maximins the Gods defy  Great Fletcher never treads in buskins here  Nor greater Johnson dares in socks appear  But gentle Simkin just reception finds  Amidst this monument of vanish'd minds  Pure clinches the suburbian muse affords  And Panton waging harmless war with words  Here Flecknoe as a place to fame well known  Ambitiously design'd his Sh's throne  For ancient Decker prophesy'd long since  That in this pile should reign a mighty prince  Born for a scourge of Wit and flail of sense  To whom true dulness should some Psyche's owe  But worlds of Misers from his pen should flow  Humourists and Hypocrites it should produce  Whole Raymond families and tribes of Bruce  Now empress Fame had publish'd the renown  Of Sh's coronation through the town  Rouz'd by report of Fame the nations meet  From near Bunhill and distant Watlingstreet  No Persian carpets spread th' imperial way  But scatter'd limbs of mangled poets lay  From dusty shops neglected authors come  Martyrs of pies and reliques of the bum  Much Heywood Shirley Ogleby there lay  But loads of Sh almost choak'd the way  Bilk'd Stationers for yeomen stood prepar'd  And Hn was captain of the guard  The hoary prince in majesty appear'd  High on a throne of his own labours rear'd  At his right hand our young Ascanius sate  Rome's other hope and pillar of the state  His brows thick fogs instead of glories grace  And lambent Dulness play'd around his face  As Hannibal did to the altars come  Swore by his sire a mortal foe to Rome  So Sh swore nor should his vow be vain  That he till death true dulness would maintain  And in his father's right and realm's defence  Ne'er to have peace with wit nor truce with sense  The king himself the sacred unction made  As king by office and as priest by trade  In his sinister hand instead of ball  He plac'd a mighty mug of potent ale  Love's kingdom to his right he did convey  At once his sceptre and his rule of sway  Whose righteous lore the prince had practis'd young  And from whose loins recorded Psyche sprung  His temples last with poppies were o'erspread  That nodding seem'd to consecrate his head  Just at the point of time if fame not lye  On his left hand twelve rev'rend owls did fly  So Romulus 'tis sung by Tyber's brook  Presage of sway from twice six vultures took  Th' admiring throng loud acclamations make  And omens of his future empire take  The sire then shook the honours of his head  And from his brows damps of oblivion shed  Full on the filial dullness long he stood  Repelling from his breast the raging god  At length burst out in this prophetic mood  "Heav'ns bless my son from Ireland let him reign  To far Barbadoes on the western main  Of his dominion may no end be known  And greater than his father's be his throne  Beyond Love's kingdom let him stretch his pen"  He paus'd and all the people cry'd Amen  Then thus continu'd he "My son advance  Still in new impudence new ignorance  Success let others teach learn thou from me  Pangs without birth and fruitless industry  Let Virtuoso's in five years be writ  Yet not one thought accuse thy toil of wit  Let gentle George in triumph tread the stage  Make Dorimant betray and Loveit rage  Let Cully Cockwood Fopling charm the pit  And in their folly shew the writer's wit  Yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence  And justify their author's want of sense  Let 'em be all by thy own model made  Of dulness and desire no foreign aid  That they to future ages may be known  Not copies drawn but issue of thy own  Nay let thy men of wit too be the same  All full of thee and diff'ring but in name  But let no alien Sdly interpose  To lard with wit thy hungry Epsom prose  And when false flowers of Rhetoric thou wouldst cull  Trust Nature do not labour to be dull  But write thy best and top and in each line  Sir Formal's oratory will be thine  Sir Formal tho' unsought attends thy quill  And does thy Northern Dedications fill  Nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame  By arrogating Johnson's hostile name  Let father Flecknoe fire thy mind with praise  And uncle Ogleby thy envy raise  Thou art my blood where Johnson has no part  What share have we in nature or in art  Where did his wit on Learning fix a brand  And rail at arts he did not understand  Where made he love in prince Nicander's vein  Or swept the dust in Psyche's humble strain  Where sold he bargains whipstitch kiss my arse  Promis'd a play and dwindled to a farce  When did his muse from Fletcher scenes purloin  As thou whole Eth'ridge dost transfuse to thine  But so transfus'd as oil and waters flow  His always floats above thine sinks below  This is thy province this thy wondrous way  New humours to invent for each new play  This is that boasted bias of thy mind  By which one way to dulness 'tis inclin'd  Which makes thy writings lean on one side still  And in all changes that way bends thy will  Nor let thy mountainbelly make pretence  Of likeness thine's a tympany of sense  A tun of man in thy large bulk is writ  But sure thou'rt but a kilderkin of wit  Like mine thy gentle numbers feebly creep  Thy tragic muse gives smiles thy comic sleep  With whate'er gall thou set'st thyself to write  Thy inoffensive satires never bite  In thy felonious heart though venom lies  It does but touch thy Irish pen and dies  Thy genius calls thee not to purchase fame  In keen Iambics but mild Anagram  Leave writing plays and chuse for thy command  Some peaceful province in Acrostic land  There thou may'st Wings display and Altars raise  And torture one poor word ten thousand ways  Or if thou woud'st thy different talents suit  Set thy own songs and sing them to thy lute"  He said but his last words were scarcely heard  For Bruce and Longvil had a trap prepar'd  And down they sent the yet declaiming bard  Sinking he left his drugget robe behind  Borne upwards by a subterranean wind  The mantle sell to the young prophet's part  With double portion of his father's art  ON POETRY A RHAPSODY  Here follows one of the best versified poems in our language and the most masterly production of its author The severity with which Walpole is here treated was in consequence of that minister's having refused to provide for Swift in England when applied to for that purpose in the year if I remember right The severity of a poet however gave Walpole very little uneasiness A man whose schemes like this minister's seldom extended beyond the exigency of the year but little regarded the contempt of posterity  ALL human race would fain be wits  And millions miss for one that hits  Young's universal passion pride  Was never known to spread so wide  Say Britain could you ever boast  Three poets in an age at most  Our chilling climate hardly bears  A sprig of bays in fifty years  While ev'ry fool his claim alledges  As if it grew in common hedges  What reason can there be assign'd  For this perverseness in the mind  Brutes find out where their talents lie  A bear will not attempt to fly  A founder'd horse will oft debate  Before he tries a fivebarr'd gate  A dog by instinct turns aside  Who sees the ditch too deep and wide  But man we find the only creature  Who led by folly combats nature  Who when she loudly cries forbear  With obstinacy fixes there  And where his genius least inclines  Absurdly bends his whole designs  Not empire to the rising sun  By valour conduct fortune won  Not highest wisdom in debates  For framing laws to govern states  Not skill in sciences profound  So large to grasp the circle round  Such heav'nly influence require  As how to strike the Muse's lyre  Not beggar's brat on bulk begot  Not bastard of a pedlar Scot  Not boy brought up to cleaning shoes  The spawn of Bridewell or the stews  Not infants dropt the spurious pledges  Of gipsies litt'ring under hedges  Are so disqualify'd by fate  To rise in church or law or state  As he whom Phoebus in his ire  Hath blasted with poetic fire  What hope of custom in the fair  While not a soul demands your ware  Where you have nothing to produce  For private life or public use  Court city country want you not  You cannot bribe betray or plot  For poets law makes no provision  The wealthy have you in derision  Of state affairs you cannot smatter  Are aukward when you try to flatter  Your portion taking Britain round  Was just one annual hundred pound  Now not so much as in remainder  Since Cibber brought in an attainder  For ever fix'd by right divine  A monarch's right on Grubstreet line  Poor starvling bard how small thy gains  How unproportion'd to thy pains  And here a simile comes pat in  Though chickens take a month to fatten  The guests in less than half an hour  Will more than half a score devour  So after toiling twenty days  To earn a stock of pence and praise  Thy labours grown the critic's prey  Are swallow'd o'er a dish of tea  Gone to be never heard of more  Gone where the chickens went before  How shall a new attempter learn  Of diff'rent spirits to discern  And how distinguish which is which  The poet's vein or scribbling itch  Then hear an old experienc'd sinner  Instructing thus a young beginner  Consult yourself and if you find  A powerful impulse urge your mind  Impartial judge within your breast  What subject you can manage best  Whether your genius most inclines  To satyre praise or hum'rous lines  To elegies in mournful tone  Or prologue sent from hand unknown  Then rising with Aurora's light  The muse invok'd sit down to write  Blot out correct insert refine  Enlarge diminish interline  Be mindful when invention fails  To scratch your head and bite your nails  Your poem finish'd next your care  Is needful to transcribe it fair  In modern wit all printed trash is  Set off with num'rous breaksand dashes  To statesmen would you give a wipe  You print it in Italic type  When letters are in vulgar shapes  'Tis ten to one the wit escapes  But when in capitals exprest  The dullest reader smokes the jest  Or else perhaps he may invent  A better than the poet meant  As learned commentators view  In Homer more than Homer knew  Your poem in its modish dress  Correctly fitted for the press  Convey by pennypost to Lintot  But let no friend alive look into't  If Lintot thinks 'twill quit the cost  You need not fear your labour lost  And how agreeably surpriz'd  Are you to see it advertiz'd  The hawker shews you one in print  As fresh as farthings from the mint  The product of your toil and sweating  A bastard of your own begetting  Be sure at Wills the following day  Lie snug and hear what critics say  And if you find the gen'ral vogue  Pronounces you a stupid rogue  Damns all your thoughts as low and little  Sit still and swallow down your spittle  Be silent as a politician  For talking may beget suspicion  Or praise the judgement of the town  And help yourself to run it down  Give up your fond paternal pride  Nor argue on the weaker side  For poems read without a name  We justly praise or justly blame  And critics have no partial views  Except they know whom they abuse  And since you ne'er provok'd their spight  Depend upon't their judgement's right  But if you blab you are undone  Consider what a risk you run  You lose your credit all at once  The town will mark you for a dunce  The vilest doggrel Grubstreet sends  Will pass for your's with foes and friends  And you must bear the whole disgrace  Till some fresh blockhead takes your place  Your secret kept your poem sunk  And sent in quires to line a trunk  If still you be dispos'd to rhime  Go try your hand a second time  Again you fail yet safe's the word  Take courage and attempt a third  But first with care employ your thoughts  Where critics mark'd your former faults  The trivial turns the borrow'd wit  The similies that nothing fit  The cant which ev'ry fool repeats  Town jests and coffeehouse conceits  Descriptions tedious flat and dry  And introduc'd the lord knows why  Or where we find your fury set  Against the harmless alphabet  On A's and B's your malice vent  While readers wonder whom you meant  A public or a private robber  A statesman or a Southsea jobber  A prelate who no God believes  A parliament or den of thieves  A pickpurse at the bar or bench  A duchess or a suburb wench  Or oft when epithets you link  In gaping lines to fill a chink  Like steppingstones to save a stride  In streets where kennels are too wide  Or like a heelpiece to support  A cripple with one foot too short  Or like a bridge that joins a marish  To moorlands of a diff'rent parish  So have I seen illcoupled hounds  Drag diff'rent ways in miry grounds  So geographers in Afric maps  With savage pictures fill their gaps  And o'er unhabitable downs  Place elephants for want of towns  But though you miss your third essay  You need not throw your pen away  Lay now aside all thoughts of fame  To spring more profitable game  From party merit seek support  The vilest verse thrives best at court  A pamphlet in Sir Bob's defence  Will never fail to bring in pence  Nor be concern'd about the sale  He pays his workmen on the nail  A prince the moment he is crown'd  Inherits every virtue round  As emblems of the sov'reign pow'r  Like other bawbles in the Tow'r  Is gen'rous valiant just and wise  And so continues till he dies  His humble senate this professes  In all their speeches votes addresses  But once you fix him in a tomb  His virtues fade his vices bloom  And each perfection wrong imputed  Is fully at his death confuted  The loads of poems in his praise  Ascending make one funeralblaze  As soon as you can hear his knell  This God on earth turns dl in hell  And lo his ministers of state  Transform'd to imps his levee wait  Where in the scenes of endless woe  They ply their former arts below  And as they sail in Charon's boat  Contrive to bribe the judge's vote  To Cerberus they give a fop  His tripplebarking mouth to stop  Or in the iv'ry gate of dreams  Project Excise and Southsea schemes  Or hire their partypamphleteers  To set Elysium by the ears  Then poet if you mean to thrive  Employ your muse on kings alive  With prudence gathering up a cluster  Of all the virtues you can muster  Which form'd into a garland sweet  Lay humbly at your monarch's feet  Who as the odours reach his throne  Will smile and think 'em all his own  For law and gospel both determine  All virtues lodge in royal ermine  I mean the oracles of both  Who shall depose it upon oath  Your garland in the following reign  Change but the names will do again  But if you think this trade too base  Which seldom is the dunce's case  Put on the critic's brow and sit  At Will's the puny judge of wit  A nod a shrug a scornful smile  With caution us'd may serve awhile  Proceed no further in your part  Before you learn the terms of art  For you can ne'er be too far gone  In all our modern critics jargon  Then talk with more authentic face  Of unities in time and place  Get scraps of Horace from your friends  And have them at your fingers ends  Learn Aristotle's rules by rote  And at all hazards boldly quote  Judicious Rymer oft review  Wise Dennis and profound Bossu  Read all the prefaces of Dryden  For these our critics much confide in  Though merely writ at first for filling  To raise the volume's price a shilling  A forward critic often dupes us  With sham quotations peri hupsous  And if we have not read Longinus  Will magisterially outshine us  Then lest with Greek he overrun ye  Procure the book for love or money  Translated from Boileau's translation  And quote quotation on quotation  At Will's you hear a poem read  Where Battus from the tablehead  Reclining on his elbowchair  Gives judgement with decisive air  To whom the tribe of circling wits  As to an oracle submits  He gives directions to the town  To cry it up or run it down  Like courtiers when they send a note  Instructing members how to vote  He sets the stamp of bad and good  Though not a word be understood  Your lesson learnt you'll be secure  To get the name of connoisseur  And when your merits once are known  Procure disciples of your own  For poets you can never want 'em  Spread through  The ancient name of London  Augusta Trinobantum  Computing by their pecks of coals  Amount to just nine thousand souls  These o'er their proper districts govern  Of wit and humour judges sov'reign  In ev'ry street a citybard  Rules like an alderman his ward  His indisputed rights extend  Through all the lane from end to end  The neighbours round admire his shrewdness  For songs of loyalty and lewdness  Outdone by none in rhiming well  Although he never learnt to spell  Two bordering wits contend for glory  And one is Whig and one is Tory  And this for epics claims the bays  And that for elegiac lays  Some fam'd for numbers soft and smooth  By lovers spoke in Punch's booth  And some as justly fame extols  For lofty lines in Smithfield drolls  Bavius in Wapping gains renown  And Maevius reigns o'er Kentishtown  Tigellius plac'd in Phoebus' car  From Ludgate shines to Templebar  Harmonious Cibber entertains  The court with annual birthday strains  Whence Gay was banish'd in disgrace  Where Pope will never show his face  Where Yg must torture his invention  To flatter knaves or lose his pension  But these are not a thousandth part  Of jobbers in the poet's art  Attending each his proper station  And all in due subordination  Through ev'ry alley to be found  In garrets high or under ground  And when they join their pericranies  Out skips a book of miscellanies  Hobbes clearly proves that ev'ry creature  Lives in a state of war by nature  The greater for the smallest watch  But meddle seldom with their match  A whale of mod'rate size will draw  A shoal of herrings down his maw  A fox with geese his belly crams  A wolf destroys a thousand lambs  But search among the rhiming race  The brave are worried by the base  If on Parnassus' top you sit  You rarely bite are always bit  Each poet of inferior size  On you shall rail and criticise  And strive to tear you limb from limb  While others do as much for him  The vermin only teaze and pinch  Their foes superior by an inch  So nat'ralists observe a flea  Hath smaller fleas that on him prey  And these have smaller still to bite 'em  And so proceed  ad infinitum  Thus ev'ry poet in his kind  Is bit by him that comes behind  Who though too little to be seen  Can tease and gall and give the spleen  Call dunces fools and sons of whores  Lay Grubstreet at each other's doors  Extol the Greek and Roman masters  And curse our modern poetasters  Complain as many an ancient bard did  How genius is no more rewarded  How wrong a taste prevails among us  How much our ancestors outsung us  Can personate an aukward scorn  For those who are not poets born  And all their brother dunces lash  Who croud the press with hourly trash  Oh Grubstreet how do I bemoan thee  Whose graceless children scorn to own thee  Their filial piety forgot  Deny their country like a Scot  Though by their idiom and grimace  They soon betray their native place  Yet thou hast greater cause to be  Asham'd of them than they of thee  Degenerate from their ancient brood  Since first the court allow'd them food  Remains a difficulty still  To purchase fame by writing ill  From Flecknoe down to Howard's time  How few have reach'd the low sublime  For when our highborn Howard died  Blackmore alone his place supplied  And lest a chasm should intervene  When death had finish'd Blackmore's reign  The leaden crown devolv'd to thee  Great  Lord Grimstone author of a play called Love in an Hollow Tree  poet of the Hollowtree  But ah how unsecure thy throne  A thousand bards thy right disown  They plot to turn in factious zeal  Duncinea to a commonweal  And with rebellious arms pretend  An equal priv'lege to descend  In bulk there are not more degrees  From elephants to mites in cheese  Than what a curious eye may trace  In creatures of the rhiming race  From bad to worse and worse they fall  But who can reach the worst of all  For though in nature depth and height  Are equally held infinite  In poetry the height we know  'Tis only infinite below  For

 Smart Jemmy Moor with vigour drops  The rest pursue as thick as hops  With heads to points the gulph they enter  Link'd perpendicular to the center  And as their heels elated rise  Their heads

conveyances of his real estate to his brother and son and concealed all his personal which was computed to be l These conveyances being also set aside by a bill in Chancery Ward was imprisoned and hazarded the forfeiture of his life by not giving in his effects till the last day which was that of his examination During his confinement his amusement was to give poison to dogs and cats and see

interest and on great penalties accumulating praemium interest and capital into a new capital and seizing to a minute when the payments became due In a word by a constant attention to the vices wants and follies of mankind he acquired an immense fortune His house was a perpetual bawdyhouse He was twice condemned for rapes and pardoned but the last time not without imprisonment in Newgate and large confiscations He died in Scotland in aged The populace at his funeral raised a great riot almost tore the body out of the coffin and cast dead dogs c into the grave along with it The following epitaph

Vitruvius was before  Till Kings call forth th' ideas of your mind  The poet after having touched upon the proper objects of magnificence and expence in the private works of great men comes to those great and public works which become a prince This poem was published at the time when some of the new churches built by the act of queen Anne were ready to fall being founded on boggy land and others vilely executed through fraudulent cabals between undertakers officers c when Dagenhambreach had done very great mischiefs when the proposal of building a bridge at Westminster had been petitioned against and rejected when many of the highways throughout England were hardly passable and most of those which were repaired by turnpikes made jobbs for private lucre and infamously executed even to the entrances of London itself At this time there had been an uninterrupted peace in Europe for above twenty years    Proud to accomplish what such hands design'd  Bid Harbours open public Ways extend  Bid Temples worthier of the God ascend  Bid the broad Arch the dang'rous Flood contain  The Mole projected break the roaring Main  Back to his bounds their subject sea command  And roll obedient Rivers thro' the Land  These Honours Peace to happy Britain brings  These are Imperial Works and worthy Kings  FROM THE DISPENSARY CANTO VI  This sixth canto of the Dispensary by Dr Garth has more merit than the whole preceding part of the poem and as I am told in the first edition of this work it is more correct than as here exhibited but that edition I have not been able to find The praises bestowed on this poem are more than have been given to any other but our approbation at present is cooler for it owed part of its fame to party  AND now the Delegate prepares to go  And view the wonders of the realms below  Thrice did the goddess with her sacred wand  The pavement strike and strait at her command  The willing surface opens and descries  A deep descent that leads to nether skies  Hygeia to the silent region tends  And with his heav'nly guide the Charge descends  Thus Numa when to hallow'd caves retir'd  Was by Aegeria guarded and inspir'd  Within the chambers of the globe they spy  The beds where sleeping vegetables lie  Till the glad summons of a genial ray  Unbinds the glebe and calls them out to day  Hence Pancies trick themselves in various hue  And hence Junquils derive their fragrant dew  Hence the Carnation and the bashful Rose  Their virgin blushes to the morn disclose  Hence the chaste Lilly rises to the light  Unveils her snowy breasts and charms the sight  Hence arbours are with twining greens array'd  T'oblige complaining lovers with their shade  And hence on Daphne's laurel'd forehead grow  Immortal wreaths for Phoebus and Nassau  The insects here their ling'ring trance survive  Benumb'd they seem and doubtful if alive  From Winter's fury hither they repair  And stay for milder skies and softer air  Down to these cells obscener reptiles creep  Where hateful Nutes and painted Lizzards sleep  Where shiv'ring Snakes the summer Solstice wait  Unfurl their painted folds and slide in state  Here their new form the numb'd Erucae hide  Their num'rous feet in slender bandage ty'd  Soon as the kindling year begins to rise  This upstart race their native clod despise  And proud of painted wings attempt the skies  Now those profounder regions they explore  Where metals ripen in vast cakes of oar  Here sullen to the sight at large is spread  The dull unwieldy mass of lumpish Lead  There glimm'ring in their dawning beds are seen  The aspiring seeds of sprightly Tin  The Copper sparkles next in ruddy streaks  And in the gloom betrays its glowing cheeks  The Silver then with bright and burnish'd grace  Youth and a blooming lustre in its face  To th' arms of those more yielding metals flies  And in the folds of their embraces lies  So close they cling so stubbornly retire  Their love's more vi'lent than the chymist's fire  Near these the Delegate with wonder spies  Where floods of living silver serpentize  Where richest metals their bright looks put on  And golden streams through amber channels run  Where Light's gay God descends to ripen gems  And lend a lustre brighter than his beams  Here he observes the subterranean cells  Where wanton nature sports in idle shells  Some helicoeids some conical appear  These mitres emulate those turbans are  Here marcasites in various figure wait  To ripen to a true metallic state  Till drops that from impending rocks descend  Their substance petrify and progress end  Nigh livid seas of kindled sulphur flow  And whilst enraged their fiery surges glow  Convulsions in the lab'ring mountains rise  And hurl their melted vitals to the skies  He views with horror next the noisy cave  Where with hoarse dinns imprison'd tempests rave  Where clam'rous hurricanes attempt their flight  Or whirling in tumultuous eddies fight  The warring winds unmov'd Hygeia heard  Brav'd their loud jars but much for Celsus fear'd  Andromeda so whilst her hero fought  Shook for his danger but her own forgot  And now the goddess with her charge descends  Where scarce one chearful glimpse their steps befriends  Here his forsaken seat old Chaos keeps  And undisturb'd by Form in silence sleeps  A grisly wight and hideous to the eye  An aukward lump of shapeless anarchy  With sordid age his features are defac'd  His lands unpeopled and his countries waste  To these dark realms much learned lumber creeps  There copious M safe in silence sleeps  Where mushroom libels in oblivion lie  And soon as born like other monsters die  Upon a couch of jett in these abodes  Dull Night his melancholy consort nods  No ways and means their cabinet employ  But their dark hours they waste in barren joy  Nigh this recess with terror they survey  Where Death maintains his dread tyrannic sway  In the close covert of a cypress grove  Where goblins frisk and airy spectres rove  Yawns a dark cave with awful horror wide  And there the monarch's triumphs are descry'd  Confus'd and wildly huddled to the eye  The beggar's pouch and prince's purple lie  Dim lamps with sickly rays scarce seem to glow  Sighs heave in mournful moans and tears o'erflow  Restless Anxiety forlorn Despair  And all the faded family of Care  Old mould'ring urns racks daggers and distress  Make up the frightful horror o' the place  Within its dreadful jaws those furies wait  Which execute the harsh decrees of Fate  Febris is first the hag relentless hears  The virgin's sighs and sees the infant's tears  In her parch'd eyeballs fiery meteors reign  And restless ferments revel in each vein  Then hydrops next appears amongst the throng  Bloated and big she slowly sails along  But like a miser in excess she's poor  And pines for thirst amidst her watry store  Now loathsome Lepra that offensive spright  With foul eruptions stain'd offends the sight  Still deaf to beauty's soft persuading pow'r  Nor can bright Hebe's charms her bloom secure  Whilst meager Pthisis gives a silent blow  Her strokes are sure but her advances slow  No loud alarms or fierce assaults are shown  She starves the fortress first then takes the town  Behind stood crowds of much inferior name  Too numerous to repeat too foul to name  The vassals of their monarch's tyranny  Who at his nod on fatal errands fly  Now Celsus with his glorious guide invades  The silent region of the fleeting shades  Where rocks and ruful desarts are descry'd  And sullen Styx rolls down his lazy tide  Then shews the ferryman the plant he bore  And claims his passage to the further shore  To whom the Stygian pilot smiling said  You need no passport to demand our aid  Physicians never linger on this strand  Old Charon's present still at their command  Our awful monarch and his consort owe  To them the peopling of their realms below  Then in his swarthy hand he grasp'd the oar  Receiv'd his guests aboard and shov'd from shore  Now as the goddess and her charge prepare  To breathe the sweets of soft Elysian air  Upon the left they spy a pensive shade  Who on his bended arm had rais'd his head  Pale Grief sate heavy on his mournful look  To whom not unconcern'd thus Celsus spoke  Tell me thou much afflicted shade why sighs  Burst from your breast and torrents from your eyes  And who those mangled manes are which show  A sullen satisfaction at your woe  Since said the ghost with pity you'll attend  Know I'm Guâicum once your firmest friend  And on this barren beach in discontent  Am doom'd to stay 'till th' angry powers relent  Those spectres seam'd with scars that threaten there  The victims of my late ill conduct are  They vex with endless clamours my repose  This wants his palate that demands his nose  And here they execute stern Pluto's will  And ply me ev'ry moment with a pill  Then Celsus thus O muchlamented state  How rigid is the sentence you relate  Methinks I recollect your former air  But ah how much you're chang'd from what you were  Insipid as your late ptisans you lie  That once were sprightlier far than Mercury  At the sad tale you tell the poppies weep  And mourn their vegetable souls asleep  The unctuous Larix and the healing Pine  Lament your fate in tears of Turpentine  But still the offspring of your brain shall prove  The grocer's care and brave the rage of Jove  When bonfires blaze your vagrant works shall rise  In rockets till they reach the wond'ring skies  If mortals e'er the Stygian pow'rs could bend  Entreaties to their awful seats I'd send  But since no human arts the Fates dissuade  Direct me how to find bless'd Hervey's shade  In vain th' unhappy ghost still urg'd his stay  Then rising from the ground he shew'd the way  Nigh the dull shore a shapeless mountain stood  That with a dreadful frown survey'd the flood  Its fearful brow no lively greens put on  No frisking goats bound o'er the ridgy stone  To gain the summit the bright goddess try'd  And Celsus follow'd by degrees his guide  Th' ascent thus conquer'd now they towre on high  And taste th' indulgence of a milder sky  Loose breezes on their airy pinions play  Soft infant blossoms their chaste odours pay  And roses blush their fragrant lives away  Cool streams thro' flow'ry meadows gently glide  And as they pass their painted banks they chide  These blissful plains no blights nor mildews fear  The flow'rs ne'er fade and shrubs are myrtles here  The morn awakes the tulip from her bed  E'er noon in painted pride she decks her head  Rob'd in rich dye she triumphs on the green  And ev'ry flow'r does homage to their queen  So when bright Venus rises from the flood  Around in throngs the wond'ring Nereids crowd  The Tritons gaze and tune each vocal shell  And ev'ry grace unsung the waves conceal  The Delegate observes with wond'ring eyes  Ambrosial dews descend and incense rise  Then hastens onward to the pensive grove  The silent mansion of disastrous love  Here Jealousy with jaundice looks appears  And broken slumbers and fantastic fears  The widow'd Turtle hangs her moulting wings  And to the woods in mournful murmurs sings  No winds but sighs there are no floods but tears  Each conscious tree a tragic signal bears  Their wounded bark records some broken vow  And willow garlands hang on ev'ry bough  Olivia here in solitude he found  Her downcast eyes fix'd on the silent ground  Her dress neglected and unbound her hair  She seem'd the dying image of despair  How lately did this celebrated thing  Blaze in the box and sparkle in the ring  Till the Greensickness and Love's force betray'd  To Death's remorseless arms th' unhappy maid  All o'er confus'd the guilty lover stood  The light forsook his eyes his cheeks the blood  An icy horror shiver'd in his look  As to the coldcomplexion'd nymph he spoke  "Tell me dear shade from whence such anxious care  Your looks disorder'd and your bosom bare  Why thus you languish like a drooping flow'r  Crush'd by the weight of some relentless show'r  Your languid looks your late illconduct tell  O that instead of trash you'd taken steel"  Stabb'd with th' unkind reproach the conscious maid  Thus to her late insulting lover said  "When ladies listen not to loose desire  You stile our modesty our want of fire  Smile or forbid encourage or reprove  You still find reasons to believe we love  Vainly you think a liking we betray  And never mean the peevish things we say  Few are the fair ones of Rufilla's make  Unask'd she grants uninjur'd she'll forsake  But sev'ral Caelia's sev'ral ages boast  That like where Reason recommends the most  Where heav'nly truth and tenderness conspire  Chaste passion may perswade us to desire"  "Your sex he cry'd as custom bids behaves  In forms the tyrant tyes such haughty slaves  To do nice Conduct right you Nature wrong  Impulses are but weak where Reason's strong  Some want the courage but how few the flame  They like the thing that startle at the name  The lonely Phoenix tho' profess'd a nun  Warms into love and kindles at the sun  Those tales of spicy urns and fragrant fires  Are but the emblems of her scorch'd desires"  Then as he strove to clasp the fleeting fair  His empty arms confess'd th' impassive air  From his embrace th'unbody'd spectre flies  And as she mov'd she chid him with her eyes  They hasten now to that delightful plain  Where the glad manes of the bless'd remain  Where Hervey gathers simples to bestow  Immortal youth on heroes shades below  Soon as the bright Hygeia was in view  The venerable sage her presence knew  Thus he  Hail blooming goddess thou propitious pow'r  Whose blessings mortals more than life implore  With so much lustre your bright looks endear  That cottages are courts where those appear  Mankind as you vouchsafe to smile or frown  Finds ease in chains or anguish in a crown  With just resentments and contempt you see  The foul dissentions of the Faculty  How your sad sick'ning art now hangs her head  And once a science is become a trade  Her sons ne'er rifle her mysterious store  But study Nature less and lucre more  Not so when Rome to th' Epidaurian rais'd  A temple where devoted incense blaz'd  Oft father Tyber views the lofty fire  As the learn'd son is worshipp'd like the fire  The sage with Romulus like honours claim  The gift of life and laws were then the same  I show'd of old how vital currents glide  And the meanders of their refluent tide  Then Willis why spontaneous actions here  And whence involuntary motions there  And how the spirits by mechanic laws  In wild careers tumultuous riots cause  Nor wou'd our Wharton Bates and Glisson lie  In the abyss of blind Obscurity  But now such wond'rous searches are forborne  And Paean's art is by divisions torn  Then let your Charge attend and I'll explain  How her lost health your science may regain  Haste and the matchless Atticus address  From Heav'n and great Nassau he has the mace  Th' oppress'd to his asylum still repair  Arts he supports and Learning is his care  He softens the harsh rigour of the laws  Blunts their keen edge and grinds their harpy claws  And graciously he casts a pitying eye  On the sad state of virtuous poverty  When e'er he speaks Heav'ns how the list'ning throng  Dwells on the melting music of his tongue  His arguments are emblems of his mien  Mild but not faint and forcing tho' serene  And when the pow'r of eloquence he'd try  Here light'ning strikes you there soft breezes sigh  To him you must your sickly state refer  Your charter claims him as your Visiter  Your wounds he'll close and sov'reignly restore  Your science to the height it had before  Then Nassau's health shall be your glorious aim  His life should be as lasting as his fame  Some princes claims from devastations spring  He condescends in pity to be king  And when amidst his olives plac'd he stands  And governs more by candour than commands  Ev'n then not less a hero he appears  Than when a Laurel diadem he wears  Wou'd Phoebus or his Gle but inspire  Their sacred veh'mence of poetic sire  To celebrate in song that godlike pow'r  Which did the lab'ring universe restore  Fair Albion's cliffs would echo to the strain  And praise the arm that conquer'd to regain  The earth's repose and empire o'er the main  Still may th' immortal man his cares repeat  To make his blessings endless as they're great  Whilst Malice and Ingratitude confess  They've strove for ruin long without success  When late Jove's eagle from the pyle shall rise  To bear the victor to the boundless skies  Awhile the God puts off paternal care  Neglects the earth to give the Heav'ns a star  Near thee Alcides shall the hero shine  His rays resembling as his labours thine  Had some fam'd patriot of the Latin blood  Like Julius great and like Octavius good  But thus preserv'd the Latin liberties  Aspiring columns soon had reach'd the skies  Loud Io's the proud capitol had shook  And all the statues of the gods had spoke  No more the sage his raptures could pursue  He paus'd and Celsus with his guide withdrew  ECLOGUE I SELIM OR THE SHEPHERD'S MORAL SCENE A VALLEY NEAR BAGDAT TIME THE MORNING  The following eclogues written by Mr Collins are very pretty the images it must be owned are not very local for the pastoral subject could not well admit of it The description of Asiatic magnificence and manners is a subject as yet unattempted amongst us and I believe capable of furnishing a great variety of poetical imagery  YE Persian maids attend your poet's lays  And hear how shepherds pass their golden days  Not all are blest whom Fortune's hand sustains  With wealth in courts nor all that haunt the plains  Well may your hearts believe the truths I tell  'Tis virtue makes the bliss where'er we dwell  Thus Selim sung by sacred Truth inspir'd  Nor praise but such as Truth bestow'd desir'd  Wise in himself his meaning songs convey'd  Informing morals to the shepherd maid  Or taught the swains that surest bliss to find  What groves nor streams bestow a virtuous mind  When sweet and blushing like a virgin bride  The radiant morn resum'd her orient pride  When wanton gales along the valleys play  Breathe on each flower and bear their sweets away  By Tigris' wandering waves he sat and sung  This useful lesson for the fair and young  Ye Persian dames he said to you belong  Well may they please the morals of my song  No fairer maids I trust than you are found  Grac'd with soft arts the peopled world around  The morn that lights you to your loves supplies  Each gentler ray delicious to your eyes  For you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow  And yours the love that kings delight to know  Yet think not these allbeauteous as they are  The best kind blessings Heaven can grant the fair  Who trust alone in beauty's feeble ray  Boast but the worth Bassora's pearls display  Drawn from the deep we own their surface bright  But dark within they drink no lustrous light  Such are the maids and such the charms they boast  By sense unaided or to virtue lost  Selfflattering sex your hearts believe in vain  That love shall blind whence once he fires the swain  Or hope a lover by your faults to win  As spots on ermin beautify the skin  Who seeks secure to rule be first her care  Each softer virtue that adorns the fair  Each tender passion man delights to find  The lov'd perfections of a female mind  Blest were the days when Wisdom held her reign  And shepherds sought her on the silent plain  With Truth she wedded in the secret grove  Immortal Truth and daughters bless'd their love  O haste fair maids ye Virtues come away  Sweet Seace and Plenty lead you on your way  The balmy shrub for you shall love our shore  By Ind excell'd or Araby no more  Lost to our fields for so the fates ordain  The dear deserters shall return again  Come thou whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear  To lead the train sweet Modesty appear  Here make thy court amidst our rural scene  And shepherdgirls shall own thee for their queen  With thee be Chastity of all afraid  Distrusting all a wise suspicious maid  But man the mostnot more the mountain doe  Holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe  Cold is her breast like flowers that drink the dew  A silken veil conceals her from the view  No wild desires amidst thy train be known  But Faith whose heart is fix'd on one alone  Desponding Meekness with her downcast eyes  And friendly Pity full of tender sighs  And Love the last by these your hearts approve  These are the virtues that must lead to love  Thus sung the swain and antient legends say  The maids of Bagdat verified the lay  Dear to the plains the Virtues came along  The shepherds lov'd and Selim bless'd his song  ECLOGUE II HASSAN OR THE CAMELDRIVER SCENE THE DESERT TIME MIDDAY  IN silent horror o'er the boundless waste  The driver Hassan with his camels past  One cruise of water on his back he bore  And his light scrip contain'd a scanty store  A fan of painted feathers in his hand  To guard his shaded face from scorching sand  The sultry sun had gain'd the middle sky  And not a tree and not an herb was nigh  The beasts with pain their dusty way pursue  Shrill roar'd the winds and dreary was the view  With desperate sorrow wild th' affrighted man  Thrice sigh'd thrice struck his breast and thus began  "Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  Ah little thought I of the blasting wind  The thirst or pinching hunger that I find  Bethink thee Hassan where shall Thirst asswage  When fails this cruise his unrelenting rage  Soon shall this scrip its precious load resign  Then what but tears and hunger shall be thine  Ye mute companions of my toils that bear  In all my griefs a more than equal share  Here where no springs in murmurs break away  Or mosscrown'd fountains mitigate the day  In vain ye hope the green delights to know  Which plains more blest or verdant vales bestow  Here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found  And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around  "Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  Curst be the gold and silver which persuade  Weak men to follow farfatiguing trade  The lilly peace outshines the silver store  And life is dearer than the golden ore  Yet money tempts us o'er the desert brown  To every distant mart and wealthy town  Full oft we tempt the land and oft the sea  And are we only yet repair'd by thee  Ah why was ruin so attractive made  Or why fond man so easily betray'd  Why heed we not while mad we haste along  The gentle voice of Peace or Pleasure's song  Or wherefore think the flowery mountain's side  The fountain's murmurs and the valley's pride  Why think we these less pleasing to behold  Than dreary deserts if they lead to gold  "Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  O cease my fearsall frantic as I go  When thought creates unnumber'd scenes of woe  What if the lion in his rage I meet  Oft in the dust I view his printed feet  And fearful oft when day's declining light  Yields her pale empire to the mourner night  By hunger rous'd he scours the groaning plain  Gaunt wolves and sullen tygers in his train  Before them death with shrieks directs their way  Fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey  "Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  At that dead hour the silent asp shall creep  If aught of rest I find upon my sleep  Or some swol'n serpent twist his scales around  And wake to anguish with a burning wound  Thrice happy they the wise contented poor  From lust of wealth and dread of death secure  They tempt no deserts and no griefs they find  Peace rules the day where Reason rules the mind  "Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  O hapless youth for she thy love hath won  The tender Zara will be most undone  Big swell'd my heart and own'd the powerful maid  When fast she dropt her tears as thus she said  "Farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain  Whom Zara's breaking heart implor'd in vain  Yet as thou go'st may ev'ry blast arise  Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs  Safe o'er the wild no perils may'st thou see  No griefs endure nor weep false youth like me"  O let me safely to the fair return  Say with a kiss she must not shall not mourn  O let me teach my heart to lose its fears  Recall'd by Wisdom's voice and Zara's tears  He said and call'd on Heav'n to bless the day  When back to Schiraz' walls he bent his way  ECLOGUE III ABRA OR THE GEORGIAN SULTANA SCENE A FOREST TIME THE EVENING  IN Georgia's land where Tefflis' towers are seen  In distant view along the level green  While evening dews enrich the glittering glade  And the tall forests cast a longer shade  What time 'tis sweet o'er fields of rice to stray  Or scent the breathing maize at setting day  Amidst the maids of Zagen's peaceful grove  Emyra sung the pleasing cares of love  Of Abra first began the tender strain  Who led her youth with flocks upon the plain  At morn she came those willing flocks to lead  Where lillies rear them in the watery mead  From early dawn the livelong hours she told  Till late at silent eve she penn'd the fold  Deep in the grove beneath the secret shade  A various wreath of odorous flowers she made  That these flowers are found in very great abundance in some of the provinces of Persia see the Modern History of Mr Salmon  Gaymotley'd pinks and sweet jonquils she chose  The violet blue that on the mossbank grows  All sweet to sense the flaunting rose was there  The finish'd chaplet well adorn'd her hair  Great Abbas chanc'd that fated morn to stray  By love conducted from the chace away  Among the vocal vales he heard her song  And sought the vales and echoing groves among  At length he found and woo'd the rural maid  She knew the monarch and with fear obey'd  "Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd  The royal lover bore her from the plain  Yet still her crook and bleating flock remain  Oft as she went she backward turn'd her view  And bad that crook and bleating flock adieu  Fair happy maid to other scenes remove  To richer scenes of golden power and love  Go leave the simple pipe and shepherd's strain  With love delight thee and with Abbas reign  "Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  And ev'ry Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  Yet midst the blaze of courts she fix'd her love  On the cool fountain or the shady grove  Still with the shepherd's innocence her mind  To the sweet vale and flowery mead inclin'd  And oft as spring renew'd the plains with flowers  Breath'd his soft gales and led the fragrant hours  With sure return she sought the sylvan scene  The breezy mountains and the forests green  Her maids around her mov'd a duteous band  Each bore a crook allrural in her hand  Some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung  With joy the mountain and the forest rung  "Be ev'ry youth like royal Abbas mov'd  And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  And oft the royal lover left the care  And thorns of state attendant on the fair  Oft to the shades and lowroof'd cots retir'd  Or sought the vale where first his heart was fir'd  A russet mantle like a swain he wore  And thought of crowns and busy courts no more  "Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  Blest was the life that royal Abbas led  Sweet was his love and innocent his bed  What if in wealth the noble maid excel  The simple shepherd girl can love as well  Let those who rule on Persia's jewell'd throne  Be fam'd for love and gentlest love alone  Or wreathe like Abbas full of fair renown  The lover's myrtle with the warrior's crown  O happy days the maids around her say  O haste profuse of blessings haste away  "Be ev'ry youth like royal Abbas mov'd  And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  ECLOGUE IV AGIB AND SECANDER OR THE FUGITIVES SCENE A MOUNTAIN IN CIRCASSIA TIME MIDNIGHT  IN fair Circassia where to love inclin'd  Each swain was bless'd for ev'ry maid was kind  At that still hour when awful midnight reigns  And none but wretches haunt the twilight plains  What time the moon had hung her lamp on high  And past in radiance thro' the cloudless sky  Sad o'er the dews two brother shepherds fled  Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led  Fast as they press'd their flight behind them lay  Wide ravag'd plains and vallies stole away  Along the mountain's bending sides they ran  Till faint and weak Secander thus began  SECANDER  O stay thee Agib for my feet deny  No longer friendly to my life to fly  Friend of my heart O turn thee and survey  Trace our sad slight thro' all its length of way  And first review that longextended plain  And yon wide groves already past with pain  Yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we try'd  And last this lofty mountain's weary side  AGIB  Weak as thou art yet hapless must thou know  The toils of flight or some severer woe  Still as I haste the Tartar shouts behind  And shrieks and sorrows load the saddening wind  In rage of heart with ruin in his hand  He blasts our harvests and deforms our land  Yon citron grove whence first in fear we came  Droops its fair honours to the conquering flame  Far fly the swains like us in deep despair  And leave to ruffian bands their fleecy care  SECANDER  Unhappy land whose blessings tempt the sword  In vain unheard thou call'st thy Persian lord  In vain thou court'st him helpless to thine aid  To shield the shepherd and protect the maid  Far off in thoughtless indolence resign'd  Soft dreams of love and pleasure soothe his mind  'Midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy  No wars alarm him and no fears annoy  AGIB  Yet these green hills in summer's sultry heat  Have lent the monarch oft a cool retreat  Sweet to the sight is Zabran's flowery plain  And once by maids and shepherds lov'd in vain  No more the virgins shall delight to rove  By Sargis' banks or Irwan's shady grove  On Tarkie's mountain catch the cooling gale  Or breathe the sweets of Aly's flowery vale  Fair scenes but ah no more with peace possest  With ease alluring and with plenty blest  No more the shepherds' whitening tents appear  Nor the kind produces of a bounteous year  No more the date with snowy blossoms crown'd  But Ruin spreads her baleful fires around  SECANDER  In vain Circassia boasts her spicy groves  For ever fam'd for pure and happy loves  In vain she boasts her fairest of the fair  Their eye's blue languish and their golden hair  Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief must send  Those hairs the Tartar's cruel hand shall rend  AGIB  Ye Georgian swains that piteous learn from far  Circassia's ruin and the waste of war  Some weightier arms than crooks and staffs prepare  To shield your harvests and defend your fair  The Turk and Tartar like designs pursue  Fix'd to destroy and stedfast to undo  Wild as his land in native deserts bred  By lust incited or by malice led  The villain Arab as he prowls for prey  Oft marks with blood and wasting flames the way  Yet none so cruel as the Tartar foe  To death inur'd and nurst in scenes of woe  He said when loud along the vale was heard  A shriller shriek and nearer fires appear'd  The frighted shepherds thro' the dews of night  Wide o'er the moonlight hills renew'd their flight  THE SPLENDID SHILLING BY MR J PHILIPS  This is reckoned the best parody of Milton in our language it has been an hundred times imitated without success The truth is the first thing in this way must preclude all future attempts for nothing is so easy as to burlesque any man's manner when we are once shewed the way  HAPPY the man who void of cares and strife  In silken or in leathern purse retains  A Splendid Shilling he nor hears with pain  New oysters cry'd nor sighs for chearful ale  But with his friends when nightly mists arise  To Juniper's Magpye or TownHall  Two noted alehouses in Oxford  repairs  Where mindful of the nymph whose wanton eye  Transfix'd his soul and kindled amorous flames  Cloe or Philips he each circling glass  Wisheth her health and joy and equal love  Mean while he smokes and laughs at merry tale  Or Pun ambiguous or Conundrum quaint  But I whom griping penury surrounds  And hunger sure attendant upon want  With scanty offals and small acid tiff  Wretched repast my meagre corps sustain  Then solitary walk or doze at home  In garret vile and with a warming puff  Regale chill'd fingers or from tube as black  As winter chimney or wellpolish'd jet  Exhale Mundungus illperfuming scent  Not blacker tube nor of a shorter size  Smokes CambroBriton vers'd in pedigree  Sprung from Cadwalador and Arthur kings  Full famous in romantic tale when he  O'er many a craggy hill and barren cliff  Upon a cargo of fam'd Cestrian cheese  High overshadowing rides with a design  To vend his wares or at th' Arvonian mart  Or Maridunum or the antient town  Yclip'd Brechinia or where Vaga's stream  Encircles Ariconium fruitful soil  Whence flow nectareous wines that well may vie  With Massic Setin or renown'd Falern  Thus while my joyless minutes tedious flow  With looks demure and silent pace a Dun  Horrible monster hated by gods and men  To my aërial citadel ascends  With vocal heel thrice thundering at my gate  With hideous accent thrice he calls I know  The voice illboding and the solemn sound  What should I do or whither turn amaz'd  Confounded to the dark recess I fly  Of woodhole strait my bristling hairs erect  Thro' sudden fear a chilly sweat bedews  My shudd'ring limbs and wonderful to tell  My tongue forgets her faculty of speech  So horrible he seems his faded brow  Entrench'd with many a frown and conic beard  And spreading band admir'd by modern saints  Disastrous acts forebode in his right hand  Long scrolls of paper solemnly he waves  With characters and figures dire inscrib'd  Grievous to mortal eyes ye gods avert  Such plagues from righteous men behind him stalks  Another monster not unlike himself  Sullen of aspect by the vulgar call'd  A Catchpole whose polluted hands the Gods  With force incredible and magic charms  First have endu'd if he his ample palm  Should haply on illfated shoulder lay  Of debtor strait his body to the touch  Obsequious as whilom knights were wont  To some inchanted castle is convey'd  Where gates impregnable and coercive chains  In durance strict detain him till in form  Of money Pallas sets the captive free  Beware ye debtors when ye walk beware  Be circumspect oft with insiduous ken  This caitiff eyes your steps aloof and oft  Lies perdue in a nook or gloomy cave  Prompt to inchant some inadvertent wretch  With his unhallow'd touch So poets sing  Grimalkin to domestic vermin sworn  An everlasting foe with watchful eye  Lies nightly brooding o'er a chinky gap  Protending her fell claws to thoughtless mice  Sure ruin So her disembowell'd web  Arachne in a hall or kitchen spreads  Obvious to vagrant flies she secret stands  Within her woven cell the humming prey  Regardless of their fate rush on the toils  Inextricable nor will aught avail  Their arts or arms or shapes of lovely hue  The wasp insiduous and the buzzing drone  And butterfly proud of expanded wings  Distinct with gold entangled in her snares  Useless resistance make with eager strides  She tow'ring flies to her expected spoils  Then with envenom'd jaws the vital blood  Drinks of reluctant foes and to her cave  Their bulky carcases triumphant drags  So pass my days But when nocturnal shades  This world invelop and th' inclement air  Persuades men to repel benumbing frosts  With pleasant wines and crackling blaze of wood  Me lonely sitting nor the glimmering light  Of makeweight candle nor the joyous talk  Of loving friend delights distress'd forlorn  Amidst the horrors of the tedious night  Darkling I sigh and feed with dismal thoughts  My anxious mind or sometimes mournful verse  Indite and sing of groves and myrtle shades  Or desp'rate lady near a purling stream  Or lover pendent on a willowtree  Mean while I labour with eternal drought  And restless wish and rave my parched throat  Finds no relief nor heavy eyes repose  But if a slumber haply does invade  My weary limbs my fancy's still awake  Thoughtful of drink and eager in a dream  Tipples imaginary pots of ale  In vain awake I find the settled thirst  Still gnawing and the pleasant fantom curse  Thus do I live from pleasure quite debarr'd  Nor taste the fruits that the sun's genial rays  Mature JohnApple nor the downy Peach  Nor Walnut in roughfurrow'd coat secure  Nor Medlar fruit delicious in decay  Afflictions great yet greater still remain  My Galligaskins that have long withstood  The winter's fury and encroaching frosts  By Time subdu'd what will not Time subdue  An horrid chasm disclos'd with orifice  Wide discontinuous at which the winds  Eurus and Auster and the dreadful force  Of Boreas that congeals the Cronean waves  Tumultuous enter with dire chilling blasts  Portending agues Thus a well fraught ship  Long sail'd secure or thro' th' Aegean deep  Or th' Ionean till cruising near  The Lilybean shore with hideous crush  On Scylla or Charybdis dang'rous rocks  She strikes rebounding whence the shatter'd oak  So fierce a shock unable to withstand  Admits the sea in at the gaping side  The crowding waves gush with impetuous rage  Resistless overwhelming horrors seize  The mariners death in their eyes appear  They stare they lave they pump they swear they pray  Vain efforts Still the batt'ring waves rush in  Implacable till delug'd by the foam  The ship sinks found'ring in the vast abyss  A PIPE OF TOBACCO IN IMITATION OF SIX SEVERAL AUTHORS  Mr Hawkins Browne the author of these as I am told had no good original manner of his own yet we see how well he succeeds when he turns an imitator for the following are rather imitations than ridiculous parodies  IMITATION I A NEWYEAR's ODE  RECITATIVE  OLD battlearray big with horror is fled

Wafting round a mild perfume  RECITATIVE  Let foreign climes the vine and orange boast  While wastes of war deform the teeming coast  Britannia distant from each hostile sound  Enjoys a Pipe with case and freedom crown'd  E'en restless Faction finds itself most free  Or if a slave a slave to Liberty  AIR  Smiling years that gayly run  Round the zodiac with the sun  Tell if ever you have seen  Realms so quiet and serene  British sons no longer now  Hurl the bar or twang the bow  Nor of crimson combat think  But securely smoke and drink  CHORUS  Smiling years that gayly run  Round the zodiac
