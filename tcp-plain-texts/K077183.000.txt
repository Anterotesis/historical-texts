Labour wears a chearful face  Sure I taste of joys sincere  My true swain for ever near  When with ceaseless toils oppress'd  Wearied nature sinks to rest  All my labours to beguile  Love shall wake

bundles of flax are lying  DUETTO  Phil  Thus of thy tender love possess'd  My heart is glad my spirits blest  Thy chearful looks thy soul sincere  Shall give the smile and wipe the tear  Col  No splendor guilds my homely scene  My stores are few my cottage mean  But if thy smile rewards my pain  I'll think myself a wealthy swain  BOTH  No jealous thought shall stain my breast  No fears alarm no cares molest  Pleas'd with the Swain Nymph my hopes pursue  For He She is kind and I am true  SCENE II  Hobbinol  and  Damon  Hob  Go your ways for a pair of fond pidgeons Ah Damon it was just so for all the world when I went a courting to our Cicely there was such piping singing and dancingah these were merry dayswell wellbut they are all done and past  Dam  True neighbour true we have had our day let the young ones begin nowthe very thoughts or their approaching happiness makes my old nerves spring and I could almost caper for joy hody o'me I grow young again at the sight of them  AIR  Tho' my features I'm told  Are grown wrinkled and old  Dull wisdom I hate and detest  Not a wrinkle is there  Which is furrow'd by care  And my heart is as light as the best  When I look on my boys  They renew all my joys  Myself in my children I see  While the comforts I find  In the kingdom my mind  Pronounce that my kingdom is free  In the days I was young  Oh I caper'd and sung  The lasses came flocking apace  But now turn'd of threescore  I can do so no more  Why then let my boy take my place  Of our pleasures we crack  For we still love the smack  And chuckle o'er what we have been  Yet why should we repine  You've had yours I've had mine  And now let our children begin  Hob  What signify the great folk with their lace and their furbelowall is not gold that glistens  Dam  Ay ay neighbour many a sound looking sheep is rotten at heartour pleasures may be as good though not so costly as theirs  Hob  'Twas but last summer Damon that our squire got himself a wife a parless fine lady and a rich one too yet a body would believe that they came together only to live asunderfor madam lies in one bed squire lies in another and they are now like the two buckets of our town wellwhen one comes up to'ther goes down and if they happen to meet each other you would think they had never seen one another before adod they live likewhat do you call it therethe fine toy that your pedlers sell about the countrya weather house I think they call it when the woman  steps cut the man pops in If this be the matrimony of your town folks give me the country I say  Dam  I'll warrant it will not be so with our young couple blessing light upon them they think of nothing but the feast and the dance and adod we'll dance at the wedding too  Hob  Ah ahdon't you remember come Lammas 'twill be six and forty years agone when I met Cicely at our feast  AIR  When the head of poor Tummas was broke  By Roger who play'd at the wake  And Kate was alarm'd at the stroke  And wept for poor Tumma's sake  When his worship gave noggins of ale  And the liquor was charming and stout  O these were the times to regale  And we footed it rarely about  Then our partners were buxom as does  And we all were as happy as kings  Each lad in his holyday cloaths  And the lasses in all their best things  What merriment all the day long  May the feast of our children prove such  O  sooks but I'll join in the song  And I'll hobble about with my crutch  Dam  Ay it was that very day his worship was made justice of the peace and coram  Hob  Yes Damon I remember then Cicely and you came together for the first time She was a rich wench then her cheeks were as fresh as a rose and as red as a camarine pear There was your dancing Damon when she and I were partners and  HUNTING PIECE  Col  Oh neighbours neighbours all our ground is overrun with horses hounds and huntsmenthey drive through the corn Plague on all sportsmen they are born to ruin us Here Roger Tummas quick make haste the gate stands open shut it fast for if we don't take care they'll ravage all  Phil  We must be patient Colin its the Duke's hunt  Col  A murrain take all hunts I sayhere are they hunting about every day and all day and their fine sports forsooth must be our ruin our labour is all in vainThey are coming this way I think get in lads and lasses these roaring fellows are keen sportsmen when they have our wives and daughters in chase  Exeunt all but  Colin  How I am terrifiedwhat if they should rob me of my Phillis'should the very thought on't sets me mad with rage  AIR  Now Fury vengeance fire my mind  My breast I like a chaldron find  Thro' every vein now toiling  Hark how my blood is boiling  Roaring rumbling  Bubling tumbling  In the conflict tost  My reason's lost  Sure no power on earth can ever  From this heart my fair dissever  SCENE III  Enter  Duke  and  Frederick  Fred  A country girl good Sir and is this the object of your adoration  Duke  It is and what is still more extraordinary her wit charms me as much as her beauty  Fred  A miracle  Duke  She is inded a wonder and I have been told that an old lady whose circumstances obliged her to dwell in retirement has been the protectress of this sweet creature and formed and cultivated her mind by an excellent education leaving her possessed of the most amiable simplicity a native frankness of temper and an agreeable vivacity  Fred  Does not your highness fear some imputation  Duke  What signifies the blood she springs from A handsome woman is naturally born above her condition  Fred  But the princess Emily Sir her rank and fortune  Duke  I confess them yet my heart 'spite of myself is on the point of proving faithless to her I doat on this little rural innocent and what is still more extraordinary with but little hopes of success  Fred  Is she so coy then What can she resist one of the first dukes in all Saxony  AIR  When first a princely lover tries  To pierce the artless female heart  With panting fear oppress'd  Each rising wish suppress'd  The tim'rous nymph repels the dart  In vain the soft deceiver sighs  Till vanity soon lending aid  The fond deluded fair's betray'd  Duke  How romantic must I appear to you when I own that I adore her and yet which is perhaps the best proof I have never dared to utter my passion  Fred  But how can you hope to gain her heart without solicitation  Duke  For that purpose I have at length retained a female solicitor Mademoiselle whom I have sent to exert all her artifice to win her to the court I have no reliance but upon her skill but here they comeLet us retire and watch their conversation  SCENE IV  Mademoiselle  and  Phillis  Mad  Ah ma chere how you be so merry so gay dans un etat si pauvre you no live in de vorld  Phil  The obscurity of my

Ah Morbleu your beauté command de l'amour de love comme you will briller at de court  Phil  Ah madam I see you laugh at me I am not designed for such fine folks I should be ashamed to shew my face at

then ah madame your toilette  Phil  Toilette what's that  Mad  De treasure of de fine ladies der they embellish their charms nature'lle  AIR  Yes that's a magazine of arms  To triumph over time  Whence beauty borrows half her charms  And always keeps her prime  At that the prude coquette and saint  Industrious sets her face  While powder patch and wash and paint  Repair or give a grace  To arch the brow there lies the brush  The comb to tinge the hair  The spanish wool to give the blush  The pearl to die them fair  Hence rise the wrinkled old and grey  In freshest beauty strong  As Venus fair as Flora gay  As Hebe ever young  Phil  This is past my comprehension I don't understand itShall I grow handsomer at court  Mad  Aye to be sure  Phil  I should like it vastly I wish I was

all your care    to Duke  Such kindness is the devil  Duke  I was in hopes my tenderness might have won upon you the happy Colin I perceive interests you more may he be the means of compleating your happiness tho' I am rewarded with afflictions But your will shall be my law Adieu remember think upon my love and be assured of every service in my power  Exit  SCENE VII  Col  Thank heaven the coast

not they say it is a charming place we'll go together love  Col  Hear me Phillis nothing that's handsome is safe at court his design is to betray you which you don't seem to suspect He talked to you about love why did you listen to him Phillis  Phil  What if he did talk about love his love is hopeless and your courtiers are too well bred to offend against good manners  Col  Yes yes they are such sort of folks to be sure you have found them so  Phil  Why do you suspect me I only give ear to such discourse to laugh at it to laugh with you my dear Colin remain secure in that assurance  Col  O no doubt that is charming and fine but don't I see him at this very moment lurking about and staring upon you as if he'd look you through and through and he is not yet gone about his business go home to

I'll tell him all I swear  O lud you break my arm  SCENE VIII  Enter  Duke  and  Frederick  Duke  Insolent villain release her this instant  Col  Let us alone sir I beseech you 'tis our own affair and you have nothing to do with us  Fred  Stand off fellow it is the Duke  Phil  The Duke you the Duke  Duke  Yes I endeavoured to conceal my rank that your love might be disinterested but to preserve you I will now use my own authoritycome hither  Col  The Dukethe Devil  Aside  Duke  Come Phillis and adorn my court there your beauty shall shine with all its advantages and partake with the sovereign the homage of all hearts  Phil  Yes sir I will go with you  Duke  Then Frederick to you I commit the charge of conducting my fair one to court  Exit  Phil  to Colin  Henceforth you shall learn to

 For pity begone  O fortune accurst  All  With vexation I rage I shall burst  ACT II  SCENE I A Toilet Phillis dressing  Madamoiselle  and  Clara  AIR  Phil  THANK you ladies for your care  But I pray you both forbear  Sure I am all o'er scratches  That your curious hands must place  Such odd spots upon my face  With your pencils paint and patches  How I totter in my gait  From a dress of so much weight  With my robe too dangling after  Could my Colin now but see  What a thing they've made of me  Oh he'd split his sides with laughter  You have made a strange figure of me indeed at last these things are wonderous aukward to me pray let's have done  Mad  A leetel more rogue for votre ladyship silvous plait  Phil  Ladyship don't laugh at me  Mad  Von lettel bit more  Phil  More daubing have done I"ll no more on't  Cla  Your diamonds madam  Phil  O how they sparklebut there are some flowerspho they have no smellevery thing is unnatural here beauty is but a painted sign all is impostor even to the very flowers  Cla  These flowers ma'am are made to please the sight not the smell and in this instance they excell those of nature  Mad  Quelle amiable figure  Cla  How immensely eleganthorrid creature  Aside  Phil  overhearing  What did you say  Cla  You'll be the object of general adoration all the world will feel the force of your charms  Phil  Charms are these your charms I hardly know myself and yet after all a peacock a jay or a butterfly is drest ten times finer Here are gold and silver and jewels and ribbands of all the colours in the rainbowa great hoop that hides my real figure washes that take away my natural complexion shoes that will cripple me and stays that make me crooked I wish I was in my own cloaths again  AIR  When late a simple rustic lass  I rov'd without constraint  A stream was all my lockingglass  And health my only paint  The charms I boast alas how few  I gave to not nature's care  As vice ne'er spoil'd their native hue  They could not want repair  Mad  Pardonne moi votre ladyship sing mighty vell pon my vord but you want de bon ton  Cla  Aye there it is your ladyship has no Italian expression which is the life and soul of all musick the very essence of harmony Your singers of taste will run up and down the ladder of sounds from the cellar up to the garret now rumbling along till they make your ears crack again and then in the piano they expire like a swan to their own melody In our favourite composition we are not contented with making the sound an echo to the sense but by a happy tumbling of both together create the most agreeable confusion of harmony in the universe  Phil  It may be very fine but I don't like it this taste as you call it seems to have declared war against nature and turned all her works topsyturvy pray shall I meet with all these fopperies at court  Cla  Court madam abounds with curiosities there you will meet a thousand objects to entertain you there are your pretty little creatures with high heels to their shoes and solitaires round their necks that look so ladylike you would think they were women with swords by their sides then there are your precise puppets trotting along with formal bands under their chins and plastered wigs upon their head whispering strange nothings in your ear and exhibiting at one view the most whimsical combination of pride and servility  AIR  Phil  How strange the mode which truth neglects  And rests all beauty in defects  But we by homely nature taught  Tho' rude in speech are plain in thought  Phil  Come then I long to be there let us to court  Mad  I'ave de honour to present milady vid her fan  Phil  Dear me what use can I make of this  Cia  This is a wonderful instrument its exercise is various and elegant  Mad  I vill tell you I vil shew you de use madame  AIR  For various purpose serves the fan  As thusa decent blind  Between the sticks to peep at man  Nor yet betray your mind  Each action has a meaning plain  Resentment's in the snap  A flirt expresses strong disdain  Consent a gentle tap  All passions will the fan disclose  All modes of female art  And to advantage sweetly shews  The hand if not the heart  'Tis folly's sceptre first design'd  By love's capricious boy  Who knows how lightly all mankind  Are govern'd by a toy  SCENE II  Enter  Duke  and  Frederick  Duke  Yes Frederick I do observe nay pity her though from her delicacy she has not hitherto upbraided me I perceive the princess entertains strong suspicions which you know are but too well grounded  Fred  Yet those my lord are easily removed  Duke  And how  Fred  Your highnesse's orders have already done it for what you promised Phillis will be a proof by which Emily cannot suspect that this amour has any thing real in it When this same Colin whom the young madam doats on comes to court his love will be a blind for your's  Duke  True I have sent for him but what then pray explain  Fred  The aukward simplicity of country lovers must make an agreeable contrast with the elegance of court manners an amusement only fit for laughter as such only you designed it for that purpose you brought them hither for entertainment and observation the princess cannot suspect your designs upon Phillis when her own Collin is permitted to be with her and you will easily find means to compass your intentions when all suspicions are quieted  AIR  The harsh resolve O yet withhold  Forbear her gentle heart to grieve  If only painful truth is told  'Tis mercy to deceive  Our wishes aid each slight disguise  And love the place of truth supplies  Duke  But see the princess comesI would avoid her  Exeunt  SCENE III  Enter  Emily  and  Clara  Emi  He shuns me Clara alas 'tis now beyond all doubt  Cla  Do not torment yourself and create imaginary affliction  AIR  Ourselves too often we deceive  And wrong our judgment to believe  When thinking harshly of the swain  We cheat our hopes and brood on pain  Emi  With the generality of women I confess the heart is not so much affected as their vanity is hurt by the fickleness of their lovers Selflove is too often the link which unites their souls but the only interest which sways my bosom is the purest and tendered affection  Cla  Believe me madam the Duke is no stranger to your tendernesshe will return it  Emi  You would comfort me I seeperhaps I am alarm'd from too slight a cause however watch their steps if you regard your mistress  AIR  If tyrant love with cruel dart  Transfix the maidens tender heart  Of easy faith and fond belief  She hugs the dart and aids the thief  Till left her helpless state to mourn  Neglected loving and forlorn  She finds while grief her bosom stings  As well as darts the god has wings  But who is this the Duke brings with himoh 'tis the village nymph he so much doats on I must observe them  Exit  SCENE IV  Enter  Phillis  and  Duke  Duke  Well what think you of the court does it delight you Phillis  Phil  It is the seat of wonders every thing changes character here the men are quite different I met one who is the lord of the manor in our neighbourhood a very proud gentleman amongst us he carries his head so high and so fierce and threatens folks with his cane in the country if they do but look upon him here he was bowing and scraping and cringing like a spaniel Why are they so complaisant here these great folks who terrify and domineer over us in the country Does the court make them so much better No I believe if they do any good here 'tis only to get a right to do something bad elsewhere  Duke  I hear you with pleasure did not the brilliancy and politeness of the court surprize you  Phil  Oh they were extravagantly polite indeed they paid their compliments with wonderful civility and ran over my person and features in a loud whisper with the most minute observationupon my word she's a mighty pretty right thing quite an angel for the country what a poor little innocent it is what an air she has what a walk what a voice  Duke▪  Oh that is meer pleasantrythey'll be more careful by and by and shew you infinitely more respect they will be eager  o invent new diversions for you the will read your wishes in your eyes and I my dear will serve them as a model  SCENE V  Enter  Emily  and  Clara  Emi to Phil  So madam you have made a noble conquest Suffer me I beseech you to pay my homage where the Duke pays his  Duke  Nay but Emily you misunderstand  Emi  Your superior charms  to Phil  Phil  Pray madam do not mock me  Emi  Don't disturb yourself my lord my presence interrupts I see I will retire  to the Duke  Phil  Stay stay we have no secret to talk of The Duke and I  Emi  I understand you madam it were wonderful indeed if charms like yours had not most terrible effects  AIR  I must approve your highness flame  Your passion for the fair  And all the world must feel the same  Who marks her shape and air  A mein so rich in ev'ry grace  Her manners so polite  Such beauty beaming from her face  Was ever such a fright  Phil  So then the Duke is her lover yes yes I plainly perceive it Upon my word this place abounds with very odd customs    to the  Duke  can you divide your heart to two at a time    to  Emily  the Duke loves me too madam he has sworn it  Emi  ironically to the  Duke    Meer pleasantry that's all  Duke  Nay but I assure you  to Emi  Phil  You need not be under any apprehensions on my account for my part I love Colin  to Emi  Duke  Yes yes Colin is her love and Colin shall come I told you so    to  Emily  don't give any credit  Emi  I believe nothing  Duke  'Twas but a whim that caused all this for I imagined the rustic simplicity of these peasants might  make an agreeable contrast with the refined manners of our courtiers  Emi  forcing a laugh  A very ridiculous project truly Oh we shall be charmingly amused come let us hear some of her prattleWell my dear and how do you like the court  Phil  May I speak my lord  Duke  Oh what you please  Phil  Then if I must fairly confess the truth I am heartily tired of this horrid place where every object I perceive seems a contradiction to common sense their whole design is to reverse nature where people are for ever busy in doing nothing where they eat without appetite and lie down without rest where their mirth is all grimace and their pleasure nothing but perpetual noise  Cla  Her observation madam to me seems perfectly just groves and retirements are your only places for innocence and simplicity  AIR  Along your verdant lowly vale  Calm Zepbyr breathes a gentle gale  But rustling thro' the lofty trees  It swells beyond the peaceful breeze  Thus free from envy's poison'd dart  You beast a pure unruffled heart  While jarring thoughts our peace desorm  And swell our passions to a storm  Emi  And pray when is she to return to her village again is she to go tomorrow  Phil  No sir to night to night I beseech you the sooner the better  Emi  Come come then let us leave her to prepare for her journey and indulge her meditation on her beloved Colin your servant my dear  Duke  Adieu Phillis don't be uneasy your Colin will soon be here  Exeunt Duke and Emily  Phil  Your servant my dear a mighty pretty subject to laugh at truly e'en keep your Duke to yourself I want none of him I am sure I did not come here to look for him  weeping  I have nothing to reproach myself with only let them suffer me to go and I shall  be happy Is it my fault what have I to do with it If Colin was to treat me so instead of making myself so pleasant with other folks I should die for grief  Exit  Enter  Mademoiselle  Mad  Votre servante I have de message from the Duke pour vous maame  Cla  Message to me What does his highness command  Mad  You know Colin he be arrive at de court le prince bid you and I to try vid our charms to engager his heart to make an impression  Col  I understand it to detach him from Phillis and breed a quarrel between them well for my part I shall enter into the scheme very sincerely I know Colin he is a smart lad and I can never see any objection to a little amusement with a handsome young fellow but sure I see him yonder coming this waylet us first stand aside and observe him  SCENE VI  AIR  Col  Plague take such folks  Their whims their jokes  With their nonsense rant and riot  This calls me clown  That shoves me down  Can a body ne'er be quiet  So push'd about  Thrust in thrust out  In a tumult noise and hurry  I'm squeez'd to death  I've lost my breath  And my wits run hurry scurry  Here have they dragged me out of the country to make a fool and laughing stock of me a parcel of servants I think they called them though I took them for lords they were all so belaced and beruffled have put me into this dress farsooth in spite of my teeth and  what have I to do with these tawdry trappings I want nothing in this world but mine own sweetheart Phillis they came truly to fetch me hither and yet I can't find her a plague upon 'em every thing distracts me I know not whether I stand on my head or my legs  Cla  I'll e'en go and accost himsir sir  Col  Lud lud what can this fine lady want with me how she surveys me I believe she'll look me through and through  Cla  Pray sir what occasion can have brought you to court  Col  Me I only come to look for our Phillis  Cla  Who sir Phillis  Col  Yes a tight lass of our parish who has promised to be my wife but she has left me in the lurch  Cla  You amaze me That is scarce possible  Col  Aye forsooth but it's true  Cla  But after all sir why should that give you any manner of uneasiness a person of your figure I am sure has it always in his power to make a better choice you were never made to be treated with disdain I tell you so sir as a friend  Col  A friend to me madam Lord I never saw you before in my life  Cla  Upon my word sir I wish you well  Mad  E moi ausfi ah Monsieur you be charmant my heart vill not refuse to love you  Col  You too madam and without knowing me Oh this is the fine French lady

 Chorus  From tyrant love proceeds our care  Love's cruel empire who can bear  Begone then love fly far away  No more thy dictates we obey  A poor reward thy votaries gain  A moment's bliss and age of pain  ACT III  SCENE I A Street  Hobbinol  and  Damond  Dam  AYE aye neighbour your fine folk for all their vapouring and bouncing are no honester than they should be Who would have thought that our Phillis would have been sent for to court  Hob  Sent for quoth a no Damon trapanned drawn in by artificeLord what a parcel of nonsense of teeth and lips and ivory and coals and diamonds did some of these puppets pour out before the wenches in our village till the maids grew so fantastic that they did not know their heads from their tails  Dam  Fair words cover foul dealings give me plain speech▪ and plain manners I say  Hob  By my troth Gaffer I never could abide these leg making gentry who bow and scrape and palaver with their hats stuck like gizzards under their arms and all the while they mean no more by their civility than to cukold the husband or debauch the daughter  Dam  Thank heaven Hobbinol we have none of those vices we are not so polite and in good truth I envy none of those sort of folk  AIR  Tho my dress as my manners is simple and plain  A rascal I hate and a knave I disdain  My dealings are just and my conscience is clear  And I'm richer than those that have thousands a year  Tho' bent down with age and for sporting uncouth  I feel no remorse from the follies of youth  I still tell my tale and rejoice in my song  And my boys think my life not a moment too long  Let the courtiers th  se dealers in grin and grimace  Creep under dance over for title or place  Above all the titles that flow from a throne  That of honest I prize and that title's my own  Hob  But sure they cannot mean mischief to our young couple since my boy Colin has been sent for to court with all haste and to meet your Phillis they said Body o'me how their eyes will sparkle when they meet each other I'll warrant you now she is as melancholy as a turtle that has lost its mate  Dam  But for my part Hobbinol I cannot abide the thoughts of her being at court why the place is for all the world like a fair full of nonsense noise and shew  Hob  Aye neigbour they keep fair here all the year round and a plentiful market too only the goods now and then are a little stale  Dam  A plague take their town manners I say though I doff my hat never so low and bespeak them never so civilly they do but laugh in my face adod I think we have been as proper folks as the best of them in our time They mun keep their flaunts and fleers to themselves It is a wonderment to me neighbour how we found our way hither  Hob  Or how we escaped whole from so many dangers I thought I should have had my body squeezed to death by one of those fidgetting fellows with poles in his hands and a chair at his backside who thrust me into the kennel almost under the wheel of a coach and then surlily cried out"by your leave"Had I known that had been the way of asking civil question ecod but I would have had my crutch ready to have given him an answer  Dam  Well well these disasters are at an end now  Hob  True Gaffer true we mun not bide here we must try what we can to recover our children and for my part I do think Colin will be perfect mad if he misses his dear Phillis  Exeunt  SCENE II An Antichamber in the Palace  Enter  Frederick Phillis  and  Madamoiselle  Fred  I am sorry Colin's inconstancy should give you so much distress accidents of that sort are so common here nobody regards them a little farther acquaintance with court will convince you the failing is too general to deserve much blame  AIR  From flower to flower the Butterfly  O'er fields or gardens ranging  Sips sweets from each and flutters by  And all his life is changing  Thus roving man new objects sway  By various charms delighted  Whilst she who pleases most today  Tomorrow shall be flighted  Phi  Faithless faithless Colin and pray Madamoiselle does Colin know the duke designs to visit me  Mad  Oui oui he be informed long since poor soul  Phi  The news of it has affected him no doubt  Mad  Certainement madame pour a little quarter of an hour or so  Fred  I beheld him run up and down stamping and tearing and raving and rending like a madman then he'd stop short of a sudden and folding his arms like a lover despairing beside a clear stream heave a desperate sigh with the most rueful length of face mortal ever beheld  Mad  Vraiment it was pitoyable case  AIR  Oh 'twould pierce a heart of stone  To hear him roar and blubber  So great a lover ne'er was known  Nor e'er so great a lubber  Like little master left alone  By gay mamma forsaken  With hiecup sob and sigh and groan  His heart is almost breaking  Fred  But like the rest of his sex sorrow took no fast hold of him 'twas but an April shower and all was fair again  Phil  Indeed were it not for his treachery I could almost find in my heart to pity himBut I find myself strangely fatigued your pleasures here pall the mind without entertaining it my spirits are quite overpowered  Fred  I am glad of it now now you begin to have the bon tonI was sure your ladyship could not be so long amongst the polite world without catching the manners of it 'Tis nothing but nerves and fashionable vapours A thing of course  Phil  Vapours and weak nerves why can it be a fashion to be sick  Fred  O lord its downright ungenteel to be otherwise your ruddy complexion and active limbs may do very well for a dairy maid in the country but here they are perfectly unnecessary nay absolutely improper Lord ma'm it is as unfashionable for a fine lady to be without a complaint as to be out of debt  Phil  The more I observe your manners here the more they surprise meBut there is a scheme come into my head were it not possible Mademoiselle that Colin might be conceal'd somewhere hereabouts that he may overhear our intercourse  Mad  Sans doubte madame but pourquoi for what purpose  Phil  The dearest in the world revenge  Mad  Ah dat be the most delicious morsel  Fred  And the injustice he has done you by his suspicions deserves the worst of mortifications from your hands  Phil  Well then sir to you and Mademoiselle I leave the management of this affair The Duke will be delighted with it Adieu I shall attend his highness's pleasure  Exeunt Fred and Mad  If Colin blames me now 'tis not without reason but I will still surprise him more he shall be satisfied as to the interview between the Duke and me and if my contrivance succeeds the princess too shall be served Alas why came I hither Is it the air I breathe which poisons all my peace At home my only thought was mirth there all was tranquillity pleasure and happiness▪  AIR  When far from fashion's gilded scence  I breath'd my native air  My thoughts were calm my mind serene  No doubtings harbour'd there  But now no more myself I find  Distraction rends my breast  Whilst hopes and fears disturb my mind  And banish all my rest  SCENE III  Enter  Emily  and  Clara  Emi  So Clara I still find her here you see The so much boasted charms of the country will I fear lose all their relish after the splendour of a court  Cla  Love madam is undoubtedly very intoxicating and it is no wonder if the addresses of a duke turn the brain of an ignorant village lass  AIR  Flatt'ring hopes the mind deceiving  Easy faith too often cheat  Woman fond and all believing  Loves and hugs the dear deceit  Noisy shews of pomp and riches  Cupid's tricks to catch the fair  Lowly maids too oft bewitches  Flatt'ry is the beauty's snare  Emi  So then you will not leave us yet The court has stronger attractions than you were aware of Phillis  Phi  Alas madam did it depend upon my choice I would be far off The pleasures of this place are lost upon me they are too artificial for us simple folks who are the servants of nature  Emi  Quit then as fast as you can a place so contrary to your matters I would not delay a moment Alas why cannot I shake off this troublesome pomp and pageantry of courts  AIR  Return sweet lass to flocks and swains  Where simple nature mildly reigns  Where love is every shepherd's care  And every nymph is kind as fair  The court has only tinsel toys  Insipid mirth and idle noise  But rural joys are ever new  While nymphs are kind and shepherds true  Phil  Upon my word ladies you reason excellently well in your turn I perceive the advice of every body flows from selfinterested motives You would most obligingly inform me that my presence displeases you madam I heartily believe itBut now I think on it I can't go yet 'tis absolutely impossible I have a particular engagemement with the Duke  Emi  With the Duke  Phil  Yes with the Duke oh you will laugh exceedingly  Emi  Laugh I laugh how  Phil  The Duke you know is in love with you  Emi  sighs  And what then  Phil  Then why he desires an interview with me  Emi  Which you have granted I suppose  Phil  Oh doubtless It is not for folks in such an humble situation as mine to refuse so great an honour and indeed after so many instances of friendship and protection it were a sin to deny so small a request But I see Madam you are discompos'd  Emi  Who I not I not in the least  Phil  I can't abide to be thought ungrateful  Emi  So then Phillis after all this parade of honour and virtue and love you can make an assignation  Phil  Come come don't be suspicious where you dread a rival you may find a friend I pity your uneasiness madam nor will I ever be the cause of adding to it Come then with me and if possible endeavour to forget your jealous resentment I warrant you all will be well yet  SCENE IV An apartment with a couch and table  Colin  solus  Col  I am ruined undone They have bewitch'd her they have given her something to steal away her heart and yet I can scarce believe itIt is impossibleWhat Phillis meet the Duke alone alas it is but too truehere behold me in the very chambercan I yet doubt Ah that couch that telltale couch suggests enough to make me shudderwhat an object for a faithful sweet heart such  as I am What alarms what violent emotions it raises My folly has aggravated her to an entire neglect of meWell heaven be thank'd I am not quite friendless yetThe good natur'd gentlewoman who was so civil to me before has sent me hither whether I may overhear alllet me see I'll conceal myself under this table and from thence observe what passes and if I find my suspicions true I know how to be reveng'd for the trick she has play'd me Yes thou cruel hardhearted Phillis I'll suddenly break out and shame youin midst of your joys I'll tell you to your face that you are a false ungrateful hussey and thenI'll go hang myself and then you shall never see me more  AIR  My tender heart now bleeds in vain  My tears she sees with cold disdain  Ah spare me cruel fair  Give one kind look I ask no more  My lost repose again restore  Nor leave me to despair  After the song Colin hides himself under the table  SCENE V  Enter  Duke  and  Phillis  Phil  Well my lord you find me your obedient servant down to the ground what would your highness have with me  Duke  Can that be a question nowah Phillis does not the tenor of my whole behaviour explain itself to you Come come you know I love you  Colin peeping from under the table speaks in a low voice  Col  I can scarce contain  Phil  Alas my lord I was born to humbler hopes and your highness can never be at a loss for a more worthy subject  Duke  More worthysurely Phillis you take a pleasure in creating my misery  Phi  No I would rather wish to make you happy  Col  Very well  Duke  Alas I have wish'd I have sigh'd a long time for a heart without guile a heart that was simple and ingenious a happiness not to be met with at court  Phi  Oh my lord that happiness you have always in your own power  Col  Oh he'll take the hint I'll warrant  Duke  My power do you approve my passion then am I so blest  Phi  Indeed I will not hesitate one moment to make you so  Col  Oh she will not hesitate  Duke  Why then my charmer should we linger My spirits are all in arms and my heart flutters with expectation  Col  So things are in a very ticklish way I perceive  Phi  Pray my lordmake allowances for a young country maid I am so asham'd so confounded at seeing myself alone with you I can never stand ityou must permit me to snuff the candles out  The stage darken'd  Col  Oh very modest indeed  Duke  aside  So so my country girl is not altogether unexperiencedWell my lovewhither are you going  Phi  Only to be satisfied that the doors are fasten'd I so dread the princess she is continually on the watch  she steals out and pushes the princess in  Emi  aside  How my heart beatsI shall never have courage to approach him  Duke  Come my charmer share the transports of my passion  Col  HarkWhat are they aboutI am terrifiedall silencenay then my rival triumphs  The princess breaks from the duke  Emi  Pray my lord  aside  what a situation am I brought into  The duke catches her again  Emi  Oh  Col  A sigh monstrous I can hold no longer  He comes from under the table  Col  Torture fury rage despair  This much injur'd bosom tear  Go perjur'd treach'rous maid  Why am I thus betray'd  Duke  PreventedO confusion  Such insolent intrusion  Swift vengeance shall attend  Emi  Was ever such disgrace  In pity to my case  Ye powers assistance lend  Duke  Wretch begone from anger fly  Col  Your threats I scorn your rage defy  Phi  Good folkbe calm I pray  Phillis enters with lights followed by Clara and Mademoiselle they all stare at seeing each other  Why all this mighty fray  Must you look big and bluff sir  To  Col  Col  Forbear my dear that fault to blame  Which rose from love to you  Duke  Amaz'd expos'd I blush for shame  What shall I say what shall I do  Mad Cla  This is pastime more rare  It delights me I swear  Emi  Hopes and fears my soul involve  Duke  Which way turn on what resolve  Mad  Well here's some plot  Cla  Sure some mistake  Duke  I hardly breathe  Emi  I scarce can speak  Mad  How will this end  Cla  What can it mean  Col  Here's something strange  Phi  I can't explain  ALL  Oh hows tormenting how severe  The plagues that love is doom'd to bear  Phi  to Duke  Now Sir you are master of that treasure you so long desired be happy in the possession of itAnd now Colin what is become of your jealousy Take care how you harbour again a fiend which destroys all peace  Col  I begin to revive again  Emi  Assured as I am of your inconstancy I might perhaps break out into reproaches but your conduct afflicts me more than it offends and makes me happy without being violent I see Sir I have lost your heart  going  Duke  stopping her  Stay stay my princess our hearts were not design'd for such separation Phillis it is true by thus enlightening my bewildered senses has  humbled me sufficiently and I should blush indeed if I did not endeavour to imitate her her example shall excite me and if my revived affections are worthy of a return Hymen shall unite us on this day  Emi  Love surely may excuse its own frailtiesoh Phillis let me embrace thee how much do I owe to your friendshiphow shall I reward you  Phil  Leave that to Colin madam for from him alone I expect it Come  Colin  endeavour to mend your errors here take my hand now you know all my vengeance  AIR  Again in rustic weeds array'd  A simple swain a simple maid  O'er rural scenes with joy we'll rove  By dimpling brook or cooling grove  The birds shall strain their little throats  And warble wide their merry notes  Whilst we converse beneath the shade  A happy Swain and happy maid  Col  Nor shall thou be deceivedlet us away with haste We will be married straight this is true joy indeed what need of so much mystery to be happy but however Sir I pray you leave off your hunting on our grounds Peace and quietness are better than all the honours in the world  Duke  May heaven protect you both live long in peace and happiness and share my bounties as you please  Enter  Frederick  Fred  Here are two old men come after Colin and Phillis they make such a bustle and clamour one would think they were stark staring mad  Duke  Oh Bring them in The happiness will now be general indeed    To  Emily  what uneasiness has my folly produced But  Dam  without  I tell you I will have my daughter  Hob  without  Give me my son I say body o' me you smock fac'd chitterling Oh that I was but three score for your sake  Dam  Don't talk to me my own's my own and I will come in  Phil  Good heaven my father  Enter  Hobbinol  and  Damon  Dam  So so we have found you nowAdod but we have not They do nothing but make fools of us I think  Hob  For my part I believe it is the land of lies I did not want such fine folks our search is after a couple of stray'd children and they told us they were here  going up to Colin  I pray you sir can you tell me any tidings  discovering him  Ods my life its my own boy Colin I am transported I am overjoyedand why did not you answer your father you dogonly see Damon how they have bedizen'd him alooks for all the world like the king in the puppetshew  Phi  to Dam  And here too is your Phillis sir it is no wonder you should not discover me through this disguise  Dam  Have I recovered thee at last my child my neighbour and I have had a wearisome pursuit after thee  Col  All is well that ends well father we shall now be as happy as the day is long thanks to the duke there in truth we are much obliged to him  Hob  Oblig'd quotha yes yes I suppose you are oblig'd  AIR  No doubt but your fool'scap has known  His highness obligingly kind    Odzooks I could knock the fool down  Was e'er such a cuckoldy hind  To be sure like a goodnatur'd spouse  You've lent him a part of your bed  He has fitted the horns to your brows  And I see them sprout out of your head  To keep your wife virtuous and chaste  The court is a wonderful school  My lord you've an excellent taste  And son you're a cuckoldy fool  If your lady should bring you an heir  The blood will flow rich in his veins  Many thanks to my lord for his care  You dog I could knock out your brains  Col  I scorn to be any man's slave  I know what is proper and right  Hob  You talk sir exceedingly brave  You puppy get out of my sight  Col  Dear father ne'er trust to report  My Phillis is true to her swain  Hob  Then why this fine jaunt up to court  You dupe you're a cuckold in grain  Duke  Be not so distrustful old friend I have seen my error and repent it The temporary uneasiness you have found in the loss of your children will be amply compensated in the happiness of to day Here  taking Emily by the hand  my affections are settled Phillis merits no suspicions and if mutual love happily rewarded can ensure a blessing upon earth her union to day with Colin shall effect it Come come we shall all be happy  Emi  You may be perfectly satisfied sir your fears are all groundless It is from the conviction of her innocence and by her interposition that all parties are reconciled Surely you ought to be satisfied on this point when you see I am  to Hob  Hob  Say you so why then come hither children heaven bless youbody o'me but I cry for joy  Dam  Let me join my blessing too And now adod I'm as gay as a lark and as light as a cork  Duke  From this hour my bliss commences How sweet it is to gain the affection of a heart which owes all its charms to innocence and simplicity but to find one without guile in the midst of courts whose honesty of nature is not corrupted though it is cultivated by art makes up my peculiar felicity  CHORUS  Let care no more my peace annoy  Nor jealous fears our bliss destroy  While constancy and love sincere  Rewards each blest each happy pair  Col  For thee ay love shall ever burn  Thou art my fondest aim  Phil  May love shall yield thee sweet return  I burn with equal flame  Emi  No care shall e'er my soul annoy  No fears my bliss destroy  Col  For thee my love shall burn  Phil  My love shall yield return  Emi  My love shall yield return  All  Oh this is perfect joy  FINIS
