 The FOXCHACE A Favourite Hunting Song  Sung at the grand Hunts of England  _A SOUTHERLY wind and a cloudy sky  Proclaims a Hunting Morning  Before the sun rises we nimbly fly  Dull sleep and a downybed scorning  To Horse my Boys to Horse away  The Chace admits of no delay  On Horseback we're got together we'll trot  On Horseback we're got together we trot  Leave of your chat see the cover appear  The Hound that strikes first cheer him without fear  Drag on him Ah wind him my steady good hounds  How compleatly the Cover and Furz they draw  Who talks of Barry or Meynell  Young La  her he flourishes now thro' the shaw  And Saucebox roars out in his kennel  Away we fly as quick as thought  The new sown ground soon makes them fault  Cast round the sheeps train cast round ca  round  Try back the deep lane try back try back  Hark I hear some hounds challenge in yonder spring sedge  Comfort Bi  ch hits it off in tha  old thick  edge  Hark forward hark forward have at him my Boys  Hark forward hark forward  don't make a noise  A stormy sky overcharged with rain  Both Hounds and Hunstman opposes  In vain on your mettle you try boys in vain  But down ye must to your noses  Each moment now the sky grows worse  Enough to make a Parson curse  Pick through the plow'd grounds pick through pick through  Well hunted good Hounds well hunted well hunted  If we can but get on we shall soon make him quake  Hark I hear some hounds challenge in the midst of the brake  Talio Talio there across the green plain  Talio Talio Boys have at him again  Thus we ride whip and spur for a two hours Chace  Our Horses go panting and  obbbing  Young Madcap and Riot begin now race  Ride on Sir and give him some mobbing  But hold alass you'll spoil our sport  For thro' the Hounds you'll head him short  Clap round him dear Jack clap round clap round  Hark Drumm  r hark back hark back hark back  He's Jumping and dodging in every bush  Little Riot has fastened her Teeth in his b  ish  Whoo' hoop whoo' hoop he's fairly  down  Whoo' hoop whoo' hoop he's fairly run down
