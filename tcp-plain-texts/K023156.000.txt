 Earl of  BURLINGTON  'TIS strange the Miser should his Cares imploy  To  gain  those Riches he can ne'er  enjoy  Is it less strange the Prodigal should  waste  His Wealth to purchase what he ne'er can  taste  Not for himself he sees or hears or eats  Artists must chuse his Pictures Music Meats  He buys for  Topham  Drawings and Designs  For  Fountain  Statues and for  Curio  Coins  Rare Monkish Manuscripts for  Hearne  alone  And Books for  Mead  and Rarities for  Sloan  Think we all these are for himself no more  Than his fine Wife my Lord or finer Whore  For what has  Virro  painted built and planted  Only to shew  how many  Tastes he wanted  What brought Sir  Shylock  's illgot Wealth to waste  Some Daemon whisper'd "  Knights  shou'd have a  Taste  "  Heav'n visits with a  Taste  the wealthy Fool  And needs no Rod but  S  d  with a Rule  See sportive Fate to punish aukward Pride  Bids  Babo  build and sends him such a Guide  A standing Sermon at each Year's expence  That never Coxcomb reach'd Magnificence  Oft have have you hinted to your Brother Peer  A certain Truth which many buy too dear  Something there is more needful than Expence  And something previous ev'n to Taste'Tis  Sense  Good Sense which only is the Gift of Heav'n  And tho' no Science fairly worth the Seven  A Light which in  yourself  you must perceive  Inigo Jones  Jones  and  The famous Artist who design'd the best Gardens in  France  and plann'd  Greenwich  and St  James  's Parks  c  Le Nôtre  have it not to give  To build to plant whatever you intend  To rear the Column or the Arch to bend  To swell the Terras or to sink the Grot  In all let  Nature  never be forgot  Consult the  Genius  of the  Place  in all  That tells the Waters or to rise or fall  Or helps th' ambitious Hill the Heav'ns to scale  Or scoops in circling Theatres the Vale  Calls in the Country catches opening Glades  Joins willing Woods and varies Shades from Shades  Now breaks or now directs th' intending Lines  Paints  as you plant and as you work  Designs  Begin with  Sense  of ev'ry Art the Soul  Parts answ'ring Parts shall slide into a Whole  Spontaneous Beauties all around advance  Start ev'n from  Difficulty  strike from  Chance  Nature  shall join you  Time  shall make it grow  A Work to wonder atperhaps a  The Seat and Gardens of the Lord Viscount  Cobham  in  Buckinghamshire  STOW  Without it proud  Versailles  thy Glory falls  And  Nero  's Terrasses desert their Walls  The vast  Parterres  a thousand hands shall make  Lo  Bridgman  comes and floats them with a  Lake  Or cut wide  Views  thro' Mountains to the Plain  You'll wish your Hill and shelter'd Seat again  Behold  Villario  's tenyears Toil compleat  His  Quincunx  darkens his Espaliers meet  The Wood supports the Plain the Parts unite  And strength of Shade contends with strength of Light  His bloomy Beds a waving Glow display  Blushing in bright Diversities of Day  With silverquiv'ring Rills maeander'd o'er  Enjoy them you  Villario  can no more  Tir'd of the Scene Parterres and Fountains yield  He finds at last he better likes a Field  Thro' his young Woods how pleas'd  Sabinus  stray'd  Or sate delighted in the thick'ning Shade  With annual Joy the red'ning Shoots to greet  And see the stretching Branches long to meet  His Son's fine Taste an op'ner  Vista  loves  Foe to the  Dryads  of his Father's Groves  One  boundless Green  or  flourish'd Carpet  views  With all the mournful Family of  Yews  The thriving Plants ignoble Broomsticks made  Now sweep those Allies they were born to shade  Yet hence the  Poor  are cloth'd the  Hungry  fed  Health  to himself and to his Infants  Bread  The Lab'rer bears What thy hard Heart denies  Thy charitable Vanity supplies  Another Age shall see the golden Ear  Imbrown thy Slope and nod on thy Parterre  Deep Harvests bury all thy Pride has plann'd  And laughing  Ceres  reassume the Land  At  Timon  's  Villa  let us pass a Day  Where all cry out "What Sums are thrown away  So proud so grand of that stupendous Air  Soft  and  Agreeable  come never there  Greatness with  Timon  dwells in such a Draught  As brings all  Brobdignag  before your Thought  To compass this his Building is a Town  His Pond an Ocean his Parterre a Down  Who but must laugh the Master when he sees  A puny Insect shiv'ring at a Breeze  Lo what huge Heaps of Littleness around  The Whole a labour'd Quarry above ground  Two  Cupids  squirt before A Lake behind  Improves the keenness of the Northern Wind  His  Gardens  next your Admiration call  On ev'ry side you look behold the Wall  No pleasing Intricacies intervene  No artful Wildeness to perplex the Scene  Grove nods at Grove each Ally has a Brother  And half the Platform just reflects the other  The suff'ring Eye inverted Nature sees  Trees cut to Statues Statues thick as Trees  With here a Fountain never to be play'd  And there a Summerhouse that knows no Shade  Here  Amphitrite  sails thro' Myrtle bow'rs  Then  The two famous Statues of the  Gladiator pugnans Gladiator moriens  Gladiators  fight or die in flow'rs  Unwater'd see the drooping Seahorse mourn  And Swallows roost in  Nilus'  dusty Urn  Behold my Lord advances o'er the Green  Smit with the mighty pleasure to be seen  But softby regular approachnot yet  First thro' the length of yon hot Terras sweat  And when up ten steep Slopes you've dragg'd your thighs  Just at his Studydoor he'll bless your Eyes  His  Study  with what Authors is it stor'd  In Books not Authors curious is my Lord  To all their  dated Backs  he turns you round  These  Aldus  printed those  Du Suëil  has  bound  Lo some are  Vellom  and the rest as good  For all his Lordship knows but they are  Wood  For  Lock  or  Milton  'tis in vain to look  These Shelves admit not any Modern book  And now the Chappel's silver bell you hear  That summons you to all the Pride of Pray'r  Light Quirks of Musick broken and uneven  Make the Soul dance upon a Jig to Heaven  On painted Cielings you devoutly stare  Where sprawl the Saints of  Verrio  or  Laguerre  On gilded Clouds in fair expansion lie  And bring all Paradise before your Eye  To Rest the Cushion and soft  Dean  invite  Who never mentions Hell to Ears polite  But hark the chiming Clocks to Dinner call  A hundred Footsteps scrape the marble Hall  The rich Buffet wellcolour'd  Serpents  grace  And gaping  Tritons  spew to wash your Face  Is this a Dinner this a Genial Room  No 'tis a Temple and a Hecatomb  A solemn Sacrifice perform'd in State  You drink by Measure and to Minutes eat  So quick retires each flying Course you'd swear  Sancho  's dread Doctor and his Wand were there  Between each Act the trembling Salvers ring  From Soup to Sweetwine and  God bless the King  In Plenty starving tantaliz'd in State  And complaisantly help'd to all I hate  Treated caress'd and tir'd I take my leave  Sick of his civil Pride from Morn to Eve  I curse such lavish Cost and little Skill  And swear no Day was ever past so ill  In you my  Lord  Taste sanctifies Expence  For Splendor borrows all her Rays from Sense  You show us  Rome  was glorious not profuse  And pompous Buildings once were things of use  Just as they are yet shall your noble Rules  Fill half the Land with  Imitating Fools  Who random Drawings from your Sheets shall take  And of one Beauty many Blunders make  Load some vain Church with old Theatric State  Turn Arcs of Triumph to a Gardengate  Reverse your Ornaments and hang them all  On some patch'd Doghole ek'd with Ends of Wall  Then clap four slices of Pilaster on't  And lac'd with bits of Rustic 'tis a Front  Shall call the Winds thro' long Arcades to roar  Proud to catch cold at a  Venetian  door  Conscious they act a true  Palladian  part  And if they starve they starve by Rules of Art  Yet thou proceed be fallen Arts thy care  Erect new Wonders and the Old repair  Jones  and  Palladio  to themselves restore  And be whate'er  Vitruvius  was before  Till Kings call forth th' Idea's of thy Mind  Proud to accomplish what such hands design'd  Bid Harbors open publick Ways extend  And Temples worthier of the God ascend  Bid the broad Arch the dang'rous Flood contain  The Mole projected break the roaring Main  Back to his bounds their subject Sea command  And roll obedient Rivers thro' the Land  These Honours Peace to happy  Britain  brings  These are Imperial Works and worthy  Kings  FINIS  BOOKS  printed for  LAWTON GILLIVER  at  Homer  's Head over against St  Dunstan  's Church  Fleetstreet  THE
