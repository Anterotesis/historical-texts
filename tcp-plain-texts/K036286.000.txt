former writings of  Thomas Paine  abound with indications of original conception and profound thought of comprehension and sa∣gacity far beyond the vigour of vulgar minds no man I presume of character for intelligence and integrity will venture to deny To the authority of venal sycophants and all the retainers of cor∣rupt and wicked systems whether in  politics  or  religion  no competency can be allowed in a deci∣sion upon this subject but on the contrary the virulence of their abuse is in itself no unequivocal symptom of extraordinary merit just as the screams and tumult of the feathered tribe prove some bird of nobler presence and more ample pi∣nion to be approaching The work which I have undertaken to examine is entitled to particular respect from the circumstances of it's composition  It is the effusion of a pregnant intellect sobered by the meditations of a solitary prison not unat∣tended probably by some apprehensions of such a catastrophe as a crisis of things so novel and event∣ful may daily and hourly be expected to produce The reflections therefore of such a season from so popular a name on a subject of such univer∣sal interest is secure we may presume of consider∣able attention in this country from those who are occupied in the discussion of their  civil  and  religious creed  a number which has certainly in∣creased of late with surprising rapidity and will I hope and believe go on encreasing with an ac∣celerated progress On this account I conceived myself not unlikely to serve the cause of revealed truth by an examination of a deistical pamphlet which seemed so fair a candidate for extensive cir∣culation and I felt the more inclination to this talk not from an arrogant persuasion of superior knowledge and abilities but from a clear con∣viction that  Christianity  CANNOT be vindicated adequately and consistently against  Deism  by any slave of  systems  and  establishments  well aware in the mean time that all my zeal for  Christianity  will not screen me from the malice of those who love  churchemoluments  better than  scripturetruth  because an opportunity will arise of exposing the trumpery and nonsense of  ecclesiastics  The time is come when all our opinions must be tried at the touchstone of severe enquiry and if the  Jewish  and  Christian  Revelations cannot support themselves against the batteries of their assailants in the estimation of capable and disin∣terested judges the outposts must be abandoned and a retreat secured to the fortresses of  deism  al∣ready occupied by the patriarchs of old and the illustrious philosophers of later times The sway of  creeds  and  councils  of  hierarchies  and  churches  whether  Protestant  or  Popish  over the bodies and consciences of men is diminishing apace and the temple of revelation deprived of the mouldering props which priestcraft and tyranny and supersti∣tion had framed for it's support must repose solely on it's proper basis the adamant of TRUTH  After premising a short introduction explana∣tory of his motives to this work our ingenuous author delivers his creed  I believe in one God and no more and I hope for happiness beyond this life  I join the writer in assent to these articles of faith That  Creed  of  Christian Churches  which acknowledges  Jesus Christ  also to be  God  and the  Holy Spirit  to be God is a fundamental violation  of all theology a doctrine alike unknown to the  Heathens  and the  Jews  and contemplated with abhorrence by the followers of  Moses  from it's first propagation to this very day a doctrine incon∣sistent with the plainest declarations of  Christ  himself and his apostles a doctrine which no human testimony whatever could render credible a doctrine which will happily prove a millstone of destruction to all  political  establishments of  christianity  Our author thus proceeds in his confession  I believe the equality of man and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice loving mercy and endeavouring to make our fellowcreatures happy  All diversity of  civil privileges  and  titular dis∣tinctions  all inequality but the transient and ca∣sual inequality produced by personal exertion public benefit or private worth is destitute of even the shadow of support from nature or revela∣tion We are all children of one common father and  Jesus  of  Nazareth  allowed no preeminence among his disciples but that of mutual subjection condescending service profound humility and selfabasement  Matthew xx Romans xii Ephesians v Peter v  of which lowly virtues he pro∣posed  himself as a complete example It requires but a trivial portion of sagacity to discover that certain orders and descriptions of frail creatures encompassed with every inducement to be corrupt  themselves  and plentifully furnished with every means of corrupting  others  cannot be peculiarly calculated to promote the general happiness of mankind and this happiness we are compelled to regard as the prime object of the divine ad∣ministration It was a beautiful sentiment of Plato  Dial v de Republicâ  that  the affairs of states would never be well conducted 'till philosophers were kings or kings philosophers  He who vindicates corruption in society and discountenances a pro∣gress to all perfection of which humanity is capable from the stale topic of the inevitable depravity of human beings discourages every effort for virtu∣ous preeminence degrades the dignity of our nature libels his species and thwarts the mea∣sures of divine government  Christians  at least might be expected to bestow some readiness in their attempts of conforming to the injunctions of their divine teachers by striving to be  perfect  Philippians iii Tim iii    and thoroughly furnished unto all good works  by  leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ and go∣ing on unto  perfection  Hebrews vi    In our present state of embarrassment and degradation from a thousand  causes it were presumptuous ignorance border∣ing on profaneness to prescribe a limit to the ca∣pacities of mortality either in moral or intel∣lectual exertion He at least cannot be deemed  unfriendly  to his species or contemptuous to the divinity who thinks respectably of the workman∣ship of God of the rational image of his Creator  Again  I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church by the Roman church by the Greek church by the Turkish church by the Protestant church nor by any church that I know of My own mind is my own church  This too may be conceded if by  the creed of the Protestant church  be meant that mon∣strous farrago of absurdities and contradictions concentrated with most ingenious and compre∣hensive brevity in the  creeds  denominated the  Athanasian  and  Nicene  which without the expe∣dient of repeating backwards would  "with a vengeance send  "From Media post to Egypt  Paradise Lost iv  "  a much more untractable daemon than Asmodeus  The creed of the holy  Bishop Athanasius  till I am better in∣formed is of too hard a digestion for my charity  Dryden  's preface to his  Religio Laici  or if some clauses even of the  Apostle's creed  were intended by our author clauses which may be  found indeed in the  liturgies  of  established churches  but are certainly not "written in the book of life"  All national institutions of churches whe∣ther Jewish Christian or Turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit  A just remark concisely and pregnantly ex∣pressed  National churches  are that  hay and stubble  Corinthians iii  which might be removed without difficulty or confusion from the fabric of religion by the gentle hand of reformation but which the infa∣tuation of  ecclesiastics  will leave to be destroyed  by fire  verse    National churches  are that incrustation which has enveloped by gradual concretion the diamond of  christianity  nor can I fear the ge∣nuine lustre be restored but by such violent efforts as the separation of substances so long and closely connected must inevitably require  Nor can I forbear the quotation of another pa∣ragraph replete with manly sense and dignified mo∣rality conveyed in simple but energetic language  though not immediately pertinent to the discussion which I have in view especially as fewer occa∣sions of approbation and coincidence will be pre∣sented in our progress through the pamphlet  It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief if I may so express it that mental lying has pro∣duced in society When a man has so far cor∣rupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime He takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain and in order to  qualify  himself for that trade he begins with a perjury Can we conceive any thing more destructive to morality than this  These very rational and important observations are applicable in the fullest latitude to the  subscrip∣tions  exacted from young men at our  Universities  for  degrees  and for the candidates for the ministry in the  Church  of  England  It is a most shocking reflection to every lover of truth and honesty that a requisition to acknowledge a multitudinous mass of  theological  and  political  propositions deno∣minated  articles of religion  which many have never read and which they who read cannot under∣stand that an assent I say to such a monstrous  and unintelligible hodge podge of scholastic reve∣ries should be made an indispensable condition to the privilege of preaching the  truths  of  Christianity  The simplicity and sincerity of the gospel cannot fail of furtherance and support beyond all contro∣versy from those who begin their godly functions in such trifling with veracity and the solemnity of oaths who thus bind themselves to the belief of certain tenets manufactured and imposed by others and thereby preclude themselves in addition to the indirect impediment in the way of acquiring truth interposed by this unequivocal declaration of indifference to her interests from pursuing their theological enquiries beyond the limits assigned by  councils  and  parliaments  in former days by an ex∣press obligation not to exceed the knowledge of their forefathers nor to dispute their opinions whether true or false I cannot myself conceive a case more palpably immoral and indefensible nor can we be surprised at a plenteous harvest of  unbelievers  in a vineyard cultivated by labourers of this complexion  Every national church or religion has establish∣ed itself by pretending some special mission from God communicated to certain individuals The Jews have their Moses the Christians their Jesus Christ their apostles and saints and the Turks  their Mahomet as if the way to God was not open to every man alike  This statement is frivolous and erroneous in the extreme The system of  Jesus Christ  pro∣ceeds upon the very supposition here instituted that "the way to God  is  open to every man alike" as might be proved by many passages in the  Christian  Scriptures What the  Jews  and  Christians  maintain in behalf of their respective sys∣tems is that their founders delivered to man∣kind rational sentiments of the Divine nature of his existence and his providential government of the world at a time when ignorance and deprava∣tion with respect to these fundamental canons of religious rectitude were almost universally predo∣minant With relation to the writings of the  Jews  it is altogether undeniable and is a truth of the ut∣most weight and magnitude that our accumulated discoveries in science and philosophy and all our progress in other parts of knowledge has not en∣abled the wisest of the moderns to excel the noble sentiments conveyed in the didactics and devo∣tional compositions of the  Old Testament  com∣positions many of which existed without dispute before the earliest writings of heathen antiquity and at a period when even those illustrious in∣structors of mankind the  Greeks  and  Romans  were  barbarous and unknown It would gratify me much I confess to be informed in what manner the contemners of the  Jews  and of the  Mosaic  sys∣tem account for this singular  phoenomenon  which indeed might be stated with abundantly more full∣ness and cogency if it were necessary on this oc∣casion Will  Thomas Paine  the  deist  or any of our modern  atheists  undertake the solution of this difficultyBesides let any man compare the sim∣ple morality and the noble precepts of the Gospel as they relate to the attributes of God and the du∣ties of humanity with the monstrous theology with the subtleties and the contradictory schemes of contemporary moralists among the  Greeks  and  Ro∣mans  who nevertheless had in all probability profited mediately or immediately by the  Jewish  system which could not exist without diffusing some influence through the neighbourhood and reflect at the same time that a perfect manual of morality may be collected from a few pages in the gospel but must be picked in  Pagan  writers from a multitude of discordant volumes and a mass of incoherency and absurdity and then condescend to furnish us with an explanation of what must be allowed on all hands a surprising fact namely the existence of such superior intelligence in a  Jewish  carpenter at  Nazareth  So then though we con∣cede to  Mr Paine  that "the way to God was open  to every man alike" we affirm of the  Jewish  and  Christian  dispensations that  they  only were  this way  to any man desirous of entertaining rational no∣tions of God and human duty Without the illu∣mination which has been distributed through the world from these dispensations  Thomas Paine  and other  deists  of our own and succeeding ages who fancy themselves so very philosophical and intelli∣gent in their theology would have known full as little of the matter to speak with moderation as much wiser heads than their's among the illustri∣ous nations of antiquity deprived of these advan∣tages so much contemned and so ungratefully en∣joyed The natural inference from these indubit∣able positions is clearly  some  degree of supernatu∣ral communication which we stile  Revelation  to the founders of  Judaism  and  Christianity Moses  and  Jesus  and the denial of such communica∣tion leaves a problem I apprehend of much more arduous solution but which we may now expect the wonderful disciples of modern reason to ex∣plain in a way that will leave no further difficul∣ties on the subject  As it is necessary to affix right ideas to words I will before I proceed further into the subject offer some observations on the word  revelation  Revelation when applied to religion means  something communicated  immediately  from God to man  No one will deny or dispute the power of the Almighty to make such a communication if he pleases But admitting for the sake of a case that something has been revealed to a certain person and not revealed to any other person it is revelation to that person only When he tells it to a second person a second to a third a third to a fourth and so on it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons It is revelation to the first person only and  hearsay  to every other and consequently they are not obliged to believe it  This statement also is inaccurate fallacious and inconclusive Let us see if we can exhibit a rational and unexceptionable representation of the point in question A revelation is made to one person in the first instance  Moses  for example He communicates this revelation to a  second  party his countrymen the children of  Israel  But does he expect them to believe this message on a mere assertion so that their assent may be stiled a  hearsay  revelation No such thing He delivers his credentials with the message and sanctions his pretensions by some display of  supernatural agency Whether such display were in reality made in the case before us is not now the question I am only exhibiting the proposition in it's proper form and stating the fact as it exists whether authentically or otherwise in the  Mosaic  history and hence I think it is abundantly ma∣nifest that  Mr Paine's  notions of the character and condition of the  Jewish  and  Christian  revela∣tions are so confused as to render his account al∣together unsuitable to the purpose in view and most effectually impertinent And this answer I ap∣prehend will serve for all contained in the suc∣ceeding paragraphs which are also wholly foreign to the subject a mere inapplicable figment of our author's bewildered imagination  It is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call any thing a revelation that comes to us at second hand either verbally or in writing Revelation is necessarily limited to the first communication After this it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to him and though he may find himself obliged to believe it it cannot be incumbent on me to believe it in the same manner for it was not a revelation made to  me  and I have only his word for it that it was made to  him  When Moses told the children of Israel that he received the two tables of the commandments from the hand of God they were not obliged to believe him because they had no other authority for it than his telling them so and I have no other au∣thority for it than some historian telling me so the commandments carrying no internal evi∣dence of divinity with them They contain some good moral precepts such as any man qualified to be a lawgiver or a legislator could produce him∣self without having recourse to supernatural in∣tervention  In a note our author subjoins a sarcastical re∣flection with which his fancy seems not a little tickled and he proposes it accordingly with an air of selfcomplacency and exultation  It is however necessary to except the de∣claration which says that God  visits the sins of the fathers upon the children  It is contrary to every principle of moral justice  But nothing in reality can possibly be more feeble and inefficient than this objection The belief and worship of one true God in oppo∣sition to a plurality of divinities and the vani∣ties of idolatry is the root of all genuine reli∣gion and springs up into that stem upon which  every moral and social duty must be engrafted Now it is most notorious mankind are so entirely the creatures of imitation association and habit that a general prevalence of a false principle in one age has an obvious and unavoidable tendency to transmit this principle with accumulated error and aggravation to the age immediately succeed∣ing  So  Horace  Ode iii  Aetas parentum pejor avis tulit  Nos nequiores mox daturos  Progeniem vitiosiorem  But history and experience uniformly ascer∣tain that while individuals go unpunished large societies and communities of men at least and to the  Jews  in their national capacity were these commandments given are in the regular course of divine administration chastised for their crimes in consequence of the eternal alliance and insep∣arable connection between vice and suffering yet these crimes are not their own crimes merely but the aggregate wickedness of  themselves  and their  progenitors  And with unfeigned sorrow do I regret that  Thomas Paine  should himself be a standing evidence of this immutable dispensa∣tion whilst he lies languishing in prison for an acci∣dental attachment to the  Brissotine  faction without  one personal or political immorality to justify so harsh a treatment  This doctrine "of visiting the sins of the fathers upon the chil∣dren" was seen and acknowledged by the  heathen  moralists So  Horace  Od iii  Delicta majorum immeritus lues  Romane donec templa refeceris  Aedesque labentes deorum et  Foeda nigro simulachra fumo    Our author proceeds  When also I am told that a woman called the Virgin Mary said or gave out that she was with child without any cohabitation with a man and that her betrothed husband Joseph said that an angel told him so I have a right to believe them or not such a circumstance required a much stronger evi∣dence than their bare word for it but we have not even this for neither Joseph nor Mary wrote any such matter themselves It is only reported by others that  they said so  It is hearsay upon hearsay and I do not chuse to rest my be∣lief upon such evidence  These difficulties I concede to the  deist  for my own part in all their force they are pertinent in themselves and of serious significancy to those whom they may concern but as the immaculate conception of  Jesus  by the  Holy Spirit  constitutes no  essential  article of  my  creed and certainly rests  on much weaker evidence than any other impor∣tant fact of all the gospels I leave the vindication of it to the orthodox sons of the establishment In the mean time as one defect of demonstration  Mathemat Princip Philos Nat lib ii prop  has not impaired the general truth of the  Newto∣nian philosophy  not even in the case of that parti∣cular doctrine the propagation of  sounds  so an oc∣casional interpolation of one or two groundless circumstances will not invalidate the evidences of  Christianity  they repose on a much broader and firmer basis than that of detached facts knavish im∣positions on the superstitious and unnecessary mi∣racles For the same reason I shall not scruple to pass unnoticed the subsequent paragraphs of our antagonist which direct their attacks on the wretched materials heaped up for the security of usurped dominion and secular interest by the hands of  priests  and  devotees  a tribe of  Christians  holden by  Mr Paine  and myself in equal vene∣ration  Nothing that is here said can apply even with the most distant disrespect to the  real  character of Jesus Christ He was a virtuous and an ami∣able man The morality that he preached and practised was of the most benevolent kind and  though similar systems of morality had been preached by Confucius and by some of the Greek philosophers many years before by the Quakers since and by many good men in all ages it has not been exceeded by any  Of these remarks the former part is excellent the latter was never surpassed in ignorance and ab∣surdity The  Quakers  undoubtedly take them all in all are as a PRACTICAL society the most re∣spectable of all the religious sects that have come to my knowledge but what can be more su∣premely ridiculous than to exemplify their mora∣lity in contradistinction to that of the  gospel  when they are one and the same To say moreover of the  Christian  system merely that "it has not been exceeded by any" systems ancient or mo∣dern is such a misconception as candour will choose to impute not to malignant disparagement but to an ignorance rather of the philosophical systems of antiquity and the comparative merits of evangelical morality which I fear  Mr Paine  has not examined with a minuteness and scrupulosity that will authorise to a conscientious reasoner such peremptory decision on the case  I wish those heavenly maxims of  Solon  and the son of  Sirach Know thyself  and  Understand first  and then rebuke  were more deeply impressed on the hearts and memories of us all that we might not impose upon ourselves  conceit  for  knowledge  upon our readers  sophistry  for  argument  and  dogmatism  for  intelligent conviction  We are now arrived at the most important parts in my judgement of our author's production to which I shall endeavour to reply directly intelli∣gibly and without evasion and if I should prove unable to vindicate my faith in  Christianity  upon principles truly rational and unambiguously expli∣cit I will relinquish it altogether and look for an asylum in the  deism  of  Thomas Paine  and the  calm philosophy  of  Hume  Jesus Christ wrote no account of himself of his birth parentage or any thing else Not a line of what is called the New Testament is of his writing The history of him is altogether the work of other people and as to the account given of his resurrection and ascension it was the necessary counterpart to the story of his birth His historians having brought him into the world in a supernatural manner were obliged to take him out again in the same manner or the first part of the story must have fallen to the ground  To this argument against the resurrection of  Jesus  various answers might be instituted but I shall confine myself to one only which appears to my mind incapable of confutation upon any prin∣ciples of philosophy or experience and will in∣deed admit of no dispute but upon positions sub∣versive of all historical testimony whatsoever and introductory of universal scepticism  The numerous circumstances interspersed through the  Gospel narratives  and in the  Acts  of the  Apostles  appertaining to the geography of countries the positions of rivers towns and cities public transactions of much notoriety in those days the dress customs manners and languages of na∣tions and individuals political characters of emi∣nence and their conduct with a vast multiplicity of detached occurrences and facts not necessary to be specified at large challenge to speak with mo∣deration as large a portion of credibility to these books considered in the light of  historical  testimo∣nials as can be claimed for any writings what∣ever received as genuine and equally ancient and multifarious Now no mean presumption arises in favour of the most  extraordinary  transactions also blended in the same texture of narrative by histo∣rians of so credible a character with respect to the rest of their relations but when these  extraordi∣nary  facts  are found to have so intimate an incor∣poration with the  common  and unsuspicious occur∣rences of these histories so as to admit of no de∣tachment but to stand or fall with the main body of the compositions I cannot see how any histo∣rical probability of the authenticity of these  extra∣ordinary  events can rise higher than in such an in∣stance But it will be proper to unfold the pur∣port of this reasoning which admits abundant illus∣tration more explicitly by a particular example  The apostles  Peter  and  John  after the death of their Master being summoned before the priests and elders of the  Jews  Acts iv v  boldly assert in their pre∣sence that  God had raised Jesus Christ of Na∣zareth whom the  Jews  had crucified from the dead  After some examination and debate the two  apostles  are commanded by those magi∣strates and rulers of the  Jewish  nation to teach no more in the name of  Jesus  But these intrepid followers of  Jesus  replied in precisely the words of  Socrates  to the  Athenians  In Apol Platonis p ed Ludg Acts v iv    We ought to obey God rather than men for we cannot but speak the things which we have SEEN and HEARD  And what was their prospect and expectation from this determination to perseve∣rance  Nothing less than ridicule contempt per∣secution poverty bodily chastisements imprison∣ment and death  "Starving their gains and martyrdom their price"  Now if we recollect in union with all this what indeed should never be forgotten that these apos∣tles the first teachers of  christianity  the  companions  and  friends  of  Jesus  did not endure these ac∣cumulated inconveniencies from a mere obsti∣nate attachment to  speculative  opinions in which in my opinion they were fallible as other men but for asserting the palpable unquestionable evi∣dence of their  external senses  what "they had  heard  and  seen  and  handled  John i See also Remark xli in my Evidences of Christianity  no alternative of delusion or fallacy can be supposed but their case stands clearly distinguished from that of every  future  victim to religious persuasions liable as they were to no misconstruction no precipitate and prejudiced judgements no conceivable imposture The falshoods therefore of  Christ's  resurrection in connection with this single fact and all the train of collateral circumstances dependant from it would I am persuaded upon any mathematical calcula∣tion of the sum of moral and historical presump∣tion amount to an improbability of the greatest  magnitude indefinitely approximating to a  mira∣culous event  The resurrection and ascension supposing them to have taken place admitted of public and o∣cular demonstration like that of the ascension of a balloon or the sun at noon day to all Je∣rusalem at least A thing which every body is required to believe requires that the proof and evidence of it should be equal to all and universal and as the public visibility of this last related act was the only evidence that could give sanction to the former part the whole of it falls to the ground because that evidence never was given Instead of this a small num∣ber of persons not more than eight or nine are introduced as proxies for the whole world to say they  saw it  and all the rest of the world are called upon to believe it But it appears that Thomas did not believe the resurrection and as they say would not believe without having ocular and manual demonstration himself  So neither will I  and the reason is equally as good for me and for every other person as for Thomas  Farther The demonstration of the  resurrection  may have been sufficiently public to demand our  assent in conjunction with such a variety of cor∣roborating coincidencies though it were not at∣tested by the ocular observation of all Jerusalem which  Mr Paine  supposes to be absolutely necessary to the establishment of this fact The actual degree of publicity however attendant on this * transac∣tion according to the histories may be learned from the texts referred to below  Matthew xxviii Luke xxiv John xx Corinthians xv  Not a thou∣sandth part of the people in  Great Britain  saw  Lunardi  go up from the  Artillery Ground  in a  baloon  but the superior impulse to any possible action upon my mind who saw him in consequence of that event does not exceed the impulse to a simi∣lar action on the mind of another who did  not  see him by an  evanescent infinitesimal  of efficacy The man therefore who is resolved to believe no transaction but upon "ocular and manual de∣monstration" belies his own theory in every movement of his life I might advance also in aid of these remarks that mankind are most evidently placed here in a state of  probationary im∣perfection  that instead of  certainty  for our guide we are compelled to trust on most occasions to degrees of  probability  infinitely diversified and that some of our noblest and most refined excel∣lencies  moral and intellectual spring from a diffidence and docility and lowliness of under∣standing which  disputable evidence  is best calculated to produce Besides that exercise and agitation of our mental powers which is inevitably generated by the delays and difficulties intervening proposi∣tions of this nature and the attainment of moral certainty in a painful disquisition of them contri∣bute essentially to the clearness and vigour and general salubrity of the understanding just as rivers are meliorated and refined by a winding passage over sand and gravel  fontes  liquidi atque exercita cursu  Flumina Virg Geo iii  It might as well be pretended that the faculties of man would be enlarged and his condition improved without the necessity of labour and ingenuity for the sub∣sistence and wellbeing of common life if the trees dropt honey into our mouths if the land flowed with milk and nectar as is fabled of the golden age  Ovid metam i iii  Flumina jam lactis jam flumina nectaris ibant  Flavaque de viridi stillabant ilice mella  There is not more delightful poetry than true philosophy in those lines of  Virgil  Geo i  pater ipse colendi  Haud facilem esse viam voluit primusque per artem  Movit agros curis acuens mortalia corda  Nec torpere gravi passus sua regna veterne  The sire of Gods and men with hard decrees  Forbids our plenty to be bought with ease  And wills that mortal men inur'd to toil  Should exercise with pains the grudging soil  Himself invented first the shining share  And whetted human industry by care  Himself did handycraft and arts ordain  Nor suffered sloth to rust his active reign  DRYDEN    The declaration therefore of  Christ  is no fana∣tical ejaculation but a position strictly philoso∣phical and intrinsically wise  Thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have  not seen  and yet have be∣lieved  John xx    No considerate and inquisitive christian will pretend that he sees the truth of his master's re∣surrection and the system supported by it with the same intuition which perceives the equality of the  three angles  of a  triangle  to one  right angle  He is satisfied with thinking an acquiescence in this grand doctrine strictly rational and philoso∣phical if he descries it's indissoluble connection with other numerous occurrences of the highest probability if it forms a most important link in one concatenated series of divine communications dignified and important in themselves corrobo∣rated by contemporary histories and ascertained almost to demonstration by the preceding and  present existing circumstances of mankind at large if in short nothing can be discovered in such a system unfit for man to receive or the Creator to bestow but on the contrary innumerable indica∣cations present themselves of that benevolence to the human race which is to us the most convincing characteristic of the divinity  It is vain to attempt to palliate or disguise this matter The story so far as relates to the supernatural part has every mark of fraud and imposition stamped upon the face of it Who were the authors of it is as impossible for us to know as it is for us to be assured that the books in which the account is related were written by the persons whose names they bear The best surviving evidence we now have respecting this affair is the Jews They are regularly descended from the people who lived in the times this re∣surrection and ascension is said to have happen∣ed and they say  it is not true  It has long appeared to me a strange inconsistency to cite the Jews as a proof of the truth of the story It is just the same as if a man were to say I will prove the truth of what I have told you by producing the people who say it is false  That the story of the resurrection  has every mark of fraud and imposition stamped upon the  of it  is the hardy assertion of one who must be deemed to have nothing better to offer than  hardy assertion  'till he present us with a deduction of particulars in vindication of his confidence and if the books should  not  be written in reality by those identical persons whose names are affixed the truth of the facts themselves is deducible from a mass of collateral and independent evidence And with respect to the incredulity of the  Jews  many satisfactory reasons may be alledged I have been assured indeed and upon authority exceed∣ingly respectable that in the written annals of the  Israelitish  nation reposited at  Venice  and  Amster∣dam two  miracles of  Jesus  stand recorded one of which is the resuscitation of the widow's son at  Nain  Luke vii ii  but I would not wish this argument to pass for more than it's proper value It is how∣ever acknowledged by the  Jews  that such a per∣son as  Jesus  of  Nazareth  existed  See Bishop Lowth's note on Isaiah liii  and at the time assigned by the  Evangelists  but motives numerous and highly probable may be suggested for their rejection of him The  Jewish  nation were ex∣pecting a magnificent leader and glorious conquer∣or not an obscure  Nazarene  and humble teacher of religion they were at that time as appears from their countryman  Josephus  and from the  Roman  and  Evangelical  historians a people ex∣ceedingly vicious and depraved their leading men with their chief priest and scribes whose opinions and authority swayed the whole nation according to the custom of corrupt communities hated and reviled  Jesus  not only for that simpli∣city and purity of life which read a lecture of tacit reprobation to their ostentatious and immoral characters but much more from his public and unreserved reproof of their ignorance their ty∣ranny their selfishness their extortion and hy∣pocrisy Now if it should be rejoined to these allegations and nothing else discoverable by me can be rejoined that  miracles  if  Jesus  really per∣formed them would not have failed to overpower their prejudices and animosity I reply  first  that the  Jews  who admitted the possibility of working miracles by a confederacy with evil spirits and a skill in magical operations  This is manifest from  Josephus  as well as various passages of the  NewTestament  would much more easily take refuge in that popular solution than surrender their emoluments their vices and their religious professions entwined as these were with great intellectual depravity than offer up such costly sacrifices to the name and authority of a detested Censor And  secondly  daily expe∣rience  presents us with innumerable instances of a perseverance in vice and folly which the unhappy victims of this tyranny are in their own minds fully assured will as inevitably terminate in wretched∣ness and destruction as if the evidence of such an issue were ascertained by a  miracle  But the subject before us admits of further illus∣tration from the example of  Mr Paine  himself In this country where his opposition to the corrup∣tions of government has raised him so many ad∣versaries and such a swarm of unprincipled hire∣lings have exerted themselves in blackening his character and in misrepresenting all the transac∣tions and incidents of his life will it not be a most difficult nay an impossible task for posterity after a lapse of years if such a wreck of modern literature as that of the ancient should intervene to identify the real circumstances moral and civil of the man And would a true historian such as the  evangelists  be credited at that future period against such a predominant incredulity without large and weighty accessions of collateral attesta∣tion And how transcendently extraordinary I had almost said  miraculous  will it be esteemed by candid and reasonable minds that a writer whose object was a melioration of condition to the com∣mon people and their deliverance from oppression  poverty and wretchedness to the numberless bles∣sings of upright and equal government should be reviled persecuted and burned in essigy with every circumstance of insult and execration by these very objects of his benevolent intentions in every corner of the kingdom  Upon the whole we find no difficulty in declar∣ing that what has astonished  Mr Paine  so long should astonish him no longer as no species of reasoning is more common and more legitimate than that which proves the truth of a circumstance from the evidence of corrupt and interested wit∣nesses who assert it to be false The very denial of such a people as the  Jews  is no mean presump∣tion in favour of the character of  Jesus  Indeed  Mr Paine  pleads this cause with so much ability in our favour and against himself that I should be unpardonable in withholding the next paragraph replete with cogency and good sense from the notice of the reader  That such a person as Jesus Christ existed and that he was crucified which was the mode of execution at that day are historical relations strictly within the limits of probability He preached most excellent morality and the equa∣lity of man but he preached also against the  corruptions and avarice of the Jewish priests and this brought upon him the hatred and ven∣geance of the whole order of the priesthood  In the following pages from p to p  Mr Paine  enters into what he calls  a bold in∣vestigation and which he apprehends will alarm many  Upon this topic of discussion our au∣thor fancies himself no doubt extremely eloquent and instead of plain sensible  Thomas Paine  he commences a tumid and hypertragical declaimer A most formidable and pompous representation is exhibited of the  devil  with a detail of the battles the transformations the imprisonment and other strange adventures of his  Satanic  majesty All this I grant may swell into a serious difficulty with good  churchmen  and puritanical fanatics but to myself and others of the same orthodox standard occasion no embarrassment at all being received with exactly the degree of credit vouchsafed them by  Thomas Paine  himself The whole fable of the  Devil  and his angels with all it's terrific appen∣dages has been gratuitously fabricated by the sons of superstition from one or two emblematical pas∣sages in the  Revelations  where the author has de∣lineated future characters and events under the guise of these fictitious personages No legiti∣mate rules of interpretation and no circumstances  of the  Jewish  or  Christian  systems make it neces∣sary for us to regard the  Devil  or  Satan  in any other light than that of an  allegorical character  This mode of  personification  was perfectly suited to the taste of the  orientals  who delighted in speak∣ing not only in striking metaphors but by  actions  and whose compositions are a tissue of figurative and emblematical expression The origin of evil moral and natural is a problem which has exer∣cised the ingenuity of man since the creation of the world and the  Hebrews  relieved the distress of mind resulting from these disquisitions by per∣sonifying the  evil principle  under the denomina∣tion of  Satan  or the  enemy  The  Greeks  also had recourse to a similar contrivance for their satisfac∣tion on this point and employed  Ate  the  Furies  and other malignant deities as convenient substi∣tutes for  the origin of evil  See Homer's Iliad xix  Nor were similar fic∣tions with a view to the same embarrassment un∣known to the followers of  Confucius  and  Zoroaster  to the natives of  Peru  and  Mexico  But  Mr Paine's  information upon the subject of modern theology must be very slender indeed or he would have known that those who have distinguished them∣selves of late years by the freedom of scriptural re∣search unfettered by the chicanery and bribery  of  establishments  have exploded these monstrous doctrines which receive no real countenance from the genius of the  Christian  covenant or the sense of scripture and will soon have no existence but in the creeds of  Dames  and  Nurses  Alass our  Deist  fancied himself in stout combat with genuine  Christianity  whilst he was buffeting a mere phan∣tom of ignorance and superstition So easy is de∣clamation against folly  These books beginning with Genesis and ending with Revelations which by the bye is a book of riddles that requires a Revelation to explain it are we are told the word of God  The vindicator who occupies himself in the confutation of such unsupported and dogmatical assertions is not much more excusable than the  ignoramus  who has the audacity to produce them I thus express myself with unreserved censure upon a probability of the highest kind that  Mr Paine  never studied the  apocalypse  with an express view of deciding upon the authenticity of that sin∣gular composition When he has done this and is able to invalidate merely those incontrovertible  internal  symptoms of genuineness which the syn∣chronisms the curious coincidences and arrange∣ment of the parts detected and elucidated with  such incomparable skill and clearness by  Joseph Mede  carry with them to every dispassionate exa∣miner it will then be proper and seasonable to dis∣cuss the allegations of our deist But that the random fiction of a distempered brain should be marked with such characters of truth as are found on the face of the  apocalypse  is to me perfectly inconceivable  When the church mythologists established their system they collected all the writings they could find and managed them as they pleased It is a matter altogether of uncertainty to us whether such of the writings as now appear under the name of the Old and the New Testa∣ment are in the same state in which those col∣lectors say they found them or whether they added altered abridged or dressed them up  Be this as it may they decided by  vote  which of the books out of the collection they had made should be the WORD OF GOD and which should not They rejected several they voted others to be doubtful such as the books called the Apocrypha and those books which had a majority of votes were voted to be the word of God Had they voted otherwise all the peo∣ple since calling themselves Christians had be∣lieved  otherwise for the belief of the one comes from the vote of the other Who the people were that did all this we know nothing of they called themselves by the general name of the church and this is all we know of the matter  In answer to this undigested and inaccurate state∣ment of the case I observe as follows It is most certain and ought not to be dissembled that  all  the books of the  Old  and  New Testaments  have not come confirmed to us by the same degree of evi∣dence They may be properly distributed into two classes Books of  Fact  and Books of  Opinion  Under the former class I would comprise from  Ge∣nesis  to the book of  Job  with the  Gospels  and  Acts  of the  Apostles  and under the latter to make the largest concession to this argument the  Hagio∣grapha  and  Prophets  i e all the remainder of the  Old Testament  with the  Epistles  and  Apocalypse  of the  New  Now that we may wave all discussion of the evidences and importance of the latter col∣lection the  Christian  and  Jewish  systems need no support beyond the authenticity of the  historic  class and I assert in the fullest confidence and appeal to a multitude of publications in behalf of this assertion that no history whatever taking it's antiquity into consideration has more claims to be  received as genuine than the histories in question And what need of circumstantial detail in repelling the objections of men who really know just nothing of the subject and satisfy their  reason  and  philo∣sophy  by peremptory asseveration only unillumi∣nated by one single ray of information on the topic in dispute  I have long had in contemplation a work relative to the authen∣ticity of the  Old Testament  similar to my  Evidences of Christianity  which I hope some day to execute  To contravene positions that have been discussed again and again by writers of the first genius and erudition and to disparage the ge∣nuineness of the  bible histories  wholly and indiscri∣minately without some precision of investigation some specific allegations founded on the report of authentic documents is intolerable arrogance and the consummation of literary profligacy With respect to the  internal  evidences of these  histories  I am persuaded and would engage to prove in de∣tail that they are exceedingly superior to those of any ancient records whatever whose authenticity is admitted evidences of which no man will doubt who does not insist on  mathematical demonstration  in cases only susceptible of varying  probabilities  However this be it is my settled persuasion de∣duced from experience and the manners of man∣kind that if no  written memorials  of the  Jewish  and  Christian  dispensations were at this moment in  existence the present condition of the professors of these systems as a traduction of believers in a certain system composing vast aggregates of men through a succession of ages in a variety of instan∣ces persecuted distressed and destroyed for their belief cannot be accounted for but on a suppo∣sition of the original reasonableness of these dis∣pensations in the apprehensions of the  first  profes∣sors and consequently of their probable authen∣ticity unless indeed we are resolved to exempt the men of those aeras from the common benefits of ra∣tionality It were most easy to enlarge on this subject but more has been said already than such desultory and unsubstantiated allegations have any reason to expect and I shall only add from a multiplicity of cogent instances with reference to  one  branch of evidence of the first moment that a comparison of the xxviii chapter of  Deuteronomy  only with the subsequent and present state of the  Israelitish  nation must slash conviction I should think upon any mind not totally prejudiced and perverted in favour of the  prophetical  pretensions of the  Scriptures  for that the book of  Deuteronomy  was composed  posterior  to these events what effron∣tery even of unlearned  deism  if it hazard the asser∣tion will undertake to prove  Revelation is a communication of something which the person to whom that thing is revealed  did not know before For if I have done a thing or seen it done it needs no revelation to tell me I have done it or seen it nor to enable me to tell it or to write it  This is not only the  essence  but the  quintessence  of all weakness and absurdity and affords a me∣lancholy instance how men of real genius and abi∣lities must expose themselves when they venture to discuss subjects of the highest moment for which they are qualified neither by reading nor reflexion Such presumption is no other than the case simply but pointedly described by the apostle  Profes∣sing themselves to be wise they become fools  Romans i    Mr Paine  has given us a notable definition truly in which the term to be explained constitutes a part But to pass by this stupidity how sayest thou child of reason  Revelation is a commu∣nication of something unknown before  So then not only the professors of philosophy at the higher places of education but every dame that teaches the  hornbook  in a country village com∣municates it seems a  revelation  And the man who so defines and so conceives and upon the strength of such definition and conception talks  about it and about it  with all the fullness of selfsuffi∣ciency is able it should seem to demolish  Judaism  and  Christianity  with a few dashes of  his  pen and to establish mere deism on their ruins  "How would our fathers rise up in a rage  "And swear all shame is lost in  George's  age"  What our redoubtable antagonist immediately subjoins savours of equal imbecillity and total misapprehension of the subject under contempla∣tion The greater part of the  biblehistory  con∣tains simply a narrative of the  political  occurrences of the  Jews  and the transactions recorded are therefore in a variety of instances to be consider∣ed in the same light with those of all other histories namely as aggravated and disguised in a thousand instances by passing through the medium of na∣tional partiality The history of  Sampson  is on this account to be credited in proportion only to that degree of probability measured by the com∣mon experience of mankind and the state of the world in those days which the history itself shall claim in the estimation of reasonable judges un∣der such qualifications and deductions as will by no means invalidate the main body and the leading facts of the narrative in the light of a national re∣gister of persons and events  I agree with  Thomas Paine  that  the account of the creation with which the book of Genesis  opens has all the appearance of being a tradi∣tion which the Israelites had among them be∣fore they came into Egypt and after their de∣parture from that country they put it at the head of their history without telling as it is most probable that they did not know how they came by it  But what majesty of sentiment what a dignified simplicity of expression characterises the  Mosaic  ac∣count of the creation of the world Compare only this elegant and compendious relation with the strange confused and despicable  cosmogonies  of the  Greeks  for it is manifest from internal evidence that  Ovid's  beautiful description was constructed upon the  Mosaic  narrative nor otherwise is it pro∣bable that the literary  Romans  of the  Augustan  age should be strangers to the  Greek  translation of the  Old Testament  Fuscus Aristius  to whom  Horace  addresses the d Ode of the  first  Book and his  tenth  Epistle one of the most intimate and beloved friends of the Poet was either a native  Jew  or a  proselyte  compare Sat i    To all that occurs between pages and as far as they comprehend any objections to the  Jewish  institution a very satisfactory answer has if I mistake not been already given One pre∣dominant  error in page it may not be unseason able to detect  Mr Paine  there asserts  Why it has been called the Mosaic account of the creation I am at a loss to conceive Mo∣ses I believe was too good a judge of such sub∣jects to put his name to that account He had been educated among the Egyptians who were a people as well skilled in science and particularly in astronomy as any people of their day  All this may be literally true but a palpable  untruth  is implied in it that the  Aegyptians  were really a learned and scientific people whereas their science and their astronomy was just nothing at all If not produce me your vouchers to this fact from existing monuments or ancient testimony  See a posthumous dissertation by  Dr Woodward  in the  Arch∣aeologia  of the Society of Antiquaries vol iv dissert  Political society was undoubtedly existing in much stability and regularity at a very early period in  AEgypt  but probably not earlier than in  China  and  Indostan  or perhaps other pleasant and fertile countries of the  East  but where shall we find the scientific discoveries of all or any of these people at the  Mosaic  aera The only circumstance which has fallen to my knowledge that is favourable to the science of the  Aegyptians  but in much later ages  is that eagerness with which the  Grecian  sages travelled for information to this country But the  Aegyptian  priests like priests of other ages cajoled mankind with juggling tricks mysterious mythologies lying legends of gods and heroes and an imaginary chronology dependant on pretended observations of  eclipses  and I ap∣prehend the acquisitions of the Greeks from this peregrination were no more than the general ac∣quisitions of modern travellers and those of  Ulysses  in ancient times who as we learn from  Pope's  translation of the  Odossey  "Wandering from clime to clime observant stray'd  "Their manners noted and their states survey'd"  The few elementary propositions in  geometry  which are ascribed to  Pythagoras  and  Plato  ought not to be imputed in all probability to any com∣munications from the  Aegyptians  but were the pure inventions of those most acute and godlike philosophers Yes such men as  Plato  and  Pytha∣goras  would either have learned more or have learned nothing from the  Aegyptians  Not a day passes however but authors are trumpeting the  science  of the  Aegyptians  upon all occasions a science which has no existence but in the miscon∣ceptions of their own brain and the creeds of their  teachers And these  deists  after all laugh at  Chris∣tians  forfooth for their credulity  If we permit ourselves to conceive right ideas of things we must necessarily affix the idea not only of unchangeableness but of the utter impossibility of any change taking place by any means or accident whatever in that which we would honour with the name of the word of God and therefore the word of God cannot exist in any written or human language  What can be more frivolous and more unwor∣thy of a man of sense A revelation we sup∣pose is first conveyed to a particular person he proposes it with the proofs of his mission to others they transmit the same by tradition and written records to their posterity It is acknowledged that no succeeding evidence to future generations can strictly authorize that most indubitable con∣viction of the first immediate professor but even  their  evidence may approximate to certainty be∣yond any assignable limits so as to amount to a species of persuasion from a concurrence of corroborating particulars which is morally irre∣sistible Who even at this day can be assured that  Michael Angelo  planned the fabric of  St Peter's  at  Rome  or  Sir Christopher Wren St Paul's  in  London  with a satisfaction equal to that of the contemporaries of these transactions And yet what man in his senses entertains the least doubt of these respective facts And so it  may be  with respect to the  Jewish  and  Christian  revelations and so it  is  notwithstanding any arguments of  Mr Paine  A few mistakes of copyists and prin∣ters make no more alteration in the  general  effect of this argument than a new stone or pinnacle repaired will be deemed to abolish the pretensions of the primary architect to his structure  I now go on to the book called the New Testament The  new  Testament that is the  new  Will as if there could be two wills of the Creator  Scarcely a single  Christian  can be found I be∣lieve so totally ignorant and untutored as not to know that the  New Covenant  is the proper title of this book Most completely ridiculous then does  Mr Paine  make himself by his serious con∣test with vulgar and exploded errors A plain demonstration this how little of what is new and important  he  has to bring forward on these long agitated disquisitions  From p to not an  iota  of remark is to be discovered that does not disgrace the meanest understanding and no objection that a schoolboy could not confute My countrymen must be degenerated into a  swinish multitude  indeed to find any nutriment in such a mess of pigsmeat as these wretched caterers  David Andrews  and  Thomas Paine  have provided for them But what better can be expected from  zeal  without  knowledge  Nothing indeed but dogmatism mis∣representation nonsense and obscurity In short to employ our author's own words in p  I become so tired with examining into the in∣consistencies and absurdities of  Thomas Paine's  effusion that I hasten to the conclusion of it in order to proceed  but on very unpromising speculation of success "to something better"  It is most true as our author asserts in p  The church has set up a system of religion very contradictory to the character of the person whose name it bears It has set up a religion of pomp and of revenue in pretended imita∣tion of a person whose life was humility and poverty  yet according to the stale but just maxim whose dictates  Mr Paine  has so inces∣santly and egregiously violated in this crude production  ab abusu ad usum non valet conse∣quentia  quentia  these  corruptions  are not chargeable on the spirit of  true christianity  the argument will not infer from  perverted revelation  to  no revela∣tion  at all No there are we trust such things in being as  truth philosophy  and  revealed religion  in spite of  lying Chroniclers imaginary system∣mongers  and  meretricious theologians  Your notion of  redemption  upon which you so largely expatiate and so tragically declaim in the following pages is the notion derived probably from your  quaker  father and the good fraternity among whom you received your education but is not the notion of the scriptures Our doc∣trine is that God created man pure and upright with a capacity of conforming himself in all res∣pects to the injunctions of the divine will  So  Solomon  Lo this only have I found that God hath made man upright but they have sought out many inventors  Ecclesiastes vii  that life without cessation was the proposed reward of unfailing obedience and death the punishment of transgression Man deviated from the line of rec∣titude by listening to the seductions of wayward appetite and became justly exposed to the penalty denounced against sin His heavenly father who in the midst of judgement remembers mercy and  delights through the whole conduct of his pro∣vidential administrations to mankind in educing good from evil renews his covenant with his fallen creatures promises to reverse this sentence of death and to reestablish him in his claim to immortality by means of another dispensation at a future season which appeared to divine wisdom the best calculated for it's promulgation Ac∣cordingly in the fulness of time after a prepara∣tory system whose chief object was the establish∣ment of a belief in one God in opposition to the corruptions of idolworship  Jesus  of  Nazareth  was commissioned to preach in  Judea  the terms of acceptance with the Almighty These were a belief and practice of the doctrines which this apostle preached and confirmed by miracles the doctrines of unbounded mercy on the part of God upon repentance and reformation and of univer∣sal undistinguishing benevolence on the part of man to all his brethren of the human race prin∣ciples essential in themselves to the virtue and happiness of mankind and therefore required as the conditions of divine favour by this system of revelation Thus was the inestimable privilege of immortality again indulged to the world and  Jesus  himself was propounded as the  voucher  of this truth Hence manifestly appears the rea∣son  why he did not  die of a fever or of the smallpox of old age  Page of  Mr Paine's  Pamphlet    or in any private customary manner but by a public exhibition of death upon a cross that he whose resurrection had been previously appointed by himself for the test and demonstration of the whole  christian system  as it related to the destruction of death and the gift of immortality might be shown to the world unequivocally and indubitably  dead  See Remark xliii in my evidences of  Christianity  Had  Jesus  died in any of the ways pointed out by the wisdom of  Mr Paine  we should have been called upon to clear the suspicions of collusion and imposture from the privacy of that event  This may be regarded as a brief abstract of the  evangelical  scheme of redemption according to my conception of it a scheme which admits of abundant illustration and establishment from a multiplicity of considerations conformable alike to reason philosophy and experience but nei∣ther does the present occasion permit nor the weight of  Mr Paine's  objections require a more copious display or a more scrupulous corrobo∣ration of our creed  In page you say  Jesus Christ could speak but one language which was Hebrew  with as much confidence as if you had been personally ac∣quainted  with him Now my opinion is that the inhabitants of  Judea  and the greater part of the  Roman  empire understood  Greek  also as well and generally as the  Irish  understand  English  but what claim have those who decide without know∣ledge to any satisfaction on this point My wish is to excite in the deistical lovers of truth a desire to examine for themselves a sober estimate of their own acquirements and a modest persuasion that the disciples of  Christ  may have  some  reasons not wholly puerile and inefficient for their attachment to their religion and I recommend in the mean time to the consideration of the  atheist  if such men really exist which I doubt exceedingly what  Mr Paine  advances in the th and following pages and at the conclusion of his pamphlet I know not whether  Mr Paine's  remarks on the languages of the ancients  Page and the following  can be thought worthy of any ani∣madversion as we pass I observe however that as all men have not that docility and humility of mind which is essential to an acceptance of  Christi∣anity  but wrap themselves up in a cloak of igno∣rance and selfsufficiency so neither have all that sensibility of perception and that elegance of taste which is necessary to a relish of the inimitable beau∣ties of ancient composition I may be for exam∣ple a delicate bird delighting in strawberries and  the choicest fruits  Thomas Paine  a crow who prefers a feast on carrion and putrescence The genius and faculties of men are diversified with in finite shades of texture and it seems to be the duty of every individual to prosecute that branch of literature with peculiar devotion for which na∣ture has peculiarly fitted him Poetical inspira∣tion and the powers of eloquence were not given by God without some wise intention with respect both to the possessor and mankind at large  Nec tua laudabis studia aut aliena reprendes  is a sensible and valuable maxim of an  Augustan  poet The compositions of the  Greeks  and  Ro∣mans  stand as yet unrivalled in the universe and their admirers are much confirmed in their attach∣ment when they perceive their censurers to be those who know little or nothing of the subject themselves and scruple not to incur an imputa∣tion of most contemptible impertinence for so ir∣rational an interposition of their judgement Be∣sides I have not yet discovered that the best phi∣lologists are generally inferior in any  other  branch of knowledge to the wiseacres who undervalue these attainments merely because they have not the means of acquisition Have the cultivators of the languages more natural powers therefore than other men By no means but their youth  has been happily exercised in those pursuits in which youth can only be occupied very generally speaking with complete efficiency In all that  Mr Paine  has said on this subject I discern little more than a collection of ignorance misconcep∣tion effrontery and insipidity  The event that served more than any other to break the first link in this long chain of des∣potic ignorance is that known by the name of the reformation by Luther From that time though it does not appear to have made any part of the intention of Luther or of those who are called reformers the Sciences began to re∣vive and Liberality their natural associate be∣gan to appear  The reformation arose from an insight into the corruptions and absurdities of Popery in conse∣quence of a freedom of enquiry already commen∣cing and a steady conviction of servility dis∣graceful to a rational being in a submission of the understanding to the arbitrary dictates of a spiri∣tual usurper The reformation therefore by  Lu∣ther  was only one circumstance in the recovery of the natural right of man to think and determine for himself But the benefits of the reformation were momentous and extensive and particularly  by removing those apprehensions of personal dan∣ger which debarred all progress to true philoso∣phy in countries where the  Papal  domination was established And surely it forms no mean pre∣sumption in favour of the reasonableness of reve∣lation that the restoration of science and the recti∣fication of religion should be congenial and con∣temporary that the beams of knowledge should dispel the damps and darkness of ignorant supersti∣tion but contribute illumination and vigour to the sincere gospel of  Jesus Christ  The most distin∣guished mathematicians and philosophers of our own country  Bacon Boyle Newton Locke Barrow  and  Hartley  have been the firmest believers of the  Christian  revelation and not passive educational believers merely accepting with implicit acqui∣escence the traditionary creeds of their teachers but strenuous assertors and most able vindicators of the authority the importance and the rationality of the  gospel  I would recommend to the notice of  Thomas Paine  the following passage in the life of  Emlyn  See my Evidences Remark xxxix    Dr Halley  said  Sir Isaac Newton  I am always glad to hear you when you speak about  astronomy  or other parts of  mathematics  because that is a subject you have studied and well understand but you should not talk of  Christianity  for you have not studied it I  have and know you know nothing o  the matter  Mr Paine  descants with a tolerable share of merriment in page on the story of  Jonah  and the  Whale  which my own stomach also feels an equal indisposition to ingurgitate It is not un∣like a tale that I lately heard which many will think not inferior to that before us in symptoms of credibility A little blackboy a favourite with the ship's company as he was carelessly sitting with his bread and cheese suddenly fell overboard and was instantly swallowed by an immense shark Some sailors witnesses of this catastrophe ex∣claimed "Caesar is devoured by a shark" The captain immediately commanded a hook to be baited with a huge piece of beef which the mons∣ter seized at once with the utmost rapacity He was drawn with difficulty upon deck his tail cut off to prevent mischief and the most trembling precaution used in opening his stomach for fear of wounding it's inestimable contents But how great was their admiration and delight to discover little  Caesar  perched on a tubercle of the purte∣nance dispatching his bread and cheese in perfect composure and security  I have now finished my remarks on this pamph∣let of  Thomas Paine  which have been extended  thus far more in deference to the deserved cele∣brity of the name than the powers of the disputant nor am I conscious to myself of eluding any diffi∣culty or shrinking from the terrors of a single ar∣gument in the course of this examination To the best of my ability a concise answer to every objec∣tion not completely puerile has been specifically given or is virtually included in this series of ob∣servations Nor in conclusion will I dissemble one of my most urgent inducements to this publi∣cation to have been an ambition to declare to my fellowcitizens in the most unreserved manner that one in the midst of a general obloquy on reform∣ers as infidels and atheists is indeed a zealous ad∣vocate for  Christianity  but as becomes the disci∣ple of a  lowly  and pacific master with as warm an enthusiasm for the universal equality and the una∣lienable rights of man as ever actuated the breast even of the "hallowed MILTON" The more perilous the times with the more animation will a genuine votary of a crucified Saviour who "looks for a better country that is a heavenly  Hebrews xi  " feel himself impelled to a bold and open profes∣sion of the practical principles of his religion the principles of LOVE and PEACE and LIBERTY without distinction to the whole human race  This is the profession of our faith before atheists and unbelievers before ministers and kings from this profession neither shall shame seduce nor danger terrify It shall be our guide through life our support in death and we trust our re∣compense for ever  I implore finally the omnipotent controller of events who  ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will  Daniel iv    to con∣sider his creature man in this most momentous crisis of our affairs to stem that torrent of human blood which is deluging the earth at the will of  Christian  kings beyond all example in the most ferocious ages of heathenism and barbarity to confound the devices of all sanguinary destroyers of mankind combined against liberty and know∣ledge the true "synagogues of Satan  Revelations ii  " and to turn their hearts to annihilate every sentiment of national hostility in every breast that the horrid circumstances of war and slaughter may no where exist but in the bloody page of history as awful memorials of
