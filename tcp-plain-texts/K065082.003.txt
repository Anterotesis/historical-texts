System of Constantine and his SuccessorsMilitary DisciplineThe PalaceThe Finances  THE unfortunate Licinius was the last rival who opposed the greatness and the last captive who adorned the triumph of Constantine After a tranquil and prosperous reign the Conqueror bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the Roman Empire a new capital a new policy and a new religion and the innovations which he established have been embraced and consecrated by succeeding generations The age of the great Constantine and his sons is filled with important events but the historian must be oppressed by their number and variety  unless he diligently separates from each other the scenes which are connected only by the order of time He will describe the political institutions that gave strength and stability to the empire before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions which hastened its decline He will adopt the division unknown to the ancients of civil and ecclesiastical affairs the victory of the Christians and their intestine discord will supply copious and distinct materials both for edification and for scandal  After the defeat and abdication of Licinius  Design of a new capital  his victorious rival proceeded to lay the foundations of a city destined to reign in future times  A D  the mistress of the East and to survive the empire and religion of Constantine The motives whether of pride or of policy which first induced Diocletian to withdraw himself from the ancient seat of government had acquired additional weight by the example of his successors and the habits of forty years Rome was insensibly confounded with the dependent kingdoms which had once acknowledged her supremacy and the country of the Caesars was viewed with cold indifference by a martial prince born in the neighbourhood of the Danube educated in the courts and armies of Asia and invested with the purple by the legions of Britain The Italians who had received Constantine as their deliverer submissively obeyed the edicts which he sometimes condescended to address to the senate and people of Rome but they were seldom honoured with the presence of their new sovereign During the vigour  of his age Constantine according to the various exigencies of peace and war moved with slow dignity or with active diligence along the frontiers of his extensive dominions and was always prepared to take the field either against a foreign or a domestic enemy But as he gradually reached the summit of prosperity and the decline of life he began to meditate the design of fixing in a more permanent station the strength as well as majesty of the throne In the choice of an advantageous situation he preferred the confines of Europe and Asia to curb with a powerful arm the barbarians who dwelt between the Danube and the Tanais to watch with an eye of jealousy the conduct of the Persian monarch who indignantly supported the yoke of an ignominious treaty With these views Diocletian had selected and embellished the residence of Nicomedia but the memory of Diocletian was justly abhorred by the protector of the church and Constantine was not insensible to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the glory of his own name During the late operations of the war against Licinius he had sufficient opportunity to contemplate both as a soldier and as a statesman the incomparable position of Byzantium and to  Situation of Byzantium  observe how strongly it was guarded by nature against an hostile attack whilst it was accessible on every side to the benefits of commercial intercourse Many ages before Constantine one of the most judicious historians of antiquity  Polybius l iv p edit Casaubon He observes that the peace of the Byzantines was frequently disturbed and the extent of their territory contracted by the inroads of the wild Thracians  had described the advantages of a situation from whence a feeble colony of Greeks derived the command of the sea and the honours of a flourishing and independent republic  The navigator Byzas who was styled the son of Neptune founded the city years before the Christian Aera His followers were drawn from Argos and Megara Byzantium was afterwards rebuilt and fortified by the Spartan general Pausanias See Scaliger Animadvers ad Euseb p Ducange Constantinopolis l i part i cap With regard to the wars of the Byzantines against Philip the Gauls and the kings of Bithynia we should trust none but the ancient writers who lived before the greatness of the imperial city had excited a spirit of flattery and fiction    If we survey Byzantium in the extent which it  Description of CONSTANTINOPLE  acquired with the august name of Constantinople the figure of the imperial city may be represented under that of an unequal triangle The obtuse point which advances towards the east and the shores of Asia meets and repels the waves of the Thracian Bosphorus The northern side of the city is bounded by the harbour and the southern is washed by the Propontis or sea of Marmara The basis of the triangle is opposed to the west and terminates the continent of Europe But the admirable form and division of the circumjacent land and water cannot without a more ample explanation be clearly or sufficiently understood  The winding channel through which the waters  The Bolphorus  of the Euxine flow with a rapid and incessant course towards the Mediterranean received the appellation of Bosphorus a name not less celebrated  in the history than in the fables of antiquity  The Bosphorus has been very minutely described by Dionysius of Byzantium who lived in the time of Domitian Hudson Geograph Minor tom iii and by Gilles or Gyllius a French traveller of the XVIth century Tournefort Lettre XV seems to have used his own eyes and the learning of Gyllius  A crowd of temples and of votive altars profusely scattered along its steep and woody banks attested the unskilfulness the terrors and the devotion of the Grecian navigators who after the example of the Argonauts explored the dangers of the inhospitable Euxine On these banks tradition long preserved the memory of the palace of Phineus infested by the obscene harpies  There are very few conjectures so happy as that of Le Clerc Bibliotheque Universelle tom i p who supposes that the harpies were only locusts The Syriac or Phaenician name of those insects their noisy flight the stench and devastation which they occasion and the north wind which drives them into the sea all contribute to form this striking resemblance  and of the sylvan reign of Amycus who defied the son of Leda to the combat of the Cestus  The residence of Amycus was in Asia between the old and the new castles at a place called Laurus Insana That of Phineus was in Europe near the village of Mauromole and the Black Sea See Gyllius de Bosph l ii c Tournefort Lettre XV  The streights of the Bosphorus are terminated by the Cyanean rocks which according to the description of the poets had once floated on the face of the waters and were destined by the gods to protect the entrance of the Euxine against the eye of profane curiosity  The deception was occasioned by several pointed rocks alternately covered and abandoned by the waves At present there are two small islands one towards either shore that of Europe is distinguished by the column of Pompey  From the Cyanean rocks to the point and harbour of Byzantium the  winding length of the Bosphorus extends about sixteen miles  The ancients computed one hundred and twenty stadia or fifteen Roman miles They measured only from the new castles but they carried the streights as far as the town of Chalcedon  and its most ordinary breadth may be computed at about one mile and a half The  new  castles of Europe and Asia are constructed on either continent upon the foundations of two celebrated temples of Serapis and of Jupiter Urius The  old  castles a work of the Greek emperors command the narrowest part of the channel in a place where the opposite banks advance within five hundred paces of each other These fortresses were restored and strengthened by Mahomet the Second when he meditated the siege of Constantinople  Ducas Hist c Leunclavius Hist Turcia Musulmanica l xv p Under the Greek empire these castles were used as state prisons under the tremendous name of Lethe or towers of oblivion  but the Turkish conqueror was most probably ignorant that near two thousand years before his reign Darius had chosen the same situation to connect the two continents by a bridge of boats  Darius engraved in Greek and Assyrian letters on two marble columns the names of his subjectnations and the amazing numbers of his land and sea forces The Byzantines afterwards transported these columns into the city and used them for the altars of their tutelar deities Herodotus l iv c  At a small distance from the old castles we discover the little town of Chrysopolis or Scutari which may almost be considered as the Asiatic suburb of Constantinople The Bosphorus as it begins to open into the Propontis passes between Byzantium and Chalcedon The latter of those cities was built by the Greeks  a few years before the former and the blindness of its founders who overlooked the superior advantages of the opposite coast has been stigmatized by a proverbial expression of contempt  Namque artissimo inter Europam Asiamque divortio Byzantium in extremâ Europâ posuere Graeci quibus Pythium Apollinem consulentibus ubi conderent urbem redditum oraculum est quaererent sedem  caecorum  terris adversam Eâ ambage Chalcedonii monstrabantur quòd priores illuc advecti praevisâ locorum utilitate pejora legissent Tacit Annal xii    The harbour of Constantinople which may be  The port  considered as an arm of the Bosphorus obtained in a very remote period the denomination of the  Golden Horn  The curve which it describes might be compared to the horn of a stag or as it should seem with more propriety to that of an ox  Strabo l x p Most of the antlers are now broke off or to speak less figuratively most of the recesses of the harbour are filled up See Gyllius de Bosphoro Thracio l i c  The epithet of  golden  was expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the most distant countries into the secure and capacious port of Constantinople The river Lycus formed by the conflux of two little streams pours into the harbour a perpetual supply of fresh water which serves to cleanse the bottom and to invite the periodical shoals of fish to seek their retreat in that convenient recess As the vicissitudes of tides are scarcely felt in those seas the constant depth of the harbour allows goods to be landed on the quays without the assistance of boats and it has been observed that in many places the largest vessels may rest their prows against the houses  while their sterns are floating in the water  Procopius de Aedificiis l i c His description is confirmed by modern travellers See Thevenot part i l i c Tournefort Lettre XII Niebuhr Voyage d'Arabie p  From the mouth of the Lycus to that of the harbour this arm of the Bosphorus is more than seven miles in length The entrance is about five hundred yards broad and a strong chain could be occasionally drawn across it to guard the port and city from the attack of an hostile navy  See Ducange C P l i part i c and his Observations sur Villehardouin p The chain was drawn from the Acropolis near the modern Kiosk to the tower of Galata and was supported at convenient distances by large wooden piles    Between the Bosphorus and the Hellespont the  The Propontis  shores of Europe and Asia receding on either side inclose the sea of Marmara which was known to the ancients by the denomination of Propontis The navigation from the issue of the Bosphorus to the entrance of the Hellespont is about one hundred and twenty miles Those who steer their westward course through the middle of the Propontis may at once descry the high lands of Thrace and Bithynia and never lose sight of the lofty summit of Mount Olympus covered with eternal snows  Thevenot Voyages au Levant part i l i c contracts the measure to small Greek miles Belon Observations l ii c gives a good description of the Propontis but contents himself with the vague expression of one day and one night's sail When Sandys Travels p talks of furlongs in length as well as breadth we can only suppose some mistake of the press in the text of that judicious traveller  They leave on the lest a deep gulf at the bottom of which Nicomedia was seated the imperial residence of Diocletian and  they pass the small islands of Cyzicus and Proconnesus before they cast anchor at Gallipoli where the sea which separates Asia from Europe is again contracted into a narrow channel  The geographers who with the most skilful  The Hellespont  accuracy have surveyed the form and extent of the Hellespont assign about sixty miles for the winding course and about three miles for the ordinary breadth of those celebrated streights  See an admirable dissertation of M d'Anville upon the Hellespont or Dardanelles in the Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xxviii p Yet even that ingenious geographer is too fond of supposing new and perhaps imaginary  measures  for the purpose of rendering ancient writers as accurate as himself The stadia employed by Herodotus in the description of the Euxine the Bosphorus c l iv c must undoubtedly be all of the same species but it seems impossible to reconcile them either with truth or with each other  But the narrowest part of the channel is sound to the northward of the old Turkish castles between the cities of Cestus and Abydus It was here that the adventurous Leander braved the passage of the flood for the possession of his mistress  The oblique distance between Sestus and Abydus was thirty stadia The improbable tale of Hero and Leander is exposed by M Mahudel but is defended on the authority of poets and medals by M de la Nauze See the Academie des Inscriptions tom vii Hist p Mem p  It was here likewise in a place where the distance between the opposite banks cannot exceed five hundred paces that Xerxes imposed a stupendous bridge of boats for the purpose of transporting into Europe an hundred and seventy myriads of barbarians  See the seventh book of Herodotus who has erected and elegant trophy to his own fame and to that of his country The review appears to have been made with tolerable accuracy but the vanity first of the Persians and afterwards of the Greeks was interested to magnify the armament and the victory I should much doubt whether the  invaders  have ever outnumbered the  men  of any country which they attacked  A sea contracted within such narrow  limits may seem but ill to deserve the singular epithet of  broad  which Homer as well as Orpheus has frequently bestowed on the Hellespont But our ideas of greatness are of a relative nature the traveller and especially the poet who sailed along the Hellespont who pursued the windings of the stream and contemplated the rural scenery which appeared on every side to terminate the prospect insensibly lost the remembrance of the sea and his fancy painted those celebrated streights with all the attributes of a mighty river flowing with a swift current in the midst of a woody and inland country and at length through a wide mouth discharging itself into the Aegean or Archipelago  See Wood's Observations on Homer p I have with pleasure selected this remark from an author who in general seems to have disappointed the expectation of the public as a critic and still more as a traveller He had visited the banks of the Hellespont he had read Strabo he ought to have consulted the Roman itineraries how was it possible for him to confound Ilium and Alexandria Troas Observations p two cities which were sixteen miles distant from each other  Ancient Troy  Demetrius of Scepsis wrote sixty books on thirty lines of Homer's Catalogue The XIIIth Book of Strabo is sufficient for  our  curiosity  seated on an eminence at the foot of Mount Ida overlooked the mouth of the Hellespont which scarcely received an accession of waters from the tribute of those immortal rivulets the Simois and Scamander The Grecian  camp had stretched twelve miles along the shore from the Sigaean to the Rhaetean promontory and the flanks of the army were guarded by the bravest chiefs who fought under the banners of Agamemnon The first of those promontories was occupied by Achilles with his invincible Myrmidons and the dauntless Ajax pitched his tents on the other After Ajax had fallen a sacrifice to his disappointed pride and to the ingratitude of the Greeks his sepulchre was erected on the ground where he had defended the navy against the rage of Jove and of Hector and the citizens of the rising town of Rhaeteum celebrated his memory with divine honours  Strabo l xiii p The disposition of the ships which were drawn upon dry land and the posts of Ajax and Achilles are very clearly described by Homer See Iliad ix  Before Constantine gave a just preference to the situation of Byzantium he had conceived the design of erecting the seat of empire on this celebrated spot from whence the Romans derived their fabulous origin The extensive plain which lies below ancient Troy towards the Rhaetean promontory and the tomb of Ajax was first chosen for his new capital and though the undertaking was soon relinquished the stately remains of unfinished walls and towers attracted the notice of all who sailed through the streights of the Hellespont  Zosim l ii p Sozomen l ii c Theophanes p Nicephorus Callistus l vii p Zonaras tom ii l xiii p Zosimus places the new city between Ilium and Alexandria but this apparent difference may be reconciled by the large extent of its circumference Before the foundation of Constantinople Thessalonica is mentioned by Cedrenus p and Sardica by Zonaras as the intended capital They both suppose with very little probability that the Emperor if he had not been prevented by a prodigy would have repeated the mistake of the  blind  Chalcedonians    We are at present qualified to view the advantageous position of Constantinople which appears to have been formed by Nature for the  Advantages of Constantinople  centre and capital of a great monarchy Situated in the fortyfirst degree of latitude the Imperial city commanded from her seven hills  Pocock's Description of the East vol ii part ii p His plan of the seven hills is clear and accurate That traveller is seldom so satisfactory  the opposite shores of Europe and Asia the climate was healthy and temperate the soil fertile the harbour secure and capacious and the approach on the side of the continent was of small extent and easy defence The Bosphorus and the Hellespont may be considered as the two gates of Constantinople and the prince who possessed those important passages could always shut them against a naval enemy and open them to the fleets of commerce The preservation of the eastern provinces may in some degree be ascribed to the policy of Constantine as the Barbarians of the Euxine who in the preceding age had poured their armaments into the heart of the Mediterranean soon desisted from the exercise of piracy and despaired of forcing this insurmountable barrier When the gates of the Hellespont and Bosphorus were shut the capital still enjoyed within their spacious inclosure every production which could supply the wants or gratify the luxury of its numerous  inhabitants The seacoasts of Thrace and Bithynia which languish under the weight of Turkish oppression still exhibit a rich prospect of vineyards of gardens and of plentiful harvests and the Propontis has ever been renowned for an inexhaustible store of the most exquisite fish that are taken in their stated seasons without skill and almost without labour  See Belon Observations c Among a variety of different species the Pelamides a sort of Thunnies were the most celebrated We may learn from Polybius Strabo and Tacitus that the profits of the fishery constituted the principal revenue of Byzantium  But when the passages of the Streights were thrown open for trade they alternately admitted the natural and artificial riches of the north and south of the Euxine and of the Mediterranean Whatever rude commodities were collected in the forests of Germany and Scythia as far as the sources of the Tanais and the Borysthenes whatsoever was manufactured by the skill of Europe or Asia the corn of Egypt and the gems and spices of the farthest India were brought by the varying winds into the port of Constantinople which for many ages attracted the commerce of the ancient world  See the eloquent description of Busbequius epistol i p Est in Europa habet in conspectu Asiam Aegyptum Africamque à dextrâ quae tametsi contiguae non sunt maris tamen navigandique commoditate veluti junguntur A sinistra vero Pontus est Euxinus c    The prospect of beauty of safety and of  Foundation of the city  wealth united in a single spot was sufficient to justify the choice of Constantine But as some decent mixture of prodigy and fable has in every  age been supposed to reflect a becoming majesty on the origin of great cities  Datur haec venia antiquitati ut miscendo humana divinis primordia urbium augustiora faciat T Liv in proem  the emperor was desirous of ascribing his resolution not so much to the uncertain counsels of human policy as to the infallible and eternal decrees of divine wisdom In one of his laws he has been careful to instruct posterity that in obedience to the commands of God he laid the everlasting foundations of Constantinople  He says in one of his laws pro commoditate Urbis quam aeterno nomine jubente Deo donavimus Cod Theodos l xiii tit v leg  and though he has not condescended to relate in what manner the coelestial inspiration was communicated to his mind the defect of his modest silence has been liberally supplied by the ingenuity of succeeding writers who describe the nocturnal vision which appeared to the fancy of Constantine as he slept within the walls of Byzantium The tutelar genius of the city a venerable matron sinking under the weight of years and infirmities was suddenly transformed into a blooming maid whom his own hands adorned with all the symbols of Imperial greatness  The Greeks Theophanes Cedrenus and the Author of the Alexandrian Chronicle confine themselves to vague and general expressions For a more particular account of the vision we are obliged to have recourse to such Latin writers as William of Malmsbury See Ducange C P l i p  The monarch awoke interpreted the auspicious omen and obeyed without hesitation the will of heaven The day which gave birth to a city or colony was celebrated by the Romans with such ceremonies as had been ordained by a  generous superstition  See Plutarch in Romul tom i p edit Bryan Among other ceremonies a large hole which had been dug for that purpose was filled up with handfuls of earth which each of the settlers brought from the place of his birth and thus adopted his new country  and though Constantine might omit some rites which savoured too strongly of their Pagan origin yet he was anxious to leave a deep impression of hope and respect on the minds of the spectators On foot with a lance in his hand the emperor himself led the solemn procession and directed the line which was traced as the boundary of the destined capital till the growing circumference was observed with astonishment by the assistants who at length ventured to observe that he had already exceeded the most ample measure of a great city  I shall still advance replied Constantine till HE the invisible guide who marches before me thinks proper to stop  Philostorgius l ii c This incident though borrowed from a suspected writer is characteristic and probable    Without presuming to investigate the nature or motives of this extraordinary conductor we shall content ourselves with the more humble task of describing the extent and limits of Constantinople  See in the Memoirs de l'Academie tom xxxv p a dissertation of M d'Anville on the extent of Constantinople He takes the plan inserted in the Imperium Orientale of Banduri as the most complete but by a series of very nice observations he reduces the extravagant proportion of the scale and instead of determines the circumference of the city as consisting of about French  toises    In the actual state of the city the palace and  Extent  gardens of the Seraglio occupy the eastern promontory the first of the seven hills and cover  about one hundred and fifty acres of our own measure The seat of Turkish jealousy and despotism is erected on the foundations of a Grecian republic but it may be supposed that the Byzantins were tempted by the conveniency of the harbour to extend their habitations on that side beyond the modern limits of the Seraglio The new walls of Constantine stretched from the port to the Propontis across the enlarged breadth of the triangle at the distance of fifteen stadia from the ancient fortification and with the city of Byzantium they inclosed five of the seven hills which to the eyes of those who approach Constantinople appear to rise above each other in beautiful order  Codinus Antiquitat Const p He assigns the church of St Antony as the boundary on the side of the harbour It is mentioned in Ducange l iv c but I have tried without success to discover the exact place where it was situated  About a century after the death of the founder the new buildings extending on one side up the harbour and on the other along the Propontis already covered the narrow ridge of the sixth and the broad summit of the seventh hill The necessity of protecting those suburbs from the incessant inroads of the Barbarians engaged the younger Theodosius to surround his capital with an adequate and permanent inclosure of walls  The new wall of Theodosius was constructed in the year In it was thrown down by an earthquake and rebuilt in three months by the diligence of the praefect Cyrus The suburb of the Blachernae was first taken into the city in the reign of Heraclius Ducange Const l i c  From the eastern promontory to the golden gate the extreme length of  Constantinople was about three Roman miles  The measurement is expressed in the Notitia by feet It is reasonable to suppose that these were Greek feet the proportion of which has been ingeniously determined by M d'Anville He compares the feet with the Hashemite cubits which in different writers are assigned for the height of St Sophia Each of these cubits was equal to French inches  the circumference measured between ten and eleven and the surface might be computed as equal to about two thousand English acres It is impossible to justify the vain and credulous exaggerations of modern travellers who have sometimes stretched the limits of Constantinople over the adjacent villages of the European and even of the Asiatic coast  The accurate Thevenot l i c walked in one hour and three quarters round two of the sides of the triangle from the Kiosk of the Seraglio to the seven towers D'Anville examines with care and receives with confidence this decisive testimony which gives a circumference of ten or twelve miles The extravagant computation of Tournefort Lettre XI of thirtyfour or thirty miles without including Scutari is a strange departure from his usual character  But the suburbs of Pera and Galata though situate beyond the harbour may deserve to be considered as a part of the city  The sycae or figtrees formed the thirteenth region and were very much embellished by Justinian It has since borne the names of Pera and Galata The etymology of the former is obvious that of the latter is unknown See Ducange Const l i c and Gyllius de Byzant l iv c  and this addition may perhaps authorise the measure of a Byzantine historian who assigns sixteen Greek about fourteen Roman miles for the circumference of his native city  One hundred and eleven stadia which may be translated into modern Greek miles each of seven stadia or sometimes only French toises See d'Anville Mesures Itineraires p  Such an extent may seem not unworthy of an Imperial residence  Yet Constantinople must yield to Babylon and Thebes  When the ancient texts which describe the size of Babylon and Thebes are settled the exaggerations reduced and the measures ascertained we find that those famous cities filled the great but not incredible circumference of about twentyfive or thirty miles Compare d'Anville Mem de l'Academie tom xxviii p with his Description de l'Egypte p  to ancient Rome to London and even to Paris  If we divide Constantinople and Paris into equal squares of French  toises  the former contains and the latter of those divisions    The master of the Roman world who aspired  Progress of the work  to erect an eternal monument of the glories of his reign could employ in the prosecution of that great work the wealth the labour and all that yet remained of the genius of obedient millions Some estimate may be formed of the expence bestowed with Imperial liberality on the foundation of Constantinople by the allowance of about two millions five hundred thousand pounds for the construction of the walls the porticoes and the aqueducts  Six hundred centenaries or sixty thousand pounds weight of gold This sum is taken from Codinus Antiquit Const p but unless that contemptible author had derived his information from some purer sources he would probably have been unacquainted with so obsolete a mode of reckoning  The forests that overshadowed the shores of the Euxine and the celebrated quarries of white marble in the little island of Proconnesus supplied an inexhaustible stock of materials ready to be conveyed by the convenience of a short watercarriage to the harbour of Byzantium  For the forests of the Black Sea consult Tournefort Lettre XVI for the marble quarries of Proconnesus see Strabo l xiii p The latter had already furnished the materials of the stately buildings of Cyzicus  A multitude of labourers and  artificers urged the conclusion of the work with incessant toil but the impatience of Constantine soon discovered that in the decline of the arts the skill as well as numbers of his architects bore a very unequal proportion to the greatness of his designs The magistrates of the most distant provinces were therefore directed to institute schools to appoint professors and by the hopes of rewards and privileges to engage in the study and practice of architecture a sufficient number of ingenious youths who had received a liberal education  See the Codex Theodos l xiii tit iv leg This law is dated in the year and was addressed to the praefect of Italy whose jurisdiction extended over Africa The commentary of Godefroy on the whole title well deserves to be consulted  The buildings of the new city were executed by such artificers as the reign of Constantine could afford but they were decorated by the hands of the most celebrated masters of the age of Pericles and Alexander To revive the genius of Phidias and Lysippus surpassed indeed the power of a Roman emperor but the immortal productions which they had bequeathed to posterity were exposed without defence to the rapacious vanity of a despot By his commands the cities of Greece and Asia were despoiled of their most valuable ornaments  Constantinopolis dedicatur poene omnium urbium nuditate Hieronym Chron p See Codinus p The author of the Antiquitat Const l iii apud Banduri Imp Orient tom i p enumerates Rome Sicily Antioch Athens and a long list of other cities The provinces of Greece and Asia Minor may be supposed to have yielded the richest booty  The trophies  of memorable wars the objects of religious veneration the most finished statues of the gods and heroes of the sages and poets of ancient times contributed to the splendid triumph of Constantinople and gave occasion to the remark of the historian Cedrenus  Hist Compend p He describes the statue or rather bust of Homer with a degree of taste which plainly indicates that Cedrenus copied the style of a more fortunate age  who observes with some enthusiasm that nothing seemed wanting except the souls of the illustrious men whom those admirable monuments were intended to represent But it is not in the city of Constantine nor in the declining period of an empire when the human mind was depressed by civil and religious slavery that we should seek for the souls of Homer and of Demosthenes  During the siege of Byzantium the conqueror  Edifices  had pitched his tent on the commanding eminence of the second hill To perpetuate the memory of his success he chose the same advantageous position for the principal Forum  Zosim l ii p Chron Alexandrin vel Paschal p Ducange Const l i c Even the last of those writers seems to confound the Forum of Constantine with the Augusteum or court of the palace I am not satisfied whether I have properly distinguished what belongs to the one and the other  which appears to have been of a circular or rather elliptical form The two opposite entrances formed triumphal arches the porticoes which inclosed it on every side were filled with statues and the centre of the Forum was occupied by a lofty column of which a mutilated fragment is now degraded by the appellation of the  burnt pillar  This column was erected on a pedestal of white  marble twenty feet high and was composed of ten pieces of porphyry each of which measured about ten feet in height and about thirtythree in circumference  The most tolerable account of this column is given by Pocock Description of the East vol ii part ii p But it is still in many instances perplexed and unsatisfactory  On the summit of the pillar above one hundred and twenty feet from the ground stood the colossal statue of Apollo It was of bronze had been transported either from Athens or from a town of Phrygia and was supposed to be the work of Phidias The artist had represented the god of day or as it was afterwards interpreted the emperor Constantine himself with a sceptre in his right hand the globe of the world in his left and a crown of rays glittering on his head  Ducange Const l i c p and his Notes ad Alexiad p The statue of Constantine or Apollo was thrown down under the reign of Alexis Comnenus  The Circus or Hippodrome was a stately building about four hundred paces in length and one hundred in breadth  Tournefort Lettre XII computes the Atmeidan at four hundred paces If he means geometrical paces of five feet each it was three hundred  toises  in length about forty more than the great Circus of Rome See d'Anville Mesures Itineraires p  The space between the two  metae  or goals was filled with statues and obelisks and we may still remark a very singular fragment of antiquity the bodies of three serpents twisted into one pillar of brass Their triple heads had once supported the golden tripod which after the defeat of Xerxes was consecrated in the temple of  Delphi by the victorious Greeks  The guardians of the most holy relics would rejoice if they were able to produce such a chain of evidence as may be alleged on this occasion See Banduri ad Antiquitat Const p Gyllius de Byzant l ii c The original consecration of the tripod and pillar in the temple of Delphi may be proved from Herodotus and Pausanias The pagan Zosimus agrees with the three ecclesiastical historians Eusebius Socrates and Sozomen that the sacred ornaments of the temple of Delphi were removed to Constantinople by the order of Constantine and among these the serpentine pillar of the Hippodrome is particularly mentioned All the European travellers who have visited Constantinople from Buondelmonte to Pocock describe it in the same place and almost in the same manner the differences between them are occasioned only by the injuries which it has sustained from the Turks Mahomet the Second broke the underjaw of one of the serpents with a stroke of his battleaxe Thevenot l i c  The beauty of the Hippodrome has been long since defaced by the rude hands of the Turkish conquerors but under the similar appellation of Atmeidan it still serves as a place of exercise for their horses From the throne whence the emperor viewed the Circensian games a winding staircase  The Latin name  Cochlea  was adopted by the Greeks and very frequently occurs in the Byzantine history Ducange Const l ii c p  descended to the palace a magnificent edifice which scarcely yielded to the residence of Rome itself and which together with the dependent courts gardens and porticoes covered a considerable extent of ground upon the banks of the Propontis between the Hippodrome and the church of St Sophia  There are three topographical points which indicate the situation of the palace The staircase which connected it with the Hippodrome or Atmeidan A small artificial port on the Propontis from whence there was an easy ascent by a flight of marble steps to the gardens of the palace The Augusteum was a spacious court one side of which was occupied by the front of the palace and another by the church of St Sophia  We might likewise  celebrate the baths which still retained the name of Zeuxippus after they had been enriched by the munificence of Constantine with lofty columns various marbles and above threescore statues of bronze  Zeuxippus was an epithet of Jupiter and the baths were a part of old Byzantium The difficulty of assigning their true situation has not been felt by Ducange History seems to connect them with St Sophia and the palace but the original plan inserted in Banduri places them on the other side of the city near the harbour For their beauties see Chron Paschal p and Gyllius de Byzant l ii c Christodorus see Antiquitat Const l vii composed inscriptions in verse for each of the statues He was a Theban poet in genius as well as in birth  Baeotum in crasso jurares aere natum  But we should deviate from the design of this history if we attempted minutely to describe the different buildings or quarters of the city It may be sufficient to observe that whatever could adorn the dignity of a great capital or contribute to the benefit or pleasure of its numerous inhabitants was contained within the walls of Constantinople A particular description composed about a century after its foundation enumerates a capitol or school of learning a circus two theatres eight public and one hundred and fiftythree private baths fiftytwo porticoes five granaries eight aqueducts or reservoirs of water four spacious halls for the meetings of the senate or courts of justice fourteen churches fourteen palaces and four thousand three hundred and eightyeight houses which for their size or beauty deserved to be  distinguished from the multitude of plebeian habitations  See the Notitia Rome only reckoned large houses  domus  but the word must have had a more dignified signification No  insulae

founder In the dark ages which succeeded the translation of the empire the remote and the immediate consequences of that memorable event were strangely confounded by the vanity of the Greeks and the credulity of the Latins  Liutprand Legatio ad Imp Nicephorum p The modern Greeks have strangely dissigured the antiquities of Constantinople We might excuse the errors of the Turkish or Arabian writers but it is somewhat astonishing that the Greeks who had access to the authentic materials preserved in their own language should prefer fiction to truth and loose tradition to genuine history In a single page of Codinus we may detect twelve unpardonable mistakes the reconciliation of Severus and Niger the marriage of their son and daughter the siege of Byzantium by the Macedonians the invasion of the Gauls which recalled Severus to Rome the  sixty  years which elapsed from his death to the foundation of Constantinople  c  It was asserted and believed that all the noble families of Rome the senate and the equestrian order with their innumerable attendants had followed their emperor to the banks of the Propontis that a spurious race of strangers and plebeians was left to possess the solitude of the ancient capital and that the lands of Italy long since converted into gardens were at once deprived of cultivation and inhabitants  Montesquieu Grandeur et Decadence des Romains c  In the course of this history such exaggerations will be reduced to their just  value yet since the growth of Constantinople cannot be ascribed to the general increase of mankind and of industry it must be admitted that this artificial colony was raised at the expence of the ancient cities of the empire Many opulent senators of Rome and of the Eastern provinces were probably invited by Constantine to adopt for their country the fortunate spot which he had chosen for his own residence The invitations of a master are scarcely to be distinguished from commands and the liberality of the emperor obtained a ready and cheerful obedience He bestowed on his favourites the palaces which he had built in the several quarters of the city assigned them lands and pensions for the support of their dignity  Themist Orat iii p edit Hardouin Sozomen l ii c Zosim l ii p Anonym Valesian p If we could credit Codinus p Constantine built houses for the senators on the exact model of their Roman palaces and gratified them as well as himself with the pleasure of an agreeable surprise but the whole story is full of fictions and inconsistencies  and alienated the demesnes of Pontus and Asia to grant hereditary estates by the easy tenure of maintaining a house in the capital  The law by which the younger Theodosius in the year abolished this tenure may be found among the Novellae of that emperor at the head of the Theodosian Code tom vi nov M de Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p has evidently mistaken the nature of these estates With a grant from the Imperial demesnes the same condition was accepted as a favour which would justly have been deemed a hardship if it had been imposed upon private property  But these encouragements and obligations soon became superfluous and were gradually abolished Wherever the seat of government is fixed a  considerable part of the public revenue will be expended by the prince himself by his ministers by the officers of justice and by the domestics of the palace The most wealthy of the provincials will be attracted by the powerful motives of interest and duty of amusement and curiosity A third and more numerous class of inhabitants will insensibly be formed of servants of artificers and of merchants who derive their subsistence from their own labour and from the wants or luxury of the superior ranks In less than a century Constantinople disputed with Rome itself the preeminence of riches and numbers New piles of buildings crowded together with too little regard to health or convenience scarcely allowed the intervals of narrow streets for the perpetual throng of men of horses and of carriages The allotted space of ground was insufficient to contain the increasing people and the additional foundations which on either side were advanced into the sea might alone have composed a very considerable city  The passages of Zosimus of Eunapius of Sozomen and of Agathias which relate to the increase of buildings and inhabitants at Constantinople are collected and connected by Gyllius de Byzant l i c Sidonius Apollinaris in Panegyr Anthem p edit Sirmond describes the moles that were pushed forwards into the sea they consisted of the famous Puzzolan sand which hardens in the water    The frequent and regular distributions of wine  Privileges  and oil of corn or bread of money or provisions had almost exempted the poorer citizens of Rome from the necessity of labour The magnificence of the first Caesars was in some measure imitated  by the founder of Constantinople  Sozomen l li c Philostorg l ii c Codin Antiquitat Const p It appears by Socrates l ii c that the daily allowances of the city consisted of eight myriads of  which we may either translate with Valesius by the words modii of corn or consider as expressive of the number of loaves of bread  but his liberality however it might excite the applause of the people has incurred the censure of posterity A nation of legislators and conquerors might assert their claim to the harvests of Africa which had been purchased with their blood and it was artfully contrived by Augustus that in the enjoyment of plenty the Romans should lose the memory of freedom But the prodigality of Constantine could not be excused by any consideration either of public or private interest and the annual tribute of corn imposed upon Egypt for the benefit of his new capital was applied to feed a lazy and insolent populace at the expence of the husbandmen of an industrious province  See Cod Theodos l xiii and xiv and Cod Justinian Edict xii tom ii p edit Genev See the beautiful complaint of Rome in the poem of Claudian de Bell Gildonico ver  Cum subiit par Roma mihi divisaque sumsit  Aequales aurora togas Aegyptia rura  In partem cessere novam  Some other regulations of this emperor are less liable to blame but they are less deserving of notice He divided Constantinople into fourteen regions or quarters  The regions of Constantinople are mentioned in

acknowledged supremacy which was due to her age to her dignity and to the remembrance of her former greatness  Julian Orat i p celebrates Constantinople as not less superior to all other cities than she was inferior to Rome itself His learned commentator Spanheim p justifies this language by several parallel and contemporary instances Zosimus as well as Socrates and Sozomen flourished after the division of the empire between the two sons of Theodosius which established a perfect  equality  between the old and the new capital    As Constantine urged the progress of the work  Dedication A D or  with the impatience of a lover the walls the porticoes and the principal edifices were completed in a few years or according to another account in a few months  Codinus Antiquitat p affirms that the foundations of Constantinople were laid in the year of the world A D on the th of September and that the city was dedicated the th of May A D He connects these dates with several characteristic epochs but they contradict each other the authority of Codinus is of little weight and the space which he assigns must appear insufficient The term of ten years is given us by Julian Orat i p and Spanheim labours to establish the truth of it p by the help of two passages from Themistius Orat iv p and Philostorgius l ii c which form a period from the year to the year Modern critics are divided concerning this point of chronology and their different sentiments are very accurately discussed by Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p  but this extraordinary diligence  should excite the less admiration since many of the buildings were finished in so hasty and imperfect a manner that under the succeeding reign they were preserved with difficulty from impending ruin  Themistius Orat iii p Zosim l ii p Constantine himself in one of his laws Cod Theod l xv tit i betrays his impatience  But while they displayed the vigour and freshness of youth the founder prepared to celebrate the dedication of his city  Cedrenus and Zonaras saithful to the mode of superstition which prevailed in their own times assure us that Constantinople was consecrated to the Virgin Mother of God  The games and largesses which crowned the pomp of this memorable festival may easily be supposed but there is one circumstance of a more singular and permanent nature which ought not entirely to be overlooked As often as the birthday of the city returned the statue of Constantine framed by his order of gilt wood and bearing in its righthand a small image of the genius of the place was erected on a triumphal car The guards carrying white tapers and clothed in their richest apparel accompanied the solemn procession as it moved through the Hippodrome  When it was opposite to the throne of the reigning emperor he rose from his seat and with grateful reverence adored the memory of his predecessor  The earliest and most complete account of this extraordinary ceremony may be found in the Alexandrian Chronicle p Tillemont and the other friends of Constantine who are offended with the air of Paganism which seems unworthy of a Christian prince had a right to consider it as doubtful but they were not authorised to omit the mention of it  At the festival of his dedication an edict engraved on a column of marble bestowed the title of SECOND or NEW ROME on the city of Constantine

secret and internal causes of its rapid decay In the pursuit of any remarkable institution we may be frequently led into the more early or the more recent times of the Roman history but the proper limits of this enquiry will be included within a period of about one hundred and thirty years from the accession of Constantine to the publication of the Theodosian code  The Theodosian code was promulgated A D See the Prolegomena of Godefroy c i p  from which as well as from the  Notitia  of the east and west  Pancirolus in his elaborate Commentary assigns to the Notitia a date almost

the successful invasion of Gaul by the Barbarians A D See Histoire des anciens Peuples de l'Europe tom vii p  we derive the most copious and authentic information of the state of the empire This variety of objects will suspend for some time the course of the narrative but the interruption will be censured only by those readers who are insensible to the importance of laws and manners while they peruse with eager curiosity the transient intrigues of a court or the accidental event of a battle  The manly pride of the Romans content with  Hierarchy of the state  substantial power had left to the vanity of the east the forms and ceremonies of ostentatious  greatness  Scilicet externae superbiae sueto non inerat notitia nostri perhaps  nostrae  apud quos vis Imperii valet inania transmittuntur Tacit Annal xv The gradation from the style of freedom and simplicity to that of form and servitude may be traced in the Epistles of Cicero of Pliny and of Symmachus  But when they lost even the semblance of those virtues which were derived from their ancient freedom the simplicity of Roman manners was insensibly corrupted by the stately affectation of the courts of Asia The distinctions of personal merit and influence so conspicuous in a republic so feeble and obscure under a monarchy were abolished by the despotism of the emperors who substituted in their room a severe subordination of rank and office from the titled slaves who were seated on the steps of the throne to the meanest instruments of arbitrary power This multitude of abject dependents was interested in the support of the actual government from the dread of a revolution which might at once confound their hopes and intercept the reward of their services In this divine hierarchy for such it is frequently styled every rank was marked with the most scrupulous exactness and its dignity was displayed in a variety of trifling and solemn ceremonies which it was a study to learn and a sacrilege to neglect  The emperor Gratian after confirming a law of precedency published by Valentinian the father of his  Divinity  thus continues Siquis igitur indebitum sibi locum usurpaverit nulla se ignoratione defendat sitque plane  sacrilegii  reus qui  divina  praecepta neglexerit Cod Theod l vi tit v leg  The purity of the Latin language was debased by adopting in the intercourse of pride and flattery a profusion  of epithets which Tully would scarcely have understood and which Augustus would have rejected with indignation The principal officers of the empire were saluted even by the sovereign himself with the deceitful titles of your  Sincerity  your  Gravity  your  Excellency  your  Eminence  your  sublime and wonderful Magnitude  your  illustrious and magnificent Highness  Consult the  Notitia Dignitatum  at the end of the Theodosian Code tom vi p  The codicils or patents of their office were curiously emblazoned with such emblems as were best adapted to explain its nature and high dignity the image or portrait of the reigning emperors a triumphal car the book of mandates placed on a table covered with a rich carpet and illuminated by four tapers the allegorical figures of the provinces which they governed or the appellations and standards of the troops whom they commanded Some of these official ensigns were really exhibited in their hall of audience others preceded their pompous march whenever they appeared in public and every circumstance of their demeanour their dress their ornaments and their train was calculated to inspire a deep reverence for the representatives of supreme majesty By a philosophic observer the system of the Roman government might have been mistaken for a splendid theatre filled with players of every character and degree who repeated the language and imitated the passions of their original model  Pancirolus ad Notitiam utriusque Imperii p But his explanations are obscure and he does not sufficiently distinguish the painted emblems from the effective ensigns of office    All the magistrates of sufficient importance to find a place in the general state of the empire were accurately divided into three classes The  Three ranks of honour  Illustrious  The  Spectabiles  or  Respectable  And The  Clarissimi  whom we may translate by the word  Honourable  In the times of Roman simplicity the lastmentioned epithet was used only as a vague expression of deference till it became at length the peculiar and appropriated title of all who were members of the senate  In the Pandects which may be referred to the reigns of the Antonines  Clarissimus  is the ordinary and legal title of a senator  and consequently of all who from that venerable body were selected to govern the provinces The vanity of those who from their rank and office might claim a superior distinction above the rest of the senatorial order was long afterwards indulged with the new appellation of  Respectable  but the title of  Illustrious  was always reserved to some eminent personages who were obeyed or reverenced by the two subordinate classes It was communicated only I To the consuls and patricians II To the praetorian praefects with the praefects of Rome and Constantinople III To the masters general of the cavalry and the infantry and IV To the seven ministers of the palace who exercised their  sacred  functions about the person of the emperor  Pancirol p I have not taken any notice of the two inferior ranks  Perfectissimus  and  Egregius  which were given to many persons who were not raised to the senatorial dignity  Among those illustrious magistrates who were esteemed coordinate with each other the seniority of appointment  gave place to the union of dignities  Cod Theodos l vi tit vi The rules of precedency are ascertained with the most minute accuracy by the emperors and illustrated with equal prolixity by their learned interpreter  By the expedient of honorary codicils the emperors who were fond of multiplying their favours might sometimes gratify the vanity though not the ambition of impatient courtiers  Cod Theod l vi tit xxii    I As long as the Roman consuls were the first  The consuls  magistrates of a free state they derived their right to power from the choice of the people As long as the emperors condescended to disguise the servitude which they imposed the consuls were still elected by the real or apparent suffrage of the senate From the reign of Diocletian even these vestiges of liberty were abolished and the successful candidates who were invested with the annual honours of the consulship affected to deplore the humiliating condition of their predecessors The Scipios and Catos had been reduced to solicit the votes of plebeians to pass through the tedious and expensive forms of a popular election and to expose their dignity to the shame of a public refusal while their own happier fate had reserved them for an age and government in which the rewards of virtue were assigned by the unerring wisdom of a gracious sovereign  Ausonius in Gratiarum Actione basely expatiates on this unworthy topic which is managed by Mamertinus Panegyr Vet xi with somewhat more freedom and ingenuity  In the epistles which the emperor addressed to the two consuls elect it was declared that they were  created by his sole authority  Cum de Consulibus in annum creandis solus mecum volutarem te Consulem et designavi et declaravi et priorem nuncupavi are some of the expressions employed by the emperor Gratian to his praeceptor the poet Ausonius  Their names and

absent from Rome on the first day of January See the Chronologie de Tillemont tom iii iv and v  On the morning of the first of January the consuls assumed the ensigns of their dignity Their dress was a robe of purple embroidered in silk and gold and sometimes ornamented with costly gems  See Claudian in Cons Prob et Olybrii c and in iv Cons Honorii c though in the latter it is not easy to separate the ornaments of the emperor from those of the consul Ausonius received from the liberality of Gratian a  vestis palmata  or robe of state in which the figure of the emperor Constantius was embroidered    On this solemn occasion they were attended by the most eminent officers of the state and army in the habit of senators and the useless fasces armed with the once formidable axes were

after the fashion of ancient times They immediately exercised an act of jurisdiction by the manumission of a slave who was brought before them for that purpose and the ceremony was intended to represent the celebrated action of the elder Brutus the author of liberty and of the consulship when he admitted among his fellowcitizens the faithful Vindex who had revealed the conspiracy of the Tarquins  Auspice mox laeto sonuit clamore tribunal  Te fastos ineunte quater solemnia ludit  Omnia libertas deductum vindice morem  Lex servat famulusque jugo laxatus herili  Ducitur et grato remeat

sanguinary combats of gladiators had already been prohibited  cost four thousand pounds of gold about one hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling and if so heavy an expence surpassed the faculties or the inclination of the magistrates themselves the sum was supplied from the Imperial treasury  Procopius in Hist Arcana c  As soon as the consuls had discharged these customary duties they were at liberty to retire into the shade of private life and to enjoy during the remainder of the year the undisturbed contemplation of their own greatness They no longer presided in the national councils they no longer executed the resolutions of peace or war Their abilities unless they were employed in more effective offices were of little moment and their names served only as the legal date of the year in which they had filled the chair of Marius and of Cicero Yet it was still felt and acknowledged in the last period of Roman servitude that this empty name might be compared and even preferred  to the possession of substantial power The title of consul was still the most splendid object of ambition the noblest reward of virtue and loyalty The emperors themselves who disdained the faint shadow of the republic were conscious that they acquired an additional splendour and majesty as often as they assumed the annual honours of the consular dignity  In Consulatu honos sine labore suscipitur Mamerlin in Panegyr Vet xi This exalted idea of the consulship is borrowed from an Oration iii p pronounced by Julian in the servile court of Constantius See the Abbé de la Bleterie Memoires de l'Academie tom xxiv p who delights to pursue the vestiges of the old constitution and who sometimes finds them in his copious fancy    The proudest and most perfect separation which  The Patricians  can be found in any age or country between the nobles and the people is perhaps that of the Patricians and the Plebeians as it was established in the first age of the Roman republic Wealth and honours the offices of the state and the ceremonies of religion were almost exclusively possessed by the former who preserving the purity of their blood with the most insulting jealousy  Intermarriages between the Patricians and Plebeians were prohibited by the laws of the XII Tables and the uniform operations of human nature may attest that the custom survived the law See in Livy iv the pride of family urged by the consul and the rights of mankind asserted by the tribune Canuleius  held their clients in a condition of specious vassalage But these distinctions so incompatible with the spirit of a free people were removed after a long struggle by the persevering efforts of the Tribunes The most active and successful of the Plebeians accumulated wealth aspired to honours  deserved triumphs contracted alliances and after some generations assumed the pride of ancient nobility  See the animated pictures drawn by Sallust in the Jurgurthine war of the pride of the nobles and even of the virtuous Metellus who was unable to brook the idea that the honour of the consulship should be bestowed on the obscure merit of his lieutenant Marius c Two hundred years before the race of the Metelli themselves were confounded among the Plebeians of Rome and from the etymology of their name of  Caecilius  there is reason to believe that those haughty nobles derived their origin from a sutler  The Patrician families on the other hand whose original number was never recruited till the end of the commonwealth either failed in the ordinary course of nature or were extinguished in so many foreign and domestic wars or through a want of merit or fortune insensibly mingled with the mass of the people  In the year of Rome very few remained not only of the old Patrician families but even of those which had been created by Caesar and Augustus Tacit Annal xi The family of Scaurus a branch of the Patrician Aemilii was degraded so low that his father who exercised the trade of a charcoalmerchant left him only ten slaves and somewhat less than three hundred pounds sterling Valerius Maximus l iv c n Aurel Victor in Scauro The family was saved from oblivion by the merit of the son  Very few remained who could derive their pure and genuine origin from the infancy of the city or even from that of the republic when Caesar and Augustus Claudius and Vespasian created from the body of the senate a competent number of new Patrician families in the hope of perpetuating an order which was still considered as honourable and sacred  Tacit Annal xi Dion Cassius l lii p The virtues of Agricola who was created a Patrician by the emperor Vespasian reflected honour on that ancient order but his ancestors had not any claim beyond an Equestrian nobility  But these artificial supplies  in which the reigning house was always included were rapidly swept away by the rage of tyrants by frequent revolutions by the change of manners and by the intermixture of nations  This failure would have been almost impossible if it were true as Casaubon compels Aurelius Victor to affirm ad Sueton in Caesar c See Hist August p and Casaubon Comment p that Vespasian created at once a thousand Patrician families But this extravagant number is too much even for the whole Senatorial order unless we should include all the Roman knights who were distinguished by the permission of wearing the laticlave  Little more was left when Constantine ascended the throne than a vague and imperfect tradition that the Patricians had once been the first of the Romans To form a body of nobles whose influence may restrain while it secures the authority of the monarch would have been very inconsistent with the character and policy of Constantine but had he seriously entertained such a design it might have exceeded the measure of his power to ratify by an arbitrary edict an institution which must expect the sanction of time and of opinion He revived indeed the title of PATRICIANS but he revived it as a personal not as an hereditary distinction They yielded only to the transient superiority of the annual consuls but they enjoyed the preeminence over all the great officers of state with the most familiar access to the person of the prince This honourable rank was bestowed on them for life and as they were usually favourites and ministers who had grown old in the Imperial court the true  etymology of the word was perverted by ignorance and flattery and the Patricians of Constantine were reverenced as the adopted  Fathers  of the emperor and the republic  Zosimus l ii p and Godefroy ad Cod Theodos l vi tit vi    II The fortunes of the Praetorian praefects  The Praetorian praefects  were essentially different from these of the consuls and patricians The latter saw their ancient greatness evaporate in a vain title The former rising by degrees from the most humble condition were invested with the civil and military administration of the Roman world From the reign of Severus to that of Diocletian the guards and the palace the laws and the finances the armies and the provinces were intrusted to their superintending care and like the Vizirs of the East they held with one hand the seal and with the other the standard of the empire The ambition of the praefects always formidable and sometimes fatal to the masters whom they served was supported by the strength of the Praetorian bands but after those haughty troops had been weakened by Diocletian and finally suppressed by Constantine the praefects who survived their fall were reduced without difficulty to the station of useful and obedient ministers When they were no longer responsible for the safety of the emperor's person they resigned the jurisdiction which they had hitherto claimed and exercised over all the departments of the palace They were deprived by Constantine of all military command as soon as they had ceased to lead into the  field under their immediate orders the flower of the Roman troops and at length by a singular revolution the captains of the guards were transformed into the civil magistrates of the provinces According to the plan of government instituted by Diocletian the four princes had each their Praetorian praefect and after the monarchy was once more united in the person of Constantine he still continued to create the same number of FOUR PRAEFECTS and entrusted to their care the same provinces which they already administered The praefect of the East stretched his ample jurisdiction into the three parts of the globe which were subject to the Romans from the cataracts of the Nile to the banks of the Phasis and from the mountains of Thrace to the frontiers of Persia The important provinces of Pannonia Dacia Macedonia and Greece once acknowledged the authority of the praefect of Illyricum The power of the praefect of Italy was not confined to the country from whence he derived his title it extended over the additional territory of Rhaetia as far as the banks of the Danube over the dependent islands of the Mediterranean and over that part of the continent of Africa which lies between the confines of Cyrene and those of Tingitania The praefect of the Gauls comprehended under that plural denomination the kindred provinces of Britain and Spain and his authority was obeyed from the wall of Antoninus to the fort of Mount Atlas  Zosimus l ii p If we had not fortunately possessed this satisfactory account of the division of the power and provinces of the Praetorian praefects we should frequently have been perplexed amidst the copious details of the Code and the circumstantial minuteness of the Notitia    After the Praetorian praefects had been dismissed from all military command the civil functions which they were ordained to exercise over so many subject nations were adequate to the ambition and abilities of the most consummate ministers To their wisdom was committed the supreme administration of justice and of the finances the two objects which in a state of peace comprehend almost all the respective duties of the sovereign and of the people of the former to protect the citizens who are obedient to the laws of the latter to contribute the share of their property which is required for the expences of the state The coin the highways the posts the granaries the manufactures whatever could interest the public prosperity was moderated by the authority of the Praetorian praefects As the immediate representatives of the Imperial majesty they were empowered to explain to enforce and on some occasions to modify the general edicts by their discretionary proclamations They watched over the conduct of the provincial governors removed the negligent and inflicted punishments on the guilty From all the inferior jurisdictions an appeal in every matter of importance either civil or criminal might be brought before the tribunal of the praefect but  his  sentence was final and absolute and the emperors themselves refused to admit any complaints against the judgment or the integrity of a magistrate  whom they honoured with such unbounded confidence  See a law of Constantine himself A praefectis autem praetorio provocare

opportunities of collecting a rich harvest of fees of presents and of perquisites Though the emperors no longer dreaded the ambition of their praefects they were attentive to counterbalance the power of this great office by the uncertainty and shortness of its duration  For this and the other dignities of the empire it may be sufficient to refer to the ample commentaries of Pancirolus and Godefroy

distinct abridgment of the state of the Roman empire    From their superior importance and dignity  The praefects of Rome and Constantinople  Rome and Constantinople were alone excepted from the jurisdiction of the Praetorian praefects The immense size of the city and the experience of the tardy ineffectual operation of the laws had furnished the policy of Augustus with a specious pretence for introducing a new magistrate who alone could restrain a servile and turbulent populace  by the strong arm of arbitrary power  Tacit Annal vi Euseb in Chron p Dion Cassius in the oration of Maecenas l vii p describes the prerogatives of the praefect of the city as they were established in his own time  Valerius Messalla was appointed the first praefect of Rome that his reputation might countenance so invidious a measure but at the end of a few days that accomplished citizen  The fame of Messalla has been scarcely equal to his merit In the earliest youth he was recommended by Cicero to the friendship of Brutus He followed the standard of the republic till it was broken in the fields of Philippi he then accepted and deserved the favour of the most moderate of the conquerors and uniformly asserted his freedom and dignity in the court of Augustus The triumph of Messalla was justified by the conquest of Aquitain As an orator he disputed the palm of eloquence with Cicero himself Messalla cultivated every muse and was the patron of every man of genius He spent his evenings in philosophic conversation with Horace assumed his place at table between Delia and Tibullus and amused his leisure by encouraging the poetical talents of young Ovid  resigned his office declaring with a spirit worthy of the friend of Brutus that he found himself incapable of exercising a power incompatible with public freedom  Incivilem esse potestatem contestans says the translator of Eusebius Tacitus expresses the same idea in other words quasi+nescius exercendi  As the sense of liberty became less exquisite the advantages of order were more clearly understood and the praefect who seemed to have been designed as a terror only to slaves and vagrants was permitted to extend his civil and criminal jurisdiction over the equestrian and noble families of Rome The praetors annually created as the judges of law and equity could not long dispute the possession of the Forum with a vigorous  and permanent magistrate who was usually admitted into the confidence of the prince Their courts were deserted their number which had once fluctuated between twelve and eighteen  See Lipsius

declared to precede and command all city magistrates sine injuriâ ac detrimento honoris alieni  In the discharge of his laborious employment the governor of Rome was assisted by fifteen officers some of whom had been originally his equals or even his superiors The principal departments were relative to the command of a numerous watch established as a  safeguard against fires robberies and nocturnal disorders the custody and distribution of the public allowance of corn and provisions the care of the port of the aqueducts of the common sewers and of the navigation and bed of the Tyber the inspection of the markets the theatres and of the private as well as public works Their vigilance ensured the three principal objects of a regular police safety plenty and cleanliness and as a proof of the attention of government to preserve the splendour and ornaments of the capital a particular inspector was appointed for the statues the guardian as it were of that inanimate people which according to the extravagant computation of an old writer was scarcely inferior in number to the living inhabitants of Rome About thirty years after the foundation of Constantinople a similar magistrate was created in that rising metropolis for the same uses and with the same powers A perfect equality was established between the dignity of the  two  municipal and that of the  four  praetorian praefects  Besides our usual guides we may observe that Felix Cantelorius has written a separate treatise De Praefecto Urbis and that many curious details concerning the police of Rome and Constantinople are contained in the fourteenth book of the Theodosian Code    Those who in the Imperial hierarchy were  The proconsuls vicepraefects c  distinguished by the title of  Respectable  formed an intermediate class between the  illustrious  praefects and the  honourable  magistrates of the provinces In this class the proconsuls of Asia Achaia and Africa claimed a preeminence which was yielded  to the remembrance of their ancient dignity and the appeal from their tribunal to that of the praefects was almost the only mark of their dependence  Eunapius affirms that the proconsul of Asia was independent of the praefect which must however be understood with some allowance the jurisdiction of the vicepraefect he most assuredly disclaimed Pancirolus p  But the civil government of the empire was distributed into thirteen great DIOCESES each of which equalled the just measure of a powerful kingdom The first of these dioceses was subject to the jurisdiction of the  count  of the east and we may convey some idea of the importance and variety of his functions by observing that six hundred apparitors who would be styled at present either secretaries or clerks or ushers or messengers were employed in his immediate office  The proconsul of Africa had four hundred apparitors and they all received large salaries either from the treasury or the province See Pancirol p and Cod Justinian l xii tit lvi lvii  The place of  Augustal praefect  of Egypt was no longer filled by a Roman knight but the name was retained and the extraordinary powers which the situation of the country and the temper of the inhabitants had once made indispensable were still continued to the governor The eleven remaining dioceses of Asiana Pontica and Thrace of Macedonia Dacia and Pannonia or Western Illyricum of Italy and Africa of Gual Spain and Britain were governed by twelve  vicars  or  vicepraefects  In Italy there was likewise the  Vicar  of  Rome  It has been much disputed whether his jurisdiction measured one hundred miles from the city or whether it stretched over the ten southern provinces of Italy  whose  name sufficiently explains the nature and dependence of their office It may be added that the lieutenantgenerals of the Roman armies the military counts and dukes who will be hereafter mentioned were allowed the rank and title of  Respectable  As the spirit of jealousy and ostentation prevailed  The governors of the provinces  in the councils of the emperors they proceeded with anxious diligence to divide the substance and to multiply the titles of power The vast countries which the Roman conquerors had united under the same simple form of administration were imperceptibly crumbled into minute fragments till at length the whole empire was distributed into one hundred and sixteen provinces each of which supported an expensive and splendid establishment Of these three were governed by  proconsuls  thirtyseven by  consulars  five by  correctors  and seventyone by  presidents  The appellations of these magistrates were different they ranked in successive order the ensigns of their dignity were curiously varied and their situation from accidental circumstances might be more or less agreeable or advantageous But they were all excepting only the proconsuls alike included in the class of  honourable  persons and they were alike entrusted during the pleasure of the prince and under the authority of the praefects or their deputies with the administration of justice and the finances in their respective districts The ponderous volumes of the Codes and  Pandects  Among the works of the celebrated Ulpian there was one in ten books concerning the office of a proconsul whose duties in the most essential articles were the same as those of an ordinary governor of a province  would furnish ample materials for a minute enquiry into the system of provincial government as in the space of six centuries it was improved by the wisdom of the Roman statesmen and lawyers It may be sufficient for the historian to select two singular and salutary provisions intended to restrain the abuse of authority For the preservation of peace and order the governors of the provinces were armed with the sword of justice They inflicted corporal punishments and they exercised in capital offences the power of life and death But they were not authorised to indulge the condemned criminal with the choice of his own execution or to pronounce a sentence of the mildest and most honourable kind of exile These prerogatives were reserved to the praefects who alone could impose the heavy fine of fifty pounds of gold their vicegerents were confined to the trifling weight of a few ounces  The presidents or consulars could impose only two ounces the vicepraefects three the proconsuls count of the east and praefect of Egypt six See Heineccii Jur Civil tom i p Pandect l xlviii tit xix n Cod Justinian l i tit liv leg  This distinction which seems to grant the larger while it denies the smaller degree of authority was founded on a very rational motive The smaller degree was infinitely more liable to abuse The passions of a provincial magistrate might frequently provoke him into acts of oppression  which affected only the freedom or the fortunes of the subject though from a principle of prudence perhaps of humanity he might still be terrified by the guilt of innocent blood It may likewise be considered that exile considerable fines or the choice of an easy death relate more particularly to the rich and the noble and the persons the most exposed to the avarice or resentment of a provincial magistrate were thus removed from his obscure persecution to the more august and impartial tribunal of the Praetorian praefect As it was reasonably apprehended that the integrity of the judge might be biassed if his interest was concerned or his affections were engaged the strictest regulations were established to exclude any person without the special dispensation of the emperor from the government of the province where he was born  Ut nulli patriae suae administratio sine speciali principis permissu permittatur Cod Justinian l i tit xli This law was first enacted by the emperor Marcus after the rebellion of Cassius Dion l lxxi The same regulation is observed in China with equal strictness and with equal effect  and to prohibit the governor or his son from contracting marriage with a native or an inhabitant  Pandect l xxiii tit ii n  or from purchasing slaves lands or houses within the extent of his jurisdiction  In jure

Constantine to Justin From this prohibition which is extended to the meanest officers of the governor they except only clothes and provisions The purchase within five years may be recovered after

administration of justice and expresses the warmest indignation that the audience of the judge his dispatch of business his seasonable delays and his final sentence were publicly sold either by himself or by the officers of his court The continuance and perhaps the impunity of these crimes is attested by the repetition of impotent laws and inneffectual menaces  Cessent rapaces jam nunc

which flourished above three centuries from the time of Alexander Severus the author perhaps of an institution so advantageous to his native country After a regular course of education which lasted five years the students dispersed themselves through the provinces in search of fortune and honours nor could they want an inexhaustible supply of business in a great empire already corrupted by the multiplicity of laws of arts and of vices The court of the Praetorian praefect of the east could alone furnish employment for one hundred and fifty advocates sixtyfour of whom were distinguished by peculiar privileges and two were annually chosen with a salary of sixty pounds of gold to defend the causes of the treasury The first experiment was made of their judicial talents by appointing them to act occasionally as assessors to the magistrates from thence they were often raised to preside in the tribunals before which they had pleaded They obtained the government of a province and by the aid of merit of reputation or of favour they ascended by successive steps to the  illustrious  dignities of the state  As in a former period I have traced the civil and military promotion of Pertinax I shall here insert the civil honours of Mallius Theodorus He was distinguished by his eloquence while he pleaded as an advocate in the court of the Praetorian praefect He governed one of the provinces of Africa either as president or consular and deserved by his administration the honour of a brass statue He was appointed vicar or vicepraefect of Macedonia Quaestor Count of the sacred largesses Praetorian praefect of the Gauls whilst he might yet be represented as a young man After a retreat perhaps a disgrace of many years which Mallius confounded by some critics with the poet Manilius see Fabricius Bibliothec Latin Edit Ernest tom i c p employed in the study of the Grecian philosophy he was named Praetorian praefect of Italy in the year While he still exercised that great office he was created in the year consul for the West and his name on account of the infamy of his colleague the eunuch Eutropius often stands alone in the Fasti In the year Mallius was appointed a second time Praetorian praefect of Italy Even in the venal panegyric of Claudian we may discover the merit of Mallius Theodorus who by a rare felicity was the intimate friend both of Symmachus and of St Augustin See Tillemont Hist des Emp tom v p  In the practice  of the bar these men had considered reason as the instrument of dispute they interpreted the laws according to the dictates of private interest and the same pernicious habits might still adhere to their characters in the public administration of the state The honour of a liberal profession has indeed been vindicated by ancient and modern advocates who have filled the most important stations with pure integrity and consummate wisdom but in the decline of Roman jurisprudence the ordinary promotion of lawyers was pregnant with mischief and disgrace The noble art which had once been preserved as the sacred inheritance of the patricians was fallen into the hands of freedmen and plebeians  Mamertinus in Panegyr vet xi Austerius apud Photium p  who with cunning rather than with skill exercised a sordid and pernicious trade Some of them procured admittance into families for the purpose of fomenting differences of encouraging suits and of preparing a harvest of gain for themselves or their bretheren  Others recluse in their chambers maintained the dignity of legal professors by furnishing a rich client with subtleties to confound the plainest truth and with arguments to colour the most unjustifiable pretensions The splendid and popular class was composed of the advocates who filled the Forum with the sound of their turgid and loquacious rhetoric Careless of fame and of justice they are described for the most part as ignorant and rapacious guides who conducted their clients through a maze of expence of delay and of disappointment from whence after a tedious series of years they were at length dismissed when their patience and fortune were almost exhausted  The curious passage of Ammianus l xxx c in which he paints the manners of contemporary lawyers affords a strange mixture of sound sense false rhetoric and extravagant satire Godefroy Prolegom ad Cod Theod c i p supports the historian by similar complaints and authentic facts In the fourth century many camels might have been laden with lawbooks Eunapius in Vet Edesii p    III In the system of policy introduced by Augustus  The military officers  the governors those at least of the imperial provinces were invested with the full powers of the sovereign himself Ministers of peace and war the distribution of rewards and punishments depended on them alone and they successively appeared on their tribunal in the robes of civil magistracy and in complete armour at the head of the Roman legions  See a very splendid example in the Life of Agricola particularly c The lieutenant of Britain was entrusted with the same powers which Cicero proconsul of Cilicia had exercised in the name of the senate and people  The influence of the  revenue the authority of law and the command of a military force concurred to render their power supreme and absolute and whenever they were tempted to violate their allegiance the loyal province which they involved in their rebellion was scarcely sensible of any change in its political state From the time of Commodus to the reign of Constantine near one hundred governors might be enumerated who with various success erected the standard of revolt and though the innocent were too often sacrificed the guilty might be sometimes prevented by the suspicious cruelty of their master  The Abbé Dubos who has examined with accuracy see Hist de la Monarchie Françoise tom i p edit the institutions of Augustus and of Constantine observes that if Otho had been put to death the day before he executed his conspiracy Otho would now appear in history as innocent as Corbulo  To secure his throne and the public tranquillity from these formidable servants Constantine resolved to divide the military from the civil administration and to establish as a permanent and professional distinction a practice which had been adopted only as an occasional expedient The supreme jurisdiction exercised by the Praetorian praefects over the armies of the empire was transferred to the two  masters general  whom he instituted the one for the  cavalry  the other for the  infantry  and though each of these  illustrious  officers was more peculiarly responsible for the discipline of those troops which were under his immediate inspection they both indifferently commanded in the field the several bodies whether of horse or foot which were united in the  same army  Zosimus l ii p Before the end of the reign of Constantius the  magistri militum  were already increased to four See Valesius ad Ammian l xvi c  Their number was soon doubled by the division of the east and west and as separate generals of the same rank and title were appointed on the four important frontiers of the Rhine of the Upper and the Lower Danube and of the Euphrates the defence of the Roman empire was at length committed to eight masters general of the cavalry and infantry Under their orders thirtyfive military commanders were stationed in the provinces three in Britain six in Gaul one in Spain one in Italy five on the Upper and four on the Lower Danube in Asia eight three in Egypt and four in Africa The titles of  counts  and  dukes  Though the military counts and dukes are frequently mentioned both in history and the codes we must have recourse to the Notitia for the exact knowledge of their number and stations For the institution rank privileges c of the counts in general see Cod Theod l vi tit xiixx with the Commentary of Godefroy  by which they were properly distinguished have obtained in modern languages so very different a sense that the use of them may occasion some surprise But it should be recollected that the second of those appellations is only a corruption of the Latin word which was indiscriminately applied to any military chief All these provincial generals were therefore  dukes  but no more than ten among them were dignified with the rank of  counts  or companions a title of honour or rather of favour which had been recently invented in the  court of Constantine A gold belt was the ensign which distinguished the office of the counts and dukes and besides their pay they received a liberal allowance sufficient to maintain one hundred and ninety servants and one hundred and fiftyeight horses They were strictly prohibited from interfering in any matter which related to the administration of justice or the revenue but the command which they exercised over the troops of their department was independent of the authority of the magistrates About the same time that Constantine gave a legal sanction to the ecclesiastical order he instituted in the Roman empire the nice balance of the civil and the military powers The emulation and sometimes the discord which reigned between two professions of opposite interests and incompatible manners was productive of beneficial and of pernicious consequences It was seldom to be expected that the general and the civil governor of a province should either conspire for the disturbance or should unite for the service of their country While the one delayed to offer the assistance which the other disdained to solicit the troops very frequently remained without orders or without supplies the public safety was betrayed and the defenceless subjects were left exposed to the fury of the Barbarians The divided administration which had been formed by Constantine relaxed the vigour of the state while it secured the tranquillity of the monarch  The memory of Constantine has been deservedly  Distinction of the troops  censured for another innovation which corrupted  military discipline and prepared the ruin of the empire The nineteen years which preceded his final victory over Licinius had been a period of license and intestine war The rivals who contended for the possession of the Roman world had withdrawn the greatest part of their forces from the guard of the general frontier and the principal cities which formed the boundary of their respective dominions were filled with soldiers who considered their countrymen as their most implacable enemies After the use of these internal garrisons had ceased with the civil war the conqueror wanted either wisdom or firmness to revive the severe discipline of Diocletian and to suppress a fatal indulgence which habit had endeared and almost confirmed to the military order From the reign of Constantine a popular and even legal distinction was admitted between the  Palatines  Zosimus l ii p The distinction between the two classes of Roman troops is very darkly expressed in the historians the laws and the Notitia Consult however the copious  paratitlon  or abstract which Godefroy has drawn up of the seventh book de

the superiority of their pay and privileges were permitted except in the extraordinary emergencies of war to occupy their tranquil stations in the heart of the provinces The most flourishing cities were oppressed by the intolerable weight of quarters The soldiers insensibly forgot the virtues of their profession and contracted only the  vices of civil life They were either degraded by the industry of mechanic trades or enervated by the luxury of baths and theatres They soon became careless of their martial exercises curious in their diet and apparel and while they inspired terror to the subjects of the empire they trembled at the hostile approach of the Barbarians  Ferox erat in suos miles et rapax ignavus vero in hostes et fractus Ammian l xxii c He observes that they loved downy beds and houses of marble and that their cups were heavier than their swords  The chain of fortifications which Diocletian and his colleagues had extended along the banks of the great rivers was no longer maintained with the same care or defended with the same vigilance The numbers which still remained under the name of the troops of the frontier might be sufficient for the ordinary defence But their spirit was degraded by the humiliating reflection that  they  who were exposed to the hardships and dangers of a perpetual warfare were rewarded only with about twothirds of the pay and emoluments which were lavished on the troops of the court Even the bands or legions that were raised the nearest to the level of those unworthy favourites were in some measure disgraced by the title of honour which they were allowed to assume It was in vain that Constantine repeated the most dreadful menaces of fire and sword against the Borderers who should dare to desert their colours to connive at the inroads of the Barbarians or to  participate in the spoil  Cod Theod l vii tit i leg tit xii leg See Howell's Hist of the World vol ii p That learned historian who is not sufficiently known labours to justify the character and policy of Constantine  The mischiefs which flow from injudicious counsels are seldom removed by the application of partial severities and though succeeding princes laboured to restore the strength and numbers of the frontier garrisons the empire till the last moment of its dissolution continued to languish under the mortal wound which had been so rashly or so weakly inflicted by the hand of Constantine  The same timid policy of dividing whatever is  Reduction of the legions  united of reducing whatever is eminent of dreading every active power and of expecting that the most feeble will prove the most obedient seems to pervade the institutions of several princes and particularly those of Constantine The martial pride of the legions whose victorious camps had so often been the scene of rebellion was nourished by the memory of their past exploits and the consciousness of their actual strength As long as they maintained their ancient establishment of six thousand men they subsisted under the reign of Diocletian each of them singly a visible and important object in the military history of the Roman empire A few years afterwards these gigantic bodies were shrunk to a very diminutive size and when  seven  legions with some auxiliaries defended the city of Amida against the Persians the total garrison with the  inhabitants of both sexes and the peasants of the deserted country did not exceed the number of twenty thousand persons  Ammian l xix c He observes c that the desperate sallies of two Gallic legions were like an handful of water thrown on a great conflagration  From this fact and from similar examples there is reason to believe that the constitution of the legionary troops to which they partly owed their valour and discipline was dissolved by Constantine and that the bands of Roman infantry which still assumed the same names and the same honours consisted only of one thousand thousand or fifteen hundred men  Pancirolus ad Notitiam p Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xxv p  The conspiracy of so many separate detachments each of which was awed by the sense of its own weakness could easily be checked and the successors of Constantine might indulge their love of ostentation by issuing their orders to one hundred and thirtytwo legions inscribed on the musterroll of their numerous armies The remainder of their troops was distributed into several hundred cohorts of insantry and squadrons of cavalry Their arms and titles and ensigns were calculated to inspire terror and to display the variety of nations who marched under the imperial standard And not a vestige was left of that severe simplicity which in the ages of freedom and victory had distinguished the line of battle of a Roman army from the confused host of an Asiatic monarch  Romana acies unius prope formae erat et hominum et armorum genereRegia acies varia magis multis gentibus dissimilitudine armorum auxiliorumque erat T Liv l xxxvii c Flaminius even before the event had compared the army of Antiochus to a supper in which the flesh of one vile animal was diversified by the skill of the cooks See the life of Flaminius in Plutarch  A more particular enumeration  drawn from the  Notitia  might exercise the diligence of an antiquary but the historian will content himself with observing that the number of permanent stations or garrisons established on the frontiers of the empire amounted to five hundred and eightythree and that under the successors of Constantine the complete force of the military establishment was computed at six hundred and fortyfive thousand soldiers  Agathias l v p edit Louvre  An effort so prodigious surpassed the wants of a more antient and the faculties of a later period  In the various states of

subjects or at least the nobles of a monarchy are animated by a sentiment of honour but the timid and luxurious inhabitants of a declining empire must be allured into the service by the hopes of profit or compelled by the dread of punishment The resources of the Roman treasury were exhausted by the encrease of pay by the repetition of donatives and by the invention of new emoluments and indulgences which in the opinion of the provincial youth might compensate the hardships and dangers of a military life Yet although the stature was lowered  Valentinian Cod Theodos l vii tit xiii leg

difficulty of procuring a regular and adequate supply of volunteers obliged the emperors to adopt more effectual and coercive methods The lands bestowed on the veterans as the free reward of their valour were henceforwards granted under a condition which contains the first rudiments of the feudal tenures that their sons who succeeded to the inheritance should devote themselves to the profession of arms as soon as they attained the age of manhood and their cowardly refusal was punished by the loss of honour of fortune or even of life  See the two titles De Veteranis and De Filiis Veteranorum in the seventh book of the Theodosian Code The age at which their military service was required varied from twentyfive to sixteen If the sons of the veterans appeared with a horse they had a right to serve in the cavalry two horses gave them some valuable privileges  But as the annual growth of the sons of the veterans bore a very small proportion to the demands of the service levies of men were frequently required from the provinces and every proprietor was obliged either to take up arms or to procure a substitute or to purchase his exemption by the payment of a heavy fine The sum of fortytwo pieces of gold to which it was  reduced  ascertains the exorbitant price of volunteers and the reluctance  with which the government admitted of this alternative  Cod Theod l vii tit xiii leg According to the historian Socrates see Godefroy ad loc the same emperor Valens sometimes required eighty pieces of gold for a recruit In the following law it is faintly expressed that slaves shall

and the provinces chose to cut off the fingers of their right hand to escape from being pressed into the service and this strange expedient was so commonly practised as to deserve the severe

profitable to defend than to ravage the provinces were enrolled not only in the auxiliaries of their respective nations but in the legions themselves and among the most distinguished of the Palatine troops As they freely mingled with the subjects of the empire they gradually learned to despise their manners and to imitate their arts They abjured the implicit reverence which the pride of Rome had exacted from their ignorance while they acquired the knowledge and possession of those advantages by which alone she supported her declining greatness The Barbarian soldiers who displayed any military talents were advanced without exception to the most important commands and the names of the tribunes of the counts and dukes and of the generals themselves betray a foreign origin which they no longer condescended to disguise They were often entrusted with the conduct of a war against their countrymen and though most of them preferred the ties of allegiance to those of blood they did not always avoid the guilt or at least the suspicion of holding a treasonable correspondence with the enemy of inviting his invasion or of sparing his retreat The camps and the palace of the son of Constantine were governed by the powerful faction of the Franks who preserved the strictest connection with each other and with their country and who resented every personal affront as a national indignity

invest a very extraordinary candidate with the consular robes the sacrilegious profanation would have scarcely excited less astonishment if instead of a horse the noblest chieftain of Germany or Britain had been the object of his choice The revolution of three centuries had produced so remarkable a change in the prejudices of the people that with the public approbation Constantine shewed his successors the example of bestowing the honours of the consulship on the barbarians who by their merit and services had deserved to be ranked among the first of the Romans  Barbaros omnium primus ad usque fasces auxerat et trabeas consulares Ammian l xx c Eusebius in Vit Constantin l iv c and Aurelius Victor seem to confirm the truth of this assertion yet in the thirtytwo consular Fasti of the reign of Constantine I cannot discover the name of a single Barbarian I should therefore interpret the liberality of that prince as relative to the ornaments rather than to the office of the consulship  But as these hardy veterans who had been educated in the ignorance or contempt of the laws were incapable of exercising any civil offices the powers of the human mind were contracted by the irreconcileable separation of talents as well as of professions The accomplished citizens of the Greek and Roman republics whose characters could adapt themselves to the bar the senate the camp or the schools had learned to write to speak and to act with the same spirit and with equal abilities  IV Besides the magistrates and generals who  Seven ministers of the palace  at a distance from the court diffused their delegated  authority over the provinces and armies the emperor conferred the rank of  Illustrious  on seven of his more immediate servants to whose fidelity he entrusted his safety or his counsels or his treasures The private apartments of the palace were governed by a favourite eunuch who in the language of that age was styled the  praepositus  The chamberlain  or praefect of the sacred bedchamber His duty was to attend the emperor in his hours of state or in those of amusement and to perform about his person all those menial services which can only derive their splendor from the influence of royalty Under a prince who deserved to reign the great chamberlain for such we may call him was an useful and humble domestic but an artful domestic who improves every occasion of unguarded confidence will insensibly acquire over a feeble mind that ascendant which harsh wisdom and uncomplying virtue can seldom obtain The degenerate grandsons of Theodosius who were invisible to their subjects and contemptible to their enemies exalted the praefects of their bedchamber above the heads of all the ministers of the palace  Cod Theod l vi tit  and even his deputy

borrowed from the military character of the first emperors the steward of their household was styled the count of their camp comes castrensis Cassiodorius very seriously represents to him that his own fame and that of the empire must depend on the opinion which foreign ambassadors may conceive of the plenty and magnisicence of the royal table Variar l vi epistol  The principal administration of public affairs was committed to the diligence and abilities of the  master of the offices  Gutherius de Officiis Domûs Augustae l ii c l iii has very accurately explained the functions of the master of the offices and the constitution of his subordinate  scrinia  But he vainly attempts on the most doubtful authority to deduce from the time of the Antonines or even of Nero the origin of a magistrate who cannot be found in history before the reign of Constantine    The master of the offices  He was the supreme magistrate of the palace inspected the discipline of the civil and military  schools  and received appeals from all parts of the empire in the causes which related to that numerous army of privileged persons who as the servants of the court had obtained for themselves and families a right to decline the authority of the ordinary judges The correspondence between the prince and his subjects was managed by the four  scrinia  or offices of this minister of state The first was appropriated to memorials the second to epistles the third to petitions and the fourth to papers and orders of a miscellaneous kind Each of these was directed by an inferior  master  of  respectable  dignity and the whole business was dispatched by an hundred and fortyeight secretaries chosen for the most part from the profession of the law on account of the variety of abstracts of reports and references which frequently  occurred in the exercise of their several functions From a condescension which in former ages would have been esteemed unworthy of the Roman majesty a particular secretary was allowed for the Greek language and interpreters were appointed to receive the ambassadors of the Barbarians but the department of foreign affairs which constitutes so essential a part of modern policy seldom diverted the attention of the master of the offices His mind was more seriously engaged by the general direction of the posts and arsenals of the empire There were thirtyfour cities fifteen in the east and nineteen in the west in which regular companies of workmen were perpetually employed in fabricating defensive armour offensive weapons of all sorts and military engines which were deposited in the arsenals and occasionally delivered for the service of the troops In the course of nine centuries the office of  The quaestor  quaestor  had experienced a very singular revolution In the infancy of Rome two inferior magistrates were annually elected by the people to relieve the consuls from the invidious management of the public treasure  Tacitus Annal xi says that the first quaestors were elected by the people sixtyfour years after the foundation of the republic but he is of opinion that they had long before that period been annually appointed by the consuls and even by the kings But this obscure point of antiquity is contested by other writers  a similar assistant was granted to every proconsul and to every praetor who exercised a military or provincial command with the extent of conquest the two quaestors were gradually multiplied to the number of four  of eight of twenty and for a short time perhaps of forty  Tacitus Annal xi seems to consider twenty as the highest number of quaestors and Dion l xliii p insinuates that if the dictator Caesar once created forty it was only to facilitate the payment of an immense debt of gratitude Yet the augmentation which he made of praetors subsisted under the succeeding reigns  and the noblest citizens ambitiously solicited an office which gave them a seat in the senate and a just hope of obtaining the honours of the republic Whilst Augustus affected to maintain the freedom of election he consented to accept the annual privilege of recommending or rather indeed of nominating a certain proportion of candidates and it was his custom to select one of these distinguished youths to read his orations or epistles in the assemblies of the senate  Sueton in August c and Torrent ad loc Dion Cas p  The practice of Augustus was imitated by succeeding princes the occasional commission was established as a permanent office and the favoured quaestor assuming a new and more illustrious character alone survived the suppression of his ancient and useless colleagues  The youth and inexperience of the quaestors who entered on that important office in their twentyfifth year Lips Excurs

was abolished and in the subsequent troubles the annual or triennial elections of quaestors must have naturally ceased  As the orations  which he composed in the name of the emperor  Cum patris nomine

considered as the representative of the legislative power the oracle of the council and the original source of the civil jurisprudence He was sometimes invited to take his seat in the supreme judicature of the Imperial consistory with the Praetorian praefects and the master of the offices and he was frequently requested to resolve the doubts of inferior judges but as he was not oppressed with a variety of subordinate business his leisure and talents were employed to cultivate that dignified style of eloquence which in the corruption of taste and language still preserves the majesty of

and daily expence of the civil and military administration in every part of a great empire would exceed the powers of the most vigorous imagination The actual account employed several hundred persons distributed into eleven different offices which were artfully contrived to examine and controul their respective operations The multitude of these agents had a natural tendency to encrease and it was more than once thought expedient to dismiss to their native homes the useless supernumeraries who deserting their honest labours had pressed with too much eagerness into the lucrative profession of the finances  Cod Theod l vi tit Cod Justinian l xii tit  Twentynine provincial receivers of whom eighteen were honoured with the title of count corresponded with the treasurer and he extended his jurisdiction over the mines from whence the precious metals were extracted over the mints in which they were converted into the current coin and over the public treasuries of the most important cities

successive operations of spinning weaving and dying were executed chiefly by women of a servile condition for the use of the palace and army Twentysix of these institutions are enumerated in the west

intolerable abuse Two or three hundred  agents  or messengers were employed under the jurisdiction of the master of the offices to announce the names of the annual consuls and the edicts or victories

admitted rather than approved in the jurisprudence of the Romans They applied this sanguinary mode of examination only to servile bodies whose sufferings were seldom weighed by those haughty republicans in the scale of justice or humanity but they would never consent to violate the sacred person of a citizen till they possessed the clearest evidence of his guilt  The Pandects l xlviii tit

periculosa et quae veritatem fallat  The annals of tyranny from the reign of Tiberius to that of Domitian circumstantially relate the executions of many innocent victims but as long as the faintest remembrance was kept alive  of the national freedom and honour the last hours of a Roman were secure from the danger of ignominious torture  In the conspiracy of Piso against Nero Epicharis libertina

provincial magistrates was not however regulated by the practice of the city or the strict maxims of the civilians They found the use of torture established not only among the slaves of oriental despotism but among the Macedonians who obeyed a limited monarch among the Rhodians who flourished by the liberty of commerce and even among the sage Athenians who had asserted and adorned the dignity of human kind  Dicendum de Institutis Atheniensium Rhodiorum doctissimorum hominum apud quos etiam id quod acerbissimum est liberi civesque torquentur Cicero Partit Orat c We may learn from the trial

employing the rack to extort from vagrants or plebeian criminals the confession of their guilt till they insensibly proceeded to confound the distinctions of rank and to disregard the privileges of Roman citizens The apprehensions of the subjects urged them to solicit and the interest of the sovereign engaged him to grant a variety of special exemptions which tacitly allowed and even authorised the general use of torture They protected all persons of illustrious or honourable rank bishops  and their presbyters professors of the liberal arts soldiers and their families municipal officers and

consideration of justice or humanity the dignity of age and the tenderness of youth were alike exposed to the most cruel tortures and the terrors of a malicious information which might select them as the accomplices or even as the witnesses perhaps of an imaginary crime perpetually hung over the heads of the principal citizens of the Roman world  Arcadius Charisius is the oldest lawyer quoted in the Pandects to justify the universal practice of torture in all cases of treason but this maxim of tyranny which is admitted by Ammianus l xix c with the most respectful terror is enforced by several laws of the successors of Constantine See Cod Theod l ix tit xxxv In majestatis crimine omnibus aequa est conditio    These evils however terrible they may appear  Finances  were confined to the smaller number of Roman  subjects whose dangerous situation was in some degree compensated by the enjoyment of those advantages either of nature or of fortune which exposed them to the jealousy of the monarch The obscure millions of a great empire have much less to dread from the cruelty than from the avarice of their masters and  their  humble happiness is principally affected by the grievance of excessive taxes which gently pressing on the wealthy descend with accelerated weight on the meaner and more indigent classes of society An ingenious philosopher  Montesquieu Esprit des Loix l xii c  has calculated the universal measure of the public impositions by the degrees of freedom and servitude and ventures to assert that according to an invariable law of nature it must always increase with the former and diminish in a just proportion to the latter But this reflection which would tend to alleviate the miseries of despotism is contradicted at least by the history of the Roman empire which accuses the same princes of despoiling the senate of its authority and the provinces of their wealth Without abolishing all the various customs and duties on merchandizes which are imperceptibly discharged by the apparent choice of the purchaser the policy of Constantine and his successors preferred a simple and direct mode of taxation more congenial to the spirit of an arbitrary government  Mr Hume Essays vol i p has seen this important truth with some degree of perplexity    The name and use of the  indictions  The cycle of indictions which may be traced as high as the reign of

circumstantial regulations on the important subject of tributes but they suppose a clearer knowledge of fundamental principles than it is at present in our power to attain  The emperor subscribed with his own hand and in purple ink the solemn edict or indiction which was fixed up in the principal city of each diocese during two months previous to the first day of September And by a very easy connection of ideas the word  indiction  was transferred to the measure of tribute which it prescribed and to the annual term which it allowed for the payment This general estimate of the supplies was proportioned to the real and imaginary wants of the state but as often as the expence exceeded the revenue or the revenue fell short of the computation an additional tax under the name of  superindiction  was imposed on the people and the most valuable attribute of sovereignty was communicated to the Praetorian praefects who on some occasions were permitted to provide for the unforeseen and extraordinary exigencies of the public service The execution of these laws which it would be tedious to pursue in  their minute and intricate detail consisted of two distinct operations the resolving the general imposition into its constituent parts which were assessed on the provinces the cities and the individuals of the Roman world and the collecting the separate contributions of the individuals the cities and the provinces till the accumulated sums were poured into the Imperial treasuries But as the account between the monarch and the subject was perpetually open and as the renewal of the demand anticipated the perfect discharge of the preceding obligation the weighty machine of the finances was moved by the same hands round the circle of its yearly revolution Whatever was honourable or important in the administration of the revenue was committed to the wisdom of the praefects and their provincial representatives the lucrative functions were claimed by a crowd of subordinate officers some of whom depended on the treasurer others on the governor of the province and who in the inevitable conflicts of a perplexed jurisdiction had frequent opportunities of disputing with each other the spoils of the people The laborious offices which could be productive only of envy and reproach of expence and danger were imposed on the  Decurions  who formed the corporations of the cities and whom the severity of the Imperial laws had condemned to sustain the burthens of civil society  The title concerning the Decurions l xii tit i is the most ample in the whole Theodosian Code since it contains not less than one hundred and ninetytwo distinct laws to ascertain the duties and privileges of that useful order of citizens  The  whole landed property of the empire without excepting the patrimonial estates of the monarch was the object of ordinary taxation and every new purchaser contracted the obligations of the former proprietor An accurate  census

ascertaining the proportion which every citizen should be obliged to contribute for the public service and from the wellknown period of the indictions there is reason to believe that this difficult and expensive operation was repeated at the regular distance of fifteen years The lands were measured by surveyors who were sent into the provinces their nature whether arable or pasture or vineyards or woods was distinctly reported and an estimate was made of their common value from the average produce of five years The numbers of slaves and of cattle constituted an essential part of the report an oath was administered to the proprietors which bound them to disclose the true state of their affairs and their attempts to prevaricate or elude the intention of the legislator were severely watched and punished as a capital crime which included the double guilt of treason and sacrilege  Siquis sacrilegâ vitem falce succiderit aut feracium Ramorum foetus hebetaverit quo declinet fidem Censuum et mentiatur callide paupertatis ingenium mox detectus capitale subibit exitium et bona ejus in Fisci jura migrabunt Cod Theod l xiii tit xi leg Although this law is not without its studied obscurity it is however clear enough to prove the minuteness of the inquisition and the disproportion of the penalty  A large portion of the tribute  was paid in money and of the current coin of the empire gold alone could be legally accepted  The astonishment of Pliny would have ceased Equidem miror P R victis gentibus argentum semper imperitasse non aurum Hist Natur xxxiii  The remainder of the taxes according to the proportions determined by the annual indiction was furnished in a manner still more direct and still more oppressive According to the different nature of lands their real produce in the various articles of wine or oil corn or barley wood or iron was transported by the labour or at the expence of the provincials to the Imperial magazines from whence they were occasionally distributed for the use of the court of the army and of the two capitals Rome and Constantinople The commissioners of the revenue were so frequently obliged to make considerable purchases that they were strictly prohibited from allowing any compensation or from receiving in money the value of those supplies which were exacted in kind In the primitive simplicity of small communities this method may be well adapted to collect the almost voluntary offerings of the people but it is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude and of the utmost strictness which in a corrupt and absolute monarchy must introduce a perpetual contest between the power of oppression and the arts of fraud  Some precautions were taken see Cod Theod l xi tit ii and Cod Justinian l x tit xxvii leg to restrain the magistrates from the abuse of their authority either in the exaction or in the purchase of corn but those who had learning enough to read the orations of Cicero against Verres iii de Frumento might instruct themselves in all the various arts of oppression with regard to the weight the price the quality and the carriage The avarice of an unlettered governor would supply the ignorance of precept or precedent  The agriculture of the  Roman provinces was insensibly ruined and in the progress of despotism which tends to disappoint its own purpose the emperors were obliged to derive some merit from the forgiveness of debts or the remission of tributes which their subjects were utterly incapable of paying According to the new division of Italy the fertile and happy province of Campania the scene of the early victories and of the delicious retirements of the citizens of Rome extended between the sea and the Appenine from the Tyber to the Silarus Within sixty years after the death of Constantine and on the evidence of an actual survey an exemption was granted in favour of three hundred and thirty thousand English acres of desert and uncultivated land which amounted to oneeighth of the whole surface of the province As the footsteps of the Barbarians had not yet been seen in Italy the cause of this amazing desolation which is recorded in the laws can be ascribed only to the administration of the Roman emperors  Cod Theod l xi tit xxviii leg published the th of March A D by the emperor Honorius only two months after the death of his father Theodosius He speaks of Roman jugera which I have reduced to the English measure The jugerum contained square Roman feet    Either from design or from accident the mode  Assessed in the form of a capitation  of assessment seemed to unite the substance of a  landtax with the forms of a capitation  Godefroy Cod Theod tom vi p argues with weight and learning on the subject of the capitation but while he explains the  caput  as a share or measure of property he too absolutely excludes the idea of a personal assessment  The returns which were sent of every province or district expressed the number of tributary subjects and the amount of the public impositions The latter of these sums was divided by the former and the estimate that such a province contained so many  capita  or heads of tribute and that each  head  was rated at such a price was universally received not only in the popular but even in the legal computation The value of a tributary head must have varied according to many accidental or at least fluctuating circumstances but some knowledge has been preserved of a very curious fact the more important since it relates to one of the richest provinces of the Roman empire and which now flourishes as the most splendid of the European kingdoms The rapacious ministers of Constantius had exhausted the wealth of Gaul by exacting twentyfive pieces of gold for the annual tribute of every head The humane policy of his successor reduced the capitation to seven pieces  Quid profuerit  Julianus  anhelantibus extremâ penuriâ Gallis hinc maxime claret quod primitus partes eas ingressus pro  capitibus  singulis tributi nomine vicenos quinos aureos reperit flagitari discedens vero septenos tantum munera universa complentes Ammian l xvi c  A moderate proportion between these opposite extremes of extraordinary oppression and of transient indulgence may therefore be fixed at sixteen pieces of gold  or about nine pounds sterling the common standard perhaps of the impositions of Gaul  In the calculation of any sum of money under Constantine and his successors we need only refer to the excellent discourse of Mr Greaves on the Denarius for the proof of the following principles That the ancient and modern Roman pound containing grains of Troy weight is about one twelfth lighter than the English pound which is composed of of the same grains That the pound of gold which had once been divided into fortyeight  aurei  was at this time coined into seventytwo smaller pieces of the same denomination That five of these aurei were the legal tender for a pound of silver and that consequently the pound of gold was exchanged for fourteen pounds eight ounces of silver according to the Roman or about thirteen pounds according to the English weight That the English pound of silver is coined into sixtytwo shillings From these elements we may compute the Roman pound of gold the usual method of reckoning large sums at forty pounds sterling and we may fix the currency of the  aureus  at somewhat more than eleven shillings  But this calculation or rather indeed the facts from whence it is deduced cannot fail of suggesting two difficulties to a thinking mind who will be at once surprised by the  equality  and by the  enormity  of the capitation An attempt to explain them may perhaps reflect some light on the interesting subject of the finances of the declining empire  It is obvious that as long as the immutable constitution of human nature produces and maintains so unequal a division of property the most numerous part of the community would be deprived of their subsistence by the equal assessment of a tax from which the sovereign would derive a very trifling revenue Such indeed might be the theory of the Roman capitation but in the practice this unjust equality was no longer  felt as the tribute was collected on the principle of a  real  not of a  personal  imposition Several indigent citizens contributed to compose a single  head  or share of taxation while the wealthy provincial in proportion to his fortune alone represented several of those imaginary beings In a poetical request addressed to one of the last and most deserving of the Roman Princes who reigned in Gaul Sidonius Apollinaris personifies his tribute under the figure of a triple monster the Geryon of the Grecian fables and intreats the new Hercules that he would most

spreading over the face of the country and devouring the substance of an hundred families II The difficulty of allowing an annual sum of about nine pounds sterling even for the average of the capitation of Gaul may be rendered more evident by the comparison of the present state of the same country as it is now governed by the absolute monarch of an industrious wealthy and affectionate people The taxes of France cannot be magnified either by fear or by  flattery beyond the annual amount of eighteen millions sterling which ought perhaps to be shared among fourandtwenty millions of inhabitants  This assertion however formidable it may seem is founded on the original registers of births deaths and marriages collected by public authority and now deposited in the  Contrôle General  at Paris The annual average of births throughout the whole kingdom taken in five years from to both inclusive is boys and girls in all children The province of French Hainault alone furnishes births and we are assured by an actual numeration of the people annually repeated from the year to the year that upon an average Hainault contains inhabitants By the rules of fair analogy we might infer that the ordinary proportion of annual births to the whole people is about to and that the kingdom of France contains persons of both sexes and of every age If we content ourselves with the more moderate proportion of to the whole population will amount to From the diligent researches of the French government which are not unworthy of our own imitation we may hope to obtain a still greater degree of certainty on this important subject  Seven millions of these in the capacity of fathers or brothers or husbands may discharge the obligations of the remaining multitude of women and children yet the equal proportion of each tributary subject will scarcely rise above fifty shillings of our money instead of a proportion almost four times as considerable which was regularly imposed on their Gallic ancestors The reason of this difference may be found not so much in the relative scarcity or plenty of gold and silver as in the different state of society in ancient Gaul and in modern France In a country where personal freedom is the privilege of every subject the whole mass of taxes whether they are levied on property or on consumption may be fairly divided among the whole  body of the nation But the far greater part of the lands of ancient Gaul as well as of the other provinces of the Roman world were cultivated by slaves or by peasants whose dependent condition was a less rigid servitude  Cod Theod l v tit ix x xi Cod Justinian l xi tit lxiii Coloni appellantur qui conditionem debent genitali solo propter agriculturam sub dominio possessorum Augustin de Civitate Dei l x c  In such a state the poor were maintained at the expence of the masters who enjoyed the fruits of their labour and as the rolls of tribute were filled only with the names of those citizens who possessed the means of an honourable or at least of a decent subsistence the comparative smallness of their numbers explains and justifies the high rate of their capitation The truth of this assertion may be illustrated by the following example The Aedui one of the most powerful and civilized tribes or  cities  of Gaul occupied an extent of territory which now contains above five hundred thousand inhabitants in the two ecclesiastical dioceses of Autun and Nevers  The ancient jurisdiction of  Augustodunum  Autun in Burgundy the capital of the Aedui comprehended the adjacent territory of  Noviodunum  Nevers See d'Anville Notice de l'ancienne Gaule p The two dioceses of Autun and Nevers are now composed the former of and the latter of parishes The registers of births taken during eleven years in parishes of the same province of Burgundy and multiplied by the moderate proportion of see Messance Recherches sur la Population p may authorise us to assign an average number of persons for each parish which being again multiplied by the parishes of the dioceses of Nevers and Autun will produce the sum of persons for the extent of country which was once possessed by the Aedui  and with the  probable accession of those of Châlons and Maçon  We might derive an additional supply of inhabitants from the dioceses of Châlons  Cabillonum  and of Maçon  Matisco  since they contain the one and the other parishes This accession of territory might be justified by very specious reasons Châlons and Maçon were undoubtedly within the original jurisdiction of the Aedui See d'Anville Notice p In the Notitia of Gaul they are enumerated not as  Civitates  but merely as  Costra  They do not appear to have been episcopal seats before the fifth and sixth centuries Yet there is a passage in Eumenius Panegyr Vet viii which very forcibly deters me from extending the territory of the Aedui in the reign of Constantine along the beautiful banks of the navigable Saône  the population would amount to eight hundred thousand souls In the time of Constantine the territory of the Aedui afforded no more than twentyfive thousand  heads  of capitation of whom seven thousand were discharged by that prince from the intolerable weight of tribute  Eumenius in Panegyr Vet viii  A just analogy would seem to countenance the opinion of an ingenious historian  L'Abbé du Bos Hist Critique de la M F tom i p  that the free and tributary citizens did not surpass the number of half a million and if in the ordinary administration of government their annual payments may be computed at about four millions and a half of our money it would appear that although the share of each individual was four times as considerable a fourth part only of the modern taxes of France was levied on the Imperial province of Gaul The exactions of Constantius may be calculated at seven millions sterling which were reduced to two millions by the humanity or the wisdom of Julian  But this tax or capitation on the proprietors of land would have suffered a rich and numerous class of free citizens to escape With the view  Capitation on trade and industry  of sharing that species of wealth which is derived from art or labour and which exists in money or in merchandise the emperors imposed a distinct and personal tribute on the trading part of their subjects  See Cod Theod l xiii tit i and iv  Some exemptions very strictly confined both in time and place were allowed to the proprietors who disposed of the produce of their own estates Some indulgence was granted to the profession of the liberal arts but every other branch of commercial industry was affected by the severity of the law The honourable merchant of Alexandria who imported the gems and spices of India for the use of the western world the usurer who derived from the interest of money a silent and ignominious profit the ingenious manufacturer the diligent mechanic and even the most obscure retailer of a sequestered village were obliged to admit the officers of the revenue into the partnership of their gain and the sovereign of the Roman empire who tolerated the profession consented to share the infamous salary of public prostitutes As this general tax upon industry was collected every fourth year it was styled the  Lustral Contribution  and the historian Zosimus  Zosimus l ii p There is probably as much passion and prejudice in the attack of Zosimus as in the elaborate defence of the memory of Constantine by the zealous Dr Howell Hist of the World vol ii p  laments that the approach of the fatal period was announced by the tears and terrors  of the citizens who were often compelled by the impending scourge to embrace the most abhorred and unnatural methods of procuring the sum at which their property had been assessed The testimony of Zosimus cannot indeed be justified from the charge of passion and prejudice but from the nature of this tribute it seems reasonable to conclude that it was arbitrary in the distribution and extremely rigorous in the mode of collecting The secret wealth of commerce and the precarious profits of art or labour are susceptible only of a discretionary valuation which is seldom disadvantageous to the interest of the treasury and as the person of the trader supplies the want of a visible and permanent security the payment of the imposition which in the case of a landtax may be obtained by the seizure of property can rarely be extorted by any other means than those of corporal punishments The cruel treatment of the insolvent debtors of the state is attested and was perhaps mitigated by a very humane edict of Constantine who disclaiming the use of racks and of scourges allots a spacious and airy prison for the place of their confinement  Cod Theod l xi tit vii leg    These general taxes were imposed and levied by the absolute authority of the monarch but the  Free gifts  occasional offerings of the  coronary gold  still retained the name and semblance of popular consent It was an ancient custom that the allies of the republic who ascribed their safety or deliverance  to the success of the Roman arms and even the cities of Italy who admired the virtues of their victorious general adorned the pomp of his triumph by their voluntary gifts of crowns of gold which after the ceremony were consecrated in the temple of Jupiter to remain a lasting monument of his glory to future ages The progress of zeal and flattery soon multiplied the number and increased the size of these popular donations and the triumph of Caesar was enriched with two thousand eight hundred and twentytwo massy crowns whose weight amounted to twenty thousand four hundred and fourteen pounds of gold This treasure was immediately melted down by the prudent dictator who was satisfied that it would be more serviceable to his soldiers than to the gods his example was imitated by his successors and the custom was introduced of exchanging these splendid ornaments for the more acceptable present of the current gold coin of the empire  See Lipsius de Magnitud Romana l ii c The Tarragonese Spain presented the emperor Claudius with a crown of gold of seven and Gaul with another of nine  hundred  pounds weight I have followed the rational emendation of Lipsius  The spontaneous offering was at length exacted as the debt of duty and instead of being confined to the occasion of a triumph it was supposed to be granted by the several cities and provinces of the monarchy as often as the emperor condescended to announce his accession his consulship the birth of a son the creation of a Caesar a victory over the Barbarians or any other real or imaginary event which graced the  annals of his reign The peculiar free gift of the senate of Rome was fixed by custom at sixteen hundred pounds of gold or about sixtyfour thousand pounds sterling The oppressed subjects celebrated their own felicity that their sovereign should graciously consent to accept this feeble but voluntary testimony of their loyalty and gratitude  Cod Theod l xii tit xiii The senators were supposed to be exempt from the  Aurum Coronarium  but the  Auri Oblatio  which was required at their hands was precisely of the same nature    A people elated by pride or soured by discontent  Conclusion  are seldom qualified to form a just estimate of their actual situation The subjects of Constantine were incapable of discerning the decline of genius and manly virtue which so far degraded them below the dignity of their ancestors but they could feel and lament the rage of tyranny the relaxation of discipline and the encrease of taxes The impartial historian who acknowledges the justice of their complaints will observe some favourable circumstances which tended to alleviate the misery of their condition The threatening tempest of Barbarians which so soon subverted the foundations of Roman greatness was still repelled or suspended on the frontiers The arts of luxury and literature were cultivated and the elegant pleasures of society were enjoyed by the inhabitants of a considerable portion of the globe The forms the pomp and the expence of the civil administration contributed to restrain the irregular licence of the soldiers and although the laws were violated by  power or perverted by subtlety the sage principles of the Roman jurisprudence preserved a sense of order and equity unknown to the despotic governments of the east The rights of mankind might derive some protection from religion and philosophy and the name of freedom which could no longer alarm might sometimes admonish the successors of Augustus that they did not reign over a nation of Slaves or Barbarians  The great Theodosius in his judicious advice to his son

country has fixed the attention and divided the opinions of mankind By the grateful zeal of the Christians the deliverer of the church has been decorated with every attribute of a hero and even of a saint while the discontent of the vanquished party has compared Constantine to the most abhorred of those tyrants who by their vice and weakness dishonoured the Imperial purple The same passions have in some degree been perpetuated to succeeding generations and the character of Constantine is considered even in the present age as an object either of satire or of panegyric By the impartial union of those defects which are confessed by his warmest admirers and of those virtues which are acknowledged by his most implacable enemies we might hope to delineate a just portrait of that extraordinary man which the truth and candour of history should adopt without a  blush  On ne se trompera point sur Constantin en croyant tout le mal qu'en dit Eusebe et tout le bien qu'en dit Zosime Fleury Hist Ecclesiastique tom iii p Eusebius and Zosimus form indeed the two extremes of flattery and invective The intermediate shades are expressed by those writers whose character or situation variously tempered the influence of their religious zeal  But it would soon appear that the vain attempt to blend such discordant colours and to reconcile such inconsistent qualities must produce a figure monstrous rather than human unless it is viewed in its proper and distinct lights by a careful separation of the different periods of the reign of Constantine  The person as well as the mind of Constantine  His virtues  had been enriched by nature with her choicest endowments His stature was lofty his countenance majestic his deportment graceful his strength and activity were displayed in every manly exercise and from his earliest youth to a very advanced season of life he preserved the vigour of his constitution by a strict adherence to the domestic virtues of chastity and temperance He delighted in the social intercourse of familiar conversation and though he might sometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with less reserve than was required by the severe dignity of his station the courtesy and liberality of his manners gained the hearts of all who approached him The sincerity of his friendship has been suspected yet he shewed on some occasions that he was not incapable of a warm and lasting attachment The disadvantage of an illiterate education had not prevented him from forming a just estimate  of the value of learning and the arts and sciences derived some encouragement from the munificent protection of Constantine In the dispatch of business his diligence was indefatigable and the active powers of his mind were almost continually exercised in reading writing or meditating in giving audience to ambassadors and in examining the complaints of his subjects Even those who censured the propriety of his measures were compelled to acknowledge that he possessed magnanimity to conceive and patience to execute the most arduous designs without being checked either by the prejudices of education or by the clamours of the multitude In the field he infused his own intrepid spirit into the troops whom he conducted with the talents of a consummate general and to his abilities rather than to his fortune we may ascribe the signal victories which he obtained over the foreign and domestic foes of the republic He loved glory as the reward perhaps as the motive of his labours The boundless ambition which from the moment of his accepting the purple at York appears as the ruling passion of his soul may be justified by the dangers of his own situation by the character of his rivals by the consciousness of superior merit and by the prospect that his success would enable him to restore peace and order to the distracted empire In his civil wars against Maxentius and Licinius he had engaged on his side the inclinations of the people who compared the undissembled vices of those tyrants with the spirit of wisdom and justice which seemed  to direct the general tenor of the administration of Constantine  The virtues of Constantine are collected for the most part from Eutropius and the younger Victor two sincere pagans who wrote after the extinction of his family Even Zosimus and the  Emperor  Julian acknowledge his personal courage and military achievements    Had Constantine fallen on the banks of the  His vices  Tyber or even in the plains of Hadrianople such is the character which with a few exceptions he might have transmitted to posterity But the conclusion of his reign according to the moderate and indeed tender sentence of a writer of the same age degraded him from the rank which he had acquired among the most deserving of the Roman princes  See Eutropius x In primo Imperii tempore optimis principibus ultimo mediis comparandus From the ancient Greek version of Poeanius edit Havercamp p I am inclined to suspect that Eutropius had originally written  vix  mediis and that the offensive monosyllable was dropped by the wilful inadvertency of transcribers Aurelius Victor expresses the general opinion by a vulgar and indeed obscure proverb  Trachala  decem annis praestantissimus duodecim sequentibus  latro  decem novissimis  pupillus  ob immodicas profusiones  In the life of Augustus we behold the tyrant of the republic converted almost by imperceptible degrees into the father of his country and of human kind In that of Constantine we may contemplate a hero who had so long inspired his subjects with love and his enemies with terror degenerating into a cruel and dissolute monarch corrupted by his fortune or raised by conquest above the necessity of dissimulation The general peace which he maintained during the last fourteen years of his reign  A D  was a period of apparent splendor rather than of real prosperity and the old age of Constantine was disgraced by the opposite yet reconcileable vices of rapaciousness and prodigality The accumulated treasures found in the palaces of Maxentius and Licinius were lavishly consumed the various innovations introduced by the conqueror were attended with an encreasing expence the cost of his buildings his court and his festivals required an immediate and plentiful supply and the oppression of the people was the only fund which could support the magnificence of the sovereign  Julian Orat i p in a slattering discourse pronounced before the son of Constantine and Caesares p Zosimus p The stately buildings of Constantinople c may be cuoted as a lasting and unexceptionable proof of the profuseness of their founder  His unworthy favourites enriched by the boundless liberality of their master usurped with impunity the privilege of rapine and corruption  The impartial Ammianus deserves all our confidence Proximorum fauces aperuit primus omnium Constantinus L xvi c Eusebius himself confesses the abuse Vit Constantin l iv c and some of the Imperial laws feebly point out the remedy See above p of this volume  A secret but universal decay was felt in every part of the public administration and the emperor himself though he still retained the obedience gradually lost the esteem of his subjects The dress and manners which towards the decline of life he chose to affect served only to degrade him in the eyes of mankind The Asiatic pomp which had been adopted by the pride of Diocletian assumed an air of softness and effeminacy in the person of Constantine He  is represented with false hair of various colours laboriously arranged by the skilful artists of the times a diadem of a new and more expensive fashion a profusion of gems and pearls of collars and bracelets and a variegated flowing robe of silk most curiously embroidered with flowers of gold In such apparel scarcely to be excused by the youth and folly of Elagabalus we are at a loss to discover the wisdom of an aged monarch and the simplicity of a Roman veteran  Julian in the Caesars attempts to ridicule his uncle His suspicious testimony is confirmed however by the learned Spanheim with the authority of medals See Commentaire p Eusebius Orat c alleges that Constantine dressed for the public not for himself Were this admitted the vainest coxcomb could never want an excuse  A mind thus relaxed by prosperity and indulgence was incapable of rising to that magnanimity which disdains suspicion and dares to forgive The deaths of Maximian and Licinius may perhaps be justified by the maxims of policy as they are taught in the schools of tyrants but an impartial narrative of the executions or rather murders which sullied the declining age of Constantine will suggest to our most candid thoughts the idea of a prince who could sacrifice without reluctance the laws of justice and the feelings of nature to the dictates either of his passions or of his interest  The same fortune which so invariably followed  His family  the standard of Constantine seemed to secure the hopes and comforts of his domestic life Those among his predecessors who had enjoyed the longest and most prosperous reigns Augustus  Trajan and Diocletian had been disappointed of posterity and the frequent revolutions had never allowed sufficient time for any Imperial family to grow up and multiply under the shade of the purple But the royalty of the Flavian line which had been first ennobled by the Gothic Claudius descended through several generations and Constantine himself derived from his royal father the hereditary honours which he transmitted to his children The emperor had been twice married Minervina the obscure but lawful object of his youthful attachment  Zosimus and Zonaras agree in representing Minervina as the concubine of Constantine but Ducange has very gallantly rescued her character by producing a decisive passage from one of the panegyrics "Ab ipso fine pueritiae te matrimonii legibus dedisti"  had left him only one son who was

the elder brother That of Hannibalianus is mentioned in the Paschal chronicle and is approved by Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p  were permitted to enjoy the most honourable rank and the most affluent fortune that could be consistent with a private station The youngest of the three lived without a name and died without posterity His two elder brothers obtained in marriage the daughters of wealthy senators and propagated new branches of the Imperial race Gallus and  Julian afterwards became the most illustrious of the children of Julius Constantius the  Patrician  The two sons of Dalmatius who had been decorated with the vain title of  Censor  were named Dalmatius and Hannibalianus The two sisters of the great Constantine Anastasia and Eurropia were bestowed on Optatus and Nepotianus two senators of noble birth and of consular dignity His third sister Constantia was distinguished by her preeminence of greatness and of misery She remained the widow of the vanquished Licinius and it was by her entreaties that an innocent boy the offspring of their marriage preserved for some time his life the title of Caesar and a precarious hope of the succession Besides the females and the allies of the Flavian house ten or twelve males to whom the language of modern courts would apply the title of princes of the blood seemed according to the order of their birth to be destined either to inherit or to support the throne of Constantine But in less than thirty years this numerous and encreasing family was reduced to the persons of Constantius and Julian who alone had survived a series of crimes and calamities such as the tragic poets have deplored in the devoted lines of Pelops and of Cadmus  Crispus the eldest son of Constantine and the  Virtues of Crispus  presumptive heir of the empire is represented by impartial historians as an amiable and accomplished youth The care of his education or at least of his studies was entrusted to Lactantius the most eloquent of the Christians a praeceptor  admirably qualified to form the taste and to excite the virtues of his illustrious disciple  Jerom in Chron The poverty of Lactantius may be applied either to the praise of the disinterested philosopher or to the shame of the unfeeling patron See Tillemont Mem Ecclesiast tom vi part i p Dupin Bibliothéque Ecclesiast tom i p Lardner's Credibility of the Gospel History part ii vol vii p  At the age of seventeen Crispus was invested with the title of Caesar and the administration of the Gallic provinces where the inroads of the Germans gave him an early occasion of signalizing his military prowess In the civil war which broke out soon afterwards the father and son divided their powers and this history has already celebrated the valour as well as conduct displayed by the latter in forcing the streights of the Hellespont so obstinately defended by the superior fleet of Licinius This naval victory contributed to determine the event of the war and the names of Constantine and of Crispus were united in the joyful acclamations of their eastern subjects who loudly proclaimed that the world had been subdued and was now governed by an emperor endowed with every virtue and by his illustrious son a prince beloved of heaven and the lively image of his father's perfections The public favour which seldom accompanies oldage disfused its lustre over the youth of Crispus He deserved the esteem and he engaged the affections of the court the army and the people The experienced merit of a reigning monarch is acknowledged by his subjects with reluctance and frequently denied with partial and discontented  murmurs while from the opening virtues of his successor they fondly conceive the most unbounded hopes of private as well as public felicity  Euseb Hist Ecclesiast l x c Eutropius x styles him "egregium virum" and Julian Orat i very plainly alludes to the exploits of Crispus in the civil war See Spanheim Comment p    This dangerous popularity soon excited the attention  Jealousy of Constantine  of Constantine who both as a father and as a king was impatient of an equal Instead of  A D Oct  attempting to secure the allegiance of his son by the generous ties of confidence and gratitude he resolved to prevent the mischiefs which might be apprehended from dissatisfied ambition Crispus soon had reason to complain that while his infant brother Constantius was sent with the title of Caesar to reign over his peculiar department of the Gallic provinces  Compare Idatius and the Paschal Chronicle with Ammianus l xiv c The  year  in which Constantius was created Caesar seems to be more accurately fixed by the two chronologists but the historian who lived in his court could not be ignorant of the  day  of the anniversary For the appointment of the new Caesar to the provinces of Gaul see Julian Orat i p Godefroy Chronol Legum p and Blondel de la Primauté de l'Eglise p    he  a prince of mature years who had performed such recent and signal services instead of being raised to the superior rank of Augustus was confined almost a prisoner to his father's court and exposed without power or defence to every calumny which the malice of his enemies could suggest Under such painful circumstances the royal youth might not always be able to compose his behaviour or suppress his discontent and we may be assured that he was  encompassed by a train of indiscreet or perfidious followers who assiduously studied to inflame and who were perhaps instructed to betray the unguarded warmth of his resentment An edict of  A D October  Constantine published about this time manifestly indicates his real or affected suspicions that a secret conspiracy had been formed against his person and government By all the allurements of honours and rewards he invites informers of every degree to accuse without exception his magistrates or ministers his friends or his most intimate favourites protesting with a solemn asseveration that he himself will listen to the charge that he himself will revenge his injuries and concluding with a prayer which discovers some apprehension of danger that the providence of the Supreme Being may still continue to protect the safety of the emperor and of the empire  Cod Theod l ix tit iv Godesroy suspected the secret motives of this law Comment tom iii p    The informers who

favourite sister pleading for the life of a son whose rank was his only crime and whose loss she did not long survive The story of these unhappy princes the nature and evidence of their guilt the

a prudent silence on the subject of these tragic events  See the Life of Constantine particularly l ii c Two hundred and fifty years afterwards Evagrius l iii c deduced from the silence of Eusebius a vain argument against the reality of the fact  Such haughty contempt for the opinion of mankind whilst it imprints an indelible stain on the memory of Constantine must remind us of the very different behaviour of one of  the greatest monarchs of the present age The Czar Peter in the full possession of despotic power submitted to the judgment of Russia of Europe and of posterity the reasons which had compelled him to subscribe the condemnation of a criminal or at least of a degenerate son  Histoire de Pierre le Grand par Voltaire part ii c x    The innocence of Crispus was so universally acknowledged  The empress Fausta  that the modern Greeks who adore the memory of their founder are reduced to palliate the guilt of a parricide which the common feelings of human nature forbade them to justify They pretend that as soon as the afflicted father discovered the falsehood of the accusation by which his credulity had been so fatally misled he published to the world his repentance and remorse that he mourned forty days during which he abstained from the use of the bath and all the ordinary comforts of life and that for the lasting instruction of posterity he erected a golden statue of Crispus with this memorable inscription TO MY SON WHOM I UNJUSTLY CONDEMNED  In order to prove that the statue was erected by Constantine and afterwards concealed by the malice of the Arians Codinus very readily creates p two witnesses Hippolitus and the younger Herodotus to whose imaginary histories he appeals with unblushing confidence  A tale so moral and so interesting would deserve to be supported by less exceptionable authority but if we consult the more ancient and authentic writers they will inform us that the repentance of Constantine was manifested only in acts of blood and revenge and that he atoned for the murder of an innocent son by the execution  perhaps of a guilty wife They ascribe the misfortunes of Crispus to the arts of his stepmother Fausta whose implacable hatred or whose disappointed love renewed in the palace of Constantine the ancient tragedy of Hippolitus and of Phaedra  Zosimus l ii p may be considered as our original The ingenuity of the moderns assisted by a few hints from the ancients has illustrated and improved his obscure and imperfect narrative  Like the daughter of Minos the daughter of Maximian accused her son inlaw of an incestuous attempt on the chastity of his father's wife and easily obtained from the jealousy of the emperor a sentence of death against a young prince whom she considered with reason as the most formidable rival of her own children But Helena the aged mother of Constantine lamented and revenged the untimely fate of her grandson Crispus nor was it long before a real or pretended discovery was made that Fausta herself entertained a criminal connection with a slave belonging to the Imperial stables  Philostorgius l ii c Zosimus l ii p imputes to Constantine the death of two wives of the innocent Fausta and of an adulteress who was the mother of his three successors According to Jerom three or four years elapsed between the death of Crispus and that of Fausta The elder Victor is prudently silent  Her condemnation and punishment were the instant consequences of the charge and the adulteress was suffocated by the steam of a bath which for that purpose had been heated to an extraordinary degree  If Fausta was put to death it is reasonable to believe that the private apartments of the palace were the scene of her execution The orator Chrysostom indulges his fancy by exposing the naked empress on a desert mountain to be devoured by wild beasts  By some it will perhaps be  thought that the remembrance of a conjugal union of twenty years and the honour of their common offspring the destined heirs of the throne might have softened the obdurate heart of Constantine and persuaded him to suffer his wife however guilty she might appear to expiate her offences in a solitary prison But it seems a superfluous labour to weigh the propriety unless we could ascertain the truth of this singular event which is attended with some circumstances of doubt and perplexity Those who have attacked and those who have defended the character of Constantine have alike disregarded two very remarkable passages of two orations pronounced under the succeeding reign The former celebrates the virtues the beauty and the fortune of the empress Fausta the daughter wife sister and mother of so many princes  Julian Orat i He seems to call her the mother of Crispus She might assume that title by adoption At least she was not considered as his mortal enemy Julian compares the fortune of Fausta with that of Parysatis the Persian queen A Roman would have more naturally recollected the second Agrippina  Et moi qui sur le trone ai suivi mes ancêtres  Moi fille femme soeur et mere de vos maitres  The latter asserts in explicit terms that the mother of the younger Constantine who was slain three years after his father's death survived to weep over the fate of her son  Monod in Constantin Jun c ad Calcem Eutrop edit Havercamp The orator styles her the most divine and pious of queens  Notwithstanding the positive testimony of several writers of the Pagan  as well as of the Christian religion there may still remain some reason to believe or at least to suspect that Fausta escaped the blind and suspicious cruelty of her husband The deaths of a son and of a nephew with the execution of a great number of respectable and perhaps innocent friends  Interfecit numerosos amicos Eutrop xx  who were involved in their fall may be sufficient however to justify the discontent of the Roman people and to explain the satirical verses affixed to the palacegate comparing the splendid and bloody reigns of Constantine and Nero  Saturni aurea saecula quis requirat  Sunt haec gemmea sed Neroniana  Sidon Apollinar v  It is somewhat singular that these satirical lines should be attributed not to an obscure libeller or a disappointed patriot but to Ablavius prime minister and favourite of the emperor We may now perceive that the imprecations of the Roman people were dictated by humanity

already mentioned under the names of Constantine of Constantius and of Constans These young princes were successively invested with the title of Caesar and the dates of their promotion may be referred to the tenth the twentieth and the thirtieth years of the reign of their father  Euseb Orat in Constantin c These dates are sufficiently correct to justify the orator  This conduct though it tended to multiply the future masters of the Roman world might be excused by the partiality of paternal affection but it is not easy to understand  the motives of the emperor when he endangered the safety both of his family and of his people by the unnecessary elevation of his two nephews Dalmatius and Hannibalianus The former was raised by the title of Caesar to an equality with his cousins In favour of the latter Constantine invented the new and singular appellation of  Nobilissimus  Zosim l ii p Under the predecessors of Constantine  Nobilissimus  was a vague epithet rather than a legal and determined title  to which he annexed the flattering distinction of a robe of purple and gold But of the whole series of Roman princes in any age of the empire Hannibalianus alone was distinguished by the title of KING a name which the subjects of Tiberius would have detested as the profane and cruel insult of capricious tyranny The use of such a title even as it appears under the reign of Constantine is a strange and unconnected fact which can scarcely be admitted on the joint authority of Imperial medals and contemporary writers  Adstruunt nummi veteres ac singulares Spanheim de Usu

and running that he was a dextrous archer a skilful horseman and a master of all the different weapons used in the service either of the cavalry or of the infantry  His dexterity in martial exercise is celebrated by Julian Orat i p Orat ii p and allowed by Ammianus l xxi c  The same assiduous cultivation was bestowed though not perhaps with equal success to improve the minds of the sons and nephews of Constantine  Euseb in Vit Constantin l iv c Julian Orat i p with Spanheim's elaborate Commentary Libanius Orat iii p Constantius studied with laudable diligence but the dulness of his fancy prevented him from succeeding in the art of poetry or even of rhetoric  The most celebrated professors of the Christian faith of the Grecian philosophy and of the Roman jurisprudence were invited by the liberality of the emperor who reserved for himself the important task of instructing the royal youths in the science of government and the knowledge of mankind But the genius of Constantine himself had been formed by adversity and experience In the free intercourse of private life and amidst the dangers of the court of Galerius he had learned to command his own passions to encounter those of his equals and to depend for his present safety and future greatness on the prudence and firmness of his personal conduct His destined successors had the misfortune of being born and educated in the Imperial purple Incessantly surrounded with a train of flatterers they passed their youth in the enjoyment of luxury and the expectation of a throne nor would the dignity of their rank permit  them to descend from that elevated station from whence the various characters of human nature appear to wear a smooth and uniform aspect The indulgence of Constantine admitted them at a very tender age to share the administration of the empire and they studied the art of reigning at the expence of the people entrusted to their care The younger Constantine was appointed to hold his court in Gaul and his brother Constantius exchanged that department the ancient patrimony of their father for the more opulent but less martial countries of the East Italy the Western Illyricum and Africa were accustomed to revere Constans the third of his sons as the representative of the great Constantine He fixed Dalmatius on the Gothic frontier to which he annexed the government of Thrace Macedonia and Greece The city of Caesarea was chosen for the residence of Hannibalianus and the provinces of Pontus Cappadocia and the Lesser Armenia were designed to form the extent of his new kingdom For each of these princes a suitable establishment was provided A just proportion of guards of legions and of auxiliaries was allotted for their respective dignity and defence The ministers and generals who were placed about their persons were such as Constantine could trust to assist and even to control these youthful sovereigns in the exercise of their delegated power As they advanced in years and experience the limits of their authority were insensibly enlarged but the emperor always reserved for himself the title of Augustus  and while he shewed the  Caesars  to the armies and provinces he maintained every part of the empire in equal obedience to its supreme head  Eusebius l iv c with a design of exalting the authority and glory of Constantine affirms that he divided the Roman empire as a private citizen might have divided his patrimony His distribution of the provinces may be collected from Eutropius the two Victors and the Valesian fragment  The tranquillity of the last fourteen years of his reign was scarcely interrupted by the contemptible insurrection of a cameldriver in the island of Cyprus  Calocerus the obscure leader of this rebellion or rather tumult was apprehended and burnt alive in the marketplace of Tarsus by the vigilance of Dalmatius See the elder Victor the Chronicle of Jerom and the doubtful traditions of Theophanes and Cedrenus  or by the active part which the policy of Constantine engaged him to assume in the wars of the Goths and Sarmatians  Among the different branches of the human  Manners of the Sarmatians  race the Sarmatians form a very remarkable shade as they seem to unite the manners of the Asiatic barbarians with the figure and complexion of the ancient inhabitants of Europe According to the various accidents of peace and war of alliance or conquest the Sarmatians were sometimes confined to the banks of the Tanais and they sometimes spread themselves over the immense plains which lie between the Vistula and the Volga  Cellarius has collected the opinions of the ancients concerning the European and Asiatic Sarmatia and M d'Anville has applied them to modern geography with the skill and accuracy which always distinguishes that excellent writer  The care of their numerous flocks and herds the pursuit of game and the exercise of war or rather of rapine directed the vagrant  motions of the Sarmatians The moveable camps or cities the ordinary residence of their wives and children consisted only of large waggons drawn by oxen and covered in the form of tents The military strength of the nation was composed of cavalry and the custom of their warriors to lead in their hand one or two spare horses enabled them to advance and to retreat with a rapid diligence which surprised the security and eluded the pursuit of a distant enemy  Ammian l xvii c The Sarmatian horses were castrated to prevent the mischievous accidents which might happen from the noisy and ungovernable passions of the males  Their poverty of iron prompted their rude industry to invent a sort of cuirass which was capable of resisting a sword or javelin though it was formed only of horses hoofs cut into thin and polished slices carefully laid over each other in the manner of scales or feathers and strongly sewed upon an undergarment of coarse linen  Pausanias l i p edit Kuhn That inquisitive traveller had carefully examined a Sarmatian cuirass which was preserved in the temple of Aesculapius at Athens  The offensive arms of the Sarmatians were short daggers long lances and a weighty bow with a quiver of arrows They were reduced to the necessity of employing fishbones for the points of their weapons but the custom of dipping them in a venomous liquor that poisoned the wounds which they inflicted is alone sufficient to prove the most savage manners since a people impressed with a sense of humanity would have abhorred so cruel a practice and a nation skilled in the arts of war would have disdained so impotent a resource  Aspicis et mitti sub adunco toxica ferro  Et telum causas mortis habere duas  Ovid ex Ponto l iv ep ver See in the Recherches sur les Americains tom ii p a very curious dissertation on poisoned darts The venom was commonly extracted from the vegetable reign but that employed by the Scythians appears to have been drawn from the viper and a mixture of human blood The use of poisoned arms which has been spread over both worlds never preserved a savage tribe from the arms of a disciplined enemy    Whenever these Barbarians issued from their deserts in quest of prey their shaggy beards uncombed locks the furs with which they were covered from head to foot and their fierce countenances which seemed to express the innate cruelty of their minds inspired the more civilized provincials of Rome with horror and dismay  The tender Ovid after a youth spent in the enjoyment  Their settlement near the Danube  of fame and luxury was condemned to an hopeless exile on the frozen banks of the Danube where he was exposed almost without defence to the fury of these monsters of the desert with whose stern spirits he feared that his gentle shade might hereafter be confounded In his pathetic but sometimes unmanly lamentations  The nine books of Poetical Epistles which Ovid composed during the seven first years of his melancholy exile possess besides the merit of elegance a double value They exhibit a picture of the human mind under very singular circumstances and they contain many curious observations which no Roman except Ovid could have an opportunity of making Every circumstance which tends to illustrate the history of the Barbarians has been drawn together by the very accurate Count de Buat Hist Ancienne des Peuples de l'Europe tom iv c xvi p  he describes in the most lively colours the dress and manners the arms and inroads of the Getae  and Sarmatians who were associated for the purposes of destruction and from the accounts of history there is some reason to believe that these Sarmatians were the Jazygae one of the most numerous and warlike tribes of the nation The allurements of plenty engaged them to seek a permanent establishment on the frontiers of the empire Soon after the reign of Augustus they obliged the Dacians who subsisted by fishing on the banks of the river Teyss or Tibiscus to retire into the hilly country and to abandon to the victorious Sarmatians the fertile plains of the Upper Hungary which are bounded by the course of the Danube and the semicircular inclosure of the Carpathian mountains  The Sarmatians Jazygae were settled on the banks of the Pathissus or Tibiscus when Pliny in the year published his Natural History See l iv c In the time of Strabo and Ovid sixty or seventy years before they appear to have inhabited beyond the Getae along the coast of the Euxine  In this advantageous position they watched or suspended the moment of attack as they were provoked by injuries or appeased by presents they gradually acquired the skill of using more dangerous weapons and although the Sarmatians did not illustrate their name by any memorable exploits they occasionally assisted their eastern and western neighbours the Goths and the Germans with a formidable body of cavalry They lived under the irregular aristocracy of their chieftains  Principes Sarmatarum Jazygum penes quos civitatis regimen plebem quoque et vim equitum quâ solâ valent offerebant Tacit Hist iii This offer was made in the civil war between Vitellius and Vespasian  but after they had received into their bosom the fugitive Vandals  who yielded to the pressure of the Gothic power they seem to have chosen a king from that nation and from the illustrious race of the Astingi who had formerly dwelt on the shores of the Northern ocean  This hypothesis of a Vandal king reigning over Sarmatian subjects seems necessary to reconcile the Goth Jornandes with the Greek and Latin historians of Constantine It may be observed that Isidore who lived in Spain under the dominion of the Goths gives them for enemies not the Vandals but the Sarmatians See his Chronicle in Grotius p    This motive of enmity must have inflamed the subjects of contention which perpetually arise on  The Gothic war  the confines of warlike and independent nations  A D  The Vandal princes were stimulated by fear and revenge the Gothic kings aspired to extend their dominion from the Euxine to the frontiers of Germany and the waters of the Maros a small river which falls into the Teyss were stained with the blood of the contending Barbarians After some experience of the superior strength and numbers of their adversaries the Sarmatians implored the protection of the Roman monarch who beheld with pleasure the discord of the nations but who was justly alarmed by the progress of the Gothic arms As soon as Constantine had declared himself in favour of the weaker party the haughty Araric king of the Goths instead of expecting the attack of the Legions boldly passed the Danube and spread terror and devastation through the province of Maesia To oppose the inroad of this destroying host the aged emperor took the field in person but on this occasion either his conduct or his fortune betrayed the glory which he had acquired in so many foreign  and domestic wars He had the mortification of seeing his troops fly before an inconsiderable detachment of the Barbarians who pursued them to the edge of their fortified camp and obliged him to consult his safety by a precipitate and ignominious retreat The event of a second and more successful action retrieved the honour of the Roman name and the powers of art and discipline prevailed after an obstinate contest over the efforts of irregular valour The broken army of the Goths abandoned the field of battle the wasted province and the passage of the Danube and although the eldest of the sons of Constantine was permitted to supply the place of his father  A D April  the merit of the victory which diffused universal joy was ascribed to the auspicious counsels of the emperor himself  He contributed at least to improve this advantage by his negociations with the free and warlike people of Chersonesus  I may stand in need of some apology for having used without scruple the authority of Constantine Porphyrogenitus in all that relates to the wars and negociations of the Chersonites I am aware that he was a Greek of the tenth century and that his accounts of ancient history are frequently confused and fabulous But on this occasion his narrative is for the most part consistent and probable nor is there much difficulty in conceiving that an emperor might have access to some secret archives which had escaped the diligence of meaner historians For the situation and history of Chersone see Peyssonel des Peuples barbares qui ont habité les Bords du Danube c xvi p  whose capital situate on the western coast of the Tauric or Crimaean peninsula still retained some vestiges of a Grecian colony and was governed by a perpetual magistrate assisted by a council of senators emphatically styled the Fathers of the City The Chersonites  were animated against the Goths by the memory of the wars which in the preceding century they had maintained with unequal forces against the invaders of their country They were connected with the Romans by the mutual benefits of commerce as they were supplied from the provinces of Asia with corn and manufactures which they purchased with their only productions salt wax and hides Obedient to the requisition of Constantine they prepared under the conduct of their magistrate Diogenes a considerable army of which the principal strength consisted in crossbows and military chariots The speedy march and intrepid attack of the Chersonites by diverting the attention of the Goths assisted the operations of the Imperial generals The Goths vanquished on every side were driven into the mountains where in the course of a severe campaign above an hundred thousand were computed to have perished by cold and hunger Peace was at length granted to their humble supplications the eldest son of Araric was accepted as the most valuable hostage and Constantine endeavoured to convince their chiefs by a liberal distribution of honours and rewards how far the friendship of the Romans was preferable to their enmity In the expressions of his gratitude towards the faithful Chersonites the emperor was still more magnificent The pride of the nation was gratified by the splendid and almost royal decorations bestowed on their magistrate and his successors A perpetual exemption from all duties was stipulated for their vessels which traded to the ports of the Black Sea A regular subsidy was promised of  iron corn oil and of every supply which could be useful either in peace or war But it was thought that the Sarmatians were sufficiently rewarded by their deliverance from impending ruin and the emperor perhaps with too strict an oeconomy deducted some part of the expences of the war from the customary gratifications which were allowed to that turbulent nation  Exasperated by this apparent neglect the Sarmatians  Expulsion of the Sarmatians  soon forgot with the levity of Barbarians the services which they had so lately received  A D  and the dangers which still threatened their safety Their inroads on the territory of the empire provoked the indignation of Constantine to leave them to their fate and he no longer opposed the ambition of Geberic a renowned warrior who had recently ascended the Gothic throne Wisumar the Vandal king whilst alone and unassisted he defended his dominions with undaunted courage was vanquished and slain in a decisive battle which swept away the flower of the Sarmatian youth The remainder of the nation embraced the desperate expedient of arming their slaves a hardy race of hunters and herdsmen by whose tumultuary aid they revenged their defeat and expelled the invader from their confines But they soon discovered that they had exchanged a foreign for a domestic enemy more dangerous and more implacable Enraged by their former servitude elated by their present glory the slaves under the name of Limigantes claimed and usurped the possession of the country which they had saved Their masters unable to withstand the ungoverned fury of the populace preferred  the hardships of exile to the tyranny of their servants Some of the fugitive Sarmatians solicited a less ignominious dependence under the hostile standard of the Goths A more numerous band retired beyond the Carpathian mountains among the Quadi their German allies and were easily admitted to share a superfluous waste of uncultivated land But the far greater part of the distressed nation turned their eyes towards the fruitful provinces of Rome Imploring the protection and forgiveness of the emperor they solemnly promised as subjects in peace and as soldiers in war the most inviolable fidelity to the empire which should graciously receive them into its bosom According to the maxims adopted by Probus and his successors the offers of this Barbarian colony were eagerly accepted and a competent portion of lands in the provinces of Pannonia Thrace Macedonia and Italy were immediately assigned for the habitation and subsistence of three hundred thousand Sarmatians  The Gothic and Sarmatian

mourning surpassed whatever had been practised on any former occasion Notwithstanding the claims of the senate and people of ancient Rome the corpse of the deceased emperor according to his last request was transported to the city which was destined to preserve the name and memory of its founder The body of Constantine adorned with the vain symbols of greatness the purple and  diadem was deposited on a golden bed in one of the apartments of the palace which for that purpose had been splendidly furnished and illuminated The forms of the court were strictly maintained Every day at the appointed hours the principal officers of the state the army and the household approaching the person of their sovereign with bended kees and a composed countenance offered their respectful homage as seriously as if he had been still alive From motives of policy this theatrical representation was for some time continued nor could flattery neglect the opportunity of remarking that Constantine alone by the peculiar indulgence of heaven had reigned after his death  Funus relatum in urbem sui nominis quod sane P R aegerrime tulit Aurelius Victor Constantine had prepared for himself a stately tomb in the church of the Holy Apostles Euseb l iv c The best and indeed almost the only account of the sickness death and funeral of Constantine is contained in the fourth book of his Life by Eusebius    But this reign could subsist only in empty pageantry  Factions of the court  and it was soon discovered that the will of the most absolute monarch is seldom obeyed when his subjects have no longer any thing to hope from his favour or to dread from his resentment The same ministers and generals who bowed with such reverential awe before the inanimate corpse of their deceased sovereign were engaged in secret consultations to exclude his two nephews Dalmatius and Hannibalianus from the share which he had assigned them in the succession of the empire We are too imperfectly acquainted  with the court of Constantine to form any judgment of the real motives which influenced the leaders of the conspiracy unless we should suppose that they were actuated by a spirit of jealousy and revenge against the praefect Ablavius a proud favourite who had long directed the counsels and abused the confidence of the late emperor The arguments by which they solicited the concurrence of the soldiers and people are of a more obvious nature and they might with decency as well as truth insist on the superior rank of the children of Constantine the danger of multiplying the number of sovereigns and the impending mischiefs which threatened the republic from the discord of so many rival princes who were not connected by the tender sympathy of fraternal affection The intrigue was conducted with zeal and secrecy till a loud and unanimous declaration was procured from the troops that they would suffer none except the sons of their lamented monarch to reign over the Roman empire  Eusebius l iv c terminates his narrative by this loyal declaration of the troops and avoids all the invidious circumstances of the subsequent massacre  The younger Dalmatius who was united with his collateral relations by the ties of friendship and interest is allowed to have inherited a considerable share of the abilities of the great Constantine but on this occasion he does not appear to have concerted any measures for supporting by arms the just claims which himself and his royal brother derived from the liberality of their uncle Astonished and overwhelmed by the tide of popular  fury they seem to have remained without the power of flight or of resistance in the hands of their implacable enemies Their fate was suspended till the arrival of Constantius the second  The character of Dalmatius is advantageously though concisely drawn by Eutropius x Dalmatius Caesar prosperrimâ indole neque patruo absimilis  haud multo  post oppressus est factione militari As both Jerom and the Alexandrian Chronicle mention the third year of the Caesar which did not commence till the th or th of September A D it is certain that these military factions continued above four months  and perhaps the most favoured of the sons of Constantine  The voice of the dying emperor had recommended  Massacre of the princes  the care of his funeral to the piety of Constantius and that prince by the vicinity of his eastern station could easily prevent the diligence of his brothers who resided in their distant government of Italy and Gaul As soon as he had taken possession of the palace of Constantinople his first care was to remove the apprehensions of his kinsmen by a solemn oath which he pledged for their security His next employment was to find some specious pretence which might release his conscience from the obligation of an imprudent promise The arts of fraud were made subservient to the designs of cruelty and a manifest forgery was attested by a person of the most sacred character From the hands of the bishop of Nicomedia Constantius received a fatal scroll affirmed to be the genuine testament of his father in which the emperor expressed his suspicions that he had been poisoned by his brothers and conjured his sons to revenge his death  and to consult their own safety by the punishment of the guilty  I have related this singular anecdote on the authority of Philostorgius l ii c But if such a pretext was ever used by Constantine and his adherents it was laid aside with contempt as soon as it had served their immediate purpose Athanasius tom i p mentions the oath which Constantius had taken for the security of his kinsmen  Whatever reasons might have been alleged by these unfortunate princes to defend their life and honour against so incredible an accusation they were silenced by the furious clamours of the soldiers who declared themselves at once their enemies their judges and their executioners The spirit and even the forms of legal proceedings were repeatedly violated in a promiscuous massacre which involved the two uncles of Constantius seven of his cousins of whom Dalmatius and Hannibalianus were the most illustrious the Patrician Optatus who had married a sister of the late emperor and the Praefect Ablavius whose power and riches had inspired him with some hopes of obtaining the purple If it were necessary to aggravate the horrors of this bloody scene we might add that Constantius himself had espoused the daughter of his uncle Julius and that he had bestowed his sister in marriage on his cousin Hannibalianus These alliances which the policy of Constantine regardless of the public prejudice  Conjugia sobrinarum diu ignorata tempore addito percrebuisse Tacit Annal xii and Lipsius ad loc The repeal of the ancient law and the practice of five hundred years were insufficient to cradicate the prejudices of the Romans who still considered the marriages of cousinsgerman as a species of imperfect incest Augustin de Civitate De xv and Julian whose mind was biassed by superstition and resentment stigmatizes these unnatural alliances between his own cousins with the opprobrious epithet of  Orat vii p The jurisprudence of the canons has since revived and enforced this prohibition without being able to introduce it either into the civil or the common law of Europe See on the subject of these marriages Taylor's Civil Law p Brouer de Jure Connub l ii c

of youth and innocence Of so numerous a family Gallus and Julian alone the two youngest children of Julius Constantius were saved from the hands of the assassins till their rage satiated with slaughter had in some measure subsided The emperor Constantius who in the absence of his brothers was the most obnoxious to guilt and reproach discovered on some future occasions a faint and transient remorse for those cruelties which the perfidious counsels of his ministers and the irresistible violence of the troops had extorted from his unexperienced youth  Julian ad S P Q Athen p charges his cousin Constantius with the whole guilt of a massacre from which he himself so narrowly escaped His assertion is confirmed by Athanasius who for reasons of a very different nature was not less an

Narses who after the victory of Galerius had humbly confessed the superiority of the Roman power Although Sapor was in the thirtieth year of his long reign he was still in the vigour of youth as the date of his accession by a very strange fatality had preceded that of his birth The wife of Hormouz remained pregnant at the time of her husband's death and the uncertainty  of the sex as well as of the event excited the ambitious hopes of the princes of the house of Sassan The apprehensions of civil war were at length removed by the positive assurance of the Magi that the widow of Hormouz had conceived and would safely produce a son Obedient to the voice of superstition the Persians prepared without delay the ceremony of his coronation A royal bed on which the queen lay in state was exhibited in the midst of the palace the diadem was placed on the spot which might be supposed to conceal the future heir of Artaxerxes and the prostrate Satraps adored the majesty of their invisible and insensible sovereign  Agathias who lived in the sixth century is the author of this story l iv p edit Louvre He derived his information from some extracts of the Persian Chronicles obtained and translated by the interpreter Sergius during his embassy at that court The coronation of the mother of Sapor is likewise mentioned by Schikard Tarikh p and d'Herbelot Bibliotheque Orientale p  If any credit can be given to this marvellous tale which seems however to be countenanced by the manners of the people and by the extraordinary duration of his reign we must admire not only the fortune but the genius of Sapor In the soft sequestered education of a Persian haram the royal youth could discover the importance of exercising the vigour of his mind and body and by his personal merit deserved a throne on which he had been seated while he was yet unconscious of the duties and temptations of absolute power His minority was exposed to the almost inevitable calamities of domestic discord his capital was  surprised and plundered by Thair a powerful king of Yemen or Arabia and the majesty of the royal family was degraded by the captivity of a princess the sister of the deceased king But as soon as Sapor attained the age of manhood the presumptuous Thair his nation and his country fell beneath the first effort of the young warrior who used his victory with so judicious a mixture of rigour and clemency that he obtained from the fears and gratitude of the Arabs the title of  Dhoulacnaf  or protector of the nation  D'Herbelot Bibliotheque Orientale p    The ambition of the Persian to whom his enemies  State of Mesopotamia and Armenia  ascribe the virtues of a soldier and a statesman was animated by the desire of revenging the disgrace of his fathers and of wresting from the hands of the Romans the five provinces beyond the Tigris The military same of Constantine and the real or apparent strength of his government suspended the attack and while the hostile conduct of Sapor provoked the resentment his artful negociations amused the patience of the Imperial court The death of Constantine was the signal of war  Sextus Rufus c who on this occasion is no contemptible

preliminaries if not the ratification of the treaty See Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p  and the actual condition of the Syrian and Armenian frontier seemed to encourage the Persians by the prospect of a rich spoil and an easy conquest The example of the massacres of the palace diffused a spirit of licentiousness  and sedition among the troops of the east who were no longer restrained by their habits of obedience to a veteran commander By the prudence of Constantius who from the interview with his brothers in Pannonia immediately hastened to the banks of the Euphrates the legions were gradually restored to a sense of duty and discipline but the season of anarchy had permitted Sapor to form the siege of Nisibis and to occupy several of the most important fortresses of Mesopotamia  Julian Orat i p  In Armenia the renowned Tiridates had long enjoyed the peace and glory which he deserved by his valour and fidelity to the cause of Rome The firm alliance which he maintained with Constantine was productive of spiritual as well as of temporal benefits by the conversion of Tiridates the character of a saint was applied to that of a hero the Christian faith was preached and established from the Euphrates to the shores of the Caspian and Armenia was attached to the empire by the double ties of policy and of religion But as many of the Armenian nobles still refused to abandon the plurality of their gods and of their wives the public tranquillity was disturbed by a discontented faction which insulted the feeble age of their sovereign and impatiently expected the hour of his death He died at length after a reign of  A D  fiftysix years and the fortune of the Armenian monarchy expired with Tiridates His lawful heir was driven into exile the Christian priests  were either murdered or expelled from their churches the barbarous tribes of Albania were solicited to descend from their mountains and two of the most powerful governors usurping the ensigns or the powers of royalty implored the assistance of Sapor and opened the gates of their cities to the Persian garrisons The Christian party under the guidance of the archbishop of Artaxata the immediate successor of St Gregory the Illuminator had recourse to the piety of Constantius After the troubles had continued about three years Antiochus one of the officers of the household executed with success the Imperial commission of restoring Chosroes the son of Tiridates to the throne of his fathers of distributing honours and rewards among the faithful servants of the house of Arsaces and of proclaiming a general amnesty which was accepted by the greater part of the rebellious Satraps But the Romans derived more honour than advantage from this revolution Chosroes was a prince of a puny stature and a pusillanimous spirit Unequal to the fatigues of war averse to the society of mankind he withdrew from his capital to a retired palace which he built on the banks of the river Eleutherus and in the centre of a shady grove where he consumed his vacant hours in the rural sports of hunting and hawking To secure this inglorious ease he submitted to the conditions of peace which Sapor condescended to impose the payment of an annual tribute and the restitution of the fertile province of Atropatene which the  courage of Tiridates and the victorious arms of Galerius had annexed to the

from the adventures of Malchus which Jerom has related in so entertaining a manner that the high road between Beraea and Edessa was infested by these robbers See Hieronym tom i p  The more grave and important operations of the war were conducted with equal vigour and the armies of Rome and Persia encountered each other in nine bloody fields in two of which Constantius himself commanded in person  We shall take from Eutropius the general idea of the war x A Persis enim multa et gravia perpessus saepe captis oppidis obsessis urbibus caesis exercitibus nullumque ei contra Saporem prosperum praelium fuit nisi quod apud Singaram c This honest account is confirmed by the hints of Ammianus Rufus and Jerom The two first orations of Julian and the third oration of Libanius exhibit a more flattering picture but the recantation of both those orators after the death of Constantius while it restores us to the possession of the truth degrades their own character and that of the emperor The commentary of Spanheim on the first oration of Julian is profusely learned See likewise the judicious observations of Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p  The event of  Battle of Singara A D  the day was most commonly adverse to the Romans but in the battle of Singara their imprudent valour had almost atchieved a signal and decisive victory The stationary troops of Singara retired on the approach of Sapor who passed the Tigris over three bridges and occupied near the village of Hilleh an advantageous camp which by the labour of his numerous pioneers he surrounded in one day with a deep ditch and a lofty rampart His formidable host when it was drawn out in order of battle covered the banks of the river the adjacent heights and the whole extent of a plain of above twelve miles which separated the two armies Both were alike impatient to engage but the Barbarians after a slight resistance fled in disorder unable to resist or desirous to weary the strength of the heavy legions who fainting with heat and thirst pursued them across the plain and cut in pieces a line of cavalry clothed in complete armour which had been posted before the gates of the camp to protect their retreat Constantius who was hurried along in the pursuit attempted without effect to restrain the ardour of his troops by representing to them the dangers of the approaching night  and the certainty of completing their success with the return of day As they depended much more on their own valour than on the experience or the abilities of their chief they silenced by their clamours his timid remonstrances and rushing with fury to the charge filled up the ditch broke down the rampart and dispersed themselves through the tents to recruit their exhausted strength and to enjoy the rich harvest of their labours But the prudent Sapor had watched the moment of victory His army of which the greater part securely posted on the heights had been spectators of the action advanced in silence and under the shadow of the night and his Persian archers guided by the illumination of the camp poured a shower of arrows on a disarmed and licentious crowd The sincerity of history  Acerrimâ nocturnâ concertatione pugnatum est nostrorum copiis ingenti strage confossis Ammian xviii See likewise Eutropius x and S Rufus c  declares that the Romans were vanquished with a dreadful slaughter and that the flying remnant of the legions was exposed to the most intolerable hardships Even the tenderness of panegyric confessing that the glory of the emperor was sullied by the disobedience of his soldiers chuses to draw a veil over the circumstances of this melancholy retreat Yet one of those venal orators so jealous of the fame of Constantius relates with amazing coolness an act of such incredible cruelty as in the judgment of posterity must imprint a far deeper stain on the honour of the Imperial name The son of Sapor the heir of his crown  had been made a captive in the Persian camp The unhappy youth who might have excited the compassion of the most savage enemy was scourged tortured and publicly executed by the inhuman Romans  Libanius Orat iii p with Julian Orat i p and Spanheim's Commentary p    Whatever advantages might attend the arms of  Siege of Nisibis  Sapor in the field though nine repeated victories diffused among the nations the fame of his valour and conduct he could not hope to succeed in the execution of his designs while the fortified towns of Mesopotamia and above all the strong and antient city of Nisibis remained in the possession of the Romans In the space of twelve years Nisibis which since the time of Lucullus had been deservedly esteemed the bulwark of the east sustained three memorable sieges against the power  A D  of Sapor and the disappointed monarch after urging his attacks above sixty eighty and an hundred days was thrice repulsed with loss and ignominy  See Julian Orat i p Orat ii p c with the Commentary of Spanheim p who illustrates the circumstances and ascertains the time of the three sieges of Nisibis Their dates are likewise examined by Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p Something is added from Zosimus l iii p and the Alexandrian Chronicle p  This large and populous city was situate about two days journey from the Tigris in the midst of a pleasant and fertile plain at the foot of mount Masius A treble inclosure of brick walls was defended by a deep ditch  Sallust Fragment lxxxiv edit Brosses and Plutarch in Lucull tom iii p Nisibis is now reduced to one hundred and fifty houses the marshy lands produce rice and the fertile meadows as far as Mosul and the Tigris are covered with the ruins of towns and villages See Niebuhr Voyages tom ii p  and  the intrepid resistance of Count Lucilianus and his garrison was seconded by the desperate courage of the people The citizens of Nisibis were animated by the exhortations of their bishop  The miracles which Theodoret l ii c ascribes to St James bishop of Edessa were at least performed in a worthy cause the defence of his country He appeared on the walls under the figure of the Roman emperor and sent an army of gnats to sting the trunks of the elephants and to discomfit the host of the new Senacherib  inured to arms by the presence of danger and convinced of the intentions of Sapor to plant a Persian colony in their room and to lead them away into distant and barbarous captivity The event of the two former sieges elated their confidence and exasperated the haughty spirit of the Great King who advanced a third time towards Nisibis at the head of the united forces of Persia and India The ordinary machines invented to batter or undermine the walls were rendered ineffectual by the superior skill of the Romans and many days had vainly elapsed when Sapor embraced a resolution worthy of an eastern monarch who believed that the elements themselves were subject to his power At the stated season of the melting of the snows in Armenia the river Mygdonius which divides the plain and the city of Nisibis forms like the Nile  Julian Orat i p Though Niebuhr tom ii p allows a very considerable swell to the Mygdonius over which he saw a bridge of  twelve  arches it is difficult however to understand this parallel of a trifling rivulet with a mighty river There are many circumstances obscure and almost unintelligible in the description of these stupendous waterworks  an innundation  over the adjacent country By the labour of the Persians the course of the river was stopped below the town and the waters were confined on every side by solid mounds of earth On this artificial lake a fleet of armed vessels filled with soldiers and with engines which discharged stones of five hundred pounds weight advanced in order of battle and engaged almost upon a level the troops which defended the ramparts The irresistible force of the waters was alternately fatal to the contending parties till at length a portion of the walls unable to sustain the accumulated pressure gave way at once and exposed an ample breach of one hundred and fifty feet The Persians were instantly driven to the assault and the fate of Nisibis depended on the event of the day The heavyarmed cavalry who led the van of a deep column were embarrassed in the mud and great numbers were drowned in the unseen holes which had been filled by the rushing waters The elephants made furious by their wounds encreased the disorder and trampled down thousands of the Persian archers The Great King who from an exalted throne beheld the misfortunes of his arms sounded with reluctant indignation the signal of the retreat and suspended for some hours the prosecution of the attack But the vigilant citizens improved the opportunity of the night and the return of day discovered a new wall of six feet in height rising every moment to fill up the interval of the breach Notwithstanding the disappointment of his hopes and the loss of more than twenty thousand men Sapor still pressed the  reduction of Nisibis with an obstinate firmness which could have yielded only to the necessity of defending the eastern provinces of Persia against a formidable invasion of the Massagetae  We are obliged to Zonaras tom ii l xiii p for this invasion of the Massagetae which is perfectly consistent with the general series of events to which we are darkly led by the broken history of Ammianus  Alarmed by this intelligence he hastily relinquished the siege and marched with rapid diligence from the banks of the Tigris to those of the Oxus The danger and difficulties of the Scythian war engaged him soon afterwards to conclude or at least to observe a truce with the Roman emperor which was equally grateful to both princes as Constantius himself after the deaths of his two brothers was involved by the revolutions of the west in a civil contest which required and seemed to exceed the most vigorous exertion of his undivided strength  After the partition of the empire three years  Civil war and death of Constantine  had scarcely elapsed before the sons of Constantine seemed impatient to convince mankind that they were incapable of contenting themselves  A D March  with the dominions which they were unqualified to govern The eldest of those princes soon complained that he was defrauded of his just proportion of the spoils of their murdered kinsmen and though he might yield to the superior guilt and merit of Constantius he exacted from Constans the cession of the African provinces as an equivalent for the rich countries of Macedonia and Greece which his brother had acquired  by the death of Dalmatius The want of sincerity which Constantine experienced in a tedious and fruitless negociation exasperated the fierceness of his temper and he eagerly listened to those favourites who suggested to him that his honour as well as his interest was concerned in the prosecution of the quarrel At the head of a tumultuary band suited for rapine rather than for conquest he suddenly broke into the dominions of Constans by the way of the Julian Alps and the country round Aquileia felt the first effects of his resentment The measures of Constans who then resided in Dacia were directed with more prudence and ability On the news of his brother's invasion he detached a select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops proposing to follow them in person with the remainder of his forces But the conduct of his lieutenants soon terminated the unnatural contest By the artful appearances of flight Constantine was betrayed into an ambuscade which had been concealed in a wood where the rash youth with a few attendants was surprised surrounded and slain His body after it had been found in the obscure stream of the Alsa obtained the honours of an Imperial sepulchre but his provinces transferred their allegiance to the conqueror who refusing to admit his elder brother Constantius to any share in these new acquisitions maintained the undisputed possession of more than twothirds of the Roman empire  The causes and the events of this civil war are related with much perplexity and contradiction I have chiefly followed Zonaras and the younger Victor The monody ad calcem Eutrop edit Havercamp pronounced on the death of Constantine might have been very instructive but prudence and false taste engaged the orator to involve himself in vague declamation    The fate of Constans himself was delayed about ten years longer and the revenge of his brother's death was reserved for the more ignoble hand of  Murder of Constans  a domestic traitor The pernicious tendency of  A D February  the system introduced by Constantine was displayed in the feeble administration of his sons who by their vices and weakness soon lost the esteem and affections of their people The pride assumed by Constans from the unmerited success of his arms was rendered more contemptible by his want of abilities and application His fond partiality towards some German captives distinguished only by the charms of youth was an object of scandal to the people  Quarum  gentium  obsides pretio quaesitos pueros venustiores quod cultius habuerat libidine hujusmodi arsisse  pro certo  habetur Had not the depraved taste of Constans been publicly avowed the elder Victor who held a considerable office in his brother's reign would not have asserted it in such positive terms  and Magnentius an ambitious soldier who was himself of Barbarian extraction was encouraged by the public discontent to assert the honour of the Roman name  Julian Orat i and ii Zosim l ii p Victor in Epitome There is reason to believe that Magnentius was born in one of those Barbarian colonies which Constantius Chlorus had established in Gaul See this History vol ii p His behaviour may remind us of the patriot earl of Leicester the famous Simon de Montfort who could persuade the good people of England that he a Frenchman by birth had taken arms to deliver them from foreign favourites  The chosen bands of Jovians and Herculians who acknowledged Magnentius as their leader maintained the most respectable and important  station in the Imperial camp The friendship of Marcellinus count of the sacred largesses supplied with a liberal hand the means of seduction The soldiers were convinced by the most specious arguments that the republic summoned them to break the bonds of hereditary servitude and by the choice of an active and vigilant prince to reward the same virtues which had raised the ancestors of the degenerate Constans from a private condition to the throne of the world As soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution Marcellinus under the pretence of celebrating his son's birthday gave a splendid entertainment to the  illustrious  and  honourable  persons of the court of Gaul which then resided in the city of Autun The intemperance of the feast was artfully protracted till a very late hour of the night and the unsuspecting guests were tempted to indulge themselves in a dangerous and guilty freedom of conversation On a sudden the doors were thrown open and Magnentius who had retired for a few moments returned into the apartment invested with the diadem and purple The conspirators instantly saluted him with the titles of Augustus and Emperor The surprise the terror the intoxication the ambitious hopes and the mutual ignorance of the rest of the assembly prompted them to join their voices to the general acclamation The guards hastened to take the oath of fidelity the gates of the town were shut and before the dawn of day Magnentius became master of the troops and treasure of the palace and city of Autun By his secrecy and diligence he  entertained some hopes of surprising the person of Constans who was pursuing in the adjacent forest his favourite amusement of hunting or perhaps some pleasures of a more private and criminal nature The rapid progress of fame allowed him however an instant for flight though the desertion of his soldiers and subjects deprived him of the power of resistance Before he could reach a seaport in Spain where he intended to embark he was overtaken near Helena  This ancient city had once flourished under the name of Illiberis Pomponius Mela ii The munificence of Constantine gave it new splendor and his mother's name Helena it is still called Elne became the seat of a bishop who long afterwards transferred his residence to Perpignan the capital of modern Rousillon See d'Anville Notice de l'Ancienne Gaule p Longuerue Description de la France p and the Marca Hispanica l i c  at the foot of the Pyrenees by a party of light cavalry whose chief regardless of the sanctity of a temple executed his commission by the murder of the son of Constantine  Zosimus l ii p Zonaras tom ii l xiii p and the Abbreviators    As soon as the death of Constans had decided  Magnentius and Vetranio assume the purple  this easy but important revolution the example of the court of Autun was imitated by the provinces of the west The authority of Magnentius was  A D March  acknowledged through the whole extent of the two great praefectures of Gaul and Italy and the usurper prepared by every act of oppression to collect a treasure which might discharge the obligation of an immense donative and supply the expences of a civil war The martial countries  of Illyricum from the Danube to the extremity of Greece had long obeyed the government of Vetranio an aged general beloved for the simplicity of his manners and who had acquired some reputation by his experience and services in war  Eutropius x describes Vetranio with more temper and probably with more truth than either of the two Victors Vetranio was born of obscure parents in the wildest parts of Maesia and so much had his education been neglected that after his elevation he sludied the alphabet  Attached by habit by duty and by gratitude to the house of Constantine he immediately gave the strongest assurances to the only surviving son of his late master that he would expose with unshaken fidelity his person and his troops to inflict a just revenge on the traitors of Gaul But the legions of Vetranio were seduced rather than provoked by the example of rebellion their leader soon betrayed a want of firmness or a want of sincerity and his ambition derived a specious pretence from the approbation of the princess Constantina That cruel and aspiring woman who had obtained from the great Constantine her father the rank of  Augusta  placed the diadem with her own hands on the head of the Illyrian general and seemed to expect from his victory the accomplishment of those unbounded hopes of which she had been disappointed by the death of her husband Hannibalianus Perhaps it was without the consent of Constantina that the new emperor formed a necessary though dishonourable alliance with the usurper of the west  whose purple was so recently stained with her brother's blood  The doubtful fluctuating conduct of Vetranio is described by Julian in his first oration and accurately explained by Spanheim who discusses the situation and behaviour of Constantina    The intelligence of these important events  Constantius refuses to treat  which so deeply affected the honour and safety of the Imperial house recalled the arms of Constantius  A D  from the inglorious prosecution of the Persian war He recommended the care of the east to his lieutenants and afterwards to his cousin Gallus whom he raised from a prison to a throne and marched towards Europe with a mind agitated by the conflict of hope and fear of grief and indignation On his arrival at Heraclea in Thrace the emperor gave audience to the ambassadors of Magnentius and Vetranio The first author of the conspiracy Marcellinus who in some measure had bestowed the purple on his new master boldly accepted this dangerous commission and his three colleagues were selected from the illustrious personages of the state and army These deputies were instructed to soothe the resentment and to alarm the fears of Constantius They were empowered to offer him the friendship and alliance of the western princes to cement their union by a double marriage of Constantius with the daughter of Magnentius and of Magnentius himself with the ambitious Constantina and to acknowledge in the treaty the preeminence of rank which might justly be claimed by the emperor of the east Should pride and mistaken piety urge him to refuse these equitable  conditions the ambassadors were ordered to expatiate on the inevitable ruin which must attend his rashness if he ventured to provoke the sovereigns of the west to exert their superior strength and to employ against him that valour those abilities and those legions to which the house of Constantine had been indebted for so many triumphs Such propositions and such arguments appeared to deserve the most serious attention the answer of Constantius was deferred till the next day and as he had reflected on the importance of justifying a civil war in the opinion of the people he thus addressed his council who listened with real or affected credulity  Last night said he after I retired to rest the shade of the great Constantine embracing the corpse of my murdered brother rose before my eyes his wellknown voice awakened me to revenge forbade me to despair of the republic and assured me of the success and immortal glory which would crown the justice of my arms  The authority of such a vision or rather of the prince who alleged it silenced every doubt and excluded all negociation The ignominious terms of peace were rejected with disdain One of the ambassadors of the tyrant was dismissed with the haughty answer of Constantius his colleagues as unworthy of the privileges of the law of nations were put in irons and the contending powers prepared to wage an implacable war  See Peter the Patrician in the Excerpta Legationum p    Such was the conduct and such perhaps was the duty of the brother of Constans towards the perfidious usurper of Gaul The situation and  Deposes Vetranio  character of Vetranio admitted of milder measures  A D Dec  and the policy of the eastern emperor was directed to disunite his antagonists and to separate the forces of Illyricum from the cause of rebellion It was an easy task to deceive the frankness and simplicity of Vetranio who fluctuating some time between the opposite views of honour and interest displayed to the world the insincerity of his temper and was insensibly engaged in the snares of an artful negociation Constantius acknowledged him as a legitimate and equal colleague in the empire on condition that he would renounce his disgraceful alliance with Magnentius and appoint a place of interview on the frontiers of their respective provinces where they might pledge their friendship by mutual vows of fidelity and regulate by common consent the future operations of the civil war In consequence of this agreement Vetranio advanced to the city of Sardica  Zonaras tom ii l xiii p The position of Sardica near the modern city of Sophia appears better suited to this interview than the situation of either Naissus or Sirmium where it is placed by Jerom Socrates and Sozomen  at the head of twenty thousand horse and of a more numerous body of infantry a power so far superior to the forces of Constantius that the Illyrian emperor appeared to command the life and fortunes of his rival who depending on the success of his private negociations had seduced the troops and undermined  the throne of Vetranio The chiefs who had secretly embraced the party of Constantius prepared in his favour a public spectacle calculated to discover and inflame the passions of the multitude  See the two first orations of Julian particularly p and Zosimus l ii p The distinct narrative of the historian serves to illustrate the diffuse but vague descriptions of the orator  The united armies were commanded to assemble in a large plain near the city In the centre according to the rules of ancient discipline a military tribunal or rather scaffold was erected from whence the emperors were accustomed on solemn and important occasions to harangue the troops The wellordered ranks of Romans and Barbarians with drawn swords or with erected spears the squadrons of cavalry and the cohorts of infantry distinguished by the variety of their arms and ensigns formed an immense circle round the tribunal and the attentive silence which they preserved was sometimes interrupted by loud bursts of clamour or of applause In the presence of this formidable assembly the two emperors were called upon to explain the situation of public affairs the precedency of rank was yielded to the royal birth of Constantius and though he was indifferently skilled in the arts of rhetoric he acquitted himself under these difficult circumstances with firmness dexterity and eloquence The first part of his oration seemed to be pointed only against the tyrant of Gaul but while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of Constans he insinuated that none except a brother could claim a right to the succession  of his brother He displayed with some complacency the glories of his Imperial race and recalled to the memory of the troops the valour the triumphs the liberality of the great Constantine to whose sons they had engaged their allegiance by an oath of fidelity which the ingratitude of his most favoured servants had tempted them to violate The officers who surrounded the tribunal and were instructed to act their parts in this extraordinary scene confessed the irresistible power of reason and eloquence by saluting the emperor Constantius as their lawful sovereign The contagion of loyalty and repentance was communicated from rank to rank till the plain of Sardica resounded with the universal acclamation of  Away with these upstart usurpers Long life and victory to the son of Constantine Under his banners alone we will fight and conquer  The shout of thousands their menacing gestures the fierce clashing of their arms astonished and subdued the courage of Vetranio who stood amidst the defection of his followers in anxious and silent suspence Instead of embracing the last refuge of generous despair he tamely submitted to his fate and taking the diadem from his head in the view of both armies fell prostrate at the feet of his conqueror Constantius used his victory with prudence and moderation and raising from the ground the aged suppliant whom he affected to style by the endearing name of Father he gave him his hand to descend from the throne The city of Prusa was assigned for the exile or retirement of the abdicated  monarch who lived six years in the enjoyment of ease and affluence He often expressed his grateful sense of the goodness of Constantius and with a very amiable simplicity advised his benefactor to resign the sceptre of the world and to seek for content where alone it could be found in the peaceful obscurity of a private condition  The younger Victor assigns to his exile the emphatical appellation of "Voluptarium otium" Socrates l ii c is the voucher for the correspondence with the emperor which would seem to prove that Vetranio was indeed prope ad stultitiam simplicissimus    The behaviour of Constantius on this memorable  Makes war against Magnentius  occasion was celebrated with some appearance of justice and his courtiers compared the studied orations which a Pericles or a Demosthenes  A D  addressed to the populace of Athens with the victorious eloquence which had persuaded an armed multitude to desert and depose the object of their partial choice  Eum Constantius facundiae vi dejectum Imperio in privatum otium removit Quae gloria post natum Imperium soli processit eloquio clementiâque c Aurelius Victor Julian and Themistius Orat iii and iv adorn this exploit with all the artificial and gaudy colouring of their rhetorie  The approaching contest with Magnentius was of a more serious and bloody kind The tyrant advanced by rapid marches to encounter Constantius at the head of a numerous army composed of Gauls and Spaniards of Franks and Saxons of those provincials who supplied the strength of the legions and of those barbarians who were dreaded as the most formidable enemies of the republic The  fertile plains  Busbequius p traversed the Lower Hungary and Sclavonia at a time when they were reduced almost to a desert by the reciprocal hostilities of the Turks and Christians Yet he mentions with admiration the unconquerable fertility of the soil and observes that the height of the grass was sufficient to conceal a loaded waggon from his sight See likewise Browne's Travels in Harris's Collection vol ii p c  of the Lower Pannonia between the Drave the Save and the Danube presented a spacious theatre and the operations of the civil war were protracted during the summer months by the skill or timidity of the combatants  Zosimus gives a very large account of the war and the negociation l ii p But as he neither shews himself a soldier nor a politician his narrative must be weighed with attention and received with caution  Constantius had declared his intention of deciding the quarrel in the fields of Cibalis a name that would animate his troops by the remembrance of the victory which on the same auspicious ground had been obtained by the arms of his father Constantine Yet by the impregnable fortifications with which the emperor encompassed his camp he appeared to decline rather than to invite a general engagement It was the object of Magnentius to tempt or to compel his adversary to relinquish this advantageous position and he employed with that view the various marches evolutions and stratagems which the knowledge of the art of war could suggest to an experienced officer He carried by assault the important town of Siscia made an attack on the city of Sirmium which lay in the rear of the Imperial camp attempted to force a passage over the Save into the eastern provinces of  Illyricum and cut in pieces a numerous detachment which he had allured into the narrow passes of Adarne During the greater part of the summer the tyrant of Gaul shewed himself master of the field The troops of Constantius were harassed and dispirited his reputation declined in the eye of the world and his pride condescended to solicit a treaty of peace which would have resigned to the assassin of Constans the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps These offers were enforced by the eloquence of Philip the Imperial ambassador and the council as well as the army of Magnentius were disposed to accept them But the haughty usurper careless of the remonstrances of his friends gave orders that Philip should be detained as a captive or at least as a hostage while he dispatched an officer to reproach Constantius with the weakness of his reign and to insult him by the promise of a pardon if he would instantly abdicate the purple  That he should confide in the justice of his cause and the protection of an avenging Deity  was the only answer which honour permitted the emperor to return But he was so sensible of the difficulties of his situation that he no longer dared to retaliate the indignity which had been offered to his representative The negociation of Philip was not however ineffectual since he determined Sylvanus the Frank a general of merit and reputation to desert with a considerable body of cavalry a few days before the battle of Mursa  The city of Mursa or Essek celebrated in modern times for a bridge of boats five miles in length over the river Drave and the adjacent  Battle of Mursa  morasses  This remarkable bridge which is flanked with towers and supported on large wooden piles was constructed A D by Sultan Soliman to facilitate the march of his armies into Hungary See Browne's Travels and Busching's System of Geography vol ii p  has been always considered as a place  A D Sept  of importance in the wars of Hungary Magnentius directing his march towards Mursa set fire to the gates and by a sudden assault had almost scaled the walls of the town The vigilance of the garrison extinguished the flames the approach of Constantius left him no time to continue the operations of the siege and the emperor soon removed the only obstacle that could embarrass his motions by forcing a body of troops which had taken post in an adjoining amphitheatre The field of battle round Mursa was a naked and level plain on this ground the army of Constantius formed with the Drave on their right while their left either from the nature of their disposition or from the superiority of their cavalry extended far beyond the right slank of Magnentius  This position and the subsequent evolutions are clearly though concisely described by Julian Orat i p  The troops on both sides remained under arms in anxious expectation during the greatest part of the morning and the son of Constantine after animating his soldiers by an eloquent speech retired into a church at some distance from the field of battle and committed  to his generals the conduct of this decisive day  Sulpicius Severus l ii p The emperor passed the day in prayer with Valens the Arian bishop of Mursa who gained his confidence by announcing the success of the battle M de Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p very properly remarks the silence of Julian with regard to the personal prowess of Constantius in the battle of Mursa The silence of flattery is sometimes equal to the most positive and authentic evidence  They deserved his confidence by the valour and military skill which they exerted They wisely began the action upon the left and advancing their whole wing of cavalry in an oblique line they suddenly wheeled it on the right flank of the enemy which was unprepared to resist the impetuosity of their charge But the Romans of the West soon rallied by the habits of discipline and the Barbarians of Germany supported the renown of their national bravery The engagement soon became general was maintained with various and singular turns of fortune and scarcely ended with the darkness of the night The signal victory which Constantius obtained is attributed to the arms of his cavalry His cuirassiers are described as so many massy statues of steel glittering with their scaly armour and breaking with their ponderous lances the firm array of the Gallic legions As soon as the legions gave way the lighter and more active squadrons of the second line rode sword in hand into the intervals and completed the disorder In the mean while the huge bodies of the Germans were exposed almost naked to the dexterity of the oriental archers and whole troops of those barbarians were urged  by anguish and despair to precipitate themselves into the broad and rapid stream of the Drave  Julian Orat i p and Orat ii p Zonaras tom ii l xiii p Zosimus l ii p The last of these celebrates the dexterity of the archer Menelaus who could discharge three arrows at the same time an advantage which according to his apprehension of military affairs materially contributed to the victory of Constantius  The number of the slain was computed at fiftyfour thousand men and the slaughter of the conquerors was more considerable than that of the vanquished  According to Zonaras Constantius out of men lost and Magnentius lost out of The other articles of this account seem probable and authentic but the numbers of the tyrant's army must have been mistaken either by the author or his transcribers Magnentius had collected the whole force of the West Romans and Barbarians into one formidable body which cannot fairly be estimated at less than men Julian Orat i p  a circumstance which proves the obstinacy of the contest and justifies the observation of an ancient writer that the forces of the empire were consumed in the fatal battle of Mursa by the loss of a veteran army sufficient to defend the frontiers or to add new triumphs to the glory of Rome  Ingentes R I vires eâ dimicatione consumptae sunt ad quaelibet bella externa idoneae quae multum triumphorum possent securitatisque conferre Eutropius x The younger Victor expresses himself to the same effect  Notwithstanding the invectives of a servile orator there is not the least reason to believe that the tyrant deserted his own standard in the beginning of the engagement He seems to have displayed the virtues of a general and of a soldier till the day was irrecoverably lost and his camp in the possession of the enemy Magnentius then consulted his safety  and throwing away the Imperial ornaments escaped with some difficulty from the pursuit of the light horse who incessantly followed his rapid flight from the banks of the Drave to the foot of the Julian Alps  On this occasion we must prefer the unsuspected testimony of Zosimus and Zonaras to the flattering assertions of Julian The younger Victor paints the character of Magnentius in a singular light "Sermonis acer animi tumidi et immodicè timidus artifex tamen ad occultandam audaciae specie formidinem" Is it most likely that in the battle of Mursa his behaviour was governed by nature or by art I should incline for the latter    The approach of winter supplied the indolence  Conquest of Italy  of Constantius with specious reasons for deferring  A D  the prosecution of the war till the ensuing spring Magnentius had fixed his residence in the city of Aquileia and shewed a seeming resolution to dispute the passage of the mountains and morasses which fortified the confines of the Venetian province The surprisal of a castle in the Alps by the secret march of the Imperialists could scarcely have determined him to relinquish the possession of Italy if the inclinations of the people had supported the cause of their tyrant  Julian Orat i p In that place however as well as in Oration ii p he insinuates the general disposition of the senate the people and the soldiers of Italy towards the party of the emperor  But the memory of the cruelties exercised by his ministers after the unsuccessful revolt of Nepotian had left a deep impression of horror and resentment on the minds of the Romans That rash youth the son of the princess Eutropia and the nephew of Constantine had seen with indignation the sceptre of the West usurped by a perfidious barbarian  Arming a desperate troop of slaves and gladiators he overpowered the feeble guard of the domestic tranquillity of Rome received the homage of the senate and assuming the title of Augustus precariously reigned during a tumult of twentyeight days The march of some regular forces put an end to his ambitious hopes the rebellion was extinguished in the blood of Nepotian of his mother Eutropia and of his adherents and the proscription was extended to all who had contracted a fatal alliance with the name and family of Constantine  The elder Victor describes in a pathetic manner the miserable condition of Rome  Cujus stolidum ingenium adeo P R patribusque exitio fuit uti passim domus fora viae templaque cruore cadaveribusque opplerentur bustorum modo  Athanasius tom i p deplores the fate of several illustrious victims and Julian Orat ii p execrates the cruelty of Marcellinus the implacable enemy of the house of Constantine  But as soon as Constantius after the battle of Mursa became master of the seacoast of Dalmatia a band of noble exiles who had ventured to equip a fleet in some harbour of the Hadriatic sought protection and revenge in his victorious camp By their secret intelligence with their countrymen Rome and the Italian cities were persuaded to display the banners of Constantius on their walls The grateful veterans enriched by the liberality of

her gates against Decentius who had been raised by his brother to the rank either of Caesar or of Augustus  The medals of Magnentius celebrate the victories of the  two  Augusti and of the Caesar The Caesar was another brother named Desiderius See Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p  From Treves Decentius was obliged to retire to Sens where he was soon surrounded by an army of Germans whom the

pleasure of murdering with his own hands his mother and his brother Desiderius  a death more easy and more honourable than he could hope to obtain from the hands of an enemy whose revenge would have been coloured with the specious pretence of justice and fraternal piety The example of suicide was imitated by Decentius who strangled himself on the news of his brother's death The author of the conspiracy Marcellinus had long since disappeared in the battle of Mursa  Julian Orat i p seems at a loss to determine whether he inflicted on himself the punishment of his crimes whether he was drowned in the Drave or whether he was carried by the avenging daemons from the field of battle to his destined place of eternal tortures  and the public tranquillity was confirmed by the execution of

to wound the Imperial minister The most innocent subjects of the West were exposed to exile and confiscation to death and torture and as the timid are always cruel the mind of Constantius was

aversion and contempt which mankind has so uniformly entertained for that imperfect species appears to have degraded their character and to have rendered them almost as incapable as they were supposed to be of conceiving any generous sentiment or of performing any worthy action  Xenophon Cyropoedia l viii p has stated the specious reasons which engaged Cyrus to entrust his person to the guard of eunuchs He had observed in animals that although the practice of castration might tame their ungovernable fierceness it did not diminish their strength or spirit and he persuaded himself that those who were separated from the rest of human kind would be more firmly attached to the person of their benefactor But a long experience has contradicted the judgment of Cyrus Some particular instances may occur of eunuchs distinguished by their fidelity their valour and their abilities but if we examine the general history of Persia India and China we shall find that the power of the eunuchs has uniformly marked the decline and fall of every dynasty  But the eunuchs were  skilled in the arts of flattery and intrigue and they alternately governed the mind of Constantius by his fears his indolence and his vanity  See Ammianus Marcellinus l xxi c l xxii c The whole tenor of his impartial history serves to justify the invectives of Mamertinus of Libanius and of Julian himself who have insulted the vices of the court of Constantius  Whilst he viewed in a deceitful mirror the fair appearance of public prosperity he supinely permitted them to intercept the complaints of the injured provinces to accumulate immense treasures by the sale of justice and of honours to disgrace the most important dignities by the promotion of those who had purchased at their hands the powers of oppression  Aurelius Victor censures the negligence of his sovereign in chusing the governors of the provinces and the generals of the army and concludes his history with a very bold observation as it is much more dangerous under a feeble reign to attack the ministers than the master himself  Uti verum absolvam brevi ut Imperatore ipso clarius ita apparitorum plerisque magis atrox nihil  and to gratify their resentment against the few independent spirits who arrogantly refused to solicit the protection of slaves Of these slaves the most distinguished was the chamberlain Eusebius who ruled the monarch and the palace with such absolute sway that Constantius according to the sarcasm of an impartial historian possessed some credit with this haughty  favourite  Apud quem si verè dici debeat multum Constantius potuit Ammian l xviii c  By his artful suggestions the emperor was persuaded to subscribe the condemnation of the unfortunate Gallus and to add a new crime to the long list of unnatural murders which pollute the honour of the house of Constantine  When the two nephews of Constantine Gallus  Education of Gallus and Julian  and Julian were saved from the fury of the soldiers the former was about twelve and the latter about six years of age and as the eldest was thought to be of a sickly constitution they obtained with the less difficulty a precarious and dependent life from the affected pity of Constantius who was sensible that the execution of these helpless orphans would have been esteemed by all mankind an act of the most deliberate cruelty  Gregory Nazianzen Orat iii p reproaches the apostate with his ingratitude towards Mark bishop of Arethusa who had contributed to save his life and we learn though from a less respectable authority Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p that Julian was concealed in the sanctuary of a church  Different cities of Ionia and Bithynia were assigned for the places of their exile and education but as soon as their growing years excited the jealousy of the emperor he judged it more prudent to secure those unhappy youths in the strong castle of Macellum near Caesarea The treatment which they experienced during a six years confinement was partly such as they could hope from a careful guardian and partly such as they might dread from a suspicious tyrant  The most authentic account of the education and adventures of Julian is contained in the epistle or manifesto which he himself addressed to the senate and people of Athens Libanius Orat Parentalis on the side of the Pagans and Socrates l iii c on that of the Christians have preserved several interesting circumstances    Their prison was an ancient palace the residence of the kings of Cappadocia the situation was pleasant the buildings stately the inclosure spacious They pursued their studies and practised their exercises under the tuition of the most skilful masters and the numerous household appointed to attend or rather to guard the the nephews of Constantine was not unworthy of the dignity of their birth But they could not disguise to themselves that they were deprived of fortune of freedom and of safety secluded from the society of all whom they could trust or esteem and condemned to pass their melancholy hours in the company of slaves devoted to the commands of a tyrant who had already injured them beyond the hope of reconciliation At length however the emergencies of the state compelled the emperor or rather his eunuchs to invest Gallus in the twentyfifth year of his age with the title of Caesar and to cement this political  Gallus declared Caesar  connection by his marriage with the princess Constantina After a formal interview in which  A D March  the two princes mutually engaged their faith never to undertake any thing to the prejudice of each other they repaired without delay to their respective stations Constantius continued his march towards the West and Gallus fixed his residence  at Antioch from whence with a delegated authority he administered the five great dioceses of the eastern praefecture  For the promotion of Gallus see Idatius Zosimus and the two Victors According to Philostorgius l iv c Theophilus an Arian bishop was the witness and as it were the guarantee of this solemn engagement He supported that character with generous firmness but M de Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p thinks it very improbable that an heretic should have possessed such virtue  In this fortunate change the new Caesar was not unmindful of his brother Julian who obtained the honours of his rank the appearances of liberty and the restitution of an ample patrimony  Julian was at first permitted to pursue his studies at Constantinople but the reputation which he acquired soon excited the jealousy of Constantius and the young prince was advised to withdraw himself to the less conspicuous seenes of Bithynia and Ionia    The writers the most indulgent to the memory  Cruelty and imprudence of Gallus  of Gallus and even Julian himself though he wished to cast a veil over the frailties of his brother are obliged to confess that the Caesar was incapable of reigning Transported from a prison to a throne he possessed neither genius nor application nor docility to compensate for the want of knowledge and experience A temper naturally morose and violent instead of being corrected was soured by solitude and adversity the remembrance of what he had endured disposed him to retaliation rather than to sympathy and the ungoverned sallies of his rage were often fatal to those who approached his person or were subject to his power  See Julian ad S P Q A p Jerom in Chron Aurelius Victor Eutropius x I shall copy the words of Eutropius who wrote his abridgment about fifteen years after the death of Gallus when there was no longer any motive either to flatter or to depreciate his character  Multis incivilibus gestis Gallus Caesarvir naturâ ferox et ad tyrannidem pronior si suo jure imperate licuisset  Constantina his wife is  described not as a woman but as one of the infernal furies tormented with an insatiate thirst of human blood  Megaera quidem mortalis inflammatrix saevientis assidua humani cruoris avida c Ammian Marcellin l xiv c The sincerity of Ammianus would not suffer him to misrepresent facts or characters but his love of  ambitious  ornaments frequently betrayed him into an unnatural vehemence of expression  Instead of employing her influence to insinuate the mild counsels of prudence and humanity she exasperated the fierce passions of her husband and as she retained the vanity though she had renounced the gentleness of her sex a pearl necklace was esteemed an equivalent price for the murder of an innocent and virtuous nobleman  His name was Clematius of Alexandria and his only crime was a refusal to gratify the desires of his motherinlaw who solicited his death because she had been disappointed of his love Ammian l xiv c  The cruelty of Gallus was sometimes displayed in the undissembled violence of popular or military executions and was sometimes disguised by the abuse of law and the forms of judicial proceedings The private houses of Antioch and the places of public resort were besieged by spies and informers and the Caesar himself concealed in a plebeian habit very frequently condescended to assume that odious character Every apartment of the palace was adorned with the instruments of death and torture and a general consternation was diffused through the capital of Syria The Prince of the East as if he  had been conscious how much he had to fear and how little he deserved to reign selected for the objects of his resentment the provincials accused of some imaginary treason and his own courtiers whom with more reason he suspected of incensing by their secret correspondence the timid and suspicious mind of Constantius But he forgot that he was depriving himself of his only support the affection of the people whilst he furnished the malice of his enemies with the arms of truth and afforded the emperor the fairest pretence of exacting the forfeit of his purple and of his life  See in Ammianus l xiv c a very ample detail of the cruelties of Gallus His brother Julian p insinuates that a secret conspiracy had been formed against him and Zosimus names l ii p the persons engaged in it a minister of considerable rank and two obscure agents who were resolved to make their fortune    As long as the civil war suspended the fate of  Massacre of the Imperial ministers  the Roman world Constantius dissembled his knowledge of the weak and cruel administration to which his choice had subjected the East and  A D  the discovery of some assassins secretly dispatched to Antioch by the tyrant of Gaul was employed to convince the public that the emperor and Caesar were united by the same interest and pursued by the same enemies  Zonaras l xiii tom ii p The assassins had seduced a great number of legionaries but their designs were discovered and revealed by an old woman in whose cottage they lodged  But when the victory was decided in favour of Constantius his dependent colleague became less useful and less formidable Every circumstance of his conduct was severely and suspiciously examined and it was privately resolved either to deprive Gallus of the  purple or at least to remove him from the indolent luxury of Asia to the hardships and dangers of a German war The death of Theophilus consular of the province of Syria who in a time of scarcity had been massacred by the people of Antioch with the connivance and almost at the instigation of Gallus was justly resented not only as an act of wanton cruelty but as a dangerous insult on the supreme majesty of Constantius Two ministers of illustrious rank Domitian the Oriental praefect and Montius quaestor of the palace were empowered by a special commission to visit and reform the state of the East They were instructed to behave towards Gallus with moderation and respect and by the gentlest arts of persuasion to engage him to comply with the invitation of his brother and colleague The rashness of the praefect disappointed these prudent measures and hastened his own ruin as well as that of his enemy On his arrival at Antioch Domitian passed disdainfully before the gates of the palace and alleging a slight pretence of indisposition continued several days in sullen retirement to prepare an inflammatory memorial which he transmitted to the Imperial court Yielding at length to the pressing solicitations of Gallus the praefect condescended to take his seat in council but his first step was to signify a concise and haughty mandate importing that the Caesar should immediately repair to Italy and threatening that he himself would punish his delay or hesitation by suspending the usual allowance of his household The nephew and daughter  of Constantine who could ill brook the insolence of a subject expressed their resentment by instantly delivering Domitian to the custody of a guard The quarrel still admitted of some terms of accommodation They were rendered impracticable by the imprudent behaviour of Montius a statesman whose art and experience were frequently betrayed by the levity of his disposition  In the present text of Ammianus we read  Asper  quidem sed ad  lenitatem  propensior which forms a sentence of contradictory nonsense With the aid of an old manuscript Valesius has rectified the first of these corruptions and we perceive a ray of light in the substitution of the word  vafer  If we venture to change  lenitatem  into  levitatem  this alteration of a single letter will render the whole passage clear and consistent  The quaestor reproached Gallus in haughty language that a prince who was scarcely authorised to remove a municipal magistrate should presume to imprison a Praetorian praefect convoked a meeting of the civil and military officers and required them in the name of their sovereign to defend the person and dignity of his representatives By this rash declaration of war the impatient temper of Gallus was provoked to embrace the most desperate counsels He ordered his guards to stand to their arms assembled the populace of Antioch and recommended to their zeal the care of his safety and revenge His commands were too fatally obeyed They rudely seized the praefect and the quaestor and tying their legs together with ropes they dragged them through the streets of the city inflicted a thousand insults and a thousand wounds on these unhappy victims and at last precipitated their  mangled and lifeless bodies into the stream of the Orontes  Instead of being obliged to collect scattered and imperfect hints from various sources we now enter into the full stream of the history of Ammianus and need only refer to the seventh and ninth chapters of his fourteenth book Philostorgius however l iii c though partial to Gallus should not be entirely overlooked    After such a deed whatever might have been  Dangerous situation of Gallus  the designs of Gallus it was only in a field of battle that he could assert his innocence with any hope of success But the mind of that prince was formed of an equal mixture of violence and weakness Instead of assuming the title of Augustus instead of employing in his defence the troops and treasures of the East he suffered himself to be deceived by the affected tranquillity of Constantius who leaving him the vain pageantry of a court imperceptibly recalled the veteran legions from the provinces of Asia But as it still appeared dangerous to arrest Gallus in his capital the slow and safer arts of dissimulation were practised with success The frequent and pressing epistles of Constantius were filled with professions of confidence and friendship exhorting the Caesar to discharge the duties of his high station to relieve his colleague from a part of the public cares and to assist the West by his presence his counsels and his arms After so many reciprocal injuries Gallus had reason to fear and to distrust But he had neglected the opportunities of flight and of resistance he was seduced by the flattering assurances of the tribune Scudilo who under the semblance of a rough soldier disguised the  most artful insinuation and he depended on the credit of his wife Constantina till the unseasonable death of that princess completed the ruin in which he had been involved by her impetuous passions  She had preceded her husband but died of a fever on the road at a little place in Bithynia called Coenum Gallicanum    After a long delay the reluctant Caesar set forwards  His disgrace and death  on his journey to the Imperial court From Antioch to Hadrianople he traversed the wide  A D December  extent of his dominions with a numerous and stately train and as he laboured to conceal his apprehensions from the world and perhaps from himself he entertained the people of Constantinople with an exhibition of the games of the circus The progress of the journey might however have warned him of the impending danger In all the principal cities he was met by ministers of confidence commissioned to seize the offices of government to observe his motions and to prevent the hasty sallies of his despair The persons dispatched to secure the provinces which he left behind passed him with cold salutations or affected disdain and the troops whose station lay along the public road were studiously removed on his approach lest they might be tempted to offer their swords for the service of a civil war  The Thebaean legions which were then quartered at Hadrianople sent a deputation to Gallus with a tender of their services Ammian l xiv c The Notitia s edit Labb mentions three several legions which bore the name of Thebaean The zeal of M de Voltaire to destroy a despicable though celebrated legend has tempted him on the slightest grounds to deny the existence of a Thebaean legion in the Roman armies See Oeuvres de Voltaire tom xv p quarto edition    After Gallus had been permitted to repose himself a few days at Hadrianople he received a mandate expressed in the most haughty and absolute style that his splendid retinue should halt in that city while the Caesar himself with only ten postcarriages should hasten to the Imperial residence at Milan In this rapid journey the profound respect which was due to the brother and colleague of Constantius was insensibly changed into rude familiarity and Gallus who discovered in the countenances of the attendants that they already considered themselves as his guards and might soon be employed as his executioners began to accuse his fatal rashness and to recollect with terror and remorse the conduct by which he had provoked his fate The dissimulation which had hitherto been preserved was laid aside at Petovio in Pannonia He was conducted to a palace in the suburbs where the general Barbatio with a select band of soldiers who could neither be moved by pity nor corrupted by rewards expected the arrival of his illustrious victim In the close of the evening he was arrested ignominiously stripped of the ensigns of Caesar and hurried away to Pola in Istria a sequestered prison which had been so recently polluted with royal blood The horror which he felt was soon increased by the appearance of his implacable enemy the eunuch Eusebius who with the assistance of a notary and a tribune proceeded to interrogate him concerning the administration of the East The Caesar sunk under the weight of shame and guilt confessed all the criminal  actions and all the treasonable designs with which he was charged and by imputing them to the advice of his wife exasperated the indignation of Constantius who reviewed with partial prejudice the minutes of the examination The emperor was easily convinced that his own safety was incompatible with the life of his cousin the sentence of death was signed dispatched and executed and the nephew of Constantine with his hands tied behind his back was beheaded in prison like the vilest malefactor  See the complete narrative of the journey and death of Gallus in Ammianus l xiv c Julian complains that his brother was put to death without a trial attempts to justify or at least to excuse the cruel revenge which he had inflicted on his enemies but seems at last to acknowledge that he might justly have been deprived of the purple  Those who are inclined to palliate the cruelties of Constantius assert that he soon relented and endeavoured to recal the bloody mandate but that the second messenger entrusted with the reprieve was detained by the eunuchs who dreaded the unforgiving temper of Gallus and were desirous of reuniting to  their  empire the wealthy provinces of the East  Philostorgius l iv c Zonaras l xiii tom ii p But the former was partial towards an Arian monarch and the latter transcribed without choice or criticism whatever he found in the writings of the ancients    Besides the reigning emperor Julian alone  The danger and escape of Julian  survived of all the numerous posterity of Constantius Chlorus The misfortune of his royal birth involved him in the disgrace of Gallus From his retirement in the happy country of Ionia he was conveyed under a strong guard to  the court of Milan where he languished above seven months in the continual apprehension of suffering the same ignominious death which was daily inflicted almost before his eyes on the friends and adherents of his persecuted family His looks his gestures his silence were scrutinized with malignant curiosity and he was perpetually assaulted by enemies whom he had never offended and by arts to which he was a stranger  See Ammianus Marcellin l xv c Julian himself in his epistle to the Athenians draws a very lively and just picture of his own danger and of his sentiments He shews however a tendency to exaggerate his sufferings by insinuating though in obscure terms that they lasted above a year a period which cannot be reconciled with the truth of chronology  But in the school of adversity Julian insensibly acquired the virtues of firmness and discretion He defended his honour as well as his life against the ensnaring subtleties of the eunuchs who endeavoured to extort some declaration of his sentiments and whilst he cautiously suppressed his grief and resentment he nobly disdained to flatter the tyrant by any seeming approbation of his brother's murder Julian most devoutly ascribes his miraculous deliverance to the protection of the Gods who had exempted his innocence from the sentence of destruction pronounced by their justice against the impious house of Constantine  Julian has worked the crimes and misfortunes of the family of Constantine into an allegorical fable which is happily conceived and agreeably related It forms the conclusion of the seventh Oration from whence it has been detached and translated by the Abbé de la Bleterie Vie de Jovien tom ii p  As the most effectual instrument of their providence he gratefully  acknowledges the steady and generous friendship of the empress Eusebia  She was a native of Thessalonica in Macedonia of a noble family and the daughter as well as sister of consuls Her marriage with the emperor may be placed in the year In a divided age the historians of all parties agree in her praises See their testimonies collected by Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p  a woman of beauty and merit who by the ascendant which she had gained over the mind of her husband counterbalanced in some measure the powerful conspiracy of the eunuchs By the intercession of his patroness Julian was admitted into the Imperial presence he pleaded his cause with a decent freedom he was heard with favour and notwithstanding the efforts of his enemies who urged the danger of sparing an avenger of the blood of Gallus the milder sentiment of Eusebia prevailed in the council But the effects of a second interview were dreaded by the eunuchs and Julian was advised to withdraw for a while into the neighbourhood of Milan till the emperor thought  He is sent to Athens  proper to assign the city of Athens for the place  A D May  of his honourable exile As he had discovered from his earliest youth a propensity or rather passion for the language the manners the learning and the religion of the Greeks he obeyed with pleasure an order so agreeable to his wishes Far from the tumult of arms and the treachery of courts he spent six months amidst the groves of the academy in a free intercourse with the philosophers of the age who studied to cultivate the genius to encourage the vanity and to inflame the devotion of their royal pupil Their  labours were not unsuccessful and Julian inviolably preserved for Athens that tender regard which seldom fails to arise in a liberal mind from the recollection of the place where it has discovered and exercised its growing powers The gentleness and affability of manners which his temper suggested and his situation imposed insensibly engaged the affections of the strangers as well as citizens with whom he conversed Some of his fellowstudents might perhaps examine his behaviour with an eye of prejudice and aversion but Julian established in the schools of Athens a general prepossession in favour of his virtues and talents which was soon diffused over the Roman world  Libanius and Gregory Nazianzen have exhausted the arts as well as the powers of their eloquence to represent Julian as the first of heroes or the worst of tyrants Gregory was his fellowstudent at Athens and the symptoms which he so tragically describes of the future wickedness of the apostate amount only to some bodily imperfections and to some peculiarities in his speech and manner He protests however that he  then  foresaw and foretold the calamities of the church and state Greg Nazianzen Orat iv p    Whilst his hours were passed in studious retirement  Recalled to Milan  the empress resolute to atchieve the generous design which she had undertaken was not unmindful of the care of his fortune The death of the late Caesar had left Constantius invested with the sole command and oppressed by the accumulated weight of a mighty empire Before the wounds of civil discord could be healed the provinces of Gaul were overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians The Sarmatians no longer respected  the barrier of the Danube The impunity of rapine had increased the boldness and numbers of the wild Isaurians those robbers descended from their craggy mountains to ravage the adjacent country and had even presumed though without success to besiege the important city of Seleucia which was defended by a garrison of three Roman legions Above all the Persian monarch elated by victory again threatened the peace of Asia and the presence of the emperor was indispensably required both in the West and in the East For the first time Constantius sincerely acknowledged that his single strength was unequal to such an extent of care and of dominion  Succumbere tot necessitatibus tamque crebris unum se quod nunquam fecerat apertè demonstrans Ammian l xv c He then expresses in their own words the flattering assurances of the courtiers  Insensible to the voice of flattery which assured him that his allpowerful virtue and celestial fortune would still continue to triumph over every obstacle he listened with complacency to the advice of Eusebia which gratified his indolence without offending his suspicious pride As she perceived that the remembrance of Gallus dwelt on the emperor's mind she artfully turned his attention to the opposite characters of the two brothers which from their infancy had been compared to those of Domitian and of Titus  Tantum a temperatis moribus Juliani differens fratris quantum inter Vespasiani filios fuit Domitianum et Titum Ammian l xiv c The circumstances and education of the two brothers were so nearly the same as to afford a strong example of the innate difference of characters  She accustomed her husband to consider  Julian as a youth of a mild unambitious disposition whose allegiance and gratitude might be secured by the gift of the purple and who was qualified to fill with honour a subordinate station without aspiring to dispute the commands or to shade the glories of his sovereign and benefactor After an obstinate though secret struggle the opposition of the favourite eunuchs submitted to the ascendency of the empress and it was resolved that Julian after celebrating his nuptials with Helena sister of Constantius should be appointed with the title of Caesar to reign over the countries beyond the Alps  Ammianus l xv c Zosimus l iii p    Although the order which recalled him to court was probably accompanied by some intimation of his approaching greatness he appeals to the people of Athens to witness his tears of undissembled sorrow when he was reluctantly torn away from his beloved retirement  Julian ad S P Q A p Libanius Orat x p Julian did not yield till the Gods had signified their will by repeated visions and omens His piety then forbade him to resist  He trembled for his life for his fame and even for his virtue and his sole confidence was derived from the persuasion that Minerva inspired all his actions and that he was protected by an invisible guard of angels whom for that purpose she had borrowed from the Sun and Moon He approached with horror the palace of Milan nor could the ingenuous youth conceal his indignation when he found himself accosted with false and servile respect by the assassins of his family Eusebia rejoicing  in the success of her benevolent schemes embraced him with the tenderness of a sister and endeavoured by the most soothing caresses to dispel his terrors and reconcile him to his fortune But the ceremony of shaving his beard and his awkward demeanour when he first exchanged the cloak of a Greek philosopher for the military habit of a Roman prince amused during a few days the levity of the Imperial court  Julian himself relates p with some humour the circumstances of his own metamorphosis his downcast looks and his perplexity at being thus suddenly transported into a new world where every object appeared strange and hostile    The emperors of the age of Constantine no longer deigned to consult with the senate in the choice of a colleague but they were anxious that their nomination should be ratified by the consent of the army On this solemn occasion the guards with the other troops whose stations were in the neighbourhood of Milan appeared under arms and Constantius ascended his lofty tribunal holding by the hand his cousin Julian who entered the same day into the twentyfifth year of his age  See Ammian Marcellin l xv c Zosimus l iii p Aurelius Victor Victor Junior in Epitom Eutrop x  In a studied speech conceived and delivered with dignity the emperor represented the various dangers which threatened the prosperity of the republic the necessity of naming a Caesar for the administration of the West and his own intention if it was agreeable to their wishes of rewarding with the honours of the purple the promising virtues of the nephew of Constantine The approbation of the soldiers was  testified by a respectful murmur they gazed on the manly countenance of Julian and observed with pleasure that the fire which sparkled in his eyes was tempered by a modest blush on being thus exposed for the first time to the public view of mankind As soon as the ceremony of his investiture had been performed Constantius addressed him with the tone of authority which his superior age and station permitted him to assume and exhorting the new Caesar to deserve by heroic deeds that sacred and immortal name the emperor gave his colleague the strongest assurances of a friendship which should never be impaired by time nor interrupted by their separation into the most distant climates As soon as the speech was ended the troops as a token of applause clashed their shields against their knees  Militares omnes horrendo fragore scuta genibus illidentes quod est prosperitatis indicium plenum nam contra cum hastis clypei feriuntur irae documentum est et doloris Ammianus adds with a nice distinction Eumque ut potiori reverentia servaretur nec supra modum laudabant nec infra quam decebat  while the officers who surrounded the tribunal expressed with decent reserve their sense of the merits of the representative of Constantius  The two princes returned to the palace in the  and declared Caesar  same chariot and during the slow procession Julian repeated to himself a verse of his favourite  A D Nov  Homer which he might equally apply to his fortune and to his fears  The word  purple  which Homer had used as a vague but common epithet for death was applied by Julian to express very aptly the nature and object of his own apprehensions  The fourandtwenty  days which the Caesar spent at Milan after his investiture and the first months of his Gallic reign were devoted to a splendid but severe captivity nor could the acquisition of honour compensate for the loss of freedom  He represents in the most pathetic terms p the distress of his new situation The provision for his table was however so elegant and sumptuous that the young philosopher rejected it with disdain Quum legeret libellum assiduè quem Constantius ut privignum ad studia mittens manû suâ conscripserat praelicenter disponens quid in convivio Caesaris impendi deberet Phasianum et vulvam et sumen exigi vetuit et inferri Ammian Marcellin l xvi c  His steps were watched his correspondence was intercepted and he was obliged by prudence to decline the visits of his most intimate friends Of his former domestics four only were permitted to attend him two pages his physician and his librarian the last of whom was employed in the care of a valuable collection of books the gift of the empress who studied the inclinations as well as the interest of her friend In the room of these faithful servants an household was formed such indeed as became the dignity of a Caesar but it was filled with a crowd of slaves destitute and perhaps incapable of any attachment for their new master to whom for the most part they were either unknown or suspected His want of experience might require the assistance of a wise counsel but the minute instructions which regulated the service of his table and the distribution of his hours were adapted to a youth still under the discipline of his praeceptors rather than to the situation of a prince entrusted with the conduct of an important  war If he aspired to deserve the esteem of his subjects he was checked by the fear of displeasing his sovereign and even the fruits of his marriagebed were blasted by the jealous artifices of Eusebia  If we recollect that Constantine the father of Helena died above eighteen years before in a mature old age it will appear probable that the daughter though a virgin could not be very young at the time of her marriage She was soon afterwards delivered of a son who died immediately quòd obstetrix corrupta mercede mox natum praesecto plusquam convenerat umbilico necavit She accompanied the emperor and empress in their journey to Rome and the latter quaesitum venenum bibere per fraudem illexit ut quotiescunque concepisset immaturum abjiceret partum Ammian l xvi c Our physicians will determine whether there exists such a poison For my own part I am inclined to hope that the public malignity imputed the effects of accident as the guilt of Eusebia  herself who on this occasion alone seems to have been unmindful of the tenderness of her sex and the generosity of her character The memory of his father and of his brothers reminded Julian of his own danger and his apprehensions were encreased by the recent and unworthy fate of Sylvanus In the summer which  Fatal end of Sylvanus  preceded his own elevation that general had been chosen to deliver Gaul from the tyranny of the  A D September  Barbarians but Sylvanus soon discovered that he had left his most dangerous enemies in the Imperial court A dexterous informer countenanced by several of the principal ministers procured from him some recommendatory letters and erazing the whole of the contents except the signature filled up the vacant parchment with matters of high and treasonable import By the industry and courage of his friends the fraud was however detected and in a great council of the  civil and military officers held in the presence of the emperor himself the innocence of Sylvanus was publicly acknowledged But the discovery came too late the report of the calumny and the hasty seizure of his estate had already provoked the indignant chief to the rebellion of which he was so unjustly accused He assumed the purple at his headquarters of Cologne and his active powers appeared to menace Italy with an invasion and Milan with a siege In this emergency Ursicinus a general of equal rank regained by an act of treachery the favour which he had lost by his eminent services in the East Exasperated as he might speciously allege by injuries of a similar nature he hastened with a few followers to join the standard and to betray the confidence of his too credulous friend After a reign of only twentyeight days Sylvanus was assassinated the soldiers who without any criminal intention had blindly followed the example of their leader immediately returned to their allegiance and the flatterers of Constantius celebrated the wisdom and felicity of the monarch who had extinguished a civil war without the hazard of a battle  Ammianus xv was perfectly well informed of the conduct and fate of Sylvanus He himself was one of the few followers who attended Ursicinus in his dangerous enterprise    The protection of the Rhaetian frontier and  Constantius visits Rome  the persecution of the Catholic Church detained Constantius in Italy above eighteen months after  A D April  the departure of Julian Before the emperor returned into the East he indulged his pride and  curiosity in a visit to the ancient capital  For the particulars of the visit of Constantius to Rome see Ammianus l xvi c We have only to add that Themistius was appointed deputy from Constantinople and that he composed his fourth Oration for this ceremony  He proceeded from Milan to Rome along the Aemilian and Flaminian ways and as soon as he approached within forty miles of the city the march of a prince who had never vanquished a foreign enemy assumed the appearance of a triumphal procession His splendid train was composed of all the ministers of luxury but in a time of profound peace he was encompassed by the glittering arms of the numerous squadrons of his guards and cuirassiers Their streaming banners of silk embossed with gold and shaped in the form of dragons waved round the person of the emperor Constantius sat alone in a lofty car resplendent with gold and precious gems and except when he bowed his head to pass under the gates of the cities he affected a stately demeanour of inflexible and as it might seem of insensible gravity The severe discipline of the Persian youth had been introduced by the eunuchs into the Imperial palace and such were the habits of patience which they had inculcated that during a slow and sultry march he was never seen to move his hand towards his face or to turn his eyes either to the right or to the left He was received by the magistrates and senate of Rome and the emperor surveyed with attention the civil honours of the republic and the consular images of the noble families The streets were lined  with an innumerable multitude Their repeated acclamations expressed their joy at beholding after an absence of thirtytwo years the sacred person of their sovereign and Constantius himself expressed with some pleasantry his affected surprise that the human race should thus suddenly be collected on the same spot The son of Constantine was lodged in the ancient palace of Augustus he presided in the senate harangued the people from the tribunal which Cicero had so often ascended assisted with unusual courtesy at the games of the Circus and accepted the crowns of gold as well as the panegyrics which had been prepared for this ceremony by the deputies of the principal cities His short visit of thirty days was employed in viewing the monuments of art and power which were scattered over the seven hills and the interjacent vallies He admired the awful majesty of the capitol the vast extent of the baths of Caracalla and Diocletian the severe simplicity of the Pantheon the massy greatness of the amphitheatre of Titus the elegant architecture of the theatre of Pompey and the Temple of Peace and above all the stately structure of the Forum and column of Trajan acknowledging that the voice of fame so prone to invent and to magnify had made an inadequate report of the metropolis of the world The traveller who has contemplated the ruins of ancient Rome may conceive some imperfect idea of the sentiments which they must have inspired when they reared their heads in the splendour of unsullied beauty  The satisfaction which Constantius had received from this journey excited him to the generous emulation of bestowing on the Romans some memorial  A new obelisk  of his own gratitude and munificence His first idea was to imitate the equestrian and colossal statue which he had seen in the Forum of Trajan but when he had maturely weighed the difficulties of the execution  Hormisdas a fugitive prince of Persia observed to the emperor that if he made such a horse he must think of preparing a similar stable the Forum of Trajan Another saying of Hormisdas is recorded  that one thing only had  displeased  him to find that men died at Rome as well as elsewhere  If we adopt this reading of the text of Ammianus  displicuisse  instead of  placuisse  we may consider it as a reproof of Roman vanity The contrary sense would be that of a misanthrope  he chose rather to embellish the capital by the gift of an Egyptian obelisk In a remote but polished age which seems to have preceded the invention of alphabetical writing a great number of these obelisks had been erected in the cities of Thebes and Heliopolis by the ancient sovereigns of Egypt in a just confidence that the simplicity of their form and the hardness of their substance would resist the injuries of time and violence  When Germanicus visited the ancient monuments of Thebes the eldest of the priests explained to him the meaning of these hieroglyphics Tacit Annal ii c But it seems probable that before the useful invention of an alphabet these natural or arbitrary signs were the common characters of the Egyptian nation See Warburton's Divine Legation of Moses vol iii p  Several of these extraordinary columns had been transported to Rome by Augustus and his successors as the most durable monuments of their power and victory  See Plin Hist Natur l xxxvi c  but there remained one obelisk  which from its size or sanctity escaped for a long time the rapacious vanity of the conquerors It was designed by Constantine to adorn his new city  Ammian Marcellin l xvii c He gives us a Greek interpretation of the hieroglyphics and his commentator Lindenbrogius adds a Latin inscription which in twenty verses of the age of Constantius contain a short history of the obelisk  and after being removed by his order from the pedestal where it stood before the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis was floated down the Nile to Alexandria The death of Constantine suspended the execution of his purpose and this obelisk was destined by his son to the ancient capital of the empire A vessel of uncommon strength and capaciousness was provided to convey this enormous weight of granite at least an hundred and fifteen feet in length from the banks of the Nile to those of the Tyber The obelisk of Constantius was landed about three miles from the city and elevated by the efforts of art and labour in the great Circus of Rome  See Donat Roma Antiqua l iii c l iv c and the learned though confused Dissertation of Bargaeus on Obelisks inserted in the fourth volume of Graevius's Roman Antiquities p This Dissertation is dedicated to pope Sixtus V who erected the obelisk of Constantius in the square before the patriarchal church of St John Lateran    The departure of Constantius from Rome was  The Quadian and Sarmatian war  hastened by the alarming intelligence of the distress and danger of the Illyrian provinces The distractions of civil war and the irreparable  A D  loss which the Roman legions had sustained in the battle of Mursa exposed those countries almost without defence to the light cavalry of  the Barbarians and particularly to the inroads of the Quadi a fierce and powerful nation who seem to have exchanged the institutions of Germany for the arms and military arts of their Sarmatian allies  The events of this Quadian and Sarmatian war are related by Ammianus xvi xvii xix  The garrisons of the frontier were insufficient to check their progress and the indolent monarch was at length compelled to assemble from the extremities of his dominions the flower of the Palatine troops to take the field in person and to employ a whole campaign with the preceding autumn and the ensuing spring in the serious prosecution of the war The emperor passed the Danube on a bridge of boats cut in pieces all that encountered his march penetrated into the heart of the country of the Quadi and severely retaliated the calamities which they had inflicted on the Roman province The dismayed Barbarians were soon reduced to sue for peace they offered the restitution of his captive subjects as an atonement for the past and the noblest hostages as a pledge of their future conduct The generous courtesy which was shewn to the first among their chieftains who implored the clemency of Constantius encouraged the more timid or the more obstinate to imitate their example and the Imperial camp was crowded with the princes and ambassadors of the most distant tribes who occupied the plains of the Lesser Poland and who might have deemed themselves secure behind the lofty ridge of the Carpathian mountains While Constantius gave  laws to the Barbarians beyond the Danube he distinguished with specious compassion the Sarmatian exiles who had been expelled from their native country by the rebellion of their slaves and who formed a very considerable accession to the power of the Quadi The emperor embracing a generous but artful system of policy released the Sarmatians from the bands of this humiliating dependence and restored them by a separate treaty to the dignity of a nation united under the government of a king the friend and ally of the republic He declared his resolution of asserting the justice of their cause and of securing the peace of the provinces by the extirpation or at least the banishment of the Limigantes whose manners were still infected with the vices of their servile origin The execution of this design was attended with more difficulty than glory The territory of the Limigantes was protected against the Romans by the Danube against the hostile Barbarians by the Teyss The marshy lands which lay between those rivers and were often covered by their inundations formed an intricate wilderness pervious only to the inhabitants who were acquainted with its secret paths and inaccessible fortresses On the approach of Constantius the Limigantes tried the efficacy of prayers of fraud and of arms but he sternly rejected their supplications defeated their rude stratagems and repelled with skill and firmness the efforts of their irregular valour One of their most warlike tribes established in a small island towards the conflux of the Teyss and the  Danube consented to pass the river with the intention of surprising the emperor during the security of an amicable conference They soon became the victims of the perfidy which they meditated Encompassed on every side trampled down by the cavalry slaughtered by the swords of the legions they disdained to ask for mercy and with an undaunted countenance still grasped their weapons in the agonies of death After this victory a considerable body of Romans was landed on the opposite banks of the Danube the Taifalae a Gothic tribe engaged in the service of the empire invaded the Limigantes on the side of the Teyss and their former masters the free Sarmatians animated by hope and revenge penetrated through the hilly country into the heart of their ancient possessions A general conflagration revealed the huts of the Barbarians which were seated in the depth of the wilderness and the soldier fought with confidence on marshy ground which it was dangerous for him to tread In this extremity the bravest of the Limigantes were resolved to die in arms rather than to yield but the milder sentiment enforced by the authority of their elders at length prevailed and the suppliant crowd followed by their wives and children repaired to the Imperial camp to learn their fate from the mouth of the conqueror After celebrating his own clemency which was still inclined to pardon their repeated crimes and to spare the remnant of a guilty nation Constantius assigned for the place of their exile a remote country where they might enjoy a safe and  honourable repose The Limigantes obeyed with reluctance but before they could reach at least before they could occupy their destined habitations they returned to the banks of the Danube exaggerating the hardships of their situation and requesting with fervent professions of fidelity that the emperor would grant them an undisturbed settlement within the limits of the Roman provinces Instead of consulting his own experience of their incurable perfidy Constantius listened to his flatterers who were ready to represent the honour and advantage of accepting a colony of soldiers at a time when it was much easier to obtain the pecuniary contributions than the military service of the subjects of the empire The Limigantes were permitted to pass the Danube and the emperor gave audience to the multitude in a large plain near the modern city of Buda They surrounded the tribunal and seemed to hear with respect an oration full of mildness and dignity when one of the Barbarians casting his shoe into the air exclaimed with a loud voice  Marha Marha  a word of defiance which was received as the signal of the tumult They rushed with fury to seize the person of the emperor his royal throne and golden couch were pillaged by these rude hands but the faithful defence of his guards who died at his feet allowed him a moment to mount a fleet horse and to escape from the confusion The disgrace which had been incurred by a treacherous surprise was soon retrieved by the numbers and discipline of the Romans and the combat was only terminated  by the extinction of the name and nation of the Limigantes The free Sarmatians were reinstated in the possession of their ancient seats and although Constantius distrusted the levity of their character he entertained some hopes that a sense of gratitude might influence their future conduct He had remarked the lofty stature and obsequious demeanour of Zizais one of the noblest of their chiefs He conferred on him the title of King and Zizais proved that he was not unworthy to reign by a sincere and lasting attachment to the interest of his benefactor who after this splendid success received the name of  Sarmaticus  from the acclamations of his victorious army  Genti Sarmatarum magno decori considens apud eos regem dedit Aurelius Victor In a pompous oration pronounced by Constantius himself he expatiates on his own exploits with much vanity and some truth    While the Roman emperor and the Persian  The Persian negociation  monarch at the distance of three thousand miles defended their extreme limits against the Barbarians  A D  of the Danube and of the Oxus their intermediate frontier experienced the vicissitudes of a languid war and a precarious truce Two of the eastern ministers of Constantius the Praetorian praefect Musonian whose abilities were disgraced by the want of truth and integrity and Cassian duke of Mesopotamia a hardy and veteran soldier opened a secret negociation with the Satrap Tamsapor  Ammian xvi  These overtures of peace translated into the servile and flattering language of Asia were transmitted to the camp of the Great King who resolved to signify by an ambassador  the terms which he was inclined to grant to the suppliant Romans Narses whom he invested with that character was honourably received in his passage through Antioch and Constantinople he reached Sirmium after a long journey and at his first audience respectfully unsolded the silken veil which covered the haughty epistle of his sovereign Sapor King of Kings and Brother of the Sun and Moon such were the lofty titles affected by Oriental vanity expressed his satisfaction that his brother Constantius Caesar had been taught wisdom by adversity As the lawful successor of Darius Hystaspes Sapor asserted that the river Strymon in Macedonia was the true and ancient boundary of his empire declaring however that as an evidence of his moderation he would content himself with the provinces of Armenia and Mesopotamia which had been fraudulently extorted from his ancestors He alleged that without the restitution of these disputed countries it was impossible to establish any treaty on a solid and permanent basis and he arrogantly threatened that if his ambassador returned in vain he was prepared to take the field in the spring and to support the justice of his cause by the strength of his invincible arms Narses who was endowed with the most polite and amiable manners endeavoured as far as was consistent with his duty to soften the harshness of the message  Ammianus xvii transcribes the haughty letter Themistius Orat iv p edit Petav takes notice of the silk covering Idatius and Zonaras mention the journey of the ambassador and Peter the Patrician in Excerpt Legat p has informed us of his conciliating behaviour  Both the style  and substance were maturely weighed in the Imperial council and he was dismissed with the following answer  Constantius had a right to disclaim the officiousness of his ministers who had acted without any specific orders from the throne he was not however averse to an equal and honourable treaty but it was highly indecent as well as absurd to propose to the sole and victorious emperor of the Roman world the same conditions of peace which he had indignantly rejected at the time when his power was contracted within the narrow limits of the East the chance of arms was uncertain and Sapor should recollect that if the Romans had sometimes been vanquished in battle they had almost always been successful in the event of the war  A few days after the departure of Narses three ambassadors were sent to the court of Sapor who was already returned from the Scythian expedition to his ordinary residence of Ctesiphon A count a notary and a sophist had been selected for this important commission and Constantius who was secretly anxious for the conclusion of the peace entertained some hopes that the dignity of the first of these ministers the dexterity of the second and the rhetoric of the third  Ammianus xvii and Valesius ad loc The sophist or philosopher in that age these words were almost synonymous was Eustathius the Cappadocian the disciple of Jamblichus and the friend of St Basil Eunapius in Vit Aedesii p fondly attributes to this philosophic ambassador the glory of enchanting the Barbarian king by the persuasive charms of reason and eloquence See Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p  would persuade the Persian monarch  to abate of the rigour of his demands But the progress of their negociation was opposed and defeated by the hostile arts of Antoninus  Ammian xviii The decent and respectful behaviour of Antoninus towards the Roman general sets him in a very interesting light and Ammianus himself speaks of the traitor with some compassion and esteem  a Roman subject of Syria who had fled from oppression and was admitted into the councils of Sapor and even to the royal table where according to the custom of the Persians the most important business was frequently discussed  This circumstance as it is noticed by Ammianus serves to prove the veracity of Herodotus l i c and the permanency of the Persian manners In every age the Persians have been addicted to intemperance and the wines of Shiraz have triumphed over the law of Mahomet Brisson de Regno Pers l ii p and Chardin Voyages en Perse tom iii p  The dexterous fugitive promoted his interest by the same conduct which gratified his revenge He incessantly urged the ambition of his new master to embrace the favourable opportunity when the bravest of the Palatine troops were employed with the emperor in a distant war on the Danube He pressed Sapor to invade the exhausted and defenceless provinces of the East with the numerous armies of Persia now fortified by the alliance and accession of the fiercest Barbarians The ambassadors of Rome retired without success and a second embassy of a still more honourable rank was detained in strict confinement and threatened either with death or exile  The military historian  Ammian l xviii  who was himself dispatched to observe the army of the Persians as they were preparing to construct a bridge of boats  Invasion of Mesopotamia by Sapor  over the Tigris beheld from an eminence the plain of Assyria as far as the edge of the horizon  A D  covered with men with horses and with arms Sapor appeared in the front conspicuous by the splendor of his purple On his left hand the place of honour among the Orientals Grumbates king of the Chionites displayed the stern countenance of an aged and renowned warrior The monarch had reserved a similar place on his right hand for the king of the Albanians who led his independent tribes from the shores of the Caspian The fatraps and generals were distributed according to their several ranks and the whole army besides the numerous train of Oriental luxury consisted of more than one hundred thousand effective men inured to fatigue and selected from the bravest nations of Asia The Roman deserter who in some measure guided the councils of Sapor had prudently advised that instead of wasting the summer in tedious and difficult sieges he should march directly to the Euphrates and press forwards without delay to seize the feeble and wealthy metropolis of Syria But the Persians were no sooner advanced into the plains of Mesopotomia than they discovered that every precaution had been used which could retard their progress or defeat their design The inhabitants with their cattle were secured in  places of strength the green forage throughout the country was set on fire the fords of the river were fortified by sharp stakes military engines were planted on the opposite banks and a seasonable swell of the waters of the Euphrates deterred the Barbarians from attempting the ordinary passage of the bridge of Thapsacus Their skilful guide changing his plan of operations then conducted the army by a longer circuit but through a fertile territory towards the head of the Euphrates where the infant river is reduced to a shallow and accessible stream Sapor overlooked with prudent disdain the strength of Nisibis but as he passed under the walls of Amida he resolved to try whether the majesty of his presence would not awe the garrison into immediate submission The sacrilegious insult of a random dart which glanced against the royal tiara convinced him of his error and the indignant monarch listened with impatience to the advice of his ministers who conjured him not to sacrifice the success of his ambition to the gratification of his resentment The following day Grumbates advanced towards the gates with a select body of troops and required the instant surrender of the city as the only atonement which could be accepted for such an act of rashness and insolence His proposals were answered by a general discharge and his only son a beautiful and valiant youth was pierced through the heart by a javelin shot from one of the balistae The funeral of the prince of the Chionites was celebrated according to the rites of his country and the  grief of his aged father was alleviated by the solemn promise of Sapor that the guilty city of Amida should serve as a funeral pile to expiate the death and to perpetuate the memory of his son  The ancient city of Amid or Amida  For the description of Amida see d'Herbelot Bibliotheque Orientale p Histoire de Timur Bec par Chereseddin Ali l iii c Ahmed Arabsiades tom i p c Voyages de Tavernier tom i p Voyages d'Otter tom ii p and Voyages de Niebuhr tom ii p The last of these travellers a learned and accurate Dane has given a plan of Amida which illustrates the operations of the siege  which  Siege of Amida  sometimes assumes the provincial appellation of Diarbekir  Diarbekir which is stiled Amid or KaraAmid in the public writings of the Turks contains above houses and is the residence of a pasha with three tails The epithet of  Kara  is derived from the  blackness  of the stone which composes the strong and ancient wall of Amida  is advantageously situate in a fertile plain watered by the natural and artificial channels of the Tigris of which the least inconsiderable stream bends in a semicircular form round the eastern part of the city The emperor Constantius had recently conferred on Amida the honour of his own name and the additional fortifications of strong walls and lofty towers It was provided with an arsenal of military engines and the ordinary garrison had been reinforced to the amount of seven legions when the place was invested by the arms of Sapor  The operations of the siege of Amida are very minutely described by Ammianus xix who acted an honourable part in the defence and escaped with difficulty when the city was stormed by the Persians  His first and most sanguine hopes depended on the success of a general  assault To the several nations which followed his standard their respective posts were assigned the south to the Vertae the north to the Albanians the east to the Chionites inflamed with grief and indignation the west to the Segestans the bravest of his warriors who covered their front with a formidable line of Indian elephants  Of these four nations the Albanians are too well known to require any description The Segestans inhabited a large and level country which still preserves their name to the south of Khorasan and the west of Hindostan See Geographia Nubiensis p and d'Herbelot Bibliotheque Orientale p Notwithstanding the boasted victory of Bahram vol i p the Segestans above fourscore years afterwards appear as an independent nation the ally of Persia We are ignorant of the situation of the Vertae and Chionites but I am inclined to place them at least the latter towards the confines of India and Scythia See Ammian xvi  The Persians on every side supported their efforts and animated their courage and the monarch himself careless of his rank and safety displayed in the prosecution of the siege the ardor of a youthful soldier After an obstinate combat the Barbarians were repulsed they incessantly returned to the charge they were again driven back with a dreadful slaughter and two rebel legions of Gauls who had been banished into the East signalized their undisciplined courage by a nocturnal sally into the heart of the Persian camp In one of the fiercest of these repeated assaults Amida was betrayed by the treachery of a deserter who indicated to the Barbarians a secret and neglected staircase scooped out of the rock that hangs over the stream of the Tigris Seventy chosen archers of the royal guard ascended in silence to the third story of a lofty tower which  commanded the precipice they elevated on high the Persian banner the signal of confidence to the assailants and of dismay to the besieged and if this devoted band could have maintained their post a few minutes longer the reduction of the place might have been purchased by the sacrifice of their lives After Sapor had tried without success the efficacy of force and of stratagem he had recourse to the slower but more certain operations of a regular siege in the conduct of which he was instructed by the skill of the Roman deserters The trenches were opened at a convenient distance and the troops destined for that service advanced under the portable cover of strong hurdles to fill up the ditch and undermine the foundations of the walls Wooden towers were at the same time constructed and moved forwards on wheels till the soldiers who were provided with every species of missile weapons could engage almost on level ground with the troops who defended the rampart Every mode of resistance which art could suggest or courage could execute was employed in the defence of Amida and the works of Sapor were more than once destroyed by the fire of the Romans But the resources of a besieged city may be exhausted The Persians repaired their losses and pushed their approaches a large breach was made by the batteringram and the strength of the garrison wasted by the sword and by disease yielded to the fury of the assault The soldiers the citizens their wives their children all who  had not time to escape through the opposite gate were involved by the conquerors in a promiscuous massacre  But the ruin of Amida was the safety of the  Of Singara c  Roman provinces As soon as the first transports of victory had subsided Sapor was at leisure to  A D  reflect that to chastise a disobedient city he had lost the flower of his troops and the most favourable season for conquest  Ammianus has marked the chronology of this year by three signs which do not perfectly coincide with each other or with the series of the history The corn was ripe when Sapor invaded Mesopotamia "Cum jam stipulâ flavente turgerent" a circumstance which in the latitude of Aleppo would naturally refer us to the month of April or May See Harmer's Observations on Scripture vol i p Shaw's Travels p edit to The progress of Sapor was checked by the overflowing of the Euphrates which generally happens in July and August Plin Hist Nat v Viaggi di Pietro della Valle tom i p When Sapor had taken Amida after a siege of seventythree days the autumn was far advanced  Autumno precipiti haedoruinque improbo sidere extoto  To reconcile these apparent contradictions we must allow for some delay in the Persian king some inaccuracy in the historian and some disorder in the seasons  Thirty thousand of his veterans had fallen under the walls of Amida during the continuance of a siege which lasted seventythree days and the disappointed monarch returned to his capital with affected triumph and secret mortification It is more than probable that the inconstancy of his Barbarian allies was tempted to relinquish a war in which they had encountered such unexpected difficulties and that the aged king of the Chionites satiated with revenge turned away with horror from a scene of action where he had been deprived of the hope of his family and nation The strength as well as  spirit of the army with which Sapor took the field in the ensuing spring was no longer equal to the unbounded views of his ambition Instead of aspiring to the conquest of the East he was obliged to content himself with the reduction of two fortified cities of Mesopotamia Singara and Bezabde  The account of these sieges is given by Ammianus xx  the one situate in the midst of a sandy desert the other in a small peninsula surrounded almost on every side by the deep and rapid stream of the Tigris Five Roman legions of the diminutive size to which they had been reduced in the age of Constantine were made prisoners and sent into remote captivity on the extreme confines of Persia After dismantling the walls of Singara the conqueror abandoned that solitary and sequestered place but he carefully restored the fortifications of Bezabde and fixed in that important post a garrison or colony of veterans amply supplied with every means of defence and animated by high sentiments of honour and fidelity Towards the close of the campaign the arms of Sapor incurred some disgrace by an unsuccessful enterprize against Virtha or Tecrit a strong or as it was universally esteemed till the age of Tamerlane an impregnable fortress of the independent Arabs  For the identity of Virtha and Tecrit see d'Anville Geographie Ancienne tom ii p For the siege of that castle by Timur Bec or Tamerlane see Cherefeddin l iii c The Persian biographer exaggerates the merit and difficulty of this exploit which delivered the caravans of Bagdad from a formidable gang of robbers    The defence of the East against the arms of Sapor required and would have exercised the abilities of the most consummate general and it  Conduct of the Romans  seemed fortunate for the state that it was the actual province of the brave Ursicinus who alone deserved the confidence of the soldiers and people In the hour of danger Ursicinus  Ammianus xviii xix xx represents the merit and disgrace of Ursicinus with that faithful attention which a soldier owed to his general Some partiality may be suspected yet the whole account is consistent and probable  was removed from his station by the intrigues of the eunuchs and the military command of the East was bestowed by the same influence on Sabinian a wealthy and subtle veteran who had attained the infirmities without acquiring the experience of age By a second order which issued from the same jealous and inconstant counsels Ursicinus was again dispatched to the frontier of Mesopotamia and condemned to sustain the labours of a war the honours of which had been transferred to his unworthy rival Sabinian fixed his indolent station under the walls of Edessa and while he amused himself with the idle parade of military exercise and moved to the sound of flutes in the Pyrrhic dance the public defence was abandoned to the boldness and diligence of the former general of the East But whenever Ursicinus recommended any vigorous plan of operations when he proposed at the head of a light and active army to wheel round the foot of the mountains to intercept the convoys of the enemy to harass the wide extent of the Persian lines and to relieve  the distress of Amida the timid and envious commander alleged that he was restrained by his positive orders from endangering the safety of the troops Amida was at length taken its bravest defenders who had escaped the sword of the Barbarians died in the Roman camp by the hand of the executioner and Ursicinus himself after supporting the disgrace of a partial enquiry was punished for the misconduct of Sabinian by the loss of his military rank But Constantius soon experienced the truth of the prediction which honest indignation had extorted from his injured lieutenant that as long as such maxims of government were suffered to prevail the emperor himself would find it no easy task to defend his eastern dominions from the invasion of a foreign enemy When he had subdued or pacified the Barbarians of the Danube Constantius proceeded by slow marches into the East and after he had wept over the smoking ruins of Amida he formed with a powerful army the siege of Bezabde The walls were shaken by the reiterated efforts of the most enormous of the batteringrams the town was reduced to the last extremity but it was still defended by the patient and intrepid valour of the garrison till the approach of the rainy season obliged the emperor to raise the siege and ingloriously to retreat into his winterquarters at Antioch  Ammian xx Omisso vano incepto hiematurus Antiochiae redit in Syriam aerumnosam perpessus et ulcerum sed et atrocia diuque deflenda It is  thus  that James Gronovius has restored an obscure passage and he thinks that this correction alone would have deserved a new edition of his author whose sense may now be darkly perceived I expected some additional light from the recent labours of the learned Ernestus Lipsiae  The pride of Constantius and the ingenuity  of his courtiers were at a loss to discover any materials for panegyric in the events of the Persian war while the glory of his cousin Julian to whose military command he had entrusted the provinces of Gaul was proclaimed to the world in the simple and concise narrative of his exploits  In the blind fury of civil discord Constantius  Invasion of Gaul by the Germans  had abandoned to the Barbarians of Germany the countries of Gaul which still acknowledged the authority of his rival A numerous swarm of Franks and Alemanni were invited to cross the Rhine by presents and promises by the hopes of spoil and by a perpetual grant of all the territories which they should be able to subdue  The ravages of the Germans and the distress of Gaul may be collected from Julian himself Orat ad S P Q Athen p Ammian xv Libanius Orat x Zosimus l iii p Sozomen l iii c  But the emperor who for a temporary service had thus imprudently provoked the rapacious spirit of the Barbarians soon discovered and lamented the difficulty of dismissing these formidable allies after they had tasted the richness of the Roman soil Regardless of the nice distinction of loyalty and rebellion these undisciplined robbers treated as their natural enemies all the subjects of the empire who possessed any property which they were desirous of acquiring Fortyfive flourishing cities Tongres Cologne Treves Worms Spires Strasburgh c besides a far greater number of  towns and villages were pillaged and for the most part reduced to ashes The Barbarians of Germany still faithful to the maxims of their ancestors abhorred the confinement of walls to which they applied the odious names of prisons and sepulchres and fixing their independent habitations on the banks of rivers the Rhine the Moselle and the Meuse they secured themselves against the danger of a surprise by a rude and hasty fortification of large trees which were felled and thrown across the roads The Alemanni were established in the modern countries of Alsace and Lorraine the Franks occupied the island of the Batavians together with an extensive district of Brabant which was then known by the appellation of Toxandria  Ammianus xvi This name seems to be derived from the Toxandri of Pliny and very frequently occurs in the histories of the middle age Toxandria was a country of woods and morasses which extended from the neighbourhood of Tongres to the conflux of the Vahal and the Rhine See Valesius Notit Galliar p  and may deserve to be considered as the original seat of their Gallic monarchy  The paradox of P Daniel that the Franks never obtained any permanent settlement on this side of the Rhine before the time of Clovis is refuted with much learning and good sense by M Biet who has proved by a chain of evidence their uninterrupted possession of Toxandria one hundred and thirty years before the accession of Clovis The Dissertation of M Biet was crowned by the Academy of Soissons in the year and seems to have been justly preferred to the discourse of his more celebrated competitor the Abbé le Boeuf an antiquarian whose name was happily expressive of his talents  From the sources to the mouth of the Rhine the conquests of the Germans extended above forty miles to the west of that river over a country peopled by colonies of their own  name and nation and the scene of their devastations was three times more extensive than that of their conquests At a still greater distance the open towns of Gaul were deserted and the inhabitants of the fortified cities who trusted to their strength and vigilance were obliged to content themselves with such supplies of corn as they could raise on the vacant land within the inclosure of their walls The diminished legions destitute of pay and provisions of arms and discipline trembled at the approach and even at the name of the Barbarians  Under these melancholy circumstances an unexperienced  Conduct of Julian  youth was appointed to save and to govern the provinces of Gaul or rather as he expresses it himself to exhibit the vain image of Imperial greatness The retired scholastic education of Julian in which he had been more conversant with books than with arms with the dead than with the living left him in profound ignorance of the practical arts of war and government and when he awkwardly repeated some military exercise which it was necessary for him to learn he exclaimed with a sigh  O Plato Plato what a task for a philosopher  Yet even this speculative philosophy which men of business are too apt to despise had filled the mind of Julian with the noblest precepts and the most shining examples had animated him with the love of virtue the desire of fame and the contempt of death The habits of temperance recommended in the schools are still more essential  in the severe discipline of a camp The simple wants of nature regulated the measure of his food and sleep Rejecting with disdain the delicacies provided for his table he satisfied his appetite with the coarse and common fare which was allotted to the meanest soldiers During the rigour of a Gallic winter he never suffered a fire in his bedchamber and after a short and interrupted slumber he frequently rose in the middle of the night from a carpet spread on the floor to dispatch any urgent business to visit his rounds or to steal a few moments for the prosecution of his favourite studies  The private life of Julian in Gaul and the severe discipline which he embraced are displayed by Ammianus xvi who professes to praise and by Julian himself who affects to ridicule Misopogon p a conduct which in a prince of the house of Constantine might justly excite the surprise of mankind  The precepts of eloquence which he had hitherto practised on fancied topics of declamation were more usefully applied to excite or to assuage the passions of an armed multitude and although Julian from his early habits of conversation and literature was more familiarly acquainted with the beauties of the Greek language he had attained a competent knowledge of the Latin tongue  Aderat Latine quoque disserenti sufficiens sermo Ammianus xvi But Julian educated in the schools of Greece always considered the language of the Romans as a foreign and popular dialect which he might use on necessary occasions  Since Julian was not originally designed for the character of a legislator or a judge it is probable that the civil jurisprudence of the Romans had not engaged any considerable share of his attention but he  derived from his philosophic studies an inflexible regard for justice tempered by a disposition to clemency the knowledge of the general principles of equity and evidence and the faculty of patiently investigating the most intricate and tedious questions which could be proposed for his discussion The measures of policy and the operations of war must submit to the various accidents of circumstance and character and the unpractised student will often be perplexed in the application of the most perfect theory But in the acquisition of this important science Julian was assisted by the active vigour of his own genius as well as by the wisdom and experience of Sallust an officer of rank who soon conceived a sincere attachment for a prince so worthy of his friendship and whose incorruptible integrity was adorned by the talent of insinuating the harshest truths without wounding the delicacy of a royal ear  We are ignorant of the actual office of this excellent minister whom Julian afterwards created praefect of Gaul Sallust was speedily recalled by the jealousy of the emperor and we may still read a sensible but pedantic discourse p in which Julian deplores the loss of so valuable a friend to whom he acknowledges himself indebted for his reputation See La Bleterie Preface à la Vie de Jovien p    Immediately after Julian had received the  His first campaign in Gaul  purple at Milan he was sent into Gaul with a feeble retinue of three hundred and sixty soldiers  A D  At Vienna where he passed a painful and anxious winter in the hands of those ministers to whom Constantius had entrusted the direction of his conduct the Caesar was informed of the siege and  deliverance of Autun That large and antient city protected only by a ruined wall and pusillanimous garrison was saved by the generous resolution of a few veterans who resumed their arms for the defence of their country In his march from Autun through the heart of the Gallic provinces Julian embraced with ardour the earliest opportunity of signalizing his courage At the head of a small body of archers and heavy cavalry he preferred the shorter but the more dangerous of two roads and sometimes eluding and sometimes resisting the attacks of the Barbarians who were masters of the field he arrived with honour and safety at the camp near Rheims where the Roman troops had been ordered to assemble The aspect of their young prince revived the drooping spirit of the soldiers and they marched from Rheims in search of the enemy with a confidence which had almost proved fatal to them The Alemanni familiarized to the knowledge of the country secretly collected their scattered forces and seizing the opportunity of a dark and rainy day poured with unexpected fury on the rearguard of the Romans Before the inevitable disorder could be remedied two legions were destroyed and Julian was taught by experience that caution and vigilance are the most important lessons of the art of war In a second and more successful action he recovered and established his military fame but as the agility of the Barbarians saved them from the pursuit his victory was neither bloody nor decisive He advanced however to the banks of the Rhine  surveyed the ruins of Cologne convinced himself of the difficulties of the war and retreated on the approach of winter discontented with the court with his army and with his own success  Ammianus xvi appears much better satisfied with the success of this first campaign than Julian himself who very fairly owns that he did nothing of consequence and that he fled before the enemy  The power of the enemy was yet unbroken and the Caesar had no sooner separated his troops and fixed his own quarters at Sens in the centre of Gaul than he was surrounded and besieged by a numerous host of Germans Reduced in this extremity to the resources of his own mind he displayed a prudent intrepidity which compensated for all the deficiencies of the place and garrison and the Barbarians at the end of thirty days were obliged to retire with disappointed rage  The conscious pride of Julian who was indebted  His second campaign  only to his sword for this signal deliverance was embittered by the reflection that he  A D  was abandoned betrayed and perhaps devoted to destruction by those who were bound to assist him by every tie of honour and fidelity Marcellus mastergeneral of the cavalry in Gaul interpreting too strictly the jealous orders of the court beheld with supine indifference the distress of Julian and had restrained the troops under his command from marching to the relief of Sens If the Caesar had dissembled in silence so dangerous an insult his person and authority would have been exposed to the contempt of the world and if an action so criminal had been suffered to pass  with impunity the emperor would have confirmed the suspicions which received a very specious colour from his past conduct towards the princes of the Flavian family Marcellus was recalled and gently dismissed from his office  Ammian xvi Libanius speaks rather more advantageously of the military talents of Marcellus Orat x p And Julian insinuates that he would not have been so easily recalled unless he had given other reasons of offence to the court p  In his room Severus was appointed general of the cavalry an experienced soldier of approved courage and fidelity who could advise with respect and execute with zeal and who submitted without reluctance to the supreme command which Julian by the interest of his patroness Eusebia at length obtained over the armies of Gaul  Severus non discors non arrogans sed longa militiae frugalitate compertus et eum recta praeeuntem secuturus ut ductorem morigerus miles Ammian xvi Zosimus l iii p  A very judicious plan of operations was adopted for the approaching campaign Julian himself at the head of the remains of the veteran bands and of some new levies which he had been permitted to form boldly penetrated into the centre of the German cantonments and carefully reestablished the fortifications of Saverne in an advantageous post which would either check the incursions or intercept the retreat of the enemy At the same time Barbatio general of the infantry advanced from Milan with an army of thirty thousand men and passing the mountains prepared to throw a bridge over the Rhine in the neighbourhood of Basil It was reasonable to expect that the Alemanni pressed on either side by the Roman arms  would soon be forced to evacuate the provinces of Gaul and to hasten to the defence of their native country But the hopes of the campaign were defeated by the incapacity or the envy or the secret instructions of Barbatio who acted as if he had been the enemy of the Caesar and the secret ally of the Barbarians The negligence with which he permitted a troop of pillagers freely to pass and to return almost before the gates of his camp may be imputed to his want of abilities but the treasonable act of burning a number of boats and a superfluous stock of provisions which would have been of the most essential service to the army of Gaul was an evidence of his hostile and criminal intentions The Germans despised an enemy who appeared destitute either of power or of inclination to offend them and the ignominious retreat of Barbatio deprived Julian of the expected support and left him to extricate himself from a hazardous situation where he could neither remain with safety nor retire with honour  On the design and failure of the cooperation between Julian and Barbatio see Ammianus xvi and Libanius Orat x p    As soon as they were delivered from the fears of invasion the Alemanni prepared to chastise the  Battle of Strasburgh  Roman youth who presumed to dispute the possession  A D August  of that country which they claimed as their own by the right of conquest and of treaties They employed three days and as many nights in transporting over the Rhine their military powers The fierce Chnodomar shaking the  ponderous javelin which he had victoriously wielded against the brother of Magnentius led the van of the Barbarians and moderated by his experience the martial ardour which his example inspired  Ammianus xvi describes with his inflated eloquence the figure and character of Chnodomar Audax et fidens ingenti robore lacertorum ubi ardor proelii sperabatur immanis equo spumante sublimior erectus in jaculum formidandae vastitatis armorumque nitore conspicuus antea strenuus et miles et utilis praeter caeteros ductor Decentium Caesarem superavit aequo marte congressus  He was followed by six other kings by ten princes of regal extraction by a long train of highspirited nobles and by thirtyfive thousand of the bravest warriors of the tribes of Germany The confidence derived from the view of their own strength was encreased by the intelligence which they received from a deserter that the Caesar with a feeble army of thirteen thousand men occupied a post about oneandtwenty miles from their camp of Strasburgh With this inadequate force Julian resolved to seek and to encounter the Barbarian host and the chance of a general action was preferred to the tedious and uncertain operation of separately engaging the dispersed parties of the Alemanni The Romans marched in close order and in two columns the cavalry on the right the infantry on the left and the day was so far spent when they appeared in sight of the enemy that Julian was desirous of deferring the battle till the next morning and of allowing his troops to recruit their exhausted strength by the necessary refreshments of sleep and food Yielding however with some reluctance  to the clamours of the soldiers and even to the opinion of his council he exhorted them to justify by their valour the eager impatience which in case of a defeat would be universally branded with the epithets of rashness and presumption The trumpets sounded the military shout was heard through the field and the two armies rushed with equal fury to the charge The Caesar who conducted in person his right wing depended on the dexterity of his archers and the weight of his cuirassiers But his ranks were instantly broken by an irregular mixture of lighthorse and of lightinfantry and he had the mortification of beholding the flight of six hundred of his most renowned cuirassiers  After the battle Julian ventured to revive the rigour of ancient discipline by exposing these fugitives in female apparel to the derision of the whole camp In the next campaign these troops nobly retrieved their honour Zosimus l iii p  The fugitives were stopped and rallied by the presence and authority of Julian who careless of his own safety threw himself before them and urging every motive of shame and honour led them back against the victorious enemy The conflict between the two lines of infantry was obstinate and bloody The Germans possessed the superiority of strength and stature the Romans that of discipline and temper and as the Barbarians who served under the standard of the empire united the respective advantages of both parties their strenuous efforts guided by a skilful leader at length determined the event of the day The Romans lost four tribunes and two hundred and fortythree soldiers  in this memorable battle of Strasburgh so glorious to the Caesar  Julian himself ad S P Q Athen p speaks of the battle of Strasburgh with the modesty of conscious merit  Zosimus compares it with the victory of Alexander over Darius and yet we are at a loss to discover any of those strokes of military genius which six the attention of ages on the conduct and success of a single day  and so salutary to the afflicted provinces of Gaul Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain in the field without including those who were drowned in the Rhine or transfixed with darts whilst they attempted to swim across the river  Ammianus xvi Libanius adds more to the number of the slain Orat x p But these trifling differences disappear before the Barbarians whom Zosimus has sacrificed to the glory of his hero l iii p We might attribute this extravagant number to the carelessness of transcribers if this credulous or partial historian had not swelled the army of Alemanni to an innumerable multitude of barbarians  It is our own fault if this detection does not inspire us with proper distrust on similar occasions  Chnodomar himself was surrounded and taken prisoner with three of his brave companions who had devoted themselves to follow in life or death the fate of their chieftain Julian received him with military pomp in the council of his officers and expressing a generous pity for the fallen state dissembled his inward contempt for the abject humiliation of his captive Instead of exhibiting the vanquished king of the Alemanni as a grateful spectacle to the cities of Gaul he respectfully laid at the feet of the emperor this splendid trophy of his victory Chnodomar experienced an honourable treatment but the impatient Barbarian could not long  survive his defeat his confinement and his exile  Ammian xvi Libanius Orat x p    After Julian had repulsed the Alemanni from  Julian subdues the Franks  the provinces of the Upper Rhine he turned his arms against the Franks who were seated nearer  A D  to the ocean on the confines of Gaul and Germany and who from their numbers and still more from their intrepid valour had ever been esteemed the most formidable of the Barbarians  Libanius Orat iii p draws a very lively picture of the manners of the Franks  Although they were strongly actuated by the allurements of rapine they professed a disinterested love of war which they considered as the supreme honour and felicity of human nature and their minds and bodies were so completely hardened by perpectual action that according to the lively expression of an orator the snows of winter were as pleasant to them as the flowers of spring In the month of December which followed the battle of Strasburg Julian attacked a body of six hundred Franks who had thrown themselves into two castles on the Meuse  Ammianus xvii Libanius Orat x p The Greek orator by misapprehending a passage of Julian has been induced to represent the Franks as consisting of a thousand men and as his head was always full of the Peloponnesian war he compares them to the Lacedaemonians who were besieged and taken in the island of Sphacteria  In the midst of that severe season they sustained with inflexible constancy a siege of fiftyfour days till at length exhausted by hunger and satisfied that the vigilance of the enemy in breaking the ice of the river left them no hopes of escape the  Franks consented for the first time to dispense with the ancient law which commanded them to conquer or to die The Caesar immediately sent his captives to the court of Constantius who accepting them as a valuable present  Julian ad S P Q Athen p Libanius Orat x p According to the expression of Libanius the emperor  which la Bleterie understands Vie de Julien p as an honest confession and Valesius ad Ammian xvii as a mean evasion of the truth Dom Bouquet Historiens de France tom i p by substituting another word  would suppress both the difficulty and the spirit of this passage  rejoiced in the opportunity of adding so many heroes to the choicest troops of his domestic guards The obstinate resistance of this handful of Franks apprised Julian of the difficulties of the expedition which he meditated for the ensuing spring against the whole body of the nation His rapid diligence surprised and astonished the active Barbarians Ordering his soldiers to provide themselves with biscuit for twenty days he suddenly pitched his camp near Tongres while the enemy still supposed him in his winterquarters of Paris expecting the slow arrival of his convoys from Aquitain Without allowing the Franks to unite or to deliberate he skilfully spread his legions from Cologne to the ocean and by the terror as well as by the success of his arms soon reduced the suppliant tribes to implore the clemency and to obey the commands of their conqueror The Chamavians submissively retired to their former habitations beyond the Rhine but the Salians were permitted to possess their new establishment of Toxandria as the subjects and  auxiliaries of the Roman empire  Ammian xvii Zosimus l iii p his narrative is darkened by a mixture of fable and Julian ad S P Q Athen p His expression  This difference of treatment confirms the opinion that the Salian Franks were permitted to retain the settlements in Toxandria  The treaty was ratified by solemn oaths and perpetual inspectors were appointed to reside among the Franks with the authority of enforcing the strict observance of the conditions An incident is related interesting enough in itself and by no means repugnant to the character of Julian who ingeniously contrived both the plot and the catastrophe of the tragedy When the Chamavians sued for peace he required the son of their king as the only hostage in whom he could rely A mournful silence interrupted by tears and groans declared the sad perplexity of the Barbarians and their aged chief lamented in pathetic language that his private loss was now embittered by a sense of the public calamity While the Chamavians lay prostrate at the foot of his throne the royal captive whom they believed to have been slain unexpectedly appeared before their eyes and as soon as the tumult of joy was hushed into attention the Caesar addressed the assembly in the following terms  Behold the son the prince whom you wept You had lost him by your fault God and the Romans have restored him to you I shall still preserve and educate the youth rather as a monument of my own virtue than as a pledge of your sincerity Should you presume to violate the  faith which you have sworn the arms of the republic will avenge the perfidy not on the innocent but on the guilty  The Barbarians withdrew from his presence impressed with the warmest sentiments of gratitude and admiration  This interesting story which Zosimus has abridged is related by Eunapius in Excerpt Legationum p with all the amplifications of Grecian rhetoric but the silence of Libanius of Ammianus and of Julian himself renders the truth of it extremely suspicious    It was not enough for Julian to have delivered  Makes three expeditions beyond the Rhine  the provinces of Gaul from the Barbarians of Germany He aspired to emulate the glory of the first and most illustrious of the emperors after  A D  whose example he composed his own commentaries of the Gallic war  Libanius the friend of Julian clearly insinuates Orat iv p that his hero had composed the history of his Gallic campaigns But Zosimus l iii p seems to have derived his information only from the Orations  and the Epistles of Julian The discourse which is addressed to the Athenians contains an accurate though general account of the war against the Germans  Caesar has related with conscious pride the manner in which he  twice  passed the Rhine Julian could boast that before he assumed the title of Augustus he had carried the Roman Eagles beyond that great river in  three  successful expeditions  See Ammian xvii xviii and Zosim l iii p Julian ad S P Q Athen p  The consternation of the Germans after the battle of Strasburgh encouraged him to the first attempt and the reluctance of the troops soon yielded to the persuasive eloquence of a leader who shared the fatigues and dangers which he imposed on the meanest of the soldiers The villages on either  side of the Meyn which were plentifully stored with corn and cattle felt the ravages of an invading army The principal houses constructed with some imitation of Roman elegance were consumed by the flames and the Caesar boldly advanced about ten miles till his progress was stopped by a dark and impenetrable forest undermined by subterraneous passages which threatened with secret snares and ambush every step of the assailant The ground was already covered with snow and Julian after repairing an ancient castle which had been erected by Trajan granted a truce of ten months to the submissive Barbarians At the expiration of the truce Julian undertook a second expedition beyond the Rhine to humble the pride of Surmar and Hortaire two of the kings of the Alemanni who had been present at the battle of Strasburgh They promised to restore all the Roman captives who yet remained alive and as the Caesar had procured an exact account from the cities and villages of Gaul of the inhabitants whom they had lost he detected every attempt to deceive him with a degree of readiness and accuracy which almost established the belief of his supernatural knowledge His third expedition was still more splendid and important than the two former The Germans had collected their military powers and moved along the opposite banks of the river with a design of destroying the bridge and of preventing the passage of the Romans But this judicious plan of defence was disconcerted by a skilful diversion Three hundred light armed and active soldiers  were detached in forty small boats to fall down the stream in silence and to land at some distance from the posts of the enemy They executed their orders with so much boldness and celerity that they had almost surprised the Barbarian chiefs who returned in the fearless confidence of intoxication from one of their nocturnal festivals Without repeating the uniform and disgusting tale of slaughter and devastation it is sufficient to observe that Julian dictated his own conditions of peace to six of the haughtiest kings of the Alemanni three of whom were permitted to view the severe discipline and martial pomp of a Roman camp Followed by twenty thousand captives whom he had rescued from the chains of the Barbarians the Caesar repassed the Rhine after terminating a war the success of which has been compared to the ancient glories of the Punic and Cimbric victories  As soon as the valour and conduct of Julian  Restores the cities of Gaul  had secured an interval of peace he applied himself to a work more congenial to his humane and philosophic temper The cities of Gaul which had suffered from the inroads of the Barbarians he diligently repaired and seven important posts between Mentz and the mouth of the Rhine are particularly mentioned as having been rebuilt and fortified by the order of Julian  Ammian xviii Libanius Orat x p Of these seven posts four are at present towns of some consequence Bingen Andernach Bonn and Nuyss The other three Tricesimae Quadriburgium and Castra Herculis or Heraclea no longer subsist but there is room to believe that on the ground of Quadriburgium the Dutch have constructed the fort of Schenk a name so offensive to the fastidious delicacy of Boileau See d'Anville Notice de l'ancienne Gaule p Boileau Epitre iv and the notes  The vanquished  Germans had submitted to the just but humiliating condition of preparing and conveying the necessary materials The active zeal of Julian urged the prosecution of the work and such was the spirit which he had diffused among the troops that the auxiliaries themselves waving their exemption from any duties of fatigue contended in the most servile labours with the diligence of the Roman soldiers It was incumbent on the Caesar to provide for the subsistence as well as for the safety of the inhabitants and of the garrisons The desertion of the former and the mutiny of the latter must have been the fatal and inevitable consequences of famine The tillage of the provinces of Gaul had been interrupted by the calamities of war but the scanty harvests of the continent were supplied by his paternal care from the plenty of the adjacent island Six hundred large barks framed in the forest of the Ardennes made several voyages to the coast of Britain and returning from thence laden with corn sailed up the Rhine and distributed their cargoes to the several towns and fortresses along the banks of the river  We may credit Julian himself Orat ad S P Q Atheniensem p who gives a very particular account of the transaction Zosimus adds two hundred vessels more l iii p If we compute the corn ships of Julian at only seventy tons each they were capable of exporting quarters See Arbuthnot's Weights and Measures p and the country which could bear so large an exportation must already have attained an improved state of agriculture  The arms of Julian had  restored a free and secure navigation which Constantius had offered to purchase at the expence of his dignity and of a tributary present of two thousand pounds of silver The emperor parsimoniously refused to his soldiers the sums which he granted with a lavish and trembling hand to the Barbarians The dexterity as well as the firmness of Julian was put to a severe trial when he took the field with a discontented army which had already served two campaigns without receiving any regular pay or any extraordinary donative  The troops once broke out into a mutiny immediately before the second passage of the Rhine Ammian xvii    A tender regard for the peace and happiness of  Civil administration of Julian  his subjects was the ruling principle which directed or seemed to direct the administration of Julian  Ammian xvi xviii Mamertinus in Panegyr Vet xi  He devoted the leisure of his winterquarters to the offices of civil government and affected to assume with more pleasure the character of a magistrate than that of a general Before he took the field he devolved on the provincial governors most of the public and private causes which had been referred to his tribunal but on his return he carefully revised their proceedings mitigated the rigour of the law and pronounced a second judgment on the judges themselves Superior to the last temptation of virtuous minds an indiscreet and intemperate zeal for justice he restrained with calmness and dignity the warmth of an advocate who prosecuted  for extortion the president of the Narbonnese province  Who will ever be found guilty exclaimed the vehement Delphidius if it be enough to deny  and who replied Julian will ever be innocent if it is sufficient to affirm  In the general administration of peace and war the interest of the sovereign is commonly the same as that of his people but Constantius would have thought himself deeply injured if the virtues of Julian had defrauded him of any part of the tribute which he extorted from an oppressed and exhausted country The prince who was invested with the ensigns of royalty might sometimes presume to correct the rapacious insolence of the inferior agents to expose their corrupt arts and to introduce an equal and easier mode of collection But the management of the finances was more safely entrusted to Florentius Praetorian praefect of Gaul an effeminate tyrant incapable of pity or remorse and the haughty minister complained of the most decent and gentle opposition while Julian himself was rather inclined to censure the weakness of his own behaviour The Caesar had rejected with abhorrence a mandate for the levy of an extraordinary tax a new superdiction which the praefect had offered for his signature and the faithful picture of the public misery by which he had been obliged to justify his refusal offended the court of Constantius We may enjoy the pleasure of reading the sentiments of Julian as he expresses them with warmth and freedom in a letter to one of his most intimate friends After stating  his own conduct he proceeds in the following terms  Was it possible for the disciple of Plato and Aristotle to act otherwise than I have done Could I abandon the unhappy subjects entrusted to my care Was I not called upon to defend them from the repeated injuries of these unfeeling robbers A tribune who deserts his post is punished with death and deprived of the honours of burial With what justice could I pronounce  his  sentence if in the hour of danger I myself neglected a duty far more sacred and far more important God has placed me in this elevated post his providence will guard and support me Should I be condemned to suffer I shall derive comfort from the testimony of a pure and upright conscience Would to heaven that I still possessed a counsellor like Sallust If they think proper to send me a successor I shall submit without reluctance and had much rather improve the short opportunity of doing good than enjoy a long and lasting impunity of evil  Ammian xvii Julian Epistol xv edit Spanheim Such a conduct almost justifies the encomium of Mamertinus Ita illi anni spatia divisa sunt ut aut Barbaros domitet aut civibus jura restituat perpetuum professus aut contra hostem aut contra vitia cortamen    The precarious and dependent situation of Julian displayed his virtues and concealed his defects The young hero who supported in Gaul the throne of Constantius was not permitted to reform the vices of the government but he had courage to alleviate or to pity the distress of the people Unless he had been able to revive the martial  spirit of the Romans or to introduce the arts of industry and refinement among their savage enemies he could not entertain any rational hopes of securing the public tranquillity either by the peace or conquest of Germany Yet the victories of Julian suspended for a short time the inroads of the Barbarians and delayed the ruin of the Western Empire  His salutary influence restored the cities of  Description of Paris  Gaul which had been so long exposed to the evils of civil discord Barbarian war and domestic tyranny and the spirit of industry was revived with the hopes of enjoyment Agriculture manufactures and commerce again flourished under the protection of the laws and the  curiae  or civil corporations were again filled with useful and respectable members the youth were no longer apprehensive of marriage and married persons were no longer apprehensive of posterity the public and private festivals were celebrated with customary pomp and the frequent and secure intercourse of the provinces displayed the image of national prosperity  Libanius Orat Parental in Imp Julian c in Fabricius Bibliothec Graec tom vii p  A mind like that of Julian must have felt the general happiness of which he was the author but he viewed with peculiar satisfaction and complacency the city of Paris the seat of his winter residence and the object even of his partial affection  See Julian in Misopogon p The primitive state of Paris is illustrated by Henry Valesius ad Ammian xx his brother Hadrian Valesius or de Valois and M d'Anville in their respective Notitias of ancient Gaul the Abbé de Longuerue Description de la France tom i p and M Bonamy in the Mem de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xv p  That splendid  capital which now embraces an ample territory on either side of the Seine was originally confined to the small island in the midst of the river from whence the inhabitants derived a supply of pure and salubrious water The river bathed the foot of the walls and the town was accessible only by two wooden bridges A forest overspread the northern side of the Seine but on the south the ground which now bears the name of the University was insensibly covered with houses and adorned with a palace and amphitheatre baths an aqueduct and a field of Mars for the exercise of the Roman troops The severity of the climate was tempered by the neighbourhood of the ocean and with some precautions which experience had taught the vine and figtree were successfully cultivated But in remarkable winters the Seine was deeply frozen and the huge pieces of ice that floated down the stream might be compared by an Asiatic to the blocks of white marble which were extracted from the quarries of Phrygia The licentiousness and corruption of Antioch recalled to the memory of Julian the severe and simple manners of his beloved Lutetia  Julian in Misopogon p Leucetia or Lutetia was the ancient name of the city which according to the fashion of the fourth century assumed the territorial appellation of  Parisii  where the amusements of the theatre were unknown or despised He indignantly contrasted the effeminate Syrians with the brave and honest simplicity of the Gauls and almost  forgave the intemperance which was the only stain of the Celtic character  Julian in Misopogon p  If Julian could now revisit the capital of France he might converse with men of science and genius capable of understanding and of instructing a disciple of the Greeks he might excuse the lively and graceful follies of a nation whose martial spirit has never been enervated by the indulgence of luxury and he must applaud the perfection of that inestimable art which softens and refines and embellishes the intercourse of social life  CHAP XX  The Motives Progress and Effects of the Conversion of ConstantineLegal Establishment and Constitution of the Christian or Catholic Church  THE public establishment of Christianity may be considered as one of those important and domestic revolutions which excite the most lively curiosity and afford the most valuable instruction The victories and the civil policy of Constantine no longer influence the state of Europe but a considerable portion of the globe still

Dominican  The Christianity of Constantine must be allowed in a much more vague and qualified sense and the nicest accuracy is required in tracing the slow and almost imperceptible gradations by which the monarch declared himself the protector and at length the proselyte of the church It was an arduous task to eradicate the habits and prejudices of his education to acknowledge the divine power of Christ and to understand that the truth of  his  revelation was incompatible with the worship of the gods The obstacles which he had probably experienced in his own mind instructed him to proceed with caution in the momentous change of a national religion and he insensibly discovered his new opinions as far as he could enforce them with  safety and with effect During the whole course of his reign the stream of Christianity flowed with a gentle though accelerated motion but its general direction was sometimes checked and sometimes diverted by the accidental circumstances of the times and by the prudence or possibly by the caprice of the monarch His ministers were permitted to signify the intentions of their master in the various language which was best adapted to their respective principles

endeavours tom vi p to excuse Constantine but the more zealous Baronius Annal Eccles A D No censures his profane conduct with truth and asperity  While this important revolution yet remained in suspense the Christians and the Pagans watched the conduct of their sovereign with the same anxiety but with very opposite sentiments The former were prompted by every motive of zeal as well as vanity to exaggerate the marks of his favour and the evidences of his faith The latter till their just apprehensions were changed into despair and  resentment attempted to conceal from the world and from themselves that the gods of Rome could no longer reckon the emperor in the number of their votaries The same passions and prejudices have engaged the partial writers of the times to connect the public profession of Christianity with the most glorious or the most ignominious aera of the reign of Constantine  Whatever symptoms of Christian piety might  His Pagan superstition  transpire in the discourses or actions of Constantine he persevered till he was near forty years of age in the practice of the established religion  Theodoret l i c seems to insinuate that Helena gave her son a Christian education but we may be assured from the superior authority of Eusebius in Vit Constant l iii c that she herself was indebted to Constantine for the knowledge of Christianity  and the same conduct which in the court of Nicomedia might be imputed to his fear could be ascribed only to the inclination or policy of the sovereign of Gaul His liberality restored and enriched the temples of the gods the medals which issued from his Imperial mint are impressed with the figures and attributes of Jupiter and Apollo of Mars and Hercules and his filial piety increased the council of Olympus by the solemn apotheosis of his father Constantius  See the medals of Constantine in Ducange and Banduri As few cities had retained the privilege of coining almost all the medals of that age issued from the mint under the sanction of the Imperial authority  But the devotion of Constantine was more peculiarly directed to the genius of the Sun the Apollo of Greek and Roman mythology and he was pleased to be represented with the symbols of the  God of Light and Poetry The unerring shafts of that deity the brightness of his eyes his laurel wreath immortal beauty and elegant accomplishments seem to point him out as the patron of a young hero The altars of Apollo were crowned with the votive offerings of Constantine and the credulous multitude were taught to believe that the emperor was permitted to behold with mortal eyes the visible majesty of their tutelar deity and that either waking or in a vision he was blessed with the auspicious omens of a long and victorious reign The Sun was universally celebrated as the invincible guide and protector of Constantine and the Pagans might reasonably expect that the insulted god would pursue with unrelenting vengeance the impiety of his ungrateful favourite  The panegyric of Eumenius vii inter Panegyr Vet which was pronounced a few months before the Italian war abounds with the most unexceptionable evidence of the Pagan superstition of Constantine and of his particular veneration for Apollo or the Sun to which Julian alludes Orat vii p  See Commentaire de Spanheim sur les Césars p    As long as Constantine exercised a limited  He protects the Christians of Gaul  sovereignty over the provinces of Gaul his Christian subjects were protected by the authority and perhaps by the laws of a prince who wisely left  A D  to the gods the care of vindicating their own honour If we may credit the assertion of Constantine himself he had been an indignant spectator of the savage cruelties which were inflicted by the hands of Roman soldiers on those citizens whose religion was their only crime  Constantin Orat ad Sanctos c But it might easily be shewn that the Greek translator has improved the sense of the Latin original and the aged emperor might recollect the persecution of Diocletian with a more lively abhorrence than he had actually felt in the days of his youth and Paganism  In the East and  in the West he had seen the different effects of severity and indulgence and as the former was rendered still more odious by the example of Galerius his implacable enemy the latter was recommended to his imitation by the authority and advice of a dying father The son of Constantius immediately suspended or repealed the edicts of persecution and granted the free exercise of their religious ceremonies to all those who had already professed themselves members of the church They were soon encouraged to depend on the favour as well as on the justice of their sovereign who had imbibed a secret and sincere reverence for the name of Christ and for the God of the Christians  See Euseb Hist Eccles l viii l ix and in Vit Const l i c Lactant Divin Institut i Caecilius de Mort Persecut c    About five months after the conquest of Italy  A D March  the emperor made a solemn and authentic declaration of his sentiments by the celebrated edict  Edict of Milan  of Milan which restored peace to the Catholic church In the personal interview of the two western princes Constantine by the ascendant of genius and power obtained the ready concurrence of his colleague Licinius the union of their names and authority disarmed the fury of Maximin and after the death of the tyrant of the East the edict of Milan was received as a general and fundamental law of the Roman world  Caecilius de Mort Persecut c has preserved the Latin original and Eusebius Hist Eccles l x c has given a Greektranslation of this perpetual edict which refers to some provisional regulations    The wisdom of the emperors provided for the restitution of all the civil and religious rights of which the Christians had been so unjustly deprived It was enacted that the places of worship and public lands which had been confiscated should be restored to the church without dispute without delay and without expence and this severe injunction was accompanied with a gracious promise that if any of the purchasers had paid a fair and adequate price they should be indemnified from the Imperial treasury The salutary regulations which guard the future tranquillity of the faithful are framed on the principles of enlarged and equal toleration and such an equality must have been interpreted by a recent sect as an advantageous and honourable distinction The two emperors proclaim to the world that they have granted a free and absolute power to the Christians and to all others of following the religion which each individual thinks proper to prefer to which he has addicted his mind and which he may deem the best adapted to his own use They carefully explain every ambiguous word remove every exception and exact from the governors of the provinces a strict obedience to the true and simple meaning of an edict which was designed to establish and secure without any limitation the claims of religious liberty They condescend to assign two weighty reasons which have induced them to allow this universal toleration the humane intention of consulting the peace and happiness  of their people and the pious hope that by such a conduct they shall appease and propitiate  the Deity  whose seat is in heaven They gratefully acknowledge the many signal proofs which they have received of the divine favour and they trust that the same Providence will for ever continue to protect the prosperity of the prince and people From these vague and indefinite expressions of piety three suppositions may be deduced of a different but not of an incompatible nature The mind of Constantine might fluctuate between the Pagan and the Christian religions According to the loose and complying notions of polytheism he might acknowledge the God of the Christians as  one  of the  many  deities who composed the hierarchy of heaven Or perhaps he might embrace the philosophic and pleasing idea that notwithstanding the variety of names of rites and of opinions all the sects and all the nations of mankind are united in the worship of the common Father and Creator of the universe  A panegyric of Constantine pronounced seven or eight months after the edict of Milan see Gothofred Chronolog Legum p and Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p uses the following remarkable expression  Summe rerum sator cujus tot nomina sunt quot linguas gentium esse voluisti quem enim te ipse dici velis scire non possumus  Panegyr Vet ix In explaining Constantine's progress in the faith Mosheim p c is ingenious subtle prolix    But the counsels of princes are more frequently influenced by views of temporal advantage than  Use and beauty of the Christian morality  by considerations of abstract and speculative truth The partial and increasing favour of Constantine  may naturally be referred to the esteem which he entertained for the moral character of the Christians and to a persuasion that the propagation of the gospel would inculcate the practice of private and public virtue Whatever latitude an absolute monarch may assume in his own conduct whatever indulgence he may claim for his own passions it is undoubtedly his interest that all his subjects should respect the natural and civil obligations of society But the operation of the wisest laws is imperfect and precarious They seldom inspire virtue they cannot always restrain vice Their power is insufficient to prohibit all that they condemn nor can they always punish the actions which they prohibit The legislators of antiquity had summoned to their aid the powers of education and of opinion But every principle which had once maintained the vigour and purity of Rome and Sparta was long since extinguished in a declining and despotic empire Philosophy still exercised her temperate sway over the human mind but the cause of virtue derived very feeble support from the influence of the Pagan superstition Under these discouraging circumstances a prudent magistrate might observe with pleasure the progress of a religion which diffused among the people a pure benevolent and universal system of ethics adapted to every duty and every condition of life recommended as the will and reason of the Supreme Deity and enforced by the sanction of eternal rewards or punishments The experience of Greek and Roman history could not inform the world how far the system of national  manners might be reformed and improved by the precepts of a divine revelation and Constantine might listen with some confidence to the flattering and indeed reasonable assurances of Lactantius The eloquent apologist seemed firmly to expect and almost ventured to promise  that  the establishment of Christianity would restore the innocence and felicity of the primitive age  that  the worship of the true God would extinguish war and dissension among those who mutually considered themselves as the children of a common parent  that  every impure desire every angry or selfish passion would be restrained by the knowledge of the gospel and  that  the magistrates might sheath the sword of justice among a people who would be universally actuated by the sentiments of truth and piety of equity and moderation of harmony and universal love  See the elegant description of Lactantius Divin Institut v who is much more perspicuous and positive than it becomes a discreet prophet    The passive and unresisting obedience which  Theory and practice of passive obedience  bows under the yoke of authority or even of oppression must have appeared in the eyes of an absolute monarch the most conspicuous and useful of the evangelic virtues  The political system of the Christians is explained by Grotius de Jure Belli et Pacis l i c Grotius was a republican and an exile but the mildness of his temper inclined him to support the established powers  The primitive Christians derived the institution of civil government not from the consent of the people but from the decrees of heaven The reigning emperor though he had usurped the sceptre by treason  and murder immediately assumed the sacred character of vicegerent of the Deity To the Deity alone he was accountable for the abuse of his power and his subjects were indissolubly bound by their oath of fidelity to a tyrant who had violated every law of nature and society The humble Christians were sent into the world as sheep among wolves and since they were not permitted to employ force even in the defence of their religion they should be still more criminal if they were tempted to shed the blood of their fellowcreatures in disputing the vain privileges or the sordid possessions of this transitory life Faithful to the doctrine of the apostle who in the reign of Nero had preached the duty of unconditional submission the Christians of the three first centuries preserved their conscience pure and innocent of the guilt of secret conspiracy or open rebellion While they experienced the rigour of persecution they were never provoked either to meet their tyrants in the field or indignantly to withdraw themselves into some remote and sequestered corner of the globe  Tertullian Apolog c Tamen nunquam Albiniani nec Nigriani vel Cassiani inveniri potuerunt Christiani Ad Scapulam c If this assertion be strictly true it excludes the Christians of that age from all civil and military employments which would have compelled them to take an active part in the service of their respective governors See Moyle's Works vol ii p  The protestants of France of Germany and of Britain who asserted with such intrepid courage their civil and religious freedom have been insulted by the invidious comparison between the conduct of the  primitive and of the reformed Christians  See the artful Bossuet Hist des Variations des Eglises Protestantes tom iii p and the malicious Bayle tom ii p I  name  Bayle for he was certainly the author of the Avis aux Refugiés consult the Dictionnaire Critique de Chauffepié tom i part ii p  Perhaps instead of censure some applause may be due to the superior sense and spirit of our ancestors who had convinced themselves that religion cannot abolish the unalienable rights of human nature  Buchanan is the earliest or at least the most celebrated of the reformers who has justified the theory of resistance See his Dialogue de Jure Regni apud Scotos tom ii p edit fol Ruddiman  Perhaps the patience of the primitive church may be ascribed to its weakness as well as to its virtue A sect of unwarlike plebeians without leaders without arms without fortifications must have encountered inevitable destruction in a rash and fruitless resistance to the master of the Roman legions But the Christians when they deprecated the wrath of Diocletian or solicited the favour of Constantine could allege with truth and confidence that they held the principle of passive obedience and that in the space of three centuries their conduct had always been conformable to their principles They might add that the throne of the emperors would be established on a fixed and permanent basis if all their subjects embracing the Christian doctrine should learn to suffer and to obey  In the general order of Providence princes and  Divine right of Constantine  tyrants are considered as the ministers of Heaven appointed to rule or to chastise the nations of the earth But sacred history affords many illustrious  examples of the more immediate interposition of the Deity in the government of his chosen people The sceptre and the sword were committed to the hands of Moses of Joshua of Gideon of David of the Maccabees the virtues of those heroes were the motive or the effect of the Divine favour the success of their arms was destined to atchieve the deliverance or the triumph of the church If the judges of Israel were occasional and temporary magistrates the kings of Judah derived from the royal unction of their great ancestor an hereditary and indefeasible right which could not be forfeited by their own vices nor recalled by the caprice of their subjects The same extraordinary providence which was no longer confined to the Jewish people might elect Constantine and his family as the protectors of the Christian world and the devout Lactantius announces in a prophetic tone the future glories of his long and universal reign  Lactant Divin Institut i Eusebius in the course of his history his life and his oration repeatedly inculcates the divine right of Constantine to the empire  Galerius and Maximin Maxentius and Licinius were the rivals who shared with the favourite of heaven the provinces of the empire The tragic deaths of Galerius and Maximin soon gratified the resentment and fulfilled the sanguine expectations of the Christians The success of Constantine against Maxentius and Licinius removed the two formidable competitors who still opposed the triumph of the second David and his cause might seem to claim the peculiar interposition of Providence The character  of the Roman tyrant disgraced the purple and human nature and though the Christians might enjoy his precarious favour they were exposed with the rest of his subjects to the effects of his wanton and capricious cruelty The conduct of Licinius soon betrayed the reluctance with which he had consented to the wise and humane regulations of the edict of Milan The convocation of provincial synods was prohibited in his dominions his Christian officers were ignominiously dismissed and if he avoided the guilt or rather danger of a general persecution his partial oppressions were rendered still more odious by the violation of a solemn and voluntary engagement  Our imperfect knowledge of the persecution of Licinius is derived from Eusebius Hist Eccles l x c Vit Constantin l i c l ii c Aurelius Victor mentions his cruelty in general terms  While the East according to the lively expression of Eusebius was involved in the shades of infernal darkness the auspicious rays of celestial light warmed and illuminated the provinces of the West The piety of Constantine was admitted as an unexceptionable proof of the justice of his arms and his use of victory confirmed the opinion of the Christians that their hero was inspired and conducted by the Lord of Hosts The conquest of Italy produced a general edict of toleration and as soon as the defeat of Licinius had invested Constantine with the sole dominion of the Roman world he immediately  A D  by circular letters exhorted all his subjects to imitate without delay the example of their sovereign  and to embrace the divine truth of Christianity  Euseb in Vit Constant l ii c    The assurance that the elevation of Constantine  Loyalty and zeal of the Christian party  was intimately connected with the designs of Providence instilled into the minds of the Christians two opinions which by very different means assisted the accomplishment of the prophecy Their warm and active loyalty exhausted in his favour every resource of human industry and they confidently expected that their strenuous efforts would be seconded by some divine and miraculous aid The enemies of Constantine have imputed to interested motives the alliance which he insensibly contracted with the Catholic church and which apparently contributes to the success of his ambition In the beginning of the fourth century the Christians still bore a very inadequate proportion to the inhabitants of the empire but among a degenerate people who viewed the change of masters with the indifference of slaves the spirit and union of a religious party might assist the popular leader to whose service from a principle of conscience they had devoted their lives and fortunes  In the beginning of the last century the Papists of England were only a  thirtieth  and the Protestants of France only a  fifteenth  part of the respective nations to whom their spirit and power were a constant object of apprehension See the relations which Bentivoglio who was then nuncio at Brussels and afterwards cardinal transmitted to the court of Rome Relazione tom ii p Bentivoglio was curious wellinformed but somewhat partial  The example of his father had instructed Constantine to esteem and to reward the merit of the Christians and in the distribution  of public offices he had the advantage of strengthening his government by the choice of ministers or generals in whose fidelity he could repose a just and unreserved confidence By the influence of these dignified missionaries the proselytes of the new faith must have multiplied in the court and army the Barbarians of Germany who filled the ranks of the legions were of a careless temper which acquiesced without resistance in the religion of their commander and when they passed the Alps it may fairly be presumed that a great number of the soldiers had already consecrated their swords to the service of Christ and of Constantine  This careless temper of the Germans appears almost uniformly in the history of the conversion of each of the tribes The legions of Constantine were recruited with Germans Zosimus l ii p and the court even of his father had been filled with Christians See the first book of the Life of Constantine by Eusebius  The habits of mankind and the interest of religion gradually abated the horror of war and bloodshed which had so long prevailed among the Christians and in the councils which were assembled under the gracious protection of Constantine the authority of the bishops was seasonably employed to ratify the obligation of the military oath and to inflict the penalty of excommunication on those soldiers who threw away their arms during the peace of the church  De his qui arma projiciunt in  pace  placuit eos abstinere a communione Concil Arelat Canon iii The best critics apply these words to the  peace of the church  While Constantine in his own dominions encreased the number and zeal of his faithful adherents he could depend on the support of a  powerful faction in those provinces which were still possessed or usurped by his rivals A secret disaffection was diffused among the Christian subjects of Maxentius and Licinius and the resentment which the latter did not attempt to conceal served only to engage them still more deeply in the interest of his competitor The regular correspondence which connected the bishops of the most distant provinces enabled them freely to communicate their wishes and their designs and to transmit without danger any useful intelligence or any pious contributions which might promote the service of Constantine who publicly declared that he had taken up arms for the deliverance of the church  Eusebius always considers the second civil war against Licinius as a sort of religious crusade At the invitation of the tyrant some Christian officers had resumed their  zones  or in other words had returned to the military service Their conduct was afterwards censured by the th canon of the council of Nice if this particular application may be received instead of the loose and general sense of the Greek interpreters Balsamon Zonaras and Alexis Aristenus See Beveridge Pandect Eccles Graec tom i p tom ii p Annotation    The enthusiasm which inspired the troops and  Expectation and belief of a miracle  perhaps the emperor himself had sharpened their swords while it satisfied their conscience They marched to battle with the full assurance that the same God who had formerly opened a passage to the Israelites through the waters of Jordan and had thrown down the walls of Jericho at the sound of the trumpets of Joshua would display his visible majesty and power in the victory of Constantine The evidence of ecclesiastical history is prepared  to affirm that their expectations were justified by the conspicuous miracle to which the conversion of the first Christian emperor has been almost unanimously ascribed The real or imaginary cause of so important an event deserves and demands the attention of posterity and I shall endeavour to form a just estimate of the famous vision of Constantine by a distinct consideration of the  standard  the  dream  and the  celestial sign  by separating the historical the natural and the marvellous parts of this extraordinary story which in the composition of a specious argument have been artfully confounded in one splendid and brittle mass  I An instrument of the tortures which were inflicted  The  Labarum  or standard of the cross  only on slaves and strangers became an object of horror in the eyes of a Roman citizen and the ideas of guilt of pain and of ignominy were closely united with the idea of the cross  Nomen ipsum  crucis  absit non modo a corpore civium Romanorum sed etiam a cogitatione oculis auribus Cicero pro Raberio c The Christian writers Justin Minucius Faelix Tertullian Jerom and Maximus of Turin have investigated with tolerable success the figure or likeness of a cross in almost every object of nature or art in the intersection of the meridian and equator the human face a bird flying a man swimming a mast and yard a plough a  standard  c c c See Lipsius de Cruce l i c  The piety rather than the humanity of Constantine soon abolished in his dominions the punishment which the Saviour of mankind had condescended to suffer  See Aurelius Victor who considers this law as one of the examples of Constantine's piety An edict so honourable to Christianity deserved a place in the Theodosian code instead of the indirect mention of it which seems to result from the comparison of the vth and xviiith titles of the ixth book  but the emperor had already  learned to despise the prejudices of his education and of his people before he could erect in the midst of Rome his own statue bearing a cross in its right hand with an inscription which referred the victory of his arms and the deliverance of Rome to the virtue of that salutary sign the true symbol of force and courage  Eusebius in Vit Constantin l i c This statue or at least the cross and inscription may be ascribed with more probability to the second or even the third visit of Constantine to Rome Immediately after the defeat of Maxentius the minds of the senate and people were scarcely ripe for this public monument  The same symbol sanctified the arms of the soldiers of Constantine the cross glittered on their helmet was engraved on their shields was interwoven into their banners and the consecrated emblems which adorned the person of the emperor himself were distinguished only by richer materials and more exquisite workmanship  Agnoscas regina libens mea signa necesse est  In quibus effigies  crucis  aut

Annal Eccles A D No has engraved a representation of the Labarum  as a long pike intersected by a transversal beam The silken veil which hung down from the beam was curiously enwrought with the images of the reigning monarch and his children The summit of the pike supported a crown of gold which inclosed the mysterious monogram at once expressive of the figure of the cross and the initial letters of the name of Christ  Transversâ X literâ summo capite circumflexo Christum in scutis notat Caecilius de M P c Cuper ad M P in edit Lactant tom ii p and Baronius A D No have engraved from ancient monuments several specimens as thus  chirho symbol shaped like P with horizontal cross bar  or  chirho symbol of standard form ☧  of these monograms which became extremely fashionable in the Christian world  The safety of the labarum was entrusted to fifty guards of approved valour and fidelity their station was marked by honours and emoluments and some fortunate accidents soon introduced an opinion that as long as the guards of the labarum were engaged in the execution of their office they were secure and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy In the second civil war Licinius felt and dreaded the power of this consecrated banner the sight of which in the distress of battle animated the soldiers of Constantine with an invincible enthusiasm and scattered terror and dismay through the ranks of the adverse legions  Euseb in Vit Constantin l ii c He introduces the Labarum before the Italian expedition but his narrative seems to indicate that it was never shewn at the head of an army till Constantine above ten years afterwards declared himself the enemy of Licinius and the deliverer of the church  The Christian  emperors who respected the example of Constantine displayed in all their military expeditions the standard of the cross but when the degenerate successors of Theodosius had ceased to appear in person at the head of their armies the labarum was deposited as a venerable but useless relic in the palace of Constantinople  See Cod Theod l vi tit xxv Sozomen l i c Theophan Chronograph p Theophanes lived towards the end of the eighth century almost five hundred years after Constantine The modern Greeks were not inclined to display in the field the standard of the empire and of Christianity and though they depended on every superstitious hope of  defence  the promise of  victory  would have appeared too bold a fiction  Its honours are still preserved on the medals of the Flavian family Their grateful devotion has placed the monogram of Christ in the midst of the ensigns of Rome The solemn epithets of safety of the republic glory of the army restoration of public happiness are equally applied to the religious and military trophies and there is still extant a medal of the emperor Constantius where the standard of the labarum is accompanied with these memorable words BY THIS SIGN THOU SHALT CONQUER  The Abbé du Voism p c alleges several of these medals and quotes a particular dissertation of a Jesuit the Pere de Grainville on this subject    II In all occasions of danger or distress it was  The dream of Constantine  the practice of the primitive Christians to fortify their minds and bodies by the sign of the cross which they used in all their ecclesiastical rites in  all the daily occurrences of life as an infallible preservative against every species of spiritual or temporal evil  Tertullian de Corona c Athanasius tom i p The learned jesuit Petavius Dogmata Theolog l xv c has collected many similar passages on the virtues of the cross which in the last age embarrassed our Protestant disputants  The authority of the church might alone have had sufficient weight to justify the devotion of Constantine who in the same prudent and gradual progress acknowledged the truth and assumed the symbol of Christianity But the testimony of a contemporary writer who in a formal treatise has avenged the cause of religion bestows on the piety of the emperor a more awful and sublime character He affirms with the most perfect confidence that in the night which preceded the last battle against Maxentius Constantine was admonished in a dream to inscribe the shields of his soldiers with the  celestial sign of God  the sacred monogram of the name of Christ that he executed the commands of heaven and that his valour and obedience were rewarded by the decisive victory of the Milvian bridge Some considerations might perhaps incline a sceptical mind to suspect the judgment or the veracity of the rhetorician whose pen either from zeal or interest was devoted to the cause of the prevailing faction  Caecilius de M P c It is certain that this historical declamation was composed and published while Licinius sovereign of the East still preserved the friendship of Constantine and of the Christians Every reader of taste must perceive that the style is of a very different and inferior character to that of Lactantius and such indeed is the judgment of Le Clerc and Lardner Bibliotheque Ancienne et Moderne tom iii p Credibility of the Gospel c part ii vol vii p Three arguments from the title of the book and from the names of Donatus and Caecilius are produced by the advocates for Lactantius See the P Lestocq tom ii p Each of these proofs is singly weak and defective but their concurrence has great weight I have often fluctuated and shall  tamely  follow the Colbert MS in calling the author whoever he was Caecilius  He appears to have published his  deaths of the persecutors at Nicomedia about three years after the Roman victory but the interval of a thousand miles and a thousand days will allow an ample latitude for the invention of declaimers the credulity of party and the tacit approbation of the emperor himself who might listen without indignation to a marvellous tale which exalted his fame and promoted his designs In favour of Licinius who still dissembled his animosity to the Christians the same author has provided a similar vision of a form of prayer which was communicated by an angel and repeated by the whole army before they engaged the legions of the tyrant Maximin The frequent repetition of miracles serves to provoke where it does not subdue the reason of mankind  Caecilius de M P c There seems to be some reason in the observation of M de Voltaire Oeuvres tom xiv p who ascribes to the success of Constantine the superior fame of his Labarum above the angel of Licinius Yet even this angel is favourably entertained by Pagi Tillemont Fleury c who are fond of encreasing their stock of miracles  but if the dream of Constantine is separately considered it may be naturally explained either by the policy or the enthusiasm of the emperor Whilst his anxiety for the approaching day which must decide the fate of the empire was suspended by a short and interrupted slumber the venerable  form of Christ and the wellknown symbol of his religion might forcibly offer themselves to the active fancy of a prince who reverenced the name and had perhaps secretly implored the power of the God of the Christians As readily might a consummate statesman indulge himself in the use of one of those military stratagems one of those pious frauds which Philip and Sertorius had employed with such art and effect  Besides these wellknown examples Tollius Preface to Bolleau's translation of Longinus has discovered a vision of Antigonus who assured his troops that he had seen a pentagon the symbol of safety with these words "In this conquer" But Toliius has most inexcusably omitted to produce his authority and his own character literary as well as moral is not free from reproach See Chauffepié Dictionnaire Critique tom iv p Without insisting on the silence of Diodorus Plutarch Justin c it may be observed that Polyaenus who in a separate chapter l iv c has collected nineteen military stratagems of Antigonus is totally ignorant of this remarkable vision  The praeternatural origin of dreams was universally admitted by the nations of antiquity and a considerable part of the Gallic army was already prepared to place their confidence in the salutary sign of the Christian religion The secret vision of Constantine could be disproved only by the event and the intrepid hero who had passed the Alps and the Apennine might view with careless despair the consequences of a defeat under the walls of Rome The senate and people exulting in their own deliverance from an odious tyrant acknowledged that the victory of Constantine surpassed the powers of man without daring to insinuate that it had been obtained by the protection of the  Gods  The triumphal arch which was erected  about three years after the event proclaims in ambiguous language that by the greatness of his own mind and by an  instinct  or impulse of the Divinity he had saved and avenged the Roman republic  Instinctu Divinitatis mentis magnitudine The inscription on the triumphal arch of Constantine which has been copied by Baronius Gruter c may still be perused by every curious traveller  The Pagan orator who had seized an earlier opportunity of celebrating the virtues of the conqueror supposes that he alone enjoyed a secret and intimate commerce with the Supreme Being who delegated the care of mortals to his subordinate deities and thus assigns a very plausible reason why the subjects of Constantine should not presume to embrace the new religion of their sovereign  Habes profecto aliquid cum illa mente Divinâ secretum quae delegatâ nostrâ Diis Minoribus curâ uni se tibi dignatur ostendere Panegyr Vet ix

the whole army as well as the emperor himself who was yet undetermined in the choice of a religion but his astonishment was converted into faith by the vision of the ensuing night Christ appeared before his eyes and displaying the same celestial sign of the cross he directed Constantine to frame a similar standard and to march with an assurance of victory against Maxentius and all his enemies  Eusebius l i c The silence of the same Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History is deeply felt by those advocates for the miracle who are not absolutely callous  The learned bishop of Caesarea appears to be sensible that the recent discovery of this marvellous anecdote would excite some surprise and distrust among the most pious of his readers Yet instead of ascertaining the precise circumstances of time and place which always serve to detect falsehood or establish truth  The narrative of Constantine seems to indicate that he saw the cross in the sky before he passed the Alps against Maxentius The scene has been fixed by provincial vanity at Treves Besancon c See Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p  instead of collecting and recording the evidence of so many living witnesses who must have been spectators of this stupendous miracle  The pious Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p rejects with a sigh the useful Acts of Artemius a veteran and a martyr who attests as an eyewitness the vision of Constantine  Eusebius contents himself with alleging a very singular testimony that of the deceased Constantine who many years after the event in the freedom of conversation  had related to him this extraordinary incident of his own life and had attested the truth of it by a solemn oath The prudence and gratitude of the learned prelate forbade him to suspect the veracity of his victorious master but he plainly intimates that in a fact of such a nature he should have refused his assent to any meaner authority This motive of credibility could not survive the power of the Flavian family and the celestial sign which the Infidels might afterwards deride  Gelasius Cyzic in Act Concil Nicen l i c  was disregarded by the Christians of the age which immediately followed the conversion of Constantine  The advocates for the vision are unable to produce a single testimony from the Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries who in their voluminous writings repeatedly celebrate the triumph of the church and of Constantine As these venerable men had not any dislike to a miracle we may suspect and the suspicion is confirmed by the ignorance of Jerom that they were all unacquainted with the life of Constantine by Eusebius This tract was recovered by the diligence of those who translated or continued his Ecclesiastical History and who have represented in various colours the vision of the cross  But the Catholic church both of the East and of the West has adopted a prodigy which favours or seems to favour the popular worship of the cross The vision of Constantine maintained an honourable place in the legend of superstition till the bold and sagacious spirit of criticism presumed to depreciate the triumph and to arraign the truth of the first Christian emperor  Godefroy was the first who in the year Not ad Philostorgium l i c p expressed any doubt of a miracle which had been supported with equal zeal by Cardinal Baronius and the Centuriators of Magdeburgh Since that time many of the Protestant critics have inclined towards doubt and disbelief The objections are urged with great force by M Chauffepié Dictionnaire Critique tom iv p and in the year a doctor of Sorbonne the Abbé du Voism published an Apology which deserves the praise of learning and moderation    The protestant and philosophic readers of the present age will incline to believe that in the account of his own conversion Constantine attested  The conversion of Constantine might be sincere  a wilful falsehood by a solemn and deliberate perjury They may not hesitate to pronounce that in the choice of a religion his mind was determined only by a sense of interest and that according to the expression of a profane poet  Lors Constantin dit ces propres paroles  J'ai renversé le culte des idoles  Sur les debris de leurs temples fumans  Au Dieu du Ciel j'ai prodigué l'encens  Mais tous mes soins pour sa grandeur supreme  N'curent jamais d'autre objêt que moimême  Les saints autels n'etoient à mes regards  Qu'un marchepié du trône des Césars  L'ambition la fureur les delices  Etoient mes Dieux avoient mes sacrifices  L'or des Chrétiens leurs intrigues leur sang  Ont cimenté ma fortune et mon rang  The poem which contains these lines may be read with pleasure but cannot be named with decency  he used the altars of the church as a convenient footstool to the throne of the empire A conclusion so harsh and so absolute is not however warranted by our knowledge of human nature of Constantine or of Christianity In an age of religious fervour the most artful statesmen are observed to feel some part of the enthusiasm which they inspire and the most orthodox saints assume the dangerous privilege of defending the cause of  truth by the arms of deceit and falsehood Personal interest is often the standard of our belief as well as of our practice and the same motives of temporal advantage which might influence the public conduct and professions of Constantine would insensibly dispose his mind to embrace a religion so propitious to his fame and fortunes His vanity was gratified by the flattering assurance that  he  had been chosen by Heaven to reign over the earth success had justified his divine title to the throne and that title was founded on the truth of the Christian revelation As real virtue is sometimes excited by undeserved applause the specious piety of Constantine if at first it was only specious might gradually by the influence of praise of habit and of example be matured into serious faith and fervent devotion The bishops and teachers of the new

masters of controversy could patiently watch the soft and yielding moments of persuasion and dexterously apply the arguments which were the best adapted to his character and understanding Whatever advantages might be derived from the acquisition of an Imperial proselyte he was distinguished by the splendour of his purple rather than by the superiority of wisdom or virtue from the many thousands of his subjects who had embraced the doctrines of Christianity Nor can it be deemed incredible that the mind of an unlettered soldier should have yielded to the weight of evidence which in a more enlightened age has satisfied or subdued the reason of a Grotius a Pascal or a Locke In the midst of the incessant labours of his great office this soldier employed or affected to employ the hours of the night in the diligent study of the Scriptures and the composition of theological discourses which he afterwards pronounced in the presence of a numerous and applauding audience In a very long discourse  which is still extant the royal preacher expatiates on the various proofs of religion but he dwells with peculiar complacency on the Sybilline verses  See Constantin Orat ad Sanctos c He chiefly depends on a mysterious acrostic composed in the sixth age after the Deluge by the Erythraean Sybil and translated by Cicero into Latin The initial letters of the thirtyfour Greek verses form this prophetic sentence JESUS CHRIST SON OF GOD SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD  and the fourth eclogue of Virgil  In his paraphrase of Virgil the emperor has frequently assisted and improved the literal sense of the Latin text See Blondel des Sybilles l i c    The fourth eclogue of Virgil  Forty years before the birth of Christ the Mantuan bard as if inspired by the celestial muse of Isaiah had celebrated with all the pomp of Oriental metaphor the return of the Virgin the fall of the serpent the approaching birth of a godlike child the offspring of the great Jupiter who should expiate the guilt of human kind and govern the peaceful universe with the virtues of his father the rise and appearance of an heavenly race a primitive nation throughout the world and the gradual restoration of the innocence and felicity of the golden age The poet was perhaps unconscious of the secret sense and object of these sublime predictions which have been so unworthily applied to the infant son of a consul or a triumvir  The different claims of an elder and younger son of Pollio of Julia of Drusus of Marcellus are found to be incompatible with chronology history and the good sense of Virgil  but if a more splendid and indeed specious interpretation of the fourth eclogue contributed to the conversion of the first Christian emperor Virgil  may deserve to be ranked among the most successful missionaries of the gospel  See Lowth de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum Praelect xxi p In the examination of the fourth eclogue the respectable bishop of London has displayed learning taste ingenuity and a temperate enthusiasm which exalts his fancy without degrading his judgment    The awful mysteries of the Christian faith and  Devotion and privileges of Constantine  worship were concealed from the eyes of strangers and even of catechumens with an affected secrecy which served to excite their wonder and curiosity  The distinction between the public and the secret parts of divine service the  missa catechumenorum  and the  missa fidelium  and the mysterious veil which piety or policy had cast over the latter are very judiciously explained by Thiers Exposition du Saint Sacrement l i c p but as on this subject the Papists may reasonably be suspected a Protestant reader will depend with more confidence on the learned Bingham Antiquities l x c  But the severe rules of discipline which the prudence of the bishops had instituted were relaxed by the same prudence in favour of an Imperial proselyte whom it was so important to allure by every gentle condescension into the pale of the church and Constantine was permitted at least by a tacit dispensation to enjoy  most  of the privileges before he had contracted  any  of the obligations of a Christian Instead of retiring from the congregation when the voice of the deacon dismissed the profane multitude he prayed with the faithful disputed with the bishops preached on the most sublime and intricate subjects of theology celebrated with sacred rites the vigil of Easter and publicly declared himself not only a partaker but in some measure a priest  and hierophant of the Christian mysteries  See Eusebius in Vit Const l iv c and the whole tenor of Constantine's Sermon The faith and devotion of the emperor has furnished Baronius with a specious argument in favour of his early baptism  The pride of Constantine might assume and his services had deserved some extraordinary distinction an illtimed rigour might have blasted the unripened fruits of his conversion and if the doors of the church had been strictly closed against a prince who had deserted the altars of the gods the master of the empire would have been left destitute of any form of religious worship In his last visit to Rome he piously disclaimed and insulted the superstition of his ancestors by refusing to lead the military procession of the equestrian order and to offer the public vows to the Jupiter of the Capitoline Hill  Zosimus l ii p  Many years before his baptism and death Constantine had proclaimed to the world that neither his person nor his image should ever more be seen within the walls of an idolatrous temple while he distributed through the provinces a variety of medals and pictures which represented the emperor in an humble and suppliant posture of Christian devotion  Eusebius in Vit Constant l iv c    The pride of Constantine who refused the privileges  Delay of his baptism till the approach of death  of a catechumen cannot easily be explained or excused but the delay of his baptism may be justified by the maxims and the practice of ecclesiastical antiquity The sacrament of baptism  The theory and practice of antiquity with regard to the sacrament of baptism have been copiously explained by Dom Chardon Hist des Sacremens tom i p Dom Martenne de Ritibus Ecclesiae Antiquis tom i and by Bingham in the tenth and eleventh books of his Christian Antiquities One circumstance may be observed in which the modern churches have materially departed from the ancient custom The sacrament of baptism even when it was administered to infants was immediately followed by confirmation and the holy communion  was regularly administered by the bishop himself with his assistant clergy in the cathedral church of the diocese during the fifty days between the solemn festivals of Easter and Pentecost and this holy term admitted a numerous band of infants and adult persons into the bosom of the church The discretion of parents often suspended the baptism of their children till they could understand the obligations which they contracted the severity of ancient bishops exacted from the new converts a noviciate of two or three years and the catechumens themselves from different motives of a temporal or a spiritual nature were seldom impatient to assume the character of perfect and initiated Christians The sacrament of baptism was supposed to contain a full and absolute expiation of sin and the soul was instantly restored to its original purity and entitled to the promise of eternal salvation Among the proselytes of Christianity there were many who judged it imprudent to precipitate a salutary rite which could not be repeated to throw away an inestimable privilege which could never be recovered By the delay of their baptism they could venture freely to indulge their passions in  the enjoyment of this world while they still retained in their own hands the means of a sure and easy absolution  The fathers who censured this criminal delay could not deny the certain and victorious efficacy even of a deathbed baptism The ingenious rhetoric of Chrysostom could find only three arguments against these prudent Christians That we should love and pursue virtue for her own sake and not merely for the reward That we may be surprised by death without an opportunity of baptism That although we shall be placed in heaven we shall only twinkle like little stars when compared to the suns of righteousness who have run their appointed course with labour with success and with glory Chrysostom in Epist ad Hebraeos Homil xiii apud Chardon Hist des Sacremens tom i p I believe that this delay of baptism though attended with the most pernicious consequences was never condemned by any general or provincial council or by any public act or declaration of the church The zeal of the bishops was easily kindled on much slighter occasions  The sublime theory of the gospel had made a much fainter impression on the heart than on the understanding of Constantine himself He pursued the great object of his ambition through the dark and bloody paths of war and policy and after the victory he abandoned himself without moderation to the abuse of his fortune Instead of asserting his just superiority above the imperfect heroism and prophane philosophy of Trajan and the Antonines the mature age of Constantine forfeited the reputation which he had acquired in his youth As he gradually advanced in the knowledge of truth he proportionably declined in the practice of virtue and the same year of his reign in which he convened the council of Nice was polluted by the execution or rather murder of his eldest son This date is alone sufficient to refute the ignorant and malicious  suggestions of Zosimus  Zosimus l ii p For this disingenuous falsehood he has deserved and experienced the harshest treatment from all the ecclesiastical writers except Cardinal Baronius A D No who had occasion to employ the Infidel on a particular service against the Arian Eusebius  who affirms that after the death of Crispus the remorse of his father accepted from the ministers of Christianity the expiation which he had vainly solicited from the Pagan pontiffs At the time of the death of Crispus the emperor could no longer hesitate in the choice of a religion he could no longer be ignorant that the church was possessed of an infallible remedy though he chose to defer the application of it till the approach of death had removed the temptation and danger of a relapse The bishops whom he summoned in his last illness to the palace of Nicomedia were edified by the fervour with which he requested and received the sacrament of baptism by the solemn protestation that the remainder of his life should be worthy of a disciple of Christ and by his humble refusal to wear the Imperial purple after he had been clothed in the white garment of a Neophyte The example and reputation of Constantine seemed to countenance the delay of baptism  Eusebius l iv c The bishop of Caesarea supposes the salvation of Constantine with the most perfect confidence  Future tyrants were encouraged to believe that the innocent blood which they might shed in a long reign would instantly be washed away in the waters of regeneration and the abuse of religion dangerously undermined the foundations of moral virtue  The gratitude of the church has exalted the virtues and excused the failings of a generous patron who seated Christianity on the throne of  Propagation of Christianity  the Roman world and the Greeks who celebrate the festival of the Imperial saint seldom mention the name of Constantine without adding the title of  equal to the Apostles  See Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p The Greeks the Russians and in the darker ages the Latins themselves have been desirous of placing Constantine in the catalogue of saints  Such a comparison if it alludes to the character of those divine missionaries must be imputed to the extravagance of impious flattery But if the parallel is confined to the extent and number of their evangelic victories the success of Constantine might perhaps equal that of the Apostles themselves By the edicts of toleration he removed the temporal disadvantages which had hitherto retarded the progress of Christianity and its active and numerous ministers received a free permission a liberal encouragement to recommend the salutary truths of revelation by every argument which could affect the reason or piety of mankind The exact balance of the two religions continued but a moment and the piercing eye of ambition and avarice soon discovered that the profession of Christianity might contribute to the interest of the present as well as of a future life  See the third and fourth books of his life He was accustomed to say that whether Christ was preached in pretence or in truth he should still rejoice l iii c  The hopes of wealth and honours the example of an emperor his exhortations his  irresistible smiles diffused conviction among the venal and obsequious crowds which usually fill the apartments of a palace The cities which signalized a forward zeal by the voluntary destruction of their temples were distinguished by municipal privileges and rewarded with popular donatives and the new capital of the East gloried in the singular advantage that Constantinople was never profaned by the worship of idols  M de Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p has defended with strength and spirit the virgin purity of Constantinople against some malevolent insinuations of the Pagan Zosimus  As the lower ranks of society are governed by imitation the conversion of those who possessed any eminence of birth of power or of riches was soon followed by dependent multitudes  The author of the Histoire Politique et Philosophique des deux Indes tom i p condemns a law of Constantine which gave freedom to all the slaves who should embrace Christianity The emperor did indeed publish a law which restrained the Jews from circumcising perhaps from keeping any Christian slaves See Euseb in Vit Constant l iv c and Cod Theod l xvi tit ix with Godefroy's Commentary tom vi p But this imperfect exception related only to the Jews and the great body of slaves who were the property of Christian or Pagan masters could not improve their temporal condition by changing their religion I am ignorant by what guides the Abbé Raynal was deceived as the total absence of quotations is the unpardonable blemish of his entertaining history  The salvation of the common people was purchased at an easy rate if it be true that in one year twelve thousand men were baptized at Rome besides a proportionable number of women and children and that a white garment with twenty pieces of gold had been promised by the emperor  to every convert  See Acta S  t  Silvestri and Hist Eccles Nicephor Callist l vii c ap Baronium Annal Eccles A D No Such evidence is contemptible enough but these circumstances are in themselves so probable that the learned Dr Howell History of the World vol iii p has not scrupled to adopt them  The powerful influence of Constantine was not circumscribed by the narrow limits of his life or of his dominions The education which he bestowed on his sons and nephews secured to the empire a race of princes whose faith was still more lively and sincere as they imbibed in their earliest infancy the spirit or at least the doctrine of Christianity War and commerce had spread the knowledge of the gospel beyond the confines of the Roman provinces and the Barbarians who had disdained an humble and proscribed sect soon learned to esteem a religion which had been so lately embraced by the greatest monarch and the most civilized nation of the globe  The conversion of the Barbarians under the reign of Constantine is celebrated by the ecclesiastical historians see Sozomen l ii c and Theodoret l i c But Rufinus the Latin translator of Eusebius deserves to be considered as an original authority His information was curiously collected from one of the companions of the apostle of Aethiopia and from Bacurius an Iberian prince who was count of the domestics Father Mamachi has given an ample compilation on the progress of Christianity in the first and second volumes of his great but imperfect work  The Goths and Germans who enlisted under the standard of Rome revered the cross which glittered at the head of the legions and their fierce countrymen received at the same time the lessons of faith and of humanity The kings of Iberia and Armenia worshipped the  God of their protector and their subjects who have invariably preserved the name of Christians soon formed a sacred and perpetual connection with their Roman brethren The Christians of Persia were suspected in time of war of preferring their religion to their country but as long as peace subsisted between the two empires the persecuting spirit of the Magi was effectually restrained by the interposition of Constantine  See in Eusebius in Vit Constant l iv c the

expect that the cheerful submission of the Christian clergy as well as people would be the result of conscience and gratitude It was long since established as a fundamental maxim of the Roman constitution that every rank of citizens were alike subject to the laws and that the care of religion was the right as well as duty of the civil magistrate Constantine and his successors could not easily persuade themselves that they had forfeited by their conversion any branch of the Imperial prerogatives or that they were incapable of giving laws to a religion which they had protected and embraced The emperors still continued to exercise a supreme jurisdiction over the ecclesiastical order and the sixteenth book of the  A D  Theodosian code represents under a variety of titles the

which from the time of Numa to that of Augustus had always been exercised by one of the most eminent of the senators was at length united to the Imperial dignity The first magistrate of the state as often as he was prompted by superstition or policy performed with his own hands the sacerdotal functions  M de la Bastie Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xv p has evidently proved that Augustus and his successors exercised in person all the sacred functions of pontifex maximus or highpriest of the Roman empire  nor was there any order of priests either at Rome or in the provinces who claimed a more sacred character among men or a more intimate communication with the Gods But in the Christian church which entrusts the service of the altar to a perpetual succession of consecrated ministers the monarch whose spiritual rank is less honourable than that of the meanest deacon was seated below the rails of the sanctuary and confounded with the rest of the faithful multitude  Something of a contrary practice had insensibly prevailed in the church of Constantinople but the rigid Ambrose commanded Theodosius to retire below the rails and taught him to know the difference between a king and a priest See Theodoret l v c    The emperor might be saluted as the father of his people but he owed a filial duty and reverence to the fathers of the church and the same marks of respect which Constantine had paid to the persons of saints and confessors were soon exacted by the pride of the episcopal order  At the table of the emperor Maximus Martin bishop of Tours

between the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions embarrased the operations of the Roman government and a pious emperor was alarmed by the guilt and danger of touching with a profane hand the ark of the covenant The separation of men into the two orders of the clergy and of the laity was indeed familiar to many nations of antiquity and the priests of India of Persia of Assyria of Judea of Aethiopia of Egypt and of Gaul derived from a celestial origin the temporal power and possessions which they had acquired These venerable institutions had gradually assimilated themselves to the manners and government of their respective countries  Plutarch in his treatise of Isis and Osiris informs us that the kings of Egypt who were not already priests were initiated after their election into the sacerdotal order  but the opposition or  contempt of the civil power served to cement the discipline of the primitive church The Christians had been obliged to elect their own magistrates to raise and distribute a peculiar revenue and to regulate the internal policy of their republic by a code of laws which were ratified by the consent of the people and the practice of three hundred years When Constantine embraced the faith of the Christians he seemed to contract a perpetual alliance with a distinct and independent society and the privileges granted or confirmed by that emperor or by his successors were accepted not as the precarious favours of the court but as the just and inalienable rights of the ecclesiastical order  The Catholic church was administered by the  State of the bishops under the Christian emperors  spiritual and legal jurisdiction of eighteen hundred bishops  The numbers are not ascertained by any ancient writer or original catalogue for the partial lists of

church which was almost commensurate with the Roman empire The ninth book of the Christian Antiquities is a very accurate map of ecclesiastical geography  of whom one thousand were seated in the Greek and eight hundred in the Latin provinces of the empire The extent and boundaries of their respective dioceses had been variously and accidentally decided by the zeal and success of the first missionaries by the wishes of the people and by the propagation of the gospel Episcopal churches were closely planted along the banks of the Nile on the seacoast of Africa in the proconsular  Asia and through the southern provinces of Italy The bishops of Gaul and Spain of Thrace and Pontus reigned over an ample territory and delegated their rural suffragans to execute the subordinate duties of the pastoral office  On the subject of the rural bishops or  Chorepiscopi  who voted in synods and conferred the minor orders see Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom i p c and Chardon Hist des Sacremens tom v p c They do not appear till the fourth century and this equivocal character which had excited the jealousy of the prelates was abolished before the end of the tenth both in the East and the West  A Christian diocese might be spread over a province or reduced to a village but all the bishops possessed an equal and indelible character they all derived the same powers and privileges from the apostles from the people and from the laws While the  civil  and  military  professions were separated by the policy of Constantine a new and perpetual order of  ecclesiastical  ministers always respectable sometimes dangerous was established in the church and state The important review of their station and attributes may be distributed under the following heads I Popular election II Ordination of the clergy III Property IV Civil jurisdiction V Spiritual censures VI Exercise of public oratory VII Privilege of legislative assemblies  I The freedom of elections subsisted long after

subjects of Rome enjoyed in the church the privilege which they had lost in the republic of chusing the magistrates whom they were bound to obey As soon as a bishop had closed his eyes the metropolitan issued a commission to one of his suffragans to administer the vacant see and prepare within a limited time the future election The right of voting was vested in the inferior clergy who were best qualified to judge of the merit of the candidates in the senators or nobles of the city all those who were distinguished by their rank or property and finally in the whole body of the people

silenced by their tumultuous acclamations the voice of reason and the laws of discipline These acclamations might accidentally fix on the head of the most deserving competitor of some ancient presbyter some holy monk or some layman conspicuous for his zeal and piety But the episcopal chair was solicited especially in the great and opulent cities of the empire as a temporal rather than as a spiritual dignity The interested views the selfish and angry passions the arts of perfidy and dissimulation the secret corruption the open and even bloody violence which had formerly disgraced the freedom of election in the commonwealths  of Greece and Rome too often influenced the choice of the successors of the apostles While one of the candidates boasted the honours of his family a second

epistles of Sidonius Apollinaris iv vii exhibit some of the scandals of the Gallican church and Gaul was less polished and less corrupt than the East  The civil as well as ecclesiastical laws attempted to exclude the populace from this solemn and important transaction The canons of ancient discipline by requiring several episcopal qualifications of age station c restrained in some measure the indiscriminate caprice of the electors The authority of the provincial bishops who were assembled in the vacant church to consecrate the choice of the people was interposed to moderate their passions and to correct their mistakes The bishops could refuse to ordain an unworthy candidate and the rage of contending factions sometimes accepted their impartial mediation The submission or the resistance of the clergy and people on various occasions afforded different precedents which were insensibly converted into positive laws and provincial customs  A compromise was sometimes introduced by law or by consent either the bishops or the people chose one of the three candidates who had been named by the other party  but it was every where admitted as a fundamental maxim of religious policy that no bishop could be imposed on an orthodox church without the consent of its members The emperors as the  guardians of the public peace and as the first citizens of Rome and Constantinople might effectually declare their wishes in the choice of a primate but those absolute monarchs respected the freedom of ecclesiastical elections and while they distributed and resumed the honours of the state and army they allowed eighteen hundred perpetual magistrates to receive their important offices from the free suffrages of the people  All the examples quoted by Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom ii l ii c p appear to be extraordinary acts of power and even of oppression The confirmation of the bishop of Alexandria is mentioned by Philostorgius as a more regular proceeding Hist Eccles l ii  It was agreeable to the dictates of justice that these magistrates should not desert an honourable station from which they could not be removed but the wisdom of councils endeavoured without much success to enforce the residence and to prevent the translation of bishops The discipline of the West was indeed less relaxed than that of the East but the same passions which made those regulations necessary rendered them ineffectual The reproaches which angry prelates have so vehemently urged against each other serve only to expose their common guilt and their mutual indiscretion  II The bishops alone possessed the faculty of  II Ordination of the clergy  spiritual  generation and this extraordinary privilege might compensate in some degree for the painful celibacy  The celibacy of the clergy during the first five or six centuries is a subject of discipline and indeed of controversy which has been very diligently examined See in particular Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom i l ii c lx lxi p and Bingham's Antiquities l iv c By each of these learned but partial critics one half of the truth is produced and the other is concealed  which was imposed as a virtue  as a duty and at length as a positive obligation The religions of antiquity which established a separate order of priests dedicated a holy race a tribe or family to the perpetual service of the Gods  Diodorus Siculus attests and approves the hereditary succession of the priesthood among the Egyptians the Chaldeans and the Indians l i p l ii p edit Wesseling The magi are described by Ammianus as a very numerous family  Per saecula multa ad praesens unâ eâdemque prosapiâ multitudo creata Deorum cultibus dedicata  xxiii    Ausonius celebrates the  Stirps Druidarum  De Professorib Burdigal iv but we may infer from the remark of Caesar vi that in the Celtic hierarchy some room was left for choice and emulation  Such institutions were founded for possession rather than conquest The children of the priests enjoyed with proud and indolent security their sacred inheritance and the fiery spirit of enthusiasm was abated by the cares the pleasures and the endearments of domestic life But the Christian sanctuary was open to every ambitious candidate who aspired to its heavenly promises or temporal possessions The office of priests like that of soldiers or magistrates was strenuously exercised by those men whose temper and abilities had prompted them to embrace the ecclesiastical profession or who had been selected by a discerning bishop as the best qualified to promote the glory and interest of the church The bishops  The subject of the vocation ordination obedience c of the clergy is laboriously discussed by Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom ii p and Bingham in the th book of his Antiquities more especially the th th and th chapters When the brother of St Jerom was ordained in Cyprus the deacons forcibly stopped his mouth lest he should make a solemn protestation which might invalidate the holy rites  till the abuse was restrained by  the prudence of the laws might constrain the reluctant and protect the distressed and the imposition of hands for ever bestowed some of the most valuable privileges of civil society The whole body of the Catholic clergy more numerous perhaps than the legions was exempted by the emperors from all service private or public all municipal offices and all personal taxes and contributions which pressed on their fellowcitizens with intolerable weight and the duties of their holy profession were accepted as a full discharge of their obligations to the republic  The charter of immunities which the clergy obtained from the Christian emperors is contained in the th book of the Theodosian code and is illustrated with tolerable candour by the learned Godefroy whose mind was balanced by the opposite prejudices of a civilian and a protestant  Each bishop acquired an absolute and indefeasible right to the perpetual obedience of the clerk whom he ordained the clergy of each episcopal church with its dependent parishes formed a regular and permanent society and the cathedrals of Constantinople  Justinian Novell ciii Sixty presbyters or priests one hundred deacons forty deaconesses ninety subdeacons one hundred and ten readers twentyfive chanters and one hundred doorkeepers in all five hundred and twentyfive This moderate number was fixed by the emperor to relieve the distress of the church which had been involved in debt and usury by the expence of a much higher establishment  and Carthage  Universus clerus

church exclusive of the episcopal character But the four inferior ranks the minor orders are now reduced to empty and useless titles  and numbers were insensibly multiplied by the superstition of the times which introduced into the church the splendid ceremonies of a Jewish or Pagan temple and a long train of priests deacons subdeacons acolythes exorcists readers singers and doorkeepers contributed in their respective stations to swell the pomp and harmony of religious worship The clerical name and privilege were extended to many pious fraternities who devoutly supported the ecclesiastical throne  See Cod Theodos l xvi tit leg Godefroy's Commentary and the Ecclesiastical History of Alexandria shew the danger of these pious institutions which often disturbed the peace of that turbulent capital  Six hundred  parabolani  or adventurers visited the sick at Alexandria eleven hundred  copiatae  or gravediggers buried the dead at Constantinople and the swarms of monks who arose from the Nile overspread and darkened the face of the Christian world  III The edict of Milan secured the revenue as  III Property  well as the peace of the church  The edict of Milan de M P c acknowledges by reciting that there existed a species of landed property ad jus corporis eorum id est ecclesiarum non hominum singulorum pertinentia Such a solemn declaration of the supreme magistrate must have been received in all the tribunals as a maxim of civil law  The Christians not only recovered the lands and houses of which  A D  they had been stripped by the persecuting laws of  Diocletian but they acquired a perfect title to all the possessions which they had hitherto enjoyed by the connivance of the magistrate As soon as Christianity became the religion of the emperor and the empire the national clergy might claim a decent and honourable maintenance and the payment of an annual tax might have delivered the people from the more oppressive tribute which superstition imposes on her votaries But as the wants and expences of the church encreased with her prosperity the ecclesiastical order was still supported and enriched by the voluntary oblations of the faithful Eight years after the edict of Milan Constantine granted to all his  A D  subjects the free and universal permission of bequeathing their fortunes to the holy Catholic church  Habeat unusquisque licentiam sanctissimo Catholicae  ecclesiae  venerabilique concilio decedens bonorum quod optavit relinquere Cod Theodos l xvi tit ii leg This law was published at Rome A D at a time when Constantine might foresee the probability of a rupture with the emperor of the East  and their devout liberality which during their lives was checked by luxury or avarice flowed with a profuse stream at the hour of their death The wealthy Christians were encouraged by the example of their sovereign An absolute monarch who is rich without patrimony may be charitable without merit and Constantine too easily believed that he should purchase the favour of heaven if he maintained the idle at the expence of the industrious and distributed among the saints the wealth of the republic The same messenger who carried over  to Africa the head of Maxentius might be entrusted with an epistle to Caecilian bishop of Carthage The emperor acquaints him that the treasurers of the province are directed to pay into his hands the sum of three thousand  folles  or eighteen thousand pounds sterling and to obey his farther requisitions for the relief of the churches of Africa Numidia and Mauritania  Eusebius Hist Eccles l x in Vit Constantin l iv c He repeatedly expatiates on the liberality of the Christian hero which the bishop himself had an opportunity of knowing and even of tasting  The liberality of Constantine encreased in a just proportion to his faith and to his vices He assigned in each city a regular allowance of corn to supply the fund of ecclesiastical charity and the persons of both sexes who embraced the monastic life became the peculiar favourites of their sovereign The Christian temples of Antioch Alexandria Jerusalem Constantinople c displayed the ostentatious piety of a prince ambitious in a declining age to equal the perfect labours of antiquity  Eusebius Hist Eccles l x c The bishop of Caesarea who studied and gratified the taste of his master pronounced in public an elaborate description of the church of Jerusalem in Vit Cons l iv c It no longer exists but he has inserted in the life of Constantine l iii c a short account of the architecture and ornaments He likewise mentions the church of the holy Apostles at Constantinople l iv c  The form of these religious edifices was simple and oblong though they might sometimes swell into the shape of a dome and sometimes branch into the figure of a cross The timbers were framed for the most part of cedars of Libanus the roof was covered  with tiles perhaps of gilt brass and the walls the columns the pavement were incrusted with variegated marbles The most precious ornaments of gold and silver of silk and gems were profusely dedicated to the service of the altar and this specious magnificence was supported on the solid and perpetual basis of landed property In the space of two centuries from the reign of Constantine to that of Justinian the eighteen hundred churches of the empire were enriched by the frequent and unalienable gifts of the prince and people An annual income of six hundred pounds sterling may be reasonably assigned to the bishops who were placed at an equal distance between riches and poverty  See Justinian Novell cxxiii The revenue of the patriarchs and the most wealthy bishops is not expressed the highest annual valuation of a bishopric is stated at  thirty  and the lowest at  two  pounds of gold the medium might be taken at  sixteen  but these valuations are much below the real value  but the standard of their wealth insensibly rose with the dignity and opulence of the cities which they governed An authentic but imperfect  See Baronius Annal Eccles A D No Every record which comes from the Vatican is justly suspected yet these rentrolls have an ancient and authentic colour and it is at least evident that if forged they were forged in a period when  farms'  not  kingdoms  were the objects of papal avarice  rentroll specifies some houses shops gardens and farms which belonged to the three  Basilicae  of Rome St Peter St Paul and St John Lateran in the provinces of Italy Africa and the East They produce besides a reserved rent of oil linen paper aromatics c a clear annual revenue of twentytwo thousand pieces of gold or twelve thousand  pounds sterling In the age of Constantine and Justinian the bishops no longer possessed perhaps they no longer deserved the unsuspecting confidence of their clergy and people The ecclesiastical revenues of each diocese were divided into four parts for the respective uses of the bishop himself of his inferior clergy of the poor and of the public worship and the abuse of this sacred trust was strictly and repeatedly checked  See Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom iii l ii c p The legal division of the ecclesiastical revenue does not appear to have been established in the time of Ambrose and Chrysostom Simplicius and Gelasius who were bishops of Rome in the latter part of the fifth century mention it in their pastoral letters as a general law which was already confirmed by the custom of Italy  The patrimony of the church was still subject to all the public impositions of the state  Ambrose the most strenuous asserter of ecclesiastical privileges submits without a murmur to the payment of the land tax  Si tributum petit Imperator non negamus agri ecclesiae solvunt tributum solvimus quae sunt Caesaris Caesari quae sunt Dei Deo tributum Caesaris est non negatur  Baronius labours to interpret this tribute as an act of charity rather than of duty Annal Eccles A D but the words if not the intentions of Ambrose are more candidly explained by Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom iii l i c p  The clergy of Rome Alexandria Thessalonica c might solicit and obtain some partial exemptions but the premature attempt of the great council of Rimini which aspired to universal freedom was successfully resisted by the son of Constantine  In Ariminense synodo super ecclesiarum clericorum privilegiis tractatû habito usque eo dispositio progressa est ut juga quae viderentur ad ecclesiam pertinere a publicâ functione cessarent inquietudine desistente quod nostra videtur dudum sanctio repulsisse Cod Theod l xvi tit ii leg Had the synod of Rimini carried this point such practical merit might have atoned for some speculative heresies    IV The Latin clergy who erected their tribunal on the ruins of the civil and common law have modestly accepted as the gift of Constantine  From Eusebius in Vit Constant l iv c and Sozomen l i c we are assured that the episcopal jurisdiction was extended and confirmed by Constantine but the forgery of a famous edict which was never fairly inserted in the Theodosian code see at the end tom vi p is demonstrated by Godefroy in the most satisfactory manner It is strange that M de Montesquieu who was a lawyer as well as a philosopher should allege this edict of Constantine Esprit des Loix l xxix c without intimating any suspicion    IV Civil jurisdiction  the independent jurisdiction which was the fruit of time of accident and of their own industry But the liberality of the Christian emperors had actually endowed them with some legal prerogatives which secured and dignified the sacerdotal character  The subject of ecclesiastical jurisdiction has been involved in a mist of passion of prejudice and of interest Two of the fairest books which have fallen into my hands are the Institutes of Canon Law by the Abbé de Fleury and the Civil History of Naples by Giannone Their moderation was the effect of situation as well as of temper Fleury was a French ecclesiastic who respected the authority of the parliaments Giannone was an Italian lawyer who dreaded the power of the church And here let me observe that as the general propositions which I advance are the result  many  particular and imperfect facts I must either refer the reader to those modern authors who have expressly treated the subject or swell these notes to a disagreeable and disproportioned size  Under a despotic government the bishops alone enjoyed and asserted the inestimable privilege of being tried only by their  peers  and even in a capital accusation a synod of their brethren were the sole judges of their guilt or innocence Such a tribunal  unless it was inflamed by personal resentment or religious discord might be favourable or even partial to the sacerdotal order but Constantine was satisfied  Tillemont has collected from Rufinus Theodoret c the sentiments and language of Constantine Mem Eccles tom iii p  that secret impunity would be less pernicious than public scandal and the Nicene council was edified by his public declaration that if he surprised a bishop in the act of adultery he should cast his Imperial mantle over the episcopal sinner The domestic jurisdiction of the bishops was at once a privilege and a restraint of the ecclesiastical order whose civil causes were decently withdrawn from the cognizance of a secular judge Their venial offences were not exposed to the shame of a public trial or punishment and the gentle correction which the tenderness of youth may endure from its parents or instructors was inflicted by the temperate severity of the bishops But if the clergy were guilty of any crime which could not be sufficiently expiated by their degradation from an honourable and beneficial profession the Roman magistrate drew the sword of justice without any regard to ecclesiastical immunities The arbitration of the bishops was ratified by a positive law and the judges were instructed to execute without appeal or delay the episcopal decrees whose validity had hitherto depended on the consent of the parties The conversion of the magistrates themselves and of the whole empire might gradually remove the fears and scruples of the Christians  But they still resorted to the tribunal of the bishops whose abilities and integrity they esteemed and the venerable Austin enjoyed the satisfaction of complaining that his spiritual functions were perpetually interrupted by the invidious labour of deciding the claim or the possession of silver and gold of lands and cattle The ancient privilege of sanctuary was transferred to the Christian temples and extended by the liberal piety of the younger Theodosius to the precincts of consecrated ground  See Cod Theod l ix tit xlv leg In the works of Fra Paolo tom iv p c there is an excellent discourse on the origin claims abuses and limits of sanctuaries He justly observes that ancient Greece might perhaps contain fifteen or twenty  azyla  or sanctuaries a number which at present may be found in Italy within the walls of a single city  The fugitive and even guilty suppliants were permitted to implore either the justice or the mercy of the Deity and his ministers The rash violence of despotism was suspended by the mild interposition of the church and the lives or fortunes of the most eminent subjects might be protected by the mediation of the bishop  V The bishop was the perpetual censor of the  V Spiritual censures  morals of his people The discipline of penance was digested into a system of canonical jurisprudence  The penitential jurisprudence was continually improved by the canons of the councils But as many cases were still left to the discretion of the bishops they occasionally published after the example of the Roman Praetor the rules of discipline which they proposed to observe Among the canonical epistles of the fourth century those of Basil the Great were the most celebrated They are inserted in the Pandects of Beveridge tom ii p and are translated by Chardon Hist des Sacremens tom iv p  which accurately defined the duty of  private or public confession the rules of evidence the degrees of guilt and the measure of punishment It was impossible to execute this spiritual censure if the Christian pontiff who punished the obscure sins of the multitude respected the conspicuous vices and destructive crimes of the magistrate but it was impossible to arraign the conduct of the magistrate without controuling the administration of civil government Some considerations of religion or loyalty or fear protected the sacred persons of the emperors from the zeal or resentment of the bishops but they boldly censured and excommunicated the subordinate tyrants who were not invested with the majesty of the purple St Athanasius excommunicated one of the ministers of Egypt and the interdict which he pronounced of fire and water was solemnly transmitted to the churches of Cappadocia  Basil Epistol xlvii in Baronius Annal Eccles A D No who declares that he purposely relates it to convince governors that they were not exempt from a sentence of excommunication In his opinion even a royal head is not safe from the thunders of the Vatican and the cardinal shews himself much more consistent than the lawyers and theologians of the Gallican church  Under the reign of the younger Theodosius the polite and eloquent Synesius one of the descendants of Hercules  The long series of his ancestors as high as Eurysthenes the first Doric king of Sparta and the fifth in lineal descent from Hercules was inscribed in the public registers of Cyrene a Lacedaemonian colony Synes Epist lvii p edit Petav Such a pure and illustrious pedigree of seventeen hundred years without adding the royal ancestors of Hercules cannot be equalled in the history of mankind  filled the episcopal seat of Ptolemais  near the ruins of ancient Cyrene  Synesius de Regno p pathetically deplores the fallen and ruined state of Cyrene  Ptolemais a new city miles to the westward of Cyrene assumed the Metropolitan honours of the Pentapolis or Upper Libya which were afterward transferred to Sozusa See Wesseling Itinerar p Cellarius Geograph tom ii part ii p Carolus a St Paulo Geograph Sacra p d'Anville Geographie ancienne tom iii p Memoires de l'Acad des Inscriptions tom xxxvii p  and the philosophic bishop supported with dignity the character which he had assumed with reluctance  Synesius had previously represented his own disqualifications Epist c v p He loved profane studies and profane sports he was incapable of supporting a life of celibacy he disbelieved the resurrection and he refused to preach  fables  to the people unless he might be permitted to  philosophize  at home Theophilus primate of Egypt who knew his merit accepted this extraordinary compromise See the life of Synesius in Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xii p  He vanquished the monster of Libya the president Andronicus who abused the authority of a venal office invented new modes of rapine and torture and aggravated the guilt of oppression by that of sacrilege  See the invective of Synesius Epist lvii p The promotion of Andronicus was illegal since he was a native of Berenice in the same province The instruments of tortures are curiously specified the  or press the  the  the  the  and the  that variously pressed or distended the fingers the feet the nose the ears and the lips of the victims  After a fruitless attempt to reclaim the haughty magistrate by mild and religious admonition Synesius proceeds to inflict the last sentence of ecclesiastical justice  The sentence of excommunication is expressed in a rhetorical style Synesius Epist lviii p The method of involving whole families though somewhat unjust was improved into national interdicts  which  devotes Andronicus with his associates and their  families  to the abhorrence of earth and heaven The impenitent sinners more cruel than Phalaris or Sennacherib more destructive than war pestilence or a cloud of locusts are deprived of the name and privileges of Christians of the participation of the sacraments and of the hope of Paradise The bishop exhorts the clergy the magistrates and the people to renounce all society with the enemies of Christ to exclude them from their houses and tables and to refuse them the common offices of life and the decent rites of burial The church of Ptolemais obscure and contemptible as she may appear addresses this declaration to all her sister churches of the world and the profane who reject her decrees will be involved in the guilt and punishment of Andronicus and his impious followers These spiritual terrors were enforced by a dexterous application to the Byzantine court the trembling president implored the mercy of the church and the descendant of Hercules enjoyed the satisfaction of raising a prostrate tyrant from the ground  See Synesius Epist xlvii p Epist lxxil p Epist lxxxix p  Such principles and such examples insensibly prepared the triumph of the Roman pontiffs who have trampled on the necks of kings  VI Every popular government has experienced  VI Freedom of public preaching  the effects of rude or artificial eloquence The coldest nature is animated the firmest reason is moved by the rapid communication of the prevailing impulse  and each hearer is affected by his own passions and by those of the surrounding multitude The ruin of civil liberty had silenced the demagogues of Athens and the tribunes of Rome the custom of preaching which seems to constitute a considerable part of Christian devotion had not been introduced into the temples of antiquity and the ears of monarchs were never invaded by the harsh sound of popular eloquence till the pulpits of the empire were filled with sacred orators who possessed some advantages unknown to their profane predecessors  See Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom ii l iii c p and Bingham Antiquities vol i l xiv c p Preaching was considered as the most important office of the bishop but this function was sometimes intrusted to such presbyters as Chrysostom and Augustin  The arguments and rhetoric of the tribune were instantly opposed with equal arms by skilful and resolute antagonists and the cause of truth and reason might derive an accidental support from the conflict of hostile passions The bishop or some distinguished presbyter to whom he cautiously delegated the powers of preaching harangued without the danger of interruption or reply a submissive multitude whose minds had been prepared and subdued by the awful ceremonies of religion Such was the strict subordination of the catholic church that the same concerted sounds might issue at once from an hundred pulpits of Italy or Egypt if they were  tuned  Queen Elizabeth used this expression and practised this art whenever she wished to prepossess the minds of her people in favour of any extraordinary measure of government The hostile effects of this  music  were apprehended by her successor and severely felt by his son "When pulpit drum ecclesiastic c" See Heylin's Life of Archbishop Laud p  by the master hand of the Roman or  Alexandrian primate The design of this institution was laudable but the fruits were not always salutary The preachers recommended the practice of the social duties but they exalted the perfection of monastic virtue which is painful to the individual and useless to mankind Their charitable exhortations betrayed a secret wish that the clergy might be permitted to manage the wealth of the faithful for the benefit of the poor The most sublime representations of the attributes and laws of the Deity were sullied by an idle mixture of metaphysical subtleties puerile rites and fictitious miracles and they expatiated with the most fervent zeal on the religious merit of hating the adversaries and obeying the ministers of the church When the public peace was distracted by heresy and schism the sacred orators sounded the trumpet of discord and perhaps of sedition The understandings of their congregations were perplexed by mystery their passions were inflamed by invectives and they rushed from the Christian temples of Antioch or Alexandria prepared either to suffer or to inflict martyrdom The corruption of taste and language is strongly marked in the vehement declamations of the Latin bishops but the compositions of Gregory and Chrysostom have been compared with the most splendid models of Attic or at least of Asiatic eloquence  Those modest orators acknowledged that as they were destitute of the gift of miracles they endeavoured to acquire the arts of eloquence    VII The representatives of the Christian republic were regularly assembled in the spring and autumn of each year and these synods diffused  VII Privilege of legislative assemblies  the spirit of ecclesiastical discipline and legislation through the hundred and twenty provinces of the Roman world  The Council of Nice in the fourth fifth sixth and seventh canons has made some fundamental regulations concerning synods metropolitans and primates The Nicene canons have been variously tortured abused interpolated or forged according to the interest of the clergy The  Suburbicarian  churches assigned by Rufinus to the bishop of Rome have been made the subject of vehement controversy See Sirmond Opera tom iv p  The archbishop or metropolitan was empowered by the laws to summon the suffragan bishops of his province to revise their conduct to vindicate their rights to declare their faith and to examine the merit of the candidates who were elected by the clergy and people to supply the vacancies of the episcopal college The primates of Rome Alexandria Antioch Carthage and afterwards Constantinople who exercised a more ample jurisdiction convened the numerous assembly of their dependent bishops But the convocation of great and extraordinary synods was the prerogative of the emperor alone Whenever the emergencies of the church required this decisive measure he dispatched a peremptory summons to the bishops or the deputies of each province with an order for the use of posthorses and a competent allowance for the expences of their journey At an early period when Constantine was the protector rather than the proselyte  A D  of Christianity he referred the African controversy to the council of Arles in which the bishops of York of Treves of Milan and of  Carthage met as friends and brethren to debate in their native tongue on the common interest of the Latin or Western church  We have only thirtythree or fortyseven episcopal subscriptions but Ado a writer indeed of small account reckons six hundred bishops in the council of Arles Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vi p  Eleven years afterwards a more numerous and celebrated  A D  assembly was convened at Nice in Bithynia to extinguish by their final sentence the subtle disputes which had arisen in Egypt on the subject of the Trinity Three hundred and eighteen bishops obeyed the summons of their indulgent master the ecclesiastics of every rank and sect and denomination have been computed at two thousand and fortyeight persons  See Tillemont tom vi p and Beausobre Hist du Manicheisme tom i p The name of  bishop  which is given by Eutychius to the ecclesiastics Annal tom i p vers Pocock must be extended far beyond the limits of an orthodox or even episcopal ordination  the Greeks appeared in person and the consent of the Latins was expressed by the legates of the Roman pontiff The session which lasted about two months was frequently honoured by the presence of the emperor Leaving his guards at the door he seated himself with the permission of the council on a low stool in the midst of the hall Constantine listened with patience and spoke with modesty and while he influenced the debates he humbly professed that he was the minister not the judge of the successors of the apostles who had been established as priests and as gods upon earth  See Euseb in Vit Constantin l iii c Tillemont Mem Ecclesiastiques tom vi p  Such profound reverence of an absolute  monarch towards a feeble and unarmed assembly of his own subjects can only be compared to the respect with which the senate had been treated by the Roman princes who adopted the policy of Augustus Within the space of fifty years a philosophic spectator of the vicissitudes of human affairs might have contemplated Tacitus in the senate of Rome and Constantine in the council of Nice The fathers of the capitol and those of the church had alike degenerated from the virtues of their founders but as the bishops were more deeply rooted in the public opinion they sustained their dignity with more decent pride and sometimes opposed with a manly spirit the wishes of their sovereign The progress of time and superstition erazed the memory of the weakness the passion the ignorance which disgraced these ecclesiastical synods and the Catholic world has unanimously submitted  Sancimus igitur vicem legum obtinere quae a quatuor Sanctis Conciliis expositae sunt aut firmatae Praedictarum enim quatuor synodorum dogmata sicut sanctas Scripturas et regulas

Persecution of HeresyThe Schism of the DonatistsThe Arian ControversyAthanasiusDistracted State of the Church and Empire under Constantine and his SonsToleration of Paganism  THE grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest Constantine gave them security wealth honours and revenge and the support of the orthodox faith was considered as the most sacred and important duty of the civil magistrate The edict of Milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the Roman world the privilege of chusing and professing his own religion But this inestimable privilege was soon violated with the knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution and the sects which dissented from the Catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of Christianity Constantine easily believed that the Heretics who presumed to dispute  his  opinions or to oppose  his  commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation Not a moment was lost in excluding the ministers and teachers of the separated congregations from any share of the rewards and immunities which the emperor had  so liberally bestowed on the orthodox clergy But as the sectaries might still exist under the cloud of royal disgrace the conquest of the East was immediately followed by an edict which announced their total destruction  Eusebius in Vit Constantin l iii c  After a preamble filled with passion and reproach Constantine absolutely prohibits the assemblies of the Heretics and confiscates their public property to the use either of the revenue or of the Catholic church The sects against whom the Imperial severity was directed appear to have been the adherents of Paul of Samosata the Montanists of Phrygia who maintained an enthusiastic succession of prophecy the Novatians who sternly rejected the temporal efficacy of repentance the Marcionites and Valentinians under whose leading banners the various Gnostics of Asia and Egypt had insensibly rallied and perhaps the Manichaeans who had recently imported from Persia a more artful composition of Oriental and Christian theology  After some examination of the various opinions of Tillemont Beausobre Lardner c I am convinced that Manes did not propagate his sect even in Persia before the year It is strange that a philosophic and foreign heresy should have penetrated so rapidly into the African provinces yet I cannot easily reject the edict of Diocletian against the Manichaeans which may be found in Baronius Annal Eccl A D  The design of extirpating the name or at least of restraining the progress of these odious Heretics was prosecuted with vigour and effect Some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of Diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded  by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and had pleaded for the rights of humanity Two immaterial circumstances may serve however to prove that the mind of Constantine was not entirely corrupted by the spirit of zeal and bigotry Before he condemned the Manichaeans and their kindred sects he resolved to make an accurate enquiry into the nature of their religious principles As if he distrusted the impartiality of his ecclesiastical counsellors this delicate commission was entrusted to a civil magistrate whose learning and moderation he justly esteemed and of whose venal character he was probably ignorant  Constantinus enim cum limatius superstitionum quaereret sectas Manichaeorum et similium c Ammian xv Strategius who from this commission obtained the surname of  Musonianus  was a Christian of the Arian sect He acted as one of the counts at the council of Sardica Libanius praises his mildness and prudence Vales ad locum Ammian  The emperor was soon convinced that he had too hastily proscribed the orthodox faith and the exemplary morals of the Novatians who had dissented from the church in some articles of discipline which were not perhaps essential to salvation By a particular edict he exempted them from the general penalties of the law  Cod Theod l xvi tit v leg As the general law is not inserted in the Theodosian code it is probable

Most of the Christian sects have by turns borrowed the ladder of Acesius    The complaints and mutual accusations which  African controversy  assailed the throne of Constantine as soon as the death of

by M Dupin who has enriched it with critical notes geographical discussions original records and an accurate abridgement of the whole controversy M de Tillemont has bestowed on the Donatists the greatest part of a volume tom vi part i and I am indebted to him for an ample collection of all the passages of his favourite St Augustin which relate to those heretics  The source of the division was derived from a double election in the church of Carthage the second in rank and opulence of the ecclesiastical thrones of the West Caecilian and Majorinus were the two rival primates of Africa and the death of the latter soon made room for Donatus who by his superior abilities and apparent virtues was the firmest support of his party The advantage which Caecilian might claim from the priority of his ordination was destroyed by the illegal or at least indecent haste with which it had been performed without expecting the arrival of the  bishops of Numidia The authority of these bishops who to the number of seventy condemned Caecilian and consecrated Majorinus is again weakened by the infamy of some of their personal characters and by the female intrigues sacrilegious bargains and tumultuous proceedings which are imputed to this Numidian council  Schisma igitur illo tempore confusae mulieris iracundia peperit ambitus nutrivit avaritia roboravit Optatus l i c The language of

head by way of penance  Optat l i c  The bishops of the contending factions maintained with equal ardour and obstinacy that their adversaries were degraded or at least dishonoured by the odious crime of delivering the Holy Scriptures to the officers of Diocletian From their mutual reproaches as well as from the story of this dark transaction it may justly be inferred that the late persecution had embittered the zeal without reforming the manners of the African Christians That divided church was incapable of affording an impartial judicature the controversy was solemnly tried in five successive tribunals which were appointed by the emperor and the whole proceeding from the first appeal to the final sentence lasted above three years A severe inquisition which was taken by the Praetorian vicar and the proconsul of Africa the report of two episcopal visitors who had been sent  to Carthage the decrees of the councils of Rome and of Arles and the supreme judgment of Constantine himself in his sacred consistory were all favourable to the cause of Caecilian and he was unanimously acknowledged by the civil and ecclesiastical powers as the true and lawful primate of Africa The honours and estates of the church were attributed to  his  suffragan bishops and it was not without difficulty that Constantine was satisfied with inflicting the punishment of exile on the principal leaders of the Donatist faction As their cause was examined with attention perhaps it was determined with justice Perhaps their complaint was not without foundation that the credulity of the emperor had been abused by the insidious arts of his favourite Osius The influence of falsehood and corruption might procure the condemnation of the innocent or aggravate the sentence of the guilty Such an act however of injustice if it concluded an importunate dispute might be numbered among the transient evils of a despotic administration which are neither felt nor remembered by posterity  But this incident so inconsiderable that it  Schism of the Donatists  scarcely deserves a place in history was productive of a memorable schism which afflicted the provinces  A D  of Africa above three hundred years and was extinguished only with Christianity itself The inflexible zeal of freedom and fanaticism animated the Donatists to refuse obedience to the usurpers whose election they disputed and whose spiritual powers they denied Excluded from the civil and religious communion of mankind  they boldly excommunicated the rest of mankind who had embraced the impious party of Caecilian and of the Traditors from whom he derived his pretended ordination They asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the Apostolical succession was interrupted that  all  the bishops of Europe and Asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the prerogatives of the Catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the African believers who alone had preserved inviolate the integrity of their faith and discipline This rigid theory was supported by the most uncharitable conduct Whenever they acquired a proselyte even from the distant provinces of the East they carefully repeated the sacred rites of baptism  The councils of Arles of Nice and of Trent confirmed the wise and moderate practice of the church of Rome The Donatists however had the advantage of maintaining the sentiment of Cyprian and of a considerable part of the primitive church Vincentius Lirinensis p ap Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vi p has explained why the Donatists are eternally burning with the Devil while St Cyprian reigns in heaven with Jesus Christ  and ordination as they rejected the validity of those which he had already received from the hands of heretics or schismatics Bishops virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the Donatists If they obtained possession of a church which had been used by their Catholic adversaries they purified the unhallowed building with the same jealous care which a temple of Idols might have required They washed the pavement scraped the walls  burnt the altar which was commonly of wood melted the consecrated plate and cast the Holy Eucharist to the dogs with every circumstance of ignominy which could provoke and perpetuate the animosity of religious factions  See the sixth book of Optatus Milevitanus p  Notwithstanding this irreconcilable aversion the two parties who were mixed and separated in all the cities of Africa had the same language and manners the same zeal and learning the same faith and worship Proscribed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the empire the Donatists still maintained in some provinces particularly in Numidia their superior numbers and four hundred bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate But the invincible spirit of the sect sometimes preyed on its own vitals and the bosom of their schismatical church was torn by intestine divisions A fourth part of the Donatist bishops followed the independent standard of the Maximianists The narrow and solitary path which their first leaders had marked out continued to deviate from the great society of mankind Even the imperceptible sect of the Rogatians could affirm without a blush that when Christ should descend to judge the earth he would find his true religion preserved only in a few nameless villages of the Caesarean Mauritania  Tillemont Mem Ecclesiastiques tom vi part i p He laughs at their partial cruelty He revered Augustin

Deity When he had elevated his mind to the sublime contemplation of the first selfexistent necessary cause of the universe the Athenian sage was incapable of conceiving  how  the simple unity of his essence could  admit the infinite variety of distinct and successive ideas which compose the model of the intellectual world  how  a Being purely incorporeal could execute that perfect model and mould with a plastic hand the rude and independent chaos The vain hope of extricating himself from these difficulties which must ever oppress the feeble powers of the human mind might induce Plato to consider the divine nature under the threefold modification of the first cause the reason or  Logos  and the soul or spirit of the universe  The LOGOS  His poetical imagination sometimes fixed and animated these metaphysical abstractions the three  archical  or original principles were represented in the Platonic system as three Gods united with each other by a mysterious and ineffable generation and the Logos was particularly considered under the more accessible character of the Son of an Eternal Father and the Creator and Governor of the world Such appear to have been the secret doctrines which were cautiously whispered in the gardens of the academy and which according to the more recent disciples of Plato could not be perfectly understood till after an assiduous study of

pretended that the imperfections of matter are incompatible with the purity of a celestial substance While the blood of Christ yet smoked on Mount Calvary the Docetes invented the impious and extravagant hypothesis that instead of issuing from the womb of the Virgin  Non dignum est ex utero credere Deum et Deum Christum non dignum est ut tanta majestas per sordes et squalores mulieris

disciples was satisfied with the science of words But the most sagacious of the Christian theologians the great Athanasius himself has candidly confessed  Athanasius tom i p His expressions have an uncommon energy and as he was writing to Monks there could not be any occasion for him to  effect  a rational language  that whenever he forced his understanding to meditate on the divinity of the  Logos  his toilsome and unavailing efforts recoiled on themselves that the more he thought the less he comprehended and the more he wrote the less capable was he of expressing his thoughts In every step of the enquiry we are compelled to feel and acknowledge the immeasurable disproportion between the size of the object and the capacity of the human mind We may strive to abstract the notions of time of space and of matter which so closely adhere to all the perceptions of our experimental knowledge But as soon as we presume to reason of infinite substance of spiritual generation as often as we deduce any positive conclusions from a negative idea we are involved in darkness perplexity and inevitable contradiction As these difficulties arise from the nature of the subject they oppress with the same insuperable weight the philosophic and the theological disputant but we may observe two essential and peculiar circumstances which discriminated the doctrines of the Catholic church from the opinions of the Platonic school  I A chosen society of philosophers men of a  Law  of the Christians  liberal education and curious disposition might  silently meditate and temperately discuss in the gardens of Athens or the library of Alexandria the abstruse questions of metaphysical science The lofty speculations which neither convinced the understanding nor agitated the passions of the Platonists themselves were carelessly overlooked by the idle the busy and even the studious part of mankind  In a treatise which professed to explain the opinions of the ancient philosophers concerning the nature of the gods we might expect to discover the theological Trinity of Plato But Cicero very honestly confessed that though he had translated the  could never understand that mysterious  praef ad l xii in Isaiam tom v p  But after the  Logos  had been revealed as the sacred object of the faith the hope and the religious worship of the Christians the mysterious system was embraced by a numerous and increasing multitude in every province of the Roman world Those persons who from their age or sex or occupations were the least qualified to judge who were the least exercised in the habits of abstract reasoning aspired to contemplate the oeconomy of the Divine Nature and it is the boast of Tertullian  Tertullian in Apolog c  Simonide  His remarks on the  profound

the highest and the lowest of human understandings may indeed be calculated as infinitely small yet the degree of weakness may perhaps be measured by the degree of obstinacy and dogmatic confidence These speculations  instead of being treated as the amusement of a vacant hour became the most serious business of the present and the most useful preparation for a future life A theology which it was incumbent to believe which it was impious to doubt and which it might be dangerous and even fatal to mistake became the familiar topic of private meditation and popular discourse The cold indifference of philosophy was inflamed by the fervent spirit of devotion and even the metaphors of common language suggested the fallacious prejudices of sense and experience The Christians who abhorred the gross and impure generation of the Greek mythology  Lactantius iv Yet the  Probole  or  Prolatio  which the most orthodox divines borrowed without scruple from the Valentinians and illustrated by the

familiar analogy of the filial and paternal relations The character of  Son  seemed to imply a perpetual subordination to the voluntary author of his existence  Many of the primitive writers have frankly confessed that the Son owed his being to the  will  of the Father See Clarke's Scripture Trinity p On the other hand Athanasius and his followers seem unwilling to grant what they are afraid to deny The schoolmen extricate themselves from this difficulty by the distinction of a  preceding  and a  concomitant  will Petav Dogm Theolog tom ii l vi c p  but as the act of generation in the

his divine honours have been perpetuated in every age and country by the various sects who assume the name of his disciples  Carmenque Christo quasi Deo dicere secum invicem Plin Epist x The sense of

Their tender reverence for the memory of Christ and their horror for the profane worship of any created being would have engaged them to assert the equal and absolute divinity of the  Logos  if their rapid ascent towards the throne of heaven had not been imperceptibly checked by the apprehension of violating the unity and sole supremacy of the great Father of Christ and of the Universe The suspense and fluctuation produced in the minds of the Christians by these opposite tendencies may be observed in the writings of the theologians who flourished after the end of the apostolic age and before the origin of the Arian controversy Their suffrage is claimed with equal confidence by the orthodox and by the heretical parties and the most inquisitive critics have fairly allowed that if they had the good fortune of possessing the Catholic verity they have delivered their conceptions in loose  inaccurate and sometimes contradictory language  See Daillé de Usu Patrum and Le Clerc

the minds of the faithful The loose wanderings of the imagination were gradually confined by creeds and confessions  The most ancient creeds were drawn up with the greatest latitude See Bull Judicium Eccles Cathol who tries to prevent Episcopius from deriving any advantage from this observation  the freedom of private judgment submitted to the public wisdom of synods the authority of a theologian was determined by his ecclesiastical rank and the episcopal successors of the apostles inflicted the censures of the church on those who deviated from the orthodox belief But in an age of religious controversy every act of oppression adds new force to the elastic vigour of the mind and the zeal or obstinacy of a spiritual rebel was sometimes stimulated by secret motives of ambition or  avarice A metaphysical argument became the cause or pretence of political contests the subtleties of the Platonic school were used as the badges  Factions  of popular factions and the distance which separated their respective tenets was enlarged or magnified by the acrimony of dispute As long as the dark heresies of Praxeas and Sabellius laboured to confound the  Father  with the  Son  The heresies of Praxeas Sabellius c are accurately explained by Mosheim p Praxeas who came to Rome about the end of the second century deceived for some time the simplicity of the bishop and was confuted by the pen of the angry Tertullian  the orthodox party might be excused if they adhered more strictly and more earnestly to the  distinction  than to the  equality  of the divine persons But as soon as the heat of controversy had subsided and the progress of the Sabellians was no longer an object of terror to the churches of Rome of Africa or of Egypt the tide of theological opinion began to flow with a gentle but steady motion toward the contrary extreme and the most orthodox doctors allowed themselves the use of the terms and definitions which had been censured in the mouth of the sectaries  Socrates acknowledges that the heresy of Arius proceeded from his strong desire to embrace an opinion the most diametrically opposite to that of Sabellius  After the edict of toleration had restored peace and leisure to the Christians the Trinitarian controversy was revived in the ancient seat of Platonism the learned the opulent the tumultuous city of Alexandria and the flame of religious

appeared to support or favour his cause and their measures were conducted by Eusebius of Caesarea the most learned of the Christian prelates and by Eusebius of Nicomedia who had acquired the reputation of a statesman without forfeiting that of a saint Synods in Palestine and Bithynia were opposed to the synods of Egypt The attention of the prince and people was attracted by this

archangels yet he shone only with a reflected light and like the sons of the Roman emperors who were invested with the titles of Caesar or Augustus  This prophane and absurd simile is employed by several of the primitive fathers particularly by Athenagoras in his Apology to the emperor Marcus and his son and it is alleged without censure by Bull himself See Defens Fid Nicen f iii c No  he governed the universe in obedience to the will of his Father and Monarch II In the second hypothesis the  Logos  Tritheism  possessed all the inherent incommunicable perfections which religion and philosophy appropriate to the Supreme God Three distinct and infinite minds or substances three coequal and coeternal beings composed the Divine Essence  See Cudworth's Intellectual System p This dangerous hypothesis was countenanced by the two Gregories of Nyssa and Nazianzen by Cyril of Alexandria John of Damascus c See Cudworth p Le Clerc Bibliotheque Universelle tom xviii p    and it would have implied contradiction that any of them should not have existed or that they should ever cease to exist  Augustin seems to envy the freedom of the philosophers Liberis verbis loquuntur philosophi Nos autem non dicimus duo vel tria principia duos vel tres Deos De Civitat Dei x  The advocates of a system which seemed to establish three independent Deities attempted to preserve the unity of the First Cause so conspicuous in the design and order of the world by the perpetual concord of their administration and the essential agreement of their will A faint resemblance of this unity of action may be discovered in the societies of men and even of animals The causes which disturb their harmony proceed only from the imperfection and inequality of their faculties but the omnipotence which is guided by infinite wisdom and goodness cannot fail of chusing the same means for the accomplishment of the same ends III Three Beings who by the selfderived  Sabellianism  necessity of their existence possess all the divine attributes in the most perfect degree who are eternal in duration infinite in space and intimately present to each other and to the whole universe irresistibly force themselves

See the judicious remarks of Le Clerc Bibliotheque Choisie tom xvi p c  who in the oeconomy of grace as well as in that of  nature may manifest himself under different forms and be considered under different aspects By this hypothesis a real substantial Trinity is refined into a trinity of names and abstract modifications that subsist only in the mind which conceives them The  Logos  is no longer a person but an attribute and it is only in a figurative sense that the epithet of Son can be applied to the eternal reason which was with God from the beginning and by  which  not by  whom  all things were made The incarnation of the  Logos  is reduced to a mere inspiration of the Divine Wisdom which filled the soul and directed all the actions of the man Jesus Thus after revolving round the theological circle we are surprised to find that the Sabellian ends where the Ebionite had begun and that the incomprehensible mystery which excites our adoration eludes our enquiry  If the Sabellians were startled at this conclusion they were driven down another precipice into the confession that the Father was born of a virgin that  he  had suffered on the cross and thus deserved the

charity and moderation urged the incomprehensible nature of the controversy disclaimed the use of any terms of definitions which could not be found in the scriptures and offered by very liberal concessions to satisfy their adversaries without renouncing the integrity of their own principles The victorious faction received all their proposals with haughty suspicion and anxiously sought for some irreconcileable mark of distinction the rejection of which might involve the Arians in the guilt and consequences of heresy A letter was publicly read and ignominiously torn in which their patron Eusebius of Nicomedia ingenuously confessed that the admission of the HOMOOUSION or Consubstantial  The Homoousion  a word already familiar to the Platonists was incompatible with the principles of their theological system The fortunate opportunity was eagerly embraced by the bishops who governed the resolutions of the synod and according to the lively expression of Ambrose  We are indebted to Ambrose de Fide l iii cap ult for the knowledge of this curious anecdote Hoc verbum posuerunt Patres quod viderunt adversariis esse formidini ut tanquam evaginato ab ipsis gladio ipsum nefandae caput heraeseos amputarent  they used the sword  which heresy itself had drawn from the scabbard to cut off the head of the hated monster The consubstantiality of the Father and the Son was established by the council of Nice and has been unanimously received as a fundamental article of the Christian faith by the consent of the Greek the Latin the Oriental and the Protestant churches But if the same word had not served to stigmatize the heretics and to unite the Catholics it would have been inadequate to the purpose of the majority by whom it was introduced into the orthodox creed This majority was divided into two parties distinguished by a contrary tendency to the sentiments of the Tritheists and of the Sabellians But as those opposite extremes seemed to overthrow the foundations either of natural or revealed religion they mutually agreed to qualify the rigour of their principles and to disavow the just but invidious consequences which might be urged by their antagonists The interest of the common cause inclined them to join their numbers and to conceal their differences their animosity was softened by the healing counsels of toleration and their disputes were suspended by the use of the mysterious  Homoousion  which either party was free to interpret according to their peculiar tenets The Sabellian sense which about fifty years before had obliged the council of Antioch  See Bull Defens Fid Nicen sect ii c i p He thinks it his duty to reconcile two orthodox synods  to prohibit  this celebrated term had endeared it to those theologians who entertained a secret but partial affection for a nominal Trinity But the more fashionable saints of the Arian times the intrepid Athanasius the learned Gregory Nazianzen and the other pillars of the church who supported with ability and success the Nicene doctrine appeared to consider the expression of  substance  as if it had been synonimous with that of  nature  and they ventured to illustrate their meaning by affirming that three men as they belong to the same common species are consubstantial or homoousian to each other  According to Aristotle the stars were Homoousian to each other  That  Homoousius  means of one substance in  kind  hath been shewn by Petavius Curcellaeus Cudworth Le Clerc c and to prove it would be  actum agere  This is the just remark of Dr Jortin vol ii p who examines the Arian controversy

preeminence of the Father which was acknowledged as far as it is compatible with the independence of the Son  The third section of Bull's Defence of the Nicene Faith which some of his antagonists have called nonsense and others heresy is consecrated to the supremacy of the Father  Within these limits the almost invisible and tremulous ball of orthodoxy was allowed securely to vibrate On either side beyond this consecrated ground the  heretics and the daemons lurked in ambush to surprise and devour the unhappy wanderer But as the degrees of theological hatred depend on the spirit of the war rather than on the importance of the controversy the heretics who degraded were treated with more severity than those who annihilated the person of the Son The life of Athanasius was consumed in irreconcileable opposition to the impious  madness  of the Arians  The ordinary appellation with which Athanasius and his followers chose to compliment the Arians was that of  Ariomanites  but he defended above twenty years the Sabellianism of Marcellus of Ancyra and when at last he was compelled to withdraw himself from his communion he continued to mention with an ambiguous smile the venial errors of his respectable friend  Epiphanius tom i Haeres lxxii p See the adventures of Marcellus in Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p His work in  one  book of the unity of God was answered in the  three  books which are still extant of Eusebius After a long and careful examination Petavius tom ii l i c p has reluctantly pronounced the condemnation of Marcellus    The authority of a general council to which  Arian creeds  the Arians themselves had been compelled to submit inscribed on the banners of the orthodox party the mysterious characters of the word  Homoousion  which essentially contributed notwithstanding some obscure disputes some nocturnal combats to maintain and perpetuate the uniformity of faith or at least of language The Consubstantialists who by their success have deserved and obtained the title of Catholics gloried in the simplicity and steadiness of their own creed  and insulted the repeated variations of their adversaries who were destitute of any certain rule of faith The sincerity or the cunning of the Arian chiefs the fear of the laws or of the people their reverence for Christ their hatred of Athanasius all the causes human and divine that influence and disturb the counsels of a theological faction introduced among the sectaries a spirit of discord and inconstancy which in the course of a few years erected eighteen different models of religion  Athanasius in his epistle concerning the synods of Seleucia and Rimini tom i p has given an ample list of Arian creeds which has been enlarged and improved by the labours of the indefatigable Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vi p  and avenged the violated dignity of the church The zealous Hilary  Erasmus with admirable sense and freedom has delineated the just character of Hilary To revise his text to compose the annals of his life and to justify his sentiments and conduct is the province of the Benedictine editors  who from the peculiar hardships of his situation was inclined to

would have been surprised in the philosophic society of Bayle and Plutarch  The oppression which he had felt the disorders of which he was the spectator and the victim appeased during a short interval  the angry passions of his soul and in the following passage of which I shall transcribe a few lines the bishop of Poitiers unwarily deviates into the style of a Christian philosopher  It is a thing says Hilary equally deplorable and dangerous that there are as many creeds as opinions among men as many doctrines as inclinations and as many sources of blasphemy as there are faults among us because we make creeds arbitrarily and explain them as arbitrarily The Homoousion is rejected and received and explained away by successive synods The partial or total resemblance of the Father and of the Son is a subject of dispute for these unhappy times Every year nay every moon we make new creeds to describe invisible mysteries We repent of what we have done we defend those who repent we anathematise those whom we defended We condemn either the doctrine of others in ourselves or our own in that of others and reciprocally tearing one another to pieces we have been the cause of each other's ruin  Hilarius ad Constantium l ii c p This remarkable passage deserved the attention of Mr Locke who has transcribed it vol iii p into the model of his new commonplace book    It will not be expected it would not perhaps  Arian sects  be endured that I should swell this theological digression by a minute examination of the eighteen creeds the authors of which for the most part disclaimed the odious name of their parent Arius It is amusing enough to delineate the form and to trace the vegetation of a singular plant but  the tedious detail of leaves without flowers and of branches without fruit would soon exhaust the patience and disappoint the curiosity of the laborious student One question which gradually arose from the Arian controversy may however be noticed as it served to produce and discriminate the three sects who were united only by their common aversion to the Homoousion of the Nicene synod If they were asked whether the Son was  like  unto the Father the question was resolutely answered in the negative by the heretics who adhered to the principles of Arius or indeed to those of philosophy which seem to establish an infinite difference between the Creator and the most excellent of his creatures This obvious consequence was maintained by Aetius  In Philostorgius l iii c the character and adventures of Aetius appear singular enough though they are carefully softened by the hand of a friend The editor Godefroy p who was more attached to his principles than to his author has collected the odious circumstances which his various adversaries have preserved or invented  on whom the zeal of his adversaries bestowed the surname of the Atheist His restless and aspiring spirit urged him to try almost every profession of human life He was successively a slave or at least a husbandman a travelling tinker a goldsmith a physician a schoolmaster a theologian and at last the apostle of a new church which was propagated by the abilities of his disciple Eunomius  According to the judgment of a man who respected both those sectaries Aetius had been endowed with a stronger understanding and Eunomius had acquired more art and learning Philostorgius l viii c The confession and apology of Eunomius Fabricius Bibliot Graec tom viii p is one of the few heretical pieces which have escaped  Armed with texts of scripture and with  captious syllogisms from the logic of Aristotle the subtle Aetius had acquired the fame of an invincible disputant whom it was impossible either to silence or to convince Such talents engaged the friendship of the Arian bishops till they were forced to renounce and even to persecute a dangerous ally who by the accuracy of his reasoning had prejudiced their cause in the popular opinion and offended the piety of their most devoted followers The omnipotence of the Creator suggested a specious and respectful solution of the  likeness  of the Father and the Son and faith might humbly receive what reason could not presume to deny that the Supreme God might communicate his infinite perfections and create a being similar only to himself  Yet according to the opinion of Estius and Bull p there is one power that of creation which God  cannot  communicate to a creature Estius who so accurately defined the limits of Omnipotence was a Dutchman by birth and by trade a scholastic divine Dupin Bibliot Eccles tom xvii p  These Arians were powerfully supported by the weight and abilities of their leaders who had succeeded to the management of the Eusebian interest and who occupied the principal thrones of the East They detested perhaps with some affectation the impiety of Aetius they professed to believe either without reserve or according to the scriptures that the Son was different from all  other  creatures and similar only to the Father But they denied that  he was either of the same or of a similar substance sometimes boldly justifying their dissent and sometimes objecting to the use of the word substance which seems to imply an adequate or at least a distinct notion of the nature of the Deity The sect which asserted the doctrine of a similar substance was the most numerous at least in the provinces of Asia and when the leaders of both parties were assembled in the council of Seleucia  Sabinus ap Socrat l ii c had copied the acts Athanasius and Hilary have explained the divisions of this Arian synod the other circumstances which are relative to it are carefully collected by Baronius and Tillemont    their  opinion would have prevailed by a majority of one hundred and five to fortythree bishops The Greek word which was chosen to express this mysterious resemblance bears so close an affinity to the orthodox symbol that the profane of every age have derided the furious contests which the difference of a single diphthong excited between the Homoousians and the Homoiousians As it frequently happens that the sounds and characters which approach the nearest to each other accidentally represent the most opposite ideas the observation would be itself ridiculous if it were possible to mark any real and sensible distinction between the doctrine of the SemiArians as they were improperly styled and that of the Catholics themselves The bishop of Poitiers who in his Phrygian exile very wisely aimed at a coalition of parties endeavours to prove that by a pious and faithful interpretation  Fideli et piâ intelligentiâDe Synod c p In his short apologetical notes first published by the Benedictines from a MS of Chartres he observes that he used this cautious expression qui intelligerem et impiam p See p Philostorgius who saw those objects through a different medium is inclined to forget the difference of the important diphthong See in particular viii and Godefroy p  the  Homoiousion  may be  reduced to a consubstantial sense Yet he confesses that the word has a dark and suspicious aspect and as if darkness were congenial to theological disputes the SemiArians who advanced to the doors of the church assailed them with the most unrelenting fury  The provinces of Egypt and Asia which cultivated  Faith of the Western or Latin church  the language and manners of the Greeks had deeply imbibed the venom of the Arian controversy The familiar study of the Platonic system a vain and argumentative disposition a copious and flexible idiom supplied the clergy and people of the East with an inexhaustible flow of words and distinctions and in the midst of their fierce contentions they easily forgot the doubt which is recommended by philosophy and the submission which is enjoined by religion The inhabitants of the West were of a less inquisitive spirit their passions were not so forcibly moved by invisible objects their minds were less frequently exercised by the habits of dispute and such was the happy ignorance of the Gallican church that Hilary himself above thirty years after the first general council was still a stranger to the Nicene creed  Testor Deum coeli atque terrae mecum neutrum audissem semper tamen utrumque sensisse Regeneratus pridem in episcopatu aliquantisper manens fidem Nicenam nunquam nisi exsulaturus audivi Hilar de Synodis c xci p The Benedictines are persuaded that he governed the diocese of Poitiers several years before his exile  The Latins had received  the rays of divine knowledge through the dark and doubtful medium of a translation The poverty and stubbornness of their native tongue was not always capable of affording just equivalents for the Greek terms for the technical words of the Platonic philosophy  Seneca Epist lviii complains that even the  of the Platonists the  ens  of the bolder schoolmen could not be expressed by a Latin noun  which had been consecrated by the gospel or by the church to express the mysteries of the Christian faith and a verbal defect might introduce into the Latin theology a long train of error or perplexity  The preference which the fourth council of the Lateran at length gave to a  numerical  rather than a  generical  unity see Petav tom ii l iv c p was favoured by the Latin language  seems to excite the idea of substance  trinitas  of qualities  But as the western provincials had the good fortune of deriving their religion from an orthodox source they preserved with steadiness the doctrine which they had accepted with docility and when the Arian pestilence approached their frontiers they were supplied with the seasonable preservative of the Homoousion by the paternal care of the Roman pontiff Their sentiments and their temper were displayed in the memorable synod of  Council of Rimini  Rimini which surpassed in numbers the council  A D  of Nice since it was composed of above four hundred bishops of Italy Africa Spain Gaul Britain and Illyricum From the first debates it appeared that only fourscore prelates adhered to the party though  they  affected to anathematise the name and memory of Arius But this inferiority was compensated by the advantages of skill of experience  and of discipline and the minority was conducted by Valens and Ursacius two bishops of Illyricum who had spent their lives in the intrigues of courts and councils and who had been trained under the Eusebian banner in the religious wars of the East By their arguments and negociations they embarrassed they confounded they at last deceived the honest simplicity of the Latin bishops who suffered the palladium of the faith to be extorted from their hands by fraud and importunity rather than by open violence The council of Rimini was not allowed to separate till the members had imprudently subscribed a captious creed in which some expressions susceptible of an heretical sense were inserted in the room of the Homoousion It was on this occasion that according to Jerom the world was surprised to find itself Arian  Ingemuit totus orbis et Arianum se esse miratus est Hieronym adv Lucifer tom i p  But the bishops of the Latin provinces had no sooner reached their respective dioceses than they discovered their mistake and repented of their weakness The ignominious capitulation was rejected with disdain and abhorrence and the Homoousian standard which had been shaken but not overthrown was more firmly replanted in all the churches of the West  The story of the council of Rimini is very elegantly told by Sulpicius Severus Hist Sacra l ii p edit Lugd Bat and by Jerom in his dialogue against the Luciferians The design of the latter is to apologize for the conduct of the Latin bishops who were deceived and who repented    Such was the rise and progress and such were  Conduct of the emperors in the Arian controversy  the natural revolutions of those theological disputes  which disturbed the peace of Christianity under the reigns of Constantine and of his sons But as those princes presumed to extend their despotism over the faith as well as over the lives and fortunes of their subjects the weight of their suffrage sometimes inclined the ecclesiastical balance and the prerogatives of the King of Heaven were settled or changed or modified in the cabinet of an earthly monarch  The unhappy spirit of discord which pervaded  Indifference of Constantine  the provinces of the East interrupted the triumph of Constantine but the emperor continued for some time to view with cool and careless indifference  A D  the object of the dispute As he was yet ignorant of the difficulty of appeasing the quarrels of theologians he addressed to the contending parties to Alexander and to Arius a moderating epistle  Eusebius in Vit Constant l ii c The principles of toleration and religious indifference contained in this epistle have given great offence to Baronius Tillemont c who suppose that the emperor had some evil counsellor either Satan or Eusebius at his elbow See Jortin's Remarks tom ii p  which may be ascribed with far greater reason to the untutored sense of a soldier and statesman than to the dictates of any of his episcopal counsellors He attributes the origin of the whole controversy to a trifling and subtle question concerning an incomprehensible point of the law which was foolishly asked by the bishop and imprudently resolved by the presbyter He laments that the Christian people who had the same God the same religion and the same worship should be divided by such inconsiderable  distinctions and he seriously recommends to the clergy of Alexandria the example of the Greek philosophers who could maintain their arguments without losing their temper and assert their freedom without violating their friendship The indifference and contempt of the sovereign would have been perhaps the most effectual method of silencing the dispute if the popular current had been less rapid and impetuous and if Constantine himself in the midst of faction and fanaticism could have preserved the calm possession of his own mind But his ecclesiastical ministers soon contrived to seduce the impartiality of the magistrate and to awaken the zeal of the proselyte He was provoked by the insults which had  His zeal  been offered to his statues he was alarmed by the  A D  real as well as the imaginary magnitude of the spreading mischief and he extinguished the hope of peace and toleration from the moment that he assembled three hundred bishops within the walls of the same palace The presence of the monarch swelled the importance of the debate his attention multiplied the arguments and he exposed his person with a patient intrepidity which animated the valour of the combatants Notwithstanding the applause which has been bestowed on the eloquence and sagacity of Constantine  Eusebius in Vit Constantin l iii c  a Roman general whose religion might be still a subject of doubt and whose mind had not been enlightened either by study or by inspiration was indifferently qualified to discuss in the Greek  language a metaphysical question or an article of faith But the credit of his favourite Osius who appears to have presided in the council of Nice might dispose the emperor in favour of the orthodox party and a welltimed insinuation that the same Eusebius of Nicomedia who now protected the heretic had lately assisted the tyrant  Theodoret has preserved l i c an epistle from Constantine to the people of Nicomedia in which the monarch declares himself the public accuser of one of his subjects he styles Eusebius  and complains of his hostile behaviour during the civil war  might exasperate him against their adversaries The Nicene creed was ratified by Constantine and his firm declaration that those who resisted the divine judgment of the synod must prepare themselves for an immediate exile annihilated the murmurs of a feeble opposition which from seventeen was almost instantly reduced to two protesting bishops Eusebius of Caesarea yielded a reluctant and ambiguous consent to the Homoousion  See in Socrates l i c or rather in Theodoret l i c an original letter of Eusebius of Caesarea in which he attempts to justify his subscribing the Homoousion The character of Eusebius has always been a problem but those who have read the second critical epistle of Le Clerc Ars Critica tom iii p must entertain a very unfavourable opinion of the orthodoxy and sincerity of the bishop of Caesarea  and the wavering conduct of the Nicomedian Eusebius served only to delay about three months his disgrace and exile  Athanasius tom i p Philostorgius l i c and Godefroy's Commentary p  The impious  He persecutes the Arian  Arius was banished into one of the remote provinces of Illyricum his person and disciples were branded by law with the odious name of  Porphyrians his writings were condemned to the flames and a capital punishment was denounced against those in whose possession they should be found The emperor had now imbibed the spirit of controversy and the angry sarcastic style of his edicts was designed to inspire his subjects with the hatred which he had conceived against the enemies of Christ  Socrates l i c In his circular letters which were addressed to the several cities Constantine employed against the heretics the arms of ridicule and  comic  raillery    But as if the conduct of the emperor had been  and the orthodox party  guided by passion instead of principle three years from the council of Nice were scarcely elapsed  A D  before he discovered some symptoms of mercy and even of indulgence towards the proscribed sect which was secretly protected by his favourite sister The exiles were recalled and Eusebius who gradually resumed his influence over the mind of Constantine was restored to the episcopal throne from which he had been ignominiously degraded Arius himself was treated by the whole court with the respect which would have been due to an innocent and oppressed man His faith was approved by the synod of Jerusalem and the emperor seemed impatient to repair his injustice by issuing an absolute command that he should be solemnly admitted to the communion in the cathedral of Constantinople On the same day which had been fixed for the triumph of Arius he expiredand the strange and horrid circumstances of his death might excite a suspicion that  the orthodox saints had contributed more efficaciously than by their prayers to deliver the church from the most formidable of her enemies  We derive the original story from Athanasius tom i p who expresses some reluctance to stigmatize the memory of the dead He might exaggerate but the perpetual commerce of Alexandria and Constantinople would have rendered it dangerous to invent Those who press the literal narrative of the death of Arius his bowels suddenly burst out in a privy must make their option between  poison  and  miracle  The three principal leaders of the Catholics Athanasius of Alexandria Eustathius of Antioch and Paul of Constantinople were deposed on various accusations by the sentence of numerous councils and were afterwards banished into distant provinces by the first of the Christian emperors who in the last moments of his life received the rites of baptism from the Arian bishop of Nicomedia The ecclesiastical government of Constantine cannot be justified from the reproach of levity and weakness But the credulous monarch unskilled in the stratagems of theological warfare might be deceived by the modest and specious professions of the heretics whose sentiments he never perfectly understood and while he protected Arius and persecuted Athanasius he still considered the council of Nice as the bulwark of the Christian faith and the peculiar glory of his own reign  The change in the sentiments or at least in the conduct of Constantine may be traced in Eusebius in Vit Constant l iii c l iv c Socrates l i c Sozomen l ii c Theodoret l i c and Philostorgius l ii c But the first of these writers was too near the scene of action and the others were too remote from it It is singular enough that the important task of continuing the history of the church should have been left for two laymen and a heretic    The sons of Constantine must have been admitted from their childhood into the rank of catechumens but they imitated in the delay of

Quia etiam tum catechumenus sacramentum fidei merito videretur potuisse nescire Sulp Sever Hist Sacra l ii p  and the fate of the Trinitarian controversy depended in a great measure on the sentiments of Constantius who inherited the provinces of the East and acquired the possession of the whole empire The Arian presbyter or bishop who had secreted for his use the testament of the deceased emperor improved the fortunate occasion which had introduced him to the familiarity of a prince whose public counsels were always swayed by his domestic favourites The eunuchs and slaves diffused the spiritual poison through the palace and the dangerous infection was communicated by the female attendants to the guards and by the empress to her unsuspicious husband  Socrates l ii c Sozomen l iii c Athanas tom i p He observes that the eunuchs are the natural enemies of the  Son  Compare Dr Jortin's Remarks on Ecclesiastical History vol iv p with a certain genealogy in  Candide  ch iv which ends with one of the first companions of Christopher Columbus  The partiality which Constantius always expressed towards the Eusebian faction was insensibly fortified by the dexterous management of their leaders and his victory over the tyrant Magnentius encreased his inclination as well as ability to employ the arms of power in the cause of Arianism While the two armies were engaged in the plains  of Mursa and the fate of the two rivals depended on the chance of war the son of Constantine passed the anxious moments in a church of the martyrs under the walls of the city His spiritual comforter Valens the Arian bishop of the diocese employed the most artful precautions to obtain such early intelligence as might secure either his favour or his escape A secret chain of swift and trusty messengers informed him of the vicissitudes of the battle and while the courtiers stood trembling round their affrighted master Valens assured him that the Gallic legions gave way and insinuated with some presence of mind that the glorious event had been revealed to him by an angel The grateful emperor ascribed his success to the merits and intercession of the bishop of Mursa whose faith had deserved the public and miraculous approbation of Heaven  Sulpicius Severus in Hist Sacra l ii p  The Arians who considered as their own the victory of Constantius preferred his glory to that of his Father  Cyril apud Baron A D No expressly observes that in the reign of Constantine the cross had been found in the bowels of the earth but that it had appeared in the reign of Constantius in the midst of the heavens This opposition evidently proves that Cyril was ignorant of the stupendous miracle to which the conversion of Constantine is attributed and this ignorance is the more surprising since it was no more than twelve years after his death that Cyril was consecrated bishop of Jerusalem by the immediate successor of Eusebius of Caesarea See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom viii p  Cyril bishop of Jerusalem immediately composed the description of a celestial cross encircled with a splendid rainbow which during the festival of Pentecost about the third hour of the day had  appeared over the Mount of Olives to the edification of the devout pilgrims and the people of the holy city  It is not easy to determine how far the ingenuity of Cyril might be assisted by some natural appearances of a solar halo  The size of the meteor was gradually magnified and the Arian historian has ventured to affirm that it was conspicuous to the two armies in the plains of Pannonia and that the tyrant who is purposely represented as an idolater fled before the auspicious sign of orthodox Christianity  Philostorgius l iii c He is followed by the author of the Alexandrian Chronicle by Cedrenus and by Nicephorus See Gothofred Dissert p They could not refuse a miracle even from the hand of an enemy    The sentiments of a judicious stranger who  Arian councils  has impartially considered the progress of civil or ecclesiastical discord are always entitled to our notice and a short passage of Ammianus who served in the armies and studied the character of Constantius is perhaps of more value than many pages of theological invectives  The Christian religion which in itself says that moderate historian is plain and simple  he  confounded by the dotage of superstition Instead of reconciling the parties by the weight of his authority he cherished and propagated by verbal disputes the differences which his vain curiosity had excited The highways were covered with troops of bishops galloping from every side to the assemblies which they call synods and while they laboured to reduce the whole sect to their own particular opinions the public establishment  of the posts was almost ruined by their hasty and repeated journies  So curious a passage well deserves to be transcribed Christianam religionem absolutam et simplicem anili superstitione confundens in quâ

transactions of the reign of Constantius would furnish an ample commentary on this remarkable passage which justifies the rational apprehensions of Athanasius that the restless activity of the clergy who wandered round the empire in search of the true faith would excite the contempt and laughter of the unbelieving world  Athanas tom i p  As soon as the emperor was relieved from the terrors of the civil war he devoted the leisure of his winterquarters at Arles Milan Sirmium and Constantinople to the amusement or toils of controversy the sword of the magistrate and even of the tyrant was unsheathed to enforce the reasons of the theologian and as he opposed the orthodox faith of Nice it is readily confessed that his incapacity and ignorance were equal to his presumption  Socrates l ii c Sozomen l iv c Theodoret l ii c Philostorg l iv c l v c l vi c  The eunuchs the women and the bishops who governed the vain and feeble mind of the emperor had inspired him with an insuperable dislike to the Homoousion but his timid conscience was  alarmed by the impiety of Aetius The guilt of that atheist was aggravated by the suspicious favour of the unfortunate Gallus and even the deaths of the Imperial ministers who had been massacred at Antioch were imputed to the suggestions of that dangerous sophist The mind of Constantius which could neither be moderated by reason nor fixed by faith was blindly impelled to either side of the dark and empty abyss by his horror of the opposite extreme he alternately embraced and condemned the sentiments he successively banished and recalled the leaders of the Arian and SemiArian factions  Sozomen l iv c Athanas tom i p Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p has collected several instances of the haughty fanaticism of Constantius from the detached treatises of Lucifer of Cagliari The very titles of these treatises inspire zeal and terror  "Moriendum pro Dei Filio"  "De Regibus Apostaticis"  "De non conveniendo cum Haeretico"  "De non parcendo in Deum delinquentibus"  During the season of public business or festivity he employed whole days and even nights in selecting the words and weighing the syllables which composed his fluctuating creeds The subject of his meditation still pursued and occupied his slumbers the incoherent dreams of the emperor were received as celestial visions and he accepted with complacency the lofty title of bishop of bishops from those ecclesiastics who forgot the interest of their order for the gratification of their passions The design of establishing an uniformity of doctrine which had engaged him to convene so many synods in Gaul Italy Illyricum and Asia was repeatedly baffled by his own  levity by the divisions of the Arians and by the resistance of the catholics and he resolved as the last and decisive effort imperiously to dictate the decrees of a general council The destructive earthquake of Nicomedia the difficulty of finding a convenient place and perhaps some secret motives of policy produced an alteration in the summons The bishops of the East were directed to meet at Seleucia in Isauria while those of the West held their deliberations at Rimini on the coast of the Hadriatic and instead of two or three deputies from each province the whole episcopal body was ordered to march The Eastern council after consuming four days in fierce and unavailing debate separated without any definitive conclusion The council of the West was protracted till the seventh month Taurus the Praetorian praefect was instructed not to dismiss the prelates till they should all be united in the same opinion and his efforts were supported by a power of banishing fifteen of the most refractory and a promise of the consulship if he atchieved so difficult an adventure His  A D  prayers and threats the authority of the sovereign the sophistry of Valens and Ursacius the distress of cold and hunger and the tedious melancholy of a hopeless exile at length extorted the reluctant consent of the bishops of Rimini The deputies of the East and of the West attended the emperor in the palace of Constantinople and he enjoyed the satisfaction of imposing on the world a profession of faith which established the  likeness  without expressing the  consubstantiality  of the Son of  God  Sulp Sever Hist Sacra l ii p The Greek historians were very ignorant of the affairs of the West  But the triumph of Arianism had been preceded by the removal of the orthodox clergy whom it was impossible either to intimidate or to corrupt and the reign of Constantius was disgraced by the unjust

successively witness to his merit and his sufferings in the cause of the Homoousion which he considered as the sole pleasure and business as the duty and as the glory of his life Amidst the storms of persecution the archbishop of Alexandria was patient of labour jealous of fame careless of safety and although his mind was tainted by the contagion of fanaticism Athanasius displayed a superiority of character and abilities which would have qualified him far better than the degenerate sons of Constantine for the government of a great monarchy His learning was much less profound and extensive than that of Eusebius of Caesarea and his rude eloquence could not be compared with the polished oratory of Gregory or Basil but whenever the primate of Egypt was called upon to justify his sentiments or his conduct his unpremeditated style either of speaking or writing was clear forcible and persuasive He has always been revered in the orthodox school as one of the most accurate masters of the Christian theology and he was supposed to possess two profane sciences less adapted to the episcopal character the knowledge  of jurisprudence  Sulpicius Severus Hist Sacra l ii p calls him a lawyer a jùrisconsult This character cannot now be discovered either in the life or writings of Athanasius  and that of divination  Dicebatur enim fatidicarum sortium fidem quaeve augurales portenderent alites scientissime callens aliquoties praedixisse futura Ammianus xv A prophecy or rather a joke is related by Sozomen l iv c which evidently proves if the crows speak Latin that Athanasius understood the language of the crows  Some fortunate conjectures of future events which impartial reasoners might ascribe to the experience and judgment of Athanasius were attributed by his friends to heavenly inspiration and imputed by his enemies to infernal magic  But as Athanasius was continually engaged with the prejudices and passions of every order of men from the monk to the emperor the knowledge of human nature was his first and most important science He preserved a distinct and unbroken view of a scene which was incessantly shifting and never failed to improve those decisive moments which are irrecoverably past before they are perceived by a common eye The archbishop of Alexandria was capable of distinguishing how far he might boldly command and where he must dextrously insinuate how long he might contend with power and when he must withdraw from persecution and while he directed the thunders of the church against heresy and rebellion he could assume in the bosom of his own party the flexible and indulgent temper of a prudent leader The election of Athanasius has not escaped the reproach of irregularity and precipitation  The irregular ordination of Athanasius was slightly mentioned in the councils which were held against him See Philostorg l ii c and Godefroy p but it can scarcely be supposed that the assembly of the bishops of Egypt would solemnly attest a  public  falsehood Athanas tom i p  but the propriety  of his behaviour conciliated the affections both of the clergy and of the people The Alexandrians were impatient to rise in arms for the defence of an eloquent and liberal pastor In his distress he always derived support or at least consolation from the faithful attachment of his parochial clergy and the hundred bishops of Egypt adhered with unshaken zeal to the cause of Athanasius In the modest equipage which pride and policy would affect he frequently performed the episcopal visitation of his provinces from the mouth of the Nile to the confines of Aethiopia familiarly conversing with the meanest of the populace and humbly saluting the saints and hermits of the desert  See the History of the Fathers of the Desert published by Rosweide and Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii in the lives of Antony Pachomius c Athanasius himself who did not disdain to compose the life of his friend Anthony has carefully observed how often the holy monk deplored and prophesied the mischiefs of the Arian Heresy Athanas tom ii p c  Nor was it only in ecclesiastical assemblies among men whose education and manners were similar to his own that Athanasius displayed the ascendancy of his genius He appeared with easy and respectful firmness in the courts of princes and in the various turns of his prosperous and adverse fortune he never lost the confidence of his friends or the esteem of his enemies  In his youth the primate of Egypt resisted the  Persecution against Athanasius  great Constantine who had repeatedly signified  A D  his will that Arius should be restored to the Catholic communion  At first Constantine threatened in  speaking  but requested in  writing  His letters gradually assumed a menacing tonc but while he required that the entrance of the church should be open to  all  he avoided the odious name of Arius Athanasius like a skilful politician has accurately marked these distinctions tom i p which allowed him some scope for excuse and delay  The emperor respected and might forgive this inflexible resolution and the faction who considered Athanasius as their most formidable enemy were constrained to dissemble their hatred and silently to prepare an indirect and distant assault They scattered rumours and suspicions represented the archbishop as a proud and oppressive tyrant and boldly accused him of violating the treaty which had been ratified in the Nicene council with the schismatic followers of Meletius  The Meletians in Egypt like the Donatists in Asrica were produced by an episcopal quarrel which arose from the persecution I have not leisure to pursue the obscure controversy which seems to have been misrepresented by the partiality of Athanasius and the ignorance of Epiphanius See Mosheim's General History of the Church vol i p  Athanasius had openly disapproved that ignominious peace and the emperor was disposed to believe that he had abused his ecclesiastical and civil power to persecute those odious sectaries that he had sacrilegiously broken a chalice in one of their churches of Maraeotis that he had whipped or imprisoned six of their bishops and that Arsenius a seventh bishop of the same party had been murdered or at least mutilated by the cruel hand of the primate  The treatment of the six bishops is specified by Sozomen l ii c but Athanasius himself so copious on the subject of Arsenius and the chalice leaves this grave accusation without a reply    These charges which affected his honour and his life were referred by Constantine to his brother Dalmatius the Censor who resided at Antioch the synods of Caesarea and Tyre were successively convened and the bishops of the East were instructed to judge the cause of Athanasius before they proceeded to consecrate the new church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem The primate might be conscious of his innocence but he was sensible that the same implacable spirit which had dictated the accusation would direct the proceeding and pronounce the sentence He prudently declined the tribunal of his enemies despised the summons of the synod of Caesarea and after a long and artful delay submitted to the peremptory commands of the emperor who threatened to punish his criminal disobedience if he refused to appear in the council of Tyre  Athanas tom i p Socrates l i c Sozomen l ii c The emperor in his Epistle of Convocation Euseb in Vit Constant l iv c seems to prejudge some members of the clergy and it was more than probable that the synod would apply those reproaches to Athanasius  Before Athanasius at the head of fifty Egyptian  A D  prelates sailed from Alexandria he had wisely secured the alliance of the Meletians and Arsenius himself his imaginary victim and his secret friend was privately concealed in his train The synod of Tyre was conducted by Eusebius of Caesarea with more passion and with less art than his learning and experience might promise  his numerous faction repeated the names of homicide and tyrant and their clamours were encouraged by the seeming patience of Athanasius who expected the decisive moment to produce Arsenius alive and unhurt in the midst of the assembly The nature of the other charges did not admit of such clear and satisfactory replies yet the archbishop was able to prove that in the village where he was accused of breaking a consecrated chalice neither church nor altar nor chalice could really exist The Arians who had secretly determined the guilt and condemnation of their enemy attempted however to disguise their injustice by the imitation of judicial forms the synod appointed an episcopal commission of six delegates to collect evidence on the spot and this measure which was vigorously opposed by the Egyptian bishops opened new scenes of violence and perjury  See in particular the second Apology of Athanasius tom i p and his Epistles to the Monks p They are justified by original and authentic documents but they would inspire more confidence if he appeared less innocent and his enemies less absurd  After the return of the deputies from Alexandria the majority of the council pronounced the final sentence of degradation and exile against the primate of Egypt The decree expressed in the fiercest language of malice and revenge was communicated to the emperor and the catholic church and the bishops immediately resumed a mild and devout aspect such as became their holy pilgrimage to the Sepulchre of Christ  Eusebius in Vit Constantin l iv c    But the injustice of these ecclesiastical judges had not been countenanced by the submission or even by the presence of Athanasius He resolved  His first exile  to make a bold and dangerous experiment  A D  whether the throne was inaccessible to the voice of truth and before the final sentence could be pronounced at Tyre the intrepid primate threw himself into a bark which was ready to hoist sail for the Imperial city The request of a formal audience might have been opposed or eluded but Athanasius concealed his arrival watched the moment of Constantine's return from an adjacent villa and boldly encountered his angry sovereign as he passed on horseback through the principal street of Constantinople So strange an apparition excited his surprise and indignation and the guards were ordered to remove the importunate suitor but his resentment was subdued by involuntary respect and the haughty spirit of the emperor was awed by the courage and eloquence of a bishop who implored his justice and awakened his conscience  Athanas tom i p In a church dedicated to St Athanasius this situation would afford a better subject for a picture than most of the stories of miracles and martyrdoms  Constantine listened to the complaints of Athanasius with impartial and even gracious attention the members of the synod of Tyre were summoned to justify their proceedings and the arts of the Eusebian faction would have been confounded if they had not aggravated the guilt of the primate by the dexterous supposition of an unpardonable offence a criminal design to intercept and detain the cornfleet  of Alexandria which supplied the subsistence of the new capital  Athanas tom i p Eunapius has related in Vit Sophist p edit Commelin a strange example of the cruelty and credulity of Constantine on a similar occasion The eloquent Sopater a Syrian philosopher enjoyed his friendship and provoked the resentment of Ablavius his Praetorian praefect The cornfleet was detained for want of a south wind the people of Constantinople were discontented and Sopater was beheaded on a charge that he had  bound  the winds by the power of magic Suidas adds that Constantine wished to prove by this execution that he had absolutely renounced the superstition of the Gentiles  The emperor was satisfied that the peace of Egypt would be secured by the absence of a popular leader but he refused to fill the vacancy of the archiepiscopal throne and the sentence which after long hesitation he pronounced was that of a jealous ostracism rather than of an ignominious exile In the remote province of Gaul but in the hospitable court of Treves Athanasius passed about twentyeight months The death of the emperor changed the face of public affairs and amidst the general indulgence of a young reign the primate was  and restoration  restored to his country by an honourable edict of the younger Constantine who expressed a deep  A D  sense of the innocence and merit of his venerable guest  In his return he saw Constantius twice at Viminiacum and at Caesarea in Cappadocia Athanas tom i p Tillemont supposes that Constantine introduced him to the meeting of the three royal brothers in Pannonia Memoires Eccles tom viii p    The death of that prince exposed Athanasius to  His second exile  a second persecution and the feeble Constantius the sovereign of the East soon became the secret  A D  accomplice of the Eusebians Ninety bishops of that sect or faction assembled at Antioch under  the specious pretence of dedicating the cathedral They composed an ambiguous creed which is faintly tinged with the colours of SemiArianism and twentyfive canons which still regulate the discipline of the orthodox Greeks  See Beveridge Pandect tom i p and tom ii Annotation p Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vi p St Hilary of Poitiers has mentioned this synod of Antioch with too much favour and respect He reckons ninetyseven bishops  It was decided with some appearance of equity that a bishop deprived by a synod should not resume his episcopal functions till he had been absolved by the judgment of an equal synod the law was immediately applied to the case of Athanasius the council of Antioch pronounced or rather

assiduous study of the Latin language he soon qualified himself to negotiate with the western clergy his decent flattery swayed and directed the haughty Julius the Roman Pontiff was persuaded to consider his appeal as the peculiar interest of the Apostolic see and his innocence was unanimously declared in a council of fifty bishops of Italy At the end of three years the primate was summoned to the court of Milan by the emperor Constans who in the indulgence of unlawful pleasures still professed a lively regard for the orthodox faith The cause of truth and justice was promoted by the influence of gold  Philostorgius l iii c If any corruption was used to promote the interest of religion an advocate of Athanasius might justify or excuse this questionable conduct by the example of Cato and Sidney the former of whom is  said  to have given and the latter to have received a bribe in the cause of liberty  and the ministers of Constans advised their sovereign to require the convocation of an ecclesiastical assembly which might act as the representatives of the Catholic church Ninetyfour  A D  bishops of the West seventysix bishops of the East encountered each other at Sardica on the verge of the two empires but in the dominions  of the protector of Athanasius Their debates soon degenerated into hostile altercations the Asiatics apprehensive for their personal safety retired to Philippopolis in Thrace and the rival synods reciprocally hurled their spiritual thunders against their enemies whom they piously condemned as the enemies of the true God Their decrees were published and ratified in their respective provinces and Athanasius who in the West was revered as a saint was exposed as a criminal to the abhorrence of the East  The Canon which allows appeals to the Roman Pontiffs has almost raised the council of Sardica to the dignity of a general council and its acts have been ignorantly or artfully confounded with those of the Nicene synod See Tillemont tom viii p and Geddes's Tracts vol ii p  The council of Sardica reveals the first symptoms of discord and schism between the Greek and Latin churches which were separated by the accidental difference of faith and the permanent distinction of language  During his second exile in the West Athanasius  and restoration  was frequently admitted to the Imperial presence  A D  at Capua Lodi Milan Verona Padua Aquileia and Treves The bishop of the diocese usually assisted at these interviews the master of the offices stood before the veil or curtain of the sacred apartment and the uniform moderation of the primate might be attested by these respectable witnesses to whose evidence he solemnly appeals  As Athanasius dispersed secret invectives against Constantius see the Epistle to the Monks at the same time that he assured him of his profound respect we might distrust the professions of the archbishop Tom i p  Prudence would undoubtedly suggest  the mild and respectful tone that became a subject and a bishop In these familiar conferences with the sovereign of the West Athanasius might lament the error of Constantius but he boldly arraigned the guilt of his eunuchs and his Arian prelates deplored the distress and danger of the Catholic church and excited Constans to emulate the zeal and glory of his father The emperor declared his resolution of employing the troops and treasures of Europe in the orthodox cause and signified by a concise and peremptory epistle to his brother Constantius that unless he consented to the immediate restoration of Athanasius he himself with a fleet and army would seat the archbishop on the throne of Alexandria  Notwithstanding the discreet silence of Athanasius and the manifest forgery of a letter inserted by Socrates these menaces are proved by the unquestionable evidence of Luciser of Cagliari and even of Constantius himself See Tillemont tom viii p  But this religious war so horrible to nature was prevented by the timely compliance of Constantius and the emperor of the East condescended to solicit a reconciliation with a subject whom he had injured Athanasius waited with decent pride till he had received three successive epistles full of the strongest assurances of the protection the favour and the esteem of his sovereign who invited him to resume his episcopal seat and who added the humiliating precaution of engaging his principal ministers to attest the sincerity of his intentions They were manifested in a still more public manner by the strict orders which were dispatched into Egypt to recall the adherents of  Athanasius to restore their privileges to proclaim their innocence and to eraze from the public registers the illegal proceedings which had been obtained during the prevalence of the Eusebian faction After every satisfaction and security had been given which justice or even delicacy could require the primate proceeded by slow journeys through the provinces of Thrace Asia and Syria and his progress was marked by the abject homage of the Oriental bishops who excited his contempt without deceiving his penetration  I have always entertained some doubts concerning the retractation of Ursacius and Valens Athanas tom i p Their epistles to Julius bishop of Rome and to Athanasius himself are of so different a cast from each other that they cannot both be genuine The one speaks the language of criminals who confess their guilt and infamy the other of enemies who solicit on equal terms an honourable reconciliation  At Antioch he saw the emperor Constantius sustained with modest firmness the embraces and protestations of his master and eluded the proposal of allowing the Arians a single church at Alexandria by claiming in the other cities of the empire a similar toleration for his own party a reply which might have appeared just and moderate in the mouth of an independent prince The entrance of the archbishop into his capital was a triumphal procession absence and persecution had endeared him to the Alexandrians his authority which he exercised with rigour was more firmly established and his fame was diffused from Aethiopia to Britain over the whole extent of the Christian world  The circumstances of his second return may be collected from Athanasius himself tom i p and Socrates l ii c Sozomen l iii c Theodoret l ii c Philostorgius l iii c    But the subject who has reduced his prince to the necessity of dissembling can never expect a sincere and lasting forgiveness and the tragic  Resentment of Constantius  fate of Constans soon deprived Athanasius of a powerful and generous protector The civil war  A D  between the assassin and the only surviving brother of Constans which afflicted the empire above three years secured an interval of repose to the Catholic church and the two contending parties were desirous to conciliate the friendship of a bishop who by the weight of his personal authority might determine the fluctuating resolutions of an important province He gave audience to the ambassadors of the tyrant with whom he was afterwards accused of holding a secret correspondence  Athanasius tom i p defends his innocence by pathetic complaints solemn assertions and specious arguments He admits that letters had been forged in his name but he requests that his own secretaries and those of the tyrant may be examined whether those letters had been written by the former or received by the latter  and the emperor Constantius repeatedly assured his dearest father the most reverend Athanasius that notwithstanding the malicious rumours which were circulated by their common enemies he had inherited the sentiments as well as the throne of his deceased brother  Athanas tom i p  Gratitude and humanity would have disposed the primate of Egypt to deplore the untimely fate of Constans and to abhor the guilt of Magnentius but as he clearly understood that the apprehensions of Constantius were his only safeguard the  servour of his prayers for the success of the righteous cause might perhaps be somewhat abated The ruin of Athanasius was no longer contrived by the obscure malice of a few bigoted or angry bishops who abused the authority of a credulous monarch The monarch himself avowed the resolution which he had so long suppressed of avenging his private injuries  Athanas tom i p Theodoret l ii c The emperor declared that he was more desirous to subdue Athanasius than he had been to vanquish Magnentius or Sylvanus  and the first winter after his victory which he passes at Arles was employed against an enemy more odious to him than the vanquished tyrant of Gaul  If the emperor had capriciously decreed the  Councils of Arles and Milan  death of the most eminent and virtuous citizen of the republic the cruel order would have been  A D  executed without hesitation by the ministers of open violence or of specious injustice The caution the delay the difficulty with which he proceeded in the condemnation and punishment of a popular bishop discovered to the world that the privileges of the church had already revived a sense of order and freedom in the Roman government The sentence which was pronounced in the synod of Tyre and subscribed by a large majority of the eastern bishops had never been expressly repealed and as Athanasius had been once degraded from his episcopal dignity by the judgment of his brethren every subsequent act might be considered as irregular and even criminal But the memory of the firm and effectual support which the primate of Egypt had derived  from the attachment of the western church engaged Constantius to suspend the execution of the sentence till he had obtained the concurrence of the Latin bishops Two years were consumed in ecclesiastical negociations and the important cause between the emperor and one of his subjects was solemnly debated first in the synod of Arles and afterwards in the great council of Milan  The affairs of the council of Milan are so imperfectly and erroneously related by the Greek writers that we must rejoice in the supply of some letters of Eusebius extracted by Baronius from the archives of the church of Vercellae and of an old life of Dionysius of Milan published by Bollandus See Baronius A D and Tillemont tom vii p  which consisted of above three hundred bishops Their integrity was gradually undermined by the arguments of the Arians the dexterity of the eunuchs and the pressing solicitations of a prince who gratified his revenge at the expence of his dignity and exposed his own passions whilst he influenced those of the clergy Corruption the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty was successfully practised honours gifts and immunities were offered and accepted as the price of an episcopal vote  The honours presents feasts which seduced so many bishops are mentioned with indignation by those who were too pure or too proud to accept them  We combat says Hilary of Poitiers against Constantius the antichrist who strokes the belly instead of scourging the back  qui non dorsa caedit sed ventrem palpat Hilarius contra Constant c p  and the condemnation of the Alexandrian primate was artfully represented as the only measure which could restore the peace and union of the Catholic church The friends of Athanasius were not however wanting to their  leader or to their cause With a manly spirit which the sanctity of their character rendered less dangerous they maintained in public debate and in private conference with the emperor the eternal obligation of religion and justice They declared that neither the hope of his favour nor the fear of his displeasure should prevail on them to join in the condemnation of an absent an innocent a respectable brother  Something of this opposition is mentioned by Ammianus xv who had a very dark and superficial knowledge of ecclesiastical history Liberius perseveranter renitebatur nec visum hominem nec auditum damnare nefas ultimum saepe exclamans aperte scilicet recalcitrans Imperatoris arbitrario Id enim ille Athanasio semper infestus c  They affirmed with apparent reason that the illegal and obsolete decrees of the council of Tyre had long since been tacitly abolished by the Imperial edicts the honourable reestablishment of the archbishop of Alexandria and the silence or recantation of his most clamorous adversaries They alleged that his innocence had been attested by the unanimous bishops of Egypt and had been acknowledged in the councils of Rome and Sardica  More properly by the orthodox part of the council of Sardica If the bishops of both parties had fairly voted the division would have been to M de Tillemont see tom viii p is justly surprised that so small a majority should have proceeded so vigorously against their adversaries the principal of whom they immediately deposed  by the impartial judgment of the Latin church They deplored the hard condition of Athanasius who after enjoying so many years his seat his reputation and the seeming confidence of his sovereign was again called upon to confute the most groundless  and extravagant accusations Their language was specious their conduct was honourable but in this long and obstinate contest which fixed the eyes of the whole empire on a single bishop the ecclesiastical factions were prepared to sacrifice truth and justice to the more interesting object of defending or removing the intrepid champion of the Nicene faith The Arians still thought it prudent to disguise in ambiguous language their real sentiments and designs but the orthodox bishops armed with the favour of the people and the decrees of a general council insisted on every occasion and particularly at Milan that their adversaries should purge themselves from the suspicion of heresy before they presumed to arraign the conduct of the great Athanasius  Sulp Severus in Hist Sacra l ii p    But the voice of reason if reason was indeed on  Condemnation of Athanasius  the side of Athanasius was silenced by the clamours of a factious or venal majority and the councils of Arles and Milan were not dissolved  A D  till the archbishop of Alexandria had been solemnly condemned and deposed by the judgment of the Western as well as of the Eastern church The bishops who had opposed were required to subscribe the sentence and to unite in religious communion with the suspected leaders of the adverse party A formulary of consent was transmitted by the messengers of state to the absent bishops and all those who refused to submit their private opinion to the public and inspired wisdom of the councils of Arles and Milan were  immediately banished by the emperor who affected to execute the decrees of the Catholic church Among those prelates who led the honourable band of confessors and exiles Liberius of Rome Osius of Cordova Paulanus of Treves Dionysius of Milan Eusebius of Vercellae Lucifer of Cagliari and Hilary of Poitiers may deserve to be particularly distinguished The eminent station of Liberius who governed the capital of the empire the personal merit and long experience of the venerable Osius who was revered as the favourite of the great Constantine and the father of the Nicene faith placed those prelates at the head of the Latin church and their example either of submission or resistance would probably be imitated by the episcopal crowd But the repeated attempts of the emperor to seduce or to intimidate the bishops of Rome and Cordova were for some time ineffectual The Spaniard declared himself ready to suffer under Constantius as he had suffered threescore years before under his grandfather Maximian The Roman in the presence of his sovereign asserted the innocence of Athanasius and his own freedom When he was banished to Beraea in Thrace he sent back a large sum which had been offered for the accommodation of his journey and insulted the court of Milan by the haughty remark that the emperor and his eunuchs might want that gold to pay their soldiers and their bishops  The exile of Liberius is mentioned by Ammianus xv See Theodoret l ii c Athanas tom i p Hilar Fragment i  The  resolution of Liberius and Osius was at length subdued by the hardships of exile and confinement The Roman pontiff purchased his return by some criminal compliances and afterwards expiated his guilt by a seasonable repentance Persuasion and violence were employed to extort the reluctant signature of the decrepid bishop of Cordova whose strength was broken and whose faculties were perhaps impaired by the weight of an hundred years and the insolent triumph of the Arians provoked some of the orthodox party to treat with inhuman severity the character or rather the memory of an unfortunate old man to whose former services Christianity itself was so deeply indebted  The life of Osius is collected by Tillemont tom vii p who in the most extravagant terms first admires and then reprobates the bishop of Cordova In the midst of their lamentations on his fall the prudence of Athanasius may be distinguished from the blind and intemperate zeal of Hilary    The fall of Liberius and Osius reflected a  Exiles  brighter lustre on the firmness of those bishops who still adhered with unshaken fidelity to the cause of Athanasius and religious truth The ingenious malice of their enemies had deprived them of the benefit of mutual comfort and advice separated those illustrious exiles into distant provinces and carefully selected the most inhospitable spots of a great empire  The confessors of the West were successively banished to the deserts of Arabia or Thebais the lonely places of Mount Taurus the wildest parts of Phrygia which were in the possession of the impious Montanists c When the Heretic Aetius was too favourably entertained at Mopsuestia in Cilicia the place of his exile was changed by the advice of Acacius to Amblada a district inhabited by savages and infested by war and pestilence Philostorg l v c  Yet they  soon experienced that the deserts of Libya and the most barbarous tracts of Cappadocia were less inhospitable than the residence of those cities in which an Arian bishop could satiate without restraint the exquisite rancour of theological hatred  See the cruel treatment and strange obstinacy of Eusebius in his own letters published by Baronius A D No  Their consolation was derived from the consciousness of rectitude and independence from the applause the visits the letters and the liberal alms of their adherents  Caeterum exules satis constat totius orbis studiis celebratos pecuniasque eis in sumptum affatim congestas legationibus quoque eos plebis Catholicae ex omnibus fere provinciis frequentatos Sulp Sever Hist Sacra p Athanas tom i p  and from the satisfaction which they soon enjoyed of observing the intestine divisions of the adversaries of the Nicene faith Such was the nice and capricious taste of the emperor Constantius and so easily was he offended by the slightest deviation from his imaginary standard of Christian truth that he persecuted with equal zeal those who defended the  consubstantiality  those who asserted the  similar substance  and those who denied the  likeness  of the Son of God Three bishops degraded and banished for those adverse opinions might possibly meet in the same place of exile and according to the difference of their temper might either pity or insult the blind enthusiasm of their antagonists whose present sufferings would never be compensated by future happiness  The disgrace and exile of the orthodox bishops of the West were designed as so many preparatory steps to the ruin of Athanasius himself  Ample materials for the history of this third persecution of Athanasius may be found in his own works See particularly his very able Apology to Constantius tom i p his first Apology for his flight p his prolix Epistle to the Solitaries p and the original Protest of the People of Alexandria against the violences committed by Syrianus p Sozomen l iv c has thrown into the narrative two or three luminous and important circumstances  Six  Third expulsion of Athanasius from Alexandria  and twenty months had elapsed during which the Imperial court secretly laboured by the most insidious arts to remove him from Alexandria and to withdraw the allowance which supplied his  A D  popular liberality But when the primate of of Egypt deserted and proscribed by the Latin church was left destitute of any foreign support Constantius dispatched two of his secretaries with a verbal commission to announce and execute the order of his banishment As the justice of the sentence was publicly avowed by the whole party the only motive which could restrain Constantius from giving his messengers the sanction of a written mandate must be imputed to his doubt of the event and to a sense of the danger to which he might expose the second city and the most fertile province of the empire if the people should persist in the resolution of defending by force of arms the innocence of their spiritual father Such extreme caution afforded Athanasius a specious pretence respectfully to dispute the truth of an order which he could not reconcile either with the equity or with the former declarations  of his gracious master The civil powers of Egypt found themselves inadequate to the task of persuading or compelling the primate to abdicate his episcopal throne and they were obliged to conclude a treaty with the popular leaders of Alexandria by which it was stipulated that all proceedings and all hostilities should be suspended till the emperor's pleasure had been more distinctly ascertained By this seeming moderation the Catholics were deceived into a false and fatal security while the legions of the Upper Egypt and of Libya advanced by secret orders and hasty marches to besiege or rather to surprise a capital habituated to sedition and inflamed by religious zeal  Athanasius had lately sent for Antony and some of his chosen Monks They descended from their mountain announced to the Alexandrians the sanctity of Athanasius and were honourably conducted by the archbishop as far as the gates of the city Athanas tom ii p See likewise Rufinus iii in Vit Patr p  The position of Alexandria between the sea and the lake Mareotis facilitated the approach and landing of the troops who were introduced into the heart of the city before any effectual measures could be taken either to shut the gates or to occupy the important posts of desence At the hour of midnight twentythree days after the signature of the treaty Syrianus duke of Egypt at the head of five thousand soldiers armed and prepared for an assault unexpectedly invested the church of St Theonas where the archbishop with a part of his clergy and people performed their nocturnal devotions The doors of the sacred edifice yielded to the impetuosity  of the attack which was accompanied with every horrid circumstance of tumult and bloodshed but as the bodies of the slain and the fragments of military weapons remained the next day an unexceptionable evidence in the possession of the Catholics the enterprise of Syrianus may be considered as a successful irruption rather than as an absolute conquest The other churches of the city were profaned by similar outrages and during at least four months Alexandria was exposed to the insults of a licentious army stimulated by the ecclesiastics of an hostile faction Many of the faithful were killed who may deserve the name of martyrs if their deaths were neither provoked nor revenged bishops and presbyters were treated with cruel ignominy consecrated virgins were stripped naked scourged and violated the houses of wealthy citizens were plundered and under the mask of religious zeal lust avarice and private resentment were gratified with impunity and even with applause The Pagans of Alexandria who still formed a numerous and discontented party were easily persuaded to desert a bishop whom they feared and esteemed The hopes of some peculiar favours and the apprehension of being involved in the general penalties of rebellion engaged them to promise their support to the destined successor of Athanasius the famous George of Cappadocia The usurper after receiving the consecration of an Arian synod was placed on the episcopal throne by the arms of Sebastian who had been appointed Count of Egypt for the execution  of that important design In the use as well as in the acquisition of power the tyrant George disregarded the laws of religion of justice and of humanity and the same scenes of violence and scandal which had been exhibited in the capital were repeated in more than ninety episcopal cities of Egypt Encouraged by success Constantius ventured to approve the conduct of his ministers By a public and passionate epistle the emperor congratulates the deliverance of Alexandria from a popular tyrant who deluded his blind votaries by the magic of his eloquence expatiates on the virtues and piety of the most reverend George the elected bishop and aspires as the patron and benefactor of the city to surpass the fame of Alexander himself But he solemnly declares his unalterable resolution to pursue with fire and sword the seditious adherents of the wicked Athanasius who by flying from justice has confessed his guilt and escaped the ignominious death which he had so often deserved  Athanas tom i p The emperor or his Arian secretaries while they express their resentment betray their fears and esteem of Athanasius    Athanasius had indeed escaped from the most  His behaviour  imminent dangers and the adventures of that extraordinary man deserve and fix our attention On the memorable night when the church of St Theonas was invested by the troops of Syrianus the archbishop seated on his throne expected with calm and intrepid dignity the approach of death While the public devotion was interrupted  by shouts of rage and cries of terror he animated his trembling congregation to express their religious confidence by chanting one of the psalms of David which celebrates the triumph of the God of Israel over the haughty and impious tyrant of Egypt The doors were at length burst open a cloud of arrows was discharged among the people the soldiers with drawn swords rushed forwards into the sanctuary and the dreadful gleam of their armour was reflected by the holy luminaries which burnt round the altar  These minute circumstances are curious as they are literally transcribed from the protest which was publicly presented three days afterwards by the Catholics of Alexandria See Athanas tom i p  Athanasius still rejected the pious importunity of the Monks and Presbyters who were attached to his person and nobly refused to desert his episcopal station till he had dismissed in safety the last of the congregation The darkness and tumult of the night favoured the retreat of the archbishop and though he was oppressed by the waves of an agitated multitude though he was thrown to the ground and left without sense or motion he still recovered his undaunted courage and eluded the eager search of the soldiers who were instructed by their Arian guides that the head of Athanasius would be the most acceptable present to the emperor From that moment the primate of Egypt disappeared from the eyes of his enemies and remained above six years concealed in impenetrable obscurity  The Jansenists have often compared Athanasius and Arnauld and have expatiated with pleasure on the faith and zeal the merit and exile of those celebrated doctors This concealed parallel is very dextrously managed by the Abbé de la Bleterie Vie de Jovien tom i p    The despotic power of his implacable enemy filled the whole extent of the Roman world and the exasperated monarch had endeavoured by a  His retreat  very pressing epistle to the Christian princes of  A D  Aethiopia to exclude Athanasius from the most remote and sequestered regions of the earth Counts praefects tribunes whole armies were successively employed to pursue a bishop and a fugitive the vigilance of the civil and military powers were excited by the Imperial edicts liberal rewards were promised to the man who should produce Athanasius either alive or dead and the most severe penalties were denounced against those who should dare to protect the public enemy  Hinc jam toto orbe profugus Athanasius nec ullus ci tutus ad latendum supererat locus Tribuni Praefecti Comites exercitus quoque ad pervestigandum eum moventur edictis Imporialibus praemia delatoribus proponuntur si quis eum vivum si id minus caput certe Athanasii detulisset Rufin l i c  But the deserts of Thebaïs were now peopled by a race of wild yet submissive fanatics who preferred the commands of their abbot to the laws of their sovereign The numerous disciples of Antony and Pachomius received the fugitive primate as their father admired the patience and humility with which he conformed to their strictest institutions collected every word which dropt from his lips as the genuine effusions of inspired wisdom and persuaded themselves that their prayers their fasts and their vigils were less meritorious than the zeal which they expressed  and the dangers which they braved in the defence of truth and innocence  Gregor Nazianzen tom i Orat xxi p See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p  The monasteries of Egypt were seated in lonely and desolate places on the summit of mountains or in the islands of the Nile and the sacred horn or trumpet of Tabenne was the wellknown signal which assembled several thousand robust and determined Monks who for the most part had been the peasants of the adjacent country When their dark retreats were invaded by a military force which it was impossible to resist they silently stretched out their necks to the executioner and supported their national character that tortures could never wrest from an Egyptian the confession of a secret which he was resolved not to disclose  Et nulla tormentorum vis inveniri adhuc potuit quae obdurato illius tractûs latroni invito elicere potuit ut nomen proprium dicat Ammian xxii and Valesius ad locum  The archbishop of Alexandria for whose safety they eagerly devoted their lives was lost among a uniform and welldisciplined multitude and on the nearer approach of danger he was swiftly removed by their officious hands from one place of concealment to another till he reached the formidable deserts which the gloomy and credulous temper of superstition had peopled with daemons and savage monsters The retirement of Athanasius which ended only with the life of Constantius was spent for the most part in the society of the Monks who faithfully served him as guards as secretaries and as messengers  but the importance of maintaining a more intimate connection with the Catholic party tempted him whenever the diligence of the pursuit was abated to emerge from the desert to introduce himself into Alexandria and to trust his person to the discretion of his friends and adherents His various adventures might have furnished the subject of a very entertaining romance He was once secreted in a dry cistern which he had scarcely left before he was betrayed by the treachery of a female slave  Rufin l i c Sozomen l iv c This and the following story will be rendered impossible if we suppose that Athanasius always inhabited the asylum which he accidentally or occasionally had used  and he was once concealed in a still more extraordinary asylum the house of a virgin only twenty years of age and who was celebrated in the whole city for her exquisite beauty At the hour of midnight as she related the story many years afterwards she was surprised by the appearance of the archbishop in a loose undress who advancing with hasty steps conjured her to afford him the protection which he had been directed by a celestial vision to seek under her hospitable roof The pious maid accepted and preserved the sacred pledge which was entrusted to her prudence and courage Without imparting the secret to any one she instantly conducted Athanasius into her most secret chamber and watched over his safety with the tenderness of a friend and the assiduity of a servant As long as the danger continued she regularly supplied him with books and provisions washed his feet managed  his correspondence and dexterously concealed from the eye of suspicion this familiar and solitary intercourse between a saint whose character required the most unblemished chastity and a female whose charms might excite the most dangerous emotions  Palladius Hist Lausiac c in Vit Patrum p the original author of this anecdote had conversed with the damsel who in her old age still remembered with pleasure so pious and honourable a connection I cannot indulge the delicacy of Baronius Valesius Tillemont c who almost reject a story so unworthy as they deem it of the gravity of ecclesiastical history  During the six years of persecution and exile Athanasius repeated his visits to his fair and faithful companion and the formal declaration that he  saw  the councils of Rimini and Seleucia  Athanas tom i p I agree with Tillemont tom viii p that his expressions imply a personal though perhaps secret visit to the synods  forces us to believe that he was secretly present at the time and place of their convocation The advantage of personally negociating with his friends and of observing and improving the divisions of his enemies might justify in a prudent statesman so bold and dangerous an enterprise and Alexandria was connected by trade and navigation with every seaport of the Mediterranean From the depth of his inaccessible retreat the intrepid primate waged an incessant and offensive war against the protector of the Arians and his seasonable writings which were diligently circulated and eagerly perused contributed to unite and animate the orthodox party In his public apologies which he addressed to the emperor himself he sometimes  affected the praise of moderation whilst at the same time in secret and vehement invectives he exposed Constantius as a weak and wicked prince the executioner of his family the tyrant of the republic and the antichrist of the church In the height of his prosperity the victorious monarch who had chastised the rashness of Gallus and suppressed the revolt of Sylvanus who had taken the diadem from the head of Vetranio and vanquished in the field the legions of Magnentius received from an invisible hand a wound which he could neither heal nor revenge and the son of Constantine was the first of the Christian princes who experienced the strength of those principles which in the cause of religion could resist the most violent exertions of the civil power  The Epistle of Athanasius to the Monks is filled with reproaches which the public must feel to be true vol i p and in compliment to his readers he has introduced the comparisons of Pharaoh Ahab Belshazzar c The boldness of Hilary was attended with less danger if he published his invective in Gaul after the revolt of Julian but Lucifer sent his libels to Constantius and almost challenged the reward of Martyrdom See Tillemont tom vii p    The persecution of Athanasius and of so many  Arian bishops  respectable bishops who suffered for the truth of their opinions or at least for the integrity of their conscience was a just subject of indignation and discontent to all Christians except those who were blindly devoted to the Arian faction The people regretted the loss of their faithful pastors whose banishment was usually followed by the intrusion  of a stranger  Athanasius tom i p complains in general of this practice which he afterwards exemplifies p in the pretended election of Faelix Three eunuchs represented the Roman people and three prelates who followed the court assumed the functions of the bishops of the Suburbicarian provinces  into the episcopal chair and loudly complained that the right of election was violated and that they were condemned to obey a mercenary usurper whose person was unknown and whose principles were suspected The Catholics might prove to the world that they were not involved in the guilt and heresy of their ecclesiastical governor by publicly testifying their  Divisions  dissent or by totally separating themselves from his communion The first of these methods was invented at Antioch and practised with such success that it was soon diffused over the Christian world The doxology or sacred hymn which celebrates the  glory  of the Trinity is susceptible of very nice but material inflexions and the substance of an orthodox or an heretical creed may be expressed by the difference of a disjunctive or a copulative particle Alternate responses and a more regular psalmody  Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom i l ii c p has collected many curious facts concerning the origin and progress of churchsinging both in the East and West  were introduced into the public service by Flavianus and Diodorus two devout and active laymen who were attached to the Nicene faith Under their conduct a swarm of Monks issued from the adjacent desert bands of welldisciplined singers were stationed in the cathedral of Antioch the Glory to the Father  AND the Son AND the Holy Ghost  Philostorgius l iii c Godefroy has examined this subject with singular accuracy p c There were three heterodox forms  "To the Father  by  the Son  and  in the Holy Ghost"  "To the Father  and  the Son  in  the Holy Ghost"  and  "To the Father  in  the Son  and  the Holy Ghost"  was triumphantly chanted by a full chorus of voices and the Catholics insulted by the purity of their doctrine the Arian prelate who had usurped the throne of the venerable Eustathius The same zeal which inspired their songs prompted the more scrupulous members of the orthodox party to form separate assemblies which were governed by the presbyters till the death of their exiled bishop allowed the election and consecration of a new episcopal pastor  After the exile of Eustathius under the reign of Constantine the rigid party of the orthodox formed a separation which afterwards degenerated into a chism and lasted above fourscore years See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p tom viii p In many churches the Arians and Homoousians who had renounced each other's  communion  continued for some time to join in prayer Philostorgius l iii c  The revolutions of the court multiplied the number of pretenders and the same city was often disputed under the reign of Constantius by two or three or even four bishops who exercised their spiritual jurisdiction over their respective followers and alternately lost and regained the temporal possessions of the church The abuse of Christianity introduced into the Roman government new causes of tyranny and sedition the bands of civil society were torn asunder by the fury of religious factions and the obscure citizen who might calmly have surveyed the elevation and fall of successive emperors  imagined and experienced that his own life and fortune were connected with the interests of a popular ecclesiastic The example of the two capitals Rome and Constantinople may serve to represent the state of the empire and the temper of mankind under the reign of the sons of Constantine  I The Roman pontiff as long as he maintained  Rome  his station and his principles was guarded by the warm attachment of a great people and could reject with scorn the prayers the menaces and the oblations of an heretical prince When the eunuchs had secretly pronounced the exile of Liberius the wellgrounded apprehension of a tumult engaged them to use the utmost precautions in the execution of the sentence The capital was invested on every side and the Praefect was commanded to seize the person of the bishop either by stratagem or by open force The order was obeyed and Liberius with the greatest difficulty at the hour of midnight was swiftly conveyed beyond the reach of the Roman people before their consternation was turned into rage As soon as they were informed of his banishment into Thrace a general assembly was convened and the clergy of Rome bound themselves by a public and solemn oath never to desert their bishop never to acknowledge the usurper Faelix who by the influence of the eunuchs had been irregularly chosen and consecrated within the walls of a profane palace At the end of two years their pious obstinacy subsisted entire and unshaken and when Constantius  visited Rome he was assailed by the importunate solicitations of a people who had preserved as the last remnant of their ancient freedom the right of treating their sovereign with familiar insolence The wives of many of the senators and most honourable citizens after pressing their husbands to intercede in favour of Liberius were advised to undertake a commission which in their hands would be less dangerous and might prove more successful The emperor received with politeness these female deputies whose wealth and dignity were displayed in the magnificence of their dress and ornaments he admired their inflexible resolution of following their beloved pastor to the most distant regions of the earth and consented that the two bishops Liberius and Faelix should govern in peace their respective congregations But the ideas of toleration were so repugnant to the practice and even to the sentiments of those times that when the answer of Constantius was publicly read in the Circus of Rome so reasonable a project of accommodation was rejected with contempt and ridicule The eager vehemence which animated the spectators in the decisive moment of a horserace was now directed towards a different object and the Circus resounded with the shout of thousands who repeatedly exclaimed  One God One Christ One Bishop  The zeal of the Roman people in the cause of Liberius was not confined to words alone and the dangerous and bloody sedition which they excited soon after the departure  of Constantius determined that prince to accept the submission of the exiled prelate and to restore him to the undivided dominion of the capital After some ineffectual resistance his rival was expelled from the city by the permission of the emperor and the power of the opposite faction the adherents of Faelix were inhumanly murdered in the streets in the public places in the baths and even in the churches and the face of Rome upon the return of a Christian bishop renewed the horrid image of the massacres of Marius and the proscriptions of Sylla  See on this ecclesiastical revolution of Rome Ammianus xv Athanas

under the reign of the Flavian family Rome  Constantinople  Alexandria and the other great cities of the empire still contained a strong and powerful faction of Infidels who envied the prosperity and who ridiculed even on their theatres the theological disputes of the church Constantinople alone enjoyed the advantage of being born and educated in the bosom of the faith The capital of the East had never been polluted by the worship of Idols and the whole body of the people had deeply imbibed the opinions the virtues and the passions which distinguished the Christians of that age from the rest of mankind After the death of Alexander the episcopal throne was disputed by Paul and Macedonius By their zeal  and abilities they both deserved the eminent station to which they aspired and if the moral character of Macedonius was less exceptionable his competitor had the advantage of a prior election and a more orthodox doctrine His firm attachment to the Nicene creed which has given Paul a place in the calendar among saints and martyrs exposed him to the resentment of the Arians In the space of fourteen years he was five times driven from his throne to which he was more frequently restored by the violence of the people than by the permission of the prince and the power of Macedonius could be secured only by the death of his rival The unfortunate Paul was dragged in chains from the sandy deserts of Mesopotamia to the most desolate places of Mount Taurus  Cucusus was the last stage of his life and sufferings The situation of that lonely town on the confines of Cappadocia Cilicia and the Lesser Armenia has occasioned some geographical perplexity but we are directed to the true spot by the course of the Roman road from Caesarea to Anazarbus See Cellarii Geograph tom ii p Wesseling ad Itinerar p  confined in a dark and narrow dungeon left six days without food and at length strangled by the order of Philip one of the principal ministers of the emperor Constantius  Athanasius tom i p affirms in the most positive terms that Paul was murdered and appeals not only to common fame but even to the unsuspicious testimony of Philagrius one of the Arian persecutors Yet he acknowledges that the heretics attributed to disease the death of the bishop of Constantinople Athanasius is servilely copied by Socrates l ii c but Sozomen who discovers a more liberal temper presumes l iv c to insinuate a prudent doubt  The first blood which stained the new capital was spilt in this ecclesiastical contest and many persons were slain on  both sides in the furious and obstinate seditions of the people The commission of enforcing a sentence of banishment against Paul had been entrusted to Hermogenes the mastergeneral of the cavalry but the execution of it was fatal to himself The Catholics rose in the defence of their bishop the palace of Hermogenes was consumed the first military officer of the empire was dragged by the heels through the streets of Constantinople and after he expired his lifeless corpse was exposed to their wanton insults  Ammianus xiv refers to his own account of this tragic event But we no longer possess that part of his history  The fare of Hermogenes instructed Philip the Praetorian praefect to act with more precaution on a similar ocsion In the most gentle and honourable terms he required the attendance of Paul in the baths of Zeuxippus which had a private communication with the palace and the sea A vessel which lay ready at the gardenstairs immediately hoisted fail and while the people were still ignorant of the meditated sacrilege their bishop was already embarked on his voyage to Thessalonica They soon beheld with surprise and indignation the gates of the palace thrown open and the usurper Macedonius seated by the side of the praefect on a lofty chariot which was surrounded by troops of guards with drawn swords The military procession advanced towards the cathedral the Arians and the Catholics eagerly rushed to occupy that important post and three thousand one hundred and fifty persons lost their lives in the confusion of  the tumult Macedonius who was supported by a regular force obtained a decisive victory but his reign was disturbed by clamour and sedition and the causes which appeared the least connected with the subject of dispute were sufficient to nourish and to kindle the flame of civil discord As the chapel in which the body of the great Constantine had been deposited was in a ruinous condition the bishop transported those venerable remains into the church of St Acacius This prudent and even pious measure was represented as a wicked profanation by the whole party which adhered to the Homoousian doctrine The factions immediately flew to arms the consecrated ground was used as their field of battle and one of the ecclesiastical historians has observed as a real fact not as a figure of rhetoric that the well before the church overflowed with a stream of blood which filled the porticoes and the adjacent courts The writer who should impute these tumults solely to a religious principle would betray a very imperfect knowledge of human nature yet it must be confessed that the motive which misled the sincerity of zeal and the pretence which disguised the licentiousness of passion suppressed the remorse which in another cause would have succeeded to the rage of the Christians of Constantinople  See Socrates l ii c and Sozomen l iii l iv c ii The acts of St Paul of Constantinople of which Photius has made an abstract Phot Bibliot p are an indifferent copy of these historians but a modern Greek who could write the life of a saint without adding fables and miracles is entitled to some commendation    The cruel and arbitrary disposition of Constantius which did not always require the provocations of guilt and resistance was justly exasperated  Cruelty of the Arians  by the tumults of his capital and the criminal behaviour of a faction which opposed the authority and religion of their sovereign The ordinary punishments of death exile and confiscation were inflicted with partial rigour and the Greeks still revere the holy memory of two clerks a reader and a subdeacon who were accused of the murder of Hermogenes and beheaded at the gates of Constantinople By an edict of Constantius against the Catholics which has not been judged worthy of a place in the Theodosian code those who refused to communicate with the Arian bishops and particularly with Macedonius were deprived of the immunities of ecclesiastics and of the rights of Christians they were compelled to relinquish the possession of the churches and were strictly prohibited from holding their assemblies within the walls of the city The execution of this unjust law in the provinces of Thrace and Asia Minor was committed to the zeal of Macedonius the civil and military powers were directed to obey his commands and the cruelties exercised by this SemiArian tyrant in the support of the  Homoiousion  exceeded the commission and disgraced the reign of Constantius The sacraments of the church were administered to the reluctant victims who denied the vocation and abhorred the principles of Macedonius The rites of baptism were conferred on women and children who for that purpose had been torn from  the arms of their friends and parents the mouths of the communicants were held open by a wooden engine while the consecrated bread was forced down their throat the breasts of tender virgins were either burnt with redhot eggshells or inhumanly compressed between sharp and heavy boards  Socrates l ii c Sozomen l iv c The principal assistants of Macedonius in the work of persecution were the two bishops of Nicomedia and Cyzicus who were esteemed for their virtues and especially for their charity I cannot forbear reminding the reader that the difference between the  Homoousion  and  Homoiousion  is almost invisible to the nicest theological eye  The Novatians of Constantinople and the adjacent country by their firm attachment to the Homoousian standard deserved to be confounded with the Catholics themselves Macedonius was informed that a large district of Paphlagonia  We are ignorant of the precise situation of Mantinium In speaking of these  four  bands of legionaries Socrates Sozomen and the author of the Acts of St Paul use the indesinite terms of  which Nicephorus very properly translates  thousands  Vales ad Socrat l ii c  was almost entirely inhabited by those sectaries He resolved either to convert or to extirpate them and as he distrusted on this occasion the efficacy of an ecclesiastical mission he commanded a body of four thousand legionaries to march against the rebels and to reduce the territory of Mantinium under his spiritual dominion The Novatian peasants animated by despair and religious fury boldly encountered the invaders of their country and though many of the Paphlagonians were slain the Roman legions were vanquished by an irregular multitude  armed only with scythes and axes and except a few who escaped by an ignominious flight four thousand soldiers were left dead on the field of battle The successor of Constantius has expressed in a concise but lively manner some of the theological calamities which afflicted the empire and more especially the East in the reign of a prince who was the slave of his own passions and of those of his eunuchs  Many were imprisoned and persecuted and driven into exile Whole troops of those who are stiled heretics were massacred particularly at Cyzicus and at Samosata In Paphlagonia Bithynia Galatia and in many other provinces towns and villages were laid waste and utterly destroyed  Julian Epistol lii p edit Spanheim    While the flames of the Arian controversy

and he has often though without design exposed the injuries which had provoked those fanatics  The severe execution of the laws of Constantine had excited a spirit of discontent and resistance the strenuous efforts of his son Constans to restore the unity of the church exasperated the sentiments of mutual hatred which had first occasioned the separation and the methods  of force and corruption employed by the two Imperial commissioners Paul and Macarius furnished the schismatics with a specious contrast between the maxims of the apostles and the conduct of their pretended successors  It is

who were imperfectly converted to the Christian faith but who were actuated by a blind and furious enthusiasm in the cause of their Donatist teachers They indignantly supported the exile of their bishops the demolition of their churches and the interruption of their secret assemblies The violence of the officers of justice who were usually sustained by a military guard was sometimes repelled with equal violence and the blood of some popular ecclesiastics which had been shed in the quarrel inflamed their rude followers with an eager desire of revenging the death of these holy martyrs By  their own cruelty and rashness the ministers of persecution sometimes provoked their fate and the guilt of an accidental tumult precipitated the criminals into despair and rebellion Driven from their native villages the Donatist peasants assembled in formidable gangs on the edge of the Getulian desert and readily exchanged the habits of labour for a life of idleness and rapine which was consecrated by the name of religion and faintly condemned by the doctors of the sect  The leaders of the Circumcellions assumed the assumed the title of captains of the saints their principal weapon as they were indifferently provided with swords and spears was a huge and weighty club which they termed an  Israelite  and the wellknown sound of "Praise be to God" which they used as their cry of war diffused consternation over the unarmed provinces of Africa  At first their depredations were coloured by the plea of necessity but they soon exceeded the measure of subsistence indulged without controul their intemperance and avarice burnt the villages which they had pillaged and reigned the licentious tyrants of the open country The occupations of husbandry and the administration of justice were interrupted and as the Circumcellions pretended to restore the primitive equality of mankind and to reform the abuses of civil society they opened a secure asylum for the slaves and debtors who flocked in crowds to their holy standard When they were not resisted they usually contented themselves with plunder but the slightest opposition provoked them to acts of  violence and murder and some Catholic priests who had imprudently signalized their zeal were tortured by the fanatics with the most refined and wanton barbarity The spirit of the Circumcellions was not always exerted against their defenceless enemies they engaged and sometimes defeated the troops of the province and in the bloody action of Bagai they attacked in the open field but with unsuccessful valour an advanced guard of the Imperial cavalry The Donatists who were taken in arms received and they soon deserved the same treatment which might have been shewn to the wild beasts of the desert The captives died without a murmur either by the sword the axe or the fire and the measures of retaliation were multiplied in a rapid proportion which aggravated the horrors of rebellion and excluded the hope of mutual forgiveness In the beginning of the present century the example of the Circumcellions has been renewed in the persecution the boldness the crimes and the enthusiasm of the Camisards and if the fanatics of Languedoc surpassed those of Numidia by their military atchievements the Africans maintained their fierce independence with more resolution and perseverance  The Histoire des Camisards in vol mo Villefranche may be recommended as accurate and impartial It requires some attention to discover the religion of the author    Such disorders are the natural effects of religious tyranny but the rage of the Donatists was inflamed  Their religious suicides  by a frenzy of a very extraordinary kind  and which if it really prevailed among them in so extravagant a degree cannot surely be paralleled in any country or in any age Many of these fanatics were possessed with the horror of life and the desire of martyrdom and they deemed it of little moment by what means or by what hands they perished if their conduct was sanctified by the intention of devoting themselves to the glory of the true faith and the hope of eternal happiness  The Donatist suicides alleged in their justification the example of Razias which is related in the th chapter of the second book of the Maccabees  Sometimes they rudely disturbed the festivals and profaned the temples of paganism with the design of exciting the most zealous of the idolaters to revenge the insulted honour of their gods They sometimes forced their way into the courts of justice and compelled the affrighted judge to give orders for their immediate execution They frequently stopped travellers on the public highways and obliged them to inflict the stroke of martyrdom by the promise of a reward if they consented and by the threat of instant death if they refused to grant so very singular a favour When they were disappointed of every other resource they announced the day on which in the presence of their friends and brethren they should cast themselves headlong from some lofty rock and many precipices were shewn which had acquired fame by the number of religious suicides In the actions of these desperate enthusiasts who were admired by one party as the martyrs of God and abhorred by  the other as the victims of Satan an impartial philosopher may discover the influence and the last abuse of that inflexible spirit which was originally derived from the character and principles of the Jewish nation  The simple narrative of the intestine divisions  General character of the Christian sects  which distracted the peace and dishonoured the triumph of the church will confirm the remark of a pagan historian and justify the complaint of a  A D  venerable bishop The experience of Ammianus had

Nazianzen Orat i p See Tillemont tom vi p quarto edit  The fierce and partial writers of the times ascribing  all  virtue to themselves and imputing  all  guilt to their adversaries have painted the battle of the angels and daemons Our calmer reason will reject such pure and perfect monsters of vice or sanctity and will impute an equal or at least an indiscriminate measure of good and evil to the hostile sectaries who assumed and bestowed the appellations of orthodox and heretics They had been educated in the same religion and the same civil society Their hopes and fears in the present or in a future life were balanced in the same proportion On either side the error might be innocent  the faith sincere the practice meritorious or corrupt Their passions were excited by similar objects and they might alternately abuse the favour of the court or of the people The metaphysical opinions of the Athanasians and the Arians could not influence their moral character and they were alike actuated by the intolerant spirit which has been extracted from the pure and simple maxims of the gospel  A modern writer who with a just confidence  Toleration of paganism  has prefixed to his own history the honourable epithets of political and philosophical  Histoire Politique et Philosophique des Etablissemens des Européens dans les deux Indes tom i p  accuses the timid prudence of Montesquieu for neglecting to enumerate among the causes of the decline of the empire a law of Constantine by which the exercise of the pagan worship was absolutely suppressed and a considerable part of his subjects was left destitute of priests of temples and of any public religion The zeal of the philosophic historian for the rights of mankind has induced him to acquiesce in the ambiguous testimony of those ecclesiastics who have too lightly ascribed to their favourite hero the  merit  of a general persecution  According to Eusebius in Vit Constantin l ii c the emperor prohibited both in cities and in the country  the abominable acts or parts of idolatry Socrates l i c and Sozomen l ii c have represented the conduct of Constantine with a just regard to truth and history which has been neglected by Theodoret l v c and Orosius vii Tum deinde says the latter primus Constantinus  justo  ordine et  pio  vicem vertit edicto siquidem statuit citra ullam hominum caedem paganorum templa claudi  Instead of alleging this imaginary  law which would have blazed in the front of the Imperial codes we may safely appeal to the original epistle which Constantine addressed to the followers of the ancient religion at a time when he no longer disguised his conversion nor dreaded the rivals of his throne He invites and exhorts in the most pressing terms the subjects of the Roman empire to imitate the example of their master but he declares that those who still refuse  by Constantine  to open their eyes to the celestial light may freely enjoy their temples and their fancied gods A report that the ceremonies of paganism were suppressed is formally contradicted by the emperor himself who wisely assigns as the principle of his moderation the invincible force of habit of prejudice and of superstition  See Eusebius in Vit Constantin l ii c In the sermon to the assembly of saints which the emperor pronounced when he was mature in years and piety he declares to the idolaters c xi that they are permitted to offer sacrifices and to exercise every part of their religious worship  Without violating the sanctity of his promise without alarming the fears of the pagans the artful monarch advanced by slow and cautious steps to undermine the irregular and decayed fabric of polytheism The partial acts of severity which he occasionally exercised though they were secretly prompted by a Christian zeal were coloured by the fairest pretences of justice and the public good and while Constantine designed to ruin the foundations he seemed to reform the abuses of the ancient religion After the example  of the wisest of his predecessors he condemned under the most rigorous penalties the occult and impious arts of divination which excited the vain hopes and sometimes the criminal attempts of those who were discontented with their present condition An ignominious silence was imposed on the oracles which had been publicly convicted of fraud and falsehood the effeminate priests of the Nile were abolished and Constantine discharged the duties of a Roman censor when he gave orders for the demolition of several temples of Phoenicia in which every mode of prostitution was devoutly practised in the face of day and to the honour of Venus  See Eusebius in Vit Constantin l iii c and l iv c These acts of authority may be compared with the suppression of the Bacchanals and the demolition of the temple of Isis by the magistrates of Pagan Rome  The Imperial city of Constantinople was in some measure raised at the expence and was adorned with the spoils of the opulent temples of Greece and Asia the sacred property was confiscated the statues of gods and heroes were transported with rude familiarity among a people who considered them as objects not of adoration but of curiosity the gold and silver were restored to circulation and the magistrates the bishops and the eunuchs improved the fortunate occasion of gratifying at once their zeal their avarice and their resentment But these depredations were confined to a small part of the Roman world and the provinces had been long since accustomed to  endure the same sacrilegious rapine from the tyranny of princes and proconsuls who could not be suspected of any design to subvert the established religion  Eusebius in Vit Constant l iii c and Libanius Oratpro Templis p edit Gothofred both mention the pious sacrilege of Constantine which they viewed in very different lights The latter expressly declares that  he made use of the sacred money but made no alteration in the legal worship the temples indeed were impoverished but the sacred rites were performed there  Lardner's Jewish and Heathen Testimonies vol iv p    The sons of Constantine trod in the footsteps of  and his sons  their father with more zeal and with less discretion The pretences of rapine and oppression were insensibly multiplied  Ammianus xxii speaks of some court eunuchs who were spoliis templorum pasti Libanius says Orat pro Templ p that the emperor often gave away a temple like a dog or a horse or a slave or a gold cup but the devout philosopher takes care to observe that these sacrilegious favourites very seldom prospered  every indulgence was shewn to the illegal behaviour of the Christians every doubt was explained to the disadvantage of paganism and the demolition of the temples was celebrated as one of the auspicious events of the reign of Constans and Constantius  See Gothofred Cod Theodos tom vi p Liban Orat Parental c x in Fabric Bibl Graec tom vii p  The name of Constantius is prefixed to a concise law which might have superseded the necessity of any future prohibitions  It is our pleasure that in all places and in all cities the temples be immediately shut and carefully guarded that none may have the power of offending It is likewise our pleasure that all  our subjects should abstain from sacrifices If any one should be guilty of such an act let him feel the sword of vengeance and after his execution let his property be confiscated to the public use We denounce the same penalties against the governors of the provinces if they neglect to punish the criminals  Placuit omnibus locis atque urbibus universis claudi protinus templa et accessu vetitis omnibus licentiam delinquendi perditis abnegari Volumus etiam cunctos a sacrificiis abstinere Quod siquis aliquid forte hujusmodi perpetraverit gladio sternatur facultates etiam perempti fisco decernimus vindicari et similiter adfligi rectores provinciarum si facinora vindicare neglexerint Cod Theodos l xvi tit x leg Chronology has discovered some contradiction in the date of this extravagant law the only one perhaps by which the negligence of magistrates is punished by death and confiscation M de la Bastie Mem de l'Academie tom xv p conjectures with a shew of reason that this was no more than the minutes of a law the heads of an intended bill which were found in Scriniis Memoriae among the papers of Constantius and afterwards inserted a worthy model in the Theodosian Code    But there is the strongest reason to believe that this formidable edict was either composed without being published or was published without being executed The evidence of facts and the monuments which are still extant of brass and marble continue to prove the public exercise of the pagan worship during the whole reign of the sons of Constantine In the East as well as in the West in cities as well as in the country a great number of temples were respected or at least were spared and the devout multitude still enjoyed the luxury of sacrifices of festivals and of processions by the permission or by the connivance of the civil government About four years after the supposed date of his  bloody edict Constantius visited the temples of Rome and the decency of his behaviour is recommended by a pagan orator as an example worthy of the imitation of succeeding princes  That emperor says Symmachus suffered the privileges of the vestal virgins to remain inviolate he bestowed the sacerdotal dignities on the nobles of Rome granted the customary allowance to defray the expences of the public rites and sacrifices and though he had embraced a different religion he never attempted to deprive the empire of the sacred worship of antiquity  Symmach Epistol x    The senate still presumed to consecrate by solemn decrees the  divine  memory of their sovereigns and Constantine himself was associated after his death to those gods whom he had renounced and insulted during his life The title the ensigns the prerogatives of SOVEREIGN PONTIFF which had been instituted by Numa and assumed by Augustus were accepted without hesitation by seven Christian emperors who were invested with a more absolute authority over the religion which they had deserted than over that which they professed  The fourth Dissertation of M de la Bastie sur le Souverain Pontificat des Empereurs Romains in the Mem de l'Acad tom xv p is a very learned and judicious performance which explains the state and proves the toleration of paganism from Constantine to Gratian The assertion of Zosimus that Gratian was the first who refused the pontifical robe is confirmed beyond a doubt and the murmurs of bigotry on that subject are almost silenced    The divisions of Christianity suspended the ruin of  paganism  As I have freely anticipated the use of  pagans  and paganism I shall now trace the singular revolutions of those celebrated words  in the Doric dialect so familiar to the Italians signifies a fountain and the rural neighbourhood which frequented the same fountain derived the common appellation of  pagus  and  pagans  Eestus sub voce and Servius ad Virgil Georgic ii By an easy extension of the word  pagan  and rural became almost synonymous Plin Hist Natur xxviii and the meaner rustics acquired that name which has been corrupted into  peasants  in the modern languages of Europe The amazing increase of the military order introduced the necessity of a correlative term Hume's Essays vol i p and all the  people  who were not enlisted in the service of the prince were branded with the contemptuous epithet of pagans Tacit Hist iii Juvenal Satir xvi Tertullian de Pallio c The Christians were the soldiers of Christ their adversaries who refused his  sacrament  or military oath of baptism might deserve the metaphorical name of pagans and this popular reproach was introduced as early as the reign of Valentinian A D into Imperial laws Cod Theodos l xvi tit ii leg and theological writings Christianity gradually filled the cities of the empire the old religion in the time of Prudentius advers Symmachum l i ad fin and Orosius in Praefat Hist retired and languished in obscure villages and the word  pagans  with its new signification reverted to its primitive origin Since the worship of Jupiter and his family has expired the vacant title of pagans has been successively applied to all the idolaters and polytheists of the old and new world The Latin Christians bestowed it without scruple on their mortal enemies the Mahometans and the purest  unitarians  were branded

worship of an image The peculiar idiom of the Hellenists or Grecian Jews has been adopted by the sacred and ecclesiastical writers and the reproach of  idolatry    has stigmatized that visible and abject mode of superstition which some sects of Christianity should not hastily impute to the polytheists of Greece and Rome  might have been  justified by the established principles of intolerance but the hostile sects which alternately reigned in the Imperial court were mutually apprehensive of alienating and perhaps exasperating the minds of a powerful though declining faction Every motive of authority and fashion of interest and reason now militated on the side of Christianity but two or three generations elapsed before their victorious influence was universally felt The religion which had so long and so lately been established in the Roman empire was still revered by a numerous people less attached indeed to speculative opinion than to ancient custom The honours of the state and army were indifferently bestowed on all the subjects of Constantine and Constantius and a considerable portion of knowledge and wealth and valour was still engaged in the service of polytheism The superstition of the senator and of the peasant of the poet and the philosopher was derived from very different causes but they met with equal devotion in the temples of the gods Their zeal was insensibly provoked by the insulting triumph of a proscribed sect and their hopes  were revived by the wellgrounded confidence that the presumptive heir of the empire a young and valiant hero who had delivered Gaul from the arms of the Barbarians had secretly embraced the religion of his ancestors  END OF THE THIRD VOLUME  map of eastern Roman Empire  A MAP  of the EASTERN PART  of the ROMAN
