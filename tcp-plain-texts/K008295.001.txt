 THE RAMBLER  VOLUME THE FIRST  HOR  LONDON  Printed for J PAYNE and J BOUQUET IN PATERNOSTERROW MDCCLII  THE RAMBLER  NUMB  TUESDAY  March    Cur tamen hoc libeat potius decurrere campo  Per quem magnus equos Auruncae flexit alumnus  Si vacat et placidi rationem admittitis edam  JUV  THE difficulty of the first address on any new occasion is felt by every man in his transactions with the world and confessed by the settled and regular forms of salutation which necessity has introduced into all languages Judgment was wearied with the inextricable perplexity of being forced upon choice where there was no motive to preference and it was found convenient that some easy method of introduction should be established which if it wanted the allurement of novelty might enjoy in its place the security of prescription  PERHAPS few authors have presented themselves  before the publick without wishing that such ceremonial modes of entrance had been anciently established as might have freed them from the dangers which the too ardent desire of pleasing is certain to produce and procluded the vain expedients of softening censure by apologies and rousing attention by abruptness  THE epic writers indeed have found the proemial part of the poem such an addition to their laborious undertaking that they have almost unanimously adopted the first lines of Homer and the reader needs only be informed of the subject to know in what manner the scene will open  BUT this solemn repetition is hitherto the peculiar distinction of heroic poetry and has never been legally extended to the lower orders of literature but seems to be considered as an hereditary privilege to be enjoyed only by those who can claim it from their alliance to the genius of Homer  THE rules which an observation of the injudicious use of this prerogative suggested to Horace may indeed be applied to the direction  of candidates for inferior fame and it may be proper for all to remember that they ought not to raise expectation which it is not in their power to satisfy and that it is more pleasing to see smoke gradually brightening into flame than flame sinking into smoke  YET tho' this precept has been long received both from regard to the authority of him that delivered it and its conformity to the general opinion of the world there have been some as well since as before his time who have thought it no deviation from modesty to recommend their own labours and imagined themselves entitled by indisputable merit to an exemption from general restraints and to elevations not allowed in common life They perhaps believed that when like Thucydides they bequeathed to mankind    an estate for ever  it was an additional favour to inform them of its value  IT may indeed be no less dangerous to claim on certain occasions too little than too much There is something captivating in spirit and intrepidity to which we often yield as to a resistless power nor can he reasonably expect  the confidence of others who too apparently distrusts himself  PLUTARCH in his enumeration of the various occasions on which a man may without just offence proclaim his own excellencies has omitted the case of an author entering the world unless it may be comprehended under his general position that a man may lawfully praise himself for those qualities which cannot be known but from his own mouth as when he is among strangers and can probably have no opportunity of an actual exertion of his powers That the case of an author is parallel will scarecely be granted because he necessarily discovers the degree of his merit to his judges when he solicits their suffrages But it should be remembered that unless his judges be prejudiced in his favour they will not be persuaded to hear the cause  IN love the state which fills the heart with a degree of solicitude next that of an author it has been held a maxim that success is most easily obtained by indirect and concealed approaches he who too soon professes himself a lover raises obstacles to his own wishes and those whom disappointments have taught  experience endeavour to conceal their passion till they believe that their mistress wishes for the discovery The same method if it were practicable to writers would save many complaints of the partiality of the world the severity of the age and the caprices of criticism If a man could glide imperceptibly into the favour of the publick and only proclaim his pretensions to literary honours when he is sure of not being rejected he might commence author with better hopes as his failings might escape contempt though he shall never attain excellence sufficient to excite much regard  BUT since the publick supposes every man that writes ambitious of applause as some ladies have taught themselves to believe that every man intends love who expresses civility the miscarrige of any new endeavour in learning raises an unbounded contempt indulged by most minds without scruple as an honest triumph over unjust claims and exorbitant expectations The artisices of those who put themselves in this hazardous state have therefore been multiplied in proportion to their fear as well as their ambition and are to be looked upon with more indulgence as they result from complicated passions and are incited  at once by the two great movers of the human mind the desire of good and the fear of evil For who can wonder that thus allured on one side and frightned on the other some men should endeavour to gain favour by bribing the judge with an appearance of respect which they do not feel to excite compassion by confessing weakness of which they are not convinced or to attract regard by a shew of openness and magnanimity by a daring profession of their own deserts and a publick challenge of honours and rewards  THE ostentatious and haughty display of themselves has been the usual refuge of diurnal writers in vindication of whose practice it may be said that what it wants in prudence is supplied by sincerity and who at least may plead that if their boasts deceive any into the perusal of their performances they defraud them of but little time  Quid enim Concurriturhorae  Momento cita mors venit aut victoria laeta  The question concerning the merit of the day is soon decided and we are not condemned  to toil thro' half a folio to be convinced that the writer has broke his promise  IT is one among many reasons for which I purpose to endeavour the entertainment of my countrymen by a short essay on Tuesday and Saturday that I hope not much to tire those whom I shall not happen to please and if I am not commended for the beauty of my works to be at least pardoned for their brevity but whether my expectations are most fixed on pardon or praise I think it not necessary to discover for having accurately weighed the reasons for arrogance and submission I find them so nearly equiponderant that my impatience to try the event of my first performance will not suffer me to attend any longer the trepidation of the balance  THERE are indeed many conveniencies almost peculiar to this method of publication which may naturally flatter the author whether he be confident or timorous The man to whom the extent of his knowledge or the sprightliness of his imagination has in his own opinion already secured the praises of the world willingly takes that way of displaying his abilities which will soonest give him an opportunity  of hearing the voice of fame and it heightens his alacrity to think in how many places he shall hear what he is now writing read with ecstasies to morrow He will often please himself with reflecting that the author of a large treatise must proceed with anxiety lest before the completion of his work the attention of the publick may have changed its object but that he who is confined to no single subject may follow the national taste through all its variations and catch the Aura popularis the gale of favour from what point soever it shall blow  NOR is the prospect less likely to ease the doubts of the cautious and allay the terrours of the fearful for to such the shortness of every single paper is a powerful encouragement He that questions his abilities to arrange the dissimilar parts of an extensive plan or fears to be lost in a complicated system may yet hope to adjust a few pages without perplexity and if when he turns over the repositories of his memory he finds his collection too small for a volume he may yet have enough to furnish out an essay He that is afraid of laying out too much time upon an experiment of which he fears the event persuades himself that a few  days will shew him what he is to expect from his learning and his genius If he thinks his own judgment not sufficiently enlightned he may by attending the remarks which every paper will produce inform himself of his mistakes rectify his opinions and extend his views If he suspects that he may with too little premeditation encumber himself by an unwieldy subject he may quit it without confessing his ignorance and pass to other topicks less dangerous or more tractable And if he finds with all his industry and all his artifices that he cannot deserve regard or cannot attain it he may let the design fall at once and without injury to others or himself retire to amusements of greater pleasure or to studies of better prospect  NUMB  SATURDAY  March    Stare loco nescit pereunt vestigia mille  Ante fugam absentemque serit gravis ungula campum  STATIUS  THAT the mind of man is never satisfied with the objects before it but is always breaking away from the present moment and losing itself in schemes of future selicity that we forget the proper use of the time now in our power to provide for the enjoyment of that which perhaps may never be granted us has been frequently remarked and as this practice is a very commodious subject of raillery to the gay and of declamation to the serious it has been ridiculed with all the pleasantry of wit and exaggerated with all the amplifications of rhetoric Every instance by which its absurdity might appear most flagrant has been studiously collected it has been marked with every epithet of contempt and all the tropes and figures have been called forth against it  CENSURE is willingly indulged because it  always implies some superiority men please themselves with imagining that they have made a deeper search or wider survey than others and detected faults and follies which escaped vulgar observation And the pleasure of wantoning in common topicks is so tempting to a writer that he cannot easily resign it a train of sentiments generally received enables him to shine without labour and to conquer without a contest It is so easy to laugh at the folly of him who lives only in idea refuses immediate ease or distant pleasures and instead of enjoying the blessings of life lets life glide away in preparations to enjoy them it affords such opportunities of triumphant exultations to exemplify the uncertainty of human state to rouse mortals from their dream and inform them of the silent celerity of time that we may reasonably believe most authors willing rather to transmit than examine so advantageous a principle and more inclined to pursue a track so smooth and so flowery than attentively to consider whether it leads to truth  THIS quality of looking forward into futurity seems the unavoidable and necessary condition  of a being whose motions are gradual and whose life is progressive as his powers are limited he must use means for the attainment of his ends and must intend first what he performs last as by continual advances from his first stage of existence he is perpetually varying the horizon of his prospects he must always discover new motives of action new excitements of fear and allurements of desire  THE end therefore which at present calls forth our efforts will be found when it is once gained to be only one of the means to some remoter end and the natural flights of the human mind are not from pleasure to pleasure but from hope to hope  HE that directs his steps to a certain point must frequently turn his eyes to that place which he strives to reach he that undergoes the fatigue of labour must solace his weariness with the contemplation of its reward In agriculture one of the most simple and necessary employments no man turns up the ground but because he thinks of the harvest that harvest which blights may intercept which inundations  may sweep away or which death or calamity may hinder him from reaping  YET as few maxims are widely received or long retained but for some conformity with truth and nature it must be confessed that this caution against keeping our view too intent upon remote advantages is not without its propriety or usefulness though it may have been inclucated with too much levity or inforced with too little distinction for not to speak of that vehemence of desire which presses through right and wrong to its gratification or that anxious inquietude which is justly chargeable with distrust of heaven subjects too solemn for my present purpose it very frequently happens that by indulging too early the raptures of success we forget the measures necessary to secure it and suffer the imagination to riot in the fruition of some possible good till the time of obtaining it has slipped away  THERE would however perhaps be few enterprises either of great labour or hazard undertaken if we had not the power of magnifying the advantages which we persuade  ourselves to expect from them and when the knight of La Mancha gravely recounts to his companion the adventures by which he is to signalize himself in such a manner that he shall be summoned to the support of empires sollicited to accept the heiress of the crown he has preserved have honours and riches to scatter about him and an island to bestow on his worthy squire very few readers amidst their mirth or their pity can deny that they have admitted visions of the same kind though they have not perhaps expected events equally strange nor by means equally inadequate When we pity him we reflect on our own disappointments and when we laugh our hearts inform us that he is not more ridiculous than ourselves except that he tells what we only thought  THE understanding of a man naturally sanguine may indeed be easily vitiated by too luxurious an indulgence of the pleasures of hope however generally necessary to the production of every thing great or excellent as some plants are destroyed by too open exposure to that sun which gives life and beauty to the vegetable world  PERHAPS no class of the human species requires more to be cautioned against this anticipation of happiness than those that aspire to the name of authors A man of lively fancy no sooner finds a hint moving in his mind than he makes momentaneous excursions to the press and to the world and with a little encouragement from flattery pushes forward into future ages and prognosticates the honours to be paid him when envy is extinct and faction is forgotten and those whom the partiality of the present generation suffers to obscure him shall give way to other trifles of as short duration as themselves  THOSE who have proceeded so far as to appeal to the tribunal of succeeding times are indeed not likely to be cured of their infatuation but all endeavours ought to be used for the prevention of a disease for which when it has attained its height perhaps no remedy will be found in the gardens of philosophy however she may boast her physick of the mind her catharticks of vice or her antidotes to passion  I SHALL therefore while I am yet but lightly touched with the symptoms of the  writer's malady endeavour to fortify myself against the infection not without some weak hope that my preservatives may extend their virtue to others whose employment exposes them to the same danger  Laudis amore tumes Sunt certa piacula quae te  Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello  IT is the sage advice of Epictetus that a man should accustom himself often to think of what is most shocking and terrible that by such reflexions he may be preserved from too ardent wishes for seeming good and from too much dejection in real evil  THERE is nothing more dreadful to an author than neglect compared with which reproach and hatred and opposition are names of happiness yet this worst this meanest fate every man who dares to write has reason to fear  I nunc et versus tecum meditare canoros  IT may not be unfit for him who makes a new entrance into the lettered world so far to suspect his own powers as to believe that he possibly may deserve neglect that nature may  not have qualified him much to enlarge or embellish knowledge nor sent him forth entitled by indisputable superiority to regulate the conduct of the rest of mankind that though the world must be granted to be yet in ignorance he is not destined to dispel the cloud nor to shine out as one of the luminaries of life for this suspicion every catalogue of authors will furnish sufficient reason as he will find it crouded with names of men who though now forgotten were once no less enterprising or confident than himself equally pleased with their own productions equally caressed by their patrons and flattered by their friends  BUT though it should happen that an author is capable of excelling in his province yet his merit may pass without notice huddled in the variety of things and thrown into the general miscellany of life He that endeavours after fame by writing solicits the regard of a multitude fluctuating in pleasures or immersed in business without time for intellectual amusements he appeals to judges prepossessed by passions or corrupted by prejudices which preclude their approbation of any new performance Some are too indolent  to read any thing till its reputation is establish'd others too envious to promote that fame which gives them pain by its increase What is new is opposed because most are unwilling to be taught and what is known is rejected because it is not sufficiently considered that men more frequently require to be reminded than informed The learned are afraid to declare their opinion early lest they should put their reputation in hazard the ignorant always imagine themselves giving some proof of delicacy when they refuse to be pleased and he therefore that finds his way to reputation through all these obstructions must acknowledge that he is indebted to other causes besides his industry his learning or his wit  NUMB  TUESDAY  March    VIRTUS  repulsae nescia sordidae  Intaminatis fulget honoribus  Nec sumit aut ponit secures  Arbitrio popularis aurae  HOR  THE task of an author is either to teach what is not known or to recommend known truths by his manner of adorning them either to let new light in upon the mind and open new scenes to the prospect or to vary the dress and situation of common objects so as to give them fresh grace and more powerful attractions to spread such flowers over the regions through which the intellect has already made its progress as may tempt it to return and take a second view of things too hastily passed over or too negligently regarded  EITHER of these labours is very difficult because that they may not be fruitless men must not only be persuaded of their errors but reconciled to their guide they must not only confess their ignorance but what is still less pleasing must allow that he from whom they  are to learn is more knowing than themselves  IT might be imagined that such an employment was in itself sufficiently irksome and hazardous and that none would be found so malevolent as wantonly to add weight to the stone of Sisyphus It might be hoped that few endeavours would be used to obstruct those advances to reputation which must be made at such an expence of time and thought and by such slow degrees with so great hazard in the miscarriage and with so little advantage from the success  YET there is a certain race of men that either imagine it their duty or make it their amusement to hinder the reception of every work of learning or of genius who stand as centinels in the avenues of fame and value themselves upon giving IGNORANCE and ENVY the first notice of a new prey  TO these men who distinguish themselves by the appellation of CRITICKS it is necessary for a new author to find some means of recommendation It is probable that the most malignant of these persecutors might be somewhat softened and prevailed on for a  short time to remit their fury For this purpose having considered many expedients I find in the records of ancient times that ARGUS was lulled by music and CERBERUS quieted with a sop and am therefore inclined to believe that modern criticks who if they have not the eyes have the watchfulness of ARGUS and can bark as loud as CERBERUS though perhaps they may not bite with equal force might be subdued by methods of the same kind I have heard how some have been pacified with claret and a supper and others laid asleep by the soft notes of flattery  THOUGH the nature of my undertaking gives me sufficient reason to dread the united attacks of this virulent generation yet I have not hitherto persuaded myself to take any measures for flight or treaty For I am in doubt whether they can act against me by lawful authority whether they have not presumed upon a forged commission stiled themselves the ministers of CRITICISM without being able to produce any authentic evidence of delegation and uttered their own determinations as the decrees of a higher judicature  CRITICISM from whom they derive their  claim to decide the fate of writers was the eldest daughter of LABOUR and of TRUTH she was at her birth committed to the care of JUSTICE and brought up by her in the palace of WISDOM Being soon distinguished by the celestials for her uncommon qualities she was appointed the governess of FANCY and impowered to beat time to the chorus of the MUSES when they sung before the throne of JUPITER  WHEN the MUSES condescended to visit this lower world they came accompanied by CRITICISM to whom upon her descent from her native regions JUSTICE gave a scepter to be carried aloft in her right hand one end of which was tinctured with ambrosia and inwreathed with a golden foliage of amaranths and bays the other end was incircled with cypress and poppies and dipped in the waters of oblivion In her left hand she bore an unextinguishable torch the manufacture of LABOUR and lighted by TRUTH of which it was the particular quality to diffuse its radiance in such a manner as immediately to shew every thing in its true form however it might be disguised to common eyes Whatever ART could complicate or FOLLY could confound  was upon the first gleam of the torch of TRUTH exhibited in its distinct parts and original simplicity it darted through all the labyrinths of sophistry and shewed at once all the absurdities to which they served for refuge it pierced through the robes which rhetorick often sold to falsehood and detected the disproportion of parts which artificial veils had been contrived to cover  THUS furnished for the execution of her office CRITICISM camedown to survey the performances of those who professed themselves the votaries of the MUSES Whatever was brought before her she beheld by the steady light of the torch of TRUTH and when her examination had convinced her that the laws of just writing had been observed she touched it with the amaranthine end of the scepter and consigned it over to immortality  BUT it more frequently happened that in the works which required her inspection there was some imposture attempted that false colours were laboriously laid upon particular parts that some secret inequality was sound between the words and sentiments or some dissimilitude of the ideas and the original  objects that incongruities were linked together or that some parts were of no use but to enlarge the appearance of the whole without contributing to its beauty its solidity or its usefulness  WHEREVER such discoveries were made and they were made whenever these faults were committed CRITICISM refused the touch which conferred the sanction of immortality and when the errors were frequent and gross reversed the scepter and let the drops of Lethe distil from the poppies and cypress a fatal mildew which immediately began to waste the work away till it was at last totally destroyed  THERE were frequently some compositions brought to the test in which when the strongest light was thrown upon them their beauties and faults appeared so equally mingled that CRTICISM stood with her scepter poised in her hand in doubt whether to shed the drops of oblivion or ambrosia upon them These at last increased to so great a number that she was weary of attending such doubtful claims and for fear of using improperly the  scepter of JUSTICE referred the cause to be considered by TIME  THE proceedings of TIME though very dilatory were some few caprices excepted conformable to JUSTICE and many who thought themselves secure by a short forbearance have sunk under his scythe as they were posting down with their volumes in triumph to futurity It was observable that some were destroyed by little and little and others crushed for ever by a single blow  CRITICISM having long kept her eye fixt steadily upon TIME was at last so well satisfied with his conduct that she withdrew from the earth with her patroness ASTREA and left PREJUDICE and FALSETASTE to ravage at large with FRAUD and MISCHIEF contenting herself thenceforth to shed her influence from afar upon some select minds sitted for its reception by learning and by virtue  BEFORE her departure she broke her scepter of which the shivers that formed the ambrosial end were caught up by FLATTERY and those that had been infected with the waters of  with equal haste  by MALEVOLENCE  The followers of FLATTERY to whom she distributed her part of the scepter neither had nor desired light but touched indiscriminately whatever POWER or INTEREST happened to exhibit The companions of MALEVOLENCE were supplied by the FURIES with a torch which had this quality peculiar to infernal lustre that its light fell only upon faults  No light but rather darkness visible  Serv'd only to discover sights of woe  WITH these fragments of authority the slaves of FLATTERY and MALEVOLENCE marched out at the command of their mistresses to confer immortality or condemn to oblivion But the scepter had now lost its power and TIME passes his sentence at leisure without any regard to their determinations  NUMB  SATURDAY  March    Simul et jucunda et idonea dicere Vitae  HOR  THE works of fiction with which the present generation seems more particularly delighted are such as exhibit life in its true state diversified only by the accidents that daily happen in the world and influenced by those passions and qualities which are really to be found in conversing with mankind  THIS kind of writing may be termed not improperly the comedy of romance and is to be conducted nearly by the rules of comic poetry Its province is to bring about natural eventby easy means and to keep up curiosity without the help of wonder it is therefore precluded from the machines and expedients of the heroic romance and can neither employ giants to snatch away a lady from the nuptial rites nor knights to bring her back from captivity it can neither bewilder its personages in desarts nor lodge them in imaginary castles  I REMEMBER a remark made by Scaliger upon Pontanus that all his writings are filled  with the same images and that if you take from him his lillies and his roses his satyrs and his dryads he will have nothing left that can be called poetry In like manner almost all the fictions of the last age will vanish if you deprive them of a hermit and a wood a battle and a shipwreek  WHY this wild strain of imagination found reception so long in polite and learned ages it is not easy to conceive but we cannot wonder that while readers could be procured the authors were willing to continue it for when a man had by practice gained some fluency of language he had no farther care than to retire to his closet let loose his invention and heat his mind with incredibilities and a book was produced without fear of criticism without the toil of study without knowledge of nature or acquaintance with life  THE task of our present writers is very different it requires together with that learning which is to be gained from books that experience which can never be attained by solitary diligence but must arise from general converse and accurate observation of the living world Their performances have as Horace expresses  it  plus oneris quantum veniae minus  little indulgence and therefore more difficulty They are engaged in portraits of which every one knows the original and can therefore detect any deviation from exactness of resemblance Other writings are safe except from the malice of learning but these are in danger from every common reader as the slipper ill executed was censured by a shoemaker who happened to stop in his way at the Venus of Apelles  BUT the danger of not being approved as just copyers of human manners is not the most important apprehension that an author of this sort ought to have before him These books are writen chiefly to the young the ignorant and the idle to whom they serve as lectures of conduct and introductions into life They are the entertainment of minds unfurnished with ideas and therefore easily susceptible of impressions not fixed by principles and therefore easily following the current of fancy not informed by experience and consequently open to every false suggestion and partial account  THAT the highest degree of reverence should be paid to youth and that nothing indecent  or unseemly should be suffered to approach their eyes or ears are precepts extorted by sense and virtue from an ancient writer by no means eminent for chastity of thought The same kind tho' not the same degree of caution is required in every thing which is laid before them to secure them from unjust prejudices perverse opinions and improper combinations of images  IN the romances formerly written every transaction and sentiment was so remote from all that passes among men that the reader was in very little danger of making any applications to himself the virtues and crimes were equally beyond his sphere of activity and he amused himself with heroes and with traitors deliverers and persecutors as with beings of another species whose actions were regulated upon motives of their own and who had neither faults nor excellencies in common with himself  BUT when an adventurer is levelled with the rest of the world and acts in such scenes of the universal drama as may be the lot of any other man young spectators fix their eyes upon him with closer attention and hope by  observing his behaviour and success to regulate their own practices when they shall be engaged in the like part  FOR this reason these familiar histories may perhaps be made of greater use than the solemnities of professed morality and convey the knowledge of vice and virtue with more efficacy than axioms and definitions But if the power of example is so great as to take possession of the memory by a kind of violence and produce effects almost without the intervention of the will care ought to be taken that when the choice is unrestrained the best examples only should be exhibited and that which is likely to operate so strongly should not be mischievous or uncertain in its effects  THE chief advantage which these fictions have over real life is that their authors are at liberty tho' not to invent yet to select objects and to cull from the mass of mankind those individuals upon which the attention ought most to be employ'd as a diamond though it cannot be made may be polished by art and placed in such a situation as to display that lustre which before was buried among common stones  IT is justly considered as the greatest excellency of art to imitate nature but it is necessary to distinguish those parts of nature which are most proper for imitation greater care is still required in representing life which is so often discoloured by passion or deformed by wickedness If the world be promiscuously described I cannot see of what use it can be to read the account or why it may not be as safe to turn the eye immediately upon mankind as upon a mirror which shows all that presents itself without discrimination  IT is therefore not a sufficient vindication of a character that it is drawn as it appears for many characters ought never to be drawn nor of a narrative that the train of events is agreeable to observation and experience for that observation which is called knowledge of the world will be found much more frequently to make men cunning than good The purpose of these writings is surely not only to show mankind but to provide that they may be seen hereafter with less hazard to teach the means of avoiding the snares which are laid by TREACHERY for INNOCENCE without infusing any wish for that superiority with which  the betrayer flatters his vanity to give the power of counteracting fraud without the temptation to practise it to initiate youth by mock encounters in the art of necessary defence and to increase prudence without impairing virtue  MANY writers for the sake of following nature so mingle good and bad qualities in their principal personages that they are both equally conspicuous and as we accompany them through their adventures with delight and are led by degrees to interest ourselves in their favour we lose the abhorrence of their faults because they do not hinder our pleasure or perhaps regard them with some kindness for being united with so much merit  THERE have been men indeed splendidly wicked whose endowments throw a brightness on their crimes and whom scarce any villainy made perfectly detestable because they never could be wholly divested of their excellencies but such have been in all ages the great corrupters of the world and their resemblance ought no more to be preserved than the art of murdering without pain  SOME have advanced without due attention to the consequences of this notion that certain virtues have their correspondent faults and therefore that to exhibit either apart is to deviate from probability Thus men are observed by Swift to be grateful in the same degree as they are resentful This principle with others of the same kind supposes man to act from a brute impulse and persue a certain degree of inclination without any choice of the object for otherwise though it should be allowed that gratitude and resentment arise from the same constitution of the passions it follows not that they will be equally indulged when reason is consulted yet unless that consequence be admitted this sagacious maxim becomes an empty sound without any relation to practice or to life  NOR is it evident that even the first motions to these effects are always in the same proportion For pride which produces quickness of resentment will frequently obstruct gratitude by unwillingness to admit that inferiority which obligation necessarily implies and it is surely very unlikely that he who cannot think he receives a favour will ever acknowledge it  IT is of the utmost importance to mankind that positions of this tendency should be laid open and confuted for while men consider good and evil as springing from the same root they will spare the one for the sake of the other and in judging if not of others at least of themselves will be apt to estimate their virtues by their vices To this fatal error all those will contribute who confound the colours of right and wrong and instead of helping to settle their boundaries mix them with so much art that no common mind is able to disunite them  IN narratives where historical veracity has no place I cannot discover why there should not be exhibited the most perfect idea of virtue of virtue not angelical nor above probability for what we cannot credit we shall never imitate but of the highest and purest kind that humanity can reach which when exercised in such trials as the various revolutions of things shall bring upon it may by conquering some calamites and enduring others teach us what we may hope and what we can perform Vice for vice is necessary to be shewn should always disgust nor should the graces of gaiety or the dignity of courage be so united  with it as to reconcile it to the mind Whereever it appears it should raise hatred by the malignity of its practices and contempt by the meanness of its stratagems for while it is supported by either parts or spirit it will be seldom heartily abhorred The Roman tyrant was content to be hated if he was but feared and there are thousands of the readers of romances willing to be thought wicked if they may be allowed to be wits It is therefore to be steadily inculcated that virtue is the highest proof of a superior understanding and the only solid basis of greatness and that vice is the natural consequence of narrow thoughts that it begins in mistake and ends in ignominy  NUMB  TUESDAY  April    Et nunc omnis ager nunc omnis parturit arbos  Nunc frondent silvae nunc formosissimus annus  VIRG  EVERY man is sufficiently discontented with some circumstances of his present state to suffer his imagination to range more or less in quest of future happiness and to fix upon some point of time in which he shall by  the removal of the inconvenience which now perplexes him or the acquisition of advantage which he at present wants find the condition of his life very much improved  WHEN this time which is too often expected with great impatience at last arrives it generally comes without the blessing for which it was desired but we solace ourselves with some new prospect and press forward again with equal eagerness  IT is some advantage to a man in whom this temper prevails in any great degree when he turns his hopes upon things wholly out of his own power since he forbears then to precipitate his affairs for the sake of the great event that is to complete his felicity and waits for the blissful hour without neglecting such measures as are necessary to be taken in the mean time  I HAVE long known a person of this temper who indulged his dream of happiness with less hurt to himself than such chimerical wishes commonly produce and adjusted his scheme with such address that his hopes were in full bloom three parts of the year and in  the other part never wholly blasted Many perhaps would be desirous of learning by what means he procured to himself such a cheap and lasting satisfaction It was gained only by a constant practice of referring the removal of all his uneasiness to the coming of the next spring If his affairs were disordered he could regulate them in the spring if a regimen was prescribed him the spring was the proper time of persuing it if what he wanted was at a high price it would fall its value in the spring  THE spring indeed did often come without any of these effects but he was always certain that the next would be more propitious and was never convinced that the present spring would fail him until the middle of summer for he always talked of the spring as coming 'till it was past and when it was once past every one agreed with him that it was coming  BY long converse with this man I am perhaps in some degree brought to feel the same immoderate pleasure in the contemplation of this delightful season but I have the satisfaction of finding many whom it can be no shame to resemble infected with the same enthusiasm  for there is I believe scarce any poet of eminence who has not left some testimony of his fondness for the flowers the zephyrs and the warblers of the spring Nor has the most luxuriant imagination been able to describe the serenity and happiness of the golden age otherwise than by giving a perpetual spring as the highest reward of uncorrupted innocence  THERE is indeed something inexpressibly pleasing in the annual renovation of the world and the new display of the treasures of nature The cold and darkness of winter with the naked deformity of every object on which we turn our eyes makes us necessarily rejoice at the succeeding season as well for what we have escaped as for what we may enjoy and every budding flower which a warm situation brings early to our view is considered by us as a messenger to inform us of the approach of more joyous days  THE SPRING affords to a mind so free from the disturbance of cares or passions as to be vacant to calm amusements almost every thing that our present state makes us capable of enjoying The variegated verdure of the  fields and woods the succession of grateful odours the voice of pleasure pouring out its notes on every side with the observation of the gladness apparently conceived by every animal from the growth of his food and the clemency of the weather throw over the whole earth an air of gaiety which is very significantly expressed by the smile of nature  THERE are men to whom these scenes are able to give no delight and who hurry away from all the varieties of rural beauty to lose their hours and divert their thoughts by cards or assemblies a tavern dinner or the prattle of the day  IT may be laid down as a position which will seldom deceive that when a man cannot bear his own company there is something wrong He must fly from himself either because he feels a tediousness in life from the equipoise of an empty mind which having no tendency to one motion more than another but as it is impelled by some external power must always have recourse to foreign objects or he must be afraid of the intrusion of some unpleasing ideas and perhaps is always struggling to escape from the remembrance of  a loss the fear of a calamity or some other thought of greater horror  THOSE who are incapacitated to enjoy the pleasures of contemplation by their griefs may very properly apply to such diversions provided they are in  as lay strong hold on the attention and those whom fear of any  down to misery must endeavour to obviate the danger  MY considerations shall on this occasion be  such  are burthensome to themselves merely because they want subjects for reflection and to whom the volume of nature is thrown open without affording them pleasure or instruction because they never learned to read the characters  A FRENCH author has advanced this seeming paradox that  very few men know how to take a walk  and indeed it is very true that few men know how to take a walk with a prospect of any other pleasure than the same company would have afforded them in any other circumstances  THERE are animals that borrow their colour  from the neighbouring body and consequently vary their hue as they happen to change their place In like manner it ought to be the endeavour of every man to derive his reflections from the objects about him for it is to no purpose that he alters his position if his attention continues fixed to the same point The mind should be kept open to the access of every new idea and so far disengaged from the predominance of particular thoughts as to be able to accommodate itself to emergent occasions and remark every thing that offers itself to present examination  A MAN that has formed this habit of turning every new object to his entertainment finds in the productions of nature an inexhaustible stock of materials upon which he can employ himself without any temptations to envy or malevolence faults perhaps seldom totally avoided by those whose judgment is much exercised upon the works of art He has always a certain prospect of discovering new reasons for adoring the sovereign author of the universe and probable hopes of making some discovery of benefit to others or of profit to himself There is no doubt but many vegetables and animals have qualities  that might be of great use to the knowledge of which there is not required much sagacity of penetration or fatigue of study but only frequent experiments and close attention What is said by the chymists of their darling mercury is perhaps true of every body through the whole creation that if a thousand lives should be spent upon it all its properties would not be found out  MANKIND must necessarily be diversified by various tastes since life affords and requires such multiplicity of employments and a nation of naturalists is therefore neither to be hoped or desired but it is surely not improper to point out a fresh amusement to those who languish in health and repine in plenty for want of some source of diversion that may be less easily exhausted and to inform the multitudes of both sexes who are burthened with every new day that there are many shows which they have not seen  HE that enlarges his curiosity after the works of nature demonstrably multiplies the inlets to happiness and therefore the younger part of my readers to whom I dedicate this vernal speculation must excuse me for calling  upon them to make use at once of the spring of the year and the spring of life to acquire while their minds may be yet impressed with new images a love of innocent pleasures and an ardour for useful knowledge and to remember that a blighted spring makes a barren year and that the vernal flowers however beautiful and gay are only intended by nature as preparatives to autumnal fruits  NUMB  SATURDAY  April    Strenua nos exercet inertia navibus atque  Quadrigis petimus bene vivere quod petis hic est  Est Ulubris animus si te non deficit aequus  HOR  THAT man should never suffer his happiness to depend upon external circumstances is one of the chief precepts of the Stoical philosophy a precept indeed which that lofty sect has extended beyond the condition of human life and in which some of them seem to have comprised an utter exclusion of all corporeal pain and pleasure from the regard or attention of a wise man  SUCH  sapientia insaniens  as Horace calls the doctrine of another sect such extravagance of philosophy can want neither authority nor argument for its confutation the experience of every hour is sufficient to overthrow it and the powers of nature rise up against it But we may very properly inquire how near to this exalted state it is in our power to approach how far we can exempt ourselves from outward influences and secure to our minds a state of tranquillity For as the boast of absolute independence is ridiculuos and vain so a mean flexibilty to every impulse and a patient submission to the tyranny of every casual trouble is below the dignity of that mind which however depraved or weakened boasts its derivation from a celestial original and hopes for an union with infinite goodness and unvariable felicity  Ni vitiis pejora fovens  Proprium deserat ortum  THE necessity of erecting ourselves to some degree of intellectual dignity and of preserving  ome resource of pleasure which may not be wholly at the mercy of accident is never more apparent than when we turn our eyes upon  those whom fortune has let loose to their own conduct who not being chained down by their condition to a regular and stated allotment of their hours are obliged to find themselves business or diversion and having nothing within that can either entertain or employ them are compelled to try all the arts of destroying time  THE numberless expedients practised by this class of mortals to alleviate the burthen of life is not less shameful nor perhaps much less pitiable than those to which a trader on the edge of bankruptcy is reduced I have seen melancholy overspread a whole family at the disappointment of a party for cards and after the proposal of a thousand different schemes to supply the loss and the dispatch of the footmen upon a hundred messages they have submitted with a gloomy resignation to the inevitable misfortune of passing one evening in conversation with each other But on a sudden such are the revolutions of the world an unexpected visiter has brought them relief acceptable as provision to a starving city and enabled them to hold out till the next day  THE general remedy of those who are uneasy  without knowing the cause is a change of place they are always willing to imagine that their pain is the consequence of some local inconvenience and endeavour to fly from it as children from their shadows always hoping for more satisfactory delight from every new scene of diversion and always returning home with disappointment and complaints  I CANNOT look upon this kind of infatuation without reflecting on those that suffer under the dreadful symptom of canine madness termed by physicians the hydrophobia or  dread of water  These miserable wretches when they are unable to drink though burning with thirst are sometimes known to try various contortions or inclinations of the body flattering themselves that they can swallow in one posture that liquor which they find in another to repel their lips  YET such folly is not peculiar to the thoughtless or the ignorant but sometimes seizes those minds which seem most exempted from it by the variety of their attainments the quickness of their penetration or the severity of their judgment and indeed the pride of wit and knowledge is often mortified  by finding that they can confer no security against the common errors which mislead the weakest and meanest of mankind  THESE reflexions arose in my mind upon the remembrance of a passage in Cowley's preface to his poems where however exalted by his genius and enlarged by his acquisitions he informs us of a scheme of happiness to which the imagination of a girl upon the loss of her first lover would have scarcely given way but which he seems to have indulged till he had totally forgotten its absurdity and would have probably put in execution had he been hindered only by his reason  'MY desire' say she 'has been for some years past though the execution has been accidentally diverted and does still vehemently continue to retire myself to some of our American plantations not to seek for gold or enrich myself with the traffic of those parts which is the end of most men that travel thither but to forsake this world for ever with all the vanities and vexations of it and to bury my self there in some obscure retreat but not without the consolation of letters and philosophy'  SUCH was the chimerical provision which Cowley had made in his own mind for the quiet of his remaining life and which he seems to recomend to posterity since there is no other reason for his disclosing it Surely no stronger instance can be given of a persuasion that content was the inhabitant of particular regions and that a man might set sail with a fair wind and leave behind him all his cares incumbrances and calamities  IF he travelled so far with no other purpose than to  bury himself in some obscure retreat  he might have found in his own country innumerable coverts sufficiently obscure to have concealed the genius of Cowley for whatever might be his own opinion of the importunity with which he should be summoned back into public life a short experience would have convinced him that privation is much easier than acquisition and that it would require very little policy to free himself from the intrusion of the world There is pride enough in the human heart to prevent much desire of acquaintance with a man by whom we are sure to be treated with neglect however his reputation for science or virtue may excite  our curiosity or esteem so that the lover of retirement need not be much afraid lest the respect of strangers should overwhelm him with visits and those to whom he has formerly been known will very patiently support his absence when they have tryed a little to live without him and found new diversions for those moments which his company contributed to exhilarate or relax  IT was perhaps ordained by providence to hinder us from tyrannising over one another that no individual should be of so much importance as to cause by his retreat or death any chasm in the world And Cowley had conversed to little purpose with mankind if he had not remarked how soon the useful friend the gay companion and the favoured lover when once they are removed from before the fight give way to the succession of new objects  THE privacy therefore of his hermitage might have been safe enough from violation though he had chosen it within the limits of his native island and he might have found here preservatives against the  vanities  and  vexations  of the world not less efficacious than  those which the woods or fields of America could afford him but having once his mind imbittered with disgust he conceived it impossible to be far enough from the cause of his uneasiness he was posting away with all the expedition of a coward who for want of venturing to look behind him thinks the enemy perpetually at his heels  WHEN he was interrupted by company or fatigued with business he so strongly imaged to himself the happiness of leisure and retreat that he determined to enjoy them for the future without interuption and to exclude for ever all that could deprive him of his darling satisfactions He forgot in the vehemence of his desire that solitude and quiet owe their pleasures to those miseries which he was so studious to obviate for such are the vicissitudes of the world through all its parts that day and night labour and rest converse and retirement endear each other such are the changes that keep the mind in action we desire we persue we obtain we are satiated we desire something else and begin a new persuit  IF he had proceeded in his project and sixt his habitation in the most delightful part  of the new world it may be much doubted whether his distance from the  vanities  of life would have enabled him to have kept away the  vexations  It is common for a man who feels pain to fancy that he could bear it better in any other part Cowley having known the troubles and perplexities of a particular condition very readily persuaded himself that nothing worse was to be found and that every alteration would bring some improvement he never suspected that the cause of his unhappiness was in himself that his own passions were not sufficiently regulated and that he was harrassed by his own impatience which as it could never be without something to awaken it would torment him in any other country accompany him over the sea and find its way to his American elysium He would upon the tryal have been soon convinced that the fountain of content must spring up in the mind and that he who has so little knowledge of human nature as to seek happiness by changing any thing but his own dispositions will waste his life in fruitless efforts and multiply the griefs which he purposes to remove  NUMB  TUESDAY  April    O qui perpetuâ mundum ratione gubernas  Terrarum coelique saton  Disjice terrenae nebulas pondera molis  Atque tuo splendore mica Tu namque serenum  Tu requies tranquilla piis Te cernere finis  Principium vector dux semita terminus idem  BOETHIUS  THE love of RETIREMENT has in all ages adhered very closely to those minds which have been most enlarged by knowledge or elevated by genius Those who have enjoyed every thing that is generally supposed to confer happiness have been forced to seek it in the shades of privacy Though they have possessed both power and riches and been therefore surrounded by men who considered it as their chief interest to remove from them every thing that might offend their ease ruffle their tranquillity or interrupt their pleasure they have soon felt the languors of satiety and found themselves unable to pursue the race of life except with frequent respirations of intermediate solitude  TO produce this disposition nothing appears requisite but a quick sensibility and active imagination for without being devoted to the persuit of virtue or the study of science a man whose faculties enable him to make ready comparisons of the present with the past will find such a constant recurrence of the same pleasures the same troubles the same expectations and the same disappointments that he will gladly snatch an hour of retreat to let his thoughts expatiate at large and seek for that variety in his own ideas which the objects of sense cannot afford him  NOR will greatness or abundance contribute to exempt him from the importunities of this desire since if he is born to think he cannot restrain himself from a thousand inquiries and speculations which he must persue by his own reason and which the splendour of his condition can only hinder for those who are most exalted above dependance or controul are yet condemned to pay so large a tribute of their time to custom ceremony and popularity that according to the  Greek  proverb no man in the house is more a slave than the master  WHEN a king asked Euclid the mathematician whether he could not explain his art to him in a more compendious manner he was answered that there was no royal way to geometry Other things may be seized by might or purchased with money but knowledge is to be gained only by study and study to be prosecuted only in retirement  THESE are some of the motives which have had power to sequester kings and heroes from the crouds that soothed them with flatteries or inspirited them with acclamations but their efficacy seems confined to superior abilities and to operate little upon the common classes of mankind to whose conceptions the present assemblage of things is adequate and who seldom range beyond those entertainments and vexations which solicit their attention by pressing on their senses  BUT there is an universal reason for some stated intervals of solitude which the institutions of the church call upon me now especially to mention a reason which extends as wide as moral duty or the hopes of divine favour in a future state and which ought to  influence all ranks of life and all degrees of intellect since none can imagine themselves not comprehended in its obligation but such as determine to set their maker at defiance by obstinate wickedness or whose enthusiastick security of his approbation places them above external ordinances and all human means of improvement  THE great task of the man who conducts his life by the precepts of religion is to make the future predominant over the present to impress upon his mind so strong a sense of the importance of obedience to the divine will of the value of the reward promised to virtue and the terrors of the punishment denounced against crimes as may overbear all the temptations which temporal hope or fear can bring in his way and enable him to bid equal defiance to joy and sorrow to turn away at one time from the allurements of ambition and push forward at another against the threats of calamity  IT is not without reason that the apostle represents our passage through this stage of our existence by images drawn from the alarms and solicitude of a military life for we are  placed in such a state that almost every thing about us conspires against our chief interest We are in danger from whatever can get possession of our thoughts all that can excite in us either pain or pleasure has a tendency to obstruct the way that leads to happiness and either to turn us aside or retard our progress  OUR senses our appetites and our passions are our lawful and faithful guides in most things that relate solely to this life and therefore by the hourly necessity of consulting them we gradually sink into an implicit submission and habitual confidence Every act of compliance with their motions facilitates a second compliance every new step towards depravity is made with less reluctance than the former and thus the descent to life merely sensual is perpetually accelerated  THE senses have not only that advantage over conscience which things necessary must always have over things chosen but they have likewise a kind of prescription in their favour We feared pain much earlier than we apprehended guilt and were delighted with the sensations of pleasure before we had capacities  to be charmed with the beauty of rectitude To this power thus early established and incessantly increasing it must be remembered that almost every man has in some part of his life added new strength by a voluntary or negligent subjection of himself for who is there that has not instigated his appetites by indulgence or suffered them by an unresisting neutrality to enlarge their dominion and multiply their demands  FROM the necessity of dispossessing the sensual faculties of the influence which they must naturally gain by this preoccupation of the soul arises that conflict between opposite desires in the first endeavours after a religious life which however enthusiastically it may have been described however contemptuously ridiculed will naturally be felt in some degree though varied without end by different tempers of mind and innumerable circumstances of health or condition greater or less fervour more or fewer temptations to relapse  FROM the perpetual necessity of consulting the animal faculties in our provision for the present life arises the difficulty of withstanding their impulses even in cases where they  ought to be of no weight for the motions of sense are instantaneous its objects strike unsought we are accustomed to follow its directions and therefore often submit to the sentence without examining the authority of the judge  THUS it appears upon a philosophical estimate that supposing the mind at any certain time in an equipoise between the pleasures of this life and the hopes of futurity present objects falling more frequently into the scale would in time preponderate and that our regard for an invisible state would grow every moment weaker till at last it would lose all its activity and become absolutely without effect  TO prevent this dreadful event the balance is put into our own hands and we have power to transfer the weight to either side The motives to a life of holiness are infinite not less than the favour or anger of omnipotence not less than eternity of happiness or misery But these can only influence our conduct as they gain our attention which the business or diversions of the world are always calling off by contrary attractions  THE great art therefore of piety and the end for which all the rites of religion seem to be instituted is the perpetual renovation of the motives to virtue by a voluntary employment of our mind in the contemplation of its excellence its importance and its necessity which in proportion as they are more frequently and more willingly revolved gain a more forcible and permanent influence 'till in time they become the reigning ideas the standing principles of action and the test by which everything proposed to the judgment is rejected or approved  TO facilitate this change of our affections it is necessary that we weaken the temptations of the world by retiring at certain seasons from it for its influence arising only from its presence is much lessened when it becomes the object of solitary meditation A constant residence amidst noise and pleasure inevitably obliterates the impressions of piety and a frequent abstraction of ourselves into a state where this life like the next operates only upon the reason will reinstate religion in its just authority even without those irradiations from above the hope of which I have yet no  no intention to withdraw from the sincere and the diligent  THIS is that conquest of the world and of ourselves which has been always considered as the perfection of human nature and this is only to be obtained by fervent prayer steady resolutions and frequent retirement from folly and vanity from the cares of avarice and the joys of intemperance from the lulling sounds of deceitful flattery and the tempting sight of prosperous wickedness  NUMB  SATURDAY  April    Patitur poenas peccandi sola voluntas  Nam scelus intra se tacitum qui cogitat ullum  Facti crimen habet  JUV  IF the most active and industrious of mankind was able at the close of life to recollect distinctly his past moments and distribute them in a regular account according to the manner in which they have been spent it is scarcely to be imagined how few would be marked out to the mind by any permanent or visible effects how small a proportion his  real action would bear to his seeming possibilities of action how many chasms he would find of perfect vacuity and how many interstitial spaces unfilled even in the most tumultuous hurries of business and the most eager vehemence of persuit  IT is observed by modern philosophers that not only the great globes of matter are thinly scattered through the universe but the hardest bodies are so porous that if all matter were compressed to perfect solidity it might be contained in a cube of a few feet In like manner if all the employments of life were crowded into the time which it really occupied perhaps a few weeks days or hours would be sufficient for its accomplishment so far as the mind was engaged in the performance For such is the inequality of our corporeal to our intellectual faculties that we contrive in minutes what we execute in years and the soul often stands an idle spectator of the labour of the hands and expedition of the feet  FOR this reason the antient generals often found themselves at leisure to persue the study of philosophy in the camp and Lucan with  historical veracity makes Caesar relate of himself that his wars never hindered celestial observations and that he noted the revolutions of the stars in the midst of preparations for battle  Media inter praelia semper  Sideribus caelique plagis superisque vacavi  THAT the soul always exerts her peculiar powers with greater or less force is very probable though the common occasions of our present condition require but a small part of that incessant cogitation and by the natural frame of our bodies and general combination of the world we are unavoidably condemned to so frequent inactivity that as through all our time we are thinking for a great part of our time we can only think  LEST so restless a power should be either unprofitably or hurtfully employed and the superfluities of intellect run to waste it is no vain speculation to consider how we may govern our thoughts restrain them from irregular motions or confine them from boundless dissipation  HOW the understanding is best conducted to  the knowledge of science by what steps it is to be led forwards in its persuit how it is to be cured of its defects and habituated to new studies has been the inquiry of many acute and learned men whose observations I shall not on this occasion either adopt or censure my purpose being to consider the moral discipline of the mind and to promote the increase of virtue rather than of learning  THIS inquiry seems to have been neglected for want of remembering that all action has its origin in the mind and that therefore to suffer the thoughts to be vitiated is to poison the fountains of morality Irregular desires will produce licentious practices what men allow themselves to wish they will soon believe and will be at last incited to execute what they please themselves with contriving  FOR this reason the casuists of the  Romish  church who gain by confession great opportunities of knowing human nature have I think generally determined that what it is a crime to do it is a crime to think Since by revolving with pleasure the facility safety or advantage of a wicked deed a man soon begins to find his constancy relax and his detestation  soften the happiness of success is glittering before him withdraws his attention from the atrociousness of the guilt and actsare at last confidently perpetrated of which the first conception only crept into the mind disguised in pleasing complications and permitted rather than invited  NO man has ever been drawn to crimes by love or jealousy envy or hatred but he can tell how easily he might at first have repelled the temptation how readily his mind would have obeyed a call to any other object and how weak his passion has been after some casual avocation 'till he has recalled it again to his heart and revived the viper by too warm a fondness  SUCH therefore is the importance of keeping our reason a constant guard over our imagination that we have otherwise no security for our own virtue but may corrupt our hearts in the most recluse solitude with more pernicious and tyrannical appetites and wishes than the commerce of the world will generally produce for we are easily shocked by crimes which appear at once in their full magnitude but the gradual growth of our own wickedness  endeared by interest and palliated by all the artifices of selfdeceit gives us time to form distinctions in our own favour and reason by degrees submits to absurdity as the eye is accommodated to darkness  IN this disease of the soul it is of the utmost importance to apply remedies at the beginning and therefore I shall endeavour to shew what thoughts are to be rejected or improved as they regard the past present or future in hopes that some may be awakened to caution and vigilance who perhaps indulge themselves in dangerous dreams so much the more dangerous because being yet only dreams they are concluded innocent  THE recollection of the past is only useful by way of provision for the future and thererfore in reviewing all the occurrences that fall under a religious consideration it is proper that a man stop at the first thoughts to remark how he was led thither and why he continues the reflection If he is dwelling with delight upon a stratagem of successful fraud a night of licentious riot or an intrigue of guilty pleasure let him summon off his imagination as from an unlawful persuit expel those  passages from his remembrance of which though he cannot seriously approve them the pleasure overpowers the guilt and refer them to a future hour when they may be considered with greater safety Such an hour will certainly come for the impressions of past pleasure are always lessening but the sense of guilt which respects futurity continues the same  THE serious and impartial retrospect of our conduct is indisputably necessary to the confirmation or recovery of virtue and is therefore recommended under the name of selfexamination by divines as the first act previous to repentance It is indeed of so great use that without it we should always be to begin life be seduced for ever by the same allurements and misled by the same fallacies But in order that we may not lose the advantage of our experience we must endeavour to see every thing in its proper form and excite in ourselves those sentiments which the great author of nature has decreed the concomitants or followers of good or bad actions  Let not sleep  says Pythagoras  fall upon thy eyes till thou hast thrice reviewed the transactions of the past day Where have I turned aside from rectitude What have I been doing What have I left undone which I ought to have done Begin thus from the first act and proceed and in conclusion at the ill which thou hast done be troubled and rejoice for the good  OUR thoughts on present things being determined by the objects before us fall not under those indulgences or excursions which I am now considering But I cannot forbear under this head to caution pious and tender minds that are disturbed by the irruptions of wicked imaginations against too great dejection and too anxious alarms for thoughts are only criminal when they are first chosen and then voluntarily continued  Evil into the mind of god or man  May come and go so unapprov'd and leave  No spot or stain behind  MILTON  IN futurity chiefly are the snares lodged by which the imagination is intangled Futurity is the proper abode of hope and fear with all their train and progeny of subordinate apprehensions and desires In futurity events and  chances are yet floating at large without apparent connexion with their causes and we therefore easily indulge the liberty of gratifying ourselves with a pleasing choice To pick and cull among possible advantages is as the civil law terms it  in vacuum venire  to take what belongs to nobody but it has this hazard in it that we shall be unwilling to quit what we have seized though an owner should be found It is easy to think on that which may be gained till at last we resolve to gain it and to imagine the happiness of particular conditions till we can be easy in no other We ought at least to let our desires fix upon nothing in another's power for the sake of our quiet or in another's possession for the sake of our innocence When a man finds himself led though by a train of honest sentiments to a wish for that to which he has no right he should start back as from a pitfal covered with flowers He that fancies he should benefit the publick more in a great station than the man that fills it will in time imagine it an act of virtue to supplant him and as opposition readily kindles into hatred his eagerness to do that good to which he is not called will betray him to crimes which in his original scheme were never purposed  HE therefore that would govern his actions by the laws of virtue must regulate his thoughts by those of reason he must keep guilt from the recesses of his heart and remember that the pleasures of fancy and the emotions of desire are more dangerous as they are more hidden since they escape the awe of observation and operate equally in every situation without the concurrence of external opportunities  NUMB  TUESDAY  April    Quod sis esse velis nihilque malis  MART  IT is justly remarked by Horace that howsoever every man may complain occasionally of the hardships of his condition he is seldom willing to change it for any other on the same level for whether it be that he who follows an employment made choice of it at first on account of its suitableness to his inclination or that when accident or the determination of others have placed him in a particular station he by endeavouring to reconcile himself to it gets the custom of viewing  it only on the fairest side or whether every man thinks that class to which he belongs the most illustrious merely because he has honoured it with his name it is certain that whatever be the reason most men have a very strong and active prejudice in favour of their own vocation always working upon their minds and influencing their behaviour  THIS partiality is sufficiently visible in every rank of the human species but it exerts itself more frequently and with greater force among those who have never learned to conceal their sentiments for reasons of policy or to model their expressions by the laws of politeness and therefore the chief contests of wit among artificers and handicraftsmen arise from a mutual endeavour to exalt one trade by depreciating another  FROM the same principle are derived many consolations to alleviate the inconveniences to which every calling is peculiarly exposed A blacksmith was lately pleasing himself at his anvil with observing that though his trade was hot and sooty laborious and unhealthy yet he had the honour of living by his hammer he got his bread like a man and if his son  should rise in the world and keep his coach no body could reproach him that his father was a taylor  A MAN truly zealous for his fraternity is never so irresistibly flattered as when some rival calling is mentioned with contempt Upon this principle a linendraper boasted that he had got a new customer whom he could safely trust for he could have no doubt of his honesty since it was known from unquestionable authority that he was now filing a bill in chancery to delay payment for the cloaths which he had worn the last seven years and he himself had heard him declare in a publick coffeehouse that he looked upon the whole generation of woollendrapers to be such despicable wretches that no gentleman ought to pay them till the demand was doubled by law charges  IT has been observed that physicians and lawyers are no friends to religion and many conjectures have been formed to discover the reason of such a combination between men who agree in nothing else and who seem less to be affected in their own provinces by religious opinions than any other part of the  community The truth is very few of them have thought about religion but they have all seen a parson seen him in a habit different from their own and therefore declared war against him A young student from the inns of court who has often attacked the curate of his father's parish with such arguments as his acquaintances could furnish and returned to town without success is now gone down with a resolution to destroy him for he has learned at last how to manage a prig and if he pretends to hold him again to syllogism he has a catch in reserve which neither logic nor metaphysics can resist  I laugh to think how your unshaken  Cato  Will look aghast when unforeseen destruction  Pours in upon him thus  THE malignity of soldiers and sailors against each other has been often experienced at the cost of their country and perhaps no orders of men have an enmity of more acrimony or longer continuance When upon our late successes at sea some new regulations were concerted for establishing the rank of the naval commanders a captain of foot very acutely remarked that nothing was more absurd than to give any honorary rewards to seamen "for  honour says he ought only to be won by bravery and all the world knows that there is no danger and therefore no evidence of courage in a fight at sea"  BUT as this general desire of aggrandizing themselves by raising their profession betrays men to a thousand ridiculous and mischievous acts of supplantation and detraction so as almost all passions have their good as well as bad effects it likewise excites ingenuity and sometimes raises an honest and useful emulation of diligence It may be observed in general that no trade had ever reached the excellence to which it is now improved had its professors looked upon it with the eyes of indifferent spectators the advances from the first rude essays must have been made by men who valued themselves for performances for which scarce any other would be persuaded to esteem them  IT is pleasing to contemplate a manufacture rising gradually from its first mean state by the successive labours of innumerable minds to consider the first hollow trunk of an oak in which perhaps the shepherd could scarce venture to cross a brook swelled with a  shower enlarged at last into a ship of war attacking fortresses terrifying nations setting storms and billows at defiance and visiting the remotest parts of the globe And it might contribute to dispose us to a kinder regard for the labours of one another if we were to consider from what unpromising beginnings the most useful productions of art have probably arisen Who when he saw the first sand or ashes by a casual intenseness of heat melted into a metalline form rugged with excrescences and clouded with impurities would have imagined that in this shapeless lump lay concealed so many conveniencies of life as would in time constitute a great part of the happiness of the world Yet by some such fortuitous liquefaction was mankind taught to procure a body at once in a high degree solid and transparent which might admit the light of the sun and exclude the violence of the wind which might extend the sight of the philosopher to new ranges of existence and charm him at one time with the unbounded extent of the material creation and at another with the endless subordination of animal life and what is yet of more importance might supply the decays of nature and succour old age with subsidiary sight Thus was the first  artificer in glass employed though without his own knowledge or expectation He was facilitating and prolonging the enjoyment of light enlarging the avenues of science and conferring the highest and most lasting pleasures he was enabling the student to contemplate nature and the beauty to behold herself  This passion for the honour of a profession like that for the grandeur of our own country is to be regulated not extinguished Every man from the highest to the lowest station ought to warm his heart and animate his endeavours with the hopes of being useful to the world by advancing the art which it is his lot to exercise and for that end he must necessarily consider the whole extent of its application and the whole weight of its importance But let him not too readily imagine that another is ill employed because for want of fuller knowledge of his business he is not able to comprehend its dignity Every man ought to endeavour at eminence not by pulling others down but by raising himself and enjoy the pleasure of his own superiority whether imaginary or real without interrupting others in the same felicity The philosopher may  very justly be delighted with the extent of his views and the artificer with the readiness of his hands but let the one remember that without mechanical performances refined speculation is an empty dream and the other that without theoretical reasoning dexterity is little more than a brute instinct  NUMB  SATURDAY  April    Posthabui tamen illorum mea seria ludo  VIRG  THE number of correspondents which encreases every day upon me shows that my paper is at least distinguished from the common productions of the press It is no less a proof of eminence to have many enemies than many friends and I look upon every letter whether it contains encomiums or reproaches as an equal attestation of rising credit The only pain which I can feel from my correspondence is the fear of disgusting those whose letters I shall seem to neglect and therefore I take this opportunity of reminding them that in disapproving their attempts whenever it may happen I only return the  treatment which I often receive Besides many particular motives influence a writer known only to himself or his private friends and it may be justly concluded that not all letters which are postponed are rejected nor all that are rejected critically condemned  HAVING thus eased my heart of the only apprehension that sat heavy on it I can please myself with the candour of Benevolus who encourages me to proceed without sinking under the anger of Flirtilla who quarrels with me for being old and ugly and for wanting both activity of body and sprightliness of mind feeds her monkey with my lucubrations and refuses any mitigation till I have appeared in vindication of masquerades That she may not however imagine me without support and left to rest wholly upon my own fortitude I shall now publish some letters which I have received from men as well dressed and as handsome as her favorite and others from ladies whom I sincerely believe as young as rich as gay as pretty as fashionable and as often toasted and treated as herself  A SET of candid readers send their respects to the Rambler and acknowledge  his merit in so well beginning a work that may be of publick benefit But superior as his genius is to the impertinences of a trifling age they cannot help a wish that he would condescend to the weakness of minds softened by perpetual amusements and now and then throw in like his predecessor some papers of a gay and humorous turn Too fair a field now lies open with too plentiful a harvest of follies let the chearful Thalia put in her sickle and singing at her work deck her hair with red and blue  A LADY sends her compliments to the Rambler and desires to know by what other name she may direct to him what are his set of friends his amusements what his way of thinking with regard to the living world and its ways in short whether he is a person now alive and in town If he be she will do herself the honour to write to him pretty often and hopes from time to time to be the better for his advice and animadversions for his animadversions on her neighbours at least But if he is a mere essayist and troubles not himself with the manners of the age she  is sorry to tell him that even the genius and correctness of an Addison will not secure him from neglect  NO man is so much abstracted from common life as not to feel a particular pleasure from the regard of the female world the candid writers of the first billet will not be offended that my haste to satisfy a lady has hurried their address too soon out of my mind and that I refer them for a reply to some future paper in order to tell this curious inquirer after my other name the answer of a philosopher to a man who meeting him in the street desired to see what he carried under his cloak  I carry it there  says he  that you may not see it  But though she is never to know my name she may often see my face for I am of her opinion that a diurnal writer ought to view the world and that he who neglects his contemporaries may be with justice neglected by them  LADY Racket sends compliments to the Rambler and lets him know she shall have cards at her house every Sunday the remainder of the season where he will be sure of meeting all the good company in town By this means she hopes to see his papers  interspersed with living characters She longs to see the torch of truth produced at an assembly and to admire the charming lustre it will throw on the jewels complexions and behaviour of every dear creature there  IT is a rule with me to receive every offer with the same civility as it is made and therefore though lady Racket may have had some reason to guess that I seldom frequent cardtables on Sundays I shall not insist upon an exception which may to her appear of so little force My business has been to view as opportunity was offered every place in which mankind was to be seen but at cardtables however brilliant I have always thought my visit lost for I could know nothing of the company but their cloaths and their faces I saw their looks clouded at the beginning of every game with an uniform solicitude now and then in its progress varied with a short triumph at sometimes wrinkled with cunning at others deadened with despondency or by accident flushed with rage at the unskilful or unlucky play of a partner From such assemblies in whatever humour I happened to enter them I was quickly forced to retire  they were too trifling for me when I was grave and too dull when I was chearful  YET I cannot but value myself upon this token of regard from a lady who is not afraid to stand before the torch of truth Let her not however consult her curiosity more than her prudence but reflect a moment on the fate of Semele who might have lived the favorite of Jupiter if she could have been content without his thunder It is dangerous for mortal beauty or terrestrial virtue to be examined by too strong a light The torch of truth shows much that we cannot and all that we would not see In a face dimpled with smiles it has often discovered malevolence and envy and detected under jewels and brocade the frightful forms of poverty and distress A fine hand of cards have changed before it into a thousand spectres of sickness misery and vexation and immense sums of money while the winner counted them with transport have at the first glimpse of this unwelcome lustre vanished from before him If her ladyship therefore designs to continue her assembly I would advise her to shun such dangerous experiments to satisfy herself with common appearances and to light up her apartments  rather with myrtle candles than the torch of truth  A MODEST young man sends his service to the author of the Rambler and will be very willing to assist him in his work but is sadly afraid of being discouraged by having his first essay rejected a disgrace he has wofully experienced in every offer he had made of it to every new writer of every new paper but he comforts himself by thinking without vanity that this has been from a peculiar favour of the muses who saved his performance from being buried in trash and reserved it to appear with lustre in the Rambler  I AM equally a friend to modesty and enterprize and therefore shall think it an honour to correspond with a young man who possesses both in so eminent a degree Youth is indeed the time in which these qualities ought chiefly to be found modesty suits well with inexperience and enterprize with health and vigour and an extensive prospect of life One of my predecessors has justly observed that though modesty has an amiable and winning appearance it ought not to hinder the exertion of  the active powers but that a man should show under his blushes a latent resolution This point of perfection nice as it is my correspondent seems to have attained That he is modest his own declaration may evince and I think the  latent resolution  may be discovered in his letter by an acute observer I will advise him since he so well deserves my precepts not to be discouraged though the Rambler should prove equally envious or tasteless with the rest of this fraternity If his paper is refused the press of England is open let him try the judgment of the publick If as it has some times happened by a general combination against superior merit he cannot persuade the world to buy his works he may present them to his friends and if his friends are seized with the epidemical infatuation and cannot find his genius or will not confess it let him then refer his cause to posterity and reserve his other labours for a wiser age  THUS have I dispatched some of my correspondents in the usual manner with fair words and general civility But to Flirtilla the gay Flirtilla what shall I reply Unable as I am to fly at her command over land and seas or to supply her from week to week  with the fashions of Paris or the intrigues of Madrid I am yet not willing to incur her farther displeasure and would save my papers from her monkey on any reasonable terms By what propitiation therefore may I atone for my former gravity and open without trembling the future letters of this sprightly persecutor To write in defence of masquedes is no easy task yet something difficult and daring may well be required as the price of so important an approbation I therefore consulted in this great emergency a man of high reputation in gay life who having added to his other accomplishments no mean proficiency in the minute philosophy after the fifth perusal of her letter broke out with rapture into these words 'And can you Mr Rambler stand out against this charming creature Let her know at least that from this moment Nigrinus devotes his life and his labours to her service Is there any stubborn prejudice of education that stands between thee and the most amiable of mankind Behold Flirtilla at thy feet a man grown grey in the study of those noble arts by which right and wrong may be confounded by which reason may be blinded when we have a mind to escape  from her inspection and caprice and appetite instated in uncontroulled command and boundless dominion Such a casuist may surely engage with certainty of success in vindication of an entertainment which in an instant gives confidence to the timorous and kindles ardour in the cold and entertainment where the vigilance of jealousy has so often been eluded and the virgin is set free from the necessity of languishing in silence where all the outworks of chastity are at once demolished where the heart is laid open without a blush where bashfulness may survive virtue and no wish is crush'd under the frown of modesty Far weaker influence than Flirtilla's might gain over an advocate for such amusements It was declared by Pompey that if the commonwealth was violated he could stamp with his foot and raise an army out of the ground if the rights of pleasure are again invaded let but Flirtilla crack her fan no pens nor swords shall be wanting at the summons the wit and the colonel shall march out at her command and neither law nor reason shall stand before us'  NUMB  TUESDAY  April    Non Dindymene non adytis quatit  Mentem sacerdotum incola Pythius  Non Liber aeque non acuta  Sic geminant Corybantes aera  Tristes ut irae  HOR  THE maxim which Periander of Corinth one of the seven sages of Greece left as a memorial of his knowledge and benevolence was    Be master of thy anger  He considered anger as the great disturber of human life the chief enemy both of publick happiness and private tranquillity and therefore thought that he could not lay on posterity a stronger obligation to reverence his memory than by leaving them a salutary caution against this outrageous passion  TO what latitude Periander might extend the word the brevity of his precept will scarce allow us to conjecture From anger in its full import protracted into malevolence and exerted in revenge arise indeed many of the  evils to which the life of man is exposed By anger operating upon power are produced the subversion of cities the desolation of countries the massacre of nations and all those dreadful and astonishing calamities which fill the histories of the world and which could not be read at any distant point of time when the passions stand neutral and every motive and principle is lest to its natural force without some doubt of the veracity of the relation did we not see the same causes still tending to the same effects and only acting with less vigour for want of the same concurrent opportunities  BUT this gigantick and enormous species of anger falls not properly under the animadversion of a writer whose chief end is the regulation of common life and whose precepts are to recommend themselves by their general use Nor is this essay intended to expose the tragical or fatal effects even of private malignity The anger which I propose now for my subject is such as makes those who indulge it more troublesome than formidable and ranks them rather with hornets and wasps than with basilisks and lions I have therefore prefixed a motto which characterises  this passion not so much by the mischief that it causes as by the noise that it utters  THERE is in the world a certain class of mortals known and contentedly known by the appellation of  passionate men  who imagine themselves entitled by that distinction to be provoked on every slight occasion and to vent their rage in vehement and fierce vociferations in furious menaces and licentious reproaches Their rage indeed for the most part fumes away in outcries of injury and protestations of vengeance and seldom proceeds to actual violence unless a drawer or linkboy falls in their way but they interrupt the quiet of those that happen to be within the reach of their clamours disturb the course of conversation and interrupt the enjoyment of society  MEN of this kind are sometimes not without understanding or virtue sufficient to recommend them to love and regard and are therefore not always treated with the severity which their neglect of the ease of all about them might justly provoke they have obtained a kind of prescription for their folly and being considered by their companions as  under a predominant influence that leaves them no masters of their conduct or their language as acting without thought and rushing into mischief with a mist before their eyes they are pitied rather than censured and their sallies are passed over as the involuntary blows of a man agitated by the spasms of a convulsion  IT is surely not to be observed without indignation that men are to be found of minds mean enough to be satisfied with this treatment wretches who are proud to obtain the privilege of madmen and can without shame and without regret consider themselves as receiving hourly pardons from their companions and giving them continual opportunities of exercising their patience and boasting their clemency  PRIDE is undoubtedly the original of anger but pride like every other passion if it once breaks loose from reason counteracts its own purposes A passionate man upon the review of his day will have very few gratifications to offer to his pride when he has considered how his outrages were caused why they were  born and in what they are likely to end at last  THOSE sudden bursts of rage generally break out upon small occasions for life unhappy as it is cannot supply great evils as frequently as the man of fire thinks fit to be enraged and therefore the first reflection upon his violence must show him that he is mean enough to be driven from his post by every petty incident that he is the mere slave of trivial chances and that his reason and his virtue are in the power of the wind  ONE motive there is of these loud extravagancies which a man is generally careful to conceal from others and perhaps does not always discover to himself He that finds his knowledge narrow and his arguments weak and by consequence his suffrage not much regarded in questions accurately examined and seriously debated is sometimes in hope of gaining that attention by his clamours which he cannot otherwise obtain and is pleased with remembring that at least he made himself heard that he had the power to interrupt those whom he could not confute and suspend the decision which he could not guide  OF this kind is the fury to which many men give way among their servants and domesticks they feel their own ignorance they see their own insignificance and therefore they endeavour by their fury to fright away contempt from before them when they know it must follow them behind and think themselves eminently masters when they see one folly tamely complied with only for fear lest refusal or delay should provoke them to a greater  THESE temptations cannot but be owned to have some force and it is so little pleasing to any man to see himself wholly overlooked in the mass of things that he may be allowed to try a few expedients for procuring some kind of supplemental dignity and to endeavour to add weight by the violence of his temper to the lightness of his other powers But this has now been long practised and found upon the most exact estimate not to produce advantages equal to its inconveniences for it has not appeared that a man has by uproar and tumult and bluster altered any one's opinion of his understanding or been able to gain any influence except over those  whom fortune or nature have made his dependents He may by a steady perseverance in his ferocity fright his children and harrass his servants but all the rest of the world will look on and laugh and he will have the comfort at last of thinking that he lives only to raise contempt and hatred emotions to which wisdom and virtue would be always unwilling to give occasion He will find that he has contrived only to make those fear him whom every reasonable being is endeavouring to endear by kindness and must content himself with the pleasure of a triumph obtained by trampling on those who could not resist him He must perceive that the apprehension which his presence causes is not the awe of his virtue but the dread of his brutality and that he has given up the felicity of being loved without gaining the honour of being reverenced  BUT this is not the only ill consequence of the frequent indulgence of this blustering passion which a man by often calling to his assistance will teach in a short time to intrude before the summons to rush upon him with resistless violence and without any previous notice of its approach He will find himself liable to be inflamed at the first touch of provocation and  unable to retain his resentment till he has a full conviction of the offence to proportion his anger to the cause or to regulate it by prudence or by duty When a man has once suffered his mind to be thus vitiated he becomes one of the most hateful and unhappy beings He can give no security to himself that he shall not at the next interview alienate by some sudden transport his dearest friend or break out upon some slight contradiction into such terms of rudeness as can never be perfectly forgotten Whoever converses with him lives with the suspicion and solicitude of a man that plays with a tame tiger always under a necessity of watching the moment in which the capricious savage shall begin to growl  IT is told by Prior in a panegyrick on lord Dorset that his servants used to put themselves in his way when he was angry because he was sure to recompense them for any indignities which he made them suffer This is the round of a passionate man's life he contracts debts when he is furious which his virtue if he has virtue obliges him to discharge at the return of reason He spends his time in outrage and acknowledgement injury and  reparation Or if there be any who hardens himself in oppression and justifies the wrong because he has done it his insensibility can make small part of his praise or his happiness he only adds deliberate to hasty folly aggravates petulance by contumacy and destroys the only plea that he can offer for the tenderness and patience of mankind  YET even this degree of depravity we may be content to pity because it seldom wants a punishment equal to its guilt Nothing is more despicable or more miserable than the old age of a passionate man When the vigour of youth fails him and his amusements pall with frequent repetition his occasional rage sinks by decay of strength into peevishness that peevishness for want of novelty and variety becomes habitual the world falls off from around him and he is left as Homer expresses it  to devour his own heart in solitude and contempt  NUMB  SATURDAY  April    Miserum parvâ stipe focilat ut pudibundos  Exercere sales inter convivia possit  Tu mitis acri  Asperitate carens positoque per omnia fastu  Inter ut aequales unus numeraris amicos  Obsequiumque doces amorem quaeris amando  Lucanus ad Pisonem  To the RAMBLER  SIR  AS you seem to have devoted your labours to virtue I cannot forbear to inform you of one species of cruelty with which the life of a man of letters perhaps does not often make him acquainted and which as it seems to produce no other advantage to those that practise it than a short gratification of thoughtless vanity may become less common when it has been once exposed in its various forms and its full magnitude  I AM the daughter of a country gentleman whose family is numerous and whose estate not at first sufficient to supply us with affluence  has been lately so much impaired by an unsuccessful lawsuit that all the younger children are obliged to try such means as their education affords them for procuring the necessaries of life Distress and curiosity concurred to bring me to London where I was received by a relation with the coldness which misfortune generally finds A week a long week I lived with my cousin before the most vigilant enquiry could procure us the least hopes of a place in which time I was much better qualified to bear all the vexations of servitude The first two days she was content to pity me and only wish'd I had not been quite so well bred but people must comply with their circumstances This lenity however was soon at an end and for the remaining part of the week I heard every hour of the pride of my family the obstinacy of my father and of people better born than myself that were common servants  AT last on Saturday noon she told me with very visible satisfaction that Mrs Bombasine the great silkmercer's lady wanted a maid and a fine place it would be for there would be nothing to do but to clean my mistress's room get up her linen dress the young ladies wait at tea in the morning  take care of a little miss just come from nurse and then sit down to my needle But madam was a woman of great spirit and would not be contradicted and therefore I should take care for good places were not easily to be got  WITH these cautions I waited on madam Bombasine of whom the first sight gave me no ravishing ideas She was two yards round the waist her voice was at once loud and squeaking and her face brought to my mind the picture of the fullmoon Are you the young woman says she that are come to offer yourself It is strange when people of substance want a servant how soon it is the towntalk But they know they shall have a bellyfull that live with me Not like people at the other end of the town we dine at one o'clock But I never take any body without a character what friends do you come of I then told her that my father was a gentleman and that we had been unfortunateA great misfortune indeed to come to me and have three meals adaySo your father was a gentleman and you are a gentlewoman I supposesuch gentlewomenMadam I did not mean to claim any exemptions I only answered  your enquirySuch gentlewomen people should set their children to good trades and keep them off the parish Pray go to the other end of the town there are gentlewomen if they would pay their debts I am sure we have lost enough by gentlewomen Upon this her broad face grew broader with triumph and I was afraid she would have taken me for the pleasure of continuing her insult but happily the next word was Pray Mrs gentlewoman troop down stairs You may believe I obeyed her  I RETURNED and met with a better reception from my cousin than I expected for while I was out she had heard that Mrs Standish whose husband had lately been raised from a clerk in an office to be commissioner of the excise had taken a fine house and wanted a maid  TO Mrs Standish I went and after having waited six hours was at last admitted to the top of the stairs when she came out of her room with two of her company There was a smell of punch So young woman you want a place whence do you comeFrom the country madamYes they all come out of  the country And what brought you to town a bastard Where do you lodge At the SevenDials What you never heard of the foundling house Upon this they all laughed so obstreperously that I took the opportunity of sneaking off in the tumult  I THEN heard of a place at an elderly lady's She was at cards but in two hours I was told she would speak to me She asked me if I could keep an account and ordered me to write I wrote two lines out of some book that lay by her She wonder'd what people meant to breed up poor girls to write at that rate I suppose Mrs Flirt if I was to see your work it would be fine stuffYou may walk I will not have loveletters written from my house to every young fellow in the street  TWO days after I went on the same persuit to lady Lofty dressed as I was directed in what little ornaments I had because she had lately got a place at court Upon the first sight of me she turns to the woman that showed me in Is this the lady that wants a place Pray what place wou'd you have miss a maid of honour's place Servants now adaysMadam I heard you wantedWanted  what Somebody finer than myself A pretty servant indeedI should be afraid to speak to herI suppose Mrs Minx these fine hands cannot bear wettingA servant indeed Pray move offI am resolved to be the head person in this houseYou are ready dress'd the taverns will be open  I WENT to enquire for the next place in a clean linen gown and heard the servant tell his lady there was a young woman but he saw she would not do I was brought up however Are you the trollop that has the impudence to come for my place What you have hired that nasty gown and are come to steal a betterMadam I have another but being obliged to walkThen these are your manners with your blushes and your courtesies to come to me in your worst gown Madam give me leave to wait upon you in my other Wait on me you saucy slut Then you are sure of comingI could not let such a drab come near meHere you girl that came up with her have you touch'd her If you have wash your hands before you dress meSuch trollops Get you down What whimpering Pray walk  I WENT away with tears for my cousin had lost all patience However she told me that she had a respect for my relations was willing to keep me out of the street and would let me have another week  THE first day of this week I saw two places At one I was asked where I had lived And upon my answer was told by the lady that people should qualify themselves in ordinary places for she should never have done if she was to follow girls about At the other house I was a smirking hussy and that sweet face I might make money ofFor her part it was a rule with her never to take any creature that thought herself handsome  THE three next days were spent in lady Bluff's entry where I waited six hours every day for the pleasure of seeing the servants peep at me and go away laughingMadam will stretch her small shanks in the entry she will know the house againAt sunset the two first days I was told that my lady would see me tomorrow and on the third that her woman staid  MY week was now near its end and I had no hopes of a place My relation who always laid upon me the blame of every miscarriage told me that I must learn to humble myself and that all great ladies had particular ways that if I went on in that manner she could not tell who would keep me she had known many that had refused places sell their cloaths and beg in the streets  IT was to no purpose that the refusal was declared by me to be never on my side I was reasoning against interest and against stupidity and therefore I comforted myself with the hope of succeeding better in my next attempt and went to Mrs Courtly a very fine lady who had routs at her house and saw the best company in town  I HAD not waited two hours before I was called up and found Mr Courtly and his lady at piquet in the height of good humour This I looked on as a favourable sign and stood at the lower end of the room in expectation of the common questions At last Mr Courtly call'd out after a whisper Stand facing the light that one may see you I chang'd my  place and blush'd They frequently turn'd their eyes upon me and seem'd to discover many subjects of merriment for at every look they whisper'd and laugh'd with the most violent agitations of delight At last Mr Courtly cried out Is that colour your own child Yes says the lady if she has not robb'd the kitchen hearth This was so happy a conceit that it renew'd the storm of laughter and they threw down their cards in hopes of better sport The lady then called me to her and began with an affected gravity to enquire what I could do But first turn about and let us see your fine shape Well what are you fit for Mrs Mum You would find your tongue I suppose in the kitchen No no says Mr Courtly the girl's a good girl yet but I am afraid a brisk young fellow with fine tags on his shoulderCome child hold up your head what you have stole nothingNot yet says the lady but she hopes to steal your heart quicklyHere was a laugh of happiness and triumph prolonged by the confusion which I could no longer repress At last the lady recollected herself Stole nobut if I had her I should watch her for that downcast eyeWhy cannot you look people in the face  Steal says her husband she would steal nothing but perhaps a few ribbands before they were left off by her lady Sir answer'd I why should you by supposing me a thief insult one from whom you have received no injury Insult says the lady are you come here to be a servant you saucy baggage and talk of insulting What will this world come to if a gentleman may not jest with a servant Well such servants pray be gone and see when you will have the honour to be so insulted again Servants insulteda fine timeInsulted Get down stairs you slut or the footman shall insult you  THE last day of the last week was now coming and my kind cousin talked of sending me down in the waggon to preserve me from bad courses But in the morning she came and told me that she had one trial more for me Euphemia wanted a maid and perhaps I might do for her for like me she must fall her crest being forced to lay down her chariot upon the loss of half her fortune by bad securities and with her way of giving her money to every body that pretended to want it she could have little beforehand therefore I  might serve her for with all her fine sense she must not pretend to be nice  I WENT immediately and met at the door a young gentlewoman who told me she had herself been hired that morning but that she was order'd to bring any that offered up stairs I was accordingly introduced to Euphemia who when I came in laid down her book and told me that she sent for me not to gratify an idle curiosity but lest my disappointment might be made still more grating by incivility that she was in pain to deny any thing much more what was no favour that she saw nothing in my appearance which did not make her wish for my company but that another whose claims might perhaps be equal had come before me The thought of being so near to such a place and missing it brought tears into my eyes and my sobs hinder'd me from returning my acknowledgments She rose up confused and supposing by my concern that I was distressed placed me by her and made me tell her my story which when she had heard she put two guineas in my hand ordering me to lodge near her and make use of her table till she could provide  for me I am now under her protection and know not how to shew my gratitude better than by giving this account to the RAMBLER  ZOSIMA  NUMB  TUESDAY  May    Commissumqae teges vino tortus irâ  HOR  IT is related by Quintus Curtius that the Persians always conceived a lasting and invincible contempt of a man who had violated the laws of secrecy for they thought that however he might be deficient in the qualities requisite to actual excellence the negative virtues at least were always in his power and though he perhaps could not speak well if he was to try it was still easy for him not to speak  IN this opinion of the easiness of secrecy they seem to have consider'd it as opposed not to treachery but loquacity and to have conceived the man whom they thus censured not frighted by menaces to reveal or bribed  by promises to betray but incited by the mere pleasure of talking or some other motive equally trivial to lay open his heart without reflection and to let whatever he knew slip from him only for want of power to retain it Whether by their settled and avowed scorn of thoughtless talkers the Persians were able to diffuse to any great extent the virtue of taciturnity we are hindered by the distance of those times from being able to discover there being very few memoirs remaining of the court of Persepolis nor any distinct accounts handed down to us of their office clerks their ladies of the bedchamber their attorneys their chambermaids or their footmen  IN these latter ages though the old animosity against a prattler is still retained it appears wholly to have lost its effects upon the conduct of mankind for secrets are so seldom kept that it may with some reason be doubted whether the antients were not mistaken in their first postulate whether the quality of retention be so generally bestowed and whether a secret has not some subtle volatility by which it escapes almost imperceptibly at the smallest vent or some power of fermentation by  which it expands itself so as to burst the heart that will not give it way  THOSE that study either the body or the mind of man very often find the most specious and pleasing theory falling under the weight of contrary experience and instead of gratifying their vanity by inferring effects from causes they are always reduced at last to conjecture causes from effects That it is easy to be secret the speculatist can demonstrate in his retreat and therefore thinks himself justified in placing confidence the man of the world knows that whether difficult or not it is uncommon and therefore finds himself rather inclined to search after the reason of this universal failure in one of the most important duties of society  THE vanity of being known to be trusted with a secret is generally one of the chief motives to disclose it for however absurd it may be thought to boast an honour by an act which shews that it was conferred without merit yet most men seem rather inclined to confess the want of virtue than of importance and more willingly shew their influence and their power though at the expence of their probity than glide through life with no other pleasure  than the private consciousness of fidelity which while it is preserved must be without praise except from the single person who tries and knows it  THERE are many ways of telling a secret by which a man exempts himself from the reproaches of his conscience and gratifies his pride without suffering himself to believe that he impairs his virtue He tells the private affairs of his patron or his friend only to those from whom he would not conceal his own he tells them to those who have no temptation to betray their trust or with a denunciation of a certain forfeiture of his friendship if he discovers that they become public  SECRETS are very frequently told in the first ardour of kindness or of love for the sake of proving by so important a sacrifice the sincerity of professions or the warmth of tenderness but with this motive though it be sometimes strong in itself vanity generally concurs since every man naturally desires to be most esteemed by those whom he loves or with whom he converses with whom he passes his hours of pleasure and to whom he retires from business and from care  WHEN the discovery of secrets is under consideration there is always a distinction carefully to be made between our own and those of another those of which we are fully masters as they affect only our own interest and those which are reposited with us in trust and involve the happiness or convenience of such as we have no right to expose to hazard by experiments upon their lives without their consent To tell our own secrets is generally folly but that folly is without guilt to communicate those with which we are intrusted is always treachery and treachery for the most part combined with folly  THERE have indeed been some enthusiastic and irrational zealots for friendship who have maintained and perhaps believed that one friend has a right to all that is in possession of another and that therefore it is a violation of kindness to exempt any secret from this boundless confidence Accordingly a late female minister of state has been shameless enough to inform the world that she used when she wanted to extract any thing from her sovereign to remind her of Montaigne's reasoning who has determined that to tell a secret to a friend  is no breach of fidelity because the number of persons trusted is not multiplied a man and his friend being virtually the same  THAT such a fallacy could be imposed upon any human understanding or that an author could have been imagined to advance a position so remote from truth and reason any otherwise than as a declaimer to shew to what extent he could stretch his imagination and with what strength he could press his principle would scarcely have been credible had not this lady kindly shewn us how far weakness may be deluded or indolence amused But since it appears that even this sophistry has been able with the help of a strong desire to repose in quiet upon the understanding of another to mislead honest intentions and an understanding not contemptible it may not be superfluous to remark that those things which are common among friends are only such as either possesses in his own right and can alienate or destroy without injury to any other person Without this limitation confidence must run on without end the second person may tell the secret to the third upon the same principle as he received it from the  first and the third may hand it forward to a fourth till at last it is told in the round of friendship to them from whom it was the first intention chiefly to conceal it  THE confidence which Caius has of the faithfulness of Titius is nothing more than an opinion which himself cannot know to be true and which Claudius who first tells his secret to Caius may know at least may suspect to be false and therefore the trust is transferred by Caius if he reveal what has been told him to one from whom the person originally concerned would probably have withheld it and whatever may be the event Caius has hazarded the happiness of his friend without necessity and without permission and has put that trust in the hand of fortune which was given only to virtue  ALL the arguments upon which a man who is telling the private affairs of another may ground his confidence of security he must upon reflection know to be uncertain because he finds them without effect upon himself When he is imagining that Titius will be cautious from a regard to his interest his reputation or his duty he ought to reflect that he is  himself at that instant acting in opposition to all these reasons and revealing what interest reputation and duty direct him to conceal  EVERY one feels that he should consider the man incapable of trust who believed himself at liberty to tell whatever he knew to the first whom he should conclude deserving of his confidence therefore Caius in admitting Titius to the affairs imparted only to himself violates his faith since he acts contrary to the intention of Claudius to whom that faith was given For promises of friendship are like all others useless and vain unless they are made in some known sense adjusted and acknowledged by both parties  I AM not ignorant that many questions may be started relating to the duty of secrecy where the affairs are of publick concern where subsequent reasons may arise to alter the appearance and nature of the trust that the manner in which the secret was told may change the degree of obligation and that the principles upon which a man is chosen for a confident may not always equally constrain him But these scruples if not too intricate are of too extensive consideration for my present purpose  nor are they such as generally occur in common life and though casuistical knowledge be useful in proper hands yet it ought by no means to be carelesly exposed since most will use it rather to lull than awaken their own consciences and the threads of reasoning on which truth is suspended are frequently drawn to such subtility that common eyes cannot perceive and common sensibility cannot feel them  THE whole doctrine as well as practice of secrecy is so perplexing and dangerous that next to him who is compelled to trust I think him unhappy who is chosen to be trusted for he is often involved in scruples without the liberty of calling in the help of any other understanding he is frequently drawn into guilt under the appearance of friendship and honesty and sometimes subjected to suspicion by the treachery of others who are engaged without his knowledge in the same schemes for he that has one confident has generally more and when he is at last betrayed is in doubt on whom he shall fix the crime  THE rules therefore that I shall propose concerning secrecy and from which I think it not safe to deviate without long and exact  deliberation areNever to solicit the knowledge of a secret Not willingly nor without many limitations to accept such confidence when it is offered When a secret is once admitted to consider the trust as of a very high nature important as society and sacred as truth and therefore not to be violated for any incidental convenience or slight appearance of contrary fitness  NUMB  SATURDAY  May    Nil fuit unquam  Sic dispar sibi  HOR  AMONG the many inconsistencies which folly produces or infirmity suffers in the human mind there has often been observed a manifest and striking contrariety between the life of an author and his writings and Milton in a letter to a learned stranger by whom he had been visited with great reason congratulates himself upon the consciousness of being found equal to his own character and having preserved in a private and familiar interview that reputation which his works had procured him  THOSE whom the appearance of virtue or the evidence of genius have tempted to a nearer knowledge of the writer in whose performances they may be found have indeed had frequent reason to repent their curiosity the bubble that sparkled before them has become common water at the touch and the phantom of perfection has vanished when they wished to press it to their bosom They have lost the pleasure of imagining how far humanity may be exalted and perhaps feel themselves less inclined to toil up the sleeps of virtue when they observe those who seem best able to point the way loitering below as either afraid of the labour or doubtful of the reward  IT has been long the custom of the oriental monarchs to hide themselves in their gardens and their palaces to avoid the conversation of mankind and to be known to their subjects only by their edicts The same policy is no less necessary to him that writes than to him that governs for men would not more patiently submit to be taught than commanded by one who should be known to have the same follies and weaknesses with themselves  Perhaps a sudden intruder into the closet of an author would feel equal surprise and indignation with the officer who having long solicited admission into the presence of Sardanapalus saw him at last not consulting upon laws enquiring into grievances planning fortifications or modelling armies but employed in feminine amusements and directing the ladies in their work  IT is not difficult to conceive however that for many reasons a man writes much better than he lives For without entering into refined speculations it is many degrees easier to design than to perform A man proposes his schemes of life in a state of abstraction and disengagement exempt from the enticements of hope the solicitations of affection the importunities of appetite or the depressions of fear and is in the same state with him that teaches upon land the art of navigation to whom the sea is always smooth and the wind is always prosperous  THE mathematicians are well acquainted with the difference between pure science which has to do only with ideas and the application of its laws to the use of life in which  they are constrained to submit to the imperfection of matter and the influence of accidents thus in moral discussions it is to be remembred that many impediments obstruct our practice which very easily give way to theory The speculatist is only in danger of error but the man involved in life has his own passions and those of others to encounter and is embarrassed with a thousand inconveniences on every side which confound him with variety of impulse and either perplex or obstruct his way He is often forced to act without deliberation and obliged to choose before he can examine he is often surprised by sudden alterations of the state of things and changes his measures according to superficial appearances he is often led by others either because he is indolent or because he is timorous he is sometimes afraid to know what is right and sometimes finds others diligent to deceive him  WE are therefore not to wonder that most fail amidst tumult and snares and danger in the observance of those precepts which they laid down in solitude safety and tranquillity with a mind unbiassed and with liberty unobstructed It is the condition of  our present state to see more than we can attain the exactest vigilance and caution can never maintain a single day of pure and unmingled innocence much less can the utmost efforts of incorporated mind reach the summits of speculative virtue  IT is however necessary for the idea of perfection to be proposed that we may have some object to which our endeavours are to be directed and he that is most deficient in the duties of life makes some atonement for his faults by warning others against his own failings and endeavouring by the salubrity of his admonitions to hinder the contagion of his example  NOTHING is more unreasonable however common than to charge with hypocrisy him that expresses zeal for those virtues which he neglects to practise since he may be sincerely convinced of the advantages of conquering his passions without having yet obtained the victory as a man may be confident of the advantages of a voyage or a journey without having courage or industry to undertake it and may honestly recommend to others those attempts which he neglects himself  THE interest which the corrupt part of mankind have in hardening themselves against every motive to amendment has disposed them to give to these contradictions when they can be produced against the cause of virtue that weight which they will not allow them in any other case They see men act in opposition to their interest without supposing on other occasions that they do not know it they see them give way to the sudden violence of passion and forsake the most important persuits for trivial pleasures without imagining that they have changed their sentiments or approve their own conduct In moral or religious questions alone they resolve to determine the sentiments by the actions and charge every man with endeavouring to impose upon the world whose writings are not confirmed by his life They never consider that they themselves neglect or practise something every day inconsistently with their own settled opinion nor discover that the conduct of the advocates for virtue can little increase or lessen the obligations of their dictates argument is to be invalidated only by argument and is in itself of the same force whether or not it convinces him by whom it is proposed  YET since this prejudice however unreasonable is always likely to have some prevalence it is the duty of every man to take care lest he should hinder the efficacy of his own instructions When he desires to gain the belief of others he should shew that he believes himself and when he teaches the fitness of virtue by his reasonings he should by his example prove its possibility Thus much at least may be required of him that he shall not act worse than others because he writes better nor imagine that by the merit of his genius he may claim some indulgence beyond mortals of the lower classes and be excused for want of prudence or neglect of virtue  BACON in his History of the winds after having offered something to the imagination as desirable often proposes lower advantages in its place to the reason as attainable The same method may be sometimes pursued in moral endeavours which this philosopher has observed in natural enquiries and having first set positive and absolute excellence before us we may be pardoned though we sink down to humbler virtue trying however to keep our point always in view and struggling  not to lose ground though we cannot gain it  IT is recorded of Sir Matthew Hale that he for a long time concealed the consecration of himself to the stricter duties of religion lest by some flagitious and shameful action he should bring piety into disgrace For the same reason it may be prudent for a writer who apprehends that he shall not enforce his own maxims by his domestic character to conceal his name that he may not injure them  THERE are indeed a far greater number whose curiosity to gain a more familiar knowledge of successful writers is not so much prompted by an opinion of their power to improve as to delight and who expect from them not arguments against vice or dissertations on temperance or justice but flights of wit strains of humour and sallies of pleasantry or at least acute remarks nice distinctions justness of sentiment and elegance of diction  THIS expectation is indeed specious and probable and yet such is the fate of all human hopes that it is very often frustrated and  those who raise admiration by their books disgust by their company A man of letters for the most part spends in the privacies of study that season of life in which the manners are to be softened into ease and polished into elegance and when he has gained knowledge enough to be respected has neglected the minuter acts by which he might have pleased When he enters life if of a weak and timorous temper he is diffident and bashful from the knowledge of his defects or if he was born with spirit and resolution he is ferocious and arrogant from the consciousness of his merit he is either dissipated by the awe of superior company and unable to assemble his ideas recollect his reading and arrange his arguments or he is hot and dogmatical quick in opposition and tenacious in defence disabled by his own violence and confused by his haste to triumph  THE graces of writing and conversation are of different kinds and though he who excels in one might have been with opportunity and application equally successful in the other yet as many please by extemporary talk though utterly unacquainted with the more accurate method and more laboured beauties which  composition requires so it is very possible that men wholly accustomed to works of study may want that readiness of conception and affluence of language always necessary to colloquial entertainment They may want address to watch the hints which conversation offers for the display of their particular attainments or they may be so much unfurnished with matter on common subjects that discourse not professedly literary glides over them as heterogeneous bodies without admitting their conceptions to mix in the circulation  A TRANSITION from an author's books to his conversation is too often like an entrance into a large city after a distant prospect Remotely we see nothing but spires of temples and turrets of palaces and imagine it the residence of splendor grandeur and magnificence but when we have passed the gates we find it perplexed with narrow passages disgraced with despicable cottages embarrassed with obstructions and clouded with smoke  NUMB  TUESDAY  May    Et quando uberior vitiorum copia Quando  Major avaritiae patuit sinus Alca quando  Hos animes  JUV  THERE is no grievance publick or private of which since I took upon me the office of a periodical monitor I have received so many or so earnest complaints as of the predominance of play of a fatal passion for cards and dice which seems to have overturned not only the ambition of excellence but the desire of pleasure to have extinguished the flames of the lover as well as of the patriot and threatens in its further progress to destroy all distinctions both of rank and sex to crush all emulation but that of fraud to corrupt all those classes of our people whose ancestors have by their virtue their industry or their parfimony given them the power of living in extravagance idleness and vice and to leave them without knowledge but of the modish games and without wishes but for lucky hands  I HAVE found by long experience that there are few enterprises so hopeless as contests with the fashion in which the opponents are not only made confident by their numbers and strong by their union but are hardened by contempt of their antagonist whom they always look upon as a wretch of low notions contracted views mean conversation and narrow fortune who envies the elevations which he cannot reach who would gladly imbitter the happiness which his obscurity his inelegance or his indigence deny him to partake and who has no other end in his advice than to revenge his own mortifications by hindering those whom their birth and taste have set above them from the enjoyment of their superiority and bringing them down to a level with himself  THOUGH I have never found myself much affected by this formidable censure which I have incurred often enough to be acquainted with its full force yet I shall in some measure obviate it on this occasion by offering very little in my own name either of argument or intreaty since those who suffer by  this general infatuation may be supposed best able to relate its effects  SIR  THERE seems to be so little knowledge left in the world and so little of that reflection practised by which knowledge is to be gained that I am in doubt whether I shall be understood when I complain of want of opportunity for thinking or whether a condemnation which at present seems irreversible to perpetual ignorance will raise any compassion either in you or your readers yet I will venture to lay my state before you because I believe it is natural to most minds to take some pleasure in complaining of evils of which they have no reason to be ashamed  I AM the daughter of a man of great fortune whose diffidence of mankind and perhaps the pleasure of continual accumulation incline him to reside upon his own estate and to educate his children in his own house where I was bred if not with the most brilliant examples of virtue before my eyes at least remote enough from any incitements to vice and wanting neither leisure nor books nor  the acquaintance of some persons of learning in the neighbourhood I endeavour'd to acquire such knowledge as might most recommend me to esteem and thought myself able to support a conversation upon most of the subjects which my sex and my condition made it proper for me to understand  I HAD besides my knowledge as my mamma and my maid told me a very fine face and elegant shape and with all these advantages had been seventeen months the reigning toast for twelve miles round and never came to the monthly assembly but I heard the old ladies that sat by wishing that  it might end well  and their daughters criticising my air my features or my dress  YOU know Mr Rambler that ambition is natural to youth and curiosity to understanding and therefore will hear without wonder that I was desirous to extend my victories over those who might give more honour to the conqueror and that I found in a country life a continual repetition of the same pleasures which was not sufficient to fill up the mind for the present or raise any expectations of the  future and I will confess to you that I was impatient for a sight of the town and filled my thoughts with the discoveries which I should make the triumphs that I should obtain and the praises that I should receive  AT last the time came My aunt whose husband has a seat in parliament and a place at court buried her only child and sent for me to supply the loss The hope that I should so far insinuate myself into their favour as to obtain a considerable augmentation of my fortune procured me every convenience for my departure with great expedition and I could not amidst all my transports forbear some indignation to see with what readiness the natural guardians of my virtue sold me to a state which they thought more hazardous than it really was as soon as a new accession of fortune glittered in their eyes  THREE days I was upon the road and on the fourth morning my heart danced at the sight of London I was set down at my aunt's and entered upon the scene of action I expected now from the age and experience of my aunt some lessons of prudential conduct  but after the first civilties and first tears were over was told what pity it was to have kept so fine a girl so long in the country for that people who did not begin young seldom dealt their cards handsomely or played them tolerably  YOUNG persons are commonly inclined to slight the remarks and counsels of their elders I smiled perhaps with too much contempt and was upon the point of telling her that my time had not been past in such trivial attainments But I soon found that things are to be estimated not by the importance of their effects but the frequency of their use  A FEW days after my aunt gave me notice that some company which she had been six weeks in collecting was to meet that evening and she expected a finer assembly than had been seen all the winter She expressed this in the jargon of a gamester and when I asked an explication of her terms of art wondered where I had lived I had already found my aunt so incapable of any rational conclusion and so ignorant of every thing whether great or little that I had lost all regard to her opinion  and dressed myself with great expectations of an opportunity to display my charms among rivals whose competition would not dishonour me The company came in and after the cursory compliments of salutation alike easy to the lowest and the highest understanding what was the result The cards were broke open the parties were formed the whole night passed in a game upon which the young and old were equally employed nor was I able to attract an eye or gain an ear but being compelled to play without skill I perpetually embarrassed my partner and soon perceived the contempt of the whole table gathering upon me  I CANNOT but suspect Sir that this odious fashion is produced by a conspiracy of the old the ugly and the ignorant against the young and beautiful the witty and the gay as a contrivance to level all distinctions of nature and of art to confound the world in a chaos of folly to take from those who could outshine them all the advantages of mind and body to withold youth from its natural pleasures deprive wit of its influence and beauty of its charms to fix those hearts upon money to  which we have hitherto been entitled to sink life into a tedious uniformity and to allow it no other hopes or fears but those of robbing and being robbed  BE pleased Sir to inform those of my sex who have minds capable of nobler sentiments that if they will unite in vindication of their pleasures and their prerogatives they may fix a time at which cards shall cease to be in fashion or be left only to those who have neither beauty to be loved nor spirit to be feared neither knowledge to teach nor modesty to learn and who having passed their youth in vice are justly condemned to spend their age in folly  I am SIR c CLEORA  SIR  VEXATION will burst my heart if I do not give it vent As you publish a paper I insist upon it that you insert this in your next as ever you hope for the kindness and encouragement of any women of taste spirit and virtue I would have it published to the world how deserving wives are used by imperious coxcombs that henceforth no woman  may marry who has not the patience of Grizzel Nay if even Grizzel had been married to a gamester her temper would never have held out A wretch that loses his good humour and humanity along with his money and will not allow enough from his own extravagances to support a woman of fashion in the necessary amusements of lifeWhy does not he employ his wise head to make a figure in parliament raise an estate and get a title That would be fitter for the master of a family than rattling a noisy dicebox and then he might indulge his wife in a few slight expences and elegant diversions  WHAT if I was unfortunate at Bragshould he not have stayed to see how luck would turn another time Instead of that what does he do but picks a quarrel upbraids me with loss of beauty abuses my acquaintance ridicules my play and insults my understanding says forsooth that women have not heads enough to play with any thing but dolls and that they should be employed in things proportionable to their understanding keep at home and mind family affairs  I DO stay at home Sir and all the town  knows I am at home every Sunday I have had six routs this winter and sent out ten packs of cards in invitations to private parties As for management I am sure he cannot call me extravagant or say I do not mind my family The children are out at nurse in villages as cheap as any two little brats can be kept nor have I ever seen them since so he has no trouble about them The servants live at board wages My own dinners come from the Thatch'd house and I have never paid a penny for any thing I have bought since I was married As for play I do think I may indeed indulge in that now I am my own mistress Papa made me drudge at whist 'till I was tired of it and far from wanting a head Mr Hoyle when he had not given me above forty lessons said I was one of his best scholars I thought then with myself that if once I was at liberty I would leave play and take to reading romances things so forbidden at our house and so railed at that it was impossible nor to fancy them very charming Most fortunately to save me from absolute undutifulness just as I was married came dear Brag into fashion and ever since it has been the joy of my life so easy so chearful and careless so void of thought and so genteel  Who can help loving it Yet the perfidious thing has used me very ill of late and tomorrow I should have changed it for Faro But oh this detestable tomorrow a thing always expected and never foundWithin this few hours must I be dragged into the country The wretch Sir left me in a sit which his threatenings had occasioned and unmercifully ordered a postchaise Stay I cannot for money I have none and credit I cannot getBut I will make the monkey play with me at picquet upon the road for all I want I am almost sure to beat him and his debts of honour I know he will pay Then who can tell but I may still come back and conquer lady Packer Sir you need not print this last scheme and upon second thoughts you mayOh distraction the postchaise is at the door Sir publish what you will only let it be printed without a name  NUMB  SATURDAY  May    Multis dicendi copia torrens  Et sua mortifera est facundia  JUV  SIR  I AM the modest young man whom you favoured with your advice in a late paper and as I am very far from suspecting that you foresaw the numberless inconveniences which I have by following it brought upon myself I will lay my condition open before you for you seem bound to extricate me from the perplexities in which your counsel however innocent in the intention has contributed to involve me  YOU told me as you thought to my comfort that a writer might easily find means of introducing his genius to the world for the  press of England was open  This I have now fatally experienced the press is indeed open  Facilis descensus Averni  Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis  THE means of doing hurt to ourselves are  always at hand I immediately sent to a printer and contracted with him for an impression of several thousands of my pamphlet While it was at the press I was seldom absent from the printinghouse and continually urged the workmen to haste by solicitations promises and rewards From the day all other pleasures were excluded by the delightful employment of correcting the sheets and from the night sleep was generally banished by anticipations of the happiness which every hour was bringing nearer  AT last the time of publication approached and my heart beat with the raptures of an author I was above all little precautions and in defiance of envy or of criticism set my name upon the title without sufficiently considering that what has once passed the press is irrevocable and that though the printinghouse may properly be compared to the infernal regions for the facility of its entrance and the difficulty with which authors return from it yet there is this difference that a great genius can never return to his former state by a happy draught of the waters of oblivion  I AM now Mr Rambler known to be an author and am condemned irreversibly condemned to all the miseries of high reputation The first morning after publication my friends assembled about me I presented each as is usual with a copy of my book They looked into the first pages but were hindered by their admiration from reading farther The first pages are indeed very elaborate Some passages they particularly dwelt upon as more eminently beautiful than the rest and some more delicate strokes and secret elegancies I pointed out to them which had escaped their observation I then begged of them to forbear their compliments and invited them I could not do less to dine with me at a tavern After dinner the book was resumed but their praises very often so much overpowered my modesty that I was forced to put about the glass and had often no means of repressing the clamours of their admiration but by thundering to the drawer for another bottle  NEXT morning another set of my acquaintance congratulated me upon my performance with such importunity of praise that I was  again forced to obviate their civilities by a treat On the third day I had yet a greater number of applauders to put to silence in the same manner and on the fourth those whom I had entertained the first day came again having in the perusal of the remaining part of the book discovered so many forcible sentences and masterly touches that it was impossible for me to bear the repetition of their commendations I therefore persuaded them once more to adjourn to the tavern and choose some other subject on which I might share in the conversation But it was not in their power to withold their attention from my performance which had so intirely taken possession of their minds that no intreaties of mind could change their topick and I was obliged to stifle with claret that praise which neither my modesty could hinder nor my uneasiness redress  THE whole week was thus spent in a kind of literary revel and I have now found that nothing is so expensive as great abilities unless there is join'd with them an insatiable eagerness of praise for to escape from the pain of hearing myself exalted above the greatest names dead and living of the learned world it has  already cost me two hogsheads of port fifteen gallons of arrack ten dozen of claret and five and forty bottles of champagne  I WAS resolved to stay at home no longer and therefore rose early and went to the coffeehouse but found that I had now made myself too eminent for happiness and that I was no longer to enjoy the pleasure of mixing upon equal terms with the rest of the world As soon as I enter the room I see part of the company raging with envy which they endeavour to conceal sometimes with the appearance of laughter and sometimes with that of contempt but the disguise is such that I can discover the secret rancour of their hearts and as envy is deservedly its own punishment I frequently indulge myself in tormenting them with my presence  BUT though there may be some slight satisfaction received from the mortification of my enemies yet my benevolence will not suffer me to take any pleasure in the terrors of my friends I have been cautious since the appearance of my work not to give myself more premeditated airs of superiority than the most rigid humility might allow It is indeed  not impossible that I may sometimes have laid down my opinion in a manner that shewed a consciousness of my ability to maintain it or interrupted the conversation when I saw its tendency without suffering the speaker to waste his time in explaining his sentiments and indeed I did indulge myself for two days in a custom of drumming with my fingers when the company began to lose themselves in absurdities or to encroach upon subjects which I knew them unqualified to discuss But I generally acted with great appearance of respect even to those whose stupidity I pitied in my heart Yet notwithstanding this exemplary moderation so universal is the dread of uncommon powers and such the unwillingness of mankind to be made wiser that I have now for some days found myself shunned by all my acquaintance If I knock at a door no body is at home if I enter a coffeehouse I have the box to myself I live in the town like a lion in his desart or an eagle on his rock too great for friendship or society and condemned to solitude by unhappy elevation and dreaded ascendency  NOR is my character only formidable to others but burdensome to myself I naturally  love to talk without much thinking to scatter my merriment at random and to relax my thoughts with ludicrous remarks and fanciful images but such is now the importance of my opinion that I am afraid to offer it lest by being established too hastily into a maxim it should be the occasion of error to half the nation and such is the expectation with which I am attended when I am going to speak that I frequently pause to reflect whether what I am about to utter is worthy of myself  THIS Sir is sufficiently miserable but there are still greater calamities behind You must have read how men of parts have had their closets rifled and their cabinets broke open at the instigation of piratical booksellers for the profit of their works and it is apparent that there are many prints now sold in the shops of men whom you cannot suspect of sitting for that purpose and whose likenesses must have been certainly stolen when their names made their faces vendible These considerations at first put me on my guard and I have indeed found sufficient reason for my caution for I have discovered many people examining my countenance with a curiosity that shewed their intention  to draw it I immediately left the house but find the same behaviour in another  OTHERS may be persecuted but I am hunted I have good reason to believe that eleven painters are now dogging me for they know that he who can get my face first will make his fortune I often change my wig and wear my hat over my eyes by which I hope somewhat to confound them for you know it is not fair to sell my face without admitting me to share the profit  I AM however not so much in pain for my face as for my papers which I dare neither carry with me nor leave behind I have indeed taken some measures for their preservation having put them in an iron chest and fixed a padlock upon my closet I change my lodgings five times a week and always remove at the dead of night  THUS I live in consequence of having given too great proofs of a predominant genius in the solitude of a hermit with the anxiety of a miser and the caution of an outlaw afraid to shew my face lest it should be copied afraid to speak lest I should injure my character  and to write lest my correspondents should publish my letters always uneasy lest my servants should steal my papers for the sake of money or my friends for that of the publick This it is to soar above the rest of mankind and this representation I lay before you that I may be informed how to divest myself of the laurels which are so cumbersome to the wearer and descend to the enjoyment of that quiet from which I find a writer of the first class so fatally debarred  MISELLUS  NUMB  TUESDAY  May    Me non oracula certum  Sed mors certa facit  LUCAN  IT is recorded of some eastern monarch that he kept an officer in his house whose employment it was to remind him of his mortality by calling out every morning at a stated hour  Remember prince that thou shalt die  And the contemplation of the frailness and uncertainty of our present state appeared of so much importance to Solon of Athens that he left this precept to future ages  Keep thine eye fixed upon the end of life  A FREQUENT and attentive prospect of that hour which must put a period to all our schemes and deprive us of all our acquisitions is indeed of the utmost efficacy to the just and rational disposition of our affairs and the wise and happy regulation of our lives nor would ever any thing wicked or often any thing absurd be undertaken or prosecuted by him who should begin every day with a serious reflection that he is born to die  THE disturbers of our happiness in this world are our desires our griefs and our fears and to all these the frequent consideration of death is a certain and adequate remedy Think says Epictetus frequently on poverty banishment and death and thou wilt then never indulge any violent desire or give up thy heart to any mean sentiment    THAT the maxim of Epictetus is founded on just observation will easily be granted when we reflect how that vehemence of eagerness after the common objects of persuit is kindled in our minds We represent to  ourselves the pleasures of some future possession and suffer our thoughts to dwell attentively upon it till it has wholly ingrossed the imagination and permits us not to conceive any other happiness than its attainment or any other misery than its loss every other satisfaction which the bounty of providence has scattered over life is neglected as inconsiderable in comparison of the great object which we have placed before us thrown from us as incumbering our activity or trampled under foot as standing in our way  EVERY man has experienced how much of this ardour has remitted when a sharp or tedious sickness has set death before his eyes The extensive influence of greatness the glitter of wealth the praises of admirers and the attendance of supplicants have appeared vain and empty things when the last hour has seemed to be approaching and the same appearance they would always have if the same thought was always predominant We should then find the absurdity of stretching out our arms incessantly to grasp that which we cannot keep and wearing out our lives in endeavours to add new turrets to the fabrick of ambition when the foundation itself is shaking and  the ground on which it stands is mouldering away  ALL envy is proportionate to desire we are uneasy at the attainments of another according as we think our own happiness would be advanced by the addition of that which he witholds from us and therefore whatever depresses immoderate wishes will at the same time set the heart free from the corrosion of envy and exempt us from that vice which is above most others tormenting to ourselves hateful to the world and productive of mean artifices and sordid projects He that considers how soon he must close his life will find nothing of so much importance as to close it well and will therefore look with indifference upon whatever is useless to that purpose Whoever reflects frequently upon the uncertainty of his own duration will easily find out that the state of others is not more permanent and that what can confer nothing on himself very desirable cannot so much improve the condition of a rival as to make him in any great degree superior to those from whom he has carried the prize a prize too mean to excite a very obstinate opposition  EVEN grief that passion to which the virtuous and tender mind is more particularly subject will be obviated or alleviated by the same reflection It will be obviated if all the blessings of our condition are enjoyed with a constant sense of the uncertain tenure by which they are held If we remember that whatever we possess is to be in our hands but a very little time and that the little which our most lively hopes can promise us may be made less by ten thousand accidents we shall not much repine at a loss of which we cannot estimate the value but of which though we cannot tell the least amount we know with sufficient certainty the greatest and are convinced that the greatest is not much to be regretted  BUT if any passion has so much usurped our understanding as not to suffer us to enjoy our advantages with the moderation prescribed by reason and by virtue it is not too late to apply this remedy when we find ourselves sinking under sorrow and inclined to pine for that which is irrecoverably vanished We may then usefully revolve the uncertainty of our own condition and the folly of lamenting  that from which if it had stayed little longer we should ourselves have been taken away  WITH regard to the sharpest and most melting sorrow that which arises from the loss of those whom we have loved with tenderness it may be observed that friendship between mortals can be contracted on no other terms than that one must sometime mourn for the other's death And this grief will always yield to the surviver one consolation proportionate to his affliction for the pain whatever it be that he himself feels his friend has escaped  NOR is fear the most overbearing and resistless of all our passions less to be temperated by this universal medicine of the mind The frequent contemplation of death as it shows the vanity of all human good discovers likewise the lightness of all terrestrial evil which certainly can last no longer than the subject upon which it acts and according to the old observation must be shorter as it is more violent The most cruel calamity which misfortune can produce must by the necessity of nature be quickly at an end The soul cannot  long be held in prison but will fly away and leave a lifeless body to human malice  Ridetque sui ludibria trunci  THE utmost that we can threaten to one another is that death which indeed we may precipitate but cannot retard and from which therefore it cannot become a wise man to buy a reprieve at the expence of his virtue since he knows not how small a portion of time he can purchase which whether short or long will be made less valuable by the remembrance of the price by which it has been obtained He is sure that he destroys his happiness but is not sure that he lengthens his life  THE known shortness of life as it ought to moderate our passions may likewise with equal propriety contract our designs There is not time for the most forcible genius and most active industry to extend its effects beyond a certain sphere To project the conquest of the world is the madness of some mighty princes to hope for excellence in every science has been the folly of some men of uncommon genius and both have found at last that they have panted for a height of  eminence denied to humanity and have lost many opportunities of making themselves useful and happy by a vain ambition of obtaining a species of honour which the eternal laws of providence have placed beyond the reach of man  THE miscarriages of the great designs of princes are recorded in the histories of the world but when they are read are of little use to the bulk of mankind who seem very little interested in admonitions against errors which they cannot commit But the fate of literary ambition is a proper subject for every scholar to consider for who has not had occasion to regret the dissipation of great abilities in a boundless multiplicity of persuits to lament the sudden desertion of many excellent designs upon the offer of some other subject made more inviting by its novelty and to observe the inaccuracy and deficiencies of works left unfinished by too great an extention of the plan  IT is always pleasing to observe how much more our minds can conceive than our bodies can perform yet it is our duty while we continue in this complicated stato to regulato  one part of our composition by some regard to the other We are not to indulge our corporeal appetites with pleasures that impair our intellectual vigour nor gratify our minds with schemes which we know our lives must fail in attempting to execute The uncertainty of our duration ought at once to set bounds to our designs and add incitements to our industry and when we find ourselves inclined either to immensity in our schemes or sluggishness in our endeavours we may either check or animate ourselves by recollecting with the father of physic  that art is long and life is short  NUMB  SATURDAY  May    Illic matre carentibus  Privignis mulier temperat innocens  Nec dotata regit virum  Conjux nec nitido fidit adultero  Dos est magna parentum  Virtus et metuens alterius tori  Certo foedere castitas  HOR  THERE is no observation more frequently made by such as employ themselves in surveying the conduct of mankind than  that marriage though the dictate of nature and the institution of providence is yet very often the cause of misery and that those who enter into that state can seldom forbear to express their repentance of the folly and their envy of those whom either chance or caution has witheld from it  THIS general unhappiness has given occasion to many sage maxims among the serious and smart remarks among the gay the moralist and the writer of epigrams have equally shown their abilities upon it some have lamented and some have ridiculed it but as the faculty of writing has been chiefly a masculine endowment the reproach of making the world miserable has been always thrown upon the women and the grave and the merry have equally thought themselves at liberty to conclude either with declamatory complaints or satirical censures of female folly or fickleness ambition or cruelty extravagance or lust  LED by such a number of examples and incited by my share in the common interest sometimes venture to consider this universal grievance having endeavoured to divest my  heart of all partiality and place myself as a kind of neutral being between the sexes whose clamours if we attend only to the world passing before us being equally loud and vented on both sides with all the vehemence of distress all the apparent confidence of justice and all the indignation of injured virtue seem therefore entitled to equal regard The men have indeed by their superiority of writing been able to collect the evidence of many ages and raise prejudices in their favour by the venerable testimonies of philosophers historians and poets But the pleas of the ladies appeal to passions of more forcible operation than the reverence of antiquity if they have not so great names on their side they have stronger arguments it is to little purpose that Socrates or Euripides are produced against the sighs of softness and the tears of beauty The most frigid and inexorable judge would at least stand suspended between equal powers as Lucan was perplexed in the determination of the cause where the deities were on one side and Cato on the other  BUT I who have long studied the severest and most abstracted philosophy have now in the cool maturity of life arrived to such command  over my passions that I can hear the vociferations of either sex without catching any of the fire from those that utter them For I have found by long experience that a man will sometimes rage at his wife when in reality his mistress has offended him and a lady complain of the cruelty of her husband when she has no other enemy than bad cards I do not suffer myself now to be any longer imposed upon by oaths on one side or fits on the other nor when the husband hastens to the tavern and the lady retires to her closet am I always confident that they are driven to to it by their miseries since I have sometimes reason to believe that they purpose not so much to sooth their sorrows as to animate their fury But how little credit soever may be given to particular accusations the general accumulation of the charge shews with too much evidence that married persons are not very often advanced in felicity and therefore it may be proper to examine at what avenues so many evils have made their way into the world With this purpose I have reviewed the lives of my friends who have been least successful in connubial contracts and attentively considered by what motives they were incited to marry and by what principles they regulated their choice  ONE of the first of my acquaintances that resolved to quit the unsettled thoughtless condition of a batchelor was Prudentius a man of slow parts but not without knowledge or judgment in things which he had leisure to consider gradually before he determined them Whenever we met at a tavern it was his province to settle the scheme of our entertainment contract with the cook and inform us when we had called for wine to the sum originally proposed This grave considerer found by deep meditation that a man was no loser by marrying early even though he contented himself with a less fortune for estimating the exact worth of annuities he found that considering the constant diminution of the value of life with the probable fall of the interest of money it was not worse to have ten thousand pounds at the age of two and twenty years than a much larger fortune at thirty for many opportunities says he occur of improving money which if a man misses he may not afterwards recover  FULL of these reflections he threw his eyes about him not in search of beauty or elegance or dignity or understanding but of a woman  with ten thousand pounds Such a woman in a wealthy part of the kingdom it was not very difficult to find and by artful management with her father whose ambition was to make his daughter a gentlewoman my friend got her as he boasted to us in confidence two days after his marriage for a settlement of seventy three pounds a year less than her fortune might have claimed and less than he would himself have given if the fools had been but wise enough to delay the bargain  THUS at once delighted with the superiority of his parts and the augmentation of his fortune he carried Furia to his own house in which he never afterwards enjoyed one hour of happiness For Furia was a wretch of mean intellects violent passions a strong voice and low education without any sense of happiness but that which consisted in eating and counting money Furia was a scold They agreed in the desire of wealth but with this difference that Prudentius was for growing rich by gain Furia by parsimony Prudentius would venture his money with chances very much in his favour but Furia very wisely observing that what they had was while they had it  their own  thought all trassick  too great a hazard and was for putting it out at low interest upon good security Prudentius ventured however to insure a ship at a very unreasonable price but happening to lose his money was so tormented with the clamours of his wife that he never durst try a second experiment He has now grovelled seven and forty years under Furia's direction who has never mentioned him since his bad luck by any other name than that of  the insurer  THE next that married from our society was Florentius He happened to see Zephyretta in a chariot at a horserace danced with her at night was confirmed in his first ardour waited on her next morning and declared himself her lover Florentius had not knowledge enough of the world to distinguish between the flutter of coquetry and the sprightliness of wit or between the smile of allurement and that of chearfulness He was soon waked from his rapture by conviction that his pleasure was but the pleasure of a day Zephyretta had in four and twenty hours spent her stock of repartee gone round the circle of her airs and had nothing remaining for him but childish insipidity or for herself but the  practice of the same artifices upon new men by which she is every day bringing contempt upon them both  MELISSUS was a man of parts capable of enjoying and of improving life He had passed through the various scenes of gayety with that indifference and possession of himself natural to men who have something higher and nobler in their prospect Retiring to spend the summer in a village little frequented he happened to lodge in the same house with Ianthe and was unavoidably drawn to some acquaintance which her wit and politeness soon invited him to improve Having no opportunity of any other company they were always together and as they owed their pleasures to each other they began to forget that any pleasure was enjoyed before their meeting Melissus from being delighted with her company quickly began to be uneasy in her absence and being sufficiently convinced of the force of her understanding and finding as he imagined such a conformity of temper as declared them formed for each other he addressed her as a lover after no very long courtship obtained her for his wife and brought her next winter to town in triumph  Now began their inselicity Melissus had only seen her in one scene where there was no variety of objects to produce the proper excitements to contrary desires They had both loved solitude and reflection where there was nothing but solitude and reflection to be loved but when they came into publick life Ianthe discovered those passions which accident rather than hypocrisy had hitherto concealed She was indeed not without the power of thinking for that he would have detected but was wholly without the exertion of that power when either gayety or splendour played on her imagination She was expensive in her diversions vehement in her passions insatiate of pleasure however dangerous to her reputation and eager of applause by whomsoever it might be given This was the wife which Melissus the philosopher found in his retirement and from whom he expected an associate in his studies and an assistant to his virtues  PROSAPIUS upon the death of his younger brother that the family might not be extinct married his housekeeper and has ever since been complaining to his friends that mean  notions are instilled into his children that he is ashamed to sit at his own table and that his house is uneasy to him for want of suitable companions  AVARO master of a very large estate took a woman of bad reputation recommended to him by a rich uncle who made that marriage the condition on which he should be his heir Avaro now wonders to perceive his own fortune his wife's and his uncle's insufficient to give him that happiness which is to be found only with a woman of virtue  I intend to treat in more papers on this important article of life to relate the reasons which influenced not only others of my friends but some ladies whom I have known in the choice of an inseparable companion and give account of more causes which have disappointed the hope of lovers I shall therefore make no reflexion upon these histories except that all whom I have mentioned failed to obtain happiness for want of considering that marriage is the strictest tye of perpetual friendship that there can be no friendship without confidence and no confidence without integrity and that he must expect  to be wretched who pays to beauty riches or politeness that regard which only virtue and piety can claim  NUMB  TUESDAY  May    Dum te causidicum dum te modo rhetora singis  Et non decernis  Taure  quid esse velis  Peleos    Priami  transit vel  Nestoris  aetas  Et serum suerat jam tibi desinere  Eja age rumpe moras quo te spectabimus usque  Dum quid sis dubitas jam potes esse nihil  MART  IT is never without very melancholy reflexions that we can observe the misconduct or miscarriage of those men who seem by the force of understanding or extent of knowledge exempted from the general frailties of human nature and privileged from the common infelicities of life Though the world is crowded with scenes of calamity we look for the most part upon the general mass of wretchedness with very little regard and fix our eyes upon the state of particular persons whom the eminence of their qualities marks  out from the multitude as in reading an account of a battle we seldom reflect on the vulgar heaps of slaughter but follow the hero with our whole attention through all the varieties of his fortune without a thought of the thousands that are falling round him  WITH the same kind of anxious veneration I have for many years been making observations on the life of Polyfilus a man whom all his acquaintances have from his first appearance in the world feared for the quickness of his discernment and admired for the multiplicity of his attainments but whose progress in life and usefulness to mankind has perhaps been hindered by the superfluity of his knowledge and the celerity of his mind  POLYPHILUS was remarkable at the school for surpassing all his companions without any visible application and at the university was distinguished equally for his successful progress as well through the rough and thorny mazes of science as the smooth and flowery path of politer literature without any strict confinement to hours of study or any remarkable forbearance of the common amusements of young men  WHEN Polyphilus was at the age in which men usually chuse their profession and prepare to enter into a public character every academical eye was fixed upon him all were curious to inquire what this universal genius would fix upon for the employment of his life and no doubt was made but that he would leave all his contemporaries behind him and mount to the highest honours of that class in which he should inlist himself without those delays and pauses which must be always endured by meaner abilities  POLYPHILUS though by no means insolent or assuming had been sufficiently encouraged by uninterrupted success to place great confidence in his own parts and was not below his companions in the indulgence of his hopes and expectation of the astonishment with which the world would be struck when first his lustre should break out upon it nor could he forbear for whom does not constant flattery intoxicate to join sometimes in the mirth of his friends at the sudden disappearance of those who having shone awhile and drawn the eyes of the public upon their feeble radiance were now doomed to fade away before him  IT is natural for a man to catch advantageous notions of the condition which those with whom he converses are striving to attain Polyphilus in a ramble to London fell accidentally among the physicians and was so much pleased with the prospect of turning philosophy to profit and so highly delighted with a new theory of fevers which darted into his imagination and which after having considered it a few hours he found himself able to maintain against all the advocates for the ancient system that he resolved to apply himself to anatomy botany and chemistry and to leave no part unconquered either of the animal mineral or vegetable kingdoms  HE therefore read authors constructed systems and tried experiments but unhappily as he was going to see a new plant in flower at Chelsea he met in crossing Westminster to take water the chancellor's coach he had the curiosity to follow him into the hall where a remarkable cause happened to be tryed and found himself able to produce so many arguments which the lawyers had omitted on both sides that he determined to quit physic  for a profession in which he found it would be so easy to excel and which promised higher honours and larger profits without melancholy attendance upon misery mean submission to peevishness and continual interruption of rest and pleasure  HE immediately took chambers in the Temple bought a commonplacebook and confined himself for some months to the perusal of the statutes yearbooks pleadings and reports he was a constant hearer of the proceedings in the courts and began to put cases with reasonable accuracy But he soon discovered by considering the fortune of lawyers that preferment was not to be got by acuteness learning and eloquence He was perplexed by the absurdities of attorneys and misrepresentations made by his clients of their own causes by the useless anxiety of one and the incessant importunity of another he began to repent of having devoted himself to a study which was so narrow in its comprehension that it could never carry his name to any other country and thought it unworthy of a man of parts to sell his life only for money The barrenness of his fellowstudents forced him generally into other company at his hours  of entertainment and among the varieties of conversation through which his curiosity was daily wandering he by chance mingled at a tavern with some intelligent officers of the army A man of letters was easily dazzled with the gaiety of their appearance and softened into kindness by the politeness of their address he therefore cultivated this new acquaintance and when he saw how readily they found in every place admission and regard and how familiarly they mingled with every rank and order of men he began to feel his heart beat for military honours and wondered how the prejudices of the university should make him so long insensible of that ambition which has fired so many hearts in every age and negligent of that calling which is above all others universally and invariably illustrious and which gives even to the exterior appearance of its professors a dignity and freedom unknown to the rest of mankind  THESE favourable impressions were made still deeper by his conversation with ladies whose regard for soldiers he could not observe without wishing himself one of that happy fraternity to which the female world seemed to have devoted their charms and their kindness  The love of knowledge which was still his predominant inclination was gratified by the recital of adventures and accounts of foreign countries and therefore he thought there was no way of life in which all his views could so compleatly concenter as in that of a soldier In the art of war he thought it not difficult to excel having observed his new friends not very much versed in the principles of tacticks or fortification and therefore he studied all the military writers both antient and modern and in a short time could tell how to have gained every remarkable battle that had been lost from the beginning of the world He often shewed at table how Alexander should have been checked in his conquests what was the fatal error at Pharsalia how Charles of Sweden might have escaped his ruin at Pultowa and Marlborough might have been made to repent his temerity at Blenheim He entrenched armies upon paper so that no superiority of numbers could force them and modelled in clay many impregnable fortresses on which all the present arts of attack would be exhausted without effect  POLYPHILUS in a short time obtained a commission but before he could rub off the  solemnity of a scholar and gain the true air of military vivacity a war was declared and forces sent to the continent Here Polyphilus unhappily found that study alone would not make a soldier for being much accustomed to think he let the sense of danger sink into his mind and felt at the approach of any action that terror which a sentence of death would have brought upon him He saw that instead of conquering their fears the endeavour of his gay friends was only to escape them but his philosophy chained his mind to its object and rather loaded him with shackles than furnished him with arms He however suppressed his misery in silence and passed through the campaign with honour but found himself utterly unable to support another  HE then had recourse again to his books and continued to range from one study to another As I usually visit him once a month and am admitted to him without previous notice I have found him within this last half year decyphering the Chinese language making a farce collecting a vocabulary of the obsolete terms of the English law writing an inquiry concerning the ancient Corinthian  brass and forming a new scheme of the variations of the needle  THUS is this powerful genius which might have extended the sphere of any scienceor benefited the world in any profession dissipated in a boundless variety without any profit to others or himself He makes sudden irruptions into the regions of knowledge and sees all obstacles give way before him but he never stays long enough to compleat his conquest to establish laws or bring away the spoils  SUCH is often the folly of those men whom nature has enabled to obtain skill and knowledge on terms so easy that they have no sense of the value of the acquisition who are qualified to make such speedy progress in learning that they think themselves at liberty to loiter in the way and often by turning aside after every new object like Atalanta lose the race to slower competitors who press diligently forward and whose force is directed to a single point  I HAVE often thought those happy that have been fixed from the first dawn of  thought in a determination to some state of life by the choice of one whose authority may preclude caprice and whose influence may prejudice them in favour of his opinion The general precept of consulting the genius is of little use unless we are told how the genius can be known If it is to be discovered only by experiment life will be lost before the resolution can be fixed if any other indications are to be found they may perhaps be very early discerned At least if to miscarry in an attempt be a proof of having mistaken the direction of the genius men appear not less frequently deceived with regard to themselves than to others and therefore no one has much reason to complain that his life was planned out by his friends or to be confident that he should have had either more honour or happiness by being abandoned to the chance of his own fancy  IT was said of the learned bishop Sanderson that when he was preparing his lectures he hesitated so much and rejected so often that at the time of reading he was often forced to produce not what was best but what happened to be at hand This will be the state of every man who in the choice  of his employment balances all the arguments on every side the complication is so intricate the motives and objections so numerous there is so much play for the imagination and so much remains in the power of others that reason is forced at last to rest in neutrality the decision devolves into the hands of chance and after a great part of life spent in inquiries which can never be resolved the rest must often pass in repenting the unnecessary delay and can be useful to few other purposes than to warn others against the same folly and to show that of two states of life equally consistent with religion and virtue he who chuses earliest chuses best  NUMB  SATURDAY  May    Ad populum phaleras ego te intus et in cute novi  PERSIUS  AMONG the numerous stratagems by which pride endeavours to recommend folly to regard there is scarcely one that meets with less success than affectation or a perpetual disguise of the real character by fictitious appearances whether it be that every  man hates falshood from the natural congruity of truth to his faculties of reason or that every man is jealous of the honour of his understanding and thinks his discernment consequentially called in question whenever any thing is exhibited under a borrowed form  THIS aversion from all kinds of disguise whatever be its cause is universally diffused and incessantly in action nor is it necessary that to exasperate detestation or excite contempt any interest should be invaded or any competition attempted it is sufficient that there is an intention to deceive an intention which every heart swells to oppose and every tongue is busy to detect  THIS reflexion was awakened in my mind by a very common practice among my correspondents of writing under characters which they cannot support which are of no use to the explanation of that which they describe or the enforcement of that which they recommend and which therefore since they can be supposed to assume them only for the sake of displaying their abilities I will advise them for the future to forbear as laborious without advantage  IT is almost a general ambition of those who favour me with their advice for the regulation of my conduct or their contribution for the assistance of my understanding to affect the style and the names of ladies And I cannot always withold some expression of anger like Hugh in the comedy when I happen to find that a woman has a beard I must therefore warn the gentle Phyllis that she send me no more letters from the HorseGuards and require of Belinda that she be content to resign her pretention to female elegance till she has lived three weeks without hearing the politicks of Batson's coffeehouse I must indulge myself in the liberty of observing that there were some allusions in Chloris's production sufficient to shew that Bracton and Plowden are her favourite authors and that Euphelia has not been long enough at home to wear out all the traces of the phraseology which she learned in the expedition to Carthagena  AMONG all my female friends there was none who gave me more trouble to decypher her true character than Penthesilea whose letter lay upon my desk three days before I  could fix upon the real writer There was a confusion of images and medley of barbarity which held me long in suspense till by perseverance I disentangled the perplexity and found that Penthesilea is the son of a wealthy stockjobber who spends his morning under his father's eye in 'ChangeAlley dines at a tavern in CoventGarden passes his evening in the playhouse and part of the night at a gamingtable and having learned the dialect of these various regions has mingled them all in a studied composition  WHEN Lee was once told by a critic that it was very easy to write like a madman he answered that it was difficult to write like a madman but easy enough to write like a fool and I hope to be excused by my kind contributors if in imitation of this great author I presume to remind them that it is much easier not to write like a man than to write like a woman  I HAVE indeed some ingenious wellwishers who without departing from their sex have found very wonderful distinctions A very smart letter has been sent me from a puny ensign signed Ajax Telamonius another  in recommendation of a new treatise upon cards from a gamester who calls himself Sesostris and another upon the improvements of the fishery from Dioclesian but as these seem only to have picked up their appellations by chance without endeavouring at any particular imposture their improprieties are rather instances of blunder than of affectation and are therefore not equally fitted to inflame the hostile passions for it is not folly but pride not error but deceit which the world means to persecute when it raises the full cry of nature to hunt down affectation  THE hatred which dissimulation always draws upon itself is so great that if I did not know how much cunning differs from wisdom I should wonder that any men have so little knowledge of their own interest as to aspire to wear a mask for life to try to impose upon the world a character to which they feel themselves void of any just claim and to hazard their quiet their fame and even their profit by exposing themselves to the danger of that reproach malevolence and neglect which such a discovery as they have always to fear will certainly bring upon them  IT might be imagined that the pleasure of reputation should consist in the satisfaction of having our opinion of our own merit confirmed by the suffrage of the publick and that to be extolled for a quality which a man knows himself to want should give him no other happiness than to be mistaken for the owner of an estate over which he chances to be travelling But he who subsists upon affectation knows nothing of this delicacy like a desperate adventurer in commerce he takes up reputation upon trust mortgages possessions which he never had and enjoys to the fatal hour of bankrupcy though with a thousand terrors and anxieties the unnecessary splendour of borrowed riches  AFFECTATION is to be always distinguished from hypocrisy as being the art of counterfeiting those qualities which we might with innocence and safety be known to want Thus the man who to carry on any fraud or to conceal any crime pretends to rigours of devotion and exactness of life is guilty of hypocrisy and his guilt is greater as the end for which he puts on the false appearance is more pernicious But he that with an  awkward address and unpleasing countenance boasts of the conquests made by him among the ladies and counts over the thousands which he might have prossessed if he would have submitted to the yoke of matrimony is chargeable only with affectation Hypocrisy is the necessary burthen of villainy affectation part of the chosen trappings of folly the one completes a villain the other only finishes a fop Contempt is the proper punishment of affectation and detestation the just consequence of hypocrisy  WITH the hypocrite it is not at present my intention to expostulate though even he might be taught the excellency of virtue by the necessity of seeming to be virtuous but the man of affectation may perhaps be reclaimed by finding how little he is likely to gain by perpetual constraint and incessant vigilance and how much more securely he might make his way to esteem by cultivating real than displaying counterfeit qualities  EVERY thing future is to be estimated by a wise man in proportion to the probability of attaining it and its value when attained and neither of these considerations will much contribute  to the encouragement of affectation For if the pinacles of fame be at best slippery how unsteady must his footing be who stands upon pinacles without foundation If praise be made by the inconstancy and malice of those who must confer it a blessing which no man can promise himself from the most conspicuous merit and vigorous industry how faint must be the hope of gaining it when the uncertainty is multiplied by the weakness of the pretensions He that persues fame with just claims trusts his happiness to the winds but he that endeavours after it by false merit has to fear not only the violence of the storm but the leaks of his vessel Though he should happen to keep above water for a time by the help of a soft breeze and a calm sea at the first gust he must inevitably founder with this melancholy reflexion that if he would have been content with his natural station he might have escaped his calamity Affectation my possibly succeed for a time and a man may by great attention persuade others that he really has the qualities which he presumes to boast but the hour will come when he should exert them and then whatever he enjoyed in praise he must suffer in reproach  APPLAUSE and admiration are by no means to be counted among the necessaries of life and therefore any indirect arts to obtain them have very little claim to pardon or compassion There is scarcely any man without some valuable or improvable qualities by which he might always secure himself from contempt And perhaps exemption from ignominy is the most eligible reputation as freedom from pain is among some philosophers the definition of happiness  IF we therefore compare the value of the praise obtained by fictitious excellence even while the cheat is yet undiscovered with that kindness which every man may win by his virtue and that esteem which most men may gain by common understanding steadily and honestly applied we shall find that when from the adscititious happiness all the deductions are made by fear and accident there will remain nothing equiponderant to the security of truth The state of the possessor of humble virtues to the affecter of great excellencies is that of a small well built cottage of stone to the palace raised with ice by the empress of Russia it was for a time splendid and luminous but the first shunshine melted it to nothing  NUMB  TUESDAY  May    Terra salutiferas herbas eademque nocentes  Nutrit urticae proxima saepe rosa est  OVID  EVERY man is prompted by the love of himself to imagine that he possesses some peculiar qualities superior either in kind or in degree to those which he sees allotted to the rest of the world and whatever apparent disadvantages he may suffer in the comparison with others he has some invisible distinctions some latent reserve of excellence which he throws into the balance and by which he generally fancies that it is turned in his favour  THE studious and speculative part of mankind have always seemed to consider their fraternity as placed in a state of opposition to those who are engaged in the tumult of public business and have pleased themselves from age to age with celebrating the felicity of their own condition and with recounting the perplexity of politics the dangers of greatness the anxieties of ambition and the miseries of riches  AMONG the numerous topics of declamation that their industry has discovered on this subject there is none which they press with greater efforts or on which they have more copiously laid out their reason and their imagination than the instability of high stations and the uncertainty with which their profits and honours are possessed that must be acquired with so much hazard vigilance and labour  THIS they appear to consider as an irrefragable argument against the choice of the statesman and the warrior to this weapon they have always recourse in their rhetorical attacks and swell with all the confidence of victory thus furnished by the muses with the arms which never can be blunted and which no art or strength of their adversaries can elude or resist  IT was well known by experience to the nations which employed elephants in war that though by the terror of their bulk and the violence of their impression they often threw the enemy into disorder yet there was always danger in the use of them very nearly  equivalent to the advantage for if their first charge could be supported they were easily driven back upon their confederates they then broke through the troops behind them and made no less havock in the precipitation of their retreat than in the fury of their onset  I KNOW not whether those who have so vehemently urged the inconveniences and dangers of an active life have not made use of arguments that may be retorted with equal force upon themselves and whether the happiness of a candidate for literary fame be not subject to the same uncertainty with that of him who governs provinces or commands armies presides in the senate or dictates in the cabinet  THAT eminence of learning is not to be gained without labour at least equal to that which any other kind of greatness can require will scarcely be denied by those who wish to elevate the character of a scholar since they cannot but know that every human acquisition is valuable in proportion to the difficulty implied in its attainment And that those who have gained the esteem and veneration  of the world by their knowledge or their genius are by no meanes exempt from the solicitude which any other kind of dignity produces may be conjectured from the innumerable artifices which they make use of to degrade a superior to repress a rival or obstruct a follower artifices so gross and mean as to be an evident proof how easily a man may excel in learning without being either more wise or more virtuous than those whose ignorance he pities or despises  NOTHING therefore remains by which the student can gratify his desire of appearing to have built his happiness on a more firm basis than his antagonist except the certainty with which his honours are enjoyed The garlands gained by the heroes of literature must be gathered from summits equally difficult to climb with those that bear the civic or triumphal wreaths they must be worn with equal envy and guarded with equal care from those hands that are always employed in efforts to tear them away the only remaining hope is that their verdure is more lasting and that they are less likely to fade by time or less obnoxious to the blasts of accident  EVEN this hope will receive very little encouragement from the examination of the history of learning or observation of the fate of scholars in the present age If we look back into past times we find innumerable names of authors once in high reputation read perhaps by the beautiful quoted by the witty and commented by the grave but of whom we now know only that they once existed If we consider the distribution of literary fame in our own time we shall find it a possession of very uncertain tenure sometimes bestowed by a sudden caprice of the publick and again transferred to a new favourite for no other reason than that he is new sometimes refused to long labour and eminent desert and sometimes granted to very slight pretensions lost sometimes by security and negligence and sometimes by too diligent endeavours to retain it  A SUCCESSFUL author is equally in danger of the diminution of his fame whether he continues or ceases to write The regard of the publick is not to be kept but by tribute and the remembrance of past service will quickly languish unless successive performances  frequently revive it Yet in every new attempt there is new hazard and there are few who do not at some unlucky time injure their own characters by attempting to enlarge them  THERE are many possible causes of that inequality which we may so frequently observe in the performances of the same man from the influence of which no ability or industry is sufficiently secured and which have so often sullied the splendour of genius that the wit as well as the conqueror may be properly cautioned not to indulge his pride with too early triumphs but to defer to the end of life his estimate of happiness  Ultima semper  Expectanda dies homini dicique beatus  Ante obitum nemo supremaque funera debet  AMONG the motives that urge an author to undertakings by which his reputation is impaired one of the most frequent must be mentioned with tenderness because it is not to be counted among his follies but his miseries It very often happens that the works of learning or of wit are performed at the direction of those by whom they are to be rewarded the  writer has not always the choice of his subject but is compelled to accept any task which is thrown before him without much consideration of his own convenience and without time to prepare himself for the execution by previous studies  Miscarriages of this kind are likewise frequently the consequences of that acquaintance with the great which is generally considered as one of the chief privileges of literature and genius A man who has once learned to think himself exalted by familiarity with those whom nothing but their birth or their fortunes or such stations as are seldom gained by moral excellence set above him will not be long without submitting his understanding to their conduct he will suffer them to prescribe the course of his studies and employ him for their own purposes either of diversion or interest His desire of pleasing those whose favour he has weakly made necessary to himself will not suffer him always to consider how little he is qualified for the work imposed Either his vanity will tempt him to conceal his deficiences or that cowardice which always encroaches fast upon such as spend their lives in the company of persons higher than themselves  will not leave him resolution to assert the liberty of choice  BUT though we suppose that a man by his fortune can avoid the necessity of dependance and by his spirit can repel the usurpations of patronage yet he may easily by writing long happen to write ill There is a general succession of effects in which contraries are produced by periodical vicissitudes labour and care are rewarded with success success produces confidence confidence relaxes industry and negligence ruins that reputation which accuracy had raised  He that happens not to be lulled by praise into supineness may be animated by it to undertakings above his strength or incited to fancy himself alike qualified for every kind of composition and able to comply with the public taste through all its variations By some opinion like this many men have been engaged at an advanced age in attempts which they had not time to complete and after a few weak efforts sunk into the grave with vexation to see the rising generation gain ground upon them That judgment which appears so penetrating when it is employed  upon the works of others very often fails in performances where interest or passion can exert their power We are blinded in examining our own labours by innumerable prejudices Our juvenile compositions please us because they bring to our minds the remembrance of youth our later performances we are ready to esteem because we are unwilling to think that we have made no improvement what flows easily from the pen charms us because we read with pleasure that which flatters our opinion of our own powers what was composed with great struggles of the mind we are unwilling to reject because we cannot bear that so much labour should be fruitless But the reader has none of these prepossessions and wonders that the author is so unlike himself without considering that the same soil will with different culture afford different products  NUMB  SATURDAY  June    Ego nec studium sine divite venâ  Nec rude quid prosit video ingenium alterius sic  Altera poscit opem res conjurat amicé  HOR  WIT and LEARNING were the children of Apollo by different mothers WIT was the offspring of Euphrosyne and resembled her in chearfulness and vivacity LEARNING was born of Sophia and retained her seriousness and caution As their mothers were rivals they were bred up by them from their birth in habitual opposition and all means were so incessantly employed to impress upon them a hatred and contempt of each other that though Apollo who foresaw the ill effects of their discord endeavoured to soften them by dividing his regard equally between them yet his impartiality and kindness were without effect the maternal animosity was deeply rooted having been intermingled with their first ideas and was confirmed every hour as fresh opportunities occurred of exerting it No sooner were they of age to be received into the apartments of  the other celestials than WIT began to entertain Venus at her toilet by aping the solemnity of LEARNING and LEARNING to divert Minerva at her loom by exposing the blunders and ignorance of WIT  THUS they grew up with malice perpetually increasing by the encouragement which each received from those whom their mothers had persuaded to patronise and support them and each longed to be admitted to the table of Jupiter not so much for the hope of gaining honour as of excluding a rival from all pretensions to regard and of putting an everlasting stop to the progress of that influence which each believed the other obtained by mean arts and false appearances  AT last the day came when they were both with the usual solemnities received into the class of superior deities and allowed to take nectar from the hand of Hebe But from that hour Concord lost her authority at the table of Jupiter The rivals animated by their new dignity and incited by the alternate applauses of the other powers harrassed each other by incessant contests with such a regular  vicissitude of victory that neither was depressed  IT was observable that at the beginning of every debate the advantage was on the side of WIT and that at the first sallies the whole assembly sparkled according to Homer's expression with unextinguishable merriment But LEARNING would reserve her strength till the burst of applause was over and the languor with which the violence of joy is alway succeeded began to promise more calm and patient attention She then attempted her defence and by comparing one part of her antagonist's objections with another commonly made him confute himself or by shewing how small a part of the question he had taken into his view proved that his opinion could have no weight The audience began gradually to lay aside their prepossessions and rose at last with great veneration for LEARNING but with greater kindness for WIT  THEIR conduct was whenever they desired to recommend themselves to distinction entirely opposite WIT was daring and adventurous LEARNING cautious and deliberate  WIT thought nothing reproachful but dulness LEARNING was afraid of no imputation but that of error WIT answered before he understood lest his quickness of apprehension should be questioned LEARNING paused where there was no difficulty lest any insidious sophism should lie undiscovered WIT perplexed every debate by rapidity and confusion LEARNING tired the hearers with endless distinctions and prolonged the dispute without advantage by proving that which never was denied WIT in hopes of shining would venture to produce what he had not considered and often succeeded beyond his own expectation by following the train of a lucky thought LEARNING would reject every new notion for fear of being intangled in consequences which she could not foresee and was often hindered by her caution from pressing her advantages and subduing her opponent  BOTH had prejudices which in some degree hindered their progress towards perfection and left them open to attacks Novelty was the darling of WIT and antiquity of LEARNING TO WIT all that was new was specious to LEARNING whatever was antient was  venerable WIT however seldom failed to divert those whom he could not convince and to convince was not often his ambition LEARNING always supported her opinion with so many collateral truths that when the cause was decided against her her arguments were remembered with admiration  NOTHING was more common on either side than to quit their proper characters and to hope for a compleat conquest by the use of the weapons which had been employed against them WIT would sometimes labour a syllogism and LEARNING distort her features with a jest but they always suffered by the experiment and betrayed themselves to confutation or contempt The seriousness of WIT was without dignity and the merriment of LEARNING without vivacity  THEIR contests by long continuance grew at last important and the divinities broke into parties WIT was taken into the protection of the laughterloving Venus had a retinue allowed him of SMILES and JESTS and was often permitted to dance among the GRACES LEARNING still continued the favourite of Minerva and seldom went out of  her palace without a train of the severer virtues chastity temperance fortitude and labour WIT cohabiting with malice had a son named SATYR who followed him carrying a quiver filled with poisoned arrows which where they once drew blood could by no skill ever be extracted These arrows he frequently shot at LEARNING when she was most earnestly or usefully employed engaged in abstruse inquiries or giving instructions to her followers Minerva therefore deputed CRITICISM to her aid who generally broke the point of SATYR'S arrows turned them aside or retorted them on himself  JUPITER was at last angry that the peace of the heavenly regions should be in perpetual danger of violation and resolved to dismiss these troublesome antagonists to the lower world Hither therefore they came and carried on their antient quarrel among mortals nor was either long without zealous votaries WIT by his gaiety captivated the young and LEARNING by her authority influenced the old Their power quickly appeared by very eminent effects theatres were built for the reception of wit and colleges endowed for the residence of LEARNING Each party endeavoured  to outvy the other in cost and magnificence and to propagate an opinion that it was necessary from the first entrance into life to enlist in one of the factions and that none could hope for the regard of either divinity who had once entered the temple of the rival power  THERE were indeed a class of mortals by whom WIT and LEARNING were equally disregarded These were the devotees of Plutus the god of riches among these it seldom happened that the gaiety of WIT could raise a smile or the eloquence of LEARNING procure attention In revenge of this contempt they agreed to incite their followers against them but the forces that were sent on those expeditions frequently betrayed their trust and in contempt of the orders which they had received flattered the rich in public while they scorned them in their hearts and when by this treachery they had obtained the favour of Plutus very frequently affected to look with an air of superiority on those who still remained in the service of WIT and LEARNING  DISGUSTED with these desertions the two  rivals at the same time petitioned Jupiter for readmission to their native habitations Jupiter thundered on the righthand and they prepared to obey the happy summons WIT readily spread his wings and soared aloft but not being able to see far was be wildered in the pathless immensity of the ethereal spaces LEARNING who knew the way shook her pinions but for want of natural vigour could only take short flights so after many efforts they both sunk again to the ground and learned from their mutual distress the necessity of union They therefore joined their hands and renewed their flight LEARNING was borne up by the vigour of WIT and WIT guided by the perspicacity of LEARNING They soon reached the dwellings of Jupiter and were so endeared to each other that they lived afterwards in perpetual concord WIT persuaded LEARNING to converse with the GRACES and LEARNING engaged WIT in the service of the VIRTUES They were now the favourites of all the powers of heaven and gladdened every banquet by their presence They soon after married at the command of Jupiter and had a numerous progeny of ARTS and SCIENCES  NUMB  TUESDAY  June    Tres mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur  Poscentur vario multum diversa palato  HOR  THAT every man should regulate his actions by his own conscience without any regard to the opinions of the rest of the world is one of the first precepts of moral prudence justified not only by the suffrage of reason which declares that none of the gifts of heaven are to lie useless but by the voice likewise of experience which will soon inform us that if we make the praise or blame of others the rule or motive of our conduct we shall be distracted by a boundless variety of irreconcileable judgments be held in perpetual suspense between contrary impulses and consult for ever without determination  I KNOW not whether for the same reason it is not necessary for an author to place some confidence in his own skill and to satisfy himself in the knowledge that he has not deviated from the established rules of composition without submitting his works to frequent examinations before he gives them to the publick  or endeavouring to secure succses by a solicitous conformity to advice and criticism  IT is indeed quickly discoverable that consultation and compliance can conduce very little to the perfection of any literary performance for whoever is so doubtful of his own abilities as to encourage the advice and remarks of others will find himself every day embarrassed with new difficulties and will harrass his mind in vain with the hopeless labour of uniting heterogeneous ideas digesting independent hints and collecting into one point the several rays of borrowed light emitted often with contrary directions  OF all authors those who retail their labours in periodical sheets would be most unhappy if they were much to regard the censures or the admonitions of their readers for as their works are not sent into the world at once but by small parts in gradual succession it is always imagined by those who think themselves qualified to give instructions that they may yet redeem their former failings by hearkening to better judges supply by new improvements the deficiencies of their plan and make every day advances towards perfection  by the help of the criticisms which are so liberally afforded  I HAVE had occasion to observe sometimes with vexation and sometimes with merriment the different temper with which the same man reads a printed and manuscript performance When a book is once in the hands of the public it is considered as permanent and unalterable and the reader if he be free from personal prejudices takes it up with no other intention than of pleasing or instructing himself he therefore accomodates his mind to the author's design and having no interest in refusing the amusement that is offered him never interrupts his own tranqullity by studied cavils or destroys his satisfaction in that which is already well by an anxious enquiry how it might be better but is often contented without pleasure and pleased without perfection  BUT if the same man be called to consider the merit of a production yet unpublished he brings an imagination heated with objections to passages which he has yet never heard he invokes all the powers of criticism and stores his memory with Taste and Grace and Purity and  Delicacy and Manners and Unities sounds which having been once uttered by those that understood them have been since reechoed without meaning and kept up to the disturbance of the world by a constant repercussion from one coxcomb to another He considers himself as obliged to shew by some proof of his abilities that he is not consulted to no purpose and therefore watches every opening for objection and looks round for every opportunity to propose some specious alteration Such opportunities a very small degre of sagacity will enable him to find for in every work of imagination the disposition of parts the insertion of incidents and use of decorations may be varied a thousand ways with equal propriety and as in things nearly equal that will always seem best to every man which he himself produces the critic whose business is only to propose without the care of execution can never want the satisfaction of believing that he has suggested very important improvements nor the power of enforcing his advice by arguments which as they appear convincing to himself either his kindness or his vanity will press obstinately and importunately without suspicion that he may possibly judge too hastily in favour  of his own advice or inquiry whether the advantage of the new scheme be proportionate to the labour  IT is observed by the younger Pliny that an orator ought not so much to select the best and strongest arguments which his cause admits as to employ all which his imagination can afford for in pleading those reasons are of most value which will most affect the judges and the judges says he will be always most touched with that which they had before conceived Every man who is called to give his opinion of a performance decides upon the same principle he first suffers himself to form expectations and then is angry at his disappointment He lets his imagination rove at large and wonders that another equally unconfined in the boundless ocean of possibility takes a different course  BUT though the rule of Pliny be judiciously laid down it is not applicable to the writer's cause because there always lies an appeal from domestick criticism to a higher judicature and the publick which can never be corrupted nor often deceived is to pass the last sentence upon literary claims  OF the great force of preconceived opinions I had many proofs when I first entered upon this weekly labour All my readers having from the performances of my predecessors established an idea of unconnected essays to which they believed all future authors under a necessity of conforming were impatient of the least deviation from their system and numerous remonstrances were accordingly made by each as he found his favourite topicks omitted or delayed Some were angry that the RAMBLER did not like the SPECTATOR introduce himself to the acquaintance of the publick by an account of his own birth and studies an enumeration of his adventures and a description of his physiognomy Others soon began to remark that he was a solemn serious dictatorial writer without sprightliness or gaiety and called out with vehemence for mirth and humour Another admonished him to have a special eye upon the various clubs of this great city and informed him that much of the Spectator's vivacity was laid out upon such assemblies He has been likewise censured for not imitating the politeness of other writers of the same kind for having hitherto neglected to take the ladies under his  protection and to give them rules for the just opposition of colours and the proper dimensions of ruffles and pinners He has been required by another to fix a particular censure upon those matrons who play at cards with spectacles And another is very much offended whenever he meets with a speculation in which naked precepts are comprised without being enlivened by examples and characters  I MAKE not the least question that all these monitors intend the promotion of my design and the pleasure and instruction of my readers but they do not know or do not reflect that an author has a rule of choice peculiar to himself and selects those subjects which he is best qualified to treat by the course of his studies or the accidents of his life that many topicks of amusement are exhausted and are now improper because they have been already treated with too much art to invite a competition and that he who endeavours to gain many readers must try many arts of invitation essay every avenue of pleasure and make frequent changes in his methods of approach  I CANNOT but consider myself amidst this  tumult of criticism as a ship in a poetical tempest impelled at the same time by opposite winds and dashed by the waves from every quarter but held upright by the contrariety of the assailants and secured in some measure by the multiplicity of distress Had the opinion of my censurers been unanimous it might perhaps have overset my resolution but since I find them at variance with each other I can without scruple neglect them and endeavour to gain the favour of the publick by following the direction of my own reason and indulging the sallies of my own imagination  NUMB  SATURDAY  June    Nemo in sese tentat descendere  PERSIUS  AMONG the precepts or aphorisms admitted by general consent and inculcated by frequent repetition there is none more famous among the masters of antient wisdom than that compendious lesson    Be acquainted with thyself  ascribed by some to an oracle and by others to Chilo of Lacedemon  THIS is indeed a dictate which in the whole extent of its meaning may be said to comprise all the speculation requisite to a moral agent For what more can be necessary to the regulation of life than the knowledge of our original our end our duties and our relation to other beings  IT is however very improbable that the first author whoever he was intended to be understood in this unlimited and complicated sense for of the inquiries which in so large an acceptation it would seem to recommend some are too extensive for the powers of man and some require light from above which was not yet indulged to the heathen world  WE might have had more satisfaction concerning the original import of this celebrated sentence if history had informed us whether it was uttered as a general instruction to mankind or as a particular caution to some private inquirer whether it was applied to some single occasion or laid down as the universal rule of life  THERE will occur upon the slightest  consideration many possible circumstances in which this monition might very properly be inforced for every error in human conduct must arise from ignorance in ourselves either perpetual or temporary and prevail either because we do not know what is best and fittest or because knowledge is at the time of action not present to the mind  WHEN a man employs himself upon remote and unnecessary subjects and wastes his life upon questions which cannot be resolved and of which the solution would conduce very little to the advancement of happiness when he bewilders his understanding in uncertain hypotheses and harrasses his faculties with needless subtilties when he lavishes his hours in calculating the weight of the terraqueous globe or in adjusting successive systems of worlds beyond the reach of the telescope he may be very properly recalled from his excursions by this precept and reminded that there is a being with which it is his duty and his interest to be more acquainted and from which though he cannot neglect it without the utmost danger his attention has hitherto been withheld by his regard to studies which he  has no other motive to follow than such as either vanity or curiosity produce  THE great praise of Socrates is that he drew the wits of Greece by his instruction and example from the vain persuit of natural philosophy to moral inquiries and turned their thoughts from stars and tides and matter and motion upon the various modes of virtue and relations of life All his lectures were but commentaries upon this saying if we suppose the knowledge of ourselves recommended by Chilo in opposition to other inquiries less suitable to the state of man  THE great fault of men of learning is still that they offend against this rule and appear willing to study any thing rather than themselves for which reason they are too often despised by those with whom they imagine themselves above comparison despised as useless to all the common purposes of life as unable to conduct the most trivial affairs and unqualified to perform those offices by which the concatenation of society is preserved and mutual tenderness excited and maintained  GELIDUS is a man of great penetration  and deep researches Having a mind naturally formed for the abstruser sciences he can comprehend intricate combinations without confusion and being of a temper naturally cool and equal he is seldom interrupted by his passions in the persuit of the longest chain of unexpected consequences He has therefore a long time indulged hopes that the solution of some problems by which the professors of science have been hitherto baffled is reserved for his genius and industry He spends his time in the highest room of his house into which none of his family are suffered to enter and when he comes down to his dinner or his rest he walks about like a stranger that is there only for a day without any tokens of regard or tenderness He has totally divested himself of all human sensations he has neither eye for beauty nor ear for complaint he neither rejoices at the good fortune of his nearest friend nor mourns for any publick or private calamity Having once received a letter which appeared to have been sent by sea and given it his servant to read he was informed that it was written by his brother who being shipwrecked had swum naked to land and was destitute of necessaries in a foreign country Naked and destitute says Gelidus  reach down the last volume of meteorological observations extract from the letter an exact account of the wind and note it carefully in the diary of the weather  THE family of Gelidus once broke into his study to shew him that a town at a small distance was on fire and in a few moments a servant came up to tell him that the flame had caught so many houses on both sides that the inhabitants were confounded and began to think rather of escaping with their lives than saving their dwellings What you tell me says Gelidus is very probable for fire naturally acts in a circle  THUS lives this great philosopher insensible to every spectacle of distress and unmoved by the loudest call of social nature for want of considering that men are designed for the succour and comfort of each other that though there are hours which may be laudably spent upon knowledge not immediately useful yet the first attention is due to practical virtue and that he may be justly driven out from the commerce of mankind who has so far abstracted himself from the species as to partake neither of the joys nor griefs of others  but neglects the endearments of his wife and the caresses of his children to count the drops of rain note the changes of the wind and calculate the eclipses of the moons of Jupiter  I SHALL reserve to some future paper the more religious and important meanings of this epitome of wisdom and only remark at present that it may be applied to the gay and light as well as to the grave and solemn parts of life and that not only the philosopher may forfeit his pretences to real learning by neglecting this necessary study but that the wit and the beauty may miscarry in their schemes for want of this universal requisite the know ledge of themselves  IT is surely for no other reason that we see such numbers in every order of mankind resolutely struggling against nature and contending for that which they never can attain endeavouring to unite contradictions and determined to excel in characters inconsistent with each other that stockjobbers affect dress gaiety and elegance and that mathematicians labour to be wits that the soldier teazes his acquaintance with questions in theology and the academick hopes to divert the  ladies by a recital of his gallantries That absurdity of pride could proceed only from ignorance of themselves by which Garth attempted criticism and Congreve waved his title to dramatick reputation and desired to be considered only as a gentleman  EUPHUES with great parts and extensive knowledge has a clouded aspect and ungracious form yet it has been his ambition from his first entrance into life to distinguish himself by particularities in his dress to outvie beaus in embroidery to import new trimmings and to be foremost in the fashion Euphues has turned on his exterior appearance that attention which would always have produced esteem had it been fixed upon his mind and though his real virtues and acknowledged abilities have preserved him from the contempt which he has so diligently solicited he has at least raised one impediment to his reputation since all can judge of his dress but few of his understanding and many who discern that he is a fop are unwilling to believe that he can be wise or learned  THERE is one instance in which the ladies are particularly unwilling to observe the rule  of Chilo They are desirous to hide from themselves the advances of age and endeavour too frequently to supply the sprightliness and bloom of youth by artificial beauty and forced vivacity They hope still to inflame the heart by glances which have lost their fire or melt it by languor which is no longer delicate they play over the airs which pleased at a time when they were expected only to please and forget that airs ought in time to give place to virtues They continue to trifle because they could once trifle agreeably till those who shared their early pleasures are withdrawn to more serious engagements and are scarcely awakened from their dream of perpetual youth but by frequent experience of the scorn of those whom they endeavour to rival  NUMB  TUESDAY  June    Possunt quia posse videntur  VIRGIL  THERE are some vices and errors which though often fatal to those in whom they are found have yet by the universal consent of mankind been considered as entitled  to some degree of respect or have at least been exempted from contemptuous infamy and condemned by the severest moralists with pity rather than detestation  A CONSTANT and invariable example of this general partiality will be found in the different regard which has always been shown to rashness and cowardice two vices of which though they may be conceived equally distant from the middle point where true fortitude is placed and may equally injure any publick or private interest yet the one is never mentioned without some kind of veneration and the other always considered as a topick of unlimited and licentious censure on which all the virulence of reproach may be lawfully exerted  THE same distinction is made by the common suffrage between profusion and avarice and perhaps between many other opposite vices and as I have found reason to pay great regard to the voice of the people in most cases where knowledge has been forced upon them by experience without long deductions or deep researches I am inclined to believe that this distribution of respect however  unequal it may appear at first view is not without some agreement with the nature of things and that in the faults which are thus invested with extraordinary privileges there are generally some latent principles of merit some possibilities of future virtue which may by degrees break from obstruction and by time and opportunity be brought into act  IT may be laid down as an acknowledged axiom that it is more easy to take away superfluities than to supply defects and therefore he that is culpable because he has passed the middle point of virtue is always accounted a fairer object of hope than he who fails by falling short The one has all that perfection requires and more but the excess may be easily retrenched the other wants the qualities requisite to excellence and who can tell how he shall obtain them We are certain that the horse may be taught to keep pace with his fellows whose fault is that he leaves them behind We know that a few strokes of the axe will lop a cedar but what arts of cultivation can elevate a shrub  TO walk with circumspection and steadiness in the right path at an equal distance between  the extremes of error ought to be the constant endeavour of every reasonable being nor can I think those teachers of moral wisdom much to be honoured as benefactors to mankind who are always enlarging upon the difficulty of our duties and providing rather excuses for vice than incentives to virtue  BUT since to most it will happen often and to all sometimes that there will be a deviation towards one side or the other we ought always to employ our vigilance with most attention on that enemy from which there is greatest danger and to stray if we must stray towards those parts from whence it is probable that we shall quickly and easily return  AMONG other opposite qualities of the mind which may become dangerous though in different degrees I have often had occasion to consider the contrary effects of presumption and despondency of heady confidence which promises victory without contest and heartless pusillanimity which shrinks back from the thoughts of great undertakings confounds difficulty with impossibility and considers all advancement towards any new attainment as irreversibly prohibited  PRESUMPTION will be easily corrected Every experiment will teach caution and miscarriages will hourly shew that attempts are not always rewarded with success The most precipitate ardour will in time be taught the necessity of methodical gradation and preparatory measures and the most daring confidence be convinced that neither merit nor abilities can command events  IT is the advantage of vehemence and activity that they are always hastening to their own reformation because they always incite us to try whether our expectations are well grounded and therefore detect the deceits which they are apt to occasion But timidity is a disease of the mind more obstinate and fatal for he who is once persuaded that any impediment is insuperable has given it with respect to himself that strength and weight which it had not before He can scarcely strive with vigour and perseverance when he has no hope of gaining the victory and since he never will try his strength can never discover the unreasonableness of his fears  THERE is often to be found in men devoted  to literature a kind of intellectual cowardice which whoever converses much among them may observe frequently to depress the alacrity of enterprise and by consequence to retard the improvement of science They have annexed to every species of knowledge some chimerical character of terror and inhibition which they transmit without much reflection from one to another and with which they first fright themselves and then propagate the panic to their scholars and acquaintance One study is inconsistent with a lively imagination another with a solid judgment one is improper in the early parts of life another requires so much time that it is not to be attempted at an advanced age one is dry and contracts the sentiments another is diffuse and overburdens the memory one is insufferable to taste and delicacy and another wears out life in the study of words and is useless to a wise man who desires only the knowledge of things  BUT of all the bugbears by which the  Infantes barbati  boys both young and old have been hitherto frighted from digressing into new tracts of learning none has been more mischievously efficacious than an opinion that every kind of knowledge requires a peculiar genius  or mental constitution framed for the reception of some ideas and the exclusion of others and that to him whose genius is not adapted to the study which he prosecutes all labour shall be vain and fruitless vain as an endeavour to mingle oil and water or in the language of chemistry to amalgamate bodies of heterogeneous principles  THIS opinion we may reasonably suspect to have been propagated by vanity beyond the truth It is natural for those who have raised a reputation by any science to exalt themselves as endowed by heaven with peculiar powers or marked out by an extraordinary designation for their profession and to fright competitors away by representing the difficulties with which they must contend and the necessity of qualities which are supposed to be not generally conferred and which no man can know but by experience whether he enjoys  TO this discouragement it may be possibly answered that since a genius whatever it be is like fire in the flint only to be produced by collision with a proper subject it is the business of every man to try whether his faculties may not happily cooperate with his desires and  since they whose proficiency he admires knew their own force only by the event he needs but engage in the same undertaking with equal spirit and may reasonably hope for equal success  THERE is another species of false intelligence given by those who profess to shew the way to the summit of knowledge of equal tendency to depress the mind with false distrust of itself and weaken it by needless solicitude and dejection When a scholar whom they desire to animate consults them at his entrance on some new study it is common to make flattering representations of its pleasantness and facility Thus they generally attain one of two ends almost equally desirable they either incite his industry by elevating his hopes or produce a high opinion of their own abilities since they are supposed to relate only what they have found and to have proceeded with no less ease than they promise to their followers  THE student inflamed by this encouragement sets forward in the new path and proceeds a few steps with great alacrity but he soon finds asperities and intricacies of which he has  not been forewarned and imagining that none ever were so entangled or fatigued before him sinks suddenly into despair and desists as from an expedition in which fate opposes him Thus his terrors are multiplied by his hopes and he is defeated without resistance because he had no expectation of an enemy  OF these treacherous instructors the one destroys industry by declaring that industry is vain the other by representing it as needless the one cuts away the root of hope the other raises it only to be blasted The one confines his pupil to the shore by telling him that his wreck is certain the other sends him to sea without preparing him for tempests  FALSE hopes and false terrors are equally to be avoided Every man who proposes to grow eminent by learning should carry in his mind at once the difficulty of excellence and the force of industry and remember that same is not conferred but as the recompense of labour and that labour vigorously continued has not often failed of its reward  NUMB  SATURDAY  June    Ingentes dominos et clarae nomina famae  Illustrique graves nobilitate domos  Devita et longè cautus fuge contrahe vela  Et te littoribus cymba propinqua vehat  SENECA  Mr RAMBLER  IT is usual for men engaged in the same persuits to be inquisitive after the conduct and fortune of each other and therefore I suppose it will not be unpleasing to you to read an account of the various changes which have happened in part of a life devoted to literature My narrative will not exhibit any great variety of events or extraordinary revolutions but may perhaps be not less useful because I shall relate nothing which is not likely to happen to a thousand others  I WAS born heir to a very small fortune and left by my father whom I cannot remember to the care of an uncle who having no children always treated me as his son and finding in me those qualities which old men easily discover in sprightly children when they happen to love them declared that a genius like  mine should never be lost for want of cultivation He therefore placed me for the usual time at a great school and then sent me to the university with a larger allowance than my own patrimony would have afforded that I might not keep mean company but learn to become my dignity when I should be made lord chancellor which he often lamented that the increase of his infirmities was very likely to preclude him from seeing  THIS exuberance of money naturally displayed itself in gayety of appearance and wantonness of expence and introduced me to the acquaintance of those whom the same superfluity of fortune betrayed to the same licence and ostentation Young heirs who pleased themselves with a remark very frequent in their mouths that though they were sent by their fathers to the university they were not under the necessity of living by their learning  AMONG men of this class I easily obtained the reputation of a great genius and was persuaded that with such liveliness of imagination and delicacy of sentiment I should never be able to submit to the drudgery of the  law I therefore gave myself wholly to the more airy and elegant parts of learning and was often so much elated with my superiority to the youths with whom I conversed that I began to listen with great attention to those that recommended to me a wider and more conspicuous theatre and was particularly touched with an observation made by one of my friends That it was not by lingering in the university that Prior became ambassador or Addison secretary of state  THIS desire was hourly increased by the solicitation of my companions who removing one by one to London as the caprice of their relations allowed them or as their legal dismission from the hands of their guardians put it in their power never failed to send an account of the beauty and felicity of the new world and to remonstrate how much was lost by every hour's continuance in a place of retirement and constraint  My uncle in the mean time frequently harrassed me with monitory letters which I sometimes neglected to open for a week after I received them and generally read in a tavern with such comments as might shew how much  I was superior to instruction or advice I could not but wonder how a man confined to the country and unacquainted with the present system of things should imagine himself qualified to instruct a rising genius born to give laws to the age refine its taste and multiply its pleasures  THE postman however still continued to bring me new remonstrances for my uncle was very little depressed by the ridicule and reproach which he never heard But men of parts have quick resentments it was impossible to bear his usurpations for ever and I resolved once for all to make him an example to those who imagine themselves wise because they are old and to teach young men who are too tame under representation in what manner greybearded insolence ought to be treated I therefore one evening took my pen in hand and after having animated myself with a catch wrote a general answer to all his precepts with such vivacity of turn such elegance of irony and such asperity of sarcasm that I convulsed a large company with universal laughter disturbed the neighbourhood with vociserations of applause and  five days afterwards was answered that I must be content to live upon my own estate  THIS contraction of my income gave me no disturbance for a genius like mine was out of the reach of want I had friends that would be proud to open their purses at my call and prospects of such advancement as would soon reconcile my uncle whom upon mature deliberation I resolved to receive into favour without insisting on any acknowledgment of his offence when the splendour of my condition should induce him to wish for my countenance I therefore went up to London before I had shewn the alteration of my condition by any abatement of my way of living and was received by all my academical acquaintance with triumph and congratulation I was immediately introduced among the wits and men of spirit and in a short time had divested myself of all my scholar's gravity and obtained the reputation of a pretty fellow  YOU will easily believe that I had no great knowledge of the world yet I had been hindered by the general disinclination every man feels to confess poverty from telling to any  one the resolution of my uncle and for some time subsisted upon the stock of money which I had brought with me and contributed my share as before to all our entertainments But my pocket was soon emptied and I was obliged to ask my friends for a small sum This was a favour which we had often reciprocally received from one another they supposed my wants only accidental and therefore willingly supplied them In a short time I found a necessity of asking again and was again treated with the same civility but the third time they began to wonder what that old rogue my uncle could mean by sending a gentleman to town without money and when they gave me what I asked for advised me to stipulate for more regular remittances  THIS somewhat disturbed my dream of constant affluence but I was three days after completely awaked for entering the tavern where we met every evening I found the waiters remitted their complaisance and instead of contending to light me up stairs suffered me to wait for some minutes by the bar When I came to my company I found them unusually grave and formal and one of them took a hint to turn the conversation upon the  misconduct of young men and enlarged upon the folly of frequenting the company of men of fortune without being able to support the expence an observation which the rest contributed either to enforce by repetition or to illustrate by examples Only one of them tried to divert the discourse and endeavoured to direct my attention to remote questions and common topicks  A MAN guilty of poverty easily believes himself suspected I went however next morning to breakfast with him who appeared ignorant of the drift of the conversation and by a series of enquiries drawing still nearer to the point prevailed on him not perhaps much against his will to inform me that Mr  Dash  whose father was a wealthy attorney near my native place had the morning before received an account of my uncle's resentment and communicated his intelligence with the utmost industry of groveling insolence  IT was now no longer practicable to consort with my former friends unless I would be content to be used as an inferior guest who was to pay for his wine by mirth and flattery a character which if I could not escape it I  resolved to endure only among those who had never known me in the pride of plenty I therefore changed my lodgings and frequented the coffeehouses in a different region of the town where I was very quickly distinguished by several young gentlemen of high birth and large estates and began again to amuse my imagination with hopes of preferment though not quite so confidently as when I had less experience  THE first great conquest which this new scene enabled me to gain over myself was when I submitted to confess to a party who invited me to an expensive diversion that my revenues were not equal to such golden pleasures they would not suffer me however to stay behind and with great reluctance I yielded to be treated I took that opportunity of recommending myself to some office or employment which they unanimously promised to procure me by their joint interest  I HAD now entered into a state of dependence and had hopes or fears from almost every man whom I saw If it be unhappy to have one patron what is his misery who has many I was obliged to comply with a thousand  caprices to concur in a thousand follies and to countenance a thousand errors I endured innumerable mortifications if not from cruelty at least from negligence which will creep in upon the kindest and most delicate minds when they converse without the mutual awe of equal circumstances I found the spirit and vigour of liberty every moment sinking in me and a servile fear of displeasing stealing by degrees upon all my behaviour till no word or look or action was my own As the solicitude to please increased the power of pleasing grew less and I was always clouded with diffidence where it was most my interest and wish to shine  MY patrons considering me as belonging to the community and therefore not the charge of any particular person made no scruple of neglecting any opportunity of promoting me since every one thought it more properly the business of another An account of my expectations and disappointments and the succeeding vicissitudes of my life I shall give you in my following letter which will be I hope of use to shew how ill he forms his schemes who expects happiness without freedom  I am c  NUMB  TUESDAY  June    Pauperiem metuens potiore metallis  Libertate caret  HOR  Mr RAMBLER  AS it is natural for every man to think himself of importance your knowledge of the world will incline you to forgive me if I imagine your curiosity so much excited by the former part of my narration as to make you desire that I should proceed without any unnecessary arts of connection I shall therefore not keep you longer in such suspense as perhaps my performance may not compensate  IN the gay company with which I was now united I found those allurements and delights which the friendship of young men always affords there was that openness which naturally produced confidence that affability which in some measure softened dependence and that ardour of prosession which incited hope When our hearts were dilated with merriment promises were poured out with  unlimited profusion and life and fortune were but a scanty sacrifice to friendship but when the hour came at which any effort was to be made I had generally the vexation to find that my interest weighed nothing against the slightest amusement and that every petty avocation was sound a sufficient plea for continuing me in uncertainty and want Their kindness was indeed sincere when they promised they had no intention to deceive but the same juvenile warmth which kindled their benevolence gave force in the same proportion to every other passion and I was forgotten as soon as any new pleasure seized on their attention  VAGARIO told me one evening that all my perplexities should be soon at an end and desired me from that instant to throw upon him all care of my fortune for a post of considerable value was that day become vacant and he knew his interest sufficient to procure it in the morning He desired me therefore to call on him early that he might be dressed soon enough to wait on the minister before any other application should be made I came as he appointed with all the flame of gratitude and was told by his servant that  having found at his lodgings when he came home an acquaintance who was going to travel he had been persuaded to accompany him to Dover and that they had taken posthorses two hours before day  I WAS once very near to preferment by the kindness of Charinus who at my request went to beg a place which he thought me likely to fill with great reputation and in which I should have many opportunities of promoting his interest in return and he pleased himself with imagining the mutual benefits that we should confer and the advances that we should make by our united strength Away therefore he went equally warm with friendship and ambition and left me to prepare acknowledgments against his return At length he came and told me that he had met in his way a party going to breakfast in the country that the ladies importuned him too much to be refused and that having passed the morning with them he was come back to dress himself for a ball to which he was invited for the evening  I HAVE suffered several disappointments from taylors and perriwigmakers who by  neglecting to perform their work withheld my patrons from court and once failed of an establishment for life by the delay of a servant sent to a neighbouring shop to replenish a snuffbox  AT last I thought my solicitude at an end for an office fell into the gift of Hippodamus's father who being then in the country could not very speedily fill it and whose fondness would not have suffered him to refuse his son a less reasonable request Hippodamus therefore set forward with great expedition and I expected every hour an account of his success A long time I waited without any intelligence but at last received a letter from Newmarket by which I was informed that as he had heard on the road the races were begun and I knew the vehemence of his passions too well to imagine that he could refuse himself his favourite amusement  YOU will not wonder that I was at last weary of the patronage of young men especially as I found them not generally to promise much greater fidelity as they advanced in life for I observed that what they gained in steadiness they lost in benevolence and  grew colder to my interest as they became more diligent to promote their own I was convinced that their liberality was only profuseness that as chance directed they were equally generous to vice and virtue that they were warm but because they were thoughtless and counted the support of a friend only amongst other gratifications of passion  MY resolution was now to ingratiate myself with men whose reputation was established whose high stations enabled them to prefer me and whose age exempted them from sudden changes of inclination I was considered as a man of parts and therefore easily found admission to the table of Hilarius the celebrated orator renowned equally for the extent of his knowledge the elegance of his diction and the acuteness of his wit Hilarius received me with an appearance of great satisfaction produced to me all his friends and directed to me that part of his discourse in which he most endeavoured to display his imagination I had now learned my own interest enough to supply him opportunities for smart remarks and gay sallies which I never failed to ocho and applaud Thus I was gaining every hour on his affections till unfortunately when the assembly  was more splendid than usual his desire of admiration prompted him to turn his raillery upon me I bore it for some time with great submission and his success encouraged him to redouble his attacks at last my vanity prevailed over my prudence I retorted his irony with such success that Hilarius unaccustomed to resistance was disconcerted and soon found means of convincing me that his purpose was not to encourage a rival but to foster a parasite  I WAS then taken into the familiarity of Argutio a nobleman eminent for judgment and criticism He had contributed to my reputation by the praises which he had often bestowed upon my writings in which he always owned that there were proofs of a genius that might rise to high degrees of excellence when time or information had reduced its exuberance He therefore always required me to consult him before the publication of any new performance and commonly proposed innumerable alterations without sufficient attention to the general design and without any regard to my form of style or mode of imagination But these corrections he never failed to press as indispensably necessary and thought the least delay of compliance an act of rebellion  The pride of an author made this treatment insufferable and I thought any tyranny easier to be born than that which took from me the use of my understanding  MY next patron was Eutyches the statesman who was wholly engaged in publick affairs and seemed to have no ambition but to be powerful and rich I found his favour more permanent than that of the others for there was always a certain price at which it might be bought he allowed nothing to humour or to affection but was always ready to pay liberally for the service that he required His demands were indeed very often such as virtue could not easily consent to gratify but virtue is not to be consulted when men are to raise their fortunes by the favour of the great His measures were censured I wrote in his defence and was rewarded with a place of which the profits were never received by me without the pangs of remembering that they were the reward of wickedness a reward which nothing but that necessity which the consumption of my little estate in these wild persuits had brought upon me hindered me from throwing back in the face of my corruptor  AT this time my uncle died without a will and I became heir to a small fortune I had resolution to throw off the splendour which reproached me to myself and retire to an humbler state in which I am now endeavouring to recover the dignity of virtue and hope to make some reparation for my crime and follies by informing others who may be led after the same pageants that they are about to engage in a course of life in which they are to purchase by a thousand miseries the privilege of repentance  I am c EUBULUS  NUMB  SATURDAY  June    Illi mors gravis incubat  Qui notus nimis omnibus  Ignotus moritur sibi  SENECA  I HAVE endeavoured in a late essay to shew into what errors men are hourly betrayed by a mistaken opinion of their own powers and a negligent inspection of their own character But as I then confined my  observations to common occurrences and familiar scenes I think it proper to enquire how far a nearer acquaintance with ourselves is necessary to our preservation from crimes as well as follies and how much the attentive study of our own minds may contribute to secure to us the approbation of that being to whom we are accountable both for our thoughts and our actions and whose favour must finally constitute our total happiness  IF it be reasonable to estimate the difficulty of any enterprise by the frequent miscarriages of those who undertake it it may justly be concluded that it is not easy for a man to know himself for wheresoever we turn our view we shall find almost all with whom we converse so nearly as to know their sentiments indulging more favourable conceptions of their own virtue than they have been able to impress upon others and congratulating themselves upon degrees of excellence which their fondest admirers cannot allow them to have attained  THOSE representations of imaginary virtue are generally considered as arts of  hypocrisy and as snares laid for confidence and praise But I believe that this suspicion is often unjust and that those who thus propagate their own reputation only extend the fraud by which they have been themselves deceived for this failing is incident to numbers who seem to live without designs competitions or persuits it appears on occasions which promise no accession of honour or of profit and to persons from whom very little is to be hoped or feared It is indeed not easy to tell how far we may be blinded by the love of ourselves when we reflect how much a secondary passion can cloud our judgment and how few faults a man in the first raptures of love can discover in the person or conduct of his mistress  TO lay open all the sources from which error flows in upon him who contemplates his own character would require more exact knowledge of the human heart than perhaps the most acute and laborious observers have acquired And since falsehood may be diversified without end it is not unlikely that every man admits an imposture in some respect peculiar to himself as his views have been accidentally directed or his ideas particularly combined  SOME fallacies however there are more frequently insidious which it may perhaps not be useless to detect because though they are gross they may be fatal and because nothing but attention is necessary to defeat them  ONE sophism by which men persuade themselves that they have those virtues which they really want is formed by the substitution of single acts for habits A miser who once relieved a friend from the danger of a prison suffers his imagination to dwell for ever upon his own heroick generosity he yields his heart up to indignation at those who are blind to merit or insensible to misery and who can please themselves with the enjoyment of that wealth which they never permit others to partake From any censures of the world or reproaches of his conscience he has an appeal to action and to knowledge and though his whole life is a course of rapacity and avarice he concludes himself to be tender and liberal because he has once performed an act of liberality and tenderness  AS a glass which magnifies objects by the approach of one end to the eye lessens them  by the application of the other so vices are extenuated by the inversion of that fallacy by which virtues are augmented Those faults which we cannot conceal from our own notice are considered however frequent not as habitual corruptions or settled practices but as casual failures and single lapses A man who has from year to year set his country to sale either for the gratification of his ambition or resentment confesses that the heat of party now and then betrays the severest virtue to measures that cannot be seriously defended He that spends his days and nights in riot and debauchery owns that his passions oftentimes overpower his resolution But each comforts himself that his faults are not without precedent for the best and the wisest men have given way to the violence of sudden temptations  THERE are men who always confound the praise of goodness with the practice and who believe themselves mild and moderate charitable and faithful because they have exerted their eloquence in commendation of mildness fidelity and other virtues This is an error almost universal among those that converse much with dependents with such whose fear  or interest disposes them to a seeming reverence for any declamation however enthusiastick and submission to any boast however arrogant Having none to recall their attention to their lives they rate themselves by the goodness of their opinions and forget how much more easily men may shew their virtue in their talk than in their actions  THE tribe is likewise very numerous of those who regulate their lives not by the standard of religion but the measure of other men's virtue who lull their own remorse with the remembrance of crimes more atrocious than their own and seem to believe that they are not bad while another can be sound worse  FOR escaping these and a thousand other deceits many expedients have been proposed Some have recommended the frequent consultation of a wise friend admitted to intimacy and encouraged to sincerity But this appears a remedy by no means adapted to general use for in order to secure the virtue of one it presupposes more virtue in two than will generally be found In the first such a desire of rectitude and amendment as may incline him  to hear his own accusation from the mouth of him whom he esteems and by whom therefore he will always hope that his faults are not discovered and in the second such zeal and honesty as will make him content for his friend's advantage to lose his kindness  A LONG life may be passed without finding a friend in whose understanding and virtue we can equally conside and whose opinion we can value at once for its justness and sincerity A weak man however honest is not qualified to judge A man of the world however penetrating is not fit to counsel Friends are often chosen for similitude of manners and therefore each paliiates the other's sailings because they are his own Friends are tender and unwilling to give pain or they are interested and fearful to offend  THESE objections have inclined others to advise that he who would know  should consult his enemies  the  …proaches that are vented to his  for the censures that are uttered  For his great business is to know  and those malignity will discover and resent…ment will reveal But this precept may be often frustrated for it seldom  rivals or opponents are suffered to come near enough to know our conduct with so much exactness as that conscience should allow and reflect the accusation The charge of an enemy is sometimes false and commonly so mingled with falsehood that the mind takes advantage from the failure of one part to discredit the rest and never suffers any disturbance afterward from such partial reports  YET it seems that enemies have been always found by experience the most faithful monitors for adversity has ever been considered as the state in which a man most easily becomes acquainted with himself and this effect it must produce by withdrawing flatterers and dependents whose business it is to hide our weaknesses and our errors from us and by giving loose to malice and licence to reproach or at least by cutting off those pleasures which called us away from meditation on our conduct and repressing that pride which too easily persuades us that we merit whatever we enjoy  PART of these benefits it is in every man's power to procure to himself by assigning proper portions of his life to the recollection and  examination of the rest and by putting himself frequently in such a situation by retirement and abstraction as may weaken the influence of external objects By this practice he may obtain the solitude of adversity without its melancholy its instructions without its censures and its sensibility without its perturbations  The apparent necessity of setting the would at a distance from us when we are resolved to take a nearer survey of ourselves has  many from high stations to the severities of a monastick life and indeed every man deeply engaged in business if all regard to another state be not extinguished must have the conviction tho' perhaps not the resolution of Valdesso who when he solicited Charles the fifth to dismiss him being asked whether he retired upon disgust answered that he laid down his commission for no other reason but because  there ought to be some time for sober reflection between the life of a soldier and his death  THERE are certainly few conditions which do not entangle us with sublunary hopes and fears from these it is necessary to disencumber  ourselves by intervals of solitude in which we may place ourselves in his presence who views effects in their causes and actions in their motives in which we may as Chillingworth expresses it consider things as if there were no other beings in the world but God and ourselves or to use language yet more awful  may  with our  and be still  DEATH says Seneca falls heavy upon him who is too much known to others and too little to himself and Pontanus a man celebrated among the early restorers of literature thought the study of our own hearts of so much importance that he has recommended it from his tomb  Sum  Joann  Jovianus Pontanus  quem amaverunt bonae musae suspexerunt viri probi honestavent reges domini jam scis qui sim vel qui potius  ego    "I  Pontanus beloved by the powers of literature admired by men of worth and dignified by the monarchs of the world Th  knowest now who I am or more properly who I was For thee stranger I who am in darkness cannot know thee but I intreat thee to know thyself"  I HOPE every reader of this paper will consider himself as engaged to the observation of a precept which the wisdom and virtue of all ages have concurred to enforce a precept dictated by philosophers inculcated by poets and ratified by saints  NUMB  TUESDAY  June    Prudens futuri temporis exitum  Caliginosa nocto premit deus  Ridetque si mortalis ultra  Fas trepidet  HOR  THERE is nothing recommended with greater frequency among the gavepoets of antiquity than the secure possession of the present hour and the dismission of all the cares which intrude upon our quiet or hinder by importunate perturbations the enjoyment of those delights which our condition happens to set before us  THE ancient poets are indeed by no means unexceptionable teachers of morality  their precepts are to be always considered as the sallies of a genius intent rather upon giving pleasure than instruction eager to take every advantage of insinuation and provided the passions can be engaged on its side very little solicitous about the suffrage of reason  THE darkness and uncertainty through which the heathens were compelled to wander in the persuit of happiness may indeed be alleged as an excuse for many of their seducing invitations to immediate enjoyment which the moderns by whom they have been imitated have not to plead It is no wonder that such as had no promise of another state should eagerly turn their thoughts upon the improvement of that which was before them but surely those who are acquainted with the hopes and fears of eternity might think it necessary to put some restraint upon their imagination and reflect that by echoing the songs of the ancient bacchanals and transmitting the maxims of past debauchery they not only prove that they want invention but virtue and submit to the servility of imitation only to copy that of which the writer if he was to live now would often be ashamed  YET as the errors and follies of a great genius are seldom without some radiations of understanding by which meaner minds may be enlightened the incitements to pleasure are in these authors generally mingled with such reflections upon life as well deserve to be considered distinctly from the purposes for which they are produced and to be treasured up as the settled conclusions of extensive observation acute sagacity and mature experience  IT is certainly not without just reflection that on these occasions they often warn their readers against enquiries into futurity and solicitude about events which lie hid in causes yet unactive and which time has not brought forward into the view of reason For as an idle and thoughtless resignation to chance without any struggle against calamity or endeavour after advantage is below the dignity of a reasonable being in whose power providence has put a great part even of his present happiness so it shews an equal ignorance of our proper sphere to harrass our thoughts with conjectures about things not yet in being How can we regulate events of which we  yet know not whether they will ever happen And why should we think with painful anxiety about that on which our thoughts can have no influence  IT is a maxim commonly received that a wise man is never surprised and perhaps this exemption from astonishment may be imagined to proceed from such a prospect into futurity as gave previous intimation of those evils which often fall unexpected upon others that have less foresight But the truth is that things to come except when they approach very nearly are equally hidden from men of all degrees of understanding and if a wise man is not amazed at sudden occurrences it is not that he has thought more but less upon futurity He never considered things not yet existing as the proper objects of his attention he never indulged dreams till he was deceived by their phantoms nor ever realized nonentities to his mind He is not surprised because he is not disappointed and he escapes disappointment because he never forms any expectations  THE concern about things to come that is to justly censured is not the result of those general  reflections on the variableness of fortune the uncertainty of life and the universal insecurity of all human acquisitions which must always be suggested by the view of the world but such a desponding anticipation of misfortune as fixes the mind upon scenes of gloom and melancholy and makes fear predominate in every imagination  ANXIETY of this kind is nearly of the same nature with jealousy in love and suspicion in the general commerce of life a temper which keeps the man always in alarms disposes him to judge of every thing in a manner that least favours his own quiet fills him with perpetual stratagems of counteraction wears him out in schemes to obviate evils which never threatened him and at length perhaps contributes to the production of those mischiefs of which it had raised such dreadful apprehensions  IT has been usual in all ages for moralists to repress the swellings of vain hope by representations of the innumerable casualties to which life is subject and by instances of the unexpected defeat of the wisest schemes of policy and sudden subversions of the highest eminences  of greatness It has perhaps not been equally observed that all these examples afford the proper antidote to fear as well as to hope and may be applied with no less efficacy as consolations to the timorous than as restraints to the proud  EVIL is uncertain in the same degree as good and for the reason that we ought not to hope too securely we ought not to fear with too much dejection The state of the world is continually changing and none can tell the result of the next vicissitude Whatever is afloat in the stream of time may when it is very near us be driven away by an accidental blast which shall happen to cross the general course of the current The sudden accidents by which the powerful are depressed may fall upon those whose malice we fear and the greatness by which we expect to be overborn may become another proof of the false flatteries of fortune Our enemies may become weaker or we grow strong before our encounter or we may advance against each other without ever meeting There are indeed natural evils which we can flatter ourselves with no hopes of escaping and with little of delaying but of the ills which are  apprehended from human malignity or the opposition of rival interests we may always alleviate the terror by considering that our persecutors are weak and ignorant and mortal like ourselves The misfortunes which arise from the concurrence of unhappy circumstances should never be suffered to disturb us before they happen because if the breast be once laid open to the dread of mere possibilities of misery life must be given a prey to dismal solicitude and quiet must be lost for ever  IT is remarked by old Cornaro that it is absurd to be afraid of the natural dissolution of the body because it must certainly happen and can by no caution or artifice be avoided Whether this sentiment be entirely just I shall not examine but certainly if it be improper to fear events which must happen it is yet more evidently contrary to right reason to fear those which may never happen and which if they should come upon us we cannot resist  AS we ought not to give way to fear any more than indulgence to hope because the objects both of fear and hope are yet uncertain so we ought not to trust the representations of one more than of the other because  they are both equally fallacious as hope enlarges happiness fear aggravates calamity It is generally allowed that no man ever found the happiness of possession proportionate to that expectation which incited his desire and invigorated his persuit nor has any man found the evils of life so formidable in reality as they were described to him by his own imagination every species of distress brings with it some peculiar supports some unforeseen means of resisting or power of enduring For this reason Taylor justly blames some pious persons who indulged their own fancies too much set themselves by the force of imagination in the place of the ancient martyrs and confessors and question the validity of their own faith because they shrink at the thoughts of flames and tortures It is says he sufficient that you are able to encounter the temptations which now assault you when God sends trials he may send strength  ALL fear is in itself painful and when it conduces not to safety is painful without use Every consideration therefore by which groundless terrors may be removed adds something to human happiness It is likewise not unworthy of remark that in proportion as  our cares are imployed upon the future they are abstracted from the present from the only time which we can call our own and of which if we neglect the apparent duties to make vain provision against visionary attacks we shall certainly counteract our own purpose for he doubtless mistakes his true interest who thinks that he can increase his safety when he impairs his virtue  NUMB  SATURDAY  June    Vultus ubi tuus  Assulsit populo gratior it dies  Et soles melius nitent  HOR  Mr RAMBLER  THERE are few tasks more ungrateful than for persons of modesty to speak their own praises In some cases however this must be done for the general good and a generous spirit will on such occasions assert its merit and vindicate itself with becoming warmth  My circumstances sir are very hard and peculiar Could the world be brought to treat me as I deserve it would be a publick benefit This makes me apply to you that my case being fairly stated in a paper so generally esteemed I may suffer no longer from ignorant and childish prejudices  MY elder brother was a Jew A very respectable person but somewhat austere in his manner highly and deservedly valued by his near relations and intimates but utterly unfit for mixing in a larger society or gaining a general acquaintance among mankind In a venerable old age he retired from the world and I in the bloom of youth came into it succeeding him in all his dignities and formed as I might reasonably flatter myself to be the object of universal love and esteem Joy and gladness were born with me chearfulness good humour and benevolence always attended and endeared my infancy That time is long past So long that idle imaginations are apt to fancy me wrinkled old and disagreeable but unless my lookingglass deceives me I have not yet lost one charm one beauty of my earliest years However thus far is too certain I  am to every body just what they chuse to think me so that to very few I appear in my right shape and though naturally I am the friend of humankind to few very few comparatively am I useful or agreeable  THIS is the more grievous as it is utterly impossible for me to avoid being in all sorts of places and companies and I am therefore liable to meet with perpetual affronts and injuries Though I have as natural an antipathy to cards and dice as some people have to a cat many and many an assembly am I forced to endure and though rest and composure are my peculiar joy am worn out and harrassed to death with journies by men and women of quality who never take one but when I can be of the party Some on a contrary extreme will never receive me but in bed where they spend at least half of the time I have to stay with them and others are so monstrously illbred as to take physick on purpose when they have reason to expect me Those who keep upon terms of more politeness with me are generally so cold and constrained in their behaviour that I cannot but perceive myself an unwelcome guest and even among persons deserving of esteem and who certainly have  a value for me it is too evident that generally whenever I come I throw a dulness over the whole company that I am entertained with a formal stiff civility and that they are glad when I am fairly gone  HOW bitter must this kind of reception be to one formed to inspire delight admiration and love To one capable of answering and rewarding the greatest warmth and delicacy of sentiments  I WAS bred up among a set of excellent people who affectionately loved me and treated me with the utmost honour and respect It would be tedious to relate the variety of my adventures and strange vicissitudes of my fortune in many different countries Here in  England  there was a time when I lived according to my heart's desire Whenever I appeared publick assemblies appointed for my reception were crowded with persons of quality and fashion early drest as for a court to pay me their devoirs Chearful hospitality every where crowned my board and I was looked upon in every country parish as a kind of social bond between the 'squire' the parson and the tenants The laborious  poor every where blest my appearance they do so still and keep their best clothes to do me honour though as much as I delight in the honest country folks they do now and then throw a pot of ale at my head and sometimes an unlucky boy will drive his cricketball full in my face  EVEN in these my best days there were persons who thought me too demure and grave I must forsooth by all means be instructed by foreign masters and taught to dance and play This method of education was so contrary to my genius formed for much nobler entertainments that it did not succeed at all  I FELL next into the hands of a very different set They were so excessively scandalized at the gayety of my appearance as not only to despoil me of the foreign fopperies the paint and the patches that I had been tricked out with by my last misjudging tutors but they robbed me of every innocent ornament I had from my infancy been used to gather in the fields and gardens nay they blacked my face and covered me all over with a habit of mourning and that too very coarse and aukward I was now obliged to  spend my whole life in hearing sermons nor permitted so much as to smile upon any occasion  IN this melancholy disguise I became a perfect bugbear to all children and young folks Wherever I came there was a general hush an immediate stop to all pleasantness of look or discourse and not being permitted to talk with them in my own language at that time they took such a disgust to me in those tedious hours of yawning that having transmitted it to their children I cannot now be heard though 'tis long since I have recovered my natural form and pleasing tone of voice Would they but receive my visits kindly and listen to what I could tell themlet me say it without vanityhow charming a companion should I be to every one could I talk on the subjects most interesting and most pleasing With the great and ambitious I would discourse of honours and advancements of distinctions to which the whole world should be witness of unenvied dignities and durable preferments To the rich I would tell of inexhaustible treasures and the sure method to attain them I would teach them to put out their money on the best interest and instruct  the lovers of pleasure how to secure and improve it to the highest degree The beauty should learn of me how to preserve an everlasting bloom To the afflicted I would administer comfort and relaxation to the busy  AS I dare promise myself you will attest the truth of all I have advanced there is no doubt but many will be desirous of improving their acquaintance with me and that I may not be thought too difficult I will tell you in short how I wish to be received  YOU must know I equally hate lazy idleness and hurry I would every where be welcomed at a tolerably early hour with decent goodhumour and gratitude I must be attended in the great halls peculiarly appropriated to me with respect but I do not insist upon finery propriety of appearance and perfect neatness is all I require I must at dinner be treated with a temperate but a chearful social meal both the neighbours and the poor should be the better for me Some time I must have tete a tete with my kind entertainers and the rest of my visit should be spent in pleasant walks and airings among sets of agreeable  people in such discourse as I shall naturally dictate or in reading some few selected out of those numberless books that are dedicated to me and go by my name A name that alas as the world stands at present makes them oftener thrown aside than taken up As those conversations and books should be both well chosen to give some advice on that head may possibly furnish you with a future paper and any thing you shall offer on my behalf will be of great service to  Good Mr RAMBLER  Your Faithful Friend and Servant SUNDAY  NUMB  TUESDAY  July    Non ego mendosos ausim defendere mores  Falsaque pro vitiis arma tenere meis  OVID  THOUGH the fallibility of man's reason and the narrowness of his knowledge are very generally and liberally confessed yet if an enquiry be made into the conduct of those who so willingly admit the weakness of human nature there will appear some reason for imagining that this acknowledgment is not altogether sincere at least that most make it with a tacit reserve in favour of themselves and that with whatever ease they give up the  claims of their neighbours they are desirous of being thought exempt from faults in their own conduct and from error in their opinions  THE certain and obstinate opposition which we may observe made to confutation however clear and to reproof however tender is an undoubted argument that some dormant privilege is thought to be attacked for as no man can lose what he neither possesses nor imagines himself to possess nor be defrauded of that to which he has no right it is reasonable to suppose that those who break out into fury at the first attacks of contradiction or the slightest touches of censure since they apparently conclude themselves injured must fancy their honour impaired some antient immunity violated or some natural prerogative invaded to be mistaken if they thought themselves liable to mistake could not be considered by them as either shameful or wonderful and they would not surely receive with so much emotion intelligence which only informed them of that which they knew before nor struggle with so much earnestness against an attack that deprived them of nothing to which they held themselves entitled  IT is related of one of the philosophers that when an account was brought him of his son's death he received it only with this reflection  I knew that my son was mortal  He that is convinced of an error if he had the same knowledge of his own weakness would instead of kindling with resentment straining for artifices and brooding malignity only regard such oversights as the appendages of humanity and pacify himself with considering that he had always known man to be a fallible being  IF it be true that most of our passions are excited by the novelty of objects there is little reason for doubting that to be considered as subject to fallacies of ratiocination or imperfection of knowledge is to a very great part of mankind entirely new for it is impossible to enter any place of general resort or fall into any company where there is not some regular and established subordination without finding rage and vehemence produced only by difference of sentiments about things very trifling in which neither of the disputants have any other interest than what proceeds from their mutual unwillingness to give way to any opinion  that may bring upon them the disgrace of being wrong  I HAVE heard of men that having advanced some erroneous doctrines in philosophy have refused to see the experiments by which they were confuted and the observation of every day will give new proofs with how much industry subterfuges and evasions are sought to decline the pressure of resistless arguments how often the state of the question is altered how often the antagonist is wilfully misrepresented and in how much perplexity the clearest positions are involved by those whom they happen to obstruct in the extension or propagation of a pleasing hypothesis  OF all mortals none seem to have been more infected with this species of vanity than the race of writers whose reputation arising solely from their understanding has given them a very delicate sensibility of any violence attempted on their literary honour It is not unpleasing to remark with what solicitude men of acknowledged abilities will endeavour to palliate absurdities and reconcile contradictions only to obviate criticisms to which all human performances must ever be exposed and from  which they can never suffer but when they teach the world by a vain and ridiculous impatience to think them of importance  DRYDEN whose warmth of fancy and haste of composition very frequently hurried him into inaccuracres heard himself sometimes exposed to ridicule for having said in one of his tragedies  I follow fate which does too fast persue  That no man could at once follow and be followed was it may be thought too plain to be long disputed and the truth is that DRYDEN was apparently betrayed into the blunder by the double meaning of the word FATE to which in the former part of the verse he had annexed the idea of FORTUNE and in the latter that of DEATH so that the sense only was  though persued by  DEATH  I will not resign myself to despair but will follow  FORTUNE  and do and suffer what is appointed  This however was not completely expressed and DRYDEN being determined not to give way to his critics never confessed that he had been surprised by an ambiguity but finding luckily in  Virgil  an account of a man moving in a circle with this expression  Et se sequiturque fugitque  "Here says he is the passage in  imitation of which I wrote the line that my critics were pleased to condemn as nonsense not but I may sometimes write nonsense though they have not the fortune to find it"  EVERY one sees the folly of such mean doublings to escape the persuit of criticism nor is there a single reader of this poet who would not have paid him greater veneration had he shewn consciousness enough of his own superiority to set such cavils at defiance and owned that he sometimes slipped into errors by the tumult of his imagination and the multitude of his ideas  IT is however happy when this temper discovers itself only in little things which may be right or wrong without any influence on the virtue or happiness of mankind We may with very little inquietude see a man persist in a project which he has found to be impracticable live in an inconvenient house because it was contrived by himself or wear a coat of a particular cut in hopes by perseverance to bring it into fashion These are indeed follies but they are only follies and however  wild or ridiculous can very little affect others  BUT such pride once indulged too frequently operates upon more important objects and inclines men not only to vindicate their errors but their vices to persist in practices which their own hearts condemn only lest they should seem to feel reproaches or be made wiser by the advice of others or to search for sophisms tending to the confusion of all principles and the evacuation of all duties that they may not appear to act what they are not able to defend  LET every man who finds vanity so far predominant as to betray him to the danger of this last degree of corruption pause a moment to consider what will be the consequences of the plea which he is about to offer for a practice to which he knows himself not led at first by reason but to which he was impelled by the violence of desire surprized by the suddenness of passion or seduced by the soft approaches of temptation and by imperceptible gradations of guilt Let him consider what he is going to commit by forcing his understanding to patronise  those appetites which it is its chief business to hinder and reform  THE cause of virtue requires so little art to defend it and good and evil when they have been once shewn are so easily distinguished that such apologists seldom gain proselytes to their party nor have their fallacies power to deceives any but those whose desires have clouded their discernment All that the best faculties thus employed can perform is to persuade the hearers that the man is hopeless whom they only thought vitious that corruption has passed from his manners to his principles that all endeavours for his recovery are without prospect of success and that nothing remains but to avoid him as infectious or hunt him down as destructive  BUT if it be supposed that he may impose on his audience by partial representations of consequences intricate deductions of remote causes or perplexed combinations of ideas which having various relations appear different as viewed on different sides that he may sometimes puzzle the weak and wellmeaning and now and then seduce by the admiration of his abilities a young mind still fluctuating  in unsettled notions and neither fortified by instruction nor enlightened by experience yet what must be the event of such a triumph A man cannot spend all this life in frolick age or disease or solitude will bring some hours of serious consideration and it will then afford no comfort to think that he has extended the dominion of vice that he has loaded himself with the crimes of others and can never know the extent of his own wickedness or make reparation for the mischief that he has caused There is not perhaps in all the stories of ideal anguish a thought more painful than the consciousness of having propagated corruption by vitiating principles of having not only drawn others from the paths of virtue but blocked up the way by which they should return of having blinded them to every beauty but the paint of pleasure and deafened them to every call but the alluring voice of the syrens of destruction  THERE is yet another danger in this practice men who cannot deceive others are very often successful in deceiving themselves they weave their sophistry till their own reason is entangled and repeat their positions till they are credited by themselves by often contending  they grow sincere in the cause and by long wishing for demonstrative arguments they at last bring themselves to fancy that they have found them They are then at the uttermost verge of wickedness and may die without having that light rekindled in their minds which their own pride and contumacy have extinguished  THE men who can be charged with fewest failings either with respect to abilities or virtue are generally most ready to allow them for not to dwell on things of solemn and awful consideration the humility of confessors the tears of saints and the dying terrors of persons eminent for piety and innocence it is well known that Caesar wrote an account of the errors committed by him in his wars of Gaul and that Hippocrates a name perhaps in rational estimation greater than Caesar's warned posterity against a mistake into which he had fallen  So much  says Celsus  does the open and artless confession of an error become a man conscious that he has enough remaining to support his character  AS all error is meanness it is incumbent on every man who consults his own dignity to  retract it as soon as he discovers it without fearing any censure so much as that of his own mind As justice requires that all injuries should be repaired it is the duty of him who has seduced others by bad practices or false notions to endeavour that such as have adopted his errors should know his retraction and that those who have learned vice by his example should by his example be taught amendment  NUMB  SATURDAY  July    PYTHAS  SO large a part of human life passes in a state contrary to our natural desires that one of the principal topics of moral instruction is the art of bearing calamities And such is the certainty of evil that it is the duty of every man to furnish his mind with those principles that may enable him to act under it with decency and propriety  THE sect of antient philosophers that boasted to have carried this necessary science to  the highest perfection were the stoics or scholars of Zeno whose wild enthusiastick virtue pretended to an exemption from the sensibilities of unenlightened mortals and who proclaimed themselves exalted by the doctrines of their sect above the reach of those miseries which embitter life to the rest of the world They therefore removed pain poverty loss of friends exile and violent death from the catalogue of evils and passed in their haughty stile a kind of irreversible decree by which they forbad them to be counted any longer among the objects of terror or anxiety or to give any disturbance to the tranquillity of a wise man  THIS edict indeed was I think not universally observed for though one of the more resolute when he was tortured by a violent disease cried out that let pain harrass him to its utmost power it should never force him to retract the doctrines of his sect or to consider it as other than indifferent and neutral yet all had not stubbornness to hold out against their senses for one of  Zeno  's pupils is recorded to have confessed in the anguish of the gout that  he now found pain to be an evil  IT may however be questioned whether these philosophers can be very properly numbered among the teachers of patience for if pain be not an evil there seems no instruction requisite how it may be born and therefore when they endeavour to arm their followers with arguments against it they may be thought to have given up their first position But such inconsistencies are to be expected from the greatest understandings when they endeavour to grow eminent by singularity and employ their strength in establishing opinions opposite to nature  THE controversy about the reality of external evils is now at an end That life has many miseries and that those miseries are sometimes at least equal to all the powers of fortitude which can be raised against them is now universally confessed and therefore it is useful to consider not only how we may escape them but by what means those which either the accidents of affairs or the infirmities of nature must bring upon us may be mitigated and lightened and how we may make those hours less wretched which the condition of our present existence will not allow to be very happy  THE cure for the greatest part of human miseries is not radical but palliative Infelicity is involved in corporeal nature and interwoven with our being all attempts therefore to decline it wholly are useless and vain the armies of pain send their arrows against us on every side the choice is only between those which are more or less sharp or tinged with poison of greater or less malignity and the strongest armour which reason can supply will only blunt their points but cannot repel them  THE great remedy which heaven has put in our hands is patience by which though we cannot lessen the torments of the body we can in a great measure preserve the peace of the mind and shall suffer only the natural and genuine force of an evil without heightening its acrimony or prolonging its effects  THERE is indeed nothing more unsuitable to the nature of man in any calamity than rage and turbulence which without examining whether they are not sometimes impious are at least always offensive and incline others rather to hate and despise than to pity and assist  us If what we suffer has been brought upon us by ourselves it is observed by an antient poet that patience is eminently our duty since no one should be angry at feeling that which he has deserved  Leniter ex merito quicquid patiare ferendum est  And surely if we are not conscious that we have contributed to our own sufferings if punishment fall upon innocence or disappointment happens to industry and prudence patience whether more necessary or not is much easier since our pain is then without aggravation and we have not the bitterness of remorse to add to the asperity of misfortune  IN those evils which are allotted to us by providence such as deformity privation of any of the senses or old age it is always to be remembred that impatience can have no present effect but to deprive us of the consolations which our condition admits by driving away from us those by whose conversation or advice we might be amused or helped and that with regard to futurity it is yet less to be justified since without lessening the pain it cuts off the hope of that reward which he by  whom it is inflicted will confer upon them that bear it well  IN all evils which admit a remedy impatience is to be avoided because it wastes that time and attention in complaints that if properly applied might remove the cause Turenne among the acknowledgements which he used to pay in conversation to the memory of those by whom he had been instructed in the art of war mentioned one with honour who taught him not to spend his time in regretting any mistake which he had made but to set himself immediately and vigorously to repair it  PATIENCE and submission are very carefully to be distinguished from cowardice and indolence We are not to repine but we may lawfully struggle for the calamities of life like the necessities of nature are calls to labour and exercises of diligence When we feel any pressure of distress we are not to conclude that we can only obey the will of heaven by languishing under it any more than when we perceive the pain of thirst we are to imagine that water is prohibited Of misfortune it never can be certainly known whether as proceeding from the hand of GOD it is an act  of favour or of punishment but since all the ordinary dispensations of providence are to be interpreted according to the general analogy of things we may conclude that we have a right to remove one inconvenience as well as another that we are only to take care lest we purchase ease with guilt and that our maker's purpose whether of reward or severity will be answered by the labours which he lays us under the necessity of performing  THIS duty is not more difficult in any state than in diseases intensely painful which may indeed admit of such exacerbations as seem to strain the powers of life to their utmost stretch and leave very little of the attention vacant to precept or reproof In this state the nature of man requires some indulgence and every extravagance but impiety may be easily forgiven him Yet lest we should think ourselves too soon entitled to the mournful privileges of irresistible misery it is proper to reflect that the utmost anguish which human wit can contrive or human malice can inflict has been born with constancy and that if the pains of disease be as I believe they are sometimes greater than those of artificial torture they are therefore in their  own nature shorter the vital frame is quickly broken the union between soul and body is for a time suspended and we soon cease to feel our maladies when they once become too violent to be born I think there is some reason for questioning whether the body and mind are not so proportioned that the one can bear all which can be inflicted on the other whether virtue cannot stand its ground as long as life and whether a soul well principled will not be separated sooner than subdued  In calamities which operate chiefly on our passions such as diminution of fortune loss of friends or declension of character the chief danger of impatience is upon the first attack and many expedients have been contrived by which the blow may be broken Of these the most general precept is not to take pleasure in any thing of which it is not in our power to secure the possession to ourselvesThis counsel when we consider the enjoyment of any terrestrial advantage as opposite to a constant and habitual solicitude for future felicity is undoubtedly just and delivered by that authority which cannot be disputed but in any other sense is it not like advice not to walk lest we should stumble or not to see  lest our eyes should light upon deformity It seems to me reasonable to enjoy blessings with confidence as well as to lose them with submission and to hope for the continuance of good which we possess without insolence or voluptuousness as for the restitution of that which we lose without despondency or murmurs  The chief security against the fruitless anguish of impatience must arise from the frequent reflection on the wisdom and goodness of the GOD of nature in whose hands are riches and poverty honour and disgrace pleasure and pain and life and death A settled conviction of the tendency of every thing to our good and of the possibility of turning miseries into happiness by receiving them rightly will incline us to bless the name of the Lord whether he gives or takes away  NUMB  TUESDAY  July    Quod carct alternd Requie durabile non est  OVID  IN the early ages of the world as is well known to those who are versed in antient traditions when innocence was yet untainted and simplicity unadulterated mankind was happy in the enjoyment of continual pleasure and constant plenty under the protection of REST a gentle divinity who required of her worshippers neither altars nor sacrifices and whose rites were only performed by prostrations upon tufts of flowers in shades of jasmine and myrtle or by dances on the banks of rivers flowing with milk and nectar  UNDER this easy government the first generations breathed the fragrance of perpetual spring eat the fruits which without culture fell ripe into their hands and slept under bowers arched by nature with the birds singing over their heads and the beasts sporting about them But by degrees they began to lose their original integrity each though  there was more than enough for all was desirous of appropriating part to himself Then entered violence and fraud and theft and rapine Soon after pride and envy broke into the world and brought with them a new standard of wealth for men who till then thought themselves rich when they wanted nothing now rated their demands not by the calls of nature but by the plenty of others and began to consider themselves as poor when they beheld their own possessions exceeded by those of their neighbours Now only one could be happy because only one could have most and that one was always in danger lest the same arts by which he had supplanted others should be practised upon himself  AMIDST the prevalence of this corruption the state of the earth was changed the year was divided into seasons part of the ground became barren and the rest yielded only berries acorns and herbs The summer and autumn indeed furnished a coarse and inelegant sufficiency but winter was without any relief FAMINE with a thousand diseases which the inclemency of the air invited into the upper regions made havock among men and there  appeared to be danger lest they should be destroyed before they were reformed  TO oppose the devastations of FAMINE who scattered the ground every where with carcases LABOUR came down upon earth LABOUR was the son of NECESSITY the nurseling of HOPE and the pupil of ART he had the strength of his mother the spirit of his nurse and the dexterity of his governess His face was wrinkled with the wind and swarthy with the sun he had the implements of husbandry in one hand with which he turned up the earth in the other he had the tools of architecture and raised walls and towers at his pleasure He called out with a rough voice "Mortals see here the power to whom you are consigned and from whom you are to hope for all your pleasures and all your safety You have long languished under the dominion of REST an impotent and deceitful goddess who can neither protect nor relieve you but resigns you to the first attacks of either FAMINE or DISEASE and suffers her shades to be invaded by every enemy and destroyed by every accident"  "AWAKE therefore to the call of LABOUR  I will teach you to remedy the sterility of the earth and the severity of the sky I will compel summer to find provisions for the winter I will force the waters to give you their fish the air its fowls and the forest its beasts I will teach you to pierce the bowels of the earth and bring out from the caverns of the mountains metals which shall give strength to your hands and security to your bodies by which you may be covered from the assaults of the fiercest beasts and with which you shall fell the oak and divide rocks and subject all nature to your use and pleasure"  ENCOURAGED by this magnificent invitation the inhabitants of the globe considered LABOUR as their only friend and hasted to his command He led them out to the fields and mountains and shewed them how to open mines to level hills to drain marshes and change the course of rivers The face of things was immediately transformed the land was covered with towns and villages encompassed with fields of corn and plantations of fruittrees and nothing was seen but heaps of grain and baskets of fruit full tables and crouded storehouses  THUS LABOUR and his followers added every hour new acquisitions to their conquests and saw FAMINE gradually dispossessed of his dominions till at last amidst their jollity and triumphs they were depressed and amazed by the approach of LASSITUDE who was known by her sunk eyes and dejected countenance She came forward trembling and groaning at every groan the hearts of all those that beheld her lost their courage their nerves slackened their hands shook and the instruments of labour fell from their grasp  SHOCKED with this horrid phantom they reflected with regret on their easy compliance with the solicitations of LABOUR and began to wish again for the golden hours which they remembered to have passed under the reign of REST whom they resolved again to visit and to whom they intended to dedicate the remaining part of their lives REST had not left the world they quickly found her and to atone for their former desertion invited her to the enjoyment of those acquisitions which LABOUR had procured them  REST therefore took leave of the groves and  vallies which she had hitherto inhabited and entered into palaces reposed herself in alcoves and slumbered away the winter upon beds of down and the summer in artificial grottos with cascades playing before her There was indeed always something wanting to complete her felicity and she could never lull her returning fugitives to that serenity which they knew before their engagements with LABOUR Nor was her dominion entirely without controul for she was obliged to share it with LUXURY though she always looked upon her as a false friend by whom her influence was in reality destroyed while it seemed to be promoted  THE two soft associates however reigned for some time without visible disagreement till at last LUXURY betrayed her charge and let in DISEASE to seize upon her worshippers REST then flew away and left the place to the usurpers who employed all their arts to fortify themselves in their possession and to strengthen the interest of each other  REST had not always the same enemy in some places she escaped the incursions of DISEASE but had her residence invaded by a  more slow and subtle intruder for very frequently when every thing was composed and quiet when there was neither pain within nor danger without when every flower was in bloom and every gale freighted with perfumes SATIETY would enter with a languishing and repining look and throw herself upon the couch placed and adorned for the accommodation of REST No sooner was she seated than a general gloom spread itself on every side the groves immediately lost their verdure and their inhabitants desisted from their melody the breeze sunk in sighs and the flowers contracted their leaves and shut up their odours Nothing was seen on every side but multitudes wandering about they knew not whither in quest they knew not of what no voice was heard but of complaints that mentioned no pain and murmurs that could tell of no misfortune  REST had now lost her authority Her followers again began to treat her with contempt some of them united themselves more closely to LUXURY who promised by her arts to drive SATIETY away and others that were more wise or had more fortitude went back again to LABOUR by whom they were  indeed protected from SATIETY but delivered up in time to LASSITUDE and forced by her to the bowers of REST  THUS REST and LABOUR equally perceived their reign of short duration and uncertain tenure and their empire liable to inrodes from those who were alike enemies to both They each sound their subjects unfaithful and ready to desert them upon every opportunity LABOUR saw the riches which he had given always carried away as an offering to REST and REST found her votaries in every exigence flying from her to beg help of LABOUR They therefore at last determined upon an interview in which they agreed to divide the world between them and govern it alternately allotting the dominion of the day to one and that of the night to the other and promised to guard the frontiers of each other so that whenever hostilities were attempted SATIETY should be intercepted by LABOUR and LASSITUDE expelled by REST Thus the antient quarrel was appeased and as hatred is often succeeded by its contrary REST afterwards became pregnant by LABOUR and was delivered of HEALTH a benevolent goddess who consolidated the union of her  parents and contributed to the regular vicissitudes of their reign by dispensing her gifts to those only who shared their lives in just proportions between REST and LABOUR  NUMB  SATURDAY  July    Non sine vano  Aur arum et siluae meut  HOR  I HAVE been censured for having hitherto dedicated so few of my speculations to the ladies and indeed the moralist whose instructions are accommodated only to one half of the human species must be confessed not sufficiently to have extended his views Yet it is to be considered that masculine duties afford more room for counsels and observations as they are less uniform and connected with things more subject to vicissitude and accident we therefore find that in philosophical discourses which teach by precept or historical narratives that instruct by example the peculiar virtues or faults of women fill but a small part perhaps generally too small for so much of our domestic happiness is in their hands and their  influence is so great upon our earliest years that the universal interest of the world requires them to be well instructed in their province nor can it be thought proper that the qualities by which so much pain or pleasure may be given should be left to the direction of chance  I HAVE therefore willingly given a place in my paper to a letter which perhaps may not be wholly useless to them whose chief ambition is to please as it shews how certainly the end is missed by absurd and injudicious endeavours at distinction  To the RAMBLER  SIR  I AM a young gentleman at my own disposal with a considerableestate and having passed through the common forms of education spent some time in foreign countries and made myself distinguished since my return in the politest company I am now arrived at that part of life in which every man is expected to settle and provide for the continuation of his lineage I withstood for some time the solicitations and remonstrances of my aunts  and uncles but at last was persuaded to visit  Anthea  an heiress whose land lies contiguous to mine and whose birth and beauty are without objection Our friends declared that we were born for each other all those on both sides who had no interest in hindering our union contributed to promote it and were conspiring to hurry us into matrimony before we had any opportunity of knowing one another I was however too old to be given away without my own consent and having happened to pick up an opinion which to many of my relations seemed extremely odd that a man might be unhappy with a large estate determined to obtain a nearer knowledge of the person with whom I was to pass the remainder of my time To protract the courtship was by no means difficult for  Anthea  had a wonderful facility of evading questions which I seldom repeated and of barring approaches which I had no great eagerness to press  THUS the time passed away in visits and civilities without any ardent professions of love or formal offers of settlements I often attended her to publick places in which as is well known all behaviour is so much regulated  by custom that very little insight can be gained into the private character and therefore I was not yet able to inform myself of her humour and inclinations  AT last I ventured to propose to her to make one of a small party and spend a day in viewing a seat and gardens a few miles distant and having upon her compliance collected the rest of the company I brought at the hour a coach which I had borrowed from an acquaintance having delayed to buy one myself till I should have an opportunity of taking the lady's opinion for whose use it was intended  Anthea  came down but as she was going to step into the coach started back with great appearance of terror and told us that she durst not enter for the shocking colour of the lining had so much the air of the mourning coach in which she followed her aunt's funeral three years before that she should never have her poor dear aunt out of her head  I KNEW that it was not for lovers to argue with their mistresses I therefore sent back the coach and got another more gay Into this we all entered the coachman began to drive and we were amusing ourselves with the  expectation of what we should see when upon a small inclination of the carriage  Anthea  screamed out that we were overthrown We were obliged to fix all our attention upon her which she took care to keep up by renewing her outcries at every corner where we had occasion to turn at intervals she entertained us with fretful complaints of the uneasiness of the coach and obliged me to call several times on the coachman to take care and drive without jolting The poor fellow endeavoured to please us and therefore moved very slowly 'till  Anthea  found out that this pace would only keep us longer on the stones and desired that I would order him to make more speed He whipped his horses the coach jolted again and  Anthea  very complaisantly told us how much she repented that she made one of our company  AT last we got into the smooth road and began to think our difficulties at an end when on a sudden  Anthea  saw a brook before us which she could not venture to pass We were therefore obliged to alight that we might walk over the bridge but when we came to it we found it so narrow that  Anthea  durst not set her foot upon it and was  content after long consultation to call the coach back and with innumerable precautions terrors and lamentations crossed the brook  IT was necessary after this delay to mend our pace and directions were accordingly given to the coachman when  Anthea  informed us that it was common for the axle to catch fire with a quick motion and begged of me to look out every minute lest we should all be consumed I was forced to obey and give her from time to time the most solemn declarations that all was safe and that I hoped we should reach the place without losing our lives either by fire or water  THUS we passed on over ways soft and hard with more or with less speed but always with new vicissitudes of anxiety If the ground was hard we were jolted if soft we were sinking If we went fast we should be overturned if slowly we should never reach the place At length she saw something which she called a cloud and began to consider that at that time of the year it frequently thundered This seemed to be the capital terrour for after that the coach was suffered to  move on and no danger was thought too dreadful to be encountered provided she could get into a house before the thunder  THUS our whole conversation passed in dangers and cares and fears and consolations and stories of ladies dragged in the mire forced to spend all the night on a heath drowned in rivers or burnt with lightening and no sooner had a hairbreadth escape set us free from one calamity but we were threatened with another  AT length we reached the house where we intended to regale ourselves and I proposed to Anthea the choice of a great number of dishes which the place being well provided for entertainment happened to afford She made some objection to every thing that was offered one thing she hated at that time of the year another she could not bear since she had seen it spoiled at lady Feedwell's table another she was sure they could not dress at this house and another she could not touch without French sauce At last she fixed her mind upon salmon but there was no salmon in the house It was however procured with great expedition and when it came to the table  she found that her fright had taken away her stomach which indeed she thought no great loss for she could never believe that any thing at an inn could be cleanly got  DINNER was now over and the company proposed for I was now past the condition of making overtures that we should persue our original design of visiting the gardens  Anthea  declared that she could not imagine what pleasure we expected from the sight of a few green trees and a little gravel and two or three pits of clear water that for her part she hated walking till the cool of the evening and thought it very likely to rain and again wished that she had staid at home We then reconciled ourselves to our disappointment and began to talk on common subjects when  Anthea  told us that since we came to see gardens she would not hinder our satisfaction We all rose and walked through the enclosures for some time with no other trouble than the necessity of watching lest a frog should hop across the way which  Anthea  told us would certainly kill her if she should happen to see him  FROGS as it fell out there were none but  when we were within an acre of the gardens  Anthea  saw some sheep and heard the wether clink his bell which she was certain was not hung upon him for nothing and therefore no assurances nor intreaties should prevail upon her to go a step farther she was sorry to disappoint the company but her life was dearer to her than ceremony  WE came back to the inn and  Anthea  now discovered that there was no time to be lost in returning for the night would come upon us and a thousand misfortunes might happen in the dark The horses were immediately harnessed and  Anthea  having wondered what could seduce her to stay so long was eager to set out But we had now a new scene of terrour every man we saw was a robber and we were ordered sometimes to drive hard lest a traveller whom we saw behind should overtake us and sometimes to stop lest we should come up to him who was passing before us She alarmed many an honest man by begging him to spare her life as he passed by the coach and drew me into fifteen quarrels with persons who encreased her fright by kindly stopping to enquire whether they could assist us At last  we came home and she told hercompany next day what a pleasant ride she had been taking  I SUPPOSE Sir I need not enquire of you what deductions may be made from this narrative nor what happiness can arise from the society of that woman who mistakes cowardice for elegance and imagines all delicacy to consist in refusing to be pleased  I am c  FINIS
