 SPRING A POEM  SPRING A POEM  By Mr  THOMSON  Et nunc omnis Ager nunc omnis parturit Arbos  Nunc frondent Silvae nunc  formosissimus Annus  VIRG  LONDON  Printed And sold by A MILLAR at  Buchanan  's Head overagainst St  Clement  's Church in the  Strand  and G STRAHAN at the  Golden Ball  in  Cornhill  MDCCXXVIII  Price  s d    To the Right Honourable the Countess of HERTFORD  MADAM  _I HAVE always observed that in Addresses of this Nature the general Taste of the World demands ingenious Turns of Wit and  disguised artful Periods instead of an open Sincerity of Sentiment flowing in a plain Expression From what secret Impatience of the justest Praise when bestowed on Others this often proceeds rather than a pretended Delicacy is beyond my Purpose here to enquire But as nothing is more foreign to the Disposition of a Soul sincerely pleased with the Contemplation of what is beautiful and excellent than Wit and Turn I have too much Respect for your Ladyship's Character either to touch it in that gay trifling Manner or venture on a particular Detail  of those truly amiable Qualities of which it is composed A Mind exalted pure and elegant a Heart overflowing with Humanity and the whole Train of Virtues thence derived that give a pleasing Spirit to Conversation an engaging Simplicity to the Manners and form the Life to Harmony are rather to be felt and silently admired than expressed I have attempted in the following Poem to paint some of the most tender Beauties and delicate Appearances of Nature how much in vain your Ladyship's Taste will I am afraid but too soon discover Yet  would it still be a much easier Task to find Expression for all that Variety of Colour Form and Fragrance which enrich the Season I describe than to speak the many nameless Graces and Native Riches of a Mind capable so much at once to relish Solitude and adorn Society To whom then could these Sheets be more properly inscribed than to You MADAM whose Influence in the World can give them the Protection they want while your fine Imagination and intimate Acquaintance with  Rural Nature  will recommend them with the greatest  Advantage to your favourable Notice Happy if I have hit any of those Images and correspondent Sentiments your calm Evening Walks in the most delightful Retirement have oft inspired I could add too that as this Poem grew up under your Encouragement it has therefore a natural Claim to your Patronage Should You read it with Approbation it's Musick shall not droop and should it have the good Fortune to deserve your Smiles it's Roses shall not wither But where the Subject is so tempting lest I begin  my Poem before the Dedication is ended I here break short and beg Leave to subscribe my self with the highest Respect  MADAM  Your most Obedient Humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  ADVERTISEMENT  THAT the following Poem appears at present in Publick is not any way in Prejudice of the Proposals I lately Published for Printing the  FOUR SEASONS c  by Subscription but at the Solicitation of some of my Friends who had seen it in Manuscript and the better to carry on a Work I stand engaged to finish For  Subscription  is now at its last Gasp and the World seems to have got the better of that manyheaded Monster However those Gentlemen and Ladies who have been or may hereafter be so good as to honour me with their Names shall have the Book next Winter according to my Proposals And if it should in any Degree be judged worthy their Encouragement I have my best Reward  SPRING A POEM  _COME gentle SPRING Aetherial Mildness come  And from the Bosom of yon dropping Cloud  While Music wakes around veil'd in a Shower  Of shadowing Roses on our Plains descend  OH HERTFORD fitted or to shine in Courts  With unaffected Grace or walk the Plain  With  Innocence  and  Meditation  join'd  In soft Assemblage listen to my Song  Which thy own Season paints when Nature all  Is blooming and benevolent like Thee  AND see where surly WINTER passes off  Far to the North and calls his ruffian Blasts  His Blasts obey and quit the howling Hill  The shatter'd Forest and the ravag'd Vale  While softer Gales succeed at whose kind Touch  Dissolving Snows in sudden Torrents lost  The Mountains lift their green Heads to the Sky  As yet the trembling Year is unconfirm'd  And  Winter  oft at Eve resumes the Breeze  Chills the pale Morn and bids his driving Sleets  Deform the Day delightless so that scarce  The Bittern knows his Time with Bill ingulpht  To shake the sounding Marsh or from the Shore  The Plovers theirs to scatter o'er the Heath  And sing their wild Notes to the listening Waste  At last from  Aries  rolls the bounteous Sun  And the bright  Bull  receives Him Then no more  Th' expansive Atmosphere is cramp'd with Cold  But full of Life and vivifying Soul  Lifts the light Clouds sublime and spreads them thin  Fleecy and white o'er Allsurrounding Heaven  FORTH fly the tepid Aires and unconfin'd  Unbinding Earth the moving Softness strays  Joyous th' impatient Husbandman perceives  Relenting Nature and his lusty Steers  Drives from their Stalls to where the wellus'd Plow  Lies in the Furrow loosen'd from the Frost  There unrefusing to the harness'd yoke  They lend their Shoulder and begin their Toil  Chear'd by the simple Song and soaring Lark  Meanwhile incumbent o'er the shining Share  The Master leans removes th' obstructing Clay  Winds the whole Work and sidelong lays the Glebe  WHITE thro' the neighbring Fields the Sower stalks  With measur'd Step and liberal throws the Grain  Into the faithful Bosom of the Earth  The Harrow follows harsh and shuts the Scene  BE gracious  Heaven  for now laborious Man  Has done his Due Ye fostering Breezes blow  Ye softening Dews ye tender Showers descend  And temper all thou influential Sun  Into the perfect Year Nor Ye who live  In Luxury and Ease in Pomp and Pride  Think these lost Themes unworthy of your Ear  'Twas such as these the  Rural Maro  sung  To the full  Roman  Court in all it's height  Of Elegance and  Taste  The sacred Plow  Employ'd the Kings and Fathers of Mankind  In antient Times And Some with whom compar'd  You're but the Beings of a Summer's Day  Have held the Scale of Justice shook the Launce  Of mighty War then With descending Hand  Unus'd to little Delicacies feiz'd  The Plow and greatly independant liv'd  YE generous  Britons  cultivate the Plow  And o'er your Hills and long withdrawing Vales  Let  Autumn  spread his Treasures to the Sun  Luxuriant and unbounded As the Sea  Far thro' his azure turbulent Extent  Your Empire owns and from a thousand Shores  Wafts all the Pomp of Life into your Ports  So with superior Boon may your rich Soil  Exuberant Nature's better Blessings pour  O'er every Land the naked Nations cloath  And be th' exhaustless Granary of the World  NOR thro' the lenient Air alone this Change  Delicious breathes the penetrative Sun  His Force deepdarting to the dark Retreat  Of Vegetation sets the steaming Power  At large to wander o'er the vernant Earth  In various Hues but chiefly Thee gay  Green  Thou smiling  Nature  's universal Robe  United Light and Shade where the Sight dwells  With growing Strength and evernew Delight  FROM the moist Meadow to the brownbrow'd Hill  Led by the Breeze the vivid Verdure runs  And swells and deepens to the cherish'd Eye  The Hawthorn whitens and the juicy Groves  Put forth their Buds unfolding by Degrees  Till the whole leafy Forest stands display'd  In full Luxuriance to the sighing Gales  While the Deer rustle thro' the twining Brake  And the Birds sing conceal'd At once array'd  In all the Colours of the flushing Year  By  Nature  's swift and secretworking Hand  The Garden glows and fills the liberal Air  With lavish Fragrance while the promis'd Fruit  Lies yet a little Embrio unperceiv'd  Within it's Crimson Folds Now from the Town  Buried in Smoak and Sleep and noisome Damps  Oft let me wander o'er the dewy Fields  Where Freshness breathes and dash the lucid Drops  From the bent Bush as thro' the fuming Maze  Of SweetBriar Hedges I pursue my Walk  Or taste the Smell of Dairy or ascend  Some Eminence  Augusta  in thy Plains  And see the Country fardiffus'd around  One boundless Blush one snowempurpled Shower  Of mingled Blossoms where the raptur'd Eye  Travels from Joy to Joy and hid beneath  The fair Profusion yellow  Autumn  spies  IF brush'd from  Russian  Wilds a cutting Gale  Rise not and scatter from his foggy Wings  The bitter Mildew or dryblowing breathe  Untimely Frost before whose baleful Blast  The fullblown  Spring  thro' all her Foliage shrinks  Into a smutty widedejected Waste  For oft engender'd by the hazy North  Myriads on Myriads InsectArmies waft  Keen in the poison'd Breeze and wasteful eat  Thro' Buds and Bark even to the Heart of Oak  Their eager Way A feeble Race scarce seen  Save to the prying Eye yet Famine waits  On their corrosive Course and starves the Year  Sometimes o'er Cities as they steer their Flight  Where rising Vapour melts their Wings away  Gaz'd by th' astonish'd Crowd the horrid Shower  Descends And hence the skillful Farmer Chaff  And blazing Straw before his Orchard burns  Till all involv'd in Smoak the latent Foe  From every Cranny suffocated falls  Or Onions steaming hot beneath his Trees  Exposes fatal to the frosty Tribe  Nor from their friendly Task the busy Bill  Of little trooping Birds instinctive scares  THESE are not idle Philosophic Dreams  Full Nature swarms with Life Th' unfaithful Fen  In putrid Steams emits the living Cloud  Of Pestilence Thro' subterranean Cells  Where searching SunBeams never found a Way  Earth animated heaves The flowery Leaf  Wants not it's soft Inhabitants The Stone  Hard as it is in every winding Pore  Holds Multitudes But chief the ForestBoughs  Which dance unnumber'd to th' inspiring Breeze  The downy Orchard and the melting Pulp  Of mellow Fruit the nameless Nations feed  Of evanescent Insects Where the Pool  Stands mantled o'er with Green invisible  Amid the floating Verdure Millions stray  Each Liquid too whether of acid Taste  Milky or strong with various Forms abounds  Nor is the lucid Stream nor the pure Air  Tho' one transparent Vacancy they seem  Devoid of theirs Even Animals subsist  On Animals in infinite Descent  And all so fine adjusted that the Loss  Of the least Species would disturb the whole  Stranger than this th' inspective Glass confirms  And to the Curious gives th' amazing Scenes  Of lessning Life by  Wisdom  kindly hid  From Eye and Ear of Man for if at once  The Worlds in Worlds enclos'd were push'd to Light  Seen by his sharpen'd Eye and by his Ear  Intensely bended Heard from the choice Cate  The freshest Viands and the brightest Wines  He'd turn abhorrent and in Dead of Night  When Silence sleeps o'er all be stun'd with Noise  THE NorthEast spends his Rage and now shut up  Within his Iron Caves th' effusive South  Warms the wide Air and o'er the Void of Heaven  Breathes the big Clouds with vernal Showers distent  At first a dusky Wreath they seem to rise  Scarce staining Aether but by fast Degrees  In Heaps on Heaps the doubling Vapour sails  Along the loaded Sky and mingling thick  Sits on th' Horizon round a settled Gloom  Not such as wintry Storms on Mortals shed  Oppressing Life but lovely gentle kind  And full of every Hope and every Joy  The Wish of Nature Gradual sinks the Breeze  Into a perfect Calm that not a Breath  Is heard to quiver thro' the closing Woods  Or rustling turn the manytwinkling Leaves  Of Aspin tall Th' uncurling Floods diffus'd  In glassy Breadth seem thro' delusive Lapse  Forgetful of their Course'Tis Silence all  And pleasing Expectation Herds and Flocks  Drop the dry Sprig and muteimploring eye  The falling Verdure Hush'd in short Suspense  The plumy People streak their Wings with Oil  And wait th' approaching Sign to strike at once  Into the general Choir Ev'n Mountains Vales  And Forests seem expansive to demand  The promis'd Sweetness Man superior walks  Amid the glad Creation musing Praise  And looking lively Gratitude At last  The Clouds consign their Treasures to the Fields  And softly shking on the dimply Pool  Prelusive Drops let all their Moisture flow  In large Effusion o'er the freshen'd World  'Tis scarce to patter heard the stealing Shower  By such as wander thro' the ForestWalks  Beneath th' umbrageous Multitude of Leaves  But who would hold the Shade while  Heaven  descends  In universal Bounty shedding Herbs  And Fruits and Flowers on  Nature  's ample Lap  Imagination fir'd prevents their Growth  And while the verdant Nutriment distills  Beholds the kindling Country colour round  THUS all Day long the fulldistended Clouds  Indulge their genial Stores and wellshowr'd Earth  Is deep enrich'd with vegetable Life  Till in the Western Sky the downward Sun  Looks out illustrious from amid the Flush  Of broken Clouds gayshifting to his Beam  The rapid Radiance instantaneous strikes  Th' illumin'd Mountain thro' the Forest streams  Shakes on the Floods and in a yellow Mist  Farsmoaking o'er th' interminable Plain  In twinkling Myriads lights the dewy Gems  Moist bright and green the Landskip laughs around  Full swell the Woods their every Musick wakes  Mix'd in wild Consort with the warbling Brooks  Increas'd th' unnumber'd Bleatings of the Hills  The hollow Lows responsive from the Vales  Whence blending all the sweeten'd Zephir springs  Meantime retracted from yon Eastern Cloud  Bestriding Earth the grand aetherial Bow  Shoots up immense and every Hue unfolds  In fair Proportion running from the Red  To where the Violet fades into the Sky  Here mighty  Newton  the dissolving Clouds  Are as they scatter round thy numerous Prism  Untwisting to the Philosophic Eye  The various Twine os Light by Thee pursu'd  Thro' all the mingling Maze Not so the Swain  He wondering views the bright Enchantment bend  Delightful o'er the radiant Fields and runs  To catch the falling Glory but amaz'd  Beholds th' amusive Arch before him fly  Then vanish quite away Still Night succeeds  A soften'd Shade and saturated Earth  Awaits the Morning Beam to give again  Transmuted soon by Nature's Chymistry  The blooming Blessings of the former Day  THEN spring the living Herbs profusely wild  O'er all the deepgreen Earth beyond the Power  Of  Botanist▪  to number up their Tribes  Whether he steals along the lonely Dale  In silent Search or thro' the Forest rank  With what the dull Incurious Weeds account  Bursts his blind Way or climbs the MountainRock  Fir'd by the nodding Verdure of its Brow  With such a liberal Hand has  Nature  slung  Their Seeds abroad blown them about in Winds  Innumerous mix'd then with the nursing Mold  The moistening Current and prolific Rain  BUT who their Virtues can declare who pierce  With holy Eye into these secret Stores  Of Life and Health and Joy The Food of Man  While yet he liv'd in Innocence and told  A Length of golden Years unflesh'd in Blood  A Stranger to the Savage Arts of Life  Death Rapine Carnage Surfeit and Disease  The Lord and not the Tyrant of the World  THEN the glad Morning wak'd the gladden'd Race  Of uncorrupted Men nor blush'd to see  The Sluggard sleep beneath her sacred Beam  For their light Slumbers gently fum'd away  And up they rose as vigorous as the Sun  Or to the Culture of the willing Glebe  Or to the chearful Tendance of the Flock  Meantime the Song went round and Dance and Sport  Wisdom and friendly Talk successive stole  Their Hours away While in the rosy Vale  Love breath'd his Infant Sighs from Anguish free  Fragrant with Bliss and only wept for Joy  Nor yet injurious Act nor surly Deed  Was known among these happy Sons of Heaven  For Reason and Benevolence were Law  Harmonious Nature too look'd smiling on  Clean shone the Skies cool'd with eternal Gales  And balmy Spirit all The youthful Sun  Shot his best Rays and still the gracious Clouds  Drop'd Fatness down as o'er the swelling Mead  The Herds and Flocks commixing play'd secure  Which when emergent from the gloomy Wood  The glaring Lyon saw his horrid Heart  Was meeken'd and he join'd his sullen Joy  For Musick held the whole in perfect Peace  Soft sigh'd the Flute the tender Voice was heard  Warbling the joyous Heart the Woodlands round  Apply'd their Quire and Winds and Waters flow'd  In ConsonanceSuch were these Prime of Days  THIS to the  Poets  gave the golden Age  When as they sung in Allegoric Phraze  The SailorPine had not the Nations yet  In Commerce mix'd for every Country teem'd  With every Thing Spontaneous Harvests wav'd  Still in a Sea of yellow Plenty round  The Forest was the Vineyard where untaught  To climb unprun'd and wild the juicy Grape  Burst into Floods of Wine The knotted Oak  Shook from his Boughs the long transparent Streams  Of Honey creeping thro' the matted Grass  Th' uncultivated Thorn a ruddy Shower  Of Fruitage shed on such as sat below  In blooming Ease and from brown Labour free  Save what the copious Gathering grateful gave  The Rivers foam'd with Nectar or diffuse  Silent and soft the milky Maze devolv'd  Nor had the spongy fullexpanded Fleece  Yet drunk the  Tyrian  Die The stately Ram  Shone thro' the Mead in native Purple clad  Or milder Saffron and the dancing L  mb  The vivid Crimson to the Sun disclos'd  Nothing had Power to hurt the savage Soul  Yet untransfus'd  the Tyger's Heart  Burn'd not his Bowels nor his gamesome Paw  Drove on the fleecy Partners of his Play  While from the flowery Brake the Serpent roll'd  His fairer Spires and play'd his pointless Tongue  BUT now whate'er these gaudy Fables meant  And the white Minutes that they shadow'd out  Are found no more amid these Iron Times  These Dregs of Life in which the Human Mind  Has lost that Harmony ineffable  Which forms the Soul of Happiness and all  Is off the Poise within the Passions all  Have burst their Bounds and Reason half extinct  Or impotent or else approving sees  The foul Disorder Anger storms at large  Without an equal Cause and fell Revenge  Supports the falling Rage Close Envy bites  With venom'd Tooth while weak unmanly Fear  Full of frail Fancies loosens every Power  Even Love itself is Bitterness of Soul  A pleasing Anguish pining at the Heart  Hope sickens with Extravagance and Grief  Of Life impatient into Madness swells  Or in dead Silence wastes the weeping Hours  These and a thousand new Emotions more  That from their Mixture spring distract the Mind  With endless Tumult Whence resulting rise  The selfish Thought a listless Inconcern  Cold and averting from our Neighbour's Good  Then dark Disgust and Malice winding Wiles  Sneaking Deceit and Coward Villany  At last unruly Hatred lewd Reproach  Convulsive Wrath and thoughtless Fury quick  To every evil Deed Even Nature's self  Is deem'd vindictive to have chang'd her Course  HENOE in old Time they say a Deluge came  When the drycrumbling Orb of Earth which arch'd  Th' imprison'd Deep around impetuous rush'd  With Ruin inconceivable at once  Into the Gulph and o'er the highest Hills  Widedash'd the Waves in Undulation vast  Till from the Centre to the streaming Clouds  A shoreless Ocean tumbled round the Globe  THE  Seasons  since as hoar  Tradition  tells  Have kept their constant Chace the  Winter  keen  Pour'd out his Waste of Snows and  Summer  shot  His pestilential Heats great  Spring  before  Green'd all the Year and Fruits and Blossoms blush'd  In social Sweetness on the selfsame Bough  Clear was the temperate Air an even Calm  Perpetual reign'd save what the Zephirs bland  Breath'd o'er the blue Expanse for then nor Storms  Were taught to blow nor Hurricanes to rage  Sound slept the Waters no sulphureous Glooms  Swell'd in the Sky and sent the Lightning forth  While sickly Damps and cold Autumnal Fogs  Sat not pernicious on the Springs of Life  But now from clear to cloudy moist to dry  And hot to cold in restless Change revolv'd  Our droopipg Days are dwindled down to nought  The fleeting Shadow of a Winter's Sun  AND yet the wholesome Herb neglected dies  In lone Obscurity unpriz'd for Food  Altho' the pure exhilerating Soul  Of Nutriment and Health salubrious breathes  By  Heaven  infus'd along it's secret Tubes  For with hot Ravine fir'd ensanguin'd Man  Is now become the Lyon of the Plain  And worse The Wolf who from the nightly Fold  Fiercedrags the bleating Prey ne'er drunk her Milk  Nor Wore her warming Fleece nor has the Steer  At whose strong Chest the deadly Tyger hangs  E'er plow'd for him They too are temper'd high  With Hunger stung and wild Necessity  Nor lodges Pity in their shaggy Breasts  But  Man  whom  Nature  form'd of milder Clay  With every kind Emotion in his Heart  And taught alone to weep while from her Lap  She pours ten thousand Delicacies Herbs  And Fruits as numerous as the drops of Rain  And Beams which gave them Birth shall He fair Form  Who wears sweet Smiles and looks erect on Heaven  E'er stoop to mingle with the prowling Herd  And dip his Tongue in Blood The Beast of Prey  'Tis true deserves the Fate in which He deals  Him from the Thicket let the hardy Youth  Provoke and foaming thro' th' awakened Woods  With every Nerve pursue But You ye Flocks  What have ye done ye peaceful People what  To merit Death You who have given us Milk  In luscious Streams and lent us your own Coat  Against the Winter's Cold whose Usefulness  In living only lies And the plain Ox  That harmless honest guileless Animal  In what has He offended He whose Toil  Patient and everready cloaths the Fields  With all the Pomp of Harvest shall He bleed  And wrestling groan beneath the cruel Hands  Even of the Clowns he feeds And that perhaps  To swell the Riot of the gathering Feast  Won by his Labour Thus the feeling Heart  Would tenderly suggest But 'tis enough  In this late Age adventurous to have touch'd  Light on the Numbers of the  Samian  Sage  High  Heaven  beside forbids the daring Strain  Whose wisest Will has fix'd us in a State  Which must not yet to pure Perfection rise  BUT yonder breathing Prospect bids the Muse  Throw all her Beauty forth that Daubing all  Will be to what I gaze for who can paint  Like  Nature  Can  Imagination  boast  Amid his gay Creation Hues like Her's  And can He mix them with that matchless Skill  And lay them on so delicately sweet  And lose them in each other as appears  In every Bud that blows If Fancy then  Unequal fails beneath the lovely Task  Ah what shall Language do Ah where find Words  Ting'd with so many Colours And whose Power  To Life approaching may perfume my Lays  With that fine Oil these aromatic Gales  Which inexhaustive flow continual round  YET tho' successless will the Toil delight  Come then ye Virgins and ye Youths whose Hearts  Have felt the Raptures of refining Love  Oh come and while the rosyfooted  May  Steals blushing on together let us walk  The Morning Dews and gather in their Prime  Freshblooming Flavours to deck the flowing Hair  And for a Breast which can improve their Sweets  SEE where the winding Vale her lavish Stores  Irriguous spreads See how the Lilly drinks  The latent Rill scarce oozing thro' the Grass  Of Growth luxuriant or the humid Bank  Profusely climbs Turgent in every Pore  The Gummy Moisture shines new Lustre lends  And feeds the Spirit that diffusive round  Refreshes all the Dale Long let us walk  Where the Breeze blows from yon extended Field  Of blossom'd Beans  Arabia  cannot boast  A fuller Gale of Joy than liberal thence  Breathes thro' the Sense and takes the ravish'd Soul  Nor is the Meadow worthless of our Foot  Full of fresh Verdure and unnumber'd Flowers  The Negligence of  Nature  wide and wild  Where undisguis'd by mimic  Art  she shows  Unbounded Beauty to the boundless Eye  'Tis here that their delicious Task the Bees  In swarming Millions tend Around athwart  This Way and that the busy Nations fly  Cling to the Bud and with inserted Tube  It's Soul it's Sweetness and it's Manna suck  The little Chymist thus allmoving  Heaven  Has taught And oft of bolder Wing he dares  The Purple Heath or where the WildThyme grow  And yellow loads him with the luscious Spoil  AT length the finish'd Garden to the View  It's Vistas opens and it's Alleys green  Snatch'd thro' the verdant Maze the hurried Eye  Distracted wanders now the bowery Walk  Of Covert close where scarce a Speck of Day  Falls on the lengthen'd Gloom protracted darts  Now meets the bending Sky the River now  Dimpling along the breezyruffled Lake  The Forest running round the rising Spire  Th' aetherial Mountain and the distant Main  But why so far excursive When at Hand  Along the blushing Borders dewybright  And in yon mingled Wilderness of Flowers  Fairhanded  Spring  unbosoms every Grace  Throws out the SnowDrop and the Crocus first  The Daisy Primrose Violet darkly blue  Softbending Cowslips and of nameless Dies  Anemonies Auriculas a Tribe  Peculiar powder'd with a shining Sand  Renunculas and Iris manyhued  Then comes the TulipRace where Beauty plays  Her gayest Freaks from Family diffus'd  To Family as flies the FatherDust  The varied Colours run and while they break  On the charm'd  Florist  's Eye he wondering stands  And newflush'd Glories all ecstatic marks  Nor Hyacinths are wanting nor Junquils  Of potent Fragrance nor Narcissus white  Nor deep Carnations nor enamel'd Pinks  And showr'd from every Bush the DamaskRose  Infinite Numbers Delicacies Smells  With Hues on Hues Expression cannot paint  The Breath of  Nature  and her endless Bloom  HAIL  Mighty Being Universal Soul  Of Heaven and Earth  Essential Presence  hail  To  Thee  I bend the Knee to  Thee  my Thoughts  Continual climb who with a MasterHand  Hast the great Whole into Perfection touch'd  By  Thee  the various vegetative Tribes  Wrapt in a filmy Net and clad with Leaves  Draw the live Aether and imbibe the Dew  By  Thee  dispos'd into cogenial Soils  Stands each attractive Plant and sucks and swells  The juicy Tide a twining Mass of Tubes  At  Thy  Command the vernal Sun awakes  The torpid Sap detruded to the Root  By Wintry Winds that now in fluent Dance  And lively Fermentation mounting spreads  All this innumerouscolour'd Scene of things  ASCENDING from the vegetable World  To higher Life with equal Wing ascend  My panting Muse and hark how loud the Woods  Invite you forth in all your gayest Trim  Lend me your Song ye Nightingales oh pout  The mazyrunning Soul of Melody  Into my varied Verse while I deduce  From the first Note the hollow Cuckoo sings  The Symphony of  Spring  and touch a Theme  Unknown to Fame the Passion of the Groves  JUST as the Spirit of Love is sent abroad  Warm thro' the vital Air and on their Hearts  Harmonious seizes the gay Troops begin  In gallant Thought to plume their painted Wings  And try again the longforgotten Strain  At first faintwarbled But no sooner grows  The soft Infusion prevalent and wide  Than all alive at once their Joy o'erflows  In Music unconfin'd Upsprings the Lark  Shrillvoiced and loud the Messenger of Morn  Ere yet the Shadows fly He mounted sings  Amid the dawning Clouds and from their Haunts  Calls up the tuneful Nations Every Copse  Thickwove and Tree irregular and Bush  Bending with dewy Moisture o'er the Heads  Of the coy Quiristers that lodge within  Are prodigal of Harmony The Thrush  And WoodLark o'er the kindcontending Throng  Superior heard run thro' the sweetest Length  Of Notes when listening  Philomela  deigns  To let them joy and purposes in Thought  Elate to make her Night excel their Day  The Blackbird whistles from the thorny Brake  The mellow Bullfinch answers from the Grove  Nor are the Linnets o'er the flowering Furze  Pour'd out profusely silent Join'd to These  Thousands beside thick as the covering Leaves  They warble under or the nitid Hues  Which speck them o'er their Modulations mix  Mellifluous The Jay the Rook the Daw  And all these jangling Pipes when heard alone  Here aid the Consort while the WoodDove breathes  A melancholy Murmur thro' the whole  'Tis Love creates their Gaiety and all  This Waste of Music is the Voice of Love  Which even to Birds and Beasts the tender Arts  Of Pleasing teaches Hence the glossy Kind  Try every winning Way inventive Love  Can dictate and in fluttering Courtship pour  Their little Souls before Her Wide around  Respectful first in airy Rings they rove  Endeavouring by a thousand Tricks to catch  The cunning conscious halfaverted Glance  Of their regardless Charmer Should she seem  Softening the least Approvance to bestow  Their Colours burnish and by Hope inspir'd  They brisk advance then on a sudden struck  Retire disorder'd then again approach  And throwing out the last Efforts of Love  In fond Rotation spread the spotted Wing  And shiver every Feather with Desire  CONNUBIAL Leagues agreed to the deep Woods  They haste away each as their Fancy leads  Pleasure or Food or latent Safety prompts  That  Nature  's great Command may be obey'd  Nor all these sweet Sensations they perceive  Indulg'd in vain Some to the HollyHedge  Nestling repair and to the Thicket some  Some to the rude Protection of the Thorn  Resolve to trust their Young The clefted Tree  Offers it's kind Concealment to a Few  Their Food it's Insects and it's Moss their Nests  Others apart far in the grassy Dale  Their humble Texture weave But most delight  In unfrequented Glooms or shaggy Banks  Steep and divided by a babbling Brook  Whose Murmurs sooth them all the livelong Day  When for a Season fix'd Among the Roots  Of Hazel pendant o'er the plaintive Stream  They frame the first Foundation of their Domes  Dry Sprigs of Trees in artful Manner laid  And bound with Clay together Now 'tis nought  But Hurry Hurry thro' the busy Air  Beat by unnumber'd Wings The Swallow sweeps  The slimy Pool to build his hanging House  Ingeniously intent Oft from the Back  Of Herds and Flocks a thousand tugging Bills  Pluck Hair and Wool and oft when unobserv'd  Steal from the Barn the Straw till soft and warm  Clean and compleat their Habitation grows  MEANTIME the patient Dam assiduous sits  Not to be tempted from her tender Task  Or by sharp Hunger or by smooth Delight  Tho' the whole loosen'd Spring around her blows  Her sympathizing Lover takes his Stand  High on th' opponent Bank and ceaseless sings  The tedious Time away or else supplies  Her Place a Moment while she sudden flits  To pick the scanty Meal Th' appointed Time  With pious Toil fulfill'd the callow Young  Warm'd and expanded into perfect Life  Their brittle Bondage break and come to Light  A helpless Family demanding Food  With constant Clamour Oh what Passions then  What melting Sentiments of kindly Care  Seize the new Parents' Hearts Away they fly  Affectionate and undesiring bear  The most delicious Morsel to their Young  Which equally distributed again  The Search begins So pitiful and poor  A gentle Pair on Providential  Heaven  Cast as they weeping eye their clamant Train  Check their own Appetites and give them all  NOR is the Courage of the fearful Kind  Nor is their Cunning less should some rude Foot  Their Woody Haunts molest stealthy aside  Into the Centre of a neighbring Bush  They drop and whirring thence alarm'd deceive  The rambling SchoolBoy Hence around the Head  Of Traveller the whitewing'd Plover wheels  Her sounding Flight and then directly on  In long Excursion skims the level Lawn  To tempt you from her Nest The WildDuck hence  O'er the rough Moss and o'er the trackless Waste  The HeathHen flutters as if hurt to lead  The hot pursuing Spaniel far astray  BE not the Muse asham'd here to bemoan  Her Brothers of the Grove by Tyrant Man  Inhuman caught and in the narrow Cage  From Liberty confin'd and boundless Air  Dull are the pretty Slaves their Plumage dull  Ragged and all it's brightning Lustre lost  Nor is that luscious Wildness in their Notes  That warbles from the Beech Oh then desist  Ye Friends of Harmony this barbarous Art  Forbear if Innocence and Music can  Win on your Hearts or Piety perswade  BUT let not chief the Nightingale lament  Her ruin'd Care too delicately fram'd  To brook the harsh Confinement of the Cage  Oft when returning with her loaded Bill  Th' astonish'd Mother finds a vacant Nest  By the hard Hands of unrelenting Clowns  Rob'd to the Ground the vain Provision falls  Her Pinions ruffle and lowdrooping scarce  Can bear the Mourner to the Poplar Shade  Where allabandon'd to Despair she sings  Her Sorrows thro' the Night and on the Bough  Sadsitting still at every dying Fall  Takes up again her lamentable Strain  Of winding Woe till wide around the Woods  Sigh at her Song and with her Wail resound  AND now the feather'd Youth their former Bounds  Ardent disdain and weighing oft their Wings  Demand the free Poss  ssion of the Sky  But this glad Office more and then dissolves  Parental Love at once for needless grown  Unlavish  Wisdom  never works in vain  'Tis on some Evening sunny grateful mild  When nought but Balm is breathing thro' the Woods  With yellow Lustre bright that the new Tribes  Visit the spacious Heavens and look abroad  On  Nature  's Common far as they can see  Or wing their Range and Pasture O'er the Boughs  Dancing about still at the giddy Verge  Their Resolution fails their Pinions still  In loose Libration stretch'd the void Abrupt  Trembling refuse till down before them fly  The ParentGuides and chide exhort command  Or push them off The surging Air receives  The plumy Burden and their selftaught Wings  Winnow the waving Element On Ground  Alighted bolder up again they lead  Farther and farther on the lengthning Flight  Till vanish'd every Fear and every Power  Rouz'd into Life and Action in the Void  Th' exoner'd Parents see their soaring Race  And once rejoicing never know them more  HIGH from the Summit of a craggy Cliff  Hung o'er the green Sea grudging at it's Base  The Royal Eagle draws his Young resolv'd  To try them at the Sun Strongpounc'd and bright  As burnish'd Day they up the blue Sky wind  Leaving dull Sight below and with fixt Gaze  Drink in their native Noon The FatherKing  Claps his glad Pinions and approves the Birth  AND should I wander to the Rural Seat  Whose aged Oaks and venerable Gloom  Invite the noisy Rook with Pleasure there  I might the various Polity survey  Of the mixt Houshold Kind The careful Hen  Calls all her chirping Family around  Fed and defended by the fearless Cock  Whose Breast with Ardour flames as on he walks  Graceful and crows Defiance In the Pond  The finelychecker'd Duck before her Train  Rows garrulous The statelysailing Swan  Gives out his snowy Plumage to the Gale  And arching proud his Neck with oary Feet  Bears onward fierce and beats you from the Bank  Protective of his Young The Turkey nigh  Loudthreatning reddens while the Peacock spreads  His everycolour'd Glory to the Sun  And swims in floating Majesty along  O'er the whole homely Scene the cooing Dove  Flies thick in amorous Chace and wanton rolls  The glancing Eye and turns the changeful Neck  WHILE thus the gentle Tenants of the Shade  Indulge their purer Loves the rougher World  Of Brutes below rush furious into Flame  And fierce Desire Thro' all his lusty Veins  The Bull deepscorcht receives the raging Fire  Of Pasture sick and negligent of Food  Scarceseen he wades among the yellow Broom  While o'er his brawny Back the rambling Sprays  Luxuriant shoot or thro' the mazy Wood  Dejected wanders nor th' inticing Bud  Crops tho' it presses on his careless Sense  For wrapt in mad Imagination he  Roars for the Fight and idly butting feigns  A Rival gor'd in every knotty Trunk  Such should he meet the bellowing War begins  Their Eyes flash Fury to the hollow'd Earth  Whence the Sand flies they mutter bloody Deeds  And groaning vast th' impetuous Battel mix  While the fair Heifer redolent in View  Stands kindling up their Rage The trembling Steed  With this hot Impulse seiz'd in every Nerve  Nor hears the Rein nor heeds the sounding Whip  Blows are not felt but tossing high his Head  And by the wellknown Joy to distant Plains  Attracted strong all wild he bursts away  O'er Rocks and Woods and craggy Mountains flies  And neighing on th' aerial Summit takes  Th' informing Gale then steepdescending stems  The headlong Torrents foaming down the Hills  Even where the Madness of the straiten'd Stream  Turns in black Eddies round Such is the Force  With which his frantic Heart and Sinews swell  NOR undelighted by the boundless  Spring  Are the broad Monsters of the Deep thro' all  Their oozy Caves and gelid Kingdoms rous'd  They flounce and tumble in unwieldy Joy  Dire were the Strain and dissonant to sing  The cruel Raptures of the Savage Kind  How the red Lioness her Whelps forgot  Amid the thoughtless Fury of her Heart  The lank rapacious Wolf th' unshapely Bear  The spotted Tyger fellest of the Fell  And all the Terrors of the  Lybian  Swain  By this new Flame their Native Wrath sublim'd  Roam the resounding Waste in fiercer Bands  And growl their horrid Loves But this the Theme  I sing transported to the  British  Fair  Forbids and leads me to the Mountainbrow  Where sits the Shepherd on the grassy Turf  Inhaling healthful the descending Sun  Around Him feeds his manybleating Flock  Of various Cadence and his sportive Lambs  This way and that convolv'd in friskful Glee  Their little Frolicks play And now the Race  Invites them forth when swift the Signal given  They start away and sweep the circly Mound  That runs around the Hill the Rampart once  Of Iron War in antient barbarous Times  When disunited  Britain  ever bled  Lost in eternal Broil ere yet she grew  To this deeplaid indissoluble State  Where  Wealth  and  Commerce  lift their golden Head  And o'er our Labours  Liberty  and  Law  Illustrious watch the Wonder of a World  WHAT is this  mighty Breath  ye Curious say  Which in a Language rather felt than heard  Instructs the Fowls of Heaven and thro' their Breasts  These Arts of Love diffusesWhat but  GOD  Inspiring  GOD  who boundless Spirit all  And unremitting Energy pervades  Subsists adjusts and agitates the Whole  He ceaseless works alone and yet alone  Seems not to work so exquisitely fram'd  Is this complex amazing Scene of Things  But tho' conceal'd to every purer Eye  Th' informing Author in his Works appears  His Grandeur in the Heavens the Sun and Moon  Whether that fires the Day or falling this  Pours out a lucid Softness o'er the Night  Are but a Beam from Him The glittering Stars  By the deep Ear of Meditation heard  Still in their Midnight Watches sing of Him  He nods a Calm The Tempest blows His Wrath  Roots up the Forest and o'erturns the Main  The Thunder is His Voice and the red Flash  His speedy Sword of Justice At His Touch  The Mountains flame He takes the solid Earth  And rocks the Nations Nor in these alone  In every common Instance  GOD  is seen  And to the Man who casts his mental Eye  Abroad unnotic'd Wonders rise But chief  In Thee Boon  Spring  and in thy softer Scenes  The  Smiling GOD  appears while Water Earth  And Air attest his Bounty which instils  Into the Brutes this temporary Thought  And annual melts their undesigning Hearts  Profusely thus in Tenderness and Joy  STILL let my Song a nobler Note assume  And sing th' infusive Force of  Spring  on Man  When Heaven and Earth as if contending vie  To raise his Being and serene his Soul  Can he forbear to smile with  Nature  Can  The stormy Passions in his Bosom rowl  While every Gale is Peace and every Grove  Is Melody Hence from the bounteous Walks  Of flowing  Spring  ye fordid Sons of Earth  Hard and unfeeling of Another's Woe  Or only lavish to Yourselvesaway  But come ye generous Breasts in whose wide Thought  Of all his Works  Creative Bounty  most  Divinely burns and on your open Front  And liberal Eye sits from his dark Retreat  Inviting modest Want Nor only fair  And easy of Approach your active Search  Leaves no cold wintry Corner unexplor'd  Like silentworking  Heaven  surprizing oft  The lonely Heart with unexpected Good  For you the roving Spirit of the Wind  Blows  Spring  abroad for you the teeming Clouds  Descend in buxom Plenty o'er the World  And the Sun spreads his genial Blaze for you  Ye flower of Human Race In these green Days  Sadpining Sickness lifts her languid Head  Life flows afresh and youngey'd Health exalts  The whole Creation round Contentment walks  The Sunny Glade and feels an inward Bliss  Spring o'er his Mind beyond the Pride of Kings  E'er to bestow Serenity apace  Induces Thought and Contemplation still  By small Degrees the Love of Nature works  And warms the Bosom till at last arriv'd  To Rapture and enthusiastic Heat  We feel the present  Deity  and taste  The Joy of  GOD  to see a happy World  'Tis  Harmony  that Worldembracing Power  By which all Beings are adjusted each  To all around impelling and impell'd  In endless Circulation that inspires  This universal Smile Thus the glad Skies  The widerejoycing Earth the Woods the Streams  With every  Life  they hold down to the Flower  That paints the lowly Vale or InsectWing  Wav'd o'er the Shepherd's Slumber touch the Mind  To Nature tun'd with a lightflying Hand  Invisible quickurging thro' the Nerves  The glittering Spirits in a Flood of Day  HENCE from the Virgin's Cheek a fresher Bloom  Shoots less and less the live Carnation round  Her Lips blush deeper Sweets she breathes of Youth  The shining Moisture swells into her Eyes  In brighter Flow her wishing Bosom heaves  With Palpitations wild kind Tumults seize  Her Veins and all her yielding Soul is Love  From the keen Gaze her Lover turns away  Full of the dear ecstatic Power and sick  With sighing Languishment Ah then ye Fair  Be greatly cautious of your sliding Hearts  Dare not th' infectious Sigh the pleading Eye  In meek Submission drest deject and low  But full of tempting Guile Let not the Tongue  Prompt to deceive with Adulation smooth  Gain on your purpos'd Wills Nor in the Bower  Where Woodbines flaunt and Roses shed a Couch  While Evening draws her crimson'd Curtains round  Trust your soft Minutes with betraying Man  AND let th' aspiring Youth beware of Love  And shun th' enchanting Glance for 'tis too late  When on his Heart the Torrent Softness pours  Then Interest sinks to Dirt and distant Fame  Dissolves in Air away While the fond Soul  Is wrapt in Dreams of Ecstacy and Bliss  Still paints th' illusive Form the kindling Grace  Th' alluring Smile the full aethereal Eye  Effusing Heaven and listens ardent still  To the small Voice where Harmony and Wit  A modest melting mingled Sweetness flow  No sooner is the fair Idea form'd  And Contemplation fixes on the Theme  Than from his own Creation wild He flies  Sick of a Shadow Absence comes apace  And shoots his every Pang into his Breast  'Tis nought but Gloom around The darken'd Sun  Loses his Light The rosybosom'd  Spring  To weeping Fancy pines and yon bright Arch  Of Heaven lowbends into a dusky Vault  All Nature fades extinct and She alone  Heard felt and seen possesses every Thought  Fills every Sense and pants in every Vein  Books are but formal Dulness tedious Friends  And sad amid the Social Band he sits  Lonely and inattentive From the Tongue  Th' unfinish'd Period falls white born away  On swelling Thought his wafted Spirit flies  To the dear Bosom of his absent Fair  And leaves the Semblance of a Lover fix'd  In melancholy Site with Head declin'd  And Lovedejected Eyes Sudden he starts  Shook from his tender Trance and restless runs  To glimmering Shades and sympathetic Glooms  Where the dun Umbrage o'er the falling Stream  Romantic hangs there thro' the pensive Dusk  Strays in Heartthrilling Meditation lost  Indulging all to Love or on the Bank  Thrown amid drooping Lillies swells the Breeze  With Sighs unceasing and the Brook with Tears  Thus in soft Anguish he consumes the Day  Nor quits his deep Retirement till the Moon  Peeps thro' the Chambers of the fleecy East  Enlighten'd by Degrees and in her Train  Leads on the gentle Hours then forth He walks  Beneath the trembling Languish of her Beams  With soften'd Soul and wooes the Bird of Eve  To mingle Woes with his or while the World  And all the Sons of Care lie hush'd in Sleep  Associates with the Midnight Shadows drear  And sighing to the lonely Taper pours  His sweetlytortur'd Heart into the Page  Meant for the moving Messenger of Love  But ah how faint how meaningless and poor  To what his Passion swells which bursts the Bounds  Of every Eloquence and asks for Looks  Where Fondness flows on Fondness Love on Love  Entwisting Beams with Her's and speaking more  Than ever charm'd ecstatic Poet sigh'd  To listening Beauty bright with conscious Smiles  And graceful Vanity But if on Bed  Delirious flung Sleep from his Pillow flies  All Night he tosses nor the balmy Power  In any Posture finds 'till the grey Morn  Lifts her pale Lustre on the paler Wretch  Exanimate by Love and then perhaps  Exhausted Nature sinks awhile to Rest  Still interrupted by disorder'd Dreams  That o'er the sick Imagination rise  And in black Colours paint the mimic Scene  Oft with the Charmer of his Soul he talks  Sometimes in Growds distrest or if retir'd  To secretwinding Flowerinwoven Bowers  Far from the dull Impertinence of Man  Just as He kneeling all his former Cares  Begins to lose in vast oblivious Love  Snatch'd from her yielded Hand he knows not how  Thro' Forests huge and long untravel'd Heaths  With Desolation brown he wanders waste  In Night and Tempest wrapt or shrinks aghast  Back from the bending Precipice or wades  The turbid Stream below and strives to reach  The farther Shore where succourless and sad  His Dearer Life extends her beckoning Arms  But strives in vain born by th' outragious Flood  To Distance down he rides the ridgy Wave  Or whelm'd beneath the boiling Eddy sinks  Then a weak wailing lamentable Cry  Is heard and all in Tears he wakes again  To tread the Circle of revolving Woe  These are the charming Agonies of Love  Whose Misery delights But thro' the Heart  Should Jealousy it's Venom once diffuse  'Tis then delightful Misery no more  But Agony unmixt incessant Rage  Corroding every Thought and blasting all  The Paradise of Love Ye Fairy Prospects then  Ye Beds of Roses and ye Bowers of Joy  Farewell Ye Gleamings of departing Peace  Shine out your last The yellowtinging Plague  Internal Vision taints and in a Night  Of livid Gloom Imagination wraps  Ay then instead of Loveenliven'd Cheeks  Of Sunny Features and of ardent Eyes  With flowing Rapture bright dark Looks succeed  Suffus'd and glaring with untender Fire  A clouded Aspect and a burning Cheek  Where the whole poison'd Soul malignant fits  And frightens Love away Ten thousand Fears  Invented wild ten thousand frantic Views  Of horrid Rivals hanging on the Charms  For which he melts in Fondness eat him up  With fervent Anguish and consuming Pine  In vain Reproaches lend their idle Aid  Deceitful Pride and Resolution frail  Giving a Moment's Ease Reflection pours  Afresh her Beauties on his busy Thought  Her first Endearments twining round the Soul  With all the Witchcraft of ensnaring Love  Strait the fierce Storm involves his Mind anew  Flames thro' the Nerves and boils along the Veins  While anxious Doubt distracts the tortur'd Heart  For even the sad Assurance of his Fears  Were Heaven to what he feels Thus the warm Youth  Whom Love deludes into his thorny Wilds  Thro' flowerytempting Paths or leads a Life  Of feavor'd Rapture or of cruel Care  His brightest Aims extinguish'd all and all  His lively Moments running down to Waste  BUT happy They the Happiest of their Kind  Whom gentler Stars unite and in one Fate  Their Hearts their Fortunes and their Beings blend  'Tis not the courser Tie of human Laws  Unnatural oft and foreign to the Mind  Which binds their Peace but Harmony itself  Attuning all their Passions into Love  Where Friendship fullexerts his softest Power  Perfect Esteem enliven'd by Desire  Ineffable and Sympathy of Soul  Thought meeting Thought and Will preventing Will  With boundless Confidence for nought but Love  Can answer Love and render Bliss secure  Let Him ungenerous who alone intent  To bless himself from sordid Parents buys  The loathing Virgin in eternal Care  Wellmerited consume his Nights and Days  Let barbarous Nations whose inhuman Love  Is wild Desire fierce as the Suns they feel  Let Eastern Tyrants from the Light of Heaven  Seclude their Bosomslaves meanly possest  Of a meer lifeless violated Form  While those whom Love cements in holy Faith  And equal Transport free as Nature live  Disdaining Fear for what's the World to them  It's Pomp it's Pleasure and it's Nonsense all  Who in each other clasp whatever fair  High Fancy forms and lavish Hearts can wish  Something than Beauty dearer should they look  Or on the Mind or Mindillumin'd Face  Truth Goodness Honour Harmony and Love  The richest Bounty of indulgent  Heaven  Meantime a smiling Offspring rises round  And mingles both their Graces By degrees  The human Blossom blows and every Day  Soft as it rolls along shows some new Charm  The Father's Lustre and the Mother's Bloom  Then infant Reason grows apace and calls  For the kind Hand of an assiduous Care  Delightful Task to rear the tender Thought  To teach the young Idea how to shoot  To pour the fresh Instruction o'er the Mind  To breathe th' inspiring Spirit and to plant  The generous Purpose in the glowing Breast  Oh speak the Joy You whom the sudden Tear  Surprizes often while you look around  And nothing strikes your Eye but Sights of Bliss  All various Nature pressing on the Heart  Obedient Fortune and approving  Heaven  These are the Blessings of diviner Love  And thus their Moments fly the  Seasons  thus  As ceaseless round a jarring World they roll  Still find Them happy and consenting SPRING  Sheds her own rosy Garland on their Head  Till Evening comes at last cool gentle calm  When after the long vernal Day of Life  Enamour'd more as Soul approaches Soul  Together down They sink in social Sleep  THE END  ERRATA  PAGE line for  retracted  read  refracted  p    l for  these  read  those  p l for  Flavours  read  Flowers  PROPOSALS For Printing by
