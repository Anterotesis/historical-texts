Dr  KEENE  's Sermon preach'd before the Sons of the Clergy at  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  Page    LONDON  Printed for M COOPER at the Globe in  Paternoster Row    Prince one Shilling  AN AUTHENTIC NARRATIVE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AT  CAMBRIDGE    Cam  Dec    _AS the Subject of the following Sheets has been Matter of public Discourse and the Circumstances attending it much mistaken by some and grosly misrepresented by others it is thought proper to lay before the World a plain and succinct  Narrative  of the whole Proceedings and we can assure our Readers that no material Circumstance is omitted  Saturday Nov  th being the Anniversary of Queen  Elizabeth  Fortysix Gentlemen of this University who had been educated at  Wr  School met together at the  Tuns  Tavern to commemorate their Foundress as was customary on that Day Amongst them were several  FellowCommoners  and  Fellows of Colleges  and  three Masters of Arts  one of whom Mr  Fn Gk Pssr  of the University was President The Company met between Eight and Nine o'Clock Every Thing was conducted with the utmost Decency and Sobriety and they were breaking up at Eleven when to the great Surprize of all the Gentlemen present Mr  Bn  Senior Pr of the University enter'd the Room attended by Mr  Fr  who follow'd him with the Staff What ensued the Reader will find amply discussed in the Course of these Proceedings and we shall only observe that after about twenty Minutes Stay in the Room the Company separated and retired to their respective Colleges  On the  Wednesday  following it was reported that there had been a Meeting of the  Heads  on the Occasion and that the  V C  had laid before them Mr  B  's Accusation against the whole Club and also particular Charges against  three Masters of Arts  and  two Fellow Commoners  and that in consequence of this Meeting it had been determined to summons them to the  V C  's Court on  Saturday  It was with much Difficulty that the Gentlemen concern'd could persuade themselves to give any Credit to so strange a Report as it was absurd to suppose a Matter so trifling and insignificant could so far merit the Attention of the  V C  and  Hds  and much less engage them in such violent Proceedings This Report however being confirm'd Mr  C  Mr  A  and Mr  Fn  judged it highly expedient to wait on the  V C  in order to enquire into the Particulars and at the same Time that they might have the Opportunity of justifying their Conduct to him which they accordingly did on  Thursday  Afternoon when they acquainted him with the Report that had prevailed and the Surprize with which they had heard it He assured them it was true that there had been a Meeting and that they must appear at his Court on  Saturday  They then represented to him in as modest Terms as they could make Use of that it gave them great Concern to find he had so far countenanced an Accusation not only against UnderGraduates but against Persons of Standing and Character in the University as to lay it before the  Hds  and that they could not but be of Opinion it had been more candid and humane before he proceeded so far to have heard what they had to say in Defence of their Conduct and did assure him at the same Time that if the Affair was brought before the Court if not supported it would  appear as a malicious illgrounded Prosecution and could therefore be attended with no other Consequences than to throw an Odium on the Accuser promote Animosities and Divisions in the University and only lessen that Authority which it was meant to support They desired the  V C  even then as it was certainly in his Power to make up the Matter amicably The  V C  reply'd that he had acted as his Duty required that he had received the Accusation in Form from the Pr and had laid it before the  Hds  that he could not determine it any other Way than by hearing their public Defence in Court which they were at Liberty to make that they were summoned to appear on  Saturday  and Citations were already given out for that Purpose Upon which the Gentlemen took their Leave and next Morning received as did also Mr  Ve  and Mr  Vn  their seperate Citations in Form as follows  To  Js Bgh Ts Bs  or  Ts Bt  Esqrs Beadles of the Uy of Cge or their lawful Deputy  SUmmon  Ts Fn  Master of Arts Fellow of  TyCollege  in the Uof  Cmb  and  Gk  Pr in the said Uand  Sl Cw  Master of Arts Fellow of  TyCollege  aforesaid and  Ts All  Batchelor of Laws Fellow of  TyHll  in the said Uy each of them to appear before  me at my next Court to be held in the LawSchools on  Saturday  the    th of this instant  November  between the Hours of Two and Three of the Clock in the Afternoon then and there to answer in a certain Cause of Correction and Discipline for insulting and interrupting the Reverend  Js Bn  Master of Arts Fellow of  PkeHll  Senior Pr of the said Uy in the Execution of his Office as Pr Hereof fail not at your Peril Given under my Hand  this    d Day of  November  in the Year of our Lord    EDD KE  VC  All the Gentlemen who were at the Club were also ordered to appear in Court  Nothing was now talked of in the University but the  Wr  Club the Meeting of the Hds the Summons and above all the Citation of  Mrs  of  Ats  into the  V C  's Court being a Thing extreamly unusual induced the greater part of them who were unacquainted with the Circumstances and with the Gentlemen accused to imagine that some very gross Insults had been offer'd to the Pr and some very flagrant Irregularities committed on that Night but  Saturday  came and they were quickly undeceived  At Three o'Clock the Court being met in the  LawSchools  Mr Pr was desired by the  V C  to give in his Deposition which was taken down as he spoke it by the Register  with an exact Copy of which we here present the Reader and recommend it to him as a Tract which for Matter Stile and Method cannot perhaps be easily paralelled  Saturday  Nev    "There went forth a Decree c which being returned  Js Bn  Senior Pr alleged that on  Saturday  Night last he was  insulted  and  interrupted  in the Execution of his Office at the  Wr  Club at the  Tuns  Tavern which they contested negatively  He also alleged that he was insulted by the whole Club That he received particular Affronts from one whom he  since  finds to be Mr  Vn  That he the said  Vn  behaved also very insolently at his the P's Chamber when he sent for him upon this Subject  That Mr  Ve  also behaved very indecently at his Chambers but he has no Complaint against him for any ill Behaviour at the Club in particular  That the Clock at  PeHall  had strucken Eleven before he left College in order to visit  That upon his going into the Room the Gentlemen holla'd  to the best of his Remembrance  before he spoke at all  That upon being informed there were  Masters of Arts  in Company he applied himself to Mr  Fn  and said he was come to desire that all Persons under the Degree of  Master of Arts in that Company would retire adding that it was past Eleven o'Clock  That Mr  All  said to him  with a kind of Sneer  "Mr Pr I hope you will observe that all the Company are sober"  That after Mr  All  had spoke there followed a loud Holla and a long one  That Mr  All  came up to him and said  with an Air of Triumph  "Mr Pr I hope you do not think that what I said was with a Design of getting Applause"  or  Words to that Purpose  That there were about this Time more Claps and Hollas  to the best of his Remembrance  That about this Time some of the Company began to expostulate Mr  All  in particular said It was an annual not monthly Meeting and one in particular said It was uncivil to visit on that Night and some one said It was a rigorous Execution of the Orders or  Words to that Effect  That he apply'd himself in particular at this Time to Mr Pr  Fn  and said he believed Mr Pr knew there were Orders against all Clubs in general  That Mr Pr  Fn  laughed when he attempted to shew that this was not a rigorous Execution of the Orders and said turning to some near him  "This he calls a mild Execution of his Office"  or  Words to that Purpose  That Mr  All  about this Time said  "A mild Interpretation of Orders indeed"  That at this Time there were many Claps and Hollas  That Mr  Cw  about this Time insisted that it was rude or uncivil or  Words to this Purpose  to visit when there were  Masters of Arts  in Company and one of them a Pr and asked him if he did not think them able to take Care of the young Gentlemen in the Company  That he told Mr  Cw  that it did not appear they had done so for it was now past the Time that those young Gentlemen ought to have been at home  That Mr  Cw  received particular Applause from the Company for what he had said and appeared to be much delighted with it  That Mr  Cw  insisted farther that it was strange  or Words to that Purpose  that the Execution of these Orders should be begun at the  Wr  Club  That Mr  Cw  again received the Applause of the Company by Claps and Hollas  That Mr  Cw  said farther  "We scarcely know what these Orders are which to be observed and which not"  and complained  in general Words  that it appeared some were to be executed and some not  That upon this followed again the Acclamations of the Company  That during these Disputes Mr Pssr  Fn  said two or three times  "The Pr is doing his Duty"  That he understood him to say so with a  Sneer  the first Time  That afterwards he thought that he did recollect himself and seem'd to be  serious  and that he should have continued to have thought so if he had not soon after turned into a  Rage  That Mr Pssr talked some Time and expressed a great deal of Anger and Resentment upon being interrupted by the Pr that Night  That soon after he called out  "Here's to our next merry Meeting"  which Words were twice at least repeated He added once  "without Interruption from Prs"  The Pr also alleged that during these Transactions he did observe a Gentleman in particular behave very rudely That he  heard  next Morning Mr  Ve  had behaved very ill and that he sent for him to see if he were that Gentleman and upon seeing and talking with him it appeared he was not  That on  Sunday  in the Afternoon he  heard  that Mr  Vn  had behaved very ill and from his appearing to this Time he has no Doubt but that he is the Person  That he expressed his Rudeness at the Club by laughing several Times in the Pr's Face and behaving otherwise very insolently  That he continued to shew several Marks of Rudeness  That he Mr  Vn  was going to make a Reply and the Pssr stopt him  That at his Chambers in  PeHall  he Mr  Vn  talked much of his Independency upon being accused of his ill Behaviour  That he asked in particular if it was the Custom of this Place to interrupt Gentlemen at their Meetings  That upon telling him it was the Custom to interrupt them at those unseasonable Hours he said  with a Sneer  that then he was instructed in what he did not know before or  Words to that Purpose  and said he did not value what the Unty could do to him or  Words to that Purpose  That upon being told he had laughed often in his the Pr's Face he said in a very contemptuous Manner that really he could not help those natural Emotions  That he said farther that his Clappings and Hollaings were not meant as an Affront to him the Pr but an Approbation of what Pssr  Fn  had said  That upon the whole he did not shew any Signs whereby he might think himself secured from the like Treatment again  That upon talking with Mr  Ve  he found he was not the Person That he talked to him the Pr that he had no Dependence  upon the Uy and did not value what might be done to him or  Words to that Purpose  That he said his Laughings and Clappings and Hollaings were not designed as an Affront to him the Pr but an Approbation of Mr Pssr  Fn  That he thought that every Thing that Gentleman said was so perfectly right that he could not help applauding it or  Words to that Purpose  That he said farther he understood it was the Custom for several Gentlemen to stay on that Night 'till Twelve o'Clock and that for his Part he had determined to stay 'till the last  About the middle of this Deposition it growing dark the Court was by the  V C  adjorned to the  SenateHouse  when Mr  Pr  proceeded and finish'd it as above  Mr  Pr  having finish'd his Deposition the  V C  said he believed the Defences of the Gentlemen accused must be deferr'd 'till another Day it growing very late To this Mr Pssr  Fn  assented but Mr  All  having prepared his Defence desired he might be permitted to make it immediately To which the  V C  agreeing Mr  All  spoke as follows  Mr  V C  IN a very public and unprecedented Manner I appear before you accused of Irregularity and Insult to the Pr in the Execution of his Office  It is indeed a very general Accusation and as it is of a criminal Nature it ought according to the established and universal Practice of all Courts of Justice to be most literally and demonstrably proved A few Facts have been mention'd to support the Charge of which some have been particularly alleged against myself In the Course of my Defence therefore I shall endeavour to obviate the Facts Notwithstanding it is my sincere Opinion I could evince to the Audience that even if they were true yet nevertheless that they could by no means if candidly interpreted according to the concomitant Circumstances and Occasion be justly said to amount to an Insult on Authority But as your Judgment I hope will be impartially formed upon the Truth of Evidence and a due Regard to the Merits of our Cause I cannot but greatly rejoice that so many of the  Wr  Scholars were then present to attest what I shall assert and that so many Members of the Uy are now present to bear Witness of our Vindication  To digest as well as I can and methodize my Defence I shall submit it to your Consideration in the following Order  First  I shall state to you very faithfully according to the best of my Memory the Behaviour both of the Pr and the Club upon our CommemorationNight for upon this the whole of the Accusation is founded  Secondly  I shall enlarge upon the Circumstances and expressly account for my own Conduct upon that Occasion  Lastly  Mr  V C  I shall entreat your Indulgence that I may mention to this Audience the Proceedings subsequent to and consequent of the Pr's Visit  It has been a constant Custom among the Scholars educated at  Wr  to celebrate the th of  November  as the Anniversary of Queen  Elizabeth  who was Foundress of their School for which Reason last  Saturday  Night a numerous Meeting of were assembled There is no Necessity for me to take Notice of any Thing which passed before the Pr's Visit except only that before his coming we had called for our Bill had collected our Reckoning and should have departed before his Entrance if there had not been an accidental Omission in the Bill and a Miscomputation of what should be given to the Waiters and Servants and that it was on account of this Deficiency we were retarded 'till the Waiter could collect Sixpence apiece more from the Members He was ordered to do it with Dispatch in the mean Time we were desired by the President to drink a concluding Toast to Dr  Nls  's Health  It was at this Crisis that the Pr came in without Notice and with so little Ceremony that I knew not of his Presence 'till I saw him  near me at the upper end of the Room He came very abruptly to the Head of the Table and told us it was an irregular Hour and ordered us to depart Upon this a Silence ensued and there seem'd to be a general Amazement It was then Mr  V C  I address'd myself to him to inform him of the Occasion of our Meeting  "That it was to commemorate the Foundationday of our School and I observed to him that we were just going to depart If he would consider therefore the Occasion and the Hour he would not charge us with Irregularity And I further told him that since he had taken the unusual Pains to visit us I requested him to do us the Justice to remark the Sobriety and good Order of our Members and to report it accordingly to their Reputation"  These were as near as I can now recollect my very Words The Members applauded me by clapping of their Hands The Pr thereupon said he thought that was Insult to him Upon which I reply'd I am persuaded Sir that you misinterpret the Applause of the Company for it is meant I believe to signify their Approbation of what I said in Vindication of the Occasion of our Meeting and of the Regularity of it And I assured him I did not mean by what I had said to encourage Disobedience to his Authority He seem'd satisfied with my Answer and told me he was not offended with it Mr Pssr  Fn  next spoke to him and told him that  our Reckoning was just collected Bill ready for Payment on the Table and that we were going to drink to Dr  Nls  's Health before we departed He remonstrated too against the Incivility of visiting him without Notice as he was  A M  Mr  Cw  next spoke upon the Point of not paying a customary Regard to their Degree At the End of each of their Speeches there ensued a general Applause It was then proposed to drink the Toast and go Mr  Fn  Mr  Cw  and myself advising them to obey the Company shew'd a very ready Obedience to the Advice We immediately left the Room and withdrew to our respective Colleges Nor do I yet hear of any personal Affront or Injury which was then offered to the Pr  Having thus as briefly as possible informed you of the Facts I shall  Secondly  enlarge upon the Circumstances which will explain those Facts And by more thoroughly acquainting you with the Motives shall enable you to judge more equitably upon their Merits  The Motives to commemorate a Founder's Day are indisputably grounded upon a generous and laudable Principle of Gratitude and are authorized by many such solemn Festivals observed in every College and in all Societies where Piety to Patrons is preserved The Uses and Advantages of SchoolAnniversaries are certainly commendable as they tend to cultivate  and improve those most disinterested Friendships contracted in our Youth And if I am not deceived I speak this with great Deference to your Office even you Mr  V C  have formerly expressed your Sense and Approbation of these greatful Commemorations by your Presence at the Anniversaries of the Charterhouse School This I mention with great Deference to you Sir but as it seems to be much in Point Selfdefence obliges me to take Notice of it  It being confessed therefore that our Meeting was originally at least not culpable it follows then that some AfterAct must be proved to make it so But no such AfterAct does appear upon Evidence For what has been pretended if culpable has been very weakly objected and not at all supported by the Complainant Was there any Intemperance Was there any personal Injury or Affront offer'd to Mr  Bn  None is suggested He only says in general that as Pr he was insulted Had it the Appearance of an irregular Meeting where a Pfr was President and so many Fellows of Colleges were his Associates Can it so properly be said to be a Club as a solemn Anniversary which is allow'd even to our younger Brethren at the School Can any Irregularity be justly imputed to us I am conscious there will be none I am conscious you will be convinced Mr  V C  that none can be imputed when you have given me leave to explain  at large the only Fact which seems to affect us  "That we had not left the Room at Eleven"  altho' it is most certainly true that we were about to depart when the Pr came in Let it b  remember'd that our Bill and Reckoning were ready on the Table so much in readiness to be paid that it was only delayed while the Deficiency of the Miscalculation and first Collection was to be made good by a small Addition and while the concluding Health of Dr  Nls  our Master was to be drank Be it known to you that some of the Members were just gone many were then going and I think it is more than probable that the whole Company at least the UnderGraduates would at that Time have been retired to their proper Colleges if it had not been incumbent upon the Seniors at the Table to desire them with as much Dispatch as possible to make good the Defect of the Reckoning by contributing something more At this instant without any Notice given without so much as a Message to Mr  Fn  Master of Arts Pfr and our President the Pr entred But so false is his Deposition of a general Shout and Confusion that I most solemnly declare I did not know he was in the Room 'till I saw him near me at the upper End of the Table Neither can I recollect any Confusion so remarkable at that Time as his own which I take Notice of here because I think it in some degree material as it must invalidate the Credit of his Report  and as it may in some measure account for the Inconsistency of his Accusation against us So insensible and ignorant was I of his Presence that when I saw the whole Company rise up from their Chairs I thought it was either to drink the Toast for this Ceremony is observed among us in public Healths or to depart  So false is the Charge of a general Outcry or Hallooing before he spoke or afterwards that I solemnly declare an universal Silence ensued upon his Speech And that the Silence and the Consternation which prevailed over the whole Company excited me to vindicate and exempt them from his Aspersion of Irregularity  When you reflect Mr  V C  upon this Situation of the Members and the manifest Suspence they were in you will not be offended that I should inform the Pr of the extraordinary Occasion of our Meeting and that we were about to depart or that I should desire him to observe to the Reputation of the Club it's singular Sobriety and Decency It must be a most rigid Interpretation of my Words to extort an Expression of Insolence from them and it is a very unjust Insinuation that they were spoke with Derision The Pr did not so understand them for when I afterwards attempted to satisfy him of the Reason of the Applause which followed them he confessed to me he was not offended with what I had  said A strange Confession if it had been true that I had spoke to him with an Air of Triumph  When I had thus with much Submission and am conscious without a Sneer made this Representation to him an Applause ensued which he misconceived to be an intended Insolence to him as Pr I again therefore addressed myself to him to assure him that he misinterpreted the Meaning of it and that he should find a ready Obedience to his Authority  Yet before I conclude this Part of my Defence I shall more directly obviate the Pr's Objection That I spoke to him with a Sneer and an Air of Triumph These Words seem to be an Embellishment and rhetorically thrown in to inflame and to support an Accusation which wanted such Assistance But I answer plainly That I was not guilty of such irreverent Behaviour and I think the Pr himself on a better Recollection acquits me of it for he now confesses in Court that he then told me  "He was not offended with what I had said to him"  How repugnant to each other are the Charge and the Confession Moreover Mr  V C  I cannot but now think I might safely have submitted my own Conduct to your Judgment even upon the very Words of the Accusation if the Pr had not invented that supplemental Improvement upon the Manner in which I uttered them But as  this Aggravation is insisted on I positively deny the Truth of it and his AfterConfession will give Credit to my Negation  If this will not satisfy you Sir it must rest on our Credibility and Characters or the Testimony of the Company Yet I shall add an Observation which may induce you to believe me It is That if you consider the Words laid to my Charge you will not find them to be indecent or scurrilous or of that Nature that would require me to make use of a Sneer or an Air of Triumph  "The Pr too has told you that I did not appear to be pleased with the Applauses as Mr  Cw  seemed to be"  The Crotchet was not spoke in Court but delivered in to the  V C  afterwards  Does not this Acknowlegement imply a Contradiction to the Air of Triumph Remember therefore Mr  V C  that as this Accusation is of the Nature of a Criminal Profecution it ought to be quash'd and annulled if it be either uncertain or too general more especially if the chief Matter in Charge is not fully verified  Thus far relates to myself and I have the Confidence now to expect that my Conduct on the Occasion will appear rather commendable than culpable for the Pr cannot but do me the Justice to confess that I recommended an Obedience to him  Next as an Evidence ⁂{inverted ⁂}⁂{inverted ⁂}⁂  Here I was interrupted from giving my Attestation  to the Behaviour of my Associates But the  V C  indulged me to relate the following Fact as a Proof of the Respect always paid by the Prs to A M so far as not to visit where they are in Company    It is incumbent upon me to take Notice of the Remonstrance made by Mr  Fn  against the Pr's Incivility of not regarding him as Gentlemen of his Degree had ever been respected by the Magistrates of the Uy And what especially induces me tho' not honoured with the same Degree to speak upon this Subject is that I can quote an Instance to confirm this customary Deference from a Visit at the  Tuns  where I was present It was in the Moderatorship of Mr  Rss  who one Night in the Execution of his Office came into the Room where a Master of Arts of  Kg  's  College  and myself were at Supper But Mr  Rss  altho' a noted Disciplinarian was so sensible of the Incivility which he had committed that on the next Day he made an Apology to me and assured me that his coming into the Room where a Master of Arts was in Company had been occasioned by the Waiter's Neglect of informing him who were there  Give me leave now Mr  V C  to mention in few Words the Procedings subsequent to and consequent of the Pr's Visit  Common Report had informed me that some of the UnderGraduates had been sent for by  the Pr I heard afterwards that he had sent for and demanded a List of Names And it was told me that you Sir had consulted the  Hds  upon this Subject of the Visit to the  Wrs  Yet 'till I waited upon you at your Lodge on  Thursday  I did not know that any Information had been offered against Mr  Fn  Mr  Cw  or myself neither did I know that my Reputation had been called in Question before an Assembly of the  Hds  When therefore you acquainted me with the Information Consultation and Citation for me to appear in Court before you I could not but be greatly astonished at the seeming Impropriety of your receiving an Accusation reporting it again to others and countenancing the Charge so much as to summon us to answer in Court before you had in the least enquired what might be shewn as Cause why the Information should not be granted at all  This Proceeding Mr  V C  however it may be authorized by the Power of your Office was nevertheless contrary to a fundamental Rule of the Civil Law which ought I believe in a great Measure to direct this Court The Rule is  Non debet Actore licere quod Reo non permittitur  Dig lib Tit l  It is a Rule of Equity and Reason and should especially be admitted here where the Power of the Judge seems to be so unlimited You told us in Answer That you was obliged to  receive the Information and that for your own Assistance you had consulted the  Hds  I do not question this I only contend that it would have been more candid and humane if you had allowed us a Hearing before your Report to the  Hds  For how faithfully soever you might repeat the  Pr  's Accusation yet certainly you was liable to a wrong Impression for want of regarding the well known and just Maxim  Audi alteram partem  Much more were the  Hds  liable to receive a wrong Impression of the Merits of our Cause from it's being received by a  V C  and so far countenanced as to be thought worthy of a Consultation upon it  You told us indeed Sir that this should in no wise prejudice our Cause I must beg Leave to reply that it has already been very prejudicial to us And altho' I have the Confidence to hope that none of our Judges will suffer such an Impression to mislead them into a Praejudication of the Case before them yet the Citation itself is a Punishment much too severe for the Offence if in Truth any Offence could be made to appear Strangers to the Facts will conclude from the very Nature of such an extraordinary Citation that it implies some Guilt And it certainly subjects us 'till the Hour of Trial to the Reflections of the Uy before they are enabled to judge truly on the Facts and Merits It is well known to this Audience Facts of this kind gather Falsehood in Report  and that Fame especially an illnatured Fame encreases as she flies Many of these false Rumours have come to my own Hearing and several of them relative to myself nay the Accusation itself is a false Imputation For which Cause I am glad of this Opportunity to contradict them before so full an Assembly of the whole Uy Nevertheless as this Citation has hitherto given some Countenance to such Reports I cannot but think it a Hardship that I was not indulged with a Hearing before Mr  V C  had so far given a kind of Sanction to the Calumny  But if I esteem this as an Hardship upon myself there is much more Reason to consider it as an Injustice to Mr  Fn  a Gentleman of an unblemished Reputation a Master of Arts Fellow of a College and of distinguished Honour in the Uy Yet not the common Civilities due to his Degree have been shown him by the Pr and this is undoubtedly an Affront to the whole Body of  A M  no Respect has been paid him as a Pfr nor the common Practice observed of hearing him before the Report or so much as Notice given to him or any of us of the Proceedings against us For I am well assured that 'till I accompany'd them to the  V C  's on  Thursday  noon neither the Pfr nor Mr  Cw  had been spoke to upon this Subject by any of the Magistrates notwithstanding natural Equity seemed to require that we should have been  invited to answer Mr  Bn  's Objections or apprized of them at least before they were referred to a Consultation of the Hds These are known Rules in Courts of Equity and Civil Law  Favorabiliores Rei potius quam Actores habentur  Dig l Reg  In paenalibus causis benignius interpretandum est  Reg  And certainly Mr  V C  if ever it was reasonable to regard this Doctine  Favores ampliandi Odia vero restinguenda sunt  it now seems most remarkably so when the notorious Divisions among ourselves already furnish our Enemies with so much Cause of Triumph against us But to receive in such Manner an illfounded Accusation against the Members of so great a School as  Wr  does not seem to be a probable Method of reconciling Dissentions or extinguishing the Flames which already prevail too much Excuse me Sir for this Observation for the Nature of my Defence led me to it imperceptibly  After all this singular and severe Proceeding against us does it appear that we have deserved any Severity or Censure at all Quite the Reverse And I am persuaded upon an unprejudiced Enquiry into the Truth of the Case it will be evident we have merited other Usage Our President especially instead of this criminal  Citation has deserved a better Treatment and I cannot but think that instead of such a Censure the Thanks of the whole Assembly are justly due to him  Gratitude and your Regard to Discipline should exact them from you Mr  V C  and the  Hds  of Colleges for preserving so great a Sobriety and Temperance among forty young Gentlemen met to celebrate a Festival and revive their Friendships For it must be imputed to his Preeminence and a Deference to his Rank as well as his Example that so much Order Decency and Regularity were maintained in so numerous a Meeting Thanks are due to him ⁂{inverted ⁂}⁂{inverted ⁂}⁂{inverted ⁂}  Here I was again interrupted and desired to confine myself to the Defence of my own Conduct in Obedience to which Injunction I was obliged to proceed as follows without a proper Connection    Before my Conclusion I shall recapitulate the Facts and subjoin a succinct Answer to the Charge against myself  It is most materially worthy your Consideration Mr  V C  to remember that it struck Eleven while the Pr was in the Yard that when he came into the Room which he did without any previous Notice he found the Reckoning just collected and the Bill lying on the Table for immediate Payment that we were drinking a concluding Toast to Dr  Ns  's Health and that it was really owing  to an accidental Miscalculation and to the Difficulty of collecting the Money from so many Members that we were retarded so long And I may venture to assure you that I believe the whole Company would immediately have dispersed to their respective Colleges after drinking to the Doctor's Health if they had not been so  unseasonably  I must call it  visited  In regard to myself Mr  V C  I do not find any Thing else alleged against me but that I spoke to the Pr with a kind of Sneer when he so abruptly charged us with Irregularity and ordered us to departThat expostulating with him I said it was an Annual and not a Monthly Meeting and that I told him with  an Air of Triumph  "Mr Pr I hope you do not think that what I said was with a Design of getting Applause"  My first Speech to him as I have before repeated it was intended only to wipe away the Aspersion of Irregularity and to vindicate the Reputation of the Company by representing to him with Deference to his Authority the solemn Occasion of our Meeting and requesting him to remark the general Sobriety of all that were present and to report it accordingly My other Speech for which I am here reponsible was intended to undeceive the Pr in his misconceived Opinion and Suspicion that the Applause was meant as an Insolence to him and I endeavoured to convince  him in very few Words of his Misinterpretation of it  As to the Allegation that I spoke with a  Sneer  or  Air of Triumph  it seems to be inserted only to induce you to believe he had some Foundation for an Accusation against me for without that Addition I am sure there is none But I positively answer to this Part of the Charge that it is not true  Upon the whole therefore Mr  V C  and  Hds  I hope this very faithful Explanation of my Conduct and the Motives of it will sufficiently satisfy you that I never intended any Insult against the Pr in the Execution of his Office and I most solemnly declare to you that I am not yet conscious to myself of having committed any Offence against his Authority But on the contrary I am very conscious that my Behaviour has in no wise deserved these Proceedings against me for the whole Company will bear me Witness that I recommended it to them to obey the Pr and depart  Upon this I shall rest my Defence and submit it to your Judgment reminding you of an equitable Maxim that if there should be any Difference of Sentiments among you  Inter dispares Sententias Mitior vincat  P S  When I had ended speaking the above Defence the Pr made a severe Observation That there was no Reason to  conclude the Company was like to depart because the Reckoning was collected But such a Construction of our Intentions with so improbable a Conjecture betrayed a malevolent Desire to insinuate Irregularity where he could not prove anyI replied therefore to the following Purpose That such a Fact was at least a strong Presumption in our Favour and that it had ever been admitted Probable Presumptions on the favourable Side were always allowed as tantum non Proofs  Mr  All  having finished his Speech no Part of which did at that Time seem to give any Offence to the  V C  or the  Hds  the Court was adjourned to  Tuesday  the th of  November  at in the Morning  Here it may not be amiss to inform the Reader that the latter Part of the Pr's Deposition was given in and Mr  All  's Defence spoke not in the  LawSchools  from whence the Court had adjourned on Account of it's growing dark but in the  Theatre  where the younger Part of the Uy took the Advantage as might indeed easily have been foreseen of their Distance from the Court below they being in the Galleries to express with Freedom their Sense of the Proceedings and they accordingly took the Liberty to laugh at the Plaintiff hiss the Judge and applaud the Defendant and that in so tumultuous a Manner that it was with the utmost  Difficulty they were persuaded to Silence and Attention To prevent those Disorders from being repeated Sixteen  ProPrs  were appointed for the  Tuesday  following with full Power to punish with the utmost Severity any who should disturb the Proceedings  Things being thus settled the Court met again on  Tuesday  at in the Morning when Mr Pfr  Fn  before he entered on his Defence desired the Pr might be sworn but this he was informed by the  V C  and  Hds  was not the Custom of that Court It was said that the Pr had taken an Oath on entering into his Office which was sufficient but he might nevertheless be upon Oath if he thought proper Whereupon Mr  Fn  asked him if he chose to be sworn which he  modestly  refused  In omnibus Licentia comedenda est ei cui onus probationis incumbit Adversario suo de rei veritate jusjurandum inferre ipso prius pro calumnia jurante ut Judex juramenti fidem secutus ita possit sententiam formare jure religionis referendae ei servando  Dig  Mr Pfr  Fn  's Defence  Dr  Ge Pt  of  Ks  College formerly Master of  En  School endeavoured before Mr Pfr  Fn  began his Defence to intimidate him by observing that Mr  All  's Defence was a seditious Harangue and very affrontive to the  V C  and he would not advise Mr  Fn  to speak in the same Manner and while Mr  Fn  spoke he frequently interrupted him found Fault with the Position of his Body and told him to turn more to the  V C  and not talk to the Uy rebuked him for treating the Pr's Character with Contempt and all this with that high Degree of Politeness Urbanity and Softness of Manners for which he is so eminently distinguished  spoke in the Law Schools Nov    Mr  V C  and Gentlemen of the Court  I Am summoned to appear before you in this Court to answer for insulting and interrupting the Pr in the Execution of his  Office on  Saturday November  the th at the  Wr  Club Great Surprize I must confess to you I feel on this Occasion and still greater Anxiety for little indeed did I expect after so many Years Standing after so long a Time passed with a Character blameless and irreproachable after having just received that Dignity from the Uty which how unworthy soever I may be I now stand possessed of little did I expect that after all I should be cited to appear in this public Manner and called upon to answer for my Illbehaviour Very unworthy Mr  V C  should I account myself of that Dignity and very ungrateful to those who conferred it upon me were I capable of doing that which is laid to my Charge of flying in the Face of Authority of insulting and interrupting a superior Magistrate in the Execution of his Office  That Masters of Arts Fellows of Colleges Gentlemen of Character and Reputation in this Body should be thus cited is I believe Mr  V C  you will yourself acknowlege a Thing pretty unusual I cannot therefore but  be of Opinion that in such a Case the Facts alleged ought to be of a very extraordinary Nature and the Proofs of them extreamly well supported  I shall be more sollicitous Mr  V C  in my Defence and in Defence of those Gentlemen who are accused with me because I think the Honour of that School and Foundation from whence we came the Honour of that Senate to which we belong and of that Uy of which we are Members are all of them most nearly and intimately concerned in the Event The Dignity Weight and Authority of a Pr ought undoubtedly to be strenuously supported but at the same Time I am satisfied that a due Deference and Regard is to be paid to those of an inferior Rank To put  M A  on the same Footing with UnderGraduates to subject them to the same Restraint in every Word and Action this Mr  V C  is to level all Degrees throw down all Distinction and introduce Disorder and Confusion in the Uy  Mr  All  has already made his Defence and a very excellent one it was that has sufficiently refuted every Thing laid to his Charge and withal stated the general Facts in a true Light explained the Cause of our Meeting and shewn the great Order and Regularity with which every Thing was conducted  Never indeed I believe did so large and numerous an Assembly meet where more Decency and Sobriety were maintained than at  that where I had the Honour to preside To us Mr  V C  I will beg leave to observe this Decency and Sobriety might be in some Measure owing and we therefore rather expected from the Officers of the Uy those Thanks we endeavoured to merit than that Censure which we apparently meant to avoid  It is but Justice to the young Gentlemen concerned in this Accusation to acknowlege that their Behaviour on this Occasion was worthy the Place of their Education worthy of that School to which we have been indebted for so many great and good Men to which our noble and most worthy  Chlor  did himself belong and which he has so long patronized and protected a School in short to which we owe such Men as always have been now are and I trust always will be an Honour and an Ornament to this Uy  And yet Mr  V C  these are the Gentlemen who have created all this Disturbance by these the Pr was insulted and interrupted and we are represented as Abettors of an Action we were not capable of committing as Encouragers of a Design to which we were absolute Strangers How illsupported that Part of the Accusation is which relates to Mr  All  has already appeared that what is alleged also against myself stands on no better Foundation I shall now endeavour Mr  V C  most fully to convince you  But before I enter upon this there is one Thing which I must beg Leave to take Notice of and that is that in a Cause of so serious and important a Nature for such it is to us against so many Gentlemen of Honour and Reputation the whole is supported by the single Testimony of a Person who has all along acknowleged himself to have been during his whole Stay in the Club Room in such Confusion and Perplexity as not to know what he said or did as will indeed be sufficiently evident when you hear the Articles of his Deposition the inconceivable Falsehood and Absurdity of which I shall be obliged to expose in Vindication of my own Conduct  Omitting therefore those Articles which regard particular Persons I shall consider only those which have Respect to the general Behaviour and remain unanswered and those which concern myself These I shall lay before you and confute in their Order distinctly and separately  First then Mr  V C  for Mr Pr's first Article Mr Pr asserts that  "upon going into the Room the Gentlemen halloo'd  to the best of his Remembrance  before he spoke at all"  The Gentlemen halloo'd he says before he spoke at all this is his first  AQuale principium dedit  It has always been look'd upon as an ill Omen to stumble at the Threshold The first Thing he sets out with is absolutely  and directly false and to prove this I beg that Mr  Wish  according to his own Desire may be brought into Court and sworn  which he accordingly was and being asked whether on his going up with the  Pr  he remembered any Hallooing at his Entrance he said no and that the first Noise he heard which was a Clapping was about five Minutes afterwards below Stairs Mr  Fr  also a Gentleman who attended the  Pr  to carry his Staff and was in the Room all the Time was sworn and said he remembered no such Noise till after Mr  A  had spoke  Here Mr  V C  is as ample Testimony as can be produced against Mr  Pr  's Evidence upon which I shall beg Leave to make this Observation  That in all Courts of Judicature as I have been informed by Mr  A  and several other Lawyers where many Articles are alleged if any one of those Articles is fairly proved to be absolutely and incontestibly false the whole Prosecution drops to the Ground But perhaps it may be still better to prove every Article as false as the first which may be done with the same Ease for he goes on just as he begins  Ab ovo usque ad mala  for Example  Article the  Second  says That upon being informed there were Masters of Arts in Company  he applied himself to Mr  Fn and said he was come to desire that all Persons under the Degree of Master of Arts in that Company  would retire adding that it was past Eleven o'Clock  This Mr  V C  is just as true as the former for Mr  Pr  made the Speech he here mentioned without any Application to me However it is matter of no Moment whether he did or not as I apprehend what he only said  to  me cannot possibly be a Charge  against  me  I proceed therefore to another Article and a pretty remarkable one it is that  "about this Time  some  of the Company began to expostulate  one  in particular said it was uncivil to visit that Night  some one  said it was a rigorous Execution of the Orders or  Words to that Purpose"  "  This Mr  V C  is a most astonishing unprecedented Way of laying an Allegation such a vague and undeterminate Method as not only proves but asserts Nothing and would be sufficient to quash any Charge in any Court whatever  About this Time  Mr  Pr  says but about what Time we must guess  some  of the Company began to expostulate but in regard to  who  they were we are again left in the Dark  one  in particular said it was uncivil  some one  said it was a rigorous Execution Is not this the strangest most perplexed Affair a Story of I don't know what said by I don't know who But the Absurdity of it is sufficiently evident and it would be only Loss of Time to endeavour  to contradict  what it is impossible  to understand  The next Article therefore which I shall take Notice of is this that  "Mr Pfr  Fn  laughed when he the Pr attempted to shew that this was not a rigorous Execution of the Orders and said turning to some near him This he calls a mild Execution of his Office"  and concludes with his usual Salvo  "  or Words to this Purpose  "  Now Mr  V C  as to the first Part of this Article I shall not contest a Smile with him as it is very probable one might be raised by Mr  P  's boasting his great Indulgence Every UnderGraduate is enjoined to leave Taverns at Eleven Now it had just struck Eleven by some Clocks by others it had not when the Pr came Had he come half an Hour after indeed he might have expected less Company there but as it happened he was but a Minute or two on the right Side of Authority and consequently could have no great Merit to plead on that Hdea But in regard to the latter Part of this Article it is absolutely false I never did say  this he calls a mild Execution of his Office  This perhaps might be said by some of the Company but I solemnly declare it was not said by me nor any Words to that Purpose and this I will testify on Oath if required and I believe all the Gentlemen then present are ready to do the same  Surely Mr  V C  to confound Personages to put Speeches into one Man's Mouth which came out of another's to falsify and equivocate  in this Manner to subject Gentlemen to all this Trouble and Uneasiness on such weak Foundations is unjust and ungenerous You will please to observe he would exculpate himself from absolute Falshood by the Salvos thrown into most of the Articles such as  Words to this Purpose  and  to the best of his Remembrance  Whether what he asserts is to the best of his Remembrance or not it is impossible for me to determine but I am certain if so it be his Memory is of a very peculiar and extraordinary Nature for he has hitherto been so unfortunate as to  remember  nothing but that which was  never  said  But to proceed In the Deposition Mr  V C  you will find the following very curious Article that  "during these Disputes Mr Pfr said two or three Times The Pr is doing his Duty that he understood him to say so with a  Sneer  the first Time that afterwards he thought that he did recollect himself and seem to be  serious  and lastly that he should have continued to have thought so if he had not soon after turned into a  Rage  "  Here Mr  V C  is another Instance of Mr Pr's amazing Exactness and Perspicuity in the Delivery of his Charge First you see it was said with a  Sneer  then it was said without a  Sneer  and then it was said with a  Sneer  again He should have thought I had been  serious  he says but that I turned into a  Rage  Now for my Part I cannot help thinking but that  most People who are in a  Rage  are  serious  tho' it does indeed sometimes happen that Men are very  serious  and very  angry  too on very trifling and insignificant Occasions as is evident from the whole Course of this Prosecution However to cut short the Matter now in Dispute whether what I said was with a Sneer or without a Sneer in a Passion or out of a Passion I declare I never said it at all It was what indeed by my Behaviour I expressed and that most  seriously  all the Time and the Gentlemen present will bear me Witness that I desired them all several Times as did also Mr  Cw  and Mr  All  not to insult or interrupt the Pr  Mr Pr goes on to assert that  "Mr Pfr talked some Time and expressed a great deal of  Anger  and  Resentment  upon being interrupted by the Pr that Night"  Mr Pfr he says talk'd some TimeOne would really imagine by the Number of the Things alleged and the Pr's Manner of relating them that he had spent at least two Hours in the Room tho' the Truth is he was there but twenty Minutes in the whole and in that Space it is impossible half the Things with the Answers Replies c which he talks of could be said But he goes on to assert that  I expressed a great deal of Anger and Resentment  and he had told you before that  I was in a Rage  Men in a  Rage  Mr  V C  inflamed with  Anger  and  Resentment  are apt to throw out very harsh and cutting Things and which when they are cool they are very sorry for but I don't hear that Mr Pr has any such to produce against me and I have no Reason to suppose that if I had said them they would have escaped his Observation I would therefore infer Mr  V C  that I could be in no very  great Passion  I am sure if I was it was the most  fortunate Passion  I ever was in in all my Life That I expressed some  Resentment  at his coming I shall not deny but on the contrary do still assert that I had Reason so to do I do not dispute nor did I then his Right to visit at any Time or Place but I remonstrated to him that it was very unusual to visit on that Night and withal that when Masters of Arts were in Company more Respect was always paid to them This Mr  V C  is indisputable Mr Pr should have sent up to us Mr  Wish  desired him to do so but he would not Mr  All  gave you a remarkable Instance of the Respect paid to our Degree and I could give you several were it necessary to our Defence There were Masters of Arts there were UnderGraduates in the House at that Time but nobody was visited nobody taken Notice of but the  Wr  Club  Mr  V C  I insist upon it the Honour of the Senate ought to be supported but if the Members of it are to be brought into a Court in  this Manner on every trifling Occasion if a Look a Laugh a Smile shall subject  them  to Censure and Punishment how shall the younger Part of the Uy be induced to pay them that Deference and Regard which is due to their Station I protest for my own Part I shall for the future never expect it  One Article more and we have done Mr Pr deposeth that  "Mr Pfr called out  here's to our next merry Meeting  which Words were twice at least repeated he added once  without Interruption from  Prs"  To our next merry Meeting  Mr  V C  was certainly the Health and a very innocent Health it is In what follows Mr Pr has indulged himself in his usual Licence of adding Words which were never spoke  Here you will please to observe every Thing is positively asserted It is not  Words to this Purpose  or  to the best of my Remembrance  but the whole is confidently attested Now we do as confidently attest that the Health as related by the Pr was not drunk  Mr  Fr  the Gentleman who attended the Pr being asked if he heard any Toast proposed answered in the Affirmative  viz  "To our next merry Meeting and that he believed the Words  without Interruption  c were added by  somebody  but he could not say  who  "  In Matters Mr  V C  where every Thing must depend on Words as related by the  Plaintiff  the utmost Caution should be used because the Addition of a single Word nay a single Syllable may entirely change the State  of the Case in Question and I have known a Cause of a criminal Nature laid aside merely on Account of the misspelling of a Name Mr  V C  you must allow that if an Accuser has the Liberty of adding or taking away Words at his Pleasure there is nothing which can be said but may very easily be proved actually to have been said and consequently in such a Case no Justice can be expected  And now Mr  V C and Gentlemen of the Court  I have as briefly as I could answered those Parts of the general Charge which might be thought to remain unconfuted and withal every Article separately which related to myself and I make no Doubt but that Things have now quite another Face than when partially and imperfectly represented to you Had I been apprehensive I was before Men whose Minds were tainted by Prejudice or who would have wrested any Thing to my future Disadvantage I should not have spoken with that Openness and Freedom which I have ventured to make use of But I hope I speak to Men unbiassed and uninfluenced You Mr  V C  have indulged us in a free Liberty of Defence and given us a fair and equitable Hearing The same Candour with which you have hitherto acted in the Course of these Proceedings we also expect in your Determination of them You have seen how little after all is alleged against us how very small a Part of that little has been at all supported and  that not one single Article against myself proved you see that the whole Deposition is perplexed and confused and you will be pleased to remember that your Judgment must rest on the Proof of the Facts there alleged and on that only  The Statutes Mr  V C  and  Assessors  are the Laws by which we are to be judged but those Statutes you have yourselves the Power to interpret A very great and a very extensive Power it is and which ought indeed to be lodged in the Hands of none but Men of the strictest Honour and Integrity Conscience Tenderness and Humanity On that Honour that Integrity and Humanity we firmly and willingly rest our Cause You will consider Mr  V C  the Characters of the Gentlemen concerned how grievously they have already suffered and how unjustly by this Accusation You will consider that the Censure of an Uy is no light or easy Punishment and that it will not be confined within these Walls Reputation Mr  V C  is a tender Point and by no means to be blemished on every slight Occasion It is on that our good or ill Success in future Life must depend and if you take it from us it will not be in your Power to give it us again  I know it has been said by many that the Honour of the Uy is concerned to support a Pr and so it is also Mr  V C  to  support it's Pfrs it's Masters of Arts it's Scholars and every Member of it but not to support either of them of what Rank or Degree soever in Falshood in malicious illgrounded Prosecutions nor to support them against Truth and against Conviction  I believe Mr  V C  every one here sees and none I hope with greater Pleasure than yourself that I am entirely innocent If I have been obliged to expose the Absurdities Perplexity and Confusion of Mr  Bn  's Evidence it was what I could by no Means avoid It was an illfounded groundless Accusation and therefore he deserved it He was dissuaded from the Prosecution by many but persisted and if the Odium consequent on such Behaviour be general I cannot help it  To your Determination therefore Mr  V C  and  Assessors  we submit our Cause and from you we hope all the Amends which can now be made us to be honouraby cleared but this must be left to your own Breast  In the mean Time we shall all of us have the noblest Testimony of our Innocence we shall have what is infinitely preferable to the favourable Decision of all the Courts in the Universe we shall have the silent Applause of our own Consciences to support we shall have the unanimous Voice of all good honest and reasonable Men to acquit us  Mr  Fn  having finished his Defence Mr  Cw  address'd the  V C  as follows  Mr  V C  and Gentlemen of the Court  THE general Behaviour of the  Wr  Club on the th Instant and particularly that of the presiding Members has now been so clearly explained and the Facts alleged against us by Mr Pr so fully answered that I should greatly infringe upon that Time which to every Member of this Place dedicated to private Study must be so precious should I detain the Court by attempting to enlarge upon what has been already so well urged in behalf of our Conduct  But I hope it will not be taken amiss if before I proceed to the Defence of my own Behaviour and to answer that Part of the general Accusation which affects myself if I do join with Mr Pfr  Fn  and Mr  All  in this Observation that when Masters of Arts one of them particularly distinguished several Fellows of Colleges and many other Gentlemen of great Reputation whose Characters have from their Admission to this Time remained unblemished do receive such a Disgrace as to be publicly cited to this Court that the Facts might be expected to be of a more extraordinary Nature or at least much better supported than I flatter myself they really appear to every candid and impartial Hearer  But this Consideration I submit to the Judgment of the Court And I hope Mr Pr will not take it ill if I mention what I think it is my Duty to declare as my real and sincere Opinion that either through Defect of Memory or perhaps through that Confusion which Mr Pr acknowleges he was in at the Time he has mistaken some of the Facts misrepresented others and I have Reason to believe has in a great measure misconstrued the whole  I need not mention Particulars which have been already urged in Proof of this But I could not answer it to my Conscience did I not beg leave to speak only with regard to one Particular alleged against Mr  All viz  That when he desired Mr Pr to observe the Sobriety of the Club he should seem to express himself with a  Sneer  I stood close to Mr  All  at this Time and took particular Notice of him and I do from my Heart declare that as far as it is possible to judge of the inward Thoughts from the outward Behaviour as far as it is possible to distinguish the real Sentiments of the Heart from the Expressions of the Tongue which I allow is extremely difficult yet as far as my Penetration reaches I think the Look the Gesture the very Sound of Mr  All  's Voice and the Manner of delivering himself testified quite the contrary And as a further Proof of Mr  All  's Zeal to shew all proper Respect to Mr Pr on receiving  Applause from the Company for what he had said he immediately with as much tender Concern as any Man could express on the Occasion begged all the Gentlemen to offer no Insult to the Pr in which Petition Mr Pfr  Fn  and myself very strenuously joined I might mention other particulars alleged against the same Gentleman as well as against Mr Pfr  Fn  in which I am persuaded Mr Pr is very much mistaken but those Gentlemen have so well defended themselves that I shall only add one Observation or two more in general and proceed to answer to my own Charge  And  First  I cannot but believe that every candid Hearer will allow that the Behaviour of the presiding Members our Attendance at the Club purposely to preserve Regularity and Sobriety our previous Resolution to see the Gentlemen depart by the statutable Hour our zealous Endeavours to execute what we had resolved which Endeavours had succeeded but for that Deficiency in the Reckoning which to my Knowlege detained many who were desired to stay 'till it was made up that these Circumstances make us deserving of Applause rather than Reproach and ought to gain us the Thanks of the Officers of the Uy rather than be the Means of bringing us to our public Trial I must observe further as a Proof of the Regularity of my Schoolfellows that I believe there never was so large an Assembly  comprized chiefly of Youth met together upon so extraordinary an Occasion in which any public Officer could expect to find fewer Marks either of Riot or Intemperance  But to hasten to what regards myselfBefore I answer Particulars give me leave Mr  V C  to observe in general that as I have been upwards of seven Years of this Uy have now the Honour to be a Member of the Senate and Fellow of one of the principal Colleges that as during all this Time I have shewn the greatest Regard to the Laws of the Place have behaved with as much Regularity myself as any other Member and promoted the same as much in others I think and I flatter myself the whole Court will think it highly improbable I should at this Time of Day begin to trample upon Authority or insult any public Officer in the Execution of his Duty  The Credit therefore of the School I come from the Honour of the Uy and particularly of the College I belong to but what is more to me in my private Capacity my own Repute with those who have honoured me from my Admission to this Time with their Friendship and Patronage oblige me to endeavour to wipe off that Stain which my Character may possibly receive from this Accusation in the Eyes of them and many others who have hitherto I am persuaded entertained a very different Opinion of me  The first Fact I stand particularly charged with is in Mr Pr's Words That  "I insisted it was rude and uncivil or  Words to this Purpose  in him to visit when there were Masters of Arts in Company and one of them a Pfr"  and that I asked him  "if he did not think us able to take Care of the young Gentlemen in Company"  To which he replied  "It did not appear we had done so for it was now past Eleven"  This Reply of Mr Pr's I hope I may say without Offence seems to intimate that he rather meant to vindicate himself than prove any Insult offered to or Interruption in his Office from  me  unless he calls the remonstrating to him his unprecedented Behaviour to Masters of Arts and Want of that Civility which the strictest Officers have always paid to that Degree an Insult unless he calls that an Interruption in his Office which was meant to shew him how far we had been instrumental ourselves in promoting that Regularity and Sobriety which Mr  All  desired him to take Notice of  The next Article if meant as an Accusation is with Submission to the Court of a very extraordinary Nature since I never knew before that it was criminal to receive Applause nor can I imagine that any of the Court or even Mr Pr himself will think it more so to be delighted with it to be delighted with the Approbation of my Schoolfellows for  speaking in support of the Privileges of a Master of Arts and of the Deference which I perhaps ignorantly thought might be expected to be paid by any Officer of the Uy to a Pfr in the same  The two remaining Articles against me are  First  That  "I insisted it was strange or  Words to that Effect  that the Execution of these Orders should be begun at the  Wr  Club"  and  Secondly  That I further said  "We scarcely know what these Orders are which to be observed and which not and complained  in general Words  that it appeared some were executed and some not"  That the Words which Mr Pr has put into my Mouth in the first Part of this Charge are such as I made Use of I believe I may venture to deny since I was far from thinking that it's being the  Wr  Club gave it a greater Sanction or exempted it from any legal Visitation more than another but meant to signify that as an annual Meeting at which Masters of Arts presided it might not unreasonably hope for a little more Indulgence than is usually allowed to a private Company And Mr Pr must have greatly mistaken my Words in the other Part of the Charge to accuse me of denying my Knowlege of these Orders since I protest Mr  V C  I said nothing to any such Purpose and I believe yourself and the rest of the Court will think it highly improbable I should when I had the new  Regulations at that very Time in my Pocket and was present when they passed  These Mr  V C  are all the Articles particularly alleged against me to which how far and how clearly I have answer'd I willingly leave to your Determination which I hope will be such as to clear me entirely from any Aspersions which this Accusation may have thrown upon me and that I may not now begin to appear the Promoter of Irregularity and the Encourager of Disobedience who have so long given Testimony of a far different Disposition  Mr  Vn  then being asked by the  V C  if he had any Thing to say in Answer to the Pr's Accusation spoke thus  Mr  V C  and Gentlemen of the Court  I Am here called upon publicly to vindicate my Character which has been stigmatized through the whole Uy upon Mr Pr's Accusation of having in a particular Manner distinguished myself in the Affronts he pretends were put upon his Office the Night he visited the  Wr  Meeting and having added Insults to that Injury when he called upon me to give an Account of my Conduct at his Room  So much has been already spoken and so justly in Vindication as well of the Conduct of the  Masters of Arts  as of all the Members  of the Society without Exception that should it be thought incumbent on me to answer this Part of my Charge at all as I shall endeavour to shew Reason why I should not a few Observations would be sufficient to quash and falsify such a frivolous and illsupported Accusation  And here it is a Satisfaction to me that I can if necessary support my Confutation of this Part of my Charge by the Evidence of  This Gentleman being one of the Club tho' by Mistake not cited into Court was not permitted to appear as an Evidence in Mr  Vn  's Favour  a Gentleman a Fellow of a College and who not being summoned as an Accomplice will I hope appear a more unexceptionable Witness than a Person whose Confusion had led him into the numberless Mistakes and Calumnies which have been amply set forth by the Gentlemen who have so fully answered their Parts of the Charge already  To begin with the first Objection which I have already hinted I must beg leave to remind the Court of the surprizing Incident by which Mr Pr had the Happiness to discover that heinous Offender whose rude and insolent Behaviour had struck him in so particular a Manner amidst the universal Insult he so loudly complains of He tells you his first Suspicion light on Mr  Ve  who having cleared himself our  Accuser  finds himself once more at a Loss for his Culprit and a whole Day passes before his good Fortune throws in  his Way a false and malicious Report which having compared with his own confused Recollection of what had passed or rather Invention of what had not passed he fixes his Charge upon me a Person whom he confessed at his Chambers he had not the least previous Knowlege of nor did he pretend when I appeared to recollect me And as he also chuses to conceal the Author of his Intelligence it is probable and will I hope incontestably appear that his Informer was as ignorant in that respect as himself  From such Conjectures and such hearsay Evidence he makes not the least Scruple to affirm that I am the Person he pretends to have great Reason for Complaint against and as I have always heard it is necessary that the Accuser should be positive in his Proofs of the Person of the Accused even before he is permitted to give his Charge I hope it will appear Time to call for some more unexceptionable Evidence than the Repetition of a Calumny communicated by a Person whose Name is to remain a Secret  Mr  V C  here asked if Mr  Vn  would rest his Defence there He replied he would readily proceed to examine the Articles of the Charge provided this Objection might have it's due Weight which was promised It must here be observed that the Person who attended Mr Pr swore first that he observed no such Behaviour as is in the Charge attributed to Mr  Vn  from any Person And secondly that he did not know Mr  Vn  at the Time they visited the Meeting  The first Article of the Charge accuses me  "of laughing in his the Pr's Face and behaving otherwise very insolently"  If so laudable an Occasion of meeting my Friends and renewing earliest Acquaintances had inclined me to a more joyous Disposition and Aspect than the solemn Appearance of such an Officer as Mr Pr required I hope that Consideration and not the Insolence that Gentleman ascribes as the Motive will be thought to have occasioned the gay Appearance which seems so much to have shocked him and I can't help applying on this Occasion that equitable Maxim with which Mr  All  concluded his Defence  Inter dispares Sententias mitior vincat  The next Article says that  "I continued to shew several Marks of Rudeness"  This vague nomeaning Article as Mr Pr seems not to recollect these Marks I may do well to pass in Silence  Next follows that I was going to reply to a Question he has thought proper to omit I should not trouble you Mr  V C  with a Repetition of these Heads of Accusation if they were not alleged as Marks of so ungentlemanlike a Behaviour as Insolence which is here endeavoured to be proved by candidly anticipating Words which he says I was prevented from speaking Mr Pfr  Fn  who he said was the Person that stopped me assured the Court he remember'd no such Attempt from me nor any such Prevention on his Part And this Part of my Accusation is concluded  by affirming they were to have been insolent had they been uttered  I come now to the second Part of Mr Pr's Charge where he has selected some Expressions which appeared to him injurious to the Discipline and Officers of the Uy Had he been pleased to deliver the whole Sentences in which those Expressions were contained I should I am persuaded have stood absolved from any such Aspersion and here I apprehend it will again appear extraordinary that Words said to be dropped from an accused Person in a private Examination should serve to aggravate that Person's Charge in a Court of Equity  The first Article on this second Head accuses me of having talked much of my Independency The World I remember to have used and to this Effect that as I was not intimidated by any Dependence on the Uy I was ready and willing to answer Mr Pr's Accusation at any Time and in any Place he should think proper to call upon me This I said in answer to his asking me If I proposed to deny his Accusation in the same Manner I had done there wherever I should be called to an Account  I am next accused of questioning him as to the Customs of his Office and what is more strange I am complained of in a Court of Justice for owning him capable to instruct me My Question was whether his Office obliged  him to interrupt in that rigorous Manner so regular and solemn a Meeting as the Celebration of the Anniversary of our Benefactress  The following carry so dubious an Air that I question if Mr Pr's Memory though in no small Esteem with him was not in this Case a little suspicious to himself as the Terms are so general and his assistant Expletives are so frequently called in though very judiciously I must confess as I apprehend if it had not been for those Licences of Rhetoric the Words  Sneer  and  Contemptuous  being thrown in these Articles could not bear the least Colour of Offence  Next comes an amphibious Article and whether to consider it as an Accusation against or an Excuse for the Person he is accusing I am at a Loss as his acquitting me of any Intention to affront him is a new Expedient for corroborating a Charge of Insolence He indeed seems to have answered one End which is endeavouring to make it appear that Mr Pfr  Fn  was the Man who received all our Applause and by that adding some Credibility to his malicious Assertions against him But I do declare that I said I applauded to signify my Approbation of what was said by the Gentlemen who took the Pains to speak for the Company without naming any particular Person This I thought it incumbent upon me to mention as I observed the same Insinuation in Mr  Ve  's Charge  His last Article seems calculated to prejudice the Uy against me if indeed Men of Sense could be suspected to be biassed by a Declaration of Mr  Bn  's Opinion of what will be my future Conduct  Having briefly gone through every Article of a Charge grounded on Hearsay and resting on Mr Pr's Interpretations of Looks Reflections on Words spoke and about to be spoken his Notions of Gestures and Presagings of future Events nothing now remains but that I return my particular Thanks to you Mr  V C  and to the Gentlemen of the Uy in general for so candid and attentive a Hearing and for that Desire shewn so much to their Honour of hearing my Confutation of one of the severest of Charges had it been proved I mean the Contempt of superior Authority mildly and impartially exerted And having had an Opportunity to clear myself in their Eyes adds not a little to the Satisfaction I shall receive in finding myself absolved by so equitable and unexceptionable a Judge  Mr  Vn  having finished Mr  Ve  also made a short modest and sensible Speech in Defence of his Conduct  The Defences being over the  V C  desired Time to consider the Circumstances and adjourned the Court to  Thursday November    And now it was hoped that after the Defendants had so fully proved the Charge against  them to be groundless false and maliciousafter Part of it had been confuted by the Oaths of Witnesses producedafter they had shewn the Pr's Evidence to be nothing but Malice Confusion and Perplexitythat the Gentlemen accused would all of them have been justly and honourably acquitted but upon what Foundation or from what Motives we will not pretend to say they met with a very different Fate For on  Thursday Nov  at Three in the Afternoon the Court being once again met on this  very important  Affair the  V C  delivered his Sentence which was to this Effect  That it was the Opinion of the Court that Mr  Fn  Mr  All  Mr  Cw  Mr  Vn  and Mr  Ve  were guilty of the Charge alleged against them by the Pr and that they should be reprimanded for it and he did therefore reprimand them But in regard to Mr  All  's Sentence in particular the  V C  delivered himself in the following Words  It is a most disagreeable Circumstance to me that I am obliged to add in support of the Dignity of the Office of  V C  that it is the unanimous Opinion of this Court that Mr  All  for his rude contemptuous and disobedient Behaviour  Nulla Juris ratio aut aequitatis benignitas patitur ut qua salubriter pro utilitate hominum introducontur ea nes duriore interpretatione contra ipsorum commodum ad severitatem producamus  Dig    l    to me during his  Mr  All  remonstrating after Sentence pass'd that he could not recollect any Thing in his Defence

and I do by my Authority accordingly suspend you  ab omni Gradu suscepto et suscipiendo  The rest of the Club were also reprimanded and all under the Degrees of  M A  or  L L B  punished  s    d  for being out of College after Eleven o'Clock  All the Parties accused condemned in the Expences of the Court  Mr  All  not conscious to himself of having by any Part of his  Mr  All  remonstrating after Sentence pass'd that he could not recollect any Thing in his Defence deserving it Dr  Ge  said  "Sir it was not what you said but the Manner of it Sir you know  you elevated your Voice  "  Defence deserved so severe a Sentence appealed against it to the Senate  The Appeal was admitted in Court and entered by the Register But Mr  All  waiting on the  V C  next Day with the Pr who is appointed by the Statute in Cases of Appeal to inhibit the Execution of the Sentence the  V C  would not suffer Mr  All  to proceed but desired Time to consider whether he should admit the Appeal or not and after about a Fortnight's Deliberation sent Mr  All  the following Note  SIR  I Could not determine upon your Business before Yesterday after the Post came in and then it was agreed that no Appeal could be allow'd from my Sentence of  Suspension  I am Sir  Your very humble Servant E K  Mr  All  being of Opinion that the  V C  is not authorized by the Statutes of the Uy to refuse his Right of Appeal is determined to support and defend it  FINIS  ERRATA  PAGE l for  seperate  read  separate  P l a Period at  Club  P in the Quotation for  Actore  read  Actori  P in the Quotation for  comedenda  read
