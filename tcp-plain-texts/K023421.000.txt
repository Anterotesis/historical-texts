 AN ESSAY on ACTING In which will be consider'd The Mimical Behaviour OF A Certain fashionable faulty ACTOR AND THE Laudableness of such unmannerly as well as inhumane Proceedings To which will be added A short CRITICISM On His acting MACBETH  So have I seen a Pygmie strut  Mouth and rant in a Giant's Robe  Tom Thumb  Oh Macbeth has murder'd Gk  Shakespear  LONDON  Printed for W BICKERTON at the  Gazette  in the  Temple Exchange  near the  Inner Temple Gate Fleetstreet  M DCC XLIV Price Sixpence  AN ESSAY ON ACTING c  AS I have a long Time twenty Years or more made the STAGE and ACTING my  Study  and  Entertainment  I look upon myself and indeed am thought by my Intimates a proper Person to  animadvert upon  or  approve the Errors  and the  Excellencies  of the Theatre and as there can be no better Opportunity offer itself than  now  when the Town is running after their  little fashionable Actor  in a Character of which he is properly speaking the  Anticlimax  of or rather the  Antipode  of  Shakespear  I will endeavour in the following Dissection of our  Puppet Heroe  to convince my dear  Country Men  and  Country Women  that they are madly following an  Ignis fatuus  or  Will of the Whisp  which they take for  real substantial Light  and which I shall prove to be only the  Rushlight of Genius  the  Idol of Fashion  and an  Airdrawn Favourite  of the  Imagination  HOW are we degenerated in Taste  Oh how chang'd how fallen  Milton  's Paradise Lost  That our Theatre shall be crowded with Nobility Ladies and Gentry to see  Macbeth Burlesqu'd  or  Begk'd  which are synonimous when they might read Mr  Theobald's Edition of him  without throwing away their Money  mispending their Time ruining their Taste or running the Hazard of catching a violent Cold for a mere  Nonentity  However that I may not seem to be prejudic'd against Mr  Gk  as I really am not for I admire him for thus boldly daring to deceive and cheat three Parts of the Nation I shall having now crack'd the  Shell  of  my Spleen  against the Town come to the  Kernel  of  Reason  and present 'em this  little sweet Nut  of theirs  wormeaten  to the  Sight imbitter'd  to their  Taste  and  abhorr'd  to their  Imaginations  as  Shakespear  terms it  IN order to do this I shall present my Readers with the following short  Treatise  upon ACTING which will shew 'em what ACTING  ought to be  and what the present  Favourite  in Question  is not  A Short TREATISE UPON ACTING By which The PLAYERS may be  Instructed  and the TOWN  Undeceiv'd  That I may convince the World that the  Publick Good  and no  Private Animosity  has extracted the following Treatise from its Author I shall first give an ample and clear  Definition  of  ACTING  and make the  Natural Metaphysical  and  Consequential  Deductions that will immediately elicite the  Right  from the  Wrong  and shew my Designs are merely  Scientifical  and not  Subservient  to  Pique  and  partial Prejudice  ACTING is an  Entertainment of the Stage  which by calling in the Aid and Assistance of  Articulation Corporeal Motion  and  Occular Expression imitates assumes  or  puts on  the various  mental  and  bodily Emotions  arising from the various Humours Virtues and Vices incident to human Nature  THERE are  Two  different Kinds of Exhibitions  viz  TRAGEDY and COMEDY the  first  fixes her Empire on the  Passions  and the more exalted  Contractions  and  Dilations  of the Heart the  last  tho' not inferior  quotidem Science  holds her Rule over the less enobled Qualities and Districts of human Nature which are call'd the  Humours  Now in some Cases  Passions  are  Humours  and  Humours Passions  for the Revenges of an  Alexander  and a  Haberdasher  may have the same  Fountain  and differ only in their  Currents  and tho' the one  Alexander  cannot content himself but with the total Subversion of his Enemy's  Kingdom and the other  the Haberdasher  is satisfy'd with rolling his Antagonist in the Kennel yet still it is  Revenge  the Mind of one is equally affected in Proportion to the other and all the Difference lies in the different Ways of  satisfying their common Passion  But now to the Applicationâ–ª and Design in Hand If an Actor and a  favourite  Actor in assuming these different Characters with the  same Passions  shall unskilfully differ only in  Dress  and not in  Execution  and supposing him right in  One  and of Consequence absolutely ridiculous in the  Other  Shall this Actor I say in Spite of  Reason Physicks  and  common Observation  be caress'd applauded admir'd But to illustrate it more by ExampleSuppose the  Murder  of  Duncan  and the  Breaking a Urinal  shall affect the Player in the same Manner and the only Difference is the  blue Apron  and  lac'd Coat  shall we be  chill'd  at the  Murderer  and  roar  at the  Tobacconist  Fie for ShameAs the  One  must be absolutely the Reverse of Right I think the Publick for so gross an Imposition should  drive  both  off the Stage When  Drugger  becomes  Macbeth  and  Macbeth Drugger  I feel for the Manes of the  Immortal Shakespear  and  Inimitable Ben  I bemoan the  Taste  of my Country and I would have the  Buffoon  sacrific'd to appease the  Muses  and restore to us a true  Dramatick Taste  by such an examplary Piece of Justice I shall now as relative to my my present Subject describe in what Manner the two abovemention'd Characters  ought  to be  mentally  and  corporeally  Agitated under the different Circumstances of the  Dagger  and  Urinal  and by that shall more fully delineate what is meant by  Passions  and  Humours  When  Abel Drugger  has broke the  Urinal  he is  mentally absorb'd  with the different Ideas of the  invaluable  Price of the  Urinal  and the Punishment that may be inflicted in Consequence of a Curiosity no way appertaining or belonging to the Business he came about Now if this as it certainly  is  the Situation of his Mind How are the different Members of the Body to be agitated Why ThusHis  Eyes  must be revers'd from the Object he is most intimidated with and by dropping his  Lip  at the some Time  to  the Object it throws a trembling  Languor  upon every  Muscle  and by declining the right Part of the Head  towards  the  Urinal  it casts the most  comic Terror  and  Shame  over all the  upper  Part of the Body that can be imagin'd and to make the  lower  Part equally ridiculous his  Toes  must be  inverted  from the  Heel  and by  holding  his  Breath  he will unavoidably give himself a  Tremor  in the  Knees  and if his  Fingers  at the same Time seem  convuls'd  it finishes the compleatest low Picture of  Grotesque Terror  that can be imagin'd by a  Dutch  PainterLet this be compar'd with the  modern Copies  and then let the Town judgeNow to  Macbeth  When the  Murder  of  Duncan  is committed from an immediate  Consciousness  of the Fact his  Ambition  is  ingulph'd  at that Instant by the Horror of the Deed his  Faculties  are intensely rivited to the  Murder  alone without having the least Consolation of the  consequential Advantages  to comfort him in that Exigency He should at that Time be a  moving Statue  or indeed a  petrify'd Man  his Eyes must  Speak  and his  Tongue  be  metaphorically Silent  his  Ears  must be  sensible  of  imaginary  Noises and  deaf  to the  present  and  audible  Voice of his Wife his  Attitudes  must be  quick  and  permanent  his Voice  articulately trembling  and  confusedly intelligible  the Murderer should be seen in  every Limb  and yet every  Member  at that Instant should seem  separated  from his  Body  and his  Body  from his  Soul  This is the Picture of a compleat  Regicide  and as at that Time the  Orb below should be hush as death  I hope I shall not be thought  minutely circumstantial  if I should advise a  real  Genius to wear  Cork Heels  to his Shoes as in this Scene he should seem to  tread on Air  and I promise him he will soon discover the great Benefit of this however seeming  trifling Piece of Advice  THE only Way to arrive at  great Excellency  in  Characters  of  Humour  is to be very  conversant with  Human Nature  that is the noblest and best Study by this Way you will more accurately discover the  Workings of Spirit  or what other Physical Terms you please to call it upon the different  Modifications  of  Matter  Would the Painter produce a perfect Piece to the World let him  Copy from the Life  let Nature herself sit to the Artist Wou'd a Player perform equally excellent in  his  Profession let him be introduc'd into the World be conversant with  Humours  of every Kind digest 'em in his  Mind  let 'em be cherish'd by the  genial Warmth  of his  Conception transplanted into the fair Garden  of his  Judgment  there let 'em  ripen to Perfection  and become  his own Hic Labor Hoc Opus  The late celebrated Mr  Dogget  before he perform'd the Character of  Ben  in  Love for Love  took Lodgings in  Wapping  and  gather'd thence  a  Nosegay  for the whole Town Another Comedian  now living  tho' not upon the Stage it being so replete with greater Geniuses has been observ'd constantly to attend the  'Change  for  Weeks together  before he exhibited one of  Shakespear  's most inimitable and  difficult  Characters and so far succeeded by his  great Attention  and  Observation  of the  Manners Dress  and  Behaviour  of a  particular Tribe of People  that the  Judgment Application  and  extraordinary Pains  he took to divert the Publick  rationally  was amply return'd with crowded Theatres and  unequall'd Applauses  nay to so  great a Degree  did they shew their Approbation to this  Painstaking Genius  that he is at present more known by the Name of the  Character he perform'd  than by  his own  I shall not enter into the Reasons why he is at present excluded Theatre but shall only as an Advocate for the Publick say that I wish for  their  Sake that there were many such Actors as him upon  both  Theatres  I have in as concise a Manner as possible given my Sentiments of  Acting  by  Example  and  Precept  but there will very  soon be publish d a more compleat and expanded  Treatise upon  ACTING with an accurate  Description  of each  Humour  and  Passion  their  Sources  and  Effects  by which the  Players  may be taught to renounce their  Errors  and the  Town  its Judgment of  Acting  and  Actors    Here Ends the Essay upon Acting  Some  Critical OBSERVATIONS  upon the Character of  MACBETH  as it is at present  Attempted  at the  TheatreRoyal  in  DruryLane  THE following Critque is design'd as a Supplementary Appendix to the foregoing  Essay on  ACTING and as that was not so  full  and  investigating  as my Imagination had at first form'd it I shall in this short  Survey of Heroism in Miniature  still have my Eye upon the  Essay on  ACTING and at the same Time convince the Publick that they have  insensibly  been  misguided  by  Fashion  and that they have in  the Dark runaground  their  Reputation  on the  Sandy Banks  of  Error  But I shall now fix a  Lanthorn  at the  Poop  of their  Misconceptions  they shall  see their Distress  I will set my  Hand  to the  Pump  of  Conviction  clear the Vessel from  sixteen Feet Water  of  AntiTaste  keep it from  foundering  hoist up the  Flag  of  Criticism  and once more  pilot  their  Understandings  into the  Harbour  of  True Judgment  But Metaphor apart what is the  Character  of  Macbeth  He is an experienc'd General crown'd with Conquest  innately Ambitious  and religiously Humane spurr'd on by  metaphysical  Prophecies and the  unconquerable Pride  of his  Wife  to a Deed  horrid  in  itself  and  repugnant  to his Nature but as it is the  Ladder  to the  swelling Act of the Imperial Theme  his  Milk  soon becomes  Gall  imbitters his whole Disposition and the Consequence is the  Murder  of  Duncan  the  taking off  of  Banquo  and his own  Coronation  Thus stands  Macbeth  Now to our Inferences  Valour  and  Ambition  the two Grand  Characteristicks  of  Macbeth  form in the  Mind's Eye  a Person of  near six Feet High corpulently Graceful  a  round Visage  a  large hazel Eye aquiline Nose prominent Chest  and a  wellcalv'd Leg  rather inclin'd to that which is call'd an  Irish Leg  this I say would be the  Painter's  Choice was he to give us the  Macbeth  of  his Imagination  I mention this only to prove that Mr  Gk  is not form'd in the least  externally  no more than  internally  for that Character and tho' there are many Figures in the World would become it very well tho' not exactly coincident with my Description yet the nearer they approach to it they will the better  look Ambition Heroism  and  Murder  Mr  Gk  could he  Speak  the  Part  is well form'd for  Fleance  or one of the  Infant Shadows  in the Cauldron Scene but for the Manager to impose  him  upon the Town for a  Macbeth  and to refuse taking  another Comedian  into his House is such an Example of  Ignorance  and  Impudence  that is not to be  paralell'd  but by his own  unparalell'd  BehaviourMr  Gk  's Dress is very faulty  too  his  Coat should be  Banquo  's and  Banquo  's his and for this Reason  Red  and  Gold  suits the Dignity of  Macbeth  and at the same Time implies a more  principal  and  exalted  Character without derogating or taking from the Rank of  Banquo  in  Red  and  Silver  who  titularly  bears an  equal  Station as  Commander  tho'  militarily  bears an  inferior  Proportion as  Man  This Distinction is very nice and perhaps may not glare upon common Readers as defin'd here but was this Decorum nicely preserv'd the Eyes of all from the  Critick  to the  Groundling  as  Shakespear  calls 'em would immediately convey to the Mind the several Degrees and minute Distinctions of the Character from the Colour and Trimmings of his ApparelI shall leave it to the Consideration of the Publick whether or no a  Tye Wig  is more eligible than a  Major  or a  plain Hat  than a  lac'd one  for my own Part I say  No  SO much for  Dress  and  Figure  now I shall proceed to the more difficult and physical Parts of the Character and shall consider the  Action Speaking  and  Conception  of our  modern Heroe  THE first Words of the Part  So foul and fair a Day I have not seen  in my Opinion are spoke wrong  Mackbeth  before his Entrance has been in a great Storm of Rain Thunder c Now as the Audience have been appriz'd of this by the threeâ–ª Witches he should very  emphatically  describe the quick Transition from being  wet to the Skin  to being almost instantaneously  dry'd again  Tho' I can't convey in Writing the Manner how it  should  be spoke yet every Reader may comprehend how it  ought  to be spoke and know that in the Manner it is  now  spoke the Sentiment is  languid unintelligible  and  undescriptive  I shall now examine the most remarkable Scene in the whole Play which  is that of the  Airdrawn Dagger  This I shall make appear he has mistook from the Beginning to the End  Macbeth  as a Preparation for this Vision is so prepossess'd from his Humanity with the Horror of the Deed which by his more prevailing Ambition he is incited to and for the Perpetration of which he lies under a promissary Injunction to his Lady that his Mind being torn by these different and confus'd Ideas his Senses fail and present that  fatal Agent  of his Crueltythe  Dagger  to himNow in this visionary Horror he should not rivet his Eyes to an  imaginary  Object as if it  really  was there but should shew an  unsettled Motion  in his Eye like one not quite awak'd from some disordering Dream his  Hands  and  Fingers  should not be  immoveable  but  restless  and endeavouring to disperse the Cloud that over shadows his optick Ray and bedims his Intellects here would be Confusion Disorder and Agony  Come let me clutch thee  is not to be done by  one  Motion only but by several  successive Catches  at it first with one Hand and  then with the other preserving the same Motion at the same Time with his Feet like a Man who out of his Depth and half drowned in his Struggles  catches  at  Air  for  Substance  This would make the Spectator's Blood run cold and he would almost feel the Agonies of the Murderer himself I have spoke of the Scene following the Murder in my  Essay on Acting  and shall only say that the  Daggers  are near an Inch and half too long in Proportion to the Heighth of the Murderer The NightGown he appears in after the Murder ought to be a  Red Damask  and not the fripperyflower'd one of a  Foppington  but when  Taste  is wanting in  Trifles  and  Judgment  in  Essentials  how can we hope to see the THEATRE flourish I must make a Remark upon him in the  Banquet Scene  which is the most glaring Absurdity that ever was committed by an Actor When  Banquo  's Ghost gets Possession of  Macbeth  's Chair and the latter frighted at his Appearance by Words and Actions says  Which of you have done this  Meaning the Murder of  Banquo  here the Actor should address himself to the  Guests  and not keep a  fix'd Eye  upon the  Ghost  he should turn his Head  from Banquo  and say to the Lords at Supper  Which of you have done this  For to speak to the  plural  Number and look at the  singular Banquo  only is most absurd and ridiculous Then at the  second  Appearance of the Ghost at the Words  Dare me to the Desart with thy Sword Macbeth  should draw his Sword and put himself in a Posture of Defence and when he comes to  Hence horrid Shadow  he should make a home Thrust at him recover himself upon the  Ghost  's moving and keep passing at him till he has got him quite out of the Room The Manner it has been done  heretofore  which is keeping the Hand upon the Sword and following him out is not so natural and effecting as the Way I propose and if any Objection is made that  Macbeth  should know that  Ghosts  are not  vulnerable  I answer  Macbeth  's Horror confounds him and his Actions must denote the  Non Compos  Here I must take Notice of an Omission in  the Part of  Banquo  when he appears at the Banquet he ought to rise in a  Red Cloak  as he was seen to cross the Stage in one immediately before his Murder this would throw a great Solemnity upon the Figure of  Banquo  and preserve the Decorum of the StageI must likewise observe that in  Shakespear  's Time the Actors wore their own Hair and now from the present Fashion of wearing Wigs some Speeches are become absurd such for Instance is this of  Macbeth Never shake thy Goary Locks at me  when at the same Time the Ghost is seen in a  Tye Wig  If I might be allow'd to propose an Alteration with all imaginable Deference to the immortal  Shakespear  in order to avoid this Blunder I would have the Actor say  Never shake thy Goary  TYE  at me  if the Word  Wig  is thought more Poetical it will be equally good as they are both Monosyllables  AS I have not yet left the  Banquet Scene  I must observe that the  Attitude Gk  stands in at the second Appearance of the  Ghost is absolutely wrong  Macbeth  here should  sink  into  himself  or rather if I may be allow'd the Expression  hide  himself behind  himself  or to illustrate it more by Example  Si parvis comporere c  he should imitate the contracting Power of a  Snail  preserving at the  same Time a slow awful manly  folding up of his Faculties and as his  Body  gathers up gradually at the Visionâ–ª his  Mind  should keep the same Time and denote its strong Workings and Convulsionsâ–ª at his  Eyes  the Glass of Wine in his Hand should not be dash'd upon the Ground but it should fall  gently  from him and he should not discover the least Consciousness of having such a Vehicle in his Hand his Memory being quite lost in the present Guilt and Horror of his Imagination  The Banquet  itself which is suppos'd to be a  Regal  one should not be compos'd of a few  Apples Oranges  and such like Trash but of  hot  costly  Viands  and large Pyramids of  wet Sweetmeats  and  Savoy Biscuits  this would cast an inconceiveable Grandeur upon the Scene and add greatly to the Horror of  the Ghost  Macbeth  says  To Night we hold a  SOLEMN  Supper Sir  which  Solemnity  should be preserv'd by having several  Bishops  and  inferior Clergy  at the Table and of Consequence the  supernatural  Appearance of  Banquo  would strike with double Force on the Minds of the Audience by their  Spiritual  Presence I could shew that this Play is even deficient in every  little Decoration  but this one gross Blunder will suffice to give us an Idea of all the rest  AS my Criticisms upon the three first Acts of  Macbeth  have been more full and extended than I at first design'd 'em I shall reserve my Observations upon the two last for another  Sixpenny  Pamphlet to which I shall subjoin a Criticism upon  Colombine Courtezan  which I shall examine critically Scene by Scene and lay open the Imperfections of that Piece discernable to the meanest Capacity and shall prove by undeniable  Conclusions  drawn from known  Postulata  that the  worst  Play that ever  Shakespear  wrote is greatly preferable to the  whole Performance of  Colombine Courtezan  I am very sensible what Difficulties and Prejudices I have to surmount in such an Undertaking but as I have the Reputation of my Country at Heart I am resolv'd to prosecute my laudable Intentions with indefatigable Care and unwearied Diligence  IN short to sum up the Whole of my present Observations upon this Head as I profess the strictest Adherence to Truth despise Flattery and am incapable of Fear I will venture to affirm there is not one pleasuregiving Scene throughout the whole Play of  Macbeth  as it is now acted But as I will ever do Justice to Merit I must own I felt some Pleasure at seeing Mr  Mills  's  Green Ribbon and Star  in the Character of  Duncan  the unexpected Introduction of the  Scotch Order  was an agreeable Novelty and discover'd great Fancy in the Actor therefore I could not refrain from giving it  here  a deserved Commendation and it shall always meet with my Approbation in the  Theatre  I think I cannot better finish a Criticism on  Macbeth  than with a succinct Description of the Talents and Capacity of its Author  Shakespear  was a Writer not to be confin'd by  Rule  he had a  despotick Power  over all Nature  Laws  would be an  Infringement  of his  Prerogative  his  scepter'd Pen  wav'd Controul over every  Passion  and  Humour  his  Royal Word  was not only  Absolute  but  Creative Ideas Language  and  Sentiment  were his  Slaves  they were  chain'd  to the  Triumphal Car  of his  Genius  and when he made his  Entry  into the  Temple of Fame  all  Parnassus  rung with  Acclamations  the  Muses  sung his  Conquests  crown'd him with neverfading  Laurels  and pronounc'd him  Immortal  AMEN  Here ends the Criticism on  Macbeth  I shall at once convince the World of my Impartiality with Regard to Mr  Gk  by allowing him all the Merit that  Mimickry  can give him which to be sure is very  pleasant over a Bottle tho' despicable on the StageBut how his being a good  Mimick  should entitle him to be a  great Actor  I can't so easily comprehend the  Punch  of a  Puppet Shew  and the  Heroe  of a  Theatre  are as different in their Characters as the Materials they are each compos'd of But how can he answer it to Conscience and his fellow Creatures his endeavouring by modulating his Organs of Speech and Action to those of other Actors to render them contemptible by such a visible Exposure of their Infirmities 'Tis  wicked  'tis  unjust  'tis  inhumane  and the People who are diverted by it and applaud him for it are  barbarous unciviliz'd  and  unfeeling  A  Pickpocket  is less culpable than a  Mimick  Suppose for Instance an Actor of either Theatre coming out of the PlayHouse has his Pocket pick'd of Ten or a Dozen Shillings in the  Piazza  or in  Catherinestreet  Care Oeconomy and his Business makes the Loss easy But if the same Actor is made ridiculous and looses the  Means  of replenishing his aforesaid pick'dpocket the  Mimick  that deprives him of ever having his Pocket  pick'd  again either in the  Piazza  or  Catharinestreet  is the Pickpocket himself I believe  Mimickry  was never thought of before in this Light therefore let it be  consider'd  let it be  condemn'd  Besides as a farther Confirmation of the  Unlaudableness  of such Proceedings I am told the very  mimick'd  Actors themselves are not very easy under this Treatment and are resolv'd never to be reconcil'd to any future  Analysis  of their  Looks Tones  or  Gestures  AS I am now oblig'd for want of Room to curb the  Impetuosity of my Pen  and stop its  critical Carears  I shall in a very short Time lay before the Publick another Pamphlet with some more additional Remarks upon the same Subject which will be a  proper Appendix  to the  Essay on Acting  and call'd  An Essay on the common Sewers  vulgarly stil'd  Common Shores  in which will  be consider'd the  Use  and  Abuse  of  Bumfodder  with some curious Observations upon the  present State of Politicks both at Home and Abroad
