 Mr  WHISTON  's  LETTER of  Thanks To the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of  LONDON  For His late LETTER TO HIS  CLERGY  Against the USE of  New Forms of Doxology  c  LONDON  Printed for  J Senex  at the  Globe  in  SalisburyCourt  and  W Taylor  at the  Ship  in  PaternosterRow  and are to be Sold by  J Roberts  near the  OxfordArms  in  WarwickLane    The first  Clause  of a  LETTER  from the Lord Bishop of  London  to the  Incumbents  of all  Churches  and  Chapels  in his Diocese concerning their not using any  New Forms of Doxology  c  Reverend Brethren  THERE is an Instance of your Care and Duty which I conceive my self at this time highly obliged to offer and you to regard as necessary for the Preservation of the very Foundations of our Faith Some Persons seduced I fear by the strong Delusions of Pride and Selfconceit have lately published new Forms of Doxology entirely agreeable to those of some Ancient Hereticks who impiously denied a Trinity of Persons in the Unity of the Godhead I do therefore warn and charge it upon your Souls as you hope to obtain Mercy from God the Father through the Merits of Jesus Christ our Lord and by the Sanctification of the Holy Ghost Three Persons and One God Blessed for ever that you imploy your best Endeavours to prevail with your several Flocks to have a great Abhorrence for the above mentioned new Forms and particularly that you do not suffer the same to be used either in your Churches or in any Schools where you are able to prevent that most pernicious Abuse  c  Mr  WHISTON  's  Letter of  Thanks  c  My Lord  ALTHO' I have not the Honour of being One of those Incumbents in your Lordship's Diocese to whom you immediately direct your late Letter against the Use of  New Forms of Doxology  c Yet because I generally frequent one of your Parish Churches where a  New Form of Doxology  is every Day used  Vid  Historical Pref Edit p  where yet according to your Lordship's laudable Admonition I dissent from that  New Form of Doxology  and use an  Old one  because I several Years ago at  Cambridge  oppos'd that  New  and there+fore by the same excellent Rule unjustifiable  Form of Doxology  I cannot but think it very fit for me to own the great Pleasure your Lordship's Caution against  New Forms of Doxology  has given me and in my own Name and in the Name of many other good Christians who with me reject all such  New Forms of Doxology  whatsoever I return your Lordship this Publick Thanks for your so open Approbation of our Conduct in this Matter  I take it here for granted My Lord that your Lordship is in earnest in this Letter that by  New Forms of Doxology  therein disapprov'd without any particular mention of the Forms themselves you truly mean such as arose long since the beginning of the Gospel That also by  New Forms of Doxology intirely agreeable to those of some ancient Hereticks  your Lordship particularly means those  New Forms  which were introduc'd by certain Hereticks in the fourth Century tho' your Lordship seems indeed unhappily to have mistaken their Name and Character  I take it also for granted My Lord that 'tis impossible for a Christian and a Protestant Bishop both which your Lordship is known to be to call the ancient and sacred Doxologies of St  Paul  St  Peter  St  John  St  Jude  c with those of the rest of the most primitive Christians  New Forms of Doxology intirely agreeable to those of some ancient Hereticks  And upon this reasonable Supposition I do again return your Lordship my most hearty Thanks for so seasonable and Christian a Caution against the modern gross and notorious Corruption of this kind  Now that this solemn Caution of your Lordship's against all  New Forms of Doxology  may have the greater regard paid to it by all the Clergy of your Diocese I shall beg leave to supply what seems wanting in your Lordship's Letter and shall produce here all the certainly genuine  Forms of Doxology  that upon a former diligent Enquiry I met with in the Apostolick Age or a little later And that your Lordship may be secure that none of them shall be liable to the lea  suspicion of favouring any dangerous Opini+ons  that arose in the fourth Century your Lordship will there find that the latest of them is near two hundred Years older than the rise of either the  Arian  or  Athanasian  Heresies And I hope this Account may be farther useful to your Lordship's Clergy as affording them for Practice sure Original positive Rules or Forms of Doxology free from all suspicion of  Heretical Pravity  which also your Lordship has intirely omitted to give them in your Letter  The Primitive Doxologies  Rom I  MORE than the Creator who is blessed for ever  Amen  IX  Who is over all God blessed for ever  Amen  or The God over all be blessed for ever  Amen

to  Jesus Christ  himself The single one in  Jude  is directed only  to the Father  Of the six in the Apocalypse of  John  three are directed  to the Father  alone one  to the Son  alone and the other two  to the Father and to the Son  jointly So that in the Sacred Writing own'd to be  Canonical  the Holy Ghost  never mention'd in Doxologies at all an  the Son not often any otherwise than as the Mediator  Clement  's eight and the Apostl  six Doxologies also in  Clement  's Epistle an  former six Books of the Constitutions ar  exactly like those of  Paul  intirely directe  to the Father  or  to the Father through the Son  without any mention of the Holy Ghost Th  publick Doxologies of the Jewish and Gen+tile Liturgies contain'd in the seventh an  eighth Books of the Constitutions are di+rected sometimes  to the Father  alone some+times  to the Father through the Son  and the re  that we have reason to believe uncorrupt  to the Father and the Son in the Holy Ghost  e+specially in

Op p  In Christ Jesus our Lord To whom be Glory for ever and ever  Amen  This Doxology is wanting in  Evagrius  's Original Latin Version However see the like afterwards  Epist ad Afr § ult Op  p  Note  here That  Athanasius  's only Doxology before the Council of  Nice  and not a few afterward also were the same that has so long been called  Arian  I mean that of  in  and not  to  or  with  the holy Spirit And that  Athanasius  sometimes afterward used the one way of speaking as well as the other Just as  Basil  did also and as the present Copies of the Liturgy in the Eighth Book of the Constitutions do still exhibit it to us While it appears by other Evidence and by  Basil  's own Accounts that no other than that esteemed the  Arian  Form of  in the holy Spirit  can lay sure Claim to any publick Original or sacred Authority in the Church  Note  That  Basil  has a full and remarkable  De Spiritu Sancto ad Amphilochium  Discourse upon this Subject a short Summary of which only because of its length I shall here give the Reader as highly worthy of his serious Consideration upon this Occasion  Basil  then was accused by those that disliked the late Notions and Practices brought into the Church that he had ventured to alter the old Christian Doxology as to the Particle  in  which used to be given to the holy Ghost and that he often made use of  and  or  with  instead of it as if Glory and Honour and Adoration were to be not only ascribed to the Father and to the Son  in  the holy Ghost or by his Assistance but also directly  to  the holy Ghost himself as to a proper Object of Christian Adoration or Doxology In answer to which he owns that the Form  in  the holy Ghost is indeed certainly the ancient and undoubted Christian Form of Doxology and that he will sometimes make use of it still accordingly that however the other Forms  and  or  with  if they be not really genuine and original in Doxologies which yet he would willingly insinuate they have however been used upon other Occasions indifferently that even in Doxologies he is not the first that has used those Particles concerning the Holy Ghost but that several great Men had done the like before him at least since the beginning of the third Century as he proves by particular Instances and that he therefore looks upon it as a piece of  Arian  or Heretical Inclination to be so scrupulous of keeping to this one old Particle  in  out of Opposition to  those that would shew their Orthodoxy by the use of the other Particles  and  or  with  the holy Ghost This is the Purport of  Basil  's Reasoning in this Case And I own that if Prudentials must govern and Christians are at liberty to make themselves a new Object of direct Invocation or Doxology from remote Inferences of their own and out of Compliance with a prevailing Party  Basil  may be in the right as well as those that follow him in these Matters But if Divine Worship is only to be given in such a Manner and to such Objects as Divine Institution ordains He and all the  Athanasians  run a great Hazard in such Matters and must have a heavy Account to give of this their rash and unjustifiable and unchristian Procedure at the great Day Vid  Collection of Monuments p    The former Doxologies My Lord and many of the latter also are for certain the Old the Christian the Apostolical Doxologies some Centuries before  Arius  or  Arthanasius  were known in the World by which Men gave Glory and Praise  to  God the Father the Fountain and Origin of all Beings whatsoever together  with  or  through  the Mediation of Jesus Christ his Onlybegotten Son and  by  the Aid and Assistance of his Holy Spirit  And that your Lordship does fully approve of this ancient way of Worship and Doxology is plain by your own excellent and remarkable Words to the very same purpose which indeed describe exactly the manner of Christian Worship in the three first Centuries  I do warn and charge it upon your Souls  says your Lordship to your Clergy  as you hope to obtain Mercy from God the Father through the Merits of Jesus Christ our Lord  and by the Sanctification of the Holy Ghost  I omit the strange Clause that is added  this till hereafter But the Words before  are so truly Christian so very Primitive  perfectly Apostolical that I heartily wish you  Lordship may ever remember them and a  your Clergy may never forget them  But then My Lord That Form which ascrib  Glory and Praise  equal  Glory and Praise not  the Son only but also  to the Holy Spirit  is fo  certain  A New Form of Doxology  such as you  Lordship justly condems wholly unknow  to the Apostles and all the first Christia  for a long time and never properly settl  or submitted to till those dangerous Innov  +tors in Christianity  Athanasius  and his Adh  +rents were become of greater Authority tha  St  Paul  and his fellow Apostles and till in+deed at length our Lord's own grand Funda+mental  Joh XVII  This is life eternal to know Thee t  only True God and Jesus Christ whom thou ha  sent  was oblig'd to give place to the contrary fundamental of even a counterfeit  Ath  +nasius  that  Athanasian Creed  we must worship One God in Trin  +ty and Trinity in Unity  where  None  is sup+pos'd  afore or after other None  to be  great  or less than another but the whole Three Pe  +sons  are asserted to be  Coeternal together and C  +equal  where this Author also solemnly affirm  that this strange and new Doctrine  is the C  +tholick Faith which except a Man believe fait  +fully He cannot be saved  But now My Lord does it not evident  appear on the comparison of the form  Doxologies with the later that They we  neither the  Arians  nor  Eusebians  but th  Athanasians  that introduc'd a  New Form  Doxology  into the Church Both  Athanas  nd  Basil  as we have seen bear frequent Te  imony to the undoubted forms of more Pri  itive Antiquity and particularly that they  en Glorifyed the Father  by  or  with  the Son  nd always  in  or  by  the Holy Ghost while at  e same time the  Athanasians  also ventured  oldly against the very nature of the Christi  Religion and Worship to introduce this  oxology directly  to  the Holy Spirit which  orm can hardly be traced with certainty  ny higher than that fourth Century  Basil  eserves to be particularly taken notice of  this point who had not dared ever to  ll the Holy Ghost  God for fear  as  Nazianz Op p  Nazian  en  assures us in his funeral Oration  that  ose who sought to catch this plain word out of  is Mouth concerning the Holy Ghost that He  God might procure his and his Theological  ongues banishment out of the City  nay who was so hard set in his Innovations that he was once obliged to say what is now esteem  d by our Law next to  blaspemy  That  Basil Op Tom I p  He  as not God but the Spirit of God  and yet was at last affrighted with the dread of committing the unpardonable Sin if he did not  upport this  New Form of Doxology  Tom II p  To the Holy Ghost  But now My Lord Amidst my Thanks for your Lordship's Caution against  New Forms of Doxology  and my Joy for your excellent Clause agreeing with the  Old Ones  I must expostulate with you about your surprizing and unaccountable Addition to that excellent Cllause where after the mention of  God the Father  of  Jesus Christ our Lord  and of  the Holy Ghost  you add  Three Persons and One God Blessed for ever  It is I say to me in a Christian Bishop at this time of day a  Surprizing  and  Unaccountable  Addition I had indeed in my younger Years been by th  Custom of modern Writers betray'd into such a fatal Mistake my self as if the  Three Divine Persons  were  One God  or  the One Go  of the Christian Religion But assoon as ever I had search'd the Scriptures and th  ancient Christian Creeds and Writers I wa  fully convinc'd of the grossness of that Mis+take and have hardly been able to believe since that Examination that any who have carefully read the New Testament the Ol  Creeds and other Books of our Religion be+fore the Days of  Athanasius  can now seriou  +ly use or justify such Language And her  My Lord it may not be improper to repea  to your Lordship the Offer which I formerl  made to Dr  Sacheverell  when at his famou  Tryal he had ranked me among the  Bla  +phemers  the  Irreligious  and the  Heretick▪  because among other things I had in a  Erratum  desired that such an Expression  mine as your Lordship here uses might b  blotted out which Offer I give your Lord+ship as well as Dr  Sacheverell  full right  Call me to justify in any fair and open wa  whatsoever My Words there are these  'Since I have throughly enquired into it  am so fully satisfy'd that the  Father  alone  the  One God  of the Christian Religion tha  I must now own that when once I deny  doubt of that Doctrine I must deny or doub  of our common Christianity there being n  one Article more plain or more universall  acknowledged in all the first Ages of th  Church than that was And here I ventu  solemnly to challenge Dr  Sacheverell  himsel  and all his more Learned Friends to pr  +duce  one single direct Testimony  of any Christian and Catholick Writer excepting one or two Expressions of  Tertullian  contrary even to his own usual way of speaking if yet he can be called a Catholick Writer who said these  Three Persons  were  One God  or  the One God  before the Days of  Athanasius  in the fourth Century while I am ready to produce above  an Hundred  plain Testimonies on the other side that this  One God  is no other than  God the Father  Which indeed was the first Doctrine which the  Catechumens  learned and the grand Foundation of our whole Religion'  Historical Preface p    This My Lord is the plain  Old Form  of  peaking as to the Father That He is alone  he  One True God  of the Christian Religion which makes it strange that a Christian Bi  hop who is against  New Forms of Doxology  and must be suppos'd to know Christian An  iquity well should use the other  New Form  of Speaking That the  Three Persons  are  One God  without a single Authority in all the Bible or almost in any truly ancient Christian Writer whomsoever  But now My Lord though I have hitherto gone upon the favourable Hypothesis and have returned your Lordship Thanks on the Supposition that your Lordship really means what you say and are by consequence thro  against the common  New Form of Doxo  ogy  which seems to be design'd to give  equal Glory To the Father To the Son and To the Holy Ghost  Yet I cannot conceal the shrewd Suspicion not a few of your Readers have entertain'd that altho' your Lordship declares against  New Forms of Doxology  yet you are  or perhaps one of the  Newest Forms of Doxology  in the World  which is the common one▪ they suspect that you look on the  Old Form  made use of by St  Paul  St  Peter  St  John  S  Jude  c to be superannuated to be ver  mean and imperfect if not in some degre  Heretical that you apprehend if any Incumbents in your Diocese should use none bu  such Doxologies as the Apostles used th  Foundations of our Faith  would be  in danger▪  nay if any Incumbents should desire to fo  +low the Apostles Doxologies only in the Sing+ing Psalms established by no Law of th  State nor Canon of the Church and wher  by consequence such Forms seem hitherto to+lerated you  fear they are seduced by the stron  Delusions of Pride and Selfconceit  and tha  you esteem such Forms themselves  intirely  +greeable to those of some ancient Hereticks  tha  you warn your Clergy and charge it upon the  Souls that they  employ their best Endeavou  to prevail with their several Flocks to have  great Abhorrence of such New Forms  and  n  to suffer them to be used either in Churches  Schools  which is they say here stiled  a mo  pernicious Abuse  Now in Answer to these Suspicious Person  ▪ My Lord I can only alledge How prodig  +ously absurd it is once to imagine this to b  your Lordship's Meaning because it is in  manner to suppose you thus speaking to you  Clergy  'My Brethren Have a great Care of Bibl  ▪ Presidents New Testament Language Apo+stolick Prayers and Scripture Doxologies▪ they will lead you at length into the mo  pernicious Heresies The Bible indeed sti  calls  God the Father  and him alone  The On  True God  of the Christian Religion in di+stinction  from His Son and His Spirit The New Testament still directs the solemn and  supreme Christian Worship  to the same  One True God the Father  through the Mediation of the Son and by the Assistance of the Holy Spirit The Apostles tell us that Christ himself said  Joh XIV  The Father was greater than He  and that  Matt XXIV Mar XIII  He did not know the Day and Hour of the future  Judgment while he was on Earth till it was revealed to him by the Father afterward and that the  Apoc I V  Father alone then knew it  and they never once call the Holy Spirit  God  never once mention any  Invocation  to him The known  Scripture Doxologies  never say one word concerning the Holy Ghost nor do the Apostles other Records appear ever to make Him a distinct Object of such Doxology This is all true to a Demonstration and undeniable in all Christian Antiquity But have the greatest Care possible My Brethren of following such Examples  Hereticks always pretend to Scripture and they that keep closest to it are usually the most inclin'd to Heresy  Such Doctrines and Practices as I have just now mention'd were at first more innocent before  Athanasius  improved Christianity and  Basil  with several others  gave good Reasons  for those Improvements You are now to do as the Church bids you and call the  Three Persons  jointly the  One True God  You are to adore the Son  equally  with the Father You must believe that the  Father is not greater than the Son  and that the Son ever  knew the Day and Hour  of the future Judgment You must expressly call the Holy Ghost  God  as well as the Father and  Invocate  Him equally with the Father and the Son▪ You must give  Glory To the Father and T  the Son and To the Holy Ghost  as being al  three Consubstantial Coeternal and Coe+qual The Church indeed does think fit t  tolerate or rather to excuse different Lan+guage Notions and Practices in the Apo+stles and the first Christians because of thei  primitive Simplicity and because she ha  not then made any other Laws about those Matters But now the Case is quite otherwise▪  Latet anguis in herba  and what was excusabl  in St  Paul  will be plainly Heretical in suc  as Dr  C  or Mr  W  I conjure you there+fore My Brethren by all that is sacred▪ that you avoid and reject such antiquate  Doctrines and Practices Those perniciou  New Forms of Doxology  in particular which the Apostles used and which the foremen+tion'd dangerous Persons would revive a+mong us You have the glorious Example of or Years even ever since Po+pery began for your Encouragement and you need not scruple to charge those Doxo+logies with  Novelty  that can plead for them+selves no more than the Doctrine and Prac+tice of the Apostles and their Companions▪ and of the three or four first and simplest Ages of Christianity'  This My Lord seems to be the plain Pur+port of the principal Branch of your Lord+ship's Letter to your Clergy in the Opinion of these Suspicious Persons and this sets the Matter in so clear a Light that I hope i  will be impossible to mistake it and equally impossible to suspect that to be your Lord+ship's Meaning without supposing you to ac+knowledge before all the World that the  Church has an Authority far superior to that of  he Apostles of our Lord Christ  which cer  ainly is beyond the length of moderate Po  ery it self However many of your Lord  hip's Friends will certainly be in great pain  ill they hear farther from your Lordship  nd indeed till they find that it will not be  nsafe for Christians in your Lordship's Dio  ese to imitate the Apostles and that if St  Paul  St  Peter  St  John  and St  Jude  were  ere and insisted upon the Use of their old Doxologies they would not by your Lordship be discouraged or at least would not be  eny'd what we also hope will not be deny'd is that follow their Example I mean an o  en  Toleration  in this Matter  I freely own My Lord the great Dignity of your Lordship's Episcopal Office and can never be suspected by those that know me and my Opinions of any wilful or criminal Disrespect thereto I also heartily acknowledge the great Regard that is justly due to the Pastoral Instructions of Christian Bishops when they enforce any Parts of Christian Duty upon their Clergy or their Flocks in which Case I should greatly rejoice to be any way instrumental in forwarding the same But if  stead thereof the Sacred Episcopal Character and Authority be used to discourage any Duties of Christianity I and all sober Christians must constantly  Act IV  Hearken to God more than to Men  must  Tim I  Hold fast the  Apostolical  Form of sound Words  and the  Jude ver  Faith once delivered to the Saints  against all worldly Sollicitations Threats Authorities and Terrors whatsoever For the Apostle  Paul  assures us that even such as He  Cor XIII  could do nothing against the Truth but for the Truth  that  X XIII  Their Power  was for Edification and not for Destruction  ▪ that  Cor l  They had no Dominion over the Faith  Christians and that  Gal I  if They or  even  an Ang  from Heaven preached any other  than Christ  own  Gospel  they were to be  accursed  I am M  Lord so far as the Christian Religion permit  Your Lordship's most Humble and Obedient Servant William Whistor  Jan  PS  If your Lordship insists on the com+mon Form of Doxology  Glory be to the Fathe  and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost  you canno  possibly avoid altering the usual Response  it was in the beginning is now and ever shall b  world without end  because it will not then b  consistent with Truth For how much soev  the Church may pretend to a power of  alteri  and  improving  the old Christian Religion an  Christian Doxologies yet did she never I da  say pretend to a power of altering the natu  of Things and rendring an ancient Fact tru  which was certainly false So that she canno  possibly oblige Men to say that in using th  Doxology they give Glory  As it was in the b  +ginning  of the Gospel since it is evident tha  from the beginning it was not so  Nor ough  those good Christians who in God's due tim  hope for a Reformation of all such Noveltie  be oblig'd to affirm every Day in their Devo+tions in the presence of God and Men tha  such a Form of Doxology  ever shall be  used i  the Church  world without end  FINIS
