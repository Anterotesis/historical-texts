RECEIVED your favour of the th inst and shall proceed to give you an account of a phaenomenon that has lately appeared here A young fellow is arrived from London to join a brotherhood of players who usually make us a periodical visit at this season  of the year His person is compleat and elegant his voice remarkably sweet and articulate and his deportment that of a perfect gentleman It is impossible to look on him without feeling an immediate prepossession in his favour which increases the more he is seen and heard He played Romeo last Friday evening It was his first appearance yet I never beheld a performance that gave me so much pleasure such pathetic tenderness a voice so sweetly plaintive and amorous attended with an air of so much sincerity that it was imposible for any one who did not feel or had not felt the passion of love to have been so expressive But from what I have observed since I have taken it for granted that  he is  at this instant under its influence Whether  he is  or no I am certain all the women in Kendal young or old that have seen him  are  and the rest soon  will be For there is more gazing after him when he makes his appearance in the street than there was at the last comet No wonder he is master of every accomplishment without any seeming knowledge of superiority  I prevailed on him to sup with me after the play His conversation and behaviour more than confirmed every thing I had conceived in his favour His abilities seem to have no bounds and after supper we furnished him with a fresh opportunity of displaying them by introducing a little concert in which he might be said to be the only performer since he was the only one that was listened to He sung and played and with so much taste passion and expression that every body was amazed as well as delighted I dare say you think I am drawing a very extravagant picture but I can assure you all who have seen  him speak of him as the most agreeable and extraordinary young fellow they have ever known  YOU must understand I had occasion to do him a little service by rising up his champion on the night that he played He is so sensible of this trifling favour that he thinks he cannot enough admire my generosity It was thus Notwithstanding the surprize and pleasure the spectators were under when he came upon the stage at the beauty of his figure there issued from some part of the gallery a loud hiss The effect this had upon him was very extraordinary the blood forsook his cheeks his limbs tottered and his whole frame was thrown visibly into great disorder I was so shocked at their rudeness and injustice that I could not conceal my rage but jumped upon one of the seats in the pit and harangued the mob pretty  much I believe in that kind of language to which they were accustomed and as I am rather a favourite with some of them my declaring on the stranger's side soon overturned the party that was formed against him for I am certain that illjudged attack could proceed from no other cause From this time to the end of the play nothing but the loudest marks of applause were heard at every opportunity which were not bestowed upon an ingrate the effect that this encouragement had upon him was visible and the disorder which the ignorance and malice of the dissentients had put him into was a strong proof of his modesty and sensibility  HE received an invitation to our assembly which he has since told me he believes from motives of prudence he must be obliged to decline It seems the  last time the comedians were here and while I was at college one of them who from his behaviour and talents was entitled to respect not supposing it any deviation from the rules of decorum came one evening to the assembly upon which two or three coxcombs led on by 'Squire Bullhead a contemptible overbearing puppy whom you have heard me speak of finding themselves affronted insisted upon his being turned out of the room Bullhead was the spokesman and coming up to the comedian said in a very insulting manner  Pray friend does strolling actors ever larn to dance  The abruptness of this impudent question for a moment disconcerted the comedian but recollecting himself he answered  Some of them Sir and as easily as some rich country boobies learn insolence  Do you call me booby Sir    Why Sir to be  sure I mentioned something about Booby or Bullhead it is not material which I believe they are synonimous  Nonimus Sir you are a nonimus vagabun and so I desires that you will quit this here room  That I shall without farther ceremony Sir  said the player  and  I desire  you will do me the favour to follow me  Bullhead either did not or would not understand this intimation but remained amidst the titters and sneers of the company muttering something about  teaching such impudent vagabun rascals to trude themselves into the ciety gentlepeople  The comedian was not so satisfied but wrote a card the next day requiring Bullhead to meet him and either bring his sword or a case of pistols This paper terrified the fool out of his wits and he ran blubbering with it to his wife She posted away to shew it to her father who is an  acting justice The man of the quorum sent immediately for the manager and threatened to throw him and the whole troop in jail if he did not interfere and prevent this affair from going any farther The comedian at the intercession of his brethren dropt his revenge but not till he had procured a paper signed both by this redoubted 'Squire and his fatherinlaw the purport of which was a promise not to molest the players nor by any means endeavour to prevent their coming to Kendal as usual A night or two after this affair happened the Beaux Stratagem was played and the audience burst into an uproar of laughter when Scrub says  If our masters in the country receive a challenge the first thing they do is to tell their wives  c  and 'Squire Bullhead became the jest of the town  NOTWITHSTANDING this I hope we shall overcome the scruples of our young Romeo The girls are all dying to see him dance and have protested they'll none of them refuse him for a partner one or two of the Bullhead connection excepted who affect to turn up the nose at this extraordinary complaisance to a player  Adieu dear Sir And believe me sincerely your's G WESTWOOD  LETTER XVIII T STENTOR to J DRUMSHANDRUGH  Friend JAMES  I PROPHESIED what would come to pass I knew well enough how it would be This Alwyn leads the people in a string I foresaw itOld servants are forgotI hate such curst ingratitude but I never met with any thing else from the public even in my youth so I must not be surprized at it now I have been their slave long enough for nothing and now I may starve and be damned for what they careNot but I planned matters pretty well too The youth was staggered He was not used to stand fire and would have given ground at the first discharge if he had not been supported by the  pit I have been tolerably cautious and he has not the least suspicion it was I who directed the battery of hisses that was played off at him though some of my good friends in the company took abundance of pains to persuade him to such a beliefHe's a greenhorn a gull that will dive at a red rag instead of a herring I can do what I will with him for he believes me to be his best friend I would have him continue in that mistake while he continues in this company If I am not deceived I have already found a proper bait for the gudgeon He thinks me so faithful that he will say any thing to me trust me with any thing except one I cannot get out of him hitherto what he grieves about I observe he is always melancholy loves to be alone and take solitary walks sighs oftener than a weaver at a Methodist sermon  and looks as mournful as a friar on GoodFriday Perhaps he is in love if so I'll find it out  BE that as it may there is a certain lady of this town in love with him She sent for me t'other night to bribe me to assist her so you may think she is pretty far gone It seems the youth is shy and the lady impatient I'm glad I am called in for since I am to prescribe I'll take care not to neglect my fees She may prove a valuable patient and promises to bleed freely if I can accomplish her design which is to find out who the youngster is in love with for that he is in love she takes for granted and as I hinted I'm very much of her opinion She has given me a troublesome task but I have undertaken to perform it and it shall go hard but I will keep my word Nevertheless as there is no knowing what turn affairs may take I have sent my wife off  to join your company and thank you for the trouble you have taken in the matter She will give you this and my best wishes The Kendalians are all running wild after this Alwyn and come in shoals every night he plays They would be dd before they would come to see a better actor I may play to the benches now the whim has taken them A parcel of senseless sheep that will follow any bellweather if some fool only starts up and bids them admire his bleating He was invited to the assembly and I took great pains to persuade him to go I knew how it would turn out Some among them are affronted and though he's supported in his vanity by a few of what they call the heads of the town I'm devilishly cheated if he don't get a rap of the knuckles The party that is displeased talks pretty confidently of his vanity and assurance It was at  the assembly he made the conquest I have mentioned They say he dances to admiration and some are piqued because they thought themselves neglected and him too much admired The fellow is handsome enough and better bred than the boors of this place who notwithstanding fancy themselves great beaus and have as many ridiculous airs as any other petits maitres which with their aukward rusticity are laughable enough  ONE of these sparks a Mr Staple is a lover of the lady who is enamoured of our youngster and I shall take measures to inform him what a dangerous rival he has He was obliged to be out of town the night of the assembly and Alwyn by dancing with his mistress ingratiated himself so far in her favour that the absentee will stand a fair chance to have his congé He is one of those brutal headstrong  animals that are very apt to kick even before they feel the lash and two or three cuts will most likely make him quite resty Let me alone to give them I'll take care they shall sting As for the lady she does not seem one of your timid dames she is a widow a WestIndian with all the fire of the climate in her constitution and appears to have contracted a mighty strong antipathy to bashfulness in men If she can but attain her purpose she does not seem to be troubled with any conscientious scruples about the means I have provocations enough and materials are not wanting therefore if I don't make him pack up his boxes I'll forswear politics and go into leadingstrings Now I talk of provocations I must tell you that our dd flybynight rascal of a manager made me descend from Hotspur to Worcester t'other evening and because I ventured to remonstrate swore  I should not play another night in the company aye and was mighty positive about the matter too till the young favourite Alwyn inlisted on my side and then the old yelping hound was soon silenced This fellow who because he has had art and roguery enough to scrape together a few tinsel rags and a little daubed canvass is become as impudent and as consequential as a petty constable or a new made justice and much about as wise too He takes upon him to instruct the actors decides dogmatically upon any difficult passage without being able to read it settles the business of the scene without a thought concerning propriety and swells at the recollection of his own sagacity and importance like an alderman saying grace after meatA blunder of his the other night in the play of Harry the Fourth will give you an idea of his capacity  HIS eldest son Daniel who looks as stupidly goodnatured as a half grown mastiff played Sir Walter Blunt and his fatheaded father personated Douglas The termagant Scot as Falstaff calls him is to kill Sir Walter but when our puddingheaded director entered instead of slaying the knight his son he only stood to receive one thrust from him then tumbled upon the stage like an overfed porpoise gave a belch instead of a groan and pretended to expire It would have done your heart good to have beheld the stupid look of the cub Daniel who knew  he  ought to have fallen The prompter began to swear the people behind the scenes to laugh and the mother who lisps delightfully hearing an uproar waddled to see what was the matter she found the mistake and clapping her mouth to the side  of the scene began cursing her husband Roger in curious and wellchosen language"Get up" says she  Godth cuth your showl you old r  gething rathcul get up don't you know the child ith to die  "You lie you b" says Roger "I am to die"  Godth cuth your thoul I thay get up the child ith to die Dothn't the child do thir Walter and ith n't Douglath to kill him  Roger however persisted that he was to die and swore he would not get up After a while the spectators began to smoke the blunder and listen to the curious dialogue that was passing between the dead man and his persecuting wife You may be sure they enjoyed it and the house was presently in an uproar of laughter this rouzed the butterbrained Roger's recollection when finding himself in the wrong box he opened his eyes and after a tolerably  stupid stare which again incited the risibility of the audience assayed to get up But this was a task that he was not able to perform for he was little less than dead drunk so after two or three unsuccessful efforts he cast a maudlin look towards the wing and called in a kind of dismal hollow tone  Moll Moll I can't get up Moll  Godth cuth your old rogethin rathcul's thoul  answered Moll  Then lie there till the day of resurrection for what I care  Moll Molldo send the Prompter on and let him give Dan a lift with me  Godth cuth your thoul I'll crack your th'kul I will  replied Moll irritated at the shouts that were heard through the houseThe prompter however went on and Dan and he once more set him on his feet after which another battle ensued between Douglas and Sir Walter to the great diversion of the beholders  and Dan was slain amidst the clamour and acclamations of canes hands heels and voices  AS Mrs Stentor is but a very indifferent scribe and not the best reader in Europe I must beg of you to take the trouble of assisting her and sometimes writing for her in the correspondence which it may be necessary for her to hold with me and place it on the debtor page to the account of friendship In return she perhaps may be able to do some little matters for you any thing that she is able I know her too well to doubt of her being willing for notwithstanding that she has her whims and freaks as what woman is without them she has been a good wife to me and lent me many a lift She will be with you at the beginning of the week  Your's T STENTOR  LETTER XIX Mr STAMFORD Jun to Mr ALWYN  Dear HARRY  I HEAR with great pleasure though without surprize of the favourable reception you met with at Kendal and hope that you will pass your time very agreeably during the stay of the company at that place The party formed against you on your first appearance for a party it certainly was gives me some concern as I apprehend that the little malice of your rivals is capable of affording you more real uneasiness than misfortunes of a much more consequential stamp Fortitude can bear up against the latter but petty  insults and mean cowardly injuries are too often able to ruffle and sour the best turned disposition Pray let me have the satisfaction of hearing that I am mistaken and that you laugh at the mean tricks of your enemies  THIS solitary retreat affords very little matter for a letter unless I was to relate my excursions which though without variety of adventure are to me exquisitely pleasing In these delightful scenes I indulge the flow of fancy which the solemnity and stillness of the groves tend greatly to promote  Here melancholy give me oft to rove  And oft on ancient times the thought employ  Here let me every pensive pleasure prove  And far exclude each false each glaring joy  Ah what avails the strong the patient mind  That wooes coy science thro' the silent night  The sage's noble thirst ah why refin'd  In vain he toils to reach the envy'd height  What boots it tho' with patriot virtue fraught  The gen'rous hero for his country dies  He gives a life for those not worth a thought  And on the crimson field neglected lies  Were it not better in the secret shade  By fancy wrapt on shadowy scenes to dwell  To wander musing thro' the sylvan glade  Or sleep secure within the bushy dell  In simple guise are nature's wants supply'd  By many a plant the pale Recluse is fed  The chrystal stream will purest drink provide  And lonely caves afford the mossy bed  O grant ye pow'rs the cool the peaceful grot  Where waving cyprus sheds a solemn gloom  There let me live unknownBy all forgot  Till weary age conducts me to the tomb  Thus sung the Muse by discontent inspir'd  Whose sickening presence ting'd the groves around  False woes she sung with indignation fir'd  And for each virtue still an evil found  When lo Aglaia heav'nborn smiling maid  Serenely chearful fill'd the ravished sight  In waving robes of radiant hue array'd  And shone in all the majesty of light  Virtue said she nor haunts the gloomy cell  Nor joyless seeks the dark Cimmerian wood  'Tis not for man in solitude to dwell  To brood o'er woes or nurse the pensive mood  The smiles of plenty beam on nature's face  The shady alder props the burthen'd vine  For thee they bloom for thee the feather'd race  In chearing song their various notes combine  Man selfish man the object of thy scorn  Behold for thee his toil prepares the feast  His culture 'twas that did these groves adorn  For thee far hence he chas'd the savage beast  The hero diesBut not for sordid hire  His soul aethereal asks a better meed  A social motive feeds his gen'rous fire  Nor love of fame alone that makes him bleed  Whence did bold Curtius snatch the noble flame  That low in earth immers'd the glorious youth  Was it to purchase after death a name  Bestowed by chance more frequent than by truth  Say did firm Regulus severely great  Acquire his virtues in the hermitage  Or was that resolution fix'd as fate  Gain'd from the precepts of some cloister'd sage  Nothese the hermit knows not taught to dose  In torpid apathy his useless hours  He truly selfish seeks his own repose  In lonely caves and dark sequester'd bow'rs  Had all men pass'd their lives in sloth recluse  We ne'er had heard the poet's raptured verse  Silent had been the great Miltonian muse  And Shakespear ne'er had rival'd nature's force  Newton had never traced the comet's round  Nor e'er the varied threads of light unwove  The force aërial Boyle had never found  Nor Franklin seiz'd unharm'd the bolt of Jove  'Twas not in indolence supine retir'd  These greatly daring scann'd the azure dome  Their godlike minds with vast ambition fir'd  Long'd to anticipate their future home  Cease then of visionary bliss to dream  Let superstition seek the darken'd cave  The midnight cell or slowlywinding stream  Where shadowing cyprus boughs funereal wave  While swell'd with every social thought the mind  Public with private good delighted blends  With glad expansion seeks the bliss refin'd  And like the sun its influence extends  I MAKE no apology for inserting such a length of verse in a familiar epistle I think I have a sufficient one  when I acquaint you that this retirement affords few ideas but those of poetry and science I seem to be scarce an inhabitant of this worldor at least I fancy myself on the verge of another The past scenes of hurry and business strike my imagination as feebly as a dream and those speculations which the bulk of mankind regard as visionary appear to me in my present disposition the only things that have reality Sometimes with Mr Maitland I visit the planetary regions and admire the conjectures which his creative fancy makes of their uses or inhabitants From thence according to the enlarged idea of those great men who in a less enlightened age would have been deified I grasp in thought the amazing number of systems that fill the immensity of space and lose myself in the grandeur of the conception  The vast field of natural philosophy is a constant source of amusement which in these silent vales wears an aspect not dry and scientific but sublimely pleasing  BUT such elevations bear the mind so much beyond its natural pitch that it is impossible they should be continual Relaxation is necessary and in that relaxation I spend most of my time  Hic gelidi fontes hic mollia prata Lycori  Hic nemus hic ipso tecum consumerer Evo  Adieu C STAMFORD  LETTER XX Mr ALWYN to Mr STAMFORD Jun  Dear SIR  I HAVE had several adventures since my last to you which without any apology I shall take the liberty to relate from a supposition that as heretofore they will not be disagreeable to you having always observed with pleasure the part your passions took in the most trifling events when they any way influenced the affairs of those for whom you professed an esteem  I THEN informed you of the invitation I had received to go to the assembly I must now tell you of my weakness in suffering their persuasions to overcome  the resolution I had made not to comply with this invitation I believe I do wrong to ascribe it all to the force of persuasion The human heart has its foibles mine has however which I cannot always conquer I ascribed the remonstrances of my brother comedians to their little jealousies at the preference which had been given me this preference was flattering and though I endeavoured to combat that selfish idea yet it triumphed even while I despised it Not that I think any servile respect is due from the comedians to the inhabitants the case is the laws have unjustly empowered the daemon of persecution to assault the profession of a player Narrowminded people have taken advantage of this injustice and placed the professors at a distance which ignorance and arrogance at all times suppose they have a right to preserve  and the want of principle and abilities in the player too frequently justifies this usurpation The most uncultivated among the comedians get habitually and from the mere repetition of their parts refined notions which are several degrees beyond the sphere of the lower orders of the people with whom they are obliged either to associate or to seek the society of the dissolute and abandoned among the higher the respectable part of whom are stigmatized with want of decorum if they are known to hold any converse with men whom the law calls vagabonds Though this is a kind of life to which I already perceive I should by no means give the preference except as at present from motives of convenience yet my residence among these frequently unfortunate sons of the muses interests me greatly in their behalf and I have reason to hope from  that philosophical liberality of sentiment which prevails and so nobly dignifies the present age to see the time when none shall have the power and few the inclination to oppress those people who under proper regulations would be our best moral teachers  I DISCOVERED an additional proof of my weakness the instant I entered the assemblyroom It is necessary for every one in such a place to wear a face of mirth on the contrary my heart reproached me There is a delicacy in the sensations of a pure and respectful love to which the light sports of a mind not under its influence is often disgusting When I heard the sprightly notes of the pipe and tabor my feelings revolted against such quick vibrations and I felt an unconquerable inclination towards the penseroso I had consented to  go upon no other terms but those of forbearing to dance if I chose so to do Mr Westwood therefore who introduced me had not provided me a partner lest she should be disappointed As my evil genius ordained there was a lady whose partner had by some accident been detained and who could not dance for want of one I not knowing her motive for sitting still had entered into a slight conversation with her which had not continued long before the master of the ceremonies supposing probably I had an inclination to dance came and presented her hand to me and the lady not expressing any reluctance I could not be so unmannerly as to refuse though I believe I accepted the compliment with such an awkward and absent air that she must certainly perceive it The minuets were not over we were called forth and the lady though  not the youngest in the room moved gracefully enough and acquired a share of admiration equal to those who had gone before I perceived she was not entirely satisfied with my languor and made several goodnatured efforts to inspire me for indeed a heavy partner in dancing is a dull companion but they were ineffectual I was wandering through the haunts of Maria was discoursing with her gazing at her sighing for her and all the fiddles in England could not persuade me to leave such delightful company The lady's name who did me this honour is Vincent she is a widow a native of the West Indies and almost as great a stranger here as I am she is very handsome has an easy air a good shape and appears to be about thirty  DO not laugh dear Charles nor think me vain for what I am going to say I wish it were otherwise but in spite of my  ennui  I had the misfortune to please Mrs Vincent There is no danger to the lady's character from saying this to you and the remembrance of one whom I shall never forget reproaches me for suffering her passion although it is a thing out of my power to prevent except by a precipitate flight which I shall certainly make if I hear any more upon this theme After all it is an aukward situation for a man to whom love is tenderly and forcibly declared It seems exceedingly unnatural for him and almost shameful to reject the advances of a fine woman I believe it impossible except where as in my case the affections are totally preengaged for this reason when I have read the story of the young Israelite and the amorous Egyptian  I have been apt to conclude that beside the sin of ingratitude to his master which doubtless has great influence over a virtuous mind yet considering the force of the temptation which was almost too much for nature to support Joseph had certainly a mistress of whom he was enamoured  YOUNG Westwood appeared somewhat chagrined about my dancing though he endeavoured to hide it He told me that had I not professed a desire little short of a resolution not to partake of the amusement he would have provided me another partner  THE report that Mr Stentor was the person who was principally concerned in the opposition I met with on my first appearance was I am fully convinced without foundation His  partiality and attachment to me are evident and I find myself greatly in arrear to him for the attention he pays to my interests by every assiduity in his power I perceive the sneers of the other members of the company when he does me any little kindness and understand their sarcasms which imply that he has a farther design than is apparent but as he has no point to gain the supposition besides its malignancy is ridiculous I see no reason that we have to construe a friendly desire to please into officiousness and we all find in some degree a satisfaction in being loved and respected even though the object is beneath any claim of reciprocal affection But this is not Mr Stentor's case his understanding though clouded and embarrassed by a life of poverty is much above the level his temper is tractable and his  address insinuating not it is true without a small proportion of flattery and has at times the aspect of cringing but the first he corrects where he finds it displeasing and the latter is not to be wondered at when we consider the state of dependence in which he has constantly lived  I CAME here for country air and the improvement of my health but I fear I shall never become the rival of old Parr none of my waistcoats get too tight for me My cheeks improve rather in length than breadth and though the colour has not entirely forsook them yet it seems like an ambassador on the eve of a war in hourly expectation of departing I ought to beg pardon for speaking with so much levity upon a subject which though my situation renders it a light one to me yet is one  that your goodness and prejudice in my favour have made interesting on your part But forgive me suffer the smile of resignation and melancholy to sometimes steal a visit Yes Charles I will own life has no charms without Maria Death opens a friendly door for a harrassed fugitive and welcomes him to the mansion of repose Why then should I dread to enter Even Maria the lovely Maria whom all hearts doat on all eyes adore must soon take refuge there What is an hour a year a century They are all equal and Socrates and Shakespear are now no longer the conscious vehicles of wisdom and delight Where is the difference between a moment and a million of ages if the cold hand of death must at last put out the lamp Nothing but Maria could bribe me to wish for life and death as Dryden says  Is but  a black veil covering a beauteous face  Fear'd afar off by erring nature  tho'  But a harmless lambent fire  GOD bless you all I am going with this letter to the postoffice and then to take my usual solitary walk among the wilds of Westmoreland where pomp and luxury never yet had residence There is such a mixture of the grand terrible and beautiful and in so rich a style among these vales and mountains that I sometimes imagine I behold the spirit of Salvator Rosa sitting on a rock and contemplating the wonders of the sceneShakespear is you know my favourite poet and I never read him with more enthusiasm than in this place the scenery is so suitable to the elevation and grandeur of the subject that it seems enchantment and produces every possible  effectI have played Hamlet and am shortly to appear in Macbeth c c c Adieu  H H ALWYN  LETTER XXI Mr STENTOR to his WIFE  My DEAR  I AM much obliged to my friend Drumshandrugh for informing me of your arrival I told you it would be Tuesday night before you could get there but you always would be positive  MRS Vincent is as violent as ever and meets no obstruction capable of impeding her career She has had another tender scene with Monsieur Alwyn but he is made of strange metal  no penetrable stuff  according to her account He expresses himself differently  and fairly owns that if it had not been for a lucky interruption he is fearful his passions would have vanquished his resolution But he has escaped and seems determined to avoid from what he calls a consciousness of weakness such melting interviews for the future Though I can't help laughing at his stupidity I encourage his  virtuous whims  because they answer my purposes every way He wrote the next morning to the dying lady who has shewn me his billet It is a mighty genteel one full of compliments on her person and accomplishments but concludes with informing her that his affections are unalterably fixed and that he is fully resolved to quit Kendal the moment he hears any thing more about an affair which were he to pursue would sink him even beneath contempt Mrs Vincent  finding what she suspected was true  videlicet  that he is in love with another sent for me to consult upon the means of discovering who this other could be and we could hit upon none but that of purloining his pocketbook in which he keeps his letters and which I have often observed tossed in a careless unsuspecting manner among his things I pretended to start at an action like this and stated the ingratitude and almost impossibility of it though I believe it to be easy enough nor did I seem much more flexible when she mentioned a gratuity of ten guineas but when she afterwards came up to twenty I found my virtue mollified and pity pleading strongly in her behalf Accordingly upon the aforesaid conditions I have engaged to make the attempt and you may be assured I shall not fail to magnify the difficulty  of the task I do not for my part yet foresee what advantage it will be to her if she should make the discovery but she is a bold designer and revolves vast projects in her headShe desired to see my writing and after comparing it with Alwyn's asked me if I thought I could not imitate his hand You can't help remembering what a devilish situation I brought myself into the last time I practised this manoeuvre and to tell you the truth I have been plaguily startled at the recollection ever since Not that this ought to have too much weight with me for it is a trick that I have frequently practised before and with remarkable success I don't yet know her intention however I shall consider circumstances with some cautition in this case and take my measures accordingly  Adieu T STENTOR  LETTER XXII Mr STAMFORD Jun to Mr ALWYN  Dear HARRY  YOUR'S of the th was brought by the servant who conveyed my last to the postoffice Not having at that time any thing to communicate relating to my sister or the intended marriage I was silent on that point She and my father arrived here last Thursday he in good health but poor Maria very much altered The physicians have advised the country air and my father intends to leave her for some time as business requires his presence in town next week Her disorder it is feared will terminate in a consumption 'Tis of the mind and medicine vainly attempts  to relieve while the source of discontent remains A calm languor a settled melancholy has overspread her features and I am too well convinced will shortly convey her to the last state of repose if means be not found to prevent a union to which she is so averse  INTIMATE as our friendship has ever been I am apprehensive of shocking her delicacy if I should press her to a discovery of her passion but I am resolved to communicate my sentiments on this subject to my father who can with much more propriety enquire into the state of her mind His tenderness can surely never bear to see her miserable but will rather favour her inclinations when fixed on so truly estimable a character as that of my dear friend  Wednesday Night  THIS morning Mr Maitland being deeply engaged in his studies Maria very ill and Tom Maitland gone a shooting my father and I were left to entertain ourselves for which purpose we walked out together in one of the adjoining woods I had predetermined to reason with him on the subject of Maria's illness but he prevented me by introducing it himself  MY friend Maitland and I said he have long pleased ourselves with the hope of one day seeing our families united in Maria and his son But I now begin to be apprehensive that heaven has decreed otherwise Our inclinations are not always in our power The cool voice of reason may put a negative on the motions of passion if not applied to  too late but the will cannot cause an inclination where passion is absent Maria if I can judge dislikes Tom Maitland I do not wonder at it for I must confess that the more I see of him the less reason I find to admire him The levity of his mind which does not seem so much the effect of youth as of emptiness his disregard of every thing serious and that want of delicacy which appears in his ideas of domestic pleasures make me suspect him to be a libertine which if true would be enough to make me break off the treaty even if Maria was as strongly prejudiced in his favour as I believe she is against him But whether that be true or not it is sufficient that he is a person with whom my child can never be happy and in consequence I have resolved to defer their marriage till further circumstances shall either confirm or refute my  suspicions of his real character and the state of Maria's mind whose filial obedience I shall never take advantage of to make her unhappy  I ENTIRELY approved of his sentiments and resolution which I impart to you that you may share the satisfaction I find in the event I assure you I receive no small pleasure in anticipating the time that will make you both happy for such a time I am persuaded will come and that I am pleased at the thoughts of the joy the perusal of this will give you  I CONGRATULATE you on the conquest you made at the assembly which to any but you would afford either a ground for vanity or a prospect of interest But you are above either  of these and I hope notwithstanding all obstacles to see the constancy of your love rewarded I remain  My dear Alwyn  Your real friend C STAMFORD  LETTER XXIII Miss STAMFORD to Miss GOWLAND  My dear JULIA  MY papa and I arrived here last night Ever since we parted my health has been on the decline I am much altered since I had the pleasure of your company in town A listless dejection which I am incapable of overcoming has entirely sunk my spirits and makes every amusement tedious and disgusting Even music affords me no pleasure and my only consolation is that a very short time will put an end to my sufferings I am constantly haunted with the idea of Alwyn whom my fancy represents as pining with hopeless love Alas perhaps I flatter  myself and the remembrance of Maria is long since blotted from his mind I know your friendship will make you pity and not blame my hapless infatuationAnd sure to die is an atonement sufficient for my imprudence  MY papa will come to town next week He leaves me here for the benefit of the air as well as for the promotion of that union I tremble but to think of Young Mr Maitland is here but does not much trouble me with his company I believe he thinks it is disagreeable and I am willing he should if that would tend to prevent our marriage My dear brother is always with me If I walk out he accompanies me and by the happy turn of his mind makes these woods and lawns appear to the greatest advantage If I am confined to my chamber he is continually  there and by the tenderness of his behaviour gives me every day additional reasons to esteem him I see he wishes me to communicate to him the cause of my disquiet but forbears to ask lest it should make me uneasy And why should I not repose the secret in his faithful bosom I never had till new a thought that I did not share with him He is all mildness and I am sure would rather soothe than chide meAdieu my dear for the present I am quite tired and will finish this in the afternoon  Five o'clock in the evening  I WALKED out after dinner with my brother who seemed so particularly thoughtful that I could not help enquiring the reason You my dear Maria replied he are the cause of my  uneasiness I cannot bear to see you consuming with secret grief Is it the approaching change of life you fear Is Maitland disagreeable to you If so I am sure my father will never constrain your inclinations Is it love If it is I wish to know the secret only for your advantage if I cannot relieve your anxiety at least permit me to share it He spoke this with such a tender earnestness and my heart was already so full that I could no longer contain myself but burst into tears My dear sister said he leading me to an alcove compose yourself Unbosom your griefs and rely on me as your sincere friend there is nothing I shall not be happy to do to restore your peace When I had a little recovered from the agitation into which his address had thrown me I acquainted him without reserve with my love for Alwyn He told me  he had long since observed it and was not without hope that a future time would give Mr Alwyn those advantages his merit deserves but that for the present he could in confidence assure me that my papa was averse to making Mr Maitland his soninlaw and had resolved to break off the treaty the first opportunity  MY joy at this agreeable intelligence was excessive I thanked him for it with an emotion that evinced how pleasing it was to me while he enjoyed that pleasure which a generous and sympathetic heart receives from an occasion of exercising its benevolence  THE remainder of our walk was consumed in discourse about Mr Alwyn concerning whom he told me  strange things He is not at his mother's as we always understood he wasBut I will relate these matters some other opportunity I find myself much recovered in spirits since the morning I seem to myself as if just awakened from a long dream and already begin to enjoy the beauties of this enchanting retirement  OLD Mr Maitland has a number of particularities but is notwithstanding a very good man I shall have a thousand things to tell you about him when I see you I am  My dear Julia  Your's affectionately MARIA STAMFORD  LETTER XXIV Mr STAMFORD Jun to Mr ALWYN  Dear HARRY  I HAVE not mentioned my suspicions of Maria's regard for you to my father his disinclination to the present match having rendered it unnecessary Besides I was apprehensive of the consequences which there is no foreseeing in an instance of this critical nature But I have other news to acquaint you with that will I am convinced afford you much pleasure Our friendship and the high opinion I have ever entertained of your honour makes me tell you without scruple that Maria loves you and has confessed it No longer able to see her pining with secret anguish I pressed her to disclose the secrets of her bosom She has owned her love  and the apprehensions she was under from the present treaty I could not disapprove of a passion which I have always wished to see crowned with success but on the contrary informed her that her father was really averse to concluding the business with Mr Maitland and would take the first opportunity of breaking it off with honour This assurance has had a happy effect she has already began to recover her spirits and is quite another person compared to what she was a day or two ago  THE gloomy appearance of affairs begins to clear up Heaven that sees your mutual worth will not suffer it to languish without success I am elated with the hopes of calling my Alwyn by the endearing name of brother and of seeing my sister in the possession of him whom of all men I most esteem My  next letter will I doubt not contain more certain information and in the mean time I must assure you that no circumstance can place you higher in the estimation of  Your sincere friend STAMFORD  LETTER XXV Mr STAMFORD Sen to Mr SELDON  Dear SIR  I THOUGHT to have had the pleasure of seeing you in town previous to my setting out for this place but my daughter's health which was daily declining obliged me to hasten my departure I shall be with you in a few days as Maria already begins to improve and in the mean time if you should be inclined to adventure with me in the way I mentioned in my last our clerk Mr Simpson has instructions to do the needful on my part  THE connection I was desirous of completing between the son of our old  friend Maitland and my Maria does not bid fair to produce those good effects I hoped would arise from it The young man has many foibles and I fear faults all which are of that  omplexion that do not seem likely to wear off with time He has been at college where if I can judge he employed his time▪ more in distinguishing himself among the bucks of that place than in acquiring useful knowledge and he seems to think that the greatest merit consists in singularity and the power of raising a laugh In short he is a very empty young fellow and the more he is known the less he is esteemed Maria does not like him at all and as I am resolved not to force her inclinations I intend to decline forwarding the business though I must own it gives me much concern especially when I think how  much my good friend Maitland will be hurt by it  MY son is well and seems delighted with this pleasant country He makes his respects to you And I remain  Dear Sir  Your most obedient Friend and Servant J STAMFORD  LETTER XXVI Mr STENTOR to his WIFE  My DEAR  I HAVE a budget of news for you The pocketbook has been rifled and we have made the fatal discovery I did it mighty neatly I watched our youngster's time for his long walk which is customary with him every day then went up to his room on pretence of looking for him but with intent to see if he had left his cabinet of secrets behind him I mean his pocketbook and had the good fortune to find it  I RAN with my prize to my employer and she read while I wrote extracts and memorandums We were so expeditious  that I had replaced the book before the youth returned and I believe so carefully disposed the papers that it is not probable he should have any suspicion It was exceedingly lucky for I had gone several times before when he was out and could not find it I am of opinion that he usually takes it with him for it is an observation made by several in the town that he is often seen musing in the fields over letters and papers and the purport of what we have read confirms the conjecture  IT appears he is in love with his master's daughter with whose brother he holds a correspondence He has retired hither without the knowledge of his master who believes him to be with a relation for the recovery of his health These particulars known Mrs Vincent resolved to strike a bold stroke and inform  Mr Stamford Alwny's master of his love but lest that should rather retard than forward her scheme as from the milky temper of the old gentleman there is no knowing what turn the affair might take she has accused him of infidelity to the young lady and love to her and as there was no way so positive as that of shewing it under Alwyn's own hand she has bribed me rather unwillingly I confess to write a counterfeit loveletter as coming from Alwyn to her It is done in a bold stile and as she has managed the affair cannot fail of producing the desired effect which is to break off all connections between the Stamford family and Alwyn for the future  SHE has wrote an anonymous letter to old Stamford and enclosed the counterfeit loveletter which is so happy an  imitation that Alwyn himself would not by the writing disown it for his You will hardly suppose it was compunction for the youth that made me averse to the task my own personal security was the only motive of any weight with me and this kicked the beam when put in the scales of interest I am now the proprietor of sixty guineas a sum that the frowns of that presecuting bawd Fortunè who procures only for idiots has taught me to look up to with as much wonder as an ignorant sailor would at a gilt pagoda Some people perhaps who are gravely lolling at their ease would preach to me about conscience though at the same time if I wanted a morsel of bread would have the  conscience  to eat their dinner with a good appetite and let me starve The world has continually assaulted me and I have a right to make reprisals all men that I  have ever heard of agree that selfpreservation precedes every other consideration it does however with me This Alwyn came here and deprived me of my bread at least of my fame and must I be the pimp to his triumph let him look to himself he is mistaken in his man if he imagines me so foolishly tame  I HAVE another rod in pickle for him I told you I would take measures to inform Mr Staple the lover of Mrs Vincent what a rapid progress the youth has made in the affections of his mistress I have accomplished this business and it has had that kind of effect which I supposed Staple is bent upon mischief and revenge but he is none of your foolish hotheaded blockheads who because they have received an injury seek satisfaction in what is ridiculously called an  honourable  way  He is aware that the armour of honour was never yet found to be bulletproof He therefore goes me a wiser way to work and hires me two or three stout fellows who are to bestow the knout or the bastinado or some equally mild discipline upon him nay perhaps proceed a little farther if there should seem a necessity for such a procedure My emissary who tells me all this is to be an assistant and Ward the Town Bully who you know is the terror of the Kendalians the captain of the Blackguards and the leading man at elections is another They are to be reinforced by Staple and their plan is to hide themselves among the rocks where he usually resorts one of them is to be upon the scout and give notice of his arrival they are then to steal upon him unawares knock him down if he makes any resistance bind him and punish  him as their leader shall direct They are provided with disguises and intend to leave him bound after they have broken a few of his bones I hope there will be no murder because I confess that would be carrying even  my  revenge too far Not that I would have them tender upon the subject If he keeps his bed three weeks or a month he will find we shall be able to play without him and our booby of a manager will be obliged then to come capinhand once more to me  I CAN never mention this last fool without recollecting some of his absurdities He wants to have Shylock the Jew in the Merchant of Venice spoken in the dialect of Duke'splace and swears  Shakspur  intended it so He is seldom perfect enough in his part to be able to repeat two lines together  without the assistance of the prompter and when he blunders always lays the blame upon others  YOU know what a happy knack he has at mutilating The other night instead of  angels  he wanted  anglers  to visit his Cordelia's dreams  HE told the duke in Othello a messenger was arrived from the  gallows  instead of the  gallies  AGAIN instead of saying to Posthumus in Cymbeline  Thou basest thing avoid hence from my sight  He came spluttering on and bawled out  Thou bass string hence in a fright  HE seemed in an excellent mood in this play for discovering his talent  for when he should have said to Cloten  Attend you here the door of our stern daughter  he asked  Attend you here our daughter's stern door  But this to you who are so well acquainted with the booby is superfluousAdieu  T STENTOR  LETTER XXVII Mrs VINCENT to Mr STAMFORD Sen  SIR  THOUGH I have not the honour of a personal acquaintance with you yet as I have from many circumstances reason to think highly of your character I deem it a duty incumbent upon me to inform you how much your reputation is injured by one whom if I am not deceived it ill becomes to speak with disrespect of any part of your family  THE person alluded to is Mr Alwyn who boasts of connexions and interests with your children particularly your daughter which even if true  are of that nature which neither prudence nor gratitude admit of revealing His ingratitude is indeed too apparent and though want of prudence is almost venial in youth yet when it affects the peace and reputation of families the person who from motives of concern shall warn the unsuspecting of their danger will act consistently to those ties which ought to regulate society  I HAVE an additional reason for my conduct Being a party concerned I think myself insulted by the folly and vanity of this young man  THAT you may not suspect me of having any private pique any sinister design or mean resentment to gratify I have sent sufficient proof of the charge I make The enclosed letter addressed  to me under his own hand is an irrefragable witness His ingratitude in offering to expose the letters of his friend your son for which he had no reason but to convince me that your daughter was as he termed it dying for him put me beyond all patience Not that I am surprized at the young lady's partiality in his favour he has many specious qualities and art enough to ensnare the affections of an inexperienced heart especially one whose own rectitude will not let it mistrust the sincerity of others Before I was aware of his character or intentions I suffered him to visit at my house in consequence of the protection his plausibility had gained him among the young gentlemen of Kendal and supposing him from what observations a first or second interview had furnished me with deserving of better fortune than his connexion with a  company of travelling players could afford I am sorry since by his own account you have an interest in his welfare that I was so soon obliged to alter my opinion Indeed I did not imagine that because I treated him with respect he would therefore declare himself my lover nor when I found him so audacious that he would by such ungenerous means as those of pretending to sacrifice another and perhaps far more deserving lady to me endeavour to recommend himself to my favour  I DO not mean to write a dissertation upon his conduct but as I have from what I deem proper motives undertaken to inform you of it I thought it necessary to give my reasons for so doing His letter will best direct your feelings and a consciousness of having discharged my duty will satisfy mine  I SHOULD have subscribed my name but that I think it a disgrace to have any future knowledge of such an affair and would avoid all transactions of every kind hereafter with Mr Alwyn neither is there any necessity where the circumstances are so full and obvious For the same reason I have erased the superscription from the enclosed letterI am Sir as I would wish to be till a more eligible opportunity offers your unknown but respectful humble servant  LETTER XXVIII  The forged Letter  To Mrs  Dear MADAM  WHY will you suffer the humblest the most sincere of your adorers to languish in despair The repulse you last night gave my ardent and ungovernable passion has almost deprived me of reason Why too cruel fair do you delight in the misery of your faithful slave Yet why do I complain Had I ten thousand lives I would surrender them in obedience to your commands Suffer me to hope for an abatement of your rigour  IS it possible that my passion can be a matter of surprize to you To  you who are formed to inspire the most ardent love Can you reproach me with baseness in sacrificing another to the influence of your matchless charms Is not your irresistible beauty an excuse for a breach even of the most solemn engagements Ah cease angelic creature to blame me for the effects of a passion that is too strong for opposition  I CONFESS I was once slightly enamoured with a girl but never knew the force of love till I beheld your unrivall'd perfections She was the gentleman's daughter with whom I resided in London but she was forward and I was foolish It was a silly affair that I was apprehensive might become too serious for which reason I pretended that my health was declining and made that excuse to avoid a persecution from  the poor thing who I found expected me to tie an Hymeneal knot with her to which till this instant I have ever had the utmost aversion  IT is no wonder that I now feel myself all love all constancy all ecstacy and truth Who can think of another that looks upon you  TO convince you of my sincerity I will shew you this evening extracts or whole letters if you please from the brother of the above lady from which it will appear how easily I might succeed were fortune the only object of my pursuit Do but look with pity on my passion and I will instantly let this brother know how much he is mistaken when he fancies I love his sister which I should have done long ago but for some prudential reasons  I AM unhappy till I hear my doom from your dear lips and surely if they pronounce it I cannot doubt its kindness They were formed for pleasure and cannot twice give pain  THE bearer of this is my friend and of approved fidelity By him I hope to receive your permission to cast myself at your feet and to prove how entirely I am  Your most humble and sincere adorer H H ALWYN  LETTER XXIX Mr ALWYN to Mr HILKIRK  Dear HILKIRK  NOTWITHSTANDING the depression of spirits which I labour under an adventure has happened to me which has surprized me so much that I find an impulse strong enough to make me thus soon resume my pen and send you an account of it  THE romantic scenes which are so numerous in this country being exceedingly delightful and in unison with that kind of temper which I more particularly at present possess it had become customary with me to ramble  among them usually every day This I find has been taken notice of  WANDERING this morning by the side of a rivulet my accustomed haunt that washes a thousand rocky fragments and is kept in almost perpetual agitation by the obstruction it meets with I observed a natural cave in a rock upon its bank which had a winding narrow entrance The warmth of the day the gloom of the cavern and my inclination for repose all invited me to rest and I sat down in it Appearances made me conjecture this had heretofore been the silent retreat of some one who like me was devoted to melancholy In the spot that fronted it the bed of the brook was deep and its waters unruffled within was a seat upon the shelving of the rock a little worn where one might recline unseen and  listen to the warblings of the inhabitants of the lonely valley The light through several cavities just found sufficient entrance to enable me to read the roof permitted me to sit or stand upright and I began to regret that I had not sooner discovered a place so consonant to my taste  I HAD amused myself here for some time when I heard the voices of men and as I had no desire to be seen I sat still supposing they would soon be past They approached nearer and their language became distinct Judge of my surprize when I found myself the subject of the following conversation  DAMN him I'll be the death of himI'll murder him  WHOY if we murder him he'll  be sure never to foind us out dead men you know tell no tales  NO no I'll ha no consarn in murder noather Yow say he has affronted you and if yow want to be even with him by giving him a good sound beating why so I'll lend you a hond an I think he'll scarce be an overmatch for us aw three  AW three dom thee for a coward whoy I mysel would spin him tween my finger and thum loike a twopenny top An I suppooas if we were to give him two or three hard knucks that should chance to do his business thou ast sich a queeazy conscience thou'dst peach  NOdom the liarsBut howsomdever I doan't ought to be consarn'd in his death cause he gum me a  guinea to pay my quarter's rent and boy my woife a pare ashoon t'other day and which thou knowst thou holp me spend cause my landlord here promised to forgee me th'rent and sumat beside for this job  AYE ayeI'll forgive thee th'rent provided thou dost not spare his bones for by I'll scarce leave life in himI'll teach him to come to assemblies and dance with other folks mistresses an make love out of playbooks damn him I'll 'noint his carcase  AS soon as we see him cumin we'll put creeap o'er our feaces and hoide till we can fall on him and then if we think he kens us weest coot his tongue out to mar his telling who hurt him  HIS tongue what matters his tongue he can write can he notI'll warrant he can write loveletters Make an end of him damn him make an end of himI'd stick my knife to his heart for a farthing I'd kill him with a better heart than ever a butcher kill'd a calf  FROM two or three circumstances in their discourse it was that I discovered myself to be the subject of it I looked through an aperture of the rock and perceived they were armed with short bludgeons which I suppose they had precaution enough to hide under their coats while they thought there was any danger of being seen and considering the intentions and strength of the enemy I concluded myself happy in being thus secreted from their sight This however was no security they  were acquainted with the place and one of them perceiving somebody coming along the winding of the valley which they supposed to be me they proceeded to enter the cave What added to the horror of my situation was that their leader being intent upon an evil action and subject I suppose to a thousand apprehensions drew a large knife and was the first that approached the cavern  THE moment I beheld my enemy advancing my anger at the perfidious manner in which he sought revenge for a supposed injury of which I was innocent added to the abhorrence of being murdered made me forget all fear and darting from my seat I seized the knife and with one effort laid him at my feet The guilt of his conscience and my unexpected appearance and assault terrified him so much that instead of  giving any proofs of ferocity he roared for mercy in the most abject manner  I DID not stay any longer with him but snatching his club attacked his associates and by a successful blow levelled one of them with the earth The more desperate talker and him who was so ready to accuse the other of cowardice took to his heels He did not escape thus I sprang over the fallen assassin and pursued him and his foot tripping I caught him almost instantly He rose and endeavoured to make some resistance but I had the good fortune to prove victorious  I HAD scarce made this conquest when I perceived young Mr Westwood with his fishing rod who seeing me thus engaged  ran immediately to my assistance I desired him to guard this ruffian while I went to secure Mr Staple the leader of this glorious enterprize the other associate I perceived had fled out of my reach and has not been heard of since  AS I came to the cavern I heard Staple groan shockingly I therefore desired Mr Westwood to come up and assist me in bringing him from the mouth of the cave he being just in that part of it where there was not light enough to discover in what condition he was accordingly having bound the other with a rope which was tied round his own waist and which I suppose was intended for my use we went to Staple who continued utttering groans and exclaimed that he was a dead man  WHEN we had brought him to the light we found he had a contusion on the eye which from the violence of the blow had swelled prodigiously but what was worse in falling his arm was broken by pitching in the crevice of a rock  I NOW found all my anger turned to pity and therefore forebore to upbraid him I was not inclined to be quite so merciful to the accomplice I knew if I accused him before a magistrate the affair must become public I therefore bestowed a little discipline upon him though not quite to the satisfaction of Mr Westwood and suffered him to depart  WE conveyed Staple almost to Kendal in the best manner we were able  and he made so many mean concessions and begged of me to forgive him so often that I told him he might invent what tale he pleased and tell it his own way for that I should not contradict it and prevailed at last on Westwood to make the like promise accordingly I hear he reports that he has been robbed and ill treated by a thief among the mountains  JEALOUSY it seems prompted him to commit this outrage I had danced with his mistress at an assembly and she has been unkind to him since which he attributes to her partiality for me but as I have by no means encouraged her in such a partiality I am not to be accountable for her caprice however as it is an affair that I did not wish to hear any thing about in the presence of Mr Westwood I did not ask for any explanation  nor did he offer any unless his apologies for his conduct may be so termed  I AM not so violently attached to my present employment as I imagined I should be There is so much of the labour of a schoolboy requisite that before the words are learnt by rote the imagination is wearied the enthusiastic fire which the first reading of the poet inspires is evaporated and the fancy becomes jaded by repetition The false or dull conception too of the generality of the performers is exceedingly teizing I do not think to continue here long and the above adventure will rather quicken than retard my departure I have flattering accounts from young Mr Stamford that would almost make me think of returning to the family  My heart is with them but I dare not indulge my hopes should they prove false it would only increase a disorder that is already too violent Adieu  H H ALWYN  LETTER XXX Mr STAMFORD Sen to Mr ALWYN  SIR  IF I were conscious of having ever acted in the least respect otherwise to you than as a father I should have been less surprized at the transaction that compels me to trouble you with this Your father was the worthiest of men and the thought that I was repaying in a slight degree the obligation I owe to his friendship added to the merit I fancied I saw in you gave me a satisfaction that more than amply counterbalanced the benefits you received from my protection and care I can never express the pleasure I daily experienced in beholding the image of  my dear Alwyn renewed in his son With a truly paternal joy I perceived the seeds of every virtue unfolding themselves under my instruction and cherished the fond hope of seeing them come to maturity But I am forced to give up the expectation  THINK Alwyn if your soul is not grown callous to every sentiment to every feeling that dignifies mankind Think what I suffer in relinquishing the darling wish I am now old my connexions drop off few of the friends of my youth remain but I indulged the hope of seeing Alwyn among my children one of the supports of my age I can ill afford to lose the blessing but perfect felicity is not attainable in this life and I must submit But I must confess that I submit with pain and reluctance  OH Alwyn much rather would I have followed thee to the grave than seen the proofs of yesterday When did I injure you What has Maria done Base ungrateful wretch To wound me in the tenderest part If I had not fostered you in my bosom you had wanted power to sting Could not your vile schemes be carried on without sacrificing your father and your friend  MY children are distracted at your perfidy and nothing but the most direct the most positive proof of your baseness could have prevailed on me to adopt the belief  OH thou fair outside painted shew of every virtue but real sink of every vice In future no villainy however great shall shock my belief for if  Alwyn can smile at the fond credulity of the friend that loves himIf he can blast the fame of an innocent girl whose greatest fault is to esteem him If he can wound the heart of an old man whose solicitude for his welfare has equalled that which he had for his own children what wickedness will he not readily accomplish  GO false wretch if thou hast a conscience hell is within thee and if that monitor exists not proceed in thy career Heaven is just and hypocrisy and ingratitude so complete cannot long miss their proper reward  J STAMFORD  LETTER XXXI Mr ALWYN to Mr STAMFORD Jun  FOR God's sake my dear friend let me know what I have done Have I really lost every friend I esteemed in the world Pray send me word without loss of time This stroke exceeds the utmost misery my imagination ever painted O rather far rather would I have chosen the silent grave and my dear more than father's lamentations than this dreadful this mysterious letter I am sure 'tis his handHe calls me base ungrateful wretch But heaven is my witness how much he is deceived Can I wrong your angel sister The man lives not that could do itHer  native virtue is a guard not to be sinned against And Oh my friend is it possible for me to smile at your simplicity Believe me I could weep at your misfortunes I could give my life to serve you but never was capable of deriding the friend of my heart  BE faithful to me in this excruciating instance Explain to me the dreadful  proofs of yesterday  I HAVE read the letter so often that the intensity of the thought has quite overcome me and yet can make nothing of itIf your father is angry at my becoming a player still the crime is unequal to the reproachMaria My friendMy fatherSacrificed Is it possible Oh no no I am distracted with the hurry of passion in my  breast Love friendship gratitude have I offended all Miserable wretch that I am If the most unremitted ardour the most respectful silent suffering passion be to blast the fame of the divine Mariathen alas I am guilty If perfect esteem and the confidence of every the least movement of my soul be to betray my friend then have I done it And if daily to implore heaven to shower its choicest blessings on the head of my benefactor if that be to wound his heart then am I ungrateful  NEVER did I think my dear Stamford to receive so keen a torment from the hand of my dearest friend and patron The lightening of heaven would have been a more welcome visitant Let me hear from you if friendship  has no plea at least for pity let me have a line  I am Your real and grateful friend ALWYN  LETTER XXXII Mr ALWYN to Mr HILKIRK  Dear HILKIRK  I AM overwhelmed with misfortunes I have received a letter a fatal one to me that informs me I have totally lost the friendship of the Stamford family I am unacquainted with the cause and bewildered in amazement and sorrow It is wrote by Mr Stamford senior and complains bitterly and pathetically of my ingratitude Nothing could add to my unhappiness but a consciousness of guilt God only knows my heart and how much I would undertake to serve or convince them of my affection or how industriously I would avoid injuring or giving them pain I am accused  of breach of friendship and want of love and delicacy for Maria but in such a vague and enigmatical though possitive stile that I am at a loss in what manner to interpret it Perhaps the old gentleman is offended at my becoming a comedian without informing him of my intention Yet surely this offence could not merit nor authorize the accusations I have received  THE more I reflect the more I am surprized and afflicted Mr Stamford is cautious to a degree how he believes any thing to the disadvantage of another and when convinced is ever ready to make the most generous allowances for the infirmities of human nature He has found out my love for his daughter perhaps this doubtless is disagreeable to him but I am certain this nor no  other motive could induce him to swerve from the path of integrity nothing but positive conviction could make him accuse me in the manner he has done and yet it was impossible he should have that What can be the cause I have no enmity to any one I obstruct no one in his prospects of happiness or pleasure I am not of importance enough in this ambitious world to annoy any one sufficiently to make him my enemy or if I were who could give malice a colour strong enough to convince the good the generous Stamfords of the reality of my supposed guilt It is the utmost weakness to harbour such a suspicion and nothing but my present incertitude and distress could excuse me in making such reflections  I HAVE wrote to Mr Stamford junior but as I am certain of the justice of his  father's proceedings and how thoroughly he believes himself convinced of the truth of his assertions by what strange means I know nor I expect only a further confirmation of my misfortunes Oh Maria Forgive me dear Hilkirk my tears will not let me proceed  I COULD not finish this letter yesterday I found myself so ill and my brain so near a state of frenzy that I was obliged to use my utmost endeavours to calm my disturbed imagination I am little better to day I have received a letter from young Mr Stamford in answer to mine that thoroughly confirms my prediction The thing that I am most uneasy at is they have not told me what their allegations are founded on Perhaps the explanation is what they seek  to avoid and I will rather suffer in silence than urge them to any thing that would give them pain It is enough for me that I am innocent I shall soon have no remembrance of injuries or the injured I find myself in the road that leads to everlasting rest and this only is my hope my consolation It is impossible I should ever possess the only object that could make the small remainder of time my youth might promise glide away in tranquillity and joy and surely to be released from misery is a pleasure  I SHALL quit this place directly and travel on foot across the country to my dear mother in Oxfordshire I am daily receiving proofs of her maternal tenderness and I wish to die in her arms I shall endeavour to hide my griefs from  her and from the world in which while I continue you my dear Hilkirk shall be certain of a place in the grieved heart of  H H ALWYN  LETTER XXXIII Mr STAMFORD Jun to Mr ALWYN  SIR  WHY do you continue to laugh at us You cannot surely pretend to say that my father's letter is enigmatical to you It is not necessary to inform you by what means we received the intelligence of your perfidy it is enough that you cannot but be conscious of having betrayed your friend and that in the point on which the peace of our family in a great measure must depend  YOUR proceedings are discovered You can therefore have no end to serve and an attempt to deceive must now be the effect of mere wantonness  But the peace of families is not a thing to be sported with especially after such transactions as have passed between you and us It hurts me to be reduced to the necessity of noticing this which nothing but the shamefulness of your behaviour could have forced from me but to prevent any correspondence on so disagreeable a subject I am to inform you that my father and myself desire to have no farther connexion with or application from you and that Maria is possessed of strength of mind enough to blot from her remembrance so unworthy a character  C STAMFORD  LETTER XXXIV Mr MAITLAND Junior to STAFFORD OSBORNE Esquire  Dear OSBORNE  I AM much concerned to find that your letter in answer to my two long ones is not come to hand and can attribute it to no other reason than  its not being yet wrote  If that is the case I must make bold to inform you that I shall not turn historian  gratis  but shall expect an ample return for the narratives I transmit to you from time to time But I don't believe I shall trouble you with many while I continue in this place We hold scarce any sublunary intelligence I could favour you with an account of the number of patches the sun had on his face when he rose this  morning or let you know the length of Venus's horns which by the bye shews how different the mode in that country is from ours I should have expected to have seen the patches upon Venus and the horns upon Mars  BUT if these sublime disquisitions are above your comprehension you are to know that we are not always  super ethera  We have a hen or two that are constantly employed in the business of incubation by whose assistance though we are not sanguine enough to hope we shall ever arrive at the art of making chickens yet we think much may be done by way of meliorating the species My father thinks it necessary to proceed  usque ab ovo  on account of a difficulty he found last winter in attempting to produce hair instead of feathers on their bodies To accomplish which desirable effect they were divested of their natural habiliments  and kept for some weeks in a room on a grass diet a regimen that is said to have produced the same phaenomenon in the person of king Nebuchadnezzar But whether to the inclemency of the season which prevented the experiment succeeding so well here as at Babylon or to what other cause the failure might be attributed certain it is that they all died just at the time when there was all the reason in the world to expect a favourable conclusion of the business  THESE are misfortunes you'll say and so they are but we bear them with philosophic resignation  MY father has made a capital acquisition in young Stamford who accompanies him in all his projects and enquiries and I assist very often for want of better employment  A LITTLE below our house on the other side of the river the bank rises with an ascent rather steep and is covered with hazle and other trees At this time of the year after rain the  ignes fatui  or  willwiththewisps  are frequently seen descending towards the water and you may be sure do not pass unobserved by us The other night we were all three standing on the bank when a particularly brilliant one made its appearance My father who is very active for his years skipped from stone to stone and was on the other side in a trice Mr Stamford followed and I not willing to be singular went after but my evil genius had so contrived it that stepping on a smooth stone I slipped into the water over head and ears This sudden immersion effectually cooled the ardour of our pursuit Stamford helped me out with some trepidation  and my father returning assured me that my misfortune was entirely owing to a due equilibrium of the center not being preserved However happy this elucidation might be I did not find myself disposed to admire it but walked home rather out of temper resolving to set his philosophical acumen to work on other business For which purpose I ordered Sam to accommodate my dog Pompey in the stile of an  ignis fatuus  and lead him about the lower grove at the time my father generally repairs to his observatory He accordingly fixed six small lamps to a kind of saddle which he fastened to the dog's back and made a most shining appearance  GADSO says my father turning the large reflecting telescope towards it a very peculiar kind of meteor  WHAT is it like says Stamford There seem to be three distinct lights following each other at a very small distance apart  LET us go to it said I and thereupon we sallied forth  OUR pursuit lasted full two hours at the end of which we pressed Sam and his meteor so hard that he was under the necessity of extinguishing his illuminations which of course obliged us to return home unsatisfied  YOU see what shifts I am reduced to to keep myself alive and likewise the difficulty of furnishing matter for a letter but you who are in the midst of whim and jollity can have no excuse for delaying to write Adieu  Your's c T MAITLAND  LETTER XXXV Mr MAITLAND to STAFFORD OSBORNE Esquire  Dear OSBORNE  WE have several times hunted the meteor since my last and are now just returned from the chace which has been unsuccessful more ways than one  THOUGH Pompey may be justly called a dog of a liberal education and some genius which is evident from his peculiar address at fetching carrying and other operations of that nature yet it must be confessed that his talents are by no means universal For this reason it was I suppose that he did not succeed capitally in exhibiting the  ignis fatuus  I am even inclined to suspect that Sam was the superior agent of the two or to express myself more scholastically he was the soul of the machine and Pompey the body or  visible substance  The learned tell us souls and bodies are sometimes apt to fall out and this remark was exemplified in the present instance In spite of Sam's attention and care his animal part to wit the dog was actuated with a strong desire to emancipate itself from controul which it has accordingly effected  I AM apprehensive that he will come home with all his meteorological apparatus about him and by that means discover our plot but have ordered Sam to wait an hour for his arrival Adieu Supper waits I'll finish the rest in the morning  Friday Night  I AM distractedlostundone and have involved my father in my misery That infernal dog came home and set fire to the house Maitlandhall is now a heap of rubbish and my father's strong box is lost Good God The torture of reflection is intolerable I am torn by a thousand passions at once My poor father is quite calm and resignedHe does not blame meBut his lenity cuts my heart more than the keenest reproaches I am astonished at the folly of my past life  CAN it be possible that a being possessed of reason should pass whole years in worse than indolence Yes 'tis too true for I am that being The conflict of passion is too violent for nature to support It must end in the loss of  reason or of life Be it so for existence is burthensome  THE only good act of my life was the cultivation of your friendship Your virtues engaged me and even now despairing sick of the world and quitting it the last effort of my mind is employed in bidding you an eternal farewel  Your lost friend T MAITLAND  LETTER XXXVI Mr STAMFORD Sen to Mr SELDON  Dear SIR  A TERRIBLE accident has prevented my coming to town this week as I intended Maitlandhall is burnt to the ground Happily no lives were lost but Mr Maitland has suffered very much in his property to the amount of nearly all he was worth The fire began in his elaboratory by Tom Maitland's means but in what particular manner I have not yet had time to enquire  ABOUT one o'clock in the morning we were alarmed by a neighbour who was providentially crossing a footpath that leads by the house I started up immediately  but the suffocating smoke with which my chamber was filled overpowered my senses and I fell again on the bed What followed I was unconscious of but about an hour after I found myself in a chamber at the vicar's and Charles sitting beside me  THE idea of the fire was still predominant in my mind but I was unable to determine whether I had dreamt or the misfortune had really happened Where am I exclaimed I where's my Maria Let me know Charles is my poor child lost How came I here Compose yourself dear Sir replied he Maria is safe a stranger preserved her life at the risque of his own  AND where is this heavenly stranger Bring him to me Let me at least acknowledge the debt since I never can  repay it He knows not the value of the blessing he has bestowed But tell me Charles how all this happened I remember the alarm of fire when the smoke overcame me but have no knowledge of the rest  I WAS rouzed said he by the outcries of the servants and the thought of your danger rushed instantly into my mind I flew to your chamber one side of which the flames had already seized The urgency of the occasion gave me a strength which at another time it would have been impossible for me to have exerted I seized you in my arms and conveyed you hither When my terror and apprehensions for your safety were somewhat subsided I recollected Maria and in the utmost anguish hastened back to the scene of desolation Two of Mr Moreton's servants accompanied  by my man Will were bringing her to this place in a chair My dear Will said I in a transport how can I reward you for saving my sister  No Sir  replied he  it was not I It was an angel that snatched her from the middle of the fire for to be sure he was sent by heaven to save my mistress The roof fell in the moment after I asked him to stay but he would not he went away towards next town  Will is now gone by my order to intreat him to return  WHILE Charles was speaking his servant entered the room  "HE won't come" said Will  he won't come I told him my master long'd to see him but he hung his head and sighed as if he would break his heart Poor young gentleman  I thought mayhap he believed somebody was burnt so I told him all was safe and that 'Squire Maitland was safe and you Sir was safe and every body was safe but for all that he would not speak At last he said it was impossible and that he was a wretch and had lost all his friends but that he hoped he should die soon and forget his miseries And so I believe he will for he looked so pale and so thin and his eyes were so hollow that my heart aches to think of it I could not help crying when he walked away he seemed so disconsolate What a pity he should be sad or sorry I wish I could help him I'd go to the end of the world to help him  POOR Will's heart was full He could not proceed and Charles who  had sat silent with the tears in his eyes seemed lost in the sympathy of his affections  MERCIFUL heaven exclaimed he rising are the severest calamities reserved for thy favourites O that he had returned How happy we should have been to have supplied the place of his lost friends and alleviated his sorrows  TO prevent his dwelling on an object which afflicted him without being of service to our benefactor I desired him to enquire how Mr Maitland and his son did while I rose and went to Maria She was sitting in the arms of Miss Moreton and her maid who with some difficulty kept her in bed  "WHERE's my papa" Cried she struggling  you would let me see him if he were safe No no he is dead and I will die too We will go together  "MY child" said I sitting down beside her  look at me I have escaped the flames  "IS it true" Replied she looking at me with great earnestness  no you deceive me you are not my papa  A seasonable flood of tears ensued which restored her so much that she knew me and enquired after Charles I related the particulars of the event as concisely as possible and advising her to rest left her in the care of Miss Moreton  I THEN walked to the site on which Maitlandhall had stood where I found Mr Maitland and Charles surveying the ruins From the composure which appeared in the countenance of my old friend I did not apprehend his loss to exceed that of the house and furniture but on enquiry he informed me his strong box containing notes and securities for upwards of fifty thousand pounds being almost all he was worth was missing But said he to a philosopher this is of little consequence I can bound my appetites and enough is left If I lose my tranquillity it will be a greater loss than that I have just now sustained Tom must choose one of the professions to live by and it is not impossible but the employment of raising a fortune may prove much more innocent than that of spending one  I TOOK this occasion to tell him that I had no intention of breaking off the treaty on account of the alteration this misfortune would make in his son's circumstances and he in answer said he expected no less from the confidence he reposed in my integrity When I consider the sincerity of his friendship to me and the proofs he has given me of it I cannot bear the thought of refusing my daughter at this time It carries with it a mark of baseness not to be endured Perhaps this disaster may give a new turn to Tom's mind and make him more worthy of my girl If so all will be well and this shocking circumstance will bet productive of good I hope to hear that your affairs go on to your satisfaction and am with perfect esteem Sir  Your most obedient Friend and Servant J STAMFORD  P S  My son is gone to town to give notice of Mr Maitland's loss at the public offices and will be with you before this letter comes to hand  LETTER XXXVII Mr ALWYN to Mr HILKIRK  Dear HILKIRK  I ARRIVED at my dear mother's this day week and if I were capable of pleasure should receive it from the joy and tenderness she expressed and her assiduity to make me happyYou can scarce imagine what my feelings are or what such a mother deserves I am afraid she should remark the gloom that possesses my mind I know how much it would distress her I therefore make very severe struggles to smother my sighs and am resolved as much as is in my power to carry my griefs abroad and without a figure complain to the pitiless winds  MY life seems fruitful in adventures and strange incidents I am at this moment oppressed and agitated with the recollection of one which has happened to me on my journey I know you will excuse my impertinence in continually talking thus of myself I am not at present in a state of sufficient tranquillity to make observations on objects which used to amuse me I find myself at moments not many degrees from insanity and the affliction this would cost my mother even more than the horror attending it makes me use my utmost endeavour to forget my troubles and ward off the blow My efforts I fear will be ineffectual though I assure you I have tried every method I read I run I walk and make various efforts to divert my ideas from the channel in which they so constantly flow My mother appears distrustful  at times tells me how frequently I talk in an incoherent manner especially in the night and I have caught myself more than once singing aloud without any meaning I hope however I shall conquer this disposition Could I forget MariaAlasIt is impossibleOh memoryOh Maria  I WILL endeavour to tell my story Maria has a part in it  I DEPARTED from Kendal on the day and in the manner that I had proposed I travelled four days without being scarcely able to recollect whether I had passed through towns or villages had met men women or other objects except such as immediate necessity had obliged me to notice and was walking very late on the fifth I suppose it might  be almost midnight for I knew the country and was so lost in thought that I did not think of rest when casting my eyes accidentally up at the noise of an owl that flew by me with a dismal howl I perceived at a less distance than a quarter of a mile from the roadside a house in flames I had forgot at that moment where I was but made the best of my way towards the place The shrieks of the people were piercing and made the natural stillness of the night awfully shocking It was exceedingly dark and the wind rather tempestuous with a sharp cutting rain while the blaze cast a horrid gleam upon every object around I don't remember to have ever been struck with so much terror I ran I flew I intermixed with the frightened sufferers who were running to and fro in the utmost confusion and I thought  I saw by the pale glare some faces that I knew  IMAGINE what my sensations were when I beheld a young gentleman bearing an old one in his arms through the flames and immediately knew them for young and old Mr Stamford but how was my horror increased when I heard a voice crying aloud  OH my mistress my mistress my poor young mistress she will be burnt she must be burnt her chamber is on fire    "WHOSE chamber" said I  Maria's chamber    OH yes yes my poor dear young lady    "WHERE is it shew me the way" said I in the most horrid agitation  THE servant flew to conduct me and regardless of the flames which had spread over the apartment I burst open the door darted through them snatched up my dear Maria in my arms and without feeling any thing from the fire bore her down stairs harmless and out of danger  OH God how can I describe what I feltI could hardly persuade myself at first that she was safeI viewed the spreading blaze I turned to Maria I sighed with excess of emotion I held my Maria in my armsShe had swooned in the fright and did not know me no one was near us the servant had ran for waterIn the transport of my joy  and passion I imprinted a kiss upon her lipsHow could I support it I was under the power of a wild and tumultuous extacy and surely the sin was venialOh that I had died at that instant  THE servant returned Maria began to revive I was unwilling to be known and committed her to his care I had preserved the jewel of my soul and perceived I could be of no farther service I heard the younger Stamford uttering distracted cries for his sister and resolved that he should not know his benefactor if I could prevent it I therefore made the best of my way into the high road again His sister was restored to his arms and he was  impatient to thank and reward the author of her safetyI am acquainted with his grateful dispositionHe dispatched the servant who had observed the route I took and who presently came up with me The poor fellow had an honest and a tender heart and begged of me with tears in his eyes to go back with him to Maitlandhall  "DEAR Sir" said he  come with me do SirLet my old master and my young master thank youMy dear young mistress will thank you tooI am sure she willShe is the dearest best young lady in the world  MY eyes overflowedI uttered something incoherently about impossibilities and unhappiness and the honest servant appeared very much affected  with my manner which I dare say was rather wildI was agitatedI wished ten thousand things that I perceived the folly of and the tumults of my mind occasioned me to betray some weakness  IT was not without difficulty that I persuaded the servant to return and when he parted from me he said he was sure his young master and his old master and his dear lady too would be very sorry for they had charged him to bring me back if he could find me  I FELL into so profound a reverie in ruminating upon this accident that when I came into the road I never observed which way I turned and instead of proceeding on my journey  travelled back again I did not discover my mistake till daylight appeared and I had got near twelve miles when finding the servants up at a waggoner's inn and myself exceedingly weary I went to bed and rested myself till eleven the next day The news of the fire was presently spread all over the country and almost every one told a different tale They all however agreed in some particulars namely that Maitlandhall was burnt to the ground that old Mr Maitland had lost an iron chest in which was contained bank notes to a great amount and that a stranger had saved the daughter of Mr Stamford from being burnt alive by carrying her down the stairs when they were all in a flame of fire You may be certain I took all the precautions in my power to avoid being known and  for that purpose left the road and travelled along by a path among some villages on the contrary side from Maitlandhall Adieu dear Hilkirk  And believe me to be Your sincere friend H H ALWYN  LETTER XXXVIII Mr SELDON to Mr STAMFORD Sen  My dear Friend  YOUR account of the dreadful fire at Maitlandhall affected me exceedingly I rejoice however to observe that you all escaped safe as the other misfortune admits of a remedy in affording which I shall be happy to assist Please to let Mr Maitland know how sincerely I condole with him on this unhappy business and that I only wait his directions to do all in my power for his service  I AM in your debt for a former letter in which you deplore the baseness and ingratitude of young Alwyn It is a  piece of news that I assure you I heard with some regret for I always entertained the highest opinion of the young man's principles But you and I have lived long enough in the world to be surprized at nothing It might have been better but useless grief can only make it worse therefore let him go unlamented If conscience has no power to torment him yet we may take it for granted that in the end his ingratitude will meet its reward  YOU say he is become a player A profession that in my opinion contains the extremes of good and bad The sublime and forcible lessons of morality with which our dramatic pieces abound scarcely permit the inculcator to stand neuter He must either assent to them with that warmth which characterizes the good and great man or by a most  despicable excess of hypocrisy counterfeit and  seem  to feel that virtue to which his mind is a stranger According to this latter mode Alwyn I believe will make a good player and I think it is fortunate that this situation in life will not allow him to exercise his talents for deception in a sphere of greater consequence  NOW I talk of players you are to know that I have received a very good account of my youth in the country which helps to convince me that my plan is good though it has had the misfortune not to meet with your approbation Weak plants you say must be brought forward with care The keen blast of adversity blights them and they never come to maturity My philosophy says otherwise it is that very care that makes them weak both in mind  and constitution My boy will arrive at affluence with a mind that has withstood the shocks of misfortune and will enjoy his independence with the more pleasure as he is better acquainted with its value I am impatient to see him and to make Julia happy Her ready acquiescence in every thing I proposed for her advantage deserves whatever recompense I can bestow and her merit will secure the happiness of my son  I am dear Sir Your real friend and servant R SELDON  LETTER XXXIX H HANDFORD  Esq  to Mr WESTWOOD  Friend GEORGE  WHAT right had you to impose such a tax upon your goodnature as to promise to hold correspondence with and pay visits to an old humourist A fellow who has taken it into his head that all the world himself excepted are little better than blockheads jostling in the dark running their noses in each others faces and swearing there is no room for them to walk with ease and dignity as it befits their worships nay who confesses he himself cannot see because of a profusion of light but like an owl  can fly farthest by twilight You have some degree of rationality How could you be such a booby I am a techty old batchelor Sir and you knew it I have neither wife nor daughter for you to seduce I am rich but I told you and I tell you again I shall never give to those who don't want  I WONDER what such fellows as I do crawling between heaven and earth  No child no relation to flatter my old age and make me believe I shall exist after I am deadIf I were to build churches or endow hospitals men would swear vanity was my only motiveWell if they did there would be no perjuryI wish they could always indulge their envy with as little danger to their consciencesBetween you and me we are little better than a set of sad dogsRascalsLiars  I'll take my oath to hypocrites You are a young man and

hey dayWhat the Devil am I aboutWriting my own panegyric Stuffing myself with my own praise GlibGlibI can swallow it as easily as blancmanger and digest it faster than a ploughman does hastypudding Now would I in a fit of most AntiMussulman rage destroy the paper that bears such marks of my weakness but that I am rejoiced to procure fresh evidence against myself  BUT hark you Sir what is the reason that I have never received a syllable from you for upwards of three weeks If you imagine you are to treat me thus with impunity I must be so free as to inform you you are mistaken Therefore on Tuesday next the th  of the present month I order and command you after mending your pen putting smallbeer to your ink traversing your room five minutes and fifteen seconds and scratching your head not less than half a score times to take a folio sheet of plain tenpenny writingpaper and without compliments which are only wasting of time and being moreover little better than lies stuff me three sides of the said sheet of plain tenpenny writingpaper as full as it can hold of the first materials your prolific brain shall offerI'll have no picking and chusingNo battering of brows no wrinkles in the forehead when you once begin Strait forwardHelter skelterShandy for everThe more unstudied the more naturalIf I should discover one erasure be it ever so trivial with knife or pen dread the consequenceI'll pester you with nonsense  worse than a mad poetess does her husband  I HAVE left the old pedants of Oxford to correct their pride and their pupils at their leisure yet am I much mistaken if either undergo any considerable reform in a hurryI wonder what could possess my foolish brain with the supposition of finding genius and learning combined in this place I might as well have searched for chastity in a brothel or reason in a Methodist sermonBut this was among my whimsI will go and live in the seat of the Muses said I on the banks of the Isis more famous than the mount of Parnassus or the waters of HeliconWhat a boobyI will spend my substance among the sons of philosophy I shall be delighted and informed they are enlightened and dispassionate  open to conviction and in love with truthWhat a numskullI shall find among these sons of genius some one who wants a patron and a friend to bring his merits forward and shew them to the world I shall be happy to produce the fruits of ingenuity in the mart of scienceIt will atone in some degree for my own want of talents or misapplication of themWhat a dunderpate  I SHOULD be sorry rashly to affirm that there are no such persons as I was in search of amongst these learned and reverend wranglers but this I will affirm that instead of finding the teachers devoted to the discovery of truth I found them dogmatical to disgust and resolved to maintain what they have once advanced or believed though refuted to silenceThese were the fellows  who encouraged every author that opposed our divine Newtonnot because they believed him wrong but because he was educated at Cambridge As for their pupils instead of being in love with study vigilant and ingenious they are lost in riot and debauchery  BUT I have left them and am now at Swanley where dear George I expect shortly to see you who are a valuable compensation by the friendship I contracted with you at Oxford for the disappointment my sanguine temper led me into  PRAY what is become of your favourite comedian in whose praise your last was so eloquentWhat you are deceivedCome confessYou are ashamed of a too hasty prepossessionAye ayeI have  suffered that kind of chagrin fifty times in my lifeA fellow with a good address a placid countenance and a certain knack at saying no and yes could get into my good graces presently I would idolize him become his trumpeter or as a certain noble author has it  his puff  swear to all my acquaintance he was a miracle of virtue recommend him and assist him in his pursuits presently Sir when my gentleman imagines he has neither much to hope or fear from me he becomes proud despises my friendship ridicules the peculiarities which his narrow mind is capable of observing and as far as he is able makes me the jest of those who are as shallow as himselfBut I have done with them I have an oathan oath in heaven I'll be no more the dupe of fools and knaves  I MUST be exercising my pity upon some distressed devil or anotherI have taken a fresh freakI know you'll laugh but I don't careI have turned my house into an hospitalFor what say you The lame or the lazyI'll tell you SirI have at this instantnine doghorses seven of them blind forty young puppies almost as many kittens a tolerable flock of rotten sheep which the rascally owners made me pay as much for when they found my humour as if they had been sound ones an infinite number of young birds which I was obliged to purchase or see them devoted to destruction besides one and twenty old cows that are past calving  YOU have doubtless heard of the humanity of the good Indians of Bombay who have erected and endowed an hospital  for reptiles and insects and give any man a gratuity who will consent to be bound down and suffer these insects to feed upon him for the space of a night What a blest institutionWith what pleasure would I devote my blood to their service in my turn were I there Indians are rational beings whereas in this Christian country as it is called I am laughed at for undertaking something of a similar nature though upon a much more confined plan They have raised a report that I am insane and my name is become a by word to frighten children withBut no matterIf a man were to be laughed out of virtue I know not what would become of even those which they have dignified by the name of cardinal  I HAVE had this scheme in agitation for some time but I would not tell you  because I knew you would immediately have set your wits to work to put me out of conceit with it and my temper is so open to conviction that I dare not defend a good cause against such an antagonistI see but one side of a question at one time and it is always that which is represented at the instant to my imagination  MY family increases daily The sick the lame and the blind are brought to me from all quarters and I have the satisfaction to hear the poor people bless me when I have made a new purchase of themSince I have wrote this last paragraph and while I was at breakfast I have had three litters of blind puppies and an old boarstag that's past service added to my stockThe venders have all gone away satisfied and praying  heaven to prosper meOne wicked young dog indeed who has brought me a brokenlegged cat tittered while I was paying him and burst into a laugh as soon as his foot was over the threshold but how can I expect a boy to make just reflections when so few men are capable of themI fancy myself sometimes the patriarch Noah surrounded with my beasts in the ark and the whim pleases me so much that I have employed the barber of the village to weave me a white beard that shall reach down to the waistband of my breeches and give me the true antediluvian lockI don't intend to use this in concert it shall be a solo instrument for my own private amusement or to indulge a very particular friend  I AM still in some pain about your playerYou had fired my fancy and I began to have hopes there was really  some foundation for your praiseIf you have had no occasion to alter your opinion write directlysend me a letter expressI would rather hear this news than that of ten battles all fought by another Bajazet or any other grand Turk  Vale  H HANDFORD  LETTER XL Mr STAMFORD Sen to Mr SELDON  Dear SIR  MY Maria is much better but Tom Maitland has been very ill ever since the fire it is not thought he will live This dreadful accident occasioned by his giddiness is a great oppression to his spirits and he discovers much contrition for his past follies As he believes his end to be approaching he laments in the most pathetic manner the waste he has made of the best part of his time I sincerely wish he may recover and make my girl happy This stroke has opened his eyes The calmness with which he expects the close of life the strong flow of good sense that appears in his conversation and  the sensibility he expresses for his afflicted father convince me that I was mistaken in attributing his faults to a depravity of mind instead of a levity of disposition  MR MAITLAND who was perfectly superior to the loss of his fortune is unable to withstand this second calamity Yesterday morning we were sitting together by Tom's bedside his languid eyes were fixed on his father whose countenance expressed the struggle between his grief and the firmness of his mind His son grasped his hand and looked at him with a tenderness that seemed to intreat him not to grieve but which naturally produced the contrary effect  I understand you Tom said he I will compose myselfI will endeavour to bear my afflictions and submit to the decrees of heaven with  fortitudebut I must feel that I am a father  So saying he rose and went out being no longer able to conceal his emotions The dying youth followed him with his eyes and then turning to me with a deep sigh  Oh Mr Stamford  said he  'tis I that have done thisI have oppressed my father's age with want and sorrow Oh that my death would restore his peace with what pleasure should I welcome the gloomy power Your friendship may do much go dear Sir follow him and prevent his wasting the hours in useless grief 'Tis a satisfaction to me when I think your friendship will assist him to bear his afflictions  I LEFT him and went in search of Mr Maitland whom I found sitting with his head reclined in a musing posture  His mind was so intent on his misfortunes that he did not at first perceive my approach  "AT length" said he looking up  I have conquered and can submit to join in the general order of the system without reluctance Whatever the allwise Regent of the universe permits to be is best His attributes which we discover by a process of reason as nearly approaching to demonstration as our faculties will admit immensity of power and goodness cannot admit of the existence of  real  evil It is from the errors of beings necessarily imperfect that the appearance of  partial  evil arises and that partial evil is doubtless constituted as the means of acquiring a greater and otherwise not attainable good The retrospect on past life adds experiment  to proof and in some future age I shall rejoice at what is now considered as the greatest calamity Then my son we shall look back with pleasure on our present separation But ah my child  said he his voice softening as he spoke  'Tis not with tranquillity I can bear thy loss O my friend my Stamford how vain is the reliance we place on the fortitude of our minds Can it be philosophy to bear the torture of the soul with indifference Are the tender affections faults which a wise man ought to endeavour to overcome Are they not rather the distinguishing characters of humanity which to erase is to become worse than inanimate I am convinced they are The arguments of the understanding are too weak to check the flow of the heart I feel their insufficiency O my boy how  are my hopes blasted I must grieve Never again shall I delight in the sportive vivacity of my dear child O thou great power  continued he raising his hands in an agony of passion  I am become a blank in the universe Misery is my lot Remove me from this hated scene Let me accompany my son or restore him to me  AFTER a little pause growing more calm "I thank you my dear friend" said ne addressing himself to me  you sympathise with me I am perplexed I am bewildered in doubts The object of my cares of my affections is snatched from me and I want fortitude to sustain the loss The scheme of providence which I vainly thought to have comprehended is fled and darkness hangs over the prospect Why are we taught to regard delicacy of sentiment and sensibility  of mind as marks heaven's of benevolence to man Are they not bestowed to render us more completely wretchedto make us capable of pain infinitely more intense than that which arises from external causes that we may envy the happier brute Yet such is my state At once deprived of my fortune my son and the chearing view of a benevolent first Power I find myself seated in the midst of a dreadful void Every support on which my soul reposed is removed far from me and I wish for annihilation to ease me from the burthen of existence  I WAS glad to observe that the activity of his mind had not forsaken him at this crisis and that he was able to reason so abstractedly on the subject I assumed the bright side of the question  and attempted to prove him wrong in relinquishing the idea of universal order The conversation having restored his tranquillity in a great degree we went to see Tom The physicians had prognosticated his death on this day instead of which to our great joy he was just awakened from a found sleep as we entered The effect was so considerable that we have some hopes of his recovery though the danger is far from being entirely removed  I CANNOT think of leaving my friend so long as the probability of his losing his son remains but shall come to town as soon as he is thought out of danger which I hope will be in a day or two  I am with perfect esteem Your friend and humble servant J STAMFORD  LETTER XLI Mr WESTWOOD to H HANDFORD  Esq  Dear SIR  I SHALL attempt no apology for the silence you charge me withIt is sufficient excuse to you to say I was lazy or stupid or both which you know are no uncommon accidents in life  YOUR player that I interested you so much about is goneDon't be alarmedHe has been guilty of no meanness committed no outrageHis character is sacred to virtueHis exit has been with greater eclat than his entrance But I have lost himI never conceived a greater partiality for any man I will  not even except yourselfWhat a world would this be were men all like him and youDon't be angryYou must must permit me to speak the truth  I TOLD you the women were all in love with him I'll now tell you the consequence the men were all jealous of himOne of them a mean rascal who yet bears the title of gentleman attempted I believe to assassinate him Be that as it will he hired two ruffians to assist him in taking that revenge which he had not the courage to attempt by himselfWith this innocent view did these three worthies waylay him and God knows what would have been the consequence had they had any common man to deal with for the assistants were fellows remarkable for their prowessBut our hero fairly vanquished them allI happened  to come up just as he was finishing his conquestI beheld him deal some half dozen blowsNever before did I see such firmness and agility nor so much lenity after the victory to such vile rascals  IT was this affair that occasioned his departure I supposeHe supped with us on Sunday evening when in spite of his endeavours to the contrary he appeared exceedingly dejectedHe told us it was probable he should never have that pleasure again and was so much affected while he said this that the tears gushed into his eyes and he was obliged to turn his head away I perceived the shame and confusion that these emotions excited in him and delicacy obliged me to desist from enquiring into the cause of his grief He seemed rather to wave any hints  that were thrown out to him to tell where he was going and I was loath to urge himMy mother who almost doated on his company could hardly be restrained from asking him questions which I perceived would have embarrassed himBut he promised at parting that if ever he were happy once more which he believed impossible he should take great pleasure in communicating it to us  SINCE he has been gone we have heard several particulars which only serve to increase our admirationTwo or three poor families have declared that he has given them assistance and among the rest the wife of one of the assassins confessed he gave her a guinea upon hearing she was distressed for her rentThe rascal her husband has fled the country  I HAVE never found you offended when I have happened to differ in opinion with you I shall therefore venture to dissent from your picture of that seminary where I had the good fortune first to become acquainted with youThat the outline is just I will readily grant but the shadings are too deep This is only momentary with you and while you recollect particular instancesNeither have we any cause to wonder that learned men are not always rational menThere is a degree of genius requisite to this which falls to the share of a few onlyThe memory may be capable of bearing a greater burthen than the imagination and this produces ploddersThe reverse of the proposition is equally true and from hence springs enthusiasmI beg pardonI lift the ferula when I ought to kiss the rodI assume the tone of a  a teacher when I ought to look up at the master  THE impracticability of your hospital at least the impositions you are liable to sustain are so evident that I shall not attempt to reason with you concerning it Time will prove the best logician in this case The motive does honour to your heart and if I did not see the inconveniencies attending your scheme should wish to assist you in the pursuit  I SHALL be at Oxford next term and you may be certain shall not fail to pay you a visit By that time your  ménagerîe  will either be demolished or considerably augmented I shall rejoice in the length of your beard the hint of which I presume you borrowed from some of your family appertaining  to the antient fraternity of goats I think I see your puppies gnawing your shoes and your kittens wantoning round you while the senior cats enjoy the privilege of reposing in the venerable shade of your beard Though perhaps that patriarchal implement may be the destined asylum for animals of another species  à la mode de Bombay  The golden age will certainly be renewed in your seminary provided you can but keep the peace among your subjects I suppose you have several times had your pockets filled with mice who had fled thither to escape the army of cats you have purchased The wornout horse will I hope be in the first rank of your favourites You may condescend to select a rozinante for your own use and even if it should have but three legs I would advise you not to fear Euclid for your encouragement  has wrote a theorem to prove that threelegged stools stand firmest and if so why not horses which are much nobler animals I could say a great deal more concerning your project but do not wish to insult your judgment by instances so obvious  I am Your respectful friend and very humble servant G WESTWOOD  LETTER XLII H HANDFORD  Esq  to Mr WESTWOOD  Friend GEORGE  I REJOICE that your player has not deceived you but I am sorry that it is out of my power to become acquainted with himHad he continued at Kendal I would have posted away directly I am vexed Why should the fellow run away from me in this mannerAnd yet perhaps it is as well as it isWant of faith and gratitude are so recent in my memoryTherethere nowYou see what a damned vile dog I amCondemning a man whom I have never known any ill of but heard a great deal of good because I have met with rascals in my  lifeI am always finding myself but at these tricks  I WISH I had seen himPerhaps he was poor and too proud to own it And he relieved some families in distressI wish I had known himI dare say they did not come to tell their wants to himNo no How should they suppose a poor player had any thing to spareI have known those rascals myself those players I mean for all they have been guilty of some little paltry tricks do some very good actionsAnd I have been told that they are always willing to assist any of their fraternity who are travelling or out of employ although they are as poor as a country curate's horse themselves I love the dogs for thatI dare say this fellow that you tell me of had a thousand good qualities that you had  not time to discoverAnd so he had genius too you sayDamn him what did he run away in such a hurry for I would have come over to have seen him instantlyI would ride a thousand miles to be acquainted with the villainIts curst hard that I should be in continual pursuit of these rascals who are an honour to us and that they should always steal away from me in such a mannerBut that is the case with them they are all ashamed of doing good and like young sinners blush at what they loveThey are afraid of being detected and laughed atWell they mayIts a damned vile world that's the truth on't  I AM pestered plagued teized tormented to deathI believe all the cats in christendom are assembled in Oxfordshire I am obliged to hire a clerk  to pay the people and the village where I live is become a constant fairA fellow has set up the sign of the three Blind Kittens and has the impudence to tell my neighbours if my whims and my money will only hold out for one twelvemonth he shan't care a fig for the kingI thought to prevent this inundation by buying up all the old cats and secluding them in convents and monasteries of my own but the value of the breeders is increased to such a degree that I do not believe my whole fortune is capable of the purchaseBesides I am made an ass of A rascal who is a known sharper in these parts hearing of the aversion I had to cruelty bought an old oneeyed horse that was going to the dogs for five shillings Then taking a hammer in his hand watched an opportunity of finding me alone and addressed me  in the following manner  Look you master I know that you don't love to see any dumb creter abused and so if you don't give me ten pounds directly why I shall scoop out this old rip's odd eye with the sharp end of this here hammer now before your face  Aye and the damned villain would have done it too if I had not instantly complied but what was worse the abominable scoundrel had the audacity to tell me when I wanted him to deliver the horse first for fear he should extort a farther sum from me that he had more honour than to break his word  I PERCEIVE it is in vain for me to attempt the carrying on this scheme much longerMy poor invalids must be abandonedI suppose when they are turned upon this most merciful world  again the boys will make huntingmatches with the cats tie tincans and old kettles to their tails and clothe their feet in walnutshells my poor puppies will be fleaed for their skins and my old cattle driven to the next kennel of houndsNo no they shan't be so abused neitherIt would have been better for many of them had I never interposed in their behalf than suffer them to be thus tormentedThe cruel rascals would take a delight in inventing punishments if it were only to torture me  A WHELP of a boy yesterday had caught a young urchin and perceiving me threw it in water to make it extend its legs then with the rough side of a knotty stick sawed upon its ham till the creature cried like a child and when I ordered him to desist told me he would  not till I had given him sixpence Another overwise fellow a farmer of the parish swears he will lay an indictment next quartersessions against me for an encourager and breeder of  varmint  and a pettifogging son of a whore's rascal of an attorney told me to my face that if he could find out my heir he would persuade him to sue for his inheritance under the statute of lunacy  THERE is something worse than all this The avaricious rascals when they can find nothing that they think will excite my pity disable the first animal which is not dignified with the title of Christian and then bring it to me as an object worthy of my commiseration so that in fact instead of protecting I destroy The women have entertained a notion that I hate twolegged animals and one of them called after me the  other day to tell me I was an old rogue and that I had better give my money to the poor and maintain my own bastards than keep a parcel of dogs and cats that eat up the villageAdieu I have wearied youand I am certain I have wearied myself  H HANDFORD  LETTER XLIII H HANDFORD  Esq  to Mr WESTWOOD  Friend GEORGE  I HAVE rare news for youI am impatient till I have related it but am resolved to begin my story and tell it methodically  YOU are not unacquainted with my passion for traversing the fields and lying about in summertime upon green banks under trees or by the side of riversThese are my poetical moods and I delight in indulging them About a fortnight ago in the midst of one of them I was disturbed by the rustling of the leaves and the sudden appearance of a youth that leaped with the utmost ease and agility over a devilish  high hedge and whisked by me without noticing me with the fleetness of a stag that has just broke coverI was amazed at the symmetry of the fellow's person as well as his swiftness and my imagination having been warmed by Monsieur Homer's description of the race in which Clytonius was victor my fancy ran as fast as his legsThe spirit of curiosity was raised and I made twenty fruitless enquiries concerning this apparition  A DAY or two after it appeared again but in a quite different mannerThe mercurial spirit was evaporated instead of l'Allegro he was quite il Penseroso His arms were folded his eyes fixed and his cheeks bedewed with tearsI would give you a description of his person but that it is needlessI only say I never saw one that pleased me so much before  I can't tell what ailed me but his slow and steady walk his sighs which were deep and frequent the melancholy to apparent in his visage and the large tears that dropped unobserved as it were down his face gave me sensations of the most forcible kindI wanted to discourse with him in hopes I might have it in my power to alleviate his grief and for that purpose walked by the side of him for the whole length of a meadow without his taking the least notice of meJust before he came to the gate he stopped suddenly for a moment lifted up his eyes to heaven uttered a dismal groan and after calling out aloud Oh love love started from where he stood gave a bound over the gate and vanished again like lightning  I WISH I could tell you George how I behavedFor some time I remained  stupified entranced rivetted to the spot As soon as I could get loose I whistled I danced I cursed I prayed and at last fairly cried for vexation I never saw so fine a fellowHis grief too was so noble so manlyIt was fixed rooted  WELL Sir in this condition was I obliged to return home chagrined enough you may be sure and heard nothing of him for several daysAbout a week afterwards as I was going my rounds I approached a place where a parcel of young villains were bathing Before I was got up to them the whole pack set up a yelping to tell me one of the puppies their playfellows was drowning I hobbled up to the rascals as fast as I could and though I can swim no more than the leaden goose in my Lord Visto's garden soused in without  dread of danger or saying one short prayerThe lying dogs to be sure had told me that they did not believe it was out of my depthI soon found to the contrary though and discovered moreover like Falstaff that I had an admirable alacrity at sinkingYes yes SirI was at the bottom in a twinkling and there I might have lain in sure and certain hope of being dragged out by a boat hook when I had taken in sufficient water for the voyage had not thisaye this Alwynthe individual identical playeryour Alwyn my Alwyn The melancholy youth the runner but you shall hear more anonHe leapt inSir he stood as little upon ceremony as I had doneBut then he is a different fellowa very different fellowA man and a boy drowned said he God forbid Sir he brought us  up he landed us with a finger and a thumb  WHAT do you suppose I said when after some half hour's rubbing and tumbling for I was old and presently goneWhat I say do you think I said when I first opened my eyes and saw this Alwyn with a look like an angel over a condemned soul standing by me and heard him ask in the most expressive and softest tone possible how I did I'll tell you what I said SirI said nothingBut I would be content to be drowned every day of my life to feel what I felt  HOW the devil shall I contrive to tell you the rest of this story to make you caper and sing and wipe your eyes and rub your shins as a Christian ought  to doTake notice however that though I tell you  now  it was your Alwyn the player the fellow that I would have rid so far to see I knew nothing of that  then  No noI only looked upon him at that instant as a kind of heavenly being a sort of angel of benevolence and my delivererI did not half know himWell Sir he told me that his mother lived hard by and begged of me to suffer myself to be put to bed in her house and take a little cordial which she would give meAnd I told him that though I did not believe I should go to bed I would go with his help that is and take some of his mother's cordial with all my heart  DEAR George forgive my weakness I can scarcely proceedI can trifle no longerIs it any wonder that I am  affected when I tell you that the moment I put my foot over the threshold I beheld in Mrs Alwyn the person of a dear and longlost sister  MY joy and surprize at finding the nearest and my parents excepted the dearest relation I ever knew a sister whom in my youth I had loved with an unbounded affection to see her the happy mother of such a son one too who but the moment before had preserved my life the effect this had upon me is past my power to describe  YES my dear friend heaven has sent me a sister and a nephew to whom riches will be estimable because they will contribute to their happiness Not  from the value they put upon wealth they both have minds superior to such influence but from other circumstances The cause of my poor Alwyn's melancholy is loveThe youth from too great a consciousness of inferiority in point of wealth has not ventured to declare his passion except to the brother of the ladyMaria is the daughter of his father's friend Mr Stamford a capital merchantHe tells me he is in disgrace with the family and by what I can collect has had some foul play Not from themTheir character is greatly beyond it but my boy's health the exercise of his reason depends upon this affair being cleared up and there is no time so be lost  OH George what pleasure do I experience when I pronounce the words  my boy  I who yesterday had no friend  no relation whom I could suppose a part of myself to find an Alwyn and to find him mine the idea is too luxuriousHis account of Maria too is so romantic and so pleasing that I burn with impatience to see them united God forbid that any cross accident should intervene and prevent their unionI hope notAnd yet the terrors of the youth are communicated in part to meBut I will hope the best  YOU long to know how I and my sister came to suppose each other dead I will tell you  BY my approbation and advice she married a young officer a most amiable man and one of my intimate friends Alwyn her husband and myself were both young and both adventurers He laid out the greatest  part of his own and my sister's fortune the aggregate of which was no porter's burthen in purchasing from an ensign to a captain I crossed the Equinoctial and in a few years without I flatter myself deserving the appellation of Nabob as the word is at present applied became almost as rich as one My sister went abroad with her husband who was obliged to attend his regimentThat we might be certain not to lose the knowledge of each other's residence we determined to correspond by favour of a third person who was a cousin and the only relation we had Our caution proved our want of prescience more ways than oneThis cousin was a villainHe heard I was likely to grow rich and instead of forwarding my sister's letters wrote me an account of her and her husband's death and of mine to her I read in  the public papers of my poor friend Alwyn's fall in the field of battle and had therefore the less reason to doubt the truth of the whole storyWhen we respectively arrived in England he found means to continue the deception and was snatched off suddenly in the midst of his wicked career by an apoplectic fitShe has lived in this retreat for some years I have only bought the estate at which I now live lately and have not resided here till within this month 'Tis true my name is become pretty familiar among the villages hereabout from circumstances which I have before related but she lives so retired and has been under so much concern for her poor Alwyn that her not having heard of me is no miracle  MY boy's case will admit of no delay we must therefore be up in London in a few days This I am afraid will deprive us of the pleasure of seeing you when you come next into Oxfordshire I need not tell you how heartily you are beloved by your Kendal comedian your poor player He will tell it you himself by this same postYou know the aversion I bear to large professions but believe me when I say no man esteems you well wellloves you better than  H HANDFORD  MY sister will thank you for herself She adores you for the part you took in the cause of her hero her young Romeo her dear Harry  LETTER XLIV Mr STAMFORD Sen to Mr MAITLAND Senior  My dear Friend  MarkLane  WE arrived here safe and hope for the pleasure of your company as soon as your son is in a condition to bear the journey Our mutual friend Seldon desires his respects and expresses a great inclination to serve you but I told him I had a prior claim 'Tis the highest satisfaction to me that I have it in my power not for the selfish view of counterbalancing the obligation I owe you but sincerely out of regard for those virtues that first attached me to you I assure you my dear Maitland I shall think it pride and not philosophy if you continue to refuse my offers  'Tis true a philosopher can subsist on a little Exclude artificial wants and a small income will be sufficient But there are two prerogatives the rich enjoy which I am confident you would miss exceedingly The power of doing good and the company of people of enlarged understandings The first you will readily allow to be concomitant with riches and though genius and intelligence are not confined to station it is no wonder that we find they flourish most in the soil best adapted to their improvement Want of leisure and want of instruction prevent many a bright mind from unfolding its powers  BUT arguments apart I beg you will recollect with how little ceremony I requested your assistance on a former occasion when my future welfare entirely depended on it I did your  friendship justice I believed you sincere I even expected you would rejoice in the opportunity of serving me Nor was I deceived I did you a favour in permitting you to exert yourself for my advantage and I intreat nay I insist that you will let me enjoy the same satisfaction in my turn I shall think you doubt my friendship if you refuse me the privilege of rebuilding Maitlandhall and of adding my little estate to your farm in Essex to which it is contiguous I should be ashamed to urge as an argument that I can spare it because that would be the least consideration in the affair but however it is so and if that will be any inducement to your acceptance I beg you will not demur on that account  WHILE I am writing a letter is arrived from a Mr Hilkirk who is the  son of our friend Seldon He has adopted a strange mode of education for him which in my opinion is rather dangerous To enhance the value and enjoyment of prosperity and to give at the same time fortitude of mind and a knowledge of the world he turned him adrift some years ago and the event has answered his expectations thanks to the natural disposition of the youth more than to the prudence of the scheme itself  BUT more of this when we meet At present I am to acquaint you the purport of his letter is that in consequence of an advertisement inserted in the papers he has apprehended your late servant Stokes at TauntonDean in Somersetshire who offered an inland bill of exchange to discount to a friend of his He has  sent him under a guard and we expect him in on Saturday As for Hilkirk himself he says he has reasons to avoid coming to town which I suppose are the mortifications he has experienced here but his father writes by this post to command his attendance  I AM in hopes that we shall obtain intelligence which will tend to recover your loss in a great measure and shall write again on the subject if your arrival in town should not render it unnecessary I am dear Sir  Your sincere friend and humble servant J STAMFORD  LETTER XLV Mr WESTWOOD to H HANDFORD  Esq  Dear SIR  IT is impossible to describe the effect your last letter had in our family I never beheld my mother so affected before You cannot imagine how much Mr Alwyn is beloved by us all For my part I was almost ashamed of my weakness and was obliged to retire to give a decent vent to my passions  MY father and mother as well as your humble servant have all wrote to congratulate Mr AlwynMy father is particularly glad to find himself so good  a prophetWhen Mr Alwyn left Kendal he gave it as his opinion that my young friend was a gentleman of a most amiable character in disguise and that from the civilities which had passed between our family and him we should hear of him again to which he added that he suspected he was crossed in love We have done nothing but talk of you We have imagined fifty ways in which the groupe was disposed at the meeting of you and your sisterMy mother is certain you both fainted away and wishes she had been present to administer sal volatile My father who has been made acquainted with your character gives it as his opinion that poor Mrs Alwyn most assuredly gave a loud shriek and instantly fell into hysterics while you whistled and capered and that Mr Alwyn assumed exactly the same attitude that he saw Him in at  the appearance of the Ghost when he played HamletIn short you hardly felt your own situation more forcibly than we have done after youBut we are all eager to see you and are exceedingly anxious concerning Mr Alwyn's loveaffairWe have formed very romantic ideas of the young ladyIf she equals her lover they will be the most extraordinary pair in the universeI am called awayI'll come back and finish my letter before the post goes out  I AM returned in amazement at the villainy of man and the concern Mr Alwyn has in the discovery I have just made A person of the name of Stentor belonging to the players sent for me in a violent hurry The breath has just departed his body It was to do Mr Alwyn justice in his last moments A violent fever dried up the small remainder  of his blood so fast that I did but just arrive in time to receive a paper which he was exceedingly desirous of delivering to me with his own hands before he diedRead the contents and learn how much you are all interested in them  To GEORGE WESTWOOD  Esq  SIR  IF you are acquainted with the place of Mr Alwyn's retreat I conjure you to inform him or the following particulars  MR Stamford and Mr Alwyn are abused and I am the wicked instrument I have forged a letter imitating Mr Alwyn's writing at the instigation of Mrs Vincent to serve an amorous purpose for her and a mercenary envious one for myselfI pilfered his pocketbook to procure intelligenceGod forgive meI have acted basely vilely towards a good young man and my conscience torments meMrs Vincent wrote the anonymous letter to Mr  StamfordShe is a bad womanBut she had more excuseShe was in love God have mercy upon my poor soul I hope Mr Alwyn will forgive meI never knew so good a young man I was privy to a hundred of his generous benevolent actions yet was a rascal to himI am justly punished in being obliged to own in my dying moments God be merciful to me that I am a rascal Perhaps I had been a better man if I had had better fortuneGod only knows I hope he will have pity on my poor soulI am terrifiedIt is a sad thing to be punished everlastinglyChrist forgive meJesus have mercy upon meOh beg of Mr Alwyn to forgive me  T STENTOR  I RECEIVED the above from him in his last agonies His countenance was  alternately most pitiably expressive of hope and horrorI have not time to make commentsThe everlasting peace of my friends depends perhaps upon a single moment I therefore send it express and with orders to follow you to London if you are set our which is most probable  Heaven prosper you G WESTWOOD  LETTER XLVI Mr SELDON to Mr HILKIRK  My dear Son  I COULD no longer forbear to acquaint you with the reasons that have made us so long strangers to each other Your own conduct was indeed one but your behaviour in many instances since none of which are unknown to me has been so becoming and manly that I rejoice in the events that gave occasion for the exercising your fortitude and virtue I parted with you with the less regret as I foresaw the consequence yet my care and affection has not ceased to follow your steps Mr Turnbull has at intervals attended your progress and was witness  to the diligence and skill you exerted in apprehending the villain who had robbed Mr Maitland By his intelligence I find it time to place you in a situation that better becomes you than your present one You will have the satisfaction of enjoying as a consequence of your merit that affluence which had you known sooner might have proved the means of rendering you idle debauched and useless to society I mean no reproach when I speak this It has happened to men of less lively passions than yourself But as it is at present you are possessed of my best opinion I long to see you to explain every thing therefore do not fail to come immediately to town I write this post to Mr Turnbull who will call upon you and supply you with money and every thing you may be in need of  YOUR Julia whose coldness to you was the consequence of my positive commands is likewise impatient to see you If she is still dear to you you will hasten hither and I shall be happy to see you united to her by the most sacred ties  DO not suffer this unexpected intelligence to deprive you of that fortitude you have acquired Bear the same firm mind you have hitherto proved yourself master of and believe me to be notwithstanding the necessary severity of my conduct  Your most tender and affectionate father R SELDON  LETTER XLVII H HANDFORD  Esq  to Mr WESTWOOD  HERE we are GeorgeHere we areMy dear sister and I and my dear Alwyn andbut no matter for thatI hope to be the happiest rascal alivesometime within this fortnight that is  WE arrived in London Sir at five in the evening and alighted atpooh what the plague signifies where we alightedOur business was in Harleystreet where Mr Stamford has a house You can't imagine how I was teized Sir I could not get that good graceless dog Alwyn alongI was obliged to collar the fellow in the street when he found where I was going and should  not have moved him then had I not called in the assistance of half a dozen chairmenThe villain's proudplaguy proudand yet I love the dog for it  MR Stamford had accused him of ingratitude and guilt though he was not conscious of the charge yet he was too well acquainted with Mr Stamford's character not to be assured that he proceeded upon conviction  Why then my dear Alwyn says I it is your duty sirrah to go and vindicate your innocence  Innocence replied my delicate gentleman may be too assuming dear uncleTo avoid Mr Stamford while depressed with poverty as well as grief and to run precipitately  into his presence because I have found a protecting uncle  SIR he was going on with his fine reasons and I was obliged to stop his mouth▪I found I should be convinced and as I told him I thought it damned illnatured of him to convince a man in spite of his teeth when he would rather remain in ignoranceI had decoyed the dear rogue to that end of the town on pretence of seeing the new buildings The dog suspected me though and gave me several hints which I could not find in my heart to understandI should have told you though for I suppose you don't know it that the fellow has saved more lives than mineHe rescued his mistress from the flames  WELL Sir while we were wrangling who should come by but the footman of young Stamford a servant that is lately come to the family and knew nothing more of Alwyn than that he had seen him on the night of the fire preserve his young ladyThis fellow this servant no sooner beheld my boy than after staring for a moment with joy and astonishment he sprang towards him seized his hand and with a convulsive kind of transport pronounced God bless youGod almighty bless your honourI am glad I have found you You are the gentleman that saved my dear ladyI am sure on'tI shall never forget youDon't go Pray don't go Sir till I have called my old master and my young master and my my ladyThey'll never forgive me if I let you go  THE fellow did not wait for an answer but with three strides reached the door gave a thundering clatter upon the knocker bounced into the drawingroom seized young Stamford's hand and pulling him along kept exclaiming "Here he is Sir here he isI have found him I have found him I have found him"  WHOWhat's the matter who have you found  THE strangerThe angel that saved my young lady that carried her through the flaming fire    "GRACIOUS God exclaimed young Stamfordwas it you Mr Alwyn that saved the life of my sisterIs it possibleIt is it isI hope it isI believe it is I am sure it is"  WE got them into the house and then it was that the pathos of the scene was exhibitedMaria happened to be in her own chamber she heard the voice of Alwyn she flew she found her hope confirmed she sunk into the arms of her lover  "HOW have we been deceived" said Mr Stamford senior  Did you save my child AlwynWas it you my boy  continued the old gentleman while the tears trickled down his face  Are you the strangerIt is not possible you could write such letters  "WHAT letters" said Alwyn  NAY think no more of them answered heWe will forget them They were not your'sThey could not be your's  I DON'T know what you mean upon my honour replied the youth I never wrote any letters to you that    NO no they were not to meBut let us forget themIf I did not know your handAnd yetIt is impossible Why should you risque your life for one whom you despisedI have been deceivedThey could not be your'sYour are too amiableIt is to you that I am indebted for my life for every comfort But for you Maria had perished  WHILE they were in the midst of this ambiguous discourse which was entirely incomprehensible to Alwyn your letter most fortunately arrivedMy sister when she found it came express sent my man with it immediatelyI opened  and read aloud the last dying speech and confession of the expert Mr StentorShall I describe the effect or shall I leave you to imagine itYou can't Nor can I describe itLanguage is unequal to the taskI can add nothing but that we are happy and I hope you are so  H HANDFORD  LETTER XLVIII Mr STAMFORD to Mr MAITLAND  My dear Friend  I RECEIVED your favour by which I have the pleasure to observe that your son's health is much improved The natural consequence is that I expect your company in a few days Perhaps this letter may be too late to find you in Warwickshire but the news I have to communicate is too important to suffer any delay in sending it to you In short your strong box is found and is now in my custody You will receive inclosed an inventory of its contents which I hope on comparison with your accounts will not appear considerably  deficient The manner of its recovery was as follows  I INFORMED you in my last that Mr Hilkirk or more properly Mr Seldon junior had apprehended your late servant Stokes He arrived here yesterday under the conduct of a Mr Turnbull Mr Hilkirk being prevented from coming up on account of his situation as manager of the company of players which he cannot quit on the instant without doing irreparable damage to the concern  BY Stokes's direction a party of Sir John Fielding's men were dispatched to a house in Duke'sPlace where after a strict search your box was found It appears by his confession that he was connected with a gang of those villains who use their utmost endeavours to gain  intelligence by the means of servants of the property in any house they are desirous of pillaging He was but too capable of affording them that information and as the number of your people prevented their attempting to break into Maitlandhall they contrived to set it on fire We all know the success of their attempt and it is to be hoped the reward will follow such methods being now set on foot as promise to bring the offenders within the reach of justice  THE whole story being long I shall defer it till your arrival and in the interim have another piece of business to communicate which gives me some pain though I am assured you know me too well to suppose me actuated by any motives but those of the strictest integrity and regard for you  I DARE say you are surprized at this preamble and I am convinced it is unnecessary therefore without more words you are to know that it is impossible for our children to be united as we once flattered ourselves I have discovered that my Maria's affections were fixed before she saw your son and am sincerely concerned that I was not sooner apprized of it There is reason to think your son is not violently bent on the match at least I hope so I make no apologies for my frankness and sincerity Your candour will not require them when you are acquainted with the affair On the contrary I rely on having the pleasure of your company and that of your son at my daughter's marriage  IT is now four years since I received into my countinghouse a young gentleman of the name of Alwyn the son of  that Alwyn whom you have so often heard me mention with affection and regret You may perhaps remember seeing him when you were in town about two years ago The trifling property his father left was barely sufficient to maintain his mother in a country retreat so that I had the pleasure of doing him a singular service by introducing him to the world My care was not lost on an ungrateful charge I had the satisfaction to see him daily improve in every accomplishment and to behold the virtues of my friend revive in the person of his son A native sincerity and openness of conduct added to the most mild and obliging disposition commanded the esteem of all who knew him and for my part I regarded him almost as my own child At the beginning of this summer he went into the country for the benefit of his health as he then  informed me but as I now find to avoid the presence of my daughter for whom he entertained a passion that did not as he rightly judged suit his circumstances Maria was at the same time equally prejudiced in his favour which makes his retreat more generous and disinterested While he was in the country I received a letter charging him with a degree of perfidy and baseness that I should never have credited had not the proof appeared of the most incontrovertible nature I wrote to him on the subject as I thought the crime deserved and his innocence would probably never have been vindicated but for a fortunate concurrence of circumstances that have cleared up the whole mystery  THE relation is too long to be inserted in this letter and must be deferred  till your arrival He has been vilely traduced He is incapable of the least meaness Come to us my dear Maitland I know you will love him 'Twas he that saved my daughter from the flames and delivered me from a life of sorrow She is due to his care He has merited her I know my dear friend will think so and rejoice with us I am quite elated We are all happy My Maria is hardly recovered from the surprize and joy this event has occasioned Charles is in raptures to find his Alwyn the amiable character he once thought him and Alwyn is in a state that can better be imagined than expressed  THE company of yourself and son will be an addition to our happiness with which we hope you will soon  favour us For that reason I conclude without ceremony by assuring you that I am  Your most affectionate friend STAMFORD  LETTER XLIX Mr ALWYN to Mr WESTWOOD  FORGIVE dear Sir my having till now delayed to write you an account of the completion of my felicity I have been so long accustomed to consider the present happy turn of my fate as a thing utterly impossible that I scarce can yet believe it real Thanks to my worthy patron my kind father thanks to my honoured uncle and my dear dear Maria I am at length convinced Last Friday was the distinguished day that gave the most amiable the loveliest of her sex to my arms I cannot describe the joy which reigns universally among us I am encircled by friends by relations I had almost said by angels  FORTUNE seems resolved no longer to let virtue and genius languish in obscurity This appears by an event which has increased our happiness My friend and former companion Mr Hilkirk came to town on Thursday You may remember when I was at Kendal I gave you the history of his adventures and how much you found yourself interested You thought the conduct of Mr Seldon quite aenigmatical but what will you say when you are informed that he is the only son of that gentleman that he is beloved with a most parental tenderness and that his father has contrived not only to give him a very peculiar kind of education but that he has also brought up Julia with an express intention of her becoming his wife that their love for each other was in some degree the effect of stratagem on the part of Mr Seldon  who had nothing so much at heart as the making them both happy and that he has assisted misfortune as it were in the persecution of his son still taking care to keep by various contrivances an eye over his actions and not permitting him to be entirely depressed Mr Seldon had suffered almost every kind of hardship in his youth but by the force of good sense and industry had with amazing fortitude surmounted every difficulty and is at present not only a very worthy but a very consequential member of society His son whose name is William Hilkirk Seldon was born before the old gentleman had emerged from obscurity and his mother dying was placed at a peasant's in the country and afterwards sent to a grammarschool But as the father had already resolved upon a plan of education he did not let even the people  with whom his son was know to whom he belonged  YOU have heard the residue of the story except that Mr Hilkirk has been the principal agent in discovering the villain who fired Maitlandhall and purloined the strong box Mr Seldon applauds himself exceedingly upon the success of his plan He beholds him with the combined advantages that education and an active life bestow He affirms that if by any mischance his son should become poor he will support the change with fortitude that the common accidents of life will not have power to deprive him of temper that his knowledge of mankind will not only make him discern the motives of their actions but likewise give him an ascendancy over themIndeed he adduces a thousand reasons which at least are exceedingly  specious and in some instances true but I dare say you think with me that had the experiment been made upon a weaker mind it would scarcely have succeeded so well  WHEN my friend Hilkirk for so I must still call him arrived in town his beloved Julia was with us at Mr Stamford's whither he immediately flew The interview was tender and affecting The young lady who had put the utmost restraint upon her inclinations in obedience to Mr Seldon who is her uncle was incapable of suppressing her emotions She was fearful lest her former treatment of Hilkirk whom she tenderly loved and which was the effect of her uncle's commands should be remembered by him and could not conceal her anxiety Hilkirk felt the delicacy of her passion without the  power of alleviating her fears except by repeated declarations of his love  THE same day that Mr Hilkirk arrived Mr Maitland the young gentleman who was designed for Maria and his father came to town Mr Maitland senior who is a most amiable man instead of being chagrined at his son's disappointment expressed the warmest sense of our felicity and I assure you was remarkably liberal of goodnatured reflections in favour of your humble servant The vivacity of the young gentleman too has been of singular service in giving the conversation which has been apt to take too sentimental a turn a degree of ease and brilliancy that have had a very pleasing effect and which has been much heightened by the benevolent disposition of the father as well as the friendship and  attachment he discovers for the Stamford family of which I am now become a part He assisted at the marriage ceremony with a degree of chearfulness and pleasure that proved the satisfaction he received Never before did I behold so happy a day My dear Maria with a profusion of charms a multitude of virtues made inevitably mine my friend receiving the reward of his constancy the hand of his Julia at the same time surrounded by my mother whose heart was replete with tenderness and joy by my uncle whose eyes and actions proved how much he was interested caressed by my dear friend the brother of my Maria and rewarded by her father it was an excess of transport that can only be imagined  I MUST forbear The ideas are too luxuriant too inexpressible Pray give  my most sincere respects to your worthy parents and tell them when they come to town during the approaching winter they will find a small society who hope frequently to enjoy the pleasure of their company of which honour no one is more desirous than  SIR  Your happy friend and humble servant HENRY HANDFORD ALWYN  FINIS
