 REMARKS AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE MORALITY and DIVINITY CONTAINED IN Dr  FREE  's CERTAIN ARTICLES proposed to the Court of Assistants of the Worshipful Company of  SALTERS  In a LETTER to the Reverend Dr  FREE  As FREE and not using your Liberty as a Cloak of Maliciousness  PET ii  LONDON Printed by M LEWIS in  PaternosterRow  And sold by E DILLY in the  Poultry  J FULLER in  Blowbladderstreet  near  Cheapside  J ROBINSON at  DockHead  and W LEPARD opposite  BattleBridge  in  TooleyStreet  Price Threepence  REMARKS  c  REVEREND SIR  _TRUE Christianity breaths no other Spirit than Peace and Love It is the peculiar Genius of the Gospel of Christ to furnish its Disciples not with  carnal  but  spiritual  Weapons Now to behave becoming the Spirit of Christianity and to wield the Weapons of our Warfare aright in opposing Error and in defending the Truths of our most holy Religion is commendable it is Praiseworthy this is to act the  Christian  this to display the  Divine  Now as you was pleased to make a public Attack upon me surely it behoved you thus to act For in what ever Light you are pleased to consider me either as a Person in an inferior Station of Life to yourself or as a private Christian though even held in the most contemptible View because deemed by you a  Methodist  yet surely Sir this will by no Means justify that Rudeness of  Insult  that Rant of  Defamation  that Venom of  Scurrility  with which you was pleased to treat me And this without the least Offence or Provocation For on my cooly asking you Why this Treatment of me have I ever behaved amiss to you You ingenuously confessed I had not and that  "you liked me very well as from Man to Man but that my Principles as a  Methodist  you were averse to  c  "  But Sir is it consistent with the Character of the  Christian  the Politeness of the  Gentleman  the Dignity of the  Clergyman  or the Eminence of the  Doctor in Divinity  to insult defame and abuse a Person upon a supposed or even real Disagreement in religious Principles and even when you had nothing to charge upon a Person's Behaviour  in social Life Surely such Behaviour is unjustifiable even to a  Jew  or a  Turk  But if my Principles did not please you yet why should my Complexion offend you Though Nature has not been so liberal with the Tinge of blooming Red to adorn my Cheeks or if Illness has caused Paleness there yet why the Reflection of  a Smockfaced Fellow  Who could have expected this from the Reverend Dr  Free  As to what you was pleased to tell me you should live to do after I am dead the Lord in whose Hands are the Issues of Life and Death only knows who may be summoned to Judgment first may he prepare you and me for it But if you should visit the silent Mansions of the Dead even to  kick the Dirt over my Grave  it will no more affect me when dead than your Treatment of me when living  But of this I forbear to add more as I can't but persuade myself that on the least serious and cool Reflection you must be conscious of having acted much out of Character and I assure you though the public Attack you was pleased to make on me was so very furious though I was really grieved at your extreme Warmth yet it by no Means excited me to Anger against you neither doth it dispose me to be very ready to use your own Words to  run a Tilt or to change a Word with you  in this public Way  But as you was then pleased to exhibit a general Charge against me and declined entring into Particulars referring me to a  Thing  you produced Part of which you then read and have since published entitled  Certain Articles  c Now this Pamphlet is intended to asperse those Persons you are pleased to call  Methodists  as a Set of People of very dangerous Principles pernicious in their Nature and destructive in their Consequences both to Church and State and therefore unfit Members of Society And as you publicly read part of these Articles in order to load  me  with the unjust Allegations therein contained and thereby to bring  me  under the Censure and Contempt of the Company then present Silence here I think criminal In order therefore to do Justice to my Principles as a Member of the  established Church of  England  I hope I shall be justified in this Reply Therefore I embrace this Opportunity of publicly declaring my Principles and of giving a  Reason of the Hope that is in me  and at the same Time of detecting and exposing the Errors you have advanced and shewing how contrary your Judgment is to the clear Determination of the Church of  England  and the express Declarations of holy Scripture  Whether you think it  decent  to reply or keep  profound Silence  it weighs nothing with me But you may be decent without being dumb write without Wrath reason without Scurrility and  condescend to Men of low Estate  without losing any Part of your Dignity or thinking them  beneath your Notice  But just as you please Doctor Reply or forbear I am content I approve your Example of Brevity You say  "all  wise  and  good  People would choose to manage a religious Dispute in this Manner"  But Sir suffer me to observe had your few Pages abounded with less of the Wrath of Men and more of the Mildness of the Christian and if Christian Moderation and Charity had been substituted in the Room of that Ferocity of Spirit and Uncharitableness of Censure Had you consulted this wholesome Advice  " Be calm in arguing for Fierceness makes  " Error a Fault and Truth Discourtesy  sure I am your Performance had met with less Censure and more Approbation and the Author would have had a juster Claim to the Epithets of  Wise  and  Good  But let us attend to this Treatise or these Directions to a Worshipful Court or this Libel against a Clergyman orwhat shall I call it Why Page the st begins the Preamble of  "Certain Articles propos'd to the serious Consideration of the  Court of Assistants  of the Worshipful Company of the  Salters  relative to the Application of a  Methodist  for their Votes and Interest in order to his being promoted to the  Tuesday  's Lectureship at  St Dunstans in the East  at present in the Possession of the Reverend Mr  Bn  he being still alive and by God's Favour likely to continue to live"  To be sure it begins pretty enough But then won't the worthy Gentlemen of of this Worshipful Court think you take too much upon you Is it not rather too  Free  thus publicly to direct or influence them in their Choice as though they would be remiss in enquiring into or were not capable to judge of the Merit of the Candidates themselves What can you say to this Sir Why you tell them that you are  "  a Person  concerned both for their  Honour  and the  public Good  "  Vastly kind indeed How useful are your publicspirited Gentlemen to Society For upon Supposition that these worthy Gentlemen of this Court are not duly concerned for  their own Honour  and the  public Good  then your Hints and Directions are well timed  For you observe Page  "  There are in all Places some Bystanders to observe whether such Duties be  rightly  performed or not  "  So Sir you as one of these  Bystanders  are just looking on and as you see Need are giving all just and necessary Hints and Directions to this Worshipful Court Well since this is the Case what distinguished Honours and what noble Emoluments are to be your Reward for all your disinterested Pains and Labour who is able to say  The Freedom of a Company in a Gold Box is no inconsiderable Present besides enjoying the much greater Honour of being  Free  of a Company than making  Free  with the Worshipful Court of Assistants orin Case of a Vacancy of this Lectureship suppose Dr  Free  as a Reward for his  Certain Articles  c was to be promoted to it Sir what say you to this would not this silence  the Accusations or Murmurings of the BYSTANDERS Free  the Gentlemen's  Characters both from the Censure as well as the Complaints of the PEOPLE  which you represent the Danger of Page You can have no Objection to this little Donation it is pretty evident you can't As it is well known you stand a Candidate and are making Interest for this Lectureship  Now Doctor here we have a  Key  to the Whole Hence 'tis obvious that all that Pretension of your being  concerned  for the  Gentlemens  Honour  and the  Publick Good  alas Sir it dwindles into little low mean and sordid Motives tending to sinister Ends and selfish Views For as Dr  Free  appears to be a Candidate he therefore looks on this avowed  Methodist  as he deems him as his Rival or Competitor standing in the Way of his Interest Now Sir since this is the true State of the Case in what Light think you will all that Defamation Obloquy and Reproach with which you have been pleased to treat this Reverend and worthy Clergyman appear  Sir the Discerning and Judicious will have an Eye to this They will candidly weigh this Affair They will take Knowledge of the Bitterness of your Spirit the extreme Virulence of your Language and the Unchristian Treatment of the Gentleman you thus write against and in the Determination of cool Reason and solid Judgment you will be censured as having exceeded all Bounds of Moderation Charity and Benevolence and all this in subservient Views to your own SelfInterest and in the End you will be found to have overshot the Mark and to have counteracted your own  crafty Arts and Schemes  Here then we see the Motives and Designs of these  certain Articles  The short View of the History of this doughty Performance stands thus    st  Here is a  Tuesday  Lectureship in the Gift of the Worshipful Company of  Salters  which Dr  Free  thinks worth his applying for therefore    dly  Offers himself as a Candidate and makes Interest for the same but    dly  On Application finds the Rev Mr has the Favour of some of the worthy Gentlemen of the Court of Assistants on which he tells them Mr is a  Methodist  But not thinking this sufficient to prejudice the Minds of these Gentlemen against Mr Therefore    thly  In an extreme ill Humour you set about drawing up certain Articles which you present to the Gentlemen in order to asperse blacken and vilify this opposing Candidate How far you have succeeded herein these few Sentences set forth you assert  "he acts in open and scandalous Opposition to the Church of  England  with Blasphemy and ImpietyDiabolical Phrenzygives our Saviour the Liean Enemy to all good Worksdecries Virtue and Moralityacting like a  Mahometan  or Infidel or the Devil himselfReleasing Men from their natural Fears of a DeityMaking Room for all Manner of Vice and VillainyNot only guilty of Atheism but Treason also against the State and Government  c c c  "  and after all this who would wonder to find that Hint as a Specimen of your Moderation and Charity for dispatching a Person so obnoxious in your Eyes as being not fit to live for you say  Atheists in some Countries have been put to Death as Persons very dangerous to a State  "  And    thly  All thro' these Articles you admonish the Gentlemen  "that they can't as Members of the Church of  England  be concerned in promoting such a Personnor as good Subjects to the State for Fear of the Magistrates Censure of their Characters""incurring the Censure of the Bishop"  and Page you suppose the Gentlemen to be governed by  private Interest  and influenced by avaritious Views in  Dealing  not very delicate not very genteel this I think Doctor you tell them  "if they fall under the Bishops Censure the best Excuse they can make"  too much supposed and too much implied indeed Sir is  that they had  UNWARILY  promised an Acquaintance with whom they had some  DEALINGS or PRIVATE INTEREST  that they would at All  ADVENTURES  be serviceable to such a Person  "  What all this to Gentlemen of common Prudence Doctor Then you shew the Gentlemen a pretty Knack of departing from a PRECIPITATE PROMISE what at them again Sir after having introduced a Quotation from a Letter of the late Bishop of  London  wish the Preservation of the Life of Mr  Bn  and the Disappointment of the Arts and Schemes of this crafty  Enthusiast  you take your Leave of the Gentlemen and soare their humble Servant And  Lastly  While this peccant Humour was operating and being  ready to run atilt  as you say I chanced to fall  n your Way and so you vented some of your Anger and Resentment upon  me  as a  Methodist  Here ends the History of Dr  Free  's certain Articles and Postcript Thus much for the  Morality  of them Next let us attend to the Divinity they contain  But I would premise that after all I am really at a Loss to know what you mean by a  Methodist  The Appellation is a very simple inoffensive one I see no more Harm in it than in being called a  Tradesman  a  Mechanick  or  Doctor in Divinity  though you are pleased to use it as a Term of Reproach in order to convey some very bad Idea of the Persons you are pleased to apply it to I told you my Profession that I am a Member of the established Church of  England  consequently that I attend upon her Worship approve her Doctrines and live in Communion with her I am of no other Sect or Party  Now am I a  Methodist  for this "No" What then  "Why you hear particular Men such as Mr  Romaine Jones  c"  I do I do hear and rejoice constantly to hear them and all such Ministers who faithfully and conscientiously preach the Doctrines of the Church of  England  Doth this constitute me a  Methodist  "Yes" Why then I'll be a  Methodist  one of your  Church of England Methodists  But are not these Gentlemen Ministers of our Church Are they not regularly ordained and do they not act regularly  "Yes but they are  Methodists  for all that" "How so" "Why they preach different Doctrines from the rest of the Clergy"  This may be Truth and yet no Fault in them for no sooner doth a Minister preach the antient Scripture Doctrines of our Church but he is deemd'd a  Methodist  I wish Doctor you had obliged the World with your Description of a  Methodist  but as you have not I will here lay before you and the World the best Description I am able  He is one whom GOD hath chosen in  Christ  out of Mankind to deliver from Curse and Damnation and to bring by  Christ  to everlasting Salvation he is called according to GOD's Purpose by his Spirit working in due Season he through Grace obeys the Calling he is justified  Freely  he is made the Son of GOD by Adoption he  Feels  in himself the Workings of the Spirit of  Christ  mortifying the Works of the Flesh and his earthly Members and drawing up his Mind to high and heavenly Things he is made like the Image of  Christ  walks religiously in  Good Works  and at length by GOD's Mercy not for Works of Righteousness he hath done but according to GOD's Mercy he is saved and attains to everlasting Felicity  Now Sir have you any Dislike to this View of  Methodism  I think you cannot As I greatly approve the Language of our Church I have borrow'd these Words from the th Article May the LORD GOD of Grace and Love make you and I such Kind of  Methodists  I pray To spread such Kind of  Methodism  as is here described and to bring Mankind into this happy this holy State is the chief End and Design of these truly Reverend and Worthy Clergymen of our Church who pass under this Denomination With many of them I have the Honour to be pretty conversant and as it is my great Happiness to hear the Doctrines which they publickly deliver I can and do venture to affirm that to promote and propagate true  Christianity  that Men might be  Christians  not in Name only but also in true Faith and holy Practice to be their View To this great and good End they labour and are indefatigable and for the Sake of this they go thro'  evil Report and good Report  for  Christ  's Sake and the Good of precious Souls they are content to be accounted  Madmen  and  Fools  they are  despised reviled defamed  yea they are treated  as the Filth of the World and the Offscouring of all Things  and under all this they think themselves happy in being instrumental of begetting in the Hearts of Sinners Repentance towards GOD and Faith in our Lord  Jesus  that from a Principle of Love to GOD  and Man they might be holy in all Manner of Conversation and Godliness and zealous of good Works here and that from being Members of  Christ  's Church militant on Earth they might be admitted to the Church triumphant in Glory  And in order to this the Doctrines they preach are such as are agreeable to GOD's holy Word and that plain tho'short System of Divinity laid down in the Articles of the Church of  England  But you object Page That  "it is notorious that the  Methodists  under the Mask of being  true Sons  of the Church do ever explain the Word  Faith  as it stands in some of St  Paul  's Writings in a Manner so different from the clear Declaration of St  James  as to make the Doctrine of one Apostle a direct and flat Contradiction to the other"  Sir I affirm this Charge from Beginning to End to be notoriously false One Circumstance is wanting there the Proof the Proof Doctor Where is that Proof to support these Assertions Which of the  Methodists  do this Why did you not name some one or more of them Why have you not produced some Quotation from some of their Writings as many of them have published what they preach to prove your Assertion The plain Reason is because you could not And  Therefore in the Judgment of Truth you would have been equally justifiable in saying that the  Methodists  put both the Apostles St  Paul  and St  James  to Death So far from making the Doctrine of one Apostle a flat Contradiction to the other the Doctrines they advance have a direct Tendency to reconcile and explain them For they allow and make Use of that just and well known Distinction approved of by all sound Protestant Divines that St  Paul  speaks of Justification before GOD St  James  of Justification before Men St  Paul  speaks of the Justification of our Persons through Faith in  Jesus  the Saviour of Sinners St  James  of the Justification of our Faith in the Sight of Men by its bringing forth good Works as the certain Evidence and Effects of its being a  lively  Faith Neither do they preach as  you would insinuate that Men are saved by  a dead Faith  contrary to the Doctrine of St  James  But not to do as you have assert without Evidence of the Many that might be brought to invalidate your Assertion I will produce a sew Sentences from my honoured and much esteemed Friends the Rev Mr  Romaine  and Mr  Jones  "Vicious Selflove raises a thousand Objections against free Justification thro'  Christ  's Righteousness But there has been one made by Men of corrupt Minds in every Age and which they are still making they object to the Scripture Doctrine that it makes void the Law and renders an holy Life needlessThe Righteousness of GOD is a new Creation And why are we created anew in  Christ Jesus  that we may live still to the Flesh and its corrupt Appetites No for then we should be created anew in the Devil and not in  Christ Jesus  but we are created anew unto good WorksGOD gives us Righteousness from Heaven that it may raise us up to HeavenIt will not remain in us as a dead and barren Principle but will make us fruitful in good Works even that we may be filled with the Fruits of Righteousness which are by  Jesus Christ  unto the Glory and Praise of God the Father"  Vide  Mr  Romaine  's Sermon lately preached before the University of  Oxford  on  The Lord our Righteousness  And Mr  Jones  on this very Subject namely reconciling St  Paul  and St  James  in his Exposition of the Church Catechism we have these Words  "When we preach up Justification by Faith we mean not a dead lifeless Faith the Faith of Devils but such a Faith as is  the Gift of God  witnessed to Souls by his Spirit and leading them into Holiness of Heart and Life"  And again  "By Faith is meant a certain Principle implanted in the Soul which will not fail to produce Piety and Holiness of Heart and Life"  And once more  "We are justified only by Faith in  Christ Jesus  This Faith however is a vital Principle of Holiness within us and they who really have it are never destitute of good Fruits Works are very far from being unnecessary because without them our Faith can never be tried"  Hence all that you have said on this Head amounts to no more than mere Rant and Declamation and all the Consequences which  you have attempted to draw do not at all affect the Persons against whom you design them for this very plain Reason because the Premises laid down are false and the farther you advance the more you lose Sight of the Truth Therefore I need say no more upon this Head Those who hear these Ministers preach know the Contrary of what you have charged upon them and those who do not unless utterly blinded by Prejudice may have fuller Satisfaction of the Unjustness of your Charge from the many Tracts Sermons  c  which have been published by these Reverend Ministers of your Church who are called  Methodists  Sir before I quit this Part permit me to remind you that the Evidence you should have given to this  worshipful Court  though even against  Methodists  ought to have been the  Truth  the  whole Truth  and  nothing but the Truth  I do not believe any one of the Reverend Body of the Clergy beside yourself how much soever they may disapprove of what is called  Methodism  would have wrote either against the worthy and pious Clergyman you in particular oppose or the Body of those Clergymen who are deemed  Methodists  in so unkind uncharitable and unchristian Spirit I am persuaded that a Regard to Truth Modesty and Decency would have influenced their Pens to more Mildness and Humanity And yet you talk very highly of  Virtue  and  Morality  and say it is a Rule in Religion to do as we would be done byHere that Question from St  James  is very pertinent  Shew me your Faith by your Works  Is not Gentleness Meekness Kindness brotherly Charity in your System of Morality but whose Image and Superscription doth your Performance bear This I leave to the Publick to determine I forbear and shall pass on to take a View of your Divinity here I must not forget your very extraordinary Note the Bottom of Page You say  "in the Epistle to the  Romans  and  Galatians  the Word Faith generally stands for the whole of the Christian Religion"  No more than your  Hand  can be said to be your  whole Body Faith  there stands for that Heavenborn Grace which is  the Gift of God  Ephes ii wrought in the Hearts of Sinners by the Holy Spirit and gives  Evidence Trust  and  Confidence  to the Soul of its Interest in and Justification by the Blood and Righteousness of  Jesus Christ  and is attended with the sweet and happy Sense  of  Peace  and  Love  Holiness of Heart and Obedience of Life May my Reverend and Learned Correspondent ever know the  Joy  and feel  the Peace of believing  even that Peace of God  which passeth all Understanding  and that Joy in the Holy Ghost which is  unspeakable and sull of Glory  In the next Observation here is a most egregious Blunder you say  "the Word  alone  excludes only the  Jewish  Ceremonies"  Now it happens a little unlucky for you Doctor the Word  alone  is not once used upon this Subject in neither of the Epistles to the  Romans  or  Galatians  How is this Sir But come  Humanum est errare  We'll go on next you say  "the Word  Works  means not Works of  Morality  but the ceremonial Part of  Jewish  Ceremonies"  This I absolutely deny and that upon the Authority of our Church and the Judgment of all found Protestant Divines See  Rom  iii  Do we then make void the Law thro' Faith God forbid yea we establish it  Now I ask you Doth St  Paul  mean to establish the moral Law or the  Jewish  Ceremonies What say you Sir Is not this one Text sufficient to overthrow your Assertion Now then what Door of Advantage has this Key opened to you And yet you call this a  "  Key to the Whole  "  What are we to understand that this  Key  opens the View of all that Error and Absurdity of your  whole  Performance  Page and you say  "we must contend that there is Comparative Merit Comparison being made between Man and Man Some Men are better than others and this Difference in the Behaviour of Men is Virtue and Vice It is blasphemous to say that GOD makes no Distinction between Virtue and Vice or that he does not love Virtue and hate Vice But if he love Virtue there must be something in Virtue naturally amiable and that is Merit not absolute Merit indeed but human Merit Merit in one Man above another otherwise the Wicked would have as good a Title to Salvation as the Good"  Should we not expect as a  Christian  Divine you would have used Scripture Language and scriptural Distinctions but this you have not done Be it known unto you that we Protestant  Church of  England Methodists  object to all Kind of  Merit of Man Merit of Works  all  human Merit  We have the Authority of Scripture we have the Determination of our Church to support us herein We have heard indeed of a Champion for the Church of  Rome  who says  good Works  are  Mercatura Regni Coelestis  the Price we pay for the Kingdom of Heaven And another Zealot of that Communion declares  Coelum Gratis non Accipiam  it shall never be said that I receive Heaven as a Matter of Alms And tho' you are pleased to appear as the Triumvirate and to contend for  comparative Merit  and  human Merit  and the  Merits of Virtue and Morality  and I know not what unscriptural Jargon yet we Protestants know of no  Merit  to give us a Title to the Kingdom of Heaven but the Merits of  Jesus Christ  alone Our Church teaches us not to presume to approach the Table of the Lord trusting in our own Righteousness nor to address the Throne of Grace but thro' the Merits and Righteousness of  Jesus  only for thus she concludes all her Prayers If  you  are  given to change  we are not We know the Voice of our Church We approve her Doctrines And we will abide by them let others do as they please We are for none of your arrant Popery none of the Heresies of that Church though under the Veil of Protestantism  We own and believe the Misery and Depravity of Man's State by the Fall  "that every Man is far gone from original Righteousness and is of his own Nature inclined to Evil and that therefore thro' original Sin every Person born into this World deserveth God's Wrath and Damnation"  as our Church teaches us in the ninth Article And we are taught likewise that it is by the free Grace and unmerited Love of God only that Sinners are deliver'd from such a lost and helpless State as declared in the tenth Article  "for the Condition os Man after the Fall is such that so far from meriting any Thing at the Hands of God he is unable to turn and prepare himself by his own natural Strength and good Works to Faith and calling upon God without the Grace of God by  Christ  c"  And so far are we from trusting to relying upon or boasting of our own Works or comparative or human Merit to procure us a Title to the Kingdom of Heaven which you talk of that we firmly hold and believe with our eleventh Article that  "we are accounted righteous before God  ONLY for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour  Jesus Christ  by Faith not for our own Works or Deservings"  as you tell us but we are justified by Faith  only  and our Church farther calls this  "a  most wholesome  Doctrine and very full of  Godly  Comfort"  tho' you are pleased to deny and explode this We believe and are firmly persuaded by the Word of God as well as the Declaration of our Church Article That  "good Works are the Fruits of Faith and follow after not go before in order to procure our Justification or Title to Glory they follow after our Justification yet they cannot put away our Sins nor endure the Severity of God's Wrath"  how then can you in any Sense say they give us a Title to Glory for observe our Church here speaks of the Works of the Saints real  Christians  true Believers such Works as spring from Faith done from a right Principle and to a right End and yet these Works our Article declares  "can't put away our Sins nor endure the Severity of God's Wrath yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God"  How thro' their own natural Amiableness as you say No Acceptable to God in  Christ  thro' whom our Persons are justified pardoned and accepted and thro' whose Merits alone we obtain a Title to eternal Glory and our Works are also accepted  in him  as  "springing necessarily out of a true and lively Faith"  This is what we contend for not a dead Faith that produceth nothing as you unjustly charge against us we know without much  Logic  that a dead Faith which produceth nothing cannot produce Salvation But it is a  lively Faith  which may be as evidently known as a Tree discerned by its Fruit And we do allow that good Works Works of Faith in  Jesus  Labours of Love to our God and Saviour shall by no means lose their Reward even a Reward of Grace not of Debt a Reward of Mercy not of Merit Therefore we wish and pray for the Increase of Holiness and the Practice of good Works We are grieved to see Iniquity abound We desire that the Love of  Jesus  to Sinners was more preached and insisted on than it is For we know were the Hearts of Men more affected with the Love the unexampled Love of our only Lord and Saviour  Jesus Christ  in laying down his Life to atone for their Sins and in purchasing for them a Title to eternal Glory this Love would constrain them to hate sin and love and obey him who so  loved them Humility Repentance Faith Holiness good Works and all the Graces of the Gospel would be more experienced among Men whereas filling Mens Heads with unscriptural Notions of their  comparative Merit  their  human Merit  and  Merit of one Man above another  only tends to counteract the Gospel by leading Men contrary to our Saviour's Doctrine to  trust in themselves that they are righteous and to despise others  to exalt instead of humbling them and keeps them from Repentance fills them with Pharisaical Pride and gives them the Language of  Come not near me for I am holier than thou  Isa lxv which is offensive to God instead of that humble and acceptable Cry  God be merciful to me a Sinner  And thro' Pride it keeps them in a high Conceit of their own Works and Deservings so as to slight and entertain very superficial Thoughts of the Love and Merits of our only Saviour so as not to believe on him for  Justification unto Life  And before a Person attains to this State our Church declares in Article XIII  of Works done before Justification  "ALL WORKS done before the Grace of  Christ  and the Inspiration of God's Holy Spirit are not pleasant to God for as much as they spring not of Faith in  Jesu Christ  neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace or as the SchoolAuthors say deserve Grace of Congruity for they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin"  But you assert  "some Men are better than others"  Do you mean by Nature if so you contradict the whole Tenor of God's Word which declares  all are Sinners there is no Difference for all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God  But you say  "there is a Difference in the Behaviour of Men"  'tis granted but our Church declares that neither the Behaviour of Men their Virtue or Morality or any Works they can do can merit or deserve Grace procure Justification or purchase a  Title to Glory  But what makes a Difference in Men Grace not Merit  by the Grace of God I am what I am  is the Language of every humble  Christian  as well as of a holy Apostle for thus argues the Apostle  Who maketh thee to differ  or distinguisheth thee  from another And what hast thou that thou didst not receive Now if thou didst receive  it why dost thou glory as if thou didst not receive it  Cor iv And again the same Apostle declares  by Grace ye are saved through Faith and that  Faith  not of yourselves it is the Gift of God not of Works left any Man should boast for God will have no Flesh to glory in his Presence  not upon any supposed Merit in himself  but he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord" Where is boasting then It is excluded by what Law of Works Nay but by the Law of Faith  If Salvation be by Grace then argues the Apostle  it is no more of Works otherwise Grace is no more Grace But if it be of Works then it is no more Grace otherwise Work is no more Work  Therefore we conclude a Man is justified his Sins pardon'd his Person accepted to God's Love and Favour and his Title to Glory is evidenced to him  by Faith  without the Deeds of the Law either  natural ceremonial  or  moral  saith the muchadmired  Burket  in his Exposition on this Chapter so that as St  Paul  declares  Rom  v  When we were without Strength in due Time Christ died for the Ungodly  And not as being holy just and righteous Persons are we justified by  Christ  but as Sinners as  the Ungodly  as the same Apostle declares  Rom  iv by being united to  Christ  by Faith we are as our Church expresses it Communion Service  one with Christ and Christ with us we dwell in Christ and Christ in us  Hence we partake of the Influences of that Holy Spirit whose gracious Office it is to  sanctify the Unholy  So  Milton  His Merit  Imputed shall absolve them who renounce  Their own both righteous and unrighteous Deeds  And live in HIM transplanted and from HIM  Receive new Life  And the venerable Reformers of our Church in the Homily of Salvation declare  "That this Saying that we be justified by Faith only freely and without Works is spoken to take away clearly  all  Merit of our Worksand therefore wholly to ascribe the Merit and Deserving of our Justification unto  Christ  ONLY and his most precious Bloodshedding This Faith the holy Scripture teaches us this is the strong Rock and Foundation of  Christian  Religion this Doctrine  all old and ancient Authors of  Christ  's Church do approve this Doctrine advanceth and setteth forth the true Glory of  Christ  and beateth down the vain Glory of Man this whoever denieth is not to be accounted a  Christian Man  nor for a Setterforth of  Christ  's Glory but for an ADVERSARY to  Christ  and his Gospel and for a Setterforth of Man's vain Glory"  Here you see how widely you differ in Judgment to our first Reformers who again in the Homily of good Works farther testify  "these Works the Apostle calleth Good Works  i e  Works becoming new Creatures in  Christ  saying  We are God's Workmanship created in  Christ Jesus  to good Works which God hath ordained we should walk in  and yet his Meaning is not by these Words to induce us to have  any  Affiance or put any Confidence in our Works as by the  Merit  and Deserving of them to purchase to ourselves Remission of Sins and so consequently everlasting Life for that were mere BLASPHEMY against God's Mercy and great Derogation to the Bloodshedding of our Saviour  Jesus Christ  For it is of the Free Grace and Mercy of God by the Mediation of the Blood of his Son  Jesus Christ  without Merit or Deserving on our Part that our Sins are forgiven us that we are reconciled and brought again into his Favour and are made Heirs of his heavenly Kingdom"  Here I rest the Evidence of our Church against what you have advanced and these scriptural Doctrines of our Church are my Principles these I firmly adhere to and abide by I know the Force of these divine these evangelic Truths and feel the Comfort and Happiness of them upon my own Mind I am nothing terrified by the Names of  Methodist  and  Enthusiast  c NickNames and Words of Reproach I can bear they neither disturb my Peace nor destroy my Comfort for  I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ  I glory in the Cross of JESUS and rejoice in that Salvation he hath
