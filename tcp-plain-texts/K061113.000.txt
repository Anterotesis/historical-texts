I  How bitter the moment with those we hold dear  When exchanging the tender adien  I follow'd you far with my eyes when a tear  Hid the object I lov'd from my view  I pensive retir'd to forget you ah vain  I found solitude cherish'd despair  In company sought a relief from my pain  Your dear image still follow'd me there  II  Thro'grove mead and garden I varied the scene  With fond hope some repose I might find  But still a lov'd spot where together we've been  Some lov'd incident brought to my mind  When I muse in the grove there I see your dear name  That I carv'd on the rind of a tree  In a garden I'm charm'd with a rosebud the same  Whence a flower you presented to me  III  I range thro' the me down attended by Tray  Once yourshis affection is prov'd  And the linnet's sweet pipe can blest raptures convey  When he carrols the tune that you lov'd  By moonlight I walk I enjoy her mild rays  And this heart soothing fancy pursue  I think at the instant whilst on her I gaze  She then may be look'd on by you  Eh isn't this MrParrots the celebrated Irish mimick Ha ha ha A capital mistake in talent his attempts to imitate every character and dialect the most opposite yet with such an invincible brogue that when he fancies he speaks or sings a variety of voices you can only think yourself in a debating society at Tipperary  Enter  Parrots  and  Servant  Parrots  Waiter prepare me a good breakfast of some tea and cakes but if you can't get three new laid eggs you may eat them all yourselfCaptain Clifford how do you do sir  Capt C  Ha Mr Parrots true I saw your bills for performance  Parrots  Yes sir I'm come to give my imitations and have hir'd a fine big room but such a bushel of troubles  Capt C  I'm glad you're come Parrots I wanted something to laugh at this place is very pleasant eh the Steine and Downs and bathing  Parrots  Bathing oh a blessed affair happen'd to me the very day I arriv'd I was so afraid of nobody coming to hear me that I was about to go back to London so I took my place in the  machine but instead of a stage coach they put me into a wooden closet and dragg'd me into the sea Hallo says I let me out Off with your cloaths says the fellow and tumble out here headlong  Capt C  Ha ha ha  Parrots  Well I thought I'd stay here a few days longer if only to pick up among their bathing shops and raffling Machines a new stock of originals and faith I've been at them eves dropping about every where why t'other night in the playhouse I had a Scotch presbyterian calling to the music for God save the King A French marquis bawling for Roast Beef and an Irishman roaring for Rule Britannia  Capt C  Oh you've him at your tongue's end  Parrots  Who the Irishman now there you're out he has such a devil of a brogue that he's the only person there I cannot mimick neatly  AIRPARROTS  I'M the man that can take off every fowl  From the singing Lark to the barking Dog    Hark the Lark  mimicks  now the Dog    All beasts I can mimick upon my foul  From the cackling Hen to the grunting Hog    Tie Hen  mimicks  the Hog  mimicks  All's food for wit that falls into my dish  Like crowing Cock I'm a fine birdcall  And yet I cannot well mimick a fish  Because that a fish says nothing at all  Burden  At all jolly parties I make a rout  I'm call'd for my song for a joaker I pass  But some how or otherI bring it about  That the people all think me a fine jackAss  II  At Hanover Square when your Concert plays  Like them I can Presto Piano too  presto piano  I sing and I whistle with so much ease  The black Crow's neat song and the tight Cuckow  Lo the Crow the Cuckow  The sawing Boards and the drawing of Cork  And water as dropping drop drop drop  I tune up my pipe with my great pitchfork  At the bottom now and now at the top  BURDEN  At all jolly parties I make a rout  I'm call'd for my song for a joaker I pass  But some how or other I bring it about  That the people all think me a fine JackAss  Capt C  Ha ha ha this offers something for old Cypress  Aside  Mr Parrots if you shou'dn't be encouraged here equal to your merits you may easily get money for your travelling expences however  Parrots  Then how my dear sir  Capt C  ListenA gentleman here had an old friend whom he once insulted grossly this friend hadn't spirit to resent it himseif yet dying lately carried his resentment to his last breath absolutely in his will left a legacy of a hundred pounds to any one that wou'd cane him on the open Steine Now suppose you were to  Parrots  Beat a gentleman you don't catch me at that Captain  Capt C  Why besides touching the Cash you chastise an impudent little rascal  Parrots  If I was to chastise all the impudent rascals I shou'd have five firsts for everyone of my ten fingers thumbs and all  Cap C  Interest is not the string I must touch the Hibernian's courage  aside  I don't think the legacy will ever be claim'd tho' the money is a temptation yet nobody hitherto has ventured to win it by striking him he's a remarkably strong little fellow indeed full of tricks with his strength when he gets a bottle twisting pokers round his neck battering pewter pots with his forehead they talk here but I never believ'd it that the cause of the east cliffs falling was his shoving in a drunken sit one of the great guns off the battery yes yes it requires a deal of resolution to  Parrots  Why sir d'ye think I'm afraid upon the Steine you say any particular time mention'd in the will  Cap C  Eh yonder is old Cypress  aside  when there's a good deal of company about now a propos look that's your man  Parrots  What that clergyman bowing to the ladies or the man in deep mourning laughing so hearty  looking out  Cap C  Pho dem it look there  Parrots  Oh the little squab lad in the bob wig and blue and silver coat But Captain if I do win this legacy who's to pay it me  Cap C  Zounds what name oh any  aside  eh oneone Captain Tomkins is the executor  Parrots  But where does he live  Cap C  Any body will tell you look that's his house  points  Parrots  Very well  Cap C  Here's jack Daily he'll be dragging me to the bottle  going  Enter an  Officer  tipsey  Officer  Ha ha ha hollo Clifford by heavens you're a fine fellow to slip off so  Capt C  Pho never mind me there's a lady that I  Officer  Zounds meet a lady with such a sober stupid face Dem it come along my boy  sings  "for Venus ne'er looks with a smile so divine"  drags him off  Parrots  To get my bottle I must first touch the  corks  he's here a hundred pounds is a good thing but beating him in cold bloodby my foul I'd rather get a threshing myself so that nobddy might know it than strike a man that has never done me any harmBut a stick is necessary  Exit into shop  Enter  CYPRESS  with newspaper  Cypress
