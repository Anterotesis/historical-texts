 THE SCHOOL FOR GUARDIANS  A COMEDY  As it is Performing at the THEATREROYAL in COVENTGARDEN  Sabitum et miserabile longum Attendit Thymele Thymele tune rustica discit  JUV  LONDON Printed for P VAILLANT in the Strand MDCCLXVII  Price One Shilling and Six Pence  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following play was written above three years ago and was soon after shewn to some of the principal performers of both houses It took its rise from Miss ELLIOT'S being advised to revive  The Country Wife  for her benefit the first season of her engagement at CoventGarden theatre That play upon a review of it appeared inadmissible on account of the obscenity which discolours the whole The author or rather the compiler of the ensuing scenes undertook to alter WYCHERLEY's play for Miss ELLIOT against the following winter but hearing in the mean time that Mr BICKERSTAFF had employed himself upon one of WYCHERLEY's pieces he made it his business to see that gentleman lest this writer should interfere with a plan already preoccupied He found that the PLAIN DEALER had been Mr BICKERSTAFF's object and that there was no danger of clashing with the scheme of any other author Upon a closer examination therefore of  The Country Wife  it was thought proper to desert it intirely and to resort to MOLIERE the original master whom WYCHERLEY copied The celebrated comedy of  L'Ecole de Femmes  appeared too thin of business consisting mostly in narrative To supply that deficiency the design occurred of making MOLIERE himself supply the requisite materials and for this purpose L'ETOURDIE and L'Ecole DE MARIS were called in as auxiliaries Upon this idea the play was soon finished and it consists of characters situations and business from those three plays interwoven into one fable with as much skill as a little leisure in the summer time would permit With the professed design of condensing what appeared to be the best of three performances into one play it was deemed unnecessary to suppress any one scene of true nature merely because the author of  High Life below Stairs  and some other English writers might occasionally be  tracked in the snow of Moliere  The play when finished was given to Miss ELLIOT and it so happened that she had no opportunity of producing it till this season When in September last her bargain both for herself and the play was in agitation with Mr BEARD the author of these sheets was astonished to hear that  The Country Girl  was actually in rehearsal at Drury Lane and that the parts had been given out in the summer nay  as fast as they were written  This it must not be dissembled looked like a  design of forestalling the market  especially as it was understood that Miss ELLIOT and the SCHOOL FOR GUARDIANS had been offered the spring before to the manager of Drury Lane  upon his own terms  A remonstrance was immediately made to Mr GARRICK purporting that he who had long been a manager of a successful theatre was going to enter into a competition with a young actress for the profits of a play A meeting ensued where a gentleman of the first character for probity and genius was so obliging as to be the arbitrator Mr GARRICK there protesting that he never heard of Miss ELLIOT's play till within a few days it was thereupon determined that it was in that case an accidental clashing but that a design of  forestalling  would have been illiberal and unhandsome This last point of honour Mr GARRICK seemed to learn upon this occasion  Both parties were in consequence left to pursue their own interests And now the present writer will dismiss THE SCHOOL FOR GUARDIANS after saying that he composed it with the most disinterested principle and that if it prove in any degree conducive to the service of a young actress or the public entertainment he has all the reward he ever proposed to himself  N B  An entire scene in the second act page has been omitted since the first representation and would have been discarded from this edition but that the greatest part of the play was printed before it was acted  PROLOGUE  Spoken by MISS ELLIOT  MAY I intrude upon your patience for a minute  Ladies and gentlemen before the opening of the play  Just to excuse an accident which I hope has no mischief in it  I fain if you'll permit a word or two would say  I hope you'll not be angry but we've got no prologue for to night  And so I thought it was best to come and tell ye all the truth downright  I went to Mr Poet and I spoke to him all I could  But he said he had not leisure tho' I know it's in his power if he would  "A prologue ma'am" says he"Yes Sir a prologue if you please"  And then I did so entreat the man and beg and pray and teaze  I told him "You know Sir what a miserable plight we all are in  To frown upon the performers when pit box and gallery begin  Whugo the catcallsdubdubdubeach dreadful critick's stick  Prólog  ' throw him overwon't ye ha some orange chips  Prólôgué  Cries o' LondonMusick"  All this and more I said but he determin'd still  In formal fustian thus declar'd his will  "Oft have I tried"  seems puzzled  something about his stile  And how he felt the Town's indulgent smile  "Were I again to try my scanty vein  I'd beg protection for the feeble strain  But then to suehe paus'd and rubb'd his head  To suewhen fam'd MOLIERE the stage doth tread  Were to prophane the manes of the dead  MOLIERE of old and still with rapture seen  Was legislator of the comic scene  To bid his SIMPLE GIRL assert the stage  And if she pleases strive to mend the age  This was my motivethis my only aim  Heedless of gainno candidate for fame  An audience will weigh all in equal scales  For justice and not party there prevails"  Thus spoke MrPoet and then with long steps march'd away  And now I am left alone to apologize for offering you this night's play  We'll strive to make you laugh if our aim be not perverted  Pray how d'ye find yourselvesAre ye in good humour and willing to be diverted  If you approve  The  Rostiad Scribbler  then no more I'll dread  Who points his malice at a woman's head  Who drop by drop his venom doth distil  While MOTHERDULLNESS guides the hireling's quill  Lull'd in her lap strange wonders he descries  And TERENCE seemsa Frenchman to his eyes  From thence he issues soul decrees on plays  Adorns with scandal and lampoons with praise  One smile from you defeats the sland'rer's aim  His calumny like your APPLAUSE is fame  From your applause our mimic glories rise  In pleasing you my whole ambition lies  EPILOGUE  Spoken by MISS ELLIOT  LAdies your servantServant gentlemen all  The same good folks to youboth great and small  Here's MARY ANN againbut that an't fair  To jeer a simple girl you might forbear  Who knows since marriedtho' you laugh and gaze  But MARY ANN may learn your London ways  May ape your fashions since you've shewn her how  And drop the mask at onceas I do now  Thus you beholdwhatever the condition  To new extremes how easy the transition  'Tis so thro'lifeto town from country fairs  The clown comes up and gapes and laughs and stares  Give him a liv'rywhims unknown before  He learns his master's follies to do o'er  He drinks  u  s coxcomb and betts five to four  Pray may I ladies touch your modish life  And shew good sense and fashion there at strife  "Oh do Miss Elliot says a prude with spite  Pull'em to pieces bring their faults to light  Pulling to pieces is my dear delight"  Why then each fair one seems a diff'rent creature  From what she's meant and travesties her nature  Proud of defects FLIRTILLA swims along  Politely weak and elegantly wrong  Thro' the gay round of time her only care  To fix the patch and guide a straggling hair  Lady CAMILLA form'd to seize the rein  To rival John and smack along the plain  In London sickens with dissembled airs  And "help mehelp me up these odious stairs"  Nature's best gifts we all with pride disclaim  We lisp we totter deaf and blind and lame  The tongue indeed we women ne'er confine  Scandal's too dear a pleasure to resign  Scandal and cards tea mirth and spleen a ball  Comusthe monkey tooand there's the life of'all  A life of whimtill from she faded eye  And wither'd form the trembling graces fly  There's a true picturehow do ye like it ladies  How is the light and how do ye think the shade is  A copy hence our simple girl may make  Unless she should this wiser counsel take  Be rul'd by reason for your beauty's sake  Reason still gives to radiant eyes their grace  Warren's imperial milk  for ev'ry face  Beauty ye fair may forge the lover's chain  But the mind's charms your empire must maintain  Dramatis Personae  SIR THEODORE BRUMPTON  Mr WALKER  YOUNG BRUMPTON  Mr WOODWARD  BELLFORD  Mr SMITH  OLDCASTLE  Mr SHUTER  LOVIBOND  Mr DUNSTALL

one of the wits of Charles the lld's time to his dog when he was too lazy to beat him "I wish you well married and settled in the country"  Sir Theodore  There again now don't enrage me I have some whimsical humours about me that let me tell you Sirand I can be very peremptory if I pleaseWhat when my neighbour Strickland and I have agreed the mattera young lady with a fair fortune in hand and seven hundred a year in expectancy as pretty a reversion as any in Hampshire and am I now to be told "She does not suit my tasteshe is not handsome" and so I am to be  wasting my breath with you about

between just and earnestBut don't talk to me of beauty again I never knew any good come of it beauty is like fine fruit only fit to draw a parcel of flies about it  Brumpton  And so I must set my teeth on edge with crabtree applesBut where would be the harm Sir if purely for the good of my family I were to marry a lady of some share of beauty only just to cross the strain a little and settle a shape and a feature upon the issue of our marriage  Sir Theodore  Settle your wife's fortune upon 'emLook ye Sirmy purse strings will never open  not a shilling of my money shall you touch till you

now you'll drop all thoughts of this other ladyI forget her nameAy miss Mary Ann RichleyShe has no chance now I reckon Sir  Brumpton  Why you senseless numskullas sure as I am Charles Brumpton  Esq  she shall be Mrs Brumpton and upon the death of my very good father she'll be a baronet's lady that's all  Brisk  And yet there is some truth in what Sir Theodore saysBeauty is but a frail perishable sort of a commodity and if you are disinherited for it the lady's charms will not pay your poor servant Brisk his boardwages a feature or a smile can't go to market a pawnbroker will lend nothing upon the tip of an ear though indeed she may mortgage her person but that I take it will be for her own advantage we shall get nothing but a comely pair of horns by it Sir with submission  Brumpton  Why you talk a frothy kind of nothing at a tolerable rate Brisk  Brisk  I have shewn you one side of the medal now behold the reverse SirWhen you marry an ugly woman there is no great pleasure in beholding her and to be sure when you look at her you'll be apt to murmur to yourselffor all purposes of joy one may cut as desirable an object out of an old tapestryhangingbut then the woman has some valuable parchments such as leases bonds and mortgages and I Sir shall live in tolerable plight with you which to so good a master  Brumpton  Leave prating sirrah and do as I ordered youput on your farmer's dress go directly to the object I adorelet her know you are come from her guardian in the country and have his orders to take her home under your careconvey her safe to my arms and I shall

door  Brisk  I am gone Sir  Exit  Brumpton  Ha haI shall most certainly carry her offHow Sir Theodore will be astonished when he finds she is an heiressHa hait is the pleasantest adventure  Enter  Belford  Belford  Brumpton good morrowalways in spirits I see  Brumpton  My dear Belford nothing depresses my spiritsthough you thought they were too high last night and were for letting me a little blood Death  man you make nothing of displaying an ell of swordblade in defence of your mistress's topknot  Belford  Why you know I love too tenderly to bear the test of railleryit is the infirmity of my temper why would you put me to it  Brumpton  And you that know my turn of mind why would you be angry with meI am happily a follower of the laughing philosopher  Belford  Po prithee man don't be such a coxcomb  Brumpton  Prithee don't you be so morose so sour so discontented a spiritBut if in your phrase I am a coxcomb with all my heart i'faith but take this along with youwhat you mean as a term of reproach I receive as a compliment to the materials nature has been pleased to compound in this happy frame of mine  Belford  Po Po running on at the old rateIf selfapplause be philosophy you have a comfortable share  Brumpton  I have Sir and while my happiness is preserved by it keep you the gravity and good sense that make you too refined to be pleased too wise to be merry and too knowing to be contentedI am in a fair way to be successful without any trouble at allyou are likely to be most scurvily disappointed after a world of painsAn humble bow which my dancingmaster taught me while I laughed at him a fashionable coat for which if my taylor is ever paid he will laugh at mean intriguing snuffbox and an apt valet de chambre all these make love for me and  Belford  And you assume the merit of the conquest  Brumpton  Oh yes when the trouble is over I take the rewardDid you ever know a general officer who when the horse and the foot and the right and left wing have carried the day for him did not claim to himself both the honour and the booty  But you make a toil of a pleasurelove which to me is a scene of delight to you is a drudgery your temper grows as sour as a prude's when the sermon is long and as hot as a Welshman's if you laugh at his pedigree or a professed sharper's if you doubt his honour after he has cogged the dice and picked your pocket of your money  Belford  Why I own I am piqued and naturally If any friend of mine out of mere spleen speak detractingly of the person I admire it were base infidelity in love not to defend her when she is disparagedmy every thought is dedicated to herAbsent I see her hear her and my imagination gloats for ever on her charms  Brumpton  And you are so easily alarmed that little difficulties are the Alps and Pireneans in your wayNow my faith in these matters removes mountainsBut indeed in all things we are opposite charactersIf a tradesman brings you in a bill and presses for payment  'Sdeath does the scoundrel doubt my honour does he mean to affront me  Now I when my father suffered me to be arrested went cheerfully into confinement and diverted myself for three weeks together with the bumbailiff's characterIn the business of our softer passions the same humour pursues usyou write studied letters to your Dulcinea I am written toyou sigh I singyou fret I am gayyou upon a disappointment  Furies death and ragethere is no enduring thislife is grown a burdendamnation  I burst into a laugh and what a whimsical world we live inha haBut come I will hear your melancholy storyWell the old dragon I suppose watches the Hesperian fruit  Belford  He does Sirhe keeps her locked up as a miler does his gold not to be made use of till his death and then to fall into hands that won't know the value of itIts love's last shift with me she is inaccessible and her guardian old Lovibond proposes to marry her himself  Brumpton  And so like the tyrant of old intends to tack a living and dead body together  Belford  Even somy dear Brumpton there should be an act of parliament to hinder these old fellows from stopping the propagation of the species  Brumpton  You are too hard upon 'emthey are seldom guilty of that mischiefI have known 'em have twins at a birth that is when some such coxcomb as myself gives them a helping handand then the old fellow cocks his hat upon it and totters about so vigorously wondering how the babes resemble him in every particular whilst the mother knows that she followed the example of the Grecian painter and took a feature from every one of her acquaintanceIf he prevents your marrying her take your revenge that way  Belford  Prophanationher virtue Sirbesides the world could never repair the lossher heart I am sure is mineI used to visit therebut now no admittance an evidence on the crown side in a messenger's hands is not better secured  Brompton  Now my business goes on without any trouble or difficulty My old dragon is in the country and has left his fair ward the sweetest girl my dear Belford  Belford  You described her yesterday but few removes from a downright idiot  Brumpton  Pardon meshe is simple indeedBut such a simplicityIt just serves to shew that injustice has been done her in her education but in her every turn she gives such tokens of sensibilityShe has beauty without knowing itcertain wild graces rather than accomplishments and talents instead of sense  Belford  Po Poa mere rustic beauty  Brumpton  There now derogating from her merit and yet I am calmthe truth is she has been brought up in the country and wickedly kept in ignorance  that she might fall an easy prey to her guardianBut I have raised a spirit in her  Belford  And how the devil did you gain access to her  Brumpton  I was going to tell youOld Nestor's out of town and has left her in the care of the two veriest simpletons that ever whistled for want of thought at a country fairBut gold Sir gold that speaks all languages and adapts itself to all capacities has pleaded most eloquently for meBut come I positively must leave you  Belford  Nay if it must be so  Brumpton  My dear Belford Cupid direct your arrows  I see her every day and all the day  And every day is still but as the first  So eager am I still to see her more  Exeunt  SCENE  a Street  Enter  Lovibond  and  Oldcastle  Lovibond  And but this moment

any apprehension for yourself you are still determined to marry Mary Ann's sister Harriet I suppose  Lovibond  That's quite another business what I do is no rule for your actions  Oldcastle  It is as I ever saideach man is still looking at the hump upon his neighbour's back but never thinks of casting an eye over his own shoulderI warrant me now you in your grand climacteric will tell me I am old  Lovibond  Full ten years before me in the race of lifebesides you are an old batchelora stranger to the ways of wedlockI am enured to the serviceyour sister Mr Oldcastle could have told you what a desperate good husband I wasBut lack a day you begin latemercy on your forehead say I mercy on your forehead  Oldcastle  Ha ha how blind some people are when they have taken a thing in their headsha ha  Lovibond  Well well laugh onbut you that have been for ever a censor of your neighbours for ever fleering and jibing at the married life  Oldcastle  And a pleasant topic it isWhy matrimony affords a little comedy in every family one knowsBut the education I have given Mary Ann  Lovibond  Is the worst in the world  Oldcastle  The very bestI have trained her up in plain simplicitywoman's wit teems with contrivances to disgrace her husbandyet you would educate Harriet in this profligate town  Lovibond  Ay and I have taught her to know right from wrong  Oldcastle  Right from wrong you have ruined the girlhave not you indulged her in every whimsy this fertile town affords  Lovibond  I have shewn her the world  Oldcastle  Have not you carried her to plays  Lovibond  To see folly ridiculed  Oldcastle  To profligate comedies  Lovibond  The stage is the school of virtue  Oldcastle  The school of sin and impudence  Lovibond  Where vice undergoes the lash of satire  Oldcastle  Where vice is made alluring provoking  Lovibond  Where young ladies may learn  Oldcastle  The use of darkclosets backstairs and ladders of rope  Lovibond  Where they may learn to put on the veil of modesty  Oldcastle  To put on the breeches and escape from their guardians  Lovibond  Where they are taught to respect greyheaded authority  Oldcastle  To make a cuckold of authorityI know the ways of 'em alltheir cards routs operas Sohoassemblies all contrivances to excite curiosity kindle desire prompt inclination and send 'em all dancing a jig to destruction  Lovibond  Commonplace invectiveHarriet will know how to avoid  Oldcastle  She will know how to deceive you  Lovibond  She will have too much honour  Oldcastle  She will have too much witnow Mary Ann has no wild notions and of course no dangerous curiosity  Lovibond  Her curiosity is to comeshe'll fall a prey to the first powdered coxcomb that bows to her  Oldcastle  Her simplicity will preserve her  Lovibond  But when the serpents of this town begin to whisper in her ear  Oldcastle  They'll have no opportunityShe is snug in a little box of an house which I have taken in the name of Mr Biddulph I have another lodging in my own name where I do businessNobody will see her and when the nine day's wonder is over  I shall pack off to the country and so escape from impertinence  Lovibond  Well wellI can't but laugh at your system of education ha haMarry her if you willand then on account of your age and infirmities you may do the business of your office by deputyHa ha a plan of simplicity  Oldcastle  Brother Lovibond a good
