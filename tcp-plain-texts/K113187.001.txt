 THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY FROM THE CLOSE of the ELEVENTH TO THE COMMENCEMENT of the EIGHTEENTH CENTURY TO WHICH ARE PREFIXED TWO DISSERTATIONS I ON THE ORIGIN OF ROMANTIC FICTION IN EUROPE II ON

BLANDFORD KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER of the GARTER A JUDGE AND A PATRON OF THE POLITE ARTS THIS WORK IS MOST HUMBLY INSCRIBED  By his Grace's most obliged And most obedient Servant THOMAS WARTON  PREFACE  IN an age advanced to the highest degree of refinement that species of curiosity commences which is busied in contemplating the progress of social life in displaying the gradations of science and in tracing the transitions from barbarism to civility  That these speculations should become the favourite pursuits and the fashionable topics of such a period is extremely natural We look back on the savage condition of our ancestors with the triumph of superiority we are pleased to mark the steps by which we have been raised from rudeness to elegance and our reflections on this subject are accompanied with a conscious pride arising in great measure from a tacit comparison of the infinite disproportion between the feeble efforts of remote ages and our present improvements in knowledge  In the mean time the manners monuments customs practices and opinions of antiquity by forming so strong a contrast with those of our own times and by exhibiting human nature and human inventions in new lights in in unexpected appearances and in various forms are objects which forcibly strike a feeling imagination  Nor does this spectacle afford nothing more than a fruitless gratification to the fancy It teaches us to set a just estimation on our own acquisitions and encourages us to cherish that cultivation which is so closely connected with the existence and the exercise of every social virtue  On these principles to develop the dawnings of genius and to pursue the progress of our national poetry from a rude origin and obscure beginnings to its perfection in a polished age must prove an interesting and instructive investigation But a history of poetry for another reason yet on the same principles must be more especially productive of entertainment and utility I mean as it is an art whose object is human society as it has the peculiar merit in its operations on that object of faithfully recording the features of the times and of preserving  the most picturesque and expressive representations of manners and because the first monuments of composition in every nation are those of the poet as it possesses the additional advantage of transmitting to posterity genuine delineations of life in its simplest stages Let me add that anecdotes of the rudiments of a favourite art will always be particularly pleasing The more early specimens of poetry must ever amuse in proportion to the pleasure which we receive from its finished productions  Much however depends on the execution of such a design and my readers are to decide in what degree I have done justice to so specious and promising a disquisition Yet a few more words will not be perhaps improper in vindication or rather in explanation of the manner in which my work has been conducted I am sure I do not mean nor can I pretend to apologise for its defects  I have chose to exhibit the history of our poetry in a chronological series not distributing my matter into detached articles of periodical divisions or of general heads Yet I have not always adhered so scrupulously to the regularity of annals but that I  have often deviated into incidental digressions and have sometimes stopped in the course of my career for the sake of recapitulation for the purpose of collecting scattered notices into a single and uniform point of view for the more exact inspection of a topic which required a separate consideration or for a comparative survey of the poetry of other nations  A few years ago Mr MASON with that liberality which ever accompanies true genius gave me an authentic copy of Mr POPE'S scheme of a History of English Poetry in which our poets were classed under their supposed respective schools The late lamented Mr GRAY had also projected a work of this kind and translated some Runic odes for its illustration now published but soon relinquishing the prosecution of a design which would have detained him from his own noble inventions he most obligingly condescended to favour me with the substance of his plan which I found to be that of Mr POPE considerably enlarged extended and improved  It is vanity in me to have mentioned these communications But I am apprehensive my vanity will justly be thought much greater when it shall appear that in giving the history of English poetry  I have rejected the ideas of men who are its most distinguished ornaments To confess the real truth upon examination and experiment I soon discovered their mode of treating my subject plausible as it is and brilliant in theory to be attended with difficulties and inconveniencies and productive of embarassment both to the reader and the writer Like other ingenious systems it sacrificed much useful intelligence to the observance of arrangement and in the place of that satisfaction which results from a clearness and a fulness of information seemed only to substitute the merit of disposition and the praise of contrivance The constraint imposed by a mechanical attention to this distribution appeared to me to destroy that free exertion of research with which such a history ought to be executed and not easily reconcileable with that complication variety and extent of materials which it ought to comprehend  The method I have pursued on one account at least seems preferable to all others My performance in its present form exhibits without transposition the gradual improvements of our poetry at the same time that it uniformly represents the progression of our language  Some perhaps will be of opinion that these annals ought to have commenced with a view of the Saxon poetry But besides that a legitimate illustration of that jejune and intricate subject would have almost doubled my labour that the Saxon language is familiar only to a few learned antiquaries that our Saxon poems are for the most part little more than religious rhapsodies and that scarce any compositions remain marked with the native images of that people in their pagan state every reader that reflects but for a moment on our political establishment must perceive that the Saxon poetry has no connection with the nature and purpose of my present undertaking Before the Norman accession which succeeded to the Saxon government we were an unformed and an unsettled race That mighty revolution obliterated almost all relation to the former inhabitants of this island and produced that signal change in our policy constitution and public manners the effects of which have reached modern times The beginning of these annals seems therefore to be most properly dated from that era when our national character began to dawn  It was recommended to me by a person eminent in the republic of letters totally to exclude from  these volumes any mention of the English drama I am very sensible that a just history of our Stage is alone sufficient to form an entire and extensive work and this argument which is by no means precluded by the attempt here offered to the public still remains separately to be discussed at large and in form But as it was professedly my intention to comprise every species of English Poetry this among the rest of course claimed a place in these annals and necessarily fell into my general design At the same time as in this situation it could only become a subordinate object it was impossible I should examine it with that critical precision and particularity which so large so curious and so important an article of our poetical literature demands and deserves To have considered it in its full extent would have produced the unwieldy excrescence of a disproportionate episode not to have considered it at all had been an omission which must detract from the integrity of my intended plan I flatter myself however that from evidences hitherto unexplored I have recovered hints which may facilitate the labours of those who shall hereafter be inclined to investigate the antient state of dramatic exhibition in this country with due comprehension and accuracy  It will probably be remarked that the citations in the first volume are numerous and sometimes very prolix But it should be remembered that most of these are extracted from antient manuscript poems never before printed and hitherto but little known Nor was it easy to illustrate the darker and more distant periods of our poetry without producing ample specimens In the mean time I hope to merit the thanks of the antiquarian for enriching the stock of our early literature by these new accessions and I trust I shall gratify the reader of taste in having so frequently rescued from oblivion the rude inventions and irregular beauties of the heroic tale or the romantic legend  The design of the DISSERTATIONS is to prepare the reader by considering apart in a connected and comprehensive detail some material points of a general and preliminary nature and which could not either with equal propriety or convenience be introduced at least not so formally discussed in the body of the book to establish certain fundamental principles to which frequent appeals might occasionally be made and to clear the way for various observations arising in the course of my future

peculiar and arbitrary species of Fiction which we commonly call Romantic was entirely unknown to the writers of Greece and Rome It appears to have been imported into Europe by a people whose modes of thinking and habits of invention are not natural to that country It is generally supposed to have been borrowed from the Arabians But this origin has not been hitherto perhaps examined or ascertained with a sufficient degree of accuracy It is my present design by a more distinct and extended inquiry than has yet been applied to the subject to trace the manner and the period of its introduction into the popular belief the oral poetry and the literature of the Europeans  It is an established maxim of modern criticism that the fictions of Arabian imagination were communicated to the  western world by means of the crusades Undoubtedly those expeditions greatly contributed to propagate this mode of fabling in Europe But it is evident although a circumstance which certainly makes no material difference as to the principles here established that these fancies were introduced at a much earlier period The Saracens or Arabians having been for some time seated on the northern coasts of Africa entered Spain about the beginning of the eighth century  See ALMAKIN edit Pocock p  Of this country they soon effected a complete conquest and imposing their religion language and customs upon the inhabitants erected a royal seat in the capital city of Cordoua  That by means of this establishment they first revived the sciences of Greece in Europe will be proved at large in another place  See the second Dissertation  and it is obvious to conclude that at the same time they disseminated those extravagant inventions which were so peculiar to their romantic and creative genius A manuscript cited by Du Cange acquaints us that the Spaniards soon after the irruption of the Saracens entirely neglected the study of the Latin language and captivated with the novelty of the oriental books imported by these strangers suddenly adopted an unusual pomp of style and an affected elevation of diction  "Arabico eloquio  sublimati  c  Du Cang Gloss Med Inf Latinitat tom i Praef p xxvii §  The ideal tales of these eastern invaders recommended by a brilliancy of description a variety of imagery and an exuberance of invention hitherto unknown and unfamiliar to the cold and barren conceptions of a western climate were eagerly caught up and universally diffused From Spain by the communications of a constant commercial intercourse through the ports of Toulon and Marseilles they soon passed into France and Italy  In France no province or district seems to have given these fictions of the Arabians a more welcome or a more early reception than the inhabitants of Armorica or Basse Bretagne now Britany for no part of France can boast so great a number of antient romances  The reason on which this conclusion is founded will appear hereafter  Many poems of high antiquity composed by the Armorican bards still remain  In the British Museum is a set of old French tales of chivalry in verse written as it seems by the bards of Bretagne MSS Harl  "TRISTRAM a WALES"  is mentioned f b

chamber painted with Venus and the three mysteries of nature and the allusion to Ovid prove the tales before us to be of no very high antiquity But they are undoubtedly taken from others much older of the same country At the end of ELIDUC'S tale we have these lines f  Del aventure de ces trais  Li  auntien  BRITUN curteis  Firent  le lai  pour remember  Q'hum nel deust pas oublier  And under the tale of FRESNE f  Li BRITUN enfirent un  lai  At the conclusion of most of the tales it is said that these LAIS were made by the poets of Bretaigne Another of the tales is thus closed f  Que cest

BRETAGNE ii tom fol  This territory was as it were newly peopled in the fourth century by a colony or army of the Welsh who migrated thither under the conduct of Maximus a Roman general in Britain  Maximus appears to have set up a separate interest in Britain and to have engaged an army of the provincial Britons on his side against the Romans Not succeeding in his designs he was obliged to retire with his British troops to the continent as in the text He had a considerable interest in Wales having married Ellena daughter of Eudda a powerful chieftain of Northwales She was born at Caernarvon where her chapel is still shewn Mon Antiq p seq  and Conan  lord of Meiriadoc or Denbighland  See Hist de Bretagne par d'Argentre p Powel's WALES p seq and p edit Lhuyd's Etymol p col And Galfrid Mon HIST BRIT Lib v c vii ix Compare Borlase Antiq Cornwall B i ch p  The Armoric language now spoken in Britany is a dialect of the Welsh and so strong a resemblance still subsists between the two languages that in our late conquest of Belleisle such of our soldiers as were natives of Wales were understood by the peasantry Milton whose imagination was much struck with the old British story more than once alludes to the Welsh colony planted in Armorica by Maximus and the prince of Meiriadoc  Et tandem ARMORICOS Britonum sub lege colonos  MANSUS    And in the PARADISE LOST he mentions indiscriminately the knights of Wales and Armorica as the customary retinue of king Arthur  What resounds  In fable or romance of Uther's son  Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC knights  Parad L i Compare Pelloutier MEM sur la Langue Celt fol tom i    This migration of the Welsh into Britany or Armorica which during the distractions of the empire in consequence of the numerous armies of barbarians with which Rome was surrounded on every side had thrown off its dependence on the Romans seems to have occasioned a close connection between the two countries for many centuries  This secession of the Welsh at so critical a period was extremely natural into a neighbouring maritime country with which they had constantly trafficked and which like themselves had disclaimed the Roman yoke It is not related in any Greek or Roman historian But their silence is by no means a sufficient warrant for us to reject the numerous testimonies of the old British writers concerning this event It is mentioned in particular by Llywarchen a famous bard who lived only one hundred and fifty years afterwards Many of his poems are still extant in which he celebrates his twentyfour sons who wore gold chains and were all killed in battles against the Saxons  Nor will  it prove less necessary to our purpose to observe that the Cornish Britons whose language was another dialect of the antient British from the fourth or fifth century downwards maintained a no less intimate correspondence with the natives of Armorica intermarrying with them and perpetually resorting thither for the education of their children for advice for procuring troops against the Saxons for the purposes of traffick and various other occasions This connection was so strongly kept up that an ingenious French antiquary supposes that the communications of the Armoricans with the Cornish had chiefly contributed to give a roughness or rather hardness to the romance or French language in some of the provinces towards the eleventh century which was not before discernible  M l'Abbé Lebeuf RECHERCHES c Mem de Litt tom xvii p edit to  "Je pense que cela dura jusqu'à ce que le commerce de ces provinces avec les peuples du Nord et de l'Allemagne et SUR TOUT celui des HABITANS DE L'ARMORIQUE AVEC L'ANGLOIS vers l'onzieme siecle c"  And this intercourse will appear more natural if we consider that not only Armorica a maritime province of Gaul never much frequented by the Romans and now totally deserted by them was still in some measure a Celtic nation but that also the inhabitants of Cornwall together with those of Devonshire and of the adjoining parts of Somersetshire intermixing in a very slight degree with the Romans and having suffered fewer important alterations in their original constitution and customs from the imperial laws and police than any other province of this island long preserved their genuine manners and British character and forming a sort of separate principality under the government of a succession of powerful chieftains usually denominated princes or dukes of Cornwall remained partly in a state of independence during the Saxon heptarchy and were not entirely reduced till the Norman conquest Cornwall in particular retained its old Celtic dialect till the reign of Elizabeth  See Camd Brit i edit Lhuyd's Arch p    And here I digress a moment to remark that in the circumstance just mentioned about Wales of its connection with Armorica we perceive the solution of a difficulty which at first sight appears extremely problematical I mean not only that Wales should have been so constantly made the theatre of the old British chivalry but that so many of the favorite fictions which occur in the early French romances should also be literally found in the tales and chronicles of the elder Welsh bards  The story of LE COURT MANTEL or the BOY AND THE MANTLE told by an old French troubadour cited by M de Sainte Palaye is recorded in many manuscript Welsh chronicles as I learn from original letters of Lhuyd in the Ashmolean Museum See Mem Anc Chev i And Obs Spenser i § ii p And from the same authority I am informed that the fiction of the giant's coat composed of the beards of the kings whom he had conquered is related in the legends of the bards of both countries See Obs Spens ut supr p seq But instances are innumerable  It was owing to the perpetual communication kept up between the Welsh and the people of Armorica who abounded in these fictions and who naturally took occasion to interweave them into the history of their friends and allies Nor are we now at a loss to give the reason why Cornwall in the same French romances is made the scene and the subject of so many romantic adventures  Hence in the Armorican tales just quoted mention is made of Totness and Exeter anciently included in Cornwall In Chaucer's ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE we have  "Hornpipis of Cornewaile"  among a great variety of musical instruments v This is literally from the French original v  In the meantime we may observe what indeed has been already implied that a strict intercourse was upheld between Cornwall and Wales Their languages customs and alliances as I have hinted were the same and they were separated only by a strait of inconsiderable breadth Cornwall is frequently styled WestWales by the British writers At the invasion of the Saxons both countries became indiscriminately the receptacle of the fugitive Britons We find the Welsh and Cornish as one people often uniting themselves as in a national cause against the Saxons They were frequently subject to the same prince

rocks rivers and caves of both nations are alike at this day distinguished by some noble atchievement at least by the name of that celebrated champion But to return  About the year Gualter archdeacon of Oxford a learned man and a diligent collector of histories travelling through France procured in Armorica an antient chronicle written in the British or Armorican language entitled BRUTYBRENHINED or THE HISTORY OF THE KINGS OF BRITAIN  In the curious library of the family of Davies at Llanerk in Denbighshire there is a copy of this chronicle in the handwriting of Guttyn Owen a celebrated Welsh bard and antiquarian about the year who ascribes it to Tyssilio a bishop and the son of BrockmaelYscythroc prince of Powis Tyssilio indeed wrote a HISTORY OF BRITAIN but that work as we are assured by Lhuyd in the ARCHAEOLOGIA was entirely ecclesiastical and has been long since lost  This book he brought into England and communicated it to Geoffrey of Monmouth a Welsh Benedictine monk an elegant writer of Latin and admirably skilled in the British tongue Geoffrey at the request and recommendation of Gualter the archdeacon translated this British chronicle into Latin  See Galfr Mon L i c xii ix Bale ii Thompson's Pref to Geoffrey's Hist Transl edit Lond p xxx xvi  executing the translation with a tolerable degree of purity and great fidelity yet not without  some interpolations  Geoffrey confesses that he took some part of his account of king Arthur's atchievements from the mouth of his friend Gualter the archdeacon who probably related to the translator some of the traditions on this subject which he had heard in Armorica or which at that time might have been popular in Wales Hist Brit Galfr Mon lib xi c i He also owns that Merlin's prophecies were not in the Armorican original Ib vii Compare Thompson's Pref ut supr p xxv xxvii The speeches and letters were forged by Geoffrey and in the description of battles our translator has not scrupled frequent variations and additions  I am obliged to an ingenious antiquarian in British literature Mr Morris of Penbryn for the following curious remarks concerning Geoffrey's original and his translation  "Geoffrey's SYLVIUS in the British original is SILIUS which in Latin would make JULIUS This illustrates and confirms Lambarde's BRUTUS JULIUS Peramb Kent p So also in the British bards And hence Milton's objection is removed Hist Engl p There are no FLAMINES or ARCHFLAMINES in the British book See Usher's Primord p Dubl edit There are very few speeches in the original and those very short Geoffrey's FULGENIUS is in the British copy SULIEN which by analogy in Latin would be JULIANUS See Milton's Hist Eng p There is no LEIL in the British that king's name was LLEON Geoffrey's CAERLISLE is in the British CAERLLEON or WestChester In the British LLAW AP CYNFARCH should have been translated LEO which is now rendered LOTH This has brought much confusion into the old Scotch history I find no BELINUS in the British copy the name is BELI which should have been in Latin BELIUS or BELGIUS Geoffrey's BRENNUS in the original is BRAN a common name among the Britons as BRAN AP DYFNWAL c See Suida's  It appears by the original that the British name of CARAUSIUS was CARAWN hence TREGARAUN i e TREGARON and the river CARAUN which gives name to ABERCORN In the British there is no division into books and chapters a mark of antiquity Those whom the translator calls CONSULS of Rome when Brennus took it are in the original TWYSOGION i e princes or generals The Gwalenses GWALO or GWALAS are added by Geoffrey B xii c "  To what is here observed about SILIUS I will add that abbot Whethamsted in his MS GRANARIUM mentions SILOIUS the father of Brutus  "Quomodo Brutus SILOII filius ad litora Angliae venit" c  GRANAR Part i Lit A MSS Cotton NERO C vi Brit Mus  This gentleman has in his possession a very antient manuscript of the original and has been many years preparing materials for giving an accurate and faithful translation of it into English The manuscript in Jesus college library at Oxford which Wynne pretends to be the same which Geoffrey himself made use of is evidently not older than the sixteenth century Mr Price the Bodleian librarian to whose friendship this work is much indebted has two copies lately given him by Mr Banks much more antient and perfect But there is reason to suspect that most of the British manuscripts of this history are translations from Geoffrey's Latin for  Britannia  they have BRYTTAEN which in the original would have been PRYDAIN Geoffrey's translation and for obvious reasons is a very common manuscript Compare Lhuyd's Arch p  It was probably finished after the year  Thompson says ubi supr p xxx Geoffrey's age is ascertained beyond a doubt even if other proofs were wanting from the cotemporaries whom he mentions Such as Robert earl of Glocester natural son of Henry the first and Alexander bishop of Lincoln his patrons he mentions also William of Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon Wharton places Geoffrey's death in the year Episc Assav p Robert de Monte who continued Sigebert's chronicle down to the year in the preface to that work expresly says that he took some of the materials of his supplement from the HISTORIA BRITONUM  lately translated out of British into Latin  This was manifestly Geoffrey's book Alfred of Beverly who evidently wrote his ANNALES published by Hearne between the years and borrowed his account of the British kings from Geoffrey's HISTORIA whose words he sometimes literally transcribes For instance Alfred in speaking of Arthur's keeping Whitsuntide at Caerleon says that the HISTORIA BRITONUM enumerated all the kings who came thither on Arthur's invitation and then adds  "Praeter hos non remansit princeps alicujus pretii citra Hispaniam qui ad istud edictum non venerit"  Alured Bev Annal p edit Hearne  These are Geoffrey's own words and so much his own that they are one of his additions to the British original But the curious reader who desires a complete and critical discussion of this point may consult an original letter of bishop Lloyd preserved among Tanner's manuscripts at Oxford num    It is difficult to ascertain exactly the period at which our translator's original romance may probably be supposed to have been compiled Yet this is a curious speculation and will illustrate our argument I am inclined to think that the work consists of fables thrown out by different rhapsodists at different times which afterwards were collected and digested into an entire history and perhaps with new decorations of fancy added by the compiler who most probably was one of the professed bards or rather a poetical historian of Armorica or Basse Bretagne In this state and under this form I suppose it to have fallen into the hands of Geoffrey of Monmouth If the hypothesis hereafter advanced concerning the particular species of fiction on which this narrative is founded should be granted it cannot from what I have already proved be more antient than the eighth century and we may reasonably conclude that it was composed much later as some considerable length of time must have been necessary for the propagation and establishment of that species of fiction The simple subject of this chronicle divested of its romantic embellishments is a deduction of the Welsh princes from the Trojan Brutus to Cadwallader who reigned in the seventh century  This notion of their extraction from the Trojans had so infatuated the Welsh that even so late as the year archbishop Peckham in his injunctions to the diocese of St Asaph orders the people to abstain from giving credit to idle dreams and visions a superstition which they had contracted from their belief in thedream of their founder Brutus in the temple of Diana concerning his arrival in Britain The archbishop very seriously advises them to boast no more of their relation to the conquered and fugitive Trojans but to glory in the victorious cross of Christ Concil Wilkins tom ii p edit fol  It must  be acknowledged that many European nations were antiently fond of tracing their descent from Troy Hunnibaldus Francus in his Latin history of France written in the sixth century beginning with the Trojan war and ending with Clovis the first ascribes the origin of the French nation to Francio a son of Priam  It is among the SCRIPTORES RER GERMAN Sim Schard tom i p edit Basil fol It consists of eighteen books  So universal was this humour and carried to such an absurd excess of extravagance that under the reign of Justinian even the Greeks were ambitious of being thought to be descended from the Trojans their antient and notorious enemies Unless we adopt the idea of those antiquaries who contend that Europe was peopled from Phrygia it will be hard to discover at what period or from what source so strange and improbable a notion could take its rise especially among nations unacquainted with history and overwhelmed in ignorance The most rational mode of accounting for it is to suppose that the revival of Virgil's Eneid about the sixth or seventh century which represented the Trojans as the founders of Rome the capital of the supreme pontiff and a city on various other accounts in the early ages of christianity highly reverenced and distinguished occasioned an emulation in many other European nations of claiming an alliance to the same respectable original The monks and other ecclesiastics the only readers and writers of the age were likely to broach and were interested in propagating such an opinion As the more barbarous countries of Europe began to be tinctured with literature there was hardly one of them but fell into the fashion of deducing its original from some of the nations most celebrated in the antient books Those who did not aspire so  high as king Priam or who found that claim preoccupied boasted to be descended from some of the generals of Alexander the Great from Prusias king of Bithynia from the Greeks or the Egyptians It it not in the mean time quite improbable that as most of the European nations were provincial to the Romans those who fancied themselves to be of Trojan extraction might have imbibed this notion at least have acquired a general knowledge of the Trojan story from their conquerors more especially the Britons who continued so long under the yoke of Rome  See infr SECT iii p  But as to the story of Brutus in particular Geoffrey's hero it may be presumed that his legend was not contrived nor the history of his successors invented till after the ninth century for Nennius who lived about the middle of that century not only speaks of Brutus with great obscurity and inconsistency but seems totally uninformed as to every circumstance of the British affairs which preceded Cesar's invasion There are other proofs that this piece could not have existed before the ninth century Alfred's Saxon translation of the Mercian law is mentioned  L iii c  Charlemagne's Twelve Peers and by an anachronism not uncommon in romance are said to be present at king Arthur's magnificent coronation in the city of Caerleon  L ix c  It were easy to produce instances that this chronicle was undoubtedly framed after the legend of saint Ursula the acts of saint Lucius and the historical writings of the venerable Bede had undergone some degree of circulation in the world At the same time it contains many passages which incline us to determine that some parts of it at least were written after or about the eleventh century I will not insist on that passage in which the title of legate of the apostolic see is attributed to Dubricius in the character of primate of Britain as it appears for obvious reasons to have been an artful interpolation of the translator who was an ecclesiastic But I will select other arguments Canute's forest or Cannockwood  in Staffordshire occurs and Canute died in the year  L vii c  At the ideal coronation of king Arthur just mentioned a tournament is described as exhibited in its highest splendor  "Many knights says our Armoric fabler famous for feats of chivalry were present with apparel and arms of the same colour and fashion They formed a species of diversion in imitation of a fight on horseback and the ladies being placed on the walls of the castles darted amorous glances on the combatants None of these ladies esteemed any knight worthy of her love but such as had given proof of his gallantry in three several encounters Thus the valour of the men encouraged chastity in the women and the attention of the women proved an incentive to the soldier's bravery  L ix c  "  Here is the practice of chivalry under the combined ideas of love and military prowess as they seem to have subsisted after the feudal constitution had acquired greater degrees not only of stability but of splendor and refinement  Pitts mentions an anonymous writer under the name of EREMITA BRITANNUS who studied history and astronomy and flourished about the year He wrote besides a book in an unknown language entitled  Sanchem Graal De Rege Arthuro et rebus gestis ejus  Lib i  De Mensa rotunda et  STRENUIS EQUITIBUS lib i See Pits p Bale x Usser Primord p This subject could not have been treated by so early a writer  And although a species of tournament was exhibited in France at the reconciliation of the sons of Lewis the feeble in the close of the ninth century and at the beginning of the tenth the coronation of the emperor Henry was solemnized with martial entertainments in which many parties were introduced fighting on horseback yet it was long afterwards that these games were accompanied with the peculiar formalities and ceremonious usages here described  See infr SECT iii p xii p I will here produce from that learned orientalist M D'Herbelot some curious traites of Arabian knighterrantry which the reader may apply to the principles of this Dissertation as he pleases  "BATTHALLUne homme hardi et vaillant qui  cherchè des avantures  tels qu' etoient les  chevaliers errans  de nos anciens Romans"  He adds that Batthall an Arabian who lived about the year of Christ was a warrior of this class concerning whom many marvellous feats of arms are reported that his life was written in a large volume  "mais qu'elle est toute remplie d'  exaggerations  et de  menteries  "  Bibl

innovations of a translator in such a description The burial of Hengist the Saxon chief who is said to have been interred not after the  pagan  fashion as Geoffrey renders the words of the original but after the  manner of the  SOLDANS is partly an argument that our romance was composed about the time of the crusades It was not till those memorable campaigns of mistaken devotion had infatuated the western world that the soldans or sultans of Babylon of Egypt of Iconium and other eastern kingdoms became familiar in Europe Not that the notion of this piece being written so late as the crusades in the least invalidates the doctrine delivered in this discourse Not even if we suppose that Geoffrey of Monmouth was its original composer That notion rather tends to confirm and establish my system On the whole we may venture to affirm that this chronicle supposed to contain the ideas of the Welsh bards entirely consists of Arabian inventions And in this view no difference is made whether it was compiled about the tenth century at which time if not before the Arabians from their settlement in Spain must have communicated their romantic fables to other parts of Europe especially to the French or whether it first appeared in the eleventh century after the crusades had multiplied these fables to an excessive degree and made them universally popular And although the general cast of the inventions contained in this romance is alone sufficient to point out the source from whence they were derived yet I chuse to prove to a demonstration what is here advanced by producing and examining some particular passages  The books of the Arabians and Persians abound with extravagant traditions about the giants Gog and Magog These they call Jagiouge and Magiouge and the Caucasian wall  said to be built by Alexander the Great from the Caspian to the Black Sea in order to cover the frontiers of his dominion and to prevent the incursions of the Sythians  Compare M Petis de la Croix Hist Genghizcan l iv c p  is called by the orientals the WALL of GOG and MAGOG  Herbelot Bibl Oriental p c They call Tartary the land of Gajiouge and Majiouge This wall some few fragments of which still remain they pretend to have been built with all sorts of metals See Abulfaraj Hist Dynast edit Pococke p A D It was an old tradition among the Tartars that the people of Jajgioue and Majiouge were perpetually endeavouring to make a passage through this fortress but that they would not succeed in their attempt till the day of judgment See Hist Geneal des Tartars d'Abulgazi Bahadut Khân p About the year the caliph Al Amin having heard wonderful reports concerning this wall or barrier sent his interpreter Salam with a guard of fifty men to view it After a dangerous journey of near two months Salam and his party arrived in a desolated country where they beheld the ruins of many cities destroyed by the people of Jajiouge and Majiouge In six days more they reached the castles near the mountain Kokaiya or Caucasus This mountain is inaccessibly steep perpetually covered with snows and thick clouds and encompasses the country of Jagiouge and Magiouge which is full of cultivated fields and cities At an opening of thi  mountain the fortress appears and trave ling forwards at the distance of two stages they found another mountain with a ditch cut through it one hundred and fifty cubits wide and within the aperture an iron gate fifty cubits high supported by vast buttresses having an iron bulwark crowned with iron turrets reaching to the summit of the mountain itself which is too high to be seen The valves lintels threshold bolts lock and key are all represented of proportionable magnitude The governor of the castle abovementioned once in every week mounted on horseback with ten others on horseback comes to this gate and striking it three times with a hammer weighing five pounds and then listening hears a murmuring noise from within This noise is supposed to proceed from the Jagiouge and Magiouge confined there Salam was told that they often appeared on the battlements of the bulwark He returned after passing twentyeight months in

and shells which compose a substance of great solidity It has been chiefly destroyed by the neighbouring inhabitants for the sake of its materials and most of the adjacent towns and villages are built

history of the eastern nations will perhaps be found to begin with the exploits of this Grecian hero  One of the most formidable giants according to our Armorican romance  which opposed the landing of Brutus in Britain was Goemagot He was twelve cubits high and would unroot an oak as easily as an hazel wand but after a most obstinate encounter with Corineus he was tumbled into the sea from the summit of a steep cliff on the rocky shores of Cornwall and dashed in pieces against the huge crags of the declivity The place where he fell adds our historian taking its name from the giant's fall is called LAMGOEMAGOT or GOEMAGOT'S LEAP to this day  Lib i c  A no less monstrous giant whom king Arthur slew on Saint Michael's Mount in Cornwall is said by this fabler to have come from Spain Here the origin of these stories is evidently betrayed  L x c  The Arabians or Saracens as I have hinted above had conquered Spain and were settled there Arthur having killed this redoubted giant declares that he had combated with none of equal strength and prowess since he overcame the mighty giant Ritho on the mountain Arabius who had made himself a robe of the beards of the kings whom he had killed This tale is in Spenser's Faerie Queene A magician brought from Spain is called to the assistance of Edwin a prince of Northumberland  The Cumbrian and Northumbrian Britons as powerful opponents of the Saxons were strongly allied to the Welsh and Cornish  educated under Solomon king of the Armoricans  Lib xii c  In the prophecy of Merlin delivered to Vortigern after the battle of the dragons forged perhaps by the translator Geoffrey yet apparently in the spirit and manner of the rest we have the Arabians named and their situations in Spain and Africa  "From Conau shall come forth a wild boar whose tusks shall destroy the oaks of the forests of France The ARABIANS and AFRICANS shall dread him and he shall continue his rapid course into the most distant parts of Spain  Lib vii c  "  This is king Arthur In the same prophecy mention is made of the  "Woods of  Africa"  In another place Gormund king of the Africans occurs  Lib xii xi  In a battle which Arthur fights against the Romans some of the principal leaders in the Roman army are Alifantinam king of Spain Pandrasus king of Egypt Boccus king of the Medes Evander king of Syria Micipsa king of Babylon and a duke of Phrygia  Lib x c  It is obvious to suppose how these countries became so familiar to the bard of our chronicle The old fictions about Stonehenge were derived from the same inexhaustible source of extravagant imagination We are told in this romance that the giants conveyed the stones which compose this miraculous monument from the farthest coasts of Africa Every one of these stones is supposed to be mystical and to contain a medicinal virtue an idea drawn from the medical skill of the Arabians  See infr SECT i p And SECT xiii p infr  and more particularly from the Arabian doctrine of attributing healing qualities and other occult properties to stones  This chronicle was evidently compiled to do honour to the Britons and their affairs and especially in opposition to the Saxons Now the importance with which these romancers seem to speak of Stonehenge and the many beautiful fictions with which they have been so studious to embellish its origin and to aggrandise its history appear to me strongly to favour the hypothesis that Stonehenge is a British monument and indeed to prove that it was really erected in memory of the three hundred British nobles massacred by the Saxon Hengist See SECT ii infr p No DRUIDICAL monument of which so many remains were common engaged their attention or interested them so much as this NATIONAL memorial appears to have done  Merlin's transformation of Uther into Gorlois and of Ulfin into Bricel by the power of some medical preparation is a species of Arabian magic which professed to work the most wonderful deceptions of this kind and is mentioned at large hereafter in tracing the inventions of Chaucer's poetry The attribution of prophetical language to birds was common among the orientals and an eagle is supposed to speak at building the walls of the city of Paladur now Shaftesbury  Lib ii c See SECT inf xv p  The Arabians cultivated the study of philosophy  particularly astronomy with amazing ardour  See DISS ii And SECT xv inf p  Hence arose the tradition reported by our historian that in king Arthur's reign there subsisted at Caerleon in Glamorganshire a college of two hundred philosophers who studied astronomy and other sciences and who were particularly employed in watching the courses of the stars and predicting events to the king from their observations  Lib ix c  Edwin's Spanish magician abovementioned by his knowledge of the flight of birds and the courses of the stars is said to foretell future disasters In the same strain Merlin prognosticates Uther's success in battle by the appearance of a comet  L viii c  The same enchanter's  wonderful skill in mechanical powers  by which he removes the giant's Dance or Stonehenge from Ireland into England and the notion that this stupendous structure was raised by a PROFOUND PHILOSOPHICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE MECHANICAL ARTS are founded on the Arabic literature  L viii c See infr SECT xv passim  To which we may add king Bladud's magical operations  L ii  Dragons are a sure mark of orientalism One of these in our romance is a  "terrible dragon flying from the west breathing fire and illuminating all the country with the brightness of his eyes  L x c  "  In another place we have a giant mounted on a winged dragon the dragon erects his scaly tail and wafts his rider to the clouds with great rapidity  L vii c    Arthur and Charlemagne are the first and original heroes of romance And as Geoffrey's history is the grand repository of the acts of Arthur so a fabulous history ascribed to Turpin is the ground work of all the chimerical legends which have been related concerning the conquests of Charlemagne and his twelve peers Its subject is the expulsion of the Saracens  from Spain and it is filled with fictions evidently cogenial with those which characterise Geoffrey's history  I will mention only one among many others The christians under Charlemagne are said to have found in Spain a golden idol or image of Mahomet as high as a bird can fly It was framed by Mahomet himself of the purest metal who by his knowledge in necromancy had sealed up within it a legion of diabolical spirits It held in its hand a prodigious club and the Saracens had a prophetic tradition that this club should fall from the hand of the image in that year when a certain king should be born in France c J Turpini Hist de Vit Carol Magn et Rolandi cap iv f a    Some suppose as I have hinted above this romance to have been written by Turpin a monk of the eighth century who for his knowledge of the Latin language his sanctity and gallant exploits against the Spanish Saracens was preferred to the archbishoprick of Rheims by Charlemagne Others believe it to have been forged under archbishop Turpin's name about that time Others very soon afterwards in the reign of Charles the Bald  See Hist Acad des Inscript c vii edit to  That is about the year  See Catel Mem de l'Hist du Languedoc pag    Voltaire a writer of much deeper research than is imagined and the first who has displayed the literature and customs of the dark ages with any degree of penetration and comprehension speaking of the fictitious tales concerning Charlemagne has remarked  "Ces fables qu'un moine ecrivit au onzieme siecle sous le nom de l'archeveque Turpin  "Hist Gen ch viii Oeuvr tom i p edit Genev  "  And it might easily be shewn that just before the commencement of the thirteenth century romantic stories about Charlemagne were more fashionable than ever among the French minstrels That is on the recent publication of this fabulous history of Charlemagne Historical evidence concurs with numerous internal arguments to prove that it must have been compiled after the crusades In the twentieth chapter a pretended pilgrimage of Charlemagne to the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem is recorded a forgery  seemingly contrived with a design to give an importance to those wild expeditions and which would easily be believed when thus authenticated by an archbishop  See infr SECT iii p    There is another strong internal proof that this romance was written long after the time of Charlemagne Our historian is speaking of the numerous chiefs and kings who came with their armies to assist his hero among the rest he mentions earl Oell and adds  "Of this man there is a song commonly sung among the minstrels  even to this day  "De hoc canitur in Cantilena  sque  ad hodiernum diem  "  cap xi f b edit Schard Francof fol Chronograph Quat  "  Nor will I believe that the European art of war in the eighth century could bring into the field such a prodigious parade of battering rams and wooden castles as those with which Charlemagne is said to have besieged the city Agennum  Ibid cap ix f b The writer adds  "Caeterisque  artificiis ad capiendum  c"  See also cap x ibid Compare SECT iv infr p In one of Charlemagne's battles the Saracens advance with horrible visors bearded and horned and with drums or cymbals  "Tenentesque singuli TYMPAN  quae manibus fortiter percutiebant"  The unusual spectacle and sound terrified the horses of the christian army and threw them into confusion In a second engagement Charlemagne commanded the eyes of the horses to be covered and their ears to be stopped Turpin cap xviii f b The latter expedient is copied in the Romance of RICHARD THE FIRST written about the eleventh century See SECT iv infr p See also what is said of the Saracen drums ibid p  the crusades seem to have made these huge military machines common in the European armies However we may suspect it appeared before yet not long before Geoffrey's romance who mentions Charlemagne's TWELVE PEERS so lavishly celebrated in Turpin's book as present at king Arthur's imaginary coronation at Caerleon Although the twelve peers of France occur in chronicles of the tenth century  Flodoard of Rheims first mentions them whose chronicle comes down to  and they might besides have been suggested to Geoffrey's original author from popular traditions and songs of minstrels We are sure it was extant before the year for Calixtus the second in that year by papal  authority pronounced this history to be genuine  Magn Chron Belgic pag sub ann Compare J Long Bibl Hist Gall num And Lambec ii p  Monsieur Allard affirms that it was written and in the eleventh century at Vienna by a monk of Saint Andrew's  Bibl de Dauphiné p  This monk was probably nothing more than some Latin translator but a learned French antiquary is of opinion that it was originally composed in Latin and moreover that the most antient romances even those of the Round Table were originally written in that language  See infr SECT viii p  Oienhart and with the greatest probability supposes it to be the work of a Spaniard He quotes an authentic manuscript to prove that it was brought out of Spain into France before the close of the twelfth century  See infr SECT iii p  and that the miraculous exploits performed in Spain by Charlemagne and earl Roland recorded in this romantic history were unknown among the French before that period except only that some few of them were obscurely and imperfectly sketched in the metrical tales of those who sung heroic adventures  Arnoldi Oienharti Notit utriusque Vasconiae edit Paris to pag lib iii c Such was Roland's song sung at the battle of Hastings But see this romance cap xx f b Where Turpin seems to refer to some other fabulous materials or history concerning Charlemagne Particularly about Galafar and Braiamant which make such a figure in Boyardo and Ariosto  Oienhart's supposition that this history was compiled in Spain the centre of oriental fabling in Europe at once accounts for the nature and extravagance of its fictions and immediately points to their Arabian origin  Innumerable romantic stories of Arabian growth are to this day current among the common people of Spain which they call CUJENTOS DE VIEJAS I will relate one from that lively picture of the Spaniards RELATION DU VOYAGE D'ESPAGNE by Madamoiselle Danois Within the antient castle of Toledo they say there was a vast cavern whose entrance was strongly barricadoed It was universally believed that if any person entered this cavern the most fatal disasters would happen to the Spaniards Thus it remained closely shut and unentered for many ages At length king Roderigo having less credulity but more courage and curiosity than his ancestors commanded this formidable recess to be opened At entering he began to suspect the traditions of the people to be true a terrible tempest arose and all the elements seemed united to embarrass him Nevertheless he ventured forwards into the cave where he discerned by the light of his torches certain figures on statues of men whose habiliments and arms were strange and uncouth One of them had a sword of shining brass on which it was written in Arabic characters that the time approached when the Spanish nation should be destroyed and that it would not be long before the warriors whose images were placed there should arrive in Spain The writer adds  "Je n'ai jamais été en aucun endroit où l'on fasse PLUS DE CAS des CONTES FABULEUX qu'en Espagne"  Edit a la Haye tom iii p mo  See

there was a great impropriety in translating Latin prose into verse we may conclude that at the commencement of the thirteenth century the French generally made their translations into verse  In these two fabulous chronicles the foundations of romance seem to be laid The principal characters the leading subjects and the fundamental fictions which have supplied such ample matter to this singular species of composition are here first displayed And although the long continuance of the crusades imported innumerable inventions of a similar complexion and substituted the atchievements of new champions and the wonders of other countries yet the tales of Arthur and of Charlemagne diversified indeed or enlarged with additional embellishments still continued to prevail and to be the favourite topics and this partly from their early popularity partly from the quantity and the beauty of the fictions with which they were at first supported and especially because the design of the crusades had made those subjects so fashionable in which christians fought with infidels In a word these volumes are the first specimens  extant in this mode of writing No European history before these has mentioned giants enchanters dragons and the like monstrous and arbitrary fictions And the reason is obvious they were written at a time when a new and unnatural mode of thinking took place in Europe introduced by our communication with the east  Hitherto I have considered the Saracens either at their immigration into Spain about the ninth century or at the time of the crusades as the first authors of romantic fabling among the Europeans But a late ingenious critic has advanced an hypothesis which assigns a new source and a much earlier date to these fictions I will cite his opinion of this matter in his own words  "Our old romances of chivalry may be derived in a LINEAL DESCENT from the antient historical songs of the Gothic bards and scaldsMany of those songs are still preserved in the north which exhibit all the seeds of chivalry before it became a solemn institutionEven the common arbitrary fictions of romance were most of them familiar to the antient scalds of the north long before the time of the crusades They believed the existence of giants and dwarfs they had some notion of fairies they were strongly possessed with the belief of spells and inchantment and were fond of inventing combats with dragons and monsters  Percy on ANTIENT METR ROM i p edit  "  Monsieur Mallet a very able and elegant inquirer into the genius and antiquities of the northern nations mantains the same doctrine He seems to think that many of the opinions and practices of the Goths however obsolete still obscurely subsist He adds  "May we not rank among these for example that love and admiration for the profession of arms which prevailed among our ancestors even to fanaticism and as it were through system and brave from a point of honour  Can we not explain from the Gothic religion how judiciary combats and proofs by the ordeal to the astonishment of posterity were admitted by the legislature of all Europe  For the judiciary combats as also for common athletic exercises they formed an amphitheatrical circus of rude stones  "Quaedam saxa CIRCOS claudebant in quibus gigantes et pugiles DUELLO strenue decertabant"  Worm p  And again  "Nec mora CIRCUATUR campus milite CIRCUS stipatur concurrunt pugiles"  p  It is remarkable that circs of the same sort are still to be seen in Cornwall so famous at this day for the athletic art in which also they sometimes exhibited their scriptural interludes See infr SECT vi p Frotho the Great king of Denmark in the first century is said to have been the first who commanded all controversies to be decided by the sword Worm p In favour of this barbarous institution it ought to be remembered that the practice of thus marking out the place of battle must have prevented much bloodshed and saved many innocent lives for if either combatant was by any accident forced out of the circus he was to lose his cause or to pay three marks of pure silver as a redemption for his life Worm p In the year the ordeal was substituted in Denmark instead of the duel a mode of decision at least in a political sense less absurd as it promoted military skill  and how even to the present age the people are still infatuated with a belief of the power of magicians witches spirits and genii concealed under the earth or in the watersDo we not discover in these religious opinions that source of the marvellous with which our ancestors filled their romances in which we see dwarfs and giants fairies and demons" c  Mallet Introduction a l' Histoire de Dannemarc c tom ii p    And in another place  "The fortresses of the Goths were only rude castles situated on the summits of rocks and rendered inaccessible by thick misshapen walls As these walls ran winding round the castles they often called them by a name which signified SERPENTS or DRAGONS and in these they usually secured the women and young virgins of distinction who were seldom safe at a time when so many enterprising heroes were rambling up and down in search of adventures It was this custom which gave occasion to antient romancers who knew not how to describe any thing simply to invent so many fables concerning princesses of great beauty guarded by dragons and afterwards delivered by invincible champions  Ib ch ix p tom ii    I do not mean entirely to reject this hypothesis but I will endeavour to shew how far I think it is true and in what manner or degree

render those who bore it in battle invulnerable Apud Hickes Thesaur Dissertat Epistol p  Various other instances might here  be added some of which will occasionally arise in the future course of our inquiries  It is notorious that many traces of oriental usages are found amongst all the European nations during their pagan state and this phenomenon is rationally resolved on the supposition that all Europe was originally peopled from the east But as the resemblance which the pagan Scandinavians bore to the eastern nations in manners monuments opinions and practices is so very perceptible and apparent an inference arises that their migration from the east must have happened at a period by many ages more recent and therefore most probably about the time specified by their historians In the mean time we must remember that a distinction is to be made between this expedition of Odin's Goths who formed a settlement in Scandinavia and those innumerable armies of barbarous adventurers who some centuries afterwards distinguished by the same name at different periods overwhelmed Europe and at length extinguished the Roman empire  When we consider the rapid conquests of the nations which may be comprehended under the common name of Scythians and not only those conducted by Odin but by Attila Theodoric and Genseric we cannot ascribe such successes to brutal courage only To say that some of these irresistible conquerors made war on a luxurious effeminate and enervated people is a plausible and easy mode of accounting for their conquests but this reason will not operate with equal force in the histories of Genghizcan and  Tamerlane who destroyed mighty empires founded on arms and military discipline and who baffled the efforts of the ablest leaders Their science and genius in war such as it then was cannot therefore be doubted that they were not deficient in the arts of peace I have already hinted and now proceed to produce more particular proofs Innumerable and very fundamental errors have crept into our reasonings and systems about savage life resulting merely from those strong and undistinguishing notions of barbarism which our prejudices have hastily formed concerning the character of all rude nations  See this argument pursued in the following DISSERTATION    Among other arts which Odin's Goths planted in Scandinavia their skill in poetry to which they were addicted in a peculiar manner and which they cultivated with a wonderful enthusiasm seems to be most worthy our regard and especially in our present inquiry  As the principal heroes of their expedition into the north were honourably distinguished from the Europeans or original Scandinavians under the name of Asae or Asiatics so the verses or language of this people were denominated ASAMAL or ASIATIC speech  "Linguam Danicam antiquam cujus in rythmis usus fuit veteres appellarunt ASAMAL id est Asiaticam vel ASARUM SERMONEM quod eum ex Asia Odinus secum in Daniam Norwegiam Sueciam aliasque regiones septentrionales invexerit"  Steph Stephan Praefat ad Saxon Grammat Hist  Their poetry contained not only the praises of their heroes but their popular traditions and their religious rites and was filled with those fictions which the most exaggerated pagan superstition would naturally implant in the wild imaginations of an Asiatic people And from this principle alone I mean of their Asiatic origin some critics would at once account for a certain capricious spirit of extravagance and those bold eccentric conceptions which so strongly distinguish the old northern poetry  A most ingenious critic observes that  "what we have been long accustomed to call the ORIENTAL VEIN of poetry because some of the EARLIEST poetical productions have come to us from the east is probably no more ORIENTAL than OCCIDENTAL"  Blair's Crit Diss on Ossian vol ii p  But all the LATER oriental writers through all ages have been particularly distinguished for this VEIN Hence it is here characteristical of a country not of an age I will allow on this writer's very just and penetrating principles that an early northern ode shall be as sublime as an eastern one Yet the sublimity of the latter shall have a different character it will be more inflated and gigantic  Nor  is this fantastic imagery the only mark of Asiaticism which appears in the Runic odes They have a certain sublime and figurative cast of diction which is indeed one of their predominant characteristics  Thus a Rainbow is called  the bridge of the gods  Poetry  the mead of Odin  The earth  the vessel that floats on ages  A ship  the horse of the waves  Ice  the vast bridge  Herbs  the fleece of the earth  A Battle  a bath of blood the hail of Odin the shock of bucklers  A Tongue  the sword of words  Night  the veil of cares  Rocks  the bones of the earth  Arrows  the hailst  nes of  elmets c c  I am very sensible that all rude nations are naturally apt to cloath their sentiments in this style A propensity to this mode of expression is necessarily occasioned by the poverty of their language which obliges them frequently to substitute similitudes and circumlocutions it arises in great measure from feelings undisguised and unrestrained by custom or art and from the genuine efforts of nature working more at large in uncultivated minds In the infancy of society the passions and the imagination are alike uncontrouled But another cause seems to have concurred in producing the effect here mentioned When obvious terms and phrases evidently occurred the Runic poets are fond of departing from the common and established diction They appear to use circumlocution and comparisons not as a matter of necessity but of choice and skill nor are these metaphorical colourings so much the result of want of words as of warmth of fancy  In a strict geographical sense the original country of these Asiatic Goths might not be so situated as physically to have produced these effects Yet it is to be observed that intercourse and vicinity are in this case sometimes equivalent to climate The Persian traditions and superstitions were current even in the northern parts of Tartary Georgia however may be fairly considered as a part of Persia It is equal in fertility to any of the eastern Turkish provinces in Asia It affords the richest wines and other luxuries of life in the greatest abundance The most beautiful virgins for the seraglio are fetched from this province In the mean time thus much at least may be said of a warm climate exclusive of its supposed immediate physical influence on the human mind and temperament It exhibits all the productions of nature in their highest perfection and beauty while the excessive heat of the sun and the fewer incitements to labour and industry dispose the inhabitants to indolence and to living much abroad in scenes of nature These circumstances are favourable to the operations of fancy    Their warmth of fancy however if supposed to have proceeded from the principles above suggested in a few generations after this migration into Scandinavia must have lost much of its natural heat and genuine force Yet ideas and sentiments especially of this sort once imbibed are long remembered and retained in savage life Their religion among other causes might have contributed to keep this spirit alive and to preserve their original stock of images and native mode of expression unchanged and unabated by climate or country In the mean time we may suppose that the new situation of these people in Scandinavia might have added a darker shade and a more savage complexion to their former fictions and superstitions and that the formidable objects of nature to which they became familiarised in those northern solitudes the piny precipices the frozen mountains and the gloomy forests acted on their imaginations and gave a tincture of horror to their imagery  A skill in poetry seems in some measure to have been a national science among the Scandinavians and to have been familiar to almost every order and degree Their kings and warriors partook of this epidemic enthusiasm and on frequent occasions are represented as breaking forth into spontaneous songs and verses  Harold Hardraade king of Norway composed sixteen songs of his expedition into Africa Asbiorn Pruda a Danish champion described his past life in nine strophes while his enemy Bruce a giant was tearing out his bowels  "i  Tell my mother Suanhita in Denmark that she will not this summer comb the hair of her son I had promised her to return but now my side shall feel the edge of the sword  ii It was far otherwise  when we sate at home in mirth chearing ourselves with the drink of ale and coming from Hordeland passed the gulf in our ships when we quaffed mead and conversed of liberty Now I alone am fallen into the narrow prisons of the giants  iii It was far otherwise c"  Every stanza is introduced with the same choral burden Bartholin

digging for treasure Sax Grammat L p There are instances recorded of their speaking in metre on the most common occurrences  But the exercise of the poetical  talent was properly confined to a stated profession and with their poetry the Goths imported into Europe a species of poets or singers whom they called SCALDS or POLISHERS of LANGUAGE This order of men as we shall see more distinctly below was held in the highest honour and veneration they received the most liberal rewards for their verses attended the festivals of heroic chiefs accompanied them in battle and celebrated their victories  The Sogdians were a people who lived eastward of the Caspian sea not far from the country of Odin's Goths Quintus Curtius relates that when some of that people were condemned to death by Alexander on account of a revolt they rejoiced greatly and testified their joy by SINGING VERSES and dancing When the king enquired the reason of their joy they answered  "that being soon to be RESTORED TO THEIR ANCESTORS by so great a conqueror they could not help celebrating so honourable a death which was the WISH of all brave men in their own ACCUSTOMED SONGS"  Lib vii c  I am obliged to doctor Percy for pointing out this passage From the correspondence of manners and principles it holds forth between the Scandinavians and the Sogdians it contains a striking proof of Odin's migration from the east to the north first in the spontaneous exercise of the poetical talent and secondly in the opinion that a glorious or warlike death which admitted them to the company of their friends and parents in another world was to be embraced with the most eager alacrity and the highest sensations of pleasure This is the doctrine of the Edda In the same spirit RIDENS MORIAR is the triumphant close of Regner Lodbrog's dying ode See Keysler ubi infr p I cannot help adding here another stroke from this ode which seems also to be founded on eastern manners He speaks with great rapture of drinking  "ex concavis crateribus craniorum"  The inhabitants of the island of Ceylon to this day carouse at their feasts from cups or bowls made of the sculls of their deceased ancestors Ives's VOYAGE TO INDIA ch

and entertained in other countries besides their own and by that means to have probably communicated their fictions to various parts of Europe I will give my reasons for this supposition  In the early ages of Europe before many regular governments took place revolutions emigrations and invasions were frequent and almost universal Nations were alternately  destroyed or formed and the want of political security exposed the inhabitants of every country to a state of eternal fluctuation That Britain was originally peopled from Gaul a nation of the Celts is allowed but that many colonies from the northern parts of Europe were afterwards successively planted in Britain and the neighbouring islands is an hypothesis equally rational and not altogether destitute of historical evidence Nor was any nation more likely than the Scandinavian Goths I mean in their early periods to make descents on Britain They possessed the spirit of adventure in an eminent degree They were habituated to dangerous enterprises They were acquainted with distant coasts exercised in navigation and fond of making expeditions in hopes of conquest and in search of new acquisitions As to Scotland and Ireland there is the highest probability that the Scutes who conquered both those countries and possessed them under the names of Albin Scutes and Irin Scutes were a people of Norway The Caledonians are expressly called by many judicious antiquaries a Scandinavian colony The names of places and persons over all that part of Scotland which the Picts inhabited are of Scandinavian extraction A simple catalogue of them only would immediately convince us that they are not of Celtic or British origin Flaherty reports it as a received opinion and a general doctrine that the Picts migrated into Britain and Ireland from Scandinavia  It is conjectured by Wormius that  Ireland  is derived from the Runic Yr a bow for the use of which the Irish were once famous Lit Run c xvii p The Asiatics near the lake

Stillingfleet's Orig Brit Praef p xxxviii  I forbear to accumulate a pedantic parade of authorities on this occasion nor can it be expected that I should enter into a formal and exact examination of this obscure and complicated  subject in its full extent which is here only introduced incidentally I will only add that Scotland and Ireland as being situated more to the north and probably less difficult of access than Britain might have been objects on which our northern adventurers were invited to try some of their earliest excursions and that the Orkneyislands remained long under the jurisdiction of the Norwegian potentates  In these expeditions the northern emigrants as we shall prove more particularly below were undoubtedly attended by their scalds or poets Yet even in times of peace and without the supposition of conquest or invasion the Scandinavian scalds might have been well known in the British islands Possessed of a specious and pleasing talent they frequented the courts of the British Scottish and Irish chieftains They were itinerants by their institution and made voyages out of curiosity or in quest of rewards to those islands or coasts which lay within the circle of their maritime knowledge By these means they established an interest rendered their profession popular propagated their art and circulated their fictions in other countries and at a distance from home Torfaeus asserts positively that various Islandic odes now remain which were sung by the Scandinavian bards before the kings of England and Ireland and for which they received liberal gratuities  Torf Hist Orcad in Praefat  They were more especially caressed and rewarded at the courts of those princes who were distinguished for their warlike character and their passion for military glory  Olaus Wormius informs us that great numbers of the northern scalds constantly resided in the courts of the kings of Sweden Denmark and England  Lit Dan p ed to  Hence the tradition in an antient Islandic Saga or poetical history may be explained which says that Odin's language was originally  used not only in Denmark Sweden and Norway but even in England  Bartholin iii p It was a constant old British tradition that king Arthur conquered Ireland Gothland Denmark and Norway See Galfrid Monum ix Rob of Glouc ed Hearne p What is said in the text must have greatly facilitated the Saxon and Danish conquests in England The works of the genuine Caedmon are written in the language of the antient Angles who were nearly connected with the Jutes Hence that language resembled the antient Danish as appears from passages of Caedmon cited by Wanley Hence also it happened that the later DanoSaxonic dialect in which Junius's POETICAL PARAPHRASE OF GENESIS was written is likewise so very similar to the language of the antient Angles who settled in the more northern parts of England And in this dialect which indeed prevailed in some degree almost over all England many other poems are composed mentioned likewise in Wanley's Catalogue It is the constant doctrine of the Danish historians that the Danes and Angles whose successors gave the name to this island had the same origin  Indeed it may be naturally concluded from these suggestions that the Scandinavian tongue became familiar in the British islands by the songs of the scalds unless it be rather presumed that a previous knowledge of that tongue in Britain was the means of facilitating the admission of those poets and preparing the way for their reception  And here it will be much to our present argument to observe that some of the old Gothic and Scandinavian superstitions are to this day retained in the English language MARA from whence our Nightmare is derived was in the Runic theology a spirit or spectre of the night which seized men in their sleep and suddenly deprived them of speech and motion  See Keysler Antiquitat Sel Septentrional p edit  NICKA was the Gothic demon who inhabited the element of

who succeeded to the Britons and became possessors of England in the sixth century may be justly presumed  "Ex vetustioribus poetis Cimbrorum nempe Scaldis et Theotiscae gentis versificatoribus plane

first of which lived in the reign of Athelstan and the latter as some suppose in that of Edgar both christian champions against the pagan Danes were originally subjects of the genuine Saxon bards But I rather think they begun to be celebrated in or after the crusades the nature of which expeditions dictated to the romancewriters and brought into vogue stories of christians fighting with infidel heroes The cause was the same and the circumstances partly parallel and this being once the fashion they consulted their own histories for heroes and combats were feigned with Danish giants as well as with the Saracen See infr SECT iii p There is the story of BEVIS in British YSTORI BOUN O HAMTUN Lhuyd's Arch Brit p  They suddenly became a mild and polished people addicted to the arts of peace and

discern the supposed sublimity of those mysterious dithyrambics which close the Saxon MENOLOGE or poetic calendar written about the tenth century printed by Hickes Gramm AngloSax p They seem to be prophesies and proverbs or rather splendid fragments from different poems thrown together without connection  Yet even in these pieces they have frequent allusions to the old scaldic fables and heroes Thus in an AngloSaxon poem on Judith Holofernes is  called BALDER or  leader and prince of warriors  And in a poetical paraphrase on Genesis Abimelech has the same appellation  See Hickes Thesaur i p Who adds many more instances  This Balder was a famous chieftain of the Asiatic Goths the son of Odin and supposed to inhabit a magnificent hall in the future place of rewards The same AngloSaxon paraphrast in his prosopopea of Satan addressing his companions plunged in the infernal abyss adopts many images and expressions used in the very sublime description of the Eddic hell  Fab xlix See Hickes ubi supr p  Henry of Huntingdon complains of certain  extraneous words  and  uncommon figures  of speech in a Saxon ode on a victory of king Athelstan  Who has greatly misrepresented the sense

its occasion In the year Anlaff a pagan king of the Hybernians and the adjacent isles invited by Constantine king of the Scots entered the river Abi or Humber with a strong fleet Our Saxon king Athelstan and his brother Eadmund Clito met them with a numerous army near a place called Brunenburgh and after a most obstinate and bloody resistance drove them back to their ships The battle lasted from daybreak till the evening On the side of Anlaff were slain six petty kings and seven chiefs or generals  "King Adelstan the glory of leaders the giver of gold chains to his nobles and his brother Eadmund both shining with the brightness of a long train of ancestors struck the adversary in war at Brunenburgh with the edge of the sword they clove the wall of shields The high banners fell The earls of the departed Edward fell for it was born within them even from the loins of their kindred to defend the treasures and the houses of their country and  their gifts against the hatred of strangers The nation of the Scots and the fatal inhabitants of ships fell The hills resounded and the armed men were covered with sweat From the time the sun the king of stars the torch of the eternal one rose chearful above the hills till he returned to his habitation There lay many of the northern men pierced with lances they lay wounded with their shields pierced through and also the Scots the hateful harvest of battle The chosen bands of the WestSaxons going out to battle pressed on the steps of the detested nations and slew their flying rear with sharp and bloody swords The soft effeminate men yielded up their spears The Mercians did not fear or fly the rough game of the hand There was no safety to them who sought the land with Anlaff in the bosom of the ship to die in fight Five youthful kings fell in the place of fight slain with swords and seven captains of Anlaff with the innumerable army of Scottish mariners there the lord of the Normans Northernmen was chased and their army now made small was driven to the prow of the ship The ship sounded with the waves and the king marching into the yellow sea escaped alive And so it was the wise northern king Constantine a veteran chief returning by flight to his own army bowed down in the camp left his own son worn out with wounds in the place of slaughter in vain did he lament his earls in vain his lost friends Nor less did Anlaff the yellowhaired leader the battleax of slaughter a youth in war but an old man in understanding boast himself a conqueror in fight when the darts flew against Edward's earls and their banners met Then those northern soldiers covered with shame the sad refuse of darts in the resounding whirlpool of Humber departed in their ships with rudders to seek through the deep the Irish city and their own land While both the brothers the  king and Clito lamenting even their own victory together returned home leaving behind them the fleshdevouring raven the darkblue toad greedy of slaughter the black crow with horny bill and the hoarse toad the eagle a companion of battles with the devouring kite and that brindled savage beast the wolf of the wood to be glutted with the white food of the slain Never was so great a slaughter in this island since the Angles and Saxons the fierce beginners of war coming hither from the east and seeking Britain through the wide sea overcame the Britons excelling in honour and gained possession of their land  The original was first printed by Wheloc in the Saxon Chronicle p Cant See Hickes Thes Praefat p xiv And ibid Gramm AngloSax p  "  This piece and many other Saxon odes and songs now remaining are written in a metre much resembling that of the scaldic dialogue at the tomb of Angantyr which has been beautifully translated into English in the true spirit of the original and in a genuine strain of poetry by Gray The extemporaneous effusions of the glowing bard seem naturally to have fallen into this measure and it was probably more easily suited to the voice or harp Their versification for the most part seems to have been that of the Runic poetry  As literature the certain attendant as it is the parent of true religion and civility gained ground among the Saxons poetry no longer remained a separate science and the profession of bard seems gradually to have declined among them I mean the bard under those appropriated characteristics and that peculiar appointment which he sustained among the Scandinavian pagans Yet their national love of verse and music still so strongly predominated that in the place of their old scalders a new rank of poets arose called GLEEMEN or Harpers  GLEEMAN answers to the Latin JOCULATOR Fabyan speaking of Blagebride an antient British king famous for his skill in poetry and music calls him  "a conynge musicyan called of the Britons god of GLEEMEN  CHRON f xxxii ed  This Fabyan translated from Geoffrey of Monmouth's account of the same British king  "ut DEUS

his presence Malmesb Gest Pontif lib iii p edit vet And Concil Spelman tom i p edit fol  These probably gave  rise to the order of English Minstrels who flourished till the sixteenth century  And here I stop to point out one of the principal reasons why the Scandinavian bards have transmitted to modern times so much more of their native poetry than the rest of their southern neighbours It is true that the inhabitants of Sweden Denmark and Norway whether or no from their Asiatic origin from their poverty which compelled them to seek fortunes at foreign courts by the exercise of a popular art from the success of their bards the nature of their republican government or their habits of unsettled life were more given to verse than any other Gothic or even Celtic tribe But this is not all they remained pagans and retained their original manners much longer than any of their Gothic kindred They were not completely converted to christianity till the tenth century  See bishop Lloyd's Hist Account of Church Government in Great Britain c chap i § pag to Lond And Crymog Arngrim L i cap p  Hence under the concurrence however of some of the causes just mentioned their scaldic profession acquired greater degrees of strength and of maturity and from an uninterrupted possession through many ages of the most romantic religious superstitions and the preservation of those rough manners which are so favourable to the poetical spirit was enabled to produce not only more genuine but more numerous compositions True religion would have checked the impetuosity of their passions suppressed their wild exertions of fancy and banished that striking train of imagery which their  poetry derived from a barbarous theology This circumstance also suggests to our consideration those superior advantages and opportunities arising from leisure and length of time which they enjoyed above others of circulating their poetry far and wide of giving a general currency to their mode of fabling of rendering their skill in versification more universally and familiarly known and a more conspicuous and popular object of admiration or imitation to the neighbouring countries Hence too it has happened that modern times have not only attained much fuller information concerning their historical transactions but are so intimately acquainted with the peculiarities of their character  It is probable that the Danish invasions produced a considerable alteration in the manners of our AngloSaxon ancestors Although their connections with England were transient and interrupted and on the whole scarcely lasted two hundred years yet many of the Danish customs began to prevail among the inhabitants which seem to have given a new turn to their temper and genius The Danish fashion of excessive drinking for instance a vice almost natural to the northern nations became so general among the AngloSaxons that it was found necessary to restrain so pernicious and contagious a practice by a particular statute  See Lambarde's Archaionom And Bartholin ii c xii p  Hence it seems likely that so popular an entertainment as their poetry gained ground especially if we consider that in their expeditions against England they were of course attended by many northern scalds who constantly made a part of their military retinue and whose language was understood by the Saxons Rogwald lord of the Orcades who was also himself a poet going on an expedition into Palestine carried with him two Islandic bards  g  Ol Worm Lit Run p edit  The noble ode called  in the northern chronicles the ELOGIUM OF HACON  In this ode are these very sublime imageries and prosopopeas  "The goddesses who preside over battles come sent forth by Odin They go to chuse among the princes of the illustrious race of Yngvon a man who is to perish and to go to dwell in the palace of the gods"  "Gondola leaned on the end of her lance and thus bespoke her companions The assembly of the gods is going to be increased the gods invite Hacon with his numerous host to enter the palace of Odin"  "Thus spake these glorious nymphs of war who were seated on their horses who were covered with their shields and helmets and appeared full of some great thought"  "Hacon heard their discourse Why said he why hast thou thus disposed of the battle Were we not worthy to have obtained of the gods a more perfect victory It is we she replied who have given it thee It is we who have put thine enemies to flight"  "Now added she let us push forward our steeds across those green worlds which are the residence of the god  Let us go tell Odin that the king is coming to visit him in his palace"  "When Odin heard this news he said Hermode and Brago my sons go to meet the king a king admired by all men for his valour approaches to our hall"  "At length king Hacon approaches and arriving from the battle is still all besprinkled and running down with blood At the sight of Odin he cries out Ah how severe and terrible does this god appear to me"  "The hero Brago replies Come thou that wast the terror of the bravest warriors Come hither and rejoin thine eight brothers the heroes who reside here shall live with thee in peace Go drink Ale in the circle of heroes"  "But this valiant king exclaims I will still keep my arms a warrior ought carefully to preserve his mail and helmet it is dangerous to be a

chiefs appear to have so frequently hazarded their lives with such amazing intrepidity merely in expectation of meriting a panegyric from their poets the judges and the spectators of their gallant behaviour That scalds were common in the Danish armies when they invaded England appears from a stratagem of Alfred who availing himself of his skill in oral poetry and playing on the harp entered the Danish camp habited in that character and procured a hospitable reception This was in the year  Ingulph Hist p Malmesb ii c p  Anlaff a Danish king used the same disguise for reconnoitring the camp of our Saxon monarch Athelstan taking his station near Athelstan's pavilion he entertained the king and his chiefs with his verses and music and was dismissed with an honourable reward  Malmesb ii I am aware that the truth of both these anecdotes respecting Alfred and Anlaff has been controverted But no sufficient argument has yet been offered for pronouncing them spurious or even suspicious See an ingenious Dissertation in the ARCHAEOLOGIA vol ii p seq A D to  As Anlaff's dialect must have discovered him to have been a Dane here is a proof of what I shall bring more that the Saxons even in the midst of mutual hostilities treated the Danish scalds with favour and respect That the Islandic bards were common in England during the Danish invasions there are numerous proofs Egill a celebrated Islandic poet having murthered the son and many of the friends of Eric Blodoxe king of Denmark or Norway then residing in Northumberland and which he had just conquered procured a pardon by singing before the king at the command of his queen Gunhilde an extemporaneous ode  See Crymogr Angrim Jon Lib ii pag edit  Egill compliments the king who probably was his patron with the appellation of the  English chief  "I offer my freight to the king I owe a poem for my ransom I present to the ENGLISH CHIEF the mead of Odin  See Ol Worm Lit Run p All the chiefs of Eric were also present at the recital of this ode which is in a noble strain  "  Afterwards he calls this Danish conqueror the commander of the Scottish fleet  "The commander of the Scottish fleet fattened the ravenous birds The sister of Nera Death trampled on the foe she trampled on the evening food of the eagle"  The Scots usually joined the Danish or Norwegian invaders in their attempts on the northern parts of Britain  See the Saxon epinicion in praise of king Athelstan supr citat Hen Hunting L v p  and from this circumstance a new argument arises to shew the close communication and alliance which must have subsisted between Scotland and Scandinavia Egill although of the enemy's party was a singular favourite of king Athelstan Athelstan once asked Egill how he escaped due punishment from Eric Blodoxe the king of Northumberland for the very capital and enormous crime which I have just mentioned On which Egill immediately related the whole of that transaction to the Saxon king in a sublime ode still extant  Torfaeus Hist Orcad Praefat  "Rei statim ordinem metro nunc satis obscuro exposuit"  Torfaeus adds which is much to our purpose  "nequaquam ita narraturus NON INTELLIGENTI"  On another occasion Athelstan presented Egill with two rings and two large cabinets filled with silver promising at the same time to grant him any gift or favour which he should chuse to request Egill struck with gratitude immediately composed a panegyrical poem in the Norwegian language then common to both nations on the virtues of Athelstan which the latter as generously requited with two marcs of pure gold  Crymog Arn Jon p ut supr  Here is likewise another argument that the Saxons had no small esteem for the scaldic poetry It is highly reasonable to conjecture that our Danish king Canute a potentate of most extensive jurisdiction and not only king of  England but of Denmark Sweden and Norway was not without the customary retinue of the northern courts in which the scalds held so distinguished and important a station Human nature in a savage state aspires to some species of merit and in every stage of society is alike susceptible of flattery when addressed to the reigning passion The sole object of these northern princes was military glory It is certain that Canute delighted in this mode of entertainment which he patronised and liberally rewarded It is related in KNYTLINGASAGA or Canute's History that he commanded the scald Loftunga to be put to death for daring to comprehend his atchievements in too concise a poem  "Nemo said he ante te ausus est de me BREVES CANTILENAS componere"  A curious picture of the tyrant the patron and the barbarian united But the bard extorted a speedy pardon and with much address by producing the next day before the king at dinner an ode of more than thirty strophes for which Canute gave him fifty marcs of purified silver  Bartholin Antiquit Danic Lib i cap p See KNYTLINGA SAGA in Catal Codd MSS Bibl Holm Hickes Thesaur ii  In the mean time the Danish language began to grow perfectly familiar in England It was eagerly learned by the Saxon clergy and nobility from a principle of ingratiating themselves with Canute and there are many manuscripts now remaining by which it will appear that the Danish runes were much studied among our Saxon ancestors under the reign of that monarch  Hickes ubi supr i    The songs of the Irish bards are by some conceived to be strongly marked with the traces of scaldic imagination and these traces which will be reconsidered are believed still to survive among a species of poetical historians whom they call TALETELLERS supposed to be the descendants of the original Irish bards  We are informed by the Irish historians that saint Patrick when he converted Ireland to the Christian faith destroyed three hundred volumes of the songs of the Irish bards Such was their dignity in this country that they were permitted to wear a robe of the same colour with that of the royal family They were constantly summoned to a triennial festival and the most approved songs delivered at this assembly were ordered to be preserved in the custody of the king's historian or antiquary Many of these compositions are referred to by Keating as the foundation of his history of Ireland Ample estates were appropriated to them that they might live in a condition of independence and ease The profession was hereditary but when a bard died his estate devolved not to his eldest son but to such of his family as discovered the most distinguished talents for poetry and music Every principal bard retained thirty of inferior note as his attendants and a bard of the secondary class was followed by a retinue of fifteen They seem to have been at their height in the year See Keating's History of Ireland p And Pref p None of their poems have been translated  There is an article in the LAWS of Keneth king of Scotland promulged in the year which places the bards of Scotland who certainly were held in equal esteem with those of the neighbouring countries in the lowest station  "Fugitivos BARDOS otio addictos s  urras et hujusmodi hominum genus loris et flagris caedunto"  Apud Hector Boeth Lib x p edit  But Salmasius very justly observes that for BARDOS we should read VARGOS or VERGOS i e Vagabonds  A writer of equal elegance and veracity  city relates  "that a gentleman of the north of Ireland has often told me of his own experience that in his wolfhuntings there when he used to be abroad in the mountains three or four days together and laid very ill in the night so as he could not well sleep they would bring him one of these TALETELLERS that when he lay down would begin a story of a KING or a GIANT a DWARF and a DAMSEL  Sir W Temple's Essays part iv p  "  These are topics in which the Runic poetry is said to have been greatly conversant  Nor is it improbable that the Welsh bards  The bards of Britain were originally a constitutional appendage of the druidical hierarchy In the parish of Llanidan in the isle of Anglesey there are still to be seen the ruins of an archdruid's mansion which they call TRER DREW that is the DRUID'S MANSION Near it are marks of the habitations of the separate conventual societies which were under his immediate orders and inspection Among these is TRER BEIRD or as they call it to this day the HAMLET OF THE BARDS Rowlands's MONA p But so strong was the attachment of the Celtic nations among which we reckon Britain to poetry that amidst all the changes of government and manners even long after the order of Druids was extinct and the national religion altered the bards acquiring a sort of civil capacity and a new establishment still continued to flourish And with regard to Britain the bards flourished most in those parts of it which most strongly retained their native Celtic character The Britons living in those countries that were between the Trent or Humber and the Thames by far the greatest portion of this island in the midst of the Roman garrisons and colonies had been so long inured to the customs of the Romans that they preserved very little of the British and from this long and habitual intercourse before the fifth century they seem to have lost their original language We cannot discover the slightest trace in the poems of the bards the LIVES of the British saints or any other antient monument that they held any correspondence with the Welsh the Cornish the Cumbrian or the Strathcluyd Britons Among other British institutions grown obsolete among them they seem to have lost the use of Bards at least there are no memorials of any they had nor any of their songs remaining nor do the Welsh or Cumbrian poets ever touch upon any transactions that passed in those countries after they were relinquished by the Romans  And here we see the reason why the Welsh bards flourished so much and so long But moreover the Welsh kept in awe as they were by the Romans harrassed by the Saxons and eternally jealous of the attacks the encroachments and the neighbourhood of aliens were on this account attached to their Celtic manners this situation and these circumstances inspired them with a pride and an obstinacy for mantaining a national distinction and for preserving their antient usages among which the bardic profession is so eminent  might have been acquainted with the Scandinavian scalds I mean before  their communications with Armorica mentioned at large above The prosody of the Welsh bards depended much on alliteration  See infr SECT x p  Hence they seem to have paid an attention to the scaldic versification The Islandic poets are said to have carried alliteration to the highest pitch of exactness in their earliest periods whereas the Welsh bards of the sixth century used it but sparingly and in a very imperfect degree In this circumstance a proof of imitation at least of emulation is implied  I am however informed by a very intelligent antiquary in British literature that there are manifest marks of alliteration in some druidical fragments still remaining undoubtedly composed before the Britons could have possibly mixed in the smallest degree with any Gothic nation Rhyme is likewise found in the British poetry at the earliest period in those druidical triplets called ENGLYN MILWR or the WARRIOR'S SONG in which every verse is closed with a consonant syllable See a metrical Druid oracle in Borlase's Antiquit Cornwall B iii ch p edit  There are moreover strong instances of conformity between the manners of the two nations which however may be accounted for on general principles arising from our comparative observations on rude life Yet it is remarkable that mead the northern nectar or favourite liquor of the Goths  And of the antient Franks Gregory of

Cathay or great Cham of Tartary is seated at dinner in high pomp with his lords  "no man is so hardi to speak to him except it be MUSICIANS  to solace the emperour  "  chap lxvii p  Here is another proof of the correspondence between the eastern and northern customs and this instance might be brought as an argument of the bardic institution being fetched from the east Leo Afer mentions the  Poetae curiae  of the Caliph's court at Bagdad about the year De Med et Philos Arab cap iv Those poets were in most repute among the Arabians who could speak extemporaneous verses to the Caliph Euseb Renaudot apud Fabric Bibl Gr xiii p Thomson in the CASTLE of INDOLENCE mentions the BARD IN WAITING being introduced to lull the Caliph asleep And Maundeville mentions MINSTRELLES as established officers in the court of the emperor of Cathay  Nor must I pass over what reflects much light on this reasoning that the establishment of the houshold of the old Irish chiefs exactly resembles that of the Welsh kings For besides the bard the musician and the smith they have both a physician a huntsman and other corresponding officers  See Temple ubi supr p  We must also remember that an intercourse was necessarily produced between the Welsh and Scandinavians from the piratical irruptions of the latter their scalds as I have already remarked were respected and patronised in the courts of those princes whose territories were the principal objects of the Danish invasions Torfaeus expressly affirms this of the AngloSaxon and Irish kings and it is  at least probable that they were entertained with equal regard by the Welsh princes who so frequently concurred with the Danes in distressing the English It may be added that the Welsh although living in a separate and detached situation and so strongly prejudiced in favour of their own usages yet from neighbourhood and unavoidable communications of various kinds might have imbibed the ideas of the Scandinavian bards from the Saxons and Danes after those nations had occupied and overspread all the other parts of our island  Many pieces of the Scottish bards are still remaining in the highlands of Scotland Of these a curious specimen and which considered in a more extensive and general respect is a valuable monument of the poetry of a rude period has lately been given to the world under the title of the WORKS OF OSSIAN It is indeed very remarkable that in these poems the terrible graces which so naturally characterise and so generally constitute the early poetry of a barbarous people should so frequently give place to a gentler set of manners to the social sensibilities of polished life and a more civilised and elegant species of imagination Nor is this circumstance which disarranges all our established ideas concerning the savage stages of society easily to be accounted for unless we suppose that the Celtic tribes who were so strongly addicted to poetical composition and who made it so much their study from the earliest times might by degrees have attained a higher vein of poetical refinement than could at first sight or on common principles be expected among nations whom we are accustomed to call barbarous that some few instances of an elevated strain of friendship of love and other sentimental feelings existing in such nations might lay the foundation for introducing a set of manners among the bards more refined and exalted than the real manners of the country and that panegyrics on those virtues transmitted with improvements  from bard to bard must at length have formed characters of ideal excellence which might propagate among the people real manners bordering on the poetical These poems however notwithstanding the difference between the Gothic and the Celtic rituals contain many visible vestiges of Scandinavian superstition The allusions in the songs of Ossian to spirits who preside over the different parts and direct the various operations of nature who send storms over the deep and rejoice in the shrieks of the shipwrecked mariner who call down lightning to blast the forest or cleave the rock and diffuse irresistible pestilence among the people beautifully conducted indeed and heightened under the skilful hand of a master bard entirely correspond with the Runic system and breathe the spirit of its poetry One fiction in particular the most EXTRAVAGANT in all Ossian's poems is founded on an essential article of the Runic belief It is where Fingal fights with the spirit of Loda Nothing could aggrandise Fingal's heroism more highly than this marvellous encounter It was esteemed among the antient Danes the most daring act of courage to engage with a ghost  Bartholin De Contemptu Mortis apud Dan L ii c p And ibid p There are many other marks of Gothic customs and superstitions in Ossian The fashion of marking the sepulchres of their chiefs with circles of stones corresponds with what Olaus Wormius relates of the Danes Monum Danic Hafn p See also Ol Magn Hist xvi In the HERVARER SAGA the sword of Suarfulama is forged by the dwarfs and called Tirsing Hickes vol i p So Fingal's sword was made by an enchanter and was called the SON of LUNO And what

countries made him a celebrated enchanter By the way the names of swordsmiths were thought worthy to be recorded in history Hoveden says that when Geoffrey of Plantagenet was knighted they brought him

mentioned as a skilful artist in history becomes a magician or a preternatural being in romance  Had Ossian found it convenient to have introduced religion into his compositions  This perplexing and extraordinary circumstance I mean the absence of all religious ideas from the poems of Ossian is accounted for by Mr Macpherson with much address See DISSERTATION prefixed vol i p viii ix edit See also the elegant CRITICAL DISSERTATION of the very judicious Dr Blair vol ii p  not only a new source had  been opened to the sublime in describing the rites of sacrifice the horrors of incantation the solemn evocations of infernal beings and the like dreadful superstitions but probably many stronger and more characteristical evidences would have appeared of his knowledge of the imagery of the

measure used to their language well acquainted with their manners and conversant in their poetry Charlemagne is said to have delighted in repeating the most antient and barbarous odes which celebrated the battles of antient kings  Eginhart cap viii n Bartholin i c p Diodorus Siculus says that the Gauls who were Celts delivered the spoils won in battle yet reeking with blood to their attendants these were carried in triumph while an epinicial song was chanted  Lib p See also p  "The Celts says Aelian I hear are the most enterprising of men they make those warriors who die bravely in fight

gather crouds of his people together and to throw them gold and silver from his chariot Once he was attended at a sumptuous banquet by one of their bards who received in reward for his song a purse of gold On this the bard renewed his song adding to express his patron's excessive generosity this hyperbolical panegyric  "The earth over which his chariotwheels pass instantly brings forth gold and precious gifts to enrich mankind"  Athen vi  Tacitus says that Arminius the conqueror of Varus  "is yet sung among the barbarous nations"  That is probably among the original Germans A  nal ii And Mor

from a manuscript in the monastery of Saint Amand in Holland I will give a specimen from Schilter's Latin interpretation but not on account of the merit of the poetry  "The king seized his shield and lance galloping hastily He truly wished to revenge himself on his adversaries Nor was there a long delay he found the Normans He said thanks be to God at seeing what he desired The king rushed on

christianity it is hard to find any of their native songs But I must except the poems of Ossian which are noble and genuine remains of the Celtic poetry    But we are not informed whether these were Scandinavian Celtic or Teutonic poems  About the beginning of the tenth century France was invaded by the Normans or NORTHERNMEN an army of adventurers from Norway Denmark and Sweden And although the conquerors especially when their success does not solely depend on superiority of numbers usually assume  the manners of the conquered yet these strangers must have still further familiarised in France many of their northern fictions  From this general circulation in these and other countries and from that popularity which it is natural to suppose they must have acquired the scaldic inventions might have taken deep root in Europe  Of the long continuance of the Celtic superstitions in the popular belief see what is said in the most elegant and judicious piece of criticism which the present age has produced Mrs Montague's ESSAY ON SHAKESPEARE p edit  At least they seem to have prepared the way for the more easy admission of the Arabian fabling about the ninth century by which they were however in great measure superseded The Arabian fictions were of a more splendid nature and better adapted to the increasing civility of the times Less horrible and gross they had a novelty a variety and a magnificence which carried with them the charm of fascination Yet it is probable that many of the scaldic imaginations might have been blended with the Arabian In the mean time there is great reason to believe that the Gothic scalds enriched their vein of fabling from this new and fruitful source of fiction opened by the Arabians in Spain and afterwards propagated by the crusades It was in many respects cogenial with their own  Besides the general wildness of the imagery in both among other particular circumstances of coincidence which might be mentioned here the practice of giving names to swords which we find in the scaldic poems occurs also among the Arabians In the HERVARER SAGA the sword of Suar  ulama is called TIRFING Hickes Thes i p The names of swords of many of

some perhaps may think them proofs of the doctrine just now suggested in the text that the scalds borrowed from the Arabians  and the northern bards who visited the countries  where these new fancies were spreading must have been naturally struck with such wonders and were certainly fond of picking up fresh embellishments and new strokes of the marvellous for augmenting and improving their stock

Scandinavian tribes had been converted to christianity that is as I have before observed about the close of the tenth century These barbarians had an infinite and a national contempt for the christians whose religion inculcated a spirit of peace gentleness and civility qualities so dissimilar to those of their own  ferocious and warlike disposition and which they naturally interpreted to be the marks of cowardice and pusillanimity  Regner Lodbrog in his DYING ODE speaking of a battle fought against the christians says in ridicule of the eucharist  "There we celebrated a MASS Missu  Island  of weapons"  It has however been urged that as the irruption of the Normans into France under their leader Rollo did not take place till towards the beginning of the tenth century at which period the scaldic art was arrived to the highest perfection in Rollo's native country we can easily trace the descent of the French and English romances of chivalry from the Northern Sagas It is supposed that Rollo carried with him many scalds from the north who transmitted their skill to their children and successors and that these adopting the religion opinions and language of the new country substituted the heroes of christendom instead of those of their pagan ancestors and began to celebrate the feats of Charlemagne Roland and Oliver whose true history they set off and embellished with the scaldic figments of dwarfs giants dragons and inchantments  Percy's Ess Metr Rom p viii  There is however some reason to believe that these fictions were current among the French long before and if the principles advanced in the former part of this dissertation be true the fables adhering to Charlemagne's real history must be referred to another source  Let me add that the inchantments of the Runic poetry are very different from those in our romances of chivalry The former chiefly deal in spells and charms such as would preserve from poison blunt the weapons of an enemy procure victory allay a tempest cure bodily diseases or call the dead from their tombs in uttering a form of mysterious words or inscribing Runic characters The magicians of romance are chiefly employed in forming and conducting a train of deceptions There is an air of barbaric horror in the  incantations of the scaldic fablers the magicians of romance often present visions of pleasure and delight and although not without their alarming terrors sometimes lead us through flowery forests and raise up palaces glittering with gold and precious stones The Runic magic is more like that of Canidia in Horace the romantic resembles that of Armida in Tasso The operations of the one are frequently but mere tricks in comparison of that sublime solemnity of necromantic machinery which the other so awefully displays  It is also remarkable that in the earlier scaldic odes we find but few dragons giants and fairies These were introduced afterwards and are the progeny of Arabian fancy Nor indeed do these imaginary beings often occur in any of the compositions which preceded the introduction of that species of fabling On this reasoning the Irish taleteller mentioned above could not be a lineal descendant of the elder Irish bards The absence of giants and dragons and let me add of many other traces of that fantastic and brilliant imagery which composes the system of Arabian imagination from the poems of Ossian are a striking proof of their antiquity It has already been suggested at what period and from what origin those fancies got footing in the Welsh poetry we do not find them in the odes of Taliessin or Aneurin  Who flourished about the year He has left a long spirited poem called GODODIN often alluded to by the later Welsh bards which celebrates a battle fought against the Saxons near Cattraeth under the conduct of Mynnydawe Eiddin in which all the Britons three only excepted among which was the bard Aneurin himself were slain I will give a specimen  "The men whose drink was mead comely in shape hastened to Cattraeth These impetuous warriors in ranks armed with red spears long and bending began the battle Might I speak my revenge against the people of the Deiri I would overwhelm them like a deluge in one slaughter for unheeding I have lost a friend who was brave in resisting his enemies I drank of the wine and metheglin of Mordai whose spear was of huge size In the shock of the battle he prepared food for the eagle When Cydwal hastened forward a shout arose before the yellow morning when he gave the signal he broke the shield into small splinters The men hastened to Cattraeth noble in birth their drink was wine and mead out of golden cups There were three hundred and sixty three adorned with chains of gold but of those who filled with wine rushed on to the fight only three escaped who hewed their way with the sword the warrior of Acron Conan Dacarawd and I the bard Aneurin red with blood otherwise I should not have survived to compose this song When Caradoc hastened to the war he was the son of a wild boar in hewing down the Saxons a bull in the conflict of fight he twisted the wood spear from their hands Gurien saw not his father after he had lifted the glistening mead in his hand I praise all the warriors who thus met in the battle and attacked the foe with one mind Their life was short but they have left a long regret to their friends Yet of the Saxons they slew more than seven There was many a mother shedding tears The song is due to thee who hast attained the highest glory thou who wast like fire thunder and storm O Rudd Fedell warlike champion excellent in might you still think of the war The noble chiefs deserve to be celebrated in verse who after the fight made the rivers to overflow their banks with blood Their hands glutted the throats of the darkbrown eagles and skilfully prepared food for the ravenous birds Of all the chiefs who went to Cattraeth with golden chains"  c This poem is extremely difficult to be understood being written if not in the Pictish language at least in a dialect of the Britons very different from the modern Welsh See the learned and ingenious Mr Evans's DISSERTATIO DE BARDIS p  This reasoning explains an observation  of an ingenious critic in this species of literature and who has studied the works of the Welsh bards with much attention  "There are not such extravagant FLIGHTS in any poetic compositions except it be in the EASTERN to which as far as I can judge by the few translated specimens I have seen they  bear a near resemblance  Evans ubi supr Pref p iv  "  I will venture to say he does not meet with these flights in the elder Welsh bards The beautiful romantic fiction that king Arthur after being wounded in the fatal battle of Camlan was conveyed by an Elfin princess into the land of Faery or spirits to be healed of his wounds that he reigns there still as a mighty potentate in all his pristine splendour and will one day return to resume his throne in Britain and restore the solemnities of his champions often occurs in the antient Welsh bards  The Arabians call the Fairies  Ginn  and the Persians  Peri  The former calls Fairyland  Ginnistian  many beautiful cities of which they have described in their fabulous histories See Herbelot Bibl Orient GIAN p a GENN p a PERI p b They pretend that the fairies built the city

elfin queen called in the French romances MORGAIN LE FAY Morgain the fairy who preserved king Arthur See Obs on Spenser's Fairy Queen i § ii  But not in the most antient It  is found in the compositions of the Welsh bards only who flourished after the native vein of British fabling had been tinctured by these FAIRY TALES which the Arabians had propagated in Armorica and which the Welsh had received from their connection with that province of Gaul Such a fiction as this is entirely different from the cast and complection of the ideas of the original Welsh poets It is easy to collect from the Welsh odes written after the tenth century many signatures of this EXOTIC imagery Such as  "Their assault was like strong lions He is valourous as a lion who can resist his lance The dragon of Mona's sons were so brave in fight that there was horrible consternation and upon Tal Moelvre a thousand banners Our lion has brought to Trallwng three armies A dragon he was from the beginning unterrified in battle A dragon of Ovain Thou art a prince firm in battle like an elephant Their assault was as of strong lions The lion of Cemais fierce in the onset when the army rusheth to be covered with red He saw Llewellyn like a burning dragon in the strife of Arson He is furious in fight like an outrageous dragon Like the roaring of a furious lion in the search of prey is thy thirst of praise"  Instead of producing more proofs from the multitude that might be mentioned for the sake of illustration of our argument I will contrast these with some of their natural unadulterated thoughts  "Fetch the drinking horn whose gloss is like the wave of the sea Tudor is like a wolf rushing on his prey They were all covered with blood when they returned and the high hills and the dales enjoyed the sun equally  The high mountains in Merionethshire  O thou virgin that shinest like the snow on the brows of Aran  A beautiful periphrasis for noon day and extremely natural in so mountainous a country as Wales This circumstance of time added to the merit of the action  like the fine spiders webs on the grass on a summer's day The army at Offa's dike panted  for glory the soldiers of Venedotia and the men of London were as the alternate motion of the waves on the seashore where the seamew screams The hovering crows were numberless the ravens croaked they were ready to suck the prostrate carcases His enemies are scattered as leaves on the side of hills driven by hurricanes He is a warrior like a surge on the beach that covers the wild salmons Her eye was piercing

on the beach where the seagulls whose plumes glitter sport on the bed of billows and where the herbage growing in a solitary place is of a deep green  See Evans ubi supr p And his Diss de Bard p Compare Aneurin's ode cited above  "  These images are all drawn from their own country from their situation and circumstances and although highly poetical are in general of a more sober and temperate colouring In a word not only that elevation of allusion which many suppose to be peculiar to the poetry of Wales but that fertility of fiction and those marvellous fables recorded in Geoffrey of Monmouth which the generality of readers who do not sufficiently attend to the origin of that historian's romantic materials believe to be the genuine offspring of the Welsh poets are of foreign growth And to return to the ground of this argument there is the strongest reason to suspect that even the Gothic EDDA or system of poetic mythology of the northern nations is enriched with those higher strokes of oriental imagination which the Arabians had communicated to the Europeans Into this extravagant tissue of unmeaning allegory false philosophy and false theology it was easy to incorporate their most wild and romantic conceptions  Huet is of opinion that the EDDA is entirely the production of Snorro's fancy But this is saying too much See Orig Roman p The first Edda was compiled undoubtedly with many additions and interpolations from fictions and traditions in the old Runic poems by Soemund Sigfusson surnamed the Learned about the year He seems to have made it his business to select or digest into one body such of these pieces as were best calculated to furnish a collection of poetic phrases and figures He studied in Germany and chiefly at Cologne This first Edda being not only prolix but perplexed and obscure a second which is that now extant was compiled by Snorro Sturleson born in the year  It is certain and very observable that in the EDDA we find much more of giants dragons and other imaginary beings undoubtedly belonging to Arabian romance then in the earlier Scaldic odes By the way there are many strokes in both the EDDAS taken from the REVEL ATIONS of Saint John which must come from the compilers who were Christ ians    It must be confessed that the ideas of chivalry the appendage and the subject of romance subsisted among the Goths But this must be understood under certain limitations There is no peculiarity which more strongly discriminates the manners of the Greeks and Romans from those of modern times than that small degree of attention and respect with which those nations treated the fair sex and that inconsiderable share which they were permitted to take in conversation and the general commerce of life For the truth of this observation we need only appeal to the classic writers in which their women appear to have been devoted to a state of seclusion and obscurity One is surprised that barbarians should be greater masters of complaisance than the most polished people that ever existed No sooner was the Roman empire overthrown and the Goths had overpowered Europe than we find the female character assuming an unusual importance and authority and distinguished with new privileges in all the European governments established by the northern conquerors Even amidst the confusions of savage war and among the almost incredible enormities committed by the Goths at their invasion of the empire they forbore to offer any violence to the women This perhaps is one of the most striking features in the new state of manners which took place about the seventh century and it is to this period and to this people that we must refer the origin of gallantry in Europe The Romans never introduced these sentiments into their European provinces  The Goths believed some divine and prophetic quality to be inherent in their women they admitted them into their councils and consulted them on the public business of the state They were suffered to conduct the great events which they predicted Ganna a prophetic virgin of the Marcomanni a German or Gaulish tribe was sent by her nation to Rome and admitted into the presence of Domitian to treat concerning terms of peace  Dio lib lxvii p  Tacitus relates that Velleda another German prophetess held frequent conferences with the Roman generals and that on some occasions on account of the sacredness of her person she was placed at a great distance on a high tower from whence like an oracular divinity she conveyed her answers by some chosen messenger  Hist

source  Their matrons and daughters acquired a reverence from their skill in studying simples and their knowledge of healing wounds arts reputed mysterious The wives frequently attended their husbands in the most perilous expeditions and fought with great intrepidity in the most bloody engagements  See SECT vii infr p Diodorus Siculus says that among the Scythians the women are trained to war as well as the men to whom they are not inferior in strength and courage L ii p  These nations dreaded  captivity more on the account of their women than on their own and the Romans availing themselves of this apprehension often demanded their noblest virgins for hostages  Tacit de Morib Germ pag ut supr  From these circumstances the women even claimed a sort of precedence at least an equality subsisted between the sexes in the Gothic constitutions  But the deference paid to the fair sex which produced the spirit of gallantry is chiefly to be sought for in those strong and exaggerated ideas of female chastity which prevailed among the northern nations Hence the lover's devotion to his mistress was encreased his attentions to her service multiplied his affection heightened and his sollicitude aggravated in proportion as the difficulty of obtaining her was enhanced and the passion of love acquired a degree of delicacy when controlled by the principles of honour and purity The highest excellence of character then known was a superiority in arms and that rival was most likely to gain his lady's regard who was the bravest champion Here we see valour inspired by love In the mean time the same heroic spirit which was the surest claim to the favour of the ladies was often exerted in their protection a protection much wanted in an age of rapine of plunder and piracy when the weakness of the softer sex was exposed to continual dangers and unexpected attacks  See instances of this sort of violence in the antient HISTORY of HIALMAR a Runic romance p Diss Epist Ad calc Hickes Thesaur vol i Where also is a challenge between two champions for king Hialmar's daughter But the king composes the quarrel by giving to one of them named Ulfo among other rich presents an inestimable horn on which were inlaid in gold the images of Odin Thor and Freya and to the other named Hramur the lady herself and a drum embossed with golden imagery which foretold future events This piece which is in Runic capital characters was written before the year Many stories of this kind might be produced from the northern chronicles  It is easy to suppose the officious emulation and ardour of many a gallant young warrior pressing forward to be foremost in this honourable service which flattered the most agreeable of all passions and which gratified every enthusiasm of the times  especially the fashionable fondness for a wandering and military life In the mean time we may conceive the lady thus won or thus defended conscious of her own importance affecting an air of stateliness it was her pride to have preserved her chastity inviolate she could perceive no merit but that of invincible bravery and could only be approached in terms of respect and submission  Among the Scandinavians a people so fond of cloathing adventures in verse these gallantries must naturally become the subject of poetry with its fictitious embellishments Accordingly we find their chivalry displayed in their odes pieces which at the same time greatly confirm these observations The famous ode of Regner Lodbrog affords a striking instance in which being imprisoned in a loathsome dungeon and condemned to be destroyed by venomous serpents he solaces his desperate situation by recollecting and reciting the glorious exploits of his past life One of these and the first which he commemorates was an atchievement of chivalry It was the delivery of a beautiful Swedish princess from an impregnable fortress in which she was forcibly detained by one of her father's captains Her father issued a proclamation promising that whoever would rescue the lady should have her in marriage Regner succeeded in the attempt and married the fair captive This was about the year  See Torf Hist Norw tom i lib Saxo Grammat p And Ol Worm Lit Rom p edit I suspect that the romantic amour between Regner and Aslauga is the forgery of a much later age See REGNARA LODBROG'S Saga C apud Biorneri Histor Reg Her et Pugil Res praeclar gest Stockholm  There are other strokes in Regner's ode which although not belonging to this particular story deserve to be pointed out here as illustrative of our argument Such as  "It was like being placed near a beautiful virgin on a couchIt was like kissing a young widow in the first seat at a feast I made to struggle in the twilight that goldenhaired chief who passed his mornings among the young maidens and loved to converse with  widowsHe who aspires to the love of young virgins ought always to be foremost in the din of arms  St  "  It is worthy of remark that these sentiments occur to Regner while he is in the midst of his tortures and at the point of death Thus many of the heroes in Froissart in the greatest extremities of danger recollect their amours and die thinking of their mistresses And by the way in the same strain Boh a Danish champion having lost his chin and one of his cheeks by a single stroke from Thurstain Midlang only reflected how he should be received when thus maimed and disfigured by the Danish girls He instantly exclaimed in a tone of savage gallantry  "The Danish virgins will not now willingly or easily give me kisses if I should perhaps return home  Chron Norveg p  "  But there is an ode in the KNYTLINGASAGA written by Harald the VALIANT which is professedly a song of chivalry and which exclusive of its wild spirit of adventure and its images of savage life has the romantic air of a set of stanzas composed by a Provencial troubadour Harald appears to have been one of the most eminent adventurers of his age He had killed the king of Drontheim in a bloody engagement He had traversed all the seas and visited all the coasts of the north and had carried his piratical enterprises even as far as the Mediterranean and the shores of Africa He was at length taken prisoner and detained for some time at Constantinople He complains in this ode that the reputation he had acquired by so many hazardous exploits by his skill in single combat riding swimming gliding along the ice darting rowing and guiding a ship through the rocks had not been able to make any impression on Elissiff or Elisabeth the beautiful daughter of Jarilas king of Russia  Bartholin p    Here however chivalry subsisted but in its rudiments Under the feudal establishments which were soon afterwards erected in Europe it received new vigour and was invested  with the formalities of a regular institution The nature and circumstances of that peculiar model of government were highly favourable to this strange spirit of fantastic heroism which however unmeaning and ridiculous it may seem had the most serious and salutary consequences in assisting the general growth of refinement and the progression of civilisation in forming the manners of Europe in inculcating the principles of honour and in teaching modes of decorum The genius of the feudal policy was perfectly martial A numerous nobility formed into separate principalities affecting independence and mutually jealous of their privileges and honours necessarily lived in a state of hostility This situation rendered personal strength and courage the most requisite and essential accomplishments And hence even in time of peace they had no conception of any diversions or public ceremonies but such as were of the military kind Yet as the courts of these petty princes were thronged with ladies of the most eminent distinction and quality the ruling passion for war was tempered with courtesy The prize of contending champions was adjudged by the ladies who did not think it inconsistent to be present or to preside at the bloody spectacles of the times and who themselves seem to have contracted an unnatural and unbecoming ferocity while they softened the manners of those valorous knights who fought for their approbation The high notions of a noble descent which arose from the condition of the feudal constitution and the ambition of forming an alliance with powerful and opulent families cherished this romantic system It was hard to obtain the fair feudatary who was the object of universal adoration Not only the splendor of birth but the magnificent castle surrounded with embattelled walls guarded with massy towers and crowned with lofty pinnacles served to inflame the imagination and to create an attachment to some illustrious heiress whose point of honour it was to be chaste and inaccessible And the difficulty  of success on these occasions seems in great measure to have given rise to that sentimental love of romance which acquiesced in a distant respectful admiration and did not aspire to possession The want of an uniform administration of justice the general disorder and state of universal anarchy which naturally sprung from the principles of the feudal policy presented perpetual opportunities of checking the oppressions of arbitrary lords of delivering captives injuriously detained in the baronial castles of punishing robbers of succouring the distressed and of avenging the impotent and the unarmed who were every moment exposed to the most licentious insults and injuries The violence and injustice of the times gave birth to valour and humanity These acts conferred a lustre and an importance on the character of men professing arms who made force the substitute of law In the mean time the crusades so pregnant with enterprize heightened the habits of this warlike fanaticism And when these foreign expeditions were ended in which the hermits and pilgrims of Palestine had been defended nothing remained to employ the activity of adventurers but the protection of innocence at home Chivalry by degrees was consecrated by religion whose authority tinctured every passion and was engrafted into every institution of the superstitious ages and at length composed that singular picture of manners in which the love of a god and of the ladies were reconciled the saint and the hero were blended and charity and revenge zeal and gallantry devotion and valour were united  Those who think that chivalry started late from the nature of the feudal constitution confound an improved effect with a simple cause Not having distinctly considered all the particularities belonging to the genius manners and usages of the Gothic tribes and accustomed to contemplate nations under the general idea of barbarians they cannot look for the seeds of elegance amongst men distinguished  only for their ignorance and their inhumanity The rude origin of this heroic gallantry was quickly overwhelmed and extinguished by the superior pomp which it necessarily adopted from the gradual diffusion of opulence and civility and that blaze of splendor with which it was surrounded amid the magnificence of the feudal solemnities But above all it was lost and forgotten in that higher degree of embellishment which at length it began to receive from the representations of romance  From the foregoing observations taken together the following general and comprehensive conclusion seems to result  Amid the gloom of superstition in an age of the grossest ignorance and credulity a taste for the wonders of oriental fiction was introduced by the Arabians into Europe many countries of which were already seasoned to a reception of its extravagancies by means of the poetry of the Gothic s  alds who perhaps originally derived their ideas from the fame fruitful region of invention These fictions coinciding with the reigning manners and perpetually kept up and improved in the tales of troubadours and minstrels seem to have centered about the eleventh century in the ideal histories of Turpin and Geoffrey of Monmouth which record the supposititious atchievements of Charlemagne and king Arthur where they formed the groundwork of that species of fabulous narrative called romance And from these beginnings or causes afterwards enlarged and enriched by kindred fancies fetched from the crusades that singular and capricious mode of imagination arose which at length composed the marvellous machineries of the more sublime Italian poets and of their disciple Spenser  ON THE INTRODUCTION OF LEARNING into ENGLAND  DISSERTATION II  THE irruption of the northern nations into the western empire about the beginning of the fourth century forms one of the most interesting and important periods of modern history Europe on this great event suffered the most memorable revolutions in its government and manners and from the most flourishing state of peace and civility became on a sudden and for the space of two centuries the theatre of the most deplorable devastation and disorder But among the disasters introduced by these irresistible barbarians the most calamitous seems to have been the destruction of those arts which the Romans still continued so successfully to cultivate in their capital and which they had universally communicated to their conquered provinces Towards the close of the fifth century very few traces of the Roman policy jurisprudence sciences and literature  remained Some faint sparks of knowledge were kept alive in the monasteries and letters and the liberal arts were happily preserved from a total extinction during the confusions of the Gothic invaders by that slender degree of culture and protection which they received from the prelates of the church and the religious communities  But notwithstanding the famous academy of Rome  Theodosius the younger in the year founded an academy at Constantinople which he furnished with able professors of every science intending it as a rival institution to that at Rome Gianon Hist Napl ii ch vi sect A noble library had been established at Constantinople by Constantius and Valens before the year the custody of which was committed to four Greek and three Latin antiquaries or curators It contained sixty thousand volumes Zonaras relates that among other treasures in this library there was a roll one hundred feet long made of a dragon's gutt or intestine on which Homer's Iliad and Odyssey were written in golden letters See Bibl Histor Literar Select c Ienae p seq Literature flourished in the eastern empire

royal charts or instruments a monument of singular utility to the historian and which has served to throw the  most authentic illustration on the public transactions and legal constitutions of those times Theodoric's patronage of learning is applauded by Claudian and Sidonius Apollinaris Many other Gothic kings were equally attached to the works of peace and are not less conspicuous for their justice prudence and temperance than for their fortitude and magnanimity Some of them were diligent in collecting the scattered remains of the Roman institutes and constructing a regular code of jurisprudence  Gianon Hist Nap iii c  It is highly probable that those Goths who became masters of Rome sooner acquired ideas of civility from the opportunity which that city above all others afforded them of seeing the felicities of polished life of observing the conveniencies arising from political economy of mixing with characters respectable for prudence and learning and of employing in their counsels men of superior wisdom whose instruction and advice they found it their interest to follow But perhaps these northern adventurers at least their princes and leaders were not even at their first migrations into the south so totally savage and uncivilised as we are commonly apt to suppose Their enemies have been their historians who naturally painted these violent disturbers of the general repose in the warmest colours It is not easy to conceive that the success of their amazing enterprizes was merely the effect of numbers and tumultuary depredation nor can I be persuaded that the lasting and flourishing governments which they established in various parts of Europe could have been framed by brutal force alone and the blind efforts of unreflecting savages Superior strength and courage must have contributed in a considerable degree to their rapid and extensive conquests but at the same time such mighty atchievements could not have been planned and executed without some extraordinary vigour of mind uniform principles of conduct and no common talents of political sagacity  Although these commotions must have been particularly unfavourable to the more elegant literature yet Latin poetry from a concurrence of causes had for some time begun to relapse into barbarism From the growing encrease of christianity it was deprived of its old fabulous embellishments and chiefly employed in composing ecclesiastical hymns Amid these impediments however and the necessary degeneration of taste and style a few poets supported the character of the Roman muse with tolerable dignity during the decline of the Roman empire These were Ausonius Paulinus Sidonius Sedulius Arator Juvencus Prosper and Fortunatus With the last who flourished at the beginning of the sixth century and was bishop of Poitiers the Roman poetry is supposed to have expired  In the sixth century Europe began to recover some degree of tranquillity Many barbarous countries during this period particularly the inhabitants of Germany of Friesland and other northern nations were converted to the christian faith  Cave Saecul Monoth p  The religious controversies which at this time divided the Greek and Latin churches roused the minds of men to literary enquiries These disputes in some measure called forth abilities which otherwise would have been unknown and unemployed and together with the subtleties of argumentation insensibly taught the graces of style and the habits of composition Many of the popes were persons of distinguished talents and promoted useful knowledge no less by example than authority Political union was by degrees established and regular systems of government which alone can ensure personal security arose in the various provinces of Europe

diffused a mildness of manners and introduced the arts of peace and awakening the human mind to a consciousness of its powers directed its faculties to their proper objects  In the mean time no small obstruction to the propagation or rather revival of letters was the paucity of valuable books The libraries particularly those of Italy which abounded in numerous and inestimable treasures of literature were every where destroyed by the precipitate rage and undistinguishing violence of the northern armies Towards the close of the seventh century even in the papal library at Rome the number of books was so inconsiderable that pope Saint Martin requested Sanctamand bishop of Maestricht if possible to supply this defect from the remotest parts of Germany  Concil Tom xv pag edit Paris  In the year Lupus abbot of Ferrieres in France sent two of his monks to pope Benedict the third to beg a copy of CICERO DE ORATORE and QUINTILIAN'S INSTITUTES  There are very early manuscripts of

the monks of England by archbishop Lanfranc in the year the following injunction occurs At the beginning of Lent the librarian is ordered to deliver a book to each of the religious a whole year was allowed for the perusal of this book and at the returning Lent those monks who had neglected to read the books they had respectively received are commanded to prostrate themselves before the  abbot and to supplicate his indulgence  "Unusquisque reddat librum qui ad legendum sibi alio anno fuerat commendatus et qui cognoverat se non legisse librum quem recepit prostratus culpam dicat et

deviating from my subject  After the calamities which the state of literature sustained in consequence of the incursions of the northern nations the first restorers of the antient philosophical sciences in Europe the study of which by opening the faculties and extending the views of mankind gradually led the way to other parts of learning were the Arabians In the beginning of the eighth century this wonderful people equally famous for their conquests and their love of letters in ravaging the Asiatic provinces found many Greek books which they read with infinite avidity and such was the gratification they received from this fortunate acquisition and so powerfully their curiosity was excited to make further discoveries in this new field of knowledge that they requested their caliphs to procure from the emperor at Constantinople the best Greek writers These they carefully translated into Arabic  See Abulfarag per Pocock Dynast p Greek was a familiar language to the Arabians The accompts of the caliph's treasury were always written in Greek till the year of Christ They were then ordered to be drawn in Arabic Many proofs of this might be mentioned Greek was a familiar language in Mahomet's houshold Zaid one of Mahomet's secretaries to whom he dictated the Koran was a perfect master of Greek Sale's Prelim Disc p The Arabic gold coins were always inscribed with Greek legends till about the year  But every part of the Grecian literature did not equally gratify their taste The Greek poetry they rejected because it inculcated polytheism and idolatry which were inconsistent with their religion Or perhaps it was too cold and too correct for their extravagant and romantic conceptions  Yet it appears from many of their fictions that some of the Greek poets were not unfamiliar among them perhaps long before the period assigned in the text Theophilus Edessenus a Maronite by profession an astronomer translated Homer into Syriac about the year Theophan Chronogr p Abulfarag ut supr p Reinesius in his very curious account of the  manuscript collection of Greek chemists  in the library of SaxeGotha relates that soon after the year the Arabians translated Homer and Pindar amongst other Greek books Ernest Salom Cyprian Catal Codd MSS Bibl Gothan p Apud Fabric Bibl Gr xii p It is however certain that the Greek philosophers were their objects Compare Euseb Renaudot de Barb Aristotel Versionib apud Fabric Bibl Gr xii p    Of the Greek history they made no use because it recorded events which preceded their prophet Mahomet Accustomed to a despotic empire they neglected the political systems of the Greeks which taught republican freedom For the same reasons they despised the eloquence of the Athenian orators The Greek ethics were super  eded by their Alcoran and on this account they did not study the works of Plato  Yet Reinesius says that about the year they translated Plato into Arabic together with the works of S Austin Ambrose Jerom Leo and Gregory the Great Ubi supr p Leo Africanus mentions among the works of Averroes EXPOSITIONES REIPUBLICAE PLATONIS But he died so late as the year De Med et Philosoph Arab cap xx  Therefore no other Greek books engaged their attention but those which treated of mathematical metaphysical and physical knowledge Mathematics coincided with their natural turn to astronomy and arithmetic Metaphysics or logic suited their speculative genius their love of tracing intricate and abstracted truths and their ambition of being admired for difficult and remote researches Physics in which I include medicine assisted the chemical experiments to which they were so much addicted  The earliest Arab chemist whose writings are now extant was Jeber He is about the seventh century His book called by Golius his Latin translator  Lapis Philosophorum  was written first in Greek and af  erwards translated by its author into Arabic For Jeber was originally a Greek and a christian and afterwards went into Asia and embraced Mohammedism See L  o African lib iii c The learned Boerhaave asserts that many of Jeber's experiments are verified by present practice and that several of them have been revived as modern discoveries Boerhaave adds that except the fancies about the philosopher's stone the exactness of Jeber's operations is suprising Hist Chemistr p Lond  and medicine while it was connected with chemistry and botany was a practical art of immediate utility  Their learning but especially their medical knowledge flourished most in Salerno a city of Italy where it formed the famous  Schola Salernitana  The little book of medical precepts in leonine heroics which bears the name of that school is well known This system was composed at the desire of Robert duke of Normandy William the Conqueror's brother who returning from Jerusalem in one of the crusades and having heard of the fame of those Salernitan physicians applied to them for the cure of a wound made by a poisoned arrow It was written not only in verse but in rhyming verse that the prince might more easily retain the rules in his memory It was published The author's name is Giovanni di Milano a celebrated Salernitan physician The monks of Cassino hereafter mentioned much improved this study See Chron Cassin iii c Medicine was at first practised by the monks or the clergy who adopted it with the rest of the Arabian learning See P Diac De Vir illustr cap xiii et ibid Not Mar See also Ab De Nuce ad Chron Cassin i c And Leon Ostiens Chron iii c See SECT xvii p infr  Hence they studied Aristotle Galen  and Hippocrates with unremitted ardour and assiduity they translated their writings into the Arabic tongue  Compare Renaudot ubi supr p  and by degrees illustrated them with voluminous commentaries  Their caliph Almanun was a singular encourager of these translations He was a great master of the speculative sciences and for his better information in them invited learned men from all parts of the world to Bagdat He favoured the learned of every religion and in return they made him presents of their works collected from the choicest pieces of eastern literature whether of Indians Jews Magians or oriental christians He expended immense sums in purchasing valuable books written in Hebrew Syriac and Greek that they might be translated into Arabic Many Greek treatises of medicine were translated into that language by his orders He hired the most learned persons from all quarters of his vast dominions to make these translations Many celebrated astronomers flourished in his reign and he was himself famed for his skill in astronomy This was about the year of Christ See Leo African de Med et Phil Arab cap i AlMakin p Eutych p  A curious circumstance of the envy with which the Greeks at Constantinople treated this growing philosophy of the Arabians is mentioned by Cedrenus AlManun hearing of one Leo an excellent inathematician at Constantinople wrote to the emperor requesting that Leo might be permitted to settle in his dominions with a most ample salary as a teacher in that science The emperor by this means being made acquainted with Leo's merit established a school in which he appointed Leo a professor for the sake of a specious excuse The caliph sent a second time to the emperor entreating that Leo might reside with him for a short time only offering likewise a large sum of money and terms of lasting peace and alliance On which the emperor immediately created Leo bishop of Thessalonica Cedren Hist Comp seq Herbelot also relates that the same caliph so universal was his search after Greek books procured a copy of Apollonius Pergaeus the mathematician But this copy contained only seven books In the mean time finding by the Introduction that the whole consisted of eight books and that the eighth book was the foundation of the rest and being informed that there was a complete copy in the emperor's library at Constantinople he applied to him for a transcript But the Greeks merely from a principle of jealousy would not suffer the application to reach the  mperor and it did not take effect Biblioth Oriental p col a  These Arabic translations of the Greek philosophers produced new treatises of their own particularly in medicine and metaphysics They continued to extend their conquests and their frequent incursions into Europe before and after the ninth century and their absolute establishment in Spain imported the rudiments of useful knowledge into nations involved in the grossest ignorance and unpossessed of the  means of instruction They founded universities in many cities of Spain and Africa  See Hotting Hist Eccl Saec ix sect ii lit G g According to the best writers of oriental history

which Charlemagne emperor of France and Germany commanded to be translated from Arabic into Latin  Cuspinian de Caesarib p  and which by the care and encouragement of that liberal prince being quickly disseminated over his extensive dominions soon became familiar to the western world Hence it is that we find our early Latin authors of the dark ages chiefly employed in writing systems of the most abstruse sciences and from these beginnings the Aristotelic philosophy acquired such establishment and authority that from long prescription it remains to this day the sacred and uncontroverted doctrine of our schools  Yet it must not be forgot that S Austin had translated part of Aristotle's logic from the original Greek into Latin before the fifth century and that the peripatetic philosophy must have been partly known to the western scholars from the writings and translations of Boethius who flourished about the year Alcuine Charlemagne's master commends S Austin's book De Praedicamentis which he calls DECEM NATURAE VERBA Rog Bacon de Util Scient cap xiv See also Op Maj An ingenious and learned writer already quoted a  ir  s that in the age of Charlemagne there were many Greek scholars who made translations of Aristotle which were in use below the year I will not believe that any Europeans properly so called were competently skilled in Greek for this purpose in the time of Charlemagne nor if they were is it likely that of themselves they should have turned their thoughts to Aristotle's philosophy Unless by  viri Graece d  i  this writer means the learned Arabs of Spain which does not appear from his context See Euseb Renaudot ut supr p  From this fountain the infatuations of astrology took possession of the middle ages and were continued even to modern times To the peculiar genius of this people it is owing that chemistry became blended with so many extravagancies obscured with unintelligible jargon and filled with fantastic notions mysterious  pretensions and superstitious operations And it is easy to conceive that among these visionary philosophers so fertile in speculation logic and metaphysics contracted much of that refinement and perplexity which for so many centuries exercised the genius of profound reasoners and captious disputants and so long obstructed the progress of true knowledge It may perhaps be regretted in the mean time that this predilection of the Arabian scholars for philosophic enquiries prevented them from importing into Europe a literature of another kind But rude and barbarous nations would not have been polished by the history poetry and oratory of the Greeks Although capable of comprehending the solid truths of many parts of science they are unprepared to be impressed with ideas of elegance and to relish works of taste Men must be instructed before they can be refined and in the gradations of knowledge polite literature does not take place till some progress has first been made in philosophy Yet it is at the same time probable that the Arabians among their literary stores brought into Spain and Italy many Greek authors not of the scientific species  It must not be forgot that they translated Aristotle's POETICS There is extant  "Averroys Summa in Aristotelis poetriam ex Arabico sermone in Latinum traducta ab Hermano Alemanno Praemittitur determinatio Ibinrosdin in poetria Aristotelis Venet "  There is a translation of the POETICS into Arabic by Abou Muschar Metta entitled ABOTIKA See Herbel Bibl Oriental p col a p b p col p col Farabi who studied at Bagdad about the year one of the translator's of Aristotle's ANALYTICS wrote sixty books on that philosopher's Rhetoric declaring that he had read it over two hundred times and yet was equally

beautiful and elegant copy I have seen is on vellum in Trinity college library at Oxford Cod MSS Num    and that the migration of this people into the western world while it proved the fortunate instrument of introducing into Europe some of the Greek classics at a very early period was moreover a means of preserving those genuine models of composition and of transmitting them to the present generation  See what I have said concerning the destruction of many Greek classics at Constantinople in the Preface to Theocritus Oxon tom i Prefat p xiv xv To which I will add that so early as the fourth century the christian priests did no small injury to antient literature by prohibiting and discouraging the study of the old pagan philosophers Hence the story that Jerom dreamed he was whipped by the devil for reading Cicero Compare what is said of Livy below  It is certain that about the close of the ninth century polite letters together with the sciences began in some degree to be studied

Ceolfrid Alcuine and Bede with whom I must also join king Alfred But in an enquiry of this nature Alfred deserves particular notice not only as a writer but as the illustrious rival of Charlemagne in protecting and assisting the restoration of literature He is said to have founded the university of Oxford and it is highly probable that in imitation of Charlemagne's similar institutions he appointed learned persons to give public and gratuitous instructions in theology but principally in the fashionable sciences of logic astronomy arithmetic and geometry at that place which was then a considerable town and conveniently situated in the neighbourhood of those royal seats at which Alfred chiefly resided He suffered no priest that was illiterate to be advanced to any ecclesiastical dignity  MS Bever MSS Coll Trin Oxon Codd xlvii f  He invited his nobility to educate their sons in learning and requested those lords of his court who had no children to send to school such of their younger servants as discovered a promising capacity and to breed them to the clerical profession  Bever ibid  Alfred while a boy had himself experienced the inconveniencies arising from a want of scholars and even of common instructors in his dominions for he was twelve years of age before he could procure in the western kingdom a master properly qualified to teach him the alphabet But while yet unable to read he could repeat from memory a great variety of Saxon songs  Flor Vigorn sub ann Brompton Chron in ALFR p And MS Bever ut supr It is curious to observe the simplicity of this age in the method by which Alfred computed time He caused six wax tapers to be made each twelve inches long and of as many ounces in weight on these tapers he ordered the inches to be regularly marked and having found that one of them burned just four hours he committed the care of them to the keepers of his chapel who from time to time gave due notice how the hours went But as in windy weather the candles were more wasted to remedy this inconvenience he invented lanthorns there being then no glass to be met with in his dominions Asser Menev Vit Alfr p edit Wi  e In the mean time and during this

philosophy jejune and their lectures rather served to stop the growth of ignorance than to produce any positive or important improvements in knowledge They were unable to make  xcursions from their circumscribed paths of scientific instruction into the spacious and fruitful regions of liberal and manly study Those of their hearers who had passed through the course of the sciences with applause and aspired to higher acquisitions were exhorted to read Cassiodorus and Boethius whose writings they placed at the summit of profane literature and which they believed to be the great boundaries of human erudition  I have already mentioned Ceolfrid's presents of books to Benedict's library at Weremouth abbey He wrote an account of his travels into France and Italy But his principal work and I believe the only one preserved is his diss  rtation concerning the clerical tonsure and the rites of celebrating Easter  Bed Hist Eccl v And Concil Gen vi p  This was written at the desire of Naiton a

assertion in part at least may justly be doubted His knowledge if we consider his age was extensive and profound and it is amazing in so rude a period and during a life of no considerable length he

of oriental inv  ntion I will give an instance or two A monk of Northumberland di  d and was brought again to life In this interval of death a young man in shining apparel came and led him without speaking to a valley of infinite depth length and breadth one side was formed by a prodigious sheet of fire and the opposite side filled with hail and ice Both sides were swarming with souls o  departed men who were for ever in search of rest alternately shifting their situation to these extremes of heat and cold The monk supposing this place to be hell was told hy his guide that he was mistaken The guide then led him greatly terrified with this spectacle to a more distant place where he says  "I saw on a sudden a darkness come on and every thing was obscured When I entered this place I could discern no object on account of the encreasing darkness except the countenance and glittering garments of my conductor As we went forward I beheld vast torrents of flame spouting upwards from the ground as from a large well and falling down into it again As we came near it my guide suddenly vanished and left me alone in the midst of darkness and this horrible vision Deformed and uncouth spirits arose from this blazing chasm and attempted to draw me in with fiery forks"  But his guide here returned and they all retired at his appearance Heaven is then described with great strength of fancy I have seen an old ballad called the  Dead Man's Song  on this story And Milton's hell may perhaps be taken from this idea Bed Hist Eccl v Our historian in the next chapter relates that two most beautiful youths came to a person lying sick on his deathbed and offered him a book to read richly ornamented in which his good actions were recorded Immediately after this the house was surrounded and filled with an army of spirits of most horrible aspect One of them who by the gloom of his darksome countenance appeared to be their leader produced a book  codic  m horr  ndae visionis

digestion of materials disposition of parts and accuracy of narration in this writer's historical works expects what could not exist at that time He has recorded but few civil transactions but besides that his history professedly considers ecclesiastical affairs we should remember that the building of a church the preferment of an abbot the canonisation of a martyr and the importation into England of the shinbone of an apostle were necessarily matters of much more importance in Bede's conceptions than victories or revolutions He is fond of minute description but particularities are the fault and often the merit of early historians  An ingenious author who writes under the name of M de Vigneul Marville observes that Bede  "when he speaks of the Magi who went to worship our Saviour is very particular in the account of their names age and respective offerings He says that Melchior was old and had grey hair with a long beard and that it was he who offered gold to Christ in acknowledgment of his sovereignty That Gaspar the second of the magi was young and had no beard and that it was he who offered frankincense in recognition of our Lord's divinity and that Balthasar the third was of a dark complexion had a large beard and offered myrrh to our Saviour's humanity"  He is likewise very circumstantial in the description of their dresses Melanges d' l'Hist et de Lit Paris mo tom iii p c

that their Grecian literature was a matter of ostentation rather than use William of Malmesbury in his life of Aldhelm censures an affectation in the writers of this age that they were fond of

esteemed a knowledge of that language Eginhart relates that Charlemagne could speak Latin as fluently as his native Frankish but slightly passes over his accomplishment in Greek by artfully saying that he understood it better than he could pronounce it  Vit Kar Magn p  Nor by the way was Charlemagne's boasted facility in the Latin so remarkable a prodigy The Latin language was familiar to the Gauls when they were conquered by the Franks for they were a province of the Roman empire till the year It was the language of their religious offices their laws and public transactions The Franks who conquered the Gauls at the period just mentioned still continued this usage imagining there was a superior dignity in the language of imperial Rome although this incorporation of the Franks with the Gauls greatly corrupted the latinity of the latter and had given it a strong tincture of barbarity before the reign of Charlemagne But while we are bringing proofs which tend to extenuate the notion that Greek was now much known or cultivated it must not be dissembled that John Erigena a native of Aire in Scotland and one of king Alfred's first lecturers at Oxford  Wood Hist Antiquit Univ Oxon i

Alfred who encouraged learning by his own example by founding  eminaries of instruction and by rewarding the labours of scholars But the efforts of this pious monarch were soon blasted by the supineness of his successors the incursions of the Danes and the distraction of national affairs Bede from the establishment of learned bishops in every diocese and the universal tranquillity which reigned over all the provinces of England when he finished his ecclesiastical history flatters his imagination in anticipating  the most advantageous consequences and triumphantly closes his narrative with this pleasing presentiment The Picts at this period were at peace with the Saxons or English and converted to christianity The Scots lived contented within their own boundary The Britons or Welsh

Northumbrians both the nobility and private persons rather chose their children should receive the monastic tonsure than be trained to arms  Bede Eccl Hist v    But a long night of confusion and gross ignorance succeeded The principal productions of the most eminent monasteries for three centuries were incredible legends which discovered no marks of invention unedifying homilies and trite

the Normans the rudiments of that cultivation which it has preserved to the present times The Normans were a people who had acquired ideas of splendor and refinement from their residence in France and the gallantries of their f  udal system introduced new magnificence and elegance among our rough unpolished ancestors The conqueror's army was composed of the flower of the Norman nobility who sharing allotments of land in different parts of the new territory diffused a general knowledge of various improvements entirely unknown in the most flourishing eras of the Saxon government and gave a more liberal turn to the manners even of the provincial inhabita  ts That they brought with them the arts may yet be seen by the castles and churches which they built on a more extensive and stately plan  This point will be further illustrated in a work now preparing for the press entitled OBSERVATIONS CRITICAL AND HISTORICAL ON CASTLES CHURCHES MONASTERIES and other MONUM  NTS O  ANTIQUITY IN VARIOUS P  RTS OF ENGLAND To which will be prefixed THE HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE IN ENGLAND  Literature in particular the chief object of our present research which had long been reduced to the most abject condition appeared with new lustre in consequence of this important revolution  Towards the close of the tenth century an event took place which gave a new and very fortunate turn to the state of letters in France and Italy A little before that time there were no schools in Europe but those whic  belonged to the monasteries or episcopal churches and the monks were almost the only masters employed to educate the youth in the principles of sacred and profane erudition But at the commencement of the eleventh century many learned persons of the laity as well as of the clergy undertook in th  most capital cities of France and Italy this important charge The Latin versions of the Greek philosophers from the Arabic had now become so frequent and common as to fall into the hands of the people and many of these new preceptors having travelled into Spain with a design of studying in the Arabic schools  This fashion continued for a long time Among many who might here be mentioned was Daniel Merlac an Englishman who in the year went to Toledo to learn mathematics and brought back with him into England several books of the Arabian philosophy Wood Antiq Univ Oxon i p col i  and

education of youth were imported into England by means of the Norman conquest  The conqueror himself patronised and loved letters He filled the bishopricks and abbacies of England with the most learned of his countrymen who had been educated at the university of Paris at that time the most flourishing school in Europe He placed Lanfranc abbot of the monastery of Saint Stephen at Caen in the see of Canterbury an eminent master of logic the subtleties of which he employed with great dexterity in a famous controversy concerning the real presence Anselm an acute metaphysician and theologist his immediate successor in the same see was called from the government of the abbey of Bec in Normandy Herman a Norman bishop of Salisbury founded a noble library in the antient cathedral of that see

and literary leisure while they diffused an air of civility and softened the manners of the people in their respective circles must have afforded powerful invitations to studious pursuits and have consequently added no small degree of stability to the interests of learning  By these observations and others which have occurred in the course of our enquiries concerning the utility of monasteries I certainly do not mean to defend the monastic system We are apt to pass a general and undistinguishing censure on the monks and to suppose their foundations to have been the retreats of illiterate indolence at every period of time B  t it should be remembered that our universities about the time of the Norman conquest were in a low condition while the monasteries contained ample endowments and accommodations and were the only respectable seminaries of literature A few centuries afterwards as our universities began to flourish in consequence of the distinctions and  onours which they conferred on scholars the establishment of colleges the introduction of new systems of science the universal ardour which prevailed of breeding almost all persons to letters and the abolition of that exclusive right of teaching which the ecclesiastics had so long claimed the monasteries of course grew inattentive to studies which were more strongly encouraged more commodiously pursued and more successfully cultivated in other places they gradually became contemptible and unfashionable as nurseries of learning and their fraternities degenerated into sloth and ignorance The most eminent scholars which England produced both in philosophy and humanity before and even below the twelfth century were educated in our religious houses The encouragement given in the English monasteries for transcribing books the scarcity of which in the middle ages we have before remarked was very considerable In every great abbey there was an apartment called the SCRIPTORIUM where many writers were constantly busied in transcribing not only the servicebooks for the choir but books for the library  This was also a practice in the monasteries abroad in which the boys and novices were chiefly

writing Epistles which appears to have been a favourite  subject  See what is said of John Hanvill below  He died in  Lel Script Brit  p  About the same time Robert Dunstable a monk of Saint Alban's

CLAUD E  There are more of his Latin poems on sacred  ubjects in the British Museum But most of them are of an inferior composition and as I suppose of another hand  The first book is opened thus  Albani celebrem caelo terrisque triumphum  Ruminat inculto carmine Clio rudis  We are not to expect Leonine rhymes in these writers which became fashionable some years afterwards  Leonine verses are said to have been invented and first used by a French monk of Saint Victor at Marseilles named Leoninus or Leonine about the year Pasquier Recherch de la France vii p p It is however certain that rhymed Latin verses were in use much earlier I have before observed that the  Schola Salernitana  was published See Massieu Hist Fr Poes p Fauchett Rec p seq And I have seen a Latin poem of four hundred lines  "Moysis Mutii Bergomatis de rebus Bergomensibus Justiniani hujus nominis secundi Byzantii Imperato  is jussu conscrip  um anno a salute nostra "  The author was the emperor's scribe or secretary It begins thus  Alme Deus rector qui mundi regna gubernas  Nec sinis absque modo sedes fluitare supernas  It is at the end of  "Achillis Mutii theatrum Bergomi typis Comini Venturac "  Pelloutier has given a very early specim  n of Latin Rhymes Mem sur la Lang Celt part i vol i ch xii p He quotes th  writer of the life of S Faron who relates that Clotarius the second having conquered the Saxons in the beginning of the sevent  century commanded a Latin panegyrical song to be composed on that occasion  hich was sung all over France It is somewhat in the measure of their vernacular poetry  at that time made to be sung to the harp  and begins with this stanza  De Clotario est c  nere rege Francoru  Qui ivit pug  are cum gente Saxonum  Quam graviter provenisset mi  is Saxo nu  Si non fuisset inclitu  Faro de gente Burgundionum  Latin rhymes seem to have been first used in the churchhymns But Leonine verse  are properly the Roman hexamet  rs or pe  tameters rhymed And it is not improbab  e that they took their name from the monk abovementioned who was the most popular  nd almost only Latin poet of his time in France He wrote many Latin pie  es not in rhyme and in a good style of Latin ver  ification Particularly a Latin heroi  poem in twelve books containing the history of the bible from th  creation of the world to the story of Ruth Also some elegies  which have a tolerable degree of classic purity Some suppose that pope Leo the second about the year a great reformer of the chants and hymns of the church invented this sort of verse  It is remarkable that Bede who lived in the eigh  h century in his book  E ART  M  TRICA does not see  to have know  that rhyme was a common ornament of the church hymns of his time many of which he quotes See Opp tom i  cap penult But this chapter I think is all take  rom Marius Victorinus a much older writer The hymns which Bede quotes are extremely barbarous consisting of a modulated structure or a certain number of fee  without quantity like the odes of the minstrels or scalds of that age  "Ut sunt he says carmina VULGARIUM POETARUM"  In the mean time we must not forget that the early French troubadours mention a sort of rhyme in their vernacular poetry partly distinguished from the common species which they call Leonine or Leonime Thus Gualtier Arbalestrier de Belleperche in the beginning of his romance of Judas Maccabeus written before the year  Je ne di pas k' aucun biau dit  Ni mette par faire la ryme  Ou  conson  nte  ou  leonime  But enough has been said on a subject of so little importance  Their  verses are of a higher cast and have a classical turn The following line which begins the second book is remarkably flowing and harmonious and much in the manner of Claudian  Pieridum studiis claustri laxare rigorem  Smoothness of versification was an excellence which like their Saxon predecessors they studied to a fault Henry of Huntingdon commonly known and

Praef p xii  His merits as an historian have been justly displayed and recommended by lord Lyttelton  In his History of Henry the second  But his abilities were not confined to prose He wrote many

commotions which disquieted the reign of king Stephen found leisure and opportunity to protect and promote literary merit  See Cave Hist Lit p  Till Malmesbury's works appeared Bede had been the chief and principal writer of English history But a general spirit of writing history owing to that curiosity which more polished manners introduce to an acquaintance with the antient historians and to the improved knowledge of a language in which facts could be recorded with grace and dignity was now prevailing Besides those I have mentioned Simeon of Durham Roger Hoveden and Benedict abbot of Peterborough are historians whose narratives have a liberal cast and whose  details rise far above the dull uninteresting precision of patient annalists and regular chronologers John Hanvill a monk of Saint Alban's about the year studied rhetoric at Paris and was distinguished for his taste even among the numerous and polite scholars of that flourishing seminary  Lel p  His ARCHITRENIUS is a learned ingenious and very entertaining performance It is a long Latin poem in nine books dedicated to Walter bishop of Rouen The design of the work may be partly conjectured from its affected Greek title but it is on the whole a mixture of satire and panegyric on public vice and virtue with some historical digressions In the exordium is the following nervous and spirited address  Tu Cyrrhae

description and which could only flow from a cultivated mind  "In the deep vale of Ewias which is about a bowshot over and enclosed on all sides with high mountains stands the abbey church of saint John a structure covered with lead and not unhandsomely built for so lonesome a situation on the very spot where formerly stood a small chapel dedicated to saint David which had no other ornaments than green moss and ivy It is a situation fit for the exercise of religion and a religious edifice was first founded in this sequestered retreat to the honour of a solitary life by two hermits remote from the noise of the world upon the banks of the river Hondy which winds through the midst of the valleyThe rains which mountainous countries usually produce are here very frequent the winds exceedingly tempestuous and the winters almost  continually dark Yet the air of the valley is so happily tempered as scarcely to be the cause of any diseases The monks sitting in the cloisters of the abbey when they chuse for a momentary refreshment to cast their eyes abroad have on every side a pleasing prospect of mountains ascending to an immense height with numerous herds of wild deer feeding aloft on the highest extremity of this lofty horizon The body of the sun is not visible above the hills till after the meridian hour even when the air is most clear"  Giraldus adds that Roger bishop of Salisbury prime minister to Henry the first having visited this place on his return to court told the king that all the treasure of his majesty's kingdom would not suffice to build such another cloister The bishop explained him  elf by saying that he meant the circular ridge of mountains with which the vale of Ewias was enclosed  Girald Cambrens ITIN CAMB  Lib i c p seq Lond mo  Alexander

enquiry this promising dawn of polite letters and rational knowledge was soon obscured The temporary gleam of light did not arrive to perfect day The minds of scholars were diverted from these liberal studies in the rapidity of their career and the arts of composition and the ornaments of language were neglected to make way for the barbarous and barren subtleties of scholastic divinity The first teachers of this art originally founded on that spirit of intricate and metaphysical enquiry which the Arabians had communicated to philosophy and which now became almost absolutely necessary for defending the doctrines of Rome were Peter Lombard archbishop of Paris and the celebrated Abelard men whose consummate abilities were rather qualified to reform the church and to restore useful science than to corrupt both by confounding the common sense of mankind with frivolous speculation  They both flourished about the year  These visionary theologists never explained or illustrated any scriptural topic on the contrary they perverted the simplest expressions of the sacred text and embarrassed the most evident truths of the gospel by laboured distinctions and unintelligible solutions From the universities of France which were then filled with multitudes of English students this admired species of sophistry was adopted in England and encouraged by Lanfranc and Anselm archbishops of Canterbury  "Baccalaureus qui legit textum sc S Scripturae succumbit lectori SENTENTIARUM Parisiis c"  Rog Bacon ap  d A Wood Hist Antiq Univ Oxon i p  Lombard was the author of the  Sente  ces  And so successful was its progress at Oxford that before the reign of Edward the second no foreign university could boast so conspicuous a catalogue of subtle and invincible doctors  Nor was the profession of the civil and canonical laws a small impediment to the propagation of those letters which humanise the mind and cultivate the manners I do not mean to deny that the accidental discovery of the imperial code in the twelfth century contributed in a considerable degree to civilise Europe by introducing among other beneficial consequences more legitimate ideas concerning the nature of government and the administration of justice by creating a necessity of transferring judicial decrees from an illiterate nobility to the cognisance of scholars by lessening the attachment to the military profession and by giving honour and importance to civil employments but to suggest that the mode in which this invaluable system of jurisprudence was studied proved injurious to polite literature It was no sooner revived than it was received as a scholastic science and taught by regular professors in most of the universities of Europe To be skilled in the theology of the schools was the chief and general ambition of scholars but at the same time a knowledge of both the laws was become an indispensable requisite at least an essential recommendation for obtaining the most opulent ecclesiastical dignities Hence it was cultivated with universal avidity It became so considerable a branch of study in the plan of academical discipline that twenty scholars out of seventy were destined to the study of the civil and canon laws in one of the most ample colleges at Oxford founded in the year And it is easy to conceive the pedantry with which it was pursued in these seminaries during the middle ages It was treated with the same spirit of idle speculation which had been carried into philosophy and theology it was overwhelmed with endless commentaries which disclaimed all elegance of language and served only to exercise genius as it afforded materials for framing the flimsy labyrinths of casuistry  It was not indeed probable that these attempts in elegant literature which I have mentioned should have any permanent effects The change like a sudden revolution in government was too rapid for duration It was moreover premature and on that account not likely to be lasting The habits of superstition and ignorance were as yet too powerful for a reformation of this kind to be effected by a few polite scholars It was necessary that many circumstances and events yet in the womb of time should take place before the minds of men could be so far enlightened as to receive these improvements  But perhaps inventive poetry lost nothing by this relapse Had classical taste and judgment been now established imagination would have suffered and too early a check would have been given to the beautiful extravagancies of romantic fabling In a word truth and reason would have chased before their time those spectres of illusive fancy so pleasing to the imagination which delight to hover in the gloom of ignorance and superstition and which form so considerable a part of the poetry of the succeeding centuries  THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY  SECT I  THE Saxon language spoken in England is distinguished by three several epochs and may therefore be divided into three dialects The first of these is that which the Saxons used from their entrance into this island till the irruption of the Danes for the space of three hundred and thirty years  The Saxons came into England A D  This has been called the British Saxon and no monument of it remains except a small metrical fragment of the genuine Caedmon inserted in Alfred's version of the Venerable Bede's

language extremely barbarous irregular and intractable and consequently promises no very striking specimens in any species of composition Its substance was the Danish Saxon adulterated with French The Saxon indeed a language subsisting on uniform principles and polished by poets and theologists however corrupted by the Danes had much perspicuity strength and harmony but the French imported by the Conqueror and his people was a confused jargon of Teutonic Gaulish and vitiated Latin In this fluctuating state of our national speech the French predominated Even before the conquest the Saxon language began to fall into contempt and the French or Frankish to be substituted in its stead a circumstance which at once facilitated and foretold the Norman accession In the year it was the common practice of  the AngloSaxons to send their youth to the monasteries of France for education  Dugd Mon i  and not only the language but the manners of the French were esteemed the most polite accomplishments  Ingulph Hist p sub ann  In the reign of Edward the Confessor the resort of Normans to the English court was so frequent that the affectation of imitating the Frankish customs became almost universal and even the lower class of people were ambitious of catching the Frankish idiom It was no difficult task for the Norman lords to banish that language of which the natives began to be absurdly ashamed The new invaders commanded the laws to be administered in French  But there is a precept in Saxon from William the first to the sheriff of Somersetshire Hickes Thes i par i pag See

to the Saxon tongue  The Normans who practiced every specious expedient to plunder the monks demanded a sight of the written evidences of their lands The monks well knew that it would have been useless or impolitic to have produced these evidences or charters in the original Saxon as the Normans not only did not understand but would have received with contempt instruments written in that language Therefore the monks were compelled to the pious fraud of forging them in Latin and great numbers of these forged Latin charters till lately supposed original are still extant See Spelman in

before the reign of Edward the third but of a few types only  Yet this is almost a single example That monarch's motive was perhaps political and he seems to have practised this expedient with a view of obliging his queen who was of Saxon lineage or with a design of flattering his English subjects and of securing his title already strengthened by a Saxon match in consequence of so specious and popular an artifice It was a common and indeed a very natural practice for the transcribers of Saxon books to change the Saxon orthography for the Norman and to substitute in the place of the original

were ordered to converse in French or Latin  In the statutes of Oriel College in Oxford it is ordered that the scholars or fellows  "siqua inter se proferant colloquio Latino vel saltem Gallico perfruantur"  See Hearne's Trokelowe pag These statutes were given Maii A D I find much the same injunction in the statutes of Exeter College Oxford given about Where they are ordered to use  "Romano aut Gallico saltem sermone"  Hearne's MSS Collect num pag Bibl Bodl But in Merton College statutes mention is made of the Latin only In cap x They were given This was also common in the greater monasteries In the register of Wykeham bishop of Winchester the domicellus of the Prior of S Swythin's at Winchester is ordered to address the bishop on a certain occasion in French A D Registr Par iii fol  The latter was much affected by the Normans All the Norman accompts were in Latin The plan of the great royal revenuerolls now called the piperolls were of their construction and in that language But from the declension of the barons and prevalence of the commons most of whom were of English ancestry the native language of England gradually gained ground till at length the interest of the commons  o far succeeded with Edward the third that an act of parliament was passed appointing all pleas and proceedings of law to be carried on in English  But the French formularies and terms of law and particularly the French feudal phraseology had taken too deep root to be thus hastily abolished Hence long after the reign of Edward the third many of our lawyers composed their tracts in French And reports and some statutes were made in that language See Fortescut de Laud Leg Angl cap xlviii  although the same statute decrees  in the true Norman spirit that all such pleas and proceedings should be enrolled in Latin  Pulton's Statut Edw iii This was A D The first English instrument in Rymer is dated Foed vii p  Yet this change did not restore either the Saxon alphabet or language It abolished a token of subjection and disgrace and in some degree contributed to prevent further French innovations in the language then used which yet remained in a compound state and retained a considerable mixture of foreign phraseology In the mean time it must be remembered that this corruption of the Saxon was not only owing to the admission of new words occasioned by the new alliance but to changes of its own forms and terminations arising from reasons which we cannot investigate or explain  This subject will be further illustrated in the next section    Among the manuscripts of Digby in the Bodleian library at Oxford we find a religious or moral Ode consisting of one hundred and ninetyone stanzas which the learned Hickes places just after the conquest  Ling Vett Thes Part i p There is another copy not mentioned by Hickes in Jesus College library at Oxford MSS infr citat This is entitled  Tractatus guidam in Anglico  The Digby manuscript has no title  but as it contains few Norman terms I am inclined to think it of rather higher antiquity In deference however to so great an authority I am obliged to mention it here and especially as it exhibits a regular lyric strophe of four lines the second and fourth of which rhyme together Although these four lines may be perhaps resolved into two Alexandrines a measure concerning which more will be said hereafter and of which it will be sufficient to remark at present that it appears to have been used very early For I cannot recollect any strophes of this sort in the elder Runic or Saxon poetry nor in any of the old Frankish poems particularly of Otfrid a monk of Weissenburgh who turned the evangelical history into Frankish verse about the ninth century and has left several  hymns in that language  See Petr Lambec Comment de Bibl Caesar Vindebon pag  of Stricker who celebrated the atchievements of Charlemagne  See Petr Lambec ubi supr lib ii cap There is a circumstance belonging to the antient Frankish versification which as it greatly illustrates the subject of alliteration deserves notice here Otfrid's dedication of his Evangelical history to Lewis the first king of the oriental France consists of four lined stanzas in rhyming couplets but the first and last line of every stanzas begin and end with the same letter and the letters of the title of the dedication respectively and the word of the last line of every tetrastic Flaccus Illyrius published this work of Otfrid at Basil But I think it has been since more correctly printed by Johannes Schilterus It was written about the year Otfrid was the disciple of Rhabanus Maurus  and of the anonymous author of the metrical life of Anno archbishop of Cologn The following stanza is a specimen  St xiv    Sende god biforen him man  þe hƿile he mai to heuene  For betere is on elmesse biforen  Danne ben after  euene  This is perhaps the true reading from the Trinity manuscript at Cambridge written about the reign of Henry the second or Richard the first Cod membran vo Tractat I See Abr Wheloc Eccles Hist Bed p  Sende God biforen him man  The while he may to hevene  For betere is on elmesse biforen  Thanne ben after sevene  MSS Digb A membran    That is  "Let a man send his good works before him to heaven while he can for one almsgiving before death is of more value than seven afterwards"  The verses perhaps might have been thus written as two Alexandrines  Send God biforen him man the while he may to hevene  For betere is on almesse biforen than ben after sevene  As I recollect the whole poem is thus exhibited in the Trinity manuscript    Yet alternate rhyming applied without regularity and as rhymes accidentally presented themselves was not uncommon in our early poetry as will appear from other examples  Hickes has printed a satire on the monastic profession which clearly exemplifies the Saxon adulterated by the Norman and was evidently written soon after the conquest at  least before the reign of Henry the second The poet begins with describing the land of indolence or luxury  Fur in see bi west Spaynge  Is a lond ihote Cokaygne  Ther nis lond under hevenriche  Heaven Sax  Of wel of godnis hit iliche  Thoy paradis bi miri  Merry chearful  "Although Paradise is chearful and bright  Cokayne  is a much more beautiful place"  and brigt  Cokaygn is of fairir sigt  What is ther in

the following lines there is a vein of satirical imagination and some talent at description The luxury of the monks is represented under the idea of a monastery constructed of various kinds of delicious and costly viands  Ther is a wel fair abbei  Of white monkes and of grei  Ther beth boures and halles  All of pasteus beth the walles  Of fleis of fisse and a rich met  The likefullist that

"GLOUCESTERSCIRE Berdic Joculator Regis habet iii villas et ibi v car nil redd"  See Anstis Ord Gart ii    Another Norman Saxon poem cited by the same industrious antiquary is entitled THE LIFE OF SAINT MARGARET The structure of its versification considerably differs from that in the lastmentioned piece and is like the French Alexandrines But I am of opinion that a pause or division was intended in the middle of every verse and in this respect its versification resembles also that of ALBION'S ENGLAND or Drayton's POLYOLBION which was a species very common about the reign of queen Elisabeth  It is worthy of remark that we find in the collection of ancient northern monuments published by M Biorner a poem of some length said by that author to have been composed in the twelfth or thirteenth century This poem is professedly in rhyme and the measure like that of the heroic Alexandrine of the French poetry See Mallet's Introd Dannem c ch xiii  The rhymes are also continued to every fourth line It appears to have been written about the time of the crusades It begins thus  Olde ant  And Fr  yonge I priet  I direct Fr  "I advise you your c"  ou our folies for to lete

by Hickes from a manuscript in Trinity college library at Cambridge It seems to belong to the manuscript metrical LIVES OF THE SAINTS  The same that are mentioned by Hearne from a manuscript of Ralph Sh  idon See Hearne's Petr Langt p Saint Winifred's Life is printed from the same collection by bishop Fleetwood in his  Life and Miracles of S  inifred  p ed  which form a very considerable volume and were probably translated or paraphrased from Latin or French prose into English rhyme before  the year  It is in fact a metrical history of the festivals of the whole year The life of the respective Saint is described under every Saints day and the institutions of some sundays and feasts not taking their rise from saints are explained on the plan of the  Legenda Aurea  written by Jacobus de Voragine archbishop of Genoa about the year from which Caxton through the medium of a French version entitled  Legend Doré    translated his  Golden Legend  The  Festival  or  Fe  iall  printed by Wynkin de Worde is a book of the same sort yet with homilies intermixed See MSS Harl fol and to and to and to and seq Manuscript lives of Saints detached and not belonging to this collection are frequent in libraries The  Vitae Patrum  were originally drawn from S Jerome and Johannes Cassianus In Gresham college library are metrical lives of ten Saints chiefly from the  Golden Legend  by Osberne Bokenham an Augustine canon in the abbey of Stokeclare in Suffolk transcribed by Thomas Burgh at Cambridge The Life of S Katharine appears to have been composed in MSS Coll Gresh The French translation of the  L  g  nda Aurea  was made by Jehan de Vignay a monk soon after  We are sure that they were written after the year as they contain the LIFE of Saint Thomas of Becket  Ashmole cites this Life Instit Ord Gart p And he cites S Brandon's Life p Ashmole's manuscript was in the hands of Silas Taylor It is now in his Museum at Oxford MSS Ashm  In the Bodleian library are three manuscript copies of these LIVES OF THE SAINTS  MSS Bodl Laud L And they make a considerable part of a prodigious folio volume beautifully written on vellum and elegantly illuminated where they have the following title which also comprehends other antient English religious poems  "Here begynnen the tytles of the book that is cald in Latyn tonge SALUS ANIME and in Englysh tonge SOWLEHELE"  It was given to the Bodleian library by Edward Vernon esquire soon after the civil war I shall cite it under the title of MS Vernon Although pieces not absolutely religious are sometimes introduced the scheme of the compiler or transcriber seems to have been to form a complete body of legendary and scriptural history in verse or rather to collect into one view all the religious poetry he could find Accordingly the  Lives of the Saints  a distinct and large work of itself properly constituted a part of his plan There is another copy of the  Lives of the Saints  in the British Museum MSS Harl And in Ashmole's Museum MSS Ashm ut supr I think this manuscript is also in Ben  college library The Lives seem to be placed according to their respective festivals in the course of the year The Bodleian copy marked is a thick folio containing leaves The variations in these manuscripts seem chiefly owing to the transcribers The  Life  of Saint Margaret in MSS Bodl begins much like that of Trinity

martyred in the latter part of the reign of Henry the second from historical evidence and as from various internal marks the language of these legends cannot be older than the twelfth century I think we may fairly pronounce the LIVES OF THE SAINTS to have been written about the reign of Richard the first  Who died In the Cotton library I find the lives of Saint Josaphas and Saint Dorman where the

this time See MSS Harl f membr fol  upr citat p    These metrical narratives of christian faith and perseverance seem to have been chiefly composed for the pious amusement and perhaps edification of

improbable that the novices were exercised in reciting portions from these pieces In the British Museum  MSS Harl The dialect is perfectly northern  there is a set of legendary tales in rhyme which appear to have been  olemnly pronounced by the priest to the people on sundays and holidays This sort of poetry  That legends of Saints were sung to the harp at feasts appears from  The Life of Saint

were fond of multiplying the same final sound to the most tedious monotony and without producing any effect of  legance strength or harmony It begins thus  Man og to luuen that rimes ren  The wissed

Harleian volume to which we are so largely indebted has preserved a moral tale a Comparison between age and youth where the stanza is remarkably constructed The various sorts of versification which we

This mode of writing is not uncommon in antient manuscripts of French poetry And some critics may be inclined to suspect that the verses which we call Alexandrine accidentally assumed their form merely from the practice of absurd transcribers who frugally chose to fill their pages to the extremity and violated the metrical structure for the sake  of saving their vellum It is certain that the common stanza of four short lines may be reduced into two Alexandrines and on the contrary I have before observed that the Saxon poem cited by Hickes consisting of one hundred and ninety one stanzas is written in stanzas in the Bodleian and in Alexandrines in the Trinity manuscript at Cambridge How it came originally from the poet I will not pretend to determine  Our early poetry often appears in satirical pieces on the established and eminent professions And the writers as we have already seen succeeded not amiss when they cloathed their satire in allegory But nothing can be conceived more scurrilous and illiberal than their satires when they descend to mere invective In the British Museum among other examples which I could mention we have a satirical ballad on the lawyers  MSS ut sup  f b  and another on the clergy or rather some particular bishop The latter begins thus  Hyrdmen hatieth ant vch mones hyne  For ever uch a parosshe heo polketh in pyne  Ant clastreth wyf heore celle  Nou wol vch fol clerc that is fayly  Wend to the bysshop ant bugge bayly  Nys no wyt in is nolle  Ibid f    The elder French poetry abounds in allegorical satire and I doubt not that the author of the satire on the monastic profession cited above copied some French satire on the subject Satire was one species of the poetry of the Provencial troubadours Anselm Fayditt a troubadour of the eleventh century who will again be mentioned wrote a sort of satirical drama called the HERESY of the FATHERS HEREGIA DEL PREYRES a ridicule on the council which condemned the Albigenses The papal legates often fell under  the lash of these poets whose favour they were obliged to court but in vain by the promise of ample gratuities  Fontenelle Hist Theatr Fr p  dit  Hugues de Bercy a French monk wrote in the twelfth century a very lively and severe satire in which no person not even himself was spared and which he called the BIBLE as containing nothing but truth  See Fauchett Rec p    In the Harleian manuscripts I find an ancient French poem yet respecting England which is a humorous panegyric on a new religious order called LE ORDRE DE BEL EYSE This is the exordium  Qui vodra a moi entendre  Oyr purra e aprendre  L'estoyre de un ORDRE NOVEL  Qe mout est delitous bel  The poet ingeniously feigns that his new monastic order consists of the most eminent nobility and gentry of both sexes who inhabit the monasteries assigned to it promiscuously and that no person is excluded from this establishment who can support the rank of a gentleman They are bound by their statutes to live in perpetual idleness and luxury and the satyrist refers them for a pattern or rule of practice in these important articles to the monasteries of Sempringham in Lincolnshire Beverley in Yorkshire the Knights Hospitalers and many other religious orders then flourishing in England  MSS ibid f    When we consider the feudal manners and the magnificence of our Norman ancestors their love of military glory the enthusiasm with which they engaged in the crusades and the wonders to which they must have been familiarised from those eastern enterprises we naturally suppose what will hereafter be more particularly proved that their retinues  abounded with minstrels and harpers and that their chief entertainment was to listen to the recital of romantic and martial adventures But I have been much disappointed in my searches after the metrical tales which must have prevailed in their times Most of those old heroic songs are perished together with the stately castles in whose halls they were sung Yet they are not so totally lost as we may be apt to imagine Many of them still partly exist in the old English metrical romances which will be mentioned in their proper places yet divested of their original form polished in their style adorned with new incidents successively modernised by repeated transcription and recitation and retaining little more than the outlines of the original composition This has not been the case of the legendary and other religious poems written soon after the conquest manuscripts of which abound in our libraries From the nature of their subject they were less popular and common and being less frequently recited became less liable to perpetual innovation or alteration  The most antient English metrical romance which I can discover is entitled the GESTE OF KING HORN It was evidently written after the crusades had begun is mentioned by Chaucer  Rim Thop Urr  and probably still remains in its original state I will first give the substance of the story and afterwards add some specimens of the composition But I must premise that this story occurs in very old French metre in the manuscripts of the British Museum  MSS Harl b f Cod membr  so that probably it is a translation a circumstance which will throw light on an argument pursued hereafter proving that most of our metrical romances are translated from the French  Mury king of the Saracens lands in the kingdom of Suddene where he kills the king named Allof The queen Godylt escapes but Mury seizes on her son Horne a beautiful  youth aged fi  teen years and puts him into a galley with two of his playfellows Achulph and Fykenyld the vessel being driven on the coast of the kingdom of Westnesse the young prince is found by Aylmar king of that country brought to court and delivered to Athelbrus his steward to be educated in hawking harping tilting and other courtly accomplishments Here the princess Rymenild falls in love with him declares her passion and is betrothed Horne in consequence of this engagement leaves the princess for seven years to demonstrate according to the ritual of chivalry that by seeking and accomplishing dangerous enterprises he deserved her affection He proves a most valorous and invincible knight and at the end of seven years having killed king Mury recovered his father's kingdom and atchieved many signal exploits recovers the princess Rymenild from the hands of his treacherous knight and companion Fykenyld carries her in triumph to his own country and there reigns with her in great splendor and prosperity The poem itself begins and proceeds thus  Alle heo ben blythe that to my songe ylythe  Listen    A songe yet ulle ou singe of Alloff the god kynge  Kynge he was by weste the whiles hit y leste  And Godylt his gode quene no feyrore myhte

and ye shall here    It is the force of the story in these pieces that chiefly engages our attention The minstrels had no idea of conducting and describing a delicate situation The general manners were gross and the arts of writing unknown Yet this simplicity sometimes pleases more than the most artificial touches In the mean time the pictures of antient manners presented by these early writers strongly interest the imagination especially as having the same uncommon merit with the pictures of manners in Homer that of being founded in truth and reality and actually painted from the life To talk of the grossness and absurdity of such manners is little to the purpose the poet is only concerned in the justness and faithfulness of the representation  SECT II  HITHERTO we have been engaged in examining the state of our poetry from the conquest to the year or rather afterwards It will appear to have made no very rapid improvement from that period Yet as we proceed we shall find the language losing much of its antient barbarism and obscurity and approaching more nearly to the dialect of modern times  In the latter end of the reign of Henry the third a poem occurs the date of which may be determined with some degree of certainty It is a satirical song or ballad written by one of the adherents of Simon de Montfort earl of Leicester a powerful baron soon after the battle of Lewes which was fought in the year and proved very fatal to the interests of the king In this decisive action Richard king of the Romans his brother Henry the third and prince Edward with many others of the royal party were taken prisoners  I  Sitteth alle stille ant herkeneth to me  The kynge of Alemaigne  The king of the Romans  bi mi leaute  Loyalty    Thritti thousent pound askede he  For te

encouraging Leicester's partisans and diffusing his fction There is some humour in imagining that Richard supposed the windmill to which he retreated to be a fortification and that he believed the sails of it to be military engines In the manuscript from which this specimen is transcribed immediately follows a song in French seemingly written by the same poet on the battle of Evesham fought the following year in which Leicester was killed and his rebellious barons defeated  f It begins  Chaunter mestoit mon ever le voit en un duré langage  Tut en pluraunt fust fet le chaunt de noitre duz

that this ballad on Richard of Alemaigne probably occasioned a statute against libels in the year under the title  "Against slanderous reports or tales to cause discord betwixt king and people  OBSERVATIONS UPON THE STATUTES CHIEFLY THE MORE ANCIENT c edit p  "  That this spirit was growing to an extravagance which deserved to be checked we shall have occasion to bring further proofs  I must not pass over the reign of Henry the third who died in the year without observing that this monarch  entertained in his court a poet with a certain salary whose name was Henry de Avranches  See Carew's Surv Cornw p edit  And although this poet was a Frenchman and most probably wrote in French yet this first instance of an officer who was afterwards yet with sufficient impropriety denominated a  poet laureate  in the English court deservedly claims particular notice in the course of these annals He is called  Master Henry the Versifier  Henry of Huntingdon says that Walo  Versificator  wrote a panegyric on Henry the first And that the same Walo  Versificator  wrote a poem on the park which that king made at Woodstock Apud Leland's Collectan vol ii i edit Perhaps he was in the department of Henry mentioned in the text One Gualo a Latin poet who flourished about this time is mentioned by Bale iii and Pitts p He is commended in the POLICRATICON A copy of his Latin hexametrical satire on the monks is printed by Mathias Flacius among miscellaneous Latin poems  De corrupto Ecclesiae statu  p Basil oct  which appellation perhaps implies a different character from the royal  Minstrel  or  Joculator  The king's treasurers are ordered to pay this  Master Henry  one hundred shillings which I suppose to have been a year's stipend in the year  "Magistro Henrico

by Michael Blaunpayne a native of Cornwall and recited by the author in the presence of Hugh abbot of Westminster Hugh de Mortimer o  icial of the archbishop of Canterbury the bishop elect of Winchester and the bishop of Rochester  MSS Bibl Bodl Arch Bodl in pergam to viz  "Versus magistri Michaelis Cornubi  nsis contra Mag Henricum Abricensem coram dom Hugone abba  e Westmon et aliis"

Camden cites other Latin verses of Michael Blaunpain whom he calls  "Merry Michael the Cornish poet"  Rem p See also p edit He wrote many other Latin pieces both in prose and verse  While we are speaking of the  Versifier  of Henry the third it will not be foreign to add that in the thirtysixth year of the same king forty shillings and one pipe of wine were given to Richard the king's harper and one pipe of wine to Beatrice his wife  Rot Pip an Henr iii  "Et in uno dolio vini empto et dato magistro Ricardo Citharistae regis xl sol per Br Reg Et in uno dolio empto et dato Beatrici uxori ejusdem Ricardi"  But why this gratuity of a pipe of wine should also be made to the wife as well as to the husband who from his profession was a genial character appears problematical according to our present ideas  The first poet whose name occurs in the reign of Edward the first and indeed in these annals is Robert of Glocester a monk of the abbey of Glocester He has left a poem o  considerable length which is a history of England in verse from Brutus to the reign of Edward the first It was evidently written after the year as the poet mentions king Arthur's sumptuous tomb erected in that year before the high altar of Glastenbury church  Pag edit Hearne Oxon  and he declares himself a living witness of the rema  kably dismal weather which distinguished the day on which the battle of Evesham abovementioned was fought in the year  Pag  From these and other circumstances this piece appears to have been composed about the year It is exhibited in the manuscripts is cited by many antiquaries and printed by Hearne in the Alexandrine measure but with equal probability might have been written in fourlined stanzas This rhyming chronicle is totally destitute of art or imagination The author has cloathed the fables of Geoffrey of Monmouth in rhyme which have often a more poetical air in Geoffrey's prose The  language is not much more easy or intelligible than that of many of the Norman Saxon poems quoted in the preceding section it is full of Saxonisms which indeed abound more or less in every writer before Gower and Chaucer But this obscurity is perhaps owing to the western dialect in which our monk of Glocester was educated Provincial barbarisms are naturally the growth of extreme counties and of such as are situated at a distance from the metropolis and it is probable that the Saxon heptarchy which consisted of a cluster of seven independent states contributed to produce as many different provincial dialects In the mean time it is to be considered that writers of all ages and languages have their affectations and singularities which occasion in each a peculiar phraseology  Robert of Gloucester thus describes the sports and solemnities which

painting But there is an effort at poetry in the description of the giant's fall  Tho grislych yal the ssrewe tho that grislych was his bere  He vel doung as a gret ok that bynethe ycorve were  That it thogte that al hul myd the vallynge ssok  Pag    That is  "This cruel giant yelled so horribly and so vehement was his fall that he fell down like an oak cut through at the bottom and all the hill shook while he fell"  But this stroke is copied from Geoffry of Monmouth who tells the same miraculous story and in all the pomp with which it was perhaps dressed up by his favourite fablers  "Exclamavit vero invisus ille et velut quercus ventorum viribus eradicata cum maximo sonitu corruit"  It is difficult to determine which is most blameable the poetical historian or the prosaic poet  It was a tradition invented by the old fablers that giants brought the stones of Stonehenge from the most sequestered deserts of Africa and placed them in Ireland that every stone was washed with juices of herbs and contained a medical power and that Merlin the magician at the request of king Arthur transported them from Ireland and erected them in circles on the plain of Amesbury as a sepulchral monument for the Britons treacherously slain by Hengist This fable is thus delivered without decoration by Robert of Glocester  "Sire kyng quoth Merlin tho suche thynges y wis  "Ne bethe for to schewe nogt but wen gret nede ys  "For gef iche seid in bismare other bute it ned were  "Sone from me he wold wende the gost that doth me lere  If I should say any thing out of wantoness or

Monmouth who had it from the British bards But why should not the testimony of the British bards be allowed on this occasion For they did not invent facts so much as fables In the present case Hengist's massacre in an allowed event Remove all the apparent  iction and the bards only say that an immense pile of stones was raised on the plain of Ambresbury in memory of that event They lived too near the time to forge this origin of Stonehenge The whole story was recent and from the immensity of the work itself must have been still more notorious Therefore their forgery would have been too glaring It may be objected that they were fond of referring every thing stupendous to their favourite hero Arthur This I grant but not when known authenticated facts stood in their way and while the real cause was remembered Even to this day the massacre of Hengist as I have partly hinted is an undisputed piece of history Why should not the other part of the story be equally true Besides the silence of Nennius I am aware that this hypothesis is still attended with many difficulties and improbabilities And so are all the systems and conjectures ever yet framed about this amazing monument It appears to me to be the work of a rude people who had some ideas of art such as we may suppose the Romans left behind them among the Britons In the mean time I do not remember that in the very controverted etymology of the word  Stone  enge  the name of HENGIST has been properly or sufficiently considered    If any thing engages our attention in this passage it is the wildness of the fiction in which however the poet had no share  I will here add Arthur's intrigue with Ygerne  At the fest of Estre tho kyng sende ys sonde  That heo comen alle to London the hey men of this londe

the latter end of the reign of Edward the first many officers of the French king having extorted large sums of  money from the citizens of Bruges in Flanders were murthered and an engagement

 These verses shew the familiarity with which the affairs of France were known in England and display the disposition of the English towards the French at this period It  It appears from this and previous instances that political ballads I mean such as were the vehicles of political satire prevailed much among our early ancestors About the present era we meet with a ballad complaining of the exhorbitant fees extorted and the numerous taxes levied by the king's officers  Ibid f There is a song half Latin and half French much on the same subject Ibid f b  There is a libel remaining written indeed in French Alexandrines on the commission of traylbaston  See Spelman and Dufresne in Voc And Rob Brunne's Chron ed Hearne p  or the justices so denominated by Edward the first during his absence in the French and Scotch wars about the year The author names some of the justices or commissioners now not easily discoverable and says that he served the king both in peace and war in Flanders Gascony and Scotland  MSS Harl ibid f b  There is likewise a ballad against the Scots traitors to Edward the first and taken prisoners at the battles of Dunbar and Kykenclef in and  Ibid f  The licentiousness of their rude manners was perpetually breaking out in these popular pasquins although this species of petulance usually belongs to more polished times  Nor were they less dexterous than daring in publishing their satires to advantage although they did not enjoy the many conveniencies which modern improvements have afforded for the circulation of public abuse In the reign of Henry the sixth to pursue the topic a little lower we find a ballad of this species stuck on the gates of the royal palace severely reflecting on the king and his counsellors then sitting in parliament This piece is preserved in the Ashmolean museum with the following Latin title prefixed  "Copia scedul  e valvis domini regis existentis in parliamento suo tento apud Westmonasterium mense marcii anno regni Henrici sexti vicesimo octavo"  But the antient ballad was often applied to better purposes and it appears from a valuable collection of these little pieces  lately published by my ingenious friend and fellowlabourer doctor Percy in how much more ingenuous a strain they have transmitted to posterity the praises of knightly heroism the marvels of romantic fiction and the complaints of love  At the close of the reign of Edward the first and in the year a poet occurs named Robert Mannyng but more commonly called Robert de Brunne He was a Gilbertine monk in the monastery of Brunne or Bourne near Depyng in Lincolnshire but he had been before professed in the priory of Sixhille a house of the same order and in the same county He was merely a translator He translated

library of doctor N Johnson of Pontefract now perhaps dispersed there was a manuscript on vellum containing a history in old English verse from Brute to the eighteenth year of Edward the second And in that of Basil lord Denbigh a metrical history in English from the same period to Henry  he third Wanly supposed it to have been of the handwriting of the time of Edward the fourth  in a poem commonly entitled ROMAN DE ROIS D'ANGLETERRE It is esteemed one of the oldest of the French romances and begun to be written by Eustace sometimes called Eustache Wistace or Huistace who finished his part under the title of BRUT D'ANGLETERRE in the year Hence Robert de Brunne somewhat inaccurately calls it simply the BRUT  The BRUT OF ENGLAND a prose Chronicle of England sometimes continued as low as Henry the sixth is a common manuscript It was at first translated from a French Chronicle MSS Harl to written in the beginning of the reign of Edward the third I think it is printed by Caxton under the title of  Fructus Temporum  The French have a famous ancient prose romance called BRUT which includes the history of the Sangreal I know not whether it is exactly the same In an old metrical romance

From these passages it appears that Robert of Brunne has scarcely more poetry than Robert of Glocester He has however taken care to acquaint his readers that he avoided  high description and that sort of phraseology which was then used by the minstrels and harpers that he rather aimed to give information than pleasure and that he was more studious of truth than ornament As he intended his chronicle to be sung at least by parts at public festivals he found it expedient to apologise for these deficiencies in the prologue as he had partly done before in his prologue to the MANUAL OF SINS  I mad

Yet it should be remembered that even such a writer as Robert de Brunne uncouth and unpleasing as he naturally seems and chiefly employed in turning the theology of his age into rhyme contributed to form a style to teach expression and to polish his native tongue In the infancy of language and composition nothing is wanted but writers at that period even the most artless have their use  Robert

he translated another of Grosthead's pieces It is called by Leland  Chateau d'Amour  Script Brit p  But in one of the Bodleian manuscripts of this book we have the following title  Romance par Mestre

that the best authors chose to write in French Many of Robert Grosthead's pieces are indeed in Latin yet where the subject was popular and not immediately addressed to learned readers he adopted the Romance or French language in preference to his native English Of this as we have already seen his MANUEL PECHE and his CHATEAU D' AMOUR are sufficient proofs both in prose and verse and his example and authority must have had considerable influence in encouraging this practice Peter Langtoft our Augustine canon of Bridlington not only compiled the large chronicle of England above recited in French but even translated Herbert Boscam's Latin Life of Thomas of Beckett into French rhymes  Pits p Append Who with great probability supposes him to have been an Englishman  John Hoveden a native of London doctor of divinity and chaplain to queen Eleanor mother of Edward the first wrote in French rhymes a book entitled  Rosarium de Nativitate Passione Ascensione Jhesu Christi  MSS Bibl C C C Cant G where it is also called the  Nightingale  Pr  "Alme fesse lit de peresse"  Our author John Hoveden was also skilled in sacred music and a great writer of Latin hymns He died and was buried at Hoveden Pits p Bale v  There is an old French metrical life of Tobiah which the author most probably an Englishman says he undertook at the request of William Prior of Kenilworth in Warwickshire  MSS

king Dermod's expulsion from Ireland and the recovery of his kingdom  Hist Hen ii vol iv p Notes It was translated into prose by Sir George Carew in Q Elisabeth's time this translation was printed by Harris in his HIBERNIA It was probably written about See Ware p And compare Walpole's Anecd Paint Notes The Lambeth manuscript seems to be but a fragment viz MSS Bibl Lamb Hib A See supr p  I could mention many others Anonymous French  pieces both in prose and verse and written about this time are innumerable in our manuscript repositories  I have before hinted that it was sometimes customary to intermix Latin with French As thus  MSS Harl f b  Di  u roy de Mageste  Ob personas trinas  Nostre roy e sa meyne  Ne perire sinas c  Again ibid  f Where a lover an Englishman addresses his mistress who was of Paris  Dum ludis floribus velut lacinia  Le dieu d' amour moi tient en tiel  Angustia  c  Sometimes their poetry was half French and half English As in a song to the holy virgin on our Saviour's passion  Ibid f  Mayden moder milde oyez cel oreysoun  From shome thou me shilde e de ly mal feloun  For love of thine childe me menez de tresoun  Ich wes wod and wilde ore su en prisoun c  In the same manuscript I find a French poem probably written by an Englishman and in the year containing the adventures of Gilote and Johanne two ladies of gallantry in various parts of England and Ireland particularly at Winchester and Pontefract f b The curious reader is also referred to a French poem in which the poet supposes that a minstrel  jugleour  travelling from London cloathed in a rich tabard met the king and his retinue The king asks him many questions particularly his lord's name and the price of his horse The minstrel evades all the king's questions by impertinent answers and at last presumes to give his majesty advice Ibid f b  Yet this fashion proceeded rather from necessity and a principle of convenience than from affectation The vernacular English as I have before remarked was rough and unpolished and although these writers possessed but few ideas of taste and elegance they embraced a foreign tongue almost equally familiar and in which they could convey their sentiments with greater ease grace and propriety It should also be considered that our most eminent scholars received a part of their education at the university of Paris Another and a very material circ  mstance concurred to countenance this fashionable practice of composing in French It procured them readers of rank and distinction The English court for more than two hundred years after the conquest was totally French and our kings either from birth kindred or marriage and from a perpetual intercourse seem to have been more closely connected with France than with England It was however fortunate that these French pieces were written as some of them met  with their translators who perhaps unable to aspire to the praise of original writers at least by this means contributed to adorn their native tongue and who very probably would not have written at all had not original writers I mean their cotemporaries who wrote in French furnished them with models and materials  Hearne to whose diligence even the poetical antiquarian is much obliged but whose conjectures are generally wrong imagines that the old English metrical romance called RYCHARDE CUER DE LYON was written by Robert de Brunne It is at least probable that the leisure of monastic life produced many rhymers From proofs here given we may fairly conclude that the monks often wrote for the minstrels and although our Gilbertine brother of Brunne chose to relate true stories in plain language yet it is reasonable to suppose that many of our antient tales in verse containing fictitious adventures were written although not invented in the religious houses The romantic history of  Guy earl of Warwick  is expressly said on good authority to have been written by Walter of Exeter a Franciscan Friar of Carocus in Cornwall about the year  Carew's Surv Cornw p edit ut supr I suppose Carew means the metrical Romance of GUY But Bale says that Walter wrote  Vitam Guidonis  which seems to imply a prose history x

monks who very naturally sought all opportunities of amusement in their retired and confined situations were fond of admitting the minstrels to their festivals and were hence familiarised to romantic stories Seventy shillings were expended on minstrels who accompanied their songs with the harp at the feast of the installation of Ralph abbot of Saint Augustin's at Canterbury in the year At this magnificent solemnity six thousand guests were present in and about the hall of the abbey  Dec Script p  It was not deemed an occurrence unworthy to be recorded that when Adam de Orleton bishop of Winchester visited his cathedral priory of Saint Swithin in that city a minstrel named Herbert was introduced who sung the  Song of Colbrond  a Danish giant and the tale of  Queen Emma delivered from the ploughshares  in the hall of the prior Alexander de Herriard in the year I will give this very curious article as it appears in an antient register of the priory  "Et cantabat Joculator quidam

them to be nothing more than two indigent ecclesiastics who could only administer spiritual consolation and being consequently disappointed of their mirth beat them and turned them out of the

festival days in the hall after dinner and supper to entertain themselves with songs and other diversions consistent with decency and to recite poems chronicles of kingdoms the wonders of the world together with the like compositions not misbecoming the clerical character I will transcribe his words  "Quando ob dei reverentiam aut sue matris vel alterius fancti cujuscunque tempore yemali ignis

do not remember any such passage in the statutes of preceding colleges in either university But this injunction is afterwards adopted in the statutes of Magdalene college and from thence if I recollect right was copied into those of Corpus Christi Oxford  "  The latter part of this injunction seems to be an explication of the former and on the whole it appears that the  Cantilenae  which the scholars should sing on these occasions were a sort of  Poemata  or poetical Chronicles containing general histories of kingdoms  Hearne thus understood the passage  "The wise founder of New college permitted them metrical chronicles to be sung by the fellows and scholars upon extraordinary days"  Heming Cartul ii APPEND Numb ix § vi p  It is natural to conclude that they preferred pieces

informed by an ingenious lady of the name of Cooper there is an elegy on the death of Henry the first  "wrote immediately after his death the author unknown"  p Lond Pr for T Davies octavo But this piece which has great merit could not have been written till some centuries afterwards From the classical allusions and general colour of the phraseology to say nothing more it with greater probability belongs to Henry the eighth It escaped me till just before this work went to press that Dr Percy had printed this elegy Ball ii    That the pope should here pronounce the funeral panegyric of Edward the first is by no means surprising if we consider the predominant ideas of the age And in the true spirit of these ideas the poet makes this illustrious monarch's atchievements in the holy land his principal and leading topic But there is a particular circumstance alluded to in  these stanzas relating to the crusading character of Edward together with its consequences which needs explanation Edward in the decline of life had vowed a second expedition to Jerusalem but finding his end approach in his last moments he devoted the prodigious sum of thirty thousand pounds to provide one hundred and forty knights  The poet says eighty  who should carry his heart into Palestine But this appointment of the dying king was never executed Our elegist and the chroniclers impute the crime of witholding so pious a legacy to the advice of the king of France whose daughter Isabel was married to the succeeding king But it is more probable to suppose that Edward the second and his profligate minion Piers Gaveston dissipated the money in their luxurious and expensive pleasures  SECT III  WE have seen in the preceding section that the character of our poetical composition began to be changed about the reign of the first Edward that either fictitious adventures were substituted by the minstrels in the place of historical and traditionary facts or reality disguised by the misrepresentations of invention and that a taste for ornamental and even exotic expression gradually prevailed over the rude simplicity of the native English phraseology This change which with our language affected our poetry had been growing for some time and among other causes was occasioned by the introduction and increase of the tales of chivalry  The ideas of chivalry in an imperfect degree had been of old established among the Gothic tribes The fashion of challenging to single combat the pride of se  king dangerous adventures and the spirit of avenging and protecting the fair sex seem to have been peculiar to the northern nations in the most uncultivated state of Europe All these customs were afterwards encouraged and confirmed by corresponding circumstances in the feudal constitution At length the crusades excited a new spirit of enterprise and introduced into the courts and ceremonies of European princes a higher degree of splendor and parade caught from the riches and magnificence of eastern cities  I cannot help transcribing here a curious passage from old Fauchett He is speaking of Louis the young king of France about the year  "Le quel fut le premier roy de sa maison qui monstra dehors ses richesses allant en Jerusalem Aussi la France commença de son temps a s'embellir de bastimens plus magni  iques prendre plaisir a pierrieres et autres delicatesses goustus en L  vant par luy ou les seigneurs qui avoient ja fait ce voyage De sorte qu'on peut dire qu'il a este le premier tenant Cour de grand Roy estant si magnifique que sa femme dedaignant la simplicité de ses predecesseurs luy fit elever une sepulture d'argent au lieu de pierre"  RECUEIL de la Lang et Poes Fr ch viii p edit  He adds that a great number of French romances were composed about this period  These oriental expeditions  established a taste for hyperbolical description and propagated an infinity of marvellous tales which men returning from distant countries easily imposed on credulous and ignorant minds The unparalleled emulation with which the nations of christendom universally embraced this holy cause the pride with which emperors kings barons earls bishops and knights strove to excel each other on this interesting occasion not only in prowess and heroism but in sumptuous equipages gorgeous banners armorial cognisances splendid pavilions and other expensive articles of a similar nature diffused a love of war and a fondness for military pomp Hence their very diversions became warlike and the martial enthusiasm of the times appeared in tilts and tournaments These practices and opinions cooperated with the kindred superstitions of dragons  See Kircher's Mund Subterran viii § He mentions a knight of Rhodes made grand master of the order for killing a dragon  dwarfs fairies giants and enchanters which the traditions of the Gothic scalders had already planted and produced that extraordinary species of composition which has been called ROMANCE  Before these expeditions into the east became fashionable the principal and leading subjects of the old fablers were the atchievements of king Arthur with his knights of the round table and of Charlemagne with his twelve peers But in the romances written after the holy war a new set of champions of conquests and of countries were introduced Trebizonde took place of Rouncevalles and Godfrey of Bulloigne Solyman Nouraddin the caliphs the souldans and the cities of Aegypt and Syria became the favourite topics The troubadours of Provence an idle and unsettled race of men took up arms and followed their barons  in prodigious multitudes to the conquest of Jerusalem They made a considerable part of the houshold of the nobility of France Louis the seventh king of France not only entertained them at his court very liberally but commanded a considerable company of them into his retinue when he took ship for Palestine that they might solace him with their songs during the dangers and inconveniencies of so long a voyage  Velley Hist Fr sub an  The antient chronicles of France mention  Legions de poetes  as embarking in this wonderful enterprise  Massieu Hist Poes Fr p Many of the troubadours whose works now exist and whose names are recorded accompanied their lords to the holy war Some of the French nobility of the first rank were troubadours about the eleventh century and the French critics with much triumph observe that it is the GLORY of the French poetry to number  counts  and  dukes  that is  sovereigns  among its professors from its commencement What a glory The worshipfull company of Merchanttaylors in London if I recollect right boast the names of many dukes earls and princes enrolled in their community This is indeed an honour to that otherwise respectable society But poets can derive no lustre from counts and dukes or even princes who have been enrolled in their lists only in proportion as they have adorned the art by the excellence of their compositions  Here a new and more copious source of fabling was opened in these expeditions they picked up numberless extravagant stories and at their return enriched romance with an infinite variety of oriental scenes and fictions Thus these later wonders in some measure supplanted the former they had the recommendation of novelty and gained still more attention as they came from a greater distance  The old French historian Mezeray goes so far as to derive the origin of the French poetry and romances from the crusades Hist p    In the mean time we should recollect that the Saracens or Arabians the same people which were the object of the crusades had acquired an establishm  nt in Spain about the ninth century and that by means of this earlier intercourse many of their fictions and fables together with their literature must have been known in Europe before the christian armies invaded Asia It is for this reason the elder Spanish romances have professedly more Arabian allusions than any other Cervantes makes the imagined writer of  Don Quixote's history an Arabian Yet exclusive of their domestic and more immediate connection with this eastern people the Spaniards from temper and constitution were extravagantly fond of chivalrous exercises Some critics have supposed that Spain having learned the art or fashion of romancewriting from their naturalised guests the Arabians communicated it at an early period to the rest of Europ  Hu  t in some measure adopts this opinion But that learned man was a very incompetent judge of these matters Under the common term  Romance  he confounds romanc  s of chivalry romances of gallantry and all the fables of the Provencial poets What can we think of a writer who having touched upon the gothic romances at whose  ictions and barbarisms he is much shocked talks of the  co  summate d  gr  of art and elegance to which the French are at present arrived in romances  He adds that the superior refinem  nt and politess  of the French gallantry has happily given them an advantage of shining in thi  species of composition Hist Rom p But the sophistry and ignorance of Huet's Treatise has been already detected and exposed by a critic of another cast in the SUPPLEMENT TO JARVIS'S PREFACE prefixed to the  Translation of Don Quixot      It has b  en imagined that the first romances were composed in metre and sung to the harp by the poets of Provence at f  stival solemnities but an ingenious Frenchman who has made deep researches into this sort of literature attempts to prove that this mode of reciting romantic adventures was in high reputation among the natives of Normandy above a century before the troubadours of Provence who are generally supposed to have led the way to the poets of Italy Spain and France commenced about the year  Mons L' Eveque de la Ravalerie in his  Revolutions de Langue Françoise à la suite des  POESIES DU ROI DE NAVARRE  If the critic means to insinuate that the French troubadours acquired their art of versifying from these Norman bards this reasoning will favour the system of those who contend that metrical romances lineally took their rise from the historical odes of the Scandinavian scalds for the Normans were a branch of the Scandinavian stock But Fauchett at the same time that he allows the Normans to have been fond of chanting the praises of their heroes in verse expressly  "Ce que les Normans avoyent pris des François"  Rec liv i p edit  pronounces that they borrowed this practice from the Franks or French  It is not my business nor is it of much consequence to discuss this obscure point which properly belongs to the French antiquaries I therefore proceed to observe that our Richard the first who began his reign in the year a distinguished hero of the crusades a most magnificent patron of chivalry and a Provencial poet  See Observations on Spenser i § i p And Mr Walpole's Royal and Noble authors i See also Rymer's  Short View of Tragedy  ch vii p edit Savarie de Mauleon an English gentleman who lived in the service of Saint Louis king of France and one of the Provencial poets said of Richard  Coblas a teira faire adroitement  Pou voz oillez enten dompna gentiltz  "He could make stanzas on the eyes of gentle ladies"  Rymer ibid p There is a curious story recorded by the French chroniclers concerning Richard's  kill in the minstrel art which I will here relateRichard in his return from the crusade was taken prisoner about the year A whole year elapsed before the English knew where their monarch was imprisoned Blondell de Nesle Richard's favourite  instrel resolved to find out his lord and after travelling many days without success at last came to a castle where Richard was detained in custody Here he found that the castle belonged to the duke of Austria and that a king was there imprisoned Suspecting that the prisoner was his master he found means to place himself directly before a window of the chamber where the king was kept and in this situation began to sing a French chanson which Richard and Blondell had formerly written together When the king heard the song he knew it was Blondell who sung it and when Blondell paused after the first half of the song the king began the other half and completed it On this Blondell returned home to England and acquainted Richard's baro  s with the place of his imprisonment from which he was soon afterwards released See also Fauchett Rec p Richard lived long in Provence where he acquired a taste for their poetry The only relic of his sonnets is a small fragment in old French accurately cited by Mr Walpole and written during his captivity in which he remonstrates to his men and barons of England Normandy Poictiers and Gascony that they suffered him to remain so long a prisoner Catal Roy and Nob Auth i Nostradamus's account of Richard is full of false facts and anachronisms Poet Provenc artic RICHARD  invited to his court many minstrels or troubadours from France whom he loaded with honours and rewards  "De regno Francorum cantores et joculatores muneribus allexerat"  Rog Hoved Ric i p These gratuities were chiefly arms cloaths horses and sometimes money  These poets imported into England a great multitude of their tales and songs which before or about the reign of Edward the second became familiar and popular among our ancestors who were sufficiently acquainted with the French language The  most early notice of a professed book of chivalry in England as it should seem appears under the reign of Henry the third and is a curious and evident proof of the reputation and esteem in which this sort of composition was held at that period In the revenueroll of the twentyfirst year of that king there is an entry of the expence of silver clasps and studs for the king's great book of romances This was in the year But I will give the article in its original dress  "Et in firmaculis hapsis et clavis argenteis ad magnum librum ROMANCIS regis  Rot Pip an Henr iii  "  That this superb volume was in French may be partly collected from the title which they gave it and it is highly probable that it contained the Romance of Richard the first on which I shall enlarge below At least the victorious atchievements of that monarch were so famous in the reign of Henry the second as to be made the subject of a picture in the royal palace of Clarendon near Salisbury A circumstance which likewise appears from the same antient record under the year  "Et in camera regis subtus capellam regis apud Clarendon lambruscanda et muro ex transverso illius camerae amovendo et hystoria Antiochiae in eadem depingenda cum DUELLO REGIS RICARDI  Rot Pip an Henr iii Richard the first performed great feats at the siege of Antioch in the crusade The  Duellum  was another of his exploits among the Saracens Compare Walpole's Anecd Paint i Who mentions a certain  great book  orrowed for the queen written in French containing GESTA ANTIOCHIAE  et reg  m aliorum  c This was in the year He adds that there was a chamber in the old palace of Westminster painted with this history  n the reign of Henry the third and therefore called the ANTIOCHCHAMBER and another in the Tower  "  To these anecdotes we may add that in the royal library at Paris there is  "Lancelot du Lac mis en Francois par Robert de Borron du commandement d' Henri roi de Angleterre avec figures  Cod fol max See Mont  auc Catal MSS p a  "  And the same manuscript occurs twice again in that library in three volumes and in four volumes of the largest folio  See Montf ibid  Which of our  Henrys it was who thus commanded the romance of LANCELOT DU LAC to be translated into French is indeed uncertain but most probably it was Henry the third just mentioned as the translator Robert Borron is placed soon after the year  Among the infinite number of old manuscript French romances on this subject in the same noble repository the learned Montfaucon recites  "Le Roman de Tristan et Iseult traduit de Latin en François par Lucas chevalier sieur du chastel du Gast pres de Salisberi Anglois avec figures"  Cod fol max And again  "Livres de Tristan mis en

of any castle or place of this name near Salisbury See also Cod    But not only the pieces of the French minstrels written in French were circulated in England about this time but translations of these pieces were made into English which containing much of the French idiom together with a sort of poetical phraseology before unknown produced various innovations in our style These translations it is probable were enlarged with additions or improved with alterations of the story Hence it was that Robert de Brunne as we have already seen complained of  strange  and  quaint  English of the changes made in the story of SIR TRISTRAM and of the liberties assumed by his cotemporary minstrels in altering facts and coining new phrases Yet these circumstances enriched our tongue and extended the circle of our poetry And for what reason these fables were so much admired and encouraged in preference to the languid poetical chronicles of Robert of Gloucester and Robert of Brunne it is obvious to conjecture The gallantries of chivalry were exhibited with new splendour and the times were growing more refined The Norman fashions were adopted even in Wales In the year a splendid carousal after the manner of the Normans was given by a Welsh prince This was Rhees ap Gryffyth king of South Wales who at Christmas made a great feast in the castle of Cardigan then  called Aberteivi which he ordered to be proclaimed throughout all Britain and to  "which came many strangers who were honourably received and worthily entertained so that no man departed discontented And among deeds of arms and other shewes Rhees caused all the poets of Wales  In illustration of the argument pursued in the text we may observe that about this time the English minstrels flourished with new honours and rewards At the magnificent marriage of the countess of Holland daughter of Edward the first every king minstrel received xl shillings See Anstis Ord Gart ii p And Dugd Mon i In the same reign a multitude of minstrels attended the ceremony of knighting prince Edward on the feast of Pentecost They entered the hall while the king was sitting at dinner surrounded with the new knights Nic Trivet Annal p edit Oxon The whole number knighted was two hundred and sixtyseven Dugd Bar i b Robert de Brunne says this was the greatest royal feast since king Arthur's at Carleon concerning which he adds  "therof yit men  rime"  p In the wardroberoll of the same prince under the year we have this  ntry  "Will Fox et Cradoco socio suo CANTATORIBUS cantantibus coram Principe et aliis magnatibus in

decorations which fancy could invent and recommended by the graces of romantic fiction They complimented the ruling passion of the times and cherished in a high degree the fashionable sentiments of ideal honour and fantastic fortitude  Among Richard's French minstrels the names only of three are recorded I have already m  ntioned Blondell de Nesle Fouqu  t of Marseilles and Ans  lme Fayditt many of whose compositions still remain were also among the poets patronised and entertained in England by Richard They are both celebrated and sometimes imitated by Dante and Petrarch Fayditt a native of Avignon united the professions of music and verse and the Provencials used to call his poetry  de bon mots e de bon son  Petrarch is supposed to have copied in his TRIUMFO DI AMORE many strokes of high imagination from a poem written by Fayditt on a similar subject particularly in his description of the Palace of Love But Petrarch has not left Fayditt without his due panegyric he says that Fayditt's tongue was shield helmet sword and spear  Triunf Am c iv  He is likewise in Dante's Paradise Fayditt was extremely profuse and voluptuous On the  death of king Richard he travelled on foot for near twenty years seeking his fortune and during this long pilgrimage he married a nun of Aix in Provence who was young and lively and could accompany her husband's tales and sonnets with her voice Fouquett de Marseilles had a beautiful person a ready wit and a talent for singing these popular accomplishments recommended him to the courts of king Richard Raymond count of Tholouse and Beral de Baulx where as the French would say  il fit les delices de cour  He fell in love with Adelasia the wife of Beral whom he celebrated in his songs One of his poems is entitled  Las complanchas de Beral  On the death of all his lords he received absolution for his sin of poetry turned monk and at length was made archbishop of Tholouse  See Beauchamps Recherch Theatr Fr Paris p It was Jeffrey Richard's brother who patronised Jeffrey Rudell a famous troubadour of Provence who is also celebrated by Petrarch This poet had heard from the adventurers in the crusades the beauty of a countess of

countess having received the news of the arrival of this gallant stranger hastened to the shore and took him by the hand He opened his eyes and at once overpowered by his disease and her kindness had just time to say inarticulately that  having seen her he died satisfied  The countess made him a most splendid funeral and erected to his memory a tomb of porphyry inscribed with an epitaph in Arabian

invited into England by Richard it is natural to suppose that some of them made their magnificent and heroic patron a principal subject of their compositions  Fayditt is said to have written a  Chant sunebre  on his death Beauchamps ib p  And this subject by means of the constant communication  between both nations probably became no less fashionable in France especially if we take into the account the general popularity of Richard's character his love of chivalry his gallantry in the crusades and the favours which he so liberally conferred on the minstrels of that country We have a romance now remaining in English rhyme which celebrates the atchievements of this illustrious monarch It is entitled RICHARD CUER DU LYON and was probably translated from the French about the period abovementioned That it was at least translated from the French appears from the Prologue  In Fraunce these rymes were wroht  Every Englyshe ne knew it not  From which also we may gather the popularity

 It is not improbable that both these rhyming chroniclers cite from the English translation if so we may fairly suppose that this romance was translated in the reign of Edward the first or his predecessor Henry the third Perhaps earlier This circumstance throws the French original to a still higher period  In the royal library at Paris there is  "Histoire de Richard Roi d'Angleterre et de Maquemore d'Irlande en rime  Num  "  Richard is the last of our monarchs whose atchievements were adorned with fiction and fable If not a superstitious belief of the times it was an hyperbolical invention started by the minstrels which soon grew into a tradition and is gravely recorded by the chroniclers that Richard carried with him to the crusades king Arthur's celebrated sword CALIBURN and that he presented it as a gift or relic of inestimable value to Tancred king of Sicily in the year  In return for several vessels of gold and silver horses bales of silk four great ships and fifteen gallies given by Tancred Benedict Abb p edit Hearne  Robert of Brunne calls this sword a  jewel  Jocale  In the general and true sense of the word Robert de Brunne in another place calls a rich

mentions some exploits of Richard almost incredible But as lord Lyttelton justly observes this historian is highly valuable on account of the knowledge he had of the facts which he relates It is from this writer we learn in the most authentic manner the actions and negotiations of Richard in the course of the enterprise for the recovery of the holy land and all the particulars of that memorable war  See Hist of Hen ii vol iv p App    But before I produce a specimen of Richard's English romance I stand still to give some more extracts from its Prologues which contain matter much to our present purpose as they have very fortunately preserved the subjects of many romances perhaps metrical then fashionable both in France and England And on these therefore and their origin I shall take

Here among others some of the most capital and favourite stories of romance are mentioned Arthur Charlemagne the Siege of Troy with its appendages and Alexander the Great and there are four authors of high esteem in the dark ages Geoffry of Monmouth Turpin Guido of Colonna and Callisthenes whose books were the grand repositories of these subjects and contained most of the traditionary fictions whether of Arabian or classical origin which constantly supplied materials to the writers of romance I shall speak of these authors with their subjects distinctly  But I do not mean to repeat here what has been already observed  See Diss i  concerning the writings of Geoffry of Monmouth and Turpin It will be sufficient to say at present that these two fabulous historians recorded the atchievements of Charlemagne and of Arthur and that Turpin's history was artfully forged under the name of that archbishop about the year with a design of giving countenance to the crusades from the example of so high an authority as Charlemagne whose pretended visit to the holy sepulchre is described in the twentieth chapter  As to the Siege of Troy it appears that both Homer's poems were unknown at least not understood in Europe from the abolition of literature by the Goths in the fourth century to the fourteenth Geoffry of Monmouth indeed who wrote about the year a man of learning for that age produces Homer in attestation of a fact asserted in his history but in such a manner as shews that he knew little more than Homer's name and was but imperfectly acquainted with Homer's subject Geoffry says that Brutus having ravaged the province of Acquitain with fire and sword came to a place where the city of Tours now stands  as Homer testifies  L i ch  But the Trojan story was still kept alive  in two Latin pieces which passed under the names of Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis Dares's history of the destruction of Troy as it was called pretended to have been translated from the Greek of Dares Phrygius into Latin prose by Cornelius Nepos is a wretched performance and forged under those specious names in the decline of Latin literature  In the Epistle prefixed the pretended translator Nepos says that he found this work at Athens in the handwriting of Dares He adds speaking of the controverted authenticity of Homer  De  a re At  enis  JUDICIUM  uit cum pro insano Homerus haberetur quod deos cum hominibus belligerasse descrip  it  In which words he does not refer to any public decree of the Athenian judges but to Plato's opinion in his REPUBLIC Dares with Dictys Cretensis next mentioned in the text was first printed at Milan in Mabillon says that a manuscript of the PseudoDares occurs in the Laurentian library at Florence upwards of eight hundred years old Mus Ital i p This work was abridged by Vincentius Bellovacensis a friar of Burgundy about the year See his Specul Histor lib iii  Dictys Cretensis is a prose Latin history of the Trojan war in six books paraphrased about the reign of Dioclesian or Constantine by one Septimius from some Grecian history on the same subject said to be discovered under a sepulchre by means of an earthquake in the city of Cnossus about the time of Nero and to have been composed by Dictys a Cretan and a soldier in the Trojan war The fraud of discovering copies of books in this extraordinary manner in order to infer from thence their high and indubitable antiquity so frequently practised betrays itself But that the present Latin Dictys had a Greek original now lost appears from the numerous grecisms with which it abounds and from the literal correspondence of many passages with the Greek fragments of one Dictys cited by antient authors The Greek original was very probably forged under the name of Dictys a traditionary writer on the subject in the reign of Nero who is said to have been fond of the Trojan story  See Perizon Dissertat de Dict Cretens sect xxix Constantinus Lascaris a learned monk of Constantinople one of the restorers of Grecian literature in Europe near four hundred years ago says that Dictys Cretensis in Greek was lost This writer is not once mentioned by Eustathius who lived about the year in his elaborate and extensive commentary on Homer  On the whole the work appears to  have been an arbitrary metaphrase of Homer with many fabulous interpolations At length Guido de Colonna a native of Messina in Sicily a learned civilian and no contemptible Italian poet about the year engrafting on Dares and Dictys many new romantic inventions which the taste of his age dictated and which the connection between Grecian and Gothic fiction easily admitted at the same time comprehending in his plan the Theban and Argonautic stories from Ovid Statius and Valerius Flaccus  The Argonautics of Valerius Flaccus are cited in Chaucer's  Hypsipile and Medea  "Let him reade the boke Argonauticon"  v But Guido is afterwards cited as a writer on that subject ibid Valerius Flaccus is a common manuscript See pag infr  compiled a grand prose romance in Latin containing fifteen books and entitled in most manuscripts  Historia de Bello Trojano  It was first

Porta archbishop of Salerno Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis seem to have been in some measure superseded by this improved and comprehensive history of the Grecian heroes and from this period Achilles Jason and Hercules were adopted into romance and celebrated in common with Lancelot Rowland Gawain Oliver and other christian champions whom they so nearly resembled in the extravagance of their adventures  Bale says that Edward the first having met with our author in Sicily in returning from Asia invited him into England xiii This prince was interested in the Trojan story as we shall see below Our historians relate that he wintered in Sicily in the year Chron Rob Brun p A writer quoted by Hearne supposed to be John Stowe the chronicler says that  "Guido de Columpna arriving in England  at the commaundement of king Edward the firste  made scholies and annotations upon Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrigius Besides these he writ at large the Battayle of Troye"  Heming Cartul ii Among his works is recited  Historia de Regibus Rebusque Angliae  It is quoted by many writers under the title of  Chronicum Britannorum  He is said also to have written  Chronicum Magnum libris  xxxvi See Mongitor Bibl Sic i  This work abounds with oriental imagery of which the subject was extremely susceptible It has also some traites of Arabian literature  The Trojan horse is a horse of brass and Hercules is taught astronomy and the seven liberal sciences But I forbear to enter at present into a more particular examination of this history as it must often occasionally be cited hereafter I shall here only further observe in general that this work is the chief source from which Chaucer derived his ideas about the Trojan story that it was professedly paraphrased by Lydgate in the year into a prolix English poem called the  Boke of Troye  Who mentions it in a French as well as Latin edit Signat B i pag  As in the latyn and the frenshe yt is It occurs in French MSS Bibl Reg Brit Mus F ix This manuscript was probably written not long after the year  at the command of king Henry the fifth that it became the groundwork of a new compilation in French on the same subject written by Raoul le Feure chaplain to the duke of Burgundy in the year and partly translated into English prose in the year by Caxton under the title of the  Recuyel of the histories of Troy  at the request of Margaret dutchess of Burgundy and that from Caxton's book afterwards modernised Shakespeare borrowed his drama of  Troilus and Cressida  The western nations in early times have been fond of deducing their origin from Troy This tradition seems to be couched under Odin's original emigration from that part of Asia which is connected with Phrygia Asgard or  Asia's  ortr  ss  was the city from which Odin led his colony and by some it is called Troy To this place also they supposed Odin to return after his death where he was to receive those who died in battle in a hall roofed with glittering shields See Bartholin L ii cap p seq This hall says the Edda is in the city of Asgard which is called the  Fi  ld of Ida  Bartholin ibid In the very sublime ode on the Dissolution of the World cited by Bartholine it is said that after the twilight of the gods should be ended and the new world appear  the Asae shall meet in the field of Ida and tell of the destroyed habitations  Barthol L ii cap p Compare Arngrim Jon Crymog l i c p See also Edda  ab In the proem to Resenius's Edda it is said  "Odin appointed twelve judges or princes at Sigtune in Scandinavia as at TROY and established there all the laws of TROY and the customs of the TROJANS"  See Hickes Thesaur i Dissertat Epist p See also Mallett's Hist Dannem ii p Bartholinus thinks that the compiler of the Eddic mythology who lived A D finding that the Britons and Francs drew their descent from Troy was ambitious of assigning the same boasted origin to Odin But this tradition appears to have been older than the Edda And it is more probable that the Britons and Francs borrowed it from the Scandinavian Goths and adapted it to themselves unless we suppose that these nations I mean the former were branches of the Gothic stem which gave them a sort of inherent right to the claim This reasoning may perhaps account for the early existence and extraordinary popularity of the Trojan story among nations ignorant and illiterate who could only have received it by tradition Geoffry of Monmouth took this descent of the Britons from Troy from the Welsh or Armoric bards and they perhaps had it in common with the Scandinavian scalders There is not a syllable of it in the authentic historians of England who wrote before him particularly those antient ones Bede Gildas and the uninterpolated Nennius Henry of Huntingdon began his history from  Caesar  and it w  s only on further information that he added  Brute  But this information was from a manuscript found by him in his way to Rome in the abbey of Bec in Normandy probably Geoffry's original  H Hunt Epistol ad Warin  MSS Cantabr Bibl publ cod I have mentioned in another place that Witlaf a king of the West Saxons grants in his charter dated A D among other things to Croylandabbey his robe of tissue on which was embroidered  The Destruction of Troy  Obs on Spenser's Fairy Queen i sect v p This proves the story to have been in high veneration even long before that period and it should at the same time be remembered that the Saxons came from Scandinavia  This fable of the descent of the Britons from the Trojans was solemnly alledged as an authentic and undeniable proof in a controversy of great national importance by Edward the first and his nobility without the least objection from the opposite party It was in the famous dispute concerning the subjection of the crown of England to that of Scotland about the year The allegations are in a letter to pope Bonifa  signed and sealed by the king and his lords Ypodigm Neustr apud Camd Angl Norman p Here is a curious instance of the implicit faith with which this tradition continued to be believed even in a more enlightened age  and an evidence that it was equally credited in Scotland    Proofs have been given in the two prologues just cited of the general popularity of Alexander's story another branch of Grecian history famous in the dark ages To these we may add the evidence of Chaucer  Alisaundres storie is so commune  That everie wight that hath discrecioune  Hath herde somewhat of or al of his fortune  V p Urr ed    And in the  House of Fame  Alexander

represented as soaring in the air by the help of gryphons At the end the opinions of di  ferent philosophers are recited concerning the sepulchre of Alexander Nectabanos a magician and astrologer king

is an account of Alexander's visit to the trees of the sun and moon but I do not recollect this in the printed copies Undoubtedly the original has had both interpolations and omissions PseudoGorionides abovementioned seems to hint at the groundwork of this history of Alexander in the following passage  "Caeteras autem res ab Alexandro gestas et egregia ejus facinora ac quaecunque demum perpetravit ea in libris Medorum et Persarum atque apud Nicolaum Titum et Strabonem et in libris nativitatis Alexandri rerumque ab ipso gestarum quos Magi ac Aegyptii eo anno quo Alexander decessit composuerunt scripta reperies"  Lib ii c Lat Vers p edit Jo Frid Briethaupt  But we should remember its origin The Arabian books abound with the most incredible fictions and traditions concerning Alexander the Great which they probably borrowed and improved from the Persians They call him Escander If I recollect right one of the miracles of this romance is our hero's horn It is said that Alexander gave the signal to his whole army by a wonderful horn of immense magnitude which might be heard at the distance of sixty miles and that it was blown or sounded by sixty men at once  It is also in a manuscript entitled  Secretum Secretorum Aristotelis  Lib MSS Bodl D This treatise ascribed to Aristotle was antiently in high repute It is pretended to have been translated out of Greek into Arabic or Chaldee by one John a Spaniard from thence into Latin by Philip a Frenchman at length into English verse by Lidgate under whom more will be said of it I think the Latin is dedicated to Theophina a queen of Spain  This is the horn which Orlando won from the giant Jatmund and which as Turpin and the Islandic bards report was endued with magical power and might be heard at the distance of twenty miles Cervantes says that it was bigger than a massy beam  See Observat Fair Qu i § v p  Boyardo  Berni and Ariosto have all such a horn and the fiction is here traced to its original source But in speaking of the books which furnished the story of Alexander I must not forget that Quintus Curtius was an admired historian of the romantic ages He is quoted in the POLICRATICON of John of Salisbury who died in the year  viii  Eneas Sylvius relates that Alphonsus the ninth king of Spain in the thirteenth century a great astronomer endeavoured to relieve himself from a tedious malady by reading the bible over fourteen times with all the glosses but not meeting with the expected success he was cured by the consolation he received from once reading Quintus Curtius  Op p  Peter Blesensis archdeacon of London a student at Paris about the year mentioning the books most common in the schools declares that he  profited much by frequently looking into this author  Epist  Frequenter inspicere historias Q Curtii c  Vincentius Bellovacensis cited above a writer of the thirteenth century often quotes Curtius in his  Speculum Historiale  iv c Montfaucon I think mentions a manuscript of Q Curtius in the Colbertine library at Paris eight hundred years old See Barth ad Claudian p Alexander Bened  ctus in his history of Venice transcribes whole pages from this historian I could give other proofs  He was also early translated into French Among the royal manuscripts in the British Museum there is a fine copy of a French translation of this classic adorned with elegant old paintings and illuminations entitled  Quinte Curse Ruf des faiz d' Alexandre  ix  liv translate par Vasque de Lucene Portugalois Escript par la main de Jehan du Chesne a Lille  F i Brit Mus And again C iii And D iv  It was made in But I believe the Latin translations of Simeon Seth's romance on this subject were best known and most esteemed for some centuries  The French to resume the main tenour of our argument had written metrical romances on most of these subjects before or about the year Some of these seem to have  been formed from prose histories enlarged and improved with new adventures and embellishments from earlier and more simple tales in verse on the same subject Chrestien of Troys wrote  Le Romans du Graal  or the adventures of the Sangrale which included the deeds of king Arthur Sir Tristram Lancelot du Lake and the rest of the knights of the round table before There is a passage in a coeval romance relating to Chrestien which proves what I have just advanced that some of these histories previously existed in prose  Christians qui entent et paine  A rimoyer le meillor conte  Par le commandement le Conte  Qu'il soit contez in cort royal  Ce est li contes

vielles proses et rymes et puis refraichis de language"  Rec liv ii x  The oldest manuscripts of romances on these subjects which I have seen are the following They are in the royal manuscripts of the British Museum  Le Romanz de Tristran  D ii This was probably transcribed not long after the year  Hist  ire du Lancelot ou S Graal  ibid iii Perhaps older than the year Again  Hist  ire du S Graal ou Lancelot  C vi Transcribed soon after This is imperfect at the beginning The subject of Joseph of Arimathea bringing a vessel of the Sanguis realis or Sangral that is our Saviour's blood into England is of high antiquity It is thus mentioned in  Morte Arthur  "And then the old man had an harpe and he sung  an olde songe  how Joseph of Arimathy came into this lande"  B iii c    Chrestien also wrote the romance of  Sir Percival  which belongs to the same history  Fauchett p This story was also written in very old rhyme by one Menessier not mentioned in Fauchett from whence it was reduced into

Rauol de Biavais mentioned by Fauchet p Compare Lenglet Bibl Rom p The author of this lastmentioned Percevall in the exordium says that he wrote among others the romances of Eneas Roy Marc and Uselt le Blonde and that he translated into French Ovid's Art of Love  Godfrey de Leigni a cotemporary  finished a romance begun by Chrestien entitled  La Charette  containing the adventures of Launcelot Fauchett affirms that Chrestien abounds with beautiful inventions  P ibid  But no story is so common among the earliest French poets as Charlemagne and his Twelve peers In the British Museum we have an old French manuscript containing the history of Charlemagne translated into prose from Turpin's Latin The writer declares that he preferred a sober prose translation of this authentic historian as histories in rhyme undoubtedly very numerous on this subject looked so much like lies  There is a curious passage to this purpose in an old French prose romance of Charlemagne written before the year  "Baudouin Comte de Hainau trouva a sens en Bourgongne le VIE de Charlemagne et mourant la donna a sa sour Yolond Comtesse de S Paul qui m'a prie que je la mette en  Roman sans ryme  Parce que tel se

Cod membr f There is a very old metrical romance on this subject ibid MSS Harl f Cod membr to  "  Oddegir the Dane makes a part of Charlemagne's history and I believe is mentioned by archbishop Turpin But his exploits have been recorded in verse by Adenez an old French poet not mentioned by Fauchett author of the two metrical romances of  Berlin  and  Cleomades  under the name of  Ogier le Danois  in the year This author was master of the musicians or as others say herald at arms to the duke of Brabant Among the royal manuscripts in the Museum we have a poem  Le Livre de Ogeir de Dannemarche  E

antient poem at least not posterior to the thirteenth century entitled  Roman de Troye  written by Benoit de Sainct More As this author appears not to have been known to the accurate Fauchett nor la Croix du Maine I will cite the exordium especially as it records his name and implies that the piece translated from the Latin and that the subject was not then common in French  Cette estoire n'est pas usée  N'en gaires livres n'est trouvée  La retraite ne fut encore  Mais Beneoit de sainte More  L' a translatè et fait et dit  Et a sa main les mots ecrit  He mentions his own name again in the

the twelfth century  Monum Fr i  We find also among the royal manuscripts at Paris Dictys Cretensis  t  anslated into French verse  See Mont  Catal MSS ii p  To this subject although almost equally belonging to that of Charlemagne we may also refer a French romance in verse written by Philipes Mousques canon and chancellor of the church of Tournay It is in fact a chronicle of France but the author who does not chuse to begin quite so high as Adam and Eve nor yet later than the Trojan war opens his history with the rape of Helen passes on to an ample description of the siege of Troy and through an exact detail of all the great events which succeeded conducts his reader to the year This work comprehends all the fictions of Turpin's Charlemagne with a variety of other extravagant stories dispersed in many professed romances But it preserves numberless curious particulars which throw considerable light on historical facts Du Cange has collected from it all that concerns the French emperors of Constantinople which he has printed at the end of his entertaining history of that city  It was indeed the fashion for the historians of these times to form such a general plan as would admit all the absurdities of popular tradition Connection of parts and uniformity of subject were as little studied as truth Ages of ignorance and superstition are more affected by the marvellous than by plain facts and believe what they find written without discernment or examination No man before the sixteenth century presumed to doubt that the Francs derived their o  igin from Francus a son of Hector that the Spaniards were descended from Japhet the Britons from Brutus and the Scotch from Fergus Vincent de Beauvais who lived under Louis the ninth of France and who on account of his extraordinary erudition was appointed preceptor to that king's sons very gravely classes archbishop Turpin's Charlemagne among the real histories and places it on a level with Suetonius and Cesar He was himself an historian  and has left a large history of the world fraught with a variety of reading and of high repute in the middle ages but edifying and entertaining as this work might have been to his cotemporaries at present it serves only to record their prejudices and to characterise their credulity  He flourished about    Hercules and Jason as I have before hinted were involved in the Trojan story by Guido de Colonna and hence became familiar to the romance writers  The TROJOMANNA SAGA a Scandic manuscript at Stockholm seems to be posteriour to Guido's publication It begins with Jason and Hercules and their  oyage to Colchos proceeds to the rape of Helen and ends with the siege and destruction of Troy It celebrates all the Grecian and Asiatic heroes concerned in that war Wanl Antiquit Septentr p col  The Hercules the Theseus and the Amazons of Boccacio hereafter more particularly mentioned came from this source I do not at present recollect any old French metrical romances on these subjects but presume that there are many Jason seems to have vied with Arthur and Charlemagne and so popular was his expedition to Colchos or rather so firmly believed that in honour of so respectable an adventure a duke of Burgundy instituted the order of the  Golden Fleece  in the year At the same time his chaplain Raoul le Feure illustrated the story which gave rise to this magnificent institution in a prolix and elaborate history afterwards translated by Caxton  See Observat on Spenser's Fairy Queen i § v P seq Montfaucon mentions  M  d  ae et Ja  onis Hi  loria

of the old French poetry is on the subject of this victorious monarch entitled  Roman d' Alexandre  It has been called the second poem now remaining in the French language and was written about the year It was confessedly translated from the Latin but it bears a nearer resemblance to Simeon Seth's romance than to Quintus Curtius It was the confederated performance of four writers who as Fauchett

See Fabric Bibl Gr c iii l viii p  I know not whether this work was ever printed It is voluminous and in the Bodleian library at Oxford is a vast folio manuscript of it on vellum which is of great antiquity richly decorated and in high preservation  MSS Bodl B fol  The margins and initials exhibit not only fantastic ornaments and illuminations exquisitely finished but also pictures executed with singular elegance expressing the incidents of the story and displaying the fashion of buildings armour dress musical instruments  The most frequent of these are organs h  gpipes lutes and trumpets  and other particulars appropriated to the times At the end we read this hexameter which points out the name of the scribe  Nomen scriptoris est THOMAS PLENUS AMORIS  Then follows the date of the year in which the transcript was completed viz Afterwards there is the name and date of the illuminator in the following colophon written in golden letters  "Che livre fu perfais de la enluminiere an xviii  o  jour davryl par Jehan de grise l' an de grace m ccc xliii  The bishop of Gloucester has a most beautiful French manuscript on vellum of  Mort d'Arthur  ornamented in the same manner It was a present from Vertue the engraver  "  Hence it may be concluded that the illuminations and paintings of this superb manuscript which were most probably begun as soon as the scribe had finished his part took up six years no long time if we consider the attention of an artist to ornaments so numerous so various so minute and so laboriously touched It has been supposed that before the appearance of this poem the  Romans  or those pieces which celebrated GESTS were constantly composed in short verses of six or eight syllables and that in this  Roman d' Alexandre  verses of twelve syllables were first used It has therefore been imagined that the verses called ALEXANDRINES the present French heroic measure took  their rise from this poem Alexander being the hero and Alexander the chief of the four poets concerned in the work That the name some centuries afterwards might take place in honour of this celebrated and early effort of French poetry I think is very probable but that verses of twelve syllables made their first appearance in this poem is a doctrine which to say no more from examples already produced and examined is at least ambiguous  See Pref  Le Roman de la

one of the chapters is  "Comment Alexander fuit mys en un vesal de vooire pour veoir le merveiles c"  This is a passage already quoted from Simeon Seth's romance relating Alexander's expedition to the bottom of the ocean in a vessel of glass for the purpose of inspecting fishes and sea monsters In another place from the same romance he turns astronomer and soars to the moon by the help of four gryphons The caliph is frequently mentioned in this piece and Alexander like Charlemagne has his twelve peers  These were the four reigning stories of romance On which perhaps English pieces translated from the French existed before or about the year But there are some other English romances mentioned in the prologue of RICHARD CUEUR DE LYON which we likewise probably received from the French in that period and on which I shall here also enlarge  BEUVES  de Hanton  or  Sir Beavis of Southampton  is a French romance of considerable antiquity although the hero is not older than the Norman conquest It is alluded to in  our English romance on this story which will again be cited and at large  Forth thei yode  so saith the boke  Sign P ii    And again more expresly  Under the

old French romances Bevis was a Saxon chieftain who seems to have extended his dominion along the southern coasts of England which he is said to have defended against the Norman invaders He lived at Downton in Wiltshire Near Southampton is an artificial hill called  Bevis Mount  on which was probably a fortress  It is now inclosed in the beautiful gardens of General Sir John Mordaunt and gives name to his seat  It is pretended that he was earl of Southampton His sword is shewn in Arundel castle This piece was evidently written after the crusades as Bevis is knighted by the king of Armenia and is one of the generals at the siege of Damascus  GUY EARL OF WARWICK is recited as a French romance by Labbe  Ubi supr  In the British Museum a metrical history in very old French appears in which Felicia or Felice is called the  daughter of an earl of Warwick and Guido or Guy of Warwick is the son of Seguart the earl's steward The manuscript is at present imperfect  MSS Harl  Montfaucon mentions among the royal manuscripts at Paris  Roman de Guy et Beuves de Hanton  The latter is the romance last mentioned Again  Le Livre de Guy de Warwick et de Harold d' Ardenne  Catal MSS p  This Harold d'Arden is a distinguished warriour of Guy's history and therefore his atchievements sometimes form a separate romance as in the royal manuscripts of the British Museum where we find  Le Romant de Herolt Dardenne  E vi fol  In the English romance of Guy mentioned at large in its proper place this champion is called  Syr Heraude of Arderne  Sign L ii vers  At length this favourite subject formed a large prose romance entitled  Guy de Warwick Chevalier d'Angleterre et de la belle fille Felix samie  and printed at Paris in  Fol And again ib to  Chaucer mentions Guy's story among the  Romaunces of Pris  Rim Thop  and it is alluded to in the Spanish romance of  Tirante il Blanco  or  Tirante the White  supposed to have been written not long after the year  Percy's Ball iii  This romance was composed or perhaps enlarged after the crusades as we find that Guy's redoubted encounters with Colbrond the Danish giant with the monster of Dunsmore heath and the dragon of Northumberland are by no means equal to some of his atchievements in the holy land and the trophies which he won from the soldan under the command of the emperor Frederick  The romance of SIDRAC often entitled  Le Livere Sydrac le philosophe le quel hom appele le livere de le funtane de totes Sciences  appears to have been very popular from the present frequency of its manuscripts But it is rather a romance of Arabian philosophy than of chivalry It is a system of natural knowledge and particularly treats of the virtues of  plants Sidrac the philosopher of this system was astronomer to an eastern king He lived eight hundred and fortyseven years after Noah of whose book of astronomy he was possessed He converts Bocchus an idolatrous king of India to the christian faith by whom he is invited to build a mighty tower against the invasions of a rival king of India But the history no less than the subject of this piece displays the state nature and migrations of literature in the dark ages After the death of Bocchus Sidrac's book fell into the hands of a Chaldean renowned for piety It then successively becomes the property of king Madian Namaan the Assyrian and Grypho archbishop of Samaria The latter had a priest named Demetrius who brought it into Spain and here it was translated from the Greek into Latin This translation is said to be made at Toledo by Roger de Palermo a minorite friar in the thirteenth century A king of Spain then commanded it to be translated from Latin into Arabic and sent it as a most valuable present to Emir Elmomenim lord of Tunis It was next given to Frederick the Second emperor of Germany famous in the crusades This work which is of considerable length was translated into English verse and will be mentioned on that account again Sidrac is recited as an eminent philosopher with Seneca and king Solomon in the  Marchaunt's Second tale  ascribed to Chaucer  Urr p v There is an old translation of SIDRAC into Dutch MSS Marshall Bibl Bodl fol    It is natural to conclude that most of these French romances were current in England either in the French originals which were well understood at least by the more polite readers or else by translation or imitation as I have before hinted when the romance of  Richard Cuer de Lyon  in whose prologue they are recited was translated into English That the latter was the case as to some of them  at least we shall soon produce actual proofs A writer who has considered these matters with much penetration and judgment observes that probably from the reign of our Richard the first we are to date that remarkable intercommunication and mutual exchange of compositions which we discover to have taken place at some early period between the French and English minstrels The same set of phrases the same species of characters incidents and adventures and often the identical stories being found in the metrical romances of both nations  Percy's Ess on Anc Engl Minstr p  From close connection and constant intercourse the traditions and the champions of one kingdom were equally known in the other and although Bevis and Guy were English heroes yet on these principles this circumstance by no means destroys the supposition that their atchievements although perhaps already celebrated in rude English songs might be first wrought into romance by the French  Dugdale relates that in the reign of Henry the fourth about the year a lord Beauchamp travelling into the east was hospitably received at Jerusalem by the Soldan's lieutenant  "Who hearing that he was descended from the famous Guy of Warwick  whose story they had in books of their own language  invited him to his palace and royally feasting him presented him with three precious stones of great value besides divers cloaths of silk and gold given to his servants"  Baron i p col  This story is delivered on the credit of John Rouse the traveller's cotemporary Yet it is not so very improbable that Guy's history should be a book among the Saracens if we consider that Constantinople was not only a central and connecting point between the eastern and western world but that the French in the thirteenth century had acquired an establishment there under Baldwin earl of Flanders that the French language must have been known in Sicily Jerusalem Cyprus and Antioch in consequence of the conquests of Robert Guiscard Hugo le Grand and Godfrey of  ulloigne and that pilgrimages into the holy land were excessively frequent It is hence easy to suppose that the French imported many of their stories or books of this sort into the east which being thus understood there and suiting the genius of the orientals were at length translated into their language It is remarkable that the Greeks at Constantinople in the twelfth century and since called all the Europeans by the name of Franks as the Turks do to this day See Seld Polyolb § viii p  And it seems probable that we continued for some time this practice of borrowing from our neighbours Even the titles of our oldest romances such as  Sir Blandamoure  Sir Triamoure Sir Eglamoure of Artoys  In our English SYR EGLAMOUR OF ARTOYS there is this reference to the French from which it was translated Sign E i  His own mother there he wedde  In ROMAUNCE as we rede  Again fol ult  In ROMAUNCE this cronycle ys  The authors of these pieces often refer to their original Just as

romances in our language before Caxton translated from the French the History of Troy the Life of Charlemagne the Histories of Jason Paris and Vyenne  But I must not omit here that Du Cange recites a metrical French romance in manuscript  Le Roman de Girard de Vienne  written by Bertrand le Clerc Gloss Lat i IND AUCT p  xciii Madox has printed the names of several French romances found in the reign of Edward the third among which one on this subject occurs Formul Anglic p Compare  Observations on Sp  nser's Fairy Qu  n  vol ii § viii p Among the royal manuscripts in the British Museum ther  is in verse  Histoir  de G  ra  t  e Vianne et de ses freres  D xi This manuscript was perhaps written before the year  the Death of King Arthur and other prose pieces of chivalry by which as the profession of minstrelsy decayed and gradually gave way to a change of manners and customs romances in metre were at length imperceptibly superseded or at least grew less in use as a mode of entertainment at public festivities  Various causes concurred in the mean time to multiply books of chivalry among the French and to give them a superiority over the English not only in the number but in the excellence of those compositions Their barons lived in greater magnificence Their feudal system flourished on a more sumptuous extensive and lasting establishment Schools were instituted in their castles for initiating the young nobility in the rules and practice of chivalry Their tilts and tournaments were celebrated with a higher degree of pomp and their ideas of honour and gallantry were more exaggerated and refined  We may add what indeed has been before incidentally remarked that their troubadours were the first writers of metrical romances But by what has been here advanced I do not mean to insinuate without any restrictions that the French entirely led the way in these compositions Undoubtedly the Provencial bards contributed much to the progress of Italian literature Raimond the fourth of Arragon count of Provence about the year a lover and a judge of letters invited to his court the most celebrated of the songsters who professed to polish and adorn the Provencial language by various sorts of poetry  Giovan Villani Istor  vi c  Charles the first his soninlaw and the inheritor of his virtues and dignities conquered Naples and carried into Italy a taste for the Provencial literature At Florence especially this taste prevailed where he reigned many years with great splendour and where his successors resided Soon afterwards the Roman court was removed to Provence  Villani acquaints us that Brunetto Latini Dante's master was the first who attempted to polish the Florentines by improving their taste and style which he did by writing his grand work the TESORO in Provencial He died in See Villan ibid  ix c  Hitherto the Latin language had only been in use The Provencial writers established a common dialect and their examples convinced other nations that the modern languages were no less adapted to composition than those of antiquity  Dante designed at first that his  Inferno  and Treatise on monarchy should appear in Latin But finding that he could not so effectually in that language impress his satirical strokes and political maxims on the laity or illiterate he altered his mind and published those pieces in  talian Had Petrarch written his  Africa  his Eclogues and his prose compositions in Italian the literature of his country would much sooner have arrived at perfection  They introduced a love of reading and diffused a general and popular taste for poetry by writing in a language intelligible to the ladies and the people Their verses being conveyed in a familiar tongue became the chief amusement of princes and feudal lords whose courts had now begun to assume an air of  greater brilliancy a circumstance which necessarily gave great encouragement to their profession and by rendering these arts of ingenious entertainment universally fashionable imperceptibly laid the foundation of polite literature From these beginnings it were easy to trace the progress of poetry to its perfection through John de Meun in France Dante in Italy and Chaucer in England  This praise must undoubtedly be granted to the Provencial poets But in the mean time to recur to our original argument we should be cautious of asserting in general and indiscriminating terms that the Provencial poets were the first writers of metrical romance at least we should ascertain with rather more precision than has been commonly used on this subject how far they may claim this merit I am of opinion that there were two sorts of French troubadours who have not hitherto been sufficiently distinguished If we diligently examine their history we shall find that the poetry of the first troubadours consisted in satires moral fables allegories and sentimental sonnets So early as the year a tribunal called the  Court of Love  was instituted both in Provence and Picardy at which questions in gallantry were decided This institution furnished eternal matter for the poets who threw the claims and arguments of the different parties into verse in a style that afterwards led the way to the spiritual conversations of Cyrus and Clelia  This part of their character will be insisted upon more at large when we come to speak of Chaucer  Fontenelle does not scruple to acknowledge that gallantry was the parent of French poetry  Theatr Fr p  But to sing romantic and chivalrous adventures was a very different task and required very different talents The troubadours therefore who composed metrical romances form a different species and ought always to be considered separately And  this latter class seems to have commenced at a later period not till after the crusades had effected a great change in the manners and ideas of the western world In the mean time I hazard a conjecture Cinthio Giraldi supposes that the art of the troubadours commonly called the  Gay Science  was first communicated from France to the Italians and afterwards to the Spaniards  Apud Huet Orig Rom p  This perhaps may be true but at the same time it is highly probable as the Spaniards had their JUGLARES or convivial bards very early as from long connection they were immediately and intimately acquainted with the fictions of the Ara  ians and as they were naturally fond of chivalry that the troubadours of Provence in great measure caught this turn of fabling from Spain The communication to mention no other obvious means of intercourse in an affair of this nature was easy through the ports of Toulon and Marseilles by which the two nations carried on from early times a constant commerce Even the French critics themselves universally allow that the Spaniards having learned rhyme from the Arabians through this very channel conveyed it to Provence Tasso preferred  Amadis de Gaul  a romance originally written in Spain by Vasco Lobeyra before the year  Nic Antonius Bibl Hispan Vet tom ii l viii c num  to the most celebrated pieces of the Provencial poets  Disc del Poem Eroic l ii p  But this is a subject which will perhaps receive illustration from a writer of great taste talents and industry Monsieur de la Curne de Sainte Palaye who will soon oblige the world with an ample history of Provencial poetry and whose researches into a kindred subject already published have opened a new and extensive field of information concerning the manners institutions and literature of the feudal ages  See  Memoires sur l'ancienne Chevalerie  c Paris ii tom  mo      SECT IV  VARIOUS matters suggested by the Prologue of RICHARD CUEUR DE LYON cited in the last section have betrayed us into a long digression and interrupted the regularity of our annals But I could not neglect so fair an opportunity of preparing the reader for those metrical tales which having acquired a new cast of fiction from the crusades and a magnificence of manners from the encrease of chivalry now began to be greatly multiplied and as it were professedly to form a separate species of poetry I now therefore resume the series and proceed to give some specimens of the English metrical romances which appeared before or about the reign of Edward the second and although most of these pieces continued to be sung by the minstrels in the halls of our magnificent ancestors for some centuries afterwards yet as their first appearance may most probably be dated at this period they properly coincide in this place with the tenour of our history In the mean time it is natural to suppose that by frequent repetition and successive changes of language during many generations their original simplicity must have been in some degree corrupted Yet some of the specimens are extracted from manuscripts written in the reign of Edward the third Others indeed from printed copies where the editors took great liberties in accommodating the language to the times However in such as may be supposed to have suffered most from depravations of this sort the substance of the ancient style still remains and at least the structure of the story On the whole we mean to give the reader an idea of those popular heroic tales in verse professedly written for the harp which began to be multiplied among us about the beginning of the fourteenth  century We will begin with the romance of RICHARD CUEUR DE LYON already mentioned  The poem opens with the marriage of Richard's father Henry the second with the daughter of Carbarryne a king of Antioch But this is only a lady of romance Henry married Eleanor the divorced queen of Louis of France The minstrels could not conceive any thing less than an eastern princess to be the mother of this magnanimous hero  His barons him redde  Advised

splendid tournament held at Salisbury Clarendon near Salisbury was one of the king's palaces  In the piperolls of this king's reign I find the following articles relating to this ancient palace which

fyre grekys  or Grecian fire seems to be a composition belonging to the Arabian chemistry It is frequently mentioned by the Byzantine historians and was very much used in the wars of the middle ages both by sea and land It was a sort of wildfire said to be inextinguishable by water and chiefly used for burning ships against which it was thrown in pots or phials by the hand In land engagements it seems to have been discharged by machines constructed on purpose The oriental Greeks pretended that this artificial fire was invented by Callinicus an architect of Heliopolis under Constantine and that Constantine prohibited them from communicating the manner of making it to any foreign people It was however in common use among the nations confederated with the Byzantines and Anna Commena has given an account of its ingredients  See Du Cange Not ad Joinvil p And Gl Lat V IGNIS GRAECUS  which were bitumen sulphur and naptha It is called  feu gregois  in the French chronicles and romances

on that occasion and many others by the Saracens against the Christians  See more particularly Chron Rob Brun p And Benedict Abb p And Joinv Hist L p  Procopius in his history of the Goths calls it

that Richard was killed by the French from the shot of an arcubalist a machine which he often worked skillfully with his own hands and Guillaume le Briton a Frenchman in his Latin  poem called Philippeis introduces Atropos making a decree that Richard should die by no other means than by a wound from this destructive instrument the use of which after it had been interdicted by the pope in

do not appear to have used in their wars so formidable and complicated an engine as this is described to have been in the writers of the dark ages It was the capital machine of the wars of those ages

Louis's army was encamped on the banks of the Thanis in Aegypt says the same curious historian about the year they erected two  chats chateil    or covered galleries to shelter their workmen and at the end of them two  b  frois  or vast moveable wooden towers full of crossbow men who kept a continual discharge on the opposite shore Besides eighteen other newinvented engines for throwing stones and bolts But in one night the deluge of Greek fire ejected from the Saracen camp utterly destroyed these enormous machines This was a common disaster but Joinville says that his pious monarch

christian army got possession of the city of Babylon is probably the DUEL OF KING RICHARD painted on the walls of a chamber in the royal palace of Clarendon  See supr p  The soldan is represented as meeting Richard with a hawk on his fist to shew indifference or a contempt of his adversary and that he came rather prepared for the chace than the combat Indeed in the feudal times and long afterwards no gentleman appeared on horseback unless going to battle without a hawk on his fist In the  Tapestry of the Norman conquest  Harold is exhibited on horseback with a hawk on his fist and his dogs running before him going on an embassy from king Edward the Confessor to William Duke of Normandy  The hawk on the fist was a mark of great nobility We frequently find it upon antique seals and miniatures attributed to persons of both sexes So sacred was this bird esteemed that it was forbidden in a code of Charlemagne's laws for any one to give his hawk or his sword as part of his

profession became a science and the audience grew more civilised refinements began to be  studied and the romantic poet sought to gain new attention and to recommend his story by giving it the advantage of a plan Most of the old metrical romances are from their nature supposed to be incoherent rhapsodies Yet many of them have a regular integrity in which every part contributes to produce an intended end Through various obstacles and difficulties one point is kept in view till the final and general catastrophe is brought about by a pleasing and unexpected surprise As a specimen of the rest and as it lies in a narrow compass I will develope the plan of the fable now before us which preserves at least a coincidence of events and an uniformity of design  A king's daughter of England extremely beautiful is sollicited in marriage by numerous potentates of various kingdoms The king her father vows that of all these suitors that champion alone shall win his daughter who can unhorse him at a tournament This they all attempt but in vain The king every year assisted at an anniversary mass for the soul of his deceased queen who was interred in an abbey at some distance from his castle In the journey thither the princess strays from her damsels in a solitary forest she is discovered by a knight in rich armour who by many sollicitations prevails over her chastity and at parting gives her a sword without a point which he charges her to keep safe together with a pair of gloves which will fit no hands but her own  Gloves were antiently a costly article of dress and richly decorated They were sometimes adorned with precious stones Rot Pip an Hen  iii A D  "Et de i pectine auri c  m lapidibus pretiosis ponderant xliii  s  et iii  d  ob Et de ii paribus chirothecarum cum LAPIDIBUS"  This golden comb set with jewels realises the wonders of romance  At length she finds the road to her father's castle where after some time to avoid discovery she is secretly delivered of a boy Soon after the delivery the princess having carefully placed the child in a cradle with twenty pounds in gold ten pounds in silver the gloves given her by the strange knight and a letter consigns him to one  of her maidens who carries him by night and leaves him in a wood near a hermitage which she discerned by the light of the moon The hermit in the morning discovers the child reads the letter by which it appears that the gloves will fit no lady but the boy's mother educates him till he is twenty years of age and at parting gives him the gloves found with him in the cradle telling him that they will fit no lady but his own mother The youth who is called Degore sets forward to seek adventures and saves an earl from a terrible dragon which he kills The earl invites him to his palace dubs him a knight gives him a horse and armour and offers him half his territory Sir Degore refuses to accept this offer unless the gloves which he had received from his fosterfather the hermit will fit any lady of his court All the ladies of the earl's court are called before him and among the rest the earl's daughter but upon trial the gloves will fit none of them He therefore takes leave of the earl proceeds on his adventures and meets with a large train of knights he is informed that they were going to tourney with the king of England who had promised his daughter to that knight who could conquer him in single combat They tell him of the many barons and earls whom the king had foiled in several trials Sir Degore however enters the lists overthrows the king and obtains the princess As the knight is a perfect stranger she submits to her father's commands with much reluctance He marries her but in the midst of the solemnities which preceded the consummation recollects the gloves which the hermit had given him and proposes to make an experiment with them on the hands of his bride The princess on seeing the gloves changed colour claimed them for her own and drew them on with the greatest ease She declares to Sir Degore that she was his mother and gives him an account of his birth she told him that the knight his father gave her a pointless sword which was to be delivered to no person but the son  that should be born of their stolen embraces Sir Degore draws the sword and contemplates its breadth and length with wonder is suddenly seized with a desire of finding out his father He sets forward on this search and on his way enters a castle where he is entertained at supper by fifteen beautiful damsels The lady of the castle invites him to her bed but in vain and he is lulled asleep by the sound of a harp Various artifices are used to divert him from his pursuit and the lady even engages him to encounter a giant in her cause  All the romances have such an obstacle as this They have all an enchantress who detains the knight from his quest by objects of pleasure and who is nothing more than the Calypso of Homer the Dido of Virgil and the Armida of Tasso  But Sir Degore rejects all her temptations and pursues his journey In a forest he meets a knight richly accoutred who demands the reason why Sir Degore presumed to enter his forest without permission A combat ensues In the midst of the contest the combatants being both unhorsed the strange knight observing the sword of his adversary not only to be remarkably long and broad but without a point begs a truce for a moment He fits the sword to a point which he had always kept and which had formerly broken off in an encounter with a giant and by this circumstance discovers Sir Degore to be his son They both return into England and Sir Degore's father is married to the princess his mother  The romance of KYNG ROBERT OF SICILY begins and proceeds

their possession of that island which continued through many monarchies  A passage in Fauchett speaking of rhyme may perhaps deserve attention here  "Pour le regard de  Sicili  ns  je me tiens presque

found its way into romance as did many others of the mediterranean islands and coasts for the same reason Another of them Cilicia has accordingly given title to an antient tale called the KING OF TARS

it Laud G fol membran  Chaucer mentions in  Sir Topaz  among others the romantic poems of  Sir Blandamoure Sir Libeaux  and  Sir Ippotis  Of the former I find nothing more than the name occurring in Sir  Libeaux  To avoid prolix repetitions from other works in the hands of all I refer the reader to Percy's  Essay on antient metrical Romances  who has analysed the plan of Sir  Libeaux  or Sir  Libius Disconius  at large p See also p ibid  As to Sir  Ippotis  an antient poem with that title occurs in manuscript MSS Cotton Calig A f and MS Vernon f But as Chaucer is speaking of romances of chivalry which he means to ridicule and this is a religious legend it may be doubted whether this is the piece alluded to by Chaucer However I will here exhibit a specimen of it from the exordium MS

occasion in the progress of our poetry to bring other specimens of these compositions See Obs on Spenser's Fairy Queen ii  I must not forget here that Sir Gawaine one of Arthur's champions is celebrated in a separate romance Among Tanner's manuscripts we have the  Weddynge of Sir Ga  vain  Numb Bibl Bodl It begins  "Be ye blythe and listeneth to the lyf of a lorde riche"  Dr Percy has printed the  Marriage of Sir Gawayne  which he believes to have furnished Chaucer with his  Wife of Bath  Ball i It begins  "King Arthur lives in merry Carlisle"  I think I have somewhere seen a romance in verse entitled  The Turke and Gawaine"  But it  is neither my inclination nor intention to write a catalogue or compile a miscellany It is not to be expected that this work should be a general repository of our antient poetry I cannot however help observing that English literature and  English poetry suffer while so many pieces of this kind still remain concealed and forgotten in our manuscript libraries They contain in common with the proseromances to most of which indeed they gave rise amusing images of antient customs and institutions not elsewhere to be found or at least not otherwise so strikingly delineated and they preserve pure and unmixed those fables of chivalry which formed the taste and awakened the imagination of our elder English classics The antiquaries of former times overlooked or rejected these valuable remains which they despised as false and frivolous and employed their industry in reviving obscure fragments of uninstructive morality or uninteresting history But in the present age we are beginning to make ample amends in which the curiosity of the antiquarian is connected with taste and genius and his researches tend to display the progress of human manners and to illustrate the history of society  As a further illustration of the general subject and many particulars of this section and the three last I will add a new proof of the reverence in which such stories were held and of the familiarity with which they must have been known by our ancestors These fables were not only perpetually repeated at their festivals but were the constant objects of their eyes The very walls of their apartments were clothed with romantic history Tapestry was antiently the fashionable furniture of our houses and it was chiefly filled with lively representations of this sort The stories of the tapestry in the royal palaces of Henry the eighth are still preserved  "The seconde part of the Inventorye of our late sovereigne lord kyng Henry

subject of this note that he gave his monastery among other costly presents a great clock processionibus et spectaculis insignitum an organ of prodigious size and eleven bells six for the tower of the

title See Carpent Suppl Du Cange Lat Gl ii p More will be said of it when we come to Lydgate  At Durhamplace we find the Citie of Ladies  A famous French allegorical romance  the tapestrie of Thebes

Northumberland is said to be represented in tapestry in Warwick castle  In Warwike the truth shall ye see  In arras wrought ful craftely  Signat Ca Some perhaps may think this circumstance an innovation or addition of later minstrells A practice not uncommon    This piece of tapestry appears to have been in Warwick castle before the year It was then so distinguished and valued a piece of furniture that a special grant was made of it by king Richard the second in that year conveying  "that suit of arras hangings in Warwick castle which contained the story of the famous Guy earl of Warwick"  together with the castle of Warwick and other possessions to Thomas Holland earl of Kent  Dugd Bar i p  And in the restoration of forfeited property to this lord after his imprisonment these hangings are particularly specified in the patent of king Henry the fourth dated When Margaret daughter of king Henry the seventh was married to James king of Scotland in the year Holyrood House at Edinburgh was  plendidly decorated on that occasion and we are told in an antient record that the  "hanginge of the queenes grett chammer represented the ystory of Troye t  une"  Again  "the king's

proper place the hero of the piece sees all his future adventures displayed at large in the sumptuous tapestry of the hall of a castle I have before mentioned the most valuable and perhaps most antient work of this sort now existing the entire series of duke William  descent on England preserved in the church of Bayeux in Normandy and intended as an ornament of the choir on high festivals

poetry began to be written about the reign of Edward the second yet I have found only one English poet of that reign whose name has descended to posterity  Robert de Brunne above mentioned lived and perhaps wrote some of his pieces in this reign but he more properly belongs to the last  This is Adam Davy or Davie He may be placed about the year I can collect no circumstances of his life but that he was marshall of Stratfordlebow near London  This will appear from citations which follow  He has left several poems never printed which are almost as forgotten as his name Only one manuscript of these pieces now remains which seems to be coeval with it's author  MSS Bibl Bodl Laud I fol membran It has been much damaged and on that account is often illegible  They are VISIONS THE BATTELL OF JERUSALEM THE LEGEND OF SAINT ALEXIUS SCRIPTURE HISTORIES OF FIFTEEN TOKNES BEFORE THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT LAMENTATIONS OF SOULS and THE LIFE OF ALEXANDER  In the manuscript there is also a piece in prose intitled  The Pylgrymages of the holi land  f It begins  "Qwerr soever a cros standyth ther is a forgivenes of payne"  I think it is a description of the holy places and it appears at least to be of the handwriting of the rest    In the VISIONS which are of the religious kind Adam Davie draws this picture of Edward the second standing before the shrine of Edward the Confessor in Westminster abbey at his coronation The lines have a stre  gth arising from simplicity  To our Lorde Jeshu Crist in heven  Iche to day shawe myne sweven  Dream    That iche motte  Thought dreamed In the first

very old prose romance both in French and Italian on the subject of the  Destruction of Jerusalem  In an antient inventory of books all French romances made in England in the reign of Edward the third I find the romance of TITUS and VESPASIAN Madox Formul Anglican p See also Scipio Maffei's Traduttori Italiani p Crescimbeni Volg Poes vol i l p does not seem to have known of this romance in Italian Du Cange mentions  Le Roman de 'a Prise de Jerusalem par Titus  in verse Gloss Lat i IND AUCT p cxciv A metrical romance on this subject is in the royal manuscripts E viii Brit Mus There is an old French play on this subject acted in It was printed in fol M Beauchamps Rech Fr Theat p  It is translated from a Latin work in five books very popular in the middle ages entitled HEGESIPPI  de Bello Judaico et Excidio Urbis Hierosolymitanae Libri quinque  This is a licentious paraphrase of a part of Josephus's Jewish history made about the fourth century and the name Hegesippus is most probably corrupted from Josephus perhaps also called Josippus The paraphrast is supposed to be Ambrose of Milan who flourished in the reign of Theodosius  He mentions Constantinople and New Rome an  the provinces of Scotia and Saxonia From this work the Maccabe  s seem to have got into romance It was first printed at Paris fol Among the Bodleian manuscripts there is a most beautiful copy of this book believed to be written in the Saxon times  On the subject of Vespasian's siege of Jerusalem as related in this book our poet Adam Davie has left a poem entitled the BATTELL OF JERUSALEM  The latter part of this poem appears detached in a former part of our manuscript with the title THE VENGEAUNCE OF GODDES DEATH viz f b Thi  latter part begins with these lines  And at the fourty dayes ende  Whider I wolde he bade me we  de  Upon the mount of olyvete c  It begin thus  Listeneth all that beth alyve  Both cristen men and wyve  I wol you telle of a wondur cas  How Jhesu Crist bihated was  Of

hymself ilome  MS ut supr f    My readers will be perhaps surprised to find our language improve so slowly and will probably think that Adam Davie writes in a less intelligible phrase than many more antient bards already cited His obscurity however arises in great  measure from obsolete spelling a mark of antiquity which I have here observed in exact conformity to a manuscript of the age of Edward the second and which in the poetry of his predecessors especially the minstrellpieces has been often effaced by multiplication of copies and other causes In the mean time it should be remarked that the capricious peculiarities and even ignorance of transcribers often occasion an obscurity which is not to be imputed either to the author or his age  Chaucer in TROILUS AND CRESSIDA mentions  "the grete diversite in English and  in writing of our tongue  "  He therefore prays God that no person would  miswrite  or  missemetre  his poem lib ult v seq    But Davie's capital poem is the LIFE OF ALEXANDER which deserves to be published entire on many accounts It seems to be founded chiefly on Simeon Seth's romance abovementioned but many passages are also copied from the French ROMAN D' ALEXANDRE a poem in our author's age perhaps equally popular both in England and France It is a work of considerable length  MS ut supr f  I will first give some extracts from the Prologue  Divers in

Stirling castle in Scotland a poet named Robert Baston He was a Carmelite friar of Scarborough and the king intended that Baston being an eyewitness of the expedition should celebrate his conquest of Scotland in verse Hollingshead an historian not often remarkable for penetration mentions this circumstance as a singular proof of Edward's presumption and confidence in his undertaking against Scotland but a poet seems to have been a stated officer in the royal retinue when the king went to war  Leland Script Brit p Hollingsh Hist ii p Tanner mentions as a poet of England one Gulielmus Peregrinus who accompanied Richard the first into the holy land and sung his atchievements there in a Latin poem entitled ODOEPORICON RICARDI REGIS lib i It is dedicated to Herbert archbishop of Canterbury and Stephen Turnham a captain in the expedition He flourished about A D Tann Bibl p See Voss Hist Lat p He is called  "poeta per eam aetatem excellens"  See Bal iii Pits  Baston however appears to have been chiefly a Latin poet and therefore does not properly fall into our series At least his poem on the siege of Striveling castle is written in monkish Latin hexameters  It is extant in Fordun's Scotichron c xxiii l  and our royal bard being taken prisoner in the expedition was compelled by the Scotch to write a panegyric for his ransom on Robert Brus which is composed in the same style and language  Leland ut supr And MSS Harl Brit Mus See also Wood Hist Ant Univ Oxon i p  Bale mentions his  Poemata et Rhythmi Tragaediae et Comoediae vulgares  Apud Tanner p  Some of these indeed appear to have been written in English but no English pieces of t  is author now remain In the mean time the bare existence of dramatic compositions in England at this period even if written in  the Latin tongue deserve notice in investigating the progress of our poetry For the same reason I must not pass over a Latin piece called a comedy written in this reign perhaps by Peter Babyon who by Bale is styled an admirable rhetorician and poet and flourished about the year This comedy is thus entitled in the Bodleian manuscript  De Babione et Croceo domino Babionis et Viola filias  ra Babionis quam Croceus duxit invito Babione et Pecula uxore Babionis et Fodio suo  c  Arch B  It is written in long and short Latin verses without any appearance of dialogue In what manner if ever this piece was represented theatrically cannot easily be discovered or ascertained Unless we suppose it to have been recited by one or more of the characters concerned at some public entertainment The story is in Gower's CONFESSIO AMANTIS Whether Gower had it from this performance I will not enquire It appears at least that he took it from some previous book  I find writte of Babio  Which had a love at his menage  Ther was no fairer of hir age  And hight Viola by name c  And had affaited to his hande  His servant the which Spodius  Was hote c  A fresh a free and friendly man c  Which Croceus by name hight c  Lib v f b Edit Berth    In the mean time it seems most probable that this piece has been attributed to Peter Babyon on account of the likeness of the name BABIO especially as he is a ridiculous character On the whole there is nothing dramatic in the structure of this nominal comedy and it has certainly no claim to that title only as it contains a familiar and comic story carried  on with much scurrilous satire intended to raise mirth But it was not uncommon to call any short poem not serious or tragic a comedy In the Bodleian manuscript which comprehends Babyon's poem just mentioned there follows COMEDIA DE GETA this is in Latin long and short verses  Carmina composuit voluitque placere poeta  and has no marks of dialogue  f  In the library of Corpus Christi college at Cambridge is a piece entitled COMEDIA  ad monasterium de Hulme ordinis S Benedicti Dioces Norwic directa ad Reformationem sequentem cujus data est primo die Septembris sub anno Christi    et a morte

antique ornaments are the arms of Sir John Falstaff their principal benefactor This magnificent knight was also a benefactor to Magdalene College in Oxford He bequeathed estates to that society part of which were appropriated to buy liveries for some of the senior scholars But this benefaction in time yielding no more than a penny a week to the scholars who received the liveries they were called

of Dante's COMEDIES as they are styled is well known The comedies ascribed to Chaucer are probably his Canterbury tales We learn from Chaucer's own words that tragic tales were called TRAGEDIES In the

Limosin who wrote  Cinque belles  TRAGEDIES  des gestes de Jeanne reine de Naples  about the year Here he thinks he has discovered so early as the fourteenth century  "une Poete tragique"  I have never seen these five Tragedies nor perhaps had Fontenelle But I will venture to pronounce that they are nothing more than five tragical narratives Queen Jane murthered her four husbands and was afterwards put herself to death See Fontenelle's Hist de Theatr Fr Oevr tom trois p edit Paris  mo  Nor can I believe that the  Tragedies  and  Comedi  s  as they are called of Anselm Fayditt and

France par M de Beauchamps Paris  to  p  Bale calls his play or MYSTERY of GOD'S PROMISES a TRAGEDY which appeared about the year  I must however observe here that dramatic entertainments representing the lives of saints and the most eminent scriptural stories were known in England for more than two centuries before the reign of Edward the second These spectacles they commonly styled MIRACLES I have  already mentioned the play of saint Catharine acted at Dunstable about the year  DISSERTATION ii  William FitzStephen a writer of the twelfth century in his DESCRIPTION of LONDON relates that  "London for its theatrical exhibitions has holy plays or the representation of miracles wrought by confessors and of the sufferings of martyrs  "Lundonia pro spectaculis theatralibus pro ludis

says that they were such as  "MIRACULA VULGARITER APPELLAMUS  Vit Abbat ad calc Hist p edit  "  And we learn from Chaucer that in his time PLAYS OF MIRACLES were the common resort of idle gossips in

the learned Lwhyd's Archaeol Brit p And Borlase's Cornwall Nat Hist p edit  Our drama seems hitherto to have been almost entirely confined to religious subjects and these plays were nothing more than an appendage to the specious and mechanical devotion of the times I do not find expressly that any play on a profane subject either tragic or comic had as yet been exhibited in England Our very early ancestors scarce knew any other history than that of their religion Even on such an occasion as the triumphant entry of a king or queen into the city of London or other places the pageants were almost entirely scriptural  When our Henry the sixth ent  red Paris in in the quality of king of France he was met at the gate of Saint Denis by a Dumb Shew representing the birth of the Virgin Mary and her marriage the adoration of the three kings and the parable of the sower This pageant indeed was given by the French but the readers of Hollingshead will recollect many instances immediately to our purpose See Monstrelet apud Fonten Hist Theatr ut supr p  Yet I must observe that an article in one of the piperolls perhaps of the reign of king John and consequently about the year seems to place the rudiments of histrionic exhibition I mean of general subjects at a much higher period among us than is commonly imagined It is in these words  "Nicola uxor Gerardi de Canvill reddit computum de centum marcis pro maritanda Matildi filia sua cuicunque voluerit exceptis MIMICIS regis  Rot incert ut videtur Reg Johann Apud MSS James Bibl Bodl vii p  " "Nicola wife of Gerard of Canville accounts to the king for one hundred marks for the privilege of marrying his  daughter Maud to whatever person she pleases the king's MIMICS excepted"  Whether or no MIMICI REGIS are here a sort of players kept in the king's houshold for diverting the court at stated seasons at least with performances of mimicry and masquerade or whether they may not strictly imply MINSTRELLS I cannot indeed determine Yet we may remark that MIMICUS is never used for MIMUS that certain theatrical entertainments called mascarades as we shall see below were very antient among the French and that these MIMICI appear by the context of this article to have been persons of no very respectable character  John of Salisbury who wrote about says  "Histriones et mimi non possunt recipere sacram communionem"  POLICRAT i  I likewise find in the wardroberolls of Edward the third in the year an account of the dresses  ad faciendum  LUDOS  domini regis ad ffestum Natalis domini celebratos apud Guldeford  for furnishing the plays or sports of the king held in the castle of Guildford at the feast of Christmas  Comp J Cooke Provisoris Magnae Garderob ab ann Edw i ad ann Membr ix  In these LUDI says my record were expended eighty tunics of buckram of various colours fortytwo visours of various similitudes that is fourteen of the faces of women fourteen of the faces of men with beards fourteen of heads of angels made with silver twentyeight crests  I do not perfectly understand the Latin original in the place viz  "xiiij  Crestes  cum tibiis reversatis et calceatis xiiij  Crestes  cum montibus et cuniculis"  Among the stuffs are  "viii pelles de Roan"  In the same wardrobe rolls a little above I find this entry which relates to the same festival  "Et ad faciendum vi pennecellos pro tubis et clarionibus contra ffestum natalis domini de syndone vapulatos de armis regis quartellatis"  Membr ix  fourteen mantles embroidered with heads of dragons fourteen white tunics wrought with heads and wings of peacocks fourteen heads of swans with wings fourteen tunics painted with eyes of peacocks fourteen tunics of English linen painted and as many tunics embroidered with stars of gold and silver  Some perhaps may think that these were dresses for a MASQUE at court If so Hollingshead is mistaken in saying that in the year  "on the daie of Epiphanie at night the king with eleven others were disguised after the manner of Italie called a ma  ke  a thing not seen before in England  They were apparelled in garments long and broad wrought all with gold with visors and caps of gold c"  Hist vol iii p    Besides these maskings most probably came to the English if from Italy through the medium of France Hollingshead also contradicts him  elf for in another place he seems to allow their existence under our Henry the fourth A D  "The conspi  ators ment upon the sudden to have to have set upon the king in the castell of Windsor under colour of a  maske  or  mummerie  c"  ibid p b  Strype says there were PAGEAUNTS exhibited in London when queen Eleanor rode through the city to her coronation in And for the victory over the Scots by Edward the first in Anecdot Brit Topograph p Lond edit  In the rolls of  the wardrobe of king Richard the second in the year there is also an entry which seems to point out a sport of much the same nature  "Pro xxi  coifs  de tela linea pro hominibus de lege contrafactis pro LUDO r  gis tempore natalis domini anno xii  Comp Magn Gard  rob an Ric ii f b  "  That is  "for twentyone linen coifs for counterfeiting men of the law in the king's play at Christmas"  It will be sufficient to add here on the last record that the serjeants at law at their creation antiently wore a cap of linen lawn or silk tied under the chin this was to distinguish them from the clergy who had the tonsure Whether in both these instances we are to understand a dumb shew or a dramatic interlude with speeches I leave to the examination of those who are professedly making enquiries into the  history of our stage from its rudest origin But that plays on general subjects were no uncommon mode of entertainment in the royal palaces of England at least at the commencement of the fifteenth century may be collected from an old memoir of shews and ceremonies exhibited at Christmas in the reign of Henry the seventh in the palace of Westminster It is in the year  "This cristmas I saw no disguysings and but  right few  PLAYS But ther was an abbot of Misrule that made much sport and did right well his office"  And again  "At nyght the kynge the qweene and

prologue The French stage will occur again below  Whether or no these were dramatic SPECTACLES I do not pretend to decide In several of our old scriptural plays we see some of the scenes directed to

acting plays in churches was at last grown to such an enormity and attended with such inconvenient consequences that in the reign of Henry the  ighth Bonner bishop of London issued a proclamation to

sundays so late as the reign of Elizabeth and even till that of Charles  the first by the choristers or singingboys of Saint Paul's cathedral in London and of the royal chapel  It is certain that these MIRACLEPLAYS were the first of our dramatic exhibitions But as these pieces frequently required the introduction of allegorical characters such as Charity Sin Death Hope Faith or the like and as the common poetry of the times especially among the French began to deal much in allegory at length plays were formed entirely consisting of such personifications These were called MORALITIES The miracleplays or MYSTERIES were totally destitute of invention or plan they tamely represented stories according to the letter of scripture or the respective legend But the MORALITIES indicate dawnings of the dramatic art they contain some rudiments of a plot and even attempt to delineate characters and to paint manners From hence the gradual transition to real historical personages was natural and obvious It may be also observed that many licentious pleasantries were sometimes introduced in these religious representations This might imperceptibly lead the way to subjects entirely profane and to comedy and perhaps earlier than is imagined In a  MSS Digb Bibl Bodl  Mystery of the MASSACRE OF THE HOLY INNOCENTS part of the subject of a sacred drama given by the English fathers at the famous council of Constance in the year  L'Ensant ii  a low buffoon of Herod's court is introduced desiring of his lord to be dubbed a knight that he might be properly qualified to  go on the adventure  of killing the mothers of the children of Bethlehem This tragical business is treated with the most ridiculous levity The good women of Bethlehem attack our  nighterrant with their spinningwheels break his head with their distaffs abuse him as a coward and a disgrace to chivalry and send him home to Herod as a recreant champion with much ignominy It is in an enlightened age only  that subjects of scripture history would be supported with proper dignity But then an enlightened age would not have chosen such subjects for theatrical exhibition It is certain that our ancestors intended no sort of impiety by these monstrous and unnatural mixtures Neither the writers nor the spectators saw the impropriety nor paid a separate attention to the comic and the srious part of these motley scenes at least they were persuaded that the solemnity of the subject covered or excused all incongruities They had no just idea of decorum consequently but little sense of the ridiculous what appears to us to be the highest burlesque on them would have made no sort of impression We must not wonder at this in an age when courage devotion and ignorance composed the character of European manners when the knight going to a tournament first invoked his God then his mistress and afterwards proceeded with a safe conscience and great resolution to engage his antagonist In these Mysteries I have sometimes

both exhibited on the stage naked and conversing about  their nakedness this very pertinently introduces the next scene in which they have coverings of figleaves This extraordinary spectacle was beheld by a numerous assembly of both sexes with great composure they had the authority of scripture for such a representation and they gave matters just as they found them in the third chapter of Genesis It would have been absolute heresy to have departed from the sacred text in personating the primitive appearance of our first parents whom the spectators so nearly resembled in simplicity and if this had not been the case the dramatists were ignorant what to reject and what to retain  In the mean time profane dramas seem to have been known in France at a much earlier period  John of Salisbury a writer of the eleventh century speaking of the common diversions of his time says  "Nostra aetas prolapsa ad fabulas et quaevis inania non modo aures et cor prostituit vanitati c"

being acted by the choirboys of St Paul's church and the chapel royal which continued as I before observed till Cromwell's usurpation The English and French stages mutually throw light on each other's history But perhaps it will be thought that in some of these instances I have exemplified in nothing more than farcical and gesticulatory representations Yet even these traces should be attended to In the mean time we may observe upon the whole that the modern drama had its foundation in our religion and that it was raised and supported by the clergy The truth is the members of the ecclesiastical societies were almost the only persons who could read and their numbers easily furnished performers they abounded in leisure and their very relaxations were religious  I did not mean to touch upon the Italian stage But as so able a judge as Riccoboni seems to allow that Italy derived her theatre from those of France and England by way of an additional illustration of the antiquity of the two last I will here produce one or two MIRACLEPLAYS acted much earlier in Italy than any piece mentioned by that ingenious writer or by Crescimbeni In the year on  "the feast of Pentecost and the two following holidays the representation of the PLAY OF CHRIST that is of his passion resurrection ascension judgment and the mission of the holy ghost was performed by the clergy of  Civita Vecchia  in  uria

churches should not cease in Italy till the year  "  In the mean time those critics who contend for the high antiquity of the Italian stage may adopt these instances as new proofs in defence of that hypothesis  In this transient view of the origin and progress of our drama which was incidentally suggested by the mention of Baston's supposed Comedies I have trespassed upon future periods But I have chiefly done this for the sake of connection and to prepare the mind of the reader for other anecdotes of the history of our stage which will occur in the course of our researches and are reserved for their respective places I could have enlarged what is here loosely thrown together with many other remarks and illustrations but I was unwilling to transcribe from the colle  ions of those who have already treated this subject with great comprehension and penetration and especially from the author of the Supplement to the Translator's Preface of Jarvis's Don Quixote  See also

I have examined the annual rolls of his wardrobe which record various articles of costly stuffs delivered occasionally for the celebration of his tournaments such as standards pennons tunics caparisons with other splendid furniture of the same sort and it appears that he commanded these solemnities to be kept with a magnificence superior to that of former ages at Litchfield Bury Guildford

D  At his triumphant return from Scotland he was met by two hundred and thirty knights at Dunstable who received their victorious monarch with a grand exhibition of these martial exercises He established in the castle of Windsor a fraternity of twentyfour knights for whom he erected a round table with a round chamber still remaining according to a similar institution  of king Arthur  Walsing p  Anstis treats the notion that Edward in this establishment had any retrospect to king Arthur as an idle and legendary tradition  Ord Gart ii  But the fame of Arthur was still kept alive and continued to be an object of veneration long afterwards and however idle and ridiculous the fables of the round table may appear at present they were then not only universally known but firmly believed Nothing could be more natural to such a romantic monarch in such an age than the renovation of this most antient and revered institution of chivalry It was a prelude to the renowned order of the garter which he soon afterwards founded at Windsor during the ceremonies of a magnificent feast which had been proclaimed by his heralds in Germany France Scotland Burgundy Heynault and Brabant and lasted fifteen days  Barnes i ch p Froissart c Anstis ut supr  We must not try the modes and notions of other ages even if they have arrived to some degree of refinement by those of our own Nothing is more probable than that this latter foundation of Edward the third took its rise from the exploded story of the garter of the countess of Salisbury  Ashmole proves that the orders of the  Annunciada and of the Toison d'Or  had the like origin Ord Gart p Even in the ensigns of the order of the Holy Ghost founded so late as some lovemysteri  s and emblems were concealed under  yphers introduced into the blasonrie See L  Labourer Contin des Mem de Castelnau p  "Il y eut plus de myssteres d'amourettes que de religion c"  But I cannot in this place help observing that the fantastic humour of unriddling emblematical mysteries supposed to be concealed under all ensigns and arms was at length carried to such an extravagance at least in England as to be checked by the legislature By a statute of queen Elisabeth a severe penalty is laid  "on all fond phantastical prophecies upon or by the occasion of any arms fields beastes badges or the like things accustomed in arms cognisaunces or signetts c"  Statut v Eliz ch A D  Such an origin is interwoven with the manners and ideas of the times Their attention to the fair sex entered into every thing It is by no means unreasonable to suppose that the fantastic collar of Esses worn by the knights of this Order was an allusion to her name Froissart an eyewitness and well acquainted  with the intrigues of the court relates at large the king's affection for the countess and particularly describes a grand carousal which he gave in consequence of that attachment  Ubi supr  The first festival of this order was not only adorned by the bravest champions of christendom but by the presence of queen Philippa Edward's consort accompanied with three hundred ladies of noble families  They soon afterwards regularly received robes with the knights companions for this ceremony powdered with garters Ashmol Ord Gart And Anstis ii  The tournaments of this stately reign were constantly crouded with ladies of the first distinction who sometimes attended them on horseback armed with daggers and dressed in a succinct soldierlike habit or uniform prepared for the purpose  Knyghton Dec Script p  In a tournament exhibited at London

round the ranks of the English army encouraging the soldiers and was with some difficulty persuaded or compelled to relinquish the field  Froissart i c  The countess of Montfort is another eminent instance of female heroism in this age When the strong town of Hennebond near Rennes was besieged by the French this redoubted  amazon rode in complete armour from street to street on a large courser animating the garison  Froissart says that when the English proved victorious the countess came out of the castle and in the street kissed Sir Walter Manny the English general and his captains one

embarrassing at least more consistent with our prescribed method if we previously display the merits of two or three poets who appeared in the former part of the reign of Edward the third with other incidental matters  The first of these is Richard Hampole an eremite of the order of saint Augustine He was a doctor of divi  ity and lived a solitary life near the nuns of Hampole four miles from

no tincture of sentiment imagination or elegance The following verses are extracted from the PRICKE OF CONSCIENCE one of the most common manuscripts in our libraries and I prophesy that I am its last

translation from the Latin appears from these verses  Therefore this boke is in Englis drawe  Of fele  Many  matters that bene unknawe  To lewed men that are unkonande  Ignorant  That con no latyn undirstonde  MSS Digb ut supr ad princip    The Latin original in prose entitled STIMULUS CONSCIENT  AE  In the Cambridge manuscript of Hampole's PARAPHRASE ON THE LORD'S PRAYER abovementioned containing a prolix description of human virtues and vices at the end this remark appears  "Explicit quidam tractatus super Pater noster  secundum  Ric Hampole qui obiit A D MCCCLXXXIV"  But the true date of his death is in another place viz MSS More Princ  "Almighty God in trinite  "In whom is only personnes thre"  The PARAPHRASE ON THE BOOK OF JOB mentioned also before seems to have existed first in Latin prose under the title of PARVUM JOB The English begins thus  "Lieff lord my soul thou spare"  In Bibl Bodl MSS Laud F c c  It is a paraphrase of some Excerpta from the book of Job THE SEVEN PENITENTIAL PSALMS begin thus  "To goddis worschippe that d  re us bougt"  MSS Bodl Digb  Hampole's EXPOSITIO IN PSALTERIUM is not uncommon in English It has a preface in English rhymes in some copies in praise of the author and his work Pr  "This blessyd boke that hire"  MSS Laud F c  Hampole was a very popular writ  r Most of his many theological pieces seem to have been translated into English soon after they appeared and those pieces abound among our manuscripts Two of his tracts were translated by Richard Misyn prior of the Carmelites at Lincoln about the year The INCENDIUM AMORIS at the request of Margaret Hellingdon a reclus  Princ  "To the askynge of thi desire"  And DE EMENDATIONE VITAE  "Tarry thou not to oure"  They are in the translator's own handwriting in the library of C C C Oxon MSS I find other antient translations of both these pieces Particularly  The  PRICKE OF LOVE  after Richard Hampol treting of the thre  d  grees of love  MSS Bodl Arch B f As a proof of the confusions and uncertainties attending the works of our author I must add that we have a translation of his tract DE EMENDATIONE under this title  The  orm of p  r  yt living which  oly Richard the hermit wrote  o a recluse named Margaret    MS Vernon But Margarete is evidently the recluse at whose request Richard Misyn many years after Ha  pole's death translated the INCENDIUM AMORIS These observations to which others might be added are suf  ici  nt to conf  rm the suspicions insinuated in the text Many of Hampole's Latin th  ologi  al trac  s were printed very early at Pa  is and Cologne  was most probably writtten by Hampole and it is not very likely that he should translate his own work The author and translator were easily confounded As to the copy of the English poem given to bishop Grosthead he could not be the translator to say nothing more if Hampole wrote the Latin original On the whole whoever was the author of the two translations at least we may pronounce with some certainty that they belong to the reign of Edward the third  SECT VIII  THE next poet in succession is one who deserves more attention on various accounts This is Robert Longlande author of the poem called the VISION OF PIERCE PLOWMAN a s  cular priest and a fellow of Oriel college in Oxford He flourished about the year  I have here followed a date commonly received But it may be observed that there is in this poem an allusion to the fall of Edward the second The si  ge of Calais is also mentioned as a recent fact and  Bribery  accuses  Conscience  of obstructing the conquest of France See more in Observations on the Fairy Queen ii § xi p  This poem contains a series of distinct visions which the author imagines himself to have seen while he was sleeping after a long ramble on Malvernehills in Worcestershire It is a satire on the vices of almost every profession but particularly on the corruptions of the clergy and the absurdities of superstition These are ridiculed with much humour and spirit couched under a strong vein of allegorical invention But instead of availing himself of the rising and rapid improvements of the English language Longland prefers and adopts the style of the AngloSaxon poets Nor did he make these writers the models of his language only he likewise imitates their alliterative versification which consisted in using an aggregate of words beginning with the same letter He has therefore rejected rhyme in the place of which he thinks it sufficient to substitute a perpetual alliteration But this imposed constraint of seeking identical initials and the affectation of obsolete English by demanding a constant and necessary departure from the natural and obvious forms of expression while it circumscribed the powers of our author's genius contributed also to render his  manner extremely perplexed and to disgust the reader with obscurities The satire is conducted by the agency of several allegorical personages such as Avarice Bribery Simony Theology Conscience c There is much imagination in the following picture which is intended to represent human life and its various occupations  Then gan I to meten a mervelouse sweven

Winchester  Antiently before many flourishing towns were established and the necessaries or ornaments of life from the convenience of communication and the encrease of provincial civility could be procured in various places goods and commodities of every kind were chiefly sold at fairs to which as to one universal mart the people resorted periodically and supplied most of their wants for the ensuing year The display of merchandise and the conflux of customers at these principal and almost only emporia of domestic commerce was prodigious and they were therefore often held on open and extensive plains One of the chief of them seems to have been that of St Giles's hill or down near Winchester to which our poet here refers It was instituted and given as a kind of revenue to the bishop of Winchester by William the conqueror who by his charter permitted it to continue for three days But in consequence of new royal grants Henry the third prolonged its continuance to sixteen days Its jurisdiction extended seven miles round and comprehended even Southampton then a capital trading town and all merchants who sold wares within that circuit forfeited them to the bishop Officers were placed at a considerable distance at bridges and other avenues of access to the fair to exact toll of all merchandise passing that way In the mean time all shops in the city of Winchester were shut In the fair was a court called the pavilion at which the bishop's justiciaries and other officers assisted with power to try causes of v  rious sorts for seven miles round nor among other singular claims could any lord of a manor hold a courtbaron within the said circuit without licence from the pavilion During this time the bishop was empowered to take toll of  very load or parcel of goods passing through the gates of the city On Saint Giles's eve the mayor bailiffs and citizens of the city of Winchester delivered the keys of the four city gates to the bishop's officers who during the said sixteen days appointed a mayor and bailiff of their own to govern the city and also a coroner to act within the said city Tenants of the bishop who held lands by doing service at the pavilion attended the same with horses and armour not only to do suit at the court there but to be ready to assist the bishop's officers in the execution of writs and other services But I cannot here enumerate the many extraordinary privileges granted to the bishop on this occasion all tending to obstruct trade and to oppress the people Numerous foreign merchants frequented this fair and it appears that the justiciaries of the pavilion and the treasurer of the bishop's palace of Wolvesey received annually for a fee according to antient custom four basons and ewers of those foreign merchants who sold brasen vessels in the fair and were called  mercat  res diaunteres  In the fair several streets were formed assigned to the sale of different commodities and called the  Drap  ry  the  Pottery  the  Spicery  c Many monasteries in and about Winchester had shops or houses in these streets used only at the fair which they held under the bishop and often lett by lease for a term of years One place in the fair was called  Speciarium San  i  wythini  or  the Spicery of Saint Swithin's monastery  In the revenuerolls of the antient bishops of Winchester this fair makes a grand and separate article of reception under this title FERIA  Computus  iae sancti Egidii  But in the revenueroll of bishop Will of Waynflet  an it appears to have greatly decayed in which among other proofs I find mention made of a district in the fair being unoccupied  "Ubi homines Cornubiae stare solebant"  From whence it likewise appears that different counties had their different stations The whole reception to the bishop this year from the fair amoun  ed only to  l    s    d  Yet this sum small as it may seem was worth upwards of  l  Edward the first sent a precept to the sheriff of Hampshire to restore to the bishop this fair which his escheator Malcolm de Harlegh had seized into the king's hands without command of the treasurer and barons of the exchequer in the year Registr Joh de Pontissara Episc Wint fol After the charter of Henry the third many kings by charter confirmed this fair with all its privileges to the bishops of Winchester The last charter was of Henry the eighth to bishop Richard Fox and his successors in the year But it was followed by the usual confirmationcharter of Charles the second In the year when Brian Fitzcount lord of Wallingford in Berkshire maintained Walling  ord castle one of the strongest garrisons belonging to Maud the empress and consequently sent out numerous parties for contributions and provisions Henry de Blois bishop of Winchester enjoined him not to molest any passengers that were coming to his fair at Winchester under pain of excommunication  Omnibus ad  FERIAM MEAM  ve  entibus  c MSS Dodsworth vol f Bibl Bodl This was in king Stephen's reign In that of Richard the first in the year the king grants to Portsmouth a fair lasting for  fteen days with all the privileges of Saint Giles's fair at Winchester Anders Hist Com i In the year the eighteenth of Henry the second the fermier of the city of Winchester paid twenty pounds to Ailward chamberlain of Winchester castle to buy a robe at this fair for the king's son and divers silver implements for a chapel in the castle Madox Exch p It appears from a curious record now remaining containing  The Estab  ishment and Expences of the houshold  of Henry Percy fifth earl of Northumberland in the year and printed by doctor Percy that the stores of his lordship's house at Wresille for the whole year were laid in from fairs  "He that standes charged with my lordes house for the houll yeir if he may possible  shall be at all  FAIRES where the groice emptions shall be boughte for the house for the houlle yeire as wine wax beiffes multons wheite and maltie"  p This last quotation is a proof that fairs still continued to be the principal marts for purchasing necessaries in large quantities which now are supplied by frequent trading towns and the mention of  beiffes  and  ultons  which were salted oxen and sheep shews that at so late a period they knew but little of breeding cattle Their ignorance of so important an article of husbandry is also an evidence that in the reign of Henry the eighth the state of population was much lower among us than we may imagine  In the statutes of Saint Mary Ottery's college in Devonshire given by bishop Grandison the founder the stewards and sacrist are ordered to purch  se annually two hundred pounds of wax for the choir of the college at this fair  "Cap lxviiPro luminaribus vero omnibus supradictis inveniendis etiam statuimus quod senescalli scaccarii per visum et auxilium sacriste omni anno in NUNDINIS WYNTON vel alibi apud Toryngton et in partibus Barnstepol ceram sufficientem quam ad ducentas

in Warwickshire and of Bicester in Oxfordshire under the reign of Henry the sixth the monks appear to have laid in yearly stores of various yet common necessaries at the fair of Sturbridge in Cambridgeshire at least one hundred miles distant from either monastery It may seem surprising that their own neighbourhood including the cities of Oxford and Coventry could not supply them with commodities neither rare nor costly which they thus fetched at a considerable expence of carriage It is a rubric in some o  the monastic rules  De Euntibus ad Nundinas  See Dugd Mon Angl ii p It is

help taking notice of a passage in Piers Plowman which shews how the reigning passion for chivalry infected the ideas and expressions of the writers of this period The poet is describing the crucifixion and speaking of the person who pierced our Saviour's side with a spear This person our author calls  a knight  and says that he came forth  "with his spere in hand and j  sted with Jesus"  Afterwards for doing so base an act as that of wounding a dead body he is pronounced a disgrace to  knighthood  and our  "Champion chevaler c  se knyght"  is ordered to  yield  himself  recreant  fol lxxxviii b This knight's name is Longis and he is blind but receives his sight from the blood which springs from our Saviour's side This miracle is recorded in the GOLDEN LEGENDE He is called Longias

foule  l xlii a    It would be tedious to transcribe other strokes of humour with which this poem abounds Before one of the Visions the poet falls asleep while he is bidding his beads  n another he

is made by SLOTH who conducts an army of more than a thousand prelates  It is not improbable that Longland here had his eye on the old French ROMAN D' ANTECHRIST a poem written by Huon de Meri about the year The author of this piece supposes that Antichrist is on earth that he visits every profession and order of life and finds numerous partisans The VICES arrange themselves under the banner of ANTECHRIST and the VIRTUES under that of CHRIST  These two armies at length come to an engagement and the battle ends to the honour of the Virtues and th  total defeat of the Vices The BANNER OF ANTICHRIST has before occurred in our quotations from Longland The title of Huon de Meri's poem deserves notice It is TURNOYEMENT DE L' ANTECHRIST These are the concluding lines  Par son droit nom a peau cet livre  Qui tresbien s' avorde a l' escrit  Le  Tournoiement de l' Antechrist  The author appears to have been a monk of St Germain des Pres near Paris This allegory is much like that which we find in the old dramatic MORALITIES The theology of the middle ages abounded with conjectures and controversies concerning Antichrist who at a very early period was commonly believed to be the Roman pontiff  See this topic discussed with singular penetration and perspicuity by doctor Hurd in TWELVE SERMONS INTRODUCTORY TO THE STUDY OF THE PROPHECIES Lond p seq    SECT IX  TO the VISION OF PIERCE PLOWMAN has been commonly annexed a poem called PIERCE THE PLOWMAN'S CREDE and which may properly be considered as its appendage  The first edition is by R Wolfe London  to  In four sheets It was reprinted and added to Rogers's or the fourth edition of the  Vision  It was evidently written after the year Wickliffe died in that year and he is mentioned as no longer living in Signat C ii edit Walter Britte or Brit  e a follower of Wickliffe is also mentioned Signat C iii Britte is placed by Bale in Cent vi See also Fuller's Worth p  Wales  The reader will pardon this small anticipation for the sake of connection  It is professedly written in imitation of our VISION but by a different hand The author in the character of a plain uninformed person pretends to be ignorant of his creed to be instructed in the articles of which he applies by turns to the four orders of mendicant friers This circumstance affords an obvious occasion of exposing in lively colours the tricks of those societies After so unexpected a disappointment he meets one Pierce or Peter a plowman who resolves his doubts and teaches him the principles of true religion In a copy of the CREDE lately presented to me by the bishop of Gloucester and once belonging to Mr Pope the latter in his own hand has inserted the following abstract of its plan  "An ignorant plain man having learned his Paternoster and Avemary wants to learn his creed He asks several religious men of the several orders to teach it him First of a friar Minor who bids him beware of the Carmelites and assures him they can teach him nothing describing their faults c But that the friars Minors shall save him whether he learns his creed or not  He goes next to the friars Preachers whose magnificent monastery he describes there he meets a fat friar who declaims against the Augustines He is shocked at his pride and goes to the Augustines They rail at the Minorites He goes to the Carmes they abuse the Dominicans but promise him salvation without the creed for money He leaves them with indignation and finds an honest poor PLOWMAN in the field and tells him how he was disappointed by the four orders The plowman answers with a long invective against them"  The language of the CREDE is less embarrassed and obscure than that of the VISION But before I proceed to a specimen it may not be perhaps improper to prepare the reader by giving an outline of the constitution and character of the four orders of mendicant friars the object of our poet's satire an enquiry in many respects connected with the general purport of this history and which in this place at least cannot be deemed a digression as it will illustrate the main subject and explain many particular passages of the PLOWMAN'S CREDE  And of some perhaps quoted above from the VISION    Long before the thirteenth century the monastic orders as we have partly seen in the preceding poem in consequence of their ample revenues had degenerated from their primitive austerity and were totally given up to luxury and indolence Hence they became both unwilling and unable to execute the purposes of their establishment to instruct the people to check the growth of heresies or to promote in any respect the true interests of the church They forsook all their religious obligations despised the authority of their superiors and were abandoned without shame or remorse to every species of dissipation and licentiousness About the beginning therefore of the thirteenth century the condition and circumstances of the church rendered it absolutely necessary  to remedy these evils by introducing a new order of religious who being destitute of fixed possessions by the severity of their manners a professed contempt of riches and an unwearied perseverance in the duties of preaching and prayer might restore respect to the monastic institution and recover the honours of the church These were the four orders of mendicant or begging friars commonly denominated the Franciscans the Dominicans the Carmelites and the Augustines  The Franciscans were often styled friarsminors or minorites and greyfriars the Dominicans friarspreachers and sometimes blackfriars The Carmelites whitefriars and the Austins greyfriars The first establishment of the Dominicans in England was at Oxford in Of the Franciscans at Canterbury These two were the most eminent of the four orders The Dominican friary at Oxford stood in an island on the south of the city southwest of the Franciscan friary the site of which is hereafter described    These societies soon surpassed all the rest not only in the purity of their lives but in the number of their privileges and the multitude of their members Not to mention the success which attends all novelties their reputation arose quickly to an amazing height The popes among other uncommon immunities allowed them the liberty of travelling wherever they pleased of conversing with persons of all ranks of instructing the youth and the people in general and of hearing confessions without reserve or restriction and as on these occasions which gave them opportunities of appearing in public and conspicuous situations they exhibited more striking marks of gravity and sanctity than were observable in the deportment and conduct of the members of other monasteries they were regarded with the highest esteem and veneration throughout all the countries of Europe  In the mean time they gained still greater respect by cultivating the literature then in vogue with the greatest assiduity and success Gianoni says that most of the theological  professors in the university of Naples newly founded in the year were chosen from the mendicants  Hist Nap xvi  They were the principal teachers of theology at Paris the school where this science had received its origin  See Boul Hist Academ Paris iii p c  At Oxford and Cambridge respectively all the four orders had flourishing monasteries The most learned scholars in the university of Oxford at the close of the thirteenth century were Franciscan friars and long after this period the Franciscans appear to have been the sole support and ornament of that university  This circumstance in some degree roused the monks from their indolence and induced the greater monasteries to procure the foundation of small colleges in the universities for the education of their novices At Oxford the monks had also schools which bore the name of their respective orders and there were schools in that university which were appropriated to particular monasteries Kennet's Paroch Ant p Wood Hist Ant Univ Oxon i Leland says that even in his time  t Stamford a temporary university the names of halls inhabited by the novices of Peterborough Sempringham and Vauldrey abbies were remaining Itin vi p And it appears that the greater part of the proceeders in theology at Oxford and Cambridge just before the reformation were monks But we do not find that in consequence of all these efforts the monks made a much greater figure in literature  In this rivalry which subsisted between the mendicants and the monks the latter sometimes availed themselves of their riches and with a view to attract popularity and to eclipse the growing lustre of the former proceeded to their degrees in the universities with prodigious parade In the year William de Brooke a Benedictine of Saint Peter's abbey at Gloucester took the degree of doctor in divinity at Oxford He was attended on this important occasion by the abbot and whole convent of Gloucester the abbots of Westminster Reading Abingdon Evesham and Malmesbury with one hundred noblemen and esquires on horses richly caparisoned These were entertained at a sumptuous feast in the refectory of Gloucester college But it should be observed that he was the first of the Benedictine order that attained this dignity Wood Hist Ant Univ Oxon i col See also Stevens Mon  Hence it was that bishop Hugh de Balsham founder of Peterhouse at Cambridge orders in his statutes given about the year that some of his scholars should annually repair to Oxford for improvement in the sciences  "De scholaribus emittendis ad universitatem Oxonie pro doctrina"  Cap xviii  That is to study under the Franciscan readers Such was the eminence of the Franciscan friary at Oxford that the learned bishop Grosthead in the year bequeathed all  his books to that celebrated seminary  Leland Script Brit p This house stood just without the city walls near Littlegate The garden called  Paradise  was their grove or orchard  This was the house in which the renowned Roger Bacon was educated who revived in the midst of barbarism and brought to a considerable degree of perfection the knowledge of mathematics in England and greatly facilitated many modern discoveries in experimental philosophy  It is probable that the treatises of many of Bacon's scholars and followers collected by Thomas Allen in the reign of James the first still remain among the manuscripts of Sir Kenelm Digby in the Bodleian library  The same fraternity is likewise said to have stored their valuable library with a multitude of Hebrew manuscrips which they purchased of the Jews on their banishment from England  Wood ubi supr col  Richard de Bury bishop of Durham author of PHILOBIBLON and the founder of a library at Oxford is prolix in his praises of the mendicants for their extraordinary diligence in collecting books  Philobibl cap v This book was written  Indeed it became difficult in the beginning of the fourteenth century to find any treatise in the arts theology or

which might be given of the learning of the mendicants there is one which greatly contributed to establish their literary character In the eleventh century Aristotle's philosophy had been condemned in the university of Paris as heretical About a hundred years afterwards these prejudices began to subside and new translations of Aristotle's writings were published in Latin by our countryman Michael Scotus and others with more attention to the original Greek at least without the pompous and perplexed circumlocutions which appeared in the Arabic versions hitherto used In the mean time the mendicant orders sprung up who happily availing themselves of these new translations and making them the constant subject of their scholastic lectures were the first who revived the doctrines of this philosopher and acquired the merit of having opened a new system of science  See Joann Laun de varia Aristotel Fortun in Acad Paris p edit Paris  The Dominicans of Spain were accomplished adepts in

preachers The three kings appeared crowned on three great horses r  chly habited surrounded by pages bodyguards and an innumerable retinue A golden star was exhibited in the sky going before them They proceeded to the pillars of S Lawrence where king H  rod was represented with his s  ribes and wisemen The three kings ask Herod where Christ should be born and his wisemen having consulted their books answer him at Bethlehem On which the three kings with their golden crowns having in their hands golden cups filled with frankincense myrrh and gold the star still going before marched to the church of S Eustorgius with all their attendants preceeded by trumpets and horns apes baboons and a great variety of animals In the church on one side of the high altar there was a manger with an ox and an ass and in it the infant Christ in the arms of his mother Here the three kings offer their gifts c The concourse of the people of knights ladi  s and ec  l  iastics was such as never before was

monasteries especially in England were remarkably magnificent and commonly much exceeded those of the endowed convents of the second magnitude As these fraternities were professedly poor and could not from their original institution receive estates the munificence of their benefactors was employed in adorning their houses with stately refectories and churches and for these and other purposes they did nor want address to procure multitudes of patrons which was facilitated by the notion of their superior sanctity It was fashionable for persons of the highest rank to bequeath their bodies to be buried in the friary churches which were consequently filled with sumptuous shrines and superb monuments  Their churches were esteemed more sacred than others  In the  noble church of the Grey friars in London finished in the year but long since destroyed four queens besides upwards of six hundred persons of quality were buried whose beautiful tombs remained till the dissolution  Weav Fun Mon p  These interments imported considerable sums of money into the mendicant societies It is probable that they derived more benefit from casual charity than they would have gained from a regular endowment The Franciscans indeed enjoyed from the popes the privilege of distributing indulgences a valuable indemnification for their voluntary poverty  See Baluz Miscellan tom iv vii    On the whole two of these mendicant institutions the Dominicans and the Franciscans for the space of near three centuries appear to have governed the European church and state with an absolute and universal sway they filled during that period the most eminent ecclesiastical and civil stations taught in the universities with an authority which silenced all opposition and maintained the disputed prerogative of the Roman pontiff against the united influence of prelates and kings with a vigour only to be paralleled by its success The Dominicans and Franciscans were before the Reformation exactly what the Jesuits have been since They disregarded their monastic character and profession and were employed not only in spiritual matters but in temporal affairs of the greatest consequence in composing the differences of princes concluding treaties of peace and concerting alliances they presided in cabinet councils levied national subsidies influenced courts and managed the machines of every important operation and event both in the religious and political world  From what has been here said it is natural to suppose that the mendicants at length became universally odious The high esteem in which they were held and the transcendent degree of authority which they had assumed only served to  render them obnoxious to the clergy of every rank to the monasteries of other orders and to the universities It was not from ignorance but from a knowledge of mankind that they were active in propagating superstitious notions which they knew were calculated to captivate the multitude and to strengthen the papal interest yet at the same time from the vanity of displaying an uncommon sagacity of thought and a superior skill in theology they affected novelties in doctrine which introduced dangerous errors and tended to shake the pillars of orthodoxy Their ambition was unbounded and their arrogance intolerable Their encreasing numbers became in many states an enormous and unweildy burthen to the commonwealth They had abused the powers and privileges which had been entrusted to them and the common sense of mankind could not long be blinded or deluded by the palpable frauds and artifices which these rapacious zealots so notoriously practised for enriching their convents In England the university of Oxford resolutely resisted the perpetual encroachments of the Dominicans  Wood ut supr i  and many of our theologists attacked all the four orders with great vehemence and severity Exclusive of the jealousies and animosities which naturally subsisted between four rival institutions their visionary refinements and love of disputation introduced among them the most violent dissensions The Dominicans aimed at popularity by an obstinate denial of the immaculate conception Their pretended sanctity became at length a term of reproach and their learning fell into discredit As polite letters and general knowledge encreased their speculative and pedantic divinity gave way to a more liberal turn of thinking and a more perspicuous mode of writing Bale who was himself a Carmelite friar says that his order which was eminently distinguished for scholastic erudition began to lose their estimation about the year Some of them were imprudent  enough to engage openly in political controversy and the Augustines destroyed all their repute and authority in England by seditious sermons in which they laboured  o supplant the progeny of Edward the fourth and to establish the title of the usurper Richard  Newcourt Repert i  About the year Leland visited the Franciscan friary at Oxford big with the hopes of finding in their celebrated library if not many valuable books at least those which had been bequeathed by the learned bishop Grosthead The delays and difficulties with which he procured admittance into this venerable repository heightened his curiosity and expectations At length after much ceremony being permitted to enter instead of an inestimable treasure he saw little more than empty shelves covered with cobwebs and dust  Leland describes this adventure with some humour  "Contigit ut copiam peterem videndi bibliothecam Franciscanorum ad quod obstreperunt asini aliquot rudentes nulli prorsus mortalium tam sanctos aditus et recessus adire nisi Gardiano  et sacris sui collegii baccalariis Sed ego urgebam et principis diplomate munitus tantum

and tendency of which will now be easily understood and especially as this poem is not only extremely scarce and has almost the rarity of a manuscript but as it is so curious and lively a picture of

the puritans against ecclesiastical establishments v Urr edit  For Christ made no cathedralls  Ne with him was no Cardinalls  But see what follows concerning Wickliffe  All these poems were for the

passage from Wickliffe's tract entitled WHY POOR PRIESTS HAVE NO BENEFICES Lewis  App Num xix p  "And yet they lords wolen not present a clerk able of kunning of god's law but a kitchen clerk or a penny clerk or  wise in buil  ing castle    or worldly doing though he kunne not reade well his sauter c"  Here is a manifest piece of satire on Wykeham bishop of Winche  er Wickliffe's cotemporary who is supposed to have recommended himself to Edward the third by rebuilding the castle of Windsor This was a recent and notorious instance But in this appointment the king probably paid a compliment to that prelate's singular talents for business his activity circumspection and management rather than to any scientific and professed skill in architecture which he might have possessed It seems to me that he was only a supervisor or comptroller on this occasion It was common to depute churchmen to this department from an idea of their superior prudence and probity Thus John the prior of St Swithin's at Winchester in is commissioned by brief from the king to supervise large repairs done by the sheriff in the castle of Winchester and the royal manor of Wolmer MS Registr Priorat Quat fol The bishop of S David's was master of the works at building King's College Hearne's Elmh p Alcock bishop of Ely was comptroller of the royal buildings under Henry the seventh Parker Hist Cambr p He

clerk was master of the works at Cardinal College MS Twyne f Se  also Walpole i Anecd Paint p  who maintained  among other things that the clergy should not possess estates that the ecclesiastical ceremonies obstructed true devotion and that mendicant friars the particular object of our Plowman's CREDE were a public and insupportable grievance But Wickliffe whom Mr Hume pronounces to have been an enthusiast like many other reformers carried his ideas of purity too far and as at least it appears from the two first of these opinions under the design of destroying superstition his undistinguishing zeal attacked even the necessary aids of religion It was certainly a lucky circumstance that Wickliffe quarrelled with the pope His attacks on superstition at first probably proceeded from resentment Wickliffe who was professor of divinity at Oxford finding on many occasions not only his own province invaded but even the privileges of the university frequently violated by the pretensions of the mendicants gratified his warmth of temper by throwing out some slight censures against all the four orders and the popes their principal patrons and abettors Soon afterwards he was deprived of the wardenship of Canterbury hall by the archbishop of Canterbury who substituted a monk in his place Upon this he appealed to the pope who confirmed the archiepiscopal sentence by way of rebuke for the freedom with which he had treated the monastic profession Wickliffe highly exasperated at this usage immediately gave a loose to his indignation and without restraint or distinction attacked  in numerous sermons and treatises not only the scandalous enormities of the whole body of monks but even the usurpations of the pontifical power itself with other ecclesiastical corruptions Having exposed these palpable abuses with a just abhorrence he ventured still farther and proceeded to examine and refute with great learning and penetration the absurd doctrines which prevailed in the religious system of his age he not only exhorted the laity to study the scriptures but translated the bible into English for general use and popular inspection Whatever were his motives it is certain t  at these efforts enlarged the notions of mankind and sowed those seeds of a revolution in religion which were quickened at length and brought to maturity by a favourable coincidence of circumstances in an age when the encreasing growth of literature and curiosity naturally led the way to innovation and improvement But a visible diminution of the authority of the ecclesiastics in England at least had been long growing from other causes The disgust which the laity had contracted from the numerous and arbitrary encroachments both of the court of Rome and of their own clergy had greatly weaned the kingdom from superstition and conspicuous symptoms had appeared on various occasions of a general desire to shake off the intolerable bondage of papal oppression  SECT X  LONGLAND'S peculiarity of style and versification seems to have had many cotemporary imitators One of these is a nameless author on the fashionable history of Alexander the Great and his poem on this subject is inserted at the end of the beautiful Bodleian copy of the French ROMAN D'ALEXANDRE before mentioned with this reference  See above p It is in a different hand yet with Saxon characters See ad calc cod

PLOWMAN'S VISIONS  c  Notwithstanding what has been supposed above it is not quite certain that Longland was the first who led the way in this singular species of versification His VISION was written on a popular subject and is the only poem composed in this capricious sort of metre which has been printed It is easy to conceive how these circumstances contributed to give him the merit of an inventor on this occasion  The ingenious doctor Percy has exhibited specimens of two or three other poems belonging to this class  Essay on the Metr of P P Vis p seq  One of these is entitled DEATH AND LIFE it consists of two hundred and twentynine lines and is divided into two parts or  Fitts  It begins thus  Christ christen king that on the cross tholed  Hadde paines and passyons to defend our soules  Give us grace on the ground the greatlye to serve  For that royall red blood that rann from thy side  The subject of this piece is a VISION containing a contest for superiority between  Our lady Dame  LIFE and the  ugly fiend  Dame  DEATH who with their several attributes and concomitants are personified in a beautiful vein of allegorical painting  Dame  LIFE is thus forcibly described  Shee was brighter of her blee than was the bright sonn  Her rud redder than the rose that on the rise hangeth  Meekely smiling with her mouth and merry in her lookes  Ever laughing for love as shee like would  And as she came by the bankes the boughes eche one  They lowted to that ladye and layd forth their branches  Blossomes and burgens breathed full sweete  Flowers flourished in the frith where she forth stepped  And the grasse that was gray grened belive  The figure of DEATH follows which is equally bold and expressive Another piece of this kind also quoted by doctor Percy is entitled CHEVELERE ASSIGNE or DE CIGNE that is the  Knight of the Swan  This is a romance which is extant in a prose translation from the French among Mr Garrick's noble collection of old plays  K vol  "Imprinted at London by me Wylliam Copland"  There is an edition on parchment by W de Worde  "Newly translated out of Frenshe into Englyshe at thinstigacion of the puyssaunt prynce lorde Edward duke

CHEVALIER AU SIGNE  E vi fol And in the Royal library at Paris MS  "Le Roman du Chevalier au Cigne en vers"  Montf Cat MSS ii p  Our English poem begins thus  See MSS Cott CALIG A i f    Allweldynge

is professedly confined to England yet I cannot pass over two Scotch poets of this period who have adorned the English language by a strain of versification expression and poetical imagery far superior to their age and who consequently deserve to be mentioned in a general review of the progress of our national poetry They have written two heroic poems One of them is John Barbour archdeacon of Aberdeen He was educated at Oxford and Rymer has printed an instrument for his safe passage into England in order to prosecute his studies in that university in the years and  Fo  d vi  David Bruc  king of Scotland gave him a pension for life as a reward for his poem called the HISTORY OF ROBERT BRUCE KING OF THE SCOTS  Tanner Bibl p  It was printed at Glasgow in the year    mo    A battle  ought by lord Douglas is thus described  When that thus thir two batttles were  Assembled as I said you air  The Stewart Walter that then was  And the good lord als of Dowglas  In a battle when that they saw  The earl foroutten dread or aw  Assemble with his company  On all that folk so sturdily  For to help him they held their way  And their battle with good array  Beside the earl a little by  They sembled all so hardily  That their foes felt ther coming well  For with weapons stallwort of steel  They dang on them with all their might  Their foes received well I heght  With swords and spears and als with mass  The battle there so fellon was  And so right great spilling of blood  That on the erd the slouces stood  The Scottishmen so well them bare  And so great slaughter made they there  And fra so feil the lives they reav'd  That all the field was bloody leav'd  That time that thir three battles were  All side by side fighting well near  There might men hear many a dint  And weapons upon arms stint  And might see tumble knights and steeds  And many rich and royal weeds  Foully defiled under feet  Some held on loft some tint the suet  A long while fighting thus they were  That men in no wise might hear there  Men might hear nought but groans and dints  That flew as men strike fire on flints  They fought ilk ane so eagerly  That they made neither noise nor cry  But dang on other at their might  With weapons that were burnisht bright  The arrows also thick there flaw  That they well might say that them saw  That they a hideous shower can ma  For where they fe  l I underta  They left after them tokening  That shall need as I trow leeching  The English archers shot so fast  That might their shot have any last  It had been hard to Scottishmen  But king Robert that well can ken  That their archers were perillous  And their shot right hard and grievous  Ordain'd forouth the assembly  His marshal with a great menʒie  Five hundred armed into steel  That on light horse were horsed well  For to prick amongst the archers  And to assail them with their spears  That they no leisure have to shoot  This marshal that I hereof mute  Sir Robert of Keith he was call'd  And I before here have you tould  When that he saw the battles so  Assemble and together go  And saw the archers shoot stoutly  With all them of his company  In hy upon them can he ride  And overtake them at a side  And rush'd among them so rudely  Sticking them so despiteously  And in lik fusion bearing down  And slaying them forout ransoun  That they them skailed e'erilkane  And fra that time forth ther  was nan  That assembled shot for to ma  When Scots archers saw that they sa  Reboted were they wax'd hardy  And with their might shot eagerly  Among the horfemen that there rade  And wounds wide to them they made  And slew of them a full great deal  They bore them hardily and well  For fra tbat their foes archers were  Skailed as I said to you air  They more than they were b  great thing  So that they dread not their shooting  They wax'd so hardy that them thought  They should set all their foes at nought  p    The following is a specimen of our author's talent at rural

Johnstoun  With this dead corps to burying made it bown  Parted their men syne divers ways they rode  A great power at Doplin still there bode  To Dalwryeth the Butler past but let  At sundry fords the gate they unbeset  To keep the wood while it wa day they thought  As Wallace thus in the thick forest sought  For his two men in mind he had great pain  He wist not well if they were tane or slain  Or scaped haill by any jeopardy  Thirteen were left with him no more had he  In the Gaskhall their lodging have they tane  Fire got they soon but meat then had they nane  Two sheep they took beside them of a fold  Ordain'd to sup into that seemly hold  Graithed in haste some food for them to dight  So heard they blow rude horns upon hight  Two sent he forth to look what it might be  They bode right long and no tidings heard he  But bousteous noise so bryvely blowing fast  So other two into the wood forth past  None came again but bousteously can blaw  Into great ire he sent them forth on raw  When that alone Wallace was leaved there  The awful blast abounded meikle mare  Then trow'd he well they had his lodging seen  His sword he drew of noble metal keen  Syne forth he went where at he heard the horn  Without the door Fawdoun was him beforn  As to his sight his own head in his hand  A cross he made when he saw him so stand  At Wallace in the head he swakked there  And he in haste soon hint it by the hair  Syne out again at him he could it cast  Into his heart he greatly was agast  Right well he trow'd that was do sprit of man  It was some devil that sic malice began  He wist uo wale there longer for to bide  Up through the hail thus wight Wallace can glide  To a close stair the boards they rave in twin  Fifteen foot large he lap out of that inn  Up the water he suddenly could fare  Again he blink'd what pearance he saw there  He thought he saw Fawdoun that ugly  ire  That haiil hall he had set into a fire  A great rafter he had into his hand  Wallace as then no longer would he stand  Of his good men full great marvel had he  How they were tint through his feil fantasie  Trust right well that all this was sooth indeed  Suppose that it no point be of the creed  Power they had with Lucifer that fell  The time when he parted from heaven to hell  By sik mischief if his men might be lost  Drowned or slain among the English host  Or what it was in likeness of Fawdoun  Which brought his men to sudden confusion  Or if the man ended in ill intent  Some wicked sprit again for him present  I cannot speak of sik divinity  To clerks I will let all sic matters be  But of Wallace now forth I will you tell  When he was won out of that peril fell  Right glad was he that he had scaped sa  But for his men great mourning can he ma  Flait by himself to the Maker above  Why he suffer'd he should sik paining prove  He wist not well if that it was God  s will  Right or wrong his fortune to fulfil  Had he pleas'd God he trow'd it might not be  He should him thole in sik perplexitie  But great courage in his mind ever drawe  Of Englishmen thinking amends to have  As he was thus walking by him alone  Upon Ern side making a piteous moan  Sir John Butler to watch the fords right  Out from his men of Wallace had a sight  The mist again to the mountains was gone  To him he rode where that he made his mone  On loud he speir'd What art thou walks that gate  A true man Sir though my voyage be late  Erands I pass from Down unto my lord  Sir John Stewart the right for to record  In Down is now newly come from the king  Then Butler said this is a selcouth thing  You lied all out you have been with Wallace  I shall thee know ere you come off this place  To him he start the courser wonder wight  Drew out a sword so made him for to light  Above the knee good Wallace has him tane  Through thigh and brawn in sunder strake the bane  Derfly to dead the knight fell on the land  Wallace the horse soon seized in his hand  An ackward stroke syne took him in that stead  His craig in two thus was the Butler dead  An Englishman saw their chiftain was slain  A spear in rest he cast with all his main  On Wallace drave from the horse him to bear  Warily he wrought as worthy man in wear  The spear he wan withouten more abode  On horse he lap and through a great rout rode  To Dalwryeth he knew the ford full well  Before him came feil stuffed in fine steel  He strake the first but bade on the blasoun  While horse and man both fleet the water down  Another soon down from his horse he bare  Stamped to ground and drown'd withouten mare  The third he hit in his harness of steel  Throughout the cost the spear it brake some deal  The great power then  fter him can ride  He saw no waill there longer for to bide  His burnisht brand braithly in hand he bare  Whom he hit right they followed him na mare  To stuff the chase feil freiks followed fast  But Wallace made the gayest ay agast  The muir he took and through their power yeed  The horse was good but yet he had great dread  For failing ere he wan unto a strength  The chase was great skail'd over breadth and length  Through strong danger they had him ay in sight  At the Blackford there Wallace down can light  His horse stuffed for way was deep and lang  A large great mile wightly on foot could gang  Ere he was hors'd riders about him cast  He saw full well long so he might not last  Sad men indeed upon him can renew  With returning that night twenty he slew  The fiercest ay rudely rebuted he  Keeped his horse and right wisely can flee  While that he came the mickest muir amang  His horse gave over and would no further gang  p    I will close these specimens with an instance of our author's allegorical invention  In that slumber coming him thought he saw  An aged man fast toward him could draw  Soon by the hand he hint him hastily  I am he said in voyage charg'd with thee  A sword him gave of basely burnisht steel  Good son he said this wand you shall bruik well  Of topaz stone him thought the plummet was  Both hilt and hand all glittering like the glass  Dear son he said we tarry here too long  Thou shalt go see where wrought is meikle wrong  Then he him led to a mountain on hight  The world him thought he might see at a sight  He left him there syne soon from him he went  Thereof Wallace studied in his intent  To see him more he had still great desire  Therewith he saw begin a fellon fire  Which braithly burnt in breadth through all the land  Scotland all over from Ross to Solwaysand  Then soon to him there descended a queen  Illuminate light shining full bright and

therefore be out of all despair  Further as now hereof I can na mare  About the present period historical romances of recent events seem to have commenced Many of these appear to have been written by heralds  See Le Pere Mene  rier Cheval Ancien c v p Par  mo    In the library of Worcester college at Oxford there is a poem in French reciting the atchievements of Edward the Black Prince who died in the year It is in the short verse of romance and was written by the prince's herald who attended close by his person in all his battles according to the established mode of those times This was John Chandoisherald frequently mentioned in Froissart In this piece which is of considerable length the names of the Englishmen are properly spelled the chronology exact and the epitaph  It is a fair and beautiful manuscript on vellum It is an oblong octavo and formerly belonged to Sir William Le Neve Clarencieux herald  forming a sort of peroration to the narrative the same as was ordered by the prince in his will  The hero's epitaph is frequent in romances In the French romance of SAINTRE written about this time hi  epitaph is introduced  This poem indeed may seem to claim no place here because it happens to be written in the French language yet exclusive of its subject a circumstance I have mentioned that it was composed by a herald deserves particular attention and throws no small illustration on the poetry of this era There are several proofs which indicate that many romances of the fourteenth century if not in verse at least those written  n  p  in prose were the work of heralds As it was their duty to attend their masters in battle they were enabled to record the most important transactions of the field with fidelity It was customary to appoint none to this office but persons of discernment address experience and some degree of education  Le Pere Menestrier Cheval Ancien  t supr p ch v  "Que l'on croyoit avoir  l'Esprit  c"  Feron says that they gave this attendance in order to make a true report L'Instit des Roys et Herauds p a See also Favin p See a curious description in Froissart of an interview between the Chandois herald mentioned above and a marshal of France where they enter into a warm and very ser  ous disput  concerning the  devices d'amour  borne by each army Liv i ch  At solemn tournaments they made an essential part of the ceremony Here they had an opportunity of observing acoutrements armorial distinctions the number and appearance of the spectators together with the various events of the turney to the best advantage and they were afterwards obliged to compile an ample register of this strange mixture of foppery and ferocity  "L'un des principaux fonctions des Herautes d'armes etoit se trouver au jousts c ou ils gardoient

Perceforest xi  They were necessarily connected with the minstrells at public festivals and thence acquired a facility of reciting adventures A learned French antiquary is of opinion that antiently the French heralds called  Hiraux  were the same as the minstrells and that they sung metrical tales at festivals  Carpentier Suppl DuCang Gloss Lat p tom ii  They frequently received fees or largesse in common with the minstrells  Thus at St George's feast at Windsor we have  "Diversis heraldis et ministrallis c"  Ann Ric ii Hen vi Apud Anstis Ord Gart i  And again  Exit Pell M ann Edw iii

into different countries and saw the fashions of foreign courts and foreign tournaments They not only committed to writing the process of the lists but it was also their  business at magnificent feasts to describe the number and parade of the dishes the quality of the guests the brilliant dresses of the ladies the courtesy of the knights the revels disguisings banquets and every other occurrence most observable in the course of the solemnity Spenser alludes expressly to these heraldic details where he mentions the splendor of Florimel's wedding  To tell the glory of the feast that day  The goodly servyse the devisefull sights  The bridegrome's state the bride's most rich array  The pride of ladies and the worth of knights  The royall banquettes and the rare delights  Were work fit for an HERALD not for me  Q v iii      I suspect that Chaucer not perhaps without ridicul  glances at some of these descriptions with which his age abounded and which he probably regarded with less reverence and read with less edification than did the generality of his cotemporary readers  Why shulde I tellen of the rialte  Of that wedding or which course goth beforn  Who blowith in a

In the FLOURE and the LEAF the same poet has described in eleven long stanzas the procession to a splendid tournament with all the prolixity and exactness of a herald  From v to v  The same affectation derived from the same sources occurs often in Ariosto  It were easy to illustrate this doctrine by various examples The famous French romance of SAINTRE was evidently the performance of a herald John De Saintre the knight of the piece was a real person and according to Froissart was taken prisoner at the battle of Poitiers in the year  Froissart  Hist i p  But the compiler confounds chronology and ascribes to his hero many pieces of true history belonging to others This was a common practice in these books Some authors have supposed that this romance appeared before the year  Bysshe Not in Upton Milit Offic p Menestrier Orig Arm p  But there are reasons to prove that it was written by Antony de la Sale a Burgundian author of a book of CEREMONIES from his name very quaintly

have not seen any French romance which has preserved the practices of chivalry more copiously than this of SAINTRE It must have been an absolute masterpiece for the rules of tilting martial customs and public ceremonies prevailing in its author's age In the library of the Office of Arms there remains a very accurate description of a feast of Saint George celebrated at Windsor in  MSS O  ic Arm M fol  It appears to have been written by the herald Bluemantle Poursuivant Menestrier says that Guillaume Rucher herald of Henault has left a large treatise describing the tournaments annually celebrated at Lisle in Flanders  "Guillaume Rucher heraut d'armes du titre de Heynaut a fait  un gros volume  des rois de l'Epinette a Lisle  n Flanders c'est une ceremonie ou un feste dont il a

the monuments which accompany these statutes was built  at the foot of the obscure grot of the  ENCHANTMENTS of Virgil The statutes are as extraordinary as if they had been drawn up by Don Quixote himself or his assessors the curate and the barber From the seventh chapter we learn that the knights who came to this yearly festival at the  chat  l de l'euf  were obliged to deliver in writing to the clerks of the chapel of the castle their yearly adventures Such of these histories as were thought worthy to be recorded the clerks are ordered to transcribe in a book which was called  Le livre des av  n  ments aux chevaliers  c  Et demerra le dit livre toujours en la dicte chapelle  This sacred register certainly furnished from time to time ample materials to the romancewriters And this circumstance gives a new explanation to a reference which we so frequently find in romances I mean that appeal which they so constantly make to some authentic record    The pompous circumstances of which these heraldic narratives consisted and the minute prolixity with which they were displayed seem to have infected the professed historians of this age Of this there are various instances in Froissart who had no other design than to compile a chronicle of real facts I will give one example out of many At a treaty of marriage between our Richard the second and Isabel daughter of Charles the fifth king of France the two monarchs attended with a noble retinue met and formed several encampments in a spacious plain near the castle of Guynes Froissart expends many pages in relating at large the costly furniture of the pavilions the riches of the sideboards the profusion and variety of sumptuous liquors spices and dishes with their order of service the number of the attendants with their address and exact discharge of duty in their respective offices the presents of gold and precious stones made on both sides and a thousand other particulars of equal importance relating to the parade of this royal interview  See Froissart's CRONYCLE translated by Lord Berners Pinson vol ii f  On this account Caxton in his exhortation to the knights of his age ranks Froissart's history as a book of chivalry with the romances of Lancelot and Percival and recommends it to their attention as a manual equally calculated to inculcate  the knightly virtues of courage and courtesy  Boke of the

barons vied with one another in the lustre of their shews when tournaments coronations royal interviews and solemn festivals were the grand objects of mankind Froissart was an eyewitness of many of

was entertained for twelve weeks he presented to the earl his collection of the poems of the duke of Luxemburgh consisting of sonnets balades and virelays Among these was included a romance composed

notes on this article with the contradictory accounts of Mor  ri Vossius and others whose disputes might have been all easily settled by recurring to Froissart himself who has interspersed in his history many curious particulars relating to his own life and works    As we are approaching to Chaucer let us here stand still and take a retrospect of the general manners The tournaments and carousals of our antient princes by forming splendid assemblies of both sexes while they inculcated the most liberal sentiments of honour and heroism undoubtedly contributed to introduce ideas of courtesy and to encourage decorum Yet the national manners still retained a great degree of ferocity and the ceremonies of the most refined courts in Europe had often a mixture of barbarism which rendered them ridiculous This absurdity will always appear at periods when men are so far civilised as to have lost their native simplicity and yet have not attained just ideas of politeness and propriety Their luxury was inelegant their pleasures indelicate their pomp cumbersome and unwieldy In the mean time it may seem surprising that the many schools of philosophy which flourished in the middle ages should not have corrected and polished the times But as their religion was corrupted by superstition so their philosophy degenerated into sophistry Nor is it science alone even if founded on truth that will polish nations  For this purpose the powers of imagination must be awakened and exerted to teach elegant feelings and to heighten our natural sensibilities It is not the head only that must be informed but the heart must also be moved Many classic authors were known in the thirteenth century but the scholars of that period wanted taste to read and admire them The pathetic or sublime strokes of Virgil would be but little relished by theologists and metaphysicians  SECT XII  THE most illustrious ornament of the reign of Edward the third and of his successor Richard the second was Jeffrey Chaucer a poet with whom the history of our poetry is by many supposed to have commenced and who has been pronounced by a critic of unquestionable taste and discernment to be the first English versifier who wrote poetically  Johnson's DICTION Pref p  He was born in the year and educated at Oxford where he made a rapid progress in the scholastic sciences as they were then taught but the liveliness of his parts and the native gaiety of his disposition soon recommended him to the patronage of a magnificent monarch and rendered him a very popular and acceptable character in the brilliant court which I have above described In the mean time he added to his accomplishments by frequent tours into France and Italy which he sometimes visited under the advantages of a public character Hitherto our poets had been persons of a private and circumscribed education and the art of versifying like every other kind of composition had been confined to recluse scholars But Chaucer was a man of the world and from this circumstance we are to account in great measure for the many new embellishments which he conferred on our language and our poetry The descriptions of splendid processions and gallant carousals with which his works abound are a proof that he was conversant with the practices and diversions of polite life Familiarity with a variety of things and objects opportunities of acquiring the fashionable and courtly modes  of speech connections with the great at home and a personal acquaintance with the vernacular poets of foreign countries opened his mind and furnished him with new lights  The earl of Salisbury beheaded by Henry the fourth could not but patronise Chaucer I do not mean for political reasons The earl was a writer of verses and very fond of poetry On this account his acquaintance was much cultivated by the famous Christina of Pisa whose works both in prose and verse compose so considerable a part of the old French literature She used to call him  "Gracieux chevalier aimant dictiez et luimeme gracieux dicteur"  See M Boivin Mem Lit tom ii p seq  to  I have seen none of this earl's  Ditties  Otherwise he would have been here considered in form as an English poet  In Italy he was introduced to Petrarch at the wedding of Violante daughter of Galeazzo duke of Milan with the duke of Clarence and it is not improbable that Boccacio was of the party  Froissart was also present VIE DE PETRARQUE iii Amst  to  I believe Paulus Jovius is the first who me  tions this anecdote Vit Galeas ii p  Although Chaucer had undoubtedly studied the works of these celebrated writers and particularly of Dante before this fortunate interview yet it seems likely that these excursions gave him a new relish for their compositions and enlarged his knowledge of the Italian fables His travels likewise enabled him to cultivate the Italian and Provencial languages with the greatest success and induced him to polish the asperity and enrich the sterility of his native versification with softer cadences and a more copious and variegated phraseology In this attempt which was authorised by the recent and popular examples of Petrarch in Italy and Alain Chartier in France  Leland Script Brit  he was countenanced and assisted by his friend John Gower the early guide and encourager of his studies  Gower Confess Amant l v fol b Barthel  And grete wel Chaucer when ye mete  As my dis  ple and my poete  For in the flowers of his youth  In sundrie wise as he well couth  Of dites and of songes glade  The which he for my sake made  etc  The revival of learning in most countries appears to have first owed its rise to translation At rude periods the modes of original thinking are unknown and the arts of original composition have  not yet been studied The writers therefore of such periods are chiefly and very usefully employed in importing the ideas of other languages into their own They do not venture to think for themselves nor aim at the merit of inventors but they are laying the foundations of literature and while they are naturalising the knowledge of more learned ages and countries by translation they are imperceptibly improving the national language This has been remarkably the case not only in England but in France and Italy In the year John Trevisa canon of Westbury in Wiltshire and a great traveller not only finished a translation of the Old and New Testaments at the command of his munificent patron Thomas lord Berkley  See H Wharton Append Cav p  but also translated Higden's POLYCHRONICON and other Latin pieces  Such as Bartholomew Hantwille De  Propri  ta  ibus Rerum  lib xix Printed by Wynkyn de Worde fol And Vegetius  De Arte Militari  MSS Digb Bibl Bodl In the same manuscript is Aegidius Romanus  De R  gimine Principum  a translation probably by Trevisa He also translated some pieces of Richard Fitzralph archbishop of Armagh See supr p He wrote a tract prefixed to his version of the POLYCHRONICON on the utility of translations  De Utilitate Translationum Dialogus int  r Clericum et Patronum  See more of his translations in MSS Harl I do not find his ENGLISH BIBLE in any of our libraries nor do I believe that any copy of it now remains Caxton mentions it in the preface to his edition of the English POLYCHRONICON  But these translations would have been alone insufficient to have produced or sustained any considerable revolution in our language the great work was reserved for Gower and Chaucer Wickliffe had also translated the bible  It is observable that he made his translation from the vulgate Latin version of Jerom It was finished See MS Cod Bibl Coll Eman Cant  and in other respects his attempts to bring about a reformation in religion at this time proved beneficial to English literature The orthodox divines of this period generally wrote in Latin but Wickliffe that his arguments might be familiarised to common readers and the bulk of the people was obliged to compose in English his numerous theological treatises against the papal corruptions Edward the third while he perhaps intended only to banish a badge of conquest greatly contributed to establish  the national diaiect by abolishing the use of the Norman tongue in the public acts and judicial proceedings as we have before observed and by substituting the natural language of the country But Chaucer manifestly first taught his countrymen to write English and formed a style by naturalising words from the Provencial at that time the most polished dialect of any in Europe and the best adapted to the purposes of poetical expression  It is certain that Chaucer abounds in classical allusions but his poetry is not formed on the antient models He appears to have been an universal reader and his learning is sometimes mistaken for genius but his chief sources were the French and Italian poets From these originals two of his capital poems the KNIGHT'S TALE  Chaucer alludes to some book from whence this tale was taken more than once viz v  "Whilom as  olde stories  tellin us"  v  "  As  olde bookes  to us saine that  all this storie telleth more plain"  v  "Of soulis fynd I nought in this  registre  "  That is this History or narrative See also v In the  Legende of good women  where Chau  r's works are mentioned is this passage which I do not well understand v  And al the love of Palamon and Arcite  Of Thebis  though the storie is known lite  and the ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE are imitations or translations The first of these is taken from Boccacio  Boccacio was the disciple of Petrarch and although principally known and deservedly celebrated as a writer or inventor of tales he was by his cotemporaries usually placed in the third rank after Dante and Petrarch But Boccacio having seen the Platonic sonnets of his master Petrarch in a fit of despair committed all his poetry to the flames  Goujet Bibl Fr Tom vii p But we must except that besides the poem mentioned below Boccacio's AMAZONIDA E FORZE D'ERCOLE are both now extant and were printed at Ferrara in or about the year fol  except a single poem of which his own good taste had long taught him to entertain a more favourable opinion This piece thus happily rescued from destruction is at present so scarce and so little known even in Italy as to have left  its author but a slender proportion of that eminent degree of poetical reputation which he might have justly claimed from so extraordinary a performance It is an heroic poem in twelve books entitled LE TESEIDE and written in the octave stanza called by the Italians  ottava rima  which Boccacio adopted from the old French chansons and here first introduced among his countrymen  See Crescimben I  tor Volgar Poes vol i L i p Ven  to    It was printed at Ferrara but with some deviations from the original and even misrepresentations of the story in the year  Poema della TESEIDE del Boccacio chiosato e dichia  ato du Andrea de Bassi in Ferrara fol  Afterwards I think in And for the third and last time at Venice in the year    to    But the corruptions have been suffered to remain through every edition  Whether Boccacio was the inventor of the story of this poem is a curious enquiry It is certain that Theseus was an early hero of romance  In Lydgate's TEMPLE OF GLAS never printed among the lovers painted on the wall is The  eus killing the Mino  aure I suppose from Ovid Bibl Bodl MSS Fair  ax Or from Chaucer  Legende Ar  adne  He was taken from that grand repository of the Grecian heroes the History of Troy

in question or whether this is the same Theseus I cannot ascertain There is likewise in the same royal library a manuscript called by Montfaucon HISTORIA THESEI IN LINGUA VULGARI in ten books  Bibl MSS ut supr p  The Abbe Goujet observes that there is in some libraries of France an old French translation of Boccacio's THESEID from which Anna de Graville formed the French poem of PALAMON and ARCITE at the command of queen Claude wife of Francis the first about the year  Ut supr p  Either the translation used by Anna de Graville or her poem is perhaps the second of the manuscripts

also been translated into French prose by D C C  mo  Paris  "La THESEIDE de Jean Boccace contenant les chastes amours de deux chevaliers Thebans Arcite et Polemon c"  Jane de la Fontaine also translated into French verse this poem She died Her translation was never printed It is applauded by Joannes Secundus Eleg xv  Boccacio himself mentions the story of Palamon and Arcite This may seem to imply that the story existed before his time unless he artfully intended to recommend his own poem on the subject by such an allusion It is where he introduces two lovers singing a portion of this tale  "Dioneo e Fiametta gran pezza canterona insieme d'ARCITE e di PALAMONE  Giorn vii Nov pag edit Vineg  to  Chaucer himself alludes to this story B  Kn v Perhaps on the same principle  "  By Dioneo Boccacio represents himself and by Fiametta his mistress Mary of Arragon a natural daughter of Robert king of Naples  I confess I am of opinion that Boccacio's THESEID is an original composition But there is a Grecobarbarous poem extant on this subject which if it could be proved to be antecedent in point of time to the Italian poem would degrade Boccacio to a mere translator on this occasion It is a matter that deserves to be examined at large and to be traced with accuracy  This Greek poem is as little known and as scarce as Boccacio's THESEID It is entitled  It was printed in quarto at Venice in the year  Stampata in Vinegia per Giovanantonio et fratelli da Sabbio a requisitione de M Damiano de Santa Maria de Spici  M D XXIX  del Mese de Decembrio  A manuscript of it is

THESEI ET AEMILIAE The heads of the chapters are adorned with rude wooden cuts of the story I once suspected that Boccacio having received this poem from some of his learned friends among the Grecian exiles who being driven from Constantinople took refuge in Italy about the fourteenth century translated it into Italian Under this supposition I was indeed surprised to find the ideas of chivalry and the ceremonies of a tournament minutely described in a poem which appeared to have been written at Constantinople But this difficulty was soon removed when I recollected that the Franks Venetians and Germans had been in possession of that city for more than one hundred years and that Baldwin earl of Flanders was elected emperor of Constantinople in the year and was succeeded by four Latin or Frankish emperors down to the year  About which period it is probable that the anonymous Greek poem called the  Loves of Lybister and Rhodamna  was written This appears by the German name Frederic which often occurs in it and is grecised with many other German words In a manuscript of this poem which Crusius saw were many paintings and illuminations where in the representation of a battle he observed no guns but javelins and bows and arrows He adds  "et musicae testudines"  It is written in the iambic measure mentioned below It is a series of wandering adventures with little art or invention Lybister the son of a Latin king and a Christian sets forward accompanied with an hundred attendants in search of Rhodamna whom he had lost by the stratagems of a certain old woman skilled in magic He meets Clitophon son of a king of Armenia They undergo various dangers in different countries Lybister relates his dream concerning a partridge and an eagle and how from that dream he fell in love with Rhodamna daughter of Chyses a pagan king and communicated his passion by sending an arrow to which his name was affixed into a tower or castle called Argyrocastre c See Crusii

laid in Rhodes Cyprus Crete and other parts of Greece belonging  to the imperial territory  Giorn v Nov  But to say no more of this I have at present no sort of doubt of what I before asserted that Boccacio is the writer and inventor of this piece Our Greek poem is in fact a literal translation from the Italian THESEID It consists of twelve books and is written in Boccacio's octave stanza the two last lines of every stanza rhyming together The verses are of the iambic kind and something like the VERSUS POLITICI which were common among the Greek scholars a little before and long after Constantinople was taken by the Turks in the year It will readily be allowed that the circumstance of the stanzas and rhymes is very singular in a poem composed in the Greek language and is alone sufficient to prove this piece to be a translation from Boccacio I must not forget to observe that the Greek is extremely barbarous and of the lowest period of that language  It was a common practice of the learned and indigent Greeks who frequented Italy and the neighbouring states about the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to translate the popular pieces of Italian poetry and the romances or tales most in vogue into these Grecobarbarous iambics  That is  versus politici  abovementioned a sort of loose iambic See Langii PHILOLOGIA GRAECOBARBARA Tzetes's Chiliads are written in this

only to a very few curious scholars    L vii Sign μ g    In passing through Chaucer's hands this poem has received many new beauties Not only those capital fictions and desc  iptions the temples of Mars Venus and Diana with their allegorical paintings and the figures of Lycurgus and Emetrius with their retinue are so much heightened by the bold and spiri  ed manner of the British bard as to strike us with an air of originality In the mean time it is to be remarked that as Chaucer in some places has thrown in strokes of his own so in others he has contracted the uninteresting and tedious prolixity of narrative which he found in the Italian poet And that he might avoid a servile imitation and indulge himself as he pleased in an arbitrary departure from the original it appears that he neglected the embarrassment of Boccacio's stanza and preferred the English heroic couplet of which this poem affords the first conspicuous example extant in our language  The situation and structure of the temple of Mars are thus described  A forrest  In which there wonneth nether man ne best  With knotty knarry barrein treys old  Of stubbys shape and hideous to behold  In which ther was a rombyll and a swough  Sound  As though a storm shulde burstein every bough  And downward from a hill under a bent  Precipice    There stode the temple' of Mars armipotent  Wrought all of burnyd  Burnished  stele of which th' entr  Was long and streight and gastly for to se  And therout came such a rage and avyse  Noise  That it made al the gatys for to ryse  "It strained the doors Almost forced them from their hinges"    The northern light in at the doris shone  For window on the wall ne was ther none  Throgh which men mightin any light dissern  The dore was al of adamant eterne  Yclenchid overthwart and endelong  With iron tough for to makin it strong  Every pillar the tempyl to sustene  Was tonnè grete  A  great tun  A tunweight  of yren bright and shene  The gloomy sanctuary of this tremendous fane was adorned with these characteristical imageries  There saw I first the dark Ymagining  Of Felony and all the compassing  The cruell Irè redde as any glede  Coal    The Pikpurse also and eke the pale Drede  Fear    The Smyter with the knife undir the cloke  Dryden has converted this image into clerical hypocrisy under which he takes an opportunity of gratifying his spleen against the clergy  Knight's Tale B ii p edit  Next stood Hypocrisy with  holy  leer  Softsmiling and demurely looking down  But hid the dagger underneath the  gown    The shepin brenning

Strife  with bloodie knyves  This image is likewise entirely misrepresented by Dryden and turned to a satire on the church  Contest with sharpen'd knives in  cloysters  drawn  And all with blood

supposed to kill himself by driving a nail into his head in the night and to be found dead and cold in his bed with his  "mouth gapyng upryght"  This is properly the meaning of his  "hair being bathed in blood"  Shode  in the text is literally  a bush of hair  Dryden has finely paraphrased this passage    Amiddis of the temple sate Mischaunce  With discomfort and sory countenance  Yet sawe I

imagination unacquainted with selection and arrangement of images It is rudely thrown on the canvas without order or art In the Italian poets who describe every thing and who cannot even in the most serious representations easily suppress their natural predilection for burlesque and familiar imagery nothing is more common than this mixture of sublime and comic ideas  There are many other instances of this mixture v  "We strive as did the houndis for the bone"  v  "We fare as he that dronk is as a mouse c"  v  "Farewel physick Go bere the corse to church"  v  "Some said he lokid grim and he wolde  ight c"  The form of Mars follows touched with the impetuous dashes of a savage and spirited pencil  The statue  Form or figure Statuary is not implied here Thus he mentions the  statue  of Mars on a banner supr v I cannot forbear adding in this place these fine verses of Mars arming himself in haste from our author's  Complaint of Mars and Venus  v  He throwith on his helme of hugè weight  And girt him with his sworde and in his hond  His mighty spere as he was wont to feight  He shekith so that it al  ost to wende  Here we see the force of description without a profusion of idle epithets These verses are all sinew they have nothing but verbs and substantives  of Mars upon a cart  Chariot  stode  Armid and lokid grym as he were wode  Mad    A wolfe ther stod before him at

Thebaid of Statius I will make no apology for transcribing the passage at large that the reader may judge of the resemblance Mercury visits the temple of Mars situated in the frozen and tempestuous regions of Thrace  Chaucer points out this very temple in the introductory lines v  Like to the estries of the grisly place  That hight the  grete temple of Mars in Thrace  In thilke cold and frosty

think Statius is copied in a simile v The introduction of this poem is also taken from the Thebaid xii Compare Chaucer's lines v seq v seq v seq The funeral pyre of Arcite is also translated from Theb vi seq See Ch v seq I likewise take this opportunity of observing that Lucretius and Plato are imitated in this poem Together with many passages from Ovid and Virgil    Statius was a favourite writer with the poets of the middle ages His bloated magnificence of description gigantic images and pompous diction suited their taste and were somewhat of a piece with the romances they so much admired They neglected the gentler and genuine graces of Virgil which they could not relish His pictures were too correctly and chastly drawn to take their fancies and truth of design elegance of expression and the arts of composition  were not their objects  In Troilus and Cresside  he has translated the arguments of the twelve books of the Thebaid of Statius See B v p seq  In the mean time we must observe that in Chaucer's Temple of Mars many personages are added and that those which existed before in Statius have been retouched enlarged and rendered more distinct and picturesque by Boccacio and Chaucer Arcite's address to Mars at entering the temple has great dignity and is not copied from Statius  O strongè god that in the reignis cold  Of Thrace honourid art and God yhold  And hast in

scenes  con amore  and his imagination seems to have been peculiarly struck with the charms of a rural prospect at sunrising  We are surprised to find in a poet of such antiquity numbers so nervous and flowing a circumstance which greatly contributed to render Dryden's paraphrase of this poem the most animated and harmonious piece of versification in the English language I cannot leave the KNIGHT'S TALE without remarking that the inventor of this poem appears to have possessed considerable talents for the artificial construction of a story It exhibits unexpected and striking turns of fortune and abounds in those incidents which are calculated to strike the fancy by opening resources to sublime description or interest the heart by pathetic situations On this account even without considering the poetical and exterior ornaments of the piece we are hardly disgusted with the mixture of manners the confusion of times and the like violations of propriety which this poem in common with all others of its age presents in almost every page The action is supposed to have happened soon after the marriage of Theseus with Hippolita and the death of Creon in the siege of Thebes but we are soon transported into more recent periods Sunday the celebration of matins judicial astrology heraldry tilts and tournaments knights of England and targets of Prussia  The knights of the Teutonic

 CHAUCER'S ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE is translated from a French poem entitled LE ROMAN DE LA ROSE It was begun by William of Lorris a student in jurisprudence who died about the year  Fauchet p  Being left unfinished it was completed by John of Meun a native of a little town of that name situated on the river Loire near Orleans who seems to have flourished about the year  Id ibid p He also translated Boethius  De Consolatione  and  Abelard's Letters  and wrote  Answers of the Sybills  c  This poem is esteemed by the French the most valuable piece of their old poetry It is far beyond the rude efforts of all their preceding romancers and they have nothing equal to it before the reign of Francis the first who died in the year But there is a considerable difference in the merit of the two authors William of Lorris who wrote not one quarter of the poem is remarkable for his elegance and luxuriance of description and is a beautiful painter of allegorical personages John of Meun is a writer of another cast He possesses but little of his predecessor's inventive and poetical vein and in that respect was not properly qualified to finish a poem begun by William of Lorris But he has strong satire and great liveliness  The poem consists of verses William of Lorris's part ends with v viz  "A peu que je ne m'en desespoir"  He was one of the wits of the court of Charles le Bel  The difficulties and dangers of a lover in pursuing and obtaining the object of his desires are the literal argument of this poem This design is couched under the allegory of  a Rose which our lover after frequent obstacles gathers in a delicious garden He traverses vast ditches scales lofty walls and forces the gates of adamantine and almost impregnable castles These enchanted fortresses are all inhabited by various divinities some of which assist and some oppose the lover's progress  In the preface of the edition printed in the year all this allegory is turned to religion The Rose is proved to be a state of grace or divine wisdom or eternal beatitude or the Holy Virgin to which heretics cannot gain access It is the white Rose of Jericho  Quasi plantatio Ros  in Jericho  c c The chemists in the mean time made it a search for the Philosopher's Stone and other professions with laboured commentaries explained it into their own respective sciences    Chaucer has luckily translated all that was written by William of Lorris  See Occleve's  Letter of Cupide  written Urry's  Chaucer  p v Who calls John of Moon the author of the  Romaunt of the Rose  he gives only part of the continuation of John of Meun  Chaucer's poem consists of verses and ends with this verse of the original viz v  "Vous aurez absolution"  But Chaucer has made several omissions in John of Meun's part before he comes to this period He has translated all William of Lorris's part as I have observed and his translation of that part ends with v viz  "Than shuldin I fallin in wanhope"  Chaucer's cotemporaries called his  Romant of the Rose  a translation Lydgate says that Chaucer  Notably did his businesse  By grete avyse his wittes to dispose  To  translate  the ROMANS OF THE ROSE  Prol Boch st vi It is manifest that Chaucer took no pains to disguise his translation He literally follows the French in saying that a river was  "lesse than  Saine  "  i e the Seine at Paris v  "No wight in all Paris"  v A grove has more birds  "than ben in all the relme of  Fraunce  v He calls a pine  "A tree in  France  men call a pine"  v He says of roses  "so faire werin nevir in  Rone  "  v  "That for Paris ne for Pavie"  v He has sometimes reference to French ideas or words not in the original As  "Men clepin hem Sereins in France"  v  "From Jerusalem to Burgoine"  v  "Grein de Paris"  v Where Skinner says  Paris  is contracted for  Paradise  In mentioning minstrells and juglers he says that some of them  "Songin songes of Loraine"  v He adds  For in Loraine there notis be  Full swetir than  in this contre  There is not a syllable of these songs and singers of Loraine in the French By the way I suspect that Chaucer translated this poem while he was at Paris There are also many allusions to English affairs which I suspected to be Chaucer's but they are all in the French original Such as  "Hornpipis of Cornevaile"  v These are called in the original  "Chalemeaux de Cornouaille"  v A knight is introduced allied to king  "Arthour of Bretaigne"  v Who is called  "Bon roy Artus de Bretaigne"  Orig v Sir Gawin and Sir Kay two of Arthur's knights are characterised v seq See Orig v Where the word  Keulx  is corrupt for Keie But there is one passage in which he mentions a  Bachelere  as fair as  "The Lordis sonne of Windisore"  v This is added by Chaucer and intended as a compliment to some of his patrons In the  Legende of good Women  Cupid says to Chaucer v  For in plain text withoutin nede of glose  Thou hast  translatid  the  Romaunt of the Rose  How far he has improved on the French  original the reader shall judge I will exhibit passages selected from both poems respectively placing the French under the English for the convenience of comparison The

the rose of beauty  With that anon out start DANGERE  A tant saillit villain DANGERE  De là on il estoit mueè  Grant fut noir et tout hericè  S'ot les yeulx rouges comme feux  Le vis froncè le nez

Contracted  full kirkid  Cr  ok    Turned upwards  stoode  He come criande  "Crying as if he was mad"  as he were woode  v    Chaucer has enriched this figure The circumstance of DANGER'S hair standing erect like the prickles on the urchin or hedgehog is his own and finely imagined  Hitherto specimens have been given from that part of this poem which was written by William de Lorris its first inventor Here Chaucer was in his own walk One of the most striking pictures in the style of allegorical personification which occurs in Chaucer's translation of the additional part is much heightened by Chaucer and indeed owes all its merit to the translator whose g  nius was much better adapted to this species of painting than that of John of Meun the continuator of the poem  With her Labour and eke Travaile  Travaile et douleur la hebergent  Mais ill le lient et la chargent  Que mort prochaine luy presentent  Et talent de seq repentir  Tant luy sont de fleaux sentir  Adonc luy

like sort were counsellors in the palace of OLD AGE and employed in telling her day and night that  "DEATH stood  armed  at her gate"  was far beyond the sentimental and satirical vein of John of Meun and is conceived with great vigour of imagination  Chaucer appears to have been early struck with this French poem In his DREME written long before he begun this translation he supposes that the chamber in which he slept was richly painted with the story of the ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE  v Chaucer alludes to this poem in The MARCHAUNT'S TALE v p Urr  It is natural to imagine that such a poem must have been a favorite with Chaucer No poet before William of Lorris either Italian or French had delineated allegorical personages in so distinct and enlarged a style and with such a fullness of characteristical attributes nor had descriptive poetry selected such a variety of circumstances and disclosed such an exuberance of embellishment in forming agreeable representations of nature On this account we are surprised that Boileau should mention Villon as the first poet of France who drew form and order from the chaos of the old French romancers  Villon sçeut le PREMIER dans ces siecles grossiers  Debroüiller l'ART CONFUS de nos vieux ROMANCIERS  Art Poet ch i He died about the year    But the poetry of William of Lorris was not the poetry of Boileau  That this poem should not please Boileau I can easily conceive It is more surprising that it should have been censured as a contemptible performance by Petrarch who lived in the age of fancy Petrarch being desired by his friend Guy de Gonzague to send him some new piece sent the ROMAN DE LA ROSE With the poem instead of an encomium he returned a severe criticism in which he treats it as a cold inartificial and extravagant composition as a proof how much France who valued this poem as her chief work was surpassed by Italy in eloquence and the arts of writing  See Petrarch Carm L i Ep  In this opinion we must attribute something to jealousy But the truth is Petrarch's genius was too cultivated to relish these wild excursions of imagination his favorite classics whom he revived and studied with so much attention ran in his head Especially Ovid's ART OF LOVE a poem of another species and evidently formed on another plan but which Petrarch had been taught to venerate as the model and criterion of a didactic poem on the passion of love reduced to a system We may add that although the poem before us was founded on the visionary doctrines and refinements concerning love invented by the Provencial poets and consequently less unlikely to be favourably received by Petrarch yet his ideas on that delicate subject were much more Platonic and metaphysical  SECT XIV  CHAUCER'S poem of TROILUS and CRESSEIDE is said to be formed on an old history written by Lollius a native of Urbino in Italy  Petrus Lambeccius enumerates Lollius Urbicus among the  Historici Latini profani  of the third century Prodrom p Hamb See also Voss Historic Latin ii p edit Ludg Bat But this could not be Chaucer's Lollius Chaucer places Lollius among the historians of Troy in his House of Fame iii It is extraordinary that Du Fresne in the  Iudex Auct  rum  used by him for his Latin glossary should mention this Lollius Urbicus of the third century Tom i p edit i As I apprehend none of his works remain A proof that Chaucer translated from some Italian original is that in a manuscript which I have seen of this poem I find  M  nesteo  for  Menestes Rupheo  for  Ruphes Phebuseo  for  Phebuses  lib iv seq Where by the way Xantippe a Trojan chief was perhaps corruptly written for Xantippo i e Xantippus As Joseph Iscan iv In Lydgate's Troy  Zantiphus  iii All corrupted from Antiphus Dict Cret p In the printed copies we have  Ascalapho  for Ascalaphus lib v  Lydgate says that Chaucer in this poem  made a translacion  Of a boke which called is TROPHE  In Lumbarde tongue c  Prol Boch st iii    It is certain that Chaucer in this piece frequently refers to  "MYNE AUCTOR LOLLIUS  See lib i v  "  But he hints at the same time that Lollius wrote in Latin  Lib ii v  I have never seen this history either in the Lombard or the Latin language I have before observed that it is mentioned in Boccacio's Decameron and that a translation of it was made into Greek verse by some of the Greek fugitives in the fourteenth century Du Fresne if I mistake not somewhere mentions it in Italian In the royal library at Paris it occurs often as an antient French romance  "Cod Roman de Troilus" "Cod Roman de Troilus et de Briseida ou Criseida"  Again as an original  work of Boccacio  "Cod Philostrato dell' amorose fatiche de Troilo per GIOVANNI BOCCACIO"  "Les suivans adds Montfaucon  Bibl p col Compare Lengl Bibl Rom ii p  contiennent  les autres oeuvres  de Boccace"  Much fabulous history concerning Troilus is related in Guido de Columna's Destruction of Troy Whatever were Chaucer's materials he has on this subject constructed a poem of considerable merit in which the vicissitudes of love are depicted in a strain of true poetry with much pathos and simplicity of sentiment  Chaucer however claims no merit of invention in this poem He invokes Clio to favour him with rhymes only and adds  To everie lover I me' excuse  That of no  sentiment  I this endite  But  out of latin in my tonge it write  L ii v seq But Sir Francis Kinaston who translated TROILUS AND CRESSEIDE into Latin rhymes says that Chaucer in this poem  "has taken the liberty of his own inventions"  In the mean time Chaucer by his own references seems to have been studious of seldom departing from Lollius In one place he pays him a compliment as an author whose excellencies he could not reach L iii v  Bot sothe is though I can not tellen all  As can mine author  of his excellence  See also L iii  He calls it  "a litill tragedie  L ult v  "  Troilus is supposed to have seen Cresside in a temple and retiring to his chamber is thus naturally described in the critical situation of a lover examining his own mind after the first impression of love  And whan that he in chambre was alone  He down upon his beddis fete him sette  And first he gan to sihe  Sigh  and then to grone  And thought aie on her so withoutin lette  That as he satte and woke his spirit mette  Thought Imagined  That he her saugh and temple and all the wise  Manner  Right of her loke and gan it newe avise  L i v    There is not so much nature in the sonnet to Love which follows It is translated from Petrarch and had Chaucer followed his own genius he would not have disgusted us  with the affected gallantry and exaggerated compliments which it extends through five tedious stanzas The doubts and delicacies of a young girl disclosing her heart to her lover are exquisitely touched in this comparison  And as the n  we abashid nightingale  That stintith  Stops  first when she beginith sing  When that she herith any herdis  Herdsman  A Shepherd  tale  Or in the hedgis anie wight stirring  And after sikir  With confidence  doth her voice outring  Right so Cresseidè when that her drede stent  Her fears ceased  Op  ned her herte and told him her intent  L iii v    The following pathetic scene may be selected from many others Troilus seeing Cresside in a swoon imagines her to be dead H  unsheaths his sword with an intent to kill himself and utters these exclamations  And thou cite in which I live in wo  And thou Priam and brethren al ifere  Together    And thou my mother farwel for I go  And Atropos make ready thou my bere  And thou Creseidè O sweet hertè dere  Receive thou now my spirit would he say  With swerd at hert all redy for to dey  But as god would of swough  Swoon  she tho abraide  Then awaked    And gan to sighe and TROILUS she cride  And he answerid Lady mine Creseide  Livin ye yet And let his sword doune glide  Yes hertè mine that thankid be Cupide  Quoth she and therwithall she sorè sight  Sighed  And he began to glad her as he might  Toke her in armis two and kist her oft  And her to glad he did all his entent  For which her ghost that flickered aie alo  Into her woefull breast aien it went  But at the last as that her eyin glent  Glanced  Aside anon she gan his swerde aspie  As it lay bere and gan for fere to crie  And askid him why he had it outdrawe  And Troilus anon the cause hir tolde  And how therwith himself he would have slawe  For which Creseide upon him gan behold  And gan him in her armis fast to fold  And said O mercy God to whiche a dede  Alas how nere we werin bothè dede  L iv v    Pathetic description is one of Chaucer's peculiar excellencies  In this poem are various imitations from Ovid which are of too particular and minute a nature to be pointed out here and belong to the province of a professed and formal commentator on the piece The Platonic notion in the third book  v  about universal love and the doctrine that this principle acts with equal and uniform influence both in the natural and moral world are a translation from Boethius  Consolat Philosoph L ii Met ult iii Met Spenser is full of the same doctrine See Fairy Queen i ix iv x c c I could point out many other imitations from Boethius in this poem  And in the KNIGHT'S TALE he mentions from the same favorite system of philosophy the FAIRE CHAINE OF LOVE  v Urr  It is worth observing that the reader is referred to Dar  s  Phrygius instead of Homer for a display of the atchievements of Troilus  His worthi dedis who so list him here  Rede DARES he can tel hem all ifere  L iv v    Our author from his excessive fondness for Statius has been guilty of a very diverting and what may be called a double anachronism He represents Cresside with two of her female companions sitting in a  pavid parlour  and reading the THEBAID of Statius  L ii v  which is called  the Geste of the Siege of Thebes  L ii v  and  the Romance of Thebis  L ii v  Bishop Amphiorax  is mentioned ib v Pandarus says v  All this I know my selve  And all the assiege of Thebes and all the care  For herof ben ther makid  bokis twelve  In his  Dreme  Chaucer to pass the night away rather than play at chess calls for a  Romaunce  in which  "were writtin fables of quenis livis and of kings and many othir thingis smale"  This proves to be Ovid v seq See Man of L T v Urr There was an old French Romance called PARTONEPEX often cited by Du Cange and Carpentier Gl Lat This is Parthenopeus a hero of the Theban story It was translated into English and called PERTONAPE See p supr  In another place Cassandra translates the Arguments of the twelve books of the THEBAID  L v v I will add here that Cresside proposes the trial of the Ordeal to Troilus L iii v Troilus during the times of truce amuses himself with hawking L iii v  In the fourth book of this poem Pandarus endeavours to comfort Troilus with arguments concerning the doctrine of predestination taken from Brawardine a learned archbishop and theologist and nearly Chaucer's cotemporary  In his book DE CAUSA DEI published by Sir Henry Savile He touches on this controversy Nonne's Pr T v Urr See also Tr Cr L iv v seq    This poem although almost as long as the Eneid was intended to be sung to the harp as well as read  And redde where so thou be or ellis  songe  L ult v    It is dedicated to the  morall  Gower and to the  philosophical  Strode Gower will occur as a poet hereafter Strode was  eminent for his scholastic knowledge and tutor to Chaucer's son Lewis at Merton college in Oxford  Whether the HOUSE OF FAME is Chaucer's invention or suggested by any French or Italian poet I cannot determine But I am apt to think it was originally a Provencial composition among other proofs from this passage  And ther came out so gret a noise  That had it standin upon OYSE  Men might have herd it esily  I trow to ROME sikerly  L ii v    The Oyse is a river in Picardy which falls into the river Seine not many leagues from Paris An Englishman would not have expressed distance by such an unfamiliar illustration Unless we reconcile the matter by supposing that Chaucer wrote this poem during his travels There is another passage where the ideas are those of a foreign romance To the trumpeters of renown the poet adds  All that usid clarion  In Casteloigne or Arragon  B iii v    Casteloigne is Catalonia in Spain  See MARCHAUNT'S TALE v p Urr He mentions a rock higher than any in Spain B ii v But this I believe was an English proverb  The martial musicians of English tournaments so celebrated in story were a more natural and obvious allusion for an English poet  He mentions a plate of gold  "As fine as  duckett  in  Venise  "  B iii v But he says that the Galaxy is called  Watlyngstrete  B ii v He swears by Thomas a Beckett B iii v In one place he is addressed by the name of GEOFFREY B ii v But in two others by that of PETER B i v B iii v Among the musicians he mentions  "Pipirs of all the Duche tong"  B iii v    This poem contains great strokes of Gothic imagination yet  bordering often on the most ideal and capricious extravagance The poet in a vision sees a temple of glass  In which were more images  Of gold stondinge in sundrie

this temple were engraved stories from Virgil's Eneid  Where he mentions Virgil's hell he likewise refers to Claudian  De Raptu Proserpinae  and Dante's  Inferno  v There is a translation of a few lines from Dante whom he calls  "the wise poet of Florence"  in the WIFE OF BATH'S TALE v p Urr The story of Hugolin of Pisa a subject which Sir Joshua Reynolds has lately painted in a capital style

Nonesuch all Ovid's Metamorphoses were cut in stone under the windows Hearne Coll MSS p But the Epistles seem to have been the favorite work the subject of which coincided with the gallantry of the times  Leaving this temple he sees an eagle with golden wings soaring near the sun  Faste by the sonne on hie  As kennyng myght I with mine eie  Methought I sawe an egle sore  But that it semid mochil more  Greater    Then I had any egle sene  The eagle says to the poet that this house stands  "Right so as  thine ane boke  tellith"  B ii v  That is Ovid's Metamorphoses See Met L xii v c    It was af gold and shone so bright  That nevir man sawe suche a sight  B i v seq  c  The eagle descends seizes the poet in his talons and mounting again conveys him to the House of Fame which is  situated like that of Ovid between earth and sea In their passage thither they fly above the stars which our author leaves with clouds tempests hail and snow far beneath him This aerial journey is partly copied from Ovid's Phaeton in the chariot of the sun But the poet apologises for this extravagant fiction and explains his meaning by alledging the authority of Boethius who says that Contemplation may soar on the wings of Philosophy above every element He likewise recollects in the midst of his course the description of the heavens given by Marcianus Capella in his book  De Nuptiis Philologiae

the armorial ensigns of the most redoubted champions that ever tourneyed in Africa Europe or Asia The floor and roof of the hall were covered with thick plates of gold studded with the costliest gems At the upper end on a lofty shrine made of carbuncle sate Fame Her figure is like those in Virgil and Ovid Above her as if sustained on her shoulders sate Alexander and Hercules From the throne to the gates of the hall ran a range of pillars with respective inscriptions On the first pillar made of lead and iron  In the composition of these pillars Chaucer displays his chemical knowledge  stood Josephus the Jewish historian  "That of the Jewis gestis told"  with seven other writers on the same subject On the second pillar made of iron and painted all over with the blood of tigers stood Statius On another higher than the rest stood Homer Dares Phrygius Livy  Dares Phrygius and Livy are both cited in Chaucer's DREME v Chaucer is fond of quoting Livy He was also much admired by Petrarch who while at Paris assisted in translating him into French This circumstance might make Livy a favorite with Chaucer See Vie de Petrarque iii p  Lollius Guido of Columna and Geoffry of Monmouth writers of the Trojan story On a pillar of  "tinnid iron clere"  stood Virgil and next him on a pillar of copper appeared Ovid  The figure of Lucan was placed on a pillar of iron  wroght full

alludes to this poem of Claudian in the MARCHAUNT'S TALE where he calls Pluto the king of  "fayrie"  v p Urr    The hall was filled with the writers of antient tales and romances whose subjects and names were too numerous to be recounted In the mean time crouds from every nation and of every condition filled the hall and each presented his claim to the queen A messenger is dispatched to summon Eolus from his cave in Thrace who is ordered to bring his two clarions called SLANDER and PRAISE and his trumpeter Triton The praises of each petitioner are then resounded according to the partial or capricious appointment of Fame and equal merits obtain very different success There is much satire and humour in these requests and rewards and in the disgraces and honours which are indiscriminately distributed by the queen without discernment and by chance The poet then enters the house or labyrinth of RUMOUR It was built of  allow twigs like a cage and therefore admitted every sound Its doors were also more numerous than leaves on the trees and always stood open These are romantic exaggerations of Ovid's inventions on the same subject It was moreover sixty miles in length and perpetually turning round From this house says the poet issued tidings of every kind like fountains and rivers from the sea Its inhabitants who were eternally employed in hearing or telling news together with the rise of reports and the formation  of lies are then humourously described the company is chiefly composed of sailors pilgrims and pardoners At length our author is awakened at seeing a venerable personage of great authority and thus the Vision abruptly concludes  Pope has imitated this piece with his usual elegance of diction and harmony of versification But in the mean time he has not only misrepresented the story but marred the character of the poem He has endeavoured to correct it's extravagancies by new refinements and additions of another cast but he did not consider that extravagancies are essential to a poem of such a structure and even constitute it's beauties An attempt to unite order and exactness of imagery with a subject formed on principles so professedly romantic and anomalous is like giving Corinthian pillars to a Gothic palace When I read Pope's elegant imitation of this piece I think I am walking among the modern monuments unsuitably placed in Westminsterabbey  SECT XV  NOTHING can be more ingeniously contrived than the occasion on which Chaucer's CANTERBURY TALES are supposed to be recited A company of pilgrims on their journey to visit the shrine of Thomas a Beckett at Canterbury lodge at the Tabardeinn in Southwark Although strangers to each other they are assembled in one room at supper as was then the custom and agree not only to travel together the next morning but to relieve the fatigue of the journey by telling each a story  There is an inn at Burford in Oxfordshire which accommodated pilgrims on their road to Saint Edward's shrine in the abbey of Gloucester A long room with a series of Gothic windows still remains which was their refectory Leland mentions such another Itin ii  Chaucer undoubtedly intended to imitate Boccacio whose DECAMERON was then the most popular of books in writing a set of tales But the circumstance invented by Boccacio as the cause which gave rise to his DECAMERON or the relation of his hundred stories  It is remarkable that Boccacio chose a Greek title that is  for his Tales He has also given Gre  k names to the ladies and gentlemen who recite the tales His Eclogues are full of Greek words This was natural at the revival of the Greek language  is by no means so happily conceived as that of Chaucer for a similar purpose Boccacio supposes that when the plague began to abate at Florence ten young persons of both sexes retired to a country house two miles from the city with a design of enjoying fresh air and passing ten days agreeably Their principal and established amusement instead of playing at chess after dinner was for each to tell a tale One superiority which among others Chaucer's plan afforded above that of Boccacio was  the opportunity of displaying a variety of striking and dramatic characters which would not have easily met but on such an expedition A circumstance which also contributed to give a variety to the stories And for a number of persons in their situation so natural so practicable so pleasant I add so rational a mode of entertainment could not have been imagined  The CANTERBURY TALES are unequal and of various merit Few if any of the stories are perhaps the invention of Cha  cer I have already spoken at large of the KNIGHT'S TALE one of our author's noblest compositions  The reader will excuse my irregularity in not considering it under the CANTERBURY TALES I have here given the reason which is my apology in the text  That of the CANTERBURY TALES which deserves the next place as written in the higher strain of poetry and the poem by which Milton describes and characterises Chaucer is the SQUIER'S TALE The imagination of this story consists in Arabian fiction engrafted on Gothic chivalry Nor is this Arabian fiction purely the sport of arbitrary fancy it is in great measure founded on Arabian learning Cambuscan a king of Tartary celebrates his birthday festival in the hall of his palace at Sarra with the most royal magnificence In the midst of the solemnity the guests are alarmed with a miraculous and unexpected spectacle the minstrells cease on a sudden and all the assembly is hushed in silence surprise and suspence  While that the king sate thus in his noblay  H  rkining his minstrelis ther thingis play  Beforn him at his bord deliciously  In at the hallè dore ful sodeinly  There came a knight upon a stede of brass  And in his honde a brode mirroùr of glass  Upon his thombe he had of gold a ring  And by his side a nakid sword hanging  And up he rideth to the hiè bord  In all the hall ne was there spoke a word  For marveile of this knight him to behold  v S  e a fine romantic story of a Count de Macon who while revelling in his hall with many knights is suddenly alarmed by the entrance of a gigantic figure of a black man mounted on a black steed This terrible stranger without receiving any obstruction from guards or gates rides directly forward to the high table and with an imperious tone orders the count to follow him c Nic Gillos chron ann See also O  S FAIR QU § v p    These presents were sent by the king of Araby and Inde to Cambuscan in honour of his feast The Horse of brass

in the air with the swiftness of an eagle and again as occasion required he could stand motionless in opposition to the strongest force vanish on a sudden at command and return at his master's call The Mirrour of glass was endued with the power of shewing any future disasters which might happen to Cambuscan's kingdom and discovered the most hidden machinations of treason The Naked Sword could pierce armour deemed impenetrable  "Were it as thik as is a branchid ok  "  And he who was wounded with it could never be healed unless its possessor could be entreated to stroke the wound with its edge The Ring was intended for Canace Cambuscan's daughter and while she bore it in her purse or wore it on her thumb  nabled her to understand the language of every species of birds and the virtues of every plant  And whan this knight hath first his tale ytold  He ridd out of the hall and down he light  His Stede which that shone as the sunnè bright  Stant in the court as still as any stone  The

Arabians  Diss i ii  In this poem the nature of those studies is displayed and their operations exemplified and this consideration added to the circumstances of Tartary being the scene of action and Arabia the country from which these extraordinary presents are brought induces me to believe this story to be one of the many fables which the Arabians imported into Europe At least it is formed on their principles Their sciences were tinctured with the warmth of their imaginations and consisted in wonderful discoveries and mysterious inventions  This idea of a horse of brass took it's rise from their chemical knowledge and experiments in metals The treatise of Jeber a famous Arab chemist of the middle ages called LAPIS PHILOSOPHORUM contains many curious and useful processes concerning the nature of metals their fusion purification and malleability which still maintain a place in modern systems of that science  The Arabians call chemistry as treating of minerals and metals SIMIA From

the crown of the head of this wonderful bird there was a mirrour or plate of glass in which the Mexicans saw their future invaders the Spaniards and all the disasters which afterwards happened to their kingdom These superstitions remained even in the doctrines of philosophers long after the darker ages Cornelius Agrippa a learned physician of Cologne about the year author of a famous book on the Vanity of the Sciences mentions a species of mirrour which exhibited the form of persons absent at command  It is diverting in this book to observe the infancy of experimental philosophy and their want of knowing how to use or apply the mechanical arts which they were even actually possessed of Agrippa calls the inventor of magnifying glasses  "without doubte the beginner of all dishonestie"  He mentions various sorts of diminishing burning reflecting and multiplying glasses with some others At length this profound thinker closes the chapter with this sage reflection  "All these thinges are vaine and superfluous and invented to no other end but for pomp  and idle pleasure"  Chap xxvi p  A translation by James Sandford Lond to Bl Let  In one of these he is said to have shewn to the

immediately concerned The philosophers of their school invented a story of a magical steelglass placed by Ptolemy on the summit of a lofty pillar near the city of Alexandria for burning ships at a distance The Arabians called this pillar  He madeslaeor  or the pillar of the Arabians  The same fablers have adapted a similar fiction to Hercules that he erected pillars at Cape Finest  rre on which he raised magical lookingglasses In an eastern romance called the SEVEN WISE MASTERS of which more will be said hereafter at the siege of Hur in Persia certain philosophers terrified the enemy by a

was suggested by their skill in medicine by which they affected to communicate healing qualities to various substances  The notion mentioned before that every stone of Stonehenge was washed with juices of herbs in Africa and tinctured with healing powers is a piece of the same philosophy  and from their knowledge of tempering iron and hardening all kinds of metal  Montfaucon cites a Greek

Inn  m Where the palace and gardens of Dragontina vanish at Angelica's ring of virtue  and it is the fashion of the oriental fabulists to give language to brutes in general But to understand the language of birds was peculiarly one of the boasted sciences of the Arabians who pretend that many of their countrymen have been skilled in the knowledge of the language of birds ever since the time of king Solomon Their writers relate that Balkis the queen of Sheba or Saba had a bird called  Hudhud  that is a lapwing which she dispatched to king Solomon on various occasions and that this trusty bird was the messenger of their amours We are told that Solomon having been secretly informed by this winged confident that Balkis intended to honour him with a grand embassy enclosed a spacious

unexpected preparations  Herbelot Dict Oriental V BALKIS p  Monsieur l'Herbelot tells a curious story of an Arab feeding his camels in a solitary wilderness who was accosted for a draught of water by

which the camelfeeder hearing looked stedfastly on Alhejaj and demanded who he was Alhejaj not choosing to return him a direct answer desired to know the reason of that question  "Because replied the

Patient Grisilde is the next of Chaucer's Tales in the serious style which deserves mention The Clerke declares in his Prologue that he learned this tale of Petrarch at Padua  But it was the invention of Boccacio and is the last in his DECAMERON  Giorn x Nov Dryden in the superficial but liv  ly Preface to his Fables says  "The Tale of Grisilde was the invention of Petrarch by him sent to Boccace from whom it came to Chaucer"  Petrarch although most intimately connected with Boccacio for near thirty years never had seen the Decameron till just before his death It accidentally fell into his hands while he resided at Arque between Venice and Padua in the year one thousand three hundred and seventyfour The tale of Grisilde struck him the most of any so much that he got it by heart to relate it to his friends at Padua Finding that it was the most popular of all Boccacio's tales for the benefit of those who did not understand Italian and to spread its circulation he translated it into Latin with some alterations Petrarch relates this in a letter to Boccacio and adds that on shewing the translation to one of his Paduan friends the latter touched with the tenderness of the story burst into such frequent and violent fits of tears that he could not read to the end In the same letter he says that a Veronese having heard of the Paduan's exquisiteness of feeling on this occasion resolved to try the experiment He read the whole aloud from the beginning to the end without the least change of voice or countenance but on returning the book to Petrarch confessed that it was an affecting story  "I should have wept added he like the Paduan had I thought the story true But the whole is a manifest fiction There never was nor ever will be such a wife as Grisilde  Vie de Petrarch iii  "  Chaucer as our Clerke's declaration in the Prologue seems to imply received this tale from Petrarch and not from Boccacio and I am inclined to think that he did not take it from Petrarch's Latin translation but that he was one of those friends to whom Petrarch used to relate it at Padua This too seems sufficiently pointed out in the words of the Prologue  I wolle you telle a talè which

written by Nigellus de Wireker monk and precentor of Canterbury cathedral a profound theologist who flourished about the year  Or John of Salisbury Printed at Cologn in  The narrative of the two pilgrims is borrowed from Valerius Maximus  v  It is also related by Cicero a less known and a less favorite author  See Val Max i And Cic de Divinat i  There is much humour in the description of the prodigious confusion which happened in the farmyard after the fox had conveyed away the cock  Aftir him they ran  And eke with stavis many anothir man  Ran Coll our dogge Talbot and eke Garlond  Names

Strawe ne all his meine  Ne madin nevir shoutis half so shrill  c  v This is a proof that the CANTERBURY TALES were not written till after the year    The importance and affectation of sagacity with which dame Partlett communicates her medical advice and displays her knowledge in physic is a ridicule on the state of medicine and its professors  v    In another strain the cock is thus beautifully described and not without some striking and picturesque allusions to the manners of the times  A cocke hight chaunticlere  In al the land of crowing nas his pere  His voice was merier than the merie orgon  On massedaiès that in the churchis gon  Wel sikerer  Clearer  was his crowing in his loge  Pen Yard  Than is a clock or abbey horologe  His comb was reddir than the fine corall  And battelled  Embattelled  as it were a castill wall  His bake was blacke as any get it shone  Like asure were his leggis and his tone  Toes    His nailis whiter than the lillie floure  And like the burnid golde was his colore  v    In this poem the fox is compared to the three archtraitors Judas Iscariot Virgil's Sinon and Ganilion who betrayed the Christian army under Charlemagne to the Saracens and is mentioned by archbishop Turpin  v See also Monk T v  Here also are cited as writers of high note or authority Cato Physiologus or Pliny the elder Boethius on music the author of the legend  Organ  of

Ecclesiastes Virgil and Macrobius  Our author's JANUARY and MAY or the MARCHAUNT'S TALE seems to be an old Lombard story But many passages in it are evidently taken from the POLYCRATICON of John of

forty verses belonging to this argument are translated from the same chapter of the POLYCRATICON in the WIFE OF BATH'S Prologue  Mention is made in this Prologue of St Jerom and Theophrast on that subject v The author of the Polycraticon quotes Th  ophrastus from Jerom viz  "Fertur auctore  Hieronimo  aurcolus  Theophrasti  libellus de non ducenda uxore"  fol a Chaucer likewise on this occasion cites  Val  rie  v This is not the favorite historian of the middle ages Valerius Maximus It is book written by Walter Mapes archdeacon of Oxford under the assumed name of Valerius entitled  Valerius ad Ru  inum de non ducenda uxore  This piece is in the Bodleian library with a large Gloss MSS Dibg ii Mapes perhaps adopted this name because one Valerius had written a treatise on the same subject inserted in St Jerom's works Some copies of this Prologue instead of  "Valeric and  Theophrast"  read  Paraphrast  If that be the true reading which I do not believe Chaucer alludes to the gloss abovementioned  Helowis  cited just afterwards is the celebrated Eloisa Trottula is mentioned v Among the manuscripts of Merton College in Oxford is  "Trottula Mulier Salernitana de passionibus

Dryden and Pope have modernised the two last mentioned poems Dryden the tale of the NONNES PRIEST and Pope that of JANUARY and MAY intending perhaps to give patterns of the best of Chaucer's Tales in the comic species But I am of opinion that the MILLER'S TALE has more true humour than either Not that I mean to palliate the levity of the story which was most probably chosen by Chaucer in compliance with the prevailing manners of an unpolished age and agreeable to ideas of festivity not always the most delicate and refined Chaucer abounds in liberties of this kind and this must be his apology So does Boccacio and perhaps much more but from a different cause The licentiousness of Boccacio's tales which he composed  per cacciar le malincolia delle femine  to amuse the ladies is to be vindicated at least accounted for on other principles it was not so much the consequence of popular incivility as it was owing to a particular event of the writer's age Just before Boccacio wrote the plague at Florence had totally changed the customs and manners of the people Only a few of the  women had survived this fatal malady who having lost their husbands parents or friends gradually grew regardless of those constraints and customary formalities which before of course influenced their behaviour For want of female attendants they were obliged often to take men only into their service and this circumstance greatly contributed to destroy their habits of delicacy and gave an opening to various freedoms and indecencies unsuitable to the sex and frequently productive of very serious consequences As to the monasteries it is not surprising that Boccacio should have made them the scenes of his most libertine stories The plague had thrown open their gates The monks and nuns wandered abroad and partaking of the common liberties of life and the levities of the world forgot the rigour of their institutions and the severity of their ecclesiastical characters At the ceasing of the plague when the religious were compelled to return to their cloisters they could not forsake their attachment to these secular indulgences they continued to practice the same free course of life and would not submit to the disagreeable and unsocial injunctions of their respective orders Cotemporary historians give a shocking representation of the unbounded debaucheries of the Florentines on this occasion and ecclesiastical writers mention this period as the grand epoch of the relaxation of monastic discipline  Boccacio did not escape the censure of the church for these compositions His conversion was a point much laboured and in expiation of his follies he was almost persuaded to renounce poetry and the heathen authors and to turn Carthusian But to say the truth Boccacio's life was almost as loose as his writings till he was in great measure reclaimed by the powerful remonstrances of his master Petrarch who talked much more to the purpose than his confessor This Boccacio himself acknowledges in the fifth of his eclogues which like those  of Petrarch are enigmatical and obscure entitled PHILOSOTROPHOS  But to return to the MILLER'S TALE The character of the Clerke of Oxford who studied astrology a science then in high repute but under the specious appearance of decorum and the mask of the serious philosopher carried on intrigues is painted with these lively circumstances

carpenter to blissin him began  And seide now help in us saint Frideswide    In the mean time the scholar intent on accomplishing his intrigue locks himself up in his chamber for the space of two days The carpenter alarmed at this long seclusion and supposing that his guest might be sick or dead tries to gain admittance but in vain He peeps through a crevice of the door and at length discovers the scholar who is conscious that he was seen in an affected trance of abstracted meditation On this our carpenter reflecting on the danger of being wise and exulting in the security of his own ignorance

former that he has been all this while making a most important discovery by means of astrological calculations He is soon persuaded to believe the prediction and in the sequel which cannot be repeated here this humourous contrivance crowns the scholar's schemes with success and proves the cause of the carpenter's disgrace In this piece the reader observes that the humour of the characters is made subservient to the plot  I have before hinted that Chaucer's obscenity is in great measure to be imputed to his age We are apt to form romantic and exaggerated notions about the moral innocence of our ancestors Ages of ignorance and simplicity are thought to be ages of purity The direct contrary I believe is the case Rude periods have that grossness of manners which is not less friendly to virtue than luxury itself In the middle ages not only the most flagrant violations of modesty were frequently practised and permitted but the most infamous vices Men are less ashamed as they are le  s polished Great refinement multiplies criminal pleasures but  at the same time prevents the actual commission of many enormities at least it preserves public decency and suppresses public licentiousness  The REVES TALE or the MILLER of TROMPINGTON is much in the same style but with less humour  See also THE SHIPMAN'S TAL  which was originally taken from some comic Fren  h trobadour But Chaucer had it  rom Boccacio The story of Zenobia in the MONKES TALE i  from Boccacio's Cas Vir Illustr See Lydg Boch viii That of Hugolin of Pisa in the same Tale from Dante That of Pedro of Spain

 Bened Abb i Prae  at p xl lv I am of opinion that SolereHall in Cambridge mentioned in this poem was Aula Solarii The hall with the upper story at that time a sufficient circumstance to distinguish and de  ominate one of the academical hospitia Although Chaucer calls it  "a grete college"  v Thus in Oxford we had Chimneyhall Aula cum Camino an almost parallel proof of the simplicity of their

least evidently written  after the time of Chaucer It is the work of some tasteless imitator who has sufficiently disguised his original by retaining none of its spirit I mention these circumstances lest it should be thought that this frigid abridgment was the groundwork of Chaucer's poem on the same subject In the class of  umourous or satirical tales the SOMPNOUR'S TALE which exposes the tricks and extortions of the mendicant friars has also distinguished merit This piece has incidentally been mentioned above with the PLOWMAN'S TALE and Pierce Plowman  Genuine humour the concomitant of true taste consists in discerning improprieties in books as well as characters We therefore must remark under this class another tale of Chaucer which till lately has been looked upon as a grave heroic narrative I mean the RIME OF SIR THOPAS Chaucer at a period which almost realised the manners of romantic chivalry discerned the leading absurdities of the old romances and in this poem which may be justly called a prelude to Don Quixote has burlesqued them with exquisite ridicule That this was the poet's aim appears from many passages But to put the matter beyond a doubt take the words of an ingenious critic  "We are to observe says he that this was Chaucer's own Tale and that when in the progress of it the good sense of the host is made to break in upon him and interrupt him Chaucer approves his disgust and changing his note tells the simple instructive Tale of MELIBOEUS  a moral tale vertuous  as he terms it to shew what sort of fictions were most expressive of real life and most proper to be put into the hands of the people It is further to be noted that the  Boke of Th  Giant Olyphant and Chylde Thop  s  was not a fiction of  his own but a story of antique fame and very celebrated in the days of chivalry so that nothing could better suit the poet's design of discrediting the old romances than the choice of this venerable legend for the vehicle of his ridicule upon them  See Dr Hurd's LETTERS ON CHIVALRY AND ROMANCE Dialogues c iii edit    But it is to be remembered that Chaucer's design was intended to ridicule the frivolous descriptions and other tedious impertinencies so common in the volumes of chivalry with which his age was overwhelmed not to degrade in general or expose a mode of fabling whose sublime extravagancies constitute the marvellous graces of his own CAMBUSCAN a composition which at the same time abundantly demonstrates that the manners of romance are better calculated to answer the purposes of pure poetry to captivate the imagination and to produce surprise than the fictions of classical antiquity  SECT XVII  BUT Chaucer's vein of humour although conspicuous in the CANTERBURY TALES is chiefly displayed in the Characters with which they are introduced In these his knowledge of the world availed him in a peculiar degree and enabled him to give such an accurate pic  ure of antient manners as no cotemporary nation has transmitted to post  rity It is here that we view the pursuits and employments the customs and diversions of our ancestors copied from the life and represented with equal truth and spirit by a judge of mankind whose penetration qualified him to discern their foibles or discriminating peculiarities and by an artist who understood that proper selection of circumstances and those predominant characteristics which form a finished portrait We are surprised to find in so gross and ignorant an age such talents for satire and for observation on lif  qualities which usually exert themselves at more civilised periods when the improved state of society by subtilising our speculations and establishing uniform modes of b  haviour disposes mankind to study themselves and renders deviations of conduct and singularities of character more immediately and necessarily the obj  cts of censure and ridicule These curious and valuable remains are specimens of Chaucer's native genius unassisted and unalloyed The figures are all British and bear no suspicious signatures of classical Italian or French imitation The characters of Theophrastus are not so lively particular and appropriated A few traites from this celebrated part of our author yet too little tasted and understood may be sufficient to prove and illustrate what is here advanced  The character of the PRIORESSE is chiefly distinguished by an excess of delicacy and decorum and an affectation of courtly accomplishments But we are informed that she was educated at the school of Stratford at Bow near London perhaps a fashionable seminary for breeding nuns  There was also a nonne a Prioresse  That of her smiling was simble and coy  Her gretist othe was but by saint Eloye  Seyntè Loy  i e Saint Lewis The

v    The following anecdotes and obs  rvations may serve to throw general light on the learning of the authors who compose this curious library The Aristotelic or Arabian philosophy continued to be communicated from Spain and Africa to the rest of Europe chiesly by means of the Jews particularly to France and Italy which were overrun with Jews about the tenth and eleventh centuries About these p  riods not only the courts of the Mahometan princes but even that of the pope himself were filled with Jews Here they principally gained an establishment by the profession of  physic an art then but imperfectly known and practiced in most parts of Europe Being well versed in the Arabic tongue from their commerce with Africa and Egypt they had studied the Arabic translations of Galen and Hippocrates which had become still more familiar to the great numbers of their brethren who resided in Spain From this source al  o the Jews learned philosophy and Hebrew versions made about this period from the Arabic of Aristotle and the Greek physicians and mathematicians are stil  extant in some libraries  Euseb Renaudot apud Fabric Bibl Gr xii  Here was a beneficial effect of the dispersion and vagabond condition of the Jews I mean the diffusion of knowledge One of the most eminent of these learned Jews was Moses Maimonides a physician philosopher astrologer and theologist educated at Cordoua in Spain under Averroes He died about the year Averroes being accused of heretical opinions was sentenced to  live with the Jews in the street of the Jews  at Cordoua Some of these learned Jews began to flourish in the Arabian schools in Spain as early as the beginning of the ninth century Many of the treatises of Averroes were translated by the Spanish Jews into Hebrew and the Latin pieces of Averroes now extant were translated into Latin from these Hebrew versions I have already mentioned the school or university of Cordoua Leo Africanus speaks of  "Platea bibliothecariorum Cordouae"  This from what follows appears to be a street of booksellers It was in the time of Averroes and about the year One of our Jew philosophers having fallen in love turned poet and his verses were publicly sold in this street  Leo African de Med et Philosoph Hebr c xxviii xxix  My author says that renouncing the dignity of the Jewish doctor he took to writing verses

offend  rs into the archdeacon's court where they were very rigorously punished is humourously drawn as counteracting his profession by his example he is libidinous and voluptuous and his rosy

Saint Peter's ship  v s  q    The MONKE is represented as more attentive to horses and hounds than to the rigorous and obsolete ordinances of Saint Benedict Such are his ideas of secular pomp and pleasure that he is even qualified to be an abbot  There is great humour in the circumstances which qualify our monk  o be an abbot Some time in the thirteenth century the prior and convent of Saint Swithin's at Winche  ter appear to have recommended one of their brethren to the convent of Hyde as a proper person to be preferred to the abbacy of that convent then vacant These are his merits  "Est

albe that he was a philosopher  Yet had he but little gold in his coffer  v Or it may be explained  "Yet he could not find the philosopher'  stone"    His unwearied attention to logic had tinctured his conversation with much pedantic formality and taught him to speak on all subjects in a precise and sententious style Yet his conversation was instructive and he was no less willing to submit than to communicate his opinion to others  Sowning in moral virtue was his speche  And gladly would he learn and gladly teche  v    The perpetual importance of the SERJEANT OF LAWE who by habit or by

was  v He is said to have  "oftin yben at the  parvise  "  v It is not my design to enter into the disputes concerning the meaning or etymology of  parvis  from which  parvisia  the name for the public schools in Oxford is derived But I will observe that  parvis  is mentioned as a court or portico before the church of Notre Dame at Paris in John de Meun's part of the Roman de la Rose v  A Paris n'eust hommes ne femme  Au  parvis  devant Nostre Dame  The passage is thus translated by Chaucer Rom R v  Ther n'as no wight in all Paris  Before our Ladie at  Parvis  The word is supposed to be contracted from Paradise This perhaps signified an ambulatory Many of our old religious house  had a place called Paradise In the year children were taught to read and sing in the  Pa  vis  of St Martin's church at Norwich Blomf Norf ii Our Serjeant is afterwards said to have received many  f  es and robes  v The serjeants and all the officers of the superior courts of law antiently received winter and summer robes from the king's wardrobe He is likewise said to cite cases and decisions  "that from the time of king William were full"  v For this line see the very learned and ingenious Mr Barrington's Observations on the antient Statutes    There is some humour in making our lawyer introduce the language of his pleadings into common conversation He addresses the hoste  Hoste quoth he  de pardeux jeo assent  v    The affectation of talking French was indeed general but it is here appropriated and in character  Among the rest the character of the HOSTE or master of the Tabarde inn where the pilgrims are assembled is conspicuous He has much good sense and discovers great talents for managing and regulating a large company and to him we are indebted for the happy proposal of obliging every pilgrim to tell a story during their journey to Canterbury His interpositions between the tales are very useful and enlivening and he is something like the chorus on the Grecian stage He is of great service in encouraging each person to begin his part in conducting the scheme with spirit in making proper observations on the merit or tendency of the several  stories in settling disputes which must naturally arise in the course of such an entertainment and in connecting all the narratives into one continued system His love of good cheer experience in marshalling guests address authoritative deportment and facetious disposition are thus expressively displayed by Chaucer  Grete chere our Hostè made us everichone  And to the suppere set he us anone  And servid us with

CANTERBURY TALES was evidently left unfinished It was intended by our author that every pilgrim should likewise tell a Tale on their return from Canterbury  Or rather two on their way thither and two on their return Only Chaucer himself tells two tales The poet says that there were twentynine pilgrims in company but in the CHARACTERS he describes more Among the TALES which remain there are none of

ii It is omitted in the best manuscript of the CANTERBURY TALES MSS Harl fol membran These TALES were supposed to be  spoken  not  written  But we have in the Plowman's  "For my WRITING me allow"  v Urr And in other places  "For my WRITING if I have blame"    "Of my WRITING have me excus'd"  etc See a NOTE at the beginning of the CANT TALES MSS Laud K Bibl Bodl written by John Barcham But the discussion of these points properly belongs to an editor of Chaucer  A poet who lived soon after the CANTERBURY TALES made their appearance seems to have designed a supplement  to this deficiency and with this view to have written a Tale called the MARCHAUNT'S SECOND TALE or the HISTORY OF BERYN It was first printed by Urry who supposed it to be Chaucer's  Urr Chauc p  In the Prologue which is of considerable length there is some humour and contrivance in which the author happily enough continues to characterise the pilgrims by imagining what each did and how each behaved when they all arrived at Canterbury After dinner was ordered at their inn they all proceed to the cathedral At entering the church one of the monks sprinkles them with holy water The Knight with the better sort of the company goes in great order to the shrine of Thomas a Beckett The Miller and his companions run staring about the church they pretend to blazon the arms painted in the glass windows and enter into a dispute in heraldry but the Hoste of the Tabarde reproves them for their improper behaviour and impertinent discourse and directs them to the martyr's shrine When all had finished their devotions they return to the inn In the way thither they purchase toys for which that city was famous called  Canterbury brochis  and here much facetiousness passes betwixt the Frere and the Sompnour in which the latter vows revenge on the former for telling a Tale so palpably levelled at his profession and protests he will retaliate on their return by a more severe story When dinner is ended the Hoste of the Tabarde thanks all the company in form for their several Tales The party then separate till suppertime by agreement The Knight goes to survey the walls and bulwarks of the city and explains to his son the Squier the nature and strength of them Mention is here made of great guns The Wife of Bath is too weary to walk far she proposes to the Prioresse to divert themselves in the garden which abounds with herbs proper for making salves Others wander about the streets The Pardoner has a low adventure which ends  much to his disgrace The next morning they proceed on their return to Southwark and our genial master of the Tabarde just as they leave Canterbury by way of putting the company into good humour begins a panegyric on the morning and the month of April some lines of which I shall quote as a specimen of our author's abilities in poetical description  There is a good description of a magical palace v    Lo how the seson of the yere and Averell  April  shouris  Doith  Make  the busshis burgyn  Shoot  out blossomes and flouris  Lo the prymerosys of the yere how fresh they bene to sene  And many othir flouris among the grassis grene  Lo how they springe and sprede and of divers hue  Beholdith and seith both white red and blue  That lusty bin a  d comfortabyll for mannis sight  For I say for mys  lf it makith my hert to light  v    On casting lots it falls to the Marchaunt to tell the first tale which then follows I cannot allow that this Prologue and Tale were written by Chaucer Yet I believe them to be nearly coeval  SECT XVIII  IT is not my intention to dedicate a volume to Chaucer how much soever he may deserve it nor can it be expected that in a work of this general nature I should enter into a critical examination of all Chaucer's pieces Enough has been said to prove that in elevation and elegance in harmony and perspicuity of versification he surpasses his predecessors in an infinite proportion that his genius was universal and adapted to themes of unbounded variety that his merit was not less in painting familiar manners with humour and propriety than in moving the passions and in representing the beautiful or the grand objects of nature with grace and sublimity In a word that he appeared with all the lustre and dignity of a true poet in an age which compelled him to struggle with a barbarous language and a national want of taste and when to write verses at all was regarded as a singular qualification It is true indeed that he lived at a time when the French and Italians had made considerable advances and improvements in poetry and although proofs have already been occasionally given of his imitations from these sources I shall close my account of him with a distinct and comprehensive view of the nature of the poetry which subsisted in France and Italy when he wrote pointing out in the mean time how far and in what manner the popular models of those nations contributed to form his taste and influence his genius  I have already mentioned the troubadours of Provence and have observed that they were fond of moral and allegorical fables  See supr p  A taste for this sort of composition they  partly acquired by reading Boethius and the PSYCHOMACHIA of Prudentius two favorite classics of the dark ages and partly from the Saracens their neighbours in Spain who were great inventors of apologues The French have a very early metrical romance DE FORTUNE ET DE FELICITE a translation from Boethius's book DE CONSOLATIONE by Reynault de Louens a Dominican friar  See Mem Lit tom xviii p    to  And tom vii I have before mentioned John of Meun's translation of Boethius It is in verse John de Langres is said to have made a translation in prose about It is highly probable that Chaucer translated Boethius from some of the French translations In the Bodleian library there is an EXPLANATIO of Boethius's CONSOLATION by our countryman Nicholas Trivett who died before  From this source among many others of the Provencial poems came the Tournament of ANTICHRIST abovementioned which contains a combat of the Virtues and Vices  See supr p  the Romaunt of Richard de Lisle in which MODESTY fighting with LUST  PUTERIE Properly Bawdry Obscenity MODESTY is drowned in the river which gives occasion to this conclusion  "Dont vien que plus n'y a HONTE dans Paris"  The author lived about the year  is thrown into the river Seine at Paris and above all the ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE translated by Chaucer and already mentioned at large in its proper place Visions were a branch of this species of poetry which admitted the most licentious excursions of fancy in forming personifications and in feigning imaginary b  ings and ideal habitations Under these we may rank Chaucer's HOUSE OF FAME which I have before hinted to have been probably the p  oduction of Provence  But the principal subject of their poems dictated in great measure by the spirit of chivalry was love especially among the troubadours of rank and distinction whose castles being crowded with ladies presented perpetual scenes of the most splendid gallantry This passion they spiritualised into various metaphysical refinements and filled it with abstracted notions of visionary perfection and felicity Here too they were perhaps influenced by their neighbours the Saracens whose philosophy chiefly consisted of fantastic abstractions It is  manifest however that nothing can exceed the profound pedantry with which they treated this favorite argument They defined the essence and characteristics of true love with all the parade of a Scotist in his professorial chair and bewildered their imaginations in speculative questions concerning the most desperate or the most happy situations of a sincere and sentimental heart  In the mean time the greatest libertie  and indecencies were practiced and encouraged These doctrines did not in  luence the manners of the times In an old French tale a countess in the absence of her lord having received a knight into her castle and conducted him in great state to his repose will not suffer him to sle  p alone with in  inite politeness she orders one of her damsels  la plus cortoise et la plus b  l    into his bedchamb  r  av  e ch  valier g  sir  Mem Cheval ut supr tom ii p Not  But it would be endless and indeed ridiculous to describe at length the systematical solemnity with which they cloathed this passion  This infatuation continued among the French down to modern times  "Les gens de qualitè says the ingenious M de la Curne de Sainte Palaye conservoient encore ce goût que leurs pères avoient pris dans nos anciennes cours ce fut sans doute pour complaire a son fondateur que l'Academie Françoise traita dans ses premiers séances plusieurs sujets qui concernoient l'AMOUR et l'on vit encore dans l'hotel du Longueville les personnes les plus qualifées et le plus spiritualles du siecle de Louis xiv se disputer a qui commenteroit et et ra  n  roit le mieux sur la delicatesse du coeur et des sentimens a qui  eroit sur ce chapitre les distinctions le plus subtiles"  Mem Cheval  t supr tom ii P v pag  The ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE which I have just alledged as a proof of their all  gorising turn is not less an instance of their affectation in writing on this subject in which the poet under the  gency of allegorical personages displays the gradual approach  s and impediments to fruition and introduces a regular disputation conducted with much formality between Reason and a lover Chaucer's TESTAMENT OF LOVE is also formed on this philosophy of gallantry It is a lover's parody of Boethius's book DE CONSOLATIONE mentioned above His poem called LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCY  Translated or imitated from a French poem of Alain Chartier v  Which Maistir Alayne made of remembrance  Chief secretary to the king of France  He was secretary to Charles the sixth and seventh But he is chiefly famous for his prose  and his ASSEMBLE OF LADIES are from the same  school  So is Gower's CONFESSIO AMANTIS a  we shall see hereafter  Chaucer's PRIORESSE and MONKE whose lives were devoted to religious reflection and the most serious engagements and while they are actually travelling on a pilgrimage to visit the shrine of a sainted martyr openly avow the universal influence of love They exhibit on their apparel badges entirely inconsistent with their profession but easily accountable for from these principles The Prioresse wears a bracelet on which is inscribed with a crowned A  Amor vincit omnia  v  The Monke ties his hood with a truelover's knot  v  The early poets of P  ovence as I before hinted formed a society called the COURT OF LOVE which gave rise to others in Gascony Languedoc Poictou and Dauphiny and Picardy the constant rival of Provence had a similar institution called  Plaids et Gieux sous l'Ormel  These establishments consisted of ladies and gentlemen of the highest rank exercised and approved in courtesy who tried with the most consummate ceremony and decided with supreme authority cases in love brought before their tribunal Martial d'Avergne an old French poet for the diversion and at the request of the countess of Beaujeu wrote a poem entitled ARRESTA AMORUM or the Decrees of Love which is a humourous description of the  Plaids  of Picardy Fontenelle has recited one of their processes which conveys an idea of all the rest  Hist Theat Franc p tom iii Oe  vr Paris  A queen of France was appealed to from an unjust sentence pronounced in the lovepleas where the countess of Champagne presided The queen did not chuse to interpose in a matter of so much consequence nor to reverse the decrees of a court whose decision was absolute and final She answered  "God forbid that I should presume to contradict the sentence of the countess of Champagne"  This was about the year Chaucer has a poem called the COURT  OF LOVE which is nothing more than the lovecourt of Provence  See also Chaucer's TEN COMMANDMENTS O  LOVE p Urr  it contains the twenty statutes which that court prescribed to be universally observed under the severest penalties  Vie de Petrarque tom ii Not xix p Probably  the Cour d'Amour  was the origin of that called  La C  ur Amorcuse  established under the gallant reign of Charles the sixth in the year The latter had the most considerable families of France for its members and a parade of grand officers like those in the royal houshold and courts of law See Hist Acad Inscript Tom vii p seq  to  See also Hist Langued tom iii p seq  The most uniform and unembarrassed view of the establishment and usages of this COURT which I can at present recollect is thrown together from scattered and scarce materials by the ingenious author of VIE DE PETRAQUE tom ii p seq Not xix But for a complete account of these institutions and other curious particular  relating to the anti  nt manners and antient poetry of the French the public waits with impatience for the history of the Provencial poets writte  by Mons de la Curne de Sainte Palaye who has copied most of their manuscripts with great care and expence  Not long afterwards on the same principle a society was established in Languedoc called the  Fraternity of the Penitents of Love  Enthusiasm was here carried to as high a pitch of extravagance as ever it was in religion It was a contention of ladies and gentlemen who should best sustain the honour of their amorous fanaticism Their object was to prove the excess of their love by shewing with an invincible fortitude and consistency of conduct with no less obstinacy of opinion that they could bear extremes of heat and cold Accordingly the resolute knights and esquires the dames and damsels who had the hardiness to embrace this severe institution dressed themselves during the heat of summer in the thickest mantles lined with the warmest fur  In this they demonstrated according to the antient poets that love works the most wonderful and extraordinary changes In winter their love again perverted the nature of the seasons they then cloathed themselves in the lightest and thinnest stuffs which could be procured It was a crime to wear fur on a day of the most piercing cold or to appear with a hood cloak gloves or muff The flame of love kept them sufficiently warm Fires all the winter  were utterly banished from their houses and they dressed their apartments with evergreens In the most intense frost their beds were covered only with a piece of canvass It must be remembered that in the mean time they passed the greater part of the day abroad in wandering about from castle to castle insomuch that many of these devotees during so desperate a pilgrimage perished by the inclemency of  the weather and died martyrs to their profession  See D Vaisette Hist du Languedoc  om iv p seq Compare p Note  y      The early universality of the French language greatly contributed to facilitate the circulation of the poetry of the troubadours in other countries The Frankish language was familiar even at Constantinople and its dependent provinces in the eleventh century and long afterwards Raymond Montaniero an historian of Catalonia who wrote about the year says that the French tongue was as well known in the Morea and at Athens as at Paris  "E parlavan axi belle Francis com dins en Paris  Hist Arragon c  "  The oldest Italian poetry seems to be founded on that of Provence The word SONNET was adopted from the French into the Italian versification It occurs in the ROMAN DE LA ROSE  "Lais d'amour et SONNETS courtois  v  "  Boccacio copied many of his best Tales from the troubadours  Particularly from Rutebeuf and Hebers Rutebeuf was living in the year He wrote tales and stories of entertainment in verse It is certain that Boccacio took from this old French minstrel Nov x Giorn ix And perhaps two or three others Hebers lived about the year He wrote a French romance in verse called the  Sev  n Sag  s of Greece or Dol  pathos  He translated it from the Latin of Dom Johans a monk of the abbey of Hauteselve It has great variety and contains several agreeable stories pleasant adve  tures  mblems a  d proverbs Boccacio has taken from it four Tal  s viz Nov ii Giorn

Sag  s  It is said to have been first composed by Sandaber the Indian a writer of proverbs that it afterwards appeared successively in Hebrew Arabic Syriac and Greek was at length translated i  to Latin by the monk abovementioned and from thence into French by Hebers It is very probable that the monk translated it from some Greek manuscript of the dark ages which Huet says was to be found in some libraries Three hundred years after the  Roman  of Hebers it was translated into Dutch and again from the Dutch into Latin There is an English abridgement of it which is a storybook for children

Petrarch's refined ideas of love are chiefly drawn from those amorous reveries of the Provencials which I have above described heightened perhaps by the Platonic system and exaggerated by the subtilising spirit of Italian fancy Varchi and Pignatelli have written professed treatises on the nature of Petrarch's love But neither they nor the rest of the Italians who to this day continue to debate a point of so much consequence consider how powerfully Petrarch must have been influenced to talk of love in so peculiar a strain by studying the poets of Provence His TRIUMFO DI AMORE has much imagery copied from Anselm Fayditt one of the most celebrated of these bards He has likewise many imitations from the works of Arnaud Daniel who is called the most eloquent of the troubadours  See p supr He lived about Recherch Par Beauchamps p Nostradamus asserts that Petrarch stole many things from a troubadour called Richard seigneur de Barbezeiuz who is placed under Petrarch however was de  d

poets It contains verdicts or determinations in the  Court of Love    Pasquier observes that the Italian poetry arose as the Provencial declined  Pasq Les Recherch de la France vii p edit  ol  It is a proof of the decay of invention among the French in the beginning of the fourteenth century that about that period they began to translate into prose their old metrical romances such as the fables of king Arthur of Charlemagne of Oddegir the Dane of Renaud of Montauban and other illustrious champions whom their early writers had celebrated in rhyme  These translations in which the originals were much enlarged produced an infinite number of other romances in prose and the old metrical romances soon became unfashionable and neglec  ed The romance of PERCEFORREST one of the largest of the French romances of chivalry was written in verse about It was not  ill many years afterwards translated into pros  M Falconet an ingenious enquirer into the early literature of France is of opinion that the most antient romances such as that of the ROUND TABLE were first written in Latin prose it being well known that Turpin's CHARLEMAGNE as it is now extant was originally composed in that language He thinks they were translated into French rhymes and at last into French prose  tels que nous les avons aujourduy  See Hist Acad Inscript vii But part of this doctrine may be justly doubted  At length about the year in the place of the Provencial a new species of poetry succeeded in France consisting of Chants Royaux  With regard to the  Chaunt royal  Pasquier describes it to be a song in honour of God the holy Virgin or any other argument of dignity especially if joined with distress It was written in heroic stanzas and closed with a  l'Envoy  or stanza containing a recapitulation dedication or the like Chaucer calls the  Chant royal  abovementioned a  Kyngis Note  Mill T v p His  Complaintof Venus Cuckow and Nightingal    and  La belle Damesans Mercy  Have all a  l'Envoy  and belong to this

of the NEW POETRY and Froissart who has been mentioned above chiefly in the character of an historian cultivated it with so much success that he has been called its author The titles of Froissart's poetical pieces will alone serve to illustrate the nature of this NEW POETRY but they prove at the same time that the Provencial cast of composition still continued to prevail They are  The Paradise

Virelais Rondeaus and The Plea of the Rose and Violet  Pasquier ubi supr p Who calls such pieces MIGNARDISES  Whoever examines Chaucer's smaller pieces will perceive that they are altogether formed on

conducted by mysterious allusions to the virtues or beauties of the vegetable world to flowers and plants exclusive of its general romantic and allegoric vein  bears a strong resemblance to some of these subjects The poet is happily placed in a delicious arbour interwoven with eglantine Imaginary troops of knights and ladies advance some of the ladies are crowned with flowers and other  with chaplets of agnus castus and these are respectively subject to  a Lady of the Flower and a Lady of the Leaf  In a decision of the COURT OF LOVE cited by Fontenelle the judge is called  Le Marquis d  s

flowers Flora is introduced  "of these flouris goddesse"  The lady of the leaf invites the lady of the flower to a banquet Under these symbols is much morality couched The leaf signifies perseverance and virtue the flower denotes indolence and pleasure Among those who are crowned with the leaf are the knights of king Arthur's round table and Charlemagne's Twelve Peers together with the knights of

institution however fantastic soon became common through the whole kingdom of France and these romantic rewards distributed with the most impartial attention to merit at least infused an useful

early poets of Greece and Rome were fond of these creations Homer has given us STRIFE CONTENT  ON FEAR TERROR TUMULT DESIRE PERSUASION and BENEVOLENCE We have in Hesiod DARKNESS and many others if the Shield of Hercules be of his hand COMUS occurs in the Agamemnon of Eschylus and in the Promet heus of the same poet STRENGTH and FORCE are two persons of the drama and perform the capital parts The fragments of Ennius indicate that his poetry consisted much of personifications He says that in one of the Carthaginian wars the gigantic image of SORROW appeared in every place  "Omnibus endo locis

Seasons CALOR ARIDUS HYEMS and ALGUS He introduces MEDICINE  muttering with silent fear  in the midst of the deadly pestilence at Athens It seems to have escaped the many critics who have written on Milton's noble but romantic allegory of SIN and DEATH that he took the person of Death from the Alcestis of his favorite tragedian Euripides where ΘΑΝΑΤΟΣ is a principal agent in the drama As knowledge and learning encrease poetry begins to deal less in imagination and these fantastic beings give way to real manners and living characters  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME  AN INDEX TO THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY By THOMAS WARTON B D FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE OXFORD AND OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES AND LATE PROFESSOR OF POETRY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD  LONDON  PRINTED FOR LACKINGTON ALLEN AND CO  TEMPLE OF THE MUSES  FINSBURY SQUARE  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Index to WARTON'S HISTORY of ENGLISH POETRY which is here presented to the world was not originally intended for publication The great inconvenience arising from the want of its assistance must have been severely felt by all who have in the course of their literary pursuits had occasion to refer to this noble treasure of poetical knowledge To obviate the disadvantage as it related exclusively to himself the compiler at a period of leisure drew out the present Index The experience of its utility suggested the idea of multiplying the copies by which it is trusted that a commendable service has been rendered to literature Though none can with reason think these pages wholly useless some may not find it needful to their studies to possess them therefore it has been thought fit to suffer the impression of them to fall far short of that of the History It does not exceed onefourth of the number  Whether an entire Index of the three volumes together would not have been a plan more desirable than that which has been pursued is a question not now to be examined It has been considered and this is the reply The HISTORY of ENGLISH POETRY is an unfinished work The learned and elegant historian was "gathered to his fathers" almost in the midst of his instructive and entertaining labours Much yet remains to be done and as it is the reverse of improbable that some other foot we  faintly  hope  "passibus aequis"  will traverse the ground which he has left untrodden it cannot be denied that with regard to uniformity a separate table to each volume was the preferable mode to adopt  If an Index be copious and correct it possesses the first qualities belonging to the nature of such an undertaking This merit as far as human diligence could succeed the compiler claims with in his opinion the no mean praise of having been useful  INDEX TO THE FIRST VOLUME OF WARTON'S History of English Poetry
