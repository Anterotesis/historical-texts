 APPEARANCE IS AGAINST THEM IN A SERIES OF LETTERS IN THREE VOLUMES BY THE AUTHOR OF EMILY HERBERT OR PERFIDY PUNISHED  VOL III  LONDON  Printed for THOMAS JONES at his Circulating Library  BridgeStreet Westminster  M DCC LXXXVI  Just Published  EMILY HERBERT OR PERFIDY PUNISHED  THREE VOLS PRICE s d  APPEARANCE IS AGAINST THEM  LETTER the Thirtysecond  Miss ROCHLEY TO Miss LENOX  LONDON  I Have had a long conversation with my uncle my dear Harriot on the subject of a certain  lordbut let that rest a while that I may go on methodically  Orlando as I guessed at the conclusion of my last left me in order to follow his friend Lord Templeton for this purpose he bent his steps towards Mrs Bellmour's and met him just coming out of her house  Well cried my brother what news my lord have you had  an interview with the agreeable Miss Jane Brown  First tell me cried his lordship what have I to hope what says your charming sister did you succeed in pleading my cause will she deign to see me to pardon me to  Not so fast my good friend I have said all that could be said in your favour answered my brother  Isabella conscious of her innocence is a good deal hurt at your conduct she has a proper share of pride my Lordhowever  you  may possibly prove a better advocate than I have been  Shall I then be admitted to the happiness of seeing her have you my dear Rochley gained that point for me Ah if I am so fortunate I will not dispair  But I shall said my brother interrupting him and smiling of ever having my question answered if you go on at this rate I ask your lordship once more have you seen that insernal witch or not  Step in with me said my lord for they were by this time at his door and you shall hear every particular  Having desired to speak with Mrs Bellmour she came to me  immediately when I begged to know if Miss Jane Brown was at home  I believe she is my lord was the answer wondering I presume what my business could be with the girl and perhaps fancying I had now cast my eyes upon her having failed in my endeavours to succeed with the lovely Miss Rochleyshe rung the bell however without requiring any explanation  and ordered Miss Brown to make her appearance  In a few minutes in she came but no sooner did she see me than the roses left her cheeck and gave place to the lillyor in other words more suitable to the subject she grew pale as death and looked like the picture of horror and dismay  Taking her epistle from my pocket and presenting it to her  view though not with the greatest composure I must own when I reflected on the trouble and misery she had so knowingly and wickedly been the cause of pray young woman said I can you recollect doing me the honor of sending me this  My lord replied she with much hesitation and apparent distress I am not surprised at the questionI expected it from the moment I  heard of the change in Miss Rochley's situationI did send it my lord I indeed wrote it but severely have I reproached myself for being prevailed upon to become instrumental in so base so villainous a transaction to say I was bribed for doing it but adds to the crime I will not therefore attempt to plead that in extenuation of it  Yet thus much I must beg leave to say I was a stranger  then  to the  lady and was persuaded to believe some of the shocking circumstances contained in that letter were  true  I now know the whole to be false and am unfeignedly sorry for what I have done lady Beningfield my lord had art enough to  Lady Beningfield exclaimed I  Yes my lord it was herself who gave me the letter to copy  swearing in the most solemn manner the chief articles were matters of fact that it was with a view to serve your lordship she wished you to receive it and that if I complied she would not only give me fifty guineas in hand but be my friend as long as she lived  I was too easily prevailed uponI blush to confess itbut am somewhat consoled by the reflection that it has produced none  of those mischievous effects for which it was cruelly intended  I once had thoughts of leaving London in order to avoid this humiliating acknowledgment but when I considered that by so doing I should effectually screen the person who most deserved to be exposed I determined to wait the issue and if questioned which I could not doubt I should be relate the whole truth as the  only attonement I could possibly make  I have now done so my lordI am conscious I deserve your contempt onlyand from you madam turning to the astonished Mrs Bellmour I have nothing to expect but dismission from your house  We were both so amazed at what we had heard that 'twas some  time before either of us could utter a syllable  At last however great your guilt has been said I there is some merit in your so candidly confessing it your manner of doing it too is much in your favour I therefore spare my reproachesnay I will do more I will even intreat Mrs Bellmour to follow my example  Ah my lord cried the poor girl bursting into tearsthis is too much I was prepared to bear your indignation but this unhoped for generosity overpowers me  She was now near fainting with the violence of her agitation and so ill I was absolutely tempted to pity her wretch as she had been and  wretch  as she had made me  In short before I left the house I had prevailed on Mrs Bellmour to give her hopes of pardon and that she would continue her in her employment  And now Rochleywhat think you of that diabolical fury Lady Beningfield  Exactly what I thought before you begun your story for Isabella guessed it could be the work of no other  All I now wish is that we could hit on some punishment adequate to the heninousness of the offence I would give half I am worth could I contrive to expose her as she deserves  By Heavens my dear friend said his lordship I know nothing on earth I would not sacrifice for that purpose except your charming sisterbut we may yet fall on some measures for that purpose  at present I can think only of that most injured most adorable of women tell me now my dear Rochley when may I hope to throw myself at her feet  Your lordship I fear must first throw yourself at those of my uncle for to tell you the truth I am apt to believe you will find in him the greatest bar to your felicity  he  is extremely fond of his niece and does not think the  man lives who can deserve her particularly him who has presumed even for a moment to doubt her character though with such seeming proofhe will not easily pardon your giving credit to the story though  I  confess it was so plausibly framed that I cannot partial as I am to my sister wholly condemn you  But do not despairin me you have a firm friend and but  for this cursed affair could not I think have failed to find one in the breast of your at present rather angry fair one I told you she has a proper share of pride that pride is a good deal piquedhowever we must try what can be done  I will now go and inform my uncle of what has just past in order to pave the way for your lordship's receptionhe was partial to you once and doubt not in a short  time he will become so again so adieu  Thus saying they parted and Orlando came home where finding my uncle and your Isabella  tete a tete  he gave us the above particulars  I like his behaviour to the girl said he my uncle I mean there was something generous in that the poor devil could not resist a  bribe her letters have often found it too powerful for their honesty  she  is beneath our notice but that dnd lump of quality by Heavens I'll have her sent to bridwell she shall stand in the pillory and I will hire a mob to treat her as she deserves  We could not forbear laughing at the punishment he had found out for her my imagination beging pretty lively it at once set her  ladyship before me in that pleasant elevation  May I presume to hope Sir said my brother that all things considered you do not think his lordship quite so much to blame as he at first appeared to be  You may presume what you please Orlando said my uncle but had his attachment been as violent as he took pains to persuade  me it was he could not have been such a puppy as to be imposed upon by such a confounded improbable story  The fellow must either be a fool or a knave but I am inclined to suspect the latter  It is  now  his interest to pretend he cannot live without my poor girl and so he is come back to try what he can do to obtain her  No no had he married her when he believed she was not worth a groat I should have had a tolerable opinion of him but nowwho will thank him  But pray my dear Sir were you not at one time fully convinced not only of his sincerity but of his honorable intentions said Orlando had my sister acted as many others in her situation would have done had she permitted  him to visit her have you any doubt that he would gladly have married her friendless and pennyless as she then appeared to be  This rather staggered him Harriot for that he once believed so and had every reason to believe it he well knew  What says my Isabella to it turning from my brother to me  speak freely tell me sincerely whether  you  think he ought to be pardoned for his monstrous credulity as for your brother he must be looked upon as prejudiced in favor of his friend  Ah my dear Sir not more so I am sure than in favor of his sister  O hovery wellI see how matters are likely to go that expressive  ah  was not for nothing and so you can really find in your heart to think he is neither a  fool  nor  knave  but a very handsome and very insinuating fellow  Come out with it my love another  ah my dear Sir  kindly taking my hand and smiling in my face and his lordship's business is done  Indeed you mistake me Sir all I meant was to justify my brother I am sure he would be as tenacious of my honor as I could be myself never would he I am certain pardon any man whether his friend or foe who should presume to offer an insult to me  Was that all my dear child then I mistook you intirelywell then we are not to pardon him it seems yet I could have sworn by  a certain expression in your countenance a few minutes ago you were  more than  half inclined  o be merciful  We cannot prevail you see Orlando so you may tell his lordship he need not take the trouble of coming here to dinner to morrow Isabella forbids it and she is mistress here  My brother was delighted to find he had carried his point perhaps  I too  was not violently displeased but 'tis certain we were both highly entertained and diverted by the drollery of my uncle's manner  I soon after left them to settle the business at their leisure and with a heart as light as a feather sat down to repeat the whole to you  And so Harriot I am on the point of receiving this same lord  who has made such a bustle amongst us as a declared loverwell my dear he must e'en try what he can do in that capacity if he can contrive to  gain  my heart I have no objections but observe he has not yet done it though that he has occasioned a few palpitations in it now and then I cannot but ownbeing the friend of my Orlando is no small recommendation let me tell you that circumstance will go a great way with me  Don't you enjoy the idea of Lady Beningfield's standing in the pillory it would make a capital picture  Adieu my dear friendI must now dress as we are engaged to spend the evening at Mr Harcourt's  To morrowaye child to morrow will be a day indeed big with the fate of  "Templeton  and  Isabella"  ah these names will by no means dotoo long by half a hundred syllables the speech is ruined by them'tis a pity Harriot as I think 'tis my first attempt in heroics  Once more adieu I am and shall be ever most affectionately your's ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Thirtythird  Sir JOHN WESTBURY TO Sir JAMES HENDERSON Bart  WestburyHalll  DEAR JAMES  YOU must before this have undoubtedly heard of the sudden and most astonishing transformation in Rochley's circumstances  owing to the unexpected appearance of a rich uncle from India who had for many years been supposed dead but now to my chagrin and bitter disappointment "as I could wish the fellow steeped in poverty to the very lip" is this said uncle returned loaded with wealth which he takes pains to display with all the pomp and splendor of eastern pride and magnificence in order as I am told to do honor to the man  whom of all others I hold in the greatest abhorrence  Now Caroline will in a very short time be of age and of course her own mistress the consequence of which is easily foreseen as she will then most assuredly give both herself and fortune to him who has so long reigned over her infatuated heart  Sooner than this event should take place I would see her consigned  to the extremest penury and distress  One way there is to frustrate and perhaps render abortive their vile machinations and but one  You have often told me you liked the girl and was desirous of marrying her you have indeed offered such terms as proves you are in earnest if this inclination still continues I have a proposal to  make you which cannot I think fail insuring her your's if you coincide with my plan which is this  If you James will agree to play the Knight errant for once and carry her off to Scotland  I  will undertake to put her fairly into your hands to accomplish which I have a scheme that I am morally certain will prove successful  I would see that fellow dnd before he should marry a sister of mine he will triumph sufficiently as it is say the word therefore have you love enough to engage in this enterprize have you also a sufficient stock of courage for itshe has a cursed deal of the woman in her temper let me tell you that is to say a devil of a spirit so you must expect to be finely rated when she learns the trick we have played her  But what of that drive on without heeding her tongue your designs are  honorable  as they call it what would she have more  You cannot be less than three days upon the road she will be tired of scolding before you reach the end of your journeythe larum cannot last for ever and when you  have  reached it send instantly for the blacksmith  alias  the parson who will  etter you  both fast enough in the hammering of an anvil  What if she proves  restive  you'll perhaps ask what's next to be done  Why lock the door and order the fellow to read the ceremony in her hearing then whip her into the chaise again swear she is to all intents and purposes your wife or at least so much so as to prevent  her being lawfully the wife of any other  I  her guardian will on your return confirm the union this will terrify her if any thing can and finding no better may be she may chance to think the man she does not like better than none at all  What say you to this have you a mind to try the experiment I again swear by all that's sacred  Rochley shall never have her if I can by  any  possible means prevent it she deserves to be punished for daring to think of marrying a fellow who had nearly murdered her brother  Send me a line to let me know your mind take care however your messenger delivers it into my own hand I have a shrewed suspision a former one of your's which was indeed intended for  her perusal fell into her's though she denied it  We have no time to lose so be quick in your resolutions remember you are to be upon honoryou marry her Jamesno tricks upon travellersnothing less than matrimony mind that she is my  sister  Your's ever JOHN WESTBURY  LETTER the Thirtyfourth  Sir JAMES HENDERSON▪ TO Sir JOHN WESTBURY Bart▪  DEAR JACK  I Have just received your's I have often told you and with great truth that I would give  half my estate to possess your sister as I really love her  Your scheme is a wild one but if you absolutely think it practicable  I am your man  It is a new whim to run away with a girl by the consent nay by  the advice  of her guardian  It will be a devilish job I fear but 'tis a comfort the tongue of a  woman does not wound mortally so one may live to get over it  I enjoy the idea of jockeying Rochley too who thinks himself absolutely sure of her  Depend upon  my honor  the day she is mine I make a bonfire with your bond  Let me know how I am to proceed and you shall find me ready at a moments warning  Do you intend to be of our party Jack I think that would clinch the businessbut do as you like so as you grant us your  forgiveness  when at our return from the North we throw ourselves at your feet to demand it  Should she have scruples in regard to the insufficiency of the chains we shall be confined in I will marry her again when we come back with all my soul  What can a fellow do more but she may perhaps rather wish to knock off those she brings with her than straighten them you'll take care of that however  I send this by Frank who has instructions to deliver it with his own hand into yours for fear of accidents  I now only wait for the word of command which I shall impatiently  expect so my dear brother elect farewell  JAMES HENDERSON  LETTER the Thirtyfifth  Sir JOHN WESTBURY TO Sir JAMES HENDERSON Bart  WestburyHall  DEAR JAMES  BE upon the road to Stamford next Friday about five o'clock in the afternoon with your  postchaise c c I have agreed to take my sister to spend a few days at Lord Sandford's 'twas this intended visit put the scheme into my head  One of my horses  shall fall lame  but not till I perceive you at a proper distance then let your carriage advance with the blinds up as if emptyI will ask the postillion to convey us the few miles we have to go you may prepare him to agree to it  Sit snug in the corner and say nothing till I pop her into the chaise to this she can make no possible objections not suspecting any trick  When in I  instead of following her shut the door wish you a good journey give your horses a farewell smack and then getting into my own drive quietly home again there's a fine contrivance for you  No use in my going with you none in the worldmy  blessing  and pardon shall be ready when you return to ask it  Don't failbe punctual to the time and my life for it we carry the day  Your's as before JOHN WESTBURY  LETTER the Thirtysixth  Miss ROCHLEY TO Miss LENOX  LONDON  WELL Harriot the important interview so long desired so ardently solicited is at  length happily overand all things are  en train  Should his lordship on a farther acquaintance find or which is exactly the same thing to him continue to fancy I really do possess all those perfections his passion had decorated me with 'tis not difficult to guess what may in due time be the consequence  For to tell you a secret I actually believe  he  possesses many  more than I had given him credit for  As to his person 'tis infinitely more elegant than I should have insisted on I neverno never beheld one half so graceful so completely what a man ought to be excepting my brother who is in my eyes equally accomplished  But though this I grant is no small recommendation yet had I  found his mind and manner did not deserve so finished a casket believe me it would not have produced the smallest effect  A handsome coxcomb is of all beings to me the most unsufferable I have too long had a pattern of excellence before me in my dear Orlando to be easily pleased however I begin to think Lord Templeton bids fair to succeed  My uncle was for the first half hour of his visit rather stately and wavering in his opinion the idea of his having dared to think lightly of his Isabella whatever appearances might be against her still dwelt on his mind  He could not forbear a few severe hints on the subject but my Lord was so attentive to him made use of so many obliging conciliating expressions in regard to  his past conduct c c that before the second course was over I could plainly see he was intirely restored to his good graces and by the time they had finished their claret and joined me in the drawingroom to take their coffee 'tis hard to say which appeared the greatest favourite his lordship or me  My beloved Orlando is more delighted than I can express to  think the very man of  his  choice should prove to be the  man  of  mine  for this will certainly be the end of it and a very agreeable ending too Harriot don't you think so my dear  I had some thoughts of being more circumstantial more minute than I have been I meant to have told you as well as I could how we both looked when introduced to each other  in form  but I have  changed my mind'twas all very finevery pretty indeed as the old song says  Amongst many other questions in the course of the day I asked my lord who the elegant creature was who was with him and the  amiable  Lady Beningfield the first time he saw me  Guess Orlando's surprise and mine Harriot on his answering Miss Westbury  He now told us she had found so striking a resemblance between my brother and me that had not my name of Beverly convinced her to the contrary she could have sworn I was his sisterdrole enough is it not  Ah my charming Miss Rochley ▪continued his lordship▪ but for that unfortunate name I never should have appeared to you the guilty wretch you must have thought me  Nor I neither my lord smiling and therefore I shall detest it as long as I live  And don't you begin to find a kind of dislike growing upon you Isabella said my uncle with one of his arch looks for that of Rochley tooyoung women are very apt to tire of the name they have been known by eighteen or nineteen years  And do they never tire of that they are simple enough to exchange it for my dear Sirfor unless you can assure me they do not I will be in no hurry to part from mine  But if I can assure you of it laughing we are at liberty to suppose you do not care how soon that event happens is it not so my deardon't you think her speech implies as much my lord what say you Orlando  I desire they will take care how they presume to put a forced construction on any words of mine you my dear Sir I allow to divert yourself at your Isabella's expence but I would advise them to beware how they attempt to be witty on such a subject  See what it is to be a favorite cried Orlando my uncle may say what he pleases with impunity while my friend and I here are only at  liberty to  think  what we please was not this very saucy Harriot  Never will I said my lord taking my hand presume either to  say  or  think  any thing that can be displeasing to Miss Rochley  Aye aye this is fine talking said my uncle but make no rash vows my lord you do not yet know her so well as I do at present you no doubt take her for a downright  divinity an angelbut you will find her an artful insinuating little baggage for all that  I know not what you may take her for replied his lordship my dear Sir but this I know I can form no higher idea of felicity than to take her as she is  Well well when I am tired of her company perhaps I may make you a present of her  Not till then ah Mr Douglas  She will not by that time be worth your acceptance cried my uncle interrupting him and laughing is not that what you was going to say speak honestly  Indeed he shall not speak honestly I hate to hear disagreeable truths  Apropos  my lord pray have you been to pay your respects to your good friend lady Beningfield I wish your making so long a visit here may not tempt her ladyship to pay  me a second  Let her try that joke cried my uncle interrupting me and much disturbed by the recollection of what had passed by the lord she shall meet with a  warm  reception by heavens I'll trim her better  than ever she was trimmed in her life though it may not do for a birthday suit  We all smiled at his energy and my lord replied he had called the moment he found the infinite obligations she had laid him under in order to thank her as she deserved but was informed she had just set off for Dover in her way to Paris  Where I sincerely hope she will never arrive cried my uncle for I think the packet can hardly escape sinking that carries such a load of iniquity  May the first news I hear be that she is at the bottom of the ocean yet the poor fish will be sorely disappointed since they must be confoundedly hungry indeed before they will venture to attack such a mass of paint and corruption  We again smiled at the drollery of his expressions though in fact they were very severe and at the emotions with which he never fails to speak of her ladyship nor can one be surprised for by what I can gather from some hints Orlando has dropped he has not escaped the venom of her tongue in the letter before mentioned any more than I have donethe contents must be horrid I fancy since I have not yet been able to obtain a sight of it  I took an opportunity to ask my lord whether he had ever sent a person to enquire my name  He owned he hadadding that having seen me at my window two or three times he was so struck with my appearance that he could not resist it but after meeting me so unexpectedly in Mrs Bellmour's appartment he found he was no longer master of his heart  What followed Harriot you already know and what is still likely to follow you may without the second sight venture to guess  Having now brought matters this length I must bid you adieu I have a thousand engagements upon my hands a thousand things to see in this great metropolis to which I am at present intirely a stranger his lordship I presume being almost one of the family  will contrive to give us his company in all our future parties  My affairs being now brought nearly to a crisis as I said before our next care must be to conclude those of my dear Orlando engaged as he has been in mine he has not however quite neglected his own the sprightly epistles he frequently receives from his beloved prevents despair  In a few short weeks Miss Westbury will I fancy give him convincing proofs he need be under no apprehensions of losing hershort  I  call them but he makes a different calculation I presume  Farewell my dearest Harriot believe me at all times and in every situation of life your most affectonate and sincere friend  ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Thirtyseventh  Miss WESTBURY TO Colonel ROCHLEY  SandfordHouse  AS I believe my dear Rochley you interest yourself more in my affairs than any other person  I am now going to give you an account of an adventure that I have lately been concerned in which though I can now laugh at and allow you to  laugh  with me was by no means agreeable or pleasant at the time  You was terribly out of luck my good friend not to find yourself ready on the spot Don Quixote like to deliver your poor Dulcinea from the hands of the  base ravisher who made so bold an attempt to rob you of her for ever  Sadly out of luck I say for had you on so important an occasion rescued me from him I could not have done less according to all the laws of romance than have rewarded you with my  lilly hand  to kiss at least if not to keep  But you I suppose while your poor terrified Caroline was in such  a distressful dilemma was flirting away with some of your London Belles not so much as bestowing a single sigh upon herwas it so Orlando  To tell you a secret did I believe as much you should not be treated with the following delectable history  You must know my brother and I had promised to spend a  week or ten days at Lord Sanford's near Stamford and you know without my telling you his dear and worthy friend and companion Sir James Henderson has long fancied himself most violently in love with your humble servant a thing I absolutely deny fully convinced he is as incapable of  love  as the pen I write with  Be that as it will the creature had set his foolish heart on making  me his wifemy brother was if possible more desirous he should succeed than he was for reasons  best  known to himself though shrewdly suspected by somebody else  Thus stood matters when we set off on our intended visit  I had observed my plotting brother made a more than usual bustle on the occasion considering  it was but a short journey but little dreamt I was the cause  Well away we drovewhen behold just as we had got within a mile or two of my Lord's seat one of our horses fell lameor rather I presume the postillion had orders to say so for I believe it was no more lame than I was  I had before we set out expressed my surprise at my brother's  going with two only he gave some silly reason for it I forget what  I then however said had you as usual had four horses Sir John this disaster would not have been of any great consequence as we could have finished our journey with two but now I suppose we must enjoy the pleasure of tripping it on foot  At that moment an empty postchaise as I then thought it appeared in view coming towards ushe called to the driver who stopping was asked if he could convey us to Lord Sandford  The lad replied he had just carried his master there who he durst say would not object to it  I was very well pleased at being so conveniently accommodated  and followed my brother who giving me his hand put me into the carriage but instead of getting in himself to my astonishment hastily shut the door and told the fellow to drive on  I now found it was not as I had supposed an empty vehicle for to my utter confusion and amazement I beheld my torment Sir James Henderson squeezed into one corner of it  Merciful Heaven cried I who are you what am I to think of all this where is my brother how came you here these interrogations were all in a moment as I was almost out of breath with surprisethe horrid wretch now made an attempt to take my hand which I found means to prevent with a look of ineffable contempt  Hear me patiently my adorable Miss Westbury said the creature  and I will immediately explain this mistery  That I have long and ardently loved you you well know that your brother approves my passion you also knowI had every reason to fear you would soon bestow that dear that invaluable tho' cruelly withdrawn hand on another on one who though more fortunate in possessing the inestimable treasures of your esteem and affection  is not perhaps more worthy of those blessings than him you have so repeatedly so scornfully rejected  I could not bear the thought of being robbed of a felicity I value more than my life and have therefore had recourse to this innocent stratagem to get you into my power as the only method to overcome that unaccountable aversion you have so unjustly entertained for one  whose passion will end but with his existence  We are now my dearest creature on the road to Scotland where as soon as we arrive I swear to make you honorably mine by every solemn tie  Ah Heaven forbid interrupting his vile harrangue at the same time wondering at my own patience in listening so long to it  have you then the vanity the assurance to believe the being honorably your's would be a sufficient reparation for this horrid this unpardonable insult  No Sir do not deceive yourself be assured I would sooner perish than be your's at any time or on any terms  If these were my sentiments when in my brother's house can you  be absurd enough to imagine the affronting usage I have received will alter them and render me more complying or that you can possibly force me to marry you contrary to my inclination you cannot I think be quite so ridiculous though after such an instance of your wonderful contrivances and matchless confidence it would be very near  as  ridiculous in me to be surprised at any thing you either do or say  This is being rather severe Miss Westbury I own I flattered myself the sincerity of my passion which after this proof of it I believed you could no longer doubt would have induced you to treat me with more indulgence knowing too I am authorised by your brother in what I have done  Why surely you have not the effrontery to give this insolent behaviour as a  proof  of your love  But I scorn to argue the matter with you as I am sure we never shall be of one opinion so all I have to beg of you Sir James is that you will be kind enough to set me down at Lord Sandford's without loss of time on that condition I will endeavour to forget your egregious folly  No by Heavens madam I will not so soon nor so easily part from you with justice then might you  accuse me of  solly  if after having taken so much pains to make you mine I should suffer myself to be disuaded from my purpose  I have as I told you before your brother's consent and even instructions for what I have undertaken which will fully justify me in the public opinion for any idea of presumptuous temerity whatever it may do in your's which indeed I am most solicitous about  The wisest thing therefore my dear Miss Westbury you can now do is to make me the happiest of men by joining your  consent  to that of your brother'smy fortune my family  Talk not to me of your fortune and family were I certain you were heir to the crown of Great Britain I should hold you in as much contempt and detestation as I do at this moment  So pray Sir James order your postillion to turn back going farther this way you may be assured can answer no other purpose than exposing you you have an enterprising spirit it must be confessed but I am not such an ideot as to fancy you can succeed in this noble feat of heroism while I have my senses about me  He bit his lips with vexation my cool my composed manner provoked him beyond expression  Do me the favour to give the orders I desired continued I to your servants  Still he paid no attention to my request  If you will not Sir James I must so saying I made an attempt to let down the glass  Look ye Miss Westbury cried the horrid wretch holding my hands to prevent me by all that's sacred you go to Scotland on  this I am determined and if after being a week or ten days alone with me on such an expedition a woman of your delicacy can think it prudent to face the world in any other character than as my wife I shall have a worse opinion of you than I have at present  The story will be rather against you madam  People will not easily be inclined to credit you could be forced into  a trip of this nature 'tis not every day ladies are run away with against their will  I gave him the most contemptuous look I could assume but was silent  At length finding all my rhetoric had been ineffectual to make him relinquish his horrid purpose I resolved to make myself as easy as I possibly could till we reached  the next inn not doubting but I should then be able to interest some persons in my favour by whose means I might be delivered from the wretches tyranny  We arrived at our last stage about nine o'clock in the evening when I suffered him to lead me in  This condescension I really believe gave him hopes that his last wise speech had made a due impression on me  I desired the people of the house as soon as we entered to shew me into a room as I found myself much satigued both in mind and person  Sir James now took the mistress aside and as I suppose gave her a strict charge to be watchful over me fearing if left to myself I should elope from him  This was natural enough you know so I took no notice but  soon after followed our hostess up stairs  In about an hour he sent his compliments to me begging the honor of my company to supper  Down I went and in spite of my gloomy prospect and very whimsical situation eat the wing of a chicken the creature appeared delighted with my apparent change of disposition fancied all resistance  was at an end and that he should shortly triumph in the conquest he had gained our conversation indeed was uot very brilliant but I answered all his silly questions with chearfulness and temper  When I was going to retire which I did early he ventured to take my hand wishing to know at what hour I would chuse to proceed on our tour next morning  O I should not  chuse  it at all if I could possibly avoid it but if I must absolutely go one hour is equally agreeable to me as another  So saying I left him fully persuaded as I said before I should make no further opposition and as this was what I wanted him to believe I did not repent the moderation I had observed  The servant who conducted me to my room was a decent looking girlI at once told her the disagreeable predicament in which I was and added if you can contrive to get me a postchaise when all the family are gone to rest no matter at what hour this purse in which you will find ten guineas shall be your'sif not I must wait till I get to the next inn  The maid confessed her mistress had given her orders to lock all  the doors leading from my appartment and charged her to sleep or rather sit up in one adjoining to it in case I made any attempt to escape  However madam said she I think I may very lawfully disobey her orders on an occasion like this and certainly will do so  I am luckily wife to one of our postillions and if he is at home  I think I can easily prevail upon him to convey you hencenor can I imagine either our master or mistress will blame us when I inform them of the story  Go my good girl and see what you can do  Away she went and presently returned telling me I might depend on her husband's being ready with the carriage at a little distance  from the house this he proposed lest the noise of it might alarm the family  When all was quiet which was not till near three o'clock in the morning my honest friend conducted me to it I gave her the purse with which she was extremely well satisfied and got in bidding the fellow drive as fast as his horses could gallop to Lord Sandford's he feared it would be  too far he said without changing but said he would try what he could do  Away we flew like lighteningabout six we were within a few miles of his lordship's seat and as my apprehensions were now pretty well subsided I gave him leave to go to the next innthere I got another chaise took leave of my friend's husband having more than gratified him for his trouble  and soon after arrived in safety at Lord Sandford's  The servants were no doubt surprised at my early appearancebut judge how much more so my friend Lady Sandford was when on entering the apartment she beheld me seated at the breakfast table  I am amazed said her ladyship Miss Westbury  Even so my dear Lady Sandford you see I am an early riser  An early riser indeed but where is Sir John we expected you both yesterday  Sir John is for ought I know to the contrary in his bed at home  How do you mean my dear Caroline there is certainly some mistery in this your looks indeed  confirm it pray explain it for I am wholly at a loss to comprehend you  Why you must know said I very gravely I yesterday set off for Scotland on a matrimonial trip with Sir James Henderson but as we females will do some times happening to change my mind before I reached the end of my journey I left him to enjoy his nap this morning about three  o'clock and very quietly getting into a postchaise came here to make my apology for disappointing your ladyship yesterday  They now all stared upon me with looks of astonishment firmly believing I had lost my senses  Come good folks I beseech you give me a cup of tea for I am horridly fatigued I do assure you not having rested much since I  eft home so saying I began to help myselfdo my dear Caroline said her ladyship with an anxious kind of concern in her voice and manner tell us what you mean  ou really look so exceedingly  tigued that I am rather alarmed  d fearful you are not quite well  O perfectly so at present tho' say the truth I have been a  od deal hurried and very much sconcerted  This alarmed them still more and finding they began to b  seriously uneasy I at last told them the whole affair adding I mea  with their permission to make the  a longer visit than they perhap either wished or expected  Than we wish I am certain you will not my dear girl sai  his lordship nor would you I a  sure have proposed it had you n  known how happy you make all in so doing  My fingers are too much cramped with writing my dear Rochley to tell you all that was said on the subject of my marvellous adventure  Suffice it to add that I am safely under my good friends hospitable roof where I intend to continue till a certain day arrives which thank Heaven is not now far distant  I shall then expect that you will be kind enough to take me under your protection and should you wish to see me before that event takes place I am commissioned in the name of all this family to promise you a welcome reception  Even my very honorable brother has now I presume made his last effort to prevent our union he will never attempt any thing farther I am persuaded on condition  that this illconcerted and illfated plot is buried in oblivion  Beware then my dear Orlando how  you  mention it leave that to others if himself and friend have discretion enough to keep their own counsel it shall ever remain a secret for me  Do you think you can spare a day or two for an excursion to this charming place it is indeed  delightfully situated if you can I am sure you require no pressing to accept the invitation made you by this family  My lord is impatient to be personally acquainted with you to your merit he is no stranger Lady Sandford having said so much in your praise that I had no occasion to add my mitehe is a most agreeable and what is still better a most amiable man they  are indeed the happiest couple I at present know in a few weeks I expect and hope there will be another pair  as  happy I am studying the "art of pleasing" and the "way to keep him" from my lovely friendin the character of a wife I mean Orlando  Did you ever know a Miss talk with so much composure of matrimony as I doI believe not  But I hate all affectation all disguise and therefore without farther ceremony am going ingenuously and sincerely to assure you I am most affectionately your's  CAROLINE WESTBURY  LETTER the Thirtyeighth  Miss ROCHLEY TO Miss LENOX  LONDON  MY dear Orlando has just given me leave to send you my Harriot the inclosed letter from  his beloved which you will be much▪ pleased with the great length will not admit transcribing so must beg you will return it to me again as soon as you have perused it and at the same time let me know your opinion of Sir John and his very valorous and gallant friend Sir James don't you think they make capital figures  Never sure was there so foolish so preposterous a contrivance nor  one more easily eluded the poor creatures were at their wits end no doubt the road was not very long you'll say or they never would have engaged in so absurd so contemptible an enterprise  Don't you admire Miss Westbury how happy must my brother be with a woman so uncommonly amiable and so sensible of his great worth  My uncle who is now informed of their long and tender attachment and the difficulties they have had to encounter is quite charmed with her character and says she beats me all to nothing because I stand  shilly shally  as he calls it and do not know my own mind not having yet determined whether I shall accept Lord Templeton as  my lord  or refuse his generous offers  He forgets I have not yet been so long acquainted with him as Caroline as been with my brother but whatever my uncle pretends to believe or however he talks in such a jesting stile I dare say he has no doubt about the matter any more than his lordship tho' I have yet made no vows either way I do assure you  Orlando sat off for Lord Sandford's seat this morning what  transport must he experience to be at length at liberty to visit the mistress of his affections and freely to give vent to the grateful effusions of his heart  You never Harriot beheld so lively so chearful a creature as he is become judge then of my feelings who so truly have sympathised and lamented every misfortune that has happened to one so justly dear to me much more  as you know than I did my own and now so gladly participate in his present felicitous prospects  Do not my dear Isabella said my brother when just going to leave me play the tyrant to my poor friend let me find him as happy when I return as I am were I not from a thorough knowledge of  his heart  certain he is worthy of possessing  your's  believe me I would be the last to urge you in his favor  Promise me then my dear sister that you will put an end to his cruel suspence before I see you again  let me find your day fixed  Ah my dear brother interrupting him that is going rather too far you know it is impossible 'tis time enough yet to talk of  And why impossible or why  time enough  interrupting me in his turn can it be ever too soon  to act ingenuously with generosity and with candor or too soon to confer happiness on the man who adores you take example by my Caroline  Let her then  set  me the example let her name  her  day and I here promise my Orlando it shall be mine  Her's cannot be so early as my ardent wishes would make it you  know it cannot my sly sister or you would not be so ready with your promises  Why she will be at age in less than a month and consequently at liberty and the deuce is in it if the man cannot bear my tyranny as you call it during that short time when I am to take my chance of bearing his for ever after  You agree then Isabella to give him your hand on the day I receive my beloveds  I do I here promise it but for your life not a word of this to his impatient lordship'tis intirely  entre nous  mind that Orlando  I should hate  his  knowing my mind so long before hand though I wish to conceal nothing from you the creature would be so  triumphantly happy besides I should lose half his attentions his assiduity once secure of his prize he might chance to value it the lessso pray remember he is to know nothing of our agreement I made the promise merely to please you I do assure you Brother  Very well my dear I am much obliged to you laughing I shall certainly observe your directions  as far as I think them consistent and reasonable  Ah brother  And ah my dear sister again laughing but adieu till I have the pleasure of seeing you again saying this he disappeared in an instant  I saw him no more Harriot but in less than an hour came  Lord Templeton and by the joy that sparkled in his fine eyes which seemed expressively thankful I was fully convinced  he  had both seen and heard him  He did not however I must say give himself any airs upon the occasion nor utter one word tending to betray his friend who had certainly  betrayed me  We go this evening to the Opera his lordship is to dine  with us the Harcourt's also who are of our party Sophia is qnite in love with him and vows if I do not make haste to secure him to myself she will do her endeavours to rival me in his affectionsto tell you the truth Harriot I should be desperately mortified were she to succeed though I cannot say I am under much apprehensions  In about a month from the date of this I begin to fancy I shall  once more change my name in the mean time I intend to make the most of my present liherty  When a wife I shall give up all the follies of my youth and like Lady Sandford and as Miss Westbury promises be an example to all those who now figure in that sober lineI mean to astonish the world by my conduct it shall be quite on a new plan so wise so prudent so  Here he is again I declare and I am not yet half dressed when my head was decorated I sat down to my pen meaning to finish the business when I had finished my letter but that never happens till I get to the end of my paper for once however it must yield to so powerful a summons or I shall be an absolute fright  So adieu my dear girl I am in haste ever your's  ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Thirtyninth  The same to the same  London  I Plead guilty my dear Harriot yet you ought to make some allowance for my present situation consider how very near it is to the  time in which I shall cease to be Isabella Rochley though to whatever name I shall become intitled I can never  cease  to be your friend  This day fortnight Miss Westbury will be of ageand you know what the consequences of that long and ardently desired event are likely to prove no less than a pair of wives added to the venerable list of matrons  I need hardly tell you I am of course immersed in business mantuamakers milliners c with me from morning till nightcarriage jewels and so forth my delighted uncle and no less delighted lover have taken upon themselves to provide which is no more than they ought to do as you must allow and a most joyous bustle the good souls are perpetually in  I was compelled to confirm the hasty promise I had inadvertantly made to my brother as I soon found he had betrayed me which indeed I had before suspected to his friend the moment I had been drawn in to make it  Well it does not signify I do not intend to retract for since this grand affair must be complied with some time or other one would not differ about a day or two  I am heartily rejoiced the story of Sir John and his friend Henderson has not transpired I should like to be a witness to their meeting or rather to have been for 'tis no doubt long since past as I presume the latter would hardly be so fond of the excursion as to proceed on his journey alone  My uncle received a letter yesterday from the happy Orlando containing a very polite and pressing  invitation from Lord and Lady Sandford to himself your Isabela and Lord Templeton  They intreat we will all pay them a visit immediately and stay there till the awful ceremony is over His lordship's chaplain Orlando says has undertaken the important business of uniting us it seems he did the same good office for his amiable benefactors  After discoursing over the matter amongst ourselves▪ it was at length agreed we should without delay accede to their obliging wishes my brother presses it very much as he says he is impatient to introduce his Caroline to my uncle and me I long also for that pleasure no less than he does  You remember Harriot I once saw her though I little dreamt at that time either who she was or  of what is now going to happenshe is lovely beyond expression in her person and if I may believe my dear Orlando and her letters should be a transcript of it her mind is no less so  An answer was dispatched to my brother this morning desiring him to inform Lord and Lady Sandford we should do ourselves the honor to attend them next Monday to dinner  Before that time I dare say all my paraphernatia will be finished and I shall have nothing to think of but the day on which I suppose and am sadly afraid I shall look exceedingly like a fool but a person may submit to that for once in their life Harriot  I have given a good deal of employment to my friend Mrs Bellmour on this occasion we are both Caroline and myself I mean  to be presented at court immediately after our transformation so I have left the care of my dress for that day intirely to her I have seen many proofs of her taste and as I have laid her under no restriction in point of expence one may presume I shall be immensely fine  The poor plotting girl Jane Brown has hardly yet had courage to look upShe is I believe as sincere a penitent as ever sinned  and as I am sensible of this by many circumstances I have been particularly kind to her and no mortal can be more grateful  Adieu my dear Harriot I will if possible write again before all is over though I fancy I shall scarcely find more time for it at Lord Sandford's than I do at present busy as I amhalf a dozen lines you shall have however  coute qui coute  were it only that this may not be  the last opportunity I shall have of subscribing myself  Your affectionate friend ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Fortieth  The same to the same  SandfordHouse  HERE we are my dear Harriot and I defy the world to produce a happier set of beings our reception was exactly such as I  wished to find it Lord and Lady Sandford are a most delightful couple both handsome and pleasing in their manners beyond expression  Ah it is it is the very same charming creature cried Miss Westbury while my Orlando introduced me to her it is the lovely Miss Beverly with whom I was so struck some months ago your very picture Rochley never were  two creatures so much alikehe pressed her hand to his heart which seemed to exult with transport  And I my dear Miss Westbury could were it necessary bring many witnesses to prove that the elegance of your person and sweet affabillity of your manner made a no less favorable impression on me the partiality I instantly conceived for you was wholly disinterested  as I found no resemblance between you and any favoured loverperhaps I am as much indebted to that circumstance for your very flattering attention as to any other cause  Indeed but you are not smiling at the turn I had given her compliment it was wholly owing to your own charms not  his  I do assure you yet I will honestly confessnot if you listen though my good friend turning to Orlando who  stood looking at us with pleasure sparkling in his expressive countenanceyou are not to hear all our secrets don't you know Rochley listeners seldom hear good of themselves  No rule without exception my lovely Caroline and I am determined to believe the sweet confession you was going to make would have evinced it  Ah the vanity of some men smiling on him don't he deserve to have his lowered a little my dear Miss Rochley was he always thus vain  No indeed nor had he ever before you deigned to smile upon him so much reason who would not be  vain  thus highly honored  Heavens exclaimed the lively Caroline what an agreeable pair of flatterers  O cried Lord Sandford coming up to us just as she said this if you are only engaged in flattering each other I may as well break up your party since we wish for some share of your conversation but I shall change the nature of it I can tell you Lady Sandford knows I never could flatter in my life  And yet my lord said her ladyship I have not the vanity to  imagine you can really fancy I deserve all the fine things you so kindly say to me I should be too happy durst I believe them your real sentiments and perhaps too  vain  also  Come come cried my good uncle let me make one amongst you and I will set you all to rights presently nobody will  suspect  me I presume of that failing my sincerity has never yet been called in question  Then I know my dear Sir said I who has great reason to guard against a certain foible for if that is the case she must be the most perfect of all human beings  We were now Harriot interrupted by a summons to table which we found covered in the most elegant and sumptuous manner the entertainment indeed was such as would have amply  gratified the palate of the most finished epicurean but was nearly thrown away upon us  lovers  who chiefly feasted on each others looks  Happiness was depicted in every countenance and pleasure sat smiling in every feature the conversation as you may imagine was chearful and expressive of the satisfaction we enjoyed in our happy meeting  A good deal of company assembled in the evening some sat down to cards others to chat in the latter class were included Miss Westbury and your Isabella our beaux you may believe followed our example  Great things are talked of for a certain day we proposed a masked ball since they were at all events determined to make a show of us but to this my uncle objected  politely complimenting us by saying faces like ours were not made to be concealed a ball however is resolved on and half the country is to be invited  Caroline and her Orlando intend writing to Sir John on the occasion his having behaved ill is no rule to them his consent to their union is to be asked though it is in fact a mere compliment since it certainly does not depend upon  his answerwhat that answer will be Heaven only knows not very gracious we apprehend  Our good uncle has put it in my brother's power to offer such settlements as Sir John cannot refuse however he may object to the  settler  to your Isabella he presents twenty thousand pound on the day she gives her hand to Lord Templeton  Can I ever my friend be sufficiently thankful to providence for raising us so generous so noble a benefactor who with such unbounded liberality has contributed to our felicity may Heaven preserve his precious life and enable us by our grateful attention to his every wish render his latter days happy  Now my dear adieu ah Harriot I am going for the last  time to subscribe myself your truly affectionate and sincere friend by the loved name of  ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Fortyfirst  Lady TEMPLETON TO Miss LENOX  SandfordHouse  I AM actually married Harriotabsolutely a wife to all intents and purposes  Yet would you believe it I am still the very same kind of girl I was before the important event took place I do all I can however to assume a grave matronly appearance and try to give myself a few consequential airs but I make a sad hand of it nor does my sister succeed much better nay worse I verily think for she is if possible more giddy more lively than ever however time may do much indeed my lord insists  upon it I am already in every respect a pattern of all perfection  Orlando seems inclined to think that his Caroline alone merits that character though I believe he allows his Isabella is intitled to stand second on the list  Dear creatures all I ask of Heaven is that they may continue through life to think of us as  they do at present can we flatter ourselves this will be the case HarriotI dare not answer that question  Sir John has not thought fit to take any notice of either of the letters and as he did not his silence was taken as consent this he no doubt expectedthey did their duty if he would not follow their example who can help it  Lord and Lady Sandford have agreed to accompany us to town and to spend the rest of the winter there my kind uncle makes a point of it that Orlando and his fair wife are to take up their residence with him in PortlandPlace saying he should be miserable were he deprived of us both  As for poor Isabella you know Harriot I must follow my lord  and master his house is in PortmanSquare and I am told superb  And to that house Harriot I am  ordered  by him to give you an invitation which you are earnestly intreated to accept of immediately  Set off then my dear girl without loss of time come and congratulate your friend on her  felicity 'tis as perfect as I can wish and more so than a frail mortal has any right to expect but if there is a possibility it will receive a considerable augmentation if my Harriot will be so obliging as to indulge me with her company  I have some thoughts of making a match between you and my good uncle he can have no objections and surely you will not presume  to  object  becoming the aunt of one you have from infancy loved and who will ever remain  Your most affectionate and sincere friend ISABELLA TEMPLETON  FINIS
