 THE VOTARY OF WEALTH  A  COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS  AS PERFORMED AT THE  THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN  BY J G HOLMAN AUTHOR OF "ABROAD AND AT HOME"  Quid non mortalia pectora cogis  Auri sacra fames  VIRG▪  SECOND EDITION  LONDON  PRINTED FOR T N LONGMAN AND O REES NO PATERNOSTER▪ ROW    PRICE TWO SHILLINGS  PROLOGUE  WRITTEN BY WILLIAM THOMAS FITZGERALD ESQ  AND SPOKEN BY MR MURRAY  TO please the town is not a task severe  Wit will command a smile distress a tear  And he whose moral picture plainly shews  The tree of vice can bear no fruit but woes  That tho' successful long in fashion's reign  The villain's wages are disgrace and pain  But that the good by bounty wisely given  Can make this vale of tears resemble heav'n  With newborn comfort hush the widow's sigh  And wipe the tear from pallid mis'ry's eye  The Bard who thus employs his useful pen  Imprints his drama on the hearts of men  Commands respect from age applause from youth  And makes the stage assist the CAUSE OF TRUTH  Yet has an author many an anxious fear  As his probationary night draws near  When to his friends the manuscript is read  Each social critic nods the approving head  Most yield him flatt'rysome with jaundic'd eye  Glance at a fault and at a beauty sigh  But these are fewtrue genius still delights  To gaze with rapture at the Muse's slights  And scorns to triumph at a brother's fall  When Fame's wide dome is large enough for  all  Tho' none shall mount where Shakspeare sits sublime▪  The drama's monarch to the end of time  Within that fane they each a wreath may wear  Which nature's darling offspring hallow'd there  And seated at the base of Shakspeare's throne  Feel some small portion of his fire their own  Thus if they knew their int'rest wits wou'd be  By friendship bound in one great family  And if deserving all might reap the bays  From the rich harvest of the Public praise  CHARACTERS  OLD VISORLY  Mr EMERY  LEONARD VISORLY  Mr POPE  DROOPLY  Mr LEWIS  SHARPSET  Mr FAWCETT  OAKWORTH  Mr

your pardon One is anxious you know for the good of one's country  Lady Jem  You are anxious Mr Visorly for any thing that is to shew disrespect to me  Old Vis  Lord how you talkI shew disrespect to you  still reading  Lady Jem  There are you not still inattentive to me and my remonstrances Ah I might have known what I had to expect This is the consequence of losing sight of what was due to my birth and rank and marrying a commoner  Old Vis  My dear Lady Jemima why shou'd you urge that so often I am sensible of the honor and of my own unworthiness  Lady Jem  Still you pay no attention to what I  am complaining of Any thing I find is preferable to my conversation  Old Vis  Never spoke a truer word in her life  aside  My dear I shall have done in a momentI am among the deaths  Lady Jem  I wish to the Lord you were  Old Vis  Oh fie fie Lady Jemima  Lady Jem  You would provoke the patience of a saint  OLD VISORLY  starts up he has been still reading  What is the matter  Old Vis  Tol lol de rol  singing and capering  Lady Jem  The man is mad  Old Vis  Tol lol de rol  Lady Jem  What frenzy has seized you  Old Vis  Frenzy my dear only the frenzy that arises from good news  Lady Jem  Can't you give utterance to your good news without such absurdity  Old Vis  Well well I will my dear  reads  "On Thursday the th of last March died at an advanced age at Calcutta in Bengal"Tol lol de rol  Lady Jem  Oh mad mad  Old Vis  "John Cleveland Esqhis immense wealth devolves on his only son who is shortly expected in England" There is a fortune for our dear son Leonard  Lady Jem  How do you mean for our Leonard  Old Vis  Mr Cleveland the son and heir of the deceased is my first cousinI'm his nearest of kinThe old fellow who is dead was such a capricious sort of animal that he might have left every shilling of it away from his own son but now it is come into his possession it is in the fair road to our family  Lady Jem  This indeed is welcome newsand here comes our dear Leonard to partake it  Enter  LEONARD  Old Vis  Ah my dear boy  Lady Jem  Ah my dear son  Leon  Good morningHow do you do  Lady Jem  Here is news  Old Vis  Ah my boy we have news for you  Leon  Well let me have it  Old Vis  Why then  Lady Jem  No no Mr VisorlyI'll tell it him  Leon  I'll save you the troubleOld Cleveland is dead at Calcuttahis son inherits all his fortuneAnd the good news is that their  bulses  and  lacks  may eventually come to our family  Old Vis  Ay my boy  Lady Jem  Yes Leonard  Leon  I would not give five guineas for the chance of inheritance  Old Vis  No  Leon  No I know a little more of the circumstances than you do Mr Cleveland has a daughter  Old Vis  Poh poh somesomeyou understand me  Lady Jem  Mr Visorly I am shocked at your indelicate allusions  Leon  I wish they were well grounded but 'tis a melancholy fact that the daughter is legitimate and her mother Cleveland's wife is living  Old Vis  Dear me dear me  Lady Jem  How do you know all this  Leon  From the most positive informationCleveland's own acknowledgement He has written to me  Old Vis  Really  Leon  YesStating that as we were the nearest and only male relations he had to us he has taken the liberty of consigning his remittanceswith directions how he wishes them to be invested Understanding that your residence in London was only casual and also thinking the trouble of business more suited to my time of life he thought it better to address his letter to me In it he explains all the particulars of his marriage and recommends his wife and daughter to our attention  Lady Jem  Howare they not with him  Leon  No His daughter we may hourly expectNot being able to settle his affairs immediately on the death of his father he sent her before him unwilling to detain her from her mother  Lady Jem  Why is the mother in England  Leon  Yesand has been for several years His marriage was without the consent of his father and for some time unknown to himEnraged when he discovered it he insisted on a separationto avoid ruin which would have been the consequence of his father's resentment he was forced to comply The child was suffered to remain with himThe wife was doom'd to return to England where for these fifteen years she has lived in retirement  Old Vis  Well what is to be done  Lady Jem  They are recommended it seems to our attention but really I don't well see how I can reconcile to myself taking notice of and introducing to my acquaintances people one doesn't know whoand that have been living one doesn't know where  Leon  What do you talk of Are they not the  wife and daughter of a nabob Your highbred friends will worship you for the introduction Think what will be the magnificence of their house the splendour of their equipage the brilliancy of their entertainments Such suppers as theirs will be the fashionable world would scramble for a seat at even if they were given by a personage from a hotter place than Bengal  Old Vis  Leonard says very truly We shall get credit by shewing such gold pheasants to our friends  Leon  Certainly for all will be charmed with the splendour of their plumageeven those who are so little fashionable as not to attempt plucking the feathers  Old Vis  Well we must prepare to shew them all possible civility  Leon  Ay ay pray let us for I have something in view that will pay us for our trouble  Lady Jem  What is that son  Leon  The hope of making the young lady a part of our family  Old Vis  What an excellent thought Ah Leonard Leonard you are a cunning rogue  Lady Jem  You amaze me child that you don't extend your viewsMy son the grandson of the earl of Castlegreat ought to aspire to the proudest heiresses of the noblest peersnot stoop to a thing of mushroom growth  Leon  Consider mother  this  mushroom is the growth of a golden soil  Lady Jem  Well son pursue your own inclinations my affection for you will always make me yield to your wishes  Leon  Then this glorious fortune may be mine Invite them to your house The mother having  long experienced a constrained seclusion from society will doubtless be gratified with attentions from a woman of your rankthe daughter is youngI don't despair of success with her and the preference the father has shewn in the trust consigned to me makes me hope every thing from him So all seems fair for my success and half a million at least is the prize Think of thatthink of that  Enter  Servant  Serv  A person below desires to speak with you Sir  to Leonard  Leon  What is his name  Serv  He says his own name is immaterial but he desired me to mention the name of Cleveland  Leonard  Shew him up directly  Exit  Servant  and enter  OAKWORTH  Leon  You are welcome Sir  Oakw  Thank you Sir thank you So I be got to you at last You great folks take a plaguy time coming at Ma'am your humble servant Mayhap I should say your LadyshipPray excuse all faults  Leon  Never mind Lady Jemima doesn't stand on ceremony  Oakw  Don't she Why then Lady Jemima is a lady just after my own heart  Old Vis  Well Siryou come concerning Mr Cleveland  Oakw  Why yes Sir yes You must know Sir that I am an old fellow that remember Mrs Cleveland Heaven bless her when she was not the height of my knee Often and often is the time that I have danced her o'top of it Well that is neither here nor there When her father  diedAh I shall never forget ithe has not left a better man behind himthere was not a dry eye in the village except the undertaker's and folks do say he cried a bit Well her father good soul had met with so many losses and crosses that there was little enough left for his daughter to live like a lady on so she was persuaded by her friends to take a voyage to India with a cousin of her's who had married and was going to settle there  Leon  Mr Cleveland has acquainted me with the rest There he married her and from thence by the severity of his father he was forced to send her  Oakw  Ah poor dear home she came again miserable enough to be sure Well mayhap all for the best now she will be as happy as the day is long But for this many a year she has led but a lonesome sort of a life for you may think my dame and I though we love her like a child of our own can't have been company good enough for her but she was as kind to us and made as much of us as though we had been the best people in the land  Lady Jem  We shall soon I hope have the pleasure of receiving her in this house She must not think of seeing any other habitation  Leon  Oh certainly not She must make this her abode  Old Vis  Oh to be sure to be sure  Oakw  Why do you know now this is the very thing that came into my head and that I told her ofSays I as sure as I am a sinner if those relations of Mr Cleveland's have the least bit of kindheartedness about them they'll never let you live in any house but their own  Leon  CertainlyHow right you were  Oakw  And I am glad to find such friendly good souls in this great town of Londonfor do you know I had got a notion of its being but a bad sort of a place  Leon  I trust you will find it otherwise  Oakw  Why I hope I shall  Lady Jem  When did Mrs Cleveland arrive  Oakw  But last night  Lady Jem  And where is she  Oakw  Why she is at aat aWhat the plague do you call it It is the like of an inn only it goes by a finer name  Leon  Oh an Hotel  Oakw  Ay ay an Hotel  Leon  But what Hotel  Oakw  Od rabbit it I forget the name of it but I can ask the man who shewed me the way here for as I never was in London before I can't travel without a guide He waits below to take me back againhe will tell me  going  Lady Jem  Stay Sir he shall direct us both The carriage is waiting and I will not lose a moment in paying my respects to Mrs Cleveland  Oakw  Well now that is kind of you indeed my lady I will leave the direction below stairs and go on before  Leon  By no means Lady Jemima will take you in the carriage with her  Oakw  Why you are joking sure  Lady Jem  aside to Leon  My dear Leonard think if I should meet any of my friends with this Bumpkin for my  Cicisbeo  Leon  Oh mother to oblige me  aside  My mother is ready to attend you Sir  Oakw  Psha Psha no tricks upon travellers Her ladyship ride with such a lout as  me  Lady Jem  It may well surprize you  aside  Oh Sir I shall be proud of the honour  Oakw  The honour that is a good one Come then my lady Lord how my dame would laugh to see me seated in a coach with a Lady Jemima  Exeunt  OAKWORTH  and Lady  JEMIMA  Leon  Won't you accompany my mother Sir I have business which must detain me  Old Vis  Yes yes I will go with you Lady Jemima  calling after her  I say Leonard where will her Ladyship wish the rustic if she meets any of her noble relatives Ha ha 'tis a good jokeAh Leonard you are a droll dog  Exit  Manet  LEONARD  If my designs succeed on what a pinnacle of fortune shall I be placed The independence bequeathed me by my grandfather I have turned to good account What though it has been the means of effecting the ruin of a few thoughtless profligates There vices were incurable and they would have been as completely beggared by the skilful operations of others if all my thoughts had been engaged in the exercise of devotion and my guineas appropriated to charitable donationsNay to preserve my estimation with the world I have raised from the earth those whom others less mindful of opinion would have left groveling in miseryPsha when I scrutinize my conduct with an eye half inclined to condemnation I find matter for praise instead of censure Dupes will be dupesKnaves will make their prey of themand lucky is the dupe that becomes the prey of a knave with some conscience and a great regard for a good reputation Whom have we here  Enter  SHARPSET  dressed as a Methodist Preacher  Shar  Peace be unto this house  Leon  Who is this With what Hedge Divine have I the honour of an acquaintance  Shar  Thy name is Leonard Visorly  Leon  Well Sir what is your business  Shar  To discourse with thee on the state of thy conscience  Leon  I request you will save yourself that trouble my conscience is a charge of which I choose to have the sole guardianship  Shar  But it is my duty to inquire whether thou hast treated that precious charge like unto a faithful guardianWhether thou hast not stained with guilt that which was consigned to thy care spotless and pure and which now goads thee with complainings for thy iniquity Therefore I say  Leon  You shall say no more in this house Out with you directly  offering to push him out  Shar  Oh Leonard Leonard is this the way you treat an old friend after so long an absence  Leon  An old friendWhat do you mean Who are you  Shar  And so my reverend appearance has concealed from your recognition your friend and brother in iniquity Jeremy Sharpset  Leon  Sharpset  Shar  The very same  Leon  But what is the meaning of this transformation  Shar  The restlessness of my disposition and inclination for any pursuit in preference to laudable exertion and honest industry  Leon  You always had a propensity to confess your faults  Sharp  Yes but not much propensity to amend them To be sure I shewed a little disposition towards it by quitting you  Leon  Your most humble servant  Shar  I am afraid you felt the loss of me  Leon  Yes I confess itYou were very serviceable  Shar  Yes I was I did the roguery and you received the profits  Leon  Come comeYou were not ill paid  Shar  Oh noI don't complain How is poor Drooply  Leon  Still the creature of my bounty  Shar  Well that is kind of youA generous weakness in your characterYou swindled him out of two thousand a year and are good enough to allow him a hundred Ah you are a model of philanthropy  Leon  Come a truce with your sarcasm  Shar  Ah bless your honest tender heart He is as grateful to you as ever I conclude  Leon  Yes he esteems me his friend and preserver  Shar  Poor fellow "He was wont to set the table in a roar now quite chopfallen" I declare I never think of him but with a heartache  Leon  Well wellbut what have you been doing since we parted  Shar  All sorts of things I ought not to do To confess the truth the reason I quitted you was I was tired of the work you chalked out for meYou wanted to push me a little farther in roguery than I liked I am but a petty larceny villainThat ruin of poor Drooply in which I was the chief engine for youthat hit me hard I am foolish enough to have qualms I know you despise me for it but we all have our weaknesses  Leon  Well well but what became of you  Shar  I'll tell you I had unluckily once in my life dined at a Lord Mayor's feastI shall never forget it Talk of Earls and Dukes entertainingPsha a rivulet to the ocean Ever after I panted for City honoursSo all my  honest  earnings I was determined to deposit in trade An opportunity soon offeredI was to become a sleeping partner in a great house I paid down my cash to the last guineaA docket was struck against the firm the very next week so the poor sleeping partner had nothing but the open air for his slumbers and instead of being in the road to claim a seat at a Guildhall dinner I had scarcely enough to purchase one in Porridge Island  Leon  So all your hopes of a gold chain vanished  Shar  Yes and I was in a very likely way to be adorned with an iron onebut I was resolved to take myself out of the reach of temptation and danger by leaving London  Leon  In what capacity did you travel  Shar  Still I had a taste for partnership I engaged with a very respectable Gentleman to divide with him the attention and profits of  Leon  Of what  Sharp  A collection of wild beasts  Leon  I guess you were not a sleeping partner here  Sharp  No my companions were rather hostile to repose Not much liking such uncivilized society and being a little apprehensive that my fellowtravellers might one time or other make a supper of me I soon cut this connection and instead of exhibiting the merits of others I got a taste for displaying my own  Leon  How pray  Shar  I joined a party of strolling players  Leon  Indeed  Shar  I know you must be shocked at my descending so damn'd low as to turn actor But I did not disgrace myself long  Leon  How happened that  Shar  The audience would not let me  Leon  How so  Shar  I came out in Richard the Third I thought it devilish fine but the good folks in the front thought otherwise I rantedthey hootedHowever I outroared them and pushed on till I got into Bosworth Field"A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse" When a drunken Foxhunting squire I shall never lose the sound of his damn'd voice bawled out of the boxes that I should have the best horse in his stable if I would ride away directly and never come back again  Leon  Ha ha ha  Shar  The actor's warn'd me it would not do I thought it envy in them and have some reason to think they sent in a party to hiss me However by way of comfort they told me though I should never act tragedy they thought I should succeed in low comedyLow comedy only think of their impudence Is this a face for low comedy No no damn it I could not stoop to that  Leon  Well your next resource  Shar  Oh then I got a call and mounted the habiliments in which you see me this was lucrative but my conscience would not suffer me any longer to drain from the pockets of the poor the earnings of their industry nay what is worse embitter their innocent minds with groundless terrors and inspire them with prejudice against their fellowcreatures  Leon  So then you deign at last to return to me  Shar  Yes for I had rather cheat the rich than delude the poor  Leon  Well well I'll endeavour to find you employment  Shar  That I don't doubt as long as there is a pigeon to be plucked and as I am disposed to be a rook at your service  Leon  No I have at present honester objects in view to attain which I may need your assistance  Shar  Well I'm glad of that for upon my soul I am tired of being a rogue  Leon  If I reach the point of my present aim I may myself relinquish that character I shall then have wealth enough to gratify even  my  ambition I am no further a knave than as it forwards my grand pursuit the attainment of wealth And who would not use any means to gain that which covers vice with the garb of respect and without which virtue meets but pity or derision  Shar  Well observed and never was observation more patly illustrated You are a glorious instance of the first part of your sentiment and here comes a proof of the latter  SHARPSET  walks up the Stage  Enter  DROOPLY  Leon  Ah Drooply how do you do  Dro  How do you do my dear fellow  Leon  Where have you hid yourself nobody has seen you of late  Dro  I have been striving to follow the example of my acquaintances and learning to be as shy of them as they are of me  Leon  Why what an altered being you are you used to be a merry fellow  Dro  Yes for I used to be a rich fellow  Leon  Come come cheer up Good spirits are a man's best friends  Dro  Ay but like the rest of his friends when his money leaves him they leave him too  Leon  Nay nay your friends have not all deserted you  Dro  All but you There is not another man in the world who would care a straw if the devil had one  Leon  If you are so despondent I must recommend you a spiritual comforter Can your reverence administer consolation to this afflicted being  to  Sharpset  Shar  No for I can't return him the money I won of him  Dro  Whom have we here  Shar  What not remember me If I had done you a kindness I might expect to be forgotten▪ but I thought every one remembered an illturn  Leon  In this pious pastor you behold a quondam acquaintance Mr Sharpset  Dro  What Sharpset turned Methodist  Shar  Yes but don't wrong my understandingOnly from necessity  Leon  You might triumph now if you were disposed to indulge spleen for the man who was the chief gainer by your losses at play is now as low in the world as yourself  Shar  No I am so completely without gratification I have not even the comfort a malicious disposition would afford me It is far from a relief to me to see another unfortunate  Leon  You are mutually distressed yet how differently you bear your misfortunes  Shar  That is easily accounted for I have a thousand resourcesDrooply has none Born to no other inheritance I have learned to turn to account  what I inherit from nature so that tho' my acquisitions have been squandered I am still in possession of my original patrimony  Dro  Ah you lucky dog you have an estate in every corner of your brain and a pretty income at the end of every finger Now the whole produce of my skull would not get me change for sixpence and as for my hands curse them they are fit for nothing but to dangle by my sides or stuff out my coatpockets  Leon  Why I am afraid they will never fill your pockets with any thing but themselves  Dro  Oh I wish I had been a Turk  Leon  A Turk  Dro  Yes a Turk they are the only wise people on earth they teach all their great men some honest employment  Leon  Do they I know some great men I wish they would give a lesson to  Dro  Oh if we had that good mussulman custom among us how many a rich man would be of more use to society when his estate was gone than while he possessed it as a good cobler is a more valuable character than a rich man who does not employ his wealth properly  Leon  Why you are turning moralist  Dro  Yes the loss of wealth seldom lessens a man's morality While I am creeping about such a piece of moving lumber what respect I feel for every reputable tinker that comes in my way This very morning how I did envy a merry rogue of a shoeblack With what glee he put the polish of an artist on the boot he was blacking how merrily he brushed and sung and how conceitedly and happily he looked at his work when he had done it Oh you jolly dog thought I what a happy man had been spoiled if you had been born  to two thousand a year you would never have enjoyed the luxury of polishing a shoe or the independent exultation of existing by your own industry  Leon  We must endeavour to dispel your melancholy You are a martyr to  ennui  I must find you employment  Dro  You must do something besidefind me capacity  Leon  That you don't want Your talents have been only slumbering  Dro  Hav'n't they they have had a pretty long nap and a sound one too I'm afraid it will be a hard matter to wake them  Leon  I don't despair especially when I shall set the loud voice of friendship to rouse them  Dro  If they don't wake at that call you may take your oath their slumber is everlasting But tho' I am master of this poor tenement I really am so ignorant of the state of the  upper story  as not to know whether the inhabitants have perished by neglect or are only dozing from want of employment but this I do know there is a lively fellow in the  first floor  pointing to his heart  who would dance with joy to do you the slightest service and lose every drop of blood to prove his friendship and gratitude  Exeunt  ACT II  SCENE I  An Apartment in  Visorly's  House  Enter  LEONARD  and  CAROLINE  Car  Yes I have not been in town above half an hour  Leon  Have you brought with you from the country house the box which I told you contains the writings of your property  Car  Yesshall I give it to you  Leon  No I am too busy at presentOnly take care of it  Car  Well my dear brother I am so glad we are to have our house full of

worldand then at night driving to twenty different assembliesseeing the whole world in the course of an eveningOh dear dear what a charming age to live in we see more of life in one day than our ancestors did in their whole existence  Leon  Yes but I doubt whether we are the happier for it  Car  To be sure we are What is all this but happiness care can never reach us for in all this hurry nobody has time to think and you know it is thinking makes one unhappy  Leon  Well I'm not Cynic enough to attempt to reason people out of their notions of happiness for as it exists in imagination the idea is the  reality But my dear Caroline I have told you my wish to be thought well of by this young East Indian From living in the same house and being nearly of an age you will most likely contract a friendship  Car  Yes and her taking my brother for her lover will be the best security for that friendship for then we can't be rivalsand nothing is so apt to make young ladies disagree as being both of the same mind  Old  VISORLY  without  This way Mrs Cleveland  Leon  Here comes the mother  Enter Mrs  CLEVELAND  Lady  JEMIMA  and old  VISORLY  Old Vis  Believe me madam we experience

residence here not entirely disagreeable to you our friends and connections among whom I am proud to say are some of the first rank will I am sure do their  possible  to second our poor endeavours  Mrs Clev  Your kindness madam merits my warmest return of gratitude The endearing attentions with which you honour me will tend to soothe the terrors of a mind anxious for the safety  of the dear objects on which all its future happiness depends  Leon  With what sincere joy madam I consider how short will be the continuance of your apprehensions and how complete the happiness you will so soon possess  Mrs Clev  Heaven grant it I have passed many a tedious year with no other solace than the hope of what now appears so near me Fifteen years' absence from the husband of my affections and from my dear child has been a period you may well conceive barren of comfortand even now I have much to dreada long and dangerous voyageBut I will hope the best and not wrong Providence by doubting its goodness  Enter  OAKWORTH  Oakw  I am out of breathquite out of breathAnd I am almost out of my witsshe is arrived she is arrived  Mrs Clev  My daughter  Oakw  YesI have seen her I have seen her  Mrs

old gentleman You can't think how glad he was to see me he kissed me as fondly as if I had been his own daughter  Mrs Clev  He is one my Julia who has made my comfort for these fifteen years the chief business of his life  Jul  What has he been so kind to my dear mother Oh then I must kiss him again  runs and kisses him  Oakw  I am too happyI am too happy  Jul  Tho' my new friends are so kind to me

relations because she would not part from me therefore I must love her better than ever and every body that loves me must love Gangica  Mrs Clev  Her affection for my dear child makes her certain of my love But I feel exhausted with excess of joy We should not lament that there are few incidents in life which waken such extreme delight for were they frequent how shortly would our weak frames

GANGICA  Manent  LEONARD  Old  VISORLY  and  OAKWORTH  Oakw  looking after them then wiping his eyes  I can't tell how it isI be no whimperer gentlemen but somehow my eyes do nothing but moisten today  Old Vis  I feel the tear of sensibility bedew  my  cheek Ah Leonard my boy if you can but get her  aside to Leonard  Leon  Hush sir hush  to Oakworth  Wha delight sir you must feel at the happiness of this family to whom you have shewn so much attachment What gratitude do they not owe you  Oakw  Gratitude to me That is a great mistake of yours and it behoves me to set you right Mrs Cleveland's father saved me once from ruinme and my family from beggary and I think he must have but a bad notion of the value of a kindness done him who if he could live long enough would not strive to repay it down to the fiftieth generation  Leon  What a noble heart  Oakw  Noble heart Psha psha sure the world is not so bad that a man need be praised for not being a monster  Leon  I am proud of the happiness of being known to you  Old Vis  And so am I most sincerely  Oakw  Why to be sure a mighty matter to be proud of gentlemen being known to an old stupid country bumpkin Surely you be jeering a bodybut if you be I can't find in my heart to be angry for as long as you are so good and so kind to the dear creatures I love you may flout and jeer at me as much as you please  Leon  You mistake us extremely  it is the farthest from our thoughts to be deficient in any particle of respect  Old Vis  Oh dear we never dreamed of such a thing  Oakw  Well I suppose I shall be able in time to understand your London speechifying but in truth your fine civil sayings are so like making  game that for a little while I shall be deucedly puzzled  Leon  You never can be at a loss for our meaning

novelty no pleasure for you  Jul  Yes 'tis novelty makes me domestic a dear novelty the novelty of a mother Now I have gained her sweet society should I resign it for frivolous amusements I can command at all times  Car  Well you are a dear good girl  Jul  But where are you going this evening  Car  That I cannot tell without referring to my engagement list but as near as I can guess to about a dozen assemblies the opera a concert and a masqued ball  Jul  My dear Caroline you'll be fatigued to death  Car  Oh no I am never weary with pleasure  Jul  And do you often make these laborious exertions for your amusement  Car  Oh yes all through the seasonAnd I don't think that half long enough  Jul  Well to be equal to such efforts a woman of fashion must be endued with more strength than any creature in the universe  Car  To be sure Your elephant is nothing to  her for groveling instinct restrains him from exceeding the paltry limits of mere corporeal exertion but the elevated spirits and glowing imagination of a woman of fashion make her a being all essenceShe is like the wind light fleet and invincible  Jul  And is she not sometimes like the wind in my native country which now breathes all gentleness yet in a few hours will whirl a whole fortune to destruction  Car  Why yes I am afraid there have been instances of the tornado kind I really don't know whether many men may not be better pleased with your quiet stayathome notions than with more dash and spirit but perhaps you never yet examined your inclinations with an eye to how a husband would approve them Ah Julia you blush my dear I believe this scrutiny has not been unattended to  Jul  How you talk  Car  Yes I  talk  and you  think  but both on the same subject My dear girl have I yet claim enough on your confidence to ask if the being I allude to has stolen into your dreams and been admitted into your waking reveries in the form of a beautiful accomplished youth whose exact likeness you have never yet realized or have you already assigned him "A local habitation and a name"  Jul  Heigho  Car  Oh then I lay my life Mr Heigho has a name and place of abode Am I not right  Jul  Yes  Car  And in what quarter of the globe does he exist  Jul  Nay where shou'd he I have not been  long enough in this country to have found him here I must have met him before  Jul  aside  So my poor brother your chance is gone What is his name  Jul  Henry Melville  Car  And you expect him here no doubt  Jul  Oh yes in the same vessel with my father  Car  And does he know your partiality  Jul  Yes and I know his for me and my father approves  Car  Oh you happy girl Now the man I love neither knows my partiality for him nor do I know whether he cares at all for meAnd if we did know that we cared for each other I am sure my father would let us care on till both our hearts broke before he would give his consent  Jul  Why so  Car  Because the poor dear fellow has lost all his fortune but luckily my father's consent is not essential as I have a fortune independent of him  Jul  Then you are not in a very hopeless state  Car  Oh yes I am for my lover my love I should say lost all selfimportance with his fortune and I very much fear I shall never be able to make him comprehend that a young woman with a good estate is ready to let him be master of it  Jul  How strange  Car  Hints won't doAnd if I could bring myself to say to him plainly "Dear Sir I adore you" he would only think I was making a jest of him  Enter a  Servant  Serv  Mr Drooply to wait on you Ma'am  Exit  to  Caroline  Car  Lord how my

favourably received now remember I have promised not to be angry you would overcome your diffidence and reveal it  Dro  I assure you that  Car  A moment's patience prayAt last by great entreaty I

Really What an old acquaintance  Shar  A very old one siryou knew him long before I did  Oakw  Bless my soul and pray sir what is your name  Shar  I am called Sharpset sir  Oakw  Then you must be mistaken sirI have no acquaintance of that name  Shar  My dear sir that is not the family name that is not my father's name  Oakw  Well what is your father's name  Shar  The very reason sir which made me adopt another name still prevents me from just at present avowing my real one but depend upon it you shall know sir  Oakw  Well sir whenever it is proper to tell me I shall be glad to know  going

of Mr Visorly There I shall learn my Julia's residence This is but a sorry garb for a lover to seek his mistress in but if I know my Julia's heart her joy at finding me preserved from death will make her little heed or scarcely see the poorness of my raiment Her father's safety though I little doubt it I long to be assured of Now then to be resolved on that important point and meet my Julia  Exit

such dangerBut where is my father  Henry  Have you not seen him yet  Julia  Oh no notell me does he live  Henry  I hope so Julia  Julia  Oh is it only hope  Henry  Be comfortedhe  may  be safe he surely  must  Soon as our vessel bulged on the rock and the impetuous torrent rushed at the dreadful chasm to o'erwhelm us the boats were instantly hauled  out and in a moment throng'd In one least crowded was your father he called to me and earnestly conjured me to come into itAs I was going to comply I saw a poor old man kneeling to heaven to save him from the fate his feeble age denied him to contend against The boat could safely hold but oneI placed him in it seized on a friendly coop and with it trusted to the waves  Julia  My generous Henry But my father  Henry  The sea was very boisterous and often washed over me yet at intervals I snatched a short view and still saw his boat riding in safety At length the bursting billows showering so frequently their torrents on me deluged my senses When I recovered them I found myself in a small vessel whose crew had humanely rescued me from death  Julia  Oh my poor father  Henry  Nay droop not JuliaThis vessel was a sloop of war sailing for the Downs Before I recovered it was under weigh I was therefore forced to remain in it till it gain'd its stationLanded at Deal I could of course hear no tidings of your father whose boat no doubt safely reached the nearest shore His not being yet arrived argues nothing against his safety  Julia  But would he not have written to acquaint us with itNews of the wreck could reach us but no intelligence from himNo he is gone My father is gone for ever  Henry  My Julia's grief distracts meStill let me hope 'tis without cause but as no moment should be lost to prove it groundless I will this instant fly to know the truth▪ Farewell my Julia When next we meet I trust all grief will vanish  Exeunt severally  ACT IV  SCENE IVISORLY'S  House  Enter  LEONARD  and  SHARPSET  Leon  Where

Leon  To bear her away Once in my possession all may go smoothly at her age nay at any age a transfer of affection is no uncommon incident  Shar  But the difficultySee how she is surrounded  Leon  Difficulty every difficulty yields to the enterprising Her lover is gone like a true hero of romance to conjure up the dead 'Tis easy to get the rest out of the wayFirst I'll remove the main obstacle her rustic protector  Shar  Remove him how do you mean remove him  Leon  We must lack invention indeed not to effect thatBy an hundred stratagems we can keep him out of the way long enough to answer my purpose  Shar  But I have a trifling objection to his being put to the slightest inconvenience  Leon  Objection what  Shar  He only happens to be my father  Leon  What do you say your father  Shar  My father  Leon  You astonish me Well well this may turn to account Then you may have influence to bring him over to my interest  Shar  Not I nor all the world would be able to influence him to a dishonest actionBeside friend Leonard to let you into a secret I neither like your scheme nor wish to forward it After a long absence I have had the happiness to meet my father and when I behold in him what a glow of youth an honest heart infuses into an aged face I am determined to abandon my roguery and try to make the rosy honours of honesty hereditary  Leon  You mean then to defeat my purposes  Shar  I certainly mean not to aid them  Leon  But am I to expect your opposition  Shar  I hope Leonard your own reflections will render that needless Could you have fairly gained the girl's affections I should have rejoiced at your success and thought the society of an amiable woman the likeliest school for forming an honest man but forceto use force against a lovely helpless female none but a devil could inspire the thought and none but devils could be found to execute it  Leon  Bravo one might judge by your energy that you were a newmade proselyte Apostates are always the maddest enthusiastsBut fool do you think I am to be preached out of my intentions  Shar  And do you think I am to be bullied out of mine  Leon  Well sir take your course but be cautious that you do not thwart meDare not to breathe a word of my designs unless your devotion to your new tenets is warm enough to make you welcome a prison in their defence Mark me a prison You may remember there are certain bonds of yours in my possession that give me as entire a power over your person as tho' you were my purchased slave Remember this and act accordingly  Exit  Shar  How my blood boils at the villain too

friendship to a scoundrel  Leon  Very true one is often mistaken  Dro  Yes miserably  Leon  But when we come to the knowledge of a friend's real worth  Dro  It sometimes teaches us to consider him a friend no longer  Leon  Your gloom I find has taken the general course and led you to misanthropy When men have been unfortunate they generally grow unjust  Dro  Yes and for that there is some excuseBut when men are unjust and fortunate too what black souls they must have  Leon  Very true but have you had experience of such  Dro  Havn't I lost a fortune  Leon  Yesby play not knavery  Dro  Why play and knavery are so much connected that I can't separate them for the soul of me  Leon  You appear to have suspicions  Dro  No no  suspicions  at all  Leon  You surely talk as if you had

now in possession of the girl and her fortune you might probably not be condemning the means by which I accomplished it  Old Vis  Yes I shouldI should condemn such means  Oh fie against her will  Leon  Seemingly sir only seeminglyThe man who would deal successfully with the sex must often force them to follow their own inclinations  Old Vis  I don't know that but I have found that the man who would deal quietly with the se  is always forced to let them follow their own inclinations  Leon  It was a desperate effort but the only chance left for obtaining her That foiled she is lost most certainly perhaps her fortune too  Old Vis  Perhaps why to be sure it is  If she is lost her fortune must be lostYou can't contrive to marry the fortune without marrying the girl can you  Leon  No sir  but  with your aid the fortune may be ours without the incumbrance  Old Vis  The fortune oursEh how  Leon  Had Cleveland died unmarried you were his heir  Old Vis  Yeswhat of that  Leon  Are we sure he did not die unmarried  Old Vis  We should be pretty sure I think when he has left a wife and child behind to convince us  Leon  Is she his wife Can she prove herself such  Old Vis  Eh  Leon  By his own account the marriage was a private one a private marriage in the EastIndies Reflect first on the probability of its being no marriage and next consider the difficulty of proving it if it were one  Old Vis  Yes yes very true But  you surely do not doubt the marriage therefore to claim a property because perhaps legal proof can't be obtained  Leon  Is you think not strictly within the pale of moral rectitude  Old Vis  I can't say but I am of that opinion  Leon  Oh sir despise all abstract refinement and be assured that you fulfil every moral obligation when your conduct is sanctioned by the laws of your country  Old Vis  There is something in that but yet justice you know can only be guided by appearances and one's conscience will not always acquiesce  Leon  My dear sir when your conscience opposes a legal decree you should consider it as acting contumaciously and that it ought to be silenced for contempt of the court  Old Vis  If I could be satisfied that they were really not married  Leon  There is strong presumption Would Cleveland's father think you have endeavoured to dissolve the sacred ties of marriage Have insisted  on his son's abruptly dismissinga wife No no sirdepend on it the father anxious for his son's respectability demanded only his parting with a favourite mistress  Old Vis  Very likelyvery likelyI always said you had the way of placing things in a right point of view  Oh my scruples are goneshould I be robbed of my right by a mistress and a  Leon  Certainly not sir  Now then you are convinced of the rectitude of your cause let me urge a strong motive for

fairly discharged  Oakw  Impudent scoundrel  Mas of Hot  Sir I shall teach you to use better language to a man in his own house  Enter a  Gentleman  followed by a  Waiter  Gent  Heyday nothing but bustle and uproar  Waiter  I hope you are not hurt sir  Gent  Not at all but no thanks for that to the careless dog of a postilion who overturned me I have been quarrelling with him outside of the house and I find you are at the same employment within Get me a coach directly  To the  Waiter  Waiter  Yes sir  Exit  Gent  Well what is the matter here  Oakw  Only this worthy master of the house insulting his customers  Gent  That is an odd way of recommending himself  Oakw  To  Landlord  Away with you and be careful that you let none of your insolence break out before the ladies or I'll be the death of you you dog  Exit  Master of the Hotel  Gent  Sir give me leave to ask that is if there be no offence in the question are the ladies you mention under any pecuniary embarrassment for it would be a sad thing to have ladies liable to the rudeness of this unfeeling fellow  Oakw  No sir thank heaven Even my poor pocket could satisfy his paltry demands No notho' they are unfortunate they are not in the power of such a pitiful scoundrel as that  Gent  I am glad of it but still you say they are unfortunate  Oakw  Yes misery be the lot of the villians who made them so  Gent  Who are those villians  Oakw  Their own relations  Gent  Heav'ns what depravity But can't this villiany be in any way redressed  Oakw  Only one way if at all and there the remedy would be as bad as the disease  Gent  What is the remedy  Oakw  Going to law  Gent  If law can give the remedy redress is certain in this country the way to justice is not through blind mazes and crooked pathsNo 'tis a public road open to all obvious to all  Oakw  That is very true but like other public  roads you would get on a very little way without money to pay the tolls  Gent  The warm interest you take in the cause of your friends convinces me that they are worthy of it I have a fortune an ample fortune and I can no way employ it so satisfactorily as in rescuing the virtuous from the machinations of villainy  Oakw  Sir sir let me rightly understand you I beg your pardon but do you indeed mean to employ your fortune to relieve the distress of strangers utter strangers to you  Gent  Certainly or how should I relieve distress at all for all that belong to me thank heaven are above the power of fortune's malice  Oakw  Bless you bless you the widow's blessingthe orphan's  Gent  Nay nay good old man I were blest enough for all that I can do in seeing how happy I have made you But a widowan orphan say you Those are sacred names The husband gone who is protector to the widowHeavenThe parent lost who is the orphan's father Heaven The man then who will not assert their rights is not uncharitable only for he is impiousGood man why do you tremble thus  Oakw  I am oldI feel now I am an old man and tho' my nerves I think would bear me stoutly up under adversity yet somehow this sudden turn of good fortune has  shook  me has  shook  me a good deal  Gent  Compose yourselfthen tell the ladies that I shall see them very soon for I now must go  Oakw  Don't go don't go yet Let them hear sir from your own lips your goodness  Gent  My business hence is nothing trivial and only a case of misfortune could have detained me  here an instant therefore assure your friendsBut why not debar myself a few moments longer of my own gratification to convince them of my certain protection  aside  my good old friend tell the ladies I wait to see them  Exit  OAKWORTH  Ay ay 'twill make but a few minutes difference and the dear good creatures I so long to behold will forgive me when I tell them that the cause of my delay was to dry the tear of affliction  Enter Mrs  CLEVELAND  led in by  OAKWORTH JULIA  following with  HENRY  Mrs Clev  Sir your goodness  Jul  My father  Clev  My wife my

things carefully into a chamber and be sure take care of that little box  Waiter  Yes sir  Exit  Dro  And here we are my dearest Caroline with the parson's blessing upon us I hardly durst raise my hopes to this happiness even before your worthy brother contrived to make me an estate out of pocket but my generous girl when I reflect that you take a beggar to your arms  Car  Nay nay I am only doing an act of common honesty in paying the debts of my family and I am to consider you a very gentle creditor  to be satisfied with less than a third of your demand and to take charge of me into the bargain  Dro  My dearest girl  Car  But amidst our happiness let us not forget the melancholy situation of the dear ClevelandsLet us instantly try to see them  Dro  Here comes the little Gentoo full of glee Oh this looks well  Enter  GANGICA  Car  Gangica  Gan  Ah you here Oh I glad of datI so happy  Car  What has happened to make you so  Gan  pointing to her heart  Dis too full of joy to let me

punishment  Mrs Clev  It will be ample be assured but do not you wrest vengeance from that Power who best knows how to deal it that Power which never withholds its succour from the innocent nor le  s the guilty 'scape its awful indignation  Julia  But say my father by what miracle are you restored to us  Clev  Henry no doubt has told you that he saw me in the boat which his humanity declined a place inWe laboured for the nearest shore▪  but ound that an attempt to land would whelm us in the raging surfthus were we compelled to trust our little skiff to the wide ocean and for many hours were driven at random by its furyAt length we gained the land but far from the coast on which we left our wreck  Julia  But  why did you not the instant that you landed acquaint us with your safety  Clev  Alas I had lost the power of doing so Enfeebled by fatigue when I reached the shore I scarce had sense or motion a fever followed from which reason and health returned togetherSo on the instant I set out to be myself the herald of my safety  Henry  I sought you on the coast near Portland  Clev  Well might you hear no tidings of me for we made our landing at the Isle of Wight to the humanity of whose inhabitants myself and poor companions owe our lives Think you those wretches the Visorlys will venture to you  Mrs Clev  Convinced that you are no longer living I have no doubt but the instructions we have given to Oakworth to communicate will bring them here  Clev  The young one has never seen me and Old Visorly not since I was quite a child so it is impossible I should be known  Mrs Clev  But promise to preserve your temper  Clev  Depend on me  Oakw  without  This way  Mrs Clev  I hear Oakworth's voice We will retire  Exeunt Mrs  CLEVELAND JULIA  and  HENRY  Enter  OAKWORTH

understand that you have volunteered to defend the cause of Mrs Cleveland Are we rightly informed sir  Clev  You are  Leon  I thought the days of chivalry were over  Clev  So did I but since monsters still exist'tis fit that they revive again  Leon  You have begun your career of enterprize most illustrious knight with rather a hopeless adventure  Clev  It may not be found so  Leon  You seem an intelligent man A little conversation will I have no doubt bring us to the same opinion and all errors will be rectified before we part  Clev  You need not doubt it sir  Old Vis  Now my boy Leonard will talk him over in a grand stile Oh he is a blessing to my old age  aside  Leon  This woman has the power of influencing persons very much in her favour  Clev  Innocence always has that power  Leon  Innocence  Sir sir you are duped deceived  Clev  How sir  Leon  Nay sir if you fly off in this way you are not the man of sense I take you for  Clev  Well sir go on  Leon  You are led to believe this lady to have been Mr Cleveland's wife  Clev  Yes sir I am  Leon  Grossly imposed on We have the most convincing reasons to believe the contrary  Clev  Indeed  Leon  Sir sir what do you think of us Should we be so lost to the common feelings of human nature as to proceed as we have done but upon just ground  Old Vis  Oh I assure you sir before I consented Leonard thoroughly convinced me  Clev  He did  Leon  Yes and you shall be convinced Oh sir let me appeal to your respectability You are a man who must I am certain rank high in the world's estimation How would that be injured by your present interference How would the world despise abhor the man who could support the claims of mere pretenders against a rightful heir  pointing to  Old Visorly  Clev  How the world will despise will abhor such a wretch will very soon be known  Leon  You perhaps are not aware that she has no proofs of her marriage  Clev  Proofs may be found  Leon  In India you think Will you go thither for them  Clev  I have been  Leon  What  Clev  I have been  Leon  You knew Cleveland perhaps  Clev  Yes  Leon  Do you know then of his marriage  Clev  I was present at it  Leon  You surprize me  Clev  Will this satisfy you  Leon  A witness may be suborned The law  will scarcely be content with one person's testimony  Clev  With mine it clearly will  Leon  You may be mistaken sir It will be rash to risk it I will make an offer a handsome offerWe will resign our claim to half the fortune manage the business with the ladies as you please you may depend on our secresy We tender to  you  mind to  yourself  half the fortune  Clev  It is a handsome offer  Old Vis  Very indeed may be you think a third would be enough  Clev  No no far from it for though the bribe sounds handsomely it would be want of policy in me to take it  Leon  How  Clev  For this plain reason that tho' I admit these ladies to be Cleveland's wife and daughter still Cleveland's fortune is the right of  Leon  Whom  Clev  Me  Leon  You by what title  Clev  The clearest in the worldfounded on the simple principle that while a man can prove himself alive his heirs are not allowed to take possession of his property  Leon  Alive  Clev  Why gentlemen you are very hard to be convinced Surely you should admit a man alive when he is able himself to tell you so  Leon  Confusion  Old Vis  Oh dear oh dear oh dear  Clev  And how do you now feel yourselves my very worthy cousins  Goes to the door  Come come in and thank your kinsmen for all their kindness  Enter Mrs  CLEVELAND  and  JULIA  Old Vis  Oh Leonard Leonard did I ever think you would have brought me into such disgrace  Clev  Sensible rebuke of age to youth You should have led your son into the path of honesty not been seduced by him into the road of villainy  Old Vis  I'll go home and if I continue in my present mind I think it very likely I shall hang myself before tomorrow morning Oh Leonard Leonard  Exit  Clev  With your company sir  to Leonard  I cannot dispense till I receive assurance that my property remitted to you is vested as I directed  Enter  DROOPLY CAROLINE HENRY  and  OAKWORTH  Dro  My worthy brother give me joy  Leon  Your brother  Car  Even so sir  Leon  You are well paired I wish you all the happiness that mutual poverty can give you  Car  Poverty nay we need not starve My estate is surely sufficient to prevent that  Leon  Your estate You must first persuade me to resign the writings of it  Car  Thank you dear brother but you happen to forget you have already done that  Leon  I howwhen  Car  By your direction I brought the box to town with me which you said contained the writings  Leon  Yesaythat boxhey let me see itI have got the key of it  Dro  The key my dear fellow Do you think  I do things so cursed mechanically as to want keys A man just come into possession of an estate and not break open the box that contained his claim to it  Leon  What broke open  Dro  Yes with a kitchen poker Lord how alarmed you are Yes I broke it open and found I had killed two birds with one stone for instead of only getting the writings of one estate I found the writings of twoThis lady's and my own  A person enters and converses apart with  CLEVELAND  and then Exit  Leon  Curses fall on me  Dro  That they will fast enough never fear What a shrewd guesser you must be You had the wisdom to foresee that some time or other there would be a junction of the properties and you therefore commodiously packed up the writings together Ah you are a considerate fellow  Clev to Leonard  Sir we need your presence here no longer My property I find is vested as I appointed Now sir depart loaded not with my reproaches not with my malediction for the whole world's contempt and the heaviest curses of the injured would add but a feather's weight to the mountain of remorse which conscious guilt will heap upon thy wretched bosom When I reflect on the severity of suffering conscience can inflict I could almost forget my injuries and pity thee  Leon  To palliate my guilt I do not seekyet in justice let me declare the erroneous judgment of the world made me a villian I beheld the eye of observance and respect ever directed to the wealthy were he fool or knave no matter  While all that is truly amiable or great in genius or in virtue when linked with poverty was heeded with the stare of disavowal or the scowl of contempt To be a golden idol for the world's worship was my aim I have lost my fortune character and happiness in the attempt and now must meet in penury mankind's abhorrence and feel too I deserve it  Exit  Mrs Clev  to Caroline  I grieve to think how much you must be afflicted  Car  I am indeed for with all his unworthiness I cannot forget he is my brother  Clev  Such remembrance honours you for never should the principles of justice absorb the feelings of nature  Enter  SHARPSET  and  GANGICA  Oakw  Ah my good friend you at liberty  Shar  Yes sir I found bail  Oakw  I am very glad to see you  Mrs Clev  Sir I shall ever feel myself your debtor  Shar  Oh Madam  Oakw  I know a way to repay him Madam  Mrs Clev  How  Oakw  By making him rightful possessor of the treasure he holds in his hand  Jul  Gangica do you consent to  Gan  I do all as you please ma'am  Jul  I am sure it will please me that you make yourself happy  Oakw  Now I have performed my promise you must renew my acquaintance with your father  Shar  You and my father sir have never been asunder  Oakw  Hey What do you mean  Shar  To restore you a truant son sir who till he had atoned as far as lay in his power for his former errors could not hope to be acknowledged by such a father  Oakw  What my own boy turned out an honest man  Shar  Yes sir and who now knowing the precious value of that first of titles will never forfeit it  Oakw  Now then I can say I am completely happy  Mrs Clev  Ever ever may you remain soYou will for benevolence like yours makes the human heart a heaven  Clev  The gratitude I owe to all who have befriended these dear objects of my love I hope to shew by something more than words What a prospect of happiness opens to our view Blest with friends proved such in the trying moments of afflictionwith fortune to command profusely every luxury and I trust with minds to employ it only in pursuit of onethe luxury of doing good  FINIS  EPILOGUE  WRITTEN BY JOHN TAYLOR ESQ AND SPOKEN BY MRS POPE  WELL tho' our Bard has try'd his utmost art  To shew how riches will pollute the heart  No doubt his labour has been all in vain  And poverty will ne'er one convert gain  How could the man attempt a task so bold  But what forsooth can authors know of gold  An ore that rarely darts on them a beam  Unless perchance in hope's delusive dream  Hope that misleads them thro' life's weary way  And scarcely leaves at last the barren bay  What wean the human heart from love of pelf  A toil too hard for Hercules himself  Nay that great hero as we learn in story  Strove for a little gain as well as glory  Else why attack the dreadful scaly brute  If not to grasp the rich Hesperian fruit  Hence av'rice is a passion not so odd  Since as we find it urg'd a demigod  'Twas also said of yore the female tribe  Are frail as men when tempted by a bribe  And mighty Jove with all his boasted pow'r  Was forc'd to woo amid a golden show'r  Oh wond'rous charm of allpersuasive gold  That fires the timid and subdues the bold  Gold that can give the upstart blockhead fame  And make a fawning world his wit proclaim  That lends deformity resistless grace  O'erthrows the mighty and exalts the base  Great substitute for learning genius worth  Despotic sovereign of adoring earth  But let me check the rash injurious thought  For in this court no verdict can be bought  Here merit safely may assert her plea  While candour regulates the mild decree  And by that candour one who oft has try'd  Its gen'rous force his fate must now abide  In hopes one error more will pardon find  Since to his others you've so long been kind  NEW PUBLICATIONS PRINTED FOR T N LONGMAN and O REES No PaternosterRow  THE LIFE of CATHARINE II EMPRESS of RUSSIA The Third Edition with considerable Improvements In Three
