 THE DUELLIST  PRICE ONE SHILLING AND SIXPENCE  THE DUELLIST A COMEDY  AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENT GARDEN  WRITTEN BY W KENRICK LL D  LONDON PRINTED FOR T EVANS NEAR YORK BUILDINGS IN THE STRAND  PREFACE  Extract from the PUBLIC ADVERTISER of Monday November  ON Saturday last a new comedy called the Duellist was performed for the first time at CoventGarden Theatre Previous to the curtain being drawn up the following written handbill was dispersed about the house  Mr Macklin has been pursued by a malicious party to such a pitch of rancour that at last they have succeeded so far in their cursed designs as to get him discharged this Theatre and thereby have deprived him of the means of a livelihood Therefore if the Public have any spirit they will not suffer the new play to begin till Mr Colman promises that Mr Macklin shall be engaged again  This handbill found its way into the GreenRoom and had a very visible effect on the performers as was plainly evident from their confusion The piece was received with great marks of approbation and given out again for Monday which was attended with some hissing but that was greatly overpowered by the general applause of the audience The overture to  Thomas and Sally  being attended to with silence the greatest part of the Author's Friends quitted the Theatre which being taken advantage  of by a party in the gallery a riot ensued and the entertainment was not suffered to go on till another play was given out for Monday  To the above concise relation of the circumstances attending the representation of the following Comedy as it is given by one of the most respectable of our diurnal historians the Author of the Duellist makes no exception or addition He would be wanting however in that respect which he has ever professed and shewn for the public opinion did he not endeavour to obviate some objections that have been made to his Piece and to account as well as he is able for the unprecedented severity of its treatment  As to the author's pretensions to merit in this species of writing it is not for him to boast were there cause for boasting Because sensible of the necessity of a dramatic writer's making the theatre the constant scene of his observation he can without mortification admit that an author whose study is the stage bids fairer for success on it than another who engaged at a distance in more scientific researches makes its amusements only his occasional relaxation from severer and more laborious pursuits Not that he is without reason to be flattered with the applause his performance met with in representation though were it otherwise he should not have the vanity to copy after a Corneille who in the preface to his Pertharite which was universally condemned avows boldly that in spite of censure his play was a good one and well written He would have confidence  enough however in imitation of as great a writer of our own country to declare with Dryden that the town "had received with applause as bad and as uncorrect plays from other men" As a writer by profession therefore whose family depends on his industry he conceives it not only prudential in him to convert his amusements to profit but that he has a right to expect the theatres should be as open to receive his productions as those of others It is true he has not found it so and is singularly unlucky in having his pieces performed with impartial applause and then partially banished the stage He is not ashamed to declare he writes plays not from inclination but from expediency the object in his view being not dramatic reputation but theatrical emolument to which while he writes no worse than others which can hardly be though it should not be allowed he writes better he presumes he is equally entitled  To account for his disappointment in the present instance will not be difficult Some just exceptions may be made to the piece itself the scene between the lawyers in the fourth act appeared too long in deference however to the opinion of Mr Colman who thought its effect would depend greatly on the action it was risked and is here printed at length  As to the passage objected to on account of its supposed indelicacy it is entirely omitted The author must do Mr Colman also the justice to say that he constantly excepted against it and had his  more cautious judgement been attended to it would have been omitted in the representation  Another exception has been made to the whole of the representation on account of the confusion I might say distress of some of the performers But if the circumstances that caused it be attended to such performers were so far from being the objects of reprehension for playing ill that it is a wonder they acquitted themselves so well  To Mr Macklin the author has nothing nor ever will have any thing farther to say than that he imputes the ill success of this unfortunate comedy wholly to that performer's resentment against the managers for having discharged him the theatre as it was doubtless their duty to do at the requisition of the the majority of an audience That illsuccess indeed has been imputed to causes which to admit would be to cast an injurious reflection on persons who the author is well persuaded by no means deserve it  It has been said that the gentlemen of the law took offence at the liberties taken with their profession and practice in the characters and dialogue of Witmore and Nonplus They must have too much knowledge and good sense however to be seriously offended at what was designed as a mere laugh on the stage or a satire on what the best of them regret as much as their clients without having it in their power to remedy it  A club of booksellers and a crew of authors are said to have formed a formidable phalanx of opposition The writer doubts not the good intentions of both he has endeavoured to serve the cause of literature too much to have the good will of those who are labouring by every possible means to ruin it What injury either party might do him in the theatre the author knows not but the scribblers have shewn so little discretion in the zeal to abuse him from the press that he gives them hearty thanks for the service they have undesignedly done him  With respect to Individuals it has been mistakenly or perhaps maliciously propagated that the piece was calculated to ridicule persons or characters for whom the author has either the greatest respect or to whom he is an entire stranger They who read Mr Fielding's Amelia will see from what source the author has drawn some of the principal characters and incidents As the rest of the piece is original the candid must also admit that he has made no greater use of that writer than dramatic authors have ever been allowed to do with novelists from the practice of Shakespear to that of Mr Colman  It has been suggested that Mr Garrick had privately planted a party in the house to oppose the performance This the author cannot believe as having long since declared himself that gentleman's open and avowed enemy he cannot after  what has publickly passed between them think so meanly even of Mr Garrick as to suppose he would act otherwise than as an enemy equally open and avowed  It has even been said that the friends of a certain dramatist whose name the author forbears to mention as it is disgusting to the remembrance of his friends were powerful in the opposition On this head he will only give a little anecdote as it was related to him by an auditor who sat in the Boxes  "During the tumult in the theatre about the repetition of the Duellist a Lady who asked a thing that had the appearance of a gentleman what was the reason of it was answered that "the  Man  meaning the author was obnoxious and therefore his piece must be condemned" "Yes madam" added a gentleman who sat by "There are a multitude of animals in this town to whom the  spirit  of a MAN is as  obnoxious  as the  person  of a WOMAN"May the author of the Duellist be ever obnoxious to such Critics  Lastly it has been urged that the Author had not friends enough in the house to support the piece If by this is meant that the piece had not merit enough to make itself friends it is false as appears from the abovecited relation While its friends remained in the house it was applauded by a great majority but when a considerable number of these went away and their places were supplied by riotous partizans  who could not before get into the house and had not seen it it is no wonder that both the piece and the author should fatally feel the want of friends  If this want on the other hand be imputed to the Author's neglect of introducing people into the theatre to influence the judgment of the impartial part of the audience in his favour he takes a pride in having ever paid in this respect a proper deference to the Public whom he should think he insulted had he acted otherwise and made  personal interest  to support his pretensions to  literary merit  Too proud to beg too modest to demand  By merit only would he fall or stand  Nor enmity nor friendship interfering  He only asks a fair and candid hearing  Prol to the Widow'd Wife  This indeed is cruelly denied him by the interruption of his play but he hopes will not be so on a future occasion the Author having another piece accepted at the same theatre the parts of which being already written out and the whole ready for rehearsal he doubts not the Manager will give him an early opportunity of repairing the loss attending his present disappointment Indeed he still places so much confidence on the justice and generosity of the Public as to slatter himself he shall not ultimately suffer by trusting without party or cabal to the candour and impartiality of his Auditors  PROLOGUE  Written by the AUTHOR  And spoken by Mr SMITH  DEAF to the bar the pulpit and the throne  And aw'd if aw'd by ridicule alone  The Daring Duellist in captious pride  Hath long his friend his king his God defied  Thrice happy we if laughter from the stage  Should cure this frantic folly in the age  Happy the father sister mother wife  Who prize a son's a brother's husband's life  Should we dethrone the tyrant whose caprice  So oft endangers and destroys their peace  Whose fell despotic sway doth ev'n enslave  The great the good the generous and the brave  Nay arrant cowards forc'd into a fray  Now fight because they fearto run away  Our modish heroes it is true may bluster  Take heart of grace and all their spirits muster  This peaceful reformation to oppose  And take  in talk  our author by the nose  But when the comic muse true humour fires  And zeal the poignant fatirist inspires  Against absurdity to set his wit  And folly's mark altho' in mirth to hit  There lies more peril in his pointed words  Than lies alack in twenty of their swords  Encouraged hence the poet of to night  Against these angry boys hath dar'd to write  For by the way it is on you he reckons  Nature's own cause espousing as his seconds  On this presumption doth he take the field  Hoping to make the stoutest blusterer yield  If silent they who neither love nor fear him  Consent to sit and patiently will hear him  If they do this he doubts not to disperse  Their present prejudice for  carte  and  tierce    Their pointless swords to parry with his pen  And pistolproof put down these mighty men  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  General Gantlet  Mr Woodward  Captain Boothby  Mr Smith  Sir Solomon Bauble  Mr Shuter  Counsellor Witmore  Mr Lewis  Lord Lovemore

Temple  Mr WITMORE  and  Capt BOOTHBY  WIT  Really George your situation is so critical that I am not lawyer enough to advise you Sir Solomon your fatherinlaw still so inflexible say you  BOOTH  As positiveness and parsimony can make him It is not above two years since I married and notwithstanding every proper submission on my part the earnest and repeated solicitations of his daughter and the warmest intercessions of our friends he still seems inexorable as ever  WIT  That's strange Time generally softens resentments of this kind But the love of money and an habitual passion for artificial trifles extinguish the sparks of natural affection As I have acquired however some credit with him I will try when he comes to town how far my influence extends And yet Boothby this may be carrying my friendship for you too far  BOOTH  Why so  WIT  You know he has a niece who came over some time since from India to finish her education  BOOTH  I am told he has adopted her for his daughter and in her favour it is supposed will disinherit my wife  WIT  In which case if I should become her husband  BOOTH  You  WIT  I Why not if the lady will have me  BOOTH  And have you any serious thoughts of Emilia  WIT  Why really I do think seriously of her sometimes The month I spent during the last vacation at Sir Solomon's country seat gave me an opportunity of seeing a number of good qualities in her She is young it is true but that's a fault one may easily put up with in a woman  BOOTH  Nay I know little of herSir Solomon and his lady have strictly prohibited her having any intercourse with Mrs Boothby  WIT  To reconcile you therefore to them now will be at least a disinterested proof of my regard for you George  BOOTH  It will so and yet no greater than I expect from it Your generosity of disposition Witmore  WIT  Nay no compliments between friendsOn what terms are you with your own relation With Lord Lovemore and his brotherinlaw General Gantlet  BOOTH  On the best if I may depend on their professions His Lordship is now exerting his interest to procure me a regiment and as he tells me with confidence of success  WIT  I am glad of itYour promotion may have a good effect on Sir Solomon  BOOTH  In the mean time however the pay of a Captain of foot Witmore is so disproportioned to the way of living in this gay town  WIT  That you cannot indulge in the pleasures of it  BOOTH  Nay hardly subsist very creditably and pay the court that is necessary to preferment  WIT  What think you of my laying open your circumstances to the General He is my client and I know you are down for something handsome in his will  BOOTH  Yes but I am afraid he'll not be prevailed on to part with any thing while he lives  WIT  Well you must comfort yourself then by reflecting that cannot be long He is so fond of duelling that some antagonist or other will soon kill him or he will come to be hanged for killing his antagonist He narrowly escaped the last time he killed his man as he calls it and yet he's as captious and quarrelsome as ever  BOOTH  He is indeed unaccountably exceptious But here he comes  Enter  General GANTLET  GAN  Well Barrister how is it What George Boothby By the lord my boy I am heartily glad to see thee  BOOTH  I thank you General I hope I have the pleasure of seeing you well today  GAN  Never better my dear boy I have just had the superlative satisfaction

tells me there is no danger  BOOTH  I am glad to hear that  WIT  And pray General what was the cause of quarrel How did your antagonist offend you  GAN  Me Barrister He did not offend me Give me thy hand Boothby I have done thee an injury which nothing but the height of friendship in me can excuse and the most exalted sublimity of it in thee forgive  BOOTH  What is all this How can you have so highly injured me General Be how it will I promise you I forgive you with all my heart  GAN  I knew thou wast a goodnatured lad and would overlook it or by the Lord thou shouldst have taken him our thyself  BOOTH  How General Have you been taking up a quarrel of mine It was obliging in you but I could wish  GAN  Oh Sir it's enough I understand you you are perfectly in the right I should have been more punctilious It was impertinent in me to be sure A friend may be sometimes too officious However Sir if you are dissatisfied I am at your service Call me outYou can fightI draw my sword for no man who dares not draw his own  BOOTH  Nay but understand me General If you have taken up any cause of mine I am so far from resenting it as an injury that I think myself obliged to you You know I am as tenacious of the punctilio as yourself and would never be so rude as to take up the cause of a stranger but among friends it is quite another thing  GAN  Right boy When I commanded in Ireland my doublet was pinked like the flounces of a fine lady's silk petticoat and all in the cause of my friends The man who would not be run through the body for his friend ought to be kicked out of the world for a scoundrel  BOOTH  An heroic sentiment General But who was your antagonist I hope for your sake he's really out of danger  GAN  Nay the rascal himself I believe is hardly worth the care of the surgeon I should have wiped my contaminated  sword and left him to his fate but that it would have been too great an honour for him to die by the hands of a gentlemen  WIT  And yet General I am afraid your magnanimity will one day or other betray you into the doing some rascal or other that honour  GAN  Well Sir and what then Would you insinuate that a gentleman has not a right to do himself justice by putting to death a scoundrel  WIT  By the laws General  GAN  By the laws of honour Sir  WIT  Yes Sir and by the laws of the land too if he have a mind to be hanged for it A man may break all the laws in the statute book if he be disposed to pay the penalties  GAN  How Sir shall not I annihilate a rascal Do the laws of England afford protection to scoundrels  WIT  To a great number noble General and so do the laws of honour too by which the scoundrel has as often the advantage of the man of honour as the man of honour of the scoundrel Let us suppose General that your antagonist's skill or agility had been greater than yours would that have conferred probity on him or reflected infamy on you  GAN  Infamy on me Sir  WIT  Excuse me General I speak only by way of hypothesis  GAN  Hypothesis Sir Rot your hypothesis Sir  takes Boothby aside  Boothby have you seen the peer today  BOOTH  Lord Lovemore No Sir  GAN  Then you don't know how his affair has ended  BOOTH  What affair General  GAN  With the fellow that affronted him last night  BOOTH  I heard nothing of it  GAN  Come come along with me then I must know how it ended turning about to Witmore Hypothesis Ha Mr Barrister  WIT  No offence I hope General I think I could put a case in point  GAN  A case in point With the point of honour Sir Offence Sir Yes Sir there is offence Sir Come come along Boothby These lawyers of the Inns of Court know nothing of the laws of honour Hypothesis Ha Mr Barrister Come along Boothby Hypothesis Quotha  Exeunt  GAN  and  BOOTH  WITMORE  solus  Ha ha ha

Insupportable is it not enough my Lord that I have given scope to your licentiousness by winking at your gallantries that you would make me openly countenance  them Do you think me really so blind as not to see your designs on Mrs Boothby  Lord LOVE  Look you Madam while I contribute to your pleasures I expect you will not controul mine  Lady LOVE  My pleasures as you call them my Lord are unexceptionable I have no amusements but what are common to women of quality  Lord LOVE  Nor I any but what are common to men of quality In a word Lady Lovemore we have been too long married to impose any longer on the world and we ought to know the world too well to impose any longer on ourselves  Lady LOVE  In what my Lord  Lord LOVE  In keeping up the appearance of domestic harmony which no longer subsists  Lady LOVE  Appearances govern the world my Lord and it is they impose on themselves who will not enjoy the shadow because they have lost the substance  Lord LOVE  Then you think we once possessed it  Lady LOVE  I thought we married for love my Lord  Lord LOVE  I thought so too but I believe we were both mistaken  Lady LOVE  Why so  Lord LOVE  Because there has been so little lost between us and yet there seems to be none left  Lady LOVE  The want of love my Lord should not banish decency  Lord LOVE  But it should banish jealousy Madam  Lady LOVE  Then your Lordship thinks me jealous and yet you imagine there is as little love left on my side as yours  Lord LOVE  The less the better as there is no satisfying the surmizes of a suspicious woman  Lady LOVE  Indeed my Lord you are mistaken You do it effectually by converting suspicion into certainty I have learned to support the being an object of private neglect but I am not quite so meek as to sit down exposed to public contempt  Lord LOVE  You may avoid it madam by retiring from public notice Our house in Gloucestershire is ready to receive you and if you except to the company I keep in town you may keep what company you please in the country The postcoach shall be ready tomorrow morning unless Mrs Boothby makes one of our party tonight  Lady LOVE  My Lord my Lord I will see my brother Gantlet before I determine to stay or go  Lord LOVE  Your brother Gantlet madam Do you mean to intimidate me with your family bully Let that blusterer interfere and I will immure you in the country for life  Lady LOVE  The country And at this time of year What cruelty Is it possible your Lordship can be in earnest  Lord LOVE  Your Ladyship may put me to the trial if you dislike the alternative I leave you a moment to deliberate on the choice  Exit  Lady LOVEMORE  alone  Barbarous tyrant He knows I doat upon living in town and detest the gloomy solitude of his Gloucestershire dungeon I will sometime or other be revenged on him for this treatment My brother's temper indeed is so violent that unless things are carried to extremity his remedy may be worse than the disease But I will dissemble with this insolent intriguer of mine and if I have art enough defeat the execution of his designs by counteracting him I shall be able to do this the more effectually by staying in town Mrs Boothby is at present I believe a woman of honour and loves her husband whom Lord Lovemore is flattering with favours and feeding with promises in order to effect the seduction of his wife What traitors  are men And mine the most insulting of traitors With what an air of assurance did he in fact confess it  Look you Madam while I contribute to your pleasures I expect you will not controul mine  But if Boothby and his wife are not two errant idiots I will controul your pleasures my fine scheming Lord even while you think I am contributing to them Here Echo Bring me pens ink and paper  Enter  ECHO  ECH  Pens ink and paper my Lady  Lady LOVE  It is plain you heard Mrs Pert  ECH  Heard Mrs Pert my Lady  Lady LOVE  Wilt thou never leave off that odious trick of repeating one's words  ECH  Repeating your words my Lady  Lady LOVE  Canst thou say nothing wench but what I say  ECH  Nothing but what you say my Lady  Lady LOVE  Out of my sight thou incorrigible wretch  ECH  Wretch my Lady  Lady LOVE  Begone I say  ECH  Gone my Lady  Exit  ECHO  Reenter  Lord LOVEMORE  Lord LOVE  Well Madam have you reflected on my proposal Do you chuse to reside in town or in the country in London or Gloucestershire  Lady LOVE  You know my Lord I hate Gloucestershire  Lord LOVE  Well madam to indulge your inclination for company what say you to Somersetshire To Bath  Lady LOVE  Out of the season my Lord I would as willingly go out of the world  Lord LOVE  Well madam you know the conditions of our residence under the same roof in town  Lady LOVE  Why look you my Lord as I know you may plead precedent among a number of our acquaintance if I thought you would pay any tolerable regard to appearances I might compound with you It may be prudent for a neglected wife to seem easy under the indifference of her husband but she must be meek and meanspirited indeed if she can submit to be insulted by his mistress Not that I think you will succeed with Mrs Boothby She is I believe so fond of her husband that I am persuaded I may safely trust her with you  Lord LOVE  Do so then and be satisfied if I keep up appearances as you term it  Exit  Lady LOVE  I will my Lord and hope to fit you too at the keeping up of appearances  Exit  SCENE III  An Apartment at  Sir Solomon Bauble's  Enter  Sir SOLOMON  and  Lady BAUBLE  Lady BAU  Pooh Sir Solomon what a rout is here about an old rusty counter and a roll of cindercoloured parchment I suppose Mrs Brush has flirted them away in dusting the diningroom Mrs Brush  Sir SOL  No no My lady I tell you I have been robbed plundered I have lost two curiosities that would have caused the museum at Baublehall to be admired by all the antiquaries and connoisseurs in Europe An Otho in the highest preservation and a Greek manuscript dug out of the ruins of Herculaneum  Enter

worship knew one of the gentlemen Sir and I  thoft  the other gentlemen was another gentleman and especially as they were both Anticqueerians I  thoft  them next kin to nobody Indeed I  thoft  no harm Sir  Sir SOL  You  thoft  you thoughtless baggage who taught you to think Get you gone about your business  BRUSH  aside  Here's a fuss indeed about their Othurs and anticks Exit  BRUSH  Sir SOL  Dr Birdlime eh Yes yes I knew if ever he came in the way my medals would stick to his fingers But if I do not prosecute the pilsering quack with the utmost severity of the law Egad I'll go to Sir John Fielding and take out a warrant to search his house immediately  Lady BAU  Fiddle faddle Sir Solomon the coppersmith who made that Otho can make another and as for the loss of your manuscript I'll present your museum with my sentimental journey to Margate which Dr Pompous says is worth all the manuscripts of Herculaneum put together But come Sir Solomon we have matters to mind of more importance I have communicated to your niece Emmeline the arrival of  her intended husband Governor Mammon from India and bade her prepare to receive him accordingly  Sir SOL  Well and she was overjoyed at the news Eh  Lady BAU  Quite the reverse  Sir SOL  How  Lady BAU  The family seems doomed Sir Solomon to have all its projects frustrated by the perverseness of undutiful children Your daughter threw herself away on that Captain Boothby a young fellow not worth a groat and here is your niece averse truly to marry governor Mammon a man as rich as a nabob  Sir SOL  And yet you would have forgiven your daughter as you will your niece I suppose  Lady BAU  I forgive them Sir Solomon I would have you to know that I have a spirit as implacable and unforgiving as yourself  Sir SOL  Poh Poh You foolish women are easily prevailed on to do any thing But why  my  daughter and  my  niece Madam Why not  your  daughter and  your  niece No such perverseness runs in the blood of the Baubles They would marry any toy for money  Lady BAU  I thank you husband but vain as you are I did not marry you for love The family of the Trinkets whence I am descended never sacrificed their interest to their passions or indulged indeed any passion but that of interest  Sir SOL  It is much wise that children should not take after their parents  Lady BAU  You a philosopher husband and not know that the commixture of two limpid fluids will sometimes generate opacity Would you have me account for the irregularities of a  lusus naturae  or unravel the tortuosities of a froward imagination  Sir SOL  No No That is a task a little beyond the capacity of a woman  Lady BAU  The capacity of a woman Sir And do you still maintain the preposterous absurdity of superior intellect in man Does not history afford innumerable instances of equal endowments in women What were Semiramis Artemisia Thomyris Zenobia and the no less eminent Arataphila among the ancients  Sir SOL  Zounds What a string have I touched upon Now will she run over the catalogue of all the cunning gypsies and female fortunetellers that have plagued the world from the witch of Endor down to mother Shipton  Lady BAU  What were Catherine de Medicis Lucretia Cornaro Anna Maria Schurman and Madam Dacier among the moderns  Sir SOL  All female furies or petticoated pedants I dare answer for them  Lady BAU  Nay among our contemporaries is not my Lady Betty Comment a second Aristotle Mrs Politic another Tacitus And does not Madam Sweetwort the brewer's wife at Redriff write odes with the pen of a Pindar Does not  Enter

little in her female altitudes this morning What's the matter  SERV  A letter from Governor Mammon Sir His chairmen have set down two chests in the hall a present they say to your worship and my Lady  Sir SOL  A present Eh Are the Chests heavy Thomas  SERV  Very heavy an't please your worship  Sir SOL  The more heavy the more likely to be welcome Thomas A chest of guineas might be too light Give the fellows something to drink and I'll come to you presently  Exit  SERVANT  Lady BAU  returning to the front of the stage  The capacity of women truly  Sir SOL  Prithee my Lady don't let such a trifle disturb you Governor Mammon is arrived in town and has sent you a present this morning to put you in a good humour And I doubt not when I come to talk to my niece she will receive him as she ought to do The Governor I see knows how to recommend himself  Lady BAU  To be sure the superiority of your masculine understanding Sir Solomon must prevail on my niece to do any thing As to the Governor indeed it must be owned his oriental manner of making approaches by presents is a captivating mode of address But let us see what he has sent us the letter I suppose will inform you  Sir SOL  Ay let us see let us see  Putting on his spectacles He reads  Governor Mammon presents his compliments to Sir Solomon Bauble and Lady will take the earliest opportunity of paying them his personal

Governor has sent me  Reads again  And Sir Solomon's of two curiosities he hopes not unworthy a place in the museum of so celebrated a virtuoso the one a manuscript sermon of an Eastern Bramin on the duty of womento bury themselves with their deceased husbands  Lady BAU  Horrid Why the importation of oriental manuscripts should be prohibited with popish massbooks  Sir SOL  Yes wife if they were likely to make as many converts But the Bramins will make no proselytes here Our wanton widows would rather run the risk of killing a second husband than bury themselves with the first  Lady BAU  What foolish women Sir Solomon not to be guided by your wise men of the East  Sir SOL  Ha What's this  reads  The other Sure my spectacles deceive me  pulling off his spectacles and wiping them then

Egyptian Princess I shall be the envy of all the virtuosi the connoscenti the dilettanti in Europe  Lady BAU  The old fool In raptures with an odious mummy How wonderful the superiority of masculine wisdom  Exit  Sir SOL  Nay don't be jealous my lady but I can't contain my transports I must fly to the presence of her highness my Egyptian Princess  Exit  End of ACT the First  ACT II  SCENE I Capt

BOOTH  Your Ladyship is so obliging but indeed I' had a preengagement  Lady LOVE  I will hear of no preengagements You must come and play a pool at quadrille with the ladies while my Lord and the Captain are engaged with the gentlemen at whist  Mrs BOOTH  Mr Boothby madam hath solemnly renounced the game  Lady LOVE  Rash vows Mrs Boothby you know are made to be broke My Lord will overcome his scruples on that score I warrant you so that you can have no excuse  Mrs BOOTH  In that case my Lady I will certainly do myself the pleasure to wait on you  Lady LOVE  Nay you positively must come we cannot do without you You will pardon me my dear but I must excuse myself at twenty other placesNayyou shan't stir My chair is in the hall Adieu my dear Mrs Boothby  Exit ceremoniously Mrs BOOTHBY  alone  How perfectly wellbred and obliging How can Mrs Goodwill think ill of such a woman Really these good people who let lodgings are too apt to speak ill of their betters And yet somehow I don't like the tale she told me about General Gantlet She has seen much of the world and appears to be a discerning kind of woman I know not whether I should altogether slight her hints They were given too with such an air of significance There may be more in this business than she has told me for why should so silly a speech give such offence to the General  Reenter  Mrs GOODWILL  Mrs GOOD  Bless me madam I hope you did not say a word of what I hinted to Lady Lovemore the shortness of her visit alarmed me  Mrs BOOTH  That would have been indiscreet indeed Mrs Goodwill as I am convinced however you may be mistaken in her Ladyship you meant no ill to me But pray was that idle saying all that passed to provoke the General so highly  Mrs GOOD  Nothing more that I heard except that the gentleman added his Lordship chose to procure preferment for his friends abroad that he might occasionally pay a charitable visit to their wives at home  Mrs BOOTH  Then it is plain the reflection could not respect me Captain Boothby is to have a regiment in England and he hath solemnly promised I shall go with him if he be ordered abroad  Mrs GOOD  Yes madam but the promises of a husband sometimes bind as little as those of a lover  Mrs BOOTH  Nay Mrs Goodwill I must hear nothing against my husband  Mrs GOOD  I beg pardon madamI have done  Exit  Mrs BOOTH  I will exact however another promise from Mr Boothby that go where he will I shall accompany him  Exit  SCENE II  An Antichamber in the House of  Governor Mammon  Enter  Sir SOLOMON BAUBLE  and  MAC TOTUM  in the Dress of a Banyan  Sir SOL

you last night at the whist table  Lord LOVE  I took no affront General nor recollect any that was given me  G GAN  No affront Did not your partner tread on your toe the moment you were cut in  Lord LOVE  As we changed seatsAn accident He begged my pardon  G GAN  An accident Ha did he not revoke in play  Lord LOVE  Misplay'd a spade I thinkAn oversight  G GAN  An oversight Did he not look askew at you all the evening  Lord LOVE  The gentleman General had the misfortune to have a cast in his eye  G GAN  A cast The misfortune Eh I would have cast him into the pit of perdition had he so squinted at me A cast lookye my Lord if you think such things to be put up with it is no business of mine My dignity will not suffer by it tho' my affinity to your Lordship makes me solicitous for the preservation of your honour  Lord LOVE  I am obliged to you General but I am not so captious as to regard such trifles in a serious light  G GAN  Mighty well my Lord mighty well Captious Ha Yes my Lord I am captious and exceptious too and you may think me capricious too if your Lordship pleases no matter but while I have the honour to be your Lordship's brotherinlaw and have the character of a soldier to maintain I will be tenacious too tenacious of the dignity of human nature my Lord And I say again if any rascal breathing had squinted at me as that fellow did last night at your Lordship I would have tumbled him down the precipice of perdition And so Lord Lovemore I bid your Lordship good day  turning round on his heel and strutting off the stage  G GAN  returning  I would my Lord by all that is great in man  again turning round on his hecl and strutting off His Lordship looking after him with a sarcastical smile  G GAN  again returning  You may smile my Lord but I would have crumbled his soul to powderto atoms my Lordto atomsto atoms  shaking his cane and stalking magisterially off the stage  Lord LOVE  Ha ha ha If this madman's disposition were not so mischievous it would be really entertaining It is to be hoped however his phrenzy is of that kind it will soon work its own cure  Enter  SERVANT  SERV  Captain Boothby my Lord  Enter  BOOTHBY  Lord LOVE  Did you meet the General Boothby  BOOTH  I came with him my Lord but supposing he had business with your Lordship I waited below till he retired  Lord LOVE  What can have possessed him to day  BOOTH  What always possesses him my Lord A spirit of contradiction  Lord LOVE  He would bring me into a quarrel here I know nothing of  BOOTH  He has been taking up a business too he says of mine But I neither know what it is nor can I get it out of him  Lord LOVE  Then let him keep it to himself The only good quality he has is that of sometimes keeping secret his own mischiefHow does Mrs Boothby to day You spend the evening with us  BOOTH  Lady Lovemore will have company  Lord LOVE  A private party only we shall not play high  BOOTH  Your Lordship is so obliging then as to pay attention to my finances  Lord LOVE  Faith I beg your pardon Boothby for the expression such attention is unnecessary I have as good as settled your preferment today There will be soon a general promotion and you are to have the regiment at Gibraltar  BOOTH  You gave me hopes my Lord of being provided for in England  Lord LOVE  I did so but so many difficulties stood in the way that to prevent delays I acquiesced You will be recalled home in a year or two at most so that it is much the same thing as if you were not to go  BOOTH  I know not that my Lord In the predicament I stand with my fatherinlaw my absence in the mean time may prove prejudicial to my interest  Lord LOVE  I can't see thatMrs Boothby will remain in England and perhaps effect a reconciliation the sooner without you I shall be ready to do her any services in my  power and if she even chuses a domestic protection Lady Lovemore will I am sure be happy in so agreeable a companion  BOOTH  Your Lordship's friendship is so generously imposing that I shall submit my conduct entirely to you if I can prevail on Mrs Boothby to acquit me of the promise I have made to take her with me should I be ordered abroad  Lord LOVE  Oh she is too reasonable a woman to insist on it A wife Boothby is a very troublesome messmate on shipboard and in a garrison But you will have time enough to reconcile her to so short an absence before you embark  BOOTH  I shall my Lord but I cannot acquaint her too soon with the success of your Lordship's negotiation I therefore humbly take my leave Your Lordship's obedient  Exit  Lord LOVE  Your servant Captain The wife of this Boothby must at any rate be mine She is a charming woman But they say she is virtuous and loves her husband What a villain then am I to go about to seduce her Yet why that question I may not succeed and mere intentional crimes are venial I'll risk the trial By providing for the husband I secure an interest in the gratitude of the wife Her affection for him shall plead for the love of her gallant But till it works effect I must be distant and reservedIt were as impolitic to alarm the modesty of a woman till some impression be made on her heart as for a General to give the signal to storm till he had effected a breach  Exit  End of ACT the Second  ACT III  SCENE I  An Apartment at  Sir Solomon Bauble's  Enter  WITMORE  and  EMILIA  WIT  Almost a week in London Emilia and not let

Some law business I find I wish my dear Emilia you would give me leave to talk to him on a more interesting subject  EM  What subject Sir  WIT  Can you be at a loss to guess after the many kind assurances you have flattered me with of a partiality for me  EM  I hardly know what I have flattered you with Mr Witmore But whatever was my partiality for you you should have known that a girl at my age had it not in her power to give herself away without the consent of her relations  WIT  Give me but your consent to make openly my addresses and I will do it immediately Sir Solomon I know regards nothing so much as money But though at present my fortune is not very considerable yet my connections and  expectations are such that I make no doubt of obtaining his consent  EM  For heaven's sake hush I hear him hobbling down stairs I have said enough to pave the way You will soon know more than I have confidence to tell you  Exit  Enter  Sir SOLOMON BAUBLE  Sir SOL  So Mr Witmore you have been chatting with my niece Emmeline She's a fine girl grown is not she shot up like an arrow And I dare say you think her fit for a husband  WIT  If she thinks so herself Sir Solomon Miss Emmeline is indeed grown a fine woman and I doubt not would make an excellent wife  Sir SOL  You think so eh Witmore Why to come to the point then it was on that subject I sent to talk with you  WIT  You do me an honour Sir Solomon so young a lawyer is seldom thought entitled to  aside  What will this lead to Surely she has not broke the ice herself  Sir SOL  Why truly I have so good an opinion of you Mr Witmore that I fixed my eye upon you as the most proper person I could think of I have been greatly obliged both to your talents and integrity  WIT  aside  'Tis certainly soshe said she had paved the way for me  to Sir Solomon  Your partiality Sir Solomon overrates my desert  Sir SOL  Not at allnot at all I have heard the highest commendations of you from the gentlemen of your own profession which

with marks of surprize and disappointment  Sir SOL  Sir hey dey why what's the matter Barrister Is not the job worth your acceptance I thought you would have seen to the making your friend Emilia's jointure secure though you had done it without a fee  WIT  confusedly  Jointure fee Sir Solomon To be sure I have a friendship for the young ladybuthath she made choice of a husband  Sir SOL  She poor young thing How should she know how to make choice of a husband Oh no That trouble was taken off her hands some time ago Her friends in India took care of thatGovernor Mammon who came over by the last ships contracted two years ago to marry her on his arrival in England under the penalty of a lack of rupees near twelve thousand pounds sterling So that you see we have long had the husband safe enough We have now only to secure her dowry and pinmoney  WIT  And the young lady abides by this same contract I suppose  Sir SOL  I'll warrant her Do you know Sir Governor Mammon is a nabob  WIT  aside  Then every woman is a jilt  To  Sir Sol    Pardon me Sir Solomon I am taken suddenly with a kind of vertigo the effect of setting up over a difficult case last night  Sir SOL  Ah the law the law is a vertiginous kind of study But come sit you down sit you down Lady Bauble is not stirring yet but Emmy shall give you a cordial I shall be back by the time you are recovered and have composed

made thus the dupe of a child a chit a girl  Enter  EMILIA  EM  running with looks of great concern  Bless me Mr Witmore what's the matter  WIT  Matter Miss I am too much ashamed to tell you and yet I know not whether I ought to blush most for myself or you  EM  Cruel Mr Witmore Then you know my situation and have no pity for me Would to Heaven I had never seen you  WIT  How can you justify yourself madam  EM  I don't pretend to it Sir I confess I have been to blame but I hardly knew the force or reflected on the consequences of the contract I had signed till you had taken advantage of my youth and inexperience to rob me of a heart which I ought to have preserved to give where they say I must give my hand If you love me as you have pretended therefore you will devise some method of delivering me from the bondage to which the will of arbitrary and mercenary parents for so I must call them have destined me  WIT  And does my Emmeline then wish to be freed from her contract with Governor Mammon  EM  I detest abhor the proposed union If therefore you can contrive any means to protract or prevent it you may depend on the concurrence of your Emmeline  WIT  My Emmeline Charming girl thou shalt then still be mine  He runs to embrace her  Enter  Sir SOLOMON  Sir SOL  Heyday This is friendly indeed What  WIT  softly to Emm  Sir Solomon  aloud  Miss Emmeline I wish you joy of so happy an event and will certainly take care the covenants shall be as binding as law can make them  They part ceremoniously  Sir SOL  aside  O ho is that all Egad my mind began to misgive me  to Emm  Ay Emmy Mr Witmore takes part in our happiness and will therefore take care of our interest  EM  I then shall leave my concerns entirely with him Sir but must beg he will take sufficient time to make every thing secure and proceed in nothing with precipitation  Exit  WIT  You shall be obliged madam even to the minutest punctilio of procrastination  Sir SOL  Oh no Sir No procrastination I have given my word of honour to the Governor that the lawyers shall dispatch their business without delay  WIT  That's impossible Sir A lawyer's dispatch always admits of delay  Enter  Lady BAUBLE  Lady BAU  What is that Sir you talk of delay I beg nothing may be deferred on any account whatever  WIT  There shall be no more delay than is necessary madam But a little procrastination is always usual on occasions of this kind it looks like a regard for decorum on the part of the lady  Lady BAU  We must dispense a little with decorum Sir The Governor must be complimented with a short day After such handsome presents A most superb set of ornamental china  Sir SOL  True wife and the mummy of an Egyptian Princess No no procrastination  Lady BAU  I think not where's my niece Wo'nt matrimony go down with her without procrastination Leave her to me Sir Solomonwoman's wit in these cases may do more than man's wisdomAnd do you Mr Witmore consult with Serjeant Nonplus the Governor's counsel and come both hither for more particular instructions immediately do the business as securely as possible and no procrastination I beg of you  Exit  WIT  I will obey you madam I shall just step into WestminsterHall to speak to Serjeant Nonplus and we will call upon you presently Sir Solomon your servant  Exit  Sir SOL  in a kind of reverie  Your fervant Siryour servantHa gone Odso what a pity I let the barrister go without introducing him to the Princess  Exit  SCENE II Capt Boothby's  Lodgings at  Mrs Goodwill's  Enter  Mrs BOOTHBY  and  Mrs GOODWILL  Mrs GOOD  I could indeed tell you such stories of Lord Lovemore madam  Mrs BOOTH  I am sufficiently shocked at what I have heard already Indeed I beg your pardon Mrs Goodwill I yesterday thought you too censorious but after his Lordship's unguarded behaviour at his own house last night I can  believe the worst of him and indeed have not the best opinion of his Lady Would you believe it Mrs Goodwill he had the confidence to make downright love to me to rail at Mr Boothby and even offer me his protection in the very presence of his wife I find too that Mr Boothby is to be promoted to the command of a regiment abroad  Mrs GOOD  And have you told the Captain your suspicions madam  Mrs BOOTH  I would not have him know them for the world The consequences would be fatal But what shall I do We are under an engagement to go to the masquerade to night  Mrs GOOD  To the masquerade madam Indeed it requires consideration Strange doings have been carried on at masquerades  Mrs BOOTH  Strange doings Mrs Goodwill You terrify me It is an entertainment I have the greatest curiosity to be present at But if there be any danger attending it I protest I will stay at home  Mrs GOOD  That resolution madam may perhaps too much alarm Captain Boothby  Mrs BOOTH  That's true and yetBut here they both comeI am so chagrined and perplexed I know not what to doCome come and sit with me awhile You must advise me  Exeunt  Enter  Lord LOVEMORE  and  BOOTHBY  BOOTH  A fit of the spleen my Lord Mere vapours It went off immediately on her coming into the air  Lord LOVE  I am glad to hear that  aside  A good omen she has not yet told her husband I sind  to Boothby  Why you were both the favourites of fortune I thought no lady had the spleen while she was winning at cards  BOOTH  Mrs Boothby has delicate nerves my Lord and is little used to late hours and the card table Your Lordship may have your revenge however at any time on me  Lord LOVE  I intend to have it on both I assure you  BOOTH  With all my heart my Lord when and where you please  Lord LOVE  To morrow night thento night you know we go to the masquerade  BOOTH  Be it so  Lord LOVE  affecting a langh  Ha ha ha Faith Boothby thou art the happiest fellow in the worldYou have an angel of a woman for your wife And so she did not tell you the reason of her breaking away so suddenly last night I must let you into the secret lest through mistake she think hardly of me  BOOTH  Why so my Lord  Lord LOVE  You must know that to get rid of the effusions of her gratitude which she took an opportunity to pour out on me for the trouble I have taken to solicit your preferment I in raillery made love to her by telling her how easily she might get rid of the obligation  BOOTH  And she took you to be in earnest Ha ha ha  Lord LOVE  Even so but it was in the presence of Lady Lovemore so that 'twas impossible I could mean any thing you know  Lady LOVE  No my Lord I am very sure you did not You will excuse Mrs Boothby  Lord LOVE  Nay you must make my excuse to her She left us so abruptly that she gave me no time to come to an explanation  BOOTH  Will you apologize for yourself my Lord Mrs Boothby is within  Lord LOVE  No no it will come better from you I must away to the Secretary at war To tell you the truth I heard yesterday of a vacancy at home that may be worth your acceptance and therefore desired an interview with him to day If I succeed in your behalf you shall know what it is If it be already disposed of for there are innumerable solicitants we will think of it as a gem long lost and watch the next opportunity of meeting with its fellow  BOOTH  I am infinitely indebted to your Lordship for this obliging attention to my interest  Lord LOVE  I only wish I may be able to serve you as I intendBut I must goMean time do you hear Boothby make my peace with your wife before I see her again  Exit  BOOTH  I will my LordHow noble and generous is it in his Lordship to give himself all this trouble of application for me And yetwhen I reflect on Mrs Boothby's behaviour last night and this whimsical tale of a love story I don't half like it His Lordship is a man of intrigue and the liberties which men of rank think themselves authorized to take in this age of gallantry with their inferiors are alarming I must speak to Mrs Boothby But she'll not be open enough to tell me if there should be any thing in it left it should breed a quarrel Phoo hang it it cannot be neither in the presence of his own wife And she one of the best and most amiable women in the universe I am ashamed of the suspicion It is to the last degree injurious to so generous so disinterested a friend What a mean contracted heart is this of mine I blush to think I am possessed of such a narrow soul  Enter  SERVANT  introducing  General GANTLET  SERV  General Gantlet Sir  Servant retires  BOOTH  Good morrow General  GAN  Good morrow BoothbyYou come off winner last night  BOOTH  Unaccountably so A novice among adepts and yet so fortunate  GAN  Adepts Sharpers  BOOTH  What mean you General  GAN  The stranger in blue and gold gave you the game every time  BOOTH  That was very obliging in a stranger General But I know no reason for it  GAN  Then I would make him give one Colonel Basto assures me he has seen him at Bath and knows him to be a common gambler Lord Lovemore should be called to account for introducing such a scoundrel into company at his own house You know in regard to my sister it would look ill in me or elseBut I'll carry him a civil message for you  BOOTH  To Lord Lovemore My best friend impossible to think of it General He must have been imposed on in the character of the gentleman Or if not gamblers now get into the company of the first people in the kingdom  GAN  Not in private parties at their own houses Sir However you may do as you pleaseYou may put up with itBut if any other person had introduced a fellow that bad taken the liberty to put his money into my pocket  BOOTH  Nay but consider General Lord Lovemore is my friend my patron and no very distant relation a man of high rank and your brotherinlaw  GAN  Were he the first Duke in the land brotherinlaw to any body but myself Sir here here  holding open his fingers  would I pillory his noseHe should breathe through these fingers Sir and breathe his last  BOOTH  aside  I must give into the humour of this Goth or he may work himself to attack my Lord himself  to Gen Gantlet  Well then General to oblige you  GAN  Oblige me Sir▪ Oblige yourself support your own dignity Mr Boothby  BOOTH  I Will General and call his Lordship to account on the subject of last night depend on it  GAN  Do my boy that's a brave lad Ever while you live Boothby support your own dignity  Exit strutting magisterially off the stage  Enter  Mrs BOOTHBY  at the oppsite door in a fright  Mrs BOOTH  Bless me Mr Boothby what is it you have promised that savage General What is it he has been advising you Challenge Lord Lovemore indeed my dear there was nothing in the foolish affair of last night that should excite such resentment It was a capricious mistake of my own He could not mean any thingLady Lovemore herself was by and heard every word that was said  BOOTH  I know it my dear But why are you so much alarmed The General is not in his dignitystilts this morning upon your account  Mrs BOOTH  Not on my account  BOOTH  He took umbrage it seems at losing his money last night and would set every body quarrelling that was concerned in winning it  Mrs BOOTH  aside  How have my curiosity and impatience betrayed me  BOOTH  Nay child never mind it You have only betrayed a little secret that I knew before But why will you keep such foolish secrets from me A woman should have no confidant in these matters but her husband Lord Lovemore is much mord open and ingenuous He has confided in me already and has been just now telling the whole story  Mrs BOOTH  aside  Specious deceiver but I dare not expose him  BOOTH  Indeed my dear if your error did not proceed from an amiable cause in which I am so deeply interested I should think you greatly to blame His Lordship is so noble so generous a friend that I would not disoblige him for the world Even common gratitude should induce us to put the most favourable construction on his behaviour Would you believe that he is now gone to the Secretary at War of his own accord to solicit a post for me which he hears is become vacant at home He seems to take a concern in my interest as if it were his own  Mrs BOOTH  aside  Artful villain I can no longer bear it  Exit bursting into tears  BOOTH  Tears of gratitude susceptible creature how will she reproach herself now for having harboured an unjust suspicion of our best benefactor  Enter  Lady LOVEMORE  Lady Lovemore What nobody waiting there  Lady LOVE  Nay no ceremony Sir I came in without it because I would not disturb Mrs Boothby I hope her last night's indisposition is attended with no ill consequences  BOOTH  Your ladyship's solicitude is obliging None at all it appears to have been a mere capricio as insignificant as the innocent cause of it  Lady LOVE  As the cause of it Mr Boothby  BOOTH  Yes madam my Lord has been here this morning and has related to me the whole circumstance  Lady LOVE  affecting to laugh  He he he and was there ever any thing so ridiculous You may think yourself a happy man Mr Boothby in so good a wife but I protest if every married woman were as exceptious as Mrs Boothby there would be no keeping up conversation between people of fashion of different sexes an hour together  BOOTH  Your ladyship is perfectly in the right Mrs Boothby's behaviour was certainly too exceptious  Lady LOVE  Oh preposterous we must rally her out of this rustic prudery or she will be fit to keep company with nobody but yourself Mr Boothby I must go and give her a lecture indeed I must teach her to think and act a little more like folks of this world  Exit  BOOTH  How easy spirited and engaging Well after all though virtue be a jewel it is like a diamond which of the first water must yet be polished before it displays its lustre How admirable is the behaviour of this Lady Lovemore Mrs Boothby has not less natural goodness of heart or of native beauty but to how much more advantage would they appear if she had her ladyship's artificial habit of displaying them She will profit I dare say by so striking an example Indeed my wife is as fortunate in having acquired the friendship of Lady Lovemore as I am in that of his Lordship  Exit  SCENE III Sir Solomon Bauble's  Enter  Serjeant NONPLUS

Deserves another Mr Serjeant  Ser NON  Nay if by marrying the young Lady you make your fortune and retire from the bar you may give me all your interest too  WIT  I'll do it Mr Serjeant  Ser NON  Yes but I will have no hand in any thing but delay There is no disrepute in the law's delay I would not do any thing disreputable for the world It will hurt me in my practice master Witmore  WIT  Disrepute and dishonesty Mr Serjeant as you shrewdly hint are two things Our practice does not depend on our integrity but on our reputation for it  Ser NON  A just distinction True character character is all You may do what you will if you be but artful or lucky enough to preserve your character  WIT  And if that be neglected or unluckily lost be as honest as one will it will signify nothing  Ser NON  Egad Mr Witmore for a young man you seem to know a good deal of the world It is almost a pity the bar should lose so promising a casuist You would make a figure at nisi prius and pleas of the crown  WIT  You flatter me Mr Serjeant But young adventurers at the bar like soldiers of fortune in arms should lose no fair opportunity of advancing themselves out of the line of their profession  Ser NON  Egad that's truea fortune's a fortune no matter how we come by it as our old friend Horace says Rem facias Remquocunque modo Rem  WIT  Ay Mr Serjeant that Rem is the thingbut I see the young lady coming this way If you will just walk into that room I'll be with you presently  Exit Serjeant  Enter  EMILIA  EM  Well Mr Witmore I have considered of your scheme But I am afraid I shall not be able to set governor Mammon so much against me as to make him refuse to fulfill the contract  WIT  Well at the worst he cannot compell you to fulfil it It is an adjudged case that the marriagecontract of a minor is not binding But never fear play but your part with discretion my dear Emily and you cannot fail to deter him from the match Repel his first attacks with vivacity and you shall find me and Serjeant Nonplus who is within ready to compleat his repulse  EM  I would fain have the refusal come from him And yet  WIT  Nay my dear Emmeline start no more objections I thought I had fully satisfied your scruples when you satisfied mine Love knows no bonds no shackles but what it imposes on itself It disdains the formal restrictions imposed on it by others and submits to no obligations but those of the heart  EM  smiling  But is this law Mr Witmore  WIT  The law of love my dear Emmeline which is the law of liberty  EM  And is there nothing inequitable in the case eh  WIT  Why to say truth there is some little difference between law and equity in most cases But the court of love my dear Emmeline is a court of common law and is governed  by ancient customs and usages time immemorial of which none is of longer standing than that of a woman's changing her mind We shall certainly carry our point therefore at law which will put me in possession of your charms and then let equity disposess me of them if it can  EM  How lucky it is that I have fallen into the hands of so great a lawyer  Exeunt  End of the Third ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I Sir Solomon Bauble's  Enter  Governor MAMMON  and  Lady BAUBLE  Lady BAU  With a due reciprocation of civilities Sir I must needs say that your actions bespeak it There is indeed a generosity in your behaviour that hath charmed us all except my niece Emmeline I cannot think what's come to the girl but she's grown quite hypocondriac as I tell her  G MAM  Thoughtful perhaps on her approaching change of condition Madam  Lady BAU  Or perhaps Governor she expected a present as well as Sir Solomon and myself We women are all a little mercenary you know And besides she might think it a mark of disrespect that she had none One cannot tell these young things who know but a little of the world have strange conceptions  G MAM  I should be sorry Madam that Miss Emmeline's inexperience should cause her to censure me for want of respect but I reserved such testimony of my regard for her till I should have the honour of presenting it myself This casket of diamonds  Lady BAU  And have you brought her a casket of diamonds then Oh she'll brighten up at the diamonds I'll warrant her I'll send her to you immediately But here she is  Enter  EMILIA  Come niece Emmeline here is Governor Mammon that is to be your husband you know  taking hold of her band and leading her toward the Governor who advances to salute her  As you must have a great deal to say to one another I leave you together Governor  aside  I long to have their confabulation over that I may contemplate the beauty of the diamonds  Exit  G MAM  bowing as he retires from faluting her  Miss Emmeline your slave  aside  a fine girl grown faith  to her  You will permit me to present you with this token of my respect before I enter on the subject of my love  taking a casket out of his pocket and presenting it to her  EM  putting aside the casket with her hand  By no means Sir Before I receive any present from you Governor it is proper I should know what return I can make you  G MAM  There needs no return Madam  EM  True Governor if I become your wife in which case your present is a mere piece of gallantry and you may almost as well take it out of one hand and put it into the other You stile yourself my slave but rather call me your's for I am certain you think so  G MAM  Miss Emmeline  EM  Nay Sir be not surprized I am not now Governor the poor simple girl that was prevailed on to enter into a contract with you in India of which I have but lately understood the impropriety  G MAN  Indeed Madam there seems to be a great alteration both in your person and sentiments But as I admire the one I presume the other will make no alteration in the nature of our connexion  EM  A groundless hope Governor To be plain with you I find that women educated in England not only bestow  their persons in marriage but that they have minds also which are interested in the event of that union souls Governor of which you Asiatic tyrants will hardly allow us women to boast the possession  G MAM  Why really Miss Emmeline you seem to be possessed of a soul indeed if one may judge by this specimen of your spirit But as the philosophers hold the soul to be of no sex we Asiatics as you call us wisely think the best part of a woman is her person  EM  And you would be mean enough to accept the hand of a woman who had disposed of her heart to another  G MAM  Why look ye madam if a woman takes upon her to dispose of what is not her property but has been made over to another I don't see why the first owner may not without the imputation of meanness reclaim it But is that really the case Miss Emmeline  EM  Indeed governor it is  G MAM  Then you have dealt disingenuously by me madam  putting the casket into his pocket  EM  How so Sir If all you require of a woman be the possession of her person what matters it on whom she bestows her affections  G MAM  I looked on both in you as equally my property  EM  Why there Sir it is just as I saidYou look upon me as your property your purchased slave and would doubtless treat me as such were we married You would be for taking me back to India to make up the number of your Zenana your seraglio of female favorites But that is not in your power Sir were I even married to you without my own consent And be assured I shall never willingly leave a country in which the privileges of our sex are so well respected and secured An English wife Governor  G MAM  Is as great a tyrant  EM  As an Eastern husband  G MAM  Indeed  EM  She may at least set her husband's tyranny at defiance and repay his neglect of her in kind So beware Governor what you do and as you approve the hint precipitate our nuptials  Exit  G MAM  Hey day what a termagant young devil it is grown Yes yes she returned to England to finish her education with a vengeance No no madam I'll not marry to go back to India and leave you in England neither If I do marry you I will certainly get divorced before I go or compell you to go with me The privileges of an English wife truly Repay their neglect in kind What a poor devil is an English husband  Enter  WITMORE  and Serjeant  NONPLUS  from within  Ser NON  Governor your servant  G MAM  Well met Mr SerjeantEgad you are luckily encountered here I must have a little of your advice or my young Tartar from Bengal will prove too much for me  Ser NON  What's the matter Sir  G MAM  This morning you know I consulted you about the shortest method of fulfilling a certain matrimonial contract And now I believe I must consult you on the shortest way of dissolving it  Ser NON  So suddenly Sir  WIT  What on the first interview Governor  G MAM  Why the yonng lady speaks her mind so plainly that I've no need of a second  Ser NON  She is not to your fancy then Governor  G MAM  Or rather I am not to hers She has taken a fancy to somebody else it seems  WIT  And did she own it to you  G MAM  Yes faith she was explicit enough in all conscience I cannot complain of her reserve You must find out some way therefore gentlemen to dissolve this same contract  WIT  Impossible Governor without fulfilling the condition of the obligation  G MAM  What must I be married to such a shrew against my will  WIT  O no Sir on the payment of a lack of Rupees you may be excused These are the terms of the contract as I take it  G MAM  Yes but as I take it that forfeiture is too considerable I'll marry her tho' it be to have the pleasure of divorcing her the next day  WIT  True Governor if that pleasure might be so soon had  G MAM  May it not I understood divorces were now become as frequent in England as in the East  Ser NON  They are pretty frequent indeed Governor and when the parties are agreed are easily brought about But if either be refractory they are somewhat dilatory and expensive  G MAM  And pray Gentlemen in what time and expence upon an average now may a man by the laws of England get rid of a refractory wife  WIT  By the law of reason and therefore by the laws of England Sir it should be very soon  Ser NON  But by the practice of them it cannot be at all  G MAM  How Sir  Ser NON  Even so Sir a new law must be expressly made for that purpose  WIT  By that means it may be brought about  G MAM  Well no matter for the means the time and expence  Ser NON  Let me feeThe time and expence Crim con we must take for granted  G MAM  Ay ay in all appearance we shall want no no proof of that  Ser NON  An action may be prosecuted in the Temporal Court a reasonable time and a moderate expence brother Witmore  WIT  Yes yes we common lawyers have some conscience  Ser NON  Verdict obtained at Westminster we go into the commons A libel is institutedrecrimination ensues  G MAM  Recrimination What's that Mr Serjeant  Ser NON  The recrimination of the canonists Sir is the antecatagory of the civilians  G MAM  It is Oh ho that makes every thing very plain  WIT  You must know Governor our canonists maintain that a woman may as lawfully go astray from her husband as a man from his wife  G MAM  The devil  WIT  Yes Sir and our married women of course play the devil on the authority  Ser NON  Pope Boniface the th Sir as the priests had no wives of their own indulgently promulgated this doctrine for them to preach to the wives of others  G MAM  But what have we to do with Pope Boniface or his indulgencies  Ser NON  More than you may imagine Governor The  reformatio legum  not taking place the papal cannons continue still in force and  Si quando mulier maritum  but perhaps I had better speak plain English  G MAM  By all means Mr Serjeant if you can As you are upon a matter of importance I should be glad to understand you  Ser NON  Then Sir to put the case familiarly thus If Jack A being lawfully married to Jill B peradventure Jill should prove a jade as now a days it is ten to one but she does yet nevertheless and notwithstanding if the said Jill make it appear that the said Jack is as bad as herself it is in such case to be adjudged that the parties Jack and Jill are well matched and it were a sin to separate so worthy a couple  G MAM  Confound the pope and all his adherents  Ser NON  With all my heart Governor except out brethren in the commons with whom to proceed  WIT  Ay ay proceed

then meet with her ten to one in my round If not tell her I shall call to take her with me in the evening I must run away immediately  Going out is met by General Gantlet  GAN  stopping her  Don't put yourself in a fluster sister I am sorry for your Ladyship's situation but these things will happen  Lady LOVE  Happen General What will happen  GAN  Nay madam I thought by your flurry you had heard more than IBut if you have heard nothing and will promise me not to be frightened I will tell you  Lady LOVE  Promise not to be frightenedYou have frightened me to death already But indeed you are always terrifying me with some disaster or other What's the matter now  GAN  Nay it may come to nothing therefore it is time enough to be alarmedMrs Goodwill  Mrs GOOD  Sir  GAN  What time did Mr Boothby go out  Mrs GOOD  I cannot exactly say the hour Sir But it was soon after you left him this morning Lord Lovemore called in again and they went out together  GAN  As I thought That is two or three hours ago Mr Boothby you find sister is not returned and I am just come from your house where they know nothing of his Lordship so that it is plain one or both of them must have dropped  Lady LOVE  Dropped Lord Lovemore or Mr Boothby Heaven and earth Was there any quarrel between them  GAN  Quarrel madam Was it not unavoidable after the affair of last night  Mrs GOOD  So this rash General has been fomenting mischief and stirring up strife again  Lady LOVE  And what brother had you to do with the affair of last night  GAN  I will not suffer the honour of my friends madam to be hurt by their pusillanimity And while I have that of being your husband's brotherinlaw he shall neither give nor take an affront if I can help it without resenting or being called to account for it  Lady LOVE  Your notions of honour brother are ridiculous Is it less dishonourable for a man to cut his friend's throat than to be civil to his wife  GAN  I am an old batchelor you know and know nothing about wives But if Boothby has not cut your husband's throat for the insult offered him at your house laft night he is a  Lady LOVE  And so you have been setting them to sighting I find Oh I shall faint I shall die My poor Lord is certainly  killed He is murdered  She throws herself into the chair and affects to faint away  Mrs GOOD  running to her assistance and taking smelling bottle from her pocket  Help help here Pray General lay hold of the Lady's hand and keep it open  GAN  Me not I madam I know nothing of palmistry  Mrs GOOD  Bless me General how could you go to frighten my Lady in this manner  GAN  Poh frightened If his Lordship be killed he dies like a man of honour and she may the sooner get another husband  Lady LOVE  recovering  Talk not to me brother of another husband I shall never live to support the loss of this  Enter  BOOTHBY  GAN  Ha Boothby  turns on his heel and walks to the back of the stage  Lady LOVE  Oh Mr Boothby wherewhere is my poor Lord barbarous man have you indeed then left him dead or shall I see him again alive  throwing herself again into the chair  BOOTH  aside  So so so Honour and dignity has been making fine work of it here I find  to Lady Lovemore  Your poor Lord madam I left him rich alive and well not five minutes ago turning over the habits at Pritchard's  Lady LOVE  Heaven be praised  Mrs GOOD  So say I my Lady Let me beg of your Ladyship to compose yourself You see nothing has happened that should thus distress you  GAN  having taken Boothy aside  So nothing came of it Ha what disarm'd A scratch only Eh Egad I wish I had said nothing about it  BOOTH  I believe indeed it had been better General  Lady LOVE  rising from her chair  Inhuman brother Why why will you be thus perpetually frightening me You had better draw your sword and pierce my bosom at once than be thus ever terrifying me with false alarms  GAN  Fire and furies madam draw upon a woman I that have dared death and destruction at the head of a line of battle What effeminacy have you ever seen in me madam to think I should contaminate my sword with the blood of a woman It is well madam it is not your husband that insults me thus If he had I would have wrung off his neck as I would that of a turkeycock Draw my sword on a woman But 'tis a woman's insult and so I put up with the indignity  Exit  Lady LOVE  Bless me Mr Boothby this brother of mine is quite frantic Is there no method of curing this ridiculous folly  BOOTH  I am afraid not madam but I'll make a trial I fancy I could frighten him as much as he has frightened your Ladyship  Lady LOVE  Would you could Captain Boothby it would give me great satisfaction and might have some good effect on him for really his caprices are dreadful  Enter  SERVANT  with a Letter for  BOOTHBY  SERV  A letter Sirthe bearer said it required no answer but must be given into your hands immediately  BOOTH  Your Ladyship will excuse me  Lady LOVE  No apology Mr Boothbybusiness must be mindedI must hurry away to assist Mrs Boothby in the choice of her dress  BOOTH  Your Ladyship's humble servant  Exit  Lady LOVEMORE  Now let me see reads  To Capt Boothby  If Captain Boothby would prevent his wife's ruin and preserve his own honour he will hinder her going to the masquerade with Lord Lovemore or when there will most carefully watch the behaviour of his Lordship  The handwriting is a woman's and resembles that of Lady Lovemore but it cannot be hersshe is to accompany my wife and therefore would hardly dissuade me from letting her go Besides she seems not to have the least tincture of jealousy in her dispositionYet now I reflect come this notice from whom it will it may not be proper to neglect it Mrs Boothby's conduct is mysterious Her resentment last night at Lord Lovemore's was unaffected and natural And though the passed off the matter slightly to day the manner in which she did it was neither easy nor naturalThere may be something more in this business than I am aware of I will take Mrs Boothby to task roundly for her reserve I'll make her believe I know more than I do that she may tell me more than I know Here she comes  Enter  Mrs BOOTHBY  Come hither madam I have something to say to youbut first let me shut the door  Mrs BOOTH  Something to say to me and such preparation it must be of importance sure Mr Boothby  BOOTH  It is madam Tell me Mrs Boothby taking her hastily by the hand and tell me truly as you value my future quiet and your own happiness have you dealt fairly by me  Mrs BOOTH  Bless me Mr Boothby what do you mean You terrify me to death by this earnestness Dealt fairly by you  BOOTH  Ay fairly Mrs Boothby  Mrs BOOTH  Witness Heaven that I have done it ever  BOOTH  Nay call not Heaven to witness a falsehood You have deceived me Mrs BoothbyYou have treacherously concealed from me a secret which I ought to have known and which had I not by other means discovered it might have proved our ruin  Mrs BOOTH  Of what falsehood What deceit What treachery have I been guilty  BOOTH  You told me to day that you thought Lord Lovemore meant nothing by the behaviour you resented last night  Mrs BOOTH  Unkind Mr Boothby did not you yourself say every thing to persuade me so Did you not say that gratitude for the obligations his Lordship sought to confer on us required the most favourable construction to be put on his actions  BOOTH  Obligations madam had he laid obligations on me till he had raised pile to reach the skies the favour he sought to confer by your means would have tumbled them all down and buried them in oblivion It is in vain to conceal It any longer This letter this letter madam has given me damnable intimations of the favours intended us  Mrs BOOTH  By all my hopes of happiness both here and hereafter I declare I have concealed nothing from you but out of motives of the most sincere fidelity and affectionate tenderness I knew you to be so jealous of your honour that I dreaded the fatal consequences of telling you all  BOOTH  And are not you madam equally jealous of my honour that out of such mistaken tenderness for my personal  safety you would betray the most invaluable treasure of my soul I Would you from so weak a motive subject me to be pointed at as the credulous dupe the easy fool the wittol of a titled rascal whom I caress as a friend  Mrs BOOTH  Indeed indeed you wrong me Mr Boothby Heaven forbid I should be put to the trial but I think I could sacrifice every thing I hold most dear to the preservation of your honour  BOOTH  As far as it is dependent on your fidelity you may think it safe The worst even a bad woman can do is to make herself ridiculous it is on herself only that she can entail infamy But men of honour madam have a degree of it to maintain superior to that which is in a woman's keeping  Mrs BOOTH  I understand you not  BOOTH  I will myself madam be the guardian both of my own honour and of yours I have before told you a woman's best confidant is her husband  Mrs BOOTH  Will you then promise to command your temper and not be urged by that of others to violence  BOOTH  I will  Mrs BOOTH  Then will I positively confide in you and should his Lordship make any farther advances acquaint you with it And now my dear let me know the contents of that letter  BOOTH  Read it  gives Mrs Boothby the letter and looks at her attentively while she reads it  Well madam what think you of it  Mrs BOOTH  I think it is the contrivance of a very artful and a very jealous woman  BOOTH  My Lady Lovemore  Mrs BOOTH  It is her handthough purposely disguised I am sure of it I was before this almost tempted to  think her base enough to countenance the gallantries of her husband  BOOTH  Impossible with her you are safe whatever be the designs of his Lordship  Mrs BOOTH  Then you would have me still go to the masquerade  BOOTH  By all means we cannot with any kind of decency break the appointment without breaking at once with Lord Lovemore which neither good manners nor prudence will yet justify  Mrs BOOTH I will then go in to dress Pritchard has promised to send me the habit you so much admired to day  Exit  Manet  BOOTHBY  How loose are the principles of men of intrigue And how often do we attribute to motives of humanity and generosity a conduct influenced by the desire of gratifying personal vanity or mere animal appetite Lord Lovemore is to sunk in my esteem that I can place no confidence in his honour I shall so far take the letterwriter's advice therefore as to watch his motions to night very narrowly  Enter  Mrs GOODWILL  Oh Mrs Goodwill if General Gantlet should return I have a little plot upon him which you must assist me in Lady Lovemore wishes to be revenged on him for the fright he has just put her in Now the General was duelling yesterday and wounded his antagonist the wounds I understand are not dangerous but it will be easy for us to persuade him that they are mortal  Mrs GOOD  An excellent device if it should but terrify him to run away His honour and dignity would be finely mortified before he discovered the trick that was put on him  BOOTH  Egad here he comesdo you be within hearing Mrs Goodwill and second my attempt as you see necessary  Mrs GOOD  You may depend on me Sir  Exit  Reenter  General GANTLET  GAN  I forgot Boothby to ask you if you intend playing the fool at the Haymarket to night I think of going  BOOTH  Egad General I believe you had better think of a prudent expedition to the continent You acted the part of a man it seems so seriously with your antagonist yesterday that you should be careful how you play the fool to night I understand he lies at the point of death  GAN  Zounds The surgeon told me he was in no danger  BOOTH  Yes but it seems they have called in another of more dangerous practice and he declares otherwise So that if the man dies General the lawyers who know nothing about the point of honour you know  GAN  Confound the surgeons and the lawyers tooDie let him die and be sepulchred on a dunghill  BOOTH  Nay but confider General I would have you make off by all means and get out of the kingdom as fast as you can  GAN  Make off What like a housebreaker or a highwayman Make off  BOOTH  Nay General don't be angry But if you stay and matters stand as I hear them related you will run the utmost danger  GAN  But is it not derogatory to a man's dignity to fly from danger  BOOTH  If it threatened only from the point of a bayonet or the mouth of a culverin I grant you General But when it appears in the form of a halter and the gallows  GAN  Egad you say true Boothby there is no dignity in the gallows I will decamp  Enter  Mrs GOODWILL  in haste  Mrs GOOD  Bless me gentlemen I am almost frightened out of my wits Here has been two of Sir John Fielding's people enquiring after General Gantlet But as I heard of the ugly affair that happened yesterday I said his honour was not hereThe servant says they are still lurking about the street Therefore pray take care how you go out General What a thing it would be if your honour's dignity should come to be hanged  G GAN  Hell and the devil what shall I doNot that I value my life Capt Boothby of a button I have shewn that at the head of a line of battle but to be throttled with a halter the indignity of it Boothby I shall die with shame under the indignity of it  BOOTH  Let me seeWhat can be done in this emergency You might escape under disguise and that the more readily as it is masquerade night But a domino is not sufficient and I have no other at hand  Mrs GOOD

Achilles you know who outhectored Hector was glad to conceal himself under one of his mother's maids short petticoats  Nay Hercules himself changed his club for a distaff and threw off his lion's skin

assist to dress Gant  GAN  while he is dressing  Lookye Boothby it is not because I fear to die I have shewn that as I said before in the field of battle Nor that I think I have done wrong in ridding the world of a rascalI could die with a safe conscience But the manner of it Boothby The manner of it I would avoid the indignity of being carted with streetrobbers and footpads Might I be indulged in the satisfaction of being blown from the mouth of a cannon or plead privilege to have the honour of being decapitated like a gentleman may I be crucified if I would budge a foot But to be dragged like a calf with a rope about its neck to the slaughter to hear widemouthed hawkers cry my last dyingspeech and confession Come come Mrs Goodwill make haste with your petticoat Hercules himself wore a

foolish curiosity How miserable it has made me I did not think I could have been so suddenly jealous My wife Cannot sure encourage Lord Lnvemore And yet as I watched them about the rooms I surprized her in such familiar conversation with him She did not speak loud enough for me to hear what she said indeed but she seemed to whisper so frequently and her signs were so significantly encouraging her attitudes so provokingly inviting that I was several times in the mind to pluck the mask from her face and expose her him and myself to the CompanyI did not imagine she could so readily have entered into the spirit of the place Who knows in her  gaité de coeur  how far things may be carried  They may have left the rooms for greater freedom of conversation elsewhere Confound the crowd in which I lost fight of them  Going Stops short  Ha here they are Bring him home to her own lodgings Is this simplicity or art I fear I have been made their dupe But I'll see a little more  Retires behind the

impatient to hear the confirmation of his happiness from those charming lips  Going up to door finds it locked  Ha locked Open the door this instant madam or by  heavens I'll split it into a thousand pieces Provoke not the rage of an injured husband left he should be no longer able to restrain it  Lord LOVE  On my honour Mr Boothby no injury hath been done you  BOOTH  Perhaps less than was

that an unforeseen accident likewise prevented her Ladyship's going Indeed my Lord came afterwards to apologize for her and pressed me so hard to accompany him that in order to get rid of his importunity I was in a manner obliged to promise I would follow him so that Mrs Goodwill told you no untruth  BOOTH  But why impose on me by equivocation  Mrs BOOTH  That I mightoot deprive yoo of an amusement my dear merely because I could not partake of it myself I thought you would return when you did not find me among the masks  BOOTH  I thought I had found you madam  Mrs BOOTH  In the person I suppose to whom my habit was sent by mistake You have no reason I hope to be much displeased at your disappointment  BOOTH  As you were prudent enough to disappoint his Lordship I am satisfied  Lord

foolery  Lady LOVE  I shall never repent my Lord of preventing you doing what you yourself would havemuch more reason to repent of Mrs Boothby I hope will excuse my personating her on this occasion as well as the artifices I made use of to procure her habit and detain her at home  Mrs BOOTH  Your Ladyship need not apologize to me for any thing that is past  BOOTH  And what says Lord Lovemore to

Exeunt  THOMAS  and  CONSTABLE  G MAM  Is the young lady overtaken then Sir Solomon  Sir SOL  Yes yes we have housed her She's safe enough above stairs if we can but prevail on this gentleman to part with her Though he cares not for the authority of fathers or guardians he may respect perhaps the prerogatives and privileges of a husband  BOOTH  A husband Sir Solomon I Is your niece then the gentleman's wife  G MAM  She must be Sir if I'm disposed to marry her  BOOTH  Perhaps not Sir if she is not so already but here she comes  Enter  Mr WITMORE  and  EMILIA  Lady BAU  Another metamorphosis So madam you thought your shallow cunning could outwit your uncle's and my profound sagacity did you  G MAM  to Wit How Mr Witmore Is it you that are my rival  WIT  The young lady Governor hath preferred me to be her guardian and no violence must be offered her inclinations  G MAM  Nor shall there Barrister on my account I promise you  Sir SOL  How Sir  G MAM  I have this afternoon Sir Solomon been informed by a relation whom I advised of my arrival that this young Barrister is my nephew  WIT  Sir  Sir SOL  How the Governor your uncle and you so undutiful at not to know any thing about him  G MAM  His ignorance of me is excuseable Sir Solomon It is long since I corresponded with the family He may possibly have heard of me but there have been so many Mammons of late years imported from India that had the name implied affinity he might have expected a cargo of cousins by every fleet But know me now young gentleman for your uncle  embracing him  Lady BAU  Well but what is to become of our niece  G MAM  Why give her to my kinsman Madam I really think the young lady hath provided better for herself than her friends had provided for her  Sir SOL  And do you resign her to him Governor  G MAM  Why look ye Sir Solomon I did not chuse to forfeit my lack of Rupees but as the money will not now go out of the family I can refign the lady without reluctance So that if you consent to their marriage the young folks shall not be disappointed  Sir SOL  Well what say you to the proposal my lady  Lady BAU  Say Sir Solomon What is there to be said Governor Mammon having a right to claim Emilia for himself he has  a fortiori  as the Logicians say a right to dispose of her to his Nephew  Sir SOL  Well then Barrister with the Governor's leave I don't say take her but as you have got you may keep her  WIT  I thank you Sir Solomon But to you Sir  Speaking to Governor Mammon  I know not how to make my acknowledgements  G MAM  When we are better acquainted Nephew you may learn  Sir SOL  Ay ayand as you have got so good an Uncle and a wife into the bargain Barrister you ought to be satisfied  WIT  Not quite Sir You will give me leave to hope you will extend your goodness also to my friend Boothby and your daughter  Mrs BOOTH  May I hope for so great a blessing as your pardon madam  To Lady Bauble  Lady BAU  Sir Solomon  Sir SOL  Nay if it rests with metherethere take both our blessings between you It is all I can spru at present tho' take that with you  BOOTH  I hope otherwise Sir  WIT  Never fear Boothby when favour once comes fortune will soon follow  Enter General  GANTLET  in his own cloathes  G GAN  By heavens this is not to be put up with Bedizen'd like a strumpet dogg'd by thieftakers dragged along like a streetwalker Capt Boothby I must have satisfaction for all this I understand it was a plot of yours and my lady sister's to expose me As to her she is a woman and I'll have nothing more to do with petticoats  BOOTH  Faith General I ask your pardon with all my heart But I acted in concert with Lady Lovemore merely to set this savage custom of duelling you are so absurdly fond of in a ridiculous light  G GAN  Yes faith I feel myself ridiculous enough in all conscience But my dignity Boothby  BOOTH  How General Doth dignity consist in the brutal custom of cutting throats like cannibals in cold  blood Did the heroes of antiquity want dignity Yet did Caesar ever send a challenge to Cato or Cato to Caesar  G GAN  Caesar and Cato Boothby were clever fellows in their day no doubt Yes your Caesars and Catos must have been fine fellows in there time But sword and pistol were not then in vogue and the fighting one's friends was not come in fashion You may call me absurd if you will but how is a man of honour at present to support his consequence without having recourse to the Duel  BOOTH  By having recourse to his goodnature my dear General Believe me there is often more fortitude in forgiving an injury than in revenging it and always more dignity in despising insults than in resenting them  THE END  EPILOGUE  Writen by the AUTHOR  And spoken by Miss BARSANTI  WELL men of valour how do ye like our play  Nothing against it sure the Ladies say  To own they're pleas'd the critics ever loth  May cry "A Duellist with scarce an oath  "'Tis like his hat that was without a feather  "Duels and dammes always go together"  Old sinners loving the licentious joke  May think there wants too here and there a stroke  Round oaths and double meanings strew'd between  With them the virtues of the comic scene  And yet the Town in general is so nice  It holds these virtues as a kind of vice  From the teeth outwards chaste their hands before 'em  Like reps ev'n demireps are all decorum  Though gross their thoughts so delicate their hearing  They think the very stage should fine for swearing  Our author therefore scrupled to employ  Your vulgar  damme Sir  and  damme boy    Nay when by chance a naughty joke came pat in  He wrapt it up you know in lawyer's Latin  Alluding to a passage in the play which the Author in deference to the delicacy of certain Ladies who understand Latin has omitted    So much refin'd the scene since former days  When Congreve Vanbrugh Wycherly wrote plays  "The stage so loosely did Astrea tread  "She fairly put all characters to bed  Tho' now no bard would venture to deposit  A Macaroni in a lady's closet  Lest the srail fair one he be thought to ruin  While moon and stars alonesee what they're doing  In the old plays gallants take no denial  But put the struggling actress to the trial  Bess me I shudder ev'n now to think  How near ev'n I may stand on dangers brink  In modern plays more safe the female station  Secure as sad our solemn situation  No rakish forward spark dares now be rude  The Comic Muse herself grown quite a prude  No wonder then if in so pure an age  No  Congreves  write for as demure a stage
