what flow'ry Mead  Thy tender Flocks with wanton Pleasure feed  Where does my Dear my lovely Wand'rer stray  Tell me and guide my weary Steps that Way  In vain I trace the Plains each winding Grove  No Swain directs me to my absent Love  Close in the Covert of some Shade he lyes  Some envious Shade conceals him from my Eyes  Bear then my soft Complainings to his Ear  Ye whis'pring Winds let him my Accents hear  The wellknown Sounds will wake the ling'ring Swain  And bring him panting to my Arms again  Alas not yet my cruel Love returns  I rave my Breast with jealous Fury burns  Cold Tremblings seize on ev'ry vital Part  The Blood runs freezing to my panting Heart  Dim Shadows swim before my closing Sight  And my griev'd Soul prepares to take its Flight  Hark what sweet Accents breaks the ambient Air  Sure 'tis my Love's melodious Voice I hear  Now to my Arms my charming Shepherd flies  Heaven to my Arms and Transport to my Eyes  Oh on thy panting Breast let me recline  And let thy folding Arms around me twine  With Vows of Love my anxious Fears controul  And whisper Ease to my distracted Soul  Arise my Love the dear Enslaver cries  My beauteous Maid my lovely Fair arise  For lo the Rain is o'er the Winter's past  And balmy Sweets perfume the southern Blast  Like thee all Nature smiles the Fields around  Are with a new returning Verdure crown'd  Hark what sweet Musick fills the vocal Grove  Each feather'd Songster tunes its Notes to Love  What Odours do these op'ning Buds exhale  Yet cannot o'er thy greater Sweets prevail  Or their enchanting Beauties thine excell  That Lilly shines but with a borrow'd Grace  And Roses blush to emulate thy Face  Nor can the Violet's admired Dye  Match the bright Azure of thy shining Eye  See where you tread fresh blooming Flowers arise  New Charms appear where'er you turn your Eyes  For thee the Streams in softer Murmurs flow  For thee sweet Airs the whisp'ring  Zephirs  blow  For thee the Cedars form a grateful Shade  And brighter Colours paint th' enamell'd Mead  Oh come then thro' these sweet  Meanders  stray  Arise my Love my fair One come away  Yes dearest Object of my soft Desire  Thou sweet Inspirer of my endless Fire  With thee I'll trace the Groves each winding Mead  And follow where thy charming Footsteps lead  Yet let me view thee on that lovely Face  Let me with fond extatic Rapture gaze  Let thy Voice charm me with its Magick Sound  And my fond Soul with thrilling Pleasure wound  For sweet's thy Beauties to my ravish'd Sight  And thy dear Voice my list'ning Ears delight  See on that Couch with Nature's Bounties spread  At Ease reclin'd my lovely Shepherd's laid  What Beauties in that smiling Form appear  How soft how mild how more than heavenly fair  Ye tender Virgins awful Silence keep  Ye sighing Gales prolong his balmy Sleep  Thou sleep'st my Love but still thy waking Heart  Bears in my soft Inquietudes a Part  My Image ever present with thee seems  Haunts all thy Slumbers and informs thy Dreams  In ev'ry Wish in ev'ry Thought I'm thine  And oh be thou for ever ever mine  Behold he wakes and here with Transport flies  What streaming Glories sparkle from his Eyes  Oh turn them from me hide their beauteous Beams  The Sun with less refulgent Brightness gleams  Do not such sweet such magick Rays dispence  Like pow'rful Sweets they overcome my Sense  Oh set me as a Seal upon thy Heart  Mark'd for my own I claim the smallest Part  Shou'dst Thou but sure the wounding Thought is vain  For any other lovely Maid complain  Take from me Heav'n the fleeting Breath you gave  For Love's as strong as Death and pow'rful as the Grave  THE RIVAL NYMPHS A TALE  CLarissa  blest with ev'ry Grace  A Shape divine and charming Face  Had triumph'd long o'er many a Swain  And oft' been woo'd but woo'd in vain  Not so  Amanda  blooming Youth  Soft Innocence and artless Truth  Were all the Beauties she cou'd boast  Not form'd by Nature for a Toast  Yet some there were who in her Mind  A thousand nameless Charms cou'd find  She lov'd not Visits Park or Play  But mop'd and read her Time away  Insensible to a Degree  Her Heart was all her own and free  Yet oft of Love's soft pleasing Pains  The Nymph wou'd write in melting Strains  The lambent Flame that warm'd her Breast  Each tender flowing Line confess'd  Moneses  whose enchanting Form  Was one continu'd endless Charm  To whom indulgent Heav'n had join'd  All that cou'd beautify a Mind  Had often own'd bright Beauty's Power  Had sigh'd and lov'd for half an Hour  But yet the lovely Youth confess'd  Whoe'er could wound his destin'd Breast  Her Charms must over Time prevail  Her Wit must please when Beauty fail'd  Yet since he cou'd not hope to find  One blest with all those Charms of Mind  He thought  Clarissa  worth his Care  And all the Hours he had to spare  Soft Vows and tender speaking Eyes  Pleading Looks and melting Sighs  Make the believing Maid approve  His false but well dissembled Love  But while  Clarissa  's Charms he own'd  He with a secret Passion burn'd  Amanda  found the Way to win  His Heart and let her Image in  His Pain the lovely Youth conceals  All but what his Eyes reveals  His Eyes that all his Passion tell  And speak the Love he felt so well  Amanda  heard the Youth complain  She heard and felt an equal Flame  But still with native Shyness arm'd  She shuns the lovely Swain she charm'd  His Looks his Sighs his Actions move  And in soft Language plead for Love  Clarissa  still exults and cries  He's yet a Victim to my Eyes  He neither will nor can be free  Me he still love's and only Me  Ah cease to claim my charming Prize  Amanda  to the Fair replies  Cou'd I  Clarissa  cou'd I boast  The Hearts that to thy Charms are lost  With Joy I wou'd them all resign  To keep my lov'd  Moneses  mine  In vain the Nymph declares her Flame  Clarissa  still asserts her Claim  And 'till the lov'd  Moneses  owns  The conqu'ring Maid for whom he burns  'Till he'll the happy Fair unfold  The Sequel must remain untold  TO A LADY Singing  STILL sing bright Maid nor cease the pleasing Charm  Each Soul subdue each tender Bosom warm  Such magick Sweetness to thy Voice is giv'n  We hear a Seraph and we taste of Heav'n  Strange force of Harmony whose Power controuls  The warring Passions and informs our Souls  Soft soothing Sounds by whose enchantment blest  Anger and Grief forsake the tranquil Breast  While soft Ideas rising in the Mind  Bids us in Love a gentle Tyrant find  And to his Sway the softned Soul's resign'd  Thus sung the  Thracian  Bard while all around  The list'ning Beasts confess'd the magick Sound  Less sweet the Harmony  Amphion  made  When dancing Stones mov'd to the Notes he play'd  Or him who bore by Dolphins to the Shore  Made Winds and Waves confess his magick Pow'r  Thou no less pow'rful o'er the Human Mind  As great a Triumph from thy Songs can find  Love and its pleasing Pains at once inspire  And fix in ev'ry Breast the latent Fire  A HYMN to  VENUS  IN IMITATION of  SAPHO  VENUS Queen of tender Fires  Pleasing Pains and soft Desires  Sweet Enslaver of the Heart  Here thy gentle Aid impart  To my mourning Soul give Ease  And bid my soft Complainings cease  II  Hither beauteous Goddess move  Leave a while th'  Idalian  Grove  Once more to my transported Breast  Come a mild a grateful Guest  There confirm thy pleasing Reign  Free from Cares and free from Pain  III  Oh if e'er my artless Strains  By Thee inspired breath'd thy Pains  Propitious now thy Suppliant hear  And grant a Lover's ardent Pray'r  Ah let me not despairing mourn  But meet a kind a wish'd Return  IV  Make  Philander  feel my Pow'r  Fear my Scorn my Smiles adore  Let the dear Deceiver know  All the Pains he can bestow  To me that valued Heart resign  And fix the lovely Wand'rer mine  AMINTA and DELIA A PASTORAL  AMINTA  THEE gentle Maid may ev'ry Muse inspire  And  Phoebus  bless Thee with poetic Fire  May thy soft Numbers ev'ry Bosom warm  Melt into Love and into Softness charm  Around our peaceful Plains thy Praise is spread  And Wreaths of Laurel crown thy youthful Head  DELIA  May ev'ry Grace and blooming Charm be thine  And the dear Joys of Peace and Friendship mine  Aminta  still my grateful Heart shall share  Tho' lov'd  Philander  's Image triumphs there  AMINTA  Me gentle  Damon  loves nor loves in vain  With Joy I hear the charming Youth complain  He only he to Tenderness can move  Melt my soft Soul and charm me into Love  In vain I wou'd my secret Pain disguise  He reads my Passion in my artless Eyes  DELIA  From Fair to Fair the gay  Philander  rov'd  Sigh'd without Cause and for a Moment lov'd  The charming Wanderer no more I fear  For me he feels the tender Flame sincere  AMINTA  Soft as the Breeze which fans the silent Grove  Are  Damon  's Accents when he talk  of Love  Too well my fond consenting Looks reveal  The tender Passion I wou'd fain conceal  Whene'er I hear the lovely Youth complain  My Sighs and Blushes speak an equal Flame  DELIA  With skilful Hand when my  Philander  plays  And sings alternately in melting Lays  The Woods to the soft Harmony resound  And my Soul dwells on the enchanting Sound  AMINTA  When my lov'd  Damon  sings how sweet the Strains  Ecchoes repeat them to the distant Plains  Not  Philomela  thro' the whisp'ring Trees  Like that dear Shepherd's tuneful Voice can please  DELIA  No Arts I use to vex my faithful Swain  Nor feign a Passion nor affect Disdain  When the dear Youth in plaintive Sounds wou'd move  My yielding Soul to Tenderness and Love  He sees too well the struggling Passions rise  Glow in my Cheeks and Languish in my Eyes  Knows the soft Meaning of each Look and steals  The tender Thoughts which Art in vain conceals  AMINTA  When  Damon  's absent from my longing Eyes  A thousand anxious Fears and Sorrows rise  While to the Murmurs of you falling Stream  I sing and  Damon  is the charming Theme  DELIA  The lovely Object of my soft Desire  Philander  only can my Songs inspire  For him my Numbers flow my Shepherd's Praise  Adorns each Line and smooths my artless Lays  ENVY A SATIRE  IN  Yk  's detested Isle that Foe to Fame  That Bane of Glory and a virtuous Name  Pale Envy dwells and ev'ry Breast inspires  With mortal Hatred and destructive Fires  Enthron'd She sits with snaky Honours crown'd  And deals her impious Power all around  Deceit on one hand stands with cruel Smiles  Dissembled Truths and soft successful Wiles  But in her Hand tho' half conceal'd is view'd  The pointed Dagger deep in Rage imbru'd  Scandal on t'other hand like Fame appears  Alike her Number both of Tongues and Ears  By these the fairest Reputation dies  And swift and sure the spreading Ruin flies  Round the fell Pow'r her anxious Votaries throng  Vain Age contemn'd and unreguarded Young  These who to Virtue Wit and Beauty lost  Here strive to blast the Fame they cannot boast  Goddess they cry if e'er thy Suppliants please  When Crowds they sacrifice to give thee Ease  To sooth thy Pains when some distinguish'd Name  Rises to blast thee with an honest Fame  If by the happy Force of fraudful Lies  Sunk in Oblivion the bright Merit dies  If spotless Chastity to Shame betray'd  If charms when blasted in the blooming Maid  Deserve thy Smilethe pleasing Mischief aid  Still GODDESS in our Souls thy Pow'r increase  And to each pointed Scandal give Success  Pleas'd she assents and now each lab'ring Breast  Is with the baneful Fury's Rage possess'd  Arm'd with deep Malice each reproachful Tongue  Murders the Fair the Innocent and Young  With doubtful Hints a horrid Sense convey  And smile a faultless Character away  But now  Artelia  comes with stealing Pace  Gentle her Air but Anguish clouds her Face  Merit uninjur'd now demands her Grief  But future Scandal gives her Soul relief  Swift thro' the supplicating Crowd she press'd  And her bad Pray'r in Whispers is address'd  Goddess who all my anxious Bosom fires  Who ev'ry Word and ev'ry Thought inspires  Still while thy potent Influence I feel  Let Friendship's soft Disguise my Aims conceal  And while I spread destructive Scandal round  Beneath that Masque let me securely wound  'Tis done 'tis granted fly ye virtuous Few  Fly e'er her cruel Arts your Fame pursue  See Justice from the foul Infection flies  And frighted hence reseeks her native Skies  Far from the guilty Scene averts her Sight  Her own  Philander  can't retard her Flight  Tho' her bright Image in his Breast he bears  And all her Beauties in his Form appears  Tho' in his Soul she lights her heav'nly Flame  And finds even here a Votary in him  TO  MONESES  Singing  BE hush'd as Death  Moneses  sings  Moneses  strikes the sounding Strings  Let sacred Silence dwell around  And nought disturb the Magick Sound  Let not the softly whisp'ring Breeze  Sob amidst the rustling Trees  Murmur ye plaintive Streams no more  But glide in Silence to the Shore  Even  Philomel  thy Note suspend  And to a sweeter Song attend  Ah soft ah dang'rous pow'rful Charm  An Angel's Voice an Angel's Form  Attentive to the heav'nly Lay  I hear and gaze my Soul away  Now tender Wishes melting Fires  Infant Pains and young Desires  Steal into my softned Soul  And bend it to the sweet Controul  Yet let me fly e'er 'tis too late  The sweet Disease and shun my Fate  But ah that softly dying Strain  Arrests my Steps I strive in vain  Again I to the Syren turn  Again with gentle Fires I burn  Cease lovely Youth th' inchanting Sound  Too deep already is the Wound  Thro' all my Veins the Poison steals  My Heart the dear Infection feels  I faint I die by love opprest  The Sigh scarce heaves my panting Breast  Before my View dim Shadows rise  And hides Thee from my ravish'd Eyes  Thy Voice like distant Sounds I hear  It dies in murmurs on my Ear  In the too pow'rful Transport tost  Ev'n Thought and ev'ry Sense is lost  THE LANGUAGE of the EYES TO LADY  J F  I  IF forc'd by Tyrant Custom we  The Anguish of our Souls conceal  Our Eyes yet boast their Liberty  Let them the tender Truths reveal  In soft persuasive Glances speak our Grief  And from that silent Language find Relief  II  Those sweet Betrayers of the Mind  Can always lend their welcome Aid  The Thoughts by harsh Restraint confin'd  By them are all to View betray'd  The doubtful War which Hope and Fear maintain'd  Are by those charming Orators explain'd  III  See Anger in that sparkling Eye  This in soft Shades of Sorrow drest  Love smiling Hope and tender Joy  In those inchanting Looks exprest  The conqu'ring Eyes correct the Lover's Heart  And as they Smile or Frown their Hopes and Fears impart  IV  Ye Fair who strive with Darts to arm  The languid Beauties of your Eyes  Of  Isabellas  learn to charm  Like hers the ravish'd Soul surprize  Her Mind does all their glorious Beams dispense  Bright as they are they owe their Rays to Sense  To  AURELIA  on her attempting to write Verses  LONG had  Aurelia  vainly strove  To write in melting Strains of Love  Ambitious of a Poet's Name  She wept she sigh'd she long'd for Fame  While of the great Design possest  She thus the  Delian  God addrest  Brightest of heavenly Powers above  Immortal Son of thund'ring  Jove    Oh glorious Deity impart  To me the soft poetic Art  Vouchsafe to me thy sacred Fire  And with thyself my Soul inspire  She spakethe God indulgent hears  The beauteous Maid and grants her Prayers  On  Clio  turns his radiant Eyes  And to the tuneful Goddess cries  Fly hence to fair  Aurelia  's Aid  In heavenly Strains instruct the Maid  The Muse obeys the God's Commands  With Joy and swift as Thought descends  And at  Aurelia  's Side attends  Conscious of her new Power the Maid  With Thanks the glorious Gift repay'd  Now  Waller  's Sweetness  Granville  's Fire  At once her tuneful Breast inspire  No more she vainly strives to please  The ready Numbers flow with ease  All soft harmonious and divine  Apollo shines in every Line  The  Delian  God with Rapture fill'd  Upon his lovely Pupil smil'd  Daphne  his oncelov'd charming Care  Appear'd to him not half so fair  For the lost Nymph he mourns no more  Nor in his Songs her Loss deplore  But from the slighted Tree he tears  It's Leaves to deck  Aurelia  's Hairs  A Poet now by all she's own'd  And with immortal Honour crown'd  ON A LADY's Singing  HOW was I charm'd when fair  Harmonia  sung  What heavenly Sweetness dwelt upon her Tongue  What melting Joys did her soft Song impart  Oh Pow'r of Musick on a tender Heart  While she repeats the Lover's ardent Pains  My sympathising Soul with her complains  Soft flow the Tears the gentle Sorrows rise  And my full Bosom heaves with strug'ling Sighs  But when a faithful generous Pair's her Theme  When in soft Sounds she sings their mutual Flame  'Tis then I feel the Lover's soft Excess  Share in their Joy and triumph in their Bliss  Wish I may thus to Tenderness be moved  And love like them like them to be belov'd  Oh say bright Virgin by what powerful Art  Thy Song gives real Raptures to the Heart  And makes the struggling Soul alternate prove  The Joys of true and Pangs of perjur'd Love  A Voice less fine than yours the Bard possest  Whose magick Sweetness moving Trees confest  On Mortals thy superior Skill is shown  And Hearts subdu'd thy greater Power own  To  FLAVIA  An ODE  I  IF  Flavia  in thy faultless Form  All that is Heavenlyfair we find  If every Grace conspires to charm  And speaks the Beauties of thy Mind  II  Why shouldst thou wonder lovely Maid  At the soft Passions you inspire  Why those to hopeless Love betray'd  Or these feel Friendship's sacred Fire  III  Heedless thy charming Eyes enslave  Nor know the smiling Deaths they dart  Nought can the wretched Gazer save  Or rescue his devoted Heart  IV  But ah to win the Soul is more  And Friendship's nobler Fires impart  The Work of some diviner Power  And Reason wings th' unerring Dart  V  Let thy Adorers justly praise  The wond'rous Beauties of thy Face  Extol thy Charms a thousand Ways  And with thy Name their Numbers grace  VI  Friendship a nobler Theme shall find  And to th' admiring World display  The Graces that adorn thy Mind  A Subject that will ne'er decay  VII  When thy bright Eyes shall cease to wound  And Age thy fading Charms embrace  When in thy Looks no trace is found  Of what the lovely  Flavia  was  VIII  The lasting Beauties of thy Mind  The Muse in gentle Strains shall sing  In thy fair Soul new Charms shall find  To raise her Voice and prune her Wing  A SONG  I  WHAT Torments must the Virgin prove  That feels the Pangs of hopeless Love  What endless Cares must rack the Breast  That is by sure Despair possest  II  When Love in tender Bosoms reigns  With all its soft its pleasing Pains  Why should it be a Crime to own  The fatal Flame we cannot shun  III  The Soul by Nature form'd sincere  A slavish forc'd Disguise must wear  Left the unthinking World reprove  The Heart that glows with generous Love  IV  But oh in vain the Sigh's represt  That gently heaves the pensive Breast  The glowing Blush the falling Tear  The conscious Wish and silent Fear  V  Ye soft Betrayers aid my Flame  And give my new Desires a Name  Some Power my gentle Griefs redress  Reveal or make my Passion less  On reading  HUTCHISON  on the  PASSIONS  THOU who thro' Nature's various Faults can rove  And shew what Springs the eager Passions move  Teach us to combat Anger Grief and Fear  Recal the Sigh and stop the falling Tear  Oh be thy soft Philosophy addrest  To the untroubled Ear and tranquil Breast  To these be all thy peaceful Notions taught  Who idly rove amidst a Calm of Thought  Whose Soul by Love or Hate were ne'er possest  Who ne'er were wretched and who ne'er were blest  Whose fainter Wishes Pleasures Fears remain  Dreams but of Bliss and Shadows of a Pain  Serenely stupid so some shallow Stream  Flows thro' the winding Valleys still the same  Whom no rude Wind can ever discompose  Who fears no Winter Rain or falling Snows  But slowly down its flow'ry Borders creeps  And the soft Zephyr on its Bosom sleeps  Oh couldst thou teach the tortur'd Soul to know  With Patience each Extream of human Woe  To bear with Ills and unrepining prove  The Frowns of Fortune and the Racks of Love  Still should my Breast some quiet Moments share  Still rise superior to each threatning Care  Nor fear approaching Ills or distant Woes  But in  Philander  's Absence find Repose  The  QUESTION  SINCE freed from Love's enchanting Pains  Your Heart no longer wears my Chains  Since the gay Folly charms no more  And all the dear Delusion's o'er  Yet tell me  Damon  do you prove  In Freedom Joys so pure as Love  Alike unfelt its Pains or Sweets  Your Heart an equal Measure beats  No longer Hope and Fear maintain  Within your Breast a doubtful Reign  Unpleas'd nor caring if you please  Lost in a dull inactive Ease  Since then for this you could forego  The Lover's sweetlypleasing Woe  Forsake those bright enliv'ning Fires  Gay Hopes and elegant Desires  The mutual Wish the equal Flame  The Sorrows Fears and Hopes the same  Oh say what Joys can Freedom boast  Like those sweet Torments you have lost  The ADVICE An ODE  I  BENEATH a Myrtle's spreading Shade  The sadly weeping  Delia  lay  Soft Zephyrs fann'd the pensive Maid  And wasted every Sigh away  II  Dear conscious Stream she softly cry'd  Whose plaintive Murmurs sooth my Pain  How often on thy flow'ry Side  Did  Damon  at my Feet complain  III  Reclin'd in yonder silent Grove  How did the lovely Youth protest  The softest truest fondest Love  That ever warm'd a faithful Breast  IV  But ah those Vows no longer bind  No more my gentle Sway he owns  For some coy Nymph less fair and kind  The dear Betrayer sighs and burns  V  Thus mourn'd the fair neglected Maid  When sprightly  Cloe  thither came  And is it thus she laughing said  That  Delia  cures a slighted Flame  VI  No more indulge this fruitless Grief  If  Damon  's false to you and Love  The God that wounds can bring Relief  Another may the first remove  VII  Believe me Friend the cruel Flame  Which tortures now thy gentle Breast  The Object chang'd will burn the same  And you in mutual Love be blest  VIII  Strephon  who all this Time conceal'd  The Virgin's soft Complaints had heard  His beauteous Form at length reveal'd  And thus his tender Vows preferr'd  IX  If Love like mine that can endure  Tho' the dear Object be its Foe  If Absence nor Disdain can cure  A hopeless Flame that burns in Woe  X  If such a pure a constant Fire  May hope for Pity in thy Breast  Strephon  shall still the Heart inspire  That once receiv'd him for a Guest  XI  Delia  no more my Love shall fly  But with returning Fondness own  That  Damon  merits less than I  Who never lov'd but her alone  XII  Amaz'd confus'd the blushing Maid  Found her wrong'd Lover still the same  In vain she call'd her Pride to aid  Against the sweet returning Flame  XIII  That melting Voice that heavenly Form  Those Eyes that shone with soft Desire  Each Grace inspires her Soul to charm  And kindle up the latent Fire  XIV  Fain she'd her tender Thoughts impart  Her bashful Tongue the Task denies  Impatient to be known her Heart  Gives all its Softness to her Eyes  XV  In them soft Wishes stood confest  Sweet Remorse and conscious Love  Every Fear her Soul possest  And all that cou'd those Fears remove  XVI  Convinc'd o'erjoy'd the lovely Youth  Saw the reluctant pleasing Pain  Vows at her Feet eternal Truth  Blesses her Sway and hugs his Chain  ARDELIA  to  FLAVIA  An EPISTLE  THOU dearest Object of my fondest Love  What Words can speak the Misery I prove  Doom'd as I am by my relentless Fate  To bear the worst of dreaded Ills your Hate  Lov'd tho' thou wert in every Action just  Have I not wrong'd thee by unkind Distrust  Believ'd thee false when Love and Truth were thine  And all the tender Joys of Friendship mine  Wretch that I am my fatal Crime I know  And merit all the Anger you can show  Do hate me loath me drive me from your Breast  That Seat of Softness Innocence and Rest  Bid me my fatal Rashness ever mourn  Fly my loath'd Sight and curse me with your Scorn  But oh tho' Anger should each Grace transform  And change to Roughness every smiling Charm  Tho' those bright Eyes where Love and Sweetness shine  Shou'd with the coldest Glances look on mine  Tho' that harmonious that enchanting Tongue  Where all the Force of soft Perswasion hung  Chide me in cruel Sounds with Fury warm'd  And wound the Ears it has so often charm'd  Still wou'd I bear it all with Patience bear  And whisper to my Soul your Triumph there  But sure in Pity to my tender Pains  Some Spark of Friendship in thy Breast remains  To that I'll sue the languid Flame to raise  And wake the sleeping Passion to a Blaze  Try every Art thy Anger to controul  And watch each yielding Moment in thy Soul  Some tender Fit of Softness in thy Breast  When Love's awake and Anger charm'd to Rest  For sure my  Flavia  cannot always prove  Deaf to the tender Prayers and Tears of Love  Oh teach me thou fair Softness to atone  For all the Wrongs I've to thy Friendship done  With thy own Sweetness thy just Rage disarm  And learn me all thy wellknown Power to charm  Direct me how to make my Vows believ'd  To move thy Pity and thy Love retrieve  Oh with returning Ardour ever bless  The Heart which you and only you possess  An  ODE To SLEEP  I  COME gentle God of soft Repose  And charm my Soul to Rest  In thy Embraces let me lose  The Cares that rack my Breast  II  Arise ye dear Deceits arise  And drest in  Damon  's Form  My longexpecting wishing Eyes  With his Resemblance charm  III  Those melting Sounds still let me hear  Which did his Flame impart  Which blest with Love my list'ning Ear  And pierc'd my yielding Heart  IV  Why rove my Thoughts on fancied Bliss  Which only Dreams bestow  For oh whene'er the Morn appears  I wake to real Woe  V  The envious Light from my sad Eyes  Drives all my Bliss away  With Night the lovely Phantom flies  And leaves me lost in Day  VI  Since waking then I am distrest  And Pleasure's fled with him  If sleeping I can still be blest  Let Life be all a Dream  An  ODE IN IMITATION  of  SAPHO  I  ME the loveliest truest Swain  Often woo's but woo's in vain  Tender soft beseeching Eyes  Pleading Tears and melting Sighs  Such soft Pains as Lovers feel  Such his dying Looks reveal  II  Yet by Pride by Shame withheld  Every yielding Thought's repell'd  Scarce the Sigh that heaves my Breast  Scarce the falling Tear's represt  Yet may artful Tongue denies  My Love and contradicts my Eyes  III  If then charming Youth you'd know  All my Love and all my Woe  All my Heart without Disguise  Read it in my artless Eyes  They'll in tender Language tell  What I wou'd in vain conceal  IV  There each yielding Thought betray'd  All my Hopes add Fears display'd  The soft Flame which warms my Breast  In each melting Look's confest  While unstudied Glances prove  All is Truth and all is Love  A SONG  I  DAMON  in vain you strive to move  'Tis true my Heart was form'd for Love  And own its native Flame  But such a Flame so pure a Fire  Philander  only can inspire  And all its Softness claim  II  No more of cruel Scorn complain  Too late alas you own'd your Pain  Too late to find a Cure  If Friendship to your Views be due  Taste all the Ease that can bestow  But  Damon  ask no more  A PARODY ON AN ODE of  HORACE  As TRANSLATED by Mr  FARQUHAR  IN Love where Cares distract the Mind  Where Fear to smiling Hope is join'd  Where Grief the longsought Joy precedes  And late Remorse that Joy invades  Show me among the happiest there  Who would not wish for Freedom here  In Freedom Friend the Wise delights  For this the Curtaintutor'd Nights  For this she storms the peaceful Man  And curses nuptial Ties in vain  Since Love then is too weak to cure  That female Vice the Thirst of Power  Happy the Maid who guards her Heart  Against the sweetlypainful Dart  Who charm'd by Liberty alone  Will no intruding Passion own  In Love what can we hope to find  But Pleasures that leave Stings behind  Delusive Hopes of Happiness  Airy Dreams of fancy'd Bliss  Which shadowlike will disappear  When the approaching Form comes near  Cease then to court a certain Ill  If free at present keep so still  Forbear that meaning Glance to throw  The Dart which meditates the Foe  May back upon thyself recoil  And catch thee in the artful Toil  Love o'er the abject Breast may reign  With all its light fantastic Train  Of Wishes Cares and fond Desires  Fears and Hopes and jealous Fires  Be mine from the soft Folly free  Freedom alone has Charms for me  The DREAM  AH stay fair fleeting Form I charge thee stay  Whither ah whither wouldst thou glide away  Ardelia  calls thee lovely cruel Shade  Ardelia  bids thee stay thy once lov'd Maid  Alas in vain I call for see he flies  Flies my fond clasping Arms and ardent Eyes  Not all my Prayers can the lov'd Form detain  My Sighs my Tears my Wishes are in vain  In gentle Slumbers  Morpheus  close my Eyes  And bid once more the lovely Phantom rise  Bid him in all those heavenly Charms appear  That melting Softness that engaging Air  In that too powerful Sorrow let him shine  When first he gave his Heart and conquer'd mine  Hence then ye Sorrows from the fancied Scene  Despairs eternal Sighs and secret Pain  Shall wound no more no Thought my Bliss destroy  No happy Rival interrupt my Joy  For oh whate'er my cruel Fates Design  In Sleep  Philander  can be only mine  A SONG  I  IN Vain I strive with Female Art  To hide the Motions of my Heart  My Eyes my secret Flame declare  And  Damon  reads his Triumph there  II  When from his fond his ardent Gaze  With Frowns I turn aside my Face  My Cheeks with conscious Blushes glow  And all my Soul's Disorder show  III  Or when with seeming Scorn I hear  The Youth his tender Vows prefer  From my fond Breast reluctant steals  A Sigh and all the Truth reveals  IV  Oh Love allpowerful o'er the Mind  Art thou to rigid rules confin'd  And must the Heart that owns thy Sway  That Tyrant Customs Laws obey  V  Oh let me break the cruel Chain  And freely own my tender Pain  By harsh Restraint no longer sway'd  Confirm whate'er my Eyes have said  The  ART  of  COQUETTRY  YE lovely Maids whose yet unpractis'd Hearts  Ne'er felt the Force of Love's resistless Darts  Who justly set a Value on your Charms  Power all your Wish but Beauty all your Arms  Who o'er Mankind wou'd fain exert your Sway  And teach the lordly Tyrant to obey  Attend my Rules to you alone addrest  Deep let them sink in every female Breast  The Queen of Love herself my Bosom fires  Assists my Numbers and my Thoughts inspires  Me she instructed in each secret Art  How to enslave and keep the vanquish'd Heart  When the stol'n Sigh to heave or drop the Tear  The melting Languish the obliging Fear  Halfstifled Wishes broken kind Replies  And all the various Motions of the Eyes  To teach the Fair by different Ways to move  The soften'd Soul and bend the Heart to Love  Proud of her Charms and conscious of her Face  The haughty Beauty calls forth every Grace  With fierce Defiance throws the killing Dart  By Force she wins by Force she keeps the Heart  The witty Fair on nobler Game pursues  Aims at the Head but the rapt Soul subdues  The languid Nymph enslaves with softer Art  With sweet Neglect she steals into the Heart  Slowly she moves her swimming Eyes around  Conceals her Shaft but meditates the Wound  Her gentle Languishments the Gazers move  Her Voice is Musick and her Looks are Love  Tho' not to all Heaven does these Gifts impart  What's theirs by Nature may be yours by Art  But let your Airs be suited to your Face  Nor to a Languish tack a sprightly Grace  The short round Face brisk Eyes and auburn Hair  Must smiling Joy in every Motion wear  Her quick unsettled Glances deal around  Hide her Design and seem by Chance to wound  Dark rolling Eyes a Languish may assume  And tender Looks and melting Airs become  The pensive Head upon the Hand reclin'd  As if some sweet Disorder fill'd the Mind  Let the heav'd Breast a struggling Sigh restrain  And seem to stop the falling Tear with Pain  The Youth who all the soft Distress believes  Soon wants the kind Compassion which he gives  But Beauty Wit and Youth may sometimes fail  Nor always o'er the stubborn Soul prevail  Then let the fair One have recourse to Art  And if not vanquish undermine the Heart  First from your artful Looks with studious Care  From mild to grave from tender to severe  Oft on the careless Youth your Glances dart  A tender Meaning let each Look impart  Whene'er he meets your Looks with modest Pride  And soft Confusion turn your Eyes aside  Let a soft Sigh steal out as if by Chance  Then cautious turn and steal another Glance  Caught by these Arts with Pride and Hope elate  The destin'd Victim rushes on his Fate  Pleas'd his imagin'd Victory pursues  And the kind Maid with soften'd Glances views  Contemplates now her Shape her Air her Face  And thinks each Feature wears an added Grace  'Till Gratitude which first his Bosom proves  By slow Degrees is ripen'd into Love  'Tis harder still to fix than gain a Heart  What's won by Beauty must be kept by Art  Too kind a Treatment the blest Lover cloys  And oft Despair the growing Flame destroys  Sometimes with Smiles receive him sometimes Tears  And wisely balance both his Hopes and Fears  Perhaps he mourns his illrequited Pains  Condemns your Sway and strives to break his Chains  Behaves as if he now your Scorn defy'd  And thinks at least he shall alarm your Pride  But with Indifference view the seeming Change  And let your Eyes after new Conquests range  While his torn Breast with jealous Fury burns  He hopes despairs hates and adores by Turns  With Anguish now repents the weak Deceit  And powerful Passion bears him to your Feet  Strive not the jealous Lover to perplex  Ill suits Suspension with that haughty Sex  Rashly they judge and always think the worst  And Love is often banish'd by Distrust  To these an open free Behaviour wear  Avoid Disguise and seem at least sincere  Whene'er you meet affect a glad Surprize  And give unmelting Softness to your Eyes  By some unguarded Word your Love reveal  And anxiously the rising Blush conceal  By Arts like these the Jealous you deceive  Then most deluded when they most believe  But while in all you seek to raise Desire  Beware the fatal Passion you inspire  Each soft intruding Wish in Time reprove  And guard against the sweet Envader Love  Not for the tender were these Rules design'd  Who in their Faces show their yielding Mind  Eyes that a native Languishment can wear  Whose Smiles are artless and whose Blush sincere  But the gay Nymph who Liberty can prize  And vindicate the Triumph of her Eyes  Who o'er Mankind a haughty Rule maintains  Whose Wit can manage what her Beauty gains  Such by these Arts their Empire may improve  And what they lost by Nature gain by Love  To  MIRA  Inviting her to a RETREAT in the COUNTRY  NOW Spring returning decks the Year  With all that's lovely all that's fair  The Fields in lively Green array'd  With deeper Glooms the silent Shade  Soft descends the gentle show'rs  And wakes to Life the springing Flow'rs  Hence ambrosial Sweets exhale  And various Colours paint the Vale  Refreshing Airs the Zephyrs blow  The Streams with pleasing Murmurs flow  While nightly 'midst the silent Plain  Thy fav'rite Bird renews her Strain  Come then my  Mira  come and share  My Joys and breath a purer Air  Together let us range the Plains  Amongst the rustick Nmyphs and Swains  In rural Dress devoid of Cure  Give to the Winds our flowing Hair  And round the Meadows gayly roam  For Youth does sober Mirth become  Now straining up you airy Height  We'll entertain the wand'ring Sight  With flow'ry Fields and waving Woods  Hills and Dales and falling Floods  Or to relieve the searching Eyes  See distant Spires and Temples rise  Come now my  Mira  let us rove  Together thro' the mazy Grove  Here while with gentle Pace we walk  Beguile the Time with pleasing Talk  Here show thy melting Eloquence  Thy sprightly Wit thy manly Sense  Thy virtuous Notions void of Art  And while you charm correct the Heart  Or now together careless laid  Beneath a Cypress spreading Shade  Our Thoughts to heavenly Numbers raise  Repeating  Pope  's harmonious Lays  Now  Homer  's awful Leaves turn o'er  Or graver History explore  Or study  Plato  's sacred Page  Uncommon to our Sex and Age  Now wand'ring by the Moon's pale Light  Amidst the silent Shades of Night  Where on the late deserted Plains  A pleasing Melancholy reigns  Softly thro' the rustling Trees  Sobs the sweetly dying Breeze  The Echo's catch the plaintive Sound  And gentle Murmurs breathe around  Now sing my Friend and let thy Strain  Recount the Arts of faithless Man  Thy Notes sweet  Philomel  shall join  And mix her soft Complaints with thine  But raise my  Mira  raise thy Song  To Friendship nobler Strains belong  Oh sing its tender chaste Desires  Its equal pure and lasting Fires  Such as in thy Bosom burns  Such as my fond Soul returns  Friendship is but Love refin'd  Not weakens but exalts the Mind  And when its sacred Power we prove  We guess how heavenly Spirits love  Verses wrote extempore on a Gentleman's playing on the Flute  I  OH cease thy too harmonious Strain  Nor thus my ravish'd Soul surprize  What new Ideas pleasing Pains  Does by the sweet Inchantment rise  II  Lull'd by the dear bewitching Sound  Each jarring Passion's charm'd to rest  Yet my Soul feels a pleasing Wound  And sweet Disorders fill my Breast  III  Forbear to show thy heavenly Art  Nor aim a Conquest o'er my Mind  By Musick soften'd to the Dart  Love may an easy Entrance find  An EPISTLE TO  MONESES  IN IMITATION of OVID  WHEN urg'd by Honour from thy Sight I flew  And scarce would breath one tender soft adieu  From thy dear Face I turn'd my gazing Eyes  Supprest the Tears and check'd the rising Sighs  Selfbanish'd all Despairs worst Pangs I prove  I fled from you but could not fly from Love  Oh do not then my lovely Swain accuse  My Want of Truth nor charge on me thy Woes  For every Pain which racks thy faithful Breast  A thousand more my anxious Soul opprest  Sorrows for which Description's all too faint  And equal Misery alone can paint  Dearer than Light to these fond Eyes you are  My first my last and still my only Care  My hapless Flame nor Time nor Absence cures  Still constant to the Vows which made me yours  Ah why then in that sadlypleasing Strain  Why does  Moneses  of his Wrongs complain  Forbear to send me what thy Muse inspir'd  By illrequited Love and Absence fir'd  Deep in my Soul thy soft Reproaches steal  And all thy Griefs redoubled there I feel  Still round my Heart plays the same lambient Flame  Each Wish and every fond Desire the same  Nor can thy Pen one piercing Woe reveal  Which thy  Ardelia  does not equal feel  Ah dear Idea of my lovely Swain  Ah soft Remembrance of my former Pain  Why to my anxious Breast do you return  Why wake a Flame which must for ever burn  Still shall that lovely Image charm my View  And those dear Accents all my Grief renew  Still must I love tho' Honour Love deny  And bids me from the dangerous Charmer fly  Ah then how vain how fruitless all my Care  This welcome Absence this confirm'd Despair  This cruel Contest between Love and Fame  These endless Pangs for which I want a Name  Why does  Moneses  still love on Why share  In all those Sorrows I alone should bear  All tender as thou wert all soft and kind  I flew and with thee left my Soul behind  I left thee fancied Honour to pursue  Just to myself but more unjust to you  Why then my Image dost thou still retain  Why for a Wretch unworthy thee complain  O rather hate me drive me from your Breast  By Scorn and Hate be all thy Soul possest  Let thy fond Heart thy oncelov'd Chains resign  Compleat thy Cure and O assist in mine  Why did I love Why did my easy Heart  Admit the dear but ah too dangerous Dart  Why did I not the pleasing Torment shun  Why fondly listen to the pleasing Tongue  Quick to my Heart the subtle Poison stole  Charm'd all my Senses and enslav'd my Soul  And less the Beauty of thy matchless Form  Then thy prevailing Eloquence could charm  Oh come once more  Moneses  and renew  Those tender Vows and I'll believe them true  Let me once more behold those melting Eyes  Where Love a thousand nameless Charms supplies  The soft Enchantment shall my Fears controul  And Love claim all his Empire in my Soul  Ah whether would my boundless Wishes rove  Still still am I enslav'd by guilty Love  Still shall its lawless Fires my Soul profane  And is my boasted Virtue but a Name  No I'll forget thee drive thee from my Breast  Thou dear Undoer of my Peace and Rest  Yet how forget when every Thought is thine  Even Life itself were easier to resign  To lonely Shades in vain I fly for Ease  There secret sigh and feed the sweet Disease  On thy dear Name I call and all around  The whisp'ring Winds repeat the charming Sound  'Tis thus I wear the anxious Hours away  'Till Night restores the Sorrows of the Day  Then does thy Image to my Eyes appear  But ah with Looks averse and Frowns severe  Still as you seem to chide me with your Eyes  My own in streaming Tears to yours replies  Oh stay I cry thou charming Phantom stay  Or with thee take my fleeting Soul away  In vain I call my clasping Arms you shun  And waking find the dear Delusion gone  Thus does  Ardelia  hunt thy boding Dream  Does she like thee all cold and cruel seem  Or does the pensive Shade soft Sorrows wear  Heave the faint Sigh and shed the mimick Tear  On thy lov'd Breast her painful Head recline  And tell thee that her Torments equal thine  Why can I not this fatal Flame remove  Or why O why is it a Crime to love  By Turns my Reason and my Passion sway  As Honour triumphs and as Love betray  My tortur'd Breast conflicting Passions tear  And Love and Virtue wage unequal War  Now all its sacred Precepts I pursue  Lost for a while is every Thought of you  But oh again the guilty Lover burns  And all the Woman in my Soul returns  Again my Bosom glows with soft Desire  And hope returning fans the fatal Fire  Seas rolls between us but the active Mind  Still springs to thee and leaves its load behind  Oh should some happy Chance to us unknown  Without a Crime confirm me all thy own  Blest be these tender Griefs these anxious Fears  These neverceasing Sighs and flowing Tears  Oh let my Soul the pleasing Hope retain  One Hour of Joy repays whole Years of Pain  To suff'ring Martyrs thus such Hopes are given  Such Views of promis'd Joys and future Heaven  For this resign'd they calmly meet their Fate  Conscious of Blessings in a happier State  An ODE  I  AH cease to grieve fond fluttering Heart  Thy charming Conqueror returns  Hence every Doubt each Fear depart  The Youth with equal Passion burns  II  Haste gentle Winds and waft him here  Nor long my lov'd  Philander  keep  Grant Queen of Love a Lover's Prayer  Sooth into Smiles thy native Deep  III  While I thy gentle Power address  View the dear Object of my Care  View him bright Goddess and confess  A lovelier  Adonis  there  IV  Then can my Vows be fruitless paid  When in that loveinspiring Form  Those melting Graces are display'd  Which your celestial Breast cou'd warm  V  Come then my Soul's Enslaver come  To these fond Eyes their Bliss restore  Be these encircling Arms thy Home  And fate shall never part us more  SONG  IN Vain I strive to fly  This Soul consuming Care  My Sorrows always nigh  And present every where  In vain I trace the Grove  There no Repose I find  What Place can banish Love  From the subjected Mind  That pensivefalling Stream  Those Gales that whisper round  Increase the fatal Flame  And deeper fix the Wound  The silent Shades of night  Adds Horror to my Grief  The gay Return of Light  To me brings no Relief  In Answer to Consolatory Verses wrote by a Friend  WITH Ease Advice to virtuous Woe we give  But ah how few by  Stoick  Rules can live  Virtue distrest in melting Verse appears  Beauteous in Misery and adorn'd in Tears  But in the World 'tis view'd with other Eyes  Virtue in Rags is Beauty in Disguise  And can no more Contempt and Scorn disarm  Then a fair Face behind a Masque can charm  Whatever Gifts we may to Nature owe  Success is all our Merit here below  By Fortune favour'd Fools may rise to Fame  Without it Virtue is an empty Name  SHALLUM  to  HILPAH  An EPISTLE From the  SPECTATOR  WHAT Thought can figure all my vast Distress  What Words the Anguish of my Soul express  When to my Rival you resign'd your Charms  And fill'd his richer but less faithful Arms  Loathing the Sun's bright Rays to Shades I fly  And your dear Name to whisp'ring Zephyrs sigh  The whisp'ring Zephyrs your dear Name reply  These threescore Years and ten thy Loss I've mourn'd  While  Tirzah  's Hills my loud Complaint return'd  Dark gloomy Groves to raise have been my Care  Fit Scenes of hopeless Love and black Despair  But now oh  Hilpah  Paradise appears  And a new  Eden  rises 'midst my Tears  Here opening Flowers the ravish'd Sense invade  There spreading Cedars form a grateful Shade  Soft gliding Streams which murmur as they flow  And Gales that all  Arabia  's Odours blow  Come up then my Belov'd Oh come and grace  This Spot of Earth with a young lovely Race  Let a fair num'rous Offspring fill each Shade  And anewpeopled World by thee be made  Remember fair One that the Age of Man  Is but a thousand Years and quickly gone  Beauty tho' much admir'd yet soon is past  Its transient Glories but some Centuries last  Like a tall Oak which long on  Tirzah  's Height  Display'd its growing Branches to the Sight  Now worn with Age it falls nor thought of more  Unless some Root its Memory restore  Which with increasing Verdure still may rise  And like its ParentTree invade the Skies  Think well on this then haste to make me blest  Be happy now and leave to Fate the rest  FINIS
