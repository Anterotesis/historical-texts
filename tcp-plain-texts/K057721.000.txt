 MORE WAYS THAN ONE A COMEDY AS ACTED AT THE  THEATRE ROYAL  IN COVENT GARDEN By MRS COWLEY  LONDON PRINTED BY J DAVIES CHANCERYLANE FOR T EVANS PATERNOSTERROW MDCCLXXXIV  DEDICATION  FLY comic scenes where distant Ganges laves  Hindostan's golden shores with hallow'd waves  Where palms gigantic rear their tufted heads  And nature in colossal vegetation spreads  Where rich ananas court the Indian's eye  And groves of citrons fan the fev'rish sky  Where rattling canes around the riv'lets play  And the centennial aloe drinks the day  In their deep shades bid Lucidorus smile  His heavy sense of  distant  hours beguile  Bid him not think because I gaily write  That heavy hours to him to me are light  My native spirits bounding from repose  Bear me unwilling where Castalia flows  I love to weep love the soft feast of grief  Court mournful thoughts nor ever wish relief  Sadness  I woo yet still the phantom flies  And  joy  seduces whilst I ask for sighs  But Hymen frowns and joy no longer cheers  Weeping I sinkThalia drinks my tears  He tears my heart she my rapt soul inspires  He chills with grief she fills me with her fires  Thus Lucidorus pass  my  distant hours  By turns subdued the slave of rival powers  And thus hath nature in my little frame  Still various been and variously the same  My heart so keenly feels 'twere death to live  Did not bright spirits its strong sense relieve  Through THESE capricious desultory gay  As though I felt not glides th' unconscious day  Through THIS I droop I sadden and complain  Dragging with pensive steps life's length'ning chain  In blithesome mood  "More Ways than One"  had birth  Offspring of brilliant morns and eves of mirth  The laughing muse in sprightliest vein was by  And "quips and cranks" lay lurking in her eye  O may her spirit from its pages dart  Dance o'er your nerves and live within your heart  H C  PROLOGUE  BY A CLERGYMAN  SPOKEN BY MR BONNER IN THE CHARACTER OF MERCURY  Enter hastily from the upper end of

God of Thieves bribe 'em to damn it"  "No Madam damn me if I do" I cry'd  She aim'd a blow I bow'd and hither hied  Now for my spell  Blows some powder out of his caduceus  There 'tisI see it spread  'Tis felt in ev'ry heartin ev'ry head  Now shall you fancy character and wit  Taste in the boxes humour in the pit  You'll fancy friends that 'tis so droll and funny  To the upper gallery  And you

can't prevail on her to prate less she won't last me another springThat woman will talk two hours without breathing to describe the effects of an emetic and if I did not lower her now and then by a gentle cathartic she'd evaporate through the lingual organs like air through a cracked bladder  SERV  I had like to have forgotMr Bellair is coming Sir  FEELOVE  Coming  No poor young fellow he's

FEELOVE  Aye ayethere are Josephs in the faculty I can promise ye Oh the white hands that I have seen put out between the sarcenet curtains with pulse disordered only by too much health Oh the bright

sixteen years has been her needle with the occasional reliefs of making seedcake and stewing codlings  EVERG  I know all thatI know all that  FEELOVE  Yes you know but you don't draw the inference Let me tell you that a girl who can't write who never heard of Point or Brussels whose only game at cards is  beggar my neighbour  and who thinks the Playhouse Ranelagh and Vauxhall the three great

Cornwall I was coming to London to be very happy but indeed I was happier there In the mornings I rambled in the woods and used to listen to the sweet birds till they made me weepin the evenings I walk'd by moonlightOh how I love moonlight walks with the distant village sounds dying on the ear till like the soft shades of the flowers they could hardly be distinguish'd  EVERG  Why you may have moonlight in London when it is not foggy and sounds of all sorts  ARAB  But my uncle never suffers me to stir  FEELOVE  No to be surenot till you are married  EVERG  No nor then neither without your husband  ARAB  Nor then neither why they tell me but I don't care about it that when I am married I must pay visits and receive company and ride in Hyde Park and be always in public without once thinking of my husband  EVERG  apart  Doctor five thousand must be added for that  FEELOVE  Why how now husseywho has been putting these wicked notions into your head  ARAB  Why sure they can't be wicked for the Rector's wife and daughters over the way do so and go out in fine carriages and have cards on Sundays  FEELOVE  Hussey hussey that's a Bishop's familya parish priest dared not be so wicked for his ears  EVERG  Come doctor don't be so harshmy little pet will be a good girl I have convinced her that she was made on purpose to be my wife and that it will be the duty of my wife to hate gadding and particularly to hate all young fellows  ARAB  Noyou said  particularly  those with cockades and gorgets  EVERG  Did Ithen I was too slack They are all the samethe gorgeted the scarf'd the broad bands and the narrow bands if they are young you must hate them alland if they presume to talk nonsense to you make me your secret keeper and then I shall be able to hold you up as the exact model of a perfect wife  FEELOVE  Yes and like other models it will be very badly copied But pray mistress in this pretty lesson of your's where do you find any thing about your visitings and gadding about in the libertine stile you were just now speaking of  EVERG  No nono modest woman receives visits from any but relations nor amongst those from none of a remoter degree than uncles and aunts  ARAB  What not a Cousin  EVERG  Not if it's a male cousinOh horrid a male cousin in the family of a young married woman is a worse monster than a mantiger  ARAB  But Mr Bellair is  not  my Cousinso I may let him come without any harmOh how I shall like to support his poor aching head on my bosom and when he is fainting to give him cordials and weep over him till he recovers  aside  FEELOVE  What are you saying Arabella  ARAB  I was only conning my lesson Sir that part of it is so pretty that whenever I think on it I sigh and feel so melancholyand yet 'tis a melancholy sweeter than all the pleasure I have ever tasted  Exit  EVERG  Aye go go that's my pretty Bell get it all into your head and never fear but it will influence your actions  FEELOVE  I must leave ye or my patients will be impatient  EVERG  Well I shall see you again in the evening meantime look over the parchments  Exit  FEELOVE  I will Why now I have been a fool I have made the bargain more favourable on his side than I needed I really believe he would have taken her with the ten thousand only I'll try to start some difficulty in the businessI hate to be overreach'd  Exit with the parchments  SCENE CARLTON's  CARLTON  and  BELLAIR  at Breakfast  CARL  More Ways than One indeed and  your  way is most singular imported with you I suppose from LeydenAssume  sickness  to captivate a blooming  girl  such  a way of lovemaking could never have occur'd but in a college  BEL  My sickness was assumed not to  captivate  but to get  introduced  to her You have often heard that pity is sister to love and I have  proved  it so in the heart of the gentle Arabella  Enter a Servant speaking to  BELLAIR  SERV  Your servant has been here Sir to say that Doctor Feelove requests you not to call till one as he is obliged to make a wide circuit this morning  BEL  Very well Bid him let my wrapping gown be ready with my pale complexion and all other necessaries  Exit servant  I must have a wider gown in  that  I am not sufficiently screen'd who but a Doctor could believe that these limbs belong to a fellow in the last stage of an atrophy  CARL  Oh they are so used to wonders you may make them believe any thing but have you never yet found a moment to convince  the Lady  that you have as much health and assurance as any man in town  BEL  Nevernor do I know that I yet wish it for I should then lose the luxury of her tender assistances the soft pressure of her hand and the tear dropping from her blue eye on my cheek whilst she believes me in a state of insensibilityHow can I bear to give up all that  CARL  Faith I don't know  BEL  Then to hear her sigh and ask her uncle in the teaderest accents  "if nothing can be done for me"  I swear a direct avowal of her passion would not give me such transport How charming to witness nature's  genuine feelings in a beautiful girl instead of those factitious ones impos'd by education  CARL  Her  mode of education has been strange sure do you find nothing repulsive in it  BEL  Repulsive quite the reverseit has a thousand charms for me Her mind is naturally so elegant and ingenuous that the task of polishing it can be but slight and that charming task will be mine I shall be her enamour'd Abelard  CARL  Is it so very charming to be a schoolmaster  BEL  What a phrase  impatiently  To unite the characters of lover and instructor seems to me the most interesting of human situations  "What joy to wind along the cool retreat  "To stop and gaze on Delia as I go  "To mingle sweet discourse with kisses sweet  "And teach my  lovely scholar  all I know"  So sung you know one of our first poets  CARL  One of our first poets is very welcome to have sung or said it But give me a woman whose soul is  all inform'd  and alive to every enjoyment of taste and feeling I would rather my wife should join in conversation with grace than shrink from it overpowered by her blushes and that she should make the men afraid of her wit rather than allure them by her simplicity  BEL  You speak as though you knew such a woman  CARL  Perhaps I maybut of that hereafter  BEL  Hereafter be it then for now I am impatient to be gone I must practise an hour before I  shall reduce my pipe to the shrill tone suited to my appearanceyou would not insure my life three days if you should see me when metamorphosed  CARL  Nor your understanding

hardly a man of your acquaintance who will not subscribe to my opinion of her  CARL  The strongest proof of her charms and of her power I adore her for being hated by all the men who have had the

our fair correspondent Clarissa to  learn to spell  before she pretends to write heroic verse" I wonder really at their impertinencethat a young lady of fashion can't amuse herself in rhyming a little about her friends but they must pretend to judge of the matter  Miss  ARCHER  enters  Oh my dear Miss Archer do you know that some cruel wretch here  Miss  ARCHER  Oh yes my dear I know it all you are

not worth mentioning Sir Marvel Miss Archer I hear you have been a traveller and that when in Italy they persuaded you to visit some of the Levant Islands I wonder when so far your taste did not carry you to Greece You can conceive nothing so charming as the Grecian womennothing so interesting as their style of livingyou would have found all Arcadia realiz'd  Miss  ARCHER  Greece and Arcadiaare these his apologieshis aukward embarrassments  Aside  CARL  I endeavoured to persuade a fair Greek that the fate of my countrywomen was happier than their's"Oh it is impossible" said she "their liberty makes them  capricious  and their power over the men  assuming  they grow old in planning new conquests and alive  only  to the pleasure of admiration seldom taste the exquisite bliss of true passion" I felt the force of her observation and could not help confessing that it  was possible  for a handsome English woman to border on the ridiculous  Miss  JUV  Aside  So that's tolerably home

occurredThe thing was doneMy friends liked itThey would have it appear I'll give you leave to abuse me with fifty times the wit  MARV  Fifty times as much wit gad I don't know where she'd find it  Miss  ARCHER  Then you do not think me Sir so veryI understand you do not think me so extremely odious and frightful  In great confusion  CARL  Oh that submissive look such another will bring me at her feet and then I am undone  Aside  Miss  JUV  Do you hear Mr Carlton is the lady so very odious and frightful  CARL  Frightful Oh no Madam The lady is very wellI wish I had abated a point or two in my epigram She is tolerably fair not a very bad shape and upon the whole aa most bewitching creature  Aside  Miss  ARCHER  Bless me Sir do you think I can stand here to be analyzed in this manner

shall make ye in one minute as mute as the bust of old Galen in your study This great impudent roaring debauch'd fellow who has carried off your niece without let or hindrance is the poor puling patient who was brought to your house every day for the benefit of the park air and whom you have pronounced to be beyond  the skill of all the physicians in Europe to keep out of a winding sheetNow Doctor you find there are more reputations than your niece's at stake  FEELOVE  A malicious invention of your ownsheer maliceThat poor young gentleman is in a state and I will prove it to make it

My patient Sirgood gentlemen speak how is my patient  BEL  Your patient Sir is as well as a patient can be who is out of the reach of his dd Doctor No further occasion for asses milk stimulatives balsamics or coolers  CARL  Alas poor Doctorno more feeshe has given you the  goby  fairly Is it not a shame that a man of your prowess in the fields of Galen should not be able to conquer such a pitiful hectic as drove him him out of the world why a physician ought to have the diseases at his call and whistle them on and off as a huntsman does his hounds  BEL  Aye 'twas a crying sin to let such a spirited fine young fellow be kick'd out of life by a rascally little feveret An old woman would have cured him but such an obstinate confidence in the skill of the renown'd Doctor Feelove He died full of resentment and his last words were"Toss the Doctor in a blanket"  FEELOVE  I can forgive thatI can forgive thatbut I can't forgive your illiberality Sir An old woman cure him It was not in the power of all the physicians between London and the Alps to cure himnot an herb gum wood or fungus in the whole medicopeia that could have given him breath two days longer  BEL  'Tis false SirBring the blanket  FEELOVE  I could not bear this treatment Sir but that the extreme satisfaction I have in Mr Bellair's death  BEL  Satisfaction  FEELOVE  Yes Sir My reputation my character demanded that he should dieI would not have had him alive tomorrow morning for a thousand pound fee  BEL  This is amazing  FEELOVE  Why Sir there is a vile story in circulation which if true would sink me beneath the lowest med'cine grinderbeneath a mixer of eggs and turpentinebeneath the cork in a julep bottle nothing less than that Bellair is in perfect health and so alive to youth and beauty as to have run away with my niecethey say  that  CARL  What is there this world will not say By all the honour of physic he has a dose in his pocket to have secured his reputation had he found thee alive  BEL  Apart  We'll search him and make him swallow it But have you then lost the young ladyis she gone  FEELOVE  Gone Sirabsolutely gone but as my poor patient is gone too I am in some measure reconciled to that event But bless me Sir you are vastly like hima man more liable to be imposed on might take ye both for the same personthe same voice and the same features only fresher and plumper  BEL  Oh ohWhat you have found me out Doctor Why I am his brotheryour poor patient's younger brotherand I should break my heart for his death only the dog has left me a clear estate of two  thousand a year to buy weepers In short Doctor I greatly fear'd your skill would preserve him and if it had  FEELOVE  Preserve him you might as well have expected my skill in physic to have preserv'd the French bank from breaking  BEL  Well notwithstanding my affected petulance at your entrance I am highly gratified that Bellair is where he isand I'll recommend you to all my friends and acquaintance But I wonder the loss of your niece sits so lightly my little Hippocrates  FEELOVE  Oh Sir I have a great hearta prodigious great heart its feelings are for the faculty A girl may run away from an uncle without reproach to him but when a patient runs away from the sentence of his physician the reputation of the doctor must soon run after him  CARL  Happily  our  patient knew his duty betterand so as we are now three very happy fellows let us e'en adjourn to the Star and Garter and live the evening like  bon vivants  FEELOVE  With all my heartand egad gentlemen I am so offended with the insolence of a certain person whom I will not name that if you'll discover my niece I'll give her to ye with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds The odd ten I'll stick to  Aside  BEL  Hah say ye so If I discover her shall she be my reward  FEELOVE  That she shall  BEL  May I rely on your promise  FEELOVE  With as much confidence as on the  symptoma of a fever I would give her to a rincer of gallipots rather than the person I had engaged her toto a pill venderto a mountebank  BEL  Bravo Doctor keep to that and we'll discover her enchanted castle never fear  CARL  That we will Allons let us

morning Oh may that rascal who cheated me yesterday to Hampstead never get rid of his wife till he is seventysix and then for his farther punishment may he grow rich and fall in love  SERV  May I be so bold Siris that a curse  FEELOVE  A curse why can there be greater than for a man to fall into riches when he has neither time nor faculties to enjoy them and to fall in love whilst he is falling into his grave If they are  blessings  may they be the lot of knaves and cowards and quacks Bring me the slate that I may see where I am to go  Enter  EVERGREEN  EVERG  Go why go to find your niece to

leap into the sea to disappoint thee  EVERG  Why we'd have you up again if you didwe'd empty your pockets I warrant you Riches are no more safe now in the bottom of the sea than a rainbow is in the clouds Neither earth sea or air in this happy age can keep their secrets from us and I have no doubt but some bold adventurer in the next will find out a way to live in fire or dart from continent to continent like Milton's angels on a condens'd sunbeam  FEELOVE  That  may be possible but for you to marry my niece with my consent is impossible  EVERG  What are you in earnest  FEELOVE  In
