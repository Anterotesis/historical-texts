 MADRIGAL AND TRULLETTA  A MOCKTRAGEDY  ACTED Under the Direction of Mr CIBBER AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  WITH NOTES by the AUTHOR and Dr HUMBUG Critick and CensorGeneral  By J REED  Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhyme  MILTON  LONDON Printed for W REEVE at  Shakespear's Head FleetStreet    Price One Shilling and Sixpence  PREFACE  AS I am under a necessity of giving a preface to the following work I shall in the language of our immortal countryman  imitate the  ROMANS  in brevity  as  brevity is the soul of wit  and not be so studious of the necessary ornaments of stile as of relating FACTS with the unbiass'd integrity of a faithful and impartial historian This I have thought fit to premise that the reader may not imagine he is running over a jumble of  facts and fiction  since it is but too common with modern authors of the poetical cast to lard their prefaces with a set of  ingenious  flourishes which carry a greater air of rhodomontade than truth  The following tragedy was originally written in  Italian  by the celebrated Signior FUNIDOSO DELL'ARUNDO formerly a rope∣maker in  Civita Vecchia  from which place he prudently retir'd to avoid the addresses of the lady INQUISITION who had a strange hankering after his person on account of his libertinism in reli∣gion for though a  Catholic  in appearance he was a  Lutheran  at heart In the year he arrived in  London  with that theatrical family of  Italians  who gave the town such exquisite pleasure in the performance of several incomparable  burlettas  all or most of which are said with what truth I will not venture to ascertain as I am writing a narrative of FACTS to be the production of our  hempen genius  In the following year which the reader without my chrono∣logical assistance will be able to discover to be the year Signior DELL'ARUNDO took shipping for  Newcastle  with an inten∣tion of residing in that part of the world on account of the cheap∣ness of the necessaries of life and accordingly settled in a sea port about thirty miles to the southward of that place He had not been many months in his new residence till he married a widow who was somewhat past the  heyday of her blood  or to speak less poetically pretty well stricken in years and before he had been a dozen moons in his alter'd state to his great affliction he lost his lady I might here according to the usual prolixity of histo∣rians take up my reader's time by telling him of what distemper the  Signiora  departed this life but as I don't intend to clog my narrative with  useless matters  I shall be totally silent on the occa∣sion nay I am so great a lover of conciseness in history that I shall not even so far intrude on my candid reader's leisure as to inform him that the lady died of a fit of the cholic  As our  Italian phoenomenon  was a great admirer of poetry it is no wonder after he had acquir'd a competent knowledge of the  British  language that he receiv'd so sensible a pleasure from the perusal of the  English  poets He was so captivated with the  masterly style and expression  of our dramatic authors especially  the more mo∣dern  ones  that he resolv'd to collect the principal beauties in our language and throw them into a tragedy form'd on the  British  plan in his native tongue which he at length so happily exe∣cuted that his performance will  undoubtedly  be an honour to lite∣rature in general and to the  Italian  language in particular  In  October  our celebrated foreigner departed this life and according to the phrase of our diurnal scribblers  universally lamented by all his acquaintance  and as a perpetual monument of the friendship which had long existed between  us  left his value∣able performance to my care in the following words contain'd in the body of his last will and testament  Item I give and devise to my most dear friend brother bard and brother ropemaker  JOSEPH REED  late of  STOCKTON  aforesaid now of  KING DAVID'S FORT  near  SunTavernFields London  all and singular my piece production performance drama or tragedy called  MADRIGAL  and  See Note in the First Act  TROLLETTA  with the prologue epilogue airs odes dirges and all appurtenances thereunto belonging or in any wise appertaining to be translated alter'd imitated and made fit for the  English  or other stage by him the said  JOSEPH REED  I also will and require that the profits arising from the publication or theatrical exhibition of the said tragedy be applied and issued to and for the sole use interest behalf advantage and emolument of him the said  JOSEPH REED  his heirs executors administrators and assigns only  willing and requiring  of him the said  JOSEPH REED  after such translation alteration or imitation is compleated that the original  at the sole ex∣pence of the said JOSEPH REED  may be sent to the  Vatican  library at  Rome  to be there preserv'd as a perpetual monument of my dra∣matic genius  I have given this extract to prove my legal title to the Piece for I must confess not withstanding that clause in the  bard's  MAGNA CHARTA call'd  poetica licentia  I think it little less than down∣right robbery to raise any considerable sum from the translation or alteration of the works of an  exotic  brother unless such brother or his descendents be admitted to go snacks in the profits I could wish that Mr POPE had been of my opinion in this particular but am sorry to tell the world he  was not  which I think no small blemish in his character It is universally known this great tho' little man pocketed  some thousands  by his translation of the works of MEONIDAS HOMER  Esq  one of the  fine old Grecians  yet I could never learn though I have made very strict enquiry that he had the gratitude or good manners to send even a bill of ex∣change or bank note of a cool hundred to any of Mr HOMER'S lineal descendents I am aware that some of Mr POPE'S advo∣cates will be ready to bellow out  Zounds the fellow's mad Where the devil could be find such descendents  But pray gentle∣men why did not your admir'd  little friend  advertise in all the pub∣lic papers in  Europe  and  Asia  to effect such discovery Instead of  this I could never find he advertis'd at all Had he but even issued out a notice to that purpose in our  Daily Advertiser only  I make no doubt but he would have had within eight and forty hours of the publication one or more claimants who would have proved their lineal descent  upon oath  which I think is as much satisfaction as any reasonable person who is not a downright in∣fidel would require But to return to my subject  If it be plagiarism without benefit of clergy to borrow a few lines from a native author it is certainly as criminal to steal whole plays from a foreigner When I reflect on the prevalency of this iniquitous practice I am ready to fall down on my  marrow∣bones  to return my humble and hearty thanks to goddess NATURE for so kindly disqualifying me for the perpetration of such offence by giving me the knowledge  of one language only  The filching of plays under cover of translation heaven knows is a crime of no short standing Nay some of our countrymen have carried their villainy to a yet greater height and stole plays with little or no alteration at all Among these abandon'd plagiaries I am told was AARON HILL  Esq  of turgid altering and translating memory  I have heard a report of his  borrowing  the tragedy of ZARA and as the story is in few hands I shall by way of se∣cret give it to my readers at the same time most earnestly con∣juring and requiring my said readers that it  may go no further  for I would not be known to propagate any rumour to the disad∣vantage of an author for whose memory I have so profound a veneration  In the year one thousand seven hundred and I have forgot what Mr THOMAS HUDSON then an usher to a grammarschool at  Durham  now a clergyman in  Northumberland  translated Mons VOLTAIRE'S  Zaire  On sending such translation to  London  for the perusal and examination of some connoissieur in drama it unfortunately fell into the hands of a considerable dealer in hats this  beaverite  having a more delicate taste in the  outside  than  in∣side  ornaments of a  head  gave the piece to a friend for such exa∣mination by means of which friend poor Miss  Zara  fell into the hands of the aforesaid poetical ravisher AARON who  Crop'd this fair rose and rifled all its sweetness  Then cast it like a loathsome weed away  Otway's Orph  that is in plain prose pilfer'd the copy and the better to con∣ceal the theft gave out that  the piece was absolutely unfit for the stage  but notwithstanding such insinuation in that or the follow∣ing season Miss  Zara  was thrown upon the town and receiv'd with universal applause It is true the play  in the strictest sense  could not be HUDSON'S as HILL had misplac'd  a single scene  and made the  considerable  alteration of  fifty lines or upwards  by which the property according to modern authors' latitudinarian notions of  meum  and  tuum undoubtedly  became his ownThe above anec∣dote I had from Mr HUDSON wherefore if brother AARON'S  ghost know it to be a fib I humbly desire the said ghost to take a trip into the  north  and confront the sermonizer I shall not pretend to ascertain the truth of this charge but only offer as my private opinion  on the side of the church  that the stiles of the  English Zara  and  Merope  both the same author's in  French  are almost as different as those of  Jane Shore  and  Irene  After this digression I shall lay before the public my embar∣rassments concerning this tragedy Signior DELL'ARUNDO had un∣fortunately forgot that his  most dear friend  understood no human language but that of his mother tongue however that no pains might be wanting on my side to do as much honour as I could to the production of my deceased brother I got one of the  OperaTranslators  to give me the piece in  English  but alas the version was  so very sublime  that I could not possibly understand any three lines of it together After this I employ'd my friend PETER RONE professor of languages to give me a literal translation which answer'd my purpose so well that I was able to trace many of the beauties our foreigner had borrow'd from the  English  play∣wrights Where the context would allow I have given the many  striking  passages in the very dress of the respective authors from whom they were undoubtedly borrow'd where the text would not allow me such passages in the very words I have by parody or imitation kept as near the  sublime originals  as I possibly could  Signior DELL'ARUNDO in a codicil to his will hath also left me subject to the aforesaid conditions the farther legacy of three plays viz one Comedy and two Tragedies called the  Contrast  the  Distress'd Princess  and the  Distress'd Wife  The Comedy is thought to be a tolerable piece but as to the Tragedies I must own I think them greatly inferior to the following work They have no  triumphal entries  ROMAN  ovations sacrifices dirges processions ghosts drums trumpets thunder lightning battles miraculous revo∣lutions  so necessary according to Mr BAYES'S rule to ELEVATE and SURPRIZE or any of that  sublime rant  which may be call'd the very soul of modern tragedy In short they have nothing but na∣ture propriety and simplicity of fable and diction to recommend them I have been advis'd to lard them plentifully with the above  tragic artillery  but so deprav'd is my taste that I cannot listen to such innovation I rather chuse to wait till  nature  and  common sense  come into play again on the  British  stage In the mean time if the town have a desire to see the theatrical exhibition of the said pieces and the said town can or will raise me a patron that hath influence sufficient to procure their representation  one  or  more  of the said pieces shall be at the service of the public in the ensuing season  That nothing might be wanting to render the following pro∣duction as entertaining as possible I have prevailed on my learn∣ed and ingenious friend Dr HUMBUG to assist me in writing annotations to the piece  I can hardly conclude this preface without an intimation of the excellency of Mr DAVIS in the character of BUCKRAMO I hope his  voice figure  and  abilities for the stage  will in the ensuing season intitle him to the regard of the Public on a PATENT THEATRE  PROLOGUE  YE awful censors of the tragic scene  Who come from principle of  fun  or  spleen  To rob the bard of fame and profit too  Rob him of that which not enriches you  Othello  And make him  poor  indeed for this  one  night  Forgo the pleasantry of  damning spite  Prologue to Cato  Our author shuns in scenes of sound and show  To move by  buckram  springs of  royal  woe  Where  struts  and  starts  and  twists  and  lungs  supply  The want of nature sense and energy  He casts his drama in life's  humbler  sphere  That the  small vulgar  with the  great  may share  The mournful pen'orths of his tragic ware  No hackney'd tale or plan our bard would chuse  For the sad subject of his  melting  muse  Hoping from  novelty  to draw renown  For  novelty's  the darling of the town  His many  moving  incidents are ta'en  From whence  The book and volume of his brain  Hamlet  Our bard he hopes without offence presumes  To deck his  mimic play  with borrow'd plumes  Whene'er the nature of his subject brought  A  known  similitude of tragic thought  He snatch'd the sentiment  already  penn'd  Afraid to  alter  what he could

WestSmithfield  In the original it is  Madrigal  and  Trolleta  As sound may be reckon'd among the primary beauties of the  Italian  drama I am almost persuaded our author fix'd on TROLLETTA to render the name of his heroine more musical and harmonious A  British  author should prefer sense to sound wherefore I have by the alteration of a single letter made it  Trulletta  the force the significancy and the propriety of which name will be obvious to the most illiterate  English  reader I wish for the honour of my country the preference of sound to sense were confin'd to ITALY only We have melancholy instances in some of our modern tragedies that such infection hath reach'd even the  British  climate  MADRIGAL AND TRULLETTA A MOCKTRAGEDY  ACT I  SCENE I  A Garret  BUCKRAMO STRAPADA  embracing  BUCKRAMO  In the first six lines of this tragedy our author seems to have had his eye on the beginning of the d act of  Cato  viz  Thanks to my stars I have not rang'd about  The wilds of life e'er I could find a friend  Nature first pointed out my  Portius  to me  And early taught me by her secret force  To love thy person e'er I knew thy merit  Till what was instinct grew up into friendship  Which lines tho' extremely beautiful are far short of the subli∣mity of our author  Instead of  thanking his stars  which is the hackney'd phrase of every mechanic and  nature pointing out  he puts into BUBKRAMO'S mouth  Thanks to allbounteous fate whose index hand  Hath pointed out  c  which undoubtedly is more pompous and sublime Not to men∣tion any thing of  white moments informing instinct plucking a soul by the sleeve  and other beauties in this passage it will be suffi∣ciently apparent to a reader of even ordinary sagacity how much our author has improved on Mr ADDISON  Dr HUMBUG  THANKS to allbounteous fate whose index hand  Hath pointed out STRAPADA for my friend  The moments sure were white and lucky all  A better order of succeeding days  Comes smiling forward while and lucky all  Fair Penitent  When by the sleeve informing instinct pluck'd  BUCKRAMO'S soul and cried "BUCKRAMO list  "BUCKRAMO take STRAPADA to thy heart  Happy BUCKRAMO Thrice more happy far  The beauty elegance and the propriety of this and the following simile are scarce to be equalled in any language  Dr HUMBUG  Than whisker'd Turk who on Elysian plains  Satiates his fancy with immortal nymphs  Or halfstarv'd 'prentice whose supplying purse  Can gratify when tiresome shop is shut  A punning critick of my acquaintance to whom I lately shew'd this tragedy made the following remark  Tripe is partly deriv'd from guts wherefore your Italian friend hath given the world a proof he had some guts in his brains when he hit upon this simile  With tripe or sausages his craving maw  A figure of such universal use among tragic writers that if I were to give all the examples which have occur'd to me in the perusal of  English  tragedy they would make as large a folio as any of the ancient fathers  Dr HUMBUG  But oh STRAPADA oh my friend amid  This flow of joy BUCKRAMO'S soul is pierc'd  As with a paring knife or bodkin sharp  Strap  O ye immortal powers that guard the just  O ye immortal powers that guard the just  Watch round his couch and soften his repose  Cato  And govern all contingences below  With careful watch beset BUCKRAMO'S soul  And keep for ever keep it free from woe  What is it that torments STRAPADA'S friend  Two games well known to gamblersThe reader may ob∣serve in this definition that I have imitated the manner of the ingenious N BAILEY Philologos A specimen of this judi∣cious author's abilities may be seen in his explication of the word thunder which he defines  "A noise known by persons not deaf"  Hath Put or Cribbige with insatiate sweep  Of all thy coin despoil'd thee left thee bare  And pennyless or  salamander  nymph  Inhabitant of DRURY from thy fob  With faithless palm decoy'd thy gutless watch  Or infidel retailer of INTIRE  I cannot in this place forbear taking notice of the negli∣gence of our dictionarymongers in omitting the word INTIRE or as it is frequently written ENTIRE in the sense I have now used it I am persuaded they cannot plead the obsoleteness of the word since there are so many  signal  instances of the use and propriety of it in and about this metropolis For want of such previous explanation I am not ashamed to own that I was led into a very great error in regard to the true meaning of the word when I first came to  London  On seeing  Parsons Intire  at the bottom of a sign I took it for a laconic advertisement That intire or finish'd clergymen might be hired or heard of at that place This mistake of mine I have thought proper to mention that the future publishers of dictionaries may not slip over the explanation of a word of such consequence  Denied a morning draught of purl on tick  Say why is this speak speak I charge thee speak  Speak speak I charge thee speak  Hamlet  If our author had not visibly borrow'd this expression I should scarce have imagin'd the preceding part of the speech was in∣tended as an imitation of  Horatio  's beautiful address to the ghost  Buck  Yes I will speak will to STRAPADA tell  The latent secrets of my inmost soul  Know then but by the sacred ties of friendship  A solemn conjuration to secrecy and of equal importance to the secret about to be revealed there are so many resem∣blances of this speech in our dramatic writers that I hardly know from which of them our  Italian  hath borrow'd  By all the spangled train of glitt'ring stars  By my grim father's shade who pendent died  That no future critick may plume himself with the dis∣covery of a blunder I have thought proper to inform my rea∣ders it was not the father's shade but the father himself  who pendent died  On gallow tree  On gallow tree I charge thee keep it lock'd  From mortal cognisance from human ear  An alien yes STRAPADA wouldst thou think it  I am yes by the Gods I am in love  Strap  Ye heavenly powers in love astonishment  On my corporeal faculties hath made  Sudden arrest unsay it and I'm happy  Thy head with melancholly shake confirms  The doleful truth ah what a falling off  Oh  Hamlet  what a falling off was there  Hamlet  Is here in love O lost undone BUCKRAMO  But say what witching nymph with magic glance  Hath stung BUCKRAMO'S soul  Buck  What if it were  TRULLETTA wouldst thou disapprove the choice  Strap  A very imperial but  foolish  oath reply'd the punning cri∣tick  By JOVE'S imperial bird not I not I  The simplicity beauty and propriety of this thought can∣not be sufficiently admired Some criticks may possibly disbe∣lieve the story of the  wand'ring Jew  but that does not at all affect our author in the choice of this image since fiction as well as fact is allowable in poetry Our Bard liv'd in a coun∣try where tradition had greater weight than in this infidel island But that our author may not be suppos'd to have taken this image from tradition only I can assure the world I have seen several editions of the history of this remarkable traveller and could produce a hundred gentlemen of veracity to attest the like and as none of our criticks have yet shewn the falsity of such history it is to me a sufficient proof that there was is and must be such a person as the  wand'ring Jew  A certain modern author hath intimated the image is too low for the dignity of tragedy and advised the following alternation viz  For sure the sun in his diurnal round  Nor moon nor stars e'er saw a form so fair  but I would ask the judicious reader whether according to our present knowledge of the heavenly bodies it would not be downright nonsense to talk of the sun moon or stars  seeing a form so fair  Several dramatic authors make no scruple of af∣firming these bodies are capable of vision and among the rest the ingenious Mr ROWE who says  if only  The midnight moon and silent stars had seen it  Fair Penitent  but unless Mr ROWE means the man in the moon or the sup∣posed inhabitants of the starry orbs  seeing it  he must mean no∣thing at all  Dr HUMBUG  For should the  Wandring Jew  with restless search  Rumage this ball of earth from east to west  From south to north thro' all its different climes  He could not find a fairer lovelier she  Our author seems to have drawn this beautiful image from the  FrenchEnglish  song of  Sweet a prittee  Bettee  den de moon brighter  Or scow'r pewder or silver spoon  No splendent pewter from the scourer's hand  Comes half so bright shea's beauty might en∣snare  shea's beauty might ensnare  A conqueror' soul and made him leave his crown  At random to be scuffled for by slaves  Caius Marius  A miser's soul and make him leave his bags  At random to be scuffled for by th' Mob  So radiant is her form so more than mortal  That if perfection were with her compar'd  This may be stiled in Mr BAYES'S phrase the poetical  non ultra  Dr HUMBUG  'Twould seem imperfect  Buck  Hold thy lavish tongue  Or jealousy will mad my raging soul  Strap  Far as futurity's untravel'd waste  This and the following line from  Irene  a tragedy of the sublimest diction in the  English  language  Dr HUMBUG  Lies open to conjecture's dubious ken  It seems to me thou wilt not canst not win  The peerless virgin but by blood and broil  For MADRIGAL a Grubstreet sonetteer  Her senses fascinates with magic rhyme  The bard incessant tunes the sapphic lyre  And paints her in his song of mien divine  Wellpleas'd she hearkens to the praiseful strain  As venal statesmen to the chink of gold  And deems herself the goddess he pourtrays  Buck  Too well alas alas too well I know  Her fond affection for the starvling bard  Bard did I say a balladmonger rather  A wilful murderer of sense in rhyme  Now by the powers his ditties scarce outvie  The pasted ornaments of cobler's stalls  Do we not know that GARRICK hath refus'd  DAVID GARRICK  Esq  an actor and manager of the theatre in  Drury Lane  in the th century This great man though not above five feet six inches in stature was the most cele∣brated and universal performer that ever trod the  British  or any other stage in the known world In all his theatrical per∣sonations he was so exact a copyer of nature that it was a proverb in his day with the best judges of the stage  Nature and  GARRICK  are the same  This note my readers are desired to remember is made for the benefit of the lovers of drama in the year two thousand and upwards It would be an affront to the above gentleman's merit and universality to add a note to inform the world who and what he is or even to suppose that his memory would not outlive his theatrical performances at least a brace of centuries  The horrid fustian he so vainly stiles  A tragedy at which the caitiff swears  That GARRICK is a dolt a goose a fool  Strap  True my brave friend would she like GARRICK too  Refuse his suit  Buck  She must she shall STRAPADA  By hell in spite of all her wayward pride  I'll have her still spite of her self I'll have her  This may at first sight appear a kind of  Tipperarian  rho∣domontade but according to the method of bringing about many modern marriages I believe my readers will soon be convinc'd that several young ladies have been drawn into the nuptial state in spite of their own inclinations which is all our author means  Dr HUMBUG  Tho' fate and all the world should join t'oppose me  Or by the gods I'll lay a scene of blood  Shall make this dwelling horrible to nature  I'll do't bark you my lord  Orphan  Or by the gods I'll lay a scene of blood  Shall make her dwelling horrible to nature  I'll do't hark you my friend this very night  I'll put her to the trial should the maid  With uncomplying stubbornness refuse  On horror's head horrors accumulate  Othello  On horror's head horrors accumulate  Shall wait her mansion see this trusty bodkin  And guess the rest  Strap  What means my noble friend  O blood Iago blood  Ibid  Buck  Blood blood STRAPADA blood by th' powers of hell  By the powers of hell  I will be drunk with vengeance  Regicide  A liquor I never yet heard of  Dr HUMBUG  I will be drunk with vengeance princely drunk  With blood's rich nectar I will murder all  That suckin vital air beneath her roof  Nay not a louse shall 'scape to tell the tydings  Strap  How not a louse escape a single louse  On what extremes extreme distress impells me  Brothers  An extreme pretty line  Dr HUMBUG  To what extremes extreme revenge impells thee  What turn a murderer ten thousand fold  To glut thy vengeance on the marbled maid  Thy inclination to shed blood rides post  Fatal Secret  If Mr THEOBALD at the time of writing this celebrated line were not riding post on  Pegusus  we may fairly conclude there is no such beast as a poetical posthorse  Dr HUMBUG  Thy inclination to shed blood rides post  Art thou so lost to virtue to revenge  Thy slighted vows on a poor peaceful tribe  A harmless people that have wittingly  Ne'er done thee wrong Now by my awl I swear  Such cruelty ensanguin'd speaks a mind  Of temp'rament infernal fare thee well  I'll never hold communion with thee more  But from the daybook of my dearest friendship  I'll cross thee out I love thee yet BUCKRAMO    Cassio  I love thee  But never more be officer of mine  Othello  But never more be intimate of mine  Buck  What means STRAPADA

unfledg'd brood  To which his partner had an equal claim  Thus thus I ring thee off  joining his little finger to  BUCKRAMO'S  Buck  O stay my friend  A very common tragical expression nay I have known many dramatick heroes uttering such complaints when they have been absolutely  mad  from their first speech in the play An instance of this  dramatic madness  may be found in a tra∣gedy which was publish'd by subscription in the present cen∣tury  Dr HUMBUG  Or thou wilt run me into madness nay  By all the shades of my great ancestry  By all thy virtuous friendship to SCOURELLA  The dame who give me birth my more than mother  Oh my  Sciolto  oh my  more  than father  Fair Penitent Which phrase may probably mean  grand  father or  great grand  father  HUMBUG  Thou shalt not leave me

world with day  Amb Step  but the thought of our heroine's eyes eclipsing the sun is cer∣tainly a more striking and sublime allusion than ever was yet met with on the subject of eyes  Dr HUMBUG  Now

 Scul  Our author in this scene hath given us a second proof of his knowledge of human nature in preferring simplicity of expression to a chain of pompous words In most of our mo∣dern tragedies the chamber maid or to speak more politely the  confident  is drawn a person of better sense than the mi∣stress which is indeed sometimes the case and her diction is generally more elevated but our author shews his dislike of such practice by making a chamber maid speak like a chamber maid  Dr HUMBUG  That will be pure but come TRUL∣LETTA waits  SCENE III  A Parlour  MADRIGAL TRULLETTA  meeting  Mad

hungry kisses  Alexander the Great  The expression of eating with hungry kisses is undoubtedly very sublime but the same author in his  Massacre of Paris  carries the image yet  higher  where he says  And eat your  Marguirite  with your hungry eyes  The epithet  hungry  is frequently used by tragic authors which may probably be occasion'd by the hunger they so often expe∣perience The sublime Mr  Banks  in his  Earl of Essex  hath the elegant phrase of  hungry nostrils  with hungry nostrils  waits for my blood  which last word I am apt to imagine an error of the press I am of opinion it ought to be read  snuff  as  snuff  is almost the only food for the nostrils  Dr HUMBUG  And eat thee with my hungry kisses Now  Ye envying deities  Olympian  Aquatic  and  Infernal  see behold  An author

especially when brew'd by the threepenny retailers  Dr HUMBUG  Of punch that compound manifold he sips  May my dear father's grinning spectre rise  And snatch th' uplifted nipperkin away  From his untasting lips when from his glass  Our author seems to have had an eye on the following passage in the dedication to  Merope  viz  Life's evening gleam survey  Nor shake th' outhast'ning sands nor bid them stay  It may not be amiss to inform my less knowing readers that the said dedication is in rhyme and that it is indubitably the most sublime and poetical dedication in the  English  language There are such a variety of beautiful sentiments figures and meta∣phors in it that it will bear reading over a thousand times For my part I must ingenuously own the style is so very masterly and poetical that I am not yet acquainted with all its beauties tho' I have studied it like an enigma  Dr HUMBUG  Of life th'outhast'ning sands are shook may fiends  Hurry the wretch into a hell more hot

I  The Street  STRAPADA  A Yearning fondness hangs about me still  A woman's softness bangs about me still  Fair Penitent  I'd give the empire of ten thousand worlds  Our author could not have given a finer demonstration of the virtuous and philosophical character of STRAPADA than in this and the following line I could wish that all mankind would imitate our virtuous cobler in the conscientious observance of his vow He hath so strict a regard to what he has sworn that he would even give the empires of ten thousand worlds for the bare privilege of unswearing a rash oath The height of that  yearn∣ing fondness  to BUCKRAMO as our author most pathetically ex∣presses it could not be more strongly drawn than in these two happy lines  Dr HUMBUG  For privilege to unswear what I have sworn  His father was my friend and taught me first  This and the two succeeding lines are a distant imitation of somewhat in the character of  Horatio  in the  Fair Penitent  With curved awl to pierce the

SCOURELLA  It is too much to bear spite of my vow  This conflict in the bosom of  Strapada  plainly shews that our author design'd to draw him a man as well as a philoso∣pher two characters which seldom meet in the same person especially in dramatic philosophers The struggle is so great that the tenderness of the man overcomes the stiffness of the sage and compells him to break that vow which a few minutes ago he would have  given the empire of so many thousand worlds  to forswear with impunity In the midst of the conflict we still find him so great a friend to virtue that he only pardons his repenting friend on condition of his being  virtuous  That this frailty in regard to his vow may not appear a blemish in the character of our heroic cobler I must beg leave to inform my readers that such breach of rash vows in dramatic heroes hath seldom or never been counted criminal I could produce many instances of such frailty that of  Pierre  in  Venice Preserv'd  may suffice without quoting further authorities  Dr HUMBUG  I must I must relent there is a way  To reinstate thee in my love be virtuous  The friends of virtue are STRAPADA'S friends  Forgo thy black design on MADRIGAL

 which paints it as the effect of idleness and prodigality but I am not yet so much a slave to vulgar prejudice as to sup∣pose that idleness and prodigality are the sources of  Gaming  Yet should we judge of its merits from its prevalency in the fashionable world we might rather esteem it to be the effect of a laudable desire of acquiring riches and a praiseworthy calling under which character the worst of men insinuate themselves into the company of gentlemen and nobles And I am of opinion that the philosopher's stone notwithstanding all the labours of the chymical tribe will be found if ever it be found by a  gaming  projector  Dr HUMBUG  Strap  Then all my flattering hopes of thy reclaim  Are lost and my shock'd soul akes at thee  And my shock'd soul akes at him  Merope  See note of

hideous nest of crimes  Guilt's first sad stage in her dark road to hell  Whose thickbarr'd sunless passages for air  Do keep alive the wretch that longs to die  Was thy majestic eyebeam clos'd in blood  Merope  A very majestic description of murder but rather too much on the sublime for common capacities In compassion to the be∣nighted understandings of my countrymen in general I could with the publisher of the sublime tragedy of  Merope  would in his next edition of that wonderful production annex a glossary that the beauties of that piece might be more universally understood and comprehended by those who have not had the good fortune of an academical education  Dr HUMBUG  Was thy majestic eyebeam clos'd in gin  In the th century the inhabitants of  Great Britain  were very much addicted to drinking a liquid call'd  Geneva  or ac∣cording to its usual abbreviation  gin  which was a slow but sure poison They swallow'd it as the  Turks  do opium meerly for the sake of intoxication The consumption of this liquid was so great that some thousands of  poisoners general  distin∣guish'd by the  modest  appellation of  distillers  got their liveli∣hood nay some of them amass'd immense fortunes by the com∣position of this inebriating spirit So great was the skill of these chymical poisoners that they could extract this intoxicating liquor from molosses juniperberries turpentine nay I be∣lieve had they set about it from the upper leathers of old shoes but the chief and most benefical principles from which they could possibly draw this fatal juice were wheat barley or other grain In the years and on account of the real or artificial scarcity of grain in  England  these gentry were pro∣hibited the use of it which so affected the distillery that hap∣pily for the nation several of its professors were obliged to leave off their pernicious trades and launch into less destructive cal∣lings During such prohibition it was remark'd that human excrement both  a priori  and  a posteriori  bore an advanced price which might probably arise from the use of these fragrant mate∣rials in distillery This conjecture is not at all unnatural as  bread  and  porter  after they have undergone the internal opera∣tions must still retain some remaining part of their  wheaten  and  malten  qualities For my part I am almost confirm'd in this opinion from the near analogy of flavour between  gin  and that more  solid  species of excrement on which the  honours of knight∣hood  hath been time immemorial conferr'd After so long a note it will be almost unnecessary to prove the truth and pro∣priety of our author's stiling  gin  the  bliss and bane of human life  especially as drunkenness seems to be the primary happiness of the present age  This note I have written partly for the present and partly for the future tense  Dr HUMBUG  In gin that bliss and bane of human life  O could my pious drops recall thy breath  My sluicing eyes should pour such cataracts  This seems to have been drawn from the following beauti∣ful lines  Pouring forth tears at such a lavish rate  That were the world on fire they might have drown'd  The wrath of beaven and quench'd the mighty ruin  Mithridates  Of ceaseless tears as would redeluge earth  And pickle the huge mass in human brine  The  napping  of the gods is very frequently intimated by tragic authors  Dr HUMBUG  O all ye sleeping gods why did you thus  Nod o'er your charge supine and suffer one  So sagely form'd to close his deathshrunk reign  Sagelyform'd  and  deathshrunk reign  two dramatic flou∣rishes of the author of  Merope  By copious swill of gin lethiferous  Ye should have dash'd the untasted moisture from him  Did he not dash th' untasted moisture from him  Cato  But hence this prophanation 'tis impiety  To question the just gods since reason's line  And reason's line wants depth to sound heaven's will  Merope  Here are two technical terms viz  line  and  sound  which it be∣hoves me to explain The  line  in the text is a  lead  or  deep sea line  a species of cordage about three quarters of an inch in cir∣cumference to which is fix'd a quantity of lead to make it gra∣vitate or sink to the bottom more expeditiously when thrown into the sea to find the depth of water which is called  sounding  This by the by is a kind of proof that Mr HILL imagin'd the will of heaven to lie  below  and not as commonly suppos'd  above  If Mr HILL in this remarkable image had written  length  instead of  depth  it would have been much more clear and intelligible but as obscure phrases are generally more poetical than common ones Mr HILL was undoubtedly in the right to give the word as it now stands in the text  Wants depth to sound th' Olympian will  SCENE V  TRULLETTA GHOST  Some of our modern connoissieurs in drama mistakenly suppose a  ghost  is a kind of unnecessary agent in tragedy To those learned gentlemen who are of such infidel opinion I beg leave to recommend the authority of no less ingenious and ju∣dicious a writer than Mr JOHN GAY of facetious memory who in his  What d'ye call it  puts into the mouth of the saga∣cious Sir  Roger  this conclusive argument on the necessity of ghosts in dramatic exhibitions viz  A play without a ghost is like is like egad it is like nothing  Dr HUMBUG  Trul  Dread powers  What would your awful

boatswain calls  A whistle within  He pipes me hence my wasted respite grants  No longer stay again relentless dog  I come but this short prayer not for my self  Not for my self but thee hear me allgracious  SCENE VI  TRULLETTA  'Tis wanting what should follow Jove should follow  An imitation of  Osmyn  's complaint in the  Mourning Bride  But 'tis torn off why should that word alone  Be torn from his petition  Quere  whether a word with as much propriety may be said to be torn off from a  verbal  as from a  written  petition This I recommend as a question to be debated by a  certain disputing society  Dr HUMBUG  why indeed  SCENE VII  This and the two foregoing scenes in imitation of many of our modern tragedies appear to be introduced on Mr  Bayes  's principle viz  "What a devil is the plot good for but to bring in fine things"  MADRIGAL TRULLETTA  Mad  Hail to you horrors hail thou house of death  Hail to you horrors hail thou house of death  And thou the lovely mistress of these shades  Fair Penitent  And thou the mournful mistress of these shades  But ha what means this quivering in thy limbs  This terror in thy eyes these ghastly looks  This image is taken

here it must portend  Some festinating evil but to whom  Or what my comprehension fathoms not  It hath been often observ'd that mechanics generally speak in the terms of their respective callings The word  fathoms  is a proof that our author is not free from this almostuniversal ab∣surdity  Dr HUMBUG  This is however sure so sage a ghost  Would hardly come on an unmeaning errand  But more of this

hint's officious note had reach'd his ear  Those who are acquainted with the sublimity of Mr HILL'S style need not be inform'd from whom this line is borrow'd  Dr HUMBUG  That you was here In his right hand he bore  Most terrible to tell a glitt'ring bodkin  And ask'd if I had seen you I replied  Forgive me  Jove  the pious falshood no  On which with sullen aspect he rejoin'd  "Well I may meet him e'er the noon of night"  That is I presume when the moon is in her meridian and not as commonly suppos'd at midnightMany tragic au∣thors are fond of this beautiful phrase  Dr HUMBUG  Lean wolves forget to bowl at night's pale noon  Theodosius  But see where silent as the noon of night  These lovers lie  Regicide  Mad  Where is the stall my gentle SCUL∣LIONA  This line and the remaining part of the speech from  Hamlet  Our hero seems to be in greater earnest than the young  Dane  as he flies with greater expedition to his revenge  Haste me to know't that I with wings as swift  As meditation or the thoughts of love  May fly to my revenge  Trul  A breathless horror  I am persuaded our author would scarce have ventur'd on this expression if he had not found it in so correct a writer as the author of  Eugenia  for fear of incurring the charge of an  Iricism  How  breathless horror  can  heave panting at the heart  is not very obvious to human understandings but Mr  Francis  must have undoubtedly been satisfied of the possibility of such an effect of he would hardly have made use of the expression  Dr HUMBUG  Heaves panting at my heart Indeed my Love  You must not hence

thee Now even now  A flow of fondness gushes from my eyes  And did not honour's call command me hence  I would not leave thee for the laurell'd wreath  That binds a MILTON'S or a SHAKESPEAR'S brow  The sirnames of two bards that will be an honour to  Great Britain  as long as her present language is known The first the greatest  epic  poet that ever existed the last so great a dramatic genius that to him to imitate his own phrase  All the  NINE  did seem to set their seals  To give the world assurance of a bard  To this note Dr HUMBUG hath added  I am sorry to inform the world these two immortal men were such latitudinarians in morals that the former was a  rebel  and the latter a  deerstealer  But throwing thus my arms about thy neck  If throwing thus my arms about thy neck  I play the boy and blubber in thy bosom  Oh I shall drown thee with my sorrows  Venice Preserv'd  Would play the boy and blubber in thy bosom  Till I had drown'd thee with my streaming tears  Trul  And is it possible that thou should'st love  Yet leave me thus inhumanly  Mad  Forbear  Cast to the ground this unprevailing woe  Hamlet  This unprevailing woe Alas 'tis more  Than death to see thee weep  An

Love why dost thou hang upon me  Release me give me way let go my arm  Trul  Thou shalt not leave me  Mad  Shalt not have a care  Thou'lt wake the slumb'ring lyon in my breast  Our author hath borrow'd this image but I cannot satisfy she reader's curiosity from whence  Dr HUMBUG  Do not provoke my rage too far thou know'st  My hasty temper quit thy stubborn hold  Or by the gods I'll force thee to forego it  Trul  Behold my streaming eyes  Mad  Ha shall the tears  This hemistic and the four following lines which for their sublimity may be rank'd with any in the  English  language are taken verbatim from  Boadicia  Of abject importunity detain me  While vengeance striding from his grizly den  With fell impatience grinds his iron teeth  And waits my nod to satisfy his hunger  Not all the tears that ever yet were shed  Could stop my rapid course May JOVE exhaust  May heaven exhaust  Its thunders on my head may hell disgorge  Infernal plagues to blast me if I cease  To persecute

With thee a kneeling world  As I cannot recollect from what author I have borrow'd this sentiment I should take it as a favour if the said author or his ghost would give me a letter post paid to inform me in which of his performances it may be found in which case I assure him that honourable mention shall be made of it in the next publication of this tragedy if my bookseller have the good fortune to get off the present edition and courage to venture on a second  Should sue in vain Unhand me gentlewomen  Unhand me gentlemen  By heaven I'll make a ghost of him that lets me  Hamlet  By hell I'll make a ghost of her that lets me  Nay 'tis in vain to strive no force can hold me  Let BROUGHTON or let SLACK do what he may  This and the following line a parody from the tragedy last mention'd As these two heroes are so universally known it would be loss of time to say any thing about them  Dr HUM  The cat will mew and dog will have his day  breaks from them  SCENE III  TRULLETTA SCULLIONA  Trul  Then go inhuman bard begone for ever  I vainly hop'd TRULLETTA'S eyes had power  To check th' impetuous sallies of his rage  So have I heard with equal suddenness  This simile which for its beauty propriety elegance and I may justly add conciseness for it only consists of  twelve lines  may be called the masterpiece of simile Allowing the alterations of  scate  for  dolphin  and  lobster  for  whale  it is almost verbatim as in the sublime original which may be found in the close of the third act of  AbraMule  a tragedy written by a  Levitical playwright  My punning friend on reading this simile replied "  So I see you understand  TRAP"  Ebbing prodigiously the sea withdraw  And quite defenceless left the scaly race  The huge scate which e'er while with wanton pride  Spread his broad fins and lash'd the foaming tide  Vainly essay'd to suck the faithless flood  With heaving gills and tumbled in the mud  The lobsters whose great trunks the stars could reach  Flounc'd their huge claws and panted on the beach  So have my hopes whose waves e'er while ran o'er  And to the skies my towering wishes bore  Retir'd and left me gasping on the shore  SCENE IV  The

ho BUCKRAMO  SCENE V  MADRIGAL BUCKRAMO  Buck  Ha who calls BUCKRAMO  With lungs so loud and vehemence so great  Is it the voice of thunder or of man  Buckramo  seems to be in the same perplexity with  Calista  where she says  Is it the voice of thunder or my father  Fair Penitent  That such mistake in sounds may not appear unnatural to the tragic already quoted I shall add a comic authority which comes from the mouth of no less ingenious a personage than Mr  Scrub  in the  Stratagem  Archer "Did you hear nothing of Mrs  Sullen"  Scrub "I did hear something that sounded that way but whe∣ther it was  Sullen  or  Dorinda  I could not distinguish"  Mad  Of one that comes to scourge thy insolence  Presuming arrogant unletter'd slave  The altercation in this scene between our two heroes seems to be a distant imitation of that  spirited  conference between  Horatio  and  Lothario  in the  Fair Penitent  Thou little more than a bare tythe of manhood  Buck  The lewdest sland'rer that e'er broach'd abuse  One would naturally imagine from this verse that Mr  Theobald  whom envy itself notwithstanding  Pope  's sarcasm viz SHAKESPEAR  of  TIBBALD  sore  must allow to be a judicious editor had been a tapster as well as a critick and playwright The curious reader may find the above image in the  Fatal Secret  Dr HUMBUG  Came short of this Take note take note gods  Take note take note O

criticks a set of snarling people that right or wrong must always be finding fault have establish'd it for a standing rule that dramatic heroes must never be allow'd to degenerate into  Billingsgate  scolds If authorities were necessary to refute this absurd restriction I could bring a whole string of exam∣ples from our best playwrights ancient and modern to prove the legality of sarcastic raillery and altercation in tragedy The immortal SHAKESPEAR makes his  Danish  heroe call his  fatherunclesovereign  A cutpurse of the empire  A king of shreds and patches  A vice of kings  and a great many other names ROWE makes  Lothario  call his opponent a  tavernbully slave villain beggar parasite  c These authorities to mention no others will certainly justify the use of a few sarcastic appellations  Dr HUMBUG  Buck  Dost thou compare the fashioners of man  With these base botchers of the verseful train  What are ye but a shrivel'd halfstarv'd race  Of living skeletons shadows of

the stars is much more rational than that of  Lothario  who says  Tomorrow oh my better stars tomorrow  Exert your influence shine strongly for me  Fair Penitent  The combat propos'd by the  Genoese  duelists was to be at ten in the morning wherefore a petition for the stars to  shine strongly for him  in the  forenoon  must certainly border a little on the absurd Our author was within an ace of falling into Mr ROWE'S mistake but perceiving the blunder he sensibly checks himself and adds  My gracious stars I mean tomorrow night  Dr HUMBUG  My gracious stars I mean tomorrow night  Exert your

judiciously usher'd in a dreadful night by way of prologue or preparative to the cata∣strophe of their plays Such preparative seldom fails of suc∣cess as it throws a gloomy melancholy o'er the mind and ren∣ders the reader or audience more susceptible of the ensuing distress of the performance It further serves to heighten the character of the hero or heroine for certainly nothing can be a stronger proof of the dignity and importance of any perso∣nage than when we are convinced that even nature itself is mourning the impending fall of her favourites  Scour  Tho' age hath snow'd  Till age  Hath snow'd a hundred winters on thy head  Constantine  The word  snow'd  in the sense now implied is a favourite meta∣phor with a variety of authors yet I am of opinion the thought would be

Penitent  The stars sleep in their sockets scarce a ray  Of light t'illume the welkin's pitchy cope  But what the sheeted light'ning's flash affords  The bursting thunder roars with frightful crack

old woman of  sixty  whose sight we may naturally imagine to be none of the best is able to discern with the naked eye such minute objects as bodkins and inkhorns in the air  To such critick I shall reply  and pray what is there unnatural in all this Might not the light'ning enable our matron to make such discovery Tho' her eyes were none of the best yet she might dis∣cern these objects through ber spectacles nay possibly thro' a tele∣scope But pray Sir who inform'd you of the size of bodkins and inkhorns which you arbitrarily call such minute objects Not our author I'm confident For any thing you know to the contrary they might be as large as a maypole nay as the Monument itself In short Sir if you know any thing of the figure  HYPERBOLE  which every author hath a right to use you would have been silent on this occasion Besides with all your sagacity you cannot even tell whether  SCOURELLA  really saw them or no from the relation she gives she may be as naturally suppos'd to

peace some comfort to thy mournful bard  Trul  May the shrill catcall's knell the boxes sneer  This dying speech and prayer of our heroine is an ori∣ginal and perhaps one of the finest pieces of

Buck  Got by a templar while my father liv'd  Our author more sensibly to heighten the distress of the piece hath judiciously brought about a discovery that cannot fail of having its proper effect Discoveries of this kind and introduced for the same purpose are frequently met with in dra∣matic writings  Dr HUMBUG  In cruel exile on  Columbian  shores  This cruel exile probably means transportation This conjecture seems to be strengthen'd by what we are told of BUCKRAMO'S father in the first act viz that he  pendent died  On gallow tree  Ibid  Then I am sentenc'd to eternal woe  Eternal yes eternal and eternal  Eternal yes eternal and eternal  Brothers  Our author might have mended this line both as to sense and sound if he had not stuck so close to the DOCTOR as thus

And for this purpose I'll anoint my sword  I bought an unction of a mountebank  So mortal  that no cataplasm so rare  can save the thing from death  That is but scratch'd withal  Hamlet  This long quotation I have thought proper to give that the reader might not too hastily imagine the manner of our heroe's death in the least unnatural  Dr HUMBUG  With unguent bought of mountebank so pois'∣nous  That if the  Aesculapian  deity  Instead of my poor brother had been scratch'd  A poison of such deadly force  Should  Aesculapius  drink it in five hours  For then it works the god himself were

with catcall in thy hand  In this and the following speeches of our hero the author hath shewn uncommon abilities for painting a mad scene I must ingenuously own I think it the most natural madness I ever met with  Dr HUMBUG  Whose looks malign and yellow eyes bespeak  A jaundic'd mind by hell thou art the monster  Yclep'd a critick seize him devils seize him  Whip him with scorpion's stings and rods of iron  Roast him in elemental fire and baste  His hissing frame with boiling sulphur mix'd  With his own gall  Scou  O my poor raging child  Buck  O monster monster  beats his breast  Mad  Zembla  's isles of ice  Are in me how I shiver cold cold cold    The ghosts of our heroine and her father seem to rise on the same important business with those of  Jassiere  and  Pierre  in  Venice Preserved  Dr HUMBUG  Ghosts of  Cabbagino  and  Trulletta  rise    Angels and ministers of grace defend me  Angels and ministers of grace defend us  Hamlet  They wave me stay ye dear illusions stay

Now cracks the cordage of a noble heart  Hamlet  Our author shews more of the tradesman than the bard in the mention of an hempen manufacture though I think as a trades∣man it is not much to his credit to speak of a cracking commo∣dity  Dr HUMBUG  Goos  Then drag your chief to justice  Buck  Soft my friends  Soft you  I've done the state some service and they know it  in  Aleppo  once  Where a malignant and a turband  Turk  Beat a  Venetian  and traduc'd the state  I took by th' throat the circumcised dog  And smote him thus  O bloody period  Othello  I've done the craft some service and

alarms  Gives up hot  youth  a prey to  youthful  arms  Produces fraud and cruelty and strife  This tragedy originally ended with the line  Forbids the holy rites of funeral  on which the punning critick beforemention'd observ'd it was an  immoral  play Our author took the hint but could not be prevailed on to annex a moral I expostulated with him in the most friendly manner on the necessity of such termination of the play but he very  obstinately  and  whimsically  insisted that a moral unless drawn up in the epilogue was unnatural be∣cause it is an immediate address to the audience which audi∣dience the  speaker  in his dramatic character cannot with pro∣priety suppose to be present that it could not properly be spoken by any of the persons in the drama unless such per∣son had been present during the whole representation and was consequently acquainted with every incident in the play that it was an affront to an audience to suppose them inca∣pable of drawing a moral from the representation that it was a modern custom and in his opinion  More honour'd in the breach than the observance  Hamlet  that many judicious authors had shewn their dislike of such prac∣tise particularly GAY who severely satiriz'd it in his ingenious and pithy epilogue to the  What d'ye call it  viz  Our stageplay has a moral and no doubt  You all have wit enough to find it out  and finally that our immortal SHAKESPEAR seldom or never concluded any of his plays with a moral  He was so obstinate on the occasion that it was with no small difficuity I could prevail on him to suffer me to annex the foregoing moral which the reader may perceive is taken with slight alteration from the most finish'd tragedy that any language hath yet produced I mean Mr ADDISON'S  Cato  As I have now ended my annotations and occasionally scat∣ter'd a few  encomia  on the play it will be naturally expected I should give my summary opinion of its merits which I shall deliver not so much with the candour of the friend as the impartiality of the critick I shall divide the subject of my remarks into three heads viz the fable the manners and the diction  As to the fable but it had quite slipt my memory that the printer's boy hath been waiting this half hour at my elbow for the finishing note wherefore I must defer my criticism till the next edition of this tragedy  Dr HUMBUG  And robs the
