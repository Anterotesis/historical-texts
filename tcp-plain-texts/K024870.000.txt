 A LETTER FROM THE COCOA TREE TO THE COUNTRY GENTLEMEN  LONDON  Printed for J NICHOLLS in St  Paul's Church Yard  Price Threepence  A LETTER c  GENTLEMEN  ENGAGED to you by every sentiment of affection and esteem united with you in the same political principles and ideas of the constitution I need not prosess my zeal for your interests and honour I have always acted with you and can now look back with pleasure on our past conduct I find it steady and uniform except in one instance when we were first insensibly engaged and afterwards as insensibly carried too far in support of the War in Germany I make this acknowledgment without apprehension of offending as I know your opinions upon that subject But a new and extraordinary crisis of affairs is coming forward which will call upon us to maintain the integrity of our political principles and character  I am therefore desirous to lay before you such Reasons as in my opinion ought to influence our future conduct and engagements with regard to the strange things that are passing here  An opposition is forming against the measures of government Such is the language of some people to express a personal dislike to ministers or a contest for power for places and employments Could I think it perfectly decent I would rather call the present opposition a formed design against his MAJESTY'S independance and liberty in exercising the most constitutional prerogatives of his crown The declared and avowed intention of the great persons engaged in it is to command the present reign and dictate to their Sovereign  humbly  to inform him to whom he shall give not only the direction of the public affairs but even his private affection and esteem  Two noble persons and a third still more noble have declared themselves the patrons and leaders of this opposition The two first appear in support of the whig interest and the old English  families formerly distinguished by that denomination They complain that the tories by which title they mean to distinguish the countrygentlemen to whom I am writing are received by the present administration into offices of trust and confidence or what perhaps in spight of the spirit of resigning they more resent into places of profit in the state Thus have they revived those unhappy distinctions under which our fathers were enlisted and engaged in almost civil war The noble persons would renew this war and in contradiction to all constitutional principles would narrow the bounds of majesty and confine its cares its attention and its bounty to a part which ought to be diffused through the whole of the nation Thus would they make their sovereign in Hamlet's language a king of shreds and patches instead of the common father and monarch of his people  Another of their complaints is truly most unaccountable that his MAJESTY in proof of his first declaration to his parliament is indeed a Briton true to the interests of his native country and  uninfluenced by any predilection for Hanover An attachment to German measures was the deepest stain of the two late reigns When his present MAJESTY came to the Throne he found us involved in a continental war to which the dearest interests of this nation had been sacrificed The dignity and honour of the kingdom were ignominiously abandoned by treaty to the insolence and arrogance of the King of Prussia May no such treaty ever appear again to stain and darken the glory of the British annals in this situation our sovereign gracious and good would have given up Hanover to the welfare of his native country He would have put an end to the German war Impossible He would have recalled his British troops Impracticable This continental mischief hung like a dead weight immoveable upon all other operations of the war It lay equally heavy upon the negotiations of peace and emboldened our enemies to refuse us those terms which we had a right from our successes in every part of the world to demand But if the noble persons have founded  their opposition upon these complaints against their sovereign what wonders of political architecture may we not expect when they raise the superstructure of saction upon such a foundation  But in truth what do they propose That one of them should indulge his natural disposition and please himself with the hopes of finding his account in tumults and confusion in parliamentary disputes and the riots of elections is nothing wonderful They may recall a momentary youth and bring back to his imagination those illustrious scenes in which he first displayed his political abilities Experience then taught him the value of these active virtues and habitude has confirmed him in his good opinion of their merit Even age and its unavoidable infirmities have not convinced him of the breach of character in engaging again in the contests of ambition with people who are only entering on this busy tumultuous scene I do not mean to blame and I shall not presume to pity him  Whoever has not in himself and his own understanding the resources of retirement and selfenjoyment is allowed to go abroad at whatever indecent hour for amusement and dissipation His age however might justly startle the most sanguine spirits that found their future hopes of ambition upon a life of more than threescore and ten But some gentlemen furely influenced rather by a principle of gratitude than any reasonable appearance of his success in this desperate project have resigned their employments useful at least if not absolutely necessary to their oeconomy What have they to expect from a life of seventy years animated by the short and wasting vigour of the rage of faction and an unnatural ambition  The second noble Person is of so different a character so naturally an enemy to violent and precipitate councils that it is amazing by what influences he could be wrought to engage in the present system of opposition He certainly does not foresee the unhappy consequences into which he will unavoidably and without a possibility  of retreating be led by these engagements He who loves his country and reveres the constitution is exposing them both to certain confusion and at least probable distress There is another circumstance with regard to this noble Person not a little singular With all affliction and reverence for his Majesty he is entering into league and amity with a party who are determined to distress his measures and insult his administration  It is wholly foreign to the design of this letter to enquire into the circumstances either of his resignation or Dismission I hope however he does not think it the right of subjects only to resent and that princes are to be insensible to the neglect of duty and the indecent behaviour of their servants But if the noble Person founds his opposition upon the indignity whether real or supposed with which he has been treated where shall we fix our ideas of virtue particularly that first of virtues the love of our country when a man shall dare to avow his private resentment as a justifiable reason for his opposing publick measures Upon this plea the late Lord  Bolingbroke  has justified his entering into the service of the Pretender and his leaving it "But an ancient family is dishonoured by such an indignity" What right has any man to plead the merit and services of his ancestors who has himself deviated from that line of conduct which they thought duty to their sovereign  But as I conceive we are deeply interested in the conduct of this noble person we are therefore authorised to enquire into the motives of it and I think we may rely upon the following account He had early in life conceived some very exalted notions of the rights of whiggism to direct the administration and to govern the sovereign He therefore would no longer hold an employment by which he was bliged to the mortification of seeing the Taries  sight hateful fight tormenting  received at court upon equal terms of grace and favour with other subjects in proportion to their personal merit their birth and fortune He was sometimes obliged by his office to introduce them to the royal presence  The third noble person feels it a matter of his indignation that his sovereign will not again enter into his nonage and submit himself to a second pupillage He would gain by force that power with which neither the wisdom of his royal Father nor the apprehensions of the people would intrust him in the year But of what injuries does he complain He has been treated during the present reign and more especially during the present administration with every distinction due to his rank and relation to the crown Even in the latest instance when a plan was formed by the ministry for the reduction of the Havanna it was immediately sent to him for his approbation The commander in chief was appointed according to his nomination Every thing he asked in order to secure the success of the expedition was instantly complied with The vigour of the ministry seemed to second his demands Never were any troops better appointed Upon what pretence of complaint therefore can he enter into an unnatural alliance in  opposition to the interests of his own Family What views of future power can tempt him to join with a man whom he most sincerely detests to distress the Crown to which he is so nearly related Is it  Agrippina  's impotence of ambition  eo loedi quia non regnaret  Does he consider himself a prince of the blood and is this his proper conduct Does he acknowledge himself a subject and is this his proof of duty to his sovereign But in truth he is as much a subject to the Crown and in all human probability as far removed from the throne as any private gentleman in England Oliver Cromwell indeed rose to the tyranny of his country as a private gentleman and Richard the Third as an uncle  We have often been reproached with our apprehensions of military power Whether those apprehensions were in themselves just or not we certainly were justified in being watchful to repel even a possible danger so formidable indeed so fatal to the liberty of our country It is wisdom to foresee such danger it is courage to meet it in its approach it  is our duty to die or to repel it But now what will they who used to impute our fears to us as crimes what will they say now when the profession of the opposition is to govern the King absolutely when the leader of that opposition is a military leader who has hardly any other ideas of government than what he learned in the German discipline which our soldiers unused to such severity such cruelty so sensibly felt and so loudly resented If this man comes into power by violence he must maintain it by violence Yet when he places himself at the head of Faction every officer who has a seat in parliament and joins under such a leader in such a cause must give us very serious apprehensions We cannot look upon such a member of parliament as a man merely following his own opinion in civil matters Whenever he succeeds he becomes an instrument to oppress the liberty of a Free People But when this commander in chief both of the King and army shall pour abroad his spirit upon the soldierythe unhappy Roman  upon whom Sylla either forgot or neglected to smile was butchered by his guards  Shall we then unite with him in designs of such dreadful apprehensions to the very being of the constitution we have in reproach been called the dupes of many oppositions Adhering to our common principles we have despised such reproach Yet in honour to our understanding let us not be the dupes to those who invite us to join in our own destruction and the destruction of what ever is most dear to us But how does this noble person propose to himself a possibility of engaging us to support his opposition by what methods does he propose to carry this extraordinary project into execution By methods as extraordinary as the project itself A certain Right Honourable Gentleman is supposed to have a mighty influence over us an influence powerful enough to turn us from our interest our duty and even our gratitude  We have the highest opinion of the Right Honourable Gentleman's abilities  His influence amongst us is acknowledged But what arguments can possibly convince us that we ought to engage in this most unnatural alliance what eloquence seduce us from our present Honourable situation we are here placed between the person of our sovereign and the dangerous rage of party between the prerogatives of his Crown appointed by the wisdom of the constitution and the intrigues of precipitate ambition joined with the arrogance of Family and led on by a spirit that delighteth in blood If the Prerogatives granted to the throne by our ancestors are either oppressive or dangerous to liberty let them be legally taken away But let it be well considered before they are given to another part of the constitution some of whom have already shewn their inclination to render themselves formidable to the liberty of their country In proof of his assertion three or four families have formed an opposition that dares to threaten and insult their sovereign They have assumed to themselves  as most honourable the no longer existing title of whigs they have given to us country gentlemen as most ignominious the no longer existing name of tories  I have not mentioned the folly with regard to our interest of uniting with these noble persons I should think it almost an indignity to mention the word interest to gentlemen who I am persuaded will act upon other motives those of principle and honour of probity and a love for our country Such have hitherto been the motives of our conduct and surely nothing can hereafter be given us in exchange for our integrity no recompence for the violation of that character which we have always and I trust we shall always maintain  I am Gentlemen Your most obedient Servant
