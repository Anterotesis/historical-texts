 ZENOBIA  ZENOBIA A TRAGEDY  As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURYLANE  By the AUTHOR of the ORPHAN OF CHINA  LONDON Printed for W GRIFFIN in Catharinestreet Strand  MDCCLXVIII  P s d  TO Mrs DANCER  MADAM  IN a country where addresses of this nature have generally waited upon the Great upon a Wealthy Merchant a Rich Commissary or some New Man from the Sugarislands it will appear as surprizing to many as no doubt it will to yourself that a New Form of Dedication should now be introduced For the trouble I am giving you it will however be unnecessary to make any further apology when I observe that in France where talents are honoured it has been frequently the practice of the most cele∣brated wits to do justice to those who by their pro∣fession are the very Organ of the Muses A VOL∣TAIRE and a MARMONTEL have paid their compli∣ments to a CLAIRON and why may not an English Author inferior as he is and ever must be to writers of that class rival at least their politeness by addressing himself to Mrs DANCER one of the first Ornaments of the British Theatre  There are indeed I must confess it some demands upon my gratitude on this occasion which even now are struggling to call my attention another way Mr GARRICK Madam has a claim to all the hand∣some things that can be said of him His politeness from the moment he saw the play his assiduity in preparing it for representation the taste with which he has decorated it and the warmth of his zeal for the honour of the piece are circumstances that call upon me for the strongest acknowledgements I  could employ my pen with pleasure in thanking Mr BARRY for the very fine exertion of his powers wherever the Poet gave the smallest opportunity Mr HOLLAND who had before now given spirit to such scenes as mine has renewed the obligation I could add others to the list but they and even Mr GARRICK at their head must excuse me if I turn to Mrs DANCER and say with  Hamlet  "Here's mettle more attractive"  ZENOBIA Madam is your own entirely Where∣ever my inaccuracy has left imperfections they are so happily varnished over by your skill that either they are not seen or you extort forgiveness for them and if the Author is any where happy enough to  snatch a grace  beyond his usual reach it is multi∣plied by your address into a number of beauties like the SWORD in  Tasso'  s  Jerusalem  which when bran∣dished by the hand of  Rinaldo  appears to the whole army to be THREE SWORDS  The fate of ZENOBIA has been very extraordinary She was saved in her lifetime from the waters of the  Araxes  by the hand of a shepherd and now she is saved from the critics by Mrs DANCER  In testimony of the fact the play Madam is now inscribed to you by him who admires your talents and remains  Your most obedient Servant THE AUTHOR  March    PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr HOLLAND  OF oldwhen Greece in a declining age  Of lawless pow'r had felt the barb'rous rage  This was the tyrant's artHe gave a prize  To him who a new pleasure should devise  Ye tyrants of the Pit whose cold disdain  Rejects and nauseates the repeated strain  Who call for rarities to quicken sense  Say do you always the reward dispense  Ye

Christian systemstabs you in the dark  And yet the desp'rate author of tonight  Dares on the muses wing another flight  Once more a dupe to fame forsakes his ease  And feels th' ambitionhere again to please  He brings a tale from a far distant age  Enobled by the grave historic page  Tacitus Ann Lib Sect to end of    Zenobia's woes have touch'd each polish'd state  The brightest eyes of France have mourn'd her fate  Harmonious Italy her tribute paid  And sung a dirge to her lamented shade  Yet think not that we mean to mock the eye  With pilfer'd colours of a foreign dye  NOT to translate our bard his pen doth dip  He takes a play as Britons take a ship  They heave her downwith many a sturdy stroke  Repair her well and build with Heart of Oak  To ev'ry breeze set Britain's streamers free  NEWMAN her and away again to sea  This is our author's aimand if his art  Waken to sentiment the feeling heart  If in hit scenes alternate passions burn  And friendship love guilt virtue take

ZELMIRA  THRO' the wide camp 'tis awful solitude  On ev'ry tent which at the morning's dawn  Rung with the din of arms deep silence sits  Adding new terrors to the dreadful scene  My heart dies in meharkwith hideous roar  The turbulent Araxes foams along  And rolls his torrent thro' yon depth of woods  'Tis terrible to hearwho's thereZopiron  Enter  ZOPIRON  ZELMIRA  My lord my Husbandhelp me lend your aid  ZOPIRON  Why didst thou leave thy tentwhy thus afflict  Thy anxious breast thou partner of my heart  Why wilt thou thus distract thy tender nature  With groundless fearser'e yonder sun shall visit  The western sky all will be hush'd to peace  ZELMIRA  The interval is horrid big with woe  With consternation peril and dismay  And oh if here while yet the fate of nations  Suspended hangs upon the doubtful sword  If here the trembling heart thus shrink with horror  Here in these tents in this unpeopled camp  Oh think Zopiron in yon field of death  Where number soon in purple heaps shall bleed  What feelings there must throb in ev'ry breast  How long ambition wilt thou stalk the earth  And thus lay wastemankind  ZOPIRON  This day at length  The warlike king victorious Pharasmanes  Closes the scene of warThe Roman bands  But ill can cope with the embattled numbers  Asia pours forth a firm undaunted host  A nation under armsand every bosom  To deeds of glory fir'dIberia then  ZELMIRA  Perish Iberiamay the sons of Rome  Pour rapid vengeance on her falling ranks  That he who tramples on the rights of nature  May see his vassals overwhelm'd in ruin  May from yon field be led in sullen chains  To grace the triumph of imperial Rome  And from th' assembled senate humbly learn  The dictates of humanity and justice  ZOPIRON  Thy generous zeal thy ev'ry sentiment  Charms my delighted soulBut thou be cautious  And check the rising ardor that inflames thee  The tyrant spares nor sex nor innocence  ZELMIRA  Indignant of controul he spurns each law  Each holy sanction that restrains the nations  And forms 'twixt man and man the bond of peace  ZOPIRON  This is the tryger's den with human gore  For ever floats the pavement with the shrieks  Of matrons weeping o'er their slaughter'd sons  The cries of virgins to the brutal arms  Of violation dragg'd with ceaseless groans  Of varied misery for ever rings  The dreary region of his curs'd domain  ZELMIRA  To multiply his crimes a beauteous captive  Th' afflicted Arianashefor her  For that fair excellence my bosom bleeds  She in the prime of ev'ry blooming grace  When next the glowing hour of riot comes  Shall fall a victim to his base desires  ZOPIRON  The bounteous gods may succour virtue still  In this day's battle which perhaps e're now  The charging hosts have join'd should Roman valour  Prevail o'er Asia's numbers  ZELMIRA  That event  Is all our hopeAnd lo on yonder rampart  Trembling with wild anxiety she stands  Invokes each god and bids her straining eye  Explore the distant field  ZOPIRON  Yes there she's fix'd  A statue of dispairThat tender bosom  Heaves with no common griefI've mark'd her oft  And if I read aright some mighty cause  Of hoarded anguish some peculiar woe  Preys on her mind unseenBut ha behold  She faintsher fears too pow'rful for her frame  Sink that frail beauty drooping to the earth  Exit hastily  ZELMIRA  Haste fly Zopiron fly with instant succour  Support her help herLo th' attendant train  Have caught her in their armsassist her Heav'n  Assuage the sorrows of that gentle spirit  Her flutt'ring sense returnsand now this way  The virgins lead herMay the avenging god  In pity of the woes such virtue feels  In pity of the wrongs a world endures  With pow'r resistless arm the Roman legions  That they may hurl in one collected blow  Assur'd destruction on the tyrant's head  Enter  ZENOBIA  leaning on two attendants  ZENOBIA  A little onward still a little onward  Support my steps  ZELMIRA  How fares it madam now  ZENOBIA  My strength returnsI thank ye gen'rous maids  And would I could requite youfruitless thanks  Are all a wretch can give  First attendant  The gentle office  Of mild benevolence our nature prompts  Your merit too commandson Ariana  We tend with willing with delighted care  And that delight o'er pays us for our trouble  ZENOBIA  Your cares for me denote a heart that feels  For other's woesMethinks with strength renew'd  I could adventure forth again  Second attendant  'T were best  Repose your wearied spiritswe will seek  Yon rising ground and bring the swiftest tidings  Of all the mingled tumult  ZENOBIA  Go my virgins  Watch well each movement of the marshall'd field  Each turn of fortunelet me know it all  Each varying circumstance  ZENOBIA ZELMIRA  ZELMIRA  And will you thus  Be doom'd for ever Ariana thus  A willing prey to visionary ills  The selfconsuming votarist of care  ZENOBIA  Alas I'm doom'd to weepthe wrath of heav'n  With inexhausted vengeance follows still  And each day comes with aggravated woes  ZELMIRA  Yet when Iberia's king when Pharasmanes  With all a lover's fondness  ZENOBIA  Name him not  Name not a monster horrible with blood  The widows orphans and the virgin's tears  ZELMIRA  Yet savage as he is at sight of thee  Each fiercer passion soften into love  To you he bends the monarch of the east  Dejected droops beneath your cold disdain  And all the tyranny of female pride  ZENOBIA  That pride is virtuevirtue that abhors  The tyrant reeking from a brother's murder  Oh Mithridates ever honour'd shade  Peaceful he reign'd dispensing good around him  In the mild eve of honourable days  Thro' all her peopled realm Armenia felt  His equal swaythe sunset of his pow'r  With fainter beams but undiminish'd glory  Still shone serene while ev'ry conscious subject  With tears of praise beheld his calm decline  And bless'd the parting rayyet then Zelmira  Oh fact accurs'dyes Pharasmanes then  Detested perfidynor ties of blood  Nor sacred laws nor the just gods restrain him  In the dead midnight hour the fell assassin  Rush'd on the slumber of the virtuous man  His life blood gush'dthe venerable king  Wak'd saw a brother arm'd against his life  Forgave him and expir'd  ZELMIRA  Yet wherefore open  Afresh the wounds which time long since hath clos'd  This day confirms his sceptre in his hand  ZENOBIA  Confirms his

curs'd ambition  Deaf to a nation's voice a nation's charter  Nor satisfied to fill Iberia's throne  Made war unnatural war against a son  Usurp'd his crown and with remorseless rage  Pursued his life  ZELMIRA  Can Arians plead  For such a sonmeans she to varnish o'er  The guilt of Rhadamistus  ZENOBIA  Guilt Zelmira  ZELMIRA  Guilt that shoots horror thro' my aching heart  Poor lost Zenobia  ZENOBIA  And do her misfortunes  Awaken tender pity in your breast  ZELMIRA  Illfated princess in her vernal bloom  By a false husband murder'dfrom the stem  A Rosebud torn and in some desert cave  Thrown by to moulder into silent dust  ZENOBIA  You knew not RhadamistusPharasmanes  Knew not the early virtues of his son  As yet an infant in his tend' rest years  His father sent him to Armenia's court  That Mithridates' care might form his mind  To arts to wisdom and to manners worthy  Armenia's sceptre and Zenobia's love  The world delighted saw each dawning virtue  Each nameless grace to full perfection rising  Oh he was all the fondest maid could wish  All truth all honour tenderness and love  Yet from his empire thrown with merciless fury  His father followingslaughter raging round  What could the hero in that dire extreme  ZELMIRA  Those strong impassion'd lookssome fatal secret  Works in her heart and melts her into tears  Aside  ZENOBIA  Driv'n to the margin of Araxe's flood  No means of flightaghast he look'd around  Wild throbb'd his bosom with conflicting passions  And must I thentears gush'd and choak'd his voice  And must I leave thee then Zenobiamust  Thy beauteous

he then could grant  To perish with him in a fond embrace  The foe drew neartime press'dno way was left  He clasp'd me to his hearttogether both  Lock'd in the folds of love we plung'd at once  And sought a requiem in the roaring flood  ZELMIRA  This wondrous talethis sudden burst of passion  ZENOBIA  Hawhither has my phrenzy led mehark  That sound of triumphlost for ever lost  Ruin'd Armeniaoh devoted race  A flourish of trumpets  Enter  TIGRANES Soldiers  and some  Prisoners  ZENOBIA  Thy looks Tigranes indicate thy purpose  The armies met and Pharasmanes conquer'd  Is it not so  TIGRANES  As yet with pentup fury  The soldier pants to let destruction loose  With eager speed we urg'd our rapid march  To where the Romans tented in the vale  With cold delay protract the ling'ring war  At our approach their scanty numbers form  Their feeble lines the future prey of vengeance  ZENOBIA  And wherefore when thy sword demands its share  Of havoc in that scene of blood and horror  Wherefore return'st thou to this lonely camp  TIGRANES  With cautious eye as I explor'd the Forest  Which rises thick near yonder ridge of mountains  And stretches o'er th' interminable plain  I saw these captives in the gloomy wood  Seeking with silent march the Roman camp  Impal'd alive 'tis Pharasmanes' will  They suffer death in misery of torment  ZENOBIA  Unhappy menand must theyhathat face  That

Where mild affectionwhere each virtue dwells  Just to behold thee and then close my eyes  In endless night while you survey my pangs  In the approaching agony of torment  ZENOBIA  Talk not of

When Ariana pardons my resentment  Yields to her smile and looks away it's rage  As when the crimes of men Jove's wrath demand  And the red thunder quivers in his hand  The queen of love his vengeance can disarm  With the soft eloquence of ev'ry charm  Controul his passions with resistless sway  And the impending storm smile to serenest day  Exit with his train  ZENOBIA TERIBAZUS  TERIBAZUS  And may I then once more thou bright perfection  May Teribazus once again approach thee  While thus my fathermy ambitious father  At sight of thee forgets his cruel nature  And wonders how he feels thy

bleeding herethy gen'rous worth  Is oft the livelong day my fav'rite theme  But oh for mefor wretched Ariana  The god of love long since hath quench'd his torch  And ev'ry source of joy lies dead within me  TERIBAZUS  That cold averted lookbut I am us'd  To bear your scornyour scorn that wounds the deeper  Mask'd as it is with pity and esteem  Yet love incurablerelentless love  Burns here a constant flame that rises still  And will to madness kindle should I see  That hoard of sweets that treasury of charms  Yield to another to a barb'rous rival  Who persecutes a son to his undoing  ZENOBIA  If Ariana's happiness would wound thee  Thou'lt ne'er have cause to murmur or repine  Naught can divorce me from the black despair  To which I've long been wedded  TERIBAZUS  Calm disdain  I grant you well becomes the tyrant fair  Whom Pharasmanes destines for his throne  But oh in pity to this breaking heart  Give me in mercy give some other rival  Whom I may stabwithout remorse may stab  Midst his delight in all his heav'n of bliss  And spurn him from the joys that scorpionlike  Shoot anguish herehere thro' my very soul  ZENOBIA  Alas too gen'rous prince the gods long since  Between us both fix'd their eternal bar  TEREBAZUS  What say'st thou Arianaha beware  Nor urge me to destractionLove like mine  Fierce gener'ous wildwith disappointment wild  May rouze my desp'rate rage to do

rage can murder  None in the pow'r of fateoh Teribazus  The wretched Arianalong long since  My heart swells o'erI cannot speaka duty  A rigorous duty bids me ne'er accept  Thy proferr'd lovea duty
