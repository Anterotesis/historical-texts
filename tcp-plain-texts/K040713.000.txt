 THE  London  Merchant OR THE HISTORY OF  GEORGE BARNWELL  As it is Acted at the THEATREROYAL IN  DRURYLANE  By HIS MAJESTY's Servants  By Mr  LILLO    Learn to be wise from others Harm  And you shall do full well  Old Ballad of the Lady's Fall  LONDON Printed for J GRAY at the  CrossKeys  in the  Poultry  and sold by J ROBERTS in  WarwickLane  MDCCXXXI Price OneShilling and Sixpence  TO Sir  John Eyles  Bar Member of Parliament for and Alderman of the City of  London  and SubGovernor of the  SouthSea  Company  SIR  IF Tragick Poetry be as Mr  Dryden  has some where said the most excellent and most useful Kind of Writing the more extensively useful the Moral of any Tragedy is the more excellent that Piece must be of its Kind  I hope I shall not be thought to insinuate that this to which I have presumed to prefix your Name is such that depends on its Fitness to answer the End of Tragedy the exciting of the Passions in order to the correcting such of them as are criminal either in their Nature or through their Excess Whether the following Scenes do this in any tolerable Degree is with the Deference that becomes one who wou'd not be thought vain submitted to your candid and impartial Judgment  What I wou'd infer is this I think evident Truth that Tragedy is so far from losing its Dignity by being accommodated to the Circumstances of the Generality of Mankind that it is more truly august in Proportion to the Extent of its Influence and the Numbers that are properly affected by it As it is more truly great to be the Instrument of Good to many who stand in need of our Assistance than to a very small Part of that Number  If Princes  c  were alone liable to Misfortunes arising from Vice or Weakness in themselves or others there wou'd be good Reason for confining the Characters in Tragedy to those of superior Rank but since the contrary is evident nothing can be more reasonable than to proportion the Remedy to the Disease  I am far from denying that Tragedies founded on any instructive and extraordinary Events in History or a wellinvented Fable where the Persons introduced are of the highest Rank are without their Use even to the Bulk of the Audience The strong Contrast between a  Tamerlane  and a  Bajazet  may have its Weight with an unsteady People and contribute to the fixing of them in the Interest of a Prince of the Character of the former when thro' their own Levity or the Arts of designing Men they are render'd factious and uneasy tho' they have the highest Reason to be satisfied The Sentiments and Example of a  Cato  may inspire his Spectators with a just Sense of the Value  of Liberty when they see that honest Patriot prefer Death to an Obligation from a Tyrant who wou'd sacrifice the Constitution of his Country and the Liberties of Mankind to his Ambition or Revenge I have attempted indeed to enlarge the Province of the graver Kind of Poetry and should be glad to see it carried on by some abler Hand Plays founded on moral Tales in private Life may be of admirable Use by carrying Conviction to the Mind with such irresistable Force as to engage all the Faculties and Powers of the Soul in the Cause of Virtue by stifling Vice in its first Principles They who imagine this to be too much to be attributed to Tragedy must be Strangers to the Energy of that noble Species of Poetry  Shakespear  who has given such amazing Proofs of his Genius in that as well as in Comedy in his  Hamlet  has the following Lines  Had he the Motive and the Cause for Passion  That I have he wou'd drown the Stage with Tears  And cleave the general Ear with horrid Speech  Make mad the Guilty and appale the Free  Confound the Ignorant and amaze indeed  The very Faculty of Eyes and Ears  And farther in the same Speech  I've heard that guilty Creatures at a Play  Have by the very cunning of the Scene  Been so struck to the Soul that presently  They have proclaim'd their Malefactions  Prodigious yet strictly just But I shan't take up your valuable Time with my Remarks only give me Leave just to observe that he seems so firmly perswaded of the Power of a well wrote Piece to produce the Effect here ascribed to it as to make  Hamlet  venture his Soul on the Event and rather trust that than a Messenger from the other World tho' it assumed as he expresses it his noble Father's Form and assured him that it was his Spirit I'll have says  Hamlet  Grounds more relative  The Play's the Thing  Wherein I'll catch the Conscience of the King  Such Plays are the best Answers to them who deny the Lawfulness of the Stage  Considering the Novelty of this Attempt I thought it would be expected from me to say something in its Excuse and I was unwilling to lose the Opportunity of saying something of the Usefulness of Tragedy in general and what may be reasonably expected from the farther Improvement of this excellent Kind of Poetry  Sir I hope you will not think I have said too much of an Art a mean Specimen of which I am ambitious enough to recommend to your Favour and Protection A Mind conscious of superior Worth as much despises Flattery as it is above it Had I found in my self an Inclination to so contemptible a Vice I should not have chose Sir JOHN EYLES for my Patron And indeed the best writ Panegyrick tho'  strictly true must place you in a Light much inferior to that in which you have long been fix'd by the Love and Esteem of your Fellow Citizens whose Choice of you for one of their Representatives in Parliament has sufficiently declared their Sense of your Merit Nor hath the Knowledge of your Worth been confined to the City The Proprietors in the  SouthSea  Company in which are included Numbers of Persons as considerable for their Rank Fortune and Understanding as any in the Kingdom gave the greatest Proof of their Confidence in your Capacity and Probity when they chose you SubGovernor of their Company at a Time when their Affairs were in the utmost Confusion and their Properties in the greatest Danger Nor is the Court insensible of your Importance I shall not therefore attempt your Character nor pretend to add any Thing to a Reputation so well established  Whatever others may think of a Dedication wherein there is so much said of other Things and so little of the Person to whom it is address'd I have Reason to believe that you will the more easily pardon it on that very Account  I am SIR Your most

Thorowgood  and  Trueman  Tr  _SIR the Packet from  Genoa  is arriv'd    Gives Letters  Thor  Heav'n be praised the Storm that threaten'd our Royal Mistress pure Religion Liberty and Laws is for a Time diverted the haughty and revengeful  Spaniard  disappointed of the Loan on which he depended from  Genoa  must now attend the slow return of Wealth from his new World to supply his empty Coffers e'er he can execute his purpos'd Invasion of our happy Island by which means Time is gain'd to make such Preparations on our Part as may Heav'n concurring prevent his Malice or turn the meditated Mischief on himself  Tr  He must be insensible indeed who is not affected when the Safety of his Country is concern'dSir may I know by what meansif I am too bold  Thor  Your Curiosity is laudable and I gratify it with the greater Pleasure because from thence you may learn how honest Merchants as such may sometimes contribute to the Safety of their Country as they do at all times to its Happiness that if hereafter you should be tempted to any Action that has the Appearance of Vice or Meanness in it upon reflecting on the Dignity of our Profession you may with honest Scorn reject whatever is unworthy of it  Tr  Shou'd  Barnwell  or I who have the Benefit of your Example by our ill Conduct bring any Imputation on that honourable Name we must be left without excuse  Thor  You complement young Man  Trueman  bows respectfully    Nay I'm not offended As the Name of Merchant never degrades the Gentleman so by no means does it exclude him only take heed not to purchase the Character of Complai  ant at the Expence of your SincerityBut to answer your QuestionThe Bank of  Genoa  had agreed at excessive Interest and on good Security to advance the King of  Spain  a Sum of Money sufficient to equip his vast Armadoof which our peerless  Elizabeth  more than in Name the Mother of her People being well informed sent  Walsingham  her wise and faithful Secretary to consult the Merchants of this loyal City who all agreed to direct their several Agents to influence if possible the  Genoese  to break their Contract with the  Spanish  Court 'Tis done the State and Bank of  Genoa  having maturely weigh'd and rightly judged of their true Interest prefer the Friendship of the Merchants of  London  to that of a Monarch who proudly stiles himself King of both  Indies    Tr  Happy Success of prudent Councils What an Expence of Blood and Treasure is here savedExcellent Queen O how unlike to former  Princes who made the Danger of foreign Enemies a Pretence to oppress their Subjects by Taxes great and grievous to be born  Thor  Not so our gracious Queen whose richest Exchequer is her Peoples Love as their Happiness her greatest Glory  Tr  On these Terms to defend us is to make our Protection a Benefit worthy her who confers it and well worth our Acceptance  Tr  Sir have you any Commands for me at this Time  Thor  Only to look carefully over the Files to see whether there are any Tradesmens Bills unpaid and if there are to send and discharge 'em We must not let Artificers lose their Time so useful to the Publick and their Families in unnecessary Attendance  SCENE II  Thorowgood  and  Maria  Th  Well  Maria  have you given Orders for the Entertainment I would have it in some measure worthy the Guests Let there be plenty and of the best that the Courtiers tho' they should deny us Citizens Politeness may at least commend our Hospitality  Ma  Sir I have endeavoured not to wrong your wellknown Generosity by an illtim'd Parsimony  Thor  Nay 'twas a needless Caution I have no cause to doubt your Prudence  Ma  Sir I find my self unfit for Conversation at present I should but increase the Number of the Company without adding to their Satisfaction  Thor  Nay my Child this Melancholy must not be indulged  Ma  Company will but increase it I wish you would dispense with my Absence Solitude best suits my present Temper  Thor  You are not insensible that it is chiefly on your Account these noble Lords do me the Honour so frequently to grace my Board shou'd you be absent the Disappointment may make them repent their Condescension and think their Labour lost  Ma  He that shall think his Time or Honour lost in visiting you can set no real Value on your Daughter's Company whose only Merit is that she is yours The Man of Quality who chuses to converse with a Gentleman and Merchant of your Worth and Character may confer Honour by so doing but he loses none  Thor  Come come  Maria  I need not tell you that a young Gentleman may prefer your Conversation to mine yet intend me no Disrespect at all for tho' he may lose no Honour in my Company 'tis very natural for him to expect more Pleasure in yours I remember the Time when the Company of the greatest and wisest Man in the Kingdom would have been insipid and tiresome to me if it had deprived me of an Opportunity of enjoying your Mother's  Ma  Your's no doubt was as agreeable to her for generous Minds know no Pleasure in Society but where 'tis mutual  Thor  Thou know'st I have no Heir no Child but thee the Fruits of many Years successful Industry must all be thine now it would give me Pleasure great as my Love to see on whom you would bestow it I am daily solicited by Men of the greatest Rank and Merit for leave to address you but I have hitherto declin'd it in hopes that by Observation I shou'd learn which way your Inclination tends for as I know Love to be essential to Happiness in the Marriage State I had rather my Approbation should confirm your Choice than direct it  Ma  What can I say How shall I answer as I ought this Tenderness so uncommon even in the best of Parents But you are without Example  yet had you been less indulgent I had been most wretched That I look on the Croud of Courtiers that visit here with equal Esteem but equal Indifference you have observed and I must needs confess yet had you asserted your Authority and insisted on a Parent's Right to be obey'd I had submitted and to my Duty sacrificed my Peace  Thor  From your perfect Obedience in every other Instance I fear'd as much and therefore wou'd leave you without a Byass in an Affair wherein your Happiness is so immediately concern'd  Ma  Whether from a Want of that just Ambition that wou'd become your Daughter or from some other Cause I know not but I find high Birth and Titles don't recommend the Man who owns them to my Affections  Thor  I wou'd not that they shou'd unless his Merit recommends him more A noble Birth and Fortune tho' they make not a bad Man good yet they are a real Advantage to a worthy one and place his Virtues in the fairest Light  Ma  I cannot answer for my Inclinations but they shall ever be submitted to your Wisdom and Authority and as you will not compel me to marry where I cannot love so Love shall never make me act contrary to my Duty Sir have I your Permission to retire  Thor  I'll see you to your Chamber  SCENE III  A Room in  Millwood  's House  Millwood Lucy  Waiting    Mill  How do I look to Day  Lucy  Lucy  O killingly MadamA little more Red and you'll be irresistibleBut why this more than ordinary Care of your Dress and Complexion What new Conquest are you aiming at  Mill  A Conquest wou'd be new indeed  Lucy  Not to you who make 'em every Daybut to meWell 'tis what I'm never to expectunfortunate as I amBut your Wit and Beauty  Mill  First made me a Wretch and still continue me soMen however generous or sincere to one another are all selfish Hypocrites in their Affairs with us We are no otherwise esteemed or regarded by them but as we contribute to their Satisfaction  Lucy  You are certainly Madam on the wrong Side in this Argument Is not the Expence all theirs And I am sure it is our own Fault if we hav'n't our Share of the Pleasure  Mill  We are but Slaves to Men  Lucy  Nay 'tis they that are Slaves most certainly for we lay them under Contribution  Mill  Slaves have no Property no not even in themselvesAll is the Victors  Lucy  You are strangely arbitrary in your Principles Madam  Mill  I would have my Conquests compleat like those of the  Spaniards  in the New World who first plunder'd the Natives of all the Wealth they had and then condemn'd the Wretches to the Mines for Life to work for more  Lucy  Well I shall never approve of your Scheme of Government I should think it much more politick as well as just to find my Subjects an easier Imployment  Mill  It's a general Maxim among the knowing Part of Mankind that a Woman without Virtue like a Man without Honour or Honesty is capable of any Action tho' never so vile And yet what Pains will they not take what Arts not use to seduce us from our Innocence and make us contemptible and wicked even in their own Opinions Then is it not just the Villains to their Cost should find us soBut Guilt makes them suspicious and keeps them on their Guard therefore we can take Advantage  only of the young and innocent Part of the Sex who having never injured Women apprehend no Injury from them  Lucy  Ay they must be young indeed  Mill  Such a one I think I have foundAs I've passed thro' the City I have often observ'd him receiving and paying considerable Sums of Money from thence I conclude he is employ'd in Affairs of Consequence  Lucy  Is he handsome  Mill  Ay ay the Stripling is well made  Lucy  About  Mill  Eighteen  Lucy  Innocent Handsome and about EighteenYou'll be vastly happyWhy if you manage well you may keep him to your self these two or three Years  Mill  If I manage well I shall have done with him much sooner having long had a Design on him and meeting him Yesterday I made a full Stop and gazing wishfully on his Face ask'd him his Name He blush'd and bowing very low answer'd  George Barnwell  I beg'd his Pardon for the Freedom I had taken and told him that he was the Person I had long wish'd to see and to whom I had an Affair of Importance to communicate at a proper Time and Place He named a Tavern I talk'd of Honour and Reputation and invited him to my House He swallow'd the Bait promis'd to come and this is the Time I expect him    knocking at the Door    Some Body knocksd'ye hear I am at Home to no Body to Day but him  SCENE IV  Millwood  Mill  Less Affairs must give Way to those of more Consequence and I am strangely mistaken if  this does not prove of great Importance to me and him too before I have done with himNow after what Manner shall I receive him Let me considerwhat manner of Person am I to receiveHe is young innocent and bashful therefore I must take Care not to shock him at firstBut then if I have any Skill in Phisiognomy he is amorous and with a little Assistance will soon get the better of his ModestyI'll trust to Nature who does Wonders in these MattersIf to seem what one is not in order to be the better liked for what one really is if to speak one thing and mean the direct contrary be Art in a Woman I know nothing of Nature  SCENE V  To her  Barnwell  bowing very low  Lucy  at a Distance    Mill  Sir the Surprize and Joy  Barn  Madam  Mill  This is such a Favour    advancing  Barn  Pardon me Madam  Mill  So unhop'd for    still advances  Barnwell  salutes her and retires in Confusion    Mill  To see you hereExcuse the Confusion  Barn  I fear I am too bold  Mill  Alas Sir All my Apprehensions proceed from my Fears of your thinking me soPlease Sir to sitI am as much at a Loss how to receive this Honour as I ought as I am surpriz'd at your Goodness in confering it  Barn  I thought you had expected meI promis'd to come  Mill  That is the more surprizing few Men are such religious Observers of their Word  Barn  All who are honest are  Mill  To one anotherBut we silly Women are seldom thought of Consequence enough to gain a Place in your Remembrance    Laying her Hand on his as by Accident  Barn  Her Disorder is so great she don't perceive she has laid her Hand on mineHeaven how she tremblesWhat can this mean    Aside  Mill  The Interest I have in all that relates to you the Reason of which you shall know hereafter excites my Curiosity and were I sure you would pardon my Presumption I should desire to know your real Sentiments on a very particular Affair  Barn  Madam you may command my poor Thoughts on any SubjectI have none that I would conceal  Mill  You'll think me bold  Barn  No indeed  Mill  What then are your Thoughts of Love  Barn  If you mean the Love of Women I have not thought of it allMy Youth and Circumstances make such Thoughts improper in me yet But if you mean the general Love we owe to Mankind I think no one has more of it in his Temper than my selfI don't know that Person in the World whose Happiness I don't wish and wou'd n't promote were it in my PowerIn an especial manner I love my Uncle and my Master but above all my Friend  Mill  You have a Friend then whom you love  Barn  As he does me sincerely  Mill  He is no doubt often bless'd with your Company and Conversation  Barn  We live in one House together and both serve the same worthy Merchant  Mill  Happy happy Youthwho e'er thou art I envy thee and so must all who see and know this YouthWhat have I lost by being form'd a WomanI hate my Sex my selfHad I been a Man I might perhaps have been as happy  in your Friendship as he who now enjoys itBut as it isOh  Barn  I never observ'd Women before or this is sure the most beautiful of her Sex    Aside    You seem disorder'd Madam May I know the Cause  Mill  Do not ask meI can never speak it whatever is the CauseI wish for Things impossibleI wou'd be a Servant bound to the same Master as you are to live in one House with you  Barn  How strange and yet how kind her Words and Actions areAnd the Effect they have on me is as strangeI feel Desires I never knew beforeI must be gone while I have Power to go    Aside    Madam I humbly take my Leave  Mill  You will not sure leave me so soon  Barn  Indeed I must  Mill  You cannot be so cruelI have prepar'd a poor Supper at which I promis'd my self your Company  Barn  I am sorry I must refuse the Honour that you design'd meBut my Duty to my Master calls me henceI never yet neglected his Service He is so gentle and so good a Master that should I wrong him tho' he might forgive me I never should forgive my self  Mill  Am I refus'd by the first Man the second Favour I ever stoop'd to askGo then thou proud hardhearted YouthBut know you are the only Man that cou'd be found who would let me sue twice for greater Favours  Barn  What shall I doHow shall I go or stay  Mill  Yet do not do not leave meI wish my Sex's Pride wou'd meet your ScornBut when I look upon youWhen I behold those EyesOh spare my Tongue and let my Blushes speakThis Flood of Tears to that will force their way  and declarewhat Woman's Modesty should hide  Barn  Oh Heavens she loves me worthless as I am her Looks her Words her flowing Tears confess itAnd can I leave her thenOh neverneverMadam dry up those TearsYou shall command me alwaysI will stay here for ever if you'd have me  Lucy  So she has wheedled him out of his Virtue of Obedience already and will strip him of all the rest one after another 'till she has left him as few as her Ladyship or my self    Aside  Mill  Now you are kind indeed but I mean not to detain you always I would have you shake off all slavish Obedience to your Masterbut you may serve him still  Lucy  Serve him stillAye or he'll have no Opportunity of fingering his Cash and then he'll not serve your End I'll be sworn    Aside  SCENE VI    To them  Blunt  Blunt  Madam Supper's on the Table  Mill  Come Sir You'll excuse all DefectsMy Thoughts were too much employ'd on my Guest to observe the Entertainment  SCENE VII  Lucy  and  Blunt  Blunt  What is all this Preparation this elegant Supper Variety of Wines and Musick for the Entertainment of that young Fellow  Lucy  So it seems  Blunt  What is our Mistress turn'd Fool at last She's in Love with him I suppose  Lucy  I suppose notbut she designs to make him in Love with her if she can  Blunt  What will she get by that He seems under Age and can't be suppos'd to have much Money  Lucy  But his Master has and that's the same thing as she'll manage it  Blunt  I don't like this fooling with a handsome young Fellow while she's endeavouring to ensnare him she may be caught her self  Lucy  Nay were she like me that would certainly be the Consequencefor I confess there is something in Youth and Innocence that moves me mightily  Blunt  Yes so does the Smoothness and Plumpness of a Patridge move a mighty Desire in the Hawk to be the Destruction of it  Lucy  Why Birds are their Prey as Men are ours though as you observ'd we are sometimes caught our selvesBut that I dare say will never be the Case with our Mistress  Blunt  I wish it may prove so for you know we all depend upon her Should she trifle away her Time with a young Fellow that there's nothing to be got by we must all starve  Lucy  There's no Danger of that for I am sure she has no View in this Affair but Interest  Blunt  Well and what Hopes are there of Success in that  Lucy  The most promising that can be'Tis true the Youth has his Scruples but she'll soon teach him to answer them by stifling his ConscienceO the Lad is in a hopeful Way depend upon't  SCENE VIII  Barnwell  and  Millwood  at an Entertainment    Barn  What can I answerAll that I know is that you are fair and I am miserable  Mill  We are both so and yet the Fault is in our selves  Barn  To ease our present Anguish by plunging into Guilt is to buy a Moment's Pleasure with an Age of Pain  Mill  I should have thought the Joys of Love as lasting as they are great If ours prove otherwise 'tis your Inconstancy must make them so  Barn  The Law of Heaven will not be revers'd and that requires us to govern our Passions  Mill  To give us Sense of Beauty and Desires and yet forbid us to taste and be happy is Cruelty to NatureHave we Passions only to torment us  Barn  To hear you talktho' in the Cause of Viceto gaze upon your Beautypress your Handand see your Snowwhite Bosom heave and fallenflames my Wishesmy Pulse beats highmy Senses all are in a Hurry and I am on the Rack of wild Desireyet for a Moment's guilty Pleasure shall I lose my Innocence my Peace of Mind and Hopes of solid Happiness  Mill  Chimeras all  Come on with me and prove  No Joy's like Woman kind nor Heav'n like Love  Barn  I wou'd notyet I must on  Reluctant thus the Merchant quits his Ease  And trusts to Rocks and Sands and stormy Seas  In Hopes some unknown golden Coast to find  Commits himself tho' doubtful to the Wind  Longs much for Joys to come yet mourns those left behind  The End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE I  A Room in  Thorowgood  's House    Barnwell  Barn  HOW strange are all Things round me Like some Thief who treads forbidden Ground fearful I enter each Apartment of this well known House To guilty Love as if that was too little already have I added Breach of TrustA ThiefCan I know my self that wretched Thing and look my honest Friend and injured Master in the FaceTho' Hypocrisy may a while conceal my Guilt at length it will be known and publick Shame and Ruin must ensue In the mean time what must be my Life ever to speak a Language foreign to my Heart hourly to add to the Number of my Crimes in order to conceal 'emSure such was the Condition of the grand Apostate when first he lost his Purity like me disconsolate he wander'd and while yet in Heaven bore all his future Hell about him  SCENE II  Barnwell  and  Trueman  Tr  Barnwell  O how I rejoice to see you safe so will our Master and his gentle Daughter who during your Absence often inquir'd after you  Barn  Wou'd he were gone his officious Love will pry into the Secrets of my Soul    Aside  Tr  Unless you knew the Pain the whole Family has felt on your Account you can't conceive how much you are belov'd but why thus cold and silent when my Heart is full of Joy for your Return why do you turn away why thus avoid me what have I done how am I alter'd since you saw me last Or rather what have you done and why are you thus changed for I am still the same  Barn  What have I done indeed    Aside  Tr  Not speak nor look upon me  Barn  By my Face he will discover all I wou'd conceal methinks already I begin to hate him    Aside  Tr  I cannot bear this Usage from a Friend one whom till now I ever found so loving whom yet I love tho' this Unkindness strikes at the Root of Friendship and might destroy it in any Breast but mine  Bar  I am not well    Turning to him  Sleep has been a Stranger to these Eyes since you beheld them last  Tr  Heavy they look indeed and swoln with Tearsnow they o'erflowrightly did my sympathizing Heart forebode last Night when thou wast absent something fatal to our Peace  Barn  Your Friendship ingages you too far My Troubles whate'er they are are mine alone you have no Interest in them nor ought your Concern for me give you a Moment's Pain  Tr  You speak as if you knew of Friendship nothing but the Name Before I saw your Grief I felt it Since we parted last I have slept no more than you but pensive in my Chamber sat alone and spent the tedious Night in Wishes for your Safety and Return e'en now tho' ignorant of the Cause your Sorrow wounds me to the Heart  Barn  'Twill nor be always thus Friendship and all Engagements cease as Circumstances and Occasions vary and since you once may hate me perhaps it might be better for us both that now you lov'd me less  Tr  Sure I but dream without a Cause would  Barnwell  use me thus ungenerous and ungrateful Youth farewellI shall endeavour to follow your Advice    Going    Yet stay perhaps I am too rash and angry when the Cause demands Compassion Some unforeseen Calamity may have befaln him too great to bear  Barn  What Part am I reduc'd to act'tis vile and base to move his Temper thus the best of Friends and Men  Tr  I am to blame prithee forgive me  Barnwell  Try to compose your ruffled Mind and let me know the Cause that thus transports you from your Self my friendly Counsel may restore your Peace  Barn  All that is possible for Man to do for Man your generous Friendship may effect but here even that's in Vain  Tr  Something dreadful is labouring in your Breast O give it vent and let me share your Grief 'twill ease your Pain shou'd it admit no cure and make it lighter by the Part I bear  Barn  Vain Supposition my Woes increase by being observ'd shou'd the Cause be known they wou'd exceed all Bounds  Tr  So well I know thy honest Heart Guilt cannot harbour there  Barn  O Torture insupportable    Aside  Tr  Then why am I excluded have I a Thought I would conceal from you  Barn  If still you urge me on this hated Subject I'll never enter more beneath this Roof nor see your Face again  Tr  'Tis strangebut I have done say but you hate me not  Barn  Hate youI am not that Monster yet  Tr  Shall our Friendship still continue  Barn  It's a Blessing I never was worthy of yet now must stand on Terms and but upon Conditions can confirm it  Tr  What are they  Barn  Never hereafter tho' you shou'd wonder at my Conduct desire to know more than I am willing to reveal  Tr  'Tis hard but upon any Conditions I must be your Friend  Barn  Then as much as one lost to himself can be another's I am yours    Embracing  Tr  Be ever so and may Heav'n restore your Peace  Bar  Will Yesterday returnWe have heard the glorious Sun that till then incessant roll'd once stopp'd his rapid Course and once went back The Dead have risen and parched Rocks pour'd forth a liquid Stream to quench a Peoples Thirst The Sea divided and form'd Walls of Water while a whole Nation pass'd in safety thro' its sandy Bosom Hungry Lions have refus'd their Prey And Men unhurt have walk'd amidst consuming Flames but never yet did Time once past return  Tr  Tho' the continued Chain of Time has never once been broke nor ever will but uninterrupted must keep on its Course till lost in Eternity it ends there where it first begun yet as Heav'n can repair whatever Evils Time can bring upon us he who trusts Heaven ought never to despair But Business requires our Attendance Business the Youth's best Preservative from ill as Idleness his worst of Snares Will you go with me  Barn  I'll take a little Time to reflect on what has past and follow you  SCENE III  Barnwell  I might have trusted  Trueman  to have applied to my Uncle to have repaired the Wrong I have done  my Master but what of  Millwood  must I expose her too ungenerous and base then Heav'n requires it notBut Heaven requires that I forsake her What never see her more Does Heaven require thatI hope I may see her and Heav'n not be offended Presumptuous Hopedearly already have I prov'd my Frailty should I once more tempt Heav'n I may be left to fall never to rise again Yet shall I leave her for ever leave her and not let her know the Cause She who loves me with such a boundless Passion can Cruelty be Duty I judge of what she then must feel by what I now indure The love of Life and fear of Shame oppos'd by Inclination strong as Death or Shame like Wind and Tide in raging Conflict met when neither can prevail keep me in doubtHow then can I determines  SCENE IV  Thorowgood  and  Barnwell  Thor  Without a Cause assign'd or Notice given to absent your self last Night was a Fault young Man and I came to chide you for it but hope I am prevented that modest Blush the Confusion so visible in your Face speak Grief and Shame When we have offended Heaven it requires no more and shall Man who needs himself to be forgiven be harder to

abuse your mistaken Bounty to receive 'em Tho' I had rather die than speak my Shame tho' Racks could not have forced the guilty Secret from my Breast your Kindness has  Thor  Enough enough whate'er it be this Concern shews you're convinc'd and I am satisfied  How painful is the Sense of Guilt to an ingenuous Mindsome youthful Folly which it were prudent not to enquire intoWhen we consider the frail Condition of Humanity it may raise our Pity not our Wonder that Youth should go astray when Reason weak at the best when oppos'd to Inclination scarce form'd and wholly unassisted by Experience faintly contends or willingly becomes the Slave of Sense The State of Youth is much to be deplored and the more so because they see it not they being then to danger most expos'd when they are least prepar'd for their Defence  Barn  It will be known and you recall your Pardon and abhor me  Thor  I never will so Heav'n confirm to me the Pardon of my Offences Yet be upon your Guard in this gay thoughtless Season of your Life now when the Sense of Pleasure's quick and Passion high the voluptuous Appetites raging and fierce demand the strongest Curb take heed of a Relapse When Vice becomes habitual the very Power of leaving it is lost  Barn  Hear me then on my Knees confess  Thor  I will not hear a Syllable more upon this Subject it were not Mercy but Cruelty to hear what must give you such Torment to reveal  Barn  This Generosity amazes and distracts me  Thor  This Remorse makes thee dearer to me than if thou hadst never offended whatever is your Fault of this I'm certain 'twas harder for you to offend than me to pardon  SCENE V  Barnwell  Barn  Villain Villain Villain basely to wrong so excellent a Man Shou'd I again return to Follydetested Thoughtbut what of  Millwood  thenWhy I renounce herI give her upthe Struggle's over and Virtue has prevail'd Reason may convince but Gratitude compels This unlook'd for Generosity has sav'd me from Destruction    Going  SCENE VI

Unhappy are so every where  Barn  Will nothing but my utter Ruin content you  Mill  Unkind and cruel lost my self your Happiness is now my only Care  Barn  How did you gain Admission  Mill  Saying we were desir'd by your Uncle to visit and deliver a Message to you we were receiv'd by the Family without suspicion and with much respect directed here  Barn  Why did you come at all  Mill  I never shall trouble you more I'm come to take my Leave for ever Such is the Malice of my Fate I go hopeless despairing ever to return This Hour is all I have left me One short Hour is all I have to bestow on Love and you for whom I thought the longest Life too short  Barn  Then we are met to part for ever  Mill  It must be soyet think not that Time or Absence ever shall put a Period to my Grief or make me love you less tho' I must leave you yet condemn me not  Barn  Condemn you No I approve your Resolution and rejoice to hear it 'tis just'tis necessaryI have well weigh'd and found it so  Lucy  I'm afraid the young Man has more Sense than she thought he had    Aside  Barn  Before you came I had determin'd never to see you more  Mill  Confusion    Aside  Lucy  Ay we are all out this is a Turn so unexpected that I shall make nothing of my Part they must e'en play the Scene betwixt themselves    Aside  Mill  'Twas some relief to think tho' absent you would love me still but to find tho' Fortune had been kind that you more cruel and inconstant had resolv'd to cast me offThis as I never cou'd expect I have not learnt to bear  Barn  I am sorry to hear you blame in me a Resolution that so well becomes us both  Mill  I have Reason for what I do but you have none  Barn  Can we want a Reason for parting who have so many to wish we never had met  Mill  Look on me  Barnwell  am I deform'd or old that Satiety so soon succeeds Enjoyment nay look again am I not she whom Yesterday you thought the fairest and the kindest of her Sex whose Hand trembling with Extacy you prest and moulded thus while on my Eyes you gazed with such delight as if Desire increas'd by being fed  Barn  No more let me repent my former Follies if possible without remembring what they were  Mill  Why  Barn  Such is my Frailty that 'tis dangerous  Mill  Where is the Danger since we are to part  Barn  The Thought of that already is too painful  Mill  If it be painful to part then I may hope at least you do not hate me  Barn  NonoI never said I didO my Heart  Mill  Perhaps you pity me  Barn  I doI doindeed I do  Mill  You'll think upon me  Barn  Doubt it not while I can think at all  Mill  You may judge an Embrace at parting too great a Favour though it would be the last    He draws back    A Look shall then sufficefarewell for ever  SCENE X  Barnwell  Barn  If to resolve to suffer be to conquer I have conquer'd Painful Victory  SCENE XI  Barnwell Millwood  and  Lucy  Mill  One thing I had forgotI never must return to my own House again This I thought proper to let you know lest your Mind should change and you shou'd seek in vain to find me there Forgive me this second Intrusion I only came to give you this Caution and that perhaps was needless  Barn  I hope it was yet it is kind and I must thank you for it  Mill  My Friend your Arm    To  Lucy  Now I am gone for ever    Going  Barn  One thing moresure there's no danger in my knowing where you go If you think otherwise  Mill  Alas    Weeping  Lucy  We are right I find that's my Cue    Aside  Ah dear Sir she's going she knows not whether but go she must  Barn  Humanity obliges me to wish you well why will you thus expose your self to needless Troubles  Lucy  Nay there's no help for it She must quit the Town immediately and the Kingdom as soon as possible it was no small Matter you may be sure that could make her resolve to leave you  Mill  No more my Friend since he for whose dear Sake alone I suffer and am content to suffer is kind and pities me Wheree'er I wander through Wiles and Desarts benighted and forlorn that Thought shall give me comfort  Barn  For my Sake O tell me how which way am I so curs'd as to bring such Ruin on thee  Mill  No matter I am contented with my Lot  Barn  Leave me not in this Incertainty  Mill  I have said too much  Barn  How how am I the Cause of your Undoing  Mill  'Twill but increase your Troubles  Barn  My Troubles can't be greater than they are  Lucy  Well well Sir if she won't satisfy you I will  Barn  I am bound to you beyond Expression  Mill  Remember Sir that I desir'd you not to hear it  Barn  Begin and ease my racking Expectation  Lucy  Why you must know my Lady here was an only Child but her Parents dying while she was young left her and her Fortune no inconsiderable one I assure you to the Care of a Gentleman who has a good Estate of his own  Mill  Ay ay the barbarous Man is rich enoughbut what are Riches when compared to Love  Lucy  For a while he perform'd the Office of a faithful Guardian settled her in a House hir'd her Servantsbut you have seen in what manner she liv'd so I need say no more of that  Mill  How I shall live hereafter Heaven knows  Lucy  All Things went on as one cou'd wish till some Time ago his Wife dying he fell violently in love with his Charge and wou'd fain have marry'd her Now the Man is neither old nor ugly but a good personable sort of a Man but I don't know how it was she cou'd never endure him in short her ill Usage so provok'd him that he brought in an Account of his Executorship wherein he makes her Debtor to him  Mill  A Trifle in it self but more than enough to ruin me whom by this unjust Account he had stripp'd of all before  Lucy  Now she having neither Money nor Friend except me who am as unfortunate as her self he compell'd her to pass his Account and give Bond for the Sum he demanded but still provided handsomely for her and continued his Courtship till being inform'd by his Spies truly I suspect some  in her own Family that you were entertain'd at her House and stay'd with her all Night he came this Morning raving and storming like a Madman talks no more of Marriage so there's no Hopes of making up Matters that Way but vows her Ruin unless she'll allow him the same Favour that he supposes she granted you  Barn  Must she be ruin'd or find her Refuge in another's Arms  Mill  He gave me but an Hour to resolve in that's happily spent with youand now I go  Barn  To be expos'd to all the Rigours of the various Seasons the Summer's parching Heat and Winter's Cold unhous'd to wander Friendless thro' the unhospitable World in Misery and Want attended with Fear and Danger and pursu'd by Malice and Revenge woud'st thou endure all this for me and can I do nothing nothing to prevent it  Lucy  'Tis really a Pity there can be no Way found out  Barn  O where are all my Resolutions now like early Vapours or the Morning Dew chas'd by the Sun's warm Beams they're vanish'd and lost as tho' they had never been  Lucy  Now I advis'd her Sir to comply with the Gentleman that wou'd not only put an End to her Troubles but make her Fortune at once  Barn  Tormenting Fiend awayI had rather perish nay see her perish than have her sav'd by him I will my self prevent her Ruin tho' with my own A Moment's Patience I'll return immediately  SCENE XII  Millwood  and  Lucy  Lucy  'Twas well you came or by what I can perceive you had lost him  Mill  That I must confess was a Danger I did not foresee I was only afraid he should have come without Money You know a House of Entertainment like mine is not kept with nothing  Lucy  That's very true but then you shou'd be reasonable in your Demands 'tis pity to discourage a young Man  SCENE XIII  Barnwell Millwood  and  Lucy  Barn  What am I about to doNow you who boast your Reason allsufficient suppose your selves in my Condition and determine for me whether it's right to let her suffer for my Faults or by this small Addition to my Guilt prevent the ill Effects of what is past  Lucy  These young Sinners think every Thing in the Ways of Wickedness so strangebut I cou'd tell him that this is nothing but what's very common for one Vice as naturally begets another as a Father a SonBut he'll find out that himself if he lives long enough  Barn  Here take this and with it purchase your Deliverance return to your House and live in Peace and Safety  Mill  So I may hope to see you there again  Barn  Answer me notbut flyleast in the Agonies of my Remorse I take again what is not mine to give and abandon thee to Want and Misery  Mill  Say but you'll come  Barn  You are my Fate my Heaven or my Hell only leave me now dispose of me hereafter as you please  SCENE XIV  Barnwell  What have I doneWere my Resolutions founded on Reason and sincerely madewhy then has Heaven suffer'd me to fall I sought not the Occasion and if my Heart deceives me not Compassion and Generosity were my MotivesIs Virtue inconsistent with it self or are Vice and Virtue only empty Names Or do they depend on Accidents beyond our Power to produce or to preventwherein we have no Part and yet must be determin'd by the EventBut why should I attempt to reason All is Confusion Horror and RemorseI find I am lost cast down from all my late erected Hopes and plung'd again in Guilt yet scarce know how or why  Such undistinguish'd Horrors make my Brain  Like Hell the Seat of Darkness and of Pain  The End of the Second Act  ACT

Pains to study it as a ScienceSee how it is founded in Reason and the Nature of ThingsHow it has promoted Humanity as it has opened and yet keeps up an Intercourse between Nations far remote from one

Assistance to extend my Thoughts much fartherI have observ'd those Countries where Trade is promoted and encouraged do not make Discoveries to destroy but to improve Mankindby Love and Friendship to tame the fierce and polish the most savageto teach them the Advantages of honest Traffickby taking from them with their own Consent their useless Superfluities and giving them in Return what from

thought in some ConfusionIf you please I'll go and hasten himI hope he has n't been guilty of any Neglect  Thor  I'm now going to the  Exchange  let him know at my Return I expect to find him ready

surprize my honour'd Master and your self and the more when you shall understand that the Reason of my withdrawing is my having embezzled part of the Cash with which I was entrusted After this 'tis needless to inform you that I intend never to return again Though this might have been known by examining my Accounts yet to prevent that unnecessary Trouble and to cut off all fruitless Expectations of my Return I have left this from the lost  George Barnwell  Tr  Lost indeed Yet how he shou'd be guilty of what he there charges himself withal raises my Wonder equal to my GriefNever had Youth a higher Sense of VirtueJustly he thought and as he thought he practised never was Life more regular than his an Understanding uncommon at his Years an open generous manliness of Temper his Manners easy unaffected and engaging  Ma  This and much more you might have said with TruthHe was the delight of every Eye and Joy of every Heart that knew him  Tr  Since such he was and was my Friend can I support his LossSee the fairest and happiest Maid this wealthy City boasts kindly condescends to weep for thy unhappy Fate poor ruin'd  Barnwell  Ma  Trueman  Do you think a Soul so delicate as his so sensible of Shame can e'er submit to live a Slave to Vice  Tr  Never never So well I know him I'm sure this Act of his so contrary to his Nature must have been caused by some unavoidable Necessity  Ma  Is there no Means yet to preserve him  Tr  O that there wereBut few Men recover Reputation lostA Merchant neverNor wou'd he I fear though I shou'd find him ever be brought to look his injur'd Master

Will you save a helpless Wretch from Ruin Oh 'twere an Act worthy such exalted Virtue as  Maria  'sSure Heaven in Mercy to my Friend inspired the generous Thought  Ma  Doubt not but I wou'd purchase so great a Happiness at a much dearer PriceBut how shall he be found  Tr  Trust to my Diligence for thatIn the mean time I'll conceal his Absence from your Father or find such Excuses for it that the real Cause shall never be suspected  Ma  In attempting to save from Shame one whom we hope may yet return to Virtue to Heaven and you the Judges of this Action I appeal whether I have done any thing misbecoming my Sex and Character  Tr  Earth must approve the Deed and Heaven I doubt not will reward it  Ma  If Heaven succeed it I am well rewarded A Virgin's Fame is sullied by Suspicion's slightest Breath and therefore as this must be a Secret from my Father and the World for  Barnwell  's sake for mine let it be so to him  SCENE IV  Milwood  's House  Lucy  and  Blunt  Lucy  Well what do you think of  Millwood  's Conduct now  Blunt  I own it is surprizingI don't know which to admire most her feign'd or his real Passion tho' I have sometimes been afraid that her Avarice wou'd discover herBut his Youth and want of Experience make it the easier to impose on him  Lucy  No it is his Love To do him Justice notwithstanding his Youth he don't want Understanding but you Men are much easier imposed on in these Affairs than your Vanity will allow you to believeLet me see the wisest of you all as much in Love with me as  Barnwell  is with  Millwood  and I'll engage to make as great a Fool of him  Blunt  And all Circumstances consider'd to make as much Money of him too  Lucy  I can't answer for that Her Artifice in making him rob his Master at first and the various Stratagems by which she has obliged him to continue in that Course astonish even me who know her so well  Blunt  But then you are to consider that the Money was his Master's  Lucy  There was the Difficulty of itHad it been his own it had been nothingWere the World his she might have it for a SmileBut those golden Days are donehe's ruin'd and  Millwood  's Hopes of farther Profits there are at an End  Blunt  That's no more than we all expected  Lucy  Being call'd by his Master to make up his Accounts he was forc'd to quit his House and Service and wisely flies to  Millwood  for Relief and Entertainment  Blunt  I have not heard of this before How did she receive him  Lucy  As you wou'd expectShe wonder'd what he meant was astonish'd at his Impudenceand with an Air of Modesty peculiar to her self swore so heartily that she never saw him beforethat she put me out of Countenance  Blunt  That's much indeed But how did  Barnwell  behave  Lucy  He griev'd and at length enrag'd at this barbarous Treatment was preparing to be gone and making toward the Door show'd a Bag of Money which he had stol'n from his Masterthe last he's ever like to have from thence  Blunt  But then  Millwood  Lucy  Aye she with her usual Address return'd to her old Arts of lying swearing and dissemblingHung on his Neck and wept and swore 'twas meant in Jest till this easy Fool melted into Tears threw the Money into her Lap and swore he had rather die than think her false  Blunt  Strange Infatuation  Lucy  But what follow'd was stranger still As Doubts and Fears follow'd by Reconcilement ever increase Love where the Passion is sincere so in him it caus'd so wild a Transport of excessive  Fondness such Joy such Grief such Pleasure and such Anguish that Nature in him seem'd sinking with the Weight and the charm'd Soul dispos'd to quit his Breast for hersjust then when every Passion with lawless Anarchy prevail'dand Reason was in the raging Tempest lostthe cruel artful  Millwood  prevail'd upon the wretched Youth to promise what I tremble but to think on  Blunt  I am amaz'd what can it be  Lucy  You will be more so to hear it is to attempt the Life of his nearest Relation and best Benefactor  Blunt  His Uncle whom we have often heard him speak of as a Gentleman of a large Estate and fair Character in the Country where he lives  Lucy  The sameShe was no sooner possess'd of the last dear Purchase of his Ruin but her Avarice insatiate as the Grave demands this horrid Sacrifice  Barnwell  's near Relation and unsuspected Virtue must give too easy Means to seize the good Man's Treasure whose Blood must seal the dreadful Secret and prevent the Terrors of her guilty Fears  Blunt  Is it possible she cou'd perswade him to do an Act like that He is by Nature honest grateful compassionate and generous And though his Love and her artful Perswasions have wrought him to practise what he most abhors yet we all can witness for him with what Reluctance he has still comply'd So many Tears he shed o'er each Offence as might if possible sanctify Theft and make a Merit of a Crime  Lucy  'Tis true at the naming the Murder of his Uncle he started into Rage and breaking from her Arms where she till then had held him with well dissembled Love and false Endearments call'd her cruel Monster Devil and told her she was born for his DestructionShe thought it not for her Purpose to meet his Rage with Rage  but affected a most passionate Fit of Griefrail'd at her Fate and curs'd her wayward Starsthat still her Wants shou'd force her to press him to act such Deeds as she must needs abhor as well as he but told him Necessity had no Law and Love no Bounds that therefore he never truly lov'd but meant in her Necessity to forsake herthen kneel'd and swore that since by his Refusal he had given her Cause to doubt his Love she never wou'd see him more unless to prove it true he robb'd his Uncle to supply her Wants and murder'd him to keep it from Discovery  Blunt  I am astonish'd What said he  Lucy  Speechless he stood but in his Face you might have read that various Passions tore his very Soul Oft he in Anguish threw his Eyes towards Heaven and then as often bent their Beams on her then wept and groan'd and beat his Breast at length with Horror not to be express'd he cry'd Thou cursed Fair have I not given dreadful Proofs of Love What drew me from my youthful Innocence to stain my then unspotted Soul but Love What caus'd me to rob my gentle Master but cursed Love What makes me now a Fugitive from his Service loath'd by my self and scorn'd by all the World but Love What fills my Eyes with Tears my Soul with Torture never felt on this side Death before Why Love Love Love And why above all do I resolve for tearing his Hair he cry'd I do resolve to kill my Uncle  Blunt  Was she not mov'd It makes me weep to hear the sad Relation  Lucy  Yes with Joy that she had gain'd her PointShe gave him no Time to cool but urg'd him to attempt it instantly He's now gone if he performs it and escapes there's more Money for her if not he'll ne'er return and then she's fairly rid of him  Blunt  'Tis time the World was rid of such a Monster  Lucy  If we don't do our Endeavours to prevent this Murder we are as bad as she  Blunt  I'm afraid it is too late  Lucy  Perhaps notHer Barbarity to  Barnwell  makes me hate herWe've run too great a Length with her alreadyI did not think her or my self so wicked as I find upon Reflection we are  Blunt  'Tis true we have all been too much soBut there is something so horrid in Murderthat all other Crimes seem nothing when compared to thatI wou'd not be involv'd in the Guilt of that for all the World  Lucy  Nor I Heaven knowstherefore let us clear our selves by doing all that is in our Power to prevent it I have just thought of a Way that to me seems probableWill you join with me to detect this curs'd Design  Blunt  With all my HeartHow else shall I clear my self He who knows of a Murder intended to be committed and does not discover it in the Eye of the Law and Reason is a Murderer  Lucy  Let us lose no TimeI'll acquaint you with the Particulars as we go  SCENE V  A Walk at some Distance from a Country Seat  Barnwell  A dismal Gloom obscures the Face of Day either the Sun has slip'd behind a Cloud or journeys down the West of Heaven with more than common Speed to avoid the Sight of what I'm doom'd to act Since I set forth on this accursed Design where'er I tread methinks the solid Earth trembles beneath my FeetYonder limpid  Stream whose hoary Fall has made a natural Cascade as I pass'd by in doleful Accents seem'd to murmur Murder The Earth the Air and Water seem concern'd but that's not strange the World is punish'd and Nature feels the Shock when Providence permits a good Man's FallJust Heaven Then what shou'd I be for him that was my Father's only Brother and since his Death has been to me a Father who took me up an Infant and an Orphan rear'd me with tenderest Care and still indulged me with most paternal Fondnessyet here I stand avow'd his destin'd MurdererI stiffen with Horror at my own Impiety'tis yet unperform'dWhat if I quit my bloody Purpose and fly the Place    Going then stops    But whether O whether shall I flyMy Master's once friendly Doors are ever shut against me and without Money  Millwood  will never see me more and Life is not to be endured without herShe's got such firm Possession of my Heart and governs there with such despotick SwayAye there's the Cause of all my Sin and Sorrow'Tis more than Love 'tis the Fever of the Soul and Madness of DesireIn vain does Nature Reason Conscience all oppose it the impetuous Passion bears down all before it and drives me on to Lust to Theft and MurderOh Conscience feeble Guide to Virtue who only shows us when we go astray but wants the Power to stop us in our CourseHa in yonder shady Walk I see my UncleHe's aloneNow for my Disguise    Plucks out a Vizor    This is his Hour of private Meditation Thus daily he prepares his Soul for Heavenwhilst IBut what have I to do with HeavenHa No Struggles Conscience  Hence Hence Remorse and ev'ry Thought that's good  The Storm that Lust began must end in Blood    Puts on the Vizor and draws a Pistol  SCENE VI  A close Walk in a Wood  Uncle  If I was superstitious I shou'd fear some Danger lurk'd unseen or Death were nighA heavy Melancholy clouds my Spirits my Imagination is fill'd with gashly Forms of dreary Graves and Bodies chang'd by Deathwhen the pale lengthen'd Visage attracks each weeping Eyeand fills the musing Soul at once with Grief and Horror Pity and AversionI will indulge the Thought The wise Man prepares himself for Death by making it familiar to his MindWhen strong Reflections hold the Mirror nearand the Living in the Dead behold their future selves how does each inordinate Passion and Desire cease or sicken at the ViewThe Mind scarce movesThe Blood curdling and chill'd creeps slowly thro' the Veinsfix'd still and motionless like the solemn Object of our ThoughtsWe are almost at presentwhat we must be hereafter 'till Curiosity awakes the Soul and sets it on Inquiry  SCENE VII  Uncle George Barnwell  at a Distance    Uncle  O Death thou strange mysterious Powerseen every Day yet never understoodbut by the incommunicative Dead What art thouThe extensive Mind of Man that with a Thought circles the Earth's vast Globesinks to the Centre or ascends above the Stars that World's exotick finds or thinks it findsthy  thick Clouds attempts to pass in vain lost and bewilder'd in the horrid Gloomdefeated she returns more doubtful than before of nothing certain but of Labour lost    During this Speech  Barnwell  sometimes presents the Pistol and draws it back again at last he drops itat which his Uncle starts and draws his Sword    Barn  Oh 'tis impossible  Uncle  A Man so near me arm'd and masqu'd  Barn  Nay then there's no Retreat    Plucks a Poniard from his Bosom and stabs him  Uncle  Oh I am slain All gracious Heaven regard the Prayer of thy dying Servant Bless with thy choicest Blessings my dearest Nephew forgive my Murderer and take my fleeting Soul to endless Mercy    Barnwell throws off his Mask runs to him and kneeling by him raises and chafes him  Barn  Expiring Saint Oh murder'd martyr'd Uncle Lift up your dying Eyes and view your Nephew in your MurdererO do not look so tenderly upon meLet Indignation lighten from your Eyes and blast me e're you dieBy Heaven he weeps in Pity of my WoesTearsTears for BloodThe Murder'd in the Agonies of Death weeps for his MurdererO speak your pious Purposepronounce my Pardon thenand take me with youHe wou'd but cannotO why with such fond Affection do you press my murdering HandWhat will you kiss me    Kisses him  Uncle  Groans and dies  Barn  He's gone for everand oh I follow    Swoons away upon his Uncle's dead Body    Do I still live to press the suffering Bosom of the EarthDo I still breath and taint with my infectious Breath the wholesome AirLet Heaven from its high Throne in Justice or in Mercy now look down on  that dear murder'd Saint and me the MurdererAnd if his Vengeance spareslet Pity strike and end my wretched BeingMurder the worst of Crimes and Parricide the worst of Murders and this the worst of Parricides  Cain  who stands on Record from the Birth of Time and must to its last final Period as accurs'd  lew a Brother favour'd above himDetested  Nero  by another's Hand dispatch'd a Mother that he fear'd and hatedBut I with my own Hand have murder'd a Brother Mother Father and a Friend most loving and belov'dThis execrable Act of mine's without a ParallelO may it ever stand alonethe last of Murders as it is the worst  The rich Man thus in Torment and Despair  Prefer'd his vain but charitable Prayer  The Fool his own Soul lost wou'd fain be wise  For others Good but Heaven his Suit denies  By Laws and Means well known we stand or fall  And one eternal Rule remains for all  The End of the Third Act  ACT IV  SCENE I  Maria  Ma  HOW falsly do they judge who censure or applaud as we're afflicted or rewarded here I know I am unhappy yet cannot charge my self with any Crime more than the common Frailties of our Kind that shou'd provoke just Heaven to mark me out for Sufferings so uncommon and severe Falsly to accuse our selves Heaven must abhor then it is just and right that Innocence should suffer for Heaven must be just in all its WaysPerhaps by that they are kept from moral Evils much worse than penal or more improv'd in Virtue Or may not the lesser Ills that they sustain be the Means of greater Good to others Might all the joyless Days and sleepless Nights that I have past but purchase Peace for thee  Thou dear dear Cause of all my Grief and Pain  Small were the Loss and infinite the Gain  Tho' to the Grave in secret Love I pine  So Life and Fame and Happiness were thine  SCENE II  Trueman  and  Maria  Ma  What News of  Barnwell  Tr  NoneI have sought him with the greatest Diligence but all in vain  Ma  Doth my Father yet suspect the Cause of his absenting himself  Tr  All appear'd so just and fair to him it is not possible he ever shou'd but his Absence will no longer be conceal'd Your Father's wise and though he seems to hearken to the friendly Excuses I wou'd make for  Barnwell  yet I am afraid he regards 'em only as such without suffering them to influence his Judgment  Ma  How does the unhappy Youth defeat all our Designs to serve him yet I can never repent what we have done Shou'd he return 'twill make his Reconciliation with my Father easier and preserve him from future Reproach from a malicious unforgiving World  SCENE III    To them  Thorowgood  and  Lucy  Thor  This Woman here has given me a sad and bating some Circumstances too probable Account of  Barnwell  's Defection  Lucy  I am sorry Sir that my frank Confession of my former unhappy Course of Life shou'd cause you to suspect my Truth on this Occasion  Thor  It is not that your Confession has in it all the Appearance of Truth    To them    Among many other Particulars she informs me that  Barnwell  has been influenc'd to break his Trust and wrong me at several Times of considerable Sums of Money now as I know this to be false I wou'd fain doubt the whole of her Relationtoo dreadfulto be willingly believ'd  Ma  Sir your Pardon I find my self on a sudden so indispos'd that I must retireProvidence

Person informs me that your Friend at the Instigation of an impious Woman is gone to rob and murder his venerable Uncle  Tr  O execrable Deed I am blasted with the Horror of the Thought  Lucy  This Delay may ruin all  Thor  What to do or think I know not that he ever wrong'd me I know is falsethe rest may be so too there's all my Hope  Tr  Trust not to that rather suppose all true than lose a Moment's Time even now the horrid Deed may be a doingdreadful Imaginationor it may be done and we are vainly debating on the Means to prevent what is already past  Thor  This Earnestness convinces me that he knows more than he has yet discover'd What ho without there who waits  SCENE V    To them    A Servant  Thor  Order the Groom to saddle the swiftest Horse and prepare himself to set out with

your farther AssistanceReturn and observe this  Millwood  till I come I have your Directions and will follow you as soon as possible  SCENE VII  Thorowgood  and  Trueman  Thor  Trueman  you I am sure wou'd not be idle on this Occasion  SCENE VIII  Trueman  He only who is a Friend can judge of my Distress  SCENE IX  Millwood  's House  Millwood  I wish I knew the Event of his Designthe Attempt without Success would ruin himWell what have I to apprehend from that I fear too much The Mischief being only intended his Friends in pity of his Youth turn all their Rage on me I should have thought of that beforeSuppose the Deed done then and then only I shall be secure or what if he returns without attempting it at all  SCENE X  Millwood  and  Barnwell  bloody    Mill  But he is here and I have done him wrong his bloody Hands show he has done the Deed but show he wants the Prudence to conceal it  Barn  Where shall I hide me whether shall I fly to avoid the swift unerring Hand of Justice  Mill  Dismiss those Fears tho' Thousands had pursu'd you to the Door yet being enter'd here you are safe as Innocence I have such a Cavern by Art so cunningly contriv'd that the piercing Eyes of Jealousy and Revenge may search in vain nor find the Entrance to the safe Retreat there will I hide you if any Danger's near  Barn  O hide me from my self if it be possible for while I bear my Conscience in my Bosom tho' I were hid where Man's Eye never saw nor Light e'er dawn'd 'twere all in vain For that inmatethat impartial Judge will try convict and sentence me for Murder and execute me with never ending Torments Behold these Hands all crimson'd o'er with my dear Uncle's Blood Here's a Sight to make a Statue start with Horror or turn a living Man into a Statue  Mill  Ridiculous Then it seems you are afraid of your own Shadow or what's less than a Shadow your Conscience  Barn  Tho' to Man unknown I did the accursed Act what can we hide from Heav'ns omniscient Eye  Mill  No more of this Stuffwhat advantage have you made of his Death or what advantage may yet be made of itdid you secure the Keys of his Treasurethose no doubt were  about himwhat Gold what Jewels or what else of Value have you brought me  Barn  Think you I added Sacrilege to Murder Oh had you seen him as his Life flowed from him in a Crimson Flood and heard him praying for me by the double Name of Nephew and of Murderer alas alas he knew not then that his Nephew was his Murderer how wou'd you have wish'd as I did tho' you had a thousand Years of Life to come to have given them all to have lengthen'd his one Hour But being dead I fled the Sight of what my Hands had done nor cou'd I to have gain'd the Empire of the World have violated by Theft his sacred Corps  Mill  Whining preposterous canting Villain to murder your Uncle rob him of Life Natures first last dear Prerogative after which there's no Injury then fear to take what he no longer wanted and bring to me your Penury and Guilt Do you think I'll hazard my Reputation nay my Life to entertain you  Barn  Oh  Millwood  this from theebut I have doneif you hate me if you wish me dead then are you happyfor Oh 'tis sure my Grief will quickly end me  Mill  In his Madness he will discover all and involve me in his Ruinwe are on a Precipice from whence there's no Retreat for boththen to preserve my self    Pauses    There is no other Way'tis dreadfulbut Reflection comes too late when Danger's pressingand there's no room for ChoiceIt must be done    Stamps  SCENE XI    To them    A Servant  Mill  Fetch me an Officer and seize this Villain he has confess'd himself a Murderer shou'd I let him escape I justly might be thought as bad as he  SCENE XII  Millwood  and  Barnwell  Barn  O  Millwood  sure thou dost not cannot mean it Stop the Messenger upon my Knees I beg you call him back 'Tis fit I die indeed but not by you I will this Instant deliver my self into the Hands of Justice indeed I will for Death is all I wish But thy Ingratitude so tears my wounded Soul 'tis worse ten thousand times than Death with Torture  Mill  Call it what you will I am willing to live and live secure which nothing but your Death can warrant  Barn  If there be a Pitch of Wickedness that seats the Author beyond the reach of Vengeance you must be secure But what remains for me but a dismal Dungeon hardgalling Fetters an awful Tryal and ignominious Death justly to fall unpitied and abhorr'dAfter Death to be suspended between Heaven and Earth a dreadful Spectacle the warning and horror of a gaping Croud This I cou'd bear nay wish not to avoid had it but come from any Hand but thine  SCENE XIII  Millwood Barnwell Blunt  Officer and Attendants    Mill  Heaven defend me Conceal a Murderer here Sir take this Youth into your Custody I accuse  him of Murder and will appear to make good my Charge    They seize him  Barn  To whom of what or how shall I complain I'll not accuse her the Hand of Heav'n is in it and this the Punishment of Lust and Parricide yet Heav'n that justly cuts me off still suffers her to live perhaps to punish others tremendous Mercy so Fiends are curs'd with Immortality to be the Executioners of Heaven  Be warn'd ye Youths who see my sad Despair  Avoid lewd Women False as they are Fair  By Reason guided honest Joys pursue  The Fair to Honour and to Virtue true  Just to her self will ne'er be false to you  By my Example learn to shun my Fate  How wretched is the Man who's wise too late  E'er Innocence and Fame and Life be lost  Here purchase Wisdom cheaply at my Cost  SCENE XIV  Millwood  and  Blunt  Mill  Where's  Lucy  why is she absent at such a Time  Blunt  Wou'd I had been so too thou Devil  Mill  Insolent this to me  Blunt  The worst that we know of the Devil is that he first seduces to Sin and then betrays to Punishment  SCENE XV  Millwood  They disapprove of my Conductand mean to take this Opportunity to set up for themselvesMy Ruin is resolv'dI see my Danger  but scorn both it and themI was not born to fall by such weak Instruments    Going  SCENE XVI  Thorowgood  and  Millwood  Thor  Where is this Scandal of her own Sex and Curse of ours  Mill  What means this Insolence Who do you seek  Thor  Millwood  Mill  Well you have found her thenI am  Millwood    Thor  Then you are the most impious Wretch that e'er the Sun beheld  Mill  From your Appearance I shou'd have expected Wisdom and Moderation but your Manners bely your AspectWhat is your Business here I know you not  Thor  Hereafter you may know me better I am  Barnwell  's Master  Mill  Then you are Master to a Villain which I think is not much to your Credit  Thor  Had he been as much above thy Arts as my Credit is superior to thy Malice I need not blush to own him  Mill  My ArtsI don't understand you Sir If he has done amiss what's that to me Was he my Servant or yoursYou shou'd have taught him better  Thor  Why shou'd I wonder to find such uncommon Impudence in one arriv'd to such a Height of WickednessWhen Innocence is banish'd Modesty soon follows Know Sorceress I'm not ignorant of any of your Arts by which you first deceiv'd the unwary Youth I know how Step by Step you've led him on reluctant and unwilling from Crime to Crime to this last horrid Act which  you contriv'd and by your curs'd Wiles even forced him to commit and then betray'd him  Mill  Ha  Lucy  has got the Advantage of me and accused me first unless I can turn the Accusation and fix it upon her and  Blunt  I am lost    Aside  Thor  Had I known your cruel Design sooner it had been prevented To see you punish'd as the Law directs is all that now remainsPoor Satisfactionfor he innocent as he is compared to you must suffer too But Heaven who knows our Frame and graciously distinguishes between Frailty and Presumption will make a Difference tho' Man cannot who sees not the Heart but only judges by the outward Action  Mill  I find Sir we are both unhappy in our Servants I was surpriz'd at such ill Treatment from a Gentleman of your Appearance without Cause and therefore too hastily return'd it for which I ask your Pardon I now perceive you have been so far impos'd on as to think me engaged in a former Correspondence with your Servant and some Way or other accessary to his Undoing  Thor  I charge you as the Cause the sole Cause of all his Guilt and all his Suffering of all he now endures and must endure till a violent and shameful Death shall put a dreadful Period to his Life and Miseries together  Mill  'Tis very strange but who's secure from Scandal and DetractionSo far from contributing to his Ruin I never spoke to him till since that fatal Accident which I lament as much as you 'Tis true I have a Servant on whose Account he has of late frequented my House if she has abus'd my good Opinion of her am I to blame Has n't  Barnwell  done the same by you  Thor  I hear you pray go on  Mill  I have been inform'd he had a violent Passion for her and she for him but I always thought it innocent I know her poor and given to expensive  Pleasures Now who can tell but she may have influenced the amorous Youth to commit this Murder to supply her Extravagancies it must be soI now recollect a thousand Circumstances that confirm it I'll have her and a Man Servant that I suspect as an Accomplice secured immediately I hope Sir you will lay aside your illgrounded Suspicions of me and join to punish the real Contrivers of this bloody Deed    Offers to go  Thor  Madam you pass not this Way I see your Design but shall protect them from your Malice  Mill  I hope you will not use your Influence and the Credit of your Name to skreen such guilty Wretches Consider Sir the Wickedness of perswading a thoughtless Youth to such a Crime  Thor  I doand of betraying him when it was done  Mill  That which you call betraying him may convince you of my Innocence She who loves him tho' she contriv'd the Murder would never have deliver'd him into the Hands of Justice as I struck with the Horror of his Crimes have done  Thor  How shou'd an unexperienc'd Youth escape her Snares the powerful Magick of her Wit and Form might betray the wisest to simple Dotage and fire the Blood that Age had froze long since Even I that with just Prejudice came prepared had by her artful Story been deceiv'd but that my strong Conviction of her Guilt makes even a Doubt impossible Those whom subtilly you wou'd accuse you know are your Accusers and what proves unanswerably their Innocence and your Guilt they accus'd you before the Deed was done and did all that was in their Power to have prevented it  Mill  Sir you are very hard to be convinc'd but I have such a Proof which when produced will silence all Objections  SCENE XVII  Thorowgood Lucy Trueman Blunt Officers  c  Lucy  Gentlemen pray place your selves some on one Side of that Door and some on the other watch her Entrance and act as your Prudence shall direct youThis Way    to  Thorowgood  and note her Behaviour I have observ'd her she's driven to the last Extremity and is forming some desperate ResolutionI guess at her Design  SCENE XVIII  To them  Millwood  with a Pistol  Trueman  secures her    Tr  Here thy Power of doing Mischief ends deceitful cruel bloody Woman  Mill  Fool Hypocrite VillainMan thou can'st not call me that  Tr  To call thee Woman were to wrong the Sex thou Devil  Mill  That imaginary Being is an Emblem of thy cursed Sex collected A Mirrour wherein each particular Man may see his own Likeness and that of all Mankind  Tr  Think not by aggravating the Fault of others to extenuate thy own of which the Abuse of such uncommon Perfections of Mind and Body is not the least  Mill  If such I had well may I curse your barbarous Sex who robb'd me of 'em e'er I knew their Worth then left me too late to count their Value by their Loss Another and another Spoiler came and all my Gain was Poverty and Reproach My Soul disdain'd and yet disdains Dependance and Contempt Riches no Matter by what Means  obtain'd I saw secur'd the worst of Men from both I found it therefore necessary to be rich and to that End I summon'd all my Arts You call 'em wicked be it so they were such as my Conversation with your Sex had furnish'd me withal  Thor  Sure none but the worst of Men convers'd with thee  Mill  Men of all Degrees and all Professions I have known yet found no Difference but in their several Capacities all were alike wicked to the utmost of their Power In Pride Contention Avarice Cruelty and Revenge the Reverend Priesthood were my unering Guides From SuburbMagistrates who live by ruin'd Reputations as the unhospitable Natives of  Cornwall  do by Shipwrecks I learn'd that to charge my innocent Neighbours with my Crimes was to merit their Protection for to skreen the Guilty is the less scandalous when many are suspected and Detraction like Darkness and Death blackens all Objects and levels all Distinction Such are your venal Magistrates who favour none but such as by their Office they are sworn to punish With them not to be guilty is the worst of Crimes and large Fees privately paid is every needful Virtue  Thor  Your Practice has sufficiently discover'd your Contempt of Laws both human and divine no wonder then that you shou'd hate the Officers of both  Mill  I hate you all I know you and expect no Mercy nay I ask for none I have done nothing that I am sorry for I follow'd my Inclinations and that the best of you does every Day All Actions are alike natural and indifferent to Man and Beast who devour or are devour'd as they meet with others weaker or stronger than themselves  Thor  What Pity it is a Mind so comprehensive daring and inquisitive shou'd be a Stranger to Religion's sweet but powerful Charms  Mill  I am not Fool enough to be an Atheist tho' I have known enough of Mens Hypocrisy to make a thousand simple Women so Whatever Religion is in it self as practis'd by Mankind it has caus'd the Evils you say it was design'd to cure War Plague and Famine has not destroy'd so many of the human Race as this pretended Piety has done and with such barbarous Cruelty as if the only Way to honour Heaven were to turn the present World into Hell  Thor  Truth is Truth tho' from an Enemy and spoke in Malice You bloody blind and superstitious Bigots how will you answer this  Mill  What are your Laws of which you make your Boast but the Fool's Wisdom and the Coward's Valour the Instrument and Skreen of all your Villanies by which you punish in others what you act your selves or wou'd have acted had you been in their Circumstances The Judge who condemns the poor Man for being a Thief had been a Thief himself had he been poor Thus you go on deceiving and being deceiv'd harrassing plaguing and destroying one another but Women are your universal Prey  Women by whom you are the Source of Joy  With cruel Arts you labour to destroy  A thousand Ways our Ruin you pursue  Yet blame in us those Arts first taught by you  O may from hence each violated Maid  By flatt'ring faithless barb'rous Man betray'd  When robb'd of Innocence and Virgin Fame  From your Destruction raise a nobler Name  To right their Sex's Wrongs devote their Mind  And future  Millwoods  prove to plague Mankind  The End of the Fourth Act  ACT V  SCENE I  A Room in a Prison  Thorowgood Blunt  and  Lucy  Thor  I Have recommended to  Barnwell  a Reverend Divine whose Judgment and Integrity I am well acquainted with nor has  Millwood  been neglected but she unhappy Woman still obstinate refuses his Assistance  Lucy  This pious Charity to the Afflicted well becomes your Character yet pardon me Sir if I wonder you were not at their Trial  Thor  I knew it was impossible to save him and I and my Family bear so great a Part in his Distress that to have been present wou'd have aggravated our Sorrows without relieving his  Blunt  It was mournful indeed  Barnwell  's Youth and modest Deportment as he past drew Tears from every Eye When placed at the Bar and arraigned before the Reverend Judges with many Tears and interrupting Sobs he confess'd and aggravated his Offences without accusing or once reflecting on  Millwood  the shameless Author of his Ruin who dauntless and unconcern'd stood by his Side viewing with visible Pride and Contempt the vast Assembly who all with sympathizing Sorrow wept for the wretched Youth  Millwood  when called upon to answer loudly insisted upon her Innocence and made an artful and a bold Defence but finding all in vain the impartial Jury and the learned Bench concurring to find her guilty how did she curse her self poor  Barnwell  us her Judges all  Mankind but what cou'd that avail she was condemn'd and is this Day to suffer with him  Thor  The Time draws on I am going to visit  Barnwell  as you are  Millwood    Lucy  We have not wrong'd her yet I dread this Interview She's proud impatient wrathful and unforgiving To be the branded Instruments of Vengeance to suffer in her Shame and sympathize with her in all she suffers is the Tribute we must pay for our former ill spent Lives and long confederacy with her in Wickedness  Thor  Happy for you it ended when it did What you have done against  Millwood  I know proceeded from a just Abhorrence of her Crimes free from Interest Malice or Revenge Proselytes to Virtue shou'd be encourag'd Pursue your proposed Reformation and know me hereafter for your Friend  Lucy  This is a Blessing as unhop'd for as unmerited but Heaven that snatched us from impending Ruin sure intends you as its Instrument to secure us from Apostacy  Thor  With Gratitude to impute your Deliverance to Heaven is just Many less virtuously dispos'd than  Barnwell  was have never fallen in the Manner he has donemay not such owe their Safety rather to Providence than to themselves With Pity and Compassion let us judge him Great were his Faults but strong was the Temptation Let his Ruin learn us Diffidence Humanity and Circumspectionfor wewho wonder at his Fateperhaps had we like him been tryedlike him we had fallen too  SCENE II  A Dungeon a Table and Lamp  Thorowgood Barnwell  reading    Thor  See there the bitter Fruits of Passion's detested Reign

Disrespectindeed I saw you not  Thor  'Tis well I hope you were better imploy'd in viewing of your selfyour Journey's long your Time for preparation almost spentI sent a Reverend Divine to teach you to improve it and shou'd be glad to hear of his Success  Barn  The Word of Truth which he recommended for my constant Companion in this my sad Retirement has at length remov'd the Doubts I labour'd under From thence I've learn'd the infinite Extent of heavenly Mercy that my Offences tho' great are not unpardonable and that 'tis not my Interest only but my Duty to believe and to rejoice in that HopeSo shall Heaven receive the Glory and future Penitents the Profit of my Example  Thor  Go onHow happy am I who live to see this  Barn  'Tis wonderfulthat Words shou'd charm Despair speak Peace and

feel my Grief increase even as my Fears  give wayJoy and Gratitude now supply more Tears than the Horror and Anguish of Despair before  Thor  These are the genuine Signs of true Repentance the only Preparatory certain Way to everlasting PeaceO the Joy it gives to see a Soul form'd and prepar'd for HeavenFor this the faithful Minister devotes himself to Meditation Abstinence and Prayer shuning the vain Delights of sensual Joys and daily dies that others may live for everFor this he turns the sacred Volumes o'er and spends his Life in painful Search of TruthThe Love of Riches and the Lust of Power he looks on with just Contempt and Detestation who only counts for Wealth the Souls he wins and whose highest Ambition is to serve MankindIf the Reward of all his Pains be to preserve one Soul from wandering or turn one from the Error of his Ways how does he then rejoice and own his little Labours over paid  Barn  What do I owe for all your generous Kindness but tho' I cannot Heaven can and will reward you  Thor  To see thee thus is Joy too great for Words FarewellHeaven strengthen theeFarewell  Barn  O Sir there's something I cou'd say if my sad swelling Heart would give me leave  Thor

Benefit impart  Never to know my Guiltnor feel my Pain  Then must you own you ought not to complain  Since you nor weepnor shall I die in vain  SCENE XI  Trueman Blunt  and  Lucy  Lucy  Heartbreaking SightO wretched wretched  Millwood    Tr  You came from her thenHow is she disposed to meet her Fate  Blunt  Who can describe unalterable Woe  Lucy  She goes to Death encompassed with Horror loathing Life and yet afraid to die no Tongue can tell her Anguish and Despair  Tr  Heaven be better to her than her Fears may she prove a Warning to others a Monument of Mercy in her self  Lucy  O Sorrow insupportable break break my Heart  Tr  In vain  With bleeding Hearts and weeping Eyes we show  A human gen'rous Sense of others Woe  Unless we mark what drew their Ruin on  And by avoiding that prevent our own  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Written by COLLEY CIBBER  Esq  and spoke by Mrs CIBBER  SINCE Fate has robb'd me of the hapless Youth  For whom my Heart had hoarded up its Truth  By all the Laws of Love and Honour now  I'm free again to chuseand one of you  But softWith Caution first I'll round me peep  Maids in my Case shou'd look before they leap  Here's Choice enough of various Sorts and Hue  The Cit the Wit the Rake cock'd up in Cue  The fair spruce Mercer and the tawney Jew  Suppose I search the sober GalleryNo  There's none but Prenticesand Cuckolds all a Row  And these I doubt are those that make 'em so    Pointing to the Boxes  'Tis very well enjoy the JestBut you  Fine powder'd Sparksnay I'm told 'tis true  Your happy Spousescan make Cuckolds too  'Twixt you and them the Diff'rence this perhaps  The Cit's asham'd whene'er his Duck he traps  But you when Madam's tripping let her fall  Cock up your Hats and take no Shame at all  What if some favour'd Poet I cou'd meet  Whose Love wou'd lay his Lawrels at my Feet  NoPainted Passion real Love abhors  His Flame wou'd prove the Suit of Creditors  Not to detain you then with longer Pause  In short my Heart to this Conclusion draws  A yield it to the Hand that's loudest in Applause
