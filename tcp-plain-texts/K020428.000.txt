 SHORT SKETCH OF TEMPORARY REGULATIONS UNTIL BETTER SHALL BE PROPOSED FOR THE INTENDED SETTLEMENT ON THE GRAIN COAST OF AFRICA NEAR  SIERRA LEONA  LONDON  PRINTED BY H BALDWIN FLEETSTREET M DCC LXXXVI  A SHORT SKETCH OF TEMPORARY REGULATIONS  c  FRANKPLEDGE  THE most certain and effectual mode of securing peace right and mutual protection for any community is the old English system of mutual  Frankpledge  or  free suretyship  given by all  the house∣holders  for themselves and each other in exact numerical divisions of  tens  and hundreds which in the English law∣books is called  "Maxima securitas"    "the greatest security"  though it is now unhappily neglected and consequently crimes abound and increase so that  notwithstanding the horrible increase also of  bloody laws  to intimidate offenders yet there is  no effectual security  from vio∣lence and robbery either in our streets or roads or even in our chambers since the houses of the rich and great nay of the first officers of the state are not ex∣empted from the nocturnal intrusion of housebreakers insomuch that even the Lord Chancellor and Honourable Speaker of the House of Commons have lately experienced the common danger and the deplorable want of the antient  "Maxima securitas"  That funda∣mental system of  English polity  is so little known among us at present that many wellmeaning persons are induced by their fears to wish for  security  on a much less eligible plan formed on the model of the arbitrary system of govern∣ment in France commonly called  police  the introduction of which would be an utter perversion of the first principles of  legal  government in England The inha∣bitants even of the most distant settle∣ments under the crown of GreatBritain must not adopt any  polity  that is essen∣tially  inconsistent  with the  Maxima secu∣ritas  ordained and required by the common law of England  The community of free African set∣tlers however have already adopted as I am informed a small variation from the old English model of numerical di∣visions by forming themselves into di∣visions of  dozens  instead of  tithings  or  tens  but as this little change is by no means  inconsistent  with the true princi∣ples and intention of our legal English  frankpledge  I am at liberty to acknow∣ledge a most hearty approbation of it as being an arrangement far more con∣venient and effectual for securing perfect subordination peace and good govern∣ment even than the antient legal divi∣sions  into  tens  or  decenaries  because each  dozen  will have one  chief  or  headborough  and one  assistant headborough  to govern and lead a compleat complement of ten  deciners  so that the division may still with propriety retain the old  legal  name of a  tithing  or  decenary  and the  hundred division  may be rendered literally and strictly an  hundred  families by appoint∣ing one  hundreder  two  chiefs  of  fifties  and one town clerk or clerk of the hundred over every  eight dozens  whereby the legal  hundred  in its civil capacity for the maintenance of  peace justice  and  common right  according to the first principles of our constitutional  polity  the most effectual for all the purposes of good government will consist of    Hundreder  or centurion  Who in the common law is a  high constable  and  "justiciarius"  or justice of the peace      Chiefs  of  fiftiessuperior constables  and presiding  justices  in the weekly Tithingcourts  † Or rather in the courts or four tithings or dozens collected together      Townclerk  or Clerk of the hun∣dred  With a proper salary to register all judgments and debts and to be allowed two or more assistants if necessary from the best qualified of the deciners with suitable salaries also for their trouble      Headboroughs  being constables in ordinary    assistant Headboroughs  or consta∣bles extraordinary    Deciners  masters of families or householders  Who jointly with the chiefs of their several divi∣sions pledge each other and their respective families or dependants for the publick peace and common right and are termed in law  boni et legales homines "Good and true men"  viz    Householders  in all who must  equally  contribute to support all the burthens of the state and of course must be entitled to an  equal  voice in the  "common council"  or parliament of their settlement which on the African coast is called  Palaaver  and if the whole body of householders should hereafter by God's blessing become too numerous for a  personal  attendance in their  common council  they will be all equally entitled to elect a proper number of deputies from their respective divisions to represent them in the supreme council and that in a due and  equal  proportion to their numbers for otherwise their representa∣tion would be rendered most banefully  delusive  and  corrupt  And in a military capacity the same hundred house∣holders will form a corps of  militia  consisting of  Captain  Lieutenants  Muster master and commissary  Serjeants  Corporals    Milites  or men of arms  Amounting altogether to free militia men or armed de∣ciners  To these must also be added the sons apprentices and in∣dentured servants of the deci∣ners viz all the males of years of age and upwards who by the  common law  are required to be armed and of course to be disciplined in the use of arms The average of males above years of age may be stated I believe at three to each family includ∣ing all the persons above de∣scribed so that in a few years if the settlement suc∣ceeds there may probably be added to the armed de∣ciners at least Privates or rank and file  In all militia men in each hundred division a corps that may be rendered sufficiently effectual to support the executive justice of a free legal government within any extent of  land which an  hundred families  can fairly occupy and amply sufficient to supply a roster or rotation of very easy service in the necessary  watch  and  ward  of the settlement  N B This average number of males would be rather too large were not ap∣prentices and  indentured servants  in∣cluded but in a new settlement where  ordinary labour  is chiefly wanted there is a great probability that the  indentured servants  will far exceed the number I have estimated  WATCH AND WARD  RotationExerciseDiscipline preserved by Fines of LabourWatch Duty of Indentured Servants to be allowed and deducted from the Term of their Indentures  THE  hundred deciners  should serve three at a time at least with six privates in due rotation as the nightly guard of the  hundred division  which guard being divided into three parties of one deciner and two privates each one party may patrole whilst the other two are sta∣tioned at the gatehouse or watch∣tower alternately watching and resting every four hours but the patroling and watching party must relieve each other every two hours until it is their turn to rest four hours in the inner guard room by this means the watch duty may be  rendered very easy and  equal  to all ranks of persons in the hundred and even if the captain and four of the  oldest  de∣ciners together with eight of the  youngest  privates be excused the nightly duty the rotation of this easy service to each individual will be only once in thirtytwo nights viz less than twelve nights in a year which cannot interfere with their ordinary employments but for the sake of keeping up proper disci∣pline triple the number ought to assem∣ble in rotation every evening and morn∣ing to set and to discharge the guard after the performance of a short military exercise all together under the inspec∣tion of the captain or one of the lieute∣nants being previously trained or drilled in small squads under the inspection of their respective serjeants and this at∣tendance may be rendered perfectly  equal  and regular to all ranks by a proper roster of service duly distinguishing the  courses of  Watch and Ward  from the rotation of attendance for mere exer∣cise  Want of punctuality in musters or absence should be punished in propor∣tion to the time lost by  equal  fines on all ranks of men estimated at so many  days  or  hours labour  as hereafter ex∣plained towards the support of the public Exchequer  Disobedience of orders on service and inattention or carelessness in exercise and all such other misdemeanors should be likewise punished by  fines of labour  for publick profit  The watch duty of an indentured ser∣vant should be rewarded by a deduction of one day's service from  his indentures  for each night that he attends on mili∣tary  duty which will encourage his vigilance and win his attention to the interests of the settlement and by his being entered on the same roster with the whole body of  deciners  and by serv∣ing in due rotation with them he will soon perceive the facility and happiness of becoming a  deciner  himself by proper diligence in fulfilling his contract of la∣bour especially as the regulations here∣after to be mentioned will insure him from the imposition of more service than is due and from the fraud or oppression of an unjust master and he will acquire still further security by being known and by becoming acquainted with other deciners besides his master in the mi∣litia service  FREE LABOUR  Free Labour to be the Standard or Medium of Traffick instead of CashTimes of Labour publick or hired to be general and uniform Evening Prayer and the Advantages of it Limitation of Labour per Day to eight HoursSix Hours on SaturdaysThat the People may attend the Courts and Folkmotes to improve their Decernment of Good and Evil  HUMAN Labour  is more essential and valuable than any other article in new settlements which chiefly depend on the cultivation and produce of the earth for their subsistence and commer∣cial profit On this account though the price of provisions is generally lower in new settlements than in communi∣ties of long standing yet the price of  Free Labour  is always much higher and higher still or rather infinitely  more  expensive  however slaveholders may reckon is  the labour of slaves  besides the abominable injustice the corruption of manners the danger and other  curses  which  always attend  the tolera∣tion of slavery  Free labour  therefore in all new settlements ought to be made the  standard  or  medium  whereby to rate the value of all the necessaries of life as well as of all articles of com∣merce in the settlement a cow sheep or hog or a bushel of corn should each be valued at a proportionable number of  day's labour  estimated at eight hours actual labour per day and a pig rabbit or fowl at so many  hours labour  ac∣cording to their respective sizes and for the fractional estimation of smaller arti∣cles the hours may be reduced to  minutes  and thereby afford an excellent substitute for money as a medium of traffic and exchange whereon a  paper currency  may be established which will  always bear an  intrinsic value  without diminution as hereafter explained under the head of  Publick Revenue  The daily commencement of publick labour and of hired labour and all the necessary cessations from labour for rest and refreshment should be limited to stated periods of time rendered uniform and general throughout the settlement by the periodical summons of a publick bell as in our  dock yards  and great ma∣nufactories for the more effectual pre∣vention of imposition by the employer or employed  By the limitation of labour to eight hours per day the rateable or legal days work instead of continuing from six in the morning to six in the evening as with us will end at four in the after∣noon including two whole hours for necessary refreshment and rest unless it  should be thought more convenient in general to begin at five in the morning and to work three hours till eight and then after resting half an hour at break∣fast to work three hours and an half more till noon when a moderate and temperate meal suitable to the heat of the climate may be rendered more re∣freshing and healthful to the labourer by a  general sestoo  or sleeping time during the meridean heat till half past one which rest of one hour and an half at one time will be amply sufficient to recruit them for the remaining burthen of the rateable labour or legal day's work viz one hour and an half more ending at three o'clock in the afternoon when the  evening  of the antients com∣menced and the appointed hour of  even∣ing sacrifice  in the patriarchal times If therefore the new society would agree to assemble at  that hour  in whatever place they shall afterwards appropriate  to religious worship and there join toge∣ther in a very short  general form of prayer and evening sacrifice of thanks  in which to remove all objections about the value of time they need not be detained much longer than about five minutes to ex∣press all that may be absolutely neces∣sary for every good purpose of prayer and thanksgiving at least as a  daily  ser∣vice they will soon be convinced that no human measure is so well calculated to add real dignity to the ordinary la∣bourer as well with respect to his own  internal  improvement as in the out∣ward esteem and consideration which it will necessarily insure to him from others by continually reminding the rich and higher ranks of men that the daily la∣bourer is their brother and their  equal  in the sight of God and that all men ought to be  equally  servants to  the same Lord  I could wish that a short daily morning prayer might also be adopted at  nine o'clock after breakfast but I pro∣pose with diffidence lest publick prayers even  only once  a day should be obtained with difficulty  As some of the  out lots  will be distant about two miles from the centre of the township it may perhaps be more expe∣dient to commence the rateable daily labour even half an hour sooner still than I have last proposed viz at half past four in the cool of the morning where∣by all  publick labour  will end at half past two in the afternoon which will allow time for labourers in the distant lots to repair to the general assembly of the township at  evening prayer  And an officer from every dozen may be ordered to be prepared by a previous examina∣tion at the publick bank of all the in∣dents in course for each day's labour that after being discharged in the pub∣lick books they may be cancelled and  most expeditiously returned to those who have fulfilled them all which by the happy system of  Frankpledge  may be most easily effected with very little loss of time so that the labourers may return from the centre of the township to their own private lots and have near five hours of leisure to themselves to cul∣tivate their own land even if they work no later than eight at night which will allow them ample time for rest espe∣cially as the midday  sestoo  will render less sleep necessary at night  A seventh part of the year shall be appropriated more particularly to God's service and shall be duly observed and kept holy on the pe∣nalty of seven weeks or fortytwo days labour in the publick lots for every breach of this universal law of God either in buying selling or  working for pecuniary profit  or for  travelling  unless a very urgent necessity can be proved and this penalty to be doubled on a repeti∣tion or continuance of the offence Sundays or days of our Lord  Two more days shall be appro∣priated to a religious commemora∣tion of our Lord's birth and expia∣tory death at the usual seasons and a third day to the great annual  view of Frankpledge  to be ap∣pointed at some convenient season after the greatest and most general harvest of the year the remem∣brance of which shall also be so∣lemnized on that day by religious thanksgiving both at the opening and conclusion of the  view of Frankpledge  so that the days of the year will be further reduced by the deduction also of Holidays  The abovementioned Sundays and holidays amounting to fifty∣five days being deducted from the year there will remain only Days of labour    The days of labour shall be rated throughout the new settlement only at  eight hours actual labour each day in all agreements or contracts for labour as well of apprentices and indentured servants as of those who are hired by the day that all labourers may have some leisure hours every day to culti∣vate their own private lots of land And only six hours labour are to be re∣quired by law on Saturdays without any deduction from the labourer's profit for the deficiency because it is for the pub∣lick benefit that the people should have leisure to attend the courts and folkmotes to be held on Saturdays in order that they may gradually improve that natural faculty of  reason  or  knowledge  which is inherited by all men from our first pa∣rents and may  "have their understand∣ings exercised by habit to discern both good and evil"  FREEDOM AND PROTECTION TO STRANGERS  Limitation of Indentured ServiceAn injured Indentured Servant to be turned over to the Publick ExchequerFugitive Slaves to be protected and allowed to purchase Land by Labour and after due Time of Probation to be admitted to the Rank of Deciners  AS soon as a slave shall set his foot within the bounds of the new settlement he shall be deemed a  free man  and be equally entitled with the rest of the in∣habitants to the protection of the laws and to all the natural rights of humanity And the service even of  indentured ser∣vants  shall be strictly limited viz no person to be bound for a longer term than five years after the age of twenty∣one or of seven years if bound after the age of fourteen years or of ten years if  bound after the age of eleven years And if any indentured servant shall have just cause to complain of his master's beha∣viour to him he shall be turned over to the care of the  general asylum for males  and his  labour  for the limited term of his indentures shall be turned over to the  publick Exchequer  which shall purchase of the master all the re∣maining term of service If any slave shall  escape from his master  in any part of the neighbouring country where the abominable traffic in human beings is tolerated and shall apply at any town∣ship within the free settlements for an asylum he shall be received and pro∣tected in the publick asylum for this is required by an indispensable moral law of God and of course by the laws of England  Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant  or  slave  for all  slaves  are servants  which is es∣caped  from his master unto thee he shall dwell with thee even among you in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates where it liketh him best Thou shalt not oppress him  Deut xxiii The stranger how∣ever shall be required to promise obe∣dience to the laws of the settlement and due legal submission to the chiefs of the division wherein he is admitted and pledged and also to enter himself on the publick roster of equal service in  Watch and Ward  when of proper age And in order to obtain his livelyhood independently of individuals he shall if he is above twenty years of age be al∣lowed to purchase of the publick Ex∣chequer one quarter of a lot of land for one year's service consisting of days service of eight hours each and a proportionable addition to the term if under that age for which quarter of a  lot he shall be taxed only one quarter part of a deciner's contribution to paro∣chial and publick exigences and expences which proportionable contribution of labour for  taxes  shall commence from the time he receives the land but the Exchequer shall give him credit for the  labour of purchase  until the second year after he receives the land in the course of which only  half of the labour  viz days may be demanded and the remainder in the course of the third year whereby the stranger will have  spare days of labour  to enable him by giving indents for it to purchase neces∣saries for his farm And he shall be al∣lowed a separate chamber in the publick asylum or inn until he is able to build an house or cottage upon his own lot After he has faithfully discharged his debt of service according to his first con∣tract with the Exchequer and also his  other contract debts with private indivi∣duals for all such private debts should be entered in the publick Exchequer in order to give  intrinsic value to the in∣dentures for labour  as the state of  every man's  credit and circumstances will then appear on the publick books he shall be allowed another quarter of a lot on the same terms and so on till he has acquired a compleat lot when if he has by his good and faithful behaviour proved himself worthy of the rank and trust of a  deciner  he shall be admitted to all the privileges and civil rights of the community as a free member and  equal proprietor  of the whole settlement  REDEMPTION FROM SLAVERY  Redemption from SlaveryPrice to be repaid by a short limited Service to the Publick Exche∣querProfit by Redemption infinitely superior to the Profits of the Slave Trade  THOUGH it is a fundamental prin∣ciple of the settlement that all  slaves  shall be deemed  free  as soon as they enter it so that no person can retain or sell or employ  a slave  within the bounds of the settlement yet there can be no impropriety in providing a means of re∣paying the expence of  redeeming slaves  on the condition of a  short limited service  as an apprentice or indentured servant provided that the actual prices given for redemption can be sufficiently authenti∣cated that no more may be repaid except perhaps a limited profit not exceeding ten per cent by way of in∣terest  for advancing the price and pro∣vided also that the said  limited service  of the contract be not claimable by any  individual  but by the  publick Exchequer only  after the redeemed person has con∣sented to work out the price whereby all possibility of  domestic slavery  or  pri∣vate oppression  will be excluded and the Exchequer will give an ample equi∣valent to the redeemed person to insure his voluntary consent to a contract for a  limited time of labour  not only by the protection it will afford him but also by putting him in possession of a portion of land equal to the quarter part of a  de∣ciner's  lot to be increased as he discharges his debt of labour and by finding him provisions until he shall be able to raise provisions from his own land The publick Exchequer will be enabled by the consent of a majority of the set∣tlers thus to dispose of land because all the  unoccupied  land in the settlement  is to be deemed as  common  in which the whole body of settlers sent out from England if above sixteen years of age whether indentured or not shall be en∣titled to an  equal share  and therefore no land must be appropriated but by  com∣mon  consent Suppose the redemption of a man should cost ten pounds which I believe is about the average price on the coast and suppose the labour of such a stranger be estimated only at sixpence ster∣ling per day though it is certainly worth much more perhaps three or four times as much a limited service by the re∣deemed person of five years to the pub∣lick Exchequer as an equivalent for the purchase of a full lot of protected land with a gradual introduction to all the privileges of a free English settlement will amount at working days per annum fiftytwo sundays and three holi∣days being deducted for the reasons al∣ready mentioned under the head  of Free  Labour  will amount I say to l s out of which after paying l the price of redemption and per cent for the advance of money viz l more there will remain in the publick Exchequer towards supplying food and necessaries to the labourer till he can provide for himself and for risque of loss by sick∣ness or death the sum of l s the surplus of which if the redeemed per∣son lives and does well becomes the  property of the publick  in which he  himself  enjoys an equal share of pro∣fit so that the  purchase of a slave  un∣der so equitable a regulation will be really and truly a  Redemption from Sla∣very  to a state of  freedom  and protection And if the  voluntary labour of a man  should really be worth three times what I have estimated as I really believe it is the profit for redemption for l dis∣bursed will amount to l s which is l per cent in favour of the  publick Exchequer Nay the profit may be fairly estimated at a much higher rate for if the  free labour  which the redeemed person pays for his lot of land be employed by the elected trustees of the Exchequer in the  publick lots  of land they may expect to receive at least the  or∣dinary production of land  for the labour bestowed upon it which even in our northern climate may be rated at a  triple amount  and much more may certainly be expected in the fertile and productive climate of Africa so that the  ordinary profit  may fairly be stated at l s for l disbursed which is at the rate of l per cent in favour of the  publick Exchequer  in which the redeemed person himself would have an  equal pro∣perty  with the rest of the community Let the advocates for slavery shew if they can that  involuntary servitude  is equally profitable The intolerable ex∣pence of all kinds of labour wherever  slavery is permitted when compared with the price of labour in  free  countries will sufficiently confute them But more shall be said of the great profits of  Free Labour  under the head of  Publick Re∣venue c  AGRARIAN LAW  Money for purchasing Land to be

HundredOne reserved Lot to make good DeficienciesAllowance of Land to Ap∣prentices and indentured ServantsSons of Settlers how to purchase LandIndentured Servants allowed to redeem the Terms of Ser∣vice and howAnd to purchase Land by Labour  THE money which has been paid into the hands of the trustees to procure land for the settlement shall be vested in such articles of merchandize as are deemed  most proper for presents to the petty chiefs or Cabosieurs on the African coast and shall be disposed of among them to the best advantage to engage their peaceable consent to admit the new settlers and to give up to them a suffi∣cient tract of uninhabited land border∣ing on the sea or on some navigable river or creek where fresh water also may be procured with every other natu∣ral accommodation suitable and necessary for a proper settlement But in treating for the land the Cabosieurs or chiefs shall be informed as a necessary part of the agreement that the land which they are requested to give up to the new set∣lers is intended to be dignified with the title and privileges of a  land of freedom  like England where no man can be a slave for as soon as a  slave  sets foot on English ground he immediately be∣comes free provided he conforms him∣self  to the laws of the state And there∣fore if any  slave who has escaped from his master  in the neighbouring coun∣try where slavery is allowed should fairly get within the boundary of the new settlement he is afterwards to be considered as  a free man  And no man must pursue him to take him away by force nor be offended with the new settlers for refusing to deliver him up because they are indispensably required by the laws of God and of England to  protect the slave that has escaped from his master  See this further explained un∣der the head of  freedom  This previous declaration is absolutely necessary to be made as one means of avoiding future dis∣putes with the neighbouring inhabitants And in order that as much land as possi∣ble may be procured for the new settle∣ment by the abovementioned presents the agent or agents for the settlers and  every individual among them shall be restrained from purchasing or making any agreement whatever for separate  pri∣vate  property in land on pain of forfeit∣ing all right to a share in the profits of the settlement until an agreement is made and concluded for the  whole com∣mon stock of land  and until the bounds of it are actually marked out and made known to the whole body of settlers An invoice shall be made of all the ar∣ticles for presents in which the money intended for the purchase of land was invested so that if any articles remain more than are necessary for the purpose they shall be deemed a part of the  com∣mon stock  and shall be registered ac∣cordingly The whole body of original settlers that go together from England above the age of sixteen years whether male or female apprentice or in∣dentured servant shall be  equally  entitled to  all the land  within the bounds of the  settlement subject however to the rules hereafter expressed for the appropriation of it from time to time when wanted and all unappropriated land shall be deemed  common  No land shall be ap∣propriated but by the free consent of a majority of the settlers after a full dis∣cussion of the reasons in the common council or folkmote  When the agentconductor shall have carefully viewed and considered the tract of country thus vested in the community of settlers he shall recommend to them a proper situation for the first encamp∣ment and principal township as nearly in the center of their territory as the necessary accommodations of a constant supply of fresh water and a navigable communication with the sea will permit and he shall lay before the community his reasons for the choice and if any other person or persons should propose  different situations of equal propriety the  elected  heads of dozens or a sufficient deputation from them must carefully examine all the proposed situations and after duely weighing the reasons assign∣ed for each proposal they shall make their report to the  common council  and the opinion of the majority shall decide the question for it is absolutely neces∣sary that the majority of the settlers should be well satisfied and contented with the situation of their principal township whether it be better or worse than was first proposed But in all other points they must be obedient to the advice of the agentconductor and fol∣low his directions in clearing the ground marking out and entrenching the first encampment building temporary bar∣racks and storehouses for the accom∣modation of the whole community and in digging sowing and planting in the publick grounds for the common sup∣port  of the whole body of settlers and no man shall separate himself to work for private emolument until a small portion of land for a  town lot  and a larger portion for an  out lot  agreeable to a plan annexed No shall be marked out and sufficiently cleared by  publick  labour for  every settler  nor until the said portions of land are equally and in∣differently appropriated to each person  by lot  to avoid disputes and shall be duly registered with the names of the re∣spective proprietors Whether or not the  separate private houses  should be built by joint and  publick  labour may be afterwards discussed and determined in the  common council  Land shall be re∣served in the township for such new set∣tlers as may afterwards arrive which may in the mean time be cultivatad for public benefit but it shall  not be appropriated  until it is really wanted for such addi∣tional settlers as may afterwards join  themselves to the community for no man ought to be the proprietor of more than  one town lot  with its proportional  out lot  according to the limitation hereafter mentioned And therefore if any additional land either of town lots or out lots or both should be acquired by mar∣riage or by inheritance or legacy or by any other lawful means the inheritor shall be allowed three years to dispose of them but in any other case if it should be found out that one individual possesses more than one town lot or more land in out lots than is declared in the fol∣lowing table such land and lots shall be forfeited to the community  EXCEPTION  N B  The agent or first conductor of the settlement is excepted in the above regulation because he is to be allowed every tenth lot that is laid out for private property on account of his extraordinary  care and trouble in agreeing for the land and for laying out the lots  Memorandum Mr Smeathman the agent and first proposer of the settlement having unfortunately caught a putrid fever of which he died July the gentlemen of the committee must now determine whether this exception ought to be made in favour of any other agent or whether this tenth lot ought not rather to be reserved for such publick purposes as the committee may hereafter think proper to direct As more money than what is allowed by government will probably be wanted the reserved  tenth lots  may enable the settlers to repay whatever money may be necessary for them to borrow for the first exigencies of their little community  And also such  publick officers  are to be excepted who hold  publick lots  hereafter men∣tioned in right of their respective offi∣ces as the chaplain clerk of the hun∣dred two assistant clerks of the hundred and the three beadles each of whom may be allowed to possess one separate lot in their  private  capacity besides their  official publick  lots  If any man should be dissatisfied with the situation of the first township and  can find eleven other deciners of the same opinion they may afterwards dis∣pose of their registered lots and agree with the  community  to whom all the  un∣occupied land  within the bounds of the settlement doth jointly and equally be∣long for sufficient land to form a pro∣portional township in some distant part as proposed in the general scheme of the settlement plate No according to the following limitation  LIMITATION OF LANDED POSSESSIONS  NO person shall possess in his or her own right more land exclusive of the Town lot where the person dwells than the number of acres expressed against the following descriptions of places viz  Within miles of the principal town not more than Acres  Within miles of the sea navi∣gable river creek or haven in any other part of the settlement not more than Acres  Within miles of Do not more than Acres  Within miles of Do not more than Acres  Whenever nine lots are laid out a tenth of equal size shall be laid out closely adjoining to them which shall be numbered and registered as the property of  the conductor  or for a  reserve to pay publick debts  the first conductor to whom the promise of  every tenth lot  was made having lately died the com∣mittee are at liberty to dispose of this  re∣served land  as they shall think most just and right and an account shall be kept of whatever odd number of lots are laid out at the same time  more  than the ten last appropriated and  less  than the amount of another nine that as other new lots are demanded the con∣ductor may have a tenth lot of equal size close adjoining to any of the last appropriated lots which he shall chuse but for every ten lots thus marked out for  private property  two lots of equal size shall be also marked out adjoining to them for  publick uses  to be registered  as such which under the care of an elected committee in every district controlled by the common council of the state shall be cultivated by  publick labour  hereafter more fully explained and the produce be appropriated to a  publick fund  for religious instruction schools poor hospitals salaries of pub∣lick officers and all such just and rea∣sonable expences besides as ought to be defrayed by a publick exchequer And also to every hundred lots  laid out for  PRIVATE  property ten additional publick lots  N B  The  publick lots  are  not  to be reckoned with those that are  tithed  in favour of the con∣ductor but only the lots which are laid up for  private property  shall be laid out  closely adjoining viz One lot for a  general asylum for poor males  under the care and direction of the  oldest  and most prudent deciners in  the hun∣dred  elected as a committee expressly for that trust  Secondly One lot for a  general asylum of poor females  under the care of the  elderly widows  or of such other pru∣dent matrons as shall be elected to the charge  Thirdly One lot for a  general asylum of poor families  of both sexes together that the branches of a family may not be separated through misfortunes or poverty but that each family may be allowed a distinct and separate habitation to them∣selves at the publick expence until they can be otherwise provided and more comfortably established under the care and patronage of the committee of elder deciners above mentioned Spare cham∣bers shall also be prepared to accommo∣date strangers and travellers as at an inn but separately in the said three lots according to their respective descriptions of  male female  or  family  Fourthly One lot for the support of an  hospital for the sick and hurt  divided into separate wards for males and fe∣males subject respectively to the visita∣tion and direction of the two separate trusts abovementioned  And Fifthly One  penitentiary lot  to be strongly fenced with palisades ditch and parapet having all the defences re∣versed or facing inwards for the secure confinement of all felonious offenders and to be divided into three distinct compartments two for the separation of the two sexes and a third for the mar∣ried persons of either sex that they may not be separated from their spouses or families in case they should desire to attend them And  Sixthly One lot to be registered as  glebe  land and to be reserved for the chaplain of the hundred whenever a  clergyman duly qualisied shall be elected by the majority of the  deciners  or  house∣holders  in the  hundred  but no layman during the vacancy may receive any profit from  the glebe  though he may of∣ficiate gratis as far as a layman may lawfully be allowed to interfere in the sacred office And no chaplain shall be inducted to a legal charge or cure of souls over more than  one hundred families of deciners  and  their dependants  at one time with due exception however to clergymen of episcopal authority in case God's blessing on the settlement should hereafter render the appointment of bishops necessary  Seventhly One lot half of which to be appropriated to the use of a  parish clerk  who shall also act as a  head beadle  in all assemblies of the hundred and the other half in equal parts to  two in∣ferior beadles  for his assistants who as  soon as they can be taught shall have an additional salary as  trumpeters  to summon the people to the courts of justice and to assemble the militia at the head quarters in case of publick danger  Eighthly One lot for a  town clerk  or  recorder of the hundred  who shall keep an exact register of all the appro∣priations of land in his division the ros∣ters of service both civil and military the judgements of the courts for  fines of labour  and the due registering of all private contracts for  labour  in which duty he shall be subject to the control and accompt of the publick Exchequer in the principal township  Ninthly One lot for two  assistant clerks of the hundred  to be elected from the body of deciners the most prudent and best qualified to acquire a general  knowledge of the principles and max∣ims of the  common law  as well as of the regulations of the settlement that they may be able to advise the head∣boroughs on all occasions And  Tenthly One publick lot reserved to make good the deficiencies of any of the rest or to be applied to any other  public use  that the Hundred Court shall think proper to direct And if any of these  publick lots  or any parts thereof remain uncultivated the directors of the nearest bank with the consent of the Hundred Court may cause the su∣perfluous land to be cleared and culti∣vated for the increase of the publick stock and revenue  Every  apprentice  or  indentured male  above the age of sixteen years that shall afterwards be introduced into the settle∣ment from Europe and every male bred  in the settlement as they arrive at that age shall be allowed by the publick as many acres of land to himself adjoin∣ing to the out lot of his parent or of his master as will amount to  an eighth part of a lot  in order that he may em∣ploy his leisure hours to his own profit and as soon as he is twentyone years of age he shall have an addition from the publick of oneeighth more amounting in all to  one quarter of a lot gratis  and the son of a settler when arrived at that age shall be allowed to  purchase  threefourths of a lot more to compleat his proportion for a deciner at the rate of  half a year's service  for each  fourth part  that is in all for days labour to the publick half of which to be demanded before the end of the second year and the remainder gradually before the end of the third year But with re∣spect to an indentured servant or appren∣tice if he shall be able even before he  is of age to purchase out his indentures either by the produce of his private por∣tion of land or by entering himself at the town bank for such a proportion of his extra hours or evening's labour as shall be deemed equal to his strength without injury to the labour due to his master but not exceeding two hours making ten hours labour in all per day the master must consent to the redemp∣tion and the late indentured person even though he is not of age shall be al∣lowed to  purchase  one quarter of a lot in whatever township he shall chuse for  one year's service  viz days labour paid by installments as above to the Exche∣quer of the township but on condition however that if he does not chuse to settle in the township of his late master he shall give up the land which he there held on being allowed  the value  of it by the Exchequer and that he shall  previously apply to the headborough or chief of the division wherein his desired lot is situated in order to obtain the assent of the inhabitants to his admission among them which being granted he shall make a publick declaration in open court of his sincere intention to comply with the laws of the settlement and to behave himself consistently with the ne∣cessary peace and good order of a civi∣lized society And after he has ap∣proved himself to the vicinage of his new settlement by good behaviour and by a faithful discharge of the stipulated service or price he shall be admitted if he is twentyone years of age or as soon as he attains that age to all the civil rights of the community provided that he solemnly  renews  the said declaration at the next publick court or folkmote of the district which he inhabits and he shall then be allowed to purchase at the publick Exchequer as much more land  as will amount to a compleat lot And every indentured  European  above the age of twentyone shall be allowed  gra∣tis  half a lot of land adjoining to his master's  out lot  and as soon as the li∣mited demand of labour due to his master shall be faithfully discharged either by service or by redemption he shall be allowed to  purchase  half a lot more for two years service with rea∣sonable credit or allowance of time to perform it in to  the Exchequer  or pub∣lick bank and shall be admitted to all the civil rights of a deciner as soon as the stipulated service is faithfully dis∣charged or sooner if the  Hundred Court  shall be satisfied

daily labour honourable or at least  creditable  by being  general  All contributions to the state and all publick fines except those laid on persons convicted of felony within the settlement which are to be worked out in the  penitentiary lots  before de∣scribed shall be levied in  day labour  estimated whatever a man's calling art or ability may be at the rate of eight hours work per day of an  ordinary la∣bourer  so that persons who have money or more valuable employments may compound or find a sufficient substitute accustomed to  ordinary labour  but the substitute must be a  free man  because no slave nor even an apprentice or in∣dentured servant if bound for a longer term than what is limited under the general head of freedom shall be per∣mitted to work within the bounds of the settlement lest any discredit should thereby be thrown on  honest labour  And for the same reason the fines of days work laid on persons convicted of fe∣lony within the settlement shall not be entered on the same books of the Ex∣chequer which contain the names of the rest of the community but shall be re∣gistered in a distinct book as a separate  branch of the revenue and shall be worked out in the penitentiary lots  All written contracts or indentures for labour publick or private shall be en∣tered in the books of the Publick Exche∣quer to which shall be made compleat indexes of reference that the state of every man's engagements may easily be known whereby no man will have it in his power to dispose of indentures for more labour than such a reasonable pro∣portion of his leisure as he may be sup∣posed capable of fulfilling and discharging in due time  A  truth part  of the days of labour shall be appropriated to the support of Religious instruc∣tion schools widows poor and other paro∣chial exigencies Days  And also another  tenth  for other  general  expences of the community or state Days  This publick contribution of  twotenths  or onefifth of the  workdays  in a year shall be equally required of all males above the age of eighteen years and shall be estimated at the value only of  ordinary labour in cultivating the earth  amounting for each person per annum to sixty∣two days of ordinary labour Days  For which every male of the above description shall annually sign indentures for the undermentioned portions of his labour viz        Days Work  Indenture for  Days Work    Do  Do    Do  Do    Indentures for  Do    Do  Do    Do  Hours work or ½ a day each    Do  Do or ¼ do    Do  Do or ⅓ do    Indentures  Days work of ordinary labour    The small portions of time are necessary to form a rateable medium for the prices  of all kinds of small articles in traffick and to afford a convenient exchange when the indentures are circulated like bills in lieu of cash and for such arti∣cles as may require a still smaller frac∣tion to express any gradual rising or fall of price the proper fraction of an hour into sixty minutes will be sufficiently small for all purposes and if any species of so small a value as  one minute  or even as five or fifteen minutes should be thought necessary small pieces of copper or other cheap metals amber or parti∣cular kinds of shells or beads may be substituted for it But if  indentures  for the sake of uniformity in the currency should be preferred an indenture for  ten minutes  the sixth part of an hour will amount exactly to  one farthing  at the lowest price of  ordinary labour  i e one shilling per day  In the indentures must be express'd the name of the township or of  the hundred  and  the number  or other denomination of the  tithing  or  dozen  wherein the signer lives and when the indenture is cut at the figured tally the signer of it shall keep the checque in his own possession but shall deliver the full number and value of his signed indentures into the Exchequer in the presence of the chief of the dozen to which he belongs If he himself is an  headborough  or chief of a dozen he shall deliver his inden∣tures in the presence of his  hundreder  or of three other  headboroughs  of the same hundred and the  hundreder himself  in the presence of four  headboroughs  of his own division  The entry or counter checque in the publick treasury of every man's accompt of indentures for which he is a debtor  to the publick shall be carefully exa∣mined and certified by the  Hundreders  or their assistants or at least by four of the Headboroughs of the particular division to which each debtor respectively belongs which will be very little trouble to each  chief  as the highest will certify only for families and the regula∣rity of the frankpledge and the  certain knowledge  of each individual in a divi∣sion which every chief obtains by it will effectually secure every individual from forgeries so that no man will be liable to answer any demands for labour but what may be amply proved and au∣thenticated by comparing the checques in his own hands with the certified entry in the Exchequer  Masters of  apprentices  and also of  in∣dentured strangers  brought by them into the settlement shall be obliged to register the said indentured persons in the  publick Exchequer of the township where he lives together with the terms of their indentures on the penalty of days labour for every wilful failure herein and he shall be obliged to deduct from the limited time of indentured service all the time that the apprentices or servants have worked for the publick benefit  When a man has worked out or otherwise redeemed any of the paper∣money for which he is nominally re∣sponsible and shall have received back the indenture after the service he may produce it at the Exchequer together with its corresponding checque that it may be cancelled in the publick ac∣compt whereby the discharge of pub∣lick debts may be as regularly proved and authenticated as the just demands abovementioned and the state of a man's publick debt may always be known at  the publick Exchequer by the balance of indentures in his accompt and thereby all frauds and impositions may be easily traced and detected  As  Labour  in all new settlements where land is cheap is of course much higher and more valuable than in old established states the intrinsic value of the labour in the proposed new settlement might fairly be estimated  at double the price  of labour in England but at present I will rate it only at  one shilling per day  on ac∣count of the limitation of eight hours instead of ten commonly required in England About males have already entered their names which number multiplied by sixtytwo the tax of days work due from each per annum by this regulation will produce days of labour in a year due to the publick which estimated at the low average rate of only s per day will amount to l  per annum And as the value or ex∣pence of labour when applied  to land  at the ordinary estimation of increase by the products of the earth in return for labour and care is expected to pro∣duce  at least triple the amount  of the disbursement even in our northern cli∣mates so the value of l bestowed in labour on the publick lots of land in the fertile and productive climate of Africa where very little labour is necessary might certainly be estimated much higher but even at the ordinary rate it will amount to l per annum which is a very great publick revenue if it be remembered that it is calculated on the very small number of males reckon∣ing rich and poor together which are only the ordinary average number of males in an  hundred division  or families of a well established settlement at the rate of three males to a family  The general contribution which I have proposed is  equally  laid on the poor as on the rich the former being  equally  capable of paying it and that certainly with more ease to themselves by being accustomed to  ordinary labour  Nevertheless the rich it may be said ought to contribute more than the poor on account of the superior advantages which accrue to them by their associa∣tion with the poor in one well regulated political body The superior advantages I speak of arest The  personal ease  or exemption from labour which their riches may always procure to them in such a societyand secondly the effec∣tual security of their property or wealth  procured in Frankpledge  or  "Maxima securitas"  by the equal exertion of persons who have  no property  and by an  equal  risque also  of their lives  in case of actual danger So that it seems clearly reasonable and just that the rich  and higher ranks of citizens should contribute  more to the publick revenue  than the poorbut in what proportion is rather difficult to determine though it may be readily answered that the quantity of riches should in due pro∣portion determine the quantity of con∣tribution yet this cannot be done with∣out a general  tax on property  which as experience teaches us is liable to many inconveniences so that even the antient and ordinary tax of  tithes  to the clergy is deemed grievously inconvenient on account of the difficulties disputes quarrels and vexations which too fre∣quently happen as well in compound∣ing for them as in the collection of them  in kind  The only expedient therefore which I am able to devise at present for procuring a larger contribution from the rich is a  tax on pride and indolence  a tax which though it will not produce in exact proportion to the property of  the wealthy will nevertheless most cer∣tainly obtain from the wealthy and luxurious a contribution exactly pro∣portionate to whatever  pride and indo∣lence  may be occasioned by the super∣fluous wealth of the community and in aid to this tax on  superfluous wealth  the  affluence  likewise of the more useful members of society whose employments procure them a more profitable reward than they could obtain by ordinary la∣bour might be made to yield a reason∣able addition to the revenue in conside∣ration of their superior abilities to con∣tribute which men of this respectable class certainly have  TAX  on  PRIDE  and  INDOLENCE  and on Persons who have superior Emoluments above the ordinary Class of Labourers  THOUGH  labour  is the common lot of man according to the divine sentence or penal judgment denounced against our first  male  parent  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return into the ground  c Gen iii and though an apostle also has de∣clared that  if any would not work neither should he eat  yet many persons there are in every community who by some means or other seem to be exempted from the necessity of  personal labour  the ordinary condition of human life How this may be accounted for and reconciled with the divine decree is stated more at large in my tract on the Law of Nature and Principles of Action  in Man p Nothing there∣fore according to  natural religion  can be more  reasonable  and  just  or more consistent also according to the second foundation of law with the  revealed will of God  in the holy scriptures than that all persons who have wealth sufficient to purchase an exemption from this  ordi∣nary lot of man  should be required to contribute in a larger proportion to the exigencies of the community than persons who depend on their  daily labour  for their  daily bread  And this additional contribution may very easily be levied without making any other ad∣ditional object of taxation than what I have already proposed to be the  single article  of general contribution viz  the two tenths of ordinary labour  let a re∣demption of the general tax of sixtytwo days' contribution viz two tenths of  ordinary labour  be required at the rate of a  double  or if necessary of a  triple  value of the service from all persons who having no real bodily infirmity or incapacity shall decline a  personal  attendance for the general contribution either through  pride  by setting them∣selves up above their brethren in their own estimation as superior to the com∣mon lot of  ordinary labour  or else by having a better and more reasonable mo∣tive that of a more profitable occupa∣tion for the employment of their time which will equally render them capable of paying without any actual hardship the additional tax for the  ease indulgence  and  superior profit  which they enjoy by the purchase  Suppose there be ten men in an hun∣dred or thirty males in  one hundred fa∣milies  whose pride or wealth or indo∣lence would induce them to decline personal labour such men ought surely to redeem their exemption at a  triple  value  which cannot amount to any real hardship or oppression as the alterna∣tive and only hardship to those who may  love too well their wealth and deem the tax too heavy  is to submit to the ordi∣nary lot of their brethren in complying with a short limited service for the pub∣lick benefit in which they themselves have an  equal  profit And suppose there be also double that number of persons in an hundred division who have useful arts and more profitable trades and occu∣pations to induce their redemption of  personal service  The produce of the tax will be as followsthe first class of thirty gentlemen or idle men taxed at triple the value of the sixtytwo days of ordinary labour will pay all together the sum of l but as the sixtytwo days of labour from each is already in∣cluded in the former general calculation one third must be deducted from the esti∣mated  value of this additional tax where by it is reduced to     l  s  d           The second class of merchants tradesman or useful artificers who will be induced by more profitable occupa∣tions to redeem their  personal labour  will each pay a  double tax  viz the value of days ordinary labour at s per day which all together is  only    l    s per ann each man  but as they are already charged half that sum in the general estimate of contribution the other half alone must here be reckoned viz l s which multiplied by amounts to        Total additional tax on the classes abovementioned in one hundred families        Which addition if laid out on the cultivation of land in the publick lots would produce  three times that value  according to the ordinary increase of land for the labour bestowed on it The risque indeed of a misapplica∣tion of the labour or of a defalcation of the increase may reasonably be objected according to the ordinary mis∣conduct of persons intrusted with the care of farms at present in this coun∣try but the same objection will not hold where  Frankpledge  is duly established because the eye of every neighbour would be a watchful guard against fraud all being equally interested in the pub∣lick profit I will therefore multiply this additional tax by the ordinary rate of increase to be expected from the land which is cultivated by it                 To which add the general contribu∣tion before estimated at        The total amount of revenue for one single division of an hundred families        Thus an ample source is opened not only of  publick credit  but also of  private security  or trust in traffick by the same easy means whereby poor labouring men may be enabled to obtain all the necessary articles of merchandize though they have no ready money to advance For as  ordinary labour  is rendered the  medium of traffic  instead of cash the first advantage to a poor industrious man ac∣customed only to  ordinary labour  is that he will at all times have it in his power to obtain employment in the search of which with us many honest men in all the three kingdoms are ob∣liged to leave their native country And the second material advantage to him is that he can always obtain an immediate credit proportionable to the value of his unengaged time for any articles of trade that he may want by giving the  mer∣chant  or  tradesman  in return for them an indenture for as many  days labour  as  the purchase is worth and he is also enabled to employ a  blacksmith car∣penter  or other useful  artificer  in case he should want their assistance on his own lot by giving them in like manner an indenture for as many days of  or∣dinary labour  as will amount to the value of the work These indentures as before proposed for the indentures of general contribution should express the names of the  hundred  and of the  dozen  in which the signer is associated and should be previously carried by him to be entered at the public Exchequer or bank of the hundred and be there properly certified as before proposed after which the labourer may cut off the indentures from his checques at the printed tally and pay them to the  mer∣chant  or  tradesman  for the article pur∣chased or to the  artificer  for his job retaining the checques in his own custody that he may always know the  amount of his  debt of labour  On the other hand the  merchant tradesman  or  artificer  who receives such an indenture from a poor labourer can immediately  realize  the value of it in his own favour by paying it into the public Exchequer or bank of the township where of course it will be posted to the credit of his accompt of labour and will enable him to redeem a part of his  own inden∣tures  without his  own personal labour  which of course is much more valuable than  ordinary labour  and in like manner he will proceed with all other indentures for  ordinary labour  that he has procured by his traffic or more valuable occupa∣tion always paying them to the credit of his account at the bank until the amount exceeds his own debt for public service when from the balance of labour in his favour according to the amount of it he will always be at liberty to draw on the bank for  indentures of days  work  either for  circulation  as ready cash or for  labourers  to cultivate his own lot of land or else occasionally to accom∣modate planters who want labourers and are willing to pay the value of them in  produce  c whereby  private credit  as well as  public credit  already provided for will be amply supported and the indentures for  labour  by which this most essential  public  and  private  service is effected will be in fact A PAPER CURRENCY OF INTRINSIC VALUE an∣swering all the purposes of  ready cash  as a medium of traffic as well as all the necessary purposes of  negociable bills  to support  public  and  private  credit and yet they cannot be at all liable to de∣preciation  The advantages appear to me so great and extraordinary that I can hardly give credit as I proceed to my own estima∣tion of them and am inclined to suspect  that I am in some way or other  enor∣mously mistaken  but as I cannot yet find out my error I must leave my censure to some more able head A few obvious objections however I am prepared to remove by a timely proposal of adequate remedies As for instanceWhatever might be deemed troublesome or dis∣agreeable in exacting the payment of these  debts of labour  may be effectually withdrawn  from individuals  by investing the  public bank of each township  with the sole authority of demanding the  labour  for the indentures that have been re∣spectively entered and certified therein And that the several banks may be enabled to realize the value of these indentures all applications either for  labourers  or  labour  shall be made at the several  town banks  where planters may be sure of a supply of labourers and the labourer equally sure of a constant supply of work without danger of op∣pression  or non payment of wages being secured from both by the media∣tion of the bank which employs him and disposes of his service And both parties or at least the  planters  ought to pay some small allowance per cent to the bank by way of commission or profit for the negociation And each bank should regularly summon with  due previous notice  for every day a suf∣ficient number of the indentured la∣bourers that are entered on their books not only to cultivate  the public lots of land  under their care but also to supply the current daily demand of labour that may be wanted by planters and other private individuals but all persons sum∣moned to labour shall work on the  public lots  until such demands are made by which means  the labourers will lose no time in waiting for work  The daily sum∣monses to labour issued from the bank should be made  in due rotation according  to the dates of the indentures entered on the books  and according to the quantity of debt which each individual has to work out And that no man may run deeper in debt by disposing of his labour to a greater amount than he may be able to discharge in due time all indentures whatsoever for the labour either of ap∣prentices or servants should be entered at the bank of the township where the parties reside whereby not only the state of every labourer's debt may be always known and of course likewise his ability to discharge it but also on the other hand the labourers apprentices and servants themselves will be thereby more easily protected from the oppression of such avaritious masters as might other∣wise be inclined to exact more service than is due by the terms of their contract  If any person should die before his indentured service is discharged to the  public  bank his land stock and effects shall be answerable to the amount of his deficiency to the  publick  in preference to all other debts whereby the  paper currency  will always preserve a  standard value  and at the same time afford a most convenient medium for traffic and exchange If any further difficulties more than I have foreseen and guarded against should still be objected I flatter myself that the salutary establishment of Frankpledge will be sufficient to obviate them all For this  maxima securitas  renders every individual completely re∣sponsible for all debts or demands that can justly be made upon him and for all charges against him whatever because the residence of the meanest member of society can be most expeditiously known by the public books so that he may be immediately traced at any time to his very chamber and no individual in  Frankpledge  can resist the united power  of a free peoplefor if any one should neglect or despise the summons of the public bank his  tithing  or dozen may be compelled on the penalty of a heavy fine for neglect to produce him and should the tithing or dozen neglect the hundred is summoned to enforce satis∣faction and so on with respect to higher divisions until the strength of the whole community is united as one man to render executive justice to  fine  or other∣wise punish all contumacious delinquents against common sense and to enforce obedience to the determined justice of the majority This occasional mention of  misdemeanors  and  fines  reminds me that I have omitted to add to the amount of my calculation of  Revenue  the profit of the  public fines  and  forfeitures  which must always be very considerable where  Frankpledge  is established not only because the regularity and order of the system renders the levying of  fines  and  forfeitures  extremely easy expeditious and free from expence but also because the penalties of  fines  and  forfeitures  are in Frankpledge extended to the  minutest immoralities  and  negligences  in order to render the peace and regularity of society as perfect as possible Add to this a very particular advantage which the ancient mode of punishing by  fines  and  forfeitures  will acquire by the applica∣tion of my proposal of universal calcula∣tion by  days labour  an advantage which could never before be obtained viz that the  poorest man  has thereby  some∣thing to forfeit  even sometimes very considerable because his  personal labour  is  equally valuable  and probably  more so  than the labour of a man of superior rank so that even the happy system of  Frankpledge itself  is very materially im∣proved and rendered much  more effectual  as well as more  profitable  by the pro∣posed addition  All contempts of legal summonses to  labour  would of course be  finable  as also  apparent sloth  or  remissness in work∣ing  both of which would thereby be made  effectual to increase the value of the paper currency  instead of diminishing it as might be expected Likewise all con∣tempts of court neglects of summons to attend juries want of punctuality in attending the duties of Watch and Ward in the rotation of the public roster and all inattention or disobedience while on duty all breaches of the sabbath swear∣ing drunkenness and immodesty as well as  fornication  and  adultery  both of which should be very strictly and very severely mulcted for the more effectual promotion of  honourable marriage  giving or accepting a challenge to fight even though no mischief should ensue all unnecessary wrangling fighting or striking and even every wilful provoca∣tion by word or gesture and every other  misbehaviour that is inconsistent with the peace order and quiet of a happy so∣ciety would be punished by a suitable  fine of days' work  in proportion to the offence by which altogether this essential article of  fines  and  forfeitures  which in England through  neglect of Frankpledge  are hardly an object of consideration would necessarily occasion a much larger addition to the  public revenue  than I can venture at present to estimate and therefore I must beg leave to  reserve  this valuable article of  fines  to make up any deficiencies which perhaps may be afterwards discovered in my other cal∣culations to which must also be added as a further reserve the profits arising from the  sale of land  for  day labour  not yet estimated though it would probably amount even to more than the fines  I have already without these profitable articles carried my estimation of the  public Revenue  nearly to the amount of l per annum for every families including equally both rich and poor which far exceeds the proportionable revenue I believe of any kingdom on earth for indeed the same means are  not practicable  in any country or nation unless the most excellent system of  Frankpledge  be previously established which I must frequently repeat But for the sake of comparison let us apply this scheme to the computed average number of taxable houses or families in England and Wales The one million families as they are commonly esti∣mated would raise by merely taking on themselves the very moderate and equal burthen of only a th part of their  most ordinary  labour estimated at the low rate of one shilling per day together with the additional  tax on pride  and the easy levy  on profitable occupations  with the due increase of the whole profit when applied  to  the cultivation of public land  would raise I say at the rate of l for every hundred families before calculated the amazing revenue of millions and thousands of pounds sterling per annum If I am questioned on the pos∣sibility of raising a sum so enormously great that it far exceeds the whole annual produce of all our accumulated taxes customs and other means of revenue I must confess that I am at a loss how even to satisfy my own doubts about it and that I know not what reasons to assign for such an incredible accumulation of wealth arising from so  trifling a burthen  laid upon the people unless it may be attri∣buted to the  effectual employment of all the labouring poor  and of
