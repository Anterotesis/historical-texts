 LEONIDAS A POEM    PIND OLYMP OD  LONDON  Printed for R DODSLEY at  Tully  's  Head  in  Pallmall  MDCCXXXVII  THE PREFACE  TO illustrate the following poem to vindicate the subject from the censure of improbability and to shew by the concurring evidence of the best historians that such disinterested public virtue did once exist I have thought it would not be improper to prefix the subsequent narration  WHILE Darius the father of Xerxes was yet on the throne of Persia Cleomenes and Demaratus were kings in Lacedaemon both descended from Hercules Demaratus was unfortunately expos'd by an uncertain rumour which render'd his legitimacy suspected to the  malice and treachery of his colleague who had conceiv'd a personal resentment against him for Cleomenes taking advantage of this report persuaded the Spartans to examine into the birth of Demaratus and refer the difficulty to the oracle of Delphi and was assisted in his perfidious designs by a near relation of Demaratus nam'd Leotychides who aspir'd to succeed him in his dignity Cleomenes found means to corrupt the priestess of Delphi who declar'd Demaratus not legitimate Thus by the base practices of his colleague Cleomenes and his kinsman Leotychides Demaratus was expell'd from his office of king in the commonwealth after having frequently signaliz'd his valour in its service He went into voluntary banishment and retiring to Asia was there protected by Darius while Leotychides succeeded to the regal authority in Sparta Upon the death of Cleomenes Leonidas was made king who rul'd in conjunction with this Leotychides when Xerxes the son of Darius invaded Greece The  number of land and naval forces which accompanied that monarch together with the servants women and other usual attendants on the army of an eastern prince amounted to upwards of five millions as reported by Herodotus who wrote within a few years after the event and publicly recited his history at the Olympic games In this general assembly not only from Greece itself but from every part of the world whereever a colony of Grecians was planted had he greatly exceeded the truth he must certainly have been detected and censur'd by some among so great a multitude and such a voluntary falshood must have entirely destroy'd that merit and authority which have procur'd to Herodotus the veneration of all posterity with the appellation of the father of history On the first news of this attempt upon their liberty a convention was immediately held at the Isthmus of Corinth compos'd of deputies from the several states of Greece to consult on proper measures for the public safety The Spartans  also sent messengers to enquire of the oracle at Delphi into the event of the war who return'd with an answer from the priestess of Apollo that either a king descended from Hercules must die or Lacedaemon would be entirely destroy'd Leonidas immediately offer'd to sacrifice his life for the safety of Lacedaemon and marching to Thermopylae possess'd himself of that important pass with three hundred of his countrymen who with the forces of some other cities in the Peloponnesus together with the Thebans Thespians and the troops of those states which adjoin'd to Thermopylae compos'd an army of near eight thousand men  XERXES was now advanc'd as far as Thessalia when hearing that a small body of Grecians was assembled at Thermopylae with some Lacedaemonians at their head and among the rest Leonidas a descendant of Hercules he dispatch'd a single horseman before to observe  their numbers and discover their designs When this horseman approach'd he could not take a view of the whole camp which lay conceal'd behind a rampart formerly rais'd by the Phocians at the entrance of Thermopylae so that his whole attention was employ'd on those who were on guard before the wall and who at that instant chanc'd to be the Lacedaemonians Their manner and gestures greatly astonish'd the Persian some were amusing themselves in gymnastic exercises others were combing their hair and all discover'd a total disregard of him whom they suffer'd to depart without molestation and report to Xerxes what he had seen which appearing to that prince quite ridiculous he sent for Demaratus who was with him in the camp and requir'd him to explain this strange behaviour of his countrymen Demaratus inform'd him that it was a custom among the Spartans to comb down and adjust their hair when they were determin'd to fight till the last extremity Xerxes notwithstanding  in the confidence of his power sent ambassadors to the Grecians to demand their arms to bid them disperse and become his friends and allies which proposals being receiv'd with disdain he commanded the Medes and Saces to seize on the Grecians and bring them alive into his presence These nations immediately attack'd the Grecians and were soon repuls'd with great slaughter fresh troops still succeeded but with no better fortune than the first being oppos'd to an enemy not only superiour in valour and resolution but who had the advantage of discipline and were furnish'd with better arms both offensive and defensive  PLUTARCH in his Laconic apothegms reports that the Persian king offer'd to invest Leonidas with the sovereignty of all Greece provided he would join his arms to those of Persia This offer was too considerable a condescension to have been made before a tryal of their force and must therefore have been propos'd by  Xerxes after such a series of ill success as might probably have depress'd the insolence of his temper and it may be easily suppos'd that the virtue of Leonidas was proof against any temptations of that nature Whether this be a fact or not thus much is certain that Xerxes was reduc'd to extreme difficulties by this resolute defence of Thermopylae till he was extricated from his distress by a Malian nam'd Epialtes who conducted twenty thousand of the Persian army into Greece through a pass which lay higher up the country among the mountains of Oeta whereas the passage at Thermopylae was situated on the seashore between the end of those mountains and the Malian bay The defence of the upper pass had been committed to a thousand Phocians who upon the first sight of the enemy inconsiderately abandon'd their station and put themselves in array upon a neighbouring eminence but the Persians wisely avoided an engagement and with the utmost expedition march'd to Thermopylae Leonidas  no sooner receiv'd information that the Barbarians had pass'd the mountains but he commanded the allies to retreat reserving the three hundred Spartans and four hundred Thebans whom as they follow'd him with reluctance at first he now compell'd to stay But the Thespians whose number amounted to seven hundred would not be persuaded by Leonidas to forsake him Their commander was Demophilus and the most eminent amongst them for his valour was Dithyrambus Among the Spartans the most conspicuous next to Leonidas was Dieneces who being told that the multitude of Persian arrows would obscure the sun replied the battle would then be in the shade Two brothers named Alpheus and Maron are also recorded for their valour and were Lacedaemonians Megistias a priest by birth an Acarnanian refus'd to desert Leonidas though intreated by him to consult his safety and retire but sent away his only son and remain'd himself behind to die with the Lacedaemonians Among  the three hundred Spartans were two call'd Eurytus and Aristodemus who being almost blind were dismiss'd by Leonidas Of these Aristodemus return'd home but Eurytus waited till the Persians descended from the hills and then commanding his slave to lead him among the combatants was slain with the rest of his countrymen  HERODOTUS relates that Leonidas drew up his men in the broadest part of Thermopylae where being surrounded by the Persians they fell with great numbers of their enemies but Plutarch Diodorus Siculus and others affirm that the Grecians attack'd the very camp of Xerxes in the night The action is thus describ'd by Diodorus  "The Grecians having now rejected all thoughts of safety preferring glory to life unanimously call'd on their general to lead them against the Persians before they could be appris'd that their friends had pass'd round the mountains  Leonidas embrac'd the occasion which the ready zeal of his soldiers afforded and commanded them forthwith to dine as men who were to sup in Elysium Himself in consequence of this command took a repast as the means to furnish strength for a long continuance and to give perseverance in danger After a short refreshment the Grecians were now prepar'd and receiv'd orders to assail the enemies camp to put all they met to the sword and force a passage to the royal pavilion when form'd into one compact body with Leonidas himself at their head they march'd against the Persians and enter'd their camp at the dead of night The Barbarians wholly unprepar'd and blindly conjecturing that their friends were defeated and themselves attack'd by the united power of Greece hurry together from their tents with the utmost disorder and consternation Many were slain by Leonidas and his party but much greater multitudes by their  own troops to whom in the midst of this blind confusion they were not distinguishable from enemies for as night took away the power of discerning truely and the tumult was spread universally over the camp a prodigious slaughter must naturally ensue The want of command of a watchword and of confidence in themselves reduc'd the Persians to such a state of confusion that they destroy'd each other without distinction Had Xerxes continu'd in the royal pavilion the Grecians without difficulty might have brought the war to a speedy conclusion by his death but he at the beginning of the tumult betook himself to flight with the utmost precipitation when the Grecians rushing into the tent put to the sword most of those who were left behind then while night lasted they rang'd through the whole camp in diligent search of the tyrant When morning appear'd the Persians perceiving the true state of things held the inconsiderable  number of their enemies in contempt yet were so terrified at their valour that they avoided a near engagement but inclosing the Grecians on every side shower'd their darts and arrows upon them at a distance and in the end destroy'd their whole body Such was the period of their lives who under the conduct of Leonidas defended the pass of Thermopylae Who can refrain from admiring the virtue of these men who with one consent maintaining the post allotted by their country chearfully renounc'd their lives for the common safety of Greece and esteem'd a glorious death more eligible than to live with dishonour Nor is the consternation of the Persians incredible Who among those Barbarians could have conjectur'd such an event who could have expected that five hundred men would have dar'd to attack a million Wherefore shall not all posterity from that day reflect on the virtue of these men as the object of imitation who though the loss of  their lives was the necessary consequence of their undertaking were yet unconquer'd in their spirit and among all the great names deliver'd down to remembrance are the only heroes who obtain'd more glory in their fall than others from the brightest victories With justice may they be deem'd the preservers of the Grecian liberty even preferably to those who were conquerors in the battles fought afterwards with Xerxes for the memory of their valour who fell at Thermopylae for ever dejected the Barbarians while the Greeks were fir'd with emulation to equal such a pitch of magnanimity Upon the whole there never were any before these who attain'd to immortality through the meer excess of virtue whence the praise of their fortitude has not been recorded by historians only but has been celebrated by numbers of poets among others by Simonides the lyric"  PAUSANIAS in his Laconics considers the defence of Thermopylae as an action superior to any atchiev'd by their cotemporaries and to all the exploits of preceding ages  "Never says he had Xerxes beheld Greece or laid in ashes the city of Athens had not his forces under Hydarnes been conducted through a path over Oeta and by that means incompassing the Greeks overcome and slain Leonidas"  Nor is it improbable that Leonidas should have maintain'd his post in so narrow a pass till the whole army of Xerxes had perish'd by famine At the same time the Persian navy had been miserably shatter'd by a storm and worsted in an engagement with the Athenians at Artemisium  To conclude the fall of Leonidas and his brave companions so meritorious to their country and so glorious to themselves has obtain'd such an high degree of veneration and applause  from past ages that few among the antient compilers of history have been silent on this amazing instance of magnanimity and zeal for liberty and many are the epigrams and inscriptions now extant some on the whole body others on particulars who died at Thermopylae still preserving their memory in every nation conversant with learning and at this distance of time still rendring their virtue the object of admiration and praise  I SHALL now detain the reader no longer than to take this public occasion of expressing my sincere regard for the LORD VISCOUNT COBHAM and the sense of my obligations for the early honour of his friendship To him I inscribe the following poem and herein might I be justified independent of all personal motives from his Lordship's public conduct so highly distinguish'd by his disinterested zeal and unshaken fidelity to his country not less in civil life  than in the field and to whom a poem founded on a character eminent for military glory and love of liberty is due from the nature of the subject  R GLOVER  LEONIDAS  BOOK I  The argument  Xerxes king of Persia having drawn together the whole force of his empire and pass'd over the Hellespont into Thrace with a design to conquer Greece the deputies from the several states of that country who had some time before assembled themselves at the Isthmus of Corinth to deliberate on proper measures for resisting the invader were no sooner appris'd of his march into Thrace than they determin'd without further delay to dispute his passage at the straits of Thermopylae the most accessible part of Greece on the side of Thrace and Thessaly Alpheus one of the deputies from Sparta repairs to that city and communicates this resolution to his countrymen who chanced that day to be assembled in expectation of receiving an answer from Apollo to whom they had sent a messenger to consult about the event of the war Leotychides one of their two kings counsels the people to advance no further than the Isthmus of Corinth which separates the Peloponnesus where Lacedaemon was situated from the rest of Greece but Leonidas the other king dissuades them from it Agis the messenger who had  been deputed to Delphi and brother to the queen of Leonidas returns with the oracle which denounces ruin to the Lacedaemonians unless one of their kings lays down his life for the publick Leonidas offers himself for the victim Three hundred Spartans are chosen to accompany him to Thermopylae and Alpheus returns to the Isthmus Leonidas after an interview with his queen departs from Lacedaemon At the end of six days he encamps near the Isthmus when he is join'd by Alpheus who describes the auxiliaries that wait at the Isthmus those who are already possess'd of Thermopylae as also the pass itself and concludes with a relation of the captivity of his brother Polydorus in Persia  REHEARSE O Muse the deeds and glorious death  Of that fam'd Spartan who withstood the pow'r  Of Xerxes near Thermopylae and fell  To save his country When from Asia's coast  With half the nations of the peopled globe  The Persian king the Hellespont had pass'd  And now in Thrace his boundless camp was spread  Soon to the Isthmus where th'assembled chiefs  Of Greece in anxious council long had sat  How best their menac'd liberties to guard  The dreadful tidings reach'd The near approach  Of Asia's lord determines their resolves  These they convey to all the Grecian states  Back to Eurotas' shores where Sparta rose  Laconian Alpheus speeds in council there  He finds the Spartan people with their kings  Their kings who boast an origin divine  From Hercules descended They the sons  Of Lacedaemon had conven'd to learn  The sacred mandates of th' immortal Gods  That morn expected from the Delphian dome  But in their presence Alpheus first appear'd  And thus address'd them For immediate war  Prepare O Spartans Xerxes' num'rous pow'rs  Already fill the trembling bounds of Thrace  The Isthmian council hath decreed to guard  The strait and rocky entrance into Greece  Thermopylae where ev'n a slender force  May stem the torrent of unnumber'd foes  HE said when Leotychides who shar'd  The rule with great Leonidas bespake  The Spartans thus My countrymen give ear  Why from her bosom should Laconia send  Her valiant sons to wage a distant war  For others' safety why exhaust her strength  And thin her numbers in defence of those  Who far remote from Lacedaemon dwell  Beyond the Isthmus there the Gods have plac'd  Our native ramparts there our empire's bound  And there alone our country claims our swords  HE ceas'd The people with assenting shouts  Replied when thus Leonidas began  O MOST ungen'rous counsel most unjust  And base desertion of the Grecian weal  What shall th'Athenians whose assiduous fleets  Undaunted watch th' innumerable foes  Where'er they menace our affrighted shores  And trust th' impending dangers of the field  To Sparta's wellknown valour shall they hear  That we disowning thus the gen'ral cause  Maintain the Isthmus only and expose  The rest of Greece ev'n Athens while she guards  Our naked coasts to all the waste of war  Her walls to ruin and her fields to flames  Her sons her matrons and her hoary sires  To violation servitude and shame  O should they hear such counsels guide our state  Would they not court the first propitious gale  To waft them far from such perfidious friends  And raise new seats in other climes remote  Safe from insulting foes and false allies  Then should we soon behold the proud array  Of Xerxes' navy with their hostile beaks  Affront our shores and deluge all our fields  With inexhausted numbers Half the Greeks  By us betray'd to bondage would support  The Persian king and lift th' avenging spear  For our destruction But my friends reject  Such mean and dang'rous counsels which will blast  Your long establish'd glories and assist  The proud invader O eternal king  Of Gods and mortals elevate our minds  Each low and partial passion thence dispel  Till this great truth in ev'ry heart be known  That none but those who aid the publick cause  Can shield their countries or themselves from chains  HE said by shame suppress'd each clam'rous voice  Was lost in silence till a gen'ral shout  Proclaim'd th' approach of Agis from the fane  Where taught by Phoebus on the Delphic hill  The Pythian maid his oracles reveal'd  He came but discontent and grief o'ercast  His anxious brow Reluctant he advanc'd  And now prepar'd to speak Th' impatient throng  Was gather'd round him motionless they stood  With expectation not a whisper told  The silent fear but all on Agis gaze  And still as death attend the solemn tale  As o'er the western waves when ev'ry storm  Is hush'd within its cavern and a breeze  Softbreathing lightly with its wings along  The slacken'd cordage glides the sailor's ear  Perceives no sound throughout the vast expanse  None but the murmurs of the sliding prowe  Which slowly parts the smooth and yielding main  So through the wide and listning croud no sound  No voice but thine O Agis broke the air  Declaring thus the oracle divine  I WENT to Delphi I enquir'd what fate  Was doom'd to Sparta from th'impending war  When thus th' allseeing deity replied  "Inhabitants of Sparta Persia's arms  "Shall lay your proud and ancient seat in dust  "Unless a king from Hercules deriv'd  "Cause Lacedaemon for his death to mourn"  AS when the hand of Perseus had disclos'd  The snakes of dirc Medusa all who view'd  The Gorgon features were congeal'd to stone  With ghastly eyeballs on the hero bent  And horrour living in their marble form  Thus with amazement rooted where they stood  And froze with speechless terrour on their kings  The Spartans gaz'd but soon their anxious looks  All on the great Leonidas unite  Long known his country's refuge He alone  Remains unshaken Rising he displays  His godlike presence Dignity and grace  Adorn his frame and manly beauty join'd  With strength Herculean On his aspect shines  Sublimest virtue and desire of fame  Where justice gives the laurel in his eye  The inextinguishable spark which fires  The souls of patriots while his brow supports  Undaunted valour and contempt of death  Serene he rose and thus address'd the throng  WHY this astonishment on ev'ry face  Ye men of Sparta Does the name of death  Create this fear and wonder O my friends  Why do we labour through the arduous paths  Which lead to virtue Fruitless were the toil  Above the reach of human feet were plac'd  The distant summit if the fear of death  Could intercept our passage But in vain  His blackest frowns and terrours he assumes  To shake the firmness of the mind which knows  That wanting virtue life is pain and woe  That wanting liberty ev'n virtue mourns  And looks around for happiness in vain  Then speak O Sparta and demand my life  My heart exulting answers to thy call  And smiles on glorious fate To live with fame  The Gods allow to many but to die  With equal lustre is a blessing Heav'n  Selects from all the choicest boons of fate  And with a sparing hand on few bestows  HE said New wonder fix'd the gazing throng  In silence Joy and Admiration sat  Suspending praise At length with high acclaim  The arch of heav'n resounded when amid  Th' assembly stood Dieneces and spake  SO from Thermopylae may Sparta's shouts  Affright the ear of Asia Haste my friends  To guard the gates of Greece which open stand  To Tyranny and Rapine They with dread  Will shrink before your standards and again  In servile Persia seek their native seats  Your wives your sons your parents general Greece  Forbid delay and equal to the cause  A chief behold can Spartans ask for more  HE ceas'd when Alpheus thus It well becomes  The Spartans held the chiefs of Greece and fam'd  For dauntless courage and unyielding hearts  Which neither want nor pain nor death can bend  To lead the rest to battle Then with speed  From all your number form a chosen band  While I returning will my seat resume  Among the Isthmian council and declare  Your instant march Our brave allies I deem  Now on the Isthmus wait the Spartan king  All but the Locrian and Boeotian force  With Phocis' youth appointed to secure  Thermopylae This said not long he paus'd  But with unwearied steps his course renews  NOW from th' assembly with majestic steps  Forth moves their godlike king with conscious worth  His gen'rous bosom glowing like his sire  Th' invincible Alcides when he trod  With ardent speed to face in horrid war  The triple form of Geryon or against  The bulk of huge Antaeus match his strength  SAY Muse who next present their dauntless breasts  To meet all danger in their country's cause  Dieneces advances sage and brave  And skill'd along the martial field to range  The order'd ranks of battle Maron next  To Alpheus dear his brother and his friend  Then rose Megistias with his blooming heir  Joy of his age and Menalippus call'd  Megistias wise and venerable seer  Whose penetrating mind as fame records  Could from the entrails of the victim slain  Before the altar and the mystic flight  Of birds foresee the dark events of time  Though sprung a stranger on the distant shore  Of Acarnania for his worth receiv'd  And hospitably cherish'd he the wreath  Pontific bore amid the Spartan camp  Serene in danger nor his sacred arm  From warlike toils secluding nor unskill'd  To wield the sword or poize the weighty spear  Him Agis follow'd brother to the queen  Of great Leonidas his friend in war  His tried companion Graceful were his steps  And gentle his demeanour Still his soul  Preserv'd its rigid virtue though refin'd  With arts unknown to Lacedaemon's race  High was his office He when Sparta's weal  Their aid and counsel from the Gods requir'd  Was sent the sacred messenger to learn  Their mystic will in oracles declar'd  From rocky Delphi and Dodona's shade  Or seaincircled Delos or the cell  Of dark Trophonius round Boeotia known  Three hundred more compleat th' intrepid band  BUT to his home Leonidas retir'd  There calm in secret thought he thus explor'd  His mighty soul while nature to his breast  A shortliv'd terrour call'd What sudden grief  What cold reluctance thus unmans my heart  And whispers that I fearCan death dismay  Leonidas so often seen and scorn'd  When clad most dreadful in the battle's front  Or to relinquish life in all its pride  With all my honours blooming round my head  Repines my soul or rather to forsake  Eternally forsake my weeping wife  My infant offspring and my faithful friends  Leonidas awake Shall these withstand  The public safety Lo thy country calls  O sacred voice I hear thee At that sound  Returning virtue brightens in my heart  Fear vanishes before her Death receive  My unreluctant hand and lead me on  Thou too O Fame attendant on my fall  With wings unwearied shalt protect my tomb  Nor Time himself shall violate my praise  THE hero thus confirm'd his virtuous soul  When Agis enter'd If till now my tongue  He thus began O brother has delay'd  To pay its grateful off'ring of the praise  Thy merit claims and only fill'd the cries  Of general applause forgive thy friend  Since her distresses hers whom most you love  Detain'd me from thee O unequall'd man  Though Lacedaemon call thy first regard  Forget not her who now for thee laments  In sorrows which fraternal love in vain  Hath strove to sooth Leonidas embrac'd  His gen'rous friend and thus replied Most dear  And best of men conceive not but my heart  Must still remember her from whom my life  Its largest share of happiness derives  Can I who yield my breath lest others mourn  Lest thousands should be wretched when she pines  More lov'd than any though less dear than all  Can I neglect her griefs In future days  If thou with grateful memory record  My name and fate O Sparta pass not this  Unheeded by The life I gave for thee  Knew not a painful hour to tire my soul  Nor were they common joys I left behind  SO spake the patriot and his heart o'erflow'd  With fondest passion then in eager haste  The faithful partner of his bed he sought  Amid her weeping children sat the queen  Immoveable and mute her swimming eyes  Fix'd on the earth Her arms were folded o'er  Her lab'ring bosom blotted with her tears  As when a dusky mist involves the sky  The moon through all the dreary vapours spreads  The radiant vesture of its silver light  O'er the dull face of nature so her charms  Divinely graceful shone upon her grief  Bright'ning the cloud of woe The chief approach'd  Soon as in gentlest phrase his wellknown voice  Her drooping mind awaken'd for a time  Its cares were hush'd she lifts her languid head  And thus gives utt'rance to her tender thoughts  O THOU whose presence is my only joy  If thus Leonidas thy looks and voice  Can dissipate at once the sharpest pangs  How greatly am I wretched who no more  Must hear that voice which lulls my anguish thus  Nor see that face which makes affliction smile  THIS said returning grief her breast invades  Her orphan children her devoted lord  Pale bleeding breathless on the field of death  Her everduring solitude of woe  All rise in mingled horrour to her sight  When thus in bitt'rest agony she spoke  O WHITHER art thou going from my arms  Shall I no more behold thee Oh no more  In conquest clad and wrapt in glorious dust  Wilt thou return to greet thy native soil  And make thy dwelling joyfull Yet too brave  Why wouldst thou hasten to the dreary gates  Of death uncall'd Another might have fall'n  Like thee a victim of Alcides' race  Less dear to all and Sparta been secure  Now ev'ry eye with mine is drown'd in tears  All with these babes lament their father lost  But oh how heavy is our lot of pain  Our sighs must last when ev'ry other breast  Exults with transport and the public joy  Will but increase our anguish Yet unmov'd  Thou didst not heed our sorrows didst not seek  A moment's pause to teach us how to bear  Thy endless absence or like thee to die  UNUTTERABLE sorrow here confin'd  Her voice These words Leonidas return'd  I SEE I feel thy anguish nor my soul  Has ever known the prevalence of love  E'er prov'd a father's fondness as this hour  Nor when most ardent to assert my fame  Was once my heart insensible to thee  How had it stain'd the honours of my name  To hesitate a moment and suspend  My country's fate till shameful life prefer'd  By my inglorious colleague left no choice  But what in me were infamy to shun  Not virtue to accept Then deem no more  That of thy love regardless or thy tears  I haste uncall'd to death The voice of Fate  The Gods my fame my country bid me bleed  Oh thou dear mourner wherefore streams afresh  That flood of woe Why heaves with sighs renew'd  That tender breast Leonidas must fall  Alas far heavier misery impends  O'er thee and these if soften'd by thy tears  I shamefully refuse to yield that breath  Which justice glory liberty and heav'n  Claim for my country for my sons and thee  Think on my long unalter'd love Reflect  On my paternal fondness Has my heart  E'er known a pause of love or pious care  Now shall that care that tenderness be prov'd  Most warm and faithful When thy husband dies  For Lacedaemon's safety thou wilt share  Thou and thy children the diffusive good  Should I thus singled from the rest of men  Alone intrusted by th 'immortal Gods  With pow'r to save a people should my soul  Desert that sacred cause thee too I yield  To sorrow and to shame for thou must weep  With Lacedaemon must with her sustain  Thy painful portion of oppression's weight  Thy sons behold now worthy of their names  And Spartan birth Their growing bloom must pine  In shame and bondage and their youthful hearts  Beat at the sound of liberty no more  On their own virtue and their father's fame  When he the Spartan freedom hath confirm'd  Before the world illustrious shall they rise  Their country's bulwark and their mother's joy  HERE paus'd the patriot With religious awe  Grief heard the voice of Virtue No complaint  The solemn silence broke Tears ceas'd to flow  Ceas'd for a moment soon again to stream  For now in arms before the palace rang'd  His brave companions of the war demand  Their leader's presence then her griefs renew'd  Too great for utt'rance intercept her sighs  And freeze each accent on her falt'ring tongue  In speechless anguish on the hero's breast  She sinks On ev'ry side his children press  Hang on his knees and kiss his honour'd hand  His soul no longer struggles to confine  Its strong compunction Down the hero's cheek  Down flows the manly sorrow Great in woe  Amid his children who inclose him round  He stands indulging tenderness and love  In graceful tears when thus with lifted eyes  Address'd to heav'n Thou everliving pow'r  Look down propitious sire of Gods and men  And to this faithful woman whose desert  May claim thy favour grant the hours of peace  And thou my great forefather son of Jove  O Hercules neglect not these thy race  But since that spirit I from thee derive  Now bears me from them to resistless fate  Do thou support their virtue be they taught  Like thee with glorious labour life to grace  And from their father let them learn to die  SO saying forth he issues and assumes  Before the band his station of command  They now proceed So mov'd the host of heav'n  Down from Olympus in majestic march  On Jove attendant to the flaming plains  Of Phlegra there to face the giant sons  Of Earth and Titan he before them tow'r'd  Thus through the streets of Lacedaemon pass'd  Leonidas Before his footsteps bow  The multitude exulting On he treads  Rever'd and honour'd Their inraptur'd sight  Pursues his graceful stature and their tongues  Extol and hail him as their guardian God  Firm in his nervous hand he grasps his spear  Down from his shoulders to his ankles hangs  The massy shield and o'er his burnish'd helm  The purple plumage nods Harmonious youths  Around whose brows entwining laurels play'd  In loftysounding strains his praise record  While snowyfinger'd virgins all the ways  With od'rous garlands strew'd His bosom now  Was all possess'd with glory which dispell'd  Whate'er of grief remain'd or fond regret  For those he left behind The rev'rend train  Of Lacedaemon's senate now approach'd  To give their solemn last farewel and grace  Their hero's parting steps Around him flow'd  In civil pomp their venerable robes  Mix'd with the blaze of arms The radiant troop  Of warriours press'd behind him Maron here  With Menalippus warm in flow'ry prime  And Agis there with manly grace advanc'd  Dieneces and Acarnania's seer  Megistias sage The Spartan dames ascend  The loftiest domes and thronging o'er the roofs  Gaze on their sons and husbands as they march  So parted Argo from th' Iolchian strand  And plough'd the foaming surge Thessalia's nymphs  Their hills forsaking and their hallow'd groves  Rang'd on the cliffs which overshade the deep  Still on the distant vessel fix'd their sight  Where Greece her chosen heroes had embark'd  To seek the dangers of the Cholchian shore  SWIFT on his course Leonidas proceeds  Soon is Eurotas pass'd and Lerna's banks  Where his unconquer'd ancestor subdu'd  The manyheaded Hydra and with fame  Immortaliz'd the lake Th'unwearied bands  Next through the pines of Maenalus he led  And down Parthenius urg'd the rapid toil  Six days incessant thus the Spartans march  When now they hear the hoarseresounding tide  Beat on the Isthmus Here their tents they spread  Below the wide horizon then the sun  Had sunk his beamy head The queen of night  Gleam'd from the center of th'ethereal vault  And o'er the dusky robe of darkness shed  Her silver light Leonidas detains  Dieneces and Agis Open stands  The tall pavilion and admits the moon  As here they sat conversing from the hill  Which rose before them one of noble port  Appears with speed descending Lightly down  The slope he treads and calls aloud They heard  And knew the voice of Alpheus From their seats  They rose and thus Leonidas began  O THOU whom heav'n with swiftness hath endu'd  To match the ardour of thy daring soul  What calls thee from the Isthmus Do the Greeks  Neglect to arm nor face the public foe  I COME to meet thee Alpheus thus return'd  A messenger who gladsome tidings bears  Through Greece the voice of liberty is heard  And all unfold their banners in her cause  The Thebans only with reluctant hands  Arcadia's sons with morning shalt thou join  Who on the Isthmus wait thy great command  With Diophantus Mantinéa sends  Five hundred spears nor less from Tegea's walls  With Hegesander move A thousand more  Who in Orchomenus reside who range  Along Parrhasius and Cyllene's brow  Or near the foot of Erymanthus dwell  Or on Alphéus' banks with various chiefs  Attend thy call but most is Clonius fam'd  Of stature huge unshaken as a rock  His giant bulk the line of war sustains  Four hundred warriours brave Alcmaeon draws  From stately Corinth's tow'rs Two hundred march  From Phlius whom Eupalamus commands  An equal number of Mycenae's race  Aristobulus heads Through fear alone  Of thee and threatning Greece the Thebans arm  To these inglorious Greeks my self repair'd  Their dying sense of honour to recal  A few corrupted by the Persian gold  Unjust dominion have usurp'd in Thebes  These in each bosom quell the gen'rous flame  Of liberty The eloquent they bribe  With specious tales the multitude they cheat  And prostitute the name of public good  To veil oppression Others are immers'd  In all the sloth of riches and unmov'd  In shameful ease behold their country fall  I first implor'd their senate's instant aid  But they with artful wiles demanding time  For consultation I address'd them thus  The shortest moment may suffice to know  If to die free be better than to serve  But if deluding Greece by vain delays  You mean to shew your friendship to the foe  You cannot then deliberate too long  How to withstand her swiftavenging wrath  Approaching with Leonidas This heard  Four hundred warriours they appoint to march  The wily Anaxander is their chief  With Leontiades I saw their march  Begun then hasten'd to survey the straits  Which thou shalt render sacred to renown  Where ever mingling with the crumbling soil  Which moulders round the Malian bay the sea  In slimy surges rolls upon the rock  Which forms the utmost limit of the bay  Thermopylae is stretch'd Where broadest spread  It measures threescore paces bounded here  By the deep ooze which underneath presents  Its dreary surface there the lofty cliffs  Of woody Oeta overlook the pass  And far beyond o'er half the surge below  Their horrid umbrage cast Across the straits  An ancient bulwark of the Phocians stands  A wall with turrets crown'd In station here  I found the Locrians and from Thespia's gates  Sev'n hundred more Demophilus hath led  His brother's son attends him to the camp  Young Dithyrambus greatly fam'd in war  But more for temperance of mind renown'd  Lov'd by his country and with honours grac'd  His early bloom with brightest glory shines  Nor wantons in the blaze Here Agis spake  WELL hast thou painted that illustrious youth  He was my host at Thespia Though adorn'd  With highest deeds by fame and fortune crown'd  His gentle virtues take from envy's mouth  Its blasting venom and her baneful face  Strives on his worth to smile In silence all  Again remain and Alpheus thus pursues  A CHOSEN troop hath bold Plataea sent  Small in its numbers but unmatch'd in arms  Above the rest Diomedon their chief  Excels in prowess Signal were his deeds  Upon that day of glory when the fields  Of Marathon were hid with Persian slain  These guard Thermopylae Among the hills  A winding path to stranger's feet unknown  Affords another entrance into Greece  This by a thousand Phocians is secur'd  HERE Alpheus paus'd Leonidas embrac'd  The noble Spartan and rejoin'd Thou know'st  What fate to me th' immortal Gods ordain  Frame now thy choice Accompany our march  Or go to Lacedaemon and relate  How thy discerning mind and active limbs  Have serv'd thy country From th' impatient mouth  Of Alpheus streight these fervent accents broke  I HAVE not measur'd such a tract of land  Not look'd unwearied on the setting sun  And through the shade of midnight urg'd my steps  To rouse the Greeks to battle that myself  Might be exempted from the glorious toil  Return Oh no A second time my feet  Shall visit thee Thermopylae and there  With great Leonidas shall Alpheus find  An honourable grave And oh amid  His country's danger if a Spartan breast  May feel a private sorrow not alone  For injur'd Greece I hasten to revenge  But for a brother's wrongs A younger hope  Than I or Maron bless'd our father's years  Child of his age and Polydorus nam'd  His mind while tender in its op'ning prime  Was bent to rigid virtue Gen'rous scorn  Of pain and danger taught his early strength  To struggle patient with severest toils  Oft when inclement winter chill'd the air  And frozen show'rs had swoln Eurotas' stream  Amid th' impetuous channel would he plunge  And breast the torrent On a fatal day  As in the sea his active limbs he bath'd  A servile corsair of the Persian king  My brother naked and defenceless bore  Ev'n in my sight to Asia there to waste  With all the promise of its growing worth  His youth in bondage Never can my tongue  My pains recount much less my father's woes  The days he wept the sleepless nights he beat  His aged bosom And shall Alpheus' spear  Be absent from Thermopylae nor claim  O Polydorus vengeance for thy bonds  In that first slaughter of the barb'rous foe  HERE interpos'd Dieneces The hands  Of Alpheus and Leonidas he grasp'd  And joyful thus Your glory wants no more  Than that Lycurgus should himself arise  To praise the virtue which his laws inspire  THUS pass'd these heroes till the dead of night  The hours in friendly converse and enjoy'd  Each other's virtue happiest of men  At length with gentle heaviness the hand  Of sleep invades their eyelids On the ground  Oppress'd with slumber they extend their limbs  When sliding down the hemisphere the moon  Now plung'd in midnight gloom her silver head  End of the First Book  LEONIDAS BOOK II  The argument  Leonidas on his approach to the Isthmus is met by the leaders of the troops sent from other Grecian states and by the deputies who compos'd the Isthmian council He harangues them then proceeds in conjunction with the other forces towards Thermopylae is join'd by Dithyrambus and arrives at the straits about noon on the fourth day after his departure from the Isthmus He is receiv'd at Thermopylae by the Thespian commander Demophilus and by Anaxander the Theban treacherously recommending Epialtes a Malian who seeks by a pompous description of the Persian power to intimidate the Grecian leaders as they are viewing the enemies camp from the top of mount Oeta He is answer'd by Dieneces and Diomedon Xerxes sends Tigranes and Phraortes to the Grecian camp who are dismiss'd by Leonidas and conducted back by Dithyrambus and Diomedon which last incens'd with the insolence of Tigranes treats him with contempt and menaces This occasions a challenge to single combat between Diomedon and Tigranes Dithyrambus and Phraortes Epialtes after a conference with Anaxander declares his intention of returning to Xerxes  AURORA spread her purple beams around  When mov'd the Spartans Their approach is known  The Isthmian council and the various chiefs  Who led th' auxiliar bands proceed to meet  Leonidas Eupalamus the strong  Alcmaeon Clonius Diophantus brave  And Hegesander At their head advanc'd  Aristobulus whom Mycenae's youth  Attend to war Mycenae once elate  With pow'r and dazzling wealth and vaunting still  The name of Agamemnon who along  The seas of Asia open'd to the wind  Unnumber'd sails and darken'd half the shore  Of trembling Phrygia with the hostile shade  Aristobulus join'd the Spartan king  And thus began Leonidas survey  Mycenae's race Should ev'ry other Greek  Be aw'd by Xerxes and his Asian host  Believe not we can fear deriv'd from those  Who once conducted o'er the foaming surge  The strength of Greece who desert left the fields  Of ravag'd Asia and her proudest walls  From their foundations humbled to the dust  LEONIDAS replied not but address'd  The chiefs around Illustrious warriours hail  Who thus undaunted signalize your faith  And gen'rous ardour in the common cause  But you whose counsels prop the Grecian state  O venerable synod whose decrees  Have call'd us forth to vanquish or to die  Thrice hail Whate'er by valour we obtain  Your wisdom must preserve With piercing eyes  Each Grecian state contemplate and discern  Their various tempers Some with partial care  To guard their own neglect the publick weal  Cold and unmov'd are others Terrour here  And there corruption reigns O fire the brave  With gen'rous zeal to quit their native walls  And join their valour in the gen'ral cause  Confirm the wav'ring animate the cold  And watch the faithless some there are betray  Themselves and Greece their perfidy prevent  Or call them back to honour Let us all  Be link'd in sacred union and the Greeks  Shall stand the world's whole multitude in arms  If for the spoil which Paris bore to Troy  A thousand barks the Hellespont o'erspread  Shall not again confederated Greece  Be rous'd to battle and to freedom give  What once she gave to fame Behold we haste  To stop th' invading tyrant Till we bleed  He shall not pour his millions on your plains  But as the Gods conceal how long our strength  May stand unconquer'd or how soon must fall  Waste not a moment till consenting Greece  Range all her freeborn numbers in the field  LEONIDAS concludes when awful step'd  Before the sage assembly one whose head  Was hoar with aged snow and thus replied  THY great example ev'ry heart unites  From thee her happiest omens Greece derives  Of concord freedom victory and fame  Go then O first of mortals and impress  Amaze and terrour in the Persians breast  The freeborn Greeks instructing life to deem  Less dear than virtue and their country's cause  THIS heard Leonidas thy secret soul  Exulting tasted of the sweet reward  Due to thy name from endless time His eyes  Once more he turn'd and view'd in rapt'rous thought  His native land which he alone can save  Then summon'd all his majesty and o'er  The Isthmus trod Behind the Grecians move  In deep arrangement So th' imperial bark  With stately bulk along the beating tide  In military pomp conducts the pow'r  Of some proud navy bounding from the port  To bear the vengeance of a mighty state  Against a tyrant's walls The Grecians march  Till noon when halting as they take repast  Upon the plain before them they descry  A troop of Thespians One above the rest  In eminence precedes His glitt'ring shield  Whose spacious orb collects th' effulgent beams  Which from his throne meridian Phoebus cast  Flames like another sun A snowy plume  Falls o'er his dazzling cask In wanton curls  Which floated in the breathing air around  The lofty crest it wav'd Approaching near  Beneath the honours of his radiant helm  The warriour now a countenance display'd  Where youth in rosy prime with sweetness mix'd  Its manly beauty With such modest grace  Respectful near Leonidas he came  As all ideas of his own desert  Were lost in veneration Phoebus thus  Appears before his everlasting sire  When from his altar in th' imbow'ring grove  Of palmy Delos or the hallow'd bound  Of Tenedos or Claros where he hears  His hymns and praises from the sons of men  He reascends the high Olympian seats  Such reverential awe his brow invests  Diffusing o'er the glowing flow'r of youth  New loveliness and grace The king receives  Th' illustrious Thespian and began My tongue  Would call thee Dithyrambus for thou bear'st  All in thy aspect to become that name  For valour known and virtue O reveal  Thy birth and charge whoe'er thou art my soul  Desires to know thee and would call thee friend  TO whom the youth return'd O first of Greeks  My name is Dithyrambus which the lips  Of some benevolent and gen'rous friend  To thee have sounded with a partial voice  And thou hast heard with favourable ears  I come deputed by the Thespian chief  The Theban and the Locrian and the brave  Diomedon to hasten thy approach  Three days will bring the Persian pow'rs in view  HE ceas'd At once the standards are uprear'd  The host till ev'ning with impetuous pace  Their march continue Through the earliest dews  Of morning they proceed and reach the pass  E'er the fourth sun attain'd the sult'ry noon  To their impatient sight no sooner rose  The rocks of Oeta but with rapid feet  And martial sounds of joy they rush'd along  As if the present deity of Fame  Her temples with unfading laurels bound  And in her hand her adamantine trump  Had from the hills her radiant form disclos'd  And bade their valour hasten to the field  That she their acts beholding might resound  Their name and glory o'er the earth and seas  Before the van Leonidas advanc'd  His eye confess'd the ardour of his mind  Which thus found utt'rance from his eager lips  ALL hail Thermopylae and you the pow'rs  Which here preside All hail ye silvan Gods  Ye fountain nymphs who pour your lucid rills  In broken murmurs down the rugged steep  Receive us O benignant and support  The cause of Greece Conceal the secret paths  Which o'er the crags and through the forests wind  Untrod by human feet and trac'd alone  By your immortal footsteps O defend  Your own recesses nor let impious war  Profane the solemn silence of your groves  Thus on your hills your praises shall you hear  From those whose deeds shall tell th' approving world  That not to undeservers did you grant  Your high protection You my valiant friends  Now rouse the gen'rous spirit which inflames  Your breasts now prove the vigour of your arms  That your recorded actions may survive  Within the breasts of all the brave and free  And sound delightful in the ear of Time  As long as Neptune beats the Malian bay  Or those tall cliffs erect their shaggy tops  So near to heav'n your monuments of fame  As in some torrid region where the head  Of Ceres bends beneath its golden load  If on the parching ground a fatal spark  Fall from a burning brand the sudden blaze  Increas'd and aided by tumultuous winds  In rapid torrents of involving flames  Sweeps o'er the crackling plain and mounting high  In ruddy spires illumines half the skies  Not with less swiftness through the glowing ranks  The words of great Leonidas diffus'd  A more than mortal fervour Ev'ry heart  Distends with great ideas such as raise  The patriot's virtue and the soldier's fire  When danger in its most tremendous form  Seems to their eyes most lovely In their thoughts  Imagination pictures all the scenes  Of war the purple field the heaps of death  And glitt'ring trophies pil'd with Persian arms  BUT now the Grecian leaders who before  Were station'd near Thermopylae accost  The Spartan king The Thespian chief allied  To Dithyrambus first the silence broke  An ancient warriour From behind his casque  Whose crested weight his aged temples press'd  His slender hairs which time had silver'd o'er  Flow'd venerable down He thus began  JOY now shall crown the period of my days  And whether with my father's dust I sleep  Or slain by Persia's sword I press the earth  Our common parent be it as the Gods  Shall best determine For the present hour  I bless their bounty which has giv'n my age  To see the great Leonidas and bid  The hero welcome on this glorious shore  Where he by heav'n selected from mankind  Shall fix the basis of the Grecian weal  HERE too the wily Anaxander spake  Hail glorious chief Of all the Theban race  We shall at least with gladsome bosoms meet  The great defender of the Grecian cause  O may oblivion o'er the shame of Thebes  Its darkest wing extend or they alone  Be curs'd by Fame whose impious counsels turn  Their countrymen from virtue Thebes alas  Still had been buried in dishonest sloth  Had not to wake her languor Alpheus come  The messenger of freedom O accept  Our grateful hearts thou Alpheus art the cause  That Anaxander from his native gates  Here hath not borne a solitary spear  Nor these inglorious in their walls remain'd  But longer do we loiter Haste my friends  To yonder cliff which points its shade afar  And view the Persian camp The morning sun  Beheld their numbers hide th' adjacent plains  Lo here a Malian Epialtes nam'd  Who with the foe from Thracia's bounds hath march'd  HE said His seeming virtue all deceiv'd  The camp not long had Epialtes join'd  By race a Malian Eloquent his tongue  But false his heart and abject He was skill'd  To grace perfidious counsels and to cloath  In swelling phrase the baseness of his soul  Foul nurse of treasons To the tents of Greece  Himself a Greek a faithless spy he came  Soon to the friends of Xerxes he repair'd  The Theban chiefs and nightly consult held  How best with consternation to deject  The Spartan valour or how best betray  With him the leaders climb the arduous hill  From whence the dreadful prospect they command  Where endless plains by white pavilions hid  Spread like the vast Atlantic when no shore  No rock or promontory stops the sight  Unbounded as it wanders but the moon  Resplendent eye of night in fullest orb  Throughout th' interminated surface throws  Its rays abroad and decks in snowy light  The dancing billows such was Xerxes' camp  A pow'r unrivall'd by the greatest king  Or conqueror that e'er with ruthless hands  Dissolving all the sacred ties which bind  The happiness of nations have alarm'd  The sleeping fury Discord from her den  Not from the hundred brazen gates of Thebes  The tow'rs of Memphis and the pregnant fields  By Nile's prolifick torrents delug'd o'er  E'er flow'd such armies with th' Aegyptian lord  Renown'd Sesostris who with trophies fill'd  The vanquish'd earth and o'er the rapid foam  Of distant Tanais and the huge expanse  Of trembling Ganges spread his dreaded name  Nor yet in Asia's far extended bounds  E'er met such numbers not when Belus drew  Th' Assyrian bands to conquest or the pride  Of highexalted Babylon survey'd  The plains along Euphrates cover'd wide  With armed myriads swarming from her walls  When at the rage of dire Semiramis  Peace fled affrighted from the ravag'd East  Yet all this hideous face of war dismays  No Grecian heart Unterrified they stood  Th' immeasurable camp with fearless eyes  They traverse while in meditation near  The treach'rous Malian waits collecting all  His pomp of words to paint the hostile pow'r  Nor yet with falshood arms his fraudful tongue  To feign a tale of terrour Truth herself  Beyond the reach of fiction to inhance  Now aids his treason and with cold dismay  Might pierce the boldest breast unless secur'd  By dauntless virtue which disdains to live  From liberty divorc'd Requested now  By ev'ry voice the traitor spake and all  Attentive ears incline Oh Greeks and friends  Can I behold my native Malian fields  Presenting hostile millions to your sight  And not with grief suppress the horrid tale  Which you exact from these illomen'd lips  On Thracia's sands I first beheld the foe  When joining Europe with the Asian shore  A mighty bridge th' outragious waves restrain'd  And stem'd th' impetuous current while in arms  The universal progeny of men▪  Seem'd all before me trampling o'er the sea  By thousands and ten thousands Persians Medes  Assyrians Saces Indians swarthy files  From Aethiopia Aegypt's tawny sons  Arabians Bactrians Parthians all the strength  Of Libya and of Asia Neptune groan'd  Beneath the burthen and indignant heav'd  His neck against th' incumbent weight In vain  The violence of Boreas and the West  With rage combin'd against th' unshaken pile  Dash'd half the Hellespont The eastern world  Sev'n days and nights uninterrupted pass  And pour on Thracia's confines They accept  The Persian lord and range their hardy race  Beneath his standards Macedonia's youth  With all Thessalia next and ev'ry Greek  Who dwells beyond Thermopylae attend  Thus not alone embodied Asia lifts  Her threatning lance but Macedon and Thrace  Whose martial loins with daring warriours teem  And faithless Greeks in multitudes untold  The Persian Monarch aid Celestial pow'rs  And thou who reignest over men and Gods  Who in a moment by thy will supreme  Canst quell the mighty in their proudest hopes  And raise the weak to safety thou impart  Thy instant succour interpose thy arm  With lightning blast their legions Oh confound  With triplebolted thunder Persia's camp  Whence like an inundation with the morn  Shall millions rush and overwhelm the Greeks  Resistance else were vain against an host  Which covers all Thessalia for beyond  The Malian plains thus widely stretch'd below  Beyond the utmost measure of the sight  Bent from the height of this aspiring cliff  Lie yet more hideous numbers which might drain  The streams of copious rivers with their thirst  And with their arrows hide the midday sun  THEN shall we join our battle in the shade  Dieneces replied Not calmly thus  Diomedon On Xerxes' camp he bends  His low'ring brow which frowns had furrow'd o'er  And thus exclaim'd Bellona turn and view  With joyful eyes that field the fatal stage  Which regal madness hath for you prepar'd  To exercise your horrours Thou O Death  Shalt riot here unceasing when the rocks  Of yonder pass with bleeding ranks are strew'd  And all who shun th' avenging steel of Greece  By pestilence and meager famine seiz'd  Shall with variety of ruin feast  Thy unabated hunger Thus he spake  While on the host immense his gloomy eyes  He fix'd disdainful and its strength defied  MEANTIME within th' entrenchment of the Greeks  From Asia's monarch delegated came  Tigranes and Phraortes From the hills  Leonidas conducts th' impatient chiefs  Around the hero in his tent they throng  When thus Tigranes their attention calls  AMBASSADORS from Persia's king we stand  Before you Grecians To display the pow'r  Of our great master were a needless task  The name of Xerxes Asia's mighty lord  Invincible and seated on a throne  Surpassing human lustre must have reach'd  Th' extremest border of the earth and taught  The hearts of men to own resistless force  With awe and low submission Yet I swear  By yon refulgent orb which flames above  The glorious symbol of th' eternal pow'r  This military throng this shew of war  Persuade me you have never heard that name  At whose dread sound the billows wide remote  Of Indus tremble and the Caspian wave  Th' Aegyptian tide and Hellespontic surge  With homage roll O impotent and rash  Whom yet the large beneficence of heav'n  And our great monarch merciful and kind  Deign to preserve Resign your arms disperse  Each to your cities there with humblest hands  Before your lord bestrew the way with flow'rs  AS through th' extensive grove whose leafy boughs  Intwining crown some eminence with shade  The tempests rush sonorous and between  The crashing branches roar by fierce disdain  And indignation thus the Grecians mov'd  With clam'rous murmurs close the Persian's speech  But Sparta's king arising all is hush'd  In sudden silence when he thus replied  O PERSIAN when to Xerxes thou return'st  Say thou hast told the wonders of his pow'r  Then say thou saw'st a slender band of Greece  Which dares his boasted millions to the field  THE Spartan said Th'Ambassadors retire  Them o'er the limits of the Grecian lines  Diomedon and Thespia's youth conduct  With slow solemnity they all proceed  In sullen silence But their looks denote  What speech would shame and weaken Wrath contracts  The forehead of Diomedon His teeth  Gnash with impatience for delay'd revenge  Disdain which sprung from conscious merit flush'd  The cheek of Dithyrambus On the face  Of either Persian insolence and pride  Incens'd by disappointment gloomy low'r'd  But when they reach'd the limits of the straits  Where Xerxes' camp began to open wide  Its deep immense arrangement then the heart  Of vain Tigranes swelling at the sight  Thus overflows in loud and haughty phrase  O ARIMANIUS origin of ill  Have we demanded of thy ruthless pow'r  Thus with the curse of madness to afflict  These wretched men But since thy dreadful will  To irresistible perdition dooms  The sons of Greece in vain should we oppose  Be thy dire will accomplish'd let them fall  And fatten with their blood their native soil  ENRAG'D the stern Diomedon replies  Thou servile base dependent on a king  Inglorious mercenary slave to those  Whom most we scorn thou boaster dost thou know  That I beheld the Marathonian field  When like the Libyan sands before the wind  Your host was scatter'd by th'unconquer'd Greeks  Where thou perhaps didst turn before this arm  To ignominious flight thy shiv'ring limbs  O may I find thee in to morrow's fight  Then on this rocky pavement shalt thou lie  Beneath this arm to feast the vulture's beak  HE ended here and thus the Persian chief  O thou whose hand omnipotent protects  The throne of Xerxes bend thy sacred ear  For lo my first victorious fruits of war  To thee I here devote the gory spoils  Which from this Grecian with the rising dawn  In sight of either host my arm shall rend  PHRAORTES interrupting then began  I too would find among the Grecian chiefs  One who in battle dare abide my spear  TO him thus answer'd Thespia's gallant youth  Thou look'st on me O Persian Worthier far  Thou mightst indeed have singled from our host  But none more willing to essay thy force  Yes I will prove before the eye of Mars  How far the valour of the meanest Greek  Beyond thy vaunts deserves the palm of fame  THIS said the Persians to their king repair  Back to their camp the Grecians There they found  Each soldier poizing his extended spear  And his large buckler bracing on his arm  For instant war prepar'd Through all the files  Each leader moves exulting and with praise  And exhortations aids their native warmth  Alone the Theban Anaxander pin'd  Who thus apart address'd his Malian friend  WHAT has thy lofty eloquence avail'd  Alas in vain attempting to confound  The Spartan valour With redoubled fires  See how their bosoms glow They wish to die  And wait impatient for th' unequal fight  Too soon will come th' insuperable foes  And in promiscuous ruin all be whelm'd  Nor shall our merit to the Persian lord  Be told or known for whose advent'rous feet  To serve the Thebans through the guarded pass  The Grecian watch eluding will approach  The tents of Asia that the king may know  And spare his friends amid the gen'ral wreck  When his highswoln resentment like a flood  Increas'd with stormy show'rs shall cover Greece  With desolation Epialtes here  WHENCE Anaxander this unjust despair  Is there a path on Oeta's hills unknown  To Epialtes O'er the trackless rock  And mazy grove shall pass my secret steps  This night I part Thy merit shall be told  To Persia's king Thou only watch the hour  Nor then be tardy when he wants thy aid  End of the Second Book  LEONIDAS BOOK III  The argument  Tigranes and Phraortes repair to Xerxes whom they find seated on a throne surrounded by his satraps in a magnificent pavilion while the Magi stand before him and sing an hymn containing the religion of Zoroastres Xerxes notwithstanding the arguments of his brothers Hyperanthes and Abrocomes gives no credit to the ambassadors who report that the Grecians are determin'd to maintain the pass against him but commands Demaratus an exil'd king of Sparta to attend him and ascends his chariot to take a view of the Grecians himself He passes through the midst of his army consisting of many nations differing in arms customs and manners He advances to the entrance of the straits and surpris'd at the behaviour of the Spartans demands the reason of it from Demaratus which occasions a conversation between them on the mercenary forces of Persia and the militia of Greece Demaratus weeping at the fight of his countrymen is comforted by Hyperanthes Xerxes still incredulous commands Tigranes and Phraortes to bring the Grecians bound before him the next day and retires to his pavilion  NOW had Tigranes and Phraortes gain'd  The splendid tent of Xerxes Him they found  Begirt with princes and illustrious chiefs  The potentates of Asia Near his side  His valiant brothers stood Abrocomes  And Hyperanthes then Pharnuchus brave  Pandates Intaphernes mighty lords  And numbers more in purple splendour clad  With homage all attending round the throne  Whose gorgeous seat erected high upbore  Their regal master He above their heads  Look'd down imperious So the stately tow'r  Of Belus mingling its majestick front  With heav'n's bright azure from on high survey'd  The huge extent of Babylon with all  Its sumptuous domes and palaces beneath  That day the monarch deem'd to enter Greece  And hide her fields with war but first ordains  That grateful hymns should celebrate the name  Of Oromasdes so the Persians call'd  The world's great author By the king's decree  The Magi stood before th' unfolded tent  Fire blaz'd beside them Tow'rds the sacred flame  They turn'd and sent their tuneful praise to heav'n  FROM Zoroastres was the song deriv'd  Who on the hills of Persia from his cave  With flow'rs incircled and with murm'ring founts  That chear'd the solemn mansion had reveal'd  How Oromasdes radiant source of good  Original immortal fram'd the globe  With all its varied beauty how with stars  By him the heav'ns were spangled how the sun  Refulgent Mithra purest spring of light  And genial warmth whence fruitful Nature smiles  Burst from the east at his creating voice  When streight beyond the golden verge of day  Night shew'd the horrours of her distant reign  Whence black and hateful Arimanius sprung  The author foul of evil he with shades  From his dire mansion veil'd the earth and skies  Or to destruction chang'd the solar beam  When parching fields deny the foodful grain  And from their channels fly th' exhaling streams  Whence pestilence and famine how the pow'r  Of Oromasdes in the human breast  Benevolence and equity infus'd  Truth temperance and wisdom sprung from heav'n  When Arimanius blacken'd all the soul  With falshood and injustice with desires  Insatiable with violence and rage  Malignity and folly If the hand  Of Oromasdes on precarious life  Shed wealth and pleasure soon th' infernal God  With wild excess or av'rice blasts the joy  Thou Oromasdes victory dost give  By thee with fame the regal head is crown'd  Great Xerxes owns thy succour When with storms  The hate of direful Arimanius swell'd  The Hellespont thou o'er the angry surge  The destin'd master of the world didst lead  This day his promis'd glories to enjoy  When Greece affrighted to his arm shall bend  Ev'n as at last shall Arimanius fall  Before thy might and evil be no more  THE Magi ceas'd their harmony when now  Before the king with adoration bow'd  Tigranes and Phraortes Prone they lay  And o'er their foreheads spread their abject hands  As from a present deity too bright  For mortal vision to conceal their eyes  At length in humble phrase Tigranes thus  O XERXES live for ever Gracious lord  Who dost permit thy servants to approach  Thy awful sight and prostrate thus to own  Thy majesty and greatness May the pow'r  Of Oromasdes stretch thy scepter'd arm  O'er all the nations from the Indian shores  Ev'n to the waters of the western main  From northern Tanais to the source of Nile  And still from thee may Arimanius turn  Against thy foes his malice to mankind  By him ev'n now with frenzy smote the Greeks  Reject thy proffer'd clemency The morn  Shall see them bleed the victims of thy wrath  HERE to his brothers turning Xerxes spake  Say Hyperanthes Does thy soul believe  These tydings Sure these slaves have never dar'd  To face the Grecians but delude our ear  With base impostures which their fears suggest  To him this answer Hyperanthes form'd  O from his servants may the king avert  His indignation Greece was fam'd of old  For martial virtue and intrepid sons  I have essay'd their valour and with me  Abrocomes can witness When our sire  The great Darius to th' Athenian shore  With Artaphernes and with Datis sent  Our tender youth at Marathon we found  How vain the hopes that numbers should dismay  A foe resolv'd on victory or death  Yet not as one contemptible or base  Let me appear before thee though the Greeks  With such unconquer'd spirits be indu'd  Soon as the king shall summon me to war  He shall behold me in the dang'rous van  Exalt my spear and pierce the hostile ranks  Or sink before them Xerxes then return'd  WHY over Asia and the Libyan soil  With all their nations does my potent arm  Extend its scepter Wherefore do I sweep  Across the globe with millions in my train  Why shade the Ocean with unnumber'd sails  Whence all this pow'r unless th' eternal will  Had doom'd to give one master to the world  And that the earth's extremity alone  Should bound my empire He for this reduc'd  Revolted Aegypt and inlarg'd my sway  With sandy Libya and the sultry clime  Of Aethiopia He for this subdu'd  The Hellespontic rage and taught the sea  Obedience to my pow'r Then cease to think  That heav'n deserting now the cause of kings  Those despicable Grecians will inspire  With courage more than human and expunge  The common fears of nature from their breasts  He ceas'd when thus Abrocomes began  THE king commands us to reveal our hearts  Then may the sun to lightning change his beams  And blast my head with ruin may the king  Look on his servant with a loathing eye  If what I here affirm be false or vain  That yonder Grecians will oppose our course  THE king arose No more prepare my Car  The Spartan exile Demaratus call  We will our selves advance and view the foe  THE monarch will'd and suddenly he hears  His trampling horses High on silver wheels  The iv'ry car with azure sapphirs shone  Caerulean beryls and the jasper green  The emerald the ruby's glowing blush  The flaming topaz with its golden beam  The pearl th' impurpled amathyst and all  The various gems which India's mines afford  To deck the pomp of kings In burnish'd gold  A sculptur'd eagle from behind displays  Its stately neck and o'er the monarch's head  Extends its dazzling wings Eight gen'rous steeds  Which on the fam'd Nysaean plain were nurs'd  In wintry Media drew the radiant car  Not those of old to Hercules refus'd  By false Laomedon nor they which bore  The son of Thetis through the scatter'd rear  Of Troy's devoted race might these surpass  In strength or beauty With obedient pride  They heard their lord exulting in the air  They toss'd their foreheads while the silver manes  Smote on their glitt'ring necks The king ascends  Beside his footstool Demaratus sat  The charioteer now shakes the golden reins  Bold Patiramphes At the signal bound  Th' attentive steeds the chariot flew behind  Ten thousand horse in thunder swept the field  The eastern bands so Xerxes had ordain'd  Between the seabeat margin and the camp  All wait imbattled all prepar'd to pass  Thermopylae To these with rapid wheels  Th' imperial car proceeds Th' approaching king  Soon through the wide battalions is proclaim'd  He now draws nigh Th' innumerable host  Roll back by nations and admit their lord  With all his satraps From his crystal dome  Rais'd on the bottom of the watry world  Thus when the potent ruler of the floods  With each caerulean deity ascends  Thron'd on his pearly chariot all the deep  Divides its bosom to th' emerging God  So Xerxes rode between the Asian world  On either side receding when as down  Th' immeasurable ranks his sight was lost  A momentary gloom o'ercast his mind  While this reflection fill'd his eyes with tears  That soon as Time an hundred years had told  Not one of all those thousands should survive  Whence to obscure thy pride arose that cloud  Was it that once humanity could touch  A tyrant's breast or rather did thy soul  Repine O Xerxes at the bitter thought  That all thy pow'r was mortal But the veil  Of sadness soon forsook his brightning eyes  As with adoring homage millions bow'd  And to his heart relentless pride recall'd  Elate the mingled prospect he surveys  Of glitt'ring files unnumber'd chariots scyth'd  On thund'ring axles roll'd with haughty steeds  In sumptuous trappings clad Barbaric pomp  Which tore with spurning hoofs the sandy beach  While ev'ry banner to the sun expands  Its gorgeous folds that beam'd with gold with shields  Tiaras helms environ'd and with spears  In number equal to the bladed grass  Whose living green in vernal beauty cloaths  Thessalia's vale What pow'rs of sounding verse  Can to the mind present th' amazing scene  Not thee whom Rumour's fabling voice delights  Poetic Fancy to my aid I call  But thou historic Truth support my song  Which shall the various multitude display  Their arms their manners and their native seats  THE Persians first in scaly corselets shone  With colours varying on the gorgeous sleeves  A gen'rous nation From their infant age  Their tongues were practic'd in the love of truth  Their limbs inur'd to ev'ry manly toil  To brace the bow to rule th' impetuous steed  And dart the javelin worthy to enjoy  The liberty their injur'd fathers lost  Whose arms for Cyrus overturn'd the strength  Of Babylon and Sardis and advanc'd  The victors head above his country's laws  Such were the Persians but untaught to form  The ranks of battle with unequal force  Against the phalanx of the Greeks they stood  And to the massy shield and weighty spear  A target light and slender lance oppos'd  On ev'ry head tiaras rose like tow'rs  Impenetrable All with burnish'd gold  Blaz'd their gay sandals and the floating reins  Of each proud courser Daggers from their thighs  A wellstor'd quiver from their shoulders hung  And strongest bows of mighty size they bore  Next with resembling arms the Medes are seen  The Cissians and Hyrcanians Media once  From her bleak mountains aw'd the subject East  Her kings in cold Ecbatana were thron'd  The Cissians march'd from Susa's regal walls  From sultry fields o'erspread with branching palms  And white with lillies water'd by the tides  Of fam'd Choaspes whose transparent waves  The golden goblet wafts to Persia's kings  No other stream the royal lip bedews  Hyrcania's race forsook their fruitful clime  Dark with the verdure of expanding oaks  To Ceres dear and Bacchus There the corn  Bent by its golden burthen sheds unreap'd  Its plenteous seed impregnating the soil  With future harvests while the bees reside  Among th' intwining branches of the groves  Where with their labours they enrich the leaves  Which flow with sweetness Next Assyria's sons  Their brazen helms display th'unskilful work  Of rude Barbarians Thickwove flax defends  Their chest and loins A buckler guards their arm  Girt with a falchion each a mace sustains  O'erlaid with iron On Euphrates' banks  In Babylon's stupendous walls they dwell  And o'er the plains where once with mightier tow'rs  Old Ninus rear'd its head th' imperial seat  Of eldest tyrants These Chaldaea joins  The land of shepherds On the pastures wide  There Belus first discern'd the various course  Of heav'n's bright planets and the clust'ring stars  With names distinguish'd whence himself was deem'd  The chief of Gods His heav'nascending fane  In Babylon the proud Assyrians rais'd  Drawn from the fertile soil which Ochus laves  The Bactrians stood like Persia's bands attir'd  Though less their javelins and their bows of cane  The Paricanians next all rough with hides  Of shaggy goats with bows and daggers arm'd  Alike in horrid garb the Caspian train  From barren mountains and the dreary coast  Which bounds the stormy lake that bears their name  With cany bows and scymetars were led  The Indians then a threefold band appear'd  Part guide the horse and part the rapid car  The rest on foot within the bending cane  For slaughter held their ironpointed reeds  These o'er the Indus from the distant floods  Of Ganges pass'd and left a region lov'd  By lavish Nature There the plenteous year  Twice crown'd with harvests smiles The honey'd shrub  The cinnamon and spikenard bless their fields  Array'd in native wealth the warriours shone  Their ears were grac'd with pendants and their hands  Incircled wore a bracelet starr'd with gems  These were the nations who to Xerxes sent  Their mingled aids of infantry and horse  NOW Muse recount what numbers yet untold  On foot obscur'd the surface of the shore  Or who in chariots or on camels beat  The loosen'd sand The Parthians first advance  Then weak in numbers o'er the Malian strand  Far from their lonely vales and woody hills  Not yet renown'd for warlike steeds they trod  With them the Sogdians Dadices arrang'd  Gandarians and Chorasmians all attir'd  Like Bactria's sons To these the Saces join  From cold Imaüs drawn from Oxus' waves  And Cyra built on Iäxartes' brink  The bound of Persia's Empire Wild untam'd  And prone to rage their desarts they forsook  A bow a falchion and a pond'rous ax  The savage legions arm'd A pointed cask  O'er each grim visage rear'd its iron cone  In arms like Persians the Saranges stood  High as the knee their buskins stretch'd and clung  Around their ham With glowing colours dy'd  Gay shone their varied garments Next are seen  The Pactyan Mycian and the Utian train  In skins of goats all horrid Bows they wield  Of springy reed with poynards at their sides  With spotted hides of leopards all array'd  Or with the spoil from tawny lions torn  In graceful range the Aethiopians stand  Of equal stature and a beauteous frame  Though scorching Phoebus had imbrown'd their face  And curl'd their crisped locks In ancient song  Renown'd for justice riches they disdain'd  As foes to virtue From their seat remote  On Nilus' verge above th' Aegyptian bound  Forc'd by their kings' malignity and pride  These friends of hospitality and peace  Themselves uninjur'd wag'd reluctant war  Against a land whose climate and whose name  To them were strange With hardest stone they point  The rapid arrow Bows of hideous length  Form'd with th'elastic branches of the palm  They bore and lances arm'd with horns of goats  And maces strong with iron Now O Muse  Recite the nations who in helmets fram'd  Of various parts and closeconnected joints  With darts and poynards shields and lances weak  A feeble train attend their tyrant's will  All victims destin'd to imbrue with gore  The Grecian spears the Paphlagonians first  From where Carambis with projected brows  O'erlooks the dusky Euxine wrapt in mists  And where through flow'rs that paint its various banks  Parthenius flows the Mariandynians next  The Matienian and the Ligyan bands  With them the Syrian multitudes who dwell  Near Daphne's grove who cultivate the glebe  Widewater'd by Orontes who along  Th' extended ridge of Libanus are nurs'd  Among the cedars or with foodful dates  Pluckt from the palms whose fruitage grac'd the plains  Around Damascus all who bear the name  Of Cappadocians swell the Syrian host  With those who gather from the fragrant shrub  The aromatic balsam and extract  Its milky juice along the lovely side  Of winding Jordan till immers'd it sleep  Beneath the pitchy surface which obscures  Th' Asphaltic lake The Phrygians then advance  To them their ancient colony is join'd  Th' Armenian bands These see the bursting springs  Of strong Euphrates cleave the yielding earth  And wide in lakes expanding hide the plain  Thence with collected waters fierce and deep  Its passage rending through diminish'd rocks  To Babylon it foams Not so the wave  Of soft Araxes to the Caspian glides  But stealing imperceptibly it laves  The fruitful herbage of Armenia's meads  Next strange to view in similar attire  Though far unlike in manners to the Greeks  Appear the Lydians Wantonness and sport  Were all their care Beside Caÿster's stream  Or smooth Maeander winding silent by  Or near Pactolus' wave among the vines  Of Tmolus rising or the wealthy tide  Of goldensanded Hermus they allure  The sight enchanted with the graceful dance  Or with melodious sweetness charm the air  And melt to softest languishment the soul  What to the battle's danger could incite  These tender sons of luxury The lash  Of their stern monarch urg'd their shiv'ring limbs  Through all the tempests which enrag'd the main  And shook beneath their trembling steps the pile  That join'd the Asian and the western worlds  To these Maeonia hot with sulph'rous mines  Unites her troops No tree adorns their fields  Unbless'd with verdure and with ashes strewn  Black are the rocks and ev'ry hill deform'd  With conflagration Helmets press'd their brows  Two darts they brandish'd Round their woolly vest  A sword was girt and hairy hides compos'd  Their bucklers round and light The Mysians left  Olympus woodenvelop'd and the soil  Wash'd by Caïcus and the baneful tide  Of Lycus nurse of serpents Targets helms  And wooden javelins harden'd in the flames  They bore By these imbattled next are seen  An ancient nation who in early times  By Trojan arms assail'd their native land  Esteem'd less dear than freedom and exchang'd  Their seat on Strymon where in Thrace it pours  Its freezing current for the distant shores  Of fishy Sangar These Bithynians nam'd  Their habitations to the sacred feet  Of Dindymus extend Yet there they groan'd  Beneath oppression and their freedom mourn'd  On Sangar now as once on Strymon lost  The ruddy skins of foxes form'd their cask  Their shields were fashion'd like the horned moon  A dart and slender poynard arm'd their hands  A vest embrac'd their bodies while abroad  Ting'd with unnumber'd hues a mantle flow'd  But other Thracians who their former name  Retain'd in Asia stood with shining helms  The horns of bulls in imitating brass  Adorn'd the lofty crest Phoenician cloth  Their legs infolds with brightest purple stain'd  And through the forest wont to chase the boar  A hunter's spear they grasp What nations still  On either side of Xerxes while he pass'd  Present their huge array and swell his soul  With more than mortal pride The num'rous train  Of Moschians and Macronians now succeed  And Mosynoecians who with berries fed  In wooden tow'rs along the Pontic shore  Repose their painted limbs the mirthful race  Of Tibarenians next whose wanton minds  Delight in sport and laughter all in casks  Of wood with shields and lances small whose points  Beyond proportion lengthen Then approach  In garments o'er their spacious bosom clasp'd  And part with javelins part with Lycian bows  A people destin'd in eternal verse  Ev'n thine sublime Maeonides to live  These are the Milyans Solymi their name  In thy celestial strains Pifidia's hills  Their dwelling Once a formidable train  They fac'd the great Bellerophon in war  Now doom'd a more tremendous foe to meet  Themselves unnerv'd with bondage and to leave  Their putrid bodies for the dogs of Greece  Next are the Marian legions furnish'd all  With shields of skins with darts and helmets wove  Of strongest texture Aria's host protend  The Bactrian lance and brace the Persian bow  Drawn from a region horrid all with thorn  One hideous waste of sands which mock the toil  Of patient culture save one favour'd spot  Which like an isle emerges from the wild  In verdure clad and interspers'd with vines  Whose gen'rous clusters yield a juice that scorns  The injuries of Time Yet Nature's hand  Had sown their rocks with coral and enrich'd  Their desert hills with veins of sapphirs blue  And those whose azure sparks of gold adorn  These from the turbant flame On ev'ry neck  The coral blushes through the num'rous throng  The Allarodians and Sasperian bands  Were arm'd with poniards like the Cholchian host  Their heads were guarded with a helm of wood  Short were their spears of hides undress'd their shields  The Cholchians march'd from Phasis and the shores  Where once Medea fair enchantress stood  And wondring view'd the first advent'rous bark  That stem'd the Pontic foam From Argo's side  The demigods descended and repair'd  To her fell sire's inhospitable walls  His blooming graces Jason there display'd  With ev'ry art of eloquence divine  He claim'd the golden fleece The virgin heard  She gaz'd with fatal ravishment and lov'd  Then to the hero she resigns her heart  Her magic tames the brazenfooted bulls  She lulls the sleepless dragon and to Greece  With faithless Jason wafts the radiant prize  The Cholchians then pursu'd their steps with war  And now with antient enmity inflam'd  Or else compell'd by Xerxes to recal  The longforgotten wrong they menace Greece  With desolation Next in Persian guise  A croud advanc'd who left the various isles  In Persia's gulph and round Arabia known  Some in their native topaz were adorn'd  From Ophiodes and Topazos sprung  And some with shells of tortoises which brood  Around Casitis' verge To them were join'd  Those who reside where Erythras intomb'd  Lies all beset with palms a pow'rful king  Who nam'd of old the Erythraean main  The Lybians next are plac'd In chariots scyth'd  They sat terrific cloath'd in skins with darts  Of wood welltemper'd in the hardning flames  Not Libya's deserts from tyrannic sway  Could hide her sons much less could freedom dwell  Amid the plenty of Arabia's fields  Where spicy cassia and the fragrant reed  And myrrh and hallow'd frankincense perfume  The zephir's wing A bow of largest size  Th' Arabians wield and o'er their lucid vest  Loose floats a mantle on their shoulder clasp'd  Of these two myriads on the lofty back  Of camels rode that match'd the swiftest horse  SUCH were the numbers which from Asia led  Bow'd down with low prostration to the wheels  Of Xerxes' chariot Yet what legions more  Expand their mighty range What banners still  The Malian sands o'ershadow Forward rolls  The regal car through nations which in arms  And order'd ranks unlike the eastern throng  Upheld the spear and buckler Yet untaught  To bend the servile knee erect they stood  Unless that mourning o'er the shameful weight  Of their new bondage some their brows depress'd  And stain'd their arms with sorrow Europe's race  Were these whom Xerxes by resistless force  Had gather'd to his standards Murm'ring here  The sons of Thrace and Macedonia stood  Here on his steed the brave Thessalian frown'd  There pin'd reluctant multitudes who bore  The name of Greeks and peopled all the coast  Between Byzantium and the Malian bay  THROUGH all the numbers which ador'd his pride  Or fear'd his pow'r the monarch now was pass'd  Nor yet among those myriads could be found  One who with Xerxes' self in tow'ring size  Or beauteous features might compare O wretch  Possess'd of all but virtue doom'd to shew  How mean without her is unbounded pow'r  The charm of beauty and the blaze of state  How insecure of happiness how vain  Thou who couldst mourn the common lot which heav'n  From none withholds which oft to thousands proves  Their only refuge from a tyrant's rage  And which by pining sickness age or pain  Becomes at last a soothing hope to all  Thou who couldst weep that Nature's gentle hand  Should lay her wearied offspring in the tomb  Yet couldst remorseless from their peaceful seats  Lead half the nations in a clime unknown  To fall the victims of thy ruthless pride  What didst thou merit from the injur'd world  What suff'rings to compensate for the tears  Of Asia's mothers for unpeopled realms  And all this waste of nature On his host  The king exulting bends his haughty sight  When thus to Demaratus he began  NOW Demaratus to thy soul recal  My father great Darius who receiv'd  Thy wandring steps expell'd their native home  Ill would it then become thee to beguile  Thy benefactors and the truth disguise  Look back on all those thousands and declare  If yonder Grecians will oppose their march  THE exile answer'd Deem not mighty lord  I will deceive thy goodness by a tale  Forg'd for their glory whose deluded minds  Perversely hearken'd to the sland'rer's tongue  Who forc'd me with unmerited disgrace  To tread the paths of banishment and woe  Nor be the king offended while I speak  The words of truth The Spartans never fly  HERE with contemptuous smiles the king return'd  Wilt thou who once wert Lacedaemon's chief  Encounter twenty Persians Yet those Greeks  With greater disproportion must confront  Our host tomorrow Demaratus thus  BY single combat were the tryal vain  And vainer still by my unworthy sword  To prove the merit of united force  Which oft by military skill surmounts  The strength of numbers Nor in fields of war  The Greeks excel by discipline alone  But from their manners Grant thy ear O king  The diff'rence learn of Grecian bands and thine  The flow'r the bulwark of thy pow'rful host  Are mercenaries These are canton'd round  Thy provinces No fertile field demands  Their painful hand to turn the fallow glebe  Them to the noonday toil no harvest calls  The stubborn oak along the mountains brow  Sinks not beneath their stroke With careful eyes  They mark not how the flocks or heifers feed  To them of wealth and all possessions void  The name of country with an empty sound  Flies o'er the ear nor warms their joyless hearts  Who share no country Needy yet with scorn  Rejecting labour wretched by their wants  Yet profligate through indolence with limbs  Soft and enervate and with minds corrupt  From misery debauchery and sloth  Are these to battle drawn against a foe  Inur'd to hardship and the child of toil  Wont through the freezing show'r and wintry storm  O'er his own glebe the tardy ox to goad  Or in the sun's impetuous heat to glow  Beneath the burthen of the yellow sheaves  Whence on himself on her whose faithful arms  Infold him joyful and a num'rous race  Which glads his dwelling plenty he bestows  With independence and when call'd to war  For these his dearest comfort and his care  And for the harvest promis'd to his toil  He lifts the shield nor shuns unequal force  Such are the pow'rs of ev'ry state in Greece  One only breeds a race more warlike still  Ev'n those who now defend that rocky pass  The sons of Lacedaemon They untaught  To break the glebe or bind the golden sheaves  To far severer labours are inur'd  Alone for war their sole delight and care  From infancy to manhood are they form'd  To want and danger to th' unwholesome ground  To winter watches and inclement skies  To plunge through torrents brave the tusky boar  To arms and wounds an exercise of pain  So fierce and constant that to them a camp  With all its hardships is the seat of rest  And war itself remission from their toils  THY words are folly scornful here replied  The Persian monarch Does not freedom dwell  Among the Grecians Therefore will they shun  Superiour foes for whosoe'er is free  Will fly from danger while the Persians know  If from th' allotted station they retreat  The scourge awaits them and my heavy wrath  CONCEIVE not Xerxes Sparta's chief return'd  The Grecians want an object where to fix  Their eyes with rev'rence and obedient dread  To them more aweful than the name of king  To Asia's trembling millions is the law  Whose sacred voice injoins them to confront  Unnumber'd foes to vanquish or to die  IN silence now the banish'd king remain'd  While near the straits the chariot roll'd it chanc'd  The Spartans then were station'd out on guard  These in gymnastic exercise employ'd  Nor heed the monarch nor his gaudy train  But toss'd the spear and whirl'd the rapid dart  Or met with adverse shields in single war  Or trooping swiftly rush'd on ev'ry side  With ranks unbroken and with equal feet  While others calm beneath their polish'd helms  Drew down their hair which hung in sable curls  And spread their necks with terrour Xerxes here  The exile questions What do these intend  Who thus with careful hands adjust their hair  TO whom the Spartan O imperial lord  Such is their custom to adorn their heads  When with determin'd valour they present  Their dauntless breasts before the jaws of death  Bring down thy myriads all in glitt'ring steel  Arm if thou canst the gen'ral race of man  All who possess the regions unexplor'd  Beyond the Ganges all whose wand'ring steps  Behind the Caspian range the Scythian wild  With those who drink the secret fount of Nile  Yet to the breasts of Sparta's sons shall fear  Be still a stranger Thus with fervour spake  The exil'd king when gushing from his eyes  Resistless grief o'erflow'd his cheek Aside  His head he turn'd and wept in copious streams  The sad remembrance of his former state  His dignity his greatness and the sight  Of those brave ranks which thus unshaken stood  And spread amazement through the world in arms  Excite those sorrows Oft with eager eyes  He views the godlike warriours who beneath  His standard once victorious fought who call'd  Him once their king and leader Then again  His head he bows with anguish and bedews  His breast with tears in agony bemoans  His faded honours his illustrious name  Forgotten now his majesty defil'd  With exile and dependence So obscur'd  By creeping ivy and by sordid moss  Some lordly palace or stupendous fane  Magnificent in ruin stands where time  Widewasting from the nodding roof hath mow'd  The column down and cleft the pond'rous dome  NOT unobserv'd by Hyperanthes mourn'd  Th' unhappy Spartan Kindly to his own  Th' exile's hand he joins and thus humane  O Demaratus this thy grief confirms  How well the Greeks deserve thy gen'rous praise  Who still repining dost their loss deplore  Though cherish'd here with universal love  But O let indignation in thy breast  Revive thy wrongs then bless th' auspicious fate  Which led thee far from calumny and fraud  To share the favour of the highest king  AS Demaratus with a grateful mind  Address'd himself to answer Persia's king  Thus interrupted Soon as morning shines  Do thou Tigranes and Phraortes head  The Medes and Saces Bring those Grecians bound  This said The monarch to his tent return'd  End of the Third Book  LEONIDAS BOOK IV  The argument  Leonidas rising by break of day commands a body of Arcadians with the Thespians and Plataeans to be drawn out for battle in that part of Thermopylae which lay under the Phocian wall from whence he harangues them The enemy approaches Diomedon kills Tigranes in single combat Both armies join battle Dithyrambus kills Phraortes The Persians entirely defeated are pursued with great slaughter by Diomedon and Dithyrambus to the extremity of the pass The Grecian commanders after the pursuit retire for refreshment to a cave in the side of mount Oeta Leonidas recals them to the camp and sends down fresh forces Diomedon and Dithyrambus with the Plataeans are permitted to continue in the field By the advice of Diomedon the Grecians advance to the broadest part of Thermopylae where they form a line of thirty in depth consisting of the Plataeans Mantinéans Tegaeans Thebans Corinthians Phliasians and Mycenaeans The attack is renew'd with great violence by Hyperanthes Abrocomes and the principal Persian leaders at the head of some chosen troops  LACONIA's leader with the morning rose  When thus to Alpheus From Arcadia's bands  Select a thousand spears To these unite  The Thespians and Plataeans Range their lines  Before the wall which fortifies the pass  There closeimbodied will their might repulse  The num'rous foe Obedient to his will  Th' appointed legions issuing from their tents  With deep'ning ranks Leonidas inclose  So round their monarch in his stormy cave  The winds assemble from his sable throne  When Aeolus sends forth his dread command  To swell the main or heav'n with clouds deform  Or bend the forest from the mountain's brow  The chief of Sparta from the rampart's height  Thus to the fight the list'ning host inflames  THIS day O Grecians countrymen and friends  Your wives your offspring your paternal seats  Your fathers country liberty and laws  Have sent you hither from your infant age  Vers'd in the various discipline of Mars  Laborious active virtuous brave and free  To match your valour with ignoble foes  In war unskilful nature's basest dross  The foes of all utility and worth  And thence a monarch's mercenary slaves  With spirits broke by servitude and want  With limbs relax'd by sloth and wanton ease  With minds debauch'd by vices uninspir'd  By all th'indearing cares in freeborn hearts  Who cold and drooping fight without a cause  To whom defeat is neither grief nor shame  Who seek no fruit from victory but spoil  These are the flow'r of Asia's host The rest  Who fill their boasted numbers are a croud  Forc'd from their dwellings to the bloody field  From whom till now with jealous care their lord  Has still withheld the instruments of war  These are the people taught with patient grief  To bear the rapine cruelty and spurns  Of Xerxes' mercenary bands and pine  In servitude to slaves With terrour sounds  The trumpet's clangor in their trembling ears  Unwonted loads the buckler and the lance  Their hands sustain incumber'd and present  The mockery of warBut ev'ry eye  Flames with impatient ardour and your breasts  Too long their swelling spirit have confin'd  Go then ye sons of Liberty and sweep  These bondmen from the field Resistless rend  The glitt'ring standard from their servile hands  Hurl to the ground their ignominious heads  The warriour's helm profaning Think the shades  Of your forefathers rear their sacred brows  Here to enjoy the glory of their sons  HE spake Loud Paeans burst from all the host  With fierce reply unnumber'd shouts ascend  From hostile nations thronging down the pass  Such is the roar of Aetna when her mouth  Displodes combustion from her sulph'rous depths  And blasts the smiles of Nature Dauntless stood  In deep array before the Phocian wall  The Greeks closewedg'd with implicated shields  And spears protended like the graceful range  Of arduous elms whose interwoven boughs  Before some rural palace wide expand  Their venerable umbrage to retard  The North's impetuous wing As o'er the main  In lucid rows the rising waves reflect  The sun's effulgence so the Grecian helms  Return'd his light which o'er their convex pour'd  And scatter'd splendour on the dancing plumes  Down rush'd the foe Exulting in the van  Their haughty leader shakes his threatning lance  And frowns defiance Bursting from his rank  Diomedon with instant fury fac'd  Th' impending foes Meantime he loudly calls  Their chief Tigranes whom he thus defies  NOW thou art met Barbarian Wouldst thou prove  Thy actions equal to thy vaunts command  Thy troops to halt while thou and I engage  TIGRANES turning to the Persians spake  My friends and soldiers check your ardent haste  While my strong lance yon Grecian's pride confounds  HE ceas'd In dreadful opposition now  Each combatant advanc'd With sinewy hand  They gripe their spears highbrandish'd Thrice they drove  With welldirected force the pointed steel  At either's throat and thrice their shields repel  The destin'd wound At length the Eastern chief  With all his pow'rs collected for the stroke  His javelin rivets in the Grecian targe  Aside Diomedon inclines and shuns  Approaching fate Then all his martial skill  Undaunted summons His forsaken lance  Beside him cast his falchion he unsheaths  The blade descending on Tigranes' arm  That instant struggling to redeem his spear  The shiv'ring hand dissevers Pale affright  Unmans the Persian while his active foe  Full on his neck discharg'd the rapid sword  And open'd wide the purple gates of life  Low sinks Tigranes in eternal shade  The conqueror bestrides the prostrate dead  Then in the clotted ringlets of the hair  His hand intwining from the bleeding trunk  The head disjoin'd and whirl'd with sudden rage  Amid the hostile numbers All with dread  Recoil where'er the ghastly visage flew  In sanguine circles and pursu'd its track  Of horrour through the air Not less amaz'd  A barb'rous nation whom the chearful dawn  Of science ne'er illumin'd view on high  A meteor waving with portentous blaze  Where oft as superstition vainly dreams  Some daemon sits amid the baneful fires  Dispersing plagues and desolation round  A while the stern Diomedon remains  Triumphant o'er the dire dismay which froze  The hearts of Persia then with haughty port  And sullen joy among his gladsome friends  Resumes his station Still the Asian bands  With consternation motionless behold  Their foes with terrour and suspend the fight  When thus Phraortes animates their breasts  HEAV'NS can one leader's death appal this host  Which counts a train of monarchs for its chiefs  Behold Phraortes from Imaüs' ridge  I draw my subject files With hardy toil  I through the pathless forest have explor'd  The tiger's cavern This unconquer'd arm  Hath from the lion rent the shaggy spoil  So through this field of slaughter will I chase  Yon vaunting Greek with ruin on his head  For great Tigranes slain His words revive  The flame of valour through the drooping van  Then on the rear he brandishes his lance  Before him shrink th' affrighted croud and roll  Their numbers headlong on the Grecian steel  With loose arrangement and uncertain feet  Thus with his trident Ocean's angry God  From its vast bottom turns the hideous mass  Of waters upward and o'erwhelms the beach  Terrific stood the fierce Plataean chief  Amid the Grecian van His ample targe  Like a strong bulwark prominent he rais'd  Before the line There thunder'd all the storm  Of darts and arrows His undaunted train  With emulating ardour charge the foe  Where'er they turn the formidable spears  Which drench'd the glebe of Marathon with gore  The Persians heap the plain Diomedon  Leads on the slaughter From his nodding crest  The sable plumes shook terrour Asia's bands  All shudder backward at the dreadful beams  Of that unconquerable sword which falls  With lightning's swiftness o'er their trembling heads  And reeking still with slain Tigranes' blood  Their shatter'd ranks o'erturns The furious chief  Incompass'd round with carnage and besmear'd  With sanguine drops inflames his warlike friends  O DITHYRAMBUS let thy deeds this day  Surmount their wonted lustre Thou in arms  Demophilus worn grey thy youth recal  Behold these slaves without resistance bleed  Advance my ancient friend Propitious Fame  Smiles on thy years and gives thy aged hand  To pluck fresh laurels for thy honour'd brow  AS when indu'd with Promethéan heat  The molten clay respir'd with sudden warmth  So glows the venerable Thespian's age  With newborn vigour ev'ry sinew swells  His falchion thund'ring on Cherasmes' helm  The forehead clove Ecbatana to war  Sent forth Cherasmes From her potent gates  He proud in hope her swarming numbers led  With Ariazus and Pencestes join'd  His martial brothers They attend his doom  By Dithyrambus foil'd Their hoary sire  Shall o'er his solitary palace roam  Lamenting loud his childless years and curse  Ambition's fury and the lust of war  Then pining bow with anguish to the grave  Next by the fierce Plataean's matchless sword  Expires Damates once the host and friend  Of fall'n Tigranes him that day he join'd  And left his native bands Of Syrian birth  In Daphne he resided near the grove  Whose hospitable laurels in their shade  Conceal'd the virgin fugitive that scorn'd  Th' embrace of Phoebus hither she repair'd  Far from her parent stream in fables feign'd  Herself a laurel to have rear'd her head  With verdant bloom in this retreat the grove  Of Daphne call'd the seat of rural bliss  Fan'd by the wing of zephirs and with rills  Of bubbling founts irriguous Syria's boast  And happy rival of Thessalia's vale  Now hid for ever from Damates' eyes  Nor with unactive spears th' Arcadians stood  Gigantic Clonius unresisted press'd  The yielding Persians who before him sunk  Crush'd like vile stubble underneath the steps  Of some glad hind who visits o'er the plain  His newshorn harvest With a fearless eye  Phraortes saw the gen'ral rout He sprung  O'er hills of carnage to confront the Greeks  Reproaching thus his own inglorious friends  FLY then ye cowards and desert your chief  Yet single here my falchion shall oppose  The might of thousands Raging thus he drove  The deathful steel through Aristander's breast  Him Dithyrambus lov'd a sacred bard  Rever'd for justice for his verse renown'd  Which sung the deeds of heroes those who fell  Or those who conquer'd in their country's cause  Th' inraptur'd soul inspiring with the thirst  Of glory won by virtue His high strain  The Muses favour'd from their neighb'ring groves  And bless'd with heav'nly melody his lyre  No more from Thespia shall his feet ascend  The shady steep of Helicon No more  The streams divine of Aganippe's fount  His tuneful lip shall moisten nor his hands  Present their off'rings in the Muses bow'r  The prostrate shield and unforsaken lance  Now feebly grasping never more to swell  His lofty numbers on the sounding string  Lo Dithyrambus weeps Amid the rage  Of war and conquest a swiftgushing tear  Finds one sad moment's interval to fall  On his pale friend But soon the victor proves  His fierce revenge Through shield and corselet plung'd  His furious javelin tore the Persian's chest  Phraortes sinks nor yet expiring sees  With indignation Persia's myriads fly  Swift through their broken legions side by side  Urg'd by the voice of Victory and Fame  Diomedon and Dithyrambus rang'd  So where Alphéus heard the rattling car  And sounding hoofs along his echoing banks  Two gen'rous coursers link'd in mutual reins  With equal speed and ardour beat the dust  To reach the glories of th' Olympic goal  THIS from his lofty chariot Xerxes saw  He saw his numbers pouring from the straits  In crouded flight then spreading o'er the field  All broke and scatter'd as a river bursts  Impetuous from its fountain then expands  Its limpid surface o'er the pastures broad  Thrice started from his seat th' astonish'd king  Shame fear and indignation rend his breast  As ruin irresistible were near  To overwhelm his millions Haste he calls  To Hyperanthes haste and meet the Greeks  Their daring rage and insolence repel  And from dishonour vindicate our name  THE godlike Hyperanthes through the tents  Obedient moves Deliberate and brave  Each active prince he summons and with care  Collects the hardiest troops Around him soon  Innumerable javelins flame His voice  Demands attention when he thus began  NOW friends divide and form two equal bands  One with the great Abrocomes with me  With Intaphernes and Hydarnes bold  With Mindus and Pandates shall advance  And snatch this shortliv'd victory from Greece  You Abradates with Pharnuchus join'd  Orontes and Mazaeus keep the rest  Imbattel'd ready to impart their aid  Shou'd envious Fate exhaust our num'rous ranks  For O great Mithra may thy radiant eye  Ne'er see us yielding to ignoble flight  The Persian fame dishonour and the praise  Of our renown'd progenitors who led  By Cyrus gave a monarch to the world  Think O ye princes flow'r of Asia's realms  What endless infamy will blast your names  Should Greece that narrow portion of the globe  Your arms defy when Babylon hath low'r'd  Its tow'ring head when Lydia's pride is quell'd  And from Ecbatana its empire torn  Think too ye warlike bands our army's boast  What deeds are ask'd from your superiour swords  You who our monarch's largest bounty share  You to whose faith and valour he commits  Himself his queens his realms and now his fame  WHILE Hyperanthes marshall'd thus his host  Far as th' extremest limit of the pass  Diomedon and Dithyrambus hung  Upon the rear of Persia Now they turn  Victorious striding o'er th' impurpled heaps  Of arms and mangled dead themselves with gore  Distain'd like two grim tigers who have forc'd  A nightly mansion on the desart rais'd  By some lonewandring traveller and dy'd  With human slaughter through the forest deep  Back to their covert's dreary gloom retire  So pass'd these heroes o'er the crimson rock  Approaching now where gasping on his shield  Phraortes lay recumbent Thespia's youth  Advancing thus his gen'rous soul express'd  LIV'ST thou brave Persian By propitious Jove  From whom the pleasing sense of mercy flows  Through mortal bosoms less my soul rejoic'd  When Fortune gave the victory before  Than now to raise thee from this field of death  THE dying prince his languid sight unclos'd  And thus with trembling lips Vain man forbear  To proffer me what soon thyself must crave  The day is now extinguish'd in these orbs  Nor shall my heart beat longer than to scorn  Thy mercy Grecian then resign to fate  HE ceas'd The great and haughty spirit fled  Demophilus drew nigh The hoary chief  Long o'er Phraortes' corse his head inclin'd  Poiz'd on his lance and thus address'd the slain  ALAS how glorious were that bleeding breast  Had Justice giv'n the buckler to thy arm  And to preserve a people bade thee die  Who now shall mourn thee Thy ungrateful king  Will soon forget thy worth For thee no tears  Among thy native countrymen shall tell  The public sorrow what to them avail'd  Thy might and dauntless spirit Not to guard  Their wives and offspring from the spoil of war  Not from their walls repel the hostile blaze  Nor desolation from their fruitful fields  But to extend oppression didst thou fall  Perhaps with inborn virtues in thy heart  Which but thy angry destiny forbade  By freedom cherish'd might have bless'd mankind  Allbounteous Nature thy impartial laws  To no selected race of men confine  The sense of glory fortitude and all  The nobler passions which inspire the mind  And render life illustrious These thou plant'st  In ev'ry soil But freedom like the sun  Must warm the gen'rous seeds By her alone  They bloom and flourish while oppression blasts  The tender virtues hence a spurious growth  False honour savage valour taint the soul  And wild ambition hence rapacious pow'r  The ravag'd earth unpeoples and the brave  A feast for dogs bestrew th' insanguin'd plain  HE said Around the venerable man  The Grecians throng'd attentive Conquest hush'd  Its joyful transports O'er the horrid field  Late the rude scene of tumult all was calm  So when the song of Thracian Orpheus drew  To Hebrus' margin from their dreary seats  The savage race which Haemus wrapt in clouds  Pangaeus cold and Rhodopeian snows  In blood and discord nurs'd the soothing strain  Flow'd with enchantment through their ravish'd ears  Their fierceness melted and amaz'd they learn'd  The sacred laws of justice which the bard  Mix'd with the musick of his heav'nly string  NOT from the field of slaughter far remote  In Oeta's rugged side had Nature clove  A rocky cavern This with moss she spread  And o'er the entrance downward from the roots  She hung the shaggy trunks of branching firrs  To heav'n's hot ray impervious From the sides  The vivid laurel spread before the sun  Its broad and glitt'ring foliage and above  The hill was darken'd with a solemn shade  Cast from the sable cypress This retreat  Cool as the grot of Thetis hid beneath  The vaulted ocean with the murm'ring sound  Of waters trickling from the riven stone  The Grecian leaders to its gloom invites  Their helms they loosen from their glowing cheeks  Against the rock their bucklers they repose  Propt on their spears they stood when Agis thus  Sent by Leonidas accosts the chiefs  O EVERWORTHY of undying names  Leonidas recals you from your toil  Which has already fill'd our mouths with praise  Our eyes with wonder that from yonder tow'r  On your unequall'd deeds incessant gaz'd  TO whom the bold Diomedon return'd  Go Agis say to Lacedaemon's king  As yet untir'd my hand can poize the spear  Nor hangs the buckler heavy on my arm  And shall I then retire And once again  Shall not the sun before he sink behold  The slaves of Xerxes tremble at my lance  TO him the Thespian youth My friend and guide  To noble actions since thy gen'rous mind  Intent on fame disdains to rest O grant  I too thy glorious labours may partake  And learn once more to imitate thy deeds  Thou gentlest Agis Sparta's chief intreat  Not to command us from the field of war  THEN interpos'd Demophilus O friend  And thou lov'd offspring of the dearest man  Who dost restore my brother to my eyes  My soul your magnanimity applauds  But O reflect that unabating toil  Subdues the mightiest Valour then will sigh  When the weak hand obeys the heart no more  Yet I declining with the weight of years  Will not assign a measure to your strength  If still you find your vigour undecay'd  Stay and augment your glory So when time  Your heads shall whiten and your feeble arms  Round the high temple's peaceful vault have hung  Their consecrated shields your native land  Shall then with honours doubled on your age  Requite the gen'rous labours of your prime  So spake the Senior and forsook the cave  NOW from the bubbling spring Diomedon  Receives the waters in his concave helm  And thus address'd the genius of the flood  WHOE'ER thou art whose deity presides  O'er this fair fountain bounteous are thy streams  Though ill shall I repay thee for again  Will I this day pollute thy silver wave  Which mix'd with gore shall tinge the Malian surge  SO saying from his brimming cask he quaff'd  The clear refreshing moisture Thus repairs  The spotted panther to Hydaspes' side  Or eastern Indus feasted with the blood  Of some torn deer which nigh his cruel grasp  Had roam'd unheeding through the secret grove  Rapacious o'er the humid brink he stoops  And in the pure and fluid crystal cools  His reeking jaws The Thespian warriour here  SEE valiant friend Leonidas hath fill'd  The pass with fresh battalions O survey  Yon line of plumed helms and glitt'ring shields  Which emulate the midday sun What joy  What ardent hope enlightens ev'ry face  O let us wait no longer lest they cry  Our wearied limbs retard us Let us arm  And take our station in the glorious van  THUS Dithyrambus The Plataean chief  Approves the counsel and resumes his arms  Them as a splendid recompense he bore  From grateful Athens when his conqu'ring sword  Her domes with great Miltiades redeem'd  From Asiatic flames Th' insculptur'd helm  Now press'd his manly temples From on high  A fourfold plumage nodded and beneath  A golden dragon with effulgent scales  The gorgeous crest illumin'd On his arm  His shield he brac'd Gorgonian serpents twin'd  Around the spacious verge Within the form  Of Pallas martial goddess was impress'd  Low as her feet the graceful tunic flow'd  Betwixt two gryffins on her helmet sat  A sphinx with wings expanded while the face  Of dire Medusa on her bosom frown'd  One hand supports her javelin which confounds  The pride of kings the other leads along  A blooming virgin Victory whose brows  A crown incircles laurels she presents  But from her shoulders all her plumes were shorn  With favour'd Athens ever now to rest  This Asia's terrour on his mighty arm  Diomedon uprear'd then snatch'd his lance  And thus to Dithyrambus Lo my friend  Alone of all the Grecians who sustain'd  The morning's battle still unwearied stand  Plataea's sons and well may keep the field  They who endur'd the Marathonian toil  Then charge with us Amid the foremost rank  Thy valour shall be plac'd and share this day  Command and honour with Plataea's chief  THE hero ceas'd and tow'rd the Grecian van  Strides with impetuous steps Nor slow behind  The boast of Thespia Dithyrambus mov'd  Like blooming Hermes in celestial arms  When lightly graceful with his feather'd feet  Along Scamander's flow'ry verge he pass'd  To aid th' incens'd divinities of Greece  Against the Phrygian tow'rs With eager speed  The heroes soon th' imbattled Greeks attain'd  To whom the brave Diomedon began  NOT to contend but vanquish are you come  And in the blood of fugitives to stain  Your lances unoppos'd My friends behold  Where furthest from the Malian gulf remov'd  The crags of Oeta less confine the straits  There let us bend extending wide our front  There with more ample scope may havoc range  ALL with assent gave ear The various bands  Move on successive The Plataeans first  Against the rock are station'd To their head  Is Dithyrambus brought Exulting joy  Distends their hearts and flashes in their eyes  Thanks to the great Diomedon they cry  Who to our troop this godlike hero joins  Hail Dithyrambus Hail illustrious chief  Well dost thou merit to have reap'd renown  At Marathon Amid the glorious front  With conscious gladness blushing on his cheek  The youth his post assumes Around him croud  The hoary warriours their unnumber'd scars  Before his sight presenting and recount  Their various dangers He their wounds surveys  With veneration nor disdains to hear  The oftrepeated tale From Sparta's king  Returning Agis here the chiefs address'd  Leonidas permits you still to brave  The hostile numbers with Plataea's band  If yet by toil unconquer'd But I see  That all unwearied ask the promis'd fight  Hail glorious veterans This signal day  May your victorious swords augment the wreaths  Around your venerable brows and make  Thermopylae like Marathon renown'd  THIS said he hastens back Meantime advanc'd  The Mantinéan Diophantus brave  And Hegesander Tegea's dauntless chief  With all their troops imbattled by their side  The Thebans form to them their native files  Alcmaeon and Eupalamus unite  Last on the margin of the Malian bay  Mycenae's youth Aristobulus drew  In one impenetrable phalanx stretch'd  Across the pass With closeconnected force  An hundred warriours form'd th' expanded ranks  And thirty bucklers ev'ry file condens'd  In strong reserve Dieneces behind  Dispos'd the Spartans and the Locrian line  There too with Maron Alpheus dauntless stood  And godlike Agis There Megistias plac'd  His blooming heir and thus his valour fires  O MENALIPPUS born of foreign race  Yet by these heroes not unworthy deem'd  With them to fight for Sparta lo the hour  Is come my son to shew thy gen'rous heart  That not with thee the buckler and the spear  Are ill intrusted to maintain a cause  So great and sacred O remember well  Leonidas on yonder bulwark stands  Who all the war contemplates and discerns  The bold and fearful O propitious heav'n  Grant me to hear Leonidas this day  Applaud my son and let Megistias die  WHILE thus he spake the animated soul  Of Menalippus struggling in his breast  Demands the fight This saw the tender sire  And thus with tears rejoin'd Remember too  Thy father sees thy danger Oh my child  To me thy honour as to thee is dear  Yet court not death By all thy filial love  By all my cares and fondness I implore  Amid the combat or the warm pursuit  Still by the wise Dieneces abide  His prudent valour knows th' unerring paths  Of glory he will guide thy youthful steps  This said to Sparta's leader he retires  NOW are the enemies descried The van  Abrocomes and Hyperanthes led  With them Pandates Intaphernes proud  Hydarnes Mindus Violent their march  With sounding footsteps swept the stony way  So where th' unequal globe in mountains swells  A river pours its thund'ring surge between  The steeperected cliffs tumultuous roll  The torrents bursting o'er the pointed crags  The mountains roar the marble channel foams  With obvious arms th' intrepid Greeks withstand  The dire encounter Soon th' impetuous shock  Of thousands and of myriads shakes the ground  Stupendous scene of terrour Under hills  Whose nodding summits vaulted o'er their heads  In unextinguishable fury join'd  The dreadful conflict With inverted trunks  Obliquely bending from the shagged ridge  The sylvan horrours overshade the fight  The shrillmouth'd trumpet and the deeptun'd horn  Mix'd with the crash of intermingling spears  The clanging shields and war's discordant shouts  Awake the echoes through the neighb'ring groves  And rocks and shores return the hideous sound  End of the Fourth Book  LEONIDAS BOOK V  The argument  Hyperanthes discontinuing the fight while he waits for reinforcements Teribazus a Persian remarkable for his merit and learning and highly belov'd by Hyperanthes but unhappy in his passion for Ariana a daughter of Darius advances from the rest of the army to the rescue of a friend in distress who lay wounded on the field of battle Teribazus is attack'd by Diophantus the Mantinéan whom he overcomes then engaging with Dithyrambus is himself slain Hyperanthes hastens to his succour A general battle ensues Hyperanthes and Abrocomes partly by their own valour and partly by the perfidy of the Thebans who desert the line being on the point of forcing the Grecians are repuls'd by the Lacedaemonians Hyperanthes composes a select body out of the Persian standing forces and making an improvement in their discipline renews the attack upon which Leonidas changes the disposition of his army Hyperanthes and the ablest Persian generals are driven out of the field and several thousands of the Barbarians circumvented in the pass are entirely destroy'd  AMID the van of Persia was a youth  Nam'd Teribazus not for golden stores  Not for wide pastures travers'd o'er with herds  With bleating thousands or with bounding steeds  Nor yet for pow'r nor splendid honours fam'd  Rich was his mind in ev'ry art divine  And through the paths of science had he walk'd  The votary of wisdom In the years  When tender down invests the ruddy cheek  He with the Magi turn'd the hallow'd page  Of Zoroastres then his tow'ring soul  High on the plumes of contemplation soar'd  And from the lofty Babylonian fane  With learn'd Chaldaeans trac'd the mystic sphere  There number'd o'er the vivid fires that gleam  Upon the dusky bosom of the night  Nor on the sands of Ganges were unheard  The Indian sages from sequester'd bow'rs  While as attention wonder'd they disclos'd  The pow'rs of nature whether in the woods  The fruitful glebe or flow'r or healing plant  The limpid waters or the ambient air  Or in the purer element of fire  The fertile plains where great Sesostris reign'd  Mysterious Aegypt next the youth survey'd  From Elephantis where impetuous Nile  Precipitates his waters to the sea  Which far below receives the sev'nfold stream  Thence o'er th' Ionic coast he stray'd nor pass'd  Milétus by which once inraptur'd heard  The tongue of Thales nor Priene's walls  Where Wisdom dwelt with Bias nor the seat  Of Pittacus along the Lesbian shore  Here too melodious numbers charm'd his ear  Which flow'd from Orpheus and Musaeus old  And thee O father of immortal verse  Maeonides whose strains through ev'ry age  Time with his own eternal lip shall sing  Back to his native Susa then he turn'd  His wandring steps His merit soon was dear  To Hyperanthes generous and good  And Ariana from Darius sprung  With Hyperanthes of th' imperial race  Which rul'd th' extent of Asia in disdain  Of all her greatness oft an humble ear  To him would bend and listen to his voice  Her charms her mind her virtue he explor'd  Admiring Soon was admiration chang'd  To love nor lov'd he sooner than despair'd  But unreveal'd and silent was his pain  Nor yet in solitary shades he roam'd  Nor shun'd resort but o'er his sorrows cast  A sickly dawn of gladness and in smiles  Conceal'd his anguish while the secret flame  Rag'd in his bosom and its peace consum'd  His heart still brooding o'er these mournful thoughts  CAN I O wisdom seek relief from thee  Who dost approve my passion From the pow'r  Of beauty only thou wouldst guard my heart  But here thyself art charm'd where softness grace  And ev'ry virtue dignify desire  Yet thus to love despairing is to prove  The sharpest sorrow which relentless Fate  Can from her store of woes inflict on life  But dost not thou this moment warn my soul  To fly the fatal charmer Do I pause  Back to the wise Chaldaeans will I go  Or wander on the Ganges where to heav'n  With thee my elevated soul shall tow'r  With thee the secrets of the earth unveil  There no tumultuous passion shall molest  My tranquil hours and ev'ry thought be calm  O wretched Teribazus all conspires  Against thy peace Our mighty lord prepares  To overwhelm the Grecians Ev'ry youth  Attends the war and I who late have poiz'd  With no inglorious arm the soldier's lance  And near the side of Hyperanthes fought  Must join the throng How therefore can I fly  From Ariana who with Asia's queens  The splendid camp of Xerxes will adorn  Then be it so Again I will adore  Her gentle virtue Her delightful tongue  Her graceful sweetness shall again diffuse  Resistless magic through my ravish'd heart  And thus when love with double rage inflam'd  Swells to distraction in my tortur'd breast  ThenBut in vain through darkness do I search  My fate despair and fortune be my guides  THE hour arriv'd when Xerxes first advanc'd  His arms from Susa's gates The Persian dames  So were accustom'd all the eastern fair  In sumptuous cars accompanied his march  And Ariana grac'd the beauteous train  From morn till ev'ning Teribazus guards  Her passing wheels his arm her weight sustains  With trembling pleasure often as she mounts  Th' imperial chariot his assiduous hand  From each pure fountain wafts the living flood  Nor seldom by the fairone's soft command  Would he repose him at her feet reclin'd  While o'er his lips her lovely forehead bow'd  Won with his grateful eloquence that sooth'd  With sweet variety the tedious march  Beguiling time He too would then forget  His cares awhile in raptures vain intranc'd  Delusion all and fleeting rays of joy  Soon overcast with more intense despair  Like wintry clouds which op'ning for a time  Tinge their black skirts with scatter'd beams of day  Then swiftly closing on the brows of Morn  Condense their horrours and in thickest gloom  The ruddy beauty veil Such woes oppress'd  The Persian's heart not soften'd for this day  His daring valour from the bleeding van  Oppos'd the frown of adamantine Mars  With no tiara were his temples bound  The slender lance of Asia he disdain'd  And her light target Eminent he mov'd  In Grecian arms the wonder of his foes  Among th' Ionians had his strenuous limbs  In war been practic'd A resplendent cask  Flam'd on his head Before his face and chest  Down to the knees his ample shield was spread  A pond'rous ash with skillful hands he grasp'd  Thus arm'd tremendous in the front he stood  Beneath his might two bold Phliasians died  And three Tegeans whose indignant chief  Brave Hegesander vengeance breath'd in vain  With streaming wounds repuls'd Thus far unmatch'd  His strength prevail'd when Hyperanthes' voice  Recall'd his fainting legions Now each band  Their languid courage reinforc'd with rest  Meantime with Teribazus thus confer'd  The godlike prince Thou muchdeserving youth  O had thy deeds with emulation warm'd  The frozen hearts of Persia Greece had wept  Her prostrate ranks not triumph'd in our shame  Relaxing now the wearied fight I wait  Till from the camp with Abradates strong  The brave Pharnuchus and Mazaeus move  And with fresh pow'rs renew the drooping war  For since surpass'd in valour we must waste  By endless numbers and continual toil  The matchless ardour of our gallant foes  HE said Immers'd in sadness scarce replied  But to himself thus plain'd the am'rous youth  STILL do I languish mourning o'er the fame  My arm acquires O wretched heart thou seat  Of constant sorrow what deceitful smiles  Yet canst thou borrow from illusive hope  To flatter life At Ariana's feet  What if with supplicating knees I bow'd  Implor'd her pity and reveal'd my love  Wretch canst thou climb to yon effulgent orb  And share the splendours which irradiate heav'n  Dost thou aspire to that exalted maid  Great Xerxes' sister rivalling the hopes  Of Asia's purpled potentates and kings  Unless within her bosom I inspir'd  A passion fervent as my own nay more  Such as might dissipate each virgin fear  And unrestrain'd disclose its fond desire  My hopes are fruitless Plung'd in black despair  He thus revolv'd when suddenly the cries  Of Aribaeus smote his pensive ear  By mutual danger and by friendship join'd  They had been long companions in the toils  Of war Together with victorious steps  The sons of Nile they chas'd when Aegypt's pride  Before the arms of Hyperanthes fell  Stretch'd on the plain and cover'd o'er with wounds  By all abandon'd Teribazus views  His gallant friend His languid soul awakes  And forth he issues from the Persian line  The bleeding warriour in his strong embrace  Swift he conveys By indignation fir'd  Fierce from the Grecians Diophantus rush'd  With loud defiance Teribazus leaves  His rescu'd friend His massy targe he rears  Advances high his formidable spear  And turns intrepid on th' approaching foe  Amazement follow'd On he strode and shook  The plumed honours of his shining crest  Th' illfated Greek awaits th' unequal fight  Pierc'd in the throat with sounding arms he falls  Through ev'ry band the Mantinéans mourn  Upon the slain the victor fix'd his sight  And thus reflected By thy splendid arms  Thou art a Greek of no ignoble rank  And from thy fall perhaps am I adorn'd  With more conspicuous lustre What if heav'n  Should add new victims like thyself to grace  My undeserving hand who knows but she  Might smile upon my trophies Oh vain thought  Disperse ye fantome hopes Too long my heart  Hast thou in vain contended with thy woes  I stand this moment on the verge of life  By fame invited by despair impell'd  To pass th' irremeable bound No more  Shall Teribazus backward turn his steps  But here decide his fate Then beat no more  Thou troubled heart and ev'ry grief be still  Now at th' approach of everlasting peace  HE ended when a mighty foe drew nigh  Not less than Dithyrambus E'er they join'd  The Persian thus the Thespian youth address'd  SAY art not thou th' unconquerable Greek  Whose dauntless valour mow'd our battle down  And scatter'd nations To attempt thy force  This day I purpos'd when our chiefs from fight  Their host withdrew That now my single arm  Thou deign'st to meet receive my thanks and know  The thought of conquest less employs my mind  Than that by thee I cannot fall with shame  HE ceas'd These words the Thespian chief return'd  Of all the praises from thy gen'rous mouth  The only share which justice bids me claim  Is that I here adventure to confront  Thy matchless strength Believe not that unmark'd  Were thy great deeds From you unbounded camp  None yet hath equall'd thy victorious hand  But whence thy armour of the Grecian form  Whence thy tall spear thy helmet whence the weight  Of that strong shield unlike thy eastern friends  O if thou be'st some fugitive who lost  To liberty and virtue art become  A tyrant's vile stipendiary with grief  That valour thus triumphant I behold  Which after all its danger and brave toil  Deserves no honour from the Gods or men  HERE Teribazus with a sigh return'd  I am to Greece a stranger and a wretch  To thee unknown who seek this hour to die  Though not ignobly but in death to raise  My name from darkness while I end my woes  THE Grecian then I view thee and I mourn  A dignity which virtue only bears  And resolution on thy brow enthron'd  Though grief hath dim'd thy drooping eye demand  My veneration and whatever be  The malice of thy fortune what the cares  Which thus infest thy quiet they create  Within my breast the pity of a friend  Why hast thou then compell'd me to oppose  My arm against thee while thy might supports  Th' unjust ambition of malignant kings  The foes to virtue liberty and peace  Yet free from rage or enmity I lift  My adverse javelin Victory I ask  Thy life may fate for happier hours reserve  THIS said their beaming lances they protend  Of hostile hate or fury both devoid  As on the Isthmian or Olympic sand  For fame alone contending Either host  Pois'd on their spears in silent wonder gaz'd  The fight begins when soon the Grecian lance  Which all the day in constant battle worn  Unnumber'd shields and corselets had transfix'd  Against the Persian target shiv'ring breaks  Its master's hand disarming Then began▪  The sense of honour and the dread of shame  To swell in Dithyrambus Undismay'd  He grapples with the foe and instant seiz'd  The threatning javelin e'er th'uplifted arm  Could execute the meditated wound  The weapon burst betwixt their struggling hands  They loose their grasp and bare their shining swords  With equal swiftness to defend or charge  Each active youth advances or recedes  On ev'ry side they traverse now direct  Obliquely now the wheeling blades descend  Still is the conflict dubious when the Greek  Dissembling points his falchion to the earth  His arm depress'd as overcome with toil  While with his buckler cautious he repels  The blows repeated from th' exulting foe  Greece trembles for her hero Joy pervades  The Asian ranks and Hyperanthes strides  Before the line preparing to receive  His friend triumphant Teribazus now  Press'd with redoubled efforts Still the Greek  Sustains th' assault defensive and at last  As with unguarded fury of his strokes  Th' unwary Persian sideways swung his targe  The fatal moment Dithyrambus watch'd  And darting forward with his feet outstretch'd  His falchion buries in th' obnoxious side  Affection grief and terrour wing the speed  Of Hyperanthes From his bleeding foe  The Greek retires not distant and awaits  The eastern prince But he with wat'ry cheeks  And dumb with sorrow clasps his dying friend  From whose cold lip with interrupted phrase  These accents broke O dearest best of men  My heart is fruitful with ten thousand thoughts  Of gratitude and love to thee but fate  Denies my voice the utt'rance O my friend  O Hyperanthes hear my tongue unfold  What thou shouldst ne'er have known before this hour  When as I open all my secret soul  I may at once retire and veil my eyes  In endless night nor thou presumption deem  What with my dying breath I here divulge  I love thy sister With despair I lov'd  And thence perhaps untimely is my date  Though witness heav'n without regret I bleed  With honour thus in Persia's sight and thine  HE ceas'd th' inexorable hand of Fate  Weigh'd down his eyelids and the gloom of death  His fleeting sight eternally o'ershades  Him on Choaspes o'er the blooming verge  His frantic mother shall bewail and strew  Her silver tresses in the crystal tide  While all the shore reechoes to the name  Of Teribazus lost Th' afflicted prince  The pallid corse contemplating with tears  Thus in the bitterness of grief exclaims  OH Teribazus Oh my friend whose loss  I will deplore for ever Oh what pow'r  To me and thee averse thus clos'd thy breast  To Hyperanthes with distrust unkind  She should she must have lov'd thee Now no more  Thy friendly aspect shall delight my eyes  While in remembrance thy unequall'd worth  Will live for ever to remind my grief  Of what I lost O Susa if again  Thee I revisit from this hostile land  Far from the clamours of tumultuous war  Then shall my hours be vacant to complaint  Whole years shalt thou be witness while I mourn  And Ariana shall assist my woes  Let fiercest vengeance now possess my soul  HE said and ardent rushes on the Greek  Who while his noble enemy expir'd  And Hyperanthes snatch'd with tender arms  The last embraces from his gasping friend  Stood near reclin'd in sadness o'er his shield  And in the pride of victory repin'd  Nor mark'd his threatning foe when swift approach'd  Diomedon Before the Thespian youth  Aloft he rais'd his targe and loudly thus  HOLD thee Barbarian from a life more worth  Than thee and Xerxes with his host of slaves  HIS words he seconds with his rapid lance  Soon a tremendous conflict had ensu'd  But Intaphernes Mindus and the half  Of Persia's leaders anxious for the life  Of Hyperanthes pour'd with all their bands  Betwixt th' encountring chiefs With mutual wrath  They strove in vain the combat to renew  So rage two bulls upon th' opposing banks  Of some deep flood which parts the fruitful mead  Defiance thunders from their angry mouths  In vain in vain the furrow'd earth they rend  Wide rolls the stream and intercepts the war  The fierce Plataean satiates his revenge  On vulgar lives Before his dreaded arm  Whole ranks are scatter'd But the Persian prince  Borne down the stress of battle gains the shore  Where then the brave Abrocomes advanc'd  With him Orontes and Pharnuchus stood  Mazaeus Abradates fam'd in arms  And all the boldest of the eastern chiefs  Begirt with fresh battalions here with speed  Abrocomes his brother thus bespake  TO Intaphernes is Pandates sent  With charge to harrass in perpetual fight  The Grecians next the mountains Thou with me  And these unite thy valour Here the flow'r  Of all our army is together drawn  Here all the weight of battle will impend  He said The godlike Hyperanthes seeks  The dang'rous van He heads the splendid throng  Of satraps princes and imperial pow'rs  Themselves the lords of nations who before  The throne of Xerxes tributary bow'd  Now mix'd the war Th' inverted javelins gleam  From ev'ry part and fell Bellona roars  WHO first distain'd with Persian blood his sword  Eupalamus Artembares he slew  And Derdas fierce whom Caucasus had rear'd  On its tempestuous brow the savage sons  Of violence and rapine but their doom  Great Hyperanthes marks his angry lance  Arrests the victor in his haughty course  Beneath the strong Abrocomes o'erwhelm'd  Melissus swells the number of the dead  None could Mycenae boast of prouder birth  Than young Melissus blooming as the son  Of Maia all in radiant arms he grac'd  The front of battle he in Cirrha's vale  Where high Parnassus from its double top  O'ershades the Pythian games the envied prize  Of fame obtain'd low sinks his laurell'd head  In death's cold night and horrid gore deforms  His graceful locks Impatient for revenge  Aristobulus strides before the van  A storm of fury darkens all his brow  Around he rolls his gloomy eye and marks  Achaemenes for death of regal blood  Deriv'd from Croesus once th' imperial lord  Of nations him the nymphs of Halys wept  When with delusive oracles beguil'd  By Delphi's God he pass'd their fatal waves  A mighty empire to dissolve nor knew  Th' illdestin'd king that envious Fortune watch'd  That dreadful moment from his hand to wrest  The scepter of his fathers In the shade  Of humble life his race on Tmolus' brow  Lay hid 'till rous'd to battle here his breath  Achaemenes resigns Then Lycis bled  For horrid war illchosen He was skill'd  To tune the lulling flute and melt the heart  Or with his pipe's awak'ning strains invite  The lovely dames of Lydia to the dance  They graceful o'er the verdant level mov'd  In varied measures while the cooling breeze  Beneath their swelling garments wanton'd o'er  Their snowy breasts and smooth Cayster's wave  Softgliding murmur'd by His op'ning chest  Pours forth his entrails and supine he falls  Not long the Grecian triumphs From the slain  In all the pride of conquest as he rends  His reeking javelin Hyperanthes' steel  His knee invades and bursts the sinewy cords  The Mycenaeans with uplifted shields  Corinthians and Phliasians gather round  The wounded Grecian With redoubled rage  The conflict glows Abrocomes incites  Each Persian leader all obey his voice  Here Abradates there Mazaeus press'd  Orontes and Hydarnes none retire  From toil or peril urg'd on ev'ry side  The Greeks at length th' abandon'd chief resign  Despairing raging destitute he stands  Propt on his spear his wound forbids retreat  None but his brother Eumenes abide  The dire extremity His shield defends  The fainting chief till Hyperanthes' sword  Full on his arm its dreadful weight discharg'd  Down with the buckler drops the sever'd hand  Nor quits its grasp Now sink the wretched pair  Beneath the Persian's unresisted steel  From both their breasts the vital currents flow  And mix their streams Elate the Persians roll  Their deepning legions on the foes dismay'd  The Greeks their station painfully maintain  This soon the faithless Anaxander saw  When thus to Leontiades he spake  THIS is the time to aid our Persian friends  Behold the Greeks are press'd Let Thebes retire  And yield a bloodless conquest to the king  THE Thebans streight desert the broken line  Not with unpunish'd treachery the spears  Of fierce Orontes and Pharnuchus join'd  With Mindus gor'd their shameful flight and thin'd  Their bleeding files Meantime as he who rul'd  Than Jove more antient on the throne of heav'n  When from the womb of Chaos dark the world  Emerg'd to birth where'er he view'd the jar  Of atoms yet discordant and unform'd  Confusion thence with pow'rful voice dispell'd  Till light and order universal reign'd  So from the wall Leonidas explor'd  The various war He saw the Theban rout  That Corinth Phlius and Mycenae look'd  Affrighted backward instantly he charg'd  The sons of Lacedaemon to repair  The disunited phalanx E'er they move  Dieneces inspires them Fame my friends  Calls forth your valour in a signal hour  For you this glorious period she reserv'd  To vindicate the Spartan name He spake  On either side supported by the might  Of Agis and of Alpheus he conducts  His gen'rous troop who riveting their shields  In dense array indissolubly firm  Confront the Persians and with death repulse  Their scatter'd numbers when with efforts vain  They oft renew'd the contest and recoil'd  As oft confounded with diminish'd ranks  Thus Hyperanthes counsell'd Learn O chiefs  From whence alone success can grace our arms  These are a band selected from the Greeks  Unlike the others whom we lately chas'd  Perhaps the Spartans whom we oft have heard  By Demaratus prais'd To break their line  False is the hope while unarray'd and lax  And wanting union singly we assail  Their strength collected Do not we preside  O'er Asia's myriads and our valour boast  And martial arts above the vulgar herd  Let us ye chiefs attempt in order'd ranks  To join our force and emulate the foe  THEY wait not dubious Soon a dreadful line  From Oeta's mountain to the shore extends  Compos'd of all the leaders Mindus bold  Pharnuchus and Mazaeus and the strength  Of fierce Abrocomes with each who bore  The highest honours and excell'd in war  To these succeed a chosen number drawn  From those whom Asia boasts her bravest sons  Who from their king perpetual stipends share  And station'd round his provinces by arms  His tyranny sustain In ev'ry part  Is Hyperanthes seen with active care  To form the huge battalion Soon they stand  In just array when cautious lest their march  Might still relax their order Persia's prince  Amid the center of the foremost rank  Orontes plac'd committing to his hand  Th' imperial standard whose expanded folds  Glow'd in the air presenting to the sun  The richest dye of Tyre the royal bird  Amid the gorgeous tincture shone exprest  In flaming gold On this the eastern chief  Commands each Persian station'd in the front  To turn his eyes regardful and to guide  His slow and equal feet by this alone  Retiring or advancing Next he charg'd  That ev'ry warriour through the num'rous files  Observing none but those before him rang'd  Should watch their motions and their steps pursue  Close by the standard then th' intrepid chief  His post assumes and animates the band  ILLUSTRIOUS warriours whose unconquer'd arms  Rebellious Aegypt and the Libyan felt  Think what the splendour of your former deeds  From you demands remember from the great  Heroic actions are a debt to fame  No middle course remains for them to tread  Whom she hath once ennobled and this hour  Or with fresh trophies will enlarge your praise  Or will for ever with dishonour blast  THE hero said and all to fight proceed  As when tempestuous Eurus stems the weight  Of western Neptune struggling through the straits  Which bound Alcides' labours here the storm  With rapid wing reverberates the tide  There the contending surge with furrow'd tops  To mountains swells and whelming o'er the beach  On either coast invests with hoary foam  The Mauritanian and Iberian strand  Not with less rage in hideous onset meet  The Grecians and Barbarians These preserve  Their formost ranks unbroken where was drawn  The prime of Asia's warriours and the croud  Though still promiscuous pouring from behind  Yet added pressure to th' imbattled chiefs  With endless numbers Like the mural strength  Of some proud city bulwark'd round and arm'd  With rising tow'rs to guard her wealthy stores  Immoveable impenetrable stood  The serried phalanx of the Greeks Behind  Their country spread their fields with plenty crown'd  Their native walls and habitations lay  With each dear pledge of friendship and of love  High in the Persian van th' exalted lance  Of Hyperanthes flam'd Beside him press'd  Abrocomes Hydarnes and the bulk  Of Abradates terrible in war  And here the great Dieneces upheld  His shield's expanded surface and alone  Firm as a Memphian pyramid sustain'd  The stress of thousands Alpheus here unmov'd  And Agis there connect their spacious orbs  With Menalippus wise Megisthias' heir  In one impervious line Long time the hosts  Maintain in strong and unrelax'd array  The conflict undecided nor could Greece  Repel the adverse numbers nor the force  Of Asia's myriads could remove the Greeks  BUT now from Sparta's king who soon discern'd  The Persian's new arrangement Medon hastes  Th' illustrious chief of Locris from the race  Of Ajax sprung in Trojan fields renown'd  To wife Dieneces he thus began  LEONIDAS commands the Grecian line  To yield before the Persians and with speed  To measure back some paces Soon he deems  The unexperienc'd foe in wild pursuit  Will break their order Then the charge renew  Let Agis join'd with Alpheus from the line  Rush with Laconia's troop imbattled deep  And force a passage through the Barb'rous host  Thou with a strong battalion from the sons  Of Locris drawn must follow swift and reach  The Spartans led by Agis with the rest  Of Locris' youth shall I advance to fill  Your vacant station and the line maintain  While in the narrow entrance where the pass  Looks o'er the Malian plain on Persia's camp  Do thou arrange to intercept the foe  Should Asia pour fresh succours from her tents  Then Xerxes soon the slaughter shall deplore  Of all these thousands in the straits inclos'd  For sure destruction and the Gods of Greece  Behold their temples with profusion grac'd  Of splendid off'rings from Barbarian spoils  Won by their freeborn supplicants this day  THIS heard Dieneces obedient gave  Through ev'ry band the signal of retreat  When all at once drew backward Persia stop'd  As with amazement rooted to the earth  At unexpected conquest 'till the voice  Of fierce Abrocomes their minds awakes  With these triumphant accents By the sun  They fly before us My victorious friends  Delay you then to enter Greece Away  Rush on undaunted I already hear  Our horse and chariots thund'ring o'er their plains  And view their towns involv'd in Persian fires  HE said With hurried violence they roll  Tumultuous forward All with headlong pace  Wide from their ranks expatiate in pursuit  Disjoin their order and the line dissolve  This when the sage Dieneces descries  The Grecians halt returning to the charge  With sudden onset In a moment pierc'd  By Lacedaemon's chief Orontes falls  And quits th' imperial banner this the Greek  In triumph waves and gives the dreadful sign  At once with Agis tow'ring in the front  And rapid Alpheus all Laconia's band  In deep arrangement bursting from the line  Bear down with irresistible career  The eastern legions shatter'd and o'erturn'd  With all their standards trampled on the plain  As the swift vessel when a rising gale  Distends the canvass its resistless course  Impells through millions of opposing waves  Through the Barbarian multitudes so pierc'd  The Spartan wedge Invincible o'er hills  Of arms and mangled corses they impress  Their crimson footsteps Persia's bravest chiefs  Ev'n Hyperanthes from the line is driv'n  And flying thousands through the pass are swept  Before the Spartans With a Locrian troop  Of hideous depth Dieneces pursues  His conqu'ring friends and hews his purple way  Through Asia's numbers which again were clos'd  In vain himself unconquerable leads  Destruction on and heaps the rock with death  But on the broken foe what ruin falls  From Alpheus' sword O'er all in swift pursuit  Was he renown'd His rapid feet had match'd  The son of Peleus in the dusty course  Or had he run for Atalanta's love  He had rejected Cytheraea's aid  Nor of her swiftness to beguile the fair  Before her steps had thrown the golden balls  But now the wrongs the longremember'd wrongs  Of Polydorus animate his strength  With tenfold vigour guided by revenge  His falchion reddens with Barbarian blood  The gory drops besprinkled all his shield  Like crimson poppies o'er the yellow plain  As when with horrour wing'd a whirlwind rends  A shatter'd navy from the ocean cast  Th' enormous fragments hide the sandy beach  Thus o'er the rock the Persians lay bestrewn  By Alpheus raging in the swift pursuit  Not with severer pangs the God of day  The Theban queen afflicted when incens'd  With her proud vaunts he hurl'd her blooming race  From youth and beauty to the pale abodes  Than now distracted Hyperanthes' soul  As round him bleeding by the Spartan's lance  His noblest friends lay gasping Oft he strove  To turn his flying legions oft the fight  With Abradates and his brother's force  Renews against insuperable foes  In vain repugnant till by all around  Deserted mixing with the gen'ral rout  He yields to fortune and the field forsakes  So with relapsing waves the ebbing tide  Beats for a time against the shelving strand  Still by degrees retiring and at last  Within the bosom of the main subsides  NOW at Thermopylae's extremest bound  The Spartans check'd their progress Soon approach'd  Dieneces and thus began Behold  What numbers have we pass'd of Perfia's sons  Be swift my friends and form He said and fill'd  The narrow straits with order'd files a depth  Of fifty warriours half on Asia's host  Half tow'rd the pass were turn'd a double front  Where ev'ry rank with twenty javelins flam'd  The Locrian band to Agis is assign'd  Who stands prepar'd to stop the flying foes  Dieneces himself to Persia's camp  Presents the terrours of the Spartan steel  NOW Muse the wond'rous stratagem display  Which Sparta's hero whose presiding care  Mark'd all the great vicissitudes of fight  And rul'd the course of slaughter had conceiv'd  To whelm the num'rous longresisting foe  In hideous death and signalize the day  With horrours new to war As o'er the wall  His constant station darting through the straits  His watchful eye e'er yet the battle clos'd  He view'd the hostile myriads swarming down  And nations still succeeding from the camp  Immense exhaustless by an horrid length  Of clust'ring helms and shields and threatning spears  Join'd to the Grecian van the wary chief  Lest by the longprotracted fight his Greeks  Might yield o'erlabour'd from the Locrians chose  A thousand warriours These by Maron led  Ascend the mountain which o'erhung the pass  His charge he soon reveals A thousand hands  At once with restless pains assemble stones  Of hugest bulk and wither'd trunks uptorn  In elder times by whirlwinds from the grove  Unwearied then they loosen from the rocks  Broad craggy fragments from the mountain hew'd  Its venerable firs and aged oaks  Of wide circumference and knotted strength  Which of their branches by the lightning bared  Presented still against its blasting flame  Their hoary pride unshaken These the Greeks  Roll heavy on with massy leavers heave  Or drag with strongknit cables till they reach  Where o'er the Persian multitudes inclin'd  The mountain's edge so lofty that the voice  Of war below there lost its deafning roar  And soften'd into murmurs Still his post  Though Hyperanthes from the field was driv'n  With thronging numbers Intaphernes bold  Beneath the shade of this incumbent hill  Against the fierce Diomedon maintain'd  Great Intaphernes progeny of kings  Whom o'er Damascus and the Syrian palms  Had Xerxes seated with despotic sway  His substitute This Maron from on high  Surveys and gives the signal downward sinks  The nodding pile stupendous heap of death  Trees roll'd on trees with mingled rock descend  Unintermitted ruin Loud resound  The hollow trunks against the mountain's side  Swift bounds each craggy mass The foes beneath  Look up aghast with horrour shrink and die  Whole legions crush'd beneath the dreadful heaps  Lie hid and lost as never they had known  A name or being while around them grew  A hill of ruin Numbers still survive  Who shun destruction with impetuous flight  But Agis stops them Intaphernes falls  Before his thund'ring arm Again they turn  To meet resistless ruin From behind  With twice two hundred Locrians Agis pours  MEANTIME the Grecian line so Sparta's king  Decreed had left its station and beyond  The heaps of dreadful carnage was advanc'd  There stretch'd from Oeta to the Malian bay  The Locrians led by Medon had dispos'd  With Corinth Phlius and Mycenae's train  Their hostile phalanx o'er the less'ning pass  Along the mountain's side Plataea's troop  The Mantinéans and Tegaeans stood  An horrid length of war Th' unwearied swords  Of Dithyrambus and Diomedon  Still blaz'd the terrour of the Barb'rous host  Before them fled the Persians to the shore  All in a moment by the various bands  Of Greece surrounded From the gulph profound  Perdition here inevitable frowns  And there incircled by a grove of spears  They stand devoted hecatombs to Mars  Now not a moment's interval delays  Their gen'ral doom but down the Malian steep  Prone are they hurried to th' expanded arms  Of Horrour rising from the op'ning deep  And grasping all their numbers as they fall  The dire confusion like a storm invades  The chafing billows loud resounds the shore  And o'er whole troops by fell Bellona roll'd  In one vast ruin from the craggy ridge  O'er all their arms and ensigns deep ingulph'd  With hideous roar the surge for ever clos'd  End of the Fifth Book  LEONIDAS BOOK VI  The argument  Night coming on the Grecians retire to their tents A guard is plac'd on the Phocian wall under the command of Agis He admits into the camp a lady accompanied by a single slave and conducts them to Leonidas when she discovers herself to be Ariana sister of Xerxes and Hyperanthes and sues for the body of Teribazus which being found among the slain she kills herself upon it The slave who attended her proves to be Polydorus brother of Alpheus and Maron and who had been formerly carried into captivity by a Phoenician pirate He relates before an assembly of the chiefs a message from Demaratus to the Spartans which discloses the treachery of the Thebans and of Epialtes the Malian who had undertaken to lead part of the Persian army through a pass among the mountains of Oeta This information throws the council into a great tumult which is pacified by Leonidas who sends Alpheus to observe the motions of these Persians and Dieneces with a party of Lacedaemonians to support the Phocians with whom the defence of these passages in the hills had been intrusted In the mean time Agis sends the bodies of Teribazus and Ariana to the camp of Xerxes  IN sable pomp with all her starry train  The night assum'd her throne Recall'd from war  Her longprotracted labours Greece forgets  Dissolv'd in silent slumber all but those  Who watch'd th' uncertain perils of the dark  An hundred warriours Agis was their chief  High on the wall intent the hero sat  As o'er the surface of the tranquil main  Along its undulating breast the wind  The various din of Asia's host convey'd  In one deep murmur swelling in his ear  When by the sound of footsteps down the pass  Alarm'd he calls aloud What feet are those  Which beat the echoing pavement of the rock  With speed reply nor tempt your instant fate  HE said and thus return'd a voice unknown  Not with the feet of enemies we come  But crave admittance with a friendly tongue  THE Spartan answers Through the midnight shade  What purpose draws your wandring steps abroad  TO whom the stranger We are friends to Greece  And to the presence of the Spartan king  Admission we implore The cautious chief  Of Lacedaemon hesitates again  When thus with accents musically sweet  A tender voice his wondring ear allur'd  O GEN'ROUS Grecian listen to the pray'r  Of one distress'd whom grief alone hath led  In this dark hour to these victorious tents  A wretched woman innocent of fraud  THE Greek descending through th'unfolded gates  Upheld a flaming brand One first appear'd  In servile garb attir'd but near his side  A woman graceful and majestic stood  Not with an aspect rivalling the power  Of fatal Hellen or the wanton charms  Of Love's soft queen but such as far excell'd  Whate'er the lilly blending with the rose  Paints on the cheek of beauty soon to fade  Such as express'd a mind which wisdom rul'd  And sweetness temper'd virtue's purest light  Illumining the countenance divine  Yet could not sooth remorseless fate nor teach  Malignant Fortune to revere the good  Which oft with anguish rends the spotless heart  And oft associates wisdom with despair  In courteous phrase began the chief humane  EXALTED fair who thus adorn'st the night  Forbear to blame the vigilance of war  And to the laws of rigid Mars impute  That I thus long unwilling have delay'd  Before the great Leonidas to place  This your apparent dignity and worth  HE spake and gently to the lofty tent  Of Sparta's king the lovely stranger guides  At Agis' summons with a mantle broad  His mighty limbs Leonidas infolds  And quits his couch In wonder he surveys  Th' illustrious virgin whom his presence aw'd  Her eye submissive to the ground inclin'd  With veneration of the godlike man  But soon his voice her anxious dread dispell'd  Benevolent and hospitable thus  THY form alone thus amiable and great  Thy mind delineates and from all commands  Supreme regard Relate thou noble dame  By what relentless destiny compell'd  Thy tender feet the paths of darkness tread  Rehearse th' afflictions whence thy virtue mourns  ON her wan cheek a sudden blush arose  Like day's first dawn upon the twilight pale  And wrapt in grief these words a passage broke  IF to be most unhappy and to know  That hope is irrecoverably fled  If to be great and wretched may deserve  Commiseration from the good behold  Thou glorious leader of unconquer'd bands  Behold descended from Darius' loins  Th' afflicted Ariana and my pray'r  Accept with pity nor my tears disdain  First that I lov'd the best of human race  By nature's hand with ev'ry virtue form'd  Heroic wise adorn'd with ev'ry art  Of shame unconscious does my heart reveal  This day in Grecian arms conspicuous clad  He fought he fell A passion long conceal'd  For me alas within my brother's arms  His dying breath resigning he disclos'd  OH I will stay my sorrows will forbid  My eyes to stream before thee and my heart  Thus full of anguish will from sighs restrain  For why should thy humanity be griev'd  With my distress and learn from me to mourn  The lot of nature doom'd to care and pain  Hear then O king and grant my sole request  To seek his body in the heaps of slain  THUS to the Spartan su'd the regal maid  Resembling Ceres in majestic woe  When supplicant at Jove's resplendent throne  From dreary Pluto and th'infernal gloom  Her lov'd and lost Proserpina she sought  Fix'd on the weeping queen with stedfast eyes  Laconia's chief these tender thoughts recall'd  SUCH are thy sorrows O for ever dear  Who now at Lacedaemon dost deplore  My everlasting absence then inclin'd  His head and sigh'd nor yet forgot to charge  His friend the gentle Agis through the straits  The Persian princess to attend and aid  With careful steps they seek her lover's corse  The Greeks remember'd where by Fate repress'd  His arm first ceas'd to mow their legions down  And from beneath a mass of Persian slain  Soon drew the hero by his armour known  To Agis' high pavilion they resort  Now Ariana what transcending pangs  Thy soul involv'd What horrour clasp'd thy heart  But love grew mightiest and her beauteous limbs  On the cold breast of Teribazus threw  The griefdistracted maid The clotted gore  Deform'd her snowy bosom O'er his wounds  Loose flow'd her hair and bubbling from her eyes  Impetuous sorrow lav'd the purple clay  When forth in groans her lamentations broke  O TORN for ever from my weeping eyes  Thou who despairing to obtain her heart  Who then most lov'd thee didst untimely yield  Thy life to Fate's inevitable dart  For her who now in agony unfolds  Her tender bosom and repeats her vows  To thy deaf ear who fondly to her own  Now clasps thy breast insensible and cold  Alas do those unmoving ghastly orbs  Perceive my gushing anguish Does that heart  Which Death's inanimating hand hath chill'd  Share in my suff'rings and return my sighs  Oh bitter unsurmountable distress  Lo on thy breast is Ariana bow'd  Hangs o'er thy face unites her cheek to thine  Not now to listen with enchanted ears  To thy persuasive eloquence no more  Charm'd with the wisdom of thy copious mind  SHE could no more Invincible despair  Suppress'd her utt'rance As a marble form  Fix'd on the solemn sepulcher unmov'd  O'er some dead hero whom his country lov'd  Bends down the head with imitated woe  So paus'd the princess o'er the breathless clay  Intranc'd in sorrow On the dreary wound  Where Dithyrambus' sword was deepest plung'd  Mute for a space and motionless she gaz'd  Then with a look unchang'd nor trembling hand  Drew forth a poniard which her garment veil'd  And sheathing in her heart th' abhorred steel  On her slain lover silent sinks in death  In vain the Spartan interven'd With tears  He view'd the prostrate lovers and exclaim'd  OH most unhappy heavy on your heads  Hath sorrow fall'n which o'er your pale remains  Commands this pity from a stranger's eye  Illustrious ruins may the grave impart  That peace which life denied And now receive  This pious office from a hand unknown  SO saying from his shoulders he unclasp'd  His ample robe and strew'd the waving folds  O'er the pale dead Then turning he bespake  The slave who stood beside him Thou who ledst  Thy queen illdestin'd to the fatal tents  Of Lacedaemon now returning bear  Her bleeding reliques to the Persian lord  Thou and these captives whom I free from bonds  ART thou a Spartan interrupts the slave  And dost thou counsel me to seek again  A clime unbless'd where freedom never dwells  No Bear me

stranger to thy hidden worth  Unconscious offer'd Thy ignoble garb  Conceal'd a virtue which I now revere  And since thy suff'ring soul hath long indur'd  The gloom of bondage and the hated face  Of tyrants view'd now change the horrid scene  Here freedom reigns and justice come and seek  With me their great protector Ending here  Swift he conducts him to Laconia's king  When Agis thus Leonidas address'd  LO far superiour to the name which marks  His habit with dishonour one who sues  For thy protection Here the slave subjoin'd  I stand thy suppliant now Thou soon shalt learn  If I deserve thy favour I intreat  To see th' assembled leaders of your host  For I am fraught with tydings which import  The weal of all the Grecians Agis streight  Appointed by Leonidas convenes  The various leaders To the tent they throng  Amidst them plac'd the stranger thus began  O ALPHEUS Maron hither turn your sight  And know your brothers From their seats they start  From either burst with tears of transport mix'd  The name of Polydorus On his breast  Each fondly strives to rush but he withstands  While down his cheek a stream of anguish pours  From his dejected eyes in torture bent  On that vile garb which sham'd his freeborn limbs  At length these accents intermix'd with groans  Broke from his heart while all stood wond'ring round  YOU first shall know if this unhappy slave  Yet merits your embraces Now approach'd  Leonidas Before him all recede  Ev'n Alpheus' self and yields his brother's hand  Which in his own the gen'rous hero press'd  Then with majestic goodness thus bespake  Th' afflicted youth and mitigates his pains  FORBEAR to mourn thou unexampled youth  Thy friends thy country all on thee shall gaze  With veneration whose unshaken mind  The chains of Asia never could debase  Lo ev'ry breast is open to thy worth  Each tongue prepares to hail thee with applause  Who hast thy country honour'd ev'n in bonds  HE ceas'd when Alpheus with an eager hand  Divests his brother of his base attire  And his own mantle o'er the shoulders threw  Of Polydorus Agis too advanc'd  With friendly arms infolds him and began  Now in thy native liberty secure  Smile on thy past afflictions and relate  What chance restor'd thy virtue to the Greeks  THEN Polydorus to the list'ning chiefs  I was a Spartan When my tender prime  On manhood border'd from my native shore  Snatch'd by Phoenician pirates I was sold  To Ariana sister to the king  And Hyperanthes Fortune there was kind  My bonds committing to that gentle hand  Yet was I still a captive and estrang'd  From Lacedaemon Demaratus oft  With friendly sorrows would my lot deplore  Nor less his own illfated virtue mourn'd  Lost to his country in a servile court  The center of corruption where in smiles  Is envy painted treachery and hate  And rankling malice where alone sincere  The dissolute seeks no disguise where he  Who all possesses that a king can give  Is far less happy than the meanest son  Of liberty and groveling as the slave  Who serves his cruel pride Yet here the sun  Ten times his annual period hath renew'd  Since Polydorus hath in bondage groan'd  My bloom now past or else by pining care  Untimely wither'd I at last return  And to my native land the tydings bear  Of instant desolation Here in grief  He paus'd when thus Leonidas Proceed  Though from thy lips inevitable fate  To all be threaten'd thou art heard by none  Whose dauntless souls can entertain a thought  But how to fall the noblest Thus the chief  The rest in speechless expectation wait  Such was the solemn silence which o'erspread  The shrine of Ammon or Dodona's shades  When anxious mortals from the mouth of Jove  Their doom explor'd Nor Polydorus long  Suspends the Grecians but resumes his tale  AS I this night accompanied the steps  Of Ariana e'er we reach'd the straits  Before our view then op'ning one appear'd  With hasty feet now traversing the way  Now fix'd intensely tow'rds the Grecian wall  Then on a sudden starting would renew  His restless pace As nearer we approach'd  He by the moon which glimmer'd o'er our heads  Descried us when advancing he demands  Where bent our midnight course I knew the voice  Of Demaratus To my breast I clasp'd  The venerable exile and replied  Our purpose ask not Sparta's camp we seek  And oh farewel for ever He rejoin'd  Thrice happy Polydorus Thou again  Shalt visit Sparta to these eyes denied  Upon your paths may heav'n's protection smile  Soon as you mix with yon triumphant tents  Say to the Spartans whose unconquer'd arms  Defend those rocks you saw their exil'd king  Say though their blind credulity depriv'd  The wretched Demaratus of his home  From ev'ry joy secluded which awaits  The parent and the husband from his wife  His offspring torn his friends and native gates  Him from his virtue could they ne'er divide  Say that ev'n here where all are kings or slaves  Amid the riot of flagitious courts  Not quite extinct the Spartan spirit glows  Within his breast though grief hath dim'd its fires  Remembring this to Lacedaemon's chief  Report that newly to the Persian host  Return'd a Malian Epialtes nam'd  Who as a spy had sought the Grecian tents  He to the tyrant magnified his art  Which with delusive eloquence had wrought  The Greeks to such despair that Asia's king  Had been e'er now their sov'reign master own'd  Had not the spirit of their single chief  By fear unconquer'd and on death resolv'd  Restor'd their valour therefore would the king  Trust to his guidance a selected band  They soon should pierce th' unguarded bounds of Greece  Led through a secret passage o'er the hills  Where no Leonidas should bar their way  Meantime by him the treach'rous Thebans sent  Assurance of their aid Th' assenting king  At once decreed two myriads to advance  With Hyperanthes with Abrocomes  And bold Hydarnes Ev'ry chief besides  Whom youth or valour or ambition warms  Rous'd by the traitor's eloquence attends  From all the nations fir'd with eager zeal  The first to enter Greece In silence now  The youth remains Tremendous from his seat  Uprose Plataea's chief His eyes were flames  And thus on trembling Anaxander burst  The furious accents from his livid lips  YET e'er we fall O traitor shall this arm  To hell's avenging furies sink thy head  ALL now is tumult ev'ry bosom swells  With rage untam'd and vengeance Half unsheath'd  Diomedon's impetuous falchion blaz'd  But as the Cholchian sorceress renown'd  In fables old or Circe when they fram'd  A potent spell from Erebus to wake  The dead in dark and fleeting forms to glide  Before the moon's dim twilight with their charms  Smooth'd all the sea and silenc'd each rude blast  Till not a billow heav'd against the shore  Nor ev'n the wantonwinged zephir breath'd  The lightest whisper through the magic air  So when thy voice Leonidas is heard  Fell Discord listens Rage with sacred awe  Subsides in silence while Confusion slept  WITHHOLD this rashness interpos'd the king  Before we punish let us find the guilt  Not yet hath Persia overturn'd our tents  Not yet her Barb'rous shouts our ears alarm  We still have time for vengeance and to know  If yet our swords destruction may repel  Or how to die most glorious Then arose  Dieneces and thus the Greeks bespake  E'ER yet they pass our borders Xerxes' host  Must learn to conquer and the Greeks to fly  The spears of Phocis guard the secret pass  Let instant messengers be thither sent  To know the Persians progress Alpheus here  LEONIDAS behold my willing feet  Shall to the Phocians bear thy great commands  Or climb the hills to mark th' approaching foe  THOU active son of valour thus returns  The chief of Lacedaemon in my thoughts  For ever present when the public cause  Demands the swift the vigilant and bold  Go and surmount the rocks aërial height  And while around Dieneces conducts  An hundred Spartans to the Phocians aid  Thou from the hills observe the Persians march  BEFORE the purplewinged morn the night  Retiring warn'd their conference to cease  They all disperse When hastning on his course  And ready now to climb the lofty crags  O Polydorus Alpheus thus exclaims  Long lost and late recover'd we must part  Once more and now for ever Thou return  And kiss the sacred soil which gave thee birth  Which calls thee back to freedom Dearest youth  I should have tears to give theebut farewel  My country chides me loit'ring in thy arms  THIS said he quits his brother and ascends  While Polydorus answers Alpheus no  I have the marks of bondage to erase  My blood must wash the shameful stain away  WE have a father Maron interpos'd  Thy unexpected presence will revive  His heavy age that childless else will mourn  Here Polydorus with a gloomy smile  ILL should I comfort others View these eyes  Faint is their light and vanish'd is my bloom  Before its hour of ripeness In my breast  Grief as a native will for ever dwell  Nor yield to time Unceasing shall my soul  Brood o'er the dire remembrance of my youth  In servitude thus wasted Life with me  Hath lost its savour Then in silent woe  He hangs his head His brother pleads in vain  He answers only with repeated groans  Now in his view Dieneces advanc'd  With Sparta's band On them his eyes are fix'd  Immoveable and thus his mind revolves  I TOO like these in Lacedaemon sprung  Instructed once like these to poize the spear  And lift the pond'rous shield Illdestin'd wretch  Thy arm is now enervate and would fail  Beneath the buckler's weight O cruel Heav'n  Who didst compel my freeborn hand to change  The warriour's arms for ignominious bonds  Wouldst thou compensate for my chains my shame  My ten years sorrows and the black despair  Which on my youth has prey'd propitious once  Grant I may bear my buckler to the field  And known a Spartan seek the shades below  HE ceas'd and sudden turn'd his steps aside  To find the tent of Agis there the youth  With grateful sorrow ministers his aid  While with a kind and hospitable hand  The gentle Agis by her lover's corse  On one sad bier the pallid beauties laid  Of Ariana He from shackles frees  Two Persian captives whom his gen'rous arm  That day preserv'd from slaughter then began  TO you I give that freedom which you sought  To snatch from me This recompense I ask  And this alone Transport to Asia's camp  These bleeding reliques bid the Persian king  Weep o'er this flow'r thus blasted in its pride  Then say th' alljudging Gods have thus ordain'd  Thou whose ambition o'er the groaning earth  Leads desolation o'er the nations spreads  Calamity and tears thou first shalt mourn  And through thy house destruction first shall range  THUS charg'd to Asia's host the captives bend  They soon attain the Phocian wall where now  Was Dithyrambus station'd He perceives  The mournful bier approach To him the fate  Of Ariana was already told  He meets the captives when with weeping eyes  On Teribazus turn'd he thus exclaims  O AS thy arms present thee hadst thou been  Indeed a Grecian then thy gen'rous heart  Its valour ne'er had wasted to support  A king's injustice then a gentler fate  Had bless'd thy life or bleeding thou hadst known  How sweet is death for liberty A Greek  This friendly wish affords thee though his head  Had lost the honours gather'd from thy fall  When fortune favour'd or propitious heav'n  Smil'd on the better cause Illfated pair  Whom with this stream of pity here I lave  But that my hostile hands imbru'd with gore  Must be ungrateful to your loathing shades  From all the neighb'ring valleys would I cull  Their fairest growth and strew your hearse with flow'rs  Yet O accept these tears and pious pray'rs  May peace attend your ashes may your shades  Pass o'er the silent pool to happier seats  Where tyrants ne'er can enter to molest  The blissful region but are far remov'd  To realms of horrour where from righteous heav'n  They bear those pains they merit from mankind  HE ceas'd in tears The captives leave the wall  And slowly down Thermopylae proceed  End of the Sixth Book  LEONIDAS BOOK VII  The argument  The bodies of Teribazus and Ariana are brought into the presence of Xerxes soon after a report had reach'd the camp that half his navy was shipwreck'd The Persian monarch quite dispirited is persuaded by Argestes one of the satraps to send an ambassador to the Spartan king Argestes himself is deputed who after revealing his ambassy to Leonidas in secret is by him led before the whole army and there receives his answer In the mean time Alpheus returns and declares that the enemies were possess'd of the passages in the hills and were hastening to Thermopylae upon which Leonidas offers to send away all the army except his three hundred Spartans but Diomedon Demophilus Dithyrambus and Megistias refuse to depart he then dismisses Argestes informs the Grecians of his design to attack the Persian camp in the night and making all the necessary dispositions retires to his pavilion  BEFORE the tent of Xerxes now arriv'd  The Persian captives On with solemn pace  And slow they move The monarch from afar  Descries their sad demeanour They approach  Nor he forbids That morn had Rumour told  The loss of half his navy dash'd on rocks  By angry blasts or buried in the surge  Thus when his bleeding sister met his eyes  Already sunk in sadness he had lost  His kingly pride the parent of disdain  And cold indifference for others woes  Nor ev'n beside his sister's nobler corse  Her humble lover now his scorn awak'd  In tears the captive's mournful tale he heard  And then first knew compassion but e'er long  Those traces vanish'd from the tyrant's breast  His former gloom redoubles for himself  His anxious bosom heaves and now he fears  Lest he with all his numbers should be cast  A prey to Fortune Near the monarch stood  The Spartan exile whom he thus bespake  O DEMARATUS what will fate ordain  Lo Fortune turns against me Who shall know  How far her daring malice may extend  Which rages now so near me and hath made  My house the seat of ruin I have sent  From my unshelter'd side my bravest chiefs  And choicest troops to pass the desart hill  Led by this Malian may not there the Greeks  With opposition more tremendous still  And ruinous than yester sun beheld  Resistless hold their craggy post renew  Their stony thunder with augmented rage  And send whole quarries down the rocky steep  Again to crush my legions Oh unfold  Thy secret soul nor hide the harshest truth  Say what remains to hope The exile here  IF truth unblam'd may issue from my lips  Too well imperial Xerxes you presage  What may befal your legions If the Greeks  Arrang'd within Thermopylae a pass  Accessible and spacious could repel  With such destruction their unnumber'd foes  What scenes of havoc must th' untrodden paths  Confin'd among the craggy hills afford  IMMERS'D in care the monarch silent sat  Amid th' incircling peers Argestes stood  A potent prince On Sipylus he reign'd  Whose lofty summits overlook'd the waves  Of Hermus and Pactolus either stream  Enrich'd with golden sands its tribute bore  To this great satrap through the servile court  Yet was there none more practic'd in the arts  Of mean submission none more skill'd to gain  The royal favour none who better knew  The phrase the looks and gesture of a slave  In soothing words he thus the king bespake  IF Xerxes will to spare his faithful bands  And not exert the terrours of his pow'r  More gentle means of conquest than by arms  Nor less secure may artifice supply  Renown'd Darius thy imperial sire  Great in the spoil of kingdoms long in vain  The fields of proud Euphrates with his host  O'erspread at length confiding in the wiles  Of Zopyrus the mighty king subdu'd  The Babylonian tow'rs but who shall count  What num'rous states by policy have fall'n  And let corruption once her aid impart  Not one shall stand What race of men possess  Such probity and wisdom whom the veil  Of craft may blind not nor corruption's charm  Seduce O Xerxes thou whom heav'n hath rais'd  To more than mortal greatness canst thou find  Through all thy empire which from India's shore  Shall reach Eurotas soon no dazzling gift  To gain the Grecian leader O dispel  The cloud of sadness from those sacred eyes  And proffer streight to Lacedaemon's chief  What may thy own munificence declare  And win his sword to aid thee Xerxes here  Rous'd from his trance of sorrow swift replied  WISE are thy words and counsels Go repair  My faithful servant to the Grecian chief  Fall down before him bid him join our arms  And he shall reign o'er all the Grecian states  AT once Argestes leaves the monarch's side  He now approaches to the Phocian wall  Thence Dithyrambus leads him to the tent  Of Lacedaemon's king Retreated there  Alone the hero meditating sat  On future woes to Persia At his feet  Prone bows Argestes and begun Thus low  Before thy awful presence Xerxes wills  That I should bend me prostrate to the earth  And thus accost thee Great and matchless chief  By fortune favour'd and belov'd by heav'n  Thus says the lord of Asia join our arms  And we reward thee with the sov'reign rule  O'er all the pow'rful states of haughty Greece  And O illustrious warriour heed my words  Think on the bliss of royalty the pomp  Of courts their endless pleasures trains of slaves  Who restless watch for thee and thy delights  With all the glories of unrivall'd sway  Look on th' Ionic and Aeolian Greeks  From them their fantom liberty is flown  While in each province rais'd by Xerxes' hand  Some favour'd chief presides exalted state  Which envious freedom gives not on his head  He bears the gorgeous diadem and sees  His equals once now prostrate at his throne  Yet how much greater thou whom gen'ral Greece  That teems with mightiest states shall call her lord  Thee only worthy How will Greece rejoice  Around thy throne and hail th' auspicious hour  When thou selected by the Persian king  To bless consenting nations with thy sway  Didst calm the fury of unsparing war  Which else had delug'd all with blood and flames  HE said The chief replies not but commands  The Thespian youth who near the tent had watch'd  To summon all the Grecians He obeys  While from his seat the hero mov'd and bade  The Persian follow He amaz'd attends  Surrounded soon by all the Grecian bands  When him the godlike Spartan thus bespake  HERE Persian tell thy ambassy repeat  That to obtain my friendship Asia's lord  Bids me accept the sov'reignty of Greece  Then view this band whose valour shall preserve  That Greece unconquer'd which your king bestows  And strew your bodies on its crimson plains  The indignation painted on their looks  And gen'rous scorn shall answer for their chief  THE hero ceas'd when suddenly return'd  The speed of Alpheus all suspended streight  On him direct their sight who thus began  E'ER I could join the Phocians from the hill  Which overhung the close defile I view'd  The pow'rs of Persia Down the narrow strait  No sooner gleam'd th' innumerable spears  But by our angry destiny misled  Or some curst daemon enemy to Greece  The Phocians quit their station Through the pass  An inundation of Barbarians pours  The traitor Epialtes is their guide  And to Thermopylae directs their course  HE here concludes Unutterable fear  In horrid silence wrapt the list'ning throng  Aghast confounded silent too were those  Who knew no terrour yet with wonder mute  Thickwedg'd inclos'd Leonidas around  Who thus with calmest elocution spoke  I NOW behold my destiny compleat  And how at last Leonidas must die  Here with the Spartans shall I rest behind  While you my faithful brave allies retreat  Then art thou near thou glorious sacred hour  Which shalt my country's liberty confirm  All hail thou solemn period thee the tongues  Of Virtue Fame and Freedom shall record  And celebrate in ages yet unborn  Then O farewel Megistias wise and brave  Thou too experienc'd venerable chief  Demophilus farewel farewel to thee  Invincible Diomedon to thee  Unequall'd Dithyrambus and to all  You other dauntless warriours who may claim  Praise from my lips and friendship from my heart  You after all the wonders which your swords  Have here accomplish'd shall enrich your names  With fresh renown Your valour must compleat  What we begin Here first th' astonish'd foe  A dying Spartan shall with terrour view  And tremble while he conquers then by fate  Led from his dreadful victory dismay'd  Against the phalanx of united Greece  By your unconquer'd spears himself shall fall  HERE interpos'd the fierce Plataean chief  By the twelve Gods enthron'd in heav'n supreme  By my fair name unsullied yet I swear  Ne'er shall thy eyes Leonidas behold  Diomedon forsake thee First let strength  Desert my limbs and valour shun my heart  Did I not face the Marathonian war  Have I not seen Thermopylae O Fame  What more canst thou bestow or I receive  Where can I living purchase brighter praise  Than dying here A more illustrious tomb  Where can I gain than underneath the heaps  Of Persians fall'n the victims of our sword  He ended when Demophilus subjoin'd  O KING of Sparta pride of human race  Whom none e'er equall'd but the seed of Jove  Thy own forefather number'd with the Gods  Lo I am old With faltring steps I tread  The prone descent of years The winged hours  By me as one unequal to their speed  Who can no more their fleeting joys attain  Unheeding slide My youth my country claim'd  My age no more can serve her what remains  What eligible hope can wisdom form  But to die well Upon this glorious earth  With thee unrivall'd hero will I close  The eve of life So spake the hoary chief  When Dithyrambus next O first of Greeks  Me too think worthy to attend thy fame  With this most dear and venerable man  For ever honour'd from my tend'rest age  Ev'n till on life's extremity we part  Nor too aspiring let my hopes be deem'd  Should the Barbarian in his triumphs mark  My youthful limbs among the gory heaps  Thence may his fears be doubled when again  He meets in fields hereafter to be known  The Grecian standards trembling at a foe  To whom the flow'r and blooming joys of life  Are less alluring than a noble fate  TO him Demophilus Wilt thou too bleed  My DithyrambusBut I here withhold  All counsel from thee who art wise as brave  If then thy magnanimity retain  Thee too with great Leonidas to fall  At either's side our limbs shall press the ground  And drop together in the arms of Death  So if th' attentive traveller we draw  To our cold reliques wondring shall he trace  The diff'rent scene and pregnant with applause  O wise old man exclaim thou well hast chose  The hour of fate and O unequall'd youth  Who to thy country didst thy bloom devote  Mayst thou remain for ever dear to Fame  May Time rejoice to name thee and may Peace  With gentlest pinions hover o'er thy urn  THIS said the hero with his lifted shield  His face o'ershades and drops a secret tear  Not this the tear of anguish but deriv'd  From fond affection grown mature with time  Which in a feebler mind to pain had turn'd  But in the Thespian's firm and virtuous breast  Alone a manly tenderness awak'd  Unmix'd with pity or with vain regret  MEGISTIAS last address'd the Spartan chief  Thou whom the Gods have chosen to exalt  Above mankind in virtue and renown  O call not me presumptuous who implore  Among these heroes thy regardful ear  To Lacedaemon I a stranger came  You there preserv'd me there with honours clad  Nor have I yet one benefit repay'd  That now the gen'rous Spartans may behold  In me their high beneficence not vain  Here to their cause I consecrate my breath  NOT so Megistias interpos'd the king  Thou and thy son retreat Again the seer  FORBID it thou eternally ador'd  O Jove confirm my persevering soul  Nor let my fear neglect this happy hour  To shew the Spartans I deserv'd their care  Thou Menalippus hear the king's command  And my paternal tenderness revere  Do thou withdraw thee from me to my hand  Thy arms resigning Fortune will supply  Fresh toil for valour Vanquish then or find  A glorious grave but spare thy father's eye  The bitter anguish to behold thy youth  Untimely bleed before him Grief suspends  His speech and interchangeably their arms  Impart their last embraces Either wept  The hoary parent and the blooming son  But from his temples the pontific wreath  Megistias now unloosens and resigns  His hallow'd vestments while the youth with tears  The helmet buckles o'er his snowy locks  And on his breast adjusts the radiant mail  WHILE such contempt of life such fervid zeal  To die with glory animate the Greeks  Far other thoughts possess Argestes' soul  Amaze with mingled terrour smote his heart  Cold drops distill'd from ev'ry pore bedew  His shiv'ring limbs his bosom pants his knees  Yield to their burthen ghastly pale his cheeks  Pale are his lips and trembling such the minds  Of slaves corrupt to them the beauteous face  Of Virtue turns to horrour But the chief  Of Lacedaemon now the wretch bespake  RETURN to Xerxes tell him on this rock  The Grecians faithful to their post await  His chosen myriads tell him thou hast seen  How far the lust of empire is below  A freeborn mind and tell him to behold  A tyrant humbled and by virtuous death  To seal my country's freedom is a good  Surpassing all his boasted pow'r can give  HE said the Persian hastens through the pass  But now once more Diomedon arose  Wrath overcasts his forehead while he spake  YET more must stay and bleed Inglorious Thebes  Ne'er shall receive her traitors back but here  Shall they attone their perfidy by death  Ev'n from their swords to whom their abject hearts  Have sacrific'd their faith Nor dare to hope  Ye vile deserters of the public weal  Ye coward slaves that mingled with the heaps  Of those who perish in their country's cause  You shall your shame conceal Whoe'er shall pass  Along this field of glorious slain and trace  With veneration ev'ry nobler corse  His soul though warm with generous applause  A while shall curb the transport to repeat  Its execrations o'er your impious heads  On whom that fate which gives to others fame  Is infamy and vengeance Dreadful thus  On the pale Thebans sentence he pronounc'd  Like Rhadamanthus from th' infernal throne  When with inexorable frowns he doom'd  The guilty dead to everduring pain  While Phlegethon its flaming billows roll'd  Before their sight and ruthless furies shook  Their hissing serpents All the Greeks assent  With clamours echoing through the concave rock  FORTH Anaxander in th'assembly stood  And thus began with indignation feign'd  If yet your clamours Grecians are allay'd  Behold I stand before you to demand  Why these my brave companions who alone  Of all the Thebans under my command  Durst force their passage through dissuading crouds  To join your host should now be traitors deem'd  Accus'd by one alone a banish'd wretch  Whom Lacedaemon in her anger drove  Far from her confines one who meanly sought  A servile court for shelter has he drawn  Such virtues thence that Sparta who before  Held him unworthy of his native soil  Should trust him now before auxiliar friends  Injurious Greeks we scorn the thought of flight  Let Asia bring her millions unconstrain'd  We wait the conflict and for Greece will die  THUS in the garb of virtue he adorn'd  Necessity deluding ev'ry Greek  Except Laconia's hero He perceiv'd  Through all its fair disguise the traitor's heart  So when at first mankind in science rude  Rever'd the moon as bright with native beams  Some sage that walk'd with Nature through her works  By Wisdom led discern'd the various orb  Itself was dark in foreign splendours clad  Now unexpected with his troop return'd  Dieneces and thus to Sparta's king  I NEED not tell thee that the Persian pow'rs  Have pass'd the secret strait This night they halt  But with the morning will invade us here  We come to die with thee United thus  Our strength a fiercer contest shall maintain  Whence a more bright example to our friends  And stronger terrour of the Grecian name  HE said when thus Leonidas began  O Spartans hear and all you other Greeks  Whose matchless virtue shall inroll your names  In Time's eternal records and inhance  Your country's lustre lo the setting sun  Inflames the broad horizon All retire  And in your tents invoke the pow'r of sleep  To aid your vigour and to give your limbs  Unwearied patience of continued toil  But when the second watch begins let all  With mutual exhortation rouse to arms  For soon as Cynthia from the vault of heav'n  Hath hung her shining lamp through Asia's host  Shall death with horrour and amazement rage  Their camp is open to our swords depriv'd  Of all its chosen warriours But I charge  All ev'n the Spartans who are maim'd or weak  To pain or toil unequal from our camp  This hour to hasten You our brave allies  Of Corinth Phlius with th' Arcadian bands  And Mycenaeans must not yet return  But here while we repose in arms remain  When we our tents abandon then depart  HE said all heard obedient and dispers'd  While to his tent the godlike chief repairs  And with him Agis whom he thus bespake  O AGIS hear and mark my last command  With wary skill dispose the nightly guard  That no deserter from the Theban tents  May reach the camp of Asia or ascend  To those now halting on the neighb'ring hills  Nor yet with us the faithless band must join  Not with such base associates must we trust  Our great design Their perfidy might soon  Find means to rouse the unsuspecting foe  And all our glorious enterprise confound  Then O my faithful Agis e'er we move  While on the solemn sacrifice intent  As Lacedaemon's sacred laws ordain  Our pray'rs we offer to the tuneful nine  Do thou in whispers charge the Theban train  Slow and in silence to disperse and fly  This said they parted On his couch alone  Reclines the hero where he thus revolves  MY fate is now impending O my heart  What more auspicious period could I chuse  For death than now when beating high with joy  Thou tell'st me I am happy If to live  Or die as Virtue dictates be to know  The purest bliss if she her charms display  Still beauteous still unfading still serene  To youth to age to death whatever be  Those other climes of uncorruptive joy  Which Heav'n in dark futurity conceals  Still here O Virtue thou art all our good  Then what a black unspeakable reverse  The wretched offspring of Injustice prove  What in the struggle of departing day  When life's last glimpse extinguishing presents  Th' unknown inextricable gloom of death  But can I paint the terrours of a breast  Where guilt resides Leonidas forego  The horrible conception seek again  Thy own untroubled heart and grateful bow  To those benignant pow'rs who fram'd thy mind  In crimes unfruitful never to admit  The black impression of a guilty thought  Else could I fearless thus relinquish life  No Such unshaken calmness from th' unjust  Is ever absent Oft in them the rage  Of some prevailing passion for a time  Suppresses fear Oft hurried on they lose  The sense of danger when dominion pow'r  And purple pomp their dazzled sight enchant  Yet still the joys of life alone they seek  But he who calmly meets resistless fate  When glory only and the gen'ral good  Invite him forward must possess a soul  Which all content deducing from itself  Can by unerring virtue's constant light  Discern when death is worthy of his choice  The man thus great and happy in the scope  Of his large mind is stretch'd beyond his date  Ev'n on this shore of being he in thought  Supremely bless'd anticipates the good  Which late posterity from him derives  THE hero clos'd his meditation here  The swelling transports of his mind subside  In soft oblivion while the silken plumes  Of sleep envelop his extended limbs  End of the Seventh Book  LEONIDAS BOOK VIII  The argument  Leonidas rising about three hours before midnight relates to an assembly of the leaders a dream which is interpreted by Megistias he then arms himself and marches in procession with his whole troop to an altar newly rais'd on a neighbouring meadow and there offers a sacrifice to the Muses he invokes the assistance of those Goddesses he animates his companions and then placing himself at their head leads them against the enemy in the dead of the night  SCARCE was begun the second watch of night  When his pavilion Agis left and sought  The chief of Lacedaemon Him he found  Spread on his tranquil couch while o'er his face  Diffus'd a glad serenity with smiles  His slumber painted like an ev'ning sky  Yet streak'd with ruddy light when summer suns  Have veil'd their beaming foreheads Transport fill'd  The eye of Agis Friendship swell'd his heart  And veneration On his knee inclin'd  The hero's hand he kiss'd and thus began  O THOU with more than human virtues great  Accept this homage and may gentle sleep  Yet longer close thy eyelids that unblam'd  I thus may bow before thee Thus he spake  And prostrate bent his godlike friend rever'd  Whose eye the shades of slumber now forsake  So when new rising heav'n's resplendent orb  Illumines first the sable skirts of night  The whiterob'd Magi or the Indian seers  Are seen from Ganges or Euphrates' side  Before th' emerging glory bow'd to hail  The radiant emblem of th' immortal mind  BOTH heroes rose and mix'd their friendly arms  And now to Agis had the Spartan king  Disclos'd his soul when lo the Grecian chiefs  All rous'd advancing with the sudden gleam  Of armour pierc'd the twilight shade With joy  Leonidas accosts them O thrice hail  My virtuous friends Approach and all attend  While I relate and you with wonder hear  This night no sooner sleep oppress'd my brows  But o'er my head the empyreal form  Of my great sire Alcides seem'd display'd  I saw his magnitude divine his voice  I heard his solemn mandate to arise  I rose He bade me follow I obey'd  Up to a mountain whose ethereal brow  Th' involving clouds divided we ascend  E'er long we rested suddenly the howl  Of wolves and dogs the vulture's piercing shriek  The yell of ev'ry beast and fowl of prey  Within my ears discordant broke I turn'd  When lo a surface all with gore deform'd  Beyond my view illimitable stretch'd  One vast expanse of horrour There a corse  Which with its huge dimensions seem'd to hide  Th' unbounded plain lay welt'ring red with wounds  Delv'd in th' enormous limbs which bleeding gorg'd  The vulture's famine Wond'ring I beheld  When from behind I heard a second sound  Like surges trembling o'er a craggy shore  Again I turn'd An ocean there appear'd  With riven keels and shrouds and shiver'd oars  With arms and mangled carcases bestrewn  Innumerous The billows foam'd with blood  And whelm'd a crimson deluge o'er the strand  But where the waters unobserv'd before  Between two adverse shores contracting roll'd  A stormy tide upon the beach forlorn  One of majestic stature I descried  In ornaments imperial Oft on me  He bent his clouded eyeballs On my name  With imprecations oft he call'd aloud  Then rent his splendid garments and his head  In rage divested of its graceful hairs  Impatient now he ey'd a slender skiff  Which mounted on the curling foam approach'd  With indignation and reluctant grief  Once more his sight reverting he embark'd  Amid the perils of the frowning waves  O thou whose virtue rank'd thee with the Gods  I here exclaim'd instruct me what produc'd  This desolation when the God return'd  Let thy astonish'd eye again review  What thou didst late abhor I look'd and saw  A land where Plenty with disporting hand  Pour'd all the fruits of Amalthea's horn  Where bloom'd the olive and the clustring vine  With its broad foliage mantled ev'ry hill  Where Ceres with exuberance inrob'd  The pregnant bosom of the fields in gold  Where spacious towns whose circuits proud contain'd  The dazling works of wealth unnumber'd shone  The strength and splendour of the peopled land  Then in a moment clouds obscur'd my sight  And all was vanish'd from my waking eyes  THRICE we salute the omen thus began  The sage Megistias in thy mystic dream  I see the Grecian victories The earth  The deep shall own their triumphs and the tears  Of Asia and of Lybia shall bewail  Their offspring cast before the vulture's beak  And all the monstrous natives of the main  Those joyous fields of plenty shall be Greece  Enrich'd with conquest and Barbarian spoils  And whom thou saw'st in regal vesture clad  Print on the sands his solitary steps  Is Xerxes foil'd and fugitive from Greece  MEGISTIAS thus while ev'ry bosom felt  Enthusiastic rapture joy beyond  All sense and all conception but of those  Who die to save their country Here again  Leonidas th' exulting chiefs address'd  SINCE happiness from virtue is deriv'd  Who for his country dies that moment proves  Most happy as most virtuous Such our lot  To this the gods shall add eternal fame  But now go forth Megistias and with speed  Prepare the victim and the sacred flames  That to the Muses as the Spartan law  Commands our pray'rs and off'rings may be paid  E'er to yon camp our hostile feet we bend  But O remember from the solemn rites  Let ev'ry sound be absent not the pipe  Nor ev'n the musicbreathing flute be heard  Meantime ye leaders ev'ry band instruct  To move in silence nor with shouts alarm  The midnight stillness Mindful of their charge  The chiefs depart Leonidas provides  His various armour First the breastplate arms  His ample chest O'er this the hero spreads  The mailed cuirass from his shoulders hung  The shining belt infolds his mighty loins  Next on his stately temples he erects  The plumed helm then grasps his pond'rous shield  Where nigh the center on the swelling brass  Th' inimitable artist had imboss'd  The shape of great Alcides whom to gain  Two Goddesses contended Pleasure here  Won with soft wiles th' attracted eye and there  The form of Virtue dignified the scene  In her majestic sweetness was disclos'd  The mind sublime and happy From her lips  Seem'd eloquence to flow With looks serene  But fix'd intent upon the son of Jove  She wav'd her hand where winding to the skies  Her paths ascended On the summit stood  Fame and protended her eternal trump  Incumbent on a trophy near to heav'n  The youth attentive to her wisdom own'd  The prevalence of Virtue while his eye  With all the spirit which redeem'd the world  From tyranny and monsters ardent flam'd  Not undescried by Pleasure where she lay  Stretch'd on a gorgeous carpet which bespread  The meadow with magnificence Around  Were flourets strewn and wantonly in rills  Soft streams maeander'd All relax'd her limbs  Nor wanting yet solicitude to gain  What lost she fear'd as struggling with despair  She seem'd collecting all her power of charms  And with excess of sweet allurement smil'd  In vain for Virtue sway'd Alcides' mind  Hence all his labours Trac'd with various art  They fill'd the surface of the spacious targe  This portraiture of glory on his arm  Leonidas supports Then forth he tow'rs  From his pavilion With their troops array'd  The chiefs attended Flaming torches blaz'd  In ev'ry hand And now with silent pace  All to the solemn sacrifice proceed  First Polydorus with the hallow'd knife  And barley strew'd with sacred salt advanc'd  Diomedon beside him in his grasp  A weighty mace sustaining Like the rest  All bright in armour with his shield and spear  Megistias follow'd an unspotted priest  And dauntless warriour From on high his helm  With wreaths around the shining crest reveal'd  His sacerdotal honours By the horns  Where laurels twin'd with Alpheus Maron leads  The consecrated ox And lo behind  Leonidas approaches Ne'er before  With such transcending majesty he trod  Nor his own virtue as that hour enjoy'd  Then venerable moves the Thespian chief  And great Dieneces To them the bloom  Of Dithyrambus glowing with the sense  Of future praise succeeds with graceful steps  The gen'rous Agis next the Thebans last  Repining and inglorious Then slow march  The host all mute nor shake their brazen arms  NOT from Thermopylae remote the hills  Of Oeta yielding to a fruitful dale  Within their side halfcircling had inclos'd  A fair expanse with verdure smooth The bounds  Were edg'd with wood o'erlook'd by snowy cliffs  Which from the clouds bent frowning From a rock  Above the loftiest summit of the groves  A tumbling torrent wore the shagged stone  Then gleaming through the interwoven shade  The valley water'd O'er the level shone  Its glassy bosom and with placid waves  The smiling lawn divided Near the banks  Which flow'rs made various newerected stood  A rustic altar which a chosen train  Appointed by Megistias rais'd with turf  Cut by their falchions from the verdant mead  Broad was the surface high with piles of wood  The plenteous tribute of th' adjacent groves  All interspers'd with laurel Here a vase  Fill'd with the briny waters of the sea  More pure than ev'ry stream or fountain deem'd  Was plac'd beside the altar There with wine  Unmix'd capacious goblets stood arrang'd  Here is the victim brought Megistias streight  His helm unloosens With his hoary head  Uncover'd round the solemn pile he treads  And with a branch of laurel scatters wide  The sacred moisture of the main His hand  With mingled salt and barley next bestrews  The altar and the victim O'er the horns  Th' inverted goblet foaming with the grape  Diffus'd the rich libation Now advanc'd  Diomedon Megistias gave command  Down sunk the victim with a deathful stroke  Nor groan'd Megistias buries in the throat  The hallow'd steel A crimson deluge flows  Swift from the limbs the fuming hide is torn  The flesh dissever'd on the altar heap'd  Now smoaks the pile then sudden flames abroad  A burst of splendour dissipates the dark  Greece throngs around Each lifts a sparkling brand  With beaming javelins intermix'd and shields  And polish'd helms which multiply the blaze  Meantime the great Leonidas drew nigh  And stood before the altar There his helm  Unclasp'd to Agis he commits his shield  And spear to Dithyrambus then his arms  Extending thus in supplication spoke  HARMONIOUS daughters of Olympian Jove  Who on the top of Helicon ador'd  And high Parnassus with delighted ears  Bend to the warble of Castalia's wave  And Aganippe's murmurs if from thence  We must invoke your presence or along  The ridge of neighb'ring Pindus if your steps  Now wander through your consecrated bow'rs  Thence turn ye Muses nor for once disdain  Each with her beauteous form these hills to grace  And stand th' immortal witness of our fate  But with you bring fair Liberty whom Jove  And you most honour Let her sacred eyes  Approve her dying Grecians let her voice  With exultation tell the earth and heav'ns  These are her sons then strike your tuneful shells  And with our praise bid harmony rejoice  Record us guardians of our parents age  Our matrons virtue and our infants bloom  And glorious bulwarks of our country's laws  Who shall enoble the historian's page  Or on the joyous festival inspire  With loftier strains the virgins choral song  Then O celestial maids on yonder camp  Let night sit heavy and a sleep like death  Weigh down the eye of Asia O infuse  A cool untroubled spirit in our breasts  Which may in silence guide our daring feet  Through all the paths of slaughter nor affright  The dark with tumult till the dying groans  Of gasping tyrants into horrour wake  The midnight calm Then turn Destruction wild  Bid Terrour and Confusion revel round  And in one carnage heap the Barb'rous ranks  Their horse and chariots Let the spurning steed  Imbrue his hoofs with blood and shatter'd cars  Crush with their brazen weight the prostrate necks  Of kings and purpled chiefs incircled round  By nations fall'nYou countrymen and friends  My last commands attend Your gen'ral's voice  Once more salutes you not to rouse the brave  Or minds resolv'd and dauntless to confirm  Too well by this expiring blaze I view  Impatient valour flash from ev'ry eye  But temper well your ardour and your lips  Close on the rising transport Lo how sleep  Hath folded millions in its black embrace  No sound is wasted from th' unnumber'd foe  The winds themselves are silent All conspires  To this great sacrifice where thousands soon  Shall only wake to die Perhaps our swords  This night may send ev'n Xerxes' self to lead  Th' innumerable train of Persian ghosts  To Pluto's dreery shade unless reserv'd  From all this ruin to lament his shame  And future flight when Greece confounds that pow'r  Which we will shake But now the second watch  Is verging to its period and the moon  Prepares to glimmer on our darksome steps  Let each his head distinguish with a wreath  Of twining laurel then the goblet crown  And share the victim Take your last repast  For with your fathers and the heroes old  You next shall banquet in the blest abodes  WHILE thus the hero through the thronging files  Presenting round a hideous depth of war  All shook with ardour their erected spears  Thick as the fruitful growth of lofty pines  Which from high Pelion's cloudinvested brow  To heav'n's blue vault their stately honours bear  Megistias soon through all the band divides  The sacred laurel snatch'd with eager zeal  By ev'ry hand and round each helmet wove  It blends its verdure with the floating plumes  Then is the victim portion'd while the bowl  Flows with the vine's impurpled stream Aloof  The Theban train in wan dejection mute  Brood o'er their shame or cast a frighted eye  On that determin'd virtue which unmov'd  At fate's approach with chearful lips could taste  The sparkling goblet and with joy partake  That last and glorious banquet Ev'n the heart  Of Anaxander now forgets its wiles  Its fear no more dissembling Agis here  For ever mindful of his friend's command  Mix'd with the Thebans and in whispers thus  LEONIDAS permits you to retire  While in the rites of sacrifice employ'd  None heed your motions Separate and fly  With silent steps At once the Theban troop  Its ranks dissolving from the Greeks withdraws  Unseen it moulders from the host like snow  Which from the mountains in ten thousand rills  Soon as the sun exerts his orient beam  Descends softtrickling while the hoary heap  Insensibly decays The Grecians soon  Conclude the solemn banquet and their chief  Now reassumes his arms Before his step  The croud rolls backward In their gladden'd sight  His crest irradiate with th' uplifted brands  Its purple splendour shakes The tow'ring oak  Thus from a lofty promontory waves  Its majesty of verdure while with joy  The sailor marks its heav'nascending pride  Which from afar directs his foamy course  Along the pathless Ocean so the Greeks  Exulting gaz'd as down their op'ning ranks  Their chief proceeds from whose majestic grace  A soul like thine O Phidias might conceive  In Parian marble or effulgent brass  The form of great Apollo when the God  Won by the pray'rs of man's afflicted race  In arms forsook his lucid throne to pierce  The monster Python in the Delphian vale  Close by the hero Polydorus waits  To guide destruction through the Asian tents  As the young eagle near his parent's side  In wanton flight essays his vig'rous wings  E'er long with her to penetrate the clouds  To dart impetuous on the fleecy train  And dye his beak with gore by Sparta's king  The injur'd Polydorus thus prepares  His arm for death and feasts his angry soul  With promis'd vengeance his impatient thoughts  Ev'n now transport him furious to the seat  Of his long sorrows not with shackled hands  But now once more a Spartan with his shield  And dreadful spear to lead his country's bands  And with them vengeance Nor the rest of Greece  Neglect to form Their helmets now unite  Their various plumage as th' intwining boughs  Mix their broad foliage in Dodona's grove  Or like the cedars on the Syrian hills  Which with their shady texture as with night  The gloomy soil o'ercast In order'd ranks  While thus they stand behold a warlike form  In gleaming arms slowmoving through the shade  Led by a slave approach'd Laconia's king  And thus address'd him O Leonidas  Thou seest before thee Eurytus a name  To thee and ev'ry Spartan not unknown  Thy ruling voice forbade the maim'd to stay  I whose dark orbs no longer know the sun  Immers'd in sudden blindness since our march  From Lacedaemon with the rest withdrew  Not to revisit Sparta but resolv'd  To meet the Persians in the public way  I sat not long before th' increasing sound  Of trampling feet alarm'd me which I deem'd  Were Persia's numbers rushing from the hills  I started upward grasping in my hand  My spear and buckler by my slave withheld  Who told me they were Thebans Lo I bear  The tydings of their flight And now my chief  And countrymen farewel Do you proceed  With death and terrour fill the hostile camp  While I the fury of th' exulting foe  Descending from the mountains here await  To yield the last remains of tedious life  Now to my country useless and to me  And close these shaded eyes in endless night  HE ceas'd when thus Leonidas began  Then stay my faithful soldier and obtain  Not the least honours in this glorious night  And you my brave associates all exult  One spirit now inspires us from our band  Doubt fear and treason with the Thebans fly  While all with mutual confidence advance  And equal fires This said once more the king  On the deep phalanx his attentive eye  Reverts and through the ruddy gleam descries  One face of gladness but th' illustrious van  He most contemplates Agis Alpheus there  Megistias Maron and Plataea's chief  Dieneces Demophilus are drawn  And Dithyrambus They their fixed sight  On him too bend with inexpressive joy  With love and veneration till they hear  His last command when instant to the earth  Are cast th' extinguish'd brands On all around  Drops sudden darkness on the hills the woods  The silver stream the rocks and floating main  It now was midnight To the hostile camp  With steps compos'd and silent down the pass  The phalanx moves Each patient bosom hush'd  Its struggling spirit nor in whispers breath'd  The rapt'rous ardour virtue then inspir'd  But all await the moment doom'd to give  The Barb'rous millions to their deathful steel  So low'ring clouds expanding from the north  A while suspend their horrours destin'd soon  To blaze in lightnings and to burst in storms  End of the Eighth Book  LEONIDAS BOOK IX  The argument  Leonidas and the Grecians penetrate through the Persian camp to the very pavilion of Xerxes who avoids destruction by flight The Barbarians are slaughter'd in great multitudes and their camp is set on fire Leonidas conducts his men back to Thermopylae engages the Persians who were descended from the hills and after numberless proofs of superiour strength and valour sinks down cover'd with wounds and expires the last of all the Grecian commanders  THE waining moon display'd her gleaming horns  When o'er th' unguarded bound of Asia's camp  Now pass'd the Grecians Through th' unnumber'd tents  Where all was mute and tranquil they pursue  Their silent march The eastern world around  Lay stretch'd in slumber motionless and deaf  Wrapt in the dead security of night  Nor mark'd the steps of Fate The wary Greeks  By Polydorus guided still proceed  Ev'n to the center of th' extensive host  Unseen they pierc'd when now th' imperial tent  Yet distant rose before them Wide around  The proud pavilion stretch'd an ample space  Where myriads might imbattle Here a band  Of chosen Persians watchful round their king  Held their nocturnal station As the hearts  Of anxious nations menac'd with the waste  Of meager famine and the ruthless sword  Sink in their frozen bosoms while despair  Sees fearingender'd fantoms in the sky  Aërial hosts amid the clouds array'd  Which seem to shake the firmament with war  Portending woe and death the Persians thus  Are smote with consternation as the moon  By her faint beam discover'd from afar  The glimpse of Grecian arms With sudden cries  They waken Horrour which to Xerxes' couch  And o'er th' astonish'd host swiftwinged flew  Dispelling sleep and silence All the camp  Pours forth its numbers naked pale unarm'd  Wild with amazement blinded by dismay  To ev'ry foe obnoxious when at once  Plung'd in ten thousand breasts the Grecian steel  Reeks with destruction Deluges of blood  Float o'er the field and foam around the heaps  Of wretches slain unconscious of the hand  Which mows them down by legions From his couch  The lord of Asia and of L  bia st  Amaze affright distraction in his look  And sees in thought united Greece advance  Where then was fled the empty pride of kings  The hope of glory and the lust of pow'r  What then avail'd th' innumerable range  Of thy huge camp save only to conceal  Thy trembling steps O Xerxes while thou fliest  Leonidas before the Grecian van  Through bleeding thousands hews his dreadful way  Before him Terrour strides Gigantic Death  And Desolation at his side attend  With all the Furies of insatiate war  To Xerxes' tent the hero speeds nor finds  His victim Ardent throngs of Grecians fill  The stately mansion to the ground are hurl'd  The glitt'ring ensigns of imperial pow'r  The diadem the scepter late ador'd  And fear'd by millions underneath their feet  With mingled rage and scorn the Grecians crush  A sacrifice to Freedom Now return  The furious bands Leonidas exalts  For new destruction his resistless spear  When sudden night o'ershrouds the spangled heav'ns  And clouds condensing intercept the moon  Black o'er the furrow'd main the raging east  In whirlwinds sweeps the surge Now roars the coast  The crashing forests and the cavern'd rocks  Swift through the camp the hurricane impells  Its dire career when Asia's numbers veil'd  Amid the shelt'ring horrours of the storm  Evade the Spartan lance The Grecians halt  By great Leonidas restrain'd and wait  Near Xerxes' tent their mighty leader's will  BESIDE the high pavilion from the time  That Xerxes near Thermopylae had drawn  His num'rous bands perpetual fire had shone  Before whose sacred light the Persian lord  Was wont among his Magi to adore  The power of Oromasdes piles of wood  Lay nigh prepar'd to feed the constant flame  These on the altar by the Greeks are strewn  So wills Laconia's hero while the winds  Excite the blaze his phalanx he divides  Four bands are form'd by Dithyrambus led  By Alpheus by Diomedon the last  Himself commands The word is giv'n the Greeks  Press to the fire soon shrink the burning heaps  Destructive flames they brandish and injoin'd  To reassemble at the regal tent  By various paths the hostile camp invade  RESISTLESS desolation now involves  The Malian fields as o'er the eastern tents  From diff'rent stations flew ten thousand brands  Hurl'd by the Greeks unrespited The winds  With violence redoubled breathing round  Tempestuous rage exasperate the blaze  The conflagration like a sea expands  Collected now from ev'ry part it forms  One waving surface of unbounded fire  In ruddy volumes mount the curling flames  To heav'n's dark vault and paint the midnight clouds  So when the north emits its purpled lights  The undulating radiance streaming wide  As with a burning canopy invests  Th' ethereal concave Oeta now disclos'd  Its forehead glitt'ring with eternal frost  While down the rocks the foamy torrents shone  Far o'er the main the pointed rays were thrown  Night snatch'd her mantle from the ocean's breast  The billows glimmer from the distant shores  But where ascends a pillar huge of smoke  With wreathing flames incircled Horrour there  And Death on great Leonidas attend  He bade th' exulting Polydorus lead  Where Asia's horse and chariots stood arrang'd  There at his word devouring Vulcan feasts  On all the tribute which Thessalia's meads  Yield to the scythe and riots on the heaps  Of Ceres emptied of the ripen'd grain  A flood of fire envelopes all the ground  The cordage bursts of ev'ry blazing tent  Down sink the roofs and overwhelm the throng  Of wretches panting from the Spartan sword  Closewedg'd with fear the Libyan chariot burns  Th' Arabian camel and the Persian steed  Bound through the fiery deluge wild with pain  They shake their singed manes with madding hoofs  Dash through the blood of thousands mix'd with flames  That rage augmented by the whirlwind's blast  MEANTIME the scepter'd lord of half the globe  Through the wide tumult like a guilty slave  From tent to tent precipitates his flight  Dispers'd are all his satraps Pride itself  Shuns his dejected brow Despair alone  With pale Confusion and with frantic Fear  Wait on th' imperial fugitive and shew  As round the camp his eye distracted roves  No limits to destruction Now was seen  Aurora mounting from the eastern hills  In rosy sandals and with dewy locks  The winds subside before her darkness flies  And streams of light proclaim the chearful day  When now at Xerxes' tent the Grecian band  Was reunited What could Fortune more  To aid the valiant and to gorge revenge  Lo Desolation o'er the Persian host  Hath emptied all its horrours ev'n the hand  Of languid slaughter drops its crimson steel  Nor Nature longer can sustain the toil  Of everduring conquest Yet what pow'r  Among the Grecians once again reviv'd  Their drooping warmth newbrac'd their nerves and call'd  Their wearied swords to deeds of brighter fame  What but th' inspiring hope of glorious death  To crown their labour and th' auspicious look  Of their heroic chief which still unchang'd  Still with superiour majesty declar'd  No toil had yet relax'd his matchless strength  Nor worn the vigour of his godlike soul  Down to the pass with gentle march he leads  Th' imbattled warriors There behind the shrubs  Which near the verdant feet of Oeta sprung  Beside the entrance of the straits the Greeks  In ambush lay The tempest now was calm'd  Soft breezes only from the Malian wave  O'er each grim face besmear'd with smoke and gore  Their cool refreshment breath'd The healing gale  Dispells the languor from their harass'd limbs  Which swell with strength returning After all  Th' incessant labours of the horrid night  Through flames and war continu'd they prepare  In order'd battle to confront the pow'rs  Of Hyperanthes that selected band  From Asia's numbers destin'd with the morn  To pass the mountains in triumphant march  With strength unwasted and with souls elate  Not long the Greeks in expectation stood  Impatient Sudden with tumultuous shouts  Like Nile's swift current where with deafning roar  Prone from the steep of Elephantis falls  Its sea of waters Hyperanthes pours  His rapid legions o'er the Grecian camp  Down from the hills precipitant No foe  Is found to stop the torrent on they roll  With thund'ring footsteps o'er the sounding pass  THAT night no sooner had the Theban train  Thermopylae forsaken but their course  They bent along the mountains till they met  The pow'rs of Xerxes Dusky twilight still  Prevailing Persia with misguided rage  Assail'd her friends unknown Th'impetuous spear  Of Hyperanthes clove the faithless heart  Of Anaxander on the hero press'd  And spread destruction through their bleeding ranks  Nor check'd his ardent valour till he heard  The name of Thebes in suppliant cries proclaim'd  The Persians then receive them in the front  As guides they place them and amaz'd to learn  That daring Greece should Xerxes' camp invade  Haste from the mountains rush along the pass  And now tumultuous issue from its mouth  At once Laconia's leader gives the sign  When as th' impulsive ram with dreadful sway  O'erturns the nodding rampart from its base  And strews a town with ruin so the band  Of serried heroes down the Malian steep  An hideous depth the blended numbers swept  Of Thebes and Persia There no waters flow  But horrid rocks present their craggy sides  There dash'd whole legions From their mangled limbs  A tide of blood rolls foaming to the sea  Again thy voice Leonidas is heard  The Grecians turn against the op'ning pass  They point their wheeling phalanx on they rush  Astonish'd Persia stops in full career  Ev'n Hyperanthes starts with terrour back  Confusion drives fresh numbers from the shore  Whelm'd in the Malian slime Th' undaunted king  Of Lacedaemon enter'd now the straits  And rang'd for battle Hyperanthes soon  Recall'd his chosen warriours from their fear  Swift on the great Leonidas was bent  A grove of darts th' incount'ring armies clos'd  WHOM first whom last great Spartan didst thou foil  What rivers heard along their echoing banks  Thy name in curses sounded from the lips  Of mothers wailing for their slaughter'd sons  What towns with empty monuments were fill'd  For those whom thy unconquerable sword  This day to vultures cast First Bessus died  A haughty satrap whose tyrannic hand  Despoil'd Hyrcania of her golden sheaves  And laid her forests waste For him the bees  Among the branches interwove their sweets  For him the fig was ripen'd and the vine  With rich profusion o'er the goblet foam'd  Then Dinis bled On Hermus' side he reign'd  And long had sought with unavailing love  Great Artemisia fam'd in Xerxes' fleet  The martial queen of Caria She disdain'd  The lover's soft complaint her dauntless ear  Was taught to mark the tempest while it rag'd  Her sight was practic'd from the rolling deck  To brave the chafing billows doom'd to meet  That day of horrour when the weeping eye  Of Xerxes saw the blood of nations flow  And to its bottom tinge the briny floods  Of Salamis whence she with Asia fled  She only not inglorious low reclines  Her lover now on Hermus' banks no more  To sound her name nor tell the vocal groves  His fruitless sorrows Then Madauces fell  A Paphlagonian born amid the sound  Of dashing surges and the roar of winds  Who o'er th' unhospitable Euxine waves  Was wont from high Carambis' cliff to watch  Th' illfated bark which cut the Pontic stream  Then with his dire associates through the deep  For spoil and slaughter guide his hostile prow  With these Tithraustes far from Medus fall'n  His native tide with blooming strength indu'd  And manly grace Lilaeus who had left  The balmy fragrance of Arabia's fields  And Babylonian Tenagon expir'd  His bravest friends on ev'ry side o'erthrown  With indignation Hyperanthes view'd  And in fierce haste his dauntless arm oppos'd  To Sparta's hero Each his lance protends  But thousands rush with interposing shields  Such sacred lives all anxious to defend  Or thither Fortune urg'd the tide of war  Their term protracting for augmented fame  So when two gallies lab'ring through the foam  Present for battle their destructive beaks  The billows oft by hurricanes impell'd  With mountainous commotion dash between  And either bark in black'ning tempests veil'd  Waft from its distant foe But fiercer burn'd  Thy ardour mighty Spartan while in blood  Thy falchion rag'd unwearied Now the steeds  Of day were climbing their meridian steep  And o'er the Persian camp the shouts of war  Burst from Thermopylae Pharnuchus heard  Who from his couch beyond the Malian plain  Rous'd by the tumult in the neighb'ring tents  To aid his lord had left Thessalia's fields  With Syria Cholchis and Armenia's bands  Th' Assyrians and Chaldaeans Asia's camp  Was still the seat of terrour and despair  As in some fruitful clime which late hath known  The rage of winds and floods when now the storm  Is heard no longer and the deluge fled  Still o'er the wasted region Nature mourns  In melancholy silence through the grove  With prostrate glories lie the stately oak  And elm uprooted while the plains are spread  With fragments swept from villages o'erthrown  And round the pastures flocks and herds are cast  In weltring heaps of death so Persia's host  In horrour mute one boundless scene displays  Of desolation half devour'd by fire  Its tall pavilions and its warlike cars  Hide all the field with ruin here in gore  Its princes lie and nameless thousands there  Here legions bleeding by the Grecian steel  There Persians slain by Persians still declare  The wild confusion of the direful night  When wanting signals and their leaders care  They rush'd to mutual slaughter Xerxes' tent  On its exalted summit when the dawn  First streaks the glowing sky was wont to bear  The golden form of Mithra clos'd between  Two lucid crystals to the Barb'rous host  An awful signal all in arms to leave  Their crouded tents and numberless to wait  Their monarch's presence this Pharnuchus rears  High on the proud pavilion at the sight  Their consternation is at length dispell'd  And through th' assembling nations hope revives  Pharnuchus then from all the number forms  A chosen train Thermopylae he seeks  Their march in loudest clamours is proclaim'd  His phalanx soon Leonidas commands  To circle backward from the Malian shore  Their order changes now halforb'd they stand  By Oeta's mountains guarded from behind  With either flank united to the rock  As by th' excelling architect dispos'd  To shield some haven a stupendous mole  Fram'd of the grove and quarry's mingled strength  In ocean's bosom penetrates afar  There stands the pride of art against the weight  Of seas unmov'd and breaks the whelming surge  So when Pharnuchus with innum'rous pow'rs  Thermopylae had fill'd th' unyielding Greeks  Oppos'd the hostile deluge and its rage  Unshaken stem'd Amid the foremost rank  Leonidas his dreadful station held  Before him soon an horrid void is seen  Through Persia's legions and the proud remains  Of noblest chiefs th' insanguin'd rock bestrew  Pharnuchus glowing with revenge and wrath  Discharges full at Lacedaemon's chief  His ironstudded mace Aside it glanc'd  Turn'd by the massy shield and prone to earth  The Persian fell Alcander to the rock  Transfix'd the prostrate satrap through the reins  Himself receiving in th' unguarded side  The lance of Hyperanthes Low he lies  The only Theban who by Sparta's king  Abode intrepid and to Greece preserv'd  His faith untainted a physician sage  Who from Cithaeron each benignant herb  Was wont to gather and expatiate o'er  The Heliconian pastures where no plant  Of poison springs but such whose healing juice  Expells the venom from the viper's tooth  Fill'd with the sweetness of the soil divine  Him all who languish on the bed of pain  Him most the wretch whom want and sickness spreads  On earth's cold breast neglected shall deplore  On him the brave Artontes sinks in death  Renown'd through wide Bithynia now no more  The clam'rous rites of Cybele to share  While Echo murmurs through the hollow caves  Of Berecynthian Dindymus The hand  Of Alpheus sent him to the shades of night  E'er from the dead he disingag'd his spear  Huge Abradates glorying in his strength  Surpassing all of Cissian race advanc'd  To grapple with the victor near him now  His foremost step the Persian plants his hand  Grasps at the Spartan's shoulder Alpheus once  At Nemea's games the wrestlers crown obtain'd  His art he summons and his rapid foot  Obliquely strikes against the Persian's heel  He falling seiz'd on Alpheus' neck and drag'd  His foe upon him Streight an hundred darts  Of thronging Persia cleave the Grecian's back  To Abradates' breast the weapons pierce  And rivet both in death This Maron saw  And Polydorus who with victims fall'n  Before their vengeance hide their brother's corse  At length the gen'rous blood of Maron warms  The lance of Hyperanthes On the spear  Of Polydorus falls the pond'rous ax  Of Sacian Mardus from the yielding wood  The steely point is sever'd Undismay'd  The Spartan stoops to rear the knotted mace  Of slain Pharnuchus but thy fatal sword  Abrocomes that dreadful instant marks  To rend his op'ning side unconquer'd still  Swift he discharges on the Sacian's front  An horrid wound that reach'd the bursting brain  Down his own limbs the while a torrent flows  Of vital crimson smiling he surveys  His sorrows ending and his Spartan name  Renew its lustre Sudden to his side  Springs Dithyrambus through th' uplifted arm  Of Mindus pointing his impetuous dart  Against the bleeding Spartan he impells  His steel resistless Polydorus now  Stretch'd his cold hand to Thespia's friendly chief  Then bow'd his head in everlasting peace  And Mindus wasted by his flowing wound  Beside him faints and dies In Ninus old  Had his exalted ancestors sustain'd  Th' Assyrian scepter Now to Persia's throne  A tributary lord he rul'd the vales  Where Tigris swift between the parted hills  Of tall Niphátes draws its foaming tide  Impregnating the glebe At once a croud  Of ardent Persians seize the conqu'ror's lance  An hundred arms infold it Thespia's youth  With one strong hand maintains the struggling spear  The other bares his falchion Through his foes  With lightning wing'd it scatters wounds and death  Artáphrenes in torture feels his arm  Lopt from the shoulder Zatis leaves his hand  Yet twining round the longdisputed lance  On Pheron's neck descends the pond'rous blade  Down drops the sever'd head the vital stream  Spouts from its purple sluices Mardon strides  Across the pointed ash His weight o'ercomes  The wearied Grecian who resigns his hold  Yet cleaves th' exulting Persian to the brain  But now the fierce Abrócomes approach'd  And louring shakes his dart The wary Greek  With his broad buckler intercepts the stroke  And closes with the Persian Then what aid  Of mortal force or interposing heav'n  Preserv'd the eastern warrior Lo the friend  Of Teribazus eager to avenge  His lov'd companion and at once to guard  A brother's life beneath the sinewy arm  That instant rais'd for slaughter plung'd his lance  In Dithyrambus' side The vital strings  At once relax nor Fame nor Greece demand  More from his valour and supine he lies  In glories ripen'd on his blooming head  Him shall the Thespian virgins in their songs  Record one loveliest of the youthful train  The good the gentle generous and brave  Now fall'n his country's grace and parent's pride  So sinks the cedar which in verdant bloom  High on the top of Libanus had stood  The mountain's boast and glory of the grove  Then to adorn the mansions of the great  Or dignify some God's highvaulted fane  Uprooted low'rs its heav'naspiring head  Diomedon bursts forward Round his friend  He heaps destruction What a troop of ghosts  Attend thy shade fall'n hero Long unmatch'd  Prevail'd his vengeful arm and Persia bled  Till four Assyrians on his shelving lance  E'er yet extracted from a prostrate corse  Their pond'rous maces all discharge It broke  Yet with the truncheon of his shatter'd spear  The Greek sustains the contest Through his eye  The shiver'd fragment penetrates the brain  Of one bold warriour there the splintry wood  Infix'd remains the hero then unsheaths  His falchion broad a second views aghast  His entrails falling while Plataea's chief  From the gash'd belly draws his reeking sword  Prone sinks a third beneath the falchion's weight  Though with the furious stroke the yielding blade  Flew from the hilt and left the Greek disarm'd  The fourth that instant lifts his knotted mace  It falls resistless on the batter'd helm  And low the great Diomedon extends  His mighty limbs So weaken'd by the force  Of some tremendous engine which the hand  Of Mars impells a stately turret spreads  Its disuniting ramparts on the plain  Joy fills th' assailants while the battle's tide  Whelms o'er the widening breach The Persians thus  O'er the latefear'd Diomedon had rush'd  And swept the Greeks before them when behold  Leonidas At once their ardour froze  He had a while within the orb retir'd  Oppress'd by labour Now with strength restor'd  He pours fresh ruin from the Spartan front  As long retarded by th' unmoving calm  Soon as a rising gale freshbreathing curls  The surging main again the vessel bounds  With all her op'ning sails the hero thus  His buckler huge and formidable spear  Advancing through the Asian files renews  His course of slaughter Destiny compells  The bold Hydarnes to th' unequal fight  Who proudly vaunting left his weeping bride  To mourn his absence on the distant verge  Of Bactrian Ochus Victory in vain  He parting promis'd Wanton hope no more  Round his cold heart delusive sports nor paints  Th' imagin'd pomp of triumphs gorgeous spoils  And trains of shackled Greeks The Spartan pierc'd  His shield and bursting corselet From the slain  The victor draws his ironpointed spear  Bent and infeebled with the forceful blow  Meantime within his buckler's verge unseen  Amphistreus stealing in th' unguarded flank  His poniard struck With swift effusion gush'd  A crimson torrent but the scaly mail  Immediate death repell'd Th' indignant king  Gripes with resistless might the Persian's throat  And drags him prostrate None in Xerxes' court  Was more corrupt with insolence more base  With rancour more fallacious Phrygia pin'd  Beneath th' oppression of his ruthless sway  Was there a field once fruitful or a town  Once populous and rich The horrid change  To want and desolation there declar'd  The curs'd Amphistreus govern'd As the spear  Of Tyrian Cadmus riveted to earth  The pois'nous dragon whose infectious breath  Had blasted half Boeotia so the chief  Of Lacedaemon trampling on the neck  Of fall'n Amphistreus fixes to the rock  The gasping tyrant and his broken lance  Leaves in the panting corse Meanwhile thy wound  Incessant flows great hero and augments  The hopes of Persia Thou unyielding still  Sustain'st the contest while unnumber'd darts  Are shiver'd on thy buckler and thy feet  With glitt'ring points bestrew the Cholchian sword  And Persian dagger leave their shatter'd hilts  Bent is the Caspian scymetar in vain  The Sacian wheels his falchion and their mace  The strong Chaldaeans and Assyrians raise  Thou stand'st unshaken like a Thracian hill  Like Rhodopé or Haemus where in vain  The thund'rer plants his livid bolt in vain  The glancing lightning cleaves th' incrusted snow  And Winter beating with eternal war  Shakes from his dreery wings discordant storms  Chill sleet and clatt'ring hail But now advanc'd  Abrocomes and aim'd his deadly spear  Against the forehead of Laconia's chief  Not unperceiv'd the Spartan's active hand  His sword opposing upward rears the blade  Against the threatning javelin o'er his crest  Its fury wastes in air while swift descends  The pond'rous falchion on the Persian's knee  At once the bone is sever'd prone he falls  Crush'd on the ground beneath ten thousand feet  The gallant warriour breaths the last remains  Of tortur'd life The Spartan thus maintain'd  Th' unequal combat with his single sword  But Agis calls Diéneces alarms  Demophilus Megistias they from heaps  Of Allarodian and Sasperian slain  Haste to their leader and before him raise  The brazen bulwark of their massy shields  The foremost line of Asia stands and bleeds  The rest recoil but Hyperanthes strides  From rank to rank throughout his various host  Their dying hopes rekindles in the brave  Excites new valour and the freezing heart  Of Fear revives Astaspes first obey'd  The hero's voice a fierce Chaldaean lord  Vain of his birth from antient Belus drawn  Proud of his wealthy stores and stately domes  But now more proud by conquest since his might  Had foil'd the strong Diomedon He seeks  The front of battle His victorious mace  Against the brave Diéneces he bends  The weighty blow bore down th' opposing shield  And crush'd the Spartan's shoulder idle hangs  The buckler now and loads th' inactive arm  Depriv'd of all its functions Agis bares  His vengeful blade and severs from the foe  His hand exalted for a second stroke  The dying fingers with convulsive grasp  The falling mace infold A Sacian chief  Springs on the victor Iäxartes' banks  To this brave savage gave his name and birth  His looks erect and fierce deportment spoke  A bold and gallant spirit but untam'd  With dreery wilds familiar and a race  Of rude Barbarians horrid as their clime  The hostile spear against his forehead aim'd  Glanc'd upward and o'erturn'd his iron cone  The blow renew'd his bursting chest divides  Th' undaunted Sacian writhes along the lance  Which griding passes through his breast and back  A barbed arrow from his quiver draws  Deep in the streaming pap of Agis hides  The deadly steel then grimly smiles and dies  From him Fate hastens to a nobler prey  For lo the brave Diéneces presents  His breast obnoxious to a thousand darts  The shield deserts his unsustaining arm  And slides to earth A grove of javelins rose  On his broad bosom Still for ev'ry wound  He hurl'd a Persian to th'infernal gloom  But life at length forfook his riven heart  And o'er the rock the gasping hero stretch'd  His dying limbs in gore Who now can stand  The torrent of Barbarians Agis bleeds  His spear is irrecoverably plung'd  In Iäxartes' body Low reclines  Diéneces in gore The Spartan chief  Himself o'erlabour'd of his lance disarm'd  The rage of Death can exercise no more  One last and glorious effort age performs  Demophilus Megistias join their might  And stem the floods of conquest while the spear  Of slain Diéneces to Sparta's king  The fainting Agis bore The blazing steel  In that dire hand again for battle rear'd  Blasts all the Persian valour Back in heaps  They roll confounded by their leader's voice  In vain exhorted longer to endure  The ceaseless waste of that unconquer'd arm  So when the giants from Olympus chas'd  Th' inferiour Gods themselves in terrour shun'd  Th' incessant streams of lightning when the hand  Of heav'n's great father with eternal might  Sustain'd the direful conflict O'er the field  Awhile Bellona stills the rage of war  When Thespia's leader and Megistias drop  At either side of Lacedaemon's king  Beneath the weight of years and labour bend  The hoary warriours Not a groan molests  Their parting spirits but in death's calm night  Allsilent bows each venerable head  Like aged oaks whose deepdescending roots  Had pierc'd resistless through the mountain's side  And there for three long centuries had brav'd  Each angry gust of Eurus and the North  Till sapless now by Time's despoiling hand  Without a blast their mossy trunks recline  Before their parent hill By Sparta's chief  None now remains but Agis who implores  The last kind office from his godlike friend  The Sacian's arrow from his pap to draw  This done life issues with the sanguine tide  Thy comely features Agis now are pale  Cold are thy graceful limbs and dim thy eyes  Which now no more with placid beams reveal  The native virtues of thy gentle breast  The noble corse Leonidas surveys  Fate yields him one short interval of peace  To know how lovely are the patriot's wounds  And see those honours grace the man he lov'd  But Hyperanthes with his single spear  Forth from the trembling ranks of Asia tow'rs  His country's glory to redeem or fall  The Spartan worn by toil his languid arm  Once more uplifting waits the dauntless prince  The heroes now stood adverse Each a while  Restrain'd his valour and his godlike foe  Admiring view'd Such majesty and strength  To fierce Pelides all incircled round  With Trojan dead and such to Priam's son  By struggling virtue and by manly shame  From flight recall'd great Homer's fancy gave  O thou exalted o'er the laurel'd train  High as the sweet Calliope is thron'd  Above each vigin of the tuneful hill  Now let one beam of thy celestial light  Dart through my lab'ring mind lest Freedom mourn  Her chosen son dishonour'd in these strains  NOW Hyperanthes and Laconia's king  With brandish'd points and targets high uprear'd  Commence the fatal combat which must close  The longcontinu'd horrours of the day  Fix'd with amaze and fear the Asian files  Unmov'd and silent on their bucklers pause  Thus o'er th' expanse of India's wilds contend  The elephant and horn'd rhinoceros  Earth groans beneath them as with wrath untam'd  Each hideous bulk in dire encounter meets  With distant terrour gaze the savage throng  Prolong'd by varied art the dubious fight  The great event suspended On the foe  His wellaim'd spear at last the Spartan drove  And pierc'd the shield Inexorable fate  That moment hover'd o'er the eastern prince  When with unmatch'd celerity aside  He swung his buckler underneath his arm  Unstain'd with blood the hostile javelin pass'd  Meantime with joy and ardent hopes elate  Of fame and conquest sudden he impell'd  His rapid lance against the Spartan's throat  But he with wary skill his target rais'd  And o'er his shoulder turn'd the glancing steel  For one last effort then his scatter'd strength  Recall'd and wheeling with resistless force  His massy buckler dash'd the brazen verge  Against the Persian's forehead down he sunk  Without a groan expiring as o'erwhelm'd  Beneath a marble fragment from its seat  Heav'd by a whirlwind sweeping o'er the ridge  Of some aspiring mansion Gen'rous prince  What could his valour more His single might  He match'd with great Leonidas and fell  Before his native bands The Spartan chief  Now stands alone In heaps his slaughter'd friends  All stretch'd around him lie The distant foes  Show'r on his head innumerable darts  From various sluices gush the vital floods  And stain his fainting limbs Nor yet with pain  His brow is clouded but those beauteous wounds  The sacred pledges of his own renown  And Sparta's safety with serenest joy  His closing eye contemplates Fame can twine  No brighter laurels round his glorious head  His virtue more to labour Fate forbids  And lays him now in honourable rest  To seal his country's liberty in death  End of
