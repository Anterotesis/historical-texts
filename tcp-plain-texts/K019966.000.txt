 A LETTER TO The People of Scotland  PRICE HALFACROWN  ENTERED IN THE HALLBOOK OF THE  Company of Stationers  A LETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND ON THE ALARMING ATTEMPT TO INFRINGE THE ARTICLES OF THE UNION AND INTRODUCE A MOST PERNICIOUS INNOVATION BY DIMINISHING THE NUMBER OF THE LORDS OF SESSION  BY  JAMES BOSWELL  ESQ  Remember O my friends the laws the rights  The generous plan of power delivered down  From age to age by your renowned forefathers  O let it never perish in your hands  But piously transmit it to your children  ADDISON  LONDON PRINTED FOR CHARLES DILLY IN THE POULTRY MDCCLXXXV  A LETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND  WHEN I presumed to write to my countrymen last year to rouse their spirit against Mr  Fox's EastIndia bill  I had the happiness to find my letter received not only with indulgence but with a generous warmth of heart which I can never forget but to the latest moment of my life shall most gratefully remember The fire of loyalty was kindled It flew through our counties and our  boroughs The King was addressed the constitution was saved I was proud to have been able thus  ciere viros  prouder still than of receiving the applause of the  minister of the  CROWN which he was pleased to convey to me in a very handsome letter upon which however I set a high value considering not only the minister but the man and accordingly it shall be preserved in the archives of my family  I now feel myself called upon to to write to them again upon a subject of less magnitude indeed but of most interesting concern The crown is not in danger every day GOD forbid it should  As if Misfortune made the throne her seat  And none could be unhappy but the great  But what is the crown without subjects and what are subjects without a good administration of justice A rage for  innovation  has gone forth and that rage seconded by avarice and inordinate love of power in different parties according to their different interests hath lately threatened and still threatens us with a violent shock to our civil judicature by reducing the number of the lords of session from fifteen to ten that ten may have larger salaries This "comes home to our business and bosoms" It is a very serious alarm indeed As to the barons of Exchequer I shall say nothing It is but a modern court and we are told a person of high office in the law said they were not so much judges as revenue officers  But the  Court of Session  has a vast jurisdiction It was formed by James V of Scotland  anno  after the model of the  Parliament of Paris  It consisted originally of seven churchmen seven laymen and a prelate as president This was altered They are now all laymen and none can be appointed but who have been five years advocates or principal clerks of court or ten years clerks to his majesty's signet but advocates are almost always appointed Their gowns are of purple cloth and crimson velvet very gracefully disposed and they still retain the sacerdotal badge of a cawl or pouch which hangs on their shoulders as a part of the gown like that of the capuchins Its jurisdiction is not only supreme in Scotland  over all causes civil and consistorial that is to say causes of the nature of the ecclesiastical causes in England with this amazing difference that they have a power to give a sentence of divorce equivalent to an act of parliament but has also a considerable extent in criminal cases And let me add that it has acquired a kind of undefined arbitrary jurisdiction called its  nobile officium  for a full and bold account of which I refer you to Dr  Gilbert Stuart  I cannot but complain of the secret and sudden mode of framing and bringing forward this momentous billWhat shall the supreme civil court of a country be diminished one thirdShall an establishment sanctified  by the acquiescence of ages be pulled to pieces without any communication whatever with the subjects of that country high or low nay without ever consulting the bar the  faculty  of  advocates  that learned body who are guardians of the law  antistites justitiae  But  scandal  says Mr  Henry Dundas  has been applied to by some of the judges who after feasting at  Bayll's  French tavern and raising their spirits high with wine have formed the lofty wish of reverently paying their court to  Regina Pecunia  and Mr  Henry Dundas  sometimes called  Harry the Ninth  very willing to oblige those senators and make them his devoted humble servants has nodded assent  Egregiam sane loudem et spolia ampla refertis  But Mr Dundas not being  sure  that the people of Scotland are yet  entirely tame  has been too wise to commit  himself  in this desperate business but has only given instructions and then Mr  Ilay Campbell  the present lord advocate of Scotland whom his brethren did the honour to elect their vice dean rises in the house of commons with this same pretty little bill cut and dry and thinks he may at once kill his five men and in triumph call out "Off with their heads"So much for  Lords of Session  But let him beware he will find them "rise with gashes on their crowns to push him and others too perhaps from their stools" Like the vision in Mr  Glover's  celebrated ballad of  Hosier's Ghost  "A sad troop  will appear all shrowded in dreary robes as winding sheets and frowning on a hostile band"  But indeed indeed our country is at a miserable ebb when its great and good families are totally indifferent about every public concern and have so little spirit even as to their private concerns that they never advance like men to the fountain head of government but indolently or timidly suffer all to be done by some person or other who for the time is brought forward or who puts himself forward as a  minister for Scotland  They are afraid to let their  natural voice  be heard by administration but must convey their wishes through a speaking trumpet which I will tell them  may be pointed high or low as he who holds it may think proper But if the Stuarts the Hamiltons the Erskines the Craufurds the Montgomeries the Douglases the Grahams the Somervilles the Cathcarts the Kennedies in short all the men of blood and of property who ought to be men of consequence hang back are we to be surprized that administration appoints a  locum tenens  an agent or by whatever name he may be called or that some able and ardent politician takes their place I remember  Archibald  duke of  Argyll  I remember  Stuart Mackenzie  I remember  Gilmour  all in their turn  bowed  to and bringing the people of Scotland to St James's and the Treasury as a salesman drives black  cattle to Smithfield Poor dumb beasts why should they not walk up themselves and bellow as they may incline  I'll bellow out for Rome and for my country  And mouth at Caesar till I shake the Senate  Then came Mr  Henry Dundas  who has made a distinguished figure at more markets than onewhether at  Oxford  market with Lord  North  or  Leadenhall  market with Mr  Pitt  There was a time when we were flattered there was to be no monopoly when that TITUS that  Deliciae humani generis  the Duke of  Portland  I give his Grace as Mr Burke gave him me not having the good fortune to be known to him when  He  presided O then all was to go well  with ScotlandThere was to be no gobetweennobody to keep back the individuals of that distant part of the island from fairly asserting their pretensions whether from birth wealth or merit But alas we soon found there was only a  change of Dundases  Instead of Mr  Henry Dundas  we got Sir  Thomas Dundas  and now we have Mr  Henry Dundas  again  Mr Dundas is of a great law race The family of  Arniston  has for four successive generations been judges in our supreme civil court and for these two last been at the head of it as PresidentA very extraordinary instance in modern times where it can be said  per fasces numerat avos  Why then O why Mr Dundas  should  you  attempt to injure this ancient institution Are you not afraid that the shades of your ancestors may disturb your pillow "Be not too bold" I intreat you There are some things which we will bear and some things which we will  not  bear Think O think of  "Vaulting Ambition which o'erleaps itself"  Besides Sir you are the Dean of the Faculty of Advocates We have placed you in the chair where LOCKHART sat we expect you will not betray us  But that I may now speak to my countrymen in plain and I flatter myself convincing argument let us consider the peculiar form and constitution of the Court of Session It  will hardly be believed in  England  that we have no juries in civil causes still more strange will it seem that we once had that inestimable privilege and lost itnobody can tell how But Lord  Kames  has proved itThat a country should in the progress of civilization in every other respect become more barbarous in its executive jurisprudence is a wonderful and a disgraceful phaenomenon Nay we have no grand jury in Scotland There is no such thing as finding a bill by the country all criminal prosecutions are by  information  of the first crown lawyer or by immediate indictment at the suit of private persons with his concurrence so that there is neither the security against unjust prosecutions which the verdict of our peers would  afford nor is there a certainty that crimes which  ought  to be prosecuted  will  be prosecuted All is left to the will and pleasure of  His Majesty's Advocate  the AttorneyGeneral of Scotland that anomalous personage whose  status  puzzles the House of Commons who is a  lord  but yet not  noble  and tomorrow may descend to be only the honourable or ascend to be the right honourable  gentleman  Plac'd on this isthmus of a middle state  A being darkly wise and rudely great  The Lord Advocate of Scotland has the whole power of a grand jury in his person The fat Mr  Edward Bright  of Malden whose print is in all our inns to amuse the weary traveller is nothing to the  learned lord    He  could button seven men in his  waistcoat but the learned lord comprehends hundreds the grand juries of thirty counties are packed within his little circumference  The Court of Session then is not only a body of  judges  but like the Parliament of Paris it is a standing  jury  for all Scotland And will it be seriously maintained that  fifteen  is too large a number when that is considered My amiable and honourable friend  Dempster  that  rara avis  of the Scottish breed who has sat in parliament almost as long as our present most gracious Sovereign has sat upon the throne and has shewn himself uniformly independent uniformly benevolent when I talked to him upon this subject exclaimed  Fifteen  too few I would rather have fifty They talk of there being only twelve judges in England I say there are twenty thousandthe juriesby whom almost every thing is decided and our fifteen Lords of Session are all we have for a jury in civil causes  Nobly said There  are  twenty thousand judges in England  judges of law as well as of fact  and I hope in GOD there ever shall be notwithstanding all that the old Conjuror or any of his pupils can do While a  Loft  and a  Towers  can write and a  Lee  and an  Erskine  plead that sacred palladium will be preserved  If the British Parliament will give us a grand jury and juries in civil  causes for both of which if I am ever thought worthy of being sent into the House of Commons as an independent gentleman I shall certainly move for leave to bring in a bill I will answer for it that the people of Scotland when deliberately consultedas they ought to be in justice in propriety and in common decency will cheerfully agree to have the number of the Lords of Session diminished because they would  then  have something better than their ancient aristocratical court And with exultation I can tell that so far as the people of Scotland  can  in the limited privilege of Juries which they havethey do now exercise their constitutional right in its full extent We have a  Smellie  who has with a  calm but an undaunted spirit pointed it out to his fellow citizens in a well written discourse and a few months ago  William Spence  a young matross for whom I was counsel was indicted by the Lord Advocate for felonious  fireraising  He was prosecuted by his lordship in person with all his address and the Lord Justice Clerk the Vice President of the High Court of Justiciary gave a charge with all his his ability to find him guilty But a respectable jury acquitted him and  as I hope for mercy from the Judge of all the earth  had I been one of their number I should have been clear to join in the verdict I will give up my own opinion to no human authority  In the present form and constitution of the Court of Session there is occasion for at least the full number of judges which were at first appointed and which has remained undiminished now for  two hundred and fifty three years  It is remarkable that when James V instituted the court the number of the judges was thought small Take the words of  Buchanan Hist  lib cap  Joannes Dux Albinus a pontifice Romano impetravit ut summa pecuniae annua quanta satis esset ad  paucorum  judicum salarium solvendum imperaretur ecclesiastico ordini universo a singulisque pro modò census exigeretur  He tells us it was difficult to obtain money for salaries even to those  few  so much  stronger  then  too was the love of money than the love of justiceand he sternly delivers his opinion that the institution did not produce the good that was expected from it  Omnium civium bona  quindecim  hominum arbitrio sunt commissa quibus et perpetua est potestas et imperium plane tyrannicum  The  perpetua potestas  is the grievance of a  standing jury  and the  imperium plane tyrannicum  must in the nature of things reside in a body of men who possess at once the province of judge and of jury nay of common law judges and equity judges who are both King's Bench and Chancery and whose decisions therefore may be a compound of law and of fact and of  equity as its members may be differently moved  It is this which makes it of infinite consequence to us to preserve all the judges we have as long as the court retains the same constitution for it has been found in practice that notwithstanding the staggering objections to it in theory this same court of fifteen has been so balanced and mixed and tempered and mellowed by the workings of various qualities in the course of time that upon the whole it has done very well  There may to be sure come a DOUGLAS CAUSE which is too vast an object for the throw of such a complicated die  Non nostrum est tantas componere lites  That is not much  because for great causes we have an appeal to that august tribunal the House of Lords But as the expence of an appeal is more than the value of almost every cause that the court of session decides the right of appeal is nothing to the greatest number of our suitorsWe are therefore concerned that  Innovation  should be prevented as we may fear but cannot foresee its effects and as the  imperium  of the court would be still more  tyrannicum  in ten than in fifteen as spirits have more force as they are more compressed by distillation  Our ancestors took care to have it solemnly stipulated in the  th article of the Union  That the  Court of  Session  or College of Justice do after the Union and notwithstanding thereof  remain in all time coming  within Scotland  as it is now constituted  by the laws of that kingdom and with the same authority and privileges as before the Union subject nevertheless to such  regulations for the better administration of Justice  as shall be made by the Parliament of GreatBritain  Is it possible think you by any artifice of words by any little quirk of any sort to explain away this article and to maintain that the excepted power to  make regulations for the better administration of justice  in a  court  which is to  remain in all time coming as now constituted  shall be  understood to give a licence to destroy that very court itself by  changing  its  constitution  Is a court of  ten  the same with a court of  fifteen  Is a  twolegged  animal the same with a  fourlegged  animal I know nobody who will gravely defend that proposition except one grotesque 'philosopher whom ludicrous  fable  represents as going about avowing his hunger and wagging his tail fain to become cannibal and eat his deceased brethren It is  clear  that the  substance  must be preserved though the  accidents  may be varied The  Court of Session  the  Quindecem Homines  must remain unless  by consent of the people of Scotland themselves  though the proceedings of the court the modes of administrating justice by those  fifteen  may  be regulated occasionally as the British Parliament in its great wisdom shall see fit If any man can entertain a doubt of  this  if he is capable of having his understanding so perverted I cannot argue with him  Is it a light matter then to infringe the  Articles of the Union  My countrymen hear me I accost you with a warning voiceHave a careI myself do fairly acknowledge that I venerate and love the ancient Hierarchy though like  Whitefield  of whose pious and animated society I had some share I can communicate with all sincere Christians But you in general think differently and your  kirk  your Presbyterian establishment stands just upon the same ground of security  that the Court of Session does No doubt it may be abolished by universal consent or by consent of a majority of  the people of Scotland  for that is my firm opinion of the import of the articles of the Union But the  British Parliament  cannot abolish it for the British Parliament  sits under those very articles  and is limited by them But once yield the  principle  were it in the smallest iota and there is an end of your security  I shall take leave to press upon you the apprehension of what I believe we shall all agree in resisting I mean that if the articles of Union should be infringed there might then most probably be a prodigious  innovation  in our  landtax  And this concerns  not  Scotland  aloneMy lords and gentlemen of the  English  counties where the landtax is low  on you I call  If Innovation is thus to stride at large the  equalizing system  may be extended and let me tell you it is not  you  that can prevent it You are too few It is to  Scotland  you owe your safety Government at present  dare  not equalize the landtax  Scotland  would rise to a man and assert the articles of the Union But the  praefervidum ingenium Scotorum  may be subduedThere is a melancholy gradation in the old song of  Waly waly up the bank  I leaned my back unto an oak  I thought it had been a trusty tree  But first it  bowed  and then it  brake  And so did my true love to me  Let not the Scottish spirit be bowed Let LOWTHER come forth and support us We are his neighbours  Paries proximus ardet  We all know what HE can do HE upon whom the thousands of  Whitehaven  depend for three of the elements HE whose soul is all greatwhose resentment is terrible but whose liberality is boundless I know that he is dignified by having hosts of enemies But I have fixed his character in my mind upon no slight inquiry I have traversed  Cumberland  and  Westmoreland  I have sojourned at  Carlisle  and at  Kendal  I know of the LONSDALE CLUB at  Lancaster  LOWTHER be kindly intreated  Come over to Macedonia and help us  Innovation  is in my mind a very perilous experiment I respect the ancient Barons for their  Nolumus leges Angliae mutari  and now that  Dr Johnson  is gone to a bettr world I bow the intellectual knee to  Lord Thurlow  who with inflexible wisdom stops the tide of fashionable reform It was  Johnson  who confirmed me in my opinion of that mighty Sage of the law and the constitution Before his promotion to the high office for which he seems to have been formed on purpose the Doctor said of him  I honour  Thurlow  Sir  Thurlow  is a fine fellow He fairly puts his mind to your's  Long long may he put his mind against those who would take even one stone out of that venerable  fabrick which is the wonder of the world  Mistake me not my countrymen as if I had changed my opinion against the  nominal and fictitious votes  in our counties  These  are no part of our old constitution They are modern tricks invented by cunning lawyers to cheat the  real Freeholders  These will I hopethese  shall  be abolished While I would sacredly guard the constitution I would sweep from it the cobwebs with all their vermin  Innovation  frightens me because I never can be sure what will come next  Hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed  is not for  mortals to say My Lord  Marchmont  did me the honour of a visit a few years ago and made a remark which still vibrates in my ear  Sir this country has been governed by wise men and we have had no notion what mischief fools could do  At another time talking of this very subject of lessening the number of judges in Scotland which has been formerly mooted his lordship said  No It must not be Scotland is far from the sun of government and must be lighted by many lustres    "There the bright flame was shot through Marchmont's foul"  The present attempt puts me in mind of one of the many good stories  which I have heard my father tell An Earl of  Seaforth  took it into his head that he would pull down  Bran  castle the ancient seat of his family The  clan  was alarmed The  caperfey  the deer's head the crest of the Mackenzie's was displayed The brave  Mackenzies  took fire assembled and came to him in a body  My lord this shall not be Wiser men than you built this castle You shall not demolish it    There  was the true spirit of clanship not a slavish subjection to an individual but a voluntary attachment to their patriarchal father and lordto the family to the throne  I abhor annihilationand five of our judges shall not perish if I can  prevent itWhat in the name of goodness is the motive to this violent measure Does the country complain that there are too many judges NoDo the judges themselves complain I trust NoFor what I pray you is the Court of Session Why it is an aggregate of  fourteen  separate and distinct subordinate courts and one Court of Appeal There are fourteen  ordinary lords  Each of these has his own roll of causes in one half of which his judgement is allowed to be final The Court of Appeal is the whole body of those  Lord Ordinaries  with the Lord President at their head and this Court of Appeal sits five days in the week to review judgments of the  Ordinaries  Now let us consider  how business is done in this court or more properly speaking in these courts It is done chiefly in writing and most voluminous writing it is there are  minutes representations answers replies duplies triplies memorials hinc indecum multis aliis que nunc  perscribere  longum est  so that each  process  as the papers in a suit are called makes a thick bundle which is carried to the judge's house and this he must peruse and afterwards put his  interlocutor  upon it in writing and authenticate it by his subscription Now I  know  and every man acquainted with the court knows and  it can be proved by all the members of the College of Justice  that it is with the utmost difficulty that even the fourteen judges whom we have  can get through the business with reasonable dispatch How is it possible then that it can be done by a third fewer people be they ever so laborious Nine Dukes of  Richmond  could not do it  I could see some meaning in diminishing the  Court of Review  and letting only the  ten  senior judges or perhaps the  five  senior judges sit in the  Inner House  that the Court of Review might move quicker by being less unwieldy and the other judges might have more time to ripen and decide causes in the first instance which is the most laborious part of the business  That  I could understand as coming within the power conceded in the articles of Union to  make  regulations  But to make  the labourers few when the harvest truly is great  seems to me to be very strange policy  And here I have an  argumentum ad homines  I  will not believe  that the Lords of Session themselves are so unconscientious as to approve of this measure though  Rumour  with all her tongues has wantonly said they are for it My argument is this There is not one of them who has not again and again said what I have just now stated that the duty of his office is very great and that in sessiontime he is quite harrassed he has so much to doWill they then undertake to do more that they may get a little more money I hope not  As it must be  sure  that they are  perfectly innocent  of so heavy a charge I may put it in strong words  Either they  have  been  liars  or They  mean  to be  cheats  That is the infamous charge which their approbation of lessening their number without lessening or shortening the business of the court would involveI beg ten thousand pardons for even uttering such coarse epithets but my indignation is roused that any creature whatever should have the audacity to impute to the judges of my country so abominable an alternative  Quid non mortalia pectora cogis auri sacra fames  is an exclamation which keeps pace with mankind from age to age But surely we ought to  suppose judges have learnt better things and have extirpated from their hallowed breasts  the root of all evil  How injurious is it to imagine they will be like some impudent sluts who for more wages will undertake to be both cookmaid and chambermaid  Delicate coalition  The Lords of Session are or should be Gentlemen Shall we make them a parcel of  Scrubs    Of a Monday I drive the coach of a Tuesday I drive the plough on a Wednesday I follow the hounds a Thursday I dun the tenants on Friday I go to market on Saturday I draw warrants and a Sunday I draw beer  Suppose it should be thought right to increase the salaries of the Lords of  Session is there no way of doing it but making twothirds of them devour the rest like Pharaoh's lean and fat kine Is the state so poor that we must adopt a measure similar to the barbarous permission in China and Otaheite to murder their children lest they should not have food enough Six thousand pounds a year would make them up £ each and cannot that miserable sum be spared off some corner of the sinecure establishment I persuade myself that the people of Scotland themselves would submit to a  census  in order to ransom their court If the Judges are poor let them hold out  the Mendicant pouch  and receive our  benevolence  I for one would cheerfully pay my  quota  rather than suffer  so dangerous an amputation to be botchingly performed upon our old judicial body  But is it quite clear that there should be an augmentation of their salaries The Lord President has already £ a year every Ordinary Lord has better than  six hundred guineas  and six of their number are also Lords of Justiciary of whom the Lord Justice Clerk has £ a year and each of the other five has £ a year Besides every one of those six is allowed £ a year for circuit expences and now that they have obtained an act of Parliament allowing them to stay only three days at each assizetown instead of six as they were formerly obliged to do  while the  same allowance for expences is quietly continued  they have upon my word very comfortable provisions The Justiciary gown is an excellent object of ambition and an encouragement for laudable exertion to the Ordinary Lords But even without that they have a very decent premium from the state and may live very well in  Scotland  as judges should live  not in rioting and drunkenness  indeed but in grave abstraction as becomes their office Dr  South's  pulpit joke upon the wages of sin being death  Poor wages that a man cannot live by  will not in my opinion apply to  all  offices The state in many cases is only to help a man to live not wholly to support him The state should enable him fully to defray  the additional expence occasioned by the office which he holds but he is a hungry hound indeed who comes into an office of respect and experience such as that of a judge with nothing at all of his own neither family estate nor fortune acquired by practice I own I should think a man in such circumstances ought not to be made a judge either his birth must be meanhis abilities small or his conduct imprudent  Were there a difficulty to find men of merit willing to be made Lords of Session by reason of the salary being too small I could understand this  procrustian  expedient but let us at least wait till that is the case which well Mr  Dundas  knows it is not as  yet by any means Will he tell me that the salary of that office is not sufficiently considerable for which Mr  Alexander Gordon  brother to the Earl of Aberdeen uncle to the Duke of Gordon and a man of good understanding experience and integrity solicited for years and  pudet haec opprobria  might perhaps have been soliciting still had not a political wave in the tempest of last year thrown him into portAn office desired by Mr  John Maclaurin filius Colini fama super  aethera  noti  and a son of no common talentsAn office which would be accepted by Mr  William Nairne  our ViceDean whose character truly exhibits a heavenborn judgeAn office which would comfort which would satisfy Mr  George  Wallace  whose knowledge application and honesty none will deny whom Lord  Mansfield  has praised but not promoted  Laudatur et alget  I could with pleasure give a long list of my deserving brethren To us it is  not fair  It is  unjust  to lessen the number of prizes after the lottery has begun drawing after we by an expensive education and much time and labour have purchased our tickets in the faith that our chance for a prize is to be what it ever has been As for myself I do most certainly believe that I am now writing from pure motives because I have at present no wish for the serious and important office of a Lord of Session I have a confidence  perhaps too great a confidence in my abilities and therefore will try my fortune for some time at least in a wider sphere But this I declare that though the situation seems to me too confined I never thought the salary too small  Let us be cautious of augmenting the salaries of our judges Judges like men of genius and learning  nutriendi sunt non saginandi  A  gown  in Scotland should not be too good a  place  lest it become altogether an object of political preferment We have already several noble lords who are of the Faculty of Advocates and who might perhaps condescend to take such a loaf Lord  Salton  might think it a  snug thing  My cousin  Lord  Cathcart  might see it to be  better than a regiment  Lord  Stair  might  add  it to his  finances  Lord  Cassillis  might chuse it by way of  otium cum dignitate  And the gentlemen whom I have mentioned with an  Erskine  a  Blair  an  Abercrombie  a  Grant  a  Cullen  and all the rest who have honourably borne the heat of the day might languish and die without ever obtaining that rank to which they will in justice be entitled  Take the Scottish Bench as it is now endowedtake it in a pecuniary view It is a  tontine  for our sons In no country in Europe but Scotland is the profession of the law an  etat  a rank Many a gentleman with us enters advocate merely to have a feather  in his cap The prime society of Edinburgh is lawyers  They  give the tone as  arbitri elegantiarum they  rule the theatre  They  make balls for the ladies and once I suppose to shew the prodigious extent of their power they let the nation know that they could proscribe even a beautiful Duchess the very soul of gay festivity  Black law black  is the common dress of the gentlemen of Edinburgh by choice as at Geneva and Lucca by an oeconomical regulation of the state a sumptuary law and hence when  Foote  was amongst us he used to call  black  the  Edinburgh hunt  It exalts our gentlemen to think they may be judges as by calculation it has been found that there are two  vacancies for every three years They are continually looking upwards  Os homini sublime dedit coelumque tueri  Jussit et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus  I must speak plain and say that I fear this crude scheme of diminishing the number of the Lords of Session has something in it more dangerous than you are aware of  More is meant than meets the ear  A politician's lust of power is exorbitant If he can but have the supreme tribunal of Scotland of his own forming what may he not do To say nothing of our  property  it is now very well understood that the whole  political interest  of Scotland is in the hands of the Lords of Session for they ascertain the validity of all the votes  whether in our counties or in our boroughs and when we afterwards bring our contested elections before a committee of the House of Commons we have the mortification to find that Mr  Grenville's  bill is to us on the north of the Tweed as if it were not In vain do we plead in vain do we press upon the committee the absurdity the gross iniquity of an  interlocutor  A resolute  Caledonian Nominee  tells them the case has been decided by the  only competent court  which statutes have invested with the exclusive power of trying votesand honest  John Bull  believes this and acquiesces never considering that the great law of parliament the inherent right of the House of Commons to judge of the qualifications of its own members  must ever be paramount to the jurisdiction of particular subordinate courtsI am sorry Mr  George Byng  that I cannot appeal to you at present as a Member of Parliament for the truth of what I am maintaining For though I differ from you in my political creed as far as the east is from the west I think you an useful and active watchman of the state And I am never unmindful of your civility to me as a counsel when you sat Chairman of the Ayrshire Committee But you may tell your friends who are in parliament and Messieurs  Dudley Long Praed Bankes Duncombe  and several more who were of that committee will remember the piteous tale  I should oppose any diminution whatever of the number of the Lords of Session because it would make "the law's delay" be more grievously felt but above all I dislike this particular plot to revive the  Decemviri  It is  ominous  In the words of  Livy  I will say  Non placere nomen periculosum libertati esse  Who  seconded the King's Advocate's motion for leave to bring in this billthis odious bill of pains and penaltiesIt was Sir  Adam Fergusson  a man who has vexed me not a little by his political success in our county against my wishes He is one whom Mr Dundas has selected to hold up as an instance of the plenitude of his power  Do any of you want to be informed of Mr Henry Dundas's power I dare say not Care is taken that its full extent shall be proclaimed as far as  Orkney  Yet let us contemplate a striking instance it would make a picture for the exhibition or a scene at  Astley's  Behold him in your Metropolis which the death of Sir  Lawrence Dundas  left open to himWith his  right  hand he has moved the LORD PROVOST  Hunter Blair  gold chain and all from his political baseWith his  left  he has thrust in as  representative of the citizens of Edinburgh  Whoma respectable merchant NoA prosperous tradesman NoA  Coutts  the father of the great establishment in the Strand London NoA  Kerr  whom  Pelham  loved NoA citizen of any sort good bad or indifferent No No NoWhom then Why Sir  Adam Fergusson advocate  the  late  member for the  county of Ayr  Sir Adam Fergusson wrote a circular letter against peers interfering in our county election and several very worthy gentlemen joined the standard of  independency  as they imagined which he erected Carrying them along with him and yet "having his peers as well as we" he contrived to possess for two parliaments the representation of Ayrshire by means of  those superiority votes  which that county has declared to be  nominal and fictitious  while the REAL INTEREST was unrepresented Sir Adam Fergusson last year  as we are told  made overtures to the  Earl  of Eglintoune  and formed a  coalition  with his lordship That he was  not elected  we  know  that he  voted for his former opponent  we  know  and  it is said  he supports the earl's friend for one parliament and the earl is to make him member next parliament  When the report of this curious agreement burst upon the county like a bomb and stunned men of all parties I made the following Bellman's rhimes to usher in my friend Colonel Hugh Montgomerie as our representative  Adam too long you've kept your seat  With little for your pains  Trust me  you'll  never make ends meet  Computing loss and gains  Surrender then to gallant Hugh  It truly will be best  Bring your mock votes along with you  And laugh at all the rest  Thus Ayrshire yet may prosperous be  With such a brave Commander  And if  you're  pleased  our  joy to see  That  will  indeed  be  candour  THE REAL INTEREST    if he can  I have never heard his lordship say that this report is true but if it is the noble earl must not take it amiss if some of the best friends of his family should disdain what they think degrading to him and feel obnoxious to themselves Amongst those friends I myself am one of the warmest both as an enthusiast for ancient feudal attachments and as having the honour and happiness to be married to his lordship's relation a true  Montgomerie  whom I esteem whom I love after fifteen years as on the day when she gave me her hand But I have an objection to Sir Adam Fergusson on account of a paltry money question which being now under the arbitration of three of our Lords of Session I forbear to exhibit  it till the result is knownMr  Macadam  of  Craigengillan  as able and as spirited a man as any in his Majesty's dominions and Sir  John Whitefoord  who is honour itself both gentlemen of extensive interest in Ayrshire have also objections to him which they have stated to me and will tell any body who thinks it worth while to ask themIn these circumstances the House of Eglintoune can hardly expect that the great county of Ayr the Yorkshire of Scotland will be brought implicitly to wheel and vote for sir Adam Fergusson merely that a bargain which should never have been made may be fulfilled I myself have reason to hope that many of the real freeholders of Ayrshire will support me  at the election for next parliament against which I have declared myself a candidate Colonel  Montgomerie  has had the great honour of being chosen by the real Freeholders May I not have it in my turn  Ed anche Io son pittore  By the time this parliament is over he may be content to be  Vejanius armis Herculis ad postem fixis  I shall certainly stand upon the substantial interest of the gentlemen of landed property and if upon a fair trial I should not succeed in  that object of ambition which I have most ardently at heart  I have resources enough to prevent me from being discontented or fretful Perhaps Sir Adam Fergusson may support me Why should he not I know of no objection the honourable baronet can  have to me though I am sorry that I have an objection to the honourable baronet I have asked his vote and interest by a letter His answer has neither granted nor refused my application He waves it on the common civil ground that it is too soon to decide In the mean time I shall endeavour to deserve the support of the real freeholders by exerting myself as much as I possibly can to serve either the county in general or individuals of it and when a man does the best he can he may perhaps have his reward But this countrycity member has led me off from Edinburgh to which I now return and I do say that if issuing an effectual  congé d'elire  by which Sir Adam Fergusson is made member for the  capital of Scotland be not power with a witness I am at a loss to conceive what power is  As to all this power assumed by Mr Dundas I must say  miror  But I certainly do not blame  him  As  Cato  says when his gallant son  Marcus  is brought in  dead  Who would not be that youth  The proverb says  A living dog is better than a dead lion  What then must a living lion be But under what  genus  under what  species  are they to be ranked whose pusillanimity is the cause that this lion alone domineers in the forest Our late and present situation brings to my remembrance some verses in an old poem which I have heard my father repeat they are a kind of imprecation  applicable to a  coalition  which in the last age took place in  Scotland  May also these men of many wiles  Ambages  May eke thae men o' mony wimples  Sir James and Sir John Dalrymples  With  Wi' their new allies the Dundases  Rule  All  aw our lords and lairds like asses  Yet I will do Mr Dundas the justice to declare that large as his power is he has not much abused it He has indeed taken very good care of his relations And why should he not Though to be sure flesh and blood must feel his having put his young nephew over the heads of I know not how many of us as Solicitor General But I do not believe that he has been cruel oppressive or vindictive I know but of two wrong  things that he has done One was attacking Sir Lawrence Dundas in the county of Orkney  in his own manour where he was a father to the people  as that hospitable that splendid that imperial baronet said to me with tears in his eyes The other was persuading my honoured father a venerable judge in the decline of his life to embark in county politicks from which he had ceased for twenty years and make a parcel of unsubstantial votes which he abhorred in order to support Sir Adam Fergusson in Ayrshire against the old and the real interest of the county But both these instances were the effects of  politicks  which I see to be  poison to the mind  I have therefore no more objection to Mr Dundas's  being sole  Protector  of Scotland than any other man if we  must  be so ruled Nay I have an  interest  that  he  should be the person For there is an hereditary friendship between our families We were at college together We have oft enjoyed  The "happier hour  "Of social pleasure"  And I trust to the generosity of his feelings that as he  knows  he once did me a severe injury which I have from my heart forgiven he will be anxious to make me full amends if ever it shall be in his power The desire of elevation is as keen in me as in himself though I am not so well fitted for party exploits  As  Nero  wished that the people of Rome had but one neck that he might if he pleased cut them off at a single strokeSo a deep an artful politician will be desirous to contract the body which he wishes to command It is easier driving four horses in hand than six Besides while there are  fifteen  judges the danger that they may not be all tractable is proportionally multiplied when compared with the number  ten  There may be a proud an eloquent  Alemoor  who will watch like a dragona sturdy  Elliock  who will not bend a firm  Stonefield  who not only has a will of his own but if one in high place trusting that he is sheltered in his situation presumes to be coarsely insolent can tell it him in  his ear aye and to his beard an honourable  Rockville  who being of higher rank than any of them before he became a judge will not stoopwill not trucklewill not be ledbut will deliver his own honest good sense with the mild dignity that becomes him  It is very agreeable to consider that one bad judge cannot contaminate a number who are good yet when we take the converse of the proposition we shall find one good judge can prevent the evil of many bad ones He can hold up truth and justice so conspicuously that bad judges have not hardiness enough to turn aside from them and if they should he can alarm the country  When a man of probity and spirit a Lord  Newhall  whose character is ably drawn in prose by the late Lord President  Arniston  father of the Treasurer of the Navy and elegantly in verse by Mr  Hamilton  of  Bangour  when such a man sits among our judges should they be disposed to do wrong he can make them hear and tremble My honoured father told me that Sir  Walter Pringle  "spoke as one having authority" even when he was at the bar "He would cram a "decision down their throats"  Duncan Forbes  of  Culloden  when Lord President of the Court gave every day as a toast at his table  Here's to every Lord of Session who does not deserve to be hangedl  Lord  Auchinleck  and Lord  Monboddo  both judges but  since his time  are my authority for this I do not say that the toast was very delicate or even quite decent but it may give some notion what sort of judges there  may  be It is well known that  Forbes  by the single weight of his character assiduously and boldly urged made a very great alteration to the better upon the court and shewed  Unum Hominem pluris valuisse quam Civitatem  A number of judges taken from different parts of the country diffuses and divides that private and imperceptible influence which must ever be in a narrow country One prejudice is checked and counterbalanced by  another A judge from the north of the Tay is corrected by a judge from the south of the Tay and is again corrected by him in his turnI solemnly declare I mean no reflection against the Lords of Session farther than that they are not exempted from the frailties incident to manthat human nature is human nature every where and in a narrow country is more liable than in a great country to what I shall callhonest bias  With a plausible appearance it has been propagated from company to company that were there fewer Lords of Session there would be more security from their responsibility as disgrace which is light when shared amongst a number falls heavy upon  a fewBut against this you shall have an unanswerable argument  If they are honest and honourable men they will not be the less so that they are  fifteen  If they are not and mean to do wrong a junto of  ten  can do it with more facility  Non meus hic sermo est  I owe it to Lord  Palmerston  from whose conversation there is always something to be borrowed I humbly thank his lordship for it and beg he may pardon my imperfect report of it He gave it me at Lord  Ossory's  I cannot refrain from mentioning the  place  because I am very vain to fit at the table of  FITZPATRICK  the respect for whose ancient and noble blood is not lessened but increased by the character of its present representative  which as I feel is saying a great deal I flatter myself FITZPATRICK was convinced If he wasI'll answer for it all the world shall not make him flinch  And now my countrymen let me intreat you to assemble again in your counties and boroughs and corporations and publick bodies of every kind and  petition Parliament  against diminishing the number of the Lords of Session unless Parliament will totally alter the judicial procedure of Scotland upon some wise plan  after it has received your approbation  I would also have you to address the KING against so alarming a measure It is the glory of the reign of GEORGE III that he has given independency  to his judges His Majesty will graciously listen to what you humbly and honestly tell him relative to what he has much at heartthe good administration of justice in his dominions  Do not despond and imagine that  English  Members of Parliament will be totally inattentive to what so much concerns you My old classical companion  Wilkes  with whom I pray you to excuse my keeping company he is so pleasant did indeed once tell me when I asked him to attend a Scottish contest in the House of Commons  No no Damn it Not I I'll have nothing to do with it I care not which prevails It is only  Goth  against  Goth  But he is now  an older member of the great council of the nation and I hope will not grudge to take a little trouble for you by way of  doing penance  for his  biting  and  scratching  in the  North Briton  You may hope for aid from the Lord Rector of the university of Glasgow Mr  Burke  who dislikes and dreads reform in parliament who spoke this very session against it like an angel and whose benignant heart will feel for your just anxiety To Mr Burke I was much obliged when he was in power and it grieved me that he embraced what in all sincerity I thought such a measure as justified his removal from officefor his interest is dear to me as my own By his removal the King's administration  was deprived of the assistance of that affluent mind which is so universally rich that as long as British literature and British politicks shall endure it will be said of  Edmund Burke "Regum equabat opes animis  "  You will be listened to by my gallant Colonel  James Wortley Stuart  who for sterling good sense information discernment honour and honesty and spirit is not exceeded by any of them As diminishing the number of our judges would diminish the influence of the Crown he probably will not like it  You will be listened to by that brave  Irishman  I have always stood up for the Irish in whose fine country I have been hospitably and jovially entertained and with whom I feel myself to be much congenial In my  Tour to Corsiea  after relating from General  Paoli  a remarkable instance of bravery in  Carew  an  Irish  Officer at the siege of  Tortona  I thus do generous justice to the  Irish  in opposition to the  English  and  Scots    It is with pleasure that I record an anecdote so much to the honour of a gentleman of that nation on which illiberal reflections are too often thrown by those of whom it little deserves them Whatever may be the rough jokes of  wealthy Insolence  or the envious sarcasms of  needy Jealousy  the  Irish  have ever been and will continue to be highly regarded upon the continent  My book was first published in The Irish were then still under a cloud What a glorious day has burst upon them now  Quod felix faustumque sit  Captain  Macbride  the  cousin of my Wife and the friend of my heart a man whose valour has resounded in so many parts of the ocean and whose seat in parliament has not been purchased by bribery  of servility but given him by a  free election  He has come into the House of Commons borne upon the swelling bosoms of the worthy electors of  Plymouth  who knowing him best are the best judges of his merit and have been most eager to reward it by a triumphant testimony such as heroes were honoured with in old Rome  I think you may also depend upon Mr  Lee  with whom my intimacy has been chiefly formed since I made him dangle at the end of a rope as Attorney General in my EastIndia letter What liberality of mind must he haveThough he is not such a  bigot  as I am and would be glad to have  some  reform in Parliament yet I  dare say when he is made acquainted with the state of this case he will manfully oppose the attempt I love Mr  Lee  exceedingly though I believe there are not any two specifick propositions of any sort in which we exactly agree But the general mass of sense and sociality literature and religion in each of us produces two given quantities which unite and effervesce wonderfully well To his great reputation as a barrister my voice can add nothing but he has kindly enabled me to bear testimony to his private worth I know few men I would go farther to serve than  Jack Lee  Have confidence in Sir  Matthew White Ridley  that stately that pleasing  Northumbrian who exhibits an instance of what it is strange should be rareindependent opulence He was a General in the late tumultuous parliament army He fought he encouraged and he cheered with a  Fight on my merry men all  till his wisdom and his tenderness for his country prevailed over his pride and he was the first to sall back and give the signal for retreat If my sanguine hope has not deceived me Sir  Matthew  will be for us  I even think it possible that you may be protected by the MANI will not say  of the People  for I am too much in earnest to fill my mouth with party cant  Away away with blue and buff  And all such wretched foolish stuff  The time's "pale cast" which "  JOHNSON in his Dictionary has  TO SI'CKLY  v a  from the adjective To make diseased to taint with the hue of disease Not in use  But it  shall  be in use It is a word of power We cannot do without it  sicklies" you  Demands a gravea solemn hue  But I will say the man of great of extraordinary abilitiesof most extensive of infinite political knowledge who  can  do much good if he  will  and we may hope he  shall  when the adjustment of circumstances above my reach will let him Yes my friends Mr  Fox  may protect you His clear understanding can at once distinguish between a Reform which promises some beneficial consequence and a Demolition which it is demonstrated must be ruinous  And shall we be so unjust to the  Minister of the  CROWN to the second WILLIAM PITT as to apprehend that HE will not hear us HE who first took HE who still holds the reins of government with the hearty concurrence the generous applause of an admiring nation HE whose nobleness of soul has so remarkably shewn how open he is to conviction I can have no doubt that when he has made himself master of the subject sees that the articles of the Union would be infringed and knows how very unpopular this bill isI can have no doubt that he will send for  the Minister for Scotland  and tell him in a determined tone  Dundas Dundas  for shame Here is a rock upon which we might have split as  Fox  did  upon his  India bill  I'll hear no more of this Court of Session job It is a monstrous measure Let it be quashed  GREAT SIR forgive my thus presumptuously thus rashly attempting for a moment to forge your thunder But I conjure youin the name of GOD and the KING I conjure youto announce in your own lofty language that there shall be a stop put to this conspiracy which I fear might have the effect of springing a mine that would blow up your administration Believe me sincere when I now tell you that although I with all deference cannot join you in one pointa reform in parliament for the reasons I have givensuch  is my confidence in your talents and virtues such my sense of the good you have done and my hope of the good you are yet to do that though not blest with high heroick blood but rather I think troubled with a natural timidity of personal danger which it costs me some philosophy to overcome I ampersuaded I have so much real patriotism in my breast that I should not hesitate to draw my sword in your defence It is the ROYAL CAUSE I tremble at the recollection of that parliamentary anarchy from which your magnanimity delivered us A return of such confusion would be now a more dreadful calamity we should be forced in wild dismay to exclaim  Chaos is come again  My countrymen have I not heartened you somewhat by pointing out to you so many eminent men to whom we may fly for refuge and obtain it  Sir  George Saville  whose name though he be dead is enough to rouse every dormant spark of public spirit had a political maxim which is striking and I beleive will be found true He said that in whatever way any nation was governed for any considerable time it  ought  to be governed in that manner It was proved by experience that that kind of government was adapted to that people If they maintained their freedom they ought to be free if they submitted to slavery they ought to  be slaves  This letter was printed thus far May when I had the honour to dine in company with Mr  Justice Willes  to whom I am indebted for many civilities at the court holden at the Old Bailey London And he told us from his father my Lord  Chief Justice Willes  that when his father was no more than a  King's Counsel  he visited  John Duke of Argyll  at his seat at  Adderbury  He found him sitting in his great chair and a number of the nobility and gentry of  Scotland  standing round him  Vulgi  stante coronathe  great vulgar  are certainly worse than the  small  The Duke said  My dear  Willes  won't you have a chair  And Mr  Willes  was accordingly seated But not one of those nobility and gentry presumed to sit in his GRACE'S presence He was the  Minister for ScotlandO servum pecus  Do not I beseech you my countrymen allow prescription to run against you Do not let your equity of redemption be foreclosed  What says our own  Fletcher of Saltoun  There is not perhaps  in human affairs any thing so unaccountable as the indignity and cruelty with which mankind suffer themselves to be used under  pretence  of  Government  When Peter the Great Czar of  Muscovy  was in England he wished to see the punishment of  keelhailing  He asked the King to shew it him  Sir said he I cannot unless a man be found who deserves it    That shall be no objection said the Czar Take one of my fellows  The King of  England  nobly replied  Know Sir that when a man of any nation whatever has set his foot upon  English  ground he is a freeman he is entitled to the protection of the laws of this country  The application of this illustrious anecdote to the protection which the  People of Scotland  may expect from  English  Members of Parliament is very obvious We are now one people though  a river here there an ideal line  divides what once were only sister kingdoms Are not  we  then on the north of the Tweed to participate of British moderation in government as well as those on the south of the Tweed And are any despots of our own land to be permitted to oppress us I hope not We may then say to the  English  Members in the strong language of Dr  Young  in one of his tragedies "O guard us from ourselves"  It will be in vain to attempt hurry and evasion and cajolingit will  be in vain to employ what powers of lively ridicule our taskmasters possess and to represent this alarm to be similar to the absurd hueandcry against the change of the  style  which  Hogarth  so exquisitely burlesques  Give us our eleven days    Give us our five Lords of Session  Believe me it is no joke and it cannot be made like a joke A  violation of the articles of the Union  and an  extinction of one third of our judicial relief  which is even now inadequate to the wants of our country are serious things or else  there's nothing serious in mortality  Shall  one  of the  troubles of life  which make the pensive  Hamlet  balance whether one ought to throw off the burthen of it be augmented by  another  Shall  "the law's delay" be rendered still more tedious by stretching  the insolence of office  In my zeal to prevent what appears to me a most pernicious innovation I may have been somewhat intemperate in my expression I hope allowance will be made for it For though agitated and indignant I am free from rancour I write for both sides of the Tweed Though my warning letter goes  directly  to  Scotland  I mean that it should  reverberate  on  England  But it would hurt me very much if by any misapprehension it could possibly be thought that  any extensive severity in this pamphlet  for  pauca macula  there will ever be in all human institutions  is pointed  against the honourable judges who at present compose the Court of Session  under the authority of which I have practised the law lo these nineteen years  "Most potent grave and reverend signors  "My very noble and approved good masters"  And therefore though I can scarcely for a moment suppose it necessary  I do now in most explicit terms disavow an intention so injurious  I have argued  hypothetically  and we all know that an  hypothesis  referable to a distant and imagined period which I trust shall never arrive may be formed as strongly and even extravagantly as imagination can figure  But the  permanency  of the  constitution  of the court as fixed by article  of the Treaty of Union is  not imaginary  For in corrobaration of the passage which I have already transcribed I beg leave to add that after specifying the qualifications then requisite for Lords of Session that same article of the Treaty says  yet so as the  qualifications  made or to be made for capacitating persons to be named Ordinary Lords of Session  may be altered by the Parliament of GreatBritain  Does not this make it perfectly clear that the  constitution of  the court may  not  be altered  Exceptio firmat regulam in casibus non exceptis  In a former part of this letter I suggested as a  regulation  of  improvement  upon the administration of  justice in our  unalterable Court of Session  that the  ten  senior judges or only the  five  senior judges should sit in the  inner house  as the Court of Review But it now occurs to me that it is not always certain that the oldest judges will be the wisest and therefore I would rather have them to sit  seven  and  seven  alternately with the President four with him or a presiding judge in his room to make a quorum to review the separate decisions of the Ordinary Lords Let the suitors have time to make their election of either of those Courts of Seven Let the President deliver his opinion but have no vote unless where there happens to be an equality of voices And as at present no decree is final till after two consecutive judgements  of the  inner house  let there for the second judgement be a privilege to obtain a new trial before the whole  fifteen  as at present upon cause shewn and let the whole fifteen sit one week in each month for rejecting or receiving such applications and deciding upon them My suggestions are offered with great diffidence but they are all  legal  they do not infringe the sacred constitution of the College of Justice  I have one other circumstance to communicate but it is of the highest value I communicate it with a mixture of awe and fondnessThat Great Personage who is allowed by all to have the best  memory  of any man  born a Briton  and is known by those  who know him best to have a very sound understanding and a very humane heart may probably  recollect  that in a conversation with  one of the most zealous Royalists of the age  he was graciously pleased to give General  Paoli  the just praise of  putting law into a people who were lawless  What barbarous oppression what political guilt would it be in part to extinguish law amongst a brave people who have long enjoyed it and who agreed to the abolition of their own government upon the faith of unalterable articles of Union in consequence of which they are now at a great distance from the seat of government to which it is not easy for their voice to extend  This letter hastily written upon the spur of the occasion is already too long Yet allow me my friends and countrymen while I with honest zeal maintain  your  causeallow me to indulge a little more my  own egotism  and  vanity  They are the indigenous plants of my mind they distinguish it I may prune their luxuriancy but I must not entirely clear it of them For then I should be no longer "as I am" and perhaps there might be something not so good  Virtus laudata crescitSume superbiam quesitam meritis  I last year claimed the credit of being no  timeserver  I think I am giving pretty good proof that I am not so this year neither Though ambitious I am uncorrupted and I envy not  high situations which are attained by the want of publick virtue in men born without it or by the prostitution of publick virtue in men born with it Though power and wealth and magnificence may at first dazzle and are I think most desireable no wise man will upon sober reflection envy a situation which he feels he could not enjoy My Friend my  Maecenas Atavis edite regibus  Lord  Mountstuart  flattered me once very highly without intending it  I would do any thing for you said he but bring you into parliament for I could not be sure but you might oppose me in something the very next day  His lordship judged well Though I should consider with much attention the opinion of such  a friendbefore taking my resolution most certainly I should oppose him in any measure which I was satisfied ought to be opposed I cannot exist with pleasure if I have not an honest independence of mind and of conduct for though no man loves good eating and drinking simply considered better than I doI prefer the broiled bladebone of mutton and humble port of "downright  Shippen  " to all the luxury of all the statesmen who play the political game all through  It is my system to regard in a publick capacitymeasures and not men in a private capacitymen and not measures I can discuss topicks of literature or any other topicks with mitred  St Asaph  with  Wyndham  of  Norfolk  with  Capel Loft  with Dr  Kippis  with Dr  Price  with the Reverend Mr  John Palmer  yet there are points of government in some of them and points of faith in others as to which had I any thing to do in the administration of this country I should  withstand them to the face  I can drink I can laugh I can converse in perfect good humour with Whigs with Republicans with Dissenters with Independents with Quakers with Moravians with Jews They can do me no harm My mind is made up My principles are fixed But I would vote with Tories and pray with a Dean and Chapter  While I arraign what strikes me as very wrong in Mr Henry Dundas  and the Lord Advocate in their publick conduct I am ready to meet them on friendly but equal terms in private To the Lord Advocate I am most willing to allow all his merit He has risen to the head of our bar No man with us ever pushed the business of a lawyer to that extent that he has done He has made it a Peruvian profession yet he is free from the sordidness which sometimes attends those who get a great deal of money by laborious employment upon every occasion that I have known him tried he was generous And he is a very friendly man I should be exceedingly ungrateful if I did not acknowledge it  That Mr Dundas and he should think of attempting such a bill as this  must make us wonder and for a moment shew us how weak the ablest men are upon some occasions I may without offence account for it by using the very expression of Mr Dundas himself when attacking at the bar of the House of Lords a decree of the Court of Session in the case of a schoolmaster where I was counsel on the other side I can swear to the phrase  They have been seized with some  infatuation  I cannot allow myself to imagine that Mr  Dundas  means to make poor  Scotland  the scapegoat to be sacrificed on the altar of  Reform  and to please the Minister with a  small  one because he has been disappointed of a  great  he shall have a  reform of the Court of  Session  since he cannot have a  Reform of Parliament  to which by the bye I did not know till t'other day that Mr Dundas himself notwithstanding appearances has always been a friend No no This cannot be WILLIAM PITT would despise such pitiful game  Aut Caesar aut nihil  is HIS motto  Poor is the triumph o'er the timorous hare"  We must go to the  Aeneid  for HIS prototype  At puer Ascanius mediis in vallibus acri  Gaudet equo jamque hos cursu jam superat illos  Spumantemque dari pecora inter inertia votis  Optat aprum aut fulvum descendere monte leonem  The suspicion of such a sacrifice could be hatched only in  Scotland  where before the  heretable jurisdictions  were abolished a man was tried  for his life in the court of one of the chieftains The jury were going to bring him in not guilty but somebody whispered them that  the young  Laird  had never seen an execution  upon which their verdict was  Death  and the man was hangedThough our young Minister has not yet seen a reform I hope the Court of Session shall be spared  Then trust me Percy pity it were  And great offence to kill  Any of these our harmless men  For they have done no ill  I exhort you my friends and countrymen in the words of my departed  Goldsmith  who gave me many  nootes atticae  and gave me a jewel of the finest waterthe acquaintance of Sir  Joshua Reynolds  I again exhort  you to  fly from petty tyrants to the Throne  Apply to the KING the fountain of law justice and jurisdiction your application will not be in vainMy ingenious friend Mr  Tyers  in his admirable  Political Conferences  makes Lord  Strafford  defending to  Pym  his attachment to  Charles  I express the very thoughts in my breast  In my highest flights whilst a commoner my heart was never averse to monarchy I was then neither a Puritan nor an Arminian  The more opportunities I possess of knowing the King the more strongly am I attached to his person and authority  A King of England is not to be reduced to the insignificance of a Doge of Venice Since the murder of  Buckingham  who ruled I confess with a very high hand the King has  no favourite  He has taken upon him the task of being  more his own Minister  and therefore you have not so much reason to apprehend any violation of popular rights  My much respected great grandfather that "worthy gentleman"  David Boswell of Auchinleck  Thomas Boswell  was the first  Laird  of  Auchinleck  pronounced  Affleck  Ayrshire after the estate had fallen to the Crown by the forfeiture of the very ancient family of  that ilk i e  of the  same name  there being no record nor tradition of any other family having it I am told the  Afflecks  of  England  are the heirs of the forfeited family I am proud of the  connection  but should be unwilling to resign to them the  estate  of which they have now no need  Thomas Boswell  was a descendant of the family of  Balmuto  in  Fife  whose estate was purchased in this century by a younger son of my family The wife of  Thomas Boswell  was a daughter of  Campbell  of  Londoun  and a granddaughter of the forfeited  Affleck  He was honoured in with a charter from James IV of Scotland  Dilecto familiari nostropro bono et fideli servitio nobis prestito  He was killed with his King at the  fatal field  of  Flodden  in fighting against the  English  though he was himself of old Yorkshire extraction being descended of the respectable family of  Bosville  or  Boswell  for both they and we have spelt it both ways at different times of  Gunthwait  in the West Riding After a separation for ages I united our  branch  in cordial friendship with the  Stock  our  Chief  the late  Godfrey Bosville  Esq as honest a man as perfect an example of  the noblest work of God  as ever breathed That friendship is continued with his son  William Bosville  Esq who with his father's honest heart has the curiosity of  Ulysses  which he has gratified very extensively He is to let me have a freehold in Yorkshire a small bit of the old manour which will connect us from generation to generationIf it should be asked What has this note to do here I answerto illustrate the authour of the text And to "pour out all myself as old  Montaigne  " I wish all this to be known and you who censure it have read it and  must  therefore know it I am at home in Yorkshire and I last year assisted at that glorious meeting where loyalty and liberty united in addressing his Majesty  a true heart  of oak with a vigorous mind and a robust body secured our male succession  His uncle though he had four daughters the eldest of whom was married to Lord  Cathcart  who would have been glad to have had our  old rock  was feudal enough to give him the estate That  Laird  used to say  He never saw a man in his life that he did not think himself his master  I  pejor  avis  cannot say so much But this I will say that  I call no man master  without reserve When I have fixed my opinion upon an important question I maintain it as a point of conscience as a point of honour and the SOVEREIGN himself would find me  tenacem propositi  as I humbly but firmly was upon the subject of the American war I am a  Tory  but not a  Slave  I am possessed of an essay dictated to me by Dr  Johnson  on the distinction between a  Whig  and a  Tory  in which it is shewn by the wonderous powers of that illustrious mind that there is but a shade of difference between a moderate Whig and a spirited Tory between reasonable men of each party Much would I yield rather  than shake the reverence due to Majesty by opposition But there may come an enterprise of great moment as to which it would be deeply culpable to conceal my sentimentsas to which I may think myself obliged to be a faithful an intrepid an

faithful humble servant JAMES BOSWELL  London  May  POSTSCRIPT  SINCE this Letter was finished I have read "  The Rights of Juries vindicated  in the case of the  Dean of St Asaph  in the  King's Bench  " where Mr  Erskine  added so much to the lustre of his professional character and inconsiderable as my approbation may be I cannot refrain from saying that Mr  Welch's  speech upon that occasion appears to me for legal knowledge acute reasoning and true constitutional spirit to be a masterly performance and to establish beyond question that the Juries of  England  are judges of law as well as of fact in  many civil  and in  all criminal  trials Let me be also permitted to add one to the number of his Majesty's subjects who heartily honour Mr  Justice Willes  for his clear free yet temperate doctrine delivered as a judge not unworthy to have been one at the trial of the Seven BishopsThat my principles of  resistance  may not be misapprehended any more than my principles of  submission  I protest that I should be the last man in the world to encourage juries to contradict rashly wantonly or perversely the opinion of the judges On the contrary I would have them listen respectfully to the advice they receive from the Bench by  which they may often be well directed in forming their own opinion which "and not another's" is the opinion they are to return upon their oaths But where after due attention to all that the judge has said they are decidedly of a different opinion from him they have not only a  power  and a  right  but they are  bound in conscience  to bring in a verdict accordingly Thus it was in the late case of  Spence  at Edinburgh which I have mentioned The jury with every bias for the security of their own property and peace with every disposition as good citizens to check a desperate rage of mobbing were nevertheless satisfied that that young soldier my client then the prisoner at the bar upon the  general issue  compounded of law and of fact  to use the evermemorable words of Baron  Eyre  in Colonel  Gordon's  trial was not guilty of the felonious  fireraising  or  arson  with which he was charged and therefore they acquitted him at which my heart rebounded It is but justice to add that we have at Edinburgh a most respectable gentleman Sir  William Forbes  of  Pitsligo  who when sitting as a juryman and hearing one of the judges mutter audibly that  the law must be left to the court  rose in his place and with a proper courage asserted the  full right  of himself and his bretheren which had a very good effect  In the

it will convey a specimen of that conversation in which Wisdom and Wit were equally conspicuous
