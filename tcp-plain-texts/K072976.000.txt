 DON QUIXOTE IN  ENGLAND  A COMEDY As it is Acted at the NEW THEATRE in the  HayMarket  By  HENRY FIELDING    Esq  facilè quis  Speret idem sudet multúm frustráque laboret  Ausus idem  Hor  LONDON  Printed for J WATTS at the PrintingOffice in  WildCourt  near  Lincoln'sInn Fields  MDCCXXXIV  Price One Shilling and Six Pence  To the RIGHT HONOURABLE PHILIP  EARL  of CHESTERFIELD Knight of the most Noble Order of the GARTER  MY LORD  _HOWEVER unworthy these Scenes may be of Your LORDSHIP'S Protection the Design with which some of them  were written cannot fail of recommending them to ONE who hath so gloriously distinguished Himself in the Cause of Liberty to which the Corruption I have here endeavoured to expose may one Day be a very fatal Enemy  The Freedom of the Stage is perhaps as well worth contending for as that of the Press It is the Opinion of an Author well known to Your LORDSHIP that Examples work quicker and stronger on the Minds of Men than Precepts  This will I believe my LORD be found truer with  regard to Politicks than to Ethicks The most ridiculous Exhibitions of Luxury or Avarice may likely have little Effect on the Sensualist or the Miser but I fansy a lively Representation of the Calamities brought on a Country by general Corruption might have a very sensible and useful Effect on the Spectators  Socrates  who owed his Destruction greatly to the Contempt brought on him by the Comedies of  Aristophanes  is a lasting Instance of the Force of Theatrical Ridicule Here indeed this Weapon was used to an ill Purpose  but surely what is able to bring Wisdom and Virtue into Disrepute will with great Facility lay their Opposites under a general Contempt There are among us who seem so sensible of the Danger of Wit and Humour that they are resolved to have nothing to do with them And indeed they are in the right on't for Wit like Hunger will be with great Difficulty restrained from falling on where there is great Plenty and Variety of Food  But while the powerful Sons of Dulness shed all their Influence on their inferior Brethren  be You My LORD who are the most favourite Offspring of the  British  Muses the Patron of their younger Children whom Your LORDSHIP has as much Reason to love as others to fear for you must have seen that to be celebrated by them and applauded by the more discerning and worthy are the only Rewards which true Patriotism a Word scandalously ridicul'd by some can securely expect And here I am pleading the Cause of others for the only Title I have to enrol my self in the Number of those I have recommended to Your Favour  is by being with the most perfect Admiration and Respect  My LORD  Your  LORDSHIP  'S most obedient and most humble Servant  HENRY FIELDING  PREFACE  THIS Comedy was begun at  Leyden  in the Year and after it had been sketched out into a few loose Scenes was thrown by and for a long while no more thought of It was originally writ for my private Amusement as it would indeed have been little less than Quixotism itself to hope any other Fruits from attempting Characters wherein the inimitable  Cervantes  so far excelled The Impossibility of going beyond and the extreme Difficulty of keeping pace with him were sufficient to infuse Despair into a very adventurous Author  I soon discovered too that my too small Experience in and little Knowledge of the World had led me into an Error I soon found it infinitely more difficult than I imagined to vary the Scene and give my  Knight an Opportunity of displaying himself in a different manner from that wherein he appears in the Romance Human Nature is every where the same And the Modes and Habits of particular Nations do not change it enough sufficiently to distinguish a  Quixore  in  England  from a  Quixote  in  Spain  In these Sentiments Mr  Booth  and Mr  Cibber  concurred with me who upon seeing the aforesaid Sketch both dissuaded me from suffering it to be represented on the Stage and accordingly it was remanded back to my Shelf where probably it would have perished in Oblivion had not the Solicitations of the distrest Actors in  DruryLane  prevail'd on me to revise it at the same time that it came into my Head to add those Scenes concerning our Elections  Being thus altered it was often rehearsed on that Theatre and a particular Day appointed for its Action but the Giant  Cajanus  of a Race who were always  Enemies to our poor  Don  deferred his Appearance so long that the Intervention of the Actor's Benefits would have put it off till the next Season had I not brought it on where now it appears  I have troubled the Reader thus long to account for this Comedy's appearing as it now does and that he might distinguish those Parts of it which were the Production of this Season from those which were written in my more juvenile Years and before most of the Pieces with which I have endeavoured to entertain the Publick  A TABLE of the SONGS  AIR Rogues there are of each Nation  Page    AIR Oh think

MANAGER  NO Prologue Sir The Audience will never bear it They will not bate you any thing of their due  Auth  I am the Audience's very humble Servant but they cannot make a Man write a Prologue whether he can or no  Man  Why Sir there is nothing easier I have known an Author bring three or four to the House with one Play and give us our Choice which we would speak  Auth  Yes Sir and I have now three in my Pocket written by Friends of which I choose none should be spoke  Man  How so  Auth  Because they have been all spoke already twenty times over  Man  Let me see them pray  Auth  They are written in such damn'd cramp Hands you will never be able to read them but I will tell you the Substance of them One of them begins with abusing the Writings of all my Cotemporaries lamenting the fallen State of the Stage and lastly assuring the Audience that this Play was written with a Design to restore true Taste and their approving it is the best Symptom they can give of their having any  Man  Well and a very good Scheme  Auth  May be so but it hath been the Subject of almost every Prologue for these ten Years last past The Second is in a different Cast The first twelve Lines inveigh against all Indecency on the Stage and the last twenty Lines shew you what it is  Man  That would do better for an Epilogue But what is the Third  Auth  Why the Third has some Wit in it and would have done very well but for a Mistake  Man  Ay What Mistake  Auth  Why the Author never read my Play and taking it for a regular Comedy of Five Acts hath fallen very severely on Farce However it is a pretty good one and will do very well for the first genteel Comedy you bring on the Stage  Man  But don't you think a Play with so odd a Title as yours requires to be a little explain'd May they not be too much surpris'd at some things  Auth  Not at all The Audience I believe are all acquainted with the Character of  Don Quixote  and  Sancho  I have brought them over into  England  and introduced them at an Inn in the Country where I believe no one will be surpris'd that the Knight finds several People as mad as himself This I could have told them in forty dull Lines if I would but I rather chose to let it alone for to tell you the Truth I can draw but one Conclusion from the Prologues I have ever seen that the Authors are so sensible of the Demerits of their Plays that they desire to set the Audience asleep before they begin But of what real Use is a Bill of Fare to any Entertainment where the Guests are not left to their Choice what Part they will pick at but are oblig'd to swallow the Whole indifferently  Enter a Player  Play  Sir the Audience make such a Noise with their Canes that if we don't begin immediately they will beat the House down before the Play begins and it is not advisable to put them out of Humour for there are two or three of the loudest Catcalls in the Gallery that ever were heard  Auth  Be not frightned at that Those are only some particular Friends of mine who are to put on the Face of Enemies at first and be converted at the End of the First Act  Man  Order then to play away the Overture immediately Come Sir what do you do with yourself  Auth  I shall dispose my self in some Part of the House where I shall see and not be seen And I can assure you Sir if the Audience are but half as well entertain'd with this Play as I shall be my self it will go off with universal Applause  DON QUIXOTE IN ENGLAND  ACT I SCENE I  SCENE  An Inn    GUZZLE SANCHO  GUZZLE  _NEVER tell me Sir of Don  Quixote  or Don  Beelzebub  here's a Man comes into my House and eats me out on't and then tells me he's a KnightErrant he is an arrant Rogue and if he does not pay me my Bill I'll have a Warrant for him  San  My Master fears no Warrant Friend had you ever been in  Spain  you would have known that Men of his Order are above the Law  Guz  Tell not me of  Spain  Sir I am an  Englishman  where no one is above the Law and if your Master does not pay me I shall lay his  Spaniardship  fast in a Place which he shall find it as difficult to get out of as your Countrymen have found it to get into  Gibraltar  San  That's neither here nor there as the old Saying is many are shut into one Place and out of another Men bar Houses to keep Rogues out and Jails to keep them in He that's hang'd for stealing a Horse today has no reason to buy Oats for him tomorrow  Guz  Sirrah your Horse nor your Ass neither shall have any more Oats at my Expence never were Masters and their Beasts so like one another The  Don  is just such another lean Ramscallion as hiswhat d'ye call himhis  Rozinante  and thou art just such another squat Bag of Guts as thy  Dapple  Send my House and my Stable once well emptied of you and if ever I suffer a  Spaniard  to enter my Doors again may I have a whole Company of Soldiers quartered on me for if I must be eaten up I had rather suffer by my own Country Rogues than foreign ones  AIR I  San  Rogues there are of each Nation  Except among the Divines  And Vinegar since the Creation  Hath still been made of all Wines  Against one Lawyer  Lurch  A County scarce can guard  One Parson does for a Church  One Doctor for a Churchyard  SCENE II  Don Quixote Sancho  Quix  Sancho  San  An't please your Honour  Quix  Come hither  Sancho  I smell an Adventure  San  And so do I an't please your Worship the Landlord of the House swears bitterly that he will have a Warrant against us  Quix  What Landlord What House Wilt thou never be in thy Senses Are we not in a Castle  San  No marry are we not but we are in a fair way to be in one  Quix  What dost thou mean Oaf  San  I mean that I shall see your Honour in a Goal within these two Days  Quix  Me in a Goal Ha Caitif  San  Ay Sir we are got into a terrible Country A Man's Quality here can't defend him if he breaks the Laws  Quix  Then indeed KnightErrantry were of no Use But I tell thee Caitif Goals in all Countries are only Habitations for the Poor not for Men of Quality If a poor Fellow robs a Man of Fashion of Five Shillings to Goal with him But the Man of Fashion may plunder a thousand Poor and stay in his own House But know thou base Squire of the great Don  Quixote de la Mancha  that an Adventure now presents it self not only worthy me but the united Force of all the Knights upon Earth  San  Ah poor  Sancho  there's an end of thee a Leg or an Arm will not suffice this Bout  Quix  There is now arrived in this Castle one of the most accursed Giants that ever infested the Earth He marches at the Head of his Army that howl like  Turks  in an Engagement  San  Oh Lud Oh Lud this is the Country Squire at the Head of his Pack of Dogs  Quix  What dost thou mutter Varlet  San  Why Sir this Giant that your Worship talks of is a Country Gentleman who is going a courting and his Army is neither more nor less than his Kennel of FoxHounds  Quix  Oh the prodigious Force of Inchantment Sirrah I tell thee this is the Giant  Toglogmoglogog  Lord of the Island of  Gogmogog  whose Belly hath been the Tomb of above a thousand strong Men  San  Of above a thousand Hogsheads of strong Beer I believe  Quix  This must be the Inchanter  Merlin  I know him by his Dogs but thou Idiot dost thou imagine that Women are to be hunted like Hares that a Man would carry his Hounds with him to visit his Mistress  San  Sir your true  English  Squire and his Hounds are as inseparable as your  Spanish  and his  Toledo  He eats with his Hounds drinks with his Hounds and lies with his Hounds your true Errant  English  Squire is but the first DogBoy in his House  Quix  'Tis pity then that Fortune should contradict the Order of Nature It was a wise Institution of  Plato  to educate Children according to their Minds not to their Births these Squires should sow that Corn which they ride over  Sancho  when I see a Gentleman in his own Coachbox I regret the Loss which some one has had of a Coachman the Man who toils all Day after a Partridge or a Pheasant might serve his Country by toiling after a Plough and when I see a low mean tricking Lord I lament the Loss of an excellent Attorney    Singing within    But hark some courteous Lady in the Castle prepares an Entertainment for my Ears  AIR II  Tweed  Side  Oh think not the Maid whom you scorn  With Riches delighted can be  Had I a great Princess been born  My  Billy  had dear been to me  In Grandeur and Wealth we find Woe  In Love there is nothing but Charms  On others your Treasures bestow  Give  Billy  alone to these Arms  In Title and Wealth what is lost  In Tenderness oft' is repaid  Too much a great Fortune may cost  Well purchas'd may be the poor Maid  Let Gold's empty Show cheat the Great  We more real Pleasures will prove  While they in their Palaces hate  We in our poor Cottage will love  SCENE III  Don Quixote Guzzle Sancho  Quix  Most illustrious and most mighty Lord how shall I sufficiently pay you for those Sounds with which I have been ravish'd  Guz  Sir I desire no other Payment but of this small Bill your Worship's Cattle are saddled and it is a charming Day for travelling  Quix  Nothing my Lord shall ever tempt me to leave you till what I have this Day seen within the CastleWalls be utterly demolished  Guz  So he has seen the Sirloin of Beef at the Fire I find    Aside    But if your Worship intends to stay any longer I hope you design to satisfy this small Matter here I am in great Necessity I assure you  Quix  To what mean Actions does Necessity force Men That ever a mighty Lord should be obliged to borrow Money  Guz  I am asham'd to ask your Worship so often for this Trifle but  Quix  My Lord I see you are I see the generous Confusion which spreads your Face  Guz  I am so poor an't please your Honour that it will be quite Charity in you It is the same as if you gave it me  Quix  My Lord I am more confus'd than you but do not think it a Gift since I see you so backward to receive it in that Light And since my Lord every thing I have saving to the charming  Dulcinea del Toboso  her fixt and unalterable Right be justly yours Give me leave to call it a Debt my Lord  Sancho  pay his Lordship a thousand  English  Guineas  San  If your Worship will please to tell me where I shall get them but there's no paying with an empty Hand where nothing is nothing can come on't Twelve Lawyers make not one honest Man  Quix  Cease thy Impertinence and pay the Money immediately  San  If I have seen the Colour of Gold this Fortnight may I never see  Teresa Pancha  again  Quix  I am confounded my Lord at the Extravagance of my Squire who out of the Spoils of so many Giants he hath plunder'd should not have reserv'd enough to oblige your Lordship with such a Trifle but if you know any one who will disemburse that Sum or any other I will sell him the Reversion of the next Island I conquer  Guz  Do you make a Jest of me Sir  Quix  Be not incens'd I am sorry I am not able to give it you  Guz  Sorry forsooth a pretty way of paying Debts truly I fansy if I was to tell the Exciseman and my Brewer I was sorry I could not pay 'em they would send me and my Sorrow to Goal together In short Sir I must and I will have my Money  San  You must get the  Philosophers Stone  before you can make any Money of us  Guz  You shall neither eat nor drink any more in my House 'till I am paid that I'm resolv'd  San  I wish your Worship would think of changing your Quarters if it must be a Balnketing why let it be a Blanketing I have not eat any thing these twelve Hours and I don't find I am like to fare much better for the next twelve and by that time I shall be so light you may as well toss a Feather in a Blanket  Quix  Sancho  come hither I intend to make thee my Ambassador  San  Why truly Sir that's a Post I should like hugeously well your Bassadours lead rare fat Lives they say and I should make a very good Bassadour I can assure your Worship  Quix  Thou shalt go my Ambassador to the Court of  Dulcinea del Toboso  San  I suppose it is equal to your Worship what Court you send me to and to say the Truth I had rather go to some other for tho' my Lady  Dulcinea  be a very good Woman yet she has got such a waundy Trick of being chanted and I fansy your Bassadours fare but ill at your chanted Courts  Quix  Reptile reply not on thy Life but go and prepare thy self for thy Journey then come to me and receive farther Instructions for thou shalt set out this very EveningBut Ha the charming Voice begins again  AIR III Why will  Florella  c  Dorothea  sings within    The Pain which tears my throbbing Breast  What Language can deplore  For how should Language have exprest  A Pain ne'er felt before  In other Virgin wounded Hearts  Love's cruel Sport we see  But the most cruel of his Darts  He has reserv'd for me  Quix  Unhappy Princess  Dor  Thy Curse O  Tantalus  I'd prize  Thy Curse a Bliss would prove  Ah Heaven were kind if with my Eyes  I could enjoy my Love  Inchanted thus Romances tell  Their Moans poor Virgins make  But where is found the powerful Spell  Can this Inchantment break  Quix  In this Arm 'tis found Look forth most adorable tho' most unhappy Princess look forth and behold whom Fate hath sent to your Relief the most renowned Knight of the woful Figure the invincible  Don Quixote de la Mancha  for whose victorious Arm alone this Adventure is reserv'd Oh cursed Inchanter dost thou keep this charming Princess invisible to my Eyes Open the CastleGates open them this Instant whoever is on the Guard or you shall feel the Force of my Attack You shall find Caitifs that one single Knight is too many for you all    He attacks the Walls and breaks the Windows  SCENE IV  Don Quixote Guzzle and Mob  Guz  Heyday What in the Devil's Name are you doing What do you intend to beat down my House  Quix  Thou most uncourteous Lord deliver the Princess whom thou so unjustly dost detain or think not that all the Inchanters on Earth shall preserve thee from my Vengeance  Guz  Don't tell me of Princesses and Lords I'm no Lord I am an honest Man and I can tell you you may be a Gentleman but you don't act like one to break a poor Man's Windows in this manner  Quix  Deliver the Princess Caitif  Guz  Pay me my Bill Sir and go out of my House or I'll fetch a Warrant for you I'll see whether a Man is to have his Victuals eat up and Drink drank out and Windows broke and his Walls shatter'd and his Guest disturb'd for nothing  Quix  Ungracious Knight who so often throwest in my Teeth that small Entertainment which thou art oblig'd to give Men of my heroick Profession  Guz  I believe indeed your Profession does oblige People sometimes to give whether they will or no  Quix  It is too plain thou Wretch why thou wouldest have me gone thou knowest the Delivering of this high Lady thou dost detain is reserved for me alone but deliver her this Moment with all her Attendants all her Plate and Jewels which thou hast robb'd her of  Guz  Hear this Neighbours I am accus'd of stealing Plates and Jewels when every Body knows I have but five Dozen of Plates and those I bought and paid for honestly and as for Jewels the Devil of any Jewels are there in this House but two Bobs that my Wife wears in her Ears which were given her by Sir  Thomas Loveland  at his last Election  Quix  Cease thy Equivocations and deliver them this Instant or thou shalt find how vainly thou dost trust to all those Giants at thy Heels    The Mob laugh    Do you mock me Caitifs Now thou most incomparable  Dulcinea del Toboso  assist thy valiant Knight    He drives them off and Exit  SCENE V  A Chamber  Dorothea Jezebel  Dor  Ha ha ha in spite of all my Misfortunes I cannot help laughing at the pleasant Adventure of the Knight of the woful Figure  Jez  Do you think Madam this is the very same  Don  what d'ye call him whom your Father saw in  Spain  and of whom he has told us such pure pleasant Stories  Dor  The same it can be no other Oh  Jezebel  I wish my Adventure may end as happily as those of my Namesake  Dorothea  's did I am sure they are very near as romantick But have not I reason to blame  Fairlove  for suffering me to be here before him The Lover that does not outfly his Mistress's Desires is slow indeed  Jez  And let me tell you Madam he must be very swift who does  AIR IV  Dor  Oh hasten my Lover dear  Cupid    Wing hither the Youth I admire  The Wretch is too lazy and stupid  Who leaves me but Time to desire  Let Prudes who leave Lovers in Anguish  Themselves in their fonder Fits stay  But leave not the Virgin to languish  Who meets her true Lover half way  Well I'm a mad Girl Don't you think this Husband of mine that is to be will have a delightful Task to tame me  Jez  By what I can see he's in a pretty fair way to be tamed himself  SCENE VI  Sancho Dorothea Jezebel  San  Pray Ladies which of you is the chanted Princess or are you both chanted Princesses  Jez  What is it to you what we are Saucebox  Dor  Peace dear  Jezebel  This must be the illustrious  Sancho  himselfI am the Princess  Indoccalambria  San  My Master the Knight of the Woful Figure and a woful Figure he makes sure enough sends your Ladyship his humble Service and hopes you will not take it amiss that he has not been able to knock all the People in the House on the Head however he has made it pretty well up in breaking the Windows your Ladyship will lie pure and cool for the Devil a whole Pane is there in all your Apartment if the Glazier had hir'd him he cou'd not have done better  Dor  Thou mighty Squire of the most mighty Knight upon Earth give my grateful Thanks to your Master for what he has undertaken upon my Account but tell him not to get his precious Bones bruis'd any more for I am sufficiently assur'd this Adventure is reserv'd for some other Knight  San  Nay nay like enough all Men cannot do all things one Man gets an Estate by what another gets a Halter All is not Fish that swims Many a Man wants a Wife but more want to get rid of one Two Cuckolds see each other's Horns when neither of them can see his own Money is the Fruit of Evil as often as the Root of it Charity seldom goes out of her own House and Illnature is always a rambling abroad Every Woman is a Beauty if you will believe her own Glass and few if you will believe her Neighbours  Dor  Ha ha ha Pray Mr  Sancho  might not one hope to see your illustrious Master  San  Nothing would rejoice his Heart so much Madam unless it were to see my Lady  Dulcinea  herself Ah Madam might I hope your Ladyship would speak a good Word for me  Dor  Name it and be assur'd of any thing in my Power honest  Sancho  San  If your Princessship could but prevail on my Master that I might not be sent home after my Lady  Dulcinea  for to tell you the Truth Madam I am so fond of the  English  rost Beef and strong Beer that I don't intend ever to set my Foot in  Spain  again if I can help it Give me a Slice of rost Beef before all the Rarities of  Camacho  's Wedding  Dor  Bravely said noble Squire  AIR V The King's Old Courtier  When mighty rost Beef was the  Englishman  's Food  It enobled our Hearts and enriched our Blood  Our Soldiers were brave and our Courtiers were good  Oh the Rost Beef of Old  England    And Old  England  's Rost Beef  Then  Britons  from all nice Dainties refrain  Which effeminate  Italy    France  and  Spain    And mighty Rost Beef shall command on the Main  Oh the Rost Beef  c  San  Oh the Rost Beef  c  Dor  I have been told noble Squire that you once impos'd a certain Lady for  Dulcinea  on your Master now what think  you if this young Lady here should personate that incomparable Princess  Jez  Who I  San  Adod your Princessship has hit it for he has never seen this  Dulcinea  nor has any body else that I can hear of and who my Lady  Dulcinea  should be I don't know unless she be one of your chanted Ladies The Curate of our Parish and Mr  Nicholas  the Barber have often told me there was no such Woman and that my Master was a Madman and sometimes I am half at a loss to guess whether he be mad or no I'm sure if it was not for the sake of a little Island that I am to govern I should not have follow'd his Errantries so long  Dor  Fy do not entertain such unworthy Thoughts of that most glorious Knight  San  Nay Madam I can't find in my Heart to think him mad neither for he will talk sometimes 'twould do one good to hear him talk he will talk ye three Hours and I shan't understand one Word he says Our Curate was a Fool to e'en and yet he has talk'd what I could not understand neither but that's neither here nor there an empty Purse causes a full Heart an old Woman's a very bad Bribe but a very good Wife Conscience often stops at a Molehill and leaps over a Mountain the Law guards us from all Evil but itself what's Vice today is Virtue tomorrow 'tis not only Plumbs that make a Pudding Physick makes you first sick and then well Wine first makes you well and then sick  Jez  And your Proverbs would make the Devil sick  Dor  Lose no time good  Sancho  but acquaint the most invincible Knight that the Lady  Dulcinea  is in the Castle we'll manage the matter so dexterously you shall be in no danger of a Discovery  San  Since my bringing the last  Dulcinea  to him I do not fear that he that can swallow a Goose will hardly keck at a Gander the Bear may well dance when the Ass plays on the Fiddle    Exit  Sancho  SCENE VII  Dorothea Jezebel  Dor  Ha ha ha Well for the future I will never disbelieve a Traveller the Knight and his Squire are full as ridiculous as they were describ'd We shall have rare Diversion  Jez  Poor  Fairlove  thou art quite forgotten  Dor  I've rather reason to think  Dorothea  so I am sure when a Lover suffers his Mistress to come first to the Place of Appointment he cannot blame any innocent Amusement with which she would shorten his Absence and to confess a Truth to you while I am still under Apprehensions of the Match my Father intends for me I have too great Cause to try to divert my Grief  AIR VI From  Aberdeen  to  Edinburgh    Happy the Animals who stray  In Freedom thro' the Grove  No Laws in Love they e'er obey  But those prescrib'd by Love  While We confin'd to Parents Rules  Unfortunate are told  None follow Love's sweet Laws but Fools  The Wise are Slaves to Gold    Exeunt  SCENE VIII  The Street  Mr  Mayor  and a Voter    May  Well Neighbour what's your Opinion of this strange Man that is come to Town  Don Quixote  as he calls himself  Vot  Think why that he's a Madman What shou'd I think  May  'Ecod it runs in my Head that he is come to stand for Parliamentman  Vot  How can that be Neighbour they tell me he's a  Spaniard    May  What's that to us Let him look to his Qualifications when we have chose him If he can't sit in the House that's his Fault  Vot  Nay nay he can't be chose if he should stand for to my certain Knowledge the Corporation have promis'd Sir  Thomas Loveland  and Mr  Bouncer  May  Pugh all Promises are conditional and let me tell you Mr  Retail  I begin to smoke a Plot I begin to apprehend no Opposition and then we're sold Neighbour  Vot  No no Neighbour then we shall not be sold and that's worse But rather than it should come to that I would ride all over the Kingdom for a Candidate and if I thought Sir  Thomas  intended to steal us in this manner he should have no Vote of mine I assure you I shall vote for no Man who holds the Corporation cheap  May  Then suppose we were to go in a Body and solicit Sir  Don Quixote  to stand As for his being mad while he's out of  Bedlam  it does not signify  Vot  But there is another Objection Neighbour which I am afraid the Corporation will never get over  May  What's that pr'ythee  Vot  They say he has brought no Money with him  May  Ay that indeed But tho' he hath no Money with him here I am assur'd by his Servant that he hath a very large  Estate And so if the other Party come down handsomly with the Ready we may trust him for you know at last we have nothing to do but not to choose him and then we may recover all he owes us  Vot  I do not care to be sold Neighbour  May  Nor I neither Neighbour by any but myself I think that is the Privilege of a free  Briton  SCENE X  Guzzle Mayor Retail  Guz  Mr Mayor a good Morrow to you Sir are you for a Whet this Morning  May  With all my Heart but what's become of the Gentleman the Traveller  Guz  He's laid down to sleep I believe pretty well tired with Work What the Devil to do with him I can't tell  May  My Neighbour and I have a strange Thought come into our Heads you know Mr  Guzzle  we are like to have no Opposition and that I believe you will feel the want of as much as any Man Now d'ye see we have taken it into Consideration whether we should not ask this Sir  Don  to represent us  Guz  With all my Heart if either of you will hang out a Sign and entertain him but he is far enough in my Books already  May  You are too cautious Master  Guzzle  I make no doubt but he is some very rich Man who pretends to be poor in order to get his Election the cheaper he can have no other Design in staying among us For my part I make no doubt but that he is come to stand on the Court Interest  Guz  Nay nay if he stands at all it is on the Court Side no doubt for he talks of nothing but Kings and Princes and Princesses and Emperors and Empresses  May  Ay ay an Officer in the Army too I warrant him if we knew but the bottom  Guz  He seems indeed to be damnably sond of FreeQuarter  Ret  But if you think he intends to offer himself would it not be wiser to let him for then you know if he spends never so much we shall not be oblig'd to choose him  May  Brother Alderman I have reproved you already for that way of Reasoning it savours too much of Bribery I like an Opposition because otherwise a Man may be oblig'd to vote against his Party therefore when we invite a Gentleman to stand we invite him to spend his Money for the Honour of his Party and when both Parties have spent as much as they are able every honest Man will vote according to his Conscience  Guz  Mr Mayor talks like a Man of Sense and Honour and it does me good to hear him  May  Ay ay Mr  Guzzle  I never gave a Vote contrary to my Conscience I have very earnestly recommended the CountryInterest to all my Brethren But before that I recommended the TownInterest that is the Interest of this Corporation and first of all I recommended to every particular Man to take a particular Care of himself And it is with a certain way of Reasoning That he that serves me best will serve the Town best and he that serves the Town best will serve the Country best  Guz  See what it is to have been at  Oxford  the Parson in the Parish himself can't outtalk him  May  Come Landlord we'll have one Bottle and drink Success to the Corporation These Times come but seldom therefore we ought to make the best of them Come along    Exeunt  The End of the First Act  ACT II SCENE I  SCENE  A Chamber in the Inn  Don Quixote Sancho  Quix  THOU hast by this time fully perceiv'd  Sancho  the extreme Difficulties and Dangers of KnightErrantry  San  Ay and of 'SquireErrantry too an't please your Worship  Quix  But Virtue is its own Reward  San  Your Worship may have a Relish for these Rewards perhaps but to speak truly I am a poor plain Man and know nothing of these fine things and for any Reward I have hitherto got I had much rather have gone without it As for an Island I believe I could relish it as well as another but a Man may catch cold while his Coat is making And since you may provide for me in a much easier way if I might be so bold as to speak  Quix  Thou knowest I will deny thee nothing which is fit for me to give or thee to take  San  Then if your Worship wou'd be so good as to set me up in an Inn I should make a rare Landlord and it is a very thriving Trade among the  English  Quix  And couldst thou descend so low ignoble Wretch  San  Any thing to get an honest Livelihood which is more than I find we are like to do in the way we are going on For if I durst speak it  Quix  Speak fearleslyI will only impute it to thy Ignorance  San  Why then I find Sir that we are look'd on here to be neither more nor less better or worse than a couple of Madmen  Quix  Sancho  I am not concern'd at the evil Opinion of Men Indeed if we consider who are their Favourites we shall have no reason to be so fond of their Applause Virtue  Sancho  is too bright for their Eyes and they dare not behold her Hypocrisy is the Deity they worship Is not the Lawyer often call'd an honest Man when for a sneaking Fee he pleads the Villain's Cause or attempts to extort Evidence to the Conviction of the Innocent Does not the Physician live well in his Neighbourhood while he suffers them to bribe his Ignorance to their Destruction But why should I mention those whose Profession 'tis to prey on others Look thro' the World What is it recommends Men but the Poverty the Vice and the Misery of others This  Sancho  they are sensible of and therefore instead of endeavouring to make himself better each Man endeavours to make his Neighbour worse Each Man rises to Admiration by treading on Mankind Riches and Power accrue to the One by the Destruction of Thousands These are the general Objects of the good Opinion of Men Nay and that which is profess'd to be paid to Virtue is seldom more to any thing than a supercilious Contempt of our Neighbour What is a goodnatur'd Man Why one who seeing the Want of his Friend cries he pities him Is this real No If it was he would relieve him His Pity is triumphant Arrogance and Insult It arises from his Pride not from his Compassion  Sancho  let them call me mad I'm not mad enough to court their Approbation  San  Oh good your Worship proceed I could fast an Hour longer to hear your Discourse  SCENE II  Guzzle Don Quixote Sancho  Guz  An't please your Honour the Mayor of the Town is come to wait on you  Quix  Give him Admittance This is the chief Magistrate of the Place who comes I suppose to congratulate me on my Arrival he might have come sooner but the Neglect of his Duty is better than the total Omission In the mean while  Sancho  post thou away this Instant to  Toboso  and Heaven prosper thy Embassy  San  Prosperity may travel with me without tiring itself    Aside  SCENE III  Mayor Don Quixote  May  I am your Honour's most humble Servant  Quix  Sir I am glad to see you I think you are the chief Officer of the Town  May  Yes an't please your Honour I am Mr Mayor of this Town I should have done myself the Pleasure to have waited on you sooner but I was quite ignorant of the Design with which you came hither  Quix  Be seated Sir you are a worthy Man and to your Praise be it spoken the first that has done his Duty since my Arrival  May  I can't answer for the whole Town but the Corporation is as well affected a Corporation as any in all  England  and I believe highly sensible of the Honour you intend them No Man knows his Strength till he tries it and notwithstanding what you may have heard of the Knight of the  LongPurse  if you oppose him briskly I dare answer for your Success  Quix  Is there a Knight on Earth I dare not oppose Tho' he had as many Hands as  Briareus  as many Eyes as  Argus  I should not fear him  May  This is a special Stick of Wood I findA BenefitTicket adod    Aside  Quix  I see the Reason of your Apprehension you have heard of my ill Success in my last Adventurethat was not my Fault    Sighing  May  I see he has been thrown out at some other Place alreadyI don't in the least Sir apprehend it was your Fault but there is nothing to be done without bleeding freely on these Occasions  Quix  Ha do you think I fear to bleed  May  Be not so passionate Sir this I assure you you will do your Business with less than any other I suppose Sir it may lay in your Power to do some Services to this Town  Quix  Be assur'd it does I will for your sake preserve it for ever from any Insults No Armies shall ever do you any Harm  May  I assure you Sir that will recommend you very much If you can keep Soldiers from quartering upon us we shall make very little Difficulty in the Affair But Ihope your Honour will consider that the Town is very poor Sir a little Circulation of Money among us would  Quix  Sir you make me concern'd that it is not now in my Power to give whatever you desire but rest secure of this there is not one whom you shall recommend that shall not within this Twelvemonth be Governor of an Island  May  This is a Courtier I find by his Promises    Aside  Quix  But who is this Knight whom I am to encounter Is he now in the Castle  May  Yes Sir he is now at  Loveland  Castle a Seat of his about ten Miles off He was here the very Day before your Honour came to Town randying for a Knight of his Acquaintance with no less than Six Hundred Freeholders at his Heels  Quix  Humph those are a sort of Soldiers I never heard of in  Spain  How were they arm'd  May  Arm'd Sir  Quix  Ay with Carbines with Muskets Spears Pistols Swords or how I ask that I may choose proper Weapons to encounter them  May  Ha ha your Honour is pleas'd to be merry why truly Sir they were pretty well arm'd when they went out of Town every Man had four or five Bottles in his Head at least  Quix  Baseborn Cowards who owe their Courage to the Spirit of their Wine But be easy Sir within these two Days not one of them shall be alive  May  Marry Heaven forbid Some of them are as honest Gentlemen as any in the County  Quix  Ha honest and in the Train of the Knight of the  LongPurse  Do I not know him to be a Deflowerer of Virgins a Destroyer of Orphans a Despoiler of Widows a Debaucher of Wives  May  Who Sir  Thomas Loveland  Sir Why you don't know him He's as goodnatur'd civil a Gentleman as a Man may say  Quix  Why then do you petition me against him  May  Nay Sir for that matter let him be as civil as he pleases one Man's Money is as good as another's You seem to be a civil Gentleman too and if you stand against him I don't know which would carry it But this I believe you guess already that he who spends most would not have the least Chance  Quix  Ha Caitif dost thou think I would condescend to be the Patron of a Place so mercenary If my Services cannot procure me the Election dost thou think my Money should make me their Knight What should I get by undertaking the Protection of this City and Castle but Dangers Difficulties Tolls and Inchantments Hence from my Sight or by the peerless  Dulcinea  's Eyes thy Blood shall pay the Affront thou hast given my HonourWas it for this that I was chosen in full Senate the  Patron of la Mancha  Gods to what will Mankind degenerate where not only the vile Necessaries of  Life but even Honours which should be the Reward of Virtue only are to be bought with Money  SCENE IV  Another Chamber  Squire  Badger Scut  his Huntsman    and  Guzzle  Badg  That's it Honey's Oh that's itWhat have you no

Squire and his Master both  Badg  What has the Squire a Master  Guz  I don't know which is Master nor which is Man not I sometimes I think one is Master and then again I think it is t'otherI am sure I had rather be the Squire for he sleeps most and eats most he is as bad as a Grayhound in a House there is no laying down any thing eatable but if you turn your Back slap he has it up As for the Knight as he calls himself he has more to pay for breaking Windows than eating Wou'd I were well rid of him He will sit you sometimes in the Yard to guard the Castle as he calls it but I am afraid his Design is to rob the House if he could catch an Opportunity  I don't understand one Word in ten of what he says he talks of Giants and Castles and Queens and Princesses and Chanters and Magicians and  Dulcineas  he has been a mighty Traveller it seems  Badg  A comical Dog I fansy go give my Service to him tell him I should be glad of his Company go  Guz  I am afraid he is not in any of the best

Parts  Quix  It is not Sir Knight of the  Black Cap  the Business of a KnightErrant to number Time like the inferior Part of Mankind by the Days which he lives but by the Actions he performs perhaps you may have sojourn'd longer here than I Are there many Knights in this Kingdom  Badg  Oh numberlessthere are your Knights and Baron Knights and Knights of the Post and then there are your blue
