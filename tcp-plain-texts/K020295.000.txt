 THE WAY TO KEEP HIM A COMEDY In THREE ACTS As it is perform'd at the TheatreRoyal in  DruryLane  Connubio jungam stabili propriamque dicabo  VIRG  LONDON  Printed for P VALLIANT opposite  Southamptonstreet  in the  Strand  MDCCLX  Price One Shilling and Six Pence  ADVERTISEMENT  A Poem  STREPHON and CHLOE  of Dr SWIFT'S with all due Deference to the Ladies that Poem is mentioned gave the Author the first Idea of a Comedy on this Subject He had not thought sufficiently of it to form any regular Plan when  La Nouvelle Ecole de Femmes  of Monsieur  De Moissy  fell into his Hands There were Circumstances and Sentiments in that Piece which coincided with his Design and he also had some Objections The Husband's visiting a Lady of Fashion under his own Name and passing upon her for an unmarried Man the  Chevalier  's Attempt upon his Friend's Honour without a proper Detection of either of them the Wife singing and dancing about the Stage thro' the whole Last Act in order to reclaim her Husband and his Approbation of it without any other  Denouement  and without any Situations of Embarassment which the Story so naturally tended to were in his Opinion palpable Deficiencies To substitute other Materials to form a Last Act entirely new and to work the whole into an  English  Comedy was the Employment of some vacant Hours in the last Summer Whether he has been able to do it with any tolerable Spirit either in the Dialogue Characters or Fable he now submits to the Decision of the candid Reader He acknowledges the public Candour and he returns his Thanks to Mr  Garrick

There you may see Ma'am what a Husband is a Husband is But here comes one will tell you Here comes Sir  Brilliant Fashion  Ask his Advice Ma'am  Mrs  Love  His AdviceAsk Advice of the Man who has estranged Mr  Lovemore  's Affections from me  Muslin  Well I protect and vow Ma'am I think Sir  Brilliant  a very pretty Gentleman He's the very Pink of the FashionHe dresses fashionably lives fashionably wins your Money fashionably loses his own fashionably and does every thing fashionably and then he is so lively and talks so lively and so much to say and so never at a Loss But here he comes  Enter Sir  Brilliant  singing  Sir  Brill  Mrs  Lovemore  your most obedient very humble Servant But my dear Madam what always in a visavis Party with your  Suivante  You will afford me your Pardon my dear Ma'am if I avow that this does a little wear the Appearance of  Misanthropy  Mrs  Love  Far from it Sir  Brilliant  We were engaged in your Panegyric  Sir  Brill  My Panegyric Then am I come most apropos to give a helping Hand towards making it completeMr  Lovemore  will kiss your Hand presently Ma'am He has not as yet entirely adjusted his Dress In the mean Time I can if you please help you to some Anecdotes which will perhaps enable you to colour your Canvass a little higher  Mrs  Love  I hope you will be sure among those Anecdotes not to omit the egregious Exploit of seducing Mr  Lovemore  entirely from his Wife  She makes a Sign to  Muslin  to go  Sir  Brill  I Ma'am Let me perish Madam  Mrs  Love  Oh Sir I am no Stranger to  Sir  Brill  May Fortune eternally forsake me and Beauty frown on me if ever  Mrs  Love  Don't protest too strongly Sir  Brilliant    Sir  Brill  May I never hold four by Honours  Mrs  Love  Nay but Sir  Sir  Brill  Ma'am I am altogether struck with Amazement May I never taste the dear Delight of breaking a  Pharoah  Bank or bullying the whole Room at a BragParty if ever I was in Thought Word or Deed accessary to his InfidelityI deny all unlawful Confederacy  Mrs  Love  Oh Sir it is in vain to deny  Sir  Brill  Nay but my dear Mrs  Lovemore  give me leaveI alienate the Affections of Mr  Lovemore  Consider Madam how would this tell in  WestminsterHall  Sir  Brilliant Fashion  How say you guilty of this Indictment or not guiltyNot guilty possThus issue is joinedyou enter the Court and in sober Sadness charge the whole plump upon me without a Word as to the how when and whereNo Proof positive there ends the Prosecution  Mrs  Love  But Sir your stating of the Case  Sir  Brill  Dear Ma'am don't interrupt  Mrs  Love  Let me explain this Matter  Sir  Brill  Nay Mrs  Lovemore  allow me fair PlayI am now upon my Defence You will please to consider Gentlemen of the Jury that Mr  Lovemore  is not a Ward  nor I a Guardian that he is his own Master to do as he pleases that Mr  Lovemore  is fond of Gaiety Pleasure and Enjoyment that he knows how to live and if he does not like the Bill of Fare that is catered for him at home he very naturally goes abroad to seek for something more palatable  How say yeGentlemen of the Jury Not guilty There Ma'am you see Not guilty  Mrs  Love  You run on finely Sir  Brilliant  but don't imagine that this bantering Way  Sir  Brill  Acquitted by my Country Ma'am you see fairly acquitted  Mrs  Love  Be it so thenBut you hinted something about Mr  Lovemore  's not liking his Bill of Fare at home I should be glad you would explain that Matter Sir  Sir  Brill  Right Madam very right I did touch upon that Head It was but slightly I did not care in an open Court to enlarge further upon that Mattter But to be plain upon my Word Mrs  Lovemore  for a fine Woman like you to be the Dupe of your own false Delicacy an old fashioned Kind of Sentiment a vulgar Prejudice proscribed by Custom long ago an antiquated Principle of I know not what Renounce it altogether  vivez  Ma'am do like other People of Condition mix with other amiable Ladies who know how to use the Senses  Nature has given them pluck the Fruit that grows around ye and bid adieu to the Reign of the melancholy Pleasures for ever  Mrs  Love  After the very edifying Counsel you give Mr  Lovemore  this loose Strain of yours Sir  Brilliant  is not at all surprizing and Sir your late Project  Sir  Brill  My late Project  Mrs  Love  Yes Sir Not content with leading Mr  Lovemore  into a thousand Dissipations from all conjugal Affection and domestic Happiness you have lately introduced him to your Mrs  Bellmour    Sir  Brill  Ma'am he does not so much as know Mrs  Bellmour  Mrs  Love  Fye upon it Sir  Brilliant  Falsehood is but a poor  Sir  Brill  Falsehood I disdain Ma'am and I Sir  Brilliant Fashion  declare that Mr  Lovemore  your Husband is not acquainted with the Widow  Bellmour  and if he was acquainted What then No ill Consequence could from thence redound to you You don't know that Lady Ma'am But I'll let you into her whole History her whole History Ma'am Pray be seated The Widow

be brought round directlyHow do you do this Morning my Dear Sir  Brilliant  I beg your PardonHow do you do my Dear  With an Air of cold Civility  Mrs  Love  Only a little indisposed in Mind and Indisposition of the Mind is of no sort of Consequence not worth a Cure  Love  I beg your Pardon Mrs  Lovemore  Indisposition of the Mind Sir  Brilliant  that is really a mighty pretty Ring you have on your Finger  Sir  Brill  A Bauble Will you look at it  Mrs  Love  Though I have but few Obligations to Sir  Brilliant  yet I fancy I may ascribe to him the Favour of this Visit Mr  Lovemore  Love  Looking at the Ring  Nay now positively you wrong meI was obliged to you for your civil Enquiries concerning me this Morning and so on my Part I came to return the Compliment before I go abroad Upon my Word 'tis very prettily set  Gives it  Mrs  Love  Are you going abroad Sir  Love  A Matter of BusinessI hate Businessbut Business must be done  Examining his Ruffles  Pray is there any News any News my Dear  Mrs  Love  It would be News to me Sir if you would be kind enough to let me know whether I may expect the Favour of your Company to Dinner  Love  It would be impertinent in me to answer such a Question because I can give no direct positive Answer to it as Things happen perhaps I may perhaps may not But don't let me be of any Inconvenience to you it is not material where a body eats Can I set you down any where Sir  Brilliant  Sir  Brill  I thank you no my Chariot's in waiting I have some Visits to make and shall rattle half the Town over presently  Love  As you will  à ça  your Servant Mrs  Lovemore  My Dear  drawing his Gloves on  I kiss your HandWho waits there  going returns  Apropos you have heard what happened    to  Sir  Brilliant    Sir  Brill  When and where  Love  A Word in your Ear Ma'am with your Permission  Mrs  Love  That cold contemptuous Civility Mr  Lovemore    Love  Pshaw Prithee nowHow can you my Dear That's very peevish now and illnaturedIt is but about a mere Trifle Hark ye  whispers  I lost every Thing I play'd for after you went the  Foreigner  and he understand one another  I beg Pardon Ma'am it was only about an Affair at the Opera  Mrs  Love  The Opera Mr  Lovemore  or any thing is more agreeable than my Company  Love  You wrong me now I declare you wrong me and if it will give you any Pleasure I'll sup at home Can't we meet at the  St Alban  's to Night    aside to  Sir Brilliant  Mrs  Love  I believe I need not tell you what Pleasure that would give me But unless the Pleasure is mutual Mr  Lovemore    Love  Ma'am I I I perceive all the Delicacy of that Sentiment But a a I shall incommode you you possibly may have some private Party and it would be very impolite in me to obstruct your Sehemes of Pleasure Would it not Sir  Brilliant  Laughs  Sir  Brill  It would be gothic to the last Degree Ha ha  Love  Ha ha To be sure for me to be of the Party would look as if we lived together like our Friend Sir  Jealous Hotbrain  and his scolding Wife who are for ever like two GameCocks ready armed to goad and wound one another most heartilyHa ha  Sir  Brill  The very ThingHa ha  Love  So it is so it is  Both stand laughing  Mrs  Love  Very well Gentlemen you have it all to yourselves  Love  Odso  looking at his Watch  I shall be beyond my Time Any Commands into the City Madam  Mrs  Love  Commands I have no Commands Sir  Love  I have an Appointment there at my Banker's Sir Brilliant you know old  Discount    Sir  Brill  What he that was in Parliament  Love  The same  Entire Butt  I think was the Name of the Borough Ha ha ha Ma'am your most obedient Sir  Brilliant  yours Who waits there no Ceremony Your Servant  Exit Singing  Sir  Brill  Bon Voyage  Enter  Muslin  Muslin  Did you call Ma'am  Mrs  Love  Come hither  Muslin    Whispers her  mind what I say  Muslin  I'll do it Madam I'll do it  Exit  Mrs  Love  He's gone to visit this Mrs  Bellmour  I suppose  Sir  Brill  Dear Ma'am how can you take such a Notion in your Head But apropos that brings us back to the little History I was just going to give you of the Widow  Bellmour    Mrs  Love  Proceed Sir  Sir  Brill  The Widow  Bellmour  Ma'am is a Lady who to all the Charms of external Beauty has added such an Elegance of Understanding and such a Vivacity of Wit that it is no Wonder all the pretty Fellows are on their Knees to her Her Person youthful blooming and graceful and then her Manner And so entertaining Such Quickness in her Transition from one thing to another and every thing she does does so become her Does she sit still 'tis an indolent  Venus  before ye Does she move 'tis Beauty walking in conscious Triumph To see her smile and hear her talkI shall glow up into Rapture and fall a raving if I talk a Moment longer about her  Mrs  Love  Pray finish your Picture Sir  Sir  Brill  'Tis from the real Life I assure yeIn short Ma'am she is a Lady that has been abroad has ever kept the best Company and has such a Variety of Talents that Upon my Soul she knows the whole Theory of agreeable Sensations better than all the Philosophers in  Europe    Mrs  Love  And to this Theory she has joined the Practice I presume  Sir  Brill  She has  Mrs  Love  I imagined as much  Sir  Brill  Ma'am  Mrs  Love  You need not affect to be surprized Sir there is no mighty Secret in the Affair My Accounts of the Lady inform  me that she is as you say young and handsome has lived a great deal Abroad buried her Husband there is lately come to Town has taken a House lives at great Expence receives all the Men of Rank and Fortune We all know what the World is apt to infer from these Appearances  Sir  Brill  I am no Stranger to the Way of the World Every Object has its different Aspects its Sidelights and the World is generally goodnatured enough to fix upon the most unfavourable Points of View  Mrs  Love  So then this is another antiquated Prejudice of mine  Sir  Brill  Nothing more certain  Mrs  Love  Oh mighty well Sir She is a very Vestal come exhibit your Portrait A Vestal from your School of Painting will no doubt be very curious  Sir  Brill  My dear Madam consider what you are saying What is your Charge against this Lady That she is amiable Surely Mrs  Lovemore  should be the last Person in the World to reproach her with a Quality which so eminently possesses herself  Mrs  Love  The Gallantry of that Compliment Sir  Brilliant  added to your other Favours  Sir  Brill  What next That she has agreeable Talents What then As Nature is liberal of Talents to but very few she makes a kind of Recompence to those  who have none by conducing to their EntertainmentBut she is young and handsomeSo perishable a Quality might methinks be suffered to bloom without ReproachAy but she has taken a House and sees CompanyIt is what she is intitled to and a fine Picture should be seen by People of Rank and Taste and surely Madam your Sex entrenches upon your own Happiness by not allowing that a Woman may partake of the innocent Pleasures of Life unless she has resigned her Person to a Man and parted with her Liberty  Mrs  Love  And so you would persuade me that Mr  Lovemore  is not acquainted with her  Sir  Brill  Absolutely ignorant of him and I'll tell you further she has such a Generosity of Temper and such a feeling Heart that were she to know him and to know that his Visits gave you Pain she would never be at home for him again  Mrs  Love  Then give me leave Sir If you have so exalted an Opinion of the Lady how comes it that you desist from paying your Addresses in that Quarter  Sir  Brill  Compulsion Ma'amit is not voluntary The Garrison I thought was upon the Point of surrendering but up came my Lord  Etheridge  with his honourable Forces to relieve the TownI thought he was out of the Kingdom but it seems he  is returned I bribed the Chambermaid yesterday and I find he has supplanted me and so all that remains for me is to do justice to the Lady and console myself in the best way I can for my Demerits and the Insufficiency of my Pretensions  Mrs  Love  And am I really to believe all this  Sir  Brill  May the first Woman I put the Question to strike me to the Center with a supercilious Eyebrow if every Syllable is not minutely trueso that you see Ma'am I am not the Cause of your Inquietude There is not on Earth a Man that could be more averse from such a thingnor a Person in the World who more earnestly aspires to prove the tender Esteem he bears yeand Ma'amI have long panted for an OpportunityBy all that's soft she hears me  aside  I have long panted Ma'am for a tender Moment like thiswith all the Ardor of Love which Charms like yours alone could kindle  She rises disconcerted  Were it even at the Expence of my Life  She walks about uneasy  You see my dear Ma'am we both have Cause of Discontent we are both disappointedboth crossed in Loveand so Ma'am the least we can do is both heartily to join to sweeten each other's Cares  Mrs  Love  Sir  Brilliant  I don't understand  angrily  Sir  Brill  If you will pour the Balm of Love on this poor wounded Heart you may have the most delicious Revenge against a Husbandwhofrom his own perverse Inclination his own Inhumanity of Temperhas for a long timeI have seen it Madamwith Vexation seen it Yeshe has long been false to Honour Love and you  Mrs  Love  This Usage Sir you take my Wrongs too much to Heart Sir  walking about  I myself Sir can remedy my own AfflictionsBut this Presumption of yoursupon my word This is the most unparallelled  walks about and flutters her Fan  Sir  Brill  Pray Ma'am don't break your Fandon't break it Ma'amI beg you won't  Mrs  Love  This is the most affronting Come to a fine Pass indeed  She stands looking at her Fan  Intolerable Assurance  Sir  Brill  Now am I in a sweet Condition The Poet has touched it most exquisitely  She views the Sory with attentive Eyes And pities  Procris  while her Lover dies  Mrs  Love  Sir I must desire you will quit my House immediately  Sir  Brill  Don't overheat yourself consider my dear Madam  Mrs  Love  Sir I desire was ever such Rudeness  rings the Bell  Sir  Brill  Ma'am I desistI have done but when you're in a better Humour pray recollect  Mrs  Love  Will no body answer there  Sir  Brill  I retire  "Those eyes that tell us what the Sun is made of  "Those Hills of driven Snow  Enter  Muslin  hastily  Sir  Brill  Ma'am your most obedient  Exit  Muslin  Did you call Ma'am  Mrs  Love  To shew the Gentleman out  walking angrily  Muslin  The Servants are all in the Hall  Mrs  Love  To be insulted thus by his loose confident Carriage  Muslin  As I live and breathe Ma'am if I was as you I would not flutter myself about it  Mrs  Love  About what  Muslin  Lawhat signifies mincing MattersI overheard it all  Mrs  Love  You diddid you  angrily  Muslin  Ma'am  Mrs  Love  It does not signify at present  Muslin  No Ma'am it does not signify and Revenge is sweet I think and by my Troth I don't see why you should stand on Ceremony  with a Husband that stands upon none with you  Mrs  Love  Againprithee Mrs Malapert none of your AdviceHow dare yon talk in this manner to meLet me hear no more of this impertinent Freedom  walks about  Muslin  No Ma'am Its very well Ma'amI have done Ma'am  disconcerted and then she speaks aside  What the Devil is here to doAn unmannerly thing to go for to huss me in this manner  Mrs  Love  Still walking about  To make his Character public and render him the Subject of every TeaTable throughout this Town would only serve to widen the Breach and instead of his Neglect might call forth his Anger and settle at last into a fixed Aversion Lawyers Parting and separate Maintenance would ensue No I must avoid thatif possible I will avoid that What must be done  Muslin  What can she be thinking of now The sulky thing not to be communicative with such a Friend as I amWhat can she meanDid you speak to me Ma'am  Mrs  Love  Suppose I were to try that  Muslin  Muslin  Ma'amNow for it  Mrs  Love  Did  John  follow your Master's Chariot as I ordered  Muslin  He did Ma'am  Mrs  Love  Where is he  Muslin  He's below Ma'am he followed it as far as the Chocolate House in  St James'sStreet  Mrs  Love  Are you sure of that  Muslin  You may rely upon it  Mrs  Love  You heard Sir  Brilliant  deny that Mr  Lovemore  visits at this Widow  Bellmours  Muslin  Lard Ma'am he's as full of Fibs as a  French  Millinerhe does visit there I know it all from  William  I'll be hanged in my own Garters if he does not  Mrs  Love  I know not what to do Heigho I think I'll venture Let my Chair be got ready instantly  Muslin  Your Chair Ma'am Are you going out Ma'am  Mrs  Love  Don't teaze me with your talk but do as I bid youand bring my Capuchin down to the Parlour immediately  Exit

of the First  ACT  ACT II  SCENE  a Room at the Widow  Bellmour's  in which are disposed up and down several Chairs a Toilette a Bookcase and a Harpsicord  Mignionet  her Maid is settling the Toilette  Enter Mrs  Bellmour  reading a Volume of  Pope  Oh blest with Temper whose unclouded Ray  Can make Tomorrow cheerful as Today  She who can own a Sister's Charms and hear  Sighs for a Daughter with unwounded Ear  That never answers till a Husband cools  And if she rules him never shews she rules  Sensible elegant  Pope  Charms by accepting by submitting sways  Yet has her Humour most when she obeys  seems to read on  Mig  Lord love my Mistress She's always so happy and so gay  Mrs  Bell  These charming Characters of Women 'Tis like a Painter's Gallery where one sees the Portraits of all one's AcquaintanceHere  Mignionet  put this Book in its Place  Mig  Yes Ma'am There Ma'am you see your Toilette looks most charmingly  Mrs  Bell  Does it I think it does Apropos where's my new Song Here it lies I must make myself Mistress of it  Plays and sings a little  I believe I shall conquer it presently  rises and goes towards her Toilette  This Hair of mine is always tormenting me always in Disorder and straggling out of its Place I must absolutely subdue this Lock  Mignionet  do you know that this is a very pretty Song 'tis written by my Lord  Etheridge  I positively must learn it before he comes  sings a Line  Do you know  Mignionet  that I think my Lord not wholly intolerable  Mig  Yes Ma'am I know that  Mrs  Bell  Do you  Mig  And if I have any Skill Ma'am I fancy you think him more than tolerable  Mrs  Bell  Really then you think I like him I supposeDo ye think I like him I don't well know how that is and yet I don't know but I do like himnono I don't like him neither not absolutely like but I could like if I had a mind to humour myseifThe Man has a Softness  of Manner an elegant Turn of Thinking and has a Heart has he a Heart yes I think he has and then he is such an Observer of the Mannersand shews the ridiculous of them with so much Humour  Mig  I'll be whipt if you don't get into the Noose before the long Nights are over Without doubt Ma'am my Lord is a pretty Man enoughbut lackaday what o'that You know but very little of him your Acquaintance is but very short  Mrs  Bellmour hums a Tune  Do pray my dear Madam mind what I say for I am at times I assure you very speculative very speculative indeedand I see very plainlyLord Ma'am what am I doing I'm talking to you for your own good and you're all in the Air and no more mind one no no more than if I was nothing at all  Mrs  Bell  Hums a tune still  Why indeed you talk wonderfully well upon the Subject but as I know how the Cards lie and can play the Game myself and as I don't know my Song why abody is inclined to give that the Preference  Sings  Mig  Ma'am I assure you I am none of those Servants that bargain for their Mistress's Inclinationsbut I see you are going to take a Leap in the Dark I don't know what to make of his manner of coming here with his Chair always brought into the Hall and the Curtains drawn close about his Ears  as if May I never be married if I don't believe there is something amiss in the Affair Dear Heart Ma'am if you won't listen to me what signifies my living with you I am of no Service to you  Mrs  Bell  I believe I have conquered the Song  runs to her Glass  How do I look Today Well enough I thinkDo you think I shall play the Fool  Mignionet  and marry my Lord  Mig  You have it Ma'am thro' the very Heart of youI see that  Mrs  Bell  Do you think so May be I may marry and may be not Poor Sir  Brilliant Fashion  what will become of him But I won't think about it  Enter  Pompey  Mrs  Bell  What's the Matter  Pompey  Pom  There's a Lady below in a Chair that desires to know if you are at home Madam  Mrs  Bell  Has the Lady no Name  Pom  She did not tell her Name  Mrs  Bell  How aukward you areWell shew her up  Exit  Pompey  Mig  Had not you better receive the Lady in the DiningRoom Ma'am Things here are in such Confusion  Mrs  Brill  No 'twill do very well here  I dare say it is some body I am intimate with tho' the Boy does not recollect her NameHere she comes  Enter Mrs  Lovemore  They both look with a grave Surprize at each other then curtsey with an Air of distant Civility  Mrs  Bell  Ma'am your most obedient  with a kind of Reserve  Mrs  Love  Ma'am I beg your Pardon for this Intrusion  disconcerted  Mrs  Bell  Pray Ma'am walk in won't you please to be seated  Mignionet  reach a Chair  Mrs  Love  This Chair will do mighty well  Mrs  Bell  I beg you'll sit from the Door I beg you'll sit here Ma'am  Mrs  Lovemore  crosses the Stage and they salute each other  Mrs  Love  I'm afraid this Visit from one unknown to you will be inconvenient and troublesome  Mrs  Bell  Not at all I dare say you need not be at the Trouble of an Apology Would you chuse a Dish of Chocolate  Mrs  Love  Much oblig'd to you Not any  Mrs  Bell  Mignionet  you may withdraw  Exit  Mignionet  Mrs  Love  Tho' I have not the Pleasure of your Acquaintance Ma'am there is a particular Circumstance which has determin'd me to take this Liberty with you for which I intreat your Pardon beforehand  Mrs  Bell  The Request is wholly unnecessarybut a particular Circumstance you sayPray Ma'am to what Circumstance am I indebted for this Honour  Mrs  Love  I shall appear perhaps very ridiculous and indeed I am afraid I have done the most absurd ThingBut Ma'am from the Character you bear for Tenderness of Disposition and Generosity of Sentiment I easily incline to flatter myself that you will not take Offence at any thing and that if it is in your Power you will afford me your Assistance  Mrs  Bell  You may depend upon me  Mrs  Love  I will be very ingenuous Pray Ma'am an't you acquainted with a Gentleman whose Name is  Lovemore  Mrs  Bell  Lovemore  No no such Person in my List  Lovemore  I don't know him Ma'am  Mrs  Love  Ma'am I beg your Pardon I am but where I wasI won't trouble you any further  going  Mrs  Bell  'Tis mighty odd this  aside  Madam I must own my Curiosity is a good deal excited  take's her by the Hand  Pray Ma'am give me leave I beg you will  sit downpray don't think me impertinentmay I beg to know who the Gentleman is  Mrs  Love  You have such an Air of Frankness and Generosity that I will open myself to you I have been married to him these two Years I admired him for his Understanding his Sentiment and Spirit I thought myself as sincerely loved by him as my fond Heart could wish but there is of late such a strange Revolution in his Temper I know not what to make of it Instead of the Looks of Affection and Expressions of Tenderness with which he used to meet me 'tis nothing now but cold averted superficial Civility While abroad he runs on in a wild Career of Pleasure and to my deep Affliction has fix'd his Affections upon another Object  Mrs  Bell  If you mean to consult with me in regard to this Case I am afraid you have made a wrong Choice there is something in her Appearance that affects me  aside  Pray excuse me Ma'am you consider this Matter too deeply Men will prove false and if there is nothing in your Complaint but mere Gallantry on his side upon my word I can't think your Case the worse for that  Mrs  Love  Not the worse  Mrs  Bell  On the contrary much better If his Affections instead of being alienated had been extinguish'd he would have sunk into a downright stupid habitual Insensibility  from which it might prove impossible to recall himIn all Love's Bill of Mortality there is not a more fatal Disorderbut your Husband is not fallen into that WayBy your Account he still has Sentiment and where there is Sentiment there is still Room to hope for an Alteration But in the other Case you have the Pain of seeing yourself neglected and for what for nothing at all the Man has lost all Sense of Feeling and is become to the warm Beams of Wit and Beauty as impenetrable as an Icehouse  Mrs  Lov  I am afraid Ma'am he is too much the Reverse of this too susceptible of Impressions from every beautiful Object  Mrs  Bell  Why so much the better as I told you alreadysome new Idea has struck his Fancy and he will be for a while under the Influence of that  Mrs  Love  How light she makes of it  aside  Mrs  Bell  But it is the Wife's Business to bait the Hook for her Husband with Variety and to draw him daily to herselfThat is the whole Affair I would not make myself uneasy Ma'am  Mrs  Love  Not uneasy when his Indifference does not diminish my Regard for him Not uneasy when the Man I doat on no Longer fixes his Happiness at home  Mrs  Bell  Ma'am you'll give me leave to speak my Mind freelyI have often observ'd when the Fiend Jealousy is rous'd that Women lay out a wonderful deal of Anxiety and Vexation to no Account when perhaps if the Truth were known they shou'd be angry with themselves instead of their Husbands  Mrs  Love  Angry with myself Madam Calumny can lay nothing to my Charge the Virtue of my Conduct Madam  Mrs  Bell  Look ye there nowI wou'd have laid my Life you wou'd be at that that's the Folly of us all But Virtue is out of the Question at presentI mean the want of Address and proper Management It is there that most Women failVirtue alone cannot please the Taste of this Age It is  La Belle Nature  Nature embellish'd by the Advantages of Art that the Men expect nowadays  Mrs  Love  But after being married so long and behaving all that time with such an Equality  Mrs  Bell  Ay that Equality is the Rock so many split uponThe Men are now so immers'd in Luxury that they must have eternal Variety in their Happiness  Mrs  Love  She justifies him  Aside  Mrs  Bell  I'll tell you what I wou'd venture to lay a Pot of Coffee that the Person who now rivals you in your Husband's  Affection does it without your good Qualities and even without your Beauty by the mere Force of agreeable Talents and Assiduity to please  Mrs  Love  I am afraid that Compliment  Mrs  Bell  Let me ask you Ma'am have you ever seen this formidable Person  Mrs  Love  I think I have  Mrs  Bell  What fort of a Woman Pray  Mrs  Love  Formidable indeedShe was describ'd to me as one of charming and rare Accomplishments And that is fatally too trueI can see in her the sensible the spirited the in short in her I see my Ruin  Mrs  Bell  Never throw up the Cards for all that Really Ma'am without Compliment you seem to have all the Qualities that can dispute your Husband's Heart with any Body but the Exertion of those Qualities I am afraid is suppress'dYou'll excuse my FreedomYou shou'd counterwork your Rival by the very same Arts she employs I know a Lady now in your very Situation And what does she do She consumes herself with eternal Jealousy whereas if she wou'd but employ half the Pains she uses in teazing herself to vie vith the Creature that has won her Husband from her to vie with her I say in the Arts of pleasing for it is there a Woman's Pride shou'd be piqued  wou'd she do that take my word for it Victory wou'd declare in her Favour  Mrs  Love  Do you think so Ma'am  Mrs  Bell  Think soI am sure of it for there is this Advantage on her Side that Virtue is an Auxiliary in her Causeand Virtue is the best beautifying Fluid for the Complexion it gives a Lustre to the Features that cannot be equall'd by any Artifice whatever  Mrs  Love  What can this mean I begin to doubt  aside  Mrs  Bell  But even Virtue herself must condescend to call in external AidHer own native Charms wou'd do if Men were perfect but that is not the Case and since Vice can assume Allurements why should not Truth and Innocence have additional Ornaments also  Mrs  Love  I begin to think Sir  Brilliant  has told me truth  aside  Mrs  Bell  I have been married Ma'am and am a little in the SecretIt is much more difficult to keep a Heart than win oneAfter the fatal Words for better for worse the general way with Wives is to relax into Indolence and while they are guilty of no Infidelity they think that is enoughBut they are mistaken there is a great deal wanting an Address a Manner a Desire of pleasing an agreeable Contrast in their Conduct of grave  and gaya favourite Poet of mine  Prior  has expressed this very delicately  Above the fix'd and settled Rules  Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools  The better Part should set before 'em  A Grace a Manner a Decorum  Mrs  Love  But when the natural Temper  Mrs  Bell  The natural Temper must be forc'd Home must be made a Place of Pleasure to the Husband and the Wife must throw infinite Variety into her Manner in short she must as it were multiply herself and appear to him fundry different Women on different OccasionsAnd this I take to be the whole Mystery the Way to keep a ManBut I run on at a strange Rate Well to be sure I'm the giddiest Creature Ma'am will you now give me leave to enquire how I came to have this Favour Who recommended me to your Notice And pray who was so kind as to intimate that I was acquainted with Mr  Lovemore  Mrs  Love  I beg your Pardon for all the Trouble I have given you and I assure you 'tis entirely owing to my being told that his Visits were requent here  Mrs  Bell  His Visits frequent hereThey have imposed upon you I assure youand they have told you perhaps that I have robbed you of Mr  Lovemore  's HeartScandal is always buzzing aboutbut I assure you  I have not meddled with his HeartOh Lud I hear a Rap at the Door I positively won't be at home  Rings a Bell  Enter  Mignionet  Mign  Did you call Madam  Mrs  Bell  I am not at home  Mign  'Tis Lord  Etheridge  Ma'amhe's coming up Stairs the Servants told him you were within  Mrs  Bell  Was ever any thing so cross Tell him there is Company with me and he won't come in  Mignionet  run to him  Mrs  Love  Ma'am I beg I mayn't hinder you  Mrs  Bell  Our Conversation begins to grow interestig and I wou'd not have you go for the World I won't see my Lord  Mrs  Love  I beg you will don't let me prevent I'll step into another Room  Mrs  Bell  Will you be so kindThere is a Study of Books in that Room if you will be so obliging as to amuse yourself there I shall be glad to resume this Conversation againHe sha'n't stay long  Mrs  Love  I beg you will be in no hurry I can wait with Pleasure  Mrs  Bell  This is a Lover of mine and a Husband and a Lover shou'd be treated in the same manner perhaps it will divert you to hear how I manage him I hear him  on the Stairs for Heaven's sake make haste  Mignionet  shew the Way  Mign  This way Madam this way  Exeunt Mrs  Love  and  Mignionet  Mrs  Bell  Let me see how I look to receive him  Runs to her Glass  Enter  Lovemore  with a Star and Ribband as Lord  Etheridge  Mrs  Bell    Looking in her Glass    Lord  Etheridge  Walk in my Lord  Love    Repeats    A heav'nly Image in the Glass appears  To that she bends to that her Eyes she rears  Repairs her Smiles  Mrs  Bell  Repairs her Smiles my Lord I don't like your Application of that Phrase Pray my Lord are my Smiles out of repair like an old House in the Country that wants a Tenant  Love  Nay now that's wresting the Words from their visible IntentionYou can't suppose I thought you want Repair whatever may be the Case Ma'am with regard to the want of a Tenant  Mrs  Bell  And so you think I really want a Tenant And perhaps you imagine too that I am going to put up a Bill  Looking in her Glass  to signify to all Passersby that here is a Mansion to be letWell I swear I don't think it wou'd be a bad Scheme I have a great mind to do so  Love  And he who has the Preference  Mrs  Bell  Will be very happy I know you mean so But I'll let it to none but a single Gentleman that you may depend upon  Love  What the Devil does she mean by that She has not got an Inkling of the Affair I hope  Aside  None else could presume Madam to  Mrs  Bell  And then it must be a Lease for Lifebut no Body will be troubled with it I shall never get it off my HandsDo you think I shall my Lord  Love  Why that Question Madam You know I am devoted to you even if it were to be bought with Life  Mrs  Bell  Heav'ns what a dying Swain you are And does your Lordship really intend to be guilty of Matrimony Lord what a Question have I askedWell to be sure I am a very MadcapMy Lord don't you think me a strange Madcap  Love  A Wildness like yours that arises from Vivacity and Sentiment together serves only to exalt your Beauty and give new Poignancy to every Charm  Mrs  Bell  Well upon my word you have said it finelyBut you are in the right my Lord I hate your pensive melancholy Beauty that sits like a wellgrown Vegetable in a Room for an Hour together 'till at last she is animated to the violent Exertion of  saying yes or no and then enters into a MatterofFact Conversion "Have you heard the News Miss  Beverly  is going to be married to Captain  Shoulderknot  My Lord  Mortgage  has had another Tumble at  Arthur  's Sir  William Squanderstock  has lost his Election They say short Aprons are coming into Fashion again"  Love  Oh Lord a MatterofFact Conversation is insupportable  Mrs  Bell  Pray my Lord have you ever observed the manner of one Lady's accosting another at  Ranelagh  She comes up to you with a demure Look of insipid Serenity makes you a solemn Salute "Ma'am I am overjoyed to meet you you look charmingly But dear Madam did you hear what happened to us all the other Night We were going home from the Opera Ma'amyou know my Aunt  RolyPoly  It was her Coach there was she and Lady  Betty Fidget  Your most obedient Servant Ma'am  Curtseying to another as it were going by  Lady  Betty  you know is recovered every Body thought it over with herbut Doctor  Snakeroot  was called in no not Doctor  Snakeroot  Doctor  Bolus  it was and so he altered the Course of the Medicinesand so my Lady  Betty  recovered well there was she and Sir  George Bragwell  a pretty Man Sir  George  finest Teeth in

How do you do MadamThe Villain of a Coachman overturned us allmy Aunt  RolyPoly  was frightened out of her Wits and Lady  Betty  has been  nervish  ever sinceOnly think of thatsuch Accidents in LifeMa'am your most obedientI am proud to see you look so well"  Love  An exact Description the very thingha ha  Mrs  Bell  And then from this Conversation they all run to Cards  "Quadrille has murdered Wit"  Love  Ay and Beauty too for upon these Occasions "the Passions in the Features are" I have seen many a beautiful Countenance change in a Moment into absolute Deformity the little Loves and Graces that before sparkled in the Eye bloom'd in the Cheek and smil'd about the Mouth all fly off in an Instant and resign the Features which they before adorn'd to Fear to Anger to Grief and the whole Train of fretful Passions  Mrs  Bell  Ay and the Rage we poor Women are often betrayed into on these Occasions  Love  Very true Ma'am and if by chance they do bridle and hold in a little the Struggle they undergo is the most ridiculous Sight  imaginable I have seen an Oath quivering upon the pale Lip of a reigning Toast for Half an Hour together yes and I have seen an uplifted Eye blaspheming Providence for the Loss of an odd Trickand then at last when the whole Room burst out into one loud universal Uproar"My Lord you flung away the GameNo Ma'am it was youSir  George  why did not you rough the Diamond Capt  Hazard  why did not you lead through the Honour Ma'am it was not the Play Pardon me Sir But Ma'amBut Sir I would not play with you for StrawsDon't you know what  Hoyle  says If A and B are Partners against C and D and the Game Nineall A and B have won three Tricks and C and D four Tricks C leads his Suit D puts up the King then returns the Suit A passes C puts up the Queen B roughs the next" and so A and B and C and D are bang'd about and all is Jargon Confusion Uproar and Wrangling and Nonsense and Noise Ha ha  Mrs  Bell  Ha ha A fine Picture of a Rout but one must play fometimes we must let our Friends pick our Pockets sometimes or they'll drop our Acquaintance Pray my Lord do you never play  Love  Play Ma'am I must lie to the End of the Chapter  aside  play now and then out of Necessity otherwise I never touch a Card  Mrs  Bell  Oh very true you dedicate your Time to the Muses a downright rhyming Peer Do you know my Lord that I am charm'd with your Song  Love  Are you  Mrs  Bell  I am indeedI think you'd make a very tolerable  Vauxball  Poet  Love  You flatter me Ma'am  Mrs  Bell  No as I live and breathe I don't and do you know that I can sing it already Come you shall hear me you shall hear it  sings  I  Attend all ye Fair and I'll tell ye the Art  To bind every Fancy with ease in your Chains  To hold in soft Fetters the conjugal Heart  And banish from  Hymen  his Doubts and his  Pains  II  When  Juno  accepted the Cestus of Love  At first she was handsome she charming became  With Skill the soft Passions it taught her to move  To kindle at once and to keep up the Flame  III  'Tis this gives the Eyes all their Magic and Fire  The Voice melting Accents impassions the Kiss  Confers the sweet Smiles that awaken Desire  And plants round the Fair each Incentive to Bliss  IV  Thence flows the gay Chat more than Reason that charms  The eloquent Blush that can Beauty improve  The fond Sigh the fond Vow the' soft Touch that alarms  The tender Disdain the Renewal of Love  V  Ye Fair take the Cestus and practise it's Art  The Mind unaccomplish'd mere Features are vain  Exert your sweet Power you conquer each Heart  And the Loves Joys and Graces shall walk in your Train  Love  My Poetry is infinitely oblig'd to you for the Embellishments your Voice and Manner confer upon it  Mrs  BelL  Oh fulsomeI sing horridly and I look horridly  goes to the Glass  How do I look my Lord but don't tell me I won't be told I see you are studying a Compliment and I hate Compliments well what is it let's hear your Compliment why don't you compliment me I won't hear it now But pray now how came you to choose so grave a Subject as connubial HappinessDo you think there is any such Thing on Earth as connubial Happiness  Love  Close and particular that Question  aside  Why Ma'am in general one does not see the Talents of a Wife dedicated to the Happiness of the HusbandI have known Ladies who on the Eve of their Wedding appear'd like the very Graces in a few Weeks after the Ceremony become very Slatterns both in their Persons and Understandings no Solicitude on their side to appear amiable Distaste insinuates itself by degrees into the Husband's Mind the Bands of  Hymen  grow loose and thus with perhaps the best Disposition in the World he is oblig'd to start wild and away he urges where Youth and a Career of Spirits hurry him and so goodnight to all real and solid Happiness But with one accomplish'd as you are Ma'am  Mrs  Bell  To be sure with me nobody cou'd be otherwise than happy was not that what you was going to say I know it was Well upon my word you have drawn your Picture so well that one would imagine you had a Wife at home to sit for it  Love  Ma'am  embarrass'd  the Compliment a you are but laughing at meI I I Zouns I am afraid she begins to smoke me  aside  A very scanty Knowledge of the World will serve and and there is no need of one's own Experience in these Casesnor had I talk'd so were I not  persuaded you will make an Exception to the general Rule  Mrs  Bell  O lard you are going to plague me again with your odious Solicitations but I won't hear 'em you must be gone If I should be weak enough to listen to you what would become of Sir  Brilliant Fashion  Love  Sir  Brilliant Fashion  Mrs  Bell  Yes don't you know Sir  Brilliant Fashion  Love  No Ma'am I don't know the Gentleman I beg Pardon if he is your Acquaintance but from what I have heard of him I shou'd not choose him to be among my Intimates  Enter  Mignionet  in a violent Hurry  Mig  O Lud I am frighted out of my Senses The poor LadyWhere's the Hartshorndrops  Love  The Lady What Lady  Mign  Never stand asking what Lady she has fainted away Ma'am all of a sudden Give me the Drops  Mrs  Bell  Let me run to her Assistance Adieu my LordI shall be at home in the Evening  Mignionet  step this WayMy Lord you'll excuse me I expect you in the Evening  Exit  Lovemore  I shall wait on you Ma'am What Villain am I to carry on this Scheme  against so much Beauty Innocence and MeritAy and to have the Impudence to assume this Badge of Honour to cover the most unwarrantable PurposesBut no Reflection have her I must and that quickly tooIf I don't prevail soon I'm undone she'll find me outEgad I'll be with her betimes this Evening and press her with all the Vehemence of Love Women have their soft unguarded Moments and who knows But to take the Advantage of the Openness and Gaiety of her Heart and then my Friend Sir  Brilliant  will it be fair to supplant himPrithee be quiet my dear Conscience don't you be meddling don't interrupt a Gentleman in his Amusements Don't you know my good Friend that Love has no Respect of Persons knows no Laws of Frienshipbesides 'tis all my Wife's Fault why don't she strive

Etheridge  your Husband  Mrs  Love  Lord  Etheridge  as he calls himself and as you have been made to call him also is no other than Mr  Lovemore  Mrs  Bell  And has he then been base enough to assume that Title to ensnare me to my undoing  Mign  Well for certain I believe the Devil's in me I am certainly a Witch for I always thought him a sly one  Mrs  Love  To see my Husband carrying on this dark Businessto see the Man I have loved the Man I have esteem'd the Man I am afraid I must still love tho'  esteem him again I cannot to be a Witness to his complicated Wickednessit was too much for Sensibility like mineI felt the Shock too severelyand sunk under it  Mrs  Bell  I am ready to do the same myself now I sink into the very Ground with Amazement The first time I ever saw him was at old Mrs  Loveit  's she introduc'd him to methe Appointment was of her own making  Mrs  Love  You know her Character I suppose Madam  Mrs  Bell  She's a Woman of Fashion and sees a great deal of good Company  Mrs  Love  Very capable of such an Action for all that  Mrs  Bell  Well I cou'd never have imagin'd that any Woman wou'd be so base as to pass such a Cheat upon me Step this Moment and give Orders never to let him within my Doors again  To her Maid who goes out  I am much oblig'd to you Ma'am for this Visit To me it is highly fortunate but I am sorry for your Share in't as the Discovery

Heavens bless her for a sweet Woman And a Plague go with him for an inhuman barbarous bloody murdering Brute  Mrs  Love  No more of these Liberties I desire  Muslin  Nay don't be angrythey did say so indeedBut dear Heart how every Body will be overjoy'd when they find you have pluck'd up a littleas for me it gives me new Life to have so much Company in the House and such a Racketing at the Door with Coaches and Chairs enough to hurry a Body out of one's WitsLard this is another thing and you look quite like another thing Ma'am and that Dress so becomes you I suppose Ma'am you'll never wear your Negligee again It is not fit for you indeed Ma'amIt might pass very well with some Folks Ma'am but the like of you  Mrs  Love  Prithee truce with your Tongue and see who is coming up Stairs

Gaiety I have at the Bottom but an aching Heart  Mrs  Bell  Be rul'd by me and I'll answer for the Event Why really now you look just as you shou'd do Why shou'd you neglect so fine a Figure  Mrs  Love  You are so civil Mrs  Bellmour    Mrs  Bell  And so true too what was beautiful before is now heightened by the additional Ornaments of Dress and if you will but animate and inspire the whole by those Graces of the Mind which I am sure you possess the Impression cannot fail of being effectual upon all Beholders and even upon the depraved Mind of Mr  Lovemore  You have not heard any thing of him since have you  Mrs  Love  No no Account at all of him  Mrs  Bell  I can tell you something He has been at my House You know I had promis'd to be at home for him not being let in my Servants tell

youthful Loves and blooming Graces all unfelt neglected and despis'd by a tasteless cold languid unimpassion'd Husband while they might be all so much better employ'd to the Purposes of Extacy and Bliss  Mrs  Love  I am amaz'd Sir at this Libertywhat Action of my Life has authoriz'd such barefac'd Assurance and for what Reason do you think so meanly of me as to imagine that I have not a greater Regard for my Reputation and for what the World may say Sir  Sir  Brill  The World Ma'amthe World will justify youshe serv'd him right they will all agree in itthere will be but one Opinion about it that is Ma'am if the World should know itbut our Loves may be as concealed as Secrets undiscover'd yet by mortal Eye By all that's soft it goes down with her like a Dish of Tea  aside  And so Madam

Consequences that might follow I should not hesitate a Moment to acquaint Mr  Lovemore  with your whole Behaviour  Sir  Brill  She won't tell her Husband then charming Creature and Blessings on her

Confidence to look me in the Face  Sir  Brill  I was telling your Lady here of the most whimsical Adventure  Love  Don't add the Meanness of Falshood to the black Attempt of invading your Friend's Happiness I did imagine Sir from the long Intercourse that has subsisted between us that you might have had Delicacy enough Feeling enough Honour enough Sirnot to meditate an Injury like this  Sir  Brill  Ay ay it's all over I'm detected  aside  Mr  Lovemore  if begging your Pardon for this Rashness will any ways atone  Love  No Sir nothing can atone The Provocation you have given me wou'd

humble Servant Sir  Love  I can't bear to feel my myself in so ridiculous a Circumstance  aside  Mrs  Bell  I beg my Compliments to your Friend Mrs  Leveit  and I am much oblig'd to you both for your very honourable Desigs  curtseying to him  Love  I never was so asham'd in all my Life  Sir  Brill  So so so all his Pains were to hide the Star from meThe Discovery is a perfect Cordial to my dejected Spirits  Mrs  Bell  Mrs  Lovemore  I cannot sufficiently acknowledge the Providence that directed you to pay me a Visit tho' I was wholly unknown to you and I shall henceforth consider you as my Deliverer  Love  Zoons It was she that fainted away in the Closet and be damn'd to her Jealousy  aside  Sir  Brill  By all that's whimsical an odd sort of an Adventure this my Lord  advances to him  My Lord my Lord  Etheriage  as the Man says in the Play "Your Lordship's right welcome back to  Denmark"  Love  Now he comes upon meOh I'm in a fine Situation  aside  Sir  Brill  My Lord I hope that ugly Pain in your Lordship's Side is abated  Love  Absurd and ridiculous  aside  Sir  Brill  There is nothing forming there I hope my Lord  Mrs  Love  apart with Mrs  Bellmour  I begin now to feel for him and to pity his Uneasiness  Sir  Brill  Pray my Lord don't you think it a base Thing to invade the Happiness of a Friend Or to do him a clandestine Wrong or to injure him with the Woman he loves  Love  To cut the Matter short with you Sir we are both Rascals  Sir  Brill  Rascal  Love  Ay both We are two very pretty Fellows indeed  Mrs  Bell  I am glad to find that you are at length awaken'd into a Sense of your Error    to  Lovemore  Love  I am Madam and I am frank enough to own it I am above attempting to disguise my Feelings when I am conscious they are on the Side of Truth and Honour and Madam with a true Remorse I ask your Pardon  Mrs  Bell  Upon certain Terms I don't know but I may sign and seal your Pardon  Love  Terms What Terms  Mrs  Bell  That you make due Expiation of your Guilt to that Lady  Love  That Lady Ma'am That Lady has no Reason to complain  Mrs  Love  No Reason to complain Mr Lovemore  Love  No Madam none for whatever may have been my Imprudences they have had their Source in your Conduct  Mrs  Love  In my Conduct Sir  Love  In your ConductI here declare before this Company and I am above palliating the Matter I here declare that no Man in  England  cou'd be better inclin'd to domestic Happiness if you Madam on your Part had been willing to make Home agreeable  Mrs  Love  There I confess he touches me  aside  Love  You cou'd take Pains enough before Marriage you would put forth all your Charmspractice all your Artsand make your Features please by Rulefor ever changing running an eternal Round of Variety And all this to win my Affections But when you had won them you did not think them worth your keeping Never dress'd pensive silent melancholyand the only Entertainment in my House was the dear Pleasure of a dull conjugal  TeteaTete  and all this Insipidity because you think the sole Merit of a Wife consists in her VirtueA fine Way of amusing a Husband truly  Sir  Brill  Upon my Soul and so it is  laughing  Enter  Muslin  Muslin  O Gemini Gemini here's such a Piece of workwhat shall I do my poor dear Lady  Crying bitterly  Love  Is the Woman crazy  Muslin  Oh Madam forgive me my dear MadamI did not do it on purpose as I hope for Mercy I did not  Mrs  Love  What did not you do  Muslin  I did not intend to give it him I would have seen him gibbetted first I found the Letter in the Parlour Madam I knew it was the same Letter I had deliver'd to you and my Curiosity did make me peep into it Says my Curiosity "Now  Muslin  you may gratify yourself by finding out the Contents of that Letter which you have such a violent Itching for" My Curiosity said so Ma'am and then I own Ma'am my Respect for you did say to me "Hussey how dare you meddle with what does not belong to you keep your Distance and let your Mistress's Secrets alone"But then upon that in comes my Curiosity again and says my Curiosity "Read it I tell you  Muslin  a Woman of Spirit shou'd know every thing""Let it alone you Jade" says my Respect"It's as much as your Place is worth""There's more Places than one" says my Curiosity "and so read it I tell you  Muslin"  I did read it  what could I do Heaven help me I did read itI don't go to deny itI don't I don't  Crying  Love  Don't keep such an Uproar Woman  Muslin  And then after I read it thinks me I I'll give this to my Mistress directly and that persidious thing her Husband shall not see it and so as my ill Stars would wou'd have it as I was looking for you I run my hand full in the Lion's mouth  Crying  Sir  Brill  What an unlucky Jade it has been  aside  Mrs  Love  Well have done  Muslin  this is too much  Mrs  Bell  Upon my word but she gives him his ownI suppose you own the Truth of what she says Mr  Lovemore  Love  Pray Madam does that Lady own the Truth of what I have said  Mrs  Love  Sir I am sensible there is too much Truth in what you say this Lady has open'd my Eyes and convinc'd me that there was a Mistake in my former Conduct  Love  Come come you need not say any moreI forgive youI forgive you  Mrs  Love  Forgive me I like that Air of Confidence when you know that on my Side it is at worst an Error in Judgment whereas on yours  Mrs  Bell  Come come you know each other's Faults and Virtues and so you have nothing to do but to mend the former and enjoy the latterThere there kiss and FriendsThere Mrs  Lovemore  take your reclaim'd Libertine to your Arms  Love  It is in your Power Madam to make a reclaim'd Libertine of me indeed  Mrs  Love  From this Moment it shall be our mutual Study to please each other  They embrace  Sir  Brill Lovemore  may I presume to hope for Pardon at that Lady's Hands  Love  My dear Confederate in Vice your Pardon is grantedTwo sad Dogs we have beenbut come give us your Handwe have us'd each other damnablyfor the future we will endeavour to make each other amends  Sir  Brill  And so we willMa'am since my Lord decamps from before the Town may I presume to hope  Mrs  Bell  I positively forbid you the least Grain of Hope whenever I take to myself a Husband I must be convinc'd first that he will answer the Trouble of keeping him  Sir  Brill  My dear Ma'am by all that's  Mrs  Bell  No SwearingI positively will have my own way you shall perform Quarantine before I speak to you again  Love  She's your's Man she's your's she'll throw herself into your Arms in a Day or two And now I heartily congratulate the whole Company that this Business has had so happy a Tendency to convince each of us of our Folly  Mrs  Bell  Pray Sir don't draw me into Share of your Folly  Love  Come come my dear Ma'am you are not without your Share of it This will teach you for the future to be content with one Lover at a time without listening to a Fellow you know nothing of because he assumes a Title and reports well of himself  Mrs  Bell  The Reproof is just I grant it  Love  Come let us join the Company chearfully keep our own Secrets and not make ourselves a TownTalk though I don't know but if this Transaction were sent abroad into the World it might prove a very useful Lesson The Men wou'd see how their Paffions may carry them into the Danger of wounding the Bosom of a Friend the Ladies wou'd learn that after the Marriage Rites they shou'd not suffer their Powers of pleasing to languish away but shou'd still remember to sacrifice to the Graces  To win a Man when all your Pains succeed  The Way to Keep Him is a Task indeed  FINIS  Just Publish'd  Price s d  Adorned with a neat Frontispiece  THE DESERT ISLAND A Dramatic Poem In Three Acts As it is now performing at the TheatreRoyal in  DruryLane
