ibid  MEMOIRS of the AUTHOR  THE enthusiasm of poetry like that of religion has frequently a powerful influence on the conduct of life and either throws it into the retreat of uniform obscurity or marks it with irregularities that lead to misery and disquiet The gifts of imagination bring the heaviest task upon the vigilance of reason and to bear those faculties with unerring rectitude or invariable propriety requires a degree of firmness and of cool attention which doth not always attend the higher gifts of the mind Yet difficult as nature herself seems to have rendered the task of regularity to genius it is the supreme consolation of  dulness  and  folly  to point with gothic triumph to these excesses which are the overflowings of faculties they never enjoyed Perfectly unconscious that they are indebted to their stupidity for the consistency of their conduct they plume themselves on an imaginary virtue which has its origin in what is really their disgraceLet such if such dare approach the shrine of COLLINS withdraw to a respectful distance and should they  behold the ruins of genius or the weakness of an exalted mind let them be taught to lament that nature has left the noblest of their works imperfect  OF such men of genius as have borne no public character it seldom happens that any memoirs can be collected of consequence enough to be recorded by the biographer If their lives pass in obscurity they are generally too uniform to engage our attention if they cultivate and obtain popularity envy and malignity will mingle their poison with the draughts of praise and through the industry of those unwearied fiends their reputation will be so chequered and their characters so disguised that it shall become difficult for the historian to separate truth from falshood  OF our exalted poet whose life though far from being popular did not altogether pass in privacy we meet with few other accounts than such as the life of every man will afford  viz  when he was born where he was educated and where he died Yet even these simple memoirs of the man will not be unacceptable to those who admire the poet for we never receive pleasure without a desire to be acquainted with the source from whence it springs a species of curiosity which as it seems  to be instinctive was probably given us for the noble end of gratitude and finally to elevate the enquiries of the mind to that fountain of perfection from which all human excellence is derived  CHICHESTER a city in Sussex had the honour of giving birth to the author of the following poems about the year His father who was a reputable tradesman in that city intended him for the service of the church and with this view in the year he was admitted a scholar of that illustrious seminary of genius and learning Winchester college where so many distinguished men of letters so many excellent poets have received their classical education Here he had the good fortune to continue seven years under the care of the very learned Dr Burton and at the age of nineteen in the year he had merit sufficient to procure a distinguished place in the list of those scholars who are elected upon the foundation of Winchester to New College in Oxford But as there were then no vacancies in that society he was admitted a commoner of Queen's College in the same university where he continued till July when he was elected a demy of Magdalen College During his residence at Queen's he was at once distinguished for genius and indolence his  exercises when he could be prevailed upon to write bearing the visible characteristics of both This remiss and inattentive habit might probably arise in some measure from disappointment he had no doubt indulged very high ideas of the academical mode of education and when he found science within the fetters of logic and of Aristotle it was no wonder if he abated of his diligence to scek her where the search was attended with artificial perplexities and where at last the pursuer would grasp the shadow for the substance  WHILE he was at Magdalen College he applied himself chiefly to the cultivation of poetry and wrote the epistle to Sir Thomas Hanmer and the Oriental Eclogues which in the year were published under the title of  Persian Eclogues  The success of these poems was far from being equal to their merit but to a novice in the pursuit of fame the least encouragement is sufficient if he does not at once acquire that reputation to which his merit intitles him he embraces the encomiums of the few forgives the many and intends to open their eyes to the striking beauties of his next Publication  WITH prospects such as these probably Mr Collins indulged his fancy when in the year  after having taken the degree of a batchelor of arts he left the university and removed to London  To a man of small fortune a liberal spirit and uncertain dependencies the metropolis is a very dangerous place Mr Collins had not been long in town before he became an instance of the truth of this observation His pecuniary resources were exhausted and to restore them by the exertion of genius and learning though he wanted not the power he had neither steadiness nor industry His necessities indeed sometimes carried him as far as a scheme or a title page for a book but whether it were the power of dissipation or the genius of repose that interfered he could proceed no farther Several books were projected which he was very able to execute and he became in idea an historian a critic and a dramatic poet by turns At one time he determined to write an history of the revival of Letters at another to translate and comment upon Aristotle's Poetics then he turned his thoughts to the Drama and proceeded so far towards a tragedyas to become acquainted with the manager  UNDER this unaccountable dissipation he suffered the greatest inconveniencies Day succeeded day for the support of which he had made no provision and in which he was to subsist either by the  longrepeated contributions of a friend or the generosity of a casual acquaintanceYet indolence triumphed at once over want and shame and neither the anxieties of poverty nor the heartburning of dependance had power to animate resolution to perseverance  As there is a degree of depravity into which if a man falls he becomes incapable of attending to any of the ordinary means that recall men to virtue so there are some circumstances of indigence so extremely degrading that they destroy the influences of shame itself and most spirits are apt to sink under their oppression into a sullen and unambitious despondence  HOWEVER this might be with regard to Mr Collins we find that in the year he had spirit and resolution enough to publish his  Odes descriptive and allegorical  Mr MILLAR a bookseller in the  Strand  and a favourer of genius  when once it has made its way to same  published them ON THE AUTHOR'S ACCOUNTHe happened indeed to be in the right not to publish them on his own for the sale was by no means successful and hence it was that the author conceiving a just indignation against a blind and tasteless age burnt the remaining copies with his own hands  ALLEGORICAL and abstracted poetry was above the taste of those times as much or more than it is of the present It is in the lower walks the plain and practical paths of the muses only that the generality of men can be entertained The higher efforts of imagination are above their capacity and it is no wonder therefore if the Odes descriptive and allegorical met with few admirers  UNDER these circumstances so mortifying to every just expectation when neither his wants were relieved nor his reputation extended he found some consolation in changing the scene and visiting his uncle colonel MARTIN who was at that time with our army in Flanders Soon after his arrival the colonel died and left him a considerable fortune  HERE then we should hope to behold him happy possessed of independence and removed from every scene and every monument of his former misery But fortune had delayed her favours till they were not worth receiving His faculties had been so long harrassed by anxiety dissipation and distress that he fell into a nervous disorder which brought with it an unconquerable depression of spirits and at length reduced the finest understanding to the most deplorable childishness In the first  stages of his disorder he attempted to relieve himself by travel and passed into France but the growing malady obliged him to return and having continued with short intervals  It seems to have been in one of these intervals that he was visited by an ingenious friend who tells us he found him with a book in his hand and being asked what it was he answered that "he had but one book but that was the best" It was the NewTestament in English  in this pitiable state till the year he died in the arms of a sister at Chichester  MR Collins was in stature somewhat above the middle size of a brown complexion keen expressive eyes and a sixed sedate aspect which from intense thinking had contracted an habitual frown His prosiciency in letters was greater than could have been expected from his years He was skilled in the learned languages and acquainted with the  Italian French  and  Spanish  It is observable that none of his poems bear the marks of an amorous disposition and that he is one of those few poets who have sailed to Delphi without touching at Cythera The allusions of this kind that appear in his Oriental Eclogues were indispensable in that species of poetry and it is very remarkable that in his  Passions  an ode for music love is omitted though it should have made a principal figure there  ORIENTAL ECLOGUES  ECLOGUE I  SELIM or the SHEPHERD'S MORAL  SCENE a valley near BAGDAT  Time the Morning  YE Persian maids attend your poet's lays  And hear how shepherds pass their golden days  Not all are blest whom fortune's hand sustains  With wealth in courts nor all that haunt the plains  Well may your hearts believe the truths I tell  'Tis virtue makes the bliss where'er we dwell  Thus Selim sung by sacred truth inspir'd  Nor praise but such as truth bestow'd desir'd  Wise in himself his meaning songs conveyed  Informing morals to the shepherd maid  Or taught the swains that surest bliss to find  What groves nor streams bestow a virtuous mind  When sweet and blushing like a virgin bride  The radiant morn resum'd her orient pride  When wanton gales along the valleys play  Breathe on each flower and bear their sweets away  By Tigris' wand'ring waves he sat and sung  This useful lesson sor the fair and young  Ye Persian dames he said to you belong  Well may they please the morals of my song  No fairer maids I trust than you are found  Grac'd with soft arts the peopled world around  The morn that lights you to your loves supplies  Each gentler ray delicious to your eyes  For you those flowers her fragrant hand bestow  And yours the love that kings delight to know  Yet think not these all beauteous as they are  The best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair  Who trust alone in beauty's feeble ray  Boast but the worth Bassora's pearls display  Drawn from the deep we own their surface bright  But dark within they drink no lustrous light  Such are the maids and such the charms they boast  By sense unaided or to virtue lost  Selfflattering sex your hearts believe in vain  That love shall blind when once he fires the swain  Or hope a lover by your faults to win  As spots on ermin beautify the skin  Who seeks secure to rule be first her care  Each softer virtue that adorns the fair  Each tender passion man delights to find  The lov'd perfections of a female mind  Blest were the days when Wisdom held her reign  And shepherds sought her on the silent plain  With Truth she wedded in the secret grove  Immortal Truth and daughters bless'd their love  O haste fair maids ye Virtues come away  Sweet Peace and Plenty lead you on your way  The balmy shrub for you shall love our shore  By Ind excell'd or Araby no more  Lost to our fields for so the fates ordain  The dear deserters shall return again  Come thou whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear  To lead the train sweet Modesty appear  Here make thy court amidst our rural scene  And shepherdgirls shall own thee for their queen  With thee be Chastity of all afraid  Distrusting all a wise suspicious maid  But man the mostnot more the mountain doe  Holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe  Cold is her breast like flowers that drink the dew  A silken veil conceals her from the view  No wild desires amidst thy train be known  But Faith whose heart is fix'd on one alone  Dcsponding Meekness with her downcast eyes  And friendly Pity full of tender sighs  And Love the last by these your hearts approve  These are the virtues that must lead to love  Thus sung the swain and ancient legends say  The maids of Bagdat verified the lay  Dear to the plains the Virtues came along  The shepherds lov'd and Selim bless'd his song  ECLOGUE II  HASSAN or the CAMELDRIVER  SCENE the DESERT  Time Midday  IN silent horror o'er the boundless waste  The driver Hassan with his camels past  One cruise of water on his back he bore  And his light scrip contain'd a scanty store  A fan of painted feathers in his hand  To guard his shaded face from scorching sand  The sultry sun had gain'd the middle sky  And not a tree and not an herb was nigh  The beasts with pain their dusty way pursue  Shrill roar'd the winds and dreary was the view  With desperate sorrow wild th' affrighted man  Thrice sigh'd thrice struck his breast and thus began  "Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  "When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  Ah little thought I of the blasting wind  The thirst or pinching hunger that I find  Bethink thee Hassan where shall Thirst assuage  When fails this cruise his unrelenting rage  Soon shall this scrip its precious load resign  Then what but tears and hunger shall be thine  Ye mute companions of my toils that bear  In all my griefs a more than equal share  Here where no springs in murmurs break away  Or mosscrown'd fountains mitigate the day  In vain ye hope the green delights to know  Which plains more blest or verdant vales bestow  Here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found  And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around  "Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  "When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  Curst be the gold and silver which persuade  Weak men to follow farfatiguing trade  The lilly peace outshines the silver store  And life is dearer than the golden ore  Yet money tempts us o'er the desert brown  To every distant mart and wealthy town  Full oft we tempt the land and oft the sea  And are we only yet repay'd by thee  Ah why was ruin so attractive made  Or why fond man so easily betray'd  Why heed we not while mad we haste along  The gentle voice of peace or pleasure's song  Or wherefore think the flowery mountain's side  The fountain's murmurs and the valley's pride  Why think we these less pleasing to behold  Than dreary deserts if they lead to gold  "Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  "When first srom Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  O cease my fearsall frantic as I go  When thought creates unnumber'd scenes of woe  What if the lion in his rage I meet  Oft in the dust I view his printed feet  And fearful oft when day's declining light  Yields her pale empire to the mourner night  By hunger rous'd he scours the groaning plain  Gaunt wolves and sullen tygers in his train  Before them death with shrieks directs their way  Fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey  "Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  "When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  At that dead hour the silent asp shall creep  If aught of rest I find upon my sleep  Or some swoln serpent twist his scales around  And wake to anguish with a burning wound  Thrice happy they the wise contented poor  From lust of wealth and dread of death secure  They tempt no deserts and no griefs they find  Peace rules the day where reason rules the mind  "Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  "When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  O hapless youth for she thy love hath won  The tender Zara will be most undone  Big swell'd my heart and own'd the powerful maid  When fast she dropt her tears as thus she said  "Farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain  "Whom Zara's breaking heart implor'd in vain  "Yet as thou go'st may every blast arise  "Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs  "Safe o'er the wild no perils may'st thou see  "No griefs endure nor weep false youth like me"  O let me safely to the fair return  Say with a kiss she must not shall not mourn  O let me teach my heart to lose its fears  Recall'd by Wisdom's voice and Zara's tears  He said and call'd on heaven to bless the day  When back to Schiraz' walls he bent his way  ECLOGUE III  ABRA or the GEORGIAN SULTANA  SCENE a FOREST  Time the Evening  IN Georgia's land where Tefflis' towers are seen  In distant view along the level green  While evening dews enrich the glittering glade  And the tall forests cast a longer shade  What time 'tis sweet o'er fields of rice to stray  Or scent the breathing maize at setting day  Amidst the maids of Zagen's peaceful grove  Emyra sung the pleasing cares of love  Of Abra first began the tender strain  Who led her youth with flocks upon the plain  At morn she came those willing flocks to lead  Where lilies rear them in the watery mead  From early dawn the livelong hours she told  'Till late at silent eve she penn'd the fold  Deep in the grove beneath the secret shade  A various wreath of odorous flowers she made  That these flowers are found in very great abundance in some of the provinces of Persia see the modern history of Mr Salmon  Gaymotley'd pinks and sweet jonquils she chose  The violet blue that on the mossbank grows  Allsweet to sense the flaunting rose was there  The finish'd chaplet welladorn'd her hair  Great Abbas chanc'd that fated morn to stray  By love conducted from the chace away  Among the vocal vales he heard her song  And sought the vales and echoing groves among  At length he found and woo'd the rural maid  She knew the monarch and with sear obey'd  "Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  "And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  The royal lover bore her from the plain  Yet still her crook and bleating flock remain  Oft as she went she backward turn'd her view  And bad that crook and bleating flock adieu  Fair happy maid to other scenes remove  To richer scenes of golden power and love  Go leave the simple pipe and shepherd's strain  With love delight thee and with Abbas reign  "Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  "And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  Yet midst the blaze of courts she fix'd her love  On the cool fountain or the shady grove  Still with the shepherd's innocence her mind  To the sweet vale and flowery mead inclin'd  And oft as spring renew'd the plains with flowers  Breath'd his soft gales and led the fragrant hours  With sure return she sought the sylvan scene  The breezy mountains and the forests green  Her maids around her mov'd a duteous band  Each bore a crook allrural in her hand  Some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung  With joy the mountain and the forest rung  "Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  "And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  And oft the royal lover left the care  And thorns of state attendant on the fair  Oft to the shades and lowroof 'd cots retir'd  Or sought the vale where first his heart was fir'd  A russet mantle like a swain he wore  And thought of crowns and busy courts no more  "Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  "And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  Blest was the life that royal Abbas led  Sweet was his love and innocent his bed  What if in wealth the noble maid excel  The simple shepherd girl can love as well  Let those who rule on Persia's jewell'd throne  Be fam'd for love and gentlest love alone  Or wreathe like Abbas full of sair renown  The lover's myrtle with the warrior's crown  O happy days the maids around her say  O haste profuse of blessings haste away  "Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  "And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd  ECLOGUE IV  AGIB and SECANDER or the FUGITIVES  SCENE a Mountain in CIRCASSIA  Time Midnight  IN fair Circassia where to love inclin'd  Each swain was blest for every maid was kind  At that still hour when awful midnight reigns  And none but wretches haunt the twilight plains  What time the moon had hung her lamp on high  And past in radiance thro' the cloudless sky  Sad o'er the dews two brother shepherds fled  Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led  Fast as they prest their flight behind them lay  Wide ravag'd plains and vallies stole away  Along the mountain's bending sides they ran  'Till faint and weak Secander thus began  SECANDER  O stay thee Agib for my feet deny  No longer friendly to my life to fly  Friend of my heart O turn thee and survey  Trace our sad flight thro' all its length of way  And first review that long extended plain  And yon wide groves already past with pain  Yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we tried  And last this lofty mountain's weary side  AGIB  Weak as thou art yet hapless must thou know  The toils of flight or some severer woe  Still as I haste the Tartar shouts behind  And shricks and sorrows load the saddening wind  In rage of heart with ruin in his hand  He blasts our harvests and desorms our land  Yon citron grove whence first in fear we came  Droops its fair honours to the conquering flame  Far fly the swains like us in deep despair  And leave to ruffian bands their fleecy care  SECANDER  Unhappy land whose blessings tempt the sword  In vain unheard thou call'st thy Persian lord  In vain thou court'st him helpless to thine aid  To shield the shepherd and protect the maid  Far off in thoughtless indolence resign'd  Soft dreams of love and pleasure soothe his mind  'Midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy  No wars alarm him and no fears annoy  AGIB  Yet these green hills in summer's sultry heat  Have left the monarch oft a cool retreat  Sweet to the sight is Zabran's flowery plain  And once by maids and shepherds lov'd in vain  No more the virgins shall delight to rove  By Sargis banks or Irwan's shady grove  On Tarkie's mountain catch the cooling gale  Or breathe the sweets of Aly's flowery vale  Fair scenes but ah no more with peace possest  With ease alluring and with plenty blest  No more the shepherd's whitening tents appear  Nor the kind products of a bounteous year  No more the date with snowy blossoms crown'd  But ruin spreads her baleful fires around  SECANDER  In vain Circassia boasts her spicy groves  For ever fam'd for pure and happy loves  In vain she boasts her fairest of the fair  Their eye's blue languish and their golden hair  Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief must send  Those hairs the Tartar's cruel hand shall rend  AGIB  Ye Georgian swains that piteous learn from far  Circassia's ruin and the waste of war  Some weightier arms than crooks and staffs prepare  To shield your harvest and defend your fair  The Turk and Tartar like designs pursue  Fix'd to destroy and stedfast to undo  Wild as his land in native deserts bred  By lust incited or by malice led  The villain Arab as he prowls for prey  Oft marks with blood and wasting flames the way  Yet none so cruel as the Tartar foe  To death inur'd and nurst in scenes of woe  He said when loud along the vale was heard  A shriller shriek and nearer fires appear'd  Th' affrighted shepherds thro' the dews of night  Wide o'er the moonlight hills renew'd their flight  ODES DESCRIPTIVE and ALLEGORICAL  ODE TO PITY  O Thou the friend of man assign'd  With balmy hands his wounds to bind  And charm his frantic woe  When first Distress with dagger keen  Broke forth to waste his destin'd scene  His wild unsated foe  By Pella's Bard a magic name  By all the griefs his thought could frame  Receive my humble rite  Long Pity let the nations view  Thy skyworn robes of tenderest blue  And eyes of dewy light  But wherefore need I wander wide  To old Ilissus' distant side  Deserted stream and mute  Wild Arun  A river in Sussex  too has heard thy strains  And Echo 'midst thy native plains  Been sooth'd by Pity's lute  There first the wren thy myrtles shed  On gentlest Otway's infant head  To him thy cell was shewn  And while he sung the female heart  With youth's soft notes unspoil'd by art  Thy turtles mix'd their own  Come Pity come by fancy's aid  Ev'n now my thoughts relenting maid  Thy temple's pride design  Its southern site its truth compleat  Shall raise a wild enthusiast heat  In all who view the shrine  There Picture's toil shall well relate  How chance or hard involving fate  O'er mortal bliss prevail  The buskin'd Muse shall near her stand  And sighing prompt her tender hand  With each disastrous tale  There let me oft retir'd by day  In dreams of passion melt away  Allow'd with thee to dwell  There waste the mournful lamp of night  Till Virgin thou again delight  To hear a British shell  ODE TO FEAR  THOU to whom the world unknown  With all its shadowy shapes is shewn  Who seest appall'd th' unreal scene  While Fancy lifts the veil between  Ah Fear ah frantic Fear  I see I see thee near  I know thy hurried step thy haggard eye  Like thee I start like thee disorder'd fly  For lo what monsters in thy train appear  Danger whose limbs of giant mold  What mortal eye can fix'd behold  Who stalks his round an hideous form  Howling amidst the midnight storm  Or throws him on the ridgy steep  Of some loose hanging rock to sleep  And with him thousand phantoms join'd  Who prompt to deeds accurs'd the mind  And those the fiends who near allied  O'er Nature's wounds and wrecks preside  While Vengeance in the lurid air  Lifts her red arm expos'd and bare  On whom that ravening Brood of fate  Who lap the blood of Sorrow wait  Who Fear this ghastly train can see  And look not madly wild like thee  EPODE  In earliest Greece to thee with partial choice  The grieffull Muse address'd her infant tongue  The maids and matrons on her awful voice  Silent and pale in wild amusement hung  Yet he the Bard  Aeschylus  who first invok'd thy name  Disdain'd in Marathon its power to feel  For not alone he nurs'd the poet's flame  But reach'd from Virtue's hand the patriot's steel  But who is he whom later garlands grace  Who left awhile o'er Hybla's dews to rove  With trembling eyes thy dreary steps to trace  Where thou and Furies shar'd the baleful grove  Wrapt in thy cloudy veil th' incestuous Queen  Jocasta  Sigh'd the sad call her son and husband heard  When once alone it broke the silent scene  And he the wretch of Thebes no more appear'd  O Fear I know thee by thy throbbing heart  Thy withering power inspir'd each mournful line  Tho' gentle Pity claim her mingled part  Yet all the thunders of the scene are thine  ANTISTROPHE  Thou who such weary lengths has past  Where wilt thou rest mad Nymph at last  Say wilt thou shroud in haunted cell  Where gloomy Rape and Murder dwell  Or in some hollow'd seat  'Gainst which the big waves beat  Hear drowning seamens cries in tempests brought  Dark power with shuddering meek submitted thought  Be mine to read the visions old  Which thy awakening bards have told  And lest thou meet my blasted view  Hold each strange tale devoutly true  Ne'er be I found by thee o'eraw'd  In that thrice hallow'd eve abroad  When ghosts as cottagemaids believe  Their pebbled beds permitted leave  And goblins haunt from fire or fen  Or mine or flood the walks of men  O thou whose spirit most possest  The sacred seat of Shakespear's breast  By all that from thy prophet broke  In thy divine emotions spoke  Hither again thy fury deal  Teach me but once like him to feel  His cypress wreath my meed decree  And I O Fear will dwell with thee  ODE TO SIMPLICITY  O THOU by Nature taught  To breathe her genuine thought  In numbers warmly pure and sweetly strong  Who first on mountains wild  In Fancy loveliest child  Thy babe and Pleasure's nurs'd the powers of song  Thou who with hermit heart  Disdain'st the wealth of art  And gauds and pageant weeds and trailing pall  But com'st a decent maid  In Attic robe array'd  O chaste unboastful nymph to thee I call  By all the honney'd store  On Hybla's thymy shore  By all her blooms and mingled murmurs dear  By her whose lovelorn woe  In evening musings slow  Sooth'd sweetly sad Electra's poet's ear  By old Cephisus deep  Who spread his wavy sweep  In warbled wanderings round thy green retreat  On whose enamel'd side  When holy Freedom died  No equal haunt allur'd thy future feet  O sister meek of Truth  To my admiring youth  Thy sober aids and native charms infuse  The flowers that sweetest breathe  Tho' beauty cull'd the wreath  Still ask thy hand to range their order'd hues  While Rome could none esteem  But virtue's patriot theme  You lov'd her hills and led her laureat band  But staid to sing alone  To one distinguish'd throne  And turn'd thy face and fled her alter'd land  No more in hall or bower  The passions own thy power  Love only love her forceless numbers mean  For thou hast left her shrine  Nor olive more nor vine  Shall gain thy feet to bliss the fertile scene  Tho' taste tho' genius bless  To some divine excess  Faints the cold work till thou inspire the whole  What each what all supply  May court may charm our eye  Thou only thou can'st raise the meeting soul  Of these let others ask  To aid some mighty task  I only seek to find thy temperate vale  Where oft my reed might sound  To maids and shepherds round  And all thy sons O Nature learn my tale  ODE ON THE POETICAL CHARACTER  AS once if not with light regard  I read aright that gifted Bard  Him whose school above the rest  His loveliest Elfin queen has blest  One only one unrival'd fair  Florimel See Spenser Leg th    Might hope the magic girdle wear  At solemn turney hung on high  The wish of each lovedarting eye  Lo to each other nymph in turn applied  As if in air unseen some hovering hand  Some chaste and angelfriend to virginfame  With whisper'd spell had burst the starting band  It left unblest her loath'd dishonour'd side  Happier hopeless fair if never  Her baffled hand with vain endeavour  Had touch'd that fatal zone to her denied  Young Fancy thus to me divinest name  To whom prepar'd and bath'd in heaven  The cest of amplest power is given  To few the godlike gift assigns  To gird their blest prophetic loins  And gaze her visions wild and feel unmix'd her flame  The band as fairy legends say  Was wove on that creating day  When he who call'd with thought to birth  Yon tented sky this laughing earth  And drest with springs and forests tall  And pour'd the main engirting all  Long by the lov'd Enthusiast woo'd  Himself in some diviner mood  Retiring sat with her alone  And plac'd her on his saphire throne  The whiles the vaulted shrine around  Seraphic wires were heard to sound  Now sublimest triumph swelling  Now on love and mercy dwelling  And she from out the veiling cloud  Breath'd her magic arts aloud  And thou thou richhair'd youth of morn  And all thy subject lise was born  The dangerous passions kept aloof  Far from the sainted growing woof  But near it sate ecstatic Wonder  Listening the deep applauded thunder  And Truth in sunny vest array'd  By whose the Tarsel's eyes were made  All the shadowy tribes of Mind  In braided dance their murmurs join'd  And all the bright uncounted Pow'rs  Who feed on heaven's ambrosial flowers  Where is the Bard whose soul can now  Its high presuming hopes avow  Where he who thinks with rapture blind  This hallow'd work for him design'd  High on some cliff to heav'n uppil'd  Of rude access of prospect wild  Where tangled round the jealous steep  Strange shades o'erbrow the vallies deep  And holy Genii guard the rock  Its glooms embrown its springs unlock  While on its rich ambitious head  An Eden like its own lies spread  I view that oak the fancied glades among  By which as Milton lay his evening ear  From many a cloud that drop'd ethereal dew  Nigh spher'd in heaven its native strains could hear  On which that antient trump he reach'd was hung  Thither oft his glory greeting  From Waller's myrtle shades retreating  With many a vow srom Hope's aspiring

OBSERVATIONS etc  THE genius of the pastoral as well as of every other respectable species of poetry had its origin in the East and from thence was transplanted by the Muses of Greece but whether from the continent of the lesser Asia or from Egypt which about the aera of the Grecian pastoral was the hospitable nurse of letters it is not easy to determine From the subjects and the manner of Theocritus one would incline to the latter opinion while the history of Bion is in savour of the former  HOWEVER though it should still remain a doubt through what channel the pastoral travelled westward there is not the least shadow of uncertainty concerning its Oriental origin  In those ages which guided by sacred chronology from a comparative view of time we call the early ages it appears from the most authentic historians that the chiess of the people employed themselves in rural exercises and that astronomers and legislators were at the same time shepherds Thus Strabo informs us that the history of the creation was communicated to the Egyptians by a Chaldean shepherd  FROM these circumstances it is evident not only that such shepherds were capable of all the dignity and elegance peculiar to poetry but that whatever poetry they attempted would be of the pastoral kind would take its subjects from those scenes of rural simplicity in which they were conversant and as it was the offspring of Harmony and Nature would employ the powers it derived from the former to celebrate the beauty and benevolence of the latter  ACCORDINGLY we find that the most ancient poems treat of agriculture astronomy and other objects within the rural and natural systems  WHAT constitutes the difference between the Georgic and the Pastoral is love and the colloquial or dramatic form of composition peculiar to the latter this form of composition is sometimes dispensed with and love and rural imagery alone are thought sufficient to distinguish the pastoral The tender passion however seems to be essential to this species of poetry and is hardly ever excluded from those pieces that were intended to come under this denomination even in those eclogues of the Amoebean kind whose only purport is a trial of skill between contending shepherds love has its usual share and the praises of their respective mistesses are the general subjects of the competitors  IT is to be lamented that scarce any oriental compositions of this kind have survived the ravages of ignorance  tyranny and time we cannot doubt that many such have been extant possibly as far down as that fatal period never to be mentioned in the world of letters without horrour when the glorious monuments of human ingenuity perished in the ashes of the Alexandrian library  THOSE ingenious Creeks whom we call the parents of pastoral poetry were probably no more than imitators of imitators that derived their harmony from higher and remoter sources and kindled their poetical fires at those unextinguished lamps which burned within the tombs of oriental genius  IT is evident that Homer has availed himself of those magnificent images and descriptions so frequently to be met with in the books of the Old Testament and why may not Theocritus Moschus and Bion have found their archetypes in other eastern writers whose names have perished with their works yet though it may not be illiberal to admit such a supposition it would certainly be invidious to conclued what the malignity of cavillers alone could suggest with regard to Homer that they destroyed the sources from which they borrowed and as it is fabled of the young of the pelican drained their supporters to death  As the septuaginttranslation of the Old Testament was performed at the request and under the patronage  of Ptolemy Philadelphus it were not to be wondered if Theocritus who was entertained at that prince's court had borrowed some part of his pastoral imagery from the poetical passages of those booksI think it can hardly be doubted that the Sicilian poet had in his eye certain expressions of the prophet Isaiah when he wrote the following lines      Let vexing brambles the blue violet bear  On the rude thorn Narcissus dress his hair  All all revers'dThe pine with pears be crown'd  And the bold deer shall drag the trembling hound  The cause indeed of these phenomena is very different in the Greek from what it is in the Hebrew poet the former employing them on the death the latter on the birth of an important person but the marks of imitation are nevertheless obvious  IT might however be expected that if Theocritus had borrowed at all from the sacred writers the celebrated pastoral Epithalamium of Solomon so much within his own walk of Poetry would not certainly have escaped his notice His Epithalamium on the marriage of Helena moreover gave him an open  field for imitation therefore if he has any obligations to the royal bard we may expect to find them there The very opening of the poem is in the spirit of the Hebrew song    The colour of imitation is still stronger in the following passage          This description of Helen is infinitely above the style and figure of the Sicilian pastoral"She is like the rising of the golden morning when the night departeth and when the winter is over and gone She resembleth the cypress in the garden the horse in the chariots of Thessaly" These figures plainly declare their origin and others equally imitative might be pointed out in the same idyllium  THIS beautiful and luxuriant marriagepastoral of Solomon is the only perfect form of the oriental eclogue that has survived the ruins of time a happiness for which it is probably more indebted to its sacred  character than to its intrinsic merit Not that it is by any means destitute of poetical excellence like all the eastern poetry it is bold wild and unconnected in its figures allusions and parts and has all that graceful and magnificent daring which characterises its metaphorical and comparative imagery  IN consequence of these peculiarities so ill adapted to the frigid genius of the north Mr COLLINS could make but little use of it as a precedent for his oriental eclogues and even in his third eclogue where the subject is of a similar nature he has chosen rather to follow the mode of the Doric and the Latian pastoral  THE scenery and subjects then of the following eclogues alone are Oriental the style and colouring are purely European and for this reason the author's preface in which he intimates that he had the originals from a merchant who traded to the East is omitted as being now altogether superfluous  WITH regard to the merit of these eclogues it may justly be asserted that in simplicity of description and expression in delicacy and softness of numbers and in natural and unaffected tenderness they are not to be equalled by any thing of the pastoral kind in the English language  ECLOGUE I  THIS eclogue which is entitled Selim or the Shepherd's Moral as there is nothing dramatic in the subject may be thought the least entertaining of the four but it is by no means the least valuable The moral precepts which the intelligent shepherd delivers to his fellowswains and virgins their companions are such as would infallibly promote the happiness of the pastoral life  IN impersonating the private  virtues  the poet has observed great propriety and has formed their genealogy with the most perfect judgment when he represents them as the daughters of  truth  and  wisdom  THE characteristics of  Modesty  and  Chastity  are extremely happy and  peinturesque  Come thou  whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear  To lead the train sweet  Modesty  appear  With thee be  Chastity  of all afraid  Distrusting all a wise suspicious maid  Cold is her breast  like flowers that drink the dew  A silken veil conceals her from the view  The two  similes  borrowed from rural objects are not only much in character but perfectly natural and expressive There is notwithstanding this defect in the former that it wants a peculiar propriety for purity of thought may as well be applied to  chastity  as to  modesty  and from this instance as well as from a thousand more we may see the necessity of distinguishing in characteristic poetry every object by marks and attributes peculiarly its own  IT cannot be objected to this eclogue that it wants both these essential  criteria  of the pastoral love and the drama for though it partakes not of the latter the former still retains an interest in it and that too very material as it professedly consults the virtue and happiness of the lover while it informs what are the qualities that must lead to love  ECLOGUE II  ALL the advantages that any species of poetry can derive from the novelty of the subject and scenery this eclogue possesses The rout of a cameldriver is a scene that scarce could exist in the imagination of an European and of its attendant distresses he could have no ideaThese are very happily and minutely painted by our descriptive poet What sublime simpliciry of expression what nervous plainness in the opening of the poem  In silent horror o'er the boundless waste  The driver Hassan with the camels past  The magic pencil of the poet brings the whole scene before us at once as it were by enchantment and in this single couplet we feel all the effect that arises from the terrible wildness of a region unenlivened by the habitations of men The verses that describe so minutely the cameldriver's little provisions have a touching influence on the imagination and prepare to enter more feelingly into his future apprehensions of distress  Bethink thee Hassan where shall thirst assuage  When fails this cruise his unrelenting rage  It is difficult to say whether his apostrophe to the "mute companions of his toils" is more to be admired for the elegance and beauty of the poetical imagery or for the tenderness and humanity of the sentiment He who can read it without being affected will do his heart no injustice if he concludes it to be destitute of sensibility  Ye mute companions of my toils that bear  In all my griess a more than equal share  Here where no springs in murmur break away  Or mosscrown'd fountains mitigate the day  In vain ye hope the green delights to know  Which plains more blest or verdant vales bestow  Here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found  And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around  Yet in these beautiful lines there is a flight error which writers of the greatest genius very frequently fall intoIt will be needless to observe to the accurate reader that in the fifth and sixth verses there is a verbal pleonasm where the poet speaks of the  green  delights of  verdant  vales There is an oversight of  the same kind in the Manners an Ode where the poet says  Seine's  blue  nymphs deplore  In  watchet  weeds  This fault is indeed a common one but to a reader of taste it is nevertheless disgustful and it is mentioned here as the error of a man of genius and judgment that men of genius and judgment may guard against it  MR COLLINS speaks like a true Poet as well in sentiment as expression when with regard to the thirst of wealth he says  Why heed we not while mad we haste along  The gentle voice of peace or pleasure's song  Or wherefor think die flowery mountain's side  The fountain's murmurs and the valley's pride  Why think we these less pleasing to behold  Than dreary deserts if they lead to gold  But however just these sentiments may appear to thofse who have not revolted from nature and simplicity had the author proclaimed them in Lombardstreet or Cheapside he would not have been complimented with the understanding of the bellmanA striking proof  that our own particular ideas of happiness regulate our opinions concerning the sense and wisdom of others  It is impossible to take leave of this most beautiful eclogue without paying the tribute of admiration so justly due to the following nervous lines  What if the lion in his rage I meet  Oft in the dust I view his printed feet  And fearful oft when day's declining light  Yields her pale empire to thc mourner night  By hunger rous'd he scours the groaning plain  Gaunt wolves and fullen tygers in his train  Before them death with shrieks directs their way  Fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey  This amongst many other passages to be met with in the writings of Collins shews that his genius was perfectly capable of the grand and magnificent in description notwithstanding what a learned writer has advanced to the contrary Nothing certainly could be more greatly conceived or more adequately expressed than the image in the last couplet  THAT deception sometimes used in rhetoric and poetry which presents us with an object or sentiment contrary to what we expected is here introduced to the greatest advantage  Farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain  Whom Zara's breaking heart implor'd in vain  Yet as thou go'st may every blast arise  Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs  But this perhaps is rather an artificial prettyness than a real or natural beauty  ECLOGUE III  THAT innocence and native simplicity of manners which in the first eclogue was allowed to constitute the happiness of love is here beautifully described in its effects The Sultan of Persia marries a Georgian shepherdess and finds in her embraces that genuine felicity which unperverted nature alone can bestow The most natural and beautiful parts of this eclogue are those where the fair Sultana refers with so much pleasure to her pastoral amusements and those scenes of happy innocence in which she had passed her early years particularly when upon her first departure  Oft as she went she backward turn'd her view  And bad that crook and bleating flock adieu  This picture of amiable simplicity reminds one of that passage where Proserpine when carried off by Pluto regrets the loss of the flowers she had been gathering  Collecti flores tunicis cecidere remissis  Tantaque simplicitas puerilibus adfuit annis  Haec quoque virgineum movit jactura dolorem  ECLOGUE IV  THE beautiful but unfortunate country where the scene of this pathetic eclogue is laid had been recently torn in pieces by the depredations of its savage neighbours when Mr Collins so affectingly described its misfortunes This ingenious man had not only a pencil to pourtray but a heart to feel for the miseries of mankind and it is with the utmost tenderness and humanity he enters into the narrative of Circassia's ruin while he realizes the scene and brings the present drama before us Of every circumstance that could possibly contribute to the tender effect this pastoral was designed to produce the poet has availed himself with the utmost art and address Thus he prepares the heart to pity the distresses of Circassia by representing it as the scene of the happiest love  In fair Circassia where to love inclin'd  Each swain was blest for every maid was kind  To give the circumstances of the dialogue a more affecting solemnity he makes the time midnight and  describes the two shepherds in the very act of flight from the destruction that swept over their country  Sad o'er the dews two brother shepherds fled  Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led  There is a beauty and propriety in the epithet  wildering  which strikes us more forcibly the more we consider it  THE opening of the dialogue is equally happy natural and unaffected when one of the shepherds weary and overcome with the flight calls upon his companion to review the length of way they had passedThis is certainly painting from nature and the thoughts however obvious or destitute of refinement are perfectly in character But as the closest pursuit of nature is the surest way to excellence in general and to sublimity in particular in poetical description so we find that this simple suggestion of the shepherd is not unattended with magnificence There is grandeur and variety in the landskip he describes  And first review that long extended plain  And yon wide groves already past with pain  Yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we tried  And last this lofty mountain's weary side  There is in imitative harmony an act of expressing a slow and difficult movement by adding to the usual number of pauses in a verse This is observable in the line that describes the ascent of the mountain  And last ‚Äñ this losty mountain's ‚Äñ weary side ‚Äñ  Here we find the number of pauses or musical bars which in an heroic verse is commonly two increased to three  THE liquid melody and the numerous sweetness of expression in the following descriptive lines is almost inimitably beautiful  Sweet to the fight is Zabran's flowery plain  And once by nymphs and shepherds lov'd in vain  No more the virgins shall delight to rove  By Sargis' banks or Irwan's shaddy grove  On Tarkie's mountain catch the cooling gale  Or breathe the sweets of Aly's flowery vale  Nevertheless in this delightful landskip there is an obvious sault there is no distinction between the plain of Zabran and the vale of Aly they are both  flowery  and consequently undiversisied This could not proceed from the poet's want of judgment but from inattention it had not occurred to him that he had  employed the epithet  flowery  twice within so short a compass an oversight which those who are accustomed to poetical or indeed to any other species of composition know to be very possible  NOTHING can be more beautifully conceived or more pathetically expressed than the shepherd's apprehensions for his fair countrywomen exposed to the ravages of the invaders  In vain Circassia boasts her spicy groves  For ever fam'd for pure and happy loves  In vain she boasts her fairest of the fair  Their eye's blue languish and their golden hair  Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief shall send  Those hairs the Tartar's cruel hand shall rend  There is certainly some very powerful charm in the liquid melody of sounds The editor of these poems could never read or hear the following verse repeated without a degree of pleasure otherwise entirely unaccountable  Their eye's  blue languish  and their  golden hair  Such are the Oriental Eclogues which we leave with the same kind of anxious pleasure we feel upon a temporary parting with a beloved friend  OBSERVATIONS ON THE ODES DESCRIPTIVE and ALLEGORICAL  OBSERVATIONS etc  THE genius of COLLINS was capable of every degree of excellence in lyric poetry and perfectly qualified for that high province of the muse Possessed of a native ear for all the varieties of harmony and modulation susceptible of the finest feelings of tenderness and humanity but above all carried away by that high enthusiasm which gives to imagination its strongest colouring he was at once capable of soothing the ear with the melody of his numbers of influencing the passions by the force of his  pathos  and of gratifying the fancy by the luxury of description  IN consequence of these powers but more particularly in consideration of the last he chose such subjects for his lyric essays as were most favourable for the indulgence of description and allegory where he could exercise his powers in moral and personal painting where he could exert his invention in conferring new attributes on images or objects already known and described by a determinate number of characteristics where he might give an uncommon eclat to his figures by placing them in higher attitudes  or in more advantageous lights and introduce new forms from the moral and intellectual world into the society of inpersonated beings  SUCH no doubt were the advantages he derived from the descriptive and allegorical nature of his themes  IT seems to have been the whole industry of our author and it is at the same time almost all the claim to moral excellence his writings can boast to promote the influence of the social virtues by painting them in the fairest and happiest lights  Melior fieri tuendo  would be no improper motto to his poems in general but of his lyric poems it seems to be the whole moral tendency and effect If therefor it should appear to some readers that he has been more industrious to cultivate description than sentiment it may be observed that his descriptions themselves are sentimental and answer the whole end of that species of writing by embellishing every feature of virtue and by conveying through the effects of the pencil the finest moral lessons to the mind  HORACE speaks of the fidelity of the ear in preserence to the uncertainty of the eye but if the mind receives conviction it is certainly of very little importance  through what medium or by which of the senses it is conveyed The impressions left on the imagination may possibly be thought less durable than the deposits of the memory but it may very well admit of a question whether a conclusion of reason or an impression of imagination will soonest make its way to the heart A moral precept conveyed in words is only an account of truth in its effects a moral picture is truth exemplified and which is most likely to gain on the affections it may not be difficult to determine  THIS however must be allowed that those works approach the nearest to perfection which unite these powers and advantages which at once influence the imagination and engage the memory the former by the force of animated and striking description the latter by a brief but harmonious conveyance of precept thus while the heart is influenced through the operation of the passions or the fancy the effect which might otherwise have been transient is secured by the cooperating power of the memory which treasures up in a short aphorism the moral of the scene  THIS is a good reason and this perhaps is the only reason that can be given why our dramatic performances should generally end with a chain of couplets In these the moral of the whole piece is usually  conveyed and that assistance which the memory borrows from rhyme as it was probably the original cause of it gives its usefulness and propriety even there  AFTER these apologies for the  descriptive  turn of the following odes something remains to be said on the origin and use of  allegory  in poetical composition  BY this we are not to understand the trope in the schools which is defined  aliud verbis aliud sensu ostendere  and of which Quintilian says  Usus est ut tristia dicamus melioribus verbis out bonae rei gratia quaedam contrariis significemus  etc It is not the verbal but the sentimental allegory not allegorical expression which indeed might come under the term of  metaphor  but allegorical imagery that is here in question  WHEN we endeavour to trace this species of figurative sentiment to its origin we find it coeval with literature itself It is generally agreed that the most ancient productions are poetical and it is certain that the most ancient poems abound with allegorical imagery  IF then it be allowed that the first literary productions were poetical we shall have little or no difficulty in discovering the origin of allegory  At the birth of letters in the transition from hieroglyphical to literal expression it is not to be wondered if the custom of expressing ideas by personal images  which had so long prevailed should still retain its influence on the mind though the use of letters had rendered the practical application of it superfluous Those who had been accustomed to exprefs strength by the image of an elephant swiftness by that of a panther and courage by that of a lion would make no scruple of substituting in letters the symbols for the ideas they had been used to represent  HERE we plainly see the origin of  allegorical expression  that it arose from the  ashes  of hieroglyphics and if to the same cause we should refer that figurative boldness of style and imagery which distinguish the oriental writings we shall perhaps conclude more justly than if we should impute it to the superior grandeur of the eastern genius  FROM the same source with the  verbal  we are to derive the  sentimental  allegory which is nothing more than a continuation of the metaphorical or symbolical expression of the several agents in an action or the different objects in a scene  The latter most peculiarly comes under the denomination of allegorical imagery and in this species of allegory we include the impersonation of passions affections virtues and vices  etc  on account of which principally the following odes were properly termed by their author allegorical  WITH respect to the utility of this figurative writing the same arguments that have been advanced in favour of descriptive poetry will be of weight likewise here It is indeed from impersonation or as it is commonly termed personification that poetical description borrows its chief powers and graces Without the aid of this moral and intellectual painting would be flat and unanimated and even the scenery of material objects would be dull without the introduction of fictitious life  THESE observations will be most effectually illustrated by the sublime and beautiful odes that occasioned them in those it will appear how happily this allegorical painting may be executed by the genuine powers of poetical genius and they will not fail to prove its force and utility by passing through the imagination to the heart  ODE TO PITY  BY Pella's Bard a magic name  By all the griefs his thought could frame  Receive my humble rite  Long Pity let the nations view  Thy skyworn robes of tenderest blue  And eyes of dewy light  The propriety of invoking Pity through the mediation of Euripides is obviousThat admirable poet had the keys of all the tender passions and therefor could not but stand in the highest esleem with a writer of Mr COLLIN'S sensibilityHe didindeed admire him as much as MILTON professedly did and probably for the same reasons but we do not find that he has copied him so closely as the last mentioned poet has sometimes done and particularly in the opening of SamsonAgonistes which is an evident imitation of the following passage in the          The "eyes of dewy light" is one of the happiest strokes of imagination and may be ranked among those expressions which  give us back the image of the mind  Wild ARUN too has heard thy strains  And Echo 'midst thy native plains  Been sooth'd with Pity's lute  There first the wren thy myrtles shed  On gentlest OTWAY'S infant head  Suffex in which country the Arun is a small river had the honour of giving birth to OTWAY as well as to COLLINS Both these poets became the objects of that pity by which their writings are distinguished There was a similitude in their genius and in their sufferings There was a resemblance in the misfortunes and in the dissipation of their lives and the circumstances of their death cannot be remembered without pain  THE thought of painting in the temple of Pity the history of human misfortunes and of drawing the scenes from the tragic muse is very happy and in every respect worthy the imagination of COLLINS  ODE TO FEAR  MR Cwho had often determined to apply himself to dramatic poetry seems here with the same view to have addressed one of the principal powers of the drama and to implore that mighty influence she had given to the genius of Shakespear  Hither again thy fury deal  Teach me but once like him to feel  His cypress wreath my meed decree  And I O Fear will dwell with thee  In the construction of this nervous ode the author has shewn equal power of judgment and imagination Nothing can be more striking than the violent and abrupt abbreviation of the measure in the fifth and sixth verses when he feels the strong influences of the power he invokes  Ah Fear ah frantic Fear  I see I see thee near  The editor of these poems has met with nothing in the same species of poetry either in his own or in  any other language equal in all respects to the following description of Danger  Danger whose limbs of giantmold  What mortal eye can fix'd behold  Who stalks his round and hideous sorm  Howling amidst the midnight storm  Or throws him on the ridgy steep  Of some loose hanging rock to sleep  It is impossible to contemplate the image conveyed in the two last verses without these emotions of terror it was intended to excite It has moreover the entire advantage of novelty to recommend it sor there is too much originality in all the circumstances to suppose that the author had in his eye that description of the penal situation of Cataline in the ninth AEneid  Te Catalina minaci  Pendentem scopulo  The archetype of the English poet's idea was in nature and probably to her alone he was indebted for the thought From her likewise he derived that magnificence of conception that horrible grandeur of imagery displayed in the following lines  And those the fiends who near allied  O'er Nature's wounds and wrecks preside  While Vengeance in the lurid air  Lifts her red arm expos'd and bare  On whom the ravening Brood of fate  Who lap the blood of Sorrow wait  That nutritive enthusiasm which cherishes the seeds of poetry and which is indeed the only soil wherein they will grow to perfection lays open the mind to ail the influences of fiction A passion for whatever is greatly wild or magnificent in the works of nature seduces the imagination to attend to all that is extravagant however unnatural Milton was notoriously fond of high romance and gothic  diableries  and Collins who in genius and enthusiasm bore no very distant resemblance to Milton was wholly carried away by the same attachments  Be mine to read the visions old  Which thy awakening bards have told  And lest thou meet my blasted view  HOLD EACH STRANGE TALE DEVOUTLY TRUE  On that thrice hallow'd eve  etc  There is an old traditionary superstition that on St Mark's eve the forms of all such persons as shall die within the ensuing year make their solemn entry into the churches of their respective parishes as St Patrick swam over the channel without their heads  ODE TO SIMPLICITY  THE measure of the ancient ballad seems to have been made choice of for this ode on account of the subject and it has indeed an air of simplicity not altogether unaffecting  By all the honey'd store  On Hybla's thymy shore  By all her blooms and mingled murmurs dear  By her whose lovelorn woe  In evening musings slow  Sooth'd sweetly sad Electra's poet's ear  This allegorical imagery of the honey'd store the blooms and mingled murmurs of Hybla alluding to the sweetness and beauty of the  attic  poetry has the finest and the happiest effect yet possibly it will bear a question whether the ancient Greek tragedians had a general claim to simplicity in any thing more than the plans of their drama Their language at least was infinitely metaphorical yet it must be owned that they justly copied nature and the passions and so far certainly they were entitled to the palm of true simplicity the following most beautiful speech  of Polynices will be a monument of this so long as poetry shall last          EURIP  But staid to sing alone  To one distinguish'd throne  The poet cuts off the prevalence of Simplicity among the Romans with the reign of Augustus and indeed it did not continue much longer most of the compositions after that date giving into false and artificial ornament  No more in hall or bower  The passions own thy power  Love only love her forceless numbers mean  In these lines the writings of the Provencial poets are principally alluded to in which simplicity is generally sacrificed to the rapsodies of romantic love  ODE On the Poetical Character  Procul O procul este profani  THIS ode is so infinitely abstracted and replete with high enthusiasm that it will find few readers capable of entering into the spirit of it or of relishing its beauties There is a style of sentiment as utterly unintelligible to common capacities as if the subject were treated in an unknown language and it is on the same account that abstratcted poetry will never have many admirers The authors of such poems must be content with the approbation of those heavenfavoured geniuses who by a similiarity of taste and sentiment are enabled to penetrate the high mysterics of inspired fancy and to pursue the loftiest flights of enthusiastic imagination Nevertheless the praise of the distinguished few is certainly preferable to the applause of the undiscerning million for all praise is valuable in proportion to the judgment of those who conser it  As the subject of this ode is uncommon so are the style and expression highly metaphorical and abstracted  thus the sun is called "the richhair'd youth of morn" the ideas are termed "the shadowy tribes of mind"  etc  We are struck with the propriety of this mode of expression here and it assords us new proofs of the analogy that subsists between language and sentiment  NOTHING can be more lostily imagined than the creation of the Cestus of Fancy in this ode the allegorical imagery is rich and sublime and the observation that the dangerous passions kept aloof during the operation is founded on the strictest philosophical truth for poetical fancy can exist only in minds that are perfectly serene and in some measure abstracted from the influences of sense  THE scene of Milton's "inspiring hour" is perfectly in character and described with all those wildwood appearances of which the great poet was so enthusiastically fond  I view that oak the fancied glades among  By which as Milton lay his evening ear  Nigh spher'd in heaven its native strains could hear  ODE Written in the Year MDCCXLVI  ODE TO MERCY  THE ode written in and the ode to Mercy seem to have been written on the same occasion  viz  the late rebellion the sormer in memory of those heroes who fell in defence of their country the latter to excite sentiments of compassion in savour of those unhappy and deluded wretches who became a sacrifice to public justice  THE language and imagery of both are very beautiful but the seene and figures described in the strophe of the ode to Mercy are exquisitely striking and would afford a painter one of the finest subjects in the world  ODE TO LIBERTY  THE ancient states of Greece perhaps the only ones in which a perfect model of liberty ever existed are naturaily brought to view in the opening of the poem  Who shall awake the Spartan sise  And call in solemn sounds to life  The youths whose locks divinely spreading  Like vernal hyacinths in sullen hue  etc  There is something extremely bold in this imagery of the locks of the Spartan youths and greatly superior to that deseription Jocasta gives us of the hair of Polynices    What new Alcaeus facyblest  Shall sing the sword in myrtles drest  etc  This alludes to a fragment of Alcaeus still remaining in which the poet celebrates Harmodius and Aristogiton  who slew the tyrant Hipparchus and thereby restored the liberty of Athens  THE fall of Rome is here most nervously described in one line  With heaviest sound a giantstatue fell  The thought seems altogether new and the imitative harmony in the structure of the verse is admirable  AFTER bewailing the ruin of ancient liberty the poet considers the influence it has retained or still retains among the moderns and here the republics of Italy naturally engage his attentionFlorence indeed only to be lamented on the account of losing its liberty under those patrons of letters the Medicean family the  jealous  Pisa justly so called in respect to its long impatience and regret under the same yoke and the small Marino which however unrespectable with regard to power or extent of territory has at least this distinction to boast that it has preserved its liberty longer than any other state ancient or modern having without any revolution retained its present mode of government near years Moreover the patron saint who founded it and from whom it takes its name deserves this poetical record as he is perhaps the only saint that ever contributed to the establishment of freedom  Nor e'er her former pride relate  To sad Liguria's bleeding slate  In these lines the poet alludes to those ravages in the state of Genoa occasioned by the unhappy divisions of the Guelphs and Gibelines  When the savour'd of thy choice  The daring archer heard thy voice  For an account of the celebrated event referred to in these verses see Voltaire's Epistle to the King of Prussia  Those whom the rod of Alva bruis'd  Whose crown a British queen refus'd  THE Flemings were so dreadfully oppressed by this sanguinary general of Philip the second that they offered their sovereignty to Elizabeth but happily for her subjects she had policy and magnanimity enough to refuse it  Deformeaux  in his  Abr√©ge Chronologique de l' Histoire d'Espagne  thus describes the sufferings of the Flemings "Le Duc d' Albe achevoit de r√©duire les Flamands au d√©sespoir Apr√©s avoir inond√© les echafauts du sang le plus noble et le plus pr√©cieux il fasoit construire des citadelles en divers  endroits et vouloit √©tablir  l' Alcavala  ce tribute on√©reux qui avoit √©t√© longtems en usage parmi les Espagnols"  Abreg Chron Tom IV  Mona  Where thousand Elfin shapes abide  Mona is properly the Roman name of the Isle of Anglesey anciently so famous for its Druids but sometimes as in this place it is given to the Isle of Man Both these isles still retain much of the genius of superstition and are now the only places where there is the least chance of finding a fairy  ODE To a Lady on the Death of Colonel CHARLES ROSS in the Action at Fontenoy  Written MAY MDCCXLV  THE iambic kind of numbers in which this ode is conceived seems as calculated for tender and plaintive subjects as for those where strength or rapidity is requiredThis perhaps is owing to the repetition of the strain in the same stanza for sorrow rejects variety and affects an uniformity of complaint It is needless to observe that this ode is replete with harmony spirit pathos and there surely appears no reason why the seventh and eighth stanzas should be omitted in that copy printed in Dodsley's collection of poems  ODE TO EVENING  THE blank ode has for some time solicited admission into the English poetry but its efforts hitherto seem to have been vain at least its reception has been no more than partial It remains a question then whether there is not something in the nature of blank verse less adapted to the lyric than to the heroic measure since though it has been generally received in the latter it is yet unadopted in the former In order to discover this we are to consider the different modes of these different species of poetry That of the heroic is uniform that of the lyric is various and in these circumstances of uniformity and variety probably lies the cause why blank verse has been successful in the one and unacceptable in the other While it presented itself only in one form it was familiarized to the ear by custom but where it was obliged to assume the different shapes of the lyric muse it seemed still a stranger of uncouth figure was received rather with curiosity than with pleasure and entertained without that ease or satisfaction which acquaintance and familiarity produceMoreover the heroic blank verse obtained a sanction of infinite importance to its general reception when it  was adopted by one of the greatest poets the world ever produced and was made the vehicle of the noblest poem that ever was written When this poem at length extorted that applause which ignorance and prejudice had united to withhold the versification soon found its imitators and became more generally successful than even in those countries from whence it was imported But lyric blank verse has met with no such advantages for Mr Collins whose genius and judgment in harmony might have given it so powerful an effect has left us but one specimen of it in the Ode to Evening  IN the choice of his measure he seems to have had in his eye Horace's ode to Pyrrha for this ode bears the nearest resemblance to that mixt kind of the asclepiad and pherecratic verse and that resemblance in some degree reconciles us to the want of rhyme while it reminds us of those great masters of antiquity whose works had no need of this whimsical jingle of sounds  FROM the following passage one might be induced to think that the poet had it in view to render his subject and his versification suitable to each other on this occasion and that when he addressed himself to the sober power of evening he had thought proper to lay aside the soppery of rhyme  Now teach me Maid compos'd  To breathe some  sosten'd  strain  Whose numbers stealing thro' thy dark'ning vale  May not unseemly with its  stillness  suit  As musing slow I hail  Thy genial lov'd return  But whatever were the numbers or the versification of this ode the imagery and enthusiasm it contains could not fail of rendering it delightful No other of Mr Collins's odes is more generally characteristic of his genius In one place we discover his passion for visionary beings  For when thy solding star arising shews  His paly circlet at his warning lamp  The fragrant Hours and Elves  Who slept in buds the day  And many a nymph who wreaths her brows with fedge  And sheds the freshening dew and lovelier still  The pensive pleasures sweet  Prepare thy shadowy car  In another we behold his strong bias to melancholy  Then let me rove some wild and heathy scene  Or find some ruin 'midst its dreary dells  Whose walls more awful nod  By thy religious gleams  Then appears his taste for what is wildly grand and magnificent in nature when prevented by storms from enjoying his evening walk he wishes for a situation  That from the mountain's side  Views wilds and swelling floods  And through the whole his invariable attachment to the expression of painting  and marks o'er all  Thy dewy fingers draw  The gradual dusky veil  It might be a sufficient encomium on this beautiful ode to observe that it has been particularly admired by a lady to whom Nature has given the most perfect principles of taste She has not even complained of the want of rhyme in it a circumstance by no means unfavourable to the cause of lyric blank verse sor surely if a fair reader can endure an ode without bells and chimes the masculine genius may dispense with them  THE MANNERS AN ODE  FROM the subject and sentiments of this ode it seems not improbable that the author wrote it about the time when he left the University when weary with the pursuit of academical studies he no longer confined himself to the search of theoretical knowlege but commenced the  scholar of humanity  to study nature in her works and man in society  THE following farewell to science exhibits a very just as well as striking picture for however exalted in the theory the Platonic doctrines may appear it is certain that Platonism and Pyrrhonism are nearly allied  Farewell the porch whose roof is seen  Arch'd with th' enlivening olive's green  Where Science prank'd in tissued vest  By Reason Pride and Fancy drest  Comes like a bride so trim array'd  To wed with Doubt in Plato's shade  When the mind goes in pursuit of visionary systems it is not far from the regions of doubt and the greater its capacity to think abstractedly to reason and refine  the more it will be exposed to and bewildered in uncertaintyFrom an enthusiastic warmth of temper indeed we may for a while be encouraged to persist in some adopted system but when that enhusiasm which is founded on the vivacity of the passions gradually cools and dies away with them the opinions it supported drop from us and we are thrown upon the inhospitable shore of doubtA striking proof of the necessity of some moral rule of wisdom and virtue and some system of happiness established by unerring knowlege and unlimited power  IN the poet's address to Humour in this ode there is one image of singular beauty and propriety The ornaments in the hair of  wit  are of such a nature and disposed in such a manner as to be perfectly symbolical and characteristic  Me too amidst thy band admit  There where the youngey'd healthful Wit  Whose jewels in his crisped hair  Are plac'd each other's beams to share  Whom no delights from thee divide  In laughter loos'd attends thy side  Nothing could be more expressive of wit which consists in a happy collision of comparative and relative  images than this reciprocal reflection of light from the disposition of the jewels  O Humour thou whose name is known  To Briton's favour'd isle alone  The author could only mean to apply this to the time when he wrote since other nations had produced works of great humour as he himself acknowleges afterwards  By old Miletus  etc  By all you taught the Tuscan maids  etc  The Milesian and Tuscan romances were by no means distinguished for humour but as they were the models of that species of writing in which humour was afterwards employed they are probably for that reason only mentioned here  THE PASSIONS  An Ode for Music  IF the music which was composed for this ode had equal merit with the ode itself it must have been the most excellent performance of the kind in which poetry and music have in modern times united Other pieces of the same nature have derived their greatest reputation from the perfection of the music that accompanied them having in themselves little more merit than that of an ordinary ballad but in this we have the whole soul and power of poetryExpression that even without the aid of music strikes to the heart and imagery of power enough to transport the attention without the forceful alliance of corresponding sounds what then must have been the effect of these united  IT is very observable that though the measure is the same in which the musical efforts of fear anger and despair are described yet by the variation of the cadence the character and operation of each is strongly expressed thus particularly of despair  With woeful measures wan Despair  Low sullen sounds his grief beguil'd  A solemn strange and mingled air  'Twas sad by fits by starts 'twas wild  He must be a very unskilful composer who could not catch the power of imitative harmony from these lines  THE picture of Hope that follows this is beautiful almost beyond imitation By the united powers of imagery and harmony that delightful Being is exhibited with all the charms and graces that pleasure and fancy have appropriated to her  Relegat qui semel percurrit  Qui nunquam legit legat  But thou O Hope with eyes so fair  What was thy delighted measure  Still it whisper'd promis'd pleasure  And bad the lovely seenes at distance hail  Still would her touch the strain prolong  And from the rocks the woods the vale  She call'd on Echo still thro' all the song  And where her sweetest theme she chose  A soft responsive voice was heard at every close  And Hope enchanted smil'd and wav'd her golden hair  In what an exalted light does the above stanza place this great master of imagery and harmony what varied sweetness of numbers what delicacy of judgment and expression how characteristically does Hope prolong her strain repeat her soothing closes call upon her associate Echo for the same purposes and display every pleasing grace peculiar to her  And Hope enchanted smil'd and wav'd her golden hair  Legat qui nunquam legit  Qui semel percurrit relegat  The descriptions of joy jealousy and revenge are excellent though not equally so those of melancholy and chearfulness are superior to every thing of the kind and upon the whole there may be very little hazard in asserting that this is the finest ode in the English language  AN EPISTLE  Addressed to Sir THOMAS HANMER on his Edition of SHAKESPEAR'S Works  THIS poem was written by our author at the university about the time when Sir Thomas Hanmer's pompous edition of Shakespear was printed at Oxford If it has not so much merit as the rest of his poems it has still more than the subject deserves The versification is easy and genteel and the allusions always poetical The character of the poet Fletcher in particular is very justly drawn in this epistle  DIRGE In CYMBELINE  ODE ON THE DEATH OF MR THOMSON  MR COLLINS had  skill to complain  Of that mournful melody and those tender images which are the distinguishing excellencies of such pieces as bewail departed friendship or beanty he was  an almost unequalled master He knew perfectly to exhibite such circumstances peculiar to the objects as awaken the influences of pity and while from his own great sensibility he felt what he wrote he naturally addressed himself to the feelings of others  To read such lines as the following all beautiful and tender as they are without corresponding emotions of pity is surely impossible  The tender thought on thee shall dwell  Each lonely scene shall thee restore  For thee the tear be duly shed  Belov'd 'till life can charm no more  And mourn'd 'till Pity's self be dead  The ode on the death of Thomson seems to have been written in an excursion to Richmond by water The rural scenery has a proper effect in an ode to the memory of a poet much of whose merit lay in descriptions of the same kind and the appellations of "Druid" and "meek nature's child" are happily characteristic For the better understanding of this ode it is necessary to remember that Mr Thomson lies buried in the church of Richmond  THE END
