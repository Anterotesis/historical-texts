 LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE ADDRESSERS ON THE LATE  PROCLAMATION  BY THOMAS PAINE SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO CONGRESS IN THE AMERICAN WAR AND AUTHOR OF THE WORKS INTITLED  "COMMON SENSE" "RIGHTS OF MAN  TWO PARTS" c  LONDON PRINTED FOR H D SYMONDS IN PATERNOSTERROW AND THOMAS CLIO RICKMAN NO UPPER MARYLEBONESTREET    Entered at Stationers Hall  PRICE ONE SHILLING AND SIXPENCE  LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE ADDRESSERS ON THE LATE  PROCLAMATION  COULD I have commanded circumstances with a wish I know not of any that would have more generally promoted the progress of knowledge than the late Proclamation and the numerous rotten Borough and Corporation Ad∣dresses thereon They have not only served as advertisements but they have excited a spirit of enquiry into principles of government and a de∣sire to read the RIGHTS OF MAN in places where that spirit and that work were before un∣known  The people of England wearied and stunned with parties and alternately deceived by each had almost resigned the prerogative of thinking Even curiosity had expired and a universal langour had spread itself over the land The opposition  was visibly no other that a contest for power whilst the mass of the nation stood torpidly by as the prize  In this hopeless state of things the First Part of RIGHT OF MAN made its appearance It had to combat with a strange mixture of prejudice and indifference it stood exposed to every species of newspaper abuse and besides this it had to remove the obstructions which Mr Burke's rude and out∣rageous attack on the French Revolution had art∣fully raised  But how easily does even the most illiterate reader distinguish the spontaneous sensations of the heart from the laboured productions of the brain Truth whenever it can fully appear is a thing so naturally familiar to the mind that an acquaintance commences at first sight No ar∣tificial light yet discovered can display all the properties of daylight so neither can the best invented fiction fill the mind with every con∣viction which truth begets  To overthrow Mr Burke's fallacious work was scarcely the operation of a day Even the pha∣lanx of Placemen and Pensioners who had given the tone to the multitude by clamouring forth his political fame became suddenly silent and the final event to himself has been that as he rose like a rocket he fell like the stick  It seldom happens that the mind rests satisfied with the simple detection of error or imposition Once put into motion  that  motion soon becomes  accelerated where it had intended to stop it discovers new reasons to proceed and renews and continues the pursuit far beyond the limits it first prescribed to itselfThus it has happened to the people of England From a detection of Mr Burke's incoherent rhapsodies and distorted facts they began an enquiry into first principles of Go∣vernment whilst himself like an object left far behind became invisible and forgotten  Much as the First Part of RIGHTS OF MAN impressed at its first appearance the progressive mind soon discovered that it did not go far enough It detected errors it exposed absurdities it shook the fabric of political superstition it generated new ideas but it did not produce a regular system of principles in the room of those which it dis∣placed And if I may guess at the mind of the Governmentparty they beheld it as an unexpected gale that would soon blow over and they forbore like sailors in threatening weather to whistle lest they should encrease the wind Every thing on their part was profound silence  When the Second Part of  RIGHTS OF MAN  combining Principle and Practice  was prepar∣ing to appear they affected for a while to act with the same policy as before but finding their silence had no more influence in stilling the pro∣gress of the work than it would have in stopping the progress of time they changed their plan and affected to treat it with clamorous contempt The Speechmaking Placemen and Pensioners  and Placeexpectants in both Houses of Parlia∣ment the  Outs  as well as the  Ins  represented it as a silly insignificant performance as a work in∣capable of producing any effect as something which they were sure the good sense of the people would either despise or indignantly spurn but such was the overstrained awkwardness with which they harangued and encouraged each other that in the very act of declaring their confidence they betrayed their fears  As most of the rotten Borough Addressers are obscured in holes and corners throughout the country and to whom a newspaper arrives as rarely as an almanac they most probably have not had the opportunity of knowing how this part of the farce the original prelude to all the Addresses has been acted For  their  information I will suspend a while the more serious purpose of my Letter and entertain them with two or three Speeches in the last Session of Parliament which will serve them for politics till Parliament meets again  You must know Gentlemen that the Second Part of RIGHTS OF MAN the book against which you have been presenting Addresses though it is most probable that many of you did not know it was to have come out precisely at the time that Par∣liament last met It happened not to be published till a few days after But as it was very well known that the book would shortly appear the parliamen∣tary Orators entered into a very cordial coalition to  cry the book down and they began their attack by crying up the  blessings  of the Constitution  Had it been your fate to have been there you could not but have been moved at the heartandpocketsfelt congratulations that passed between all the parties on this subject of  blessings  for the  Outs  enjoy places and pensions and sinecures as well as the  Ins  and are as devoutly attached to the firm of the house  One of the most conspicuous of this motley groupe is the Clerk of the Court of King's Bench who calls himself Lord Stormont He is also called Justice General of Scotland and Keeper of Scoon an opposition man and he draws from the public for these nominal offices not less as I am informed than six thousand pounds a year and he is most probably at the trouble of count∣ing the money and signing a receipt to shew per∣haps that he is qualified to be Clerk as well as Justice He spoke as follows  See his Speech in the Morning Chronicle of Feb  THAT  we  shall  all  be unanimous in ex∣pressing  our  attachment to the constitution of these realms  I am confident  It is a subject upon which there can be  no  divided opinion in  this house  I do not pretend to be deep read in the knowledge of the Constitution but  I take upon me  to say that from the extent of  my  knowledge  for I have so many thousands a year for nothing  it appears to  me  that from the period of the Revolution for it was  by no means created then it has been both in  theory  and  practice  the  wisest  system that ever was formed I never was he means he never was  till now  a dealer in  political cant  My life has not been occupied in  that way  but the specu∣lations of late years  seem to have taken a turn for which I cannot account  When I came into public life the political pamphlets of the time however they might be charged with the heat and violence of parties were agreed in ex∣tolling the radical beauties of the Constitution itself I remember  he means he has for∣gotton  a most captivating eulogium on its  charms  by Lord Bolingbroke where he re∣commends his readers to contemplate it in all its aspects with the assurance that it would be found more estimable the more it was  seen  I do  not recollect  his precise words but I wish that men who write upon these sub∣jects would take  this for their model  instead of the political pamphlets which I am told are now in circulation such I suppose as  Rights of Man  pamphlets which I have  not read  and whose purport I know only by  report  he means perhaps by the  noise  they make This however I am sure that pamphlets tending to unsettle the public reverence for the  constitution  will have very little influence They can do very little harm for  by the bye he is no dealer in political cant the English are a soberthinking people and are more intelligent more solid more steady in their  opinions than any people I ever had the fortune to see  This is pretty well laid on though for a new beginner But if there should ever come a time when the propagation of those doctrines should agitate the public mind I am  sure  for  every one  of your Lordships that no attack will be made on the constitution from which it is  truly said  that  we  derive  all our  prosperity with∣out raising  every one  of your Lordships to its support It will then be found that there is no difference among  us  but that  we  are  all  deter∣mined to  stand  or  fall  together in defence of the inestimable system  of places and pensions  After Stormont on the opposition side sat down up rose  another noble Lord  on the ministe∣rial side  Grenville  This man ought to be as strong in the back as a mule or the  sire  of a mule or it would crack with the weight of places and offices He rose however without feeling any in∣cumbrance full master of his weight and thus said  this  noble Lord to  t'other  noble Lord  The  patriotic  and  manly  manner in which the noble Lord has declared  his  sentiments on the subject of the constitution demands  my cordial  approbation The noble Viscount has  proved  that however we may differ on  par∣ticular measures  amidst all the jars and dis∣sonance of  parties  we are unanimous in  princi∣ple  There is a  perfect  and  entire consent  be∣tween  us  in the love and maintenance of the constitution as  happily subsisting  It must  un∣doubtedly  give your Lordships  concern  to find that the  time is come  heigh ho when there is  propriety  in these expressions of regard TO O O O THE CONSTITUTION And that there are men confoundtheirpolitics who dis∣seminate doctrines  hostile  to the  genuine spirit  of our  well balanced system  it is certainly well balanced when both sides hold places and pensions at once I agree with the noble Vis∣count that they have not I hope  much success  I am convinced that there is no danger to be apprehended from their attempts but it is  truly  important and  consolatary  to us placemen I sup∣pose to know that if there should ever arise a serious alarm there is but one  spirit one sense  and that sense I presume is not  common sense  and  one  determination in  this  house  which un∣doubtedly is to hold all their places and pensions as long as they can  Both those speeches excepting the parts en∣closed in parentheses which are added for the pur∣pose of  illustration  are copied  verbatim  from the Morning Chronicle of the st of February last and when the situation of the speakers is consider∣ed the one in the opposition and the other in the ministry and both of them living at the public ex∣pence by sinecure or nominal places and offices it required a very unblushing front to be able to deliver them Can those men seriously suppose any nation to be so completely blind as not to see through them Can Stormont imagine that the  political cant  with which he has larded his ha∣rangue will conceal the craft Does he not know that there never was a cover large enough to hide  itself  Or can Grenville believe that his credit with the public encreases with his avarice for places  But if these orators will accept a service from me in return for the allusions they have made to the  Rights of Man  I will make a speech for either of them to deliver on the excellence of the consti∣tution that shall be as much to the purpose as what they have spoken or as  Bolingbroke's capti∣vating encomium  Here it is  THAT we shall all be unanimous in expressing our attachment to the constitution I am confi∣dent It is my Lords incomprehensibly good but the great wonder of all is the wisdom for it is my Lords  the wisest system that ever was formed  With respect to us noble Lords though the world does not know it it is very well known to us that we have more wisdom than we know what to do with and what is still better my Lords we have it all in stock I defy your Lordships to prove that a tittle of it has been used yet and if we do but go on my Lords with the frugality we have hitherto done we shall leave to our heirs and successors when we go out of the world the whole stock of wisdom  untouched  that we brought in and there is no doubt but they will follow our example This my Lords is one of the blessed effects of the hereditary system for we can never  be without wisdom so long as we keep it by us and do not use it  But my Lords as all this wisdom is heredi∣tary property for the sole benefit of us and our heirs and as it is necessary that the people should know where to get a supply for their own use the excellence of our constitution has provided a King for this very purpose and for  no other  But my Lords I perceive a defect to which the consti∣tution is subject and which I propose to remedy by bringing a bill into Parliament for that purpose  The constitution my Lords out of delicacy I presume has left it as a matter of  choice  to a King whether he will be wise or not It has not I mean my Lords insisted upon it as a constitu∣tional point which I conceive it ought to have done for I pledge myself to your Lordships to prove and that with  true patriotic boldness  that he has  no choice in the matter  The bill my Lords that I shall bring in will be to declare that the constitution according to the true intent and mean∣ing thereof does not invest the King with this choice our ancestors were too wise to do that and in order to prevent any doubts that might otherwise arise I shall prepare my Lords an enact∣ing clause to fix the wisdom of Kings by act of Parliament and then my Lords our Constitution will be the wonder of the world  Wisdom my Lords is the one thing needful but that there may be no mistake in this matter  and that we may proceed consistently with the true wisdom of the constitution I shall propose a  certain criterion  whereby the  exact quantity of wisdom  ne∣cessary for a King may be known Here should be a cry of Hear him Hear him  It is recorded my Lords in the Statutes at Large of the Jews  a book my Lords which I have not read and whose purport I know only by report  but perhaps the bench of Bishops can recollect something about it  that Saul gave the most convincing proofs of royal wisdom before he was made a King  for he was sent to seek his father's asses and he could not find them  Here my Lords we have most happily for us a case in point This precedent ought to be established by act of Parliament and every King before he be crowned should be sent to seek his father's asses and if he cannot find them he shall be declared wise enough to be King according to the true meaning of our excellent constitution All therefore my Lords that will be necessary to be done by the enacting clause that I shall bring in will be to invest the King beforehand with the quantity of wisdom necessary for this purpose lest he should happen not to possess it and this my Lords we can do without making use of any of our own  We further read my Lords in the said Statutes at Large of the Jews that Samuel who certainly was as mad as any ManofRightsMan now adays  hear him hear him was highly displeased and even exasperated at the proposal of the Jews to have a King and he warned them against it with all that assurance and impudence of which he was master I have been my Lords at the trouble of going all the way to  Paternosterrow  to procure an extract from the printed copy I was told that I should meet with it there or in  Amencorner  for I was then going my Lords to rummage for it among the curiosities of the  Antiquarian Society  I will read the extract to your Lordships to shew how little Samuel knew of the matter  The extract my Lords is from  Samuel  chap  And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a King  And he said this will be the manner of the King that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots  And he will appoint him captains over thou∣sands and captains over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots  And he will take your daughters to be confec∣tionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers  And he will take your fields and your vine∣yards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants  And he will take tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants  And he will take your menservants and your maidservants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work  And he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servants  And ye shall cry out in that day because of your King which ye shall have chosen you and the Lord will not hear you on that day  Now my Lords what can we think of this man Samuel Is there a word of truth or any thing like truth in all that he has said He pre∣tended to be a prophet or a wise man but has not the event proved him to be a fool or an incen∣diary Look around my Lords and see if any thing has happened that he pretended to foretell Has not the most profound peace reigned through∣out the world ever since Kings were in fashion Are not for example the present Kings of Europe the most peaceable of mankind and the Empress of Russia the very milk of human kindness It would not be worth having Kings my Lords if it were not that they never go to war  If we look at home my Lords do we not see the same things here as are seen every where else Are our young men taken to be horsemen or foot soldiers any more than in Germany or in Prussia or in Hanover or in Hesse Are not our sailors as safe at land as at sea Are they ever dragged from  their homes like oxen to the slaughterhouse to serve on board ships of war When they return from the perils of long voyage with the merchan∣dize of distant countries does not every man sit down under his own vine and his own figtree in perfect security Is the tenth of our seed taken by taxgatherers or is any part of it given to the King's servants In short  is not every thing as free from taxes as the light from Heaven  Ah my Lords do we not see the blessed effect of having Kings in every thing we look at Is not the G R or the broad R stampt upon every thing Even the shoes the gloves and the hats that we wear are enriched with the impression and all our candles blaze a burntoffering  Besides these blessings my Lords that cover us from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head do we not see a race of youths growing up to be Kings who are the very paragons of virtue There is not one of them my Lords but might be trusted with untold gold as safely as the other Are they not  more sober more intelligent more so∣lid more steady  and withall more learned more wise more every thing than any youths  we  ever had the fortune to see  Ah my Lords they are a  hopeful family  The blessed prospect of succession which the nation has at this moment before its eyes is a most undeniable proof of the excellence of our constitution and of the blessed hereditary system for nothing my Lords but a constitution founded  on the truest and purest wisdom could admit such heavenborn and heaventaught characters into the governmentPermit me now my Lords to recal your attention to the libellous chapter I have just read about Kings I mention this my Lords be∣cause it is my intention to move for a bill to be brought into Parliament to expunge that chapter from the Bible and that the Lord Chancellor with the assistance of the Prince of Wales the Duke of York and the Duke of Clarence be requested to write a chapter in the room of it and that Mr Burke do see that it be truly canonical and faith∣fully inserted'FINIS  If the Clerk of the Court of King's Bench should chuse to be the orator of this luminous en∣comium on the constitution I hope he will get it well by heart before he attempt to deliver it and not to have to apologize to Parliament as he did in the case of Bolingbroke's encomium for for∣getting his lesson and with this admonition I leave him  Having thus informed the Addressers of what passed at the meeting of Parliament I return to take up the subject at the part where I broke off in order to introduce the preceding speeches  I was then stating that the first policy of the Government party was silence and the next cla∣morous contempt but as people generally choose to read and judge for themselves the work still went on and the affectation of contempt like the silence that preceded it passed for nothing  Thus foiled in their second scheme their evil genius like a willwithawisp led them to a third when all at once as if it had been unfolded to them by a fortuneteller or Mr Dundas had discovered it by second sight this once harmless insignificant book without undergoing the altera∣tion of a single letter became a most wicked and dangerous Libel The whole Cabinet like a ship's crew became alarmed all hands were piped upon deck as if a conspiracy of elements was forming around them and out came the Proclamation and the Prosecution and Addresses supplied the place of prayers  Ye silly swains thought I to myself why do you torment yourselves thus The RIGHTS OF MAN is a book calmy and rationally written why then are you so disturbed Did you see how little or how suspicious such conduct makes you appear even cunning alone had you no other faculty would hush you into prudence The plans principles and arguments contained in that work are placed before the eyes of the nation and of the world in a fair open and manly manner and nothing more is necessary than to refute them Do this and the whole is done but if ye cannot so neither can ye supress the reading nor convict the Author for that Law in the opinion of all good men would convict itself that should condemn what cannot be refuted  Having now shewn the Addressers the several stages of the business prior to their being called  upon like Caesar in the Tyber crying to Cassius  "help Cassius or I sink"  I next come to remark on the policy of the Government in promoting Addresses on the consequences naturally resulting therefrom and on the conduct of the persons con∣cerned  With respect to the policy it evidently carries with it every mark and feature of disguised fear And it will hereafter be placed in the history of extraordinary things that a pamphlet should be produced by an individual unconnected with any sect or party and not seeking to make any and almost a stranger in the land that should com∣pleatly frighten a whole Government and that in the midst of its most triumphant security Such a circumstance cannot fail to prove that either the pamphlet has irresistible powers or the Govern∣ment very extraordinary defects or both The Nation exhibits no signs of fear at the Rights of Man why then should the Government unless the interest of the two are really opposite to each other and the secret is beginning to be known That there are two distinct classes of men in the nation those who pay taxes and those who receive and live upon the taxes is evident at first sight and when taxation is carried to excess it cannot fail to disunite those two and something of this kind is now beginning to appear  It is also curious to observe amidst all the fume and bustle about Proclamations and Addresses kept up by a few noisy and interested men how  little the mass of the nation seem to care about either They appear to me by the indifference they shew not to believe a word the Proclamation contains and as to the Addresses they travel to London with the silence of a funeral and having announced their arrival in the Gazette are depo∣sited with ashes of their predecessors and Mr Dundas writes their  hic jacet  One of the best effects which the Proclamation and its echo the Addresses have had has been that of exciting and spreading curiosity and it re∣quires only a single reflection to discover that the object of all curiosity is knowledge When the mass of the nation saw that Placemen Bensioners and Boroughmongers were the persons that stood forward to promote Addresses it could not fail to create suspicious that the public good was not their object that the character of the books or writings to which such persons obscurely alluded not daring to mention them was directly contrary to what they described them to be and that it was necessary that every man for his own satisfaction should exercise his proper right and read and judge for himself  But how will the persons who have been in∣duced to read the  Rights of Man  by the clamour that has been raised against it be surprized to find that instead of a wicked inflamatory work in∣stead of a licencious and profligate performance it abounds with principles of government that are uncontrovertiblewith arguments which every  reader will feel are unanswerablewith plans for the increase of commerce and manufacturesfor the extinction of warfor the education of the children of the poorfor the comfortable support of the aged and decayed persons of both sexes for the relief of the army and navy and in short for the promotion of every thing that can benefit the moral civil and political condition of Man  Why then some calm observer will ask why is the work prosecuted if these be the goodly mat∣ters it contains I will tell thee friend it contains also a plan for the reduction of Taxes for lessening the immense expences of Government for abo∣lishing sinecure Places and Pensions and it pro∣poses applying the redundant taxes that shall be saved by these reforms to the purposes men∣tioned in the former paragraph instead of apply∣ing them to the support of idle and profligate Placemen and Pensioners  Is it then any wonder that Placemen and Pen∣sioners and the whole train of Court expectants should become the promoters of Addresses Pro∣clamations and Prosecutions or is it any wonder that Corporations and rotten Boroughs which are attacked and exposed both in the First and Se∣cond Parts of  Rights of Man  as unjust monopolies and public nuisances should join in the cavalcade Yet these are the sources from which Addresses have sprung Had not such persons come for∣ward to oppose the  Rights of Man  I should have doubted the efficacy of my own writings but  those opposers have now proved to me that the blow was well directed and they have done it justice by confessing the smart  The principal deception in this business of Ad∣dresses has been that the promoters of them have not come forward in their proper characters They have assumed to pass themselves upon the Public as a part of the Public bearing a share of the bur∣then of Taxes and acting for the public good whereas they are in general that part of it that adds to the public burthen by living on the pro∣duce of the public taxes They are to the pub∣lic what the locusts are to the tree the burthen would be less and the prosperity would be greater if they were shaken off  "I do not come here" said ONSLOW at the Surry County meeting  as Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the county but I come here as a plain country gentleman  The fact is that he came there as what he was and as no other and consequently he came as one of the beings I have been describing If it be the cha∣racter of a gentleman to be fed by the public as a pauper is by the parish Onslow has a fair claim to the title and the same description will suit the Duke of Richmond who led the Address at the Sussex meetingHe also may set up for a gen∣tleman  As to the meeting in the next adjoining county Kent it was a scene of disgrace About two hundred persons met when a small part of them  drew privately away from the rest and voted an Address the consequence of which was that they got together by the ears and produced a riot in the very act of producing an Address to prevent Riots  That the Proclamation and the Addresses have failed of their intended effect may be collected from the silence which the Government party it∣self observes The number of Addresses has been weekly retailed in the Gazette but the number of Addressers has been concealed Several of the Addresses have been voted by not more than ten or twelve persons and a considerable number of them by not more than thirty The whole num∣ber of Addresses presented at the time of writing this letter is three hundred and twenty rotten Boroughs and Corporations included and even admitting on an average one hundred Addressers to each Address the whole number of Addressers would be but thirtytwo thousand and nearly three months have been taken up in procuring this num∣ber That the success of the Proclamation has been less than the success of the Work it was in∣tended to discourage is a matter within my own knowledge for a greater number of the cheap edition of the First and second Parts of RIGHT OF MAN has been sold in the space only of one month than the whole number of Addressers admitting them to be thirtytwo thousand have amounted to in three months  It is a dangerous attempt in any Government to say to a Nation  "thou shalt not read"  This is now done in Spain and was formerly done under the old Government of France but it served to procure the downfal of the latter and is subverting that of the former and it will have the same ten∣dency in all countries because  thought  by some means or other is got abroad in the world and cannot be restrained though reading may  If  Rights of Man  were a book that deserved the vile description which the promoters of the Ad∣dress have given of it why did not these men prove their charge and satisfy the people by pro∣ducing it and reading it publicly This most certainly ought to have been done and would also have been done had they believed it would have answered their purpose But the fact is that the book contains truths which those timeservers dreaded to hear and dreaded that the people should know and it is now following up the Ad∣dresses in every part of the nation and convicting them of falshoods  Among the unwarrantable proceedings to which the Proclamation has given rise the meetings of the Justices in several of the towns and counties ought to be noticed Those men have assumed to react the farce of General Warrants and to suppress by their own authority whatever publi∣cations they please This is an attempt at power equalled only by the conduct of the minor despots  of the most despotic governments in Europe and yet those Justices affect to call England a Free Country But even this perhaps like the scheme for garrisoning the country by building military barracks is necessary to awaken the country to a sense of its Rights and as such it will have a good effect  Another part of the conduct of such Justices has been that of threatening to take away the li∣cences from taverns and publichouses where the inhabitants of the neighbourhood associated to read and discuss the principles of Government and to inform each other thereon This again is similiar to what is doing in Spain and Russia and the reflection which it cannot fail to suggest is that the principles and conduct of any Govern∣ment must be bad when that Government dreads and startles at discussion and seeks security by a prevention of knowledge  If the Government or the Constitution or by whatever name it be called be that miracle of per∣fection which the Proclamation and the Addresses have trumpeted it forth to be it ought to have defied discussion and investigation instead of dreading it Whereas every attempt it makes either by Proclamation Prosecution or Address to suppress investigation is a confession that it feels itself unable to bear it It is error only and not truth that shrinks from enquiry All the numerous pamphlets and all the newspaper falshood and abuse that have been published  against the "RIGHTS OF MAN" have fallen before it like pointless arrows and in like manner would any work have fallen before the Constitution had the Constitution as it is called been founded on as good political principles as those on which the RIGHTS OF MAN is written  It is a good Constitution for courtiers placeman pensioners boroughholders and the leaders of Parties and these are the men that have been the active leaders of Addresses but it is a bad Constitution for at least ninetynine parts of the nation out of an hundred and this truth is every day making its way  It is bad first because it entails upon the nation the unnecessary expence of supporting three forms and systems of Government at once namely the monarchical the aristocratical and the democra∣tical  Secondly because it is impossible to unite such a discordant composition by any other means than perpetual corruption and therefore the corruption so loudly and so universally complained of is no other than the natural consequence of such an unnatural compound of Governments and in this consists that excellence which the numerous herd of placemen and pensioners so loudly extol and which at the same time occasions that enormous load of taxes under which the rest of the nation groans  Among the mass of national delusions calculat∣ed to amuse and impose upon the multitude the  standing one has been that of flattering them into taxes by calling the Government or as they please to express it the English constitution  the envy and the admiration of the world  Scarcely an Address has been voted in which some of the speakers have not uttered this hackneyed non∣sensical falshood  Two Revolutions have taken place those of America and France and both of them have re∣jected the unnatural compounded system of the English government America has declared against all hereditary Government and established the re∣presentative system of Government only France has entirely rejected the aristocratical part and is now discovering the absurdity of the monarchical and is approaching fast to the representative system On what ground then do those men con∣tinue a declaration respecting what they call the  envy and admiration of other nations  which the voluntary practice of such nations as have had the opportunity of establishing Government contra∣dicts and falsifies Will such men never confine themselves to truth Will they be for ever the de∣ceivers of the people  But I will go farther and shew that were Go∣vernment now to begin in England the people could not be brought to establish the same system they now submit to  In speaking upon this subject or on any other  on the pure ground of principle  antiquity and pre∣cedent  cease to be authority and hoaryheaded error loses its effect The reasonableness and propriety of things must be examined abstractedly from custom and usage and in this point of view the right which grows into practice today is as much a right and as old in principle and theory as if it had the customary sanction of a thousand ages Principles have no connection with time nor characters with names  To say that the Government of this country is composed of King Lords and Commons is the mere phraseology of custom It is composed of men and whoever the men be to whom the Go∣vernment of any country is entrusted they ought to be the best and wisest that can be found and if they are not so they are not fit for the station A man derives no more excellence from the change of a name or calling him King or calling him Lord than I should do by changing my name from Thomas to George or from Paine to Guelph I should not be a whit the more able to write a book because my name were altered neither would any man now called a King or a Lord have a whit the more sense than he now has were he to call himself Thomas Paine  As to the word "Commons" applied as it is in England it is a term of degradation and re∣proach and ought to be abolished It is a term unknown in free countries  But to the pointLet us suppose that Govern∣ment was now to begin in England and that the plan of Government offered to the nation for its  approbation or rejection consisted of the following parts  FirstThat some one individual should be taken from all the rest of the nation and to whom all the rest should swear obedience and never be permitted to sit down in his presence and that they should give to him one million sterling a yearThat the nation should never after have power or authority to make laws but with his express consent and that his sons and his sons' sons whether wise or foolish good men or bad fit or unfit should have the same power and also the same money annually paid to them for ever  SecondlyThat there should be two houses of Legislators to assist in making laws one of which should in the first instance be entirely appointed by the aforesaid person and that their sons and their sons' sons whether wise or foolish good men or bad fit or unfit should for ever after be hereditary Legislators  ThirdlyThat the other house should be chosen in the same manner as the house now called the House of Commons is chosen and should be sub∣ject to the controul of the two aforesaid hereditary Powers in all things  It would be impossible to cram such a farago of imposition and absurdity down the throat of this or any other nation that were capable of reasoning upon its rights and its interest  They would ask in the first place on what ground of right or on what principle such ir∣rational  and preposterous distinctions could or ought to be made and what pretensions any man could have or what services he could render to entitle him to a million a year They would go farther and revolt at the idea of consigning their children and their childrens' children to the do∣mination of persons hereafter to be born who might for any thing they could foresee turn out to be knaves or fools and they would finally discover that the project of hereditary Governors and Legislators  was a treasonable usurpation over the rights of posterity  Not only the calm dictates of reason and the force of natural affection but the integrity of manly pride would impel men to spurn such proposals  From the grosser absurdities of such a scheme they would extend their examination to the prac∣tical defectsThey would soon see that it would end in tyranny accomplished by fraud That in the operation of it it would be two to one against them because the two parts that were to be made hereditary would form a common interest and stick to each other and that themselves and their representatives would become no better than hewers of wood and drawers of water for the other parts of the GovernmentYet call one of those powers King the other Lords and the third the Com∣mons and it gives the model of what is called the English Government  I have asserted and have shewn both in the First and second Parts of  Rights of Man  that  there is not such a thing as an English Consti∣tution and that the people have yet a Consti∣tution to form  A Constitution is a thing ante∣cedent to a Government it is the act of the people creating a Government and giving it powers and defining the limits and exercise of the powers so given  But whenever did the people of England acting in their original constituent character by a delegation elected for the express purpose declare and say  We the people of this land do constitute and appoint this to be our system and form of Government  The Government has assumed to constitute itself but it never was constituted by the people in whom alone the right of constituting resides  I will here recite the preamble to the Federal Constitution of the United States of America I have shewn in the Second Part of  rights of Man  the manner by which the Constitution was formed and afterwards ratified and to which I refer the readerThe preamble is in the following words  WE THE PEOPLE of the United States in order to form a more perfect union esta∣blish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for common defence promote the general welfare secure the blessings of li∣berty to ourselves and our posterity DO OR∣DAIN AND ESTABISH THIS CONSTITUTION for the United States of America  Then follow the several articles which appoint the manner in which the several component parts of the Government legislative and executive shall be elected and the period of their duration and the powers they shall have also the manner by which future additions alterations or amendments shall be made to the Constitution Consequently every improvement that can be made in the science of Government follows in that country as a matter of order It is only in Governments founded on assumption and false principles that reasoning upon and investigating systems and prin∣ciples of Government and shewing their several excellencies and defects are termed libellous and seditious These terms were made part of the charge brought against Locke Hampden and Sydney and will continue to be brought against all good men so long as had government shall continue  The Government of this country has been os∣tentatiously giving challenges for more than an hundred years past upon what it called its own excellence and perfection Scarcely a King's Speech or a Parliamentary Speech has been utter∣ed in which this glove has not been thrown till the world has been insulted with their challenges But it now appears that all this was vapour and vain boasting or that it was intended to conceal abuses and defects and hush the people into taxes I have taken the challenge up and in behalf of the public have shewn in a fair open and candid man∣ner  both the radical and practical defects of the system when lo those champions of the Civil Lift have fled away and sent the AttorneyGeneral to deny the challenge by turning the acceptance of it into an attack and defending their Places and Pensions by a prosecution  I will here drop this part of the subject and state a few particulars respecting the prosecution now pending by which the Addressers will see that they have been used as tools to the prosecuting party and their dependents The case is as follows  The original edition of the First and Second Parts of RIGHTS OF MAN having been expen∣sively printed in the modern stile of printing pamphlets that they might be bound up with Mr Burke's Reflections on the French Revolution the high price precluded the generality of people from purchasing and many applications were made to me from various parts of the country to print the work in a cheaper manner The people of Sheffield requested leave to print two thousand copies for themselves with which request I immediately complied The same request came to me from Rotherham from Leicester from Chester from se∣veral towns in Scotland and Mr James Mack∣intosh Author of  Vindicia Gailica  brought me a request from Warwickshire for leave to print ten thousand copies in that country I had already sent a cheap edition to Scotland and finding the ap∣plications increase I concluded that the best method of complying therewith would be to print a very  numerous edition in London under my own di∣rection by which means the work would be more perfect and the price be reduced lower than it could be by  printing  small editions in the country of only a few thousands each  The cheap edition of the First Part was begun about the middle of last April and from that mo∣ment and not before I expected a prosecution and the event has proved that I was not mistaken I had then occasion to write to Mr Thomas Walker of Manchester and after informing him of my intention of giving up the work for the pur∣pose of general information I informed him of what I apprehended would be the consequence that while the work was at a price that precluded an extensive circulation the Governmentparty not able to controvert the plans arguments and principles it contained had chosen to remain si∣lent but that I expected they would make an attempt to deprive the mass of the nation and especially the poor of the right of reading by the pretence of prosecuting either the Author or the Publisher or both They chose to begin with the Publisher  Nearly a month however passed before I had any information given me of their intentions I was then at Bromley in Kent upon which I came immediately to town May and went to Mr Jordan the publisher of the original edition He had that evening been served with a summons to appear at the Court of King's Bench on the Mon∣day  following but for what purpose was not stated Supposing it to be on account of the work I appointed a meeting with him on the next morn∣ing which was accordingly had when I provided an attorney and took the expence of the defence on myself But finding afterwards that he absent∣ed himself from the attorney employed and had en∣gaged another and that he had been closeted with the Solicitors of the Treasury I left him to follow his own choice and he chose to plead Guilty This he might do if he pleased and I make no objec∣tion against him for it I believe that his idea by the word  Guilty  was no other than declaring him∣self to be the publisher without any regard to the merits or demerits of the work for were it to be construed otherwise it would amount to the ab∣surdity of converting a publisher into a Jury and his confession into a verdict upon the work itself This would be the highest possible refinement upon packing of Juries  On the st of May they commenced their pro∣secution against me as the Author by leaving a summons at my lodgings in town to appear at the Court of King's Bench on the th of June fol∣lowing and on the same day May  they issued also their Proclamation  Thus the Court of St James's and the Court of King's Bench were playing into each other's hands at the same instant of time and the farce of Addresses brought up the rear and this mode of proceeding is called by the prostituted name of Law Such a thundering ra∣pidity  after a ministerial dormancy of almost eigh∣teen months can be attributed to no other cause than their having gained information of the for∣wardness of the cheap Edition and the dread they felt at the progressive increase of political know∣ledge  I was strongly advised by several gentlemen as well those in the practice of the Law as others to prefer a bill of indictment against the publisher of the Proclamation as a publication tending to in∣fluence or rather to dictate the verdict of a Jury on the issue of a matter then pending but it appeared to me much better to avail myself of the opportu∣nity which such a precedent justified me in using by meeting the Proclamation and the Addresses on their own ground and publicly defending the Work which had been thus unwarrantable attacked and traducedAnd conscious as I now am that the Work entitled RIGHTS OF MAN so far from being as has been maliciously or erroneously re∣presented a false wicked and seditious Libel is a work abounding with unanswerable truths with principles of the purest morality and benevolence and with arguments not to be controvertedCon∣scious I say of these things and having no object in view but the happiness of mankind I have now put the matter to the best proof in my power by giving to the public a cheap edition of the First and Second Parts of that Work Let every man read and judge for himself not only of the merits or demerits of the Work but of the matters therein  contained which relate to his own interest and happiness  If to expose the fraud and imposition of monar∣chy and every species of hereditary government to lessen the oppression of taxesto propose plans for the education of helpless infancy and the com∣fortable support of the aged and distressedto en∣deavour to conciliate nations to each otherto ex∣tirpate the horrid practice of warto promote universal peace civilization and commerceand to break the chains of political superstition and raise degraded man to his proper rankif these things be libellous let me live the life of a Libeller and let the name of LIBELLER be engraven on my tomb  Of all the weak and illjudged measures which fear ignorance or arrogance could suggest the Proclamation and the project for Addresses are two of the worst They served to advertise the work which the promoters of those measures wished to keep unknown and in doing this they offered violence to the judgment of the people by calling on them to condemn what they forbad them to know and they put the strength of their party to that hazardous issue that prudence would have avoidedThe County Meeting for Middlesex was attended by only one hundred and eighteen Ad∣dressers They no doubt expected that thousands would slock to their standard and clamour against the  Rights of Man  But the case most probably is that men in all countries are not so blind to  their Rights and their Interest as Governments be∣lieve  Having thus shewn the extraordinary manner in which the Governmentparty commenced their at∣tack I proceed to offer a few observations on the prosecution and on the mode of trial by Special Jury  In the first place I have written a book and if it cannot be refuted it cannot be condemned But I do not consider the prosecution as particularly levelled against me but against the general right or the right of every man of investigating systems and principles of Government and shewing their several excellencies or defects If the press be free only to flatter Government as Mr Burke has done and to cry up and extol what certain Court sycophants are pleased to call a  glorious Consti∣tution  and not free to examine into its errors or abuses or whether a Constitution really exist or not such freedom is no other than that of Spain Turkey or Russia and a Jury in this case would not be a Jury to try but an Inquisition to con∣demn  I have asserted and by fair and open argument maintained the right of every nation at all times to establish such a system and form of Government for itself as best accords with its disposition in∣terest and happiness and to change or alter it as it sees occasion Will any Jury deny to the Nation this right If they do they are traitors and their Verdict would be null and void And  if they admit the right the means must be admit∣ted also for it would be the highest absurdity to say that the right existed but the means did not The question then is What are the means by which the possession and exercise of this National Right are to the secured The answer will be that of maintaining inviolably the right of free inves∣tigation for investigation always serves to detect error and to bring forth truth  I have as an individual given my opinion upon what I believe to be not only the best but the true system of Government which is the repre∣sentative system and I have given reasons for that opinion  First Because in the representative system no office of very extraordinary power or extravagant pay is attached to any individual and conse∣quently there is nothing to excite those national contentions and civil wars with which countries under monarchical governments are frequently convulsed and of which the History of England exhibits such numerous instances  Secondly Because the representative is a system of Government always in maturity whereas mo∣narchical government fluctuates through all the stages from nonage to dotage  Thirdly Because the representative system ad∣mits of none but men properly qualified into the Government or removes them if they prove to be otherwise Whereas in the hereditary system a nation may be encumbered with a knave or an  ideot for a whole lifetime and not be benefited by a successor  Fourthly Because there does not exist a right to establish hereditary government or in other words hereditary successors because hereditary government always means a government yet to come and the case always is that those who are to live afterwards have always the same right to establish government for themselves as the people had who lived before them and therefore all laws attempting to establish hereditary government are founded on assumption and political fiction  If these positions be truths and I challenge any man to prove the contrary if they tend to in∣struct and enlighten mankind and to free them from error oppression and political superstition which are the objects I have in view in publishing them that Jury would commit an act of injustice to their country and to me if not a act of per∣jury that should call them  false wicked  and  ma∣licious  Dragonetti in his treatise "on Virtues and Re∣wards" has a paragraph worthy of being recorded in every country in the world  The science says he of the politician consists in fixing the true point of happiness and freedom Those men would deserve the gratitude of ages who should discover a mode of government that con∣tained the greatest sum of  individual happiness  with the least  national expence  But if Juries are to be made use of to prohibit enquiry to sup∣press  truth and to stop the progress of knowledge this boasted palladium of liberty becomes the most successful instrument of tyranny  Among the arts practised at the Bar and from the Bench to impose upon the understanding of a Jury and obtain a Verdict where the consciences of men could not otherwise consent one of the most successful has been that of calling  truth a libel  and of insinuating that the words  falsely wickedly  and  maliciously  though they are made the for∣midable and high sounding part of the charge are not matters for consideration with a Jury For what purpose then are they retained unless it be for that of imposition and wilful defamation  I cannot conceive a greater violation of order nor a more abominable insult upon morality and upon human understanding than to see a man sit∣ting in the judgment seat affecting by an anti∣quated foppery of dress to impress the audience with awe then causing witnesses and Jury to be sworn to truth and justice himself having offici∣ally sworn the same then causing to be read a pro∣secution against a man charging him with having  wickedly and maliciously written and published a cer∣tain false wicked and seditious book  and having gone through all this with a shew of solemnity as if he saw the eye of the Almighty darting through the roof of the building like a ray of light turn in an instant the whole into a farce and in order to obtain a verdict that could not otherwise be ob∣tained tell the Jury that the charge of  falsely wick∣edly  and seditiously  meant nothing that  truth  was out of the question and that whether the person accused spoke truth or falshood or intended  virtu∣ously or wickedly  was the same thing and finally conclude the wretched inquisitorial scene by stat∣ing some antiquated precedent equally as abomina∣ble as that which is then acting or giving some opinion of his own and  falsely calling the one and the otherLaw  It was most probably to such a Judge as this that the most solemn of all reproofs was given  The Lord will smite thee thou whit∣ened wall  I now proceed to offer some remarks on what is called a Special JuryAs to what is called a Spe∣cial Verdict I shall make no other remark upon it than that it is in reality  not  a verdict It is an attempt on the part of the Jury to delegate or of the Bench to obtain the exercise of that right which is committed to the Jury only  With respect to Special Juries I shall state such matters as I have been able to collect for I do not find any uniform opinion concerning the mode of appointing them  In the first place this mode of trial is but of modern invention and the origin of it as I am told is a follows  Formerly when disputes arose between Mer∣chants and were brought before a Court the case was that the nature of their commerce and the me∣thod of keeping Merchants accounts not being sufficiently understood by persons out of their own  line it became necessary to depart from the com∣mon mode of appointing Juries and to select such persons for a Jury whose  practical knowledge  would enable them to decide upon the case From this introduction Special Juries became more general but some doubts having arisen as to their legality an act was passed in the d of Geo II to establish them as legal and also to extend them to all cases not only between individuals but in cases where  the Government itself should be the Prosecutor  This most probably gave rise to the suspicion so gene∣rally entertained of packing a Jury because by this act when the crown as it is called is the Pro∣secutor the Master of the Crownoffice who holds his office under the Crown is the person who either wholly nominates or has great power in nominating the Jury and therefore it has greatly the appearance of the prosecuting party selecting a Jury  The process is as follows  On motion being made in Court by either the Plaintiff or Defendant for a Special Jury the Court grants it or not at its own discretion  If it be granted the Solicitor of the party that applied for the Special Jury gives notice to the So∣licitor of the adverse party and a day and hour are appointed for them to meet at the office of the Mas∣ter of the Crownoffice The Master of the Crownoffice sends to the Sheriff or his deputy who attends with the Sheriff's book of Freeholders From this book fortyeight names are  taken  and  a copy thereof given to each of the parties and on a future day notice is again given and the Solicitors meet a second time and each strikes out twelve names The list being thus reduced from fortyeight to twentyfour the first twelve that appear in Court and answer to their names is the Special Jury for that cause The first operation that of taking the fortyeight names is called nominating the Jury and the reducing them to twentyfour is called striking the Jury  Having thus stated the general process I come to particulars and the first question will be how are the fortyeight names out of which the Jury is to be struck obtained from the Sheriff's book for herein lies the principal ground of suspicion with respect to what is understood by packing of Juries  Either they must be taken by some rule agreed upon between the parties or by some common rule known and established beforehand or at the dis∣cretion of some person who in such a case ought to be perfectly disinterested in the issue as well officially as otherwise  In the case of Merchants and in all cases between individuals the Master of the office called the Crownoffice is officially an indifferent person and as such may be a proper person to act between the parties and present them with a list of fortyeight names out of which each party is to strike twelve But the case assumes an entire different character when the Government itself is the Prosecutor The Master of the Crownoffice is then an officer  holding his office under the Prosecutor and it is therefore no wonder that the suspicion of packing Juries should in such cases have been so prevalent  This will apply with additional force when the prosecution is commenced against the Author or Publisher of such Works as treat of reforms and of the abolition of superfluous places and offices c because in such cases every person holding an office subject to that suspicion becomes interested as a party and the office called the Crownoffice may upon examination be found to be of this de∣scription  I have heard it asserted that the Master of the Crown office is to open the Sheriff's book as it were per hazard and take thereout fortyeight  fol∣lowing  names to which the word Merchant or Es∣quire is affixed The former of these are cer∣tainly proper when the case is between Merchants and it has reference to the origin of the custom and to nothing else As to the word Esquire every man is an Esquire who pleases to call him∣self Esquire and the sensible part of mankind are leaving it off But the matter for enquiry is whe∣ther there be any existing law to direct the mode by which the fortyeight names shall be taken or whether the mode be merely that of custom which the office has created or whether the selection of the fortyeight names be wholly at the discretion and choice of the Master of the Crownoffice One or other of the two latter appears to be the case be∣cause the act already mentioned of the d of  Geo II lays down no rule or mode nor refers to any preceding lawbut says only that Special Juries shall hereafter be struck  in such manner as Spe∣cial Juries have been and are usually struck  This act appears to me to have been what is generally understood by a  "deep take in"  It was fitted to the spur of the moment in which it was passed d of Geo II when parties ran high and it served to throw into the hands of Walpole who was then Minister the management of Juries in Crown prosecutions by making the nomination of the fortyeight persons from whom the Jury was to be struck follow the precedent established by custom between individuals and by this means it slipt into practice with less suspicion Now the manner of obtaining Special Juries through the medium of an officer of the Government such for instance as a Master of the Crownoffice may be impartial in the case of Merchants or other indivi∣duals but it becomes highly improper and suspici∣ous in cases where the Government itself is one of the parties And it must upon the whole appear a strange inconsistency that a Government should keep one officer to commence prosecutions and another officer to nominate the fortyeight persons from whom the Jury is to be struck both of whom are  officers of the Civil List  and yet continue to call this by the pompous name of  the glorious Right of trial by Jury  In the case of the King against Jordan for pub∣lishing RIGHTS OF MAN the AttorneyGeneral moved for the appointment of a Special Jury and  the Master of the Crownoffice nominated the fortyeight persons himself and took them from such part of the Sheriff's book as he pleased The trial did not come on occasioned by Jordan withdraw∣ing his plea but if it had it might have afforded an opportunity of discussing the subject of Special Juries for though such discussion might have had no effect in the Court of King'sBench it would in the present disposition for enquiry have had a considerable effect upon the Country and in all national reforms this is the proper point to begin at Put a Country right and it will soon put Go∣vernment right Among the improper things acted by the Government in the case of Special Juries on their own motion one has been that of treating the Jury with a dinner and afterwards giving each Juryman two guineas if a verdict be found for the prosecution and only one if otherwise and it has been long observed that in London and West∣minster there are persons who appear to make a trade of serving by being so frequently seen upon Special Juries  Thus much for Special Juries As to what is called a  Common Jury  upon any Government pro∣secution against the Author or Publisher of RIGHTS OF MAN during the time of the  present Sheriffry  I have one question to offer which is  whether the present Sheriffs of London having publicly prejudged the case by the part they have taken in procuring an Address from the county of Middlesex however di∣minutive and insignificant the number of Addressers  were being only one hundred and eighteen are eligi∣ble or proper persons to be entrusted with the power of returning a Jury to try the issue of any such prose∣cution  But the whole matter appears at least to me to be worthy of a more extensive consideration than what relates to any Jury whether Special or Com∣mon for the case is whether any part of a whole nation locally selected as a Jury of twelve men al∣ways is be competent to judge and determine for the whole nation on any matter that relates to systems and principles of Government and whether it be not applying the institution of Juries to pur∣poses for which such institution was not intended For example  I have asserted in the Work RIGHTS OF MAN that as every man in the nation pays taxes so has every man a right to a share in government and consequently that the people of Manchester Bir∣mingham Sheffield Leeds Hallifax c c have the same right as those of London Shall then twelve men picked out between Templebar and Whitechapel because the book happened to be first published there decide upon the rights of the inhabitants of those towns or of any other town or village in the nation  Having thus spoken of Juries I come next to offer a few observations on the matter contained in the information or prosecution  The work RIGHTS OF MAN consists of Part the First and Part the Second The First Part the  prosecutor has thought it most proper to let alone and from the Second Part he has selected a few short paragraphs making in the whole not quite two pages of the same printing as in the cheap edi∣tion Those paragraphs relate chiefly to certain facts such as the Revolution of and the coming of George the First commonly called of the House of Hanover or the House of Brunswick or some such house The arguments plans and princi∣ples contained in the work the prosecutor has not ventured to attack They are beyond his reach  The Act which the prosecutor appears to rest most upon for the support of the prosecution is the Act intituled  An Act declaring the rights and liberties of the subject and settling the succes∣sion of the crown  passed in the first year of William and Mary and more commonly known by the name of the "Bill of Rights"  I have called this Bill  A Bill of wrongs and of insult  My reasons and also my proofs are as fol∣lows  The method and principle which this Bill takes for declaring rights and liberties are in direct con∣tradiction to rights and liberties it is an assumed attempt to take them wholly away from posterityfor the declaration in the said Bill is as follows  The Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons do in  the name of all the people  most humbly and faithfully  submit themselves their heirs and posterity for ever  that is to William  and Mary his wife their heirs and successors This is a strange way of declaring rights and liberties But the Parliament who made this declaration in the name and on the part of the people had no authority from them for so doingand with respect to  posterity for ever  they had no right or authority whatever in the case It was assumption and usur∣pation I have reasoned very extensively against the principle of this Bill in the first part of Rights of Man the prosecutor has silently admitted that reasoning and he now commences a prosecution on the authority of the Bill after admitting the rea∣soning against it  It is also to be observed that the declaration in this Bill abject and irrational as it is had no other intentional operation than against the family of the Stuarts and their abettors The idea did not then exist that in the space of an hundred years poste∣rity might discover a different and much better system of government and that every species of here∣ditary government might fall as Popes and Monks had fallen before This I say was not then thought of and therefore the application of the Bill in the present case is a new erroneous and illegal application and is the same as creating a new Bill  ex post facto  I has ever been the craft of Courtiers for the purpose of keeping up an expensive and enormous Civil Lift and a mummery of useless and anti∣quated places and offices at the public expence to  be continually hanging England upon some indivi∣dual or other called  king  though the man might not have capacity to be a parish constable The folly and absurdity of this is appearing more and more every day and still those men continue to act as if no alteration in the public opinion had taken place They hear each other's nonsense and sup∣pose the whole nation talks the same Gibberish  Let such men cry up the House of Orange or the House of Brunswick if they please They would cry up any other house if it suited their pur∣pose and give as good reasons for it But what is this house or that house or any house to a nation  For a nation to be free it is sufficient that she wills it  Her freedom depends wholly upon her∣self and not on any house nor on any individual I ask not in what light this cargo of foreign houses appears to others but I will say in what light it appears to meIt was like the trees of the forest saying unto the bramble come thou and reign over us  Thus much for both their houses I now come to speak of two other houses which are also put into the information and those are the House of Lords and the House of Commons Here I sup∣pose the AttorneyGeneral intends to prove me guilty of speaking either truth or falshood for ac∣cording to the modern interpretation of Libels it does not signify which and the only improvement necessary to shew the compleat absurdity of such  doctrine would be to prosecute a man for utter∣ing a most  false and wicked truth  I will quote the part I am going to give from the office Copy with the Attorney General's inuen∣does enclosed in parentheses as they stand in the in∣formation and I hope that civil list officer will cau∣tion the Court not to laugh when he reads them and also to take care not to laugh himself  The information states that  Thomas Paine being a wicked malicious seditious and evildisposed per∣son hath with force and arms and most wicked cun∣ning written and published a certain false scandalous malicious and seditious libel in one part thereof to the tenor and effect following that is to say    With respect to the two Houses of which the English Parliament  meaning the Parliament of this Kingdom  is composed they appear to be effectually influenced into one and as a Legis∣lature to have no temper of its own The Mi∣nister  meaning the Minister employed by the King of this Realm in the administration of the Govern∣ment thereof  whoever he at any time may be touches IT  meaning the two Houses of Parlia∣ment of this Kingdom  as with an opium wand and IT  meaning the two Houses of Parliament of this Kingdom  sleeps obedience  As I am not ma∣licious enough to disturb their repose though it be time they should awake I leave the two Houses and the Attorney General to the enjoyment of their dreams and proceed to a new subject  The Gentlemen to whom I shall next address my∣self are those who have stiled themselves  Friends of the people  holding their meeting at the Free∣masons' Tavern London  One of the principal Members of this Society is Mr Grey who I believe is also one of the most independent Members in Parliament I collect this opinion from what Mr Burke formerly mentioned to me rather than from any knowledge of my own The occasion was as follows  I was in England at the time the bubble broke forth about Nootka Sound and the day after the King's Message as it is called was sent to Parlia∣ment I wrote a note to Mr Burke that upon the condition the French Revolution should not be a subject for he was then writing the book I have since answered I would call on him the next day and mention some matters I was acquainted with respecting that affair for it appeared to me extra∣ordinary that any body of men calling themselves Representatives should commit themselves so pre∣cipitately or "sleep obedience" as Parliament was then doing and run a nation into expence and perhaps a war without so much as enquiring into the case or the subject of both which I had some knowledge  When I saw Mr Burke and mentioned the cir∣cumstances to him he particularly spoke of Mr Grey as the fittest Member to bring such matters forward for said Mr Burke  I am not the pro∣per  person to do it as I am in a treaty with Mr Pitt about Mr Hastings's trial  I hope the At∣torney General will allow that Mr Burke was then  sleeping his obedience  But to return to the Society  I cannot bring myself to believe that the general motive of this Society is any thing more than that by which every former parliamentary opposition has been governed and by which the present is sufficiently known Failing in their pursuit of power and place within doors they have now and that not in a very mannerly manner endeavoured to possess themselves of that ground out of doors which had it not been made by others would not have been made by them They appear to me to have watched with more cunning than candour the progress of a certain publication and when they saw it had excited a spirit of enquiry and was ra∣pidly spreading they stepped forward to profit by the opportunity and Mr Fox  then  called it a Libel In saying this he libelled himself Politicians of this cast such I mean as those who trim between parties and lye by for events are to be found in every country and it never yet happened that they did not do more harm than good They embar∣rass business fritter it to nothing perplex the people and the event to themselves generally is that they go just far enough to make enemies of the few without going far enough to make friends of the many  Whoever will read the declarations of this So∣ciety of the th of April and th of May will find a studied reserve upon all the points that are real abuses They speak not once of the extrava∣gance of Government of the abominable list of un∣necessary and sinecure places and pensions of the enormity of the Civil List of the excess of taxes nor of any one matter that substantially affects the nation and from some conversation that has passed in that Society it does not appear to me that it is any part of their plan to carry this class of reforms into practice No Opposition Party ever did when it gained possession  In making these free observations I mean not to enter into contention with this Society their inci∣vility towards me is what I should expect from placehunting reformers They are welcome how∣ever to the ground they have advanced upon and I wish that every individual among them may act in the same upright uninfluenced and public spi∣rited manner that I have done Whatever reforms may be obtained and by whatever means they will be for the benefit of others and not of me I have no other interest in the cause than the interest of my heart The part I have acted has been wholly that of a volunteer unconnected with party and when I quit it shall be as honourably as I began  I consider the reform of Parliament by an ap∣plication to Parliament as proposed by the Society  to be a wornout hackneyed subject about which the nation is tired and the parties are deceiving each other It is not a subject that is cognizable before Parliament because no Government has a right to alter itself either in whole or in part The right and the exercise of that right apper∣tains to the nation only and the proper mean is by a national convention elected for the purpose by all the people By this the will of the nation whether to reform or not or what the reform shall be or how far it shall extend will be known and it cannot be known by any other means Partial addresses or separate associations are not testi∣monies of the general will  It is however certain that the opinions of men with respect to systems and principles of govern∣ment are changing fast in all countries The al∣teration in England within the space of little more than a year is far greater than could then have been believed and it is daily and hourly increasing It moves along the country with the silence of thought The enormous expence of Government has provoked men to think by making them feel and the Proclamation has served to increase jealousy and disgust To prevent therefore those commo∣tions which too often and too suddenly arise from suffocated discontents it is best that the general WILL should have the full and free opportunity of being publicly ascertained and known  Wretched as the state of representation is in England it is every day becoming worse because the unrepresented parts of the nation are increasing in population and property and the represented parts are decreasing It is therefore no ill grounded estimation to say that as not one person in seven is represented at least fourteen millions of taxes out of the seventeen millions are paid by the unrepresented part for although copyholds and leaseholds are assessed to the landtax the holders are unrepresented Should then a general demur take place as to the obligation of paying taxes on the ground of not being represented it is not the Representatives of rotten Boroughs nor Special Juries that can decide the question This is one of the possible cases that ought to be foreseen in order to prevent the inconveniencies that might arise to numerous individuals by provoking it  I confess I have no idea of petitioning for rights Whatever the rights of people are they have a right to them and none have a right either to withhold them or to grant them Government ought to be established on such principles of justice as to exclude the occasion of all such applications for wherever they appear they are virtually accu∣sations  I wish that Mr Grey since he has embarked in the business would take the whole of it into con∣sideration He will then see that the right of re∣forming the state of the Representation does not  reside in Parliament and that the only motion he could consistently make would be that Parliament should  recommend  the election of a convention by all the people because all pay taxes But whether Parliament recommended it or not the right of the nation would neither be lessened nor increased thereby  As to Petitions from the unrepresented part they ought not to be looked for As well might it be expected that Manchester Sheffield c should petition the rotten Boroughs as that they should petition the Representatives of those Bo∣roughs Those two towns alone pay far more taxes than all the rotten Boroughs put together and it is scarcely to be expected they should pay their court either to the Boroughs or the Boroughmongers  It ought also to be observed that what is called Parliament is composed of two houses that have always declared against the right of each other to interfere in any matter that related to the circum∣stances of either particularly that of election A reform therefore in the representation cannot on the ground they have individually taken become the subject of an act of Parliament because such a mode would include the interference against which the Commons on their part have protested but must as well on the ground of formality as on that of right proceed from a National Convention  Let Mr Grey or any other man sit down and endeavour to put his thoughts together for the purpose of drawing up an application to Parliament for a reform of Parliament and he will soon con∣vince himself of the folly of the attempt He will find that he cannot get on that he cannot make his thoughts join so as to produce any effect for whatever formality of words he may use they will unavoidably include two ideas directly opposed to each other the one in setting forth the reasons the other in praying for the relief and the two when placed together would stand thus  The Representation in Parliament is so very corrupt that we can no longer confide in itand there∣fore confiding in the justice and wisdom of Parlia∣ment we pray  c c  The heavy manner in which every former pro∣posed application to Parliament has dragged suffi∣ciently shews that though the nation might not exactly see the awkwardness of the measure it could not clearly see its way by that mean To this also may be added another remark which is that the worse Parliament is the less will be the in∣clination to petition it This indifference viewed as it ought to be is one of the strongest censures the public can express It is as if they were to say "Ye are not worth reforming"  Let any man examine the CourtKalendar of Placemen in both Houses and the manner in which the Civil List operates and he will be at  no loss to account for this indifference and want of confidence on one side nor of the opposition to reforms on the other  Besides the numerous list of paid persons exhi∣bited in the CourtKalendar which so indecently stares the nation in the face there is an unknown number of masked Pensioners which renders Par∣liament still more suspected  Who would have supposed that Mr Burke holding forth as he formerly did against secret in∣fluence and corrupt majorities should become a concealed Pensioner I will now state the case not for the little purpose of exposing Mr Burke but to shew the inconsistency of any application to a body of men more than half of whom as far as the nation can at present know may be in the same case with himself  Towards the end of Lord North's administra∣tion Mr Burke brought a bill into Parliament generally known by the name of Mr Burke's Reform Bill in which among other things it is enacted  That no pension exceeding the sum of three hundred pounds a year shall be granted to any one person and that the whole amount of the pensions granted in one year shall not exceed six hundred pounds a list of which together with the  names of the persons  to whom the same are granted shall be laid before Par∣liament in twenty days after the beginning of each session until the whole pension list shall be  reduced to ninety thousand pounds  A provisory clause is afterwards added  That it shall be lawful for the First Commissioner of the Treasury to return into the Exchequer any pension or an∣nuity  without a name  on his making oath that such pension or annuity is not directly or indi∣rectly for the benefit use or behoof of any Member of the House of Commons  But soon after that Administration ended and the party Mr Burke acted with came into power it appears from the circumstances I am going to relate that Mr Burke became himself a Pensioner in disguise in a similiar manner as if a pension had been granted in the name of John Nokes to be privately paid to and enjoyed by Tom Stiles The name of Edmund Burke does not appear in the ori∣ginal transaction but after the pension was ob∣tained Mr Burke wanted to make the most of it at once by selling or mortgaging it and the gen∣tleman in whose name the pension stands applied to one of the public offices for that purpose This unfortunately brought forth the name of  Edmund Burke  as the real Pensioner of l per annum When men trumpet forth what they call the bles∣sings of the Constitution it ought to be known what sort of blessings they allude to  As to the Civil List of a million a year it is not to be supposed that any one man can eat drink or consume the whole upon himself The case is that above half this sum is annually apportioned among  Courtiers and Court Members of both Houses in places and offices altogether insignificant and per∣fectly useless as to every purpose of civil rational and manly government For instance  Of what use in the science and system of Govern∣ment is what is called a Lord Chamberlain a Ma∣ster and a Mistress of the Robes a Master of the Horse a Master of the Hawks and an hundred other such things Laws derive no additional force nor additional excellence from such mummery  In the disbursements of the Civil List for the year which may be seen in Sir John Sinclair's History of the Revenue are four separate charges for this mummery office of Chamberlain  st  £    d    d      th                 besides £ charged for Alms  From this sample the rest may be guessed at As to the Master of the Hawks there are no hawks kept and if there were it is no reason the people should pay the expence of feeding them many of whom are put to it to get bread for their children his salary is  l    s  And besides a list of items of this kind sufficient to fill a quire of paper the Pension lists alone are  l    s    d  which is a greater sum than  all the expences of the federal Government in Ame∣rica amount to  Among the items there are two I had no expecta∣tion of finding and which in this day of enquiry after Civil List influence ought to be exposed The one is an annual payment of one thousand seven hundred pounds to the Dissenting Ministers in Eng∣land and eight hundred pounds to those of Ireland  This is the fact and the distribution  as I am in∣formed  is as follows The whole sum of £ is paid to one person a dissenting Minister in Lon∣don who divides it among eight others and those eight among such others as they please The Lay∣body of the Dissenters and many of their principal Ministers have long considered it as dishonourable and have endeavoured to prevent it but still it continues to be secretly paid and as the world has sometimes seen very fulsome Addresses from parts of that body it may naturally be supposed that the receivers like Bishops and other CourtClergy are not idle in promoting them How the money is distributed in Ireland I know not  To recount all the secret history of the Civil List is not the intention of this publication It is suffi∣cient in this place to expose its general character and the mass of influence it keeps alive It will necessarily become one of the objects of reform and therefore enough is said to shew that under its operation no application to Parliament can be ex∣pected to succeed nor can consistently be made  Such reforms will not be promoted by the Party that is in possession of those places nor by the Op∣position who are waiting for them and as to a  mere reform  in the state of the Representation under the idea that another Parliament differently elected to the present but still a component third part of the same system and subject to the controul of the other two parts will abolish those abuses is altogether delusion because it is not only impracticable on the ground of formality but is unwisely exposing another set of men to the same corruptions that have tainted the present  Were all the objects that require a reform ac∣complishable by a mere reform in the state of the Representation the persons who compose the pre∣sent Parliament might with rather more propriety be asked to abolish all the abuses themselves than be applied to as the mere instruments of doing it by a future Parliament If the virtue be wanting to abolish the abuse it is also wanting to act as the means and the nation must of necessity proceed by some other plan  Having thus endeavoured to shew what the ab∣ject condition of Parliament is and the impropriety of going a second time over the same ground that has before miscarried I come to the remaining part of the subject  There ought to be in the constitution of every country a mode of referring back on any extraor∣dinary occasion to the sovereign and original con∣stituent  power which is the nation itself The right of altering any part of a Government cannot as already observed reside in the Government or that Government might make itself what it pleased  It ought also to be taken for granted that though a nation may feel inconveniencies either in the ex∣cess of taxation or in the mode of expenditure or in any thing else it may not at first be sufficiently assured in what part of its government the defect lies or where the evil originates It may be sup∣posed to be in one part and on enquiry be found to be in another or partly in all This obscurity is naturally interwoven with what are called mixed Governments  Be however the reform to be accomplished whatever it may it can only follow in consequence of first obtaining a full knowledge of all the causes that have rendered such reform necessary and every thing short of this is guesswork or frivolous cunning In this case it cannot be supposed that any application to Parliament can bring forward this knowledge That body is itself the supposed cause or one of the supposed causes of the abuses in question and cannot be expected and ought not to be asked to give evidence against itself The enquiry therefore which is of necessity the first step in the business cannot be entrusted to Parliament but must be undertaken by a distinct body of men separated from every suspicion of corruption or in∣fluence  Instead then of referring to rotten Boroughs and absurd Corporations for Addresses or hawking them about the country to be signed by a few de∣pendant  enants the real and effectual mode would be to come at once to the point and to ascertain the sense of the nation by electing a National Con∣vention By this method as already observed the general WILL whether to reform or not or what the reform shall be or how far it shall extend will be known and it cannot be known by any other means Such a body empowered and supported by the nation will have authority to demand in∣formation upon all matters necessary to be enquired into and no Minister nor any other person will dare to refuse it It will then be seen whether se∣ventern millions of taxes are necessary and for what purposes they are expended The concealed Pen∣sioners will then be obliged to unmask and the source of influence and corruption if any such there be will be laid open to the nation not for the pur∣pose of revenge but of redress  By taking this public and national ground all objections against partial Addresses on one side or private associations on the other will be done away THE NATION WILL DECREE ITS OWN REFORMS and the clamour about Party and Faction or Ins or Outs will become ridiculous  The plan and organization of a Convention is easy in practice  In the first place the number of inhabitants in every county can be sufficiently enough known from the number of houses assessed to the House and Windowlight tax in each county This will give the rule for apportioning the number of Mem∣bers to be elected to the National Convention in each of the counties  If the total number of inhabitants in England be seven millions and the total number of Members to be elected to the Convention be one thousand the number of Members to be elected in a county containing one hundred and fifty thousand inha∣bitants will be  twentyone  and in like proportion for any other county  As the election of a Convention must in order to ascertain the general sense of the nation go on grounds different from that of Parliamentary elec∣tions the mode that best promises this end will have no difficulties to combat with from absurd customs and pretended rights The right of every man will be the same whether he lives in a city a town or a village The custom of attaching Rights to  place  or in other words to inanimate matter instead of to the  person  independently of place is too absurd to make any part of a rational argument  As every man in the nation of the age of twentyone years pays taxes either out of the property he pos∣sesses or out of the product of his labour which is property to him and is amenable in his own per∣son to every law of the land so has every one the  same equal right to vote and no one part of a na∣tion nor any individual has a right to dispute the right of another The man who should do this ought to forfeit the exercise of his  own  right for a term of years This would render the punishment consistent with the crime  When a qualification to vote is regulated by years it is placed on the firmest possible ground because the qualification is such as nothing but dy∣ing before the time can take away and the equa∣lity of Rights as a principle is recognized in the act of regulating the exercise But when Rights are placed upon or made dependant upon pro∣perty they are on the most precarious of all tenures "Riches make themselves wings and fly away" and the rights fly with them and thus they be∣come lost to the man when they would be of most value  It is from a strange mixture of tyranny and cowar∣dice that exclusions have been set up and conti∣nued The boldness to do wrong at first changes afterwards into cowardly craft and at last into fear The Representatives in England appear now to act as if they were afraid to do right even in part lest it should awaken the nation to a sense of all the wrongs it has endured This case serves to shew that the same conduct that best constitutes the safety of an individual namely a strict adherence to prin∣ciple constitutes also the safety of a Government and that without it safety is but an empty name  When the rich plunder the poor of his rights it becomes an example to the poor to plunder the rich of his property for the rights of the one are as much property to him as wealth is property to the other and the  little all  is as dear as the  much  It is only by setting out on just principles that men are trained to be just to each other and it will always be found that when the rich protect the rights of the poor the poor will protect the property of the rich But the gaurantee to be effectual must be parliamentarily reciprocal  Exclusions are not only unjust but they fre∣quently operate as injuriously to the party who mo∣nopolizes as to those who are excluded When men seek to exclude others from participating in the exercise of any right they should at least be assured that thay can effectually perform the whole of the business they undertake for unless they do this themselves will be losers by the monopoly This has been the case with respect to the monopo∣lized right of Election The monopolizing party has not been able to keep the Parliamentary Re∣presentation to whom the power of taxation was entrusted in the state it ought to have been and have thereby multiplied taxes upon themselves equally with those who were excluded  A great deal has been and will continue to be said about disqualifications arising from the com∣mission of offences but were this subject urged to its full extent it would disqualify a great number of the present Electors together with their Represen∣tatives  for of all offences none are more destruc∣tive to the morals of Society than Bribery and Cor∣ruption It is therefore civility to such persons to pass this subject over and to give them a fair opportunity of recovering or rather of creating character  Every thing in the present mode of electioneer∣ing in England is the reverse of what it ought to he and the vulgarity that attends elections is no o  er than the natural consequence of inverting the order of the system  In the first place the Candidate seeks the Elec∣tor instead of the Elector seeking for a Representa∣tive and the Electors are advertized as being in the interest of the Candidate instead of the Candi∣date being in the interest of the Electors The Candidate pays the Elector for his vote instead of the Nation paying the Representative for his time and attendance on public business The complaint for an undue election is brought by the Candidate as if he and not the Electors were the party ag∣grieved and he takes on himself at any period of the elector to break it up by declining as if the election was in his right and not in theirs  The compact that was entered into at the last Westminster election between two of the Candidates Mr Fox and Lord Hood was an indecent viola∣tion of the principles of election The Candidates assumed in their own persons the rights of the Electors for it was only in the body of the Elec∣tors  and not at all in the Candidates that the right of making any such compact or compromise could exist But the principle of Election and Represen∣tation is so compleatly done away in every stage thereof that inconsistency has no long  r the power of surprising  Neither from elections thus conducted nor from rotten Borough Addressers nor from Countymeetings promoted by Placemen and Pensioners can the sense of the nation be known It is still corruption appealing to itself But a Convention of a thousand persons fairly elected would bring every matter to a decided issue  As to Countymeetings it is only persons of lei∣sure or those who live near to the place of meeting that can attend and the number on such occasions is but like a drop in the bucket compared with the whole The only consistent service which such meetings could render would be that of apportion∣ing the county into convenient districts and when this is done each district might according to its number of inhabitants elect its quota of County Members to the National Convention and the vote of each Elector might be taken in the parish where he resided either by ballot or by voice as he should chuse to give it  A National Convention thus formed would bring together the sense and opinions of every part of the nation fairly taken The science of Government and the interest of the Public and of the several  parts thereof would then undergo an ample and rational discussion freed from the language of par∣liamentary disguise  But in all deliberations of this kind though men have a right to reason with and endeavour to con∣vince each other upon any matter that respects their common good yet in point of practice the majority of opinions when known forms a rule for the whole and to this rule every good citizen prac∣tically conforms  Mr Burke as if he knew for every concealed Pensioner has the opportunity of knowing that the abuses acted under the present system are two fla∣grant to be palliated and that the majority of opi∣nions whenever such abuses should be made pub∣lic would be for a general and effectual reform has endeavoured to preclude the event by sturdily denying the right of a majority of a nation to act as a whole Let us bestow a thought upon this case  When any matter is proposed as a subject for consultation it necessarily implies some mode of decision Common consent arising from absolute necessity has placed this in a majority of opinions because without it there can be no decision and consequently no order It is perhaps the only case in which mankind however various in their ideas upon other matters can consistently be unanimous because it is a mode of decision derived from the  primary original right of every individual concern∣ed  that  right being first individually excercised in giving an opinion and whether that opinion shall arrange with the minority or the majority is a sub∣sequent accidental thing that neither increases nor diminishes the individual original right itself Prior to any debate enquiry or vestigation it is not sup∣posed to be known on which side the majority of opinions will fall and therefore whilst this mode of decision secures to every one the right of giving an opinion it admits to every one an equal chance in the ultimate event  Among the matters that will present themselves to the consideration of a National Convention there is one wholly of a domestic nature but so marvelously loaded with confusion as to appear at first sight almost impossible to be reformed I mean the condition of what is called Law  But if we examine into the cause from whence this confusion now so much the subject of univer∣sal complaint is produced not only the remedy will immediately present itself but with it the means of preventing the like case hereafter  In the first place the confusion has generated it∣self from the absurdity of every Parliament assum∣ing to be eternal in power and the laws partake in a similiar manner of this assumption They have no period of legal or natural expiration and however absurd in principle or inconsistent in practice many of them have become they still are if not espe∣cially  repealed considered as making a part of the general mass By this means the body of what is called Law is spread over a space of  several hun∣dred years  comprehending laws obsolete laws re∣pugnant laws ridiculous and every other kind of laws forgotten or remembered and what renders the case still worse is that the confusion multiplies with the progress of time  In the time of Henry the Fourth a law was passed mak∣ing it felony  to multiply gold or silver or to make use of the crust or multiplication  and this law remained two hundred and eightysix years upon the statute books It was then re∣peated as being ridiculous and injurious  To bring this misshapen monster into form and to prevent its lapsing again into a wilderness state only two things and those very simple are ne∣cessary  The first is to review the whole mass of laws and to bring forward such only as are worth retaining and let all the rest drop and to give to the laws so brought forward a new era commencing from the time of such reform  Secondly that at the expiration of every twentyone years or any other stated period a like review shall again be taken and the laws found proper to be retained be again carried forward commencing with that date and the useless laws dropt and discon∣tinued By this means there can be no obsolete laws and scarcely such a thing as laws standing in direct or equivocal contradiction to each other and  every person will know the period of time to which he is to look back for all the laws in being  It is worth remarking that whilst every other branch of science is brought within some commo∣dious system and the study of it simplified by easy methods the laws take the contrary course and be∣come every year more complicated entangled con∣fused and obscure  Among the paragraphs which the Attorney Ge∣neral has taken from the  Rights of Man  and put into his information one is that were I have said  that with respect to regular law there is  scarcely such a thing  As I do not know whether the AttorneyGeneral means to shew this expression to be libellous be∣cause it is TRUE or because it is FALSE I shall make no other reply to him in this place than by remark∣ing that if almanack makers had not been more ju∣dicious than lawmakers the study of almanacks would by this time have become as abstruse as the study of law and we should hear of a library of al∣manacks as we now do of statutes but by the sim∣ple operation of letting the obsolete matter drop and carrying forward that only which is proper to be retained all that is necessary to be known is found within the space of a year and laws also ad∣mit of being kept within some given period  I shall here close this letter so far as it respects the Addressers the Proclamation and the Prosecu∣tion and shall offer a few observations to the  Society stiling itself  THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE  That the science of government is beginning to be better understood than in former times and that the age of fiction and political superstition and of craft and mystery is passing away are matters which the experience of every day proves to be true as well in England as in other countries  As therefore it is impossible to calculate the silent progress of opinion and also impossible to govern a nation after it has changed its habits of thinking by the craft or policy that it was governed by be∣fore the only true method to prevent popular dis∣contents and commotions is to throw by every fair and rational argument all the light upon the subject that can possibly be thrown and at the same time to open the means of collecting the general sense of the nation and this cannot as already observed be done by any plan so effectually as a National Con∣vention Here individual opinion will quiet itself by having a centre to rest upon  The society already mentioned which is made up of men of various descriptions but chiefly of those called Foxites appears to me either to have taken wrong grounds from want of judgment or to have acted with cunning reserve It is now amusing the people with a new phrase namely that of  a tempe∣rate and moderate reform  the interpretation of which is  a continuance of the abuses as long as possible If we cannot hold all lot us hold some  Who are those that are frightened at reforms Are the public afraid that their taxes should be les∣sened too much Are they afraid that sinecure places and pensions should be abolished too fast Are the poor afraid that their condition should be rendered too comfortable Is the wornout mechanic or the aged and decayed tradesman frightened at the pro∣spect of receiving ten pounds a year out of the sur∣plus taxes Is the soldier frightened at the thoughts of his discharge and three shillings per week during life Is the sailor afraid that presswarrants will be abolished The Society mistakes the fears of bo∣roughmongers placemen and pensioners for the fears of the people and the  temperate and moderate Reform  it talks of is calculated to suit the condition of the former  Those words "temperate and moderate" are words either of political cowardice or of cunning or seductionA thing moderately good is not so good as it ought to be Moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is a species of vice But who is to be the judge of what is a temperate and moderate Reform The Society is the representative of nobody neither can the un∣represented part of the nation commit this power to those in Parliament in whose election they had no choice and therefore even upon the ground the Society has taken recourse must be had to a Na∣tional Convention  The objection which Mr Fox made to Mr Grey's proposed Motion for a Parliamentary Reform was that it contained no planIt certainly did not But the plan very easily presents itself and whilst it is fair for all parties it prevents the dangers that might otherwise arise from private or popular dis∣content  THOMAS PAINE
