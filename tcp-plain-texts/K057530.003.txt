 THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  VOL III  THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  'TIS SO PAT TO ALL THE TRIBE EACH SWEARS THAT WAS LEVELLED AT ME  GAY  VOLUME III  LONDON  PRINTED FOR SHEPPERSON AND REYNOLDS NO OXFORDSTREET  THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  CHAP I GLOOMY THOUGHTS FILIAL EMOTIONS A JOURNEY TO THE COUNTRY A LAWYER'S ACCOUNTS NOT EASILY CLOSED CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLES THE LEGACY RECEIVED AND DIVIDED RETURN TO OXFORD MORE DISAPPOINTMENT TREACHERY SUSPECTED ARRIVAL AT LONDON DIFFICULTY IN CHOOSING A PROFESSION  MY agitation of mind was too violent to be quickly appeased it did not end with the day or with the week but on the contrary excited interrogatories that prolonged the paroxysm Why was I disturbed Why angry with myself  Why did I accuse Olivia of being severe or what did the accusation mean What were my views From the tumultuous state of my emotions I could not disguise to myself that I had an affection for her but had she ever intimated an affection for me Was the passion that devoured me rational She was of a wealthy family of the provision her father had made for her I was ignorant but I knew that her expectations from the aunt said to be now dying and from others of her kindred were great Was I prepared to accept favours make myself a dependent and be subservient to the unfeeling caprice of Hector or any other proud and ignorant relation Did not such people esteem wealth as the test and the measure of worth What counterpoise had I but sanguine hopes of the probable fallacy of which I had already received strong proofs and which did not in the pictures that fancy at present drew burst upon me with those bright  and vivid flashes that had lately made them so alluring My passions and propensities all led me to seek the power of conferring benefits controlling folly and of being the champion of merit and the rewarder of virtue Ought I not either to renounce Olivia or to render myself in every respect her equal and to disdain the degrading insolence with which any pretensions of mine would otherwise be received Had I no reason to fear that Olivia herself was a little influenced by personal considerations Would she have been quite so ready to disapprove had the advantages of fortune been on my side Was this inferiority entirely disregarded by her The doubt was grating but pertinaciously intrusive Would not any proposal from me be treated with the most sovereign contempt if not by her by Hector and her other relations Why then did I think of her It was but a very few days since the wealth and power that should have raised me  far above the sphere of the Mowbray family were supposed to be within my grasp How painful was the distance at which they now appeared My present debility was felt with intolerable impatience To love and to be unable to heap happiness on the object beloved was a thought that assailed me with excruciating sensations  At this very period another event happened that did not contribute to enliven the prospect  I had lately received intelligence from my mother the tenor of which was that she dreaded the approach of poverty and about a fortnight after the departure of Olivia a letter came by which I learned that lawyer Thornby had refused all further supplies affirming that my grandfather's effects were entirely exhausted except the thousand pounds left by the rector at my own disposal Of this I had already received fifty pounds and my mother urgently declared  in her letter that if I did not apply part of the remainder for her support she should be left in the decline of life the approach of which she was now very ready to acknowledge in imminent danger of want nay so as perhaps even to come upon the parish My pride revolted at the very thought and I was angry with her for having conceived or committed it to paper  Should I suffer my mother to want No To become a pauper My heart spurned at the base suggestion I had been several years under the tuition of the rector and had acquired more than was good of his family dignity The picture before me was not a pleasing one but I would subject myself to any hardships ay would starve on a grain a day rather than abandon my mother My motives were mixed some wrong some right  This affair made me resolve once more to visit my native country and my resolution  was immediately put in practice It was a relief though of a painful kind to the more painful state in which my undecided thoughts at that moment held me The man whose contradictory impulses goad him in a thousand different directions without permitting him to pursue any one is happy to be put in motion  My arrival was unexpected my mother who was but little inclined to accuse herself received me with much more satisfaction than embarrassment  The behaviour of Thornby was not quite so selfcomplacent My questions concerning the receipt and disbursement of my grandfather's property were sometimes answered with the affectation of open honesty and at others with petulant ambiguity so that I knew not whether he meant to shun or to provoke inquiry  Executorship was a very thankless office it involved a man in continual trouble for which he could receive  no recompence and then subjected him to the suspicions of people who were unable or unwilling to look after their own affairs His very great friendship for the rector had induced him to take this office upon himself though he well knew the trouble and tediousness attending it and the ingratitude with which it was always repaid He had several times in his life played the fool in the same way and had always met with the same reward  Equivocation is the essence of law and I believe he spoke truth  He should take care however not to involve himself in such officious troubles for the future As for the accounts he was ready at all times and desirous to have them settled He had been plagued enough and had even paid money out of his own pocket which he was sure whenever a balance came to be struck he should not be reimbursed But there were various  affairs that he could not immediately close law accounts bad debts mortgages and other matters that required time He had business of his own to which he must attend or be ruined his clients would have good actions against him if it could be proved that their suits were lost by his neglect Indeed he was not bound to give me any account but he always acted on the square and therefore defied scrutiny nay he wished it for what had an honest man to fear  He talked so much of his honesty that if he did not quite persuade me it was immaculate he at least led me to doubt  Beside as he had reminded me what claims had I The property was bequeathed to my mother she had married her husband had squandered it away and there was an end of it Farther inquiry was but vexation and loss of time It is true the supposed wealth of the  rector had quickly disappeared but if the owner of it my mother's husband were satisfied what could be said  She indeed hinted to me that Wakefield finding he could wrest no more from his uncle unless by filing a bill in Chancery or some other process at law for which he had no funds not to mention the great chance of his being cast in costs of suit had been obliged to desist though convinced that the property was not one half expended He had a better hope Thornby was old had no children and might soon leave him the whole  With most men this would have been a powerful motive but the passions of her young husband my mother owned were too impetuous to be restrained by the cold considerations of prudence At first she censured him with reluctance for to censure him was in reality to adduce mementos of her own folly but her resentment against him for having deserted her presently  overpowered her caution and the pictures she drew shewed him to be not only dissipated and prodigal but unprincipled He had even so far offended the law that it was doubtful whether his life were not in danger and Thornby whose plans had been frustrated by his extravagance had more ways than one of ridding himself of his importunity  In any case it was necessary to make some provision for my mother and embroiled in doubt as I was the most prudent way that I could imagine was to consult Thornby  He affected to be very conscientious and scarcely knew what advice to give  My mother was in want and to desert her would be cruel yet the money that was devised me was my own it was bequeathed for a good purpose and the pious will of the testator ought to be held sacred I was young the grandson of a good man an excellent man and his dear friend I had great  learning and good sense and ought not to be deprived of the means that had been left me of establishing myself in life But then my mother had been tenderly brought up and a dutiful son to be sure could not desert his parent It was a difficult point To purchase a life annuity for her would be the best way of securing her against the miseries of poverty in old age but then it would sink deeply into the thousand pounds to make but a very moderate provision of this kind though he knew no other method in her case that would be so safe  While I listened I resolved To provide for my mother I held to be an indispensable duty and notwithstanding my late disappointments my fears for myself were but few People of a sanguine temper are subject to temporary doubt and gloom but the sky soon clears and though one bright star may shoot and fall hope soon creates a whole  constellation The earl and the prelate had both been uprincipled but the failure was in them not in me I could not but remember the terror that Themistocles had excited in a prime minister and the avidity with which a prelate had endeavoured to profit by my theological talents How certainly and how soon could I bring these talents into notice How easy the task I need but mount the rostrum I need but put pen to paper and my adversaries would be brought to shame and mankind taught to do me justice Incontrovertible facts were in my favour and to foster doubts and fears would be cowardice selfdesertion and folly Such were my conclusions  I determined therefore without farther hesitation to employ the sum of five hundred pounds in the purchase of an annuity for my mother The remainder would amply supply me till those rich mines should be explored from the fertile  veins of which I had already drawn such dazzling specimens  I continued in the country almost three weeks but as the purchase could not instantly be concluded I left the stipulated sum in my mother's possession drew the remainder of the thousand pounds in bills and cash from Thornby and with more wealth than I ever bore about me at one time before returned to Oxford  Though Olivia was daily and hourly remembered I had recovered so far by the business in which I had been engaged as to think seriously of pursuing my studies for by their aid I was to realize those splendid projects on which as I supposed the happiness of man depends  The learning which the general forms of taking a degree require is so little that a man of genius is inclined to treat it with contempt but if the candidate happen to be obnoxious to the heads of the university his examination may then  be of a very different kind I had not much doubt for from the questions and answers I had so often heard on these occasions to reject me seemed to be almost impossible Yet I was not entirely without alarm The disgrace of rustication that I had suffered the coldness of the reception I had met from the president on my return to college and the ambiguity which I conceived I had since remarked in his manner excited some fear and my preparatory efforts were so strenuous that I imagined I might defy reproof  I had been told indeed that malice had a very strange mode of exerting itself but which was so arbitrary and odious as to be but rarely practised Any member of convocation or master of arts without assigning any cause for his conduct may object for two terms to a person who shall ask leave to take his degree Nay these terms ended another may object and another But this was  a privilege so disgusting that I had not the least apprehension it would be put in practice against me  To my utter astonishment I was mistaken On the day appointed to ask leave a master of arts actually did appear and without supporting his objection by reasoning charge or censure exercised this detestable university veto  My surprize and indignation at hearing him pronounce his negative were so great that I was deprived of utterance I even doubted the reality of what I heard I stood gazing till he was gone and then exclaimed as if to a person present"Me Sir Do you mean me"  A minute afterward my interjections were not quite so inoffensive A torrent of passion burst from me and he whose malignity could not justly assert I wanted learning might had he stayed have collected sufficient proofs of my want of philosophy  My attention had been diverted from the accuser by my amazement at the accusation but as soon as I recovered my recollection it seemed to me certain that I knew his face The idea was seized with so much eagerness and associations occurred so rapidly that the figure of one of my companions on the night of the debauch when I first came to Oxford rose full before me though he had been absent from the university so that till this day I had never seen him since It was the very tutor of the Earl of Idford  A train of the most tormenting suspicions rushed upon me I soon learned from inquiry that he was intimate likewise with the president Was not this a combination What could it be else This tutor was connected with the earl and the president so was the latter with the bishop  The whole plot in its blackest hues seemed developed  My agitation was extreme I ran from college to college wherever I had acquaintance repeating all I knew and much of what I suspected Nor did I merely confine myself to narrative I added threats which however impotent they might be were not the less violent One of my first projects was to seek personal satisfaction of the vile tutor or if he refused to chastise him with inexorable severity but this he had taken care to elude by keeping out of the way  My denunciations soon reached the ear of the president and I was given to understand that if I were not immediately silent I should be expelled the university and that a degree would never be granted me till I had publicly retracted the opprobious words I had uttered Distant consequences are easily defied My blood was in a flame and despising the menace I publicly declared that my persecutors were as infamous as the tool they had employed that I  should think it a disgrace to be a member of a body which could countenance proceedings so odiously wicked that I spurned at every honour such a body could confer and that with respect to expulsion I would myself erase my name from the register in which it had unfortunately been entered  How little is man aware that by intemperance he damns his own cause and gives the face of seeming honesty to injustice itself Vicious as the place is I myself could not abhor such proceedings more than many men in Oxford would have done had they believed the tale  Fortune still continued in her wayward mood On the heel of one perverse imp another often treads While I remained at Oxford which was but a few days after this event the retailing of my wrongs was my chief employment and in a coffeeroom to which I resorted for this purpose the following advertisement  in a London newspaper met my astonished eye  THIS DAY IS PUBLISHED A DEFENCE OF THE THIRTY NINE ARTICLES BY THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD ****** LORD BISHOP OF * * * * *  Injustice had by this time become so familiar to me that scourged even to frenzy as I was I sat rather stunned than transfixed by the blow That this was the very defence of the articles I had written did not with me admit of a moment's doubt Every thing I had heard or remarked of this wicked but weak church governor had afforded proof of his incapacity for such a task yet the injustice effrontery and vice of the act was what till seen could not have been believed  Nor did its baseness end here What could I suppose but that the bishop had been assiduously tampering with the  president that they and the earl were in a conspiracy against me that this was the cause of the disgrace and insult put upon me and that having robbed me of my writings there was a concerted and fixed plan to render me contemptible take away my character and devote me to ruin  The longer I thought the more painful were the sensations that assaulted me I had already been complaining to the whole city Some few indeed seemed to credit me but more to suspect and none heard of my treatment with that glowing detestation which my feelings required Were I to tell this new tale incredibly atrocious as it was what would men think but that I was a general calumniator a frantic egotist and a man dangerous to society The total inability that I felt in myself to obtain ample and immediate justice almost drove me mad  I had previously determined to quit  Oxford and this new goad did but quicken my departure My preparations were soon made and from some vague and to myself undefined ideas partly of expedition and partly of letting the president the college and the whole university see that I Hugh Trevor was no ordinary person a chaise and four waited my commands at the gate about noon the next day behind which my goods and chattels were buckled and I after taking leave of the two or three friends who were thoughtless or courageous enough to acknowledge me threw myself indignantly into it with more maledictions in my heart than my impatient tongue could find energy to utter  Arrived in London it especially became me as I supposed to assume that consequence which should teach my enemies respect I had money in my pocket anger impelling me and more pride than prudence A waiter was dispatched  patched from the Gloucester coffeehouse and apartments for myself and a valet were hired in Half Moon Street at three guineas and a half per week The valet was a sudden decision originating in the same false feelings that had lately taken possession of me When I consulted the mistress of the coffeehouse concerning apartments she said "you have a servant to be sure Sir" 'Yes madam' replied my alarmed vanity 'No madam' instantly retorted my veracity still more alarmed 'but I mean to hire one' "There" continued she pointing to a smart well powdered young fellow that was talking to one of the waiters "there stands one out of place who I dare say will be glad of a good master Here Philip"  I was one of the fools who right or wrong imagine it behooves them to be consistent I was ashamed to retract had not learned to prevaricate and  Philip to whom as a footman I could discover no rational objection was hired  My effects were presently removed my useless valet sent to loiter and improve himself in vice as valets usually are and I left to meditate on the plan I had to pursue  A little reflection induced me to renounce all thoughts of the church for which indeed the doubts that the conversation of Turl had inspired me with the inquiries to which these doubts led and the disgust I had conceived at the character and conduct of the bishop had well prepared me  For some time I sat perplexed in thought During the life of the rector I had often been told that the law was the road to honour and when at the university being eager to secure this said honour to myself I had laboriously read some of the civilians I say laboriously for the task was far from  inviting The obscurity of their terms the contradictions I thought I discovered and the voluminous perplexity in which the whole was involved were no alluring pictures  With what pleasure did the wearied intellect escape from this wilderness of weeds and brambles to rove through the paradise of poetry The minstrelsy of genius sporting with the fancy rouzing the passions and unfolding the secrets of the heart could fascinate at all times while nothing could sooner create lassitude and repugnance than the incongruous jargon of law  But alas who ever heard of a poet being made Lord High Chancellor Appoint him to such a station and he would act like a madman Instead of employing his journeymen to dig through the rubbish of ignorance for precedents he would listen to the wants of the injured and would conceive that by relieving them only he could do justice Did not  the history of the world proclaim that he who would attain wealth and power must turn the prejudices of mankind to their own harm  CHAP II THE PLAYHOUSE AND AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE SATIRICAL PORTRAITS RECEPTION OF A NEW COMEDY OR OF HOW MUCH WORTH ARE PRAISE AND BLAME  THESE were painful reflections and leaving the case undetermined for the present I escaped from them by shifting the scene to the playhouse It happened to be the first night of a new comedy and here in the boxes I perceived an acquaintance whom I had met at the house of Ellis His name was Glibly and the moment he saw me enter he advanced and accosted me with that familiarity which was essential to his character  Glad of company in a city where I was so little known I freely entered into conversation with him and the amusement he afforded me well repaid my complaisance He had long been what is called upon the town and was acquainted more or less with all orders of men He was intimate with authors actors and artists of every kind and degree knew their private and public history could give anecdotes of each and enumerate their various performances Opera girls and their keepers musicians and musical dilletanti connoiseurs and their jackalls picture dealers and auctioneers collectors shell fossil and fiddle fanciers in short every class of idlers that I have since found swarming in this miscellaneous town ranked among his acquaintance  He had long as I afterward discovered been a newspaper critic had written prologues appeared in poet's corner abounded in sarcastic remarks and possessed an Athenian loquacity He had  indeed a copious vocabulary an uncommon aptitude of phrase though not free from affectation and a tide of tongue that was incessant  He probably thought my personal appearance creditable for he did not quit me during the performance but amused me with the satirical portraits of various people whom he pointed out to me in the house  'Do you see that man' said he 'who is just entering three boxes distant on the right He is handing two ladies to their seats and is followed by a youngster who is all pertness and powder They make a great shew and on a first night give an appearance of good company That is Mynheer van Hopmeister a Dutch dancingmaster with his daughter son and a kept mistress They live all together on very good terms and his own girl has preserved her character by her ugliness affectation and ill breeding He drives about in  his chariot which passing in the street you would suppose belonged to a Neapolitan Count or a German Envoy at least He gives dinners occasionally of several removes to which he invites all the fools and fiddlers he can find treats with French wines and usually makes up a quartet party for the evening which he spoils by playing a principal part himself He is nearly two thousand pounds in debt and in all things mimicking the great has been obliged to put his affairs to nurse Except the booby his son he is the most prating forward ignorant coxcomb of my acquaintance and that is a bold word But his impertinence makes him amusing I will introduce you'  I thanked my gentleman for his politeness but declined the offer and he continued  'Look at that man in brown leaning against the pillar He is a painter and  a man of genius but the greatest ass existing'  'How Of genius and'  'Hear and judge for yourself No man has studied his art with so much assiduity and zeal or practised it with greater enthusiasm but instead of confining himself to portraitpainting by which with half the labour and one tenth of the talent he might have made a fortune he devoted all his youth to poverty and starving and undertook a series of paintings that would have immortalized a man under the patronage of Leo X This task he was years in accomplishing living all the while on little better than bread and water and that procured by robbing his nights of the hours of rest for his pride which he calls independence is as great as his ambition which he dignifies with the title of a love of fame But the most prominent trait in his character is a jealous'  Here my commentator suddenly interrupting himself pressed my arm and bade me turn to the left  'There' said he pointing 'is a Mr Migrate a famous clerical character and as strange an original as any this metropolis affords He is not entitled to make a figure in the world either by his riches rank or understanding but with an effrontery peculiar to himself he will knock at any man's door though a perfect stranger ask him questions give him advice and tell him he will call again to give him more the first opportunity By this means he is acquainted with every body but knows nobody is always talking yet never says any thing is perpetually putting some absurd interrogation but before it is possible he should understand the answer puts another His desire to be informed torments himself and every man of his acquaintance which is almost every man he meets yet though he lives inquiring  he will die consummately ignorant His brain is a kind of rag shop receiving and returning nothing but rubbish It is as difficult to affront as to get rid of him and though you fairly bid him begone today he will knock at your door march into your house and if possible keep you answering his unconnected fifty times answered queries tomorrow He is the friend and the enemy of all theories and of all parties and tortures you to decide for him which he ought to chuse As far as he can be said to have opinions they are crude and contradictory in the extreme so that in the same breath he will defend and oppose the same system With all this confusion of intellect there is no man so wise but he will prescribe to him how he ought to act and even send him written rules for his conduct He has been a great traveller and continually abuses his own countrymen for not adopting the manners and policy of  the most ignorant depraved and barbarous nations of Europe and Africa He pretends to be the universal friend of man a philanthropist on the largest scale yet is so selfish that he would willingly see the world perish if he could but secure paradise to himself Indeed he can think of no other being and his child his canary bird his cookmaid or his cat are the most extraordinary of God's creatures This is the only consistent trait in his character In the same sentence he frequently joins the most fulsome flattery and some insidious question that asks the person whom he addresses if he do not confess himself to be both knave and fool Delicacy of sentiment is one of his pretensions though his tongue is licentious his language coarse and he is occasionally seized with fits of the most vulgar abuse He declaims against dissimulation yet will smilingly accost the man whom "Ha Migrate How do you do Give me leave to introduce you to Mr  Trevor a friend of mine a gentleman and a scholar just come from Oxford Your range of knowledge and universal intimacy with men and things may be useful to him and his erudite acquisitions and philosophical research will be highly gratifying to an inquirer like you An intercourse between you must be mutually pleasing and beneficial and I am happy to bring you acquainted"  This addressed to the man whom he had been satirizing so unsparingly was inconceivable The unabashed facility with which he veered from calumny to compliment the very moment too after he had accused the man whom he accosted of dissimulation struck me dumb I had perhaps seen something like it before but nothing half so perfect in its kind It doubly increased my stock of knowledge it afforded a new instance of what the world is and a new incitement to ask how it became so The inquiry at first was painful and  half convinced me of the truth of manicheism but deeper research taught me that the errors of man do not originate in the perversity of his nature but of his ignorance  These however were most of them after thoughts for Glibly did not allow us any long pause  'Yonder in the green boxes' said he 'I perceive Mrs Fishwife the actress She should have played in the comedy we are come to see but threw up her part from scruples of conscience It was not sufficiently refined for her exquisite sensibility it wounded her feelings offended her morals and outraged her modesty Yet in the Greenroom she is never happy unless when the men are relating some lewd tale or repeating obscene jests at every one of which she bursts into a horse laugh and exclaims "Oh you devil But I don't hear you I don't understand a word you say"  To heighten the jest her amours are as public as the ladies on Harris's List'  'But perhaps there is something violently offensive and immoral in the part she refused'  'Not a syllable The writer is too dull even for a  double entendre  as you will hear Mere pretence The author who happens by some odd accident to have more honesty than wit and could not in conscience comply with the present vicious mode of bestowing indiscriminate praise on actors when no small mixture of blame had been merited by many of them forbore to write a preface to his last piece from which she had thought herself secure of a large dose of flattery This is an offence she can never pardon'  'I have heard said Migrate that our actresses are become exceedingly squeamish'  'Oh ridiculous beyond belief I have a letter in my pocket from a young  friend in a country company the ladies of which have their sensibility strung up to so fine a tone that he cannot take the tragedy of King Lear for his benefit because not one of them will play either Regan or Goneril If their feelings are so exquisite in the country where our wise laws treat players as vagabonds what must they be when loaded with all the legal tragic and royal dignity of a London theatre'  This was so incredible that I expressed my doubts of the fact but they were ill founded for Glibly produced the letter  A moment afterward two more of his acquaintance caught his eye  'Look to the right' said he 'the box next the gallery There they sit Mr and Mrs WhiffleWit They are now in state They have really a capacious appearance Were Rubens or Jordaens but here we should have them painted in all the riches of oil colours  grinning in company with Silenus and his ass Let the poor author beware they are prodigious critics Madam can write a farce or even a solution to an enigma with as little labour as any lady in the land and her dear Mr WhiffleWit can set them both to music with no less facility and genius Nothing can equal them except his own jigs on the organ They never fail to attend the first night of a new play and their taste is so very refined that nothing less than writing it themselves could afford them satisfaction They never admire any nonsense but their own The manager and author have always to thank them for exerting their whole stock of little wit and abundant envy to put the house into an ill temper The favour is the more conspicuous because they are  orderly people  But that perhaps is a phrase you do not understand Mr Trevor They never pay for their places yet always occupy a first row for themselves and in  general the rest of the box for their friends who they take good care shall be as well disposed toward the house and the author as they are You may be sure to meet them tomorrow very industriously knocking at every door where they can gain admission to tell their acquaintance what a vile piece it was and what a strange blockhead the manager must be who had refused farces of their writing and operas of their setting yet could dare to insult the town with such trash They have now continued for years in this state of surprise and there is no knowing when it will end'  The satire of Glibly was incessant till the tinkling of the prompter's bell and the rising of the curtain put an end to his remarks on persons and turned them all on the piece I cannot but own the author opened an ample field for the effluvia of critic gall I know not whether Glibly might influence the tone of my mind but I think I never felt such  ineffable contempt for any human production as for the thing called a comedy which I that night saw Disjointed dialogue no attempt at plan or fable each scene a different story and each story improbable and absurd quibbles without meaning puns without point cant without character sentiments as dull as they were false and a continual outrage on manners morals and common sense were its leading features Yet strange to tell the audience endured it all and by copious retrenchments and plaistering and patching this very piece had what is called a run  How capricious a thing is public taste It can regale on garbage from which Hottentots would turn with loathing and yet in the frenzy of idiotism could reject and condemn Congreve's "Way of the World"  Glibly treated the piece with unceasing contempt yet clapped every scene and when on two or three occasions some  few raised their voices and called  off off  he more loudly than the rest vociferated  Go on go on  When it was over he left me saying it was the most execrable piece he had ever beheld but he had promised to give it a good character in the paper with which he was connected and this he must immediately go and write'  CHAP III REPETITION OF DOUBTS A VERY OLD ACQUAINTANCE ANOTHER PLEASING RENCONTRE PERPLEXITY AND SUSPENSE CREATED  THE adventures of the evening sent me home with no very agreeable reflections What a world was this How replete with folly hypocrisy and vice What certainty had the man of virtue that his claims should be heard Amid the tumultuous pursuits of selfishness where all were eager to gratify their own passions  and appease the capricious cravings of vanity how might truth and worth ascertain success The comedy I had seen had convinced me that farce inanity and supreme nonsense might not only pass current but find partisans yet proofs in abundance were on record that genius itself had no security against faction envy and mistaken opposition I was at present in a state of warfare and were judges like these to give the meed of victory How many creatures had the powerful and the proud obedient to their beck ever ready to affirm deny say and unsay and by falsehood and defamation involve in ruin men whose souls were the most pure and principles the most exalted  For some days I remained in a state of suspense continually determining to seek the satisfaction which I supposed my injuries demanded but undecided with respect to the method  This delay was still prolonged by another  event My man Philip one morning when he brought my breakfast told me that a woman in the house who lived with a young lady on the second floor had asked him various questions concerning me saying she was sure she knew me that she loved me from her soul for that I had once saved the life of her and her dear boy and that she wished very much to see me  At first this account surprised me A woman and a boy whose lives I had saved Where is she said I Below in the kitchen answered Philip I bade him desire her to come up and in a few minutes a woman about the age of forty entered but of whose countenance I had no clear recollection 'I beg pardon Sir' said she 'for my boldness but your name I believe is Mr Trevor'  'It is'  'Mr Hugh Trevor'  'The same'  'God in his mercy bless and keep you  Since the night that you saved my life I never went to bed without praying for you But you were always a kind dear good child and your uncle Mr Elford was the best of men'  The epithet child and the name of Elford instantly solved the riddle it was poor Mary and the boy whose life I had saved was the child of which she was delivered after the adventure of the barn Her features suddenly became as it were familiar to me She revived a long train of ideas inspiring that kind of melancholy pleasure which mind so much delights to encourage I kissed her with sincere good will and in sympathy with my feelings the poor creature yielding to her affections clasped me round the neck pressed me to her cheek exclaimed 'God in heaven for ever bless you' then suddenly recollecting herself with that honest simplicity which was so constitutionally her character dropped on her  knees and added 'I humbly beg pardon Sir for being so bold'  After some persuasion I prevailed on her to sit down but I could not conquer her timidity and imaginary inferiority so far as to induce her to partake of my breakfast 'She knew her duty better I was a gentleman once her dear young master and she should always adore me and act as was befitting a poor servant like her'  We talked over former affairs and she brought many scenes of my early youth strongly to recollection On inquiry she told me she had apprenticed her son to a printer that till this period she had fed clothed and educated him by her own industry and that he was now likely to be no longer burthensome to her being an apt and industrious boy and already capable of supplying himself with clothes by his overwork  I farther learnt from her discourse that she lived with a young lady whom  she affectionately loved and there was something mysterious occasionally in her phrases that led me to imagine her mistress had been unfortunate 'She had been a kind mistress to her she loved her in her heart Poor young lady she did not deserve the mishaps she had met with and it was a shame that some men should be so base as they were but though all the world should turn their back on her she would not be so wicked Poor women were born to be misused by falsehearted men and if they had no pity for one another what must become of them'  I asked if she had lived with the lady long She answered that first and last she had known her ever since she left Mr Elford's service  'What Was she of our county'  'Yea'  'Was I acquainted with her'  Mary hesitated and my curiosity was rouzed'What was the lady's name'  'Miss Lydia Wilmot'  'Wilmot Wilmot Surely not Miss Wilmot the niece of the bishop of *****'  'No no' said Mary 'a's not his niece 'a has better blood in her veins thof mayhap 'a may have had her failings God help us who is without 'em A bishop Lord ha' mercy on us No Christian soul could have believed there was so much wickedness in the world'  My impatience increased and I eagerly demanded'Did she ever live with the bishop'  Poor Mary knew not what to answer I perceived her confusion 'Go Mary' said I 'and tell Miss Wilmot that Mr Trevor presents his compliments to her and will be glad to speak to her the moment she is at leisure'  After a little hesitation Mary went continued up stairs some time and at last returned with'Miss Wilmot's compliments  she should be glad to see me'  I hurried to her apartment My conjectures were too well founded to be false it was the same Miss Wilmot to whom I had been introduced by the bishop the sister of the guide of my studies and the friend of my youth Her embarrassment was considerable she sunk on the sopha as she curtsied pointed to a chair and faintly requested I would sit down  I exerted myself to assume the tone that should tranquilize her feelings and by asking and answering my own questions and endeavouring myself to sustain the conversation brought her with some little difficulty to join in it  I was burning to interrogate her concerning the bishop but was restrained by the fear of wounding her sensibility I inquired after her brother but him I found she had not lately seen I forebore  to be minute but it appeared that they knew not the place of each other's abode I sat with her an hour but notwithstanding my impatience perceiving she evaded the subject I wished to introduce and turned the discourse on the common place occurrences of the day I was too respectful of her delicacy to violate it and left her with an invitation to drink tea  h me the following afternoon which  ccepted  I saw Mary  in the interim had some discourse with her and by several phrases which she once more let fall was involved in greater perplexity A person of my family had  a ruinated  Miss Wilmot of all hope she never could have justice and right done her now that was  unpossable  But mayhap all things  was  for the best The base man had shewn that he was not worth having She was sorry both on her ladyship's account and mine but there was no help  for it God send him a good end but she feared it Such wickedness could never prosper'  This language was totally incomprehensible'A person of my family The base man Sorry on my account' What did she mean  Mary was afraid she had said too much'I dare not tell you dear good Sir' continued she 'only don't you be  cunsarned  it is no blame of yours you will know soon enough'  In this uncertainty she left me impatiently hoping some farther explanation from Miss Wilmot of which I was not disappointed The afternoon came Mary announced her mistress we were left alone and I could no longer forbear expressing my desire of knowing her history  At first she felt some reluctance but when I informed her how much Mary had already told she sighed deeply and  said 'I find Sir it is in vain to think of concealment I will therefore since you desire it relate the few events that are remarkable in my unfortunate life I fear they are more blameable than extraordinary for from what I hear and see in this great city mine are no uncommon misfortunes I even fear I am hitherto less wretched and guilty than thousands God only knows for what I am reserved'  CHAP IV THE STORY OF MISS WILMOT FAMILY MISFORTUNES A FATHER'S DEATH A BROTHER'S DISAPPOINTMENT INTELLIGENCE THAT ASTONISHES ME WAKEFIELD CHARACTERIZED THE DEATH OF MISS WILMOT'S MOTHER AND THE DREAD OF FATAL CONSEQUENCES PIETY AND COMPASSION OF A BISHOP DEEP DESIGNS OF WAKEFIELD THE GOOD FAITH AND AFFECTION OF A POOR ADHERENT  'MY father was an officer in the army in which though he served all his life he only attained the rank of major He was twice married the second time to my mother at the age of thirty by whom he had five children who except my brother and myself did not arrive at maturity Being reduced to the income of halfpay they retired into their native county where they lived with such strict oeconomy that they contrived to educate  us better perhaps than the children of people of much larger fortune  'My brother was the eldest child and I the youngest so that there was an interval of fifteen years between us My father had been well educated loved letters and undertook to be my brother's instructor himself to the age of fourteen At this period my brother was admitted a chorister at the cathedral of at which city my parents had fixed their residence They were respected by all the inhabitants whose wealth birth and pride did not place them at too great a distance and it was a severe mortification to be unable to provide better for their son but there was no remedy  'The disappointments of my father's life had given him a melancholy cast with an aptitude to be dissatisfied and this propensity was strongly communicated to my brother The danger of a war between England and Spain called  my father up to town in the hope of being once more put on actual service But in this his hopes again were frustrated and expence without benefit was incurred Early however in the American war he obtained his wishes unhappily obtained them for having been long unused to the baneful severity of camps he and many more brave men were carried off by the damps of the climate to which he was sent This happened when I was but nine years old and my mother was left with what little their oeconomy had collected and such scanty provision as is made for officers widows  'My brother however who was truly affectionate and active in efforts to protect us afforded my mother some aid From being a chorister he had gained admission into the grammarschool of which while he remained there he was the pride and boast Immediately after our father's death from the recommendation  of his own merit and the misfortunes of the family he was appointed a Latin usher in the same school in which station he remained five years The difference of our age made him consider himself something rather like a father than a brother to me he loved me tenderly took every method to improve and provide for me and expected in return something like parental obedience The manners of my mother were of the mild and pleasing kind with which qualities she endeavoured to familiarize me and the behaviour of the whole fafamily gained general approbation and esteem  'My brother was deeply smitten with the love of letters his poetical essays were numerous many of them were sent up to London and readily admitted into periodical publications  'Anxious to place his family in that rank which he had been taught to suppose it deserved for my father and mother  were both though not noble well born he did not rest satisfied with these attempts he wrote a tragedy and by the advice of people who pretended to have a knowledge of such affairs determined to go to London that he might if possible get it on the stage From this my mother would fain have dissuaded him but his arguments and importunity at length prevailed He was then but nine and twenty and I fourteen  'I could ill describe to you the state of anxiety and suspence in which his various literary efforts involved him while he remained in London but in about two years he returned to the country despairing of that pleasure profit and fame which hope had delusively taught him to consider as his due This was the period at which he once more became an usher of the school where you were educated This too was the period at which my misfortunes began  'And now Mr Trevor I am coming to events in which you without any knowledge or interference of your own may be said to be a partaker'  She paused a moment and I with amazement doubt and increasing ardour requested she would proceed  'The name of Wakefield must certainly be familiar to you'  'It is I am sorry to say it is the name my mother at present bears'  'If you feel sorrow Mr Trevor what must my feelings be Mine who had there been truth or honour in man ought to have borne that name myself Mine who when I first heard of your mother's marriage should not have felt so severe a pang had a dagger been struck to my heart Mine who from that moment or rather from the fatal and guilty moment when I confided in an unprincipled man have never known that cheerfulness and peace which once were the inmates of my bosom'  'You astonish me madam Wakefield'  'Wakefield Him have I to thank for loss of selfrespect a brother's love and perhaps a parent's life I was my mother's companion consolation and pride How can I estimate a mother's grief She died within a year Have I not reason to believe her days were shortened by her daughter's guilt'  The pain of recollection was agonizing She burst into a flood of tears nor could every effort she made keep down the deep sobs that for some minutes impeded speech I used every endeavour to appease and calm her mind she seemed sensibly touched by that sympathy which intensely pervaded me and as soon as she could recover herself thus continued  'The kind part you take in my affliction Mr Trevor affords me greater relief than any that perhaps I have felt for years It is true the faithful Mary  good creature has almost shed tear for tear but she herself is the daughter of misfortune and from her though grateful it is something like expected You are a man you perhaps have been accustomed to the society of those whose pleasure is the most exquisite when they can most contribute to the miseries of woman that you should be virtuous enough to contemn such instruction does more than sooth feelings like mine and I think we esteem benefits the more the less we expect them'  'But where madam did you first meet with Mr Wakefield '  'In the city of where he was bred under his father to the profession of the law From what I have seen of you and from what I have heard of your talents and understanding I should have expected you to have been the child of extraordinary parents otherwise I do not much wonder at your mother's conduct superior as she was to Mr Wakefield  in years for of all the men I ever saw he is the most deceitful plausible and dangerous Neither man nor woman are safe with him and his arts are such as to overreach the most cautious He has words at will and his wit and invention which are extraordinary are employed to entrap humiliate degrade and ruin all with whom he has intercourse His ambition is to gratify his desires by triumphing over the credulity of the unsuspecting whom he contemns for their want of his own vices It was he that after having seduced me placed me in the family of the bishop laid the plan that I should pass for his lordship's niece by various falsehoods cajoled me to acquiesce the chief of which was that the project was but to save appearances till he could make me his wife left me in that unworthy prelate's power then returning to the country plotted the marriage with your mother and by his intimate knowledge of the weakness or vice  of each character which he seems to catch instinctively adapted his scheme with such cunning to the avarice of his uncle as to gain his concurrence and aid  'It was my clandestine departure at this period and the rumours and suspicions to which it gave birth that again drove my brother from the country For some months neither he nor my mother knew what was become of me  'At length her decline and the extreme affliction of dying and never hearing of me more occasioned her to prevail on my brother to advertise me in all the papers This he did by inserting the initials of my name and such other tokens as he knew must be intelligible to me should I read the advertisement informing me at the same time of the dying state of my mother  'His plan so far succeeded as to come to my knowledge I read the paper was seized with horror at the information  and immediately wrote in answer It was too late My mother was dead and I left in that state of distraction to which by a single moment's weakness I had been thus fatally conducted  'Grief despondency and resentment took firm possession of my brother's mind He wrote me a dreadful letter of the state of his feelings and though he forebore explicitly to accuse me of my mother's death I could perceive the thought pervaded his mind After her funeral he came up to London but refused all intercourse with me once excepted A few days only after that on which the bishop introduced you to me he came knocked at the door inquired if I were at home and sent up his name  'Of all the moments of my life that was the most awful A deathlike coldness seized me The sound of my brother's name was horror I know not what I said to the servant but the feelings' of Mr Wilmot were too racking  for delay he was presently before me dressed in deep mourning I motionless and dead he haggard the image of despair so changed in form that but for the sharp and quick sighted suspicions of guilt had I met him I should have passed him without suspecting him to be my brother  'I can tell you but little of what passed His sentences were incoherent but halffinished and bursting with passion that was neither grief nor rage nor reproach nor pardon though a mixture of them all The chief impression that he left upon my mind was that he should soon be freed from the torment of existence not by the course of nature he complained with agony that labour disappointment injustice and contamination itself could not kill him but die he would  'From that day to this I have never seen or heard word of him more The deep despair with which he uttered his  last resolution has kept me in a state of uninterrupted terror I daily read all the papers I can buy or borrow with the excruciating dread every paragraph I come to of catching his name and Oh insufferable horror reading an account of his death  'My state of being seems wholly changed I am no longer the same creature My faculties which formerly compared to those of my brother I thought slow even to stupidity are now awakened to such keenness of discernment that the world is multiplied upon me a million fold Sometimes it is all intelligence though of a dark and terrific hue at other moments objects swarm so thick that they dance confusion and give me a foretaste of madness to which I have now a constant fear that I shall be driven My own deep shame the loss of the man whom like an idiot I dearly loved my mother's death my brother's letter and particularly his last visit have altogether  given such an impetuosity to my thoughts as I want the power to repel Whither they will hurry me God only knows At one interval I imagine the earth contains nothing but evil At another strange to tell all is good all is wise all harmonious and I reproach my own extreme folly for wanting happiness under so perfect a system  'Nay there are times in which I persuade myself I have been guilty of no crime that there is no such thing as crime and that the distinctions of men are folly invented by selfishness and continued by ignorance  'Indeed I know not whither my thoughts do not range At one moment I seem as if I were actually free to penetrate the bowels of the earth dive into the deep transport myself with a wish from planet to planet or from sun to sun endure all extremes overcome them master all resistance and be myself omnipotent The very next instant perhaps  I doubt if I have really any existence if waking and dreaming be not the same thing and whether either of them are defineable or intelligible At this very moment I know not whither my thoughts are wandering or whether I ought not to snatch up this or the other weapon of death and instantly strike you breathless for having dared to listen to my shame'  While she spoke her eyes sparkled and flashed with that wildness which her tongue with such rapid imagery pictured forth Had it continued the tumult might have been dangerous perhaps fatal but fortunately the firmness and intrepidity of my mind were equal to the scene With a cool and collected benevolence of look and with a determined though not severe tone of voice I said 'My dear Miss Wilmot be calm pause a moment recollect yourself I am your friend I hope you will never find another man your foe'  The idea suggested an opposite association to her active thoughts in an instant the fire vanished her eyes were suffused her features relaxed and she again burst into tears and sobs I was careful not to interrupt the tide of passion it gave relief and she presently became more calm Desirous as I was of hearing particulars concerning the bishop I gladly listened when after a sufficient pause she thus resumed her tale  'You must not wonder Mr Trevor that I do not tell my story in a connected manner Whenever I think on the subject the incidents I have related press upon my mind produce sensations I cannot command and for a time obliterate less momentous circumstances  'The part which the bishop acted in this tragic drama is what I have yet to relate Mr Wakefield's father who let me here remark was an unprincipled man and died insolvent happened professionally  as a lawyer to have certain temporalities in the county where he resided to manage for the bishop This brought his son acquainted with the character of the prelate The relationship in which I stood to him'I interrupted her  'To whom madam'  'The bishop'  'I understood he was no relation of yours'  'He is and is not'  'Pray explain'  'He is by marriage twice removed not the least by blood His late lady a widow when he married her was the halfsister of my father's first wife so that by the courtesy of custom he is called my uncle He is too artful not to have a shelter for his proceedings She continued  'An adept which as I have before said Mr Wakefield is in reading the weak and vicious inclinations of the human  heart he hoped not only to have rid himself of importunity from me but by rendering me subservient to this unholy bishop's vile propensities to have played a deeper game This is his delight The pleasure he receives in making other men's follies passions and vices administer to his own is the greatest he knows Were he but the cunningest man on earth he would think himself the greatest  'His character sympathized with that of the bishop who was happy to find so artful and so active an agent It was not till I had been in the prelate's family some time that the whole of their design was explained to me The bishop frequently used strange and to me unintelligible expressions disgusting from any man but from him inexpressively offensive and odious yet the full import of them I did not so much as suspect  'Nor did he omit to make the solemnity  of his supposed character an abettor to his hypocrisy Feelings of compassion moral affection and christian forgivenness were assumed When I first entered his house he gave me to understand that he was acquainted with my crime this after mentioning it as a serious sin affecting pity he qualified away and as people in all such situations must talked an incoherent jargon that God hated and loved such sinners that religion was all powerful but that man was frail that Christ died to save us and therefore though we should fall as perhaps the best of us were subject to back slidings his mercy was all sufficient  'But on this and every occasion he was careful to say nothing open and direct by which he should be detected If ever he ventured so far as to excite serious questions from me he was ever ready with evasive answers and had something like reasoning to offer in defence  of his own manners and in ridicule of prudery He began with caution but when he had accustomed me to such discourse and after I had heard it repeated even in the presence of his clerical companions of which you Mr Trevor were once a witness my surprize wore away the pain it gave me was diminished and he became less and less reserved  'Still however he did not venture openly to declare himself and Mr Wakefield was too busy in wasting your mother's fortune and gratifying his own desires to attend to those of the bishop But his prodigality which is excessive after a time brought him to London and the bishop imagined that with his help my scruples would at last be conquered  'The trial was made not by the cautious bishop but by Mr Wakefield How such a proposition coming from the man whom I had dearly loved  and whose wife in justice I considered myself to be was received you who have a sense of the feelings of a highly injured and justly indignant heart may conceive  'Yet impassioned determined and almost frantic as I was it was with difficulty he could relinquish his plan Till that hour I never believed him so utterly devoid of principle but he then laid bare his heart hoping to make me a convert to its baseness He exulted in the power we should obtain over this sensual prelate and the sums which by these means we might extort He looked with transport forward to the opening which this would afford for projects still much deeper The vices of the great with which he might thus become intimate afforded a field ample as his own vice could wish Nor could all the impatience of indignation with which I continually interrupted him impede that flow which the subject inspired  'At length disgusted beyond sufferance I abruptly left him and sought relief from the racking sensations which he had excited He then entered into a correspondence with me till I threatened to shew his letters to the bishop This induced him to desist and for some time I heard from him no more At last he wrote once again informing me that you Mr Trevor were come to London characterizing you as ignorant of the world and easily deceived telling me that you were intimate with the bishop and advising me to promote a plan of marriage between us which he had proposed to the prelate as the best way in his own phrase of making all things smooth  'I hope the deep shame I felt when the bishop introduced you and made the experiment was sufficiently visible to convince you how repugnant my feelings were to such a crime  The bishop finding his first purpose  thus defeated and himself encumbered by a kind of claimant which his acknowledging me as a niece had brought upon him was determined at all events to rid himself of me Immediately before he left town he wrote me a letter telling me that my loss of character was become too public for me to receive any further countenance from a man under the moral and divine obligations which every bishop of the church of Christ must be that he was going on a visit to his diocese that he could not think of taking me it was too flagrantly improper and that he advised and expected I should immediately return to my relations further hoping that I should see the enormity of my conduct and reform  'Oh Mr Trevor what a world is this Had he offered me money I should have rejected it with disdain but he had not even that much charity I  instantly quitted the house with a few shillings only in my pocket  'Mary had lived with me and my mother for some years before my elopement after my mother's death my residence in the bishop's family being known I sent for her up to town and hired her Her artless affection made her my confidante my situation required it and when she heard the bishop's letter read the kind creature with honest anger instantly went and gave him warning  'A quarter's wages was all her wealth for the earnings of her labour she had constantly expended on her boy for whom she seems to have more than a mother's affection She has been my constant comforter Seeing the tears in my eyes as we left the bishop's house with a look of mingled pity and indignation she exclaimed'Do not grieve dear madam though I work my fingers to the bone you shall not want'  Miss Wilmot was proceeding with her narrative when she was interrupted by the hasty entrance of Mary 'Oh madam' said she 'the dear young lady and her maid are below They were coming up stairs but I told them that you had a gentleman with you Whereof at which the young lady seemed a little in amaze till I gave her to know that it was only a friend of your brother's a person from our own honest country and she would then a gone away but as I said I was sure you would be glad to see her and would go up a purpose to your own room So do you go madam and I'll run down and tell her'  Miss Wilmot immediately took her leave and though my curiosity was a little awakened a sense of decorum would not suffer me to endeavour to see her visitor I therefore shut the door and as soon as all was silent on the stairs I took my hat and walked out that by  changing the scene I migh dissipate a part of the melancholy which her story had produced  CHAP V ANGER UNABATED MORE NEWS OF THE BISHOP DELIBERATION ON THE MODE OF MY REVENGE THE ARTICLES ANSWERED AND NEW ASSAILING DOUBTS A VISIT TO TURL ADVICE GIVEN AND REJECTED AND FORMER FEELINGS REVIVED  THE next morning when I came to reflect on all that I had heard I was surprised with the degree in which by my mother's marriage with Wakefield I appeared to be implicated in the history The character of Wakefield his prodigality and total want of principle were all of a dangerous cast Not satisfied with beggaring my mother he had projected to marry me to his mistress The recollection of him roused resentment  and cunning and inventive as he was described to be I wished for an opportunity of punishing his baseness teaching him his own insignificance and treating him with the contempt he deserved If attacked I had not yet learned the philosophy of forbearance Though I have been hurried forward too fast to narrate every little incident as it occurred yet it cannot be imagined that I all this while neglected to peruse the defence of the articles published in the bishop's name No it was my very first employment on my arrival in town and though considerable trouble had been bestowed to disfigure the work as written by me yet in substance I found it to be the same The wrongs of Miss Wilmot quickened my feelings and angry as I was with Wakefield I felt emotions of ten fold bitterness against the bishop  Association easily conjured up the earl the president the tutor Themistocles  and the injustice and disgrace I had suffered at Oxford The fermentation was so great that I was determined immediately to expose them to the broad shame that should drive them from human society  In this benevolent project I was confirmed by another piece of intelligence One of the rich sees of the kingdom had become vacant The king's  congè d'elire  was issued and God's holy vicar the Bishop of ***** himself was translated What could I conclude but that the defence which I had written had been the cause I had been made the stepping stone of vice I remembered the proceeding of the despot Frederic of Prussia with the immortal Voltaire the orange had been squeezed and the rind thrown to rot in the highway  My teeth gnashed with the abundance of my wrath and the impotence of my means I had hitherto forborne to write from a perplexity of different plans At  one moment I determined to address my foes in the public papers at another I would concentrate the story and relate the whole in a pamphlet Now it should be a history anon a satirical novel Asmodeus in London in which I would draw the characters in such perfection that without mentioning names the persons should be visible to every eye But then this would not be sufficiently serious Thousands might mistake that for fiction which I wished all the world to know was fact To give them the least shelter was cowardly to myself treacherous to society and encouragement to the criminal  At last the pamphlet was the mode on which I determined and it was begun with all the enthusiasm that the accumulating circumstances could not but inspire in a being constituted like me Eager after every species of aggravation my anger could never be hot enough the gall of my ink was milk to  that of my heart The bitterness of my feelings was tormenting words that could burn contempt that could kill shame that could annihilate these and nothing less could satisfy me Could the serpent revenge fly how would it dart and sting Happily for man it can only crawl That I had been treated with great injustice was true but of justice my notions were very inadequate of revenge I had more than enough for a nation  While hot in the pursuit of this task I was diverted from it by the publication of an answer to the articles The moment I saw it advertised not sufficiently habituated to the vice of indolence myself to recollect that I had an idle footman below I hurried to the publisher's purchased it and returned with a greyhound speed to devour its contents  Disgusted as I was with the members of the church and beginning even to doubt of the perfect orthodoxy of the  church itself I still had too high an opinion of my own arguments to imagine the wit of man could overturn them  My haste had been so great that I had not taken off the paper in which the pamphlet was wrapped and in the shop I had read no more than the titlepage What was my surprise when snatching it from my pocket and opening it I discovered at the conclusion of a short preface the name of Turl it's author  My emotions were confused At one moment an answer from him was what I wished the next it was something like what I feared In all argument I had hitherto found him so cool so collected and so clear that to my imagination he perhaps was the only man on earth fit to cope with me But the grating question 'Was I fit to cope with him' would now and then recur I could not but feel that I had in a certain manner been subdued and cowed by his greater  extent of knowledge perspicuity and masculine genius By thoughts like these my anxiety if not my ardour was increased and I began to read  My forebodings were fulfilled The impotence of my arguments was exposed their absurdity and selfcontradiction ridiculed their evil tendency demonstrated their falsehood rendered odious and the author of them treated like a child My self respect was wounded at every line each paragraph was a death stab and I never before felt myself so completely ridiculous  As a lesson of philosophy it was the most serious salutary and impressive I ever received for though while reading I affirmed to myself that every thing urged against me was weak or ill founded inconclusive or absolutely false yet the arguments returned with increasing and reiterated force haunting and oppressing me like a painful dream from which I could not awake  The evil tendency which he proved against my doctrines was the least to be forgotten As far as I understood myself I had a sincere love of truth and an unfeigned desire to benefit not mislead and oppress mankind As the author of the defence the heavy charge of immorality was brought against me not by personal attacks on my substitute the bishop but by a detail of the consequences of such doctrines  This event made me pause and consider though with but little propensity to candour concerning the pamphlet on which I was then engaged Consideration however did but seem to confirm me in my puspose Let my defence be right or wrong and I had by no means yet decided in the negative still the turpitude of the bishop and my persecutors was no less flagitious These incidents once more turned my thoughts toward Turl whom I knew not whether to admire love or hate I was not so entirely  overwhelmed but that I had arguments at least I had words at my command Beside I felt a wish to communicate to him my projected attack and perhaps read a part of my pamphlet that it might as it certainly must meet his approbation I felt satisfied that what he approved could not be wrong And how disapprove On former occasions indeed my hopes in this respect had been deceived but now it was impossible The case was so clear In the present instance there could be but one opinion  Feelings which were not the most honourable to myself for their source was egotism had withheld me from visiting him since my return but these were now subdued by others that were more imperious I was not satisfied with requiring his approbation of my plan of vengeance my choleric vanity challenged him to the lists and the combat was resolved upon  As I was going I recollected the shortness  of the period in which his answer had been composed and published and this did but remind me of the champion I had to encounter  I found him as before tranquily pursuing his labours except that now he was writing engaged as I imagined on the grand work he had projected though his copper and engraving tools lay dispersed by his side He received me as usual with calmness but not without an evident mixture of pleasure Irritable as my feelings were I had always experienced something infinitely more dissatisfactory in being angry with him than with any other person In his countenance there was a sedate undeviating rectitude that but for my impetuous disdain of all restraint would have inspired awe yet whenever his eye met the eye of another there was something so benevolent as almost to disarm ill humour  Replete with new arguments as I supposed but which in reality were only a  repetition of those I had already adduced I burst upon him with a multitude of words defending my own defence of the articles and attacking his answer He made various ineffectual attempts to arrest my career and at last was obliged to suffer me to weary myself after which he calmly replied  'The best answer I can give to all you have urged is to request you will read the defence of the articles and my answer again with care Either I am mistaken or you will find every thing you have said already confuted'  I endeavoured to divert him from this defence by reference but he continued to urge that he should only weaken his cause by answering desultory arguments in a desultory way which in the present case would be folly because his answer was already given in a clear and as he believed conclusive manner  Finding his purpose not to be shaken I asked him if he were aware that I was  the author of the defence of the articles He answered that seeing the bishop's name to the publication he could not but suppose the bishop himself had been intimately concerned in the writing of the work but from what I had formerly told him he had suspected me to be a fellowlabourer  'If so' said I 'Mr Turl how did it happen that you felt no aversion to the confutation as you suppose of a man for whom you had professed a regard'  He replied 'you Mr Trevor are well acquainted with my answer "Socrates is my friend Plato is my friend but truth is more my friend" If I myself had written falsehood yesterday and now knew it to be such I would answer it to day Would not you'  It was a home question and I was silent  This subject ended he made some kind and cordial inquiries concerning my present pursuits and these furnished the  opportunity of unburthening my heart I related to him with all the indignation which resentment inspired my whole history and ended with informing him of my determination to publish the vice and infamy of all the parties to the world On this a dialogue began  'Which way will you publish them'  'In a narrative that I am now writing'  'A sense of duty has obliged me to tell you that in my opinion you have been guilty of several mistakes already you are now intent upon another'  'How so'  The excess of your anger perverts your judgment and you cannot write such a narrative without keeping your passions in a vitiated state Owing to the prejudices of mankind you will impeach your own credibility Moderate men will think you rash the precise will call you a detractor and the partisans who are numerous of the persons you will attempt  to expose will raise a cry against you that will infinitely overpower the equivocal proofs you can produce It will become a question of veracity and yours will be invalidated by the improbability if not of the guilt at least of the folly of your persecutor's conduct You cannot reform them will do yourself much harm and the world no good You will not only misemploy your time for the present but impede your power for the future'  'If such be the consequences of honestly speaking the truth what is the conduct that I am to pursue Am I to be a hypocrite and listen with approbation while men boast of their vices glory in their false principles and proclaim the destructive projects they mean to pursue'  'No'  'Is not silence approbation'  'Yes'  'Yet your system will not allow me to speak'  'You accuse my system unjustly it is the manner of speaking to which it attends The precaution of speaking so as to produce good not bad consequences is the doctrine I wish to inculcate He that should sweep the streets of peashells lest old women might break their necks would doubtless have good intentions yet his office would only be that of a scavenger Speak but speak to the world at large not to insignificant individuals Speak in the tone of a benevolent and disinterested heart and not of an inflamed and revengeful imagination otherwise you endanger yourself and injure society'  'What shall any cowardly regard to my own safety induce me to the falsehood of silence For is it not falsehood of the most contemptible and atrocious kind to forbear publishing such miscreants to the world It is this base this selfish prudence  that encourages men like these to proceed from crime to crime Had they been exposed in their first attempt their effrontery could never have been so enormous No I am determined Were my life to be the sacrifice I will hold them up a beacon alike to the wicked and the unwary Will paint them in the gross and odious colours that alone can characterize their actions and drive them from the society of mankind'  'Do you conceive you are now speaking in the spirit of justice or of revenge'  'Of both'  He who is resolved not to be convinced does not wish to hear his last argument answered With this short reply therefore I rose took my hat made some aukward apology was sorry we were fated to differ so continually in principle but each man must act from his own judgment was obliged to him nevertheless for his sincerity and good intention  and once more took my leave more angry than pleased much in the same abrupt manner that I had formerly done The similarity indeed forced itself upon me as I was quitting the door and I knew not whether to accuse myself of pettishness obstinacy and want of candour or him of singularity and an inflexible sternness of opposition At all events my purpose of publishing my pamphlet as soon as it should be written was fixed and to that labour I immediately returned  CHAP VI STORY OF MISS WILMOT CONCLUDED OLIVIA NOT FORGOTTEN A GAMINGTABLE FRIEND CHARACTERIZED MODERN MAGICIANS SUSPICIOUS PRINCIPLES THE

She might be in want and to relieve her would give me pleasure Beside which I had a number of questions to ask especially concerning this Wakefield and some desire to know who and what the young lady who was so great a favourite with Mary might be  In the evening I saw Miss Wilmot and in her offering with as much delicacy as possible pecuniary aid she informed me that fortunately she had found a friend generous beneficent and tender not less prudent than kind and though very young possessed of a dignity of understanding such as she had never before met in woman Miss Wilmot spoke with so much enthusiasm that I whose imagination readily caught fire felt a redoubled wish to see this angel  I hinted it to Miss Wilmot but with apologies and she replied that the young lady had expressly requested her visits  might be private and her name concealed I inquired how they had first become acquainted and learned that it was in consequence of the friendly zeal of Mary who had a countrywoman that lived servant in the family of this young lady and from whom she gained intelligence of the liberal and noble qualities of her mistress The first retreat of Miss Wilmot after leaving the house of the bishop was to a poor lodging provided by Mary From this she was removed by the friendly young lady to her present asylum till she could find the means of maintaining herself and had since been supplied with necessaries through the same channel 'The favours she confers on me' said Miss Wilmot 'are not so properly characterised by delicacy as by a much higher quality an open and unaffected sensibility of soul a benevolent intention of promoting human happiness and an unfeigned heart felt pleasure which accompanies her in the performance of  this delightful duty The particulars I have now related' continued she 'were all that remained to be told when I was interrupted by Mary at our last meeting and you are now acquainted with my whole story'  Every conversation that I had with Miss Wilmot confirmed the truth of her own remark that her intellect had been greatly awakened by the misfortunes in which her mistakes had involved her and particularly by the deep despondency of her brother He Wakefield and the young lady were the continual topics of her discourse but her brother the most and oftenest I was several times a witness that the papers were daily perused by her with all those quick emotions of dread which she had so emphatically described The terror of his parting resolution was almost too much for her and it was with difficulty she preserved her mind from madness I saw its tendency and took every opportunity to  sooth and calm her troubled spirit and my efforts were not wholly ineffectual  In the mean time I did not forget that I was not possessed of the purse of Fortunatus On the contrary I had a mighty task before me The image of Olivia incessantly haunted me The ineffable beauty of her form the sweet and never to be forgotten sensibility that she displayed when I first saw her in the presence of Andrews at Oxford and the native unaffected dignity of her mind were my constant themes of meditation Must I behold her in the arms of another The thought was horror Yet how to obtain her If I studied the law preliminary forms alone would consume years From the church I was banished A military life I from principle abhorred even my half ripe philosophy could not endure the supposition of being a hireling cutthroat Literature might afford me fame but of riches gained from  that source there was scarcely an example  From literary merit however men had obtained civil promotion it must not therefore be neglected Of such neglect indeed my passionate love of letters would not admit With respect to law though infinitely too slow for the rapidity of my desires still it was good to be prepared for all events I therefore entered myself of the Temple and thus began another snailpace journey of term keeping  Youth is a busy season and though occupations are forced upon it of a nature too serious for its propensities it fails not to find time for amusement In St James'sstreet near the palace was a billiardtable to which when an inmate with Lord Idford I had resorted It was frequented by officers of the Guards and other persons who were chiefly supposed to be men of some character and fashion Among them I had met a young gentleman  of the name of Belmont remarkable for the easy familiarity of his address an excellent billiard player and who had in a manner attached himself to me by a degree of attention that was engaging I thought indeed that I discovered contradictory qualities in him but the sprightliness of his imagination and the whimsicality of his remarks compensated for a looseness of principle which was too apparent to be entirely overlooked  He frequently turned the conversation on the county of which I was a native having as he informed me and as his discourse shewed many acquaintance in that county Since my return to town I had again met him and he had sought my company with increasing ardour  Flattered by this preference and often delighted with the flights of his fancy I returned his advances with great cordiality His appearance was always genteel but from various circumstances I collected that he was not at present rich  His expectations according to his own account were great and his familiar habits of treating every man be his rank or fashion what it might seemed to signify that he considered himself their equal  When we first met after my return to town he was desirous I should relate to him where I had been and what had befallen me and when he heard that I had visited the county of he became more pressing to know all that had happened To encourage me he gave me the following account of himself  'For my own part Mr Trevor I am at present under a cloud I shall sometime or another break forth and be a gay fellow once again nor can I tell how soon I love to see life and I do not believe there is a man in England of my age who has seen more of it Perhaps you will laugh when I tell you that since we last parted I have been  vagabondizing  You do not understand the term  It offends your delicacy I will explain'  He saw he had raised my curiosty and with a loquacity that sat easy on him and a vivacity of imagery in which as I have said he excelled he thus continued  'Perhaps you will think a gentleman degraded by having subjected himself to the denomination of a vagrant Though no you have wit enough to laugh at graybeards and their ridiculous forms and absurd distinctions Know then there is a certain set or society of men frequently to be met in straggling parties about this kingdom who by a peculiar kind of magic will metamorphose an old barn stable or outhouse in such a wonderful manner that the said barn stable or outhouse shall appear according as it suits the will or purpose of the said magicians at one time a prince's palace at another a peasant's cottage now the noisy receptacle of drunken  clubs and wearied travellers called an inn anon the magnificent dome of a Grecian temple Nay so vast is their art that by pronouncing audibly certain sentences which are penned down for them by the head or master magician they transport the said barn stable or outhouse thus metamorphosed over sea or land rocks mountains or deserts into whatsoever hot cold or temperate region the director wills with as much facility as my lady's squirrel can crack a nut What is still more wonderful they carry all their spectators along with them without the witchery of broomsticks  'These necromancers although whenever they please they become princes kings and heroes and reign over all the empires of the vast and peopled earth though they bestow governments viceroyalties and principalities upon their adherents divide the spoils of nations among their pimps pages and parasites and give a kingdom for a kiss for they  are exceedingly amorous yet no sooner do their sorceries cease though but the moment before they were reveling and banqueting with Marc Antony or quaffing nectar with Jupiter himself it is a safe wager of a pound to a penny that half of them go supperless to bed A set of poor but pleasant rogues miserable but merry wags that weep without sorrow stab without anger die without dread and laugh sing and dance to inspire mirth in others while surrounded themselves with wretchedness  'A thing still more remarkable in these enchanters is that they completely effect their purpose and make those who delight in observing the wonderful effects of their art laugh or cry condemn or admire love or hate just as they please subjugating the heart with every various passion more especially when they pronounce the charms and incantations of a certain sorcerer called Shakspeare  whose science was so powerful that he himself thus describes it  I have oft bedimm'd  The noontide sun call'd forth the mutinous winds  And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault  Set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder  Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak  With his own bolt the strongbas'd promontory  Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up  The pine and cedar graves at my command  Have wak'd their sleepers op'd and let them forth  By my so potent art  'I understand you' said I delighted with the picture he had drawn 'Your necessities have obliged you to turn player'  'Not altogether my necessities' answered he 'it was more from a frolic and to know the world That is my study Mr Trevor But can you tell me why players by following their profession act  in some places contrary to all law and are called strollers vagabonds and vagrants and in others are protected by the law and dignified with the high and mighty title of his Majesty's Servants'  'Indeed I cannot' said I  He continued 'Mark my words the day will come Mr Trevor when you will discover that there are greater jugglers in the world than your players wonderful as their art of transformation is The world is all a cheat its pleasures are for him who is most expert in legerdemain and cajolery and he is a fool indeed who is juggled out of his share of them But that will not I be'  He then turned the conversation to me and what had happened during my visit in the country I was beginning my short narrative but we were interrupted by an acquaintance who joined us and we two or three times met again  in the billiardroom before any opportunity presented itself  One evening however he followed me out and required me to discharge my promise Accordingly I told him all that had occurred but not without those feelings of indignation which the subject always awakened He rather seemed diverted than to sympathize in my angry sensations and asked me 'whether I thought those men whom the world call swindlers blacklegs and other hard names were not at least as honest as many of their neighbours'  He paid most attention to my mother's story and I having characterized Wakefield according to the traits my mother and Miss Wilmot had given me he observed that 'this Wakefield must certainly be a cunning fellow and of no mean abilities'  'In my opinion' I replied 'he is an unprincipled scoundrel and indeed a greater fool than knave for with the  same ingenuity that he has exerted to make all mankind his enemies he might have made them all his friends'  Belmont's answer was remarkable 'You have this ingenuity yourself Mr Trevor talents which you have exerted in your own way Have you made all men your friends'  I was silent and after a moment's pause he added'Come come You have spirit and generosity I will tell you how you can serve me I have a relation from whom I could draw a good supply at this moment if I had but a small sum for travelling expences Lend me ten guineas I will be back in a week and repay you'  The pleasantness of his humour and the manner in which he had gained upon me were sufficient to insure him a compliance with this request I had the money in my pocket gave it him and we bade each other adieu with a promise on his part that 'he would soon be  in town again new moulted and full of feather'  I must not omit to notice that having had occasion to hint at Miss Wilmot in the story I had told him but without mentioning her name which he never indeed seemed desirous to know he put many questions relating to her He inquired too concerning her brother and though he gave no tokens of deep passion was evidently interested in the whole narrative His queries extended even to the bishop and the earl and he discovered a great desire to be minutely informed of all that related to me His interrogatories were answered without reserve for I understood them as tokens of friendship  In less than a fortnight I met him again at the usual place for he had always been averse to visit me at my lodgings This I had attributed to motives of vanity for example his not having apartments perhaps such as he wished  to invite me to in return His appearance the moment I saw him spoke his success His dress was much improved he sported his money freely and being engaged at play more than once betted ten pounds upon the hazard He was successful in his match in high spirits welcomed me heartily and was full of those flights in which his vigorous imagination was so happy  'Life' said he 'Trevor' putting on his coat after he had done play 'life is a game at calculation and he that plays the best of it is the cleverest fellow Or rather calculation and action are husband and wife married without a possibility of divorce The greatest errors of Mrs Action proceed from a kind of headstrong feminine propensity which she has to be doing before her husband Mr Calculation has given her proper directions She often pours a spoonful of scalding soup into his worship's mouth before the relative heat between the liquid  and the papillary nerves has been properly determined at which in the aforesaid true feminine spirit she is apt while he makes wry faces to burst into a violent fit of laughter  'Not but that Mrs Action herself has sometimes very just cause of complaint against her spouse as most wives have For example If in coming down stairs Mr Calculation have made an occasional error but of a unit and told her ladyship she had only one step more to descend when she had two she coming with an unexpected jerk in the increased ratio of a falling body is very much alarmed and when the tip of her rosecoloured tongue has happened on such occasions to project a little beyond the boundaries prescribed by those beautiful barriers of ivory called her teeth it has suffered a sudden incision nay sometimes amputation itself a very serious  mischief for this is wounding a lady in a tender part  'What is error Defect in calculation What is ignorance Defect in calculation What is poverty disgrace and all the misfortunes to which fools are subject Defect in calculation'  By this time we were in the street walking arm in arm toward the park and he continued his jocular allegory  'You tell me you have a mind to turn author and this makes me suspect you understand but little of the algebra of authorship Could you but calculate the exact number of impediments doubts and disappointments attending the trade could you but find the sum of the objections which yourself your friends and your employers will raise not only against your book but against the best book that ever was or will be written the remainder would be a query the produce of which would be a negative quantity  which would probably prevent both Sir and Madam from reading either the nonsense or the good sense the poetry or the prose the simple or the sublime of the rhapsodical metaphorical allegorical genius Hugh Trevor for in that case I suspect Hugh Trevor would find a more pleasant and profitable employment than the honourable trade of authorship I have read books much but men more and think I can bring my wit to a better market than the slow and tedious detail of an A B C manufactory'  I laughed and listened and he presently broke forth with another simile  'In what is the maker of a book better than the maker of a coat Needle and thread pen and ink cloth uncut and paper unsoiled where is the preference except that the tailor's materials are the more costly In days of yore the gentlemen of the thimble gave us plenty of staytape and buckram the  gentlemen of the quill still give us a  quantum sufficit  of hard words and parenthesis The tailor has discovered that a new coat will sit more  degagè  and wear better the less it is incumbered by trimmings but though buckram is almost banished from Monmouthstreet it is still on sale in Paternosterrow  'I once began to write a book myself and began it in this very style Fable said I is the cloth and morality the lining a good diction makes an excellent facing satire ensures fashion and humour duration and for an author to pretend to write without wit and judgment were as senseless as for a tailor to endeavour to work without materials or shears to cut them Periods may aptly be compared to buttons and button holes are like  'I could find no simile for button holes and thank heaven left off in despair and never wrote another line  'Take my advice Trevor quit all  thoughts of so joyless and stupifying a trade Every blockhead can sneer at an author the title itself is a sarcasm and Job who we are told was the most patient of men uttered the bitterest wish that ever fell from lips "Oh that mine enemy had written a book"  'Beside you are a fellow of spirit fashion form and figure and if you will but keep company with me may learn a little wit How many fools are there with full purses which if you be not as great a fool as any of them you might find the means to empty He that is bound by rules which the rich make purposely to rob the poor of their due is like crows scared from picking up the scattered corn by rags and a manikin'  This discourse gave me no surprise it was what I imagined to be a free loose mode of talking that did not correspond with his principles of action I deemed it a love of paradox a desire to shew  his wit and original turn of thought and was confirmed in the supposition by his ironical and ludicrous replies whenever I attempted a serious answer Such was the history of the beginning of an acquaintance of which the reader will hear more  CHAP VII AN IMPORTANT SECRET BETRAYED BY MARY TRANSPORTING INTELLIGENCE THE REVERSE OR RAIN AFTER SUNSHINE THE READER ENTRUSTED WITH A SECRET STRANGE BEHAVIOUR OF A FALSE FRIEND LOVER'S VOWS  I DID not suffer a day to pass without either seeing or sending to inquire after Miss Wilmot so that our intercourse was continual One afternoon being in my own room after hearing as I thought footsteps and female voices on the stairs Mary knocked at my door and entering  as desired shewed marks of eagerness on her countenance the meaning of which a question from me immediately caused her to explain 'Lord Sir' said she 'you cannot think what a hurry and flurry I be in And all about you  'Me Mary'  'You shall hear Sir My mistress is gone out to take a walk in the park as I  avised  her to  divart  her  mellicholy  and so the dear young lady has  bin  here Miss I had forgotten I  munna  tell her name But if ever there  wur  an angel upon  arth  she is one she says such kind things to my dear mistress and does not blame her for her fault for  thof  she be as innocent herself as the child unborn she can pity the  misfortins  of her own  sect  when they a  bin  betrayed by false hearted men and all that she says is that we  mun  take care to be more becautioned for the time to come and then she says it in so sweet and yet so  serus  a manner that I am sure no  christian soul if they'd a heard her would dare do other than as she says And as for a doing a good turn I do verily believe she would give the morsel out of her mouth afore a poor creature should be driven to sin and shame for want'  I interrupted her she had raised some strong surmises and I was impatient 'But you forget Mary you mentioned something concerning me'  'Oh lord yea a mort o' questions a  bin  asked for she talks as familiarity to me as if she  wur  a poor body herself which gives me heart so that I be not  afeard  to speak Whereof I could not help telling her a great many things about you as how when little more but a child you saved my life and  consarning  your goodness and kind offers to my dear mistress and how soft hearted and well spoken you  wur  even to poor me just for all the world as I said like her own dear good self Whereupon it gladdened her heart to hear there  wur  another good creature as good as herself And so she asked  ater  your name which you know that being no secret I told her and then it  wur  if you had but a seen her Her face  wur  as pale as my kerchief and I asked what ailed her ladyship And she replied in a faint voice Nothing So that I thought there must for  sartinly  be a  summut  between you for she sat down and seemed to do so as if a struggling for breath And I ran for a smelling bottle whereupon she  wur  better and said she did not need it And so she asked how long you had lived in the house and whether you looked happy And I answered and said there  wur  not a kinder happier creature breathing So she asked again if I  wur  quite sure that you  wur  happy And I said I  wur mortally sartin  of it So then she fetched a deep sigh from the very bottom of her heart and said she  wur  glad of it very glad of it indeed For said she my  good Mary for she often calls me good which I be very sure is her kindness and not my  desarts  my good Mary said she I don't wonder that you do love Mr Trevor for having a saved your life He once saved my life which says she I shall remember the longest day I have to breathe and'  'It is she' exclaimed I for I could hold no longer 'It is Olivia Benevolent angel And does she deign to think of me Does she inquire after me Am I still in her thoughts'  'Anan' said Mary 'I hope I a betrayed no secrets For surely I ha' not mentioned a word of her name'  Just as I was continuing to question Mary farther Miss Wilmot returned I earnestly requested she would come into my apartment related the discovery I had made and spoke with all that enthusiasm which the revival of hope and the ardour of passion could inspire Miss Wilmot sympathized with my feelings  and with a fervour that spoke the kindness of her heart hoped she should one day see a pair so worthy of each other blessed to the full accomplishment of their wishes but she confessed she had her fears for she thought that the remark that lovers best calculated to make each other happy were seldom united was but too true  I prevailed on her to take tea with me Mary waited and I put a thousand questions to her for my conversation was all on this subject I could think of nothing else O how pure was the delight of this discovery That Olivia should quit the scenes of tumultuous joy and seek the forlorn and unfortunate purposely to mitigate their wants and administer consolation to their woes was knowledge inexpressibly sweet to the soul And that she should still remember me that my very name should raise such commotions in her bosom that she should delight to hear my praise and  recollect the fortunate moment when I bore her from death with such affection It was rapture unspeakable  I learned from Mary that she lived with her aunt a few streets distant and Miss Wilmot informed me that she constantly visited her twice and sometimes oftener each week How did my bosom burn with the wish that she might return that very evening or at least the next day In the impatience and ecstacy of hope I forgot all impediments Let me but see her let me but know that she was in the house and I supposed the moment of perfect bliss would then be come Happy evening Never did seductive fancy paint more delicious dreams or raise up phantoms more flattering to the heart  Pains and pleasures dance an eternal round The very next day brought sensations of an opposite kind My mother had found no person of whom to purchase an annuity in the country for  the money being her own by my free gift she had not thought proper to venture it with Thornby lest under the pretext of monies advanced he should make she knew not what deduction She had therefore written to me soon after I came to London to find her a purchaser and after some delay which the necessity of consulting persons better informed than myself had occasioned I had advertised the week before and had entered into a negotiation  Terms were agreed upon and the rough copy of a deed for that purpose was brought me the same morning that the following letter arrived  'SIR  'In spite of my caution your mother has played the fool once more She was too suspicious to trust the money in my hands though I warned her to beware of accidents I must say she is a very weak woman Her husband Mr Wakefield  has made his appearance and has trumped up some tale or another to impose upon her which I am sorry to find is no difficult thing He has got the money you gave her so what is to become of her I do not know She expects he will fetch her away within a month and keep her like a lady on the profits of some place at court which according to his account a friend was to procure for him if he could but raise five hundred pounds You may think how likely he is to keep his promise I told her my mind in plain terms and I believe she begins to be in a panic She dare not write to you on which I thought it best to let you know the truth at once for as I said before what is to become of her I do not know  I am c 'NABAL THORNBY'  The train of ideas which the strange contents of this epistle excited was painful  in the extreme The idiot conduct of my mother tempted me to curse not her indeed but according to the narrow limits of prejudice God and her excepted all things else Yet who but she was the chief actor in this scene of lunatic folly Was there a woman on earth beside herself that would have been so grossly gulled  As for her husband the bitterness of gall was not so choaking as the recollection of him The sight or sound of his name excited disgust too intense to be dwelt upon To suffocate him as a monster or a sooterkin seemed the only punishment of which he was worthy  And here it is necessary I should inform the reader of a secret of which I was myself at that time and long continued to remain utterly ignorant Belmont the man who had purposely thrown himself in my way industriously made himself my intimate informed me as I supposed of his private affairs and motives  of action inquired minutely into mine wormed every intelligence I could give that related to myself out of me designedly attached me to him by intellectual efforts of no mean or common kind for he saw they delighted me and they were familiar to him Belmont I say possessed of a pleasing person a winning aspect and an address that though studied with the deepest art appeared to be open unpremeditated and too daring for disguise this Belmont was no other than the hated Wakefield Yes it was Wakefield himself that by a stratagem which drove me half mad while it made every drop of blood in his body tingle with triumph had thus circumvented me He it was who borrowed the ten guineas from me by the aid of which he robbed me of five hundred and then returned to observe how I endured the goad laugh at my restive antics and revel in the plunder which he had purloined with so much facility from  foolish Trevor and his still more foolish mother  But this was not the only trick he had to play me Secure in the resources of an invention that might have been occupied in pursuits worthy of his powers his perverted philosophy taught him to employ these resources only for the gratification of passions which he thought it folly to control and to exult over men whose sordid selfishness he despised and whose limited cunning was the subject of his derision He professed himself the disciple of La Rochefoucault and Mandeville and his practice did not belie his principles  From the tenor of his discourse I am persuaded that had he found me apt at adopting his maxims he would have unbosomed himself freely have initiated me in his own arts and by making me the associate of his projects have induced me to look back on the past rather with merriment than anger As it was  he reserved himself to act with me as with the rest of mankind to watch circumstances and turn them to his own purposes whenever opportunity should offer  This was the man who was the hero of the letter I had just received A letter that I could neither read nor recollect without being stung almost to frenzy yet that I could neither forget nor forbear to peruse  During two hours I traversed my room and chafed with something like bursting anguish A few weeks ago when I had received my legacy of the lawyer I seemed to be encumbered with wealth Reflection and the expence at which I now lived to the visible and quick consumption of a sum I then thought so ample had since taught me that I was in imminent danger of being reduced to beggary I had no profession nor any means of subsistence till a profession could be secured at least no  adequate means unless by retiring to some humble garret and confining myself to the society of the illiterate the boorish and the brutal between whose habits and mine there was no congeniality The very day before Olivia ecstatic vision had risen in full view of my delighted hopes and forgetting the tormenting distance which malignant fate had placed between us I almost thought her mine The recollection of her now was misery  Restless desponding agonizing when this thought occurred I was hastening to go and communicate the accursed news to Miss Wilmot but an idea started which after a moment's reflection induced me to desist If I told her the story of Wakefield must again be revived Olivia too might be informed of circumstances concerning my silly mother which selfishness out of the question motives of delicacy ought to conceal Such were my arguments at that time I had  not then the same moral aversion to secrecy that I now possess  I could not however any longer endure the present scene and to get rid of it hurried away to the billiard table where as usual I found the then supposed Belmont He was not himself at play but was engaged in betting Impatient to unburthen my heart for as far as my own affairs were concerned I had now no secrets for him I hurried him out of the room immediately that the game was ended  The moment we came into the park I shewed him my letter and desired him to read While he perused it I saw he was more than once violently tempted to laugh  'Well' said he returning it and restraining his titillation 'Is this all'  'All' answered I 'What more would you have Could the maleficent devil himself do more to drive a man mad'  He looked in my face I returned the  inquisitive gaze I saw emotions the very reverse of mine struggling to get vent His opposing efforts were ineffectual he could contain himself no longer and burst into a violent fit of laughter  Astonished at mirth so ill placed and offensive I asked what it meant The tone of my interrogatory was rouzing and recalled his attention 'Pshaw Trevor' replied he with a glance of half contemptuous pity 'you are yet young you are but at the beginning of your troubles Your over weening fondness for the musty morality of dreaming dotards or artful knaves who only made rules that they might profit by breaking them will be your ruin I tell you again and again if you do not prey upon the world the world will prey upon you There is no alternative What be bubbled out of your fortune by a whining old woman I am ashamed of you'  'But that woman is my mother'  'Yes and a set of very pretty motherly tricks she has played you Not that in the first instance it was so much your fault who were but a boy as that of your old fool of a grandfather It is now high time however that you should become a man'  'My grandfather Say rather it was the scoundrel Wakefield  'You seem very angry with this Wakefield And why He appears to me to be a fellow of plot wit and spirit Instead of resentment were I you I should be glad to become acquainted with the man who so well perceives the stupidity and folly of the animals around him laughs at their apish antics and with so much facility turns their absurd whims to his own advantage'  'Acquainted Intuitive rascal I would cut off his ears Drag him to the pillory with my own hands He is unworthy a nobler revenge'  'Pshaw Ridiculous What did  your mother want but the gratification of her paltry passions which were but the dregs and lees of goatish inclination for with her the pervading headlong torrent of desire was passed Did she think of morality She would have sacrificed the youth and high spirits of Wakefield to her own salacious doating Why should not he too have his wishes Were his the most criminal or the least fitted for the faculties of enjoyment'  'You have not heard me defend my mother's conduct but his villany to the young lady I formerly mentioned meaning Miss Wilmot deserves the execration of every man'  'That is as she tells the story Women poor simple creatures are always to be pitied never blamed But a little more experience Trevor will tell you the devil himself is not half so cunning Men are universally their dupes nay their slaves though called their tyrants Do not men consume their lives in toils  to please them Who are the chief instigators to what you call vice and folly Who are the mischief makers of the world Who incite us to plunder rob and cut each other's throats Who but woman And is not a little retaliation to be expected Poor dear souls Cunning as serpents Trevor but though fond of cooing not harmless as doves Crocodiles that only weep to catch their prey I once was told of one that died broken hearted a great beauty and much bewept by all the maudlin moralizers that knew her The cause of her grief was a handsome fellow who of course was a cruel perjured villain The tale had great pathos and would have been very tragical had it but been true Ages before that in which Jove laughed at them lover's perjuries were the common topic of scandal and so continue to be I have often been reproached in the same way myself and I once took the trouble to write an apology  for which as it will suit all true lovers all true lovers are bound to thank me Here it is▪'  I  Men's vows are false Annette I own  The proofs are but too flagrant grown  To Love I vow'd eternal scorn  I saw thee and was straight forsworn  II  In jealous rage renouncing bliss  When Damon stole a rapturous kiss  I took with oaths a long farewell  How false they were thou best can'st tell  III  By saints I vow'd and pow'rs divine  No love could ever equal mine  Yet I myself though thus I swore  Have daily lov'd thee more and more  IV  To perjuries thus I hourly swerve  Then treat them as they well deserve  Thy own vows break at length comply  And be as deep in guilt as I  'What think you was not this a valid plea Are not women apt to take the advice here given them Lovely hypocrites They delight in being forced to follow their own inclinations'  There was no resisting the playfulness of his wit and the exhilarating whim of his manner My ill humour soon evaporated and yielding to the sympathetic gaiety he had inspired I said to him  'You are a wicked wit Belmont But though I laugh do not imagine I am a convert to your mandevilian system it is false pernicious and destructive of the end which it pretends to secure'  'Do not abuse my system or me either' replied he 'I tell you I am the only honest man of my acquaintance and the first effort of my honesty is as it ought to be that of being honest to myself'  'I hear many men profess the same opinions but I find them acting on different principles'  'You mistake You are young I tell you Every man's actions are strongly tinged by the principles he professes'  My countenance became a little more serious'Surely you do not avow yourself a rascal'  'Pshaw Epithets are odious I do not know the meaning of the word nor do you'  Our conversation continued it relieved me from a bitterness of chagrin from which I was happy to escape We dined together His slow of spirits and raillery were unabating I combated his opinions he laughed at my arguments rather than answered them and though I even then conceived him to be a very bad moralist I thought him a delightful companion  CHAP VIII REVENGE NOT FORGOTTEN THE VISIT DELAYED WILMOT AND HIS POETICAL POWERS DREADFUL INTELLIGENCE AN APPALLING PICTURE A FRUITLESS SEARCH FOLLOWED BY A SURPRISING DISCOVERY  STIMULATED by the ridicule of Belmont though I never had a thought of abandoning my mother to want still I determined according to the proverb to let her bite the bridle Instead of writing therefore I waited till she should write to me  Mean time my pamphlet was the grand object of present pursuit When I began it I imagined it would scarcely have been the work of a day certainly not of a week I was deceived To a man who has any sense of justice who fears to affirm the thing that is not yet is determined to be inexorable in revenge no task is so harrassing as that which I  had undertaken Page after page was written rewritten corrected interlined scratched blotted and thrown in the fire The work had been three times finished and three times destroyed It was a fourth time begun and still the labour was no less oppressive irritating and thorny  It was in this state at the time that Mary brought me the joyful intelligence relating to Olivia I had watched with unremitting assiduity during those hours of the day when she had been accustomed to visit Miss Wilmot but my watchings were fruitless she came no more  The fourth day after her last visit she sent a note to Miss Wilmot informing her that her aunt was going to Bath for the recovery of her health to which place it was necessary that she should attend her The blow was violent and would have been felt more violently even than it was had it not been for an event which I must now relate  The alarms of Miss Wilmot concerning her brother had not been lightly excited they might rather be called prophetic She had indeed strongly communicated her terror to me One morning I was meditating on the subject and recollecting those early days when gathering the first fruits of genius I was taught by him to distinguish and enjoy the beauties of its emanations and the sublimity of its flights His affection for me though but a boy had induced him to give me some short poetical compositions of his own I was reading them over with strong feelings partly of sorrow and partly of indignation at the folly and injustice of a world that could overlook such merit One of them in particular which I had always admired for the simple yet pathetic spirit of poetry in which it was written I was then perusing It was the following  I  Ho Why dost thou shiver and shake  GafferGray  And why doth thy nose look so blue  ''Tis the weather that's cold  'Tis I'm grown very old  And my doublet is not very new  Welladay'  II  Then line thy worn doublet with ale  GafferGray  And warm thy old heart with a glass  'Nay but credit I've none  And my money's all gone  Then say how may that come to pass  Welladay'  III  Hie away to the house on the brow  GafferGray  And knock at the jolly priest's door  'The priest often preaches  Against worldly riches  But ne'er gives a mite to the poor  Welladay'  IV  The lawyer lives under the hill  GafferGray  Warmly fenc'd both in back and in front  'He will fasten his locks  And will threaten the stocks  Should he ever more find me in want  Welladay'  V  The squire has fat beeves and brown ale  GafferGray  And the season will welcome you there  'His fat beeves and his beer  And his merry new year  Are all for the flush and the fair  Welladay'  VI  My keg is but low I confess  GafferGray  What then While it lasts man we'll live  The poor man alone  When he hears the poor moan  Of his morsel a morsel will give  Welladay  In that precise state of mind which associations such as I have described and a poem like this could excite when I was alike bewailing the madness and turpitude of mankind that could be  blind to the worth of a man such as Wilmot while glowing I say and thrilling with these sensations my breakfast was brought and with it a paper What shall I sayIt contained what follows "Yesterday a middle aged man of a genteel and orderly appearance was seen to walk despondingly beside the Serpentine river A gentleman who having met him remarked the agitation of his countenance suspected his design and concealing himself behind some trees at a little distance watched him and at last saw him throw himself into the water The gentleman who was a good swimmer jumped in after him but could not immediately find the body which after he had brought it out was conveyed to Marylebone watchhouse A few shillings were found in his pocket but nothing to indicate his name place of abode or other information except a written paper containing  the following melancholy account of himself  This body if ever this body should be found was once a thing which by way of reproach among men was called an author It moved about the earth despised and unnoticed and died indigent and unlamented It could hear see feel smell and taste with as much quickness delicacy and force as other bodies It had desires and passions like other bodies but was denied the use of them by such as had the power and the will to engross the good things of this world to themselves The doors of the great were shut upon it not because it was infected with disease or contaminated with infamy but on account of the fashion of the garments with which it was cloathed and the name it derived from its forefathers and because it had not the habit of bending its knee where its heart owed no respect nor the power  of moving its tongue to gloze the crimes or flatter the follies of men It was excluded the fellowship of such as heap up gold and silver not because it did but for fear it might ask a small portion of their beloved wealth It shrunk with pain and pity from the haunts of ignorance which the knowledge it possessed could not enlighten and guilt that its sensations were obliged to abhor There was but one class of men with whom it was permitted to associate and those were such as had feelings and misfortunes like its own among whom it was its hard fate frequently to suffer imposition from assumed worth and fictitious distress Beings of supposed benevolence capable of perceiving loving and promoting merit and virtue have now and then seemed to flit and glide before it But the visions were deceitful Ere they were distinctly seen the phantoms vanished Or if such beings do exist  it has experienced the peculiar hardship of never having met with any in whom both the purpose and the power were fully united Therefore with hands wearied with labour eyes dim with watchfulness veins but half nourished and a mind at length subdued by intense study and a reiteration of unaccomplished hopes it was driven by irresistible impulse to end at once such a complication of evils The knowledge was imposed upon it that amid all these calamities it had one consolationIts miseries were not eternalThat itself had the power to end them This power it has employed because it found itself incapable of supporting any longer the wretchedness of its own situation and the blindness and injustice of mankind and as while it lived it lived scorned and neglected so it now commits itself to the waves in expectation after it is dead of being mangled belied and insulted  Oh God what were my feelings while reading this heart appalling story It contained volumes and sufficiently spoke the strength of the mind that could thus picture its own sensations It must be my beloved Wilmot it could be no one else or even if it were the man who thus could feel and thus could write was no less the object of admiration grief and a species of regret of the guilt of which every man partook It was an act of attainder against the whole world in the infamy of which each man had his share  Transfixed with horror as I was I still had the recollection to conceal the paper from the eye of Miss Wilmot and that instant to go in quest of the body The utmost speed and diligence were necessary she must soon hear of the fatal event and it was much to be dreaded that this would not be the last act of the tragedy  According to the indication given in  the paper I went immediately to the watchhouse but was surprised to find that the body was not there They had heard something of a man throwing himself into the Serpentine river but could give no farther information  I then ran to every bonehouse and receptacle in the various adjoining parishes but without success The only intelligence I could obtain was that the gentleman who leaped in after the man in order to have saved his life had taken the body home with him but no one could direct me where he lived  The circumstance was distracting My terrors for Miss Wilmot increased I knew not what course to pursue At last I recollected that Turl from having lived some years in London being acquainted with the manners of the place and possessing great sagacity might perhaps afford me aid Personal knowledge of Wilmot he probably had none for he quitted the grammar school at  *** just before Wilmot became its head usher But I knew not what better to do and to this as a kind of last hope I resorted and hastened away to his lodgings  It may well be supposed my tone of mind was gloomy For a man like Wilmot with virtues so eminent sensations so acute and a mind so elevated to be thus impelled to seek a refuge in death was a thought that almost made me hate existence myself and doubt whether I might not hereafter be driven to the same desperate expedient to escape the odious injustice of mankind The distraction too which would seize on Miss Wilmot haunted my thoughts for I was convinced that the intelligence whenever it should reach her would prove fatal  Full of these dismal reflections I arrived at the door of Turl knocked and was desired to come in Turl rose as I entered and with him a stranger who  had been seated by his side A stranger and yet with features that were not wholly unknown to me He seemed surprised at the sight of me examined me fixed his eyes on me Memory was very busy Associating ideas poured upon me I gazed I remembered Heavens and earth What was my astonishment what were my transports when in this very stranger I discovered Mr Wilmot Living Pale meagre dejected and much altered but living  Turl was the gentleman in the park who had observed the deep melancholy visible in his countenance had fortunately suspected his intention had brought him out of the water had discovered favourable symptoms and instead of either taking him home or to the watchhouse had conveyed him to St George's hospital where he immediately obtained medical aid that had preserved his life Turl was the person  whose courage humanity and wisdom had prolonged the existence of a man of genius and who was now exerting all his faculties to render that existence happy to the possessor and beneficial to the human race Oh moment of inconceivable rapture Why are not sensations so exquisite eternal  CHAP IX I SECURE MISS WILMOT AGAINST THE DANGER OF FALSE ALARM AND RETURN TO HEAR THE HISTORY OF HER BROTHER  EAGER as I was to contribute all in my power to tranquilize the mind of Mr Wilmot to renew my friendship with him and to learn his history from himself I yet made but a short stay and hastened home to his sister Fortunately the tragic tale had not reached her and without relating circumstances that if abruptly told might have excited alarm  I informed her that I had that moment parted from him and that now I had found him I should use my utmost endeavour to reconcile him to her once more  To hear that he was still in being gave an undescribable relief to her mind It beamed in her countenance and called up thoughts that soon made her burst into tears  Having by this information secured her against the ill effects which might otherwise have followed I escaped further question from her for the present by truly telling her I was impatient to return to her brother  I found the two friends still conversing for friends and sincere ones they were become The account given by Wilmot of himself had been taken and sent to the newspaper without the knowledge of Turl but he had read it and it was a sufficient index of the mind of the writer and the behaviour of Turl through the  whole affair as well as the sentiments he uttered in every breath were enough to convince Mr Wilmot of his uncommon worth  On my return the latter was defending the right of man to commit suicide which Turl denied not on the false and untenable ground of superstition but from the only true argument the immoral tendency of the act He was delicate though decisive in his opposition and only requested Mr Wilmot to consider whether to effect the good of the whole be not the true purpose of virtue Ought not the good of the whole therefore to be its only rule and guide If so can the man who possesses that degree of activity without which he cannot commit suicide be incapable of being farther useful to society  Depressed and gloomy as his state of mind was Mr Wilmot testified great satisfaction at our rencontre and the interest which I unfeignedly took in his welfare  soon revived all his former affection for me My veneration for his virtues love for his genius and pity for his misfortunes tended to calm his still fluttering and agitated spirits Unfortunate as he himself had been or at least had thought himself in his love of literature and poetry it yet gave him pleasure to find that the same passion was far from having abated in me He called it a bewitching illusion Turl affirmed it was a beneficial and noble propensity of soul  We none of us had a wish to separate for the imagination of each was teeming with that sedate yet full flow of sentiment which as Milton has so beautifully described melancholy can give Mr Wilmot had supposed his sister was guilty with the bishop and when I told her story with the addition of such probable circumstances as I myself had collected it afforded him very considerable  relief to find that the suspicions to which appearances gave birth had been false  I did not conceal the desire I had to know by what train of accidents he had been led into a state of such deep despondency and he thus kindly gratified my wish  HISTORY OF MR WILMOT  The narrative given by my sister which you Mr Trevor have already repeated precludes the necessity of any detail concerning my origin Nor is origin in my opinion of the least moment except as it displays the habits and growth of mind and shews how the man became such as we find him to be At what period of my existence that activity of inquiry and those energetic aspirings began which to me were afterward the source of the extremes of joy and sorrow I cannot tell but I believe the quality  of ardour though probably not born with us is either awakened in early infancy or seldom if ever attains strength and maturity I could not only read with uncommon accuracy and ease while very young but can remember I made efforts to reason with my father the major on what I read when I was little more than six years old  He though a man rather of irritable feelings than profound research was not destitute of literature and encouraged a propensity in me that was flattering to himself as the father of a boy remarked for his promising talents which talents he supposed might lead to distinctions that he had been unsuccessfully ambitious to obtain  He considered himself as one of the most unfortunate of men Imagining personal bravery to be the essence of the military character he had eagerly cherished that quality and having given incontestible proofs that he possessed it  in an eminent degree to be afterward overlooked was in his judgment too flagrant an instance of public as well as private ingratitude to be ever pardoned It was the daily subject of his thoughts and theme of his discourse and I have great reason to conjecture that the habitual discontent that preyed upon his mind and embittered his life especially the latter part of it communicated itself to me I was educated in the belief that the world is blind to merit continually suffers superior virtue to linger in indigence and neglect and is therefore an odious unjust and despicable world  I own I have at some few intervals doubted of this doctrine and supposed in conformity to your opinion Mr Turl that failure is rather the consequence of our own mistakes impatience and efforts ill directed than of society but the ill success of my own efforts aided perhaps by the prejudices which I received from my father have preponderated and  made me it may be too frequently incline to melancholy and misanthropy What can be said Are not the rich and powerful continually oppressing talents genius and virtue Is the general sense of mankind just in its decisions  Beside an appeal to the general sense of mankind is not always in our power and that the proceedings of individuals are often flagrantly unjust cannot be denied In the school where I was educated I was a frequent and painful witness of honours partially bestowed and prizes and applause awarded to others that were indubitably due to me When the rich and the powerful visited the seminary the sons of the rich and the powerful gained all their attention Conscious as I could not but be of my own superior claims I was overlooked  Perhaps I felt the repetition of these and similar acts of injustice too severely Yet are they not odious I own the remembrance of them ever has been and  is intensely painful and the pain is almost unremittingly prolonged by what every man who is not willfuly blind must daily see passing in the world Mr Wilmot sighed deeply Well well Would I could forget it  After many a bitter struggle in my boyish years to rise into notice few very few indeed of which were effectual I still continued the combat In due time as I was told my efforts were amply rewarded But how Instead of being forwarded in those more noble and beneficial pursuits for which I think I had proved myself fitted the effusions of genius though known were never once remembered Oh no I obtained with great difficulty and as an unmerited favour a charitable condescension of power that knew not very well if it ought to be so kind to a being so unprotected yes I obtainedthe office of usher The honour of mechanically hearing declensions conjugations and rules of  syntax and prosody repeated by beings who detested the labour to which they were compelled was conferred upon me beings who looked on me not as a benefactor but as a tyrant And tyrants all teachers indubitably are under our present modes of education  Humbled and cowed as my genius was by the drudgery and obscurity to which it was consigned I yet had the courage to continue those labours by which alone mind is brought to maturity Alive as I was to a sense of injustice I recollected that even if my powers were equal to all that I myself had fondly hoped from them there were examples of men with at least equal powers who had been equally ill treated Equally did I say Oh Otway Oh Chatterton What understandings what hearts had those men who without an effort without moving a finger not to do you justice of that they were incapable but to preserve you from famine could suffer  you to perish It was needless to repine I consoled and reconciled myself to my fate as well as I was able I pursued my studies read the poets of ancient and modern times with unabating avidity observed the actions and inquired into the motives of men and made unceasing attempts to develope the human heart  Excluded as it were by the pride luxury and caprice of the world from expanding my sensations and wedding my soul to society I was constrained to bestow the strong affections that glowed consciously within me upon a few My mother and sister had a large share of them To skreen them from the indigence obscurity and neglect to which without my aid they must be doomed was a hope that encouraged me in the bold project I had conceived  I determined to dedicate myself to literature poetry and particularly to the stage Essays of the dramatic kind indeed  had been made by me very early At length I undertook a tragedy as a work which if accomplished with the degree of perfection that I hoped it would be must at once establish my true rank in society relieve the wants of my family and be a passport for me to every man of worth and understanding in the world How little did I know the world Fond fool Over credulous idiot What cares the world for the toils and struggles the restless days and sleepless nights of the man of genius I am ashamed to think I could be so miserably mistaken  The ardour with which I began my work the deep consideration I gave to every character the strong emotions I felt while composing it the minute attention I paid to all its parts and the intense labour I bestowed in planning writing correcting and completing it were such as I believed must insure success  Surely mankind can be but little  ware of the uncommon anxieties pains and talents that must contribute to the production of such a work or their reception of it when completed would be very different They would not suffer surely they would not as they so frequently do this or that senseless blockhead to frustrate the labour of years blast the poet's hopes and render the birth of genius abortive  My tragedy at length was written and by some small number whose judgment I consulted was approved never indeed with that enthusiasm which I perhaps the overweening author imagined it must have excited but it was approved "I was a young man of some merit it was more than they had expected" Nay I have met with some liberal critics who have appeared modestly to doubt whether they themselves should have written better  Before I made the experiment I had supposed that every man whose wealth  or power gave him influence in society would start up the moment it was known that an obscure individual the usher of a school had written a tragedy not only to protect and produce it to the world but to applaud and honour the author Would secure him from the possibility of want load him with every token of respect and affectionately clasp him to their bosom The indifference and foolish halffaced kind of wonder as destitute of feeling as of understanding with which it was received by the persons on whom I had depended for approbation and support did more than astonish me it pained disgusted and jaundiced my mind  The only consolation I could procure was in supposing that the inhabitants of the city where I resided were deficient in literary taste and that at a more polished place where knowledge literature and poetry were more diffused I should meet a very different reception  Experience only can cure the unhackneyed mind of its erroneous estimates  London however and its far famed theatres were the objects at which my ambition long had aimed and thither after various doubts and difficulties it was decreed I should go The profits of my place I had dedicated to the relief of my family and my mother's great fear was that going up to London so ill provided I should perish there for want Of this I was persuaded there could be no danger and at length prevailed  The danger however was not quite so imaginary as I in the fervour of hope had affirmed it to be The plan I proposed was to get another usher's place in or near town till I could bring my piece upon the stage This I attempted and made various applications which all failed some because though I understood Greek I could not teach merchant's accounts or spoil paper by flourishes  and foppery which is called writing a fine hand and others because as I suppose persons offered themselves whose airs or humility or other usherlike qualifications that had no relation to learning pleased their employers better than mine  I soon grew weary of these degrading attempts and turned my thoughts to a more attractive resource While in the country I had frequently sent little fugitive pieces to be inserted in periodical publications and now on inquiry I found there were people who were paid for such productions I made the experiment and after a variety of fruitless efforts succeeded in obtaining half a guinea a week from an evening paper which I supplied with essays little poetical pieces and other articles much faster than they chose to print them  In the interim the grand object for which I had left the country was not neglected It is a common mistake to  imagine that to get a piece upon the stage it is necessary to procure a patron by whom it shall be recommended To this I was advised and in consequence of this advice wrote letters to three different persons whose rank in society I imagined would insure a reception at the theatre to the piece which they should protect I supposed that every such person who should hear of a poet who had written a tragedy would rejoice in the opportunity of affording him aid and instantly stand forth his patron  In this spirit I wrote my three letters and received no answer to any one of them Amazed at this I went to the houses of the great people I had addressed but my face was unknown Not one of them was at home I could gain no admission When now and then suffered to wait in the hall I saw dancingmasters buffoons gamblers beings of every species that could mislead the head and corrupt the heart come  and go without ceremony but to a poet all entrance was denied for such chosen society he was unfit The very rabble with which these pillared lounging places swarm looked on him with a suspicious and half contemptuous eye that insolently inquired what business had he there Were the slaves and menials of Maecenas such Was it thus at the Augustan court when the lord of the conquered world sat banqueting with Virgil on his right hand and Horace on his left  Why did I read and remember stories so seductive Why did I foolishly place all my happiness in the approbation of the great vulgar or the small forgetting that approbation neither adds to virtue nor diminishes Perhaps and indeed I fear my mind was warped Yet surely the neglect and even odium in which the unobtruding man of genius is at present overwhelmed is a damning accusation against the rich and titled great  It was long however before I entirely disdained these abject and fruitless efforts On one occasion I was fortunate enough as I absurdly thought to get introduced to a Marquis It was an awful honour to which I was unused and instead of addressing him with the frothy and impertinent levity which characterized his own manners and which he encouraged in the creatures that were admitted to his familiarity I stood confounded expecting he should have read my play which I had transcribed for his perusal have understood the value of the poet who could write it and have been anxious to relieve that acuteness of sensibility which overclouded and hid the man of genius in the timid abashed and too cowardly author He spoke to me indeed nay condescended to repeat two or three of the newest literary anecdotes that had been retailed to him from the bluestockingclub and then civilly dismissed me to give audience to a Dutch  birdfancier who had brought him a piping bulfinch But I saw him no more he was never afterward at home I was one of a class of animals that a Marquis never admits into his collec  ion My tragedy when applied for by letter was returned with 'sorrow that indispensible engagements had prevented him from reading it but requested a copy as soon as it should appear in print' For which should such a strange event have come to pass I suppose I should have been insulted with the gift perhaps of one guinea perhaps of five And thus a Marquis discharged a duty which his rank and power so well enabled him to perform But patience The word poet shall be remembered with everlasting honour when the title Marquis shallPshaw  On another occasion an actress who strange to tell happened very deservedly to be popular and whom before she arrived at the dignity of a London  theatre I had known in the country recommended me to a dutchess To this dutchess I went day after day and day after day was subjected for hours to the prying unmannered insolence of her countless lacquies This time she was not yet stirring though it was two o'clock in the afternoon the next she was engaged with an Italian vender of artificial flowers the day after the prince and the devil does not know who beside were with her and so on till patience and spleen were at daggers drawn  At last from the hall I was introduced to the drawingroom where I was half amazed to find myself Could it be real Should I after all see a creature so elevated so unlike the poor compendium of flesh and blood with which I crawled about the earth Why it was to be hoped that I should  Still she did not come and I stood fixed gazing at the objects around me longer perhaps than I can now well guess  The carpet was so rich that I was afraid my shoes would disgrace it The chairs were so superb that I should insult them by sitting down The sofas swelled in such luxurious state that for an author to breathe upon them would be contamination I made the daring experiment of pressing with a single finger upon the proud cushion and the moment the pressure was removed it rose again with elastic arrogance an apt prototype of the dignity it was meant to sustain Though alone I blushed at my own littleness  Two or three times the familiars of the mansion skipped and glided by me in at this door and out at that seeing yet not noticing me It was well they did not or I should have sunk with the dread of being mistaken for a thief that had gained a furtive entrance to load himself with some parcel of the magnificence that to poverty appeared so tempting  This time however I was not wholly disappointed I had a sight of the dutchess or rather a glimpse "Her carriage was waiting She had been so infinitely delayed by my lord and my lady and his highness and Signora Was exceedingly sorry Would speak to me another time tomorrow at three o'clock but had not a moment to spare at present and so vanished"  Shall I say she treated me proudly and made me feel my insignificance No The little that she did say was affable the tone was conciliating the eye encouraging and the countenance expressed the habitual desire of conferring kindness But these were only aggravating circumstances that shewed the desirableness of that intercourse which to me was unattainable I say to me for those who had a less delicate sense of propriety who were more importunate more intruding and whose forehead was proof against repulse were more successful By such  people she was besieged on such she lavished her favours till report said that she impoverished herself for a tale of distress whether feigned or real if obtruded upon her she knew not how to resist  What consolation was this to me I was not of the begging tribe I came with a demand at sight upon the understanding which whoever refused to pay disgraced themselves rather than the drawer  She mistook my character and the next day at three o'clock instead of seeing me herself sent me ten guineas in a note by her French maitre d'hotel which chinked as they slided from side to side and proclaimed me a pauper My heart almost burst with indignation Yet coward that I was I wanted the fortitude to refuse the polluted paper I thought it would be an affront and still fed myself with the vain hope of procuring from her that countenance  to my own labours which I imagined they deserved and which therefore I did not think it any disgrace to solicit The disgrace of reducing men of merit to such humiliating situations was not mine  I went twice more and was both times interrogated in French by the insolent maitre d'hotel so as to convince me that he thought my coming again so soon was a proof of no common degree of impudence  Oh Euripides Oh Sophocles Did not your sublime shades glide wrathful by and menace the wretch in whom your divine art had been so degraded How did I pray as I passed the scowling porter for the death of your great predecessor that some eagle would drop a tortoise on my head and instantly crush me to atoms  I had been the more anxious after patronage because I wished the actress whom I have mentioned to play my heroine There was no tragedian whose  powers were in the least comparable to hers But the difficulty of getting a piece on the stage at the theatre to which she belonged all the town told me was incredible It was a chancerysuit which no given time could terminate The manager was the most liberal of men the best of judges and the first of writers as void of envy as he was noble minded and friendly to merit Yes friendly in heart and act when he could be prevailed on to act But his rare virtues and gifts were rendered useless extinguished by the killing vice of procrastination He never listened to a story that he did not sympathize with the teller of it The request must be a wild one indeed which he did not feel an instant desire to grant He would promise with the most sincere and honest intentions to perform but hurried away by new petitioners or projects of a more grand and important nature he would with still greater facility forget All who  knew him uniformly affirmed a soul more expansive more munificent could not inhabit a human form yet from this one defect it was frequently his fate where he intended an essential benefit to commit an irreparable injury He encouraged hopes that were never realized retarded the merit he meant to promote and raised up personal enemies who impeded his own utility conspicuous and grand as this utility was and is it would otherwise have been unexampled  I speak the sentiments of men who I believe were incapable of exaggeration For my own part I have read his works and I love him almost to adoring  He is I know assaulted by an infinite number of affairs that all demand his attention Many of them are totally beneath it yet are undertaken by him with a too ready compliance averse as he is to give the solicitor pain and continually desirous to make every creature happy He can do but one thing at once Of  the multitude of things to be done not half are present to the memory at any one time and of those that are remembered what can he do but select the most urgent The mistake has often been rather in the too ready promise than in the nonperformance If prevented by serious occupation by love of the chosen companions of his convivial hours or by habits of forgetful revery from reading my tragedy and being just to me I attribute the neglect to its true cause which certainly was not jealousy of or indifference to the man of talents How can he honour merit granting it to exist with which he is unacquainted Yet let me not be misunderstood though I love his comprehensive benevolence of soul I wish it were less undistinguishingI cannot applaud or approve the errors into which it leads both himself and those he means to serve  In a word I could find no mode of securing his attention I endeavoured to  fix it by the intervention of the great who delighted in his social qualities did homage to his wit and were ambitious of his friendship But in these attempts I likewise failed  Hopeless therefore of aid from my favourite actress I sent my play to the other house How was I relieved after the delay I had endured and the continual anxiety in which I had been kept how delighted by hearing from the manager within a fortnight He appointed an interview received me with affability and immediately proceeded to the business in question  He began with telling me he could have wished I had rather turned my thoughts to the comic than the tragic muse for tragedy was less fashionable and consequently less profitable both to the house and the author than comedy or opera I sighed and answered it was an ill proof of public taste when it could receive greater pleasure from the unconnected  scenes of an opera than from the fable pathos and sublime emotions of tragedy But I feared the fault was less in the audience than in the poet and added that the first fortunate writer who should produce a tragedy such as had been written and such as I hoped it was possible again to write would find audiences not insensible to his merit  He replied it may be so▪ I can only answer that each author thinks himself the chosen bard you have described and that each is disappointed I am pleased Sir continued he with many parts of your tragedy but I think it has one great fault it is too tragical it rather excites horror than terror Whether the age be more refined or more captious more humanized or more effeminate than other ages have been I will not pretend to determine but you have written some scenes that would not at present be endured If you think proper to make such alterations as shall soften and adapt  them to the present taste and if I approve them when made your piece shall then be performed  I knew not what to reply The scenes to which he referred were conceived as I had imagined in the bold but true stile of tragedy I intended them to produce a great effect and was sorry to be informed as among other things I had been that ladies would faint fall into hysterics and be taken shrieking out of the boxes at hearing them I had no remedy but to submit reconsider and by lowering the tone of passion perhaps spoil my tragedy  Oh what a tormenting trade is that of author He that makes a chair a table or any common utensil brings his work home is paid for his labour and there his trouble ends It was quickly begun and quickly over it excited little hope but it met with no disappointment The author on the contrary has the labour of days months and years to  encounter When he begins his difficulties are immeasurable and while as he proceeds they seem to disappear nay at the very moment when he sometimes thinks them all conquered he discovers that they are but accumulated Every part every page every period have been considered and reconsidered with unremitting anxiety He has revised rewritten corrected expunged again produced and again erased with endless iteration Points and commas themselves have been settled with repeated and jealous solicitude  At length as he thinks his labour is over He knows indeed that no work of man was ever perfect but circumstanced as he is the eager prying of his own sleepless eye cannot discover what more to amend He produces the tedious fruits of incessant fatigue to the world and hopes the harvest will be in proportion to the unwearied and extreme care he has bestowed Poor man  Mistaken mortal How could he imagine that the sensations of multitudes should all correspond with his own Educated in schools so various under circumstances so contradictory and prejudices so different and distinct how could he suppose his mind was the common measure of man Faultless Perfect Vain supposition Extravagant hope The driver of a millhorse he who never had the wit to make much less to invent a mousetrap will detect and point out his blunders All satisfied No not one Not a man that reads but will detail reprove and ridicule his dull witted errors  Well he finds he is mistaken he pants after improvement and listens to advice He follows it alters and again appears What is his success Are cavilers less numerous Absurd expectation Do critics unite in its praise Ridiculous hope If he would escape censure  he must betake himself to a very different trade  It was the month of February when my tragedy was returned The season was far advanced I had then been nearly twelve months held in suspence seeking the means of appearing before the public soliciting patronage and indulging hope My mother and sister depended much on my aid Out of the small pittance which the newspaper essays afforded I at first made a proportionate deduction and lived that is contrived to exist on the remainder  This could not long endure and I sought other channels of emolument I wrote a novel which I hawked about among the booksellers Some of them printed nothing in that way others would venture to publish it and share the profits but not advance a shilling One of them offered me five guineas for the two volumes and told me it was a  great price for he seldom gave more than three  At last I was fortunate enough to obtain double the sum It was printed but being written in haste and in a state of mind entirely adverse to that fine flow which is the token the test and the triumph of genius its success was less than I expected Still however it more than answered the hopes of the bookseller and I think I may safely affirm it had marks of mind sufficient to excite applause mingled with the censure of just criticism  Did it obtain this applause No "A vulgar narrative or uninteresting incidents" was the laconic character given of it in that monthly publication in which from its reputed impartiality I most hoped for just and candid inquiry  Finding what a terrible animal a critic is I determined to become one myself I made the first essay of my talents  for censure on such books as I could borrow and sent my remarks to the magazines into which they were immediately admitted  Thus encouraged I applied to the publisher of a new review and informed him of my course of reading and of the languages and sciences with which I was acquainted My proposal was graciously received and I was admitted of that corps which has certainly done much good and much harm to literature  I entered on my new office with great determination but I soon discovered that to a man of principle who dare neither condemn nor approve a book he has not read it was a very unproductive employment It is the custom of the trade to pay various kinds of literary labour by the sheet and this among the rest Thus it frequently happened that a book which would demand a day to peruse was not worthy of five lines of animadversion  This is the true source of feeble and false criticism a task in itself most difficult and to which the chosen few alone are equal Deep investigation scientific acquirement an acute and comprehenhensive mind a correct and invigorating stile an intelligence superior to prejudice and an undeviating conscientious spirit of rectitude are the rare endowments it requires Its seat should be the summit of mental attainment for its office is to enlighten It has to instruct genius itself and its powers should be equal to the hardy enterprise In fine its object ought to be the love of truth it is the lust of gain I need not expatiate on the consequences they are selfevident  Poor as the trade is I exercised it with the scrupulous assiduity of which I I knew it to be worthy My labour therefore was as great as my emoluments were trifling and though I made no progress toward fame and fortune my  efforts were unremitting I mention these circumstances to shew that my failure in my attempts to gain what I believe to be my true rank in society did not originate either in indolence want of oeconomy or any other neglect of mine Day or night I was scarcely ever without either a book or a pen in my hand With the most sedulous industry and caution I endeavoured to render justice as well to the works of others as to my own My uniform study was to increase knowledge diffuse good taste and as I fondly hoped promote the gegeneral pleasure and happiness of mankind  But while I was anxiously caring for all no one seemed to care for me I and my learning taste and genius if I possessed them wandered through the croud unnoticed or noticed only to be scorned insulted by the vulgar for the something in my manner which pretended to distinguish me from themselves  and contemned by the proud and the prosperous because of the forlorn poverty of my appearance Among the fashionable and the fortunate where I might have hoped to find urbanity and the social polish of a civilized nation I could gain no admittance for I had no title kept no carriage and was no sycophant The doors of the learned were shut upon me for they were doctors or dignitaries in church physic or law Of science they were all satisfied they had enough of profit promotion and the other good things of which they were in full pursuit I had none to give By my presence they would have been retarded offended at the freedom of my conversation and by my friendship disgraced They sought other and far different associates  Bowed to the earth as I was by this soulkilling injustice and wearied by these incessant toils I still did not neglect my tragedy for an hour I considered and  reconsidered the objections that had been made I was convinced they were ill founded but I was not left to the exercise of my own judgment I had no alternative To lower the tone of passion was in my opinion to injure my tragedy but it must be done or must not be performed The manager urged arguments that were and perhaps could not but be satisfactory to any man in his situation his experience of public taste was long and confirmed the nightly expences of a theatre made it a most serious concern the risk of every new piece was great for the town was capricious To obtain all possible security against risk therefore was a duty  The reluctance with which alterations were made occasioned them to be rather slow At last however I finished them as much to my own satisfaction as could under such circumstances be expected and a fair copy written as all  the copies made of it were with my own hand was again sent to the manager  A week longer than in the former instances elapsed before I heard from him and when I did hear the substance of his letter was that he had a new comedy in preparation which it being then the middle of March would entirely fill up the remainder of the season  What could I do No blame was imputable to him for the delay It was no fault of his that I was pursued by the malice of poverty that I was tormented with the desire of effectually relieving the necessities of my family that I had written to my mother and sister in the elated moment of hope an assurance of being able to grant this relief in a very few weeks and that buoyed up by these calculations I had indulged myself in procuring a suit of clothes and other necessaries of which I was in extreme need on credit  Thou world of vice thou ironhearted senseless mass of madness and folly why did I ever dream that I had the power to arrest thy headlong course and fix thy bewildered wits thy garish idiot eye on me On my weak efforts my humble wishes my craving wants What signs of luxury what tokens of dissipation what innumerable marks of extravagant waste did I every where see around me at the moment that poverty was thus pinching me to the very bone Here a vain mortal as insolent as uninstructed drawn by six ponies with a postillion before and three idle fellows behind pampered in vice that he might thus openly insult common sense and thus publicly proclaim the folly of his head to be as egregious as the insensibility of his heart was hateful There trifling and imbecile creatures who not satisfied with the appellation woman call themselves ladies and expend thousands  on their routs maskedballs whipped creams and other froth and frippery procured from the achs and pains and blood and bones of the poor Wretches more bent and weighed down by misery than even I was  What need I to recall such pictures to your imaginations Can you look abroad and not behold them Are not the vices of unequal distribution to be met with in every corner nook and alley Is not the despotism of wealth that is of that property which the folly of man so much reveres and worships every where visible Does it not varnish vice generate crime and trample virtue and the virtuous in the dust Is the deep sense which I have entertained of the relentless injustice of society all false  Impelled as I was by paltry yet pressing wants and debts that would admit of no delay I sought relief in endeavouring to raise money on the presumptive  profits of my tragedy What can the wretch who is thus besieged thus hunted do but yield I had promised aid to my family and depending on that promise which had been much too confidently given my mother was in danger of having her trifling effects seized my sister whom I then tenderly loved of being turned loose perhaps into the haunts of infamy and myself of being thrown into a loathsome prison  My first attempt was a very wild one and proved how little I yet knew of mankind I wrote a letter to a woman of great fame in the literary world the reputed writer of a work the praises of which had been often echoed and whose wealth was immense To such a person I thought the appeal I had to make must come with resistless force For a man of literature a poet capable of writing a tragedy that had already been deemed worthy at least of attention from the theatre and of the merits of which she  so well could judge for such a man she would be all kindness all sensibility all soul What an incurable dolt was I Thus repeatedly to degrade the character of bard and thus too in vain I blush No matter  I minutely detailed the circumstances of my case to this female leader of literature and assiduously endeavouring to avoid every feature of meanness requested the loan of one hundred pounds appealing for the probability of reimbursement to her own conceptions of the rectitude of the mind that could produce the tragedy I sent and which I requested her first to read She herself would judge of the danger there might be of its condemnation If she thought it would fail I then should be anxious that she should run no risk but if not the loan would be a most essential benefit to me and perhaps a pleasure to herself  Fool that I was thus to estimate ladies' pleasures Whether she did or did  not read my play I never knew but this learned lady this patroness of letters this beprosed and berhymed dowager who professed to be the enraptured lover of poetry wit and genius returned it with a formal cold apology that was insulting by its affected pity 'She was  extremely  sorry to be obliged to refuse me  extremely  sorry indeed It would have given her  infinite  pleasure to have advanced me the sum I required but she was then building a  fine  house which demanded all the money she could  possibly  spare'  Why ay She must have a fine house with fifty fine rooms in it fortynine of which were useless while I my mother my sister and millions more might perish without a hovel in which to shelter our heads  Convinced at last of the futility of applications like these I sought an opposite resource If men would not lend money to benefit me they would perhaps to benefit themselves One of the  actors with whom I became acquainted informed me that there was a Jew who frequented all theatrical haunts knew I had a play in the manager's hands and might possibly be induced to lend me the sum I wanted To this Jew I addressed myself stated the merits of the case and fearful of making too high a demand requested a loan of seventy pounds  His first question was concerning the security I had to give I had none The Jew shook his head and told me it was impossible to lend money without security I replied that if making over the profits of my tragedy to the amount of the principal and interest would but satisfy him to that I should willingly consent Again he shrugged his shoulders and repeated it was very dangerous Jews themselves kind as they were could not lend money without security Beside money was never so scarce as just at that moment Indeed he had no such  sum himself but he had an uncle in Duke's Place who if I could but get good  personal  security would supply me on paying a premium adequate to the risk  I must avoid being too circumstantial I urged every incitement my imagination could honestly suggest he pretended to state the matter to his uncle The affair was kept in suspence and I was obliged to travel to Duke's Place at least a dozen times but at last I gave my bond for a hundred pounds for which I received fifty and paid two guineas out of it on the demand of the nephew for the trouble he had taken in negociating the business the uncle being the ostensible person with whom it was transacted  Determined to secure my mother from want as far as was in my power I remitted the whole sum to her except what was necessary to pay my immediate debts and blessed the Jew extortioner  as a man who compared to the learned lady abounded in the milk of human kindness  By the continuance of my literary drudgery the time passed away to the middle of September the season at which the winter theatres usually open I now felt tenfold anxiety concerning my tragedy The bond I had given at six mouths would soon become due failure would send me to prison perhaps for life it would disgrace me would distract my family would cut short my hopes of fame and the grand progress which I sometimes fondly imagined I should make Every way it would be fatal I trembled at its possibility Success which had so lately appeared certain seemed to become more and more dubious  During the summer I had heard nothing from the manager I now inquired at the theatre and was told he was at Bath and would not be in town  in less than a fortnight I waited with increasing fears haunted the playhouse and teazed the attendants at it with my inquiries Of these I soon perceived not only the sneers but the duplicity for when the manager was returned to town and as I was told by a performer was actually in the theatre they affirmed the contrary He had been but was gone I plainly read the lie in their looks to each other At that time it was new to me and gave me great pain but I soon became accustomed though never reconciled to their manners which were characterized by that low cunning that supercilious mixture of insolence and meanness that is always detested by the honest and the open A set ofPshaw They are unworthy my remembrance  Finding the manager was now returned I immediately wrote to him and a meeting was appointed three days after at the theatre He then informed me there were still some few alterations  which he was desirous should be immediately made after which the tragedy should be put into rehearsal and performed in about three weeks  This was happy news to me I returned with an elated heart to make the proposed corrections finished them the same day and again delivered the piece into the manager's hands He proceeded with a punctuality that delighted me the parts were cast and the performers called to the theatre to hear it read  This was a new scene a new trial of patience a new degradation Instead of that steady attention from my small audience which I expected that deep interest which I supposed the story must inspire suffusing them in tears or transfixing them in terror the ladies and gentlemen amused themselves with whispers winks jokes titters and giggling which when they caught my attention and fixed my eye upon the laughers were turned  into an affected gravity that added to the insult No heart panted no face turned pale no eye shed a tear and if I were to judge from this experiment a more uninteresting soulless piece had never been written But the manager was not present and I was not a person of  quence enough to command respect  ceremony from any party I complained to him of the total want of effect in my tragedy over the passions of the actors but he treated that as a very equivocal sign indeed and of no worth  There was another circumstance of which he informed me that to him and as it afterward proved to me was of a much more serious nature They had not been altogether so inattentive as I had imagined Amid their monkey tricks and common place foolery their hearts had been burning with jealousy of each other Neither men nor women were satisfied with their parts I had three male and two female characters of  great importance in the play but rising in gradation Of the first of these all the actors were ambitious and one of them who knew his own consequence and that the manager could not carry on the business of the theatre at that time without him threw up his part  In vain did I plead write and remonstrate No reasons no motives of generosity or of justice to the manager the piece or the public could prevail and his aid though most essential could not be obtained Had the part been totally beneath his abilities his plea would have been good but it was avowedly in the manager's opinion and in the opinion of every other performer superior to half of those he nightly played That it could have disgraced or injured him partiality itself could not affirm  And is the poet after having spent a life in that deep investigation of the human heart which alone can enable him  to write a play whose efforts must be prodigious and if he succeed his pathos wit and genius rare is he after all his struggles to be at the mercy of an ignorant actor or actress who so far from deeply studying the sense frequently do not remember the words they ought to repeat  Every  mister  is discontented with the character allotted him each envies the other and mutters accusations against both author and manager Sir won't speak the prologue it is not in his way and Madam will have the epilogue or she will positively throw up her part One gentleman thinks his dialogue too long and heavy and t'other too short and trifling This fine lady refuses to attend rehearsals another comes but has less of the spirit of the author at the fifth repetition than she had at the first Of their parts individually they know but very little of the play as a whole they are absolutely ignorant On the  first representation by which the reputation of a play is decided they are so confused and imperfect owing partly to their imbecility but more still to their indolence that the sense of the author is mutilated his characters travestied and his piece rather burlesqued than performed The reality of the scene depends on the passions excited in the actor listening almost as essentially as in the actor speaking but at the end of each speech the player supposes his part is over the arms attitude and features all sink into insignificance and have no more meaning than the face of Punch when beating Joan  Of the reality of this picture I soon had full proof My tragedy after a number of rehearsals during which all these vexatious incidents and many more were experienced by me was at length performed To say that the applause it received equalled my expectations would be false but it greatly exceeded  the expectations of others It was materially injured by the want of the actor who had refused his part The reigning vice of recitation which since the death of Garrick has again prevailed injured it more The tide of passion which should have rushed in torrents and burst upon the astonished ear was sung out in slow and measured syllables with a monotonous and funeral cadence painful in its motion and such as reminded me of the Sloth and his horrid cry plaintive indeed but exciting strange disgust  My success however was thought extraordinary The actors when the play was over swarmed into the greenroom to congratulate me The actresses were ready to kiss me good natured souls The greenroom loungers newspaper critics authors and pretended friends of the house flocked round me to wish me joy and stare at that enviable animal a successful poet One of them himself an approved writer of comedy  offered me five hundred pounds for the profits of my piece and as far as money was concerned I thought my fortune was made doubts and difficulties were fairly over and the reward of all my toils was at last secure Sanguine blockhead thus everlastingly to embitter my own cup of sorrow Secure Oh no The nectar of hope was soon dashed from my lips  I must detail the causes of this reverse they were various and decisive  It had been the custom on the appearance of every new play to give it what is called a run that is to perform it without intermission as many nights as the house should continue to be tolerably filled The managers of both theatres had at this time deemed the practice prejudicial and determined to reform it Of this reform I was the victim My play was the first that appeared after the resolution had been taken and in the bills of the day which announced the performance of my tragedy for the Saturday  evening the public were advertised that another piece would be acted on Monday Ignorant of the true reason the town misinterpreted this notice into an avowal that no favourable expectations were formed of my tragedy and as the author was an obscure person whose name was totally unknown to the world none of that public curiosity on which popularity depends was excited  This was but one of the damning causes My play appeared about the middle of October when the season continued to be fine the citizens were all at the watering places the court was at Windsor the parliament had not met and the town was empty  To add to all this one of the performers was taken ill on the second night Another or them thought proper to ride over to Egham races on the third where he got drunk and absented himself from the theatre so that substitutes were obliged to be found for both the parts In  fine though some few struck as they affirmed with the merits of the play were just enough to attempt to bring it into public esteem it gradually sunk into neglect My third night after paying the expences of the house produced me only twenty pounds On the sixth night the receipts were less than the charges and it was played no more The overplus of the third night was little more than sufficient to defray the deficiencies of the sixth and thus vanished my golden dreams of profit prosperity and fame  The evil did not rest here I was in danger of all the misfortunes I had foreseen from the Jew and the bond There was not only hardship and severity but injustice in my case and I determined to remonstrate to the manager My mind was sore and my appeal was spirited but proper it was an appeal to his equity  He listened to me acknowledged I had been unfortunate and said that  though the theatre could not and ought not to be accountable for my loss yet some compensation he thought was justly my due He therefore gave me a draft on his treasurer for one hundred pounds and wished me better success in future  This it is true was of the most essential service to me it relieved me not only from imprisonment but from the degradation of having my honesty questioned It did not however restore me to the hope that should have rouzed me to greater exertions  Some new efforts indeed I was obliged to make for the time consumed in revising my tragedy and attending rehearsals had occasioned me to neglect other pursuits and I was again some few pounds in debt No dread of labour no degree of misery could induce me to leave these debts unpaid I therefore worked and starved till they were all discharged after which  I returned to the country and became usher at the school where I first knew you Mr Trevor  To paint the family distresses that succeeded the disgrace the infamy that attended them the wretchedness that afterward preyed upon me till I could endure no more were needless I was satisfied that I had a right to end a state of suffering and to be rid of a world that considers itself as burthened not benefited by such creatures as I am At torments after death concerning which bigotry and cunning have invented such horrid fables accusing and blaspheming a God whom they pretend to adore of tyranny the most monstrous and injustice the most abhorred at tales like these I laughed  You Mr Turl say you can shew me better arguments moral motives that are indispensable why I ought to live These are assertions of which I must consider You have restored me to life  prove that you have done me a favour Of that I doubt My first sensation after recovering my faculties was anger at your officious pity shew me that it was ill timed and unjust If you have reduced me to the necessity of again debating the same painful and gloomy question if you cannot give that elasticity to my mind which will animate it to despise difficulty and steel it against injustice however good your intentions may have been I fear you have but imposed misery upon me  CHAP X REMARKS ON THE MISTAKES OF MR WILMOT BY TURL LAW OR IMPORTANT TRUTHS DISCUSSED TO WHICH FEW WILL ATTEND FEWER WILL UNDERSTAND AND VERY FW INDEED WILL BELIEVE  THE state of mind into which his mistakes had brought him rendered Wilmot an object of compassion The tone in  which he concluded testified the alarming errors into which he was still liable to fall For this reason though Turl treated him with all possible humanity and tenderness he considered it as dangerous to him and scarcely less so to me on whom he perceived the strong impression the narrative had made to be silent With a voice and countenance therefore of perfect urbanity he thus replied  'Do not imagine Mr Wilmot that I have not been deeply penetrated by your sufferings that I am insensible of your uncommon worthy or that I approve the vices of society and the injustice and unfeeling neglect with which you have been treated Thousands are at this moment subject to the same oppression  'But the province of wisdom is not to lament over our wrongs it is to find their remedy Querulous complaint Pardon me if my words or expressions have any illtimed severity indeed that  is far from my intention Querulous complaint is worthy only of the infancy of understanding The world is unjust and why Because it is ignorant Ought that to excite either complaint or anger Would not the energies of intellect be more worthily employed in removing the cause by the communication of knowledge  'You bid me restore the elasticity of your mind Can you look round on the follies and mistakes of men which you have the power to detect expose and in part reform and be in want of motive You demand that I should communicate to you the desire of life Can you have a perception of the essential duties that you are fitted to perform and dare you think of dying  'You have been brooding over your own wrongs which your distorted fancy has painted as perhaps the most insufferable in the whole circle of existence How could you be so blind Look at  the mass of evil by which you are surrounded What is its origin Ignorance Ignorance is the source of all evil and there is one species of ignorance to which you and men like you have been egregiously subject ignorance of the true mode of exercising your rare faculties ignorance of their unbounded power of enjoyment  'You have been persuaded that this power was destroyed by the ridiculous distinctions of rich and poor Oh mad world Monstrous absurdity Incomprehensible blindness Look at the rich In what are they happy In what do they excel the poor Not in their greater stores of wealth which is but a source of vice disease and death but in a little superiority of knowledge a trifling advance toward truth How may this advantage be made general Not by the indulgence of the desires you have fostered the tendency of which was vicious but by retrenching those  false wants that you panted to gratify and thus by giving leisure to the poor or rather to all mankind to make the acquirement of knowledge the grand business of life  'This is the object on which the attention of every wise man should be turned He that by precept or example shall prevail on community to relinquish one superfluous dish one useless and contemptible trapping will be the general friend of man He who labours for riches to countenance by his practice their abuse is labouring to secure misery to himself and perpetuate it in society Who ought to be esteemed the most rich He whose faculties are the most enlarged How wealthy were you had you but known it at the moment your mind was distracting itself by these dirges of distress  'He that would riot in luxury let him wait the hour of appetite and carry his morsel into the harvest field There  let him seat himself on a bank eat and cast his eyes around Then while he shall appease the cravings of hunger not pamper the detestable caprice of gluttony let him remember how many thousands shall in like manner be fed by the plenty he every where beholds How poor and pitiable a creature would he be were his pleasure destroyed or narrowed because the earth on which it was produced was not what he had absurdly been taught to call his own  'You complain that the titled and the dignified rejected your intercourse How could you thus mistake your true rank How exalted was it compared to the ridiculous arrogance you envied Were you now visiting Bedlam would you think yourself miserable because its mad inhabitants despised you for not being as mighty a monarch as each of themselves But little depth of penetration is necessary to perceive that the lunatics  around us are no less worthy of our laughter and our pity  'If I do not mistake you Mr Trevor are hurrying into the very errors that have misled your noble minded friend and instructor Your active genius is busying itself how to obtain those riches and distinctions on which you have falsely supposed happiness depends You are in search of a profession by which your fortune is to be made Beware Notwithstanding that I am frequently assaulted by the same kind of folly myself I yet never recollect it without astonishment'  While Turl confined the application of his precepts to Wilmot I listened and assented with scarcely a doubt but the moment he directed them against me I turned upon him with all the force to which by my passions and fears I was rouzed  'What' said I 'would you persuade me to renounce those pursuits by which  alone I can gain distinction and respect in society Would you have me remain in poverty and thus relinquish the dearest portion of existence  Olivia was full in my thoughts as I spoke  'Of what worth would life be were I so doomed Rather than accept it on such terms were there ten thousand Serpentine rivers I would drown in them all'  Turl glanced significantly first at me and then at Wilmot 'Do you consider the danger the possible consequences of the doctrine you are now inculcating Mr Trevor'  Too much devoured by passion to attend to his reproof in the sense he meant it I retorted in a still louder key 'I can discover no ill consequences in being sincere I repeat were there millions of seas I would sooner drown in them all You are continually pushing your philosophy to extremes Mr Turl'  'You should rather say Mr Trevor  you are pushing your want of philosophy to an extreme  'The self denial you require is not in the nature of man'  'The nature of man is a senseles jargon Man is that which he is made by the various occurrences to which he is subjected Those occurrences continually differ no two men therefore were ever alike But how are you to obtain the wealth and dignity you seek By honest means'  'Can you suppose me capable of any other'  'Alas How universal how dangerous are the mistakes of mankind Your hopes are childish The law I understand is your present pursuit Do you suppose it possible to practise the law in any form and be honest'  'SirMr Turl You amaze me Where is the dishonesty of pleading for the oppressed'  'How little have you considered the  subject How ignorant are you of the practice of the law Oppressed Do counsel ever ask who is the oppressed Do they refuse a brief because the justice of the case is doubtful Do they not always inquire not what is justice but what is law Do they not triumph most and acquire most fame when they can gain a cause in the very teeth of the law they profess to support and revere Who is the greatest lawyer Not he who can most enlighten but he who can most perplex and confound the understanding of his hearers He who can best browbeat and confuse witnesses and embroil and mislead the intellect of judge and jury Yet the mischiefs I have mentioned are but the sprouts and branches of this tree of evil its root is much deeper it is in the law itself and in the system of property of which law is the support'  'Pshaw These are the distempered dreams of reform run mad'  'Are they Consider Beware of the mischief of deciding rashly Beware of your passions that are alarmed lest they should be disappointed'  'It is you that decide Prove this rooted evil of law'  'Suppose me unable to prove it are its consequences the less real But I will endeavour  'He who is told that "to do justice is to conduce with all his power to the well being of the whole" has a simple intelligible rule for his conduct  'He on the contrary who is told that "to do justice is to obey the law" has to inquire not what is justice but what is the law Now to know the law were it practicable would be not only to know the statutes at large by rote but all the precedents and all the legal discussions and litigations to which the practitioners of law appeal Innumerable volumes filled with innumerable subtleties and incoherencies and written  in a barbarous and unintelligible jargon must be studied Memory is utterly inadequate to the task and reason revolts spurns at and turns from it with loathing  'A short statement of facts will in my opinion demonstrate that law in its origin and essence is absolutely unjust  'To make a law is to make a rule by which a certain class of future events shall be judged  'Future events can only be partially and imperfectly foreseen  'Consequently the law must be par+tial and imperfect  'Let us take the facts in another point of viewThe law never varies  'The cases never agree  'The law is general  'The case is individual  'The penalty of the law is uniform  'The justice or injustice of the case is continually different  'To prejudge any case that is to give a decided opinion on it while any of the circumstances remain unknown is unjust even to a proverb Yet this is precisely what is done by making a law'  'This is strange doctrine Mr Turl'  'Disprove the facts Mr Trevor They are indisputable and on them the following syllogism may indisputably be formed  'To make a law is publicly to countenance and promote injustice  'Publicly to countenance and promote injustice is a most odious and pernicious action  'Consequently to make a law is a most odious and pernicious action  'How unlimited are the moral misc  efs that result To make positive laws is to turn the mind from the inquiry into what is just and compel it to inquire what is law  'To make positive laws is to habituate  and reconcile the mind to injustice by stamping injustice with public approbation  'To make positive laws is to deaden the mind to that constant and lively sense of what is just and unjust to which it must otherwise be invariably awake by not only encouraging but by obliging it to have recourse to rules founded in falsehood  'Each case is law to itself that is each case ought to be decided by the justice or the injustice arising out of the circumstances of that individual case and by no other case or law whatever for the reason I have already given that there never were nor ever can be two cases that were not different from each other  'I therefore once more warn you Mr Trevor that law is a pernicious mass of errors and that the practitioners of it can only thrive by the mischiefs which they themselves produce  the falsehoods they propagate and the miseries they inflict'  'This would be dangerous doctrine to the preacher were it heard in Westminster hall'  'I am sorry for it I am sorry that man can be in danger from his fellow men because he endeavours to do them good'  CHAP XI PAINFUL MEDITATIONS A NEW PROJECT FOR ACQUIRING WEALTH A JOURNEY TO BATH  THAT the reader may judge of the arguments of Turl I have been anxious to state them simply and not perplexed with the digressions commentaries cavils and violent opposition they met with from me Striking as they did at the very root of all my promised pleasures how could I listen and not oppose Destroying as they did all my towering  hopes at a breath what could I do but rave When my arguments and my anger were exhausted I sat silent for a while sunk in melancholy revery At length I recovered myself so far as to endeavour to console Mr Wilmot offer him▪ every assistance in my power and persuade him to an interview with his sister Aided by the benevolent arguments of Turl this purpose was with some little difficulty effected and I returned home to relate to Miss Wilmot what had happened  In very bitterness of soul I then began to meditate on the prospect before me The sensations I experienced were at some moments agonizing Could I even have renounced fame and fortune and patiently have resigned myself to live in obscure poverty yet to live as in such a case I must do without Olivia would be misery to which no arguments could induce me to submit But how obtain her Where were all my bright visions  fled Poor Wilmot What an example did he afford of ineffectual struggles talents neglected and genius trampled in the dust Was there more security for me Turl indeed seemed to resign himself without a murmur and to be happy in despite of fate But he had no Olivia to regret If he had happiness without her would be impossible  To attempt to repeat all the tormenting fears that hurried and agitated my mind on this occasion were fruitless Suffice it to say this was one of those severe conflicts to which by education and accident I was subject and it was not the least painful part of the present one that I could come to no decision  I persuaded myself indeed that with respect to law Turl's reasoning was much too severe and absolute It was true I could not but own that law was inclined to debase and corrupt the morals of its practitioners but surely there were exceptions and if I pursued the  law why should not I be one of them If therefore the happiness at which I aimed were attainable by this means I asserted to myself that I had heard no reasons which ought to deter me from practising the law  In the mean time I had conceived a project that related to the immediate state of my feelings the acuteness of which I was obliged to seek some method to appease Olivia was gone to Bath with her aunt and thither I was determined to follow her  Full of this design I dispatched Philip with orders that a post chaise should be ready at the door by nine o'clock the next morning after which to rid myself as much as possible of the thoughts that haunted me I once more went in search of the false Belmont  I found him at the usual place engaged at play The betting was high he appeared to be overmatched and for a few games his antagonist who like  himself was a first rate player triumphed My passions were always of the touchwood kind Rouzed and tempted by the bets that were so plentifully offered the thought suddenly occurred how possible it was for a man of penetration who could keep himself perfectly cool as I was persuaded I could What was there indeed that I persuaded myself I could not do to make a fortune by gambling I did not indeed call it by the odious term gambling it was calculation foresight acuteness of discernment My morality was fast asleep so intent was I on profiting by this new and surprisingly certain source of wealth and so avaricious of the means that at a glance seemed to promise the gratification of all my desires  I had not frequented a billiard table without having exercised my own skill learned the odds and obtained a tolerable knowledge of the game itself So fixed was my cupidity on its object that  I began with the caution of a blackleg made a bet and the moment the odds turned in my favour secured myself by taking them hedged again as the advantage changed and thus made myself a certain winner I ex  lted in my own clearness of perception and wondered that so palpable a method of winning should escape even an idiot  The experience however of a few games taught me that my discovery was not quite of so lucrative a nature as I had supposed The odds did not every game vary from side to side people were not always inclined to bet the odds and if I would run no great risk I even found it necessary to bet them sometimes myself Every man who has made the experiment knows that the thirst of lucre when thus awakened in a young mind is insatiable impetuous and rash I was weary of petty gains and riches by retail The ardour with which I examined the players and each  circumstance as it occurred persuaded me that there were tokens by which an acute observer might discover the winning party I had on former occasions remarked that players but rarely win game and game alternately even when they leave off equal but that success has a tide with a kind of periodical ebb and flow This said I may be attributed to the temper of the players the loser is too angry to attend with sufficient caution to his game he persuades himself that luck is against him strikes at random and does mischief every stroke After a while the winner grows careless loses a game and becomes angry and conquered in turn  Exulting in my prodigious penetration and fortified in my daring by reasoning so deep I determined to hedge no more bets Belmont whose notice my sudden rage for betting had by no means escaped was at this time losing and I was backing his antagonist To one of the bets  I offered he said 'Done' and though I felt a reluctance to win his money it seemed ungentleman like to refuse I won the three first bets and exulting in my own acuteness and certainty intreated him in pity to desist He refused and I pleaded the pain I felt at winning the money of a friend Beside it was not only dishonourable but dishonest it was absolutely picking his pocket  My triumph was premature From this time fortune veered and he began to win I was then willing to have taken the other side but could not procure a bet He bantering bade me not be afraid of winning my friend's money it was neither dishonourable dishonest nor picking his pocket Piqued by his sarcasms I continued till I had lost five and twenty guineas and then my vexation and pride which almost fo  med at the suspicion of my own folly made me propose to bet double or quit I lost  again again resorted to the same desperate remedy and met with the same ill success My frenzy was such that I a third time urged him to continue Fortunately for me his antagonist would play no more and I was left to reflect that my calculations and avaricious arts to rob fools and outwit knaves were as crude as they were contemptible  Wrung as I was to the heart I was ashamed or having it supposed that the loss of my hundred guineas in the least affected me Belmont insisted that I should sup with him and when I attempted to decline his invitation bantered me out of my refusal by asking if I had parted with my hundred guineas to purchase the spleen During supper I informed him of my intended journey to Bath and he immediately proposed to accompany me telling me that he had himself had the same intention On this we accordingly agreed and I left him early and retired to bed but not  to rest The quick decay of my small substance the helpless state in which I found myself the impatience with which I desired wealth and power and the increasing distance at which I seemed to be thrown from Olivia by this last act of folly kept me not only awake but in a fever of thought  The next day we set off and arrived at Bath the same evening where the first inquiries I made were at the Pumproom to learn where Olivia and her aunt were lodged So inconsiderate and eager were my desires that I endeavoured to obtain apartments in the same house but ineffectually they were all let I was recommended to others however in Milsomstreet in which I fixed my abode There was not room for Belmont and he got lodgings on the South Parade  CHAP XII DESPERATE MEASURES OLIVIA AND HER AUNT A RASH ACCUSATION AND ITS STRANGE CONSEQUENCES AFFAIRS BROUGHT TO A CRISIS  BEFORE I proceed to the history of my Bath adventures it is necessary to take a brief retrospect of the state of my affairs The total of my expences from the time that I received the four hundred and fifty pounds of Thornby to my arrival at Bath was about two hundred and forty pounds including the sum I had lost at billiards the money I had paid for printing my pamphlet the last sheet of which I corrected before I left town thirty pounds that in consequence of a letter from my mother I remitted to her and twenty for the purchase of a lottery ticket for among other absurd  and vicious ways of becoming rich that suggested itself to my eager fancy  The quick decay of my very small inheritance lay corroding at my heart and prompted me to a thousand different schemes without the power of determining me to any My general propensity however was more to the desperate which should at once be decisive than to the slow and lingering plans of timid prudence In reality both seemed hopeless and therefore the briefest suffering was the best At some short intervals the glow of hope which had lately been so fervid would return and those powers of thought that seemed to be struggling within me would promise great and glorious success but these were only flashes of lightening darting through a midnight sky the texture of which was deep obscurity "darkness visible"  To one point however I was fixed that of using every endeavour to learn  the true sentiments of Olivia respecting me and if any possible opportunity offered of declaring my own To effect this I resolved since I knew not what better method to take that I would watch the few public places to which all the visitors at Bath resort I therefore immediately subscribed to the upper and lower rooms and traversed the city in every direction  People not confined to their chamber are here sure to be soon met with and on the second morning after my arrival I discovered Olivia seated at the farther end of the Pumproom She had an old lady who proved to be her aunt by her side and a circle round her in which were several handsome fellows who my jealous eye instantly discovered were all ambitious of her regard  The moment I had a glimpse of her I was seized with a trembling that shook my whole frame and a sickness that I with difficulty subdued I approached  stopped turned aside again advanced again hesitated and was once more almost overcome by a rising of the heart that was suffocating and a swimming of the brain that made my limbs stagger my eyes roll and deprived me of sight  It was sometime before I could make another attempt At length I caught her eye With the rapidity of lightening her cheek was suffused with blushes and as instantaneously changed to a deathlike pale It was my habitual error to interpret every thing in my own favour and the conviction that she was suffering emotions similar to my own was transport to me  For some minutes I mingled with the croud fearful of a relapse on my own part and on hers but keeping her in sight and presenting myself to her view till I was rouzed by an apparent motion of the aunt to rise I then advanced but still in an ague fit of apprehension I attempted to bow and in a faltering  and feeble voice pronounced her name 'hoped she was well and'I could proceed no farther  My disease was infectious She sat a moment severely struggling with her feelings and then returned a kind of inarticulate complimentary answer  'What is the matter Olivia' said the aunt 'How strangely you look child Who is the gentleman'  Olivia made another effort'It is Mr Trevor Madam the grandson of the rector of * * *'  'Oh ho The young Oxonian that my nephew Hector tells the comical story about of the methodist preacher and of his throwing you into the water and then taking you out again'  The tone form and features of the old lady with this short introductory dialogue gave me a strong but no encouraging picture of her character Her voice was masculine her nose short her mouth wide her brow bent and bushy  and the corners of her eyes and cheeks deeply wrinkled I attempted to enter into conversation but my efforts were aukward the answers of the aunt were broad coarse and discouraging and Olivia though embarrassed I accused of being cold The manner of the old lady clearly indicated that she suspected my design and an endeavour in me to prolong the conversation by turning it on my native county drew from her the following animadversions  'I have heard a great deal about your family Mr Trevor and of the ridiculous opposition which your grandfather pretended to make to my late brother Mowbray Your mother I think was twice married and as I have been told both times very imprudently so that the proud hopes which the rector entertained of raising a family were all overthrown But that is always the case with clandestine matches Many families of much greater consequence than  ever yours was Mr Trevor have been brought low by such foolish and wicked doings Young girls that have indulged improper connections and secret lovers have involved themselves and all their relations in ruin by their guilty proceedings You are but a petty instance of the base and bad consequences of the crimes of such foolish young hussies Come niece'  They both rose to go The dialogue that had just passed had no listeners though of that circumstance the aunt was evidently regardless The circle round Olivia had presently dispersed as good manners required when I a stranger came up The repugnant and ominous behaviour of the aunt did but increase the impetuous haste that I felt to know the worst and addressing myself to Olivia I asked with some eagerness 'If I might be permitted to pay her my respects while she continued at Bath'  The aunt fixed her eye on me 'Look  you' said she 'Mr Trevor you are a handsome young fellow and I do not want handsome young fellows about my niece I see too many of them they have little fortune and less shame they give me a deal of trouble no good can come of their smirking and smiling their foppery and their forward prate My niece I believe has much more prudence than is usual with the young minxes of the present day But no matter for that I am sure there is no prudence in setting gunpowder too near the fire I have heard her talk of your taking her out of the water in a manner that if I did not know her I should not quite like So I must plainly tell you Sir as I can see no good that can come of your acquaintance I shall take care to prevent all harm Not that there is much fear for she knows her duty and has always done it Neither can you have entertained any impertinent notions it would be too ridiculous Though what my nephew  and Mr Andrew told me I own did seem as if you could strangely forget yourself But at once to cut matters short I now tell you plainly and down right her choice is made Yes Sir her choice is positively made and so though I do not suppose you have taken any foolish crotchets and improper whims into your head for that would be too impertinent yet as you knew one another when children and so forth it was best to be plain with you at once because though such ridiculous nonsense was quite impossible I hear on all hands you are a bold and flighty young gentleman and that you have no little opinion of yourself'  Dumb founded as I was by this undisguised refusal this hard unfeeling reprimand I made no attempt to reply or follow The flushings of Olivia's face indeed were continual but what were they more than indignant repellings of her aunt's broad surmises Had they  been favourable to me why did she not declare them with the openness of which she had so striking an example She curtsied as she went but it was a halfsouled compliment that while I attempted to return my heart resented  They disappeared and I remained feeling as if now first made sensible of the extreme folly the lunacy of all my actions The dialogue I had just heard vibrated in my brain burning and wasting it with the frenzy of agonizing recollection "I was a forward prating fop of little fortune and less shame Bold and flighty with no little opinion of myself again and again I was ridiculous and impertinent My crotchets whims and nonsense were impossible"  Nor was this all There was another piece of intelligence an additional and dreadful feature of despair the name of Andrews Detested sound Racking idea "Her choice is made positively made" Excruciating thought Why  then welcome ruin sudden and irrevocable ruin  As soon as I could recover sufficient recollection I hurried home where I remained in a trance of torment and disposed to a thousand acts of madness that were conceived and dismissed with a rapidity of pain that rendered my mind impotent to all except the inflicting torture on itself  At last the agony in which I sat was interrupted by the appearance of Belmont We had agreed to go to Lansdown races he told me it was now time took me by the arm and hurried me away  Reckless of where I went or what I did I obeyed The course was at no great distance a carriage was not to be procured and we walked The steepness of the hill the heat of the day and above all the anguish of my heart threw me into a violent heat The drops rolled down my cheeks and I put my handkerchief  lightly into my hat to prevent its pressure Lost in a revery of misery I acted instinctively and breathed the dust heard the hubbub and saw the confusion around me without perceiving them  After the first heat there was a battle toward which I was dragged by Belmont In the tumult and distraction of my thoughts I scarcely knew what happened and feeling in my pocket for my handkerchief I missed it A croud and a pickpocket was an immediate suggestion Neither coolness nor recollection were present to me I saw a man putting up a red and white handkerchief Which I supposed to be mine and springing forward I caught him by the collar and exclaimed 'Rascal you have robbed me' In an instant the mob flocked round us and the supposed pickpocket was seized 'Duck him Duck him' was the general cry and away the poor fellow was immediately hurried Half  awakened by the unpremeditated danger into which I had brought him I began to repent Belmont who had lost sight of me came up and asked what was the matter  'A fellow has picked my pocket' said I  'Of what'  'Of my handkerchief'  'Your handkerchief Is it not under your hat'  I snatched it off examined and there the handkerchief wasI was struck speechless  The man whom I had falsely accused made a violent resistance the mob was dragging him along rending his clothes off his back and halftearing him in pieces The state of my mind was little short of frenzy In a tone of command I bade Belmont follow made my way into the thickest of the croud and furio sly began to beat the people who were ill using the prisoner calling till I  was hoarse 'Let him alone He is innocent I am to blame'  My efforts were vain A mob has many hands but no ears My blows were returned fifty fold I was inveloped by one mob myself while the poor wretch was hauled along by another Not all my struggles could save him I could not get free and the man as Belmont afterward informed me was half drowned after which he escaped and nobody knew what was become of him  These were but a part of the accidents of the day My mind was maddening and I was ripe for mischief Belmont in the evening went to the hazard table and I determined to accompany him to which he encouraged me The impetus was given and as if resolved on destruction I put all my money except a ten pound note to pay my Bath debts in my pocket Though ignorant of the cause of them Belmont discovered my inclinations  He took care to be at the place before the company assembled  An accomplice as I afterward learned was present who displayed guineas and bank notes sufficient to convince me that he was my man if I could but win them I was as eager as they could de  ire and to increase my ardour was occasionally suffered to win a rich stake My success was of short duration I soon began to  and foam with rage In the midst of this scene Hector Mowbray and tall Andrews came in who unknown to me were at Bath They saw me close my accounts and by their looks enjoyed my fury The whole company wh  c  now began to be numerous understood that I left off play because I had no more money to lose The pigeon was completely plucked  This was the climax of misery at which I seemed ambitious to arrive During six hours I sat in a state of absolute  stupor and echoed the uproar and blasphemy that surrounded me with deep but unconscious groans I do not know that I so much as moved till the company was entirely dispersed and I was awakened from my torpor by the groom porter I then languidly returned to my lodging exhausted and unable longer to support the conflicting torture  END OF VOL III
