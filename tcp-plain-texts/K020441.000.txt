 TOM JONES  Price One Shilling and Six Pence  TOM JONES A COMIC OPERA As it is Performed at the THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  By JOSEPH REED  THE SECOND EDITION  LONDON Printed for BECKET and DE HONDT in the Strand and RICHARDSON and URQUHART at the Royal Exchange  MDCCLXIX  PREFACE  IT is needless to say the following Opera is taken from FIELDING'S celebrated novel of  Tom Jones  a production so replete with wit hu∣mour and character that it can never want ad∣mirers while the English language remains My extreme veneration for the memory of the trulywitty and ingenious novelist naturally led me to  preserve  as much of FIELDING throughout my Opera as the nature of my plan would allow Nay when it was thought necessary to shorten the piece lest it should be too long in representation I readily  parted with my own  to  retain  as much as possible of the  invaluable Original  I have made many material deviations from the novel both in point of fable and character I have stripp'd its hero of his libertinism to render him as I imagined more amiable and interesting and have metamorphos'd Parson  Supple  into a country 'squire to avoid giving offence to the  cloth  The characters of  Western  and  Honour  I have divested of their provinciality lest the at∣tention of the performers to the pronunciation of an uncouth and difficult dialect should produce an  Inattention  to the more material business of the drama I have also endeavoured to purge Wes∣tern's character of its coarseness and indelicacy in conformity to the refined taste of the present age and of its Jacobitism from an opinion that such political sect no longer exists as well as from  a conviction that nothing of party should ever ap∣pear within the walls of a theatre  While I was writing the last act of this Opera which was in June the  French  Tom Jones fell into my hands I found its plan so very confined and so materially different from mine that I could reap little or no benefit from it The only particulars of which I have availed my∣self from Mons POINSINET are the hint of  legi∣timating  Jones and the thought which gave rise to my  second  air I have quoted the lines from which I received advantage in the latter instance  Que les devoirs que tu m'imposes  Triste raison ont de rigueur  Tu gémis Sophie tu n'oses  T'interroger sur ta douleur  Quand sous tes doigts naissent les roses  Les epines sont dans ton coeur  ADVERTISEMENT  N B This Opera is entered in the Hallbook of the Company of Stationers and whoever pirates any part of it will be prosecuted  Dramatis Personae  ALLWORTHY Mr

round during the Song  AIR  Set by Mr  ARNOLD  Jon  NO sport to the chace can compare  So manly the pleasures it yields  How sweet how refreshing that air  Inhal'd in the woods and the fields  As we rush in pursuit new scenes still appear  New landscapes encounter the eye  Not Handel's sweet music more pleases the ear  Than that of the hounds in full cry  New strength from the chace we derive  Its exercise purges the blood  How happy that mortal must live  Whose sport yields both physic and food  So new and so varied its charms they ne'er cloy  Like those of the bottle and face  The oftner the harder the more we enjoy  The more we're in love with the chace  Wes  Gentlemen tho' none of you will stay dinner I must insist on your pushing it about We've had a hard ride and a refreshing

singing  SCENE  a genteel Apartment  SOPHIA  working a Chairbottom and  HONOUR  sewing  AIR  Mr  HOLCOMBE  So  When tyrant love that foe to rest  Despotic rules a virgin's breast  The needle she employs in vain  To banish thought to banish pain  For while beneath her fingers grows  In mimic bloom the silken rose  The fair by real anguish torn  Feels in her heart the growing thorn  Hon  I'm sorry ma'am to see you look so grave this afternoon I'm afraid Mr Jones runs in your head  So  Mr Jones runs in my head What is Mr Jones to me  Hon  Nothing ma'am He's not a proper match for you to be sure with your fortune you may command one of the greatest lords of the land therefore you won't cer∣tainly stoop to marry a beggar and a foundling  So  I don't know what you mean by taking these li∣berties with Mr Jones The misfortune of his birth is not his crime  Hon  Ma'am if it was a disgrace Mr Jones has a great many people that carry their heads very high to keep him in countenancewell he's one of the sweetest gentlemen that ever trod on shoeleather Every body likes him all the neighbourhood for five miles round would run through fire and water for himif I were in your cloaths and he loved me as much as I believe he loves you  So  Loves me Honour I don't understand you  Hon  Ma'am I may be mistaken it's true because as the man says we can be sure of nothing in this world but death and taxes however I could tell you something that looks very like it  So  Ay pray what's that Honour  Hon  He came into the room as I was sitting at work and what should be upon the table but the muff you gave me and my gentleman whips his hands into it "La Mr Jones you'll spoil it" says I but he still kept his hands in it and kiss'd it and mumbled it and kiss'd itfor my part I never saw such kisses in my life as he gave it  So  When was this  Hon  Let me seeit was the day after I dreamt that I was married to Sir Timothy Tipplelast Thursdayay it was on ThursdayBut that is not all neitheryesterday as you were playing on the harpsichord he was in the next room and look'd melanchollysays I "What's the matter Mr  Jones A penny for your thoughts""Hussy" says he starting up as from a dream "what can I be thinking of when that angel your mistress is playing"But I'm afraid you're offended ma'am  So  No noproceed  Hon  Then squeezing my handhe squeez'd so hard that I thought he would have forc'd the blood out of my fingerends"Oh Mrs Honour says he how happy will that man be"and then he sigh'dUpon my faith his breath is as sweet as a nosegaybut for heaven's sake ma'am don't speak of this for he gave me a guinea never to mention it However as I did not swear it it's only a promise and what signifies a promise  AIR  Set by Mr  ARNOLD  At court where true breeding abounds  They never let promises bind 'em  In country in cities in towns  'Tis likewise the mode not to mind 'em  To promises never give trust  Of truth they are seldom the token  The old proverb says a pyecrust  And a promise were made to be broken  So  Honour if you will never mention this affair again I'll not be angry with you It may come to my father's ears and he would be displeas'd at Mr Jones tho' I really believe he meant no harm  Hon  Harm ma'am I'm positive sure he meant no harm"Yes Honour says he I'm neither such a coxcomb nor such a villian as to look upon her in any other light but as my goddess and as such I will always worship and adore her while I have breath"this was all ma'am so you plainly see he meant no harm  So  Well well let me hear no more of thisI'll take a walk in the garden  takes up a muff  Lord what an odious muff is this I can't bear itpray fetch me my old one Honour  Hon  What that your ladyship gave me  So  Ay that fetch it this minute  Hon  I will ma'amthe old muff again Oh ho  aside exit  So  Love will not be conceal'd We try to deceive our∣selves we try to deceive others but alas 'tis all in vain The more we attempt to conceal our affections the more we expose ourselves and our very servants are witnesses of our weakness  AIR  Set by Mr  ARNOLD  That passion which harrows the soul  By reason we strive to remove  But reason's too weak to controul  A passion so pow'rful as love  Then why this vain war with desire  Resistance but doubles the smart  The more I oppose the fierce fire  It rages the more in my heart  Enter  HONOUR  with a Muff  Hon  Here it is ma'am  gives it to Sophia  So  Thank you dear HonourI'll wear it again In∣stead of it you may take the lutestring night town  Hon  Ma'am I'm very much obliged to you  Exit Soph sighing and kissing the muff  A lutestring night∣gown for an old muffto be sure she does not love Mr Jones No not she dear creatureWell if I had twice her fortune I shouldn't think myself a crumb too good for himhere he comes Heavens bless him He's a sweet man that's the truth on't  Enter  JONES  Jon  Mrs Honour your servant How does your young lady today  Hon  Very well Mr Joneswe've just been talking of you  Jon  Of me Mrs Honour  Hon  Yes SirI've been telling her thatthat  Jon  What  Hon  Why what you said when she was playing on the harpsichord  Jon  Bless me Mrs Honour How could you when I so earnestly desir'd your secrecy  Hon  Sir I had really no design to mention it but Old Scratch push'd me on a purpose to make me break my word  Jon  Walking about  I shall never be able to look her in the face again  Hon  Nay for that matter you need not be in such a fluster neither I don't believe she's angry at you be∣cause she begg'd the muff again tho' I told her of your kissing it  Jon  Again Why had she given it you  Hon  Yes sir and she has just now bid me take a silk gown for it Now you know if she was angry she would scarce take to wearing it again  Jon  Why that's trueyet she must be displeas'd at my presumption in entertaining even the most distant thoughts of herI pray thee dear Honour unsay it all to Sophia Tell her it was only an invention of thy own  Takes hold of her hand  Enter  WESTERN  and  SUPPLE  West  Ah you liquorish rogue what are you about Honour go and tell Sophy to come hither  Hon  Yes sir  Exit  AIR  Mr  GRANOM  Wes  Come leave off these tricks or  I'll lend you a flick sir  I guess you young dog what you drive at  For shame Keep aloof sir  While under my roof sir  Pray none of your wenches in private  You'll give the world handle  My mansion to scandal  Remember few damsels are barren  Then beat up elsewhere sir  The game and forbear sir  To poach any more in my warren  Enter  SOPHIA  Wes  Kiss me Sophy I have not had a buss of thee these two daysI want a little of the motion of thy  fingers  Shakes his fingers  "Old sir Simon the king"  sings  So  Sitting down to the harpsichord  Papa you have it so often that I wonder you don't tire of it I have this morning been practising an air which I yesterday over∣heard Mr Jones sing to sir Timothy when you retir'd to take your afternoon's naplet me give it you Mr Jones will perhaps favour you with the words  Wes  Come Tom let's have it  Jon  With all my heart sir  AIR  Dr  ARNE  Swains tell me no more of the transports divine  You reap with the women exclusive of wine  Wine heightens our pleasures each joy will improve  Adds smartness to converse and fuel to love  Nor tell me ye topers that wine ever made  You perfectly happy without woman's aid  This maxim attend if true bliss you would have  Of both be a lover to neither a slave  Wes  Thank you Tom  As Sophia plays the symphony the muff drops on the harpsichord  I wonder what busi∣ness your damn'd muff has there to spoil your playing  throws it away  I wish one of my beagles would come and tear it in pieces  So  Runs and snatches the muff  I would not have it torn in pieces for a thousand pounds  Jon  O the enchanting angel  Wes  A thousand pounds It was hardly ever worth a thousand farthingsbut I know you say this by way of contradiction you're like your mother for that  So  Would I could be like her in every thing for she was one of the worthiest women upon earth  Wes  Why there wasn't a worse wife in all christendom than she made She would sit you sulk sulk sulking from day's end to day's end and all only because her fa∣ther forc'd her to marry me She had no more affection for me to the hour of her death than if I had been an Egyptian mummy or a Russian bear  Sophia bursts into tears and exit  Ay this is always madam's way when  I talk about her motherbut we must crack a bottle toge∣ther I didn't drink much above a pint at dinner and I generally make it up a bottle by way of concoction as they call it  Sup  You know 'squire I seldom object to a proposal of this kind  Wes  No nor to any other proposal I'll say that for theeBut what say you Tom  Jon  No more wine for me I thank you sir I must go and change my dress  Wes  Dress What signifies dress you monkey when you're among friends  Sup  I'll be hang'd Jones if you have not some wench or other in your eye or you'ld hardly take so much pains in adorning your person  Wes  So I think cuz for what signifies dress if one does not want to make the women fond of one  Jon  Very true sir and where is the man that does not wish to make the women fond of himand so your servant gentlemen  Exit  Wes  I must keep a sharp lookout or this young rogue will be getting hold of some of the hussies in my family as sure as a gun  AIR  O my kitten  And should a young bantling appear  Dame scandal at me will let fly  Each neighbour will snigger and fleer  "I guess who'as a hand in the pye"  The jokers a fine game will go  And hourly have me on the hip  With "'squire an old coachman you know  Loves always the smack of the whip"  Cracks his whip  Enter Mrs  WESTERN  and her  MAID  Mrs Wes  I think this post will never comeBetty take that pamphlet and lay it on my toilette I must finish it before I sleep  Exit Maid  This author eluci∣dates the affair of continental connexions in a most master∣ly manner and his reasoning upon the national debt and  internal and external taxation is unanswerablebrother your servant I want to have a little talk with younay you need not go Mr Supple it is nothing but what may be mention'd in your presence  Wes  Well what is't about sister  Mrs Wes  Pray have not you observ'd something very extraordinary in your daughter of late  Wes  Not I  Mrs Wes  Nor you Mr Supple  Sup  Not I madam  Mrs Wes  Gentlemen I am absolutely astonish'd at your blindness  Wes  Why is there any thing the matter with the girl  Mrs Wes  Yes I think there is and of much conse∣quence too  Wes  If any thing be the matter acquaint me with it at once for you know I love her more than my own soul  Mrs Wes  Nay nay the disorder is not so very danger∣ousI believe gentlemen you are both pretty well con∣vincedyou more especially Mr Supplethat I know the world  Sup  Not one person on the whole globe knows it so well as yourself  Wes  That's a damn'dI know what  aside  Mrs Wes  Nay now cousin that is going rather too far The globe you know is of very extraordinary circum∣ference and there are undoubtedly persons on it some few persons who perhaps may exceedat least equal me in that particularwell I promise you I was never more deceiv'd in my life if my niece be not  Wes  What what  Mrs Wes  Most desperately in love  Wes  How in love Fall in love without asking me leave I'll disinherit her I'll turn her out of doors  Mrs Wes  This is so like you Always in a passion be∣fore you know why  Wes  Zounds Don't I know  Mrs Wes  You know nothing nothing in the world there is scarce a less intellectual being in the creationsuppose now she should have fixed upon the very person whom you yourself would wish I hope you would not be angry then  Wes  No no no that makes a wide difference if she only marries the man I would have her she may love any body she pleases  Mrs Wes  Brother I must compliment you on the in∣crease of your understanding for this is positively the most sensible expression that ever escaped youI will dis∣claim all knowledge of the world if the person my niece hath chosen be not the very person you would chuse for her  Wes  But who is he  Mrs Wes  Nay e'en find that out your self You who are so profound a politicianin your own opinioncan be at no great loss That judgment which can penetrate into the cabinets of princes and discern the secret springs which move the statewheels in all the political machines in Europe can surely very easily find out what passes in the rude uninform'd mind of a girl  Wes  Sister don't talk your courtgibberish to me I don't understand the lingo and moreover and besides you know I hate every thing that belongs to the court It's well for thee that thou'rt a woman or I'd have lent thee many a flick for talking to me so much courtnonsense I'd have thrash'd thy jacket for thee I promise thee  Mrs Wes  Ay ay in that flicking and thrashing lies all your fancied superiority Your bodies not your brains are stronger than ours 'Tis with you as with the brute creation in general the greater your bulk and strength the smaller your intellects  Wes  But prithee tell me what you mean about my daughter  Mrs Wes  Hold a moment while I digest that sove∣reign contempt I have for your sextherenow good politic sir with all your prodigious share of suppos'd saga∣city what think you ofMr Blisil  Wes  Blifil  speaking together  Sup  Blifil  speaking together  Mrs Wes  Ay Blifildon't you remember gentlemen she fainted away in the field about a month ago on seeing him lie breathless on the ground in consequence of some hostilities offer'd him by Jones on account of a sarcastic sneer on his illegitimate birth When we came up to the scene of action did not you observe her look pale  Sup  Yes as pale as a playhouseghost I perfectly re∣member  Wes  'Fore George now you mind me on't I remember it all I knew Sophy was a good girl and wouldn't fall in love to make me angryI was never more rejoic'd in my life for nothing can lie so handy as the two estates they are as one may say join'd in matrimony already and it would be a thousand pities to part them  Sup  So it would cousin  Wes  And yet I can't tell what to think on't for All∣worthy is such a queer chap that money has no effect on him  Sup  No effect on him Then he must be made of dif∣ferent materials from the rest of mankind  AIR  Peggy's Mill  That gold is an idol all people adore  Their practice evinces most clearly  E'en patriots themselves often grasp at this ore  Their country scarce loving so dearly  Let the prelate 'gainst riches employ tongue and pen  Be his eloquence ever so charming  Only think of his lordship's full coffers and then  You'll sneer at both preacher and sermon  Wes  But what would you have me do sister  Mrs Wes  Since you condescend to ask my advice you may propose the match to Allworthy yourself There is no indecorum in the proposal's coming from a parent King Alcinous offers in Pope's Odyssey his daughter to Ulysses  Wes  King Alcinous offers Pope Odyssey his daughter Ulysses  Mrs Wes  Brother your ignorance provokes me to smile  Wes  Allworthy is gone to visit a sick tenant and will call in his returnsuppose I mention the matter  Mrs Wes  Do so do so and desire him to bring Blifil to dine with us tomorrow  Wes  Odd rabbit it If Allworthy should refuse the match I shall be for lending him a flick as sure as the  devil's in London for I can't bear to have my girl slighted  Sup  Don't be afraid of that the match is too advantage∣ous to be refus'd  Mrs Wes  Brother do you suppose Mr Allworthy has more contempt for money because he professes more You would make a fine plenipo at a general congress You would negotiate with these Machiavels the French with great dexterity  Wes  I'm sure I could make as good a negotiator as you or any political old woman in the nation tho' we've a great many of them  Mrs Wes  You negotiate Yes for a few acres of land or a stack of hay  Sup  Here's a quarrel abrewing I had best march  Exit  Wes  Before you women set up for managing state af∣fairs you should learn the needful art of keeping a secret  Mrs Wes  I insist on't that we keep secrets better than you hecreatures  Wes  In your intrigues I grant you there you've the advantage of usNo no sister tho' the folks at the head of affairs are no great conjurers yet they are rather wiser than to trust an old woman with their secrets ha ha ha  Mrs Wes  Sir you're both a brute and a blockhead and if you had the least spice of intellects or goodman∣ners you would scorn to use a gentlewoman of my ac∣knowledg'd abilities in this preposterous mannerNot∣withstanding your horselaugh it is my happiness to be universally regarded as a phenomenon in the political hemisphere and as a nonpareil in the knowledge of the worldWiser than trust a woman with their secretsSir I beg leave to tell you there are persons of the first distinctionyes of the very first distinction in the poli∣tical world who have not thought it beneath their dignity to trust me ay me sir with the most important secretsAnd let me tell you further sir I have had the honour of being closetted with a primeminister and consulted on an expedition before it has been communicated to either king or council  Wes  Closetted with a primeminister I'm afraid sister there has been something more than politics in the case  Mrs Wes  How dare you have the effrontery to make so scurrilous and indelicate an innuendo to a woman of my irreproachable character A woman who instead of studying personal embellishments hath taken so much pains in adorning her head  Wes  Yes yes you do take pains enough to adorn your head you build it up to a monstrous height indeed Ecod I can't help laughing whenever I look at it  AIR  The women attempted some few years ago  Their lovers to charm with a small head  But now in their noddles as bumpy they show  As if the whole carcase was all head  This fashion the sex of admirers will rob  Their conquests they certainly push ill  In striving to charm with a bolster'dout nob  As large as a Winchesterbushel  Exit  Mrs Wes  Was there ever so affronting a savageWiser than trust a woman with their secretsHe has no more breedingWere it not for his daughter I would depart like an offended ambassador without taking leave  Enter  SOPHIA  reading  Come hither Sophywhat book is that Let me see it childHeloisa to AbelardI thought it was something on loveyou blush childah Sophy Sophy I know what passes in that little heart of yours more than you ima∣ginedo you think I don't know the reason of your over∣acting all that friendship for Mr Blifil the other day  So  Heavens Am I discovered  aside  Mrs Wes  Nay you need not blush it is a passion which both I and your father approvecome constitute and appoint me of your privycouncil and I will guaranty to you the peaceable possession of your Adonisdon't sigh my dear but out with it allno reserve I conjure youthe  affair is already on the carpet and your father is going to have a private audience with Mr Allworthy in order to propose the match and will invite the heirpresumptive of your affections to dine with us tomorrow  So  Tomorrow my dear aunt  fetching her breath  You frighten me out of my senses  Mrs Wes  Oh my dear you'll soon come to yourself for he's a most charming young fellow  So  I must own I don't know another man that seems to have so many good qualities  Mrs Wes  Yes yes he has a great many indeed I don't wonder at your loving him  So  So brave  Mrs Wes  And yet so gentle  So  So witty  Mrs Wes  Yet so inoffensive  So  So humane so sprightly  speaking both together  Mrs Wes  So civil so  speaking both together  My dear there is no getting in a word with you  So  What signifies the circumstance of his birth when compared with such qualifications  Mrs Wes  His birth Pray what circumstance is there in the least derogatory to the birth of Mr Blifil  So  Mr Blifil  Mrs Wes  Mr Blifil Ay of whom else have we had this conference  So  Good heaven Of Mr Jones I thought  Mrs Wes  Jones And is it possible you can think of allying yourself to illegitimacy The blood of the Westerns could never submit to such contaminationyou are the first yes Miss Western you are the very first of your name since the landing of Julius Caesar that ever enter∣tain'd so groveling a thought The female Westerns have been proverbially call'd the Dianas of the age since the Conquestand you to defile a stream of blood which hath flow'd with such purity for so many hundredcen∣turies  So  My dear aunt don't put yourself in so violent a rage  Mrs Wes  Fall in love with one of spurious origin I thought miss the pride of your family would have re∣strain'd  such monstrous inclinationsLove indeed is well enough in tradespeople's daughters chambermaids and such lowbred reptiles but in a woman of family it is the most ridiculous thing upon earth To the praise of the present nobility be it spoken there is hardly any such thing as love to be met with in our right honourable matches  So  But madam  Mrs Wes  And you to think of disgracing yourself and family by so vulgar so preposterous a passionI'll to your father this instant and inform him of the grossness the depravity of your affection  So  kneeling  Alas my dear madam  Mrs Wes  It is in vain to importune me the match is resolv'd upon and nothing can nor shall prevent it  AIR  Van  MALDERE  So  Dearest aunt attend my prayer  Let your indignation cease  These stern looks my bosom tear  Have some pity on a niece  From this hard this cruel stroke  Your lov'd darling kindly save  The sad sentence O revoke  Or you doom me to the grave  Mrs Wes  'Tis all to no purposeyour solicitation is totally inadmissible  So  rising  But madam you will surely give me time to get the better of my disinclination to Mr Blifil  Mrs Wes  It would be fine politics indeed to protract a siege when the enemy's army is at hand and in danger of relieving the town As your heart is in so critical a situation I will do all I can to hasten the match and put your honour out of the care of your familyI shan't ac∣quaint your father with your hopeful passion but if you ever speak to this spurious swain any more he shall know the whole I would therefore advise you to evacuate your heart of its attachment to so inadequate a pretender as Jones and turn your thoughts wholly on the intended al∣liance between you and Mr Allworthy's heirapparent  Exit  Enter  HONOUR  Hon  Bless me ma'am what makes you look so sad  So  Alas Honour my father and aunt have resolv'd on a match between me and Mr Blifil  Hon  Lord forbid Even poor as I am I would scarce have him myself for I can't abide himhowever one comfort is that they can't force you whether you will or no to marry himDear ma'am do not sigh so  So  Yes I must be sacrific'd to familyviewstorment∣ing thought  AIR  Mr  BACH  Thirst of wealth too oft bewitches  The deluded parent's heart  But can worldly pomp or riches  Real happiness impart  Love's the sweetest dearest pleasure  To the human heart convey'd  Those who give up love for treasure  Quit the substance for the shade  Exit  Hon  I would not tell her that Mr Jones was in the garden for fear of offending herpoor soul he's walk∣ing by the canal step by step with his arms across and so thoughtful  walks as describ'd  I'm in a peck of fears and troubles lest he should be throwing himself inand yet I think I need not be afraid on't for hanging and drown∣ing for love is almost out of fashionThis match with Blifil will be a terrible affair to my poor mistress for if love has not already got hold of her little heart I am hugely mistakenfor my part I can't blame her for liking so charming a man as Mr Jones  AIR  Had I quite clear in land a year  Full twenty thousand pound  And did surpass the fairest lass  That ever trod the ground  Tho' dukes and lords with stars and swords  Should court while courting's good  For him alone I'd slight each don  I wish I may die but I would  He is in truth a wellmade youth  And of the sweetest mein  Whoe'er his wife she'll lead a life  As happy as a queen  No courtly dame need think it shame  To wed if he should woo  No swain I know could charm me so  I wish I may die if I do  Runs off singing  SCENE  A Garden  JONES  Jon  There can be no hopes of her father's consent and Mr Allworthy would never pardon an attempt to marry her without itnay I could scarce pardon myself Conscience teaches me that to repay the friendships of hospitality by this worst kind of robbery is to be the meanest the basest of all robbersYet is there not a great difference between clandestinely marrying a friend's daughter from a motive of love and doing it from a sordid motive of interestCer∣tainlybut then her father would disclaim her and shall I whose sole support flows from Mr Allworthy's unmerited bounty involve her in my distress Her who has been brought up with such tenderness elegance and delicacyThat that hath determined meNo no no let me not make her unhappy however miserable I may be myselfI must think no more of her  AIR  Dr  ARNE  What pity that nature has cast  Between us this distance in life  When nearness in temper and taste  Hath form'd us for husband and wife  Sould Hymen my passion befriend  How sweet were each conjugal kiss  Such raptures our loves would attend  That angels might envy my bliss  Enter  SOPHIA  Miss Western your most obedientthis is an unexpected pleasure indeed  So  The fineness of the weather has tempted me outhere's a heavenly afternoon and the reflexion of the sun upon the water makes the canal appear remarkably beauti∣fulI fancy Mr Jones you have some little shuddering when you see that water  Jon  Shuddering my dear madam why  So  You cannot have forgot tho' 'tis so long ago your plunge into the canal when the bough broke as you were climbing the tree to recover your little namesake  Jon  I assure you madam the concern which you felt for the loss of your bird will always appear to me the highest circumstance of that boyish adventure  So  Upon my word Mr Jones your gallantry had very nearly cost you your life  Jon  Madam if I have any reason to reflect with sorrow it is that the water was not a little deeper  So  Sure you cannot be in earnest This affected con∣tempt of life is only an excess of your complaisance You would endeavour to lessen the obligation of having ventur'd it twice on my accountyou know it was last year in danger when you broke your arm by leaping off your horse to prevent mine from throwing meyou have escap'd twice but beware the third time  Looks at him very languishingly  Jon  Oh Miss Western can you desire me to live Can you wish me so ill  So  Indeed Mr Jones III don't wish you ill I don't indeed  Jon  Madam you wish me ill if you wish me to live for life begins to be insupportableyour caution comes too late the mischief is already done  So  Nay now I don't understand you  Jon  My dear Miss Western I would not be under∣stoodI know not what I saymeeting you here so un∣expectedly I have been unguarded I have utter'd that which I had resolv'd everlastingly to bury in this bosompardon me most angelic creature if I have said any thing to offend you  So  Mr Jones I will not affect to misunderstand you but if you have any regard for me let me make the best of my way into the houseI
