 TWO SERMONS  THE FIRST ON  Comparing spiritual Things with spiritual  PREACHED AT THE PRIMARY VISITATION of the LORD BISHOP of WINCHESTER At SOUTHAMPTON JULY AND PRINTED At the Request of the BISHOP and CLERGY THE SECOND  On the Simplicity of the Gospel  PREACHED LIKEWISE At SOUTHAMPTON AT THE VISITATION of the CHANCELLOR of the Diocese September AND NOW PRINTED AT HIS REQUEST  By WILLIAM GILPIN M A PREBENDARY OF SALISBURY AND VICAR OF BOLDRE IN NEWFOREST NEAR LYMINGTON  LONDON PRINTED FOR R BLAMIRE STRAND  TO THE HONORABLE AND RIGHT REVEREND THE LORD BISHOP OF WINCHESTER THIS SERMON IS INSCRIBED BY HIS LORDSHIP'S MOST OBEDIENT AND MOST RESPECTFUL HUMBLE SERVANT  WILLIAM GILPIN  SERMON I  ON Comparing spiritual things with spiritual  COR ii  Which things we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual  WHEN St Paul planted the gospel at Corinth he found his designs chiefly opposed by two kinds of people  The first were men of pleasure Corinth lay commodiously for trade and trade pro∣duces riches and it had been early observed that it was difficult for  rich men to enter into the kingdom of heaven  They were more disposed to the pleasures which riches furnish than to the comforts which religion administers and even they who had embraced christianity found much work for the apostle in keeping them pure from the contagion that was spread abroad  Besides the gay and thoughtless the apostle had another kind of people to contend with These were philosophers and tho they were a more respectable set of men than the other they were at the same time perhaps more intractable A state of learning is in itself no doubt favourable to religion at least in a certain degree and has ever been found so but the philosopher himself has sometimes too much wisdom to be taught The Corinthian philosophers certainly had and were in general rather inclined to add something of their own to amend the gospel than to accept it in that simplicity in which Paul preached it  To the latter the text alludes These philosophizing christians many of whom were probably teachers also the apostle endeavours to recall to the simplicity of the gospel He sets before them his own example He came not he tells them  with the excellency of speech or the inticing words of man's wisdom  He knew nothing among them but  Jesus Christ and him crucified  adding that he had never preached  the words which man's wisdom teach∣eth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth com∣paring spiritual things with spiritual  In this passage the apostle gives us the only true rule of interpreting scripture which rule I shall endeavour to illustrate by shewing  How the apostles were directed by it  and  How it seems applicable to us  The text has I know been applied by some interpreters to  persons  rather than  things  but I think the whole context favours the sense in which I take it  In the first place the apostle tells us he avoided  the words which man's wisdom teach∣eth  In the apostle's days indeed man's wis∣dom had made only a little progress in the affairs of religion We read of Hymeneus Philetus and a few others who seemed desi∣rous of being  teachers before they understood what they affirmed  But their number was small  Man's wisdom however was a kind of leaven which made a rapid progress We need only cursorily examine ecclesiastical history to see it's mischievous effects There we find men running such lengths of folly extravagance wildness and I may add of wickedness that we may well suppose it was in the spirit of  foresight  that the apostle puts us somuch on  our guard against man's wisdom Man's wis∣dom hath filled innumerable volumes the purity of the gospel is comprized in one  In this ingrateful field we might wander long The history of man's wisdom is the his∣tory of his opinions and of these there is no end Zeal and indiscretion pride and vani∣ty bad meanings and good meanings have all contributed to interpret what the Holy Ghost teacheth by the words of man's wisdom In∣stead therefore of wandering in this wide wil∣derness let us fix our eyes on those great land∣marks which the apostle has set up to lead us safely through it  The apostles were immediately inspired They taught as the Holy Ghost instructed Immediate inspiration  brought all things to their remembrance whatever their blessed Lord had taught them  At the same time it should seem that the inspiration of the apostles was restricted to what was  new  in the religion they taughtor if not wholly new yet so obscurely shadowed out in prophecies and prophetic types that it needed certainly a full explanation The great truths with regard to the redemption of the worldthe intercession of Christthe con∣ditions  of acceptancethe universality of the christian religionthe motives it holds out the purity it hath introduced into moralsthe certainty of a future stateand of a last judg∣mentwere all no doubt strongly impressed on the minds of the apostles and properly opened by  immediate inspiration  In any of these great truths mistakes were dangerousmemory was frailand there were yet no written re∣cordsAt the same time such notices as were already on the records of inspiration those divine truths contained in the books of the Old Testamentwanted no farther illustra∣tion from the Holy Ghost Here nothing more seems to have been necessary than the use of reason and common sense And thus the apostle distinguishes between the things which God had  revealed by the spirit  and the act of  comparing spiritual things with spiritual  The one he calls  declaring the testimony of God  the other was plainly the exertion only of reason Nothing more than the exertion of reason was necessary to prove the connection between the Old Testament and the Newor to point out the completion of propheciesor to shew how the types of the law were fulfilled Of this mode of  reasoning  we find abundant instan∣ces  among the sacred writersin the epistle to the Hebrews especially  Thus then inspiration seems to have been necessary to direct the apostles in what was  hitherto unknown  but human reason seemed sufficient to enable them to  apply  what had been  already  inspired  Let us then now see how this rule which guided the apostles appears applicable to us or in what way we are to  speak what the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual  In the first place I think it plainly appears that we have no reason to expect immediate direction from  what the Holy Ghost teacheth  To wait for desultory illapses of the spirit to lead us into truth seems to have little countenance from scripture unless indeed we apply to ourselves such passages as by the fairest rules of interpre∣tation can apply only to the apostles And surely the greatest caution is necessary in settling a point which if it be an error tends to confirm all other errors When a man reasons himself into a mistake he may reason himself out of it again But when a man discards reason and substitutes in it's room a divine instructor every enthusiastic notion becomes then immedi∣ately  stamped with the character of divine truth The strange effects of such wildness we have often seen and are sufficiently guarded against it by the apostle's rule  As far indeed as a  holy life  is concerned we are assured every where in scripture that unless the endeavours of man are assisted by the Holy Spirit of God which dwells within him and to whose divine admonitions he ought ever to listen  he can do nothing  Here the divine aid is necessary Man as a  moral agent  with all the mischiefs of the fall about him want∣ed support  But the  investigation of truth  is a different affair It was not so much his  understanding  that was disturbed as his  will and affections  that were perverted  Wretched man  that he was he knew what was right but he could not practise it To  rectify his knowledge  enough had been done inspired truth was on record and he had a rule given him to understand it Farther aid would have rendered that rule un∣necessary and the expectation of any such aid enthusiastic  It is true indeed the pious Christian will read his bible with the best effect and in this sense no doubt the Holy Spirit may be  said to assist him in understanding the truth of scripture for  he who does the will of God will know of the doctrine whether it be of God  But this is still only the application of scripture to the rectifying of his  affections  To under∣stand it as a  system of truth  the rule given us  to compare spiritual things with spiritual  seems abundantly sufficient The New Testament is to us precisely in the state in which the Old Testament was to the apostles It is inspi∣ration recorded If farther inspiration be ne∣cessary a written record is more than is neces∣sary If God gave the greater why should he give the lessIt seems therefore fully suffi∣cient for the understanding of scripture to take it into our hands and in the spirit of sinceri∣ty and piety to compare one part with  another  or with a  general view  of the whole This seems in the apostle's idea the only key to the scriptures  But now it must be confessed that a va∣riety of causes have introduced difficulties into these sacred records Ancient customs not well understoodancient modes of speaking not conformable to our ownancient errors generated in times of ignorancemodern pre∣judices and opinions grafted on texts of  scripture misappliedhave united with other causes in disfiguring the plain and simple truths of the gospel  Why God suffered this  blot  as some may call it in the sacred record of his truth we know not Yet humbly tracing the reason of it in the analogy of his other works we may refer it to the general law of a state of trial Every thing here bears the marks of the fall In our moral pursuits we are ex∣ercised with various difficulties why not in the pursuit of religious truth In both we may be assisted if we apply the proper means In one the spirit of God will direct our en∣deavours in the other the great scriptural rule of  comparing spiritual things with spiri∣tual  The  honest application  of this rule without doubt would remove all the material difficul∣ties of scripture But instead of solving them in this way we too often endeavour to adjust them by the  words of man's wisdom  Hence arise all the disputes that have divided the church  The opinions which have occasioned them however varied run commonly in two great channelsthat of enthusiasm and that of  libertinism The enthusiast reads his bible too literally the libertine I use the word in it's less offensive sense too laxly The one utterly discards reason the other thinks no∣nothing but reason worth attending to The enthusiast loves a mystery because he does not understand it the libertine allows nothing to be a mystery what he does not under∣stand he rejectsLet us in an instance or two apply our great scriptural rule to them both  With regard to the jarring doctrine of faith and works it can never surely be settled by the literal application of a few scattered pas∣sages of St Paul but one should imagine it might easily be settled by comparing such passages with  other parts  of scripture and still more by an appeal to the  whole scheme of chris∣tianity  The very first book of the bible shews us that the gospel was meant to restore us to that purity of life which we had origi∣nally lost This indeed seems to be the leading point of christianity the word of God every where exhorting us to cleanse our heartsto purify our affectionsand to transform our∣selves into new creatures  Now it is certain all this must be done by faith  Whoever cometh to God through Christ must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him  So that in this sense we may be said to be  justified by faith  because without saith and it's accom∣panying virtues no man can attain that righteousness which the gospel requires as a proper qualification for our receiving the merits of Christ's death All christians therefore lay a stress on faith The great difference is the  partial  view makes it in itself an  end  the  com∣parative  view makes it the  means  only of a purified heart and a good life  With regard again to an awful doctrine which we have lately heard disputed with so much freedom one should think that a  com∣parison of spiritual things with spiritual  might lead us here also to one point The whole bible Old Testament and New prophecies and completion seem so full both of the hu∣manity and divinity of Christ that one should wonder how any one who believes the scrip∣tures could separate the two ideas If  only  human how inconsistent Here is a human being who engages in the arduous task of redeeming his fellowcreatures from sin We  must either therefore give up all idea of redemp∣tion of which the scripture is every where so fullor we must acknowledge the total  disproportion  of the work  The idea of redemption indeed is sometimes given up but still what difficulties remain unless we give up the scriptures also This human being shewed every sign of a divine nature He knew the thoughts of man which is always considered as one of the prerogatives of the Almighty He could forgive sin tho we all know that  none can forgive sin but God alone  This human being also had the powernot only of working miracles himself which many have possessedbut of commission∣ing others also to work them which no one ever attempted before This human being tho cautious in the early part of his ministry yet as he approached the end of it spoke so freely that those around him declared  he made himself equal with God  which was in fact the case This human being also was endowed with the strange and wonderful power of raising not only othersbut himself also from the dead and not only professed in his lifetime that he  would  sendbut after his ascension to heaven he actually  did  send the Holy Ghost upon his faithful followers com∣municating  to them powers unheard of before for the propagation of his religion In a word when we take a comprehensive view of the scrip∣tures and draw together the innumerable passa∣ges in which this great truth seems so plainly to be contained it is a difficult matter to con∣ceive how a denial of it is consistent with a belief in what we read Nor is this a matter to be reasoned upon like a point of mathematics or natural philosophy nor indeed does there seem a necessity to adduce the opinions of this or that father of the church The honest application of the rule before us is all that seems really necessary  That we do not understand this great mys∣tery is certain how indeed should we but we understand as much of it as we do of many other thingsof the union of our souls and bodies particularly in which we all believe  There are some passages of scripture again which have been thought more refractorywith regard for instance to the foreknowledge of God and such doctrines as are supposed to be involved in it For myself I own I find little difficulty in bringing all these pas∣sages to the apostle's test of comparison But if any of them should be thought more un∣yielding  instead of reasoning upon them we might still content ourselves with  comparing spiritual things with spiritual  Tho we may not be able to obtain compleat satisfaction from a comparison with  particular passages  we may surely obtain it from a comparison  with the whole scheme  of the gospel The gospel was intended for the general good of man and God's arbitrary will can never run counter to his revealed will  We act thus in common life Suppose we look into a medical book for the remedy of some particular disorder and should there find it prescribed that we should mix a cer∣tain quantity of some drug a quantity which we know would prove fatal with other ingre∣dientshow should we receive such a prescription we know well that the book is intended to administer to our health but here is a prescription which would infallibly destroy us We should take it for granted thereforeeither that the drug in question was put by mistake for some other drugor if the book were foreign that it was wrongly translatedor that there was some mistake in the quantity perhapsor perhaps that we might not clearly understand the prescription  at any rate we should certainly never swallow the potion because it was very plain that the intention of the book and the prescription must agree  Thus the apostle's rule of comparing  spiri∣tual things with spiritual  will in all cases direct us right One part will generally ex∣plain another but if any part happen to be more unyielding we cannot be far wrong if we compare the difficulty whatever it is with the general scheme and intention of the gospel  But there is one difficulty still behind which is the greatest of alland that is to bring our minds honestly to the application of this rule The mind when we examine a difficulty of scripture should be blank paper Alas how often is it already scribbled over with  the words of man's wisdom  Each of us hath his favourite systemthe pride of all his studious hoursand in nothing does selfdeceit triumph more than in giving these favourite systems the gloss of scripture It is the most difficult thing in the world to take the eye from some favourite point and give it a general cast And yet without this no judgment can be formed  In examining the works of man as well as of God we must judge from the  whole  or our judgment will be erroneous In archi∣tecture for instance should a man stand close to a column and pronounce boldly that it was too large or too small we see at once how absurd a judgment he might pass Whereas if he should step back a little take a proper stand and view the whole in one comprehensive view he might perhaps find that the part objected to was in exact proportion and the defect not in the object but in himselfIt is often thus in our scrip∣tural inquiries we take a doctrine from a text  And here I cannot help lamenting the sin∣gular illusage which the scriptures have met with in being frittered into chapter and verse with so little attention to the sense It is astonishing that the unauthorised barbarism of a printer  Robert Stephens who was printing a concordance and a bible at the same time and took this method of adapting the one to the other  I cannot give it a softer name tho he was certainly an able and a learned man should be received so universally through christendom The only advantage which  this strange interruption of the sense of scrip∣ture  can  have might just have been answered as well by marginal references In the mean time the mischief is glaring The narrative or the argument instead of running on like other compositions in a continued discourse is broken into aphorisms In other books the paragraph ends where the sense makes a pause In the bible whatever the sense is it ends at every third or fourth line Passages thus insulated receive an independent form The sense in each little paragraph seems drawn to a point and the  unlettered  reader at least is apt to pause Whereas if he went on and took all together he would find he must often affix a very different meaning to the words  I have frequently heard for instance a verse at the beginning of the st epistle of St Peter  Elect according to the foreknowledge of God  alledged as an irrefragable argument in favour of predestination But if this verse were added to the preceding one from which it is violently separated it would appear that the  whole people  of Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia are all  the elect according to the foreknowledge of God  Now it is absurd in the last degree to suppose that the  whole  bulk  of these several nations were in a state of salvation at the same time it is perfectly evan∣gelical to conceive them all invited to partake of the privileges of the gospel  according to the foreknowledge of God  that is according to the predictions of the prophets  That this is the sense to be affixed to the  foreknowledge of God  is evident from the tenth verse in which we are told that the  prophets prophesied of the grace that should come unto the Gentiles  and if after so many breaks we may be allowed to bring the seventeenth verse into the argument we are there told plainly that  God without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work    Few judicious churchmen I suppose would wish for a new translation of the bible It could not soon acquire that general reverence which is paid to the old one But many per∣haps would desire to see the errors of the old one corrected tho with as little alteration as possible The several late collations of MSS would render this I should think no very difficult work If however the wisdom of our superiors see any insuperable obstacle in going so far one should suppose at least there could be none in detaching chapters and verses into the margin They are certainly unauthorised intruders  Having thus considered the passage of scrip∣ture I undertook to discourse on and touched  tho very slightly a very important subjectso important and so often transgressed that frequent hints upon it can never be out of seasonI shall just add a few remarks on the difference between  holding  an error and  teaching  one  Error is inseparable from the mind of man  Humanum est errare  was the honest confession of nature and a state of grace points out the melancholy truth with still greater force We humbly hope therefore that as man and error are so closely united God will pardon our innocent errorsI mean such errors as have no connection with guilt  But yet our errors tho innocent as far as we ourselves are concerned may to others be the source of great mischief While they continue our own thoughts they affect no∣body but when we suffer them to get abroad they become cloathed in wordsand perhaps in such words as the text calls  the words of man's wisdom  Thus many excellent men I doubt not may have carried the doctrine of faith too high  Them  it injured not every christian virtue perhaps flowing from it In  their  minds therefore however erroneous the opinion it  may still be innocentBut they may fall into a very egregious mistake if they suppose from their own pious feelings that this doctrine has always the same effect on others It may create selfdelusion I should fear it might have a tendency to it and may make men satisfied with themselves Faith is an easy substitute for a good life  Faith  they are sure they have and as to  works  they hear them always spoken of as of no value which it is possible they may be too apt to apply in their own way so all is well It is cer∣tainly a very dangerous thing to speak slightly of  works  lest we should give a handle to the natural pravity of human nature  Thus again with regard to the other im∣portant subject on which I touched as there are many passages of scripture relating to the humanity of Christ as well as his divinity I cannot persuade myself as some pious people have done that an  exact  faith on this head is necessary to salvation Numbers I have no doubt will be saved through the merits of Christ who conceive him only as their law∣giver and conscientiously obey his laws tho they may not have those exalted ideas of his divine nature to which our scriptural rule I  think so directly leads If their holy lives have attained the principal end of a better faith they ought not surely to be branded with hard names and considered among those  who deny Christ before men  We are sometimes told they ought because without this exalted faith in the divine nature of a Saviour the mind cannot attain those elevated heights of love which the gospel prescribes  One should think so indeed but before we pass these harsh censures on others let any of us who do hold that doctrine ask our own carnal hearts whether it purify them in this exalted manner  At the same time I think we have good ground to censure those who publicly raise scruples Why cannot they be satisfied with keeping their opinions at home  When a man holds a religious opinion with such conscientious firmness that he gives up his temporal interests for it's sake tho the opinion may be erroneous the man is virtuous his character respectableBut if instead of suffering manfully for his opinion he should set it up as a banner and call people together under it he should then I think look well to his motives There may be a touch of  latent vanitythere may be an overweening of himselfthe pride of being at the head of a sectan oblique view to selfinterest perhaps or some other undue motive which may insinuate itself without well looking after into his religious views To  propagate  any error is dangerousbut on disputable motives it is doubly so A man is no way put upon it of course he is answerable for the conse∣quence On a question of philosophy indeed where an airpump or a crucible is concerned it matters little but where religion is the subject it becomes a point of moment To be silent is at least safe There can be no harmand I think no great share of modesty in keeping an opinion to yourself which has always been opposed by a great majority and some of the wisest and best men both laymen and churchmen that ever lived  But it is said the examination of truth can do no harm  None in the world to the truth itself None to the candid and able examiner of it But to the undistinguishing many it may often do great harm Indeed I know nothing of a more delicate nature than the management of a polemical controversy To answer a bold  charge seems necessary But to  keep up the spirit  of a dispute by continually replying to an opponent who is determined never to yield seems more than is necessary It may unset∣tle the minds of wellmeaning people It may lead them from things of more conse∣quence It may be offensive to see churchmen continually wrangling about points of religion And tho these points may often be of little moment in themselves yet they who know less may think essentials concerned and the gospel itself of an unstable natureBesides I should always fear that what was gained in argument would be lost in piety in charity most undoubtedly Holy wars have ever been the worst of wars and scriptural debates the most intemperateAnd what end is gained They rarely convince People generally hold their own opinions and the matter ends as it began  Dr Priestley very justly observes that  there is but little reason to expect that any man who has given the public his opinion on any subject of importance will ever retract it  See his Disquisitions page  And as to any concern for the souls of men in pure charity one should think they will not alledge this If we allow sal∣vation  to their faith they may surely be as condescending to ours  After all the world hath had enough on these subjects There is not one of them which hath not been over and over debated We have only the old argument dressed up anew The sceptical inquirer cannot possibly mistake his way The road is tracked by many wheels and needful guideposts are every where set up From the knowledge abroad in the world he may easily find abun∣dance to satisfy all his enquiries  The great conclusion from the whole is that the ministers of religion cannot be too cautious in avoiding the words which  man's wisdom teacheth  nor too careful  in comparing spiritual things with spiritual  Polemical divinity no doubt hath a tendency to lead us aside The great point before us is very different Instead of employing our time on the difficult topics of the gospel which con∣cern few it would serve the cause of the gospel better to endeavour by every means as we are best able to inculcate the important truths of religion which so much concern us allthe intention and necessity of itit's graces and high offersit's means of puri∣fying  our natureit's conditions and awful sanctions These are truths which tho well known require daily inculcating and placing in various lights On examining therefore the whole intention and tenor of the gos∣pelon  comparing spiritual things with spi∣ritual  we must be convinced that the great∣est service we can do to religionand the best obedience we can shew to the gospel consists in our uniting in a conscientious en∣deavour to draw a corrupt age to the prac∣tice of godliness  keeping that which is com∣mitted to our trust and avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called which too often spoil men through philosophy and vain deceit after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ  END OF THE FIRST SERMON  SERMON II  ON The Simplicity of the Gospel  TO THE REVEREND DR STURGES CHANCELLOR OF THE DIOCESE OF WINCHESTER THIS SERMON IS INSCRIBED BY HIS MOST OBEDIENT AND VERY HUMBLE SERVANT WILLIAM GILPIN  COR xi  I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ  ONE of the first great objects of aposto∣lical fear in the matter of religious corruption was judaism The earliest converts were Jews and they could not at once be brought to acknowledge the  simplicity that is in Christ  Deep prejudices had taken root the authority of Mosestheir peculiar privilegesthe grandeur of their templeand splendor of it's worship had gotten posses∣sion of their earliest conceptions and had filled their minds with ideas which were not easily erased by the simplicity of the gospel  But tho judaism was the primary object of the apostle's fear the passage before us leads  us to suppose his apprehensions had here taken another turn and were rather directed to the temptations of the worldWe may consider it indeed if we please as prophecy It has certainly the most genuine mark of prophecy it has been exactly fulfilled The simplicity of the gospel in it's first age could not be more corrupted by judaism than it has been since by a concurrence of other mischievous causes  In the following discourse I shall just touch upon a few of those causes pointed out by the apostle which have corrupted the  simpli∣city that is in Christ  and I shall then inquire what part the ministers of the gospel should take in this matter It is a subject neither new nor curious But if it be a common subject it is at least a very interesting one and can neither be too often reviewed nor too deeply impressed  In order to see how the simplicity that is in Christ hath been corrupted it may be necessary to inquire first in what it consists But the apostle hath not defined it and there∣fore  we may suppose we are to gather a de∣finition of it for ourselves  Whoever reads the holy scriptures with the meek spirit of a learner will feel the meaning of the expression better than any logical dis∣tinctions can explain it to him He will feel the  simplicity that is in Christ  growing upon him more and more as he becomes more intimately acquainted with the scriptures and by degrees taking possession of his understand∣ing and affectionshe will feel a disposition forming itself in his mind free from the pre∣judices of any sectyet indulgent to the opi∣nions of allopen to convictionand above disingenuous cavilzealous in searching for the truthbut gentle in maintaining itequally ready to correct an error and to acknowledge it He will feel that the simplicity which is in Christ will form his  heart  as well as his  faith and opinions  He will not allow the precepts of religion to be refined by the glosses of the worldnor accommodated to it's fashionsnor considered as speculative points His faith will be a directing prin∣ciple which raises him above the world above it's hopesabove it's fearsand forms  him into a chearful passenger through this state of trial animated only by those holy hopes which the gospel inspires  That there are now and have been in all ages many  individuals  who may in a certain degree be thus characterized we have no doubt But where shall we find the  national character  of a people under this description In early days when christians were of  one heart and one soul  we may suppose that heart and soul were truly christian But it was at a time when we read they had  all things in common  When the necessary distinc∣tions of society began to take place then began also among christians an opposition between the spirit of the world and the  simplicity that is in Christ  This simplicity was in a degree tainted even before the miraculous powers of the church ceased and we may be assured the mischievous spirit which then ap∣peared has not been idle through so long a tract of time but hath continued extending it's influence in some countries more in others less according to the various circumstances of each The New Testament is the record of the simplicity of the gospel and modern  history but above all ecclesiastical history is the record of it's corruption  The apostle of the text is writing to the converts of a trading and opulent town not barbarous and uninformed but inlightened by all the philosophy and worldly wisdom at that time in esteem He foresaw what temptations their peculiar circumstances would draw them into Worldly ideas of various kindsvanity pride and ambitionavarice profusion and sensuality in a word all the arts of raising a fortune and all the arts of consuming one he knew would be conti∣nually operating before their eyes and how the simplicity of the gospel might be able to oppose these fascinating delusions was the object of his fear  Again it might be in equal danger from the refinements of philosophy and the acute reasonings of learned men who trying it's simple principles by canons of human inven∣tion and rules of logical exactness would from these pronounce boldly on it's inconsistences and defects  The simplicity of the gospel might be power∣fully opposed too by the ridicule of men of  wit who taking their topics of comparison from the fashions and practices of the world might display the folly and absurdity of such doctrines as they were inclined to discoun∣tenance  All this was perfectly easy for as christi∣anity and the world were at variance argu∣ments drawn from the world and addressed to the world were sure of being favourably heard  That these were the motives of the apostle's apprehension is very plain for he tells his converts he fears they should be corrupted as  the serpent had beguiled Eve  To know therefore how that matter stood we need only turn to the record of the fatal deed  When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eye and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat  Short as this account is we find in it a combination of interest pleasure vanity and a false taste for knowledge all cooperating through the wiles of the devil to impose upon our first parent With these delusions she was corrupted and with these delusions we  conclude the apostle feared his Corinthian converts might be corrupted also  How far our case may be similar to that of the Corinthian converts I should rather leave as matter of inference All I wish to establish on  this head  is that we are assured on the authority of an apostle that the  simpli∣city which is in Christ  may be corrupted by such temptations as certainly  do  abound amongst usin our mannersin our amusementsin our literary pursuits and in our general modes of intercourse with each other  Some theorists may amuse themselves with an opinion that religion is in a progressive state It is at least a pleasing theoryand in one sense no doubt a very just one If we believe in prophecy we must believe that the gospel will not only spread over the face of the earth but that it's present state is a kind of preparation for that glorious state of which we obtain a  general conception  from the apoca∣lypse of St John tho the lofty figures em∣ployed in that description leave the  detail  ob∣scure  But notwithstanding this  general progress  of the gospel we may suppose it's light to be some∣times  obscured in particular countriesor in the apostle's language it's  simplicity corrupted  On this head I fear the general prevailing manners of our own country will not stand a scriptural test  As the ministers of the gospel make a part of this tainted mass we must not flatter our∣selves that we are not in a degree corrupted also We read in early days of  deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ  and we cannot conceive that these  deceitful workers  are more uncommon now or these  transformations  more rare I mean not however at present to pursue so ingrateful a theme I should rather wish to inquire how far we have it in our power to counteract such corruption  Even to oppose this torrent with any success no doubt may be difficult enough To re∣store the simplicity of the gospel is a vain thought For that great event we must wait devoutly for those times to which I have just alluded when all offence shall be done away  Some things may be wrong which the legislature only can rectify and tho we ac∣knowledge  the difficulty of moving these sacred foundations yet favourable opportunities may perhaps arise in future time when a few things which are now rather offensive may be brought nearer the simplicity of the gospel Many of our ablest churchmen have freely ex∣pressed their wishes on this head and as these wishes become more general they will of course obtain more weight Establishments however after all necessary as they are must  necessarily  bring on their attendant evils which serious men may bemoanand in  part  may rectify but on the  whole  they will ever have cause to lament that the  nature of things  in this corrupt state is mixed with eviland that the  nature of man  will turn even his blessings into mischief  We have also greatly to lament that the man∣ners of the great are in general so far removed from the simplicity of the gospel because the manners of the great will ever be the principal source of national manners It is a happiness however that in general these vitiated scenes are removed from the eyes of the people and yet enough sometimes gets abroad to astonish those who happily live at a distance from them There is one day  particularly on which the great and little world are in some degree on a level and one place in which they meet on an equal footing We have it ever to lament that so pleasing a har∣monyan institution so delightfully calculated to insure benevolence by united devotion through the whole mass of the people should be so generally disregarded Even the very poli∣tical use of this sacred institution if it had no other were sufficient to inforce a general observance of it on all who have a love for public order But the great should consider farther that if  they  have no need of instruction their  inferiors  at least have who are al∣ways ready on this and every occasion to shew their betters how much they approve and value the bad examples they set them  Let things however be wrong in what de∣gree they willlet the great and little world unite in treating the  simplicity that is in Christ  with what contempt they please it is still our part to do our best to preserve it and to keep the remains of religion as far as we can and as long as we can subsisting amongst us Tho the  whole head is sick and the heart faint  and the physician's best skill can only palliate it is always something to go so far  Our blessed Saviour calls the ministers of the gospel  the salt of the earth  It is a most expressive figure It shews not only that there will be great corruption in the earth but it shews farther that the ministers of the gospel are the means which God has appointed to oppose this corruption Tho our influence cannot preserve the whole yet still it may preserve a part Tho we may have no effect on the general bulk of mankind yet there may be many an individual whose honest heart we may retain in the simplicity of the gospel  We are not legislators and things would not go on better if we were The only means which we have to employ in this matter lie in two easy words our  doctrine  and our  manners  in both of which it should be our utmost endeavour to attain as far as we can and to impress upon others the  sim∣plicity that is in Christ  The former we must endeavour to preserve from the corruptions of  worldly wisdom  the latter from the corrup∣tions of  worldly fashions  To  explain the word of God  is certainly the most arduous business in which the reason of man can engage Every explanation of the  sacred text is in fact putting our own sense upon the words of scripture and when we consider the very supine ignorance of the ge∣nerality of the common people who take their ideas of religion from  what we tell them  it is certainly a very awful thought and should make us endeavour to keep as close as possible to the  simplicity that is in Christ  It is in vain to attempt this without a thorough acquaintance with scripture which will always suggest such passages to the me∣mory as on a comparison with the subject we are upon may direct us to the true scrip∣tural sense  The lawyer is obliged to study with at∣tention a number of books and to examine a variety of parallel cases before he can be qualified to act in his profession The physi∣cian is under the same necessity And is it not a mortifying consideration that because the common people are obliged to take our prescriptions just as we please to prescribe we should for that reason prescribe carelesly and without sufficiently consulting that book which alone will enable us to do it pro∣perly  Some think the  simplicity that is in Christ  consists in cloathing their sentiments always in  scripturephrase  I see no more reason for this than for going about as the apostles did in sandals with a scrip and a staff Modes of speech are just as much the fashion of times and countries as modes of dress and need be as little observed The scriptural mode of speech is highly figurativevery dif∣ferent from any mode now in use and re∣quires translation as much as the original Greek It is the  scriptural idea  not the  scriptural mode of expression  for which I am contending and this may be lost in many ways It may be narrowed to speak the opinions of a sector it may be widened to speak the opinions of the worldor it may be lost in morals when instead of preaching plainly and simply on gospelsubjects our discourses with scriptural mottoes affixed are short immethodical essays in which the be∣ginning can hardly be distinguished from the endnor indeed what is aimed at till the book is closed just as the audience may sup∣pose the subject will open  There is another thing also which often occasions our erring from the  simplicity which is in Christ  As the gospel is a covenant be∣tween God and man it touches of course on such things as relate to both As far as it relates to God it is no doubt a deep mysterious subject but as far as it relates to man nothing can be more simple and easy Hence it is that our religion without any contradiction of terms peace be to all scep∣tical cavils is sometimes called the  mystery of godliness  and sometimes  the simplicity of the gospel  It is the  mystery of godliness  as it relates to God's part in this gracious plan and the  simplicity of the gospel  as it relates to us To the want of sufficient attention to this easy distinction perhaps arise not only many of the disputes and misconceptions and infu∣sions of worldly wisdom which have so often dis∣graced the gospel but also much of that strange unaccountable confusion of ideas that perplexes and confounds the understanding of the lower people If the lost condition of manhis restoration and redemption by Christthe necessity of a holy lifethe tendency of the  gospel to make him happy both here and hereafterand other plain points had gene∣rally been the subjects of popular discourses we should not have had now that gross ig∣norance in matters of religion and that va∣riety of strange notions and prejudices to com∣bat which we find amongst the common people on all religious subjects but especi∣ally on the sacrament of the Lord's supper As nothing is more difficult than to eradicate old prejudices nothing would have been more easy than to have prevented their getting ground at first The plain truths of the gospel might have descended just as easily as misconception and error  It should be our care then to accommodate our doctrine as much as we can to the  sim∣plicity that is in Christ  not to dwell upon it's  mysterious parts  not to enter into the in∣quiries how and whynor to clog it with difficult or refined questions against which the apostle to Timothy long ago took abun∣dant pains to guard us but to preach it as we are directed with plainnessto lay the stress on it's obvious truthsand when we  have occasion to mention a mysterious point one of those great points which relate to God's part in the covenant of grace rather than to man's to be very careful of going too farto keep as close as possible to scrip∣ture lest we make a difficulty more difficult by endeavouring to explain what cannot be explained The less in general that is said on such points the betterOne thing we should always remember and that is to adapt our discourses to the  lower  rather than the  higher  parts of our audience that we may like good ministers dispense that gospel whose peculiar characteristic it was to  be preached to the poor  I shall close this head with the account which an ancient heathen of the fourth century gives of the mode of preaching the gospel in his day  The christian philosophy says he is very simple It's principal concern is to regulate the manners of men and to infuse worthy notions of the Deity Ob∣scure questions and nice arguments it avoids Nor does it enter into the nature and foundation of virtue but exhorts in a general way to the practice of it which  experience shews us is more effectual among the vulgar  See Lardner's Testimonies from Alexander of Lycopolis Vol IV p    Tho this honest heathen had not a com∣pleat idea of christianity he seems however to have had so good a notion of it that many christian pastors might take a lesson from him  Our  manners  should be as simple as our  doctrine  But you ask what is simplicity of manners It is a phrase of ambiguous meaning  Let us not here again puzzle ourselves with definitions They who seek for close definitions on these subjects I should fear seek rather for evasion than information The scriptures have little to do with definitions On these subjects they speak to the heart more than to the head Whoever reads with a desire to learn the instructions which our Saviour and his apostles give to the ministers of the gospel will soon feelunless indeed it be a point which he wishes to overlook  not only in what the simplicity of our man∣ners should consistbut also that it should be our first and most indispensible care  And the reason of the thing as we are preachers of the gospel is plain because the simplicity of our manners must give force to what we say It is not every body with his best endeavour who can get hold of the properest method of communicating his ideas or can practice that mode of application in his dis∣courses either publicly or privately which may have the best effect upon the people But simplicity of manners is a mode of preach∣ing which makes up many defectsit is adapted to every capacityevery body under∣stands it and it adds a dignity and conse∣quence even to a discourse of less weight Tho the common people are no good reason∣ers there is however one mode of reasoning at which they are very readythat of inferring  doctrine  from  manners  and they will not only make the latter a test of the former but they will in general pay more attention to it like∣wise  When the city of Antioch was disposed to receive the gospel and the apostle Barnabas was sent from Jerusalem to promote the good  work which was there carrying on the peo∣ple seem to have been particularly influenced by his holy life  for he was a good man  says the apostolical historian  and full of the Holy Ghost and of faithand much people was added unto the Lord  On the other hand the purest doctrine will lose it's effect among the common people at least in proportion as they see their mi∣nister pay less attention to it himself That apostolical apostrophe  Thou that preachest to others teachest thou not thyself  will ever be the language of popular contempt  There is another kind of contempt also which every consistent man would particularly wish to avoidand that is his own contempt of himself What must that man's feelings be whose life is spent in a continued variance with those truths which he is  obliged to preach  who must tell his hearers of governing their undue affections and yet lets his own loose in all the vanities of a dissipated age who must talk of the world as a pilgrimage while every action of his life shews it to be his carnal home who is obliged to preach the glories of a future state and the joys of heaven while his own happiness is plainly  centered in worldly ambition and worldly attentionsContempt abroad may be borne if a man feel from the uprightness of his own heart that he does not deserve it but there is no refuge from contempt withinunless a man is past feeling and sets at defiance the remonstrances even of common decency  How far  the minister of the gospel should keep at a distance from the worldfrom it's ambitious viewsit's interestsand it's partycontentions  how far  he should stand aloof from it's pleasures and abstain from many amusements which tho perhaps innocent in themselves may at least when countenanced by him have a tendency to  break down the fences  of religion are questionsnot proper indeed for me to determine but very proper for every churchman to examine seriously in his own conscience It is becoming surely that the ministers of a religion which so in∣tirely disclaims the world should endeavour at least not to be much intangled in it A morose character is not the alternative Cheer∣fulness is the natural companion of religion Sourness is an alien intruder Amusements too are necessary but I am not singular in thinking those amusements should rather be  of the retired kind than sought for amidst the noise and bustle of the world Riot and excess generally attend the amusements of a number of people assembled with a purpose of being joyous and what none would do alone is not scrupled perhaps where the  im∣propriety  which by the way deserves often a severer name is divided among a multitude In scenes like these the clerical  habit  is a blot the clerical  character  a still greater I would not be thought harsh I would not be thought uncomplying The world I know is often shocked at hearing the precepts of the gospel opposed in all their plainness to the elegant fashions which it adopts and we are sometimes almost afraid in our popu∣lar discourses of opening gospeltruths so fully as we might lest by saying more than the times will bear we should injure a cause which we wish to advance Our blessed Lord himself was often obliged to speak in parables But let the world if it please be the  deaf adder which stoppeth it's ears  there need be no apology surely for recommending gospeltruths in the plainest manner to the ministers of the gospel  But the clerical character may be a check upon improprieties  I should fear not much As we have the example however of our blessed Lord who kept company with publicans and sinners with a view to reform them nothing farther can be said if this be the  real motive  tho to me it appears risking more than the pro∣bability of advantage will insure  After all my brethren it may be an easy matter in an age of licence to  satisfy  our∣selvesif we make the  comparison only with others  but I hope this is a kind of  satisfaction  and a kind of  comparison  in which none of us would willingly acquiesce We talk of sectaries and novel teachers and cry  the people have itching ears  Would to God no blame in this matter may rest upon ourselves To speak with truth and candour there does not seem in general to be so much simplicity and propriety of manners amongst  us  as there appears to be amongst several of our  dissenting brethren  But propriety of manners is the dissenter's chief support It is his worldly engine and therefore his  motives  may be as worldly as ours  They may or may not be for any thing we know We have nothing to do with any motives but our own It concerns us more to consider whether certain truths lie not nearer home Whether the establish∣ed churchman declines the  heat of the day  because his wages are double Whether he spend his superfluity on the vanities of life because those wages are abundantor whe∣ther his manners are more lax because those wages are more certain  The harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are few  was a com∣plaint of great authority in very early days Things are not mended I should suppose now It is inconceivable how wrong the spiritual affairs of a parish get in a little time Habits of vice and inattention to every thing serious make a quick progress A few careless pastors succeeding each other leave a parish in a state of heathenism and it must be a work of time and labourof length of time of accumu∣lated labour to recover it from it's supineness A generation may be lost and no hope left but in a rising oneWhereas if the care of one minister succeeded to that of another each uniting simplicity of doctrine with sim∣plicity  of manners in a few years a great change might be wrought  Thus my brethren I have given you my thoughts on a subjectnot very recondite indeed but very interesting It is a serious businessa business too in which we have all voluntarily engaged We have all  put our hands to the plough  and we know the conse∣quence of  looking back  Let us then cheer∣fully proceed evermore uniting our prayers with our endeavours that God would of his infinite mercy grant we may  both by our  PREACHING  and  LIVING SET FORTH  his holy word and  SHEW
