ESSEX  THE FLITCH OF BACON  ACT I  SCENE  a Green  The Curtain rising discovers  Tipple  on a Ladder hanging a  FLITCH OF BACON  upon the Arm of an old Oak  Putty  the Glazier painting the Names of the Candidates on the Stocks  CHORUS OF VILLAGERS  RISING with the sun to labor  Blithe like him we spend the day  When he set  the merry tabor  Bids us frolic sport and play  Tip  There it is And as fine a flitch as any in this hundred or the next now let 'em win it and snack it say I  Put  Why they say as how Master Tipple that they been your tiptop gentry that are coming down to swear for it  Tip  Ay like enough neighbour Putty for nowadays  they  may swear through a church door and nobody must not say nay to 'em  Put  We hears there's to be rare doings howsever  Tip  Plenty of the big beer stirring today why his worship has given me orders that no throat shall be dry thro' the whole hamlet  All  Rare news indeed  Tip  So bundle along my lads and lassesclap your best foot foremost Get your halfday's work done and ere night you shall be all as merry as grigs    Exeunt singing the Chorus  SCENE  a Room in the Justice's House  Enter  Justice  Just  No tidings yet of the arrival of the candidates  Serv  None at all Sir  Just  Surely I have not mistaken the day Let me see    Takes a Letter from his Pocket and reads    "A young couple named Lionel and Elizabeth Greville intend to claim the honourable reward due to their conjugal fidelity on Thursday next the th of July"  And glad I a  in this age of divorces separations and devil'  that there is any conjugal fidelity at all to  d    Reads on    "Being able to conform to all the ceremonies in that case made and provided according to the charter of Dunmow Priory"  No it's right enough I see    After a Pause    This which will prove a day of festivity to the whole country is to me a sad memento of my daughter's disobedience and my own rashness Perhaps even now when by the custom of my manor I am about to reward the love and constancy of this happy pair my own poor girl may be the wife of an unfeeling tyrant and the child of penury on a foreign shore Why  did I in the bitterness of my wrath refuse to see herBut then was there not a provocationTo elope to France and that with a young rake of an officer whom I never beheld  Enter  Tipple  Tip  Your servant your worship  Just  Well Tipple what news have you brought  Tip  Only that all's done as your worship orderedFooh fooh how woundly hot it is this morning My mouth is so parch'd and my throat so dry  Just    Smiling    The old hint for a morning draught Eh TippleHere William bring a tankard of strong beer  Tip  Ah your worship's a sensible kind of a body you can see the wants of a poor man with half an eye and loves to relieve 'embut as for your neighbour Dr Stingy our Wicar I never see the man that could tell whether he brew'd with pale malt or brown and that's a monstrous shame for a clargyman  Enter Servant with a Tankard  Just  Come take your liquor Tipple and you'll proceed the better  Tip    After drinking    The rich don't want it but it does mend a poor man's spirits sure enoughWell then your worship the Flitch is hung up on the arm of the old oak and a choice one it is 'twas one of the last litter of the old carroty sow it weighs twenty stone at least and better stuff nedid man stick knife intoOh and Nat Putty the glazier too has finished painting the names of the  candidates upon the stocks according to the canon law of the manor  Just  That's all very well You must now go and find out my brother the Major and tell him I shall be glad of his company to dinner notwithstanding our little pet this morning  Tip  I will your worship but I am glad his honour the Major is not to be  jocum tenus  for your worship he's so much upon the roguish order with the women now and ten I did not care to mention it to your worship before but as true as I'm alive he was a little rombustical to our Bridget no longer ago than last Sunday was se'night as she was coming home from church  Just  Ay no doubt for his head runs of nothing else but fighting and wenching from morning to night though he'll meet with his match one day or other take my word for it But it's a little strange methinks Tipple that in the course of so many centuries no couple of our own family should have claimed this matrimonial honor  Tip  Mayhap your worship they thought their own bacon too fat for 'em and would not sit easy on their stomachs  Just  So it should seem Tipple    Smiling    well do you hear any thing of the happy couple who or what they are  Tip  No your worshipMy wife Bridget thinks as how they been Londoners now for my part I takes it to be a Lord and his spouse such a mort of folk have been flocking from all parts to see 'em and such a woundly sight of chaiseses and fine cattle been come to the Red Cow and Green Man alreadyOh I'm certain it must be a lord  Just  Oh that can't be  Tip  Why not your worship  Just  Because these are not the days Tipple for coronets and conjugal affection to take a trip together to  Dunmow Priory  besides the lady has desired the privilege of being veiled a modest sign seldom or never to be found among the great folks Tipple depend on't  Tip  Modest not they efecks they'd sooner stare poor folk out of countenance than give 'em any thing  Just  Well said Tipple A pretty correct portrait of our modern peerage  Tip  To tell your worship the truth I'm not over and above fond of 'em  SONG  awkwardly imitating the Maccaronies  TIPPLE  Oh a gay flashy lord is a woundy sine sight  Who is ne'er to be seen but with owls in the night  Then so slight here behind  He's blown thro' by the wind  So cropp'd  And belopp'd  Such timber so limber from top to the toe  That he wriggles and nods as he walks to and fro  I ne'er see'd but one in the course of my life  And him I had lick'd but for Bridget my wife  I laugh'd at his pride  And the spit by his side  Good lack  His long back  Like a building so weak is it hardly can stand  But would snap short in two like a twig in this hand    Exe  SCENE  a Grove Drum beats  Grevill Wilson  and  Eliza  discovered in disguis  as a recruiting Party  GLEE  ese lines being a kind of parody on those of the old  same irregularity of measure was obliged to be pre  TRIO  How merrily we live that soldiers be  Round the world thus we march with merry glee  On the pleasant downs sometimes encamp'd we lie  No cares we know but Fortune's frowns defy  So long as we can see our colours fly  Grev  Under this disguise we are arrived within gun shot of the fort the fort which about this time twelvemonth I sack'd of thee Eliza its dearest treasure  Eliza  From which you mean I voluntarily deserted to the enemyHeigho  Grev  Come come you promis'd when we embarked from Calais on this enterprize to give all these womanish fears to the wind  Wil  You who made so light of the stormy terrors of the sea to sink now at the prospect of success  Eliza  Alas you neither of you know the difference between that and the present conflict  AIR  ELIZA  The pow'rs that agitate the seas  And bid the billows roar  Can calm them into bounds of peace  And make them kiss the shore  But I who rais'd and left the storm  To wreck a parent's breast  Can ne'er approach his dreaded form  To bless him or be blest  Grev  Prithee love take courage let this inspire thee    Kissing her  Wil  As the cordial seems to revive her don't be sp  ing of them but give her another and we shall be proof against any thing  Eliza  The deuce take you You all know well enough how to enslave us while a poor woman's conquest generally ceases with the novelty of her charms  Grev  Never with the man of common sense or integrity my Eliza depend on't  AIR  GREVILLE  No'twas neither shape nor  eature  Made me own thy sov'reign sway  Ev'n thine the proudest gifts of nature  Could have triumph'd but a day  Beauty's graces tho' inviting  Scarce the ravish'd sense will bind  But with Virtue's charms uniting  Steal Love's fetters o'er the mind  Wil  Oh the drum I see has brought Ned to us  Enter  Ned  Grev  Well Ned how does the land lie  Ned  Rarely Sir every thing goes as your heart cou'd wish  Eliza  And how does my dear father Ned  Ned  Oh pure and hearty Madam  Eliza  Thank Heaven  Grev  Did the old gentleman hesitate at all to comply with the demand in my letter  Ned  Not in the least Sir for when he read it  he only sigh'd and said Heaven forbid he should withhold the reward due to honourable love  Eliza  Heaven then reward his generous feelings How I long my Greville once more to behold this best of fathers and of men  Grev  So neither he nor his brother the old Major have the least suspicion of our scheme you are sure Ned  Ned  None in the world Sir His worship wanted much to know who the couple were but he seemed satisfied at last when I told him they desired it might be kept a secret and has consented that you Madam should appear veil'd before him not to put your modesty to the blush  Grev  Run then to the corner of the lane there where the postcoach stands take out the cloakbag pay the drivers and return to us immediately    Exit  Ned  Eliza  I begin now to be more afraid of my uncle's obstinacy than any thing else for his consent you know is as necessary as my father's for the recovery of my fortune  Wil  If that's all your fear make yourself perfectly easy for a little plot has just struck me that cannot fail I think to operate effectually upon him if I understand his character at all in which you must not only assist without a murmur but act a principal part    To  Eliza  Eliza  You may be sure my assistance will not be wanting but what is it I'm all impatience till I know it  Wil  Why what think you of my bringing you together for you to make a conquest of the old oneeyed dotard who you say can't see the length of his nose and then leave it to your wit and goodsense to turn it to a proper advantage  Eliza  I cannot divine what end this can possibly answer  Wil  Oh the best in the world that of betraying him into so ridiculous a situation that he shall readily assent to any terms you may propose to save himself from becoming the derision of the whole country  Eliza  Why I must confess I do not see any great difficulty in effecting thisfor the Major is a hungry fish that rises at every fly and if I can muster up spirits enough I don't fear but I should be able to hook him  Grev  Bravo I like the plot amazingly  Eliza  But if he should begin to be violent and talk nonsense to me  Wil  Why then you've only to shut your ears and run away from him but be sure you contrive it so that he may catch you again  Enter  Ned  with a Cloakbag c  Where is the likeliest place to fall in with the Major accidentally in his morning's ramble Ned  Ned  Oh Sir you may meet with him this very instant at the Red Cow upon the Green taking what he calls his morning's bever  Wil  If that's the case I'll make the attack immediately and as you have agreed to try the experiment Greville must attend you to this spot about two hours hence and then leave the rest to fortune and me  Eliza  I'll certainly attempt it tho' even with all the assistance of your friendship and invention rather doubtful of success  Wil  You know but little of these old dotards or  you would be satisfied how easy a matter it is to carry our plan into execution  AIR  WILSON  Tell me which of magic charms  Ev'ry earthly pow'r disarms  Young ones pleasing  Greybeards teasing  Setting fancy wild afloat  'Tis the snowwhite  Petticoat  Circled thus from prying eyes  Love's immortal witchcraft lies  And to bless us  Or distress us  Nature bids us fondly doat  On the snowwhite  Petticoat    Exeunt  SCENE  a

an army on the field of battle where I've seen fifty thousand alive and merry before breakfast and half of 'em dead on the spot before dinner and a damn'd fine sight let me tell you Tipple  Tip  Mercy on us  Maj  Many's the good time that I've seen the field covered with Frenchmen's blood and made so hot by our hissing ninepoundersthat one might have poach'd an egg in it  Tip    Whistling    Now he's off full gallop    Aside  Maj  Did I never tell you Tipple of my behaviour  at the battle of Crevelt where I lost the fellow to this eye  Tip  O la Yes your honour a thousand times  Maj  That's a damn'd confounded lie Tipple Besides if I had it would imprint it the stronger on your memory On the th of August just at break of day    Drum beats    what the devil's all this about  Tip  O lud the French  evasion  's certainly come  Maj  There's nothing new in that Tipple for the French always evade coming to blows as long as ever they can for my part I wish the Monsieurs would come over I should like to see a few of their whiskers on this side the water  Tip  Lud your honour how can you be so blasphemous Why should you  Maj  To train our Coxheath camp a little then our militia would eat their brown bread without grumbling and fight like lions for fear the hungry Frenchmen should eat it all up from 'emHere Kilderkin  Enter  Kilderkin  What the devil are we besieg'd here Kilderkin

If so I crave your honour's pardon  Maj  Shew me your beating order Sirshew me your beating order  Wil  An't please your honour the serjeant is gone to the justice's next the church to get it back'd

you neither one would suppose by your unsoldierlike conduct  Wil  It does not become a private man to boast of his exploits or I could convince your honour that I have seen some warm service and that when I was no higher than your honour's cane  Maj  Ay whatWhenWhere  Wil  I'll tell your honour  AIR  WILSON  From  Minden  's plains of glory  I date my warlike story  Where conquest never yet outdone  By British arms was nobly won  See old  Kingsley  's lads present  Revenge desiring  Incessant firing  On fame and Britain's glory bent  All our powder and ball expended  The Monsieurs thought the battle ended  Till with bayonets advancing  We quickly set their columns prancing  And to make our vict'ry good  Follow'd thro' a crimson flood    Da Capo  Tip  A marv'lous bloody story

want you  Tip  Ecod that's right your worship sound him to the bottom for he looks woundly like a spy or a Roman Papish    Making signals to each other    Exit  Tipple  Maj  What was it you was saying about a fine girl just now You may speak out my honest lad for nobody now can overhear us  Wil    Pondering    Fine girlO yes your honour I believe I did say something about the frolicksome young lady

longest night  Grev  By thee belov'd  Eliza  While blest with thee  Both    Stern Fate may frown in vain  Content and sweet Simplicity  Will take us in their train  Grev  Tho' my Eliza we did fly from parental tyranny and obeyed the call of Nature in following our own inclinations yet the reflection that we have violated no principle either of reason or virtue will ever preserve our domestic felicity  Eliza  Hence all doubt and fearsThe arguments of love and Greville are irresistible  Grev  To your post then for I see your uncle and Wilson ascending the hill I must withdraw therefore on the other side of the grove but whatever may  the issue of this experiment I shall wait to conduct you to the church where by oath you know we must qualify ourselves for the last and most serious scene of all  Eliza  To encounter the eyes of an offended father will be a trying scene indeed  Grev  Courage my love and success cannot fail to attend us    Kisses her and retires  Eliza  AdieuWell matters are now coming to a crisis indeedIt's well for me the old Major is purblind or I fear my confusion on his first approach would betray meBless me here he comes hobbling alongsuppose I lure him with my favourite air and thus decoy the old bird of prey by the very strains in which I love to recount my Greville's affection  AIR  ELIZA  Within this breast the record lies  Of all the vows he made  His lipsbut more his telltale eyes  His inmost soul betray'd  How could I shun the pleasing pain  When all my doubts were flown  Besides my blushes told the swain  My heart was not my own  The Major and  Wilson  enter just before the conclusion of the Air  Wil  A sweet little pipe a'n't she your honour  Maj  EnchantingBut where is the dear delightful little minx She's got of the blind side

less a man than Major Benbow of the train who formerly laid whole towns in ashes and left such beauteous damsels as you to weep the embers out  Eliza  Indeed Dear me what a brave man you must be  Maj  O that's nothing child to what I've been us'd tobut now my better fate ordains that I should sit down before the breastwork of your little  heart and never raise the siege as long as I have a tongue to summon it to surrender  Eliza  Ah me what an unfortunate girl am I who cannot shut my ears against the flattering tales of a gallant and agreeable manBut if you love me then as you say you do take me with you to see shew upon the Green  Maj  What my brother's damn'd  Flitch of Bacon  raree shew No that's rather too bad child besides it would not be so prudent for us to be seen together  Eliza  Your brother is he SirWhy sure then it's very good of him to encourage matrimony in this manner  Maj  Yes a very good kind of a fellow truly who shut his door in his own daughter's face only for doing the very thing that he is now going to reward in others  Eliza  That was unkind of him indeed  Maj  Unkind why he's the most flinthearted closefisted old dog in the whole hundred and quite the reverse of me tho' I'm his brother that say it  Eliza  What kind of a young lady was she Sir  Maj  Nothing to brag on love A chattering forward kind of minx who as soon as she began to feel her legs could not be held in by the strongest double rein'd bridle in her father's stable  Eliza  Pleasant all this    Aside    Was she pretty Sir  Maj  Oh no quite the reverseYou might have sworn she was the daughter of a grazier for she was large plump and red all over like an Essex calf  Eliza  A very flattering description truly    Aside  Maj  I mean when compared with such a sweet  delicate tempting morsel as you    Kissing her hand    But come my little angel we lose time yield at once to the addresses of a man trained in the field of honour who never fails to make a suitable return  Eliza  HeighoAnd when you have secured my affections perhaps you'll serve me as your brother did his daughter turn me out to the wide world to repent my folly and rashness  AIR  ELIZA  The heart the gallant soldier storms  Surrenders at discretion  To his command ev'n love conforms  And gains him quick possession  This silent grove  Abets your love  While you my heart trapan  Cease to woo me  You'll undo me  Too
