grievance of the matter is thisever since your honour differed with Justice Credilous our Inkeepers use us most scurvily By my halbert their treatment is such that if your  spirit  was willing to put up with it flesh and blood could by no means agree so we humbly petition that your honour would make an end of the matter at once by running away with the Justice's daughter or else get us fresh quarters hem hem  Lieu  IndeedPray which of the houses use you ill  st Sol  There's the Red Lion ha'n't half the civility of the old Red Lion  d Sol  There's the White Horse if he was'n't case hardened ought to be ashamed to shew his face  Lieu  Very well the Horse and the Lion shall answer for it at the quarter sessions  Ser  The two Magpies are civil enough but the Angel uses us like devils and the rising sun refuses us light to go to bed by  Lieu  Then upon my word I'll have the rising sun put down and the Angel shall give security for his good behaviour but are you sure you do nothing to quit scores with them  Cor  Nothing at all your honour unless now and then we happen to fling a cartridge into the kitchen  fire or put a spatterdash or so into the soupand sometimes Ned drums up and down stairs a little of a night  Lieu  Oh all that's fair but hark'ee lads I must have no grumbling on St Patrick's day so here take this and divide it amongst you But observe me now show

would die to defend  Enter  Doctor Rosy  Ah my little Doctor Rosy my galen abridge what's the news  Doc  All things are as they were my Alexander the Justice is as violent as ever I felt his pulse on the matter again and thinking his rage began to intermit I wanted to throw in the bark of good advice but it would not do He says you and your cutthroats have a plot upon his life and swears he had rather see his daughter in a scarlet fever than in the arms of a soldier  Lieu  Upon my word the army is very much obliged to him well then I must marry the girl first and ask his consent afterwards  Doc  So then the case of her fortune is desperate hey  Lieu  O hang fortune let that take its chance there is a beauty in Lauretta's simplicity so pure a bloom upon her charms  Doc  So there is so there isYou are for beauty as nature made her hey No artificial graces no cosmetic varnish no beauty in grain hey  Lieu  Upon my word Doctor you are right the London ladies were always too handsome for methen they are so defended such a circumvaluation of hoop with a breast work of whale bone that would turn a pistol bullet much less Cupid's arrows then turret on turret on top with stores of concealed weapons under pretence of black pins and above all a standard of feathers that would do honour to a knight of the Bath Upon my conscience I could as soon embrace an Amosen arm'd at all points  Doc  Right right my Alexandermy taste to a tittle  Lieu  Then Doctor though I admire modesty in women I like to see their faces I am for the changeable rose but with one of these quality amazons if their midnight dissipations had left them blood enough to raise a blush they have not room enough in their cheeks to show itTo be sure bashfulness is a very pretty thing but in my mind there is nothing on earth so impudent as an everlasting blush  Doc  My taste my tasteWell Lauretta is none of theseAh I never see her but she puts me in mind of my poor dear wife  Lieu  Ay faith in my opinion she can't do a worse thingNow is he going to bother me about an old hag that has been dead these six years  Aside  Doc  Oh poor Dolly I never shall see her like again such an arm for a bandageVeins that seem'd to invite the lancet Then her skin smooth and white as a gallipot her mouth as round and not larger than the month of a penny phial Her lips conserve of roses and then her teethnone of your sturdy fixturesask as they wou'dit was but a small pull and out they came I believe I have drawn half a score of her poor dear pearls  weeps  but what avails her beauty Death has no considerationone must die as well as another  Lieu  O if he begins to moralize  takes out his snuss box  Doc  Fair or ugly crooked or straight rich or poor flesh as grafs flowers fade  Lieu  Here Doctor take a pinch and keep up your spirits  Doc  True true my friend grief can't mend the matter all's for the best but such a woman was a great loss Lieutenant  Lieu  To be sure for doubtless she had mental accomplishments equal to her beauty  Doc  Mental accomplishments she would have stuffed an aligator or pickled a lizard with any Apothecary's wife in the kingdom Why she could decypher a prescription and invent the ingredients almost as well as myself then she was such a hand at making foreign waters for Setzer Pyrmont Islington or Chaly beate she never had her equaland her Bath and Bristol springs exceeded the originalsAh Poor Dolly she fell a martyr to her own discoveries  Lieu  How so pray  Doc  Poor soul her illness was occasioned by her zeal in trying an improvement on the Spa water by an infusion of rum and acid  Lieu  Ay ay spirits never agree with water drinkers  Doc  No no you mistakeRum agreed with her well enough it was not the rum that killed the poor dear creature for she died of a dropsy Well she is gone never to return and has left no pledge of our loves behindNo little babe to hang like a label round papa's neck well well we are all mortalsooner or later flesh is grassflowers fade  Lieu  O the devil again  Doc  Life's a shadow the world a stagewe strut an hour  Lieu  Here Doctor  Offers snuff  Doc  True true my friendwell high grief can't cure it All's for the best hey my little Alexander  Lieu  Right right an Apothecary should never be out of spirits But come faith 'tis time honest Humphrey should wait on the Justice that must be our first scheme  Doc  True true you should be ready the cloaths are at my house and I have given you such a character that he is impatient to have you he swears you shall be his body guard Well I honour the army or I should never do so much to serve you  Lieu  Indeed I am bound to you for ever Doctor and when once I'm possessed of my dear Lauretta I will endeavour to make work for you as fast as possible  Doc  Now you put me in mind of my poor wife again  Lieu  Ah pray forget her a little we shall be too late  Doc  Poor Dolly  Lieu  'Tis past twelve  Doc  Inhuman dropsy  Lieu  The Justice will wait
