 The BEAUTIES of GOLDSMITH or the Moral and Sentimental Treasury of Genius  The Volume of Nature is the Book of Knowledge and he becomes most wise who makes the most judicious selection  Citizen of the World  depiction of Oliver Goldsmith  LONDON  Printed for G Kearsley Fleet Street    Harmar Scrip  Price Half a Crown Sewed  TO THE EARL OF SHELBURNE  MY LORD  YOUR friendship for Dr  Goldsmith  is a sufficient inducement for me to inscribe his Beauties to you In all ages the illustrious and the learned have been courted in the highest strain of panegyric to take the offspring of Genius under their patronage This I am prevented from doing here for the writings from which this cento of excellence is taken have long since found innumerable admirers in every polished society My sole motive for addressing your Lordship  arises from your esteem for the Author whose moral and sentimental writings have given birth to a volume every way meriting your Lordship's countenance  I am MY LORD With the most perfect esteem Your LORDSHIP's most obedient and most devoted humble servant W H  London  April    PREFACE  IT is merely in compliance with custom I sit down to write a Preface Dr  Goldsmith  's writings need not an eulogium at this hour they may be compared to the invaluable paintings of  Raphael  the longer they are in the world their estimation becomes more extensive Time has drawn the veil of oblivion over the works of many writers once renowned if we may credit tradition for every perfection that captivates Nature was certainly wanting to enrich those compositions What she has had a hand in Time reverences and a final dissolution can only destroy How happy then must the hallowed spirit of  Goldsmith  be whose Beauties wear the simple brilliancy of Nature and all the decorative charms of Fancy whose praise is the theme of the ingenious from the  London  Capital of Taste and Patronage to the cottage of learned tranquillity and which Time will for ever regard with parental affection  The Pictures I have given from his Poems are the highest finished in the group and the whole selection will be found it is hoped meriting the attention and patronage of the refined lovers of elegant and estimable literature  W H  THE LIFE OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH  M B  FAME the only inflexible friend of Genius has been singularly kind to the Author whose life I with much pleasure sit down to give some account of She has sounded the praises of her favourite to the extremities of taste and literary refinement The Court and the Cottage share with equal felicity the invaluable fruits of his elegant studies The smallest memorial is a beacon for the incautious heart of virtue and simplicity or a balm for the wounded soul of the comfortless Hence the lovers of human excellence have been sedulous in establishing our writer's reputation on the basis of immortality  Goldsmith  's biographers have been many their opinions in some measure different but they all agree that he was a man of elevated genius unbounded philanthropy and possessing the milk of human kindness in a supereminent degree I have  their several accounts before me and upon an impartial survey Dr  Glover  's stands highest in my estimation He was  Goldsmith  's intimate friend a companion in many of his literary pursuits and his enthusiastic admirer What such a writer says as far as relates to facts must be listened to with more pleasure than a mere work of fiction however elaborate or splendidly set off It gives me pleasure to acknowledge the obligations I lie under to this ingenious and excellent companion for many particulars relative to Dr  Goldsmith  I shall give his account entire marked with double commas  "OLIVER GOLDSMITH  was born at  Roscommon  in  Ireland  in the year His father who possessed a small estate in that county had nine sons of which  Oliver  was the third He was originally intended for the church and with that view after being well instructed in the classics was with his brother the Rev  Henry Goldsmith  placed in  Trinity  college  Dublin  about the latter end of the year In this seminary of learning he continued a few years when he took a Bachelor's degree but his brother not being able to obtain any preferment after he left the college  Oliver  by the advice of Dean  Goldsmith  of  Cork  turned his thoughts to the profession of physic and after attending some courses of anatomy in  Dublin  proceeded to  Edinburgh  in the year where he studied the several branches of medicine  under the different Professors in that university which was deservedly ranked among the first schools of physic in  Europe  His beneficent disposition soon involved him in unexpected difficulties and he was obliged precipitately to leave  Scotland  in consequence of engaging himself to pay a considerable sum of money for a fellowstudent  "A few days after about the beginning of the year he arrived at  Sunderland  near  Newcastle  where he was arrested at the suit of one  Barclay  a taylor in  Edinburgh  to whom he had given security for his friend By the good graces of  Laughlin Maclane  Esq  and Dr  Sleigh  who were then in the college he was soon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff and took his passage on board a  Dutch  ship to  Rotterdam  where after a short stay he proceeded to  Brussels  He then visited great part of  Flanders  and after passing some time at  Strasbourg  and  Lovain  where he obtained a degree of Bachelor in Physic he accompanied an  English  gentleman to  Geneva  "It is undoubtedly fact that this ingenious unfortunate man made most part of his tour on foot He had left  England  with very little money and being of a philosophical turn and at that time possessing a body capable of sustaining every fatigue and a heart not easily terrified at danger he became an enthusiast to the design he had formed of seeing the manners of different countries He  had some knowledge of the  French  language and of music he played tolerably well on the  German  flute which from an amusement became at some times the means of subsistence His learning produced him an hospitable reception at most of the religious houses and his music made him welcome to the peasants of  Flanders  and  Germany  'Whenever I approached a peasant's house towards nightfall' he used to say 'I played one of my most merry tunes and that generally procured me not only a lodging but subsistence for the next day but in truth' his constant expression 'I must own whenever I attempted to entertain persons of a higher rank they always thought my performance odious and never made me any return for my endeavours to please them"  "On his arrival at  Geneva  he was recommended as a proper person for a travelling tutor to a young man who had been unexpectedly left a considerable sum of money by his uncle Mr  S  This youth who was articled to an attorney on receipt of his fortune determined to see the world and on his engaging with his preceptor made a proviso that he should be permitted to govern himself and our traveller soon found his pupil understood the art of directing in money concerns extremely well as avarice was his prevailing passion  "During  Goldsmith  's continuance in  Switzerland  he assiduously cultivated his poetical talent of which he had given some striking proofs at the college of  Edinburgh  It was from hence he sent the first sketch of his delightful epistle called  The Traveller  to his brother the clergyman in  Ireland  who giving up fame and fortune had retired with an amiable wife to happiness and obscurity on an income of only l a year  "From  Geneva  Mr  Goldsmith  and his pupil visited the South of  France  where the young man upon some disagreement with his preceptor paid him the small part of his salary which was due and embarked at  Marseilles  for  England  Our wanderer was left once more upon the world at large and passed through a number of difficulties in traversing the greatest part of  France  At length his curiosity being gratified he bent his course towards  England  and arrived at  Dover  the beginning of the winter in the year  "His finances were so low on his return to  England  that he with difficulty got to this metropolis his whole stock of cash amounting to no more than a few halfpence An entire stranger in  London  his mind was filled with the most gloomy reflections in consequence of his embarrassed situation He applied to several apothecaries in hopes of being received in the capacity of a journeyman but his broad  Irish  accent and the uncouthness of his appearance  occasioned him to meet with insult from most of the medicinal tribe The next day however a chymist near  Fishstreet  struck with his forlorn condition and the simplicity of his manner took him into his laboratory where he continued till he discovered his old friend Dr  Sleigh  was in  London  This gentleman received him with the warmest affection and liberally invited him to share his purse till some establishment could be procured for him  Goldsmith  unwilling to be a burden to his friend a short time after eagerly embraced an offer which was made him to assist the late Rev Dr  Milner  in instructing the young gentlemen at the academy at  Peckham  and acquitted himself greatly to the Doctor's satisfaction for a short time but having obtained some reputation by the criticisms he had written in the  Monthly Review  Mr  Griffiths  the principal proprietor engaged him in the compilation of it and resolving to pursue the profession of writing he returned to  London  as the mart where abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward Here he determined to adopt a plan of the strictest oeconomy and took lodgings in  GreenArbourcourt  in the  OldBailey  where he wrote several ingenious pieces The late Mr  Newbery  who at that time gave great encouragement to men of literary abilities became a kind of patron to our young author and introduced him as one of the writers in the  Public Ledger  in which his  Citizen of the World  originally appeared under the title of  'Chinese Letters'  "Fortune  now seemed to take some notice of a man she had long neglected The simplicity of his character the integrity of his heart and the merit of his productions made his company very acceptable to a number of respectable persons and he emerged from his shabby apartments near the  OldBailey  to the politer air of the  Temple  where he took handsome chambers and lived in a genteel style The publication of his  Traveller  his  Vicar of Wakefield  and his  Letters on the History of England  was followed by the performance of his comedy of  The Goodnatured Man  at  Coventgarden  theatre and placed him in the first rank of the poets of the present age  "Our Doctor as he was now universally called had a constant levee of his distressed countrymen whose wants as far as he was able he always relieved and he has been often known to leave himself even without a guinea in order to supply the necessities of others  "Another feature in his character we cannot help laying before the reader Previous to the publication of his  Deserted Village  the bookseller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy which the Doctor mentioned a few hours after to one of his friends who observed it was a very great sum for so short a performance 'In truth' replied  Goldsmith  'I think so too it is much more than the honest man can afford or  the piece is worth I have not been easy since I received it therefore I will go back and return him his note' which he absolutely did and left it entirely to the bookseller to pay him according to the profits produced by the sale of the poem which turned out very considerable  "During the last rehearsal of his comedy intitled  She Stoops to Conquer  which Mr  Colman  had no opinion would succeed on the Doctor's objecting to the repetition of one of  Tony Lumpkin  's speeches being apprehensive it might injure the play the manager with great keenness replied 'Psha my dear Doctor do not be fearful of  squibs  when we have been sitting almost these two hours upon a  barrel of gunpowder'  The piece however contrary to Mr  Colman  's expectation was received with uncommon applause by the audience and  Goldsmith  's pride was so hurt by the severity of the above observation that it entirely put an end to his friendship for the gentleman who made it  "Notwithstanding the great success of his pieces by some of which it is asserted upon good authority he cleared l in one year his circumstances were by no means in a prosperous situation partly owing to the liberality of his disposition and partly to an unfortunate habit he had contracted of gaming the arts of which he knew very little of and consequently became the prey of  those who were unprincipled enough to take advantage of his ignorance  "Just before his death he had formed a design for executing an  Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences  the prospectus of which he actually printed and distributed among his acquaintance In this work several of his literary friends particularly Sir  Joshua Reynolds  Dr  Johnson  Mr  Beauclerc  and Mr  Garrick  had engaged to furnish him with articles upon different subjects He had entertained the most sanguine expectations from the success of it The undertaking however did not meet with that encouragement from the booksellers which he had imagined it would undoubtedly receive and he used to lament this circumstance almost to the last hour of his existence  "He had been for some years afflicted at different times with a violent strangury which contributed not a little to imbitter the latter part of his life and which united with the vexations he suffered upon other occasions brought on a kind of habitual despondency In this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever which being improperly treated terminated in his dissolution on the th day of  April  in the fortythird year of his age His friends who were very numerous and respectable had determined to bury him in  WestminsterAbbey  where a tablet was to  have been erected to his memory His pall was to have been supported by Lord  Shelburne  Lord  Louth  Sir  Joshua Reynolds  the Hon Mr  Beauclerc  Mr  Edmund Burke  and Mr  Garrick  but from some unaccountable circumstances this design was dropped and his remains were privately deposited in the  Temple  burialground  As there is no vestige for strangers to distinguish the place of his interment a number of his admirers have long wished for a subscription to be opened towards erecting a tomb or headstone at his grave The Publisher of this Volume anxious for this tribute to Genius and Friendship will receive subscriptions from any of Dr  Goldsmith  's friends who may be inclined to patronise this undertaking    "As to his character it is strongly illustrated by Mr  Pope  's line  'In wit a man simplicity a child'  "The learned leisure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by distresses which arose from the openness of his temper and which sometimes threw him into loud fits of passion but this impetuosity was corrected upon a moment's reflection and his servants have been known upon these occasions purposely to throw themselves in his way that they might profit by it immediately after for he who had the good fortune to be reproved was certain of being rewarded for it His disappointments at other times made him peevish and fullen and he has often left a party of convivial  friends abruptly in the evening in order to go home and brood over his misfortunes a circumstance which contributed not a little to the increase of his malady  "The universal esteem in which his poems are held and the repeated pleasure they give in the perusal is a striking test of their merit He was a studious and correct observer of nature happy in the selection of his images in the choice of his subjects and in the harmony of his versification and though his embarrassed situation prevented him from putting the last hand to many of his productions his  Hermit  his  Traveller  and his  Deserted Village  bid fair to claim a place among the most finished pieces in the  English  language  "The writer of these anecdotes cannot conclude without declaring that as different accounts have been given of this ingenious man these are all founded upon facts and collected by one who lived with him upon the most friendly footing for a great number of years and who never felt any sorrow more sensibly than that which was occasioned by his death"  Let it be turned to what theme it will the opinion of an elevated literary character will succeed best with the million Let us hear what Dr  Johnson  says of our author in his Life of  Parnell  "THE Life of Dr  Parnell  is a task which I should very willingly decline since it has been lately written by  Goldsmith  a man of such variety of powers and such felicity of performance that he always seemed to do best that which he was doing a man who had the art of being minute without tediousness and general without confusion whose language was copious without exuberance exact without constraint and easy without weakness  "What such an author has told who would tell again I have made an abstract from his larger narrative and shall have this gratification from my attempt that it gives me an opportunity of paying due tribute to the memory of a departed genius"  The most interesting part of the account which Mr  Davies  has given of our author in his Life of  Garrick  deserves the reader's attention The latter part of it exhibits to mankind feelings of the first quality in nature  EVERY thing of  Goldsmith  seems to bear the magical touch of an enchanter no man took less pains and yet produced so powerful an effect the great beauty of his composition consists in a clear copious and expressive style  Goldsmith  was so sincere a man that he could not conceal what was uppermost in his mind so far from desiring to appear in the eye of the world to the best advantage he took more pains to be esteemed worse than he was than others do to appear better than they are  His disposition of mind was tender and compassionate no unhappy person ever sued to him for relief without obtaining it if he had any thing to give and rather than not relieve the distressed he would borrow The poor woman with whom he had lodged during his obscurity several years in  GreenArbour Court  by his death lost an excellent friend for the Doctor often supplied her with food from his table and visited her frequently with the sole purpose to be kind to her He had his dislike as most men have to particular people but unmixed with rancour He least of all mankind approved  Baretti  's conversation he considered him as an insolent overbearing foreigner as  Baretti  in his turn thought him an unpolished man and an absurd companion but when this unhappy  Italian  was charged with murder and afterwards sent by Sir  John Fielding  to  Newgate Goldsmith  opened his purse and would have given him every shilling it contained he at the same time insisted upon going in the coach with him to the place of his confinement"  A handsome Monument was erected to his Memory some time since in  WestminsterAbbey  in the Poets' Corner between  Gay  's and the Duke of  Argyle  's with the following Inscription supposed to be written by Dr  Johnson  OLIVARII GOLDSMITH  Poëtae Physici Historici  Qui nullum fere scribendi genus  non tetigit  nullum

MDCCLXXIV  The Editor of this work will be obliged to his ingenious readers for an elegant Translation of this Epitaph  Among a variety of other pieces to this excellent writer's memory the following are the most distinguished for poetical merit  EPITAPH ON DR  GOLDSMITH By  W WOTY  ADIEU sweet Bard to each fine feeling true  Thy virtues many and thy foibles few  Those form'd to charm e'en vicious mindsand These  With harmless mirth the social soul to please  Another's woe thy heart could always melt  None gave more freefor none more deeply felt  Sweet Bard adieu thy own harmonious lays  Have sculptur'd out thy monument of praise  YesThese survive to Time's remotest day  While drops the bust and boastful tombs decay  Reader if number'd in the Muses' train  Go tune the lyre and imitate his strain  But if no Poet thou reverse the plan  Depart in peace and imitate the Man  EXTRACT FROM  THE TEARS OF GENIUS  Occasioned by the Death of Dr  Goldsmith By  J S PRATT  THE villagebell tolls out the note of Death  And through the echoing air the length'ning sound  With dreadful pause reverberating deep  Spreads the sad tidings o'er fair  Auburn  's vale  There to enjoy the scenes her bard had prais'd  In all the sweet simplicity of song  Genius  in pilgrim garb sequester'd sat  And herded jocund with the harmless swains  But when she heard the fateforeboding knell  With startled step precipitate and swift  And look pathetic full of dire presage  The churchway walk beside the neighb'ring green  Sorrowing she sought and there in black array  Borne on the shoulders of the swains he lov'd  She saw the boast of  Auburn  mov'd along  Touch'd at the view her pensive breast she struck  And to the cypress which incumbent hangs  With leaning slope and branch irregular  O'er the moss'd pillars of the sacred fane  Th' briarbound graves shad'wing with fun'ral gloom  Forlorn she hied and there the crouding woe  Swell'd by the parent press'd on bleeding thought  Big ran the drops from her maternal eye  Fast broke the bosomsorrow from her heart  And pale  Distress  sat sickly on her cheek  As thus her plaintive elegy began  'And must my children all expire  Shall none be left to strike the lyre  Courts  Death  alone a learned prize  Falls his shafts only on the wise  Can no fit marks on earth be found  From useless thousands swarming round  What crouding cyphers cram the land  What hosts of victims at command  Yet shall th' ingenious drop alone  Shall  Science  grace the tyrant's throne  Thou murd'rer of the tuneful train  I charge thee with my children slain  Scarce has the Sun thrice urg'd his annual tour  Since half my race have felt thy barbarous power  Sore hast thou thinn'd each pleasing art  And struck a Muse with every dart  Bard after Bard obey'd thy slaughtering call  'Till scarce a Poet lives to sing a brother's fall  Then let a widow'd mother pay  The tribute of a parting lay  Tearful inscribe the monumental strain  And speak aloud her feelings and her pain  And first farewell to thee my son' she cried  'Thou pride of  Auburn  's dalesweet bard farewell  Long for thy sake the peasants tears shall flow  And many a virginbosom heave with woe  For thee shall Sorrow sadden all the scene  And every pastime perish on the green  The sturdy Farmer shall suspend his tale  The Woodman's ballad shall no more regale  No more shall mirth each rustic sport inspire  But every frolic every feat shall tire  No more the ev'ning gambol shall delight  Nor moonshine revels crown the vacant night  But groupes of Villagers each joy forgot  Shall form a sad assembly round the cot  Sweet Bard farewelland farewell  Auburn  's bliss  The bashful lover and the yielded kiss  The evening warble  Philomela  made  The echoing forest and the whispering shade  The winding brook the bleat of brute content  And the blithe voice that "whistled as it went"  These shall no longer charm the Plowman's care  But sighs shall fill the pauses of despair  Goldsmith  adieu the "booklearn'd Priest" for thee  Shall now in vain possess his festive glee  The oftheard jest in vain he shall reveal  For now alas the jest he cannot feel  But ruddy Damsels o'er thy tomb shall bend  And conscious weep for their and Virtue's friend  The Milkmaid shall reject the Shepherd's song  And cease to carol as she toils along  All  Auburn  shall bewail the fatal day  When from their fields their pride was snatch'd away  And even the Matron of the cressy lake  In piteous plight her palsied head shall shake  While all adown the furrows of her face  Slow shall the lingering tears each other trace  And oh my child severer woes remain  To all the houseless and unshelter'd train  Thy fate shall sadden many an humble guest  And heap fresh anguish on the beggar's breast  For dear wert thou to all the sons of pain  To all that wander sorrow or complain  Dear to the learned to the simple dear  For daily blessings mark'd thy virtuous year  The rich receiv'd a moral from thy head  And from thy heart the stranger found a bed  Distress came always smiling from thy door  For GOD had made thee agent to the poor  Had form'd thy feelings on the noblest plan  To grace at once the Poet

descended from one of the best families in the kingdom and was left a large fortune upon her sister's decease She had early in life been introduced into the best company and contracted a passion for elegance and expence It is usual to make the heroine of a story very witty and very beautiful and such circumstances are so surely expected that they are scarce attended to But whatever the finest poet could conceive of wit or the most celebrated painter imagine of beauty were excelled in the perfections of this young lady Her superiority in both was allowed by all who either heard or had seen her She was naturally gay generous to a fault goodnatured to the highest degree affable in conversation and some of her letters and other writings as well in verse as prose would have shone amongst those of the most celebrated wits of this or any other age had they been published  But these great qualifications were marked by another which lessened the value of them all She was imprudent But let it not be imagined that her reputation or honour suffered by her imprudence I only mean she had no knowledge of the use of money she relieved distress by putting herself into the circumstances of the object whose wants she supplied  She was arrived at the age of nineteen when the croud of her lovers and the continual repetition of new flattery had taught her to think she could never be forsaken and never poor Young ladies are apt to expect a certainty of success from a number of lovers and yet I have seldom seen a girl courted by an hundred lovers that found an husband in any Before the choice is fixed she has either lost her reputation or her good sense and the loss of either is sufficient to consign her to perpetual virginity  Among the number of this young lady's lovers was the celebrated  S  who at that time went by the name of  the goodnatured man  This gentleman with talents that might have done honour to humanity suffered himself to fall at length into the lowest state of debasement He followed the dictates of every newest passion his love his pity his generosity and even his friendships were all in excess he was unable to make head against any of his sensations or desires but they were in  general worthy wishes and desires for he was constitutionally virtuous This gentleman who at last died in a gaol was at that time this lady's envied favourite  It is probable that he thoughtless creature had no other prospect from this amour but that of passing the present moments agreeably He only courted dissipation but the lady's thoughts were fixed on happiness At length however his debts amounting to a considerable sum he was arrested and thrown into prison He endeavoured at first to conceal his situation from his beautiful mistress but she soon came to a knowledge of his distress and took a fatal resolution of freeing him from confinement by discharging all the demands of his creditors  Mr  Nash  was at that time in  London  and represented to the thoughtless young lady that such a measure would effectually ruin both that so warm a concern for the interests of Mr  S  would in the first place quite impair her fortune in the eyes of our sex and what was worse lessen her reputation in those of her own He added that thus bringing Mr  S  from prison would be only a temporary relief that a mind so generous as his would become bankrupt under the load of gratitude and instead of improving in friendship or affection he would only study to avoid a  Then Master of the Ceremonies at Bath  creditor he could never repay that though small favours produce goodwill great ones destroy friendship These admonitions however were disregarded and she too late found the prudence and truth of her adviser In short her fortune was by this means exhausted and with all her attractions she found her acquaintance began to disesteem her in proportion as she became poor  In this situation she accepted Mr  Nash  's invitation of returning to  Bath  He promised to introduce her to the best company there and he was assured that her merit would do the rest Upon her very first appearance ladies of the highest distinction courted her friendship and esteem but a settled melancholy had taken possession of her mind and no amusements that they could propose were sufficient to divert it Yet still as if from habit she followed the crowd in its levities and frequented those places where all persons endeavour to forget themselves in the bustle of ceremony and show  Her beauty her simplicity and her unguarded situation soon drew the attention of a designing wretch who at that time kept one of the Rooms at  Bath  and who thought that this lady's merit properly managed might turn to good account This woman's name was Dame  Lindsey  a creature who though vicious was in appearance sanctified and though designing had some wit and humour She began by the humblest assiduity to ingratiate  herself with Miss  S  shewed that she could be amusing as a companion and by frequent offers of money proved that she could be useful as a friend Thus by degrees she gained an entire ascendant over this poor thoughtless deserted girl and in less than one year namely about Miss  S  without ever transgressing the laws of virtue had entirely lost her reputation Whenever a person was wanting to make up a party for play at Dame  Lindsey  's  Sylvia  as she was then familiarly called was sent for and was obliged to suffer all those slights which the rich but too often let fall upon their inferiors in point of fortune  In most even the greatest minds the heart at last becomes level with the meanness of its condition but in this charming girl it struggled hard with adversity and yielded to every encroachment of contempt with sullen reluctance  But though in the course of three years she was in the very eye of public inspection yet Mr  Wood  the architect avers that he could never by the strictest observations perceive her to be tainted with any other vice than that of suffering herself to be decoyed to the gamingtable and at her own hazard playing for the amusement and advantage of others Her friend Mr  Nash  therefore thought proper to induce her to break off all connections with Dame  Lindsey  and to rent part of Mr  Wood  's house in  Queensquare  where she  behaved with the utmost complaisance regularity and virtue  In this situation her detestation of life still continued she found that time would infallibly deprive her of part of her attractions and that continual solicitude would impair the rest With these reflections she would frequently entertain herself and an old faithful maid in the vales of  Bath  whenever the weather would permit them to walk out She would even sometimes start questions in company with seeming unconcern in order to know what act of suicide was easiest and which was attended with the smallest pain When tired with exercise she generally retired to meditation and she became habituated to early hours of sleep and rest But when the weather prevented her usual exercise and her sleep was thus more difficult she made it a rule to rise from her bed and walk about her chamber till she began to find an inclination for repose  This custom made it necessary for her to order a burning candle to be kept all night in her room and the maid usually when she withdrew locked the chamberdoor and pushing the key under it beyond reach her mistress by that constant method lay undisturbed till seven o'clock in the morning then she arose unlocked the door and rang the bell as a signal for the maid to return  This state of seeming piety regularity and prudence continued for some time till the gay celebrated toasted Miss  Sylvia  was sunk into an housekeeper to the gentleman at whose house she lived She was unable to keep company for want of the elegancies of dress that are the usual passport among the polite and she was too haughty to seem to want them The fashionable the amusing and the polite in society now seldom visited her and from being once the object of every eye she was now deserted by all and preyed upon by the bitter reflections of her own imprudence  Mr  Wood  and part of his family were gone to  London  Miss  Sylvia  was left with the rest as a governess at  Bath  She sometimes saw Mr  Nash  and acknowledged the friendship of his admonitions though she refused to accept any other marks of his generosity than that of advice Upon the close of the day in which Mr  Wood  was expected to return from  London  she expressed some uneasiness at the disappointment of not seeing him took particular care to settle the affairs of his family and then as usual sat down to meditation She now cast a retrospect over her past misconduct and her approaching misery she saw that even affluence gave her no real happiness and from indigence she thought nothing could be hoped but lingering calamity She at length conceived the fatal resolution of leaving a life in which she could see no  corner for comfort and terminating a scene of imprudence in suicide  Thus resolved she sat down at her diningroom window and with cool intrepidity wrote the following elegant lines on one of the panes of the window  O Death thou pleasing end of human woe  Thou cure for life Thou greatest good below  Still may'st thou fly the coward and the slave  And thy soft slumbers only bless the brave  She then went into company with the most chearful serenity talked of indifferent subjects till supper which she ordered to be got ready in a little library belonging to the family There she spent the remaining hours preceding bedtime in dandling two of Mr  Wood  's children on her knees In retiring from thence to her chamber she went into the nursery to take her leave of another child as it lay sleeping in the cradle Struck with the innocence of the little babe's looks and the consciousness of her meditated guilt she could not avoid bursting into tears and hugging it in her arms she then bid her old servant a good night for the first time she had ever done so and went to bed as usual  It is probable she soon quitted her bed and was seized with an alternation of passions before  she yielded to the impulse of despair She dressed herself in clean linen and white garments of every kind like a bridemaid Her gown was pinned over her breast just as a nurse pins the swaddlingclothes of an infant A pink silk girdle was the instrument with which she resolved to terminate her misery and this was lengthened by another made of gold thread The end of the former was tied with a noose and the latter with three knots at a small distance from one another  Thus prepared she sat down again and read for she left the book open at that place in the story of  Olympia  in the  Orlando Furioso  of  Ariosto  where by the perfidy and ingratitude of her bosom friend she was ruined and left to the mercy of an unpitying world This tragical event gave her fresh spirits to go through her fatal purpose so standing upon a stool and flinging the girdle which was tied round her neck over a closetdoor that opened into her chamber she remained suspended Her weight however broke the girdle and the poor despairer fell upon the floor with such violence that her fall awakened a workman that lay in the house about half an hour after two o'clock  Recovering herself she began to walk about the room as her usual custom was when she wanted sleep and the workman imagining it to be only some ordinary accident again went to  sleep She once more therefore had recourse to a stronger girdle made of silver thread and this kept her suspended till she died  Her old maid continued in the morning to wait as usual for the ringing of the bell and protracted her patience hour after hour till two o'clock in the afternoon when the workmen at length entering the room through the window found their unfortunate mistress still hanging and quite cold The coroner's jury being impanelled brought in their verdict Lunacy and her corpse was next night decently buried in her father's grave at the charge of a female companion with whom she had for many years an inseparable intimacy  Thus ended a female wit a toast and a gamester loved admired and forsaken formed for the delight of society fallen by imprudence into an object of pity Hundreds in high life lamented her fate and wished when too late to redress her injuries They who once had helped to impair her fortune now regretted that they assisted in so mean a pursuit The little effects she had left behind were bought up with the greatest avidity by those who desired to preserve some token of a companion that once had given them such delight The remembrance of every virtue she was possessed of was now improved by pity Her former follies were few but the last swelled them to a large amount As she remains the  strongest instance to posterity that want of prudence alone almost cancels every other virtue  LIFE OF NASH p  CALAMITIES  MAN little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to bear till he tries them As in ascending the heights of ambition which look bright from below every step we rise shews us some new and gloomy prospect of hidden disappointment so in our descent from the summits of pleasure though the vale of misery below may appear at first dark and gloomy yet the busy mind still attentive to its own amusement finds as we descend something to flatter and to please Still as we approach the darkest objects appear to brighten and the mental eye becomes adapted to its gloomy situation  VICAR OF WAKEFIELD v p  BOOKS  BOOKS while they teach us to respect the interests of others often make us unmindful of our own while they instruct the youthful reader to grasp at social happiness he grows miserable in detail and attentive to universal harmony often forgets that he himself has a part to sustain in the  concert I dislike therefore the philosopher who describes the inconveniencies of life in such pleasing colours that the pupil grows enamoured of distress longs to try the charms of poverty meets it without dread nor fears its inconveniencies till he severely

volume of nature is the book of knowledge and he becomes most wise who makes the most judicious selection  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  OPINION OF THE ENGLISH  THE English in general seem fonder of gaining the esteem than the love of those they converse with this gives a formality to their amusements their gayest conversations have something too wise for innocent relaxation though in company you are seldom disgusted with the absurdity of a fool you are seldom lifted into rapture by those strokes of vivacity which give instant though not permanent pleasure  What they want however in gaiety they make up in politeness You smile at hearing me praise the English for their politeness you who have heard very different accounts from the missionaries at Pekin who have seen such a different behaviour in their merchants and seamen at home But I must still repeat it the English seem more polite than any of their neighbours their great art in this respect lies in endeavouring while they oblige to lessen the force of the favour Other countries are fond of obliging a stranger but seem desirous that he should be sensible of the obligation The English confer their kindness with an appearance  of indifference and give away benefits with an air as if they despised them  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  REPUTATION  AS the reputation of books is raised not by their freedom from defect but the greatness of

proportion to the value of the benefit or the frequency of its acceptance he gives up so much of his natural independance He therefore who thrives upon the unmerited bounty of another if he has any sensibility suffers the worst of servitude the shackled slave may murmur without reproach but the humble dependant is taxed with ingratitude upon every symptom of discontent the one may rave round the walls of his cell but the other  lingers in all the silence of mental confinement To increase his distress every new obligation but adds to the former load which kept the vigorous mind from rising till at last elastic no longer it shapes itself to constraint and puts on habitual servility  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  VICE  WE are not to be surprised that bad men want shame they only blush at being detected in doing good but glory in their vices  VIC OF WAKEFIELD v p  MALICE  TO be at once merry and malicious is the sign of a corrupt heart and mean understanding  HIST OF ENGLAND v p  BENEFACTION  IN general the benefactions of a generous man are but ill bestowed His heart seldom gives him leave to examine the real distress of the object which sues for pity his goodnature takes the alarm too soon and he bestows his fortune only on apparent wretchedness The man naturally frugal on the other hand seldom relieves but when he does his reason and not his sensations generally find out the object Every instance of  his bounty is therefore permanent and bears witness to his benevolence  LIFE OF NASH p  COMMUNION WITH OUR OWN HEARTS  IF we could but learn to commune with our own hearts and know what noble company we can make them we would little regard the elegance and splendors of the worthless Almost all men have been taught to call life a passage and themselves the travellers The

exile  VIC OF WAKEFIELD v p  VASSALAGE  IT is perhaps one of the severest misfortunes of the great that they are in general obliged to live among men whose real value is lessened by dependance and whose minds are enslaved by obligation The humble companion may have at first accepted patronage with generous views but soon he feels the mortifying influence of conscious inferiority by degrees sinks into a flatterer and from flattery at last degenerates into stupid veneration To remedy this the great often dismiss their old dependants and take new Such changes are falsely imputed to levity falsehood  or caprice in the patron since they may be more justly ascribed to the client's gradual deterioration  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  ADVERSITY  THE greatest object in the universe says a certain

occasion is often wanting during a whole life for a great exertion but trifling opportunities of shining are almost every hour offered to the little sedulous mind and a person thus employed is not only more pleasing but more useful in a state of tranquil society  LIFE OF NASH p  EDWIN AND ANGELINA  'TURN gentle Hermit of the dale  'And guide my lonely way  'To where yon taper cheers the vale

virtue while the means of appearing considerable are more easily acquired than the title to be considered The first impression we generally make arises from our dress and this varies in conformity to our inclinations and the manner in which we desire to be considered The modest man or he who would wish to be thought so desires to shew the simplicity of his mind by the plainness of his dress the vain man on the contrary takes a pleasure in displaying his superiority  "and is willing to incur the spectator's dislike so he does but excite his attention"  HIST OF ANIMALS p  JUSTICE  Of all virtues Justice is the most difficult to be practised by a king who has a power to pardon All men even tyrants themselves lean to mercy when unbiassed by passions or interest The heart naturally persuades to forgiveness and pursuing the dictates of this pleasing deceiver we are led to prefer our private satisfaction to public utility What a thorough love for the public what a strong command over the passions what a finely conducted judgment must he possess who opposes the dictates of reason to those of his heart and prefers the  future interest of his people to his own immediate satisfaction  If still to a man's own natural biass for tenderness we add the numerous solicitations made by a criminal's friends for mercy if we survey a king not only opposing his own feelings but reluctantly refusing those he regards and this to satisfy the public whose cries he may never hear whose gratitude he may never receive this surely is true greatness Let us fancy ourselves for a moment in this just old man's place surrounded by numbers all soliciting the same favour a favour that nature disposes us to grant where the inducements to pity are laid before us in the strongest light suppliants at our feet some ready to resent a refusal none opposing a compliance let us I say suppose ourselves in such a situation and I fancy we should find ourselves more apt to act the character of goodnatured men than of upright magistrates  What contributes to raise justice above all other kingly virtues is that it is attended seldom with a due share of applause and those who practise it must be influenced by greater motives than empty fame The people are generally well pleased with a remission of punishment and all that wears the appearance of humanity it is the wise alone who are capable of discerning that impartial justice is the truest mercy they know it to be difficult very  difficult at once to compassionate and yet condemn an object that pleads for tenderness  CIT OF THE WORLD p  VANITY  O VANITY thou constant deceiver how do all thy efforts to exalt serve but to sink us Thy false colourings like those employed to heighten beauty only seem to mend that bloom which they contribute to destroy  GOODNATURED MAN p  DIGNITY OF MAN  MANKIND have ever been prone to expatiate in the praise of human nature The dignity of man is a subject that has always been the favourite theme of humanity they have declaimed with that ostentation which usually accompanies such as are sure of having a partial audience they have obtained victories because there were none to oppose Yet from all I have ever read or seen men appear more apt to err by having too high than by having too despicable an opinion of their nature and by attempting to exalt their original place in the creation depress their real value in society  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  INGRATITUDE OF THE WORLD  THE ingratitude of the world can never deprive us of the conscious happiness of having acted with humanity ourselves  GOODNATURED MAN p  ABILITIES  IN learning the useful part of every profession very moderate abilities will suffice even if the mind be a little balanced with stupidity it may in this case be useful Great abilities have always been less serviceable to the possessors than moderate ones Life has been compared to a race but the allusion still improves by observing that the most swift are ever the least manageable  TO know one profession only is enough for one man to know and this whatever the professors may tell you to the contrary is soon learned Be

by extorted benevolence The man who can thank himself alone for the happiness he enjoys is truly blest and lovely far more lovely the sturdy gloom of laborious indigence than the fawning simper of thriving adulation  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  SONG  "WHEN lovely woman stoops to folly  "And finds too late that men betray  "What charm can soothe her melancholy  "What art can wash her guilt away  "The

of greatness their regards are dissipated on too great a number of objects to feel parental affection the ties of nature are only strong with those who have but few friends or few dependants  HIST OF ENG IN LET v p  GENEROSITY  GENEROSITY properly applied will supply every other external advantage in life but the love of those we converse with it will procure esteem and a conduct resembling real affection but actual love is the spontaneous production of the mind no generosity can purchase no rewards increase nor no liberality continue it the very person who is obliged has it not in his power to force his lingering affections upon the object he should love and voluntarily mix passion with gratitude  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  GRATITUDE  GRATITUDE is never conferred but where there have been previous endeavours to excite it we consider it as a debt and our spirits wear a load till we have discharged the obligation Every acknowledgment of gratitude is a circumstance of  humiliation and some are found to submit to frequent mortifications of this kind proclaiming what obligations they owe merely because they think it in some measure cancels the debt  IBID v p  LOVE AND GRATITUDE  LOVE is the most easy and agreeable and gratitude the most humiliating affection of the mind we never reflect on the man we  love  without exulting in our choice while he who has bound us to him by  benefits  alone rises to our idea as a person to whom we have in some measure forfeited our freedom Love and gratitude are seldom therefore found in the same breast without impair+ing each other we may tender the one or the other singly to those we converse with but cannot command both together By attempting to increase we diminish them the mind becomes bankrupt under too large obligations all additional benefits lessen every hope of future return and bar up every avenue that leads to tenderness  IBID v p  FAVOURS  IN all our connexions with society it is not only generous but prudent to appear insensible of the value of those favours we bestow and endeavour to make the obligation seem as slight as possible Love must be taken by stratagem and  not by open force We should seem ignorant that we oblige and leave the mind at full liberty to give or refuse its affections for constraint may indeed leave the receiver still grateful but it will certainly produce disgust  IBID v p  LIBERALITY  IMPARTED fortune and wellplaced liberality may procure the benefactor goodwill may load the person obliged with the sense of the duty he lies under to retaliate this is gratitude and simple gratitude untinctured with love is all the return an ingenuous mind can bestow for former benefits  IBID v p  GRATITUDE AND LOVE  GRATITUDE and love are almost opposite affections love is often an involuntary passion placed upon our companions without our consent and frequently conferred without our previous esteem We love some men we know not why our tenderness is naturally excited in all their concerns we excuse their faults with the same indulgence and approve their virtues with the same applause with which we consider our own While we entertain the passion it pleases us we cherish it with delight and give it up with reluctance and love for love is all the reward we expect or desire  IBID v p  REFLECTION ON THE EARTH  THE Earth gentle and indulgent ever subservient to the wants of man spreads his walks with flowers and his table with plenty returns with interest every good committed to her care and though she produces the poison she still supplies the antidote though constantly teized more to furnish the luxuries of man than his necessities yet even to the last she continues her kind indulgence and when life is over she piously covers his remains in her bosom  HIST OF THE EARTH p  REJOICING AT THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR ENEMIES  TO rejoice at the destruction of our enemies is a foible grafted upon human nature and we must be permitted to indulge it the true way of atoning for such an illfounded pleasure is thus to turn our triumph into an act of benevolence and to testify our own joy by endeavouring to banish anxiety from others  Hamti the best and wisest emperor that ever filled the throne after having gained three signal victories over the Tartars who had invaded his dominions returned to Nankin in order to enjoy the glory of his conquest After he had rested for some days the people who are naturally fond of  processions impatiently expected the triumphal entry which emperors upon such occasions were accustomed to make Their murmurs came to the emperor's ear He loved his people and was willing to do all in his power to satisfy their just de+sires He therefore assured them that he intended upon the next feast of the Lanterns to exhibit one of the most glorious triumphs that had ever been seen in China  The people were in raptures at his condescension and on the appointed day assembled at the gates of the palace with the most eager expectations Here they waited for some time without seeing any of those preparations which usually precede a pageant The lantern with ten thousand tapers was not yet brought forth the fireworks which usually covered the city walls were not yet lighted the people once more began to murmur at this delay when in the midst of their impatience the palace gates flew open and the emperor himself appeared not in splendor or magnificence but in an ordinary habit followed by the blind the maimed and the strangers of the city all in new clothes and each carrying in his hand money enough to supply his necessities for the year The people were at first amazed but soon perceived the wisdom of their king who taught them that to make one man happy was more truly great than having ten thousand captives groaning at the wheels of his chariot  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  THE COUNTRY CLERGYMAN  NEAR yonder copse where once the garden smil'd  And still where many a gardenflower grows wild  There where a few torn shrubs the place disclose  The VillagePreacher's modest mansion rose  A man he was to all the country dear  And passing rich with forty pounds a year  Remote from towns he ran his godly race  Nor e'er had chang'd nor wish'd to change his place  Unpractis'd he to fawn or seek for power  By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour  Far other aims his heart had learn'd to prize  More skill to raise the wretched than to rise  His house was known to all the vagrant train  He chid their wand'rings but reliev'd their pain  The longremember'd beggar was his guest  Whose beard descending swept his aged breast  The ruin'd spendthrift now ho longer proud  Claim'd kindred there and had his claim allow'd  The broken soldier kindly bad to stay  Sat by his fire and talk'd the night away  Wept o'er his wounds or tales of sorrow done  Shoulder'd his crutch and shew'd how fields were won  Pleas'd with his guests the good man learn'd to glow  And quite forgot their vices in their woe  Careless their merits or their faults to scan  His pity gave ere charity began  Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride  And even his failings lean'd to Virtue's side  But in his duty prompt at every call  He watch'd and wept he pray'd and felt for all  And as a bird each fond endearment tries  To tempt its newfledg'd offspring to the skies  He try'd each art reprov'd each dull delay  Allur'd to brighter worlds and led the way  Beside the bed where parting life was laid  And sorrow guilt and pain by turns dismay'd  The rev'rend champion stood At his control  Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul  Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise  And his last falt'ring accents whisper'd praise  At church with meek and unaffected grace  His looks adorn'd the venerable place  Truth from his lips prevail'd with double sway  And fools who came to scoff remain'd to pray  The service past around the pious man  With steady zeal each honest rustic ran  E'en children follow'd with endearing wile  And pluck'd his gown to share the good man's smile  His ready smile a Parent's warmth exprest  Their welfare pleas'd him and their cares distrest  To them his heart his love his griefs were given  But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven  As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form  Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm  Tho' round its breast the rolling clouds are spread  Eternal sunshine settles on its head  DESERTED VILLAGE p  YOUTH  IT has been often said that the season of youth is the season of pleasures but this can only be true in savage countries where but little preparation is made for the perfection of human nature and where the mind has but a very small part in the enjoyment It is otherwise in those places where nature is carried to the highest pitch of refinement in which this season of the greatest sensual delight is wisely made subservient to the succeeding and more rational one of manhood Youth with us is but a scene of preparation a drama upon the right conduct of which all future happiness is to depend The youth who follows his appetites too soon seizes the cup before it has received its best ingredients and by anticipating his pleasures robs the remaining parts of life of their share so that his eagerness only produces a manhood of imbecillity and an age of pain  HIST OF ANIMALS p  THE SOUL  WHEN the soul is at rest all the features of the visage seem settled in a state of profound tranquillity Their proportion their union and their harmony seem to mark the sweet serenity of the mind and give a true information of what passes within But when the soul is excited the  human visage becomes a living picture where the passions are expressed with as much delicacy as energy where every motion is designed by some correspondent feature where every impression anticipates the will and betrays those hidden agitations that he would often wish to conceal  It is particularly in the eyes that the passions are painted and in which we may most readily discover their beginning The eye seems to belong to the soul more than any other organ it seems to participate of all its emotions as well the most soft and tender as the most tumultuous and forceful It not only receives but transmits them by sympathy the observing eye of one catches the secret fire from another and the passion thus often becomes general  IBID p  NATURE  TO copy nature is a task the most bungling workman is able to execute to select such parts as contribute to delight is reserved only for those whom accident has blest

fame is acquired in solitude and the historian who only views him at a distance must be content with a dry detail of actions by which he is scarce distinguished from the rest of mankind But we are fond of talking of those who have given us pleasure not that we have any thing important to say but because the subject is pleasing  LIFE OF PARNELL p  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MONARCHICAL AND REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT  WE now are all agreed that unlimited power arrogated on one side and the tumultuous freedom introduced on the other are both intolerable yet of the two perhaps despotism is superior In a republic the number of tyrants are uncontroulable for they can support each other in oppression in a monarchy there is one object who if he offends is easily punishable because he is but one The oppressions of a monarch are generally exerted only in the narrow sphere round him the oppressions of the governors of a republic though not so flagrant are more universal the monarch is apt to commit great enormities but they seldom reach the multitude at humble distance from the throne the republican despot oppresses the multitude that lies within the circle of his influence  for he knows them the monarch terrifies me with great evils which I may never feel the despot actually loads me with submissions which I am constantly obliged to sustain and in my opinion it is much better to be in danger of having my head chopped off with an axe once in my life than to have my leg galled with a continual fetter  HIST OF ENG IN LET c v p  REFLECTION ON THE LIFE OF A POET  A POET while living is

IGNORANCE  ASSUMING IGNORANCE is of all dispositions the most ridiculous for in the same proportion as the real man of wisdom is preferable to the unletter'd rustic so much is the rustic superior to

distinctions between will and power they may be permitted to enjoy their systems at pleasure as they are harmless although they may be wrong but when they alledge that  children are to be every day plunged in cold water and whatever be their constitution indiscriminately inured to cold and moisture that they are to be kept wet in the feet to prevent their catching cold and never to be corrected when young for fear of breaking their spirits when old these are such noxious errors that all reasonable men should endeavour to oppose them Many have been the children whom these opinions begun in speculation have injured or destroyed in practice and I have seen many a little philosophical martyr whom I wished but was unable to relieve  HIST OF ANIMALS p  HOPE A SONG  THE wretch condemn'd with

alone but the elegant excesses of refinement are best corrected by the still voice of studious enquiry In a polite age almost every person becomes a reader and receives more instruction from the press than the pulpit The preaching Bonse may instruct the illiterate peasant but nothing less than the insinuating address of a fine writer can win its way to an heart already relaxed in all the effeminacy of refinement Books are necessary to correct the vices of the polite but those vices are ever changing and the antidote should be changed accordinglyshould still be new  Instead therefore of thinking the number of new publications too great I could wish it still greater as they are the most useful instruments of reformation Every country must be instructed either by  writers  or  preachers  but as the number of readers increases the number of hearers is proportionably diminishedthe writer becomes more useful and the preaching Bonse less necessary  Instead therefore of complaining that writers are overpaid when their works procure them a bare subsistance I should imagine it the duty of a state not only to encourage their numbers but their industry A Bonse is rewarded with immense riches for instructing only a few even of the most ignorant of the people and sure the poor scholar should not beg his bread who is capable of instructing a million  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  MODESTY  MODESTY seldom

since every person who travels in this great pursuit takes a separate road The different colours which suit different complexions are not more various than the different pleasures appropriated to

are destroyed in the contest or driven at a distance from his habitations The extensive and tempestuous ocean instead of limiting or dividing his power only serves to assist his industry and enlarge the sphere of his enjoyments Its billows and its monsters instead of presenting a scene of  terror only call up the courage of this little intrepid being and the greatest danger that man now fears on the deep is from his fellowcreatures Indeed when I consider the human race as Nature has formed them there is but very little of the habitable globe that seems made for them But when I consider them as accumulating the experience of ages in commanding the earth there is nothing so great or so terrible What a poor contemptible being is the naked savage standing on the beach of the ocean and trembling at its tumults How little capable is he of converting its terrors into benefits or of saying Behold an element made wholly for my enjoyment He considers it as an angry Deity and pays it the homage of submission But it is very different when he has exercised his mental powers when he has learned to find his own superiority and to make it subservient to his commands It is then that his dignity begins to appear and that the true Deity is justly praised for having been mindful of man for having given him the earth for his habitation and the sea for an inheritance  HIST OF THE EARTH p

sedate and resolute step announce the nobleness of his rank He touches the earth only with his extremity and beholds it as if at a disdainful distance His arms are not given him as to other creatures for pillars of support nor does he lose by rendering them callous against the ground that delicacy of touch which furnishes him with so many of his enjoyments His hands are made for very different

GOODNATURED MAN p  OPINION OF WOMEN WITH AN ACCOUNT OF CATHARINA ALEXOWNA EMPRESS OF RUSSIA  THE modest virgin the prudent wife or the careful matron are much more serviceable in life than petticoated philosophers blustering heroines or virago queens She who makes her husband and her children happy who reclaims the one from vice and trains up the other to virtue is a much greater character than ladies described in romance whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their quiver or their eyes  Women it has been observed are not naturally formed for great cares themselves but to soften ours Their tenderness is the proper reward for the dangers we undergo for their preservation and the ease and chearfulness of their conversation our desirable retreat from the fatigues of intense application They are confined within the narrow limits of domestic assiduity and when they stray beyond them they move beyond their sphere and consequently without grace  Fame therefore has been very unjustly dispensed among the female sex Those who least deserved to be remembered meet our admiration and applause while many who have been an honour to humanity are passed over in silence Perhaps no age has produced a stronger instance of misplaced fame than the present the  Semiramis  and the  Thalestris  of antiquity are talked of while a modern character infinitely greater than either is unnoticed and unknown  This account seems taken from the manuscript memoirs of  H Spelman  Esq  Catharina Alexowna  born near  Derpat  a little city in  Livonia  was heir to no other inheritance than the virtues and frugality other parents Her father being dead she lived with her aged mother in their cottage covered with straw and both though very poor were very contented Here retired  from the gaze of the world by the labour of her hands she supported her parent who was now incapable of supporting herself While  Catharina  spun the old woman would sit by and read some book of devotion thus when the fatigues of the day were over both would sit down contentedly by their fireside and enjoy the frugal meal with vacant festivity  Though her face and person were models of perfection yet her whole attention seemed bestowed upon her mind her mother taught her to read and an old  Lutheran  minister instructed her in the maxims and duties of religion Nature had furnished her not only with a ready but a solid turn of thought not only with a strong but a right understanding Such truly female accomplishments procured her several solicitations of marriage from the peasants of the country but their offers were refused for she loved her mother too tenderly to think of a separation  Catharina  was fifteen when her mother died she now therefore left her cottage and went to live with the  Lutheran  minister by whom she had been instructed from her childhood In his house she resided in quality of governess to his children at once reconciling in her character unerring prudence with surprising vivacity  The old man who regarded her as one of his own children had her instructed in dancing and  music by the masters who attended the rest of his family Thus she continued to improve till he died by which accident she was once more reduced to pristine poverty The country of  Livonia  was at this time wasted by war and lay in a most miserable state of desolation Those calamities are ever most heavy upon the poor wherefore  Catharina  though possessed of so many accomplishments experienced all the miseries of hopeless indigence Provisions becoming every day more scarce and her private stock being entirely exhausted she resolved at last to travel to  Marienburgh  a city of greater plenty  With her scanty wardrobe packed up in a wallet she set out on her journey on foot She was to walk through a region miserable by nature but rendered still more hideous by the  Swedes  and  Russians  who as each happened to become masters plundered it at discretion but hunger had taught her to despise the dangers and fatigues of the way  One evening upon her journey as she had entered a cottage by the wayside to take up her lodging for the night she was insulted by two  Swedish  soldiers who insisted upon qualifying her as they termed it  to fellow she camp  They might probably have carried their insults into violence had not a subaltern officer accidentally passing by come in to her assistance Upon his appearing the soldiers immediately desisted but her thankfulness  was hardly greater than her surprise when she instantly recollected in her deliverer the son of the  Lutheran  minister her former instructor benefactor and friend  This was an happy interview for  Catharina  The little stock of money she had brought from home was by this time quite exhausted her clothes were gone piece by piece in order to satisfy those who had entertained her in their houses her generous countryman therefore parted with what he could spare to buy her clothes furnished her with an horse and gave her letters of recommendation to Mr  Gluck  a faithful friend of his father's and Superintendant of  Marienburgh  Our beautiful stranger had only to appear to be well received she was immediately admitted into the Superintendant's family as governess to his two daughters and though yet but seventeen shewed herself capable of instructing her sex not only in virtue but politeness Such was her goodsense and beauty that her master himself in a short time offered her his hand which to his great surprise she thought proper to refuse Actuated by a principle of gratitude she was resolved to marry her deliverer only even though he had lost an arm and was otherwise disfigured by wounds in the service  In order therefore to prevent further solicitations from others as soon as the officer came to  town upon duty she offered him her person which he accepted with transport and their nuptials were solemnised as usual But all the lines of her fortune were to be striking the very day on which they were married the  Russians  laid siege to  Marienburgh  The unhappy soldier had now no time to enjoy the wellearned pleasures of matrimony he was called off before consummation to an attack from which he was never after seen to return  In the mean time the siege went on with fury aggravated on one side by obstinacy on the other by revenge This war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous the innocent peasant and the harmless virgin often shared the fate of the soldier in arms  Marienburgh  was taken by assault and such was the fury of the assailants that not only the garrison but almost all the inhabitants men women and children were put to the sword At length when the carnage was pretty well over  Catharina  was found hid in an oven  She had been hitherto poor but still was free she was now to conform to her hard fate and learn what it was to be a slave in this situation however she behaved with piety and humility and though misfortunes had abated her vivacity yet she was chearful The fame of her merit and resignation reached even Prince  Menzikoff  the  Russian  General he desired to see her was struck with her beauty bought her from the soldier her master  and placed her under the direction of his own sister Here she was treated with all the respect which her merit deserved while her beauty every day improved with her good fortune  She had not been long in this situation when  Peter the Great  paying the Prince a visit  Catharina  happened to come in with some dry fruits which she served round with peculiar modesty The mighty monarch saw and was struck with her beauty He returned the next day called for the beautiful slave asked her several questions and found her understanding even more perfect than her person  He had been forced when young to marry from motives of interest he was now resolved to marry pursuant to his own inclinations He immediately enquired the history of the fair  Livonian  who was not yet eighteen He traced her through the vale of obscurity through all the vicissitudes of her fortune and found her truly great in them all The meanness of her birth was no obstruction to his design their nuptials were solemnised in private the Prince assuring his courtiers that virtue alone was the properest ladder to a throne  We now see  Catharina  from the low mudwalled cottage Empress of the greatest kingdom upon earth The poor solitary wanderer is now surrounded by thousands who find happiness in her smile She who formerly wanted a meal is  now capable of diffusing plenty upon whole nations To her fortune she owed a part of this preeminence but to her virtues more  She ever after retained those great qualities which first placed her on a throne and while the extraordinary prince her husband laboured for the reformation of his male subjects she studied in her turn the improvement of her own sex She altered their dresses introduced mixed assemblies instituted an order of female knighthood and at length when she had greatly filled all the stations of empress friend wife and mother bravely died without regretregretted by all  CIT OF THE

The love he bore to learning was in fault  The village all declar'd how much he knew  'Twas certain he could write and cypher too  Lands he could measure terms and tides presage  And even the story

VILLAGE p  DEPENDANCE  AMONG the many who have enforced the duty of giving I am surprised there are none to inculcate the ignominy of receiving to shew that by every favour we accept we in some

GOODNATURED MAN p  THE MAN OF THE WORLD A TALE  IF you are fond of hearing  hairbreadth 'scapes  my history must certainly please for I have been for twenty years upon the very verge of starving without ever being starved  My father the younger son of a good family was possessed of a small living in the church His education was above his fortune and his generosity greater than his education Poor as he was he had his flatterers still poorer than himself for every dinner he gave them they returned him an equivalent in praise and this was all he wanted The same ambition that actuates a monarch at the head of an army influenced my father at the head of his table he told the story of the ivytree and that was laughed at he repeated the jest of the two scholars and one pair of breeches and the company laughed at that but the story of Taffy in the sedan chair was sure to set the table in a roar Thus his pleasure increased in proportion to the pleasure he gave he loved all the world and he fancied all the world loved him  As his fortune was but small he lived up to the very extent of it he had no intentions of leaving his children money for that was dross he was resolved they should have learning for  learning he used to observe was better than silver or gold For this purpose he undertook to instruct us himself and took as much pains to form our morals as to improve our understanding We were told that universal benevolence was what first cemented society we were taught to consider all the wants of mankind as our own to regard the  human face divine  with affection and esteem he wound us up to be mere machines of pity and rendered us incapable of withstanding the slightest impulse made either by real or fictitious distress in a word we were perfectly instructed in the art of  giving away  thousands before we were taught the more necessary qualifications of  getting  a farthing  I cannot avoid imagining that thus refined by his lessons out of all my suspicion and divested of even all the little cunning which nature had given me I resembled upon my first entrance into the busy and insidious world one of those gladiators who were exposed without armour in the amphitheatre at Rome My father however who had only seen the world on one side seemed to triumph in my superior discernment though my whole stock of wisdom consisted in being able to talk like himself upon subjects that once were useful because they were then topics of the busy world but that now were utterly useless because connected with the busy world no longer  The first opportunity he had of finding his expectations disappointed was at the very middling figure I made in the University he had flattered himself that he should soon see me rising into the foremost rank in literary reputation but was mortified to find me utterly unnoticed and unknown His disappointment might have been partly ascribed to his having overrated my talents and partly to my dislike of mathematical reasonings at a time when my imagination and memory yet unsatisfied were more eager after new objects than desirous of reasoning upon those I knew This did not however please my tutors who observed indeed that I was a little dull but at the same time allowed that I seemed to be  very goodnatured  and had no harm in me  After I had resided at college seven years my father died and left mehis blessing Thus shoved from shore without illnature to protect or cunning to guide or proper stores to subsist me in so dangerous a voyage I was obliged to embark in the wide world at twentytwo But in order to settle in life my friends  advised  for they always advise when they begin to despise us they advised me I say to go into orders  To be obliged to wear a long wig when I liked a short one or a black coat when I generally dressed in brown I thought was such a restraint upon my liberty that I absolutely rejected the  proposal A priest in England is not the same mortified creature with a bonze in China with us not he that fasts best but eats best is reckoned the best liver yet I rejected a life of luxury indolence and ease from no other consideration but that boyish one of dress so that my friends were now perfectly satisfied I was undone and yet they thought it a pity for one who had not the least harm in him and was so very goodnatured  Poverty naturally begets dependance and I was admitted as flatterer to a great man At first I was surprised that the situation of a flatterer at a great man's table could be thought disagreeable there was no great trouble in listening attentively when his lordship spoke and laughing when he looked round for applause This even goodmanners might have obliged me to perform I found however too soon that his lordship was a greater dunce than myself and from that very moment my power of flattery was at an end I now rather aimed at setting him right than at receiving his absurdities with submission To flatter those we do not know is an easy task but to flatter our intimate acquaintances all whose foibles are strongly in our eye is drudgery insupportable Every time I now opened my lips in praise my falshood went to my conscience his lordship soon per+ceived me to be unfit for service I was therefore discharged my patron at the same time being  graciously pleased to observe that he believed I was tolerably goodnatured and had not the least harm in me  Disappointed in ambition I had recourse to love A young lady who lived with her aunt and was possessed of a pretty fortune in her own disposal had given me as I fancied some reasons to expect success The symptoms by which I was guided were striking she had always laughed with me at her aukward acquaintance and at her aunt among the number she always observed that a man of sense would make a better husband than a fool and I as constantly applied the observation in my own favour She continually talked in my company of friendship and the beauties of the mind and spoke of Mr Shrimp my rival's highheel'd shoes with detestation These were circumstances which I thought strongly in my favour so after resolving and reresolving I had courage enough to tell her my mind Miss heard my proposal with serenity seeming at the same time to study the figures of her fan Out at last it came There was but one small objection to complete our happiness which was no more than that she was married three months before to Mr Shrimp with highheel'd shoes By way of consolation however she observed that though I was disappointed in her my addresses to her aunt would probably kindle her into sensibility as the old lady always allowed me to be very goodnatured  and not to have the least share of harm in me  Yet still I had friends numerous friends and to them I was resolved to apply O Friendship thou fond soother of the human breast to thee we fly in every calamity to thee the wretched seek for succour on thee the caretired son of misery fondly relies from thy kind assistance the unfortunate always hopes relief and may be ever sure ofdisappointment My first application was to a city scrivener who had frequently offered to lend me money when he knew I did not want it I informed him that now was the time to put his friendship to the test that I wanted to borrow a couple of hundreds for a certain occasion and was resolved to take it up from him And pray Sir cried my friend do you want all this money Indeed I never wanted it more returned I I am sorry for that cries the scrivener with all my heart for they who want money when they come to borrow will always want money when they should come to pay  From him I flew with indignation to one of the best friends I had in the world and made the same request Indeed Mr Drybone cries my friend I always thought it would come to this You know Sir I would not advise you but for your own good but your conduct has hitherto been ridiculous in the highest degree and some of your  acquaintance always thought you a very silly fellow Let me seeyou want two hundred pounds do you want only two hundred Sir exactly To confess a truth returned I I shall want three hundred but then I have another friend from whom I can borrow the rest Why then replied my friend if you would take my adviceand you know I should not presume to advise you but for your own goodI would recommend it to you to borrow the whole sum from that other friend and then one note will serve for all you know  Poverty now began to come fast upon me yet instead of growing more provident or cautious as I grew poor I became every day more indolent and simple A friend was arrested for fifty pounds I was unable to extricate him except by becoming his bail When at liberty he fled from his creditors and left me to take his place In prison I expected greater satisfaction than I had enjoyed at large I hoped to converse with men in this new world simple and believing like myself but I found them as cunning and as cautious as those in the world I had left behind They spunged up my money whilst it lasted borrowed my coals and never paid them and cheated me when I played at cribbage All this was done because they believed me to be very goodnatured and knew that I had no harm in me  Upon my first entrance into this mansion which is to some the abode of despair I felt no sensations  different from those I experienced abroad I was now on one side the door and those who were unconfined were on the other this was all the difference between us At first indeed I felt some uneasiness in considering how I should be able to provide this week for the wants of the week ensuing but after some time if I found myself sure of eating one day I never troubled my head how I was to be supplied another I seized every precarious meal with the utmost goodhumour indulged no rants of spleen at my situation never called down heaven and all the stars to behold me dining upon an halfpennyworth of radishes my very companions were taught to believe that I liked sallad better than mutton I contented myself with thinking that all my life I should either eat white bread or brown considered that all that happened was best laughed when I was not in pain took the world as it went and read Tacitus often for want of more books and company  How long I might have continued in this torpid state of simplicity I cannot tell had I not been roused by seeing an old acquaintance whom I knew to be a prudent blockhead preferred to a place in the government I now found that I had pursued a wrong track and that the true way of being able to relieve others was to aim at independance myself My immediate care therefore was to leave my present habitation and make an entire reformation  in my conduct and behaviour For a free open undesigning deportment I put on that of closeness prudence and oeconomy One of the most heroic actions I ever performed and for which I shall praise myself as long as I live was the refusing half a crown to an old acquaintance at the time when he wanted it and I had it to spare for this alone I deserve to be decreed an ovation  I now therefore pursued a course of uninterrupted frugality seldom wanted a dinner and was consequently invited to twenty I soon began to get the character of a saving hunks that had money and insensibly grew into esteem Neighbours have asked my advice in the disposal of their daughters and I have always taken care not to give any I have contracted a friendship with an alderman only by observing that if we take a farthing from a thousand pound it will be a thousand pound no longer I have been invited to a pawnbroker's table by pretending to hate gravy and am now actually upon treaty of marriage with a rich widow for only having observed that bread was rising If ever I am asked a question whether I know it or not instead of answering I only smile and look wise If a charity is proposed I go about with the hat but put nothing in myself If a wretch solicits my pity I observe that the world is filled with impostors and take a certain method of not being deceived  by never relieving In short I now find the truest way of finding esteem even from the indigent is  to give away

narrow sphere around him beholds nature with a finer relish and tastes her blessings with a keener appetite than the philosopher whose mind attempts to grasp an universal system  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  CONVERSATION OF A FINE WOMAN  THERE is something irresistibly pleasing in the conversation of a fine woman even though her tongue be silent the eloquence of her eyes teaches wisdom The mind sympathises with the regularity of the object in view and struck with external grace vibrates into respondent harmony  IBID v p  SORROW  WE should feel sorrow but not sink under its oppression the heart of a wise man should resemble a mirrour which reflects every object without being sullied by any The wheel of fortune turns incessantly round and who can say within himself I shall today be uppermost We should hold the immutable mean that lies between insensibility and anguish our attempts should be not to extinguish  nature but to repress it not to stand unmoved at distress but endeavour to turn every disaster to our own advantage Our greatest glory is not in never falling but in rising every time we fall  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  READING  IT is of no importance to read much except you be regular in your reading If it be interrupted for any considerable time it can never be attended with proper improvement There are some who study for one day with intense application and repose themselves for ten days after But wisdom is a coquette and must be courted with unabating assiduity  It was a saying of the ancients that a man never opens a book without reaping some advantage by it I say with them that every book can serve to make us more expert except romances and these are no better than instruments of debauchery They are dangerous fictions where love is the ruling passion  IBID vol p  INDOLENCE  INDOLENCE assumes the airs of wisdom and while it tosses the cup and ball with infantine folly desires the world to look on and calls the stupid pastime philosophy and learning  IBID p  EDUCATING CHILDREN  I HAVE ever found it a vain task to try to make a child's learning its amusement nor do I see what good end it would answer were it actually attained The child ought to have its share of play and it will be benefited thereby and for every reason also it ought to have its share of labour The mind by early labour will be thus accustomed to fatigues and subordination and whatever be the person's future employment in life he will be better fitted to endure it he will be thus enabled to support the drudgeries of office with content or to fill up the vacancies of life with variety The child therefore should by times be put to its duty and be taught to know that the task is to be done or the punishment to be endured I do not object against alluring it to duty by reward but we well know that the mind will be more strongly stimulated by pain and both may upon some occasions take their turn to operate In this manner a child by playing with its equals abroad and labouring with them at school will acquire more health and knowledge than by being bred up under the wing of any speculative systemmaker and will be thus qualified for a life of activity and obedience It is true indeed that when educated in this manner the boy may not be so seemingly sensible and forward as one bred up under solitary instruction and perhaps this early forwardness is more engaging  than useful It is well known that many of those children who are such prodigies of literature before ten have not made an adequate progress to twenty It should seem that they only began learning manly things before their time and while others were busied in picking up that knowledge adapted to their age and curiosity these were forced upon subjects unsuited to their years and upon that account alone appearing extraordinary The stock of knowledge in both may be equal but with this difference that each is yet to learn what the other knows  HIST OF ANIMALS p  FELICITY  VAIN very vain my weary search to find  That bliss which only centers in the mind  Why have I stray'd from pleasure and repose  To seek a good each government bestows  In ev'ry government though terrors reign  Though tyrant kings or tyrant laws restrain  How small of all that human hearts endure  That part which laws or kings can cause or cure  Still to ourselves in ev'ry place consign'd  Our own felicity we make or find  With secret course which no loud storms annoy  Glides the smooth current of domestic joy  TRAVELLER p  INSOLENCE OF COURT FAVOURITES  AS in a family the faults and the impertinence of servants are often to be ascribed to their masters so in a state the vices and the insolence of favourites should be justly attributed to the king who employs them  HIST OF ENG IN LET c v p  FIDELITY OF A DOG  OF all the beasts that graze the lawn or hunt the forest a Dog is the only animal that leaving his fellows attempts to cultivate the friendship of man to man he looks in all his necessities with a speaking eye for assistance exerts for him all the little service in his power with chearfulness and pleasure for him bears famine and fatigue with patience and resignation no injuries can abate his fidelity no distress induce him to forsake his benefactor studious to please and fearing to offend he is still an humble steadfast dependant and in him alone fawning is not flattery How unkind then to torture this faithful creature who has left the forest to claim the protection of man How ungrateful a return to the trusty animal for all its services  ESSAY p  PLEASURE  ALL our pleasures though seemingly never so remote from sense derive their origin from some one of the senses The most exquisite demonstration in mathematics or the most pleasing disquisition in metaphysics if it does not ultimately tend to increase some sensual satisfaction is delightful only to fools or to men who have by long habit contracted a false idea of pleasure and he who separates sensual and sentimental enjoyments seeking happiness from mind alone is in fact as wretched as the naked inhabitant of the forest who places all happiness in the first regardless of the latter There are two extremes in this respect the savage who swallows down the draught of pleasure without staying to reflect on his happiness and the sage who passeth the cup while he reflects on the conveniences of drinking  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  WANT OF PRUDENCE  WANT of prudence is too frequently the want of virtue nor is there on earth a more powerful advocate for vice than poverty  IBID p  DUTY OF CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS  THE duty of children to their parents a duty which nature implants in every breast forms the  strength of that government which has subsisted for time immemorial Filial obedience is the first and greatest requisite of a state by this we become good subjects capable of behaving with just subordination to our superiors and grateful dependants on heaven by this we become fonder of marriage in order to be capable of exacting obedience from others in our turn by this we become good magistrates for early submission is the truest lesson to those who would learn to rule By this the whole state may be said to resemble one family of which the Emperor is the protector father and friend  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  POPULAR GLORY CONTRASTED WITH TRUE GLORY  POPULAR GLORY is a perfect coquette her lovers must toil feel every inquietude indulge every caprice and perhaps at last be jilted for their pains True glory on the other hand resembles a woman of sense her admirers must play no tricks they feel no great anxiety for they are sure in the end of being rewarded in proportion to their merit When  Swift  used to appear in public he generally had the mob shouting in his train  "Pox take these fools" he would say "how much joy might all this bawling give my LordMayor"  ESSAY p  LOVE  LOVE when founded in the heart will shew itself in a thousand unpremeditated sallies of fondness but every cool deliberate exhibition of the passion only argues little understanding or great insincerity  Choang  was the fondest husband and  Hansi  the most endearing wife in all the kingdom of  Korea  they were a pattern of conjugal bliss the inhabitants of the country around saw and envied their felicity wherever  Choang  came  Hansi  was sure to follow and in all the pleasures of  Hansi Choang  was admitted a partner They walked hand in hand wherever they appeared shewing every mark of mutual satisfaction embracing kissing their mouths were for ever joined and to speak in the language of anatomy it was with them one perpetual anastomosis  Their love was so great that it was thought nothing could interrupt their mutual peace when an accident happened which in some measure diminished the husband's assurance of his wife's fidelity for love so refined as his was subject to a thousand little disquietudes  Happening to go one day alone among the tombs that lay at some distance from his house he there perceived a lady dressed in the deepest mourning  being cloathed all over in white fanning the wet clay that was raised over one of the graves with a large fan which she held in her hand  Choang  who had early been taught wisdom in the school of  Lao  was unable to assign a cause for her present employment and coming up civilly demanded the reason  "Alas" replied the lady her eyes bathed in tears "how is it possible to survive the loss of my husband who lies buried in this grave He was the best of men the tenderest of husbands with his dying breath he bid me never marry again till the earth over his grave should be dry and here you see me steadily resolving to obey his will and endeavouring to dry it with my fan I have employed two whole days in fulfilling his commands and am determined not to marry till they are punctually obeyed even though his grave should take up four days in drying"  Choang  who was struck with the widow's beauty could not however avoid smiling at her haste to be married but concealing the cause of his mirth civilly invited her home adding that he had a wife who might be capable of giving her some consolation As soon as he and his guest were returned he imparted to  Hansi  in private what he had seen and could not avoid expressing his uneasiness that such might be his own case if his dearest wife should one day happen to survive him  It is impossible to describe  Hansi  's resentment at so unkind a suspicion As her passion for him was not only great but extremely delicate she employed tears anger frowns and exclamations to chide his suspicions the widow herself was inveighed against and  Hansi  declared she was resolved never to sleep under the same roof with a wretch who like her could be guilty of such barefaced inconstancy The night was cold and stormy however the stranger was obliged to seek another lodging for  Choang  was not disposed to resist and  Hansi  would have her way  The widow had scarce been gone an hour when an old disciple of  Choang  's whom he had not seen for many years came to pay him a visit He was received with the utmost ceremony placed in the most honourable seat at supper and the wine began to circulate with great freedom  Choang  and  Hansi  exhibited open marks of mutual tenderness and unfeigned reconciliation nothing could equal their apparent happiness so fond an husband so obedient a wife few could behold without regretting their own infelicity when lo their happiness was at once disturbed by a most fatal accident  Choang  fell lifeless in an apoplectic fit upon the floor Every method was used but in vain for his recovery  Hansi  was at first inconsolable for his death after some hours however she found spirits to read his last will The ensuing day she began to moralize and talk wisdom the next day  she was able to comfort the young disciple and on the third to shorten a long story they both agreed to be married  There was now no longer mourning in the apartments the body of  Choang  was now thrust into an old coffin and placed in one of the meanest rooms there to lie unattended until the time prescribed by law for his interment In the mean time  Hansi  and the young disciple were arrayed in the most magnificent habits the bride wore in her nose a jewel of immense price and her lover was dressed in all the finery of his former master together with a pair of artificial whiskers that reached down to his toes The hour of their nuptials was arrived the whole family sympathised with their approaching happiness the apartments were brightened up with lights that diffused the most exquisite perfume and a lustre more bright than noonday The lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apartment with impatience when his servant approaching with terror in his countenance informed her that his master was fallen into a fit which would certainly be mortal unless the heart of a man lately dead could be obtained and applied to his breast She scarce waited to hear the end of his story when tucking up her clothes she ran with a mattock in her hand to the coffin where  Choang  lay resolving to apply the heart of her dead husband as a cure for the living She therefore struck the lid with the utmost violence In a few blows the coffin flew open  when the body which to all appearance had been dead began to move Terrified at the sight  Hansi  dropped the mattock and  Choang  walked out astonished at his own situation his wife's unusual magnificence and her more amazing surprise He went among the apartments unable to conceive the cause of so much splendour He was not long in suspence before his domestics informed him of every transaction since he first became insensible He could scarce believe what they told him and went in pursuit of  Hansi  herself in order to receive more certain information or to reproach her infidelity But she prevented his reproaches he found her weltering in blood for she had stabbed herself to the heart being unable to survive her shame and disappointment  Choang  being a philosopher was too wise to make any loud lamentations he thought it best to bear his loss with serenity so mending up the old coffin where he had lain himself he placed his faithless spouse in his room and unwilling that so many nuptial preparations should be expended in vain he the same night married the widow with the large fan  As they both were apprised of the foibles of each other beforehand they knew how to excuse them after marriage They lived together for many years in great tranquillity and not expecting rapture made a shift to find contentment  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  POVERTY  WHERE shall Poverty reside  To 'scape the pressure of contiguous pride  If to some common's fenceless limits stray'd  He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade  Those fenceless fields the sons of Wealth divide  And ev'n the bareworn common is deny'd  If to some city spedWhat waits him there  To see profusion that he must not share  To see ten thousand baleful arts combin'd  To pamper luxury and thin mankind  To see those joys the sons of Pleasure know  Extorted from his fellowcreature's woe  Here while the courtier glitters in brocade  There the pale artist plies the sickly trade  Here while the proud their longdrawn pomps display  There the black gibbet glooms beside the way  The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight reign  Here richly deck'd admits the gorgeous train  Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square  The rattling chariots clash the torches glare  Sure scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy  Sure these denote one universal joy  Are these thy serious thoughts Ah turn thine eyes  Where the poor houseless shiv'ring female lies  She once perhaps in village plenty bless'd  Has wept at tales of innocence distress'd  Her modest looks the cottage might adorn  Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn  Now lost to all her friends her virtue fled  Near her betrayer's door she lays her head  And pinch'd with cold and shrinking from the show'r  With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour  When idly first ambitious of the town  She left her wheel and robes of country brown  DESERTED VILLAGE p  JUSTICE  JUSTICE may be defined that virtue which impels us to give to every person what is his due In this extended sense of the word it comprehends the practice of every virtue which reason prescribes or society should expect Our duty to our Maker to each other and to ourselves are fully answered if we give them what we owe them Thus justice properly speaking is the only virtue and all the rest have their origin in it  The qualities of candour fortitude charity and generosity for instance are not in their own nature virtues and if ever they deserve the title it is owing only to justice which impels and directs them Without such a moderator candour might become indiscretion fortitude obstinacy charity imprudence and generosity mistaken profusion  ESSAY p  DISINTERESTED ACTION  A DISINTERESTED action if it be not conducted by justice is at best indifferent in its nature and not unfrequently even turns to vice The expences of society of presents of entertainments and the other helps to chearfulness are actions merely indifferent when not repugnant to a better method of disposing of our superfluities but they become vicious when they obstruct or exhaust our abilities from a more virtuous disposition of our circumstances  ESSAY p  TRUE GENEROSITY  TRUE generosity is a duty as indispensibly necessary as those imposed upon us by law It is a rule imposed upon us by reason which should be the sovereign law of a rational being But this generosity does not consist in obeying every impulse of humanity in following blind passion for our guide and impairing our circumstances by present benefactions so as to render us incapable of future ones  IBID p  LITERATURE  WHATEVER be the motives which induce men to write whether avarice or fame the country becomes most wise and happy in which they  most serve for instructors The countries where sacerdotal instruction alone is permitted remain in ignorance superstition and hopeless slavery In England where there are as many new books published as in all the rest of Europe together a spirit of freedom and reason reigns among the people they have been often known to act like fools they are generally found to think like men  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  DEATH OF A PHILOSOPHER  LET others bestrew the hearses of the great with panegyric When a philosopher dies I consider myself as losing a patron an instructor and a friend I consider the world as losing one who might serve to console her amidst the desolations of war and ambition Nature every day produces in abundance men capable of filling all the requisite duties of authority but she is niggard in the birth of an exalted mind scarcely producing in a century a single genius to bless and enlighten a degenerate age Prodigal in the production of kings governors mandarines chams and courtiers she seems to have forgotten for more than three thousand years the manner in which she once formed the brain of a Confucius and well it is she has forgotten when a bad world gave him so very bad a reception  IBID v p  TENDERNESS  TENDERNESS without a capacity of relieving only makes the man who feels it more wretched than the object which sues for assistance  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  ESSAY ON FRIENDSHIP  THERE are few subjects which have been more written upon and less understood than that of Friendship To follow the dictates of some this virtue instead of being the assuager of pain becomes the source of every inconvenience Such speculatists by expecting too much from friendship dissolve the connexion and by drawing the bands too closely at length break them Almost all our romance and novelwriters are of this kind they persuade us to friendships which we find impossible to sustain to the last so that this sweetner of life under proper regulations is by their means rendered inaccessible or uneasy It is certain the best method to cultivate this virtue is by letting it in some measure make itself a similitude of minds or studies and even sometimes a diversity of pursuits will produce all the pleasures that arise from it The current of tenderness widens as it proceeds and two men imperceptibly find their hearts warm with goodnature far each other  when they were at first only in pursuit of mirth or relaxation  Friendship is like a debt of honour the moment it is talked of it loses its real name and assumes the more ungrateful form of obligation From hence we find that those who regularly undertake to cultivate friendship find ingratitude generally repays their endeavours That circle of beings which dependance gathers round us is almost ever unfriendly they secretly wish the term of their connexions more nearly equal and where they even have the most virtue are prepared to reserve all their affections for their patron only in the hour of his decline Increasing the obligations which are laid upon such minds only increases their burthen they feel themselves unable to repay the immensity of their debt and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent resentment at the hand that it stretched out with offers of service and relief  Plautinus  was a man who thought that every good was bought from riches and as he was possessed of great wealth and had a mind naturally formed for virtue he resolved to gather a circle of the best men round him Among the number of his dependants was  Musidorus  with a mind just as fond of virtue yet not less proud than his patron His circumstances however were such as forced him to stoop to the good offices of his superior  and he saw himself daily among a number of others loaded with benefits and protestations of friendship These in the usual course of the world he thought it prudent to accept but while he gave his esteem he could not give his heart A want of affection breaks out in the most trifling instances and  Plautinus  had skill enough to observe the minutest actions of the man he wished to make his friend In these he ever found his aim disappointed for  Musidorus  claimed an exchange of hearts which  Plautinus  solicited by a variety of claims could never think of bestowing  It may be easily supposed that the reserve of our poor proud man was soon construed into ingratitude and such indeed in the common acceptation of the world it was Wherever  Musidorus  appeared he was remarked as the ungrateful man he had acccepted favours it was said and had still the insolence to pretend to independance The event however justified his conduct  Plautinus  by misplaced liberality at length became poor and it was then that  Musidorus  first thought of making a friend of him He flew to the man of fallen fortune with an offer of all he had wrought under his direction with assiduity and by uniting their talents both were at length placed in that state of life from which one of them had formerly fallen  To this story taken from modern life I shall add one more taken from a Greek writer of antiquity  'Two Jewish soldiers in the time of  Vespasian  had made many campaigns together and a participation of dangers at length bred an union of hearts They were remarked throughout the whole army as the two friendly brothers they felt and fought for each other Their friendship might have continued without interruption till death had not the good fortune of the one alarmed the pride of the other which was in his promotion to be a Centurion under the famous John who headed a particular party of the Jewish malecontents  From this moment their former love was converted into the most inveterate enmity They attached themselves to opposite factions and sought each other's lives in the conflict of adverse party In this manner they continued for more than two years vowing mutual revenge and animated with an unconquerable spirit of aversion At length however that party of the  Jews  to which the mean soldier belonged joining with the  Romans  it became victorious and drove  John  with all his adherents into the Temple History has given us more than one picture of the dreadful conflagration of that superb edifice The  Roman  soldiers were gathered round it the whole  Temple  was in flames and thousands were seen amidst them within its sacred circuit It was in this  situation of things that the nowsuccessful soldier saw his former friend upon the battlements of the highest tower looking round with horror and just ready to be consumed with flames All his former tenderness now returned he saw the man of his bosom just going to perish and unable to withstand the impulse he ran spreading his arms and crying out to his friend to leap down from the top and find safety with him The Centurion from above heard and obeyed and casting himself from the top of the tower into his fellowsoldier's arms both fell a sacrifice on the spot one being crushed to death by the weight of his companion and the other dashed to pieces by the greatness of his fall'  THE COUNTRY ALEHOUSE  NEAR yonder thorn that lifts its head on high  Where once the signpost caught the passing eye  Low lies that house where nutbrown draughts inspir'd  Where greybeard

lived  Sabinus  a youth formed by Nature to make a conquest  wherever he thought proper but the constancy of his disposition fixed him only with  Olinda  He was indeed superior to her in fortune but that defect on her side was so amply supplied by her merit that none was thought more worthy of his regards than she He loved her he was beloved by her and in a short time by joining hands publicly they avowed the union of their hearts But alas none however fortunate however happy are exempt from the shafts of envy and the malignant effects of ungoverned appetite How unsafe how detestable are they who have this fury for their guide How certainly will it lead them from themselves and plunge them in errors they would have shuddered at even in apprehension  Ariana  a lady of many amiable qualities very nearly allied to  Sabinus  and highly esteemed by him imagined herself slighted and injuriously treated since his marriage with  Olinda  By incautiously suffering this jealousy to corrode in her breast she began to give a loose to passion she forgot those many virtues for which she had been so long and so justly applauded Causeless suspicion and mistaken resentment betrayed her into all the gloom of discontent she sighed without ceasing the happiness of others gave her intolerable pain she thought of nothing but revenge How unlike what she was the chearful the prudent the compassionate  Ariana  She continually laboured to disturb an union so firmly so affectionately founded and planned every scheme which she thought most likely to disturb it  Fortune seemed willing to promote her unjust intentions the circumstances of  Sabinus  had been long embarrassed by a tedious lawsuit and the court determining the cause unexpectedly in favour of his opponent it sunk his fortune to the lowest pitch of penury from the highest affluence  From the nearness of relationship  Sabinus  expected from  Ariana  those assistances his present situation required but she was insensible to all his entreaties and the justice of every remonstrance unless he first separated from  Olinda  whom she regarded with detestation Upon a compliance with her desires in this respect she promised her fortune her interest and her all should be at his command  Sabinus  was shocked at the proposal he loved his wife with inexpressible tenderness and refused those offers with indignation which were to be purchased at so high a price  Ariana  was no less displeased to find her offers rejected and gave a loose to all that warmth which she had long endeavoured to suppress  Reproach generally produces recrimination the quarrel rose to such a height that  Sabinus  was marked for destruction and the very next day  the strength of an old family debt he was sent to jail with none but  Olinda  to comfort him in his miseries In this mansion of distress they lived together with resignation and even with comfort She provided the frugal meal and he read for her while employed in the little offices of domestic concern Their fellowprisoners admired their contentment and whenever they had a desire of relaxing into mirth and enjoying those little comforts that a prison affords  Sabinus  and  Olinda  were sure to be of the party Instead of reproaching each for their mutual wretchedness they both lightened it by bearing each a share of the load imposed by Providence Whenever  Sabinus  shewed the least concern on his dear partner's account she conjured him by the love he bore her by those tender ties which now united them for ever not to discompose himself that so long as his affection lasted the defied all the ills of fortune and every loss of fame or friendship that no thing could make her miserable but his seeming to want happiness nothing pleased but his sympathising with her pleasure  A continuance in prison soon robbed them of the little they had left and famine began to make its horrid appearance yet still was neither found to murmur they both looked upon their little boy who insensible of their or his own distress was playing about the room with inexpressible yet silent anguish when a messenger came to inform them that  Ariana  was dead and that her will in favour of a very distant relation and who was now in another country might be easily procured and burnt in which case all her large fortune would revert to him as being the next heir at law  A proposal of so base a nature filled our unhappy couple with horror they ordered the messenger immediately out of the room and falling upon each other's neck indulged an agony of sorrow for now even all hopes of relief were banished The messenger who made the proposal however was only a spy sent by  Ariana  to sound the dispositions of a man she loved at once and persecuted  This lady though warped by wrong passions was naturally kind judicious and friendly She found that all her attempts to shake the constancy or the integrity of  Sabinus  were ineffectual She had therefore begun to reflect and to wonder how she could so long and so unprovoked injure such uncommon fortitude and affection  She had from the next room herself heard the reception given to the messenger and could not avoid feeling all the force of superior virtue she therefore reassumed her former goodness of heart she came into the room with tears in her eyes and acknowledged the severity of her former treatment She bestowed her first care in  providing them all the necessary supplies and acknowledged them as the most deserving heirs of her fortune From this moment  Sabinus  enjoyed an uninterrupted happiness with  Olinda  and both were happy in the friendship and assistance of  Ariana  who dying soon after left them in possession of a large estate and in her last moments confessed that Virtue was the only path to true glory and that however Innocence may for a time be depressed a steady perseverance will in time lead it to a certain victory  INNOCENCE AND SIMPLICITY  MAN was born to live with innocence and simplicity but he has deviated from Nature he was born to share the bounties of Heaven but he has monopolized them he was born to govern the brute creation but he is become their tyrant If an epicure now should happen to surfeit on his last night's feast twenty animals the next day are to undergo the most exquisite tortures in order to provoke his appetite to another guilty meal Hail O ye simple honest Bramins of the East ye inoffensive friends of all that were born to happiness as well as you You never sought a shortlived pleasure from the miseries of other creatures You never studied the tormenting arts of ingenious refinement you never surfeited upon a guilty meal  How much more purified and refined are all your sensations than ours You distinguish every element with the utmost precision a stream untasted before is new luxury a change of air is a new banquet too refined for western imaginations to conceive  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  ADULATION  THE man who is constantly served up with adulation must be a firstrate philosopher if he can listen without contracting new affectations The opinion we form of ourselves is generally measured by what we hear from others and when they conspire to deceive we too readily concur in the delusion Among the number of muchapplauded men in the circle of our own friends we can recollect but few that have heads quite strong enough to bear a loud acclamation of public praise in their favour among the whole list we shall scarce find one that has not thus been made on some side of his character a coxcomb  LIFE OF NASH p  THE SWISS PEASANT  MY soul turn from them  From the  Italians  turn we to survey  Where rougher climes a nobler race display  Where the bleak  Swiss  their stormy mansions tread  And force a churlish soil for scanty bread  No product here the barren hills afford  But man and steel the soldier and his sword  No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array  But Winter ling'ring chills the lap of  May    No Zephyr fondly sues the mountain's breast  But meteors glare and stormy glooms invest  Yet still ev'n here Content can spread a charm  Redress the clime and all its rage disarm  Though poor the Peasant's hut his feasts though small  He sees his little lot the lot of all  Sees no contiguous palace rear its head  To shame the meanness of his humble shed  No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal  To make him loath his vegetable meal  But calm and bred in ignorance and toil  Each wish contracting sits him to the soil  Chearful at morn he wakes from short repose  Breasts the keen air and carrols as he goes  With patient angle trolls the finny deep  Or drives his vent'rous ploughshare to the steep  Or seeks the den where snowtracks mark the way  And drags the struggling savage into day  At right returning ev'ry labour sped  He sits him down the monarch of a shed  Smiles by his chearful sire and round surveys  His children's looks that brighten at the blaze  While his lov'd partner boastful of her hoard  Displays her cleanly platter on the board  And haply too some pilgrim thither led  With many a tale repays the nightly bed  Thus ev'ry good his native wilds impart  Imprints the patriot passion on his heart  And ev'n those ills that round his mansion rise  Enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies  Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms  And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms  And as a child when scaring sounds molest  Clings close and closer to the mother's breast  So the loud torrent and the whirlwind's roar  But bind him to his native mountains more  TRAVELLER p  AGE  AGE that lessens the enjoyment of life increases our desire of living Those dangers which in the vigour of youth we had learned to despise assume new terrors as we grow old Our caution increasing as our years increase fear becomes at last the prevailing passion of the mind and the small remainder of life is taken up in useless efforts  to keep off our end or provide for a continued existence  ESSAY  HOPE THE LAMP OF LIFE  IF I should judge of that part of life which lies before me by that which I have already seen the prospect is hideous Experience tells me that my past enjoyments have brought no real felicity and sensation assures me that those I have felt are stronger than those which are yet to come Yet experience and sensation in vain persuade hope more powerful than either dresses out the distant prospect in fancied beauty some happiness in long perspective still beckons me to pursue and like a losing gamester every new disappointment increases my ardour to continue the game  ESSAY  LOVE OF LIFE  WHENCE this increased love of life which grows upon us with our years Whence comes it that we thus make greater efforts to preserve our existence at a period when it becomes scarce worth the keeping Is it that nature attentive to the preservation of mankind increases our wishes to live while she lessens our enjoyments and as she robs the senses of every pleasure equips imagination in the spoil Life would be insupportable to an old man who loaded with infirmities feared  death no more than when in the vigour of manhood the numberless calamities of decaying nature and the consciousness of surviving every pleasure would at once induce him with his own hand to terminate the scene of misery but happily the contempt of death forsakes him at a time when it could only be prejudicial and life acquires an imaginary value in proportion as its real value is no more  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  ATTACHMENT  OUR attachment to every object around us increases in general from the length of our acquaintance with it I would not chuse says a  French  philosopher to see an old post pulled up with which I had been long acquainted A mind long habituated to a certain set of objects insensibly becomes fond of seeing them visits them from habit and parts from them with reluctance From hence proceeds the avarice of the old in every kind of possession They love the world and all that it produces they love life and all its advantages not because it gives them pleasure but because they have known it long  CHINVANG the Chaste ascending the throne of  China  commanded that all who were unjustly detained in prison during the preceding reigns  should be set free Among the number who came to thank their deliverer on this occasion there appeared a majestic old man who falling at the emperor's feet addressed him as follows  "Great father of  China  behold a wretch now eightyfive years old who was shut up in a dungeon at the age of twentytwo I was imprisoned though a stranger to crime or without being even confronted by my accusers I have now lived in solitude and darkness for more than fifty years and am grown familiar with distress As yet dazzled with the splendour of that sun to which you have restored me I have been wandering the streets to find some friend that would assist or relieve or remember me but my friends my family and relations are all dead and I am forgotten Permit me then O  Chinvang  to wear out the wretched remains of life in my former prison the walls of my dungeon are to me more pleasing than the most splendid palace I have not long to live and shall be unhappy except I spend the rest of my days where my youth was passed in that prison from whence you were pleased to release me"  The old man's passion for confinement is similar to that we all have for life We are habituated to the prison we look round with discontent are displeased with the abode and yet the length of our captivity only increases our fondness for the cell The trees we have planted the houses we have built or the posterity we have begotten all  serve to bind us closer to earth and embitter our parting Life sues the young like a new acquaintance the companion as yet unexhausted is at once instructive and amusing its company pleases yet for all this it is but little regarded To us who are declined in years life appears like an old friend its jests have been anticipated in former conversation it has no new story to make us smile no new improvement with which to surprise yet still we love it destitute of every agreement still we love it husband the wasting treasure with increased frugality and feel all the poignancy of anguish in the fatal separation  ESSAY  DRESS  DRESS has a mechanical influence upon the mind and we naturally are awed into respect and esteem at the elegance of those whom even our reason would teach us to contemn  LIFE OF NASH p  EFFRONTERY  HOW many little things do we see without merit or without friends push themselves forward into public notice and by selfadvertising attract the attention of the day The wise despise them but the public are not all wise Thus they succeed  rise upon the wing of folly or of fashion and by their success give a new sanction to effrontery  LIFE OF NASH p  SYMPATHETIC SINCERITY  THE low and timid are ever suspicious but a heart impressed with honourable sentiments expects from others sympathetic sincerity  LIFE OF NASH p  FAVOUR  THERE are some who born without any share of sensibility receive favour after favour and still cringe for more who accept the offer of generosity with as little reluctance as the wages of merit and even make thanks for past benefits an indirect petition for new Such I grant can suffer no debasement from dependance since they were originally as vile as was possible to be Dependance degrades only the ingenuous but leaves the sordid mind in pristine meanness In this manner therefore longcontinued generosity is misplaced or it is injurious it either finds a man worthless or it makes him so and true it is that the person who is contented to be  often  obliged ought not to have been obliged at all  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  BENEFACTION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  BENEFACTION and acknowledgement are often injurious even to the giver as well as the receiver a man can gain but little knowledge of himself or of the world amidst a circle of those whom hope or gratitude has gathered round him their unceasing humiliations must necessarily increase his comparative magnitude for all men measure their own abilities by those of their company thus being taught to overrate his merit he in reality lessens it increasing in confidence but not in power his professions end in empty boast his undertakings in shameful disappointment  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  ACCIDENTAL MEETINGS  ACCIDENTAL meetings though they happen every day seldom excite our surprise but upon some extraordinary occasion To what a fortuitous concurrence do we not owe every pleasure and convenience of our lives How many seeming accidents must unite before we can be cloathed or fed The peasant must be disposed to labour the shower must fall the wind fill the merchant's sail or numbers must want the usual supply  VIC OF WAKEFIELD v p  TIDINGS  THE distant sounds of music that catch new sweetness as they vibrate

every practical treatise of ethics tends to increase our sensibility of the distresses of others and to relax the grasp of frugality Philosophers that are poor praise it because they are gainers by

must observe it once more that the hours we pass with happy prospects in view are more pleasing than those crowned with fruition In the first case we cook the dish to our own appetite in the latter

their very education are incompetent judges Men who being always bred in affluence see the world only on one side are surely improper judges of human nature they may indeed describe a ceremony a pageant or a ball but how can they pretend to dive into the secrets of the human heart who have been nursed up only in forms and daily behold nothing but the same insipid adulation smiling upon every face Few of them have been bred in that best of schools the school of adversity and by what I can learn fewer still have been bred in any school at all  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  LOVE OF COUNTRY  THERE are no pleasures sensual or sentimental which this city  London  does not produce yet I know not how I could not be content to reside here for life There is something so seducing in that spot in which we first had existence that nothing but it can please whatever vicissitudes we experience in life however we toil or wheresoever we wander our fatigued wishes still recur to home for tranquillity we long to die in that spot which  gave us birth and in that pleasing expectation opiate every calamity  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  DR PRIMROSE's ADDRESS TO HIS FELLOWPRISONERS THE EQUAL DEALINGS OF PROVIDENCE DEMONSTRATED WITH REGARD TO THE HAPPY AND THE MISERABLE HERE BELOW THAT FROM THE NATURE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN THE WRETCHED MUST BE REPAID THE BALANCE OF THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE LIFE HEREAFTER  MY friends my children and fellowsufferers when I reflect on the distribution of good and evil here below I find that much has been given man to enjoy yet still more to suffer Though we should examine the whole world we shall not find one man so happy as to have nothing left to wish for but we daily see thousands who by suicide shew us they have nothing left to hope In this life then it appears that we cannot be entirely blest but yet we may be completely miserable  Why man should thus feel pain why our wretchedness should be requisite in the formation of universal felicity why when all other systems are made perfect only by the perfection of their subordinate parts the great system should require  for its perfection parts that are not only subordinate to others but imperfect in themselves These are questions that never can be explained and might be useless if known On this subject Providence has thought fit to elude our curiosity satisfied with granting us motives to consolation  In this situation man has called in the friendly assistance of Philosophy and Heaven seeing the incapacity of that to console him has given him the aid of Religion The consolations of Philosophy are very amusing but often fallacious It tells us that life is filled with comforts if we will but enjoy them and on the other hand that though we unavoidably have miseries here life is is short and they will soon be over Thus do these consolations destroy each other for if life is a place of comfort its shortness must be misery and if it be long our griefs are protracted Thus philosophy is weak but religion comforts in an higher strain Man is here it tells us fitting up his mind and preparing it for another abode When the good man leaves the body and is all a glorious mind he will find he has been making himself a heaven of happiness here while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices shrinks from his body with terror and finds that he has anticipated the vengeance of Heaven To Religion then we must hold in every circumstance of life for our truest comfort for if already we are happy it is a pleasure to think that  we can make that happiness unending and if we are miserable it is very consoling to think that there is a place of rest Thus to the fortunate Religion holds out a continuance of bliss to the wretched a change from pain  But though Religion is very kind to all men it has promised peculiar reward to the unhappy the sick the naked the houseless the heavyladen and the prisoner have ever most frequent promises in our sacred law The Author of our Religion every where professes himself the wretch's friend and unlike the false ones of this world bestows all his caresses upon the forlorn The unthinking have censured this as a partiality as a preference without merit to deserve it but they never reflect that it is not in the power even of Heaven itself to make the offer of unceasing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miserable To the first eternity is but a single blessing since at most it but increases what they already possess To the latter it is a double advantage for it diminishes their pain here and rewards them with heavenly bliss hereafter  But Providence is in another respect kinder to the poor than the rich for as it thus makes the life after death more desirable so it smooths the passage there The wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror The man of sorrows  lays himself quietly down he has no possessions to regret and but few ties to stop his departure he feels only Nature's pang in the final separation and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before for after a certain degree of pain every new breach that death opens in the constitution nature kindly covers with insensibility  Thus Providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life greater felicity in dying and in Heaven all the superiority of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment And this superiority my friends is no small advantage and seems to be one of the pleasures of the poor man in the parable for though he was already in Heaven and felt all the raptures it could give yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happiness that he had once been wretched and now was comforted that he had known what it was to be miserable and now felt what it was to be happy  Thus my friends you see Religion does what Philosophy could never do it shews the equal dealings of Heaven to the happy and the unhappy and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the same standard It gives to both rich and poor the same happiness hereafter and equal hopes to aspire after it but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleasure here the poor have the endless  satisfaction of knowing what it was once to be miserable when crowned with endless felicity hereafter and even though this should be called a small advantage yet being an eternal one it must make up by duration what the temporal happiness of the great may have exceeded by intenseness  These are therefore the consolations which the wretched have peculiar to themselves and in which they are above the rest of mankind in other respects they are below them They who would know the miseries of the poor must see life and endure it To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy is only repeating what none either believe or practise The men who have the necessaries of living are not poor and they who want them must be miserable Yes my friends we must be miserable No vain efforts of a refined imagination can soothe the wants of nature can give elastic sweetness to the dank vapour of a dungeon or ease to the throbbings of a woeworn heart Let the Philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that we can resist all these Alas the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain Death is slight and any man may sustain it but torments are dreadful and these no man can endure  To us then my friends the promises of happiness in Heaven should be peculiarly dear for if  our reward be in this life alone we are then indeed of all men the most miserable When I look round these gloomy walls made to terrify as well as to confine us this light that only serves to shew the horrors of the place those shackles that tyranny has imposed or crime made necessary when I survey these emaciated looks and hear those groans O my friends what a glorious exchange would Heaven be for these To fly through regions unconfined as air to bask in the sunshine of eternal bliss to carol over endless hymns of praise to have no master to threaten or insult us but the form of Goodness himself for ever in our eyes when I think of these things Death becomes the messenger of very glad tidings when I think of these things his sharpest arrow becomes the staff of my support when I think of these things what is there in life worth having when I think of these things what is there that should not be spurned away Kings in their palaces should groan for such advantages but we humbled as we are should yearn for them  And shall these things be ours Ours they will certainly be if we but try for them and what is a comfort we are shut up from many temptations that would retard our pursuit Only let us try for them and they will certainly be ours and what is still a comfort shortly too for if we look back on past life it appears but a very short span and whatever we may think of the rest of  life it will yet be found of less duration as we grow older the days seem to grow shorter and our intimacy with time ever lessens the perception of his stay Then let us take comfort now for we shall soon be at our journey's end we shall soon lay down the heavy burthen laid by Heaven upon us and though Death the only friend of the wretched for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view and like his horizon still flies before him yet the time will certainly and shortly come when we shall cease from our toil when the luxurious great ones of the world shall no more tread us to the earth when we shall think with pleasure on our sufferings below when we shall be surrounded with all our friends or such as deserved our friendship when our bliss shall be unutterable and still to crown all unending  VIC OF WAKEFIELD v p  PARTY  PARTY entirely distorts the judgment and destroys the taste When the mind is once infected with this disease it can only find pleasure in what contributes to increase the distemper Like the tiger that seldom desists from pursuing man after having once preyed upon human flesh the Reader who has once gratified his appetite with calumny makes ever after the most agreeable feast upon murdered reputation Such Readers

past  DESERTED VILLAGE p  RIDICULE  RIDICULE has ever been the most powerful enemy of enthusiasm and properly the only antagonist that can be opposed to it with success Persecution only serves to propagate new religions they acquire fresh vigour beneath the executioner and the ax and like some vivacious insects multiply by dissection It is also impossible to combat enthusiasm with reason for though it makes a shew of resistance it soon eludes the pressure refers you to distinctions not to be understood and feelings which it cannot explain A man who would endeavour to fix an enthusiast by argument might as well attempt to spread quicksilver with his singers The only way to conquer a visionary is to despise him the stake the faggot and the disputing Doctor in some measure ennoble the opinions they are brought to oppose they are harmless against innovating pride contempt alone is truly dreadful Hunters generally know the most vulnerable part of the beasts they pursue by the care which every animal takes to defend the side which is weakest on what side the enthusiast is most vulnerable may be known by the care which he takes in the beginning to work his disciples into gravity

peasant without fault is greater than the philosopher with many for what is genius or courage without an heart  VIC OF WAKEFIELD v p  STORY OF COLONEL  M    AT the conclusion of the treaty of peace at  Utrecht  Col  M  was one of the thoughtless agreeable gay creatures that drew the attention of the company at  Bath  He danced and talked with great vivacity and when he gamed among the ladies he shewed that his attention was employed rather upon their hearts than their fortunes His own fortune however was a trifle when compared to the elegance of his expence and his imprudence at last was so great that it obliged him to sell an annuity arising from his commission to keep up his splendour a little logger  However thoughtless he might be he had the happiness of gaining the affections of Miss  L  whose father designed her a very large fortune This lady was courted by a nobleman of distinc+tion but she refused his addresses resolved upon gratifying rather her inclinations than her avarice  The intrigue went on successfully between her and the Colonel and they both would certainly have been married and been undone had not Mr  Nash  apprised her father of their intentions The old gentleman recalled his daughter from  Bath  and offered Mr  Nash  a very considerable present for the care he had taken which he refused  In the mean time Col  M  had an intimation how his intrigue came to be discovered and by taxing Mr  Nash  found that his suspicions were not without foundation A challenge was the immediate consequence which the King of  Bath  conscious of having only done his duty thought proper to decline As none are permitted to wear swords at  Bath  the Colonel found no opportunity of gratifying his resentment and waited with impatience to find Mr  Nash  in town to require proper satisfaction  During this interval however he found his creditors became too importunate for him to remain longer at  Bath  and his finances and credit being quite exhausted he took the desperate resolution of going over to the  Dutch  army in  Flanders  where he enlisted himself a volunteer Here he underwent all the fatigues of a private centinel with the additional misery of receiving no pay and his friends in  England  gave out that he was shot at the battle of  In the mean time the nobleman pressed his passion with ardour but during the progress of his amour the young lady's father died and left her heiress to a fortune of fifteen hundred a year She thought herself now disengaged from her former passion An absence of two years had in some measure abated her love for the Colonel and the assiduity the merit and real regard of the gentleman who still continued to solicit her were almost too powerful for her constancy Mr  Nash  in the mean time took every opportunity of enquiring after Col  M  and found that he had for some time been returned to  England  but changed his name in order to avoid the fury of his creditors and that he was entered into a company of strolling players who were at that time exhibiting at  Peterborough  He now therefore thought he owed the Colonel in justice an opportunity of promoting his fortune as he had once deprived him of an occasion of satisfying his love Our Beau therefore invited the lady to be of a party to  Peterborough  and offered his own equipage which was then one of the most elegant in  England  to conduct her there The proposal being accepted the lady the nobleman and Mr  Nash  arrived in town just as the players were going to begin  Col  M  who used every means of remaining  incognito  and who was too proud to make his  distresses known to any of his former acquaintance was now degraded into the character of  Tom  in the  Conscious Lovers  Miss  L  was placed in the foremost row of the spectators her lord on one side and the impatient  Nash  on the other when the unhappy youth appeared in that despicable situation upon the stage The moment he came on his former mistress struck his view but his amazement was increased when he saw her fainting away in the arms of those who sat behind her He was incapable of proceeding and scarce knowing what he did he flew and caught her in his arms  "Colonel" cried  Nash  when they were in some measure recovered "you once thought me your enemy because I endeavoured to prevent you both from ruining each other you were then wrong and you have long had my forgiveness If you love well enough now for matrimony you fairly have my consent and dn him say I that attempts to part you"  Their nuptials were solemnised soon after and affluence added a zest to all their future enjoyments Mr  Nash  had the thanks of each and he afterwards spent several agreeable days in that society which he had contributed to render happy  LIFE OF NASH p  REVOLUTIONS OF LIFE  THE world is like a vast sea mankind like a vessel sailing on its tempestuous bosom Our prudence is its sails the sciences serve us for oars good or bad fortune are the favourable or contrary winds and judgment is the rudder without this last the vessel is tossed by every billow and will find shipwreck in every breeze In a word ob+scurity and indigence are the parents of vigilance and oeconomy vigilance and oeconomy of riches and honour riches and honour of pride and luxury pride and luxury of impurity and idleness and impurity and idleness again produce indigence and obscurity Such are the revolutions of life  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  MISERIES OF GENIUS IN VARIOUS AGES AND HER HAPPINESS IN THIS  THE character of a poet is in every country the same fond of enjoying the present careless of the future his conversation that of a man of sense his actions those of a fool Of fortitude able to stand unmoved at the bursting of an earthquake yet of sensibility to be affected by the breaking of a teacup Such is his character which considered in every light is the very opposite of that which leads to riches  The poets of the West are as remarkable for their indigence as their genius and yet among the numerous hospitals designed to relieve the poor I have heard of but one erected for the benefit of decayed authors This was founded by Pope  Urban  VIII and called the retreat of the incurables intimating that it was equally impossible to reclaim the patients who sued for reception from poverty or from poetry To be sincere were I to send you an account of the lives of the Western poets either ancient or modern I fancy you would think me employed in collecting materials for an history of human wretchedness  Homer  is the first poet and beggar of note among the ancients he was blind and sung his ballads about the streets but it is observed that his mouth was more frequently filled with verses than with bread  Plautus  the comic poet was better off he had two trades he was a poet for his diversion and helped to turn a mill in order to gain a livelihood  Terence  was a slave and  Boëthius  died in a jail  Among the  Italians Paulo Borghese  almost as good a poet as  Tasso  knew fourteen different trades and yet died because he could get employment in none  Tasso  himself who had the most amiable character of all poets has often been obliged to borrow a crown from some friend in order to pay for a month's subsistence He has left us a pretty  sonnet addressed to his cat in which he begs the light of her eyes to write by being too poor to afford himself a candle But  Bentivoglio  poor  Bentivoglio  chiefly demands our pity His comedies will last with the  Italian  language He dissipated a noble fortune in acts of charity and benevolence but falling into misery in his old age was refused to be admitted into an hospital which he himself had erected  In  Spain  it is said the great  Cervantes  died of hunger and it is certain that the famous  Camoens  ended his days in an hospital  If we turn to  France  we shall there find even stronger instances of the ingratitude of the public  Vaugelas  one of the politest writers and one of the honestest men of his time was surnamed  the Owl  from his being obliged to keep within all day and venture out only by night through fear of his creditors His last will is very remarkable after having bequeathed all his worldly substance to the discharging his debts he goes on thus But as there still may remain some creditors unpaid even after all that I have shall be disposed of in such a case it is my last will that my body should be sold to the surgeons to the best advantage and that the purchase should go to the discharging those debts which I owe to society so that if I could not while living at least when dead I may be useful  Cassander  was one of the greatest geniuses of his time yet all his merit could not procure him a bare subsistence Being by degrees driven into an hatred of all mankind from the little pity he found amongst them he even ventured at last ungratefully to impute his calamities to Providence In his last agonies when the priest intreated him to rely on the justice of heaven and ask mercy from him that made him  If God  replies he  has shewn me no justice here what reason have I to expect any from him hereafter  But being answered that a suspension of justice was no argument that should induce us to doubt of its reality let me intreat you continued his confessor by all that is dear to be reconciled to God your father your maker and friend  No  replied the exasperated wretch  you know the manner in which he left me to live  and pointing to the straw on which he was stretched  and you see the manner in which he leaves me to die  But the sufferings of the poet in other countries is nothing when compared to his distresses here the names of  Spenser  and  Otway Butler  and  Dryden  are every day mentioned as a national reproach some of them lived in a state of precarious indigence and others literally died of hunger  At present the few poets in  England  no longer depend on the Great for subsistence they have now no other patrons but the public and the public collectively considered is a good and a  generous master It is indeed too frequently mistaken as to the merits of every candidate for favour but to make amends it is never mistaken long A performance indeed may be forced for a time into reputation but destitute of real merit it soon sinks time the touchstone of what is truly valuable will soon discover the fraud and an author should never arrogate to himself any share of success till his works have been read at least ten years with satisfaction  A man of letters at present whose works are valuable is perfectly sensible of their value Every polite member of the community by buying what he writes contributes to reward him The ridicule therefore of living in a garret might have been wit in the last age but continues such no longer because no longer true A writer of real merit now may easily be rich if his heart be set only on fortune and for those who have no merit it is but sit that such should remain in merited obscurity He may now refuse an invitation to dinner without fearing to incur his patron's displeasure or to starve by remaining at home He may now venture to appear in company with just such clothes as other men generally wear and talk even to princes with all the conscious superiority of wisdom Though he cannot boast of fortune here yet he can bravely assert the dignity of independance  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  DISSEMBLING  KNOWLEDGE wisdom erudition arts and elegance what are they but the mere trappings of the mind if they do not serve to increase the happiness of the possessor A mind rightly instituted in the school of philosophy acquires at once the stability of the oak and the flexibility of the offer The truest manner of lessening our agonies is to shrink from their pressure is to confess that we feel them  The fortitude of sages is but a dream for where lies the merit in being insensible to the strokes of fortune or in dissembling our sensibility If we are insensible that arises only from an happy constitution that is a blessing previously granted by heaven and which no art can procure no institutions improve If we dissemble our feelings we only artificially endeavour to persuade others that we enjoy privileges which we actually do not possess Thus while we endeavour to appear happy we feel at once all the pangs of internal misery and all the selfreproaching consciousness of endeavouring to deceive  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  THE PASSIONS  PHILOSOPHERS have long declaimed against the passions as being the source of all our miseries  They are the source of all our misfortunes I own but they are the source of our pleasures too and every endeavour of our lives and all the institutions of philosophy should tend to this not to dissemble an absence of passion but to repel those which lead to vice by those which direct to virtue  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  THE SOUL  THE soul may be compared to a field of battle where two armies are ready every moment to encounter not a single vice but has a more powerful opponent and not one virtue but may be overborne by a combination of vices Reason guides the bands of either host nor can it subdue one passion but by the assistance of another Thus as a bark on every side beset with storms enjoys a state of rest so does the mind when influenced by a just equipoise of the passions enjoy tranquillity  IBID  LOVE  WHETHER love be natural or no it contributes to the happiness of every society into which it is introduced All our pleasures are short and can only charm at intervals love is a method of protracting our greatest pleasure and surely that gamester who plays the greatest stake to the best advantage will at the end of life rise victorious  This was the opinion of  Vanini  who affirmed that  every hour was lost which was not spent in love  His accusers were unable to comprehend his meaning and the poor advocate for love was burned in flames alas no way metaphorical But whatever advantages the individual may reap from this passion society will certainly be refined and improved by its introduction all laws calculated to discourage it tend to embrute the species and weaken the state Though it cannot plant morals in the human breast it cultivates them when there pity generosity and honour receive a brighter polish from its assistance and a single amour is sufficient entirely to brush off the clown  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  The same efforts that are used in some places to suppress pity and other natural passions may have been employed to extinguish love No nation however unpolished is remarkable for innocence that is not famous for that passion it has flourished in the coldest as well as the warmest regions Even in the sultry wilds of  Southern America  the lover is not satisfied with possessing his mistress's person without having her mind  In all my  Enna  's beauties blest  Amidst profusion still I pine  For tho' she gives me up her breast  Its panting tenant is not mine  Translation of a  SouthAmerican  Ode    But the effects of love are too violent to be the result of an artificial passion nor is it in the power of fashion to force the constitution into those changes which we every day observe Several have died of it Few lovers are unacquainted with the fate of the two  Italian  lovers  Da Corsin  and  Julia Bellamano  who after a long separation expired with pleasure in each other's arms Such instances are too strong confirmations of the reality of the passion and serve to shew that suppressing it is but opposing the natural dictates of the heart  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  ERROR  FOR the first time the very best may err art may persuade and novelty spread out its charm The first fault is the child of Simplicity but every other the offspring of Guilt  VIC OF WAKEFIELD v p  VIRTUE  IN a polished society that man though in rags who has the power of enforcing virtue from the press is of more real use than forty stupid brachmans or bonzes or guebres though they preached never so often never so loud or never so long That man though in rags who is capable of deceiving even indolence into wisdom and who professes amusement while he aims at reformation is more useful in refined society than twenty cardinals  with all their scarlet and tricked out in all the fopperies of scholastic finery  IBID v p  OSTENTATION  INSTEAD of regarding the great with envy I generally consider them with some share of compassion I look upon them as a set of goodnatured misguided people who are indebted to us and not to themselves for all the happiness they enjoy For our pleasure and not their own they sweat under a cumberous heap of finery for our pleasure the lacquied train the slow parading pageant with all the gravity of grandeur moves in review a single coat or a single footman answers all the purposes of the most indolent refinement as well and those who have twenty may be said to keep one for their own pleasure and the other nineteen merely for ours So true is the observation of  Confucius That we take greater pains to persuade others that we are happy than in endeavouring to think so ourselves  IBID v p  PLEASURE  THE enthusiasm of pleasure charms only by intervals The highest rapture lasts only for a moment and all the senses seem so combined as to be soon tired into languor by the gratification of any one of them It is only among the Poets  we hear of men changing to one delight when satiated with another In nature it is very different the glutton when sated with the full meal is unqualified to feel the real pleasure of drinking the drunkard in turn finds few of those transports which lovers boast in enjoyment and the lover when cloyed finds a diminution of every other appetite Thus after a full indulgence of any one sense the man of pleasure finds a languor in all is placed in a chasm between past and expected enjoyment perceives an interval which must be filled up The present can give no satisfaction because he has already robbed it of every charm A mind thus left without immediate employment naturally recurs to the past or the future the reflector finds that he was happy and knows that he cannot be so now he sees that he may yet be happy and wishes the hour was come thus every period of his continuance is miserable except that very short one of immediate gratification Instead of a life of dissipation none has more frequent conversations with disagreeable  self  than he his enthusiasms are but few and transient his appetites like angry creditors continually making fruitless demands for what he is unable to pay and the greater his former pleasure the more strong his regret the more impatient his expectations A life of pleasure is therefore the most unpleasing life in the world  Habit has rendered the man of business more cool in his desires he finds less regret for past pleasures and less solicitude for those to come The life he now leads though tainted in some measure with hope is yet not afflicted so strongly with regret and is less divided between shortlived rapture and lasting anguish The pleasures he has enjoyed are not so vivid and those he has to expect cannot consequently create so much anxiety  The philosopher who extends his regard to all mankind must have still a smaller concern for what has already affected or may hereafter affect himself the concerns of others make his whole study and that study is his pleasure and this pleasure is continuing in its nature because it can be changed at will leaving but few of these anxious intervals which are employed in remembrance or anticipation The philosopher by this means leads a life of almost continued dissipation and reflection which makes the uneasiness and misery of others serves as a companion and instructor to him  In a word positive happiness is constitutional and incapable of increase misery is artificial and generally proceeds from our folly Philosophy can add to our happiness in no other manner but by diminishing our misery it should not pretend to increase our present stock but make us oeconomists  of what we are possessed of The great source of calamity lies in regret or anticipation he therefore is most wise who thinks of the present alone regardless of the past or the future This is impossible to the man of pleasure it is difficult to the man of business and is in some measure attainable by the philosopher Happy were we all born philosophers all born with a talent of thus dissipating our own cares by spreading them upon all mankind  IBID v p  STUDY  HE who has begun his fortune by study will certainly confirm it by perseverance The love of books damps the passion for pleasure and when this passion is once extinguished life is then cheaply supported thus a man being possessed of more than he wants can never be subject to great disappointments and avoids all those meannesses which indigence sometimes unavoidably produces  IBID v p  PLEASURES OF STUDY  THERE is unspeakable pleasure attending the life of a voluntary student The first time I read an excellent book it is to me just as if I had gained a new friend When I read over a book I have perused before it resembles the meeting with an old one We ought to lay hold of every  incident in life for improvement the trifling as well as the important It is not one diamond alone which gives lustre to another a common coarse stone is also employed for that purpose Thus I ought to draw advantage from the insults and contempt I meet with from a worthless fellow His brutality ought to induce me to selfexamination and correct every blemish that may have given rise to his calumny  IBID v p  EARLY DISTASTE TO STUDY NOT TO BE CONQUERED  WITH all the pleasures and profits which are generally produced by learning parents often find it difficult to induce their children to study They often seem dragged to what wears the appearance of application Thus being dilatory in the beginning all future hopes of eminence are entirely cut off If they find themselves obliged to write two lines more polite than ordinary their pen then seems as heavy as a millstone and they spend ten years in turning two or three periods with propriety  These persons are most at a loss when a banquet is almost over the plate and the dice go round that the number of little verses which each is obliged to repeat may be determined by chance The booby when it comes to his turn appears  quite stupid and insensible The company divert themselves with his confusion and sneers winks and whispers are circulated at his expence As for him he opens a pair of large heavy eyes stares at all about him and even offers to join in the laugh without ever considering himself as the burthen of all their goodhumour  IBID p  GRACE  IF you would find the Goddess of Grace seek her not under one form for she assumes a thousand Ever changing under the eye of inspection her variety rather than her figure is pleasing In contemplating her beauty the eye glides over every perfection with giddy delight and capable of fixing no where is charmed with the whole She is now Contemplation with solemn look again Compassion with humid eye she now sparkles with joy soon every feature speaks distress her looks at times invite our approach at others repress our presumption the Goddess cannot be properly called beautiful under any one of these forms but by combining them all she becomes irresistibly pleasing  IBID p  PENITENCE  THE kindness of Heaven is promised to the penitent Heaven we are assured is much more  pleased to view a repentant sinner than many persons who have supported a course of undeviating rectitude And this is right for the single effort by which we stop short in the downhill path to perdition is itself a greater exertion of virtue than an hundred acts of justice  VIC OF WAKEFIELD v p  EARNEST EMPLOYMENT  EARNEST employment if it cannot cure at least will palliate every anxiety  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  THE MERCHANT's CLERK  IT is usually said by grammarians that the use of language is to express our wants and desires but men who know the world hold and I think with some shew of reason that he who best knows how to keep his necessities private is the most likely person to have them redressed and that the true use of speech is not so much to express our wants as to conceal them  When we reflect on the manner in which mankind generally confer their favours there appears something so attractive in riches that the large heap generally collects from the smaller and the poor find as much pleasure in increasing the enormous  mass of the rich as the miser who owns it sees happiness in its increase Nor is there in this any thing repugnant to the laws of morality  Seneca  himself allows that in conferring benefits the present should always be suited to the dignity of the receiver Thus the rich receive large presents and are thanked for accepting them Men of middling stations are obliged to be content with presents something less while the beggar who may be truly said to want indeed is well paid if a farthing rewards his warmest solicitations  Every man who has seen the world and has had his ups and downs in life as the expression is must have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine and must know that to have much or to seem to have it is the only way to have more  Ovid  finely compares a man of broken fortune to a falling column the lower it sinks the greater is that weight it is obliged to sustain Thus when a man's circumstances are such that he has no occasion to borrow he finds numbers willing to lend him but should his wants be such that he sues for a trifle it is two to one whether he may be trusted with the smallest sum A certain young fellow whom I knew whenever he had occasion to ask his friend for a guinea used to prelude his request as if he wanted two hundred and talked so familiarly of large sums that none could ever think he wanted a small one The  same gentleman whenever he wanted credit for a suit of clothes always made the proposal in a laced coat for he found by experience that if he appeared shabby on these occasions his tailor had taken an oath against trusting or what was every whit as bad his foreman was out of the way and should not be at home for some time  There can be no inducements to reveal our wants except to find pity and by this means relief but before a poor man opens his mind in such circumstances he should first consider whether he is contented to lose the esteem of the person he solicits and whether he is willing to give up friendship to excite compassion Pity and Friendship are passions incompatible with each other and it is impossible that both can reside in any breast for the smallest space without impairing each other Friendship is made up of esteem and pleasure Pity is composed of sorrow and contempt the mind may for some time fluctuate between them but it can never entertain both at once  In fact Pity though it may often relieve is but at best a shortlived passion and seldom affords distress more than a transitory assistance with some it scarce lasts from the first impulse till the hand can be put into the pocket with others it may continue for twice that space and on some of extraordinary sensibility I have seen it operate  for half an hour together but still last as it may it generally produces but beggarly effects and where from this motive we give five farthings from others we give pounds Whatever be our feelings from the first impulse of distress when the same distress solicits a second we then feel with diminished sensibility and like the repetition of an echo every stroke becomes weaker 'till at last our sensations lose all mixture of sorrow and degenerate into downright contempt  These speculations bring to my mind the fate of a very goodnatured fellow who is now no more He was bred in a comptinghouse and his father dying just as he was out of his time left him an handsome fortune and many friends to advise with The restraint in which my friend had been brought up had thrown a gloom upon his temper which some regarded as prudence and from such considerations he had every day repeated offers of friendship Such as had money were ready to offer him their assistance that way and they who had daughters frequently in the warmth of affection advised him to marry My friend however was in good circumstances he wanted neither money friends nor a wife and therefore modestly declined their proposals  Some errors however in the management of his affairs and several losses in trade soon brought him to a different way of thinking and he at  last considered that it was his best way to let his friends know that their offers were at length acceptable His first address was to a  A few lines here are borrowed with a slight alteration from the Man of the World p    of this Vol  scrivener who had formerly made him frequent offers of money and friendship at a time when perhaps he knew those offers would have been refused As a man therefore confident of not being refused he requested the use of a hundred guineas for a few days as he just then had occasion for money  "And pray Sir replied the scrivener "do you want all this money"  "Want it Sir" says the other If I did not want it I should not have asked it"  "I am sorry for that" says the friend for those who want money when they borrow will always want money when they should come to pay To say the truth Sir money is money now and I believe it is all sunk in the bottom of the sea for my part he that has got a little is a fool if he does not keep what he has got"  Not quite disconcerted by this refusal our adventurer was resolved to apply to another who he knew was the very best friend he had in the world The gentleman whom he now addressed received his proposal with all the affability that could be expected from generous friendship  "Let me seeyou want an hundred guineasand pray dear Jack would not fifty answer"  "If you have but fifty to spare Sir I must be  contented"  "Fifty to spare I do not say that for I believe I have but twenty about me"  "Then I must borrow the other thirty from some other friend"  "And pray" replied the friend would it not be the best way to borrow the whole money from that other friend and then one note will serve for all you knowYou know my dear Sir that you need make no ceremony with me at any time you know I'm your friend and when you chuse a bit of dinner or soYou Tom see the gentleman down You won't forget to dine with us now and then Your very humble servant"  Distressed but not discouraged at this treatment he was at last resolved to find that assistance from love which he could not have from friendship A young lady a distant relation by the mother's side had a fortune in her own hands and as she had already made all the advances that her sex's modesty would permit he made his proposal with confidence He soon however perceived That no bankrupt ever found the fairone kind She had lately fallen deeply in love with another who had more money and the whole neighbourhood thought it would be a match  Every day now began to strip my poor friend of his former finery his clothes flew piece by piece to the pawnbroker's and he seemed at length equipped in the genuine livery of misfortune But  still he thought himself secure from actual necessity the numberless invitations he had received to dine even after his losses were yet unanswered he was therefore now resolved to accent of a dinner because he wanted one and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week without being openly affronted The last place I saw him in was at a reverend divine's He had as he fancied just nicked the time of dinner for he came in as the doth was laying He took a chair without being desired and talked for some time without being attended to He assured the company that nothing procured so good an appetite as a walk in the Park where he had been that morning He went on and praised the figure of the damask tablecloth talked of a feast where he had been the day before but that the venison was overdone but all this procured him no invitation Finding therefore the gentleman of the house insensible to all his fetches he thought proper at last to retire and mend his appetite by a second walk in the Park  You then O ye beggars of my acquaintance whether in rags or lace whether in  Kentstreet  or the  Mall  whether at the  Smyrna  or St  Giles  's might I be permitted to advise as a friend never seem to want the favour which you solicit Apply to every passion but human pity for redress you may find permanent relief from vanity from selfinterest or from avarice but from compassion  never The very eloquence of a poor man is disgusting and that mouth which is opened even by wisdom is seldom expected to close without the horrors of a petition  To ward off the gripe of poverty you must pretend to be a stranger to her and she will at least use you with ceremony If you be caught dining upon a halfpenny porringer of peasesoup and potatoes praise the wholesomeness of your frugal repast you may observe that Dr  Cheyne  has prescribed peasebroth for the gravel hint that you are not one of those who are always making a deity of your belly If again you are obliged to wear flimsy stuff in the midst of winter be the first to remark that stuffs are very much worn at  Paris  or if there be found some irreparable defects in any part of your equipage which cannot be concealed by all the arts of sitting crosslegged coaxing or darning say that neither you nor  Sampson Gideon  were ever very fond of dress If you be a philosopher hint that  Plato  or  Seneca  are the taylors you choose to employ assure the company that man ought to be content with a bare covering since what now is so much his pride was formerly his shame In short however caught never give out but ascribe to the frugality of your disposition what others might be apt to attribute to the narrowness of your circumstances To be poor and to seem poor is a certain method never to rise pride in the great is hateful in the wise  it is ridiculous but beggarly pride is a rational vanity which I have been taught to applaud and excuse  ESSAY p  THE DISABLED SOLDIER  NO observation is more common and at the same time more true than that one half of the world are ignorant how the other half lives The misfortunes of the great are held up to engage our attention are enlarged upon in tones of declamation and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble sufferers the great under the pressure of calamity are conscious of several others sympathizing with their distress and have at once the comfort of admiration and pity  There is nothing magnanimous in bearing misfortunes with fortitude when the whole world is looking on men in such circumstances will act bravely even from motives of vanity but he who in the vale of obscurity can brave adversity who without friends to encourage acquaintances to pity or even without hope to alleviate his misfortunes can behave with tranquillity and indifference is truly great whether peasant or courtier he deserves admiration and should be held up for our imitation and respect  While the slightest inconveniences of the great are magnified into calamities while Tragedy mouths out their sufferings in all the strains of eloquence the miseries of the poor are entirely disregarded and yet some of the lower ranks of people undergo more real hardships in one day than those of a more exalted station suffer in their whole lives It is inconceivable what difficulties the meanest of our common sailors and soldiers endure without murmuring or regret without passionately declaiming against providence or calling their fellows to be gazers on their intrepidity Every day is to them a day of misery and yet they entertain their hard fate without repining  With what indignation do I hear an  Ovid  a  Cicero  or a  Rabutin  complain of their misfortunes and hardships whose greatest calamity was that of being unable to visit a certain spot of earth to which they had foolishly attached an idea of happiness Their distresses were pleasures compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day endure without murmuring They ate drank and slept they had slaves to attend them and were sure of subsistence for life while many of their fellowcreatures are obliged to wander without a friend to comfort or assist them and even without shelter from the severity of the season  I have been led into these reflections from accidentally meeting some days ago a poor fellow  whom I knew when a boy dressed in a sailor's jacket and begging at one of the outlets of the town with a wooden leg I knew him to have been honest and industrious when in the country and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his present situation wherefore after giving him what I thought proper I desired to know the history of his life and misfortunes and the manner in which he was reduced to his present distress The disabled soldier for such he was though dressed in a sailor's habit scratching his head and leaning on his crutch put himself into an attitude to comply with my request and gave me his history as follows  "AS for my misfortune master I can't pretend to have gone through any more than other folks for except the loss of my limb and my being obliged to beg I don't know any reason thank Heaven that I have to complain there is  Bill Tibbs  of our regiment he has lost both his legs and an eye to boot but thank Heaven it is not so bad with me yet  "I was born in  Shropshire  my father was a labourer and died when I was five years old so I was put upon the parish As he had been a wandering sort of a man the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish I belonged or where I was born so they sent me to another parish and that parish sent me to a third I thought in my  heart they kept sending me about so long that they would not let me be born in any parish at all but at last however they fixed me I had some disposition to be a scholar and was resolved at least to know my letters but the master of the workhouse put me to business as soon as I was able to handle a mallet and here I lived an easy kind of life for five years I only wrought ten hours in the day and had my meat and drink provided for my labour It is true I was not suffered to stir out of the house for fear as they said I should run away But what of that I had the liberty of the whole house and the yard before the door and that was enough for me I was then bound out to a farmer where I was up both early and late but I ate and drank well and liked my business well enough till he died when I was obliged to provide for myself so I was resolved to go seek my fortune  "In this manner I went from town to town worked when I could get employment and starved when I could get none when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a justice of peace I spied a hare crossing the path just before me and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my stick at it Well what will you have on't I killed the hare and was bringing it away when the justice himself met me he called me a poacher and a villain and collaring me desired I would give an account of myself I fell upon my knees  begged his worship's pardon and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed seed and generation but though I gave a very true account the justice said I could give no account so I was indicted at the sessions found guilty of being poor and sent up to  London  to  Newgate  in order to be transported as a vagabond  "People may say this and that of being in jail but for my part I found  Newgate  as agreeable a place as ever I was in in all my life I had my belly full to eat and drink and did no work at all This kind of life was too good to last for ever so I was taken out of prison after five months put on board a ship and sent off with two hundred more to the plantations We had but an indifferent passage for being all confined in the hold more than a hundred of our people died for want of sweet air and those that remain+ed were sickly enough God knows When we came ashore we were sold to the planters and I was bound for seven years more As I was no scholar for I did not know my letters I was obliged to work among the negroes and I served out my time as in duty bound to do  "When my time was expired I worked my passage home and glad I was to see  Old England  again because I loved my country I was afraid however that I should be indicted for a vagabond once more so did not much care to go down into  the country but kept about the town and did little jobs when I could get them  "I was very happy in this manner for some time till one evening coming home from work two men knocked me down and then desired me to stand They belonged to a pressgang I was carried before the justice and as I could give no account of myself I had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war or list for a soldier I chose the latter and in this post of a gentleman I served two campaigns in  Flanders  was at the battles of  Val  and  Fontency  and received but one wound through the breast here but the doctor of our regiment soon made me well again  "When the peace came on I was discharged and as I could not work because my wound was sometimes troublesome I listed for a landman in the  EastIndia  company's service I have fought the  French  in six pitched battles and I verily believe that if I could read or write our Captain would have made me a corporal But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion for I soon fell sick and so got leave to return home again with forty pounds in my pocket This was at the beginning of the present war and I hoped to be set on shore and to have the pleasure of spending my money but the government wanted men and so I was pressed for a sailor before ever I could set foot on shore  "The boatswain found as he said an obstinate fellow he swore he knew that I understood my business well but that I shammed  Abraham  to be idle but God knows I knew nothing of seabusiness and he beat me without considering what he was about I had still however my forty pounds and that was some comfort to me under every beating and the money I might have had to this day but that our ship was taken by the French and so I lost all  "Our crew was carried into  Brest  and many of them died because they were not used to live in jail but for my part it was nothing to me for I was seasoned One night as I was asleep on my bed of boards with a warm blanket about me for I always loved to lie well I was awakened by the boatswain who had a dark lantern in his hand  "  Jack  says he to me will you knock out the  French  centry's brains"  "I don't care says I striving to keep myself awake if I lend a hand"  "Then follow me" says he "and I hope we shall do business"  So up I got and tied my blanket which was all the clothes I had about my middle and went with him to fight the  Frenchman  I hate the  French  because they are all slaves and wear wooden shoes  "Though we had no arms one  Englishman  is able to beat five  French  at any time so we went down to the door where both the centries were  posted and rushing upon them seized their arms in a moment and knocked them down From thence nine of us ran together to the quay and seizing the first boat we met got out of the harbour and put to sea We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the  Dorset  privateer who were glad of so many good hands and we consented to run our chance However we had not as much luck as we expected In three days we fell in with the  Pompadour  privateer of forty guns while we had but twentythree so to it we went yardarm and yardarm The fight lasted for three hours and I verily believe we should have taken the  Frenchman  had we but had some more men left behind but unfortunately we lost all our men just as we were going to get the victory  "I was once more in the power of the  French  and I believe it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to  Brest  but by good fortune we were retaken by the Viper I had almost forgot to tell you that in that engagement I was wounded in two places I lost four fingers off the left hand and my leg was shot off If I had had the good fortune to have lost my leg and use of my hand on board a king's ship and not aboard a privateer I should have been intitled to clothing and maintenance during the rest of my life but that was not my chance one man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth and another  with a wooden ladle However blessed be God I enjoy good health and will for ever love liberty and Old England Liberty property and Old England for ever huzza  Thus saying he limped off leaving me in admiration at his intrepidity and content nor could I avoid acknowledging that an habitual acquaintance with misery serves better than philosophy to teach us to despise it  ESSAY  REPOSE  MEN complain of not finding a place of repose They are in the wrong they have it for seeking What they should indeed complain of is that the heart is an enemy to what they seek To themselves alone should they impute their discontent They seek within the short span of life to satisfy a thousand desires each of which alone is unsatiable One month passes and another comes on the year ends and then begins but man is still unchanging in folly still blindly continuing in prejudice To the wise man every climate and every soil is pleasing to such a man the melody of birds is more ravishing than the harmony of a full concert and the tincture of the cloud preferable to the touch of the finest pencil  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  CONSCIENCE  THE pain which conscience gives the man who has already done wrong is soon got over Conscience is a coward and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent it seldom has justice enough to accuse  VIC OF WAKEFIELD v p  LOVE AMBITION AND AVARICE  DISAPPOINTED love makes the misery of youth disappointed ambition that of manhood and successful avarice that of age These three attack us through life and it is our duty to stand upon our guard To love we ought to oppose dissipation and endeavour to change the object of the affections to ambition the happiness of indolence and obscurity and to avarice the fear of soon dying These are the shields with which we should arm ourselves and thus make every scene of life if not pleasing at least supportable  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  THE PHILOSOPHIC COBLER  THOUGH not very fond of seeing a pageant myself yet I am generally pleased with being in the crowd which sees it it is amusing to observe  the effect which such a spectacle has upon the variety of faces the pleasure it excites in some the envy in others and the wishes it raises in all With this design I lately went to see the entry of a foreign ambassador resolved to make one in the mob to shout as they shouted to fix with earnestness upon the same frivolous objects and participate for a while the pleasures and the wishes of the vulgar  Struggling here for some time in order to be first to see the cavalcade as it passed some one of the crowd unluckily happened to tread upon my shoe and tore it in such a manner that I was utterly unqualified to march forward with the main body and obliged to fall back in the rear Thus rendered incapable of being a spectator of the shew myself I was at least willing to observe the spectators and limped behind like one of the invalids which follow the march of an army  In this plight as I was considering the eagerness that appeared on every face how some bustled to get foremost and others contented themselves with taking a transient peep when they could how some praised the four black servants that were stuck behind one of the equipages and some the ribbons that decorated the horses' necks in another my attention was called off to an object more extraordinary than any that I had yet seen A poor Cobler sat in his stall by the wayside and  continued to work while the crowd passed by without testifying the smallest share of curiosity I own his want of attention excited mine and as I stood in need of his assistance I thought it best to employ a Philosophic Cobler on this occasion perceiving my business therefore he desired me to enter and sit down took my shoe in his lap and began to mend it with his usual indifference and taciturnity  "How my friend" said I to him can you continue to work while all those fine things are passing by your door"  "Very fine they are master returned the cobler for those that like them to be sure but what are all those fine things to me You don't know what it is to be a cobler and so much the better for yourself Your bread is baked you may go and see sights the whole day and eat a warm supper when you come home at night but for me if I should run hunting after all these fine folk what should I get by my journey but an appetite and God help me I have too much of that at home already without stirring out for it Your people who may eat four meals a day and supper at night are but a bad example to such a one as I No master as God has called me into this world in order to mend old shoes I have no business with fine folk and they no business with me"  I here interrupted him with a smile  "See this last master" continues he and this hammer this last and hammer  are the two best friends I have in this world nobody else will be my friend because I want a friend The great folks you saw pass by just now have five hundred friends because they have no occasion for them Now while I stick to my good friends here I am very contented but when I ever so little run after sights and fine things I begin to hate my work I grow sad and have no heart to mend shoes any longer"  This discourse only served to raise my curiosity to know more of a man whom Nature had thus formed into a Philosopher I therefore insensibly led him into an history of his adventures  "I have lived said he a wandering life now fiveandfifty years here today and gone tomorrow for it was my misfortune when I was young to be fond of changing"  "You have been a traveller then I presume"  interrupted I  "I can't boast much of travelling" continued he for I have never left the parish in which I was born but three times in my life that I can remember but then there is not a street in the whole neighbourhood that I have not lived in at some time or another When I began to settle and to take to my business in one street some unforeseen misfortune or a desire of trying my luck elsewhere has removed me perhaps a whole mile away from my former customers while some more lucky cobler would come into my place and make a  handsome fortune among friends of my making there was one who actually died in a stall that I had left worth seven pounds seven shillings all in hard gold which he had quilted into the waistband of his breeches"  I could not but smile at these migrations of a man by the fireside and continued to ask if he had ever been married  "Ay that I have master replied he for sixteen long years and a weary life I had of it Heaven knows My wife took it into her head that the only way to thrive in this world was to save money so though our comingsin was but about three shillings a week all that ever she could lay her hands upon she used to hide away from me though we were obliged to starve the whole week for it"  "The first three years we used to quarrel about this every day and I always got the better but she had a hard spirit and still continued to hide as usual so that I was at last tired of quarrelling and getting the better and she scraped and scraped at pleasure 'till I was almost starved to death Her conduct drove me at last in despair to the alehouse here I used to sit with people who hated home like myself drank while I had money left and run in score while any body would trust me 'till at last the landlady coming one day with a long bill when I was from home and putting it into my wife's hands  the length of it effectually broke her heart I searched the whole stall after she was dead for money but she had hidden it so effectually that with all my pains I could never find a farthing"  By this time my shoe was mended and satisfying the poor artist for his trouble and rewarding him besides for his information I took my leave and returned home to lengthen out the amusement his conversation afforded by communicating it to my friend  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  CHARITY OF THE  ENGLISH  WHILE I sometimes lament the cause of humanity and the depravity of human nature there now and then appear gleams of greatness that serve to relieve the eye oppressed with the hideous prospect and resemble those cultivated spots that are sometimes found in the midst of an Asiatic wilderness I see many superior excellencies among the  English  which it is not in the power of all their follies to hide I see virtues which in other countries are known only to a few practised here by every rank of people  I know not whether it proceeds from their superior opulence that the  English  are more charitable than the rest of mankind whether by being possessed of all the conveniencies of life themselves they have more leisure to perceive the uneasy  situation of the distressed whatever be the motive they are not only the most charitable of any other nation but most judicious in distinguishing the properest objects of compassion  In other countries the giver is generally influenced by the immediate impulse of pity his generosity is exerted as much to relieve his own uneasy sensations as to comfort the object in distress in  England  benefactions are of a more general nature some men of fortune and universal benevolence propose the proper objects the wants and the merits of the petitioners are canvassed by the people neither passion nor pity find a place in the cool discussion and charity is then only exerted when it has received the approbation of reason  IBID p  THE COMMON  ENGLISH  STRANGERS TO URBANITY WITH REMARKS ON THEIR PROWESS IN DIFFICULTIES  THE poor of every country are but little prone to treat each other with tenderness their own miseries are too apt to engross all their pity and perhaps too they give but little commiseration as they find but little from others But in  England  the poor treat each other upon every occasion with more than savage animosity and as if they were in a state of open war by nature In  China  if two porters should meet in a narrow  street they would lay down their burthens make a thousand excuses to each other for the accidental interruption and beg pardon on their knees If two men of the same occupation should meet here they would first begin to scold and at last to beat each other One would think they had miseries enough resulting from penury and labour not to increase them by illnature among themselves and subjection to new penalties but such considerations never weigh with them  But to recompense this strange absurdity they are in the main generous brave and enterprising They feel the slightest injuries with a degree of ungoverned impatience but resist the greatest calamities with surprising fortitude Those miseries under which any other people in the world would sink they have often shewed they were capable of enduring if accidently cast upon some desolate coast their perseverance is beyond what any other nation is capable of sustaining if imprisoned for crimes their efforts to escape are greater than among others The peculiar strength of their prisons when compared to those elsewhere argues their hardiness even the strongest prisons I have ever seen in other countries would be very insufficient to confine the untameable spirit of an  Englishman  In short what man dares do in circumstances of danger an  Englishman  will His virtues seem to sleep in the calm and are called out only to combat the kindred storm  IBID v p  TENDERNESS AND GENEROSITY OF  ENGLISH  MISCREANTS  THE greatest eulogy of the  English  is the generosity of their miscreants the tenderness in general of their robbers and highwaymen Perhaps no people can produce instances of the same kind where the desperate mix pity with injustice still shew that they understand a distinction in crimes and even in acts of violence have still some tincture of remaining virtue In every other country robbery and murder go almost always together here it seldom happens except upon illjudged resistance or pursuit The banditti of other countries are unmerciful to a supreme degree the highwayman and robber here are generous at least to the public and pretend even to virtues in their intercourse among each other Taking therefore my opinion of the  English  from the virtues and vices practised among the vulgar they at once present to a stranger all their faults and keep their virtues up only for the enquiring eye of a philosopher  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  INSOLENCE OF THE COMMON  ENGLISH  TO FOREIGNERS  FOREIGNERS are generally shocked at the insolence of the common  English  upon first coming among them they find themselves ridiculed and  insulted in every street they meet with none of those trifling civilities so frequent elsewhere which are instances of mutual goodwill without previous acquaintance they travel through the country either too ignorant or too obstinate to cultivate a closer acquaintance meet every moment something to excite their disgust and return home to characterise this as the region of spleen insolence and illnature In short  England  would be the last place in the world I would travel to by way of amusement but the first for instruction I would chuse to have others for my acquaintance but  Englishmen  for my friends  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  HAPPINESS EVER REPUGNANT TO OUR WISHES  THE mind is ever ingenious in making its own distress The wandering beggar who has none to protect to feed or to shelter him fancies complete happiness in labour and a full meal Take him from rags and want feed clothe and employ him his wishes now rise one step above his station he could be happy were he possessed of raiment food and ease Suppose his wishes gratified even in these his prospects widen as he ascends he finds himself in affluence and tranquillity indeed but indolence soon breeds anxiety and he desires not only to be freed from pain but to be possessed of pleasure pleasure is granted him and this but opens his soul to ambition and ambition will  be sure to taint his future happiness either with jealousy disappointment or fatigue  But of all the arts of distress found out by man for his own torment perhaps that of philosophic misery is most truly ridiculous a passion no where carried to so extravagant an excess as in the  England  country where I now reside It is not enough to engage all the compassion of a philosopher here that his own globe is harrassed with wars pestilence or barbarity he shall grieve for the inhabitants of the moon if the situation of her imaginary mountains happens to alter and dread the extinction of the sun if the spots on his surface happen to increase One should imagine that philosophy was introduced to make men happy but here it serves to make hundreds miserable  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  LEGISLATIVE POWER  IT were highly to be wished that legislative power would direct the law rather to reformation than severity that it would appear convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making punishments familiar but formidable Instead of our present prisons which find or make men guilty which inclose wretches for the commission of one crime and return them if returned alive fitted for the perpetration of thousands it were to be wished we had as in other parts of  Europe  places of penitence and solitude where the accused might be attended by such as could give them repentance if guilty or new motives of virtue if innocent And this but not the increasing punishments is the way to mend a state nor can I avoid even questioning the validity of that right which social combinations have assumed of capitally punishing offences of a slight nature In cases of murder their right is obvious as it is the duty of us all from the law of selfdefence to cut off that man who has shewn a disregard for the life of another Against such all nature rises in arms but it is not so against him who steals my property Natural law gives me no right to take away his life as by that the horse he steals is as much his property as mine If then I have any right it must be from a compact made between us that he who deprives the other of his horse shall die But this is a false compact because no man has a right to barter his life no more than to take it away as it is not his own And next the compact is inadequate and would be set aside even in a court of modern equity as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience since it is far better that two men should live than that one man should ride But a compact that is false between two men is equally so between an hundred or an hundred thousand for as ten millions of circles can never make a square so the united voice of myriads cannot lend the smallest foundation to falsehood It is thus that  Reason speaks and untutored Nature says the same thing Savages that are directed nearly by natural law alone are very tender of the lives of each other they seldom shed blood but to retaliate former cruelty  Our  Saxon  ancestors fierce as they were in war had but few executions in times of peace and in all commencing governments that have the print of nature still strong upon them scarce any crime is held capital  It is among the citizens of a refined community that penal laws which are in the hands of the rich are laid upon the poor Government while it grows older seems to acquire the moroseness of age and as if our possessions were become dearer in proportion as they increased as if the more enormous our wealth the more extensive our fears our possessions are paled with new edicts every day and hung round with gibbets to scare every invader  Whether is it from the number of our penal laws or the licentiousness of our people that this country should shew more convicts in a year than half the dominions of Europe united Perhaps it is owing to both for they mutually produce each other When by indiscriminate penal laws a nation beholds the same punishment affixed to dissimilar degrees of guilt from perceiving no distinction  in the penalty the people are led to lose all sense of distinction in the crime and this distinction is the bulwark of all morality thus the multitude of laws produce new vices and new vices call for fresh restraints  It were to be wished then that power instead of contriving new laws to punish vice instead of drawing hard the cords of society till a convulsion come to burst them instead of cutting away wretches as useless before we have tried their utility instead of converting correction into vengeance it were to be wished that we tried the restrictive arts of government and made law the protector but not the tyrant of the people We should then find that creatures whose souls are held as dross only wanted the hand of a refiner we should then find that wretches now stuck up for long tortures lest luxury should feel a momentary pang might if properly treated serve to sinew the state in times of danger that as their faces are like ours their hearts are so too that few minds are so base as that perseverance cannot amend that a man may see his last crime without dying for it and that very little blood will serve to cement our security  VIC OF WAKEFIELD v p  OBSERVATIONS ON DEATH  DEATH is not that terrible thing which we suppose it to be it is a spectre which frights us at a distance but which disappears when we come to approach it more closely Our ideas of its terrors are conceived in prejudice and dressed up by fancy we regard it not only as the greatest misfortune but also as an evil accompanied with the most excruciating tortures we have even increased our apprehensions by reasoning on the extent of our sufferings It must be dreadful say some since it is sufficient to separate the soul from the body it must be long since our sufferings are proportioned to the succession of our ideas and these being painful must succeed each other with extreme rapidity In this manner has false philosophy laboured to augment the miseries of our nature and to aggravate that period which nature has kindly covered with insensibility Neither the mind nor the body can suffer these calamities the mind is at that time mostly without ideas and the body too much enfeebled to be capable of perceiving its pain A very acute pain produces either death or fainting which is a state similar to death the body can suffer but to a certain degree if the torture becomes excessive it destroys itself and the mind ceases to perceive when the body can no longer endure  In this manner excessive pain admits of no reflection and wherever there are any signs of it we may be sure that the sufferings of the patient are no greater than what we ourselves may have remembered to endure  But in the article of death we have many instances in which the dying person has shewn that very reflection which presupposes an absence of the greatest pain and consequently that pang which ends life cannot even be so great as those which have preceded Thus when  Charles  XII was shot at the siege of  Frederickshall  he was seen to clap his hand on the hilt of his sword and although the blow was great enough to terminate one of the boldest and bravest lives in the world yet it was not painful enough to destroy reflection He perceived himself attacked he reflected that he ought to defend himself and his body obeyed the impulse of his mind even in the last extremity Thus it is the prejudice of persons in health and not the body in pain that makes us suffer from the approach of death we have all our lives contracted an habit of making out excessive pleasures and pains and nothing but repeated experience shews us how seldom the one can be suffered or the other enjoyed to the utmost If there be any thing necessary to confirm what we have said concerning the gradual cessation of life or the insensible approaches of our end nothing can more effectually prove it  than the uncertainty of the signs of death If we consult what  Winslow  or  Bruhier  have said upon this subject we shall be convinced that between life and death the shade is so very undistinguishable that even all the powers of art can scarcely determine where the one ends and the other begins The colour of the visage the warmth of the body the suppleness of the joints are but uncertain signs of life still subsisting while on the contrary the paleness of the complexion the coldness of the body the stiffness of the extremities the cessation of all motion and the total insensibility of the parts are but uncertain marks of death begun In the same manner also with regard to the pulse and the breathing these motions are often so kept under that it is impossible to perceive them By approaching a lookingglass to the mouth of the person supposed to be dead people often expect to find whether he breathes or not but this is a very uncertain experiment the glass is frequently sullied by the vapour of the dead man's body and often the person is still alive although the glass is no way tarnished In the same manner neither burning nor scarifying neither noises in the ears nor pungent spirits applied to the nostrils give certain signs of the discontinuance of life and there are many instances of persons who have endured them all and afterwards recovered without any external assistance to the astonishment of the spectators How careful therefore should we be before we commit  those who are dearest to us to the grave to be well assured of their departureExperience justice humanity all persuade us not to hasten the funerals of our friends but to keep their bodies unburied until we have certain signs of their real decease  HIST OF ANIMALS p  GRATIFIED AMBITION  GRATIFIED ambition or irreparable calamity may produce transient sensations of pleasure or distress Those storms may discompose in proportion as they are strong or the mind is pliant to their impression But the soul though at first listed up by the event is every day operated upon with diminished influence and at length subsides into the level of its usual tranquillity  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  SCIENTIFIC REFINEMENT  PHILOSOPHERS who have testified such surprise at the want of curiosity in the ignorant seem not to consider that they are usually employed in making provisions of a more important nature in providing rather for the necessities than the amusements of life It is not 'till our more pressing wants are sufficiently supplied that we can attend to the calls of curiosity so that in every age scientific refinement has been the latest effort of human industry  HIST OF THE EARTH p  FOLLIES OF THE WISE  THERE is something satisfactory in accounts of the follies of the wise they give a natural air to the picture and reconcile us to our own  LIFE OF PARNELL p  THE STROLLING PLAYER  I AM fond of amusement in whatever company it is to be found and wit though dressed in rags is ever pleasing to me I went some days ago to take a walk in  St James's Park  about the hour in which company leave it to go to dinner There were but few in the walks and those who staid seemed by their locks rather more willing to forget that they had an appetite than gain one I sat down on one of the benches at the other end of which was seated a man in very shabby clothes  We continued to groan to hem and to cough as usual upon such occasions and at last ventured upon conversation  "I beg pardon Sir" cried I "but I think I have seen you before your face is familiar to me"  "Yes Sir" replied he "I have a good familiar face as my friends tell me I am as well known in every town in  England  as the dromedary or live crocodile  You must understand Sir that I have been these sixteen years  Merry Andrew  to a puppetshow last  Bartholomew  fair my master and I quarrelled beat each other and parted he to sell his puppets to the pincushionmakers in  Rosemarylane  and I to starve in  St James's Park  "  "I am sorry Sir that a person of your appearance should labour under any difficulties"  "O Sir" returned he "my appearance is very much at your service but though I cannot boast of eating much yet there are few that are merrier if I had twenty thousand a year I should be very merry and thank the Fates though not worth a groat I am very merry still If I have threepence in my pocket I never refuse to be my threehalfpence and if I have no money I never scorn to be treated by any that are kind enough to pay my reckoning What think you Sir of a steak and a tankard You shall treat me now and I will treat you again when I find you in the  Park  in love with eating and without money to pay for a dinner"  As I never refuse a small expence for the sake of a merry companion we instantly adjourned to a neighbouring alehouse and in a few moments had a frothing tankard and a smoaking steak spread on the table before us It is impossible to express how much the sight of such good cheer improved my companion's vivacity  "I like this  dinner Sir" says he for three reasons first because I am naturally fond of beef secondly because I am hungry and thirdly and lastly because I get it for nothing no meat eats so sweet as that for which we do not pay"  He therefore now fell to and his appetite seemed to correspond with his inclination After dinner was over he observed that the steak was tough  "and yet Sir" returns he "bad as it was it seemed a rumpsteak to me O the delights of poverty and a good appetite We beggars are the very foundlings of Nature the rich she treats like an errant stepmother they are pleased with nothing cut a steak from what part you will and it is insupportably tough dress it up with pickleseven pickles cannot procure them an appetite But the whole creation is filled with good things for the beggar  Calvert  's butt outtastes champaigne and  Sedgeley  's homebrewed excels tokay Joy joy my blood though our estates lie no where we have fortunes wherever we go If an inundation sweeps away half the grounds of  Cornwall  I am content I have no lands there if the stocks sink that gives me no uneasiness I am no  Jew  "  The fellow's vivacity joined to his poverty I own raised my curiosity to know something of his life and circumstances and I intreated that he would indulge my desire  "That I will Sir"  said he "and welcome only let us drink to prevent our sleeping let us have another tankard while we are awake let us have another tankard for ah how charming a tankard looks when full"  "You must know then that I am very well descended my ancestors have made some noise in the world for my mother cried oysters and my father beat a drum I am told we have even had some trumpeters in our family Many a nobleman cannot shew so respectful a genealogy but that is neither here nor there As I was their only child my father designed to breed me up to his own employment which was that of drummer to a puppetshew Thus the whole employment of my younger years was that of interpreter to  Punch  and King  Solomon  in all his glory But though my father was very fond of instructing me in beating all the marches and points of war I made no very great progress because I naturally had no ear for music so at the age of fifteen I went and listed for a soldier As I had ever hated beating a drum so I soon found that I disliked carrying a musket also neither the one trade nor the other were to my taste for I was by nature fond of being a gentleman besides I was obliged to obey my captain he has his will I have mine and you have yours now I very reasonably concluded that it was much more comfortable for a man to obey his own will than another's  "The life of a soldier soon therefore gave me the spleen I asked leave to quit the service but as I was tall and strong my captain thanked me for my kind intention and said because he had a regard for me we should not part I wrote to my father a very dismal penitent letter and desired that he would raise money to pay for my discharge but the good man was as fond of drinking as I was Sir my service to you and those who are fond of drinking never pay for other people's discharges in short he never answered my letter What could be done If I have not moneys said I to myself to pay for my discharge I must find an equivalent some other way and that must be by running away I deserted and that answered my purpose every bit as well as if I had bought my discharge  "Well I was now fairly rid of my military employment I sold my soldier's clothes bought worse and in order not to be overtaken took the most unfrequented roads possible One evening as I was entering a village I perceived a man whom I afterwards found to be the curate of the parish thrown from his horse in a miry road and almost smothered in the mud He desired my assistance I gave it and drew him out with some difficulty He thanked me for my trouble and was going off but I followed him home for I loved always to have a man thank me at his own door The curate asked an hundred questions as whose son I was from whence I came and whether  I would be faithful I answered him greatly to his satisfaction and gave myself one of the best characters in the world for sobriety Sir I have the honour of drinking your health discretion and fidelity To make a long story short he wanted a servant and hired me With him I lived but two months we did not much like each other I was fond of eating and he gave me but little to eat I loved a pretty girl and the old woman my fellowservant was illnatured and ugly As they endeavoured to starve me between them I made a pious resolution to prevent their committing murder I stole the eggs as soon as they were laid I emptied every unfinished bottle that I could lay my hands on whatever eatable came in my way was sure to disappear in short they found I would not do so I was discharged one morning and paid three shillings and sixpence for two months wages  "While my money was getting ready I employed myself in making preparations for my departure two hens were hatching in an outhouse I went and habitually took the eggs and not to separate the parents from the children I lodged hens and all in my knapsack After this piece of frugality I returned to receive my money and with my knapsack on my back and a staff in my hand I bid adieu with tears in my eyes to my old benefactor I had not gone far from the house when I heard behind me the cry of Stop  thief but this only increased my dispatch it would have been foolish to stop as I knew the voice could not be levelled at me But holdI think I passed those two months at the curate's without drinking Come the times are dry and may this be my poison if ever I spent two more pious stupid months in all my life  "Well after travelling some days whom should I light upon but a company of strolling players The moment I saw them at a distance my heart warmed to them I had a sort of natural love for every thing of the vagabond order they were employed in settling their baggage which had been overturned in a narrow way I offered my assistance which they accepted and we soon became so well acquainted that they took me as a servant This was a paradise to me they sung danced drank eat and travelled all at the same time By the blood of the  Mirabels  I thought I had never lived till then I grew as merry as a grig and laughed at every word that was spoken They liked me as much as I liked them I was a very good figure as you see and though I was poor I was not modest  "I love a straggling life above all things in the world sometimes good sometimes bad to be warm today and cold tomorrow to eat when one can get it and drink when the tankard is out it stands before me We arrived that evening at  Tenterden  and took a large room at the  Greyhound  where we resolved to exhibit  Romeo  and  Juliet  with the funeral procession the grave and the garden scene  Romeo  was to be performed by a gentleman from the TheatreRoyal in  Drurylane Juliet  by a lady who never appeared on any stage before and I was to snuff the candles all excellent in our way We had figures enough but the difficulty was to dress them The same coat that served  Romeo  turned with the blue lining outwards served for his friend  Mercutio  a large piece of crape sufficed at once for  Juliet  's petticoat and pall a pestle and mortar from a neighbouring apothecary's answered all the purposes of a bell and our landlord's own family wrapped in white sheets served to fill up the procession In short there were but three figures among us that might be said to be dressed with any propriety I mean the nurse the starved apothecary and myself Our performance gave universal satisfaction the whole audience were enchanted with our powers and  Tenterden  is a town of taste  "There is one rule by which a strollingplayer may be ever secure of success that is in our theatrical way of expressing it to make a great deal of the character To speak and act as in common life is not playing nor is it what people come to see natural speaking like sweet wine runs glibly over the palate and scarce leaves any taste behind it but being high in a part resembles vinegar  which grates upon the taste and one feels it while he is drinking To please the town or country the way is to cry wring cringe into attitudes mark the emphasis slap the pockets and labour like one in the falling sickness that is the way to work for applause that is the way to gain it  "As we received much reputation for our skill on this first exhibition it was but natural for me to ascribe part of the success to myself I snuffed the candles and let me tell you that without a candlesnuffer the piece would lose half its embellishments In this manner we continued a fortnight and drew tolerable houses but the evening before our intended departure we gave out our very best piece in which all our strength was to be exerted We had great expectations from this and even doubled our prices when behold one of the principal actors fell ill of a violent fever This was a stroke like thunder to our little company they were resolved to go in a body to scold the man for falling sick at so inconvenient a time and that too of a disorder that threatened to be expensive I seized the moment and offered to act the part myself in his stead The case was desperate they accepted my offer and I accordingly sat down with the part in my hand and a tankard before me Sir your health and studied the character which was to be rehearsed the next day and played soon after  "I found my memory excessively helped by drinking I learned my part with astonishing rapidity and bid adieu to snuffing candles ever after I found that Nature had designed me for more noble employments and I was resolved to take her when in the humour We got together in order to rehearse and I informed my companions masters now no longer of the surprising change I felt within me Let the sick man said I be under no uneasiness to get well again I'll fill his place to universal satisfaction he may even die if he thinks proper I'll engage that he shall never be missed I rehearsed before them strutted ranted and received applause They soon gave out that a new actor of eminence was to appear and immediately all the genteel places were bespoke Before I ascended the stage however I concluded within myself that as I brought money to the house I ought to have my share in the profits Gentlemen said I addressing our company I don't pretend to direct you far be it from me to treat you with so much ingratitude you have published my name in the bills with the utmost goodnature and as affairs stand cannot act without me so gentlemen to shew you my gratitude I expect to be paid for my acting as much as any of you otherwise I declare off I'll brandish my snuffers and clip candles as usual This was a very disagreeable proposal but they found that it was impossible to refuse it it was irresistible it was adamant they consented and I  went on in king  Bajazet  My frowning brows bound with a stocking stuffed into a turban while on my captiv'd arms I brandished a jackchain Nature seemed to have fitted me for the part I was tall and had a loud voice my very entrance excited universal applause I looked round on the audience with a smile and made a most low and graceful bow for that is the rule among us As it was a very passionate part I invigorated my spirits with three full glasses the tankard is almost out of brandy By  Alla  it is almost inconceivable how I went through it  Tamerlane  was but a fool to me though he was sometimes loud enough too yet I was still louder than he but then besides I had attitudes in abundance in general I kept my arms folded up thus upon the pit of my stomach it is the way at  DruryLane  and has always a fine effect The tankard would sink to the bottom before I could get through the whole of my merits in short I came off like a prodigy and such was my success that I could ravish the laurels even from a sirloin of beef The principal gentlemen and ladies of the town came to me after the play was over to compliment me upon my success one praised my voice another my person Upon my word says the 'squire's lady he will make one of the finest actors in  Europe  I say it and I think I am something of a judgePraise in the beginning is agreeable enough and we receive it as a favour but when it comes in great quantities we regard  it only as a debt which nothing but our merit could extort instead of thanking them I internally applauded myself We were desired to give our piece a second time we obeyed and I was applauded even more than before  "At last we left the town in order to be at a horserace at some distance from thence I shall never think of  Tenterden  without tears of gratitude and respect The ladies and gentlemen there take my word for it are very good judges of plays and actors Come let us drink their healths if you please Sir We quitted the town I say and there was a wide difference between my coming in and going out I entered the town a candlesnuffer and I quitted it an heroSuch is the world little today and great tomorrow I could say a great deal more upon that subject something truly sublime upon the ups and downs of fortune but it would give us both the spleen and so I shall pass it over  "The races were ended before we arrived at the next town which was no small disappointment to our company however we were resolved to take all we could get I played capital characters there too and came off with my usual brilliancy I sincerely believe I should have been the first actor of  Europe  had my growing merit been properly cultivated but there came an unkindly frost which nipped me in the bud and levelled me  once more down to the common standard of humanity I played Sir  Harry Wildair  all the country ladies were charmed if I but drew out my snuffbox the whole house was in a roar of rapture when I exercised my cudgel I thought they would have fallen into convulsions  There was here a lady who had received an education of nine months in  London  and this gave her pretensions to taste which rendered her the indisputable mistress of the ceremonies wherever she came She was informed of my merits every body praised me yet she refused at first going to see me perform she could not conceive she said any thing but stuff from a stroller talked something in praise of  Garrick  and amazed the ladies with her skill in enunciations tones and cadences She was at last however prevailed upon to go and it was privately intimated to me what a judge was to be present at my next exhibition however no way intimidated I came on in Sir  Harry  one hand stuck in my breeches and the other in my bosom as usual at  DruryLane  but instead of looking at me I perceived the whole audience had their eyes turned upon the lady who had been nine months in  London  from her they expected the decision which was to secure the general's truncheon in my hand or sink me down into a theatrical lettercarrier I opened my snuffbox took snuffthe lady was solemn and so were the rest I broke the cudgel on alderman Smuggler's  backstill gloomy melancholy all the lady groaned and shrugged her shoulders I attempted by laughing myself to excite at least a smilebut the devil a cheek could I perceive wrinkled into sympathy I found it would not do all my goodhumour now became forced my laughter was converted into hysteric grinning and while I pretended spirits my eye shewed the agony of my heart In short the lady came with an intention to be displeased and displeased she was my fame expired I am here andthe tankard is no more"  ESSAY  BEAUTY  A DESIRE of becoming more beautiful than Nature made us is so harmless a vanity that I not only pardon but approve it A desire

CURIOSITY  HUMAN curiosity though at first slowly excited being at last possessed of leisure for indulging its propensity becomes one of the greatest amusements of life and gives higher satisfactions  than what even the senses can afford A man of this disposition turns all nature into a magnificent theatre replete with objects of wonder and surprise and fitted up chiefly for his happiness and entertainment he industriously examines all things from the minutest insect to the most finished animal and when his limited organs can no longer make the disquisition he sends out his imagination

PARNELL p  CONTEMPLATION OF CELESTIAL MAGNIFICENCE  AN use hitherto not much insisted upon that may result from the contemplation of celestial magnificence is that it will teach us to make an

uniformity beauty and precision The heavens present us with a plan which though inexpressibly magnificent is yet regular beyond the power of invention Whenever therefore we  find any apparent defects in the earth which we are about to consider instead of attempting to reason ourselves into an opinion that they are beautiful it will be wise to say that we do not behold them at the proper point of

 LIFE OF PARNNEL p  ASEM  THE MANHATER  WHERE  Tauris  lifts its head above the storm and presents nothing to the sight of the distant traveller but a prospect of nodding rocks falling torrents and all the variety of tremendous nature on the bleak bosom of this frightful mountain secluded from society and detesting the ways of men lived  Asem  the Manhater  Asem  had spent his youth with men had shared in their amusements and had been taught to love his fellowcreatures with the most ardent affection but from the tenderness of his disposition he exhausted all his fortune in relieving the wants of the distressed The petitioner never sued in vain the weary traveller never passed his door he only desisted from doing good when he had no longer the power of relieving  From a fortune thus spent in benevolence he expected a grateful return from those he had formerly relieved and made his application with confidence of redress The ungrateful world soon grew weary of his importunity for pity is but a shortlived passion He soon therefore began to view mankind in a very different light from that in which he had before beheld them he perceived a thousand vices he had never before suspected to exist wherever he turned ingratitude dissimulation and treachery contributed to increase his detestation of them Resolved therefore to continue no longer in a world which he hated and which repaid his detestation with contempt he retired to this region of sterility in order to brood over his resentment in solitude and converse with the only honest heart he knew namely with his own  A cave was his only shelter from the inclemency of the weather fruits gathered with difficulty from the mountain's side his only food and his drink  was fetched with danger and toil from the headlong torrent In this manner he lived sequestered from society passing the hours in meditation and sometimes exulting that he was able to live independently of his fellowcreatures  At the foot of the mountain an extensive lake displayed its glassy bosom reflecting on its broad surface the impending horrors of the mountain To this capacious mirror he would sometimes descend and reclining on its sleep bank cast an eager look on the smooth expanse that lay before him  "How beautiful" he often cried "is nature how lovely even in her wildest scenes How finely contrasted is the level plain that lies beneath me with yon awfull pile that hides its tremendous head in clouds But the beauty of these scenes is no way comparable with their utility from hence an hundred rivers are supplied which distribute health and verdure to the various countries through which they flow Every part of the universe is beautiful just and wise but man vile man is a solecism in nature the only monster in the creation Tempests and whirlwinds have their use but vicious ungrateful man is a blot in the fair page of universal beauty Why was I born of that detested species whose vices are almost a reproach to the wisdom of the divine Creator Were men intirely free from vice all would be uniformity harmony and order A world of moral rectitude should be the result of a perfectly moral agent  Why why then O  Alla  must I be thus confined in darkness doubt and despair"  Just as he uttered the word Despair he was going to plunge into a lake beneath him at once to satisfy his doubts and put a period to his anxiety when he perceived a most majestic being walking on the surface of the water and approaching the bank on which he stood So unexpected an object at once checked his purpose he stopped contemplated and fancied he saw something awful and divine in his aspect  "Son of Adam" cried the Genius "stop thy rash purpose the Father of the Faithful has seen thy justice thy integrity thy miseries and hath sent me to afford and administer relief Give me thine hand and follow without trembling whereever I shall lead in me behold the Genius of Conviction kept by the great prophet to turn from their errors those who go astray not from curiosity but a rectitude of intention Follow me and be wise"  Asem  immediately descended upon the lake and his guide conducted him along the surface of the water 'till coming near the centre of the lake they both began to sink the waters closed over their heads they descended several hundred fathoms 'till  Asem  just ready to give up his life as inevitably lost found himself with his celestial  guide in another world at the bottom of the waters where human foot had never trod before His astonishment was beyond description when he saw a sun like that he had left a serene sky over his head and blooming verdure under his feet  "I plainly perceive your amazement" said the Genius "but suspend it for a while This world was formed by  Alla  at the request and under the inspection of our great prophet who once entertained the same doubts which filled your mind when I found you and from the consequence of which you were so lately rescued The rational inhabitants of this world are formed agreeable to your own ideas they are absolutely without vice In other respects it resembles your earth but differs from it in being wholly inhabited by men who never do wrong If you find this world more agreeable than that you so lately left you have free permission to spend the remainder of your days in it but permit me for some time to attend you that I may silence your doubts and make you better acquainted with your company and your new habitation"  "A world without vice Rational beings without immorality" cried  Asem  in a rapture "I thank thee O  Alla  who hast at length heard my petitions this this indeed will produce happiness extasy and ease O for an immortality to spend it among men who are incapable of ingratitude  injustice fraud violence and a thousand other crimes that render society miserable"  "Cease thine acclamations" replied the Genius "Look around thee reflect on every object and action before us and communicate to me the result of thine observations Lead wherever you think proper I shall be your attendant and instructor"  Asem  and his companion travelled on in silence for some time the former being entirely lost in astonishment but at last recovering his former serenity he could not help observing that the face of the country bore a very near resemblance to that he had left except that this subterranean world still seemed to retain its primaeval wildness  "Here" cried  Asem  "I perceive animals of prey and others that seem only designed for their subsistance it is the very same in the world over our heads But had I been permitted to instruct our prophet I would have removed this defect and formed no voracious or destructive animals which only prey on the other parts of the creation"  "Your tenderness for inferior animals is I find remarkable" said the Genius smiling But with regard to meaner creatures this world exactly resembles the other and indeed for obvious reasons for the earth can support a more considerable number of animals by their thus becoming food for each other than if they had lived  entirely on the vegetable productions so that animals of different natures thus formed instead of lessening their multitude subsist in the greatest number possible But let us hasten on to the inhabited country before us and see what that offers for instruction"  They soon gained the utmost verge of the forest and entered the country inhabited by men without vice and  Asem  anticipated in idea the rational delight he hoped to experience in such an innocent society But they had scarce left the confines of the wood when they beheld one of the inhabitants flying with hasty steps and terror in his countenance from an army of squirrels that closely pursued him  "Heavens" cried  Asem  "why does he fly What can he fear from animals so contemptible"  He had scarce spoke when he perceived two dogs pursuing another of the human species who with equal terror and haste attempted to avoid them  "This" cried  Asem  to his guide "is truly surprising nor can I conceive the reason for so strange an action"  "Every species of animals" replied the Genius "has of late grown very powerful in this country for the inhabitants at first thinking it unjust to use either fraud or force in destroying them they have insensibly increased and now frequently ravage their harmless frontiers"  "But they should have been destroyed" cried  Asem  "you see the consequence of such neglect"  "Where is then that  tenderness you so lately expressed for subordinate animals" replied the Genius smiling "you seem to have forgot that branch of justice"  "I must acknowledge my mistake" returned  Asem  "I am now convinced that we must be guilty of tyranny and injustice to the brute creation if we would enjoy the world ourselves But let us no longer observe the duty of men to these irrational creatures but survey their connexions with one another"  As they walked farther up the country the more he was surprised to see no vestiges of handsome houses no cities nor any mark of elegant design His conductor perceiving his surprise observed That the inhabitants of this new world were perfectly content with their ancient simplicity each had an house which though homely was sufficient to lodge his little family they were too good to build houses which would only increase their own pride and the envy of the spectator what they built was for convenience not for shew  "At least then" said  Asem  "they have neither architects painters or statuaries in their society but these are idle arts and may be spared However before I spend much more time here you should have my thanks for introducing me into the society of some of their wisest men there is scarce any pleasure to me equal to a refined conversation there is nothing of which I am so enamoured as wisdom"  "Wisdom" replied his  instructor "how ridiculous We have no wisdom here for we have no occasion for it true wisdom is only a knowledge of our own duty and the duty of others to us but of what use is such wisdom here Each intuitively performs what is right in himself and expects the same from others If by wisdom you should mean vain curiosity and empty speculation as such pleasures have their origin in vanity luxury or avarice we are too good to pursue them"  "All this may be right" says  Asem  but methinks I observe a solitary disposition prevail among the people each family keeps separately within their own precincts without society or without intercourse"  "That indeed is true" replied the other "here is no established society nor should there be any all societies are made either through fear or friendship the people we are among are too good to fear each other and there are no motives to private friendship where all are equally meritorious"  "Well then" said the sceptic "as I am to spend my time here if I am to have neither the polite arts nor wisdom nor friendship in such a world I should be glad at least of an easy companion who may tell me his thoughts and to whom I may communicate mine"  "And to what purpose should either do this" says the Genius "flattery or curiosity are vicious motives and never allowed here and wisdom is out of the question"  "Still however" said  Asem  "the inhabitants must be happy each is contented with his own possessions nor avariciously endeavours to heap up more than is necessary for his own subsistence each has therefore leisure to pity those that stand in need of his compassion"  He had scarce spoken when his ears were assaulted with the lamentations of a wretch who sat by the wayside and in the most deplorable distress seemed gently to murmur at his own misery  Asem  immediately ran to his relief and found him in the last stage of a consumption  "Strange" cried the son of  Adam  that men who are free from vice should thus suffer so much misery without relief"  "Be not surprised" said the wretch who was dying "would it not be the utmost injustice for beings who have only just sufficient to support themselves and are content with a bare subsistence to take it from their own mouths to put it into mine They never are possessed of a single meal more than is necessary and what is barely necessary cannot be dispensed with"  "They should have been supplied with more than is necessary" cried  Asem  "and yet I contradict my own opinion but a moment before all is doubt perplexity and confusion Even the want of ingratitude is no virtue here since they never received a favour They have however another excellence yet behind the love of their country is still I hope one of their darling virtues"  "Peace  Asem"  replied the guardian with a countenance not less  severe than beautiful "nor forfeit all thy pretensions to wisdom the same selfish motives by which we prefer our own interest to that of others induce us to regard our country preferable to that of another Nothing less than universal benevolence is free from vice and that you see is practised here"  "Strange" cries the disappointed pilgrim in an agony of distress "what sort of a world am I now introduced to There is scarce a single virtue but that of temperance which they practise and in that they are no way superior to the very brute creation There is scarce an amusement which they enjoy fortitude liberality friendship wisdom conversation and love of country all are virtues entirely unknown here thus it seems that to be unacquainted with vice is not to know virtue Take me O my Genius back to that very world which I have despised a world which has  Alla  for its contriver is much more wisely formed than that which has been projected by  Mahomet  Ingratitude contempt and hatred I can now suffer for perhaps I have deserved them When I arraigned the wisdom of Providence I only shewed my own ignorance henceforth let me keep from vice myself and pity it in others"  He had scarce ended when the Genius assuming an air of terrible complacency called all his thunders around him and vanished in a whirlwind  Asem  astonished at the terror of the scene looked for his imaginary world when casting his  eyes around he perceived himself in the very situation and in the very place where he first began to repine and despair his right foot had been just advanced to take the fatal plunge nor had it been yet withdrawn so instantly did Providence strike the truths just imprinted on his soul He now departed from the waterside in tranquillity and leaving his horrid mansion travelled to  Segestan  his native city where he diligently applied himself to commerce and put in practice that wisdom he had learned in solitude The frugality of a few years soon produced opulence the number of his domestics increased his friends came to him from every part of the city nor did he receive them with disdain and a youth of misery was concluded with an oldage of elegance affluence and ease  ESSAY  ENTERTAINMENT IN THE STUDY OF TRIFLES  TO a philosopher no circumstance however trifling is too minute he finds instruction and entertainment in occurrences which are passed over by the rest of mankind as low trite and indifferent it is from the number of these particulars which to many appear insignificant that he is at last enabled to form general conclusions  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  CEREMONY  CEREMONIES are different in every country but true politeness is every where the same Ceremonies which take up so much of our attention are only artificial helps which ignorance assumes in order to imitate politeness which is the result of good sense and goodnature A person possessed of those qualities though he had never seen a court is truly agreeable and if without them would continue a clown though he had been all his life a gentleman usher  How would a  Chinese  bred up in the formalities of an eastern court be regarded should he carry all his good manners beyond the Great Wall How would an  Englishman  skilled in all the decorums of western goodbreeding appear at an eastern entertainnent Would he not be reckoned more fantastically savage than even his unbred footman  Ceremony resembles that base coin which circulates through a country by the royal mandate it serves every purpose of real money at home but is entirely useless if carried abroad a person who should attempt to circulate his native trash in another country would be thought either ridiculous or culpable He is truly wellbred who knows when to value and when to despise those national  peculiarities which are regarded by some with so much observance A traveller of taste at once perceives that the wise are polite all the world over but that fools are polite only at home  IBID v p  LITERARY REPUTATION  EVERY writer is now convinced that he must be chiefly indebted to good fortune for finding readers willing to allow him any degree of reputation It has been remarked that almost every character which has excited either attention or pity has owed part of its success to merit and part to an happy concurrence of circumstances in its favour Had  Caesar  or  Cromwell  exchanged countries the one might have been a serjeant and the other an exciseman So it is with wit which generally succeeds more from being happily addressed than from its native poignancy A jest calculated to spread at a gamingtable may be received with perfect indifference should it happen to drop in a mackarelboat We have all seen dunces triumph in some companies where men of real humour were disregarded by a general combination in favour of stupidity To drive the observation as far as it will go should the labours of a writer who designs his performances for readers of a more refined appetite fall into the hands of a devourer of compilations what can he expect but contempt and confusion If his merits are to  be determined by judges who estimate the value of a book from its bulk or its frontispiece every rival must acquire an easy superiority who with persuasive eloquence promises four extraordinary pages of letterpress or three beautiful prints curiously coloured from nature  ESSAY  ALLUREMENTS OF QUALITY  QUALITY and title have such allurements that hundreds are ready to give up all their own importance to cringe to flatter to look little and to pall every pleasure in constraint merely to be among the great though without the least hopes of improving their understanding or sharing their generosity they might be happy among their equals but those are despised for company where they are despised in turn  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  MAGNIFICENCE OF THE DEITY  THOUGH we see the greatness and wisdom of the Deity in all the seeming worlds that surround us it is our chief concern to trace him in that which we inhabit The examination

absent friend in the hours of mirth and feasting when his company is least wanted shews no slight degree of sincerity  LIFE OF PARNEL p  THE STORY OF  ALCANDER  AND  SEPTIMIUS  TAKEN FROM A BYZANTINE HISTORIAN  ATHENS  long after the decline of the  Roman  empire still continued the seat of learning politeness and wisdom  Theodoric  the  Ostrogoth  repaired the schools which barbarity was suffering to fall into decay and continued those pensions to men of learning which avaricious governors had monopolized  In this city and about this period  Alcander  and  Septimius  were fellow students together the one the most subtle reasoner of all the  Lyceum  the other the most eloquent speaker in the academic grove Mutual admiration soon begot a friendship Their fortunes were nearly equal and they  were natives of the two most celebrated cities in the world for  Alcander  was of  Athens Septimius  came from  Rome  In this state of harmony they lived for some time together when  Alcander  after passing the first part of his youth in the indolence of philosophy thought at length of entering into the busy world and as a step previous to this placed his affections on  Hypatia  a lady of exquisite beauty The day of their intended nuptials was fixed the previous ceremonies were performed and nothing now remained but her being conducted in triumph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom  Alcander  's exultation in his own happiness or being unable to enjoy any satisfaction without making his friend  Septimius  a partner prevailed upon him to introduce  Hypatia  to his fellowstudent which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found himself equally happy in friendship and love But this was an interview fatal to the future peace of both for  Septimius  no sooner saw her but he was smitten with an involuntary passion and though he used every effort to suppress desires at once so imprudent and unjust the emotions of his mind in a short time became so strong that they brought on a fever which the physicians judged incurable  During this illness  Alcander  watched him with all the anxiety of fondness and brought his mistress  to join in those amiable offices of friendship The sagacity of the physicians by these means soon discovered that the cause of their patient's disorder was love  Alcander  being apprised of their discovery at length extorted a confession from the reluctant dying lover  It would but delay the narrative to describe the conflict between love and friendship in the breast of  Alcander  on this occasion it is enough to say that the  Athenians  were at that time arrived at such refinement in morals that every virtue was carried to excess In short forgetful of his own felicity he gave up his intended bride in all her charms to the young  Roman  They were married privately by his connivance and this unlookedfor change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the constitution of the now happy  Septimius  In a few days he was perfectly recovered and set out with his fair partner for  Rome  Here by an exertion of those talents which he was so eminently possessed of  Septimius  in a few years arrived at the highest dignities of the state and was constituted the cityjudge or praetor  In the mean time  Alcander  not only felt the pain of being separated from his friend and his mistress but a prosecution was also commenced against him by the relations of  Hypatia  for having basely given up his bride as was suggested for money His innocence of the crime laid to his charge and even his eloquence in his own defence were not able to  withstand the influence of a powerful party He was cast and condemned to pay an enormous fine However being unable to raise so large a sum at the time appointed his possessions were confiscated he himself was stripped of the habit of freedom exposed as a slave in the marketplace and sold to the highest bidder  A merchant of  Thrace  becoming his purchaser  Alcander  with some other companions of distress was carried into that region of desolation and sterility His stated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious master and his success in hunting was all that was allowed him to supply his precarious subsistence Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil and every change of season served but to aggravate his unsheltered distress After some years of bondage however an opportunity of escaping offered he embraced it with ardour so that travelling by night and lodging in caverns by day to shorten a long story he at last arrived in  Rome  The same day on which  Alcander  arrived  Septimius  sat administering justice in the forum whither our wanderer came expecting to be instantly known and publicly acknowledged by his former friend Here he stood the whole day amongst the crowd watching the eyes of the judge and expecting to be taken notice of but he was so much altered by a long succession of hardships that he continued unnoticed among the rest and in the evening  when he was going up to the praetor's chair he was brutally repulsed by the attending lictors The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another for night coming on he now found himself under a necessity of seeking a place to lie in and yet knew not where to apply All emaciated and in rags as he was none of the citizens would harbour so much wretchedness and sleeping in the streets might be attended with interruption or danger in short he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city the usual retreat of guilt poverty and despair In this mansion of horror laying his head upon an inverted urn he forgot his miseries for a while in sleep and found on his flinty couch more ease than beds of down can supply to the guilty  As he continued here about midnight two robbers came to make this their retreat but happening to disagree about the division of their plunder one of them stabbed the other to the heart and left him weltering in blood at the entrance In these circumstances he was found next morning dead at the mouth of the vault This naturally inducing a further enquiry an alarm was spread the cave was examined and  Alcander  being found was immediately apprehended and accused of robbery and murder The circumstances against him were strong and the wretchedness of his appearance confirmed suspicion Misfortune and he were  now so long acquainted that he at last became regardless of life He detested a world where he had found only ingratitude falsehood and cruelty he was determined to make no defence and thus lowering with resolution he was dragged bound with cords before the tribunal of  Septimius  As the proofs were positive against him and he offered nothing in his own vindication the judge was proceeding to doom him to a most cruel and ignominious death when the attention of the multitude was soon divided by another object The robber who had been really guilty was apprehended selling his plunder and struck with a panic had confessed his crime He was brought bound to the same tribunal and acquitted every other person of any partnership in his guilt  alcander  's innocence therefore appeared but the sullen rashness of his conduct remained a wonder to the surrounding multitude but their astonishment was still further increased when they saw their judge start from his tribunal to embrace the supposed criminal  Septimius  recollected his friend and former benefactor and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy Need the sequel be related  Alcander  was acquitted shared the friendship and honours of the principal citizens of  Rome  lived afterwards in happiness and ease and left it to be engraved on his tomb That no circumstances are so desperate which Providence may not relieve  ESSAY  CONTEMPT OF THE IGNORANT  THERE are some of superior abilities who reverence and esteem each other but then mutual admiration is not sufficient to shield off the contempt of the crowd The wife are but few and they praise with a feeble voice the vulgar are many and roar in reproaches The truly great seldom unite in societies have few meetings no cabals the dunces hunt in full cry till they have run down a reputation and then snarl and fight with each other about dividing the spoil  London  Here you may see the compilers and the bookanswerers of every month when they have cut up some respectable name most frequently reproaching each other with stupidity and dullness resembling the wolves of the  Russian  forest who prey upon venison or horseflesh when they can get it but in cases of necessity lying in wait to devour each other While they have new books to cut up they make a hearty meal but if this resource should unhappily fail then it is that critics eat up critics and compilers rob from compilations  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  PLEASURES OF RURAL RETIREMENT  WHEN I reflect on the unambitious retirement in which I passed the earlier part of my life in the country I cannot avoid feeling some pain  in thinking that those happy days are never to return In that retreat all nature seemed capable of affording pleasure I then made no refinements on happiness but could be pleased with the most aukward efforts of rustic mirth thought crosspurposes the highest stretch of human wit and questions and commands the most rational way of spending the evening Happy could so charming an illusion still continue I find that age and knowledge only contribute to sour our dispositions My present enjoyments may be more refined but they are infinitely less pleasing The pleasure the best actor gives can no way compare to that I have received from a country wag who imitated a Quaker's sermon The music of the finest singer is dissonance to what I felt when our old dairymaid sung me into tears with  Johnny Armstrong  's Last Good Night or the Cruelty of  Barbara Allen  Writers of every age have endeavoured to shew that pleasure is in us and not in the objects offered for our amusement If the soul be happily disposed every thing becomes capable of affording entertainment and distress will almost want a name Every occurrence passes in review like the figures of a procession some may be aukward others illdressed but none but a fool is for this enraged with the master of the ceremonies  I remember to have once seen a slave in a fortification in  Flanders  who appeared no way touched  with his situation He was maimed deformed and chained obliged to toil from the appearance of day till nightfall and condemned to this for life yet with all these circumstances of apparent wretchedness he sang would have danced but that he wanted a leg and appeared the merriest happiest man of all the garrison What a practical philosopher was here An happy constitution supplied philosophy and though seemingly destitute of wisdom he was really wise No reading or study had contributed to disenchant the fairyland around him every thing furnished him with an opportunity of mirth and though some thought him from his insensibility a fool he was such an ideot as philosophers should wish to imitate for all philosophy is only forcing the trade of happiness when nature seems to have denied the means  They who like our slave can place themselves on that side of the world in which every thing appears in a pleasing light will find something in every occurrence to excite their goodhumour The most calamitous events either to themselves or others can bring no new affliction the whole world is to them a theatre on which comedies only are acted All the bustle of heroism or the rants of ambition serve only to heighten the absurdity of the scene and make the humour more poignant They feel in short as little anguish at their own distress or the complaints of others as the undertaker though dressed in black feels sorrow at a funeral  Of all the men I ever read of the famous Cardinal  de Retz  possessed this happiness of temper in the highest degree As he was a man of gallantry and despised all that wore the pedantic appearance of philosophy wherever pleasure was to be sold he was generally foremost to raise the auction Being an universal admirer of the fair sex when he found one lady cruel he generally fell in love with another from whom he expected a more favourable reception if she too rejected his addresses he never thought of retiring into deserts or pining in hopeless distress he persuaded himself that instead of loving the lady he only fancied that he had loved her and so all was well again When Fortune wore her angriest look and he at last fell into the power of his most deadly enemy Cardinal  Mazarine  being confined a close prisoner in the castle of  Valenciennes  he never attempted to support his distress by wisdom or philosophy for he pretented to neither He only laughed at himself and his persecutor and seemed infinitely pleased at his new situation In this mansion of distress though secluded from his friends though denied all the amusements and even the conveniences of life he still retained his goodhumour laughed at all the little spite of his enemies and carried the jest so far as to be revenged by writing the life of his gaoler  All that the wisdom of the proud can teach is to be stubborn or sullen under misfortunes The  Cardinal's example will instruct us to be merry in circumstances of the highest affliction It matters not whether our goodhumour be construed by others into insensibility or even ideotism it is happiness to ourselves and none but a fool would measure his satisfaction by what the world thinks of it For my own part I never pass by one of our prisons for debt that I do not envy that felicity which is still going forward among those people who forget the cares of the world by being shut out from its ambition  The happiest silly fellow I ever knew was of the number of those goodnatured creatures that are said to do no harm to any but themselves Whenever he fell into any misery he usually called it Seeing Life If his head was broke by a chairman or his pocket picked by a sharper he comforted himself by imitating the  Hibernian  dialect of the one or the more fashionable cant of the other Nothing came amiss to him His inattention to money matters had incensed his father to such a degree that all the intercession of friends in his favour was fruitless The old gentleman was on his deathbed The whole family and  Dick  among the number gathered around him  "I leave my second son  Andrew"  said the expiring miser "my whole estate and desire him to be frugal"  Andrew  in a sorrowful tone as is usual on these occasions prayed Heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it himself  "I  recommend  Simon  my third son to the care of his elder brother and leave him beside four thousand pounds"  "Ah father" cried  Simon  in great affliction to be sure "May Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself"  At last turning to poor  Dick  "As for you you have always been a sad dog you'll never come to good you'll never be rich I'll leave you a shilling to buy an halter"  "Ah father" cries  Dick  without any emotion "may Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself"  This was all the trouble the loss of fortune gave this thoughtless imprudent creature However the tenderness of an uncle recompensed the neglect of a father and my friend is now not only excessively goodhumoured but competently rich  Yes let the world cry out at a bankrupt who appears at a ball at an author who laughs at the public which pronounces him a dunce at a general who smiles at the reproach of the vulgar or the lady who keeps her goodhumour in spite of scandal but such is the wisest behaviour that any of us can possibly assume it is certainly a better way to oppose calamity by dissipation than to take up the arms of reason or resolution to oppose it by the first method we forget our miseries by the last we only conceal them from others by struggling with misfortunes we are sure to receive some wounds in the conflict but a sure method to come off victorious is by running away  ESSAY  BENEFITS ARISING FROM LUXURY  THOSE philosophers who declaim against luxury have but little understood its benefits they seem insensible that to luxury we owe not only the greatest part of our knowledge but even or our virtues  It may sound fine in the mouth of a declaimer when he talks of subduing our appetites of teaching every sense to be content with a bare sufficiency and of supplying only the wants of nature but is there not more satisfaction in indulging those appetites if with innocence and safety than in restraining them Am not I better pleased in enjoyment than in the sullen satisfaction of thinking that I can live without enjoyment  The more various our artificial necessities the wider is our circle of pleasure for all pleasure consists in obviating necessities as they rise luxury therefore as it increases our wants increases our capacity for happiness  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  In whatsoever light we consider luxury whether as employing a number of hands naturally too feeble for more laborious employment as finding a variety of occupation for others who might be totally idle or as furnishing out new inlets to happiness without incroaching on mutual property  in whatever light we regard it we shall have reason to stand up in its defence and the sentiment of  Confucius  still remains unshaken  That we should enjoy as many of the luxuries of life as are consistent with our own safety and the prosperity of others and that he who finds out a new pleasure is one of the most useful members of society  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  MODESTY  THERE is not perhaps a more whimsical figure in nature than a man of real modesty who assumes an air of impudence who while his heart beats with anxiety studies ease and affects goodhumour In this situation however every unexperienced writer finds himself Impressed with the terrors of the tribunal before which he is going to appear his natural humour turns to pertness and for real wit he is obliged to substitute vivacity  ESSAY  This Song was communicated to the Public by Mr  Boswell  since the Doctor's death  SONG  Intended for Miss  HARDCASTLE  in the Comedy of  SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER  but as Mrs  Bulkeley  could not sing it was omitted  AH me when shall I

passion discover  She that gives all to the false one pursuing her  Makes but a penitent loses a lover  GENEROSITY  GENEROSITY is the part of a soul raised above the vulgar There is in it something of what we admire in heroes and praise with a degree of rapture  In paying his debts a man barely does his duty and it is an action attended with no sort of glory Should  Lysippus  satisfy his creditors who would be at the pains of telling it to the world Generosity is a virtue of a very different complexion It is raised above duty and from its elevation attracts the attention and the praises of us little mortals below  ESSAY  MISPLACED VIRTUES  AMONG men long conversant with books we too frequently find misplaced virtues We find the studious animated with a strong passion for the great virtues as they are mistakenly called and utterly forgetful of the ordinary ones The declamations of philosophy are generally rather exhausted on those supererogatory duties than on such as are indispensibly necessary A man therefore  who has taken his ideas of mankind from study alone generally comes into the world with an heart melting at every fictitious distress Thus he is induced by misplaced liberality to put himself into the indigent circumstances of the person he relieves  ESSAY  PRIDE OF THE  ENGLISH  THE  English  seem as silent as the  Japanese  yet vainer than the inhabitants of  Siam  Condescend to address them first and you are sure of their acquaintance stoop to flattery and you conciliate their friendship and esteem They bear hunger cold fatigue and all the miseries of life without shrinking danger only calls forth their fortitude they even exult in calamity but contempt is what they cannot bear An  Englishman  fears contempt more than death he often flies to death as a refuge from its pressure and dies when he fancies the world has ceased to esteem him  Pride seems the source not only of their national vices but of their national virtues also An  Englishman  is taught to love his king as his friend but to acknowledge no other master than the laws which himself has contributed to enact He despises those nations who that one may be free are all content to be slaves who first lift a tyrant into terror and then shrink under his power as if delegated from heaven Liberty is echoed in all  their assemblies and thousands might be found ready to offer up their lives for the sound though perhaps not one of all the number understands its meaning The lowest mechanic however looks upon it as his duty to be a watchful guardian of his country's freedom and often uses a language that might seem haughty even in the mouth of the great emperor who traces his ancestry to the moon  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  REPUTATION  THE great are solicitous only of raising their own reputations while the opposite class alas are solicitous of bringing every reputation down to a level with their own  IBID p  PICTURE OF A CRITIC  A CRITIC is often guided by the same motives that direct his author The author endeavours to persuade us that he has written a good book the critic is equally solicitous to shew that he could write a better had he thought proper A critic is a being possessed of all the vanity but not the genius of a scholar incapable from his native weakness of lifting himself from the ground he applies to contiguous merit for support makes the sportive sallies of another's imagination his serious employment pretends to take our feelings under  his care teaches where to condemn where to lay the emphasis of praise and may with as much justice be called a man of taste as the  Chinese  who measures his wisdom by the length of his nails  If then a book spirited or humorous happens to appear in the republic of letters several critics are in waiting to bid the public not to laugh at a single line of it for themselves had read it and they know what is most proper to excite laughter Other critics contradict the fulminations of this tribunal call them all spiders and assure the public that they ought to laugh without restraint Another set are in the mean time quietly employed in writing notes to the book intended to shew the particular passages to be laughed at when these are out others still there are who write notes upon notes Thus a single new book employs not only the papermakers the printers the pressmen the book binders the hawkers but twenty critics and as many compilers In short the body of the learned may be compared to a  Persian  army where there are many pioneers several sutlers numberless servants women and children in abundance and but few soldiers  CIT OF THE WORLD v p  FORTUNE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF LOVE AND AFFECTION AMONG THE MODERNS  THE formalities delays and disappointments that precede a treaty of marriage  England  here are usually as numerous as those previous to a treaty of peace The laws of this country are finely calculated to promote all commerce but the commerce between the sexes Their encouragements for propagating hemp madder and tobacco are indeed admirable Marriages are the only commodity that meets with discouragement  Yet from the vernal softness of the air the verdure of the fields the transparency of the streams and the beauty of the women I know few countries more proper to invite to courtship Here Love might sport among painted lawns and warbling groves and revel amidst gales wafting at once both fragrance and harmony Yet it seems he has forsaken the island and when a couple are now to be married mutual love or an union of minds is the last and most trifling consideration If their goods and chattels can be brought to unite their sympathetic souls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty The gentleman's mortgaged lawn becomes enamoured of the lady's marriageable grove the match is struck up and both parties are piously in loveaccording to act of parliament  Thus they who have fortune are possessed at least of something that is lovely but I actually pity those who have none I am told there was a time when ladies with no other merit but youth virtue and beauty had a chance for husbands at least amongst our clergymen and officers The blush and innocence of sixteen was said to have a powerful influence over these two professions But of late all the little traffic of blushing ogling dimpling and smiling has been forbidden by an act in that case wisely made and provided A lady's whole cargo of smiles sighs and whispers is declared utterly contraband till she arrives in the warm latitude of twentytwo where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay She is then permitted to dimple and smile when the dimples begin to forsake her and when perhaps grown ugly is charitably intrusted with an unlimited use of her charms Her lovers however by this time have forsaken her the captain has changed for another mistress the priest himself leaves her in solitude to bewail her virginity and she dies even without benefit of clergy  Thus you find the  Europeans  discouraging love with as much earnestness as the rudest savage of  Sofala  The Genius is surely now no more In every region there seem enemies in arms to oppress him Avarice in  Europe  jealousy in  Persia  ceremony in  China  poverty among the  Tartars  and lust in  Circassia  are all prepared to oppose  his power The Genius is certainly banished from earth though once adored under such a variety of forms He is no where to be found and all that the ladies of each country can produce are but a few trifling reliques as instances of his former residence and favour  "The Genius of Love" says the Eastern Apologue "had long resided in the happy plains of  Abra  where every breeze was health and every sound produced tranquillity His temple at first was crowded but every age lessened the number of his votaries or cooled their devotion Perceiving therefore his altars at length quite deserted he was resolved to remove to some more propitious region and he apprised the fair sex of every country where he could hope for a proper reception to assert their right to his presence among them In return to this proclamation embassies were sent from the ladies of every part of the world to invite him and to display the superiority of their claims  "And first the beauties of  China  appeared No country could compare with them for modesty either of lock dress or behaviour their eyes were never lifted from the ground their robes of the most beautiful silk hid their hands bosom and neck while their faces only were left uncovered They indulged no airs that might express loose desire and they seemed to study only the  graces of inanimate beauty Their black teeth and plucked eyebrows were however alledged by the Genius against them but he set them entirely aside when he came to examine their little feet  "The beauties of  Circassia  next made their appearance They advanced hand in hand singing the most immodest airs and leading up a dance in the most luxurious attitudes Their dress was but half a covering the neck the left breast and all the limbs were exposed to view which after some time seemed rather to satiate than inflame desire The lily and the rose contended in forming their complexions and a soft sleepiness of eye added irresistible poignance to their charms but their beauties were obtruded not offered to their admirers they seemed to give rather than receive courtship and the Genius of Love dismissed them as unworthy his regard since they exchanged the duties of love and made themselves not the pursued but the pursuing sex  "The kingdom of  Kashmire  next produced its charming deputies This happy region seemed peculiarly sequestered by Nature for his abode Shady mountains fenced it on one side from the scorching sun and seaborn breezes on the other gave peculiar luxuriance to the air Their complexions were of a bright yellow that appeared almost transparent while the crimson tulip seemed  to blossom on their cheeks Their features and limbs were delicate beyond the statuary's power to express and their teeth whiter than their own ivory He was almost persuaded to reside among them when unfortunately one of the ladies talked of appointing his seraglio  "In this procession the naked inhabitants of  Southern America  would not be left behind their charms were found to surpass whatever the warmest imagination could conceive and served to shew that beauty could be perfect even with the seeming disadvantage of a brown complexion But their savage education rendered them utterly unqualified to make the proper use of their power and they were rejected as being incapable of uniting mental with sensual satisfaction In this manner the deputies of other kingdoms had their suits rejected the black beauties of  Benin  and the tawny daughters of  Borneo  the women of  Wida  with scarred faces and the hideous virgins of  Cafraria  the squab ladies of  Lapland  three feet high and the giant fairones of  Patagonia  "The beauties of  Europe  at last appeared grace in their steps and sensibility smiling in every eye It was the universal opinion while they were approaching that they would prevail and the Genius seemed to lend them his most favourite attention They opened their pretensions with the utmost modesty but unfortunately as their orator  proceeded she happened to let fall the words 'House in Town Settlement and Pinmoney' These seemingly harmless terms had instantly a surprising effect the Genius with ungovernable rage burst from amidst the circle and waving his youthful pinions left this earth and flew back to those aetherial mansions from whence he descended  "The whole assembly was struck with amazement they now justly apprehended that female power would be no more since love had forsaken them They continued some time thus in a state of torpid despair when it was proposed by one of the number that since the real Genius of Love had left them in order to continue their power they should set up an idol in his stead and that the ladies of every country should furnish him with what each liked best This proposal was instantly relished and agreed to An idol of gold was formed by uniting the capricious gifts of all the assembly though no way resembling the departed Genius The ladies of  China  furnished the monster with wings those of  Kashmire  supplied him with horns the dames of  Europe  clapped a purse into his hand and the virgins of  Congo  furnished him with a tail Since that time all the vows addressed to Love are in reality paid to the idol while as in other false religions the adoration seems most fervent where the heart is least sincere  ESSAY  COUNTENANCE TO THE VULGAR  WHATEVER may become of the higher orders of mankind who are generally possessed of collateral motives to virtue the vulgar should be particularly regarded whose behaviour in civil life is totally hinged upon their hopes and fears Those who constitute the basis of the great fabric of society should be particularly regarded for in policy as in architecture ruin is most fatal when it begins from the bottom  ESSAY  OPINION OF THE GENIUS OF  VOLTAIRE  BETWEEN  Voltaire  and the disciples of  Confucius  there are many differences however being of a different opinion does not in the least diminish my esteem I am not displeased with my brother because he happens to ask our father for favours in a different manner from me Let his errors rest in peace his excellencies deserve admiration let me with the wise admire his wisdom let the envious and the ignorant ridicule his foibles the folly of others is ever most ridiculous to those who are themselves most foolish  IBID p  THE END
