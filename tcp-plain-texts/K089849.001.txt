 THE GRAY'sINN JOURNAL  IN TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  Non fuit Consilium socordiâ atque desidiâ bonum otium conterere  SALLUST  Eye Nature's Walks shoot Folly as it flies And catch the Manners living as they rise  POPE  LONDON Printed by W FADEN FOR P VAILLANT in the Strand  MDCCLVI  TO THE HONOURABLE  Robert Nugent  Esq  One of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury  SIR  I Have not taken up the Pen to trouble you with an Address in the usual Stile of Dedicators to a warm and lively Imagination such as Mr NUGENT's Novelty will appear an essential Grace in  Composition and what Kind of Novelty can at this Time of Day be introduced in a Form of Writing which has been indiscriminately hackneyed by the Witty the Venal and the Dull for several Centuries I shall therefore have no Recourse to exhausted Topics nor shall I endeavour to cull from the Stores of common Place a Secondhand Garland which would not fail to be offensive to your Delicacy however your Politeness might induce you to excuse the Aukwardness of the Attempt I shall leave it Sir to the City of  Bristol  to speak aloud of your eminent Abilities and to the Annals of Parliament to display the brilliant  Share you have had in all public Debates without adding the Efforts of my feeble Voice to echo back your Fame in Dedicatory Panegyric though I persuade myself were I to trouble you with it one Degree of Novelty might be allowed me I mean Sincerity which I take to be a Quality totally unknown to the Offerers of Incense  BUT it is not the able Statesman I am at present to address it is the Patronage of the Man of Genius Wit and Humour my Ambition has prompted me to solicit and I believe every one will agree with me that I could not any where  chuse a Name more justly distinguished for those splendid Embellishments than that of Mr NUGENT  I AM not insensible that in doing this I may fall under the Censure of the witty Doctor  Young  when he says  As Pedlars with some Hero's Head make bold  Illustrious Markwhere Pins are to be sold  THE Truth is I am afraid the fugitive Pieces contained in these little Volumes will hardly be found worthy of your Attention but if  they are admitted to lie in any Corner of your Study I shall congratulate with myself that they have found so honourable a Shelter and I shall be ever proud of having seized this Opportunity of subscribing myself  SIR  Your most Obedient And most Devoted Humble Servant Arthur Murphy  TAVISTOCKROW  April    ADVERTISEMENT  IT is observed by Lord  Shaftsbury  that every Man who publishes a Book professes Wisdom but the Author of the following Essays begs Leave to make himself an Exception to this general Rule of the noble Writer Having had some Reason to imagine that the Numbers of the GRAY'sINN JOURNAL during its periodical Publication were not unacceptable to the Public he determined not to leave them in their scattered Condition and has therefore been at some Pains to collect them together in as neat a Manner as he could and with as many Retrenchments Additions and Corrections as his various Avocations would permit He has only to add that with all due Resignation he gives up Commas and Points Errors of the Press and all those Inaccuracies which  Horace  tells us arise from Inadvertency or the Imbecillity of human Nature to  the small Critics and anonymous Pamphleteers of whom he has given his Opinion in the Essay No He hopes no reasonable Exception can be made by the Sensible and the Candid to his Sentiments in general or the occasional Frolicks of an assumed Character It should be remembered that Mr  Johnson  's Remark in the  Rambler  is founded upon Truth and Justice "The seeming Vanity" says that excellent Author  with which I have sometimes spoken of myself would perhaps require an Apology were it not extenuated by the Example of those who have published Essays before me and by the Privilege which every nameless Author has been hitherto allowed A Mask says  Castiglione  confers a right of acting and speaking with less Restraint even when the Wearer happens to be known  CONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME  N  o  THE Author's Account of his Plan Page  N  o  Upon

culmina raptat  Laudis amor Studium sequar Insanabile  PRAEDIUM RUSTICUM  _IT has been remarked by Writers whom a Desire of adding to the Entertainment of the Public has incited to portion out their Endeavours into periodical Essays that the first Address in the introductory Explanation of their Plan has occasioned more vehement Corrosions of their Nails and more frequent Rubbings of the Forehead than any other successive Composition in like Manner as we find Men who upon their first Admission into a Company of Strangers betray several aukward Movements in their Deportment arising from the different Ideas of Bashfulness and Diffidence which agitate their Minds until the initial Ceremonies are adjusted As I propose to hold a literary Intercourse with the Public and flatter myself with the Hopes of conversing with  many Hundreds of my Countrymen every  Saturday  I cannot issue out my first Performance without feeling an extraordinary Solicitude for the Event and being disconcerted by those Alarms and Perturbations of Spirit which are apt to seize People of Sensibility in their Tempers when irresistible Principles of Action have prevailed over their Modesty and called them forth into a conspicuous Point of View The first Impression has always great Influence upon Mens Judgments and the Mind will often hastily form Associations of Ideas which it cannot afterwards easily separate On this Account I have been a not a little anxious about my first Appearance and after much Contemplation and deep Study I should have been entirely at a Loss how to set off had not the Example of our parliamentary Candidates pointed out a Mode of Eloquence to which I think proper to adhere on the present Occasion as the most persuasive Rhetoric I can suggest to myself  To the Gentlemen Glergy and Freeholders of  GreatBritain  Gentlemen  As I have had the Honour at a Meeting of my Friends to be put in Nomination to represent you and all your Vices Follies and Foibles in a new Paper to be published every  Saturday  and entitled  The Gray'sInn Journal  I desire the Favour of your Votes and Interest assuring you that I stall at all Times exert my most vigorous Endeavours to serve you being a sincere Friend to the Cause of true Wit and Humour and a steady Assertor of Decency Virtue and Goodmanners With these Sentiments I have the Honour to be  Gentlemen  Your most obedient and devoted Servant CHARLES RANGER  N B  I am of no Party whatever  Having thus declared my Ambition for literary Fame I do not expect that all those rival Wits who for some Time past have been making their Court to the Public should instantly decline the Poll on the contrary I am apprehensive that as it generally happens at Elections much Scurrility will be discharged upon the present Writer and I am no way doubtful but they will proceed to the Extremity of disputing my Property in  Parnassus  and obliging me to make out my Qualification Of this however I hope to give sufficient Proof in the Sequel and whatever Animosities may arise I am resolved to pursue my Course without going out of the Way like the Countryman in the Fable to crush the Grashoppers that may make a Noise around me I shall console myself in that Case with a Reflection that those Nuisances are ever found in the Sunshine  Sole sub ardenti resonant arbusta cicadis  VIRGIL  In the Prosecution of this Design the Reader is not to expect any Scandal any Detraction or Illnature  Ranger  being determined not to indulge himself in the  mala mentis gaudia  as  Virgil  finely calls the Gratifications of a malevolent Spirit As this Paper is commenced to promote useful Mirth and Goodhumour it shall never deviate from those Principles to secure which in my own Temper and to sow their Seeds in others I shall here beg Leave to say a few Words to my Friends the CRITICS  It is observed by Mr  Pope  in the very sensible Pref  to his Works that both Writers and their Readers are generally unreasonable in the mutual Expectations they have of each other the former fancying the  World must approve whatever they produce and the latter imagining that Authors are obliged at any Rate to please them For my Part I should be glad to compound Matters with all the Critics of the Age if they will abate something of their usual Severity my Demands upon them for Fame and Reputation shall not be very exorbitant and should they withhold from me that small Tribute I hope at least they will allow me to make as much waste Paper as the rest of our periodical Writers and daily Historians  From the latter of these viz our common Newspapers I do not perceive what Kind of Advantage can redound to a rational Creature who can neither receive Instruction or Entertainment by reading that Mr  Such a one  an eminent Cheesemonger died at his Country House when perhaps he is in perfect good Health in  ThamesStreet  and if 'Squire  Rent Roll  is arrived in Town with a grand Retinue I apprehend it no way interesting to any Man breathing except his Taylor his Pimp  c  As there is however a Principle of Curiosity inherent in our Constitutions I shall make it my Business to administer to its Gratification by Articles of true Intelligence annexed to every Essay In the Research of these I shall spare no Pains and I flatter myself they will have a stronger Tendency to divert Spleen and Melancholy than dull Letters from the  Hague  and fictitious Advices from the  Swede  and  Tuck  By these Means I shall be able to variegate this Work and render it a Paper of Entertainment if not of Instruction and upon all Occasions I shall think it incumbent on me to have some Regard to what is commonly called Stile For notwithstanding the present Practice it appears to me that such Words should always be chosen as are most strongly and elegantly expressive of the intended Idea and they should if I am not mistaken be combined in such an Arrangement  as will not be offensive to Grammar or unintelligible upon Perusal To this if some little Knowledge of the World can be added I conceive it will be an additional Embellishment as from thence may be derived some just Exhibitions of human Life and some proper Animadversions on Men and Manners in which Articles I may venture to affirm the Writers abovementioned are very deficient they informing us no one Way of the World unless it be that so often inculcated by them Leading to  Mr Keith's Chapel down ClargesStreet and turn on the Left Hand  Henceforth then be it known unto all Men whom it may concern that we  Charles Ranger  Esq  have undertaken and by these Presents do undertake the Conduct of a Paper entitled THE GRAY'sINN JOURNAL which Name it is thought proper to give it on Account of the Author's Residence in  Gray'sInn  We intend that this our Paper shall be a general Critique on the Times and all false Appearances in Men and Books and as we have observed that what Dr  Young  calls laughing Satire has always been most conducive to the End we propose we are determined to exert some certain Powers called Wit Humour and Raillery and we hereby advise our dearly beloved Readers to get their risible Faculties in order reserving to ourselves  more majorum  the Privilege of being dull by Design And it is therefore ordered by these Presents that on or before  Saturday  next all Offences shall cease or they who shall be sound delinquent shall be prosecuted according to the Laws of honest Satire in some subsequent Essay or be obliged to take their Trial upon Indictment in our  Court of Censorial Enquiry  the Proceedings of which shall be faithfully recorded in our  True Intelligence  Given under our Hand  this st of  October    CHARLES RANGER  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  IN order to conduct this Undertaking with the most extensive Variety of Information Mr  Ranger  will not depend entirely upon his own Rambles but has opened a RegisterOffice where all Articles of News will be given in by proper Emissaries and entered in a regular Manner by a sedate Bookkeeper so that there will be little more to do than to select from these Repositories As there will frequently occur short Hints of Animadversion which will not admit an entire Essay I shall occasionally throw out some cursory Reflections dated from this Place and I have given strict Orders to my several Agents to keep a vigilant Eye upon all Objects whatever By these Means the Man of Modesty stealing down the Byewalk of Life shall blush to find his Virtue called into Daylight and the concealed Hypocrite stand in the Pillory of Detection  Amanda  shall not coquet it with every Coxcomb she meets nor  Lothario  make it his Business to ruin all female Virtue In short as the Satyrist expresses it all the Actions of Men their several Passions their Desires their Fears their Resentments their Gratifications their Delights and their Frolicks shall be the miscellaneous Subject of my Lucubrations  Quicquid agunt homines votum timor ira voluptas

Dulce loquentem  HOR  _HAVING recommended myself in my last  Saturday  's Paper to the Patronage of the male Part of my Readers I shall dedicate the present Essay to the  British  Fair and as it is principally calculated with a View to their Service at the same Time that it carries with it a collateral Intention of insinuating myself into their Favour I must beg to be admitted this Morning to their Toilets to call off their Eyes for a little Time from the dearlybeloved Mirrour to discard  Betty  from her Attendance and in short to exclude for one half Hour the whole Train of  Dancingmasters ManteauMakers StayMakers FrenchBarbers Venders of Washes  c  I am aware that the Ladies will be alarmed at the Thought of being alone with  Ranger  but the Reason of my desiring this Dismission of so many Favourites is because I profess the very same Art to which that Class of People have always aspired that of heightening the Charms of Female Beauty and as two of a Trade can never agree I think it absolutely necessary to meet with no Interruption in this important Point from the Pertness of a Chambermaid the Servility of Tradesmen and the Shrugs and brisk Interjections of  French  Proficients who will no Doubt be greatly astonished to hear that their artificial Embellishments though they may serve when they do not luxuariantly wanton into santastic Extravagancies to adorn the Female Form are yet in no Way essential as Beauty without such Auxiliaries may be rendered still more attractive in the Eyes of all Men of Sense  Horace  whom it is unnecessary to introduce to the Acquaintance of the Ladies as  Creech  and  Francis  have taken that agreeable Office upon themselves was a Man of the most finished Taste in all Circumstances of Life and he tells us in the Words of my Motto that he shall always love his  Lalage  sweetly smiling and sweetly talking which two Accomplishments would not have been touched upon by so fine a Poet if they did not carry with them some peculiar Charm and I am inclined to think that in them consists the whole Train of Love's Artillery  Expression has been mentioned by every elegant Writer on this Subject as the first Ingredient in the Composition of Beauty and certainly the more pleasing the Expression is the more Energy will be derived from thence upon every Charm For this Reason the pleasing Smile is the best Handmaid to an elegant Set of Features it give numberless Graces to every Delicacy and diffuses over the whole Countenance an Emanation of that Sweetness of Temper which is the native Ornament of the Fair To this Sentiment the witty Dr  Young  has subscribed in his  Universal Passion  What's female Beauty but an Air divine  Thro' which the Mind's allgentle Graces shine  They like the Sun irradiate all between  The  Body  charms because the  Soul  is seen  This Doctrine has not been established without the utmost Propriety for surely senseless inanimate Matter however Symmetry Colour and other Adjuncts may recommend it cannot any Way gain upon our Affections I have seen many a Picture where the Face was well turned and the Features justly disposed and yet all Men of Judgment have invariably concurred to pronounce the Piece extremely bad because there were no perceptible Traces of a thinking Power within  And if this Property is required in the mere Imitation of the human Face what shall be said when it is deficient in the Original when the Appearance of a Mind which alone can distinguish us from other sublunary Existences and which alone can impart real Satisfaction and excite the social Feelings in an intelligent Being seems to be totally absent Miss  Millefont  is without the nicest Proportion of Features and without a glossy Bloom of Complexion and yet I believe no one ever saw her sitting in a SideBox at a Play or dancing at an Assembly without feeling Love and Joy in sprightly Tumult about his Heart On the other Hand  Formosa  has a Delicacy of Shape and Regularity of Countenance and still no one of Taste will hesitate to pronounce her unamiable and I will venture to assert that she is never toasted but by those whose Intellectuals are so poorly stocked with Ideas that they never perceive the Vacuity in others  The secret Quality from which this Difference arises has been called by the  French  a  Jenescayquoi  and the Phrase has been adopted in this Country but it is serving the Purposes of good Sense to explode so unmeaning a Term For my own Part with all due Submission to better Judgments I declare myself of that Sect of Speculatists who really believe that Women have Souls and I am apt to imagine that the Operation of this inward Agent has no small Influence upon the outward Frame A Poet of Eminence has sung "the Passions in the Features are" and therefore I should think that those Ladies who are ambitious to appear lovely in the Eyes of Men should sometimes sit to an intellectual Mirrour in order to see their Affections reflected to them by which Means they would be enabled to adjust them to harmonize them to keep them in regular Order and if I may so say make them sit right In my Opinion they should be as assiduous to fashion themselves in this Point as to  apply the Patch to reestablish a disorder'd Lock to recal a straggling Hair to settle the Tucker or compose the Mant since taking Care of the Movements of the Mind is also regulating the Features  From this will naturally result the next Essential to Beauty the Manner of Talking agreeably than which Accomplishment nothing can so much enliven the amiable Sex We are pleased to see a beautiful Pair of Lips in Motion when every Thing that comes from them administers to the Pleasures of Conversation the Spirits of the Fair are awakened by the Exercise of their thinking Faculties and the Eye beams with double Lustre the Tongue confirms what the Countenance had before indicated that all within is sprightly chearful gay spirited and sensible The Scene is frequently shifted to our Imagination we are delighted to observe the Celerity which distinguishes itself in the Operations of the Female Understanding and the quick Succession of Ideas which they call up amuses with pleasing Variety while the Beauties of the Mind and Face mutually exalt each other and we stand convinced of the  Platonic  Tenet that  good  and  beautiful  are the same  There are three Things highly pernicious to the Endearments of Beauty from which I must absolutely interdict those who are willing to become my Pupils The Enemies to Loveliness which I mean are GAMING SCANDAL and POLITICS surer Destroyers of every Elegance and Bloom than a Spotted Fever or the SmallPox as chronical Diseases are more fatal to the Constitution than a transitory Fit of an acute Illness  With Regard to the first of these Corrosives I leave it to the fair Votaries of Fortune to consider how the winning Graces and the attractive Smile can irradiate the Countenance when the Internal is disturbed by  Anxiety and Solicitude which soon transpire into the Face and prey upon all their Charms Besides when the Temper is disconcerted Politeness and Goodmanners are in Danger of being neglected and while every one is intent upon the Aftergame which is the fashionable Term for that Clash of Tongues frequently heard in one loud Din as soon as the Deal at  Whist  is out it is not probable that the Fair can converse in a Manner suitable to the Softness and Elegance of their Sex  Scandal  always carries with it a dreadful Efficacy to ruin a delicate Face because it generally springs from Envy or Malice which are both entirely against my Rules for acquiring and preserving Beauty as they are inveterate Habits the Traces of which are apt to wear themselves into the Complexion inducing Frowns Wrinkles Roughness and a settled Appearance of Illnature of all Things the most unamiable  Politics  is also of pernicious Influence tending to inflame the Ladies with PartyRage to cause Heats in the Face and to occasion those Vibrations of the Fan Bitings of the Lips and Fidgets on the Chair which greatly discompose the whole Form On this Account I would have my fair Readers abstain from Parliamentary Debates And tho' the intended  NaturalizationAct  has engrossed the Thoughts of the whole Nation I think it enough for the Ladies to have secretly resolved not to marry a  Jew  and without engaging too deeply in the Controversy the sparkling Crosses which they wear upon their lovely Bosoms will be a sufficient Indication of their Principles and will at once reflect a Lustre upon the Whiteness of their Skins and the Delicacy of their Sentiments  In what has been premised I would have it remembered that I do not mean to recommend a studied Simper or a restless Exertion of ChitChat but I  would have both to be a natural Effusion from the Sources of Goodnature and Goodsense which I am convinced will be found a better beautifying Cream than any Cosmetic advertised in our NewsPapers and therefore instead of lyingin for a new Face or using any other Artifice my Precept to the Ladies is BE GOODHUMOURED FOR A COMPLEXION and I now give Notice that I shall carefully observe in all public Places what Ladies repair a decayed Visage or add new Graces to a blooming one by this Receipt and that I shall insert an exact List of the same in the Articles of News which I shall serve up weekly to regale my Customers Z  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Register Office  Oct    IT is confidently said that several Academies will be instituted in this Metropolis

VIRG  _THE Papers which I have hitherto published were chiefly intended to open a Way for the better Execution of this Undertaking as Pioneers are dispatched to clear the Country for the main Body of an Army and in the same Light I beg that the present Lucubration may  be considered I find since the Commencement of the  Gray'sInn Journal  that I have been the Subject of much Conversation in this Metropolis The Critics it seems are busy in their Enquiries after the Author Does any body know him Has he been long upon Town Has he any Thing in him What Sort of a Man is he These and many other Questions of the same Nature are the Topics at present and tho' at first setting out I thought to evade an Account of myself having had always a strong Antipathy to any Thing that might border upon the ridiculous Character of an Egotist yet such is the Prevalence of Custom that it is now become a Tribute due from every Adventurer in this Way and therefore I shall wave the Resolutions I have taken and will at present gratify the Reader's Curiosity  I am of the sprightly Family of the  Rangers  who have made a distinguished Figure in this Country ever since the Reign of  Charles  II and am a near Relation to my Namesake in the Play whom many of my Readers have often admired when personated by Mr  Garrick  Though I do not at present ascend by Ladders of Ropes into honest Men's Houses yet under a few Restrictions I still bear some similar Habits of his Humour My Education was at  Eton  where I imbibed my first Tincture of Letters though to tell the Truth I was chiefly remarkable at that Place for running out of Bounds I scarcely passed over a Week without paying a Visit to  Windsor  I was delighted in the Castle with the bold Imagery which the Touch of  Verrio  's Pencil has poured fourth to the Eye and to see the Canvas every where glowing with mimic Life was pleasing to my young Imagination  At length with the Character of a wild Lad that had  Latin  and  Greek  enough I was removed to the University where I maintained the same Reputation for five Years Whatever was the Reason of it I never could adopt any PartyPrinciples and those whom I perceived  attached to Prejudices of either Side have always appeared to me in very ludicrous Colours I have known a  Jacobite  drink himself out of his Health and Fortune for the Good of his Country and I have seen a very worthy Gentleman reduced to Necessity by squandering his Substance in Elections to keep out the Pope the Devil and the  French  King I believe there cannot be a more ridiculous Character than that of a  State Quixote  who having Affairs of Moment to himself and his Family generously neglects his own Concerns to take Care of his Country which would be in every Particular as well without such a Patriot  For my part I have no Manner of Taste for Politicks the Election of the King of the  Romans  does not concern me nor do I trouble myself about the Windowlight Tax provided the Prices at the PlayHouse are not raised upon us and as to a standing Army twenty thousand Redcoats shall give me no kind of Trouble while they plant no Bruisers in the Pit to overrule our Decisions Should any such Attempts be made upon the Birthright Privileges of an  Englishman  I shall then be as warm a Patriot as the best of them Not even the Freedom of both Houses shall buy me off and I have now lying by me several Essays on History and the  British  Form of Government which in that Case shall see the Light  These are the Principles I have contracted with Regard to Matters of State as to my Person I beg Leave to be silent on that Head as I do not chuse to receive any Proposals for Marriage which I am told have been publickly solicited by a certain daily Writer Thus much I will hint I am now in the two and thirtieth Year of my Age and after having taken the Tour of  Europe Gray  's  Inn  is become in  Shakespear  's Language  the Seamark of my utmost Sail  I have been registered according to the Police in  Paris  and like Sir  Harry Wildair  in the Play have play'd at Hotcockles  with an whole Convent of Nuns in  Italy  In short I have gone through all the Variety of Manners and Diversions in each different Country and now behold your Beau up to the Ears in Ink I look upon the Gardens belonging to this Society to be the Seat of the Muses Here the great  Bacon  passed his contemplative Hours and here at an humble Distance the present Writer purposes to follow his Steps  Longe sequere vestigia semper adora  STATIUS  The Day I do not take a Turn in the poetic Ground just mention'd I feel the most aukward Sensations and fancy to myself that I breathe with Difficulty This I must own is an Oddity in my Temper but Habit has now confirmed it However I shall make it subservient to the Design of this Paper as it will afford me an Opportunity of collecting Materials for these Lucubrations and among the Number that frequent this Place I shall be able sometimes to glean a few Characters for the Amusement of my Readers Besides this I belong to a Club of  Originals  which meets once in each Month at the  DevilTavern  near  TempleBar  Every Member of it is remarkable for some Peculiarity in his Manners and Way of thinking and this not contracted by an affected Imitation of others but absolutely inherent and native to the respective Persons I shall take a proper Opportunity to bring the Town acquainted with this Society and perhaps may deduce from their Assistance such Matter as will not be disagreeable to my Reader  I must add to what has been said that I have from Nature a very extraordinary Talent which as it will be of Use hereafter I will here explain I have been remarkable from my Infancy for a most surprizing Skill in Physiognomy and have had from my greener Years the sharpest Discernment into the Passions of Men from the Survey of their Countenances This  Faculty has grown up with me and it is now arrived to that Degree of Penetration that I can by infallible Rules read the Thoughts of People When a Critic talks of  Longinus  I can often perceive by the Cast of his Eye that he never looked into him and in all Decisions upon Stile Language and Authors  c  I can discover with a Glance the secret Springs of Action and the latent Prejudices lurking in their Minds Of this more another Time As to the News I shall receive frequent Contributions from a particular Friend who is every Way qualified for that Branch His Name is  Harry Wildair  and I am confident he will conduce a good deal to enliven this Paper  Having thus far explained myself I will conclude with a few Resolutions which I have taken for the better conducting this our  Gray's Inn Journal  Resolved  That this Author shall not be the Tool of any Party whatever  Resolved  That he shall not like the gay  Inspector  trifle with his Readers  over his Tea  or  washing his Hands  but that he shall exert his best Endeavours for their Entertainment  Resolved  That he shall always have some visible Subject and some little Regard to the Order and Propriety of his Words  Resolved  That the Mottos to be prefixed to the Essays shall not be taken at random out of the  Gradus ad

all Times extremely subtile and while we compound vary and associate our Ideas into so many different Combinations the Workings of the Soul are not attended to and the Traces they leave are so delicate that they are afterwards scarcely to be perceived I do not think this Phaenomenon in the ideal World is at any Time so surprizing as in those Moments when the Faculties of bodily Sensation are lulled in Sleep then the Imagination calls forth her abstracted  Train and being free from the Incumbrance of Flesh disports herself in the most whimsical Manner and is at Liberty to form what Appearances what Scenery what Imagery and what Reasoning she thinks proper This I experienced in a lively Manner the other Night and as I cannot help believing that any of my Readers would have been glad to enjoy the same visionary Scene I shall instead of a formal Essay make my Dream the Subject of this Day's Paper  I retired home to my Chambers a few Evenings since in a very poetical Mood and to gratify the present Course of my Ideas took into my Hand  Virgil  's  Georgies  which has always been considered by the Critics as the most perfect Poem of the most accomplished Poet The Delicacy of Expression and every refined Beauty in the Turn of the Stile have been finely treated by the elegant Mr  Addison  and for my Part I never look into it but I perceive some concealed Stroke which had before escaped me But the Enthusiasm which animates the following Passage struck me the other Night in a Manner which never happened to me before  Me quoque Parnassi deserta per ardua dulcis  Paptat amor juvat ire jugis quâ nulla priorum  Castaliam molli divertitur orbita clivo  The Fire and Rapidity in the first Line and the Rapture and Air of Inspiration in the succeeding one must warm any Imagination that has but the least Spark of Fire I could not help dwelling on it with Admiration it opened to my Mind a Train of Images which gave me the most exquisite Pleasure and made such an Impression on my Spirits that even in Sleep they continued to flow in the same Traces they had before been thrown into and thus my waking Thoughts were recalled to me with double Delight  I thought that of a sudden I was hurried away to the Realms of  Parnassus  and that I towered with  Rapture over the several Cliffs which are frequent in those Regions The Air methought seemed to be clearer than what I have ever met with the Skies were brightened into the purest Azure the Sun darted his genial Rays all around and different Streaks of Light blending themselves in sundry Parts of the Hemisphere served to diversisy the Scene the Country smiled in vernal Delight covered with the most chearful Green I had ever beheld In one Part was displayed to View an ample Lawn stretched to such a Length that the Eye lost itself on the other Side presented themselves Meads and Gardens and Laurel Groves Hills there were whose blue Tops grew fine by Degrees and lessened to the Sight amid the Clouds From one of these issued the  Pierian  Fountain which divided into several Rills came tinkling down the Mountain and at the Bottom all assembling into one general Reservoir they there expanded themselves into a pleasing Surface and formed a River which watered all the Country round Here I fell into that State of Mind which is so excellently described in the  Pleasures of Imagination  Then the inexpressive Strain  Diffuses its Enchantment Fancy dreams  Of sacred Fountains and  Elysian  Groves  And Vales of Bliss the Intellectual Pow'r  Bends from his awful Throne a list' ning Ear  And smiles the Passions gently sooth'd away  Sink to divine Repose and Love and Joy  Alone are waking Love and Joy serene  As Airs that fan the Summer  I felt the most ardent Ambition to gain the Summit of the Hill but it was in several Places so sleep that I believe I should never have reached it if  Apollo  had not been favourable to the humble Prayer which I preferred I did not build my Supplication upon any Merit in the literary World but humbly presumed upon the  Delight which I always took in Works of Genius and in  Apollo  's Eye the next Thing to a good Author is to have a Taste and Relish for the Beauties of fine Writing I was struck with reverential Awe at the Sight of the God of Wit and such Melody filled my Ears such divine Harmony enchanted the Place that I instantly fell on my Knees and worshipped the nine harmonious Maids who caused the heavenly Strain They beheld each other with an Air of mutual Affection and Complacence their Eyes were bright with Meaning and I thought that in Delicacy of Shape and Feature they had a near Resemblance to two Ladies known to the World by the Name of the HIBERNIAN BEAUTIES  After paying sufficient Adoration I withdrew from the Presence of the Deities and went round the Place in order to view the Country more particularly The greatest Part of these Regions is portioned out by  Apollo  into different Tenures some of them conveyed to the Person for ever others for Life and many for a shorter Duration There are Mansionhouses built on many of these Estates and the great Genius's who have made a Figure in the World have here fixed their Residence  The Ancients seemed to have by much the largest Possessions though a great Part of their Property was transferred to the Moderns  Dryden  besides his own hereditary Estate had purchased a large Scope of Ground from the celebrated  Virgil  and Mr  Pope  has bought near half of  Homer  's RentRoll Mr  Dryden  spent most of his Time in writing Prefaces and Dedications to the great Men of  Parnassus  and Mr  Pope  was retired to his own House which was situated on the Banks of the River already mentioned and the Country adjacent was laid out in the most exquisite Taste Mr  Pope  was formerly very attentive to the Improvement  of his Land and where the Soil did not yield spontaneously he assisted with Hotbeds This Turn was now quite over with him and his chief Care was to embellish a Temple of Virtue and Happiness which he had raised in the Middle of his Garden  There his Retreat the best Companions grace  Chiefs out of War and Statesmen out of Place  In Company with these celebrated Personages he maintained his own Ease and Dignity and though his Soul glowed within him when sitting with  Bolingbroke  and  Marchmont  he seemed to receive a more near Delight from his  Gay  and  Parnell  The great  Shakespear  fat upon a Cliff looking abroad through all Creation His Possessions were very near as extensive as  Homer  's but in some Places had not received

Eye and even  Milton  was looking for Flowers to transplant into his own Paradise  I was called off from surveying the Possessions of the immertal  Shakespear  by repeated Peals of Laughter  which resounded from an adjacent Grove This I soon perceived was occasioned by the irresistible Humour of  Lucian Cervantes  and  Swift  while at some Distance from them  Rabelais  threw himself into a

presumed to rail with all the Vehemence of a  Billingsgate  Orator against Mr  Christopher Smart  of  Pembroke Hall  Cambridge c  The Prisoner begged he might be heard by his Council which was granted and the Prosecution was closed by Counsellor  Truewit  who enforced his Arguments with such Energy of Language and such Strength of Argument that the Jury were very justly incensed against a Writer

obliged to postpone the Essay I intended for this Day by an Occurrence of such a Nature that I think it indispensably incumbent on me to take some Notice of it I did not imagine before this Incident that a cold trifling frothy Writer could have drawn so much from me but in the Defence of Truth Justice and good Sense I cannot controul myself from it and as he has thought proper to record a Fact I will in my Turn begin with one of as glaring a Die as I have ever known  By these Presents then be it known unto Posterity that in the Year One Thousand Seven Hundred and Fiftytwo there really did exist a daily Author who arrogated to himself the Title of  Inspector General  of  Great Britain  that under this pompous Appellation he took upon him to prescribe Fashions to the Ladies and WireWigs to the Gentlemen Intrigue to Rakes and Taste to pretty Fellows that he pester'd the Town with Dissertations on Fossils Minerals and Insects that never existed but in his own Imagination and from thence emboldened by a kind of negative Applause that of being endured he rose a Degree higher and at a Time when our theatrical Entertainments were  under the justest Regulation did his Endeavours to sow the Seeds of Discontent in the Minds of the Audience to soment Divisions among them and contrary to all Law to raise a Riot at the TheatreRoyal in  Deary Lane  and in a public Paper absurdly encouraged them to throw the Sconces and Benches on the Stage  It is hard to imagine to one's self the Ideas that will occur to Posterity upon Perusal of this most extraordinary Passage they will I am afraid believe their Ancestors at this Period relapsing into the antient  of the first Inhabitants of this Island I have examined the Index to the  Spectator  to the    and  Guardian  for the Words  Riot Benches Sconces  c and I cannot find any Thing of the Kind recommended under any of those Heads nor do I believe such an Outrage to common Sense was ever offered in any civilized Nation of the known World The Authors of the immortal Performances just mentioned endeavoured to cherish Goodhumour Goodnature Social Harmony and Goodmanners Theatrical Merit in their Time was promoted to the greatest Elegance every Thing that carried with it the least Tincture of a vitiated Taste was by them attacked with the most masterly Strokes and now this Essayist would turn the Tables upon these approved Geniuses and by extinguishing all Sparks of Emulation destroy the only Means of heightening our public Entertainments and disabolishing Sense and Refinement among us  As I generally like to trace Things to their Source I have been considering what could be the Motives that induced his  Inspectorship  to this Proceeding and I  I may take upon me to say I have discovered the latent Cause This Prodigy of Genius this florid witty elegant sensible unexhausted  Inspector  owed the first Dawnings of his immoderate Fame I  blush to tell it to a Pantomime Entertainmnt And shall he whose Monsterbreeding Brain spawn'd  Orpheus  and  Eurydice  in whose Head  Hell rises Heav'n descends and dance on Earth  Gods Imps and Monsters Music Rage and Mirth  A Fire a Jig a Battle and a Ball  'Till one wide Conflagration swallows all  POPE  Shall he look tamely on and see his favourite Monsters exposed to Ridicule May he not have some wild Production still in Store Such a Genius never can have done and hence all that laboured Impotence of Animadversion which he has thrown out in two different Papers  But to be a little more serious It is certain that two contending Theatres have always indulged themselves in Strokes of Pleasantry upon each other the  Impromptu  of  Moliere  was a Banter upon a rival House in so polite a Place as  Paris  and a recent Instance will evince that Mr  Rich  has no Aversion to the Practice It is notorious that a few Winters since he engaged a Person whose Abilities consist solely in Mimickry publicly to burlesque as far as in him lay Mr  Garrick  as a Man an Actor and a Manager He has always given oblique Allusions whenever they came in his Way and nothing has escaped him from the Coronation in  Harry  the Fourth down to the Ballad in  Harlequin Ranger  And shall not the Manager of the other House have leave to amuse the Town in his Turn It is acknowledged by the Writer who has occasioned my taking the Pen in Hand that  the Objects are well disposed there is Humour in the Management of them and there is Merit in the Song that explains the Design of their Introduction what is more there is Justice for the Subject  is worthy Ridicule  In saying this he advances nothing but the Truth but when he adds  Where is the Modesty of arraigning the Taste of an Audience to an Audience  c and again  It is unjustifiable it is cruel it is not to be supperted  In the Name of Common Sense what wou'd he be at First there is Merit in it then it is not to be justified there is Humour in it then it is not to be supported there is Justice in it and the next Moment it is cruel For Heaven's sake Mr  Inspector  learn to be a little consistent and don't thus trifle with our Understandings  When a Man will write in this shuffling Manner blowing hot and cold saying and unsaying when an Author who pretends to instruct will run off from the Point in a snipsnap Stile with pert Question and Answer down a whole Column of his Paper it is not eligible to follow him further therefore let his meandering Briskness run what Riots it will for the future I shall here state this Matter in a proper Light and then have done with Controversy  Nothing in my Apprehension shews the Temper of this Nation more than the Ferment their Minds are thrown into by little Divisions of this Nature A real or a mock Monarch a Minister of State or a Manager of a Theatre must eternally embarrass their Thoughts Every Thing among them must be a Partybusiness whereas in my Opinion while their Liberties remain inviolate they should know no Party but a Party of Pleasure and all Differences betwixt  TweedleDum  and  TweedleDee  should be subservient to their Merriment The Field of Humour is open to both PlayHouses and if without Animosity they will cull from thence the Result must be that the Public will receive more Entertainment from a spirited Emulation than from an inactive State This is the Case among the  French  to this Day and those who  weep one Night at a Tragedy of Genius are sure to laugh at the same Piece the Evening following at the  Italian  Comedy And if this Liberty is taken with the noblest Productions of the human Mind why so much Tenderness for what is really ridiculous and unfit for the Stage The  Dramatis Personae  exposed to Derision on this Occasion are if I am not mistaken a  Lyon  a  Bear  a  Cat  a  Dog  a  Monkey  a  Serpent  and an  Ostrich  an admirable Company of Comedians truly but are they such respectable Personages as to claim an Exemption from the Lash of RidiculeAy but  Poor Rich Poor Rich  If by that pathetic Exclamation is meant that he is an Object of Compassion I own I have always thought him such and do from my Heart most sincerely pity him But if through a Depravity of Taste or Debility of Mind he has no Relish for the sublimer Compositions of a Theatre let not us therefore like  Egyptians  worship Serpents Dogs and Monkeys but on the contrary let us by the Assistance of the politer Arts efface all Traces of Barbarism and preserve in all our public Exhibitions a manly Affection for the Cause of Dramatic Poesy of Genius and of  Shakespear  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Bedford Coffeehouse

unwarrantable Attack upon  Rich  's animal Comedians One of these choice Spirits assured the Company that he really believed if this Transaction had not deterred the  CoventGarden  Manager he would shortly have exhibited the  Ornuto Savage  and the  Panther Mare  and the Loss of this ingenious and elegant Entertainment he entirely imputed to the Managers of  DruryLane  In Answer to this a

Saturday  Nov    Crine ruber niger ore brevis pede lumine laesus  Rem magnam praestas Zoile si bonus es  MARTIAL  _IN a former Paper in which I gave some Account of myself I was not in jest when I told my Readers that from a natural Sagacity of Sight improved by Experience and Study I had made a surprising Proficiency in the Art of Physiognomy Among my private Acquaintance I have acquired such a Reputation in this Way that I have known many Ladies who would no more dare to come into my Company than the young Romp in  Swift  's Vision would venture to stroke the Parish Lion after she had play'd at Hide and Hoop with  Jackey  in the Garret Notwithstanding this I am sensible the Majority of Mankind at this Day treat this Art as a mere exploded Imposture like Astrology and Palmistry imposed upon the Credulous in dark and ignorant Ages With them a Physiognomist and a Conjurer meet with the same Degree of Respect and Credit But this Objection I believe will quickly vanish when we come to consider the Principles and Foundation on which the Art is established I might here aptly bring in the Story of  Socrates  and the Physiognomist but it is known to every Body besides Reason alone and not Authority is what I proceed upon  The great and almost incredible Wonder of this Talent consists in being able to discover the Passions Virtues and Affections even at the very Time that they are dormant in the Breast so as to point out a knavish Citizen at his Prayers to know a Cutthroat tho' he smiles or a Fellow that has a Design upon your Fob though he turns his Head another Way with an affected Vacancy of Face to mark out a Fellow whose Mouth is open only to have it stop'd with a Bribe while he is declaiming against Corruption or to detect the Niggard Hand of a Miser in the very Act of seeming Generosity and Munificence Yet all this and more may be done and how it may be done I will here in part explain but I must beg to be excused if I do not reveal some Secrets of this  Arcanum  Every Passion every Virtue and their several Modes Mixtures and Combinations which subsist in the human Breast have a correspondent Set of Muscles in the Face or if the Anatomists will not allow this they at least operate differently upon the same Set of Muscles which when any Affection is Master of the Temper are thrown into Motion and this regularly produces a certain Configuration of Features which is commonly known to us by the Name of  Expression  This the Painters and the Statuaries can also attest and to this they owe the very Soul of their Art for by observing the exact Shape that each different Passion of the Mind gives the several Muscles of the Face and by copying the same upon a lifeless Subject it produces that agreeable Deception which makes us imagine that this Disposition of Features is an Effect of Motion communicated from a thinking Mind within when it is only the Result of their Skill in the Art of Imitation The good Player goes another Way to work he excites in himself the inward Motions  which we call feeling and then the outward Effect upon the Countenance naturally follows  The Anatomists will further inform us that every Muscle of the human Body collects Strength and expands itself into larger Dimensions by continual Exercise and Use as the Legs of Chairmen and others who are used to carry Burthens from the same Cause swell to an uncommon Thickness It follows then that the correspondent Muscles of the Face which express any ruling Passion of the Mind being more frequently exerted grow out of Proportion and become conspicuous above the rest Hence the Face contracts an habitual Air marking the Features with some peculiar Cast of Character which is legible at one Glance of the Eye Any Body can distinguish a Miser a Coxcomb a Leacher or a Glutton in every Circumstance of Life  I know some wellmeaning People may be shocked at the Thoughts of indulging ourselves in the Practice of forming Opinions of Mankind by their Looks This proceeds from a charitable Consideration that as we make not our own Faces we should not be accountable for them but they who think in this Way take no Care to distinguish the  good Face  the  ingenuus Vultus  of the Ancients that which  Cicero  says is the best Letter of Recommendation a Man can carry about him from the  Handsome  the mere Formation of inactive Features and Gloss of Complexion The latter is the Gift of Nature alone and is that which the Philosophers of all Ages have persuaded us is of no intrinsic Value but the former which we understand when we say such a Face is not handsome but is extremely  agreeable  is in every Man's Power to acquire not by studying to put on a formal Simper or smiling Complacency before the Glass but by rectifying  the Mind and furnishing it with noble generous and virtuous Sentiments which transfuse themselves into our Features with an irresistible Persuasion commanding by a secret Kind of Fascination the Esteem of every judicious Beholder I never knew a stronger Instance of this than in the Face of a certain Nobleman who to a vulgar Eye might appear to have an unpleasing Assemblage of Disproportion and Irregularity  I have observed a certain Attorney in  Westminsterhall  who I think has one of the  handsomest  Faces I ever saw and yet through the Lustre of his Eye the Regularity of his Features and Bloom of his Complexion I could read such a settled Habit of the most contracted Cunning so many determined Purposes of Cozenage and Fraud that I protest I could not be easy while the Fellow stood within Armslength of my Pockets Yet to my Astonishment upon Inquiry I learned that several great Families had intrusted this Man with their most important Affairs  Eugenio  is neither happy in a Face nor a Person and at the Time he should have learned to dance was unfortunately employed in forming his Mind upon the Model of the Ancients Hence he has contracted an uncouth Air a College Look and an aukward Deportment yet through all these Disadvantages and a Cloud of uneasy Circumstances the judicious Eye can discover a Soul within capable of displaying the most  divine Attributes of his God  with a Sublimity inferior to nothing but the Subject  On the other Hand cast your Eye upon  Florio Florio  is a Man of Gaiety and plausible Address And there are some whom he hath persuaded to think him one of the prettiest Writers of the present Age By his Dexterity in the Art of Plagiarism he passes upon  the Crowd for a Man of some Learning and I have heard himself say that the Ladies think him a Man of Gallantry and a Wit No Man is more perfectly satisfied with himself than  Florio  he writes with the utmost Facility without any Manner of Subject and this he thinks is Stile Simplicity and Ease Upon the whole one might be so far deceived at first Sight as to think  Florio  a pretty Fellow Yet look at his Countenance can any Thing be more visible than the Furniture within a confused Assemblage of Vanity Arrogance Cowardice Dulness Ignorance and Conceit  Florio  generally wears a Gleam of Chearfulness on his Face and yet it is visible that this is all forced and thro' the false Appearance  Florio  has an uneasy disconcerted Temper  The Mortification in  Sordido  's Leg had like to have gone too far before he could prevail upon himself to be at the Expence of cutting it off I attended him at the Time of the Operation which to the Surprize of every one he bore with wonderful Patience but while others were admiring his amazing Resolution I could plainly perceive by his Looks that  Sordido  's Composure proceeded from the consoling Thoughts that he should hereafter save just half his Expences in the Article of Shoes  I could point out a certain Reverend Gentleman who wears the most plausible Appearance of Humility Sanctity and Grace Ask him familiarly how he does and with a solemn thanksgiving Voice and the Whites of his Eyes turned up with pious Gratitude to Heaven he blesses his God he is very well Yet view his shining jolly Countenance with the smallest Degree of Attention and through this Gauze of Hypocrisy you plainly discover a horrid Groupe behind composed of Pride Gluttony Cruelty and Lust  Yet I'll engage he'll rise in his Profession for he can cringe and flatter with the best  Prudissa  is regular at her Devotions she goes twice a Day to Church she constantly has her Footman to carry her Prayerbook yet I could observe at a Visit the other Day that in some of her Walks there had been more Familiarity between her and this same Footman who then handed the TeaEquipage than was altogether consonant to the Character she chuses to assume  The unhappy  Calista  through the Persidy of the Man she once placed her Affections upon and some Family Misfortunes that followed after is now obliged to  endure  the Embraces of one of the most detestable Leachers upon Earth yet in  Calista  's Soul I can read the latent Traces of Chastity Humility and Love blended with a Tenderness of Distress that sometimes flows into her Eyes and adds such a melting Softness to her native Beauty as nothing that is human can avoid being affected with Yet to a vulgar Eye the unfortunate  Calista  appears no better than the common Tribe of Prostitutes  Not to produce any further Instances at present I can see so clearly into the Characters and Dispositions of Mankind that if some Folks whose Names I could mention do not shortly mend their Manners I will take a general Tour through the Cities of  London  and  Westminster  and unmask every smoothfaced Villain that I meet In the mean Time if a certain Gentleman who generally wears a laced Frock a Bagwig and a long Sword does not lay aside his Project of sacrificing to a Set of Sharpers with whom he is to go Shares the good natured young Nobleman who took a Liking to him for his Honesty I will certainly let his Lordship know the whole Affair And if a certain  Lady of Distinction who by a Side Glance last  Monday  in the  Mall  discovered what intimate Familiarities had passed the Evening before between her and a certain handsome Fellow in a red Coat does not instantly break off all further Commerce with him I must immediately inform her Husband for I cannot any longer bear to see a Man of Consequence and Sense hurt in his Honour by so consummate a Coxcomb but further I must inform the

never wants Wit and has many amiable Qualities but not being a Card player whenever he enters a Room the Lady of the House is sure to receive him without stirring out of the indolent Posture in which she had composed herself "Mr  Mellefont  " says she with her Eyes swimming between Sleep and Wake round the Room "pray sit down Sirone is soI don't know howthis Weather"But let Mr  Hazard  with his Midnight Face make his Appearance her Heart dances at the Sight of him the Bell rings for the CardTable and the House is in an Uproar in an Instant  That I may not pass for  Lumber  among the Ladies I have perused with some Attention Mr  Hoyle  's very judicious and elegant Book on the Game of  Whist  by which Means I can now return my Partner's Suit lead through the Honour  Finesse  and sometimes contrive to bring about an agreeable  Seesaw  With this profound Knowledge I was punctual to my Engagement and that I might see the whole Ceremony of the Proceeding took Care to be pretty early in my Visit  My Lady  Tenace  is a Woman of perfect Goodbreeding and has a very happy Flow of Spirits her Capacity is perhaps as extensive as that of any of her Sex but from a constant Habit of attending to nothing  but the odd Trick she has not laid up so large a Store of Ideas as she might have done by a proper Improvement of her Understanding those Ideas which she is possessed of are in a constant Rotation and she never dwells long upon any Subject but is always sure to say something lively upon every Thing that offers Her Ladyship began to rally me with a deal of Pleasantry upon my being a public Writer when as  Apollo  would have it a loud Rap at the Door shook the whole House I have often wondered at this strange Din with which even though the Entry stands wide open our Ears are always to be stunned upon these Occasions As the Company comes to a  Rout  it is possible this may make Part of the Ceremony and besides the Pleasure of alarming a whole Neighbourhood I suppose the Ladies may think that what with the Thunder below Stairs and the Lightning in their Eyes they sail into a Room with a greater Eclat  This was the Case with Mrs  Fidget  after she had seated herself in her Chair twisted her Body two or three Times to compose herself adjusted the sparkling Cross upon her Neck and given a Discharge to her Fan  Lard my Lady  Tenace  says she I was apprehensive that I should not be able to wait upon your LadyshipMy poor little Dog  Pompey  the sweetest little Thing in the WorldI went Me'm the other Morning to fetch a Walk in the Park a fine frosty Morning it wasI love frosty Weather of all Thingsand so little  Pompey  was with meand if your Ladyship was but to see the dear Creature pinched with the Frost and mincing its Steps along the Mallwith its pretty little innocent Faceand so Me'm while I was talking to Captain  Flimsy  your Ladyship knows Captain  Flimsy  five odious Frights of Dogs beset my poor  Pompey  all at once Me'mthe dear Creature has the Heart of a Lionbut who can resist six at onceand so  Pompey  barked for Assistance and the hideous Creatures made their EscapeThe Hurt my little Dog met with was on his Chestand Me'm there is really Danger that an  Empyema  is now forming in his Side And so Me'mLard is not  Barry  a fine ManYou have seen the  Rehearsal  to be sure Mr  Ranger  Well to be sure  Garrick  's a surprising little Fellow his Eyes have so much Life and such Meaning and such Fire and he has such Variety They say short Aprons are coming into Fashion again  By this Time the Room began to fill and it was Time to dispose the Company at their several Stations for the Night Several Card Tables were accordingly situated in different Parts of the Room and in an inward Apartment a BragTable was prepared for those who are fond of that Game The Thoughts of the whole Company began immediately to flow into another Channel they who were before happy in a mutual Intercourse of social Pleasure became of a sudden secret Enemies to each other and every one had a Design on his Neighbour's Pocket I should think this strange Scene would afford many nice Touches to the Pencil of an  Hogarth  and it would not fail of being highly entertaining to see the different Effects of the same Passion operating upon a Number of People according to their respective Tempers and various Ideas of Winning and Losing To mark this with Delicacy and to blend the private Habits of each different Character with it would in my Opinion show a nice Discernment and be worthy of a masterly Hand to execute it  After a Rubber or two at Whist I detached myself from the Party I was joined to in order to take a Survey of the Room and I could not help wondering how Men amid such a Prosusion of Charms as the Ladies displayed could fit so cool and attentive to their Game and I observed that the Queen of Trumps grotesque and unnatural as the Figure is was the  Venus  of every Gentleman present It is the Interest of the Ladies not to encourage a Gamester for if this should become the ruling Passion of the Men the Labours of the Toilet are all in vain in vain may the Fair dress themselves in Smiles in vain heave the tender Breast Cards have banished Love and so adieu to the female Reign  But this is not all if this Taste continues not only Love but Beauty is at Stake and the Odds are greatly against it While the amiable but delicate Sex sit in painful Durance at a Card Table the liquid Lustre of the Eye is extinguished the Roses fade upon the Cheek and uneasy Passions deface the Countenance  Amanda  is at present in all the Pride of Beauty her is Stature tall and genteel she boasts a regular and elegant Set of Features her Bloom glowing as the Poet's Fancy a mild Radiance beams from her Eyes there is such an inexpressible Delicacy about her Mouth that it is intirely the  Beuche gracieuse  of the  French  and over her whole Countenance is displayed the most winning Sweetness and still Cards render  Amanda  unamiable The Moment she sat down to Brag I could see the young Loves and Graces that were ambushed in every Feature spread their little Wings and a disagreeable Expression immediately succeeded I could not bear to hear so exquisite a Beauty with a confirmed Voice tell a forward young Fellow that "truly she would not be bullied by "him" and to see those Lips which were framed  for the tenderest Purposes gnawed with Vexation was Matter of great Uneasiness to me But the Sensations which Mrs  Pregnant  gave me are not to be expressed The Emotions which she shewed upon fix Aces being discovered in one Pack will I am afraid bring her Child into the World with a convulsed Set of Nerves and I would venture to  lay an even Bet  that it will be marked with a Pairroyal of Aces  When a Passion for Play becomes predominant in the married State I believe it requires no very lively Imagination to conceive the Scene that must ensue not to mention the Ruin of a Family their own immediate Happiness is destroyed as the Poet finely says  Love shall be banish'd from the genial Bed  The Night shall be all lonely and unquiet  And every Day shall be a Day of Cares  I shall conclude

brought me the following Letter a few Days since and as it unfolds some of the Follies which are apt to adhere to the Ladies I shall beg Leave to recommend it to the Perusal of my Female Readers  To  CHARLES RANGER  Esq  SIR  _AS I perceive that you frequently detach yourself from the more serious Business of a Public Writer in order to mix with the  Beau Monde  and that you still retain great Attention to the amiable Sex as you politely call the Ladies I must beg you will permit one of them to break in upon your Studies  You must know Sir that I have hitherto been of that Species of Women called COQUETTES I was initiated into this Science in my greener Yearr and the  whole Course of my Education conspired with other Circumstances against me My Mamma took early Pains to train me up in this Way and the Attendants I had about me all joined to infuse the same Sentiments into my Mind as if they had made a Point of it to reader me egregiously ridiculous From a Child I promised to make a fine Woman as the Phrase is my Features were regular and I must add did not want Delicacy and I had a Bloom that greatly enlivened my whole Countenance The Lesson constantly rung in my Ears was that  Miss should hold up her Head and put forth her Chestand one Day or other she would become a celebrated Toast and then the Men would all be expiring for her  This you may believe was flattering to my Fancy and to give the last Finishing to my Accomplishments for this State of Felicity I was put into the Hands of a  French  Dancingmaster  From this Gentleman I acquired a thousand nameless Arts of Affectation and he not only undertook the Direction of my Carriage in the graceful Movement of a Minuet and the more sprightly Gambols of a CountryDance but the Management of my Features became also Part of his Concern He let me into the whole Secret of the elevated Brow the languishing Glance and the sleepy Eye he instructed me when to display the snowy Breast to move with the easy indolent Carriage to throw the whole Person into a graceful Attitude and after observing that it is a Thing very rare in these Kingdoms taught me the whole Use of the Hands in every Circumstance at Cards or Conversation though it was not without some Pains that I attained the Method of taking Snuff with a proper Air and artful Display of the Fingers  There are a thousand Artifices to make up for the Deficiency of Chat in Company and in all these I became as regular as a Piece of Clockwork Add to this that he recommended to me a great Variety of  French  Romances Novels and Memoirs of Ladies of Quality and to complete the whole he told me one Day with a mighty serious Air that I really had an immense Share of Wit In this Notion I was further consirmed by Monsieur  Lojeunesse  my Haircutter  I assure it you Madam  says he  as my Hair was receiving the proper Adjustment from his Finger  you have indeed ver much  Esprit  Wherever I go to dress de Gentleman it is all dying for you You have dem in Chains Madam pon my Vord just as I have dis Lock here in my Hand pray hold your Head a leetle more aside and all de Ladies envy your Eclat I assure it you Madam  Charmed with these Ideas of my Person my Breast was fired with the Love of Conquest and the Thoughts of being a Wit quite intoxicated me it was enough to turn my little Head for let me tell you Mr  Ranger  Wit is the most dangerous Thing a Woman can think of because it generally ruins the Share of Understanding Heaven has been pleased to bestow upon her I was not content to say or do any Thing in the common Way and I read  Rochefoucault  's  Various Thoughts  in order to retail his brilliant Sayings again in Company I am sure you would laugh at me were you to see the Pains I took to distinguish myself in all Places of public Diversion I think I remember something in a Poet that may help you to an Idea of my Behaviour  She rolls her pretty Eyes in Spite  And looks delightfully with all her Might  My Heart danced within me to hear  Clarinda  in the  Suspicious Husband  utter with an Air  Any Woman can give Ease  I disdained so poor an Accomplishment and to cause Pain and Uneasiness was the Business of my Life To see that the Fellows could not be easy with me nor without me was the Joy of my Soul I read all our modern Comedies to glean up the Airs of the fine Women and I was delighted like Lady  Betty Modish  to hear a tortured Lover bring out  Yet for the Curse of human Race  This Devil has an Angel's Face  Whenever I could meet with a Man of Parts and Sense my highest Ambition was to ensnare him such a one I had a Pride to lead in Captivity and in Spite of all his boasted Reason to play upon his Passions gave me the most exquisite Pleasure  Favonius  is one of this Class he has Understanding without affecting it his Wit is always tempered with good Nature and Politeness he is as handsome as most of his Sex and there is no Requisite in the Character of a Gentleman but what he is possessed of With these Accomplishments he became my professed humble Servant and though he made Love to me in a Manner hardly resistible I delighted in tormenting him if we were at a I lay together I took Pleasure in pointing out to him several young Fellows whom I pretended to be charmed with one I observed had the finest Set of Teeth and the prettiest Smile in the World another the handsomest Forehead and the most delightful Eyes a third had a becoming Head of Hair and Abundance of Wit and though an Underactor perhaps was on the Stage I vowed he was a charming Man In a Countrydance when I perceived his Spirits elevated I  have sat down of a sudden told him I was tired and immediately after begged of him to let me take one Turn wi  h a frightful horrid Creature whom I detested  Notwithstanding all this I really was in Love with  Favonius  but by my own Misconduct he has slipt thro' my Hands The amiable  Elfrida  has won him by her artless attractive Beauty  Elfrida  has always formed berself upon a Plan very different from mine Assability Chearfulness and good Humour were the only Stratagems she had Recourse to and these joined to a f  ne Figure and a lovely Face have made her happy in the Arms of a Man with whom Life will be one Scene of Endearment  This Incident Mr  Ranger  has opened my Eyes and I now perceive that I have been all this Time vainly aiming at imaginary Triumphs and that all my Artifices were like the Wars of the  French  King in  Flanders  serving merely to extend Conquests which are afterwards not to be ascertained On this Account I am now de ermined to divest myself as fast as possible of all my Follies and to attach myself for the future to those Rules of Behaviour which I am sensible add new Graces to the Beauty of our Sex To convince you that I am in earnest on this Occasion I beg you will annex to this Letter the inclosed Paper by which you will see that I am entering upon a new Plan of Life without Delay and your

Order seems to breathe a Spirit of Enthusiasm and they frequently give Vent to the most fervid Ejaculations such as "Dn my Blood" "Damnation""Zounds"  c  It is imagined these different Sectaries

Laudatur bellum hoc hoc bellum an Romule ceves  PERSIUS  _THERE is not in the whole Province of an Author a Point of greater Difficulty to attain than what is called a good Stile an Expression which is in every Body's Mouth but as I take it very little understood by the present Critics I shall endeavour in this Paper to reduce into some Sort of Order the several scattered Thoughts which recurred to my Mind upon this Subject in a vague Manner a few Days since  The Term  Stile  if I mistake not is derived from the  Stylus  of the  Romans  which was an Instrument used by them in Writing upon Wax one End of it fashioned to cut the Letters and the other formed to efface the Impression whenever it should be judged proper Hence  Horace  advises a Writer who would aspire to the Fame of being worth Reading to turn his  Stile  very often that is to rub out and alter the Arrangement and Choice of his Words  Saepe stylum vertas iterum quae digna legi sunt  Scripturus  From this turning and altering is deducible the Meaning of this Expression which is a proper Choice of  Words in a regular and harmonious Disposition This requires a great deal of Art and without a just Sense of the Force and Beauty of Language can never be performed in any Degree of Perfection In some we never can perceive the least Tendency towards it which renders their Works not very palatable to the Reader and in those who have by Practice cultivated this Talent it is an Embellishment to good Sense gives a Lustre and Elegance to every Thing the Author advances and renders his Productions pleasing and inviting I believe there are to be found several Critics from whose Works a good plodding Head may extract very sound and sensible Observations upon all Branches of Literature but while there are those who treat the same Subject with a delicate Touch he must be lamentably dull that would have Recourse to the former and while  Longinus Addison  and  Spence  are not lost to us the  Dutch  Commentators will lie mouldering on Stalls and in the dusty Libraries of insipid Pedants  To attempt to lay down Rules for the Acquirement of this Quality might perhaps carry with it an Appearance of a tacit Declaration that I am Master of it myself which I am far from the Vanity of believing but it appears to me that what Mr  Locke  mentions as the chief Thing to be attended to in the Conduct of the Understanding is also a necessary Step towards this Accomplishment The Thing I mean is an Habit of  Thinking in Train  on whatever Subject the Mind may chuse to expatiate upon by which Means our Thoughts will follow in a natural Order each arising and growing out of the former and the whole connected in all its Parts will by these Means be a regular Composition which at one Glance the Reader may take in and carry in his Mind There is an Association between almost all our Ideas and whenever one of them presents itself to the Imagination an whole Train is wakened into  Life so that if an Author has enlarged his Understanding and enriched himself with a tolerable Stock of Knowledge he need not be apprehensive but his Thoughts will offer fast enough and that too if he has habituated himself to the Government of his Faculties above described in a regular Series This would prevent that violent Straining very perceptible in some Gentlemen of the Quill that Manner of flying off from one Subject to another in a wild incoherent Manner which serves only to bewilder the Reader who expects something of Method and not being able to attend his Author into the Realms of Chaos and old Night he throws him aside as a vague wandering Genius whom he can make nothing of  I am aware that what has been premised may appear to an hasty Peruser digressive from the Matter I first set out with but Thinking is so intimately connected with what is called Stile that it is intirely coincident with the Design of this Essay and is so essential to a Composition that without it Elegance can never be expected and with it it is odds that it will never be wanting To furnish the Mind with Knowledge is a Rule of the ablest of Critics and Words says he will never be deficient to cloath our Ideas  To think clearly therefore is the original Source of good Writing and he who considers things with Perspicuity will also aim at the same in conveying his Sentiments to others This is the main Use of Language and on this Account a good Writer will avoid all Affectation of Glittering all false ambitious Ornaments all Prettinesses all Conceits quaint Turns Points and Antitheses which never can give Strength to an Argument and only serve to enervate and corrupt the Imagination As no Language can possibly have a Competency of Terms appropriated to every different Idea Recourse was had to the Metaphor which consists in transferring the Name of one Object to another on Account of some  Resemblance subsisting between them but by this in the Nature of Things it never could be intended that an whole Piece should be carried on in a String of borrowed Phrases Every body knows how cloying this Manner is in some of the most eminent Writers of the last Century and it would not be hard to point out some of the present Tribe who put off every Thing in such a motly Mixture of farfetched Terms and Allusions that the Sense is hid under a Flourish of tuneful Periods which by the injudicious is called a good Stile and a pretty Flow  Cicero  the Father of Eloquence and the excellent  Quintilian  in several Passages have condemned the two frequent Insertion of Metaphors and  Vida  who was both a Poet and a Critic has elegantly described those Writers who disdain to express their Thoughts in the Terms appropriated to them and though the Subject does not require it must need set off every Thing in the delusive Colouring of figurative Language  Namquè aliqui exercent vim duram rebus iniqui  Nativam eripiunt formam indignantibus ipsis  Invitasque jubent alienos sumere vultus  I believe the late Dean  Swift  understood the true genuine Beauties of Writing as well as any Author antient or modern and I would advise the Reader to open any Part of his Works and try whether he can find any Thing of this florid Manner that at present serves to  elevate and surprize  I am convinced that no Man of common Apprehension need ever read a Sentence twice over in any of this Writer's Productions his Method is perspicuous and at the same time elegant without false Embellishments and his Metaphors all bearing a palpable Allusion to the Thing they are introduced to signify This is a Point which should be always be  considered and even then they should not be sowed too thick nor pursued with a pitiful Ambition to too great a Length Whenever I find a Person erring on this Head he appears to me in the Light of a Child who has blown a Bubble prettily variegated and pleasing to his Fancy and then follows it in order to keep up the Illusion as long as he can In short it has happened in Language as in Commerce What was first intended to supply our natural Deficiencies is now by the Depravity of the human Mind perverted into a Vice the Transgression on the one Hand has been sufficiently condemned by all Moralists and in the Eye of a just Critic nothing can be more blameable than a Luxury of Words  I know there are many other Corruptions which contribute to vitiate a true Taste but I have dwelt longer on this as it appears to me to be the reigning Fault of all our pretty Essayists at present But if Metaphor is considered in the Light I have stated it as only an Aid to the Perspicuity of Language it will no longer pass for an Elegance when it is not subservient to its original Institution Add to this that all tedious Circumlocution should be quite exploded tho' it is an excellent Subterfuge to him who wants to spin out the Sheet To be a great while saying and saying nothing helps out many a  tritical Essay  Writer A Multiplicity of Words of the same Import with a Profusion of Epithets is also very useful upon a Pinch but I believe it is unnecessary to observe that there cannot be a greater Error it should also be remembered that every Species of Writing has its peculiar Manner and its own proper Colouring and whenever the distinguishing Qualities of each are not preserved whenever the different Boundaries are invaded then all Propriety in Writing is destroyed A true Stile should be clear of all foreign Infusions like the River  Marsyas  which  Curtius  tells us glides pure and unmixed within the Fortifications of a Town in  Asia  free from any adventitious Waters to pollute the limpid Stream but when without the Walls it pours along with a more impetuous Current and a swelling Surge it no longer retains its original Name but then commences to be stiled the River  Lycus cum extra munimenta se evolvit majore vi ac mole agentem undas Lycum appellant  After the Choice of our Words the Arrangement of them is to be attended to and in this consists a great deal of the Writer's Art The Reference which the several Terms in a Sentence bear to one another the Strength they acquire by being joined with proper Epithets the Lustre they reflect upon an whole Period when disposed with such an artful Brevity that nothing is perplexed or entangled are all Points of Moment in a Composition and at the same Time that they render every Thing clearer they give Grace and Harmony to the Whole  The Particulars here insisted on are in my Opinion the Constituents of a good St  le but as I am apprehensive I may have been all this Time giving a Specimen of a very bad one myself I shall here release my Reader with this Observation that Simplicity is the first and greatest Beauty in every Production of the human Mind  TRUE

Learning but what constitutes the Oddity of his Character is that he is a  Critic  with Goodnature No Man has quicker Sensations  than Mr  Candid  and hence it results that in perusing the Works of Antiquity or those Writers among the Moderns of allowed Reputation their beautiful Passages strike so forcibly on his Imagination that he admires them to a Degree of Rapture It may be imagined that this Warmth of Temper hurries him sometimes into a false Applause but his Judgment is so deliberate that he generally withholds his Admiration till he is perfectly satisfied that the Sentiment and Diction are just and he is never known to be imposed upon by false Embellishments of Stile or those ambitious Ornaments in Writing which are censured by  Horace  To this Refinement of Taste Mr  Candid  has joined the most finished good Breeding which renders his Company extremely desirable and he is a Source from whence those of his Acquaintance derive many excellent Observations upon every Kind of different Writing  Mr  Abraham Gulliver  follows in Order of Succession to the Chair a Gentleman of very diverting Humours and descended as he himself informs us from that very  Gulliver  whose Travels have been collected with so much Accuracy by the late Doctor  Swift  The Love of recounting Adventures I believe runs in his Blood and he frequently sets the Company a staring at the surprizing Incidents he has met with His Passion for voyaging was formerly so prevalent in him that he never omitted an Opportunity of  sailing for it  as he expresses it and merely to gratify this Inclination he embarked in Lord  Anson  's Squadron found the World He has lost one Eye and Part of his Chin in that Expedition but he does not repine at the Accident as he says it is made up to him in the Acquirement of Knowledge which he insists no Man can be said to possess who has not crossed the Line and attempted the NorthEast Passage He has conversed with a  Bramin  in the East and there is no Place in the Map of which he cannot give some Account He certainly has laid up a large Fund of Knowledge but that tinged with so many Oddities that he is a whimsical Member of Society  After Mr  Gulliver  my Friend  Harry Wildair  whom I have mentioned in a former Paper as my Coadjutor in the Articles of Intelligence claims our Attention  Harry Wildair  has a quick Insight into Men and Manners and Nobody better knows the characteristic Marks and latent Foibles of all whom he meets in the social Intercourse of Life Joined to this Sharpness of Discernment he has made great Enquiry into the Connections and Business of Mankind and is actuated by so strong a Desire of Novelty that he has fixed his Residence at  CharingCross  that he may have an Opportunity of observing the mighty Throng which is constantly pressing that Way He can tell by the Coat of Arms to whom each passing Coach belongs and if by Chance a Vehicle unobserved before occurs to him he is sure to run after it through nine or ten Streets in order to satisfy his Curiosity In short my Friend  Wildair  is all Spirit and Frolick is foremost in every Scene both in high and low Life and he is equally pleasant upon the finer Foibles of the polite and the strong Humours of the inferior Class from whence it results that he is never without a Fund of Gallantry and Humour and his Conversation abounds with a gay and sprightly Variety  The next of the Society is Counsellor  Plastic  of the  Inner Temple  Counsellor  Plastic  was called to the Bar in the Year but the Death of his elder Brother soon rendering it unnecessary for him to attend his Profession he laid aside the long Robe and has since indulged himself in the Gratification of his natural Cast of Mind Instead of Walking in  WestminsterHall  he takes a Turn every Day in the  Lyceum  or  saunters in the Groves of  Academus  In plain Terms Mr  Plastic  is a compleat  Shaftesburian  Philosopher like all the Gentlemen of that inclining he has a polite Taste for the imitative Arts his Imagination is warm and elegant and he has entirely a  Muselike  Apprehension With all this there is a Peculiarity in every Thing he says or does the Christian System cannot stand his Art in Ridicule which he calls the Test of Truth and he adores a Deity of his own making The Doctrine of Rewards and Punishments is to him abominable and his Discourse generally turns on Ideas of Beauty and Virtue Besides the five Senses in common with his Neighbours this Gentleman has a moral Sense a Sense of Honour a public Sense an internal Sense and many other Powers of Perception not mentioned in  Locke  's Essay which is in my humble Opinion the most accurate History of the human Mind In short Counsellor  Plastic  's Imagination has attained a great Degree of Refinement and his disinterested Benevolence is frequently laughed at by Mr  Allcash  who stands last upon the List  It is owing to a Whim of this Gentleman's that our Meeting is fixed at the  Devil Tavern  as he has made a Resolution never to go beyond the Bar Mr  Allcash  is esteemed to be worth half a Plum and is now pretty well recovered from the Shock he received by the Reduction of Interest As he has spent most of his Time in a constant Intercourse with Scriveners and Stockjobbers he has discovered the Artifices of that Class of Men and he is satisfied from that partial View of Mankind that he knows the World He is extremely fond of a Maxim in  Hudibras  What is Worth in any Thing  But so much Money as 'twill bring  This with him is the Test of Truth which he opposes in his joking Way to the  Shaftesburian  Rule he declares that he had rather have a Sense of Money than all the elegant Senses above mentioned and he is a constant Attendant at Church as he says from a sincere Motive of Piety though it is hinted by Mr  Plastic  that he does this because he thinks it is his  Interest  to be saved  These are the Members of the Club of ORIGINALS which has been instituted upon the Commencement of this Paper and as we are willing in order to promote the Design of it to admit new Members Proposals will be received and treated with the utmost Impartiality  N B

Expression which cannot be rendered with equal Delicacy in any other modern Language Of this Sort is a Phrase I have somewhere met with  viz Les petites Morales  which is used by them to signify those subordinate Points of Behaviour which cannot be looked upon in the same Light with Concerns of an higher Moment but are however so essential to our Conduct in Life that they are thence denominated  lesser Morals  A small Share of common Sense will point these out to every Man's Observation but as the Infringement of them is frequent and very often attended with serious Consequences it properly comes within the Province of a public Writer to correct these lesser Deviations and therefore I have set apart this Day to animadvert upon a Transgression of this Nature  The Offence I mean is the notable Art of HUMBUGGING which started up of late Years and has made such an extensive Progress that it is now enlarged into a general Fashion and calls aloud for a CENSOR And here it may not be improper to remind People of the true Definition of Wit which consists in reconciling Ideas between which there is no palpable Congruity in a sudden lively Association To this I will add that Humour is the Talent of discerning the Oddities which constitute the great Variety of Characters this  Kingdom is famous for and exhibiting them in ridiculous Colours to the Eye of the World Things being thus circumstanced I would ask the Tribe of HUMBUGGERS how far a plausible Lie with a grave Countenance will give them a Pretension to either of the two Faculties above described The Truth of it is they are but pitiful Attendants on the Camp of false Wit and if they would consider how easily it is to falsify and how hard to do it with Pleasantry they would in my Opinion desist from so unpolite an Art than which I do not remember any thing more gross more stupid and more senseless An Author of the first Magnitude I think the late Dr  Swift  observes that he never knew above one good Lie in his Life and that one I will venture to say was told by himself and we may believe was a Stroke of Humour free from Scandal or Detraction the distinguishing Characteristicks of our modern Adventurers

who first set the Thing on foot enjoys the Joke in secret and laughs at the Tale his Facetiousness propagated And in this is contained all the Wit and all the Humour and all the Fun of all the  Humbuggers  of the Age  I could wish that this Tribe had subsisted in the Days of  Horace  because then we should have them under some proper Appellation delivered down to Posterity with the  Ambubaiarum collegia Pharmacopolae  Mendici Mimi Balatrones hoc Genus omne  But I do not think that the polite Authors of  Greece  and  Rome  seem to have the faintest Idea of this egregious Turn In all the Characters of  La Bruyere  there is no such Monster to be found the Wits of King  Charles  's Time were absolutely ignorant of it In the Reign of Queen ANNE  which  to use the Words of a fine Author  notwithstanding the happy Days that have succeeded every  BRITON  may yet remember  I say in the Reign of Queen ANNE when Wit Humour Imagination and every elegant Talent were in their highest Perfection nothing of this Sort arose In short it seems entirely reserved to grace the Annals of these latter Days and I make no doubt but it will give a surprising Eclat to the Pages of some future Historian to have it related in a pompous Stile that in the Reign of his Majesty King  George  the Second by the Grace of God King of  GreatBritain France  and  Ireland  Defender of the Faith and so forth the never enough to be admired Art of  Humbugging  came into Vogue and was the Amusement of Tea Tables  the Delight of the Court and the Study of Beaux and pretty Gentlemen from whom it descended to all Ranks of People and became the general Fashion of the Kingdom  Instead of expatiating any further on this sprightly Absurdity I shall close this Paper with a Passage from Lord  Shaftsbury  whose Decision upon Wit and Manners I believe will not be contested  'Tis real Humanity and Kindness to hide strong Truths from tender Eyes and to do this by pleasant Amusement is easier and civiller than by a harsh Denial or remarkable Reserve But to go about industriously to confound Men in a mysterious Manner and to make Advantage and draw Pleasure from that Perplexity they are thrown into by such uncertain Talk is as unhandsome in a Way of Raillery as when done with the greatest Seriousness or in the most solemn Way of Deceit It may be necessary as well now as heretofore for wise Men to speak in Parables with a double Meaning that the Enemy may be amused and they only  who have Ears to hear may hear  but it is certainly a mean impotent and dull Sort of Wit which amuses all alike and leaves the most sensible Man and even a Friend equally in Doubt and at a Loss to understand what one's real Mind is upon any Subject This is that gross Sort of Raillery which is so offensive in good Company and indeed there is as much Difference between one Sort and another as between fair Dealing and Hypocrisy or between the genteelest Wir and the most scurrilous Buffoonery

persuade myself a Production of his cannot fail to contribute  to the public Entertainment and therefore I shall not by a longer Preface detain my Readers from the Perusal of it  To  CHARLES RANGER  Esq  SIR  _THE Bill lately said to be before the Legislature for encouraging Industry however extraordinary it might be in some Particulars was I do not doubt extremely pleasing as to its general Purport to a Man of your Character For my Part I have ever beheld with Pleasure the Motto with which a certain eminent Physician has long adorned his Chariot  viz Non sibi sed toti  and am for promoting Industry in a more exalted Signification of the Word than that in which it is most commonly used I mean as it tends to the Good of Mankind without the least Tincture of private Advantage  When very young I remember to have read in some Author that the  Turks  are obliged to exercise some Trade or Occupation which may contribute to the public Emolument and that even their Emperors have no Exemption from this Institution It is true a certain Sultan a Kind of Wag very artfully evaded the Force of the Law by the following Device The Musti it seems had reproved him for being so unmindful of what their Prophet had expresly enjoined as to spend all his Time in following Hawks and Hounds The next Morning the wily Sultan sent his troublesome Monitor an handsome Present of wild Fowl and Venison informing him at the same Time that being convinced of the Justness of his Reproof he had in Consequence thereof taken up the  Trade of a Hunter  Far from approving such a Mahometan Equivocation I began to consider wherein I could be of the most general  Use to my Fellow Creatures without the least Regard to any selfish Views I found myself in Possession of an ample Patrimony and consequently a Subsistence was out of the Question As to Divinity Law the Navy or Army I was aware that they carry with them some glittering Toy which more or less attracts the Hearts of even the most philosophic of their Followers A  Mitre  for Example the  Great Seal a Flag at the Maintop  or a  Truncheon  have their respective Charms and no Doubt operate accordingly on the Conduct of their several Admirers  To all these Allurements I resolutely shut my Eyes and determined to set a noble Example void of any the least concomitant SelfInterest Thus resolved to dedicate my Time and Studies to the Service of Man including Woman I made Choice of an Occupation of universal Consequence to the World but of which none except a few mercenary Pretenders have ever made public Profession Not to keep you any longer in Suspence Mr  Ranger  the Profession I have taken up and exercised for some Years is that of a  Dentifricator  or what the Vulgar call  a Cleaner of Teeth  I have heard with Rapture of a certain  Worcestershire 'Squire  who formerly applied himself with great Success as well as Assiduity to cutting and curing the Corns of all those he could persuade to make an Experiment of his Skill Not long since a noble Peer was famous for thirsting after a few Ounces of the Blood of all who came near him not from any Cruelty of Temper but purely on account of the exquisite and laudable Pleasure he took in the Use of the Lancet Even  Peter the Great  the immortal Refiner of the  Russian  Empire greatly delighted in drawing the Teeth of every one who betrayed a Pain in those Parts by holding his Handkerchief to his Mouth by making wry Faces or any such Indications Of this I have been assured  by an Eyewitness of his Dexterity To the common Soldiers he gave a Crown for every Tooth he deprived them of which indeed encouraged so many poor Wretches who were ignorant of the Value of their Grinders to undergo the Operation of an Imperial Hand that the Officers remonstrated to his Majesty that if he continued to make such Depredations in the Months of the Soldiery he might disband his Troops as they would be fit for Service no longer than they could eat  To a Persen of Mr  Ranger  's Sagacity I need not remark how much my Profession of cleaning beautifying and preserving the Teeth surpasses the inconsiderate Zeal of that great Man Every one is sensible how much we surpass all other Nations in the Bravery of our Soldiers and the Dexterity as well as Intrepidity of our Mariners and yet it is well known that all this depends on eating and of course on the Goodness of their Teeth And as to our Beaux and Belles how much the Force of their Charms is assisted by a delicate Set of Teeth is a Truth so evident in itself as not to need the least Demonstration  In Consequence of these Reflexions I applied myself to study every Author who has wrote on this Subject I went so far as to take an  Arabian  into my House to instruct me in his Language that I might be able to consult the Writers of his Country in the Original as well as the Authors of  Greece  and  Rome  After this I travelled over all  Europe  to converse with such as profess this noble and delectable Operation I have even put myself in their Hands in order to acquire every Excellence as well as avoid every Defect incidental to my brother Operators  Some Time since Mr  Ranger  you favoured us with an Account of the Progress you had made in Physiognomy You therefore will easily believe what I am  going to relate of my own Sagacity By a curious and exact Observation of the various Marks on the Teeth in different Persons from the continual Friction they undergo as well from each other as from the Tongue and Lips I am able to discover what Passions their several Owners are subject to and how far they indulge them particularly as to  Anger Envy  or  Love  It's an old Remark that Proverbs are a Kind of Test of national Wisdom and are either literally or allegorically founded on Truths of no small Importance Now I need only instance a few of these pithy Sentences to convince the most Incredulous what great Discoveries may be made by a skilful Contemplator in this Way As for Instance  Such a one has all his EyeTeeth He shews his Teeth but cannot biteA third has a soft Tooth in his HeadThis good Lady has a Colt's Tooth left yetAnother has a liquorish Tooth  c I have made many Observations of this Nature and even at first Sight I can discover whether a certain Mark be out of a young Lady's Mouth or not in plain  English  whether she be in a State of pure Virginity or has really given it up or in what Degree of Danger she is of so doing by the Indications her Teeth contract from being frequently applied to the Sheets or Pillows In some I have discovered after their having been in Company with two SisterGraces a certain Dutchess and Countess that shall be nameless whether their Teeth have been affected by the corrosive Qualities arising from Envy or brightened by the Motion of the Lips occasioned by the Smiles of a pleasing Admiration  I have already taken up too much of your Time and therefore decline giving you an Account of my Travels for the narrow Considerations of Wife or Family cannot long detain me at Home in Search of all Opportunities of improving myself in the Art of preserving  and beautifying those useful Implements the Teeth It is true I was lately very near abandoning my Profession through the Treatment I met with from a certain great Prince in  Germany  who pretending to want my Assistance no sooner got my Finger in his Mouth than closing his Foreteeth he held me fast in the greatest Pain imaginable and at the same Time he spoiled with one of his Grinders the nicest

to cope with that instead of wondering at the Dearth of good Papers of late I am surprized that any Advances are made towards it The  Pangs of despised Wit  are perhaps equal to  those of despised

MODERN CRITICISM with some Account of its Parentage and Education  ILLNATURE is the Founder of the Family in a Fit of petulant Delight this Personage was joined in Wedlock to the celebrated Dame IGNORANCE The Issue of this happy Marriage was ENVY who being of a consumptive Habit of Body and no very amorous Disposition was deterred for a long Time from any Thoughts of Matrimony but at length meeting with MALICE he took an immediate Fancy to her and by a Sympathy of Soul this lovely Pair were led to a mutual Liking for each other MALICE was an old Maid of a lean shrivelled Habit of Body and delighted greatly in Teatable Chat At first the Relations of ENVY were disgusted at the Match as they imagined from the Lady's Looks that there was not any probable Likelihood of their having Issue by which it was apprehended the Family would be totally extinct But Things are not always to be taken by Appearances though the newmarried Couple lived together like Cats constantly scratching and quarrelling they still found softer Moments of Dalliance and in about nine Months CRITICISM was ushered into the World The Tidings of this happy Occurrence were soon wafted towards  Grubstreet College  Mother DULNESS raised her drowsy Head pleased with the Account of the sprightly Dunce and all her Votaries hailed the newborn Babe In  Parnassus  the Effect was far different  Apollo  started

shall here throw the whole Pedigree in one View before the Eye of the Reader  ILLNATUREIGNORANCE  ENVYMALICE  CRITICISM  Like  Richard  the Third the Infant was born with Teeth and the Moment it perceived the first Ray of Light it began to hiss Several of the usual Playthings given to Children were immediately bought but nothing could allay our young Hero's Cries until a Catcall was given into his Hands of which by a Kind of Instinct he instantly found the Use and he seemed to take a malicious Pleasure at the Shrilness of the Sound In process of Time an Hornbook was procured for the young Gentleman and at the first Sight of it he grew extremely peevish and shortly after began to pull it to pieces In this he was encouraged by his  Grandmother  who alledged it would spoil the Child's Eyes but it is confidently said that he at last took to it of himself but that he applied at random in a very irregular Manner and I am credibly informed that he could not be induced to pursue the Alphabet in its natural Order but that the first Letters he became acquainted with were  D A M N  It is a Question with many whether he ever went further but after some Pains in the Research I have found from some secret Memoirs that he really did learn to read the TitlePages of Books and Pamphlets in order the more effectually to abuse them  Our Youth in his Countenance had a blended Resemblance to his Parents with a very great Air of his Grandmother From his  Grandsire  he derived a Disposition to all Kinds of Vice and therefore the evil  Qualities of his Father thrived in a Soil admirably fitted for their Reception Pleasure he was an utter Stranger to unless the Misfortunes of his Neighbours excited the mixed Sensations of that malignant Joy mentioned by  Ovid  Risus abest nisi quem visi movere dolores  Nothing could ever rouze him to an Emulation of others whom he perceived to excel but he sat pining and selftormented at the Idea of their Merit and having a Volubility of Speech from his Mother he vented his Spleen in Obloquy and scandalous Invective In these Qualities he made great Improvement and each Day added some new Accomplishment such as  Impudence Pertness Illmanners  c  Being now arrived at Maturity he grew wondrous fond of Coffeehouses and turned out a complete  Blood  He was constantly seen poring over the  Magazines  and if he ever met with a Production of Genius he shewed great Perturbation of Mind and was often heard to pronounce with some Vehemence  PishExecrableDamnea StuffO Gd  He went to the Playhouse on the first Night of every new Piece the Players dreaded the Sight of him in the Pit there he talked of Actors whom he never saw retailed Authors whom he never read tore up Benches grinned and chattered hissed and clapped yawned and slept Having heard that  Aristotle  's Art of Poetry was esteemed among his best Performances he bought at a Stall a certain curious Production entitled  Aristotle  's  Masterpiece  which gave him a mean Opinion of the Ancients and thence he took Occasion to ridicule all Kind of Learning and became a Delegate of his own Choice to direct the Taste of the Age and if a young Author shewed any Traces of Elegance in a Composition or discovered a Vein of Thinking capable of  further Improvements he endeavoured to nip him in the Bud  To conclude CRITICISM has been upon Town for several Years and still continues in the Practice of every bad Quality deducible from a weak Head and a corrupt Heart but as I intend to persevere in the Work I have undertaken I will cut Matters short and inform this Gentleman and all his Followers that after this I shall not suffer myself to be diverted from the Drift of this Design I think I shall be able to offer some Compositions not quite unworthy of the public Perusal and if I do not point out any unknown Truths I shall endeavour to place every Thing in a Point of View that I hope will sometimes give it the Graces of Novelty  I shall continue to prefix a Motto to each Lucubration from some celebrated Author of Antiquity and this not out of any Affectation but because from an early Taste for those excellent Writers many of their Beauties have insinuated themselves into my Imagination in so lively a Manner that they recur on almost every Topic This serves very often with the Classic Scholar to place an entire Essay before his Eye at once and to see a fine Passage start into a new Light and carry a witty Allusion to a Subject in Appearance foreign to it must in my Opinion excite agreeable Ideas in the Fancy  The mere  English  Reader

other Day put a Letter into my Hand which he informed me he had just received from an Acquaintance who lately took a Trip to  Paris  As it exhibits a pretty lively Picture of an  Englishman  who has set up the Customs and Manners of his own Country as the indisputable Standard of what is right and therefore treats every thing he finds different from them with Contempt perhaps the Public will not be displeased to peruse it I shall present it then as the Entertainment of this Day not doubting but that it will be relished at least by those Readers who have had an Opportunity of observing the ridiculous Manner in which our Countrymen spend their Time in that elegant Metropolis of the polite World  Paris  Jan    Dear  HARRY  I HAVE been in this strange Place about six Weeks and find myself in such a whimsical Situation that I may truly say with  Petulant  in the  Way of the World I am like a Dog in a DancingSchool  Upon our first Arrival here we took a  Fiacre  and drove to our Banker who lives up four Pair of Stairs As he was our Countryman we thought him the most proper Person to direct us and accordingly enquired whether there were any good Lodgings to be let in the  Rue de  Boncherie  for you must know  Harry  we were informed before we left  England  by some Gentlemen who said they knew  Paris  very well that we should take up our Residence in that Part of the Town But the Banker smiled at the Question and told us that the  English  Gentlemen had deserted that famous Street ever since the  Harlequin  at the  Italian  Comedy in making Love to his Mistress told her among other Professions of his Passion  that he loved her as violently as my Lord  Anglois  did the  Rue de Boucherie He added that he would take care to fix us in a proper Lodging and conducted us to  Peyri Bagneur  in the  Rue Dauphine  who accommodated us with a very good Apartment Our next Care was to equip ourselves in the Fashion of the Country Accordingly we sent for a Taylor and  Jack Commons  who jabbers a little  French  directed him to make us two Suits which he brought us the next Morning at Ten o'Clock and made compleat  Frenchmen  of us But for my part  Harry  I was so damned uneasy in a fulldressed Coat with hellish long Skirts which I had never been used to that I thought myself as much deprived of my Liberty as if I had been in the  Bastile  and I frequently sighed for my little loose Frock which I look upon as an Emblem of our happy Constitution for it lays a Man under no uneasy Restraint but leaves it in his Power to do as he pleases I must not forget to inform you that we hired a  Swiss  Servant whom they call here  Valet de Place  and to him we entrusted the Management of every Thing which saves us a great deal of Trouble and I really believe the Fellow to be extremely honest for I do not find that I spend more Money here than in  London  As it is absolutely necessary to have a Coach in  Paris  we engaged a  Remise  during our Stay and indeed it was indispensably  incumbent upon us to set up an Equipage for we commenced Lords immediately upon entering the  Fauxbourg  St  Germain  Zds  Harry  these People think that every Man who looks aukward and throws away his Money is an  English  Lord nay they are so liberal of this Title that they call the  English  Taylors and Perukemakers who sometimes pay them a Visit  des petits my Lords  You may believe my Friend I was very desirous to see their Theatrical Entertainments I have indeed been at one or other of them every Night They are d strange Sir Not the Thing by any Means I do not it is true understand the Language but their Manner is quite different from oursThe Players seldom or ever throw out the Voice with any Vehemence but speak in as natural a Manner as if they were off the Stage That would not be borne with us You know however the  French  are pleased with it as they know no better The first Time I was at the Playhouse I imagined there had been a Riot the Night before for I observed there were no Benches in the Pit But in this I was mistaken for there never are any Seats in that Part of the House the Reason is I suppose because a  Frenchman  could not sit still during the Performance With Respect to the Manner of living  Harry  it is intolerable By Heavens I should have been starved if I had not luckily got acquainted with an  Irish  Abbe of  Lombard College  one Mr  M' Manus  a very good Sort of a Man though a Popish Priest He has a cursed queer Way of talking indeed his Accent being a Mixture of the Brogue and the  French  Cadence and his Phrases generally literal Translations from the  French  He is notwithstanding a dd honest Fellow and will get drunk with any of his Friends at a Minute's Warning If it had not been for this Gentleman who conducted me to a little Place kept by  one  Kemp  where I got a Leg of Mutton and Turnips and Beefstakes I should have been obliged to set out Post for  England  'Tis true upon Honour My Life was at Stake I could by no Means live upon their  Soup and Bully  and footy Kickshaws made of stinking Meat Their Wines it must be allowed are pretty enough when one is used to them but at first they seem prodigious weak They have not half the Body of our Wines in  England  But that is easily accounted for the best Growths being always sent to us at least  Venables  and  Tomkins  tell me so In mentioning  Kemp  's I should have told you of an ugly Scrape I had like to have fallen into I got into Company with an Officer of the  Scotch  Troops in the  French  King's Service and I began to hum him about Party Affairs but dn me he soon gave me to understand that I was on the wrong Side the Water for that Fun and insisted that I should give immediate Satisfaction Gad I reflected it would be confoundedly silly to get pinked in a Popish Country where they would not allow me a Christian Burial and so I asked his Pardon and the Affair was made up by the Mediation of Abbé  M Manus  This has cured me from attempting any Sport of that Kind while I stay here You will be surprized perhaps that I give you no Account of the People To tell you the Truth my Friend I do not know any of them I went once to an Ordinary and the Company were so remarkably civil to me that I began to think they had a Design upon me but my Friend  Jack Commons  who has studied the Law and knows these Things tells me this excessive Politeness proceeds from their living under an arbitrary Government I cannot help laughing at the immense Number of  Chevaliers de St Louis  which I meet every where These Gentlemen are as numerous here as Knights  have been in the City of  London  since the Year Fortythree They wear a little enamelled Cross hanging to a red Ribbon which is fixed in a Button hole of the Coat and most of them have a Streak of Dirt on their white SilkStockings about an Inch above the Shoe which I suppose is Part of the Order As to the Government of this Country I have not thought it worth my while to enquire about it for I am satisfied with old  England  and there will end my Days I have had very few Amours since I left  England  for I do not know how it is I am dd shy of the Women here they are so devilish sprightlyI know three or four of them whom my Barber recommended me to but they are not of the first Class  To conclude dear  Harry  Mr  M'Manus  has carried me through all the Curiosities in and about  Paris  and now my Time lies very heavy on my Hands for as I have no Acquaintance and am unwilling to enter into any Connexion with People in a strange Country I am at a Loss what to do with myself in an Evening The Day I contrive to pass away tolerably in sauntering in the  Tuilleries  until Dinner which brings all the  English  together at  Kemp  's from thence we adjourn to  Procope  's until it is Time to go to the Play which kills the Time to about half an Hour after Eight but when the Actors dismiss us we are perplexed to determine how we shall dispose of ourselves and are in the End obliged in our own Defence to return to  Kemp  's and play a Game at Whist This Way of Life will not do with me and in about a Fortnight you may expect to see me when we

PERSIUS  _THE Club of which I am a Member and of which I have already given some Account in this Paper is not a Consederacy in Riot and Debauchery but was instituted with a View of enjoying a pleasing Converse rather than of contending with each other for the Renown of the most potent Constitution or the most capacious Swallow Accordingly our Discourse generally turns upon some Topic that may serve to disclose the Humours of Mankind or carry our Taste to a greater Degree of Refinement in the polite Arts  An Evening of this sort I was sure to enjoy at our last Meeting as the Chair was to be filled by Mr  Candid  whom I have formerly described as a very odd Critic good Nature and Knowledge being Peculiarities remarkable in his Character As soon as the mutual Civilities were exchanged between the Company this Gentleman acquainted us with an Occurrence which is really of a very extraordinary Nature As he was walking in the  Piazzas  at  CoventGarden  he perceived a Man extremely busy in pasting up against the Walls Advertisements of so singular a Furport that he was  induced to beg one of them which was read out to the Club and was in Substance as follows  Lately launched at  Deptford  a Ship called the  Pantomime  now lying at  Irongate  whereof is Owner  John Lun  Burthen seven hundred Tons mounts four and thirty Guns and bound directly for the  SouthSeas  in quest of Monsters of all Sorts to cruize for some Time in those Parts and thence to bear away to the unknown World to touch upon the Coasts of  Asia  and  Africa  and return home North about in order to stock our Theatres with the wildest Exotics that can be met with Good Encouragement will be given to all Seafaring Men who will ship themselves on board the  Pantomime  above mentioned and as a Corps of Marines will be requisite disappointed FortuneHunters broken Gamesters Henpeck'd Husbands Underactors  c  shall be received and enter into Commission forthwith  N B  Apply to any of the Brokers on Change at  Sam  's Coffee house  George  's  TempleBar  the  Bedford  or the StageDoor of the Theatre in  CoventGarden  This Piece of Intelligence gave no small Astonishment to the rest of the Company but our Chairman declared he had seen so many strange Turns in Life that he did not doubt but it would be absolutely carried into Execution and added that it would certainly draw prodigious Houses to have it mentioned in the PlayBills that the principal Parts in a new Entertainment will be performed by a wonderful  Armadillo  from  Brasil  a  Serpent  from the River  Oronoque  the famous  LanthornFly  from  Peru  a  Mermaid  from the  Ladrones Islands  a surprising  Camel  a  Rhinoceros  and many horrible Animals  being their first Appearance on the English Stage  Mr  Candid  proceeded to observe that  poor Shakespear  who used to flourish like the Thorn at  Glastonbury  in  the Depth of Winter must now entirely be destroyed but however to prevent as far as in him lay this threatning Mischief he informed us that he has drawn up with no small Pains a Pamphlet entitled  A modest Proposal against abolishing Nature and  Shakespear  at this Juncture  addressed to  David Garrick  Esq  with whom he hoped it would have due Weight as all his Performances have displayed a true Relish for our great Poet's masterly Touches and as the Course of his Management has proved him to be a cordial Friend to Genius and Letters  "And now since I have mentioned Mr  Garrick  " continued he  I had rather see him come out from the Murder of  Duncan  in the Character of  Macbeth  with the Daggers in his Hands than behold a Fountain of Tin playing in Jetteaus a real Cascade or a Countrydance by all the Monsters of the CreationI may be out in my Taste but there are Touches of Nature in the Play just mentioned which I shall always reflect upon with Pleasure though I cannot help wondering that  Garrick  who always strikes out the brightest Ideas should attach himself to the common Reading of a Line in the Part of  Macbeth  when so noble a Meaning is to be extracted from the same Passage The Thing I mean is when he looks at his Hands and breaks out into the following Speech  With all great  Neptune  's Ocean wash this Blood  Clean from my Hand Nothis my Hand will rather  The multitudinous Sea incarnadine  Making the Green one Red  The last Line is generally pronounced as if  Shakespear  meant the GREENONE which after the pompous Expression of the  Multitudinous Sea  would render it liable to the Imputation of an Anticlimax whereas  if it is understood as  making the Green  ONE RED i e the Colour of the Sea which is of itself green  one intire universal Red  it would close the Passage with a Dignity responsive to what precedes and adequate to the Vastness of  Shakespear  's Conception as it not only keeps up the Image impressed upon the Mind by the Term MULTITUDINOUS Sea but also heightens the Horror of  Macbeth  's Crime the Blood he has spilt being sufficient to convert the natural Colour of the whole Ocean intoONE RED  This Interpretation may perhaps not appear  Orthodox  to those who are bigotted to  Playhouse Tradition  but by our whole Club it was thought extremely just and Mr  Plastick  the  Shaftsburian  Philosopher received it with an Air of Enthusiasm declaring that it suggested an Idea which expanded the Imagination the more it dwelt upon it After this he offered some Doubts which arose in his Mind concerning a Passage in the same Play of which he conceived the Meaning though he did not see the Propriety and Consistence of the Figures The Lines hinted at are in  Macbeth  's Soliloquy concerning the Deed he was to perpetrate  I have no Spur  To prick the Sides of my Intent but only  Vaulting Ambition which o'erleaps itself  And falls on th' other  Mr  Candid  immediately reassumed the Discourse  The first Thing to be observed said he is the Rapidity of  Shakespear  's Imagination and the quick Succession of Ideas which it supplied him with The metaphorical Expression in the Verse  I have no Spur to prick the Sides of my Intent  gave Occasion to the Figure following in the succeeding Line  But  VAULTING AMBITION  which o'erleaps itself and falls on th' other  The Allusion is to a  managed Horse  and AMBITION is represented as a Person who endeavouring to vault into the Seat by the Violence of his Effort overleaps himself and falls quite on the other Side  The  Shaftsburian  returned Thanks for the Light thrown upon this Place and observed that the Interpretation is perfectly applicable to the Circumstances and Conduct of  Macbeth  when Mr  Allcash  the Citizen interposed and told us that for his Part he did not mind your Plays muchthat he went to see  Garrick  at  Goodman  's  Fields  and could not help laughing to see the People cry at  King Lear  when he knew it was all a Play and paid his Money for it This contributed to ruffle the Temper of Mr  Plastick  who instantly harangued upon the  Public Sense  the  Moral Sense  and the  Internal Sense  but Mr  Allcash  was not to be beat out of his Way and instead of paying any Deference to this Doctrine he desired an Explanation of a Line in  Othello  where  Iago  says  Who steals my Purse steals 'Trash 'tis something nothing  Is there not  said he  some Mistake in calling Money  Trash  and  something nothing  The Chairman smiled at this Observation which he promised to consider at his Leisure and for the present proceeded to give a Correction of a Mistake in  Othello  in the fifth Act of which  Iago  says to  Roderigo  I have rubb'd this  Gnat  almost to the Sense  And he grows angry  The common Editions give us the Lines in this Manner and Mr  Warburton  has done the same  Theobald  is the only Editor who saw the Absurdity  To rub a  Gnat  as he observes though ever so gently would rub it out of all Sense and would effectually kill it Yet though he perceived the Error it seems he knew not how to mend it The Quarto Editions Mr  Candid  told us instead of  Gnat  read  Quat  or  Quot  but  Theobald  continued he not knowing the Meaning of the Word alters it to  Knot  the Name of a Bird and has a long Note to justify the Correction But the old Books are perfectly right a  Quat  or  Quot  being a small Heat or Pimple which by itching provokes us to scratch it and when rubbed to the Quick or Sense it becomes hot and angry The Word has not perhaps the Authority of any contemporary Writer but must certainly be  Shakespear  's as it is still used in  Warwickshire  the native Country of the old Bard and in  Northamptonshire  where I passed a good many Months a few Years since it still carries with it the Meaning already assigned to it  Our Chairman ceased here and I apprehend that the communicating this Remark will be agreeable to all the Admirers of  Shakespear  and I am apt to think that many Passages of the Poet seemingly corrupted are to be illustrated not from Books but from the Customs and Dialect of the People many of the Terms which appear quite antiquated and obsolete being as I am informed still used in the Northern Parts of the Kingdom  Our Researches into Literature ended here and the Company immediately withdrew like satisfied Guests If my Readers should rise from the Perusal of this Lucubration with the same Relish I shall have gained the End proposed by this Account of our Transactions  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Extract of a Letter from  Dublin  Dear  CHARLES  YOU will undoubtedly be informed by the public Papers long before this can reach your Hands of the Conversion of that excellent Actress Mrs  Woffington  who is at present highly admired here for her admirable Performances Various are the Conjectures concerning the Motives which induced her to renounce the Errors of the Church of  Rome  but the most probable Opinion is that some eminent Lawyers advised her to this Step in order to qualify herself to wear a Sword in the Characters of Sir  Harry Wildair  and  Lothario  which she could not safely attempt as a Papist it being highly penal in this Kingdom for any one of the  Romish  Communion to carry Arms  Bedford Coffeehouse  Jan

Licentia sumpta pudenter  HOR  _MY Lucubration of last  Saturday  contained an Account of the Transactions of our Club and as an Incident offered after it broke up which gave Rise to the Speculation of this Day I beg that this Paper may be received as a Sequel to it  The Majority of our worthy Members returned home rather sooner than is usual with them at length Mr  Candid  and myself were the only Two remaining As we drew nearer to the Fire and to each other our Hearts began to throw off all Reserve and the  Conversation  which before was vague and upon general Topicks of Literature became gradually more confined and at length it centered wholly on ourselves Mr  Candid  amongst other Particulars began to congratulate with me on my Address and Reputation as a Writer and the Credit he was pleased to say I had acquired in conducting the Paper which bears my Name Your Reputation Mr  Ranger  says he is at present in its early Bloom the Aspect of the Public shines on you with a cheering Influence and Warmth But you are not to imagine it will be always thus The Sky may be overcast and the enlivening Radiance intercepted a chilling Frost may unexpectedly succeed and nip all your Blossoms in the Bud To drop the Metaphor  continued he the Countenance and Encouragement of the Public may be withdrawn and at a Time when you are exerting all your Talents to deserve and secure it Popular Favour and popular Prejudice are the most capricious Things imaginable Disgust will often arise where no Satiety has been given and mutual Confidence and good Liking will unaccountably degenerate to Coldness Suspicion and Indifference Yet it may be difficult to say from whence this Alteration is occasioned or whether it is owing to the Pretensions of the Writer or the Reader but in this Case perhaps as in most others there may be Faults on both Sides Exorbitant Claims are not so easily adjusted especially where the Parties are equally unwilling to recede from their presumptive Rights The Author is often unreasonable in his Demands for Fame and the Public as hard to be gratified in their Expectation of Pleasure You are at present considered as a new Writer the Delicacies you regale the Town with are a Dish unthought of by your FellowCaterers for the general Entertainment But these in Time will become familiar to our Taste your Wit will then be censured to have lost its Poignancy and your Humour its Relish I was going to make a suitable Reply to so obliging an Encomium when my Friend prevented me by observing that the Evening was now far advanced and that it became us as  Originals  not to prolong our Compotations to the modern Midnight Hours of Conversation  In retiring to my Chambers I could not forbear ruminating on the Sentiments of my penetrating Acquaintance and resolved to throw together a few Reflections upon what may be term'd  Novelty  in Writing  I think then that judicious Imitation either of antient or modern Standards ought not to be stigmatised as Larceny in an Author He is certainly at Liberty to  draw from any excellent Model whom he chuses to copy and that without incurring the ignominious Appellations of a Plagiary or Transcriber Universal Custom will justify the Practice All the imitative Arts may be more particularly termed so as the several Masters have frequently work'd after a Plan that was first sketched out by some eminent Example The same Design diversified indeed with newer Decorations as Genius or Invention prompted may be traced in the different Performances of subsequent Artists sometimes extended by the Addition of Circumstances which naturally grew out of the Work or contracted by pruning the luxuriant Branches and retrenching what appeared superfluous and unnecessary  This general and distant Imitation it will be readily owned is allowable and just is what cannot perhaps be easily avoided where the Subject is treated with Propriety and according to the Rules of Art Thus  Virgil  followed  Homer  thus  Addison  will always be regarded as the Pattern either of grave or of humourous Speculation and  Fielding  will ever be a faithful Guide to the Adventurer in comic Romance  But there is another Kind of Imitation which is more direct and literal and which consists in adopting the Sentiments and Phrase of others Of this the Legality is yet a Question and the Practice is generally judged to denote Poverty of Thought and Defect of Imagination in the Writer The Censure is perhaps too rigid or at least may be moderated by some qualifying Considerations that suggest themselves to our impartial Attention  The Transfusion of Wit from one Language to another when done with Elegance and Ease has been seldom turned to the Disparagement of the Author who has Abilities to do it when the Spirit is not suffered  to evaporate but retains all the Sprightliness and Vigour which it possess'd in the Original The Sentence which I have placed at the Head of this Paper is an Indulgence to an Author either for reviving obsolete and antiquated Expressions or for the Importation of new ones if the Liberty be used with Modesty and Discretion What  Horace  has thus observed with regard to Words only may be Parity of Reason be applied to Sentiment and Thought  If the Language is enriched by the Addition of a single Term or Phrase our Stock of Knowledge is made still more exuberant by introducing a Succession of new Ideas in Proportion as the Value of an Ingot is superior to a single Coin To discover a new uncommon Vein of Thinking upon ordinary and beaten Topics requires that creative Power of Imagination which Nature has imparted only to her Favourites and with a frugal sparing Hand Authors of inferior Genius have easier Methods assigned them in their Pursuit of Fame It must be their Merit to select the most agreeable and pleasing Imagery to give delicate and graceful Turns to obvious and common Thoughts and by this Means to recommend what is grown familiar to our Imagination by the Novelty and Advantage of its Dress A Statue which we have ceased to look on with the Eyes of Admiration when removed to another Point of View shall strike us with fresh Pleasure and Delight a Pleasure which results entirely from the Novelty and Change of its Position  There is a Couplet in  Pope  which I beg Leave to produce as applicable to the Sentiments advanced  True Wit is Nature to Advantage dress'd  What oft was thought but ne'er so well express'd  And this very Sentiment which I mention only as relative to the Subject and which on any other Occasion I should have industriously concealed our ingenious Poet has taken from a Remark of  Boileau  Writers who argue with Precision will often unavoidably fall into a Coincidence of Thought Nature and Truth are invariable and when several Pictures are taken of the same Object if they are just Copies of the Original they will necessarily have a Likeness to each other I might add likewise how difficult it is to offer what has not yet been said by any one on Subjects that appear exhausted  An humourous Acquaintance who often talks to me on this head lays it down as an indisputable Principle that Composition is only the Art of Stealing wisely And indeed as Matters are usually managed by our worthy Fraternity of Authors if we strike out the last Word his Definition is perfectly unexceptionable I make then no Scruple to declare that I look on all the Wit and all the Humour in antient or modern Languages as good and lawful Prize and that I shall freely convert them to my own Use and the Public Emolument But then I will take care to do it in such a Manner as shall reflect no Disgrace to the Author from whom I borrow it and that if he comes at any Time either in Person or by his Attorney to demand his Property he shall find it employed in the very Way which he himself would chuse  Having said this I give public Notice of this my Intention to Mr  Town  and all his Adherents and I advise them withal to keep a good Lookout in order to detect and expose me  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Bedford Coffeehouse  Feb  A New Sect of Philosophers has lately started up in this Place

of the Gospel Exhibition and they is to ponderate how far they agrees and the Negatives is to consider the same and by this Collision it is possible the Truth may be bolted out Pray be silent Gentlemen Hem Do you chuse to speak Sir  Oliver Cantwell  In handling this Argument Mr  President  I shall beg Leave to set out with what may seem not very apposite to the Purpose but it will lead into many Reflections which will appear not wholly foreign to the Point King  James  I was the worst Monarch that ever sat in the Throne of these Realms he was a pedantick grammatical pragmatical

and planetary  System Thirdly the Operations of the human Mind with our Ideas simple complex abstract and concreteWith Regard Sir to the first  Barclay  has the best Accoont and every one knows that the Sun was struck out of Chaos by the creative Mandate of the Almeety Fiat and sinally it is certain that Memory depends on our earliest Associations of Ideas which naturally evinces Deism and utterly discoontenances the Cause of Christianity which  certainly is not foonded on Argument  Mr  Locke  in his Chapter of innate Ideas  President  Your five Minutes are out Sir Time Sir do you chuse

hem I must observe Mr  President  that the Objections to Revelation arise from an Ignorance of the original Language in which it was  commocnicated  For Instance the Passage relating to  Jeptha  's Vow has been a great Fund of Raillery but when we take the full Force of the  Hebrew  Passage  Eama Jacabasa Irraurista Diarba Diota  I apprehend the Difficulty disappears I am glad to have this  Opportoonity  of correcting this Mistake which Gentlemen have gone into in opposing Revelation to  natooral  Religion  The Light of the Scriptures Mr  President  leads to the Improvement of  natooral

said of three Species the Flesh the Spirit and God's Grace and this I never told any body in my Life before and I now tell it in the Name of Charity to this good Assembly  Mr Sneerwell  Mr  President  I have little to offer at present only I must observe that we are all greatly obliged to the worthy Member who spoke last for his Information He tells us we are of three Species the Flesh the Spirit and God's Grace The  former of these he possesses very amply  viz  the Flesh but as to the Spirit and God's Grace he seems desitute of both for I believe if he had any Share of either he would not

Is there any Gentleman come in since this Debate that chuses to speak Pray Gentlemen be silent you'll please to take my Watch that I mayn't transgress my Time  The Affirmatives in this Question has endeavoured to invalidate the Gospel Exhibition but as one Gentleman has observed many Mistakes arises from the Ignorance of the  Hebrew  and to be sure we does he under that Disadvantage which is however in some Sort removed by the Notes in  Stackhouse  's Bible There is a Writer  Mounseer  DU PIN who though of the  Romish  Communion may be allowed sometimes to speak Truth though his Arguments often militates against himself and I does upon the whole apprehend that Revelation or the Gospel Exhibition like that glorious Luminary the Sun is of Divine Original  Time Sir  The Questions

Confusion and so the Scene ends  NUMB  GRAY'SINN  Saturday  March    Ut Pictura Poesis erit similisque Poesi  Sit Pictura refert par aemula quaeque sororum  FRESNOY's  Art of Painting  _POETRY and Painting have been accounted SisterArts by Men of Taste in all Ages and accordingly we find them both in the Writings of all good Criticks from  Aristotle  and  Horace  down to  Dryden  and the  Abbé du Bos  mutually borrowing Sidelights and reflecting Lustre upon each other They justly have the Precedence among the Arts of Imitation and Design as they convey their Ideas by Signs more fixed and determinate than any of the others and boast a more unbounded Scope to cull and select from all Nature in order to adorn and embellish the favourite Piece  I am aware that it may be said Statuary has very near the same Advantage and that the Artist in this Way may observe the Knitting of a Joint in one the Turn of a Neck in another the Form of the Head in a Third the Shape and Rounding of a Limb in a Fourth and that in short from a Survey of sundry Objects a complete and perfect Whole may be executed But it must be remembered at the same Time that Statuary has not so ample a Field to range in as the two firstmentioned and is therefore greatly inferior to both  Painting in one particular Instance seems to gain the Ascendant over Poetry being universally understood  in every Clime and every Age whereas the latter is confined to much narrower Limits both in Time and Place A  Raphael  painted and a  Vida  wrote at the same Period and how confined is the Reputation of the latter when compared to the extensive Renown which has attended the Name of the first through every Age and Country The Aera may arrive when through the Instability of the  English  Language the Stile of  Joseph Andrews  and  Tom Jones  shall be obliterated when the Characters shall be unintelligible and the Humour lose its Relish but the many Personages which the Mannerspainting Hand of  Hogarth  has called forth into mimic Life will not fade so soon from the Canvass and that admirable  Picturesque Comedy  the  March to Finchley  will perhaps divert Posterity as long as the  FoundlingHospital  shall do honour to the  British  Nation A Picture speaks the Language of every Nation and is universally felt and understood in many different Countries at the same Time in this Instance partaking the Advantages of MUSICK which is however subject to many Restrictions to which the Art of Painting is entirely a Stranger The Caprice and Whim of different Nations prevent the Power of Harmony from becoming so universal in its Influence for the primary Beauty of it consisting in an Imitation of the Sounds appropriated to our several Passions and those Sounds varying according to the Habits and Dialect of every different People it follows of Course that the Musick of any one Country must undergo many Changes and Variations before it can be adapted to the Ear of a Man who has resided for any Time in another Kingdom  This Inconvenience the Art of Painting is not subject to and in this Respect has the Advantage over Poetry though in almost every other Point it is obliged  to yield the Preeminence It has been long since observed that Truth is agreeable to the Understanding and fine Imagery to the Fancy but neither of them we find affords so intense a Pleasure as when the Passions are agitated and worked into a Ferment We then attach ourselves strongly to the Object which excites these Emotions we are pleased to be wakened from a State of still Life and it is a Gratification to our moral Sense to find our Hearts sensible and alive to those Sensations which are the Ornament of our Nature This being the Case I believe it may be asserted without incurring the Danger of a Controversy that Poetry boasts this Power over the Passions beyond any other Art at the same Time that it is a Vehicle for Instruction and derives much of its Beauty from the Scenes of picturesque Imagination Painting indeed partakes sufficiently of these Qualities to entitle her to the Name of Sister has many Features like and in the Execution of her Designs is mostly directed by the same Rules Both must have Unity of Action and Unity of Character and both have a Latitude to introduce subordinate Personages concerned in the main Business and to exhibit them in proper Attitudes A Metaphor may be as bold in Painting as in Poetry an Allegory may be as instructive and pleasing to the Fancy upon Canvass as in the written Page what the Critics call Machinery may be displayed in as elegant Strockes with the Pencil as with the Pen the Fairyway of Writing mentioned by  Dryden  may be made Use of in Colours and the Fancy of the Artist like a new Creation may start to the Eye an whole Race of imaginary Beings Some of the finest Passages in Epic and Dramatic Poesy are those where a Conflict is marked between several warring Passions Painting throws these immediately before the Eye and in Tints  artfully blended the nice Assemblage is delineated in the most striking Manner A further Instance of the Congruity between these two Arts is that when a Poet has been lavish in a Description the best Method of examining the Justness of it is to consider what Kind of Figure it would make upon Canvass and on the other Hand the Descriptions which we find in the Poets may serve to supply Hints and Instruction to the Painter of Taste and Poetick Imagination Add to this that as the chief Beauty of Poetick Diction does not consist in a Profusion of Ornaments high Metaphors and a Flourish of Words so in the other Colours too rich and glowing are disapproved and the Excellence of both Arts is seen in regular Designs and a just Imitation of Nature  The Ancients were enthusiastick Admirers of all the imitative Arts particularly Painting and upon all Occasions we find them expressing a Taste for the Productions of the famous Artists Accordingly their Poets seize every Opportunity of describing a Picture a Piece of Sculpture or any of the Works of the Loom  Ovid  never omits it where it naturally grows out of his Subject and  Virgil  never seems more delighted than when he is laying before our Eyes the Shield of  Aeneas  or like a skilful Virtuoso pointing out to our Observation the Beauties of a fine Painting  Artificumque manus inter se operumque laborem  Miratur  The Pleasure in this Case is  redoubled  upon the Mind springing from a twofold Source for the Delight we take in all poetick Description is chiefly owing to the natural Love we have for Imitation which affords an  Opportunity of comparing the Transcript with the original Object and when we peruse the Description of a Picture we admire not only the Poet's Representation of it but the Talent of the Artist who has thus contrived to delineate by his Pencil so exact a Resemblance of Things which have their Existence in Nature and thus the Mind has two Arts to examine at once and dwells between them both in a Suspense of Pleasure  I have always admired the Description in the first  Aeneid  of that exquisite Piece of Painting of the Wars at  Troy  and I think the Poet's Account of it may suggest to us some Notion of the sublime Ideas he entertained of the SisterArt of Poetry All the Figures which he mentions are bold and animated every Thing is in Motion and if I may be allowed to apply a Line of Mr  Pope  's  All Matter quick and bursting into Life  What an Image have we of the  Trojans  repelling the Enemy and of  Achilles  with his nodding Plume thundering at their Heels in his Turn You think you hear the Sounding of his Carr and you imagine you see him with his Arm aloft in Act to strike  Hac fugerent Danai premeret Trojana juventus  Hac Phryges  INSTARET CURRU CRISTATUS ACHILLES  The Situation of  Troilus  has been often admired and the Procession of the  Trojan  Nymphs will always excite the tenderest Sentiments and I dare affirm a finer Groupe was

and I am the more induced to this as my own Life will afford ample Room for Reflection  Without any further Detail you must know then Mr  Ranger  that I am the Son of a Tradesman in the West of

Byass to low Company you will imagine I must make but a very indifferent Figure in my new Station I was then two and twenty and had never been accustomed to any Kind of Intemperance and if my former Situation had enabled me to have been reckoned Company for the Gentlemen of the Place I might still have continued a sober Man but unhappily for me the Circumstance of my having been a Servant made me notwithstanding the Largeness of my Fortune shunned and despised and I was constrained to herd with my former Companions and others of better Substance but abandoned Morals with whom I soon acquired an Habit of Idleness and Debauchery by which in a few Years I found my ready Money exhausted To gratify the Extravagance of my Passions which were now become violent and unruly I was advised to take up some Money upon Part of my Estate and to this Purpose I applied to a neighbouring Lawyer who soon procured it for me As the Meanness of my Education had hindered me from knowing any Thing of Law Affairs I got my two Companions to overlook the Mortgage Deed and with their Advice signed it and they also set their Hands as Witnesses  Being now in Possession of seven Thousand Pounds I was advised by these my two Friends to see the World as they called it and accordingly I set out soon after with them for  London  leaving the aforesaid Lawyer to receive all my Rents in the Country You will naturally imagine Mr  Ranger  that in Town I tasted all the Pleasures it could give me I saw every Thing but still in the worst Company and was continually surrounded by a Set of Sharpers till having squandered away all my Money and got considerably in Debt I was arrested and sent to the  Fleet  In this Situation I directed my Lawyer to remit me some Money and the Arrest gave me no Concern as I made no Doubt of being quickly at Liberty but judge Sir my Surprize when I was informed that the Lawyer was in Possession of my whole Estate by an absolute Surrender from me which I had through Ignorance signed instead of a Mortgage deed and that my two Friends who had left me just before I was arrested appeared for the Attorney to witness the whole Transaction The Bitterness of this Calamity and the Consciousness of a mispent Life filled me with the severest Grief and would have entirely extinguished the Use of what little Reason I had but for the Charity of a FellowPrisoner who touched with a Sense of my Misfortunes not only did every Thing to alleviate them but infused such a Portion of Knowledge and Philosophy into my Mind during our long Imprisonment as must for ever render me sensible of his Kindness Let me finish the Account of my Life when I have told you that I was freed from my Imprisonment by the last Act of Grace and that with a moderate Sustenance procured by honest Industry I find myself more happy and contented now than when possessed of Affluence and a Mind immersed in Ignorance and Folly  As my Sisters received no better Education than myself I should tell you that notwithstanding their Fortune they are all come to Infamy and Poverty The Eldest soon after our Relation's Death married a Labourer to the Farmer she had lived with in the Station of Maid Servant and they have run through all they had The second was debauched by the Son of the Gentleman at whose House she had hired herself and is now in one of the Houses of bad Fame in  CoventGarden  the third married a Footman and died about two Years ago after having lived in great Distress and the fourth with Shame I speak it is now Mistress to the Earl of******  From this Account of myself and my Family I shall only draw one Inference that if the Relation who left us so liberally at his Death had but given us a good Education and behaved to us in his Lifetime agreeably to the Estate he intended to leave us the Misfortune we have met with might in all human Probability have been avoided and being connected by Marriage or otherways with Families of Credit and Reputation we might now remain in Affluence and enjoy a Name unsullied by Vice and Infamy I am  SIR  Your very humble Servant **** ******  The preceding Story is told by my Correspondent in so interesting a Manner that I could not withhold it from the Publick this Day and I not only agree with him in his Remark that his Misfortunes would all have been prevented by a proper Education but I will add that a Mind which supported itself so well  under Affliction and that can look back to former Scenes of Life with so much Sensibility would have imbibed such Impressions from an early Improvement as might have rendered him an Ornament to any Family If many of those who find any striking Incidents in the Series of their Lives would thus communicate them to the Public it would be a very great Service to Society as it would serve to detect the Ways of the World and might put the Unwary upon their Guard against illdesigning Men There is something extremely affecting in the Ruin of my Correspondent's four Sisters but I am however highly pleased that he now enjoys a Tranquillity of Mind and that to alleviate Calamity his Resources are in Virtue and honest Industry I must observe that the Inattention of the old Gentleman who died at  Bristol  to the Manners and Morals of his Relations shewed something in him highly illiberal not to give it a worse Epithet and it is owing to this Indifference to the Improvement of the rising Generation that we frequently see Estates in the Hands of those who are a Disgrace to Riches and while this continues to be the Case it is not to be wondered that we meet with so many Boobies of Fashion inelegant in their Behaviour loose in their Morals and fit to ride behind the Equipage in which their Pride now lolls at Ease  TRUE INTELLIGENCE

in the sixth  Aeneid  if a Man is born to share the Prize it is easily obtained but if there be not derived from Heaven a Superiority of Genius fruitless is the Endeavour of the unborn Poet who thinks to arrive at the Heights of Fame by painful Vigils and the Dint of Labour and Application A Mediocrity in Poetry will never be allowed  Horace  tells us that the Suffrages of both Gods and Men are against it and that a Writer of this Cast must never expect to see his Name on the Bookseller's RubrickPost Poetry requires warm and glowing Colours the Language of it must be elevated above the

cultivate these Qualities will be always sure to be neglected as a cold and spiritless Author  Of all the different Species of Poetry the Dramatic is the most difficult to succeed in and as it is expressed in the Words of my Motto those few only whom Heaven has peculiarly favoured with an Elevation of Mind have been able to acquit themselves with Honour Our much admired  Shakespear  stands yet unrivalled he seized the Laurel with a MasterHand at one Grasp  Johnson  by slower Degrees though eager in Pursuit  avidusque refringit cunctantem  and  Otway  seems to have gained it with Facility  I am pleased to find that an Author justly celebrated among the foremost Successors of these immortal Genius's has added another Wreath to that Garland which the Muses long since wove for him and in my Opinion the Public is greatly indebted to him for his  new Tragedy  of the  Brothers  which was lately acted for the first Time at  DruryLane  At the same Time that I advance this I must observe that the Subject of it is not perhaps as interesting to a  British  Audience as a more domestick Story and the Generality of People not being acquainted with the History of that Monarchy it thence results that the Distress of the King of  Macedon  does not engage our Passions so forcibly as might be expected It may be added that the  Macedonians  are supposed at that Point of Time to be at Variance with the  Roman  Empire for which we have contracted a kind of reverential Esteem and on this Account those sublime Sentiments which  Philip  utters in the Scene with the Ambassadors against that Republick are not received with a sufficient Degree of Warmth But if it be considered that the  Macedonian  Monarchy though it dwindled by insensible Degrees and was at last swallowed up  by the  Roman  Empire was at one Time the most flourishing in  Europe  I apprehend no Man can be entirely unconcerned in the Fall of so brave a People I do not doubt but the Mention of  Cressi  and  Poitiers  would have a more powerful Influence on the Passions of  Englishmen  than  Thrasymene  and  Cannae  but for my Part my Breast glowed to hear of those memorable Battles which had like to have been so fatal to the  Roman  Republick nor do I remember a grander Sentiment than that of  Philip  when the Flight of  Hannibal  at  Capua  is urged by the Embassy of  Rome  His Answer is  Ay there indeed I was not with him  The Scene which succeeds this is full of as tender Emotions as I have ever felt in any Theatre the Anguish of the Father to find a Discord subsisting between his Children and the Remonstrance with which he endeavours to sooth them must soften the Mind of every Hearer  Why do I sigh Do ye not know my Sons  And if you do Oh let me sigh no more  Let these white Hairs put in a Claim to Peace  Perhaps no Characters can be better marked than those of  Philip Perseus  and  Demetrius  for the two last of which we are finely prepared by the following Lines*  They both are bright but one  Benignly bright as Stars to Mariners  And one a Comet with malignant Blaze  Denouncing Ruin  The Art of most Writers for the Stage is to exhibit one Character and that perhaps without any distinguishing Qualities to separate it from other Heroes but in this Play we are entertained with three of a different  Cast and each strongly marked  Philip  is distinguished by a Warmth of Temper an Haughtiness of Soul and a Tenderness for his Children that runs over in the most affecting Manner  Perseus  is a different Villain from any we have seen on the Stage Policy and Bravery are so blended in him that we see their mixed Effects in every Scene and  Demetrius  is of so amiable a Disposition that an Audience must be naturally inclined to love him and for his Sake to dread the restless turbulent Spirit of  Perseus  whose Contempt of  Demetrius  vents itself in a sneering artful Strain  You that admire the  Romans  break the Bridge  With  Cocles  or with  Curtius  leap the Gulph  And league not with the Vices of our Foes  I hear Sir you take Wing and mount in Metre  Terence  has own'd your Aid  Terence  there the Slave  The Invocation which is uttered by the same

 c  It will be unnecessary to remind my Readers of the TrialScene which must inevitably fire the intelligent Mind with a classic Warmth I cannot help thinking that the Author in this Passage has given a just Idea of the two different Kinds of Eloquence which prevailed in  Greece  and  Rome  Perseus  enters immediately into the Matter his Sentences are strong and nervous and sure of convincing the Understanding by the Clearness of his Diction he does not condescend to address the Imagination It is true he at one Time sheds Tears but that is only to obviate the Power of Eloquence which he is aware might be used by his Brother who having imbibed the Art of  Roman  Oratory sets out in the most insinuating Manner tries the Avenues to the Passions and endeavours to win his Hearers by Persuasion I am sensible that this Beauty may escape the Multitude but even without this secondary Pleasure the Scene cannot sail of striking every Imagination  The Distress of  Demetrius  in the fourth and fifth Act bears hard upon our Affections and it must be a Torture to every compassionate Heart to see him undone by the Artifices of Villainy His Speech when discovered in Gaol has many affecting Strokes  Ye Dungeons deep ye subterranean Caves  Guilt's first sad Stage in her dark Path to Hell  Receive a Guest arriv'd from other Scenes  From pompous Courts  c  And when he lies dead on

trivial Circumstance which could have the least Tendency to excite their Mirth and I must inform them that to be unsusceptible of manly Emotions and at the same Time to yield to the idle Sensations of Levity and giddy Merriment is the Sign of a little and frivolous Mind  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  From my Register Office  March    WE can assure the Public that the following is a true Copy of the famous

Marriages we presume to remonstrate that if the said Bill should pass into a Law it must inevitably be attended with the most destructive Consequences to your Petitioners A  British  House of Commons cannot be ignorant that Gaming to which your Petitioners have been bred is an Introduction  into all the polite Families within the Cities in  London  and  Westminster  by which easy Means of Access many worthy Gentlemen distinguished by the Appeliation of  Chevaliers de l'Industrie  have frequently been able privately to convey an Heiress either to  MayFair  or the  Fleet  and thereby acquire an ample Fortune Now your Petitioners humbly apprehend that they shall be precluded this Advantage by the bill now depending in your Honourable House for should it be necessary to render a Marriage valid that a Licence must be granted in the Presence of the Parties Parents or next Relations it is much to be feared that a Citizen of  London  ignorant of the gay World may not pay a due Regard to the Distinctions of a laced Coat and smartcocked Hat whereby your Petitioners will be under an absolute Necessity of obtaining the Consent of such a Wordling who will probably from a Narrowness of thinking acquired by pecuniary Transactions imagine that we are not entitled to a Fortune because we have none of our own Now we beg Leave to suggest that should we be deprived of this valuable Branch of our Profession Necessity which supersedes all Law may compel us to go on the Highway the Effects of which may be so fatal to the good People of  Great Britain  that undoubtedly an  English

controul myself from laying it before my Readers with a few of those Reflexions which arose in my Mind in Consequence of it  To  CHARLES RANGER  Esq  Dear Sir  _I NOW take up the Pen to own the Receipt of your last Favour with the  Gray'sInn Journal  inclesed I cannot at present prevail upon myself to return you an Answer in Form as my Thoughts are entirely engrossed by an unhappy Event which I am persuaded will affect your Mind very greatly Our once worthy Friend  Jack  ***** Yesterday Evening after having passed the Time with his usual Alacrity of Spirit went Home to his Lodging and clapping a Pistol in his Mouth  shot himself through the Head The Noise alarmed the Family who instantly went up Stairs and found him dead I shall write to you more at large very shortly and must beg Leave for the present without adding any Thing farther to subscribe myself  Dear Sir  Yours with great Sincerity *****  The gloomy Month of  November  being passed I imagined that the horrid Crime of Suicide would cease at least till the Return of that heavy Time of the Year It is certainly a poor Desertion from the Dignity of our Nature to suffer the Pressure of the Atmosphere or any other sublunary Incident to make such an Impression upon our Spirits as to render us avowed Enemies to ourselves I have heard a popular Insurrection called an unnatural Rebellion but by what Name shall we stigmatize an Action which flies in the Face of our Maker which dares to thwart the Dispensations of the supreme Being and say to eternal Providence who from the first ordained all Things for the best  "NOT THINE BUT MY WILL BE DONE"  It requires no Profusion of Imagery no bold daring Metaphor no studied Hyperbole to represent this Piece of Impiety in its proper Colours it strikes the Eye at once in its most flagrant atrocious Dye and were it sufficiently attended to it would teach a due Resignation to the Determinations of Heaven and would prevent all that Train of Evils from which any thinking Mind must now start back appalled  If SelfPreservation is the nearest Principle to the Heart of Man what a Perversion of our Faculties of our Reason and our Judgment must usurp the Mind of him who thus runs counter to the very End of his Creation The Dignity of the human Soul is extinguished not only his Power of Reflexion is suppressed but his very Passions are thrown off their Byass they are seduced from their original Institution their Nature Use and End is perverted and what before sought real or apparent Pleasure and avoided actual or imaginary Pain now by a strange Fatality seeks its own Destruction Anarchy and Civil War disturb the Imagination and the Man bears his own secret Enemy in his Breast he forms a Design upon his own Life he has the Air drawn Dagger constantly before his Eyes and he at length becomes his  own Macheth  Not even the bloody Purposer of determined Vengeance on another's Head horrid as the Crime appears is half so astonishing because he does not carry with him half the Absurdity The latter has Time left him to atone by Penitence for his Barbarity whereas the Suicide urges precipitantly to the Tribunal of his offended God  The real Source of this fatal Evil is perhaps hard to be ascertained but if it is not originally an Emanation from Pride it is tinged with it so strongly that there is Reason to conclude it is frequently derived from thence Self Love will always induce us to overrate our Rank in the Scale of Beings and when once the Imagination is struck with the Idea of fancied Importance each little Trial of Adversity is considered as a Grievance intolerable it is too much for the Man to bear he concludes himself a destined Mark for Affliction and rather than drag a feverish Life under an  huge Load of Misery he proudly resolves to put an End to his Sufferings and measure out the Thread of his own Existence  For my own Part I cannot look upon any Contingence in this World of Consequence sufficient to urge a Man to this Extreme of Madness Is he reduced to Want by his inordinate Expences or do the Narrowness of Circumstances prevent him from emerging into that Station of Life which his Ambition would aspire toLet him but examine the Happiness of the Affluent how many want with a full Purse how many are tortured with Diseases or eaten up with uneasy Passions Have a Man's Relations unworthily withdrawn their Protection from him there are Occupations enough in which he may endeavour to support himself without their Assistance and then he will have the Satisfaction of living independent of those who have deserted him and should he fail his honest Indigence will at all Times be a Disgrace to them so that either Way he will be a living Affront to his false Friends  In so polite an Age it may not be proper to corroborate what has been advanced by Arguments drawn from Religion but if an Heathen may have any Weight in the Affair I would inform the Man of Despair that  Plato  and  Cicero  were both of Opinion that we are placed in this World as Soldiers upon Duty and that no one has a Right to move without the Summons of his commanding Officer and  Virgil  in the Words of my Motto tells us that there is a Place of Retribution for those unhappy Wretches who dare to lay violent Hands upon themselves and prodigal of Life to precipitate their Souls into Eternity They would be glad continues the Poet to bear Poverty and the sharpest Miseries could they again return to  Life but the Fates forbid them and their Passage is irremeable  To these Authorities I would beg Leave to add the Sentiment of our great  Shakespear  who though he may be justly suspected of Christianity was still a Poet and therefore may be cited on this Occasion He has introduced a young Prince deliberating whether he should not extricate himself from the Troubles of this World by boldly putting an End to his Residence on this Side of the Grave The Point is argued with great Strength of Reasoning the Calamities of this Life are thrown into the Scale and after stating every Thing in the most striking Colours a Prospect of Futurity opens to the Imagination and the Mind starts back from the desperate Act convinced that it is our Duty to endure Life and bear our Portion with Fortitude until Heaven shall be pleased to put in Execution that Sentence of Death which it has passed on all Mankind  Who wou'd Fardels bear  To sweat and groan under a weary Life  But that the Dread of something after Death  That undiscover'd Country from whose Bourne  No Traveller returns puzzles the Will  And makes us rather bear those Ills we have  Than to fly to others that we know not of  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  To  CHARLES RANGER  Esq  SIR  FROM a Motive of Gratitude and for the Benefit of my Countrymen in general I

who had himself experienced it advised me to have Recourse to the reading of the  Inspector  's Papers I accordingly took one of them over Night and the Consequence was I fell into a profound Sleep which lasted near six and thirty Hours Since that I have been ordered for fear of a Lethargy to take them in smaller Quantities A Paragraph at a Time now answers my Purpose and under Heaven I owe my sleeping Faculties to the abovementioned  Inspector  I look upon them to be a grand  Soporificum mirabile  proper to be had in all Families He makes great Allowance to those who buy 'em to sell again

Visit to a Lady for whom I have always had a very great Respect An Excursion which she made into the Country was the Occasion of my not having seen her for some Time but upon the first Notice of her being in Town I immediately did myself the Favour of waiting on her It was with great Satisfaction that I perceived her Complexion florid to the highest Degree of Health As I knew she had two Sons at  Eton  School I enquired after the young Gentlemen and received for Answer that the Brats were minding their Books  Boys Mr  Ranger  said she are best when out of one's Way they make such a Noise in an House that there is really no such Thing as bearing with them I hope they are going on well But Sir you don't know all my Family  Upon this she rung the Bell and ordered the Servant to bring down Miss  Lucy  and Miss  Charlotte  and then continued Mrs  Bizarre  they are both quite jealous of one another Miss  Lucy  has taken a Notion into her Head that  Charlotte  is my Favourite and  Charlotte  equally suspects my Propensity to  Lucy  but upon my Word it is without Foundation I give them no Manner of Reason well now I think it would be quite wrong in me to make any Difference when they are both deserving I vow and protest I love them both alike I can't think how some Folks can be soto be sure it's  very commonly the Cause of great Uneasiness in a Family and the little Things are unhappy in their Minds Lard I wonder what keeps them above so long  When on a sudden the Parlour Door was thrown open and as I did not recollect that Mrs  Bizarre  had any Daughters I advanced with some Degree of Impatience to salute the young Ladies but to my great Surprize the Maid introduced to me two very ugly Monkeys dressed out in the nicest Manner with  Paris  Caps and well chosen Petonlair and Petticoat  The Disappointment I met with flung me into some Confusion and I retired back in a very aukward Manner to my Chair  There Mr  Ranger  reassumed the Lady this is Miss  Lucy  and this is Miss  Charlotte  Pray Sir don't you think they have very pretty turned Faces there's a Family Likeness between them I think they are the only Comfort I have Pray  Molly  did Miss  Lucy  take the Manna as the Doctor ordered Lord I was frighted out of my Wits Yesterday the poor thing was so terribly pained with the Cholic and Miss  Charlotte  has been coughing all the Morning I hope it won't fall upon her Lungs they are the sweetest Creatures in the World Where's your Curtsey Miss when a Gentleman speaks to you She is absolutely Mr  Ranger  the greatest Prude in  London  She quarrels with the Maid if she but leaves her Breast the least uncovered and you know the Fashion is now to shew as low as one possibly can and her Sister there Miss  Charlotte  she is the violentest Coquet in Nature  Molly  give that Fan See how she handles it Soft Affectation plays about her twisted Neck as it's in the Play don't you think she has fine Eyes Well did you ever see such a pretty little Mouth  and the finest Teeth I am afraid she is a little inclined to be sat She'll never be taller Lard Mr  Ranger  I wish I could get her a Husband I should be glad to see her well settled he he he Now I have a queer Notion in my Head Do you know that I have a Husband in my Eye for her Guess who it is  To this I took Occasion to answer that there are really so many pretty Gentlemen about Town that it would be absolutely impossible for me to form a right Conjecture and I therefore begged she would be so kind as to inform me  Why Sir replied she there is  Tom Titmouse  that is always biting his Lips and never has a Bit of his Shoe seen above his Buckle and  Billy Wirewig  who always stinks of Perfume or  Jemmy Doll  with the delicate Complexion and the little mincing Step but it is not any of them O fie the Frights do you think I would accept of any of 'em I assure you Sir I refused a much better Offer I could have had Captain  Jessamy  of the Guards but I have a finer Thought in my Head now Was you ever at  Mother Midnight  's To be sure you was he he he Well for certain I am a comical Woman You remember the pretty dear Creature that sits at Supper on the right Hand he he he it came into my Mind the Moment I saw the dear Fellow that it would be a good Match and so now as I don't know where to send I have drawn up an Advertisement which I intend to put into the Papers here you may read it Sir  This I complied with it was in Substance as follows  If the Monkey that sat on the right Hand at  Mother Midnight  's and drank a Glass of Wine after bowing to the Company has no Aversion to Matrimony  he is desired to call at  MayFair  Chapel and he will hear of something to his Advantage  Upon Perusal of this extraordinary Advertisement I endeavoured to expostulate with the good Lady on the Oddity of her Proceeding and I remonstrated that it would appear to the World the most whimsical Thing that was ever practised Irritated at this Mrs  Bizarre  could not bear to be touched in so tender a Point and she told me with some Vehemence that Monkeys have often more Sense than many of the human Species and I believe the Dispute would have rose high between us had not an Accident put an End to it  While we were engaged in Conversation a Quarrel happened between the two young Ladies and in a Moment Miss  Lucy  tore off Miss  Charlotte  's Cap which Compliment was returned in Kind and then the Battle was carried on with great Eargerness on both Sides attended with violent Screamings with bouncing about the Room leaping on Chairs and Tables and flying violently in our Faces All the Ornaments on the Mantlepiece were broke to Shatters the China Figures which before seem'd to breathe and think came trembling down  Woodward  and Mrs  Clive  who represented in exquisite  ChelseaWare  their different Characters in  Lethe  shared the general Wreck Mrs  Bizarre  's Face was scratched in several Places and she also lost in the Fray a very elegant Pair of  Dresden  Rustles  Prudence directed me to escape from this strange Scene with the utmost Expedition and as soon as I found myself in my Chambers I could not help reflecting on the whimsical Turn of Mind which disposed this Lady to fix her Heart on such a disagreeable Race of Animals When a Woman becomes an Apostate from the Laws of Nature and divests herself of the proper  Ornaments of her Sex she is as great an Exotick as any in her Collection of wild Beasts I believe the Pangs of Jealousy would be much keener in an Husband's Breast were he to find himself rivalled by a Monkey and for such a Set of odious Creatures to see a Person neglect her own Children is so fantastical a Circumstance that some of my Readers may perhaps think the Existence of such a Character improbable but I can assure them that there are frequent Instances of it in this Town  To regulate and govern the Imagination is recommended by a  Greek  Philosopher as a Point of Moment in the Conduct of Life and most assuredly the Rule is excellent The Imagination is the liveliest Faculty of the Soul and gives to all Objects the Hue and Colour which they seemingly wear and we love and hate hope and fear according to the Scenes which are pictured to our Fancy It is this which makes  Quixotilla  call aloud for a Cork and under a due Government is the Source of that sprightly Taste and just Sense of Things which is remarkable in  Angelica  it is this which gives new Graces to her Beauty irradiates her whole Countenance and in all Scenes and Circumstances of Life renders her the most amiable of her Sex  To cultivate therefore and cherish the natural Affections to direct them to worthy Objects to keep them all in Harmony so that not one of them shall grow out of due Proportion or contract any whimsical Habit is the best Preserver and Beautifier of the female Form it gives that pleasing Turn of Mind which we call Sweetness of Temper prevents Wrinkles Distortion of the Features and gives an agreeable Air to the whole Person as a few of the Sex have experienced and as such it is this Day recommended to all the female Readers of this Paper  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Court of Censorial Enquiry  March    ON  Wednesday  last

every Age ready to insult defenceless Wit to pull it by the Nose or oblige it to endure the Discipline of the Toe I have been punctually three Times a Week at a celebrated Fencing School in order to perfect myself in the noble Science of Defence The Master of this Place understands the Method of killing as well as any Gentleman of the Faculty but his Temper of Mind renders him less inclinable to put it in Practice he allows me to be a very good Figure on the Ground says I stand an excellent Attitude and adds that when I bring myself to do Things not so much in an Hurry I shall sence as well as any angry Boy in  England  I must own that I am apt to advance and retreat in too precipitate a Manner and this Exercise throws my Spirits into such a Flurry that I sometimes cannot avoid doing Mischief I have already put out a Gentleman's Eye dislocated three of another's Teeth and broke my Foil upon the small Ribs of a Third and if I proceed in this Manner I begin to be apprehensive about the Consequences which may arise from unforeseen Accidents and therefore I am now determined to entrench myself from Insults within one of the Resolutions which  I entered into upon the Commencement of this Paper  viz  not to deserve Ill of any Man  It would be well if all the Individuals of Society would enter into a reciprocal Agreement of observing the same Principle in their Deportment we might then see that Harmony subsist which as sociable Beings it is our Business to promote this would banish all surly Moroseness and in short this single Rule of deserving I'l from no Man would prevent all Indecorums and Animosities and substitute in their Room mutual Considence and Goodbreeding  But the contrary occurs every Day and seems to be derived from no other Source than a vicious Gratification of our private Humours A selfish Spirit is condemned in Ethics as the Cause of many Vices and it is of no less evil Influence in the  Petites Morales  or  lesser Morals  When a narrow Regard to a Man's own Sensations gains the Ascendant and none will recede from their equal Right of having their own Way it is not to be wondered that ill Humours should sour the Temper and that frequent Quarrels should arise  Philipsus  has taken it into his Head that to be brisk and shining in Conversation is the most elegant Accomplishment he can aspire to and therefore has spent most of his Time in the Acquirement of something that he calls Wit but in the Eyes of Men of Sense is only a petulant Pertness very annoying to his Company  Philipsus  has laid it down as a Maxim that he must upon all Occasions display his favourite Talent and would rather at any Time lose his Friend than his Joke  Antiphaus  is an absolute Enemy to all Pretensions to be shining Conversation with him must be in a plain sensible Manner he will neither give nor take a Joke hence these two are constantly at Variance  and it is imagined by their Friends that the Affair must be at last decided behind  MontagueHouse  For my Part I have often wondered how Men can be such Enemies to their Pleasures as to be thus obstinately bent on the Indulgence of their own private Whimsies without abating any Thing from their Pretensions in order to contribute to the Felicity of their Neighbours The social Passions afford more real Delight than any selfish Gratifications the latter are sure to Occasion a Narrowness of Spirit while the former expand the Faculties of the Mind and receive Addition from being communicated like the Sun painting the Hemisphere with Streaks of Light which serve to adorn his Way and augment the Glory of his Career In a State of mutual Dependance which Nature has allotted to us all it is not to be imagined that any one will pay the least Deference to our Ease and Happiness unless in our Turn we recede a little from our own Humours and purchase by our Deportment that Complacence which every one desires to meet with in his Intercourse with Society  But as this Restraint upon our Conduct seems to be too much thrown off it is not to be wondered that frequent Recourse is had to Duelling to decide Differences between those who have renounced the Guidance of Reason which would surely forbid us to squander away the Life bestowed upon us by the supreme Being upon such trivial Incidents as for the most Part occasion these Extremities The  Romans  knew nothing of this modern Practice which is entirely of  French  Growth and like many of the Fashions of that Country should be exploded from all civilized Nations It may not be improper to cite the Definition of Courage from so fine a Gentleman  as Mr  Addison  In his elegant Poem entitled the  Campaign  he tells us  True Courage dwells not in a troubled Flood  Of mounting Spirits and fermenting Blood  Lodg'd in the Soul by Virtue overrul'd  Insiam'd by Reason and by Reason ccol'd  I never yet heard of an Affair between two Gentlemen according to the polite Phrase but one or both of them was egregiously in the Wrong and I persuade myself that if indead of determining wilfully to support Matters of no Moment People could be brought to canvass their Differences with some Degree of Temper and Chearfulness we should not often have Advices from  Morybone Fields  or any of the usual Scenes of Action upon these Occasions To evince this I shall conclude with the following Story I was once in Company at a Tavern with a Set of Gentlemen when after much Mirth and Festivity one of the Party who had been silent almost the whole Night accosted a Gentleman who had contributed greatly to our Entertainment by a lively Vein of Fancy peculiar to him in the following Words  Sir says he taking him by the Button I have something to communicate to you I have observed Sir that you have been very facetious all Night you have run your Rig upon me Sir and so I desire you will meet me Tomorrow Morning in  Pancras  BuryingGround  A Blood of the Town would perhaps have been fired at this Proposal but my Friend received it with great Composure and while the rest of the Company were struck dumb at the Solemnity of the Challenge he turns to him with a Mixture of Jest and Earnest in his Countenance and whispers  in  Pancras  Burying Ground Sir  Yes Sir in  Pancras  Burying  Ground without fail  Very well Sir  must I bring my Shroud with me  The Pleasantry of this Question excited a general Laugh in the Room and the solemn Gentleman could not resist the Impulse of Mirth he joined in the Chorus and as soon as he recovered from his Fit of Merriment exclaimed "You're a brave Boy give us your HandI'll never meet you but on a Party of Pleasure and to that you may command me whenever you please"  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  DruryLane  April    THIS Morning about the Time of Rehearsing a Caravan extraordinary

Excess of Goodness we presume Sir to lay before you a Grievance which we unhappily labour under Our malignant Stars Sir and our more cruel Fathers combine to tie us down to the Drudgery of Business to which our Genius is no Way adapted on the contrary we are ambitious of shining in a more polite Sphere and have demonstrated our Attachment to your ancient House upon every Occasion of a Riot or any other Attempt to disturb the Tranquillity of your Government but being compelled to reside at the Distance of near an Hour's Drive from the Theatre we find it impossible to get into the Pit after Dinner whereby we are deprived of at least three Meals in a Week from which Hardship we hope to be relieved by your publishing an Edict importing that after this Season the Doors shall not be opened until Five of the Clock In full Confidence of Redress we conclude sincerely wishing that you may continue to display your usual Graces of Elocution and admirable Powers of Action untill  Harlequin  shall dethrone the great  Shakespear  or  Pierot  usurp the Seat of  Johnson  To which the Manager was pleased to return the following most Gracious Answer  Gentlemen  I return you Thanks for this obliging Address and shall always pay the greatest Deference to the Remonstrances of the City of  London  but as all Innovations are of dangerous Tendency I must take a few Days to consider this

content to have enjoyed the intellectual Pleasures immediately arising from the Beauty of external Objects or the transient Scenes of Life it frequently when they have vanished and disappeared makes fond Excursions after them again and even in our Sleep it will occasionally recall the Objects of our waking Reflection and from thence receive livelier Sensations than were perhaps occasioned by the first Impression Though there are many fantastic Circumstances in these Night Thoughts if I may be so allowed to call our Dreams yet on these Occasions we sometimes find ourselves presented with agreeable Visions and amidst the wildest Vagaries of Fancy we can often trace something like just Reasoning and a real Picture of Life As I take this to have been the Case with me a few Nights since I shall make no Apology for throwing my Dream upon Paper this Day  I found myself on a sudden near a large intricate Wood which I had the Curiosity to enter A whimsical band of Hope and Fear Joy and Grief Pain and Pleasure hovered over our Heads Tender Anguish soft Desire pleasing Agony were all intermixed and in their motley Livery formed a manycoloured  Groupe  Cupid  made violent Work with his Darts and Flames and nothing was to be heard but tinkling Rills falling Fountains and lovesick Sighs by which the Aspen Leaves were perpetually kept in a rustling Tremor The God of Love had by him a prodigious Quantity of Arrows differently feathered according to the various Effects of which they were to be productive This Circumstance called to my Mind a beautiful Passage in a Poem by Doctor  Parnell  And ev'ry Dart can boast a Kind  Which suits each proper Turn of Mind  From the tow'ring  Eagle's  Plume  The  generous Hearts  accept their Doom  Shot by the  Peacock  's painted Eye  The vain and  airy Lovers  die  For  careful  Dames and  frugal  Men  The Shafts are speckled by the  Hen  The  Pyes  and  Parrots  deck the Darts  When  Prattling  wins the panting Hearts  When from the  Voice  the Passions spring  The warbling  Finch  affords a Wing  Together by the Sparrow stung  Down fall the  Wanton  and the  Young  And fledg'd by  Geese  the Weapons fly  When others love they know not why  It was not unpleasant to observe the Variety of Impressions that were occasioned in both Sexes by this strange Flight of Arrows Men I perceived in close pursuit of blooming Virgins merely from the impulse of Vanity and I saw several Nymphs running with the utmost Precipitation from their Lovers though by their Manner of looking back and the rustling they made in the Trees there was room for Conjecture that they did not desire entirely to escape  Pleasing as the Sensations of Love are I could observe that very unhappy Effects were often the Consequences Many there were whose Mien spoke a Dejection of Spirits and they were frequently driven to such Extremes that they laid violent Hands on their own Lives As I travelled on I saw several hanging on Bows of Trees and on the Waters which were swelled with Tears and ruffled with Sighs floated many a pallid  Corpse  in their Countenances I could plainly see the Traces of that sickly Luxury of Thought which is so apt to settle into a fixed Despair  From this Scene of Distress I turned away as soon as possible and was relieved from my Uneasiness by the Sight of a few who seemed to be happy in their Passion whose Hearts felt a mutual Warmth and whose Eyes were brightened into Gladness They walked Arm in Arm down the flow'ry Meads interchanging mutual Glances of Affection though ever and anon succeeded Anger Suspicion open War and Peace again In the Center of the Wood stood a Temple sacred to VIRTUE where all who were desirous of leading a Life of Happiness were directed to bend their Course in Order there to be united together in Bands of chaste Affection I was sorry to find that some of the Ladies had not Resolution to persevere in this Path Whether it was owing to loose Desires or seducing Temptation I cannot decide certain it is they tired in their Journey and stepped aside with their Paramours to sequestred Bowers from whence they were afterwards discarded into the thorny Parts of the Wood for the Remainder of their Days but even of these a few there were who after their Digression still found Means to be introduced into the Temple whither they were however pursued by an old Hag called SCANDAL who never yet has been known to let them entirely efface the Remembrance of their Error  The Ladies who kept on a due Course never failed to lead the Men in Captivity after them to the Temple from whence after a short Ceremony they were dismissed in Pairs to commence the Road for Life Three different Paths were open to their Choice and a Guide stood at each Entrance to receive them The first was of a cold dispassionate Temper who took every Thing alike and his Name was INDIFFERENCE The second had Eyes of a greenish Cast and he seemed to loath the Food which he notwithstanding eagerly swallowed This Personage was called JEALOUSY and the third by an Openness of Countenance a strong Expression of quick Sensibility and cordial Affection was known to be FRIENDSHIP Too many gave themselves up to INDIFFERENCE and instantly an Inattention to each other's Wants succeeded in their Breasts the Men betook themselves to Midnight Shouts and Revelry and the Fair to Parties of Tea and Routs and Drums by which Means every spark of Love was soon extinguished and the Gratification of their own separate Inclinations was their only Study  The Walks of JEALOUSY were craggy dangerous and steep full of Thorns Briars and Brambles In the Heart where before Gladness and Joy revelled secure arose Anxiety Distrust and Perturbation of Spirit The distempered Fancy started at Scenes of its own Creation and in a Fit of Madness hurried many a tortured Wretch down the Precipice of Fate or let fall its Vengeance on its Neighbour What was observable in this Part was that though sometimes there were the Appearances the real Footsteps of Guilt could no where be discovered  The very small Number under the Guidance of FRIENDSHIP enjoyed a pure heartfelt Tranquillity and the fierce Desire and impatient Wish which had formerly actuated their Minds having now subsided a steady and uniform Flame succeeded not unlike the  mild refreshing Air of a placid Evening after the Fervor of an hot Summer's Day Glad Suns rose over their Heads and kindly Nights lulled them in each other's Arms A smiling Race grew up around them and the Culture of their young and tender Minds afforded a pleasing Employment they journey'd on thro' Life blessed with the Sunshine of the Soul till at length the easy Dissolution of Nature put a Period to all human Felicity  Here I could not help exclaiming with the Poet  O grant me thus to live and thus to die  Who sprung from Kings shall know less Joy than I  The whole Scene appeared so completely happy that I began to feel some Approaches towards Envy

solo caput inter nubila condit  VIRGIL  _THERE are few Terms which are applied with greater Impropriety than those characteristical Appellations which Men usually bestow on their Acquaintance or on others in whose Company and Conversation they may at any Time have been casually engaged Every Character indeed is formed by the Prevalence of some particular Passion which influences the Temper and gives a casting Weight to the Genius of the Person in whom it subsists But no Rules that I know of have been yet laid down nor is there any certain Standard which should fix the Degree of Elevation to which the ruling Passion must necessarily rise before it can have Strength sufficient to determine the Character  The Reader must however be informed that I am not speaking of those moral Qualifications or Endowments  of the Heart which speculative Writers have taken so much idle Pains to adorn and recommend and which Men of Sense or Men of the World have unanimously agreed in rejecting as unworthy of their serious Notice The Qualities I mean are pure Virtues of the Head or Face Properties which enable the Possessor to assume a solemn Aspect at Incidents which set the rest of the Table on a Roar or to interrupt what is truly serious and grave by impertinent Questions of Levity and Mirth or lastly to condemn and cavil when all the World sees the highest Reasons for Applause and Admiration The Effects which these Causes produce in Life however various and complicated in their Appearance may be reduced to the three general Sources of Wit Humour and Criticism and as the Pretenders to these several Qualities are infinite in Number I have determined on a certain Standard in order to regulate and adjust their Claims The Method I propose is to decide their different Pretensions by the Height and Stature of the Body  And lest this should be considered as a wild chimerical Design I must beg Leave to assure my Reader that the Theory I am forming is built upon the latest Discoveries and most uncontroverted Principles of true Philosophy It is possible however that Persons of an overrefining Curiosity may be able to raise some Objections to what I am going to advance but as every Thing is liable to be called in Question by those who are disposed to cavil they will give me but little Pain upon that Head The plainest Truths have been disputed and the most extravagant Opinions have been fortunate enough to meet with their Advocates and Admirers Now I would have such People recollect what are the general Apprehensions arising in the Mind on the Sight of an uncommon Stature and how favourable withal even the Notions of the Vulgar are to an unusual Height of Person Is it not commonly supposed  that Men of this superior Eminence possess as superior Parts and extraordinary Degrees of Merit From this Principle my little Friend of  DruryLane  is universally censured as falling short of a true Hero by near half a Foot whilst his more aspiring Antagonist is allowed to have all the necessary Dimensions required both by ancient and modern Precedents to constitute the heroic Character  It is an Axiom in Philosophy which few I hope will be so hardy as to deny that the Soul is all and all in every Part From hence it is obvious that the Body which is a Covering only for the Aetherial Particle that is lodged within it must necessarily receive its Dimensions from the Vigour of the Spirit which actuates the exterior Frame The greater Portion of Fire this Spirit is endued with its elastic Qualities will be proportionably stronger and the Dimensions of the Body will be protruded to a Size exactly of the same Dimensions with the Soul which informs it On this simple Hypothesis which I imagine cannot be easily disproved I proceed to settle the respective Qualifications of the different Pretenders who have been mentioned above  In the first Place those who with gentle  William  in the Play boast themselves not on Account of their Wisdom but as they have a  pretty Wit  do not exceed the lowest Degree of our appointed Standard It is not in Nature that such Persons can rise in their Stature above the Height of five Feet and six Inches For Wit which is merely an Exercise of the Tongue doth not require the same Bulk and Dimensions which are essential to Qualifications of a superior Order It is evidently a much less Exertion of the interior Faculties than what are productive of that Talent which we call Humour Hence we must advance a little in our Standard and can admit no one to be a Man of real Humour who does not come up to the full Height of five Feet and eight Inches and this small Progression is the  more allowable as a considerable Part of Humour is frequently expressed by such Feats of Body as require some little Degree of Size and Strength Giving a Friend a violent and unexpected Slap upon the Back or the dexterous Leaping over Chairs and Tables have been often regarded as so many undoubted Signs of genuine Humour and are generally agreed to denote a most facetious Vein of Pleasantry in the Authors of such exquisite Jokes It will sometimes further happen that these two Qualities may be blended in the same Person as I doubt not but many of my Readers can recollect several of their Acquaintance who are your only Men of Wit and Humour Now this Conjunction manifestly implies a much superior Energy of Soul and consequently a still higher Advancement in our Scale of characteristic Excellencies These Candidates for Fame will accordingly rise two Inches above those who are mentioned last and none are to pass under this Denomination for the future but whose Height is five Feet ten For these Qualities when thus united will frequently exert themselves in Strokes of Gallantry and Mirth which are so much the more honourable as they are dangerous to the Person or the Purse of the ingenious Artist who has the Courage or Curiosity to attempt the Experiment The demolishing of Windows knocking down of Watchmen bilking of Waiters at Places of Entertainment with other Instances of the like Kind are very laudable and convincing Proofs of these compound Qualities residing together in the same Habitation The last Quality which greatly overtops the rest and is indeed the Crown and Perfection of all is the wonderful and most ingenious Faculty of modern Criticism And as this is in the most exalted Manner the Gift of Nature whoever has the Happiness to be born a true Critic is at least six Feet complete A Critic is the Masterpiece and noblest Work of Nature and may justly be expected to bear about  him some distinguishing Tokens which will enable a Spectator at the first View to acknowledge and revere his Merits Hence she has bestowed on him a more than ordinary Portion of the  Daring  and  Tremendous  and these would appear to very little Effect in a Person of less Dimensions than those which we have here assigned him The Wit may be pert and sanguine the Man of Humour confident or overbearing but it is the Critic alone who glares horribly terrific His every Look freezes the young Author's Blood and at the Sound of his Voice the rooted Seats have been known to be torn from the Ground and hurled violently through the Air in furious and wild Commotion Phaenomena like these can only be produced by that iron Strength of Lungs and brazen Audacity of Figure which Nature has so liberally imparted to the modern Critic  It will be necessary to obviate an Objection arising from popular Prejudice that the Science of Criticism being to examine into the Merit of all Productions of Genius and Learning it does not seem to demand the Size and Dimensions which I have made essential to the Character but the Objectors I apprehend are mistaken in the End of modern Criticism and have not perhaps duly reflected on the necessary Qualities to discharge the Province they are desirous of allotting it To execute that Task would require a moderate Portion of Sense Taste and Judgment under the Direction of Modesty and Candour Talents so little practised by those who have taken up the Occupation of a a Critic that they appear on all Occasions not to have the least Conception of them Whoever will give himself Leave to consider that the Character of a Critic a Wit and Man of Humour in the present Estimation of the World is supported wholly by Mechanical Operations in which the Understanding has no Manner of Share he will easily agree with me that the surest  Method to discover those Characters must be taken from that Part which is principally concerned and as we can truly judge from outward Appearances alone I have shewn to a Demonstration that the Stature of a Person is the only infallible Criterion by which we can decide on the Justness of his Pretensions and that no one for the future can have any Right to either of those Characters but whose Dimensions will exactly tally with the Measures of this Standard

Paper and that he would leave Orders with the Publisher to send it to his House in the Country every  Saturday  for the future  The Direction of a young Gentleman's Genius to any particular Profession is a Point of more Consequence than perhaps appears to the Inattentive as to this Step is often to be imputed the Happiness or  Misery of the Person in the ensuing Part of his Days This Circumstance in Life is not unlike what we see at a BowlingGreen where before a Man plays off he should consider the Byass of his Bowl and if it is delivered with Judgment it makes its Way to the destined Point but if there should be too much Rapidity in the Outset or if a proper Degree of Force should be wanting to forward it it either runs beyond the Mark or lags in the Middle of its Progress On this Account it is no easy Matter to advise upon so delicate a Point as I have now to handle  I have considered all the Professions and I really think them very precarious Many great Estates and eminent Titles have been derived from the Law but it is now reduced to such a State that without very great Friends a Person possessed of the Talents of a  Murray  shall never rise to any Degree of Eminence With Regard to Physick a Genius may spend his Time in saving the Lives of Patients in Garrets and doing real Services to Mankind without any Emolument to himself while  Doctor Slaughter  puts his Licence to kill in Execution upon Thousands of his Majesty's welldisposed Subjects and lolls at Ease in his Chariot  In the Army it is to be feared that Preferment goes more by Interest than Merit And there is not a Wind that can blow from any Quarter of the Heavens but fills the Merchant's Imagination with pictured Scenes of Shipwrecks and while he breaks the Seal of a Letter he trembles for fear of receiving the News of some Correspondent's Failure The Stage indeed seems to be a Place where Merit meets its Reward but even there there are great Disadvantages and though a Genius should start up with the Talents of a  Garrick  and Person of a  Barry  it is odds but his Eye is one Time or other knock'd out by a well directed Apple  There is however a Way of Life which I cannot help thinking the most eligible and not to keep the  Reader any longer in Suspense the Occupation I mean is that of a Gamester After mature Deliberation the Gentlemen of this Calling seem to me to be in Possession of greater Advantages than any of the others and the Inconveniences attending them are not upon a Ballance with the Conveniences  A Gamester from a constant Habit of venturing large Sums upon the Turning up of a Card or a Die acquires that thorough Disregard for Money which is so much recommended by the Philosophers Like  Catiline  in  Sallust  he is  alieni appetens sui profusis  at the same Time that he is desirous of his Friends Substance he has the Pleasure of being profuse in his own private Gratifications Instead of creeping through Life with that Mediocrity of Spirit which depresses the Man of Business the Gamester lives with an Eclat  Ryan Venable  or  Tomkyns  supply him with his Wines and he is every Hour gaining an Insight into Men and Manners As rude Health has too much of the Country in it and of course is not very pleasing to the Ladies he acquires by his midnight Vigil a pallid meagre Countenance which generally denotes an intimate Knowledge of the Town and while others deceive one another in the Face of Day a Gamester has the Modesty to fly to the Covert of the Night and if I may use the Poet's Words  The pale Moon and Stars alone are conscious of the Theft  While the Man of Genius is left undisturbed in his Study the gaydressed Footman knocks at the Gamester's Doos and leaves the agreeable Card to invite him to my Lady  Bragwell  's There he has an Opportunity of carrying on a Design upon a Lady's Money and Virtue at the same Time and if he can once contrive to get her in his Books he sinds it no difficult Matter to make her give  personal  Security and when once a Woman's Body is mortgaged there is no Equity of Redemption  There are many other Conveniences annexed to a Life of Play and therefore I would have my Friend Mr  Oldcastle  train up his Son to this Profession and to encourage all Beginners in this Way I shall dismiss this Paper with only one Article of True Intelligence which I take to be of the utmost Consequence to all such Adventurers  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  To the  PUBLIC  LATELY arrived in this Town from  Paris  the  Marquis de Fourberie  well known to many of the Nobility and Gentry who have been in Foreign Parts He is well versed in all the different Branches of Gaming and he teaches how to play the whole Game in a Month's Time  He has taken an Apartment for this Purpose in the  Haymarket  where he reads Lectures every Day in the Week except  Wednesday  when he attends the Gentlemen of the City at his Room near the  Royal Exchange  where he will let any young Prentice or City Smart into the Secret without Hindrance of Business  He has taught since his coming here several Gamesters of both Sexes and it was he instructed the  Scaramouch  who carried off fifteen hundred Pounds from the last Masquerade  Gentlemen and Ladies may learn in a private Manner without being overseen by Strangers while Learning and for the more expeditiously compleating them there is a Set to practise from Seven in the Evening till Three in the Morning  As several Persons have and do think still that it is impossible to learn without going into Company he thinks proper to inform them of his Method for that Purpose He first teaches the Scholar the Shuffle then the different Methods of Cutting next he explains his  Rules by the Assistance of secondhand Cards when the Party is so qualified he makes his own Family sit down with them where they play most of the Games in Vogue after the Person has learned in this Manner which he or she may do in a very short Time he dares answer for them they will be qualified to play in any genteel Company whatever  Jacta est alea  N B  the  Marquis  had not a Stitch of Cloaths when he began and he now shines away with his  Dresden  Ruffles and Diamond Ring Such Persons as are desirous to learn any Branch excessive quick may come twice or thrice a Day or lodge and board in the House for the Time He insures for a small Praemium one thousand Pounds a Year to any ingenious young Gentleman who will make himself Master of his Rules He sells Dice for Gentlemen to carry in their Pockets  NUMB  GRAY'SINN  Saturday  May    Ausus non operam non formidare Poetae  Nomen adoratum quondam nunc paene procaci  Monstratum digito  PRAEDIUM RUSTICUM  _DERISION and Contempt have been for many Ages the Portion of most Authors whom Rank in Life or Superiority of Abilities have not eminently raised above the common Herd of their Fraternity and the Name of Poet in every Company where the Word is mentioned  is sure to excite ludicrous Ideas of Garrets unwashed Shirts and unpaid Taylors By these Means it has obtained that younger Brothers had rather take a Pistol or a Pack of Cards in their Hands to raise a Livelihood than endeavour to help out the Year's Income by the Exertion of their Talents dreading the Infamy of Wit more than any other Imputation that can be fixed upon their Characters  This Effect is not produced without a Concurrence of many efficient Causes among which the principal one is the known Poverty of the Generality of the Tribe that write and among all the Inconveniences of Indigence it has been well said that there is not a greater Hardship than that Ridicule which it brings upon those who labour under its Lash  Nil habit infaelix Paupertas durius in se  Quam quod ridiculos homines facit  The Belly has been often called the Teacher of Art and the Inspirer of Wit but I apprehend this Maxim can only be understood of a full Belly  Satur est cum dicit Horatius Evoe  Horace  was warmed with good Cheer when he calls out to  Bacchus  to spare him says  Juvenal  and the same Author adds with an elegant Vein of Pleasantry that fine Writing is the Production of an exalted Mind free from the Sollicitude of procuring a Blanket and that if  Virgil  wanted a Lodging and a Boy to attend him the Snakes would fall from the Fury which he so admirably describes and the Trumpet would not sound to War with so shrill a Clangor  Nam si Virgilio puer tolerabile deesset  Hospitium caderent omnes à crinibus Hydri  Surda nibil gemeret grave Buccina  It is not therefore to be wondered that Poverty should diminish the Poet's Lustre since it not only renders him an Object of Contempt but extinguishes the Fire of his Genius and such is the Fate or Perverseness of Authors that to Circumstances which they cannot remove they are industrious to add many of their own creating so true is the Saying of Mr  Congreve  that wherever Wit is it is always contriving its own Ruin The Race of Writers are extremely irascible prone to Malice and Envy towards the Man whom they perceive in Possession of Fame and instead of endeavouring to equal him with an honest Emulation their Aim is to snatch the Laurel from his Brow or if they cannot reach it to wither it on his Head by the bitter Blasts of Calumny and Detraction  Voltaire  delivers himself on this Topic with so much Delicacy and good Sense that I shall here translate the Passage  It is a Disgrace  says he  to the human Mind that the Republic of Letters should be infested with personal Resentments private Cabals and mean Intrigues which should only subsist among the Slaves of Fortune What Advantage can accrue to Authors from this Civil War Their Animosities have no other Tendency than to depreciate a Profession which it is in their Power to render respectable Why should the Art of thinking finely the greatest Blessing Man can share from Heaven become an Object of Ridicule It is really hard that Men of Genius should render themselves by their mutual Invectives the Sport of Pools and instead of being revered as the Masters and Instructors of the Public turn out the Buffoons and Zanies of the Town  There is another Reason which contributes strongly to bring a Disreputation upon Poets and that is their mean and prostitute Servility to a Set of Men whom they call their Patrons These Gentlemen are for the most Part eager after Praise and careless of the Means  by which they might obtain an honest Fame hence the  Parnassian  Incense is extremely grateful and is therefore profusely offered up by every scribbling Fool who vainly thinks to wriggle himself into Preferment But the Misfortune is that what happens in this Case is not answerable to the Writer's Intention his Patron plumes himself upon the imputed Accomplishments and glows with Rapture and Self Admiration while for the Bard he feels no Passion but Contempt and the rest of the World with Pleasure behold Infamy and Disappointment the Rewards of Venality and Prostitution  As I have always entertained great good Wishes for the Gentlemen of the Quill I have devised a Method by the Observance of which they will be able to retrieve in some Measure the Honour of their Calling and obviate that Torrent of Contumely which at present bears hard upon them  In the first Place I would have them frequently inculcate that Fortune is only the Deity of Fools and if she has not been favourable to them they had better enjoy a virtuous Independence in private than by an ambitious Poverty bring themselves under the Contempt and Ridicule of the Affluent  Secondly  Instead of wasting Paper in mutual Calumny and Detraction I would recommend to them to vent their Anger upon the Critics or the  Malevoli  a Species of People highly prejudicial to the Cause of Literature on whom no Severities can be too hard as it is notorious that not one of the Race about Town at present is any way fit for the Province he has usurped a total Ignorance of the learned Languages and a lamentable want of Taste together with a plentiful Share of Spleen and Illnature being the distinguishing Characteristics of the whole Tribe  Thirdly  and  lastly  I would advise my Brother Writers to dispense their Panegyric with a little more Reserve and always with an Eye to Truth from whence  it will follow that they will find themselves more courted by their Patrons and their Butlers will the more readily condescend to hear them from the SideBoard  To maintain a Poet's Dignity and Ease  is a beautiful Sentiment of Mr  Pope  and his Life and Manners shew that he carried it from Theory into Fractice Who is not delighted to hear him declare with a noble Pride  Enough for half the greatest of these Days  To 'scape my Censure not expect my Praise  Whenever I reflect upon the Conduct of that great Genius I find it hard to determine within myself which holds most of Admiration the Fineness of his Perceptions and the Elegance of his Poetry or that Grace of Character and that unprostituted dignified Independence which will always do Honour to the Man Doctor  Swift  likewise with less Delicacy of Manners jealously preserved his own Respect and sure I am that the Writings of these two great Authors though they have both exquisite Finishings in their Kind have always received an additional Lustre from the selfcreated Importance of their Characters  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Vauxhall  May    THE Diversions of this Place began on  Tuesday  Evening last and it was computed that there were near five thousand People in the Gardens It is

Pleasure which thrills through the tender Nerve of Imagination but what receives additional Delight from numberless adventitious Circumstances To the  Association of Ideas  explained by Mr  Locke  may also be added the  Association of Passions  which reciprocally  awaken each other and agitate the Mind with their mixed Operation Thus the primary Effect which any Object or Landskip may have on a Person's Taste is heightened and enlarged beyond its Bounds a Recollection of collateral Images starts upon the Fancy the Passions pour in their auxiliar Influence and our Joy is encreased by several Sensations at once like a River which admits at different Inlets the tributary Illapse of several lesser Streams and thence swelled above its Banks dispenses Verdure and Fertility to all the Country round That this is the Case in many Situations of the Mind will be obvious to any Body that will but turn his Eyes inwards and I believe it is not more so in any one Instance than the Joy we seel from the Opening of the Spring  In my Opinion we are not acquainted with a more complicated Pleasure our Love of Novelty which is a leading Principle in the Heart of Man implanted in us for the most benevolent Purposes by the Author of our Frame is particularly gratified at this Season of the Year the Appearance which Things assume is not only pleasing to us on Account of its natural Beauty but also from its Newness to the Eye During the Winter all Nature seems to suffer a melancholy Distress the animal Creation droops their Spirits seem sunk into dumb Despair and we read their languid Situation in the mute imploring Eye the vegetable World seems also tending to Decay and a general Scene of Calamity overspreads the Face of Nature From this State to see gradually a new Creation emerging and every Thing reviving with renovated Vigour cannot fail of pleasing our Imagination the whole Race of animal Life feels the genial Influence of the soft Season from a Turbulence of Clouds and all the Inclemencies of the Elements the Scene is shifted to enlivening Suns blue Skies Hills cloathed with Verdure imbowering  Shades refreshing Streams and the Harmony of the Grove  The learned Reader will perceive with what Elegance  Virgil  has described this vernal Delight in the Words of my Motto The Passage from whence I have selected these Lines is carried on with an Air of Enthusiasm he seems particularly fond of this Season and the whole is closed with a moral Reflection on the Providence of the supreme Being who placed this Part of the Year as a Medium to render the Transition from intense Cold to the Heat of the Summer less perceptible to our Constitutions There are many short Sketches of this Nature in the same Author we frequently find him casting a side Glance this Way and I will venture to say every Reader of Taste must have been greatly delighted with these Byeviews as on a Road the transient Opening of an agreeable Prospect is always acceptable to the Traveller  Horace  is also happy when giving a Description of the Spring and  Milton  the great Father of the Sublime in  English  Poesy has in many Places touched it with great Delicacy Perhaps some of the most beautiful Imagery in his Poem is to be found in the softer Paintings of this Nature which he has so often taken Occasion to introduce  Besides the obvious Pleasures of this Season already mentioned there is another Circumstance which still renders it more delightful the Spring more particularly than any other Time of the Year is the Season of Love At this Juncture we feel the Sun warm at our Hearts young Health smiles in the Virgin's Eye the Morn or Evening Walks affords Sensations unfelt before a pleasing Stillness runs o'er the Faculties of the Mind and every Thing conspires to fill the Heart with what the Poet calls  the Spirit of Love and amorous Delight  By Love I would not be supposed to mean a mere gross Impulse of Passion but that Elegance of Desire that Refinement of Taste which distinguishes the Gentleman  and never fails of being acceptable to the amiable Sex  Whatever may be rattled over a Bottle at a Tavern we are obliged to the Ladies for the most valuable Gratifications of our Lives and after all our highboasted Reason and our superior Abilities to them it is owing that our Manners become more gentle and our Sentiments acquire a finer Polish Our Looks and Gestures assume from them a molder Air our Passions soften into Harmony and Joy and the Man who has used himself to this agreeable Converse is acquainted with a thousand Delicacies in his Amusements and several Elegancies in his Way of thinking to which vulgar Souls are absolutely Strangers  Instead of expatiating further on this Subject I shall here insert a Copy of Verses which were communicated to me by an ingenious Gentleman whom I am proud to call my Friend The candid Reader I persuade myself will be pleased with the Perusal and the small Critics who buzz about the  Gray'sInn Journal  may amuse themselves with considering whether the Lines should be called Ode Song Pastoral or Elegy and whether they sufficiently express the Tenderness of Love and the Process of the Passion

unspeakable Pleasure I have observed for a considerable Time past that those unhappy Divisions which have been the Bane of Society ever since the late Commotions in the North are in a great Measure reconciled at least so far as to make an Intercourse between People of different political Sentiments not altogether impracticable The Distinction of  Whig  or  Jacobite  seems to be at present thought not essentially necessary towards constituting a good Companion and the Word HONEST appears to have acquired a more enlarged  Signification insomuch that whenever we honour a Man with that Appellation it is generally understood that we mean something more than a Person who is ready to drink a certain Set of Toasts In short the Enthusiasm of Party in this Respect is so far abated that one may spend a chearful Evening with some of the most sanguine Friends to the Government without dedicating a single Glass to the Memory of King  William  and I have more than once within these last six Months sat with some reputed Wellwishers to the exiled Family without being under a Necessity of ungartering my Stockings and pulling off my Wig at every Return of the Bottle But alas what avails this Coalition The Spirit of Party is so intimately interwoven in the Constitution of an  Englishman  that all Attempts to extinguish it must inevitably fail of Success It may indeed be diverted but will not admit of being eradicated  The Truth of this Observation is sufficiently manifested by the two powerful Factions which now disunite this great Metropolis  I could wish for the Pen of  Bolingbroke  in order to trace the Rise and Progress of those fatal Dissensions which sow Discord in Families make Breaches among Friends embitter Society and if not timely restrained threaten Danger to the State  The Reader I believe has anticipated me and plainly sees that I can mean no other than the Sects distinguished by the Denomination of  Garrickeans  and  Barryists  The several Pretensions of the Theatrical Leaders from whom the Names of Distinction just mentioned are derived are so extremely difficult to be adjusted that two Persons can hardly be found within the Cities of  London  and  Westminster  who persectly agree in their Way of thinking upon this Head And as the amiable Sex generally support with great Impetuosity their  favourite Principles it is inconceivable to those who have not had Opportunity of observing it what Feuds and Animosities prevail among the female Partizans of these Heroes  I was lately present at a Controversy between two Ladies who had adopted opposite Sentiments the one being a  Garrickean  and the other a  Barryist  The Dispute began in Formthe  Garrickean  insisting upon it that she did not like  Barry  and the  Barryist  protesting with equal Emphasis that she could not so highly admire  Garrick  Thus mutual Contradiction being given the Debate soon grew warm and the  Garrickean  Lady enforced her Opinion with great Vehemence  There is something so clever something so lively something so I don't know how in  Garrick  And his Eyes sparkle so that to be sure he is the sweetest Creature in the World  Her Antagonist withstood this Torrent of Eloquence and with no less Energy replied  Nay Madam if you talk of Eyes nobody can say but  Barry  has as lovely Eyes as ever were seenThen he is so tall and so fine a Man that Lord bless me there is no ComparisonI am sure  Garrick  can't make Love so wellcome now you must give that upNot I upon my Honour Ma'em resumes the  Garrickean  why should I give it up All the Gentlemen and you must allow they know best say  Garrick  is the finest  Romeo  The Weight of this Reasoning piqued the  Barryist  and she exclaimed with no small Appearance of Indignation  Pshaw what signifies what the Men say I don't mind it a Farthingthey envy the dear Man because he is so handsome  The Earnestness and Resentment with which this was delivered excited a general Laugh and the Ladies had Prudence enough to suspend the Contest for that Evening but I have been since informed that they renewed it the next Day with redoubled Vigour and proceeded so far as to use some  certain Figures of Speech which are thought not quite consistent with female Delicacy  A wide Breach ensued between the Disputants in Consequence of this Disagreement which was in a few Days happily healed by the Mediation of some Friends and the Ladies now visit as usual but have obliged themselves in the most solemn Manner for their mutual Quiet never to mention for the future the Names of  Garrick  and  Barry  in the Company of each other  I have only related this Affair as a slight Instance of the unhappy Effects attending our PartyDivisions That they are productive of the greatest Uneasiness in the Conjugal State is so very notorious that People of different Ways of thinking seldom chuse to engage with each other being aware that Feuds and Discontents must be unavoidable when Man and Wife  do not go the same Way  An intimate Acquaintance of mine who is strongly in the  Garrickean  Interest paid his Addresses to a very agreeable and everywayaccomplish'd young Lady but a violent  Barryist  The young Couple liked one another perfectly well and there appeared no reasonable Objection to the Match but the Difference of Principles  This however was an Obstacle not easily to be got over The Relations on both Sides had several Meetings and many Difficulties arose in settling this Point which was at last adjusted by a Compromise The Lawyer who was employed to draw the Articles received Directions to insert a Clause importing that all the Boys born of that Marriage should be bred up  Garrickeans  and the Girls  Barryists  The Reader I believe is surprized that I have not in this Dissertation upon Parties taken any Notice of the  Quinists  a Faction which in its Time has been by no Means contemptible whether we consider the Bulk or Quality of the Leaders The Reason isI have observed that this Party is considerably declined  since the Abdication of their Monarch most of them having subscribed to the Revolution which took Place in  Goodman  's  Fields  in the Year Fortytwo and those few who still continue attached to this Cause being old Men from whom no Disturbance can be expected in the female World  That these Heartburnings threaten Danger to the State I think is very obvious The Business of the Theatres is almost finished and it is expected that both Houses will be prorogued in a few Days when many of the Members will go into the Country and most unquestionably excite a PartySpirit whereever they fix We shall hear from one Town that the Inhabitants are divided into  Marrists  and  Scrasists  from another that the  Usherists  have got the upper Hand and the Favourers of  Raftor  do not dare to shew their Faces What Influence these Divisions may have upon the approaching Election I leave to the Gentlemen in Power to consider not doubting but they will thank me for this friendly Intimation and make a proper Use of it  From this fair and candid Representation of the present State of Parties among us many useful Reflections may be drawn which as they are extremely obvious the Reader's good Sense will undoubtedly suggest to him I might here dismiss my Subject in the Words of  Horace  Verbum non amplius addam  But I am unwilling to conclude without declaring my own Principles I have the Satisfaction to say that I am conscious of being entirely free of PartyPrejudice I am neither a  Garrickean  nor a  Barryist  but between both in an honest MeanI defy my greatest Enemies to prove that I ever gave a Clap or Hiss but according to the Dictates of my Conscience And O my dear Countrymen and Countrywomen  there is nothing I so ardently desire as an Union of all true Friends to our Theatrical Entertainments in order to rouze the Directors of the  DruryLane  and  CoventGarden  Companies from their Lethargy and make them sensible that though the Public have a violent Appetite for Plays and can feed on a  Romeo  and  Juliet  thirty or forty Times in a Season yet they would be glad of a little VarietyThis surely they may modestly expect as the heavy Subsidies for the Maintenance of these States are raised entirely upon them If we should be happy enough to obtain this next Winter I flatter myself all Discord will subside We shall admire the Powers of a  Garrick  and do Justice to his inimitable Performances in a  Lear  a  Richard  a  Macbeth  an  Hamlet  a  Ranger  or a  Bendick  without being any Way disinclined to yield to the tender Emotions of a  Castalio  or backward to acknowledge the Dignity and homefelt Anguish of an  Othello  In short we shall then enter the Theatre without any other Biass on our Minds than a Disposition to be pleased  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Bedford Coffeehouse  May    YESTERDAY Evening between the Hours of Seven and Eight Mr  Town  came to the  Board of Criticism  in his

  Contemptu Famae contemni Virtutes  TACITUS  _THE Sentiment which is very beautifully expressed in the Words of my Motto grew naturally out of the Conversation at the last Meeting of our Club and to enforce it still further Mr  Gulliver  who then occupied the Chair produced a Stricture of oriental History which he believed would impress the Reflection deeper on the Mind as it carried with it the Admonitions of Experience and therefore as such I shall recommend it to the Perusal of my Readers  In the Chronicles of the Sultans of the East it is recorded that when  Othman  held the Rank of Visier under a Prince of the  Sassanian  Race and by his faithful Councils added Security Lustre and Dignity to the Throne his Son  Mustapha  display'd in his early Bloom all the Virtues which could endear him to the best of Fathers and render him amiable in the Eyes of all Beholders  Achmet  the Hermit who had been called forth from his Retreat in order to attend the Cultivation of his tender Mind had taken care to season him with Religion and to inflame his young Imagination with the Desire of a fair and honest Fame The Sage well knew that this Propensity would be a strong secondary  Aid to the native Beauty of Virtue would warm and cherish his native Goodness and invigorate the Exertion of it Accordingly  Mustapha  soon drew the Eyes of all Men upon him his Conduct was a constant Emanation of Benevolence and in his Bosom glowed that intense heroic Ardour which soon after distinguished him in the Field of glorious Danger In a short Time he arrived to the highest Degree of Popularity the Sultan heaped Favours on him in what might be called a Profusion of Liberality had not his Merit daily deserved it from him He was delegated with unlimited Authority to command the Armies of the Sultan and from the Confines of  Persia  to the  Indian  Ocean he soon reduced every Thing under Subjection Though he was yet green in Years each Tongue was mute in his Presence and before him every Eye looked down with a Kind of reverential Awe he loved the Prince who raised him to this State of Elevation and by the Gentleness of his Manners he softened that Envy which might otherwise arise against the Lustre of his Glory  While  Mustapha  was constantly reaping fresh Laurels and gratifying his insatiable Love of Fame by daily Acquisitions of Glory his Father at home met with a Reverse of Fortune  Othman  possessed all those Qualities which shone forth in his Son with a more striking Lustre and he vainly imagined that in a corrupt degenerate Court he could be great and good with Impunity But the Storm now gathered heavily in Clouds around him and the turbulent Tempests of Jealousy Ambition Hatred and Revenge environed him with a Whirlwind more dreadful than that which tears up whole Continents of Sand in the Desarts of  Arabia  The grand Apartments in his House which were formerly filled with a Band of Courtiers were now empty and forlorn he was divested of all his Honours his Trust was taken away from him and after a Series  of Years spent in the Service of his Prince he was stripped of every Thing but his paternal Estate whither he withdrew to shelter himself from an ungrateful World  In this Retirement  Othman  what were your Thoughts what were your Sensations The Sun ushered in a Day void of Occupation and the Night a Train of restless Dreams At length his Constitution received such severe Strokes from a constant Succession of corrosive Cares that he languished under the Pressure and his Soul sickened to Desperation A gloomy visionary Light obscured his Eyes with dim Suffusion and he beheld with Joy the approaching Sunset of his Days As he lay languishing on the Bed of Sickness he gave Orders that his Son might be informed of his Situation  Mustapha  immediately quitted his high Command flew to his dying Father's languid Arms and in a Gush of Tears embraced his agonizing Body  Othman  with what little Strength he had left raised his Head and fixing his faded Eyeballs on him "My Son said he" hear my Words  You have beheld your Father in the Sunshine of Prosperity you now behold him in the last Extreme of Misery I am fallen a Prey to the Intrigues of illdesigning Menthe Angel of Death now hovers over his Victim then listen to my last DirectionsAvoid public Honoursfly from Courts as from the Monsters of the Desart

an ungrateful WorldSteal through Life imperceptible like  the Path of the Arrow which leaves no Trace behind itlet your Moderation shade you from Envy and look down upon the Giddy    He could no more his Lot for Eternity was cast and he expired  Mustapha  wept in Bitterness of Anguish over the best of Fathers he treasured up his Precepts in the inmost Recesses of his Soul and instantly began to conform his Conduct to the Practice of them His Dignities and Honours he resigned forthwith and in the Sullenness of his Soul he locked himself from the World His House no longer resounded with Singers and with Minstrels no longer did Amber and Aloes administer their rich Perfumes the Vases of Agate which in his Father's Time overflowed with all the delicious Liquors of the East lay tumbled into an unregarded Heap and even the Hand of Charity which was before stretched out at his Gate was now congealed and frozen up Echo no longer repeated his Praises and Scandal began to accumulate Disgrace upon him This he heard and he despised the Rumour the many Lessons given him by his Tutor were now totally forgot the Seeds of Virtue lay dormant in his Breast and his Love of Fame was now

 Mustapha  thus dozed away his Hours ingloriously inactive the Tidings of his Situation were wafted abroad by every Breeze and at length reached the Ears of  Achmet  in his Hermitage The venerable old Man heard the Story with the severest Compunction his Heart was appalled within him as if the Hand of Death had smote him he sat down in his Haram but there no Angel whispered to his Meditation no Inspiration bore his Thoughts aloft to the prime Source of Being  Mustapha  's Shame depressed the Swellings of Enthusiasm and quite extinguished the pious Fervor of his Soul He was tormented with the Reflection that so noble a Youth should stop short in the Middle of his Career and check such excellent Propensities as he knew were lodged in his Breast At length he arose and taking his Staff in his Hand he extinguished the Light  which burned before him and set out on a Journey over the Desarts of  Arabia  and in a short Time arrived at his Pupil's Habitation  It was with Difficulty he gained Admission but the Gates were no sooner opened for him than he went streight to his young Pupil's Apartment  Mustapha  was reclined upon a Sofa his Looks sullenly fixed on the Ground and his Mind hardening into Insensibility  Achmet  eagerly presented himself before him His Eyes were vivid and piercing though the Quickness of their Lustre was somewhat diminished by the galling Effusion of Tears which this unexpected Shock had cost him The Winter of Age had shed its Snows upon his Head and Beard and the lively Expression of Passions which throbbed in mingled Tumult about his Heart rendered him an alarming Object to his Pupil A conscious Blush diffused itself over his Face at Sight of the hoary Sage and both their Sensations being too big for Utterance their Tongues were suspended and their Eyes overflowing discoursed for a while in the most eloquent pathetic Silence At length  Achmet  faintly uttered  "Mustapha"  and a Gush of Tears choaked up the rest  Mustapha  at this was covered with Confusion and attempted to break from him but the palsied Nerves of the venerable Hermit felt a Renovation of Strength from the glowing Purpose of his Soul and laying fast hold of his Pupil he exclaimed  You shall not put me from you in me your Genius now alarms you by me it means to rouze you from your Lethargy and awaken the dying Embers of that amiable Fire which formerly kindled all your Spirits in those happier Days when my Instructions were refreshing to your Ears as the Morning Dews to the Verdure which cloaths the Fields of  Damascus  But now how art thou fallen each finer Principle of Virtue is suppressed and you are even deaf to the Voice of Fame that sweetest Music to a virtuous Ear But to redeem  thee at once from the Dreams of Folly and overweening Pride in which thy Soul is now sluggishly immersed read there that mystic Truth which a  Genie  put into my Hand in an Hour of Inspiration when my Thoughts were swelled with sublime Ideas of the Dispensations of him who is in the Heaven of Heavens and whose wonderworking Hand launched forth the Planets into the illimitable Void and still continueth to produce the Harmony of the physical and moral World by various Secrets and indirect Causes  The Heart of  Mustapha  was alarmed and he read as follows  When VIRTUE was sent down from the third Heaven to restrain the irregular Passions of Mankind the Dignity of her Mien and Beauty of her Aspect were sufficiently attractive to make her admired of all Beholders But such is the Depravity of human Nature that these Allurements soon began to lose of their Influence and VIRTUE shortly finding herself neglected and forlorn returned to her celestial Mansion in order to prefer her Complaint against the Sons of Men There she remonstrated that blind Mankind was not only insensible to her personal Charms but also deaf to the Promise of Rewards which were to be dispensed to her Votaries in a future State of Existence Though this was a sufficient Provocation of Wrath yet such was the supreme Benevolence that VIRTUE was again sent down upon her Mission and the better to strengthen her Interests FAME was ordered to attend her with an high Commission to dispense temporary Retributions even on this Side of the Grave As soon as they reached the Verge of human Nature FAME blew aloft her silver Trumpet and an instantaneous Glow was kindled in all Hearts Wherever VIRTUE was cherished FAME pursued her Footsteps and if Court was any where made to her alone she was sure to withold her Favours  until the Candidates found Means by the Recommendation of VIRTUE to insinuate themselves into her good Graces By this amiable Union Mankind were restrained within just Restrictions and were excited to a Series of meritorious Actions either by an Attachment to the Allurements of VIRTUE or from a Desire of obtaining the Applause of FAME But short is the Duration of all sublunary Things FAME in her Turn began to share the same Fate that VIRTUE had met before her the Appetites of Men were now wellnigh sated and the Musick of Applause no longer sounded grateful to the Ear It was observable that wherever she met with a Repulse VIRTUE was soon known to follow her and it very rarely happened that she remained with above one or two in an Age without her Attendant FAME In Process of Time Matters were carried to that Extremity that this celestial Pair were tired of their Pilgrimage and wearied out at length they resolved to offer up a joint Petition to be recalled They therefore flew to the Throne of him who is in the Heaven of Heavens and humbly urged that it was in vain for them to sojourn any longer upon Earth as deluded Mankind was now entirely seduced by the spurious Ornaments of the Monster VICE which had issued out of the Regions of Darkness and set up in Opposition to all that VIRTUE and FAIR FAME could inspire In this Instance again the tender Care of Heaven was eminently displayed and these two radiant Beings were a second Time commanded to return to Earth with Directions that however depraved the Appetites of Men might be they should persist in an unremitted Course of Endeavours for their Service But the more effectually to strengthen their Cause a Fiend called INFAMY was ordered to issue forth from the unhallowed Cell of VICE and to adhere close to her whatsoever Way she should bend her Course  It was likewise ordained that whoever should betray a Disregard for VIRTUE and HONEST FAME should be branded by INFAMY and that these two should thus continue to wander among Mankind until the Angel of Death should walk forth by the Command of the ALMIGHTY and sweep the whole Race from the Face of the Earth to receive that Retribution of Rewards and Punishments which may be due to their VIRTUE or VICE  Mustapha  now perceived the Mists of Error clearing away from before his Understanding he embraced  Achmet  and poured out the Effusions of his Gratitude for thus recalling him to the Task of Virtue whose Strength consists in Activity He acknowledged that the Transition is easy from a Contempt of Fame to an equal Disregard for the Virtues that deserve it and the Name of  Mustapha  during the Remainder of the Chronicles of this Reign makes a distinguished Figure and it is said that he closed a Life of VIRTUE with Honour and Renown  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Child's Coffeehouse St Paul's

Visiting and being willing to discharge the Demands upon me as expeditiously as possible I determined to dedicate an entire Evening to the Settlement of this Account I accordingly writ my Name upon about fifteen Pieces of Card and fallied out upon this important Business At most of the Places where I  called I had no Occasion to alight but discharged my Obligation by delivering to the Footman at the Door one of the Tokens of modern Friendship above mention'd I had however the good Fortune of finding some of my  Friends  at home who received me with prodigious Affability and after desiring mine and giving me their Opinion of the important Disputes concerning  Elizabeth Canning  and  Mary Squires  dismissed me with great Politeness  I was not a little fatigued with the successive Repetition of the same flimzy Chitchat in every Company where I was admitted and quite disgusted with so trifling a Manner of spending my Time I was just going to direct the Coachman to drive home when I recollected that I had not seen my Friend Mr  Discount  of  Cateatonstreet  since the Lord Mayor's Day  This determined me to steer my Course towards the City and my good Genius prevailed so far that I found Mr  Discount  his Lady and two Daughters at home it being the Day upon which Mrs  Discount  saw Company  As soon as I entered the Room my old Acquaintance saluted me in a friendly Manner and assured me that he was glad to see me his Lady in an ironical Compliment delivered with a forced Smile gave me to understand that she was highly sensible of the Honour I did her Family in condescending to come into the City and the young Ladiès curtesied and told me with some Appearance of Resentment that they were extremely glad to find that Mr  Ranger  had not entirely forgot his old Friends  This Reception somewhat disconcerted me however I endeavoured to acquit myself with the usual Compliments such as  That I had the greatest Esteem for Mr  Discount  's FamilyThat Nobody respected them moreBut that Affairs of Business had engrossed my TimeThat I seldom could command an Hour to myself  But that I certainly should not be so had a Visiter for the futurs  As soon as this preliminary Point was settled Mr  Discount  seated me next himself and turning about asked me  How Things went at our End of the Town    What says he shall we have a Lottery do you think  I was going to answer that I really was not in the Secret of those Schemes when the eldest Miss  Discount  interposed and said  Lord Papa do you imagine that Mr  Ranger  troubles himself about the Things you talk of in your City Coffeehouses What are your MoneyAffairs to himHave you been at a great many Plays last Winter Mr  Ranger  What do you think of  Foote  's Farce I saw it the first NightI would not miss

think of nothing but Diversions From Morning to Night my Ears Mr  Ranger  are dinned with  Garrick  and  Barry  and Dogs and Monkeys and  Mother Midnight  and  Spoonatissimo  and such a Jargon that one would imagine the Order of Things was inverted  Here the youngest Miss  Discount  seized the Conversation  Nay now Papa says she because you do not go to those Places yourself you would not have any Body else go    That's true  Betty  replied Mamma He is a strange Man to be sure Mr  Discount  has no Notion of any Thing genteel Well he must have his own Way    Mr  Discount  without taking Notice of these Interraptions resumed his Discourse  Why Sir says he this must portend somethingCertainly a Judgment hangs over the NationWe shall undoubtedly have another Earthquake at leastYou know the last Earthquake was occasioned by the  immense Number of Places of public Entertainment the Bishop said so in his Letterdo you not remember it Mr  Ranger  Here a loud Laugh made it unnecessary for

People do or they had better be out of the World and one must go to public Places or they will have nothing to talk ofIs it not so Mr  Ranger  Come now I am sure you are of my Opinion an't you  As I was unwilling to disoblige either Party in this Dispute I replied to the Lady in two Lines of  Prior  Seldom your Opinions err  Your Eyes are always in the right  This Topic had I thought been pursued rather too far therefore I waved the Conversation and asked the Ladies whether they had seen Mrs  Brillant  since her Marriage To this they all answered at once O yesWhereupon I took the Liberty to address myself particularly to Mrs  Discount  and desired to know  whether she did not think her a very fine Woman  A fine Woman Mr  Ranger  replied she how can you ask me such a Question To be sure she is a showy Woman and such a one as takes with the Men but you can't call her a fine Woman surely Then she wears her Cap so horridly and always overdresses herselfThe Gentlemen I know admire her but I protest I cannot see for what" Madam replied I I must beg Leave to be of a different Opinion in my Eyes Mrs  Brillant  appears a very amiable Woman and it gives me a great deal of Pleasure that she is so happily married" O indeed says Miss  Discount  I believe she is very happy for she has a very handsome Equipage and a sweet Pair of Earrings and then she sees a vast deal of CompanyThere were ninety Persons at her last RoutShe plays CrownWhist    I could not forbear observing that I was a little surprized so discerning a young Lady should estimate Mrs  Brillant  's Happiness from the Stake she played for at Whist when to me it appeared that she possessed a a more certain Source of Felicity in the amiable Qualities and polite Accomplishments of her Husband  O law that's true replied the Ladies they say her Husband too is a  pretty Man  We were proceeding farther on this Head when a thundering Rap was given at the Door and the Servant signified that Lady  Portsoken  was coming into the Room As I thought I had paid a Visit of a sufficient Length I took Advantage of the Alarm given by this City Knight's Lady and withdrew unnoticed  In my return Home I could not avoid reflecting on the capricious Notions the female World entertain of Happiness  To be dressed as well as others of the same Rank to be present at all public Places without considering the Entertainment

considere regnis  Urbem quam statuo vestra est  VIRG  _I HAVE of late received several very urgent Letters from my Correspondents in which they strenuously press me into the Service of my Country and though I have always disclaimed Politics as a Subject averse from my Inclinations these Gentlemen are for making a Statesman of me in my own Despite I must own I am not willing to be thrown off my Byass but when the Act of Parliament in favour of the  Jews  engrosses so much of our Conversation and has worked all our Spirits into a Ferment it then becomes the Duty of a Publick Writer to make his Bow to the Muses and devote one Lucubration to the Happiness and Welfare of his Countrymen  The  English  have naturally interwoven in their Constitution a peculiar Kind of national SelfLove and the least Attempt to dispense a Favour to Foreigners alarms their Fears and awakens that Jealousy which is natural to their very Frame It is to this we owe the general Discontent which has broke out among all Ranks of People upon the late Occasion but that it is owing to a mistaken Prejudice I believe will be manifest to any Man that does not see Things with the Jaundiced Fye of Party  It has been said that by this Act we give the Lie to the Scripture and fly in the Face of a peremptory Prophecy  which declares that the  Jews  should be without a fixed Scttlement in any Country a vagabond Race upon the Face of the Earth There was a Time when this Objection might be allowed to carry with it some Degree of Weight while Christianity subsisted in this Kingdom it would have been the grossest Absurdity to introduce a Bill of this Nature  But the Christian Dispensation has entirely disappeared from among us and I believe in the Memory of the oldest Person now living no Trace of it can be found which is in my Opinion a conclusive Argument in Favour of this Naturalization Act Were it any Way inconsistent with the Religion now in Fashion I persuade myself it would have met with Opposition from a certain Bench in the H of L but as nothing of this Kind was offered it is to be presumed that Judaism properly coincides with our present Disposition both in Church and State and I would therefore recommend this Doctrine to be preached from the Pulpit for the better quieting the Minds of Men and if the Right Reverends would issue out Pastoral Letters to this Purpose the Remedy would be quicker in its Operation and the mistaken Notions which the common People have imbibed would the sooner be effaced  About three Weeks since I had Occasion to take a Boat at  Whitehall  Stairs

naturalized I'll engage we shall have them all turn Watermen and they will have all the Business of the River to themselves  This Story which  is really a Matter of Fact will shew what Prejudices are entertained by the common People who have raised the violent Clamour against the  Israelites  on this Occasion and hence may be inferred that Wisdom doth not always cry out in the Streets For my Part I am persuaded when Things are considered dispassionately the Act will bear a different Aspect in the Eyes of all Men of Sense For who have been served by it Not the poor  Jews  who are still lest under the Severity denounced against them but the rich who are by this Stroke rescued from Heaven's Vengeance and this Regard to the Affluent and Contempt for the Moneyless I take to be perfectly consistent with the Genius of a trading Nation and I am of Opinion that from this Incident a very useful Moral may be enforced  viz  that Money cannot only influence sublunary Things but also supersede the Decrees of Providence and as I think this Act has given the Nation in general a very great Accession of Credit Reputation Honour and Riches I should be glad to see a further Step taken in order to render the Work complete I have not had Time to digest my Thoughts into a regular Scheme and shall therefore content myself to suggest a few Hints which may be improved at Maturity  First  As it is apparent from what has been observed already that the Christian Religion has no longer a Footing in this Country it may not be improper to repeal the sacramental Test and to substitute in its Room the Act of Circumcision for which Purpose proper Circumcisers may be found in  Duke'sPlace  who shall perform the Operation upon all our Placemen and a proper Number may be chosen out of a certain venerable Body in the Nature of a Jury of Matrons to examine whether the Person be qualified according to Law  Secondly  As the  Jews  are known to be possessed of overgrown Riches and as no Lottery can be vigorously carried on without their Concurrence whenever Sir  John Barnard  or any Patriot inclinable to Christianity shall devise a Scheme to prevent Impositions from StockJobbers it will be adviseable to let nobody into the Subscription but the abovementioned  Jews  who certainly cannot grow too rich as our Regard for them will increase in Proportion to their Pelf  Thirdly  I am of Opinion that it is prejudicial to this Kingdom to exclude the said  Jews  from Employments Civil and Military because as they have no other Country of their own it is highly probable that they will love  England  or  Judaea Nova  with an Excess of Zeal and if they were appointed to supply our Army and Navy with Provisions upon all Emergencies it will certainly be perfectly agreeable to the Taste of our Soldiery and our Mariners to be fed with Beef cured by a  Jew  Butcher Aboard the Fleet particularly it will infallibly be pleasing to have a Mess of Beef with a Label of stamped Lead upon it to convince the Men that it has been duly cured And further instead of making Men of Merit Knights of the  Bath  or promoting them to such like Honours suppose they were to be distinguished  Secundum ordinem Melchizedec  by the Order of  Melchizedec  it would not be an improper Institution But this I submit to better Judgments  Fourthly  and  Lastly  I humbly propose that an Army may be speedily raised for the Retaking  Jerusalem  which happy Event would enable our good Friends and now Countrymen the  Israelites  to rebuild their Temple by which Means they would entirely overturn the only Obstacle which now remains towards dissipating those Errors which have misguided People these seventeen Hundred fifty three Years past And I hope the bad Success of that great Man  Julian the Apostate

Sense and yet notwithstanding the frequent Usage of this Phrase I will  e upon me to say there is not a Term in the  English  Language so little understood or made use of in so many vagueSignifications The Cause of this Variety of Conception is to be imputed to the various Lot of human Life in which most People derive their Stock of Ideas from the Occupation they have been accidentally thrown into from whence they acquire such confined Habits of thinking that they have no Power of Reflection out of the beaten Path and most Things are by them determined  according to their partial Survey of Men and Manners  I have somewhere read of a People residing in a small Town situate in the Midst of the  Alps  with whom the principal Constituent of Beauty is a swelling Prominence of Flesh in the Throat by them called a  Gother  and it is recorded that when when an  English  Gentleman remarkable for all the Graces of manly Beauty was passing by on his Travels to  Italy  these Virtuosos observed that he was of an elegant Form and would really be very handsome if had but a  Gother  In like Manner we daily meet with as notable Opinions relating to the Intellects

a Character As I conceive it the Term  Sense  is derived from the Organs of bodily Sensation which when in due Order give to the Mind an immediate Information of the Qualities inherent in natural Bodies from thence the Phrase is transsferred to the human Mind and denotes a quick Power of Perception in the Understanding upon all Occurrences in Life Were I to define a Man of Sense I should call

Way of thinking who delivered in his Sermon that "a Shilling is a serious Thing" and a cold languid unimpassioned Temper are the principal Ingredients in the Composition of the Man of Business while Persons of quick Understanding will always have lively Sensations which must at Times hurry them into Scenes of Action astonishing to the sober Shopkeeper or the sedate Bookkeeper but it should be remembered that Passions are the Gales of Life and that to be divested of them is so far from denoting a sensible Mind that it is a Proof of lamentable Dullness  and Stupidity I shall conclude this Paper with two short Characters drawn from real Life  Avarus  was bound to a Trade at fourteen Years of Age he cleaned his Master's Shoes laid under the Counter swept the Shop scraped the Threshold mounted on the Leads to clean the Gutter went regularly to the PostOffice with Letters was perfectly well versed in the Rule of Three and had the Merchant's Directory by Heart On  Sundays  he would take a sober Walk to  Islington Newington Paddington  c and when a Frolic seized him he would in the Fulness of his Soul spend his Threepence at  Jenny  's  Whim  As he grew up he became a downright  Stoic  in the Government of his Passions to such a Degree that he was thought at length totally to have extinguished them all except his darling Love of Money which has never ceased to influence his Thoughts In short  Avarus  has been so attentive to the main Chance that he is now flourishing and starving with a large Fortune is determined to sell his Vote at the next Election and is likely in Time to be made Sheriff of  London  Liberalis  was bred at  Westminster  School where he was always famous for a keen Turn at an Epigram and when removed to the University he was thought to have carried with him a great Knowledge of  Greek  and  Latin  While at  Oxford  he enlarged his Mind with useful Studies and cultivated a just and elegant Taste for all polite Literature Being turned of One and twenty he entered himself in the  Temple  where he read the Law with sufficient Application but in order to unbend his Mind he was frequently found dipping into  Shakespear  and it has been said by his Enemies that he never would entirely divest himself of an Attachment to the  Belles Lettres  I have somewhere seen it remarked that a Taste in Reading is apt to infuse the same in Morals which Observation proved fatally true to  Liberalis  and in Consequence of this Turn of Mind he could never  prevail on himself to fall into any mean Practices by which Conduct he soon found himself deserted by his Clients and neglected by the Attorneys and he now remains unsought in his Chambers in the high Road to Poverty in which agreeably to the Way of the World we will leave him to himself

Wildair  in a Circle of his Acquaintance he was talking over the several Occurrences he had met with in his Rambles after Intelligence that Day and as he has a peculiar Dexterity in dressing up a Story in all its most striking Colours without falling into a tedious minute Detail of trivial Circumstances he touched upon many Incidents in a Manner so diverting that he excited a general Mirth in the little Audience that was gathered round him  Wildair  to speak the Truth has something extremely captivating in his Conversation and is of all the Men I know the best turned for Society Though a Fellow of Parts he has never suffered his Spirits to subside into a serious Habit of thinking but in a superficial Way glides over every Thing that offers in Company no Subject comes amiss to him and be it what it will he has always something to say for himself which Circumstance joined to a sprightly Delivery contributes greatly to enliven his Company He frequently rallies a Gentleman of our intimate Acquaintance on this Head and will tell him frankly  I know  Jack  you are a sensible Fellow in the main but as you manage Matters your Friends must study hard to find it out  take my Word for it the World is very superficial and a Facility of dismissing every Subject in a brisk Manner will make a Person pass for a Knowing one at the same Time that it renders him sociable and of course agreeable  This is my worthy Friend  Wildair  's Way of thinking and upon this Plan he acquits himself so well that he is extremely sought by his Acquaintance and whenever they lay hold of him it is difficult for him to elude their Solicitations for a Party of Pleasure This was the Case with him the other Night and as I was paying my Debt at the Bar he made up to me and with a Whisper told me That if I would make one of the Company it would furnish me with Hints for some future Essay In vain I reminded him that it was Club Night and his Turn to possess the Chair this Party he assured me would afford higher Entertainment I yielded to his Sollicitations and I must say that my Manner of spending the Evening has supplied me with Materials the like of which never came in my Way before  Before I proceed farther into the Business it may not be improper in Imitation of the Writers for the Stage to give a Degree of Insight into the Characters of the  Dramatis Personae  The Reader is already acquainted with my Disposition and Way of thinking and he also knows Mr  Wildair  The rest of the Company consisted of a MAN OF WIT a MAN OF HUMOUR a DAMN'D HONEST FELLOW and a Person of a very elegant Appearance a cool sedate Temper and extremely decent and polite in his Deportment With this Set I shifted the Scene from the  Bedford  to the  Shakespear  's  Head  and upon entering the Tavern the HONEST FELLOW alarmed the House by calling for a Room with great Vociferation which being shewed to us with the utmost Attention he ordered a Brace of Bottles of the right Sort immediately filled a Round  of Bumpers and roared out "Come let's be jolly  Ranger  ""dmn your musty Books"  let's sit down  This I had no Objection to but as I was attempting to do it the MAN OF HUMOUR with infinite Pleasantry removed the Chair that was placed for me the Consequence of which was that to the great Surprize of the whole Company I was brought to the Ground As I received a Contusion in the Fall I could not entirely relish the Joke but it gave infinite Satisfaction to almost all the rest and they agreed that it really was a very good Thing as good a Thing as ever they had known "Immense by Gd" says the HONEST FELLOW "a glorious Hum" says the WIT while my humorous Friend with a dry Composure of Countenance denoting something between Jest and Earnest begged my Pardon and then officiously offered to settle my Wig and this he did in such a facetious Position and such a whimsical Stare of the Curls that thence was deducible a new Flow of Mirth which amidst the Bursts of Joy that stunned my Ears he enjoyed in a sober Manner Humour being ever grave and sedate  Wildair  perceiving by this Time that I did not approve my Company came over to me and begged I would see it out and squeezing my Hand he added from  Virgil  Forsan haec olim meminisse juvabit  This had so much Prevalence with me that I agreed and the HONEST FELLOW shewed away egregiously The Bottle went round at so brisk a Rate that my Eyes began to dance in my Head like Wildfire By all that's Burgundy says he  Harris  is the best Pimp in  England  Here Waiter call  Harris Enter Harris Harris  dmn your old Soul get us a fine Girl""There's a fine Girl please your Honour at a Place I knowno body has seen her but  Lord Shallow  and myselfand there's  Betty Connor  just arrived from  Dublin  'Squire  M'Hazard  brought her with him she has fine Flesh and Blood please your Honourmost of the  Irish  Wenches have please your Honourand if your Honour chuses it I fancy I have a Bait will bring her out  This Proposal was universally received and in a short Time the Lady was ushered into the Room not without some Glances mutually interchanged between her and  Harris  The MAN OF HUMOUR and the WIT immediately began to play her off as they called itBut as it is a Rule among good Writers never to enlarge too much upon any Subject and to leave something for the Imagination of the Reader to supply I shall upon this Occasion conform to the Precept and will only add that the Lady in the Space of about half an Hour drank and sung and laughed and cried and danced and sat and talked and said nothing with the most surprizing Quickness in the Vicissitude till at length the HONEST FELLOW swore that she spoiled good Fellowship andabruptly desired her to take half a Guinea at the Bar and withdraw which Madam performed after several Te hes and Titters  This Matter being settled we were suddenly surprized with the most enlivening Melody accompanied by a sprightly Voice that plainly and musically articulated  Non toujours dire non c  It seems one of those fair Natives of  Savoy  who are goodnatured enough to undergo the Fatigue of a long Journey in order to make our Public Streets harmonious was placed in the Yard with private Instructions to entertain us with the vocal and instrumental Strain By this our Spirits received a fresh Reinforcement and the MAN OF WIT immediately threw his Wig out of the Window bounced over the Table broke several Bottles and Glasses and alarmed me with a most intolerable Rap on the Shoulders The  MAN OF HUMOUR expressed his Approbation with a dry Joke the HONEST FELLOW pushed the  Burgundy  about and the decent Gentleman whom the Reader will recollect I mentioned in the Beginning of this Paper smiled with the most winning Complacence This Personage has hitherto made no Figure in this  Symposium  the Fact is he did not drink above six Glasses of Wine during the whole Night but now his Heart seemed to dilate his Eyes sparkled with the most vivid Lustre and in the Chearfulness of his Soul he held out his Fist to the Company and  Come says he Odd or Even for this little Silver  The Spirits of almost every one present were ready to flow into any Channel and Gaming became the general Amusement Cards were immediately rung for to play at Brag and after a few Rounds the ELEGANT POLITE MAN produced a Box and Dice out of his Pocket and I believe he will hardly forgive me for desiring a Bill at Five in the Morning as he was in a tolerable Run and had picked up about seventy Pounds However with some Reluctance he condescended to collect the Reckoning which as soon as every Body paid his Proportion he carefully put into his Pocket and desired his Friend  Tomkyns  to place the whole to his Account  This being adjusted in order to compleat this Evening the MAN OF HUMOUR proposed a Scheme which he said would afford more Pleasantry than he had ever known  Itis says he the luckiest Thought in the Worlda betterneneverenter edinto aMan'sHeadlet us tofs up who shallbeththrownout ofthe Window for the frolfrolick sake  I was very much averse from this Piece of Merriment but being overruled by the Company it was immediately done and the Lot fell to my Friend  Wildair  who was instantly surrounded and the HONEST FELLOW opened the Window not without violent Roaring while the  DECENT MAN still continued at the Table throwing the Dice and saying to himself "Seven's the Main" I really believe the Coroner's Inquest would have sat on  Wildair  's Body at Ten o'Clock in the Morning had not the timely Interposition of sober Entreaty begged him off  Upon this I made my Escape and I do not know when I spent an Evening in a Manner that has given me such Reflections The MAN OF WIT I suppose has acquired his Notions of Things from Sir  Richard Blackmore  who tells us that Wit consists in regular and exalted Ferments or from Mr  Dennis  who defines it a Motion of furious Joy and Pride of Soul upon Conception of an Hint for indeed this Gentleman has certainly very exalted Ferments and most surprizing Motions upon the Conception of his Hints I shall take Occasion in some ensuing Essay to undeceive him by giving the Ideas I have formed to myself of the Talent he professes and in my next Lucubration I shall endeavour to convince the MAN OF HUMOUR that he is wide of the Character he would be thought to possess As HUMOUR is a Subject of some Difficulty I shall endeavour to treat it with Perspicuity and I beforehand beg some Mercy of the Critics  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Parnassus  June    THIS Day arrived a Mail from  Robert Dodsley  at  Tully's Head  in  Pallmall  which among other Things brought a Poem called  Translation  directed to the Lord  Roscommon  who immediately assembled all the Wits to sit in Judgment upon the Performance The principal Persons present were  Horace Vida Boileau  the Duke of  Buckingham  Mr  Pope  and Mr  Addison  The latter told the Company that the  English  Language  can now boast four admirable Pieces of Criticism in Verse  viz Roscommon's Essay on translated Verse Buckingham's Art of Poetry Pope's Essay on Criticism  and the Poem then before them intitled  Translation  It was sent to  Socrates  for his Perusal and he conceived Hopes that an Author of so just a Taste would give the World an elegant Version of his own Tragedies After this  Ben Johnson  made Enquiry after a certain Reverend Gentleman who is at present preparing an Edition of his Works with Notes Critical and Explanatory  Old Ben  expressed some Impatience to see it finished as he said it would not fail to render all his Plays more palatable to a modern Taste when this Gentleman has illustrated the Allusions to the Customs and Manners of the Times  Now you talk of Commentators says  Shakespear  to his Friend  Johnson  give me Leave in a Bumper of  Helicon  to drink to the Health of my best CommentatorHere's little  Garrick  to you He has done me more Service than all of them  Ben Johnson  pledged the Toast on account of his Performances in  Abel Drugger  and  Kitely  He's a Man of  brave Notions  says he and so here's his Health not forgetting  Harry Woodward for playing Bobadil so well  Hereupon the Meeting broke up and each Genius withdrew to his favourite Laurel Grove reflecting with Pleasure upon each other's Merit in the literary World  NUMB  GRAY'SINN  Saturday  July    pòpulumque falsis  Dedocet uti  Vocibus  HOR  _IT has been long since recommended to the Tribe of Criticks to adjust and settle their Ideas in a clear and regular Order by fixing the distinct Meaning annexed to each Term they make use of in conveying their Remarks If this Advice was properly adhered to it would cut Matters very short in all Debates which arise upon Points of Literature and would enable those who aspire to the Province of Criticism to pass their Judgment with Precision But the Reverse of this is frequently the Case and I shall at present single out two Expressions from a Multitude of others which appear to me to be used in a vague random Manner the determinate Meaning of either not being sufficiently ascertained  The Terms I mean are an HUMOURIST and a MAN OF HUMOUR They are thought by what I find synonymous by many People which must be the Source of numberless Mistakes To define each may be perhaps Matter of some Difficulty but if I understand them right the Reader is welcome to what Light I can give him into the Matter  An HUMOURIST I take to be one under the Influence of some remarkable Oddity or unaccountable Whim which has taken such strong Possession of the  Mind and has so insinuated itself into all its Operations that it mixes with the common Train of his Ideas and thereby gives such a Cast to his Way of thinking that every Thing strikes him in a different Light from the rest of his FellowCreatures and of Consequence every Thing he does is also in an extravagant Manner  I have not been able to investigate in any Historian the first Appearance of this Species of Men in this Kingdom Whether it was in the Nature of the  Aborigines  or first Inhabitants of this Island or whether it made its Inroad among us with that general Conflux of different Nations which landed here is a Point not very easy to determine One Thing is clear that they are of a long Standing among us and indeed they thrive with such large Increase in this our Soil that there is room to apprehend the whole Nation will shortly become a Nation of odd Fellows  Besides the many Extravagancies which this Set of Men are addicted to they have all a strange Notion that they must have their own Way Mr  Congreve  has observed that there is a Proverb by which they are in a great Measure governed  He that will have a Maypole shall have a Maypole  They are entirely attached to the Gratification of their own particular Bent their Imaginations have contracted such whimsical Habits that they see Things through a Medium to which Men of a more reasonable Turn are Strangers and thence it results that wild and fantastick Opinions are delivered upon all Topics and their Conduct is nothing but a Series of Inconsistencies  The Person who falls into this Way of thinking is properly speaking an HUMOURIST and  Quidquid vult valde vult  should be the Motto of every one of them they being all inflexible in Pursuit of their Inclinations It is a trite Remark that the Spirit of Liberty and Independency which is diffused throughout this Kingdom  contrioutes very much to feed this odd Turn and to promote its Growth I have mixed frequently in the Meetings of  Humourists  in order to animadvert upon their Ways and have always observed that none of them will suffer themselves to be controuled for this exceilent Reason because  Dmn my Blood I can club my Reckoning as well as any Man and I have been an Housekeeper Man and Boy these thirty or forty Years and I pay my Rent and so a Fig for King  G    Thus while the HUMOURIST has his Property secured to him by the salutary Laws of our noble Constitution he will enjoy his Independency to give a Proof of which he thinks it essential to have a Value for no Man and to please himself though at the Expence of his Company is his darling Delight  It is to the Observation of these Oddities that we owe the MAN OF HUMOUR and hence is deducible a Definition or rather Description of his Character He is one who  Eyes Natures Walks  as Mr  Pope  sinely phrases it and  catches the Manners living as they rise  He sees the Pololes which have taken Root in the Man and the many motly Circumstances which adhere to him He looks as it were into his very mind perceives there the Jaundice through which every Thing pa  es and from whence all Objects derive their Hue he sees the Imagination tinged with this strange Dye and all the Affections of the Soul discoloured by it He views such Traces formed in his Brain that it is rendered quite different from that of any other human Creature and thus the MAN OF HUMOUR perceives the secret and internal Springs of Action which lead on the HUMOURIST he cannot help smiling to see the Operations of his Soul so extravagant and being acquainted with the latent Cause of those odd Appearances which disclose themselves upon all Occasions he afterwards represents them to the World in true and lively Colours  Thus may the two Characters in Question be described though they have been so much mistaken by many People The Confusion I apprehend is owing to the vague Use of the Word HUMOUR which is promiscuously applied to both It is common to say of the HUMOURIST he has his Humour or it is his Humour and of the humourous Man we assert that he has a great Fund of Humour In both Cases the Phrase carries with ta different Sense denoting in the former Instance the Foible or Whim which operates upon the Man's Conduct and in the latter signifying that Pleasantry which represents the odd Fellow in a diverting Light The Poverty of our Language has introduced this ambiguous Use of the Word but if People would be carefur to acquire Perspicuity in their Ideas and the Terms they express them by it would prevent much Perplexity and Confusion  For Instance it would be absurd in any Critic to call the inimitable Mr  Fielding  an HUMOURIST but he who would pronounce him to be a Man of exquisite Humour would I believe express something more pertinent to the Point In like Manner Mr  Hogarth  has exhibited in his Pieces with the most masterly Strokes of his Pencil an whole Set of  Humourists  and the ingenious Artist who thus enchant our Eye is undoubtedly a MAN OF HUMOUR  There is another Cause to which in my Opinion this Mistake has been greatly owing it frequently happens that a MAN OF HUMOUR is at the same Time in some Measure an HUMOURIST himself These two Characters thus blended together have often a very happy Effect and serve to heighten each other This we Experience in  Shaiespear  's  Falstaff  in whom we find united in a pleasing Assemblage the mixed Qualities of these two different Characters Sir  John  's Love of Plunder his Pretensions to Deeds of Hardiness his Aversion to Cowards and his moralizing on the Manners  of the Age cannot but appear whimsical when we consider that he is sitter to drink Sack and unbutton him after Dinner than to attempt Feats of Prowess that he is an accomplished Coward in his Heart and that his Way of Life is quite abandoned and dissolute These are the Circumstances which denote him an odd Fellow but his quick Perception of the Foibles of his Neighbours and his Vivacity in exhibiting them in a ridiculous Point of View are the Qualities which constitute him a MAN OF HUMOUR This last Circumstance I apprehend makes Sir  John  a Favourite with every Body and endears him to all the Sons of Merriment and in this if I mistake not lies the chief Difference between  Shakespear  and  Ben Johason  The Characters produced by the latter are always disagreeably odd their Whims are so extravagant that they sometimes deserve rather the Name of Madmen and there is hardly any Thing in any of them that would induce a Gentleman to spend an Evening with them  It requires a close Knowledge of the World to exhibit Personages of this Cast on the Stage Every Idea that rises in the Mind of an odd Fellow his various Ways of Thinking and Inconsistencies must be the constant Object of the Poets Attention and he must be careful to give to each his specific Language The Player must not only be acquainted with the human Heart and human Understanding but he has also a farther Step to take He must Watch the HUMOURIST in every Circumstance his Manner of Delivery his Tone of Voice the Cast of his Eye his every Gesture and Attitude must fall immediately under his Inspection and to all this he must add the rare Talent of concealing his Art  In this Point I am apt to think Mr  Woodward  excellent as he is from an Overwarmth of Spirit sometimes deficient I would submit it to himself whether his Feeling  of the Whimsies of some Characters is not now and then too lively and whether his Sensations do not carry him so far in some Passages as to make it visible that he is conscious of the Oddity of the Appearance even while he is personating the ManHis  Bobadil  is one of the Exceptions to this Remark and his not permitting his Fancy to run into Riots in that Part has so sine an Effect that I am persuaded were healways equally upon his Guard his greatest Enemy would have nothing to do but to admire him  Whoever has seen Mrs  Pritchard  in  Beatrice  in  Maria  in  Clarinda  c will recollect such lively and acknowledged Touches of Nature as can hardly be equalled unless the Pleasantry of Mrs  Clive  in her very humourous Walk of Comedy may be deemed to rival them  I cannot conclude without Mention of Mr  Garrick  who is certainly admirable in every Species of acting In Tragedy his Power over the Passions is too well known to be here insisted on and in Comedy every Thing is impressed by him on his Audience with the nicest Skill and in such Parts as  Benedict  and Sir  John Brute  he is at once an  Humourist  and a  Man of Humour  with the most diverting Pleasantry I shall dismiss this Paper after applying the Words of Mr  Pope  on this Occasion "He is not more a Master of  the  great  than of the  ridiculous  in human Nature of our noblest Tendernesses than of our vainest Foibles of our strongest Emotions than of our idlest Sensations  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Richard's Coffeehouse TempleBar  July    AMONG the Accounts which Mr  Ranger  gave of the various Academies in this Metropolis we are not a little surprized that he did not take Notice of this Place For tho' we value ourselves upon the Reputation of our Coffee we think we have no less  Reason to

 Saturday  July    O matre pulchrâ filia pulchrior  HOR  To  CHARLES RANGER  Esq  SIR  _IF I remember right you some Time since recommended the Maxim of an old  Greek  Philosopher who lays it down as a Rule that we should not suffer any Thing in Life to take too strong an Hold of our Imagination because that Power of the Mind is found to have a very considerable Influence upon all our Sentiments and all our Actions Certainly  when the Reins are thrown loose upon the Neck of ungoverned Fancy we become instantly addicted to what is called in the common Phrase  CastleBuilding  than which there is not a more dangerous Exercise of our intellectual Faculties It is a continual roving of our Thoughts to ideal Scenes of Joy Pleasure is our Pursuit and when it does not appear within our Reach we catch at the Shadow instead of the Substance we ramble into a kind of Fools Paradise and lounge away our Hours in the imaginary Gardens of a dreaming  Eficurus  from whence it results that the Sinews of the Understanding become relaxed an enervating Stillness spreads over all the Powers of the Soul which is constantly dissolved in Luxury of its own Creation fond Selflove holds up to us a pleasing Picture throws some Joys into Perspective flings what is disagreeable into Shades and totally hides from us the thorny Parts of the Landskip These perhaps may be accounted Pleasures but they are in the main like the visionary Ideas excited by taking  Laudanum  at the same Time that they administer a Flow of Spirits they invade our Nerves and render us entirely unfit for any Sphere of Action  An Instance of this intoxicating Power of  CastleBuilding  I have observed for some Time past in Mrs  Vainlove  who has spent the greatest Part of her Life in a waking Dream and can hardly be accounted one of this World as she has been in the general quite abstracted from Society and has dwelt mostly in the airy Regions of Fancy Mrs  Vainlove  in the greener Part of her Life was flattered into a Notion of her own Beauty by which Means she became fond of Power Her Eyes she thought gave her a  Right divine  to be a pretty Tyrant over the opposite Sex and as the Imagination never deals out Blessings with a scanty Hand her Sway soon became in Appearance as extensive as her most delusive Hopes could desire But though she  led the whole Race of Man in Captivity she at length condescended to let an ambitious Lover aspire to her Bed The Consequence of this Condescension was that in due Course of Time she was the happy Mother of a fair Daughter in whom she saw her own Features but moulded with greater Delicacy Selflove inclined her to admire this flattering Likeness of herself and the Emanations of Fancy bestowed upon her every Grace Before Miss could walk in the Mother's Eye she danced with all the Elegance of  Auretti  and as soon as her Tongue began to utter imperfect Words  Lord what a deal of Wit the Child has Dear Cousin a'nt you astonished at her 'pon Honour I never taught her that  In Process of Time Miss  Vainlove  devoured up these Expressions of Admiration with a greedy Ear and she began insensibly to believe every Word perfectly true till at length her Imagination took the very same Turn which had distorted the Thoughts of her Mother before and a Series of Years instead of banishing the Deceit but served to give a stronger Tincture to her Fancy  When  Virgil  's  Dido  is crossed in Love and she finds herself upon the Point of being deserted by the  Trojan  Prince her ready Fancy seizes the Occasion to disturb her with visionary Scenes of Solitude in which she thinks herself abandoned and forlorn  Semperque relinqui  Sola sibi semper longam incomitata videtur  Ire Viam  But with Miss  Vainlove  the Cafe is quite reversed though it should happen that her Fate removes her from the dear Society of Man though the sudden Excrescence of a Pimple on her Face or Neck should doom her a Recluse until her Skin regains its native Alabaster Smoothness though an untractable Lock should refuse  to join in amicable Confederacy with the Rest of her Headdress and determine her in a Fit of Peevishness to sequester herself from the World yet still she reigns Queen of the Assembly and has a Circle of Beaux about her the ideal Footman's Rap sounds Transport to her Ear and she is every Instant receiving the Homage of contending Lovers who have no Existence but in her own Brain Her Mother confirms her in the Deception and through the Force of Habit they are constantly amused with Pictures of their own Creation like those who Mr  Locke  tells us in his Treatise on the  Conduct of the Understanding  through some Distemperature in their Blood or any other internal Cause see a Variety of Colours passing continually before them and frequently perceive a Groupe of human Figures Soldiers and Combatants marching in Procession before the deluded Eye of distempered Fancy  Miss  Vainlove  has carried Matters to such an Extreme that she really thinks herself the most celebrated Toast about Town at present  Ryan  at the  King's Arms  is under infinite Obligations to her for the plentiful Libations of Burgundy which have been poured out to her Beauty at his House and almost all the Taverns in the Cities of  London  and  Westminster  have felt in this Way the happy Influence of her Beauty  Her Footman has the best Place in  England  because as she has taken it into her Head he is in the constant Receipt of Bribes at all public Places to induce him to tell the Name of his young Mistress and the Place of her Abode Madam  La Place  owes a great deal of her Success in Business to Miss  Vainlove  's having the Lead of all the Fashions and directing the Ladies of her Acquaintance to her Milliner that they may set themselves off with the same Advantages of Ornament  Miss  Vainlove  without having one real Lover has constantly a large Number of fancied Slaves to her  Frowns and Smiles and from thence it happens that she looks upon all the Women as a Set of Creatures that envy her and the Men she considers as her Votaries fit for nothing but to grace her Triumph There is nothing more common with her than to be within a few Days of being married to a Man of large Fortune even when she never exchanged a Word with him  Well to be sure says she it's surprizing how Things are whispered about the common Report is that I am to be married to Mr  Whatdo yecallhim  without Doubt it is in my PowerbutLord the whole Town has it  It is in vain to assure her that the Town does not trouble its Head about her her Mother has told her she does not meet so fine a Woman any where and so the Opiate works I met both these egregious Characters at  Vauxhall  a few Nights since when they informed me that the whole Set of foreign Ambassadors were now in the young Ladies Train and that **** who is a Man of Consequence and Forture in the Country which he represents is absolutely expiring for Miss  Vainlove  It happened that after this I paid her several Visits and never meeting any of her florid Retinue I took the Liberty to mention that I never had the Pleasure of seeing her gay Set of Enamoratos to this Mrs  Vainlove  replied that she had given them their Answer  Whenever we give them their Answer they never come again  Thus these two Ladies never see any Thing in its proper Colour they think their Dreams Realities and like mad People are constantly reasoning right from wrong Principles Pray Mr  Ranger  minister to a Mind diseased as  Shakespear  phrases it let them know that they cannot subsist very long upon such airy Pleasures as they imagine to themselves and convince them that there is great Truth in what is said perhaps too loosely by the comic Poet  There's nought but willing waking

several Performances in Criticism with which  Voltaire  has introduced into the World his various poetical Compositions That excellent Author has the Modesty to call most of these short Essays by the Name of  Fugitive Pieces of Literature  But the smallest Productions of so pleasing a Writer are indelible and will be read with Pleasure while there remains any Taste for a fine Turn of Sense and an elegant Felicity of Expression When I observe thus much I would not have it imagined that I perceive any Traces of Infallibility about him In the general his Remarks are deduced from Nature and  Aristotle  and on most Occasions he delivers himself with a sound Judgment but in my late cursory Review of his Writings I think I have met with some Passages which demand the Animadversion of a Writer who pretends to instruct or entertain his Readers In the Discharge of this Task I think I cannot acquit myself in a better Form than that of a Letter to the Author this I shall endeavour to do with that Politeness which is due to such an extensive Genius  and I make no Doubt but the  English Reader  will concur with me in the few Observations which I shall submit to his Perusal  To Monsieur  VOLTAIRE  SIR  THE Republic of Letters has happily removed that aukward Distance and that extreme Difficulty of Access which Policy ministerial Artifice and insolent Pride have established in the ordinary Intercourse of Life by which Means it has obtained that the easy Seasons of Application the  mollia tempora fandi  are at all times allowed to every Member of the serene Republic already mentioned and while Decency and good Manners are preserved an easy Habitude subsists between the highest and the lowest of that august Body Freedom of Converse is the happy Collision which has struck out so many new Lights in every Thing relating to the Sciences and the liberal Arts and it has been observed that there is no Book so mean but some useful Hint may possibly be derived from it On this Account it may be proper to wave all Offers at an Apology for the Liberty an unknown Writer allows himself in addressing a Letter to so enlightened a Genius I shall only premise on this Occasion that I take the Pen in Hand with that Respect to which you are certainly entitled by the Superiority of your Parts but as I have taken Exceptions to some Criticisms scattered up and down in your Writings I cannot suppress a very strong Inclination of making some Remarks upon them  I have observed Sir that you are apt to reprobate the  English  Stage with some Degree of Acrimony whenever it comes in your Way and that you have not hesitated to make free with our immortal  Shakespear  after a Manner which in my Opinion is inconsistent  with that Relish for manly Sense which seems to be your Characteristic and in a Stile which to me appears destitute of your usual Delicacy If I should say that the boasted  Bienséance  of your Country has relinquished you in some of these Passages I flatter myself that upon a Review of them you will not totally disavow it The most striking of the various Judgments which you have vented against the greatest Dramatic Genius in the World is found in your Discourse prefixed to your Tragedy of  Semiramis  and is literally translated into  English  as follows  I do not mean to justify the Tragedy of  Hamlet  in every Particular it is in Fact a barbarous Piece abounding with such gross Absurdities that it would not be tolerated by the Vulgar in  France  and  Italy  The Hero of the Play runs mad in the second Act and his Mistress meets with the same Misfortune in the third The Prince takes  Ophelia  's Father for a Rat and kills him and in Despair she throws herself into a River Her Grave is dug on the Stage and the GraveDigger with a Skull in his Hand amuses himself with a String of miserable Jests while the Prince answers them in Language equally disgusting  Hamlet  his Mother and FatherinLaw drink together on the Stage They divert themselves with BottleSongs  Chansons à boire  they quarrel they fight and kill One would imagine this Play the Production of a drunken Savage And yet among these Absurdities which render the  English  Drama absolutely barbarous there are some Strokes in  Hamlet  worthy of the most exalted Genius This has always been Matter of Astonishment to me it looks as if Nature in pure Sport diverted herself with mixing in  Shakespear  's Head every thing sublime and great with all that can be conceived low mean and detestable  It is thus the elegant and sensible  Voltaire  speaks of  Shakespear  I would submit it to yourself Sir whether this Criticism is candid and whether it is a fair Discussion of the Tragedy in Question We do not concern ourselves in this Country with what is agreeable to the Taste of the Vulgar in  France  or  Italy  we know that the  Clinquant  of an Opera or a  Comedie Ballet  is more acceptable to their Refinement than the sterling Bullion of an  English  Performance but we might expect from a Writer of Eminence a truer and more exact Opinion  Hamlet  Sir does not run mad though if he did King  Lear  has proved what a beautiful Distress might arise from it he counterfeits Madness for his own private End but no body ever imagined that he thinks he is killing a Rat when he slays  Polonius  If you will be pleased to recollect the Passage you will find that he takes him for his Better meaning the King and that the Rat is only mentioned to save Appearances  That  Ophelia  's Grave is dug on the Stage cannot be refuted but that very Indecorum produces so many fine Reflections and such an excellent Vein of Morality as perhaps cannot be parallel'd by the  Scene Francoise  and is without doubt warmer and more interesting than the frigid unimpassioned Declamation of a more correct Writer I cannot recollect that  Hamlet  ever shocked me with miserable Jests upon this Occasion not do I remember that any of them are such honest Bottle Companions as to carouse and sing merry Catches on the Stage Pray consider Sir that our Language though no way inferior to the  French  is not universally understood Abroad and from your Representation of Matters it may be inferred that our great Poet is really the  drunken Savage  you have thought proper to call him This would be derogating from the greatest Poet the World has ever seen since the Days  of  Homer  and I believe you will grant is dealing unfairly with a Man whom you cannot but reverence  When you confess that he has many Flights of the highest Elevation you make an Approach towards justice but I cannot help thinking that you are somewhat like a Painter who lays on just and proper Colouring and then instantly effaces it when you and that you are astonished at his sublime Excursions of Fancy I should have expected from your Candour that you would rather have said it is a Pity that he who soared to such glorious Heights should ever tire his Eagle Wing and fall beneath himself You may remember that it is with this good Temper  Longinus  talks of  Homer  they are Dreams says he but they are the Dreams of  Homer  He might perhaps with as much Propriety as you have given the Appellation of a  drunken Savage  have called him AN OLD DOTARD and asserted that some of his long Stories are detestable but a candid Critic forgives the Imbecilities of human Nature and passes Sentence like a mild and goodnatured Judge  Cum tabulis animum censoris sumet honesti  HOR  In one of your Letters concerning the  English  Nation you are greatly pleased with a Saying of the late Lord  Bolingbroke  in Relation to the Duke of  Marlborough  "He was" replied that ingenious Nobleman when his Opinion was asked "so great a Man that I "have forgot his Faults" Something like this might be your Judgment upon  Shakespear  and it was more particularly incumbent on you to treat his Memory with respect because I apprehend you owe very great Obligations to him in many of your own dramatic Writings We frequently perceive you lighting your Torch at his Fire in your  Mahomet Macbeth marshals you the Way that you are going  in many other Scenes  we can catch your Eye fixed upon our immortal Bard and in your  Semiramis  you have adventured to introduce a Ghost in Imitation of the very Play which has occasioned the Severity already cited The Success you met with upon that Occasion might serve to convince you of  Shakespear  's inimitable Merit The  Parterre  if I mistake not turned their Backs to the Stage and blew their Noses while the Ghost on our Theatre never fails to impress an awful Stillness on every Mind This Sir give me leave to assure you is not owing to the Barbarity of our Taste but to the amazing Power of our Poet's Imagination which could explore the undiscovered Regions of Eternity and recal the slecting Spirit with a Solemnity of Ideas responsive to the Occasion  Shakespear  is a kind of established Religion in Poetry and his Bays will always stourish with undiminished Verdure When I say this I am not for maintaining that he is not guilty of Transgressions but for every Transgression he recompences his Auditors with Beauties which no Art will ever equal That the Rules established by  Aristotle  and  Horace  are agreeable to Nature I am ready to allow and that inferior Geniuses may avail themselves by a skilful Conformity to them I as freely assent to But Fable is but a secondary Beauty the Exhibition of Character and the Excitement of the Passions justly claiming the Precedence in dramatic Poetry It is in Writing as in Gardening where Natures does not afford spontaneous Beauties recourse must be had to the Embellishments of slow endeavouring Art to the Regularity of uniform Vistas the Intricacy of elaborated Mazes and a studied Insertion of Evergreens but when the Course of the Country of itself presents attractive Scenes on every Side when the Trees branch out with a free Expansion and the bold Prospect surprizes with the Heath the Lawn the Hill  and Valley in wild Variety the Littleness of tedious Culture is unnecessary and trifling Ornaments are unlooked for  I shall conclude with a Passage from your own Works  Do not blush Sir to repent of your little Inadvertencies It is hard but it is amiable to acknowledge our Errors  Ne rougissez point Monsiour de vous  repentir de vos petites

cogis  Auri sacra famcs  VIRG  _THE Desire of acquiring Money has in all Ages actuated Mankind and influenced their Conduct in various Shapes ever since civil Polity framed different States and Republics and since Convenience stamped an imaginary Value upon yellow Dirt which soon rendered it by general  Consent a proper Exchange for the rest of the Commodities of the Earth By the same Means that it became useful in the ordinary Necessaries of Life it also in Proportion administered to the Luxuries and magnificent Enjoyments of Society The Gamester soon learned to carry a thousand Head of Cattle by Proxy to the Dice Room so many Pieces of Ore became the Representatives of an adequate Number of Trees and Things went on in this Progression till at length a modern Beau could carry as many sparkling Acres upon his little Finger as would have strained a thousand  Alaxes  and  Hectors  of the Days of  Homer  This last Remark I am proud to Fave an Opportunity of making as the elegant Species just mentioned have for some Time unjustly been exposed to the RailJery of the Epilogue to the  Distressed Mother  whereas by this Account the pretty Fellows of these Times have very visibly a Superiority over the Prowess and Vigour of the much boasted antient Heroes  But to return An Ambition to amass Riches is certainly very laudable when it does not transgress the Bounds which are prescribed by Reason to all our Passions in the general While it is conducted with a View to a Competency and the Enjoyment of the Requisites for Subsistence and Comfort while it operates with a Propensity to a Man's Friends Relations and as  Milton  has it all the Charities of Father Son and Brother and while it is the Source of Generosity and an extensive Power of distributing Benefits to Mankind it is without any Manner of Doubt a just Principle of Action and though Selflove is the Pebble which stirs the Lake the Circles which it occasions will always be pleasing and beautiful to the moral Sense  But the Misfortune is this Affection generally degenerates into Meanness and has a fatal Tendency to  ruin the Understanding and to corrupt the Heart The intellectual Soil must not lie fallow for any long Time together and it is by Freedom of Converse and an habitual Intercouse with the enlightened Part of the World that a mental Vigour is to be acquired and when the Imagination is constantly attached to a particular Set of Ideas it becomes narrow by insensible Degrees and for Want of that general Survey of the different Objects which are continually passing on the Scene of Life it is confined to a small Compass and never ventures to make the least Excursion further From this close Habit of Thinking the Heart too frequently contracts a lazy Apathy and grows entirely callous to all manner of Sensation Our Passions are involuntary and are nothing else than the Impressions which external Objects usually make upon the human Imagination from the Operations of which we feel those sundry Emotions which are Incitements to spur us on from Theory to Practice and which disclose themselves in our Actions and are thence known to belong to the amiable Train of  Benevolence  or to be of the hateful Family of  Selfishness  and  Illnature  In Proportion therefore as the Ideas which pass in the Mind are scanty the Affections which agitate the Heart will be fewer and both must at last rust to a Point and fix in a State of unfeeling Indolence  A Love of Money is at once the Source of those Deeds which carry with them a splendid Appearance and those also which are at first Sight mean and contemptible This Passion has made many a Writer of Eminence and many Scriblers in a Garret it has animated the General at the Head of an Army and the Clipper of Coin in his twilight Room it has for many Ages thundered in the Senate wrangled at the Bar and lulled from the Pulpit To this it is owing that the Merchant boldly traverses the Globe trusting to all the Dangers of the turbulent Element  and that  Buckhorse  will receive as many severe Strokes of a Cane as you please for Sixpence apiece  The Art generally practised by People who are desirous either to amass an overgrown Fortune or to glean up a Livelihood without the Talents to recommend themselves by striking out some new Discovery or cultivating some advantageous Branch of Trade and Commerce is to impose upon the Credulity of Mankind and by obtruding false delusive Circumstances to excite their Curiosity raise their Admiration and thus guil them to comply with their Artifices of Fraud and Imposition This Metropolis has never wanted a sufficient Number of these Projectors and at present I believe I may affirm that it abounds with Cheats and Impostors in every Station in every Art and Science and in every Circumstance of Life The solemn Physician the specious Lawyer the wordy Critic and the bombast Poet are found in all Quarters of the Town and though they must be allowed to be very notable

are somewhat more plausible than that which I have now touched upon but among them all I do not remember any Plan so well calculated to elevate and surprize to keep up a Stare as a new one which came

SIR  _AS there is a Court of Censorial Enquiry subsisting at  Gray'sInn  under your Influence and as I suppose from the apparent Tendency of it that it was designed in its first Institution to be a secondary Aid to our Courts of Justice by taking Cognizance of those Offences which are not punishable by any of the Statute Laws of this Realm I must take the Liberty to transmit to you an Information of such a Nature that I am convinced you will think it either ought to be laid before the abovementioned Court or that it deserves to be treated with the Touches of your Pen  To enter at once into the Business I must inform you that I lately had Occasion to take a Jant down to  Bath  and imagining that travelling in a StageCoach would not be disagreeable I took a Place in one of those Vehicles which set out from the  Bell Inn  behind the New Church in the  Strand  Precisely at Two in the Morning crack went the Coachman's Whip and off we went with six Passengers It being quite dark at the Hour of starting we began our Journey without so much as knowing one another's Faces and we were protty well jolted on the Stones before we were all properly adjusted in our Places For some Time we were entertained with a Concert of Groans Sighs Coughs and other such agreeable Interjections to fill up the Pause of Conversation till having passed the Turnpike and being arrived to the plain Road the Gentleness of the Motion and the Stillness of the Night composed our Company to sleep as I inferred from the Information of their Noses which did not cease to ply the Ear until the Morning began to tinge the Hemisphere towards the East with white Streaks of Light by the Help of which I could then discover who and who was together Accordingly I perused the Countenances of my FellowTravellers and pretty plainly read in each Visage that very Character which a short Time convinced me was appropriated to each  The First and most remarkable Personage was the Wife of a wealthy Inhabitant of  Thamesstreet  going down to see Life  for it is really says she enough to fill one up with the Vapours to be eternally moped in that odious Part of the Town and as soon as I return I shall prevail upon Mr  Narrowmind  since he has now picked up his Crums to learn a little Taste and remove to some gented Quarter  This Scheme met with the instant Approbation of her next Neighbour a motherly Sort of Woman who lets Lodgings at  Bath  and with whom the polite Citizen was to six her Residence The good old Landlady declared as how she was of Opinion Folks of Mrs  Narrowmind  's Fortune should be accommodated with some Elegance and then turning about  Ma'em will you chuse to taste the Liquor I have brought in this little Bottle  I know by Experience that it is the best Thing in the World to keep Wind out of the Stomach  This Proposal was agreed to and a few Minutes convinced the rest of the Company that a Dram is not only of singular Use to keep Wind out of the Stomach but also a most excellent Expeller of what Wind may be accidentally lodged there  While this agreeable Couple were solacing themselves the Conversation was taken up by one whom we soon discovered to be a  Jew  bound for the Rendezvous of many of the People of Fashion with the double View of partaking of the Diversions of the Place and getting rid of a little  French  Paste which lay upon his Hands He harangued with great Volubility of Speech and he frequently embellished his Discourse with many lively Flashes of a Diamond Ring which played upon his Finger Amidst all his Vivacity he took Care to be sufficiently attentive to the grand Business of selling the abovementioned Paste which was with him so material a Point that he never once mentioned the chief Object which at present engrosses the Thoughts of his whole Nation but instead of favouring us with his political Speculations he amused us with a Sight of numberless pretty Trinkets the Beauties of which he explained with such an artful Display of his Finger and so many Flourishes of Speech that he soon closed a Bargain with the fine Lady whom I have already mentioned  The next Person whom I shall mention was a young Gentleman who from a slender Figure and the Recommendation of five and twenty Years of Age promised himself some Success among the Ladies notwithstanding the late Marriage Act Not having seen a great deal of the World his Mind was raw and uninformed struck with Surprize at every Thing that ofsered and breaking out into idle Questions upon the most minute Occurrence I have often observed that  Memory is a prevailing Faculty in weak Intellects and never fails to prove very troublesome in Company and as most Things when Judgment is wanting are laid up in that Storehouse without Taste or Discernment they are also produced in the same Manner according to the old Proverb  Ill got Ill gone  Having dabbled a little in some of our modern Poets there hardly arose an Incident but what our FellowTraveller would repeat twenty or thirty Verses in a Breath from Sir  Richard Blackmore  the CHOICE or some such ingenious Work and the Misfortune was that what he last recited opened new Traces and he was sure to continue as long as his Memory supplied him like the Man at a Fair who will spew you up Ribband by the Yard while there remains any in his Mouth and this Similitude I take to be very picturesque on the present Occasion with this Difference only that what the latter evacuates does not indicate a bad Digestion whereas the former constantly discovers a foul Stomach which cannot contain its Crudities and on this Account I take your Ribband Spewer to be much the more agreeable Fellow of the two  The fifth and last of the Company as I intend to say nothing of myself was a perfect Contrast to the Character just exhibited as the Dealer in Verse never offered any Thing of his own this Original was determined never to make Use of what came from another's Imagination but depended entirely upon his own Stock for Fame and Feputation There is a Saying of Doctor  Swift  's which in my Opinion would be of singular Use to many in human Life "Never" says that great Genius in a Letter to a young Clergyman  attempt to shew your Wit because it is at least ten Thousand to one that you have none  To this Precept the Gentleman I am now speaking of paid no Kind of Regard his Imagination being constantly upon the Stretch to  elevate  and  surprize  and  all that  to  start new Turns of Fancy upon every Occasion and as it is generally expressed to say good Things It was in vain to tell him that it was not at all incumbent on him to be so extremely brilliant and that his Company did not exact all that Emanation of Genius my Friend could never be content to deliver himself in the ordinary Way and you might perceive him perpetually in deep Study to express himself upon the most trivial Incident  I shall not trouble Mr  Ranger  with any of the smart Prettinesses which escaped from this exalted Wit but having now acquainted you with the Characters of the Company I leave it to your own Imagination to suggest in what Manner the Time must have glided away among People who were all entirely attached to their prevailing Foibles and who thought of nothing but the Gratification of their own particular Humours During the whole Journey the Citizen's Wife talked of nothing but her Taste and Dignity which the good Woman from  Bath  confirmed the VerseSpewer thought of nothing but reciting and the Man of Wit was ambitiously new and lively With regard to the  Jew

several polite Writers against the predominant Fashion among the Ladies of setting off their Charms with the Addition of Paint Our great  Shakespear  has put a very severe Remark into the Mouth of his  Hamlet  in the Scene with  Ophelia Heaven hath given ye one Face and ye make yourselves another  This Thought has been twisted and tortured into a thousand different Shapes by every little Endeavourer at an Epigram for a long Time past and the Custom has been frequently censured as a  olly imported from our Neighbours the  French  As the Art of giving an artificial Tincture to the Skin appears to me to admit of many favourable Circumstances I shall employ this Day's Paper in Vindication of my pretty Countrywomen  It may seem at first an extreme bold Position if I assert that Painting is not an Importation of foreign Refinement but originally of  English  Growth and yet that this is the real State of the Case is sufficiently known to the most super  cial Dabbler in History  Julius Caesar  in his Account of the Inroad which he made upon our Ancestors gives a Description of the  Aborigines  of this Island which I shall here translate  The Britons in general paint their Bodies with Woad which gives a blue  incture to the Skin and lends them a formidable Affect in Battle  This I think may serve to obviate the Imputation of imitating  the  French  in this Particular which I take to be a Point of some Consequence as by this we cannot be charged with the Levity of having servilely copied from others We find that the Ladies among the  British Picts  went entirely naked and painted their Bodies all over with the  Woad  already mentioned This must undoubtedly have afforded great Scope for Fancy and in those Days there must certainly have been many eager Rivalships among the Fair for Preeminence in point of Taste for Painting For as the whole lovely Body was ornamented with different Figures and sundry various Representations according as Imagination suggested the Variety of new Fashions must have been extremely entertaining each Fairone being studious to adapt to each different Part of the Body that Degree of Colouring and that Form which must have proved most becoming just as our modern Ladies adjust a Patch so as to make the Contrast striking and give stronger Expressions to the adjacent Features I have now by me the whole History of a  British Pict Coquette  found by a Friend of mine among some antient Manuscripts and sent to me as a Curiosity  Cassibelana  was the Lady's Name She lived in the Capital of the  Trinobantes  and was remarkable for a fine Stature and an Head of Hair of a surprizing Length flowing in wanting Luxuriance down her Back She always had at her Toilet some of the most exquisite  Woad  that could be any where procured and she was celebrated for her curious Art in preparing it for the Purposes of adorning her Person The  Woad  being of itself of a blucish Cast she would sometimes paint no Part of her Body but where the Veins appeared and to them she gave such a delicate Colouring that the pure and elequent Blood as the Poet calls it seemed to shew itself through her translucent Skin As soon as she had established this Fashion and made the rest of her sex her Imitators she would then suddenly change  the Mode and embellish her whole Body with various Devices  On the left Side of her Breast she would draw a young  Cupid  aiming an Arrow at her Heart and on the Right a Lover languishing in amorous Indolence Each Leg represented an Admirer kneeling at her Feet and imploring her Compassion while she with all the Complacence of selfapproving Beauty let fall her Eyes with Indifference and cold Disdain On her Back were represented the emblematical Figures of a Train of Pages following her in her way with all the Officiousness of careful Attendance On other Parts of her Person was presented to View  Venus  in lovely Attitude emerging from the Sea the  Graces  were also to be seen walking Hand in Hand their Faces brightened with Chearfulness and mutual Love In this Manner she would attend at public Sacrifices where all Eyes were often fixed on her alone and frequently the venerable  Druid  could not avoid even in the Fervour of his Devotion to cast a Glance upon such an attractive Profusion of Charms  In this Manner  Cassibelana  captivated the Hearts of all her male Beholders who carved her Name upon every Oak in the Country and the banks of  Thames  reecchoed to the Musick of her Name It was universally agreed that she was the best Painter of her Age her Colours were warm and glowing her Figures bold and striking and the natural Motion of the different Parts of her Body made them appear still more animated and actuated as it were with the animal Functions of real Life an Advantage which the most admired Portraits of the most eminent Painters since her Days could never boast In all public Places she entirely outshined the rest of her Sex which made her the general Envy of the Ladies who frequently combined in Parties of Scandal to her Disadvantage even though Tea was not then known in these Parts of the World  Cassibelana  was every Day pulled to pieces according to the modern Phrase and though the Ladies allowed that she really had a very lively Fancy in all her Drawings and an excellent Design in all her Drapery yet they could not see that she was so fine a Woman though to be sure she had a pretty Manner  in putting on her Things  for so they expressed the Covering of  Woad  which served to conceal in some Measure the natural Superficies of her Skin I am apt to believe that the transparent Capuchin was imagined from a Practice of this famous semale  Pict  because at Times she would lay on the Woad in such a Manner that Mr  Pope  's Line in his Translation of  Homer  may justly be applied to it  Her Beauty seems and only seems to shade  Upon the Whole  Cassibelana  was Leader of all the Fashions even in  Kent  the Inhabitants of which were the most polished of all our Islanders and as  Caesar  tells us differed but little from the Manners of the  Gauls  in like manner as our modern fine Ladies boast at present an exact Conformity to  French  Manners  From the foregoing Account which I have rendered as close as possible from the Manuscript now in my Possession it appears that even in the Days of the purest Simplicity Painting was the universal Practice and therefore strongly am I inclined to think it laudable in the amiable Sex at present I am further pleased to see the Fashions of the Ladies tending more rapidly every Day to a greater Similitude to the Customs of our Ancestors for it is very manifest that they are every Day becoming more and more naked and it is observable that they who display most of their lovely Bodies make the greatest Use of Paint which in my Opinion is not used from a Motive of female Vanity but as a modest and decent Covering to the Skin I must by the Way take notice that there is one Circumstance in which the modern Practice of Painting differs from antient Simplicity I do not find in the  Account of any Historian that the female  British Picts  applied the least Tincture of the Woad to the natural Complexion of their Faces For a Bloom and a Vivacity of Colour they trusted to Exercise fresh Air and wholesome Diet But as the fashionable Vigils of Gaming were unknown in those Days it must be allowed that this is an Improvement upon the Fashions of our Progenitors and indeed it could not be expected that in those rude Times so elegant a Diversion could be known For this we are indebted to modern Refinement which has introduced Improvements in Manners as well as in Arts and Sciences  For my Part I expect to see the Time when the Ladies will be to all Intents and Purposes as naked as our Ancestors and in my Apprehension if Things proceed with equal Celerity the Period is not very distant as their Cloaths are amazingly reduced at both Ends within these few Years We shall not then complain that the Importation of  French  Hoops and  French  Fashions of all Sorts are a Detriment to the Nation Mercers and Milliners will be useless Things and the Ladies will spend the Hours of the Toilet in Drawing and Painting by which Means I flatter myself that the  British  Fair will be able to boast their  Guidos  their  Titians  and their  Raphaels  To this End an ingenious Gentleman of my Acquaintance is now drawing up a System of Directions to a female Painter which will serve to aid their Invention and give them a proper Notion of Design and Colouring in all their Faces by which Means it is to be hoped they will greatly excel all the boasted Masters in every School of Painting  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Court of Censorial Enquiry  Aug    AN Information being

forth that the Liberty of walking in the Park has been allowed Time out of Mind unto all the good People of this Metropolis and that to hinder any one from the said Privilege is an Infringement of the

of our Club Mr  Plastic  the  Shaftsburian  Philosopher and Chairman for the Time being desired he might furnish the Essay of this Day  _A Taste for the imitative Arts is the highest Embellishment and ultimate Finishing of an accomplished Mind it gives an Elegance to a Man's Way of thinking throws a Polish on his Manners and by insensible Degrees refines the Passions and Affections of the Soul It may be added that a fine Taste is the Inlet of some of the  most delicate Pleasures human Life is susceptible of and may therefore properly be called in the Language of  Shaftsourian  Philosopy  the internal Sense  as by Means of this Faculty we are acquainted with many elegant Sensations to which the Generality of Men seem to be entirely Strangers This Talent is not unlike the Power of seeing just conferred on one whose Eye never could distinguish Colours it opens new Traces of thinking awakens pleasing Ideas and diffuses a Complacence through the whole intellectual Frame  There is nothing more common than to see Men who perceiving the Advantages which this elegant Turn gives to a chosen Few and observing that Quickness of Sensibility for which they are remarkable affect upon all Occasions to be endowed with the same nice Faculty of Perception but the Misfortune is they are absolutely callous to each fine Impression and the Method they chuse to convince us of their Delicacy is by pretending that nothing is refined enough for them Thus while others distinguish themselves by yielding to the Impulse of a Passion artfully excited by a Strain of Music a Poem or a Picture these Gentlemen would recommend themselves upon the Strength of their having never been pleased at any Rate This Procedure is for the most part to be observed in modern  Critics  or the  Malevoli  A Piece where every Beauty of Language and Sentiment is united where in the striking Passages every Line is impassioned and swells with the Emotion of the Soul like Glass in a Furnace informed by the Breath infused into it laid before one of this Class shall be received with cold Disdain and a Composition of  Arne  's full of all the Sweetness of musical Expression shall to their finer Organs sound like the most jarring Dissonance If a Man in a Club of Gentlemen should be perpetually displeased with every Thing while the rest of the Members perceive no  Cause of Complaint I apprehend there would be a strong Presumption that his Mouth was at those Seasons greatly out of Taste and with equal Propriety whoever boasts an Overrefinement of Understanding should be set down without Hesitation as one whose mental Organs are distempered As Matters are frequently managed a fine Taste instead of being a Power of receiving elegant Sensations would prove an Avenue for Uneasiness Discontent and a constant Dislike of every Thing around us and it would fare with this exquisite Degree of intellectual Feeling as with him whose external Senses are framed to receive acuter Impressions than our Employments in Life will admit  Say what the Use were finer Optics giv'n  T' inspect a Mite not comprehend the Heav'n  Or Touch if tremblingly alive all o'er  To smart and agonize at ev'ry Pore  Or quick Effluvia darting thro' the Brain  Die of a Rose in aromatic Pain  POPE  But Nature has not cast us in so delicate a Mould Both our bodily and mental Powers are fitted to administer to our Enjoyments and are by no means contrived to be the Cause of Fretfulness and a petulant Peevishness which serve only to sour the Temper and become troublesome and disagreeable in Society  To define a true Taste may be unnecessary at present as it has been often done by abler Pens but I believe it will be judged pertinent to the Subject in Hand to give the Reader some Description of it Mr  Locke  observes that many abstract Ideas are expressed by Terms taken from the Perceptions of our external Senses such as to  imagine comprehend conceive adhere  c which are  all applied to Modes of thinking In like Manner the Term now in Question is derived from the Sensation of our Palate which we call Taste and on account of some Similitude in the Operation i applied to the intellectual Faculty by Men of Imagination in all Languages the Information given to the Mind being in both Cases rapid and instantaneous without waiting for the more cool and deliberate Sentence of Reflection  Hence naturally arises a Distinction between Taste and Judgment which are often used as synonymous Expressions but are notwithstanding very different in themselves I believe many of my Readers know People among their Acquaintance who if you lay a Picture before them upon mature Deliberation and after comparing leisurely the Copy with their own Ideas of Nature can pronounce the Piece to be like without manifesting any particular Relish or Pleasure which is always a concomitant Circumstance with the Man of Taste It is he that enters into the Spirit and Stile of an Author sees in an Instant how he selects the Circumstances in a Description enjoys the Turn of his Expression and his Art in seizing the Passions and it is upon a Review of what thus strikes the Mind that the Critics of all Ages have been able to lay down Rules for Taste as Theories of Vision are framed from an Examination of the Organs of Sight and the Manner in which external Objects operate upon them and hence the  French  Wits have told us that nothing can be elegant which is not true upon an Observation that the Mind turns with Distaste from any Thing which contradicts its own Ideas  It is recorded of  Marcus Antoninus  that he acknowledged it to the Gods as a peculiar Felicity that he had not cultivated his Taste for Works of Imagination for fear they might have detained him from Objects of higher Importance but for my Part I cannot help wondering that he did not rather thank Heaven for the  elegant Turn bestowed upon him as it is certain that under due Regulation a just Taste is a constant Source of the most refined Gratifications  With this Talent a Man may retire into his Closet and there enjoy a more delicious Repast and better Company than can be met with in any modern Assembly  Homer  never denies himself to any Acquaintance and  Virgil  is always easy of Access whether you delight in sublime Description or the softer Beauties of rural Imagery A Man may take as much Liberty with  Horace  as his intruding Friend did in the  Via Sacra  free from the same Imputation of Impertinence and without the Expence of a  Remise  you may visit  Boileau La Fontaine Vollaire  and the politest of the  French  Nation

with  Bolingbroke  into the Cabinet there find him disclosing the secret Springs of Policy or receive a Clue from him to guide you through the Maze of History In short to a Mind well harmonized all Nature wears a pleasing Aspect and the Transition is easy from a Relish for external Beauty and the Pleasures arising from Poetry Eloquence and the Arts of Imitation to a Love for moral Perfection and the Dignity of Character  This is the Sentiment of  Cicero  in the Words of my Motto and it is enforced by the Author of  The Pleasures of Imagination  in such an exquisite Strain of Poetry that I must beg Leave to conclude with transcribing the Passage Speaking of a Man of Taste he has the following Lines  Not a Breeze  Flies o'er the Meadow not a Cloud imbibes  The setting Sun's Effulgence

Numbers of our Countrymen are busied in Enquiries after Mr  Keene  's Negotiations at the Court of  Madrid  to prevent the Depredations of the  Spaniards  upon  English  Merchantmen while some are interested in the Election a of King of the  Romans  and others employed in a Discussion of the Naturalization Act this Gentleman is entirely abstracted in his Speculations and concerns himself in

replied  There is something in Agitation Sir in both Kingdoms but it has not as yet transpired though I have a secret Channel for Intelligence and I believe I am pretty well in the Secret both Cabinets endeavour to suppress their Intentions but my Information comes from the Board of Green Cloth  At this Expression my Friend perceived me somewhat surprized and he therefore thought proper to explain himself  The Board of GreenCloth Sir  says he  is a metaphorical Term I generally make use of to signify what is vulgarly call the  Green Room  perhaps you never saw the  GreenRoom  it is the Place where the Performers rendezvous during the Play and for some Time after it that of  CoventGarden  is in the Form of an Oblong and I'll give you a particular Description of it  Here I was reduced to a Necessity of mentioning that it would be supersluous to give himself so much Trouble as that Place was as well known to me as the CoffeeRoom we were in which Hint I judged not improper as I knew that a violent Propensity to Description was one of my Friend's Singularities and that he is never so compleatly happy as when an Opportunity offers for him to display his florid Talents for this Embellishment of Conversation Upon these Occasions I have frequently observed his Eye sparkle with a peculiar Brillancy which never fails to be extinguished whenever he is checked in his Career as was the Case with him at present After looking serious for some Time he reassumed his Discourse  The Theatrical World Sir is nothing now to what it was formerly the People are infatuated with  Garrick  He has introduced a new Taste entirely I could wish I had lived in the Days when  Lun  was in his meridian Splendor Sir I have been delighted at a Recital of the many Feats he used to perform Don't you think it must have given the quickest Sensations of Surprize to an Audience to see him in the Character of  Harlequin  making his Escape into the Tub the Tub Sir is the Box over the Stage Door and when he was closely pursued by his Enemies it must have been delightful to perceive him dart as quick as an Arrow to its destined Mark or with the Celerity of a Bird in the Air from the Place where the whole House imagined him destitute of the Means of an Escape into the opposite Box and there stand laughing at his Pursuers There was always such an Exertion in his nervous System that I don't know whether you ever saw an Anatomy but I can lend you an Author upon the Animal Oeconomy from whom it will appear manifestly upon the clearest Principles how this was performed It would astonish you to hear the several Accidents he met with when he was locked in Arm over Arm with another at the Top of a Scene they both fell down clasped in each other's Embrace and how do you think he escapedwith an amazing Agility he turned his Fellowperformer under him so that he came down quite easy while the other broke his CollarbonePerhaps you never would be able to guess how many Steps he made in

of his Beams as  Milton  has it the rigid Frost will be impervious to his Rays and you will see the Lightning play upon the impassive Ice There will also be exhibited at a Distance a lofty Mountain from whose Summit will come roaring down a tumultuous Cataract loud and impetuous in its Course and at the Bottom will be placed a Reservoir to collect the rushing Torrent where it will form itself into a smooth expansive River which is to glide off in the Sight of the Spectators There will also be situated on the Banks of the River a Man with a FishingRod intent upon catching the Tenants of the

terroribus implet  HOR  _IT was a very particular Pleasure to me to learn the other Morning from my Friend  Wildair  that the Season for Theatrical Diversion is to commence this Evening From this Information I was insensibly led into some Reflexions upon the Profession of Playing which has been in most Ages held in a lower Degree of Estimation than any other Occupation in Life How this should have obtained in a Point which Reason does not suggest is somewhat surprizing though it may not be Matter of extreme Difficulty to trace the Error to its Source  The Players if I mistake not made their first Appearance in the World after the same Manner in which the most abandoned and wretched of our Days make their Exit that is to say in a Cart In this Vehicle they strolled about from Place to Place under the Direction of  Thespis  who was their Manager they had their Faces all bedaubed with Lees of Wine which no doubt contributed not a little with other contingent Circumstances to render them ridiculous And indeed in this Situation of the Drama it is no Wonder that they were looked upon as a Set of Low Fellows By insensible Degrees Matters were improved to greater Elegance though the old Opprobrium still continued to adhere to the Performers and perhaps their own Way of Life their own Morals their own Behaviour and the Appearance they every where made deserved that the first Impression should not be effaced By the  same Means the Prejudice has been derived down from Age to Age and till within these few Years passed the Laws which public Opinion had established continued in full Force till at Length they were repealed in Favour of the Few whose Life and Conversation should deserve it Mr  Pope  talking of  Shakespear  's Time observes  that as the best Playhouses were then Inns and Taverns the  Globe  the  Hope  the  Red Bull  the  Fortune  c so the Top of the Profession were then meer Players not Gentlemen of the Stage They were led into the Buttery by the Steward not placed at the Lord's Table or Lady's Toilet and consequently were entirely deprived of those Advantages they now enjoy in the familiar Conversation of our Nobility and an Intimacy not to say Dearness with People of the first Condition  Certain it is the Sentiments of Mankind have been very much changed in this Respect of late Years and indeed in all Ages and among all Men of Sense the Prejudice never had much Weight whenever there appeared one abstracted from the common Herd who besides the other Qualities requisite in his Business was possessed of a good Understanding adorned and embellished with Modesty Decency and good Manners Thus we find among the  Romans Roscius  the Player was held in general Esteem by all Men of Taste and Refinement  Cicero  loved him living and at his Decease paid an immortal Tribute to his Memory He omitted no Opportunity of celebrating his Name and in one of his most famous Orations  Who is there says he among us of so rude and unfeeling a Disposition as not to have been very sensibly affected at the Death of  Roscius  who though he died in an extreme old Age on Account of his excellent Art and his every Elegance deserved to be exempt from that Debt of human Nature" "  Quis nostrum tam animo agresti ac  duro fuit ut Roscii morte nuper non commoveretur Qui cum esset senex mortuus tamen propter excellentem artem ac venustatem videbatur omninò mori non debuisse  Mr  Betterton  was also the Friend the Companion the Favourite of a Set of Men who were the chief Honour to our Country  Dryden Pope Rowe Addison Congreve Steel  and the famous Doctor  Radcliffe  were the Personages that received him with open Arms and if Mr  Garrick  should never be able to boast such an exalted Acquaintance it is for this only Reason because it is hardly to be expected that such a Set of Men will again appear together  A compleat Actor appears so seldom in the World that I do not wonder whenever a  real Prometheus  with true Fire starts up among us at the Tribute of Admiration and Applause which is paid to him by the general Consent and so many Requisites are necessary to form one who can thus extort the public Approbation that I own I should not be surprized if this Art rose much higher in the Eyes of the Judicious There are many external Accomplishments which in other Professions may be dispensed with but the fine Performer must have a well formed Person a graceful Deportment a well turned Face a just Disposition of Features and an Eye expressive of the various subtile Movements of the Mind he must have improved the Air of his whole Person by an Habitude and Intercourse with Gentlemen and he must add to all this a Voice not only to articulate each Syllable distinctly and with Precision but also to deliver each Sentence with Grace and Harmony  Besides these external Qualifications what a Train of mental Endowments is absolutely necessary A good Understanding cultivated by a liberal Education a true Taste and Relish for all the Beauties in an Author a just Sense of every Passage and the Idea appropriated to each Word a thorough Knowledge of Character  an Imagination warm and alive to each fine Stroke of the  oet a Sensibility of Temper properly susceptible of each Passion the Writer addresses himself to and a Power of exciting that Passion in others What and how great that Power is the following Passage in  Hamlet  will better convey to the Reader than any Thing I have to offer on the Subject  Is it not monstrous that this Player here but in a Fiction in a Dream of Passion should so force his Soul to his own Conceit that from her working all his Visage wanned Tears in his Eyes Distraction in his Aspect a broken Voice and a Function suiting with Forms to his Conceit  From this Account I apprehend it must appear that this Profession should be reckoned among the liberal and imitative Arts and at the same Time I must observe that it cannot be thought too slightly of in those who repeat the mere Words in a vacant unfeeling Manner or whose Art consists in a wry Mouth or a Burn on the Jaw But when every Look Gesture and Action is governed by the Soul when the Imagination is wrapped and the Audience catch it by Contagion when the Artist imparts new Motions to our Spirits wrings the Soul with fancied Grief and fills us with imaginary Terrors then we perceive a Genius which cannot be too much admired I have often lamented that the Poverty of our Language does not afford a Term sufficiently expressive to distinguish such a Performer from the rest of his Fraternity as I always study to avoid Confusion in my Ideas I endeavour to seperate them in my own Mind by Words which appear to me to be best appropriated to them and till a better Distinction is pointed out I would chuse to call a Person such as I have described an Imitator or an Actor and he who pretends to the Art without any Knowledge of Nature should be set down a  mere Player  In this Sense Mr  Barry  will always be accounted a fine Actor and Mrs  Cibber  an Actress of irresistible skill It would not be perhaps unentertaining to examine the List of  Dramatis Personae  belonging to each Playhouse and when we should not find the  Actor  alone it might be diverting to see how both are blended and to enquire which is prevalent but the Reader if he approve the Hint may pursue it in his own Imagination

VIRG  _I HAVE been ever highly delighted with the Passage which I have this Day selected from  Virgil  for a Motto to my Paper They are the Words of  Evander  when he is receiving the pious  Trojan  Prince under his humble but hospitable Roof If I remember right Mr  Dryden  was an Admirer of the beautiful Simplicity of this Address As I have his Volumes at Hand I shall here transcribe the Passage  Honour our annual Feast and take your Seat  With friendly Welcome at a homely Treat  This Sentiment however short the Translation may be is highly admirable in the Original and should be impressed in very lively and deep Characters on every Man's Heart who is desirous of sharing the social Pleasures of Life  Content is most certainly the surest Source of an internal Happiness it not only reconciles a Person to  himself but also to those with whom he converses To use  Shakespear  's Phrase it is the chief Nourisher in Life's Feast and when giddy Mirth and Noise have subsided this keeps on an equal Tenor and if it never rises very high it has at least this Advantage that it does not ebb so low as to leave Shoals and Rocks discovered Mirth may properly be called an  Aurora Borealis  whereas Good Humour like a fixed Star sheds a constant Stream of Light which if it does not dazzle has at least at all Times a chearing Influence  If good Humour has this Advantage annexed to it Discontent must certainly be attended with many poignant Inconveniences In the same Proportion that Ease endears and enlivens our Days its Reverse must bring on each Morn in a Turbulence of Clouds the Spirits are perpetually sinking and all the Uses of this World as the Poet has it seem to him weary stale flat and unprofitable The Infection is always rankling in his Breast and he lives in an unceasing State of Hostility with himself and his Neighbours This by Degrees grows into a fixed Habit and then a lowering invariable Gloom hangs over his Mind and as he does not feel any Peace in his own inward Frame he is not tender about the Uneasiness he may create in another's Breast He therefere gives an unlimited Vent to his Sullenness and is ever finding fault with every Thing around him  There is one Circumstance which has a Kind of Tendency to alleviate this Perversity of Disposition and that is that the Propensity to Satyr which this Sullenness gives the Mind is often the Occasion of starting new and uncommon Remarks We sometimes hear from these Kind of Humourists Strokes of a peevish Pleasantry which are not unentertaining and as these People are ever fond of exhibiting a  Caricature  of their Acquaintances we now and then receive some Sketches or Pictures in Miniature in which the Colouring and the Drapery are so whimsisically  imagined that we really derive no small Degree of Diversion from their extravagant Turn But notwithstanding this Degree of Mirth which they involuntarily excite it does not sufficiently compensate for the Trouble they give for the most part A Man who can find no Relish in any Thing should be banished from Society he should be sent to an Infirmary of  Valetudinarians  and there be confined until he purges away his ill Humours or until Reason dispels the Mist which has obscured his Intellects  The sure  way of pleasing in Company is for a Man to be pleased inwardly and he that is not so should retire and brood over his Uneasiness and not become troublesome or invade the Harmony of Society I cannot help considering this fixed and permanent ill Humour as a Kind of  BlackJaundice  through the dark Medium of which every Thing that passes takes a Tincture I know a Person at present who has been in a  BlackJaundice  for many Years and he is still suffered by his Friends to go about finding Fault perpetually dissatisfied discontented and grumbling  Sullen  is his Name and he is known by his Acquaintance to be one of the greatest MalContents in the Creation  As soon as Mr  Sullen  wakes in a Morning if he has had a good Night's Repose  Damn it he cries what made me oversleep myself  He then rings his Bell the Servant has not Wings and of course does not fly to him Mr  Sullen  is then tempted to throw something at the Scoundrel's Head The next Thing the Servant is ordered to do he performs with the utmost Alacrity  Sirrah Rascal cries  Sullen  are you madMay be you're drunk this Morning alreadyCan't you do

TurtleFeast The Turtle was of a very great Size and accounted extremely fine by the Connoisseurs in this Sort of Eating it was dressed at the Owner's CountryHouse by the most skilful Cook in  London

a Cloud around her favourite Son in order to secure him from every human Eye and protect him from the Inconveniences to which he might be liable if seen by the Inhabitants This parental Care proved very useful to the Hero and we find something like it is practised by  Mother Dulness  who never fails to manifest a tender concern for her chosen Sons and accordingly they are often enveloped in a Cloud of Obscurity which no Ray of Light can pierce and thereby they are enabled to proceed in their Works of Darkness without Lett or Molestation But though there is this Similitude in the Fate of

Temper  Appius  is aukward in his Person and disagreeable in his Aspect his Mind is ever on the fret and if engaged in a CountryDance he is dissatisfied with every Thing around him and is eternally quarrelling with the Music With these disagreeable Features of Body and Mind  Appius  applied to  Musidora  to be his Partner for the Evening which she declined with great Affability and good Manners having before experienced the Inconvenience of the Foibles which have taken Root in this Gentleman's Temper  Appius  immediately took fire at the imagined Affront and full of Indignation retired home

The Composition was declared very pretty by all the Prudes and Coquettes of the Place both Species  of Women being Enemies to  Musidora  as she preserved a discreet Medium between a giddy Freedom on the one Hand and the reserve of Hypocrisy on the other The  Verses  were in a little Time in every body's Hand and  Appius  was declared to have a very fine Turn for Poetry The Effect which this

uneasy Passions to prevent any further Vexation her Relations were obliged in a Week's Time to fly from a Place where Innocence and Honour are sacrificed to a Jest where the Men take a wanton Pleasure in Scandal and where the Fair join in Combination against Truth and Virtue  How People can thus become avowed Enemies to their own Happiness and so universally adopt a Custom which certainly would be more honoured in the Breach than the Observance is to me highly unaccountable It reminds me of the Licentiousness used by the Chorus in the Infancy of the Drama when Malice was substituted in the room

Subjects  has been put abroad into the World by several eminent Writers and in  France  to this Day it continues to be a favourite Manner of conveying an Author's Sentiments to the Public The famous  Rochfoucault  succeeded so well upon this Plan that he is universally admired wherever Wit and Poignancy of Matter are relished This Scheme of Writing indulges a free roving Exercise of the Mind as Lord  Shaftsbury  expresses it it sets us free from the Fatigue of pursuing a long and regular Tract of wellconcerted Reasoning and may from its appearing in loose detached Sentences seem to the Reader to carry with it no great Difficulty in the Execution but it is nevertheless as hard as any other Vehicle of Instruction as it raises a Demand for close Sense and a lively Turn  of Expression in almost every Line Hence it is that the Writer already mentioned has been so much celebrated by People of Taste and hence it is that  Pope  and  Swift  have thought proper to follow him in this Path of  Satyr  A very ingenious  French  Writer has also published within this short Time an entire Volume in this Way abounding in excellent Reflections upon all Occurrences in Life full of strong Sense and highly spirited in the Diction After having perused this Author my Mind acquired such a Habit of thinking in this unconnected Fashion that I could not settle my Thoughts on any one Topic for the Entertainment of my Readers Wherever I went whether through the Streets upon ordinary Business or into the Playhouse where at present as  Thompson  has it in his admirable Poem called  Winter  Dread o'er the Scene the Ghost of  Hamlet  stalks  Othello  rages poor  Monimia  mourns  And  Belvidera  pours her Soul in Love  I found myself constantly talking Sentences and I therefore resolved to commit them to Paper this Day  THOUGHTS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS  A Periodical Writer in order to procure himself a sufficient Number of Readers should endeavour to render his Works agreeable to the various Palates which predominate among the several Inhabitants of this Metropolis But though he should season his Papers to the Taste in vogue he should not entirely give up his own Judgment As  Cowley  has it The World may so come in a Man's Way that he may salute it but he should not go a whoring after it  The severest Critics upon Writing are those who know the least of it which is some Comfort to an Author who lives in an Age of Envy Malice IllNature and Detraction  Dean  Swift  tell us that when he was a young Man he believed that the Rest of the World resembled himself in talking of nothing but the last New Play In this particular  Ranger  is perhaps too much like that great Genius  When a Set of Booksellers are concerned in a NewsPaper a  Monthly Review  or a  Magazine  they take every Opportunity in the said Productions of praising the Works in which they have a Property themselves and of decrying every Thing that may prevent an Increase of their own Sale Writers who are illused by them in this Shape may enjoy always this Comfort that were these People to  poll  in  Parnassus  their Votes upon a  Scrutiny  would be struck off as they are only  Copyholders  You may know what a Gentleman thinks of you by the Behaviour of his Servants while they wait at Table These People are always such sincere Friends to their Master and have his Honour and Glory so much at Heart that they generally place their Affections and Resentments upon the same Object unless their Judgment is handsomely bribed at the Street Door  On the contrary you may know what the WaitingMaid thinks of you by the Reception you meet with from her Mistress for at present all young Ladies are directed in their Opinions concerning the Men by what Mrs  Betty  is pleased to say at the Toilet and

goes there is generally more  Art  to obtain Success than  Merit  to deserve it  Sounding Periods and pompous Expressions no more constitute a beautiful Stile than struting in  Red Heel  Shoes and  Gold Clock  Stockings can make a graceful Walk both may serve to impose upon the injudicious  but those who are acquainted with Men and Books will always think Ease a very requisite Quality  Discretion has its Bounds as well as all other Virtues and it degenerates into a Vice if like  Aaron  's Serpent it swallows up the rest  A MOTTO for the  JEWS  Nos alia ex aliis in Fata vocamur  When I reflect on the late  MarriageAct  I cannot help crying out with the Poet  Curse on all Laws but those which Love has made  It is boldly remarked by a very good  French  Writer that a King who does not keep a Mistress is highly estimable provided he does not become a Bigot through too much Devotion  Politicians have observed that  England  can never be undone but by a Parliament if that be true what are the Addresses from Candidates to their Electors but so many Petitions to let them have a Hand in  NaturalizationActs JewBills  Taxes and in short the RUIN of their COUNTRY  The surest Way of amassing overgrown Riches is by a due Government or rather Suppression of a Man's own Passions and artfully administering to the Gratification of other People's  It is much more difficult to HEAR in Company than to SPEAK Every one is willing to do the latter but few have Politeness enough to do the former though it serves a double Purpose it shews our Manners at the same Time that it improves the Understanding  The late Doctor  Swift  is not generally esteemed as a Man in this Point the World agrees with the  Dean  himself who was always mortified to think himself of  a Species  Of at the Arguments in Favour of Vice  defendit  is the worst who would chuse to travel in a  Road because it is crowded  Every Age has a peculiar Characteristic to distinguish it the last Century was remarkable for a comic Genius which sometimes run out into unwarrantable Luxuriancies and a Breach of Manners the present Times have acquired a politer Taste but cannot produce any Work of Theatrical Humour The former transgressed through an Excess of Vigour the latter are decent but they have that kind of Decency which arises from a Want of Power rather than of Will and should take for their

but to make the best of your own Hand  Some People's Discretion is the Reverse of Charity it covers a Multitude of Virtues as the latter does a Multitude of Sins  It was well said by a Gentleman at a

BrotherOfficers will hate him for being put over their Heads  Religion which should make us live in Peace and Charity is the Source of our most violent Animosities no one being willing to let his

Critic has given it for a Rule that every Author should from Time to Time  sacrifice to the Graces  thereby beautifully insinuating that Writers should endeavour to fashion their Minds into an elegant Way of Thinking which will be always sure to transpire into their Compositions and will be manifested by a delicate Choice of Sentiment and Expression  Inest facundis gratia dictis  is the Phrase by which an Author of Taste has signified a Polish and Refinement in a Performance and indeed among the Antients in general it is this peculiar Grace this genteel Manner of conceiving and expressing their Thoughts that has made their Productions the Admiration of Ages and those have been accounted classic Writers among the Moderns who have succeeded best in imitating the  Greek  and  Roman  Originals  Full of these Reflections I retired to Rest a few Nights since when in the Hours of Sleep my busy Imagination pursued the same Track of Contemplation and presented to me the following Scene I dreamt that an Order was issued out from the High Court of  Parnassus  requiring the immediate Attendance of all the Inhabitants of the Place at a SACRIFICE TO THE GRACES according to an anniversary Institution in Honour of the Day on which  Apollo  slew the  Python  For this Purpose the three lovely Sisters walked together interchanging in their Way mutual Glances of Cordiality and Affection  to an elegant Edifice raised by  Inigo Jones  each had in her Hand Mr  Hogarth  's  Analysis of Beauty  They placed themselves on an eminent Altar in such amiable Attitudes as have not been equalled on any of our Theatres since the Manager of  DruryLane  House withdrew a certain Lady from the publick Eye  As soon as the  Goddesses  were thus prepared for the Solemnity  Apollo  in all the Pride of manly Beauty advanced to the Altar and paid his Adoration This done the Muses came forward in Procession and after prostrating themselves in a respectful Manner they mixed together in a Dance and sung Hymns of Praise in Honour of the Graces  Ducunt choreas carmina dicunt  The whole poetic Region was exhilerated at the Sound and every Thing that before looked beautiful seemed to glow with additional Charms  This Part of the Ceremony being concluded a Trumpet sounded three Times as a Signal for Men of Genius to make their Approach and instantly a  Grecian  Band appeared The most remarkable among them were  Homer Socrates Plato Sophocles  and  Longinus Aristotle  having sent Word that he was engaged in a  Syllogism  and could not attend  Socrates  who we are told called Dancing a Sacrifice to the Graces immediately began a Movement before the Altar and  Plato  ey'd him with a stedfast Look  Longinus  having acquitted himself in the due Forms of Veneration fixed his Attention on  Homer  Lucretius  was Leader of the next Division he thanked the  Graces  for having scattered so many Flowers amidst the Thorns which shoot up in his Part of  Parnassus Terence  who was always an  elegant Observer of Forms  seemed to receive great Delight from beholding so much Beauty and he preferred his Prayer with the utmost Purity of Diction  The Posture in which  Tully  placed himself recalled  to my Mind the Description of him in the  Temple of Fame  Gath'ring his flowing Robe he seem'd to stand  In Act to speak and graceful wav'd his Hand  He declared in a flowing Stile that  from an Habit of surveying the Beauty of external Objects the Mind makes an easy Transition to the Fitness the Order and Regularity of its own inward Frame and from a View of outward Decorum it begins to acquire the same Correctness and Elegance in its own Operations studiously careful not to think or do any Thing unhandsomely from whence results that  Grace of Character  which is in its very Nature highly eligible and Praise worthy  Virgil  came forward with a modest Mien and great Regularity in his Motion He desired to pass all his Time with the  Graces  and the  Muses  and bowing respectfully thanked the  Graces  for that elegant Simplicity the  Molle atque facetum  which they had conferred upon him He then retired to a laureat Shade where he almost hid himself in illustrious Ease  Statius Lucan  and  Silius Italicus  endeavoured to walk in the same Path after him and sometimes they even aimed at his Footsteps but an aukward Strut in their Gate rendered it impracticable The Goddesses told  Ovid  that they were sorry they could not follow him into Exile At the Approach of  Horace Venus  and all the laughing Loves smiled with peculiar Pleasure  Tibullus  was received with every Token of Affection and before he withdrew he begged Leave to introduce Mr  Hammond  to their Presence which was granted and accordingly Mr  Hammond  had the Honour of kissing their Hands  After this a Pause ensued in the Rites occasioned by the Delay of several  Monks  and  Fathers  to whom a Summon had been sent commanding their Attendance  They were all in a Cluster at the Foot of  Parnassus  and they at length returned for answer that they did not chuse to worship false Deities After such a Declaration it was with Surprize I beheld a certain  Bishop  lay aside his Mitre and venerate the Pagan Goddesses  Upon enquiring his Name I found this Personage to be the celebrated  Vida  He was followed by  Erasmus Strada Bohours  and several  Jesuits  who were at length joined by  Boileou  and  La Fontaine  The former had a Degree of Severity mixed in his Smiles and the latter was all Quickness Vivacity and Wit In Imitation of  Tibullus  they begged Leave to present their Friends and accordingly  Garth Prior  and  Gay  were introduced  Shakespear  and  Milton  came down from the highest Eminence in  Parnassus  to pay their Respects but while they were performing their Duty I observed they both raised their Heads to look at a Part of the Heavens where there was a distant Thunder  Dryden  had not Money to procure a sufficient Quantity of  Frankincense  but the Graces accepted the Intention for the Deed convinced by several Touches in his Works that no one had a finer Sense of Beauty Mr  Pope  advanced with his Eyes fixed upon  Homer  who was then in Company with  Virgil  his Look was thoughtful but bright and he delivered himself in the most harmonious Numbers  Addison  followed close at his Heels and he acquitted himself in his peculiar Manner of giving good Sense all the Embellishments of Ease and artful Negligence He observed how much Good Humour added to the Beauty of the  Graces  and he was pleased to see them without any fashionable Edifice of Hair on their Heads and free from any enormous Circle of the Hoop  By this Time a general Whisper began to run thro' all the Ranks owing as I soon perceived to the Appearance of Dr  Swift  who approached with  Cadenus  and  Vanessa  in his Hand as an Offering to the Graces As he drew nearer he  sucked in his Cheeks  and the Goddesses turned to each other with a Smile Upon his making an Apology for some Strokes in his Works they assured him that they could overlook those Singularities on Account of his other admirable Qualities and they added that what was formerly granted to  Virgil  should be also allowed to him  viz To toss about his Dung with an Air of Gracefulness  Lord  Shaftsbury  was ready to yield all Veneration to three Goddesses who had always warmed his Fancy with the brightest Ideas This noble Writer was succeeded by the Lord Viscount  Bolingbroke  who by the Way declared himself an Enemy to all Forms of Worship He avowed at the same Time that he was readier to pay Adoration to those bright Existences than to the  God  of  Moses  or the  God  of  Paul  on which Topics he harangued with a Roll of Periods in which tho' he did not advance the strict Truth he deserved at least to be called in the Words of a witty Satyrist a  polite Apostate from God's Grace to Wit  His Lordship withdrew and I then perceived some certain modern Periodical Writers entering the Temple They approached the Altar with a College Mien and a pompous Affectation of learned Industry Though no Charge could be brought against them for want of Matter their Stile appeared too elaborate and their Words frequently formed an  exotic Dialect of adventitious Phrases  by which Means all Ease was discarded from their Writings and where Ease is wanting Grace will be always deficient  Emboldened by the Example of my Brother Writers methought I approached the Altar but I was told by  Euphrosyne  that I advanced with rather too great an Air of Negligence and the Goddess advised me to avoid the Appearance of Thoughtlessness while I endeavoured to be easy and graceful I was so stung with  this Reproach that my Repose was instantly disturbed and when awakened I pleased myself in the Reflection that the whole was but a Dream  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  ON  Wednesday  last Miss  Grogram  of  Cheapside  had her Ears bored for the first Time to the great Joy of all her Family  Whereas a Report prevailed that  Crookfingered Jack  has left off Trade we can now assure his Friends that he only retired to lurk about the Door of  Vauxhall  Gardens during the SummerSeason and he

expectare calorem  Paulisperque operi posito subducere mentem  Mutati donec redeat clementia coeli  VIDA  _THE Author from whom I have selected the Motto of this Day's Paper was a Poet of great Elegance as well as a Critic of the most refined Taste He observes in his excellent  Art of Poetry  that the Genius of Writers is frequently very unequal their Vigour often exhausted and their Spirits sunk as if  Apollo  and the Muses had quite abandoned the tuneful Breast and therefore he advises every Author to call off his Mind at proper Seasons from the Studies he is employed in in order to wait more propitious Moments when the Return of the poetic Heat and the Influence of the God may render his Productions more animated  This Precept certainly should be adhered to by all who presume to lay their Lucubrations before the Public but it often happens that the periodical Essayist however inclined he may be to retouch and finish is compelled by Necessity to dismiss the uncorrected Sheet to the Press for though the Town may think they have a Right to an Author's whole Time and that he should grow pale at the Midnight Lamp the better to make a Part of their TeaEquipage in a Morning it cannot but often be the Case that Business of some Sort social Connections and sundry various Avocations  shall obtrude themselves so as to render it impossible for a Writer to comply with that Respect he owes his Readers for as it has been wittily said by Sir  Richard Steel  an Adventurer in this Way is like a Man who keeps a StageCoach he must set out whether there are Passengers or not  I have sometimes since the Commencement of the  Gray's Inn Journal  been curious after my own Fame and on this Account I have often seated myself in a snug Part of a Coffeehouse in Order to collect the Sentiments of the Public concerning the present Writer Upon these Occasions I have observed that no Allowance is made for a temporary Want of Health an accidental Depression of Spirits to which all Men are liable at Times and I must add that it is not common for Readers in Coffee houses to make any Abatement of their Severity on Account of the Humour they may be in themselves their own want of Ease and their usual Cheerfulness I remember to have been damned by a well looking Man because his Wine was bad the Night before and the Fumes of it were still in his Head an uxorious Gentleman who is sometimes a little Henpecked by his Wife is sure never to relish me after a CurtainLecture and the Price of Corn at  BearKey  has more than once lowered me in the Estimation of a solid Citizen Add to these accidental Contingencies the great Variety of Tasles which prevall in every Company and which it is a moral Impossibility for any Writer to gratify at once I have occasionally entertained the Town with Essays of Pleasantry and Humour and the Consequence is that it has raised a Demand upon me every  Saturday  for an equal Vein of Mirth Because the  Temple of Laverna  has excited a general Laugh it is asked upon entering a Coffeeroom  Waiter has Mr  Ranger  given us any more detached Scenes to Day" "Is there any Thing immensly high" "O this is against Suicide there  is no Fun here  says another and a third exclaims  Pshaw this Man is always laughingcan't he be serious a little and give us something that has Stuff in itEssays on Taste and Poets and Humourists and Monkeys and Stile Here Boy give me the  Gazetteer  or the  LondonDaily Advertiser  which ever is out of Hand  A Correspondent who writes to me from his House near  Litchfield  begs to know why I have entirely discarded Politics and has the following Paragraph  Why won't you have a Fling at the TimesA Touch now and then upon the Ministry and a Stricture upon the Constitution would have a pretty go down with us in the Country  As it is now considently afferted that the  JewBill  will be repealed I have resolved with myself to be a Tool to no Party whatever and as to the Care of our Constitution I heartily recommand it to those who are entrusted with it  "Videant Consules ucquid detrimenti Res Publica capiat"  This Paper was undertaken to contribute as far as the Author's Time and Abilities would permit him to the Entertainment or Instruction of his Readers to laugh out of Countenance many of those Foibles which are apt to shoot up in this Metropolis to amuse the Fair to promote Decency and good Manners and to detect Impostors in Writing Criticism and many Situations of Life That this has succeeded far beyond his warmest Hopes he is not backward to acknowledge he thinks himself obliged to his candid Readers for the savourable Reception they have hitherto been pleased to afford to the Production of his leisure Hours and though he is not inclinable to arrogate to himself any Vanity on this Head he is notwithstanding pleased in a particular Degree to find that this his first Attempt has gone on with growing Reputation from the first Out set to this present  Saturday  without anticipating  the public Favour by Pusss in the NewsPapers or by the Address of Emissaries who should considently assert that it was to be the joint Labour and Production of some of the best Writers of the Age without a Combination of Booksellers to support it by a Subscription and without the Patronage of any great Man whatever The Author always disdained such little Artisices well knowing that if he had any Wit to recommend him the Public would return a Degree of Encouragement in Proportion to their Entertainment and on this Account he has never been so industrious to insinuate that a very eminent Hand was engaged that Sir  Gecrge  ***** wrote such an Essay that my Lord ***** diverted the Choice Spirits such a Day that the last was very sine and came from the Honourable ***** that the Author of ***** contributed the exquisite Entertainment in such a Piece and that Mr ***** the Translator of ***** was certainly one of the Gentlemen concerned in it and that his Stile could be easily traced in the respective Pieces belonging to him  Without these Advantages the  Gray'sInn Journal  has found the Way to amuse the Town once a Week for twelve Months past and I may boast with perhaps sewer voluntary Supplies than is generally afforded to Authors on these OccasionsHowever as I am not inclined to assume to myself any  Praise  that my own Conviction does not tell me is properly mine I must here let the Public know that there is a Person to whom I am frequently obliged for all the Assistance he can contribute I shall not mention his Name as I am persuaded it would not be agreeable to one of his Modesty and delicate Sense of Things thus much I will hint that this Personage is no other than the Compositor of the Press who finding that my Occupations will not permit me to revise the Paper myself is kind enough upon several Occasions to alter Words and Sentences  according to his own Taste and whenever a Phrase does not entirely please him the Reader is sure to see something substituted in its room for Instance I had Occasion to mention some Time since  a Treaty of Marriage  which this Gentleman converted into a  Treatise of Marriage  and the Reader's own Observation will point out to him several Elegancies of this Nature upon other Occasions all which Embellishments of Stile I beg may be invariably attributed to the abovementioned Compositor of the Press of whom I shall say no more at present but as the Printer's Devil is now with me for this Lucubration I shall conclude with a Return of my sincere Thanks to the Public for the Encouragement they have afforded me during the Course of this Volume with a grateful Sense of which I here take my Leave and remain until next  Saturday  the candid Readers  Most obedient and very humble Servant CHARLES RANGER  TRUE INTELLIGENCE
