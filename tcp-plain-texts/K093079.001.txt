 A COLLECTION of POEMS  THE SECOND EDITION  VOL I  A COLLECTION OF POEMS IN FOUR VOLUMES  BY SEVERAL HANDS  LONDON Printed for G PEARCH N  o  CHEAPSIDE MDCCLXX  ADVERTISEMENT  IN an age like the present wherein literary merit of every kind so much abounds and is at the same time so much encouraged many poetical performances which deserve a longer remembrance than fugitive pieces usually meet with are daily thrown upon the public and left to perish in oblivion To select these from the trifling productions of the day has ever been considered as an useful employment and the favourable reception which Mr DODSLEY's elegant Collection of Poems obtained from the public is sufficient to encourage any person who has the means in his power to continue that deservedly esteemed Miscellany Several attempts of this sort have been made but none have acquired so much reputation as to render the present undertaking useless or unnecessary  Twelve years are now elapsed since the last volumes of that work were published in which time it is not to be supposed that there has been so great a dearth of genius but that many pieces have made their appearance which are not inferior to the best preserved in that Miscellany Of the truth of this observation the Editor appeals to the following Collection which is compiled from the best productions published within that time which Mr DODSLEY had not the opportunity of seeing with the addition of many other pieces which with all his diligence were overlooked by him With what degree of judgment this Collection is made the Editor submits to the determination of the public the greater part of the poetical pieces of the last thirty years have passed through his hands and as of them the following Volumes are composed he hopes they will not be considered as in improper Supplement to the work of which they are designed as a Continuation He flatters himself that he has not suffered private friendship to obtrude any piece into this Collection which is unworthy of the rest and great care has been  taken to prevent the insertion of any performance which has not been approved by gentlemen of distinguished reputation but as he is sensible that the taste of persons is very different he expects not after all that every piece will meet with equal applause being convinced of the truth of Mr DODSLEY's observation  "That it is impossible to furnish out an entertainment of this nature where every part shall be relished by every guest"  ARGUMENT  Abelard and Eloisa flourished in the twelfth century they were two of the most distinguished persons of their age in learning and beauty but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate passion After a long course of calamities they retired each to a several convent and consecrated the remainder of their days to religion It was many years after this separation that a letter of Abelard to a friend which contained the history of his misfortunes fell into the hands of Eloisa this occasioned those celebrated letters out of which the following is partly extracted which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature virtue and passion  Isaac Taylor del et sculp  ABELARD TO ELOISA  BY MR CAWTHORNE MASTER OF TUNBRIDGESCHOOL  AH why this boding start this sudden pain  That wings my pulse and shoots from vein to vein  What mean regardless of yon midnight bell  These earthborn visions saddening o'er my cell  What strange disorder prompts these thoughts to glow  These sighs to murmur and these tears to flow  'Tis she 'tis Eloisa's form restor'd  Once a pure saint and more than saints ador'd  She comes in all her killing charms confest  Glares thro' the gloom and pours upon my breast  Bids heav'n's bright guard from Paraclete remove  And drags me back to misery and love  Enjoy thy triumphs dear illusion see  This sad apostate from his God to thee  See at thy call my guilty warmths return  Flame thro' my blood and steal me from my urn  Yet yet frail Abelard one effort try  Ere the last lingering spark of virtue die  The deadly charming sorceress controul  And spite of nature tear her from thy soul  Long has that soul in these unsocial woods  Where anguish muses and where horror broods  From love's wild visionary wishes stray'd  And sought to lose thy beauties in the shade  Faith dropt a smile devotion lent her fire  Woke the keen pang and sanctify'd desire  Led me enraptur'd to the blest abode  And taught my heart to glow with all its God  But oh how weak fair faith and virtue prove  When Eloisa melts away in love  When her fond soul impassion'd rapt unveil'd  No joy forgotten and no wish conceal'd  Flows thro' her pen as infant softness free  And fiercely springs in ecstasies to me  Ye heavens as walking in yon sacred fane  With every seraph warm in every vein  Just as remorse had rous'd an aking sigh  And my torn soul hung trembling in my eye  In that kind hour thy fatal letter came  I saw I gaz'd I shiver'd at the name  The conscious lamps at once forgot to shine  Prophetic tremors shook the hallow'd shrine  Priests censors altars from thy genius fled  And heaven itself shut on me while I read  Dear smiling mischief art thou still the same  The still pale victim of too soft a flame  Warm as when first with more than mortal shine  Each melting eyeball mix'd thy soul with mine  Have not thy tears for ever taught to flow  The glooms of absence and the pangs of woe  The pomp of sacrifice the whisper'd tale  The dreadful vow yet hovering o'er thy veil  Drove this bewitching fondness from thy breast  Curb'd the loose wish and form'd each pulse to rest  And canst thou still still bend the suppliant knee  To love's dread shrine and weep and sigh for me  Then take me take me lock me in thy arms  Spring to my lips and give me all thy charms  No fly me fly me spread th' impatient sail  Steal the lark's wing and mount the swiftest gale  Skim the last ocean freeze beneath the pole  Renounce me curse me root me from thy soul  Fly fly for justice bares the arm of God  And the grasp'd vengeance only waits his nod  Are these my wishes can they thus aspire  Does phrenzy form them or does grace inspire  Can Abelard in hurricanes of zeal  Betray his heart and teach thee not to feel  Teach thy enamour'd spirit to disown  Each human warmth and chill thee into stone  Ah rather let my tenderest accents move  The last wild tumults of unholy love  On that dear bosom trembling let me lie  Pour out my soul and in fierce raptures die  Rouze all my passions act my joys anew  Farewell ye cells ye martyr'd saints adieu  Sleep conscience sleep each awful thought be drown'd  And sevenfold darkness veil the scene around  What means this pause this agonizing start  This glimpse of heaven quickrushing thro' my heart  Methinks I see a radiant cross display'd  A wounded Saviour bl eds along the shade  Around th' expiring God bright angels fly  Swell the loud hymn and open all the sky  O save me save me ere the thunders roll  And hell's black caverns swallow up my soul  Return ye hours when guiltless of a stain  My strongplum'd genius throbb'd in every vein  When warm'd with all th' Aegyptian fanes inspir'd  All Athens boasted and all Rome admir'd  My merit in its full meridian shone  Each rival blushing and each heart my own  Return ye scenes ah no from fancy fly  On time's stretch'd wing till each idea die  Eternal fly since all that learning gave  Too weak to conquer and too fond to save  To love's soft empire every wish betray'd  And left my laurels withering in the shade  Let me forget that while deceitful fame  Grasp'd her shrill trump and fill'd it with my name  Thy stronger charms impower'd by heav'n to move  Each saint each blest insensible to love  At once my soul from bright ambition won  I hugg'd the dart I wish'd to be undone  No more pale science durst my thoughts engage  Insipid dulness hung on every page  The midnight lamp no more enjoy'd its blaze  No more my spirit flew from maze to maze  Thy glances bade philosophy resign  Her throne to thee and every sense was thine  But what could all the frosts of wisdom do  Oppos'd to beauty when it melts in you  Since these dark cheerless solitary caves  Deathbreathing woods and dailyopening graves  Misshapen rocks wild images of woe  For ever howling to the deeps below  Ungenial desarts where no vernal shower  Wakes the green herb or paints th' unfolding flower  Th' imbrowning glooms these holy mansions shed  The nightborn horrors brooding o'er my bed  The dismal scenes black melancholy pours  O'er the sad visions of enanguish'd hours  Lean abstinence wan grief lowthoughted care  Distracting guilt and hell's worst fiend despair  Conspire in vain with all the aids of art  To blot thy dear idea from my heart  Delusive sightless god of warm desire  Why would'st thou wish to set a wretch on fire  Why lives thy soft divinity where woe  Heaves the pale sigh and anguish loves to glow  Fly to the mead the daisypainted vale  Breathe in its sweets and melt along the gale  Fly where gay scenes luxurious youths employ  Where every moment steals the wing of joy  There may'st thou see low prostrate at thy throne  Devoted slaves and victims all thy own  Each villageswain the turfbuilt shrine shall raise  And kings command whole hecatombs to blaze  O memory ingenious to revive  Each fleeting hour and teach the past to live  Witness what conflicts this frail bosom tore  What griefs I suffer'd and what pangs I bore  How long I struggled labour'd strove to save  An heart that panted to be still a slave  When youth warmth rapture spirit love and flame  Seiz'd every sense and burnt thro' all my frame  From youth warmth rapture to these wilds I fled  My food the herbage and the rock my bed  There while these venerable cloisters rise  O'er the bleak surge and gain upon the skies  My wounded soul indulg'd the tear to flow  O'er all her sad vicissitudes of woe  Profuse of life and yet afraid to die  Guilt in my heart and horror in my eye  With ceaseless prayers the whole artillery given  To win the mercies of offended heaven  Each hill made vocal eccho'd all around  While my torn breast knock'd bleeding on the ground  Yet yet alas tho' all my moments fly  Stain'd by a tear and darken'd in a sigh  Tho' meagre fasts have on my cheek display'd  The dusk of death and sunk me to a shade  Spite of myself the stillimpoisoning dart  Shoots thro' my blood and drinks up all my heart  My vows and wishes wildly disagree  And grace itself mistakes my God for thee  Athwart the glooms that wrap the midnight sky  My Eloisa steals upon my eye  For ever rises in the solar ray  A phantom brighter than the blaze of day  Wheree'er I go the visionary guest  Pants on my lip or sinks upon my breast  Unfolds her sweets and throbbing to destroy  Winds round my heart in luxury of joy  While loud hosannas shake the shrines around  I hear her softer accents in the sound  Her idolbeauties on each altar glare  And heaven muchinjur'd has but half my prayer  No tears can drive her hence no pangs controul  For every object brings her to my soul  Last night reclining on yon airy steep  My busy eyes hung brooding o'er the deep  The breathless whirlwinds slept in every cave  And the soft moonbeam danc'd from wave to wave  Each former bliss in this bright mirror seen  With all my glories dawn'd upon the scene  Recall'd the dear auspicious hour anew  When my fond soul to Eloisa flew  When with keen speechless ecstasies opprest  Thy frantic lover snatch'd thee to his breast  Gaz'd on thy blushes arm'd with every grace  And saw the goddess beaming in thy face  Saw thy wild trembling ardent wishes move  Each pulse to rapture and each glance to love  But lo the winds descend the billows roar  Foam to the clouds and burst upon the shore  Vast peals of thunder o'er the ocean roll  The flamewing'd lightning gleams from pole to pole  At once the pleasing images withdrew  And more than horrors crouded on my view  Thy uncle's form in all his ire array'd  Serenely dreadful stalk'd along the shade  Pierc'd by his sword I sunk upon the ground  The spectre ghastly smil'd upon the wound  A group of black infernals round me hung  And toss'd my infamy from tongue to tongue  Detested wretch how impotent thy age  How weak'thy malice and how kind thy rage  Spite of thyself inhuman as thou art  Thy murdering hand has left me all my heart  Left me each tender fond affection warm  A nerve to tremble and an eye to charm  No cruel cruel exquisite in ill  Thou thought'st it dull barbarity to kill  My death had robb'd lost vengeance of her toil  And scarcely warm'd a Scythian to a smile  Sublimer furies taught thy soul to glow  With all their savage mysteries of woe  Taught thy unfeeling poniard to destroy  The powers of nature and the source of joy  To stretch me on the racks of vain desire  Each passion throbbing and each wish on fire  Mad to enjoy unable to be blest  Fiends in my veins and hell within my breast  Aid me fair faith assist me grace divine  Ye martyrs bless me and ye saints refine  Ye sacred groves ye heavendevoted walls  Where folly sickens and where virtue calls  Ye vows ye altars from this bosom tear  Voluptuous love and leave no anguish there  Oblivion be thy blackest plume display'd  O'er all my griefs and hide me in the shade  And thou too fondly idoliz'd attend  While awful reason whispers in the friend  Friend did I say immortals what a name  Can dull cold friendship own so wild a flame  No let thy lover whose enkindling eye  Shot all his soul between thee and the sky  Whose warmths bewitch'd thee whose unhallow'd song  Call'd thy rapt ear to die upon his tongue  Now strongly rouze while heaven his zeal inspires  Diviner transports and more holy fires  Calm all thy passions all thy peace restore  And teach that snowy breast to heave no more  Torn from the world within dark cells immur'd  By angels guarded and by vows secur'd  To all that once awoke thy fondness dead  And hope pale sorrow's last sad refuge fled  Why wilt thou weep and sigh and melt in vain  Brood o'er false joys and hug th'ideal chain  Say canst thou wish that madly wild to fly  From yon bright portal opening in the sky  Thy Abelard should bid his God adieu  Pant at thy feet and taste thy charms anew  Ye heavens if to this tender bosom woo'd  Thy mere idea harrows up my blood  If one faint glimpse of Eloise can move  The fiercest wildest agonies of love  What shall I be when dazzling as the light  Thy whole effulgence flows upon my sight  Look on thyself consider who thou art  And learn to be an abbess in thy heart  See while devotion's evermelting strain  Pours the loud organ thro' the trembling fane  Yon pious maids each earthly wish disown  Kiss the dread cross and croud upon the throne  O let thy soul the sacred charge attend  Their warmths inspirit and their virtues mend  Teach every breast from every hymn to steal  The seraph's meekness and the seraph's zeal  To rise to rapture to dissolve away  In dreams of heaven and lead thyself the way  Till all the glories of the blest abode  Blaze on the scene and every thought is God  While thus thy exemplary cares prevail  And make each vestal spotless as her veil  Th' eternal spirit o'er thy cell shall move  In the soft image of the mystic dove  The longlost gleams of heavenly comfort bring  Peace in his smile and healing on his wing  At once remove affliction from thy breast  Melt o'er thy soul and hush her pangs to rest  O that my soul from love's curst bondage free  Could catch the transports that I urge to thee  O that some angel's more than magic art  Would kindly tear the hermit from his heart  Extinguish every guilty sense and leave  No pulse to riot and no sigh to heave  Vain fruitless wish still still the vigorous flame  Bursts like an earthquake thro' my shatter'd frame  Spite of the joys that truth and virtue prove  I feel but thee and breathe not but to love  Repent in vain scarce wish to be forgiven  Thy form my idol and thy charms my heaven  Yet yet my fair thy nobler efforts try  Lift me from earth and give me to the sky  Let my lost soul thy brighter virtues feel  Warm'd with thy hopes and wing'd with all thy zeal  And when low bending at the hallow'd shrine  Thy contrite heart shall Abelard resign  When pitying heaven impatient to forgive  Unbars the gates of light and bids thee live  Seize on th'auspicious moment ere it flee  And ask the same immortal boon for me  Then when these black terrific scenes are o'er  And rebel nature chills the soul no more  When on thy cheek th' expiring roses fade  And thy last lustres darken in the shade  When arm'd with quick varieties of pain  Or creeping dully slow from vein to vein  Pale death shall set my kindred spirit free  And these dead orbs forget to doat on thee  Some pious friend whose wild affections glow  Like ours in sad similitude of woe  Shall drop one tender sympathizing tear  Prepare the garland and adorn the bier  Our lifeless reliques in one tomb enshrine  And teach thy genial dust to mix with mine  Mean while divinely purg'd from every stain  Our active souls shall climb th' etherial plain  To each bright cherub's purity aspire  Catch ali his zeal and pant with all his fire  There where no face the glooms of anguish wears  No uncle murders and no passion tears  Enjoy with heaven eternity of rest  For ever blessing and for ever blest  DEATH  BY CHARLES EMILY ESQ  I  THE festive roar of laughter the warm glow  Of briskey'd joy and friendship's genial bowl  Wit's season'd converse and the liberal flow  Of unsuspicious youth profuse of soul  Delight not ever from the boisterous scene  Of riot far and Comus' wild uproar  From folly's crowd whose vacant brow serene  Was never knit to wisdom's srowning lore  Permit me ye timehallow'd domes ye piles  Of rude magnificence your solemn rest  Amid your fretted vaults and length'ning isles  Lonely to wander no unholy guest  That means to break with sacrilegious tread  The marble slumbers of your monumented dead  II  Permit me with sad musings that inspire  Unlabour'd numbers apt your silence drear  Blameless to wake and with th'

forest hill or browsed dale  The victims each of ruthless fate must fall  E'en God's own image man high paramount of all  III  And ye the young the giddy and the gay  That startle from the sleepful lid of light  The curtain'd rest and with the dissonant bray  Of Bacchus and loud jollity affright  Yon radiant goddess that now shoots among  These many windowed isles her glimmering beam  Know that or e'er its starr'd career along  Thrice shall have roll'd her silverywheeled team  Some parent breast may heave the answering sigh  To the slow pauses of the funeral knoll  E'en now black Atropos

trance  The mute attention rivetting to the lyre  Struck language dimm'd the poet's quickey'd glance  All in wild raptures flashing heaven's own fire  Shrunk is the sinew'd energy that strung  The warrior arm where sleeps the patriot breast  Whilom that heav'd impassion'd Where the tongue  That lanc'd its lightning on the towering crest  Of scepter'd insolence and overthrew  Giant Oppression leagued with all her earthborn crew  VI  These now are past long long ye fleeting years  Pursue with glory wing'd your fated way  Ere from the womb of time unwelcome peers  The dawn of that inevitable day  When wrapt in shrouded clay their warmest friend  The widow'd virtues shall again deplore  When o'er his urn in pious grief shall bend  His Britain and bewail one patriot more  For soon must thou

endearing tie  The parent everhonour'd everdear  Claims from the filial breast the pious sigh  A brother's urn demands the kindred tear  And gentle sorrows gush from friendship's eye  Today we frolick in the rosy bloom  Of jocund youthThe morrow knells us to the tomb  VIII  Who knows how soon in this sepulchral spot  Shall heaven to me the drear abode assign  How soon the past irrevocable lot  Of

RETURN FROM VIEWING THE MINES NEAR WHITEHAVEN  BY DR DALTON  WELCOME to light advent'rous pair  Thrice welcome to the balmy air  From sulph'rous damps in caverns deep  From sulph'rous damps  c The coal mines near Whitehaven are greatly infested with fulminating damps large quantities of them being frequently collected in those deserted works which are not ventilated with perpetual currents of fresh air and in such works they often remain for a long time without doing any mischief But when by some accident they are set on fire they then produce dreadful explosions very destructive to the miners and bursting out of the pits with great impetuosity like the fiery eruptions from burning mountains force along with them ponderous bodies to a great height in the air    Where subterranean thunders sleep  Or wak'd with dire Aetnaean sound  Bellow the trembling mountain round  Till to the srighted realms of day  Thro' flaming mouths they force their way  From bursting streams  From bursting streams  c The coal in these mines hath several times been set on fire by the fulminating damp and hath continued burning for many months until large streams of water were conducted into the mines and suffered to fill those parts where the coal was on fire By such fires several collieries have been intirely destroyed of which there are instances near Newcastle and in other parts of England and in the shire of Fife in Scotland in some of which places the fire has continued burning for ages But more mines have been ruined by inundations  and burning rocks  From nature's fierce inte  ine shocks  From the dark mansions of despair  Welcome once more to light and air  But why explore that world of night  Conceal'd till then from female sight  Such grace and beauty why confine  One moment to a dreary mine  Was it because your curious eye  The secrets of the earth would spy  How intervein'd rich minerals glow  How bubbling fountains learn to flow  Or rather that the sons of day  Already own'd your rightful sway  And therefore like young Ammon you  Another world would fain subdue  What tho' sage Prospero attend  While you the cavern'd hill descend  Tho' warn'd by him with bended head  You shun the shelving roof and tread  With cautious foot the rugged way  While tapers strive to mimic day  Tho' he with hundred gates and chains  The Daemons of the mine restrains  The daemons of the mine restrains  c In order to prevent as much as possible the collieries from being filled with those pernicious damps it has been found necessary carefully to search for those crevises in the coal from whence they issue out and at those places to confine them within a narrow space and from those narrow spaces in which they are confined to conduct them through long pipes into the open air where being set on fire they consume in perpetual flames as they continually arise out of the earth    To whom their parent jealous earth  To guard her hidden stores gave birth  At which while kindred furies sung  With hideous joy pale Orcus rung  Tho' boiling with vain rage they sit  Fix'd to the bottom of the pit  While at his beck the spi'rits of air  With breath of heaven their taints repair  Or if they seek superior skies  Thro' ways assign'd by him they rise  Troop after troop at day expire  In torments of perpetual fire  Tho' he with furyquelling charms  The whole infernal host disarms  And summons  And summons  c Those who have the direction of these deep and extensive works are obliged to use great care and art in keeping them continually ventilated with perpetual currents of fresh air which afford the miners a constant supply of that vital fluid and expel out of the mines damps and other noxious exhalations together with such other burnt and foul air as is become poisonous and unfit for respiration  to your guarded sides  A squadron of etherial guides  You still when we together view  The dreadful enterprize and you  The public care and wonder go  Of all above and all below  For at your presence toil is o'er  The restless miner works no more  Nor strikes the flint  Nor strikes the flint  c It having been observed by Mr Spedding who superintends these collieries and to whom the author here gives the name of Prospero that the fulminating damp could only be kindled by flame and that it was not liable to be set on fire by redhot iron nor by the sparks produced by the collision of flint and steel he invented a machine in which while a steel wheel is turned round with a very rapid motion and flints are applied thereto great plenty of fiery sparks are emitted that afford the miners such a light as enables them to carry on their work in close places where the flame of a candle or lamp would occasion dreadful explosions Without some invention of this sort the working of these mines so greatly annoyed with these inflammable damps would long ago have been impracticable  nor whirls the steel  Of that strange sparkemitting wheel  Which form'd by Prospero's magic care  Plays harmless in the sulphurous air  Without a flame diffuses light  And makes the grisly cavern bright  His task secure the miner plies  Nor hears Tartarian tempests rise  But quits it now and hastes away  To this great Stygian holiday  Agape the sooty collier stands  His axe suspended in his hands  His Aethiopian teeth the while  " Grin horribly a ghastly smile"  To see two goddesses so fair  Descend to him from fields of air  Not greater wonder seiz'd th' abode  Of gloomy Dis infernal god  With pity when th' Orphean lyre  Did every iron heart inspire  Sooth'd tortur'd ghosts with heavenly strains  And respited eternal pains  But on you move  But on you move  c The reader may suppose that he hath entered these mines by the opening at the bottom of a hill and hath already passed through a long adit hewn in the rock and arched over with brick which is the principal road into them for men and for horses and which by a steep descent leads down to the lowest vein of coal Being arrived at the coal he may suppose himself still to descend by ways less steep till after a journey of a mile and a half he arrives at the profoundest parts of the mine The greatest part of this descent is through spacious galleries which continually intersect other galleries all the coal being cut away except large pillars which in deep parts of the mine are three yards high and about twelve yards square at the base such great strength being there required to support the ponderous roof  thro' ways less steep  To loftier chambers of the deep  Whose jetty pillars seem to groan  Beneath a ponderous roof of stone  Then with increasing wonder gaze  The dark inextricable maze  Where cavern crossing cavern meets  City of subterraneous streets  Where in a triple  A triple story  c There are here three strata of coal which lie at a considerable distance one above another The mines wrought in these parallel strata have a communication by pits and are compared by the author to the different stories of a building  story end  Mines that o'er mines by flights ascend  But who in order can relate  What terror still your steps await  How issuing from the sulphurous coal  Thick Acherontic rivers  Thick Acherontic rivers  c The water that flows from the coal is collected into one stream which runs towards the fireengines This water is yellow and turbid from a mixture of ocher and so very corrosive that it quickly consumes iron  roll  How in close center of these mines  Where orient morning never shines  Nor the wing'd zephyrs e'er resort  Infernal darkness holds her court  How breathless with faint pace and slow  How breathless with faint pace and slow  c Those who descend into these mines find them most close and sultry in the middle parts that are most remote from the pits and adits and perceive them to grow cooler the nearer they approach to those pits which are sunk to the deepest parts of the mines down which pits large streams of fresh air are made to descend and up which the water is drawn out by means of fireengines    Thro' her grim sultry realm you go  Till purer rising gales dispense  Their cordials to the sickening sense  Your progress next the wondering muse  Thro' narrow galleries pursues  Where earth  Where earth  c The vein of coal is not always regularly continued in the same inclined plane but instead thereof the miners frequently meet with hard rock which interrupts their further progress At such places there seem to have been breaks in the earth from the surface downwards one part of the earth seeming to have sunk down while the part adjoining has remained in its ancient situation In some of these places the earth may have sunk ten or twenty fathoms or more in other places less than one fathom These breaks the miners call Dykes and when they come at one of them their first care is to discover whether the starta in the part adjoining be higher or lower than in the part where they have been working or to use their own terms whether the coal be cast down or cast up If it be cast down they sink a pit to it but if it be cast up to any considerable height they are oftentimes obliged with great labour and expence as at the place here described to carry forwards a level or long gallery through the rock until they again arrive at the stratum of coal  the miner's way to close  Did once the massy rock oppose  In vain his daring axe he heaves  Tow'rds the black vein a passage cleaves  Dissever'd by the nitrous blast  The stubborn barrier bursts at last  Thus urg'd by hunger's clamorous call  Incessant labour conquers all  In spacious rooms once more you tread  Whose roofs  Whose roofs  c These colours with which the freestone roof of the mines is beautifully variegated in many places and which have the appearance of clouds seem to proceed from exsudations of salts other and other earthy substances  with figures quaint o'erspread  Wild nature paints with various dyes  With such as tinge the evening skies  A different scene to this succeeds  The dreary road abruptly leads  Down to the cold and humid caves  Where hissing fall the turbid waves  Resounding deep thro' glimmering shades  The clank of chains your ears invades  Thro' pits profound from distant day  Scarce travels down light's languid ray  High on huge axis heav'd above  See ballanc'd beams unweary'd move  While pent within the iron womb  While pent within the iron womb  c The author hath here taken occasion to celebrate the fireengine the invention of which does such honour to this nation He has endeavoured to describe in a poetic manner the effects of the elastic steam and the great power of the atmosphere which by their alternate actions give force and motion to the beam of this engine and by it to the pumprods which elevate the water through tubes and discharge it out of the mine It appears from pretty exact calculations that it would require about men or a power equal to that of horses to work the pumps of one of the largest fireengines now in use the diameter of whose cylinder is seventy inches and thrice that number of men to keep an engine of this size constantly at work And that as much water may be raised by an engine of this size kept constantly at work as can be drawn up by men with rollers and buckets after the manner now daily practised in many mines or as much as can be borne up on the shoulders of twice that number of men as is said to be done in some of the mines of PeruSo great is the power of the air in one of those engines  There are four fireengines belonging to this colliery which when all at work discharge from it about gallons every minute at thirteen strokes gallons every twentyfour hours By the four engines here employed nearly twice the abovementioned quantity of water might be discharged from mines that are not above sixty or seventy fathoms deep which depth is rarely exceeded in the Newcastle collieries or in any of the English collieries those of Whitehaven excepted  The reader may find an account of Savery's engine in Harris's Lexicon TechnicumMany great improvements have been made to it since and are daily making several of which are related in the Philosophical Transactions The best account of it its various improvement and uses is I think in Dr Desaguliers's course of experimental philosophy vol  Of boiling caldrons pants for room  Expanded steam and shrinks or swells  As cold restrains or heat impells  And ready for the vacant space  Incumbent air resumes his place  Depressing with stupendous force  Whate'er resists his downward course  Pumps mov'd by rods from ponderous beams  Arrest the unsuspecting streams  Which soon a sluggish pool would lie  Then spout them foaming to the sky  Sagacious Savery taught by thee  Discordant elements agree  Fire water air heat cold unite  And lifted in one service fight  Pure streams to thirsty cities send  Or deepest mines from floods defend  Man's richest gift thy work will shine  Rome's aqueducts were poor to thine  At last the long descent is o'er  Above your heads the billows roar  Above your heads  c The mines are here sunk to the depth of one hundred and thirty fathoms and are extended under the sea to places where there is above them sufficient depth of water for ships of large burden These are the deepest coalmines that have hitherto been wrought and perhaps the miners have not in any other part of the globe penetrated to so great a depth below the surface of the sea the very deep mines in Hungary Peru and elsewhere being situated in mountainous countries where the surface of the earth is elevated to a great height above the level of the ocean    High o'er your heads they roar in vain  Not all the surges of the main  The dark recess can e'er disclose  Rocks heap'd on rocks th'attempt oppose  Thrice Dover's cliff from you the tides  With interposing roof divides  From such abyss restor'd to light  Invade no more the realms of night  For heroines it may well suffice  Once to have left these azure skies  Heroes themselves in days of yore  Bold as they were atchiev'd no more  Without a dread descent you may  The mines in their effects survey  And with an easy eye look down  On that fair port and happy town  Where late along the naked strand  The fisher's cot did lonely stand  And his poor bark unshelter'd lay  Of every swelling surge the prey  Now lofty piers their arms extend  And with their strong embraces bend  Round crowded fleets which safe defy  All storms that rend the wintry sky  And bulwark beyond bulwarks chain  The fury of the roaring main  The peopled vale fair dwellings fill  And length'ning streets ascend the hill  Where industry intent to thrive  Brings all her honey to the hive  Religion strikes with reverent awe  Example works th' effect of law  And plenty's flowing cup we see  Untainted yet by luxury  These are the glories of the mine  Creative commerce these are thine  Here while delighted you impart  Delight to every eye and heart  Behold grown jealous of your stay  Your native stream  Your native stream  c The river Lowther  his charms display  To court you to his banks again  Now wind in wanton waves his train  Now spread into a chrystal plain  Then hid by pendent rocks would steal  But tuneful falls his course reveal  As down the bending vale he roves  Thro' Yanwath woods and Buckholme's groves  Whose broad o'erspreading boughs beneath  Warbling he flows while zephyrs breathe  Here softly swells the spacious lawn  Where bounds the buck and skips the fawn  Or couch'd beneath the hawthorntrees  In dappled groups enjoy the breeze  Amid yon sunny plain alone  To patriarchal reverence grown  An oak for many an age has stood  Himself a widely waving wood  While men and herds with swift decay  Race after race have pass'd away  See still his central trunk sustain  Huge boughs which round o'erhang the plain  And hospitable shade inclose  Where flocks and herds at ease repose  There the brown fells ascend the sky  Below the green inclosures lie  Along their sloping sides supine  The peaceful villages recline  On azure roofs  On azure roofs  c The houses of this country are covered with a beautiful blue slate  bright sunbeams play  And make the meanest dwelling gay  Thus oft the wise allruling Mind  Is to the lowly cottage kind  Bids there his beams of favour fall  While sorrow crowds the lofty hall  That this may fear his awful frown  And grateful that his goodness own  If grown familiar to the sight  Lowther itself should less delight  Then change the scene to nature's pride  Sweet  Sweet Keswick's vale  c This delightful vale is thus elegantly described by the late ingenious Dr Brown in a letter to a friend  "In my way to the north from Hagley I passed through Dovedale and to say the truth was disappointed in it When I came to Buxton I visited another or two of their romantic scenes but these are inferior to Dovedale They are all but poor miniatures of Keswick which exceeds them more in grandeur than I can give you to imagine and more if possible in beauty than in grandeur  "Instead of the narrow slip of valley which is seen at Dovedale you have at Keswick a vast amphitheatre in circumference above twenty miles Instead of a meagre rivulet a noble living lake ten miles round of an oblong form adorned with a variety of wooded islands The rocks indeed of Dovedale are finely wild pointed and irregular but the hilis are both little and unanimated and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds morass and brushwood But at Keswick you will on one side of the lake see a rich and beautiful landskip of cultivated fields rising to the eye in fine inequalities with noble groves of oak happily dispersed and climbing the adjacent hills shade above shade in the most various and picturesque forms On the opposite shore you will find rocks and cliffs of stupendous height hanging broken over the like in horrible grandeur some of them a thousand feet high the woods climbing up their steep and shaggy sides where mortal foot never yet approached on these dreadful heights the eagles build their nests a variety of waterfalls are seen pouring from their summits and tumbling in vast sheets from rock to rock in rude and terrible magnificence while on all sides of this immense amphitheatre the lofty mountains rise round piercing the clouds in shapes as spiry and fantastic as the very rocks of Dovedale To this I must add the frequent and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake forming noble bays and promontories in other parts they finely retire from it and often open in abrupt chasms or clefts through which at hand you see rich and uncultivated vales and beyond these at various distance mountain rising over mountain among which new prospects present themselves in mist till the eye is lost in an agreeable perplexity  Where active fancy travels beyond sense  And pictures things unseen  Were I to analyse the two places into their constituent principles I should tell you that the full perfection of Keswick consists of three circumstances beauty horror and immensity united the second of which alone is found in Dovedale Of beauty it hath little nature having left it almost a desert neither its small extent nor the diminutive and lifeless form of the hills admit magnificence but to give you a complete idea of these three perfections as they are joined in Keswick would require the united powers of Claude Salvator and Poussin The first should throw his delicate sunshine over the cultivated vales the scattered cots the groves the lake and wooded islands The second should dash out the horror of the rugged cliffs the steeps the hanging woods and foaming waterfalls while the grand pencil of Poussin should crown the whole with the majesty of the impending mountains  "So much for what I would call the permanent beauties of this astonishing seene Were I not afraid of being tiresome I could now dwell as long on its varying or accidental beauties I would sail round the lake anchor in every bay and land you on every promontory and island I would point out the perpetual change of prospect the woods rocks cliffs and mountains by turns vanishing or rising into view now gaining on the sight hanging over our heads in their full dimensions beautifully dreadful and now by a change of situation assuming new romantic shapes retiring and lessening on the eye and insensibly losing themselves in an azure mist I would remark the contrast of light and shade produced by the morning and evening sun the one gilding the western the other the eastern side of this immense amphitheatre while the vast shadow projected by the mountains buries the opposite part in a deep and purple gloom which the eye can hardly penetrate the natural variety of colouring which the several objects produce is no less wonderful and pleasing the ruling tincts in the valley being those of azure green and gold yet ever various arising from an intermixture of the lake the woods the grass and cornfields these are finely contrasted by the grey rocks and cliffs and the whole heightened by the yellow streams of light the purple hues and misty azure of the mountains Sometimes a serene air and clear sky disclose the tops of the highest hills at others you see the clouds involving their summits resting on their sides or descending to their base and rolling among the vallies as in a vast furnace when the winds are high they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder then too the clouds are seen in vast bodies sweeping along the hills in gloomy greatness while the lake joins the tumult and tosses like a sea but in calm weather the whole scene becomes new the lake is a perfect mirror and the landskip in all its beauty islands fields woods rocks and mountains are seen inverted and floating on its surface I will now carry you to the top of a cliff where if you dare approach the ridge a new scene of astonishment presents itself where the valley lake and islands seem lying at your feet where this expanse of water appears diminished to a little pool amidst the vast and immeasurable objects that surround it for here the summits of more distant hills appear beyond those you have already seen and  ising behind each other in successive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken steeps form an immense and awful picture which can only be expressed by the image of a tempestuous sea of mountains Let me now conduct you down again to the valley and conclude with one circumstance more which is that a walk by still moonlight at which time the distant waterfalls are heard in all their variety of sound among these inchanting dales open such scenes of delicate beauty repose and solemnity as exceed all description  Keswick's vale the muse will guide  The muse who trod th'inchanted ground  Who sail'd the wonderous lake around  With you will haste once more to hail  The beauteous brook of Borrodale  From savage parent gentle stream  Be thou the muse's favourite theme  O soft insinuating glide  Silent along the meadow's side  Smooth o'er the sandy bottom pass  Resplendent all thro' fluid glass  Unless upon thy yielding breast  Their painted heads the lilies rest  To where in deep capacious bed  The widely liquid lake is spread  Let other streams rejoice to roar  Down the rough rocks of dread Lodore  Of dread Lodore  c A very high caseade here falls into the lake of Derwentwater near where Borrodalebeck or brook enters into it as described above    Rush raving on with boisterous sweep  And soaming rend the frighted deep  Thy gentle genius shrinks away  From such a rude unequal fray  Thro' thine own native dale where rise  Tremendous rocks amid the skies  Thy waves with patience slowly wind  Till they the smoothest channel find  Soften the horrors of the scene  And thro' confusion flow serene  Horrors like these at first alarm  But soon with savage grandeur charm  And raise to noblest thoughts your mind  Thus by thy fall Lodore reclin'd  The cragged cliff impendent wood  Whose shadows mix o'er half the flood  The gloomy clouds which solemn sail  Scarce lifted by the languid gale  O'er the capp'd hill and darken'd vale  The ravening kite and bird of Jove  Which round th' aëreal ocean rove  And floating on the billowy sky  With full expanded pennons fly  Their fluttering or their bleating prey  Thence with deathdooming eye survey  Channels by rocky torrents torn  Channels by rocky torrents torn  c For an account of an extraordinary storm in a part of this country called St John's vale by which numerous fragments of rocks were driven down from the mountains along with cataracts of water see a letter from Cockermouth inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine of October    Rocks to the lake in thunder borne  Or such as o'er our heads appear  Suspended in their mid career  To start again at his command  Who rules fire water air and land  I view with wonder and delight  A pleasing tho' an awful sight  For seen with them the verdant isles  Soften with more delicious smiles  More tempting twine their opening bowers  More lively glow the purple flowers  More smoothly slopes the border gay  In fairer circle bends the bay  And last to fix our wandering eyes  Thy roofs O Keswick brighter rise  The

loitering in their villas stay  Till useless summers waste away  While hopeless of their lord's return  The poor exhausted tenants mourn  From Lowther she disdains to run  To bask beneath a southern

merry vein  Her unpremeditated strain  And did from heedless joy neglect  To greatness every grave respect  This muse I say inconstant grown  Forsook me when I came to town  Friend to my fortune she withdrew  When I left PercyLodge and you  Since then in vain I ask her aid  In vain her cruelty upbraid  The town she says was ne'er her choice  If there she tries to raise her voice  Her strains are to their theme unjust  Or drown'd in noise or choak'd with dust  Her plea is good The muse's theme  Like the pure bright harmonious stream  Ne'er but in rural channels flows  Cities and bards are endless foes  Resolv'd Parnassus' top to climb  Part of a Verse of Milton's  And there to build the lofty rhyme  I to fam'd Claremont's height aspire  To borrow thence poetic fire  To waft like Cooper'sHill its name  On wings of everlasting fame  Or if that bold attempt be vain  Your partial ear to entertain  I mount my chaise the space between  Fancy anticipates the scene  And Vanity officious maid  Thus offers her selfpleasing aid  " Poor Vanbrugh's plan is out of date  " And Garth but saw its rising state  " His verse with tuneful fable rung  " But left its real charms unsung  " But now to my transported eyes  " In full maturity will rise  " The bowers the temples and the groves  " That Kent has plann'd and Pelham loves  At length awaken'd from my dream  My eyes behold the real theme  And the gay sketch that fancy drew  They find more amiably true  On a neat structure now they rest  Where rural plainness is exprest  With harvests stor'd compact and warm  And tho' Palladian yet a farm  Whence cars in rustic order drawn  Pass and repass the sloping lawn  While flocks in fleecy groups around  Or moving crop the daisy'd ground  Or sunk beneath the tufted trees  Turn languid to the noontide breeze  The lustier herds in glare of day  Bask and imbibe the sunny ray  While these I view on humid wings  The sultry south a tempest brings  Black clouds invest the low'ring skies  And all the beauteous vision flies  Now from the thickdescending rain  I drive across the darken'd plain  And leave the lovely scene behind  That just began to charm my mind  How rare does pleasure stand the test  With patience now I arm my breast  And in a moralizing vein  With thoughts like these my grief restrain  " The skies are clear when storms are o'er  " Again smooth waves salute the shore  " Each sun but sets to rise again  " And gild with morn the dewy plain  " This hour perhaps hope cheats the mind  " The next an equal joy we find"  Just so the house a shelter lends  Within I find the best of friends  Spence whose soft bosom oft has known  To make another's woe her own  She now with hospitable grace  Compassionates my present case  Asks of your health and hears with joy  How you your growing strength employ  In rural cares and exercise  And kind congratulations rise  When on my favourite theme I dwell  And Beauchamp's rising virtues tell  Fondly the vanity I share  And recollect my pleasing care  That with parental aid combin'd  Founded the structure of his mind  So boastful builders call their own  Works where they laid the first rude stone  The storm subsides the mount I gain  Thence dart my eyes across the plain  Full swelling to the sight I found  First holy Paul's majestic round  Thro' wide Augusta's smoak and now  Rose lofty Windsor's tow'red brow  Here glitter streams of vulgar names  There slowly winds imperial Thames  On his green banks in level line  Here spacious Hampton's turrets shine  Whose windows kindling at the ray  Of Sol beam back redoubled day  Towns villages and pointed spires  And smoak thickwreath'd from cottagefires  And planted villas intervene  To grace the sweetlyvary'd scene  O'er all my eyes transported range  With every glance the visions change  Till drawn by beauties nearer home  Along the lovely park I roam  Now skim the walk descend the glade  Then plunge into the deepest shade  Here flourish sweets in mingled bloom  There worthy ancient Greece or Rome  Fair temples opening to the sight  Surprise each turn with new delight  In pleasure lost I wish to gaze  At once a thousand different ways  Awful or pleasing every part  Expands the soul or glads the heart  Great open liberal unconfin'd  Just emblem of its master's mind  Who knows unequall'd state to shew  Yet gracious stoops to all below  Beneath a hill whose hoary brow  Ne'er felt the wound of scythe or plow  Along whose wild and heathy side  Britannia's  About that time the crew of the Centurion were expected to pass by from Portsmouth with the prizemoney taken from the Acapulca ship  naval heroes ride  When they with colours wide display'd  That proud Iberia's sons upbraid  In tawny troop from India's shore  Guard in rough pomp their captive ore  Mid circling waters lies an isle  Whose verdant shores reflected smile  With Flora's painted hues above  Softbosom'd in a shady grove  A dome but half reveal'd to sight  Chequers the boughs with Parian white  If chance from hence at evening fair  The rising song soft steals on air  Which to the wellaccording strings  The skillful voice sweetwarbling sings  The passing swain suspended stands  And wondering lifts to heaven his hands  Doubts if beneath some leafy spray  Soft Philomela pours her lay  Or some blest spirit from above  Enchants with harmony the grove  Nor guesses that the tuneful art  Which awes and charms his simple heart  Is hers whose bounty loves to bless  Sad sickening want and lone distress  And hers the sweet enchanting song  To whom the listening groves belong  And all that her Newcastle's art  In boundless fondness can impart  Each level walk each shelving glade  Whate'er employs the labourer's spade  Whate'er rewards his patient toil  And makes the barren desert smile  This isle in tempting prospect stands  Thither I stretch my eyes and hands  Eager the farther shore to gain  But stretch my hands and eyes in vain  For hark the threat'ning winds arise  Again with clouds obscure the skies  And tell my baffled hopes that this  Is an inchanted isle of bliss  Now in near prospect blooming fair  And now involv'd in black despair  My chaise regain'd I cross the plain  When lo the sun beams forth again  Hope gay impostor points the way  Where near the road fair Esher lay  And who at Esher would not stay  I turn'd Retiring from the town  The noble owner just came down  I saw the gate behind him close  Then murmur'd at this short repose  From cares for Britain's safety shewn  Grudg'd his repose who guards my own  I now pursue my former way  And with my journey ends this day  Of hope and fear and pain and pleasure  Of all my other days the measure  Yours a more even tenor know  And scarce perceive an ebb or flow  The cause is plain To fortune's gale  You cautious never spread a sail  Safe in your port content at home  You ne'er for painful pleasure roam  And think it folly if not sin  One night to sojourn at an inn  Nay when the Atlas of our state  Throws off for you a nation's weight  In courtly terms your ear to greet  And cast himself beneath your feet  You like Egeria in your grott  Or seek he must or finds you not  More cautious still e'en when retir'd  By wits nor censur'd nor admir'd  You say tho' every art your friend  You dare to no one art pretend  Your fear is just Each state and nation  Assigns to woman reputation  While man asserts his wider claim  Jealous proprietor of same  Yet sure without offence you may  On nature's open leaf display  Your harmless unambitious skill  To sink a grott or slope a hill  A dell with flowers adorn or lead  A winding rill along the mead  Or bid opposing trees be join'd  In hospitable league intwin'd  Without their leave whose madness dares  Rouze human states to cruel wars  Or if the Bourbon of the air  Against your feather'd folk declare  Fell war betake you to th' alliance  Of net or gun and bid defiance  To every robber small or great  That would disturb your calm retreat  O may kind heaven propitious smile  On every art that can beguile  A son's long absence from your sight  And render back that just delight  From those distracting dire alarms  That set a jarring world in arms  From tainted air's infectious breath  Where flies unseen the dart of death  His steps ye guardian angels guide  And turn the fatal shaft aside  Return'd his parent's bliss to crown  And make all earth can give their own  Like Smithson's may his manly heart  Act not the vain but generous part  Call drooping art from her recess  With health and ease and fame to bless  O may like his his riper age  With caution tread the civil stage  Like him th' enchanted cup put by  And every vain temptation fly  Of power or pension place or name  If meant statetraps that sink to shame  Yet his just Prince without a bribe  Lovemore than all the venal tribe  But from these themes I now refrain  Reserv'd to grace a future strain  For I have trespass'd on your time  And see a tedious length of rhyme  What must it then appear to you  Respectful most this short adieu  SOME THOUGHTS ON BUILDING and PLANTING TO Sir JAMES LOWTHER Bart OF

come down to us but this and a few fragments which are printed by H Stephens in a collection of philosophical poems    BY GILBERT WEST ESQ  O Under various sacred names ador'd  Divinity supreme allpotent Lord  Author of nature whose unbounded sway  And legislative power all things obey  Majestic Jove all hail To thee belong  The suppliant prayer and tributary song  To thee from all thy mortal offspring due  From thee we came from thee our being drew  Whatever lives and moves great Sire is thine  Embodied portions of the soul divine  Therefore to thee will I attune my string  And of thy wondrous power for ever sing  The wheeling orbs the wandering fires above  That round this earthly sphere incessant move  Through all this boundless world admit thy sway  And roll spontaneous where thou point'st the way  Such is the awe imprest on nature round  When through the void thy dreadful thunders sound  Those flaming agents of thy matchless power  Astonish'd worlds hear tremble and adore  Thus paramount to all by all obey'd  Ruling that reason which thro' all convey'd  Informs this general mass thou reign'st ador'd  Supreme unbounded universal Lord  For nor in earth nor earthencircling floods  Nor yon etherial pole the seat of gods  Is ought perform'd without thy aid divine  Strength wisdom virtue mighty Jove are thine  Vice is the act of man by passion tost  And in the shoreless sea of folly lost  But thou what vice disorders canst compose  And profit by the malice of thy foes  So blending good with evil fair with foul  As thence to model one harmonious whole  One universal law of truth and right  But wretched mortals shun the heavenly light  And tho' to bliss directing still their choice  Hear not or heed not reason's sacred voice  That common guide ordain'd to point the road  That leads obedient man to solid good  Thence quitting virtue's lovely paths they rove  As various objects various passions move  Some thro' opposing crowds and threatning war  Seek power's bright throne and fame's triumphal car  Some bent on wealth pursue with endless pain  Oppressive sordid and dishonest gain  While others to soft indolence resign'd  Drown in corporeal sweets th'immortal mind  But O great father thunderruling God  Who in thick darkness mak'st thy dread abode  Thou from whose bounty all good gifts descend  Do thou from ignorance mankind defend  The clouds of vice and folly O controul  And shed the beams of wisdom on the soul  Those radiant beams by whose allpiercing flame  Thy justice rules this universal frame  That honour'd with a portion of thy light  We may essay thy goodness to requite  With honorary songs and grateful lays  And hymn thy glorious works with ceaseless praise  The proper task of man and sure to sing  Of nature's laws and nature's mighty king  Is bliss supreme Let gods with mortals join  The subject may transport a breast divine  INSCRIPTION ON A SUMMERHOUSE BELONGING TO GILBERT WEST ESQ AT WICKHAM IN KENT  BY THE SAME  NOT wrapt in smoky London's sulphurous clouds  And not far distant stands my rural cot  Neither obnoxious to intruding crowds  Nor for the good and friendly too remote  And when too much repose brings on the spleen  Or the gay city's idle pleasure's cloy  Swift as my changing wish I shift the scene  And now the country now the town enjoy  THE HOUSE OF SUPERSTITION A VISION  BY MR DENTON  I  WHEN Sleep's allsoothing hand with fetters soft  Ties down each sense and lulls to balmy rest  The internal power creative Fancy oft  Broods o'er her treasures in the formful breast  Thus when no longer daily cares engage  The busy mind pursues the darling theme  Hence angels whisper'd to the slumbering sage  And gods of old inspir'd the hero's dream  Hence as I slept these images arose  To Fancy's eye and join'd this fairy scene compose  II  As when fair morning dries her pearly tears  The mountain lifts o'er mists its lofty head  Thus new to sight a gothic dome appears  With the grey rust of rolling years o'erspread  Here Superstition holds her dreary reign  And her liplabour'd orisons she plies  In tongue unknown when morn bedews the plain  Or evening skirts with gold the western skies  To the dumb stock she bends or sculptur'd wall  And many a cross she makes and many a bead lets fall  III  Near to the dome a magic pair reside  Prompt to deceive and practis'd to confound  Here hoodwinkt Ignorance is seen to bide  Stretching in darksome cave along the ground  No object e'er awakes his stupid eyes  Nor voice articulate arrests his ears  Save when beneath the moon pale spectres rise  And haunt his soul with visionary fears  Or when hoarse winds incavern'd murmur round  And babbling echo wakes and iterates the sound  IV  Where boughs entwining form an artful shade  And in faint glimmerings just admit the light  There Error sits in borrow'd white array'd  And in Truth's form deceives the transient sight  A thousand glories wait her opening day  Her beaming lustre when fair Truth imparts  Thus Error would pour forth a spurious ray  And cheat th' unpractis'd mind with mimic arts  She cleaves with magic wand the liquid skies  Bids airy forms appear and scenes fantastic rise  V  A porter deaf decrepid old and blind  Sits at the gate and lifts a liberal bowl  With wine of wondrous power to lull the mind  And check each vigorous effort of the soul  Whoe'er un'wares shall ply his thirsty lip  And drink in gulps the luscious liquer down  Shall hapless from the cup delusion sip  And objects see in features not their own  Each wayworn traveller that hither came  He lav'd with copious draughts and Prejudice his name  VI  Within a various race are seen to wonne  Props of her age and pillars of her state  Which erst were nurtur'd by the wither'd crone  And born to Tyranny her griesly mate  The first appear'd in pomp of purple pride  With triple crown erect and throned high  Two golden keys hang dangling by his side  To lock or ope the portals of the sky  Crouching and prostrate there ah sight unmeet  The crowned head would bow and lick his dusty feet  VII  With bended arm he on a book reclin'd  Fast lock'd with iron clasps from vulgar eyes  Heaven's gracious gift to light the wandering mind  To lift fall'n man and guide him to the skies  A man no more a god he would be thought  And 'mazed mortals blindly must obey  With slight of hand he lying wonders wrought  And near him loathsome heaps of reliques lay  Strange legends would he read and figments dire  Of Limbus' prison'd shades and purgatory fire  VIII  There meagre Penance sat in sackcloth clad  And to his breast close hugg'd the viper Sin  Yet oft with brandish'd whip would gaul as mad  With voluntary stripes his shrivel'd skin  Counting large heaps of o'erabounding good  Of saints that dy'd within the church's pale  With gentler aspect there Indulgence stood  And to the needy culprit would retail  There too strange merchandize he pardons sold  And treason would absolve and murder purge with gold  IX  With shaven crown in a sequester'd cell  A lazy lubbard there was seen to lay  No work had he save some few beads to tell  And indolently snore the hours away  The nameless joys that bless the nuptial bed  The mystic rites of Hymen's hallow'd tye  Impure he deems and from them starts with dread  As crimes of foulest stain and deepest dye  No social hopes hath he no social fears  But spends in lethargy devout the lingering years  X  Gnashing his teeth in mood of furious ire  Fierce Persecution sat and with strong breath  Wakes into living flame large heaps of fire  And feasts on murders massacres and death  Near him was plac'd Procrustes' iron bed  To stretch or mangle to a certain size  To see their writhing pains each heart must bleed  To hear their doleful shrieks and piercing cries  Yet he beholds them with unmoistened eye  Their writhing pains his sport their moans his melody  XI  A gradual light diffusing o'er the gloom  And slow approaching with majestic pace  A lovely maid appears in beauty's bloom  With native charms and unaffected grace  Her hand a clear reflecting mirror shows  In which all objects their true features wear  And on her cheek a blush indignant glows  To see the horrid sorceries practis'd there  She suatch'd the volume from the tyrant's rage  Unlock'd its iron clasps and ope'd the heavenly page  XII  " My name is Truth and you each holy seer  " That all my steps with ardent gaze pursue  " Unveil she said the sacred mysteries here  " Give the celestial boon to public view  " Tho' blatant Obloquy with leprous mouth  " Shall blot your fame and blast the generous deed  " Yet in revolving years some liberal youth  " Shall crown your virtuous act with glory's meed  " Your names adorn'd in  The Reverend Mr William Gilpin author of the lives of Bernard Gilpin Bishop Latimer Wickliff and the principal of his followers  Gilpin's polish'd page  " With each historic grace shall shine thro' every age  XIII  " With furious hate tho' fierce relentless power  " Exert of torment all her horrid skill  " Tho' your lives meet too soon the fatal hour  " Scorching in flames or writhing on the wheel  " Yet when the  See Revel chap and the learned and ingenious Bishop of Bristol's comment upon it in the d vol of his dissertation on the prophecies  dragon in the deep abyss  " Shall lie fast bound in adamantine chain  " Ye with the Lamb shall rise to ceaseless bliss  " Firstfruits of death and partners of his reign  " Then shall repay the momentary tear  " The great sabbatic rest the millenary year"  ELEGIES  BY MR DELAP  ELEGY I  AH staythy wand oblivious o'er my eyes  Yet wave mild power of sleepmy prayer is vain  She flies the partial nurse of nature flies  With all her soothing visionary train  Then let me forth and near yon flowering thorn  Taste heaven's pure breath while rob'd in amber vest  Fresh from her watery couch the youthful morn  Steals on the slumbers of the drowsy east  Lo at her presence the strong arm of toil  With glittering sickle mows the prime of May  While yon poor hirelings for the mine's rude soil  Leave to their sleeping babes their cots of clay  With sturdy step they cheerly whistle o'er  The path that flings across the reedy plain  To the deep caverns of that yawning moor  Whose shaggy breast abhors the golden grain  There in her green dress nature never roves  Spreads the gay lawn nor lifts the lordly pine  They see no melting clouds refresh the groves  No living landscape drawn by hands divine  But many a fathom from the sunny breeze  Their painful way in central night they wear  Heave the pik'd axes on their bended knees  Or sidelong the rough quarry slowly tear  Yet while damp vapours chill each reeking brow  How loudly laughs the jovial voice of mirth  Pleas'd that the wages of the day allow  A social blaze to chear their evening hearth  There the chaste housewife with maternal care  Her thrifty distaff plies in grave attire  Blest to behold her ruddy offspring wear  The full resemblance of their sturdy fire  To spread with such coarse fare their homely board  As fits the genius of their little fate  Free from those ills that haunt their pamper'd lord  To be unhappy we must first be great  In these dark caves where heaven's paternal hand  Far from the world their private cradle laid  They toil secure the storms that strike the land  With wild dismay roll harmless o'er their head  For who the load of weary life to bear  Wou'd from these murky mansions chace the slave  Who cease to breathe heaven's pure and chearful air  To be but living tenants of the grave  Yet harrass'd as they are their face still wears  The reverend comeliness of green old age  No stains their mind from worldly science bears  Their ray of knowledge gleams from nature's page  The few plain rules her simple lessons give  They still thro' life with pleas'd attention ply  Their helpless offspring bid them wish to live  Their breathless parents bid them learn to die  And surely heaven whose penetrating sight  Pierces the soul and reads its inmost groan  Must see content with more sincere delight  Toil in the mine than triumph on the throne  See  Charles V of Spain who in the full blaze of his glory resigned the throne to his son Philip and retired to a convent in Estremadura  Charles more pleas'd within the convent's gloom  Seeking the slave's calm nights their temperate days  And peaceful passage to the private tomb  Than diadem'd with glory's crimson rays  Ev'n the proud sage whose deep mysterious brain  Has reason'd all the balm of hope away  Convinc'd that learning's but ingenious pain  Might hail their happier lot and sighing say  " Oh had I thus within the dark profound  " By daily labor earn'd my daily food  " Or with yon seedman sow'd the quickening ground  " Or cleav'd with ponderous axe the groaning wood  " Full many an hour that now tho' sped with art  " On slow and dusky pinions sullen flies  " Full many an anxious wish or pang of heart  " That reason's boasted anodyne defies  " Had ne'er been born Nor had th' uneasy mind  " Pent in the prison of this mortal mould  " Felt its etherial energy confin'd  " Its brightest sunshine in dark clouds enroll'd  " But native sense her modest course had run  " Her saintly lustre untaught virtue spread  " Health crown'd my toils and e'er the day was done  " Sound sleep beneath some alder's rustling shade  " Then as I stole down life's declining hill  " Here nature's gifts had furnish'd nature's needs  " The brook's cold beverage every latent ill  " Had starv'd that cloyster'd contemplation feeds  " Till in the peaceful shade of this lone bower  " Or near yon shattered tower in silence laid  " The orient orb that watch'd my natal hour  " Had brightly glitter'd o'er my mouldering head"  TO SICKNESS  ELEGY II  HOW blith the flowery graces of the Spring  From nature's wardrobe come and hark how gay  Each glittering insect hovering on the wing  Sings their glad welcome to the fields of May  They gaze with greedy eye each beauty o'er  They suck the sweet breath of the blushing rose  Sport in the gale or sip the rainbow shower  Their life's short day no pause of pleasure knows  Like their's dread power my chearful morn display'd  The flattering promise of a golden noon  Till each gay cloud that sportive nature spread  Died in the gloom of thy distemper'd frown  Yes ere I told my two and twentieth year  Swift from thy quiver flew the deadly dart  Harmless it past 'mid many a blithe compeer  And found its fated entrance near my heart  Pale as I lay beneath thy ebon wand  I saw them rove thro' pleasure's flowery field  I saw health paint them with her rosy hand  Eager to burst my bonds but forc'd to yield  Yet while this mortal cot of mouldering clay  Shakes at the stroke of thy tremendous power  Ah must the transient tenant of a day  Bear the rough blast of each tempestuous hour  Say shall the terrors thy pale flag unfolds  Too rigid queen unnerve the soul's bright powers  Till with a joyless smile the eye beholds  Art's magic charms and nature's fairy bowers  No let me follow still those bowers among  Her flowery footsteps as the goddess goes  Let me just lifted 'bove th' unletter'd throng  Read the few books the learned few compose  And suffer when pleasure awful pleasure calls  The soul to share her frail companion's smart  Yet suffer me to taste the balm that falls  From friendship's tongue so sweet upon the heart  Then tho' each trembling nerve confess thy frown  Ev'n till this anxious being shall become  But a brief name upon a little stone  Without one murmur I embrace my doom  For many a virtue shelter'd from mankind  Lives calm with thee and lord o'er each desire  And many a feeble frame whose mighty mind  Each muse has touch'd with her immortal fire  Even  Mr Pope  he sole terror of a venal age  The tuneful bard whose philosophic soul  With such bright radiance glow'd on virtue's page  Learn'd many a lesson from thy moral school  He  Mr Gray  too who "mounts and keeps his distant way"  His daring mind thy humanizing glooms  Have temper'd with a melancholy ray  And taught to warble 'mid the village tombs  Yes goddess to thy temple's deep recess  I come and lay for ever at its door  The siren throng of follies numberless  Nor wish their flattering songs should sooth me more  Thy decent garb shall o'er my limbs be spread  Thy hand shall lead me to thy sober train  Who here retir'd with pensive pleasure tread  The silent windings of thy dark domain  Hither the cherub Charity shall fly  From her bright orb and brooding o'er my mind  For misery raise a sympathizing sigh  Pardon for foes and love for humankind  Then while Ambition's trump from age to age  Its slaughter'd millions boasts while Fame shall rear  Her deathless trophies o'er the bard and sage  Be mine the widow's sigh the orphan's prayer  ODE TO LIBERTY  BY MR HUDSON  THE sable queen of shades retires  Encircled with her fading fires  Yok'd to her iron car the dragons fly  With slow wing blackening many a league of sky  Go melancholy goddess go  Nurse of despondency and woe  'Tis time the cock's shrill clarion calls  The dawn and strikes the prowling wolf with fear  And bids the phantoms disappear  That glimmer 'midst yon mouldering walls  They startle at the sound  And gliding o'er the trackless ground  Loth to their marble mansions haste away  No more their livid lightnings play  The terrors of aërial tumults cease  Hush'd to serenity and smiling peace  For lo in heaven's ambrosial bowers  Wak'd by the stationary hours  Parent of day the morn unveils her eyes  And vermeil blushes streak the orient skies  How nature triumphs at the sight  Renew'd in all her beauty bright  Her fragrant groves their incense yield  The zephyrs from her humid stores diffuse  The sweetness of mellifluous dews  And pleasure paints the lillied field  Here gilt with splendid rays  The spires and lofty turrets blaze  There the canals reflect a pleasing gleam  While dancing down the pebbly stream  The silver radiance chears the feather'd throng  Woods hills and dales reecho with their song  Thus like the morn will fairest Freedom come  In majesty divine  With dawning glory to disperse the gloom  Of dire Oppression and illume the mind  To darkness and despondency confin'd  Arise O Liberty 'tis thine  The charms of nature to refine  With blooming hope and harmony to please  To crown with plenty and to bless with ease  To light up awful Virtue's living ray  And pour the flood of intellectual day  Place me in Afric's desert lands  Where Thirst sits gaping on the sands  If there auspicious Freedom fix her seat  'Midst burning blasts I'll hail the rude retreat  Soon shall the wild more polish'd grown  Admire new beauties not her own  Sage Industry shall dig the well  Capacious yawning many a fathom deep  While lowing herds and bleating sheep  Stand frequent in the cooling cell  Soon shall the mantling vine  Be taught around the palm to twine  And social arts the stranger Naiads wake  That sleep beneath the distant lake  Curious to view young Commerce gayly roam  And bring full harvests to his barren home  Place me beneath the gelid zone  Near winter's adamantine throne  Where farthest ocean foams with icy roar  Along the bleak inhospitable shore  If Freedom to the smoky dome  With furcloath'd mortals deign to roam  Thro' snowy wastes the dome I'll seek  What hinders to enjoy the freezing year  For Property will there appear  And chearful Health with rosy cheek  Pursue the panting prey  Or mindful of the lengthen'd day  Sit chaunting on the mountain's chrystal brow  Where hanging torrents shine below  Nor will Cimmerian Sleep forget to bring  Safe slumbers waving at his downy wing  Come then Celestial let thy wish'd return  This happier clime serene  This happier clime if Rome thy absence mourn  No more with smiles of pleasure entertains  Nor Baia's groves nor rich Campania's plains  Heartless we view the splendid scene  Of turrets and the painted green  Heartless the music of the groves we hear  As when new harness'd out by Wrath and Fear  Night's chariot moves in storms and thunders hurl'd  Roll their broad terrors round the groaning world  ODE TO FANCY  BY THE SAME  WHERE art thou Fancy visionary maid  Whose lenient artifice and easy aid  Can quell the fierce disorders of the breast  And soothe the pensive soul to rest  Whether along the daisy bank reclin'd  With foliage veil'd you court the fanning wind  Or by the brook's loquacious channel stray  Where the deep dimpled eddies play  Haste thee from the blended glow  Of beauties in yon lucid bow  With fine spun light and golden beams  Softly weave thy waking dreams  Bid the rang'd ideas fly  Opening to the ravish'd eye  A glimpse of bliss where gay Desire is found  Sporting with Youth while music wakes around  Behold the variegated prospect rise  What gallant harmony what glad surprise  The sweet Mygdonian pipe with rural strains  Collects the nymphs and shepherd swains  Secure in yonder vale their fleecy breed  And heifers 'midst the neighbouring pastures feed  Meanwhile with flowrets deck'd each blithsome pair  Have bid adieu to pine and care  See them hand in hand advance  Circling in the smooth pac'd dance  Now to numbers quaint they stray  Bounding on the mazy way  The goldfinch and the linnet nigh  Join the simple minstrelsy  The simple notes and merry gambols fire  Plac'd by the hawthornhedge each ancient fire  But see where Solitude of sober mien  With Health and Modesty her charming maids  Leaving the strawroof'd neighbourhood is seen  To rove beneath the venerable shades  O harmless cottages O happy glades  Where no misfortunes factious rage deplore  No discontent the quiet breast invades  How pleasant 'tis from this far season'd shore  To hear the tumbling ocean's wavy roar  Now whither with the sunbeam's darting speed  Thy rapt enthusiast Fancy wilt thou lead  What other scenes of more sincere delight  The goddess and her guest invite  She like the Sybil with her golden bough  Descends to search the sacred realms below  In amaranthine bowers the blest appear  By pearly grot or fountain clear  To heroes ghosts or scepter'd kings  The laurell'd bard divinely sings  Hark the animating strains  Warble thro' th' Elysian plains  When the pause admits delay  Thus th' immortals seem to say  Closing the accents of each tuneful voice  " For ever thus for ever we rejoice"  What sad transition means this rising show  To drive out real pain with fancied woe  I see the mourners in the darken'd room  The rustic hearse the letter'd tomb  Still still the wayward wild ideas take  The solemn livery of death and wake  Tenderey'd pity as the village train  The shrouded husbandman sustain  What semblances of wretched plight  'Mid the procession strike the sight  Ah 'tis Grief herself appears  Her flowing tresses steep'd in tears  Her garments torn her bosom bare  Reckless of th' inclement air  Three orphan children mark their mother's moan  Hang down their heads and answer groan for groan  Hence hence ye hapless images away  Delusive Fancy with thy subtle heat  No more thy vain machinery display  Now the dark grave and now the green retreat  Contentment's truth surpasses thy deceit  Sister of Wisdom she of aspect mild  Who makes the golden mean her certain seat  And looks on casualty as nature's child  To heaven's behests still nobly reconcil'd  ODE ON TRUE GREATNESS  BY THE SAME  LET who will climb the towery steep  Of sovereignty with slippery strides  Where on the bosom of the deep  Below the pitchy pinnace rides  A death's head flag unfurl'd to view  Waves ghastly and a sable crew  Gaze from the deck and seem to wait  Dash'd down the pointed rocks the rash unfortunate  Mine be the low and level way  Amid the quiet vale to stray  Safe in some sylvan lodge to dwell  And lull'd by the clear stream that speeds  By shallow fords to rustling reeds  And small lakes fring'd with homely aspodel  There sits the calm the rural sage  With nature's volume fair in view  And meditates the shining page  Replete with wonders ever new  While Wisdom points on either hand  Where plants and herbs and flowrets stand  In emerald groves and shadowy glades  In furzy moors or muskysmelling meads  Truth in her liquid glass serene  To him explains each moral scene  Oft in the downward skies a train  Of tinsel insects he surveys  Or glowworm with fallacious blaze  Just emblem of court greatness srail and vain  Oft in his woodland walk he stops to mark  The spirited and youthful lark  Warn'd by the dawning in the dappled east  Lift his melodious flight thro' upper air  Late the low tenant of the rushy nest  Now sings unrival'd in his radiant sphere  The pondering hermit then sees Merit roam  Above the nurslings of the courtly dome  On Glory's sparkling wheels rais'd from its humble dom    First of the families of fame  That Rome's imperial city grace  From rural huts and hamlets came  The Fabian and Fabrician race  With that firm judge that could contemn  And banish the proud diadem  To Sabine fields she owes the vine  Whose tendrils yet round Virtue's column twine  Which braves Oppression's wintry breath  And stands the icy touch of Death  The leafless flock that Fortune dooms  To wither with returning spring  While the glad flocks of Freedom sing  Profuse of promis'd sweets with double vigour blooms  Hark hark 'tis Brutus' name I hear  Join'd with his fair heroic bride  To Honour's hallow'd fane they steer  Along the favourable tide  To her and Safety there to place  The tablet vow'd to human race  Blow every kind and gentle gale  Of gratitude and fan the swelling sail  High on a fleecy couch reclin'd  Of white and amber clouds combin'd  Rome's genius lifts his august head  Now slow descending nearer draws  Hail'd with the popular applause  And bids the solemn pageantry proceed  Go the triumphal ornaments display  Ye sacred Salii lead the way  Next led the order of Patrician blood  In awful march a numerous train compose  And follow'd by the jubilating crowd  As Cybelé thro' Phrygian cities goes  Majestic and with golden turrets crown'd  A hundred gods her gorgeous car surround  A thousand tongues acclaim the clanging cymbals sound  ODE TO CONCORD  BY THE SAME  SOUL of the world first mover say  From thee what glorious being came  Powerful to raise this universal frame  Who taught the ponderous wheels to play  Gave beauty to look forth with radiant eyes  And cloath'd with ambient day the chrystal skies  'Twas Concord who enthron'd above  With sevenfold adamantine chains  The path of wandering orbs restrains  Kindles the genial fire of love  And walks the courts of genuine light  While all heaven hails the wonders of her sight  Where Bliss has banish'd Chance and sore Annoy  And Goodness sills the cup of general joy  Nor is she to the heavens confin'd  Forth on the morning's wings she rides  She skims the glowing evening's purple tides  And leaves the setting sun behind  Where doves sit cooing at the noontide hour  And linnets warble in the woodbine bower  Where the pale moon her lustre spreads  The lovelorn bird divides her song  The soft flute sooths the rural throng  And dew drops load the flowrets' heads  Where the ingenuous chorus sings  The delicate touch flies o'er the trembling strings  From the gilt roof the symphony rebounds  Thine goddess are the charms and thine the silver sounds  The buxom air the saphire main  All height and depth confess thy gracious reign  But chief is thy delight to dwell  Lodg'd in the human breast thy dearest cell  Favour and friendship meet thee there  And tender transport with the gushing tear  There wedlock at thy altar bends  There halcyon peace securely broods  And meek tranquillity attends  To quell unruly rage and sooth the swelling floods  Now by the magic of thy tongue  That call'd up first the rolling spheres  Thro' the gay circle of revolving years  With rapturous sounds of mystic song  Attun'd in heavenly harmony to run  And by the virtue of th' enchanting zone  Which when the fair Idalian queen  Accepts with universal sway  The smiles and winning passions play  In her resistless look and mien  The loves thy heavenly gift admire  And tip their little darts with lambent fire  Fresh wreaths the graces bring and form the round  Where rising daisies mark the measur'd ground  Now by the rosy mildness sweet  Of which when youthful spring awakes  From thy abundance amply she partakes  What time the silkplum'd zephyrs meet  In Saba's groves to kiss the bending blooms  With balmy lips and wanton in perfumes  And by the ripened redolent grace  When summer in the Persian fields  To soberseeming Autumn yields  Her treasures on the loaded sprays  The skyrob'd plum the purple vine  The velvet peach and damask nectarine  While Plenty waving her Hesperian bough  Gladdens Pomona with the golden show  Great goddess with the words of peace  Bid this wild uproar of contention cease  Bid Amity with gentle ray  The woes that lowr on faction's brow display  Shall Rome to thee a rebel prove  For hellish hate abandon heavenly love  Here gentle Concord on each breast  Let thy springsweetness bland distil  Here thy ambrosial fragrance rest  And all mankind obey thy sovereign will  A FRAGMENT  BY MR MALLET  * * * * * * * * *  FAIR morn ascends soft zephyr's wing  O'er hill and vale renews the spring  Where sown profusely herb and flower  Of balmy smell of healing power  Their souls in fragrant dews exhale  And breathe fresh life in every gale  Here spreads a green expanse of plains  Where sweetlypensive Silence reigns  And there at utmost stretch of eye  A mountain fades into the sky  While winding round diffus'd and deep  A river rolls with sounding sweep  Of human art no traces near  I seem alone with Nature here  Here are thy walks O sacred Health  The monarch's bliss the beggar's wealth  The seasoning of all good below  The sovereign friend in joy or woe  O Thou most courted most despis'd  And but in absence duly priz'd  Power of the soft and rosy face  The vivid pulse the vermil grace  The spirits when they gayest shine  Youth beauty pleasure all are thine  O sun of life whose heavenly ray  Lights up and chears our various day  The turbulence of hopes and fears  The storm of fate the cloud of years  Till Nature with thy parting light  Reposes late in Death's calm night  Fled from the trophy'd roofs of state  Abodes of splendid pain and hate  Fled from the couch where in sweet sleep  Hot Riot would his anguish steep  But tosses thro' the midnight shade  Of death of life alike afraid  For ever fled to shady cell  Where Temperance where the Muses dwell  Thou oft art seen at early dawn  Slowpacing o'er the breezy lawn  Or on the brow of mountain high  In silence feasting ear and eye  With song and prospect which abound  From birds and woods and waters round  But when the sun with noontide ray  Flames forth intolerable day  While Heat sits fervent on the plain  With Thirst and Languor in his train  All nature sickening in the blaze  Thou in the wild and woody maze  That clouds the vale with umbrage deep  Impendent from the neighbouring steep  Wilt find betimes a calm retreat  Where breathing Coolness has her seat  There plung'd amid the shadows brown  Imagination lays him down  Attentive in his airy mood  To every murmur of the wood  The bee in yonder flowery nook  The chidings of the headlong brook  The green leaf shivering in the gale  The warbling hill the lowing vale  The distant woodman's echoing stroke  The thunder of the falling oak  From thought to thought in vision led  He holds high converse with the dead  Sages or Poets See they rife  And shadowy skim before his eyes  Hark Orpheus strikes the lyre again  That soften'd savages to men  Lo Socrates the Sent of heaven  To whom it's moral will was given  Fathers and friends of humankind  They form'd the nations or refin'd  With all that mends the head and heart  Enlightening truth adorning art  While thus I mus'd beneath the shade  At once the sounding breeze was laid  And Nature by the unknown law  Shook deep with reverential awe  Dumb silence grew upon the hour  A browner night involv'd the bower  When issuing from the inmost wood  Appear'd fair Freedom's Genius good  O Freedom sovereign boon of heaven  Great Charter with our being given  For which the patriot and the sage  Have pla  'd have bled

ADDRESSED TO THE EARL OF HARDWICKE HER FATHER  BY THE SAME  O CROWN'D with honor blest with length of days  Thou whom the wise revere the worthy praise  Just guardian of those laws thy voice explain'd  And meriting all titles thou hast gain'd  Tho' still the fairest from heaven's bounty flow  For good and great no monarch can bestow  Yet thus of health of fame of friends possest  No fortune Hardwicke is sincerely blest  All humankind are sons of sorrow born  The great must suffer and the good must mourn  For say can Wisdom's self what late was thine  Can Fortitude without a sigh resign  Ah no when Love when Reason hand in hand  O'er the cold urn consenting Mourners stand  The firmest heart dissolves to softness here  And Piety applauds the falling tear  Those sacred drops by virtuous weakness shed  Adorn the living while they grace the dead  From tender thought their source unblam'd they draw  By Heaven approv'd and true to Nature's law  When his lov'd Child the Roman could not save  Immortal Tully from an early grave  Tullia died about the age of two and thirty She is celebrated for her filial piety and for having added to the usual graces of her sex the more solid accomplishments of knowledge and polite letters    No common forms his homefelt passion kept  The sage the patriot in the parent wept  And O by grief ally'd as join'd in fame  The same thy loss thy sorrows are the same  She whom the Muses whom the Loves deplore  Even she thy pride and pleasure is no more  In bloom of years in all her virtue's bloom  Lost to thy hopes and silent in the tomb  O Season mark'd by mourning and despair  Thy blasts how fatal to the young and fair  For vernal freshness for the balmy breeze  Thy tainted winds came pregnant with disease  Sick Nature sunk before the mortal breath  That scatter'd fever agony and death  What funerals has thy cruel ravage spread  What eyes have flow'd what noble bosoms bled  Here let Reflection fix her sober view  O think who suffer and who sigh with you  See rudely snatch'd in all her pride of charms  Bright Granby from a youthful husband's arms  In climes far distant see that husband mourn  His arms revers'd his recent laurel torn  Behold again at Fate's imperious call  In one dread instant blooming Lincoln fall  See her iov'd Lord with speechless anguish bend  And mixing tears with his thy noblest friend  Thy Pelham turn

retreat of Health and Peace  An humble cottage stood  There beauteous Emma flourish'd fair  Beneath a mother's eye  Whose only wish on earth was now  To see her blest and die  The softest blush that Nature spreads  Gave colour to her cheek  Such orient colour smiles thro' heaven  When vernal mornings break  Nor let the pride of great ones scorn  This charmer of the plains  That sun who bids their diamond blaze  To paint our lilly deigns  Long had she fill'd each youth with love  Each maiden with despair  And tho' by all a wonder own'd  Yet knew not she was fair  Till Edwin came the pride of swains  A soul devoid of art  And from whose eye serenely mild  Shone forth the feeling heart  A mutual flame was quickly caught  Was quickly too reveal'd  For neither bosom lodg'd a wish  That virtue keeps conceal'd  What happy hours of homeselt bliss  Did love on both bestow  But bliss too mighty long to last  Where fortune proves a foe  His sister who like Envy form'd  Like her in mischief joy'd  To work them harm with wicked skill  Each darker art employ'd  The Father too a sordid man  Who love nor pity knew  Was all unfeeling as the clod  From whence his riches grew  Long had he seen their secret flame  And seen it long unmov'd  Then with a father's frown at last  Had sternly disapprov'd  In Edwin's gentle heart a war  Of differing passions strove  His heart that durst not disobey  Yet could not cease to love  Deny'd her sight he oft behind  The spreading hawthorn crept  To snatch a glance to mark the spot  Where Emma walk'd and wept  Oft too on Stanemore's wintry waste  Beneath the moonlight shade  In fighs to pour his soften'd soul  The midnight mourner stray'd  His cheek where health with beauty glow'd  A deadly pale o'ercast  So fades the fresh rose in its prime  Before the northern blast  The parents now with late remorse  Hung o'er his dying bed  And weary'd heaven with fruitless vows  And fruitless sorrow shed  'Tis past he cry'dbut if your souls  Sweet mercy yet can move  Let these dim eyes once more behold  What they must ever love  She came his cold hand softly touch'd  And bath'd with many a tear  Fastfalling o'er the primrose pale  So morning dews appear  But oh his sister's jealous care  A cruel sister she  Forbade what Emma came to say  " My Edwin live for me"  Now homeward as she hopeless wept  The churchyard path along  The blast blew cold the dark owl scream'd  Her lover's funeral song  Amid the falling gloom of night  Her startling fancy found  In every bush his hovering shade  His groan in every sound  Alone appall'd thus had she past  The visionary vale  When lo the deathbell smote her ear  Sad sounding in the gale  Just then she reach'd with trembling step  Her aged mother's door  He's gone she cry'd and I shall see  That angelface no more  I feel I feel this breaking heart  Beat high against my side  From her white arm down sunk her head  She shivering sigh'd and died  AN ELEGY ON A PILE OF RUINS  BY J CUNNINGHAM  IN the full prospect yonder hill commands  O'er forests fields and vernalcoated plains  The vestige of an ancient abbey stands  Close by a ruin'd castle's rude remains  Half buried there lie many a broken bust  And obelisk and urn o'erthrown by time  And many a cherub here descends in dust  From the rent roof and portico sublime  The rivulets oft frighted at the sound  Of fragments tumbling from the towers on high  Plunge to their source in secret caves profound  Leaving their banks and pebbly bottoms dry  Where reverend shrines in gothic grandeur stood  The nettle or the noxious nightshade spreads  And ashlings wafted from the neighbouring wood  Thro' the worn turrets wave their trembling heads  There Contemplation to the crowd unknown  Her attitude compos'd and aspect sweet  Sits musing on a monumental stone  And points to the memento at her feet  Soon as sage evening check'd day's sunny pride  I left the mantling shade in moral mood  And seated by the maid's sequester'd side  Thus sigh'd the mouldering ruins as I view'd  Inexorably calm with silent pace  Here Time has pass'dWhat ruin marks his way  This pile now crumbling o'er its hallow'd base  Turn'd not his step nor could his course delay  Religion rais'd her supplicating eyes  In vain and Melody her song sublime  In vain Philosophy with maxims wise  Would touch the cold unfeeling heart of Time  Yet the hoar tyrant tho' not mov'd to spare  Relented when he struck its finish'd pride  And partly the rude ravage to repair  The tottering towers with twisted ivy tied  How solemn is the cell o'ergrown with moss  That terminates the view yon cloister'd way  In the crush'd wall a timecorroded cross  Religion like stands mouldering in decay  Where the mild sun thro' saintencypher'd glass  Illum'd with mellow light that brownbrow'd isle  Many rapt hours might Meditation pass  Slow moving 'twixt the pillars of the pile  And Piety with mysticmeaning beads  Bowing to saints on every side inurn'd  Trod oft the solitary path that leads  Where now the sacred altar lies o'erturn'd  Thro' the grey grove betwixt those withering trees  'Mongst a rude group of monuments appears  A marbleimag'd matron on her knees  Half wasted like a Niobe in tears  Low levell'd in the dust her darling's laid  Death pitied not the pride of youthful bloom  Nor could maternal piety dissuade  Or soften the fell tyrant of the tomb  The relicks of a mitred saint may rest  Where mouldering in the nich his statue stand  Now nameless as the crowd that kiss'd his vest  And crav'd the benediction of his hands  Near the brown arch redoubling yonder gloom  The bones of an illustrious chieftain lie  As trac'd upon the timeunletter'd tomb  The trophies of a broken fame imply  Ah what avails that o'er the vassal plain  His rights and rich demesnes extended wide  That honour and her knights compos'd his train  And chivalry stood marshall'd by his side  Tho' to the clouds his castle seem'd to climb  And frown'd defiance on the desperate foe  Tho' deem'd invincible the conqueror Time  Levell'd the fabric as the founder low  Where the light lyre gave many a softening sound  Ravens and rooks the birds of discord dwell  And where society sat sweetly crown'd  Eternal solitude has fix'd her cell  The lizard and the lazy lurking bat  Inhabit now perhaps the painted room  Where the sage matron and her maidens sat  Sweetsinging at the silverworking loom  The traveller's bewilder'd on a waste  And the rude winds incessant seem to roar  Where in his groves with arching arbours grac'd  Young lovers often sigh'd in days of yore  His aqueducts that led the limpid tide  To pure canals a crystal cool supply  In the deep dust their barren beauties hide  Time's thirst unquenchable has drain'd them dry  Tho' his rich hours in revelry were spent  With Comus and the laughterloving crew  And the sweet brow of beauty still unbent  Brighten'd his fleecy moments as they flew  Fleet are the fleecy moments fly they must  Not to be stay'd by masque or midnight roar  Nor shall a pulse amongst that mouldering dust  Beat wanton at the smiles of beauty more  Can the deep statesman skill'd in great design  Protract but for a day precarious breath  Or the tun'd follower of the sacred nine  Soothe with his melody insatiate Death  Notho' the palace bar her golden gate  Or monarchs plant ten thousand guards around  Unerring and unseen the shaft of fate  Strikes the devoted victim to the ground  What then avails ambition's widestretch'd wing  The schoolman's page or pride of beauty's bloom  The crapeclad hermit and the richrob'd king  Levell'd lie mix'd promiscuous in the tomb  The Macedonian monarch wise and good  Bade when the morning's rosy reign began  Courtiers should call as round his couch they stood  " Philip remember thou'rt no more than man  " Tho' glory spread thy name from pole to pole  " Tho' thou art merciful and brave and just  " Philip reflect thou'rt posting to the goal  " Where mortals mix in undistinguish'd dust"  So Saladin for arts and arms renown'd  Aegypt and Syria's wide domains subdued  Returning with imperial triumphs crown'd  Sigh'd when the perishable pomp he view'd  And as he rode high in his regal car  In all the purple pride of conquest drest  Conspicuous o'er the trophies gain'd in war  Plac'd pendent on a spear his burial vest  While thus the herald cried"This son of power  " This Saladin to whom the nations bow'd  " May in the space of one revolving hour  " Boast of no other spoil but yonder shroud"  Search where Ambition rag'd with rigour steel'd  Where Slaughter like the rapid lightning ran  And say while Memory weeps the bloodstain'd field  Where lies the chief and where the common man  Vain are the pyramids and motto'd stones  And monumental trophies rais'd on high  For time confounds them with the crumbling bones  That mix'd in hasty graves unnotic'd lie  Rests not beneath the turf the peasant's head  Soft as the lord's beneath the labour'd tomb  Or sleeps one colder in his close clay bed  Than t'other in the wide vault's dreary womb  Hither let Luxury lead her looserob'd train  Here flutter Pride on purple painted wings  And from the moral prospect learnhow vain  The wish that sighs for sublunary things  ODE TO SLEEP  BY MR H  I  FRIEND to the gloomy shade of night  Vast source of fanciful delight  Power whose

remembrance of each parting sigh  Of beauty's smile or pity's streaming eye  In grief's soft moments steal around his asking breast  III  Fair virtue's friend thou ne'er shalt shed  Thy blessings o'er

audience of which the Chorus of Furies in his Eumenides is a remarkable and well known instance He was buried near the river Gela where the tragedians performed dramas at his tomb  Father of the Grecian stage  In terror clad annoys my rest  I feel unnumber'd horrors rise  The sight forsakes my swimming eyes  While hissing furies rush upon my breast  In solemn pomp I see old Gela mourn  Dissolv'd in grief beside the poet's grave  To sorrowing sounds he lulls each plaintive wave  His willows fading and his seagreen mantle torn  VII  With longing taste with eager lip  In raptur'd visions oft I sip  The honeys of the tragic  Sophocles who it is said was able to check the fury of the winds and sea Philostratus de Vita Apollonii Tyanei lib viii pag  bee  Whose strains could every

make  Form'd thee to every sense awake  Blithe hope or frantic fear  Can human miseries steal a sigh  Or from thy soft consenting eye  Can pity draw the tear  VII  Canst thou with wild Othello glow  In all his maddening jealous woe  By Love's dark doubts distrest  With treacherous Jaffier dost thou feel  Th' impending tortures of the wheel  That wound his guilty breast  VIII  Tell me can Pindar's lofty strain  Luxuriant Fancy's fruitful vein  The noblest thoughts infuse  Say do you taste his generous fire  Or canst thou feelingly expire  To Sappho's plaintive muse  IX  See'st thou the warmth the grace divine  That breathes thro' mild Correggio's line  By heaven's peculiar care  Does Guido wrap thee in delight  Can Titian's colours charm thy sight  Or Julio's godlike air  X  Say does thy heart with rapture spring  When Handel strikes the magic string  With transport do you hear  Or dost thou languish into pain  When soft Corelli's tender strain  Subdues the ravish'd ear  XI  Canst

Should Hope her lenient aid refuse  Tho' each disasterous day renews  One sadden'd scene of woe  From pleasing symphony of sound  When melting notes dissolve around  Unnumber'd raptures flow  XV  Music her sister arts may aid  And Poetry o'er light and shade  Reflect her mutual fire  Meek suppliants all at Beauty's shrine  In one united there shall join  The Pencil Muse and Lyre  ODE TO TASTE

friends who solemn stalk  And haunt me in my midnight walk  While wild winds blustering round my head  Inspire me with poetic dread  Thro' closing shades o'er valleys green  May'st thou still solemnize the scene  And as the storms innoxious roll  Pour thy lov'd horrors o'er my soul  Yet not alone Britannia's shore  Thy fatal absence shall deplore  See old Achaia's genius mourn  His bosom bare his garments torn  See his generous patriot breast  By all his country's wrongs opprest  See him with haughty fix'd disdain  Lament his dastard sons in vain  To fairer happier climes belong  The

the Romans under the conduct of Paulus Aemilius in the second Macedonian war entirely subdued Greece and led Persius king of Macedon in triumph It was not till after this victory that the Romans had any taste for the fine arts  Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit artes  Intulit agresti Latio c  Horace Epist I Lib ii  And lo again in conquering Rome  With all their usual vigour bloom  Again they

Godegisil king of the Vandals    Once more the Arts began to spread  Once more gay Science rear'd her head  Alas in vain she strove t' assuage  The enthusiast zealot's bigot rage  Pope Gregory who

Raphael charm the heart  Shall never Nature yield to Art  Shall never Maro's beauties shine  Except in Armstrong's classic line  And does no Leo now remain  Who yet shall chear thy drooping train  There are who still thy aid implore  Who still thy sovereign power adore  Thy relicts with religious fear  Fond Italy shall yet revere  Sweet power in simple pomp array'd  Be all thy native charms

To melancholy vaults repair  With aching sicken'd cold review  Bid every sorrow stream anew  Here may'st thou weep thy favourite Rome  Sadsighing o'er each martyr's tomb  The Catacombs at Goodwood Those in the Via Appia near Rome are generally supposed to be caves where the primitive christians concealed themselves from their persecutors and interred those who were martyrs for their religion Mr Wright in his Travels through Italy vol i pag acquaints us that at the mouth of some of the niches were to be seen small vials like lachrymatories tinged with red which they esteemed an indication that the bodies of martyrs were deposited there    Meek Pity Attic maid shall join  Her tender social tears with thine  O'er every urn fresh laurels strow  And fondly emulate thy woe  Or would'st thou

 Where Learning's laurel never grew  Where Nature to our wondering eyes  Each salutary herb supplies  Where flowers their fragrant sweets diffuse  Where trees distil their kindly dews  And blest with every power to heal  Soft slumbers o'er the senses steal  In such enchanting artless scenes  'Mid bowery mazes spreading greens  Sooth'd by the breezy western gale  In scented grove or rocky dale  Or

high alcove  Each Indian wooes his favourite mate  What Nature dictates they relate  No youths by love's cold arts are won  Nor maids by easy faith undone  With eye uprais'd the simple swain  Dreads

America is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the east by the Atlantic    Or snatch thee to some waveworn shore  Where fierce Atlantic surges roar  Where Plata with resistless force

is a noted cavern in Somersetshire which has given birth to as many wild fanciful stories as the Sybils cave in Italy Through a very narrow entrance it opens into a large vault the roof whereof either on account of its height or the thickness of the gloom cannot be discovered by the light of torches It goes winding a great way underground is crost by a stream of very cold water and is all horrid with broken pieces of rock many of these are evident petrifactions which on account of their singular forms have given rise to the fables alluded to in this poem    IN aunciente days tradition shows  A sorry wicked elf arose  The witch of Wokey hight  A petrifaction in the cavern of Wokey so called    Oft have I heard the fearful tale  From Sue and Roger of the vale  Told out in winter night  Deep in the dreary dismal cell  Which seem'd and was ycleped hell  This blueeye'd hag was sty'd  Nine wicked elves have legends sayne  By night she chose her guardian train  All kennell'd close her side  Here screeching owls oft made their nest  While wolves its craggy sides possest  Night howling through the rocks  No wholesome herb cou'd here be found  She blasted every plant around  And blister'd o'er the flocks  Her haggard face so foul to see  Her mouth unmeet a mouth to be  With eyne of deadly leer  She nought devis'd but neighbours ill  On all she wreak'd her wayward will  And marr'd all goodly cheer  All in her prime have poets sunge  No gaudy youth gallante and younge  Ere blest her longing arms  Hence rose her fell despight to vex  And blast the youth of either sex  By dint of hellish charms  From Glaston came a lerned wight  Full bent to marr her fell despight  And well he did I ween  Save hers sich mischief ne'er was knowne  And since his mickle lerninge showne  Sich mischief ne'er has beene  He chauntede out his godlie booke  He cross'd the water bleste the brooke  ThenPaternoster done  The gastly hag he sprinkled o'er  When lo where stood the hag before  Now stood a gastly stone  Full well 'tis knowne adown the vale  Tho' strange may seem the dismal tale  Eke wondrous may appear  I'm bold to say theres never one  That has not seen the witch in stone  With all her household gear  But tho' this lernede clerke did well  With grieved heart alas I tell  She left this curse behind  " My sex shall be forsaken quite"  " Tho' sense and beauty both unite"  " Nor find a man that's kinde"  Now lo e'en as this fiend did say  The sex have found it to this day  That men are wondrous scante  Here's beauty wit and sense combin'd  With all that's good and virtuous join'd  Yet scarce there's one gallante  Shall such fair nymphs thus daily moan  They might I trow as well be stone  As thus forsaken dwell  Since Glaston now can boast no clerks  From Oxenford come down ye sparks  And help revoke the spell  Yet staynor thus despond ye fair  Virtue's the gods peculiar care  Then mark their kindly voice  " Your sex shall soon be blest again"  " We only wait to find sich men"  " As best deserve sich choice"  THE IGNORANCE OF MAN  BY JAMES MERRICK M A  BEHOLD yon newborn infant griev'd  With hunger thirst and pain  That asks to have the wants reliev'd  It knows not to explain  Aloud the speechless suppliant cries  And utters as it can  The woes that in its bosom rise  And speak its nature Man  That infant whose advancing hour  Life's various sorrows try  Sad proof of sin's transmissive power  That infant Lord am I  A childhood yet my thoughts confess  Tho' long in years mature  Unknowing whence I feel distress  And where or what its cure  Author of good to thee I turn  Thy ever wakeful eye  Alone can all my wants discern  Thy hand alone supply  O let thy fear within me dwell  Thy love my footsteps guide  That love shall vainer loves expel  That fear all fears beside  And O by error's force subdu'd  Since oft my stubborn will  Preposterous shuns the latent good  And grafps the specious ill  Not to my wish but to my want  Do thou thy gifts apply  Unask'd what good thou knowest grant  What ill tho' ask'd deny  THE TRIALS OF VIRTUE  BY THE SAME  PLac'd on the verge of Youth my mind  Life's opening scene survey'd  I view'd its hills of various kind  Afflicted and afraid  But chief my fear the dangers mov'd  That Virtue's path inclose  My heart the wise pursuit approv'd  But O what toils oppose  For see ah see while yet her ways  With doubtful step I tread  A hostile World its terrors raise  Its snares delusive spread  O how shall I with heart prepar'd  Those terrors learn to meet  How from the thousand snares to guard  My unexperienc'd feet  As thus I mus'd oppresive Sleep  Soft o'er my temples drew  Oblivion's veil The watry Deep  An object strange and new  Before me rose on the wide shore  Observant as I stood  The gathering storms around me roar  And heave the boiling flood  Near and more near the billows rise  Ev'n now my steps they lave  And Death to my affrighted eyes  Approach'd in every wave  What hope or whither to retreat  Each nerve at once unstrung  Chill Fear had fetter'd fast my feet  And chain'd my speechless tongue  I feel my heart within me die  When sudden to mine ear  A voice descending from on high  Reprov'd my erring fear  " What tho' the swelling surge thou see  " Impatient to devour  " Rest Mortal rest on God's decree  " And thankful own his power  " Know when he bade the Deep appear  " Thus far th' Almignty said  " Thus far nor farther rage and Here  " Let thy proud waves be stay'd  I heard and lo at once controul'd  The waves in wild retreat  Back on themselves reluctant roll'd  And murm'ring left my feet  Deeps to assembling Deeps in vain  Once more the signal gave  The shores the rushing weight sustain  And check th' usurping wave  Convinc'd in Nature's volume wise  The imag'd truth I read  And sudden from my waking eyes  Th' instructive Vision fled  Then why thus heavy O my Soul  Say why distrustful still  Thy thoughts with vain impatience roll  O'er scenes of future ill  Let Faith suppress each rising fear  Each anxious doubt exclude  Thy Maker's will has plac'd thee here  A Maker wise and good  He to thy every trial knows  Its just restraint to give  Attentive to behold thy woes  And faithful to relieve  Then why thus heavy O my Soul  Say why distrustful still  Thy thoughts with vain impatience roll  O'er scenes of future ill  Tho' griefs unnumber'd throng thee round  Still in thy God confide  Whose singer marks the Seas their bound  And curbs the headlong Tide  VERSES WRITTEN ORIGINALLY IN THE PERSIC LANGUAGE  BY THE SAME  IF mortal hands thy peace destroy  Or friendship's gifts bestow  Wilt thou to Man ascribe thy joy  To Man impute thy woe  'Tis God whose thoughts to various ends  The human lot dispose  Around thee plant assisting friends  Or heap avenging Foes  Not from the Bow the deaths proceed  But from the Archer's skill  Who lends the thirsty shaft its speed  And gives it strength to kill  A HYMN  BY THE SAME  PART I  GOD of my health whose tender care  First gave me power to move  How shall my thankful heart declare  The wonders of thy love  While void of thought and sense I lay  Dust of my parent Earth  Thy breath inform'd the sleeping clay  And call'd me to the birth  From Thee the parts their fashion took  E'er life was yet begun  And in the volume of thy Book  Were written one by one  Thine eye beheld in open view  The yet unfinish'd plan  The portrait lines thy pencil drew  And form'd the future Man  O may this frame that rising grew  Beneath thy plastic hands  Be studious ever to pursue  Whate'er thy Will commands  The Soul that moves this earthly load  Thy semblance let it bear  Nor lose the traces of the God  Who stamp'd his image there  PART II  THOU who within this earthly shrine  Hast pour'd thy quick'ning ray  O let thine influence on me shine  And purge each mist away  With curious search let others ask  Thro' Nature's depths to see  O teach my soul the better task  To know itself and Thee  Teach me to know how weak the mind  That yields to erring pride  And let my doubting Reason find  Thy Word its safest guide  Let me not lost in Learning's maze  Religion's flame resign  For what's the worth of human praise  Compar'd my God to Thine  Keep in my soul the strong delight  The hopes that in me rise  While Faith presents before my sight  The bliss that never dies  O be those Hopes my only boast  That Faith my whole employ  Till Faith in Knowledge shall be lost  And Hope in fullest Joy  PART III  WHEREE'ER I turn my wakeful thought  Unnumber'd foes I see  Guide of my youth forsake me not  But lead me safe to Thee  As on I press Distrust and Doubt  Dissuasive step between  While Pleasures tempt me from without  And Passions war within  Yet fix'd on Thee I lose each fear  Each vain assault I brave  I know Thee Lord nor slow to hear  Nor impotent to save  O cast my errors from thy sight  And let them pass away  Unheeded as a watch by night  Or as a cloud by day  So while in secret thought arraign'd  O'er my past life I go  And mark how oft I urg'd thy hand  To strike th' avenging blow  So oft shall my repeated lays  My thankful heart declare  And joy to celebrate thy praise  Whose Mercy deign'd to spare  THE LORD'S PRAYER PARAPHRASED  BY THE SAME  FATHER of all whose seat of rest  In highest heaven is rear'd  Thy name by every tongue be blest  By every heart rever'd  Let earth to thy Messiah's throne  Its just subjection yield  Here as in heaven thy will be known  Here as in heaven fulfill'd  With bread sufficient to the day  Our mortal frame supply  And feed the soul that moves our clay  With manna from on high  While conscious of the debt we owe  We bow the humble knee  That mercy we to others shew  Descend on us from Thee  Do Thou our erring feet secure  O lead us far from ill  And keep us upright just and pure  In act in word and will  Hear Lord for power supreme is thine  Thine glory worship praise  Nor Nature's bounds thy reign confine  Nor numbers Time thy days  AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND IN TOWN  BY MR DYER  HAVE my friends in the town in the gay busy town  Forgot such a man as John Dyer  Or heedless despise they or pity the clown  Whose bosom no pageantries fire  No matter no mattercontent in the shades  Contentedwhy every thing charms me  Fall in tunes all adown the green steep ye cascades  Till hence rigid virtue alarms me  Till outrage arises or misery needs  The swift the intrepid avenger  Till sacred religion or liberty bleeds  Then mine be the deed and the danger  Alas what a folly that wealth and domain  We heap up in sin and in sorrow  Immense is the toil yet the labour how vain  Is not life to be over tomorrow  Then glide on my moments the few that I have  Smoothshaded and quiet and even  While gently the body descends to the grave  And the spirit arises to heaven  ODE TO MELANCHOLY  BY MISS CARTER  COME Melancholy silent power  Companion of my lonely hour  To sober thought confin'd  Thou sweetly sad ideal guest  In all thy soothing charms confest  Indulge my pensive mind  No longer wildly hurried thro'  The tides of mirth that ebb and flow  In folly's noisy stream  I from the busy crowd retire  To court the objects that inspire  Thy philosophic dream  Thro' yon dark grove of mournful yews  With solitary steps I muse  By thy direction led  Here cold to pleasure's tempting forms  Consociate with my sisterworms  And mingle with the dead  Ye midnight horrors awful gloom  Ye silent regions of the tomb  My future peaceful bed  Here shall my weary eyes be clos'd  And every sorrow lie repos'd  In death's refreshing shade  Ye pale inhabitants of night  Before my intellectual sight  In solemn pomp ascend  O tell how trifling now appears  The train of idle hopes and fears  That varying life attend  Ye faithless idols of our sense  Here own how vain your fond pretence  Ye empty names of joy  Your transient forms like shadows pass  Frail offspring of the magic glass  Before the mental eye  The dazzling colours falsely bright  Attract the gazing vulgar sight  With superficial state  Thro' Reason's clearer optics view'd  How stript of all it's pomp how rude  Appears the painted cheat  Can wild Ambition's tyrant power  Or illgot Wealth's superfluous store  The dread of death controul  Can Pleasure's more bewitching charms  Avert or soothe the dire alarms  That shake the parting soul  Religion e'er the hand of Fate  Shall make Reflexion plead too late  My erring senses teach  Amidst the flattering hopes of youth  To meditate the solemn truth  These awful relics preach  Thy penetrating beams disperse  The mist of error whence our fears  Derive their fatal spring  'Tis thine the trembling heart to warm  And soften to an angel form  The pale terrific king  When sunk by guilt in sad despair  Repentance breathes her humble prayer  And owns thy threatnings just  Thy voice the shuddering suppliant chears  With Mercy calms her torturing fears  And lifts her from the dust  Sublim'd by thee the soul aspires  Beyond the range of low desires  In nobler views elate  Unmov'd her destin'd change surveys  And arm'd by faith intrepid pays  The universal debt  In Death's soft slumber lull'd to rest  She sleeps by smiling visions blest  That gently whisper Peace  Till the last morn's fair opening ray  Unfolds the bright eternal day  Of active life and bliss  ODE  BY THE SAME  WITH restless agitations toss'd  And low immers'd in woes  When shall my wild distemper'd thoughts  Regain their lost repose  Beneath the deep oppressive gloom  My languid spirits fade  And all the drooping powers of life  Decline to death's cold shade  O Thou the wretched's sure retreat  These torturing cares controul  And with the chearful smile of peace  Revive my fainting soul  Did ever thy relenting ear  The humble plea disdain  Or when did plaintive Misery sigh  Or supplicate in vain  Opprest with grief and shame dissolv'd  In penitential tears  Thy goodness calms our restless doubts  And dissipates our fears  New life from thy refreshing grace  Our sinking hearts receive  Thy gentle best lov'd attribute  To pity and forgive  From that blest source propitious Hope  Appears serenely bright  And sheds her soft diffufive beam  O'er Sorrow's dismal night  Dispers'd by her superior force  The sullen shades retire  And opening gleams of newborn joy  The conscious soul inspire  My griefs confess her vital power  And bless the friendly ray  Fair Phosphor to the smiling morn  Of everlasting day  WRITTEN AT MIDNIGHT IN A THUNDER STORM  BY THE SAME  LET coward Guilt with pallid Fear  To sheltering caverns fly  And justly dread the vengeful Fate  That thunders thro' the sky  Protected by that hand whose law  The threatening storms obey  Intrepid Virtue smiles secure  As in the blaze of day  In the thick clouds tremendous gloom  The lightnings lurid glare  It views the same allgracious power  That breathes the vernal air  Thro' Nature's evervarying scene  By different ways pursued  The one eternal end of heaven  Is universal good  With like beneficent effect  O'er flaming Aether glows  As when it tunes the linnet's voice  Or blushes in the rose  By Reason taught to scorn those fear  That vulgar minds molest  Let no fantastic terrors break  My dear Narcissa's rest  Thy life may all the tenderest care  Of Providence defend  And delegated angels round  Their guardian wings extend  When thro' creation's vast expanse  The last dread thunders roll  Untune the concord of the spheres  And shake the rising soul  Unmov'd may'st thou the final storm  Of jarring worlds survey  That ushers in the glad serene  Of everlasting day  TO  BY THE SAME  HOW sweet the calm of this sequester'd shore  Where ebbing waters musically roll  And Solitude and silent Eve restore  The philosophic temper of the soul  The sighing gale whose murmurs lull to rest  The busy tumult of declining day  To sympathetic quiet soothes the breast  And every wild emotion dies away  Farewell the objects of diurnal care  Your task be ended with the setting sun  Let all be undisturb'd vacation here  While o'er yon wave ascends the peaceful Moon  What beauteous visions o'er the soften'd heart  In this still moment all their charms diffuse  Serener joys and brighter hopes impart  And chear the soul with more than mortal views  Here faithful Memory wakens all her powers  She bids her fair ideal forms ascend  And quick to every gladden'd thought restores  The social virtue and the absent friend  Come ******* come and with me share  The sober pleasures of this solemn scene  While no rude tempest clouds the ruffled air  But all like thee is smiling and serene  Come while the cool the solitary hours  Each foolish care and giddy wish controul  With all thy soft persuasion's wonted powers  Beyond the stars transport my listening soul  Oft when on earth detain'd by empty show  Thy voice has taught the tri  er how to rise  Taught her to look with scorn on things below  And seek her better portion in the skies  Come and the sacred eloquence repeat  The world shall vanish at its gentle sound  Angelic forms shall visit this retreat  And opening heaven diffuse its glories round  WRITTEN EXTEMPORE ON THE SEA SHORE  BY THE SAME  THOU restless fluctuating deep  Expressive of the human mind  In thy for ever varying form  My own inconstant self I find  How soft now flow thy peaceful waves  In just gradations to the shore  While on thy brow unclouded shines  The regent of the midnight hour  Blest emblem of that equal state  Which I this moment feel within  Where thought to thought succeeding rolls  And all is placid and serene  As o'er thy smoothly flowing tide  Their light the trembling moonbeams dart  My lov'd Eudocia's image smiles  And gaily brightens all my heart  But ah this flattering scene of peace  By neither can be long possest  When Eurus breaks thy transient calm  And rising sorrows shake my breast  Obscur'd thy Cynthia's silver ray  When clouds opposing intervene  And every joy that Friendship gives  Shall fade beneath the gloom of Spleen  TO MRS  BY THE SAME  WHERE are those hours on rosy pinions borne  Which brought to every guiltless with success  When Pleasure gladden'd each returning morn  And every evening clos'd in calms of peace  How smil'd each object when by Friendship led  Thro' flowery paths we wander'd unconfin'd  Enjoy'd each airy hill or solemn shade  And left the bustling empty world behind  With philosophic social sense survey'd  The noonday sky in brighter colours shone  And softer o'er the dewy landscape play'd  The peaceful radiance of the silent moon  Those hours are vanish'd with the changing year  And dark December clouds the summer scene  Perhaps alas for ever vanish'd here  No more to bless distinguish'd life again  Yet not like those by thoughtless Folly drown'd  In blank Oblivion's sullen stagnant deep  Where never more to pass their fated bound  The ruins of neglected Being sleep  But lasting traces mark the happier hours  Which active zeal in life's great task employs  Which Science from the waste of Time secures  Or various Fancy gratefully enjoys  O still be ours to each improvement given  Which Friendship doubly to the heart endears  Those hours when banish'd hence shall fly to heaven  And claim the promise of eternal years  TO OCCASIONED BY AN ODE WRITTEN BY MRS PHILIPS  BY THE SAME  NARCISSA still thro' every varying name  My constant care and bright enlivening theme  In what soft language shall the Muse declare  The fond extravagance of love sincere  How all those pleasing sentiments convey  That charm my fancy when I think on thee  A theme like this Orinda's thoughts inspir'd  Nor less by Friendship than by Genius fir'd  Then let her happier more persuasive art  Explain th' agreeing dictates of my heart  Sweet may her fame to late remembrance bloom  And everlasting laurels shade her tomb  Whose spotless verse with genuine force exprest  The brightest passion of the human breast  In what blest clime beneath what favouring skies  Did thy fair form propitious Friendship rise  With mystic sense the poet's tuneful tongue  There were two Venuses among the ancients one called Pandemus to whom they attributed the love of wild disorderly pleasures the other named Urania the patroness and inspirer of Friendship Knowledge and Virtue  Urania's birth in glittering fiction sung  That Paphos first her smiling presence own'd  Which wide diffus'd its happy influence round  With hands united and with looks serene  Th' attending graces hail'd their newborn queen  The zephyrs round her wav'd their purple wing  And shed the fragrance of the breathing spring  The rosy hours advanc'd in silent slight  Led sparkling youth and ever new delight  Soft sigh the winds the waters gently roll  A purer azure vests the lucid pole  All nature welcom'd in the beauteous train  And heaven and earth smil'd conscious of the scene  But long ere Paphos rose or poet sung  In heavenly breasts the sacred passion sprung  The same bright flames in raptur'd seraphs glow  As warm consenting tempers here below  While one attraction Mortal Angel binds  Virtue which forms the unison of minds  Friendship her soft harmonious touch affords  And gently strikes the sympathetic chords  Th' agreeing notes in social measures roll  And the sweet concert flows from soul to soul  By heaven's enthusiastic impulse taught  What shining visions rose on Plato's thought  While by the Muses gently winding flood  Ilyssus a river near Athens dedicated to the Muses On the banks of this river under a plantane Plato lays the scene of some of his dialogues on love and beauty    His s arching fancy trac'd the sovereign good  The laurell'd sisters touch'd the vocal lyre  And wisdom's goddess led their tuneful choir  Beneath the genial Plantane's spreading shade  How sweet the philosophic music play'd  Thro' all the grove along the flowery shore  The charming sounds responsive echoes bore  Here from the cares of vulgar life refin'd  Immortal pleasures open'd on his mind  In gay succession to his ravish'd eyes  The animating powers of Beauty rise  On every object round above below  Quick to the sight her vivid colours glow  Yet not to matter's shadowy forms confin'd  The fair and good he sought remain'd behind  Till gradual rising thro' the boundless whole  He view'd the blooming graces of the soul  Where to the beam of intellectual day  The genuine charms of moral beauty play  With pleasing force the strong attractions move  Each finer sense and tune it into love  A NIGHTPIECE  BY THE SAME  WHILE Night in solemn shade invests the pole  And calm Reflexion soothes the pensive soul  While Reason undisturb'd asserts her sway  And Life's deceitful colours fade away  To thee allconscious presence I devote  This peaceful interval of sober thought  Here all my better faculties confine  And be this hour of sacred silence thine  If by the day's illusive scenes misled  My erring soul from Virtue's path has stray'd  Snar'd by example or by passion warm'd  Some false delight my giddy sense has charm'd  My calmer thoughts the wretched choice reprove  And my best hopes are center'd in thy love  Depriv'd of this can life one joy afford  Its utmost boast a vain unmeaning word  But ah how oft my lawless passions rove  And break those awful precepts I approve  Pursue the fatal impulse I abhor  And violate the Virtue I adore  Oft' when thy better spirit's guardian care  Warm'd my fond soul to shun the tempting snare  My stubborn Will his gentle aid represt  And check'd the rising Goodness in my breast  Mad with vain hopes or urg'd by false desires  Still'd his soft voice and quench'd his sacred fires  With grief opprest and prostrate in the dust  Shouldst thou condemn I own the sentence just  But oh thy softer titles let me claim  And plead my cause by Mercy's gentle name  Mercy that wipes the penitential tear  And dissipates the horrors of Despair  From rigorous Justice steals the vengeful hour  Softens the dreadful attribute of Power  Disarms the wrath of an offended God  And seals my pardon in a Saviour's blood  Allpowerful Grace exert thy gentle sway  And teach my rebel passions to obey  Lest lurking Folly with insidious art  Regain my volatile inconstant heart  Shall every high resolve Devotion frames  Be only lifeless sounds and specious names  O rather while thy hopes and fears controul  In this still hour each motion of my soul  Secure its safety by a sudden doom  And be the soft retreat of Sleep my tomb  Calm let me slumber in that dark repose  Till the last morn its orient beam disclose  Then when the great Archangel's potent sound  Shall echo thro' Creation's ample round  Wak'd from the sleep of death with joy survey  The opening splendors of eternal day  THE POWER OF BEAUTY  BY  COME fair Dorinda and while Beauty glows  Warm on thy lovely cheek auspicious come  And animate my song O may I gaze  On every charm and from each shining grace  Catch inspiration let thy genius aid  My lays unpractis'd pour into my verse  The flow harmonious while th' enchanted Muse  Relates the charms which o'er the yielding heart  Perpetual reign and hold resistless sway  Diffusive Nature who with liberal hand  Scatters her bounties round and decks the Spring  In all its gay attire the Virgin's cheek  Flushes with beauty and adorns her brow  With charms attractive shapes her faultless form  With skill unerring on her breast bestows  The snowy hue while o'er her shining neck  In wanton ringlets flows her ebon hair  Dishevell'd graceful and her sparkling eyes  Dart kindling flame majestic on she moves  Conscious of native worth and smiling love  Alluring Hither ye whose hard'ned hearts  Ne'er felt a lover's pangs ah hither come  To feel the force of Beauty here survey  In radiant lustre the bewitching grace  Which from the dawn of time o'er Nature held  Her soft domain Since first the vital spark  Awak'd the human breast and Man arose  To conscious being the fair female form  Dazzled his eye and thro' his panting breast  Shot Beauty's ray When in primaeval Spring  Life uncorrupted roll'd its golden hours  Free from th' attacks of Vice as yet unsour'd  With Pain corroding nor Disease had rear'd  Her snaky crest to blast their blooming days  Then Beauty reign'd and form'd the sacred tye  Connubial Oft amid the green retreat  Where fanning zephrys play'd the joyous Hour  Fled on the wings of Love here Innocence  And balmy Peace and Friendship heavenborn Power  By Beauty heighten'd o'er the human pair  Their choicest influence shed Nor Beauty less  Thro' long succeeding ages o'er the heart  Her conquest held devoted man attests  The pleasing truth while at the syren voice  Of Music thrilling the enchanting note  He prostrate falls the fond distracted prey  Of passions raging thro' th' enfever'd heart  So Nature wills and while encreasing strength  Braces the nerves and thro' the swelling veins  The blood fierceboiling flows subduing Love  Still reigns in man to polish and refine  His barbarous mind nor till the soothing flame  Has seiz'd his heart and thaw'd his frozen soul  E'er can he relish the sublime delight  Of social transport nor consenting feel  The sympathetic bliss nor taste the sweets  Of hallow'd Friendship nor affected hear  The voice of Woe as oft she vents her moan  In wailings loud The soft relenting heart  Kind Pity's tear the allprofusive hand  Of Charity the generous flow of soul  These are not his who never yet has felt  The pangs of Love o'er whom th' enchanting power  Of Beauty never reign'd whose sullen breast  Ne'er glow'd with transport and the anxious throbs  Which panting lovers know but all his soul  Is solitary gloom untaught to pour  The friendly fervor and with heart enlarg'd  To breathe the warm benevolence of Love  Come ye who now your gayest moments pass  And graceful flourish 'midst the shining throng  Whilst life flies joyous and your youthful years  Roll placid on before the radiant throne  Of Beauty kneel Whatever warms the breast  With noble purpose what informs the heart  To melt and moulds you into social man  Is Beauty's power From her poetic heat  Derives new fire and taught by her oft paints  The visionary scene and touches all  The springs of passion hers each winning grace  And comely gesture hers enfrozen Age  Bending to earth beneath the weight of years  With wrinkled front and venerable hair  Melts at her fair approach he feels warm blood  Run thro' his wither'd veins erect he lifts  His hoary head and on his aged brow  Unusual gladness smiles while his cold heart  Warm'd into fervor glows her kindling voice  All rural nature hears and starts amaz'd  To polish'd life Thus when the rustic  Alluding to Dryden's beautiful fable of Cymon and Iphigenia  swain  Saw sleeping Beauty on the grassy bank  Reclin'd at ease and careless beaming round  Her charms attractive while upon her face  Play'd all the laughing loves surpriz'd he gaz'd  And felt a thousand transports shoot along  His shivering nerves now his unfeeling heart  Unus'd to pant with soft emotion heaves  He trembling view'd and all his soul was Love  And ye fair offspring of the bounteous hand  Of Nature ye array'd in all the charms  Of vernal youth flush'd on your comely cheek  By Beauty's balmy breath while yielding Man  To you resigns his heart and eager sighs  Low at your feet and tells the moving tale  Of plaintive love how sleepless on his couch  He counts the tedious hours or slumbering starts  From flattering visions which delusive swim  Before his eyes how busy Fancy paints  Your beauteous figure in resplendent robes  Luxuriant floating as you graceful move  In all the airs of love and while he grasps  Th' imagin'd form how lost in empty air  The fair illusion flies how taste forgets  The poignant relish and the spicy gale  To him no odours wafts cheerless and sad  He wanders pensive to the lonely shade  To blend his moanings with the whispering breeze  While sympathetic glides the weeping rill  In many currents by and there to thought  Devotes the gloomy hour complaining oft  In tender strains how fair Amanda scorns  His melting heart how slights the mournful tale  Of fond despairing love nor here can long  Indulge his woe but restless with the crowd  Impatient mingles solace there to find  Amidst the tumult of a maddening world  Still haunts the phantom still his bosom burns  With unremitted pain and Love resumes  His tyrant empire how his alter'd looks  Meagre and pale speak the distracting fiend  Which on his vitals preys how strength forsakes  His quivering limbs how wrapt in awful gloom  Frail sickening nature pines away in woe  O gently then ye lovely conquerors use  Your unresisted sway forth stretch your arms  To raise from abject plight the fainting slave  And on his tortur'd soul propitious pour  The balm of Hope and now delighted taste  Love's fond delights while Passion eager pants  In every vein and warms your glowing breasts  With fairy prospects of transporting joys  Nor gay Amanda tho' with sighs to you  The plaintive Damon kneels and vents his soul  In softly swelling strains yet let not these  Dilate your heart nor look with scornful air  On the gay rivals who with you contest  Fair Beauty's prize and vie supreme to shine  'Midst the soft circles where indulgent flow  The soothing hours where Music gently wakes  Symphonious every passion and attunes  The soul to rapture while diffusive joy  Spreads thro' the melting throng For Beauty still  By Taste is prov'd by her capricious law  It blooms or withers You who long have held  The willing Strephon o'er th' obdurate heart  Of Damon never reign'd while he subdu'd  By bright Amanda sighs his soul away  In unavailing moan Far from your breast  Be banish'd Pride the high assuming air  Ill suits the brow where Tenderness and Love  Should dwell distinguish'd nor can Reason judge  Whose charms superior shine some dazzling grace  Still nameless flashes on th' admiring eye  Beyond description fairer than her sex  To me Dorinda seems how darts her eye  Its souldissolving fires how o'er neck  Gracefully careless falls her auburn hair  Her mien how soft Can the pure mountain snow  With her warm bosom rising to the throbs  Of undissembled love compare its white  The rose its red with hers Nor Strephon less  Adores his blooming bride she fairer she  Is Beauty's self and as she gently moves  Her limbs proportion'd with unerring skill  A thousand radiant graces in her train  Alluring dance Each nameless charm is hers  And Love and Joy and Virtue sit enthron'd  In every look and smile Not varied more  The human face with different features stampt  By Nature's forming hand than Taste which views  In objects different various beauties glow  O while ye glory in your youthful prime  And yield attention to the syren voice  Of Praise in that soft season when the breast  A strange enchantment feels when Pleasure pants  In every vein and sparkles in the eye  Superfluous Health then guard your rebel hearts  Against seducing Love Suspend ye fair  These softer cares and listen while the Muse  Rises superior to the fading glare  Of mortal charms and now essays to touch  The heart and open to th' enraptur'd soul  More lasting Beauty moral and divine  Which grows in age nor at the pale approach  Of death decays but with unblasted grace  For ever blossoms Hail bright Virtue hail  Propitious come inspire my glowing breast  To sing of thee Without thee what are all  Life's gayest trappings what the fleeting show  Of youth or charms which for a moment spread  Their visionary bloom but withering die  Nor leave remembrance of their fancy'd worth  See how adorn'd in heaven's ailglorious pomp  Fair Virtue comes and in her radiant train  Ten thousand beauties wait behold she comes  To sill the soul with neverceasing joy  Attend her voice sweet as the solemn sounds  Of cherubs when they strike their golden harps  In sacred concert while the sky resounds  Symphonious Hence ye fond delusive dreams  Of fleeting pleasure she the heart distends  With more enduring bliss kindled by her  The generous bosom breathes the social sire  And beats responsive to the woes of man  Now native Peace and Harmony divine  Dwell in the soul to Reason's powerful law  Each passion yields and her resistless sway  Struggling Corruption owns nor dares assault  A heart confirm'd by her and now the fame  Of Nature conquer'd by th' informing voice  Of Reason thro' celestial mansions flies  On wings angelic thro' the winding paths  Of life fair Prudence guides and points the road  To Happiness and Peace while in the breast  Untainted Innocence and Freedom reign  These are the charms of Virtue these will bloom  When time shall cease ev'n Beauty's self by these  More lovely seems she looks with added grace  And smiles seraphic nor shall hoary age  Their blossoms wither but perpetual spring  Here shed her influence while a showy world  Its varnish losing shall deceive no more  And Nature sickening at approaching fate  Shall sink beneath its doom Whate'er adorns  The female breast whate'er can move the soul  With fervent rapture every winning grace  And mild endearment tenderness and love  In fair Aspasia  character in Mr Johnson's Irene  shine 'tis hers to charm  With elocution sweet and all the flow  Of soft persuasion while the sensual heart  Refines and feels fair Virtue dawning there  Nor ye gay glittering tribe who ofttimes drink  Of Circe's poison'd cup and down the stream  Of soothing pleasure all resistless flow  Enervate deem unworthy of your wish  The charms of Virtue While ye restless seek  The phantom Pleasure where Indulgence plays  Her midnight gambols o'er unstable paths  Ye heedless wander as she points the way  Thro' her enchanting maze th' illusive form  Conceals Destruction While with eager hope  And mad Impatience in a fond embrace  her panting lo the sorceress darts  Her latent venom thro' your tortur'd nerves  Then wakes Remorse and see on yonder throne  With woes surrounded fell Disease displays  Her snaky crest and o'er your guilty heads  Shakes all her horrors Anguish downcast Shame  Succeed and on the discontented brow  Satiety sits pale The feeble knee  Each nerve unbrac'd beneath the fabric bends  The tott'ring fabric falls the shades of death  Now quench those orbs that beam'd impure desire  And deeper yet the gloom of black despair  A darkness to be feltinvolves the soul  O dread this complicated curse and turn  With holy horror from the paths of Vice  Nor think ye fair the pensive Muse sorbids  The joys of Youth she with complacent smile  Views ye light flutt'ring she the social band  Joins chearful and benevolent implores  Diffusive Nature on your heads to shed  Her gay profusion lawish all her grace  And in your bosoms pour the soul of love  Lo rosy Youth holds forth her pictur'd scene  With garlands crown'd and tow'ring Fancy now  Her gay creation paints high swells the breast  With emulation and joyteeming life  Its gay allurements shews Forth by your side  In glittering grandeur walks th' enraptur'd swain  With graceful ease attemp'ring conscious pride  He spreads his glories to th' admiring eye  Awak'd by Love and by the subtle flame  Of Beauty kindled with assiduous care  And fond submission to the chearful haunts  Of Mirth he leads you and while wandering o'er  Enchanted ground oft

Pleasure guide our heedless steps  And safe conduct us to the bower of bliss  Supreme Directress she the breast instructs  To breathe love's purer flame graceful improves  Each varied motion beams th' expressive eye  And gives to Beauty all her power to charm  O let her influence fill the different scenes  Of joy and lovewhether we careless stray  Along the painted mead where fragrance blends  Her thousand sweets or tread the lengthen'd walk  While Music chears the soul and vistas green  Rise to the view and pour their fresh delights  On the bewilder'd eye or if we move  Along the hall refulgent with the blaze  Of India's stores and every measure trace  Or slow or sprightly while the lover feels  Unusual transports rush upon his soul  In admiration lost Ah here ye fair  Your gayest moments pass as to the touch  Ye yield your hand with palpitations quick  The snowy bosom heaves and unreserv'd  Breathes the warm wish of kind consenting love  Far from the bosom of the tender fair  Where love alone should dwell fly base deceit  Nor stain with perfidy the sacred shrine  Who's she that looks with high imperious mien  In yonder walk amidst her rivals deck'd  In yellow robes resplendent how she moves  With practis'd air and darts her meaning glance  Amidst the throng Thrown prostrate at her feet  The lover pleads nor she the lover hears  But swoln with pride of conquest scornful smiles  Yet if arous'd and conscious of his wrongs  He bids the last adieu she yet in store  Has thousand winning wiles the blood forsakes  Her blooming cheek and on her coral lip  Steals Paleness while adorn'd in all the charms  Of weeping beauty she resistless holds  The lover still her own With streaming eyes  Again he views her and his yielding heart  Melts with returning LoveInconstant still  She nor by pity mov'd nor gratitude  Nor awful virtue to the sighing slave  Resigns her heartthere Vanity still dwells  'Midst her fantastic joys enthron'd and plans  Unnumber'd conquests o'er admiring man  Love is not hers she never tastes the sweets  Of mutual rapture mutual fond esteem  Nor knows the charms of truth her bosom beats  With other throbs Anxieties and Fears  Ambition's train vex her aspiring soul  And Disappointment leaves its baleful sting  Be this her portion let her still possess  The dear deceitsAwake delusive thoughts  Selfadulation come and in her breast  Your soft enchantments pour Life's glories raise  The splendid scene and deck th' exulting fair  In all your fancied pompNor envy her  Ye faithful few whom the celestial grace  Of truth inspired for while she eager grasps  The flattering forms they faithless all elude  Her fond embrace and fleet in empty air  The fair Amanda knows no practis'd guile  To captivate the soul sweet innocence  And truth are hers and beauty unadorn'd  Save when diffusive steals the glowing blush  And shews her bright in every virgin charm  Her eyes no conquests seek nor beats her breast  With anxious throbs she Affectation's wiles  Nor practises nor knows stranger to these  She only conscious of her virgin worth  Heaves Nature's sighs and drest in Nature's grace  All lovely seems and moves attractive on  Amidst admiring swains at her approach  Each bosom flutters while the lovely maid  Nor scornful looks nor with consenting smile  Bids Admiration all its incense pour  To her bewitching charms yet on her brow  Modest Reserve oft sits forbidding all  Love's wanton hopes The fair Amanda thus  Resistless empire holds while aw'd we gaze  On every charm and at a distance sigh  Yet while the season of your blooming youth  Glides gently on and liberal Nature showers  Her gayest blessings peaceful on your heads  O then let Science on your easy hours  Serenely steal oft when the busy scene  Of meddling care and fond officious love  Shuts on your eyes and Solitude invites  To Meditation let her mild infuse  Her sweet instruction she the soul exalts  To dignity for when with knowledge blest  Fair Beauty smiles upon the blushing brow  Her soft persuasion wins the yielding heart  Resistless each with glowing ardour hears  Her eloquence divine the tuneful flow  Of sweetest periods warbling from the lips  Where raptures hang the captivated soul  While Beauty triumphs owns her boundless sway  Oft let me wander thro' the green retreat  Where Meditation dwells and roses shed  Their mild perfumes wak'd by the genial breath  Of May while gently by the purling stream  Its crystal waters roll to crown my bliss  Let sweet Ardelia come on her attends  Each mild engaging grace each nameless charm  Alluring Nature bounteous on her brow  Beams all its beauties and the soul by her  Is charm'd to rapture she the mind informs  With knowledge which from her persuasive tongue  Alluring streams while Music lends its voice  Melodious and the Sapphic Muse awaits  Soft in her train to breathe into her breast  Th' inspiring genius she in melting lays  Sweet as herself in the warm bosom wakes  The fond delights of love Here let us join  To sing of Nature as we pleas'd survey  The beauteous landscape round or frequent turn  The moving page where glows poetic flame  And Harmony with Nature's Shakespear rove  Thro' all the fairy regions or oft fly  With Milton boundless thro' ethereal worlds  Let raptur'd Fancy feel the circling year  Roll o'er our heads and mark the changing scenes  Of Nature drest in his immortal lays  Who sung the Seasons Thus may gentle hours  In sweet improvement pass and still return  Auspicious for with thee the beating heart  Feels fond emotion and the soul dissolves  In speechless transport of increasing joy  Ye lovely fair while flowery chaplets bind  Your youthful brows and o'er the verdant paths  Of gently gliding life ye graceful sweep  Array'd in purple pride as on your breast  The diamond shines and in your floating train  The ruby glows and emeralds around  Beset the flying robe while dazzling thus  In orient pomp forgive if yet the Muse  In moralizing strains essays to draw  The evening veil o'er all the glitt'ring show  Vain is their blaze which like the noontide day  Dazzles the eye so flaunt the gaudy flowers  In vernal glory wide diffusing round  Their odoriferous sweets and shoot profuse  Their blossoms forth and flourish in their May  In Nature's livery clad but when the sun  Beams in his pride they droop their blushing heads  Their blossoms wither and their varied tints  Fade with his sultry rays Behold ye fair  Your gay delusions read in Nature's book  Their transitory life how quickly fleets  The dream of pleasure at the pale approach  Of death grim blasting all your pictur'd hopes  So fell Amynta in her bloom of days  Joy flush'd her brow and Expectation swell'd  Her beating bosom Love its tribute paid  To her bewitching charms about to taste  Connubial transports and in Damon's arms  To share the licens'd bliss while Virtue's self  Beheld complacent the indulging pair  Elated thus the fair Amynta felt  The pangs of love her wishes wing'd their flight  To future periods in idea all  Life's softest blessings revell'd in her heart  Oft did the lovers court the lonely shade  Reclusely happy there to mingle sighs  In Nature's warmth thrown on the flowery lap  Of the fresh earth where roses blush around  They breath'd their mutual vows and tasted all  Th' endearing sweets of uncorrupted love  Dear hapless fair amidst her warmest hopes  When Fancy figur'd all the tender scene  Of mutual rapture she devoted fell  The mournful victim of the conquering hand  Of unrelenting Death he dread approach'd  And Nature trembled at his ghastly mien  Her Damon now in moving strains laments  And sadly pensive to her sacred tomb  He oft repairs there drops a lover's tear  While fond Remembrance opens all the scene  Of past delight calls forth his beauteous bride  In visionary bloom once more to blaze  In allattractive charms till lost again  The phantom glides in air all Nature wears  To him a face of woe the valleys round  Reecho doleful to his moving moan  So Beauty fades so fleets its showy life  As droops the lily clad in all its pride  Of rich array Yet while the pensive muse  Touches the springs of grief may no dark gloom  O'erwhelm your souls for innocence survives  To bloom eternal and while life invites  To view its gayer scenes amidst the pomp  Of radiant courts still chearful move along  Its flowery walks and lead with jovial heart  The laughing moments on for Beauty shines  First in the gaudy circles and commands  Fond admiration As Britannia's sons  Excel in every virtue manly brave  Amidst th' alarms of fate gen'rous sincere  By glory kindled may her virgins too  Supremely fair 'midst Beauty's brightest blaze  In soft perfections shine may Hymen wave  His purple wings and o'er the sacred couch  His azure mantle spread as down ye sink  In wedlock's chaste embrace and oft renew  The hallow'd rapture thus may peaceful life  Flow undisturb'd nor jarring feud invade  Your happy hours And ye gay circles now  Forgive the Muse which daring thus has sung  Of Beauty's triumphs tho' unequal far  To the delightful theme yet Beauty charm'd  My soul and pour'd into my glowing breast  Her fascination led me thro' the maze  Of Love nor unambitious of applause  She courts your smiles yours is her pleasing song  To you she warbles and devoted pays  Her fond oblation to your radiant charms  But chief indulgent 'midst the shining throng  Will fair Dorinda smile she first inspir'd  My heart with Love to her my early Muse  Her infant raptures pour'd happy if now  Sweet flow my numbers on her judging ear  And steal persuasive to her virgin breast  IL PACIFICO  WRITTEN ON THE CONCLUSION OF THE PEACE OF AIXLACHAPELLE MDCCXLVIII  BY MR MASON  HENCE pestilential Mars  Of sablevested night and chaos bred  On matter's formless bed  'Mid the harsh din of elemental jars  Hence with thy frantic crowd  Wing'd Flight pale Terror Discord cloath'd in fire

 Closely clasp'd Harmonia fair  For banish'd erst heaven's starpav'd floor  As sings my legendary lore  As Phoebus fat by weeping brook  With shepherds scrip and shepherds crook  Pensive 'midst a

heaped hill  Level river dancing rill  Where the shepherds all appear  To shear and wash their fleecy care  Which bleating stand the streams around  And whiten all the closecropt ground  Or when the maids in bonnets sheen  Cock the hay upon the green  Or up yon steep rough road the swains  Drive slow along their rolling wains  Where laughing Ceres crowns the stack  And makes the ponderous axle crack  Then to the village on the hill  The barns capacious jaws to fill  Where the answering flails rebound  Beating bold with thundering sound  Enchanted with this rural scene  Here let me weave my

Hold dalliance with my darling muse  Recalling oft some heavenborn strain  That warbled in Augustan reign  Or turn well pleas'd the Grecian page  If sweet Theocritus engage  Or blith Anacreon mirthful wight  Caroll his easy lovelay light  Yet let not all my pleasure lie  Confin'd to one Phoebeian joy  But ever give my fingers wings  Lightly to skim the trembling strings  And from some bower to tune the lay  While list'ning birds crowd every spray  Or hovering silent o'er my head  Their quivering wings exulting spread  Save but the turtles they alone  With tender plaintive faithful moan  Shall tell to all the secret grove  Their soft thickwarbled tale of love  Sweet birds your mingling bliss pursuing  Ever billing ever cooing  Ye constant pair I love to note  Your hoarse strain gurgling in your throat  And ye unheard from sidelong hills  The liquid lapse of whispering rills  I hist to hear such sounds diffuse  Sweet transports to the thoughtful muse  Thus summer sees me brisk and light  Till winter spreads her 'kerchief white  Then to the city's social walls  Where tolling clock to business calls  There the weaver's shuttle speeds  Nimbly thro' the finespun threads  There the vocal anvil rings  While the smith his hammer swings  And every man and every boy  Briskly join in warm employ  Thro' such throng'd scenes full oft I'll range  Oft crowd into the rich exchange  Or to yon wharf aside the mote  Where the anchor'd ships do float  And others hastening into bay  Swell their sails in fair array  Wasting to Albion's sons the store  That each Peruvian mine can pour  Wafting to Albion's smiling dames  The ruby's glow the diamond's flames  Till all the Indies rush into the Thames  Joys vast as these my fancy claims  And joys like these if Peace inspire  Peace with thee I

peaceful vale  Where Science call'd thee to her studious quire  And met thee musing in her cloysters pale  O let thy friend and may he boast the name  Breathe from his artless reed one parting lay  A lay like this thy early Virtues claim  And this let voluntary Friendship pay  Yet know the time arrives the dangerous time  When all those Virtues opening now so fair  Transplanted to the world's tempestuous clime  Must learn each passion's boisterous breath to bear  There if Ambition pestilent and pale  Or Luxury should taint their vernal glow  If cold Selfinterest with her chilling gale  Should blast th' unfolding blossoms e'er they blow  If mimic hues by Art or Fashion spread  Their genuine simple colouring should supply  O with them may these laureate honours fade  And with them if it can my friendship die  Then do not blame if tho' thyself inspire  Cautious I strike the panegyric string  The muse full oft pursues a meteor fire  And vainly ventrous soars on waxen wing  Too actively awake at Friendship's voice  The poet's bosom pours the servent strain  Till sad Reflection blames the hasty choice  And oft invokes Oblivion's aid in vain  Call we the shade of Pope from that blest bower  Where thron'd he sits with many a tuneful Sage  Ask if he ne'er bemoans that hapless hour  When St John's name  Alluding to this couplet of Mr Pope's  To Cato Virgil paid one honest line  O let my country's friends illumine mine  illumin'd Glory's page  Ask if the wretch who dar'd his memory stain  Ask if his country's his religion's foe  Deserv'd the meed that Marlbro' fail'd to gain  The deathless meed he only could bestow  The bard will tell thee the misguided praise  Clouds the celestial sunshine of his breast  Ev'n now repentant of his erring lays  He heaves a sigh amid the realms of rest  If Pope thro' friendship fail'd indignant view  Yet pity Dryden hark whene'er he sings  How Adulation drops her courtly dew  On titled Rhymers and inglorious Kings  See from the depths of his exhaustless mine  His glittering stores the tuneful spendthrift throws  Where Fear or Interest bids behold they shine  Now grace a Cromwell's now a Charles's brows  Born with too generous or too mean a heart  Dryden in vain to thee those stores were lent  Thy sweetest numbers but a trifling art  Thy strongest diction idly eloquent  The simplest Lyre if Truth directs its lays  Warbles a melody ne'er heard from thine  Not to disgust with false or venal praise  Was Parnell's modest fame and may be mine  Go then my friend nor let thy candid breast  Condemn me if I check the plausive string  Go to the wayward world complete the rest  Be what the purest muse would wish to sing  Be still thyself that open path of truth  Which led thee here let Manhood firm pursue  Retain the sweet simplicity of Youth  And all thy virtue dictates dare to do  Still scorn with conscious pride the mask of Art  On Vice's front let fearful Caution lour  And teach the diffident discreeter part  Of knaves that plot and fools that fawn for power  So round thy brow when age's honours spread  When Death's cold hand unstrings thy Mason's lyre  When the green turf lies lightly on his head  Thy worth shall some superior bard inspire  He to the amplest bounds of time's domain  On rapture's plume shall give thy name to fly  For trust with reverence trust this Sabine strain  " The muse forbids the virtuous man to die"  ISIS AN ELEGY  MDCCXLVIII  BY THE SAME  FAR from her hallow'd grot where mildly bright  The pointed crystals shot their trembling light  From dripping moss where sparkling dewdrops fell  Where coral glow'd where twin'd the wreathed shell  Pale Isis lay a willow's lowly shade  Spread its thin foliage o'er the sleeping maid  Clos'd was her eye and from her heaving breast  In careless folds loose flow'd her zoneless vest  While down her neck her vagrant tresses flow  In all the awful negligence of woe  Her urn sustain'd her arm that sculptur'd vase  Where Vulcan's art had lavish'd all its grace  Here full with life was heaventaught Science seen  Known by the laurel wreath and musing mien  There cloudcrown'd Fame here Peace sedate and bland  Swell'd the loud trump and wav'd the olive wand  While solemn domes arch'd shades and vistas green  At wellmark'd distance close the sacred scene  On this the Goddess cast an anxious look  Then dropt a tender tear and thus she spoke  Yes I could once with pleas'd attention trace  The mimic charms of this prophetic vase  Then lift my head and with enraptur'd eyes  View on you plain the real glories rise  Yes Isis oft hast thou rejoic'd to lead  Thy liquid treasures o'er yon favourite mead  Oft hast thou stopt thy pearly car to gaze  While every Science nurs'd its growing bays  While every Youth with fame's strong impulse fir'd  Prest to the goal and at the goal untir'd  Snatch'd each celestial wreath to bind his brow  The Muses Graces Virtues could bestow  Ev'n now fond Fancy leads th' ideal train  And ranks her troops on Memory's ample plain  See the firm leaders of my patriot line  See Sidney Raleigh Hampden Somers shine  See Hough superior to a tyrant's doom  Smile at the menace of the slave of Rome  Each soul whom truth could fire or virtue move  Each breast strong panting with its country's love  All that to Albion gave the heart or head  That wisely counsell'd or that bravely bled  All all appear on me they grateful smile  The wellearn'd prize of every virtuous toil  To me with filial reverence they bring  And hang fresh trophies o'er my honour'd spring  Ah I remember well you beachen spray  There Addison first tun'd his polish'd lay  'Twas there great Cato's form first met his eye  In all the pomp of freeborn majesty  " My son he cry'd observe this mien with awe  " In solemn lines the strong resemblance draw  " The piercing notes shall strike each British ear  " Each British eye shall drop the patriot tear  " And rous'd to glory by the nervous strain  " Each youth shall spurn at Slavery's abject reign  " Shall guard with Cato's zeal Britannia's laws  " And speak and act and bleed in Freedom's cause"  The hero spoke the bard assenting bow'd  The lay to Liberty and Cato flow'd  While Echo as she rov'd the vale along  Join'd the strong cadence of his Roman song  But ah how Stillness slept upon the ground  How mute Attention check'd each rising sound  Scarce stole a breeze to wave the leafy spray  Scarce thrill'd sweet Philomel her softest lay  When Locke walk'd musing forth ev'n now I view  Majestic Wisdom thron'd upon his brow  View Candor smile upon his modest cheek  And from his eye all Judgment's radiance break  'Twas here the Sage his manly zeal exprest  Here stript vain Falshood of her gaudy vest  Here Truth's collected beams first fill'd his mind  Ere long to burst in blessings on mankind  Ere long to shew to Reason's purged eye  That "Nature's first best gift was Liberty"  Proud of this wond'rous son sublime I stood  While louder surges swell'd my rapid flood  Then vain as Niobe exulting cry'd  Ilissus roll thy fam'd Athenian tide  Tho' Plato's steps oft mark'd thy neighb'ring glade  Tho' fair Lycaeum lent its awful shade  Tho' every academic green imprest  Its image full on thy reflecting breast  Yet my pure stream shall boast as proud a name  And Britain's Isis flow with Attic fame  Alas how chang'd where now that Attic boast  See Gothic Licence rage o'er all my coast  See Hydra Faction spread its impious reign  Poison each breast and madden every brain  Hence frontless crowds that not content to fright  The blushing Cynthia from her throne of night  Blast the fair face of day and madly bold  To Freedom's foes infernal orgies hold  To Freedom's foes ah see the goblet crown'd  Hear plausive shouts to Freedom's foes resound  The horrid notes my refluent waters daunt  The Echoes groan the Dryads quit their haunt  Learning that once to all diffus'd her beam  Now sheds by stealth a partial private gleam  In some lone cloister's melancholy shade  Where a firm few support her fickly head  Despis'd insulted by the barbarous train  Who scour like Thracia's moonstruck rout the plain  Sworn foes like them to all the Muse approves  All Phoebus favours or Minerva loves  Are these the sons my fostering breast must rear  Grac'd with my name and nurtur'd by my care  Must these go forth from my maternal hand  To deal their insults thro' a peaceful land  And boast while Freedom bleeds and Virtue groans  That "Isis taught rebellion to her sons"  Forbid it Heaven and let my rising waves  Indignant swell and whelm the recreant slaves  In England's cause their patriot floods employ  As Xanthus delug'd in the cause of Troy  Is this deny'd then point some secret way  Where far far hence these guiltless streams may stray  Some unknown channel lend where Nature spreads  Inglorious vales and unfrequented meads  There where a hind scarce tunes his rustic strain  Where scarce a pilgrim treads the pathless plain  Content I'll flow forget that e'er my tide  Saw yon majestic structures crown its side  Forget that e'er my rapt attention hung  Or on the Sage's or the Poet's tongue  Calm and resign'd my humbler lot embrace  And pleas'd prefer Oblivion to Disgrace  THE TRIUMPH OF ISIS  OCCASIONED BY THE FOREGOING POEM  BY DR THOMAS WARTON  ON closing flowers when genial gales diffuse  The fragrant tribute of refreshing dews  When chaunts the milkmaid at her balmy pail  And weary reapers whistle o'er the vale  Charm'd by the murmurs of the quivering shade  O'er Isis' willowfringed banks I stray'd  And calmly musing thro' the twilight way  In pensive mood I fram'd the Doric lay  When lo from opening clouds a golden gleam  Pour'd sudden splendors o'er the shadowy stream  And from the wave arose its guardian queen  Known by her sweeping stole of glossy green  While in the coral crown that bound her brow  Was wove the Delphic laurel's verdant bough  As the smooth surface of the dimply flood  The silverslipper'd Isis lightly trod  From her loose hair the dropping dew she press'd  And thus mine ear in accents mild address'd  No more my son the rural reed employ  Nor trill the trifting strain of empty joy  No more thy loveresounding sonnets suit  To notes of pastoral pipe or oaten flute  For hark highthron'd on you majestic walls  To the dear Muse afflicted Freedom calls  When Freedom calls and Oxford bids thee sing  Why stays thy hand to strike the sounding string  While thus in Freedom's and in Phoebus' spite  The venal sons of slavish Cam unite  To shake yon towers when Malice rears her crest  Shall all my sons in silence idly rest  Still sing O Cam your favourite Freedom's cause  Still boast of Freedom while you break her laws  To power your songs of gratulation pay  To courts address soft Flattery's soothing lay  What tho' your gentle Mason's plaintive verse  Has hung with sweetest wreaths Musaeus' hearse  What tho' your vaunted bard's ingenuous woe  Soft as my stream in tuneful numbers flow  Yet strove his Muse by Fame or Envy led  To tear the laurels from a sister's head  Misguided youth with rude unclassic rage  To blot the beauties of thy whiter page  A rage that sullies ev'n thy guiltless lays  And blasts the vernal bloom of half thy bays  Let Granta boast the patrons of her name  Each pompous fool of Fortune and of Fame  Still of preferment let her shine the queen  Prolific parent of each bowing dean  Be hers each prelate of the pamper'd cheek  Each courtly chaplain sanctify'd and sleek  Still let the drones of her exhaustless hive  On fat pluralities supinely thrive  Still let her senates titled slaves revere  Nor dare to know the patriot from the peer  For tinsel'd courts their laurel'd mount despise  In stars and strings superlatively wise  No longer charm'd by Virtue's golden lyre  Who sung of old amid th' Aonian choir  Where Cam slow winding thro' the breezy reeds  With kindly wave his groves of laurel feeds  'Tis ours my son to deal the sacred bay  Where Honour calls and Justice points the way  To wear the wellearn'd wreath which Merit brings  And snatch a gift beyond the reach of kings  Scorning and scorn'd by courts yon Muses' bower  Still nor enjoys nor asks the smile of power  Tho' wakeful Vengeance watch my crystal spring  Tho' Persecution wave her iron wing  And o'er yon spiry temples as she flies  " These destin'd seats be mine" exulting cries  On Isis still each gift of Fortune waits  Still Peace and Plenty deck my beauteous gates  See Science walks with freshest chaplets crown'd  With songs of joy my festal groves resound  My Muse divine still keeps her wonted state  The front erect and high majestic gait  Green as of old each oliv'd portal smiles  And still the Graces build my Parian piles  My Gothic spires in ancient grandeur rise  And dare with wonted pride to rush into the skies  Ah should'st thou fall forbid it heavenly powers  Dash'd into dust with all thy cloudcapt towers  Who but would mourn to British virtue dear  What patriot could refuse the manly tear  What British Marius could refrain to weep  O'er mighty Carthage fall'n a prostrate heap  Ev'n late when Radcliffe's delegated train  Auspicious shone in Isis' happy plain  When yon proud  Radcliffe's library  dome fair Learning's amplest shrine  Beneath its Attic roofs receiv'd the nine  Mute was the voice of joy and loud applause  To Radcliffe due and Isis' honour'd cause  What freeborn crowds adorn the festive day  Nor blush'd to wear my tributary bay  How each brave breast with honest ardors heav'd  When Sheldon's fane the patriot band receiv'd  While as we loudly hail'd the chosen few  Rome's awful senate rush'd upon our view  O may the day in latest annals shine  That made a Beaufort and an Harley mine  Then bade them leave the lostier scene awhile  The pomp of guiltless state the patriot toil  For bleeding Albion's aid the sage design  To hold short dalliance with the tuneful nine  Then Music left her golden sphere on high  And bore each strain of triumph from the sky  Swell'd the full song and to my chiefs around  Pour'd the full Paeans of mellifluous sound  My Naiads blythe the floating accents caught  And listening danc'd beneath their pearly grot  In gentler eddies play'd my wanton wave  And all my reeds their softest whispers gave  Each lay with brighter green adorn'd my bowers  And breath'd a fresher fragrance on my flowers  But lo at once the swelling concerts cease  And crowded theatres are hush'd in peace  See on yon Sage how all attentive stand  To catch his darting eye and waving hand  Hark he begins with all a Tully's art  To pour the dictates of a Cato's heart  Skill'd to pronounce what noblest thoughts inspire  He blends the speaker's with the patriot's fire  Bold to conceive nor timorous to conceal  What Britons dare to think he dares to tell  'Tis his alike the ear and eye to charm  To win with action and with sense to warm  Untaught in flowery diction to dispense  The lulling sounds of sweet impertinence  In frowns or smiles he gains an equal prize  Nor meanly fears to sall not creeps to rise  Bids happier days to Albion be restor'd  Bids ancient Justice rear her radiant sword  From me as from my country wins applause  And makes an Oxford's a Britannia's cause  While arms like these my stedfast sages wield  While mine is Truth's impenetrable shield  Say shall the puny champion fondly dare  To wage with force like this scholastic war  Still vainly scribble on with pert pretence  With all the rage of pedant impotence  Say shall I suffer this domestic pest  This parricide that wounds a mother's breast  Thus in the stately ship that long has bore  Britain's victorious cross from shore to shore  By chance beneath her close sequester'd cells  Some lowborn worm a lurking mischief dwells  Eats his blind way and saps with secret toil  The deep foundations of the watry pile  In vain the forest lent its stateliest pride  Rear'd her tall mast and fram'd her knotty side  In vain the thunder's martial rage she stood  With each fierce conflict of the stormy flood  More sure the reptile's little arts devour  Than waves or wars or Eurus' wintry power  Ye venerable bowers ye seats sublime  Clad in the mossy vest of fleeting time  Ye stately piles of old munificence  At once the pride of learning and defence  Where ancient Piety a matron hoar  Still seems to keep the hospitable door  Ye cloisters pale that length'ning to the sight  Still step by step to musings mild invite  Ye high arch'd walks where oft the

the mind  Our British Therons issue to the race  Of their own generous coursers the disgrace  What tho' the grooms of Greece ne'er took the odds  They won no betsbut then they soar'd to gods  And more an Hiero's palm a Pindar's ode  Than all th' united plates of George bestow'd  Greece how I kindle at thy magic name  Feel all thy warmth and catch the kindred flame  Thy solemn scenes and awful visions rise  In ancient grace before my musing eyes  Here Sparta's sons in mute attention hang  While sage Lycurgus pours the mild harangue  There Xerxes' host all pale with deadly fear  Shrink at her  Leonidas  fated hero's flashing spear  Here hung with many a lyre of silver string  The laureat walks of sweet Ilissus spring  And lo where rapt in beauty's heavenly dream  Hoar Plato walks his oliv'd Academe  Yet ah no more the seat of art and arms  Delights with wisdom or with virtue warms  Lo the stern Turk with more than Gothic rage  Has blasted all the bays of ancient age  No more her groves by sacred feet are trod  Each Attic Grace has left the lov'd abode  Fall'n is fair Greece by Luxury's pleasing bane  Seduc'd she drags a barbarous foreign chain  Britannia watch O trim thy withering bays  Remember thou hast rivall'd Graecia's praise  Great Nurse of works divine yet oh beware  Lest thou the fate of Greece my Country share  Recall thy wonted worth with conscious pride  Thou too hast seen a Solon in a Hyde  Hast bade thine Edwards and thine Henry's rear  With Spartan fortitude the British spear  Alike hast seen thy sons deserve the meed  Or of the moral or the

sorrows that embalm the brave  The tears that Science sheds on Glory's grave  So pure the vews which classic duty pays  To bless another Brunswick's rising rays  O Pitt if chosen strains have power to steal  Thy watchful breast awhile from Britain's weal  If votive verse from sacred Isis sent  Might hope to charm thy manly mind intent  On patriot plans which ancient Freedom drew  Awhile with sond attention deign to view  This ample wreath which all th' assembled Nine  With skill united have conspir'd to twine  Yes guide and guardian of thy country's cause  Thy conscious heart shall hail with just applause  The duteous Muse whose haste officious brings  Her blameless offering to the shrine of kings  Thy tongue well tutor'd in historic lore  Can speak her office and her use of yore  For such the tribute of ingenuous praise  Her harp dispensed in Graecia's golden days  Such were the palms in isles of old renown  She cull'd to deck the guiltless monarch's crown  When virtuous Pindar told with Tuscan gore  How scepter'd Hiero stain'd Sicilia's shore  Or to mild Theron's raptur'd eye disclos'd  Bright vales where spirits of the brave repos'd  Yet still beneath the throne unbrib'd she sate  The decent handmaid not the slave of state  Pleas'd in the radiance of the regal name  To blend the lustre of her country's fame  For taught like ours she dar'd with prudent pride  Obedience from dependance to divide  Tho' princes claim'd her tributary lays  With truth severe she temper'd partial praise  Conscious she kept her native dignity  Bold as her flights and as her numbers free  And sure if e'er the Muse indulg'd her strains  With just regard to grace heroic reigns  Where could her glance a theme of triumph own  So dear to same as George's trophied throne  At whose firm base thy stedfast soul aspires  To wake a mighty nation's ancient fires  Aspires to bassle faction's specious claim  Rouse England's rage and give her thunder aim  Once more the main her conquering banners sweep  Again her commerce darkens all the deep  Thy fix'd resolve renews each fair decree  That made that kept of yore thy country free  Call'd by thy voice nor deaf to war's alarms  Its willing youth the rural empire arms  Again the lords of Albion's cultur'd plains  March the firm leaders of their faithful swains  As erst stout archers from the farm or fold  Flam'd in the van of many a baron bold  Nor thine the pomp of indolent debate  The war of words the sophistries of state  Nor frigid caution checks thy free design  Nor stops thy stream of eloquence divine  For thine the privilege on few bestow'd  To feel to think to speak for public good  In vain Corruption calls her venal tribes  One common cause one common end prescribes  Nor fear nor fraud or spares or screens the foe  But spirit prompts and valour strikes the blow  O Pitt while honour points thy liberal plan  And o'er the minister exalts the man  Isis congenial greets thy faithful sway  Nor scorns to bid a statesman grace her lay  For science still is justly fond to blend  With thine her practice principles and end  'Tis not for her by false connections drawn  At splendid Slavery's fordid shrine to fawn  Each native effort of the feeling breast  To friends to foes in servile fear supprest  'Tis not for her to purchase or pursue  The phantom favours of the cringing crew  More useful toils her studious hours engage  And fairer lessons fill her spotless page  Beneath ambition but above disgrace  With nobler arts she forms the rising race  With happier tasks and less refin'd pretence  In elder times she woo'd Munificence  To rear her arched roofs in regal guise  And lift her temples nearer to the skies  Princes and prelates stretch'd the social band  To form diffuse and fix her high command  From kings she claim'd yet scorn'd to seek the prize  From kings like George benignant just and wise  Lo this her genuine loreNor thou refuse  This humble present of no partial muse  From that calm bower which nurs'd thy thoughtful youth  In the pure precepts of Athenian truth  Where first the form of British Liberty  Beam'd in full radiance on thy musing eye  That form whose mien sublime with equal awe  In the same shade unblemish'd Somers saw  Where once for well she lov'd the friendly grove  Which every classic Grace had learn'd to rove  Her whispers wak'd sage Harrington to feign  The blessings of her visionary reign  That reign which now no more an empty theme  Adorns philosophy's ideal dream  But crowns at last beneath a George's smile  In full reality this favour'd isle  ON THE MARRIAGE OF KING GEORGE THE THIRD AND QUEEN CHARLOTTE  BY THE SAME  TO THE QUEEN  WHEN first the kingdom to thy virtues due  Rose from the billowy deep in distant view  When Albion's isles old ocean's peerless pride  Tower'd in imperial state above the tide  What bright ideas of the new domain  Form'd the fair prospect of thy promis'd reign  And well with conscious joy thy breast might beat  That Albion was ordain'd thy regal seat  Lo this the land where Freedom's sacred rage  Has glow'd untam'd thro' many a martial age  Here patriot Alfred stain'd with Danish blood  Rear'd on one base the king's the people's good  Here Henry's archers fram'd the stubborn bow  That laid Alanzon's haughty helmet low  Here wak'd the flame that still superior braves  The proudest threats of Gaul's ambitious slaves  Here chivalry stern school of valour old  Her noblest feats of knightly fame enroll'd  Heroic champions heard the clarion's call  And throng'd the board in Edward's banner'd hall  While chiefs like George approv'd in worth alone  Unlock'd chaste beauty's adamantine zone  Lo the fam'd isle which hails thy chosen sway  What fertile fields her temperate suns display  Where Property secures the conscious swain  And guards while Plenty gives the golden grain  Hence ripe with stores her villages abound  Her airy downs with scatter'd sheep resound  Fresh are her pastures with unceasing rills  And future navies crown her darksome hills  To bear her formidable glory far  Behold her opulence of hoarded war  See from her ports a thousand banners stream  On every coast her vengeful lightnings gleam  Meantime remote from Ruin's armed hand  In peaceful majesty her cities stand  Whose splendid domes and tradeful streets declare  Their firmest fort a king's parental care  And O blest queen if e'er the magic powers  Of warbled truth have won thy musing hours  Here Poesy from awful days of yore  Has pour'd her genuine gifts of raptur'd lore  'Mid oaken bowers with holy verdure wreath'd  In Druidsongs her solemn spirit breath'd  While cunning bards at ancient banquets sung  Of Paynim foes defy'd and trophies hung  Here Spenser tun'd his mystic minstrelsy  And dress'd in fairy robes a queen like thee  Here boldly mark'd with every living hue  Nature's unbounded portrait Shakespear drew  But chief the mournful group of human woes  The daring artist's tragic pencil chose  Explor'd the pangs that rend the royal breast  Those wounds that lurk beneath the tissu'd vest  Lo this the land whence Milton's muse of fire  High soar'd to steal from heaven a seraph's lyre  And told the golden ties of wedded love  In sacred Eden's amaranthine grove  Thine too majestic bride the favour'd clime  Where Science sits enshrin'd in roofs sublime  O mark how green her wood of ancient bays  O'er Isis marge in many a chaplet strays  Thither if haply some distinguish'd flower  Of these mix'd blooms from that ambrosial bower  Might catch thy glance and rich in Nature's hue  Entwine thy diadem with honour due  If seemly gifts the train of Phoebus pay  To deck imperial Hymen's festive day  Thither thyself shall haste and mildly deign  To tread with nymphlike step the conscious plain  Pleas'd in the Muse's nook with decent pride  To throw the scepter'd pall of state aside  Nor from the shade shall George be long away  Which claims Charlotta's love and courts her stay  These are Britannia's praises Deign to trace  With rapt reflection Freedom's favourite race  But tho' the generous isle in arts and arms  Thus stands supreme in Nature's choicest charms  Tho' George and conquest guard her seagirt throne  One happier blessing still she calls her own  And proud a fresh increase of fame to view  Crowns all her glory by possessing you  ON THE BIRTH OF GEORGE PRINCE OF WALES  WRITTEN AFTER AN INSTALLATION AT WINDSOR MDCCLXII  BY THE SAME  IMperial dome of Edward wise and brave  Where warlike Honour's brightest banners wave  At whose proud tilts unmatch'd for hardy deeds  Heroic kings have frown'd on barbed steeds  Tho' now no more thy crested chiefs advance  In arm'd array nor grasp the glittering lance  Tho' knighthood boasts the martial pomp no more  That grac'd its gorgeous festivals of yore  Say stately dome if e'er thy marshall'd knights  So nobly deck'd their old majestic rites  As when highthron'd amid thy trophied shrine  George shone the leader of the garter'd line  Yet future triumphs Windsor still remain  Still may thy bowers receive as brave a train  For lo to Britain and her favour'd pair  Heaven's high command has sent a sacred heir  Him the bold pattern of his patriot sire  Shall fill with early fame immortal fire  In life's fresh spring e'er buds the promis'd prime  His thoughts shall mount to virtue's meed sublime  The patriot sire shall catch with sure presage  Each liberal omen of his opening age  Then to thy courts shall lead with conscious joy  In stripling beauty's bloom the princely boy  There firmly wreath the braid of heavenly die  True Valour's badge around his tender thigh  Meantime thy royal piles that rise elate  With many an antique tower in massy state  In the young champion's musing mind shall raise  Vast images of Albion's elder days  While as around his eager glance explores  Thy chambers rough with war's constructed stores  Rude helms and bruised shields barbaric spoils  Of ancient chivalry's undaunted toils  Amid the dusky trappings hung on high  Young Edward's sable mail shall strike his eye  Shall fire the youth to crown his riper years  With rival Cressys and a new Poictiers  On the same wall the same triumphal base  His own victorious monument to place  Nor can a fairer kindred title move  His emulative age to glory's love  Than Edward laureat prince In letter'd truth  Oxford sage mother school'd this studious youth  Her simple institutes and rigid lore  The royal nursling unreluctant bore  Nor shunn'd at pensive eve with lonesome pace  The moonlight cloyster's checquer'd floor to trace  Nor scorn'd to mark the sun at mattins due  Stream thro' the storied window's holy hue  And O young prince be thine his moral praise  Nor seek in fields of blood his warrior bays  War has its charms terrisic Far and wide  When stands th' embattled host in banner'd pride  O'er the vext plain when the shrill clangors run  And the long phalanx flashes in the sun  When now no dangers of the deathful day  Mar the bright scene nor break the firm array  Full oft too rashly glows with fond delight  The youthful breast and asks the future fight  Nor knows that Horror's form a spectre wan  Stalks yet unseen along the gleamy van  May no such rage be thine no dazzling ray  Of specious fame thy stedfast feet betray  Be thine domestic glory's radiant calm  Be thine the scepter wreath'd with many a palm  Be thine the throne with peaceful emblems hung  The silver lyre to milder conquest strung  Instead of glorious feats atchiev'd in arms  Bid rising arts display their mimic charms  Just to thy country's fame in tranquil days  Record the past and rouse to future praise  Before the public eye in breathing brass  Bid thy fam'd father's mighty triumphs pass  Swell the broad arch with haughty Cuba's fall  And cloath with Minden's plain th' historic hall  Then mourn not Edward's dome thine ancient boast  They tournaments and listed combats lost  From Ar  's board no more proud castle mourn  Adventurous Valour's Gothic trophies torn  Those elfi  charms that held in magic night  elder  ame and dimm'd its genuine light  At length dissolve in Truth's meridian ray  And the bright order bursts to purer day  The mystic round begirt with bolder peers  On virtue's base its rescued glory rears  Sees civil prowess mightier acts atchieve  Sees meek humanity distress relieve

APPOINTED BY THE LATE LORD CREW BISHOP OF DURHAM FOR THE COMMEMORATION OF BENEFACTORS TO THE UNIVERSITY  BY THE SAME  I  WHERE shall the muse that on the sacred shell  Of men in arts and arms renown'd  The solemn strain delights to swell  O where shall Clio chuse a race  Whom fame with every laurel every grace  Like those of Albion's envied isle has crown'd  Daughter and mistress of the sea  Allhonour'd Albion hail  Wheree'er thy commerce spreads the swelling sail  Ne'er shall she find a land like thee  So brave so learned and so free  Allhonour'd Albion hail  II  But in the princely land of all that's good and great  Would Clio seek the most distinguish'd seat  Most blest where all is so sublimely blest  That with superior grace o'erlooks the rest  Like a rich gem in circling gold enshrin'd  Where Isis' waters wind  Along the sweetest shore  That ever felt fair Culture's hands  Or Spring's embroider'd mantle wore  Lo where majestic Oxford stands  Virtue's awful throne  Wisdom's immortal source  Thee well her best belov'd may boasting Albion own  Whence each fair purpose of ingenuous praise  All that in thought or deed divine is deem'd  In one unbounded tide one unremitted course  From age to age has still successive stream'd  Where Learning and where Liberty have nurst  For those that in their ranks have shone the first  Their most luxuriant growth of everblooming bays  III  In ancient days when she the queen endu'd  With more than female fortitude  Bo  ca led her painted ranks to fight  Ofttimes in adamantine arms array'd  Pallas descended from the realms of light  Imperial Britonesse thy kindred aid  As once allglowing from the wellfought day  The goddess sought a cooling stream  By chance inviting with their glassy gleam  Fair Isis' waters flow'd not far away  Eager she view'd the wave  On the cool bank she bar'd her breast  To the soft gale her locks ambrosial gave  And thus the watry nymph addrest  Hear gentle nymph whoe'er thou art  Thy sweet refreshing stores impart  A Goddess from thy mossy brink  Asks of thy crystal stream to drink  Lo Pallas asks the friendly gift  Thy coral crowned tresses lift  Rise from the wave propitious power  O listen from thy pearly bower  IV  Her accents Isis' calm attention caught  As lonesome in her secret cell  In evervarying hues as mimic fancy taught  She rang'd the manytinctur'd shell  Then from her work arose the N  mild  She rose and sweetly smil'd  With many a lovely look  That whisper'd soft consent  She smil'd and gave the Goddess in her flood  To dip her casque tho' dy'd in recent blood  While Pallas as the boon she took  Thus pour'd the grateful sentiment  For this thy flood the fairest name  Of all Britannia's streams shall glide  Best favourite of the sons of fame  Of every tuneful breast the pride  For on thy borders bounteous queen  Where now the cowslip paints the green  With unregarded grace  Her wanton herds where nature feeds  As lonesome o'er the breezy reeds  She bends her silent pace  Lo there to wisdom's goddess dear  A farfam'd city shall her turrets rear  There all her force shall Pallas prove  Of classic leaf with every crown  Each olive meed of old renown  Each ancient wreath which Athens wove  I'll bid her blooming bowers abound  And Oxford's sacred seats shall tower  To thee mild Nais of the flood  The trophy of my gratitude  The temple of my power  V  Nor was the pious promise vain  Soon illustrious Alfred came  And pitch'd fair Wisdom's tent on Isis' plenteous plain  Alfred on thee shall all the muses wait  Alfred majestic name  Of all our praise the spring  Thee all thy suns shall sing  Deck'd with the marshal and the civic wreath  In notes most awful shall the trumpet breathe  To thee great Romulus of Learning's richest stare  VI  Nor Alfred's bounteous hand alone  Oxford thy rising temples own  Soon many a man munificent  The prince the prelate laurelcrown'd crowd  Their ample bounty lent  To build the beauteous monument  That Pallas vow'd  And now she lifts her head sublime  Majestic in the moss of time  Nor wants there Grecia's better part  'Mid the proud piles of antient art  Whose fretted spires with ruder hand  Wainfleet and Wickham bravely plann'd  Nor decent Doric to dispense  New charms 'mid old magnificence  And here and there soft Corinth weares  Her daedal coronet of leaves  While as with rival pride their towers invade the sky  Radcliffe and Bodley seem to rye  Which shall deserve the foremost place  Or Gothic strength or Attic grace  VII  O Isis ever will I chant thy praise  Not that thy sons have struck the golden lyre  With hands most skilful have their brows entwin'd  With every fairest flower of Helicon  The sweetest swans of all th' harmonious choir  Have bad the musing mind  Of every science pierce the pathless ways  And from the rest the wreath of wisdom won  But that thy sons have dar'd to feel  For Freedom's cause a sacred zeal  With British breast and patriot pride  Have still Corruption's cup defy'd  In dangerous days untaught to fear  Have held the name of honour dear  VIII  But chief of this illustrious day  The Muse her loudest Paeans loves to pay  Ere while she strove with accents weak  In vain to build the lofty rhyme  At length by better days of bounty chear'd  She dares unfold her wing  Hail hour of transport most sublime  In which the man rever'd  Immortal Crew commands to sing  And

her with my latest breath  How bless'd her absent in the midst of death  Ye conscious skies ye lights celestial tell  Farewel O loveliest of thy sex farewel  Farewel my chiefs in my example see  What monarch general patriot friend should be  ELEGY  WRITTEN AT THE APPROACH OF SPRING  BY JOHN SCOTT ESQ  STERN Winter hence with all his train removes  And chearful skies and limpid streams are seen  Thicksprouting foliage decorates the groves  Reviving herbage robes the fields in green  Yet lovelier scenes shall crown th' advancing year  When blooming Spring's full bounty is display'd  The smile of beauty every vale shall wear  The voice of song enliven every shade  O Fancy paint not coming days too fair  Oft for the prospects sprightly May should yield  Rainpouring clouds have darken'd all the air  Or snows untimely whiten'd o'er the field  But should kind Spring her wonted bounty shower  The smile of beauty and the voice of song  If gloomy thought the human mind o'erpower  Ev'n vernal hours glide unenjoy'd along  I shun the scenes where maddening Passion raves  Where Pride and Folly high dominion hold  And unrelenting Avarice drives her slaves  O'er prostrate Virtue in pursuit of gold  The grassy lane the woodsurrounded field  The rude stonefence with fragrant wallflowers gay  The claybuilt cot to me more pleasure yield  Than all the pomp imperial domes display  And yet ev'n here amid these secret shades  These simple scenes of unreprov'd delight  Affliction's iron hand my breast invades  And Death's dread dart is ever in my sight  While genial suns to genial showers succeed  The air all mildness and the earth all bloom  While herds and flocks range sportive o'er the mead  Crop the sweet herb and snuff the rich perfume  O why alone to hapless man deny'd  To taste the bliss inferior beings boast  O why this fate that fear and pain divide  His few short hours on earth's delightful coast  Ah ceaseno more of Providence complain  'Tis sense of guilt that wakes the mind to woe  Gives force to fear adds energy to pain  And palls each joy by heaven indulg'd below  Why else the smiling infant train so blest  Ere dearbought knowledge ends the peace within  Or wild desire inflames the youthful breast  Or ill propension ripens into sin  As to the bleating tenants of the field  As to the sportive warblers on the trees  To them their joys sincere the seasons yield  And all their days and all their prospects please  Such joys were mine when from the peopled streets  Where on Thame  s' banks I liv'd immur'd  The new blown fields that breath'd a thousand sweets  To Surry's woodcrown'd hills my steps allur'd  O happy hours beyond recovery fled  What share I now "that can your loss repay"  While o'er my mind these glooms of thought are spread  And veil the light of life's meridian ray  Is there no power this darkness to remove  The longlost joys of Eden to restore  Or raise our views to happier seats above  Where Fear and Pain and Death shall be no more  Yes those there are who know a Saviour's love  The longlost joys of Eden can restore  And raise their views to happier seats above  Where Fear and Pain and Death shall be no more  These grateful share the gift of Nature's hand  And in the varied scenes that round them shine  The Fair the Rich the Awful and the Grand  Admire th' amazing workmanship divine  Blows not a flow'ret in th' enamel'd vale  Shines not a pebble where the rivulet strays  Sports not an insect on the spicy gale  But claims their wonder and excites their praise  For them ev'n vernal nature looks more gay  For them more lively hues the fields adorn  To them more fair the fairest smile of day  To them more sweet the sweetest breath of morn  They feel the bliss that hope and faith supply  They pass serene th' appointed hours that bring  The day that wafts them to the realms on high  The day that centers in eternal spring  ELEGY  WRITTEN IN THE HOT WEATHER JULY MDCCLVII  BY THE SAME  THREE hours from noon the passing shadow shows  The sultry breeze glides faintly o'er the plains  The dazzling aether sierce and fiercer glows  And human nature scarce its rage sustains  Now still and vacant is the dusty street  And still and vacant where yon fields extend  Save where those swains oppress'd with toil and heat  The grassy harvest of the mead attend  Lost is the lively aspect of the ground  Low are the springs the reedy ditches dry  No verdant spot in all the vale is found  Save what yon stream's unfailing stores supply  Where are the flowers that made the garden gay  Where is their beauty where their fragrance sled  Their stems relax fast fall their leaves away  They fade and mingle with their dusty bed  All but the natives of the torrid zone  What Afric's wilds or Peru's fields display  Pleas'd with a clime that imitates their own  They lovelier bloom beneath the parching ray  Where is wild nature's heartreviving song  That fill'd in genial Spring the verdant bowers  Silent in gloomy woods the feather'd throng  Pine thro' this long long course of sultry hours  Where is the dream of bliss by Summer brought  The walk along the riv'letwater'd vale  The field with verdure clad with fragrance fraught  The sun mildbeaming and the fanning gale  The weary soul Imagination chears  Her pleasing colours paint the future gay  Time passes on the truth itself appears  The pleasing colours instant fade away  In different seasons different joys we place  And these shall Spring supply and Summer these  Yet frequent storms the bloom of Spring deface  And Summer scarcely brings a day to please  O for some secret shady cool recess  Some Gothic dome o'erhung with darksome trees  Where thick damp walls this raging heat repress  Where the long isle invites the lazy breeze  But why these plaintsamid his wastes of sand  Far more than this the wandering Arab feels  Far more the Indian in Columbus' land  While Phoebus o'er him rolls his fiery wheels  Far more the sensible of mind sustains  Rack'd with the poignant pangs of fear or shame  The hopeless lover bound in beauty's chains  And he whom envy robs of hardearn'd same  He who a father or a mother mourns  Or lovely consort lost in early bloom  He whom the dreaded rage of fever burns  Or slow disease leads lingering to the tomb  Lest man should sink beneath the present pain  Lest man should triumph in the present joy  For him th' unvarying "Laws of heaven ordain"  Hope in his ills and to his bliss alloy  Fierce and oppressive is the sun we share  Yet not unuseful to our humid soil  Hence shall our fruits a richer flavour bear  Hence shall our plains with riper harvests smile  Reflect and be contentfor mankind's good  Heaven gives the due degrees of drought or rain  Tomorrow ceaseless showers may swell the flood  Nor soon yon sun rise blazing fierce again  Ev'n now behold the grateful change at hand  Hark in the east loud blustering gales arise  Wide and more wide the darkening clouds expand  And distant lightnings flash along the skies  O in the awful concert of the storm  While hail and rain and wind and thunder join  Let the great Ruler's praise my song inform  Let wonder reverence gratitude be mine  ELEGY  WRITTEN IN THE HARVEST  BY THE SAME  FAREWEL the pleasant violetscanted shade  The primros'dhill and daisymantled mead  The furrow'd land with springing corn array'd  The sunny wall with bloomy branches spread  Farewel the bower with blushing roses gay  Farewel the fragrant trefoilpurpled field  Farewel the walk thro' rows of newmown hay  When evening breezes mingled odours yield  Farewel to thesenow round the lonely farms  Where jocund Plenty deigns to fix her seat  Th' autumnal landscape opening all its charms  Declares kind Nature's annual work compleat  In different parts what different views delight  Where on neat ridges waves the golden grain  Or where the bearded barley dazzling white  Spreads o'er the steepy slope or wide champain  The smile of Morning gleams along the hills  And wakeful Labour calls her sons abroad  They leave with chearful look their lowly vills  And bid the fields resign their ripen'd load  To various tasks address the rustic band  And here the scythe and there the sickle wield  Or rear the newbound sheaves along the land  Or range in heaps the produce of the field  Some build the shocks some load the spacious wains  Some lead to sheltering barns the fragrant corn  Some form tall ricks that towering o'er the plains  For many a mile the rural yards adorn  Th' inclosure gates thrown open all around  The stubble's peopled by the gleaning throng  The rattling car with verdant branches crown'd  And joyful swains that raise the clamorous song  Soon mark glad harvest o'erYe rural lords  Whose wild domains o'er Albion's isle extend  Think whose kind hand your annual wealth affords  And bid to heaven your grateful praise ascend  For tho' no gift spontaneous of the ground  Rose these fair crops that made your vallies smile  Tho' the blithe youth of every hamlet round  Pursued for these thro' many a day their toil  Yet what avail your labours or your cares  Can all your labours all your cares supply  Bright suns or softening showers or tepid airs  Or one indulgent influence of the sky  For Providence decrees that we obtain  With toil each blessing destin'd to our use  But means to teach us that our toil is vain  If he the bounty of his hand refuse  Yet Albion blame not what thy crime demands  While this sad truth the blushing muse betrays  More frequent echoes o'er thy harvest lands  The voice of riot than the voice of praise  Prolific tho' thy fields and mild thy clime  Know realms once fam'd for fields and climes as fair  Have fell the prey of famine war and time  And now no semblance of their glory bear  Ask Palesline proud Asia's early boast  Where now the groves that pour'd her wine and oil  Where the fair towns that crown'd her wealthy coast  Where the glad swains that till'd her fertile soil  Ask and behold and mourn her hapless fall  Where rose fair towns where wav'd the golden grain  Thron'd on the naked rock and mouldering wall  Pale Want and Ruin hold their dreary reign  Where Jordan's vallies smil'd in living green  Where Sharon's flowers disclos'd their varied hues  The wandering pilgrim views the alter'd scene  And drops the tear of pity as he views  Ask Grecia mourning o'er her ruin'd towers  Where now the prospects charm'd her bards of old  Her cornclad mountains and Elysian bowers  And silver streams thro' fragrant meadows roll'd  Where Freedom's praise along the vale was heard  And town to town return'd the favourite sound  Where patriot War her awful standard rear'd  And brav'd the millions Persia pour'd around  There Freedom's praise no more the valley chears  There patriot War no more her banner waves  Nor bard nor sage nor martial chief appears  But stern barbarians rule a land of slaves  Of mighty realms are such the poor remains  Of mighty realms that fell when mad with power  They lur'd each vice to revel on their plains  Each monster doom'd their offspring to devour  O Albion would'st thou shun their mournful fates  To shun their follies and their crimes be thine  And woo to linger in thy fair retreats  The radiant virtues progeny divine  Bright Truth the noblest of the sacred band  Sweet Peace whose brow no ruffling frown deforms  Fair Charity with ever open hand  And Courage smiling 'midst a thousand storms  O haste to grace our isle ye lovely train  So may the power whose hand all blessing yields  Give her fam'd glories ever to remain  And crown with annual wealth her laughing fields  ELEGY  WRITTEN AT THE APPROACH OF WINTER  BY THE SAME  THE sun far southward bends his annual way  The bleak northeast wind lays the forest bare  The fruit ungather'd quits the naked spray  And dreary Winter reigns o'er earth and air  No mark of vegetable life is seen  No bird to bird repeats his tuneful call  Save the dark leaves of some rude evergreen  Save the lone redbreast on the mossgrown wall  Where are the sprightly scenes by Spring supply'd  The Mayflower'd hedges scenting every breeze  The white flocks scattering o'er the mountain side  The woodlarks warbling on the blooming trees  Where is gay Summer's sportive insect train  That in green fields on painted pinions play'd  The herd at morn widepasturing o'er the plain  Or throag'd at noontide in the willow shade  Where is brown Autumn's evening mild and still  What time the ripen'd corn fresh fragrance yields  What time the village peoples all the hill  And loud shouts echo o'er the harvest fields  To former scenes our fancy thus returns  To former scenes that little pleas'd when here  Our Winter chills us and our Summer burns  Yet we dislike the changes of the year  To happier lands then restless fancy flies  Where Indian streams thro' green Savannahs flow  Where brighter suns and ever tranquil skies  Bid new fruits ripen and new flowrets blow  Let Truth these fairer happier lands survey  There half the year descends in watry storms  Or Nature sickens in the blaze of day  And one brown hue the sunburnt plain deforms  There oft as toiling in the mazy fields  Or homeward passing on the shadeless way  His joyless life the weary labourer yields  And instant drops beneath the deathful ray  Who dreams of nature free from nature's strife  Who dreams of constant happiness below  The hopeflush'd enterer on the stage of life  The youth to knowledge unchastis'd by woe  For me long toil'd on many a weary road  Led by false hope in search of many a joy  I find in earth's bleak clime no blest abode  No place no season sacred from annoy  For me while Winter rages round the plains  With his dark days I'll human life compare  Not those who fraught with clouds and winds and rains  Than this with pining pain and anxious care  O whence this wonderous turn of mind our fate  Whate'er the season or the place possest  We ever murmur at our present state  And yet the thought of parting breaks our rest  Why else when heard in evening's solemn gloom  Does the sad knell that sounding o'er the plain  Tolls some poor lifeless body to the tomb  Thus thrill my breast with melancholy pain  The voice of Reason echoes in my ear  Thus thou ere long must join thy kindred clay  No more these "nostrils breathe the vital air"  No more these eyelids open on the day  O Winter round me spread thy joyless reign  Thy threatning skies in dusky horrors drest  Of thy dread rage no longer I'll complain  Nor ask an Eden for a transient guest  Enough has heaven indulg'd of joy below  To tempt our tarriance in this lov'd retreat  Enough has heaven ordain'd of useful woe  To make us languish for a happier seat  There is who deems all climes all seasons fair  There is who knows no restless passion's strife  Contentment smiling at each idle care  Contentment thankful for the gift of life  She finds in Winter many a scene to please  The morning landscape fring'd with frostwork gay  The sun at noon seen thro' the leassess trees  The clear calm aether at the close of day  She marks th' advantage storms and clouds bestow  When blustering Caurus purisies the air  When moist Aquarius pours the fleecy snow  That makes th' impregnate glebe a richer harvest bear  She bids for all our grateful praise arise  To him whose mandate spake the world to form  Gave Spring's gay bloom and Summer's chearful skies  And Autumn's cornclad field and Winter's sounding storm  HYMN FROM PSALM VIII  BY THE SAME  ALmighty Power amazing are thy ways  Above our knowledge and above our praise  How all thy works thine excellence display  How fair how great how wonderful are they  Thy hand yon wideextended heaven uprais'd  Yon wideextended heaven with stars emblaz'd  Where each bright orb since Time his course begun  Has roll'd a mighty world or shin'd a sun  Stupendous thought how sinks all human race  A point an atom in the field of space  Yet ev'n to us O Lord thy care extends  Thy bounty feeds us and thy power defends  Yet ev'n to us as delegates of thee  Thou giv'st dominion over land and sea  Whate'er or walks on earth or flits in air  Whate'er of life the watry regions bear  All these are ours and for th' extensive claim  We owe due homage to thy sacred name  Almighty Power how wonderous are thy ways  How far above our knowledge and our praise  ODE ON THE APPROACH OF SUMMER  BY  HENCE ironscepter'd Winter haste  To bleak Siberian waste  Haste to thy polar solitude  Mid cataracts of ice  Whose torrents dumb are stretch'd in fragments rude  From many an airy precipice  Where ever beat by sleety showers  Thy gloomy Gothic castle towers  Amid whose howling iles and halls  Where no gay sunbeam paints the walls  On ebon throne thou lov'st to shroud  Thy brows in many a murky cloud  Ev'n now before the vernal heat  Sullen I see thy train retreat  Thy ruthless host stern Eurus guides  That on a ravenous tyger rides  Dimfigur'd on whose robe are shewn  Shipwrecks and villages o'erthrown  Grim Auster dropping all with dew  In mantle clad of watchet hue  And Cold like Zemblan savage seen  Still threatning with his arrows keen  And next in furry coat embost  With icicles his brother Frost  Winter farewel thy forests hoar  Thy frozen floods delight no more  Farewel the fields so bare and wild  But come thou rosecheek cherub mild  Sweetest Summer haste thee here  Once more to crown the gladden'd year  Thee April blithe as long of yore  Bermudas' lawns he frolick'd o'er  With muskye nectartrickling wing  In the new world's first dawning spring  To gather balm of choicest dews  And patterns fair of various hues  With which to paint in changeful dye  The youthful earth's embroidery  To cull the essence of rich smells  In which to dip his newborn bells  Thee as he skimm'd with pinions fleet  He found an infant smiling sweet  Where a tall citron's shade imbrown'd  The soft lap of the fragrant ground  There on an amaranthine bed  Thee with rare nectarine fruits he fed  Till soon beneath his forming care  You look'd a goddess debonair  And then he gave the blessed isle  Aye to be sway'd beneath thy smile  There plac'd thy green and grassy shrine  With myrtle bower'd and jessamine  And to thy care the task assign'd  With quickening hand and nurture kind  His roseate infantbirths to rear  Till Autumn's mellowing reign appear  Haste thee nymph and hand in hand  With thee lead a buxom band  Bring fantasticfooted Joy  With Sport that yellowtressed boy  Leisure that thro' the balmy sky  Chases a crimson butterfly  Bring Health that loves in early dawn  To meet the milkmaid on the lawn  Bring Pleasure rural nymph and Peace  Meek cottageloving shepherdess  And that sweet stripling Zephyr bring  Light and for ever on the wing  Bring the dear Muse that loves to lean  On river margins mossy green  But who is she that bears thy train  Pacing light the velvet plain  The pale pink binds her auburn hair  Her tresses flow with pastoral air  'Tis May the graceconsest she stands  By branch of hawthorn in her hands  Lo near her trip the lightsome dews  Their wings all ting'd in irishues  With whom the powers of Flora play  And paint with pansies all the way  Oft when thy season sweetest Queen  Has drest the groves in livery green  When in each fair and fertile field  Beauty begins her bower to build  While Evening veil'd in shadows brown  Puts her matronmantle on  And mists in spreading steams convey  More fresh the fumes of newshorn hay  Then Goddess guide my pilgrim feet  Contemplation hoar to meet  As slow he winds in museful mood  Near the rush'd marge of Cherwell's flood  Or o'er old Avon's magic edge  Whence Shakespeare cull'd the spiky sedge  All playful yet in years unripe  To frame a shrill and simple pipe  There thro' the dusk but dimly seen  Sweet evening objects intervene  His wattled cotes the shepherd plants  Beneath her elm the milkmaid chants  The woodman speeding home awaile  Rests him at a shady stile  Nor wants there fragrance to dispense  Refreshment o'er my soothed sense  Nor tangled woodbines balmy bloom  Nor grass besprent to breathe perfume  Nor lurking wildthyme's spicy sweet  To bathe in dew my roving feet  Nor wants there note of Philomel  Nor sound of distanttiakling bell  Nor lowings faint of herds remote  Nor mastiff's bark from bosom'd cott  Rustle the breezes lightly borne  Or deepembattled ears of corn  Round ancient elm with humming noise  Full loud the chafferswarms rejoice  Meantime a thousand dies invest  The ruby chambers of the west  That all aslant the village tower  A mild reflected radiance pour  While with the levelstreaming rays  Far seen its arched windows blaze  And the tall grove's green top is dight  In russet tints and gleams of light  So that the gay scene by degrees  Bathes my blithe heart in extasies  And Fancy to my ravish'd sight  Pourtrays her kindred visions bright  At length the parting light subdues  My soften'd soul to calmer views  And fainter shapes of pensive joy  As twilight dawns my mind employ  Till from the path I fondly stray  In musings lapt nor heed the way  Wandering thro' the landscape still  Till Melancholy has her fill  And on each mosswove border damp  The glowworm hangs his fairy lamp  But when the sun at noontide hour  Sits throned in his highest tower  Me heartrejoicing Goddess lead  To the tann'd haycock in the mead  To mix in rural mood among  The nymphs and swains a busy throng  Or as the tepid odours breathe  The russet piles to lean beneath  There as my listless limbs are thrown  On couch more soft than palace down  I listen to the busy sound  Of mirth and toil that hums around  And see the team shrilltinkling pass  Alternate o'er the furrow'd grass  But ever after summershower  When the bright sun's returning power  With laughing beam has chas'd the storm  And chear'd reviving Nature's form  By sweetbrier hedges bath'd in dew  Let me my wholesome path pursue  There issuing sorth the frequent snail  Wears the dank way with slimy trail  While as I walk from pearled bush  The sunny sparkling drop I brush  And all the landscape fair I view  Clad in robe of fresher hue  And so loud the blackbird sings  That far and near the valley rings  From shelter deep of shaggy rock  The shepherd drives his joyful flock  From bowering beech the mower blithe  With newborn vigour grasps the scythe  While o'er the smooth unbounded meads  His last faint gleam the rainbow spreads  But ever against restless heat  Bear me to the rockarch'd seat  O'er whose dim mouth an ivy'd oak  Hangs nodding from the lowbrow'd rock  Haunted by that chaste nymph alone  Whose waters cleave the smoothed stone  Which as they gush upon the ground  Still scatter misty dews around  A rustic wild grotesque alcove  Its side with mantling woodbines wove  Cool as the cave where Clio dwells  Whence Helicon's fresh fountain wells  Or noontide grott where Sylvan sleeps  In hoar Lycaeum's piny steeps  Me Goddess in such cavern lay  While all without is scorch'd in day  Sore sighs the weary swain beneath  His withering hawthorn on the heath  The drooping hedger wishes eve  In vain of labour short reprieve  Meantime on Afric's glowing sands  Smote with keen heat the traveller stands  Low sinks his heart while round his eye  Measures the scenes that boundless lie  Ne'er yet by foot of mortal worn  Where Thirst wan pilgrim walks forlorn  How does he wish some cooling wave  To slake his lips or limbs to lave  And thinks in every whisper low  He hears a bursting fountain flow  Or bear me to yon antique wood  Dim temple of sage Solitude  But still in Fancy's mirror sees  Some more romantic scene would please  There within a nook most dark  Where none my musing mood may mark  Let me in many a whisper'd rite  The Genius old of Greece invite  With that fair wreath my brows to bind  Which for his chosen imps he twin'd  Well nurtur'd in Pierian lore  On clear Ilissus' laureat shore  Till high on waving nest reclin'd  The raven wakes my tranced mind  Or to the forestfringed vale  Where widow'd turtles love to wail  Where cowslips clad in mantle meek  Nod their tall heads to breezes weak  In the midst with sedges grey  Crown'd a scant rivulet winds its way  And trembling thro' the weedy wreaths  Around an oozy freshness breathes  O'er the solitary green  Nor cott nor loitering hind is seen  Nor aught alarms the mute repose  Save that by fits an heifer lows  A scene might tempt some peaceful sage  To rear him a lone hermitage  Fit place his pensive eld might chuse  On Virtue's holy lore to muse  Yet still the sultry noon t' appease  Some more romantic scene might please  Or fairy bank or magic lawn  By Spenser's lavish pencil drawn  Or bower in Vallambrosa's shade  By legendary pens pourtray'd  Haste let me shroud from painful light  On that hoar hill's aërial height  In solemn state where waving wide  Thick pines with darkening umbrage hide  The rugged vaults and riven towers  Of that proud castle's painted bowers  Whence Hardyknute a baron bold  In Scotland's martial days of old  Descended from the stately feast  Begirt with many a warriorguest  To quell the pride of Norway's king  With quivering lance and twanging string  As thro' the caverns dim I wind  Might I that holy legend find  By fairies spelt in mystic rhymes  To teach enquiring later times  What open force or secret guile  Dash'd into dust the solemn pile  But when mild Morn in saffron stole  First issues from her eastern goal  Let not my due feet fail to climb  Some breezy summit's brow sublime  Whence Nature's universal face  Illumin'd smiles with newborn grace  The misty streams that wind below  With silversparkling lustre glow  The groves and castled cliffs appear  Invested all in radiance clear  O every villagecharm beneath  The smoke that mounts in azure wreath  O beauteous rural interchange  The simple spire and elmy grange  Content indulging blissful hours  Whistles o'er the fragrant flowers  And cattle rouz'd to pasture new  Shake jocund from their sides the dew  'Tis thou alone O Summer mild  Canst bid me carol woodnotes wild  Whene'er I view thy genial scenes  Thy waving woods embroider'd greens  What fires within my bosom wake  How glows my mind the reed to take  What charms like thine the muse can call  With whom 'tis youth and laughter all  With whom each field's a paradise  And all the globe a bower of bliss  With thee conversing all the day  I meditate my lightsome lay  These pedant cloisters let me leave  To breathe my votive song at eve  In valleys where mild whispers use  Of shade and stream to court the muse  While wandering o'er the brook's dim verge  I hear the stockdove's dying dirge  But when life's busier scene is o'er  And age shall give the tresses hoar  I'd fly soft Luxury's marble dome  And make an humble thatch my home  Which sloping hills around enclose  Where many a beech and brown oak grows  Beneath whose dark and branching bowers  Its tides a farfam'd river pours  By Nature's beauties taught to please  Sweet Tuseulane of rural ease  Still grot of Peace in lowly shed  Who loves to rest her gentle head  For not the scenes of Attic art  Can comfort care or soothe the heart  Nor burning cheek nor wakeful eye  For gold and Tyrian purple fly  Thither kind heaven in pity lent  Send me a little and content  The faithful friend and chearful night  The social scene of dear delight  The conscience pure the temper gay  The musing eve and idle day  Give me beneath cool shades to sit  Rapt with the charms of classic wit  To catch the bold heroic flame  That built immortal Graecia's fame  Nor let me fail meantime to raise  The solemn song to Britain's praise  To spurn the shepherd's simple reeds  And paint heroic ancient deeds  To chant fam'd Arthur's magic tale  And Edward stern in sable mail  Or wandering Brutus' lawless doom  Or brave Bonduca scourge of Rome  O ever to sweet poesie  Let me live true votary  She shall lead me by the hand  Queen of sweet smiles and solace bland  She from her precious stores shall shed  Ambrosial flowrets o'er my head  She from my tender youthful cheek  Can wipe with lenient finger meek  The secret and unpitied tear  Which still I drop in darkness drear  She shall be my blooming bride  With her as years successive glide  I'll hold divinest dalliance  For ever held in holy trance  TRUE BEAUTY  BY DR FORDYCE  THE diamond's and the ruby's blaze  Disputes the palm with

What every object round avows  What every act of Reason shews  An Allwise Deity  The clearest evidence contest  Divinely stampt on every breast  Since Time was taught to roll  In Error's gloomy coverts stray  From Truth's indisputable ray  Remote as pole from pole  So shuts the moping bird of night  Her feeble eyes against the light  That glads the chearful day  And when prevailing darkness reigns  Thro' groves obscene or dreary plains  She wings her dubious way  Consult the blue expanse on high  The blush that paints the morning sky  The cloud that nimbly rides  The orbs that mark with lustre bright  The spangled mantle of the night  Who there supreme resides  Question the gaudy flowers around  That scent the air or paint the ground  Whose influence they obey  Whose hand imparts the various dyes  At whose command they bud and rise  At whose command decay  Say ye on down or mountain steep  That stately tread or lowly creep  And ye aërial throng  That chear the woodland scene and fields  With vocal strains whose bounty yields  Or sustenance or song  Who in the ocean's waste domain  The tenants of the watry plain  With liberal hand supplies  The floods in icy fetters binds  Smooths the rough surge and lulls the winds  Or bids the tempest rise  Nature in every mystic scene  Declares a plastic Author's reign  Above the morning's wings  Beyond the sea's remotest tides  Beneath the Daedal earth resides  Th' Almighty King of Kings  ODE TO MELANCHOLY  BY THE SAME  REMOTE from those enchanting bowers  Where dance the nimblefooted hours  Where revels frantic Folly  To thee I bring the tribute tear  Visits the muse thy mansions drear  Heartsearching Melancholy  By thee inspir'd by Fancy led  Thy hallowed ground I seem to tread  Where o'er the joyless plain  The aether sheds its blackest hue  And here and there a lonely yew  Marks Melancholy's reign  Where chearful gales forget to blow  Pellucid currents cease to flow  The cloudcapt mountain's height  All avenues of the dreary way  Secures from each pervading ray  Of soulenlivening light  Where Grief sad social solace seeks  The rose has fled her meagre cheeks  And hollow is her eye  Care on her lap reclines his head  Whilst hovering round the restless bed  The wing'd chimeras fly  Rack'd with ideal tortures Spleen  A thousand fiends unknown unseen  With shadowy faulchions scare  This rends her breast that goads her sides  And every hag of Fancy rides  The phantom thro' the air  Hark softly stealing on the ear  The hollow sigh the dropping tear  The music of Despair  Not lovers sorrowmocking sighs  Or mimic Grief that melts the eyes  Of youthful widowed fair  Sorrows that orphan bosoms pierce  Pour'd o'er a tender parent's hearse  Snatch'd by unpitying fate  No fostering hand's kind solace nigh  Each summer friend with wayward eye  Surveys their helpless state  Thus the vague group of vernal flies  While Titan gilds the cloudless skies  Sport in the glistening ray  The spiendid scene once overcast  By lowering cloud or adverse blast  Each insect veers away  When Pleasure's madding tide o'erswells  The rapt breast to those doleful cells  Of misery let me stray  There shall thoughtfostering Solitude  Whilst no fantastic joys intrude  Each devious step recal to Virtue's rugged way  ODE ON ENVY  BY THE SAME  I  BENEATH yon chain of barren rocks  Where niggard Nature ne'er unlocks  One hoard of chearful green  The brown yew forms a gloomy shade  The blasted oak erects its head  A dreary wasteful scene  O haste O fly th' accursed cell  Where Envy's fiendly faction dwell  Else shall her glance malignant cast  The fairest shoots of Merit blast  He risks his ease who ventures nigh  The baleful witchcraft of her eye  II  Ev'n now from her infernal dark abyss  At Merit's name she lifts her head  At Merit's name prepar'd to shed  Their influence all her snaky tresses hiss  Ev'n now the languid mind opprest  Droops under horrors damp and chill  Whilst heaves the sigh from the distended breast  Slow winds the tide of life along each azure rill  Arise my Muse the chorded shell prepare  Awake the drowsy string  For thou canst lull the gathering storms of Care  Thou canst disarm dire Envy of her sting  And smooth the haggard brow of fell Despair  III  Ah strange reverse of honest joys  The paleey'd fiend elate  Smiles if Adversity annoys  Her neighbour's hapless state  Yet Spleen oppressive marrs her chear  And signs the bitter day  For Envy drops the scalding tear  When all the world is gay  The tenant of some narrow mind  She bids Suspicion launch the dart  Whilst all her secret powers combin'd  Excite the poignant smart  Slow halts Illnature in the rear  That poisons as she probes the wound  And Rumour's noisome breath is near  To wast the poison round  I  Say Theron yet shall torpid Fear  Obstruct thy virtue's high career  Shall Envy's menace wrest  Thy merit's welldirected aim  And quench the noble thirst of fame  That warms thy youthful breast  O no pursue the glorious road  A Bacon Hide and Osborne trod  Her snaky head tho' Envy rear  Fame's eagle wing thy name shall bear  O'er black Oblivion's frozen sea  Rank'd with great chiefs of old in immortality  ODE TO HEALTH  BY THE SAME  HENCE meagre pale Disease  From the crude banquets of Intemperance bred  Nurs'd in the sluggard bed  And folded in the arms of pamper'd Ease  Hence to Boeotian bogs  Whence humid Auster on his dropping wings  Gross exhalations brings  Where rank effluvia from the marshy brake  Or murky stagnate lake  Pregnant with ills arise in misty fogs  And come Hygeia bland and fair  Flush'd with the glow of morning air  With coral lip and sparkling eye  Complexion of ensanguin'd dye  With chearful smile and open brow  Where Care could ne'er one surrow plow  With steady step and aspect sleek  The rose that glows on Stella's cheek  And snowy bosom whence exhales  The sweetness of Etesian gales  In sylvan scenes is thy delight  To climb the towering mountain's height  Or blithely on thy native plain  To gambol with the Dryad train  Those plains where in unguarded hour  Far from the ken of her chaste bower  As o'er the dewbespangled glade  Rov'd Temperance the mountain maid  She stopt in fixt attention viewing  Lusty Exercise pursuing  With missive shaft and beechen spear  Thro' opening lawns the trembling deer  The God surveys the musing dame  The lover quits his flying game  His tresses dropp'd with morning dew  While to the woodnymph's arms he flew  And from their hale embraces sprung  Hygeia ever fair and young  Long virgin may thy genial fire  Each late exhausted vein inspire  The crimson tide of life renew  And give to glide in channels blue  Thee Wit and Mirth spontaneous serve  That give a tone to every nerve  Invoke thee Harmony's bright Queen  To tune the disarrang'd machine  The glow of Titan's orient ray  Thy happy pencil shall pourtray  With grace more exquisite than lies  In Guido's air or Titian's dyes  Hence the pale hue of Sickness chase  And call up each reviving grace  O'er which as late with haggard hand  Consumption shook her magic wand  Nature's last debt prepar'd to pay  Youth's drooping flowers 'gan fade away  No crimson hue was seen to glow  The stagnate blood forgot to flow  Their lustre fled the languid eyes  Stood fixt in motionless surprise  Each sense seem'd lost in endless night  The trembling soul was wing'd for flight  Which Death's rude shaft had half set free  In unconceiv'd eternity  Then Varus was the power display'd  Of medicine's heavendirected aid  Vers'd in each drug's balsamic use  The Daedal soils of earth produce  In every flower of every hue  And herb that drinks the morning dew  Thy lenient hand allay'd each throw  And gave a milder face to Woe  Bade the bold pulse elastic play  The eye emit its vivid ray  Call'd back the flitting life again  And Health inspir'd thro' every vein  Again thrills with her genial zest  Each nerve again my languid breast  Visits the cherub Joy For this  May thy auspicious heart ne'er miss  Oft as the fair for charms decay'd  Implores thy salutary aid  To smooth the lovely mourner's brow  And bid reviving beauties glow  To soothe the tender parent's cries  And wipe the tears from infant eyes  But chief my Muse with reverent awe  To Him whose will is Nature's law  Thy hymns of gratulation pay  To Him direct the tribute lay  From whom derives the balmy pill  Its virtues the physician skill  That o'er each act and thought presides  Directs his hand his counsel guides  Else medicine's unavailing store  Shall vainly glide thro' every pore  Thro' every pore the mineral rill  In vain its gifted powers instill  Father Divine Eternal King  To thee I wake the trembling string  If mad Ambition ne'er misled  In paths where Virtue dares not tread  My vagrant step if sordid views  Ne'er won the prostituted Muse  For others let Pactolus flow  Let Honour wreathe another's brow  Health I intreat whose jocund throng  Wantons each laughing grace among  With Health the dancing minutes crown'd  The field of all my wishes bound  PRAYER FOR INDIFFERENCE  BY MRS GREVILLE  OFT I've implor'd the gods in vain  And pray'd till I've been weary  For once I'll seek my wish to gain  Of Oberon the fairy  Sweet airy Being wanton Spright  Who liv'st in woods unseen  And oft by Cynthia's silver light  Trip'st gaily o'er the green  If e'er thy pitying heart was mov'd  As ancient stories tell  And for  See Midsummer night's dream  th' Athenian maid who lov'd  Thou sought'st a wondrous spell  O deign once more t' exert thy power  Haply some herb or tree  Sovereign as juice from western flower  Ibid    Conceals a balm for me  I ask no kind return in love  No tempting charm to please  Far from the heart such gifts remove  That sighs for peace and ease  Nor ease nor peace that heart can know  That like the needle true  Turns at the touch of joy or woe  But turning trembles too  Far as distress the soul can wound  'Tis pain in each degree  'Tis bliss but to a certain bound  Beyondis agony  Then take this treacherous sense of mine  Which dooms me still to smart  Which pleasure can to pain refine  To pain new pangs impart  O haste to shed the sovereign balm  My shatter'd nerves newstring  And for my guest serenely calm  The nymph Indifference bring  At her approach see Hope see Fear  See Expectation fly  And Disappointment in the rear  That blasts the purpos'd joy  The tears which Pity taught to flow  My eyes shall then disown  The heart that throbb'd at others woe  Shall then scarce feel its own  The wounds which now each moment bleed  Each moment then shall close  And tranquil days shall still succeed  To nights of sweet repose  O fairyelf but grant me this  This one kind comfort send  And so may neverfading bliss  Thy flowery paths attend  So may the glowworm's glimmering light  Thy tiny footsteps lead  To some new region of delight  Unknown to mortal tread  And by thy acorn goblet fill'd  With heaven's ambrosial dew  From sweetest freshest flowers distill'd  That shed fresh sweets for you  And what of life remains for me  I'll pass in sober ease  Halfpleas'd contented will I be  Contentbut half to please  THE FAIRY'S ANSWER TO MRS GREVILLE  BY THE COUNTESS OF C  WITHOUT preamble to my friend  These hasty lines I'm bid to send  Or give if I am able  I dare not hesitate to say  Tho' I have trembled all the day  It looks so like a fable  Last night's adventure is my theme  And should it strike you as a dream  Yet soon its high import  Must make you own the matter such  So delicate it were too much  To be compos'd in sport  The moon did shine serenely bright  And every star did deck the night  While Zephyr fann'd the trees  No more assail'd my mind's repose  Save that yon stream which murmuring flows  Did echo to the breeze  Enwrapt in solemn thoughts I sate  Revolving o'er the turns of fate  Yet void of hope or fear  When lo behold an aëry throng  With lightest steps and jocund song  Surpriz'd my eye and ear  A form superior to the rest  His little voice to me addrest  And gently thus began  " I've heard strange things from one of you  " Pray tell me if you think 'tis true  " Explain it if you can  " Such incense has perfum'd my throne  " Such eloquence my heart has won  " I think I guess the hand  " I know her wit and beauty too  " But why she sends a prayer so new  " I cannot understand  " To light some flames and some revive  " To keep some others just alive  " Full oft I am implor'd  " But with peculiar power to please  " To supplicate for nought but ease  " 'Tis odd upon my word  " Tell her with fruitless care I've sought  " And tho' my realms with wonders fraught  " In remedies abound  " No grain of cold Indifference  " Was ever yet ally'd to Sense  " In all my fairy round  " The regions of the sky I'd trace  " I'd ransack every earthly place  " Each leaf each herb each flower  " To mitigate the pangs of Fear  " Dispel the clouds of black Despair  " Or lull the restless hour  " I would be generous as I'm just  " But I obey as others must  " Those laws which Fate has made  " My tiny kingdom how defend  " And what might be the horrid end  " Should Man my state invade  " 'Twould put your mind into a rage  " And such unequal war to wage  " Suits not my regal duty  " I dare not change a first decree  " She's doom'd to please nor can be free  " Such is the lot of Beauty"  This said he darted o'er the plain  And after follow'd all his train  No glimpse of him I find  But sure I am the little spright  These words before he took his flight  Imprinted on my mind  THE MAN OF SORROW  BY MR GREVILLE  AH what avails the lengthening mead  By Nature's kindest bounty spread  Along the vale of flowers  Ah what avails the darkening grove  Or Philomel's melodious love  That glads the midnight hours  For me alas the god of day  Ne'er glitters on the hawthorn spray  Nor night her comfort brings  I have no pleasure in the rose  For me no vernal beauty blows  Nor Philomela sings  See how the sturdy peasants stride  Adown yon hillock's verdant side  In chearful ignorance blest  Alike to them the rose or thorn  Alike arises every morn  By gay Contentment drest  Content fair daughter of the skies  Or gives spontaneous or denies  Her choice divinely free  She visits oft the hamletcot  When Want and Sorrow are the lot  Of Avarice and me  But seeor is it Fancy's dream  Methought a bright celestial gleam  Shot sudden thro' the groves  Behold behold in loose array  Euphrosyne more bright than day  More mild than Paphian doves  Welcome O welcome Pleasure's queen  And see along the velvet green  The jocund train advance  With scatter'd flowers they fill the air  The woodnymph's dewbespangled hair  Plays in the sportive dance  Ah baneful grant of angry heaven  When to the feeling wretch is given  A soul alive to joy  Joys fly with every hour away  And leave th' unguarded heart a prey  To cares that Peace destroy  And see with visionary haste  Too soon the gay delusion past  Reality remains  Despair has seiz'd my captive soul  And Horror drives without controul  And slackens still the reins  Ten thousand beauties round me throng  What beauties say ye nymphs belong  To the distemper'd soul  I see the lawn of hideous dye  The towering elm nods misery  With groans the waters roll  Ye gilded roofs Palladian domes  Ye vivid tints of Persia's looms  Ye were for misery made  'Twas thus the Man of Sorrow spoke  His wayward step then pensive took  Along th' unhailow'd shade  THE MAN OF PLEASURE  BY THE SAME  YES to the Sages be it told  However great or wise or old  Fair Pleasure's my pursuit  For her I breathe the joyful day  For her thro' Nature's wilds I stray  And cull the flowers and fruit  Sweep sweep the lute's enchanting string  And all thy sweets lov'd Luxury bring  " To enjoy is to obey"  The heavenly mandate still prevail  And let each unwise wretch bewail  The dire neglected day  Ah graceless wretch to disobey  And devious quit the flowery way  And slight the gods decree  Still still ye gods the blessings send  If e'er my guilty hands offend  Indeed my heart is free  In Pleasure's ray see Nature shine  How dull alas at Wisdom's shrine  " 'Tis Folly to be wise"  Collusive term poor vain pretence  Enjoyment sure is real Sense  In philosophic eyes  I love the carol of the hound  Enraptur'd on the living ground  In dashing ecstasy  I love the aukward courser's stride  The courser that has been well tried  And with him eager fly  And yes I love ye sneering wise  Fair Honour spurning still at lies  As courting Liberty  Still hand in hand great Nature goes  With joys to honour never foes  And all those joys are free  And welcome thrice to British land  From Italy's voluptuous strand  Ye destin'd men of art  Breathe on the thrilling meaning sound  Each grace shall still be faithful found  At your admirer's heart  Avert ye gods that curse of fools  The pride of theoretic rules  That dupery of sense  I ne'er refuse the proffer'd joy  With every goodthat can annoy  Most easily dispense  I catch each rapture as it flies  Each happy loss a gain supplies  And boon still follows boon  The smile of beauty gilds my day  Regardless of her frowns I stray  Thus thro' my hours I run  But let me not for idle rhyme  Neglect ungrateful good old Time  Dear watch thou art obey'd  'Twas thus the Man of Pleasure spoke  His jovial step then careless took  To Celiaor her maid  VERSES SENT BY LORD MELCOMBE TO DR YOUNG NOT LONG BEFORE HIS LORDSHIP'S DEATH  KIND companion of my youth  Lov'd for genius worth and truth  Take what friendship can impart  Tribute of a feeling heart  Take the muse's latest spark  Ere we drop into the dark  He who parts and virtue gave  Bade thee look beyond the grave  Genius soars and virtue guides  Where the love of God presides  There's a gulph 'twixt us and God  Let the gloomy path be trod  Why stand shivering on the shore  Why not boldly venture o'er  Where unerring virtue guides  Let us brave the winds and tides  Safe thro' seas of doubts and fears  Rides the bark which virtue steers  VERSES UNDER THE BUSTO OF COMUS IN A BUFFET AT HAMMERSMITH  E AUGUST MDCCL  BY THE SAME  WHILE rosy wreaths the goblet deck  Thus Comus spoke or seem'd to speak  " This place for social hours design'd  " May Care and Business never find  " Come every Muse without restraint  " Let Genius prompt and Fancy paint  " Let Wit and Mirth with friendly strife  " Chase the dull gloom that saddens life  " True Wit that firm to Virtue's cause  " Respects religion and the laws  " True Mirth that chearfulness supplies  " To modest ears and decent eyes  " Let these indulge their liveliest sallies  " Both scorn the canker'd help of Malice  " True to their country and their friend  " Both scorn to flatter or offend"  PROLOGUE SPOKEN BY MR GARRICK APRIL V MDCCL BEFORE THE MASQUE OF COMUS ACTED AT DRURYLANE FOR THE BENEFIT OF MILTON'S GRANDDAUGHTER  BY SAMUEL JOHNSON LLD  YE patriot crowds who burn for England's fame  Ye nymphs whose bosoms beat at Milton's name  Whose generous zeal unbought by flattering rhymes  Shames the mean pensions of Augustan times  Immortal patrons of succeeding days  Attend this prelude of perpetual praise  Let Wit condemn'd the feeble war to wage  With close Malevolence or public Rage  Let Study worn with Virtue's fruitless lore  Behold this theatre and grieve no more  This night distinguish'd by your smile shall tell  That never Briton can in vain excel  The slighted arts futurity shall trust  And rising ages hasten to be just  At length our mighty bard's victorious lays  Fill the loud voice of universal praise  And baffled Spite with hopeless anguish dumb  Yields to Renown the centuries to come  With ardent haste each candidate of Fame  Ambitious catches at his towering name  He sees and pitying sees vain Wealth bestow  Those pageant honours which he scorn'd below  While crowds aloft the laureat bust behold  Or trace his form on circulating gold  Unknown unheeded long his offspring lay  And Want hung threatening o'er her slow decay  What tho' she shine with no Miltonian fire  No favouring muse her morning dreams inspire  Yet softer claims the melting heart engage  Her youth laborious and her blameless age  Her's the mild merits of domestic life  The patient sufferer and the faithful wise  Thus grac'd with humble Virtue's native charms  Her grandsire leaves her in Britannia's arms  Secure with peace with competence to dwell  While tutelary nations guard her cell  Yours is the charge ye fair ye wise ye brave  'Tis yours to crown desertbeyond the grave  THE 'SQUIRE AND THE PARSON AN ECLOGUE  BY S J ESQ  BY his hall chimney where in rusty grate  Green faggots wept their own untimely fate  In elbowchair the pensive 'Squire reclin'd  Revolving debts and taxes in his mind  A pipe just fill'd upon a table near  Lay by the London Evening stain'd with beer  With half a bible on whose remnants torn  Each parish round was annually forsworn  The gate now claps as Evening just grew dark  Tray starts and with a growl prepares to bark  But soon discerning with sagacious nose  The well known savour of the Parson's toes  Lays down his head and sinks in soft repose  The Doctor entering to the tankard ran  Takes a good hearty pull and thus began  PARSON  Why sit'st thou thus forlorn and dull my friend  Now War's rapacious reign is at an end  Hark how the distant bells inspire delight  See bonfires spangle o'er the veil of night  'SQUIRE  What's Peace alas in foreign parts to me  At home nor peace nor plenty can I see  Joyless I hear drums bells and fiddles sound  'Tis all the sameFour shillings in the pound  My wheels tho' old are clogg'd with a new tax  My oaks tho' young must groan beneath the axe  My barns are half unthatch'd until'd my house  Lost by this fatal sickness all my cows  See there's the bill my late damn'd lawsuit cost  Long as the land contended forand lost  Ev'n Ormond's Head I can frequent no more  So short my pocket is so long the score  At shops all round I owe for fifty things  This comes of fetching Hanoverian kings  PARSON  I must confess the times are bad indeed  No wonder when we scarce believe our creed  When purblind Reason's deem'd the surest guide  And heavenborn Faith at her tribunal try'd  When all churchpower is thought to make men slaves  Saints martyrs fathers all call'd fools and knaves  'SQUIRE  Come preach no more but drink and hold your tongue  I'm for the churchbut think the parsons wrong  PARSON  See there Freethinking now so rank is grown  It spreads infection thro' each country town  Deistic scoffs fly round at rural boards  'Squires and their tenants too profane as lords  Vent impious jokes on every sacred thing  'SQUIRE  Come drink  PARSON  Here's to you then to church and king  'SQUIRE  Here's church and king I hate the glass should stand  Tho' one takes tithes and t'other taxes land  PARSON  Heaven with new plagues will scourge this sinful nation  Unless we soon repeal the toleration  And to the church restore the convocation  'SQUIRE  Plagues we should feel sufficient on my word  Starv'd by two houses priestrid by a third  For better days we lately had a chance  Had not the honest Plaids been trick'd by France  PARSON  Is not most gracious George our faith's defender  You love the church yet wish for the pretender  'SQUIRE  Preferment I suppose is what you mean  Turn Whig and you perhaps may be a Dean  But you must first learn how to treat your betters  What's here sure some strange news a boy with letters  O ho here's one I see from Parson Sly  " My reverend neighbour Squab being like to die  " I hope if heaven should please to take him hence  " To ask the living would be no offence  PARSON  Have you not swore that I should Squab succeed  Think how for this I taught your sons to read  How oft discover'd puss on newplow'd land  How oft supported you with friendly hand  When I could scarcely go nor could your worship stand  'SQUIRE  'Twas yours had you been honest wise or civil  Now ev'n go court the Bishopsor the Devil  PARSON  If I meant any thing now let me die  I'm blunt and cannot fawn and cant not I  Like that old presbyterian rascal Sly  I am you know a right truehearted Tory  Love a good glass a merry song or story  'SQUIRE  Thou art an honest dog that's truth indeed  Talk no more nonsense then about the creed  I can't I think deny thy first request  'Tis thine but first a bumper to the best  PARSON  Most noble 'Squire more generous than your wine  How pleasing's the condition you assign  Give me the sparkling glass and here d'ye see  With joy I drink it on my bended knee  Great Queen who governest this earthly ball  And mak'st both kings and kingdoms rise and fall  Whose wonderous power in secret all things rules  Makes fools of mighty peers and peers of fools  Dispenses mitres coronets and stars  Involves far distant realms in bloody wars  Then bids the snaky tresses cease to hiss  And gives them peace again  Madam de Pmpdour  nay gav'st us this  Whose health does health to all mankind impart  Here's to thy muchloy'd health  'SQUIRE rubbing his hands  With all my heart  ALLEN AND ELLA A FRAGMENT  BY  ON the banks of that crystalline stream  Where Thames oft his current delays  And charms more than poets can dream  In his Richmond's bright villa surveys  Fair Ella of all the gay throng  The fairest that Nature had seen  Now drew every village along  From the day she first danc'd on the green  Ah boast not of beauty's fond power  For short is the triumph ye fair  Not fleeter the bloom of each flower  And hope is but gilded despair  His affection each swain now behold  By riches endeavours to prove  But Ella still cries what is gold  Or wealth when compar'd to his love  Yes Allen together we'll wield  Our sickles in summer's bright day  Together we'll lease o'er the field  And smile all our labours away  In winter I'll winnow the wheat  As it falls from thy flail on the ground  That flail will be music as sweet  When thy voice in the labour is drown'd  How oft would he speak of his bliss  How oft would he call her his maid  And Allen would seal with a kiss  Every promise and vow that he said  But hark o'er the grasslevel  The village of Petersham  land  The village bells sound on the plain  False Allen this morn gave his hand  And Ella's sond tears are in vain  Sad Ella too soon heard the tale  Too soon the sad cause she was told  That his was a nymph of the vale  That he broke his sond promise for gold  As she walk'd by the margin so green  Which befringes the sweet river's side  How oft' was she languishing seen  How oft' would she gaze on the tide  By the clear river then as she sate  Which reflected herself and the mead  Awhile she bewept her sad fate  And the green turf still pillow'd her head  There there is it Ella I see  'Tis Ella the lost undone maid  Ah no 'tis some Ella like me  Some hapless young virgin betray'd  Like me she has sorrow'd and wept  Like me she has fondly believ'd  Like me her true promise she kept  And like me too is justly deceiv'd  I come dear companion in grief  Gay scenes and fond pleasures adieu  I come and we'll gather relief  From bosoms so chaste and so true  Like you I have mourn'd the long night  And wept out the day in despair  Like you I have banish'd delight  And bosom'd a friend in my care  Ye meadows so lovely farewel  Your velvet still Allen shall tread  All deaf to the sound of that knell  Which tolls for his Ella when dead  Your wish will too sure be obey'd  Nor Allen her loss shall bemoan  Soon soon shall poor Ella be laid  Where her heart shall be cold as your own  Then twin'd in the arms of that fair  Whose wealth has been Ella's sad fate  As together ye draw the free air  And a thousand dear pleasures relate  If chance o'er my turf as ye tread  Ye dare to affect a fond sigh  The primrose will shrink her pale head  And the violet languish and die  Ah weep not fond maid 'tis in vain  Like the tears which you lend to the stream  Tears are lost in that watery plain  And your sighs are still lost upon him  Scarce echo had gather'd the sound  But she plung'd from her grassspringing bed  The liquid stream parts to the ground  And the mirror clos'd over her head  The swains of the village at eve  Oft meet at the darkspreading yew  There wonder how man could deceive  A bosom so chaste and so true  With garlands of every flower  Which Ella herself should have made  They raise up a shortliving bower  And sighing cry "Peace to her shade"  Then handlock'dinhand as they move  The greenplatting hillock around  They talk of poor Ella and love  And freshen with tears the fair ground  Nay wish they had never been born  Or liv'd the sad moment to view  When her Allen could thus be forsworn  And his Ella could still be so true
