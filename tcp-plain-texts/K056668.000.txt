 A Further Search INTO THE  CONDUCT  OF THE ALLIES AND THE  Late Ministry  AS TO  Peace  and  War  Containing also A Reply to the several LETTERS and MEMORIALS of the  StatesGeneral  WITH A Vindication of the  British  Parliament in their late Resolves and Address relating to the Deficiencies of the  DUTCH  LONDON  Printed for  John Morphew  near  StationersHall    A Further Search INTO THE CONDUCT OF THE ALLIES  c  THE Reception a former Work of this Kind has met with in the World and the little which has been said against it as to Matters of Fact must be acknowledged to be all owing to the Truth coming with an irresistible Force upon the Minds of Men and which always carries its own Evidence along with it when we have met with the Enemy descanting upon it we have  heard them even in the midst of a Thousand Curses and hard Names which they cast upon the Author yet at every Pause cry out  Damn the Circumstance  I doubt there is too much Truth in it tho' I hate the Design of making it Publick This makes it clear which has often and upon many other Occasions been said that our late People had a kind of Popery in their Politicks  viz  that much of their Success consisted in keeping the People Blind and Ignorant in the Main and most Essential Points of their Affairs and which it was most necessary for them to know that they were so far from knowing what Usage they had received Abroad from their Allies that when they came to be a little rightly inform'd they could not Frame Idea's of so much Knavery in their Heads or think it possible that any People who called themselves Allies could at the same time carry themselves in such a Manner to those for whom they had made the least Professions of any Respect or for whose common Safety they had the least Concern  As the Truth of what has been thus spoken is hereby acknowledged and confest by the Enemy which is the best kind of Evidence so the Seasonableness of making that Truth Publick in the Manner it hath been by the former Tract and as it shall or may be in this is justified  and clear'd beyond all Possibility of Objection by the late Publick Resolutions of the Honourable House of Commons where it comes into the World with the Sanction and Authority of the great Representative of the Nation it is true the Particulars in the Votes amount to a most excessive Height and tho' it was known and believed by many to be very great yet I must confess few imagined them to be so surprizing the Account so large and the Particulars so many as they appear to be also one Thing is obtain'd by this Report of the House of Commons which the Credit of a single Author was by no Means sufficient for  viz  that the  Dutch  had any Share in the Deficiency and in the Injuries which this Nation has suffered under the Weight of this Confederacy many would be brought by the Power of Reasoning and the Force of Demonstrations which are Things all People are not equally furnished to resist they would I say be brought to confess that there might have been Defects in general and that those Defects appeared in the Affairs of the Empire the  Portuguese  and such like any Thing but the  Dutch  but such an Ascendant had the Influence of the Politicks and the Confederacy of the late Administration with the Parties concern'd obtain'd over the People that tho' any thing would go down with them against other  People yet if the Dear  Dutch  came into the Dispute nothing could be born with but all the rest was the pure Effect of Jacobitism and the  French  How fatal this has been to us I may hereafter have Leisure to examine and every Day is like to discover more and more of it to us indeed Things were mounted to such a violent Prepossession upon us in Favour of the  Dutch  that we began to think even our own Constitution stood in need of further Security from them and politickly brought the  Dutch  into our National Concerns thus making ourselves beholden to them for a Guarantee or Safety to the Succession of  Hannover  that this might be a Handle to our doing other Things for them so exorbitant in their own Nature as that no Nation but such as depended upon them for something very weighty and significant would ever consent to or could upon any other Pretence be perswaded into yet this was not all for when we had brought our People to stoop to so mean a Thought as that our Succession Ratified by both Kingdoms and Incorporated by both the Parliaments of  England  and  Scotland  in the late Solemn Treaty of Union could receive any Addition of Strength from Abroad more than that of the Interest and Alliance of so powerful a Prince as his Electoral Highness of  Hannover  and his Allies that we  stood in Need of that incoherent Article of a  Dutch  Guarantee when I say we had stoop'd so low as to level our Constitution to the Common Notion of Leagues and Treaties between other and differing Nations and that it should receive a farther Sanction thereby it was not hard then to fill the Heads of the poor People with a Belief that whoever made the least Objection against any Thing hereafter which either the  Dutch  might do by us or which we might do by them acted therein against the Protestant Succession This was a Point so well gain'd by the  Dutch  that on the Faith of a Man if they gain'd it for nothing it was the best Bargain they made during the whole War and if our late Managers granted it so also they must either have given up their Sences to the  Dutch  or had most despicable Thoughts of the Strength of  GreatBritain  and of our being able to support our own Settlement or which I speak most unwillingly there must have been some private Bargain driven of which I shall venture to say no more but that I hope no  Englishman  could be found that would be guilty of it  To wave therefore a Reflection so unwelcome let us go back to the Observation before  viz  this Threefold End we have seen it answer to the  Dutch  what End it will ever answer to us remains a Mystery and will in all Probability remain so for  many Years to come if not for ever the Ends which I say it answered for the  Dutch  were Three  The Barrier Treaty which with the separate Article was join'd as the Advance Money of a Loan by Way of what our People call PromptPayment and which the  Dutch  had the Confidence to Paum upon us as a small Matter and a Thing due to them for the great Kindness done for us by them in taking upon them to secure our Succession I am not ignorant of that weak and foolish Use which the Enemies of Peace made of that Objection spoken of in the other foremention'd Tract p  viz  "That it may not be right in Point of Policy or good Sense that a Foreign Power should be call'd in to confirm our Succession by Way of Guarantee but only to acknoledge it otherwise we put it out of the Power of our own Legislature to change our Succession without the Consent of that Prince or State who is Guarantee However our Posterity may hereafter by the Tyranny and Oppression of any succeeding Princes be reduced to the Fatal Necessity of breaking in upon the Excellent and Happy Settlement now in Force"  This by all Means they will have as an Aim taken for the Pretender as if because we ought not to put it out of the  Power of our Legislature to limit the Succession whatever Necessity may happen even when this Race may be all in their Graves that therefore we have an immediate Alteration of the Succession in our View these People who contend thus forget the mighty Noise we have had from them about  Parliamentary Limitations  a Word the Whigs have made so Sacred that it has been like the  Magna Charta  of their Liberties and with which they run down the Hereditary Right of their Princes as if there had been nothing at all in it but Tyranny and Arbitrary Government till at Length it was happily discovered that they were very well consistent together and that they who best understood Hereditary Right had proved it to be agreeable to Parliamentary Limitation and then all was well again But after all this Bustle was it to be imagined that the same People could so easily give up the Parliaments Right of limiting the Succession to a Foreign Nation and by making a League of Guarantee for the Succession legitimate the Impertinence of Strangers who may hereafter intermeddle with our Constitution and may tell a  British  Parliament they have no Power to alter or meddle with the Settlement of the Crown for that it is already Settled and they are Guarantees of it What has been may be and what may be may be supposed to be if then any of  the Family of  Hannover  should Tyrannize or Abdicate or the same or like Circumstances should happen as have happened before the Parliament would be disabled from declaring the Throne vacant and filling up the same with such other of the Family as they find convenient which according to all the Whig Principles which we have so often heard of is inseparable from the Constitution and much more Sacred than any Thing which has been Hereditary in the World I do not encline to concern these Papers with the popular Disputes which have troubled the World so much and so long about the Difference between Hereditary and Parliamentary Right how far they are the same or which is best furnished with Authorities and Originals whether of Divine or Civil Right it is enough to take hold here of the Whigs own Argument and allowing all they have said on this Head to be Orthodox whether it really be so or no it must necessarily follow that this Parliamentary Right cannot or ought not to be given out of our Hinds and put by a Treaty into the Hands of Foreigners so that it shall be in their Power to put their Negative into our next Limitation of the Crown If this be not to give away our Liberties I would be glad to know what it is to keep them if there be any Choice of Tyrants and if it weighs any Thing when our Priviledges are given  up who is it they should be given up to I confess myself more willing to be a Slave at Home than Abroad and to be tyranniz'd on by a Prince of our own than by a Foreign Nation and if there were no other Reason for that than this it would be sufficient to justifie the Choice  viz  that there are more Ways to avoid the Mischief of it that an oppressing Prince has some times chang'd his Measures or he may be restrain'd or may die and thereby a Nation may be delivered but such a Convention as this made with a Foreign Nation engages that whole Nation upon all Occasions to embark itself and its whole Strength in Defence of the Capitulation agreed on and thus by this Method the Power of Parliament in future Limitations of the Crown seems to be effectually given up How the Whigs would have liked this Doctrine if it had come from any one but themselves may be best guess'd at by the Warmth they shewed about the League said to be made by the late King  James  and the King of  France  which put this whole Nation into a Flame and Reason good so far as that League appear'd for what was it or what could we imagine it to be but a Treaty of Guarantee with the  French  for the securing the Succession of Popery in  England  Whereas the Settling the Religion and Liberties of this Nation was the undoubted Right of the People in Parliament and so  by the same Rule must the Succession of our Princes be The Sum of all this is that by the Whigs own Arguments and by their own Principles which they have always professed and adher'd to and by the same Rule from which they acted in the Revolution the accepting a Guarantee for the securing the Succession of the Crown of this Kingdom to any Family or Branch of a Family Race or Line whatsoever is no less than giving up the Privileges of the People and divesting the Parliament of the Power of limiting the Succession to the Crown  It may be remember'd that in the late Treaty of Union with  Scotland  some Secret Overtures were made to have engaged the  Dutch  to be Guarantees of that Treaty and though that Proposal seem'd to come from such Hands as gave Reason to believe it was rather a Design to destroy than secure the said Treaty the  Dutch  having at that Time discover'd Willingness enough to have prevented the Conclusion of that Treaty yet those that knew any Thing of the Resentment expressed at that Time here against that Proposal as dishonourable to  England  and destructive of the Constitution of both Kingdoms would wonder that ever the same Ministry should so far change their Notions as to admit the same Guarantee in so Nice an Affair as the Succession to their own Crown which  they rejected with Contempt in a Treaty with the Neighbouring Nation  Secondly Another End answered by this Treaty of Guarantee was giving an Opportunity to the  Dutch  to play their own Game with us with Respect to other Treaties Quota's Proportions of Payments Ships Troops and the like of this so much has been said already and is yet like to be said farther in Publick that I shall need say the less to it here my Design being rather to justifie the Resentment all honest Men entertain at the mean Politicks and Submissions of our People here and to show the Necessity of taking wiser for the future than to Animate People against any of our Confederates I am as forward as any to agree that the Advantages of a strict Union among the Confederates are very great and that as Her Majesty exprest it the Interest of the States of  Holland  be looked upon as our own but this by no means hinders us from desiring that the  Dutch  should use us well should shew a Reciprocal Kindness and should act with a mutual Concern for the General Confederated Interest and that we should not be willing to see them impose upon us in any of those Particulars or be easie and submit quietly to it when they do and this is so much Justice that none can object against and what is the best if not the only Way to cultivate and maintain that Friendship and good Understanding  on both Sides which is so much the Interest of the Confederacy in General and of the  Dutch  themselves in Particular They who contend that the enquiring into these Things seems to show a Disregard to the Confederacy in General or to the several Parties concerned in Particular seem to make severer Satyrs upon the  Dutch  than they are aware of The Deficiencies of the Performance they cannot deny the want of a due Regard then to the Confederacy must certainly lye rather in those that have been the Cause of those Deficiencies than those that have not for who are most justly to be charged with slighting and disregarding the mutual Interest of the Consederacy they that have failed in the Performance of the Condititions or they that complain of it in order to have them performed  Britain  has all along shown by a Zeal Fatal to herself her Willingness to push on the War with all imaginable Vigour in order to which when Her deficient Allies having less Concern for the general Good have run the Venture of Miscarriage to shorten their Expence  Britain  as if the whole Charge of the War had been her Due to pay has zealously supply'd both their Quota's and her own While she was willing to do thus her Confederates daily encreas'd their Deficiencies and her Expence as they might very well do finding her so easie and  while she was willing to sit still and see herself thus used it was very remarkable how Augmentations and Increase of Forces was every Year proposed by the Confederates as well in  Flanders  as in  Spain  and none so forward as the Emperor himself to increase the Quota's of the Troops and the Charges of the War upon the rest of his Confederates quietly waiting for their supplying Additional Troops and taking Care to have very few of his own  While we submitted to all these Things the War went quietly on but whether so successfully or no as it might have done if the Allies had answered what we had Reason to expect from them is left for them to Answer At last the  British  Court entering into a more narrow Inspection of Things have not thought fit so calmly to suffer the Weight of the War to lye heavier upon one Shoulder than another and tho' equally willing to bear their Share of the Burthen yet not forward to carry that Load which ought to lye upon other Shoulders They are now calling upon their Confederates to consider a little the Justice of their several Treaties and to look back and see what they are obliged to do if they expect the War should be carried on any farther if they are diffident of the Success of these Remonstrances from their Experience how fruitless the like  have been before and have therefore at the same Time embrac'd the Occasion that has offer'd towards putting an End to the War by an Honourable Peace they will be justified in it before all the World both now and for ever when it shall be at the same Time understood in what Manner and for how many Years this War has been carried on nor can the Artifices of an Adverse Party among us delude many in their suggesting to the World that the Government here is in the Interest of  France  since they can have no other Reason to back that Suggestion than that they were not willing to carry on a War upon unequal Terms and in a Confederacy with Allies who would not perform their own Conditions and in which those who expected the greatest Advantages from it paid the least Part of the Expence towards it  Thirdly the Third End which this general Complaint against a Peace has been Calculated to Answer and which the Party has taken Care to make as popular as they can is a general Notion that those who are for a Peace do it with a Design by the Assistance of  France  to introduce the Pretender however weak and inconsistent such a Consequence may be nothing is more certain than that many innocent and wellmeaning People have been prevailed upon to believe it and tho' the Improbilities of the Thing in its own Nature  and the steady Zeal of the Persons who they charge with it and who have all along in a Course of many Years testified their Abhorrence of that Interest and taken such Steps against it as have been most effectual to the cutting off all Hope both from him and his Party might suffice to any reasonable People yet this seems to be one of those Difficulties which can be solved only by a little Patience and Time To those who will be convinced by Argument it seems sufficient that our putting a stop to a War which we carried on at so much Disadvantage and which had in View rather an utter Empoverishing the Nation than a timely Reducing our Enemies to Reason however was not only necessary on many other Accounts but greatly our Advantage on this Account in especial Manner that thereby we might be left in a Condition to defend our Constitution and to preserve Power to maintain our Succession as our Parliament had thought fit to limit it without the Help of the  Dutch  and without being put to so weak so scandalous and so dishonourable a Shift as to accept of the Guarantee of Foreign States to preseve our own Acts of Parliament  When I look farther into this scandalous Thing called a Guarantee for our Succession methinks it represents to me our People on their Knees to the  Dutch  for the Mighty Favour of taking us into their High  and Mighty Protection and indeed when this is compared with the Manner with which the States of  Holland  carried on the  Geentruydenbergh  Treay wherein the making a Peace for us was also left wholly to or engrossed by the States of  Holland  the Thing seems very much of a Peice The Barrier Treaty also has much of the same Manner in it which being handled at large by itself I say no more to here I have observed that at the Time when we began to talk here of Peace and when the  French  Articles began to appear we were mightily amused with the  Dutch  making Offers that they would take away the Excuse from us of want of Money or Credit and the  Dutch  would advance to us Four Millions Sterling to encourage us to carry on the War That the  Dutch  made such an Offer Publickly in Form is known to be a Mistake but that the  Dutch  might be willing to lend or to give as much as that amounts to to have the Sole Direction of making the Peace that so their particular Interest which they never forget might be principally provided for this there can be no great Question of and the  Dutch  are not without Cunning enough to make it so well worth their while as that such a Sum of Money should not be ill laid out But those People should do well to consider Two or Three Things which lye hid in this Notion of the  Dutch  lending us so  much Money and which by Way of Corollary may be of great Use to us in the understanding of other Parts of Management on that Side That if the States of  Holland  for the carrying on the War could spare us so much Money to encourage us that we might not make a Peace without them tho' that has not yet been thought of them however all they thought fit to say in former Times of their being impoverished and exhausted and not in a Condition to pay their Quota's must be a manifest Fraud and Cheat and must be with Design to put upon us the Necessity of carrying it on upon unequal Conditions and this they could not have entertained a Thought of without first being sensible that they had us at so much Advantage as that they knew whenever they thought fit to ease their own Charge they mightput the Hardship upon us Since it was obtained by the Arts of their other Conduct that the  Dutch  had the Sole Direction of the Peace it followed then that we were under an Obligation to carry on the War at their bidding from whence it was most natural to believe they were not darksighted enough not to make their other Advantages These Things make it no longer a Mystery why the  Dutch  would advance any Sum of Money for the encouraging us to carry on the War because it followed that we should carry it on  under the same Inequalities and Disadvantages which we did before but now these Things are detected and if we should come to a Necessity of carrying on the War which God forbid yet that it should be more than probable we may not only demand that they begin upon a new Foot and make up all their Quota's for the Time to come but also may call upon them for what is past also it is more than probable that they may then plead Poverty with us as they did before and talk no more of the great Sums they would lend us There is yet another Remark to be made upon this Head  viz  of the  Dutch  advancing such great Sums of Money to us we have never found but these Sums were to be all lent upon good Parliamentary Security and on the Interest current in  England  and we might not be thought ungrateful to the Lenders if we asked them where was the Advantage of all that Was it to us or to themselves They must not know the  Dutch  so well as we have Reason to know them who expect to find them ever forgetful of their own Interest in any Proposal they may make It is true we have complained of our being impoverislsed and exhausted and not in a Condition to carry on the War especially at the rate which it hath been carried on at without great Inconveniencies and Involving Mortgaging and Anticipating for us and our Posterity at a Rate which  neither are like to see the End of but what is our Defect We do not want Lenders but Funds to borrow upon we have Usurers enough among us to devour us we want no Help from the  Dutch  we are not without a Sort of Men among us who having little or no Interest in the Freehold have amassed infinite Sums of Money in Cash with which they Trade upon the rest and live upon the Blood and Vitals of the Government these like the Eagles where the Carkass falls gather together and if the Parliament can but find Funds tho' they boast of having the Power of Credit in themselves and often think of making themselves Formidable by threatning the Government that they will lend no Money and that they can ruin the Publick Credit by refusing to advance their Money yet they can no more forbear than a Vulture can forbear his Prey the Funds are the Carkass they feed on they are as Hungry for them as a Lion that has been Hunting and found no Food and in spight of their Faith often Pledg'd to their Party and Friends to run down Credit and lend no Money let but the Ministry find a Fund and the Parliament establish a Lottery or Subscription or Loan and they are ready to trample one another to Death to get in their Money So that after all that hath been said of the  Dutch  lending us Money we see nothing to be said to it but what  was said in Answer to some Bantering Lines in the Time of King  Charles  II made upon the King which his Majesty by Repartee answered himself thus  "  Charles  at this Time having no Need  " Thanks you as much as if he did  It is apparent in our Case we want no Lenders we have been devoured with Harpies already who think as no doubt the  Dutch  would also think and perhaps say too that  the Borrower is Servant to the Lender  But we must acknowledge we want  Funds  to borrow and where to find them such excepted as will plunge us yet farther and farther into a Gulph whence no less than a Hundred Years can redeem us is past the Skill of the best Advocates for a War to find out indeed I cannot but wonder that in all the Noise the Faction have made at these Things they have not descended to one Argument against the Difficulty of raising Funds they have indeed told us Great Things  a la Gasconade  that there are Funds enough that  England  is vastly rich that there is Money enough that we can with Ease carry on the War this Seven Years and such Rhodomontade that they have Surfeited the People with it for some Time but we do not see one of them that offers any Scheme how and upon what destructive ruinous Fund this  Money may be raised that the People may judge whether what is alledged be true yea or no and whether those Funds they shall so propose shall not be as fatal to the general Good as those that have gone before with such fallacious Ways have the People been managed till they have led them on to the brink of inevitable Ruin and now as if it were not enough that the Nation hath for so many Years been oppressed by the War through the Negligence or Knavery of our Consederates we are modestly desired to proceed in the War upon the same Foot I confess this among our own People is a Sign of some National Stupidity and Blindness which one would hardly think possible but for our Neighbours whether the States General or others to desire in seems to smell of something we want a Word for in our Tongue and may be better express'd in  French  by  Marveillieux Surprenant  and the like I must needs say I have not yet met with any Man so weak but what begins to feel the Force of this Argument enter into his Soul if the Allies have not perform'd according to their Agreement they should be reminded of it and if we cannot prevail with them to make up former Defects we ought at least to be careful that they comply punctually for the Time to come Can any People be so besotted to a Party as to expect or desire that a Nation already  impoverished by the unfair Impositions of Her Allies and not able to carry on the War on the Terms she hath done for some Time should not insist upon more Justice for the future that she may be able to hold it out  Neither is this an unnecessary Argument at this Time for if we can carry on this War at the Expence of Three Millions and Half Yearly instead of Seven then we are better able to go on Two Years upon the Square with our Allies than One Year upon the unequal Foundation we have gone upon all along so that to bring our Allies to do us Justice and to exert themselves to the uttermost in carrying on the War is the truest and best Step towards the main Point  viz  of carrying it on if we are assured we shall no more be imposed upon if we see the full Quota's of Troops in the Field the full Numbers of Ships in the  Mediterranean  and all Things in Readiness in Time and fit for Action if any Thing will revive the drooping Spirits of the Nation it must be this it must be that they have some Hopes of not being cheated again and that the powerful Assistance of the Allies will be a Means of putting a happy and speedy End to the War that a safe Peace may follow and it is easie to find that nothing but this wil  do it nothing else can perswade an exhausted Nation to bleed anew but some Assurance that they shall not be suffered by  their Allies to bleed to Death that there shall be some End of their Sorrows and Miseries and that every Hand is fairly engaged in bringing Things to a happy End  But these Things seem to call for no further Remark from us they are so natural and plain in themselves that every Child in these Affairs may understand them for if we must carry on the War it must be needful that we suffer ourselves to be no more abused by our Allies if we are not to expect Justice from our Allies then we must be unaccountably besotted if we carry on the War nay tho' a worse Peace were to follow than Her Majesty hath good Reason to expect from the Negotiations now on Foot  But it may not be amiss to enquire here what Prospect there appears of these Things and what Hopes our Allies do put us in of expecting for the future better Treatment and that in the Pursuit of the War they will go on upon a different Foot from that which they have hitherto gone upon for if there was but some Appearance of an Amendment for the future it might be some Encouragement to us to think of prosecuting the ensuing Campaigns with more Comfort but instead of this all we yet see amounts to little that Way for at Home all the Fruit of the Discovery shows only a kind of Regret that it is made publick an inward fretting that the Fact is too obvious so that  they cannot contradict it and an envious Warmth at the Justice done their own Countrey in it because it touches upon the StatesGeneral as if to touch them were fatal to us all and perhaps it may indeed be fatal to some Projects the Party had ser on Foot here destructive enough to the Liberty of their Country and of which a little Time may give us a farther View This is clear in that all the Reply we have here to the detecting the hard Usage we have met with from our Allies issues in Exclamations at our exposing the  Dutch  and falling upon the  Dutch  spreading Reports that we design to fall out with the  Dutch  and that we are for a Peace with  France  and a VVar with the  Dutch  as if we must refrain a due Inspection into our own Affairs for fear of the Effects it will or may have upon the  Hollanders  it is no less the Duty of every Faithful Representative to enquire how other Nations may impose upon the People and waste and destroy us than it is how we are embezzelled at Home for every Breach of Treaty is in this kind a Depredation upon the People and it is most reasonable that when they have thus discovered the Fraud and by who as well as by what Means the Nation is exhausted and worn out they should so far expose the Matters of Fact and the Persons that the People may know by what Means they are impoverished this hath been the constant Method and  Usage of Parliaments and the Members of Parliament could not have discharged the Trust they have committed to them by the People they Represent it they had omitted it Nor can this be called exposing the  Dutch  they lay open the Truth if that exposes the  Dutch  or any other Persons or States the Misfortune is their own to be liable to such a Charge but let such People answer what they would have had the House of Commons have done when upon Enquiry into the State of the War they found that we had not been fairly used by the Confederates if they had held their Peace had they not been Criminally Silent Had they not betrayed their Countrey Had they not been Accessary to all the Frauds of the like Kind which should have happen'd for the Future And what would the Language of Posterity have been when they should have seen that the House of Commons knew these Things but took no Notice of them or any Care to have the Nation informed of them Must it not have been a just Reproach upon them as it is now upon those who knew it before and yet took no Notice of it or made any Application to former Parliaments to have it redressed But it is evident these People who make now such loud Complaints of the Reflections cast upon our Allies appear more concerned that the Matter is made Publick than that it is true and are so far from desiring any Cure  for the Disease that they spend all their Heat and Resentment at the Discoveries of it and it is to be observed from their Conduct that they make Ten Reflections upon the House of Commons and the Present Ministry for the Industry and Pains taken in finding out how and by whom the Nation has been abused for One just Remark upon the Integrity and Zeal in the War of those Allies who have used us in such a Manner Whence such a Spirit can proceed and what Reason can be given for it is not so hard to find out as it is melancholy to reflect that so it should be  I might go forward in this Observation to expose the Foundation from whence all this proceeds and by which we should soon see for what Uses and Purposes some People are so desirous of pushing on the War and how to do it they care not upon what Disadvantages and unequal Conditions they did it being willing to bear any part of the Burthen nay all the Burthen so the beloved War were but to be pursued the Enquiry into this will open many Scenes of private Treachery not yet brought to Light and for that I purpose to do it in a Tract by itself I shall leave it to a fit Occasion  It falls next in View to Interrogate the Ministers at  Ʋtrecht  how they proceed and see thereby what Measures the  Dutch  take to convince us that we shall have a better  and more equal Ballance kept up among us in case the War is to be continued But here you shall find Measures calculated rather to compel the Queen of  GreatBritain  to carry on the War than to invite Her Majesty to it by Assurances of performing Treaties better than in the Times past This is a Temper so different from what might be expected from a People who had so treated their Allies to us who complain of being so treated that it is as before  Marvellieux  or to put it plainer a kind of throwing off the Mask as if we were obliged to submit to be cheated after we had first discovered that it was so and that what before was done covertly and under the Appearance of a Treaty was now to be done more effectually openly avowedly and in the Teeth of the rest of the Allies  This appeared upon the first Conference after the  French  Plenipotentiaries had delivered in their Paper of Explanation as they called it on the Proposals of the Peace which they had formerly given in It came then to the Turn of the Allies to consider in what manner to deliver in their Answer to the  French  Proposals this it was resolved should be by the Confederate Ministers delivering in their Demands or the several Pretensions of their respective Principles without taking any Notice of the Project contain'd in the Paper given in by the Ministers  of  France  it should have been noted here in the first Place that after all the  Dutch  had said and after all that had been said to them in order to come to this Treaty prepared to preserve a good Understanding among the Allies and to bring the Treaty to the desired Conclusion  viz  a good Peace The  Dutch  Ministers appeared there without any Character having neither Powers as Plenipotentiaries or as Ambassadors or any Thing more than meer Commissioners Empowered only to hear what was said make Report to their Masters the States and give back their Answers which one of the Queen's common Messengers may as well do on our Side Nor were the Persons the Equipages or the Sallaries allowed to their said Commissioners any more than what was suitable to common Messengers whose Business it was to carry a Message and return with an Answer so that in the Conferences either General or Particular there was no debating Things with them only just giving in what any one had to say and all the Answer these Men could give was that they would Report it to their HighMightinesses the States General and would bring their Answer The  French  Plenipotentiaries presently objected against these Powers as not sufficient to admit the  Dutch  Ministers into the Conferences The  British  Plenipotentiaries tho' they were sensible of the  Affront offered in it to their Royal Mistress after such Assurances on Her Majesties Part of Her sincere Intention to make the Interest of all Her Allies to be as Her own yet willing to wave every Thing that might give an Obstruction to the happy Issue of the Peace did not insist on this though they could not but complain that it greatly obstructed that happy Concert of Measures which they hoped might have been the constant Fruit of the private Conferences of the Confederate Ministers which the  Dutch  having no Powers that extended any farther than barely to Hear and Report and bring back a Resolution was for want of those Powers quite disappointed so that the  Dutch  Ministers might as justly be deemed and termed Porters as Plenipotentiaries Well notwithstanding all this the  British  Plenipotentiaries willing to promote the great End for which they assembled which as the Lord Bishop of  Bristol  exprest it was in the Name of God to bring the Wars to a happy Conclusion in an Equitable and Honourable Peace all these Obstructions were past over on their Side and they labour'd to have the Powers of the  Dutch  Ministers accepted as at last they were with some Difficulty and thus they proceed to the Affair of the Demands as above which were to be delivered in as the th of  March  The  Dutch  Ministers concealing the Resolution taken at the  Hague  to give in no Demands  but the very immediate Copy of the Preliminaries last treated on insisted that all the Confederates Demands should be formed into one Instrument and be given in jointly by all the Plenipotentiaries as the general Demands of the whole Alliance This tho' something surprizing in itself yet was the less so when it was more known that this was in order to execute the Measures above noted  viz  of bringing in the Preliminaries of  Geertruydenbergh  as the Summary Demands of the Allies But the  British  Plenipotentiaries taking Notice of it insisted that this seem'd to be destructive of the Treaty itself that  France  had Twice ventured to carry on the War rather than agree to those Preliminaries That they had been declared Impracticable and could not be treated on here and to insist on the very literal Form of those Preliminiaries now and prescribe the Plenipotentiaries to treat on them was to declare against a Treaty at all That this Meeting was understood by all Parties to be not a Treaty of Preliminaries in order to a Treaty of Peace but a General Treaty of Peace itself wherein the Specifick Demands of every Ally were to be heard debated and finally discussed adjusted and answered to their Satisfaction which could by no Means be done by Preliminary Articles which had in them several References to a farther Treaty and some suggested Demands left to be farther discussed  at another Time whereas they were now met to make a final and general Conclusion of all Demands and Pretensions whatsoever that there might be no more Blood shed in the Christian World that an End might be put to the Miseries of  Europe  it was also alledged that the said Preliminaries had not been concerted with a due Regard to the Interest of all the Allies in especial Manner it was asked what Article there was to be found in them which regarded the Interest of Her  Britannick  Majejesty farther than what meerly respected Her Title to the Crown and the Banishment of the Pretender whereas there seemed a great deal of Reason for admitting farther Demands for the Security and enlarging the Commerce and Possessions of Her Majesty and Her Subjects for this Reason as well as in Behalf of the rest of the Confederates the said  British  Plenipotentiaries insisted upon giving in the Instrument of their Demands in particular every Ally by themselves  It must be something astonishing to such true Lovers of their Countrey who can look back on these Things with unprejudiced Judgements to reflect on the Temper reigning in this Part of  Europe  at the Time of the Treaty aforesaid when in all the numerous Articles adjusted at the  Hague  and afterwards debated again at  Geertruydenberg  by  the  Dutch  and  French  the former left out nothing which concerned their own Interest Security or Advantage nay engaged the  British  Court to concern and engage themselves for their particular Security and Advantages but not one Word Clause Article or Debate was ever thought of for the  English  either as to the Security of their Commerce as it then stood or the Encrease of it for the future On the other Hand all the Stress on the  British  Side and for which we were to think ourselves infinitely obliged to the  Dutch  was to engage their Assistance to keep out the Pretender and secure the Succession of the Crown of  GreatBritain  to his Electoral Highness of  Hannover  a Thing which is so the Universal Resolution of all the People and Parties in  Britain  and to which they think all the Opposition that can be made from either  French  or any else is so trifling and insignificant that they cannot be sensible of the exceeding Obligation on that Behalf to their Confederates or of the great Danger which they were in of the Pretender although no Foreign Assistance had been engaged on that Behalf esteeming the Favourers of the Pretender in  Britain  not withstanding their great Clamours of a Party among us to be so sew and so inconsiderable as that there is nothing to be seared from them but supposing there had been more Danger of this  Clause  viz  the Succession then we are willing to hope there is Ground to apprehend it cannot but be reminded that it is as much the Interest of the StatesGeneral to secure that Succession in the Illustrious House of  Hannover  as it is even of  GreatBritain  itself and much more than it can be supposed to be to  Britain  to secure to them the Barrier of  Flanders  for should the Dominions of her  Britannick  Majesty ever fall into the Hands of a  Popish  or  French  Interest or into the Hands of a Prince who is or may be in the Interest of  France  the Territories of the StatesGeneral being stript of the Powerful Assistance of the  British  Troops by Land and Fleets by Sea must inevitably be exposed to the Powerful Invasion of  French  and  British  Fleets united and their Trade in particular eaten up and destroyed as was verified by woful Experience to the said States in the Year when if the  English  Court had not broken off from the said  French  Alliance the StatesGeneral had inevitably sunk under the Power of  France  and their Government been dissolved and destroyed so that upon the whole it is manifest there was no need on our Part to engage the  Dutch  to appear for the Security of our Succession to the House of  Hannover  for that the Sovereign Law of their own Preservation will always put them under a Necessity of doing it the contrary being most sure to be a great Step in their Injury  if not their evident Destruction It may be argued that in Rules of Government we are not to depend upon this or that State being obliged by their own Interest to assist us but we are to regard what Necessity either for Security of Trade common Safety of Government or other Political Inteterest we are in or may be in of the Assistance of the Powers we are treating with and if that Necessity appears it is a sufficient Reason for us to secure that Assistance and this we have frequent Examples of as of the  Dutch  themselves treating with us in when notwithstanding it was the undoubted Interest of  England  not to let  Holland  upon any Terms whatever fall into the Hands of  France  and if ever the  French  do again make that Attempt we ought to assist the  Dutch  with all our Troops and Power and that not so much from any Care and Kindness to them as a Nation but for our own Interest and Preservation yet the  Dutch  knowing the Eyes of a Nation are not always open to their own Interest thought fit to tie us to assist them in that Case and even Articled with us for the Proportion  viz  the Number of Ten Thousand Men This is brought for a Reason why not withstanding its being so much the Interest of the States of  Holland  to preserve the Succession of the House of  Hannover  to the Crown of  GreatBritain  we ought also to bind them to it by Treaty But tho' we  were to grant all this it will not follow that this Treaty should have such a Price put upon it that the  Dutch  should demand of us all they want for this little Equivalent and the Reasons above tho' they should not be allowed to subsist against the Treaty of Guarantee itself will certainly take off much of that High Price which the  Dutch  have put upon it as if we were under such Infinite Obligations to them to secure it for us as that we were quite out of Condition to defend it ourselves or as if they had no Concern or were to receive no Security Benefit or Advantage at all by it to themselves Again it might pass for some Argument in this Case that if any Power in  Europe  ought to have sought this Guarantee from the StatesGeneral it should have been the Elector himself who on his Part might probably have some more Occasion to secure his Passage over to  England  and the March of any Troops which his Highness might find necessary to bring with him to assist his Faithful People of  Britain  to place him on the Throne in Case a  French  or  Popish  Interest should make Opposition Here indeed the StatesGeneral might be very useful Allies and his Electoral Highness would have thought very well of such a Guarantee of the States but it cannot be conceived that  Britain  can be under like Necessity of such a Security The Succession which is their own Act and Deed being universally  approved by the whole Nation a few People excepted who are contemptible either for their Number or Interest so that on all these Accounts it seems however a Treaty of Guarantee may be useful enough for our Succession and no Harm in it yet it cannot be a Thing of that Weight as to have so great a Value set upon it and that  Britain  should suffer herself so much to be impos'd upon for it as it is apparent to all the World she has been on that Account  We return now to the Manner of the carrying on of the Treaty of Peace at  Ʋtrecht  The  British  Plenipotentiaries having as I said above insisted upon the giving in the Demands of the Allies in a separate Manner have by this Means an Occasion of securing for the Subjects of Her Majesty some other Advantages than by the former Treaty was thought of and the People of  Britain  may now see not only on what Disadvantage for us the former Treaty was negotiated when we were to have our Markets made for us by our  Dutch  Neighbours but they may see that all the Noise that hath been made of the Present Ministry and of the present Managers being in the Interest of  France  amounts only to this That whereas the other gave up all our Interest to the  Dutch  and the Emperor these Men are careful that  Britain  may reap some Advantages by the Treaty as well as the rest of the Confederates  Indeed it has been something wonderful in the common Discourse of the People on these Subjects to find the Generality poisoned by these selfdenying Notions  viz  that all which can be obtained from  France  must be given to the Emperor and the  Dutch  and the King of  Portugal  but nothing to the Queen of  GreatBritain  as if our Strength were no Acquisition or our Power any Safety to the Alliance nay rather as if it were dangerous to the Confederacy to entrust any Part of that we have fought so long for and bought so dear to the Queen of  GreatBritain  One would think the  Dutch  themselves went on that Notion when as was apparent they appeared uneasie and jealous at the Preparations made by Her Majesty to send a Fleet and Forces to  Canada  while not knowing the Design they apprehended it to be for the taking Possession of some Place or other in the  Spanish America  altho' by the  th Article of the Grand Alliance it was agreed that Her Majesty might lawfully have done so if she had thought fit These Things however of no other Consequence yet serve to let us see how different as respecting us the Manner of the Allies hath been in all the Transactions of this War and how different their Views have been in all their Steps towards a Peace from our constant Behaviour in the same Heads as they respected them and that in all these Occasions it has been the constant Maxim of our Confederates  that we were to have no Share in any Thing but that the  Dutch  under a Notion of a Barrier and Security to their Frontiers should make large Acquisitions both to their Territory and their Commerce both which have been consented to from hence whether it be to the Honour or to the Infamy of those who have given in to these Measures is left to the Impartial Part of Mankind to determine It is evident that at length the Just Representations of the  British  Ministers took Place and the  Dutch  after much Difficulty have yeilded that the Demands of the Allies be given in to the  French  altho' in one and the same Instrument yet in separate Heads and the  British  Plenipotentiaries agree and propose to add at the End of every Head this General  and Satisfaction of all the rest of the Allies  a Clause sufficient to remove the Scandal and Reproach early cast upon the Present Management  viz  That they designed to make a Separate Peace and had actually concluded the Conditions there of with  France  before the Congress was to begin I must crave Pardon if I make these several Instances of the Usage of Her Majesty hath met with from Her Allies Rank in with their other Conduct relating to Forces and Quota's which have already been made Publick and all together to come under the Title of Deficiencies for if there had been a more disinterested Conjunction of Counsel and Assistance of Measures  in the Proceedings of the Allies to and with Her  Britannick  Majesty and Her Ministers no Question this Treaty had been with more Ease brought on with more Mutual Assistance to and Confidence in one another entred into and perhaps the Success might have been more promising also  There seems to be no Occasion here of Entring into the Clauses which the  Dutch  have obtain'd in any of their Treaties and Agreements with us by which they have gain'd Advantages in Commerce particularly to our Prejudice because even the  Dutch  themselves acknowledge them in their late Letter to Her Majesty only declaring That they do not design to take the Advantage of those Articles I am very willing to believe the StatesGeneral especially while a good Understanding among the Allies and particularly between Them and Us is so necessary to them would not make Use of the Advantages which were given them by that Treaty but this does by no Means deny nay it not Tacitly only but even Explicitly as it seems to Indifferent Judgments grants that such Advantages are given to the  Dutch  by that Treaty See the Declaration of the  Dutch  on this Head more particularly as follows  'For having learnt that the Principal Exceptions taken to the said Treaty were that it might prove Prejudicial to the  Commerce of Her Majesty's Subjects in the  Spanish Netherlands  and that some had entertain'd an illgrounded and erroneous Opinion that the States might design to take Advantage by it to make themselves Masters of the said  Spanish Netherlands  their High Mightinesses did declare postively and by this Letter do voluntarily repeat it that it never was their Intention nor ever will be to make use of the said Treaty or of their Garrisons in the Fortified Places of the Country to prejudice in any Manner the Commerce of Her Majesty's Subjects but that their Opinion is That whatever relates to Navigation and Commerce there ought to be settled on an intire Equality that so Her Majesty's Subjects may not be charged with higher Duties of Importation or Exportation than theirs to the end Commerce may be carried on there by both Nations on an equal Foot'  Here the StatesGeneral acknowledge That whatever relates to Navigation and Commerce in the  Spanish Netherlands  ought to be settled on an entire Equality This is owning what Her Majesty has since claimed to be Just and yet that it has not been so is apparent also and in the same Letter they acknowledge it again by adding  'That if there be some Articles of the said Treaty which without affecting the Essentials of it may be thought to  want Explanation Her Majesty shall find them willing and ready to treat thereupon with all the Facility and Condescension that can reasonable be required of them'  Now however Satisfactory such an Offer is from the  Dutch  who indeed cannot be suppos'd to be Ignorant of the Justice of Her Majesty's Demands in this Case as not to come to a farther Explanation on these Heads yet all this adds to and confirms the Complaint against the Conduct at least of those employ'd from hence who in behalf of their own Country could pass such a Treaty and sign such a Convention by which it appears were not the  Dutch  willing to explain themselves upon it there was Effectually given up to them both the Sovereignty and the Commerce of the  Spanish Netherlands  the last being Exclusive of the  English  There is no doubt to me that this was evident at that Time and therefore it is that I cannot place it to the Account of Ignorance or Inadvertency for the Duke of  Marlborough  saw into it and therefore how willing soever in other Cases to oblige the  Dutch  he had not so little Concern for his own Safety as not to know a  British  Parliament would certainly one Time or other call a Treaty so Dishonourable and Prejudicial to  Britain  in question and therefore no doubt whatever other Reasons his Grace might have also he thought fit not  to be drawn in to set his Hand to it but refus'd to be a Party to it tho' at that Time a Plenipotentiary from hence but another Hand and other Management effected it and now the  Dutch  are willing to explain these Things to our Satisfaction which would admit of many Remarks as to the former Part of it which I omit because Satisfaction will be now obtain  d Only this cannot in Justice to the Present Ministry and Parliament be omitted  viz  That if this Enquiry into these Things had not been begun those Explanations had never been obtain'd and the  Dutch  had been left in a Capacity when they thought fit to exclude the Subjects of  Britain  from all Trade and Commerce in the  Spanish Netherlands  and had been enabled whenever their Occasions made it for their Purpose to have seiz'd upon the  Spanish Netherlands  and have made themselves entire Masters thereof so that the preventing these Things seems wholly owing to the Vigilance of the Present Ministry and to the vigorous Resolutions of the Present Parliament  There seems indeed one Clause in the said Letter which some People are very forward here to take hold of insinuating That the  Dutch  complain of being trick'd in  England  into a Consent to a Negotiation of Peace by being put in Hopes that after they should do so the other Affair of the Barrier should be adjusted to their Satisfaction  the Words are these  'That however having not long since been inform'd that in  England  some were of Opinion that the said Treaty in some Articles might be prejudicial to Her Majesty's Subjects the Commissioned M  Buys  their Envoy Extraordinary then going to  England  to inquire what those Points were that might be thought Grievances and authorized to treat about them with Her Majesty's Ministers and to remove it possible the Difficulties by all the Explanations that should appear necessary  which they were put in Hopes would not be very hard to do when once they should have consented to concur with Her Majesty as they did to procure a Congress for the Negotiation of a General Peace  But that the Misfortune was that the said M  Buys  during his Residence in  England  was not able to finish that Affair to reciprocal Satisfaction and that it having been remitted to the  Hague  no Way has hitherto been found to terminate it there neither tho' their High Mightinesses think they have shewn all the Readiness to comply with any Just Expedient that could reasonably be expected from them'  This seems to be very ill turn'd by a Party among ourselves and implies as they pretend as if the  British  Court had made Light of the Matter and promised to adjust it if the  Dutch  would do  so  and  so  but  that after the  Dutch  had complied and  concurr'd with Her Majesty to procure a Congress for the Negotiation of a General Peace  they could never obtain the promised Condition altho they had shewn  'all the Readiness to comply with any just Expedient that could reasonably be expected from them'  This is a Black Charge and had not the  Dutch  with much more Integrity than these People anticipated this Calumny and given the true Reason for their said Concurring with Her Majesty to be their Disposition and Persuasion of the Absolute Necessity there was in the present Conjuncture for the Cultivating and  Maintaining a good Friendship Perfect Confidence and Ʋnion between their said States and Her Majesty  which for the better Authority I give you also from their own Letter  'That during the whole Course of Her Majesty's Glorious Reign they have had nothing more at Heart than to cultivate and maintain with Her a Good Friendship Perfect Confidence and Union and to corroborate them the most they possibly could having always judged them absolutely Necessary and especially in the present Conjuncture That they likewise judged they could not give a better Proof of this their Disposition and Persuasion than that which they lately gave in agreeing to the Proposition which Her Majesty had caused to be made to them to begin the Negotiation  of a General Peace with the Enemy and in concurring with Her Majesty to facilitate the bringing together of the Ministers of all the High Allies to the Congress at  Ʋtrecht  '  This effectually Contradicts what as before is suggested  viz  That they were induced  '  to concur with Her Majesty as they did to procure a Congress for the Negotiation of a General Peace  '  Upon their being put in Hopes that it would not be very hard to do after they had consented so to concur with Her Majesty I say this is so contradicted by what is said before that I was tempted to doubt both the said Paragraphs could not be in one and the same Letter and indeed it seems shocking to any Reader that their High Mightinesses should say in one Part of their Letter that they concurr'd with Her Majesty  to give the best Proof of their Disposition to cultivate a good Friendship Perfect Confidence and Ʋnion with Her Majesty  and in another Part of the same Letter to say that they concurr'd  '  with Her Majesty as they did to procure a Congress for the Negotiation of a General Peace  '  These Considerations being too hard for my Understanding are left to the Logical Discussion of the Party here whole Talent so eminently lyes in Equivocation and Insignificant  Railery who when they have chewed it and mumbled it like an Ass upon Thistles will bring it out the same thorny crabbed Inconsistency that they found it  But while we are leaving them to this difficult Work it may be needful to look farther for we have yet much more Work cut out from  Holland  than in the foregoing Piece the StatesGeneral having receiv'd a new Brush from the  British  Parliament are very solicitous to wash their Negro Skin as clean as they can from the Imputations which have lain so plainly against them but now they find it more difficult than they did before for till now they had only Pamphlets and general Clamours to answer such as the Suspicions of the People and the Information of a Few had made loud and which began to make them uneasy these were treated with some Contempt by the States and more by their Friends here  But the Parliament finding more Truth in these Things than perhaps they expected and much more than the Faction pretended thought it requir'd an Extraordinary Sanction to make them less disputed and thought it Just to make them Publick with an undisputed authority that the People ought to be undeceiv'd and that the Quarrels about the Truth of Fact ought to cease among the People for this Reason having caused  all the Particulars to be exactly and faithfully laid before them by the Report of the Commissioners of the Admiralty and other proper Officers and those Particulars to be critically examin'd they deduced from thence the Matters of Fact as they really were and making all the Cases plain in which the Government had been impos'd upon by their Allies and the  Dutch  Deficient among others they came to several Resolves about the same and drawing those Resolves up into General Heads referring to the Particulars for their Demonstration they Humbly represented all in an Address to Her Majesty and caused both the said Resolves and the Address to be Printed for the Conviction of all Her Majesty's good Subjects and to confute and silence a Party who as abovesaid had made it their Business to ridicule all that had been said of these Matters as false and empty Notions infused into Peoples Heads to raise ill Blood and create Prejudices against the  Dutch  If these Things coming forth with such an undisputed Authority did a little surprize the World and consequently open the Eyes of the People much more would they surprise the StatesGeneral whose Interest it had so long been to have the People of  Britain  kept as ignorant as possible of these Matters and finding it absolutely Necessary that something should be said to puzzle the Cause a little and to furnish  their Friends with Arguments for their Defence they issue a Paper Entituled as follows  A Memorial serving to prove that the StatesGeneral of the Ʋnited  Netherlands  are unjustly charged by the Resolutions or Votes of the House of Commons of the Parliament of  GreatBritain  and by the Subsequent Address of the said House of Commons thereupon presented to Her Majesty the Queen of  GreatBritain  with having been deficient in divers Respects during the present War in furnishing what according to their Quota or Contingent they stood engaged for towards carrying on the said War  This is the Paper which I come now to examine and in which if I should discover that the StatesGeneral have really been so far from clearing themselves of the Charge so positively laid upon them in Parliament that in every Part they either directly or tacitly acknowledge it then there will remain little Force in the rest of their Paper  In considering this New and Great Affair of the  Dutch Memorial  it seems very proper to make as few Circumlocutions as possible and come directly to the Point Our Introduction therefore shall consist rather of laying down a List of the Particulars which we shall leave out than of what we shall put into the following Tract what  shall be dropp'd as foreign to the Case in Hand and not worth either the Author's while to Note or the Readers to be concern'd about As First It shall take up little of our Time to animadvert on the Insolence Unparallell'd of a Scandalous Mercenary who in Defiance of a  British  Parliament and while that Parliament was actually sitting should have the Face to publish the Answer or Defence of a Foreign Nation against his own Country  If a Man have receiv'd an Affront from another and meets one of his Servants and says to him you  Jack  or you  Thomas  pray tell your Master I say he is a Villain and a Rascal will not the Servant if he have any Manners or Sense of his Duty say to him  Sir  let him be what he will he is my Master and it is not fit for me to tell him so pray employ Somebody else On the other Hand if the Ignorant Fellow should have so little Wit or Manners as to carry this Message to his Master would not the Master say to him let the Man be what he will you are an Unmannerly Rascal for bringing me such a Message since you were my Servant and not his And would he not very justly cane him and turn him out of his Service for his Impudence  This Case as it is unprecedented unless in the same Person who did the like once before so it will be doubly unprecedented in the Publick Justice if he is uncorrected  for it Nay by how much more the Party glory in and boast of having insulted the Parliament and the Government in this Publication by so much the more Necessity they bring upon the said Parliament to vindicate themselves and punish the Persons with their utmost Rigour But this is Humbly left and submitted to the Parliament who no doubt will do themselves and their Defender Justice in this Case  Next it shall take up no Part of this Discourse to enquire whether the  Dutch  have ordered these Sheets to be thus published in  England  or no We are not ignorant how many Ways of Late the Foreign Powers concern'd in this War have privately endeavour'd to make themselves and their Actings with Her Majesty Popular here appealing at it were from Her Majesty to her Subjects but we shall not suppose however that they are yet arrived to such a Contempt of their Alliances with Her  Britannick  Majesty as to appear in an Action which derogates so much from the usual Civilities due from one Ally to another as that they should openly and avowedly make an Attempt of this Nature  This Leads us to consider how prudently the Parliament of  Britain  has acted in this Case in which perhaps the  Dutch  as subtle a Nation as they are and how good soever their Politicks have been in other Cases will be put to it how to behave  themselves between the Two Extreams of Owning or Disowning this Publication of their  Memorial  The Parliament have first stigmatiz'd the Paper itself as a  False and Scandalous Libel  but in this Censure they do not call it the  Memorial of the StatesGeneral  but a  Pretended Memorial  Now as the Lie is here given by the whole  British  Nation and that most justly also it remains for the  Dutch  to show us how they please to take it if they own the Paper and the Publication of it here they take the Lie aforesaid to themselves and are obliged to fall under the Charge hush it up and thereby own in Just or resent it which we suppose they will consider of before they go about it On the other Side if they take upon them to mention answer or vindicate this Paper they own not the Paper only but the mean Step of Causing it to be published in  England  in especial Insult to Her Majesty and to the Parliament of  Britain  then sitting and what evil Consequences may follow such a Thing must lye at their Doors It is true that as the Parliament has not thought fit to take it but as a spurious and pretended Paper we might very well do so also but as we see it published in all Parts of  Europe  as allow'd in those Prints in  Holland  who are said to write  cum Privilegio  and as it is in these Countries stiled  The Answer of the States  c we cannot  but treat it as such or at least as an Answer  for  the States if not  The Answer  of  the States  And that this may be justified by good Evidence the Reader may observe that our Prints after the Resentment of the Parliament of  Britain  had made it too dangerous for our Newsmen to go on with the Printing it gave this Account  April  th  Hague April All our Publick Prints  Published by Authority  have been and continue full of the States Reply to the Resolutions of the Commons of  Britain  in Vindication of their Conduct  This we cannot but think gives sufficient Authority to a Writer whether the StatesGeneral are concern'd in the Publication at  London  or no to suppose them to be the real Authors of the Paper itself and that it is really the  States Reply  as above and as such we shall therefore consider it  The First Thing meet for Observation in it is what we ought not by any Means to pass over  viz  That the StatesGeneral confess the Charge acknowledging the Fact directly  viz  That the Quota's for Sea Service were not supply'd or as the Resolution of the House of Commons express it viz  That the StatesGeneral have been desicient in their Quota's for Sea Service in Proportion  to the Numbers of Ships provided by Her Majesty  c  To this the States in their  Memorial  after a very long Introduction answer Two Things First That the Quota the  British  Court proposed to fit out particularly in the Years and were too many or more than was needful for the Service  viz  More than was needed to make the Confederates Superior to the  French  in the  Mediterranean  and that therefore they the States did not think themselves obliged to furnish so many That whereas we should have Seventyfour Ships the Year and Seventynine the Year they thought the Rate of Twentyfour Ships of their State a Proportion against Sixty of Her Majesty's and that they concerted it so with Admiral  Mitchel  So that it is plain here from this very  Memorial  that the States do no Manner of Way deny the Deficiency itself but evade the Force of the Charge by Disputing the Proportions and explaining what they understood by the Two Fifths to Three Fifths so insisted on by the Parliament and how they ought to be understood by others Again they would patch up the Deficiency aforesaid by bringing in the Number of their Men of War employ'd in the North Seas to make up their Quota and they express this very Subtilly as a Thing which they think ought to be set against the Number of Ships  employ'd by the  British  in the Narrow Seas this may be consider'd immediately in their own Terms but First it is fit to Note that both these Arguments confess the Charge in Fact only offer these Explanations or Extenuations So that the Truth of what the Parliament has publish'd in their Representation and Address stand fast is acknowledg'd and confess'd by the States and needs no farther Defence But it comes next of Course to see what Force this Allegation of the  Dutch  as to their Ships in the North Seas ought to have in this Argument and if it appears that these are not and ought not to be reckon'd in the Proportion above and that they were not reckon'd in the First Proportion stated and agreed with the StatesGeneral then all the Consequences drawn from those Proportions will stand the States in no Stead as to any Defence to be made by them against the Charge In the Examination of this we meet with this Clause in the State of Proportions laid before the House by the Lords of the Admiralty which stands Diametrically Opposite to what the States alledge in their  Memorial  in these Words  viz That by the Treaties between the Queen of  GreatBritain  and the StatesGeneral their Proportion of the Ships of the Line of Battle to act in Conjunction with those of this Kingdom in the  Channel  and in and about the  Mediterranean  ought to be Three to our Five  The First Observation meet to  be made here is that the Treaties between the Queen of  GreatBritain  and the States have expresly settled their Respective Proportions which indeed the  Memorial  seems to evade by alledging that in the Grand Alliance the Respective Parties were to assist with  all their Forces  then Complimenting  Britain  I do not say Flattering with being more Powerful than the States they thence deduce the Reasonableness of the Forces of one being more than the other But the StatesGeneral would think themselves but ill answer'd if this Way of Argument was made use of with them for what is all this to the Equality of Proportions Have not the  Dutch  always as the  Memorial  acknowledges treated every Year with the Queen upon the just Proportions of every Year's Service And has not the Queen sent Admiral  Mitchel  always to settle that Point Now the present Question is not whether Nation is most Powerful or whether we are to send more Troops than the StatesGeneral or more Ships but whether the Proportions being settled Annually by Agreement the StatesGeneral have supply'd the Numbers agreed on by those Treaties and sent as many as they agreed to send or no if they have done this then it is true the First settled Proportions are of no Weight On the other Hand if they have not the General Treaty of Empolying  all their Forces or any other are Equally of no Force  Now it is apparent that the StatesGeneral have not supply'd their Quota of Ships for the Services for which they agreed to supply them and therefore we on our Side justly Complain and the Account as it was laid before the House by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and by Her Majesty Command is very plain in the Case admitting of no Dispute wherefore we have for a further and more effectual Convincing the Advocates for the StatesGeneral in this Case caused it to be annexed at large and is as follows  By the Lords Commissioners for Executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of  GreatBritain    Ireland  c of all Her Majesty's Plantatious  HER Majesty's Pleasure having been signify'd to Us by Mr Secretary  St John  that we should in Pursuance of an Address from the House of Commons prepare an Account of the Quota's of Her Majesty's Ships and those of Her Allies during this present War and what Agreements and Conventions have been made for the said Quota's and how the same have been observd We do in Obedience to Her Majesty Command Humbly Report  That by the Treaties between the Queen of  GreatBritain  and the StatesGeneral their Proportion of the Line of Battel to act in Conjunction with those of this Kingdom in the  Channel  and in and about the  Mediterranean  ought to be Three to our Five  That since the Commencement of this War not only Sir  David Mitchel  but Sir  James Wishart  have been appointed by Her Majesty's Command to go to  Holland  and adjust with the StatesGeneral or their Deputies the Quota's of their Ships of War to act in Conjunction with those of Her Majesty's as aforesaid and what was done in Pursuance of those Treaties was sent to Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State to which we Humbly refer  And as to the Number of Ships in the Line of Battle which the StatesGeneral each Year during the War have join  d to Her Majesty's on the foremention'd Services the same will appear by the following Account which hath been computed with as much Exactness as the Nature of the Things will bear  viz  In the Year Her Majesty had Forty four Ships employ'd in the  Channel  and  Soundings  of the Line of Battel and Thirty in and about the  Mediterranean  making in the whole Seventyfour and they were join'd with no more than Thirtythree of the StatesGeneral whereas they should have been Fortyfour  Seventynine of Her Majesty's Ships were employ'd in the aforesaid Services and but Twentytwo of the StatesGeneral which should have been Fortyseven  There was Seventyfour of the Queen's Ships and Eighteen  Dutch  which should have been Fortyfour  Seventynine of Her Majesty's Ships and Twentyeight  Dutch  which should have been Fortyseven  There were but Fifteen Ships of the  Dutch  acted in Conjunction with Seventyeight of the Queen's Ships whereas they should have been Fortysix  To Seventytwo of Her Majesty's they were no more than Twentyseven of the StatesGeneral instead of Fortythree  The StatesGeneral join'd Twentyfive Ships of the Line to Sixtynine of Her Majesty's instead of Fortytwo  No more than Eleven Ships of the States were join'd to Sixtyseven of the Queen's instead of Fortythree  Her Majesty had Sixtytwo employ'd in the aforesaid Service and the StatesGeneral appointed no more than Thirteen to act in Conjunction with them instead of Thirtyseven  There was no more than Twelve  Dutch  Ships instead of Thirtyfive appointed to act with Fiftynine of the Queen's Ships which as well as those in the Preceeding  Year were employ'd in the  Mediterranean  and not so much as one allotted by the StatesGeneral to act in Concert with those of Her Majesty against the Enemies Ships at  Dunkirk  and in the  Channel  Here seemeth a most convincing Proof of the Matter of Fact Now let us see what  Dutch  Cunning will bring them off of this for it is a home Charge and they will not easily parry the Thrust The  Memorial  in Truth does not attempt it and therefore the Matter of Fact as I said before stands granted But they plead then that we have not treated them fairly for say they  'Secondly It must be observ'd that in the aforesaid Account Notice is taken only of the Ships of this State which in Conjunction with those of Her Majesty were employ'd in the  Mediterr anean  and the  Channel  and that the North Sea which this State during the War has generally had the Care of is wholly omitted Which Mention of those Ships only of this State which have acted in Conjunction with those of Her Majesty and the Omission of the North Sea make so great a Difference between the Number of Ships reckoned by the foresaid Account to have been furnished by  GreatBritain  and that said in the same Account to be furnished by this State that probably this Difference gave Occasion to the forming the foresaid prejudicial Resolution or Vote of the  Lower House which possibly would not have been formed might this State have first been heard upon it'  This Plea needs no farther Examination than to look back to the Second Paragraph of the Admiralty's Report above where it is affirm'd  'That by the Treaties between the Queen of  GreatBritain  and the StatesGeneral their Proportion of Ships of the Line of Battle to act in Conjunction with those of this Kingdom in the  Channel  and in about the  Mediterranean  ought to be Three to our Five'  It must be surprizing to all that read the  Memorial  of the States to hear them insist with so many Introductory Paragraphs and lay so much stress upon their Employing Ships in the North Seas when it is thus proved that the North Seas are quite left out of the Question and the Treaties they had made were only for Ships to be employ'd  in the Channel in and about the Mediterranean  Now if they have furnished their Quota as agreed upon with us for the  Channel  and the  Mediterranean  tho' they had sent no Ships to the North Seas we conceive the Commons had made no Representation nor had they any Reason for there was no mention of it in the Agreements of Treaties aforesaid but if they have not furnished their Quota's for the  Channel  altho' they had sent an Hundred Sail to the North Seas it had been nothing to the Case any more  than their sending Ships to  Batavia  for the same Reason as above the North Sea Guard being not mention'd in the said Treaties and Annual Agreements To what Purpose then is all the long Description of the Necessity of the sending Ships to the North Seas And what can be more surprizing than to find their High Mightinesses arguing what  is  or  was  their Sentiments against what  is  and  was  at that very Time  concerted  and  adjusted  by them with the Persons actually sent over by the Queen of  GreatBritain  for that Purpose and which in the very same Paragraph they acknowledge was so  concerted  and  adjusted  For the more ready assisting the Reader to make a Full and Free Judgment hereof the long pretended Defence on that Head is here copied out of the said  Memorial  and is as follows  viz  'It must be observ'd That by the Seventh Article of the Treaty of the Ninth of  June  by which that Agreement was renewed 'Tis provided that the Number of Ships of War to be furnished by each for their whole Quota according to the said Agreement should be regulated every Year and that the Rendezvous as well as the Places where the Ships should be employed should likewise be agreed upon every Year accordingly this has been concerted Yearly Her Majesty having to that Purpose for several Years sent over one of Her Admirals at which  Times Two Things principally were taken into Deliberation namely the Number of Shipping and the Places where they should be employ'd upon which the Projects on the Part of Her Majesty proposed commonly the employing a greater Number than was proposed by this State and also more Regard was had to the  Channel  than to the North Sea of which North Sea not the least Mention is made in the aforesaid Account of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty from which Omission it partly comes that they reckon so low what this State has furnished to the Seaservice The Sentiment of this State upon this Subject has alway been that the Number of Ships to be sent Yearly to Sea ought to be regulated according to the Force which it might reasonably be judged the Enemy could Yearly bring into the  Mediterranean  the  Channel  and the North Sea so that Men might be morally sure that the Fleets and Squadrons which on the Part of  GreatBritain  and this State should act in Conjunction or Seperately would be superiour to those of the Enemy The Term in Conjunction or Separately was used because it was ever the Opinion of this State that Her Majesty's Ships and those of this State sent to  Portugal  and the  Mediterranean  ought to act in Conjunction and that the Security of the  Channel  ought to be left to the Care of Her Majesty  and that of the North Sea to the Care of this State because the  Channel  is best situate for  GreatBritain  with respect to its Countries Harbours and Commerce and the North Sea for this State with respect to its Countries Harbours and Commerce yet so that if unexpectedly the Enemy should bring any Fleet or considerable Squadrons into the  Channel  or into the North Sea then the Squadrons on both Sides in Whole or in Part according to the Circumstances of Affairs might join each other'  It is observed here the States General First acknowledge in this Paragraph of their  Memorial  That  both the Number of Ships to be furnish'd by each Party and the Places where those Ships should be employ'd was concerted Yearly Her Majesty having to that Purpose for several Years sent over one of Her Admirals  Nay they repeat it again  viz At which Times Two Things principally were taken into Deliberation  viz  The Number of Shipping and the Places where they should be employ'd  We can have no Occasion to make Answer to this in any other Manner than by Appeal to the StatesGeneral themselves and Enquiring then whether in the Quota's of Ships at those Times agreed on and the Place where they should be employ'd any Place but the  Channel  and in and about the  Mediterranean  was ever included or incerted If it were  then we must give it against the Representation of the House of Commons and acquit the StatesGeneral But if not what means all the Preamble and Circumlocution of this long  Memorial  And to what Purpose is it said this or that was the Sentiments of the StatesGeneral The Representation and Address of the Commons and the Report of the  British  Admiralty can say nothing to what was or was not the Sentiments of the StatesGeneral But to what was their Agreement and what was concerted Yearly between the Queen of  GreatBritain  and the States that they may enquire about and that they do represent Fairly and Faithfully  viz  That the  Dutch  have not furnished the Quota's which they were obliged by Treaty to do for the Service of the Consederates in the  Channel  and in or about the  Mediterranean  what they did in the North Seas as being no Part of the said Agreement the said Representation has no Ground to meddle with it nor does it take the least Notice of it as is supposed for that Reason  It may not be foreign to this Case to enquire a little here into the Reason and Equity also of this Argument about the North S as Service in doing whereof if it shall be found that this Service ought not to be thought of in Establishing the said Quota's of Ships as being wholly and solely a Work of Interest Protecting their own  Commerce Fishing  c  in which the Allies have no Concern and that the  English  had at the same Time several Squadrons in those Seas which were never esteemed Part of the said Quota on the  British  Side and therefore that the like ought not to be insisted on on the Part of the StatesGeneral then all the Argument drawn from these Things will fall to the Ground and the Impressions which those Resolutions of the House of Commons have made on the People must necessarily remain  It is not question'd at all nor does it seem material to this Case but that in the several Alliances made between  England  and the StatesGeneral they were Mutually oblig'd to assist each other with  all their Forces  But this is so far from taking off the Edge of the Complaint that it rather fixes and confirms the same for that we alledge that the  Dutch  have not assisted with all their Forces and to determine the Signification of the said Term and how the same is to be understood we are to observe that lest it should create hereafter any Misunderstanding among the Allies the several Quota's or Proportions of the Allies were settled between every the particular Nations Annually Now the Parliament's Complaint is clear in this nor does the  Memorial  of the States offer one Word of Answer to it they do not complain in general that the States have not  supply'd their whole Forces but that they have not supply'd those several Proportions by which their whole Forces were by vertue of their Subsequent Agreement to be understood and this appears from the very  Memorial  itself where their High Mightinesses acknowledge it and better Proof cannot be desired See their own Words  'By the Seventh Article of the Treaty of the Ninth of  June  by which that Agreement was renewed 'tis provided that the Number of Ships of War to be furnished by each for their whole Quota according to the said Agreement should be regulated every Year and that the Rendezvous as well as the Places where the Ships should be employed should likewise be agreed upon every Year accordingly this has been concerted Yearly Her Majesty having to that Purpose for several Years sent over one of Her Admirals at which Times Two Things principally were taken into Deliberation namely the Number of Shipping and the Places where they should be employ'd'  Here it is acknowledg'd by the States that the Quota's were adjusted between us and them both as to Number of Ships and where to be employ'd There are but Two Objections which the  Memorial  pretends to make after this the First is Whether the Ships which the States furnished  for the Guard of the North Seas should not be esteemed Part of their Quota and Secondly Whether the Number of Ships mentioned to be employ'd by Her Majesty in the  Channel  and in the  Mediterranean  were necessary these are also their own Words to which may be briefly answer'd First That after they had acknowledged as above is said That  the Number of Ships and Places where the same should be employ'd were every Year concerted  it can no more be asked whether they were necessary the Question rather lyes fairly Whether the Numbers concerted were respectively supply'd if there had appear'd any subsequent Alteration in the Face of the War So that if it had seem'd to the States less necessary to send so large a Number of Ships as was agreed it must have been reasonable that a new Concert between the Allies should have been made and some mutual Agreement offer'd for lessening the said Number on both Sides But to agree First that such a Number on both Sides should be supplied and then shortning that Number on their Side without signifying to the  British  Court that they thought fewer Ships enough so that the  British  should be left to send their full Quota as agreed and the States only make an Abatement this can be no Fair Treatment of the  British  nor is it esteemed fair Dealing in our Country whatever it may be in  Holland    therefore the Complaint of the Commons in this Case seems very just and is not at all answer'd by this  Memorial  for that the StatesGeneral did not supply the Number of Ships which by their Annual Agreement was concerted between them and Her Majesty Secondly But say the States we did supply a great Squadron in the North Seas which ought to be esteemed a Part of our Proportion and all the Reasons given for this Way of acting are that such were the Sentiments of the StatesGeneral yet in another Part of the said  Memorial  it is own'd and in the Report of the Commissioners of the Admiralty it is expresly said those Quota's were settled only for such Ships as were to act Conjunctly or Separately in the  Channel  and the  Mediterranean  But because this Argument is of too much Value to have it depend upon the dubious Construction of Terms it may be observ'd First That there is no Parity or Equality in this Argument for that the Concert of Proportions of Ships to be supply'd by us and the States respected only the particular Seas in which the Power of the  French  was particularly Formidable and where their main Fleets were to be expected as in the  Streights  and the  Channel  or on the Coasts of  Portugal  and  Spain  And that the  British  Nation have kept great Squadrons and Fleets out in sundry other Parts of the World as the  Dutch  have done in the  North Sea  without reckoning any such Ships into the Quota or Proportions of the Fleets to be furnished as before for the Carrying on the War such have been the Fleets and Ships constantly sent to the  WestIndies  to  St Helena  to the  Canaries  c by which it appears that whatever the Sentiments of the States of  Holland  have been as above the Sentiments of the  British  Court have always been that each Ally ought to have supply'd their full Quota of such Ships as were concerted for the Service of the War in the  Channel  and in the  Mediterranean  without esteeming such Ships as Part thereof which they respectively were obliged to furnish for the Protection of their Commerce in any other Part of the World and that this was the real Sentiments of the StatesGeneral as well as of Her Majesty appears for that in all the Ships sent by either of the Powers into other Parts of the World as into the North Seas the  Baltick  the  WestIndies    St Helena  and the like they very seldom acted in Conjunction but sent their respective Squadrons separately as the Necessity of their Affairs requir'd Nor did those Ships act in Conjunction on any Occasion save only as they found it necessary to take the Ships of each other Nation under Convoy or in their Protection and made use of the Harbours of each Confederate as there  might be Occasion This is manifest in that notwithstanding the great Fleets which the StatesGeneral have upon all Occasions sent to the North Seas as is alledg'd the  British  Court have been oblig'd also to send Annual Squadrons to those Seas for the Safety of their Trade as well to  Russia  as to the  EastCountry  the  Elbe  and the  Weser  as also for the Defence of the Coast of  Scotland  and  Ireland  which Ships tho' equal if not superiour to the Numbers sent into those Seas by the StatesGeneral have not been accounted by Her Maj  sty as any Part of the Proportion of Ships concerted as abovesaid with the States  This therefore can never be the Reason of the Report of the Commissioners of the Admiralty and it is surprizing to all those who know the State of those Things to hear the  Memorial  say the States General had the Care of the North Seas as they do when they sum up that Part of their Case as follows  viz  'It must be observed that in the aforesaid Account Notice is taken only of the Ships of this State which in Conjunction with those of Her Majesty were employed in the  Mediterranean  and the  Channel  and that the North Sea which this State during the War has generally had the Care of is wholly omitted Which Two Things namely the Mention of those  Ships only of this State which have acted in Conjunction with those of Her Majesty and the Omission of the North Sea make so great a Difference between the Number of Ships reckoned by the foresaid Account to have been furnished by this State that probably this Difference gave Occasion to the forming the foresaid prejudicial Resolution or Vote of the Lower House which possibly would not have been formed might this State have first been heard upon it'  It should seem Needful here to enter into an Enquiry what Number of Ships Her Majesty has from Time to Time sent into the North Seas and how the StatesGeneral may be said to have had the Care of the North Seas when it is well known the  British  Trade nay and even often the  Dutch  to  ArchAngel  have been Convoy'd Out and Home by Her Majesty's Ships and the Coast of  Scotland  the Mouth of the  Baltick  and the  Elbe  have been constantly Guarded by the  British  Ships  Thus by the plainest Reasoning in the World the  Memorial  is fallacious for that the Desiciencies complain'd of remain consest by the States themselves the Reasons pretended to justify themselves are directly contrary to the concerted Proportions and Treaties made between the said StatesGeneral and the Queen's Majesty  and this is exactly agreeable to the Report of the Commissioners of the Admiralty and the Resolutions of the House of Commons  The like fallacious Way of Arguing appears in the Case of the LandForces or Troops in which still their High Mightinesses do not deny the Matter of Fact alledged in the said Address but excuse and extenuate the same by their Efforts otherways as particularly they alledge an Article of their Raising Troops before us and this they say deserves some Compensation  that is  that they having raised Fifty Thousand Men before us they should be therefore allowed to maintain Fewer than they agreed for afterwards or to speak plainly that because they were obliged to a quicker Armament than the  British  therefore they were to have leave to break in upon future Concert and fail in the Numbers they were to bring in afterward This seems no unfair Construction of the First Clause of the  Memorial  relating to the Troops which is as follows  'In the First Place it must not be omitted to observe on the said Estimate that in the general Charge for the Year the Fortyfour Thousand Nine Hundred Ninetytwo Men which the  ƲnitedNetherlands  kept up after the Peace of  Ryswick  are mixed with the  Thirtyfour Thousand Eight Hundred Sixtysix Men which were taken into Service immediately after the Death of  Charles  the Second King of  Spain  and that for the Year not only the Troops which this State took into Service that Year but those hired the Beginning of the foregoing Year are reckon'd all together which if put down more distinctly would have shewn that this State had reinforced their I roops with above Fifty Thousand Men a considerable Time before  GreatBritain  came to make any particular Augmentation which earlier Arming to the excessive Expence of this State well deserved to be allowed for by some kind of Compensation'  What can the Words  deserve some Compensation  be suppos'd to signify but that the StatesGeneral concluded from thence that their future Deficiency was to be allow'd because of their more Arming than the  English  Which any one that remembers the Occasion may find other Reasons to give for and which the StatesGeneral themselves seem to acknowledge or at least to hint at which was in short that the Parliament and People of  England  did not come into the Measures for the last War or perhaps believe it so necessary at first as the States did and therefore did not Vote such large Sums  for their Proportion as the StatesGeneral requir'd and this they now alledge should be made up afterwards This is gathered from the following Words in the  Memorial  'This State were obliged to be content with  GreatBritain's  furnishing in the Beginning of the War no more than Forty Thousand Men in the  Netherlands  in so great a Disproportion with respect to this State not because there was any Convention or Agreement made about it or that it was at all reasonable but because no more was consented to by the Parliament the Reasons of which are probable fresh still in the Remembrance of many and at that Time the only Course this State could take was to burthen itself with so great a Disproportion and to wait till in the Continuance of the War it should be made good to them'  This may imply that the StatesGeneral desired to have this Disproportion made good to them afterwards by the  English  but does not prove that it ought to have been made good or that the Queen of  GreatBritian  had agreed to make it good much less did it signifie that they were thereby Entituled to make it good to themselves by a Deficiency in such Quota's and Proportions as they  should agree afterwards to bring into the Field  Upon the whole then it seems the Sum of the Case is this that the  Dutch  have really been Deficient in the said Quota's but that according to their own Sentiments they might lawfully be so notwithstanding express Treaties and Conventions to the contrary and that these Sentiments arise from their thinking fit to make Reprizal or Stoppage upon  England  for the  Dutch  coming into the War a Year before us and because we did not think fit to come into the Alliance sooner they are making us pay for our standing out  More or less than this cannot be made of their long  Memorial  and as to the Justice and Equity of this the World is left to judge of that Affair  The Author of this had resolved to add here some Remarks about the Pretence of carrying on the War with all their Forces and the States saying that  Britain  is more Powerful and therefore must bring in more Forces making themselves Judges of who is or is not most Powerful but Her Majesty's Answer to the States since published has made this so clear and prest it so close upon the  Dutch  that it seems needless to say any more to that Point  FINIS
