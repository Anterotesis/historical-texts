 EPISTLES TO SEVERAL PERSONS  Est brevitate opus ut currat sententia neu se  Impediat verbis lassis onerantibus aures  Et sermone opus est modo tristi saepe jocoso  Defendente vicem modo Rhetoris atque Poetae  Interdum urbani parcentis viribus atque  Extenuantis eas consultò  HOR  ADVERTISEMENT  THE ESSAY ON MAN was intended to have been comprised in Four Books  The  First  of which the Author has given us under that title in four Epistles The  Second  was to have consisted of the same number Of the extent and limits of human Reason Of those Arts and Sciences and of the parts of them which are useful and therefore attainable together with those which are unuseful and therefore unattainable Of the Nature Ends Use and Application of the different Capacities of Men Of the Use of Learning of the Science of the World and of Wit concluding with a Satyr against the Misapplication of them illustrated by Pictures Characters and Examples  The  Third  Book regarded Civil Regimen or the Science of Politics in which the several forms of a Republic were to have been examined and explained together with the several Modes of Religious Worship as far forth as they affect Society between which the Author always supposed there was the most interesting relation and closest connection so that this part would have treated of Civil and Religious Society in their full extent  The  Fourth  and last Book concerned private Ethics or practical Morality considered in all the Circumstances Orders Professions and Stations of human Life  The Scheme of all this had been maturely digested and communicated to the L Bolinbroke Dr Swift and one or two more and was intended for the only work of his riper Years But was partly thro' ill health partly thro' discouragements from the depravity of the times and partly on prudential and other considerations interrupted postponed and lastly in a manner laid aside  But as this was the Author's favourite Work which more exactly reflected the Image of his strong capacious Mind and as we can have but a very imperfect idea of it from the  disjecta membra Poetae  that now remain it may not be amiss to be a little more particular concerning each of these projected books  The FIRST as it treats of Man in the abstract and considers him in general under every of his relations becomes the foundation and furnishes out the subjects of the  three  following so that  The SECOND Book takes up again the  First  and  Second  Epistles of the  First  Book and treats of man in his intellectual Capacity at large as has been explained above Of this only a small part of the conclusion which as we said was to have contained a Satyr against the misapplication of Wit and Learning may be found in the  Fourth  Book of the  Dunciad  and up and down occasionally in the other  three  The  Third  Book in like manner reassumes the subject of the  Third  Epistle of the  First  which treats of Man in his Social Political and Religious Capacity But this part the Poet afterwards conceived might be best executed in an EPIC POEM as the Action would make it more animated and the Fable less invidious in which all the great Principles of true and false Governments and Religions should be chiefly delivered in feigned Examples In pursuance of this design he plan'd out a Poem on the subject of the fabulous BRUTUS the great Grandson of Aeneas whose first and predominant principle he makes to be Benevolence from this Ruling Passion arises a strong desire to redeem the remains of his countrymen then captives amongst the Greeks from slavery and misery and to establish their freedom and felicity on a just form of Civil Government He had seen how false Policy and Superstitions and Vices proceeding from it had caused the ruin of Troy and he was enabled to avoid the  one  by the lights his countrymen whom he had now gathered from their dispersion could afford him from their observations on the various policies of the Grecian Cities and to reform the  other  by the Wisdom he himself had gained in Italy where Evander as we are told by Virgil had reformed the reigning Superstitions  Rex Evandrus ait non haec sollemnia nobis  Vana superstitio veterumque ignara Deorum  Imposuit  Thus qualified for the office of Legislation he puts to sea with a number of brave followers enters the Atlantic Ocean and after various traverses each of which produces some new lesson of Politics he arrives in Britain where having surmounted many successive difficulties which bring him still nearer and nearer to the point the poet aims at he at length establishes for his Trojans that perfect form of Civil Government which it was our author's purpose to recommend The poem opens of which very few lines of the introduction only were written with Brutus at the Straits of Calpé in sight of the  ne plus ultra  on Hercules's Pillars debating in councel whether he should enter the great ocean  The FOURTH and last Book pursues the subject of the  Fourth  Epistle of the  First  and treats of  Ethics  or practical Morality and would have consisted of many members of of which the four following Epistles were detached Portions the  two first  on the  Characters of Men and Women  being the  introductory  part of this concluding Book  EPISTLE I  To Sir RICHARD TEMPLE Lord Viscount COBHAM  ARGUMENT of the FIRST EPISTLE  Of the  Knowledge  and

difficulties in coming at the  Knowledge  and true  Characters of Men  The Second from ℣ to of the  wrong means  which both  Philosophers  and  Men of the World  have employed in surmounting those difficulties And the Third from ℣ to the end treats of the  right means  with directions for the application of them  I  VER  Yes you despise the man  c  The Epistle is introduced from ℣ to in observing that the  Knowledge of Men  is neither to be gained by Books nor Experience alone but by the joint use of both for that the  Maxims  of the  Philosopher  and the  Conclusions  of the  Man of the World  can separately but supply a vague and superficial knowledge And often not so much as those  Maxims  are founded in the abstract  notions  of the writer and these  conclusions  are drawn from the uncertain  conjectures  of the observer But when the writer joins his  speculation  to the  experience  of the observer his  notions  are rectified into  principles  and when the observer regulates his  experience  on the  general principles  of the writer his  conjectures  advance into  science  Such is the reasoning of this introduction which besides its propriety to the general subject of the Epistle has a peculiar relation to each of its parts or members For the  causes of the difficulty  in coming at the knowledge and characters of men explained in the First will shew the importance of what is here delivered of the  joint  assistance  of speculation and practice to surmount it and the  wrong means  which both  philosophers  and  men of the world  have employed in overcoming those difficulties discoursed of in the Second have their source here deduced which is seen to be a  separate  adherence of each to his own method of studying men and a mutual contempt of the others Lastly the  right means  delivered in the Third will be of little use in the application without the direction here delivered For tho'  observation  discovered a  ruling passion  yet without a  philosophic  knowledge of the human mind we may easily mistake a  secondary  and  subsidiary  passion for the  principal  and so be never the nearer in the Knowledge of Men But the elegant and easy  Form  of the  introduction  equals the Propriety of its  matter  for the Epistle being addressed to a noble person distinguished for his knowledge of the World it opens as it were in the midst of a familiar converse which lets us at once into his character where the poet by affecting  only  to ridicule the useless Knowledge of Men confined to Books and under the appearance of extolling only that acquired by the World artfully insinuates how equally defective this may be when conducted on the same narrow principle Which is too often the case as  men of the world  are more than ordinarily prejudiced in favour of their own observations for the sake of the observer and for the same reason less indulgent to the discoveries of others  VER  There's some peculiar  c  The poet enters on the First division of his subject  the difficulties of coming at the Knowledge and true Characters of Men  The I cause of this difficulty which he prosecutes from ℣ to is the great  diversity of Characters  of which to abate our wonder and not discourage our inquiry he only desires we would  grant  him  but as many sorts of Mind as Moss  Hereby artfully insinuating that if Nature has varied the most worthless vegetable into above three hundred species we need not wonder at the like diversity in the human mind And if a variety in that vegetable has been thought of importance enough to employ the leisure of a serious enquirer much more will the same quality in this masterpiece of Nature deserve our study and attention  VER  That each from other differs c    A second cause of this difficulty from ℣ to is  Man's inconstancy  whereby not only one man differs from another but each man from himself  VER  Add Nature's c    A third cause from ℣ to is that  obscurity  thrown over the Characters of men thro' the strife and contest between  nature  and  custom  between  reason  and  appetite  between  truth  and  opinion  And as most men  either thro'  education    temperature  or  profession  have their Characters warp'd by  custom    appetite  and  opinion  the obscurity arising from thence almost universal  VER  Our depths who fathoms c    A fourth cause from ℣ to is deep  dissimulation  and restless  caprice  whereby the shallows of the mind are as difficult to be  found  as the depths of it to be  fathom'd  VER  On human actions c    A fifth cause from ℣ to is the sudden change of his  Principle of action  either on the point of its being laid open and detected or thro' mere inconstancy  VER  Yet more the difference c    Hitherto the poet hath spoken of the causes of difficulty arising from the  obseurity of the Object  he now comes to those which proceed from  defects in the Observer  The First of which and a sixth cause of difficulty he shews from ℣ to is the perverse  manners    affections  and  imagination  of the observer whereby the Characters of others are rarely seen either in their true  light    complexion  or  proportion  VER  Nor will Life's stream for Observation c    The Second of these and seventh cause of difficulty from ℣ to is the  shortness of human life  which will not suffer the observer to select and weigh out his knowledge but just to snatch it as it rolls rapidly by him down the current of Time  VER  Oft in the Passions' c    We come now to the eighth and last cause which very properly concludes the account as in a sort it sums up all the difficulties in one from ℣ to namely that very often the  man himself is ignorant of his own motive of action  the cause of which ignorance our author has admirably explain'd When the mind says he is now quite tired out by the long conflict of opposite motives it withdraws its attention and suffers the  will  to be seized upon by the first that afterwards obtrudes itself without taking notice what that motive is This is finely illustrated by what he supposes the general cause of dreams where the fancy just let loose possesses itself of the  last image  which it meets with on the confines between sleep and waking and on that eracts all its visionary operation yet this image is with great difficulty recollected and never but when some accident happens to interrupt our first slumbers Then which proves the truth of the hypothesis we are sometimes able to trace the workings of the Fancy backwards from image to image in a chain till we come to that from whence they all arose  VER  True some are open c    But now in answer to all this an  objector  as the author shews from ℣ to may say  "That these difficulties seem to be aggravated For many Characters are so plainly marked that no man can mistake them And not so only in the more  open  and  frank  but in the very  closest  and most  recluse  likewise"  Of each of which the objector gives an instance whereby it appears that the forbidding closeness and concealed hypocrisy in the one are as conspicuous to all mankind as the gracious openness and frank plaindealing of the other The Reader sees this objection is more particularly level'd at the doctrine of ℣  Our  depths  who fathoms and our  shallows  finds  for it here endeavours to prove that both are equally explorable  VER  But these plain Characters c    To this objection therefore our author replies from ℣ to that indeed the fact may be true in the instances given but that such  plain characters  are extremely rare And for the truth of this he not only appeals to experience but explains the causes of it The First of which is the  vivacity of the Imagination  for that when the bias of the Passions is enough determined to mark out the Character yet then as the vigour of the Fancy generally rises in proportion to the strength of the Appetites the one no sooner directs the bias than the other reverses it  Tho'  strong  the bent yet  quick  the turns of mind  A Second cause is the  contrariety of Appetites  which drawing several ways as  Avarice  and  Luxury    Ambition  and  Indolence    c  they must needs make the same Character inconsistent to itself and consequently inexplicable to the observer  Or puzzling  Contraries  confound the whole  VER  Or Affectations c    A Third cause is  Affectation  that aspires to qualities which neither  nature  nor  education  has given us and which consequently neither  art  nor  use  will ever render graceful or becoming On this account it is he well observes that  Affectation reverses the soul  other  natural passions  may indeed turn it from that bias which the  ruling one  has given it but the  affected passions  distort all its faculties and cramp all its operations so that it acts with the same constraint that a tumbler walks upon his hands  VER  Unthought of frailties c    A Fourth cause lies in the  Inequalities  the human mind  which expose the  wise  to unexpected frailties and conduct the  to as unlooked for wisdom  VER  See the same man c    Of all these Four  causes  he here gives examples Of the  vivacity of the Imagination  from ℣ to Of the  contrariety of Appetites  from ℣ to Of  Affectation  from ℣ to and Of the  Inequalities of the human mind  from ℣ to  VER  Know God and Nature c    Having thus proved what he had proposed the  premisses  naturally lead him into a moral reflexion with which he concludes his  first part  namely that constancy is to be expected in no human Character whatsoever  but to be found only in God and his Laws That as to Man he is not only perpetually shifting and varying even while  within the verge  of his own nature but is frequently flying out into each extreme both  above  and  below  it Now associating in good earnest with Brutes and now again affecting the imaginary coversation of Angels See  Essay on Man  Ep ii ℣  A bird of passage gone as soon as found  Now in the  Moon  perhaps now  under ground  II  VER  In vain the Sage c    The author having shewn the difficulties in coming to the Knowledge and true Characters of men enters now upon the  second division  of his Poem which is  of the wrong means that both Philosophers and Men of the world have employed in surmounting those difficulties  He had in the Introduction spoken of the absurd conduct of both in despising the assistance of each other He now justifies his censure by an examination of their peculiar doctrines and to take them in their own way considers them as they would be considered  separately  And  first  of the  Philosopher  whose principal mistake is in supposing  that Actions best decipher  the  Motive of the actor  This he confutes from ℣ to by shewing that  different Actions  proceed often from the  same motive  whether of  accident  as disappointed views or of  temperature  as an adust complexion which he thus illustrates  Behold if Fortune or a Mistress frown c  In judging therefore of  Motives  by  Actions  the Philosopher must needs be frequently misled because the passion or appetite which when impelling to  Action  we call the  Motive  may be equally gratified in the pursuit of quite different measures  VER  Not always Actions shew the man c    The Philosopher's  second  mistake is that  Actions decipher the character of the actor  This too the author confutes from ℣ to and as in correcting the foregoing mistake he proved  that different Actions often proceed from the same Motive  so here he proves  that the same Actions often proceeds from different Motives  thus a  kind Action  he observes as commonly arises from the accidents of prosperity or fine weather as from a natural disposition to humanity a  modest Action  as well from pride as humility a  brave Action  as easily from habit or fashion as magnanimity and a  prudent Action  as often from vanity as wisdom Now the  Character  being really determined by the  Motives  and various nay contrary  Motives  producing the same  Action  the  Action  can never decipher the  Character of the actor  But further continues the poet if we attend to what has been said we shall discover another circumstance in the case that will not only make it extremely difficult but absolutely impracticable to decipher the Character by the Action and that is  the  discordancy of Action  in the same Character a necessary consequence of the two principles proved above that  different Actions proceed from the same Motive  and that  the same Action proceeds from different Motives  VER  But grant that Actions c    If you will judge of man by his  Actions  you are not to selected such only as you like or can manage you must fairly take all you find But when you have got these together they will prove so very discordant that no consistent Character can possibly be made out of them What is then to be done Will you  suppress  all those you cannot reconcile to the few capital Actions which you chuse for the foundation of your Character But this the laws of truth will not allow of Will you then miscall them and say they were not the natural workings of the man but the disguises of the politician But what will you get by that but the very reversing the best known Character and making the owner of it the direct opposite of himself And this says our author the reasoning and philosophic historian has always been ready to do with the  Actions  of great men of which he gives two famous instances in the life of Caefar The conclusion from the whole is that  Actions do not shew the Man  VER  'Tis from high Life c    The poet having done with the  Philosopher  now turns to the  Man of the world  whose  first  mistake is in supposing men's true  Characters may be known by their station  This tho' a mere mobopinion is the opinion in fashion and cherished by the Mob of all ranks therefore tho' beneath the poet's reasoning he thought it deserving of his ridicule and the strongest was what  he gives from ℣ to a naked exposition of the fact to which he has subjoined from ℣ to an ironical apology that as Virtue is cultivated with infinitely more labour in Courts than in Cottages it is but just to set an infinitely higher value on it which says he with much pleasantry is most agreeable to all the fashionable ways of estimation For why do the connoisseurs prefer the lively colour in a Gem before that in a Flower but for its extreme rarity and difficulty of production  VER  'Tis Education forms c    This  second  mistake of the  Man of the  world  is more serious it is that  Characters are best judged of by the general Manners  This the poet confutes in a lively enumeration of examples from ℣ to which shew that how similar or different soever the  Manners  be by  Nature  yet they are all new model'd by  Education  and  Profession  where each man invariably receives that exotic form which the mould he falls into is fitted to imprint The  natural Character  therefore can never be judged of by these  fictitious Manners  VER  Ask mens Opinions c    The  third  mistake is in judging of mens Characters by their  Opinions and turn of thinking  But these the poet shews by two examples from ℣ to are generally swayed by  Interest  both in the  affairs of Life  and  Speculation  VER  Judge we by Nature c    The poet having gone thro' the  mistakes  both of the  Philosopher  and  Man of the world  turns now to  both  and from ℣ to jointly addresses them in a  recapitulation  of his reasoning against  both  He shews that if we pretend to disenvelope the  Character  by the  natural disposition in general  we shall find it extremely difficult because this is often  effaced  by  Habit    overswayed  by  Interest  and  suspended  by  Policy  If by  Actions  their contrariety will leave us in utter doubt and uncertainty If by  Passions  we shall be perpetually misled by the mask of  Dissimulation  If by  Opinions  all these things concur together to perplex the enquiry Shew us therefore says he in the whole range of your  Philosophy  and  Experience  the thing we can be  certain  of For to sum up all in a word  Manners  with Fortunes  Humours  turn with Climes  Tenets  with Books and  Principles  with Times  We must seek therefore some other rout to the point we aim at  III  VER  Search then the Ruling Passion c    And now we enter on the  third  and last part which treats of the  right means  of surmounting the difficulties in coming to the  Knowledge  and  Characters of men  This the poet shews is  by investigating the  RULING PASSION of whose origin and nature we may find an exact account in the second Ep of the  Essay on Man  This  Principle  he rightly observes from ℣ to is the clue that must guide us thro' all the intricacies in the ways of men To  convince us of which he applies it from ℣ to to the most wild and inconsistent Character that ever was which when drawn out at length in a spirit of poetry as rare as the character itself we see this  Principle  unravels and renders throughout of one plain consistent thread  VER  Yet in the search c    But here from ℣ to he gives one very necessary caution that in developing the  Ruling Passion  we must be careful not to mistake a  subsidiary  passion for the  principal  which without great attention we may be very liable to do as the  subsidiary  acting in support of the  principal  has frequently all its  vigour  and much of its  perseverance  This error has misled several both of the ancient and modern historians as when they supposed  Lust  and  Luxury  to be  Characteristics of  Caesar  and  Lucullus  whereas in truth the  Ruling Passion  of both was  Ambition  which is so certain that at whatsoever different time of the Republic these men had lived their  Ambition  as the  Ruling Passion  had been the same but a different time had changed their  subsidiary  ones of  Lust  and  Luxury  into their very opposites of  Chastity  and  Frugality  'Tis in vain therefore says our author for the observer of human nature to six his attention on the  Workman  if he all the while mistakes the  Scaffold  for the  Building  VER  In this one Passion c    But now it may be objected to our philosophic poet that he has indeed shewn  the true means  of coming to  the Knowledge and Characters of men  by a  Principle  certain and infallible when found yet by his own account of so difficult investigation that its  Counterfeit  and it is always attended with one may be easily mistaken for it To remove this difficulty therefore and consequently the objection that arises from it the poet has given from ℣ to one certain and infallible criterion of the  Ruling Passion  which is this that all the  other  passions in the course of time change and wear away while  this  is ever constant and vigorous and still going on from strength to strength to the very moment of its demolishing the miserable machine that it has now at length overworked Of this great truth the poet from ℣ to the end gives various instances in all the  principal  Ruling Passions  of our nature as they are to be found in the  Man of Business  the  Man of Pleasure  the  Epicure  the  Parcimonious  the  Toast  the  Courtier  the  Miser  and the  Patriot  which last instance the poet has had the art under the appearance of Satyr to turn into the noblest Compliment on the person to whom the Epistle is addressed  NOTES  VER  And yet Men may be read as well as Books too much c    The poet has here covertly described a famous system of a  man of the world  the celebrated  Maxims of M de la Rochefoucault  which are one continued  satyr  on human Nature and hold much of the ill language of the Parrat The  reason  of the censure our author's system of human Nature will explain  VER  And all Opinion's colours cast on life    The Poet refers here only to the  effects  In the  Essay on Man  he gives both the  efficient  and the  final cause  The First in the third Ep ℣  E'er Wit oblique had broke that steddy light  For  oblique Wit  is  Opinion  The other in the second Ep ℣  Meanwhile Opinion gilds with varying rays  These painted clouds that beautify our days c  VER  It may be reason but it is not man    i e  The Philospher may invent a  rational hypothesis  that shall account for the appearances he would investigate and yet that  hypothesis  be all the while very wide of  truth  and the  nature of things  VER  Like following life thro' creatures you dissect  You loss it in the moment you detect    This Simile is extremely beautiful To shew the difficulty of discovering the operations of the heart in a  moral sense  he illustrates it by another attempt still more difficult the discovery of its operations in a  natural  For the seat of animal life being in the  heart  our endeavours of tracing it thither must necessarily drive it from thence  VER  All Manners take a  tincture  from our own  Or come  discolour'd  thro' our Passions shown    These two lines are remarkable for the exactness and propriety of expression The word  tincture  which implies a weak colour given by degrees well describes the influence of the  Manners  and the word  discolour  which implies a quicker change and by a deeper dye denotes as well the operation of the  Passions  VER  say Montagne or more sage Charron    Charron was an admirer of Montagne had contracted a strict friendship with him and has transferred an infinite number of his thoughts into his famous book  De la Sagesse  but his moderating everywhere the extravagant Pyrrhonism of his friend is the reason why the poet calls him  more sage Charron  VER  A perjur'd Prince    Louis XI of France wore in his Hat a leaden image of the Virgin Mary which when he swore by he feared to break his oath  VER  A godless Regent tremble at a Star    Philip Duke of Orleans Regent of France in the minority of Louis XV superstitious in judicial astrology tho' an unbeliever in all religion The same has been observed of many other  Politicians  The Italians in general are not more noted for their refined  Politics  than for their attachment to the dotages of  Astrology  It may be worth while to enquire into the cause of so singular a phenomenon as it may probably turn out to the honour of Religion I take then the case to be this These men observing and none have equal opportunities how perpetually public events fall out besides their expectation and contrary to the bestlaid schemes of worldly policy cannot but confess that human affairs are ordered by some power extrinsical To acknowledge a God and his Providence would be next to introducing a morality destructive of that public system which they think necessary for the government of the world They have recourse therefore to that ridiculous and absurd scheme of Power which rules by no other law than  Fate  or  Destiny  The consideration of this perhaps was the reason that the poet to keep up decorum and to preserve the distinction between a  Patriot  and a  Politician  makes the sormer rely on  Providence  for the public safety in the concluding words of the Epistle  Such in those moments as in all the past  O save my Country Heaven  shall be your last  VER  The throne a Bigot keep a Genius quit    Philip V of Spain who after renouncing the throne for Religion resum'd it to gratify his Queen and Victor Amadeus II King of Sardmia who resign'd the crown and trying to reassume it was imprison'd till his death  VER  Know God and Nature c    By  Nature  is not here meant any imaginary substitute of God called a  Plastic nature  but his  moral laws  And this observation was inserted with great propriety and discretion in the conclusion of a long detail of the various characters of men For from this circumstance  Montagne  and others have been bold enough to insinuate that morality is sounded more in custom and fashion than in the nature of things The speaking therefore of a moral law of God as having all the constancy and durability of his Essence had an high expediency in this place  VER  The same adust complexion has impell'd  Charles to the Convent Philip to the Field    The atrabilaire complexion of Philip II is well known but not so well that be derived it from his father Charles V whose health the historians of his life tell us was frequently disorder'd by bilious severs But what the author meant principally to observe here was that this humour made both these princes act contrary to their Character Charles who was an active man when he retired into a Convent Philip who was a man of the Closet when he gave the battle of St Quintin  VER  Who reasons wisely c    By  reasoning  is not here meant  speculating  but deliberating and resolving in public counsels for this instance is given as  one  of a variety of  actions  VER  Caesar himself might whisper he was beat    Caesar wrote his  Commentaries  in imitation of the Greek Generals for the entertainment of the world But had his friend asked him in his ear the reason of his sudden retreat from Britain after so many signal victories we have cause to suspect even from his own public relation of that matter that he would have  whisper'd he was beat  VER  Why risque the world's great empire for a Punk    After the battle of Pharsalia Caesar pursued his enemy to Alexandria where being infatuated with the charms of Cleopatra instead of pushing his advantages and dispersing the relicks of the Pharsalian quarrel having narrowly escaped the violence of an enraged people he brought upon himself an unnecessary war at a time his arms were most wanted elsewhere  VER  Courtvirtues bear like gems c    This whole reflexion and the similitude brought to support it have a great delicacy of ridiculeA man dispos'd to cavil would fancy the similitude not exact for that the principal reason of our preferring the Gem is for its durability But does he not see it is equally for its rarity and that when once a Courtvirtue rises and comes in the way of such a lover of it as our poet it seldom sets again but bids fair for being immortal  VER  Some God or Spirit he has lately found  Or chanc'd to meet a Minister that frown'd    Disasters the most unlooked for as they were what the Freethinker's  Speculations  and  Practice  were principally directed to avoidThe poet here alludes to the ancient classical opinion that the sudden vision of a God was supposed to strike the irreverend observer speechless He has only a little extended the conceit and supposed that the terrors of a  CourtGod  might have the like effect on a very devoted worshipper  VER  Manners with Fortunes Humours change with Climes  Tenets with Books and Principles with Times    The poet had hitherto reckoned up the several  simple  causes that hinder our knowledge of the natural Characters of men In these two fine lines he describes the  complicated  causes  Humours  bear the the same relation to  Manners  that  Principles  do to  Tenets  that is the former are  modes  of the latter our  Manners  are warped from nature by our  Fortunes  or Stations our  Tenets  by our  Books  or  Professions  and then each drawn still more oblique into  humour  and political  principles  by the temperature of the  climate  and the constitution of the  government  VER  the Lust of Praise    This very well expresses the  grossness  of his appetite for it where the  strength  of the Passion had destroyed all the  delicacy  of the Sensation  VER John Willmot Earl of Rochester famous for his Wit and Extravagancies in the time of Charles the Second  VER  A  Fool  with more of  Wit  Folly  joined with much  Wit  produces that behaviour which we call  Absurdity  and this Absurdity the poet has here admirably described in the words  Too rash for Thought for Action too refin'd  by which we are made to understand that the person described gave a loose to his  Fancy  when he should have used his  Judgment  and pursued his  Speculations  when he should have trusted to his  Experience  VER  And harder still flagitious yet not great    It was indeed very hard when tho' this be the common road to  Greatness  and he had taken this road and persevered in it to the last yet that he should have the strange fortune still to miss of it  VER  'Twas all for fear c    To understand this we must observe that the  Lust of general Praise  made the person whose Character is here so admirably drawn both  extravagant  and  flagitious  his  Madness  was to please the Fools  Women  and  Fools  must like him or he dies  And his  Crimes  to avoid the censure of the Knaves  'Twas all for fear the  Knaves  should call him Fool  Prudence  and  Honesty  being the two qualities that Fools and Knaves are most interested and consequently most industrious to misrepresent  VER  Comets are regular and Wharton plain    This illustration has an exquisite beauty arising from the exactness of the analogy For as the appearance of irregularity in a Comet's motion is occasioned by the greatness of the  force  which pushes it round a very eccentric orb so it is the  violence  of the Ruling Passion that impatient for its object in the impetuosity of its course towards it is frequently hurried to an immense distance from it which occasions all that  puzzling inconsistency of conduct we observe in it  VER  Ambition was the vice    Pride    Vanity  and  Ambition  are such bordering and neighbourly vices and hold so much in common that we generally find them going together and therefore as generally mistake them for one another This does not a little contribute to our confounding Characters for they are in reality very different and distinct so much so that 'tis remarkable the three greatest men in Rome and contemporaries possessed each of these separately without the least mixture of the other two The men I mean were Caesar Cato and Cicero For Caesar had  Ambition  without either vanity or pride Cato had  Pride  without ambition or vanity and Cicero had  Vanity  without pride or ambition  VER  As Fits give vigour just when they destroy    The similitude is extremely apposite as most of the instances he has afterwards given of the vigorous exertion of the  Ruling Passion  in the last moments are from such who had hastened their death by an immoderate indulgence of  that  Passion  VER  Lanesborow    An ancient Nobleman who continued this practice long after his legs were disabled by the gout Upon the death of Prince George of Denmark he demanded an audience of the Queen to advise her to preserve her health and dispel her grief by  Dancing  VER  the last words that poor Narcissa spoke    This story as well as the others is founded on fact tho'

perhaps may be disappointed to find that this  Epistle  which proposes the same subject with the preceding is conducted on very different rules of method for instead of being disposed in the same logical connection and filled with the like philosophical remarks it is wholly taken up in drawing a great variety of capital Characters But if he would reflect that the  two Sexes  make but  one Species  and consequently that the Characters of both must be studied and explained on the same principles he would see that when the poet had done this in the preceding Epistle his business here was not to repeat what he had already delivered but only to verify and illustrate his doctrine by every  view  of that perplexity of Nature which his philosophy only can explain If the reader therefore will but be at the pains to study these Characters with any degree of attention as they are here masterly drawn one important particular for which the poet has artfully prepared him by the introduction will very forcibly strike his observation and that is that all the great strokes in the several Characters of  Women  are not only infinitely perplexed and discordant like those in  Men  but absolutely inconsistent and in a much higher degree  contradictory  As strange as this may appear yet he will see that the poet has all the while strictly follow'd Nature whose ways we find by the former Epistle  are not a little mysterious and a mystery this might have remained had not our author explained it at ℣ where he shuts up his  Characters  with this philosophical reflexion  In Men we  various ruling Passions  find  In Women  two  almost divide the kind  Those only fix'd they first or last obey  The love of Pleasure and the love of Sway  If this account be true we see the perpetual necessity which is not the case in  Men  that  Women  lye under of  disguising  their  ruling Passion  Now the variety of arts employed to this purpose must needs draw them into infinite contradictions in those  Actions  from whence their general and obvious Character is denominated To verify this observation let the reader examine all the Characters here drawn and try whether with this key he cannot discover that all their Contradictions arise from a desire to hide the  ruling Passion  But this is not the worst The poet afterwards from ℣ to takes notice of another mischief arising from this necessity of hiding their ruling Passions which is that generally the end of each is defeated even there where they are most violently pursued For the necessity of hiding them inducing an habitual dissipation of mind Reason whose office it is to regulate the  ruling Passion  loses all its force and direction and these unhappy victims to their principles tho' with their attention still  fixed  upon them are ever prosecuting the means destructive of their end and thus become ridiculous in youth and miserable in old age  Let me not omit to observe the great beauty of the conclusion It is an Encomium on the Lady to whom the Epistle is addressed and artfully turns upon the fact which makes the subject of the Epistle the  contradiction of a Woman's Character  in which contradiction he shews that all the lustre of the best Character consists  And yet believe me good as well as ill  Woman's at best a  Contradiction  still c  VER  How many pictures    The poet's purpose here is to shew that the Characters of Women are generally inconsistent with themselves and this he illustrates by so happy a  Similitude  that we see the folly described in it arises from that very principle which gives birth to this inconsistency of Character  VER c  Arcadia's Countess Pastora by a fountain Leda with a swan Magdalene Cecilia    Attitudes in which several ladies affected to be drawn and sometimes one lady in them all The poet's politeness and complaisance to the sex is observable in this instance amongst others that whereas in the  Characters of Men  he has sometimes made use of real names in the  Characters of Women  always fictious  VER Instances of this position given even from such Characters as are most strongly mark'd and seemingly therefore most consistent As first Contrarieties in the  Affected  ℣ c  VER and II Contrarieties in the  Softnatured  VER III Contrarieties in the  Cunning  and  Artful  VER IV In the  Whimsical  VER V In the  Lewd

teaches that Providence is incessantly turning the evils arising from the follies and vices of men to general good  VER  Cameleons who can paint in white and black    There is one thing that does a very distinguished honour to the accuracy of our poet's judgment of which in the course of these observations I have given many instances and shall here explain in what it consists it is this that the  Similitudes  in his didactic poems of which he is not sparing and which are highly poetical are always chosen with such exquisite discernment of Nature as not only to illustrate the particular point he is upon but to establish the general principles he would inforce so in the instance before us he compares the inconstancy and contradiction in the Characters of Women to the change of colours in the Chameleon yet 'tis nevertheless the great principle of this poem to shew that the general Characteristic of the Sex as to the Ruling Passion which they all have is more uniform than that in Man Now for this purpose all Nature could not have supplied such another illustration as this of the Chameleon for tho' it instantaneously assumes much of the colour of every subject on which it chances to be placed yet as the most accurate  Virtuosi  have observed it has two native colours of its own which amidst all these charges are never totally discharged but tho' often discoloured by the neighbourhood of adventitious ones still make the foundation and give a tincture to all those which from thence it occasionally assumes  VER  Yet Cloe sure c    The purpose of the poet in this Character is important It is to shew that the politic or prudent government of the passions is not enough to make a Character amiable nor even to secure it from being ridiculous if the end of that government be not pursued which is the free exercise of the social appetites after the selfish ones have been subdued For that if tho' reason govern the heart be never consulted we interest ourselves as little in the fortune of such a Character as in any of the foregoing which passions or caprice drive up and down at random  VER  One certain Portrait the same for ever    This is intirely ironical

Constant at Church and Change his gains were sure  His givings rare save farthings to the poor  The Dev'l was piqu'd such saintship to behold  And long'd to tempt him like good Job of old  But Satan now is wiser than of yore  And tempts by making rich not making poor  Rouz'd by the Prince of Air the whirlwinds sweep  The surge and plunge his Father in the deep  Then full against his Cornish lands they roar  And two rich shipwrecks bless the lucky shore  Sir Balaam now he lives like other folks  He takes his chirping pint and cracks his jokes  " Live like yourself" was soon my Lady's word  And lo two puddings smoak'd upon the board  Asleep and naked as an Indian lay  An honest factor stole a Gem away  He pledg'd it to the knight the knight had wit  So kept the Diamond and the rogue was bit  Some scruple rose but thus he eas'd his thought  " I'll now give sixpence where I gave a groat  " Where once I went to church I'll now go twice  " And am so clear too of all other vice"  The Tempter saw his time the work he ply'd  Stocks and Subscriptions pour on ev'ry side  'Till all the Daemon makes his full descent  In one abundant show'r of Cent per Cent  Sinks deep within him and possesses whole  Then dubs Director and fecures his soul  Behold Sir Balaam now a man of spirit  Ascribes his gettings to his parts and merit  What late he call'd a Blessing now was Wit  And God's good Providence a lucky Hit  Things change their titles as our manners turn  His Comptinghouse employ'd the Sundaymorn  Seldom at Church 'twas such a busy life  But duly sent his family and wife  There so

please the fair  The wellbred cuckolds in St James's air  First for his Son a gay Commission buys  Who drinks whores fights and in a duel dies  His daughter flaunts a Viscount's tawdry wife  She bears a Coronet and P  x for life  In Britain's Senate he a seat obtains  And one more Pensioner St Stephen gains  My Lady falls to play so bad her chance  He must repair it takes a bribe from France  The House impeach him Coningsby harangues  The Court forsake him and Sir Balaam hangs  Wife son and daughter Satan are thy own  His wealth yet dearer forfeit to the Crown  The Devil and the King divide the prize  And sad Sir Balaam curses God and dies  COMMENTARY  VER  Who shall decide c    The address of the  Introduction  from ℣ to is remarkable The poet representshimself and the noble Lord his friend as in a conversation philosophising on the  final cause  of  Riches  You  says our author  hold the word from Jove to Momus giv'n  But I who think more highly of our kind c  Opine that Nature c  As much as to say  "You my Lord hold the subject we are upon as fit only for  Satyr  I on the contrary esteem it a case of Philosophy and profound  Ethics  But as we both agree in the main  Principle  that  Riches were not given for the reward of Virtue    but for very different purposes  See  Essay on Man  Ep IV let us  compromise the matter and consider the subject jointly both under your idea and mine  i e Satyrically  and  Philosophically  "  And this in fact we shall find to be the true character of this poem which is a  Species  peculiar to itself and partaking equally of the nature of his  Ethic Epistles  and his  Satyrs  as the best pieces of  Lucian  arose from a combination of the Dialogues of  Plato  and the Scenes of  Aristophanes  This it will be necessary to carry with us if we would see either the  Wit  or the  Reasoning  of this Epistle in their true light  VER  What Nature wants c    Having thus settled the terms of the  Debate  before he comes to the  main Question  the  Use of Riches  it was necessary to discuss a  previous  one whether indeed they are upon the whole  useful to mankind or not  which he does from ℣ to It is commonly observed says he from ℣ to  That Gold most commodiously supplies the wants of Nature  "Let us first consider the proposition in  general  both in  Matter  and  Expression  As it regards the  Supply  and this we shall find to be very  unequal  As it regards the  Wants  and these we shall see are very  ambiguous  under that term all our fantastic and imaginary as well as real wants being comprized Hitherto the use is not very apparent Let us in the second place therefore consider the proposition in  particular  or how Gold supplies the  wants of Nature  both in private and public life As to  private    it aids us indeed to support life but it at the same times hires the assassin As to  Society  it may procure Friendships and extend Trade but it allures Robbers and corrupts our acquaintance As to  Government  it pays the Guards necessary for the support of public liberty but it may with the same ease bribe a Senate to overturn it"  The matter therefore being thus problematical the poet instead of formally balancing between the  Good  and  Ill  chuses to leave this  previous Question undetermined  as  Tacitus  had done before him where speaking of the ancient  Germans  he says  Argentum et aurum propitii aut irati Dii negaverint dubito  and falls at once upon what he esteems the  principal  of these abuses  public Corruption  For having in the last instance of the  Use of Riches  in Government spoken of  venal Senates  he goes on to lament the mischief as desperate and remediless  Gold  by its power to corrupt with  Secrecy  defeating all the efforts of public Spirit whether exerted in the Courage of Heroes or in the Wisdom of Patriots  'Tis true indeed continues the poet from ℣ to the very weight of the Bribery has sometimes detected the Corruption  From the crack'd bag the dropping Guinea  spoke  c  But this inconvenience was soon repaired by the invention of  Paper credit  Whose dreadful effects on public Liberty he describes in all the colouring of his poetry heightened by the warmest concern for virtue which now makes him willing to give up as it were the  previous question  in a passionate wish from ℣ to for the return of that incumbrance attendant on public Corruption before the so  common  use of money  And pleased with this flattering Idea he goes on from ℣ to to shew the other advantages that would accrue from  Riches only in kind  which are that neither  Avarice  could contrive to hoard nor  Prodigality  to lavish in so mad and boundless a manner as they do at present Here he shews particularly in a fine ironical description of the embarras on  Gaming  how effectually it would eradicate that execrable practice  But this whole  Digression  from ℣ to has another very uncommon beauty  for at the same time that it arises naturally from the  last  consideration in the debate of the  previous Question  it artfully denounces in our entrance on the  main Question  the principal topics intended to be employed for the dilucidation of it namely AVARICE PROFUSION and PUBLIC CORRUPTION  VER  Since then my Lord on such a World c    Having thus ironically described the incumbrance which the want of money would occasion to all criminal excesses in the use of Riches particularly to  Gaming  which being now become of public concern he affects much regard to  Oh filthy check to all industrious skill  To spoil the Nation's last great trade Quadrille  he concludes the  previous Question  without deciding it in the same  ironical  manner  Since then my Lord on such a World we fall  What say you Say Why take it Gold and all  That is since for these great purposes we must have  Money  let us now  seriously  inquire into its  true Use  VER  What Riches give us c    He examines therefore in the  first  place from ℣ to I  Of what Use Riches are to ourselves  What Riches give us let us then enquire  Meat Fire and Cloaths What more Meat Cloaths and Fire  The mere  turn  of the expression here shews without further reasoning that all the infinite ways of spending  on ourselves  contrived in the insolence of Wealth by those who would  more than live  are only these  three  things diversified throughout every wearied mode of Luxury and Wantonness  Yet as little as this is adds the poet from ℣ to it is only to be had by the  moderate use  of Riches  Avarice  and  Profusion  not allowing the possessors of the most exorbitant wealth even this little  Alas 'tis more than  Turner  finds they give  Alas 'tis more than all his visions past  Unhappy  Wharton  waking found at last  But what is it you would expect them to give continues the poet from ℣ to Would you have them capable of  restoring  those  real  blessings which men have  lost  by their  Vices  or their  Villanies  or of  satisfying  those  imaginary  ones which they have  gotten  by their  irregular Appetites  and  Passions    these  sure the bad or foolish man cannot  have the face to demand and  those  by the wise provision of Nature Riches are incapable of giving if he had  But now admit pursues our author from ℣ to that wealth might in some cases alleviate the unmerited miseries of life by procuring medicines both for the mind and body yet it is not to be thought it should operate like a charm while only worn about one Yet this these  poor men of pelf  expect from it while  Avarice  on the one hand witholds them from giving at all even to the  Doctor  in extremity or  Vanity  diverts the donation from a  Friend  in life to the Endowment of a  Cat  or  College  at their death It is true  Riches  might give the greatest of all blessings a  virtuous consciousness  of our having employ'd them as became the  substitutes of Providence    To ease or emulate the care of Heav'n  ℣  in acts of BENEFICENCE and CHARITY and this  Use  is next to be considered  VER  To some indeed c    For now the poet comes in the Second place to examine II  Of what use Riches are to others  which he teaches as is his way throughout this poem by the  abuse  that stands opposed to it Thus he shews from ℣ to that with regard to acts of  Beneficence  the utmost Heaven will grant to those who so greatly abuse its blessings is either to enrich some favourite  Bastard  and so perpetuate their vice and infamy or else contrary to their intent a legitimate  Son they hated  and so expose to public scorn and ridicule the defeat of their unnatural cruelty But with regard to acts of  Charity  they are given up to so reprobate a sense as to believe they are then seconding the designs of Heaven when they pursue the indigent with imprecations or leave them in the midst of their distresses unrelieved as the common enemies of God and Man  VER  Yet to be just c    Having thus shewn the  true use  of Riches in a description of the  abuse  and how that use is perpetually defeated by  Profusion  and  Avarice  it was natural to enquire into the spring and original of these vices as the  abuse  they occasion must be well understood before it can be corrected The disposition therefore of his subject now calls upon him to come to the  Philosophy  of it And he examines particularly into the  Motives  of  Avarice  But what is very observable he all along satyrically intermixes with the  real motives  several  imaginary  and those as wild as imagination could conceive This which at first sight might seem to vitiate the purpose of his  philosophical inquiry  is found when duly considered to have the highest art of design His business the reader sees was to prove that the  real motives  had the highest extravagancy Nothing could more conduce to this end than the setting them by and comparing them with the most extravagant that the fancy itself could invent in which situation it was seen that the  real  were full as wild as the  fictitious  To give these images all the force they were capable of he first describes from ℣ to the  real  and a different  imaginary  motive in  the  same person  and then from ℣ to an  imaginary  one and a  real  the very same with the imaginary in  different persons  This address the poet himself alludes to ℣  Less mad the wildest whimsy we can frame c  Let me observe that this has still a further beauty arising from the  nature  of the poem which as we have shewn is partly  satyrical  and partly  philosophical  With regard to the  particular  beauties of this disposition I shall only take notice of one where the poet introduces the  fictitious  motive of Blunt's avarice by a wizard's prophecy  At length Corruption like a gen'ral flood  So long by watchful ministers withstood  Shall deluge all and  Av'rice  creeping on  Spread like a lowborn mist and blot the Sun c  See Britain sunk in lucre's sordid charms  And France reveng'd on Anne and Edward's arms  For it was the poet's purpose in this poem to shew that the  main  and  principal abuse  of Riches arises from AVARICE  VER  All this is madness c    But now the  Sage  who has confined himself to  books  which prescribe the  government of the passions  and never looked out upon the world where he might see them let loose and like Milton's devils  riding the air in whirlwind  cries out  all this is madness  True replies the poet from ℣ to but this madness is a common one and only to be prevented by a severe attention to the rule laid down in the  Essay    Reason still use to Reason still attend  Ep ii ℣  for with the generality of men and without the greatest circumspection  The  ruling Passion  be it what it will  The  ruling Passion  conquers Reason still  But then continues he as wild as this passion appears by the sway of its overbearing bias it would be still more senseless had it no bias at all You have seen us here intermix with the  real  the most  fantastical  and extravagant that imagination could form yet even these are less extravagant than a  ruling Passion without a constant aim  Would you know the reason then listen to this important truth  "'Tis HEAVEN itself that gives the  ruling Passion  and thereby directs different men to different ends But these being exerted thro' the ministry of NATURE of whom the great  Bacon  truly observes  modum tenere nescia est  Aug Scient l ii c they are very apt to run into extremes To correct which Heaven at the same time added the moderatrix  Reason  not to take the  ruling Passion  out of the hands and ministry of  Nature  but to restrain and rectify its irregular impulses See  Essay  Ep ii ℣  seq  and what extremes after this remained uncorrected in the administration of  this  weak Queen  ℣ Ep ii The divine artist himself has in his heavenly skill and bounty set to rights by so ordering that these of the  moral  like those of the  natural  world should even by the very means of their contrariety and diversity concur to defeat the malignity of one another  Extremes in  Nature  equal good produce  Extremes in  Man  concur to gen'ral use  "For as the various seasons of the year are supported and sustained by the reconciled extremes of  Wet  and  Dry    Cold  and  Heat  so all the  orders  and  degrees  of civil life are kept up by  Avarice  and  Profusion    Selfishness  and  Vanity  The Miser being but the Steward of the Prodigal and only so much the more backward as the other is violent and precipitate"  This year a Reservoir to keep and spare  The next a Fountain spouting thro' his heir  VER  Old Cotta sham'd his fortune c    The poet now proceeds to support the principles of his Philosophy by  examples  But before we come to these it will be necessary to look back upon the general ceconomy of the poem  In the first part to ℣ the  use  and  abuse  of Riches are  satyrically  delivered in  precept  From thence to ℣ the causes of the abuse are  philosophically  inquired into And from thence to the end the  use  and  abuse  are  historically  illustrated in  examples  Where we may observe that the conclusion of the  first  part concerning the Miser's cruelty to others naturally introduces the  second  by a satyrical apology shewing that he is full as cruel to himself The explanation of which extraordinary phenomenon brings the author into the  Philosophy  of his subject and this ending in an observation of Avarice and Profusion's correcting and reconciling one another as naturally introduces the  third  which proves the truth of the observation from  fact  And thus the  Philosophy  of his  subject  standing between his  Precepts  and  Examples  gives strength and light to both and receives it reflected back again from both  He first gives us two examples from ℣ to of these opposite  ruling Passions  and to see them in their full force taken from  subjects  as he tells us  not void of wit or worth  from such as could  reason  themselves as we see by ℣  seqq  and ℣  seqq  into the whole length of each extreme For the poet had observed of the  ruling Passion  that  Wit Spirit Faculties but make it worse  Reason itself but gives it edge and pow'r  Essay Ep ii ℣  Old  Cotta  therefore and his  Son  afforded him the most happy illustration of his own doctrine  VER  The Sense to value Riches c    Having now largely exposed the ABUSE of Riches by  example  not only the  Plan  but the  Philosophy  of his  Poem  required that he should in the same way shew the USE likewise He therefore calls for an example in which may be found against the  Prodigal  the  Sense to value  Riches  against the  Vain  the  Art to enjoy them  and against the  Avaricious  the  Virtue to impart them  when acquired This whole Art he tells us may be comprized in one great and general precept which is this  "That the rich man should consider himself as the substitute of Providence in this unequal distribution of things as the person who is  To ease or emulate the care of Heav'n  To  mend  the faults of fortune or to  justify  her graces"  And thus the poet slides naturally into the prosecution of his subject in an  Example  of the  true Use  of Riches  VER  But all our praises why should Lords engross  Rise honest Muse    This invidious expression of the poet's unwillingness that the Nobility should ingross all his praises is strongly ironical their example having been given hitherto only to shew the  abuse  of Riches But there is great justness of  Design  as well as agreeableness of  Manner  in the preference here given to the  Man of Ross  The purpose of the poet is to shew that an  immense  fortune is not wanted for all the good that Riches are capable of doing he therefore chuses such an instance as proves that a man with five hundred pounds a year could become a blessing to a whole country and consequently that the poet's precepts for the  true use of money  are of more  general  service than a bad heart will give an indifferent head leave to conceive This was a truth of the greatest importance to inculcate He therefore from ℣ to exalts the character of a  very private  man one Mr J Kyrle of Herefordshire And in ending his description struck as it were with admiration at a sublimity of his own creating and warmed with sentiments of a Gratitude he had raised in himself in behalf of the public the poet bursts out  And what no monument inscription stone  His race his form his name almost unknown  Then transported with indignation at a contrary object he exclaims  When Hopkins dies a thousand lights attend  The wretch who living sav'd a candle's end  Should'ring God's altar a vile image stands  Belies his features nay extends his hands  I take notice of this description of the portentous vanity of a miserable extortioner chiefly for the use we shall now see he makes of it in carrying on his subject  VER  Behold what blessings Wealth to life can lend  Now see what comfort it affords our end    In the  first  part of this Epistle the author had shewn from  Reason  that Riches abused afford no comfort either in  life  or  death  In  this  part where the same truth is taught by  examples  he had in the case of  Cotta  and his son shewn that they afford no comfort in  life  the other member of the division remained to be spoken to  Now see what Comfort they afford our  end  And this he illustrates from ℣ to in describing the unhappy deaths of the last Villers Duke of Buckingham and Sir J Cutler whose profusion and avarice he has beautifully contrasted The miserable end of these two extraordinary persons naturally leads the poet into this humane reflexion however ludicrously expressed  Say for such worth are other worlds prepar'd  Or are they both in this their own reward  And now as if fully determined to resolve this doubtful question he assumes the air  and importance of a Professor ready address'd to plunge himself into the very depths of theology  A knotty point to which we now proceed  when on a sudden the whole scene is changed  But you are tir'd I'll tell a tale agreed  And thus by the most easy transition we are come to the  concluding doctrine  of his poem  VER  Where London's column c    For the foregoing examples of prosusion and avarice having been given to shew that misapplied wealth was  not enjoyed  it only remained to prove that in such circumstances wealth became the  heaviest punishment  and this was the very point to be concluded with as the great MORAL of this instructive poem which is to teach us  how miserable men make themselves by not endeavouring to restrain the ruling Passion    tho' it be indeed implanted in the constitution of things  while at the same time it is an answer to the latter part of the question  Say for such worth are other world's prepar'd  Or are they both in this their own reward  For the solution of which only this example was jocularly pretended to have been given  All this the poet has admirably supported in the artful construction of his fable of Sir Balaam whose character is so drawn as to let the reader see he had it in his power to regulate the  ruling Passion  by reason as having in himself the seeds of Integrity Religion and Sobriety These are gradually worked out by an insatiable  thirst of Wealth  and this again thro' a false sense of his own abilities in acquiring it succeeded by as immoderate a  Vanity  Let me only observe farther that the author in this  Tale  has artfully summed up and recapitulated those three principal mischiefs in the  abuse  of money which the  satyrical  part of this poem throughout was employed to expose namely AVARICE PROFUSION and PUBLIC CORRUPTION  NOTES  VER  Opine    A word sacred to controversy and high debate  VER JOHN WARD of Hackney Esq

admirable picture of human nature In the entrance on life all but coxcombs born are usually modest and esteem the favours of their superiors as marks of their benevolence But if these favours happen to increase instead of advancing in gratitude to our benefactors we only improve in the good opinion of ourselves and the constant returns of them make us consider them no longer as accommodations to our wants or obligations for our service but debts due to our merit Yet at the same time to do justice to our nature let us observe that this does not proceed so often from downright vice as is imagined when it does the vice is bad indeed but frequently from mere infirmity and then too the reason is evident for having small knowledge of and yet excessive fondness for ourselves we estimate our merit by the opinion of others and this perhaps would not be much amiss were we not apt to take their favours for a declaration of their opinion How many for instance do we see in every faculty of

treated of in the foregoing Epistle this takes up one particular branch of the latter the  Vanity of Expence  in people of Wealth and Quality and is therefore a corollary to the preceding It is equally remarkable for exactness of method with the rest But the nature of the subject which is less philosophical makes it capable of being analysed in a much narrower compass  VER  'Tis strange c    The poet's introduction from ℣ to consists of a very curious  remark  arising from his intimate knowledge of nature together with an  illustration  of it taken from his observations on life It is this that the Prodigal no more  enjoys  his Profusion than the Miser his Rapacity It was generally thought that  Avarice  only  kept  without enjoyment but the poet here first acquaints us with a circumstance in human life much more to be lamented viz that  Profusion  too can  communicate  without it whereas  Enjoyment  was thought to be as peculiarly the reward of the  beneficent  passions of which this seems to have the appearance as  want  of enjoyment was the punishment of the  selfish  The phaenomenon observed is odd enough But if we look more narrowly into this matter we shall find that Prodigality when in pursuit of  Taste  is only a  Mode of Vanity  and consequently as selfish a passion as even Avarice itself and it is of the ordonance and constitution of all selfish passions when growing to excess to defeat their own end which is  Selfenjoyment  But besides the accurate philosophy of this observation there is a fine  Morality  contained in it namely that  illgot  Wealth is not only as unreasonably but as  uncomfortably  squandered as it was raked together which the poet himself further insinuates in ℣  What brought Sir Visto's  illgot wealth  to waste  He then illustrates this observation by divers examples in every branch of  wrong Taste  and to set their absurdities in the strongest light he in conclusion contrasts them  with several instances of the  true  in the noble Lord to whom the Epistle is addressed This disposition is productive of various beauties for by this means the  Introduction  becomes an  epitome  of the body of the Epistle which as we shall see consists of general reflections on  Taste  and particular examples of  bad  and  good  And his friend's Example concluding the Introduction leads the poet gracefully into the subject itself for this Lord here celebrated for his good Taste was now at hand to deliver the first and fundamental percept of it himself which gives authority and dignity to all that follow  VER  Oft have you hinted to your brother Peer  A certain truth    and in this artful manner begins the body of the Epistle  I  The first part of it from ℣ to delivers rules for attaining to the MAGNIFICENT in just expence which is the same in Building and Planting that the SUBLIME is in Painting and Poetry and consequently the qualities necessary for the attainment of both must have the same relation  The first and  fundamental  he shews from ℣ to to be SENSE  Good Sense  which only is the gift of Heav'n  And tho' no Science fairly worth the Seven  And for  that  reason not only as it is the foundation and parent of them all and the constant regulator and director of their operations or as the poet better expresses it  of every Art the Soul  but likewise as it alone can in case of need very often supply the offices of every one of them  VER  To build to plant c    The next quality for dignity and use is TASTE and but the next For as the poet truly observes there is  something previous ev'n to Taste 'tis Sense  and this in the order of things For  Sense  is a taste and true conception of  Nature  and  Taste  is a sense or true conception of  beautiful Nature  but we must first know the  Essences  of things before we can judge truly of their  Qualities  The business of  Taste  therefore in the pursuit of  Magnificence  is as the poet shews us from ℣ to to ℣ to catch or lay hold on  Nature  where she appears most in her charms to ℣ To adorn her when taken as best suits her dignity and quality that is to dress her in the light and modest habit of a virgin not load her with the gaudy ornaments of a prostitute This rule observed will prevent a transgression in the following which is not to let all its beauties be seen at once but in succession for that advantage is inseparable from a graceful and welldressed person to ℣ To take care that the ornaments be well suited to  that part  which it is your purpose to adorn and as in dressing out a  modest Fair  which is the poet's own comparision the colours are proportioned to her complexion the stuff to the embonpoint of her person and the fashion to her air and shape so in ornamenting a villa  the rise or fall of waters  should correspond to its acclivities or declivities the  artificial hills or vales  to its cover or exposure and the manner of  calling in the country  to the disposition of its aspect But again as in the illustration whatever be the variety in colour stuff or fashion they must still be so suited with respect to one another as to produce an agreement and harmony in their assemblage so woods waters mountains vales and vistas must amidst all their diversity be so disposed with a relation to each other as to create a perfect symmetry resulting  from the whole and this the  Genius  of the place when religiously consulted will never fail to inform us of who as the poet says  Now breaks and now directs th' intending lines  Paints as you plant and as you work designs  And this is a full and complete description of the  office of Taste  VER  Still follow Sense c    But now when  good Sense  has led us up to  Taste  our fondness for the elegances of our new mistress oftentimes occasions us to neglect the plainness and simplicity of the old we are but too apt to forsake our Guide and to give ourselves up solely to  Taste  Our author's next rule therefore is  still to follow Sense  and let it perpetually accompany us thro' all the works of  Taste  Still follow Sense of ev'ry art the  Soul  That is  Good Sense  should never be a moment absent from the works of  Taste  any more than the Soul from the Body for just as the Soul animates and informs every air and feature of a beauteous body so  Sense  gives life and vigour to all the products of  Taste  VER  Parts answ'ring parts c    The particular advantages of the union of  Sense with Taste he then explains from this verse to That the beautiful parts which  Taste  has laid out and contrived  Sense  makes to answer one another and to  slide  naturally without violence  into a whole  That many beauties will  spontaneously offer  themselves suggested from the very necessity which  Sense  lays upon us of conforming the parts to the whole that no original invention of  Taste  would have supplied A third advantage is that you are then always sure to have  Nature on your side    Nature shall join you  The expression is important  Sense  being a right conception of  Nature  and  Taste  a right conception of  beautiful Nature  when these are in conjunction Nature can stand out no longer but presents herself to you without further pains or search  VER  Without it proud Versailles c    To illustrate this doctrine the poet next shews us from ℣ to that without this continued support of  Good Sense  things even of the  highest Taste  and  utmost Magnificence  such as the Buildings of  Versailles  the Gardens of  Villario  and the Groves of  Sabinus  which are the instances he gives all in a very little time come to nothing And no wonder For the exercise of  Taste  WITHOUT SENSE is where something that is  not beautiful Nature  is  mistaken for it and  ornamented  as beautiful Nature should be These ornaments there fore being destitute of all real support must be continually subject to change Sometimes the owner himself will grow weary of them as in the case of  Villario  and find at last that  Nature  is to be preferred before them  Tir'd of the scene  Parterres  and  Fountains  yield  He finds at last he better likes a  Field  Sometimes again the Heir like  Sabinus  's will be changing a bad Taste for a worse  One  boundless green  or  flourish'd carpet  views  With all the  mournful family  of yews  So that  mere Taste  standing exposed between the true and  false  like the decent man between the rigidly virtuous and thoroughly profligate hated and despised by both can never long support itself and with this the  first part  of the Epistle concludes  II  VER  At Timon's Villa c    As the first part ended with exposing the works of  Taste without Sense  the second begins with a description from ℣ to of  false Magnificence  WITHOUT EITHER SENSE OR TASTE in the gardens buildings  tablefurniture library and way of living of Lord  Timon  who in none of these could distinguish between  greatness  and  vastness  between  regularity  and  form  between  dignity  and  fastus  or between  learning  and  pedantry  But what then says the poet here resuming the great  principle of his Philosophy  which these moral Epistles were wrote to illustrate and consequently on which they are all regulated tho'  Heav'n visits with a Taste the wealthy Fool  And needs no  Rod  Yet the punishment is confined as it ought and the evil is turned to the benefit of  others  For  hence the poor are cloath'd the hungry fed  Health to himself and to his infants bread  The lab'rer bears what his  hard heart  denies  His  charitable vanity  supplies  VER  Another age c    But now a difficulty sticks with me answers an objector this load of evil still remains a monument of folly to future ages an incumbrance to the plain on which it stands and a nuisance to the neigbourhood around as filling it  with imitating fools  For men are apt to take the example next at hand and aptest of all to take a bad one No fear of that replies the poet from ℣ to Nothing absurd or wrong is exempt from the jurisdiction of Time which is always sure to do full justice on it  Another age shall see the golden Ear  Imbrown the Slope and nod on the Parterre  Deep Harvests bury all his pride has plan'd  And laughing Ceres reassume the land  For the prerogative of  Time shall make it grow  is only due to the designs of  true Taste  joined to  Use  And  'Tis  Use  alone that  sanctifies  Expence  and nothing but the sanctity of  that  can arrest the justice of Time And thus the second part concludes which consisting of an  example of false  Taste in every attempt to Magnificence is full of concealed  precepts  for the  true  As the first part which contains  precepts  for  true  Taste is full of  examples  of the  false  III  VER  Who then shall grace c    We come now to the third and last part from ℣ to the end and as in the first the poet had given examples of wrongjudged  Magnificence  in things of  Taste without Sense  and in the second an example of others  without either Sense or Taste  so the third is employed in two illustrious examples of  Magnificence  in  Planting and Building  where  both Sense and Taste  highly prevail The one in him to whom this Epistle is addressed and the other in the Noble person whose excellent Character bore so conspicuous a part in the foregoing  Who then shall grace or who improve the Soil  Who plants like  BATHURST  or who builds like  BOYLE  Where in the fine description he gives of these two species of  Magnificence  he artfully  insinuates that tho' when executed in a  true Taste  the great end and aim of both be the same viz the  general  good in use or ornament yet that their progress to this end is carried on in direct contrary courses that in  Planting  the private advantage of the neighbourhood is first promoted till by time it rises up to a public benefit  Whose ample Lawns are not asham'd to feed  The milky heifer and deserving steed  Whose rising Forests not for pride or show  But future Buildings future Navies grow  On the contrary the wonders of Architecture ought first to be bestowed on the public  Bid Harbours open public ways extend  Bid Temples worthier of the God ascend  Bid the broad Arch the dang'rous flood contain  The Mole projected break the roaring main  And when the public has been properly strengthened and adorned then and not till  then the works of private  Magnificence  may take place This was the order observ'd by those two great Empires from whom we received all we have of this polite art We read not of any the least Magnificence in the private buildings of Greece or Rome till the grandeur of their public spirit had adorned the State with Temples Emporiums Councilhouses CommonPorticos Baths and Theatres  NOTES  VER  Topham    A Gentleman famous for a judicious collection of Drawings  VER  For Pembroke Statues  dirty Gods  and Coins    The author speaks here not as as a Philosopher or Divine but as a  Connoisseur  and Antiquary consequently the natural attribute here assigned to these Gods of old renown is not in disparagement of their worth but in high commendations of their genuine pretensions  VER  Rare monkish Manuscripts for Hearne alone    This is not to be understood in the strictness of the letter as if Mr Tho Hearne enjoyed these rarities without a partaker for he has been often known to exemplify these precious zelicks under the authority of the Clarendon Printinghouse where the good seed has sometimes produced forty or fifty folds Hence and from their still continuing as much rarities as ever it may be reasonably concluded they were not the delight of Mr T Hearne alone  VER  And Books for Mead and Rarities for Sloane    Two eminent Physicians the one had an excellent Library the other the finest collection in Europe of natural curiosities both men of great learning and humanity  VER  Than his fine Wise alas or finer Whore    By the author's manner of putting together these two different utensils of  false Magnificence  it appears that properly speaking neither the  Wise  nor the  Whore  is the real object of  modern taste  but the  Finery  only And whoever  wears it whether the Wife or Whore it matters not any further than that the  latter  best deserves it as appears from her having most of it and so indeed becomes by accident the more fashionable thing of the two  VER  Heav'n visits with a Taste the wealthy fool    The present rage of  Taste  amidst the excess and overflow of general Luxury may be very properly represented by a  desolating pestilence  alluded to in the word  Visit  where  Taste  becomes as the poet says  a planetary Plague when Jove  Will o'er some highvic'd City hang his poison  In the sick air  VER  Ripley    This man was a carpenter employ'd by a first Minister who rais'd him to an Architect without any genius in the art and after some wretched proofs of his insufficiency in public Buildings made him Comptroller of the Board of works  VER  See sportive fate to punish awkward pride    Pride is one of the greatest mischiefs as well as absurdities of our nature and therefore as appears both from profane and sacred History has ever been the more peculiar object of divine vengeance But  awkward Pride  intimates such abilities in its owner as eases us of the apprehension of much  mischief  from it so that the poet supposes such a one secure from the serious resentment of Heaven though it may permit fate or fortune to bring him into the public contempt and ridicule which his native badness of heart so well deserves  VER The Earl of Burlington was then publishing the Designs of Inigo Jones and the Antiquities of Rome by Palladio  VER  And of one beauty many blunders make    Because the road to  Taste  like that to Truth is but  one  and those to Error and Absurdity a  thousand  VER  Load some vain Church with old Theatric state    In which there is a complication of absurdities arising both from their different  natures and forms  For the one being for  holy service  and the other only for  civil amusement  it is impossible that the profuse and lascivious ornaments of the latter should become the reverence retinue and sanctity of the other Nor will any examples of this vanity of ornament in the sacred buildings of antiquity justify this imitation for those ornaments might be very suitable to a Temple of Bacchus or Venus which would ill become the sobriety and purity of the present Religion  Again we should consider that the usual form of a Theatre would only permit the architectonic ornaments to be placed on the outward face whereas those of a  Church  may be as commodiously and are more properly put within particularly in great and close pentup Cities where the incessant driving of the smoak in a little time corrodes and destroys all outward ornaments of this kind especially if the members as is the common taste be small and little  VER  Turn Arcs of triumph to a Gardengate    This absurdity seems to have arisen from an injudicious imitation of what these Builders might have heard of at the entrance of the antient Gardens of Rome But they don't consider that those were  public Gardens  given to the people by some great man after a triumph to which therefore  Arcs  of this kind were very suitable ornaments  VER  Then clap four slices c    This is a very good and easy  Receipt  to make a  Front  and may be worth recommending to the Builders aforesaid who can do nothing of their own invention better nor by many degrees so cheap which too may deserve the consideration of those who set them on work  VER  Proud to catch cold at a Venetian door    In the foregoing instances the poet exposes the absurd imitation of foreign and discordant  Manners  in  public  buildings here he turns to the still greater absurdities of taking their models from a discordant  Climate  in their  private  which folly he supposes they will sooner be made sensible of as they  must feel for themselves  tho' they  will not see for the public  VER  Oft have you hinted c  Something there is more needful than Expence    To convince a great man of so strange a Paradox that  Taste  cannot be bought even after it is paid for will need a very broad  hint  indeed especially when followed by another as strange that there is  something previous ev'n to  Taste  tis  Sense  Yet as severe a subject of humiliation as  all this is to the  Rich  it was but necessary to inculcate it in order to work in them if possible that teachableness of mind necessary for their profiting by the following instructions  VER  Inigo Jones  the celebrated Architect and M  Le Nôtre  the designer of the best Gardens of France  VER  Let not each beauty ev'ry where be spy'd    For when the same beauty obtrudes itself upon you over and over when it meets you full at whatever place you stop or to whatever point you turn then Nature loses her proper charms of a  modest fair  and you begin to hate and nauseate her as a prostitute  VER  Where half the skill is decently to hide    If the poet was right in comparing the true dress of  Nature  to that of a  modest fair  it is a plain consequence that one half of the designer's art must be  decently to hide  as the other half is  gracefully to discover  VER  Consult the Genius of the Place c  to  designs  ℣  The personalizing or rather  deifying the Genius of the place  in order to be consulted as an Oracle has produced one of the noblest and most sublime descriptions of  Design  that poetry could express Where this  Genius  while presiding over the work is represented by little and little as advancing from a simple  adviser  to a  creator  of all the beauties of improved Nature in a  variety  of bold metaphors and allusions all rising one above another till they complete the  unity  of the general idea  First the  Genius  of the place  tells the waters  or only simply gives directions Then he  helps th' ambitious hill  or is a fellowlabourer Then again he  scoops the  circling Theatre  or works alone or in chief Afterwards rising fast in our idea of dignity he  calls in the country  alluding to the orders of princes in their progress when accustomed to display all their state and magnificence His character then grows sacred he  joins willing woods  a metaphor taken from the office of the priesthood in the administration of one of its holy rites till at length he becomes a Divinity and creates and presides over the whole  Now breaks or now directs th' intending lines  Paints as you plant and as you work designs  Much in the same manner as the  plastic Nature  is supposed to do in the work of human generation  VER  Still follow Sense c    The not observing this rule bewilder'd a late noble writer distinguished for his  philosophy of Taste  in the pursuit of the grand and  magnificent  in  moral life  who when  Good Sense  had led him up to the  of ancient renown discharged his Guide and captivated with the delights of  Taste  resolved all into the  elegancies of that idea And now Reason Morality Religion and the truth of things were nothing else but TASTE which that he might not be thought altogether to have deserted his sage conductress he sometimes dignified with the name of  moral sense  And he succeeded in the pursuit of Truth accordingly  VER  Parts answ'ring parts shall slide into a whole    i e  shall not be  forced  but  go of themselves  as if both the parts and whole were not of  yours  but of  Nature's  making The metaphor is taken from a piece of mechanism finish'd by some great master where all the parts are so previously fitted as to be easily put together by any ordinary workman and each part  slides  into its place as it were thro' a groove ready made for that purpose  VER The seat and gardens of the Lord Viscount Cobham in Buckinghamshire  VER  And Nero's Terraces desert  their walls    The expression is very significant Had the  Walls  been said to  desert  the  Terraces  this would have given us the image of a destruction affected by time only which had been foreign to the poet's intention who is here speaking of the punishment of  unsupported Taste  in the designed subversion of it either by  good  or  bad  as it happens one of which is sure to do its business and that soon therefore it is with great propriety he says that the  Terraces desert their walls  which implies purpose and violence in their subversion  VER  Lo  COBHAM  comes and Soats them with a Lake    An high compliment to the noble person on whom it is bestowed as making him the  substitute of Good Sense  This office in the original plan of the poem was given to another who not having the SENSE to see a compliment was intended him convinced the poet it did not belong to him  VER  Or cut wide views thro' Mountains to the Plain  You'll wish your hill or shelter'd seat again    This was done in Hertfordshire by a wealthy citizen at the expence of above l by which means merely to overlook a dead plain he

duely frequented the Court  VER  The Wood supports the Plain the parts unite  And strength of Shade contends with strength of Light    The imagery is here taken from  Painting  in the judicious execution of the  Pencil  and in the happy improvement of it by  time  To understand what is meant by  supporting  which is a term of art common both to  Planting  and  Painting  we must consider what things make the natural defect or weakness of a rude uncultivated  Plain  and these are the having a disagreable flatness and the not having a  proper termination  But a  Wood  rightly disposed takes away the one and gives what is wanting of the other  The parts unite  The utmost which art can do when it does its full office is to give the work a  consent  of parts but it is  time  only that can make the  union  here spoken of there being the same difference between these as between a simple  Contract  and a  Consummation  So in painting the skill of the  master  can go no further in the chromatic part than to set those colours together which have a natural friendship and sympathy for each other But nothing but  time  can unite and incorporate their tints  And strength of Shade contends with strength of Light  And now the work becomes a  very  picture which the poet informs us of in the sublime way of poetical instruction by setting that picture before our eyes and not merely a picture but a  perfect  one in which the lights and shades not only bear a  proportion  to one another in their force which is implied in the word  contends  but are both at their  height  which the word  strength  signifies As the use of the singular number in the terms  Shade  and  Light  alludes to another precept of the art that not only the shades and lights should be great and broad but that the masses of the clairobscure in a groupe of objects should be so managed by a subordination of the groups to the unity of design as that the whole together may afford one great  shade  and  light  VER  Blushing in bright diversities of day    i e  The several colours of the grove in bloom give several different tints to the lights and shades  VER  Foe to the Dryads of his Father's groves    Finely intimating by this sublime classical image that the Father's taste was  enthusiastical  in which passion there is always something great and noble tho' it be too apt in its flights to

mournful family of Yews  VER The two extremes in parterres which are equally faulty a  boundless Green  large and naked as a field or a  flourish'd Carpet  where the greatness and nobleness of the

fond of Evergreens particularly Yews which are the most tonsile as to destroy the nobler Foresttrees to make way for such little ornaments as Pyramids of darkgreen continually repeated not unlike a Funeral procession  VER  At  Timon's  Villa    This description is intended to comprize the principles of a false Taste of Magnificence and to exemplify what was said before that nothing but Good Sense can attain it  VER  Lo what huge heaps of  littleness around    Grandeur  in building as in the human frame takes not its denomination from the  body  but the  soul  of the work when the soul therefore is lost or incumber'd in its invelope the unanimated parts how  huge  soever are not members of grandeur but mere  heaps of littleness  VER  Grove nods at grove each Alley has a brother  And half the platform just reflects the other    This is exactly the  two puddings  of the citizen in the foregoing fable only served up a little more magnificently But both on the same absurd principle of wrong taste viz that one can never have too much of a good thing  Ibid  Grove nods at grove c    The exquisite humour of this expression arises solely from its significancy These  groves  that have no meaning but very near relation can express themselves only like twin ideots by  nods  which just serve to let us understand that they know one another as being  nursed  up by one common parent  VER The two Statues of the  Gladiator pugnans  and  Gladiator moriens  VER The  Approaches  and  Communications  of house with garden or of one part with another ill judged and inconvenient  VER  His Study c    The false Taste in Books a satyr on the vanity in collecting them more frequent in men of Fortune than the study to understand them Many delight chiefly in the elegance of the print or of the binding some have carried it so far as to cause the upper shelves to be filled with painted books of wood others pique themselves so much upon books in a language they do not understand as to exclude the most useful in one they do  VER The false Taste in  Music  improper to the subjects as of light airs in Churches often practised by the organists  c  VER  That summons you to all the  Pride  of Pray'r    This absurdity is very happily expressed  Pride  of all human sollies being the first we should leave behind us when we approach to the sacred altar But he who could take Meanness for Magnificence might easily mistake  Humility  for  Meanness  VER And in  Painting  from which even Italy is not free of naked figures in Churches  c  which has obliged some Popes to put draperies on some of those of the best masters  VER  Where  sprawl  the Saints of Verrio or Laguerre    The fine image here given in a single word admirably exposes the unnatural position of the picture and the too natural postures of its female figures  Ibid  Verrio or Laguerre    Verrio Antonio painted many cielings c at Windsor Hamptoncourt c and Laguerre at Blenheimcastle and other places  VER  Who never mentions Hell to ears polite    This is a fact a reverend Dean preaching at Court threatened the sinner with punishment in  "a place which he thought it not decent to name in so polite an assembly"  VER Taxes the incongruity of  Ornaments  tho' sometimes practised by the ancients where an open mouth ejects the water into a fountain or where the shocking images of serpents c are introduced in Grottos or Buffets  VER  The rich Buffet  wellcolour'd  Serpents grace    The circumstance of being  wellcolour'd  shews this ornament not only to be very absurd but very  odious  too and has a peculiar beauty as in one instance of false Taste viz  an injudicious choice in imitation  he gives in the epithet employ'd the suggestion of another which is an  injudicious manner of it  For those disagreeable objects which when  painted  give pleasure if  coloured  after nature in  relief  become shocking as a toad or dead carcase in waxwork yet these things are the delight of all people of bad Taste However the Ornament itself pretends to science and would justify its use by antiquity tho' it betrays the most miserable ignorance of it The  Serpent  amongst the ancients was sacred and full of venerable mysteries Now things do not excite ideas so much according to their own natural impressions as by fictitious ones arising from foreign and accidental  combinations consequently the view of this animal raised in them nothing of that abhorrence which it is wont to do in us but on the contrary very agreeable sensations correspondent to those foreign associations Hence and more especially because the Serpent was the peculiar  Symbol of health  it became an extreme proper ornament to the  genial rooms  of the ancients While we who are strangers to all this superstition yet make ourselves liable to one much more absurd which is idolizing the very  fashions  that arose from it But if these pretenders to Taste can so widely mistake it is no wonder that those who pretend to none I mean the verbal Critics should a little  hallucinate  in this matter I remember when the short Latin inscription on Shakespear's monument was first set up and in the very style of elegant and simple antiquity the Newspapers were full of these small Critics in which the only observation that looked like learning was founded in this ignorance of Taste and Antiquity One of these Critics objected to the word  Mors  in the inscription because the Roman writers of the purest times scrupled to employ it but in its stead used an improper that is a figurative word or otherwise a circumlocution But had he consider'd that it was their Superstition of  lucky  and  unlucky words  which occasion'd this delicacy he must have seen that a Christian writer in a Christian inscription acted with great judgment in avoiding so senseless an affectation of what he miscalls classical expression  VER  Is this a dinner c    The proud Festivals of some men are here set forth to ridicule where pride destroys the ease and formal regularity all the pleasurable enjoyment of the entertainment  VER  Sancho's  dread Doctor    See Don Quixote chap xlvii  VER  Yet hence the Poor c    The  Moral  of the whole where PROVIDENCE is justified in giving Wealth to those who squander it in this manner A bad Taste employs more hands and diffuses Expence more than a good one This recurs to what is laid down in Book I Epist ℣ and in the Epistle preceeding this ℣ c  VER  And laughing Ceres reassume the land    The great beauty of this line is merely owing to the  Art  of the poet by which he has so disposed a trite classical figure as not only to make it do it's common office of representing a very  plentiful Harvest  but also to assume the  Image of Nature  reestablishing herself in her rights and  mocking  the vain efforts of false magnificence which would keep her out of them  VER  'Tis  Use  alone that  sanctifies  expence  And Splendor borrows all her rays from Sense    Here the poet to make the  examples  of  good Taste  the better understood introduces them with a summary of his  Precepts  in these two sublime lines for the consulting  Use  is  beginning with Sense  and the making  Splendor  or  Taste borrow all its rays  from thence is  going on with Sense  after she has led us up to  Taste  The art of this can never be sufficiently admired But the Expression is equal to the Thought This  sanctifying  of expence gives us the idea of something consecrated and set apart for sacred uses and indeed it is the idea under which it may be properly considered For wealth employed  according to the  intention  of the great donor is its true consecration and the real uses of humanity were certainly  first  in his  intention  VER  c 'Till Kings Bid Harbors open c    The poet after having touched upon the proper objects of Magnificence and Expence in the private works of great men comes to those great and public works which become a Prince This Poem was published in the year when some of the newbuilt Churches by the Act of Queen Anne were ready to fall being sounded in boggy land which is satyrically alluded to in our author's imitation of Horace lib ii Sat  Shall half the newbuilt Churches round thee fall  others were vilely executed thro' fraudulent cabals between undertakers officers  c  Dagenhambreach had done very great mischiefs many of the Highways throughout England were hardly passable and most of those which were repaired by Turnpikes were made jobs for private lucre and infamously executed even to the entrances of London itself The proposal of building a Bridge at Westminster had been petition'd against and rejected but in two years after the publication of this poem an Act for building a Bridge past thro' both houses After many debates in the committee the execution was left to the carpenter abovementioned who would have made it a wooden one to which our author alludes in these lines  Who builds a Bridge that never drove a pile
