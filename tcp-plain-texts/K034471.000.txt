 CLEONICE PRINCESS of BITHYNIA A TRAGEDY  As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  BY JOHN HOOLE  DUBLIN PRINTED BY W SPOTSWOOD FOR THE UNITED COMPANY OF BOOKSELLERS  MDCCLXXV  PROLOGUE  Written by THOMAS VAUGHAN  Esq  Spoken by Mr BENSLEY  TELL me ye Gods ye arbiters of wit  Who rule the heavens or who lead the pit  addressing the gallery and pit  Whence comes it in an age refin'd by taste  By science polish'd and by judgement chaste  We see the Muse in dignity sublime  Led on by prologue apeing  pantomime  Whose sportive fancy and whose comic skill  All must applaudwhere  Roscius  guides the quill  Yet when  Melpomene  in grief appears  Her suff'ring virtue bath'd in sorrow's tears  From Tyrant laws or jealous love oppress'd  Swelling with silence in her tortur'd breast  How can the heart her genial impulse shew  Feel as she feels or weep another's woe  When gay  Thalia  has so late possess'd  The laughing transports of the human breast  Let each her province keep let jocund mirth  To Epilogue alone give happy birth  Ease the struck soul from ev'ry anxious fcar  And wipe from beauty's check the silent tear  Twice  Metastasio  's wings have borne our Bayes  And safely brought him o'er the critic seas  Fir'd with success he dares this awful night  Cheer'd by your smiles to take a bolder flight  Nor longer stoop beneath a foreign shade  Like Dian shining from a borrow'd aid  But comes impregnate with  Icarian  pride  To stretch his pinnions and forsake his guide  Yet doubtful flies lest vapours damp his force  And one black cloud should stop his airy course  To awful heights his proud ambition soars  And the dread regions of applause explores  No sun he fearsbut courts its warmest ray  'Tis yours to raiseor sink him in the sea  Let  Candour  then proceed to try the cause  That  Magna Charta  of dramatic laws  PROLOGUE  Written by a Friend to have been spoken in the character of the Tragic Muse  Designed for Mrs BARRY  JUDGES of Genius from whose hands a bard  This night awaits the laurel of reward  To you the Tragic Muse in  Britain  's name  Comes to announce the merits of his claim  'Tis I have led him timorous to this field  And bade him dare his country's guantlet wield  Bade him aspire to vault her fiery breed  Nor humbly stoop to mount the manag'd steed  Long had I seen his patient merit toil  In culling chaplets from a foreign soil  Whilst here transplanted by his skilful hand  Italia's honours bloom'd in  Albion  's land  Long had I mark'd as such exotic boughs  Content he wove to veil his modest brows  A spirit that in paths untrod before  Might snatch the nobler foliage of this shore  Pleas'd with the hopes that I had now descry'd  A future son from whom the buskin's pride  To this my favourite Isle again might rise  I touch'd his ear and pointed out the prize  "Wither my honours in this clime I said  "Buds here no bounteous leaf to deck thy head  "Are these once fosiering skies so overcast  "That Genius dares not brave th' inclement blast  "Come let me lead thee where my sons of yore  "In Fancy's fields amass'd their laureate store  "With active powers aloft bestrode the clouds  "Inspir'd by kind acclaims of shouting crowds  "Turn thee where Shakespear wav'd the mystic rod  "And saw a new creation wait his nod  "Behold where Terror with eccentric stride  "Bursts like a torrent from the mountain's side  "Behold where gentle pity heaves the sigh  "Sluicing the fruitful conduit of the eye  "See love at whose approach the airy Wiles  "Of Mirth and Freedom or the jocund Smiles  "Of sweet content dispers'd in wild affright  "Mount on their silken wings and take their flight  "See Jealousy his hideous form uprear  "Tine the quick brand and shake the vengeful spear  "While close behind fell Anguish aud Disdain  "Stalk sullen by and swell his gloomy train  "Mark where Despair points to some distant ground  "On blasted yews where Nightbirds shrick around  "Where yawning Tombs add horror to the night  "And Meteors flash their momentary light  "Here mark thyself what various objects rise  "Nor trust the medium of another's eyes'  I spokeand Genius strait began to spread  His ready Plumage and my voice obey'd  Adventurous thence he dares this night aspire  To stamp the vivid scene with native fire  'Tis yours ye Britons then with kind applause  To fan the flame I kindled in your cause  Nor be it said when on your mercy thrown  You foster every spark but what's your own  From your dread sentence crown'd with laurels won  I ardently expect to greet a Son  The Palm I have deposited with you  And trust your hearts to give it where 'tis due  Dramatis Personae  MEN  ARTABASUS  King of Pontus  Mr BARRY  PHARNACES  his son under the name of Arsetes  Mr

 Bithynia  and the country adjacent  CLEONICE A TRAGEDY  ACT I  SCENE a gallery  TERAMENES AGENOR  TERAMENES  AGENOR still Bithynia must retain  The sword unsheath'd and still remov'd afar  Shall Peace in vain desir'd mock every hope  Of dear domestic happinessthe leagues  Of factious princes whose associate force  Has vex'd this bleeding land now yield indeed  To Lycomedes' arms or rather shrink  Before the genius of your noble friend  Agen  Arsetes bred in distant realms and long  A wanderer o'er the face of earth must hail  The hour that led his steps to tread your soil  And gave him Teramenes for his friend  Tera  Tho' now the rage of civil strife is past  Full well thou know'st tomorrow's sun declin'd  His next returning beam lights up the day  That ends the truce with Pontus and demands  Our strongest force to meet a mightier foe  In Artabasus  Agen  Five returning suns  Have chang'd your vernal groves since as the breath  Of Fame declares your armies met and fought  On Hippias' banks what time your martial powers  Forgive me if report mislead my tongue  Bow'd to a foreign standard  Tera  Lycomedes  Whose thirst of glory in his vigorous life  Compell'd the neighbouring states to bend beneath  Bithynia's yoke when creeping time had clogg'd  The vital springs and kept his age from scenes  Of active valour by his generals still  Maintain'd the field and thro' the nations spread  His martial terrors till that fatal day  When Hippias down his current dy'd with blood  The frequent corse and glittering ensign bore  Then midst the slaughter fell a sacrifice  To iron war our king's lamented son  A youth the early darling of his sire  The soldier's hope and nursling of the field  Agen  Oft have I heard Polemon's name whose brave  Unpractis'd arm encounter'd Artabasus  And from his sword receiv'd a glorious death  Tera  But tho' the time's necessity compell'd  Bithynia to the truce still still the thought  Of his Polemon rankled in the bosom  Of our afflicted monarch still the hope  Tho' distant hope of vengeance glow'd within  And fed eternal hatred in his soul  While now to Pontus' bounds his army spreads  Its conquering legions he forgoes the state  Of Nicomedias' palace to reside  Amidst this city whose opposing bulwarks  Rise on the kingdom's edge and dare the foe  Agen  Fame speaks your rival great and gives the praise  Of might and wisdom to the king of Pontus  And more 'tis said his son amidst the files  Of Rome's immortal legions distant far  From Pontus learns the rugged trade of war  And gathers laurels in his blooming age  That veterans view with envy his return  Gives earnest of new triumphs  Tera  Let him come  Would yet Arsetes aid Bithynia's cause  His sword with brave Orontes join'd whose hand  Must sway the scepter of Bithynia's realm  Might fix th' unsteady wing of victory  To Lycomedes' bands  Agen  Orontes' valour  Your sovereign deems to merit Cleonice  Whose piety forsakes the pomp of courts  The splendid ease of female life to attend  A father's steps amidst the clang of war  But for Arsetes thou rememberest well  When first he join'd to thine his social arms  He pledg'd his faith for five returning moons  To abide your welcome guest and now the tenth  Wanes in her silver orb  Tera  What says Agenor  My mind tho' loth recalls each circumstance  But still I hop'd Arsetes might be won  To breathe our friendly air still mix'd among  Bithynia's warlike sons now hovering o'er  The verge of hostile Pontus when the time  And place concurr'd to pour with sudden inroad  The storm of conquest on our hated foe  To avenge a form a worth so like his own  But see he comes  Enter  ARSETES  Belov'd Arsetes welcome  Youth at thy presence buds with bloom renew'd  Such as I was when on Arabia's sands  I crush'd the wandering robbers of the desert  Arse  My lord too partial friendship ever finds  New praise for your Arsetes if I claim  Of merit aught here Heaven receive my thanks  That bade me wield the sword for Lycomedes  Tera  And yet Arsetes now methinks forgets  To prize our country's honours while the bond  Of friendship holds no more his changing heart  That heart which once I press'd with transport here  Which seem'd with mutual transport to receive  The love I proffer'd when my bosom glow'd  With warmth of gratitude to him whose arm  Snatch'd Teramenes from impending death  As fierce Lysippus aim'd the threatening blade  At my defenceless head when you rush'd in  Till then unknown and sav'd me from the foe  Ars  'Twas sure some happy star that led my steps  At that blest momentif I sav'd the life  Of Teramenes I preserv'd indeed  A faithful counsellor for Lycomedes  An army's chief but for myself a friend  Tera  And wilt thou my Arsetes now forsake  The bands that late pursued the glorious task  Of conquest taught by theenow when the great  Th' important moment comes on which depends  Our monarch's fame our vengeanceled by thee  And brave Orontes we have stemm'd the tide  Of inbred tumult every rebel head  Now lies subdued and flush'd with great success  Our soldiers now demand with loud acclaim  To pour their fury o'er yon hostile bounds  Beneath Arsetes and Orontes  Arse  Heaven  Be witness here compulsive honour long  Has chanlleng'd my departureyet till now  I wav'd obedience to the frequent calls  Of duty but the flame of civil broils  At length subsiding thro' your troubled state  I must forgive me chief forgive me friend  Yield to the powerful voice and quit Bithynia  By every toil my sword has known in battle  But most the toils I shar'd with Teramenes  Unwilling and compell'd I leave your clime  And quit a country dearer than my own  Tera  Farewell Arsetes think that Teramenes  Feels from his in most soul the fix'd resolve  Of him whom once he fondly deem'd by fortune  From all mankind selected for his friend  I'll seek the kingno less will he regret  Arsetes' loss whose presence might insure  His wish'd revenge and fix his kingdoms glory  Exit  ARSETES AGENOR  Agen  Why droops Arsetes O discover all  Thy secret grief and let Agenor share it  Arse  Indeed thou dostmy every thought is thine  My other self my bosom's counsellor  What needs there more to rend my heart to fill  My tortur'd soul while loitering here I wrong  My native soil the voice of filial duty  Chides my delay yet Love the powerful God  Reigns in my breast and mocks each settled purpose  Come my Agenor with thy friendly aid  Confirm my thoughts and teach me yet to tread  Yet to resume the path my seet have left  To quit the land where all my joys are center'd  To tear myself from love and Cleonice  O nevernever  Agen  Yet again reflect  Think who you are to what has Heaven reserv'd  Your virtuesShall a kingdom's heir  Arse  Go on  'Tis honest chidingShall a kingdom's heir  Thus would'st thou say on whom th' expecting eyes  Of thousands look for happiness on whom  A father fixes every dearest hope  To see himself renew'd to distant times  Shall he forgetting all the claims of glory  Forgetting all the ties of filial duty  Defraud his longing people of their prince  And from his sire withhold a darling son  Sayshall Bithynia's hostile lands detain  From Artabasus' sight his loved Pharnaces  O noAgenorthou hast fir'd my soul  My fatheryes I will embrace the knees  Of him whose love reproaches my delay  Yet never Cleonice shall this breast  Forget its wonted flameIs it a crime  To adore the sum of all her sex's graces  Tho' wayward chance has plac'd the hopeless bar  Of lineal enmity between our loves  Agen  And yet my prince the indulgent hand of fate  Perchance may weave your future web of life  With threads of brighter dye even love itself  May find a way to clear the gloomy prospect  Discord perhaps may once again extinguish  Her hated torch that fires the rival nations  And Cleonice be the bond of peace  Too long already strangers have we lived  Alien from friends and home tho' Artabasus  Sent you beneath my father's guardian care  To learn hard lessons in the school of glory  Yet sure the parent suffer'd in that absence  Which as a king his virtue deem'd would raise  Your fame and fit you for a people's weal  Arse  Yes my Agenor oft his tenderest greetings  Have warn'd me to return when circling time  Had brought the period fix'd for my departure  Or when the pause of arms or honour's duty  Permitted me to quit the host of Rome  Agen  And yetmy prince  Arse  And yettoo true Agenor  I feel each just reproachthe land indeed  I left and journey'd o'er a length of soil  When fate for sure 'twas more than common fortune  Prompted my steps to tread Bithynia's realm  Where Lycomedes wag'd intestine war  With rebel arms  Agen  Thy generous valour then  Warm'd by the common cause of kings to assert  A prince's rights forgot thy country's foe  Arse  Full well thou know'st I vow'd to every God  By all the solemn ties that bind mankind  Ne'er to reveal while in this hostile land  My country or my birth this urg'd by thee  I swore when first I told thee my design  To gaze on Cleonice's wondrous charms  Agen  Nor vain the cautionthink O think how far  It yet imports to keep the mighty secret  Alas my friend I tremble had your father  Been conscious whither fortune led the steps  Of his Pharnaces could he know the land  Of Lycomedes now detains his son  Th' idea starts a thousand fears should now  Some dreadful chance betray you to the foe  I shudder at the thoughtthen let us hence  And to the longing troops of Pontus give  A blooming hero promis'd oft in vain  Then let us hastenby my father's shade  I now adjure youfor Pharnaces once  Rever'd his Tiridates  Arse  Witness Heaven  How dear I held himArtabasus only  Could claim a nearer duty o'er my heart  The guide the great example of my youth  Methinks I now recall the fatal day  That snatch'd him from usO my lov'd Agenor  The scene is present to my eyesI see  The battle rang'd when to my ardent gaze  His hand experienc'd pointed out the files  Of rigid war and taught me where to drive  The thunder of the field when Heaven so will'd  A distant arrow sent with deadly aim  Pierc'd his brave breast  Agen  Then midst the distant fight  It was not given Agenor's hand to close  A dying parent's eyes  Arse  These arms receiv'd  The venerable chief"Take take"  he cry'd  "This last embracestill let the dear remembrance  "Of Tiridates' counsels move his prince  "And for my sake be kind to my Agenor"  He could no more but left in thee his pledge  Of truth and amitysince which my soul  Has held thee ever partner of her same  Her better half her other Tiridates  Embrace  Agen  I am indeed thy Tiridatesyes  My father from thy seats of bliss and peace  See how thy prince rewards thy loyal faith  And in his love supplies a parent's loss  And yet forgive me prince thy words awake  Remembrance of that day for ever mourn'd  My father  Arse  Go Agenor since my last  Resolves are fix'dprovide whate'er requires  To quit this courtto quit my Cleonice  Tho' death is in the thoughtthy piety  Reproaches mineere yet the mounting sun  Whose early ray now gilds the face of morn  Attain his midday seat the camp of Pontus  Shall see Pharnaces and Agenor  Exit  Agenor  Arse  alone  Yet  Be still my beating heartO Cleonice  I feel her nowInstruct me every God  In soothing speechO teach my lips to breathe  In gentlest sounds the fatal wordfarewell  Orontes hereand is not this the blest  The destin'd husband of my Cleonice  I shall relapsefor if I thinkdistraction  Ensues and fame and peace are lost for ever  Exit  Enter  ORONTES  Oron  Sure 'twas Arsetes that malignant planet  That thwarts my course whene'er my fiery soul  Would eaglewing'd stretch her aspiring flight  He soars above me stillHave I not worn  The mask of loyal faith smooth'd o'er the dark  The sullen brow of deep design with smiles  My heart confess'd notWhat have I not done  For thee AmbitionLet not pale remembrance  Review the past or paint a scene to stagger  The sickly resolutiondeeds long done  That sleep secure from every mortal ken  Are but as shadows in the coward eye  Of conscienceHenceOrontes' soul disdains  The phantoms of remorse  Enter  ZOPYRUS  Now my Zopyrus  Speak hast thou aught that claims my ear  Zop  I learn  That the young stranger who so deeply witch'd  The madding multitude prepares this day  To leave Bithynia's court  Oron  It cannot be  Arsetesspeakwhat at this fated time  When war again unfolds his brazen portals  And Pontus brings to view its crested thousands  A tempting prospect yet untry'd to prove  His swordIt cannot be  Zop  This hour Agenor  Declar'd Arsetes' purpose  Oron  Speed it gods  Come near Zopyrus to thy faithful ear  I've oft disclos'd the secrets of my heart  Where Love but most Ambition holds his sway  This stranger is my baneI shrink beneath  His better Geniuseven the field that once  Crown'd this good sword with honours yields me now  But wither'd laurels which his brow disdains  While the blind herd on him with fullmonth'd clamour  Lavish their shouts  Zop  Yet fortune has secur'd  Your brightest hopeshas not our king declar'd  Orontes next by birth ascends the throne  Have not the assembled states confirm'd the right  Of just succession hastening on the steep  Of downward life our king though high in spirit  Blazing with wasting light that soon must fail  Shall sudden sink in night and leave to thee  A glorious rising to imperial greatness  Fair Cleonice too shall bless your bed  And with her beauty smooth the toils of empire  Oron  'Tis true the charms of Cleonice well  Might claim the tongue of raptureyet Zopyrus  While great Ambition's sun lights up my flame  The star of Love looks sickly at his beams  Zop  What more can crown your wish when Happiness  In all your soul aspires to soon shall open  Her welcome armsMeantime the king my lord  Esteems and holds you high above the rank  Of Nicomedia's nobles  Oron  True Zopyrus  Spite of the tardy warmth of cautious age  I've work'd me deep in Lycomedes' foul  By more than common zeal to avenge his son  But homebred faction spreading thro' the land  Compell'd us to the hated truce with Pontus  Till now nine moons elaps'd this upstart chief  Stept in to bear away the prize of arms  Due to my elder sword while Teramenes  With partial eye beheld his every deed  And idoliz'd the work himself had rais'd  Zop  Yet common rumour speaks that friendship holds  In strongest bands Orontes and Arsetes  Oron  Even so my friendand policy demands  That he who runs the mingled race of life  Should learn to veil himself and oft appear  The thing he is not  Zop  Should propitious Fortune  Remove your rival hence  Oron  If this report  Be true the dark eclipse that late has frown'd  No more my friend shall intercept my fame  The war's great field at this auspicious time  Begun shall not enrich a stranger's hand  But fall the harvest of Orontes' sword  Exeunt  ACT II  SCENE A garden with palmtrees olives and other Eastern plants  CLEONICE  alone  ALAS it will not be and fond remembrance  In vain recals the pastwhere where is now  That reason's boast which o'er creation lifts  The pride of man when fickle as the gale  That sweeps the blossom from the bough our passions  Veer with each hour and shake our best resolves  How is my bosom chang'dno longer now  From my example mothers teach the young  And tender maid who dreads each swelling wave  That heaves but gently o'er the stream of life  To rise superior to her sex's weakness  Enter ARSINOE  Arsi  Friend of my life whose partial choice has given  Arsinöe long the privilege to pass  The ceremonious bounds which birth and title  Had plac'd between us wherefore art thou chang'd  From her that lov'd and lov'd but her Arsinöe  Cleo  Still art thou here the partner of my heart  Then wherefore this reproach and why complain  Of change that never yet this breast has known  We were two plants that grew in friendship's soil  And promis'd fruits of neverdying love  Arsi  Then every care that Cleonice knew  Arsinöe too has shar'dbut late I've mark'd  That Cleonice different from herself  Shuns even Arsinöe's presence ever seeks  The lone recess and brooding o'er her thoughts  Nurses some hidden griefsoon war again  Shall loose its rageperhaps the threatening danger  Alarms your fear  Cleo  Thou know'st that I alone  Remain'd the comfort of a father's age  When fate that tore Polemon from the hope  Of his Bithynia from a husband's arms  A hapless consort sever'd thou remember'st  My mother sad Arete bow'd with grief  Soon mix'd her ashes with the son's she mourn'd  Then left in early youth my converse oft  Sooth'd a fond parent's pangs when recollection  Rais'd up the form of blessings lost for ever  While as I grew paternal fondness saw  With partial eye his Cleonice's mind  Expand beyond her sex hence not alone  The soft the winning talents that to life  Give female polish but the greater arts  Ennobling man were taught my ripening age  But o'er the rest my sire whose bosom glow'd  T'avenge his son enur'd my thoughts to cherish  Deep hatred of the soe by whom he fell  Arsi  Hatred and vengeance ill agree my friend  With tender grief like thineestrang'd from all  Thy wonted temper solitude bespeaks  Far other changeThen seek not to deceive  The searching eye of friendship  Cleo  Alas Arsinöe  I feel the woman herethou said'st but now  That war again must soon unloose its rage  Is there no cause for fear whate'er the tongue  Of stoic fortitude may boast the mind  The generous mind that owns life's dearest ties  Will nourish feelings pride disdains to own  Arsi  Revolve our present state our country's sword  Now us'd to victory gives high expectance  Of future triumphs while for you my friend  If love if grandeur charm Bithynia's throne  Shall raise you high and Hymen light his torch  At Cupid's flameIs not the first of men  The first of heroes yours Yes Cleonice  Each anxious doubt shall fleet like morning mist  And all be lost in your Orontes' arms  Cleo  Orontes' armsO Heaven what have I said  By every tie of loveBut whitherwhither  Now rove my thoughtsLeave me leave me my Arsinöe  To brood in secret o'er my treasur'd sorrows  Arsi  Scarce from her tenth fair crescent has the moon  Silver'd night's fleecy robe since I've beheld  Tho' silent I've beheld thy alter'd mien  Methinks ere since the day when 'midst the ranks  Of rebel arms my father 'scap'd with life  Sav'd by the gallant aid of brave Arsetes  Ha thou art paleand now the mantling blood  Returns once moreWhat can this meanMy heart  Has caught the alarm and Oh my soul forebodes  Distress and anguish to my hopeless love  aside  Cleo  It must be sohence every vain respect  I can no more dissembleHeat Arsinöe  Hear then and pity Cleonice's weakness  While Lycomedes with a monarch's care  Plans future schemes of greatnessCleonice  Lost to herself her rank her sex's glory  Doats on the merits of a youth unknown  Arsi  Orontes then  Cleo  Orontesname him not  I own his worthI own the sacred rights  A king and father claimbut I must own  Tho' while I speak confusion fills my soul  Arsetes bears down all and tho' the pride  Of fortune rais'd me high above his hopes  A pleader here which nothing could withstand  By looks by deeds by all that can ennoble  The pride of youthful manhood had prepar'd  My easy bosom to receive the guest  That n  w sole tyrant reigns my bosom's lord  Arsi  Then am I lost indeed  aside  Cleo  Go my Arsinöe  And learn if aught is rumour'd that pertains  To my Arsetessoon this favourd hero  Will leave Bithynia's courtbut still remember  Veil'd in thy faithful breast to keep my secret  To thee I trust my life my fame my all  Exit  Arsin  Cleon  alone  Lost and bewilder'd still I rove in fate's  Distressful labyrinthWhy Cleonice  Why didst thou leave the

sage  For ever watches o'er his country's weal  Has found the happy means to fix him here  To graft his virtues on Bithynia's stock  Blest earnest of revenge  Cleo  What means my father  aside  My lord the duty Cleonice owes  Her country's welfare and her father's honour  Demands my thanks for every aid that Heaven  Gives to Bithynia's strengthand sure Arsetes  Stands first in martial praiseBut

valour  Our friend our Teramenes joins to his  Arsinöe's hand and gives in such a son  A great ally in Lycomedes' cause  Led by Orontes' and Arsetes' valour  What may Bithynia's squadrons not atchieve

observ'd  His bosom labouring with the stifled passion  Of recent birth and well I know my daughter  Owns with a virgin blush Arsetes' virtues  Nor could a youth whose fortune only rests  In his own merits and his sword refuse  That hand which Nicomedia's noblest peers  With transport would receive  Lyc  Why droops my daughter  Still cherish hope a train of better days  Succeeds where vengeance brightens up the prospect  My age's darling 'tis for thee my soul  Still labours tho' declining years would fain  Woo me to shades of peaceto raise thee high  With thy Orontes and avenge my boy  I

And nothing now remains but that we quit  Bithynia's court for Artabasus' camp  What mean those looks of sorrow wherefore heaves  Your swelling breast while clouded with despair  Your eyes in silent

conference open'd with the foe  But this distressful fate mysterious Heaven  Has cast on poor Araxes baffles all  And leaves me lost uncertain whither points  This deed or what inhuman breast design'd

Think not  That Artabasus will condemn the love  That honour sanctifiesfor Cleonice  If ever Rumour's tongue can claim belief  She merits all you feelNay more my soul  Could witness Lycomedes' regal virtues  Did not ambition that excess of kings  That thirst of widen'd empire that too far  Inspir'd his early reign now eve  in age  Impel him to unsheath invasion's sword  The king who urg'd by partial glory breaks  The sacred ties that link a social world  Should boast no more the image of those Gods  Whose wide benevolence extends o'er all  Phar  Still still my hopes with fond presumption form'd  Ideal scenes of happinessCould Peace  With outstretch'd arms embrace the warring nations  Could Lycomedes learn one selfsame spirit  Inform'd his foe Pharnaces and his once  Belov'd ArsetesYet

Bithynia's king try every art  Of eloquence to bend his soul to terms  That fit the king and fatherGrant it Heaven  The day that sees my lov'd Pharnaces happy  Gives Artabasus allThen close ye Powers
