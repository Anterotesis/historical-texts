 THE SPANISH LADY A MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT IN TWO ACTS Founded on the PLAN of the OLD BALLAD  As performed at the TheatreRoyal in  CoventGarden  Will you hear of a SPANISH Lady  How she woo'd an ENGLISH Man  OLD BALLAD  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR  PREFACE  _THE Author of this little Piece having already thought it incumbent on him to explain in the public Paper his Motives for writing it and the Reasons why it did not make it's Appearance on the Stage at that time he presumes a Repetition of those will be the most proper Preface to it here  The elegant Simplicity of the Old Ballad which has been justly remarked by many writers of allowed Taste had often induced me to wish to see it modelled into a Petitepiece The Advice of a singular Conquest obtained over Spain in the Year influenced me to attempt it I thought the Scene might not improbably be laid there and that some few Hints tending to illustrate and as far as so small a Production might be able to perpetuate that glorious Exploit  would while popular Praise and Admiration was alive and warm attone for what Deficiences might be found in the Conduct and Diction such a kind of Undertaking being really new to me  With this View the Piece was received licensed and rehearsed at  CoventGarden  the Winter before lastbut the Disturbances which then happened at both Theatres obstructed the intended Performance  If now stands as a simple Fable and may be considered merely as the Story of the SPANISH LADY brought forward into View If in the principal Scene between the English Officer and the Lady I have not wholly destroyed the pathetic Simplicity of my Original I should hope with the Assistance of the Music which has been selected under the Inspection of an eminent Composer that the Piece may not be found unentertaining to a delicate and a feeling Mind Wherever I could I have used the very Words of the Ballad which for the Satisfaction of a curious Eye I have hereunto annexed  In this plain Dress my Production now appeals to the Candour of an English Audience  And is  WITH THE HIGHEST DEFERENCE AND RESPECT DEDICATED TO THE BROTHERS  Persons Represented  MEN  WORTHY a noble  English  Officer

did your Vessel weather out that dreadful Hurricane last Night  LIEUTENANT  Why tolerably well at last And yet I thought sometimes we shou'd never have crack'd Biscuit again In all the Voyages I have made and I have rode out many a hard Gale I never was so near going to the Bottom You Landmen now lie safe enough  ENSIGN  I don't know what you mean by safe the Devil cou'd not have slept in such a Storm I'll swear the Fort shook about our Ears with ten Times the Violence it did when the Mine was sprung and I was more alarm'd Yet Lieutenant that was no trifling Work  LIEUTENANT  Trifling No faith for that resolute Dog the Governor laid about him like a Devil  st SOLDIER  Poor Fellow It so griev'd the Heart of me to see him when the cowardly Rascals had all left him oblig'd to give up his Sword that I cou'd have cry'd for him if I had not thought it a Shame for a Soldier in Action  d SOLDIER  Ay but Ben shall you ever forget our Commander's Usage of him upon that Occasion I cod 'tis my Opinion the Governor was not very sorry to lose his Friends when he found so good an Enemy  LIEUTENANT  Ensign can you tell me where your good Commander  Worthy  is I have a Message to him from our Admiral  ENSIGN  I expect him here every Moment He went to the Governor's just now and said he wou'd return soon I am waiting fresh Orders  LIEUTENANT  I'll bear you Company  ENSIGN  In the mean Time prythee lets have Tom's Song that he wrote upon the Action  LIEUTENANT  I'll oblige you as well as I can Lads remember to chime in  SONG  I  Cheer ev'ry Morn with loud Huzzas  Now the great Work is

Exit with Sailors  WORTHY  Ensign a Word Have you seen the poor Widow and her Children to Day  ENSIGN  I have SirThe Children are all purely except the Eldest who seems chain'd to her Mother's Chair 'Tis hard to say which of the two has cry'd most When I gave her the Purse she wou'd have express'd her thanks but her Amazement a while prevented her At last she had just sighed out your Name when I produced her poor dead Husband's Watch which I discover'd last Night at George Ravage's the very sight of it threw her into such an Agony that I was oblig'd to leave it in her Lap and run off It was too much for me  WORTHY  You give me Pleasure to hear you say so Good Morrow good Ensign When you repeat your Visit only caution them never to discover my Name and let it on your part be kept equally Secret  ENSIGN  I'll be sure to observe you with Care Sir you have no farther Commands at present  WORTHY  None but to desire you will be early enough with me in the Morning that we may have sufficient Time for the charitable Duties we are engag'd in  ENSIGN  You may depend upon me Sir I receive your Orders with Pleasure Good Morrow Sir  Exit with Soldiers  WORTHY  Ensign your Servant I like this young Fellow The Readiness and Satisfaction with which he undertakes a good Action are singularly agreeable Such a Disposition reflects Pleasure on itself and doubles every Favour to the Object it obligesHow truly valuable in a Soldier when Success has crown'd his Arms  SONG  A Triumph that never can fade  In the Conqueror's Bosom must spring  When conscious he duly has paid  His Debt to his Country and King  But a Pleasure surpassing it far  The sweetest the Heart can receive  Is to fuccour the Victim of War  And the State of the Wretched relieve  Enter  HEARTY  So Major you have finish'd your Visit Well will you return and dine with this good Family I have promis'd myself to them  HEARTY  Not to Day Sir I have some Engagements which I think will not release me Time enough beside I have no great Pleasure in seeing the poor Girl dine upon looking at you  WORTHY  Again You will still persist in that Mistake  HEARTY  No Mistake indeed Sir Her Confusion when you enter the Room unceasing Sighs during your Stay Attention when you speak  WORTHY  All easily to be accounted for Her obsequious Regard to one whom she cannot look on yet but in the Light of her Conqueror her hourly Anxiety for her Father's Situation his Wounds not promising so favourably as might be wish'dA thousand Interpretations may be made of her Behaviour  HEARTY  All surely conducing to prove the Truth of what I say  WORTHY  To me it does not appear so nor can I yet with all you can say give into the idle Vanity of indulging such Notions as would be inconsistent with my Principles and Situation  HEARTY  Your Principles indeed I am no Stranger to nor am I wishing you should break thro' them all I presume to urge is that if you were inclin'd so to do here is a fair Occasion offer'd you  WORTHY  'Tis an Experiment I shall not be induc'd to make yet were I ever so strongly inclin'd to it it must be Length of Time and very plain Circumstances alone could convince me of the Fairness of such an Occasion I cannot bear that cruel Misinterpretation of a Woman's Behaviour which supposes her Goodhumour and Affability can have no End but Love  SONG  I  With Scorn I view that InsectRace  Who blemish Woman's fairest Grace  Those Flutt'rers of an Hour  In wanton Mischief who destroy  Good humour's earlyopening Joy  Sweet as the Maymorn Flower  II  Shake Shake them off ye Fair in haste  They poison ev'ry Bud they taste  And stray but to devour  Oh may they ne'er successful be  Ne'er sip the Bloom of Beauty's Tree  Sweet as the Maymorn Flower  III  Give me great Love my Fav'rite one  I tune the Note to her alone  Her Truth my constant Theme  With her may ev'ry Hour of Life  Flow sweetly on unvex'd with Strise  Smooth as the gliding Stream  Exeunt  SCENE a CHAMBER  ELVIRA  discover'd writing after a Pause rises  ELVIRA  How many Doubts perplex me Yet what have I to apprehend The Greatness of his Soul and Gentleness of his Disposition leave no Room for Fear He must be consistent And shou'd his Judgment condemn his Delicacy cannot but forgive a Weakness which his own Virtues have given Birth to  SONG  I  Not caught by the liking alone of an Eye  Do I languish in secret and heave the fond Sigh  By Passion and Virtue at once I'm undone  And Reason compleats all that Love had begun  II  Tho' lovely his Air and inspiring his Look  As the Ray of the Morn when it plays on the Brook  Yet both of them far less engaging I find  Than the Ray of that Glory that beams from his Mind  Why must such exalted Goodness be fatal to me alone to every other Breast he brings Ease and Satisfaction to  me Heaviness and Despair If all of his Nation are like him how happy the Women that are united to them Even to his Foes he shews so lovely that his Beneficence and humane Care of all around him make him appear rather a Father than a Conqueror The Hours that he has sat by my Father's Bed consoling him and the sweet Means he has us'd to dry my Mother's TearsI'll hesitate no longer I cannot be deceiv'd in him  goes to sit down  Enter  ANNA  ANNA  My dear Sister I am glad I have found youWhat crying again  ELVIRA  No my Sweet I am not crying now  ANNA  Ay but you have

Father's Life is in Danger and our Town in the Hands of our Enemies  ANNA  Nay my Papa is much better now and for the TownI have always been told Sister that Enemies were proud and cruel but these People are as friendly and kind as you are to me And I'm sure one of the Captains beat his own Man soundly in the Street t'other Day only for offering to hurt my little LapDog  ELVIRA  My sweet the Cruelty is all over now and English People never hurt their Enemies when once they have subdued them  ANNA  No indeed I think we are as happy as ever we were and they are very pretty People Dear how I love to look at the Gentleman at Table What low Bows he makes And how goodnatur'dly he smiles Well if ever I live to be marry'd I hope I shall have just such a Husband as he is    Elvira  turns away concern'd  Sister I hope I han't said any Thing to offend you I can't bear to see you so  ELVIRA  No my little Dear you can't offend me  ANNA  Indeed I wou'd not if I knew it What can be the Matter with you I'll be whipt if you han't learnt to cry of the Gentleman  ELVIRA  Go you little Trifler Soldiers never cry  ANNA  No I vow I saw him myself wipe his Eyes as he went out of the Room the Morning the Doctor give my Papa overand I heard Papa himself tell my Mama that he thought he did so when he gave him his Sword again after the Fight for that he turn'd away his Head and cou'd hardly speak  ELVIRA  Oh the lovely Heart of him He was sorry my Dear to see my Papa hurt  ANNA  But what are you sorry for Deuce take me but a thought's come into my Head if I were not afraid you'd be angry  ELVIRA  I won't my little Love tell me  ANNA  I'll be whipt if you don't love the Gentleman  ELVIRA  The GypseyWhy so my Sweet how shou'd you know any Thing of Love  ANNA  I don't know to be sure but I think I can guess a little I'm not such a Child as that neither  SONG  I  I've heard when down the Maiden's Cheek  The Chrystal Tears are falling  And Sobs prevent the Tongue to speak  The Heart is past recalling  That Cupid then at every Moan  Will bolder grow and bolder  Yet this I can but guess alone  Till I'm little Olderno  Till I'm a little Older  II  That then she'll languish pine and weep  Till she her pain discover  And not a single Instant keep  At Distance from her Lover  Nor ever feel a Moment's Ease  Till in his Arms he fold her  But this I may do more than guess  When I'm a little OlderSure  When I'm a little Older  ELVIRA  My sweet little Companion now is your happiest State if you did but know it You are wishing for the Hour  that may be fatal Love to your unskilful Mind is a Dream of perfect Happiness it's Pains and Woes you have no Idea of and may you never know 'em  SONG  Ah me what Pains invest the Heart  Where Love has fix'd his rankling Dart  Wishingyet dreading to discover  I'ts Torment to the heedless Rover  Endless Groans those Pains confessing  Past conceiving past expressing  Silent ever doom'd to languish  Till it hopeless break with Anguish  ANNA  I've interrupted you tho' with my NonsenseI'll go if you please Sister and leave you to finish your Writing  ELVIRA  My dear I can do that without your going  As she goes to the Table  Anna  recalls her  ANNA  O Sister pray is Writing a Sign of Love  ELVIRA  Why my Child  ANNA  Why if it is I wish the Gentleman is not in love  ELVIRA  Ha Why  Anna  ANNA  Because I stood by him Yesterday while he was folding up some Papers and I do verily believe he had filled twenty Sides  ELVIRA  In all my Distraction of Mind that Fear never occurr'd to meHow do our Passions blind us Could Virtues like his fail of Attraction and have not English Ladies peculiar Charms Shou'd it be so I am lostIf not my only Hope is here I'll not delay a Moment  Going  Anna  again recalls her  ANNA  O Sister one Word more  ELVIRA  What now you Trifler  ANNA  Why you have not Time to write now for Dinner's ready and the Gentleman has been waiting in the Parlour this half Hour  ELVIRA  Why did not you tell me before You little heedless  w  at do you expect  ANNA  Wh  that you'll go to him directly Sister but don't say I rept you For I wou'd not have him angry with me for ever so much  ELVIRA  SONG  To thee bright Queen of Love  I thus address my Pray'r  In Pity my fond Suit approve  And make Distress your Care  Oh pierce the Bosom of the Youth  And bid it bleed like mine  With Gratitude and endless Truth  I'll deck thy sacred Shrine  Exit  ANNA  Yes I thought soThe Murther's all out Yet I don't know some how or other what my Sister says about Love don't seem like the Song Mamma taught me and which she is so fond of because Papa made it for her just after they were marry'd  SONG  I  Great is the Treasure  When cooing  And wooing  We hope for no Pleasure  But that of our Love  II  Yet more Sincere  More tender and dear  When coying  And toying  Hearts wanton in Pleasure  No Doubt can remove  III  When once the tender Sigh discovers  The soothing State of mutual Lovers  Then ev'ry Day  In Blessing  Past guessing  Each Hour confessing  Their Fondness encreasing  Oh how sweet it flies away  On downy Pinions gay  How sweet away  Exit  ACT II  SCENE a  Hall  in the  Governor'sHouse

 Garments gay and rich as may be  Deck'd with Jewels she had on  Of a comely Countenance  And Grace was she  By Birth and Parentage  Of high Degree  As his Pris'ner there he kept her  In his Hands her Life did lie  Cupid's Bands did tie them faster  By the Liking of an Eye  In his courteous Company  Was all her Joy  To favour him in any thing  She was not coy  But at length there came Commandment  For to set all Ladies free  With their Jewels still adorned  None to do them Injury  Then said this Lady mild  Full woe is me  Oh let me still enjoy  My kind Captivity  Gallant Captain take some Pity  On a Woman in Distress  Leave me not within this City  For to die in Heaviness  They have set this present Day  My Body free  But my Heart in Prison still  Remains with thee  Why should'st thou fair Lady love me  Whom thou knowest thy Country's Foe  Thy fail Words make me suspect thee  Serpents lie where Flowers grow  All the harm I think on thee  Most courteous Knight  I wish the same on me  May fully light  Blessed be the Time and Season  When you came on Spanish Ground  If that you may our Foes be termed  Gentle Foes we have you found  With our City you have won  Our Hearts each one  Then to your Country bear away  What is your own  Rest you still you gallant Lady  Rest you still and weep no more  Of fair Lovers you have Plenty  SPAIN doth yield you wondrous Store  SPANIARDS fraught with Jealousy  We oft do find  But ENGLISHMEN throughout the World  Are counted kind  Leave me not unto a SPANIARD  Thou alone enjoy'st my Heart  I am loving young and tender  Love is likewise my Desert  Still to serve thee Day and Night  My Mind is prest  The Wife of every Englishman  Is surely blest  It would be a Shame fair Lady  For to bear a Woman hence  English Soldiers never carry  Any such without Offence  I will quickly change myself  If it be so  And like a Page will follow thee  Wheree'er you go  I have neither Gold nor Silver  To maintain you in this Case  And to travel is great Charges  Which you know in ev'ry Place  My Chains and Jewels every one  Shall be thy own  And eke ten Thousand Pounds in Gold  Which lies unknown  On the Seas are many Dangers  Many Storms do there arise  Which will be to Ladies fatal  And force Tears from watry Eyes  Well in Troth I shall endure  Extremity  For I could find in my Heart to lose  My Life for thee  Courteous Lady leave this Fancy  Here comes all that breeds this Strise  I in ENGLAND have already  A sweet Woman to my Wife  I will not falsify my Vow  For Gold nor Gain  Nor yet for all the fairest Dames  Which are in SPAIN  Oh how happy is that Woman  Who enjoys so true a Friend  Many Days I pray God send her  Thus of my Suit I make an End  On my Knees I Pardon crave  For this Offence  Which Love and true Affection  Did fi  st commence  Commend me to that gallant Lady  Bear to her this Chain of Gold  With these Bracelets for a Token  Grieving that I was so bold  All my Jewels in like sort  Take thou with thee  For they are fitting for thy Wife  But not for me  I will spend my Days in Prayer  Love and all his Laws defy  In a Nunn'ry I will shrowd me  Far from any Company  But ere my Prayers have an End  Be sure of this  To pray for thee and thy Lady  I will not miss  Thus farewell thou gallant Captain  Farewell to my Heart's Content  Count not Spanish Ladies wanton  Tho' to thee my Heart was bent  All Joy and true Prosperity  Remain with thee  The like thereof fall to thy Share  Most fair Lady
