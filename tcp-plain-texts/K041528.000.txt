 A POEM SACRED to the Glorious MEMORY Of our LATE Most Gracious SOVEREIGN LORD King GEORGE Inscribed to the RIGHT HONOURABLE  George Dodington  Esq  By RICHARD SAVAGE Son of the late Earl  RIVERS  DÆ²BLIN  Printed by S POWELL for G RISK G EWING and W SMITH Booksellers in  Dame  's  street  MDCCXXVII  A POEM c  _LET gaudy  Mirth  to the blithe Carrolsong  In loose lightmeasur'd Numbers dance along  Thou  Muse  no flow'ry Fancies here display  Nor warble with the chearful  Lark  thy Lay  In the dark Cypress Grove or mossgrown Cell  Where dreary  Ravens  haunt would  Sorrow  dwell  Where  Ghosts  that shun the Day come sweeping by  Or fix in melancholy  Frenzy  's Eye  Yet now she turns her Flight to Scenes of State  Where  Wealth  and  Grandeur  weep the Frowns of Fate  Wealth Want Rank Power here each alike partakes  As the Shrub bends the lofty Cedar shakes  To her wide View is no Contraction known  Tis Youth 'tis Age the Cottage and the Throne  O  Exclamation  lend thy sad Relief  O  Dodington  indulge the righteous Grief  Distant I've long beheld in  Thee  transcend  The Poet Patron Patriot and the Friend  Thou who must live in  Truth  's remotest Page  Form'd to delight and dignify an Age  Whose Words whose Manners and whose Mind declare  Each Grace each Moral and each Muse are there  Accept this Po'esy void of venal Aim  Made sacred by thy  Royal Master  's Name  But why O  Muse  are songfulHours thy Choice  Lost is the Life whose Glory lifts thy Voice  GEORGE is no more As at the doomful sound  Of the last Trump all  Nature  feels the Wound  Each private each distinguish'd  Virtue  bleeds  And what but  Lamentation  long succeeds  Where wilt thou then for apt Allusions fly  What Eloquence can throbbing Grief supply  Late golden  Pleasures  urg'd their shining Way  With GEORGE they flourish'd and with GEORGE decay  Now dusky  Woes  o'er varied Scenes extend  Groans rise Rocks echo and chill Damps descend  Grief  strikes my View with everweeping Eyes  At her wan Look each lively  Fancy  dies  In fear in hope dull rest or rufling Storms  Thus  Woe  besets us tho in various Forms  That dire Event of Youth's ungovern'd Rage  That dearbought Knowledge to declining Age  In  Want  in  Scorn  it haunts an humble State  Tis  Care  'tis  Envy  to perplex the Great  A Kingdom's Curse it in  Dissention  brings  Or heavier falls when falls the best of Kings  Worth it exalts when aiming to debase  Tis Virtue's Triumph or 'tis Guilt's Disgrace  It humbles Life yet dignifies our End  Reflection's Torment yet Reflection's Friend  Then let the  Muse  her meaning Notes resume  And pay due Sorrows to the hallow'd Tomb  Was there a Glory yet to Greatness known  That not in  Brunswick  's Soul superiour shone  Ill fare the  Man  who rob'd in purple Pride  To wounded  Worth  has no Relief apply'd  Benevolence  makes  Pow'r  to  Prudence  dear  When  Pity  weeps what Pearl excells the Tear  When not one  Virtue  glows to bless Mankind  When  Pride  's cold Influence  petrifies  the Mind  Let the  Prince  blaze with Jemsin  Wisdom  's View  An Emblem of the Rock where once they grew  Yet Springs gush out to prove ev'n Rocks can flow  In Rills refreshful to the Vales below  Why has he pow'r and why no heart to chear  Unseeing Eyes and Ears that will not hear  Swift as his Bliss shall his light Name decay  Who selfindulgent  sports  his Hours away  But Ohwhat Love what Honour shall he claim  Whose Joy is Bounty and whose Gift is Fame  He truly Great his useful Pow'r refines  By him discover'd  Worth  exalted shines  Exalted  Worth  th' enlivening Act repeats  And draws  new Virtues  from obscure Retreats  He as the first creative Influence prais'd  Smiles o'er the  Beings  which his Bounty rais'd  Such  Dodington  thy Royal Master shin'd  Such Thou the Image of thy  Monarch  's Mind  Nations  were ballanc'd by his guardian Skill  Like the pois'd  Planets  by the allpowerful Will  Mark the  Swede  succour'd mark th' aspiring CZAR  Check'd are his Hopes and shun'd the naval War  By GEORGE the  Austrian Eagle  learns to tower  While the proud  Turk  shakes conscious of her Power  But when her Menace braves our envied Shore  She trembles at the  British Lyon  's Roar  Trembles tho' aided by the Force of  Spain  And  India  's Wealth'gainst  Brunswick  All how vain  He bad  thy  Honour  Albion  foremost shine  His was the Care unmeasur'd Bliss was Thine  Yet oft against his Virtue  Faction  rose  An  Angel  if  thy  Monarch would have Foes  Come  Charity  Firstborn of Virtue's Line  Come meekey'd  Mercy  from the Seat divine  Pure  Temp'rance  Mistriss of a tranquil Mind  By whom each sensual  Passion  stands confin'd  Fix'd  Fortitude  from whom fierce  Peril  flies  By whom O Soul of Action Empires rise  Fair  Justice  Author of a Godlike Reign  Peace Plenty Liberty  adorn  thy  Train  Lov'd  Prudence  Queen of Virtues blissful Dame  Parent and Guide of each illustrious Aim  From whose firm Step  Confusion  turns in Flight  That shapeless Spawn of  Anarchy  and  Night  From whom kind  Harmony  deduc'd her Race  Then  Order  all in one united Grace  And thou  Religion  truest heav'nly Friend  Whom  these  alone establish  These  defend  Assemble to the wailing Muse's call  Weep o'er the claycold Breast that held you  All  O  Death  rouze all those  Terrors  to thy Aid  Weak  Fear  or wisest  Valour  wou'd evade  Whether foul  Pestilence  in dire Array  Red  War  or paleey'd  Famine  point your Way  What can you more than Kingdoms overthrow  What aim'd you less when  Brunswick  felt the Blow  But markAUGUSTUS still above thy Rage  Steps forth to give a second GOLDEN AGE  Ye great  Plantagenets  distinguish'd Race  One greater meets you on celestial Space  And thou  Nassau  the fairest noblest Name  Ev'n mid the Blest superior still thy Flame  Behold an  Equal  nowHow dear th'Embrace  Oh flypresent him at the Throne of Grace  'Tis doneHe's crown'd with
