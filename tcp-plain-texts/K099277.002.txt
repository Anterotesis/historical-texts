 THE PUPIL OF PLEASURE  VOL II  THE PUPIL OF PLEASURE OR The New System Illustrated INSCRIBED  To Mrs EUGENIA STANHOPE  EDITOR OF LORD CHESTERFIELD's LETTERS  By COURTNEY MELMOTH  Versatile ingenium  VOL II  LONDON  Printed for G ROBINSON and J BEW in PaterNosterRow  THE PUPIL OF PLEASURE  c  LETTER LIX  Mrs  LA MOTTE  to Mrs  HOMESPUN  Madam  I AM sorry to refuse to the worthy Mr HOMESPUN who hath I perceive been obliged to return without his wife a request which I very plainly see  was made to me in the tenderness of his heart  You do me but justice in supposing that I will keep your unhappy secret as you very properly call it for it is no small infelicity to make a secret of  any  sort necessary to the fame of a woman and the peace of a whole family whose connections would all be dishonoured by a  disclosure  of it  As far therefore as my silence can contribute to your domestic tranquility you may depend upon me though I cannot but think she who hath confidence enough to abuse her husband should have policy enough to conceal the particulars of her crime from a confident since I know not whether the very knowledge of such circumstances is not an insult to her virtue  Your poor husband gave us yesterday as usual an admirable discourse but there was in it some softening sentiments relating to the pure pleasures of married felicity which I could not but imagine were suggested by his own situation he loves you HARRIET most fondly and I could not avoid giving to sentiments which I connected with certain others the tribute of a tender tearAll the parishioners and especially the talkative part of them express their astonishment some by whispers others by winks and  all  by looks that Mrs HOMESPUN should continue where she has neither relations nor acquaintances and it is easy to see that Mr HOMESPUN is the only unsuspicious person in the village while  he  wrapt up in the integrity of his soul and guarded by his good opinion of  you  supposes you  will soon regret his absence and return to him  After service he drank tea with me and with tears in his eyes first urged my going to BUXTON and then finding my refusal established that I should at least try the effect of my entreaties to invite you back he even went so far as to hint with all a  father  's glow upon his cheek at the little necessary preparations against the day in which you are expected to present him with a testimony of your tenderness There are various maternal cautions said he you know my dear Mrs LA MOTTE to be taken in such interesting situations and perhaps the constant bustles of that wateringplace may for awhile lull to sleep or rather agitate her into forgetfulness of those cares that generally alarm the provident apprehension  of  her  who is in a  very  few weeks to be a mother  This was too powerful a painting I rose to conceal my sympathy he pressed me by the hand in visible disorder and protesting that he left his fate to  my  management saluted me in his honest way and went to perform the last offices to a poor woman ALICE WELDON who died last Wednesday in childbed of the babe whose father is not yet acknowledged I told your husband HARRIET I would exert my power without telling him that I had long lost my influence over you  As you were not touched by my former lettersparticularly  one  of them I despair of moving you by the present having no new arguments to offer nor should I indeed have troubled you at all  but that I did it in compliance to your muchinjured and my everesteemed friend Mr HOMESPUN whom I admire chiefly for the very simplicity to which you have made objection By the ardour with which he speaks of that Mr SEDLEY upon all occasions I perceive that you have not been seduced by a novice and yet I cannot possibly imagine how he has contrived to make the husband his friend at the  very  time that he has betrayed the wife into the thorny paths of personal impurity Be this as it may he must be a very artful creature and exclusively of my not going into the same lodging with the polluted HARRIET I would not chuse to lay myself liable even to the insult of being the ridicule of a man who doubtless  asperses  even more than he  destroys  It may not however be amiss to observe in the conclusion of this letter that if your return to this place is not speedy it will probably be attended with consequences which no afterpenitence can possibly atone for  I am Madam Your humble servant C LA MOTTE  LETTER LX  From the Same to the Same  Dear Madam  MR HOMESPUN is extremely ill and much distressed by your refusal to return I have revolved the affair over in my mind and I see that if you come on the receipt of this letter very probable excuses may yet be made and all may be  happy  again  You are still dear to me HARRIET and I wish for nothing so warmly as to embrace you to go with you to our accustomed walk in the meadow opposite  your paradise of a cottage I miss you more and more every dayevery hour Come then my dear name the time and Mr HOMESPUN and I will both meet you at the halfway hut where we were so happy in a party last summer he desires you will take a chaise after you have acquainted us to that place  I can no longer be without you I want you to sit by my side near your favourite window round which the jessamine clambersand it is now in full blowto work with me while HORACE reads as he used to do some agreeable author We have made alterations in my garden there is a new summerhouse actually surrounded with roses sweetbriar and eglantine and I want  you  to approve of this In short I wish for you on all accounts both moral and entertaining Hasten then dear HARRIET to your  C LA MOTTE  LETTER LXI  From the Same to the Same  Mrs HOMESPUN  YOUR husband is in his bed brought thither by the evident indifference of a wife on whom he doats What course this illness may take or where it may end I know not the people here however do not scruple to attribute it to the absence and strange conduct of Mrs HOMESPUN Since his sickness which I do assure you is real I have considered  well  the part I am to take in this affair and in the hope of restoring a worthy member to the community by  opening his eyes to the demerit of the object for which he sighs I am not certain whether I shall not be justified in disclosing to him  that  which will induce him to change his anxiety into contempt  I beg  you  will think of this and as I shall wait your answer before I resolve allow yourself to prevent what must make your infamy  public  As to your equivocations they have no weight with me and are really too transparent to cheat a child It is evident you doat on your seducer  Farewel C LA MOTTE  LETTER LXII  Miss  DELIA DELMORE  to Lady  LUCY SAXBY  FANNY is not worse and therefore my spirits which always rise and fall with the pains and pleasures of my friends are equal to the delightful task of corresponding with my very dear Lady LUCY  In my last I only slightly and in general terms mentioned the patrons of my happiness let me now become particular My father has formed himself by such a standard that his excellencies have a dignity peculiar to the dignity of his manners He hath ever thought proper to include the friendly in the paternal character  and he inculcates even to the lowest domestics a certain sense of independency a principle he says necessary to be maintained even in servitude and from which branches forth a thousand virtues In society says Sir HENRY subordination is certainly indispensible according to the present system but then it should be considered that the balance of human affairs is oftener much more level than we imagine If  we  feed the poor it is their labour that accommodates  us  if we pay them for their toil it is that  very  toil to which we are indebted for all the softnesses of prosperity and if we provide them with a defence against the severity of seasons and a chamber for the convenience of their repose after they have wearied out their vigour in our service it may be remembered that in gratitude for our attention it is to them we are indebted for every thing that distinguishes  riches from poverty to their hands we owe the delicacies of the gardenthe treasures of the fieldthe decorations of the mansionthe table of plentythe robe of luxuryand the bed of down  Acting upon such singularlynoble motives Sir HENRY at a proper crisis makes each of his children in some sort independentthat is my dear he allots to each of us such a share of fortune in our own hands as is sufficient to the display and shewoff of the natural disposition He esteems it necessary to know the operation of the temper when it has power to play thissays heis  not  to be known by the common mode of contracting but of extending it is impossible to discover any natural propensity until opportunity gives liberty to all the little passions of the stripling and indulgence gives way to unshackled inclination  Educated under such advantages and the finer polishes of the school given by a father so venerable and superior the youthful independent will not turn his honours and the precious deposit entrusted to him to abuse and if he does even then there are many ways which Sir HENRY has discovered to turn his deviating conduct into the proper channel From kindness like this Lady LUCY we are enabled to do nameless occasional little services for the unfortunate and by such means learn early to form ourselves into habits of sympathy and tenderheartedness I do not put gold into your purses children like some parents who promise to double the sum if you shew it unbroken and undiminished at a future period I do not give it you to hoard up like misers nor dissipate like little spendthrifts but I give it you on purpose to change into small silver it is my desire that you  should taste early the first of pleasures look about you it is a world of misery as well as imposition mark your objects to the best of your abilitiesbe deceived as little as possible and double your treasure by decreasing it for sixpenny worth of silver gain sixty moments of fair reflection for the banquet at so cheap a rate provided to anotherthe bread and water of gratitudetake in exchange the richer feast of a kind heart and in this case my dear children which is the greatest gainer If you must be usurers put your money out to such interest be ambitious of laying it wisely out in the purchase of virtue and I will supply you chearfully with the means  We were all walking LUCY the other morning by the side of the bath when a short bold sturdylooking fellow accosted us for charity We looked at Sir  HENRY for our cue Come along children said he that man is both impudent and able As we passed by the fellow drew up his mouth and shaking a little dirty bag that he took from his pouch gingled it over his head and snapt his fingers When we were at some distanceTake care dear children of such impostors bestow not the moment you are supplicated try the temper of the petitioner he whom indigence and the strokes of illfortune have not at least humiliated is not yet an object of your generosity As we were going to our carriage a decayed veteran in tattered regimentals reduced to the knees by the perils of his profession was endeavouring to sweep our way with his hat little CHARLES ran without the least hesitation and gave his bounty Yes said Sir HENRY there my dear lad you could not be deceived by whatever means  brought about such a poor wretch must be the mark of liberality  Opposite LUCY to the maxims of the present age thus do our parents encourage us in proportion as we have conduced to the happiness of others and for every trifle wellbestowed we are rewarded with a present fourfold its value and that again enriched by a smile that shews how strongly the goodness of the child vibrates on the sensibility of the relation  It is another happiness peculiar to the retreat of Sir HENRY DELMORE that none of its residents are fired by the envy of opposition or the meanesses of jealousy so far the reverse of this that one is studious to compliment the other on some excellence fresh acquired or more perfected some display of the heart newly  discovered or some additional grace of the person that blooms in the blush sparkles in the eye or dimples in the smile  What my dear Lucy can we say to those whose hearts repugnant to such principles turn a deaf ear to the music of domestic concord Earthly groveling creatures how I pity them Warm however and alive to this sweetest harmony is my elegant Lady SAXBY she feels the soft impression that is made in every finer bosom by the hand of a divinity Long very long may this charming sensation continue As long may we remain in serious principle the friendsthe admirers the improvers of one another  I am my dear LUCY'S inviolable DELIA DELMORE  LETTER LXIII  Lady  LUCY SAXBY  to Miss  DELIA DELMORE  I SHOULD ill deserve the kindnesses you have been pleased to confer upon me did I refuse the earliest acknowledgment I am truly glad to hear Mrs MORTIMER is likely to recover and that you have found such a retreat as is agreeable to your family contiguous to the bath  Ah Miss DELMORE what pictures have you drawnhappy friendenviable DELIA and yet still methinks is there wanting one articleone principal figure to compleat your fine and highcoloured  familypiece Why my dear girl so forgetful of yourself Great as are your present felicities I am persuaded they admit addition There is a passion my DELIA that gives the last fine finish to the bliss of an innocent life it is the animator of every other happiness and I am surprised that a heart so gentle as Miss DELMORE'S should so long remain unpossessed of it The pleasures of a pure and mutual passion would not be unworthy her attention  Amongst the various characters in your train of slaves DELIA is there not one that can attract you Hardhearted girl how shall we contrive to captivate you Surely you terrify the tribe of humble servants A modern lover who has studied only his rotine of rhapsody and who depends on the repetition and arrangement of a certain number of warm wordshis  flames and fires hearts and darts thrills and hills groves and loves Cupids and stupidshas no sort of chance but when he has rung the changes and chimes till he can do nothing but ring them over again he is quite at a stand can go no farther and is lost in his own absurdity feels his own insignificance and makes his ridiculous exit Will you however  never  be caught  If the rocks of BUXTON are too barren pray hasten to your Worcestershire paradise your gardens therethe ancient seat of the DELMORE'Scontain every thing auspicious to the  belle passion  You have thickets of roses which may furnish your sighers with similies and abundance of bowers where Cupid may repose on violets you have beds of primroses to entertain the Silphids velvet verdure for the  dancing fairies and lucid water wherein Venus may bathe herself in brooksBut I am mistaken if you now need this poetical Arcadia BUXTON rocks have their beautiespray my dear let me hear more of this gentleman of birth rank and characterthis distinguished he whose conversation is so pleasing instructive and various who at first sight hath all the ease firmness and unembarrassed air of an old acquaintance and who presents himself so engaging to a company Ah DELIADELIA my prophecy will yet come to pass and if he proves as valuable as you wish to find himI know you wish it and so don't deny it DELIAthe most animated prayer of my heart is that it may be speedily necessary to alter my superscription whenever I address my fair and at present unestablished correspondent I am a very happy wife myself and therefore  have the better right and reason to desire you may be in the same situation However be this as it may in all states changes and transitions  I am truly Your real friend LUCY SAXBY  LETTER LXIV  Mrs  LA MOTTE  to Mrs  HOMESPUN  Madam  YOUR attachment to Mr SEDLEY is only an aggravation Your declaring that you love him and could sooner die than leave him is really the cant of a runaway romp of fifteen who deserves whipping for her naughtiness I have done both writing to and arguing with you and have only to give you notice that as Mr HOMESPUN is now really incapable of his duty through actual undissembled grief I have come to a resolution since neither entreaties nor any  humanity can weigh with you to acquaint him with every circumstance nay to make him a present of all your letters to me if you do not arrive at the Parsonage by Thursday next which is four days from the date of this I have hitherto fondly attempted to soothe your husband's impatience by making apologies he desires me to put a letter written with his own weak hand into the post he gave it me sealed and I inclose it  I am Madam Your most obedient servant C LA MOTTE  LETTER LXV  The Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to Mrs  HOMESPUN  Inclosed in the above  My dear Wife  BY some means or other I have caught as I think it is a cold and that has produced a fever so that I am obliged and that must excuse the badness of it to write this as I sit up in my bedthat bed my dear of which an equal part is your property Though I am not God be thanked ill enough to alarm you yet I cannot but believe your valuable society  would materially accelerate my return to health and contribute to my reestablishment Mrs LA MOTTE who always speaks of you with inconceivable tenderness has been prevented as she says on account of a sore throat from being with you and therefore as your company here would be quite a cordial and as BUXTON is not perhaps the proper place to be in without a relation even though that tie is almost supplied by the civilities of Mr SEDLEY to which worthy gentleman pray tender my hearty respects I could wish you would set off as early after your receipt of this as can be made convenient But I conjure you nevertheless not to put yourself into any hurries and by all means come in a postchaise and by easy stages and charge the driver to go easily and pray reward him for his care Never mind the cost of the journey consider your present delicate  situation and all the charming hopespart of which now bring the water into my eyesdepending upon it Therefore come leisurely and it is very likely as I don't indulge fretting under every slight affliction you may find me considerably amended on your arrival at our little retreat which though I am just at present not able to enjoy it is methinks prettier this summer than I imagined it would be for all the woodbines I planted have thriven wonderfully the laylocks particularly the purple ones are leafy and blossomed most luxuriantly and what I esteem an addition an innocent little wren has even in this the first season of my residence built her nest in the very center of my arbour between two honeysuckles I declare I would protect the poor thing and preserve to it all the rights of hospitality and good faith even at the hazard of my life  But where am I wandering You will smile when I tell you that though I  began  in great pain I  now  feel little or nothing except a weariness from the uncouthness of my posture Surely the very  reflection  upon a beloved object is a charm against misery What then and how powerful must be the  reality  I need not pursue the hint my best HARRIET is not destitute of sensibility  I am her very faithful and affectionate husband HORACE HOMESPUN  P S  I have a melancholy postscript for my dear HARRIET Poor Doctor DIGGORY has been long confined to his bed and  employed by the last post an amanuensis to acquaint me that he is incapable of using a pen Poor good man how I love and pity him  LETTER LXVI SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  OH THORNTON I wished for difficulties and they are come pouring upon me with a vengeance I am absolutely hemmed in by embarassments at this moment I am between a SCYLLA and a CHARYBDIS and uncommonly skilful must be my pilotism or I must split upon the rocks and be wrecked for ever Never was I since I set out a knighterrant to fight the world behind my more than sevenfolded shield of dissimulation so truly in danger of being discovered and thou knowest it is with me as with what the world calls a much better man  He that filches from me my  good name  Robs me of that which not enriches him  And makes  Me  poor indeed  But to come to the point THORNTON I am almost at the end of my wits HORACE HOMESPUN pines for his absent mate Mrs LA MOTTE refuses to come down and urges HARRIET to return upon peril of instant discovery This very hour did I see such a packet as astonished even  me  who am not startled at trifles LA MOTTE has written with the pen of a SAPPHO dipt in the ink of JUVENAL Such asperitysuch acumensuch a sting in the tail of every sentence HORACE too hath writtenwritten THORNTON though bedriddenfull of endearment full of carefull of the husband I called in upon HARRIET in the very crisis of my fate she had the whole packet spread upon the table before her and had just put the finishing to an epistle that would  have compleatly ruined me for ever had it been sent I caught it from her with the eagerness of a lion and I inclose it for thy inspection that thou mayst judge of my situation which is not at all mended by HARRIET'S violent declaration of ungovernable passion and wish to live with me for ever Oh that women could learn like me to gratify the passion of the hour and think no more of it but there is no seducing a woman into pleasure but she is so cursedly grateful as to hug the seducer for ever after without any regard to time or to place I have dined too at DELMORE'S and thrice caught the eye of FANNY By my soul the old fire is yet alive in her I can see it will only be necessary to nurse the embers and add fresh fuel How the duce came she to marry and how is it that being married she does not admire her husband who is one of the finest figures in the creationAs  for HARRIETshe must be sent home to the pedant there is no enduring either her fondness or the perils arising from it That damned LA MOTTEforgive my illbreeding THORNTON but that confounded woman will be my destruction Adieu Adieu I must cast about for an expedient  Yours PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER LXVII  Mrs  HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  Inclosed by  SEDLEY  in the above  BY all the agonies of an injured and desperate woman driven to the extreme by the pangs of conscience and the violences of love if you dare to betray me I will make you rue the consequence though I were to expire in the moment succeeding my revenge You know my spiritthen fear itdread it tremble before it I will not be discovered without making the discoverer pay for her treachery even with the blood of her heart I have not closed my eyes since the beginning of the week I am in a fever  I twice fell against the wainscoat this afternoon SEDLEY looks colder than he did but I love him better than either fame fortune food or existence his manner his addresshis figurehis obligingness even yet charm me I pity HORACE I love youindeed I doI could do any thing for either of you but leave the sight of Mr SEDLEYI ownI own it Take care thendo not sport with me do not abuse the trust I have put in you for once again I do most solemnly vow a resentment that shall exchange your  life  for the loss of my fame  Farewel HARRIET HOMESPUN  LETTER LXVIII THORNTON  to  SEDLEY  CHESTERFIELD is a cheat I am now sure of it Mr SEDLEY His system is not productive of bosomfelicity it cannot procure the best of all applauses or the approbation that results from a congratulating conscience however it may deceive the world into encomium Alas Sir what are the successes of hypocrisy or policy or whatever else  you  please to call it when after all the incense and enjoyment you receive from the public is paid to our conduct not as it really  is  but as it  appears  to be and when even after the luckiest efforts of our delusions when we have put the happiest of his  precepts in practicewe are condemned to that reflecting hour which at some time or another will seize us and which in despite of manner and pretence will have its full measure of recriminating asperity In the shame of my heart SEDLEY let me own to thee that I have been labouring to throw even the guarded virtue of Mrs VERNON off its bias I startled her for the moment but she recollected herself time enough to prevent her misfortune and I have had address enough to turn the accident to my advantage she believes me honest and she shall find me so I have not now time to relate the particulars of thisnor is it perhaps necessarybut I seriously wish I could inspire you with any degree of those feelings I at this moment enjoy from having totally discarded STANHOPE and listened to the voice of VIRTUE  Farewel JAMES THORNTON  LETTER LXIX SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  Sir  YOUR eternal reverberation of musty maxims becomes troublesome I did not adopt the plan of DORMER STANHOPE without sufficiently considering every part of it and if you can find no other subject of discussion than the old ragged threadbare commonplace topics of  Vice  and  Virtue  I must beg that our correspondence may be brought to a period As to what has pastif I did not know your sense of friendship it would be necessary to cut your throat as it is I wish you happy in your pursuits  I am yours PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER LXX  Mrs  HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  I WILL at all events be with you tomorrow the torment that sat brooding over my pillow last nightthe horrors of my dreamthe situation and trembling that seizes me as I write thisthe poor little wretch that seems troubled within meallall conjoin to draw me home I can stay no longer hereTell HORACE of my design and depend on its being put into execution by  Your HARRIET HOMESPUN  LETTER LXXI PHILIP SEDLEY  Esq  to the Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  Dear and Reverend Sir  I HAVE with infinite pleasure obeyed the injunctions suggested by Mrs LA MOTTE in hinting to Mrs HOMESPUN your anxiety for her return She heard me with great patience and very readily consented to go to a husband whom she so tenderly esteems I design to see her properly provided with a chaise and every thing necessary to the delicacy of her situation and I most heartily pray for your returning health I hope you will  forgive my having sent your lady my fair charge home without my attending her but you will reflect on the world's aptitude to asperse and censure and on that account forgive for the same reason I have advised Mrs HOMESPUN to go in the middle of the day that even a colour might not be given to the ready tongue of detraction Though Mrs HOMESPUN will be with you a few hours after this yet I could not forbear anticipating your felicity though it should even be but for a moment  I am Sir Your most obedient servant PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER LXXII  The Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to  PHILIP SEDLEY  Esq  Sir  THOUGH I am every minute looking out for HARRIET and have sent my servant to the corner of the town to welcome her and tell her I am made better by the expectation yet I cannot in duty refuse dispatching to you my thanks for your most generous and affectionate arguments and care No words are equal to such subjects I can only say to you that you have made a sick man well and a husband happy and that I  pay you the acknowledgment of a tear As to your rewardthat Sir is placed  beyond  me it is above and it must be given to you only by the Father of  all  recompence  I am Sir With a grateful heart Your most humble servant HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER LXXIII THORNTON  to  SEDLEY  CRUEL SEDLEYhow couldst thou treat me so harshly But I will neither quit urging to thee the subject of Virtue and painting to thee the horrors of Vice nor will I bring my epistolary correspondence to a period What have I myself escaped from the snare and shall I see the foot of a friend ready to be entrapped yet not endeavour to rescue him Forbid it fidelity forbid it honour Yes SEDLEY I must continue to love and will persevere in admonishing thee for in earnest repetition I declare to thee that I am certain all the finesse of thy CHESTERFIELD is unable to purchase the  delightful and soothing pleasures resulting from  my  present and newadopted system which I am not ashamed to tell thee although it is repugnant to thine is borrowed from the Scriptures it runs thus SEDLEY"Do as thou wouldst wish others should do unto thee" This is most palpably the sentiment of true policy as well as true honesty and I am every day more and more persuaded that nothing but this will in the end prevail There is a moment my dear dissipated SEDLEY in which though thou wert to wear the mask of a forty years success thou must perforce lay it aside and appear in all the nakedness of Nature And can there I ask thee can there possibly be a more hideous sight than a hypocrite unveiled when every deformity can no longer hide itself from observation when fraud shall be traversed through all its meandering intricacies even to its foul and polluted source  and when the very heart shall be displayed without subterfuge without concealments and without a possibility of either being on its own guard or throwing others off theirs By the by SEDLEY that sentiment borrowed as I perceive many of thine are from the pernicious volumes of thy darling theorist is subversive of all fairdealing in business true affection in the sacred connections with the other sex and ingenuousness of manners in all human situations  The Lieutenant is not yet returned but he hath sent two letters of which for certain reasons I have procured the favour of copies to inclose you If thou hast a single minute to spare from the prosecution of thy ruinous system read them and if after that thou art not made betterif they want efficiency to check thee in the pursuit of pleasure  through the bounds both of law and humanityfarewel to every hope of feeling farewel to all that ornaments the real gentleman farewel to manhood The first is addressed to me the second to Mrs VERNON On the receipt of mine which was the very day of my trial to ruin the fair subject of it judge what I felt you know my sensibility and can imagine thy THORNTON'S situation when it is poignantly wounded  LETTER LXXIV  Lieutenant  VERNON  to Mr  THORNTON  My dear Benefactor  GUESS how easily your former favour sat upon my heart by my readiness to receive from you another I had more reasons than you yet know of for inviting you to my villa and it was those reasons that prevented me from inviting my SOPHIA to partake of the excursion To tell you the plain truth my friend I have more policy than business in this excursion I have lately had offers of prefermentTo speak openly I can have the command of a company upon joining  General in AMERICA The halfpay of a Lieutenant you know Sir is not sufficient to even a man of moderation my wife's private fortune I have very strictly settled upon herself as a sort of comfortable security against unfortunate contingencies I think myself no more entitled to touch the interest of this than I would infringe upon a property in trust which after my decease was to be the only certain resource of the person under my guardianship Another point is my own thirst of glory I was trained very early to the exercise of arms and although I continued to starve upon my ensigncy for near twenty yearsI weep with joy Sir when I think upon the generous means by which I became a Lieutenantyet the ardours of military ambition are by no means extinguished I declare to you Mr THORNTON even blest as I now am  in a competent income presented to me with the hand of SOPHIAin the full possession too of SOPHIA herselfI cannot even at this time hear the beat of a drum without feeling my heart bound at the alarm In a word I design to go to the field and accept the promotion I am one of those who side with that party which considers the dignity of Britain insulted by America I was bred a soldier and taught even from my cradle for my father had won his laurels to feel all the delicacies of martial majesty In my opinion Sir the Sovereign of these realms is injured his injuries are mine it is enough for a soldier to believe his cause is just I perceive many of my old comrades have voluntarily drawn the sword while mine is gathering rust in its sheath I drew it Mr THORNTON last night out of the scabbard and upon examining the  blade I saw a spot a lazy spot of inactivity destroying the noble keenness of its edge By my soul I felt myself blush at it nor can I be ever easyever forgive myselftill I have at once wiped away the shame and the spot as it becomes my station Now then Mr THORNTON we are come to the pointa point of all others in the world the most delicate SOPHIA my poor SOPHIA must must Excuse me dear THORNTONexcuse a blot which my weakness has I see made upon the paperA tender woman will at any time unsoldier the boldest of us But fie upon it fie upon it 'twas the infirmity but of a moment "I am a man again" In short Sir my wife knows nothing of my intention and  I  do not know how to break the matter to her She has peculiar gentleness of heart and will I am convinced feel the severest  pangs at parting This is the first time since our marriage that I have slept from her side and I wish much to know how the has supported it if tolerably well she may perhaps be brought to bear the thoughts of a longer absence and in that case I would have you gradually open the design to her of which indeed I distantly hint in my letter to her The worst of it is Mr THORNTON women are so apt to associate with the duty of a soldier such horrid ideas of death broken bones groans and cannonballs that they give a man over the moment he marches from their embraces to front the enemies of their country however let us not blame the softness that was designed to soothe us to polish our ruggedness and harmonise our natures The drift of my letter is evident to you SOPHIA must know it the summer is advancing many  of our troops are midway betwixt the contending countries some of them are arrived at the theatre of the war I have but a few days to spare Dalliances must in no wise be indulged they are too effeminating I dare not trust myself with them My absence is propitious to the disclosure You are not unskilled in argument you want not the advantages of persuasive eloquence to you therefore I trust the tranquility of a wife's bosom Inspire her if possible my worthy Mr THORNTON with the duty she owes to my character which longer idleness would utterly obliviate Awake in her those sparks which I hope even a female nature sometimes experiencesthe sparks of patriotism But if you find this impracticableat least obtain her consent to my departure and support her sinking spirits with the hopes of my return and with  the expectation of the honours rewards and various distinctions which will  thew  attend me These are the points I leave to my good THORNTONand I am his  Most faithful servant CAESAR VERNON  LETTER LXXV  Lieutenant  VERNON  to Mrs  VERNON  Dear SOPHY  I FIND business will engage me from pleasure that is from your society longer than I at first believed but you are I know too well established in the moral duties to repine at what is necessary to be done even though your acquiescence is to be attended with some inconveniences Nay I am not sure whether if at any time my country should require me in the way of my profession you are not heroine enough to lend those arms to  your King which were they in such an exigence reluctant would be wholly unworthy to incircle yoursI shall never forget the glorious week we passed together soon after our union when we made a purchase of Mr POPE'S Version of HOMER and employed our long delightful evenings in reading him through Do you recollect with what earnestness we attended every hero in his progress How we joined in the resentment of ACHILLES detested the injustice of AGAMEMNON and pleaded the cause of the good old father of the fair CHRISEIS Pray call to mind with how much ardour we followed HECTOR to the field how we despised the pusillanimous harehearted PARIS and though we pitied the drooping ANDROMACHEthough we wept over her woesyet we should have felt for her still more had she not endeavoured to detain the  warrior from his duty Nor can you help recollecting with how much pleasurea pleasure that was radiant in your dear eyes SOPHIAyou heard of the various victories atchieved and related by the narrative NESTOR of his triumphant returns to his native country after the laurels of conquest were waving in his helmet while the patriotic virgins were scattering in his path the incense of the Spring and the emulous youths bowed to the victor and sang the song of success before him Before we had reached the Twelfth Book you was half a hero and with the shield and buckler of MINERVA her  wisdom  is already in your possession you would now be fit to take the field arrange the file and inspirit at once by your courage and beauty the soldiers of your  own  CAESAR Do you know SOPHY that I am child enough to be vain of the name that  was given me by my godfathers and godmothers There is conquest in the sound and I have a soul that pants I must confess to be ranked amongst the ROMAN CAESARS But ah SOPHIA I am only a disbanded unemployed Lieutenant and the little glory that I gained in the field in the days of my youth is now entirely faded and without one mark of the swordwithout one  apologizing  scar by which might be seen the necessity of retreat I am withering in the eye of my King and country and shall after a few years fall into an inglorious grave and be no more remembered  At a villa in SUSSEX through which I passed and where I stopt to dine I was told of a mansion which strangers usually went to survey the property of a veteran officer whom I fought with side by side  in the first battle that fleshed my arm I have a thousand times mentioned him to you under the wellknown name of FRASER The old man hath left two of his limbs in different parts of the globe FRANCE hath the honour of his arm and his right leg adorns the plains of MINDEN but the trunk is whole and seems to have acquired fresh vigour from lopping the branches Hardihood hath settled the rose of high health in his cheek the sun hath seasoned his complexion to the heat of the Torrid Zone and the hair of his head is like the whiteness of a hermit's beard that spreads itself beyond the girdle He knew me at the first sight and pressed my hand with an honest roughness that denoted sinceritybut on seeing me still  able  and in the force of youth at least of middle age he contracted his brow and seemed to ask me by his look what  I did basking here at home In the enthusiasm of his martial veneration which rises to every thing but idolatry he hath at his own expence erected in his garden little monumental ornaments to the memory of his favourite heroes BRITANNIA was on one side weeping over WOLFE and on the other the figure of PUBLIC TRANQUILITY offering the olivebranch to CUMBERLAND Not a warrior of any celebrity but had at least a bust a pedestal or an inscription And upon my taking notice of a vacant nich in the center of the garden the Major struck it with his cane and exclaimed In the name of Honour VERNON why wilt thou not give an old friend the opportunity to fill this gap of glory with  another  of the CAESARS I felt at this instant SOPHY a flush in my cheeks and as we returned together into his house which is in the taste of fortifications  to drink his Majesty's health I perceived the tear of repressed ambition descending and my old friend pronounced it a  drop of promise  I am my dear SOPHY Your own CAESAR VERNON  Mr  THORNTON  in Continuation  I WILL now suppose SEDLEY that thou hast read these letters Are they not indications of a mind busied in schemes superior to thine While Mr VERNON is anxious to serve his country thou art exerting thyself to disgrace it while he is desirous to obtain the consent of a beloved and beautiful wife to suffer his absence in consideration of his glory thou art CHESTERFIELDING it how thou mayst dishonour beauty without admitting the very ideas of love What measures are taken in consequence of these epistles thou shalt know in my next In the interim may CAESAR'S example fire thy imitation and if thou  wilt  copy mayst thou copy so worthy an original at least in the nobleness of his sentiments  Farewel  LETTER LXXVI SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  Before the Receipt of the above  I FIND it impossible to conquer the habits of loving and communicating to thee my sentiments There is a philtre in an old friendship that cannot easily be destroyed Pardon my rash sayings therefore Preach till thou art weary and only allow me the liberty of reposing with thee all my enterprizes  What course I am to take in the present crisis Heaven only can tell Such an accident has happened as totally confounds me In conformity to my promise  I dispatched HARRIET to the languishing pedant but she had scarce got as I understand five miles on her way when the cursed postilion willing to shew his dexterity according to their villainous custom by driving like a devil through the village at a short turn or rather angle in the road overturned the chaise fell himself from the saddle and set the horses agoing while the poor HARRIET was dragged along the earth with her body half out of the chaisewindow till a countryman caught the off horse by the bridle and put a stop to the career She was carried into a little dirtylooking inn almost speechless and as she informs me with an arm torn by the glass which was unfortunately drawn up scribbled an almost unintelligible line to request I would hasten to see her before she died The postboy brought me the note trembling like a leaf and white as a shirt protesting most  fervently that he could not help the accident I knew not what to do I hesitateddreaded the consequencewrote a hurried line to poor HORACE without feeling either the pen or papercalled for a taper without thinking that I wanted waxsent it to the post by the boyand then ordered my horses The cursed landlord who is ever alarmed at the sound of a hoof in the expectation of fresh prey now detected my disorder and set every wheel at work to find out the cause "He was sorely sorry to see me uneasy would do any thing in his power hoped nothing material was the matterCould he do any thinghe was concerned to see me in such confusionwould do a great deal to serve so worthy a gentleman  mahap  I was taken illmahap my friends  was  sick in LONDONmy wifemy auntmy uncle Some lawsuit  may be  had gone wrong or  sommut  or other was most  sartinly  the  matter" My servant came with my horses to the door and the persecutor began again"Good lack good lack what can be the  'casion  of this Was I going awayWas I obliged to leave BUXTON MARTHA where's the gentleman's little accountHow sorry he was again  In short THORNTON I was obliged to escape  him  and my rising rage by rushing into a little slip of ground behind his house where under pretence of picking a few pinks that straggled povertystruck about the beds I cast about what was to be done In this manner I argued with myself If I go to HARRIET the affair will certainly be suspected for how came I so interested in this lady's misfortune If I do  not  go it will be barbarousbut then I have sent to her husband and home is the best and fittest place for a sick womanUpon the whole I thought it not proper or political  to go and as to writing I dare not give way to my sentiments for a discovered letter is irrecoverable perdition Upon my return into the house I found the rascally landlord tampering for intelligence with the postboy who had come upon the saddlehorse with the tangled traces still about his backI had well nigh broke out again THOMAS who stays with me although married till I can suit myself looked as if he suspected the matterthe landlord muttered forth a million pities and talked of our being all mortal and liable to accidentsthe postboy said his horses were out as I saw all to pieces and his chaise shattered in the pannels  I could STANHOPE it no longer Curse your horses chaise and pannels all together said Iget out of my sight and leave me to myself a lady is dying and you are prating about your damn'd pannels  TOM take away the horsesYou postboy stop till I write a note to the lady to let her know that I have written to her husband  I would have gone in to write  The landlord again struck up "Had not the lady better come back to my house Sir The journey to Mr HOMESPUN'S will be too far in her present condition" Pray Mr WYNGOOD said I suffer me to do as I please The man was piqued at the  See CHESTERFIELD  slight  and I verily believe will never forgive me However I wrote a note to HARRIET to the following purport and ordered the postboy to carry it as fast as possible  To Mrs  HOMESPUN  Madam  I AM unfeignedly sorry at your misfortune the moment I became acquainted with it I sent to Mr HOMESPUN who will be with you no doubt the moment he is able to ride there I hope most sincerely no ill effects will ensue from this distressing accident and I have some little consolation in understanding by the messenger that an apothecary resides in the village where it happened and that the art of a surgeon is not necessary With the warmest wishes for your speedy recovery I am  Madam  Your most humble servant PHILIP SEDLEY  I had two reasons THORNTON for shewing this prior to my sending it to the landlord in the first place I wanted to regain his friendship that is you know according to my system his good word by an act of confidence and in the next as this was upon the whole a mysterious affair and I could not tell the issue of it such a letter written as thou perceivest it is even in the midst of hurry with a pen of policy might do me good should the matter be hereafter canvassed at the bath WYNGOOD being as I before told thee the greatest gossip of the country  By this time I conjecture my messenger has delivered the note Unluckily I have to sup this evening at the DELMORE'S Sir HENRY being never happy without me Very very unfit am I at present to figure or sustain myself in company for not to disguise matters with  you  I am not insensible  to this misfortune of poor HARRIET nor could I see the injury done to her bewitching form without a sigh But however I am equal to all events and must carry on with vigour what I have begun with spirit otherwise I should retreat with disgrace and for aught I can tell take refuge from the horrors of despair by the aid of a trigger Pray my dear THORNTON against these horrible resources  I am Yours PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER LXXVII SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  IF thou wert surprized at the contents of my last prepare ere thou perusest the present for fresh wonders I was just set down to the cardtable at the DELMORE'S to pass the interval betwixt the tea and the supper when THOMAS upon the full gallop and with tokens of terror in his countenance delivered me the inclosed billet which had it been delivered in the presence of the company would have betrayed me for ever to the eyes of this piercing family but luckily the footman came to say that my servant waited my orders Pray read the billet before thou goest any farther  The inclosed Billet To Mr  SEDLEY  Most inhuman SEDLEY  I HAVE ordered myself on the receipt of your letter to be taken out of my bed and brought hither in defiance of the Doctor and at the risque of my life chiefly indeed because I would see before the last event and once more kiss the hand of the still dear but most barbarous PHILIP SEDLEY I write in agony but am still  Your HARRIET HOMESPUN  It was with a difficulty equal to the struggles betwixt life and death that I supported myself from sinking under this intelligence I had however sufficient presence of mind to return to the company and make excuses with some degree of coherence after which I mounted the reeking horse and ordering TOM to follow me went upon the fullstretch to my lodgings At my entrance into the parlour I found HARRIET in a strong hysteric and upon her recovery we had her put into a warm bed She is perfectly  mangled  THORNTON her fine face is gashed with wounds and the landlady tells me that other parts of her person have sustained their share of bruises To mend the matter I have received a long epistle from FANNY MORTIMER which was delivered with as much peculiarity as thou wilt find in the sentiments After dinner the whole family rambled into the  garden and as I was passing near Mrs MORTIMER along the shade of a small shrubbery that affected to serpentine she with her own hand bade me look at that paper I folded it in my bosom and bowed and just as she desired no one perceived it I have not attempted to answer it nor can I shew myself decently till I have the reply in my pocket This cursed affair of HARRIET unfits me for adventure however I send you the letter and must think what is to be done HARRIET is I find by the landlady in a dozeI rather think agony closes the eye and that she is unable to speak The Doctor is preparing his plaisters and a Physician who attends the bath is sent for What measure can I possibly take with respect to HORACE and I am not without fears for myself 'Sdeath THORNTON is there never a case in point I must consult my AUTHOR Adieu  LETTER LXXVIII  Mrs  MORTIMER  to Mr  SEDLEY  Sir  AN address from me under my peculiar situation will no doubt alarm you but forms and ceremonies must all yield to irresistible exigences I find it necessary to the peace of my mind to write to you The accident Sir that brought us together at SCARBOROUGH when your visits to me were very frequent and as a single woman I confess not disagreeable is recollected with some anxiety You were then at some pains to convince me I had made an impression on your sensibility  and certain sentiments were interchanged which it would be at this period highly improper to repeat It may not be amiss however to observe that prior to your quitting SCARBOROUGH you did not omit exerting your utmost talents and they are not inconsiderable Mr SEDLEY to engage my heart How far you succeeded it is not  now  material to enquire Be that as it may my health hath been gradually upon the decline from that hour to this It is now some months since I gave my hand to Mr MORTIMER than whom there never lived a better character or a tenderer husband He was educated under the eye of my father who seemed so wrapt up in the ideas of making him still nearer to his family that as he thought proper to address me I could not deny to duty what possibly I should have refused to every thing else In a word Sir my worthy father's  heart was in the match and it is impossible for a child to disappoint the wishes of  such  a parent The softness delicacy and gentleness of Mr MORTIMER'S behaviour has ever been uniform and exact and although it has pleased Heaven to continue my indisposition and indeed rather to increase than abate it yet he has not suffered my languor to relax his animated assiduities but has acted both by day and by night the double part of nurse and husband Peculiarly unlucky do I account the destiny by which you and I Sir meet again not that I have the least traces of affection for your person being really attached to Mr MORTIMER by duty and upon principle At the same time Sir I cannot but own your presence gives me uneasiness and uneasiness of any kind I am not now equal to You have I see recommended yourself to my father more warmly than ever my sister thinks very  highly of you Mr MORTIMER is loud in your praises and even my mother who is not easily attracted speaks of you with ardour As my situation is sufficiently sacred to exclude every possible hope nay as I dare presume your own connexions have by this time led your inclinations into a more proper channel I will venture to talk to you with the freedom of a friend To speak plainly then Mr SEDLEY there is a point in which you may still oblige meit is this that you would enter as seldom into this house as is consistent with a resolution which I earnestly beg you will take of withdrawing yourself from this familyDo it leisurely but at all events let it be done Ah Mr SEDLEY pity the perturbation of an uneasy mind Before you came I could at least conceal agitation and submit to the silent depredations of my distemper Every tear I then shedevery  sigh that then stole from mewas attributed to the unavoidable risings and sinkings of a consumptive habit But within these few days I have had some conflicts and every one of them adds to my weakness to hidea something that preys upon my heart To account to you for this is needless If you have the least suggestion that it is occasioned by your appearance let it interest your humanityyour honouryour compassionin my cause and do not Mr SEDLEY render more exquisitely wretched the last hours of a fate at the best unenviable and not sustained without a sorrow that is hastening its object to the tomb Go then I conjure you Leave me to the protection of a generous familyof a dear sisterof a fond husband It is notI  feel  it is not possible that I should long live amongst them Let me not shew Mr MORTIMER that I gave myself to him as to the friend and  darling youth of my fatherLet not Alas Mr SEDLEYwhat have I said Pardon mepity meoblige meleave me As your stay at the bath cannot be of consequence as the floridness of your complexionthe lustre of your eyesthe ease in your airall assure me your pursuit is mere amusement I intreat you to change your routefix it at SCARBOROUGHBATH MARGATEany where so as you will but leave this place I look at you with anguishI know your rap at the doorI distinguish your stepand though I feel the improprietythe crime the shameof being disturbed I cannot bear itContrive therefore and that instantly to begin your task of dissolving the connexion here Permit me to enjoy the little serenity that a wastin  sickness admits The poor pittance of ease which that allows do not you destroy As I saw the intimacy betwixt you and my  family daily increasing nay as you have been almost constantly at this house for the last week I could contrive no other way of addressing you but by writing an honest explicit letter which I have now done with many interruptions both from pain fatigue and the fear of being seen but chance has favoured me and I have unbosomed the secret of my soul undiscovered Think not however that I mean to enter into a correspondence Take a week to withdraw with the elegance becoming your character during which time I will as hitherto endeavour to support myself as an acquaintance although it is sufficiently shocking that I should be  reduced  even to a moment's disguise If you are not disengaged from us by that period I have no other refuge than a constant retreat to my sick chamber whenever you visit us and if this should in the end occasion suspicion and the cruel  unconquerable prepossession I entertain be ever discovered you will remember that to  your  injustice must be imputed the consequences even though the best of parents should be made miserable the worthiest sister partake their anxiety and the kindest of husbands fall a victim to the apparent ingratitude of  FRANCES MORTIMER  LETTER LXXIX THORNTON  to  SEDLEY  GOD of Heaven SEDLEY what a wretch of adamant art thou The disaster of the poor HARRIET and the pleadings of the pathetic FANNY have almost exhausted the source of my tears

upon the spur of speed to LONDON and thy THORNTON But as I shall probably touch thee more by example than precept take the continuation of my transactions in the worthy Lieutenant's family and consider well a scene which may be held up in blessed contrast to  thine  Scarce had SOPHIA read her husband's letter but she wrote an answer of which I present you a faithful copy  To Lieutenant  VERNON  My dear ambitious CAESAR  THOUGH I am no friend to the devastations of war I am warmly so to the dignity of my husband's character nor can I bear to see his laurels withered by the childish and emasculating fears and delays of a wife Yes my dear CAESAR you areI feel that you areonly a disbanded Lieutenant I am not insensible to the reproach in that observation But whycruel VERNONwhy is our little fortune locked up so as to deny us the pleasure of making a purchase so infinitely to our credit May Heaven long keep you from the perils of battle but you are mistaken if you think there are not  some  women who can be tender without being weak Our sex is disgraced by the  general affectation of it We are flattered into the notion that we are prettiest in our delicate pretences and most lovely in distress But our minds are not all formed or cultured alike and for  my  part I had not married a soldier if I had not designed that he should sustain the duties of his station and you will recollect that Capt BLESSINGTON  my  father in point of martial prowess yields not the palm even to  yours  Mr THORNTON and I both wish your business may soon permit your return to the pleasures of SURRY and we both also concur to venerate the name of FRASER but whatever honours may be in store for my CEASAR may the nich of the Major be many many years unoccupied if it is kept sacred to the memory of my everdear Lieutenant VERNON Thus prays zealously  His affectionate wife SOPHIA VERNON  There SEDLEYthere's a womanthe intrepidity of a man blended with all the virtues and elegances of her sex and yet may I perish if I ever again attempt her destruction On the contrary I derive joy real joy from hearing her sing forth the praises of CAESAR I join in the panegyric I improve by her superior capacity and though all the Graces are in her train and she seems formed to every purpose of extacyhas black eyesan inviting shape an air of breeding and features perfectly symmetricalyet I can now be contented to admire her beauty and hear the sallies of her wit without a single endeavour to make her  pay for pleasing me  at the expence of her chastity  Adieu  P S  Act like a man and God prosper thee  LETTER LXXX SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  HORROR upon horrors THORNTON HORACE is come He arrived at midnight My letter found him in bed He hurried on his cloaths took his pad from the stable and hath travelled thirty miles through the rain to see his HARRIET I was up and musing in my chamber as he cameI unbarred the door he hugg'd methanked me kissed mekneeled down to me and with an air and look of distraction desired to be directed to his wife I shewed him her chamber and let the consequence be what it will I must stand it out  As to FANNY MORTIMER not the whole congregated world should save her from my embraces Oh earth and heaven THORNTON she is the most attracting form that ever died a death of gentleness Then she is such a contrast to the fullformed HARRIETso slim so soft of spiritan eye so borne down by modesty to the earthher eyelashes so silken so curvedthe bow of the heavens cannot match the archings of her browher hair is so glossyso abundant such a luxury in its various foldsher very languors are deliciousand as she put the letter into my hand her palm struck mine upon the tremblethe murmur of love was in the sigh that  then  broke from her bosom and the teeth through which it passed were purer than snow  Away then with melancholy ideas I pity HARRIET but I mustI  will  possess FANNY MORTIMER though I were to die in the effort  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER LXXXI  The Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  My dear Madam  OUR poor HARRIET is sorely hurtbut she received me kindly the tear that she let fall upon my hand I have suffered to dry without wiping it away The physician is to be here tomorrow and then you shall know more HARRIET asked me several times if I was wellI told her I was and yet Heaven knows I am in a fever at this moment for I have not been able to  close my eyes and I was wetted through the shirt in my journey My wife seems to have chiefly suffered in the face and arms I therefore hope the less danger  Adieu I am your real friend HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER LXXXII  Miss  DELIA DELMORE  to Lady  LUCY SAXBY  EVERY moment in the day affords some fresh and beautiful instance of my noble father's wisdom and affection About an hour after tea this evening while Sir HENRY was enjoying his serene summerwalk as he calls it WILLIAM brought a pencil'd card and delivered it to me It was to advise with  him  Sir HENRY about some concerns essential to the general welfare Even my little brother and sister Charles and Caroline who are down with us were mentioned in this invitation the card requested the company of all the family adding that as  the evening was delightful his mind composed and nobody but ourselves at present in the house he much desired that we might all have our share in the general serenity How prettily my dear LUCY how persuasively this exalted parent proposes as a pleasure what his authority might command as a duty But it is among the number of his excellent maxims that none but froward spirits do well with compulsion and that a frank and ingenuous tenderness hath in it equal weight and satisfaction  The conversation past in the garden under the shade of hawthorns laurels and filberts there is a white bench under it and a sort of natural arching bowerfashion made by the mixture of thick leaves and branches interwoven above Hither we came in obedience to the summons a group of relations loving and  beloved FANNY who had been amusing herself with the pen not having had strength for the pleasures of writing for some time came forward delicate as angel meekness with her young brother in one hand and her little sister in the other VENUS with two of her attendant Graces could not be more lovely even though the distress of illheath threw somewhat of languor into her air but then it was a languor so soft and a distress so gentle that it only served the more to  feminize  if you'll allow the word and to recommend her to the spectator as a more pathetic interesting figure  Sir HENRY was at first sitting somewhat pensively with an opened letter in his handmy mother by his side leaning her arm on one of the corners of the bench and reposing her cheek within her handthe true posture of meditation  They both rose at our approach Mr MORTIMER and I went up first then FANNY and her twin cherubs we were a little alarmed but this was soon dissipated by Sir HENRY who seating us all on the bench drew a green gardenchair from an adjoining shade placing himself opposite to us and with a smile of ineffable benignity in which the parent and the friend shone beautifully blended he paid each of us a varied compliment on our obedience to his wishes and addressed us to this effect  "I have requested your company my dear and worthy children to engage your filial attention on several of the most important events of human life I have indeed for some time had a design to summon you together on this subject but care company and amusement have thrown their attractions or interruptions hitherto  in the way of my wishes I have however fixt upon this evening of leisure to deliver to you the secrets of my heart and in mine are included those of the best of wives and tenderest of mothers"  Lady DELMORE drew her spread fingers across her face and Sir HENRY repeating his panegyric went on  "I am happy my dear relatives to tell you in the first placeand let that serve as an encouragement to youthat I can look back upon a life of more than threescore years with a tranquility of retrospect at the same time sincere christian and philosophic The serenity of my soul is in no degree wounded by the criticism with which I review its conduct through the perilous voyage of my life in which by the care of Heaven I have escaped those quicksands that endanger our youth  and those rocks which alarm us in age But that which I account far the richest indulgence of Providence is that dear prospect which I now behold in the persons of this beauteous circlea circle filled with the pledges of this generous creature's invariable fidelity and the testimonies of my continent attachment to excellence so distinguished"  My mother rose LUCY gave her hand to Sir HENRY looked at him a moment looked at him blooming even in age sighed softly and returned to her seat  Sir HENRY proceeded  "The season of infancy is past with most of you and its pleasures are succeeded by reflections of a higher nature Even this sweet pair  here he pointed to my young brother and sister  are at the age  of distinguishing and the rest are mature The blossoms of youth promise a generous fruitage You DELIA have not yet been rewarded by the tenderness of such a man as my MORTIMER yet the colour of your life will depend on the exchange of your name Your mother's expectations like mine are sanguine and extensive our eyes are turned on your every action We hope to see you all the supports of our declining age our sun is about to set and we wish its departure may be gilded by your virtues and indulgences  "The father of a family is at once a sublime and venerable character My full heart dilates as I see myself encompassed by these charming portraits of ourselves"  Here Lady DELMORE melted into tears of transport but endeavoured to conceal them  "I can form to myself continued my father no ideas beyond it nor many equal Our family is at present the seat of integrity unanimity and mutual confidence Our pleasures are reflected upon each other and we reciprocally give and receive inimitable complacence Yet we must be alarmed for those we love Though the tenour of your conduct and the gratitude of your tempers make us less fearful of deviation and though the maxims we have ever been industrious to inculcate make us more secure and inapprehensive yet certain tremors will inevitably touch the bosom of a parent be not displeased therefore my children if I give you a few general precepts for your establishment and adoption They come sanctified to you with the venerable imprimatur of more than fifty years experience The maxims which are necessary to regulate an  ingenuous mind are neither multiplied nor intricate The very cornerstone of a great character is a clear conscience if you feel well you will act well and if you do not all the talents in the world will only serve to torment you Never wear a mask before your motives but when it is absolutely necessary to the felicity of life such as deceiving or rather bewitching the unprincipled into virtue some tempers cannot bear the plain Truth she is too aweful for them be it then in such particular cases your parts to lead them to her sacred temple by the most pleasing pathsAlleviate the apparent ruggedness and length of the way by such meanders as though they seem to deviate may assuredly bring you by the fairest prospects to the shrine of the GoddessI have no objection to your adorning yourselves with all the attractions of exterior such I mean  as are reflected upon the character from dignity of manner persuasion of voice splendor of address and elegance of air  Where virtue is these are most virtuous  They will act like magic and make the innocence both of your sentiment and example perfectly irresistible and I beseech you to exert them in the cause of that truth and sobriety of heart I have recommendedMake use of them to conciliate differences to inspirit society to embellish conversation to soften the harshness of dispute to animate attention to please to instruct to entertain To all these purposes they will be excellent and ornamental But beware of what a licentious and artful indulgence of them may possibly lead tobeware of DUPLICITY of  that  duplicity which so accoutered its destructive sword sheathed in politenessits heart shielded by the impenetrable  mail of gilded hypocrisyis equal to the siege of a city and might do more real  mischief  than all the efforts of a legion of avowed villanies Of all earthly things therefore most detest what is most to be dreaded the system of a wellbred highpolished elegant deceiver no eye can see him no understanding detect him no policy escape him He comes in the form of a Seraph and those who are themselves honest cannot imagine that he is a Syren  "At your time of life it is hard extremely hard to master the predominant inclination yet virtuous exercise will habituate the soul to the practice of uniform honour To you DELIA I am now going to speak more particularlyThere is a passion which rightly directed is the source of every noble and genuine greatness FANNY and Mr MORTIMER I trust are not insensible  to it May it affect you DELIA in the manner it has affected your motherthis excellent woman whose regard for me was founded on principles that sustain the first of connections in its due elevation and adorn the heart by the dictate of which the hand is presented with all that can give either spirit elegance or real transport to conjugal engagements  "Unadulterated as yet by the smallest commerce with dexterous dissimulation pardon my alarms lest your innocence and simplicity should be the means of your misfortuneThat DISSIMULATION which under the fair disguise of attracting elegance led forward by the Graces cannot be detected even at noonday is for ever on the watch and I know nothing so dangerous as yielding too easily to the tenderness of a newborn passion Do not however  mistake me my system is not rigid it is not inconsistent with the natural feelings of a delicate disposition I have given FANNY to one in whose education and culture I myself had a share and that may shew you DELIA that I am no foe to the feelings of Love"  Here a sigh heaved gently the bosom of FANNYI dare presume it was the sigh of love Lady LUCY  "I wish continued Sir HENRY to see each of my children a wife or a husband or a parent and at the head of an infant society I wish DELIA to have the man of her heartPerhaps she has lately seen that manPerhaps the accomplished Mr SEDLEY"  In this place FANNY began to complain she sat too longand I was glad of the  interruption for you can't imagine how my cheek began to crimson certainly  you  was talking of me ororor what was it LUCY  Sir HENRY went on  "I will not DELIA distress you I see nothing at present objectible I will not enquire into this matter till you judge it for your happiness to consult me and till then particular enquiries would be prematureperhaps improperOnly be circumspect look well at the ground before you build on it the foundation of your happiness or misery To adopt the language of SHAKESPEARE "Wear your eye thus" neither vacant nor suspicious In any case of emergency while we live though that cannot in common course of terrestrial decays be now long honour me or your mother with your confidence  and when we are no more I beg all of you will trust to the affection of this worthy young man our dear MORTIMER who having seen more of life and the transactions of men is the better able to promote happiness and avert misery With these sentiments I trust you to your understandings virtues and tempers with these precepts which I have a particular reason now to urge I trust you to discretion oeconomy and fairdealing If I have been tedious consider I am an old man if I have dealt in repetitions or if I have digressedconsider I am a father Go then my children cherish each other avoid the path of Deceit walk steadily in the road of Truth even though the roses may not always be in bloom satisfy the feelings of your own conscience be mercifulbe moderate and be happy"  As he ended my dear Lady LUCY he rose while the big paternal tear was in his eye embraced us round and taking my mother by the hand walked with her arm in arm into the house  Oh my friend had ever children such parents My heart is at this time so full of gratitude wonder and the daughter that I can only add the esteemed name of  Your happy and highlyhonoured DELIA DELMORE  LETTER LXXXIII THORNTON  to  SEDLEY  Before the Receipt of  SEDLEY  'S last  AS thou hast not taken notice of any parts of my letters relating to the family of Mr VERNON I am in hopes thou art not quite unmoved by the generous virtues that are reciprocated between the worthiest pair I ever knew and who have made me quite in love with matrimony Yes SEDLEY do not startI say sober matrimony and could I get a certain young lady in the mind who is now a visitant to Mrs VERNON and just arrived I believe I should enter into the holy estate without hesitation for I begin to believe  whatever thy Preceptor may say that wedded love is after all the most elevated of human connections nay I have had several reasons since my residence here to adopt the language of the poet and pronounce that state the most delightful wherein  Thought meets thought ere from the lips it part  And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart  Never were souls more exactly in unison than those of the VERNONS I presentfor your emulationanother instance of it Upon my unfolding the Lieutenant's design to his lady she dispatched a letter into Sussex which produced the following reply  Lieutenant  VERNON  to his  LADY  Most dear SOPHIA  THAT you was superior to the feebleness of the modish female who affects to lisp to shudder at the shower and tremble at the breeze I knew before but that your soul was so nicely attuned to the pains and pleasures of mine I was not so aware of till the receipt of your last kind favour  You will spare me to your King you will lend him my services against the foes of Britain noble woman generous wife I am again at Major FRASER'S in my way home and upon my arrival at our peaceful  villa I will pay you my warmest acknowledgments by my embraces I put your letter with a sparkling eye into the hand of my old friend he read it and burst forth into extacies peculiar to the manly violence of his nature "'Sdeath VERNON said he ten such wives as thine would restore the female character from the ignominy of the rest of the sex Such were the Spartan such were the Roman women I do not wish our wives to fight Lieutenant I do not wish them to wield the battleax nor to eject the bomb but in the name of honour let them suffer their husbands to behave like men and permit those who wear beards to deserve them I love softness VERNON and consider it as the female characteristic but still I would have some distinction made betwixt women and children exclusive of the mere difference of bodily size and I do declare to thee Lieutenant though I  have seen many women that I could have liked some that I could love yet I never dared venture upon matrimony lest my wife should stand betwixt me and my duty as a soldier but could I like thee have met with a SOPHIA I had long since taken to myself a bravespirited wench who should have spread the triumphal roses under my feet and wove her garland of welcome against my return But you are the happy hero you are more than a general in the affections of SOPHIA Go on then embark exert yourself to merit so illustrious a girl fail not I charge you to visit me with SOPHY under your arm on your coming again to the country you have honoured" I was preparing to give him the farewel embrace but he held me by the hand and surveying his figure in a glass that was opposite shook his head and burst into tears "Thou seest said he still looking  in the mirror I do not counterfeit my best arm and my most serviceable leg have left me my soul wishes for the field but my bodythis useless load of an old fellow of whom the half is timberwould but shame the troops and disgrace his Majesty" Then turning to the other end of the room he took from the mantlepiece a sword cautiously guarded from the rust by a scarlet case"Therecontinued the Major after he had taken it from the coveringthere VERNON is the blade that attended me in all my fortunes for more than thirty years examine ittake notice of the marks of prowess it is no maiden I'll assure thee  A better never did a belt sustain  Upon a soldier's thigh  Take it Lieutenant The hand which used to manage it is gone and with it the occupation of poor FRASER 'tis a shame that so excellent a friend should be  converted into a piece of lazy houshold furniture Take it then I say and when thou art in the front of the battle remember whose token thou hast in hand and do it justice"  There are other traits my dear SOPHIA of this brave invalid's character which I shall reserve for the opportunity of domestic endearment As to your saying that you see less beauty and smell less fragrance in the flowers of our garden since my absence and then artfully urging that as a reason why  you  should accompany me to America makes me pleased with the compliment though I am not convinced by the argument The Colonies are now in too much confusion to afford a lady accommodation and your residence would be with me always precarious and for the most part unfit for you The scene of bloodshed would be  too near your eye and the attention I should pay to you would make me less attentive to my own professional advantages Satisfy yourself therefore with the friendship of the good Mr THORNTON with the exactest correspondence and with the unalterable love of  Your tender CAESAR VERNON  P S  I am glad you are at last joined by Miss SIDNEY Tell her I salute her  THORNTON  in Continuation  There SEDLEY is thou seest fresh reason to animate thy amendments But the postman brings me a packet I perceive it is superscribed by thy character and imprest by thy seal Haply I shall find by the contents that thy reformation is begun In this hope I break thy wax and bid thee farewel  LETTER LXXXIV SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  THORNTON give me joy My insinuations have extorted from FANNY "her slow leave" and as soon as I can contrive an interview with her I am to have it Hear by what a display of my art I won her consent to see me alone In reply to her epistlethat which I sent theeI wrotethough I like not trusting myself to the  mercy  of ink and paper another in which I exerted and exhausted all the delicacy of dissembled passion I struck the string most likely to work upon a woman in her situation and as a proof of my address and eloquence I tell thee again that I prevailedFor once she will see me Read her card  Mrs  MORTIMER  to Mr  SEDLEY  FOR once as you urge it with such vehemence and as you promise to quit BUXTON immediately afterwards I  will  see you When you see an opportunity either in the garden or elsewhere you may employ it in communicating what you tell me is of so much consequence to my fame and felicity  F M  Now then THORNTON must I call to my aid DORMER'S "unobserved observation" and banish all but the present object from my thoughts now must I discover "the true mark of a superior genius" and shew "a steady undissipated attention" till I have ultimately succeeded in this great glorious particularNothing shall seduce me a single moment from  'Sdeath THORNTON the passingbell tollsSurely HARRIET is not deadNo matterI will notdare not enquire I will command myself this once and when this scheme is compleated I care not how soon I descend to ELYSIUM and to CHESTERFIELD  PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER LXXXV  The Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  OH Mrs LA MOTTE the measure of my miseries is not compleated I have every thing to apprehend from both the looks and words of the physician Just as he last entered she called out without looking at him that he was the cruellest of men and then upon drawing the curtains begged his pardon and said she was mistaken I have not even yet had my cloaths offI can eat nothing and when I drink it is only to allay the thirstings of a slow fever that is still lurking about me Mr SEDLEY came yesterday kindly to enquire and just as he had  saidWell my good Mr HOMESPUN and how does our poor HARRIET now she screamed out with inconceivable violencebade us shut the door and then remained weeping and fainting alternately for above an hour My fate is really a hard one Mrs LA MOTTE but my conscience is void of offence and the wisdom of the ALMIGHTY shall not even now he questioned by  HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER LXXXVI  Miss  DELIA DELMORE  to Lady  LUCY SAXBY  I CONFESS it LUCYhe HAS pleased me and I am above concealing from my friend that I admire his  manner  even more than his person His words his looks his motions are truly irresistible and if you knew half the noble things he hath done since he came to the bath you would the less wonder at my being caught I will only mention to you one or two points of his conduct which will help you by such specimens to conjecture the rest His servant had played the libertine with an innocent wench who depended upon the bounty of the bathers  for her attendance at the pump and well the fellow seduced her the poor deluded wretch lost her virtue and her means of livelihood at the same time Common masters would have cuffed the footman and called the injured girl a simpleton Mr SEDLEY insisted upon the deceiver's marrying the deceived the ceremony has actually been celebrated and it is said not by him for he never speaks of himselfthat he designs to see them well settled before he leaves BUXTON  There is you must knowa lady who on her return from the bath to her house was hurt by the overturning of a carriage and the husband who is a worthy clergyman would have been quite distracted had it not been for the cares tendernesses and attention of this obliging man who hath the art of propitiating everybody to him and making everybody  around him happy by those nice and minute yet truly engaging offices which being in general considered as unimportant though in reality I find they are but too pleasing are too often neglected He is now very frequently in our family and I rejoice to see him so much in the confidence and good graces of my father mother and brother As to poor dear FANNY she seldom talks when she can avoid it and one may see Mr SEDLEY'S good breeding and even the feelings of his heart in the manner with which he adapts himself to the person he addresses when his sentiments are directed to Sir HENRY they are acute correct classical penetrating learned when to my brother they are elegant noble dignified and animating when to my mother they are grave condescending cautious when to my sister gentle in an undertone of voice softened as it  were to the situation of a sick person and that person a woman his subjects to FANNY are such as might soothe a spirit much nearer its end than I hope that dear creature is He colours beautifully the ideas of hope he talks of returning health he paints to her imagination and he gives such touches to the scene of her expected recovery that our dear invalid smiles when she is too exhausted to speak and her husband thanks him with overflowing eyes for the entertainment and ease he hath produced to Mrs MORTIMORE In short LUCY he is a divine fellow and I know not what will be the consequence of my trip to BUXTON Let what will be the event  I am always your DELIA DELMORE  P S  I had almost forgot to tell you that I am half teazed to death with the surfeiting fine sayings of a beau who hath offered me knickknacks without number and has made serious and tempting overtures to my father So that you see SEDLEY has got a rival Oh heavens that Providence should  into the same world  send two creatures so uniformly different  Adieu  LETTER LXXXVII SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  THE Gods have been auspicious The interview is past and the stratagem by which it was obtained is worthy of myself Thou must understand that the sister of FANNYthe lady I mean with the pastoral appellation Miss DELIA DELMOREis such an object as cannot possibly be past over by the eye of a man who is taught to ANNIHILATE THE VERY IDEA OF CRIMINALITY and is only intent upon the possession of as much beauty without the vulgar consideration of "to whom related or by whom begot" as he can possibly find and the  more  to be found in  one  family the better so as that secrecy which saves  all mischief can be procured This DELIA I say THORNTON being in the maiden state and to all intents and purposes in a marriageable situation must be addressed in the way of wedlock To this end I have so managed the point as to make one sister aid me in a design upon the other while in the mean time I have so contrived it that  both  shall be plotting their own personal pleasure nay I will make even the husband father mother and the very coxcomb I before told thee of who is my rival the ostensible puppets on this occasion while I in the supremacy of my wit and pushed forward by my great Preceptor will make the whole family subservient to the gratification of thy  PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER LXXXVIII THORNTON  to  SEDLEY  THY letter this moment come to hand convinces me of my mistake in supposing thou wert to be wrought upon by scenes of tenderness and generosity and proves that it is not in the language and good deeds of either man or woman to turn thy heart That Janus of an Earl has I see enfolded himself round thee his maxims have penetrated into thy very marrow Nay thou even goest beyond him he did but point at the benefits of duplicity in a private letter at least not by his  consent  made public but thou art duplicity itself Thou with an insidiousness  unparalleled engravest his horrid precepts on thine heart enterest the temple of domestic joy and under the appearance of an angel while the cloven foot of the fiend is delicately concealed art in sober truth could thy real form be seen the very demon of destruction Call not thyself  my  SEDLEYI own thee not Thou art the Devil's SEDLEY and I begin to shudder that I am connected with such a monster Yet I beseech thee once again in the still serene but pathetic voice of friendshipI beseech thee to desist Bring not the grey hairs of the venerable DELMORE'S to the grave Pollute not the weak defenceless FANNY catch not in thy treacherous toils the heart of DELIA who deserves a better fate Hasten I conjure thee to the metropolis There thy appetite for women may have its full play Our streets are crowded with  chastity destroyed beauty in ruins and simplicity seduced Dissipate at least with less mischief part of thy large fortune upon these From thy present pursuits I again repeat it thou canst gain nothing but infamy and if I could but transfer to thee my feelings thou wouldst hug them to thy heart for ever and discard all others with horror I have the happiness to please the visitor of Mrs VERNON the charming ARAMINTA SIDNEY she is the friend of FANNY MORTIMER they correspond she describes her as thou hast doneOh for GOD'S sake SEDLEYdo not harm  her  do not push thy cruelties to the dishonour disgraceand very probably the death ofa sick woman Mr VERNON is returned the affection the happiness of this pair might soften a panther into tenderness and subdue the veriest rake into continence No wonder it hath  touched the gentle bosom of ARAMINTA I find a rapture in her smiles I anticipate every change of her countenance I am so far from desiring to ruin her reputation that I tremble as I approach her I have not assurance enough to kiss her beautiful lips the slightest touch of her hand disorders me I detect myself looking at her and withdraw my eyes for fear of offending I am a very young man Mr SEDLEY and thou and CHESTERFIELD with your united councils had nearly led me to everything odious but I saw the precipice time enough to escape it the society of virtuous people the friendship of the Lieutenant and his lady the esteemand oh that I might be allowed to saythe love the pure love of ARAMINTAwill I hope again restore me to what I formerly was As to your secrets SEDLEY I shall not betray them  and you will judge how true I must be to the point of confidence when I dare not violate it even though by so pious a treachery I could probably save a noble family and

 THE last hope is extinguished and I can only hold the pen to tell you that my wife isin Heaven and that the last words which came from her quivering lips convinced me there is a wretch somewhere upon earth to whom I am indebted for her death I can say no more  HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER XCVI  Miss  DELIA DELMORE  to Lady  LUCY SAXBY  WHAT a dreadful change my dear LUCY since I last wrote to you There is an unusual degree of uneasiness on the countenances of my everhonoured parents my brother Mr MORTIMER is pensive FANNY was seized with an hysterical disorder while her husband was communicating to me the discourse that passed between him and Mr SEDLEY who has never been at our house since Mrs MORTIMER it seems knew not that Mr SEDLEY had interested her husband in the declaration made by that medium to me she remains exceedingly ill has actually  refused to suffer Mr MORTIMER to sleep with her says she has strong reasons for it which he shall know at a proper time At our coming into the drawingroom after we were summoned to her assistance by SEDLEY who in his confusion and hurry to fetch us ran down our long garden unbraced and without his hat we found the poor dear creature just recovering from a swoon her eyes closedher teeth shuther clenched hands locked in each otherand her dress in the utmost disorder I suppose from the violent changes of posture occasioned by the fits I have no heart now Lady LUCY to talk of my own affairs and yet as you have a right to know every thing that concerns me I just send you a sketch of my brother's conversation in the summerhouse previous to these alarming circumstances My almost constant attendance on my sister will not permit me to transcribe it fair and  you must be contented with a loose paper on which I have been able to scribble only at intervals  The Paper inclosing Mr  MORTIMER  'S Address to his Sister upon Mr  SEDLEY  'S Subject  MR MORTIMER having led me by the hand through the garden into the summerhouse began as usual with a pretty compliment told me that he found I had already done executionthat I had made a wound which all the waters of BUXTON were not able to cure and then proceeded you know LUCY what an able advocate he is to open the design of his calling me aside I will own to you said he my dear DELIA that I summon your attention in behalf of Mr SEDLEY but I will as nearly as I am able recollect his own  words and without the least endeavour to sway you leave the result to your own determination I lately had a particular conversation with Mr SEDLEY wherein he addressed me to the best of my remembrance as follows  "The motive of this visit Mr MORTIMER is in confidence to enquire of you from whom I have reason to believe she conceals nothing whether your sister DELIA is under any present engagement of heart or in the least respect partial to any one in the disposal of her affections for I should shudder to be the cause of even a negative pain to so amiable a woman and I forebore to ask this question of Sir HENRY lest that regard which he is pleased to entertain of me might incline him to something that might be contradictory to the private prospects of his daughter I know Mr MORTIMER the fraternal  affection your sister bears you and I am no stranger young as I am in your acquaintance to the allsouled intimacy subsisting between you as happy relations hence I imagined it more for the general peace to direct myself to you rather than to any other for as my enquiries are answered by  you  Mr MORTIMER I will either bury my ambitious wishes in my own and your bosom or should they meet an encouraging reply I will proceed to take such measures as seem to you most conducive to the happiness I aspire to"  Here DELIA he paused a little and then with inimitable grace pursued his overtures  "Although Mr MORTIMERsaid he I have had of late often the honour of Sir HENRY'S company whose nearest secrets of heart I am beginning to sh  re  I never found that he had any view of uniting Miss DELMORE to any particular family But why do I talk thus Sir HENRY spurns the bare idea of compulsitory connections and his noble nature can never stoop to barter the felicity of a child to interested prospects And yet Sir may it not be reasonably apprehended that a soul so delicatea heart so susceptiblefeelings so fineand a bosom so alive to every nicer alarm as Miss DELMORE'S may have made some wise and favourite choice of her own If so tell me of it frankly and I promise dear MORTIMERto join you in promoting rather than opposing the happiness she hopes for After what I have now said you will be quite explicit ingenuous and unreserved"  He waited my reply his fine eyes shone with expectation I told him that I  believed my sister DELIA had not yet amongst the various pretensions made to her hand seen the object she could approve in the intimate light he alluded to that I had often heard her express a proper regard to the excellences manners and address of Mr SEDLEY that as a very young friend introduced into the family by the hand of so revered and sagacious a father she had an elegant opinion of his merit and that though I had not observed the least intimation of her entertaining any sensibility of  heart  as to his person here DELIA he bowed and blushed yet that be not displeased DELIA I knew her naturally soft sensible and a nice distinguisher of superior endowments I concluded with saying that for the short time I could boast the honour of his acquaintance I knew none more likely to inspire Miss DELMORE and that as a proof of my good wishes I  would take the opportunity given me of Sir HENRY and Lady DELMORE'S eveningride from which I would excuse us young folks to inform you of the conversation previous to any farther procedure  His cheeks coloured to their full bloom and you know what a complexion he has DELIA at this proposal he begged with great delicacy that till I was preacquainted with your proposals wishes and views I would preserve the whole matter a secret not only from your mother and Sir HENRY but even from my wife the angelic Mrs MORTIMER as he was pleased to call her adding that he could not bear to occasion by an illtimed petition one moment's uneasiness in a family so harmonized innocent and affectionate as Sir HENRY DELMORE'S and that rather than be cruelly instrumental in the subversion of this although his heart was in the  cause he would stifle the pleadings of it to eternityI easily prevailed DELIA on Sir HENRY and your mother to excuse us and as soon as their chariot rolled from the door I took Mr SEDLEY by the arm and told him I was going to be his advocate He pressed my hand and in a whisper said he would have the honour to keep Mrs MORTIMER company in the saloon while I pleaded for him in the summerhouse  And now my dear DELIA continued my brother may I not congratulate you on the conquest of a man who if there is any faith in the fairest appearances is equally adorned in mind and body and who will I dare say instantly proceed to acquaint us with his circumstances and fortunes if he receives your sanction to be more explicit I must own I was never so truly attracted by any man and he really seems  born for an alliance with a woman as enchanting as himself Tell me trulytell me like a sisterDid you ever see so manly yet so decorated an addresssuch splendid sentimentsso elevated an air or Did you ever before meet with any gentleman so easy or so engaging in that sort of behaviour which is the result of a brilliant capacity ornamented breeding and unaffected complaisance  When you have read the inclosed LUCY give me the sentiment of your heart upon it for my own part flattering as it is I am too disordered and too much interested in the sudden gloom that hangs over our house to find satisfaction in any thing Yet I am always  Your DELIA DELMORE  LETTER XCVII  The Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  I AM obliged my good friend to summon not philosophy only but all the force of christianity to my aid and even that sustains itself with difficulty against the agitated powers of Nature My child is scarce cold in the earth my wise is tomorrow

virtues and always protect the consecrated spot which she occupies from all insult and sacrilegious indecency Nay my friend I will do more than this the child that I trusted but on Tuesday last to the tomb shall be raised again from the earth Little did I think the commands of my wife would be so soon necessary to be obeyed but her dying words shall not be forgotten The mother and the sonfor ah Mrs

the agony of my solitude That this is an uncommon proceeding I am not to be told but it is nevertheless consistent with MY notions of piety tenderness and duty and shall be done  I am obliged to lay down the pen but will not fold up my letter for though I shall be with you some time tomorrow nightscarcely till the middle of itI know I shall be incapable of relating to you what yet you will be

she desired the nurse to withdraw and taking me gently by the hand she looked at me for some time was almost drowned with her tears and hid her face within the pillow Then having somewhat relieved herself she rose again upon her arm and with a voice scarcely audible but pierceingly tender she addressed me thus  Oh my best HORACE I have injured thee I die a victim to the arts of the seducer a

to its Creator and she expired upon my cheek  Oh Mrs LA MOTTE that I could find the seducer Oh that I could discover the dark complotter of all this mischief Clergyman as I am I would make him feel

THORNTON  to  SEDLEY  Sir  I HAVE changed my condition and by so doing enlarged the circle of my felicity The chaste and honourable connection I have now made with the sacred and rational pursuits attending it render it very improper for me to hold farther correspondence with a man who professes to seduce the wife and may very probably one time or another  throw from his guard  even one who is armed against him by a knowledge of the basest system that ever was adopted  I only write this to acquaint you that it is the last letter you will ever receive from  Sir  Your most humble servant

 LUCY SAXBY  to Miss  DELIA DELMORE  HOW shall I be able to write a proper answer to so interesting a letter as your last in which two subjects so immediately opposite are touched upon As to poor Mrs MORTIMER'S health I anxiously hope she is by this time again restored to a more tolerable degree of it and yet how much are you all to be pitied in being necessarily made the spectators of a disposition so full of fears hopes wishes and apprehensions But as JOSEPH says "I dreamed a dream last night" and I shall relate it to my DELIA my fair oracle for interpretation Methought  I was on a

of whose life depends the felicity of mineLead me my sister to the Angel of HEALTH and I will kneel down and worship him  If that is the purport of your errand to Elysium I fear you are come here in vain  said CLARISSA  there can be no partialities and yon old greyheaded frowning personage you see with a scythe in his right hand would be very angry  if he was but to imagine what you want Death is above a bribe sister you may depend on it  At this instant I beheld a most beautiful cherub with golden plumage expanded fluttering over my head and alight by the side of meI trembled and bowed "Stranger" said the celestial figure  I know your businessput the name of your friend into that little latticeit leads to the palace of the Angel of PITYapproach reverently    Soon after I had obeyed these commands a door opened out of which came the most elegant appearance of the female sex that can possibly be imagined and with her a second form whose face was shaded by a snowy veil"Mortal" said the first splendid figure  the prayer of the affectionate shall not be offered in vain  thy friend shall live and lo here she is in the bloom of beauty and in the height of health  Saying this the veil was thrown aside and in the second form I immediately recognized the features of FANNY more animated and animating than ever I ran to embrace the sister of my friend but the Angel of PITY interposed and after bidding me depart in peace she waved a golden wand and then the different emotions occasioned by the vision awaked me  And yet DELIA I am persuaded this dream will be propitious How truly happy shall I be if you send me word that I have made a trip to Elysium to some purpose Nor will I at any rate suffer you to call me superstitious for the thing is very probable surely in recovering such a woman where such a family and such a husband are concerned the Angels of PITY and HEALTH may very  properly be interested I will not excuse you if you do not acquaint me with the success of my dream immediately  As to the conduct and conversation of Mr SEDLEY in the summerhouse I cannot but admire his address and ingenuity His making a confident of your brother was such a stroke of policy as shews him to be no ordinary lover and I can see from the delicate turn of his compliments and his management of those nameless delicacies which though called minute are amongst the points of importance that he is no novice in those mattersYou ask for my sentiments upon the subject What can I sayHave you not sent me the most amiable specimen of his attachment Was not this attachment discovered in a mode peculiar to the elegance of his characterHas he not personmannerfortunewitsenseDo you not know what  a complexion he has my dear when he blushesHas he not by your own confession the most decorated addressthe most splendid sentimentsthe most elevated air and Is it not the opinion of your brother that he never met with any gentleman  so easy or so engaging in that sort of behaviour which is the result of a brilliant capacity ornamented breeding and unaffected complaisance    Thus recommended then my dear on all sides how is it possible that my sentiments should not be greatly in his favour How is it possible that I should not wish to alter the superscription of my letters and direct them for Mrs SEDLEY  After all suppose I was to  change  my note you ask me for my sentiments suppose you see them in the following letter  To Miss  DELMORE  Dear DELIA  I OBEY your desire in regard to the offers of Mr SEDLEY and here send you the secret of my heart upon them  In the first place I would have you to consider men are generally false and can assume any shape that forwards and facilitates their purpose  In the next place you are most likely so partial to him that you call those actions elegant which are only ordinary and his manners which are in your eye so enchanting may only be a pretty method he has got of playing upon the surface of common subjects just to gain his ends after which he will perhaps become as insipid or as impertinent as the fop whom  you in your former letters have ridiculed Ten to one but this polite lover will be a very rude husband and when the magic of the marriagecircle is drawn in his favour alas poor lady wise how will thine eyes be open to the delusionPutting all these points together therefore my advice is fairly thisforbid him your house banish him from your companyblot him from your memory and to cut the matter short have nothing more to say to him These are the councils of your  LUCY SAXBY  Should I send this laconic epistle formally signed and sealed what would be the consequenceMethinks I see the whole scene The angry DELIA has finished the letter and lays it downshe hems twice or thrice attempting but in vain to swallow the  affront  Surely says she beautifully bridling surely Lady SAXBY  might have softened the matter a little she is very explicitbut how should she be a judge of a man she never sawI am not much delighted with her letter I can tell her thatShe believes all men are alikeWhat does she compare the divine SEDLEY to that atom of a fop that "bug with gilded wings" Upon my word a smart comparisonvery agreeable trulyI'll drop my correspondence with her censorious Ladyship however  Ah DELIA DELIA have I not shewn off the sex faithfullyDo I not know what agreeable inconsistencies we are in loveaffairs How ready we are all to ask the advice of another when we are predetermined to take our own Now are you not my dear correspondent are you not a little hypocrite Have you not resolved to encourage SEDLEY and would not every dissuasive be ineffectual But I rejoice to  think you are under no necessity to answer that questionI do not see any suspicious part in SEDLEY'S behaviour and I expect that you will distinguish yourself from the rest of your sex even by the elegance and ingenuousness with which you meet his advances That the event may be happiness to both is most unfeignedly the wish of your  LUCY SAXBY  LETTER C  Mrs  LA MOTTE  to the Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  Prior to the Receipt of the last  IS then the veil rent my good Mr HOMESPUNIs the bruised reed shaken to piecesLanguage was never made equal to such a heartrending subject Remember however even in the midst of affliction remember the character of a  christian pastor  Make haste Oh my unhappy friend to your own cottage Take no vengeance on an unworthy rake even should you find him The thorn is in his heartthe flaming sword is in his bosom My feeble consolations  my hopesmy attentions and my prayers will be for ever at your service Delay not then longer than it is necessary your journey to the parsonageand your real sympathizing  C LA MOTTE  LETTER CI  The Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  YES Mrs LA MOTTEI will remember what is due to the character of a Christian clergyman and I  am  returning as I  ought  to my solitary cottage but let me enjoin youthough your own prudence will render that injunction superfluousnot to satisfy curiosity of any kind whether it comes in the shape of condolence sympathy or surprize as to the true cause of my unfortunate HARRIET'S departure Let her memory escape the censure even of an ill suggestion I write this upon the road at our restingplace while the horses are  baited and the men refreshed Ah my dear Mrs LA MOTTE what a mechanical creature is man People who are hired for their attendance at a funeral are so familiarised to the last ceremonies that they smile in their sables and while they are conveying youth and beauty to the tomb can enjoy the ordinary everyday events of life with as much glee and inconsideration as if they were carrying the gayest bride and bridegroom to the altar The mourners who came with me are at this instant carousing in the next roomwhile she who used heretofore to be the companion of my journeys and made every place a  home  to me by the enchantments of her presence and society is waiting their leisure and lying in a gloomy vehicle without any refreshment whatever  Without refreshment What have I  said and how does my present  practice  contradict my former  precepts  Do I forget the rewards of an innocent  soul  and are all my tears shed over the breathless  body  which being no longer animated by that soul is  nothing  Surely I have lost my wonted sense of religion and Providence  NoMrs LA MOTTEnoI have not To religion and to Providence be every event committedbut  neither  have robbed me of my sensibility and while that remains I cannot "but remember such things were and were most precious to me" Even memory assists in drawing a picture to distress me  She who is there emboxed was one whom I chose from the rest of the world She  was  indeed  my  worldI have seen her walkHer now claycold hand has  been a thousand times joined in that which is now employed in describing her fate  She increased every day in sense and discretion and beautyI think not of her last offencesfor how should village simplicity be a match for town maxims  Neither man nor angel can discern  HYPOCRISY the only evil that walks  Invisible thro' earth  And oft tho' Wisdom wakes Suspicion sleeps  At Wisdom's gate while Goodness  thinks  no ill  Where no ill  seems  It begins to rain Mrs LA MOTTE The drops patter upon the roof of the hearseI put my face to the casement and hear themThe poor little infant toomy boymy darlingmy heirmy firstborn  Oh Mrs LA MOTTE forgiveforgive  meThough I know the independency of soul and body in such a situationthough reason points out to me their separate state yet I cannot all at once disunite them Human Nature powerfulpathetic Nature puts in her plea and you have too much tenderness not to admit itDo not therefore reproach me for ordering another covering to be thrown over the hearse  More weakness Mrs LA MOTTEI have walked forth and am a little relievedthe shower is over Do not argue with me dear friend while the earth contains the beloved  remains  of Mrs HOMESPUN I must consider her as claiming from me respect and tenderness the duties even of the husband do not terminate till she is in the grave  But the sable train have finished their  repastWe are preparing to proceed in our journey The postman is blowing his horn close beside me he says this letter will reach you some hours before the wretched writer of itHe waits while I beg of you to be at the Parsonage against our arrival your presence will be then necessary to prevent me from running the gauntlet through starers and condolers Such pity is at such periods insupportable The hearse is moving awfully on I must not leave it without one  real  mourner  Farewel Farewel HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER CII  Mrs  LA MOTTE  to  PHILIP SEDLEY  Esq  at  BUXTON  After the Return of Mr  HOMESPUN    I CONGRATULATE you Sir on your victory over every feeling that should distinguish the  human  species from the  brutal  or rather I salute you upon your notable transmigration The system of the philosopher who contended for such a change you have adopted even  in this world  with success Yes Mr SEDLEY you are most compleatly  brutalized  indeed Although I have not the  dishonour  to know you personally I make bold to address a few sentiments to you  chiefly to acquaint you with what you might otherwise be for some time ignorant Your principal victims were buried last night and the survivor is in a fair way of soon following them  I could have wished however for the sake of your amusement as it seems you are gratified upon such occasions that you had been a spectator of this funeral Though I can easily conceive you do not love  preaching  yet in the discourse of last night there were such remarks as might have highly diverted so  elevated  a mind as yours  But to drop this ineffectual part of my subject and proceed to another more likely to excite your curiosity Do you know most assiduous and yet most  negligent  Sir that a part of your treasures are now in my possessionTo speak  plainer you must know that amongst the now useless cloaths and other late necessaries of the entombed HARRIET was found a BOOK very thickly marked both by marginal notes crosses of the nail points of the pen and strokes of the pencil and in the fair leaf next the title there is written what distinguishes it to be Mr SEDLEY'S property  Now it plainly appears Sir from the several parts referred to that you purposely pillaged the volume for the  pernicious  and rejected the  instructive  This would have been very proper had you contented yourself like other commentators with reprobating what is  wrong  in order to set it apart from what is  right  but how could such ordinary methods be expected from a person so very  extraordinary  You Sir have even improved upon your original and have ingeniously  laboured to annihilate its merit while you perpetuate its infamy  As an instance of this I select the subsequent  wellillustrated  passages out of a multitude of others equally amiable I shall place both the Commentator and his Author in a seemly orderly manner and as you will easily recollect act the part of a faithful  transcriber  CHESTERFIELD  "Avoid seeing an affront if possible"  SEDLEY  What though L has sorely stung me I must please herand be revenged at a proper timeAt present my cue is  blindness  CHESTERFIELD  "If a man of sense perseveres he will prevail at last"  SEDLEY  Oh DORMER DORMER thou dear encouragerHow dost thou give me spirits to go on H H is an angel of the first order  CHESTERFIELD  "Read faces"  SEDLEY  What a Right Reverend face and how delightfully legible is that of Master Minister HNot a trait of suspicion about it I like his honest broad browhis grey eyewhich looks  at  every thing and  into  nothing The very man Oh divine H H  CHESTERFIELD  "Don't yield to fits of rage"  SEDLEY  I am cursedly addicted to passion  Will curb myselfCoolness carries all before itSaucy L thou shalt suffer for I will  oblige  thee and instead of  contempt  shew thee a  kindness  Then then  Mum  How could the sagacious Mr SEDLEY trust his serious views with the very woman he meant to destroy But that is easily accounted for In another part of the book we find a  clue  to this mystery  CHESTERFIELD  "Be like Caesar's wife  unsuspected"  SEDLEY  Yes dear enchanting HARRIET if it should ever be my fortune to please thee how would I consult the  security  of thy situationhow guard thy fame even with my lifefrom the breath of DetractionAh couldst thou but surmount  the vulgar prejudices of the world couldst thou but read in my countenance the attentiveardenteternal  friend  thetheOh HARRIET HARRIET I will not swear to the truth of my passion lest you should suspect mebut if I might be permitted to ask a favour with all imaginable softness In a word HARRIETThis is the true Volume of DelightThe world is full of masks and if you and I put  ours  delicately on so as to talk not of our own affairs never shew Master Minister H any contempt flatter his little oratorical and classical vanity and assume the proper flexibility what joys may we not taste what treasures of tenderness may we not allow one another  Ah dear arbitresskeep this sacred volume from every eye but your own readand return it to the fondest and most faithful of men  Here break we off Mr SEDLEY to make way for a reflection I have always taken notice that your great schemers counteract their fondest purposes In the very depth of their conspiracy they discover a  little  which serves as a clue to the discovery of a  great deal  nor did I ever know any man who had a  bad  secret to keep and a difficult hand of cards to play that did not by too much caution in some points and too much carelessness in others lose the  honours  of the  game  You under fair pretence of  friendly  ends  And wellplac'd words of glossing courtesy  Baited with reasons not  unplausible  Wind into the easy human heart  And HUG it into snares  And yet Sir to apply one more poetical line to you what after all can be said of you better than this  Oh what a goodly outside falshood hath  These expostulations however Sir are foreign from the purpose of my address which is to intimate to you my design of publishing this odd Volume of the great LORD CHESTERFIELD with the Remarks of the splendid PHILIP SEDLEY  Esq  Such annotations will no doubt give fresh vigour to the sale and add exceedingly to the popularity both of the Original and the Commentary It will at least shew how the  Man of Fashion  may improve upon celebrated precepts and what is perhaps of greater consequence how the  Woman of Innocence  may escape the miseries of the practice Above all things be assured the world shall not long remain unacquainted with the gentleman who has accommodated it with so  spirited  an illustration of a book so much in vogue and who knows but this conduct may tempt you to favour  the public with the remainder of the Volumes equally enriched and by the same eminent hand  I am Sir Your indignant humble servant C LA MOTTE  LETTER CIII  Mrs  THORNTON  to Mrs  MORTIMER  YOU frighten me to death my dear FANNY what can possibly be the matterNot two hours before your alarming letter arrived at Lieutenant VERNON'S I had given away my name my hand and my heart to Mr THORNTON of Leicestershire It is a match of haste but I hope not of rashness He is I find the friend of a gentleman now intimate in your family and by the disordered answers I have received from my husband I am afraid to the wicked schemes of that friend youBut it cannot be Mr THORNTON would not avow any close connection with a character so  atrociousnay I may be mistaken as to the villainy under which you tell me you are dyingDying FANNY MORTIMER Heaven forbidwhat a weddingday have you made of mine My husband too has been in tears almost ever since the receipt of your letter I know not what to write or what to think if you ever loved satisfy the impatience of  Your much disturbed but sincere ARAMINTA THORNTON  LETTER CIV  Mrs  MORTIMER  to Mrs  THORNTON  WRITTEN in the agony of her heart and with a trembling hand receive the last sentiments that are to be expected from your wretched friend  Was  Mr THORNTON then intimate with thetheOh Heavenwas he intimate with thisthisI shudder at his namethis Mr SEDLEY Perhaps he was one of his correspondentsIf so he knew his  designs  and if he  did  know them how shall his heart be appeased for concealing them from the unhappy woman whom they have thrown into despair Yes ARAMINTA I  am  in despair  I am ashamed not only of my friends and my husband but of my shadowI dare not look in the glass  Seek not to know the particulars of whatcannot be spoken to I am abused deceivedand hurt beyond the possibility of cureI  will  die  Dreadful officiousness I had flown up to my chamber and turned the key to indulge my anguish in all that luxury which on such occasions is afforded by solitude when Mr MORTIMER tapped at the door to know how I didMy father sister and all the family followed his example and last of all came my beloved mother whose eye I beheld through the keyhole swimming in tears But I was proof even against this Steady in my resolutions I dared not to admit her  The cause of my new source of grief seems yet to be undiscoveredWhat of thatI know it  myself  The blessed GOD "from whom no secrets are hid" knows it I was myself the aggressor This fatal hand brought about the horrid circumstanceI betrayed my weakness to him in a letterI told him his departure was necessary to my repose  That  was enough to make such a man perpetrate my destruction  PartialityWretch that I wasWhat right had I to be partialMr MORTIMER claimed my heartMr MORTIMER is the best of menMemory be still  Hush ARAMINTA I hear his step on the stairs  He has thrust a card through the door and gone down again softly to the  parlour ARAMINTAthe pen falls from my handWhen I send this I will send with it the cardARAMINTAI  will  not live  Readread and tell me if I ought not to wish for annihilation  The  CARD  inclosed  EDWARD MORTIMER'S tenderest invitations wait on FANNY for her company after she has amused herself with her pen in the parlour as DELIA is going to try a gentle tune on her new Piano Forte EDWARD will attempt a soft accompanyment upon the flute our little brother is to join in the strokes of the violin Sir HENRY and Lady DELMORE are to be our auditors and they are to have quite a little concert But they will  be all out of tune and it is impossible there should be any harmony unless FANNY is amongst them now and then bestowing a note from one of the most melodious pipes in the worldPerhaps Mr SEDLEY may drop in and the manly elegance of his voice will be delightful EDWARD desires his FANNY to observe that this very  full  card is subscribed by all the persons in the world whom she best loves and who best love her namely by  Sir HENRY DELMORE  Lady DELMORE  DELIA DELMORE  And Her EDWARD MORTIMER  I must pause again ARAMINTAmy strength fails me  In Continuation Ten o'Clock at Night  No my friendI could not obey the summonsI could not on the other hand have courage to send an apology About ten minutes after the card was delivered I heard the dear wellknown voice of Lady DELMORE  Sweet as the shepherd's pipe upon the mountains  tenderly enquire"Is my child preparing to join usWill she make us happyTake your own time my love only remember that the pain or pleasure of the night depends upon youDon't hurrydon't discompose your spirits"  The excellent most revered and most  venerable Lady a second time returned unanswered  Oh ARAMINTAARAMINTAhow I wepthow my heart yearned to clasp this dear mother to itbut I was all the time labouring with a dreadful circumstance which to disclose would produce complicated misfortune  God of compassion to what an exigence am I reduced  Scarce had Lady DELMORE withdrawn but Mr MORTIMER ascended the stairs and "Will not my lovely FANNYwill not the wife of my soul condescend to oblige us" said he with a softness that was a fresh occasion of distress to me  I could not upon this avoid giving to some incoherent expressions and  wild ejaculations part of which were uttered upon my knees  The trembling MORTIMER turned down stairs and presently I heard the whole family assembled in the entry leading to the chambers consulting by whisper  They conclude I overhear that my brain is hurtAh that it were ARAMINTAHowhow my friend is this to be accounted for but I would not enter the sleeping apartment of EDWARD MORTIMER for all that the sun surveys beneath his radianceMy soul is not polluted  "When will the darling of my wishes suffer me said MORTIMER just now to lead her from that melancholy chamber to her own apartment"  "Nevernevernever"said I in the extremity of my grief"Never Mr MORTIMER"  "FANNY"replied the astonished MORTIMER"Did you speak my love"  I recollected my imprudence and catching up a piece of paper wrote on it as follows  "LET the dear and honoured friends of FANNY indulge her idle fancy for this single night and they shall command her for the remainder of her whole life She finds herself unusually well and inclined to scribble to her longneglected correspondents and when she is weary she will lie down on the little tentbed in the room where she now is  "Her peace of mind depends so much on their yielding to this request however romantic it may appear that she flatters herself her dear friends will not refuse it to her"  I put this under the bottom of the door and heard the injured yet most delicate MORTIMER immediately carry it away  The maid has brought me a candle and though I find the whole family even to my aged father  he  who must needs want the balms of repose is to set up I am no more to be invadedThis tendernessthis constant uniform compliance distracts mePoorpoor MORTIMERthis is the first time since our union thatthat  Excuse me ARAMINTA I must leave off and think a little  In Continuation  It is midnight ARAMINTA I have come to a resolutionIn the common course of human declinings I cannot live longMy constitution is utterly goneA fair excuse offers during my present state of infirmity to be indulged with an apartment separate from the excellent EDWARD MORTIMER Let me then dare to liveLet me live were it only to prevent a discovery which my death might occasionLet the secret of the most barbarous SEDLEY die with me without involving in it either my father or my husband  The maid tells me the whole house is in tearsWhat my venerable father my motherallall in tears  I was unable longer to support the idea and I will go down to them that they may restBut into the chamber of her husband never shall again go the desolate  FANNY MORTIMER  I will privately give this letter to the postman with my own hand if I can steal out when he calls for othersBut it mustalas my ARAMINTAit  will  be my last  Farewel Farewel  LETTER CV THOMAS  at the Bath to  TIMOTHY  in Town  Dear TIMOTHY  How like a dog look'd Hercules  Thus to a distaff chain'd  'SDEATH TIMONTHY "I'm sped I'm married" In the very flower of my youth in the bud of my adventures I am cut off from all the joys of rambling by matrimony In a word TIMOTHY the first fair she that I was  well with  as the great Lord CHESTERFIELD calls it complained in form to my  master who in the moment of his rage drew his sword cocked his pistol and giving me the choice of two cursed things namely death or a wifewould certainly have sent me to my account "with all my imperfections on my head" even now broad blown in the middle of May if I had not fixed upon something and although in the confusion of my fears I have chosen the worst of the two destinies by taking to my bed the lowborn wench I have  simulated  yet "no man knows the fate he's born to" and I have been to the church with a waterdipper yea TIMOTHY with a creature who for some years hath got her bread by standing at the side of the bath and presenting a brimmer of the water to the passenger Then she is as insipid as the water itself and ten times more illiterate than the tumbler that contains it I marked her out only as a petty experiment just to bring  my hand into play as it were before I ventured to CHESTERFIELDISEa word TIMOTHY I collected from THORNTON'S letters which thou knowest I have an occasional access towith others However my spouseor rather my sposofor I would avoid vulgar expressions which are "certain characteristics of bad company and a bad education"my sposo is wholesome pretty and not illmade but as she has not the smallest degree of  ton  about her and doth not pretend the most distant acquaintance with either A B C or any of the twentyfour members in that learned family I despair of ever making her figure as an editor or indeed of collecting together any of my papers upon which account I charge thee TIMOTHY to preserve very cautiously all my letters notes minutes and maxims and as I shall very soon travelfor a wife at home will only give me  eclat  abroad and thou  canst not believe I will live long with a waterdipper though she were the Nereid of the springthou wilt observe to tie them up date them on the backs docket them and if thou shouldst survive me which I supplicate the heavens thou mayst not I beg of thee to put them into the hand of the best bookseller then in vogue and publish them  against my consent  and as order and method are the very souls of business suppose the title which I am to know nothing of were to run thus  The Letters  of THOMAS TRAVERSE abroad to TIMOTHY TRUEMAN at home containing EVERY INSTRUCTION NECESSARY TO FORM A FOOTMAN OF HONOUR VIRTUE TASTE AND FASHION  Above all points TIMOTHY avoid carelessness let not a slip of our sacred simulations be seen SEDLEY with all his cleverness and graces is a most thoughtless fellowsaving his authority There is not a syllable in his correspondence to THORNTON but I am acquainted with it Many a  small  essential he hits off to admiration As far as the maxims of his Author extends in regard to being well with women he is a wonder But of this exclusive between ourselves he is a bungler He never puts his epistles into the office with his own hand he trusts them to me under the simple safeguard of a wet wafer my knowledge of the world points out to me the necessity of learning all I can especially when I can make observations without being observed But besides this an epistle so hurried off is but half a letter for nicely is it noted that neatness in folding up  sealing  and directing  is by no means to be neglected there is something even in the exterior of a letter that may please or displease and consequently deserves attention Thou must know TIMOTHY and I tell it thee in great confidence that I have bestowed several leisurehours in preparing for thine eye and in due time for the world that is  against my will  a Treatise on Toothpicking wherein I shew the precise method of holding handling drawing and replacing the dentical instruments Besides which I have almost ready an Essay on Nailcutting and I have gone a great way in bringing to perfection an instrumentfor which by the by I expect both a reward and a patentthat is so contrived as to curve the nails prevent their raggedness hinder the flesh from growing up and preserve them smooth even and transparent And that every thing may be compleat I have sketched out a plan for a satire  against tricks and oddities of which I send thee underneath a couplet or two by way of specimen of the work  Some pluck the button from the injur'd cloaths  While others rub the ears and pick the nose  Some are so destitute of air and grace  Even while they speak to turn away the face  Nay some there are to delicacy dead  Who always have the fingers in the head  This smells his meat and makes his neighbour sick  This clown eats slow and that a world too quick  Nay some to such a height is rudeness grown  Will grease their lips in picking of a bone  I must not however forget to apprise thee of the most elaborate of all my works entituled The Art of Carving wherein the adroitness and gentility of doing the honours of the table without hacking across a bone without bespattering the  company with the sauce and without overturning the glasses into our neighbours pockets will be critically considered At the end of my performances I propose to annex certain miscellaneous observations on men and manners such as knowledge of the worldthe taking off the hatoffering the handmaking the bowhanging the swordmanaging the caneholding the knife and forkblowing the noseand all the etcaetera essential to a gentleman I shall by way of supplement add a few  free  thoughts on modest assurance a caveat against bashfulness hints on exterior seriousness and cautions on flexibility of countenance with a key to the heart or the study of weaknesses infirmities foibles and passions illustrated in short TIMOTHY my labours all together will form a compleat commentary on CHESTERFIELD and I would have them lettered  on the back thus TRAVERSE  on  STANHOPE Perspicuity is a peculiar grace  Oh TIMOTHY why were talents like mine denied an adequate fortune Here has SEDLEY been almost a month catching a couple of beautiessimulating a pair of petticoats when I had my purse been like his could have compassed a dozen To say the truth he has been rather unlucky too for one of his damsels is dead and the other is moving off  You will guess what a regard I pay to moral character when notwithstanding my poverty I scorn to repair my shattered fortunes by impeaching him No TIMOTHY that would be baselet every gentleman's affairs be sacred I must not wound my feelingsI must not be blasted TIMOTHYI must not be blasted  I lament nothing my friend but want of  money  and yet I have been lately thinking  manner  may procure even that Surely TIMOTHY the same sprightly powers that can make a cuckold cannot fail if dexterously applied to help a man's pocket There is a very rich old rheumatical heavyheel'd fellow at the bath whom I have fixed my eye upon and am resolved to try the experiment  Surely the serious exterior may befriend us with men as well as women I know his weaknessesand he says he is sure I was born a gentleman Money I must really have  Now taking a ride upon the King's highway rather late in the evening is so cursedly hazardous and I have such an objection to roguery that I cannot think of it but I am persuaded I can simulate  or dissimulatefor I hardly know the distinctiona purse or two and make the person simulated pleased with himself and much obliged to me for taking it This is at worst an ingenious way of running round the halter without putting the neck into it and if we view it as it ought to be viewed it is only a notable way of making a man pay so much gold for so much flattery selflove and satisfaction For the success of all these arduous and laudable undertakings pray TIMOTHY and believe me  Thy constant friend THOMAS  LETTER CVI TIMOTHY  in Town to  THOMAS  at the Bath  Mr THOMAS  I HAVE received safe all the letters you directed to me and I should have honoured them much sooner had it been in my power but the truth is I have too much business to allow much time for pleasureor rather I endeavour to make my pleasure and my business go fair and softly like worthy fellowservants in the same family Besides this TOM you and  your  master and I and  mine  if you will excuse me for following your example of  putting the cart before the horseare so very  different  that it is impossible we should agree upon any point we talk of  I  am a plain fellow with a worstedlaced livery and a wig and  you  a gentleman with ruffles at your wrists tambour waistcoat and your hair tucked in braids under your hat  I  condescend to take a shilling or even sixpence a head by the way of Good bye to you honest TIM from my master's company and  you  are above such a custom and break your guinea at a tavern or a coffeehouse to fling down your halfcrown to the waiter with a dignified disdain like a Prince  PHILIP SEDLEY  Esq  your  Lord makes it his amusement to rattle away from saltwater to freshwater from this polite place to that polite place to speak more properly from one  Ton  to another  Ton  till he has shewn himself  everywhere  without  settling  anywhere  My master on the contrary Mr Michael Bankwell is an elderly industrious regular batchelor of a citizen up at eight and in bed by eleven who keeps me because he says I hit his humour and he hates new faces Moreover Mr TOM there is nothing similar between our families I  save  you do  not  save I am  prudent  you are not I love a wife to whom I have been married fifteen years and am only sorry that I cannot see her more than once in the weekYou are tired of yours to whom you have not been a week married I delight in the appellation of plain TIM or TIMOTHY You are offended unless Sir or Mr precedes the name which was bestowed upon you by your godfathers and godmothers  In short TOMI beg pardonin short Mr THOMAS I begin to think as we so little resemble one another either in our  likings or aversions that we had better not put ourselves for the future to the expence of postage which as you and your master are addicted to go pretty far into the country and you are apt to write four letters where a man of less genius and spirit would scarce write one is really a serious circumstance  Not that I should propose such a matter neither were there no other obstacle in the way for to flourish for a moment in your mode I must inform you that  The friends I have and their adoption try'd  I'd grapple to my heart with hooks of steel  Frankly to speak therefore Mr TRAVERSE though you are undoubtedly a youth of parts and able to do as much harm as any lad I know you are not the man to my mind In a word TOM I never took kindly to you and since your last letter  which lies on the table before me I like you less than ever  And so you look like a  dog  now you have got a wife do you TOM and marriage at threeandtwenty you call being  cut off  Take care you are not cut off in your flower  another  way For if the scheme of  simulating  the meaning of which God knows the rheumatical gentleman's money out of his pocket should fail and you should employ the sprightly powers you talk of in making him part with it whether he will or no you may stand a chance to be promoted even sooner than you wish  With respect to the books you figure so much upon I know nothing about them and if they relate only to picking of teeth and turning out of toes paring of nails blowing noses and taking off hats I must  beg to be excused having any thing to do with it in the first place because I think I know all these things partly as well as his Lordship and perhaps some of them better As to knives and forks I believe I can handle them as well as any nobleman in the universeI am no bad carver unless I am sharpset I am not to be told when it is my duty to have my hat under my arm and as to the rest I never understood till his  Lordship told  me that it was decent to pick the teeth at all in company if it could be avoided  I shall make you laugh no doubt when I acquaint you that I approve a custom my master has of reading to his family every Sunday evening and as to books I have as many as serve my purpose namely a Testament left by my aunt Mary in the year a Whole Duty of Man Farriery made Easy and The Servants Guide  You wish for a full purse you say for the sake of doing more injuries to innocent women there we differ again though I am in the main contented with what I  have  I now and then sigh for an increase of fortune to distribute amongst many worthy people whom I  know  to be under a cloud and if I thought you would not smile too much I should venture to tell you that I have two little orphan cousins in my eye who shall not want a  friend  if they turn out wellthough they have lost a father and I have more pleasure in seating my old frail mother in her armchair by a chearful fire and giving now and then a necessary to a blind brother that I have all which I pinch out of my perquisites and wages than it is possible you should even  simulate  as you call it out of a stranger or get by the ruin of all the men women and children in BUXTON  And so pretty polite Mr THOMAS I leave  you  to  your  undertakings and beg that you will do me the favour to leave me to mine  Lombardstreet London  TIMOTHY TRUEMAN  LETTER CVII SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  OH THORNTONTHORNTON THORNTONI must write I must fly to thy kind bosom for resource although it were only to tell thee that thy prophecy is fulfilled There walks not the insulted earth at this present moment such a rascalsuch a wretchsuch a fiend as PHILIP SEDLEYOh my GOD what a stroke of heart have I this instant sustainedThe dead of the night thou knowest is generally my hour for projection and as this evening was particularly dark serene and favourable to my purpose of reflecting upon the mischiefs of the morrow I left my chamber about  eleven o'clock and took the path that would soon have brought me to a little grove by the side of a still streamlet where I could have indulged "meditation even to madness" But oh Mr THORNTON what an agonizing interruption met me in the way As I reached the door where I lately resided for on HORACE'S return to town I changed my lodgings what of all things horrible to the heart dost thou think I sawNot lightning not the flames of a burning town but a single torch that displayed to me  two coffins  containing the two fair creatures in whose fates I had been instrumental carried on the shoulders of the attendants to a hearse that was standing ready to receive them yes my friendHARRIET HOMESPUN and the pledge of chaste embraces were both passing to their last home I gave a scream that broke voluntarily from my bosomI fainted in  the arms of a person that was standing in a pensive posture against the side of the hearseOh Mr THORNTONit was HORACE himselfit was the honest man the kind friendthe unsuspicious priest that I had injured past redemptionI recovered only to meet an eye that sunk me to the earth againthe dominion of the accursed DORMER was pastTruth took me by the heartstrings and Conscience cast me upon the knee I had no power over my own faculties and the God of Nature did as he thought proper I took the coffin of the wife in my arms I bathed it with the scalding tears of unaffected penitenceI told the poor trembling astonished priest  whom  he might thank for all his miseries  whom  he might consider as the murderer of his family I usually carry with me in my nightwalks a swordI was armed with one at presentI offered it to the hand of HORACE  I tore open my waistcoatbared my breast and begged from him the stroke of mercyHe refused to give me the death I merited Cruel man he left me to my GOD I caught the weapon shortened it and pointed it at the detested heart that directed the detested hand▪ but even here I was disappointed by th  barbarity of HORACE who wrenched it from me ere I had little more than perforated the skin and assuring the attendants that I was at times as now disordered in my senses ordered the hears  to pass on He mounted his horsebad  the landlord go quietly to bedsay nothing of what had happenedand wipin  his eyes rode after the machine that contained the ruins of his family  I was left alonemy shame is revealed every man's tongue will be against me on the morrowI have followed my  Preceptor into the pit of irremediable perdition Repentance is the labour of a life a minute's ignominy is to me insupportableI will leave this cursed place directlyI will saddle my horse privately but never never shalt thou again be disgraced my still beloved THORNTON by the presence of the  Detestible PHILIP SEDLEY  P S  The poor FANNY MORTIMER too is dyingI have reduced to ashes  that  family also To possess her undefended form in a swoon What violence What villainy Oh shame shameI will not send this letter at presentI must ask the forgiveness of the expiring FANNY  before I die or else I should be ashamed even to leave existenceI  will  see her Poor MORTIMER how have I wronged theeUnhappy DELIA how have I deceived thee Let no man be tempted by the maxims of a casuist to leave the plain simple path of singleness and be it engraven upon every heart indelibly that HYPOCRISY however polished will lead us to the gates of Hell and that TRUTH only TRUTH can conduct us through  her  temple to Heaven  LETTER CVIII  Mr  MORTIMER  to Mr  THORNTON  At Lieutenant  VERNON  'S  Sir  I AM this moment arrived in town from BUXTON where the body of your wounded friend Mr SEDLEY will be found either by you or any of those who think it worth while to own him He has as I suppose you know been the occasion of the most multiplied mischief that ever was I believe committed in the same  space of time in that or any other town His death however and his repentance which appears to be sincere are all that man can have  It would by no means interest a stranger as you are Sir to particularize the sorrows your friend has introduced not only in my family but others equally happy before his admittance into them But I understand from this libertine who put your late letters into my hand after I had wounded him that you have married the most intimate friend of my dishonoured FANNY to her it will not be uninteresting to observe that it is impossible she should ever behold again alive that most injured and unfortunate girl who was upon the point of expiring before I left BUXTON which I thought it prudent to do notwithstanding my indifference  to all future events till I see what is to be done with the brokenhearted authors of FANNY'S existence  The scene of Mr SEDLEY'S villainy has I perceive been already exhibited to the eye of Mr THORNTON who hath it seems long been his confident and correspondent though he must pardon me if I esteem  him  less worthy the nobleminded ARAMINTA who could countenance by his regard the actions of a PHILIP SEDLEY Happy however am I to hear for his lady's sake that the connection is at length dissolved The affair betwixt me and the offender happened in the dead of night the surgeon to whom I went myself in defiance of danger assures me the wound is vital Mr SEDLEY who could not speak gave me at my departure your address I  must be excused from discovering mine to Mr THORNTON at present and I only write to acquaint him of his friend's situation My own misery is indeed extreme but I have the honour to be  Sir  Your most humble servant EDWARD MORTIMER  LETTER CIX  Miss  DELIA DELMORE  to Lady  LUCY SAXBY  NEVER was the ruin of a happy family so rapidly compleated as that of your wretched DELIA DELMORE'S All the fair hopes that I communicated to Lady LUCY in my late letters are now totally overthrown and the fairy prospect I drew before her eye hath terminated in death and horror Oh LADY SAXBY I can scarce command my hand or my tears to enter into explanations but your kind condolence is the only consolation now fest me and I will endeavour to collect myself  About twelve o'clock last night a horseman stopt at our door and knocked loudly for admittance We were seated quite out of spirits at the table and had just been talking about withdrawing for the night while poor Mrs MORTIMER was lulling her cares to rest upon the sopha having past the day in a manner too melancholy to describe to you WILLIAM had scarce opened the door when a person dismounted from a panting hardridden horse and rushed into the middle of the supperroom without any ceremony We soon discovered through the dreadful metamorphose the features of Mr SEDLEY his waistcoat unbutton'd his hair without a ribbonhis shirt spotted with blood at the bosom his face pale and squallid and his eyes bearing all the marks of terror and desperation Without making any apology for his intrusion he drew a chair from the side of the room flung himself  into it stampt his foot twice against the floor smote his breast with an air of inexpressible vengeance and taking a paper from his pocket held it at arm's length and burst into tears By this time our attention was diverted from this alarming object to another still more dreadfulpoor FANNY MORTIMER was in the strongest convulsions I ever remember to have seen SEDLEY tossed away the paper after he had crushed it in his hand and flew like lightning to Mrs MORTIMER my father mother and my brother all assisted we hurried her up stairs as I had got to the edge of the door I saw Mr MORTIMER with a trembling hand pouring out a glass of the brandy and lean almost ready to sink against the wainscot and just as I left the room he took up the paper that SEDLEY had thrown away It is a good way to any bedchamber and the stairs is  steep we were sometime reaching FANNY'S apartment she remained insensible When we got her into the bedroom Mr SEDLEY went down stairswhere he had not been two minutes before the words villain impostor murderer were vehemently reverberated Sir HENRY ran to the head of the stairs and saying that he distinguished the clashing of swords ran down with the utmost precipitation my mother followed him and FANNY started from the bed and staggering at every step begg'd for God's sake I would conduct her down Terror gave her swiftness horror lent her temporary strength she was in the supperroom in a moment but even  that  was a moment too latefor Oh Lady LUCY the deed was doneMr SEDLEY was upon the ground writheing in blood and Mr MORTIMER was sobbing in his chair with the weapon of destruction  smoaking in his handFANNY MORTIMER sawshriek'dshiver'd and fell down even at this moment she lies distracted Her senses are quite gone neither bleeding chafingnor any other applications can recover hershe pierces us to the heart with her cries She execrates first SEDLEY then herselfthen MORTIMER SEDLEY is put into one of our bedsmy poor father wishes to hush the horrid affair as long as possibleMr MORTIMER without a servant has taken the road to LONDON and from thence to FRANCE SEDLEY has never been able to articulate a word That  paper  Lady SAXBY that fatal paper  This was the last letter Mr SEDLEY wrote to THORNTON but delayed the sending of it till he had seen Mrs MORTIMER See Letter CVII  created all the mischief I inclose you a copy of it from whence you may guess the other horrid  deeds committed by this allaccomplished villain What is to be done Heaven knows We are all inexpressibly miserable I cannot go on the cries of FANNY are again begun  DELIA DELMORE  LETTER CX  Sir  HENRY DELMORE  to Mr  THORNTON  Sir  YOUR letter came to me too late the despoiler of my family left this world about an hour before its arrival his body however shall be conveyed according to your directions It was his dying request that he should be brought before Mrs MORTIMER my wretched daughter but he expired before the request could possibly be granted In his pocket which he begged with his last words I would search was found a small manuscript that he enjoined me to consider  as the instrument of every circumstance that had happened On opening this I discovered written with a pencil the following maxims the practice of which might very properly lead to more mischief if that were possible than they have occasioned  MAXIMS  Have a serious  exterior  A modest assurance  Study command of temper and countenance  Dissemble resentment  Judge of  other  men by your  own  feelings  Be upon your  own  guard  Throw others off  theirs  Study the passions and foibles of both sexes  Flatter the vanity of all  A flexibility of manners commendable  Soothe allplease allconquer all  Be every thing to every body  These are I perceive selected from the pernicious volumes of the late Lord CHESTERFIELD whose letters falling into the hand of a voluptuous character might very naturally produce effects the most dreadful It is very unhappy that me and mine should have been marked out as the first victims But that misfortune like every other must be sustained to the best of my ability My poor daughter is not dead her senses are in some measure restored to her and perhaps the life of her mother husband and father may be made supportable by her preservation In the midst of my own misery Sir I have a wish for the nuptial joy of you and the amiable young lady to whom you are now so tenderly united I formerly knew the brave Lieutenant VERNON and I beg the compliments of a forlorn parent may be made welcome to him recollect me also kindly to Mrs THORNTON and Mrs VERNON  The corpse of Mr SEDLEY shall be sent to your address as soon as the hearse can be provided He purposely concealed himself from all his worthy connexions here nor did I know till the receipt of yours the illustrious ancestors and family of the man to whom I am indebted for this accumulated agony Notwithstanding thismy resentment survives not the life of the aggressor whom I will see justice and decency done to with a scrupulous exactness  His  loss of honour would ill warrant  my  loss of humanity  I am Sir Your obedient servant HENRY DELMORE  LETTER CXI  Miss  DELIA DELMORE  to Lady  LUCY SAXBY  Dated six Weeks after the preceding  My dear Lady LUCY  PROVIDENCE and Felicity seem again disposed to smile upon us The trial and honourable acquittal of Mr MORTIMER is over and the thousand tender assurances he has given his FANNY whom Heaven hath spared to us that the violence she sustained is quite forgotten have contributed with the caresses of her affectionate parents to reconcile her to that  life which God seems intending to continue Though extremely weak she is in perfect possession of her senses and mends every day There is certainly some turn in her favour and perhaps she is preserved as an example of Almighty benignity that will not desert persevering goodness and patient affliction The truth of Mr SEDLEY'S deathI mean as to the precise occasion of itis little known The Judge was extremely delicate on the subject so was every body concernedMr SEDLEY'S relations have not wept over the ashes of their kinsman nor does any body seem to regretthough every body professes to be astonished For my own partI heartily detest his memory Mr MORTIMER is so truly tender of FANNY that her gratitude seems ripening into love none ever deserved a fonder return than our MORTIMER  In a wordI warmly hope happiness will again subsist amongst us On Thursday se'nnight our whole family sets out for Montpelier the southern softness and a short absence from the scenes of irksome reflection with a change of air and company may be of service to us all That in the mean time you may enjoy all the tranquility of a worthy and ingenuous spirit is the oftenrepeated prayer of  My dear Lady LUCY  Your own undisguised DELIA DELMORE  FINIS
