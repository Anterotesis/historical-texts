 A SCOTSMAN'S REMARKS On the FARCE of LOVE A LA MODE SCENE by SCENE As it is acted at the THEATRE ROYAL in Drury Lane  Nemo me impune lacessit  LONDON Printed for J BURD near the Temple Gate Fleetstreet M DCC LX Price One Shilling  A Scotsman's Remarks c  WITHOUT any ostentatious display of the origin of  Comedy  or  Farce  as is but too usual among prosessed pamphleteers I shall confine this criticism solely to the piece in question  Love à la Mode  The business of it in the sense of Horace is a subject  publici juris  a common and obvious one to all writers and will remain so to the end of time to wit a young lady's being courted by a number of contrasted lovers whose characters from their discordance with each other are to furnish out the comic entertainment  Of this kind we have several on the English besides those on other theatres  of Europe viz MISS LUCY IN TOWN MISS IN HER TEENS C  And yet an author may derive merit from this subject of  common right  as we may call it in proportion as he shall introduce personages of an higher rank of life more elegant colouring and a quite novel complexion  Whenever this shall be executed it is to be looked upon as the work of true genius but when fallen short of as often happens it is to be deemed the impotent effort of the hardbound brains of low plagiaries whose memory is filled with the shreds and illchosen scraps of other mens wit  In which of these two classes the author of  Love à la Mode  is to be ranked will appear from the subsequent remarks whom however the most inveterate enemies he has cannot refuse being guilty of  modesty  and  gratitude  on this occasionOf  modesty  in not  publishing  and of  gratitude  in not giving his generous benefactors occasion of repenting their having patronized such coarse inaccurate scenes and so affrontful to themselves  To proceed methodically let us  first  examine into the propriety of the characters of his drama and  secondly  how he has conducted the whole and how brought on and carried off his people  The DRAMATIS PERSONAE are  Sir THEODORE GOODCHILD a wealthy merchant of London  MORDECAI a wealthy Jew fop  Sir ARCHIBALD M'SARCASM a Scotch knight  Sir CALLAGHAN O BRALLAGHAN an Irish officer in the Prussian service  GROOME an English esquire fond of racehorses c  CHARLOTTE a young lady of a considerable fortune and the ward of Sir  Theodore  Propriety of characters for the present purpose may be divided into two sorts The one to make them act and speak in every thing suitably to their intended purpose untainted by any peculiarly vicious manner of country or educationThe other is when the character is made to  result intirely from a provincial dialect and local manners  The chief mongrel characters of this farce are a monstrous compound of both There is nothing merely national in either the  Scotch  or  Irish  man but an apeing of the vulgar accent of bothnations with a few strained not natural blunders in the  Hibernian  hero's mouth since such the author has been pleased to constitute him  The character of  M' Sarcasm  is somewhat of  Rancune  's cast in the comic romance written by the facetious  Scarron  He is a rascal in every sense who delights in flattering all present man or woman to his or her face shrugging contempt at them at the same time when they turn their backs and tearing them to pieces when absent  This character is the produce of every climate and the  Irish  in general if we take their own words for it I mean no national reflection for that I scorn implead themselves for a too general tendency to detraction and to the first comer whereas the  Scots  are very cautious to whom they  disclose their disadvantageous opinions of any person  Sir  Callaghan O Brallaghan  is made a Prussian officer to introduce him under that passport more favourably to the crowd If the author had chosen it he might with  much justice and perhaps more have introduced a  Scotsman  in that service there being no corps of either nation in it as in  France  and that moreover there was in favour of the  North Briton  his brave countryman general  Keith  who had long shared the favour assisted in the councils and ultimately fallen in the service of Prussia's everglorious monarch  It sure then ill becomes any assumed character of officership in that heroic service to squint the least however indirectly against  Scotch  valour which is impudently done more than once in this farce  An  Irish  officer in the  French Spanish  or  Austrian  service would have been more agreeable to the general received notions of mankind But such an incoherent medley of heroism and stupidity as  O Brallaghan  is dished out here by his countryman  ver has been exhibited before nor ought  to be borne by any audience that would lay a claim to rationality  Mordecai  the beau Jew is nobody a mere expletive football persona to be made a cat's paw of to be abused insulted and have jokes cracked upon him  Squire  Groome  is no national characteristic of England but a general representative of any person of the three kingdoms who likes horseracing drinking c preferably to any other happiness but why he should be the type of the English nation I cannot see and therefore leave it to the very jumbling author to explain in the best manner he can for objects receive strange aspects as they pass through the  camera obscura  of his intellect  Sir  Theodore Goodchild  as well as his ward  Charlotte  are two very silly schemers considering how the world is at present situated and that all marriages are rather the objects of prudence than passion We are not  Arcadian  shepherds either in this or the next  island  As I am but lately come from Scotland the first view I had of  Love à la Mode  was  on Saturday se'nnight when a young gentleman who sat near me in the pit was pleased to inform me that it had been much shortened and altered for the better since the first performance of it That moreover it used at first to be preceded by a plaintive prologue spoken as was supposed by a waternymph or one like  Niobé  all tears to deprecate the public's resentment from the vile stuff that was to be presented nay he added it was not unlike a child's endeavouring with sobs and tears to conciliate the favour of an incensed public in the behalf of a sinful but repenting parent  The piece opens by Sir  Theodore  and  Charlotte  's having agreed to lay a scheme to try which of her lovers was the most sincere by their declaring after dinner that he was a bankrupt c and she ruined of consequenceA pretty amusement for a wealthy merchant and an experiment that few young ladies of fortune ought to try nowadays however great their merit nay even granting that of their suitor and his having strong affections for them  There are family reasons such as the providing for the younger children c which would prove often insurmountable obstacles where poverty should really be presented in the place of an expected large fortune  She gives to her guardian as if he had neither known nor seen them before a respective description of her woersIf it was meant to inform the audience it is stupid enough that is like prefixing an explanatory argument to a play their appearance and business is to let the audience into the secret of what they are which accounts should ever be shortly done and to those supposed not to have had any prior knowledge  That given of the Jew beau  Mordecai  as well as the treatment of him throughout is idly and grosly insulting a body of people since the Jewact has not taken place and who ought to meet with better treatment from a man who owed his geting any footing on the stage to the supposition of his having well represented one of their community  That given of  M'Sarcasm  is partly already hinted at with his being vainglorious of the antiquity of his family  That of 'Squire  Groome  gives but a very faint idea of what the actor's excellence displays  The picture drawn of the  Irish  hero is rather that of a bully than a brave officer nor is either wrote up nor consequently acted up to He is described with a highcocked hat long sword shortskirted coat and affecting a tremendous stride to which the lady adds  You would think that  Mars  had been his fosterfather and  Bellona  his nurse c  there needed only to have been added that every morning he drank gunpowder tea for his breakfast and that he swallowed pistol balls  like sugarplumbs  by way of helping digestion  Yet when Sir  Callaghan  comes into action both his language and demeanor are of the gentlest cast  Sir  Theodore  pretends business out in order to give room for  Charlotte  's receiving all her lovers before dinner to which  they had been invited and are expected except 'Squire  Groome  who was it seems engaged in a great horsematch at Newmarket  Sir  Theodore  on his going out is met by the first arrived visitor  Mordecai  who enters rather like a masquerade buffoon than any thing else and disgracing Italian airs like a lunatic  castrato  After a few commonplace compliments he upon her beauty she upon his taste elegance c she accuses him with addressing a certain lady c he expresses great uneasiness to know from whom she had learned it she tells him from  M'Sarcasm  Here  Mordecai  adds to the already disadvantageous character given of the  North Briton's  poisonous tongue by calling him the scandal spreader and Pasquin of the town and says he is so great a scoundrel no gentleman of his country will keep him company  This is but a poor salvoWhy then impose all the scoundrelism of the piece upon Scots shoulders It certainly was by  no means intended as a compliment but rather as a gross affront to  North Britain  as well as the weak designer could execute it  M'Sarcasm  comes into Miss  Charlotte's  apartment and though on an intended visit to her sees  Mordecai  before the lady though why we are not told in order it seems to have a little fun with himThere is great art here  He then turns to the lady asks her pardon for not having seen her before though she was as obvious an object as then in a very tiresome drawling hesitating repeating and on the whole execrable imitation of the Scots accent through which breaks out ever and anon the  Irish brogue  Among other things in his very uncouth address he declares her to be "an epitome of all mentel and bodely perfections and that she is a devenety" Sir  Callaghan O Brallaghan  's name being brought on the carpet  M'Sarcasm  bids them not to be uneasy about him that he has brought him along with him for C  that like the kings of old he never travels without his ful and that he has left him writing a love epistle below stairs which he is sure has not been equalled since the days of Don  Quexote  Eh  He does not tell us in what apartment below stairs he had left him This gives a very contemptible idea of the author's hero that by  M'Sarcasm  a known rival's advice he should misemploy so much time below stairs in penning either a sonet or an epistle while the other during that interval was making the most of his suit  Mordecai  desirous to have a slice as they call it of the  Irishman  by way of a whet before dinner goes off and commodiously to give  M'Sarcasm  an opportunity of abusing all his rivals which he does elaborately  Squire  Groome  he represents to her as a man of ruined fortune a Newmarket sharper a contemptible jokey who would always prefer his horses c to her  Mordecai  his favourite butt for abuse he vilisies among other things for his complexion c  The  Irishman  he bids her beware of on account of his being her guardian's nephew whom he insinuates to her he has certain information of having a design upon her fortune  He lastly comes to himself and then blazons forth to her the advantages that she will have though sprung from sugarhogsheads rumpuncheons a comptinghouse c to be married into an ancient femily of which there are four vicounts six earls three marquesses and twa duks besides lairds and baronets out of aw rechoning beyond numberWhat humming and hawing in this dull prolix declaration  Where is the propriety of  Charlotte  's guardian being uncle to Sir  Callaghan  It gives room to suspect a collusion  Beau  Mordecai  the little  Girgeshite  returns brimful of joy to tell them the  Irishman  is coming Sir  Callaghan  whom from the description given of his person and carriage one was to expect to see enter the room in a most formidable swaggering  manner and dealing terror around on the contrary comes on with all the mild vacancy of looks that denote a goodnatured untravelled young man  He addresses the lady rather with respectful bashfulness and timidity than conformable to the boisterous picture  Charlotte  had drawn of him and up to which his dialogue is not written so the actor is not at all in fault but the author is for his inconsistences  He is asked to indulge the lady with the description of a battle which he declines at first for the reason that he thinks it unbecoming to make mention of such matters before a lady and that it favours too much of the  Fansaron  But urged farther he declares to her "that there is so much doing every where there is no knowing what is done any wherethat every man has so much business of his own he has no time to mind that of his neighboursthat there is such drumming and shouting and smoke and fighting and the delicious noise of arms that it is no more possible to give an account  of a battle than of the stars in the firmament"  M'Sarcasm  like another  Iago  in order to bring  Mordecai  into a scrape eggs him on to put to Sir  Callaghan  such questions as might the readier provoke his anger  Mordecai  asks in a pert manner "Pray Sir  Callaghan  how many men may you have killed in your time"To which Sir  Callaghan  replies "More than a coward would choose to eat or an impertinent fellow would dare to look onSo are you answered Mr Beau  Mordecai  "  M'Sarcasm  hugs himself with joy at the agreeable notion of  Mordecai  's running himself into a scrape which might probably rid him of both rivalsHe encourages him to go on  To  Mordecai  's ridiculous taunting and saying If he were a general Sir  Callaghan  rejoins turning to the lady "Look at the general Madamit is a trade not so easy to be learned it requires great genius as well as being up late and early enduring the summer's scorching heat and winter's freezing cold dangers should be  his chief delight glory ever in view death his greatest reward by which he will  live  for ever"  During this speech the Scot and the Jew are chuckling to each other the latter bursting into a sit of laughter cries "O the bull a man live by death"  Sir  Callagh  "Yes Mr  Mordecai  a man live by his death Is not Julius Caesar Alexander and all the other heroes tho' dead two thousand years ago alive in history and will be so to the end of time And is not your brave young General who died for his country's glory before QUEBEC as much alive as any of them and will be so to the end of time"  This is a mobtimed nay begging  claptrap  and therefore the lady with a swelling breast figures in to this purpose "All the brave men who perished on that occasion must be thought on with applause while British annals or British gratitude remains"  The  Durseys  the  Lockmans  the  Macleanes  and all of that species are sure of claps by such springes to catch woodcocks  but true genius disdains because the claims it has on same derive from more noble motives  Opportunely a message comes about dinner which draws away the  Lady  and the  Jew    M'Sarcasm  having represented the latter as a most contemptible being a rascal c to the  Irishman  asks him if he has written the letter according as he had advised to the young lady  Sir  Callaghan  replies in the negative but says he has written a letter to the uncle which in his sense will do as well At this answer  M'Sarcasm  sniggers to himself and prays to hear the contents as matter of entertaining curiosity  Among other articles  O Brallaghan  reads in the letter "nothing is so unbecoming a man of honour as to behave like a scoundrel" upon the novelty of which sentiment  M'Sarcasm  sneeringly compliments him which the dubbed hero receives kindly  In the subsequent part of his letter is this paragraph "bidding him to consider the antiquity of the  O Brallaghans  family  as old nay older than any family in the three kingdoms or even in Europe it being related to all the  O Sullivans O Shaghesesnys O Flahertys M'Dermots M'Cloghlans c"  a thorough Milesian list  M'Sarcasm  objects to the assertion of his family being so ancient and that when he said so he must have lost fight of the North Britons who are the only pure nobility in Great Britain  O Brallaghan  answers "he knew very well what he had said" upon which  M'Sarcasm  insinuates in an angry manner "that his having said so must be attributed to his ignorance and vanity"  O Brallaghan  kindles and says he does not understand what  M' Sarcasm  would be at who says that  O Brallaghan  's assertion must be ascribed "to his being ignorant and vain"  O Brallaghan  in a mild manner declares that  M' Sarcasm  must eat his words or give him  Brallaghan  satisfaction  M'Sarcasm  with a violent affectation of irascibility draws for immediate action against which on account of the  impropriety of the place  O Brallaghan  expostulatesBut upon  M' Sarcasm  's insisting from a supposed surmise of his antagonist's being shy  O Brallaghan  draws and tells him that since determined he is as welcome as the flowers in June  The covert sneer against the brave Highlanders before Quebec is too flagrant The whole of the  Irish  being called  outcasts  of the  Scots  and the  Scots  being retorted as  Irishmens  bastards c is too vile for criticism  Upon this scussle with the usual decorum of the rest of the characters entering comes on alone unattended by servants c the lady and asking what's the cause of quarrel Sir  Callaghan  answers It was about  M'Sarcasm  's grandmother c  The lady having made peace on which occasion the  Scotchman  is made the readier to strike and after bids the  Irishman  aside not to expose himself in speaking about  the  Belles Lettres Classics c  of which  teague had not mentioned the least word upon account of the damnable twist upon his tongue  Sir  Callaghan  replies this is one of the scenes like humour That it is not he but  M'Sarcasm  that has so damned a northern brogue that nobody can understand him  For a decision they both apply to the lady who answers in so politely cautious a manner as to make them both happy and goes off praying that they will not tarry coming to dinner  But the two lovers appetites not being so keen as the lady's they remain and on  M'Sarcasm  's advising Sir  Callaghan  to be vigorous and push his point the other sings a song declaratory of his sentiments  O you never did hear  Of an Irishman's fear  In love or in battle c  The sense of the rest is that they make all the men in fighting and all the women in intriguing strike to them which is tantamount to an old song amongst the lowest class of prosligates that are banished to England from that country For fighting and f**** to write in the Tristram Shandy way there is nobody like us  For English fathers with their daughters English husbands with their wives English brothers with their sisters c to attend to encourage and applaud such gross ribaldry declares them truly meritorious of the cornuted honours said to be so often conserred upon them by their western brethrenwhen they take a moment's leisure to think they must be covered with shame and confusion in regard to modesty and their own dignity  An indecent song having closed the first act the interval between that and the second is filled up with a dinner which with as much accuracy as the preceding business might be brought on the stage  The second act begins by  M' Sarcasm  's instead of a servant's announcing to the young lady the arrival of her other original lover 'Squire  Groome  from Newmarket  In attempting to give a picturesque account of  Groome  's person and attire who is come in the very jockey dress in which he had rode a match  M'Sarcasm  says with his usual studied stupidity that he is come in  Aw his pontisicalibus  a jockey garb is a curtailed abridged and tight  dress whereas the word pontisicalibus conveys the idea of an ample flowing and a pompous one and we might with as much justice say that a prelate in the full sweep and sway of his robe is in a trim jockey dress  M'Sarcasm  having discharged his packet relative to 'Squire  Groome  in order as it were to relieve guard enters  Mordecai  with more news about him and the transaction between the  Irish  and the  Newmarket  heroes  On  Mordecai  's declaring that there is a warm contest between the two  M'Sarcasm expresses  his joy in hopes of a speedy effusion of either Irish or Newmarket blood that of both would please him best so wicked and bloodyminded a rascal is he painted  His shortlived pleasure is soon converted into sorrow when  Mordecai  informs him that their contest goes no farther than to try who will or can drink  Charlotte  's health in the greatest quantity of claret and that the challenge as he came from them had risen from one to a three pint bumper  Such business would be much sitter scened in one of the taverns of Covent Garden  purlieus  than in the house of a sober and reputable merchant of London  Gentlemen of that sedate class of life very seldom rather never permit such riotous doings in their houses which would be a very pernicious example for their servants c and detrimental to their own characters  But trespasses of this kind are nothing to our confounding author who treats nature reason and decency with a total disregard and seems prosessedly to have made an experiment to know how far absurdity can be relished in the present too general depravity of taste  At last on comes or rather in tumbles 'Squire  Groome  hallooing like mad and drunk he begins by excusing himself to  Charlotte  for not having come sooner and been time enough for dinner which he imputes to a brother Buck's having borrowed his watch to set another by but that he put his  Groom  's two hours back which was the occasion of his error in time  He bids her ladyship look at it for that "it regulates the sun and that they all stop by it at Newmarket" When asked by  M' Sarcasm  how soon he could come from York to London he answers That barring any accident of leg arm c he would engage to do it in sixteen hours thirtysix minutes and seventeen seconds or thereabouts he makes some immaterial amendment of his calculation  The inquisitive  M' Sarcasm  ever studious to make his rivals expose their weak side entreats and obtains of him an account of the match he rode for and won  Groome  from the exuberance of his heart tells it was a subscriptionmatch for which each person had deposited so much every subscriber to ride his own beast he enumerates the odds against him  Turning to the lady he says "A little after they set out she might have covered them all with her underpetticoat but that in a short time one of the match was run away with by his horse out of the course then rode over an exciseman two lawyers and a  beau Jew  what an unnatural  passion this preternatural author has for  Jew beans  with such a chocolatecoloured phiz as  Mordecai  He then describes how he jockey'd the rest along the course and won the race  The words are the poorest commonplace language as  all fudge  c used at every horsecoursethe acting is exquisite and even beyond the author's meaning It was the actor of  Groome  that roused a torpisied yawning audience the first night and rescued it from damnationNo  King  no  Love à la Mode  notwithstanding  M'Sarcasm O Brallaghan  and the  Israelite  M'Sarcasm  asks  Groome  what had induced him to come and visit Miss  Charlotte  in that dressHe answers that the bloods of the turf all offered a bet that he would not ride to  London  and visit his mistress in the very jockey garb in which he had run the race he took them all up and had consequently taken them all in as the saying is  M'Sarcasm  to lure him on affects to greatly admire his wonderful deeds upon  which  Groome  tells him that he had run a snail with his grace and won it hollow by half a hornHalf a horn quoth the intelligent  M'Sarcasm  that was hollow indeed Then he is arch on to what a perfection the gentlemen of the South have brought all these matters  Upon which  Groome  exulting declares "that he will ride a match fight a main of cocks drive an equipage or hunt a pack of hounds for a thousand guineas with any nobleman in Europe and he says done first"  O wonderful says fleering  M'Sarcasm  to the lady he hunts all animals from the flea in the blanket to the elephant in the forest"This is certainly new"He is indeed Madam a very  Nimrod  " "Yes I am a  Nimrod  " answers  Groome  It is too arduous a task to attempt unfolding the many latent beauties in this piece therefore it is to be hoped a few specimens will suffice  The reader may with reason ask but all this time what is become of Sir  Callaghan  Why has he been deprived of hearing the description of  Groome  's match Has he not been able to carry the bumpers that he had been drinking with  Groome  to  Charlotte  's health or is he fallen asleep and tumbled under the table But in what room or part of the house we really do not know  It is agreed upon however that he is to be cited to the acting chamber to afford diversion to the lady and her lovers When  Groome  hears of it he says with astonishment "An Irishman make love I should be glad to hear what an  Irishman  can say when he makes love"  M'Sarcasm  the  Jew  and  Groome  retire to a corner of the room to overhear and be diverted with  O Brallaghan  's addresses to the lady who is advised by  M'Sarcasm  to ask him for his sonet which he protests will highly entertain her ladyship  Besides the  stupidity  of the device what lady of the least education would cooperate to exhibit a woer her guardian's nephew too for a ridiculous entertainment to his rivals whom she despises There  are many courtezans would not consent to it in a brothel nay it is a brothel scheme where some of the company retired into another room see through holes cut in the partition the aukward addresses made to a woman by any particular person they mean to laugh atBut how can any thing of the kind be transacted in a reputable house  The lady being left alone and a clear stage for Sir  Callaghan  on he comes and all the reason he gives for his absence is that he was enjoying himself in a soliloquy about her though in the mean time there was a possibility of one of his rivals making advances in her esteem  She allows him but little time to apologize before she asks him for a song not for her entertainment alone but his rival hearers which is a violent proof of the author's knowledge of the behaviour of women of polite education and rank  By the assistance of liquor he thinks himself better enabled to speak his mind to the ladyHe would fain excuse himself from singing a song which she is put on to ask by  M' Sarcasm  and pleads the fear of having  got at the wrong side of his voice but she persisting he prays her not to expect such good singing from him as the people of the operahouse because "  Irishmen  are not cut out like the  Italians  "  This expression I am informed by  Scotch  officers who have been on  Irish  duty is a very old and hackney'd blackguardicism therebut it may be replied that is no exclusive reason against the qualified author's using it  Let other men sing of their goddesses bright  That darken the day and enlighten the night  I sing of woman of such flesh and blood  To touch but her finger would do one's heart good  Fal lal la c  At the end of each stanza is introduced a dash of the  Irish  howl which as  Mordecai  has it he  roars  not  sings  The song finished to the great satisfaction of the three listening rivals in the corner  Charlotte  intimates a desire of her ardent lover O  Brallaghan  's remaining in case of their union at home with her and going no more to the army  He with two thrustin sentiments replies " he cannot with honour because that he had served his royal master and a brave one he is for seventeen years who gave him money when he had none of his own and that now he was come to a title and fortune to desert his service when he stands in most need would be the act of a poltroonthat it had ever been a rule with him never to abandon his king or his friend in distress"  Morality of this kind belongs to the ingenuous and nobleminded of every climate and is here strangely appropriated to  Irish Teaguism  as well as that in the first act" There are two things I am equally afraid of either to affront any man or being affronted myself" and yet the  Irish  in general are remarkable for  irascibility  and mistaking an affront where none had been meant  Is it not surprising that our author who makes the most of every occasion has not given a panegyrical volley to the king of  Prussia  to endear his piece the more to the crowd that would have been some  little plea for the  Irishman  's being a  Prussian  officerHe might have extolled him above  Caesar Hannibal Alexander  and declared them not worthy of being his  aidesdecamp  Then what huzzaing and clapping from the upper regions  The lady declares against having to do with a military man leaves him as abruptly as she had exposed him baselyIn amazement he says "What does she quit the fieldI'll after strait and reconnoitre her"  It being high time for all parties to have done their fools tricks and put a judicious period to this wonderful piece enter  M' Sarcasm  and  Mordecai  observing to each other that the shew is over that there are bailiffs in Sir  Theodore  's house  Sir  Theodore  crosses the stage with an attorney and shews him to the lady's apartment to inform her of the loss of her lawsuitShe comes on in tears with Sir  Theodore  bidding him not to despond but to hope for the better " that she is sure Sir  Archibald  will make them happy"  The  Scot  overhearing her says " She may as well rely on the philosophers stone  Upon her application to him he tells her he has received letters " not only remonstrating but expressly prohibiting his contaminating a noble family by mixing with any thing sprung from sugarhogsheads and countinghouses  She closes her indignant answer with " there is no virtue in man"" Nor in woman either quoth the  Scot  who has na fortune"He insultingly advises her to take up with the wandering Israelite whom he treats with amplified abuse but the Jew begs to be excused  In rushes Squire  Groome  roaring what the devil is the matter" Why I hear Sir  Theodore  that you and the silly have run soul of the post"Being informed of the lady's disaster he plays off too with a continuation of indecent  Newmarket  allegory  On comes Sir  Brallaghan  who when ever off the stage seems as if he had been asleep and not to know any thing of what  has happened in the houseWhere did he so hide himself  When told of  Charlott  's misfortune as it was proper the dubbed hero should he declares that he loves her the better for it because while she was computed to be worth an hundred thousand pounds he could never come near her but in trembling"Is this agreeable to some of his former declarations of attacking storming making a coup de  main  or dying upon the spot or the sense of the song which tags the first act in which he says he and his countrymen always make the fair and the bold surrenderHer sentimental speeches on his behaviour she knowing her situation not to be impaired is quite  gratis  Sir  Theodore  tells Sir  Callaghan  " that to reward his manly virtue and to punish the other interested profligates who court ladies only for their fortunes that  Charlotte  is as rich as ever  Groome  and  Mordecai  appearing amazed  M'Sarcasm  bids them be quiet that Sir  Theodore  says that to take in the  Irish  feul who had three  good qualities to make a husband " a gud estate loved  Charlotte  mightily and was a blockhead  Sir  Callaghan  addressing himself to Sir  Theodore  says" Why really I do not know the importance of all this I cannot believe one word you say one time you tell me Miss  Charlotte  has a fortune then she has no fortuneand after that she has a fortune again why this is like what the little  jackanapes  's about town do and is called  humbugging  a man"  When the reality of  Charlotte  's fortune is assured beyond a doubt the slung rivals express their uneasiness  Groome  cries out " Why the knowingones are taken in here  M'Sarcasm  declares he will be revenged that he knows a lad of gud family that understands the  Belles Lettres  and  Classics  " a stale joke against the  Scots  and is actually writing a comedy and that he shall make the parties ridiculous by insinuating their characters  Mordecai  vows " he will write a satire and ascribe a scandalous intrigue to  Charlotte  "  Groome  to have vengeance swears " as he cannot write he will kill her parrot and cut off her squirrel's tail"  O Brallaghan  accosts them " Pray gentlemen I hope you will ask my leave for all this if any of you touch a hair of the parrot's head or write your scurrilous lampoons I will make remarks upon your bodies I carry a pen by my side that is a very good critic and writes legible characters to punish impertinent authors"  M' Sarcasm  tells him he has the lady and to be satisfied and not to talk in that bullying way for that others have as good swords as he  O Brallaghan  observes to  Charlotte  " This is very like the catastrophe of a play where all the people are together when honest men are  rewarded  and knaves disappointed  Thus ends  Love à la Mode  the prize is carried off by  O Brallaghan  the  Jew Scot  and  Englishman  baulked and abused What  can be the tendency or moral instruction of this piece it is pretty obvious without explaining it  POSTSCRIPT  SHOULD this piece be proved a plagiarism a vampedup old  Irish  farce how must many folks be surprised  Some strollers from  Dublin  brought over to  Edinburgh  a farce where it was printed in the year and is called  The Brave Irishman  The chief business is that Mr  Tradewell  an eminent merchant of the city of  London  has an only child and heiress Miss  Lucy  courted by several woers whereof one is a  Frenchman  Monsiour  Ragou  abused for his tawney complexion as  Mordecai  is in  Love à la Mode Cheatly  a principal agent an  Englishman  is a most worthless rascal lays schemes to defeat the virtuous  Irishman  Captain  O Blunder  's courtship who
