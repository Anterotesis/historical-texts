 ODE BY Dr SAMUEL JOHNSON TO Mrs THRALE  PRICE ONE SHILLING  Entered at Stationers hall  ODE BY DR SAMUEL JOHNSON TO MRS THRALE UPON THEIR SUPPOSED APPROACHING NUPTIALS  Tauri ruentis  In venerem tolerare pondus  HOR  LONDON  PRINTED FOR R FAULDER NEWBONDSTREET M DCC LXXXIV  PREFACE BY THE EDITOR  MR HENRY THRALE brewer in the borough of Southwark I say it without flattery or interested hopes of reward from his surviving relict and daughters was one of the most eminent and opulent traders that England ever had He was moreover a wellbuilt stout man in his person His wife Mrs Hester Lynch whose maiden name was Salusbury was of creditable Welch extraction She was rather a little woman but smart of pregnant parts and some share of booklearning They kept a very plentiful table both for meat and drink to which those who are called  Wits  and also many ingenious artists gladly repaired as to a convenient house of call where they had nothing to pay except their court to Mrs Thrale who doubtless deserved while she was flattered by their compliments The most distinguished of them and as one may say the foreman of the whole was Dr SAMUEL JOHNSON the celebrated Lichfield authour who wrote an English Dictionary and several works of a good moral tendency and was famous besides for shrewd sayings and lively jokes He was a very large man and by no means welllooking but rather the contrary neither was he neat and cleanly in his person and dress He was notwithstanding a  no small favourite with Mrs Thrale both in her husband's lifetime and for some short while after and from a collection of their letters which is extant and has been put forth in print by herself it appears that there was no overdelicate niceness but truly the plainest familiarity between them as witness these and the like passages"I hope in time to be like the great bull" lett "Dr Taylor desires always to have his compliments sent He is in his usual way very busy getting a bull to his cows and a dog to his bitches Old Shakespeare is dead and he wants to buy another horse to his mares" lett "You must take the chance of finding me  better or worse  This you may know at present that my  affection  for you is not diminished and my  expectation  from you is increased" lett "I am harrassed by a very disagreeable operation of the  cantharides  which I am endeavouring to  control  by copious dilution" lett "On the th of last month I evacuated twenty pints of water" lett  Mr Thrale and his wife had a family of five daughters to whom they did not grudge to give every piece of genteel education Signor Baretti was entertained in the house at bed and board to teach them the Italian tongue and Signor Piozzi it is believed was liberally rewarded for teaching them to sing and play on the harpsichord Mrs Thrale had not an  ear  as the saying is but she had an  eye  to this her daughter's musicmaster  who it appears by her said publication was permitted to  love  her "Piozzi I find is coming and when  he  comes and  I  come you will have two about you that  love  you" lett This was in her widowhood and indeed it is plain that Dr Samuel Johnson himself had then also pretensions to her the disappointment of which by her preference of Signor Piozzi whom she afterwards married no doubt contributed with other considerations to his writing that severe answer on her informing him of her resolution which answer she has very prudently suppressed  Indeed recently after the death of Mr Henry Thrale there were not wanting many who conjectured that a matrimonial union would take place between the widow and Dr Samuel Johnson and some went so far as to assert that it was his determined purpose not only to carry on the business under the  firm  of the brewery but even to assume the name and arms of Thrale Upon this foundation and no better the bellman or some other such rhymster of the Borough bantered the business in the following homely lines  Hail Johnson  Thrale Johnson  Brewer of good ale Johnson  While thus you drive so bold a trade  Your cash will never sail Johnson  Though Madam's somewhat stale Johnson  You'll find she'll yet be frail Johnson  For many years she tried your head  And now she'll try Johnson  Whether it was that a copy of this balderdash reached Dr Samuel Johnson and made him anxious lest posterity should look upon his tender passion as of a very coarse and vulgar nature or whether he was merely incited by her blandishments to give a specimen of his juvenile vivacity or from whatever other cause it would seem that in the confidence of their being speedily joined in marriage he sent her the following wedding verses of which it is probable she gave a copy to Signor Baretti or to some other person with whom she at that time was intimate  The same having by some strange chance fallen into my hands I thought I could not do better than lay them before the publick  With respect to their being certainly written by Dr Samuel Johnson I honestly confess I am no judge of such matters and therefore will not pretend to say any thing of my own knowledge upon that head But I am well assured by a person of skill that they have the undoubted sterling mark and that no other man in the kingdom could make them but himself  ARGUMENT  THE Poet pleased with the reminiscence of his poetical powers prepares to concentrate them in his MistressHe prostrates his dignity to her in versatility of characterPlumes himself on his fancied felicity and by a bold image equal to any in Anacreon at once personifies and personates that Beer which was the glory of her houseTouches on his jealousy of Signor PiozziExults in his supposed victory over his rivalDescribes the congratulations on the nuptials between him and his dearest dear lady but characteristically hints at the malignity of human natureRepresents the envy with which their happiness is beheldWeary of continence solaces himself with the prospect of future enjoymentPaints it with vigorous strokes and glowing coloursTakes care to give it the delicate sanction of sentimentAssumes a reflex honour by projecting illustrious matches for his lady's daughters by her first husband but maintains his own superiority by figuring himself the father of an heir maleConcludes in mythological enthusiasm that he is greater than Atlas  ODE  IF e'er my fingers touch'd the lyre  In satire fierce in pleasure gay  Shall not my THRALIA'S smiles inspire  Shall SAM refuse the sportive lay  My dearest lady view your slave  Behold him as your very SCRUB  Eager to write as authour grave  Or govern well the brewing tub  To rich felicity thus rais'd  My bosom glows with amorous fire  Porter no longer shall be prais'd  'Tis I MYSELF am  Thrale's Entire  PIOZZI once alarm'd my fears  Till beauteous MARY'S tragick fate  And RIZZIO'S tale dissolv'd in tears  My mistress ere it was too late  Indignant thought to English pride  That any eye should ever see  JOHNSON one moment set aside  For  Tweedledum  or  Tweedledee  Congratulating crowds shall come  Our newborn happiness to hail  Whether at ball at rout at drum  But human spite will still prevail  For though they come in pleasing guise  And cry "The wise deserve the fair"  They look askance with envious eyes  As Satan look'd at the first pair  Ascetick now thy lover lives  Nor dares to touch nor dares to kiss  Yet prurient fancy sometimes gives  A prelibation of our bliss  Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws  We feel the aphrodisian spasm  Tir'd nature must at last repose  Then Wit and Wisdom fill the chasm  Nor only are our limbs entwin'd  And lip in rapture glued to lip  Lock'd in embraces of the mind  Imagination's sweets we sip  Five daughters by a former spouse  Shall match with nobles of the land  The fruit of our more fervent vows  A pillar of the state shall stand  Greater than Atlas was of yore  A nobler charge to me is given  The sphere he on his shoulders bore  I with my arms encircle Heaven  THE END
