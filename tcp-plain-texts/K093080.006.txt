rivulets are addressed at daybreak in honour of their several functions and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world Their origin is deduced from the first allegorical deities or powers of nature according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets concerning the generation of the Gods and the rise of things They are then successively considered as giving motion to the air and exciting summerbreezes as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable world as contributing to the fulness of navigable rivers and consequently to the main+tenance of commerce and by that means to the maritime part of military power Next is represented their favourable influence upon health when assisted by rural exercise which introduces their connection with the art of physic and the happy effects of mineral medicinal springs Lastly they are celebrated for the friendship which the Muses bear them and for the true inspiration which temperance only can receive in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more licentious poets  HYMN TO THE NAIADS  O'ER yonder eastern hill the twilight throws  Her dusky mantle and the God of day  With bright Astraea seated by his side  Waits yet to leave the ocean Tarry Nymphs  Ye Nymphs ye blueey'd progeny of Thames  Who now the mazes of this rugged heath  Trace with your fleeting steps who all night long  Repeat amid the cool and tranquil air  Your lonely murmurs tarry and receive  My offer'd lay To pay you homage due  I leave the gates of sleep nor shall my lyre  Too far into the splendid hours of morn  Ingage your audience my observant hand  Shall close the strain ere any sultry beam  Approach you To your subterranean haunts  Ye then may timely steal to pace with care  The humid sands to loosen from the soil  The bubbling sources to direct the rills  To meet in wider channels or beneath  Some grotto's dripping arch at height of noon  To slumber shelter'd from the burning heaven  Where shall my song begin ye Nymphs or end  Wide is your praise and copiousFirst of things  First of the lonely powers ere Time arose  Were Love    Love    Elder than Chaos  Hesiod in his Theogony gives a different account and makes Chaos the eldest of beings though he assigns to Love neither father nor superior which circumstance is particularly mentioned by Phaedrus in Plato's Banquet as being observable not only in Hesiod but in all other writers both in verse and prose and on the same occasion he cites a line from Parmenides in which Love is expressly styled the eldest of all the gods Yet Aristophanes in The Birds affirms that  Chaos and Night and Erebus and Tartarus were first and that Love was produced from an egg which the sablewinged night deposited in the immense bosom of Erebus  But it must be observed that the Love designed by this comic poet was always distinguished from the other from that original and selfexistent being the  or  of Plato and meant only the  or second person of the old Grecian trinity to whom is inscribed an hymn among those which pass under the name of Orpheus where he is called Protogonos or the firstbegotten is said to have been born of an egg and is represented as the principal or origin of all these external appearances of nature In the fragments of Orpheus collected by Henry Stephens he is named Phanes the discoverer or discloser who unfolded the ideas of the supreme intelligence and exposed them to the perception of inferior beings in this visible frame of the world as Macrobius and Proclus and Athenagoras all agree to interpret the several passages of Orpheus which they have preserved  But the Love designed in our text is the one selfexistent and infinite mind whom if the generality of ancient mythologists have not introduced or truly described in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances yet to a modern poet it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this particular though in other respects he professeth to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions For in these great points of natural theology they differ no less remarkably among themselves and are perpetually confounding the philosophical relations of things with the traditionary circumstances of mythic history upon which very account Calsimachus in his Hymn to Jupiter declareth his dissent from them concerning even an article of the national creed adding that the ancient bards were by no means to be depended on And yet in the exordium of the old Argonautic poem ascribed to Orpheus it is said that  Love whom mortals in later times call Phanes was the father of the eternally begotten Night  who is generally represented by these mythological poets as being herself the parent of all things and who in the Indigitamenta or Orphic Hymns is said to be the same with Cypris or Love itself Moreover in the body of this Argonautic poem where the personated Orpheus introduceth himself singing to his lyre in reply to Chiron he celebrateth  the obscure memory of Chaos and the natures which it contained within itself in a state of perpetual vicissitude how the heaven had its boundary determined the generation of the earth the depth of the ocean and also the sapient Love the most ancient the selfsufficient with all the beings which he produced when he separated one thing from another  Which noble passage is more directly to Aristotle's purpose in the first book of his metaphysics than any of those which he has there quoted to shew that the ancient poets and mythologists agreed with Empedocles Anaxagoras and the other more sober philosophers in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind concerning the necessity of mind and reason to account for the connexion motion and good order of the world For though neither this poem nor the hymns which pass under the same name are it should seem the work of the real Orpheus yet beyond all question they are very ancient The hymns more particularly are allowed to be older than the invasion of Greece by Xerxes and were probably a felt of public and solemn forms of devotion as appears by a passage in one of them which Demosthenes hath almost literally cited in his first oration against Aristogiton as the saying of Orpheus the founder of their most holy mysteries On this account they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant the Theogony of Hesiod himself not excepted The poetry of them is often extremely noble and the mysterious air which prevails in them together with its delightful impression upon the mind cannot be better expressed than in that remarkable description with which they inspired the German edition Eschenbach when he accidentally met with them at Leipsic "Thesaurum me reperisse credidi" says he  prosecto thesaurum reperi Incredibile dictu quo me sacro horrore afflaverint indigitamenta ista deorum nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar quod vel solum horrorem incutere animo potest nocturnum cum enim totam diem consumserim in contemplando urbis splendore in adeundis quibus scatet urbs illa viris doctis sola nox restabat quam Orpheo consecrare potui In abyssum quendam mysteriorum venerandae antiquitatis descendere videbar quotiescunque silente mundo solis vigilantibus astris et luna  istos hymnos ad manus sumsi  and Chaos  Chaos  The unformed undigested mass of Moses and Plato which Milton calls  "The womb of nature"  Love the sire of Fate  Love the sire of Fate  Fate is the universal system of natural causes the work of the Omnipotent Mind or of Love so Minudius Felix  Quid aliud est fatum quam quod de unoquoque nostrum deus fatus est  So also Cicero in The First Book on Divination  Fatum autem id appello quod  Graeci  EIPMAPMENHN id est ordinem seriemque causarum cum causa causae nexa rem ex se gignatex quo intelligitur ut fatum sit non id quod superstitiose sed id quod physice dicitur causa aeterna rerum  To the same purpose is the doctrine of Hierocles in that excellent fragment concerning Providence and Destiny As to the three Fates or Destinies of the poets they represented that part of the general system of natural causes which relates to man and to other mortal beings for so we are told in the hymn addressed to them among the Orphic Indigitamenta where they are called the daughters of Night or Love and contrary to the vulgar notion are distinguished by the epithet of gentle and tenderhearted According to Hesiod Theog ver they were the daughers of Jupiter and Themis but in the Orphic Hymn to Venus or Love that Goddess is directly stiled the mother of Necessity and is represented immediately after as governing the three Destinies and conducting the whole system of natural causes    Elder than Chaos Born of Fate was Time  Born of Fate was Time  Cronos Saturn or Time was according to Apollodorus the son of Coelum and Tellus But the author of the hymns gives it quite undisguised by mythological language and calls him plainly the offspring of the earth and the starry heaven that is of Fate as explained in the preceding note    Who many sons  Who many sons devour'd  The known fable of Saturn devouring his children was certainly meant to imply the dissolution of natural bodies which are produced and destroyed by Time  and many comely births  Devour'd relentless father 'till the child  Of Rhea  The child of Rea  Jupiter so called by Pindar  drow him from the upper sky  Drove him from the upper sky  That Jupiter dethroned his father Saturn is recorded by all the mythologists Phurnutus or Cornutus the author of a little Greek treatise on the nature of the gods informs us that by Jupiter was meant the vegetable soul of the world which restrained and prevented those uncertain alterations which Saturn or Time used formerly to cause in the mundane system  And quell'd his deadly might Then social reign'd  Then social reign'd  Our mythology here supposeth thát before the establishment of the vital vegetative plastic nature represented by Jupiter the four elements were in a variable and unsettled condition but afterwards welldisposed and at peace among themselves Tethys was the wife of the Ocean Ops or Rhea the Earth Vesta the eldest daughter of Saturn Fire and the cloudcompeller or  the Air though he also represented the plastic principle of nature as may be seen in the Orphic hymn inscribed to him  The kindred powers Tethys and reverend Ops  And spotless Vesta while supreme of sway  Remain'd the cloudcompeller From the couch  Of Tethys sprang the sedgycrowned race  The sedgycrowned race  The rivergods who according to Hesiod's Theogony were the sons of Oceanus and Tethys    Who from a thousand urns o'er every clime  Send tribute to their parent and from them  Are ye O Naiads  From them are ye O Naiads  The descent of the Naiads is less certain than most points of the Greek mythology Homer Odyss xiii  Virgil in the eighth book of the Aeneid speaks as if the Nymphs or Naiads were the parents of the rivers but in this he contradicts the testimony of Hesiod and evidently departs from the orthodox system which representeth several nymphs as retaining to every single river On the other hand Calimachus who was very learned in all the schooldivinity of those times in his hymns to Delos maketh Peneus the great Thessalian rivergod the father of his nymphs and Ovid in the fourteenth book of his Metamorphoses mentions the Naiads of Latium as the immediate daughters of the neighbouring river gods Accordingly the Naiads of particular rivers are occasionally both by Ovid and Statius called by a patronymic from the name of the river to which they belong  Arethusa fair  And tuneful Aganippe that sweet name  Bandusia that soft family which dwelt  With Syrian Daphne  Syrian Daphne  The grove of Daphne in Syria near Antioch was famous for its delightful fountains  and the honour'd tribes  Belov'd of Paeon  The tribes belov'd by Paeon  Mineral and medicinal springs Paeon was the physician of the gods  Listen to my strain  Daughters of Tethys listen to your praise  You Nymphs the winged offspring  The winged offspring  The Winds who according to Hesiod and Apollodorus were the sons of Astraeus and Aurora  which of old  Aurora to divine Astraeus bore  Owns and your aid beseecheth When the might  Of Hyperion  Hyperion  A son of Coelum and Tellus and father of the Sun who is thence called by Pindar Hyperionides But Hyperíon is put by Homer in the same manner as here for the Sun himself  from his noontide throne  Unbends their languid pinions aid from you  They ask Favonius and the mild Southwest  From you relief implore Your sallying streams  Your sallying streams  The state of the atmosphere with respect to rest and motion is in several ways affected by rivers and running streams and that more especially in hot seasons first they destroy its equilibrium by cooling those parts of it with which they are in contact and secondly they communicate their own motion and the air which is thus moved by them being left heated is of consequence more elastic than other parts of the atmosphere and therefore fitter to preserve and to propagate that motion  Fresh vigour to their weary limbs impart  Again they fly disporting from their mead  Halfripen'd and the tender blades of corn  To sweep the noxious mildew or dispel  Contagious steams which oft the parched earth  Breathes on her fainting sons From noon to eve  Along the river and the paved brook  Ascend the cheerful breezes hail'd of bards  Who fast by learned Cam the Mantuan lyre  Sollicit nor unwelcome to the youth  Who on the heights of Tybur all inclin'd  O'er rushing Anio with a pious hand  The reverend scene delineates broken fanes  Or tombs or pillar'd aqueducts the pomp  Of ancient Time and haply while he scans  The ruins with a silent tear revolves  The fame and fortune of imperious Rome  You too O Nymphs and your unenvious aid  The rural powers confess and still prepare  For you their grateful treasures Pan commands  Oft as the Delian king  Delian king  One of the epithets of Apollo or the Sun in the Orphic hymn inscribed to him  with Sirius holds  The central heavens the father of the grove  Commands his Dryads over your abodes  To spread their deepest umbrage Well the God  Remembereth how indulgent ye supplied  Your genial dews to nurse them in their prime  Pales the pasture's queen where'er ye stray  Pursues your steps delighted and the path  With living verdure clothes Around your haunts  The laughing Chloris  Chloris  The ancient Greek name for Flora  with profusest hand  Throws wide her blooms her odours Still with you  Pomona seeks to dwell and o'er the lawns  And o'er the vale of Richmond where with Thames  Ye love to wander Amalthea  Amalthea  The mother of the first Bacchus whose birth and education was written as Diodorus Siculus informs us in the old Pelasgic character by Thymoetes grandson to Laomedon and contemporary with Orpheus Thymoetes had traveled over Libya to the country which borders on the western ocean there he saw the island of Nysa and learned from the inhabitants that  Ammon king of Lybia was married in former ages to Rhea sister of Saturn and the Titans that he afterwards fell in love with a beautiful virgin whose name was Amalthea had by her a son and gave her posession of a neighbouring tract of land wonderfully fertile which in shape nearly resembling the horn of an ox was thence called the Hesperian horn and afterwards the horn of Amalthea that fearing the jealousy of Rhea he concealed the young Bacchus with his mother in the island of Nysa  the beauty of which Diodorus describes with great dignity and pomp of style This fable is one of the noblest in all the ancient mythology and seems to have made a particular impression on the imagination of Milton the only modern poet unless perhaps it be necessary to except Spenser who in these mysterious traditions of the poetic story had a heart to feel and words to express the simple and solitary genius of antiquity To raise the idea of his Paradise he prefers it even to  "that Nysean isle  "Girt by the river Triton where old Cham  "Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove  "Hid Amalthea and her florid son  "Young Bacchus from his stepdame Rhea's eye  pours  Wellpleas'd the wealth of that Ammonian horn

As down the verdant slope your duteous rills  Descend the tribute stately Thames receives  Delighted and your piety applauds  And bids his copious tide roll on secure  For faithful are his daughters

Hermes  When Hermes  Hermes or Mercury was the patron of commerce in which benevolent character he is addressed by the author of Indigitamenta in these beautiful lines      from Olympus bent o'er earth  To bear the words of Jove on yonder hill  Stoops lightlysailing oft intent your springs  He views and waving o'er some newborn stream  His blest pacific wand "And yet" he cries  "Yet" cries the

frequent in your praise  Abash the frantic Thyrsus  Thyrsus  A staff or spear wreathed round with ivy of constant use in the bacchanalian mysteries  with my song  For not estrang'd from your benignant arts  Is he the God to whose mysterious shrine  My youth was sacred and my votive cares  Are due the learned Paeon Oft when all  His cordial treasures he hath search'd in vain  When herbs and potent trees and drops of balm  Rich with the genial influence of the sun  To rouze dark fancy from her plaintive dreams  To brace the nerveless arm with food to win  Sick appetite or hush the unquiet breast  Which pines with silent passion he in vain  Hath prov'd to your deep mansions he descends  Your gates of humid rock your dim arcades  He entereth where impurpled veins of ore  Gleam on the roof where through the rigid mine  Your trickling rills insinuate There the God  From your indulgent hands the streaming bowl  Wafts to his paleey'd suppliants wafts the seeds  Metallic and the elemental salts  Wash'd from the pregnant glebe They drink and soon  Flies pain flies inauspicious care and soon  The social haunt or unfrequented shade  Hears Io Io Paean  Io Paean  An exclamation of victory and

atoms and with all  Your healing powers inform the recent wave  My lyre shall pay your bounty Nor disdain  That humble tribute Though a mortal hand  Excite the strings to utterance yet for themes  Not unregarded of coelestial powers  I frame their language and the Muses deign  To guide the pious tenour of my lay  The Muses sacred by their gifts divine  In early days did to my wondering sense  Their secrets oft reveal oft my rais'd ear  In slumber felt their music oft at noon  Or hour of sunset by some lonely stream  In field or shady grove they taught me words  Of power from death and envy to preserve  The good man's name Whence yet with grateful mind  And offerings unprofan'd by ruder eye  My vows I send my homage to the seats  Of rocky Cirrha  Cirrha  One of the summits of Parnassus and sacred to Apollo Near it were several fountains said to be frequented by the Muses Nysa the other eminence of the same mountain was dedicated to Bacchus  where with you they dwell  Where you their chafte companions they admit  Through all the hallow'd scene where oft intent  And leaning o'er Castalia's mossy verge  They mark the cadence of your confluent urns  How tuneful yielding gratefullest repose  To their consorted measure 'till again  With emulation all the sounding choir  And bright Apollo leader of the song  Their voices through the liquid air exalt  And sweep their lofty strings those aweful strings  That charm the minds of Gods  Charm the minds of gods  This whole passage concerning the effects of sacred music among the gods is taken from Pindar's first Pythian ede  that fill the courts  Of wide Olympus with oblivion sweet  Of evils with immortal rest from cares  Assuage the terrours of the throne of Jove  And quench the formidable thunderbolt  Of unrelenting fire With slacken'd wings  While now the solemn concert breathes around  Incumbent o'er the sceptre of his lord  Sleeps the stern eagle by the number'd notes  Posses'd and satiate with the melting tone  Sovereign of birds The furious God of war  His darts forgetting and the rapid wheels  That bear him vengeful o'er the embattled plain  Relents and sooths his own fierce heart to ease  Unwonted ease The fire of Gods and men  In that great moment of divine delight  Looks down on all that live and whatsoe'er  He loves not o'er the peopled earth and o'er  The interminated ocean he beholds  Curs'd with abhorrence by his doom severe  And troubled at the sound Ye Naiads ye  With ravish'd ears the melody attend  Worthy of sacred silence But the slaves  Of Bacchus with tempestuous clamours strive  To drown the heavenly strains of highest Jove  Irreverent and by mad presumption fir'd  Their own discordant raptures to advance  With hostile emulation Down they rush  From Nysa's vineimpurpled cliff the dames  Of Thrace the Satyrs and the unruly Fauns  With old Silenus through the midnight gloom  Tossing the torch impure and high in air  The brandish'd Thyrsus to the Phrygian pipe's  Phrygian pipe's  The Phrygian music was fantastic and turbulent and fit to excite disorderly passions  Shrill voice and to the clashing cymbals mix'd  With shrieks and frantic uproar May the Gods  From every unpolluted ear avert  Their orgies If within the seats of men  Within the seats of men the walls the gates  Which Pallas rules  Which Pallas rules  It was the office of Minerva to be the guardian of walled cities whence she was named  and  and had her statues placed in their gates being supposed to keep the keys and on that account stiled    if haply there be found  Who loves to mingle with the

description  Between Delphi and the eminences of Parnassus is a road to the grotto of Corycium which has its name from the nymph Corycia and is by far the most remarkable which I have seen One may walk a great way into it without a torch It is of a considerable height and hath several springs within it and yet a much greater quantity of water distills from the shell and roof so as to be continually dropping on the ground The people round Parnassus hold it sacred to the Corycian nymphs and to Pan  or the Delphic mount  Delphic mount  Delphi the seat and oracle of Apollo had a

Cyrenaïc  Cyrenaïc  Cyrene was the native country of Callimachus whose hymns are the most remarkable example of that mythological passion which is assumed in the preceding poem and have always afforded particular pleasure to the author of it by reason of the mysterious solemnity with which they affect the mind On this account he was induced to attempt somewhat in the same manner solely by way of exercise the manner itself being now almost intirely abandoned in poetry And as the meer genealogy or the personal adventures of heathen gods could have been but little interesting to a modern reader it was therefore thought proper to select some convenient part of the history of nature and to employ these ancient divinities as it is probable they were first employed to wit in personifying natural causes and in representing the mutual agreement or opposition of the corporeal and moral powers of the world which hath been accounted the very highest office of poetry  shell  Behold I touch

shall the baser notes to Celtic kings  By lying minstrels paid in evil hour  Move Thee to spurn the heavenly Muse's reign  A different strain  And other Themes  From her prophetic shades and hallow'd streams  Thou well canst witness meet the purged ear  Such as when Greece to her immortal shell  Rejoicing listen'd godlike sounds to hear  To hear the sweet instructress tell  While men and heroes throng'd around  How life its noblest use may find  How best for freedom be resign'd  And how by glory virtue shall be crown'd  II  Such was the  Homer  Chian father's strain  To many a kind domestic train  Whose pious hearth and genial bowl  Had cheer'd the reverend pilgrim's soul  When every hospitable rite  With equal bounty to requite  He struck his magic strings  And pour'd spontaneous numbers forth  And seiz'd their ears with tales of ancient worth  And fill'd their musing hearts with vast heroic things  II  Now oft where happy spirits dwell  Where yet he tunes his charming shell

decisive battle between the Persian army and the united militia of Greece under Pausanias and AristidesCimon the Athenian erected a trophy in Cyprus for two great victories gained on the same day over the Persians by sea and land Diodorus Siculus has preserved the inscription which the Athenians affixed to the consecrated spoils' after this great success in which it is very remarkable that the greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of expression above the usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient inscriptions It is this                  The following translation is almost literal  Since first the sea from Asia's hostile coast  Divided Europe and the god of war  Assail'd imperious cities never yet  At once among the waves and on the shore  Hath such a labour been atchiev'd by men  Who earth inhabit They whose arms the Medes  In Cyprus felt pernicious they the same  Have won from skilful Tyre an hundred ships  Crouded with warriors Asia groans in both  Her

page  Exulting Pindar  Pindar was contemporary with Aristides and Cymon in whom the glory of ancient Greece was at his height When Xerxes invaded Greece Pindar was true to the common interest of his country though his fellowcitizens the Thebans had sold themselves to the Persian king In one of his odes he expresses the great distress and anxiety of his mind occasioned by the vast preparations of Xerxes against Greece Isthm In another he celebrates the victories of Salamis Plata and Himera Pyth It will be necessary to add two or three other particulars of his life real or fabulous in order to explain what follows in the next concerning him First then he was thought to be so great a favourite of Apollo that the priests of that deity allotted him a constant share of their offerings It was said of him as of some other illustrious men that at his birth a swarm of bees lighted on his lips and fed him with their honey It was also a tradition concerning him that Pan was heard to recite his poetry and seen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near Thebes But a real historical fact in his life is that the Thebans imposed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expressed in his poems for that heroic spirit shewn by the people of Athens in defence of the common liberty which his own fellowcitizens had shamefully betrayed And as the argument of this ode implies that  great poetical talents and high sentiments of liberty do reciprocally produce and assist each other  so Pindar is perhaps the most exemplary proof of this connection which occurs in history The Thebans were remarkable in general for a slavish disposition through all the fortunes of their commonwealth at the time of its ruin by Philip and even in its best state under the administration of Pelopidas and Epaminondas and every one knows they were no less remarkable for great dulness and want of all genius That Pindar should have equally distinguished himself from the rest of his fellowcitizens in both these respects seems somewhat extraordinary and is scarce to be accounted for but by the preceding observation  saw to full perfection brought  O Pindar oft shalt thou be hail'd of me  Not that Apollo fed thee from his shrine  Not that thy lips drank sweetness from the bee  Nor yet that studious of thy notes divine  Pan danc'd their measure with the sylvan throng  But that thy song  Was proud to unfold  What thy base rulers trembled to behold  Amid corrupted Thebes was proud to tell  The deeds of Athens and the Persian shame  Hence on thy head their impious vengeance fell  But thou O faithful to thy fame  The Muse's law didst rightly know  That who would animate his lays  And other minds to virtue raise  Must feel his own with all her spirit glow  III  Are there approv'd of later times  Whose verse adorn'd a  Octavius Caesar  tyrant's crimes  Who saw majestic Rome betray'd  And lent the imperial ruffian aid  Alas not one polluted bard  No not the strains that Mincius heard  Or Tibur's hills reply'd  Dare to the Muse's ear aspire  Save that instructed by the Grecian lyre  With freedom's ancient notes their shameful task they hide  III  Mark how the dread Pantheon stands  Amid the domes of modern hands  Amid the toys of idle state  How simply how severely great  Then turn and while each western clime  Presents her tuneful sons to Time  So mark thou Milton's name  And add "Thus differs from the throng  "The spirit which inform'd thy aweful song  "Which bade thy potent voice protect thy country's fame"  III  Yet hence barbaric zeal  His memory with unholy rage pursues  While from these arduous cares of public weal  She bids each bard be gone and rest him with his Muse  O fool to think the man whose ample mind  Must grasp at all that yonder stars survey  Must join the noblest forms of every kind  The world's most perfect image to display  Can e'er his country's majesty behold  Unmov'd or cold  O fool to deem  That He whose thought must visit every theme  Whose heart must every strong emotion know  By nature planted or by fortune taught  That He if haply some presumptuous foe  With false ignoble science fraught  Shall spurn at freedom's faithful band  That He their dear defence will shun  Or hide their glories from the sun  Or deal their vengeance with a woman's hand  Alluding to his "Defence of the people of England" against Salmafius See particularly the manner in which he himself speaks of that undertaking in the introduction to his reply to Morus    IV  I care not that in Arno's plain  Or on the sportive banks of Seine  From public themes the Muse's quire  Content with polish'd ease retire  Where priests the studious head command  Where tyrants bow the warlike hand  To vile ambition's aim  Say what can public themes afford  Save venal honours to an hateful lord  Reserv'd for angry heaven and scorn'd of honest fame  IV  But here where freedom's equal throne  To all her valiant sons is known  Where all are conscious of her cares  And each the power that rules him shares  Here let the bard whose dastard tongue  Leaves public arguments unsung  Bid public praise farewel  Let him to fitter climes remove  Far from the heroe's and the patriot's love  And lull mysterious monks to slumber in their cell  IV  O Hastings not to all  Can ruling heav'n the same endowments lend  Yet still doth nature to her offspring call  That to one general weal their different powers they bend  Unenvious Thus alone though strains divine  Inform the bosom of the Muse's son  Though with new honours the patrician's line  Advance from age to age yet thus alone  They win the suffrage of impartial fame  The poet's name  He best shall prove  Whose lays the soul with noblest passions move  But thee O progeny of heroes old  Thee to severer toils thy fate requires  The fate which form'd thee in a chosen mould  The grateful country of thy sires  Thee to sublimer paths demand  Sublimer than thy sires could trace

determin'd zeal  To quell that servile band who kneel  To freedom's banish'd foes  That monster which is daily found  Expert and bold thy country's peace to wound  Yet dreads to handle arms nor manly counsel knows  V  'Tis highest heaven's command  That guilty aims should sordid paths pursue  That what ensnares the heart should curb the hand  And virtue's worthless foes be false to glory to    But

his gate  And shew to strangers passing down the vale  Where Candish Booth and Osborne sate  At Whittington a village on the edge of Scarsdale in Derbyshire the Earls of Devonshire and Danby with the Lord Delamere privately concerted the plan of the Revolution The house at which they met is at present a farmhouse and the country people distinguish the room where they sat by the name of "the

laws this publice care  Which Nassau gave us all to share  Had ne'er adorn'd the English name  Could fear have silenc'd freedom's claim  But fear in vain attempts to bind  Those lofty efforts of the mind  Which social good inspires  Where men for this assault a throne  Each adds the common welfare to his own  And each unconquer'd heart the strength of all acquires  VI  Say was it thus when late we view'd  Our fields in civil blood imbrued  When fortune crown'd the barbarous host  And half the astonish'd isle was lost  Did one of all that vaunting train  Who dare affront a peaceful reign  Durst one in arms appear  Durst one in counsels pledge his life  Stake his luxurious fortunes in the strife  Or lend his boasted name his vagrant friends to cheer  VI  Yet HASTINGS these are they  Who challenge to themselves thy country's love  The true the constant who alone can weigh  What glory should demand or liberty approve  But let their works declare them Thy free powers  The generous

field  But sink for ever in oblivion cast  Dishonest triumphs and ignoble spoils  Minturnae's Marsh severely paid at last  The guilty glories gain'd in civil broils  Nor yet his vain contempt the Muse shall praise  For scenes of polish'd life and letter'd worth  The steelribb'd Warrior wants not Envy's ways  To darken theirs or call his merits forth  Witness yon Cimbrian TrophiesMarius there  Thy ample pinion found a space to fly  As the plum'd eagle soaring sails in air  In upper air and scorns a middle sky  Thence too thy country claim'd thee for her own  And bade the Sculptor's toil thy acts adorn  To teach in characters of living stone  Eternal lessons to the youth unborn  For wisely Rome her warlike Sons rewards  With the sweet labours of her Artists' hands  He wakes her Graces who her empire guards  And both Minervas join in willing bands  O why Britannia why untrophied pass  The patriot deeds thy godlike Sons display  Why breathes on high no monumental brass  Why swells no Arc to grace Culloden's Day  Wait we 'till faithless France submissive bow  Beneath that Hero's delegated spear  Whose lightning smote Rebellion's haughty brow  And scatter'd her vile rout with horror in the rear  O Land of Freedom Land of Arts assume  That graceful dignity thy merits claim  Exalt thy Heroes like imperial Rome  And build their virtues on their love of fame  So shall the modest worth which checks my friend  Forget its blush when rous'd by Glory's charms  From breast to breast the generous warmth descend  And still new trophies rise at once to Arts and Arms  ELEGY V To a FRIEND Sick Written at ROME  'TWAS in this  The insula Tiberina where there are still some small remains of the famous temple of Aesculapius  isle O Wright indulge my lay  Whose naval form divides the Tuscan flood  In the bright dawn of her illustrious day  Rome fix'd her Temple to the healing God  Here stood his altars here his arm he bar'd  And round his mystic staff the serpent twin'd  Through crowded portals hymns of praise were heard  And victims bled and sacred seers divin'd  On every breathing wall on every round  Of column swelling with proportion'd grace  Its stated seat some votive tablet found  And storied wonders dignified the place  Oft from the balmy blessings of repose  And the cool stillness of the night's deep shade  To light and health th' exulting Votarist rose  Whilst fancy work'd with med'cine's powerful aid  Oft in his dreams no longer clogg'd with fears  Of some broad torrent or some headlong steep  With each dire form Imagination wears  When harrass'd Nature sinks in turbid sleep  Oft in his dreams he saw diffusive day  Through bursting glooms its cheerful beams extend  On billowy clouds saw sportive Genii play  And bright Hygeia from her heaven descend  What marvel then that man's o'erflowing mind  Should wreathbound columns raise and altars fair  And grateful offerings pay to Powers so kind  Though fancyform'd and creatures of the Air  Who that has writh'd beneath the scourge of pain  Or felt the burthen'd languor of disease  But would with joy the slightest respite gain  And idolize the hand which lent him ease  To thee my friend unwillingly to thee  For truths like these the anxious Muse appeals  Can Memory answer from affliction free  Or speaks the sufferer what I fear he feels  No let me hope ere this in Romely grove  Hygeia revels with the blooming Spring  Ere this the vocal seats the Muses love  With hymns of praise like Paeon's temple ring  It was not written in the book of Fate  That wand'ring far from Albion's seagirt plain  Thy distant Friend should mourn thy shorter date  And tell to alien woods and streams his pain  It was not written Many a year shall roll  If aught th' inspiring Muse aright presage  Of blameless intercourse from Soul to Soul  And friendship well matur'd from Youth to Age  ELEGY VI To another FRIEND Written at ROME  BEHOLD my friend to this small  The medal of Marcus Aurelius  orb confin'd  The genuine features of Aurelius' face  The father friend and lover of his kind  Shrunk to a narrow coin's contracted space  Not so his fame for erst did heaven ordain  Whilst seas should waft us and whilst suns should warm  On tongues of men the friend of man should reign  And in the arts he lov'd the patron charm  Oft as amidst the mould'ring spoils of Age  His mossgrown monuments my steps pursue  Oft as my eye revolves the historic page  Where pass his generous acts in fair review  Imagination grasps at many things  Which men which angels might with rapture see  Then turns to humbler scenes its safer wings  And blush not whilst I speak it thinks on thee  With all that firm benevolence of mind  Which pities whilst it blames th' unfeeling vain  With all that active zeal to serve mankind  That tender suffering for another's pain  Why wert not thou to thrones imperial rais'd  Did heedless Fortune slumber at thy birth  Or on thy virtues with indulgence gaz'd  And gave her grandeurs to her sons of earth  Happy for thee whose less distinguish'd sphere  Now cheers in private the delighted eye  For calm Content and smiling Ease are there  And Heav'n's divinest gift sweet Liberty  Happy for me on life's serener flood  Who sail by talents as by choice restrain'd  Else had I only shar'd the general good  And lost the friend the Universe had gain'd  THE LYRIC MUSE TO MR MASON On the Recovery of the RIGHT HONOURABLE the EARL of HOLDERNESSE from a dangerous Illness  BY THE SAME  MASON snatch the votive Lyre  D'Arcy lives and I inspire  'Tis the Muse that deigns to ask  Can thy hand forget its task  Or can the Lyre its strains refuse  To the Patron of the Muse  Hark what notes of artless love  The feather'd poets of the grove  Grateful for the bowers they fill  Warble wild on Sion hill  In tuneful tribute duly paid  To the Master of the shade  And shall the Bard sit fancyproof  Beneath the hospitable roof  Where every menial face affords  Raptur'd thoughts that want but words  And the Patron's dearer part  The gentle sharer of his heart  Wears her wonted charms again  Time that felt Affliction's chain  Learns on lighter wings to move  And the tender pledge of love  Sweet Amelia now is prest  With double transport to her breast  Sweet Amelia thoughtless why  Imitates the general joy  Innocent of care or guile  See the lovely Mimic smile  And as the heartfelt raptures rise  Catch them from her Mother's eyes  Does the noisy town deny  Soothing airs and extasy  Sion's shades afford retreat  Thither bend thy pilgrim feet  There bid th' imaginary train  Coinage of the Poet's brain  Not only in effects appear  But forms and limbs and features wear  Let festive Mirth with flow'rets crown'd  Lightly tread the measur'd round  And Peace that seldom knows to share  The Statesman's friendly bowl be there  While rosy Health superior guest  Loose to the Zephyrs bares her breast  And to add a sweeter grace  Give her soft Amelia's face  Mason why this dull delay  Haste to Sion haste away  There the Muse again shall ask  Nor thy hand forget its task  Nor the Lyre its strains refuse  To the Patron of the Muse  ON THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL TRANSLATED From the LATIN of ISAAC HAWKINS BROWNE  Esq  BY SOAME JENNYNS  Esq  BOOK I  TO all inferior animals 'tis given  T' enjoy the state allotted them by Heaven  No vain researches e'er disturb their rest  No fears of dark futurity molest  Man only Man solicitous to know  The springs whence Nature's operations flow  Plods through a dreary waste with toil and pain  And reasons hopes and thinks and lives in vain  For sable Death still hov'ring o'er his head  Cuts short his progress with his vital thread  Wherefore since Nature errs not do we find  These seeds of Science in the human mind  If no congenial fruits are predesign'd  For what avails to man this power to roam  Through ages past and ages yet to come  T' explore new worlds o'er all th' aetherial way  Chain'd to a spot and living but a day  Since all must perish in one common grave  Nor can these long laborious searches save  Were it not wiser far supinely laid  To sport with Phyllis in the noontide shade  Or at thy jovial festivals appear  Great Bacchus who alone the soul can clear  From all that it has felt and all that it can fear  Come on then let us feast let Chloe sing  And soft Neaera touch the trembling string  Enjoy the present hour nor seek to know  What good or ill tomorrow may bestow  But these delights soon pall upon the taste  Let's try then if more serious cannot last  Wealth let us heap on wealth or fame pursue  Let power and glory be our points in view  In courts in camps in senates let us live  Our levees crowded like the buzzing hive  Each weak attempt the same sad lesson brings  Alas what vanity in human things  What means then shall we try where hope to find  A friendly harbour for the restless mind  Who still you see impatient to obtain  Knowledge immense so Nature's laws ordain  Ev'n now though fetter'd in corporeal clay  Climbs step by step the prospect to survey  And seeks unweary'd Truth's eternal ray  No fleeting joys she asks which must depend  On the frail senses and with them must end  But such as suit her own immortal fame  Free from all change eternally the same  Take courage then these joys we shall attain  Almighty Wisdom never acts in vain  Nor shall the soul on which it has bestow'd  Such powers e'er perish like an earthly clod  But purg'd at length from soul corruption's stain  Freed from her prison and unbound her chain  She shall her native strength and native skies regain  To heav'n an old inhabitant return  And draw nectareous streams from truth's perpetual urn  Whilst life remains if life it can be call'd  T' exist in fleshly bondage thus enthrall'd  Tir'd with the dull pursuit of worldly things  The soul scarce wakes or opes her gladsome wings  Yet still the godlike exile in disgrace  Retains some marks of her celestial race  Else when from Mem'ry's store can she produce  Such various thoughts or range them so for use  Can matter these contain dispose apply  Can in her cells such mighty treasures lie  Or can her native force produce them to the eye  Whence is this power this foundress of all arts  Serving adorning life through all its parts  Which names impos'd by letters mark'd those names  Adjusted properly by legal claims  From woods and wilds collected rude mankind  And cities laws and governments design'd  What can this be but some bright ray from heaven  Some emanation from Omniscience given  When now the rapid stream of Eloquence  Bears all before it passion reason sense  Can its dread thunder or its lightning's force  Derive their essence from a mortal source  What think you of the bard's enchanting art  Which whether he attempts to warm the heart  With fabled scenes or charm the ear with rhyme  Breathes all pathetic lovely and sublime  Whilst things on earth roll round from age to age  The same dull farce repeated on the stage  The poet gives us a creation new  More pleasing and more perfect than the true  The mind who always to perfection hastes  Perfection such as here she never tastes  With gratitude accepts the kind deceit  And thence foresees a system more compleat  Of those what think you who the circling race  Of suns and their revolving planets trace  And comets journeying through unbounded space  Say can you doubt but that th' allsearching soul  That now can traverse heaven from pole to pole  From thence descending visits but this earth  And shall once more regain the regions of her birth  Could she thus act unless some Power unknown  From matter quite distinct and all her own  Supported and impell'd her She approves  Selfconscious and condemns she hates and loves  Mourns and rejoices hopes and is afraid  Without the body's unrequested aid  Her own internal strength her reason guides  By this she now compares things now divides  Truth's scatter'd fragments piece by piece collects  Rejoins and thence her edifice erects  Piles arts on arts effects to causes ties  And rears th' aspiring fabric to the skies  From whence as on a distant plain below  She sees from causes consequences flow  And the whole chain distinctly comprehends  Which from th' Almighty's throne to earth descends  And lastly turning inwardly her eyes  Perceives how all her own ideas rise  Contemplates what she is and whence she came  And almost comprehends her own amazing frame  Can mere machines be with such powers endued  Or conscious of those powers suppose they could  For body is but a machine alone  Mov'd by external force and impulse not its own  Rate not th' extension of the human mind  By the plebeian standard of mankind  But by the size of those gigantic few  Whom  Greece  and  Rome  still offer to our view  Or  Britain  welldeserving equal praise  Parent of heroes too in better days  Why should I try her num'rous sons to name  By verse law eloquence consign'd to fame  Or who have forc'd fair Science into sight  Long lost in darkness and afraid of light  O'er all superior like the solar ray  First  Bacon  usher'd in the dawning day  And drove the mists of sophistry away  Pervaded nature with amazing force  Following experience still throughout his course  And finishing at length his destin'd way  To  Newton  he bequeath'd the radiant lamp of day  Illustrious souls if any tender cares  Affect angelic breasts for man's affairs  If in your present happy heav'nly state  You're not regardless quite of  Britain's  fate  Let this degen'rate land again be blest  With that true vigour which she once possest  Compel us to unfold our slumb'ring eyes  And to our ancient dignity to rise  Such wond'rous powers as these must sure be given  For most important purposes by heaven  Who bids these stars as bright examples shine  Besprinkled thinly by the hand divine  To form to virtue each degenerate time  And point out to the soul its origin sublime  That there's a self which after death shall live  All are concern'd about and all believe  That something's ours when we from life depart  This all conceive all feel it at the heart  The wise of learn'd antiquity proclaim  This truth the public voice declares the same  No land so rude but looks beyond the tomb  For future prospects in a world to come  Hence without hopes to be in life repaid  We plant slow oaks posterity to shade  And hence vast pyramids aspiring high  Lift their proud heads aloft and time defy  Hence is our love or fame a love so strong  We think no dangers great or labours long  By which we hope our beings to extend  And to remotest times in glory to descend  For fame the wretch beneath the gallows lies  Disowning every crime for which he dies  Of life profuse tenacious of a name  Fearless of death and yet afraid of shame  Nature has wove into the human mind  This anxious care for names we leave behind  T' extend our narrow views beyond the tomb  And give an earnest of a life to come  For if when dead we are but dust or clay  Why think of what posterity shall say  Her praise or censure cannot us concern  Nor ever penetrate the silent urn  What mean the nodding plumes the fun'ral train  And marble monument that speaks in vain  With all those cares which every nation pays  To their unfeeling dead in diff'rent ways  Some in the flowerstrewn grave the corpse have lay'd  And annual obsequies around it pay'd  As if to please the poor departed shade  Others on blazing piles the body burn  And store their ashes in the faithful urn  But all in one great principle agree  To give a fancy'd immortality  Why should I mention those whose ouzy soil  Is render'd fertile by th' o'erflowing  Nile  Their dead they bury not nor burn with fires  No graves they dig erect no fun'ral pires  But washing first th' emboweld'd body clean  Gums spice and melted pitch they pour within  Then with strong fillets bind it round and round  To make each flaccid part compact and sound  And lastly paint the varnish'd surface o'er  With the same features which in life it wore  So strong their presage of a future state  And that our nobler part survives the body's fate  Nations behold remote from reason's beams  Where  Indian Ganges  rolls his sandy streams  Of life impatient rush into the fire  And willing victims to their Gods expire  Persuaded the loose soul to regions flies  Blest with eternal spring and cloudless skies  Nor is less fam'd the oriental wife  For stedfast virtue and contempt of life  These heroines mourn not with loud female cries  Their husbands lost or with o'erflowing eyes  But strange to tell their funeral piles ascend  And in the same sad flames their sorrows end  In hopes with them beneath the shades to rove  And there renew their interrupted love  In climes where  Boreas  breathes eternal cold  See numerous nations warlike fierce and bold  To battle all unanimously run  Nor fire nor sword nor instant death they shun  Whence this disdain of life in every breast  But from a notion on their minds imprest  That all who for their country die are blest  Add too to these the once prevailing dreams  Of sweet  Elysian  groves and  Stygian  streams  All shew with what consent mankind agree  In the firm hope of Immortality  Grant these th' inventions of the crafty priest  Yet such inventions never could subsist  Unless some glimmerings of a future state  Were with the mind coaeval and innate  For every fiction which can long persuade  In truth must have its first foundations laid  Because we are unable to conceive  How unembodied soul can act and live  The vulgar give them forms and limbs and faces  And habitations in peculiar places  Hence reasoners more refin'd but not more wise  Struck with the glare of such absurdities  Their whole existence fabulous suspect  And truth and falshood in a lump reject  Too indolent to learn what may be known  Or else too proud that ignorance to own  For hard's the task the daubing to pervade  Folly and fraud on Truth's fair form have laid  Yet let that task be ours for great the prize  Nor let us Truth's celestial charms despise  Because that priests or poets may disguise  That there's a God from Nature's voice is clear  And yet what errors to this truth adhere  How have the fears and follies of mankind  Now multiply'd their Gods and now subjoin'd  To each the frailties of the human mind  Nay superstition spread at length so wide  Beasts birds and onions too were deify'd  Th'  Athenian  sage revolving in his mind  This weakness blindness madness of mankind  Foretold that in maturer days though late  When time should ripen the decrees of Fate  Some God would light us like the rising day  Through error's maze and chase these clouds away  Long since has time fulfill'd this great decree  And brought us aid from this Divinity  Well worth our search discoveries may be made  By Nature void of the celestial aid  Let's try what her conjectures then can reach  Nor scorn plain Reason when she deigns to teach  That mind and body often sympathize  Is plain such is this union Nature ties  But then as often too they disagree  Which proves the soul's superior progeny  Sometimes the body in full strength we find  Whilst various ails debilitate the mind  At others whilst the mind its force retains  The body sinks with sickness and with pains  Now did one common fate their beings end  Alike they'd sicken and alike they'd mend  But sure experience on the slightest view  Shews us that the reverse of this is true  For when the body oft expiring lies  Its limbs quite senseless and half clos'd its eyes  The mind new force and eloquence acquires  And with prophetic voice the dying lips inspires  Of like materials were they both compos'd  How comes it that the mind when sleep has clos'd  Each avenue of sense expatiates wide  Her liberty restor'd her bonds unty'd  And like some bird who from its prison flies  Claps her exulting wings and mounts the skies  Grant that corporeal is the human mind  It must have parts  in infinitum  join'd  And each of these must will perceive design  And draw confus'dly in a different line  Which then can claim dominion o'er the rest  Or stamp the ruling passion in the breast  Perhaps the mind is form'd by various arts  Of modelling and figuring these parts  Just as if circles wiser were than squares  But surely common sense aloud declares  That site and figure are as foreign quite  From mental powers as colours black or white  Allow that motion is the cause of thought  With what strange powers must motion then be fraught  Reason sense science must derive their source  From the wheel's rapid whirl or pully's force  Tops whipp'd by schoolboys sages must commence  Their hoops like them be cudgel'd into sense  And boiling pots o'erflow with eloquence  Whence can this very motion take its birth  Not sure from matter from dull clods of earth  But from a living spirit lodg'd within  Which governs all the bodily machine  Just as th' Almighty Universal Soul  Informs directs and animates the whole  Cease then to wonder how th' immortal mind  Can live when from the body quite disjoin'd  But rather wonder if she e'er could die  So fram'd so fashion'd for eternity  Selfmov'd not form'd of parts together ty'd  Which time can dissipate and force divide  For beings of this make can never die  Whose powers within themselves and their own essence lie  If to conceive how any thing can be  From shape abstracted and locality  Is hard what think you of the Deity  His Being not the least relation bears  As far as to the human mind appears  To shape or size similitude or place  Cloath'd in no form and bounded by no space  Such then is God a Spirit pure refin'd  From all material dross and such the human mind  For in what part of essence can we see  More certain marks of Immortality  Ev'n from this dark confinement with delight  She looks abroad and prunes herself for flight  Like an unwilling inmate longs to roam  From this dull earth and seek her native home  Go then forgetful of its toil and strife  Pursue the joys of this fallacious life  Like some poor fly who lives but for a day  Sip the fresh dews and in the sunshine play  And into nothing then dissolve away  Are these our great pursuits is this to live  These all the hopes this muchlov'd world can give  How much more worthy envy is their fate  Who search for truth in a superior state  Not groping step by step as we pursue  And following reason's muchentangled clue  But with one great and instantaneous view  But how can sense remain perhaps you'll say  Corporeal organs if we take away  Since it from them proceeds and with them must decay  Why not or why may not the soul receive  New organs since ev'n art can these retrieve  The silver trumpet aids th' obstructed ear  And optic glasses the dim eye can clear  These in mankind new faculties create  And lift him far above his native state  Call down revolving planets from the sky  Earth's secret treasures open to his eye  The whole minute creation make his own▪  With all the wonders of a world unknown  How could the mind did she alone depend  On sense the errors of those senses mend  Yet oft' we see those senses she corrects  And oft' their information quite rejects  In distances of things their shapes and size  Our reason judges better than our eyes  Declares not this the soul's preeminence  Superior to and quite distinct from sense  For sure 'tis likely that since now so high  Clogg'd and unfledg'd she dares her wings to try  Loos'd and mature she shall her strength display  And soar at length to Truth's refulgent ray  Inquire you how these powers we shall attain  'Tis not for us to know our search is vain  Can any now remember or relate  How he existed in the embryo state  Or one from birth insensible of day  Conceive ideas of the solar ray  That light's deny'd to him which others see  He knows perhaps you'll sayand so do we  The mind contemplative finds nothing here  On earth that's worthy of a wish or fear  He whose sublime pursuit is God and truth  Burns like some absent and impatient youth  To join the object of his warm desires  Thence to sequester'd shades and streams retires  And there delights his passion to rehearse  In wisdom's sacred voice or in harmonious verse  To me most happy therefore he appears  Who having once unmov'd by hopes or fears  Survey'd this sun earth ocean clouds and flame  Well satisfy'd returns from whence he came  Is life a hundred years or e'er so few  'Tis repetition all and nothing new  A fair where thousands meet but none can stay  An inn where travellers bait then post away  A sea where man perpetually is tost  Now plung'd in bus'ness now in trifles lost  Who leave it first the peaceful port first gain  Hold then no farther launch into the main  Contract your sails life nothing can bestow  By long continuance but continued woe  The wretched privilege daily to deplore  The funerals of our friends who go before  Diseases pains anxieties and cares  And age surrounded with a thousand snares  But whither hurry'd by a generous scorn  Of this vain world ah whither am I borne  Let none unbid th' Almighty's standard quit  Howe'er severe our post we must submit  Could I a firm persuasion once attain  That after death no being would remain  To those dark shades I'd willingly descend  Where all must sleep this drama at an end  Nor life accept although renew'd by Fate  Ev'n from its earliest and its happiest state  Might I from Fortune's bounteous hand receive  Each boon each blessing in her power to give  Genius and science morals and good sense  Unenvy'd honours wit and eloquence  A numerous offspring to the world well known  Both for paternal virtues and their own  Ev'n at this mighty price I'd not be bound  To tread the same dull circle round and round  The soul requires enjoyments more sublime  By space unbounded undestroy'd by time  BOOK II  GOD then through all creation gives we find  Sufficient marks of an indulgent mind  Excepting in ourselves ourselves of all  His works the chief on this terrestrial ball  His own bright image who alone unblest  Feel ills perpetual happy all the rest  But hold presumptuous charge not heav'n's decree  With such injustice such partiality  Yet true it is survey we life around  Whole hosts of ills on every side are found  Who wound not here and there by chance a foe  But at the species meditate the blow  What millions perish by each others hands  In war's fierce rage or by the dread commands  Of tyrants languish out their lives in chains  Or lose them in variety of pains  What numbers pinch'd by want and hunger die  In spite of Nature's liberality  Those still more numerous I to name disdain  By lewdness and intemperance justly slain  What numbers guiltless of their own disease  Are snatch'd by sudden death or waste by slow degrees  Where then is Virtue's welldeserv'd reward  Let's pay to Virtue every due regard  That she enables man let us confess  To bear those evils which she can't redress  Gives hope and conscious peace and can assuage  Th' impetuous tempests both of lust and rage  Yet she's a guard so far from being sure  That oft her friends peculiar ills endure  Where Vice prevails severest is their fate  Tyrants pursue them with a threefold hate  How many struggling in their country's cause  And from their country meriting applause  Have fall'n by wretches fond to be inslav'd  And perish'd by the hands themselves had sav'd  Soon as superior worth appears in view  See knaves and fools united to pursue  The man so form'd they all conspire to blame  And Envy's pois'nous tooth attacks his fame  Should he at length so truly good and great  Prevail and rule with honest views the state  Then must he toil for an ungrateful race  Submit to clamor libels and disgrace  Threaten'd oppos'd defeated in his ends  By foes seditious and aspiring friends  Hear this and tremble all who would be great  Yet know not what attends that dang'rous wretched state  Is private life from all these evils free  Vice of all kinds rage envy there we see  Deceit that Friendship's mask insidious wears  Quarrels and feuds and law's intangling snares  But there are pleasures still in human life  Domestic ease a tender loving wife  Children whose dawning smiles your heart engage  The grace and comfort of softstealing age  If happiness exists 'tis surely here  But are these joys exempt from care and fear  Need I the miseries of that state declare  When different passions draw the wedded pair  Or say how hard those passions to discern  Ere the dye's cast and 'tis too late to learn  Who can insure that what is right and good  These children shall pursue or if they shou'd  Death comes when least you fear so black a day  And all your blooming hopes are snatch'd away  We say not that these ills from virtue flow  Did her wise precepts rule the world we know  The golden ages would again begin  But 'tis our lot in this to suffer and to sin  Observing this some sages have decreed  That all things from two causes must proceed  Two principles with equal power endued  This wholly evil that supremely good  From this arise the miseries we endure  Whilst that administers a friendly cure  Hence life is chequer'd still with bliss and woe  Hence tares with golden crops promiscuous grow  And poisonous serpents make their dread repose  Beneath the covert of the fragrant rose  Can such a system satisfy the mind  Are both these Gods in equal power conjoin'd  Or one superior Equal if you say  Chaos returns since neither will obey  Is one superior good or ill must reign  Eternal joy or everlasting pain  Whiche'er is conquer'd must entirely yield  And the victorious God enjoy the field  Hence with these fictions of the  Magi's  brain  Hence ouzy  Nile  with all her monstrous train  Or comes the Stoic nearer to the right  He holds that whatsoever yields delight  Wealth fame externals all are useless things  Himself halfstarving happier far than kings  'Tis fine indeed to be so wond'rous wise  By the same reas'ning too he pain denies  Roast him or flay him break him on the wheel  Retract he will not though he can't but feel▪  Pain's not an ill he utters with a groan  What then an inconvenience 'tis he'll own  What vigour health and beauty are these good  No they may be accepted not pursued  Absurd to squabble thus about a name  Quibbling with diff'rent words that mean the same  Stoic were you not fram'd of flesh and blood  You might be blest without external good  But know be selfsufficient as you can  You are not spirit quite but frail and mortal man  But since these sages so absurdly wise  Vainly pretend enjoyments to despise  Because externals and in Fortune's power  Now mine now thine the blessings of an hour  Why value then that strength of mind they boast  As often varying and as quickly lost  A headach hurts it or a rainy day  And a slow fever wipes it quite away  See  Lord Somers  one whose councils one  Duke of Marlborough▪  whose conqu'ring hand  Once sav'd Britannia's almost finking land  Examples of the mind's extensive power  Examples too how quickly fades that flower  Dean Swift  Him let me add whom late we saw excel  In each politer kind of writing well  Whether he strove our follies to expose  In easy verse or droll and hum'rous prose  Few years alas compel his throne to quit  This mighty monarch o'er the realms of wit  See selfsurviving he's an idiot grown  A melancholy proof our parts are not our own  Thy tenets Stoic yet we may forgive  If in a future state we cease to live  For here the virtuous suffer much 'tis plain  If pain is evil this must God arraign  And on this principle confess we must  Pain can no evil be or God must be unjust  Blind man whose reason such strait bounds confine  That ere it touches truth's extremest line  It stops amaz'd and quits the great design  Own you not Stoic God is just and true  Dare to proceed secure this path pursue  'Twill soon conduct you far beyond the tomb  To future justice and a life to come  This path you say is hid in endless night  'Tis selfconceit alone obstructs your sight  You stop ere half your destin'd course is run  And triumph when the conquest is not won  By this the Sophists were of old misled  See what a monstrous race from one mistake is bred  Hear then my argumentconfess we must  A God there is supremely wise and just  If so however things affect our sight  As sings our bard  Pope    whatever is is right  But is it right what here so oft appears  That vice should triumph virtue sink in tears  The inference then that closes this debate  Is that there must exist a future state  The wise extending their inquiries wide  See how both states are by connection ty'd  Fools view but part and not the whole survey  So crowd existence all into a day  Hence are they led to hope but hope in vain  That Justice never will resume her reign  On this vain hope adulterers thieves rely  And to this altar vile assassins fly  "But rules not God by general laws divine  "Man's vice or virtues change not the design"  What laws are these instruct us if you can  There's one design'd for brutes and one for man  Another guides inactive matter's course  Attracting and attracted by its force  Hence mutual gravity subsists between  Far distant worlds and ties the vast machine  The laws of life why need I call to mind  Obey'd by birds and beasts of every kind  By all the sandy desart's savage brood  And all the num'rous offspring of the flood  Of these none uncontroul'd and lawless rove  But to some destin'd end spontaneous move  Led by that instinct heav'n itself inspires  Or so much reason as their state requires  See all with skill acquire their daily food  All use those arms which Nature has bestow'd  Produce their tender progeny and feed  With care parental whilst that care they need  In these lov'd offices compleatly blest  No hopes beyond them nor vain fears molest  Man o'er a wider field extends his views  God through the wonders of his works pursues  Exploring thence his attributes and laws  Adores loves imitates th' Eternal Cause  For sure in nothing we approach so nigh  The great example of divinity  As in benevolence the patriot's soul  Knows not selfcenter'd for itself to roll  But warms enlightens animates the whole  Its mighty orb embraces first his friends  His country next then man nor here it ends  But to the meanest animal descends  Wise Nature has this social law confirm'd  By forming man so helpless and unarm'd  His want of others' aid and power of speech  T' implore that aid this lesson daily teach  Mankind with other animals compare  Single how weak and impotent they are  But view them in their complicated state  Their powers how wond'rous and their strength how great  When social virtue individuals joins  And in one solid mass like gravity combines  This then's the first great law by Nature giv'n  Stamp'd on our souls and ratify'd by Heav'n  All from utility this law approve  As every private bliss must spring from social love  Why deviate then so many from this law  See passions custom vice and folly draw  Survey the rolling globe from East to West  How few alas how very few are blest  Beneath the frozen poles and burning line  What poverty and indolence combine  To cloud with Error's mists the human mind  No trace of man but in the form we find  And are we free from error and distress  Whom Heav'n with clearer light has pleas'd to bless  Whom true religion leads for she but leads  By soft persuasion not by force proceeds  Behold how we avoid this radiant sun  This proffer'd guide how obstinately shun  And after Sophistry's vain systems run  For these as for essentials we engage  In wars and massacres with holy rage  Brothers by brothers' impious hands are slain  Mistaken zeal how savage is thy reign  Unpunish'd vices here so much abound  All right and wrong all order they confound  These are the giants who the gods defy  And mountains heap on mountains to the sky  Sees this th' Almighty Judge or seeing spares  And deems the crimes of man beneath his cares  He sees and will at last rewards bestow  And punishments not less assur'd for being slow  Nor doubt I though this state confus'd appears  That ev'n in this God sometimes interferes  Sometimes lest man should quite his power disown  He makes that pow'r to trembling nations known  But rarely this not for each vulgar end  As Superstition's idle tales pretend  Who thinks all foes to God who are her own  Directs his thunder and usurps his throne  Nor know I not how much a conscious mind  Avails to punish or reward mankind  Ev'n in this life thou impious wretch must feel  The Fury's scourges and th' infernal wheel  From man's tribunal though thou hop'st to run  Thyself thou canst not nor thy conscience shun  What must thou suffer when each dire disease  The progeny of vice thy fabric seize  Consumption fever and the racking pain  Of spasms and gout and stone a frightful train  When life new tortures can alone supply  Life thy sole hope thou'lt hate yet dread to die  Should such a wretch to num'rous years arrive  It can be little worth his while to live  No honours no regards his age attend  Companions fly he ne'er could have a friend  His flatterers leave him and with wild affright  He looks within and shudders at the sight  When threat'ning Death uplifts his pointed dart  With what impatience he applies to art  Life to prolong amidst disease and pains  Why this if after it no sense remains  Why should he choose these miseries to endure  If Death could grant an everlasting cure  'Tis plain there's something whispers in his ear  Though fain he'd hide it he has much to fear  See the reverse how happy those we find  Who know by merit to engage mankind  Prais'd by each tongue by every heart belov'd  For Virtues practis'd and for Arts improv'd  Their easy aspects shine with smiles serene  And all is peace and happiness within  Their sleep is ne'er disturb'd by fears or strife  Nor lust nor wine impair the springs of life  Him Fortune cannot sink nor much elate  Whose views extend beyond this mortal state  By age when summon'd to resign his breath  Calm and serene he sees approaching death  As the safe port the peaceful silent shore  Where he may rest life's tedious voyage o'er  He and he only is of death afraid  Whom his own conscience has a coward made  Whilst he who Virtue's radiant course has run  Descends like a serenelysetting sun  His thoughts triumphant Heaven alone employs  And hope anticipates his future joys  So good so blest th' illustrious  Bishop of Worcester See vol II p  Hough  we find  Whose image dwells with pleasure on my mind  The Mitre's glory Freedom's constant friend  In times which ask'd a champion to defend  Who after near a hundred virtuous years  His senses perfect free from pains and fears  Replete with life with honours and with age  Like an applauded actor left the stage  Or like some victor in th' Olympic games  Who having run his course the crown of Glory claims  From this just contrast plainly it appears  How Conscience can inspire both hopes and fears  But whence proceed these hopes or whence this dread  If nothing really can affect the dead  See all things join to promise and presage  The sure arrival of a future age  Whate'er their lot is here the good and wise  Nor doat on life nor peevishly despise  An honest man when Fortune's storms begin  Has Consolation always sure within  And if she sends a more propitious gale  He's pleas'd but not forgetful it may fail  Nor fear that he who sits so loose to life  Should too much shun its labours and its strife  And scorning wealth contented to be mean  Shrink from the duties of this bustling scene  Or when his country's safety claims his aid  Avoid the fight inglorious and afraid  Who scorns life most must surely be most brave  And he who power contemns be least a slave  Virtue will lead him to Ambition's ends  And prompt him to defend his country and his friends  But still his merit you can not regard  Who thus pursues a posthumous reward  His soul you cry is uncorrupt and great  Who quite uninfluenc'd by a future state  Embraces Virtue from a nobler sense  Of her abstracted native excellence  From the selfconscious joy her essence brings  The beauty fitness harmony of things  It may be so yet he deserves applause  Who follows where instructive Nature draws  Aims at rewards by her indulgence given  And soars triumphant on her wings to Heaven  Say what this venal virtuous man pursues  No mean rewards no mercenary views  Not wealth usurious or a num'rous train  Not fame by fraud acquir'd or title vain  He follows but where Nature points the road  Rising in Virtue's school till he ascends to God  But we th' inglorious common herd of man  Sail without compass toil without a plan  In Fortune's varying storms for ever tost  Shadows pursue that in pursuit are lost  Mere infants all 'till life's extremest day  Scrambling for toys then tossing them away  Who rests of Immortality assur'd  Is safe whatever ills are here endur'd  He hopes not vainly in a world like this  To meet with pure uninterrupted bliss  For good and ill in this imperfect state  Are ever mix'd by the decrees of Fate  With Wisdom's richest harvest Folly grows  And baleful hemlock mingles with the rose  All things are blended changeable and vain  No hope no wish we perfectly obtain  God may perhaps might human Reason's line  Pretend to fathom infinite design  Have thus ordain'd things that the restless mind  No happiness compleat on earth may find  And by this friendly chastisement made wise  To Heaven her safest best retreat may rise  Come then since now in safety we have past  Through Error's rocks and see the port at last  Let us review and recollect the whole  Thus stands my argumentThe thinking soul  Cannot terrestrial or material be  But claims by Nature Immortality  God who created it can make it end  We question not but cannot apprehend  He will because it is by him endued  With strong ideas of allperfect Good  With wond'rous powers to know and calculate  Things too remote from this our earthly state  With sure presages of a life to come  All false and useless if beyond the tomb  Our beings cease we therefore can't believe  God either acts in vain or can deceive  If every rule of equity demands  That Vice and Virtue from th' Almighty's hands  Should due rewards and punishments receive  And this by no means happens whilst we live  It follows that a time must surely come  When each shall meet their welladjusted doom  Then shall this scene which now to human sight  Seems so unworthy Wisdom infinite  A system of consummate skill appear  And every cloud dispers'd be beautiful and clear  Doubt we of this what solid proof remains  That o'er the world a wise Disposer reigns  Whilst all Creation speaks a power divine  Is it deficient in the main design  Not so the day shall come pretend not now  Presumptuous to enquire or when or how  But after death shall come th' important day  When God to all his justice shall display  Each action with impartial eyes regard  And in a just proportion punish and reward  THE ARBOUR AN ODE TO CONTENTMENT  BY MR THOMAS COLE  Of Queen's College Cambridge    TO these lone shades where Peace delights to dwell  May Fortune oft permit me to retreat  Here bid the world with all its cares farewel  And leave its pleasures to the rich and great  Oft as the summer's sun shall cheer this scene  With that mild gleam which points his parting ray  Here let my soul enjoy each eve serene  Here share its calm 'till life's declining day  No gladsome image then should 'scape my sight  From these gay flowers which border near my eye  To yon bright cloud that decks with richest light  The gilded mantle of the western sky  With ample gaze I'd trace that ridge remote  Where opening cliffs disclose the boundless main  With earnest ken from each low hamlet note  The steeple's summit peeping o'er the plain  What various works that rural landscape fill  Where mingling hedgerows beauteous fields inclose  And prudent Culture with industrious skill  Her chequer'd scene of crops and fallows shows  How should I love to mark that riv'let's maze  Through which it works its untaught course along  Whilst near its grassy banks the herd shall graze  And blithsome milkmaid chaunt her thoughtless song  Still would I note the shades of length'ning sheep  As scatter'd o'er the hill's slant brow they rove  Still note the day's last glimm'ring lustre creep  From off the verge of yonder upland grove  Nor should my leisure seldom wait to view  The slowwing'd rooks in homeward train succeed  Nor yet forbear the swallow to pursue  With quicker glance close skimming o'er the mead  But mostly here should I delight t' explore  The bounteous laws of Nature's mystic power  Then muse on Him who blesseth all her store  And give to solemn thoughts the sober hour  Let mirth unenvy'd laugh with proud disdain  And deem it spleen one moment thus to waste  If so she keep far hence her noisy train  Nor interrupt those joys she cannot taste  Far sweeter streams shall flow from Wisdom's spring  Than she receives from Folly's costliest bowl  And what delights can her chief dainties bring  Like those which feast the heavenlypensive soul  Hail Silence then be thou my frequent guest  For thou art wont my gratitude to raise  As high as wonder can the theme suggest  Whene'er I meditate my Maker's praise  What joy for tutor'd Piety to learn  All that my Christian solitude can teach  Where weakey'd Reason's self may well discern  Each clearer truth the gospel deigns to preach  No object here but may convince the mind  Of more than thoughtful honesty shall need  Nor can Suspense long question here to find  Sufficient evidence to fix its creed  'Tis God that gives this bower its aweful gloom  His arched verdure does its roof invest  He breathes the life of fragrance on its bloom  And with his kindness makes its owner blest  Oh may the guidance of thy grace attend  The use of all thy bounty shall bestow  Lest folly should mistake its sacred end  Or vice convert it into means of woe  Incline and aid me still my life to steer  As conscience dictates what to shun or chuse  Nor let my heart feel anxious hope or fear  For aught this world can give me or refuse  Then shall not wealth's parade one wish excite  For wretched state to barter peace away  Nor vain ambition's lure my pride invite  Beyond Contentment's humble path to stray  What though thy wisdom may my lot deny  The treasur'd plenty freely to dispense  Yet well thy goodness can that want supply  With larger portions of benevolence  And sure the heart that wills the gen'rous deed  May all the joys of Charity command  For she best loves from notice to recede  And deals her unsought gifts with secret hand  Then will I sometimes bid my fancy steal  That unclaim'd wealth no property restrains  Soothe with fictitious aid my friendly zeal  And realize each godly act she feigns  So shall I gain the gold without alloy  Without oppression toil or treach'rous snares  So shall I know its use its power employ  And yet avoid its dangers and its cares  And spite of all that boastful wealth can do  In vain would Fortune strive the rich to bless  Were they not flatter'd with some distant view  Of what she ne'er can give them to possess  E'en Wisdom's high conceit great wants would feel  If not supply'd from Fancy's boundless store  And nought but shame makes power itself conceal  That she to satisfy must promise more  But though experience will not fail to show  Howe'er its truth man's weakness may upbraid  That what he mostly values here below  Owes half its relish to kind Fancy's aid  Yet should not Prudence her light wing command  She may too far extend her heedless flight  For Pleasure soon shall quit her fairyland  If Nature's regions are not held in sight  From Truth's abode in search of kind deceit  Within due limits she may safely roam  If roving does not make her hate retreat  And with aversion shun her proper home  But thanks to those whose fond parental care  To Learning's paths my youthful steps confin'd  I need not shun a state which lets me share  Each calm delight that soothes the studious mind  While genius lasts  his  fame shall ne'er decay  Whose artful hand first caus'd its fruits to spread  In lasting volumes stampt the printed lay  And taught the Muses to embalm the dead  To him I owe each fair instructive page  Where Science tells me what her sons have known  Collects their choicest works from every age  And makes me wise with knowledge not my own  Books rightly us'd may every state secure  From fortune's evils may our peace defend  May teach us how to shun or to endure  The foe malignant and the faithless friend  Should rigid Want withdraw all outward aid  Kind stores of inward comfort they can bring  Should keen Disease life's tainted stream invade  Sweet to the soul from them pure health may spring  Should both at once man's weakly frame infest  Some letter'd charm may still relief supply  'Gainst all events prepare his patient breast  And make him quite resign'd to live or die  For though no words can time or fate restrain  No sounds suppress the call of Nature's voice  Though neither rhymes nor spells can conquer pain  Nor magic's self make wretchedness our choice  Yet reason while it forms the subtile plan  Some purer source of pleasure to explore  Must deem it vain for that poor pilgrim man  To think of resting till his journey's o'er  Must deem each fruitless toil by heaven design'd  To teach him where to look for real bliss  Else why should heaven excite the hope to find  What balk'd pursuit must here for ever miss  THE GROTTO AN ODE TO SILENCE  BY THE SAME  COME musing Silence nor refuse to shed  Thy sober influence o'er this darkling cell  The desart waste and lonely plain  Could ne'er confine thy peaceful reign  Nor dost thou only love to dwell  'Mid the dark mansions of the vaulted dead  For still at eve's serenest hour  All Nature owns thy soothing power  Oft hast thou deign'd with me to rove  Beneath the calm sequester'd grove  Oft deign'd my secret steps to lead  Along the dewy pathless mead  Or up the dusky lawn to spy  The last faint gleamings of the twilight sky  Then wilt thou still thy pensive vot'ry meet  Oft as he calls thee to this gloomy seat  For here with solemn mystic rite  Wert thou invok'd to consecrate the ground  Ere these rude walls were rear'd remote from sight  Or ere with moss this shaggy roof was crown'd  Hail blessed parent of each purer thought  That doth at once the heart exalt and mend  Here wilt thou never fail to find  My vacant solitude inclin'd  Thy serious lessons to attend  For they I ween shall be with goodness fraught  Whether thou bid me meditate  On man in untaught Nature's state  How far this life he ought to prize  How far its transient scenes despise  What heights his reason may attain  And where its proud attempts are vain  What toils his virtue ought to brave  For Hope's rewarding joys beyond the grave  Or if in man redeem'd you bid me trace  Each wond'rous proof of heaven's transcendent grace  Then breathe some sparks of that celestial fire  Which in the raptur'd seraph glows above  Where fainted myriads crowd the joyful choir  And harp their praises round the throne of love  The trifling sons of Levity and Pride  Hence shall thy aweful seriousness exclude  Nor shall loud Riot's thoughtless train  With frantic mirth this grott profane  No foe to peace shall here intrude  For thou wilt kindly bid each sound subside  Save such as soothe the list'ning sense  And serves to aid thy influence  Save where softbreathing o'er the plain  Mild Zephyr waves the rustling grain  Or where some stream from rocky source  Slow trickles down its ceaseless course  Or where the sea's imperfect roar  Comes gently murm'ring from the distant shore  But most in Philomel sweet bird of night  In plaintive Philomel is thy delight  For she or studious to prolong her grief  Or oft to vary her exaustless lay  With frequent pause from thee shall seek relief  Nor close her strain till dawns the noisy day  Without thy aid to happier tasteful art  No deep instructive science could prevail  For only where thou dost preside  Can wit's inventive powers be tried  And reason's better task would fail  Did not thy haunts the serious theme impart  The critic that with plodding head  Toils o'er the learning of the dead  The cloister'd hermit that explores  By midnight lamp religion's stores  Each sage that marks with thoughtful gaze  The lunar orb or planet's maze  And every bard that strays along  The sylvan shade intent on sacred song  Shall all to thee those various praises give  Which through thy friendly aid themselves receive  For though thou mayst from glory's seats retire  Where loud applause proclaim the honour'd name  Yet doth thy modest wisdom still inspire  Each nobler work that swells the voice of Fame  THE PICTURE OF HUMAN LIFE TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK OF CEBES THE THEBAN BY MR T SCOTT  A dissenting minister at Ipswich He was author of a paraphrase on the Book of Job and other performances and died at Hapton in the county of Norfolk November    Et vitae monstrata via est  HOR  WHILE  Saturn's  This temple was probably in the city of Thebes for Cebes was a Theban  fane with solemn step we trod  And view'd the  Devoat offerings for the most part in discharge of vows  votive honours of the God  A pictur'd tablet o'er the portal rais'd  Attach'd our eye in wonder lost we gaz'd  The pencil there some strange device had wrought  And fables all its own disguis'd the thought  Nor camp it seem'd nor city the design  Whose moral mock'd our labour to divine  Was a wall'd court where rose another bound  And higher still a third still less'ning ground  The nether area open'd at a gate  Where a vast crowd impatient seem'd to wait  Within a group of female figures stood  In motley dress a sparkling multitude  Without in station at the porch was seen  A venerable form in act and mien  Like some great teacher who with urgent tongue  Authoritative warn'd the rushing throng  From doubt to doubt we wander'd when appear'd  A fire who thus the hard solution clear'd  Strangers that allegorie scene I guess  Conquers your skill your homeborn wits no less  A foreigner long since whose nobler mind  Learning's best culture to strong genius join'd  Here liv'd convers'd and shew'd th' admiring age  Another  Samian  or  Elean  sage  He rear'd this dome to  Saturn's  aweful name  And gave that portrait to eternal fame  He reason'd much high argument he chose  High as his theme his great conceptions rose  Such wisdom flowing from a mouth but young  I heard astonish'd and enjoy'd it long  Him oft I heard this moral piece expound  With nervous eloquence and sense profound  Father if leisure with thy will conspire  Yield yield that comment to our warm desire  Free to bestow I warn you first beware  Danger impends which summons all your care  Wise virtuous blest whose heart our precepts gain  The Caselian and Salmasian editions read  wicked instead of  bitter  Abandon'd blind and wretched who disdain  For know our purpos'd theme resembles best  The fam'd  Enigma  of the

Folly's law we die  Not instant victims of her cruelty  From day to day our reasoning part she wounds  Devours its strength its noblest powers confounds▪  Awakes the lash of  Vide ver  Punishment  and tears  The mind with pangs which guilty life prepares  With opposite effect where thoughtful skill  Discerns the boundaries of Good and Ill  Folly must perish and th' illumin'd breast  To Virtue sav'd is like th' immortals blest  Give audience then with no unheeding ear  O haste no heedless auditors stand here  With strong desire in dread suspence we wait  So great the blessing and the bane so

here begins our race  Happy thrice happy who intrust their youth  To  right Opinions  and ascend to  Truth  Whom  Wisdom  tutors whom the  Virtues  hail  And with their own substantial feast regale  The rest are harlots by their flatt'ries won  In chase of empty sciences we run  Or Fortune's vanities pursue and stray  With  sensual Pleasure  in more dangerous way  See the mad round their giddy

 Wild seems her aspect and bereav'd of sight  Fortune  blind frantic deaf With restless wings  The world she ranges and her favours flings  Flings and resumes and plunders and bestows  Caprice divides the blessings and the woes  Her grace unstable as her tott'ring ball  Whene'er she smiles she meditates our fall  When most we trust her we are cheated most  In disolating loss we mourn our boast  Her cruel blast invades our hasty fruit  And withers all our glory at the root  What mean those multitudes around her Why  Such motley attitudes perplex our eye  Some in the act of wildest raptures leap  In agony some wring their hands and weep  Th' unreas'ning crowd to passion's sequel blind  By passion fir'd and impotent of mind  Competitors in clamorous suit to share  The toys she tosses with

Beneath a purer heav'n o'erflow'd with light  Full in the center of the plain behold  A court farflaming with its wall of gold  And gate of diamond where the righteous rest  This clime their home the country of the blest  Here all the  Virtues  dwell communion sweet  With  Happiness  who rules the peaceful seat  In station at th' effulgent portal see  A beauteous form of mildest majesty  Her eyes how piercing how sedate her mien  Mature in life her countenance serene  Spirit and solid thought each feature shows  And her plain robe with state unstudy'd flows  She stands upon a cube of marble fix'd  As the firm rock two lovely nymphs betwixt  Her daughters copies of her looks and air  Her candid  Truth  and sweet  Persuasion  there  She she is  Wisdom  In her stedfast eye  Behold th' expressive type of certainty  Certain her way and permanent the deed  Of gift substantial to her friends decreed  She gives magnanimous contempt of fear  She gives the confidence erect and clear  And bids th' invulnerable mind to know  Her safety from the future shafts of woe  O treasure richer than the sea or land  But why without the walls her destin'd stand  There standing she presents her potent bowl  Divine cathartic which restores the soul  This asks a comment  In some dire disease  Macbaon  's skill first purges off the lees  Then clear and strong the purple current flows  And life renew'd in every member glows  But if the patient all controul despise  Just victim of his stubborn will he dies  So  Wisdom  by her rules with healing art  Expels  Delusion's  mischiefs from the heart  Blindness and error and highboasting pride  Intemp'rance lust fierce wrath's impetuous tide  Hydropic avarice all the plagues behind  Which in the first mad court oppress'd the mind  Thus purg'd her pupil through the gate she brings  The  Virtues  hail their guest the guest enraptur'd sings  Behold the spotless band celestial charms  Scene that with awe chastises whom it warms  No harlotry no paint no gay excess  But beauty unaffected as their dress  See  Knowledge  grasping a refulgent star  See  Fortitude  in panoply of war  Justice  her equal scale aloft displays  And rights both human and divine she weighs  There  Moderation  all the pleasures bound  In brazen chains her dreaded feet surround  There bounteous  Liberality  expands  To want to worth her everloaded hands  The florid hue of  Temperance  her side  Adorn'd by  Health  a nymph in blooming pride  Lo softey'd  Meekness  holds a curbing rein  Anger's highmettled spirit to restrain  While  Moral Order  tunes her golden lyre  And whiterob'd  Probity  compleats the choir  O fairest of all fair O blissful state  What hopes sublime our ravish'd soul dilate  Substantial hopes if by the doctrine taught  The fashion'd manners are to habit wrought  Yes 'tis resolv'd Well every nerve employ  Live then restor'd and reap the promis'd joy  But whither do the Virtues lead their trust  To  Happiness  rewarder of the just  Look upward to the hill beyond the grove  A sovereign pile extends its front above  Stately and strong the lofty castle stands  Its boundless prospect all the courts commands  Within the porch high on the jasper throne  Th' Imperial Mother by her form is known  Bright as the morn when smiling on the hills  Earth air and sea with vernal joy she fills  Rich without lavish cost her vest behold  In colours of the sky and fring'd with gold  A tiar wreath'd with every flow'r that blows  Of liveliest tints around her temples glows  Eternal bloom her snowy temples binds  Fearless of burning suns and blasting winds  Now with a crown of wond'rous power her hand  Assistant round her all the virtues stand  Adorns her hero honourable meed  Of conquests won by many a valiant deed  What conquests  Formidable beasts subdu'd  Lab'ring he fought he routed he pursu'd  Once a weak prey beneath their force he cowr'd  O'erthrown and worry'd and wellnigh devour'd  Till rouz'd with his inglorious sloth possest  With generous ardour kindling in his breast  Lord of himself the victor now constrains  Those hostile monsters in his powerful chains  Explain those savage beasts at war with man  Error and Ignorance which head the van  Heartgnawing Grief and loudlamenting Woe  Incontinence a wilddestroying foe  Rapacious Avarice cruel numbers more  O'er all he triumphs now their slave before  O great atchievements more illustrious far  These triumphs than the bloody wreaths of war  But say what salutary power is shed  By the fair crown which decks the hero's head  Most beatific For possessing this  He lives rich owner of man's proper bliss  Bliss independent or on wealth or power  Fame birth or beauty or voluptuous hour  His hopes divorc'd from all exterior things  Within himself the fount of pleasure springs  Springs ever in the self approving breast  And his own honest heart's a constant feast  Where next his steps  He measures back his way  Conducted by the  Virtues  to survey  His first abode The giddy crowd below  Wasting their wretched span in crime they show  How in the whirl of passions they are tost  And shipwreck'd on the lurking shelves are lost  Here fierce  Ambition  haling in her chain  The mighty there a despicable train  Impure in  Lusts  inglorious fetter bound  And slaves of  Avarice  rooting up the ground  Thralls of  Vainglory  thralls of swelling  Pride  Unnumber'd fools unnumber'd plagues beside  Allpowerless they to burst the galling band  To spring aloft and reach yon happy land  Entangled impotent the way to find  The clear instruction blotted from their mind  Which the  Good Genius  gave Guilt's gloomy fears  Becloud their suns and sadden all their years  I stand convinc'd but yet perplex'd in thought  Why to review a wellknown scene he's brought  Scene rudely known Uncertain and confus'd  His judgement by illusions was abus'd  His evil was not evil nor his good  Aught else but vanity misunderstood  Confounding good and evil like the throng  His life like theirs was action always wrong  Enlighten'd now in the true bliss of man  He shapes his alter'd course by  Wisdom's  plan  And blest himself beholds with weeping eyes  The madding world an hospital of sighs  This retrospection ended where succeeds  His course  Where'er his wise volition leads  Where'er it leads safety attends him still  Not safer should he on  Apollo's  hill  Among the Nymphs among the vocal Powers  Dwell in the Sanctum of  Corycian  bowers  Honour'd by all the friend of humankind  Belov'd physician of the sinsick mind  Not  Esculapius  more whose power to save  Redeems his patient from the yawning grave  But never more shall his old restless foes  Awake his fears nor trouble his repose  Never In righteous habitude inur'd  From Passion's baneful anarchy secur'd  In each enticing scene each instant hard  That sovereign antidote his mind will guard  Like him who of some virtuous drug possest  Grasps the fell viper coil'd within her nest  Hears her dire hissings sees her terrors rise  And unappall'd destruction's tooth defies  Yon troops in motion from the mount explain  Various to view for there a goodly train  With garlands crown'd advance with comely pace  Noble their port and in each tranquil face  Joy Sparkles others a bareheaded throng  Batter'd and gash'd drag their slow steps along  Captives of some strange female crew  The crown'd  Long seeking safe arriv'd at  Wisdom's  bound  Exult in her imparted grace The rest  Apostates    Those on whom  Wisdom  unprevailing prest  Her healing aid rejected from her care  In evil plight their wicked days they wear  Those too who Difficulty's hill had gain'd  There basely stopp'd by dastard sloth detain'd  Apostate now in thorny wilds they rove  Pursuing furies scourge the caitiff drove  Sorrows  which gnaw  remorseful Thoughts  which tear  Blindness of mind  and  heartoppressing Fear  With all the contumelious rout of  Shame  And every ill and every hateful name  Relaps'd to  Lewdness  and her  sensual Queen  Unblushing at themselves but drunk with spleen  Wisdom's  high worth their canker'd tongues dispraise  Revile her children and blaspheme her ways  Deluded wretches thus their madness cries  Dull mopes weak dupes of philosophic lyes  Uncomforted unjoyous and unblest  Lost from the pleasures here at large possest  What pleasures boast they  Pleasures of the stews  Pleasures which  Riot's  frantic bowls infuse  These high fruition their gross souls repute  And man's chief good to sink into a brute  But who that lovely bevy blithe and gay  So smoothly gliding down the hilly way  The distinction between Opinion and Knowledge  Those are th'  Opinions  who have guided right  The unexperienc'd to the plain of light  Returning new adventurers to bring  The blessings of the lastarriv'd they sing  Why ingress yielded to their favour'd ward  Among the Virtues to themselves debarr'd  Opinion's  foot is never never found  Where  Knowledge  dwells 'tis interdicted ground  At  Wisdom's  gate th'  Opinions  must resign  Their charge those limits their employ confine  Thus trading barks skill'd in the watery road  To distant climes convey their precious load  Then turn their prow light bounding o'er the main  And with new traffic store their keels again  Thus far is clear But yet untold remains  What the Good Genius to the crowd ordains  Just on the verge of life  The instructions of the Genius  He bids them hold  A spirit with erected courage bold  Never he calls on  Fortune's  faith rely  Nor grasp her dubious gifts as property  Let not her smile transport her frown dismay  Nor praise nor blame nor wonder at her sway  Which reason never guides 'tis fortune still  Capricious chance and arbitrary will  Bad bankers vain of treasure not their own  With foolish rapture hug the trusted loan  Impatient when the powerful bond demands  Its unremember'd cov'nant from their hands  Unlike to such without a sigh restore  What  Fortune  lends anon she'll lavish more  Repenting of her bounty snatch away  Yea seize your patrimonial fund for prey  Embrace her proffer'd boon but instant rise  Spring upward and secure a lasting prize  The gift which  Wisdom  to her sons divides  Knowledge whose beam the doubting judgement guides  Scatters the sensual fog and clear to view  Distinguishes false interest from the true  Flee flee to this with unabating pace  Nor parly for a moment at the place  Where  Pleasure  and her  Harlots  tempt nor rest  But at  False Wisdom's  inn a transient guest  For short refection at her table sit  And taste what science may your palate hit  Then wing your journey forward till you reach  True  Wisdom  and imbibe the truths she'll teach  Such is th' advice the friendly  Genius  gives  He perishes who scorns who follows lives  And thus this moral piece instructs if aught  Is mystic still reveal your doubting thought  Thanks generous Sire tell then the transient bait  The Genius grants us at False Wisdom's gate  Natural knowledge how far useful and when unprofitable and hurtful  Whate'er in arts or sciences is found  Of solid use in their capacious round  These  Plato  reasons like a curbing rein  Unruly youth from devious starts restrain  Must we solicitous our souls to save  Assistance from these previous studies crave  Necessity there's none We'll not deny  Their merit in some less utility  But they contribute we aver no part  To heal the manners and amend the heart  An author's meaning in a tongue unknown  May glimmer through translation in our own  Yet masters of his language we might gain  Some trivial purposes by tedious pain  So in the sciences though rudely taught  We may attain the little that we ought  Yet accurately known they might convey  More light not wholly useless in its way  But virtue may be reach'd through all her rules  Without the curious subtleties of schools  How not the learn'd excel the common shoal  In powerful aids to meliorate the soul  Blind as the crowd alas to good and ill  Intangled by the like corrupted will  What boasts the man of letters o'er the rest  Skill'd in all tongues of all the arts possest  What hinders but he sink into a sot  A libertine or villain in a plot  Miser or knave or whatsoe'er you'll name  Of moral lunacy and reason's shame  Scandals too rife  How then for living right  Avail those studies and their vaunted light  Beyond the vulgar  Nothing But disclose  The cause from whence this strange appearance grows  Held by a potent charm in this retreat  They dwell content with nearness to the seat  Of  Virtuous Wisdom  Near methinks in vain  Since numbers oft from out the nether plain  'Scap'd from the snares of Lewdness and Excess  Undevious to her lofty station press  Yet pass these letter'd clans  What then are these  In moral things advantag'd o'er the lees  Of human race in moral things we find  These duller or less tractable of mind  Decypher that  Pride pride averts their eyes  From offer'd light in selfsufficience wise  Although unknowing they presume to know  Clogg'd with that vain conceit they creep below  Nor can mount up to yon exalted bound  True  Wisdom's  mansion by the humble found  Not found by these till the vain visions spread  By  False Opinion  in the learned head  Repentance  scatter and deceiv'd no more  They own th' illusion which deceiv'd before  That for  True Wisdom  they embrac'd her shade  And hence the healing of their souls delay'd  Strangers these lessons oft revolving hold  Fast to your hearts and into habit mould  To this high scope life's whole attention bend  Despise aught else as erring from your end  Do thus or unavailing is my care  And all th' instruction dies away in air  The DROPSICAL MAN  By Mr TAYLOR  A JOLLY brave toper who could not forbear  Though his life was in danger old port and stale beer  Gave the doctors the hearingbut still would drink on  'Till the dropsy had swell'd him as big as a ton  The more he took physic the worse still he grew  And tapping was now the last thing he could do  Affairs at this crisis and doctors come down  He began to considerso sent for his son  Tom see by what courses I've shorten'd my life  I'm leaving the world ere I'm forty and five  More than probable 'tis that in twentyfour hours  This manor this house and estate will be yours  My early excesses may teach you this truth  That 'tis working for death to drink hard in one's youth  Says Tom who's a lad of a generous spirit  And not like young rakes who're in haste to inherit  Sir don't be dishearten'd although it be true  Th' operation is painful and hazardous too  'Tis no more than what many a man has gone thro'  And then as for years you may yet be call'd young  Your life after this may be happy and long  Don't flatter me Tom was the father's reply  With a jest in his mouth and a tear in his eye  Too well by experience my vessels thou know'st  No sooner are tapp'd but they give up the ghost  PARADISE REGAIN'D  By HT  I  SEEK not for Paradise with curious eye  In Asiatic climes where Tigris' wave  Mix'd with Euphrates in tumultuous joy  Doth the broad plains of Babylonia lave  II  'Tis gone with all its charms and like a dream  Like Babylon itself is swept away  Bestow one tear upon the mournful theme  But let it not the gentle heart dismay  III  For know whereever love and virtue guide  They lead us to a state of heavenly bliss  Where joys unknown to guilt and shame preside  And pleasures unalloy'd each hour increase  IV  Behold that grove whose waving boughs admit  Through the live colonade the fruitful hill  A moving prospect with fat herds replete  Whose lowing voices all the valleys fill  V  There through the spiry grass where glides the brook  By yon tall poplar which erects its head  Above the verdure of the neighbouring oak  And gently murmurs o'er th' adjoining mead  VI  Philander and Cleora happy pair  Taste the cool breezes of the gentle wind  Their breasts from guilt their looks are free from care  Sure index of a calm contented mind  VII  'Tis here in virtuous lore the studious fair  Informs her babes nor scorns herself t' improve  While in his smile she lives whose pleasing care  Dispenses knowledge from the lips of love  VIII  No wild desires can spread their poison here  No discontent their peaceful hours attend  False joys nor flatt'ring hopes nor servile fear  Their gentle minds with jarring passions rend  IX  Here oft in pleasing solitude they rove  Recounting o'er the deeds of former days  With inward joy their wellspent time approve  And feel a recompence beyond all praise  X  Or in sweet converse through the grove or near  The fountain's birnk or where the arbour's shade  Beats back the heat fair Virtue's voice they hear  More musical by sweet digressions made  XI  With calm dependence every good they taste  Yet feel their neighbours' wants with kind regret  Nor cheer themselves alone a mean repast  But deal forth blessings round their happy seat  XII  'Tis to such virtue that the Power Supreme  The choicest of his blessings hath design'd  And shed them plenteous over every clime  The calm delights of an untainted mind  XIII  Ere yet the sad effects of foolish pride  And mean ambition still employ'd in strife  And luxury did o'er the world preside  Deprav'd the taste and pall'd the joys of life  XIV  For such the Spring in richest mantle clad  Pours forth her beauties through the gay parterre  And Autumn's various bosom is o'erspread  With all the blushing fruits that crown the year  XV  Or Summer tempts in golden beams array'd  Which o'er the fields in borrow'd lustre glow  To meditate beneath the cooling shade  Their happy state and whence their blessings flow  XVI  E'en rugged Winter varies but their joy  Painting the cheek with fresh vermilionhue  And those rough frosts which softer frames annoy  With vig'rous health their slack'ning nerves renew  XVII  From the dark bosom of the dappled Morn  To Phoebus shining with meridian light  Or when mild Evening does the sky adorn  Or the pale moon rides through the spangled night  XVIII  The varying scenes in every virtuous soul  Each pleasing change with various pleasures bless  Raise cheerful hopes and anxious fears controul  And form a Paradise of inward peace  To the Right Hon Sir ROBERT WALPOLE  Quod censet amiculus ut si  Coecus iter monstrare velit  HOR  By the Hon Mr DODINGTON afterwards Lord MELCOMBE  THO' strength of genius by experience taught  Gives thee to sound the depth of human thought  To trace the various workings of the mind  And rule the secret springs that rule mankind  Rare gift yet Walpole wilt thou condescend  To listen if thy unexperienc'd friend  Can aught of use impart though void of skill  And raise attention by sincere good will  For friendship sometimes want of parts supplies  The heart may furnish what the head denies  As when the rapid Rhine o'er swelling tides  To grace old Ocean's coast in triumph rides  Though rich in source he drains a thousand springs  Nor scorns the tribute each small riv'let brings  So thou shalt hence absorb each feeble ray  Each dawn of meaning in thy brighter day  Shalt like or where thou canst not like excuse  Since no mean interest shall prophane the Muse  No malice wrapt in truth's disguise offend  No flattery taint the freedom of a friend  When first a generous mind surveys the great  And views the crowds that on their fortune wait  Pleas'd with the shew though little understood  He only seeks the power to do the good  Thinks till he tries 'tis godlike to dispose  And gratitude still springs when bounty flows  That every grant sincere affection wins  And where our wants have end our love begins  But they who long the paths of state have trod  Learn from the clamours of the murm'ring crowd  Which cramm'd yet craving still their gates besiege  'Tis easier far to give than to oblige  This of thy conduct seems the nicest part  The chief perfection of the statesman's art  To give to fair assent a fairer face  Or foften a refusal into grace  But few there are that can be freely kind  Or know to fix the favours on the mind  Hence some whene'er they would oblige offend  And while they make the fortune lose the friend  Still give unthank'd still squander not bestow  For great men want not what to give but how  The race of men that follow courts 'tis true  Think all they get and more than all their due  Still ask but ne'er consult their own deserts  And measure by their interest not their parts  From this mistake so many men we see  But ill become the thing they wish to be  Hence discontent and fresh demands arise  More power more favour in the great man's eyes  All feel a want though none the cause suspects  But hate their patron for their own defects  Such none can please but who reforms their hearts  And when he gives them places gives them parts  As these o'erprize their worth so sure the great  May sell their favours at too dear a rate  When merit pines while clamour is preferr'd  And long attachment waits among the herd  When no distinction where distinction's due  Marks from the many the superior few  When strong cabal constrains them to be just  And makes them give at last because they must  What hopes that men of real worth should prize  What neither friendship gives nor merit buys  The man who justly o'er the whole presides  His wellweigh'd choice with wise affection guides  Knows when to stop with grace and when advance  Nor gives from importunity or chance  But thinks how little gratitude is ow'd  When favours are extorted not bestow'd  When safe on shore ourselves we see the crowd  Surround the great importunate and loud  Through such a tumult 'tis no easy task  To drive the man of real worth to ask  Surrounded thus and giddy with the shew  'Tis hard for great men rightly to bestow  From hence so few are skill'd in either case  To ask with dignity or give with grace  Sometimes the great seduc'd by love of parts  Consult our genius but neglect our hearts  Pleas'd with the glittering sparks that genius flings  They lift us tow'ring on the eagle's wings  Mark out the flights by which themselves begun  And teach our dazzled eyes to bear the sun  Till we forget the hand that made us great  And grow to envy not to emulate  To emulate a generous warmth implies  To reach the virtues that make great men rise  But envy wears a mean malignant face  And aims not at their virtues but their place  Such to oblige how vain is the pretence  When every favour is a fresh offence  By which superior power is still imply'd  And while it helps the fortune hurts the pride  Slight is the hate neglect or hardships breed  But those who hate from envy hate indeed  Since so perplex'd the choice whom shall we trust  Methinks I hear thee cry the brave the just  The man by no mean fears or hopes controul'd  Who serves thee from affection not for gold  We love the honest and esteem the brave  Despise the coxcomb but detest the knave  No shew of parts the truly wise seduce  To think that knaves can be of real use  The man who contradicts the public voice  And strives to dignify a worthless choice  Attempts a task that on the choice reflects  And lends us light to point out new defects  One worthless man that gains what he pretends  Disgusts a thousand unpretending friends  And since no art can make a counter pass  Or add the weight of gold to mimic brass  When princes to bad ore their image join  They more debase the stamp than raise the coin  Be thine that care true merit to reward  And gain that good nor will the task be hard  Souls found alike so quick by nature blend  An honest man is more than half thy friend  Him no mere views no haste to rise shall sway  Thy choice to sully or thy trust betray  Ambition here shall at due distance stand  Nor is wit dangerous in an honest hand  Besides if failings at the bottom lie  He views those failings with a lover's eye  Though small his genius let him do his best  Our wishes and belief supply the rest  Let others barter servile faith for gold  His friendship is not to be bought or sold  Fierce opposition he unmov'd shall face  Modest in favour daring in disgrace  To share thy adverse fate alone pretend  In power a servant out of power a friend  Here pour thy favours in an ample flood  Indulge thy boundless thirst of doing good  Nor think that good alone to him confin'd  Such to oblige is to oblige mankind  If thus thy mighty master's steps thou trace  The brave to cherish and the good to grace  Long shalt thou stand from rage and faction free  And teach us long to love the king and thee  Or fall a victim dangerous to the foe  And make him tremble when he strikes the blow  While honour gratitude affection join  To deck thy close and brighten thy decline  Illustrious doom the great when thus displac'd  With friendship guarded and with virtue grac'd  In aweful ruin like Rome's senate fall  The prey and worship of the wond'ring Gaul  No doubt to genius some reward is due  Excluding that were satirizing you  But yet believe thy undesigning friend  When truth and genius for thy choice contend  Though both have weight when in the balance cast  Let probity be first and parts the last  On these foundations if thou dar'st be great  And check the growth of folly and deceit  When party rage shall drop through length of days  And calumny be ripen'd into praise  Then future times shall to thy worth allow  That fame which envy would call flattery now  Thus far my zeal though for the task unfit  Has pointed out the rocks where others split  By that inspir'd though stranger to the Nine  And negligent of any fame but thine  I take that friendly but superfluous part  That acts from nature what I teach from art  To a LADY on a LANDSCAPE of her Drawing  By Mr PARROT  BEHOLD the magic of Theresa's hand  A new creation blooms at her command  Touch'd into life the vivid colours glow  Catch the warm stream and quicken as they flow  The ravish'd sight the pleasing landscape fills  Here sink the valleys and there rise the hills  Not with more horror nods bleak Calpe's  Gibraltar  height  Than here the pictur'd rock astounds the sight  Not Thames more deviouswinding leaves his source  Than here the wand'ring rivers shape their course  Obliquely lab'ring runs the gurgling rill  Still murm'ring runs or seems to murmur still  An aged oak with hoary moss o'erspread  Here lifts aloft its venerable head  There overshadowing hangs a sacred wood  And nods inverted in the neighb'ring flood  Each tree as in its native forest shoots  And blushing bends with Autumn's golden fruits  Thy pencil lends the rose a lovelier hue  And gives the lily fairer to our view  Here fruits and flow'rs adorn the varied year  And paradise with all its sweets is here  There stooping to its fall a tow'r appears  With tempests shaken and a weight of years  The daified meadow and the woodland green  In order rise and fill the various scene  Some parts in light magnificently dress'd  Obtrusive enter and stand all confess'd  Whilst others decently in shades are thrown  And by concealing make their beauties known  Alternate thus and mutual is their aid  The lights owe half their lustre to the shade  So the bright fires that light the milky way  Lost and extinguish'd in the solar ray  In the sun's absence pour a flood of light  And borrow all their brightness from the night  To cheat our eyes how well dost thou contrive  Each object here seems real and alive  Not more resembling life the figures stand  Form'd by Lysippus or by Phidias' hand  Unnumber'd beauties in the piece unite  Rush on the eye and crowd upon the sight  At once our wonder and delight you raise  We view with pleasure and with rapture praise  ODE to CUPID on VALENTINE'S Day  BY THE SAME  COME thou rosydimpled boy  Source of every heartfelt joy  Leave the blissful bow'rs awhile  Paphos

Haste to Sylvia haste away  This is thine and Hymen's day  Bid her thy soft bondage wear  Bid her for Love's rites prepare  Let the nymphs with many a flower  Deck the sacred nuptial bower  Thither

Only while we love we live  To the Worthy Humane Generous Reverend and Noble Mr FREDERICK CORNWALLIS now Archbishop of CANTERBURY  By Dr SNEYD DAVIES Written in the Year  IN frolic's hour ere serious thought had birth  There was a time my dear Cornwallis when  Fancy would take me on her airy wing  And waft to views romantic there display  Some motley vision shade and sun the cliff  O'erhanging sparkling brooks and ruins grey  Bade me meanders trace and catch the form  Of varying clouds and rainbows learn to paint  Sometimes ambition brushing by would twitch  My spirits and with winning look sublime  Allure to follow What though steep the track  Her mountain's top would overpay when climb'd  The scaler's toil her temple there was fine  And lovely thence the prospects She could tell  Where laurels grew whence many a wreath antique  But more advis'd to shun the barren twig  What is immortal verdure without fruit  And woo some thriving art her num'rous mines  Were open to the searcher's skill and pains  Caught by th' harangue heart beat and flutt'ring pulse  Sounded irregular marches to be gone  What pause a moment when Ambition calls  No the blood gallops to the distant goal  And throbs to reach it Let the lame sit still  When Fortune gentle at the hill's verge extreme  Array'd in decent robe and plain attire  Smiling approach'd and what occasion ask'd  Of climbing She already provident  Had cater'd well if stomach could digest  Her viands and a palate not too nice  Unfit she said for perilous attempt  That manly limb requir'd and sinews tough  She took and lay'd me in a vale remote  Amid the gloomy scene of fir and yew  On apple ground where Morpheus strew'd the bed  Obscurity her curtain round me drew  And syren Sloth a dull quietus sung  Sithence no fairy sights no quick'ning ray  No stir of pulse nor objects to entice  Abroad the spirits but the cloyster'd heart  Sits squat at home like pagod in a nitch  Demure or grandees with nodwatching eye  And folded arms in presence of the throne  Turk or IndostanCities forums courts  And prating sanhedrims and drumming wars  Affect no more than stories told to bed  Lethargic which at intervals the sick  Hears and forgets and wakes to doze again  Instead of converse and variety  The same trite round the same stale silent scene  Such are thy comforts blessed Solitude  But Innocence is there but Peace all kind  And simple Quiet with her downy couch  Meads lowing tune of birds and lapse of streams  And Saunter with a book and warbling Muse  In praise of hawthornsLife's whole business this  Is it to bask i'

 To let me pass among thy train  So may I thy vot'ry true  All thy flow'ry paths pursue  Pleased still with thee to meet  In some friendly rural seat  Where I gladsome oft' survey  Nature in her best array  Woods and lawns and lakes between  Fields of corn and hedges green  Fallow grounds of tawny hue  Distant hills and mountains blue  On whose ridge far off appears  A wood the growth of many years  Of aweful oak or gloomy pine  Above th' horizon's level line  Rising black such those of old  Where British druids wont to hold  Solemn assemblies and to keep  Their rites unfolding myst'ries deep  Such that fam'd Dodona's grove  Sacred to prophetic Jove  Oft I admire the verdant steep  Spotted white with many a sheep  While in pastures rich below  Among the grazing cattle slow  Moves the bull with heavy tread  Hanging down his lumpish head  And the proud steed neigheth oft'  Shaking his wanton mane aloft  Or traversing the wood about  The jingling packhorsebells remote  I hear amid the noontide stillness  Sing through the air with brassy shrillness  What time the waggon's cumbrous load  Grates along the grav'lly road  There onward dress'd in homely guise  Some unregarded maiden hies  Unless by chance a trav'lling 'squire  Of base intent and foul desire  Stops to insnare with speech beguiling  Sweet innocence and beauty smiling  Nor fail I joyful to partake  The lively sports of country wake  Where many a lad and many a lass  Foot it on the closetrod grass  There nimble Marian of the green  Matchless in the jig is seen  Allow'd beyond compare by all  The beauty of the rustic ball  While the tripping damsels near  Stands a lout with waggish leer  He if Marian chance to shew  Her taper leg and stocking blue  Winks and nods and laughs aloud  Among the merrymaking crowd  Utt'ring forth in aukward jeer  Words unmeet for virgin's ear  Soon as ev'ning clouds have shed  Their wat'ry store on earth's soft bed  And through their flowing mantles thin  Clear azure spots of sky are seen  I quit some oak's closecover'd bow'r  To taste the boon of newfall'n show'r  To pace the cornfield's grassy edge  Close by a freshblown sweetbriar hedge  While at every green leaf's end  Pearly drops of rain depend  And an earthy fragrance 'round  Rises from the moisten'd ground  Sudden a sunbeam darting out  Brightens the landskip all about  With yellow light the grove o'erspreads  And tips with gold the haycocks' heads  Then as mine eye is eastward led  Some fair castle rears its head  Whose height the country round commands  Well known mark to distant lands  There the windows glowing bright  Blaze from afar with ruddy light  Borrow'd from clouds of scarlet dye  Just as the sun hath left the sky  But if chill Eurus cut the air  With keener wing I then repair  To park or woodland shelter meet  Near some noble's ancient seat  Where long winding walks are seen  Stately oaks and elms between  Whose arms promiscuous form above  High overarch'd a green alcove  While the hoarsevoic'd hungry rook  Near her stickbuilt nest doth croak  Waving on the topmast bough  And the master stag below  Bellows loud with savage roar  Stalking all his hinds before  Thus musing night with even pace  Steals on o'ershad'wing nature's face  While the bat with dusky wings  Flutters round in giddy rings  And the buzzing chaffers come  Close by mine ear with solemn hum  Homeward now my steps I guide  Some rising grassy bank beside  Studded thick with sparks of light  Issuing from many a glowworm bright  While villagecur with minute bark  Alarms the pilf'rer in the dark  Save what light the stars convey  Cluster'd in the milky way  Or scatter'd numberless on high  Twinkling all o'er the boundless sky  Then within doors let me meet  The viol touch'd by finger neat  Or soft symphonies among  Wrap me in the sacred song  Attun'd by Handel's matchless skill  While Attention mute and still  Fixes all my soul to hear  The voice harmonious sweet and clear  Nor let smoothtongu'd Converse fail  With many a welldevised tale  And stories link'd to twist a chain  That may awhile old Time detain  And make him rest upon his scythe  Pleas'd to see the hours so blithe  While with sweet attractive grace  The beauteous housewife of the place  Wins the heart of every guest  By courteous deeds and all contest  Which shall readiest homage shew  To such sov'reign sweetness due  These delights Vacation give  And I with thee will choose to live  To a LADY very handsome but too fond of DRESS  BY THE SAME  PRYTHEE why so fantastic and vain  What charms can the toilet supply  Why so studious admirers to gain  Need beauty lay traps for the eye  Because that thy breast is so fair  Must thy tucker be still setting right  And canst thou not laughing forbear  Because that thy teeth are so white  Shall sovereign beauty descend  To act so ignoble a part  Whole hours at the lookingglass spend  A slave to the dictates of art  And cannot thy heart be at rest  Unless thou excellest each fair  In trinkets and trumpery dress'd  Is not that a superfluous care  Vain idle attempt to pretend  The lily with whiteness to deck  Does the rich solitaire recommend  The delicate turn of thy neck  The glossy bright hue of thy hair  Can powder or jewels adorn  Can perfumes or vermillions compare  With the breath or the blush of the morn  When embarrass'd with baubles and toys  Thou'rt set out so enormously fine  Overdoing thy purpose destroys  And to please thou hast too much design  Little know'st thou how beauty beguiles  How alluring the innocent eye  What sweetness in natural smiles  And what charms in simplicity lie  Thee Nature with beauty has clad  With genuine ornaments dress'd  Nor can Art an embellishment add  To set off what already is best  Be it thine selfaccomplish'd to reign  Bid the toilet be far set apart  And dismiss with an honest disdain  That impertinent Abigail Art  ANACREON ODE III Translated by the Same  IN the dead of the night

close by its side  I set him down by me with napkins I dried  I chaf'd him all over kept out the cold air  And I wrung with my hands the wet out of his hair  He from wet and from cold was no sooner at ease  But taking his bow up he said "If you please  "We will try it I would by experiment know  "If the wet hath not damag'd the string of my bow"  Forthwith from his quiver an arrow he drew  To the string he apply'd it and twang went the yew  The arrow was gone in my bosom it center'd  No sting of a hornet more sharp ever enter'd  Away skipp'd the urchin as brisk as a bee  And laughing "I wish you much joy friend quoth he  "My bow is undamag'd for true went the dart  "But you will have trouble enough with your heart"  An Imitation of HORACE Book III Ode  Angustam amice  c  By Mr TITLEY

About a fig a mighty matter  I could recount a thousand more  But scandal's what I most abhor  Molly who long had patient sat  And heard in silence all their chat  Observing how they spoke with rancour  Took up my cause for which I thank her  What eloquence was then display'd  The charming things that Molly said  Perhaps it suits not me to tell  But faith she spoke extremely well  She first with much ado put on  A prudish face then thus begun  Heyday quoth she you let your tongue  Run on most strangely right or wrong  'Tis what I never can connive at  Besides consider whom you drive at  A person of establish'd credit  Nobody better though I say it  In all that's good so tried and known  Why girls he's quite a proverb grown  His worth no mortal dares dispute  Then he's your brother too to boot  At this she made a moment's pause  Then with a sigh resum'd the cause  Alas my dears you little know  A sailor's toil a trav'ler's woe  Perhaps this very hour he strays  A lonely wretch through desart ways  Or shipwreck'd on a foreign strand  He falls beneath some ruffian's hand  Or on the naked rock he lies  And pinch'd by famine wastes and dies  Can you this hated brother see  Floating the sport of wind and sea  Can you his feeble accents hear  Though but in thought nor drop a tear  He faintly strives his hopes are fled  The billows booming o'er his head  He mounts upon the waves again  He calls on us but calls in vain  To death preserves his friendship true  And mutters out a kind adieu  See now he rises to our sight  Now sinks in everlasting night  Here Fanny's colour rose and fell  And Harriot's throat began to swell  One sidled to the window quite  Pretending some unusual sight  The other left the room outright  While Molly laugh'd her ends obtain'd  To think how artfully she feign'd  The HISTORY of PORSENNA King of RUSSIA IN TWO BOOKS  BY THE SAME  Arva beata  Petamus arma divites et insulas  HOR Epod  BOOK I  IN Russia's frozen clime some ages since  There dwelt historians say a worthy prince  Who to his people's good confin'd his care  And fix'd the basis of his empire there  Inlarg'd their trade the lib'ral arts improv'd  Made nations happy and himself belov'd  To all the neighb'ring states a terror grown  The dear delight and glory of his own  Not like those kings who vainly seek renown  From countries ruin'd and from battles won  Those mighty Nimrods who mean laws despise  Call murder but a princely exercise  And if one bloodless sun should steal away  Cry out with Titus they have lost a day  Who to be more than men themselves debase  Beneath the brute their Maker's form deface  Raising their titles by their God's disgrace  Like fame to bold Erostratus we give  Who scorn'd by less than sacrilege to live  On holy ruins rais'd a lasting name  And in the temple's fire diffus'd his shame  Far diff'rent praises and a brighter fame  The virtues of the young Porsenna claim  For by that name the Russian king was known  And sure a nobler ne'er adorn'd the throne  In war he knew the deathful sword to wield  And sought the thickest dangers of the field  A bold commander but the storm o'erblown  He seem'd as he were made for peace alone  Then was the golden age again restor'd  Nor less his justice honour'd than his sword  All needless pomp and outward grandeur spar'd  The deeds that grac'd him were his only guard  No private views beneath a borrow'd name  His and the public interest were the same  In wealth and pleasure let the subject live  But virtue is the king's prerogative  Porsenna there without a rival stood  And would maintain his right of doing good  Nor did his person less attraction wear  Such majesty and sweetness mingled there  Heav'n with uncommon art the clay refin'd  A proper mansion for so fair a mind  Each look each action bore peculiar grace  And love itself was painted on his face  In peaceful time he suffer'd not his mind  To rust in sloth though much to peace inclin'd  Nor wanton in the lap of pleasure lay  And lost to glory loiter'd life away  But active rising ere the prime of day  Through woods and lonely desarts lov'd to stray  With hounds and horns to wake the furious bear  Or rouze the tawny lion from his laire  To rid the forest of the savage brood  And whet his courage for his country's good  One day as he pursued the dang'rous sport  Attended by the nobles of his court  It chanc'd a beast of more than common speed  Sprang from the brake and through the desart fled  The ardent prince impetuous as the wind  Rush'd on and left his lagging train behind  Fir'd with the chace and full of youthful blood  O'er plains and vales and woodland wilds he rode  Urging his courser's speed nor thought the day  How wasted nor how intricate the way  Nor 'till the night in dusky clouds came on  Restrain'd his pace or found himself alone  Missing his train he strove to measure back  The road he came but could not find the track  Still turning to the place he left before  And only lab'ring to be lost the more  The bugle horn which o'er his shoulders hung  So loud he winded that the forest rung  In vain no voice but Echo from the ground  And vocal woods make mock'ry of the sound  And now the gath'ring clouds began to spread  O'er the dun face of night a deeper shade  And the hoarse thunder growling from afar  With herald voice proclaim'd th' approaching war  Silence awhile ensu'dthen by degrees  A hollow wind came mutt'ring through the trees  Sudden the fullfraught sky discharg'd its store  Of rain and rattling hail a mingled shower  The active lightning ran along the ground  The fiery bolts by fits were hurl'd around  And the wide forests trembled at the sound  Amazement seiz'd the princewhere could he fly  No guide to lead no friendly cottage nigh  Pensive and unresolv'd awhile he stood  Beneath the scanty covert of the wood  But drove from thence soon sallied forth again  As chance directed on the dreary plain  Constrain'd his melancholy way to take  Through many a loathsome bog and thorny brake  Caught in the thicket flound'ring in the lake  Wet with the storm and wearied with the way  By hunger pinch'd himself to beasts a prey  Nor wine to cheer his heart nor fire to burn  Nor place to rest nor prospect to return  Drooping and spiritless at life's despair  He bade it pass not worth his farther care  When suddenly he spied a distant light  That faintly twinkled through the gloom of night  And his heart leap'd for joy and bless'd the welcome sight  Ofttimes he doubted it appear'd so far  And hung so high 'twas nothing but a star  Or kindled vapour wand'ring through the sky  But still press'd on his steed still kept it in his eye  'Till much fatigue and many dangers past  At a huge mountain he arriv'd at last  There lighting from his horse on hands and knees  Grop'd out the darksome road by slow degrees  Crawling or clamb'ring o'er the rugged way  The thunder rolls above the flames around him play  Joyful at length he gain'd the steepy height  And found the rift whence sprang the friendly light  And here he stopp'd to rest his wearied feet  And weigh the perils he had still to meet  Unsheath'd his trusty sword and dealt his eyes  With caution round him to prevent surprize  Then summon'd all the forces of his mind  And ent'ring boldly cast his fears behind  Resolv'd to push his way whate'er withstood  Or perish bravely as a monarch should  While he the wonders of the place survey'd  And through the various cells at random stray'd  In a dark corner of the cave he view'd  Somewhat that in the shape of woman stood  But more deform'd than dreams can represent  The midnight hag or poet's fancy paint  The Lapland witch when she her broom bestrides  And scatters storms and tempests as she rides  She look'd as nature made her to disgrace  Her kind and cast a blot on all the race  Her shrivel'd skin with yellow spots besmear'd  Like mouldy records seem'd her eyes were blear'd  Her feeble limbs with age and palsy shook  Bent was her body haggard was her look  From the dark nook outcrept the filthy crone  And propp'd upon her crutch came tott'ring on  The prince in civil guise approach'd the dame  Told her his piteous case and whence he came  And 'till Aurora should the shades expel  Implor'd a lodging in her friendly cell  Mortal whoe'er thou art the fiend began  And as she spake a deadly horror ran  Through all his frame his cheeks the blood forsook  Chatter'd his teeth his knees together struck  Whoe'er thou art that with presumption rude  Dar'st on our sacred privacy intrude  And without licence in our court appear  Know thou'rt the first that ever enter'd here  But since thou plead'st excuse thou'rt hither brought  More by thy fortune than thy own default  Thy crime though great an easy pardon finds  For mercy ever dwells in royal minds  And would you learn from whose indulgent hand  You live and in whose aweful presence stand  Know farther through yon wide extended plains  Great Eolus the king of tempeus reigns  And in this lofty palace makes abode  Well suited to his state and worthy of the God  The various elements his empire own  And pay their humble homage at his throne  And hither all the storms and clouds resort  Proud to increase the splendor of his court  His queen am I from whom the beauteous race  Of winds arose sweet fruit of our embrace  She scarce had ended when with wild uproar  And horrid din her sons impetuous pour  Around the cave came rushing in amain  Lybs Eurus Boreas all the boist'rous train  And close behind them on a whirlwind rode  In clouded majesty the blust'ring God  Their locks a thousand ways were blown about  Their cheeks like fullblown bladders strutted out  Their boasting talk was of the feats th' had done  Of trees uprooted and of towns o'erthrown  And when they kindly turn'd them to accost  The prince they almost pierc'd him with their frost  The gaping hag in fix'd attention stood  And at the close of every tale cried'Good'  Blessing with outstretch'd arms each darling son  In due proportion to the mischief done  And where said she does little Zephyr stray  Know ye my sons your brother's rout today  In what bold deeds does he his hours employ  Grant heav'n no evil has befall'n my boy  Ne'er was he known to linger thus before  Scarce had she spoke when at the cavern door  Came lightly tripping in a form more fair  Than the young poet's fond ideas are  When fir'd with love he tries his utmost art  To paint the beauteous tyrant of his heart  A satin vest his slender shape confin'd  Embroider'd o'er with flowers of every kind  Flora's own work when first the goddess strove  To win the little wanderer to her love  Of burnish'd silver were his sandals made  Silver his buskins and with gems o'erlaid  A saffroncolour'd robe behind him flow'd  And added grace and grandeur as he trod  His wings than lilies whiter to behold  Sprinkled with azure spots and streak'd with gold  So thin their form and of so light a kind  That they for ever danc'd and flutter'd in the wind  Around his temples with becoming air  In wanton ringlets curl'd his auburn hair  And o'er his shoulders negligently spread  A wreath of fragrant roses crown'd his head  Such his attire but O no pen can trace  No words can shew the beauties of his face  So kind so winning so divinely fair  Eternal youth and pleasure flourish there  There all the little Loves and Graces meet  And every thing that's soft and every thing that's sweet  Thou vagrant cried the dame in angry tone  Where could'st thou loiter thus so long alone  Little thou car'st what anxious thoughts molest  What pangs are lab'ring in a mother's breast  Well do you shew your duty by your haste  For thou of all my sons art always last  A child less fondled would have fled more fast  Sure 'tis a curse on mothers doom'd to mourn  Where best they love the least and worst return  My dear mama the gentle youth replied  And made a low obeisance cease to chide  Nor wound me with your words for well you know  Your Zephyr bears a part in all your woe  How great must be his sorrow then to learn  That he himself's the cause of your concern  Nor had I loiter'd thus had I been free  But the fair princess of Felicity  Intreated me to make some short delay  And ask'd by her who could refuse to stay  Surrounded by the damsels of her court  She sought the shady grove her lov'd resort  Fresh rose the grass the flowers were mix'd between  Like rich embroid'ry on a ground of green  And in the midst protected by the shade  A crystal stream in wild meanders play'd  While in its banks the trembling leaves among  A thousand little birds in concert sung  Close by a mount with fragrant shrubs o'ergrown  On a cool mossy couch she laid her down  Her air her posture all conspir'd to please  Her head upon her snowy arm at ease  Reclin'd a studied carelessness express'd  Loose lay her robe and naked heav'd her breast  Eager I slew to that delightful place  And pour'd a shower of kisses on her face  Now hover'd o'er her neck her breast her arms  Like bees o'er flowers and tasted all her charms  And then her lips and then her cheeks I tried  And fann'd and wanton'd round on every side  O Zephyr cried the fair thou charming boy  Thy presence only can create me joy  To me thou art beyond expression dear  Nor can I quit the place while thou art here  Excuse my weakness madam when I swear  Such gentle words join'd with so soft an air  Pronounc'd so sweetly from a mouth so fair  Quite ravish'd all my sense nor did I know  How long I staid or when or where to go  Meanwhile the damsels debonnair and gay  Prattled around and laugh'd the time away  These in soft notes address'd the ravish'd ear  And warbled out so sweet 'twas heav'n to hear  And those in rings beneath the greenwood shade  Danc'd to the melody their fellows made  Some studious of themselves employ'd their care  In weaving flowery wreaths to deck their hair  While others to some fav'rite plant convey'd  Refreshing showers and cheer'd its drooping head  A joy so general spread through all the place  Such satisfaction dwelt on every face  The nymphs so kind so lovely look'd the queen  That never eye beheld a sweeter scene  Porsenna like a statue fix'd appear'd  And wrapp'd in silent wonder gaz'd and heard  Much he admir'd the speech the speaker more  And dwelt on every word and griev'd to find it o'er  O gentle youth he cried proceed to tell  In what fair country does this princess dwell  What regions unexplor'd what hidden coast  Can so much goodness so much beauty boast  To whom the winged god with gracious look  Numberless sweets diffusing while he spoke  Thus answer'd kindThese happy gardens lie  Far hence remov'd beneath a milder sky  Their nameThe kingdom of Felicity  Sweet scenes of endless bliss enchanted ground  A soil for ever sought but seldom found  Though in the search all human kind in vain  Weary their wits and waste their lives in pain  In diff'rent parties diff'rent paths they tread  As reason guides them or as follies lead  These wrangling for the place they ne'er shall see  Debating those if such a place there be  But not the wisest nor the best can say  Where lies the point or mark the certain way  Some few by Fortune favour'd for her sport  Have sail'd in sight of this delightful port  In thought already seiz'd the bless'd abodes  And in their fond delirium rank'd with gods  Fruitless attempt all avenues are kept  By dreadful foes sentry that never slept  Here fell Detraction darts her pois'nous breath  Fraught with a thousand stings and scatters death  Sharpsighted Envy there maintains her post  And shakes her flaming brand and stalks around the coast  These on the helpless bark their fury pour  Plunge in the waves or dash against the shore  Teach wretched mortals they were doom'd to mourn  And ne'er must rest but in the silent urn  But say young monarch for what name you bear  Your mien your dress your person all declare  And though I seldom fan the frozen north  Yet I have heard of brave Porsenna's worth  My brother Boreas through the world has flown  Swelling his breath to spread forth your renown  Say would you choose to visit this retreat  And view the world where all these wonders meet  Wish you some friend o'er that tempestuous sea  To bear you safe behold that friend in me  My active wings shall all their force employ  And nimbly waft you to the realms of joy  As once to gratify the god of Love  I bore fair Psyche to the Cyprian grove  Or as Jove's bird descending from on high  Snatch'd the young Trojan trembling to the sky  There perfect bliss thou may'st for ever share  'Scap'd from the busy world and all its care  There in the lovely princess thou shalt find  A mistress ever blooming ever kind  All ecstacy on air Porsenna trod  And to his bosom strain'd the little god  With grateful sentiments his heart o'erflow'd  And in the warmest words millions of thanks bestow'd  When Eolus in surly humour broke  Their strict embrace and thus abruptly spoke  Enough of compliment I hate the sport  Of meanless words this is no human court  Where plain and honest are discarded quite  For the more modish title of polite  Where in soft speeches hypocrites impart  The venom'd ills that lurk beneath the heart  In friendship's holy guise their guilt improve  And kindly kill with specious shew of love  For usmy subjects are not us'd to wait  And waste their hours to hear a mortal prate  They must abroad before the rising sun  And hie 'em to the seas there's mischief to be done  Excuse my plainness Sir but business stands  And we have storms and shipwrecks on our hands  He ended frowning and the noisy rout  Each to his several cell went puffing out  But Zephyr far more courteous than the rest  To his own bower convey'd the royal guest  There on a bed of roses neatly laid  Beneath the fragrance of a myrtle shade  His limbs to needful rest the prince applied  His sweet companion slumb'ring by his side  BOOK II  NO sooner in her silver chariot rose  The ruddy morn than sated with repose  The prince address'd his host the God awoke  And leaping from his couch thus kindly spoke  This early call my lord that chides my stay  Requires my thanks and I with joy obey  Like you I long to reach the blissful coast  Hate the slow night and mourn the moments lost  The bright Rosinda loveliest of the fair  That crowd the princess' court demands my care  Ev'n now with fears and jealousies o'erborn  Upbraids and calls me cruel and forsworn  What sweet rewards on all my toils attend  Serving at once my mistress and my friend  Just to my love and to my duty too  Well paid in her well pleas'd in pleasing you  This said he led him to the cavern gate  And clasp'd him in his arms and pois'd his weight  Then balancing his body here and there  Stretch'd forth his agile wings and launch'd in air  Swift as the fiery meteor from on high  Shoots to its goal and gleams athwart the sky  Here with quick fan his lab'ring pinions play  There glide at ease along the liquid way  Now lightly skim the plain with even flight  Now proudly soar above the mountain's height  Spiteful Detraction whose envenom'd hate  Sports with the suff'rings of the good and great  Spares not our prince but with opprobrious sneer  Arraigns him of the heinous sin of fear  That he so tried in arms whose very name  Infus'd a secret panic where it came  Ev'n he as high above the clouds he flew  And spied the mountains less'ning to the view  Nought round him but the wide expanded air  Helpless abandon'd to a stripling's care  Struck with the rapid whirl and dreadful height  Confess'd some faint alarm some little fright  The friendly God who instantly divin'd  The terrors that possess'd his fellow's mind  To calm his troubled thoughts and cheat the way  Describ'd the nations that beneath them lay  The name the climate and the soil's increase  Their arms in war their government in peace  Shew'd their domestic arts their foreign trade  What int'rest they pursued what leagues they made  The sweet discourse so charm'd Porsenna's ear  That lost in joy he had no time for fear  From Scandinavia's cold inclement waste  O'er wide Germania's various realms they past  And now on Albion's fields suspend their toil  And hover for a while and bless the soil  O'er the gay scene the prince delighted hung  And gaz'd in rapture and forgot his tongue  'Till bursting forth at length Behold cried he  The promis'd isle the land I long'd to see  Those plains those vales and fruitful hills declare  My queen my charmer must inhabit there  Thus rav'd the monarch and the gentle guide  Pleas'd with his error thus in smiles replied  I must applaud my lord the lucky thought  Ev'n I who know th'original am caught  And doubt my senses when I view the draught  The slowascending hill the lofty wood  That mantles o'er its brow the silver flood  Wand'ring in mazes through the flow'ry mead  The herd that in the plenteous pastures feed  And every object every scene excites  Fresh wonder in my soul and fills with new delights  Dwells cheerful Plenty there and learned Ease  And Art with Nature seems at strife to please  There Liberty delightful goddess reigns  Gladdens each heart and gilds the fertile plains  There firmly seated may she ever smile  And show'r her blessings o'er her fav'rite isle  But see the rising sun reproves our stay  He said and to the ocean wing'd his way  Stretching his course to climates then unknown  Nations that swelter in the burning zone  There in Peruvian vales a moment staid  And smooth'd his wings beneath the citron shade  Then swift his oary pinions plied again  Cross'd the new world and sought the Southern main  Where many a wet and weary league o'erpast  The wish'dfor paradise appear'd at last  With force abated now they gently sweep  O'er the smooth surface of the shining deep  The Dryads hail'd them from the distant shore  The Nereids play'd around the Tritons swam before  While soft Favonius their arrival greets  And breathes his welcome in a thousand sweets  Nor pale disease nor healthconsuming care  Nor wrath nor foul revenge can enter there  No vapour'd foggy gloom imbrowns the sky  No tempests rage no angry lightnings fly  But dews and soft refreshing airs are found  And pure aetherial azure shines around  Whate'er the sweet Sabaean soil can boast  Or Mecca's plains or India's spicy coast  What Hybla's hills or rich Oebalia's fields  Or flow'ry vale of fam'd Hymettus yields  Or what of old th' Hesperian orchard grac'd  All that was e'er delicious to the taste  Sweet to the smell or lovely to the view  Collected there with added beauty grew  Hightow'ring to the Heavens the trees are seen  Their bulk immense their leaf for ever green  So closely interwove the telltale sun  Can ne'er descry the deeds beneath them done  But where by sits the sportive gales divide  Their tender tops and fan the leaves aside  Like a smooth carpet at their feet lies spread  The matted grass by bubbling fountains fed  And on each bough the feather'd choir employ  Their melting notes and nought is heard but joy  The painted flowers exhale a rich perfume  The fruits are mingled with eternal bloom  And Spring and Autumn hand in hand appear  Lead on the merry months and join to cloath the year  Here o'er the mountain's shaggy summit pour'd  From rock to rock the tumbling torrent roar'd  While beauteons Iris in the vale below  Paints on the rising fumes her radiant bow  Now through the meads the mazy current stray'd  Now hid its wand'rings in the myrtle shade  Or in a thousand veins divides its store  Visits each plant refreshes every flower  O'er gems and golden sands ha murmurs flows  And sweetly soothes the soul and lulls to soft repose  If hunger call no sooner can the mind  Express her will to needful food inclin'd  But in some cool recess or op'ning glade  The seats are plac'd the tables neatly laid  And instantly convey'd by magic hand  In comely rows the costly dishes stand  Meats of all kinds that nature can impart  Prepar'd in all the nicest forms of art  A troop of sprightly nymphs array'd in green  With flow'ry chaplets crown'd come scudding in  With fragrant blossoms these adorn the feast  Those with officious zeal attend the guest  Beneath his feet the silken carpet spread  Or sprinkle liquid odours o'er his head  Others in ruby cups with roses bound  Delightful deal the sparkling nectar round  Or weave the dance or tune the vocal lay  The lyres resound the merry minstrels play  Gay health and youthful joys o'erspread the place  And swell each heart and triumph in each face  So when embolden'd by the vernal air  The busy bees to blooming fields repair  For various use employ their chymic pow'r  One culls the snowy pounce one sucks the flow'r  Again to diff'rent works returning home  Some  Or stive  stipant  steeve the honey some erect the comb  All for the general good in concert strive  And ever soul's in motion every limb's alive  And now descending from his flight the God  On the green turf releas'd his precious load  There after mutual salutations past  And endless friendship vow'd they part in haste  Zephyr impatient to behold his love  The prince in raptures wand'ring through the grove  Now skipping on and singing as he went  Now stopping short to give his transports vent  With sudden gusts of happiness oppress'd  Or stands entranc'd or raves like one possess'd  His mind afloat his wand'ring senses quite  O'ercome with charms and frantic with delight  From scene to scene by random steps convey'd  Admires the distant views explores the secret shade  Dwells on each spot with eager eye devours  The woods the lawns the buildings and the bowers  New sweets new joys at every glance arise  And every turn creates a fresh surprize  Close by the borders of a rising wood  In a green vale a crystal grotto stood  And o'er its side beneath a beechen shade  In broken falls a silver fountain play'd  Hither attracted by the murm'ring stream  And cool recess the pleas'd Porsenna came  And on the tender grass reclining chose  To wave his joys awhile and take a short repose  The scene invites him and the wanton breeze  That whispers through the vale the dancing trees  The warbling birds and rills that gently creep  All join their music to prolong his sleep  The princess for her morning walk prepar'd  The female troops attend a beauteous guard  Array'd in all her charms appear'd the fair  Tall was her stature unconfin'd her air  Proportion deck'd her limbs and in her face  Lay love inshrin'd lay sweet attractive grace  Temp'ring the aweful beams her eyes convey'd  And like a lambent flame around her play'd  No foreign aids by mortal ladies worn  From shells and rocks her artless charms adorn  For grant that beauty were by gems increas'd  'Tis render'd more suspected at the least  And foul defects that would escape the sight  Start from the piece and take a stronger light  Her chesnut hair in careless rings around  Her temples wav'd with pinks and jes'mine crown'd  And gather'd in a silken cord behind  Curl'd to the waist and floated in the wind  O'er these a veil of yellow gauze she wore  With amaranths and gold embroider'd o'er  Her snowy neck half naked to the view  Gracefully fell a robe of purple hue  Hung loosely o'er her slender shape and tried  To shade those beauties that it could not hide  The damsels of her train with mirth and song  Frolic behind and laugh and sport along  The birds proclaim their queen from every tree  The beasts run frisking through the groves to see  The Loves the Pleasures and the Graces meet  In antic rounds and dance before her feet  By whate'er fancy led it chanc'd that day  They through the secret valley took their way  And to the crystal grot advancing spied  The prince extended by the fountain's side  He look'd as by some skilful hand express'd  Apollo's youthful form retir'd to rest  When with the chace fatigued he quits the wood  For Pindus' vale and Aganippe's flood  There sleeps secure his careless limbs display'd  At ease encircled by the laurel shade  Beneath his head his sheaf of arrows lie  His bow unbent hangs negligently by  The slumb'ring prince might boast an equal grace  So turn'd his limbs so beautiful his face  Waking he started from the ground in haste  And saw the beauteous choir around him plac'd  Then summoning his senses ran to meet  The queen and laid him humbly at her feet  Deign lovely princess to behold said he  One who has travers'd all the world to see  Those charms and worship thy divinity  Accept thy slave and with a gracious smile  Excuse his rashness and reward his toil  Stood motionless the fair with mute surprize  And read him over with admiring eyes  And while she stedfast gaz'd a pleasing smart  Ran thrilling through her veins and reach'd her heart  Each limb she scann'd consider'd every grace  And sagely judg'd him of the phoenix race  An animal like this she ne'er had known  And thence concluded there could be but one  The creature too had all the phoenix air  None but the phoenix could appear so fair  The more she look'd the more she thought it true  And call'd him by that name to shew she knew  O handsome phoenix for that such you are  We know your beauty does your breed declare  And I with sorrow own through all my coast  No other bird can such perfection boast  For Nature form'd you single and alone  Alas what pity 'tis there is but one  Were there a queen so fortunate to shew  An aviary of charming birds like you  What envy would her happiness create  In all who saw the glories of her state  The prince laugh'd inwardly surpriz'd to find  So strange a speech so innocent a mind  The compliment indeed did some offence  To reason and a little wrong'd her sense  He could not let it pass but told his name  And what he was and whence and why he came  And hinted other things of high concern  For him to mention and for her to learn  And she 'ad a piercing wit of wond'rous reach  To comprehend whatever he could teach  Thus hand in hand they to the palace walk  Pleas'd and instructed with each other's talk  Here should I tell the furniture's expence  And all the structure's vast magnificence  Describe the walls of shining sapphire made  With emerald and pearl the floors inlaid  And how the vaulted canopies unfold  A mimic heav'n and flame with gems and gold  Or how Felicity regales her guest  The wit the mirth the music and the feast  And on each part bestow the praises due  'Twould tire the writer and the render too  My amorous tale a softer path pursues  Love and the happy pair demand my Muse  O could her art in equal terms express  The lives they lead the pleasures they possess  Fortune had ne'er so plenteously before  Bestow'd her gifts nor can she lavish more  'Tis heaven itself 'tis ecstacy of bliss  Uninterrupted joy untir'd excess  Mirth following mirth the moments dance away  Love claims the night and friendship rules the day  Their tender care no cold indiff'rence knows  No jealousies disturb their sweet repose  No sickness no decay but youthful grace  And constant beauty shines in either face  Benumming age may mortal charms invade  Flowers of a day that do but bloom and fade  Far diff'rent here on them it only blows  The lily's white and spreads the blushing rose  No conquest o'er those radiant eyes can boast  They like the stars shine brighter in its frost  Nor fear its rigour nor its rule obey  All seasons are the same and every month is May  Alas how vain is happiness below  Man soon or late must have his share of woe  Slight are his joys and fleeting as the wind  His griefs wound home and leave a sting behind  His lot distinguish'd from the brute appears  Less certain by his laughter than his tears  For ignorance too oft our pleasure breeds  But sorrow from the reas'ning soul proceeds  If man on earth in endless bliss could be  The boon young prince had been bestow'd on thee  Bright shone thy stars thy Fortune flourish'd fair  And seem'd secure beyond the reach of care  And so might still have been but anxious thought  Has dash'd thy cup and thou must taste the draught  It so befel as on a certain day  This happy couple toy'd their time away  He ask'd how many charming hours were flown  Since on her slave her heav'n of beauty shone  Should I consult my heart cried he the rate  Were small a week would be the utmost date  But when my mind reflects on actions past  And counts its joys time must have fled more fast  Perhaps I might have said three months are gone  Three months replied the fair three months alone  Know that three hundred years have roll'd away  Since at my feet the lovely phoenix lay  Three hundred years reechoed back the prince  A whole three hundred years compleated since  I landed here O whither then are flown  My dearest friends my subjects and my throne  How strange alas how alter'd shall I find  Each earthly thing each scene I left behind  Who knows me now on whom shall I depend  To gain my rights where shall I find a friend  My crown perhaps may grace a foreign line  A race of kings that know not me nor mine  Who reigns may wish my death his subjects treat  My claim with scorn and call their prince a cheat  Oh had my life been ended as begun  My destin'd stage my race of glory run  I should have died well pleas'd my honour'd name  Had liv'd had flourish'd in the list of fame  Reflecting now my mind with horror sees  The sad survey a scene of shameful ease  The odious blot the scandal of my race  Scarce known and only mention'd with disgrace  The fair beheld him with impatient eye  And red with anger made this warm reply  Ungrateful man is this the kind return  My love deserves and can you thus with scorn  Reject what once you priz'd what once you swore  Surpass'd all charms and made ev'n glory poor  What gifts have I bestow'd what favours shewn  Made you partaker of my bed and throne  Three centuries preserv'd in youthful prime  Safe from the rage of death and injuries of time  Weak arguments for glory reigns above  The feeble ties of gratitude and love  I urge them not nor would request your stay  The phantom glory calls and I obey  All other virtues are regardless quite  Sunk and absorb'd in that superior light  Go then barbarian to thy realms return  And shew thyself unworthy my concern  Go tell the world your tender heart could give  Death to the princess by whose care you live  At this a deadly pale her cheeks o'erspread  Cold trembling seiz'd her limbs her spirits fled  She sunk into his arms the prince was mov'd  Felt all her griefs for still he greatly lov'd  He sigh'd he wish'd he could forget his throne  Confine his thoughts and live for her alone  But glory shot him deep the venom'd dart  Was fix'd within and rankled at his heart  He could not hide its wounds but pin'd away  Like a sick flower and languish'd in decay  An age no longer like a month appears  But every month becomes a hundred years  Felicity was griev'd and could not bear  A scene so chang'd a sight of so much care  She told him with a look of cold disdain  And seeming ease as women well can feign  He might depart at will a milder air  Would mend his health he was no pris'ner there  She kept him not and wish'd he ne'er might find  Cause to regret the place he left behind  Which once he lov'd and where he still must own  He had at least some little pleasure known  If these prophetic words awhile destroy  His peace the former balance it in joy  He thank'd her for her kind concern but chose  To quit the place the rest let heav'n dispose  For Fate on mischiefs bent perverts the will  And first infatuates whom it means to kill  Aurora now not as she wont to rise  In gay attire ting'd with a thousand dyes  But sobersad in solemn state appears  Clad in a dusky veil bedew'd with tears  Thick mantling clouds beneath her chariot spread  A faded wreath hangs drooping from her head  The sick'ning sun emits a feeble ray  Half drown'd in fogs and struggling into day  Some black event the threat'ning skies foretel  Porsenna rose to take his last farewel  A curious vest the mournful princess brought  And armour by the Lemnian artist wrought  A shining lance with secret virtue stor'd  And of resistless force a magic sword  Caparisons and gems of wond'rous price  And loaded him with gifts and good advice  But chief she gave and what he most would need  The fleetest of her stud a flying steed  The swift Grisippo said th' afflicted fair  Such was the courser's name with speed shall bear  And place you safely in your native air  Assist against the foe with matchless might  Ravage the field and turn the doubtful fight  With care protect you till the danger cease  Your trust in war your ornament in peace  But this I warn beware whate'er shall lay  To intercept your course or tempt your stay  Quit not your saddle nor your speed abate  'Till safely landed at your palace gate  On this alone depends your weal or woe  Such is the will of Fate and so the Gods foreshew  He in the softest terms repaid her love  And vow'd nor age nor absence should remove  His constant faith and sure she could not blame  A short divorce due to his injur'd fame  The debt discharg'd then should her soldier come  Gay from the field and flush'd with conquest home  With equal ardour her affection meet  And lay his laurels at his mistress' feet  He ceas'd and sighing took a kind adieu  Then urg'd his steed the fierce Grisippo flew  With rapid force outstripp'd the lagging wind  And left the blissful shores and weeping fair behind  Now o'er the seas pursu'd his airy flight  Now scower'd the plains and climb'd the mountain's height  Thus driving on at speed the prince had run  Near half his course when with the setting sun  As through a lonely lane he chanc'd to ride  With rocks and bushes fenc'd on either side  He spied a waggon full of wings that lay  Broke and o'erturn'd across the narrow way  The helpless driver on the dirty road  Lay struggling crush'd beneath th' incumbent load  Never in human shape was seen before  A wight so pale so feeble and so poor  Comparisons of age would do him wrong  For Nestor's self if plac'd by him were young  His limbs were naked all and worn so thin  The bones seem'd starting through the parchment skin  His eyes half drown'd in rheum his accents weak  Bald was his head and furrow'd was his cheek  The conscious steed stopp'd short in deadly fright  And back recoiling stretch'd his wings for flight  When thus the wretch with supplicating tone  And rueful face began his piteous moan  And as he spake the tears ran trickling down  O gentle youth if pity e'er inclin'd  Thy soul to gen'rous deeds if e'er thy mind  Was touch'd with soft distress extend thy care  To save an old man's life and ease the load I bear  So may propitious heaven your journey speed  Prolong your days and all your vows succeed  Mov'd with the prayer the kind Porsenna staid  Too noblyminded to refuse his aid  And prudence yielding to superior grief  Leap'd from his steed and ran to his relief  Remov'd the weight and gave the pris'ner breath  Just choak'd and gasping on the verge of death  Then reach'd his hand when lightly with a bound  The grizly spectre vaulting from the ground  Seiz'd him with sudden gripe th' astonish'd prince  Stood horrorstruck and thoughtless of defence  O king of Russia with a thund'ring sound  Bellow'd the ghastly fiend at length thou'rt found  Receive the ruler of mankind and know  My name is Time thy everdreaded foe  These feet are founder'd and the wings you see  Worn to the pinions in pursuit of thee  Through all the world in vain for ages sought  But Fate has doom'd thee now and thou art caught  Then round his neck his arms he nimbly cast  And seiz'd him by the throat and grasp'd him fast  Till forc'd at length the soul forsook its seat  And the pale breathless corse fell bleeding at his feet  Scarce had the cursed spoiler left his prey  When so it chanc'd young Zephyr pass'd that way  Too late his presence to assist his friend  A sad but helpless witness of his end  He chafes and fans and strives in vain to cure  His streaming wounds the work was done too sure  Now lightly with a soft embrace uprears  The lifeless load and bathes it in his tears  Then to the blissful seats with speed conveys  And graceful on the mossy carpet lays  With decent care close by the fountain's side  Where first the princess had her phoenix spied  There with sweet flowers his lovely limbs he strew'd  And gave a parting kiss and sighs and tears bestow'd  To that sad solitude the weeping dame  Wild with her loss and swoln with sorrow came  There was she wont to vent her griefs and mourn  Those dear delights that must no more return  Thither that morn with more than usual care  She sped but oh what joy to find him there  As just arriv'd and weary with the way  Retir'd to soft repose her hero lay  Now near approaching she began to creep  With careful steps loth to disturb his sleep  'Till quite o'ercome with tenderness she flew  And round his neck her arms in transport threw  But when she found him dead no tongue can tell  The pangs she felt she shriek'd and swooning fell  Waking with loud laments she pierc'd the skies  And fill'd th' affrighted forest with her cries  That fatal hour the palace gate she barr'd  And fix'd around the coast a stronger guard  Now rare appearing and at distance seen  With crowds of black misfortunes plac'd between  Mischiefs of every kind corroding care  And fears and jealousies and dark despair  And since that day the wretched world must own  These mournful truths by sad experience known  No mortal e'er enjoy'd that happy clime  And every thing on earth submits to Time  THE EVERGREEN  BY WILLIAM SHENSTONE Esq  WHEN tepid breezes fann'd the air

then this lime its shelter yield  Protect us when the tempests roar  And winter drives us from the field  Yet faithful then the fir shall last  I smile she cry'd but ah I tremble  To think when my

 Why teize believing nymphs in vain  Go seek some pathless vale  And listen to thy vocal strain  Soft echoing down the dale  While artless Cloe hence retir'd  Shall this sad maxim prove  No bosom once

sacred silence of the night  Loud Chanticleer doth sound his clarion shrill  Hailing with song the first pale gleam of light  That floats the dark brow of yon eastern hill  Bright star of morn oh leave not yet the wave  To deck the dewy frontlet of the day  Nor thou Aurora quit Tithonus' cave  Nor drive retiring darkness yet away  Ere these my rustic hands a garland twine  Ere yet my tongue indite a simple song  For her I mean to hail my Valentine  Sweet maiden fairest of the virgin throng  Sweet is the morn and sweet the gentle breeze  That fans the fragrant bosom of the spring  Sweet chirps the lark and sweeter far than these  The gentle lovesong gurgling turtles sing  Oh let the flowers be fragrant as the morn  And as the turtle's song my ditty sweet  Those flowers my woven chaplet must adorn  That ditty must my waking charmer greet  And thou blest saint whom choral creatures join  In one enlivening symphony to hail  Oh be propitious gentle Valentine  And let each holy tender sigh prevail  Oh give me to approach my sleeping love  And strew her pillow with the freshest flowers  No figh unhallow'd shall my bosom move  Nor step prophane pollute my truelove's bowers  At sacred distance only will I gaze  Nor bid my unreproved eye refrain  Mean while my tongue shall chaunt her beauty's praise  And hail her sleeping with the gentlest strain  "Awake my fair awake for it is time  Hark thousand songsters rise from yonder grove  And rising carol this sweet hour of prime  Each to his mate a roundelay of love  All nature sings the hymeneal song  All nature follows where the spring invites  Come forth my love to us these joys belong  Ours is the spring and all her young delights  For us she throws profusely forth her flowers  Which in fresh chaplets joyful I will twine  Come forth my fair oh do not lose these hours  But wake and be my faithful Valentine  Full many an hour all lonely have I sigh'd  Nor dared the secret of my love reveal  Full many a fond expedient have I tried  My warmest wish in silence to conceal  And oft to far retired solitude  All mournfully my slow step have I bent  Luxurious there indulg'd my musing mood  And there alone have given my sorrows vent  This day resolv'd I dare to plight my vow  This day long since the feast of love decreed  Embolden'd will I speak my flame nor thou  Refuse to hear how sore my heart does bleed  Yet if I should behold my love awake  Ah frail resolves ah whither will ye fly  Full well I know I shall not silence break  But struck with awe almost for fear shall die  Oh no I will not trust a fault'ring speech  In broken phrase an aukward tale to tell  A tale whose tenderness no tongue can reach  Nor softest melody can utter well  But my meek eye best herald to my heart  I will compose to soft and downcast look  And at one humble glance it shall impart  My love nor fear the language be mistook  For she shall read apt scholar at this lore  With what fond passion my true bosom glows  How hopeless of return I still adore  Nor dare the boldness of my wish disclose  Should she then smileyet ah she smiles on all  Her gentle temper pities all distress  On every hill each vale the sunbeams fall  Each herb and flower each tree and shrub they bless  Alike all nature grateful owns the boon  The universal ray to all is free  Like fond Endymion should I hope the moon  Because among the rest she shines on me  Hope vain presumer keep oh keep away  Ev'n if my woe her gentle bosom move  Pity some look of kindness may display  But each soft glance is not a look of love  Yet heav'nly visitant thou dost not quit  Those bow'rs where angels sweet division sing  Nor deignest thou on mortal shrine to sit  Alone for round thee ever on the wing  Glad choirs of love attend and hov'ring wait  Thy mild command of these thy blooming train  Oh bid some sylph in morning dreams relate  Ere yet my love awake my secret pain  THE DOWAGER  BY THE SAME  WHERE aged elms in many a goodly row  Give yearly shelter to the constant crow  A mansion standslong since the pile was rais'd  Whose Gothic grandeur the rude hind amaz'd  For the rich ornament on every part  Confess'd the founder's wealth and workman's art  Though as the range of the wide court we tread  The broken arch now totters o'er the head  And where of old rose high the social smoke  Now swallows build and lonely ravens croak  Though Time whose touch each beauty can deface  Has torn from every tow'r the sculptur'd grace  Though round each stone the sluggard ivy crawls  Yet ancient state sits hov'ring on the walls  Where wont the festal chorus to resound  And jocund dancing frequent beat the ground  Now silence spreads around her gloomy reign  Save when the mastiff clanks his iron chain  Save when his hoarse bark echoes dire alarm  Fierce to protect the place from midnight harm  Its only guard no revel sounding late  Drives the night villain from the lonely gate  An hallow'd matron and her simple train  These solemn battlements alone contain  An hoary dowager whose placid face  Old age has deck'd with lovely aweful grace  With almost vernal bloom her cheek still strow'd  As beauty ling'ring left her lov'd abode  That lov'd abode where join'd with truth and sense  She form'd the features to mute eloquence  And bade them charm the still attentive throng  Who watch'd the sacred lessons of her tongue  For not through life the dame had liv'd retir'd  But once had shone e'en midst a court admir'd  What time the lov'd possessor of her charms  Returning from the war in victor arms  Call'd from his monarch's tongue the plausive praise  While honour wreath'd him with unfading bays  She happy partner of each joyful hour  Then walk'd serene amid the pomp of pow'r  While all confess'd no warrior's wish could move  For fairer prize than such accomplished love  Nor to that love could aught more transport yield  Than graceful valour from the victor field  Thus flourish'd once the beauteous and the brave  But mortal bliss meets the untimely grave  Aurelius diedhis relict's pious tear  O'er his lov'd ashes frequent flow'd sincere  Each decent rite with due observance paid  Each solemn requiem offered to his shade  Plac'd 'mid the brave his urn in holy ground  And bade his hallow'd banners wave around  Then left the gaudy scenes of pomp and power  While prudence beckon'd to that ancient bower  And those paternal fields the sole remains  Of ample woods and farextended plains  Which tyrant custom rudely tore away  To distant heirship an expected prey  Serene she sought the far retired grove  Once the bless'd mansion of her happy love  Pleas'd with the thought that memory oft would raise  A solemn prospect of those blooming days  Aurelius gave her pious purpose now  To keep still constant to her sacred vow  In lonely luxury her sorrows feed  And pass her life in widow's decent weed  One pledge of love her comfort still remain'd  Whom in this solitude she careful train'd  To virtuous lore and while as year by year  New graces made Aurelia still more dear  Full many an hour unheeded she would trace  The father's semblance in the daughter's face  While tender sighs oft heav'd her faithful breast  And sudden tears her lasting love exprest  Thus long she dwelt in innate virtues great  Amid the villages in sacred state  For every grace to which submission bows  The pow'r which conscious dignity bestows  She felt superior for from ancient race  She gloried her long ancestry to trace  And ever bade Aurelia's thought aspire  To every grace each ray of sacred fire  That full of heav'nborn dignity informs  The mortal breast which ardent virtue warms  Then led her to the venerable hall  Where her successive fires adorn'd the wall  And arched windows with their blazon bright  Shed through the herald glow a solemn light  There clad in rough habiliments of war  Full many a hero bore a glorious scar  There in the civic fur the sons of peace  Whose counsels bade their country's tumults cease  While by their side gracing the ancient scene  Hung gentle ladies of most comely mien  Then eager through the wellknown tale she run  In what fair cause each honour had been won  What female grace each virgin had possess'd  To charm to gentle love the manly breast  Pleas'd to observe how long her gen'rous blood  Through fair and brave had pass'd a spotless flood  Mean while the young Aurelia's bosom fir'd  With emulation by each tale inspir'd  In eager transport frequent breath'd her prayer  The graces of her ancestry to share  Nor breath'd in vain her fond maternal guide  Cherish'd with care each spark of virtuous pride  And ever as she gave a lesson new  Would point some old example to her view  Inflam'd by this her mind was quickly fraught  With each sage precept that her mother taught  The goodly dame thus bless'd in her employ  Felt each soft transport of parental joy  And liv'd content her utmost wish fulfill'd  In the fair prospect of a virtuous child  Resign'd she waited now the aweful hour  When death should raise her to that heav'nly bow'r  Where with her lov'd Aurelius she might share  The pleasing task to watch with guardian care  Their offspring's steps and hov'ring o'er her head  The gracious dew of heavenly peace to shed  Nor fear'd her decency of life would prove  An added bliss to all the joys above  ODE TO THE

attached to the measures of Sir Robert Walpole afterwards Lord Orford and generally in possession of some lucrative post under government On reviving the order of the Bath in he had the honour to be named one of the Knights Companions His death happened on August    I  DEAR Colin prevent my warm blushes  Since how can I speak without pain  My eyes have oft told you their wishes  Ah can't you their meaning explain  My passion would lose by expression  And you too might cruelly blame  Then don't you expect a confession  Of what is too tender to name  II  Since yours is the province of speaking  Why should you expect it of me  Our wishes should be in our keeping  'Till you tell us what they should be  Then quickly why don't you discover  Did your breast feel tortures like mine  Eyes need not tell over and over  What I in my bosom confine  SIR WILLIAM YONGE'S ANSWER  I  GOOD madam when ladies are willing  A man must needs look like a fool  For me I would not give a shilling  For

to leave the flaunting town  Can silent glens have charms for thee  The lowly cot and russet gown  No longer dress'd in silken sheen  No longer deck'd with jewels rare  Say canst thou quit each courtly scene  Where thou wert fairest of the fair  O Nancy when thou'rt far away  Wilt thou not cast a wish behind  Say canst thou face the parching ray  Nor shrink before the wintry wind  O can that soft and gentle mien  Extremes of hardship learn to bear  Nor sad regret each courtly scene  Where thou wert fairest of the fair  O Nancy canst thou love so true  Through perils keen with me to go  Or when thy swain mishap shall rue  To share with him the pang of woe  Say should disease or pain befal  Wilt thou assume the nurse's care  Nor wistful those gay scenes recall  Where thou wert fairest of the fair  And when at last thy love shall die  Wilt thou receive his parting breath  Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh  And chear with smiles the bed of death  And wilt thou o'er his breathless clay  Strew flow'rs and drop the tender tear  Nor  then  regret those scenes so gay  Where thou wert fairest of the fair  CYNTHIA AN ELEGIAC POEM  BY THE SAME  Libeat tibi Cynthia mecum  Roscida muscofis antra tenere jugis  PROPERT  BENEATH an aged oak's embow'ring shade  Whose spreading arms with gray moss fringed were  Around whose trunk the clasping ivy stray'd  A lovelorn youth oft pensive would repair  Fast by a Naïd taught her stream to glide  Which through the dale a winding channel wore  The silver willow deck'd its verdant side  The whisp'ring sedges wav'd along the shore  Here oft when Morn peep'd o'er the dusky hill  Here oft when Eve bedew'd the misty vale  Careless he laid him all beside the rill  And pour'd in strains like these his artless tale  Ah would he sayand then a sigh would heave  Ah Cynthia sweeter than the breath of morn  Soft as the gentle breath that fans at eve  Of thee bereft how shall I live forlorn  Ah what avails this sweetly solemn bow'r  That silent stream where dimpling eddies play  Yon thymy bank bedeck'd with many a flow'r  Where mapletufts exclude the beam of day  Robb'd of my love for how can these delight  Though lavish Spring her smiles around has cast  Despair alas that whelms the soul in night  Dims the sad eye and deadens every taste  As droops the lily at the blighting gale  Or  On her left breast  A mole cinquespotted like the crimson drops  I' th' bottom of a cowslip  Shakspeare's Cymbeline Act  crimsonspotted cowslip of the mead  Whose tender stalk alas their stalk so frail  Some hasty foot hath bruis'd with heedless tread  As droops the woodbine when some village hind  Hath fell'd the sapling elm it fondly bound  No more it gadding dances in the wind  But trails its fading beauties on the ground  So droops my soul dear maid downcast and sad  For ever ah for ever torn from thee  Bereft of each sweet hope which once it had  When love when treacherous love first smil'd on me  Return blest days return ye laughing hours  Which led me up the roseat steep of youth  Which strew'd my simple path with vernal flow'rs  And bade me court chaste Science and fair Truth  Ye know the curling breeze or gilded fly  That idly wantons in the noontide air  Was not so free was not so gay as I  For ah I knew not then or love or care  Witness ye winged daughters of the year  If e'er a sigh had learnt to heave my breast  If e'er my cheek was conscious of a tear  'Till Cynthia came and robb'd my soul of rest  O have you seen bath'd in the morning dew  The budding rose its infant bloom display  When first its virgin tints unfold to view  It shrinks and scarcely trusts the blaze of day  So soft so delicate so sweet she came  Youth'sdamask glow just dawning on her cheek  I gaz'd I sigh'd I caught the tender flame  Felt the fond pang and droop'd with passion weak  Yet not unpitied was my pain the while  For oft beside yon sweetbriar in the dale  With many a blush with many a melting smile  She sate and listen'd to the plaintive tale  Ah me I fondly dreamt of pleasures rare  Nor deem'd so sweet a face with scorn could glow  How could you cruel then pronounce despair  Chill the warm hope and plant the thorn of woe  What though no treasure canker in my chest  Nor crowds of suppliant vassals hail me lord  What though my roof can boast no princely guest  Nor surfeits lurk beneath my frugal board  Yet should Content that shuns the gilded bed  With smiling Peace and Virtue there forgot  And roselip'd Health which haunts the strawbuilt shed  With cherub Joy frequent my little cot  Led by chaste Love the decent band should come  O charmer would'st thou deign my roof to share  Nor should the Muses scorn our simple dome  Or knit in mystic dance the Graces fair  The woodland nymphs and gentle fays at eve  Forth from the dripping cave and mossy dell  Should round our hearth fantastic measures weave  And shield from mischief by their guardian spell  Come then bright maid and quit the city throng  Have rural joys no charm to win the soul  She proud alas derides my lowly song  Scorns the fond vow and spurns the rus  et stole  Then Love begone thy thriftless empire yield  In youthful toils I'll lose th' unmanly pain  With echoing horns I'll rouse the jocund field  Urge the keen chace and sweep along the plain  Or all in some lone mossgrown tow'r sublime  With midnight lamp I'll watch pale Cynthia round  Explore the choicest rolls of ancient Time  And heal with Wisdom's balm my hapless wound  Or else I'll roamAh no that sigh profound  Tells me that stubborn love disdains to yield  Nor flight nor Wisdom's balm can heal the wound  Nor pain forsake me in the jocund field  DIALOGUE TO CHLORINDA  BY MR ALSOP  Anthony Alsop the author of this dialogue and of the three subsequent poems was educated in Westminster college and from thence elected to Christ Church in Oxford where he took the degrees of M A March and of  B D  Dec On his coming to the university he was very soon distinguished by Dean Aldrich He passed through the usual offices in his college to that of Censor with considerable reputation and for some years had the principal noblemen and gentlemen belonging to the society committed to his care In this useful employment he continued until his merits recommended him to Sir Jonathan Trelawny Bishop of Winchester who appointed him his chaplain and soon after gave him a prebend in his own Cathedral together with the rectory of Brightwell in the county of Berks which afforded him ample provision for a learned retirement in which he remained to the end of his days and so well satisfied was he with a recluse life that he could not be drawn from it by the repeated solicitations of those who thought him qualified for a more public character and a higher station His death which happened June was occasioned by his falling into a ditch that led to his garden door the path being narrow and part of it giving way under his feet    S  CEASE Chlorinda cease to chide me  When my passion I relate  Why should kindness be denied me  Why should love be paid with hate  If the fruit of all my wishes  Must be to be treated so  What could you do more than this is  To your most outrageous foe  C  Simple Strephon cease complaining  Talk no more of foolish love  Think not e'er my heart to reign in  Think not all you say can move  Did I take delight to fetter  Thrice ten thousand slaves a day  Thrice ten thousand times your betters  Gladly would my rule obey  S  Strive not fairest to unbind me  Let me keep my pleasing chain  Charms that first to love inclin'd me  Will for ever love maintain  Would you send my heart a roving  First to love I must forbear  Would you have me cease from loving  You must cease from being fair  C  Strephon leave to talk thus idly  Let me hear of love no more  You mistake Chlorinda widely  Thus to teize her o'er and o'er  Seek not her who still forbids you  To some other tell your moan  Choose where'er your fancy leads you  Let Chlorinda but alone  S  If Chlorinda still denies me  That which none but she can give  Let the whole wide world despise me  'Tis for her alone I live  Grant me yet this one poor favour  With this one request comply  Let us each go on for ever  I to ask and you deny  C  Since my Strephon you so kind are  All pretensions to resign  Trust ChlorindaYou may find her  Less severe than you divine  Strephon struck with joy beholds her  Would have spoke but knew not how  But he look'd such things as told her  More than all his speech could do  To CHLORINDA  BY THE SAME  SEE Strephon what unhappy fate  Does on thy fruitless passion wait  Adding to flame fresh fuel  Rather than thou should'st favour find  The kindest soul on earth's unkind  And the best nature cruel  The goodness which Chlorinda shews  From mildness and good breeding flows  But must not love be styl'd  Or else 'tis such as mothers try  When wearied with incessant cry  They still a froward child  She with a graceful mien and air  Genteely civil yet severe  Bids thee all hopes give o'er  Friendship she offers pure and free  And who with such a friend as she  Could want or wish for more  The cur that swam along the flood  His mouth well fill'd with morsel good  Too good for common cur  By visionary hopes betray'd  Gaping to catch a fleeting shade  Lost what he held before  Mark Strephon and apply this tale  Lest love and friendship both should fail  Where then would be thy hope  Of hope quoth Strephon talk not friend  And for applyingknow the end  Of every cur's a rope  The FABLE of IXION To CHLORINDA  BY THE SAME  IXION as the poets tell us  Was one of those pragmatic fellows  Who claim a right to kiss the hand  Of the best lady in the land  Demonstrating by dint of reason  That impudence in love's no treason  He let his fancy soar much higher  And ventur'd boldly to aspire  To Juno's high and mighty grace  And woo'd the goddess face to face  What mortal e'er had whims so odd  To think of cuckolding a God  For she was both Jove's wife and sister  And yet the rascal would have kiss'd her  How he got up to heaven's high palace  Not one of all the poets tell us  It must be therefore understood  That he got up which way he could  Nor is it that I know recorded  How bows were made and speeches worded  So leaving this to each one's guess  I'll only tell you the success  But first I stop awhile to shew  What happen'd lately here below  Chlorinda who beyond compare  Of all the fairones is most fair  Chlorinda by the Gods design'd  To be the pattern of her kind  With every charm of face and mind  Glanc'd light'ning from her eyes so blue  And shot poor Strephon through and through  He over head and ears her lover  Try'd all the ways he could to move her  He sigh'd and vow'd and pray'd and cry'd  And did a thousand things beside  She let him sigh and pray and cry on  But now hear more about Ixion  The Goddess proud as folks report her  Disdain'd that mortal wight should court her  And yet she chose the fool to flatter  To make him fancy some great matter  And hope in time he might get at her  Grac'd him with now and then a smile  But inly scorn'd him all the while  Resolv'd at last a trick to shew him  Seeming to yield and so undo him  Now which way do you think she took  For do't she would by hook or crook  Why thus I find it in my book  She call'd a pretty painted cloud  The brightest of the wand'ring crowd  For she you know is queen o'th' air  And all the clouds and vapours there  Governs at will by nod or summons  As Walpole does the house of commons  This cloud which came to her starknaked  She dress'd as fine as hands could make it  For her own wardrobe out she brought  Whate'er was dainty wove or wrought  A smock which Pallas spun and gave her  Once on a time to gain her favour  A gown that ha'n't on earth its fellow  Of finest blue and lin'd with yellow  Fit for a goddess to appear in  And not a pin the worse for wearing  A quilted petticoat beside  With whalebone hoop six fathom wide  With these she deck'd the cloud d'ye see  As like herself as like could be  So like that could not I or you know  Which was the cloud and which was Juno  Thus dress'd she sent it to the villain  To let him act his wicked will on  Then laugh'd at the poor fool aloud  Who for a goddess grasp'd a cloud  This you will say was well done on her  T' expose the tempter of her honour  But more of him you need not hear  Only to Strephon lend an ear  He never entertain'd one thought  With which a goddess could find fault  His spotless love might be forgiven  By every saint in earth and heaven  Juno herself though nice and haughty  Would not have judg'd his passion naughty  All this Chlorinda's self confess'd  And own'd his flame was pure and chaste  Read what his teeming Muse brought forth  And prais'd it far beyond its worth  Mildly receiv'd his fond address  And only blam'd his love's excess  Yet she so good so sweet so smiling  So full of truth so unbeguiling  One way or other still devis'd  To let him see he was despis'd  And when he plum'd and grew most proud  All was a vapour all a cloud  A TALE To CHLORINDA  BY THE SAME  DAME Venus a daughter of Jove's  And amongst all his daughters most fair  Lost it seems to'ther day the two doves  That wafted her car through the air  The dame made a heavy sad rout  Ran about heav'n and earth to condole 'em  And sought high and low to find out  Where the biddyes were stray'd or who stole 'em  To the god who the stragglers should meet  She promis'd most tempting fine pay  Six kisses than honey more sweet  And a seventh far sweeter than they  The proposal no sooner was made  But it put all the Gods in a flame  For who would not give all he had  To be kiss'd by so dainty a dame  To Cyprus to Paphos they run  Where the Goddess oft us'd to retire  Some rode round the world with the sun  And search'd every country and shire  But with all their hard running and riding  Not a God of 'em claim'd the reward  For no one could tell tale or tiding  If the doves were alive or were starv'd  At last the sly shooter of men  Young Cupid I beg the God's pardon  Mamma your blue birds I have seen  In a certain terrestrial garden  Where where my dear child quickly shew  Quoth the dame almost out of her wits  Do but go to Chlorinda's says Cu  And you'll find 'em in shape of pewits  Is it she that hath done me this wrong  Full well I know her and her arts  She has follow'd the thieving trade long  But I thought she dealt only in hearts  I shall soon make her know so I shall  And with that to Jove's palace she run  And began like a bedlam to bawl  I am cheated I am robb'd I'm undone  Chlorinda whom none can appproach  Without losing his heart or his senses  Has stol'n the two doves from my coach  And now flaunts it at Venus' expences  She has chang'd the poor things to pewits  And keeps 'em like ord'nary fowls  So when she robs men of their wits  She turns 'em to asses or owls  I could tell you of many a hundred  Of figure high station and means  Whom she without mercy has plunder'd  Ever since she came into her teens  But her thefts upon earth I'd have borne  Or have let 'em all pass for mere fable  But nothing will now serve her turn  But the doves out of Venus's stable  Is it fit let your mightyship say  That I like some pityful flirt  Should tarry within doors all day  Or else trudge it afoot in the dirt  Is it fit that a mortal should trample  On me who am styl  d queen of beauty  O make her great Jove an example  And teach Nimblefingers her duty  Sir Jove when he heard her thus rage  For all his great gravity smil'd  And then like a judge wise and sage  He began in terms sober and mild  Learn daughter to bridle your tongue  Forbear to traduce with your prattle  The fair who has done you no wrong  And scorns to purloin goods and chattel  She needs neither gewgaw nor trinket  To carry the world all before her  Her deserts I would have you to think it  Are enough to make all men adore her  Your doves are elop'd I confess  And chuse with Chlorinda to dwell  But blame not the lady for this  For sure 'tis no crime to excel  As for them I applaud their high aims  Having serv'd from the time of their birth  The fairest of heavenly dames  They would now serve the fairest on earth  ODE on LYRIC POETRY  By Dr MARRIOT  I  INMATE of smoaking cots whose rustic shed  Within this humble bed  Her twittering progeny contains  The swallow sweeps the plains  Or lightly skims from level lakes the dew  The ringdove ever true  In plaintive accents tells of unrelenting fate  Far from the raven's croak and bird of night  That shrieking wings her flight  When at his mutter'd rite  Hid in the dusky desart vale  With starting eye and visage pale  The grimly wizard sees the spectres rise unholy  But haunts the woods that held her beauteous mate  And wooes the Echo soft with murmurs melancholy  I  Sublime alone the feather'd monarch flies  His nest dark mists upon the mountains shrowd  In vain the howling storms arise  When borne on outstretch'd plume aloft he springs  Dashing with many a stroke the parting cloud  Or to the buoyant air commits his wings  Floating with even sail adown the liquid skies  Then darting upward swift his wings aspire  Where thunders keep their gloomy seat  And lightnings arm'd with heaven's avenging ire  None can the dread artillery meet  Or through the airy region rove  But he who guards the throne of Jove  And grasps the flaming bolt of sacred fire  I  Know with young Ambition bold  In vain my Muse thy dazzled eyes explore  Distant aims where wont to soar  Their burning way the kindling spirits hold  Heights too arduous wisely shun  Humbler flights thy wings attend  For heaventaught Genius can alone ascend  Back to her native sky  And with directed eagle eye  Pervade the lofty spheres and view the blazing sun  II  But hark o'er all the flowerenamel'd ground  What music breathes around  I see I see the virgin train  Unlock their streams again  Rolling to many a vale their liquid lapse along  While at the warbled song  Which holds entranc'd Attention's wakeful ear  Broke are the magic bands of iron sleep  Love wayward child oft wont to weep  In tears his robe to steep  Forgets and Care that counts his store  Now thinks each mighty business o'er  While sits on ruin'd cities war's widewasting glory  Ambition ceasing the proud pile to rear  And sighs unfinish'd leaving half her ample story  II  Then once more sweet enthusiast happy lyre  Thy soothing solace deign awhile to bring  I strive to catch the sacred fire  And wake thee emulous on Granta's plain  Where all the Muses haunt his hallow'd spring  And where the Graces shun the sordid train  Scornful of heavenborn arts which thee and peace inspire  On life's sequester'd scenes they silent wait  Nor heed the baseless pomp of power  Nor shining dreams that crowd at Fortune's gate  But smooth th' inevitable hour  Of pain which man is doom'd to know  And teach the mortal mind to glow  With pleasures plac'd beyond the shaft of Fate  II  But alas th' amusive reed  Ill suits the lyre that asks a master's hand  And fond fancies vainly feed  A breast that life's more active scenes demand  Sloth ignoble to disclaim  'Tis enough the lyre unstring  At other feet the victor palm I fling  In Granta's glorious shrine  Where crown'd with radiance divine  Her smiles shall nurse the Muse the Muse shall lift her fame  ARION an ODE  BY THE SAME  I  QUEEN of each sacred sound sweet child of air  Who sitting thron'd upon the vaulted sky  Dost catch the notes which undulating fly  Oft wafted up to thy exalted sphere  On the soft bosom of each rolling cloud  Charming thy list'ning ear  With strains that bid the panting lover die  Or laughing mirth or tender grief inspire  Or with full chorus loud  Which lift our holy hope or fan the hero's fire  Enchanting Harmony 'tis thine to cheer  The soul by woe which sinks opprest  From sorrow's eye to wipe the tear  And on the bleeding wound to pour the balmy rest  II  'Twas when the winds were roaring loud  And Ocean swell'd his billows high  By savage hands condemn'd to die  Rais'd on the stem the trembling Lesbian stood  All pale he heard the tempest blow  As on the watery grave below  He fix'd his weeping eye  Ah hateful lust of impious gold  What can thy mighty rage withhold  Deaf to the melting powers of Harmony  But ere the bard unpitied dies  Again his soothing art he tries  Again he sweeps the strings  Slowly sad the notes arise  While thus in plaintive sounds the sweet musician sings  III  From beneath the coral cave  Circled with the silver wave  Where with wreaths of emerald crown'd  Ye lead the festive dance around  Daughters of Venus hear and save  Ye Tritons hear whose blast can swell  With mighty sounds the twisted shell  And you ye sister Syrens hear  Ever beauteous ever sweet  Who lull the list'ning pilot's ear  With magic song and softly breath'd deceit  By all the Gods who subject roll  From gushing urns their tribute to the main  By him who bids the winds to roar  By him whose trident shakes the shore  If e'er for you I raise the sacred strain  When pious mariners your power adore  Daughters of Nereus hear and save  IV  He sung and from the coral cave  Circled with the silver wave  With pitying ear  The Nereids hear  Gently the waters flowing  The winds now ceas'd their blowing  In silence listening to his tuneful lay  Around the bark's seabeaten side  The sacred dolphin play'd  And sportive dash'd the briny tide  The joyous omen soon the bard survey'd  Nor fear'd with bolder leap to try the watery way  On his scaly back now riding  O'er the curling billow gliding  Again with bold triumphant hand  He bade the notes aspire  Again to joy attun'd the lyre  Forgot each danger past and reach'd secure the land  HORACE Book II Ode II  Quid bellicosus Cantaber  c Imitated by Lord BATH  William Pulteney  Esq  afterwards the celebrated Earl of Bath was born March He very early was introduced into the House of Commons and distinguished himself in opposition to the last ministry of Queen Anne On the accession of King George the First he was appointed Secretary at War and afterwards Cofferer of the Houshold In he detached himself from his connexions at court and entered so warmly into opposition to the measures of the Crown that on July he was struck out of the list of Privy Counsellors with the King's own hand and at the same time ordered to be put out of every commission of the peace He succeeded at length in his contest with the minister Sir Robert Walpole who in resigned his employments and Mr Pulteney was again sworn of the Pr  vy Council and created Baron of Heydon Viscount Pulteney and Earl of Bath From this period he lost his popularity and during the remainder of George the Second's reign passed his life with little notice or respect from the world At the beginning of the present reign he was much in his Majesty's confidence but enjoyed that honour a very short time He died July at the age of and thereupon his titles became extinct  PAUL  Paul Foley  Esq  to Fazakerly Esq

strength when misapply'd is lost  And what should save urges our ruin most  Just so when beauty prostituted lies  Of bawds the prey of rakes th' abandon'd prize  Women no more their empire can maintain  Nor hope vile slaves of lust by love to reign  Superior charms but make their case the worse  And what should be their blessing proves their curse  O nymph that might reclin'd on Cupid's breast  Like Psyche sooth the God of love to rest  Or if ambition mov'd thee Jove enthral  Brandish his thunder and direct its fall  Survey thyself contemplate every grace  Of that sweet form of that angelic face  Then CLARA say were those delicious charms  Meant for lewd brothels and rude russians arms  No CLARA no that person and that mind  Were form'd by nature and by heaven design'd  For nobler ends to these return though late  Return to these and so avert thy fate  Think CLARA think nor will that thought be vain  Thy slave thy HARRY doom'd to drag his chain  Of love illtreated and abus'd that he  From more inglorious chains might rescue thee  Thy drooping health restor'd by his fond care  Once more thy beauty its full lustre wear  Mov'd by his love by his example taught  Soon shall thy soul once more with virtue fraught  With kind and gen'rous truth thy bosom warm  And thy fair mind like thy fair person charm  To virtue thus and to thyself restor'd  By all admir'd by one alone ador'd  Be to thy HARRY ever kind and true  And live for him who more than dies for you  THE CHEAT'S APOLOGY  BY MR ELLIS  'Tis my vocation Hal  SHAKSPEARE  LOOK round the wide world each profession you'll find  Hath something dishonest which myst'ry they call  Each knave points another at home is starkblind  Except but his own there's a cheat in them all  When tax'd with imposture the charge he'll evade  And like Falstaff pretend he but lives by his trade  The hero ambitious like Philip's great son  Who wept when he found no more mischief to do  Ne'er scruples a neighbouring realm to o'errun  While slaughters and carnage his sabre imbrue  Of rapine and murder the charge he'll evade  For conquest is glorious and fighting his trade  The statesman who steers by wise Machiavel's rules  Is ne'er to be known by his tongue or his face  They're traps by him us'd to catch credulous fools  And breach of his promise he counts no disgrace  But policy calls it reproach to evade  For flatt'ry's his province cajoling his trade  The priest will instruct you this world to despise  With all its vain pomp for a kingdom on high  While earthly preferments are chiefly his prize  And all his pursuits give his doctrine the lye  He'll plead you the gospel your charge to evade  The lab'rer's entitled to live by his trade  The lawyer as oft on the wrong side as right  Who tortures for fee the true sense of the laws  While black he by sophistry proves to be white  And falsehood and perjury lists in his cause  With steady assurance all crime will evade  His client's his care and he follows his trade  The sons of Machaon who thirsty for gold  The patient past cure visit thrice in a day  Write largely the Pharmacop league to uphold  While poverty's left to diseases a prey  Are held in repute for their glitt'ring parade  Their practice is great and they shine in their trade  Since then in all stations imposture is found  No one of another can justly complain  The coin he receives will pass current around  And where he is cousen'd he cousens again  But I who for cheats this apology made  Cheat myself by my rhyming and starve by my trade  SONG  BY THE SAME  AS Chloe ply'd her needle's art  A purple drop the spear  Made from her heedless finger start  And from her eyes a tear  Ah might but Chloe by her smart  Be taught for mine to feel  Mine caus'd by Cupid's piercing dart  More sharp than pointed steel  Then I her needle would adore  Love's arrow it should be  Indu'd with such a subtle pow'r  To reach her heart for me  ANOTHER  BY THE SAME  SUE venal Belinda to grant you the blessing  As Jove courted Danae or vain's your addressing  For love she asserts all that's gen'rous inspires  And therefore rich tokens of love she requires  Such suitors as nothing but ardours are boasting  Will ne'er reach Elysium but ever be coasting  Like pennyless ghosts deny'd passage by Charon  They'll find without fee unrelenting the fairone  But give me the nymph not ungrateful to wooing  Who love pays with love and caresses with cooing  By whom a true heart is accepted as sterling  And Cupid alone makes her lover her darling  TO MR GRENVILLE ON HIS INTENDED RESIGNATION  BY RICHARD BERENGER  Esq  A Wretch tir'd out with Fortune's blows  Resolv'd at once to end his woes  And like a thoughtless silly elf  In the next pond to drown himself  'Tis fit quoth he my life should end  The cruel world is not my friend  I have nor meat nor drink nor cloaths  But want each joy that wealth bestows  Besides I hold my life my own  And when I please may lay it down  A wretched hopeless thing am I  Forgetting as forgot I'll die  Not so said one who stood behind  And heard him thus disclose his mind  Consider well pray what you do  And think what numbers live in you  If you go drown your woes to ease  Pray who will keep your lice and fleas  On you alone their lives depend  With you they live with you must end  On great folks thus the little live  And in their sunshine bask and thrive  But when those suns no longer shine  The helpless insects droop and pine  Oh GRENVILLE then this tale apply  Nor drown yourself left I should die  Compassionate your louse's case  And keep your own to save his place  TO MR GARRICK On his erecting a Temple and Statue to SHAKSPEARE  In his garden by the Thames side at Hampton  BY THE SAME  Viridi in campo signum de marmore ponam  Propter aquam tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat  Th  sis et muliâ praetexit arundine ripas  In med  o mihi  SHAKSPEARE  erit templumque tenebit  VIRGIL  WHERE yonder trees rise high in cheerful air  Where yonder banks eternal verdure wear  And opening flow'rs diffusing sweets around  Paint with their vivid hues the happy ground  While Thames majestic rolls the meads between  And with his silver current crowns the scene  There  GARRICK satiate of wellearn'd applause  From crowds and shouting theatres withdraws  There  courts the Muse turns o'er th' instructive page  And meditates new triumphs for the stage  Thine SHAKSPEARE chieffor thou must ever shine  His pride his boast unequall'd and divine  There  too thy vot'ry to thy merit just  Hath rais'd the dome and plac'd thy honour'd bust  Bidding the pile to future times proclaim  His veneration for thy mighty name  A place more fit his zeal could never find  Than this fair spot an emblem of the mind  As  hill  and  dale there  charm the wond'ring eye  Such sweet variety thy  scenes  supply  Like the tall trees sublime thy genius tow'rs  Sprightly thy fancy as the opening flow'rs  While copious as the tide Thames pours along  Flow the sweet numbers of thy heav'nly song  Serenely pure and yet divinely strong  Look down great shade with pride this tribute see  The hand that pays it makes it worthy thee  As fam'd Apelles was allow'd alone  To paint the form august of Philip's son  None but a GARRICK can O bard divine  Lay a  fit  offering on thy hallow'd shrine  To speak thy worth is his peculiar boast  He best can tell it for he feels it most  Blest bard thy fame through every age shall grow  Till  Nature  cease to charm or Thames to flow  Thou too with him whose fame thy talents raise  Shalt share our wonder and divide our praise  Blended with this thy merits rise to view  And half thy SHAKSPEARE'S fame to thee is due  Unless the actor with the bard conspire  How impotent his strength how faint his fire  One boasts the  mine  one brings the gold to  light  And the Muse triumphs in the Actor's  might  Too weak to give her own conceptions birth  Till allexpressive  Action  call them forth  Thus the sweet pipe mute in itself no sound  Sends forth nor breathes its pleasing notes around  But if some swain with happy skill endu'd  Inspire with animating breath the wood  Wak'd into voice it pours its tuneful strains  The harmony divine enchants the plains  Quod spiro et placeo si placeo tuum est  HOR  On the BirthDay of SHAKSPEARE A CENTO Taken from his Works  BY THE SAME  Naturâ ipsâ valere et mentis viribus excitari et quasi quodam divino spiritu afflari  PEACE to this meeting  Joy and fair time health and good wishes  Now worthy friends the cause why we are met  Is in celebration of the day that gave  Immortal  Shakspeare  to this favour'd isle  The most replenished sweet work of nature  Which from the prime creation e'er she fram'd  O thou divinest Nature how thyself thou blazon'st  In this thy son form'd in thy prodigality  To hold thy mirror up and give the time  Its very form and pressure When he speaks  Each aged ear plays truant at his tales  And younger hearings are quite ravished  So voluble is his discourseGentle  As Zephyr blowing underneath the violet  Not wagging its sweet headyet as rough  His noble blood enchaff'd as the rude wind  That by the top doth take the mountain pine  And make him stoop to th' vale'Tis wonderful  That an invisible instinct should frame him  To loyalty unlearn'd honour untaught  Civility not seen in other knowledge  That wildly grows in him but yields a crop  As if it had been sown What a piece of work  How noble in faculty infinite in reason  A combination and a form indeed  Where every God did seem to set his seal  Heav'n has him nowyet let our idolatrous fancy  Still sanctify his relicks and this day  Stand aye distinguish'd in the kalendar  To the last syllable of recorded time  For if we take him but for all in all  We ne'er shall look upon his like again  An ODE to SCULPTURE  By JAMES SCOT D D  LED by the Muse my step pervades  The sacred haunts the peaceful shades  Where  Art  and  Sculpture  reign  I see I see at their command  The living stones in order stand  And marble breathe through every vein  Time  breaks his hostile scythe he sighs  To find his pow'r malignant fled  "And what avails my dart he cries  "Since these can animate the dead  "Since wak'd to mimic life again in stone  "The patriot seems to speak the hero frown"  There  Virtue's  silent train are seen  Fast fix'd their looks erect their mien  Lo while with more than stoic soul  The  Socrates who was condemned to die by poison  Attic sage  exhausts the bowl  A pale suffusion shades his eyes  'Till by degrees the marble dies  See there the injur'd  Seneca born at Corduba who according to Pliny was orator poet and philosopher He bled to death in the bath  poet  bleed  Ah see he droops his languid head  What starting nerves what dying pain  What horror freezes every vein  These are thy works  O Sculpture  thine to shew  In rugged rock a feeling sense of woe  Yet not alone such themes demand  The  Phydian  stroke the  Daedal  hand  I view with melting eyes  A softer scene of grief display'd  While from her breast the duteous maid  Her  infant sire  with food supplies  In pitying stone she weeps to see  His squalid hair and galling chains  And trembling on her bended knee  His hoary head her hand sustains  While every look and sorrowing feature prove  How soft her breast how great her filial love  Lo there the wild  Semiramis cum ci circa cultum capitis sui occupatae nunciatum esset Babylonem defecisse alterâ parte crinium adhuc solutâ protinus ad eam expugnandam cucurrit nee prius decorem capillorum in ordinem

fury sparkles in her eyes  Thus was her aweful form beheld  When  Babylon  's proud sons rebell'd  She left the woman's vainer care  And flew with loose dishevell'd hair  She stretch'd her hand imbru'd in blood  While pale Sedition trembling stood  In sudden silence the mad crowd obey'd  Her aweful voice and Stygian Discord fled  With hope or fear or love by turns  The marble leaps or shrinks or burns  As  Sculpture  waves her hand  The varying passions of the mind  Her faithful handmaids are assign'd  And rise and fall by her command  When now life's wasted lamps expire  When sinks to dust this mortal frame  She like Prometheus grasps the fire  Her touch revives the lambent flame  While phoenixlike the statesman bard or sage  Spring fresh to life and breathe through every age  Hence where the organ full and clear  With loud hosannas charms the ear  Behold a prism within his hands  Absorb'd in thought great  A noble statue of Sir Isaac Newton erected in TrinityCollege chapel by Dr Smith  Newton  stands  Such was his solemn wonted state  His serious brow and musing gait  When taught on eaglewings to fly  He trac'd the wonders of the sky  The chambers of the sun explor'd  Where tints of thousand hues are stor'd  Whence every flower in painted robes is drest  And varying  Iris  steals her gaudy vest  Here as  Devotion  heavenly queen  Conducts her best her fav'rite train  At  Newton  's shrine they bow  And while with raptur'd eyes they gaze  With  Virtue  's purest vestal rays  Behold their ardent bosoms glow  Hail mighty Mind hail aweful name  I feel inspir'd my lab'ring breast  And lo I pant I burn for fame  Come Science bright etherial guest  Oh come and lead thy meanest humblest son  Through  Wisdom  's arduous paths to fair renown  Could I to one saint ray aspire  One spark of that celestial fire  The leading cynosure that glow'd  While  Smith  explor'd the dark abode  Where  Wisdom  sate on  Nature  's shrine  How great my boast what praise were mine  Illustrious sage who first could'st tell  Wherein the powers of  Music  dwell  And every magic chain untie  That binds the soul of  Harmony  To  thee  when mould'ring in the dust  To  thee  shall swell the breathing bust  Shall here for this reward thy merits claim  "Stand next to place in  Newton  as in fame"  TRUE RESIGNATION  Aequam memento rebus in arduis  Servare mentem  HORAT  By Mr HYLTON  WHEN Colin's good dame who long held him a tug  And defeated his hopes by the help of the jug  Had taken too  freely  the cheeruping cup  And  repeated  the dose 'till it laid her quite up  Colin sent for the doctor with sorrowful face  He gave him his fee and he told him her case  Quoth Galen I'll do what I can for your wife  But indeed she's so bad that I fear for her life  In counsel there's safetye'n send for another  For if she should die folks will make a strange pother  And say that I lost her for want of good skill  Or of better adviceor in short what they will  Says Colin your judgment there's none can dispute  And if physic  can  cure herI know  yours  will do't  But if after all she  should  happen to die  And they say that  you kill'd her  I'll swear 'tis a lye  'Tis the  husband  's chief business whatever ensue  And  whoever  finds faultI'll be shot if  I  do  An EPISTLE from the King of PRUSSIA to Monsieur VOLTAIRE  CROYEZ que si j'etois Voltaire

With cold indiff'rence would I view  Changing Fortune's winged haste  And laugh at her caprice like you  Th' insipid farce of tedious state  Imperial duty's real weight  The faithless courtier's supple bow  The fickle multitude's caress  And the great Vulgar's Littleness  By long experience well I know  And though a Prince and Poet born  Vain blandishments of glory scorn  For when the ruthless shears of Fate  Have cut my life's precarious thread  And rank'd me with th' unconscious dead  What will't avail that I  was  great  Or that th' uncertain tongue of Fame  In Mem'ry's temple chaunts my name  One blissful moment whilst we live  Weighs more than ages of renown  What then do Potentates receive  Of good peculiarly their own  Sweet Ease and unaffected Joy  Domestic Peace and sportive Pleasure  The regal throne and palace fly  And born for liberty prefer  Soft silent scenes of lovely leisure  To what we Monarchs buy so dear  The thorny pomp of scepter'd care  My pain or bliss shall ne'er depend  On fickle Fortune' casual flight  For whether she's my foe or friend  In calm repose I'll pass the night  And ne'er by watchful homage own  I court her smile or fear her

Muse her pensive journey took  Curious to trace the statesman to his home  And moralize at leisure o'er his tomb  She came not with the pilgrim tears to shed  Mutter a vow or trifle with a bead  But such a sadness did her thoughts employ  As lives within the neighbourhood of joy  Reflecting much upon the mighty shade  His glories and his miseries she said  "How poor the lot of the oncehonour'd

Extempore Verses upon a Trial of Skill between the two great Masters of Defence Messieurs FIGG and SUTTON  By Dr BYROM  Dr John Byrom was a younger son of Mr Edward Byrom of Kersal in the county of Lancaster linendraper He received his education at Merchant Taylor's School from whence he went to Trinity College Cambridge where he became a pensioner July Having taken his degrees in arts he was chosen fellow of his college in but not inclining to enter into holy orders he was obliged to quit his place in and soon afterwards married his cousin Miss Elizabeth Byrom This union involved him in more expence than he was able to support and he was compelled to have recourse to teaching shorthand for the maintenance of his family After some years his elder brother died and the family estate devolved to him This occas  ed him first to relax his attention to business and then to relinquish  He died at Manchester September    I  LONG was the great Figg by the prizefighting swains  Sole monarch acknowledg'd of Marybone plains  To the towns far and near did his valour extend  And swam down the river from Thame to Gravesend  Where liv'd Mr Sutton pipemaker by trade  Who hearing that Figg was thought such a stout blade  Resolv'd to put in for a share of his fame  And so sent to challenge the champion of Thame  II  With alternate advantage two trials had past  When they fought out the rubbers on Wednesday last  To see such a contest the house was so full  There hardly was room left to thrust in your skull  With a prelude of cudgels we first were saluted  And two or three shoulders most handsomely fluted  'Till weary at last with inferior disasters  All the company cry'd Come the masters the masters  III  Whereupon the bold Sutton first mounted the stage  Made his honours as usual and yearn'd to engage  Then Figg with a visage so fierce yet sedate  Came and enter'd the lists with his freshshaven pate  Their arms were encircled with armigers too  With a red ribbon Sutton's and Figg's with a blue  Thus adorn'd the two heroes 'twixt shoulder and elbow  Shook hands and went to't and the word it was Bilboe  IV  Sure such a concern in the eyes of spectators  Was never yet seen in our amphitheatres  Our commons and peers from their several places  To half an inch distance all pointed their faces  While the rays of old Phoebus that shot thro' the skylight  Seem'd to make on the stage a new kind of twilight  And the Gods without doubt if one could but have seen 'em  Were peeping there through to do justice between 'em  V  Figg struck the first stroke and with such a vast fury  That he broke his huge weapon in twain I assure you  And if his brave rival this blow had not warded  His head from his shoulders had quite been discarded  Figg arm'd him again and they took t' other tilt  And then Sutton's blade ran away from its hilt  The weapons were frighted but as for the men  In truth they ne'er minded but at it again  VI  Such a force in their blows you'd have thought it a wonder  Every stroke they receiv'd did not cleave 'em asunder  Yet so great was their courage so equal their skill  That they both seem'd as safe as a thief in a mill  While in doubtful attention dame Victory stood  And which side to take could not tell for her blood  But remain'd like the ass 'twixt the bundles of hay  Without ever stirring an inch either way  VII  'Till Jove to the Gods signified his intention  In a speech that he made 'em too tedious to mention  But the upshot on't was that at that very bout  From a wound in Figg's side the hot blood spouted out  Her ladyship then seem'd to think the case plain  But Figg stepping forth with a sullen disdain  Shew'd the gash and appeal'd to the company round  If his own broken sword had not given him the wound  VIII  That bruises and wounds a man's spirit should touch  With danger so little with honour so much  Well they both took a dram and return'd to the battle  And with a fresh fury they made the swords rattle  While Sutton's right arm was observed to bleed  By a touch from his rival so Jove had decreed  Just enough for to shew that his blood was not ichor  But made up like Figg's of the common redliquor  IX  Again they both rush'd with as equal a fire on  Till the company cry'd Hold enough of cold iron  To the quarterstaff now lads So first having dram'd it  They took to their wood and i'faith never shamm'd it  The first bout they had was so fair and so handsome  That to make a fair bargain was worth a king's ransom  And Sutton such bangs on his neighbour imparted  Would have made any fibres but Figg's to have smarted  X  Then after that bout they went on to another  But the matter must end on some fashion or other  So Jove told the Gods he had made a decree  That Figg should hit Sutton a stroke on the knee  Though Sutton disabled as soon as he hit him  Would still have fought on but Jove would not permit him  'Twas his fate not his fault that constrain'd him to yield  And thus the great Figg became lord of the field  A LETTER FROM CAMBRIDGE TO MASTER HENRY ARCHER A YOUNG GENTLEMAN AT ETON SCHOOL  BY DR LITTLETON  Dr Edward Littleton was educated upon the Royal foundation at Eton School from whence he was transplanted to King's College Cambridge in the year After four years residence at the University he was recalled to Eton as an assistant in the school where he so greatly acquired the respect of the provost and fellows that in they elected him into their society and presented him to the living of Maple Derham in Oxfordshire On June the th he was appointed chaplain in ordinary to their Majesties and in the same year took his Doctor of Laws degree at Cambridge He died of a fever in the year and was buried in his own parish church of Maple Derham    THOUGH plagu'd with algebraic lectures  And astronomical conjectures  Wean'd from the sweets of poetry  To scraps of dry philosophy  You see dear  Hal  I've found a time  T' express my thoughts to you in rhyme  For why my friend should distant parts  Or time disjoin united hearts  Since though by intervening space  Depriv'd of speaking face to face  By faithful emissary letter  We may converse as well or better  And not to stretch a narrow fancy  To shew what pretty things  I  can say  As some will strain at simile  First work it fine and then apply  Add Butler's rhymes to Prior's thoughts  And choose to mimic all their faults  By head and shoulders bring in a stick  To shew their knack at hudibrastic  I'll tell you as a friend and irony  How here I spend my time and money  For time and money go together  As sure as weathercock and weather  And thrifty guardians all allow  This grave reflection to be true  That whilst we pay so dear for learning  Those weighty truths we've no concern in  The spark who squanders time away  In vain pursuits and fruitless play  Not only proves an arrant blockhead  But what's much worse as out of pocket  Whether my conduct bad or good is  Judge from the nature of my studies  No more majestic Virgil's heights  Nor tow'ring Milton's loftier flights  Nor courtly Horace's rebukes  Who banters vice with friendly jokes  Nor Congreve's life nor Cowley's fire  Nor all the beauties that conspire  To place the greenest bays upon  Th' immortal brows of Addison  Prior's inimitable ease  Nor Pope's harmonious numbers please  How can poetic flow'rs abound  How spring in philosophic ground  Homer indeed if I would shew it  Was both philosopher and poet  But tedious philosophic chapters  Quite stifle my poetic raptures  And I to Phoebus bade adieu  When first I took my leave of you  Now algebra geometry  Arithmetic astronomy  Optics chronology and statics  All tiresome points of mathematics  With twenty harder names than these  Disturb my brains and break my peace  All seeming inconsistencies  Are nicely solv'd by a's and b's  Our senses are disprov'd by prisms  Our arguments by syllogisms  If I should confidently write  This ink is black this paper white  Or to express myself yet fuller  Should say that black or white's a colour  They'd contradict it and perplex one  With motion light and its reflection  And solve th' apparent falsehood by  The curious texture of the eye  Should I the poker want and take it  When't looks as hot as fire can make it  And burn my finger and my coat  They'd flatly tell me 'tis not hot  The fire say they has in't 'tis true  The pow'r of causing heat in you  But no more heat's in fire that heats you  Than there is pain in stick that beats you  Thus too philosophers expound  The names of odour taste and sound  The salts and juices in all meat  Affect the tongues of them that eat  And by some secret poignant power  Give them the taste of sweet and sour  Carnations violets and roses  Cause a sensation in our noses  But then there's none of us can tell  The things themselves have taste or smell  So when melodious Mason sings  Or Gething tunes the trembling strings  Or when the trumpet's brisk alarms  Call forth the cheerful youth to arms  Convey'd through undulating air  The music's only in the air  We're told how planets roll on high  How large their orbits and how nigh  I hope in little time to know  Whether the moon's a cheese or no  Whether the man in't as some tell ye  With beef and carrots fills his belly  Why like a lunatic confin'd  He lives at distance from mankind  When he at one good hearty shake  Might whirl his prison off his back  Or like a maggot in a nut  Full bravely eat his passage out  Who knows what vast discoveries  From such inquiries might arise  But feuds and tumults in the nation  Disturb such curious speculation  Cambridge from furious broils of state  Foresees her nearapproaching fate  Her surest patrons are remov'd  And her triumphant foes approv'd  No more this due to friendship take  Not idly writ for writing's sake  No longer question my respect  Nor call this short delay neglect  At least excuse it when you see  This pledge of my sincerity  For one who rhymes to make you easy  And his invention strains to please you  To shew his friendship cracks his brains  Sure is a madman if he feigns  THE INDOLENT  WHAT selfsufficiency and false content  Denumb the senses of the indolent  Dead to all purposes of good or ill  Alive alone in an  unactive will  His only vice in  no good action  lies  And his sole virtue is his  want of vice  Business he deems too hard trifles too easy  And doing nothing finds himself too busy  Silence he cannot bear noise is distraction  Noise kills with bustle silence with reflection  No want he feelswhat has he to pursue  To him 'tis less  suffer  than to  do  The  busy  world's a fool the  learn'd  a sot  And his sole hope to be by all forgot  Wealth is procur'd with toil and kept with fear  Knowledge by labour purchas'd costs too dear  Friendship's a clog and family a jest  A wife but a bad bargain at the best  Honour a bubble subject to a breath  And all engagements vain since null'd by death  Thus all the wise esteem he can despise  And  caring not  'tis he alone is wise  Yet all his wish possessing finds no rest  And only lives to know  he never can be blest  THE SONG OF SIMEON PARAPHRASED  BY MR MERRICK  'TIS enoughthe hour is come  Now within the silent tomb  Let this mortal frame decay  Mingled with its kindred clay  Since thy mercies oft of old  By thy chosen seers foretold  Faithful now and stedfast prove  God of truth and God of love  Since at length my aged eye  Sees the dayspring from on high  Son of Righteousness to thee  Lo the nations bow the knee  And the realms of distant kings  Own the healing of thy wings  Those whom death had overspread  With his dark and dreary shade  Lift their eyes and from afar  Hail the light of Jacob's star  Waiting till the promis'd ray  Turn their darkness into day  See the beams intensely shed  Shine o'er Sion's favour'd head  Never may they hence remove  God of truth and God of love  ON THE INVENTION OF LETTERS  TELL me what Genius did the art invent  The lively image of the voice to paint  Who first the secret how to colour sound  And to give shape to reason wisely found  With bodies how to cloath ideas taught  And how to draw the picture of a thought  Who taught the hand to speak the eye to hear  A silent language roving far and near  Whose softest noise outstrips loud thunder's sound  And spreads her accents through the world's vast round  A voice heard by the deaf spoke by the dumb  Whose echo reaches long long time to come  Which dead men speak as well as those alive  Tell me what Genius did this art contrive  THE ANSWER  THE noble art to Cadmus owes its rise  Of painting words and speaking to the eyes  He first in wond'rous magic fetters bound  The airy voice and stopp'd the flying sound  The various figures by his pencil wrought  Gave colour form and body to the thought  ON WIT  TRUE wit is like the brilliant stone  Dug from the Indian mine  Which boasts two various powers in one  To cut as well as shine  Genius like that if polish'd right  With the same gifts abounds  Appears at once both keen and bright  And sparkles while it wounds  ON A SPIDER  BY DR LITTLETON  ARTIST who underneath my table  Thy curious texture hast display'd  Who if we may believe the fable  Wert once a lovely blooming maid  Insidious restless watchful spider  Fear no officious damsel's broom  Extend thy artful fabric wider  And spread thy banners round my room  Swept from the rich man's costly cieling  Thou'rt welcome to my homely roof  Here may'st thou find a peaceful dwelling  And undisturb'd attend thy woof  Whilst I thy wond'rous fabric stare at  And think on hapless poet's fate  Like thee confin'd to lonely garret  And rudely banish'd rooms of state  And as from out thy tortur'd body  Thou draw'st thy slender string with pain  So does he labour like a noddy  To spin materials from his brain  He for some fluttering tawdry creature  That spreads her charms before his eye  And that's a conquest little better  Than thine o'er captive butterfly  Thus far 'tis plain we both agree  Perhaps our deaths may better shew it  'Tis ten to one but penury  Ends both the spider and the poet  THE PLAYTHING CHANGED  KITTY's charming voice and face  Syrenlike first caught my fancy  Wit and humour next take place  And now I doat on sprightly Nancy  Kitty tunes her pipe in vain  With airs most languishing and dying  Calls me false ungrateful swain  And tries in vain to shoot me flying  Nancy with resistless art  Always humorous gay and witty  Has talk'd herself into my heart  And quite excluded tuneful Kitty  Ah Kitty Love a wanton boy  Now pleas'd with song and now with prattle  Still longing for the newest toy  Has chang'd his whistle for a rattle  THE FABLE OF JOTHAM TO THE BOROUGHHUNTERS  By RICHARD OWEN CAMBRIDGE  Esq  Jotham's  fable of the trees is the oldest that is extant and as beautiful as any which have been made since that time  ADDISON  JUDGES Chap ix ver  OLD  Plumb  who though blest in his  Kentish  retreat  Still thrives by his oilshop in  Leadenhallstreet  With a  Portugal  merchant a knight by creation  From a borough in  Cornwall  received invitation  Wellassur'd of each vote well equipt from the alley  In quest of electionadventures they sally  Though much they discours'd the long way to beguile  Of the earthquakes the Jews and the change of the style  Of the Irish the stocks and the lott'ry committee  They came silent and tir'd into  Exeter  city  "Some books prithee landlord to pass a dull hour  "No nonsense of parsons or methodists sour  "No poetical stuff a damn'd jingle of rhymes  "But some pamphlet that's new and a touch on the times"  "O Lord says mine host you may hunt the town round  "I question if any such thing can be found  "I never was ask'd for a book by a guest  "And I am sure I have all the great folk in the  West  "None of these to my knowledge e'er call'd for a book  "But see Sir the woman with fish and the cook  "Here's the fattest of carp shall we dress you a brace  "Would you have any soals or a mullet or place"  "A  place  quoth the knight we must have to be sure  "But first let us see that our Borough's secure  "We'll talk of the  place  when we've settled the poll  "They may dress us for supper the mullet and soal  "But do you my good landlord look over your shelves  "For a book we must have we're so tired of ourselves"  "In troth Sir I ne'er had a book in my life  "But the prayerbook and bible I bought for my wife"  "Well the bible must do but why don't you take in  "Some monthly collection the new magazine"  The bible was brought and laid out on the table  And open'd at  Jotham's  most apposite fable  Sir  Freeport  began with this verse though no rhyme  "The trees of the forest went forth on a time  To what purpose our candidates scarce could expect  For it was not they found to transplantbut ELECT  "To the olive and figtree their deputies came  "But by both were refus'd and their answer the same  "Quoth the olive Shall I leave my fatness and oil  "For an unthankful office a dignify'd toil  "Shall I leave quoth the figtree my sweetness and fruit  "To be envy'd or slav'd in so vain a pursuit  "Thus rebuff'd and surpriz'd they apply'd to the vine  "He answer'd Shall I leave my grapes and my wine  "Wine the sovereign cordial of god and of man  "To be made or the tool or head of a clan  "At last as it always falls out in a scramble  "The mob gave the cry for a bramble a bramble  "A bramble for ever O chance unexpected  "But bramble prevail'd and was duly elected"  "O ho quoth the knight with a look most profound  "Now I see there's some good in  good books  to be found  "I wish I had read this same bible before  "Of long miles at the least 'twould have sav'd us fourscore  "You  Plumb  with your olives and oil might have staid  "And myself might have tarried my wines to unlade  "What have merchants to do from their business to ramble  "Your electioneererrant should still be a bramble"  Thus ended at once the wise comment on  Jotham  And our citizens' jaunt to the borough of  Gotham  AN ELEGY WRITTEN IN AN EMPTY ASSEMBLYROOM  BY THE SAME  Semperque relinque  Sola sibi  VIRG  ADVERTISEMENT  This poem being a parody on the most remarkable passages in the wellknown epistle of  Eloisa  to  Abelard  it was thought unnecessary to transcribe any lines from that poem which is in the hands of all and in the memory of most readers  IN scenes where HALLET'S  Hallet and Bromwich were two eminent upholsterers The

amuse and cheer the mind  Amid this pomp of cost this pride of art  What mean these sorrows in a female heart  Ye crowded walls whose wellenlighten'd round  With lovers sighs and protestations sound  Ye pictures flatter'd by the learn'd and wise  Ye glasses ogled by the brightest eyes  Ye cards which beauties by their touch have blest  Ye chairs which peers and ministers have prest  How are ye

erring footman with th' unerring card  'Twas VENUS sure for by their faithful aid  The whisp'ring lover meets the blushing maid  From solitude they give the cheerful call  To the choice supper or the sprightly ball  Speed the soft summons of the gay and fair  From distant Bloomsbury to Grosvenor's square  And bring the colonel to the tender hour  From the parade the senate or the Tower  Ye records patents of our worth and pride  Our daily lesson and our nightly guide  Where'er ye stand dispos'd in proud array  The vapours vanish and the heart is gay  But when no cards the chimneyglass adorn  The dismal void with heartfelt shame we mourn  Conscious neglect inspires a sullen gloom  And brooding sadness fills the slighted room  If but some happier female's card I've seen  I swell with rage or sicken with the spleen  While artful pride conceals the bursting tear  With some forc'd banter or affected sneer  But now grown desp'rate and beyond all hope  I curse the ball the dutchess and the pope  And as the loads of borrow'd plate go by  Tax it ye greedy ministers I cry  How shall I feel when Sol resigns his light  To this proud splendid goddess of the night  Then when her aukward guests in measure beat  The crowded floors which groan beneath their feet  What thoughts in solitude shall then possess  My tortur'd mind or soften my distress  Not all that envious malice can suggest  Will sooth the tumults of my raging breast  For envy's lost amid the numerous train  And hisses with her hundred snakes in vain  Though with contempt each despicable soul  Singly I viewI must revere the

And clasp the regimentals in my arms  To dream last night I clos'd my blubber'd eyes  Ye soft allusions dear deceits arise  Alas no more Methinks I wand'ring go  To distant quarters 'midst the

canting no sly jesuitical arts  Fieldpreaching hypocrisy learning or parts  By a happy refinement in mortification  Grew the oracle saint and the pope of his nation  But what did he do this esteem to acquire  Did he torture his head or his bosom with fire  Was his neck in a portable pillory cas'd  Did he fasten a chain to his leg or his waist  No His holiness rose to his sovereign pitch  By the merit of running long nails in his breech  A wealthy young Indian approaching the shrine  Thus in banter accosts the prophetic divine  This tribute accept for your int'rest with FO  Whom with torture you serve and whose will you must know  To your suppliant disclose his immortal decree  Tell me which of the heav'ns is allotted for me  FAKEER  Let me first know your merits  INDIAN  I strive to be just  To be true to my friend to my wife to my trust  In religion I duly observe every form  With a heart to my country devoted and warm  I give to the poor and I lend to the rich  FAKEER  But how many nails do you run in your breech  INDIAN  With submission I speak to your rev'rence's tail  But mine has no taste for a tenpenny nail  FAKEER  Well I'll pray to our prophet and get you preferr'd  Though no farther expect than to heaven the third  With me in the thirtieth your seat to obtain  You must qualify duly with hunger and pain  INDIAN  With you in the thirtieth you impudent rogue  Can such wretches as you give to madness a vogue  Though the priesthood of FO on the vulgar impose  By squinting whole years at the end of their nose  Though with cruel devices of mortification  They adore a vain idol of modern creation  Does the God of the heav'ns such a service direct  Can his mercy approve a selfpunishing sect  Will his wisdom be worship'd with chains and with nails  Or e'er look for his rites in your noses and tails  Come along to my house and these penances leave  Give your belly a feast and your breech a reprieve  This reasoning unhing'd each fanatical notion  And stagger'd our saint in his chair of promotion  At length with reluctance he rose from his seat  And resigning his nails and his fame for retreat  Two weeks his new life he admir'd and enjoy'd  The third he with plenty and quiet was cloy'd  To live undistinguish'd to him was the pain  An existence unnotic'd he could not sustain  In retirement he sigh'd for the famegiving chair  For the crowd to admire him to rev'rence and stare  No endearments of pleasure and ease could prevail  He the saintship resum'd and new larded his tail  Our FAKEER represents all the vot'ries of fame  Their ideas their means and their end is the same  The sportsman the buck all the heroes of vice  With their gallantry lewdness the bottle and dice  The poets the critics the metaphysicians  The courtier the patriot all politicians  The statesman begirt with th' importunate ring  I had almost compleated my list with the king  All labour alike to illustrate my tale  All tortur'd by choice with th' invisible nail  To Mr WHITEHEAD On his being made POET LAUREAT  BY THE SAME  'TIS sothough we're surpris'd to hear it  The laurel is bestow'd on merit  How hush'd is every envious voice  Confounded by so just a choice  Though by prescriptive right prepar'd  To libel the selected bard  But as you see the statesman's fate  In this our democratic state  Whom virtue strives in vain to guard  From the rude pamphlet and the card  You'll find the demagogues of Pindus  In envy not a jot behind us  For each Aonian politician  Whose element is opposition  Will shew how greatly they surpass us  In gall and wormwood at Parnassus  Thus as the same detracting spirit  Attends on all distinguish'd merit  When 'tis your turn observe the quarrel  Is not with you but with the laurel  Suppose that laurel on your brow  For cypress chang'd funereal bough  See all things take a diff'rent turn  The very critics sweetly mourn  And leave their satire's pois'nous sting  In plaintive elegies to sing  With solemn threnody and dirge  Conduct you to Elysium's verge  At Westminster the surplic'd dean  The sad but honourable scene  Prepares The wellattended herse  Bears you amid the kings of verse  Each rite observ'd each duty paid  Your fame on marble is display'd  With symbols which your genius suit  The mask the buskin and the flute  The laurel crown aloft is hung  And o'er the sculptur'd lyre unstrung  Sad allegoric figures leaning  How folks will gape to find their meaning  And a long epitaph is spread  Which happy You will never read  But holdThe change is so inviting  I own I tremble while I'm

And how a Briton write to kings  VERSES on the Prospect of planting ARTS and LEARNING in AMERICA  BY Dr BERKELEY Bishop of CLOYNE  Written about the year when the author had in view the scheme of founding a college at Bermudas which failed of success in the attempt    THE Muse disgusted at an age and clime  Barren of every glorious theme  In distant lands now waits a better time  Producing subjects worthy fame  In happy climes where from the genial sun  And virgin earth such scenes ensue  The force of art by nature seems outdone  And fancied beauties by the true  In happy climes the seat of innocence  Where nature guides and virtue rules  Where men shall not impose for truth and sense  The pedantry of courts and schools  There shall be sung another golden age  The rise of empire and of arts  The good and great inspiring epic rage  The wisest heads and noblest hearts  Not such as Europe breeds in her decay  Such as she bred when fresh and young  When heav'nly flame did animate her clay  By future poets shall be sung  Westward the course of empire takes its way  The four first acts already past  A fifth shall close the drama with the day  Time's noblest offspring is the last  To Mr MASON  By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD  Esq  I  BELIEVE me MASON 'tis in vain  Thy fortitude the torrent braves  Thou too must bear th' inglorious chain  The world the world will have its slaves  The chosen friend for converse sweet  The small yet elegant retreat  Are peaceful unambitious views  Which early fancy loves to form  When aided by the ingenuous Muse  She turns the philosophic page  And sees the wise of every age  With Nature's dictates warm  II  But ah to few has Fortune given  The choice to take or to refuse  To fewer still indulgent Heaven  Allots the very will to chuse  And why are varying schemes preferr'd  Man mixes with the common herd  By custom guided to pursue  Or wealth or honors fame or ease  What others wish he wishes too  Nor from his own peculiar choice  'Till strengthen'd by the public voice  His very pleasures please  III  How oft beneath some hoary shade  Where Cam glides indolently slow  Hast thou as indolently laid  Preferr'd to Heav'n thy fav'rite vow  "Here here for ever let me stay  "Here calmly loiter life away  "Nor all those vain connections know  "Which fetter down the freeborn mind  "The slave of interest or of shew  "Whilst yon gay tenant of the grove  "The happier heir of Nature's love  "Can warble unconfin'd"  IV  Yet sure my friend th' eternal plan  By Truth unerring was design'd  Inferior parts were made for man  But man himself for all mankind  Then by th' apparent judge th' unseen  Behold how rolls this vast machine  To one great end howe'er withstood  Directing its impartial course  All labour for the general good  Some stem the wave some till the soil  By choice the bold th' ambitious toil  The indolent by force  V  That bird thy fancy frees from care  With many a fear unknown to thee  Must rove to glean his scanty fare  From field to field from tree to tree  His lot united with his kind  Has all his little joys confin'd  The Lover's and the Parent's ties  Alarm by turns his anxious breast  Yet bound by fate by instinct wise  He hails with songs the rising morn  And pleas'd at evening's cool return  He sings himself to rest  VI  And tell me has not Nature made  Some stated void for thee to fill  Some spring some wheel which asks thy aid  To move regardless of thy will  Go then go feel with glad surprise  New bliss from new connections rise  'Till happier in thy wider sphere  Thou quit thy darling schemes of ease  Nay glowing in the full career  Ev'n wish thy virtuous labours more  Nor 'till the toilsome day is o'er  Expect the night of peace  ODE To INDEPENDENCY  By Mr MASON  I  HERE on my native shore reclin'd  While Silence rules the midnight hour  I woo thee GODDESS On my musing mind  Descend propitious Power  And bid these ruffling gales of grief subside  Bid my calm'd soul with all thy influence shine  As yon chaste Orb along this ample tide  Draws the long lustre of her silver line  While the hush'd breeze its last weak whisper blows  And lulls old HUMBER to his deep repose  II  Come to thy Vot'ry's ardent prayer  In all thy graceful plainness drest  No knot confines thy waving hair  No zone thy floating vest  Unsullied Honor decks thine open brow  And Candor brightens in thy modest eye  Thy blush is warm Content's aetherial glow  Thy smile is Peace thy step is Liberty  Thou scatter'st blessings round with lavish hand  As Spring with careless fragrance fills the land  III  As now o'er this lone beach I stray  Thy  Andrew Marvell born at Kingston upon Hull in the year  fav'rite Swain oft stole along  And artless wove his Doric lay  Far from the busy throng  Thou heard'st him Goddess strike the tender string  And bad'st his soul with bolder passions move  Strait these responsive shores forgot to ring  With Beauty's praise or plaint of slighted Love  To loftier flights his daring Genius rose  And led the war 'gainst thine and Freedom's foes  IV  Pointed with Satire's keenest steel  The shafts of Wit he darts around  Ev'n  Parker bishop of Oxford  mitred Dulness learns to feel  And shrinks beneath the wound  In awful poverty his honest Muse  Walks forth vindictive through a venal land  In vain Corruption sheds her golden dews  In vain Oppression lifts her iron hand  He scorns them both and arm'd with truth alone  Bids Lust and Folly tremble on the throne  V  Behold like him immortal Maid  The Muses vestal fires I bring  Here at thy feet the sparks I spread  Propitious wave thy wing  And fan them to that dazzling blaze of Song  That glares tremendous on the Sons of Pride  But hark methinks I hear her hallow'd tongue  In distant trills it echoes o'er the tide  Now meets mine ear with warbles wildly free  As swells the lark's meridian ecstacy  VI  "Fond Youth to MARVELL'S patriot fame  "Thy humble breast must ne'er aspire  "Yet nourish still the lambent flame  "Still strike thy blameless lyre  "Led by the moral Muse securely rove  "And all the vernal sweets thy vacant Youth  "Can cull from busy Fancy's fairy grove  "O hang their foliage round the fane of Truth  "To arts like these devote thy tuneful toil  "And meet its fair reward in D'ARCY'S smile"  VII  "'Tis he my Son alone shall cheer  "Thy sick'ning soul at that sad hour  "When

"Winding thy blasted tendrils o'er the plain  "At that sad hour shall D'ARCY lend his aid  "And raise with Friendship's arm thy drooping head  VIII  "This fragrant wreath the Muses meed  "That bloom'd

AH cease this kind persuasive strain  Which when it flows from friendship's tongue  However weak however vain  O'erpowers beyond the Siren's song  Leave me my friend indulgent go  And let me muse upon my woe  Why lure me from these pale retreats  Why rob me of these pensive sweets  Can Music's voice can Beauty's eye  Can Painting's glowing hand supply  A charm so suited to my mind  As blows this hollow gust of wind  As drops this little weeping rill  Softtinkling down the mossgrown hill  Whilst through the west where sinks the crimson Day  Meek Twilight slowly sails and waves her banners grey  II  Say from Affliction's various source  Do none but turbid waters flow  And cannot Fancy clear their course  For Fancy is the friend of Woe  Say 'mid that grove in lovelorn state  When yon poor Ringdove mourns her mate  Is all that meets the shepherd's ear  Inspir'd by anguish and despair  Ah no fair Fancy rules the song  She swells her throat she guides her tongue  She bids the waving Aspin spray  Quiver in cadence to her lay  She bids the fringed Osiers bow  And rustle round the lake below  To suit the tenor of her gurgling sighs  And sooth her throbbing breast with solemn sympathies  III  To thee whose young and polish'd brow  The wrinkling hand of Sorrow spares  Whose cheeks bestrew'd with roses know  No channel for the tide of tears  To thee yon Abbey dank and lone  Where Ivy chains each mould'ring stone  That nods o'er many a Martyr's tomb  May cast a formidable gloom  Yet some there are who free from fear  Could wander through the cloysters drear  Could rove each desolated Isle  Though midnight thunders shook the pile  And dauntless view or seem to view  As faintly flash the lightnings blue  Thin shiv'ring Ghosts from yawning charnels throng  And glance with silent sweep the shaggy vaults along  IV  But such terrific charms as these  I ask not yet My sober mind  The fainter forms of Sadness please  My sorrows are of softer kind  Through this still valley let me stray  Wrapt in some strain of pensive GRAY  Whose lofty Genius bears along  The conscious dignity of Song  And scorning from the sacred store  To waste a note on Pride or Power  Roves when the glimmering twilight glooms  And warbles 'mid the rustic tombs  He too perchance for well I know  His heart would melt with friendly woe  He too perchance when these poor limbs are laid  Will heave one tuneful sigh and sooth my hov'ring shade  ODE  By Mr GRAY    PINDAR Olymp II  I  AWAKE Aeolian lyre awake  IMITATION  Awake my glory awake lute and harp  David's Psalms  VARIATION  In Mr Gray's manuscript it originally stood  Awake my lyre my glory wake  M    And give to rapture all thy trembling strings  From Helicon's harmonious springs  The subject and simile as usual with Pindar are united The various sources of poetry which gives life and lustre to all it touches are here described its quiet majestic progress enriching every subject otherwise dry and barren with a pomp of diction and luxuriant harmony of numbers and its more rapid and irresistible course when swoln and hurried away by the conflict of tumultuous passions G  A thousand rills their mazy progress take  The laughing flowers that round them blow  Drink life and fragrance as they flow  Now the rich stream of music winds along  Deep majestic smooth and strong  Through verdant vales and Ceres' golden reign  Now rolling down the steep amain  Headlong impetuous see it pour  The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar  I  Oh Sovereign of the willing soul  Power of harmony to calm the turbulent sallies of the soul The thoughts are borrowed from the first Pythian of Pindar G    Parent of sweet and solemnbreathing airs  Enchanting shell the sullen Cares  And frantic Passions hear thy soft controul  On Thracia's hills the Lord of War  Has curb'd the fury of his car  And dropp'd his thirsty lance at thy command  This description of the Bird of Jupiter Mr Gray in his own edition modestly calls  a weak imitation of some incomparable lines in the first Pythian of Pindar  but if they are compared with Mr Gilbert West's translation of the above lines though far from a bad one their superior energy to his version will appear very conspicuous  Perch'd on the sceptre of th' Olympian king  The thrilling darts of harmony he feels  And indolently hangs his rapid wing  While gentle sleep his closing eyelid seals  And o'er his heaving limbs in loose array  To every balmy gale the ruffling feathers play  Here if we except the second line we find no imagery or expression of the lyrical cast The rest are loaded with unnecessary epithets and would better suit the tamers tones of elegy M  Perching on the scepter'd hand  Of Jove thy magic lulls the feather'd king  With ruffled plumes and flagging wing  Quench'd in dark clouds of slumber lie  The terror of his beak and lightnings of his eye  I  Power of harmony to produce all the graces of motion in the body G  Thee the voice the dance obey  Temper'd to thy warbled lay  O'er Idalia's velvetgreen  The rosycrowned Loves are seen  On Cytherea's day  With antic Sports and blueeyed Pleasures  Frisking light in frolic measures  Now pursuing now retreating  Now in circling troops they meet  To brisk notes in cadence beating  IMITATION    Homer's Od  Θ G  Glance their manytwinkling feet  Slow  This and the five following lines which follow are sweetly introduced by the short and unequal measures that precede them the whole stanza is indeed a masterpiece of rhythm and charms the ear by its wellvaried cadence as much as the imagery which it contains ravishes the fancy  There is says our author in one of his manuscript papers  a toute ensemble  of sound as well as of sense in poetical composition always necessary to its perfection What is gone before still dwells upon the ear and insensibly harmonizes with the present line as in that succession of fleeting notes which is called melody  Nothing "can better exemplify the truth of this fine observation than his own poetry M  melting strains their Queen's approach declare  Where'er she turns the Graces homage pay  With arms sublime that float upon the air  In gliding state she wins her easy way  O'er her warm cheek and rising bosom move  IMITATION  Phryniebus apud Athenaeum  The bloom of young Desire and purple light of Love  II  To compensate the real and imaginary ills of life the Muse was given to mankind by the same Providence that sends the day by its chearful presence to dispel the gloom and terrors of the night G  Man's feeble race what Ills await  Labour and Penury the racks of Pain  Disease and Sorrow's weeping train  And Death sad refuge from the storms of Fate  The fond complaint my Song disprove  And justify the laws of Jove  Say has he given in vain the heav'nly Muse  Night and all her sickly dews  Her Spectres wan and Birds of boding cry  He gives to range the dreary sky  IMITATION  Or seen the morning's wellappointed star  Come marching up the eastern hills afar  Cowley  'Till down the eastern cliffs afar  Hyperion's march they spy and glitt'ring shafts of war  II  Extensive influence of poetic genius over the remotest and most uncivilized nations its connection with liberty and the virtues that naturally attend on it See the Erse Norwegian and Welch Fragments the Lapland and American Songs G IMITATION  Extra anni solisque vias  Virgil  Tutta lontana dal carmin del sole  Petrarch Canzon  ii  In climes beyond the solar road  Where shaggy forms o'er icebuilt mountains roam  The Muse has broke the twilight gloom  To cheer the shiv'ring Native's dull abode  And oft beneath the od'rous shade  Of Chili's boundless forests laid  She deigns to hear the savage Youth repeat  In loose numbers wildly sweet  Their feathercinctured Chiefs and dusky Loves  Her tract where'er the Goddess roves  Glory pursue and generous Shame  Th' unconquerable Mind and Freedom's holy flame  II  Progress of poetry from Greece to Italy and from Italy to England Chaucer was not unacquainted with the writings of Dante or of Petrarch The Earl of Surrey and Sir Thomas Wyatt had travelled in Italy and formed their taste there Spenser imitated the Italian writers Milton improved on them but this school expired soon after the Restoration and a new one arose on the French model which has subsisted ever since G  Woods that wave o'er Delphi's steep  Isles that crown the Egaean deep  Fields that cool Illissus laves  Or where Maeander's amber waves  In lingering Lab'rinths creep  How do your tuneful Echo's languish  Mute but to the voice of Anguish  Where each old poetic Mountain  Inspiration breath'd around  Every shade and hallow'd Fountain  Murmur'd deep a solemn sound  'Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hour  Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains  Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrantPower  And coward Vice that revels in her chains  When Latium had her lofty spirit lost  They sought oh Albion next thy seaencircled coast  III  An ingenious person who sent Mr Gray his remarks anonymously on this and the following ode soon after they were published gives this stanza and the following a very just and wellexpressed eulogy  A poet is perhaps never more conciliating than when he praises favourite predecessors in his art Milton is not more the pride than Shakspeare the love of their country it is therefore equally judicious to diffuse a tenderness and a grace through the praise of Shakspeare as to extol in a strain more elevated and sonorous the boundless soarings of Milton's epic imagination  The critic has here well noted the beauty of contrast which results from the two descriptions yet it is further to be observed to the honor of our poet's judgment that the tenderness and grace in the former does not prevent it from strongly characterizing the three capital persections of Shakspeare's genius and when he describes his power of exciting terror a species of the sublime he ceases to be diffuse and becomes as he ought to be concise and energetical M  Far from the sun and summergale  In thy green lap was Nature's Darling  Shakspeare G  laid  What time where lucid Avon stray'd  To Him the mighty mother did unveil  Her aweful face The dauntless Child  Stretch'd forth his little arms and smil'd  This pencil take she said whose colours dear  Richly paint the vernal year  Thine too these golden keys immortal Boy  This can unlock the gates of Joy  Or Horrour that and thrilling Fears  Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic Tears  III  Nor second He  Milton G  that rode sublime  Upon the seraphwings of Extasy  The secrets of th' Abyss to spy  IMITATION  Flammantia moenia mundi  Lucretius  He pass'd the flaming bounds of Place and Time  IMITATION  For the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphirestonethis was the appearance of the glory of the Lord  Ezekiel  i  The living Throne the sapphireblaze  Where Angels tremble while they gaze  He saw but blasted with excess of light  IMITATION    Homer Od  G  This has been condemned as a false thought and more worthy of an Italian poet than of Mr Gray Count Algarotti we have found in his letter to Mr How praises it highly but as he was an Italian critic his judgment in this point will not perhaps by many be thought to overbalance the objection The truth is that this fiction of the cause of Milton's blindness is not beyond the bounds of poetical credibility any more than the fiction which precedes it concerning the birth of Shakspeare and therefore would be equally admissible had it not the peculiar misfortune to encounter a fact too well known on this account the judgment revolts against it Milton himself has told us in a strain of heartfelt exultation see his Sonnet to Cyriac Skynner that he lost his eyesight  overply'd  IN LIBERTY'S DEFENCE  his  noble task  Whereof all Europe rings from side to side  And when we know this to have been the true cause we cannot admit a fictitious one however sublimely conceived or happily expressed If therefore so lofty and unrivalled a description will not atone for this acknowledged defect in relation to matter of fact all that the impartial critic can do is to point out the reason and to apologize for the poet who was necessitated by his subject to consider Milton only in his poetical capacity  Since the above note was published Mr Brand of EastDearham in Norfolk has favoured me with a letter in which he informs me of a very similar hyperbole extant in a MS commentary upon Plato's Phaedon written by Hermias a christian philosopher of the second century and which is printed in Bayle's Dictionary Art Achilles It contains the following anecdote of Homer  That keeping some sheep near the tomb of Achilles he obtained by his offerings and supplications a sight of that hero who appeared to him surrounded with so much glory that Homer could not bear the splendor of it and that he was not only dazzled but blinded by the sight  The ingenious gentleman makes no doubt but Mr Gray took his thought from this passage and applauds him for the manner in which he has improved upon it he also thinks in general  that a deviation from historical truth though it may cast a shade over the middling beauties of poetry produces no bad effect where the magnificence and brilliancy of the images entirely fill the imagination  and with regard to this passage in prticular he intimates  that as the cause of Milton's blindness is not so well known as the thing itself the licence of poetical invention may allow him to assign a cause different from the real fact  However this may be the very exact resemblance which the two thoughts bear to one another will I hope vindicate Mr Gray's from being a modern concetto in the taste of the Italian school as it has been deemed to be by some critics But this resemblance will do more and it is on this account chiefly that I produce and thank the gentleman for communicating it it will prove the extreme uncertainty of dec  ding upon poetical imitations for I am fully persuaded that Mr Gray had never seen or at least attended to this Greek fragment How scrupul  us he was in borrowing even an epithet from another poet many of his notes on this very ode fully prove And as to the passage in question he would certainly have cited it for the sake of vindicating his own taste by classical authority especially when the thought had been so much controverted  Closed his eyes in endless night  Behold where Dryden's less presumptuous car  Wide o'er the fields of glory bear  Two coursers of etherial race  IMITATION  Ha thou cloathed his neck with thunder  Job  This verse and the foreg  ng are meant to express the stately march and sounding energy of Dryden's rhymes G  With neck  in thunder cloath'd and longresounding pace  III  Hark his hands the lyre explore  Brighteyed Fancy hovering o'er  Scatters from her pictur'd urn  IMITATION  Words that weep and tears that speak  Cowley  Thoughts that breathe and words that burn  We have had in our language no other odes of the sublime kind than that of Dryden on St Cecilia's Day for Cowley who had his merit yet wanted judgment style and harmony for such a task That of Pope is not worthy of so great a man Mr Mason indeed of late days has touched the true chords and with a masterly hand in some of his chorusesabove all in the last of Caractacus  Hark heard ye not yon footstep dread G  But ah 'tis heard no more  Oh Lyre divine what daring Spirit  Wakes thee now though he inherit  Nor the pride nor ample pinion    Olymp  ii  Pindar compares himself to that bird and his enemies to ravers that croak and clamour in vain while it pursues its flight regardless of their noise G  That the Theban Eagle bear  Sailing with supreme dominion  Through the azure deep of air  Yet oft before his infant eyes would run  Such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray  With orient hues unborrow'd of the Sun  Yet shall he mount and keep his distant way  Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate  Beneath the Good how farbut far above the Great  ODE  BY THE SAME  The following Ode is founded on a tradition current in Wales that  EDWARD  the First when he compleated the conquest of that country ordered all the Bards that fell into his hands to be put to death  I  '  On this noble exordium the anonymous critic beforementioned thus eloquently expresses his admiration  This abrupt execration plunges the reader into that sudden fearful perplexity which is designed to predominate through the whole The irresistible violence of the prophet's passions bears him away who as he is unprepared by a formal ushering in of the speaker is unfortified against the impressions of his poetical phrenzy and overpowered by them as sudden thunders strike the deepest  All readers of taste I fancy have felt this effect from the passage they will be well pleased however to see their own feelings so well expressed as they are in this note  RUIN seize thee ruthless King  'Confusion on thy banners wait  'Though fann'd by Conquest's crimson wing  '  IMITATION  Mocking the air with colours idly spread  Shakspeare's King John  They mock the air with idle state  'Helm nor Hauberk's  The hauberk was a texture of steel ringlets or rings interwoven forming a coat of mail that sate close to the body and adapted itself to every motion G  twisted mail  'Nor even thy virtues Tyrant shall avail  'To save thy secret soul from nightly fears  'From Cambria's curse from Cambria's tears'  IMITATION  The crested adder's pride  Dryden's Indian Queen  Such were the sounds that o'er the crested pride  Of the first Edward scatter'd wild dismay  As down the steep of Snowdon's  Snowdon was a name given to that mountainous tract which the Welch themselves call  Craigiancryri  it included all the highlands of Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire as far east as the river Conway R Hygden speaking of the Castle of Conway built by king Edward the first says "Ad ortum amnis Conway ad clivum montis Erery" and Matthew of Westminster ad ann  Apud Aberconway ad pedes montis Snowdoniae fecit erigi castrum forte  G  shaggy side  He wound with toilsome march his long array  Stout Gloster  Gilbert de Clare surnamed the Red Earl of Gloucester and Hertford soninlaw to King Edward G  stood aghast in speechless trance  To arms cried Mortimer  Edmond de Mortimer Lord of Wigmore  They both were Lords Marchers whose lands lay on the borders of Wales and probably accompanied the king in this expedition G  and couch'd his quiv'ring lance  I  On a rock whose haughty brow  Frowns o'er old Conway's foaming flood  Robed in the sable garb of woe  With haggard eyes the Poet stood  The image was taken from a wellknown picture of Raphael representing the Supreme Being in the vision of Ezekiel there are two of these paintings both believed to be originals one at Florence the other in the Duke of Orlean's collection at Paris G  Mr Gray never saw the large Cartoon done by the same divine hand in the possession of the Duke of Montagu at his seat at Boughton in Northamptonshire else I am persuaded he would have mentioned it in his note The two finished pictures abroad which I believe are closetpieces can hardly have so much spirit in them as this wonderful drawing it gave me the sublimest idea I ever received from painting Moses breaking the tables of the law by Parmegiano was a figure which Mr Gray used to say came still nearer to his meaning than the picture of Raphael M  Loose his beard and hoary hair  Stream'd like a meteor to the troubled air  And with a Master's hand and Prophet's fire  Struck the deep sorrows of his lyre  'Hark how each giantoak and desart cave  'Sighs to the torrent's aweful voice beneath  'O'er thee oh King their hundred arms they wave  'Revenge on thee in hoarser numbers breathe  'Vocal no more since Cambria's fatal day  'To highborn Hoel's harp or soft Llewellyn's lay  I  'Cold is Cadwallo's tongue  'That hush'd the stormy main  'Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed  'Mountains ye mourn in vain  'Modred whose magic song  'Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloudtopp'd head  '  The shores of Caernarvonshire opposite to the Isle of Anglesey G  On dreary Arvon's coast they lie  'Smear'd with gore and ghastly pale  'Far for aloof th' affrighted ravens sail  '  Camden and others observe that eagles used annually to build their aerie among the rocks of Snowdon which have from thence as some think been named by the Welch  Craigiancryri  or the crags of the eagles At this day I am told the highest point of Snowdon is called  the eagle's nest  That bird is certainly no stranger to this island as the Scots and the people of Cumberland Westmoreland c can testify it even has built its nest in the Peak of Derbyshire See Willoughby's Ornithol published by Ray G  The famish'd Eagle screams and passes by  'Dear lost companions of my tuneful art  '  IMITATION  As dear to me as the ruddy drops  That visit my sad heart  Shaksp Julius Caesar  G  Dear as the light that visits these sad eyes  'Dear as the ruddy drops that warm my heart  'Ye died amidst your dying country's cries  '  Here says the anonymous Critic a vision of triumphant revenge is judiciously made to ensue after the pathetic lamentation which precedes it Breaksdouble rhymesan appropriated cadence and an exalted ferocity of language forcibly picture to us the uncontroulable tumultuous workings of the prophet's stimulated bosom M  No more I weep They do not sleep  'On yonder cliffs a griesly band  'I see them sit they linger yet  'Avengers of their native land  'With me in dreadful harmony they join  'And weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line  II  "  Can there be an image more just apposite and nobly imagined than this tremendous tragical windingsheet In the rest of this stanza the wildness of thought expression and cadence are admirably adapted to the character and situation of the speaker and of the bloody spectres his assistants It is not indeed peculiar to it alone but a beauty that runs throughout the whole composition that the historical events are briefly sketched out by a few striking circumstances in which the poet's office of rather exciting and directing than satisfying the reader's imagination is perfectly observed Such abrupt hints resembling the several fragments of a vast ruin suffer not the mind to be raised to the utmost pitch by one image of horror but that instantaneously a second and a third are presented to it and the affection is still uniformly supported  Anon Critic  M  Weave the warp and weave the woof  "The windingsheet of Edward's race  "Give

sable Warriour fled  "Thy son is gone He rests among the Dead  "The swarm that in thy noontide beam were born  "Gone to salute the rising Morn  "  Magnificence of Richard the Second's reign See Froissart and other contemporary writers It is always entertaining and sometimes useful to be informed how a writer frequently improves on his original thoughts on this account I have occasionally set down the few variations which Mr Gray made in his lyrical composition The six lines before us convey perhaps the most beautiful piece of imagery in the whole Ode and were a wonderful improvement on those which he first wrote which though they would appear fine in an inferior poet are infinitely below those which supplanted them I find them in one of his corrected manuscripts as follow VARIATION  Mirrors of Saxon truth and loyalty  Your helpless old expiring Master view  They hear not scarce Religion dares supply  Her mutter'd Requiems and her holy dew  Yet thou proud boy from Pomfret's walls

"Youth on the prow and Pleasure at the helm  "Regardless of the sweeping Whirlwind's sway  "That hush'd in trim repose expects his eveningprey  II  "  Richard the Second as we are told by Archbishop Scroop Thomas of Walsingham and all the older Writers was starved to death The story of his assassination by Sir Piers of Exon is of much later date G  This stanza as an ingenious friend remarks has exceeding merit It breathes in a lesser compass what the Ode breathes at large the high spirit of lyric Enthusiasm The Transitions are sudden and imperuous the language full of fire and force and the Imagery carried without impropriety to the most daring height The manner of Richard's death by famine exhibits such beauties of Personification as only the richest and most vivid imagination could supply From thence we are hurried with the wildest rapidity into the midst of battle and the epithet  kindred  places at once before our eyes all the peculiar horrors of civil war Immediately by a transition most striking and unexpected the Poet falls into a tender and pathetic address which from the sentiments and also from the numbers has all the melancholy flow and breathes all the plaintive softness of Elegy Again the Scene changes again the Bard rises into an allegorical description of Carnage to which the metre is admirably adapted and the concluding sentence of personal punishment on Edward is denounced with a solemnity that chills and terrifies M  Fill high the sparkling bowl  "The rich repast prepare  "Reft of a crown he yet may share the feast  "Close by the regal chair  "Fell Thirst and Famine scowl  "A baleful smile upon their baffled Guest  "  Ruinous civil wars of York and Lancaster M  Hear ye the din of battle bray  "Lance to lance and horse to horse  "Long years of havoc urge their destin'd course  "And through the kindred squadrons mow their way  "  Henry the VI George Duke of Clarence Edward the Fifth Richard Duke of York c believed to be murdered secretly in

POSTSCRIPT  HAVING now by the advice and assistance of my friends brought this Collection of POEMS to a competent size it has been thought proper that the farther progress of its growth should here be stopp'd From the loose and fugitive pieces some printed others in manuscript which for forty or fifty years past have been thrown into the world and carelessly left to perish I have here according to the most judicious opinions I could obtain in distinguishing their merits endeavour'd to select and preserve the best The favourable reception which the former volumes have met with demands my warmest acknowledgments and calls for all my care in compleating the Collection and in this respect if it appear that I have not been altogether negligent I shall hope to be allowed the merit which is all I claim of having furnished to the Public an elegant and polite Amusement Little more need be added than to return my thanks to several ingenious friends who have obligingly contributed to this Entertainment If the reader should happen to find what I hope he seldom will any pieces which he may think unworthy of having been inserte as it would ill become me to attribute his dislike of them to his own want of Taste so I am too conscious of my own deficiencies not to allow him to impute the insertion of them to mine  R DODSLEY  INDEX TO THE SIXTH VOLUME  HYMN to the Naiads  Page  Ode to the
