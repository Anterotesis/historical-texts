CHURCHYARD MDCCXCI  ADVERTISEMENT  THE general design of the following sheets is to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science and to lead her votaries from the looser analogies which dress out the imagery of poetry to the stricter ones which form the ratiocination of philosophy While their particular design is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of Botany by introducing them to the vestibule of that delightful science and recommending to their attention the immortal works of the celebrated Swedish Naturalist LINNEUS  In the first Poem or Economy of Vegetation the physiology of Plants is delivered and the operation of the Elements as far as they may be supposed to affect the growth of Vegetables In the second Poem or Loves of the Plants the Sexual System of Linneus is explained with the remarkable properties of many particular plants  APOLOGY  IT may be proper here to apologize for many of the subsequent conjectures on some articles of natural philosophy as not being supported by accurate investigation or conclusive experiments Extravagant theories however in those parts of philosophy where our knowledge is yet imperfect are not without their use as they encourage the execution of laborious experiments or the investigation of ingenious deductions to confirm or refute them And since natural objects are allied to each other by many affinities every kind of theoretic distribution of them adds to our knowledge by developing some of their analogies  The Rosicrucian doctrine of Gnomes Sylphs Nymphs and Salamanders was thought to afford a proper machinery for a Botanic poem as it is probable that they were originally the names of hieroglyphic figures representing the elements  Many of the important operations of Nature were shadowed or allegorized in the heathen mythology as the first Cupid springing from the Egg of Night the marriage of Cupid and Psyche the Rape of Proserpine the Congress of Jupiter and Juno Death and Resuscitation of Adonis c many of which are ingeniously explained in the works of Bacon Vol V p th Edit London The  Egyptians were possessed of many discoveries in philosophy and chemistry before the invention of letters these were then expressed in hieroglyphic paintings of men and animals which after the discovery of the alphabet were described and animated by the poets and became first the deities of Egypt and afterwards of Greece and Rome Allusions to those fables were therefore thought proper ornaments to a philosophical poem and are occasionally introduced either as represented by the poets or preserved on the numerous gems and medallions of antiquity  TO THE AUTHOR OF THE POEM ON THE LOVES OF THE PLANTS  BY THE REV W B STEPHENS  OFT tho' thy genius D amply fraught  With native wealth

shell  "And if with Thee some hapless Maid should stray  Disasterous Love companion of her way  Disasterous Love  l The scenery is taken from a botanic garden about a mile from Lichfield where a cold bath was erected by Sir John Floyer There is a grotto surrounded by projecting rocks from the edges of which trickles a perpetual shower of water and it is here represented as adapted to lovescenes as being thence a proper residence for the modern goddess of Botany and the easier to introduce the next poem on the Loves of the Plants according to the system of Linneus  Oh lead her timid steps to yonder glade  Whose arching cliffs depending alders shade  There as meek Evening wakes her temperate breeze  And moonbeams glimmer through the trembling trees  The rills that gurgle round shall soothe her ear  The weeping rocks shall number tear for tear  There as sad Philomel alike forlorn  Sings to the Night from her accustomed thorn  While at sweet intervals each falling note  Sighs in the gale and whispers round the grot  The sisterwoe shall calm her aching breast  And softer slumbers steal her cares to rest  "Winds of the North restrain your icy gales  Nor chill the bosom of these happy

hours on purple pinions move  And arms her Zephyrs with the shafts of Love  Pleased GNOMES ascending from their earthy beds  Pleased Gnomes  l The Rosicrucian doctrine of Gnomes Sylphs Nymphs and Salamanders affords proper machinery for a philosophic poem as it is probable that they were originally the names of hieroglyphic figures of the Elements or of Genii presiding over their operations The Faries of more modern days seem to have been derived from them and to have inherited their powers The Gnomes and Sylphs as being more nearly allied to modern Fairies are represented as either male or female which distinguishes the latter from the Aurae of the Latin Poets which were only female except the winds as Zephyrus and Auster may be supposed to have been their husbands  Play round her graceful footsteps as she treads  Gay SYLPHS attendant beat the fragrant air  On winnowing wings and waft her golden hair  Blue NYMPHS emerging leave their sparkling streams  And FIERY FORMS alight

From each bright gem of Day's refulgent car  From the pale sphere of every twinkling star  From each nice pore of ocean earth and air  With eye of flame the sparkling hosts repair  Mix their gay hues in changeful circles play  Like motes that tenant the meridian ray  So the clear Lens collects with magic power  The countless glories of the midnight hour  Stars after stars with quivering lustre fall  And twinkling glide along the whiten'd wall  Pleased as they pass she counts the glittering bands  And stills their murmur with her waving hands  Each listening tribe with fond expectance burns  And now to these and now to those she turns  I "NYMPHS OF PRIMEVAL FIRE YOUR vestal train  Nymphs of primeval fire  l The fluid matter of heat is perhaps the most extensive element in nature all other bodies are immersed in it and are preserved in their present state of solidity or fluidity by the attraction of their particles to the matter of heat Since all known bodies are contractible into less space by depriving them of some portion of their heat and as there is no part of nature totally deprived of heat there is reason to believe that the particles of bodies do not touch but are held towards each other by their selfattraction and recede from each other by their attraction to the mass of heat which surrounds them and thus exist in an equilibrium between these two powers If more of the matter of heat be applied to them they recede further from each other and become fluid if still more be applied they take an aerial form and are termed Gasses by the modern chemists Thus when water is heated to a certain degree it would instantly assume the form of steam but for the pressure of the atmosphere which prevents this change from taking place so easily the same is true of quicksilver diamonds and of perhaps all other bodies in Nature they would first become fluid and then aeriform by appropriated degrees of heat On the contrary this elastic matter of heat termed Calorique in the new nomenclature of the French Academicians is liable to become consolidated itself in its combinations with some bodies as perhaps in nitre and probably in combustible bodies as sulphur and charcoal See note on l of this Canto Modern philosophers have not yet been able to decide whether light and heat be different fluids or modifications of the same fluid as they have many properties in common See note on l of this Canto  Hung with goldtresses o'er the vast inane  Pierced with your silver shafts the throne of Night  And charm'd young Nature's opening eyes with light  When LOVE DIVINE with brooding wings unfurl'd  When Love Divine  l From having observed the gradual evolution of the young animal or plant from its egg or seed and afterwards its successive advances to its more perfect state or maturity philosophers of all ages seem to have imagined that the great world itself had likewise its infancy and its gradual progress to maturity this seems to have given origin to the very antient and sublime allegory of Eros or Divine Love producing the world from the egg of Night as it floated in Chaos See l of this Canto  The external crust of the earth as far as it has been exposed to our view in mines or mountains countenances this opinion since these have evidently for the most part had their origin from the shells of fishes the decomposition of vegetables and the recrements of other animal materials and must therefore have been formed progressively from small beginnings There are likewise some apparently useless or incomplete appendages to plants and animals which seem to shew they have gradually undergone changes from their original state such as the stamens without anthers and styles without stigmas of several plants as mentioned in the note on Curcuma Vol II of this work Such as the halteres or rudiments of wings of some twowinged insects and the paps of male animals thus swine have four toes but two of them are imperfectly formed and not long enough for use The allantoide in some animals seems to have become extinct in others is above tenfold the size which would seem necessary for its purpose Buffon du Cochon T p Perhaps all the supposed monstrous births of Nature are remains of their habits of production in their former less perfect state or attempts towards greater perfection  Call'd from the rude abyss the living world  "LET THERE BE LIGHT" proclaim'd the ALMIGHTY LORD  Astonish'd Chaos heard the potent word  Through all his realms the kindling Ether runs  Through all his realms  l Mr Herschel has given a very sublime and curious account of the construction of the heavens with his discovery of some thousand nebulae or clouds of stars many of which are much larger collections of stars than all those put together which are visible to our naked eyes added to those which form the galaxy or milky zone which surrounds us He observes that in the vicinity of these clusters of stars there are proportionally fewer stars than in other parts of the heavens and hence he concludes that they have attracted each other on the supposition that infinite space was at first equally sprinkled with them as if it had at the beginning been filled with a fluid mass which had coagulated Mr Herschel has further shewn that the whole sidereal system is gradually moving round some centre which may be an opake mass of matter Philos Trans V LXXIV If all these Suns are moving round some great central body they must have had a projectile force as well as a centripetal one and may thence be supposed to have emerged or been projected from the material where they were produced We can have no idea of a natural power which could project a Sun out of Chaos except by comparing it to the explosions or earthquakes owing to the sudden evolution of aqueous or of other more elastic vapours of the power of which under immeasurable degrees of heat and compression we are yet ignorant  It may be objected that if the stars had been projected from a Chaos by explosions that they must have returned again into it from the known laws of gravitation this however would not happen if the whole of Chaos like grains of gunpowder was exploded at the same time and dispersed through infinite space at once or in quick succession in every possible direction The same objection may be stated against the possibility of the planets having been thrown from the fun by explosions and the secondary planets from the primary ones which will be spoken of more at large in the second Canto but if the planets are supposed to have been projected from their suns and the secondary from the primary ones at the beginning of their course they might be so influenced or diverted by the attractions of the suns or sun in their vicinity as to prevent their tendency to return into the body from which they were projected  Is these innumerable and immense suns thus rising out of Chaos are supposed to have thrown out their attendant planets by new explosions as they ascended and those their respective satellites filling in a moment the immensity of space with light and motion a grander idea cannot be conceived by the mind of man  And the mass starts into a million suns  Earths round each sun with quick explosions burst  And second planets issue from the first  Bend as they journey with projectile force  In bright ellipses their reluctant

lighter gases circumfused on high  Where lighter gases  l Mr Cavendish has shewn that the gas called inflammable air is at least ten times lighter than common air Mr Lavoisier contends that it is one of the component parts of water and is by him called hydrogene It is supposed to afford their principal nourishment to vegetables and thence to animals and is perpetually rising from their decomposition this source of it in hot climates and in summer months is so great as to exceed estimation Now if this light gas passes through the atmosphere without combining with it it must compose another atmosphere over the aerial one which must expand when the pressure above it is thus taken away to inconceivable tenuity  If this supernatural gasseous atmosphere floats upon the aerial one like ether upon water what must happen l it will flow from the line where it will be produced in the greatest quantities and become much accumulated over the poles of the earth the common air or lower stratum of the atmosphere will be much thinner over the poles than at the line because if a glass globe be filled with oil and water and whirled upon its axis the centrifugal power will carry the heavier fluid to the circumference and the lighter will in consequence be found round the axis There may be a place at some certain latitude between the poles and the line on each side the equator where the inflammable supernatant atmosphere may end owing to the greater centrifugal force of the heavier aerial atmosphere Between the termination of the aerial and the beginning of the gasseous atmosphere the airs will occasionally be intermixed and thus become inflammable by the electric spark these circumstances will assist in explaining the phenomena of fireballs northern lights and of some variable winds and long continued rains  Since the above note was first written Mr Volta I am informed has applied the supposition of a supernatant atmosphere of inflammable air to explain some phenomena in meteorology And Mr Lavoisier has announced his design to write on this subject Traitè de Chimie Tom I I am happy to find these opinions supported by such respectable authority  Form the vast concave of exterior sky  With airy lens the scatter'd rays assault  And bend the twilight round the dusky vault  And bend the twilight  l The crepuscular atmosphere or the region where the light of the sun ceases to be refracted to us is estimated by philosophers to be between and miles high at which time the sun is about degrees below the horizon and the rarity of the air is supposed to be from to times greater than at the surface of the earth Cotes's Hydrost p The duration of twilight differs in different seasons and in different latitudes in England the shortest twilight is about the beginning of October and of March in more northern latitudes where the sun never finks more than degrees below the horizon the twilight continues the whole night The time of its duration may also be occasionally affected by the varying height of the atmosphere A number of observations on the duration of twilight in different latitudes might afford considerable information concerning the aerial strata in the higher regions of the atmosphere and might assist in determining whether an exterior atmosphere of inflammable gas or Hydrogene exists over the aerial one  Ride with broad eye and

innocuous embers to the night  Hurl innocuous embers  l The immediate cause of volcanic eruptions is believed to be owing to the water of the sea or from lakes or inundations finding itself a passage into the subterraneous fires which may lie at great depths This must first produce by its coldness a condensation of the vapour there existing or a vacuum and thus occasion parts of the earth's crust or shell to be forced down by the pressure of the incumbent atmosphere Afterwards the water being suddenly raised into steam produces all the explosive effects of earthquakes And by new accessions of water during the intervals of the explosions the repetition of the shocks is caused These circumstances were hourly illustrated by the fountains of boiling water in Iceland in which the surface of the water in the boiling wells sunk down low before every new ebullition  Besides these eruptions occasioned by the steam of water there seems to be a perpetual effusion of other vapours more noxious and as far as it is yet known perhaps greatly more expansile than water from the Volcanos in various parts of the world As these Volcanos are supposed to be spiracula or breathing holes to the great subterraneous fires it is probable that the escape of elastic vapours from them is the cause that the earthquakes of modern days are of such small extent compared to those of antient times of which vestiges remain in every part of the world and on this account may be said not only to be innocuous but useful  While with loud shouts to Etna Heccla calls  And Andes answers from his beacon'd walls

 IV" EFFULGENT MAIDS YOU round deciduous day  Tressed with soft beams your glittering bands array  Confine with folds of air  l The air like all other bad conductors of electricity is known to be a bad conductor of heat and thence prevents the heat acquired from the sun's rays by the earth's surface from being so soon dissipated in the same manner as a blanket which may be considered as a sponge filled with air prevents the escape of heat from the person wrapped in it This seems to be one cause of the great degree of cold on the tops of mountains where the rarity of the air is greater and it therefore becomes a better conductor both of heat and electricity See note on Barometz Vol II of this work  There is however another cause to which the great coldness of mountains and of the higher regions of the atmosphere is more immediately to be ascribed explained by Dr Darwin in the Philos Trans Vol LXXVIII who has there proved by experiments with the airgun and airpump that when any portion of the atmosphere becomes mechanically expanded it absorbs heat from the bodies in its vicinity And as the air which creeps along the plains expands itself by a part of the pressure being taken off when it ascends the sides of mountains it at the same time attracts heat from the summits of those mountains or other bodies which happen to be immersed in it and thus produces cold Hence he concludes that the hot air at the bottom of the Andes becomes temperate by its own rarefaction when it ascents to the city of Quito and by its further rarefaction becomes cooled to the freezing point when it ascends to the snowy regions on the summits of those mountains To this also he attributes the great degree of cold experienced by the aeronauts in their balloons and which produces hail in summer at the height of only two or three miles in the atmosphere  On Earth's cold bosom as the Sun retires  Confine with folds of air the lingering fires  O'er Eve's pale forms diffuse phosphoric light  Diffuse phosphoric light  l I have often been induced to believe from observation that the twilight of the evenings is lighter than that of the mornings at the same distance from noon Some may ascribe this to the greater height of the atmosphere in the evenings having been rarefied by the sun during the day but as its density must at the same time be diminished its power of refraction would continue the same I should rather suppose that it may be owing to the phosphorescent quality as it is called of almost all bodies that is when they have been exposed to the sun they continue to emit light for a considerable time afterwards This is generally believed to arise either from such bodies giving out the light which they had previously absorbed or to the continuance of a slow combustion which the light they had been previously exposed to had excited See the next note  And deck with lambent flames the shrine of Night  So warm'd and kindled by meridian skies  And view'd in darkness with dilated eyes  BOLOGNA's chalks with saint ignition blaze  BECCARI's shells emit prismatic rays  Beccari's shells l  Beccari made made many curious experiments on the phosphoric light as it is called which becomes visible on bodies brought into a dark room after having been previously exposed to the sunshine It appears from these experiments that almost all inflammable bodies possess this quality in a greater or less degree white paper or linen thus examined after having been exposed to the sunshine is luminous to an extraordinary degree and if a person shut up in a dark room puts one of his hands out into the sun's light for a short time and then retracts it he will be able to see that hand distinctly and not the other These experiments seem to countenance the idea of light being absorbed and again emitted from bodies when they are removed into darkness But Beccari further pretended that some calcareous compositions when exposed to red yellow or blue light through coloured glasses would on their being brought into a dark room emit coloured lights This mistaken fact of Beccari's Mr Wilson decidedly refutes and among many other curious experiments discovered that if oystershells were thrown into a common fire and calcined for about half an hour and then brought to a person who had previously been some minutes in a dark room that many of them would exhibit beautiful irises of prismatic colours from whence probably arose Beccari's mistake Mr Wilson from hence contends that these kinds of phosphori do not emit the light they had previously received but that they are set on fire by the sun's rays and continue for some time a slow combustion after they are withdrawn from the light Wilson's Experiments on Phosphori Dodsley  The Bolognian stone is a selenite or gypsum and has been long celebrated for its phosphorescent quality after having been burnt in a sulphurous fire and exposed when cold to the sun's light It may be thus well imitated Calcine oystershells half an hour pulverize them when cold and add one third part of flowers of sulphur press them close into a small crucible and calcine them for an hour or longer and keep the powder in a phial close stopped A part of this powder is to be exposed for a minute or two to the sunbeams and then brought into a dark room The calcined Bolognian stone becomes a calcareous hepar of sulphur but the calcined shells as they contain the animal acid may also contain some of the phosphorus of Kunkel  So to the sacred Sun in MEMNON'S fane  In Memnon's fane  l See additional notes No

South America those which were brought over to England about eight years ago were about three or four feet long and gave an electric shock as I experienced by putting one finger on the back near its head and another of the opposite hand into the water near its tail In their native country they are said to exceed twenty feet in length and kill any man who approaches them in an hostile manner It is not only to escape its enemies that this surprizing power of the fish is used but also to take its prey which it does by benumbing them and then devouring them before they have time to recover or by perfectly killing them for the quantity of the power seemed to be determined by the will or anger of the animal as it sometimes struck a fish twice before it was sufficiently benumbed to be easily swallowed  The organs productive of this wonderful accumulation of electric matter have been accurately dissected and described by Mr J Hunter Philos Trans Vol LXV And are so divided by membranes as to compose a very extensive surface and are supplied with many pairs of nerves larger than any other nerves of the body but how so large a quantity is so quickly accumulated as to produce such amazing effects in a fluid ill adapted for the purpose is not yet satisfactorily explained The Torpedo possesses a similar power in a less degree as was shewn by Mr Walch and another fish lately described by Mr Paterson Philo Trans Vol LXXVI  In the construction of the LeydenPhial as it is called which is coated on both sides it is known that above one hundred times the quantity of positive electricity can be condensed on every square inch of the coating on one side than could have been accumulated on the same surface if there had been no opposite coating communicating with the earth because the negative electricity or that part of it which caused its expansion is now drawn off through the glass It is also well known that the thinner the glass is which is thus coated on both sides so as to make a Leydenphial or plate the more electricity can be condensed on one of its surfaces till it becomes so thin as to break and thence discharge itself  Now it is possible that the quantity of electricity condensible on one side of a coated phial may increase in some high ratio in respect to the thinness of the glass since the power of attraction is known to decrease as the squares of the distances to which this circumstance of electricity seems to bear some analogy Hence if an animal membrane as thin as the silkworm spins its silk could be so situated as to be charged like the Leyden bottle without bursting as such thin glass would be liable to do it would be difficult to calculate the immense quantity of electric fluid which might be accumulated on its surface No land animals are yet discovered which possess this power though the air would have been a much better medium for producing its effects perhaps the size of the necessary apparatus would have been inconvenient to land

The first and most important discovery of mankind seems to have been that of fire For many ages it is probable fire was esteemed a dangerous enemy known only by its dreadful devastations and that many lives must have been lost and many dangerous burns and wounds must have afflicted those who first dared to subject it to the uses of life It is said that the tall monkies of Borneo and Sumatra lie down with pleasure ruond any accidental fire in their woods and are arrived to that degree of reason that knowledge of causation that they thrust into the remaining fire the halfburnt ends of the branches to prevent its going out One of the nobles of the cultivated people of Otaheita when Captain Cook treated them with tea catched the boiling water in his hand from the cock of the teaurn and

Chemist's hand  On tepid clouds of rising steam aspire  Or fix in sulphur all it's solid fire  Or fix in sulphur  l The phenomena of chemical explosions cannot be accounted for without the supposition that some of the bodies employed contain concentrated or solid heat combined with them to which the French Chemists have given the name of Calorique When air is expanded in the airpump or water evaporated into steam they drink up or absorb a great quantity of heat from this analogy when gunpowder is exploded it ought to absorb much heat that is in popular language it ought to produce a great quantity of cold When vital air is united with phlogistic matter in respiration which seems to be a slow combustion its volume is lessened the carbonic acid and perhaps phosphoric acid are produced and heat is given out which according to the experiments of Dr Crawford would seem to be deposited from the vital air But as the vital air in nitrous acid is condensed from a light elastic gas to that of a heavy fluid it must possess less heat than before And hence a great part of the heat which is given out in firing gunpowder I should suppose must reside in the sulphur or charcoal  Mr Lavoisier has shewn that vital air or Oxygene looses less of its heat when it becomes one of the component parts of nitrous acid than in any other of its combinations and is hence capable of giving out a great quantity of heat in the explosion of gunpowder but as there seems to be great analogy between the matter of heat or Calorique and the electric matter and as the worst conductors of electricity are believed to contain the greatest quantity of that fluid there is reason to suspect that the worst conductors of heat may contain the most of that fluid as sulphur wax silk air glass See note on l of

they have the property of giving sparks of light but it it seems to be an internal light perhaps of electric origin very different from the ignited sparks which are struck from flint and steel The sparks produced by the collision of steel with flint appear to be globular particles of iron which have been fused and imperfectly scorified or vitrified They are kindled by the heat produced by the collision but their vivid light and their fusion and vitrification are the effects of a combustion continued in these particles during their passage through the air This opinion is confirmed by an experiment of Mr Hawksbee who found that these sparks could not be produced in the exhausted receiver See Keir's Chemical Dict art Iron and art Earth vitrifiable  By fierce collision from the flint

Gunpowder As Bacon does not claim this as his own invention it is thought by many to have been of much more antient discovery  The permanently elastic fluid generated in the firing of gunpowder is calculated by Mr Robins to be about if the bulk of the powder be I And that the heat generated at the time of the explosion occasions the rarefied air thus produced to occupy about times the space of the gunpowder This pressure may therefore be called equal to atmospheres or six tons upon a square inch As the suddenness of this explosion must contribute much to its power it would seem that the chamber of powder to produce its greatest effect should be lighted in the centre of it which I believe is not attended to in the manufacture of muskets or pistols  From the cheapness with which a very powerful gunpowder is likely soon to be manufactured from aerated marine acid or from a new method of forming nitrous acid by means of mangonese or other calciform ores it may probably in time be applied to move machinery and supersede the use of steam  There is a bitter invective in Don Quixot against the inventors of gunpowder as it levels the strong with the weak the knight cased in steel

air in consequence of the condensation of steam is properly ascribed to Capt Savery a plate and description of this machine is given in Harris's Lexicon Technicum art Engine Though the Marquis of Worcester in his Century of Inventions printed in the year had described an engine for raising water by the explosive power of steam long before Savery's Mr Desegulier affirms that Savery bought up all he could procure of the books of the Marquis of Worcester and destroyed them professing himself then to have discovered the power of steam by accident which seems to have been an unfounded slander Savery applied it to the raising of water to supply houses and gardens but could not accomplish the draining of mines by it Which was afterwards done by Mr Newcomen and Mr John Cowley at Dartmouth in the year who added the piston  A few years ago Mr Watt of Glasgow much improved this machine and with Mr Boulton of Birmingham has applied it to variety of purposes such as raising water from mines blowing bellows to fuse the ore supplying towns with water grinding corn and many other purposes There is reason to believe it may in time be applied to the rowing of barges and the moving of carriages along the road As the specific levity of air is too great for the support of great burthens by balloons there seems no probable method of flying conveniently but by the power of steam or

pamphlet on Divine Benevolence asserted printed for Davis Yet if we may compare the parts of nature with each other there are some circumstances of her economy which seem to contribute more to the general scale of happiness than others Thus the nourishment of animal bodies is derived from three sources the milk given from the mother to the offspring in this excellent contrivance the mother has pleasure in affording the sustenance to the child and the child has pleasure in receiving it Another source of the food of animals includes seeds or eggs in these the embryon is in a torpid or insensible state and there is along with it laid up for its early nourishment a store of provision as the fruit belonging to some seeds and the oil and starch belonging to others when these are consumed by animals the unfeeling seed or egg receives no pain but the animal receives pleasure which consumes it Under this article may be included the bodies of animals which die naturally But the last method of supporting animal bodies by the destruction of other living animals as lions preying upon lambs these upon living vegetables and mankind upon them all would appear to be a less perfect part of the economy of nature than those before mentioned as contributing less to the sum of general happiness  "Now his hard hands on Mona's rifted crest  Mona's rifted crest  Alluding to the very

great antiquity as appears from the simplicity of his dress and armour a lion's skin and a club and from the nature of many of his exploits the destruction of wild beasts and robbers This part of the history of Hercules seems to have related to times before the invention of the bow and arrow or of spinning flax Other stories of Hercules are perhaps of later date and appear to be allegorical as his conquering the rivergod Achilous and bringing Cerberus up to day light the former might refer to his turning the course of a river and draining a morass and the latter to his exposing a part of the superstition of the times The strangling the lion and tearing his jaws asunder are described from a statue in the Museum Florentinum and from an antique gem and the grasping Anteus to death in his arms as he lifts him from the earth is described from another antient cameo The famous pillars of Hercules have been variously explained Pliny asserts that the natives of Spain and of Africa believed that the mountains of Abyla and Calpè on each side of the straits of Gibraltar were the pillars of Hercules and that they were reared by the hands of that god and the sea admitted between them Plin

constantly operates so as to make the surface of the Mediterranean lower than that of the Atlantic it must have kept it very much lower before a passage for the water through the streights was opened It is probable before such an event took place the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean extended much further into that sea and were then for a great extent of country destroyed by the floods

means of the glassglobe and cushion is difficult to comprehend Dr Franklin's idea of the pores of the glass being opened by the friction and thence rendered capable of attracting more electric fluid which it again parts with as the pores contract again feems analogous in some measure to the heat produced by the vibration or condensation of bodies as when a nail is hammered or filed till it becomes hot as mentioned in additional Notes No VII Some philosophers have endeavoured to account for this phenomenon by supposing the existence of two electric fluids which may be called the vitreous

endeavoured to enlarge the sphere of pictorial language by putting a demon behind the pillow of a wicked man on his death bed Which unfortunately for the scientific part of painting the cold criticism of the present day has depreciated and thus barred perhaps the only road to the further improvement in this science  "You crowd in coated jars the denser fire  Pierce the thin glass and fuse the

fluid is so necessary to health that we become presently injured either by its access or defect and because almost every part of our bodies is supplied with branches from different pairs of nerves which would not seem necessary for their motion alone It is therefore probable that our sensation of electricity is only of its violence in passing through our system by its suddenly distending the muscles like any other mechanical violence and that it is general pain alone that we feel and not any sensation analogous to the specific quality of the object Nature may seem to have been niggardly to mankind in bestowing upon them so few senses since a sense to have perceived electricity and another to have perceived magnetism might have been of great service to them many ages before these

same time The temporary motion of a paralytic limb is likewise caused by passing the electric shock through it which would seem to indicate some analogy between the electric fluid and the nervous fluid which is seperated from the blood by the brain and and thence diffused along the nerves for the purposes of motion and sensation It probably destroys life by its sudden expansion of the nerves

rod into a glass bottle and preserving it from falling by means of silkstrings he found it electrified whenever a cloud passed over it receiving sparks by his finger from it and charging coated phials This great discovery taught us to defend houses and ships and temples from lightning and also to understand  that people are always perfectly safe in a room during a thunder storm if they keep themselves at three or four feet distance from the walls  for the matter of lightning in passing from the clouds to the earth or from the earth to the clouds runs through the walls of a house the trunk of a tree or other elevated object except there be some moister body as an animal in contact with them or nearly so and in that case the lightning leaves the wall or tree and passes through the

his danger by observing on a second watch the time which passes between the flash and the crack and reckoning a mile for every four seconds and a half and a little more For sound travels at the rate of feet in a second of time and the velocity of light through such small distances is not to be estimated In these circumstances a person will be safer by lying down on the ground than erect and still

YOUR VIRGIN TRAINS the transient HEAT dispart  Transient heat dispart  l Dr Crawford in his ingenious work on animal heat has endeavoured to prove that during the combination of the pure part of the atmosphere with the phlogistic part of the blood that much of the matter of the heat is given out from the air and that this is the great and perpetual source of the heat of animals to which we may add that the phosphoric acid is probably produced by this combination by which acid the colour of the blood is changed in the lungs from a deep crimson to a bright scarlet There seems to be however another source of animal heat though of a similar nature and that is from the chemical combinations produced in all the glands since by whatever cause any glandular secretion is increased as by friction or topical imflammation the heat of that part becomes increased at the same time thus after the hands have been for a time immersed in snow on coming into a warm room they become red and hot without any increased pulmonary action BESIDES THIS there would seem to be another material received from the air by respiration which is so necessary to life that the embryon must learn to breath almost within a minute after its birth or it dies The perpetual necessity of breathing shews that the material thus acquired is perpetually consuming or escaping and on that account requires perpetual

this country are accompanied or produced by a NE wind and the thaws by a S W wind the reason of which is that the NE winds consist of regions of air brought from the north which appear to acquire an easterly direction as they advance and the S W winds consist of regions of air brought from the south which appear to acquire a westerly direction as they advance The surface of the earth nearer the pole moves slower than it does in our latitude whence the regions of air brought from thence move slower when they arrive hither than the earth's surface with which they now become in contact that is they acquire an apparent easterly direction as the earth moves from west to east faster than this new part of its atmosphere The S W winds on the contrary consist of regions of air brought from the south where the surface of the earth moves faster than in our latitude and have therefore a westerly direction when they arrive hither by their moving faster than the surface of the earth with which they are in contact and in general the nearer to the west and the greater the velocity of these winds the warmer they should be in respect to the season of the year since they have been brought more expeditiously from the South than those winds which have less westerly direction and have thence been less cooled in their passage  Sometimes I have observed the thaw to commence immediately on the change of the wind even within an hour is I am not mistaken or sooner At other times the SW wind has continued a day or even two before the thaw has commenced during which time some of the frosty air which had gone southwards is driven back over us and in confequence has taken a westerly direction as well as a southern one At other times I have observed a frost with a NE wind every morning and a

water contained in the vessels of plants Water converted into ice occupies a greater space than it did before as appears by the bursting of bottles filled with water at the time of their freezing Hence frost destroys those plants of our island first which are most succulent and the most succulent parts first of other plants as their leaves and last year's shoots the vessels of which are distended and burst by the expansion of their freezing fluids while the drier or more resinous plants as pines yews laurels and other evergreens are less liable to injury from cold The trees in vallies are on this account more injured by the vernal frosts than those on eminencies because their early succulent shoots come out sooner Hence fruit trees covered by a sixinch coping of a wall are less injured by the vernal frosts because their being shielded from showers and the descending nightdews has prevented them from being moist at the time of their being frozen which circumstance has given occasion to a vulgar error amongst gardeners who suppose frost to descend  As the common heat of the earth in this climate is degrees those tender trees which will bear bending down are easily secured from the frost by spreading them upon the ground and covering them with straw or fern This particularly suits figtrees as they easily bear bending to the ground and are furnished with an acrid juice which secures them from the depredations of insects but are nevertheless liable to be eaten by mice See additional notes No XII  Break his white towers and pierce his crystal mail  To Zembla's

Where dwell my vegetative realms benumb'd  In buds imprison'd or in bulbs intomb'd  In buds imprison'd  l The buds and bulbs of plants constitute what is termed by Linneus the Hybernaculum or winter cradle of the embryon vegetable The buds arise from the bark on the branches of trees and the bulbs from the caudex of bulbousrooted plants or the part from which the fibres of the root are produced they are defended from too much moisture and from frosts and from the depredations of insects by various contrivances as by scales hairs resinous varnishes and by acrid rinds  The buds of trees are of two kinds either flowerbuds or leaf buds the former of these produce their seeds and die the latter produce other leaf buds or flower buds and die So that all the buds of trees may be considered as annual plants having their embryon produced during the preceeding summer The same seems to happen with respect to bulbs thus a tulip produces annually one flowerbearing bulb sometimes two and several leafbearing bulbs and then the old root perishes Next year the flowerbearing bulb produces seeds and other bulbs and perishes while the leafbearing bulb producing other bulbs only perishes likewise these circumstances establish a strict analogy between bulbs and buds See additional notes No XIV  Pervade PELLUCID FORMS their cold retreat  Ray from bright urns your viewless floods of  heat  Viewless floods of beat  l The fluid matter of heat or Calorique in which all bodies are immersed is as necessary to vegetable as to animal existence It is not yet determinable whether heat and light be different materials or modifications of the same materials as they have some properties in common They appear to be both of them equally necessary to vegetable health since without light green vegetables become first yellow that is they lose the blue colour which contributed to produce the green and afterwards they also lose the yellow and become white as is seen in cellery blanched or etiolated for the table by excluding the light from it  The upper surface of leaves which I suppose to be their organ of respiration seems to require light as well as air since plants which grow in windows on the inside of houses are equally sollicitous to turn the upper side of their leaves to the light Vegetables at the same time exsude or perspire a great quantity from their leaves as animals do from their lungs this perspirable matter as it rises from their fine vessels perhaps much finer than the pores of animal skins is divided into inconcievable tenuity and when acted upon by the Sun's light appears to be decomposed the hydrogene becomes a part of the vegetable composing oils or resins and the Oxygene combined with light or calorique ascends producing the pure part of the atmosphere or vital air Hence during the light of the day vegetables give up more pure air than their respiration injures but not so in the night even though equally exposed to warmth This single fact would seem to shew that light is essentially different from heat and it is perhaps by its combination with bodies that their combined or latent heat is set at liberty and becomes sensible See additional note XXXIV  From earth's deep wastes  electric  torrents pour  Electric torrents pour  l The influence of electricity in forwarding the germination of plants and their growth seems to be pretty well established though Mr Ingenhouz did not succeed in his experiments and thence doubts the success of those of others And though M Rouland from his new experiments believes that neither positive nor negative electricity increases vegetation both which philosophers had previously been supporters of the contrary doctrine for many other naturalists have since repeated their experiments relative to this object and their new results have confirmed their former ones Mr D'Ormoy and the two Roziers have found the same success in numerous experiments which they have made in the last two years and Mr Carmoy has shewn in a convincing manner that electricity accelerates germination  Mr D'Ormoy not only found various seeds to vegetate sooner and to grow taller which were put upon his insulated table and supplied with electricity but also that silkworms began to spin much sooner which were kept electrified than those of the same hatch which were kept in the same place and manner except that they were not electrified These experiments of M D'Ormoy are detailed at length in the Journal de Physique of Rozier Tom XXXV p  M Bartholon who had before written a tract on this subject and proposed ingenious methods for applying electricity to agriculture and gardening has also repeated a numerous set of experiments and shews both that natural electricity as well as the artificial increases the growth of plants and the germination of seeds and opposes Mr Ingenhouz by very numerous and conclusive facts Ib Tom XXXV p  Since by the late discoveries or opinions of the Chemists there is reason to believe that water is decomposed in the vessels of vegetables and that the Hydrogene or inflammable air of which it in part consists contributes to the nourishment of the plant and to the production of its oils rosins gums sugar c and lastly as electricity decomposes water into these two airs termed Oxygene and Hydrogene there is a powerful analogy to induce us to believe that it accelerates or

thousand sails  On icebuilt isles  l There are many reasons to believe from the accounts of travellers and navigators that the islands of ice in the higher northern latitudes as well as the Glaciers on the Alps continue perpetually to increase in bulk At certain times in the icemountains of Switzerland there happen cracks which have shewn the great thickness of the ice as some of these cracks have measured three or four hundred ells deep The great islands of ice in the northern seas near Hudson's bay have been observed to have been immersed above one hundred fathoms beneath the surface of the sea and to have risen a fifth or sixth part above the surface and to have measured between three and four miles in circumference Phil Trans No Sect  Dr Lister endeavoured to shew that the ice of seawater contains some salt and perhaps less air than common ice and that it is therefore much more difficult of solution whence he accounts for the perpetual and great increase of these floating islands of ice Philos Trans No  As by a famous experiment of Mr Boyles it appears that ice evaporates very fast in severe frosty weather when the wind blows upon it and as ice in a thawing state is known to contain six times more cold than water at the same degree of sensible coldness it is easy to understand that winds blowing over islands and continents of ice perhaps much below nothing on Farenheit's scale and coming from thence into our latitude must bring great degrees of cold along with them If we add to this the quantity of cold produced by the evaporation of the water as well as by the solution of the ice we cannot doubt but that the northern ice is the principle source of the coldness of our winters and that it is brought hither by the regions of air blowing from the north and which take an apparent easterly direction by their coming to a part of the surface of the earth which moves faster than the latitude they come from Hence the increase of the ice in the polar regions by increasing the cold of our climate adds at the same time to the bulk of the Glaciers of Italy and Switzerland  If the nations who inhabit this hemisphere of the globe instead of destroying their seamen and exhausting their wealth in unnecessary wars could be induced to unite their labours to navigate these immense masses of ice into the more southern oceans two great advantages would result to mankind the tropic countries would be much cooled by their solution and our winters in this latitude would be rendered much milder for perhaps a century or two till the masses of ice became again enormous  Mr Bradley  ribes the cold winds and wet weather which sometimes happen in May and June to the solution of iceislands accidentally floating from the north Treatise on Husbandry and Gardening Vol II p And adds that Mr Barham about the year in his voyage from Jamaica to England in the beginning of June met with iceislands coming from the north which were surrounded with so great a fog that the ship was in danger of striking upon them and that one of them measured sixty miles in length  We have lately experienced an instance of iceislands brought from the Southern polar regions on which the Guardian struck at the beginning of her passage from the Cape of Good Hope towards Botany Bay on December These islands were involved in mist were about one hundred and fifty fathoms long

appears from an experiment of Mr Bennet He put some live coals into an insulated funnel of metal and throwing on them a little water observed that the ascending steam was electrised plus and the water which descended through the funnel was electrised minus Hence it appears that though clouds by their change of form may sometimes become electrised minus yet they have in general an accumulation of electricity This accumulation of electric matter also evidently contributes to support the atmospheric vapour when it is condensed into the form of clouds because it is seen to descend rapidly after the flashes of lightning have diminished its quantity whence there is reason to conclude that very numerous metallic rods with fine points erected high in the air might induce it at any time to part with some of its water  If we may trust the theory of Mr Lavoisier concerning the composition and decomposition of water there would seem another source of thundershowers and that is that the two gasses termed oxygene gas or vital air and hydrogene gas or inflammable air may exist in the summer atmosphere in a state of mixture but not of combination and that the electric spark or flash of

Her hardening strata spread  l The granite or moorstone or porphory constitute the oldest part of the globe since the limestone shells coralloids ond other seaproductions rest upon them and upon these seaproductions are found clay iron coal salt and siliceous sand or gritstone Thus there seem to be three divisions of the globe distinctly marked the first I suppose to have been the original nucleus of the earth or lava projected from the sun over this lie the recrements of animal and vegetable matter produced in the ocean and over these the recrements of animal and vegetable matter produced upon the land Besides these there are bodies which owe their origin to a combination of those already mentioned as siliceous sand fluor alabaster which seem to have derived their acids originally from the vegetable kingdom and their earthy bases from seaproductions See additional notes No XVI on calcareous earth  Raised her Primeval Islands from his bed  Raised her primeval islands  l The nucleus of the earth still covered with water received perpetual increase by the immense quantities of shells and coralloids either annually produced and relinquished or left after the death of the animals These would gradually by their different degrees of cohesion be some of them more and others less removable by the influence of solar tides and gentle tropical breezes which then must have probably extended from one pole to the other for it is supposed the moon was not yet produced and that no storms or unequal winds had yet existence  Hence then the primeval islands had their gradual origin were raised but a few feet above the level of the sea and were not exposed to the great or sudden variations of heat and cold as is so well explained in Mr Whithurst's Theory of the Earth chap xvi Whence the paradise of the sacred writers and the golden age of the profane ones seems to have had a real existence As there can be no rainbow when the heavens are covered with clouds because the sunbeams are then precluded from falling upon the raindrops opposite to the eye of the spectator the rainbow is a mark of gentle or partial showers Mr Whitehurst has endeavoured to show that the primitive islands were only moistened by nocturnal dews and not by showers as occurs at this day to the Delta of Egypt and is thence of opinion that the rainbow had no existence till after the production of mountains and continents As the salt of the sea has been gradually accumulating being washed down into it from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies the sea must originally have been as fresh as river

it covered with sea when the first great fires began deep in the internal parts of it those parts would become much expanded this expansion would be gradually extended as the heat increased through the whole terraqueous globe of miles diameter the crust would thence in many places open into fissures which by admitting the sea to flow in upon the fire would produce not only a quantity of steam beyond calculation by its expansion but would also by its decomposition produce inflammable air and vital air in quantities beyond conception sufficient to effect those violent explosions the vestiges of which all over the world excite our admiration and our study the difficulty of understanding how subterraneous fires could exist without the presence of air has disappeared since Dr Priestley's discoveries of such great quantities of pure air which constitute all the acids and consequently exist in all saline bodies as seasalt nitre limestone and in all calciform ores as manganese calamy ochre and other mineral substances See an ingenious treatise by Mr Michel on earthquakes in the Philos Trans  In these first tremendous ignitions of the globe as the continents were heaved up the

earth or if its atmosphere was afterwards stolen from it by the earth's attraction the water on the moon would rise quickly into vapour and the cold produced by a certain quantity of this evaporation would congeal the remainder of it Hence it is not probable that the moon is at present inhabited but as it seems to have suffered and to continue to suffer much by volcanos a sufficient quantity of air may in process of time be generated to produce an atmosphere which may prevent its heat from so easily escaping and its water from so easily evaporating and thence become fit for the production of vegetables and animals  That the moon possesses little or no atmosphere is deduced from the undiminished lustre of the stars at the instant when they emerge from behind her disk That the ocean of the moon is frozen is confirmed from there being no appearance of lunar tides which if they existed would cover the part of her disk nearest the earth See note on Canto III  "GNOMES how you trembled with the dreadful force  When Earth recoiling stagger'd from her course  When earth recoiling  l On supposition that the moon was thrown from the earth by the explosion of water or the generation of other vapours of greater power the remaining part of the globe would recede from its orbit in one direction as the moon receded in another and that in proportion to the respective momentum of each and would afterwards revolve round their common centre of gravity  If the moon rose from any part of the earth except exactly at the line or poles the shock would tend to turn the axis of the earth out of its previous direction And as a mass of matter rising from deep parts of the globe would have previously acquired less diurnal velocity than the earth's surface from whence it rose it would receive during the time of its rising additional velocity from the earth's surface and would consequently so much retard the motion of the earth round its axis  When the earth thus receded the shock would overturn all its buildings and forests and the water would rush with inconceivable violence over its surface towards the new satellite frem two causes both by its not at first acquiring the velocity with which the earth receded and by the attraction of the new moon as it leaves the earth on these accounts at first there would be but one tide till the moon receded to a greater distance and the earth moving

brick cement or salt soon dissolve or moulder away Ibid Could the timbers over watermill wheels or cellars be thus preserved by occasionally soaking them with brine These immense masses of rocksalt seem to have been produced by the evaporation of seawater in the early periods of the world by subterranean fires Dr Hutton's Theory of the Earth See also Theorie des Sources Salees par Mr Struve Histoire de Sciences de Lausanne Tom II This idea of Dr Hutton's is confirmed by a fact mentioned in M Macquart's Essais sur Minerologie who found a great quantity of fossil shells principally bivalves and madrepores in the saltmines of Wialiczka near Cracow During the evaporation of the lakes of saltwater as in artificial saltworks the salt begins to crystallize near the edges where the water is shallowest forming hollow inverted pyramids which when they become of a certain size subside by their gravity if urged by a stronger fire the salt fuses or forms large cubes whence the salt shaped in hollow pyramids called flakesalt is better tasted and preserves flesh better than the basket or powder salt because it is made by less heat and thence contains more of the marine acid The seawater about our island contains from about one twentyeighth to one thirtieth part of seasalt and about one eightieth of magnesian salt See Brownrigg on Salt See note on Ocymum Vol II of this work

brooms from earths and stones and thence called sweepings of nitre It has lately been found in large quantities in a natural bason of calcareous earth at Molfetta in Italy both in thin strata between the calcareous beds and in efflorescences of various beautiful leafy and hairy forms An account of this nitrebed is given by Mr Zimmerman and abridged in Rozier's Journal de Physique Fevrier This acid appears to be produced in all situations where animal and vegetable matters are compleatly decomposed and which are exposed to the action of the air as on the walls of stables and slaughterhouses the crystals are prisms furrowed by longitudinal groves  Dr Priestley discovered that nitrous air or gas which he obtained by dissolving metals in nitrous acid would combine rapidly with vital air and produce with it a true nitrous acid forming red clouds during the combination the two airs occupy only the space before occupied by one of them and at the same time heat is given out from the new combination This dimunition of the bulk of a mixture of nitrous gas and vital air Dr Priestley ingeniously used as a test of the purity of the latter a discovery of the greatest importance in the analysis of airs  Mr Cavendish has since demonstrated that two parts of vital air or oxygene and one part of phlogistic air or azote being long exposed to electric shocks unite and produce nitrous acid Philos Trans Vols LXXV and LXXVIII  Azote is one of the most abundant elements in nature and combined with calorique or heat it forms azotic gas or phlogistic air and composes two thirds of the atmosphere and is one of the principal component parts of animal bodies and when united to vital air or oxygene produces the nitrous acid Mr Lavoisier found that parts by weight of azote and parts of oxygene produced parts of nitrous gas and by the further addition of parts of oxygene nitrous acid was produced Traité de Chimie When two airs become united so as to produce an unelastic liquid much

abodes  Hence dusky Iron  l The production of iron from the decomposition of vegetable bodies is perpetually presented to our view the waters oozing from all morasses are chalybeate and deposit their ochre on being exposed to the air the iron acquiring a calciform state from its union with oxygene or vital air Where thin morasses lie on beds of gravel the latter are generally stained by the filtration of some of the chalybeate water through them This formation of iron from vegetable recrements is further evinced by the fern leaves and other parts of vegetables so frequently found in the centre of the knobs or nodules of some ironores  In some of these nodules there is a nucleus of whiter ironearth surrounded by many concentric strata of darker and lighter ironearth alternately In one which now lies before me the nucleus is a prism of a triangular form with blunted angles and about half an inch high and an inch and half broad on every side of this are concentric strata of similar ironearth alternately browner and less brown each stratum is about a tenth of an inch in thickness and there are ten of them in number To what known cause can this exactly regular distribution of so many earthy strata of different colours surrounding the nucleus be ascribed I dont know that any mineralogists have attempted an explanation of this wonderful phenomenon I suspect it is owing to the polarity of the central nucleus If ironfilings be regularly laid on paper by means of a small sieve and a magnet be placed underneath the filings will dispose themselves in concentric curves with vacant intervals between them Now if these ironfilings are conceived to be suspended in a fluid whose specific gravity is similar to their own and a magnetic bar was introduced as an axis into this fluid it is easy to foresee that the iron filings would dispose themselves into concentric spheres with intervals of the circumnatant fluid between them exactly as is seen in these nodules of ironearth As all the lavas consist of one fourth of iron Kirvan's Mineral and almost all other known bodies whether of animal or vegetable origin possess more or less of this property may not the distribution of a great portion of the globe of the earth into strata of greater or less regularity be owing to the polarity of the whole  And ferny foliage nestles in the nodes  Till with wide lungs the panting bellows blow  And waked by fire the glittering torrents flow  Quick whirls the wheel the ponderous hammer falls  Loud anvils ring amid the trembling walls  Strokes follow strokes the sparkling ingot shines  Flows the red slag the lengthening bar refines  Cold waves immersed the glowing mass congeal  And turn to adamant the hissing Steel  And turn to adamant  The circumstances which render iron more valuable to mankind than any other metal are its property of being rendered hard to so great a degree and thus constituting such excellent tools It was the discovery of this property of iron Mr Locke thinks that gave such preeminence to the European world over the American one Its power of being welded that is when two pieces are made very hot and applied together by hammering they unite compleatly unless any scale of iron intervenes and to prevent this it is usual for smiths to dip the very hot bar in sand a little of which fuses into fluid glass with the scale and is squeezed out from between the uniting parts by the force of hammering Its power of acquiring magnetism  It is however to be wished that gold or silver were discovered in as great quantity as iron since these metals being indestructible by exposure to air water fire or any common acids would supply wholesome vessels for cookery so much to be desired and so difficult to obtain and would form the most light and durable coverings for houses as well as indestructible firegrates ovens and boiling vessels See additional notes No XVIII on Steel  "Last MICHELL's hands with touch of potent charm  Last Michell's hands  The discovery of the magnet seems to have been in very early times it is mentioned by Plato Lucretius Pliny and Galen and is said to have taken its name of magnes from Magnesia a seaport of antient Lybia  As every piece of iron which was made magnetical by the touch of a magnet became itself a magnet many attempts were made to improve these artificial magnets but without much success till Servingdon Savary Esq made them of  hardened  steel bars which were so powerful that one of them weighing three pounds averdupois would lift another of the same weight Philos Trans  After this Dr Knight made very successful experiments on this subject which though he kept his method secret seems to have excited others to turn their attention to magnetism At this time the Rev Mr Michell invented an equally efficacious and more expeditious way of making strong artificial magnets which he published in the end of the year in which he explained his method of what he called  the double touch  and which since Mr Knight's method has been known appears to be somewhat different from it  This method of rendering bars of hardened steel magnetical consists in holding vertically two or more magnetic bars nearly parallel to each other with their opposite poles very near each other but nevertheless separated to a small distance these are to be slided over a line of bars laid horizontally a few times backward and forward See Michell on Magnetism also a detailed account in Chamber's Dictionary  What Mr Michell proposed by this method was to include a very small portion of the horizontal bars intended to be made magnetical between the joint forces of two or more bars already magnetical and by sliding them from end to end every part of the line of bars became successively included and thus bars possessed of a very small degree of magnetism to begin with would in a few times sliding backwards and forwards make the other ones much more magnetical than themselves which are then to be taken up and used to touch the former which are in succession to be laid down horizontally in a line  There is still a great field remains for future discoveries in magnetism both in respect to experiment and theory the latter consists of vague conjectures the more probable of which are perhaps those of Elpinus as they assimulate it to electricity One conjecture I shall add viz that the polarity of magnetism may be owing to the earth's rotatory motion If heat electricity and magnetism are supposed to be fluids of different gravities heat being the heaviest of them electricity the next heavy and magnetism the lightest it is evident that by the quick revolution of the earth the heat will be accumulated most over the line electricity next beneath this and that the magnetism will be detruded to the poles and axis of the earth like the atmospheres of common air and of inflammable gas as explained in the note on Canto I l  Electricity and heat will both of them displace magnetism and this shews that they may gravitate on each other and hence when too great a quantity of the electric fluid becomes accumulated at the poles by descending snows or other unknown causes it may have a tendency to rise towards the tropics by its centrifugal force and produce the northern lights See additional notes No I  The polish'd rods with powers magnetic arm  With

decomposing vegetable and animal matters with vital air and of nitrous acid from azote and vital air the former of which is united to its basis by means of the exhalations from vegetable and animal matters constitute an analogy which induces us to believe that many other acids have either their bases or are united to vital air by means of some part of decomposing vegetable and animal matters  The great quantities of flint sand whether formed in mountains or in the sea would appear to derive its acid from the new world as it is found above the strata of limestone and granite which constitute the old world and as the earthy basis of flint is probably calcareous a great part of it seems to be produced by a conjunction of the new and old world the recrements of airbreathing animals and vegetables probably afford the acid and the shells of marine animals the earthy basis while another part may have derived its calcareous part also from the decomposition of vegetable and animal bodies  The same mode of reasoning seems applicable to the siliceous stones under various names as amethyst onyx agate mochoe opal c which do not seem to have undergone any process from volcanic fires and as these stones only differ from flint by a greater or less admixture of argillaceous and calcareous earths The different proportions of which in each kind of stone may be seen in

crystallized or vitreous matter conjectured that it was an inflammable body in some manner congealed Insomuch that all the light is reflected which falls on any of its interior surfaces at a greater angle of incidence than ½ degrees whereas an artificial gem of glass does not reflect any light from its hinder surface unless that surface is inclined in an angle of degrees Hence the diamond reflects half as much more light as a factitious gem in similar circumstances to which must be added its great transparency and the excellent polish it is capable of The diamond had nevertheless been placed at the head of crystals or precious stones by the mineralogists till Bergman ranged it of late in the combustible class of bodies because by the focus of Villette's burning mirror it was evaporated by a heat not much greater than will melt silver and gave out light Mr Hoepfner however thinks the dispersion of the diamond by this great heat should be called a phosphorescent evaporation of it rather than a combustion and from its other analogies of crystallization hardness transparency and place of its nativity wishes again to replace it amongst the precious stones Observ sur la

mythology was represented by Jupiter and the inferior air by Juno and the conjunction of these deities was said to produce the vernal showers and procreate all things as is further spoken of in Canto

was reckoned even in the time of Pliny among the lost arts of antiquity but which has lately been recovered by the ingenuity and industry of Mr Wedgwood It is supposed that the principal manufactories were about Nola at the foot of Vesuvius for it is in that neighbourhood that the greatest quantities of antique vases have been found and it is said that the general taste of the inhabitants is

volcanic airs to force  Through bubbling Lavas their resistless course  O'er the broad walls of rifted Granite climb  And pierce the rent roof of incumbent Lime  And pierce the rent roof  l The granite rocks and the limestone rocks have been cracked to very great depths at the time they were raised up by subterranean fires in these cracks are found most of the metallic ores except iron and perhaps manganese the former of which is generally found in horizontal strata and the latter generally near the surface of the earth  Philosophers possessing so convenient a test for the discovery of iron by the magnet have long since found it in all vegetable and animal matters and of late Mr Scheele has discovered the existence of manganese in vegetable ashes Scheele mem Stock Kirwan Min Which accounts for the production of it near the surface of earth and thence for its calciform appearance or union with vital air Bergman has likewise shewn that the limestones which become bluish or dark coloured when calcined possess a mixture of manganese and are thence preferable as a cement to other kinds of lime Bergman Which impregnation with manganese has probably been received from the decomposition of superincumbent vegetable matters  These cracks or perpendicular caverns in the granite or limestone pass to unknown depths and it is up these channels that I have endeavoured to shew that the steam rises which becomes afterwards condensed and produces the warm springs of this island and other parts of the world See note on Fucus Vol II And up these cracks I suppose certain vapours arise which either alone or by meeting with something descending into them from above have produced most of the metals and several of the materials in which they are bedded Thus the ponderous earth Barytes of Derbysbire is found in these cracks and is stratified frequently with leadore and frequently surrounds it This ponderous earth has been found by Dr Hoepfner in a granite in Switzerland and may have thus been sublimed from immense depths by great heat and have obtained its carbonic or vitriolic acid from above Annales de Chimie There is also reason to conclude that something from above is necessary to the formation of many of the metals at Hawkstone in Shropshire the seat of Sir Richard Hill there is an elevated rock of siliceous sand which is coloured green with copper in many places high in the air and I have in my possession a specimen of lead formed in the cavity of an iron nodule and another of lead amid spar from a crack of a coalstratum all which countenance the modern production of those metals from descending materials To which should be added that the highest mountains of granite which have therefore probably never been covered with marine productions on account of their early elevation nor with vegetable or animal matters on account of their great coldness contain no metallic ores whilst the lower ones contain copper and tin in their cracks or veins both in Saxony Silesia and Cornwall Kirwan's Mineral p  The transmutation of one metal into another though hitherto undiscovered by the alchymists does not appear impossible such transmutations have been supposed to exist in nature thus lapis calaminaris may have been produced from the destruction of leadore as it is generally found on the top of the veins of lead where it has been calcined or united with air and because masses of leadore are often found intirely inclosed in it So silver is found mixed in almost all leadores and sometimes in seperate filaments within the cavities of leadore as I am informed by Mr Michell and is thence probably a partial transmutation of the lead to silver the rapid progress of modern chemistry having shewn the analogy between metallic calces and acids

magnificent in the world In that vast expanse of desert from W to N W of us we saw a number of prodigious pillars of sand at different distances at times moving with great celerity at others stalking on with a majestic slowness at intervals we thought they were coming in a very few minutes to overwhelm us and small quantities of sand did actually more than once reach us Again they would retreat so as to be almost out of sight their tops reaching to the very clouds There the tops often separated from the bodies and these once disjoined dispersed in the air and did not appear more Sometimes they were broken in the middle as if struck with large cannonshot About noon they began to advance with considerable swiftness upon us the wind being very strong at north Eleven of them ranged along side of us about the distance of three miles The greatest diameter of the largest appeared to me at that distance as if it would measure ten feet They retired from us with a wind at S E leaving an impression upon my mind to which I can give no name though surely one ingredient in it was fear with a considerable deal of wonder and astonishment It was in vain to think of flying the swiftest horse or fastest sailing ship could be of no use to carry us out of this danger and the full persuasion of this rivetted me as if to the spot where I stood  The same appearance of moving pillars of sand presented themselves to us this day in form and disposition like those we had seen at Waadi Halboub only they seemed to be more in number and less in size They came several times in a direction close upon us that is I believe within less than two miles They began immediately after sun rise like a thick wood and almost darkened the sun His rays shining through them for near an hour gave them an appearance of pillars of fire Our people now became desperate the Greeks shrieked out and said it was the day of judgment Ismael pronounced it to be hell and the Turcorories that the world was on fire  Bruce's Travels Vol IV p  From this account it would appear that the eddies of wind were owing to the long range of broken rocks which bounded one side of the sandy desert and bent the currents of air which struck against their sides and were thus like the eddies in a stream of water which falls against oblique obstacles This explanation is probably the true one as these whirlwinds were not

mountainmists would penetrate these calcined parts and pulverize them by the force of the steam which the generated heat would produce the winds would disperse this limepowder and thus by repeated

 And guide and guard the transmigrating Ens  The transmigrating Ens  l The perpetual circulation of matter in the growth and dissolution of vegetable and animal bodies seems to have given Pythagoras his idea of the metempsycosis or transmigration of spirit which was afterwards dressed out or ridiculed in variety of amusing fables Other philosophers have supposed that there are two different materials or essences which fill the universe One of these which has the power of commencing or producing motion is called spirit the other which has the power of receiving and of communicating motion but not of beginning it is called matter The former of these is supposed to be diffused through all space filling up the interstices of the suns and planets and constituting the gravitations of the sidereal bodies the attractions of chemistry with the spirit of vegetation and of animation The latter occupies comparatively but small space constituting the solid parts of the suns and planets and their atmospheres Hence these philosophers have supposed that both matter and spirit are equally immortal and unperishable and that on the dissolution of vegetable or animal organization the matter returns to the general mass of matter and the spirit to the general mass of spirit to enter again into new combinations according to the original idea of Pythagoras  The small apparent quantity of matter that exists in the universe compared to that of spirit and the short time in which the recrements of animal or vegetable bodies become again vivified in the forms of vegetable mucor or microscopic insects seems to have given rise to another curious fable of antiquity That Jupiter threw down a large handful of souls upon the earth and left them to scramble for the few bodies which were to be had  "So when on Lebanon's sequester'd hight  The fair ADONIS left the realms of light  Adonis  l The very antient story of the beautiful Adonis passing one half of the year with Venus and the other with Proserpine alternately has had variety of interpretations Some have supposed that it allegorized the summer and winter solstice but this seems too obvious a fact to have needed an hieroglyphic emblem Others have believed it to represent the corn which was supposed to sleep in the earth during the winter months and to rise out of it in summer This does not accord with the climate of Egypt where the harvest soon follows the seedtime  It seems more probably to have been a story explaining some hieroglyphic figures representing the decomposition and resuscitation of animal matter a sublime and interesting subject and which seems to have given origin to the doctrine of the transmigration which had probably its birth also from the hieroglyphic treasures of Egypt It is remarkable that the cypress groves in the antient greek writers as in Theocritus were dedicated to Venus and afterwards became funereal emblems Which was probably occasioned by the Cypress being an accompaniment of Venus in the annual processions in which she was supposed to lament over the funeral of Adonis a ceremony which obtained over all the eastern world from great antiquity and is supposed to be referred to by Ezekiel who accuses the idolatrous woman of weeping for Thammus  Bow'd his bright locks and fated from his birth  To change eternal mingled with the earth  With darker

altered on account of the supposed false grammar in using the word drove for driven according to the opinion of Dr Lowth at the same time it may be observed l that this is in many cases only an ellipsis of the letter  n  at the end of the word as froze for frozen wove for woven spoke for spoken and that then the participle accidentally becomes similar to the past tense that the language

the particles of which are too small separately to overcome the tenacity of the air and which therefore do not descend They are in such small spheres as to repel each other that is they are applied to each other by such very small surfaces that the attraction of the particles of each drop to its own centre is greater than its attraction to the surface of the drop in its vicinity every one has observed with what difficulty small spherules of quicksilver can be made to unite owing to the same cause and it is common to see on riding through shallow water on a clear day numbers of very small spheres of water as they are thrown from the horses feet run along the surface for many yards before they again unite with it In many cases these spherules of water which compose clouds are kept from uniting by a surplus of electric fluid and fall in violent showers as soon as that is withdrawn from them as in thunder storms See note on Canto l  If in this state a cloud becomes frozen it is torn to pieces in its descent by the friction of the air and falls in white flakes of snow Or these flakes are rounded by being rubbed together by the winds and by having their angles thawed off by the warmer air beneath as they descend and part of the water produced by these angles thus dissolved is absorbed into the body of the hailstone as may be seen by holding a lump of snow over a candle and there becomes frozen into ice by the quantity of cold which the hailstone possesses beneath the freezing point or which is produced by its quick evaporation in falling and thus hailstones are often found of greater or less density according as they consist of a greater portion of snow or ice If hailstones consisted of the large drops of showers frozen in their descent they would consist of pure transparent ice  As hail is only produced in summer and is always attended with storms some philosophers have believed that the sudden departure of electriclty from a cloud may effect something yet unknown in this phenomenon but it may happen in summer independent of electricity because the aqueous vapour is then raised higher in the atmosphere whence it has further to fall and there is warmer

During the coldness of the night the moisture before dissolved in the air is gradually precipitated and as it subsides adheres to the bodies it falls upon Where the attraction of the body to the particles of water is greater than the attractions of those particles to each other it becomes spread upon their surface or slides down them in actual contact as on the broad parts of the blades of moist grass where the attraction of the surface to the water is less than the attraction of the particles of water to each other the dew stands in drops as on the points and edges of grass or gorse where the surface presented to the drop being small it attracts it so little as but just to support it without much changing its globular form where there is no attraction between the vegetable surface and the dew drops as on cabbage leaves the drop does not come into contact with the leaf but hangs over it repelled and retains it natural form composed of the attraction and pressure of its own parts and thence looks like quicksilver reflecting light from both its surfaces Nor is this owing to any oiliness of the leaf but simply to the polish of its surface as a light needle may be laid on water in the same manner without touching it for as the attractive powers of polished surfaces are greater when in actual contact so the repulsive power is greater before contact  YOUR lucid bands condense with fingers chill  The blue mist hovering round the gelid hill  The blue mist  l Mists are clouds resting on the ground they generally come on at the beginning of night and either fill the moist vallies or hang on the summits of hills according to the degree of moisture previously dissolved and the education of heat from them The air over rivers during the warmth of the day suspends much moisture and as the changeful surface of rivers occasions them to cool sooner than the land at the approach of evening mists are most frequently seen to begin over rivers and to spread themselves over moist grounds and fill the vallies while the mists on the tops of mountains are more properly clouds condensed by the coldness of their situation  On ascending up the side of a hill from a misty valley I have observed a beautiful coloured halo round the moon when a certain thickness of mist was over me which ceased to be visible as soon as I emerged out of it and well remember admiring with other spectators the shadow of the three spires of the cathedral church at Lichfield the moon rising behind it apparently broken off and lying distinctly over our heads as if horizontally on the surface of the mist which arose about as high as the roof of the church There are some curious remarks on shadows or reflections seen on the surface of mists from high mountains in Ulloa's Voyages The dry mist of summer was probably occasioned by volcanic eruption as mentioned in note on Chunda Vol II and therefore more like the atmosphere of smoke which hangs on still days over great cities  There is a dry mist or rather a diminished transparence of the air which according to Mr Saussure accompanies fair weather while great transparence of air indicates rain Thus when large rivers two miles broad such as at Liverpool appear narrow it is said to prognosticate rain and when wide fair weather This want of transparence of the air in dry weather may be owing to new combinations or

zenith with refulgent wheels  Car'd on the foam your glimmering legion rides  Car'd on the foam  l The phenomena of the tides have been well investigated and satisfactorily explained by Sir Isaac Newton and Dr Halley from the reciprocal gravitations of the earth moon and sun As the earth and moon move round a centre of motion near the earth's surface at the same time that they are proceeding in their annual orbit round the sun it follows that the water on the side of the earth nearest this centre of motion between the earth and moon will be more attracted by the moon and the waters on the opposite side of the earth will be less attracted by the moon than the central parts of the earth Add to this that the centrifugal force of the water on the side of the earth furthest from the centre of the motion round which the earth and moon move which as was said before is near the surface of the earth is greater than that on the opposite side of the earth From both these causes it is easy to comprehend that the water will rise on two sides of the earth viz on that nearest to the moon and its opposite side and that it will be flattened in consequence at the quadratures and thus produce two tides in every lunar day which consists of about twentyfour hours and fortyeight minutes  These tides will be also affected by the solar attraction when it coincides with the lunar one or opposes it as at new and full moon and will also be much influenced by the opposing shores in every part of the earth  Now as the moon in moving round the centre of gravity between itself and the earth describes a much larger orbit than the earth describes round the same centre it follows that the centrifugal motion on the side of the moon opposite to the earth must be much greater than the centrifugal motion of the side of the earth opposite to the moon round the same centre And secondly as the attraction of the earth exerted on the moon's surface next to the earth is much greater than the attraction of the moon exerted on the earth's surface the tides on the lunar sea if such there be should be much greater than those of our ocean Add to this that as the same face of the moon always is turned to the earth the lunar tides must be permanent and if the solid parts of the moon be spherical must always cover the phasis next to us But as there are evidently hills and vales and volcanos on this side of the moon the consequence is that the moon has no ocean or that it is frozen  Your little tridents heave the dashing tides  Urge on the sounding shores their crystal course  Restrain their fury or

of covering the long tail of the fish with calcareous armour since a single thin partition between the adjoining circles of the fish was sufficient to defend both surfaces and thus much cretaceous matter is saved and it is probable that from this spiral form they are better enabled to feel the vibrations of the element in which they exist See note on Canto IV l This cretaceous matter is formed by a mucous secretion from the skin of the fish as is seen in crabfish and others which annually cast their shells and is at first a soft mucous covering like that of a hen's egg when it is laid a day or two too soon and which gradually hardens This may also be seen in common shell snails if a part of their shell be broken it becomes repaired in a similar manner with mucus which by degrees hardens into shell  It it probable the calculi or stones found in other animals may have a similar origin as they are formed on mucous membranes as those of the kidney and bladder chalkstones in the gout and gallstones and are probably owing to the inflammation of the membrane where they are produced and vary according to the degree of inflammation of the membrane which forms them and the kind of mucous which it naturally produces Thus the shelly matter of different shellfish differs from the courser kinds which form the shells of crabs to the finer kinds which produces the motherpearl  The beautiful colours of some shells originate from the thinness of the laminae of which they consist rather than to any colouring matter as is seen in motherpearl which reflects different colours according to the obliquity of the light which falls on it The beautiful prismatic colours seen on the Labrodore stone are owing to a similar cause viz the thinness of the laminae of which it consists and has probably been formed from motherpearl shells  It is curious that some of the most common fossil shells are not now known in their recent state as the cornua ammonis and on the contrary many shells which are very plentiful in their recent state as limpets seaears volutes cowries are very rarely found fossil Da Costa's Conchology p Were all the ammoniae destroyed when the continents were raised Or do some

they are formed like the hard concretions in many land animals as stones of the bladder gallstones and bezoar and hence concludes them to be a disease of the fish but there seems to be a stricter analogy between these and the calcareous productions found in crabfish called crab's eyes which are formed near the stomach of the animal and constitute a reservoir of calcareous matter against the renovation of the shell at which time they are redissolved and deposited for that purpose As the internal part of the shell of the pearl oyster or muscle consists of motherpearl which is a similar material to the pearl and as the animal has annually occasion to enlarge his shell there is reason to suspect the loose pearls are similar reservoirs of the pearly matter for that purpose  "YOUR

mountains by the same cause and large portions of earth have been removed many hundred yards from their situations at the foot of mountains On inspecting the locomotion of about thirty acres of earth with a small house near Bilder's Bridge in Shropshire about twenty years ago from the foot of a mountain towards the river I well remember it bore all the marks of having been thus lifted up pushed away and as it were crumpled into ridges by a column of water contained in the mountain  From water being thus confined in high columns between the strata of mountainous countries it has often happened that when wells or perforations have been made into the earth that springs have arisen much above the surface of the new well When the new bridge was building at Dublin Mr G Semple found a spring in the bed of the river where he meant to lay the foundation of a pierre which by fixing iron pipes into it he raised many feet Treatise on Building in Water by G Semple From having observed a valley northwest of St Alkmond's well near Derby at the head of which that spring of water once probably existed and by its current formed the valley but which in after times found its way out in its

peculiar situations of land in respect to sea the tropic becomes more heated when the sun is vertical over it than the line the periodical winds called monsoons are produced and these are attended by rainy seasons for as the air at the tropic is now more heated than at the line it ascends by decrease of its specific gravity and floods of air rush in both from the South West and North East and these being one warmer than the other the rain is precipitated by their mixture as observed by Dr Hutton See additional notes No XXV All late travellers have ascribed the rise of the Nile to the monsoons which deluge Nubia and Abyssinia with rain The whirling of the ascending air was even seen by Mr Bruce in Abyssinia he says  every morning a small cloud began to whirl round and presently after the whole heavens became covered with clouds  by this vortex of ascending air the N E winds and the S W winds which flow in to supply the place of the ascending column became mixed more rapidly and deposited their rain in greater abundance  Mr Volney observes that the time of the rising of the Nile commences about the th of June and that Abyssinia and the adjacent parts of Africa are deluged with rain in May June and July and produce a mass of water which is three months in draining off The Abbe Le Pluche observes that as Sirius or the dogstar rose at the time of the commencement of the

from rain falling upon them one where the constant tradewinds meet beneath the line for here two regions of warm air are mixed together and thence do not seem to have any cause to precipitate their vapour and the other is where the winds are brought from colder climates and become warmer by their contact with the earth of a warmer one Thus Lower Egypt is a flat country warmed by the sun more than the higher lands of one side of it and than the Mediterranean on the other and hence the winds which blow over it acquire greater warmth which ever way they come than they possessed before and in consequence have a tendency to acquire and not to part with their vapour like the northeast winds of this country There is said to be a narrow spot upon the coast of Peru where rain seldom occurs at the same time according to Ulloa on the mountainous regions of the Andes beyond there is almost perpetual rain For the wind blows uniformly upon this hot part of the coast of Peru but no cause of

rose to the height of ninetytwo feet On cooling it deposited a siliceous matter or chalcedony forming a bason round its base The heat of this water before it rose out of the earth could not be ascertained as water looses all its heat above as soon as it is at liberty to expand by the exhalation of a part but the flinty bason which is deposited from it shews that water with great degrees of heat will dissolve siliceous matter Van Troil's Letters on Iceland Since the above account in the year this part of Iceland has been destroyed by an earthquake or covered with lava which was probably

surface of the earth but that they are produced by steam rising up the fissures of the mountains from great depths owing to water falling on subterraneous fires and that this steam is condensed between the strata of the incumbent mountains and collected into springs For further proofs on this subject the reader is referred to a Letter from Dr Darwin in Mr Pilkington's View of Derbyshire Vol

but degrees of heat but is nevertheless a cold bath compared to the heat of the body which is On going into this bath there is therefore always a chill perceived at the first immersion but after having been in it a minute the chill ceases and a sensation of warmth succeeds though the body continues to be immersed in the water The cause of this curious phenomenon is to be looked for in the laws of animal sensation and not from any properties of heat When a person goes from clear daylight into an obscure room for a while it appears gloomy which gloom however in a little time ceases and the deficiency of light becomes no longer perceived This is not solely owing to the enlargement of the iris of the eye since that is performed in an instant but to this law of sensation that when a less stimulus is applied within certain bounds the sensibility increases Thus at going into a bath as much colder than the body as that of Buxton the diminution of heat on the skin is at first perceived but in about a minute the sensibility to heat increases and the nerves of the skin are equally excited by the lessened stimulus The sensation of warmth at emerging from a coldbath and the pain called the hotach after the hands have been immersed in snow depend on the same principle viz the increased sensibility of the skin after having been previously exposed to a stimulus less than

And to pure air  l Until very lately water was esteemed a simple element nor are all the most celebrated chemists of Europe yet converts to the new opinion of its decomposition Mr Lavoisier and others of the French school have most ingeniously endeavoured to shew that water consists of pure air called by them oxygene and of inflammable air called hydrogene with as much of the matter of heat or calorique as is necessary to preserve them in the form of gas Gas is distinguished from steam by its preserving its elasticity under the pressure of the atmosphere and in the greatest degrees of cold yet known The history of the progress of this great discovery is detailed in the Memoires of the Royal Academy for and the experimental proofs of it are delivered in Lavoisier's Elements of Chemistry The results of which are that water consists of eightyfive parts by weight of oxygene and fifteen parts by weight of hydrogene with a sufficient quantity of Calorique Not only numerous chemical phenomena but many atmospherical and vegetable facts receive clear and beautiful elucidation from this important analysis In the atmosphere inflammable air is probably perpetually uniting with vital air and producing moisture which descends in dews and showers while the growth of vegetables by the assistance of light is perpetually again decomposing the water they imbibe from the earth and while they retain the inflammable air for the formation of oils wax honey resin c they give up the vital air to replenish the atmosphere  Round their translucent forms at once they fling  Their rapturous

production of water from pure air or oxygene and inflammable air or hydrogene which from its greater levity probably resides over the former that one should be tempted to believe that the very antient chemists of Egypt had discovered the composition of water and thus represented it in their hieroglyphic figures before the invention of letters  In the passage of Virgil Jupiter is called ether and

Latins machina Ctesebiana but it was long before it was known that the ascent of the piston lifted the superincumbent column of the atmosphere and that then the pressure of the surrounding air on the surface of the well below forced the water up into the vacuum and that on that account in the common lifting pump the water would rise only about thirtyfive feet as the weight of such a column of water was in general an equipoise to the surrounding atmosphere The foamy appearance of water when the pressure of the air over it is diminished is owing to the expansion and escape of the air previously dissolved by it or existing in its pores When a child first sucks it only presses or champs the teat as observed by the great Harvey but afterwards it learns to make an incipient vacuum in its mouth and acts by removing the pressure of the atmosphere from the nipple like a pump  Bade with quick stroke the sliding piston bear  The viewless columns of incumbent air  Press'd by the

horizontally Another kind of machine was invented by one Greyl in which a vessel of water was every way dispersed by the explosion of gunpowder lodging in the centre of it and lighted by an adapted

this surface and is destroyed by being smeared with oil in these respects resembling the lungs of animals or the spiracula of insects To prevent these injuries some leaves repel the dewdrops from their upper surfaces as those of cabbages other vegetables close the upper furfaces of their leaves together in the night or in wet weather as the sensitive plant others only hang their leaves downwards so as to shoot the wet from them as kidneybeans and many trees See note on of this Canto  And close the timorous floret's golden bell  Golden bell  l There are muscles placed about the footstalks of the leaves or leaflets of many plants for the purpose of closing their upper surfaces together or of bending them down so as to shoot off the showers or dewdrops as mentioned in the preceeding note The claws of the petals or of the divisions of the calyx of many flowers are furnished in a similar manner with muscles which are exerted to open or close the corol and calyx of the flower as in tragopogon anemone This action of opening and closing the leaves or flowers does not appear to be produced simply by  irritation  on the muscles themselves but by the connection of those muscles with a  sensitive  sensorium or brain existing in each individual bud or flower st Because many flowers close from the defect of stimulus not by the excess of it as by darkness which is the absence of the stimulus of light or by cold which is the absence of the stimulus of heat Now the defect of heat or the absence of food or of drink affects our  sensations  which had been previously accustomed to a greater quantity of them but a muscle cannot be said to be stimulated into action by a defect of stimulus Because the muscles around the footstalks of the subdivisions of the leaves of the sensitive plant are exerted when any injury is offered to the other extremity of the leaf and some of the stamens of the flowers of the class Syngenesia contract themselves when others are irritated See note on Chondrilla Vol II of this work  From this circumstance the contraction of the muscles of vegetables seems to depend on a disagreeable  sensation  in some distant part and not on the  irritation  of the muscles themselves Thus when a particle of dust stimulates the ball of the eye the eyelids are instantly closed and when too much light pains the retina the muscles of the iris contract its aperture and this not by any connection or consent of the nerves of those parts but as an effort to prevent or to remove a disagreeable sensation which evinces that vegetables are endued with sensation or that each bud has a common sensorium and is furnished with a brain or a central place where its nerves were connected  "So should young SYMPATHY in female form  Climb the tall rock

flooding lands long in use in China has been but lately introduced into this country Besides the supplying water to the herbage in dryer seasons it seems to defend it from frost in the early part of the year and thus doubly advances the vegetation The waters which rise from springs passing through marl or limestone are replete with calcareous earth and when thrown over morasses they deposit this earth and incrust or consolidate the morass This kind of earth is deposited in great quantity from the springs at Matlock bath and supplies the soft porous limestone of which the houses and walls are there constructed and has formed the whole bank for near a mile on that side of the Derwent on which they stand  The water of many springs contains much azotic gas or phlogistic air besides carbonic gas or fixed air as that of Buxton and Bath this being set at liberty may more readily contribute to the production of nitre by means of the putrescent matters which it is exposed to by being spread upon the surface of the land in the same manner as frequently turning over heaps of manure facilitates the nitrous process by imprisoning atmospheric air in the interstices of the putrescent materials Water arising by landfloods brings along with it much of the most soluble parts of the manure from the higher lands to the lower ones Riverwater in its clear state and those springs which are called soft are less beneficial for the purpose of watering lands as they contain less earthy or saline matter and water from dissolving snow from its slow solution brings but little earth along with it as may be seen by the comparative clearness of the water of snowfloods  So shall my peopled realms of Leaf and Flower  Exult inebriate with the genial shower  Dip their long tresses from the mossy brink

lips invite  And wed the enamour'd OXYGENE to LIGHT  The enamour'd oxygene  l The common air of the atmosphere appears by the analysis of Dr Priestley and other philosophers to consist of about three parts of an elastic fluid unfit for respiration or combustion called azote by the French school and about one fourth of pure vital air fit for the support of animal life and of combustion called oxygene The principal source of the azote is probably from the decomposition of all vegetable and animal matters by putrefaction and combustion the principal source of vital air or oxygene is perhaps from the decomposition of water in the organs of vegetables by means of the sun's light The difficulty of injecting vegetable vessels seems to shew that their perspirative pores are much less than those of animals and that the water which constitutes their perspiration is so divided at the time of its exclusion that by means of the sun's light it becomes decomposed the inflammable air or hydrogene which is one of its constituent parts being retained to form the oil resin wax honey c of the vegetable economy and the other part which united with light or heat becomes vital air or oxygene gas rises into the atmosphere and replenishes it with the food of life  Dr Priestley has evinced by very ingenious experiments that the blood gives out phlogiston and receives vital air or oxygenegas by the lungs And Dr Crawford has shewn that the blood acquires heat from this vital air in respiration There is however still a something more subtil than heat which must be obtained in respiration from the vital air a something which life can not exist a few minutes without which seems necessary to the vegetable as well as to the animal world and which as no organized vessels can confine it requires perpetually to be renewed See note on Canto l  Round their white necks with fingers interwove  Cling the fond Pair with unabating love  Hand link'd in hand on buoyant step they

with great pleasure contemplating the rugged tops of Chiggre where we expected to solace ourselves with plenty of good water Idris cried out with a loud voice "fall upon your faces for here is the simoom" I saw from the S E a haze come in colour like the purple part of a rainbow but not so compressed or thick it did not occupy twenty yards in breadth and was about twelve feet high from the ground It was a kind of a blush upon the air and it moved very rapidly for I scarce could turn to fall upon the ground with my head to the northward when I felt the heat of its current plainly upon my face We all lay flat upon the ground as if dead till Idris told us it was blown over The meteor or purple haze which I saw was indeed passed but the light air that still blew was of heat to threaten suffocation For my part I found distinctly in my breast that I had imbibed a part of it nor was I free of an asthmatic sensation till I had been some months in Italy  Bruce's Travels Vol IV p  It is difficult to account for the narrow track of this pestilential wind which is said not to exceed twenty yards and for its small elevation of twelve feet A whirlwind will pass forwards and throw down an avenue of trees by its quick revolution as it passes but nothing like a whirling is described as happening in these narrow streams of air and whirlwinds ascend to greater heights There seems but one known manner in which this channel of air could be effected and that is by electricity  The volcanic origin of these winds is mentioned in the note on Chunda in Vol II of this work it must here be added that Professor Vairo at Naples found that during the eruption of Vesuvius perpendicular iron bars were electric and others have observed suffocating damps to attend these eruptions Ferber's Travels in Italy p And lastly that a current of air attends the passage of electric matter as is seen in presenting an electrized point to the flame of a candle In Mr Bruce's account of this simoom it was in its course over a quite dry desert of sand and which was in consequence unable to conduct an electric stream into the earth beneath it to some moist rocks at but a few miles distance and thence would appear to be a stream of electricity from a volcano attended with noxious air and as the bodies of Mr Bruce and his attendants were insulated on the sand they would not be sensible of their increased electricity as it passed over them to which it may be added that a sulphurous or suffocating sensation is said to accompany flashes of lightning and even strong sparks of artificial electricity In the above account of the simoom a great redness in the air is said to be a certain sign of its approach which may be occasioned by the eruption of flame from a distant volcano in these

the atmosphere was discovered by Torricelli a disciple of Galileo who had previously found that the air had weight Dr Hook and M Du Hamel ascribe the invention of the airpump to Mr Boyle who however confesses he had some hints concerning its construction from De Guerick The vacancy at the summit of the barometer is termed the Torricellian vacuum and the exhausted receiver of an air pump the Boylean vacuum in honour of these two philosophers  The mist and descending dew which appear at first exhausting the receiver of an airpump are explained in the Phil Trans Vol LXXVIII from the cold produced by the expansion of air For a thermometer placed in the receiver sinks some degrees and in a very little time as soon as a sufficient quantity of heat can be acquired from the surrounding bodies the dew becomes again taken up See additional notes No VII Mr Saussure observed on placing his hygrometer in a receiver of an airpump that though on beginning to exhaust it the air became misty and parted with its moisture yet the hair of his hygrometer contracted and the instrument pointed to greater dryness This unexpected occurrence is explained by M Monge Annales de Chymie Tom V to depend on the want of the usual pressure of the atmosphere to force the aqueous particles into the pores of the hair and M Saussure supposes that his vesicular vapour requires more time to be redissolved than is necessary to dry the hair of his thermometer Essais sur l'Hygrom p but I suspect there is a less hypothetical way of understanding it when a colder body is brought into warm and moist air as a bottle of springwater for instance a steam is quickly collected on its surface the contrary occurs when a warmer body is brought into cold and damp air it continues free from dew so long as it continues warm for it warms the atmosphere around it and renders it capable of receiving instead of parting with moisture The moment the air becomes rarefied in the receiver of the airpump it becomes colder as appears by the thermometer and deposits its vapour but the hair of Mr Saussure's hygrometer is now warmer than the air in which it is immersed and in consequence becomes dryer

stroke of a pin at the other end becomes sensible if a poker be suspended in the middle of a garter each end of which is pressed against the ear the least percussions on the poker give great sounds And I am informed by laying the ear on the ground the tread of a horse may be discerned at a great distance in the night The organs of hearing belonging to fish are for this reason much less complicated than of quadrupeds as the fluid they are immersed in so much better conveys its vibrations And it is probable that some shellfish which have twisted shells like the cochlea and

"SYLPHS YOU retiring to sequester'd bowers  Where oft your PRIESTLEY WOOS your airy powers  Where oft your Priestley  l The same of Dr Priestley is known in every part of the earth where science has penetrated His various discoveries respecting the analysis of the atmosphere and the production of variety of new airs or gasses can only be clearly understood by reading his Experiments on Airs vols octavo Johnson London the following are amongst his many discoveries The discovery of nitrous and dephlogisticated airs The exhibition of the acids and alkalies in the form of air Ascertaining the purity of respirable air by nitrous air The restoration of vitiated air by vegetation The influence of light to enable vegetables to yield pure air The conversion by means of light of animal and vegetable substances that would otherwise become putrid and offensive into nourishment of vegetables The use of respiration by the blood parting with phlogiston and imbibing dephlogisticated air  The experiments here alluded to are Concerning the production of nitrous gas from dissolving iron and many other metals in nitrous acid which though first discovered by Dr Hales Static Ess Vol I p was fully investigated and applied to the important purpose of distinguishing the purity of atmospheric air by Dr Priestley When about two measures of common air and one of nitrous gas are mixed together a red effervescence takes place and the two airs occupy about one fourth less space than was previously occupied by the common air alone  Concerning the green substance which grows at the bottom of reservoirs of water which Dr Priestley discovered to yield much pure air when the sun shone on it His method of collecting this air is by placing over the green substance which he believes to be a vegetable of the genus conferva an inverted bellglass previously filled with water which subsides as the air arises it has since been found that all vegetables give up pure air from their leaves when the sun shines upon them but not in the night which may be owing to the sleep of the plant  The third refers to the great quantity of pure air contained in the calces of metals The calces were long known to weigh much more than the metallic bodies before calcination insomuch that pounds of lead will produce pounds of minium the ore of manganese which is always found near the surface of the earth

be applied to the improvement of the diving bell as the substances which contain vital air in immense quantities are of little value as manganese and minium See additional notes No XXXIII In every hundred weight of minium there is combined about twelve pounds of pure air now as sixty pounds of water are about a cubic foot and as air is eight hundred times lighter than water five hundred weight of minium will produce eight hundred cubic feet of air or about six thousand gallons Now as this is at least thrice as pure as atmospheric air a gallon of it may be supposed to serve for three minutes respiration for one man At present the air can not be set at liberty from minium by viriolic acid without the application of some heat this is however very likely soon to be discovered and will then enable adventurers to journey beneath the ocean in large inverted ships or diving balloons  Mr Boyle relates that Cornelius Drebelle contrived not only a vessel to be rowed under water but also a liquor to be caried in that vessel which would supply the want of fresh air The vessel was made by order of James I and carried twelve rowers besides passengers It was tried in the river Thames and

in the art of constructing and managing the diving bell and had practised the business many years with success He went down accompanied by one of his young men twice to view the wreck of the Imperial

acquired leaves to convert it into nourishment In some plants these lobes rise from the earth and supply the place of leaves as in kidneybeans cucumbers and hence seem to serve both as a placenta to the foetus and lungs to the young plant During the process of germination the starch of the seed is converted into sugar as is seen in the procese of malting barley for the purpose of brewing And is

advised to bind some of the most vigorous shoots with strong wire and even some of the large roots and Mr Warner cuts what he calls a wild worm about the body of the tree or scores the bark quite to the wood like a screw with a sharp knife Bradley on Gardening Vol II p Mr Fitzgerald produced flowers and fruit on wall trees by cutting off a part of the bark Phil Trans Ann M Buffon produced the same effect by a straight bandage put round a branch Act Paris Ann and concludes that an ingrafted branch bears better from its vessels being compressed by the callous  A compleat cylinder of the bark about an inch in height was cut off from the branch of a pear tree against a wall in Mr Howard's garden at Lichfield about five years ago the circumcised part is now not above half the diameter of the branch above and below it yet this branch has been full of fruit every year since when the other branches of the tree bore only sparingly I lately observed that the leaves of this wounded branch were smaller and paler and the fruit less in size and ripened sooner than on the other parts of the tree Another branch has the bark taken off not quite all round with much the same effect  The theory of this curious vegetable fact has been esteemed difficult but receives great light from the foregoing account of the individuallity of buds A flowerbud dies when it has perfected its seed like an annual plant and hence requires no place on the bark for new roots to pass downwards but on the contrary leafbuds as they advance into shoots form new buds in the axilla of every leaf which new buds require new roots to pass down the bark and thus thicken as well as elongate the branch now if a wire or string be tied round the bark many of these new roots cannot descend and thence more of the buds will be converted into flowerbuds  A wiry ringlet round the swelling rind  Bisect with chissel fine the root below  Or bend to earth the inhospitable bough  And bend to earth  l Mr Hitt in his treatise on fruit trees observes that if a vigorous branch of a wall tree be bent to the horizon or beneath it it looses its vigour and becomes a bearing branch The theory of this I suppose to depend on the difficulty with which the leafshoots can protrude the roots necessary for their new progeny of buds upwards along the bended branch to the earth contrary to their natural habits or powers whence more flowershoots are produced which do not require new roots to pass along the bark of the bended branch but which let their offspring the seeds fall upon the earth and seek roots for themselves  So shall

the fruit ingrafted on other stocks  There is an apple described in Bradley's work which is said to have one side of it a sweet fruit which boils soft and the other side a sour fruit which boils hard which Mr Bradley so long ago as the year ingeniously ascribes to the farina of one of these apples impregnating the other which would seem the more probable if we consider that each division of an

atmosphere in which or between them are produced four kinds of meteors lightning shooting stars fireballs and northern lights First the lower region of air or that which is dense enough to resist by the adhesion of its particles the descent of condensed vapour or clouds which may extend from one to three or four miles high In this region the common lightning is produced from the accumulation or defect of electric matter in those floating fields of vapour either in respect to each other or in respect to the earth beneath them or the dissolved vapour above them which is constantly varying both with the change of the form of the clouds which thus evolve a greater or less surface and also with their everchanging degree of condensation As the lightning is thus produced in dense air it proceeds but a short course on account of the greater resistance which it encounters is attended with a loud explosion and appears with a red light  The second region of the atmosphere I suppose to be that which has too little tenacity to support condensed vapour or clouds but which yet contains invisible vapour or water in aerial solution This aerial solution of water differs from that dissolved in the matter of heat as it is supported by its adhesion to the particles of air and is not precipitated by cold In this stratum it seems probable that the meteors called shooting stars are produced and that they consist of electric sparks or lightning passing from one region to another of these invisible fields of aeroaqueous solution The height of these shooting stars has not yet been ascertained by sufficient observation Dr Blagden thinks their situation is lower down in the atmosphere than that of fireballs which he conjectures from their swift apparent motion and ascribes their smallness to the more minute division of the electric matter of which they are supposed to consist owing to  the geater resistance of the denser medium through which they pass than that in which the fireballs exist Mr Brydone observed that the shooting stars appeared to him to be as high in the atmosphere when he was near the summit of mount Etna as they do when observed from the plain Phil Tran Vol LXIII  As the stratum of air in which shooting stars are supposed to exist is much rarer than that in which lightning resides and yet much denser than that in which fireballs are produced they will be attracted at a greater distance than the former and at a less than the latter From this rarity of the air so small a sound will be produced by their explosion as not to reach the lower parts of the atmosphere their quantity of light from their greater distance being small is never seen through dense air at all and thence does not appear red like lightning or fire balls There are no apparent clouds to emit or to attract them because the constituent parts of these aeroaqueous regions may possess an abundance or deficiency of electric matter and yet be in perfect reciprocal solution And lastly their apparent train of light is probably owing only to a continuance of their impression on the eye as when a firestick is whirled in the dark it gives the appearance of a compleat circle of fire for these white trains of shooting stars quickly vanish and do not seem to set any thing on fire in their passage as seems to happen in the transit of fireballs  The second region or stratum of air terminates I suppose where the twilight ceases to be refracted that is where the air is times rarer than at the surface of the earth and where it seems probable that the common air ends and is surrounded by an atmosphere of inflammable gas tenfold rarer than itself In this region I believe fireballs sometimes to pass and at other times the northern lights to exist One of these fireballs or draco volans was observed by Dr Pringle and many others on Nov which was afterwards estimated to have been a mile and a half in circumference to have been about one hundred miles high and to have moved towards the north with a velocity of near thirty miles in a second of time This meteor had a real tail many miles long which threw off sparks in its course and the whole exploded with a sound like distant thunder Philos Trans Vol LI  Dr Blagden has related the history of another large meteor or fireball which was seen the th of August with many ingenious observations and conjectures This was estimated to be between and miles high and to travel miles at the rate of about twenty miles in a second This fireball had likewise a real train of light left behind it in its passage which varied in colour and in some part of its course gave off sparks or explosions where it had been brightest and a dusky red streak remained visible perhaps a minute Philos Trans Vol LXXIV  These fireballs differ from lightning and from shooting stars in many remarkable circumstances as their very great bulk being a mile and a half in diameter their travelling miles nearly horizontally their throwing off sparks in their passage and changing colours from bright blue to dusky red and leaving a train of fire behind them continuing about a minute They differ from the northern lights in not being diffused but passing from one point of the heavens to another in a defined line and this in a region above the crepuscular atmosphere where the air is times rarer than at the  surface of the earth There has not yet been even a conjecture which can account for these appearancesOne I shall therefore hazard which if it does not inform may amuse the reader  In the note on l it was shewn that there is probably a supernatant stratum of inflammable gas or hydrogene over the common atmosphere and whose density at the surface where they meet must be at least ten times less than that upon which it swims like chemical ether floating upon water and perhaps without any real contact In this region where the aerial atmosphere terminates and the inflammable one begins the quantity of tenacity or resistance must be almost inconceivable in which a ball of electricity might pass miles with greater ease than through a thousandth part of an inch of glass Such a ball of electricity passing between inflammable and common air would set fire to them in a line as it passed along which would differ in colour according to the greater proportionate commixture of the two airs and from the same cause there might occur greater degrees of inflammation or branches of fire in some parts of its course  As these fireballs travel in a defined line it is pretty evident from the known laws of electricity that they must be attracted and as they are a mile or more in diameter they must be emitted from a large surface of electric matter because large nobs give larger sparks less diffused and more brightly luminous than less ones or points and resist more forceably the emission of the electric matter What is there in nature can attract them at so great a distance as miles and so forceably as to detach an electric spark of a mile diameter Can volcanos at the time of their eruptions have this effect as they are generally attended with lightning Future observations must discover these secret operations of nature As a stream of common air is carried along with the passage of electric aura from one body to another it is easy to conceive that the common air and the inflammable air between which the fireball is supposed to pass will be partially intermixed by being thus agitated and so far as it becomes intermixed it will take fire and produce the linear flame and branching sparks above described In this circumstance of their being attracted and thence passing in a defined line the fireballs seem to differ from the coruscations of the aurora borealis or northern lights which probably take place in the same region of the atmosphere where the common air exists in extreme tenuity and is covered by a still rarer sphere of inflammable gas ten times lighter than itself  As the electric streams which constitute these northern lights seem to be repelled or radiated from an accumulation of that fluid in the north and not attracted like the fireballs this accounts for the diffusion of their light as well as the silence of their passage while their variety of colours and the permanency of them and even the breadth of them in different places may depend on their setting on fire the mixture of inflammable and common air through which they pass as seems to happen in the transit of the fireballs  It was observed by Dr Priestley that the electric shock taken through inflammable air was red in common air it is blueish to these circumstances perhaps some of the colours of the northern lights may bear analogy though the density of the medium through which light is seen must principally vary its colour as is well explained by Mr Morgan Phil Trans Vol LXXV Hence lightning is red when seen through a dark cloud or near the horizon because the more refrangible rays cannot permeate so dense a medium But the shooting stars consist of white light as they are generally seen on clear nights and nearly vertical in other situations their light is probably too faint to come to us But as in some remarkable appearances of the northern lights as in March all the prismatic colours were seen quickly to succeed each other these appear to have been owing to real combustion as the density of the interposed medium could not be supposed to change so frequently and therefore these colours must have been owing to different degrees of heat according to Mr Morgan's theory of combustion In Smith's Optics p the prismatic colours and optical deceptions of the northern lights are described by Mr Cotes  The Torricellian vacuum if perfectly free from air is said by Mr Morgan and others to be a perfect nonconductor This circumstance therefore would preclude the electric streams from rising above the atmosphere But as Mr Morgan did not try to pass an electric shock through a vacuum and as air or something containing air surrounding the transit of electricity may be necessary to the production of light the conclusion may perhaps still be dubious If however the streams of the northern lights were supposed to rise above our atmosphere they would only be visible at each extremity of their course where they emerge from or are again immerged into the atmosphere but not in their journey through the vacuum for the absence of electric light in a vacuum is sufficiently proved by the common experiment of shaking a barometer in the dark the electricity produced by the friction of the mercury in the glass at its top is luminous if the barometer has a little air in it but there is no light if the vacuum be complete  The aurora borealis or northern dawn is very ingeniously accounted for by Dr Franklin on principles of electricity He premises the following electric phenomena that all new fallen snow has much positive electricity standing on its surface That about twelve degrees of latitude round the poles are covered with a crust of eternal ice which is impervious to the electric fluid That the dense part of the atmosphere rises but a few miles high and that in the rarer parts of it the electric fluid will pass to almost any distance  Hence he supposes there must be a great accumulation of positive electric matter on the fresh fallen snow in the polar regions which not being able to pass through the crust of ice into the earth must rise into the rare air of the upper parts of our atmosphere which will the least resist its passage and passing towards the equator descend again into the denser atmosphere and thence into the earth in silent streams And that many of the appearances attending these lights are optical deceptions owing to the situation of the eye that beholds them which makes all ascending parallel lines appear to converge to a point  The idea above explained in note on l of the existence of a sphere of inflammable gas over the aerial atmosphere would much favour this theory of Dr Franklin because in that case the dense aerial atmosphere would rise a much less height in the polar regions diminishing almost to nothing at the pole itself and thus give an easier passage to the ascent of the electric fluid And from the great difference in the specific gravity of the two airs and the velocity of the earth's rotation there must be a place between the poles and the equator where the superior atmosphere of inflammable gas would terminate which would account for these streams of the aurora borealis not appearing near the equator add to this that it is probable the electric fluid may be heavier than the magnetic one and will thence by the rotation of the earth's surface ascend over the magnetic one by its centrifugal force and may thus be induced to rise through the thin stratum of aerial atmosphere over the poles See note on Canto II l I shall have occasion again to mention this great accumulation of inflammable air over the poles and to conjecture that these northern lights may be produced by the union of inflammable with common air without the assistance of the electric spark to throw them into combustion  The antiquity of the appearance of northern lights has been doubted as none were recorded in our annals since the remarkable one on Nov till another remarkable one on March and the three following nights which were seen at the same time in Ireland Russia and Poland extending near degrees of longitude and from about the th degree of latitude over almost all the north of Europe There is however reason to believe them of remote antiquity though inaccurately described thus the following curious passage from the Book of Maccabees B II c v is such a description of them as might probably be given by an ignorant and alarmed people  Through all the city for the space of almost forty days there were seen horsemen running in the air in cloth of gold and armed with lances like a band of soldiers and troops of horsemen in array encountering and running one against another with shaking of shields and multitude of pikes and drawing of swords and casting of darts and glittering of golden ornaments and harness  NOTE IIPRIMARY COLOURS  Cling round the aerial bow with prisms bright  And pleased untwist the sevenfold threads of light  CANTO I l  THE manner in which the rainbow is produced was in some measure understood before Sir Isaac Newton had discovered his theory of colours The first person who expressly shewed the rainbow to be formed by the reflection of the sunbeams from drops of falling rain was Antonio de Dominis This was afterwards more fully and distinctly explained by Des Cartes But what caused the diversity of its colours was not then understood it was reserved for the immortal Newton to discover that the rays of light consisted of seven combined colours of different refrangibility which could be seperated at pleasure by a wedge of glass Pemberton's View of Newton  Sir Isaac Newton discovered that the prismatic spectrum was composed of seven colours in the following proportions violet indigo blue green yellow orange red If all these colours be painted on a circular card in the proportions above mentioned and the card be rapidly whirled on its center they produce in the eye the sensation of white And any one of these colours may be imitated by painting a card with the two colours which are contiguous to it in the same proportions as in the spectrum and whirling them in the same manner  My ingenious friend Mr Galton of Birmingham ascertained in this manner by a set of experiments the following propositions the truth of which he had preconceived from the above data  Any colour in the prismatic spectrum may be imitated by a mixture of the two colours contiguous to it  If any three successive colours in the prismatic spectrum are mixed they compose only the second or middlemost colour  If any four successive colours in the prismatic spectrum be mixed a tint similar to a mixture of the second and third colours will be produced but not precisely the same because they are not in the same proportion  If beginning with any colour in the circular spectrum you take of the second colour a quantity equal to the first second and third and add to that the fifth colour equal in quantity to the fourth fifth and sixth and with these combine the seventh colour in the proportion it exists in the spectrum white will be produced Because the first second and third compose only the second and the fourth fifth and sixth compose only the fifth therefore if the seventh be added the same effect is produced as if all the seven were employed  Beginning with any colour in the circular spectrum if you take a tint composed of a certain proportion of the second and third equal in quantity to the first second third and fourth and add to this the sixth colour equal in quantity to the fifth sixth and seventh white will be produced  From these curious experiments of Mr Galton many phenomena in the chemical changes of colours may probably become better understood especially if as I suppose the same theory must apply to transmitted colours as to reflected ones Thus it is well known that if the glass of mangonese which is a tint probably composed of violet and indigo be mixed in a certain proportion with the glass of lead which is yellow that the mixture becomes transparent Now from Mr Galton's experiments it appears that in reflected colours such a mixture would produce white that is the same as if all the colours were reflected And therefore in transmitted colours the same circumstances must produce transparency that is the same as if all the colours were transmitted For the particles which constitute the glass of mangonese will transmit red violet indigo and blue and those of the glass of lead will transmit orange yellow and green hence all the primary colours by a mixture of these glasses become transmitted that is the glass becomes transparent  Mr Galton has further observed that five successive prismatic colours may be combined in such proportions as to produce but one colour a circumstance which might be of consequence in the art of painting For if you begin at any part of the circular spectrum above described and take the first second and third colours in the proportions in which they exist in the spectrum these will compose only the second colour equal in quantity to the first second and third add to these the third fourth and fifth in the proportion they exist in the spectrum and these will produce the fourth colour equal in quantity to the third fourth and fifth Consequently this is precisely the same thing as mixing the second and fourth colours only which mixture would only produce the third colour Therefore if you combine the first second fourth and fifth in the proportions in which they exist in the spectrum with double the quantity of the third colour this third colour will be produced It is probable that many of the unexpected changes in mixing colours on a painter's easle as well as in more fluid chemical mixtures may depend on these principles rather than on a new arrangement or combination of their minute particles  Mr Galton further observes that white may universally be produced by the combination of one prismatic colour and a tint intermediate to two others Which tint may be distinguished by a name compounded of the two colours to which it is intermediate Thus white is produced by a mixture of red with bluegreen Of orange with indigoblue Of Yellow with violetindigo Of green with redviolet Of blue with Orangered Of indigo with yelloworange Of violet with greenyellow Which he further remarks exactly coincides with the theory and facts mentioned by Dr Robert Darwin of Shrewsbury in his account of ocular spectra who has shewn that when one of these contrasted colours has been long viewed a spectrum or appearance of the other becomes visible in the fatigued eye Philos Trans Vol LXXVI for the year  These experiments of Mr Galton might much assist the copperplate printers of callicoes and papers in colours as three colours or more might be produced by two copperplates Thus suppose some yellow figures were put on by the first plate and upon some parts of these yellow figures and on other parts of the ground blue was laid on by another copperplate The three colours of yellow blue and green might be produced as green leaves with yellow and blue flowers  NOTE IIICOLOURED CLOUDS  Eve's silken couch with gorgeous tints adorn  Or fire the arrowy throne of rising morn  CANTO I l  THE rays from the rising and setting sun are refracted by our spherical atmosphere hence the most refrangible rays as the violet indigo and blue are reflected in greater quantities from the morning and evening skies and the least refrangible ones as red and orange are last seen about the setting sun Hence Mr Beguelin observed that the shadow of his finger on his pocketbook was much bluer in the morning and evening when the shadow was about eight times as long as the body from which it was projected Mr Melville observes that the blue rays being more refrangible are bent down in the evenings by our atmosphere while the red and orange being less refrangible continue to pass on and tinge the morning and evening clouds with their colours See Priestley's History of Light and Colours p But as the particles of air like those of water are themselves blue a blue shadow may be seen at all times of the day though much more beautifully in the mornings and evenings or by means of a candle in the middle of the day For if a shadow on a piece of white paper is produced by placing your finger between the paper and a candle in the day light the shadow will appear very blue the yellow light of the candle upon the other parts of the paper apparently deepens the blue by its contrast these colours being opposite to each other as explained in note II  Colours are produced from clouds or mists by refraction as well as by reflection In riding in the night over an unequal country I observed a very beautiful coloured halo round the moon whenever I was covered with a few feet of mist as I ascended from the vallies which ceased to appear when I rose above the mist This I suppose was owing to the thinness of the stratum of mist in which I was immersed had it been thicker the colours refracted by the small drops of which a fog consists would not have passed through it down to my eye  There is a bright spot seen on the cornea of the eye when we face a window which is much attended to by portrait painters this is the light reflected from the spherical surface of the polished cornea and brought to a focus if the observer is placed in this focus he sees the image of the window if he is placed before or behind the focus he only sees a luminous spot which is more luminous and of less extent the nearer he approaches to the focus The luminous appearance of the eyes of animals in the dusky corners of a room or in holes in the earth may arise in some instances from the same principle viz the reflection of the light from the spherical cornea which will be coloured red or blue in some degree by the morning evening or meridian light or by the objects from which that light is previously reflected In the cavern at Colebrook Dale where the mineral tar exsudes the eyes of the horse which was drawing a cart from within  towards the mouth of it appeared like two balls of phosphorus when he was above yards off and for a long time before any other part of the animal was visible In this case I suspect the luminous appearance to have been owing to the light which had entered the eye being reflected from the back surface of the vitreous humour and thence emerging again in parallel rays from the animals eye as it does from the back surface of the drops of the rainbow and from the waterdrops which lie perhaps without contact on cabbage leaves and have the brilliancy of quicksilver This accounts for this luminous appearance being best seen in those animals which have large apertures in their iris as in cats and horses and is the only part visible in obscure places because this is a better reflecting surface than any other part of the animal If any of these emergent rays from the animals eye can be supposed to have been reflected from the choroid coat through the semitransparent retina this would account for the coloured glare of the eyes of dogs or cats and rabits in dark corners  NOTE IVCOMETS  Alarm with cometblaze the sapphire plain  The wan stars glimmering through its silver train  CANTO I l  THERE have been many theories invented to account for the tails of comets Sir Isaac Newton thinks that they consist of rare vapours raised from the nucleus of the comet and so rarefied by the sun's heat as to have their general gravitation diminished and that they in consequence ascend opposite to the sun and from thence reflect the rays of light Dr Halley compares the light of the tails of comets to the streams of the aurora berealis and other electric effluvia Philos Trans No  Dr Hamilton observes that the light of small stars are seen undiminished through both the light of the tails of comets and of the aurora borealis and has further illustrated their electric analogy and adds that the tails of comets consist of a lucid selfshining substance which has not the power of refracting or reflecting the rays of light Essays  The tail of the comet of at one time appeared to extend above degrees from its body and must have thence been above twenty three millions of miles long And the comet of according to the calculations of Dr Halley on November the th was not above one semidiameter of the earth or less than miles to the northward of the way of the earth at which time had the earth been in that part of its orbit what might have been the consequence no one would probably have survived to have registered the tremendous effects  The comet of and having returned in the year according to Dr Halley's prediction in the Philos Trans for there seems no reason to doubt that all the other comets will return after their proper periods Astronomers have in general acquiesced in the conjecture of Dr Halley that the comets of and are one and the same comet from the similarity of the elements of their orbits and were therefore induced to expect its return to its perihelium As this comet is liable to be disturbed in its ascent from the sun by the planets Jupiter and Saturn Dr Maskelyne expected its return to its perihelium in the beginning of the year or the latter end of the year and certainly sometime before the th of April which prediction has not been fulfilled Phil Trans Vol LXXVI  NOTE VSUN'S RAYS  Or give the sun's phlogistic orb to roll  CANTO I l  THE dispute among philosophers about phlogiston is not concerning the existence of an inflammable principle but rather whether there be one or more inflammable principles The disciples of Stahl which till lately included the whole chemical world believed in the identity of phlogiston in all bodies which would flame or calcine The disciples of Lavoisier pay homage to a plurality of phlogistons under the various names of charcoal sulphur metals c Whatever will unite with  pure  air and thence compose an acid is esteemed in this ingenious theory to be a different kind of phlogistic or inflammable body At the same time there remains a doubt whether these inflammable bodies as metals sulphur charcoal c may not be compounded of the same phlogiston along with some other material yet undiscovered and thus an unity of phlogiston exist as in the theory of Stahl though very differently applied in the explication of chemical phenomena  Some modern philosophers are of opinion that the sun is the great fountain from which the earth and other planets derive all the phlogiston which they posses and that this is formed by the combination of the solar rays with all opake bodies but particularly with the leaves of vegetables which they suppose to be organs adapted to absorb them And that as animals receive their nourishment from vegetables they also obtain in a secondary manner their phlogiston from the sun And lastly as great masses of the mineral kingdom which have been found in the thin crust of the earth which human labour has penetrated have evidently been formed from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies these also are supposed thus to have derived their phlogiston from the sun  Another opinion concerning the sun's rays is that they are not luminous till they arrive at our atmosphere and that there uniting with some part of the air they produce  combustion and light is emitted and that an etherial acid yet undiscovered is formed from this combustion  The more probable opinion is perhaps that the sun is a phlogistic mass of matter whose surface is in a state of combustion which like other burning bodies emits light with immense velocity in all directions that these rays of light act upon all opake bodies and combining with them either displace or produce their elementary heat and become chemically combined with the phlogistic part of them for light is given out when phlogistic bodies unite with the oxygenous principle of the air as in combustion or in the reduction of metallic calxes thus in presenting to the flame of a candle a letterwafer if it be coloured with redlead at the time the redlead becomes a metallic drop a flash of light is perceived Dr Alexander Wilson very ingeniously endeavours to prove that the sun is only in a state of combustion on its surface and that the dark spots seen on the disk are excavations or caverns through the luminous crust some of which are miles in diameter Phil Trans Of this I shall have occasion to speak again  NOTE VICENTRAL FIRES  Round her still centre tread the burning soil  And watch the billowy Lavas as they boil  CANTO I  M DE MAIRAN in a paper published in the Histoire de l'Academic de Sciences has endeavoured to shew that the earth receives but a small part of the heat which it possesses from the sun's rays but is principally heated by fires within itself He thinks the sun is the cause of the vicissitudes of our seasons of summer and winter by a very small quantity of heat in addition to that already residing in the earth which by emanations from the centre to the circumference renders the surface habitable and without which though the sun was constantly to illuminate two thirds of the globe at once with a heat equal to that at the equator it would soon become a mass of solid ice His reasonings and calculations on this subject are too long and too intricate to be inserted here but are equally curious and ingenious and carry much conviction along with them  The opinion that the center of the earth consists of a large mass of burning lava has been espoused by Boyle Boerhave and many other philosophers Some of whom considering its supposed effects on vegetation and the formation of minerals have called it a second sun There are many arguments in support of this opinion Because the power of the sun does not extend much beyond ten feet deep into the earth all below being in winter and summer always of the same degree of heat viz which being  much warmer than the mildest frost is supposed to be sustained by some internal distant fire Add to this however that from experiments made some years ago by Dr Franklin the springwater at Philadelphia appeared to be of ° of heat which seems further to confirm this opinion since the climates in North America are supposed to be colder than those of Europe under similar degrees of latitude Mr De Luc in going feet perpendicular into the mines of Hartz on July the th on a very fine day found the air at the bottom a little warmer than at the top of the shaft Phil Trans Vol LXIX p In the mines in Hungary which are cubits deep the heat becomes very troublesome when the miners get below feet depth  Morinus de Locis subter  p But as some other deep mines as mentioned by Mr Kirwan are said to possess but the common heat of the earth and as the crust of the globe thus penetrated by human labour is so thin compared with the whole no certain deduction can be made from these facts on either side of the question The warmsprings in many parts of the earth at great distance from any Volcanos seem to originate from the condensation of vapours arising from water which is boiled by subterraneous fires and cooled again in their passage through a certain length of the colder soil for the theory of chemical solution will not explain the equality of their heat at all seasons and through so many centuries See note on Fucus in Vol II See a letter on this subject in Mr Pilkinton's View of Derbyshire from Dr Darwin From the situations of volcanos which are always found upon the summit of the highest mountains For as these mountains have been lifted up and lose several of their uppermost strata as they rise the lowest strata of the earth yet known appear at the tops of the highest hills and the beds of the Volcanos upon these hills must in consequence belong to the lowest strata of the earth consisting perhaps of granite or basaltes which were produced before the existance of animal or vegetable bodies and might constitute the original nucleus of the earth which I have supposed to have been projected from the sun hence the volcanos themselves appear to be spiracula or chimneys belonging to great central fires It is probably owing to the escape of the elastic vapours from these spiracula that the modern earthquakes are of such small extent compared with those of remote antiquity of which the vestiges remain all over the globe The great size and height of the continents and the great size and depth of the Southsea Atlantic and other oceans evince that the first earthquakes which produced these immense changes in the globe must have been occasioned by central fires The very distant and expeditious communication of the shocks of some great earthquakes The earthquake at Lisbon in was perceived in Scotland in the Peak of Derbyshire and in many other distant parts of Europe The percussions of it travelled with about the velocity of sound viz about thirteen miles in a minute The earthquake in extended leagues Goldsmith's History These phenomena are easily explained if the central parts of the earth consist of a fluid lava as a percussion on one part of such a fluid mass would be felt on other parts of its confining vault like a stroke on a fluid contained in a bladder which however gentle on one side is perceptible to the hand placed on the other and the velocity with which such a concussion would travel would be that of sound or thirteen miles in a minute For further information on this part of the subject the reader is referred to Mr Michell's excellent Treatise on Earthquakes in the  Philos Trans Vol LI That there is a cavity at the center of the earth is made probable by the late experiments on the attraction of mountains by Mr Maskerlyne who supposed from other considerations that the density of the earth near the surface should be five times less than its mean density Phil Trans Vol LXV p But found from the attraction of the mountain Schehallien that it is probable the mean density of the earth is but double that of the hill Ibid p Hence if the first supposition be well founded there would appear to be a cavity at the centre of considerable magnitude from whence the immense beds and mountains of lava toadstone basaltes granite c have been protruded The variation of the compass can only be accounted for by supposing the central parts of the earth to consist of a fluid mass and that part of this fluid is iron which requiring a greater degree of heat to bring it into fusion than glass or other metals remains a solid and the vis inertiae of this fluid mass with the iron in it occasions it to perform sewer revolutions than the crust of solid earth over it and thus it is gradually left behind and the place where the floating iron resides is pointed to by the direct or retrograde motions of the magnetic needle This seems to have been nearly the opinion of Dr Halley and Mr Euler  NOTE VIIELEMENTARY HEAT  Or sphere on sphere in widening waves expand  And glad with genial warmth the incumbent land  CANTO I l  A CERTAIN quantity of heat seems to be combined with all bodies besides the sensible quantity which gravitates like the electric fluid amongst them This combined heat or latent heat of Dr Black when set at liberty by fermentation inflammation crystallization freezing or other chemical attractions producing new  combinations  passes as a fluid element into the surrounding bodies And by thawing diffusion of neutral salts in water melting and other chemical solutions a portion of heat is attracted from the bodies in vicinity and enters into or becomes combined with the new solutions  Hence a combination of metals with acids of essential oils and acids of alcohol and water of acids and water give out heat whilst a  solution  of snow in water or in acids and of neutral salts in water attract heat from the surrounding bodies So the acid of nitre mixed with oil of cloves unites with it and produces a most violent flame the same acid of nitre poured on snow instantly dissolves it and produces the greatest degree of cold yet known by which at Petersburgh quicksilver was first frozen in  Water may be cooled below ° without being frozen if it be placed on a solid floor and secured from agitation but when thus cooled below the freezing point the least  agitation turns part of it suddenly into ice and when this sudden freezing takes place a thermometer placed in it instantly rises as some heat is given out in the act of congelation and the ice is thus left with the same  sensible  degree of cold as the water had possessed before it was agitated but is nevertheless now combined with less  latent  heat  A cubic inch of water thus cooled down to ° mixed with an equal quantity of boiling water at ° will cool it to the middle number between these two or to But a cubit inch of ice whose sensible cold also is but mixed with an equal quantity of boiling water will cool it six times as much as the cubic inch of cold water abovementioned as the ice not only gains its share of the sensible or gravitating heat of the boiling water but attracts to itself also and combines with the quantity of latent heat which it had lost at the time of its congelation  So boiling water will acquire but ° of heat under the common pressure of the atmosphere but the steam raised from it by its expansion or by its solution in the atmosphere combines with and carries away a prodigious quantity of heat which it again parts with on its condensation as is seen in common distillation where the large quantity of water in the wormtub is so soon heated Hence the evaporation of ether on a thermometer soon sinks the mercury below freezing and hence a warmth of the air in winter frequently succeeds a shower  When the matter of heat or calorique is set at liberty from its combinations as by inflammation it passes into the surrounding bodies which possess different capacities of acquiring their share of the loose or sensible heat thus a pint measure of cold water at ° mixed with a pint of boiling water at ° will cool it to the degree between these two numbers or to ° but it requires two pint measures of quicksilver at ° of heat to cool one pint of water as above These and other curious experiments are adduced by Dr Black to evince the existance of combined or latent heat in bodies as has been explained by some of his pupils and well illustrated by Dr Crawford The world has long been in expectation of an account of his discoveries on this subject by the celebrated author himself  As this doctrine of elementary heat in its fluid and combined state is not yet universally received I shall here add two arguments in support of it drawn from different sources viz from the heat given out or absorbed by the mechanical condensation or expansion of the air and perhaps of other bodies and from the analogy of the various phenomena of heat with those of electricity  I If a thermometer be placed in the receiver of an airpump and the air hastily exhausted the thermometer will sink some degrees and the glass become steamy the same occurs in hastily admitting a part of the air again This I suppose to be produced by the expansion of part of the air both during the exhaustion and readmission of it and that the air so expanded becomes capable of attracting from the bodies in its vicinity a part of their heat hence the vapours contained in it and the glass receiver are for a time colder and the steam is precipitated That the air thus parts with its moisture from the cold occasioned by its rarefaction and not simply by the rarefaction itself is evident because in a minute or two the same rarefied air will again take up the dew deposited on the receiver and because water will evaporate sooner in rare than in dense air  There is a curious phenomenon similar to this observed in the fountain of Hiero constructed on a large scale at the Chemnicensian mines in Hungary In this machine the air in a large vessel is compressed by a column of water feet high a stopcock is then opened and as the air issues out with great vehemence and thus becomes immediately greatly expanded so much cold is produced that the moisture from this stream of air is precipitated in the form of snow and ice is formed adhering to the nosel of the cock This remarkable circumstance is described at large with a plate of the machine in Philos Trans Vol LII for  The following experiment is related by Dr Darwin in the Philos Trans Vol LXXVIII Having charged an airgun as forcibly as he well could the aircell and syringe became exceedingly hot much more so than could be ascribed to the friction in working it it was then left about half an hour to cool down to the temperature of the air and a thermometer having been previously fixed against a wall the air was discharged in a continual stream on its bulb and it sunk many degrees From these three experiments of the steam in the exhaustéd receiver being deposited and reabsorbed when a part of the air is exhausted or readmitted and the snow produced by the fountain of Hiero and the extraordinary heat given out in charging and the cold produced in discharging an airgun there is reason to conclude that when air is mechanically compressed the elementary fluid heat is pressed out of it and that when it is mechanically expanded the same fluid heat is reabsorbed from the common mass  It is probable all other bodies as well as air attract heat from their neighbours when they are mechanically expanded and give it out when they are mechanically condensed Thus when a vibration of the particles of hard bodies is excited by friction or by percussion these particles mutually recede from and approach each other reciprocally at the times of their recession from each other the body becomes enlarged in bulk and is then in a condition to attract heat from those in its vicinity with great and sudden power at the times of their approach to each other this heat is again given out but the bodies in contact having in the mean while received the heat they had thus lost from other bodies behind them do not so suddenly or so forcibly reabsorb the heat again from the body in vibration hence it remains on its surface like the electric fluid on a rubbed glass globe and for the same reason because there is no good conductor to take it up again Hence at every vibration more and more heat is acquired and stands loose upon the surface as in filing metals or rubbing glass tubes and thus a smith with a few strokes on a nail on his anvil can make it hot enough to light a brimstonematch and hence in striking flint and steel together heat enough is produced to vitrify the parts thus strucken off the quantity of which heat is again probably increased by the new chemical combination  II The analogy between the phenomena of the electric fluid and of heat furnishes another argument in support of the existence of heat as a gravitating fluid They are both accumulated by friction on the excited body They are propagated easily or with difficalty along the same classes of bodies with ease by metals with less ease by water and with difficulty by resins beeswax silk air and glass Thus glass canes or canes of sealingwax may be melted by a blowpipe or a candle within a quarter of an  inch of the fingers which hold them without any inconvenient heat while a pin or other metallic substance applyed to the flame of a candle so readily conducts the heat as immediately to burn the fingers Hence clothes of silk keep the body warmer than clothes of linen of equal thickness by confining the heat upon the body And hence plains are so much warmer than the summits of mountains by the greater density of the air confining the acquired heat upon them They both give out light in their passage through air perhaps not in their passage through a vacuum They both of them fuse or vitrify metals Bodies after being electrized if they are mechanically extended will receive a greater quantity of electricity as in Dr Franklin's experiment of the chain in the tankard the same seems true in respect to heat as explained above Both heat and electricity contribute to suspend steam in the atmosphere by producing or increasing the repulsion of its particles They both gravitate when they have been accumulated till they find their equilibrium  If we add to the above the many chemical experiments which receive an easy and elegant explanation from the supposed matter of heat as employed in the works of Bergman and Lavoisier I think we may reasonably allow of its existence as an element occasionally combined with other bodies and occasionally existing as a fluid like the electric fluid gravitating amongst them and that hence it may be propagated from the central fires of the earth to the whole mass and contribute to preserve the mean heat of the earth which in this country is about degrees but variable from the greater or less effect of the sun's heat in different climates so well explained in Mr Kirwan's Treatise on the Temperature of different Latitudes Elmsly London  NOTE VIIIMEMNON'S LYRE  So to the sacred Sun in Memnon's fane  Spontaneous concords quired the matin strain  CANTO I l  THE gigantic statue of Memnon in his temple at Thebes had a lyre in his hands which many credible writers assure us sounded when the rising sun shone upon it Some philosophers have supposed that the sun's light possesses a mechanical impulse and that the sounds abovementioned might be thence produced Mr Michell constructed a very tender horizontal balance as related by Dr Priestley in his history of light and colours for this purpose but some experiments with this balance which I saw made by the late Dr Powel who threw the focus of a large reflector on one extremity of it were not conclusive eitherway as the copper leaf of the balance approached in one experiment and receded in another  There are however methods by which either a rotative or alternating motion may be produced by very moderate degrees of heat If a straight glass tube such as are used for barometers be suspended horizontally before a fire like a roasting spit it will revolve by intervals for as glass is a bad conductor of heat the side next the fire becomes heated sooner than the opposite side and the tube becomes bent into a bow with the external part of the curve towards the fire this curve then falls down and produces a fourth part of a revolution of the glass tube which thus revolves with intermediate pauses  Another alternating motion I have seen produced by suspending a glass tube about eight inches long with bulbs at each end on a centre like a scale beam This curious machine is filled about one third part with purest spirit of wine the other two thirds being a vacuum and is called a pulseglass if it be placed in a box before the fire so that either bulb as it rises may become shaded from the fire and exposed to it when it descends an alternate libration of it is produced For spirit of wine in vacuo emits steam by a very small degree of heat and this steam forces the spirit beneath it up into the upper bulb which therefore descends It is probable such a machine on a larger scale might be of use to open the doors or windows of hothouses or mellonframes when the air within them should become too much heated or might be employed in more important mechanical purposes  On travelling through a hot summer's day in a chaise with a box covered with leather on the foreaxletree I observed as the sun shone upon the black leather the box began to open its lid which at noon rose above a foot and could not without great force be pressed down and which gradually closed again as the sun declined in the evening This I suppose might with still greater facility be applied to the purpose of opening melonframes or the sashes of hothouses  The statue of Memnon was overthrown and sawed in two by Cambyses to discover its internal structure and is said still to exist See Savary's Letters on Egypt The truncated statue is said for many centuries to have saluted the rising sun with chearful tones and the setting sun with melancholy ones  NOTE IXLUMINOUS INSECTS  Star of the earth and diamond of the night  CANTO I l  THERE are eighteen species of Lampyris or glowworm according to Linneus some of which are found in almost every part of the world In many of the species the females have no wings and are supposed to be discovered by the winged males by their shining in the night They become much more lucid when they put themselves in motion which would seem to indicate that their light is owing to their respiration in which process it is probable phosphoric acid is produced by the combination of vital air with some part of the blood and that light is given out through their transparent bodies by this slow internal combustion  There is a firefly of the beetlekind described in the Dict Raisonné under the name of Acudia which is said to be two inches long and inhabits the WestIndies and South America the natives use them instead of candles putting from one to three of them under a glass Madam Merian says that at Surinam the light of this fly is so great that she saw sufficiently well by one of them to paint and finish one of the figures of them in her work on insects The largest and oldest of them are said to become four inches long and to shine like a shooting star as they fly and are thence called Lanternbearers The use of this light to the insect itself seems to be that it may not fly against objects in the night by which contrivance these insects are enabled to procure their sustenance either by night or day as their wants may require or their numerous enemies permit them whereas some of our beetles have eyes adapted only to the night and if they happen to come abroad too soon in the evening are so dazzled that they fly against every thing in their way See note on Phosphorus No X  In some seas as particularly about the coast of Malabar as a ship floats along it seems during the night to be surrounded with fire and to leave a long tract of light behind it Whenever the sea is gently agitated it seems converted into little stars every drop as it breaks emits light like bodies electrified in the dark Mr Bomare says that when he was at the port of Cettes in Languedoc and bathing with a companion in the sea after a very hot day they both appeared covered with fire after every immersion and that laying his wet hand on the arm of his companion who had not then dipped himself the exact mark of his hand and fingers was seen in characters of fire As numerous microscopic insects are found in this shining water its light has been generally ascribed to them though it seems probable that fishslime in hot countries may become in such a state of incipient putrefaction as to give light especially when by agitation it is more exposed to the air otherwise it is not easy to explain why agitation should be necessary to produce this marine light See note on Phosphorus No X  NOTE XPHOSPHORUS  Or mark in shining letters Kunckel's name  In the pale phosphor's selfconsuming flame  CANTO I l  KUNCKEL a native of Hamburgh was the first who discovered to the world the process for producing phosphorus though Brandt and Boyle were likewise said to have previously had the art of making it It was obtained from sal microcosmicum by evaporation in the form of an acid but has since been found in other animal substances as in the ashes of bones and even in some vegetables as in wheat flour Keir's chemical Dict This phosphoric acid is like all other acids united with vital air and requires to be treated with charcoal or phlogiston to deprive it of this air it then becomes a kind of animal sulphur but of so inflammable a nature that on the access of air it takes fire spontaneously and as it burns becomes again united with vital air and reassumes its form of phosphoric acid  As animal respiration seems to be a kind of slow combustion in which it is probable that pbosphoric acid is produced by the union of phosphorus with the vital air so it is also probable that phosphoric acid is produced in the excretory or respiratory vessels of luminous insects as the glowworm and firefly and some marine insects From the same principle I suppose the light from putrid fish as from the heads of hadocks and from putrid veal and from rotten wood in a certain state of their putrefaction is produced and phosphorus thus slowly combined with air is changed into phosphoric acid The light from the Bolognian stone and from calcined shells and from white paper and linen after having been exposed for a time to the sun's light seem to produce either the phosphoric or some other kind of acid from the sulphurous or phlogistic matter which they contain See note on Beccari's shells l  There is another process seems similar to this slow combustion and that is  bleaching  By the warmth and light of the sun the water sprinkled upon linen or cotton cloth seems to be decomposed if we credit the theory of M Lavoisier and a part of the vital air thus set at liberty and uncombined and not being in its elastic form more easily dissolves the colouring or phlogistic matter of the cloth and produces a new acid which is itself colourless or is washed out of the cloth by water The new process of bleaching confirms a part of this theory for by uniting much vital air to marine acid by distilling it from manganese on dipping the cloth to be bleached in water repleat with this superaerated marine acid the colouring matter disappears immediately sooner indeed in cotton than in linen See note XXXIV  There is another process which I suspect bears analogy to these abovementioned and that is the rancidity of animal fat as of bacon if bacon be hung up in a warm kitchen with much salt adhering on the outside of it the fat part of it soon becomes  yellow and rancid if it be washed with much cold water after it has imbibed the salt and just before it is hung up I am well informed that it will not become rancid or in very slight degrees In the former case I imagine the salt on the surface of the bacon attracts water during the cold of the night which is evaporated during the day and that in this evaporation a part of the water becomes decomposed as in bleaching and its vital air uniting with greater facility in its unelastic state with the animal fat produces an acid perhaps of the phosphoric kind which being of a fixed nature lies upon the bacon giving it the yellow colour and rancid taste It is remarkable that the superaerated marine acid does not bleach living animal substances at least it did not whiten a part of my hand which I for some minutes exposed to it  NOTE XISTEAMENGINE  Quick moves the balanced beam of giantbirth  Wields his large limbs and nodding shakes the earth  CANTO I l  THE expansive force of steam was known in some degree to the antients Hero of Alexandria describes an application of it to produce a rotative motion by the reaction of steam issuing from a sphere mounted upon an axis through two small tubes bent into tangents and issuing from the opposite sides of the equatorial diameter of the sphere the sphere was supplied with steam by a pipe communicating with a pan of boiling water and entering the sphere at one of its poles  A french writer about the year describes a method of raising water to the upper part of a house by filling a chamber with steam and suffering it to condense of itself but it seems to have been mere theory as his method was scarcely practicable as he describes it In the Marquis of Worcester mentions a method of raising water by fire in his Century of Inventions but he seems only to have availed himself of the expansive force and not to have known the advantages arising from condensing the steam by an injection of cold water This latter and most important improvement seems to have been made by Capt Savery sometime prior to for in that year his patent for the use of that invention was confirmed by act of parliament This gentleman appears to have been the first who reduced the machine to practice and exhibited it in an useful form This method consisted only in expelling the air from a vessel by steam and condensing the steam by an injection of cold water which making a vacuum the pressure of the atmosphere forced the water to ascend into the steamvessel through a pipe of to feet  high and by the admission of dense steam from the boiler forcing the water in the steamvessel to ascend to the height desired This construction was defective because it required very strong vessels to resist the force of the steam and because an enormous quantity of steam was condensed by coming in contact with the cold water in the steamvessel  About or soon after that time M Papin attempted a steamengine on similar principles but rather more defective in its construction  The next improvement was made very soon afterwards by Messrs Newcomen and Cawley of Dartmouth it consisted in employing for the steamvessel a hollow cylinder shut at bottom and open at top furnished with a piston sliding easily up and down in it and made tight by oakum or hemp and covered with water This piston is suspended by chains from one end of a beam moveable upon an axis in the middle of its length to the other end of this beam are suspended the pumprods  The danger of bursting the vessels was avoided in this machine as however high the water was to be raised it was not necessary to increase the density of the steam but only to enlarge the diameter of the cylinder  Another advantage was that the cylinder not being made so cold as in Savary's method much less steam was lost in filling it after each condensation  The machine however still remained imperfect for the cold water thrown into the cylinder acquired heat from the steam it condensed and being in a vessel exhausted of air it produced steam itself which in part resisted the action of the atmosphere on the piston were this remedied by throwing in more cold water the destruction of steam in the next filling of the cylinder would be proportionally increased It has therefore in practice been found adviseable not to load these engines with columns of water weighing more than seven pounds for each square inch of the area of the piston The bulk of water when converted into steam remained unknown until Mr J Watt then of Glasgow in determined it to be about times more rare than water It soon occurred to Mr Watt that a perfect engine would be that in which no steam should be condensed in filling the cylinder and in which the steam should be so perfectly cooled as to produce nearly a perfect vacuum  Mr Watt having ascertained the degree of heat in which water boiled in vacuo and under progressive degrees of pressure and instructed by Dr Black's discovery of latent heat having calculated the quantity of cold water necessary to condense certain quantities of steam so far as to produce the exhaustion required he made a communication from the cylinder to a cold vessel previously exhausted of air and water into which the steam rushed by its elasticity and became immediately condensed He then adapted a cover to the cylinder and admitted steam above the piston to press it down instead of air and instead of applying water he used oil or grease to fill the pores of the oakum and to lubricate the cylinder  He next applied a pump to extract the injection water the condensed steam and the air from the condensing vessel every stroke of the engine  To prevent the cooling of the cylinder by the contact of the external air he surrounded it with a case containing steam which he again protected by a covering of matters which conduct heat slowly  This construction presented an easy means of regulating the power of the engine for the steam being the acting power as the pipe which admits it from the boiler is more or less opened a greater or smaller quantity can enter during the time of a stroke and consequently the engine can act with exactly the necessary degree of energy  Mr Watt gained a patent for his engine in but the further persecution of his designs were delayed by other avocations till when in conjunction with Mr Boulton of Soho near Birmingham numerous experiments were made on a large scale by their united ingenuity and great improvements added to the machinery and an act of parliament obtained for the prolongation of their patent for twentyfive years they have since that time drained many of the deep mines in Cornwall which but for the happy union of such genius must immediately have ceased to work One of these engines works a pump of eighteen inches diameter and upwards of fathom or feet high at the rate of ten to twelve strokes of seven feet long each in a minute and that with one fifth part of the coals which a common engine would have taken to do the same work The power of this engine may be easier comprehended by saying that it raised a weight equal to pounds feet high in a minute which is equal to the combined action of good horses In Newcomen's engine this would have required a cylinder of the enormous diameter of inches or ten feet but as in this engine of Mr Watt and Mr Boulton the steam acts and a vacuum is made alternately above and below the piston the power exerted is double to what the same cylinder would otherways produce and is further augmented by an inequality in the length of the two ends of the lever  These gentlemen have also by other contrivances applied their engines to the turning of mills for almost every purpose of which that great pile of machinery the Albion Mill is a well known instance Forges slitting mills and other great works are erected where nature has furnished no running water and future times may boast that this grand and useful engine was invented and perfected in our own country  Since the above article went to the press the Albion Mill is no more it is supposed to have been set on fire by interested or malicious incendaries and is burnt to the ground Whence London has lost the credit and the advantage of possessing the most powerful machine in the world  NOTE XIIFROST  In phalanx firm the fiend of Frost assail  CANTO I l  THE cause of the expansion of water during its conversion into ice is not yet well ascertained it was supposed to have been owing to the air being set at liberty in the act of congelation which was before dissolved in the water and the many air bubbles in ice were thought to countenance this opinion But the great force with which ice expands during its congelation so as to burst iron bombs and coehorns according to the experiments of Major Williams at Quebec invalidates this idea of the cause of it and may sometime be brought into use as a means of breaking rocks in mining or projecting cannonballs or for other mechanical purposes if the means of producing congelation should ever be discovered to be as easy as the means of producing combustion  Mr de Mairan attributes the increase of bulk of frozen water to the different arrangement of the particles of it in crystallization as they are constantly joined at an angle of degrees and must by this disposition he thinks occupy a greater volume than if they were parallel He found the augmentation of the water during freezing to amount to onefourteenth oneeighteenth onenineteenth and when the water was previously purged of air to only onetwentysecond part He adds that a piece of ice which was at first only onefourteenth part specifically lighter than water on being exposed some days to the frost became onetwelfth lighter than water Hence he thinks ice by being exposed to greater cold still increases in volume and to this attributes the bursting of ice in ponds and on the glaciers See Lewis's Commerce of Arts p and the note on Muschus in the other volume of this work  This expansion of ice well accounts for the greater mischief done by vernal frosts attended with moisture as by hoarfrosts than by the dry frosts called black frosts Mr Lawrence in a letter to Mr Bradley complains that the dalemist attended with a frost on mayday had destroyed all his tender fruits though there was a sharper frost the night before without a mist that did him no injury and adds that a garden not a stone's throw from his own on a higher situation being above the dalemist had received no damage Bradley Vol II p  Mr Hunter by very curious experiments discovered that the living principle in fish in vegetables and even in eggs and seeds possesses a power of resisting congelation Phil Trans There can be no doubt but that the exertions of animals to avoid the pain of cold may produce in them a greater quantity of heat at least for a time but that vegetables eggs or seeds should possess such a quality is truly wonderful Others have imagined that animals possess a power of preventing themselves from becoming much warmer than degrees of heat when immersed in an atmosphere above that degree of heat It is true that the increased exhalation from their bodies will in some measure cool them as much heat is carried off by the evaporation of fluids but this is a chemical not an animal process The experiments made by those who continued  many minutes in the air of a room heated so much above any natural atmospheric heat do not seem conclusive as they remained in it a less time than would have been necessary to have heated a mass of beef of the same magnitude and the circulation of the blood in living animals by perpetually bringing new supplies of fluid to the skin would prevent the external surface from becoming hot much sooner than the whole mass And thirdly there appears no power of animal bodies to produce cold in diseases as in scarlet fever in which the increased action of the vessels of the skin produces heat and contributes to exhaust the animal power already too much weakened  It has been thought by many that frosts meliorate the ground and that they are in general salubrious to mankind In respect to the former it is now well known that ice or snow contain no nitrous particles and though frost by enlarging the bulk of moist clay leaves it softer for a time after the thaw yet as soon as the water exhales the clay becomes as hard as before being pressed together by the incumbent atmosphere and by its selfattraction called  setting  by the potters Add to this that on the coasts of Africa where frost is unknown the fertility of the soil is almost beyond our conceptions of it In respect to the general salubrity of frosty seasons the bills of mortality are an evidence in the negative as in long frosts many weakly and old people perish from debility occasioned by the cold and many classes of birds and other wild animals are benumbed by the cold or destroyed by the consequent scarcity of food and many tender vegetables perish from the degree of cold  I do not think it should be objected to this doctrine that there are moist days attended with a brisk cold wind when no visible ice appears and which are yet more disagreeable and destructive than frosty weather For on these days the cold moisture which is deposited on the skin is there evaporated and thus produces a degree of cold perhaps greater than the milder frosts Whence even in such days both the disagreeable sensations and insalubrious effects belong to the cause abovementioned viz the intensity of the cold Add to this that in these cold moist days as we pass along or as the wind blows upon us a new sheet of cold water is as it were perpetually applied to us and hangs upon our bodies now as water is times denser than air and is a much better conductor of heat we are starved with cold like those who go into a cold bath both by the great number of particles in contact with the skin and their greater facility of receiving our heat  It may nevertheless be true that snows of long duration in our winters may be less injurious to vegetation than great rains and shorter frosts for two reasons Because great rains carry down many thousand pounds worth of the best part of the manure off the lands into the sea whereas snow dissolves more gradually and thence carries away less from the land any one may distinguish a snowflood from a rainflood by the transparency of the water Hence hills or fields with considerable inclination of surface should be ploughed horizontally that the furrows may stay the water from showers till it deposits its mud Snow protects vegetables from the severity of the frost since it is always in a state of thaw where it is in contact with the earth as the earth's heat is about ° and the heat of thawing snow is ° the vegetables between them are kept in a degree of heat about by which many of them are preserved See note on Muschus Vol II of this work  NOTE XIIIELECTRICITY  Cold from each point cerulean lustres gleam  CANTO I l  ELECTRIC POINTS  THERE was an idle dispute whether knobs or points were preferable on the top of conductors for the defence of houses The design of these conductors is to permit the electric matter accumulated in the clouds to pass through them into the earth in a smaller continued stream as the cloud approaches before it comes to what is termed striking distance now as it is well known that accumulated electricity will pass to points at a much greater distance than it will to knobs there can be no doubt of their preference and it would seem that the finer the point and the less liable to become rusty the better as it would take off the lightening while it was still at a greater distance and by that means preserve a greater extent of building the very extremity of the point should be of pure silver or gold and might be branched into a kind of brush since one small point can not be supposed to receive so great a quantity as a thicker bar might conduct into the earth  If an insulated metallic ball is armed with a point like a needle projecting from one part of it the electric fluid will be seen in the dark to pass off from this point so long as the ball is kept supplied with electricity The reason of this is not difficult to comprehend every part of the electric atmosphere which surrounds the insulated ball is attracted to that ball by a large surface of it whereas the electric atmosphere which is near the extremity of the needle is attracted to it by only a single point in consequence the particles of electric matter near the surface of the ball approach towards it and push off by their greater gravitation the particles of electric matter over the point of the needle in a continued stream  Something like this happens in respect to the diffusion of oil on water from a pointed cork an experiment which was many years ago shewn me by Dr Franklin he cut a piece of cork about the size of a letterwafer and left on one edge of it a point about a sixth of an inch in length projecting as a tangent to the circumference This was dipped in oil and thrown on a pond of water and continued to revolve as the oil left the point for a great many minutes The oil descends from the floating cork upon the water being diffused upon it without friction and perhaps without contact but its going off at the point so forcibly as to make the cork revolve in a contrary direction seems analogous to the departure of the electric fluid from points  Can any thing similar to either of these happen in respect to the earth's atmosphere and give occasion to the breezes on the tops of mountains which may be considered as points on the earths circumference  FAIRYRINGS  There is a phenomenon supposed to be electric which is yet unaccounted for I mean the Fairyrings as they are called so often seen on the grass The numerous flashes of lightning which occur every summer are I believe generally discharged on the earth and but seldom if ever from one cloud to another Moist trees are the most frequent conductors of these flashes of lightning and I am informed by purchasers of wood that innumerable trees are thus cracked and injured At other times larger parts or prominences of clouds gradually sinking as they move along are discharged on the moisture parts of grassy plains Now this knob or corner of a cloud in being attracted by the earth will become nearly cylindrical as loose wool would do when drawn out into a thread and will strike the earth with a stream of electricity perhaps two or ten yards in diameter Now as a stream of electricity displaces the air it passes through it is plain no part of the grass can be burnt by it but just the external ring of this cylinder where the grass can have access to the air since without air nothing can be calcined This earth after having been so calcined becomes a richer soil and either funguses or a bluer grass for many years mark the place That lightning displaces the air in its passage is evinced by the loud crack that succeeds it which is owing to the sides of the aerial vacuum clapping together when the lightning is withdrawn That nothing will calcine without air is now well understood from the acids produced in the burning of phlogistic substances and may be agreeably seen by suspending a paper on an iron prong and putting it into the centre of the blaze of an ironfurnace it may be held there some seconds and may be again withdrawn without its being burnt if it be passed quickly into the flame and out again through the external part of it which is in contact with the air I know some circles of many yards diameter of this kind near Foremark in Derbyshire which annually produce large white funguses and stronger grass and have done so I am informed above thirty years This increased fertility of the ground by calcination or charring and its continuing to operate so many years is well worth the attention of the farmer and shews the use of paring and burning new turf in agriculture which produces its effect not so much by the ashes of the vegetable fibres as by charring the soil which adheres to them  These situations whether from eminence or from moisture which were proper once to attract and discharge a thundercloud are more liable again to experience the same Hence many fairyrings are often seen near each other either without intersecting each other as I saw this summer in a garden in Nottinghamshire or intersecting each other as described on Arthur's seat near Edinburgh in the Edinb Trans Vol II p  NOTE XIVBUDS AND BULBS  Where dwell my vegetative realms benumb'd  In buds imprison'd or in bulbs intomb'd  CANTO I l  A TREE is properly speaking a family or swarm of buds each bud being an individual plant for if one of these buds be torn or cut out and planted in the earth with a glass cup inverted over it to prevent its exhalation from being at first greater than its power of absorption it will produce a tree similar to its parent each bud has a leaf which is its lungs appropriated to it and the bark of the tree is a congeries of the roots of these individual buds whence old hollow trees are often seen to have some branches flourish with vigour after the internal wood is almost intirely decayed and vanished According to this idea Linneus has observed that trees and shrubs are roots above ground for if a tree be inverted leaves will grow from the rootpart and roots from the trunkpart Phil Bot p Hence it appears that vegetables have two methods of propagating themselves the oviparous as by seeds and the viviparous as by their buds and bulbs and that the individual plants whether from seeds or buds or bulbs are all annual productions like many kinds of insects as the silkworm the parent perishing in the autumn after having produced an embryon which lies in a torpid state during the winter and is matured in the succeeding summer Hence Linneus names buds and bulbs the wintercradles of the plant or hybernacula and might have given the same term to seeds In warm climates few plants produce buds as the vegetable life can be compleated in one summer and hence the hybernacle is not wanted in cold climates also some plants do not produce buds as philadelphus srangula viburnum ivy heath woodnightshade rue geranium  The bulbs of plants are another kind of wintercradle or hybernacle adhering to the descending trunk and are found in the perennial herbaceous plants which are too tender to bear the cold of the winter The production of these subterraneous winter lodges is not yet perhaps clearly understood they have been distributed by Linneus according to their forms into scaly solid coated and jointed bulbs which however does not elucidate their manner of production As the buds of trees may be truly esteemed individual annual plants their roots constituting the bark of the tree it follows that these roots viz of each individual bud spread themselves over the last years bark making a new bark over the old one and thence descending cover with a new bark the old roots also in the same manner A similar circumstance I suppose to happen in some herbaceous plants that is a new bark is annually produced over the old root and thus for some years at least the old root or caudex increases in size and puts up new stems As these roots increase in size the central part I suppose changes like the internal wood of a tree and does not possess any vegetable life and therefore gives out no fibres or rootlets and hence appears bitten off as in valerian plantain and devil'sbit And this decay of the central part of the root I suppose has given occasion to the belief of the rootfibres drawing down the bulb so much insisted on by Mr Milne in his Botanical Dictionary Art Bulb  From the observations and drawings of various kinds of bulbous roots at different times of their growth sent me by a young lady of nice observation it appears probable that all bulbous roots properly so called perish annually in this climate Bradley Miller and the Author of Spectacle de la Nature observe that the tulip annually renews its bulb for the stalk of the old flower is found under the old dry coat but on the outside of the new bulb This large new bulb is the flowering bulb but besides this there are other small new bulbs produced between the coats of this large one but from the same caudex or circle from which the rootfibres spring these small bulbs are leafbearing bulbs and renew themselves annually with increasing size till they bear flowers  Missfavoured me with the following curious experiment She took a small tuliproot out of the earth when the green leaves were sufficiently high to show the flower and placed it in a glass of water the leaves and flower soon withered and the bulb became wrinkled and soft but put out one small side bulb and three bulbs beneath descending an inch into the water by long processes from the caudex the old bulb in some weeks intirely decayed on dissecting this monster the middle descending bulb was found by its process to adhere to the caudex and to the old flowerstem and the side ones were separated from the flowerstem by a few shrivelled coats but adhered to the caudex Whence she concludes that these last were offsets or leafbulbs which should have been seen between the coats of the new flowerbulb if it had been left to grow in the earth and that the middle one would have been the new flowerbulb In some years perhaps in wet seasons the florists are said to lose many of their tuliproots by a similar process the new leafbulbs being produced beneath the old ones by an elongation of the caudex without any new flowerbulbs  By repeated dissections she observes that the leafbulbs or offsets of tulip crocus gladiolus fritillary are renewed in the same manner as the floweringbulbs contrary to the opinion of many writers this new leafbulb is formed on the inside of the coats from whence the leaves grow and is more or less advanced in size as the outer coats and leaves are more or less shrivelled In examining tulip iris hyacinth harebell the new bulb was invariably found  between  the flowerstem and the base of the innermost leaf of those roots which had flowered and  inclosed by  the base of the innermost leaf in those roots which had not flowered in both cases adhering to the caudex or fleshy circle from which the rootfibres spring  Hence it is probable that the bulbs of hyacinths are renewed annually but that this is performed from the caudex within the old bulb the outer coat of which does not so shrivel as in crocus and fritillary and hence this change is not so apparent But I believe as soon as the flower is advanced the new bulbs may be seen on dissection nor does the annual increase of the size of the root of cyclamen and of aletris capensis militate against this annual renewal of them since the leafbulbs or offsets as described above are increased in size as they are annually renewed See note on orchis and on anthoxanthum in Vol II of this work  NOTE XVSOLAR VOLCANOS  From the deep craters of his realms of fire  The whirling sun this ponderous planet hurld  CANTO II l  DR ALEXANDER WILSON Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow published a paper in the Philosophical Transactions for demonstrating that the spots in the sun's disk are real cavities excavations through the luminous material which covers the other parts of the sun's surface One of these cavities he found to be about miles deep and many times as wide Some objections were made to this doctrine by M De la Laude in the Memoirs of the French Academy for the year which however have been ably answered by Professor Wilson in reply in the Philos Trans for Keil observes in his Astronomical Lectures p  We frequently see spots in the sun which are larger and broader not only than Europe or Africa but which even equal if they do not exceed the surface of the whole terraqueous globe  Now that these cavities are made in the sun's body by a process of nature similar to our earthquakes does not seem improbable on several accounts Because from this discovery of Dr Wilson it appears that the internal parts of the sun are not in a state of inflammation or of ejecting light like the external part or luminous ocean which covers it and hence that a greater degree of heat or inflammation and consequent expansion or explosion may occasionally be produced in its internal or dark nucleus Because the solar spots or cavities are frequently increased or diminished in size New ones are often produced And old ones vanish Because there are brighter or more luminous parts of the sun's disk called faculae by Scheiner and Hevelius which would seem to be volcanos in the sun or as Dr Wilson calls them  eructations of matter more luminous than that which covers the sun's surface  To which may be added that all the planets added together with their satellites do not amount to more than one six hundred and fiftieth part of the mass of the sun according to Sir Isaac Newton  Now if it could be supposed that the planets were originally thrown out of the sun by larger sunquakes than those frequent ones which occasion these spots or excavations abovementioned what would happen I According to the observations and opinion of Mr Herschel the sun itself and all its planets are moving forwards round some other centre with an unknown velocity which may be of opake matter corresponding with the very antient and general idea of a chaos Whence if a ponderous planet as Saturn could be supposed to be projected from the sun by an explosion the motion of the sun itself might be at the same time disturbed in such a manner as to prevent the planet from falling again into it As the sun revolves round its own axis its form must be that of an oblate spheroid like the earth and therefore a body projected from its surface perpendicularly upwards from that surface would not rise perpendicularly from the sun's centre unless it happened to be projected exactly from either of its poles or  from its equator Whence it may not be necessary that a planet if thus projected from the sun by explosion should again fall into the sun They would part from the sun's surface with the velocity with which that surface was moving and with the velocity acquired by the explosion and would therefore move round the sun in the same direction in which the sun rotates on its axis and perform eliptic orbits All the planets would move the same way round the sun from this first motion acquired at leaving its surface but their orbits would be inclined to each other according to the distance of the part where they were thrown out from the sun's equator Hence those which were ejected near the sun's equator would have orbits but little inclined to each other as the primary planets the plain of all whose orbits are inclined but seven degrees and a half from each other Others which were ejected near the sun's poles would have much more eccentric orbits as they would partake so much less of the sun's rotatory motion at the time they parted from his surface and would therefore be carried further from the sun by the velocity they had gained by the explosion which ejected them and become comets They would all obey the same laws of motion in their revolutions round the sun this has been determined by astronomers who have demonstrated that they move through equal areas in equal times As their annual periods would depend on the height they rose by the explosion these would differ in them all As their diurnal revolutions would depend on one side of the exploded matter adhering more than the other at the time it was torn off by the explosion these would also differ in the different planets and not bear any proportion to their annual periods Now as all these circumstances coincide with the known laws of the planetary system they serve to strengthen this conjecture  This coincidence of such a variety of circumstances induced M de Buffon to suppose that the planets were all struck off from the sun's surface by the impact of a large comet such as approached so near the sun's disk and with such amazing velocity in the year and is expected to return in But Mr Buffon did not recollect that these comets themselves are only planets with more eccentric orbits and that therefore it must be asked what had previously struck off these comets from the sun's body That if all these planets were struck off from the sun at the same time they must have been so near as to have attracted each other and have formed one mass That we shall want new causes for separating the secondary planets from the primary ones and must therefore look out for some other agent as it does not appear how the impulse of a comet could have made one planet roll round another at the time they both of them were driven off from the surface of the sun  If it should be asked why new planets are not frequently ejected from the sun it may be answered that after many large earthquakes many vents are left for the elastic vapours to escape and hence by the present appearance of the surface of our earth earthquakes prodigiously larger than any recorded in history have existed the same circumstances may have affected the sun on whose surface there are appearances of volcanos as described above Add to this that some of the comets and even the georgium sidus may for ought we know to the contrary have been emitted from the sun in more  modern days and have been diverted from their course and thus prevented from returning into the sun by their approach to some of the older planets which is somewhat countenanced by the opinion several philosophers have maintained that the quantity of matter of the sun has decreased Dr Halley observed that by comparing the proportion which the periodical time of the moon bore to that of the sun in former times with the proportion between them at present that the moon is found to be somewhat accelerated in respect to the sun Pemberton's View of Sir Isaac Newton p And so large is the body of this mighty luminary that all the planets thus thrown out of it would make scarcely any perceptible diminution of it as mentioned above The cavity mentioned above as measured by Dr Wilson of miles in depth not penetrating an hundredth part of the sun's semidiameter and yet as its width was many times greater than its depth was large enough to contain a greater body than our terrestrial world  I do not mean to conceal that from the laws of gravity unfolded by Sir Isaac Newton supposing the sun to be a sphere and to have no progressive motion and not liable itself to be disturbed by the supposed projection of the planets from it that such planets must return into the sun The late Rev William Ludlam of Leicester whose genius never met with reward equal to its merits in a letter to me dated January after having shewn as mentioned above that planets so projected from the sun would return to it adds  That a body as large as the moon so projected would disturb the motion of the earth in its orbit is certain but the calculation of such disturbing forces is difficult The body in some circumstances might become a satellite and both move round their common centre of gravity and that centre be carried in an annual orbit round the sun  There are other circumstances which might have concurred at the time of such supposed explosions which would render this idea not impossible I The planets might be thrown out of the sun at the time the sun itself was rising from chaos and be attracted by other suns in their vicinity rising at the same time out of chaos which would prevent them from returning into the sun The new planet in its course or ascent from the sun might explode and eject a satellite or perhaps more than one and thus by its course being affected might not return into the sun If more planets were ejected at the same time from the sun they might attract and disturb each others course at the time they left the body of the sun or very soon afterwards when they would be so much nearer each other  NOTE XVICALCAREOUS EARTH  While Ocean wrap'd it in his azure robe  CANTO II  FROM having observed that many of the highest mountains of the world consist of limestone replete with shells and that these mountains bear the marks of having been lifted up by subterraneous fires from the interior parts of the globe and as limestone replete with shells is found at the bottom of many of our deepest mines some philosophers have concluded that the nucleus of the earth was for many ages covered with water which was peopled with its adapted animals that the shells and bones of these animals in a long series of time produced solid strata in the ocean surrounding the original nucleus  These strata consist of the accumulated exuviae of shellfish the animals perished age after age but their shells remained and in progression of time produced the amazing quantities of limestone which almost cover the earth Other marine animals called coralloids raised walls and even mountains by the congeries of their calcareous habitations these perpendicular corralline rocks make some parts of the Southern Ocean highly dangerous as appears in the journals of Capt Cook From contemplating the immense strata of limestone both in respect to their extent and thickness formed from these shells of animals philosophers have been led to conclude that much of the water of the sea has been converted into calcareous earth by passing through their organs of digestion The formation of calcareous earth seems more particularly to be an animal process as the formation of clay belongs to the vegetable economy thus the shells of crabs and other testaceous fish are annually reproduced from the mucous membrane beneath them the shells of eggs are first a mucous membrane and the calculi of the kidneys and those found in all other parts of our system which sometimes contain calcareous earth seem to originate from inflamed membranes the bones themselves consist of calcareous earth united with the phosphoric or animal acid which may be separated by dissolving the ashes of calcined bones in the nitrous acid the various secretions of animals as their saliva and urine abound likewise with calcareous earth as appears by the incrustations about the teeth and the sediments of urine It is probable that animal mucus is a previous process towards the formation of calcareous earth and that all the calcareous earth in the world which is seen in limestones marbles spars alabasters marls which make up the greatest part of the earth's crust as far as it has yet been penetrated have been formed originally by animal and vegetable bodies from the mass of water and that by these means the solid part of the terraqueous globe has perpetually been in an increasing state and the water perpetually in a decreasing one  After the mountains of shells and other recrements of aquatic animals were elevated above the water the upper heaps of them were gradually dissolved by rains and dews and oozing through were either perfectly crystallized in smaller cavities and formed  calcareous spar or were imperfectly crystallized on the roofs of larger cavities and produced stalactites or mixing with other undissolved shells beneath them formed marbles which were more or less crystallized and more or less pure or lastly after being dissolved the water was exhaled from them in such a manner that the external parts became solid and forming an arch prevented the internal parts from approaching each other so near as to become solid and thus chalk was produced I have specimens of chalk formed at the root of several stalactites and in their central parts and of other stalactites which are hollow like quills from a similar cause viz from the external part of the stalactite hardening first by its evaporation and thus either attracting the internal dissolved particles to the crust or preventing them from approaching each other so as to form a solid body Of these I saw many hanging from the arched roof of a cellar under the high street in Edinburgh  If this dissolved limestone met with vitriolic acid it was converted into alabaster parting at the same time with its fixable air If it met with the fluor acid it became fluor if with the siliceous acid flint and when mixed with clay and sand or either of them acquires the name of marl And under one or other of these forms composes a great part of the solid globe of the earth  Another mode in which limestone appears is in the form of round granulated particles but slightly cohering together of this kind a bed extends over Lincoln heath perhaps twenty miles long by ten wide The form of this calcareous sand its angles having been rubbed off and the flatness of its bed evinces that that part of the country was so formed under water the particles of sand having thus been rounded like all other rounded pebbles This round form of calcareous sand and of other larger pebbles is produced under water partly by their being more or less soluble in water and hence the angular parts become dissolved first by their exposing a larger surface to the action of the menstruum and secondly from their attrition against each other by the streams or tides for a great length of time successively as they were collected and perhaps when some of them had not acquired their hardest state  This calcareous sand has generally been called kettonstone and believed to resemble the spawn of fish it has acquired a form so much rounder than siliceous sand from its being of so much softer a texture and also much more soluble in water There are other soft calcareous stones called tupha which are deposited from water on mosses as at Matlock from which moss it is probable the water may receive something which induces it the readier to part with its earth  In some limestones the living animals seem to have been buried as well as their shells during some great convulsion of nature these shells contain a black coaly substance within them in others some phlogiston or volatile alcali from the bodies of the dead animals remains mixed with the stone which is then called liverstone as it emits a sulphurous smell on being struck and there is a stratum about six inches thick extends a considerable way over the iron ore at Wingerworth near Chesterfield in Derbyshire which seems evidently to have been formed from the shells of freshwater muscles  There is however another source of calcareous earth besides the aquatic one above described and that is from the recrements of land animals and vegetables as found in marls which consist of various mixtures of calcareous earth sand and clay all of them perhaps principally from vegetable origin  Dr Hutton is of opinion that the rocks of marble have been softened by fire into a fluid mass which he thinks under immense pressure might be done without the escape of their carbonic acid or fixed air Edinb Transact Vol I If this ingenious idea be allowed it might account for the purity of some white marbles as during their fluid state there might be time for their partial impurities whether from the bodies of the animals which produced the shells or from other extraneous matter either to sublime to the uppermost part of the stratum or to subside to the lowermost part of it As a confirmation of this theory of Dr Hutton's it may be added that some calcareous stones are found mixed with lime and have thence lost a part of their fixed air or carbonic gas as the bathstone and on that account hardens on being exposed to the air and mixed with sulphur produces calcareous liver of sulphur Falconer on Bathwater Vol I p and p Mr Monnet found lime in powder in the mountains of Auvergne and suspected it of volcanic origin Kirwan's Min p  NOTE XVIIMORASSES  Gnomes you then taught transuding dews to pass  Through timefallen woods and rootinwove morass  CANTO II l  WHERE woods have repeatedly grown and perished morasses are in process of time produced and by their long roots fill up the interstices till the whole becomes for many yards deep a mass of vegetation This fact is curiously verified by an account given many years ago by the Earl of Cromartie of which the following is a short abstract  In the year the EARL OF CROMARTIE being then nineteen years of age saw a plain in the parish of Lockburn covered over with a firm standing wood which was so old that not only the trees had no green leaves upon them but the bark was totally thrown off which he was there informed by the old countrymen was the universal manner in which firwoods terminated and that in twenty or thirty years the trees would cast themselves up by the roots About fifteen years after he had occasion to travel the same way and observed that there was not a tree nor the appearance of a root of any of them but in their place the whole plain where the wood stood was  covered with a flat green moss or morass and on asking the country people what was become of the wood he was informed that no one had been at the trouble to carry it away but that it had all been overturned by the wind that the trees lay thick over each other and that the moss or bog had overgrown the whole timber which they added was occasioned by the moisture which came down from the high hills above it and stagnated upon the plain and that nobody could yet pass over it which however his Lordship was so incautious as to attempt and slipt up to the armpits Before the year that whole piece of ground was become a solid moss wherein the peasants then dug turf or peat which however was not yet of the best sort Philos Trans No Abridg Vol V p  Morasses in great length of time undergo variety of changes first by elutriation and afterwards by fermentation and the consequent heat By water perpetually oozing through them the most soluble parts are first washed away as the essential salts these together with the salts from animal recrements are carried down the rivers into the sea where all of them seem to decompose each other except the marine salt Hence the ashes of peat contain little or no vegetable alcali and are not used in the countries where peat constitutes the fuel of the lower people for the purpose of washing linen The second thing which is always seen oozing from morasses is iron in solution which produces chalybeate springs from whence depositions of ochre and variety of iron ores The third elutriation seems to consist of vegetable acid which by means unknown appears to be converted into all other acids Into marine and nitrous acids as mentioned above Into vitriolic acid which is found in some morasses so plentifully as to preserve the bodies of animals from putrefaction which have been buried in them and this acid carried away by rain and dews and meeting with calcareous earth produces gypsum or alabaster with clay it produces alum and deprived of its vital air produces sulphur Fluor acid which being washed away and meeting with calcareous earth produces fluor or cubic spar The siliceous acid which seems to have been disseminated in great quantity either by solution in water or by solution in air and appears to have produced the sand in the sea uniting with calcareous earth previously dissolved in that element from which were afterwards formed some of the gritstone rocks by means of a siliceous or calcareous cement By its union with the calcareous earth of the morass other strata of siliceous sand have been produced and by the mixture of this with clay and lime arose the beds of marl  In other circumstances probably where less moisture has prevailed morasses seem to have undergone a fermentation as other vegetable matter new hay for instance is liable to do from the great quantity of sugar it contains From the great heat thus produced in the lower parts of immense beds of morass the phlogistic part or oil or asphaltum becomes distilled and rising into higher strata becomes again condensed forming coalbeds of greater or less purity according to their greater or less quantity of inflammable matter at the same time the clay beds become purer or less so as the phlogistic part is more or less completely exhaled from them Though coal and clay are frequently produced in this manner yet I have no doubt but that they are likewise often produced by  elutriation in situations on declivities the clay is washed away down into the valleys and the phlogistic part or coal left behind this circumstance is seen in many valleys near the beds of rivers which are covered recently by a whitish impure clay called waterclay See note XIX XX and XXIII  LORD CROMARTIE has furnished another curious observation on morasses in the paper above referred to In a moss near the town of Eglin in Murray though there is no river or water which communicates with the moss yet for three or four feet of depth in the moss there are little shellfish resembling oysters with living fish in them in great quantities though no such fish are found in the adjacent rivers nor even in the water pits in the moss but only in the solid substance of the moss This curious fact not only accounts for the shells sometimes found on the surface of coals and in the clay above them but also for a thin stratum of shells which sometimes exists over ironore  NOTE XVIIIIRON  Cold waves immerged the glowing mass congeal  And turn to adamant the

materials is shewn by a curious experiment of M Ingenhouz A fine iron wire twisted spirally is fixed to a cork on the point of the spire is fixed a match made of agaric dipped in solution of nitre the match is then ignited and the wire with the cork put immediately into a bottle full of vital air the match first burns vividly and the iron soon takes fire and consumes with brilliant sparks till it is reduced to small brittle globules gaining an addition of about one third of its weight by its union with vital air Annales de Chymic Traité de Chimie per Lavoisier c iii  STEEL  It is probably owing to a total deprivation of vital air which it holds with so great avidity that iron on being kept many hours or days in ignited charcoal becomes converted into steel and thence acquires the faculty of being welded when red hot long before it melts and also the power of becoming hard when immersed in cold water both which I suppose depend on the same cause that is on its being a worse conductor of heat than other metals and hence the surface both acquires heat much sooner and loses it much sooner than the internal parts of it in thiscircumstance resembling glass  When steel is made very hot and suddenly immerged in very cold water and moved about in it the surface of the steel becomes cooled first and thus producing a kind of case or arch over the internal part prevents that internal part from contracting quite so much as it otherwise would do whence it becomes brittler and harder like the glassdrops called Prince Rupert's drops which are made by dropping melted glass into cold water This idea is countenanced by the circumstance that hardened steel is specifically lighter than steel which is more gradually cooled Nicholson's Chemistry p Why the brittleness and hardness of steel or glass should keep pace or be companions to each other may be difficult to conceive  When a steel spring is forcibly bent till it break it requires less power to bend it through the first inch than the second and less through the second than the third the same I suppose to happen if a wire be distended till it break by hanging weights to it this shews that the particles may be forced from each other to a small distance by less power than is necessary to make them recede to a greater distance in this circumstance perhaps the attraction of cohesion differs from that of gravitation which exerts its power inversely as the squares of the distance Hence it appears that is the innermost particles of a steel bar by cooling the external surface first are kept from approaching each other so nearly as they otherwise would do that they become in the situation of the particles on the convex side of a bent spring and can not be forced further from each other except by a greater power than would have been necessary to have made them recede thus far And secondly that if they be forced a little further from each other they separate this may be exemplified by laying two magnetic needles parallel to each other the contrary poles together then drawing them longitudinally from each other they will slide with small force till they begin to separate and will then require a stronger force to really separate them Hence it appears that hardness and brittleness depend on the same circumstance that the particles are removed to a greater distance from each other and thus resist any power more forcibly which is applied to displace them further this constitutes hardness And secondly if they are displaced by such applied force they immediately separate and this constitutes brittleness  Steel may be thus rendered too brittle for many purposes on which account artists have means of softening it again by exposing it to certain degrees of heat for the construction of different kinds of tools which is called tempering it Some artists plunge large tools in very cold water as soon as they are compleatly ignited and moving it about  take it out as soon as it ceases to be luminous beneath the water it is then rubbed quickly with a file or on sand to clean the surface the heat which the metal still retains soon begins to produce a succession of colours if a hard temper be required the piece is dipped again and stirred about in cold water as soon as the yellow tinge appears if it be cooled when the purple tinge appears it becomes fit for gravers' tools used in working upon metals if cooled while blue it is proper for springs Nicholson's Chemistry p Keir's Chemical Dictionary  MODERN PRODUCTION OF IRON  The recent production of iron is evinced from the chalybeate waters which flow from morasses which lie upon gravelbeds and which must therefore have produced iron after those gravelbeds were raised out of the sea On the south side of the road between Cheadle and Okeymoor in Staffordshire yellow stains of iron are seen to penetrate the gravel from a thin morass on its surface There is a fissure eight or ten feet wide in a gravelbed on the eastern side of the hollow road ascending the hill about a mile from Trentham in Staffordshire leading toward Drayton in Shropshire which fissure is filled up with nodules of ironore A bank of sods is now raised against this fissure to prevent the loose iron nodules from falling into the turnpike road and thus this natural curiosity is at present concealed from travellers A similar fissure in a bed of marl and filled up with iron nodules and with some large pieces of flint is seen on the eastern side of the hollow road ascending the hill from the turnpike house about a mile from Derby in the road towards Burton And another such fissure filled with iron nodes appears about half a mile from NewtonSolney in Derbyshire in the road to Burton near the summit of the hill These collections of iron and of flint must have been produced posterior to the elevation of all those hills and were thence evidently of vegetable or animal origin To which should be added that iron is found in general in beds either near the surface of the earth or stratified with clay coals or argillaceous grit which are themselves productions of the modern world that is from the recrements of vegetables and airbreathing animals  Not only iron but mangancse calamy and even copper and lead appear in some instances to have been of recent production Iron and manganese are detected in all vegetable productions and it is probable other metallic bodies might be found to exist in vegetable or animal matters if we had tests to detect them in very minute quantities Manganese and calamy are found in beds like iron near the surface of the earth and in a calciform state which countenances their modern production The recent production of calamy one of the ores of zinc appears from its frequently incrusting calcareous spar in its descent from the surface of the earth into the uppermost fissures of the limestone mountains of Derbyshire That the calamy has been carried by its solution or diffusion in water into these cavities and not by its ascent from below in form of steam is evinced from its not only forming a crust over the dogtooth spar but by its afterwards dissolving or destroying the sparry crystal I have specimens of calamy in the form of dogtooth spar two inches high which are hollow and stand half an inch above the diminished  sparry crystal on which they were formed like a sheath a great deal too big for it this seems to shew that this process was carried on in water otherwise after the calamy had incrusted its spar and dissolved its surface so as to form a hollow cavern over it it could not act further upon it except by the interposition of some medium As these spars and calamy are formed in the fissures of mountains they must both have been formed after the elevation of those mountains  In respect to the recent production of copper it was before observed in note on Canto II l that the summit of the gritstone mountain at Hawkstone in Shropshire is tinged with copper which from the appearance of the blue stains seems to have descended to the parts of the rock beneath I have a calciform ore of copper consisting of the hollow crusts of cubic cells which has evidently been formed on crystals of fluor which it has eroded in the same manner as the calamy erodes the calcareous crystals from whence may be deduced in the same manner the aqueous solution or diffusion as well as the recent production of this calciform ore of copper  Lead in small quantities is sometimes found in the fissures of coalbeds which fissures are previously covered with spar and sometimes in nodules of ironore Of the former I have a specimen from near Caulk in Derbyshire and of the latter from Colebrook Dale in Shropshire Though all these facts shew that some metallic bodies are formed from vegetable or animal recrements as iron and perhaps manganese and calamy all which are found near the surface of the earth yet as the other metals are found only in fissures of rocks which penetrate to unknown depths they may be wholly or in part produced by ascending steams from subterraneous fires as mentioned in note on Canto II l  SEPTARIA OF IRONSTONE  Over some lime works at Walsall in Staffordshire I observed some years ago a stratum of iron earth about six inches thick full of very large cavities these cavities were evidently produced when the material passed from a semifluid state into a solid one as the frit of the potters or a mixture of clay and water is liable to crack in drying which is owing to the further contraction of the internal part after the crust is become hard These hollows are liable to receive extraneous matter as I believe gypsum and sometimes spar and even lead a curious specimen of the last was presented to me by Mr Darby of Colebrook Dale which contains in its cavity some ounces of leadore But there are other septaria of ironstone which seem to have had a very different origin their cavities having been formed in cooling or congealing from an ignited state as is ingeniously deduced by Dr Hutton from their internal struture Edinb Transact Vol I p The volcanic origin of these curious septaria appears to me to be further evinced from their form and the places where they are found They consist of oblate spheroids and are found in many parts of the earth totally detached from the beds in which they lie as at East Lothian in Scotland Two of these which now lie before me were found with many others immersed in argillaceous shale or shiver surrounded by broken limestone mountains at Bradbourn near Ashbourn in Derbyshire and were presented to  me by Mr Buxton a gentleman of that town One of these is about fifteen inches in its equatorial diameter and about six inches in its polar one and contains beautiful starlike septaria incrusted and in part filled with calcareous spar The other is about eight inches in its equatorial diameter and about four inches in its polar diameter and is quite solid but shews on its internal surface marks of different colours as if a beginning separation had taken place Now as these septaria contain fifty per cent of iron according to Dr Hutton they would soften or melt into a semifluid globule by subterraneous fire by less heat than the limestone in their vicinity and if they were ejected through a hole or fissure would gain a circular motion along with their progressive one by their greater friction or adhesion to one side of the hole This whirling motion would produce the oblate spheroidical form which they possess and which as far as I know can not in any other way be accounted for They would then harden in the air as they rose into the colder parts of the atmosphere and as they descended into so soft a material as shale or shiver their forms would not be injured in their fall and their presence in materials so different from themselves becomes accounted for  About the tropics of the large septarium above mentioned are circular eminent lines such as might have been left is it had been coarsely turned in a lathe These lines seem to consist of a fluid matter which seems to have exsuded in circular zones as their edges appear blunted or retracted and the septarium seems to have split easier in such sections parallel to its equator Now as the crust would first begin to cool and harden after its ejection in a semifluid state and the equatorial diameter would become gradually enlarged as it rose in the air the internal parts being softer would slide beneath the polar crust which might crack and permit part of the semifluid to exsude and it is probable the adhesion would thus become less in sections parallel to the equator Which further confirms this idea of the production of these curious septaria A newcast cannon ball redhot with its crust only solid if it were shot into the air would propably burst in its passage as it would consist of a more fluid material than these septaria and thus by discharging a shower of liquid iron would produce more dreadful combustion if used in war than could be effected by a ball which had been cooled and was heated again since in the latter case the ball could not have its internal parts made hotter than the crust of it without first loosing its form  NOTE XIXFLINT  Transmute to glittering flints her chalky lands  Or sink on Ocean's bed in countless sands  CANTO II l  SILICEOUS ROCKS  THE great masses of siliceous sand which lie in rocks upon the beds of limestone or which are stratified with clay coal and ironore are evidently produced in the decomposition of vegetable or animal matters as explained in the note on morasses Hence the impressions of vegetable roots and even whole trees are often found in sandstone as well as in coals and ironore In these sandrocks both the siliceous acid and the calcareous base seem to be produced from the materials of the morass for though the prefence of a siliceous acid and of a calcareous base have not yet been separately exhibited from flints yet from the analogy of flint to fluor and gypsum and marble and from the conversion of the latter into flint there can be little doubt of their existence  These siliceous sandrocks are either held together by a siliceous cement or have a greater or less portion of clay in them which in some acts as a cement to the siliceous crystals but in others is in such great abundance that in burning them they become an imperfect porcelain and are then used to repair the roads as at Chesterfield in Derbyshire these are called argillaceous grit by Mr Kirwan In other places a calcareous matter cements the crystals together and in other places the siliceous crystals lie in loose strata under the marl in the form of white sand as at Normington about a mile from Derby  The lowest beds of siliceous sandstone produced from morasses seem to obtain their acid from the morass and their calcareous base from the limestone on which it rests These beds possess a siliceous cement and from their greater purity and hardness are used for course grindingstones and scyth stones and are situated on the edges of limestone countries having lost the other strata of coals or clay or iron which were originally produced above them Such are the sandrocks incumbent on limestone near Matlock in Derbyshire As these siliceous sandrocks contain no marine productions scattered amongst them they appear to have been elevated torn to pieces and many fragments of them scattered over the adjacent country by explosions from fires within the morass from which they have been formed and which dissipated every thing inflammable above and beneath them except some stains of iron with which they are in some places spotted If these sandrocks had been accumulated beneath the sea and elevated along with the beds of limestone on which they rest some vestiges of marine shells either in their siliceous or calcareous state must have been discerned amongst them  SILICEOUS TREES  In many of these sandrocks are found the impressions of vegetable roots which seem to have been the most unchangeable parts of the plant as shells and shark's teeth are found in chalkbeds from their being the most unchangeable parts of the animal In other instances the wood itself is penetrated and whole trees converted into flint specimens of which I have by me from near Covenery and from a gravelpit in Shropshire near Child's Archal in the road to Drayton Other polished specimens of vegetable flints abound in the cabinets of the curious which evidently shew the concentric circles of woody fibres and their interstices filled with whiter siliceous matter with the branching off of the knots when cut horizontally and the parallel lines of wood when cut longitudinally with uncommon beauty and variety Of these I possess some beautiful specimens which were presented to me by the Earl of Uxbridge  The colours of these siliceous vegetables are generally brown from the iron I suppose or manganese which induced them to crystallize or to fuse more easily Some of the cracks of the wood in drying are filled with white flint or calcedony and others of them remain hollow lined with innumerable small crystals tinged with iron which I suppose had a share in converting their calcareous matter into siliceous crystals because the crystals called Peakdiamonds are always found bedded in an ochreous earth and those called Bristolstones are situated on limestone coloured with iron Mr F French presented me with a congeries of siliceous crystals which he gathered on the crater as he supposes of an extinguished volcano at Cromach Water in Cumberland The crystals are about an inch high in the shape of dogtooth or calcareous spar covered with a dark ferruginous matter The bed on which they rest is about an inch in thickness and is stained with iron on its undersurface This curious fossil shews the transmutation of calcareous earth into siliceous as much as the siliceous shells which abound in the cabinets of the curious There may sometime be discovered in this age of science a method of thus impregnating wood with liquid flint which would produce pillars for the support and tiles for the covering of houses which would be uninflammable and endure as long as the earth beneath them  That some siliceous productions have been in a fluid state without much heat at the time of their formation appears from the vegetable flints above described not having quite lost their organized appearance from shells and coralloids and entrochi being converted into flint without loosing their form from the bason of calcedony round Giesar in Iceland and from the experiment of Mr Bergman who obtained thirteen regular formed crystals by suffering the powder of quartz to remain in a vessel with fluor acid for two years these crystals were about the size of small peas and were not so hard as quartz Opusc de Terrâ Siliceâ p Mr Achard procured both calcareous and siliceous crystals one from calcareous earth and the other from the earth of alum both dissolved in water impregnated with fixed air the water filtrating very slowly through a porous bottom of baked clay See Journal de Physique for January  AGATES ONYXES SCOTSPEBBLES  In small cavities of these sandrocks I am informed the beautiful siliceous nodules are found which are called Scot'spebbles and which on being cut in different directions take the names of agates onyxes sardonyxes c according to the colours of the lines or strata which they exhibit Some of the nodules are hollow and filled with crystals others have a nucleus of less compact siliceous matter which is generally white surrounded with many concentric strata coloured with iron and other alternate strata of white agate or calcedony sometimes to the number of thirty  I think these nodules bear evident marks of their having been in perfect fusion by either heat alone or by water and heat under great pressure according to the ingenious theory of Dr Hutton but I do not imagine that they were injected into cavities from materials from without but that some vegetables or parts of vegetables containing more iron or manganese than others facilitated the compleat fusion thus destroying the vestiges of vegetable organization which were conspicuous in the siliceous trees above mentioned Some of these nodules being hollow and lined with crystals and others containing a nucleus of white siliceous matter of a looser texture shew they were composed of the materials then existing in the cavity which consisting before of loose sand must take up less space when fused into a solid mass  These siliceous nodules resemble the nodules of ironstone mentioned in note on Canto II l in respect to their possessing a great number of concentric spheres coloured generally with iron but they differ in this circumstance that the concentric spheres generally obey the form of the external crust and in their not possessing a chalybeate nucleus The stalactites formed on the roofs of caverns are often coloured in concentric strata by their coats being spread over each other at different times and some of them as the cupreous ones possess great beauty from this formation but as these are necessarily more or less of a cylindrical or conic form the nodules or globular flints above described cannot have been constructed in this manner To what law of nature then is to be referred the production of such numerous concentric spheres I suspect to the law of congelation  When salt and water are exposed to severe frosty air the salt is said to be precipitated as the water freezes that is as the heat in which it was dissolved is withdrawn where the experiment is tried in a bowl or bason this may be true as the surface freezes first and the salt is found at the bottom But in a fluid exposed in a thin phial I found by experiment that the extraneous matter previously dissolved by the heat in the mixture was not simply set at liberty to subside but was detruded or pushed backward as the ice was produced The experiment was this about two ounces of a solution of blue vitriol were accidentally frozen in a thin phial the glass was cracked and fallen to pieces the ice was dissolved and I found a pillar of blue vitriol standing erect on the bottom of the broken bottle Nor is this power of congelation more extraordinary than that by its powerful and sudden expansion it should burst iron shells and coehorns or throw  out the plugs with which the water was secured in them above one hundred and thirty yards according to the experiments at Quebec by Major Williams Edinb Transact Vol II p  In some siliceous nodules which now lie before me the external crust for about the tenth of an inch consists of white agate in others it is much thinner and in some much thicker corresponding with this crust there are from twenty to thirty superincumbent strata of alternately darker and lighter colour whence it appears that the external crust as it cooled or froze propelled from it the iron or manganese which was dissolved in it this receded till it had formed an arch or vault strong enough to resist its further protrusion then the next inner sphere or stratum as it cooled or froze propelled forwards its colouring matter in the same manner till another arch or sphere produced sufficient resistance to this frigorific expulsion Some of them have detruded their colouring matter quite to the centre the rings continuing to become darker as they are nearer it in others the chalybeate arch seems to have stopped half an inch from the centre and become thicker by having attracted to itself the irony matter from the white nucleus owing probably to its cooling less precipitately in the central parts than at the surface of the pebble  A similar detrusion of a marly matter in circular arches or vaults obtains in the salt mines in Cheshire from whence Dr Hutton very ingeniously concludes that the salt must have been liquified by heat which would seem to be be much confirmed by the above theory Edinb Transact Vol I p  I cannot conclude this account of Scotspebbles without observing that some of them on being sawed longitudinally asunder seem still to possess some vestiges of the cylindrical organization of vegetables others possess a nucleus of white agate much resembling some bulbous roots with their concentric coats or the knots in elmroots or crabtrees some of these I suppose were formed in the manner above explained during the congelation of masses of melted flint and iron others may have been formed from a vegetable nucleus and retain some vestiges of the organization of the plant  SAND OF THE SEA  The great abundance of siliceous sand at the bottom of the ocean may in part be washed down from the siliceous rocks above described but in general I suppose it derives its acid only from the vegetable and animal matter of morasses which is carried down by floods or by the atmosphere and becomes united in the sea with its calcareous base from shells and coralloids and thus assumes its crystalline form at the bottom of the ocean and is there intermixed with gravel or other matters washed from the mountains in its vicinity  CHERT OR PETROSILEX  The rocks of marble are often alternately intermixed with strata of chert or coarse flint and this in beds from one to three feet thick as at Ilam and Matlock or of less than the tenth of an inch in thickness as a mile or two from Bakewell in the road to  Buxton It is difficult to conceive in what manner ten or twenty strata of either limestone or flint of different shades of white and black could be laid quite regularly over each other from sediments or precipitations from the sea it appears to me much easier to comprehend by supposing with Dr Hutton that both the solid rocks of marble and the flint had been fused by great heat or by heat and water under immense pressure by its cooling or congelating the colouring matter might be detruded and form parallel or curvilinean strata as above explained  The colouring matter both of limestone and flint was probably owing to the flesh of peculiar animals as well as the siliceous acid which converted some of the limestone into flint or to some strata of shellfish having been overwhelmed when alive with new materials while others dying in their natural situations would lose their fleshy parts either by its putrid solution in the water or by its being eaten by other seainsects I have some calcareous fossil shells which contain a black coaly matter in them which was evidently the body of the animal and others of the same kind filled with spar instead of it The Labradore stone has I suppose its colours from the nacre or motherpearl shells from which it was probably produced And there is a stratum of calcareous matter about six or eight inches thick at Wingerworth in Derbyshire over the ironbeds which is replete with shells of freshwater muscles and evidently obtains its dark colour from them as mentioned in note XVI Many nodules of flint resemble in colour as well as in form the shell of the echinus or seaurchin others resemble some coralloids both in form and colour and M Arduini found in the Monte de Pancrasio red flints branching like corals from whence they seem to have obtained both their form and their colour Ferber's Travels in Italy p  NODULES OF FLINT IN CHALKBEDS  As the nodules of flint found in chalkbeds possess no marks of having been rounded by attrition or solution I conclude that they have gained their form as well as their dark colour from the flesh of the shellfish from which they had their origin but which have been so compleatly fused by heat or heat and water as to obliterate all vestiges of the shell in the same manner as the nodules of agate and onyx were produced from parts of vegetables but which had been so completely fused as to obliterate all marks of their organization or as many ironnodules have obtained their form and origin from peculiar vegetables  Some nodules in chalkbeds consist of shells of echini filled up with chalk the animal having been dissolved away by putrescence in water or eaten by other seainsects other shells of echini in which I suppose the animal's body remained are converted into flint but still retain the form of the shell Others I suppose as above being more completely fused have become flint coloured by the animal flesh but without the exact form either of the flesh or shell of the animal Many of these are hollow within and lined with crystals like the Scot'spebbles above described but as the colouring matter of animal  bodies differs but little from each other compared with those of vegetables these flints vary less in their colours than those above mentioned At the same time as they cooled in concentric spheres like the Scot'spebbles they often possess faint rings of colours and always break in concholoid forms like them  This idea of the production of nodules of flint in chalkbeds is countenanced from the iron which generally appears as these flints become decomposed by the air which by uniting with the iron in their composition reduces it from a vitrescent state to that of calx and thus renders it visible And secondly by there being no appearance in chalkbeds of a string or pipe of siliceous matter connecting one nodule with another which must have happened if the siliceous matter or its acid had been injected from without according to the idea of Dr Hutton And thirdly because many of them have very large cavities at their centres which should not have happened had they been formed by the injection of a material from without  When shells or chalk are thus converted from calcareous to siliceous matter by the flesh of the animal the new flint being heavier than the shell or chalk occupies less space than the materials it was produced from this is the cause of frequent cavities within them where the whole mass has not been completely fused and pressed together In Derbyshire there are masses of coralloid and other shells which have become siliceous and are thus left with large vacuities sometimes within and sometimes on the outside of the remaining form of the shell like the French millstones and I suppose might serve the same purpose the gravel of the Derwent is full of specimens of this kind  Since writing the above I have received a very ingenious account of chalkbeds from Dr MENISH of Chelmsford He distinguishes chalkbeds into three kinds such as have been raised from the sea with little disturbance of their strata as the cliffs of Dover and Margate which he terms  intire  chalk Another state of chalk is where it has suffered much derangement as the banks of the Thames at Gravesend and Dartford And a third state where fragments of chalk have been rounded by water which he terms  alluvial  chalk In the first of these situations of chalk he observes that the flint lies in strata horizontally generally in distinct nodules but that he has observed two instances of solid plates or strata of flint from an inch to two inches in thickness interposed between the chalkbeds one of these is in a chalkbank by the road side at Berkhamstead the other in a bank on the road from Chatham leading to Canterbury Dr Menish has further observed that many of the echini are crushed in their form and yet filled with flint which has taken the form of the crushed shell and that though many flint nodules are hollow yet that in some echini the siliceum seems to have enlarged as it passed from a fluid to a solid state as it swells out in a protuberance at the mouth and anus of the shell and that though these shells are so filled with flint yet that in many places the shell itself remains calcareous These strata of nodules and plates of flint seem to countenance their origin from the flesh of a stratum of animals which perished by some natural violence and were buried in their shells  ANGLES OF SILICEOUS SAND  In many rocks of siliceous sand the particles retain their angular form and in some beds of loose sand of which there is one of considerable purity a few yards beneath the marl at Normington about a mile south of Derby Other siliceous sands have had their angles rounded off like the pebbles in gravelbeds These seem to owe their globular form to two causes one to their attrition against each other when they may for centuries have lain at the bottom of the sea or of rivers where they may have been progressively accumulated and thus progressively at the same time rubbed upon each other by the dashing of the water and where they would be more easily rolled over each other by the their gravity being so much less than in air This is evidently now going on in the river Derwent for though there are no limestone rocks for ten or fifteen miles above Derby yet a great part of the rivergravel at Derby consists of limestone nodules whose angles are quite worn off in their descent down the stream  There is however another cause which must have contributed to round the angles both of calcareous and siliceous fragments and that is their solubility in water calcareous earth is perpetually found suspended in the waters which pass over it and the earth of flints was observed by Bergman to be contained in water in the proportion of one grain to a gallon Kirwan's Mineralogy p In boiling water however it is soluble in much greater proportion as appears from the siliceous earth sublimed in the distillation of fluor acid in glass vessels and from the basons of calcedony which surrounded the jets of hot water near mount Heccla in Iceland Troil on Iceland It is probable most siliceous sands or pebbles have at some ages of the world been long exposed to aqueous steams raised by subterranean fires And if fragments of stone were long immersed in a fluid menstrum their angular parts would be first dissolved on account of their greater surface  Many beds of siliceous gravel are cemented together by a siliceous cement and are called breccia as the plumbpudding stones of Hartfordshire and the walls of a subterraneous temple excavated by Mr Curzon at Hagley near Rugely in Staffordshire these may have been exposed to great heat as they were immersed in water which water under great pressure of superincumbent materials may have been rendered redhot as in Papin's digester and have thus possessed powers of solution with which we are unacquainted  BASALTES AND GRANITES  Another sourse of siliceous stones is from the granite or basaltes or porphyries which are of different hardnesses according to the materials of their composition or to the fire they have undergone such are the stones of Arthur'shill near Edinburgh of the Giant's Causway in Ireland and of Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire the uppermost stratum of which last seems to have been cracked either by its elevation or by its hastily cooling after ignition by the contact of dews or snows and thus breaks into angular fragments such as the streets of London are paved with or have had their angles rounded by  attrition or by partial solution and have thus formed the common paving stones or bowlers as well as the gravel which is often rolled into strata amid the siliceous sandbeds which are either formed or collected in the sea  In what manner such a mass of crystallized matter as the Giant's Causway and similar columns of basaltes could have been raised without other volcanic appearances may be a matter not easy to comprehend but there is another power in nature besides that of expansile vapour which may have raised some materials which have previously been in igneous or aqueous solution and that is the act of congelation When the water in the experiments above related of Major Williams had by congelation thrown out the plugs from the bombshells a column of ice rose from the hole of the bomb six or eight inches high Other bodies I suspect increase in bulk which crystallize in cooling as iron and typemetal I remember pouring eight or ten pounds of melted brimstone into a pot to cool and was surprized to see after a little time a part of the fluid beneath break a hole in the congealed crust above it and gradually rise into a promontory several inches high the basaltes has many marks of fusion and of crystallization and may thence as well as many other kinds of rocks as of spar marble petrosilex jasper c have been raised by the power of congelation a power whose quantity has not yet been ascertained and perhaps greater and more universal than that of vapours expanded by heat These basaltic columns rise sometimes out of mountains of granite itself as mentioned by Dr Beddoes Phil Transact Vol LXXX and as they seem to consist of similar materials more completely fused there is still greater reason to believe them to have been elevated in the cooling or crystallization of the mass See note XXIV  NOTE XXCLAY  Whence ductile Clays in wide expansion spread  Soft as the Cygnet's down their snowwhite bed  CANTO II l  THE philosophers who have attended to the formation of the earth have acknowledged two great agents in producing the various changes which the terraqueous globe has undergone and these are water and fire Some of them have perhaps ascribed too much to one of these great agents of nature and some to the other They have generally agreed that the stratification of materials could only be produced from sediments or precipitations which were previously mixed or dissolved in the sea and that whatever effects were produced by fire were performed afterwards  There is however great difficulty in accounting for the universal stratification of the solid globe of the earth in this manner since many of the materials which appear in strata could not have been suspended in water as the nodules of flint in chalkbeds the extensive beds of shells and lastly the strata of coal clay sand and ironore which in most coalcountries lie from five to seven times alternately stratified over each other and none of them are soluble in water Add to this if a solution of them or a mixture of them in water could be supposed the cause of that solution must cease before a precipitation could commence  The great masses of lava under the various names of granite porphyry toadstone moorstone rag and slate which constitute the old word may have acquired the stratification which some of them appear to possess by their having been formed by successive eruptions of a fluid mass which at different periods of antient time arose from volcanic shafts and covered each other the surface of the interior mass of lava would cool and become solid before the superincumbent stratum was poured over it to the same cause may be ascribed their different compositions and textures which are scarcely the same in any two parts of the world  The stratifications of the great masses of limestone which were produced from seashells seem to have been formed by the different times at which the innumerable shells were produced and deposited A colony of echini or madrepores or cornua ammonis lived and perished in one period of time in another a new colony of either similar or different shells lived and died over the former ones producing a stratum of more recent shell over a stratum of others which had began to petrify or to become marble and thus from unknown depths to what are now the summits of mountains the limestone is disposed in strata of varying solidity and colour These have afterwards undergone variety of changes by their solution and deposition from the water in which they were immersed or from having been exposed to great heat under great pressure according to the ingenious theory of Dr Hutton Edinb Transact Vol I Sec Note XVI  In most of the coalcountries of this island there are from five to seven beds of coal stratified with an equal number of beds though of much greater thickness of clay and sandstone and occasionally of ironores In what manner to account for the stratification of these materials seems to be a problem of greater difficulty Philosophers have generally supposed that they have been arranged by the currents of the sea but considering their insolubility in water and their almost similar specific gravity an accumulation of them in such distinct beds from this cause is altogether inconceiveable though some coalcountries bear marks of having been at some time immersed beneath the waves and raised again by subterranean fires  The higher and lower parts of morasses were necessarily produced at different periods of time see Note XVII and would thus originally be formed in strata of different ages For when an old wood perished and produced a morass many centuries would elapse before another wood could grow and perish again upon the same ground which would thus produce a new stratum of morass over the other differing indeed principally in its age and perhaps as the timber might be different in the proportions of its component parts  Now if we suppose the lowermost stratum of a morass become ignited like fermenting hay after whatever could be carried away by solution in water was gone what would happen Certainly the inflammable part the oil sulphur or bitumen would burn away and be evaporated in air and the fixed parts would be left as clay lime and iron while some of the calcareous earth would join with the siliceous acid and produce sand or with the argillaceous earth and produce marl Thence after many centuries another bed would take fire but with less degree of ignition and with a greater body of morass over it what then would happen The bitumen and sulphur would rise and might become condensed under an impervious stratum which might not be ignited and there form coal of different purities according to its degree of fluidity which would permit some of the clay to subside through it into the place from which it was sublimed  Some centuries afterwards another similar process might take place and either thicken the coalbed or produce a new claybed or marl or sand or deposit iron upon it according to the concomitant circumstances above mentioned  I do not mean to contend that a few masses of some materials may not have been rolled together by currents when the mountains were much more elevated than at present and in consequence the rivers broader and more rapid and the storms of rain and wind greater both in quantity and force Some gravelbeds may have been thus washed from the mountains and some white clay washed from morasses into valleys beneath them and some ochres of iron dissolved and again deposited by water and some calcareous depositions from water as the bank for instance on which stand the houses at Matlockbath but these are of small extent or consequence compared to the primitive rocks of granite or porpyhry which form the nucleus of the earth or to the immense strata of limestone which crust over the greatest part of this granite or porphyry or lastly to the very extensive beds of clay marl sandstone coal and iron  which were probably for many millions of years the only parts of our continents and islands which were then elevated above the level of the sea and which on that account became covered with vegetation and thence acquired their later or superincumbent strata which constitute what some have termed the new world  There is another source of clay and that of the finest kind from decomposed granite this is of a snowy white and mixed with shining particles of mica of this kind is an earth from the country of Cherokees Other kinds are from less pure lavas Mr Ferber asserts that the sulphurous steams from Mount Vesuvius convert the lava into clay  The lavas of the antient Solfatara volcano have been undoubtedly of a vitreous nature and these appear at present argillaceous Some fragments of this lava are but half or at one side changed into clay which either is viscid or ductile or hard and stoney Clays by fire are deprived of their coherent quality which cannot be restored to them by pulverization nor by humectation But the sulphureous Solfatara steams restore it as may be easily observed on the broken pots wherein they gather the sal ammoniac though very well baked and burnt at Naples they are mollified again by the acid steams into a viscid clay which keeps the sormer fireburnt colour  Travels in Italy p  NOTE XXIENAMELS  Smear'd her huge dragons with metallic hues  With golden purples and cobaltic blues  CANTO II l  THE fine bright purples or rose colours which we see on china cups are not producible with any other material except gold manganese indeed gives a purple but of a very different kind  In Europe the application of gold to these purposes appears to be of modern invention Cassius's discovery of the precipitate of gold by tin and the use of that precipitate for colouring glass and enamels are now generally known but though the precipitate with tin be more successful in producing the ruby glass or the colourless glass which becomes red by subsequent ignition the tin probably contributing to prevent the gold from separating which it is very liable to do during the fusion yet for enamels the precipitates made by alcaline salts answer equally well and give a finer red the colour produced by the tin precipitate being a bluish purple but with the others a rose red I am informed that some of our best artists prefer aurum fulminans mixing it before it has become dry with the white composition or enamel flux when once it is divided by the other matter it is ground with great safety and without the least danger of explosion whether moist or dry The colour is remarkably improved and brought forth by long grinding which accordingly makes an essential circumstance in the process  The precipitates of gold and the colcothar or other red preparations of iron are called  tender  colours The heat must be no greater than is just sufficient to make the enamel run upon the piece for if greater the colours will be destroyed or changed to a different kind When the vitreous matter has just become fluid it seems as if the coloured metallic calx remained barely  intermixed  with it like a coloured powder of exquisite tenuity suspended in water but by stronger fire the calx is  dissolved  and metallic colours are altered by  solution  in glass as well as in acids or alcalies  The Saxon mines have till very lately almost exclusively supplied the rest of Europe with cobalt or rather with its preparations zaffre and smalt for the exportation of the ore itself is there a capital crime Hungary Spain Sweden and some other parts of the continent are now said to afford cobalts equal to the Saxon and specimens have been discovered in our own island both in Cornwall and in Scotland but hitherto in no great quantity  Calces of cobalt and of copper differ very materially from those above mentioned in their application for colouring enamels In those the calx has previously acquired the intended colour a colour which bears a red heat without injury and all that remains is to fix it on the piece by a vitreous flux But the blue colour of cobalt and the green or bluish green of copper are  produced  by vitrification that is by  solution  in the glass and a strong fire is necessary for their perfection These calces therefore when mixed with the enamel flux are melted in crucibles once or oftener and the deep coloured opake glass thence resulting is ground into unpalpable powder and used for enamel One part of either of these calces is put to ten sixteen or twenty parts of the flux according to the depth of colour required The heat of the enamel kiln is only a full red such as is marked on Mr Wedgwood's thermometer degrees It is therefore necessary that the flux be so adjusted as to melt in that low heat The usual materials are flint or flintglass with a due proportion of redled or borax or both and sometimes a little tin calx to give opacity  Kaolin  is the name given by the Chinese to their porcelain clay and  petuntse  to the other ingredient in their China ware Specimens of both these have been brought into England and found to agree in quality with some of our own materials Kaolin is the very same with the clay called in Cornwall and the petuntse is a granite similar to the Cornish moorstone There are differences both in the Chinese petuntses and the English moorstones all of them contain micaceous and quartzy particles in greater or less quantity along with feltspat which last is the essential ingredient for the porcelain manufactory The only injurious material commonly found in them is iron which discolours the ware in proportion to its quantity and which our moorstones are perhaps more frequently tainted with than the Chinese Very fine porcelain has been made from English materials but the nature of the manufacture renders the process precarious and the profit hazardous for the semivitrification which constitutes porcelain is necessarily accompanied with a degree of softness or semifusion so that the vessels are liable to have their forms altered in the kiln or to run together with any accidental augmentations of the fire  The Portland Vase  NOTE XXIIPORTLAND VASE  Or bid Mortality rejoice or mourn  O'er the fine forms of Portland's mystic urn  CANTO II l  THE celebrated funereal vase long in possession of the Barberini family and lately purchased by the Duke of Portland for a thousand guineas is about ten inches high and six in diameter in the broadest part The figures are of most exquisite workmanship in bas relief of white opake glass raised on a ground of deep blue glass which appears black except when held against the light Mr Wedgwood is of opinion from many circumstances that the figures have been made by cutting away the external crust of white opake glass in the manner the finest cameo's have been produced and that it must thence have been the labour of a great many years Some antiquarians have placed the time of its production many centuries before the christian aera as sculpture was said to have been declining in respect to its excellence in the time of Alexander the Great See an account of the Barberini or Portland vase by M D'Hancarville and by Mr Wedgwood  Many opinions and conjectures have been published concerning the figures on this celebrated vase Having carefully examined one of Mr Wedgwood's beautiful copies of this wonderful production of art I shall add one more conjecture to the number  Mr Wedgwood has well observed that it does not seem probable that the Portland vase was purposely made for the ashes of any particular person deceased because many years must have been necessary for its production Hence it may be concluded that the subject of its embellishments is not private history but of a general nature This subject appears to me to be well chosen and the story to be finely told and that it represents what in antient times engaged the attention of philosophers poets and heroes I mean a part of the Eleusinian mysteries  These mysteries were invented in Aegypt and afterwards transferred to Greece and flourished more particularly at Athens which was at the same time the seat of the fine arts They consisted of scenical exhibitions representing and inculcating the expectation of a future life after death and on this account were encouraged by the government insomuch that the Athenian laws punished a discovery of their secrets with death Dr Warburton has with great learning and ingenuity shewn that the descent of Aeneas into hell described in the Sixth Book of Virgil is a poetical account of the representations of the future state in the Eleusinian mysteries Divine Legation Vol I p  And though some writers have differed in opinion from Dr Warburton on this subject because Virgil has introduced some of his own heroes into the Elysian fields as Deiphobus Palinurus and Dido in the same manner as Homer had done before him yet it is agreed that the received notions about a future state were exhibited in these mysteries and as these poets described those received notions they may be said as far as these religious doctrines were concerned to have described the mysteries  Now as these were emblematic exhibitions they must have been as well adapted to the purposes of sculpture as of poetry which indeed does not seem to have been uncommon since one compartment of figures in the sheild of Aeneas represented the regions of Tartarus Aen Lib X The procession of torches which according to M De St Croix was exhibited in these mysteries is still to be seen in basso relievo discovered by Spon and Wheler Memoires sur le Mysteres par De St Croix And it is very probable that the beautiful gem representing the marriage of Cupid and Psyche as described by Apulcus was originally descriptive of another part of the exhibitions in these mysteries though afterwards it became a common subject of antient art See Divine Legat Vol I p What subject could have been imagined so sublime for the ornaments of a funereal urn as the mortality of all things and their resuscitation Where could the designer be supplied with emblems for this purpose before the Christian aera but from the Eleusinian mysteries  The exhibitions of the mysteries were of two kinds those which the people were permitted to see and those which were only shewn to the initiated Concerning the latter Aristides calls them  the most shocking and most ravishing representations  And Stoboeus asserts that the initiation into the grand mysteries exactly resembles death Divine Legat Vol I p and p And Virgil in his entrance to the shades below amongst other things of terrible form mentions death Aen VI This part of the exhibition seems to be represented in one of the compartments of the Portland vase  Three figures of exquisite workmanship are placed by the side of a ruined column whose capital is fallen off and lies at their feet with other disjointed stones they sit on loose piles of stone beneath a tree which has not the leaves of any evergreen of this climate but may be supposed to be an elm which Virgil places near the entrance of the infernal regions and adds that a dream was believed to dwell under every leaf of it Aen VI l In the midst of this group reclines a female figure in a dying attitude in which extreme languor is beautifully represented in her hand is an inverted torch an antient emblem of extinguished life the elbow of the same arm resting on a stone supports her as she sinks while the other hand is raised and thrown over her drooping head in some measure sustaining it and gives with great art the idea of fainting lassitude On the right of her sits a man and on the left a woman both supporting themselves on their arms as people are liable to do when they are thinking intensely They have their backs towards the dying figure yet with their faces turned towards her as if seriously contemplating her situation but without stretching out their hands to assist her  This central figure then appears to me to be an hieroglyphic or Eleusinian emblem of MORTAL LIFF that is the lethum or death mentioned by Virgil amongst the terrible things exhibited at the beginning of the mysteries The inverted torch shews the figure to be emblematic if it had been designed to represent a real person in the act of dying there had been no necessity for the expiring torch as the dying figure alone would have been sufficiently intelligibleit would have been as absurd as to have put an inverted torch into the hand of a real person at the time of his expiring Besides if this  The first Compartment  The second Compartment  figure had represented a real dying person would not the other figures or one of them at least have stretched out a hand to support her to have eased her fall among loose stones or to have smoothed her pillow These circumstances evince that the figure is an emblem and therefore could not be a representation of the private history of any particular family or event  The man and woman on each side of the dying figure must be considered as emblems both from their similarity of situation and dress to the middle figure and their being grouped along with it These I think are hieroglyphic or Eleusinian emblems of HUMANKIND with their backs toward the dying figure of MORTAL LIFE unwilling to associate with her yet turning back their serious and attentive countenances curious indeed to behold yet sorry to contemplate their latter end These figures bring strongly to one's mind the Adam and Eve of sacred writ whom some have supposed to have been allegorical or hieroglyphic persons of Aegyptian origin but of more antient date amongst whom I think is Dr Warburton According to this opinion Adam and Eve were the names of two hieroglyphic figures representing the early state of mankind Abel was the name of an hieroglyphic figure representing the age of pasturage and Cain the name of another hieroglyphic symbol representing the age of agriculture at which time the uses of iron were discovered And as the people who cultivated the earth and built houses would increase in numbers much faster by their greater production of food they would readily conquer or destroy the people who were sustained by pasturage which was typified by Cain slaying Abel  On the other compartment of this celebrated vase is exhibited an emblem of immortality the representation of which was well known to constitute a very principal part of the shews at the Eleusinian mysteries as Dr Warburton has proved by variety of authority The habitation of spirits or ghosts after death was supposed by the antients to be placed beneath the earth where Pluto reigned and dispensed rewards or punishments Hence the first figure in this group is of the MANES or GHOST who having passed through an open portal is descending into a dusky region pointing his toe with timid and unsteady step feeling as it were his way in the gloom This portal Aeneas enters which is described by Virgilpatet atri janua ditis Aen VI l as well as the easy descentfacilis descensus Averni Ib The darkness at the entrance to the shades is humorously described by Lucian Div Legat Vol I p And the horror of the gates of hell was in the time of Homer become a proverb Achilles says to Ulysses "I hate a liar worse than the gates of hell" the same expression is used in Isaiah ch xxxviii v The MANES or GHOST appears lingering and fearful and wishes to drag after him a part of his mortal garment which however adheres to the side of the portal through which he has passed The beauty of this allegory would have been expressed by Mr Pope by "We feel the ruling passion strong in death"  A little lower down in the group the manes or ghost is received by a beautiful female a symbol of IMMORTAL LIFE This is evinced by her fondling between her knees a large and playful serpent which from its annually renewing its external skin has from great antiquity even as early as the fable of Prometheus been esteemed an emblem of  renovated youth The story of the serpent acquiring immortal life from the ass of Prometheus who carried it on his back is told in Bacon's Works Vol V p Quarto edit Lond For a similar purpose a serpent was wrapped round the large hieroglyphic egg in the temple of Dioscuri as an emblem of the renewal of life from a state of death Bryant's Mythology Vol II p sec edit On this account also the serpent was an attendant on Aesculapius which seems to have been the name of the hieroglyphic figure of medicine This serpent shews this figure to be an emblem as the torch shewed the central figure of the other compartment to be an emblem hence they agreeably correspond and explain each other one representing MORTAL LIFE and the other IMMORTAL LIFE  This emblematic figure of immortal life sits down with her feet towards the figure of Pluto but turning back her face towards the timid ghost she stretches forth her hand and taking hold of his elbow supports his tottering steps as well as encourages him to advance both which circumstances are thus with wonderful ingenuity brought to the eye At the same time the spirit loosely lays his hand upon her arm as one walking in the dark would naturally do for the greater certainty of following his conductress while the general part of the symbol of IMMORTAL LIFE being turned toward the figure of Pluto shews that she is leading the phantom to his realms  In the Pamphili gardens at Rome Perseus in assisting Andromeda to descend from the rock takes hold of her elbow to steady or support her step and she lays her hand loosely on his arm as in this figure Admir Roman Antiq  The figure of PLUTO can not be mistaken as is agreed by most of the writers who have mentioned this vase his grisley beard and his having one foot buried in the earth denotes the infernal monarch He is placed at the lowest part of the group and resting his chin on his hand and his arm upon his knee receives the strangerspirit with inquisitive attention it was before observed that when people think attentively they naturally rest their bodies in some easy attitude that more animal power may be employed on the thinking faculty In this group of figures there is great art shewn in giving an idea of a descending plain viz from earth to Elysium and yet all the figures are in reality on an horizontal one This wonderful deception is produced first by the descending step of the manes or ghost secondly by the arm of the sitting figure of immortal life being raised up to receive him as he descends and lastly by Pluto having one foot sunk into the earth  There is yet another figure which is concerned in conducting the manes or ghost to the realms of Pluto and this is LOVE He precedes the descending spirit on expanded wings lights him with his torch and turning back his beautiful countenance beckons him to advance The antient God of love was of much higher dignity than the modern Cupid He was the first that came out of the great egg of night Hesiod Theog V CXX Bryant's Mythol Vol II p and is said to possess the keys of the sky sea and earth As he therefore led the way into this life he seems to constitute a proper emblem for leading the way to a suture life See Bacon's works Vol I p and Vol III p Quarto edit  The introduction of love into this part of the mysteries requires a little further explanation The Psyche of the Aegyptians was one of their most favourite emblems and represented the soul or a future life it was originally no other than the aurelia or butterfly but in after times was represented by a lovely female child with the beautiful wings of that insect The aurelia after its first stage as an eruca or caterpillar lies for a season in a manner dead and is inclosed in a sort of coffin in this state of darkness it remains all the winter but at the return of spring it bursts its bonds and comes out with new life and in the most beautiful attire The Aegyptians thought this a very proper picture of the soul of man and of the immortality to which it aspired But as this was all owing to divine Love of which EROS was an emblem we find this person frequently introduced as a concomitant of the soul in general or Psyche Bryant's Mythol Vol II p EROS or divine Love is for the same reason a proper attendant on the manes or soul after death and much contributes to tell the story that is to shew that a soul or manes is designed by the descending figure From this figure of Love M D'Hancarville imagines that Orpheus and Eurydice are typified under the figure of the manes and immortal life as above described It may be sufficient to answer first that Orpheus is always represented with a lyre of which there are prints of four different gems in Spence's Polymetis and Virgil so describes him Aen VI cytharâ fretus And secondly that it is absurd to suppose that Eurydice was fondling and playing with a serpent that had slain her Add to this that Love seems to have been an inhabitant of the infernal regions as exhibited in the mysteries for Claudian who treats more openly of the Eleusinian mysteries when they were held in less veneration invokes the deities to disclose to him their secrets and amongst other things by what torch Love softens Pluto  Dii quibus in numerum c  Vos mihi sacrarum penetralia pandite rerum  Et vestri secreta poli quâ lampade Ditem  Flexit amor  In this compartment there are two trees whose branches spread over the figures one of them has smoother leaves like some evergreens and might thence be supposed to have some allusion to immortality but they may perhaps have been designed only as ornaments or to relieve the figures or because it was in groves where these mysteries were originally celebrated Thus Homer speaks of the woods of Proserpine and mentions many trees in Tartarus as presenting their fruits to Tantalus Virgil speaks of the pleasant groves of Elysium and in Spence's Polymetis there are prints of two antient gems one of Orpheus charming Cerberus with his lyre and the other of Hercules binding him in a cord each of them standing by a tree Polymet p As however these trees have all different foliage so clearly marked by the artist they may have had specific meanings in the exhibitions of the mysteries which have not reached posterity of this kind seem to have been the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life in sacred writ both which must have been emblematic or allegorical The masks  hanging to the handles of the vase seem to indicate that there is a concealed meaning in the figures besides their general appearance And the priestess at the bottom which I come now to describe seems to shew this concealed meaning to be of the sacred or Eleusinian kind  The figure on the bottom of the vase is on a larger scale than the others and less finely finished and less elevated and as this bottom part was afterwards cemented to the upper part it might be executed by another artist for the sake of expedition but there seems no reason to suppose that it was not originally designed for the upper part of it as some have conjectured As the mysteries of Ceres were celebrated by female priests for Porphyrius says the antients called the priestesses of Ceres Melissai or bees which were emblems of chastity Div Leg Vol I p And as in his Satire against the sex Juvenal says that few women are worthy to be priestesses of Ceres Sat VI the figure at the bottom of the vase would seem to represent a PRIESTESS or HIEROPHANT whose office it was to introduce the initiated and point out to them and explain the exhibitions in the mysteries and to exclude the uninitiated calling out to them " Far far retire ye profane" and to guard the secrets of the temple Thus the introductory hymn sung by the hierophant according to Eusebius begins "I will declare a secret to the initiated but let the doors be shut against the profane" Div Leg Vol I p The priestess or hierophant appears in this figure with a close hood and dressed in linen which sits close about her except a light cloak which flutters in the wind Wool as taken from slaughtered animals was esteemed profane by the priests of Aegypt who were always dressed in linen Apuleus p Div Leg Vol I p Thus Eli made for Samuel a linen ephod Samuel i  Secrecy was the foundation on which all mysteries rested when publicly known they ceased to be mysteries hence a discovery of them was not only punished with death by the Athenian law but in other countries a disgrace attended the breach of a solemn oath The priestess in the figure before us has her finger pointing to her lips as an emblem of silence There is a figure of Harpocrates who was of Aegyptian origin the same as Orus with the lotus on his head and with his finger pointing to his lips not pressed upon them in Bryant's Mythol Vol II p and another female figure standing on a lotus as if just risen from the Nile with her finger in the same attitude these seem to have been representations or emblems of male and female priests of the secret mysteries As these sort of emblems were frequently changed by artists for their more elegant exhibition it is possible the foliage over the head of this figure may bear some analogy to the lotus above mentioned  This figure of secrecy seems to be here placed with great ingenuity as a caution to the initiated who might understand the meaning of the emblems round the vase not to divulge it And this circumstance seems to account for there being no written explanation extant and no tradition concerning these beautiful figures handed down to us along with them  Another explanation of this figure at the bottom of the vase would seem to confirm the idea that the basso relievos round its sides are representations of a part of the  The  Bottom of the Vase  mysteries I mean that it is the head of ATIS Lucian says that Atis was a young man of Phrygia of uncommon beauty that he dedicated a temple in Syria to Rhea or Cybele and first taught her mysteries to the Lydians Phrygians and Samothracians which mysteries he brought from India He was afterwards made an eunuch by Rhea and lived like a woman and assumed a feminine habit and in that garb went over the world teaching her ceremonies and mysteries Dict par M Danet art Atis As this figure is covered with clothes while those on the sides of the vase are naked and has a Phrygian cap on the head and as the form and features are so soft that it is difficult to say whether it be a male or female figure there is reason to conclude that it has reference to some particular person of some particular country that this person is Atis the first great hierophant or teacher of mysteries to whom M De la Chausse says the figure itself bears a resemblance Museo Capitol Tom IV p  In the Museum Etruscum Vol I plate there is the head of Atis with feminine features clothed with a Phrygian cap and rising from very broad foliage placed on a kind of term supported by the paw of a lion Goreus in his explanation of the figure says that it is placed on a lion's foot because that animal was sacred to Cybele and that it rises from very broad leaves because after he became an eunuch he determined to dwell in the groves Thus the foliage as well as the cap and feminine features confirm the idea of this figure at the bottom of the vase representing the head of Atis the first great hierophant and that the figures on the sides of the vase are emblems from the antient mysteries  I beg leave to add that it does not appear to have been uncommon amongst the antients to put allegorical figures on funeral vases In the Pamphili palace at Rome there is an elaborate representation of Life and of Death on an antient sarcophagus In the first Prometheus is represented making man and Minerva is placing a butterfly or the foul upon his head In the other compartment Love extinguishes his torch in the bosom of the dying figure and is receiving the butterfly or Psyche from him with a great number of complicated emblematic figures grouped in very bad taste Admir Roman Antiq  NOTE XXIIICOAL  Whence sable Coal his massy couch extends  And stars of gold the sparkling Pyrite blends  CANTO II l  TO elucidate the formation of coalbeds I shall here describe a fountain of fossil tar or petroleum discovered lately near Colebrook Dale in Shropshire the particulars of which were sent me by Dr Robert Darwin of Shrewsbury  About a mile and a half below the celebrated ironbridge constructed by the late Mr DARBY near Colebrook Dale on the east side of the river Severn as the workmen in October were making a subterranean canal into the mountain for the more easy acquisition and conveyance of the coals which lie under it they found an oozing of liquid bitumen or petroleum and as they proceeded further cut through small cavities of different sizes from which the bitumen issued From ten to fifteen barrels of this fossil tar each barrel containing thirtytwo gallons were at first collected in a day which has since however gradually diminished in quantity so that at present the product is about seven barrels in fourteen days  The mountain into which this canal enters consists of siliceous sand in which however a few marine productions apparently in their recent state have been found and are now in the possession of Mr WILLIAM REYNOLDS of Ketly Bank About three hundred yards from the entrance into the mountain and about twentyeight yards below the surface of it the tar is found oozing from the sandrock above into the top and sides of the canal  Beneath the level of this canal a shaft has been sunk through a grey argillaceous substance called in this country clunch which is said to be a pretty certain indication of coal beneath this lies a stratum of coal about two or three inches thick of an inferior kind yielding little flame in burning and leaving much ashes below this is a rock of a harder texture and beneath this are found coals of an excellent quality for the purpose of procuring which with greater facility the canal or horizontal aperture is now making into the mountain July  Beneath these coals in some places is found salt water in other parts of the adjacent country there are beds of ironstone which also contain some bitumen in a less fluid state and which are about on a level with the new canal into which the fossil tar oozes as above described  There are many interesting circumstances attending the situation and accompaniments of this fountain of fossil tar tending to develop the manner of its production As the canal passing into the mountain runs over the beds of coals and under the reservoir of petroleum it appears that a  natural distillation  of this fossil in the bowels of the earth must have taken place at some early period of the world similar to the artificial distillation  of coal which has many years been carried on in this place on a smaller scale above ground When this reservoir of petroleum was cut into the slowness of its exsudation into the canal was not only owing to its viscidity but to the pressure of the atmosphere or to the necessity there was that air should at the same time insinuate itself into the small cavities from which the petroleum descended The existence of such a distillation at some antient time is confirmed by the thin stratum of coal beneath the canal which covers the hard rock having been deprived of its fossil oil so as to burn without flame and thus to have become a natural coak or fossil charcoal while the petroleum distilled from it is found in the cavities of the rock above it  There are appearances in other places which favour this idea of the natural distillation of petroleum thus at Matlock in Derbyshire a hard bitumen is found adhering to the spar in the clefts of the limerocks in the form of round drops about the size of peas which could perhaps only be deposited there in that form by sublimation  The second deduction which offers itself is that these beds of coal have been  exposed to a considerable degree of heat  since the petroleum above could not be separated as far as we know by any other means and that the good quality of the coals beneath the hard rock was owing to the impermeability of this rock to the bituminous vapour and to its pressure being too great to permit its being removed by the elasticity of that vapour Thus from the degree of heat the degree of pressure and the permeability of the superincumbent strata many of the phenomena attending coalbeds receive an easy explanation which much accords with the ingenious theory of the earth by Dr Hutton Trans of Edinb Vol I  In some coal works the fusion of the strata of coal has been so slight that there remains the appearance of ligneus fibres and the impression of leaves as at Bovey near Exeter and even seeds of vegetables of which I have had specimens from the collieries near Polesworth in Warwickshire In some where the heat was not very intense and the incumbent stratum not permeable to vapour the fossil oil has only risen to the upper part of the coalbed and has rendered that much more inflammable than the lower parts of it as in the collieries near Beaudesert the seat of the EARL OF UXBRIDGE in Staffordshire where the upper stratum is a perfect cannel or candlecoal and the lower one of an inferior quality Over the coalbeds near Sir H HARPUR's house in Derbyshire a thin lamina of asphaltum is found in some places near the surface of the earth which would seem to be from a distillation of petroleum from the coals below the more fluid part of which had in process of time exhaled or been consolidated by its absorption of air In other coalworks the upper part of the stratum is of a worse kind than the lower one as at Alfreton and Denbigh in Derbyshire owing to the supercumbent stratum having permitted the exhalation of a great part of the petroleum whilst at Widdrington in Northumberland there is first a seam of coal about six inches thick of no value which lies under about four fathom of clay beneath this is a white freestone then a hard stone which the workmen there call a whin then two fathoms of clay then another white stone and under that a vein of coals three feet nine inches  thick of a similar nature to the Newcastle coal Phil Trans Abridg Vol VI plate II p The similitude between the circumstances of this colliery and of the coal beneath the fountain of tar above described renders it highly probable that this upper thin seam of coal has suffered a similar distillation and that the inflammable part of it had either been received into the clay above in the form of sulphur which when burnt in the open air would produce alum or had been dissipated for want of a receiver where it could be condensed The former opinion is perhaps in this cafe more probable as in some other coalbeds of which I have procured accounts the surface of the coal beneath clunch or clay is of an inferior quality as at West Hallum in Nottinghamshire The clunch probably from hence acquires its inflammable part which on calcination becomes vitriolic acid I gathered pieces of clunch converted partially into alum at a colliery near Bilston where the ground was still on fire a few years ago  The heat which has thus pervaded the beds of morass seems to have been the effect of the fermentation of their vegetable materials as new hay sometimes takes fire even in such very small masses from the sugar it contains and seems hence not to have been attended with any expulsion of lava like the deeper craters of volcanos situated in beds of granite  The marine shells found in the loose sandrock above this reservoir of petroleum and the coalbeds beneath it together with the existence of seasalt beneath these coals prove that these coal beds have been  at the bottom of the sea  during some remote period of time and were afterwards raised into their present situation by subterraneous expansions of vapour This doctrine is further supported by the marks of violence which some coalbeds received at the time they were raised out of the sea as in the collieries at Mendip in Somersetshire In these there are seven strata of coals equitant upon each other with beds of clay and stone intervening amongst which clay are found shells and fern branches In one part of this hill the strata are disjoined and a quantity of heterogeneous substances fill up the chasm which disjoins them on one side of this chasm the seven strata of coal are seen corresponding in respect to their reciprocal thickness and goodness with the seven strata on the other side of the cavity except that they have been elevated several yards higher Phil Trans No abridg Vol V p  The cracks in the coalbed near Ticknall in Derbyshire and in the sandstone rock over it in both of which specimens of leadore and spar are found confirm this opinion of their having been forcibly raised up by subterraneous fires Over the colliery at Brownhills near Lichfield there is a stratum of gravel on the surface of the ground which may be adduced as another proof to shew that those coals had some time been beneath the sea or the bed of a river Nevertheless these arguments only apply to the collieries above mentioned which are few compared with those which bear no marks of having been immersed in the sea  On the other hand the production of coals from morasses as described in note XX is evinced from the vegetable matters frequently found in them and in the strata over them as fernleaves in nodules of ironore and from the bogshells or fresh water  muscles sometimes found over them of both which I have what I believe to be specimens and is further proved from some parts of these beds being only in part transformed to coal and the other part still retaining not only the form but some of the properties of wood specimens of which are not unfrequent in the cabinets of the curious procured from Loch Neigh in Ireland from Bovey near Exeter and other places and from a famous cavern called the Temple of the Devil near the town of Altorf in Franconia at the foot of a mountain covered with pine and savine in which are found large coals resembling trees of ebony which are so far mineralized as to be heavy and compact and so to effloresce with pyrites in some parts as to crumble to pieces yet from other parts white ashes are produced on calcination from which  fixed alcali  is procured which evinces their vegetable origin Dict Raisonné art Charbon To these may be added another argument from the oil which is distilled from coals and which is analogous to vegetable oil and does not exist in any bodies truly mineral Keir's Chemical Dictionary art Bitumen  Whence it would appear that though most collieries with their attendant strata of clay sandstone and iron were formed on the places where the vegetables grew from which they had their origin yet that other collections of vegetable matter were washed down from eminences by currents of waters into the beds of rivers or the neighbouring seas and were there accumulated at different periods of time and underwent a great degree of heat from their fermentation in the same manner as those beds of morass which had continued on the plains where they were produced And that by this fermentation many of them had been raised from the ocean with sand and seashells over them and others from the beds of rivers with accumulations of gravel upon them  For the purpose of bringing this history of the products of morasses more distinctly to the eye of the reader I shall here subjoin two or three accounts of sinking or boring for coals out of above twenty which I have procured from various places though the terms are not very intelligible being the language of the overseers of coalworks    Whitfield mine  near the Pottery in Staffordshire Soil foot brickclay feet shale metal which is hard

bassetting when the whole mass was ignited by its fermentation it is probable that the inflammable part of some strata might thus more easily escape than of others in the form of vapour as dews are known to slide between such strata in the production of springs which accounts for some coalbeds being so much worse than others See note XX  NOTE XXIVGRANITE  Climb the rude steeps the Granitecliffs surround  CANTO II l  THE lowest stratum of the earth which human labour has arrived to is granite and of this likewise consists the highest mountains of the world It is known under variety of names according to some difference in its appearance or composition but is now generally considered by philosophers as a species of lava if it contains quartz feltspat and mica in distinct crystals it is called granite which is found in Cornwall in rocks and in loose stones in the gravel near Drayton in Shropshire in the road towards Newcastle If these parts of the composition be less distinct or if only two of them be visible to the eye it is termed porphyry trap whinstone moorstone slate And if it appears in a regular angular form it is called basaltes The affinity of these bodies has lately been further well established by Dr Beddoes in the Phil Trans Vol LXXX  These are all esteemed to have been volcanic productions that have undergone different degrees of heat it is well known that in Papin's digester water may be made red hot by confinement and will then dissolve many bodies which otherwise are little or not at all acted upon by it From hence it may be conceived that under immense pressure of superincumbent materials and by great heat these masses of lava may have undergone a kind of aqueous solution without any tendency to vitrification and might thence have a power of crystallization whence all the varieties above mentioned from the different proportion of the materials or the different degrees of heat they may have undergone in this aqueous solution And that the uniformity of the mixture of the original earths as of lime argil silex magnesia and barytes which they contain was owing to their boiling together a longer or shorter time before their elevation into mountains See note XIX art  The seat of volcanos seems to be principally if not entirely in these strata of granite as many of them are situated on granite mountains and throw up from time to time sheets of lava which run down over the preceeding strata from the same origin and in this they seem to differ from the heat which has separated the clay coal and sand in morasses which would appear to have risen from a kind of fermentation and thus to have pervaded the whole mass without any expuition of lava  A sketch of a supposed Section of the Earth in respect of the disposition of the Strata over each other without regard to their proportions or number  All the lavas from Vesuvius contain one fourth part of iron Kirwan's Min and all the five primitive earths viz calcareous argillaceous siliceous barytic and magnesian earths which are also evidently produced now daily from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies What is to be thence concluded Has the granite stratum in very antient times been produced like the present calcareous and siliceous masses according to the ingenious theory of Dr Hutton who says new continents are now forming at the bottom of the sea to rise in their turn and that thus the terraqueous globe has been and will be eternal Or shall we suppose that this internal heated mass of granite which forms the nucleus of the earth was a part of the body of the sun before it was separated by an explosion Or was the fun originally a planet inhabited like ours and a satellite to some other greater fun which has long been extinguished by diffusion of its light and around which the present sun continues to revolve according to a conjecture of the celebrated Mr Herschell and which conveys to the mind a most sublime idea of the progressive and increasing excellence of the works of the Creator of all things  For the more easy comprehension of the facts and conjectures concerning the situation and production of the various strata of the earth I shall here subjoin a supposed section of the globe but without any attempt to give the proportions of the parts or the number of them but only their respective situation over each other and a geological recapitulation  GEOLOGICAL RECAPITULATION  The earth was projected along with the other primary planets from the sun which is supposed to be on fire only on its surface emitting light without much internal heat like a ball of burning camphor  The rotation of the earth round its axis was occasioned by its greater friction or adhesion to one side of the cavity from which it was ejected and from this rotation it acquired its spheroidical form As it cooled in its ascent from the sun its nucleus became harder and its attendant vapours were condensed forming the ocean  The masses or mountains of granite porphery basalt and stones of similar structure were a part of the original nucleus of the earth or consist of volcanic productions since formed  On this nucleus of granite and basaltes thus covered by the ocean were formed the calcareous beds of limestone marble chalk spar from the exuviae of marine animals with the flints or chertz which accompany them And were stratified by their having been formed at different and very distant periods of time  The whole terraqueous globe was burst by central fires islands and continents were raised consisting of granite or lava in some parts and of limestone in others and great vallies were sunk into which the ocean retired  During these central earthquakes the moon was ejected from the earth causing new tides and the earth's axis suffered some change in its inclination and its rotatory motion was retarded  On some parts of these islands and continents of granite or limestone were gradually produced extensive morasses from the recrements of vegetables and of land animals and from these morasses heated by fermentation were produced clay marle sandstone coal iron with the bases of variety of acids all which were stratified by their having been formed at different and very distant periods of time  In the elevation of the mountains very numerous and deep fissures necessarily were produced In these fissures many of the metals are formed partly from descending materials and partly from ascending ones raised in vapour by subterraneous fires In the fissures of granite or porphery quartz is formed in the fissures of limestone calcareous spar is produced  During these first great volcanic fires it is probable the atmosphere was either produced or much increased a process which is perhaps now going on in the moon Mr Herschell having discovered a volcanic crater three miles broad burning on her disk  The summits of the new mountains were cracked into innumerable lozenges by the cold dews or snows falling upon them when red hot From these summits which were then twice as high as at present cubes and lozenges of granite and basalt and quartz in some countries and of marble and flints in others descended gradually into the valleys and were rolled together in the beds of rivers which were then so large as to occupy the whole valleys which they now only intersect and produced the great beds of gravel of which many valleys consist  In several parts of the earth's surface subsequent earthquakes from the fermentation of morasses have at different periods of time deranged the position of the matters above described Hence the gravel which was before in the beds of rivers has in some places been raised into mountains along with clay and coal strata which were formed from morasses and washed down from eminences into the beds of rivers or the neighbouring seas and in part raised again with gravel or marine shells over them but this has only obtained in few places compared with the general distribution of such materials Hence there seem to have existed two sources of earthquakes which have occurred at great distance of time from each other one from the granite beds in the central parts of the earth and the other from the morasses on its surface All the subsequent earthquakes and volcanos of modern days compared with these are of small extent and insignificant effect  Besides the argillaceous sandstone produced from morasses which is stratified with clay and coal and iron other great beds of siliceous sand have been formed in the sea by the combination of an unknown acid from morasses and the calcareous matters of the ocean  The warm waters which are found in many countries are owing to steam arising from great depths through the fissures of limestone or lava elevated by subterranean fires and condensed between the strata of the hills over them and not from any decomposition of pyrites or manganese near the surface of the earth  The columns of basaltes have been raised by the congelation or expansion of granite beds in the act of cooling from their semivitreous fusion  NOTE XXVEVAPORATION  Aquatic nymphs you lead with viewless march  The winged vapour up the aerial arch  CANTO III  l  THE atmosphere will dissolve a certain quantity of moisture as a chemical menstruum even when it is much below the freezing point as appears from the diminution of ice suspended in frosty air but a much greater quantity of water is evaporated and suspended in the air by means of heat which is perhaps the universal cause of fluidity for water is known to boil with less heat in vacuo which is a proof that it will evaporate faster in vacuo and that the air therefore rather hinders than promotes its evaporation in higher degrees of heat The quick evaporation occasioned in vacuo by a small degree of heat is agreeably seen in what is termed a pulseglass which consists of an exhausted tube of glass with a bulb at each end of it and with about two thirds of the cavity filled with alcohol in which the spirit is instantly seen to boil by the heat of the fingerend applied on a bubble of steam in the lower bulb and is condensed again in the upper bulb by the least conceivable comparative coldness  Another circumstance evincing that heat is the principal cause of evaporation is that at the time of water being converted into steam a great quantity of heat is taken away from the neighbouring bodies If a thermometer be repeatedly dipped in ether or in rectified spirit of wine and exposed to a blast of air to expedite the evaporation by perpetually removing the saturated air from it the thermometer will presently sink below freezing This warmth taken from the ambient bodies at the time of evaporation by the steam is again given out when the steam is condensed into water Hence the water in a wormtub during distillation so soon becomes hot and hence the warmth accompanying the descent of rain in cold weather  The third circumstance shewing that heat is the principal cause of evaporation is that some of the steam becomes again condensed when any part of the heat is withdrawn Thus when warmer southwest winds replete with moisture succeed the colder northeast winds all bodies that are dense and substantial as stone walls brick floors c absorb some of the heat from the passing air and its moisture becomes precipitated on them while the northeast winds become warmer on their arrival in this latitude and are thence disposed to take up more moisture and are termed drying winds  Heat seems to be the principal cause of the solution of many other bodies as common salt or blue vitriol dissolved in water which when exposed to severe cold are precipitated or carried to the part of the water last frozen this I observed in a phial filled with a solution of blue vitriol which was frozen the phial was burst the ice  thawed and a blue column of cupreous vitriol was left standing upright on the bottom of the broken glass as described in note XIX  II Hence water may either be dissolved in air and may then be called an aerial solution of water or it may be dissolved in the fluid matter of heat according to the theory of M Lavoisier and may then be called steam In the former case it is probable there are many other vapours which may precipitate it as marine acid gas or fluor acid gas So alcaline gas and acid gas dissolved in air precipitate each other nitrous gas precipitates vital air from its azote and inflammable gas mixed with vital air ignited by an electric spark either produces or precipitates the water in both of them Are there any subtle exhalations occasionally diffused in the atmosphere which may thus cause rain  But as water is perhaps many hundred times more soluble in the fluid matter of heat than in air I suppose the education of this heat by whatever means it is occasioned is the principal cause of devaporation Thus if a region of air is brought from a warmer climate as the S W winds it becomes cooled by its contact with the earth in this latitude and parts with so much of its moisture as was dissolved in the quantity of calorique or heat which it now looses but retains that part which was suspended by its attraction to the particles of air or by aerial solution even in the most severe frosts  A second immediate cause of rain is a stream of N E wind descending from a superior current of air and mixing with the warmer S W wind below or the reverse of this viz a superior current of S W wind mixing with an inferior one of N E wind in both these cases the whole heaven becomes instantly clouded and the moisture contained in the S W current is precipitated This cause of devaporation has been ingeniously explained by Dr Hutton in the Transact of Edinburgh Vol I and seems to arise from this circumstance the particles of air of the N E wind educe part of the heat from the S W wind and therefore the water which was dissolved by that quantity of  heat  is precipitated all the other part of the water which was suspended by its attraction to the particles of air or dissolved in the remainder of the heat continues unprecipitated  A third method by which a region of air becomes cooled and in consequence deposits much of its moisture is from the mechanical expansion of air when part of the pressure is taken off In this case the expanded air becomes capable of receiving or attracting more of the matter of heat into its interstices and the vapour which was previously dissolved in this heat is deposited as is seen in the receiver of an airpump which becomes dewy as the air within becomes expanded by the education of part of it See note VII Hence when the mercury in the barometer sinks without a change of the wind the air generally becomes colder See note VII on Elementary Heat And it is probably from the varying pressure of the incumbent air that in summer days small black clouds are often thus suddenly produced and again soon vanish See a paper in Philos Trans Vol LXXVIII intitled Frigorific Experiments on the Mechanical Expansion of Air  Another portion of atmospheric water may possibly be held in solution by the electric fluid since in thunder storms a precipitation of the water seems to be either the cause or the consequence of the eduction of the electricity But it appears more probable that the water is condensed into clouds by the eduction of its heat and that then the surplus of electricity prevents their coalescence into larger drops which immediately succeeds the departure of the lightning  The immediate cause why the barometer sinks before rain is first because a region of warm air brought to us in the place of the cold air which it had displaced must weigh lighter both specifically and absolutely if the height of the warm atmosphere be supposed to be equal to that or the preceeding cold one And secondly after the drops of rain begin to fall in any column of air that column becomes lighter the falling drops only adding to the prssure of the air in proportion to the resistance which they meet with in passing through that fluid  If we could suppose water to be dissolved in air without heat or in very low degrees of heat I suppose the air would become heavier as happens in many chemical solution but if water dissolved in the matter of heat or calorique be mixed with an aerial solutions of water there can be no doubt but an atmosphere consisting of such a mixture must become lighter in proportion to the quantity of calorique On the same circumstance depends the visible vapour produced from the breath of animals in cold weather or from a boiling kettle the particles of cold air with which it is mixed steal a part of its heat and become themselves raised in temperature whence part of the water is precipitated in visible vapour which if in great quantity sinks to the ground if in small quantity and the surrounding air is not previously saturated it spreads itself till it becomes again dissolved  NOTE XXVISPRINGS  Your lucid bands condense with fingers chill  The blue mist hovering round the gelid hill  CANTO III  l  THE surface of the earth consists of strata many of which were formed originally beneath the sea the mountains were afterwards forced up by subterraneous fires as appears from the fillures in the rocks of which they consist the quantity of volcanic productions all over the world and the numerous remains of craters of volcanos in mountainous countries Hence the strata which compose the sides of mountains lie slanting downwards and one or two or more of the external strata not reaching to the summit when the mountain was raised up the second or third stratum or a more inferior one is there exposed to day this may be well represented by forceably thrusting a blunt instrument through several sheets of paper a bur will stand up with the lowermost sheet standing highest in the center of it On this uppermost stratum which is colder as it is more elevated the dews are condensed in large quantities and sliding down pass under the first or second or third stratum which compose the sides of the hill and either form a morass below or a weeping rock by oozing out in numerous places or many of these less currents meeting together burst out in a more copious rill  The summits of mountains are much colder than the plains in their vicinity owing to several causes Their being in a manner insulated or cut off from the common heat of the earth which is always of degrees and perpetually counteracts the effects of external cold beneath that degree From their surfaces being larger in proportion to their solid contents and hence their heat more expeditiously carried away by the evermoving atmosphere The increasing rarity of the air as the mountain rises All those bodies which conduct electricity well or ill conduct the matter of heat likewise well or ill See note VII Atmospheric air is a bad conductor of electricity and thence confines it on the body where it is accumulated but when it is made very rare as in the exhausted receiver the electric aura passes away immediately to any distance The same circumstance probably happens in respect to heat which is thus kept by the denser air on the plains from escaping but is dissipated on the hills where the air is thinner As the currents of air rise up the sides of mountains they become mechanically rarefied the pressure of the incumbent column lessening as they ascend Hence the expanding air absorbs heat from the mountain as it ascends as explained in note VII There is another and perhaps more powerful cause I suspect which may occasion the great cold on mountains and in the higher parts of the atmosphere and which has not yet been attended to I mean that the fluid matter of heat may prodably gravitate round the earth and form an atmosphere on its surface mixed with the aerial atmosphere which may diminish or become rarer as it recedes from the earth's surface in a greater proportion than the air diminishes  The great condensation of moisture on the summits of hills has another cause which is the dashing of moving clouds against them in misty days this is often seen to have great effect on plains where an eminent tree by obstructing the mist as it moves along shall have a much greater quantity of moisture drop from its leaves than falls at the same time on the ground in its vicinity Mr White in his History of Selborne gives an account of a large tree so situated from which a stream flowed during a moving mist so as to fill the cartruts in a lane otherwise not very moist and ingeniously adds that trees planted about ponds of stagnant water contribute much by these means to supply the reservoir The spherules which constitute a mist or cloud are kept from uniting by so small a power that a little agitation against the leaves of a tree or the greater attraction of a flat moist surface condenses or precipitates them  If a leaf has its surface moistened and particles of water separate from each other as in a mist be brought near the moistened surface of a leaf each particle will be attracted more by that plain surface of water on the leaf than it can be by the surrounding particles of the mist because globules only attract each other in one point whereas a plain attracts a globule by a greater extent of its surface  The common cold springs are thus formed on elevated grounds by the condensed vapours and hence are stronger when the nights are cold after hot days in spring than even in the wet days of winter For the warm atmosphere during the day has dissolved much more water than it can support in solution during the cold of the night which is thus deposited in large quantities on the hills and yet so gradually as to soak in between the strata of them rather than to slide off over their surfaces like showers of rain The common heat of the internal parts of the earth is ascertained by springs which arise from strata of earth too deep to be affected by the heat of summer or the frosts of winter Those in this country are of degrees of heat those about Philidelphia were said by Dr Franklin to be whether this variation is to be accounted for by the difference of the sun's heat on that country according to the ingenious theory of Mr Kirwan or to the vicinity of subterranean fires is not yet I think decided There are however subterraneous streams of water not exactly produced in this manner as streams issuing from fissures in the earth communicating with the craters of old volcanoes in the Peak of Derbyshire are many hollows called swallows where the land floods sink into the earth and come out at some miles distant as at Ilam near Ashborne See note on Fica Vol II  Other streams of cold water arise from beneath the snow on the Alps and Andes and other high mountains which is perpetualy thawing at its under surface by the common heat of the earth and gives rise to large rivers For the origin of warm springs see note on Fucus Vol II  NOTE XXVIISHELL FISH  You round Echinus ray his arrowy mail  Give the keel'd Nautilus his oar and sail  Firm to his rock with silver cords suspend  The

of the land animal of the same name The irregular protuberances on other seashells as on some species of the Purpura and Murex serve them as a fortification against the attacks of their enemies  It is said that this animal foresees tempestuous weather and sinking to the bottom of the sea adheres firmly to seaplants or other bodies by means of a substance which resembles the horns of snails Above twelve hundred of these fillets have been counted by which this animal fixes itself and when afloat it contracts these fillets between the bases of its points the number of which often amounts to two thousand Dict raisonne art Oursin de mer  There is a kind of Nautilus called by Linneus Argonauta whose shell has but one cell of this animal Pliny affirms that having exonerated its shell by throwing out the water it swims upon the surface extending a web of wonderful tenuity and bending back two of its arms and rowing with the rest makes a sail and at length receiving the water dives again Plin IX Linneus adds to his description of this animal that like the the Crab Diogenes or Bernhard it occupies a house not its own as it is not connected to its shell and is therefore foreign to it who could have given credit to this if it had not been attested by so many who have with their own eyes seen this argonaut in the act of sailing Syst Nat p  The Nautilus properly so named by Linneus has a shell consisting of many chambers of which cups are made in the East with beautiful painting and carving on the motherpearl The animal is said to inhabit only the uppermost or open chamber which is larger than the rest and that the rest remain empty except that the pipe or siphunculus which communicates from one to the other of them is filled with an appendage of the animal like a gut or string Mr Hook in his Philos Exper p imagines this to be a dilatable or compressible tube like the airbladders of fish and that by contracting or permitting it to expand it renders its shell boyant or the contrary See Note on Ulva Vol II  The Pinna or Seawing is contained in a twovalve shell weighing sometimes fifteen pounds and emits a beard of fine long glossy silklike fibres by which it is suspended to the rocks twenty or thirty feet beneath the surface of the sea In this situation it is so successfully attacked by the eightfooted Polypus that the species perhaps could not exist  but for the exertions of the Cancer Pinnotheris who lives in the same shell as a guard and companion Amoen Academ Vol II p Lin Syst Nat Vol I p and p  The Pinnotheris or Pinnophylax is a small crab naked like Bernard the Hermit but is furnished with good eyes and lives in the same shell with the Pinna when they want food the Pinna opens its shell and sends its faithful ally to forage but if the Cancer sees the Polypus he returns suddenly to the arms of his blind hostesss who by closing the shell avoids the fury of her enemy otherwise when it has procured a booty it brings it to the opening of the shell where it is admitted and they divide the prey This was observed by Haslequist in his voyage to Palestine  The Byssus of the antients according to Aristotle was the beard of the Pinna above mentioned but seems to have been used by other writers indiscriminately for any spun material which was esteemed finer or more valuable than wool Reaumur says the threads of this Byssus are not less fine or less beautiful than the silk as it is spun by the silkworm the Pinna on the coasts of Italy and Provence where it is fished up by ironhooks fixed on long poles is called the silkworm of the sea The stockings and gloves manufactured from it are of exquisite fineness but too warm for common wear and are thence esteemed useful in rhumatism and gout Dict Raisonné art Pinnemarine The warmth of the Byssus like that of silk is probably owing to their being bad conductors of heat as well as of electricity When these fibres are broken by violence this animal as well as the muscle has the power to reproduce them like the common spiders as was observed by M Adanson As raw silk and raw cobwebs when swallowed are liable to produce great sickness as I am informed it is probable the part of muscles which sometimes disagrees with the people who eat them may be this silky web by which they attach themselves to stones The large kind of Pinna contains some motherpearl of a reddish tinge according to M d'Argenville The substance sold under the name of Indian weed and used at the bottom of fishlines is probably a production of this kind which however is scarcely to be distinguished by the eye from the tendons of a rat's tail after they have been separated by putrefaction in water and well cleaned and rubbed a production which I was once shewn as a great curiosity it had the uppermost bone of the tail adhering to it and was said to have been used as an ornament in a lady's hair  NOTE XXVIIISTURGEON  With wormlike beard his toothless lips array  And teach the unweildy Sturgeon to betray

be mistaken for them This clumsy toothless fish is supposed by this contrivance to keep himself in good condition the solidity of his flesh evidently shewing him to be a fish of prey He is said to hide his large body amongst the weeds near the seacoast or at the mouths of large rivers only exposing his cirrhi or tendrils which small fish or seainsects mistaking for real worms approach for plunder and are sucked into the jaws of their enemy He has been supposed by some to root into the soil at the bottom of the sea or rivers but the cirrhi or tendrills abovementioned which hang from his snout over his mouth must themselves be very inconvenient for this purpose and as it has no jaws it evidently lives by suction and during its residence in the sea a quantity of seainsects are found in its stomach  The flesh was so valued in the time of the Emperor Severus that it was brought to table by servants with coronets on their heads and preceded by music which might give rise to its being in our country presented by the Lord Mayor to the King At present it is caught in the Danube and the Walga the Don and other large rivers for various purposes The skin makes the best covering for carriages isinglass is prepared from parts of the skin cavear from the spawn and the flesh is pickled or salted and sent all over Europe  NOTE XXIXOIL ON WATER  Who with fine films suspended o'er the deep  Of Oil effusive lull the waves to sleep  CANTO III  l  THERE is reason to believe that when oil is poured upon water the two surfaces do not touch each other but that the oil is suspended over the water by their mutual repulsion This seems to be rendered probable by the following experiment if one drop of oil be droped on a bason of water it will immediately diffuse itself over the whole for there being no friction between the two surfaces there is nothing to prevent its spreading itself by the gravity of the upper part of it except its own tenacity into a pellicle  of the greatest tenuity But if a second drop of oil be put upon the former it does not spread itself but remains in the form of a drop as the other already occupied the whole surface of the bason and there is friction in oil passing over oil though none in oil passing over water  Hence when oil is diffused on the surface of water gentle breezes have no influence in raising waves upon it for a small quantity of oil will cover a very great surface of water I suppose a spoonful will diffuse itself over some acres and the wind blowing upon this carries it gradually forwards and there being no friction between the two surfaces the water is not affected On which account oil has no effect in stilling the agitation of the water after the wind ceases as was found by the experiments of Dr Franklin  This circumstance lately brought into notice by Dr Franklin had been mentioned by Pliny and is said to be in use by the divers for pearls who in windy weather taken down with them a little oil in their mouths which they occasionally give out when the inequality of the supernatant waves prevents them from seeing sufficiently distinctly for their purpose  The wonderful tenuity with which oil can be spread upon water is evinced by a few drops projected from a bridge where the eye is properly placed over it passing through all the prismatic colours as it diffuses itself And also from another curious experiment of Dr Franklin's he cut a piece of cork to about the size of a letterwafer leaving a point standing off like a tangent at one edge of the circle This piece of cork was then dipped in oil and thrown into a large pond of water and as the oil flowed off at the point the corkwafer continued to revolve in a contrary direction for several minutes The oil flowing off all that time at the pointed tangent in coloured streams In a small pond of water this experiment does not so well succeed as the circulation of the cork stops as soon as the water becomes covered with the pellicle of oil See Additional Note No XIII and Note on Fucus Vol II  The ease with which oil and water slide over each other is agreeably seen if a phial be about half filled with equal parts of oil and water and made to oscillate suspended by a string the upper surface of the oil and the lower one of the water will always keep smooth but the agitation of the surfaces where the oil and water meet is curious for their specific gravities being not very different and their friction on each other nothing the highest side of the water as the phial descends in its oscillation having acquired a greater momentum than the lowest side from its having descended further would rise the highest on the ascending side of the oscillation and thence pushes the then uppermost part of the water amongst the oil  NOTE XXXSHIPWORM  Meet fell Teredo as he mines the keel  With beaked head and break his lips of steel  CANTO III  l  THE Teredo or shipworm has two calcareous jaws hemispherical flat before

fury and in such numbers as often greatly to endanger them It is said that our vessels have not known this new enemy above fifty years that they were brought from the sea about the Antilles to our parts of the ocean where they have increased prodigiously They bore their passage in the direction of the fibres of the wood which is their nourishment and cannot return or pass obliquely and thence when they come to a knot in the wood or when two of them meet together with their stony mouths they perish for want of food  In the years and the United Provinces were under a dreadful alarm concerning these insects which had made great depredation on the piles which support the banks of Zeland but it was happily discovered a few years afterwards that these insects had totally abandoned that island Dict Raisonné art Vers Rongeurs which might have been occasioned by their not being able to live in that latitude when the winter was rather severer than usual  NOTE XXXIMAELSTROM  Turn the broad helm the fluttering canvas urge  From Maelstrom's fierce innavigable surge  CANTO III  l  ON the coast of Norway there is an extensive vortex or eddy which lies between the islands of Moskoe and Moskenas and is called Moskoestrom or Maelstrom it occupies some leagues in circumference and is said to be very dangerous and often destructive to vessels navigating these seas It is not easy to understand the existence of a constant descending stream without supposing it must pass through a subterranean cavity to some other part of the earth or ocean which may lie beneath its level as the Mediterranean seems to lie beneath the level of the Atlantic ocean which therefore  constantly flows into it through the Straits and the waters of the Gulph of Mexico lie much above the level of the sea about the Floridas and further northward which gives rise to the Gulphstream as described in note on Cassia in Vol II  The Maelstrom is said to be still twice in about twentyfour hours when the tide is up and most violent at the opposite times of the day This is not difficult to account for since when so much water is brought over the subterraneous passage if such exists as compleatly to fill it and stand many feet above it less disturbance must appear on the surface The Maelstrom is described in the Memoires of the Swedish Academy of Sciences and Pontoppiden's Hist of Norway and in Universal Museum for p  The reason why eddies of water become hollow in the middle is because the water immediately over the centre of the well or cavity falls faster having less friction to oppose its descent than the water over the circumference or edges of the well The circular motion or gyration of eddies depends on the obliquity of the course of the stream or to the friction or opposition to it being greater on one side of the well than the other I have observed in water passing through a hole in the bottom of a trough which was always kept full the gyration of the stream might be turned either way by increasing the opposition of one side of the eddy with ones finger or by turning the spout through which the water was introduced a little more obliquely to the hole on one side or on the other Lighter bodies are liable to be retained long in eddies of water while those rather heavier than water are soon thrown out beyond the circumference by their acquired momentum becoming greater than that of the water Thus if equal portions of oil and water be put into a phial and by means of a string be whirled in a circle round the hand the water will always keep at the greater distance from the centre whence in the eddies formed in rivers during a flood a person who endeavours to keep above water or to swim is liable to be detained in them but on suffering himself to sink or dive he is said readily to escape This circulation of water in descending through a hole in a vessel Dr Franklin has ingeniously applied to the explanation of hurricanes or eddies of air  NOTE XXXIIGLACIERS  While round dark crags imprison'd waters bend  Through rifted ice in ivory veins descend  CANTO III  l  THE common heat of the interior parts of the earth being always degrees both in winter and summer the snow which lies in contact with it is always in a thawing state Hence in icehouses the external parts of the collection of ice is perpetually thawing and thus preserves the internal part of it so that it is necessary to lay up many tons for the preservation of one ton Hence in Italy considerable rivers have their source from beneath the eternal glaciers or mountains of snow and ice  In our country when the air in the course of a frost continues a day or two at very near degrees the common heat of the earth thaws the ice on its surface while the thermometer remains at the freezing point This circumstance is often observable in the rimy mornings of spring the thermometer shall continue at the freezing point yet all the rime will vanish except that which happens to lie on a bridge a board or on a cake of cowdung which being thus as it were insulated or cut off from so free a communication with the common heat of the earth by means of the air under the bridge or wood or dung which are bad conductors of heat continues some time longer unthawed Hence when the ground is covered thick with snow though the frost continues and the sun does not shine yet the snow is observed to decrease very sensibly For the common heat of the earth melts the under surface of it and the upper one evaporates by its solution in the air The great evaporation of ice was observed by Mr Boyle which experiment I repeated some time ago Having suspended a piece of ice by a wire and weighed it with care without touching it with my hand I hung it out the whole of a clear frosty night and sound in the morning it had lost nearly a fifth of its weight Mr N Wallerius has since observed that ice at the time of its congelation evaporates faster than water in its fluid form which may be accounted for from the heat given out at the instant of freezing Saussure's Essais sur Hygromet p but this effect is only momentary  Thus the vegetables that are covered with snow are seldom injured since as they lie between the thawing snow which has degrees of heat and the covered earth which has they are preserved in a degree of heat between these viz in degrees of heat Whence the moss on which the reindeer feed in the northern latitudes vegetates beneath the snow See note on Muschus Vol II and hence many Lapland and Alpine plants perished through cold in the botanic garden at Upsal for in their native situations though the cold is much more intense yet at its very commencement they are covered deep with snow which remains till late in the spring For this fact see Amaenit Academ Vol I No In our climate such plants do well covered with dried fern under which they will grow and even flower till the severe vernal frosts cease For the increase of glaciers see Note on Canto I l  NOTE XXXIIIWINDS  While southern gales o'er western oceans roll  And Eurus steas his icewinds from the pole  CANTO IV  l  THE theory of the winds is yet very imperfect in part perhaps owing to the want of observations sufficiently numerous of the exact times and places where they begin and cease to blow but chiefly to our yet imperfect knowledge of the means by which great regions of air are either suddenly produced or suddenly destroyed  The air is perpetually subject to increase or diminution from its combination with other bodies or its evolution from them The vital part of the air called oxygene is continually produced in this climate from the perspiration of vegetables in the sunshine and probably from the action of light on clouds or on water in the tropical climates where the sun has greater power and may exert some yet umknown laws of luminous combination Another part of the atmosphere which is called azote is perpetually set at liberty from animal and vegetable bodies by putrefaction or combustion from many springs of water from volatile alcali and probably from fixed alcali of which there is an exhaustless source in the water of the ocean Both these component parts of the air are perpetually again diminished by their contact with the soil which covers the surface of the earth producing nitre The oxygene is diminished in the production of all acids of which the carbonic and muriatic exist in great abundance The azote is diminished in the growth of animal bodies of which it constitutes an important part and in its combinations with many other natural productions  They are both probably diminished in immense quantities by uniting with the inflammable air which arises from the mud of rivers and lakes at some seasons when the atmosphere is light the oxgene of the air producing water and the azote producing volatile alcali by their combinations with this inflammable air At other seasons of the year these principles may again change their combinations and the atmospheric air be reproduced  Mr Lavoisier found that one pound of charcoal in burning consumed two pounds nine ounces of vital air or oxygene The consumption of vital air in the process of making red lead may readily be reduced to calculation a small barrel contains about twelve hundred weight of this commodity pounds of lead by calcination absorb about pounds of vital air now as a cubic foot of water weighs averdupois ounces and as vital air is above times lighter than water it follows that every barrel of red lead contains nearly cubic feet of vital air If this can be performed in miniature in a small oven what may not be done in the immense elaboratories of nature  These great elaboratories of nature include almost all her fossil as well as her animal and vegetable productions Dr Priestley obtained air of greater or less purity both  vital and azotic from almost all the fossil substances he subjected to experiment Four ounceweight of lava from Iceland heated in an earthen retort yielded twenty ouncemeasures of air    ounceweight of  lava  gave    ounce measures of air    basaltes      toadstone    ½  granite      elvain      gypsum      blue slate

this account the fixed air was previously extracted from the limestones by acids and the heat applied was much less than was necessary to extract all the air from the bodies employed Add to this the known quantities of air which are combined with the calciform ores as the ochres of iron manganese calamy grey ore of lead and some idea may be formed of the great production of air in volcanic eruptions as mentioned in note on Chunda Vol II and of the perpetual absorptions and evolutions of whole oceans of air from every part of the earth  But there would seem to be an officina aeris a shop where air is both manufactured and destroyed in the greatest abundance within the polar circles as will hereafter be spoken of Can this be effected by some yet unknown law of the congelation of aqueous or saline fluids which may set at liberty their combined heat and convert a part both of the acid and alcali of seawater into their component airs Or on the contrary can the electricity of the northern lights convert inflammable air and oxygene into water whilst the great degree of cold at the poles unites the azote with some other base Another officina aeris or manufacture of air would seem to exist within the tropics or at the line though in a much less quantity than at the poles owing perhaps to the action of the sun's light on the moisture suspended in the air as will also be spoken of hereafter but in all other parts of the earth these absorptions and evolutions of air in a greater or less degree are perpetually going on in inconceivable abundance increased probably and diminished at different seasons of the year by the approach or retrocession of the sun's light future discoveries must elucidate this part of the subject To this should be added  that as heat and electricity and perhaps magnetism are known to displace air that it is not impossible but that the increased or diminished quantities of these fluids diffused in the atmosphere may increase its weight a well as its bulk since their specific attractions or affinities to matter are very strong they probably also possess general gravitation to the earth a subject which wants further investigation See Note XXVI  SOUTHWEST WINDS  The velocity of the surface of the earth in moving round its axis diminishes from the equator to the poles Whence if a region of air in this country should be suddenly removed a few degrees towards the north it must constitute a western wind because from the velocity it had previously acquired in this climate by its friction with the earth it would for a time move quicker than the surface of the country it was removed to the contrary must ensue when a region of air is transported from this country a few degrees southward because the velocity it had acquired in this climate would be less than that of the earth's surface where it was removed to whence it would appear to constitute a wind from the east while in reality the eminent parts of the earth would be carried against the too slow air But if this transportation of air from south to north be performed gradually the motion of the wind will blow in the diagonal between south and west And on the contrary if a region of air be gradually removed from north to south it would also blow diagonally between the north and east from whence we may safely conclude that all our winds in this country which blow from the north or east or any point between them consist of regions of air brought from the north and that all our winds blowing from the south or west or from any point between them are regions of air brought from the south  It frequently happens during the vernal months that after a northeast wind has passed over us for several weeks during which time the barometer has stood at above ½ inches it becomes suddenly succeeded by a southwest wind which also continues several weeks and the barometer sinks to nearly ½ inches Now as two inches of the mercury in the barometer balance onefifteenth part of the whole atmosphere an important question here presents itself  what is become of all this air  This great quantity of air can not be carried in a superior current towards the line while the inferior current flows towards the poles because then it would equally affect the barometer which should not therefore subside from ½ inches to ½ for six weeks together  It cannot be owing to the air having lost all the moisture which was previously dissolved in it because these warm southwest winds are replete with moisture and the cold northeast winds which weigh up the mercury in the barometer to inches consist of dry air  It can not be carried over the polar regions and be accumulated on the meridian opposite to us in its passage towards the line as such an accumulation would equal onefifteenth of the whole atmosphere and can not be supposed to remain in that situation for six weeks together  It can not depend on the existence of tides in the atmosphere since it must then correspond to lunar periods Nor to accumulations of air from the specific levity of the upper regions of the atmosphere since its degree of fluidity must correspond with its tenuity and consequently such great mountains of air can not be supposed to exist for so many weeks together as the southwest winds sometimes continue  It remains therefore that there must be at this time a great and sudden absorption of air in the polar circle by some unknown operation of nature and that the south wind runs in to supply the deficiency Now as this south wind consists of air brought from a part of the earth's surface which moves faster than it does in this climate it must have at the same time a direction from the west by retaining part of the velocity it had previously acquired These southwest winds coming from a warmer country and becoming colder by their contact with the earth of this climate and by their evpansion so great a part of the superincumbent atmosphere having vanished precipitate their moisture and as they continue for several weeks to be absorbed in the polar circle would seem to receive a perpetual supply from the tropical regions especially over the line as will hereafter be spoken of  It may sometimes happen that a northeast wind having passed over us may be bent down and driven back before it has acquired any heat from the climate and may thus for a few hours or a day have a southwest direction and from its descending from a higher region of the atmosphere may possess a greater degree of cold than an inferior northeast current of air  The extreme cold of Jan at Paris came on with a gentle south wind and was diminished when the wind changed to the north which is accounted for by Mr Homberg from a reflux of air which had been flowing for some time from the north Chemical Essays by R Watson Vol V p  It may happen that a northeast current may for a day or two pass over us and produce incessant rain by mixing with the inferior southwest current but this as well as the former is of short duration as its friction will soon carry the inferior current along with it and dry or frosty weather will then succeed  NORTHEAST WINDS  The northeast winds of this country consist of regions of air from the north travelling sometimes at the rate of about a mile in two minutes during the vernal months for several weeks together from the polar regions toward the south the mercury in the barometer standing above These winds consist of air greatly cooled by the evaporation of the ice and snow over which it passes and as they become warmer by their contact with the earth of this climate are capable of dissolving more moisture as they pass along and are thence attended with frosts in winter and with dry hot weather in summer  This great quantity of air can not be supplied by superior currents passing in a contrary direction from south to north because such currents must as they arise into the atmosphere a mile or two high become exposed to so great cold as to occasion them  to deposit their moisture which would fall through the inferior current upon the earth in some part of their passage  The whole atmosphere must have increased in quantity because it appears by the barometer that there exists onefifteenth part more air over us for many weeks together which could not be thus accumulated by difference of temperature in respect to heat or by any aerostatic laws at present known or by any lunar influence  From whence it would appear that immense masses of air were set at liberty from their combinations with solid bodies along with a sufficient quantity of combined heat within the polar circle or in some region to the north of us and that they thus perpetually increase the quantity of the atmosphere and that this is again at certain times reabsorbed or enters into new combinations at the line or tropical regions By which wonderful contrivance the atmosphere is perpetually renewed and rendered fit for the support of animal and vegetable life  SOUTHEAST WINDS  The southeast winds of this country consist of air from the north which had passed by us or over us and before it had obtained the velocity of the earth's surface in this climate had been driven back owing to a deficiency of air now commencing at the polar regions Hence these are generally dry or freezing winds and if they succeed northeast winds should prognosticate a change of wind from northeast to southwest the barometer is generally about They are sometimes attended with cloudy weather or rain owing to their having acquired an increased degree of warmth and moisture before they became retrograde or to their being mixed with air from the south  Sometimes these southeast winds consist of a vertical eddy of northeast air without any mixture of southwest air in that case the barometer continues above and the weather is dry or frosty for four or five days together  It should here be observed that air being an elastic fluid must be more liable to eddies than water and that these eddies must extend into cylinders or vortexes of greater diameter and that if a vertical eddy of northeast air be of small diameter or has passed but a little way to the south of us before its return it will not have gained the velocity of the earth's surface to the south of us and will in consequence become a southeast windBut if the vertical eddy be of large diameter or has passed much to the south of us it will have acquired velocity from its friction with the earth's surface to the south of us and will in consequence on its return become a southwest wind producing great cold  NORTHWEST WINDS  There seem to be three sources of the northwest winds of this hemisphere of the earth When a portion of southern air which was passing over us is driven back by accumulation of new air in the polar regions In this cafe I suppose they are generally moist or rainy winds with the barometer under and if the wind had previously been in the southwest it would seem to prognosticate a change to the northeast  If a current of north wind is passing over us but a few miles high without any easterly direction and is bent down upon us it must immediately possess a westerly direction because it will now move faster than the surface of the earth where it arrives and thus becomes changed from a northeast to a northwest wind This descent of a northeast current of air producing a northwest wind may continue some days with clear or freezing weather as it may be simply owing to a vertical eddy of northeast air as will be spoken of below It may otherwise be forced down by a current of southwest wind passing over it and in this case it will be attended with rain for a few days by the mixture of the two airs of different degrees of heat and will prognosticate a change of wind from northeast to southwest if the wind was previously in the northeast quarter  On the eastern coast of North America the northwest winds bring frost as the northeast winds do in this country as appears from variety of testimony This seems to happen from a vertical spiral eddy made in the atmosphere between the shore and the ridge of mountains which form the spine or backbone of that continent If a current of water runs along the hypothenuse of a triangle an eddy will be made in the included angle which will turn round like a waterwheel as the stream passes in contact with one edge of it The same must happen when a sheet of air flowing along from the northeast rises from the shore in a straight line to the summit of the Apalachian mountains a part of the stream of northeast air will flow over the mountains another part will revert and circulate spirally between the summit of the country and the eastern shore continuing to move toward the south and thus be changed from a northeast to a northwest wind  This vertical spiral eddy having been in contact with the cold summits of these mountains and descending from higher parts of the atmosphere will lose part of its heat and thus constitute one cause of the greater coldness of the eastern sides of North America than of the European shores opposite to them which is said to be equal to twelve degrees of north latitude which is a wonderful fact not otherwise easy to be explained since the heat of the springs at Philadelphia is said to be which is greater than the medium heat of the earth in this country  The existence of vertical eddies or great cylinders of air rolling on the surface of the earth is agreeable to the observations of the constructors of windmills who on this idea place the area of the fails leaning backwards inclined to the horizon and believe that then they have greater power than when they are placed quite perpendicularly The same kind of rolling cylinders of water obtain in rivers owing to the friction of the water against the earth at their bottoms as is known by bodies having been observed to float upon their surfaces quicker than when immersed to a certain depth These vertical eddies of air probably exist all over the earth's surface but particularly at the bottom or sides of mountains and more so probably in the course of the southwest than of the northeast winds because the former fall from an eminence as it were on a part of the earth where there is a deficiency of the quantity of air as is shewn by the sinking of the barometer whereas the latter are pushed or  squeezed forward by an addition to the atmosphere behind them as appears by the rising of the barometer  TRADEWINDS  A column of heated air becomes lighter than before and will therefore ascend by the pressure of the cold air which surrounds it like a cork in water or like heated smoke in a chimney  Now as the sun passes twice over the equator for once over either tropic the equator has not time to become cool and on this account it is in general hotter at the line than at the tropics and therefore the air over the line except in some few instances hereafter to be mentioned continues to ascend at all seasons of the year pressed upwards by regions of air brought from the tropics  This air thus brought from the tropics to the equator would constitute a north wind on one side of the equator and a south wind on the other but as the surface of the earth at the equator moves quicker than the surface of the earth at the tropics it is evident that a region of air brought from either tropic to the equator and which had previously only acquired the velocity of the earth's surface at the tropics will now move too flow for the earth's surface at the equator and will thence appear to move in a direction contrary to the motion of the earth Hence the tradewinds though they consist of regions of air brought from the north on one side of the line and from the south on the other will appear to have the diagonal direction of northeast and southwest winds  Now it is commonly believed that there are superior currents of air passing over these northeast and southwest currents in a contrary direction and which descending near the tropics produce vertical whirlpools of air An important question here again presents itself  What becomes of the moisture which this heated air ought to deposit as it cools in the upper regions of the atmosphere in its journey to the tropics  It has been shewn by Dr Priestley and Mr Ingenhouz that the green matter at the bottom of cisterns and the fresh leaves of plants immersed in water give out considerable quantities of vital air in the sunshine that is the perspirable matter of plants which is water much divided in its egress from their minute pores becomes decomposed by the sun's light and converted into two kinds of air the vital and inflammable airs The moisture contained or dissolved in the ascending heated air at the line must exist in great tenuity and by being exposed to the great light of the sun in that climate the water may be decomposed and the new airs spread on the atmosphere from the line to the poles  From there being no constant deposition of rains in the usual course of the tradewinds it would appear that the water rising at the line is decomposed in its ascent  From the observations of M Bougner on the mountain Pinchinca one of the Cordelieres immediately under the line there appears to be no condensible vapour above three or four miles high Now though the atmosphere at that height may be cold to a very considerable degree yet its total deprivation of condensible vapour would seem to shew that its water was decomposed as there are no experiments to evince that any degree of cold hitherto known has been able to deprive air of its moisture and great  abundance of snow is deposited from the air that flows to the polar regions though it is exposed to no greater degrees of cold in its journey thither than probably exists at four miles height in the atmosphere at the line  The hygrometer of Mr Saussure also pointed to dryness as he ascended into rarer air the single hair of which it was constructed contracting from deficiency of moisture Essais sur l'Hygromet p  From these observations it appears either that rare and cold air requires more moisture to saturate it than dense air or that the moisture becomes decomposed and converted into air as it ascends into there cold and rare regions of the atmosphere  There seems some analogy between the circumstance of air being produced or generated in the cold parts of the atmosphere both at the line and at the poles  MONSOONS AND TORNADOES  In the Arabian and Indian seas are winds which blow fix months one way and six months the other and are called Monsoons by the accidental dispositions of land and sea it happens that in some places the air near the tropic is supposed to become warmer when the sun is vertical over it than at the line The air in these places consequently ascends pressed upon one side by the northeast regions of air and on the other side by the southwest regions of air For as the air brought from the south has previously obtained the velocity of the earth's surface at the line it moves faster than the earth's surface near the tropic where it now arrives and becomes a southwest wind while the air from the north becomes a northeast wind as before explained These two winds do not so quietly join and ascend as the northeast and southeast winds which meet at the line with equal warmth and velocity and form the tradewinds but as they meet in contrary directions before they ascend and cannot be supposed accurately to balance each other a rotatory motion will be produced as they ascend like water falling through a hole and an horizontal or spiral eddy is the consequence these eddies are more or less rapid and are called Tornadoes in their most violent state raising water from the ocean in the west or sand from the deserts of the east in less violent degrees they only mix together the two currents of northeast and southwest air and produce by this means incessant rains as the air of the northeast acquires some of the heat from the southwest wind as explained in Note XXV This circumstance of the eddies produced by the monsoonwinds was seen by Mr Bruce in Abyssinia he relates that for many successive mornings at the commencement of the rainy monsoon he observed a cloud of apparently small dimensions whirling round with great rapidity and in a few minutes the heavens became covered with dark clouds with consequent great rains See Note on Canto III l  But it is not only at the place where the air ascends at the northern extremity of the rainy monsoon and where it forms tornadoes as observed above by Mr Bruce but over a great tract of country several degrees in length in certain parts as in the Arabian sea a perpetual rain for several months descends similar to what happens for weeks together in our own climate in a less degree during the southwest winds Another important  question presents itself here  If the climate to which this southwest wind arrives is not colder than that it comes from why should it deposit its moisture during its whole journey if it be a colder climate why does it come thither  The tornadoes of air above described can extend but a little way and it is not easy to conceive that a superior cold current of air can mix with an inferior one and thus produce showers over ten degrees of country since at about three miles high there is perpetual frost and what can induce these narrow and shallow currents to flow over each other so many hundred miles  Though the earth at the northren extremity of this monsoon may be more heated by certain circumstances of situation than at the line yet it seems probable that the intermediate country between that and the line may continue colder than the line as in other parts of the earth and hence that the air coming from the line to supply this ascent or destruction of air at the northern extremity of the monsoon will be cooled all the way in its approach and in consequence deposit its water It seems probable that at the northern extremity of this monsoon where the tornadoes or hurricanes exist that the air not only ascends but is in part converted into water or otherwise diminished in quantity as no account is given of the existence of any superior currents of it  As the southwest winds are always attended with a light atmosphere an incipient vacancy or a great diminution of air must have taken place to the northward of them in all parts of the earth wherever they exist and a deposition of their moisture succeeds their being cooled by the climate they arrive at and not by a contrary current of cold air over them since in that case the barometer would not sink They may thus in our own country be termed monsoons without very regular periods  Another cause of TORNADOES independent of the monsoons is ingeniously explained by Dr Franklin when in the tropical countries a stratum of inferior air becomes so heated by its contact with the warm earth that its expansion is increased more than is equivalent to the pressure of the stratum of air over it or when the superior stratum becomes more condensed by cold than the inferior one by pressure the upper region will descend and the lower one ascend In this situation if one part of the atmosphere be hotter from some fortuitous circumstances or has less pressure over it the lower stratum will begin to ascend at this part and resemble water falling through a hole as mentioned above If the lower region of air was going forwards with considerable velocity it will gain an eddy by rising up this hole in the incumbent heavy air so that the whirlpool or tornado has not only its progressive velocity but its circular one also which thus lifts up or overturns every thing within its spiral whirl By the weaker whirlwinds in this country the trees are sometimes thrown down in a line of only twenty or forty yards in breadth making a kind of avenue through a country In the West Indies the sea rises like a cone in the whirl and is met by black clouds produced by the cold upper air and the warm lower air being rapidly mixed whence are produced the great and sudden rains called waterspouts while the upper and lower airs exchange their plus or minus electricity in perpetual lightenings  LAND AND SEABREEZES  The sea being a transparent mass is less heated at its surface by the sun's rays than the land and its continual change of surface contributes to preserve a greater uniformity in the heat of the air which hangs over it Hence the surface of the tropical islands is more heated during the day than the sea that surrounds them and cools more in the night by its greater elevation whence in the afternoon when the lands of the tropical islands have been much heated by the sun the air over them ascends pressed upwards by the cooler air of the incircling ocean in the morning again the land becoming cooled more than the sea the air over it descends by its increased gravity and blows over the ocean near its shores  CONCLUSION  There are various irregular winds besides those above described which consist of horizontal or vertical eddies of air owing to the inequality of the earth's surface or the juxtaposition of the sea Other irregular winds have their origin from increased evaporation of water or its sudden devaporation and descent in showers others from the partial expansion and condensation of air by heat and cold by the accumulation or defect of electric fluid or to the air's new production or absorption occasioned by local causes not yet discovered See Notes VII and XXV  There seem to exist only two original winds one consisting of air brought from the north and the other of air brought from the south The former of these winds has also generally an apparent direction from the east and the latter from the west arising from the different velocities of the earth's surface All the other winds above described are deflections or retrogressions of some parts of these currents of air from the north or south  One fifteenth part of the atmosphere is occasionally destroyed and occasionally reproduced by unknown causes These causes are brought into immediate activity over a great part of the surface of the earth at nearly the same time but always act more powerful to the northward than to the southward of any given place and would hence seem to have their principal effect in the polar circles existing nevertheless though with less power toward the tropics or at the line  For when the northeast wind blows the barometer rises sometimes from ½ inches to ½ which shews a great new generation of air in the north and when the southwest wind blows the barometer sinks as much which shews a great destruction of air in the north But as the northeast winds sometimes continue for five or six weeks the newlygenerated air must be destroyed at those times in the warmer climates to the south of us or circulate in superior currents which has been shewn to be improbable from its not depositing its water And as the southwest winds sometimes continue for some weeks there must be a generation of air to the south at those times or superior currents which last has been shewn to be improbable  The northeast winds being generated about the poles are pushed forwards towards the tropics or line by the pressure from behind and hence they become warmer as  explained in Note VII as well as by their coming into contact with a warmer part of the earth which contributes to make these winds greedily absorb moisture in their passage On the contrary the southwest winds as the atmosphere is suddenly diminished in the polar regions are drawn as it were into an incipient vacancy and become therefore expanded in their passage and thus generate cold as explained in Note VII and are thus induced to part with their moisture as well as by their contact with a colder part of the earth's surface Add to this that the difference in the sound of the northeast and southwest winds may depend on the former being pushed forwards by a pressure behind and the latter falling as it were into a partial or incipient vacancy before whence the former becomes more condensed and the latter more rarefied as it passes There is a whistle termed a larkcall which consists of a hollow cylinder of tinplate closed at each end about half an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch high with opposite holes about the size of a goosequill through the centre of each end if this larkwhistle be held between the lips the sound of it is manifestly different when the breath is forceably blown through it from within outwards and when it is sucked from without inwards Perhaps this might be worthy the attention of organbuilders  A stop is put to this new generation of air when about a fifteenth of the whole is produced by its increasing pressure and a similar boundary is fixed to its absorption or destruction by the decrease of atmospheric pressure As water requires more heat to convert it into vapour under a heavy atmosphere than under a light one so in letting off the water from muddy fishponds great quantities of airbubbles are seen to ascend from the bottom which were previously confined there by the pressure of the water Similar bubbles of inflammable air are seen to arise from lakes in many seasons of the year when the atmosphere suddenly becomes light  The increased absorptions and evolutions of air must like its simple expansions depend much on the presence or absence of heat and light and will hence in respect to the times and places of its production and destruction be governed by the approach or retrocession of the sun and on the temperature in regard to heat of various latitudes and parts of the same latitude so well explained by Mr Kirwan  Though the immediate cause of the destruction or reproduction of great masses of air at certain times when the wind changes from north to south or from south to north can not yet be ascertained yet as there appears greater difficulty in accounting for this change of wind for any other known causes we may still suspect that there exists in the arctic and antarctic circles a BEAR or DRAGON yet unknown to philosophers which at times suddenly drinks up and as suddenly at other times vomits out onefifteenth part of the atmosphere and hope that this or some future age will learn how to govern and domesticate a monster which might be rendered of such important service to mankind  INSTRUMENTS  IF along with the usual registers of the weather observations were made on the winds in many parts of the earth with the three following instruments which might be constructed at no great expence some useful information might be acquired  To mark the hour when the wind changes from northeast to southwest and the contrary This might be managed by making a communication from the vane of a weathercock to a clock in such a manner that if the vane should revolve quite round a tooth on its revolving axis should stop the clock or put back a small bolt on the edge of a wheel revolving once in twentyfour hours  To discover whether in a year more air passed from north to south or the contrary This might be effected by placing a windmillsail of copper about nine inches diameter in a hollow cylinder about six inches long open at both ends and fixed on an eminent situation exactly north and south Thence only a part of the northeast and southwest currents would affect the sail so as to turn it and if its revolutions were counted by an adapted machinery as the sail would turn one way with the north currents of air and the contrary one with the south currents the advance of the counting finger either way would shew which wind had prevailed most at the end of the year  To discover the rolling cylinders of air the vane of a weathercock might be so suspended as to dip or rise vertically as well as to have its horizontal rotation  RECAPITULATION  NORTHEAST WINDS consist of air flowing from the north where it seems to be occasionally produced has an apparent direction from the east owing to its not having acquired in its journey the increasing velocity of the earth's surface these winds are analogous to the tradewinds between the tropics and frequently continue in the vernal months for four and six weeks together with a high barometer and fair or frosty weather They sometimes consist of southwest air which had passed by us or over us driven back by a new accumulation of air in the north These continue but a day or two and are attended with rain See Note XXV  SOUTHWEST WIND consists of air flowing from the south and seems occasionally absorbed at its arrival to the more northern latitudes It has a real direction from the west owing to its not having lost in its journey the greater velocity it had acquired from the earth's surface from whence it came These winds are analogous to the monsoons between the tropics and frequently continue for four or six weeks together with a low barometer and rainy weather They sometimes consist of northeast air which had passed by us or over us which becomes retrograde by a commencing deficiency of air in the north These winds continue but a day or two attended with severer frost with a sinking barometer their cold being increased by their expansion as they return into an incipient vacancy  NORTHWEST WINDS consist first of southwest winds which have passed over us bent down and driven back towards the south by newly generated northern air They continue but a day or two and are attended with rain or clouds They consist of northeast winds bent down from the higher parts of the atmosphere and having there acquired a greater velocity than the earth's surface are frosty or fair They consist of northeast winds formed into a vertical spiral eddy as on the eastern coasts of North America and bring severe frost  SOUTHEAST WINDS consist first of northeast winds become retrograde continue for a day or two frosty or fair sinking barometer They consist of northeast winds formed into a vertical eddy not a spiral one frost or fair  NORTH WINDS consist first of air flowing slowly from the north so that they acquire the velocity of the earth's surface as they approach are fair or frosty seldom occur They consist of retrograde south winds these continue but a day or two are preceded by southwest winds and are generally succeeded by northeast winds cloudy or rainy barometer rising  SOUTH WINDS consist first of air flowing slowly from the south loosing their previous western velocity by the friction of the earth's surface as they approach moist seldom occur They consist of retrograde north winds these continue but a day or two are preceded by northeast winds and generally succeeded by southwest winds colder barometer sinking  EAST WINDS consist of air brought hastily from the north and not impelled farther southward owing to a sudden beginning absorption of air in the northern regions very cold barometer high generally succeeded by southwest wind  WEST WINDS consist of air brought hastily from the south and checked from proceeding further to the north by a beginning production of air in the northern regions warm and moist generally succeeded by northeast wind They consist of air bent down from the higher regions of the atmosphere if this air be from the south and brought hastily it becomes a wind of great velocity moving perhaps miles an hour is warm and rainy if it consists of northern air bent down it is of less velocity and colder  Application of the preceding Theory to some Extracts from a Journal of the Weather  Dec  The barometer sunk suddenly and the wind which had been some days northeast with frost changed to southeast with an incessant though moderate fall of snow A part of the northern air which had passed by us I suppose now became retrograde before it had acquired the velocity of the earth's surface to the south of us and being attended by some of the southern air in its journey the moisture of the latter became condensed and frozen by its mixture mith the former  Dec  The wind changed to northwest and thawed the snow A part of the southern air which had passed by us or over us with the retrograde northern air above described was now in its turn driven back before it had lost the velocity of the surface of the earth to the south of us and consequently became a northwest wind and not having lost the warmth it brought from the south produced a thaw  Dec  Wind changed to northeast with frost and a rising barometer The air from the north continuing to blow after it had driven back the southern air as above described became a northeast wind having less velocity than the surface of the earth in this climate and produced frost from its coldness  Dec  Wind now changed to the southwest with incessant rain and a sinking barometer From unknown causes I suppose the quantity of air to be diminished in the polar regions and the southern air cooled by the earth's surface which was previously frozen deposits its moisture for a day or two afterwards the wind continued southwest without rain as the surface of the earth became warmer  March  There has been a long frost a few days ago the barometer sunk to ½ and the frost became more severe Because the air being expanded by a part of the pressure being taken off became colder This day the mercury rose to and the frost ceased the wind continuing as before between north and east  March  Mercury above weather still milder no frost wind northeast  March  The same for the mercury rising shews that the air becomes more compressed by the weight above▪ and in consequence gives out warmth  April  Frost wind northeast the wind changed in the middle of the day to the northwest without rain and has done so for three or four days becoming again northeast at night For the sun now giving greater degrees of heat the air ascends as the sun passes the zenith and is supplied below by the air on the western side as well as on the eastern side of the zenith during the hot part of the day whence for a few hours on the approach of the hot part of the day the air acquires a westerly direction in this longitude If the northwest wind had been caused by a retrograde motion of some southern air which had passed over us it would have been attended with rain or clouds  April  It rained all day yesterday the wind northwest this morning there was a sharp frost The evaporation of the moisture which fell yesterday occasioned by the continuance of the wind produced so much cold as to freeze the dew  May  Frequent showers with a current of colder wind preceding every shower The sinking of the rain or cloud pressed away the air from beneath it in its descent which having been for a time shaded from the sun by the floating cloud became cooled in some degree  June  The barometer sunk the wind became southwest and the whole heaven was instantly covered with clouds A part of the incumbent atmosphere having vanished as appeared by the sinking of the barometer the remainder became expanded by its elasticity and thence attracted some of the matter of heat from the vapour intermixed with it and thus in a few minutes a total devaporation took place as in exhausting the receiver of an airpump See note XXV At the place where the air is destroyed currents both from the north and south flow in to supply the deficiency for it has been shewn that there are no other proper winds but these two and the mixture of these winds produces so sudden condensation of the moisture both by the coldness of the northern air and the expansion of both of them that lightning is given out and an incipient tornado takes place whence thunder is said frequently to approach against the wind  August  Barometer was at and  Dec  in the same year it was at tenths Medical Essays Edinburgh Vol II p It appears from these journals that the mercury at Edinburgh varies sometimes nearly three inches or one tenth of  the whole atmosphere From the journals kept by the Royal Society at London it appears seldom to vary more than two inches or onefifteenth of the whole atmosphere The quantity of the variation is said still to decrease nearer the line and to increase in the more northern latitudes which much confirms the idea that there exists at certain times a great destruction or production of air within the polar circle  July  The westerly winds in the journal in the Medical Essays Vol II above referred to are frequently marked with the number three to shew their greater velocity whereas the easterly winds seldom approach to the number two The greater velocity of the westerly winds than the easterly ones is well known I believe in every climate of the world which may be thus explained from the theory above delivered When the air is still the higher parts of the atmosphere move quicker than those parts which touch the earth because they are at a greater distance from the axis of motion The part of the atmosphere where the north or south wind comes from is higher than the part of it where it comes to hence the more elevated parts of the atmosphere continue to descend towards the earth as either of those winds approach When southern air is brought to us it possesses a westerly direction also owing to the velocity it had previously acquired from the earth's surface and if it consists of air from the higher parts of the atmosphere descending nearer the earth this westerly velocity becomes increased But when northern air is brought to us it possesses an apparent easterly direction also owing to the velocity which it had previously acquired from the earth's surface being less than that of the earth's surface in this latitude now if the northeast wind consists of air descending from higher parts of the atmosphere this deficiency of velocity will be less in consequence of the same cause viz The higher parts of the atmosphere descending as the wind approaches increases the real velocity of the western winds and decreases the apparent velocity of the eastern ones  October  Wind changed from southeast to southwest There is a popular prognostication that if the wind changes from the north towards the south passing through the east it is more likely to continue in the south than if it passes through the west which may be thus accounted for If the northeast wind changes to a northwest wind it shews either that a part of the northern air descends upon us in a spiral eddy or that a superior current of southern air is driven back but if a northeast wind be changed into a southeast wind it shews that the northern air is become retrograde and that in a day or two as soon as that part of it has passed which has not gained the velocity of the earth's surface in this latitude it will become a south wind for a few hours and then a southwest wind  The writer of this imperfect sketch of anemology wishes it may incite some person of greater leizure and ability to attend to this subject and by comparing the various meteorological journals and observations already published to construct a more accurate and methodical treatise on this interesting branch of philosophy  NOTE XXXIVVEGETABLE PERSPIRATION  And wed the enamoured Oxygene to Light  CANTO IV  l  WHEN points or hairs are put into springwater as in the experiments of Sir B Thompson Philos Trans Vol LXXVII and exposed to the light of the sun much air which loosely adhered to the water rises in bubbles as explained in note on Fucus Vol II A still greater quantity of air and of a purer kind is emitted by Dr Priestley's green matter and by vegetable leaves growing in water in the sunshine according to Mr Ingenhouze's experiments both which I suspect to be owing to a decomposition of the water perspired by the plant for the edge of a capillary tube of great tenuity may be considered as a circle of points and as the oxygene or principle of vital air may be expanded into a gas by the sun's light the hydrogene or inflammable air may be detained in the pores of the vegetable  Hence plants growing in the shade are white and become green by being exposed to the sun's light for their natural colour being blue the addition of hydrogene adds yellow to this blue and  tans  them green I suppose a similar circumstance takes place in animal bodies their perspirable matter as it escapes in the sunshine becomes decomposed by the edges of their pores as in vegetables though in less quantity as their perspiration is less and by the hydrogene being retained the skin becomes  tanned  yellow In proof of this it must be observed that both vegetable and animal substances become bleached white by the sunbeams when they are dead as cabbagestalks bones ivory tallow beeswax linen and cotton cloth and hence I suppose the coppercoloured natives of sunny countries might become etiolated or blanched by being kept from their infancy in the dark or removed for a few generations to more northerly climates  It is probable that on a sunny morning much pure air becomes separated from the dew by means of the points of vegetables on which it adheres and much inflammable air imbibed by the vegetable or combined with it and by the sun's light thus decomposing water the effects of it in bleaching linen seems to depend as described in Note X the water is decomposed by the light at the ends or points of the cotton or thread and the vital air unites with the phlogistic or colouring matters of the cloth and produces a new acid which is either itself colourless or washes out at the same time the inflammable part of the water escapes Hence there seems a reason why cotton bleaches so much sooner than linen viz because its fibres are three or four times shorter and therefore protrude so many more points which seem to facilitate the liberation of the vital air from the inflammable part of the water  Bee's wax becomes bleached by exposure to the sun and dews in a similar manner as metals become calcined or rusty viz by the water on their surface being decomposed and hence the inflammable material which caused the colour becomes united with vital air forming a new acid and is washed away  Oil close stopped in a phial not full and exposed long to the sun's light becomes bleached as I suppose by the decomposition of the water it contains the inflammable air rising above the surface and the vital air uniting with the colouring matter of the oil For it is remarkable that by shutting up a phial of bleached oil in a dark drawer it in a little time becomes coloured again  The following experiment shews the power of light in separating vital air from another basis viz from azote Mr Scheel inverted a glass vessel filled with colourless nitrous acid into another glass containing the same acid and on exposing them to the sun's light the inverted glass became partly filled with pure air and the acid at the same time became coloured Scheel in Crell's Annal But if the vessel of colourless nitrous acid be quite full and stopped so that no space is left for the air produced to expand itself into no change of colour takes place Priestley's Exp VI p See Keir's very excellent Chemical Dictionary p new edition  A sunflower three feet and half high according to the experiment of Dr Hales perspired two pints in one day Vegetable Statics which is many times as much in proportion to its surface as is perspired from the surface and lungs of animal bodies it follows that the vital air liberated from the surfaces of plants by the sunshine must much exceed the quantity of it absorbed by their respiration and that hence they improve the air in which they live during the light part of the day and thus blanched vegetables will sooner become  tanned into green  by the sun's light than etiolated animal bodies will become  tanned yellow  by the same means  It is hence evident that the curious discovery of Dr Priestley that his green vegetable matter and other aquatic plants gave out vital air when the sun shone upon them and the leaves of other plants did the same when immersed in water as observed by Mr Ingenhouze refer to the perspiration of vegetables not to their respiration Because Dr Priestley observed the pure air to come from both sides of the leaves and even from the stalks of a waterflag whereas one side of the leaf only serves the of the office of lungs and certainly not the stalks Exper on Air Vol III And thus in respect to the circumstance in which plants and animals seemed the furtherest removed from each other I mean in their supposed mode of respiration by which one was believed to purify the air which the other had injured they seem to differ only in degree and the analogy between them remains unbroken  Plants are said by many writers to grow much faster in the night than in the day as is particularly observable in seedlings at their rising out of the ground This probably is a consequence of their sleep rather than of the absence of light and in this I suppose they also resemble animal bodies  NOTE XXXVVEGETABLE PLACENTATION  While in bright veins the silvery sap ascends  CANTO IV  l  AS buds are the viviparous offspring of vegetables it becomes necessary that they should be furnished with placental vessels for their nourishment till they acquire lungs or leaves for the purpose of elaborating the common juices of the earth into nutriment These vessels exist in bulbs and in seeds and supply the young plant with a sweet juice till it acquires leaves as is seen in converting barley into malt and appears from the sweet taste of onions and potatoes when they begin to grow  The placental vessels belonging to the buds of trees are placed about the roots of most as the vine so many roots are furnished with sweet or mealy matter as fernroot bryony carrot turnip potatoe or in the alburnum or sapwood as in those trees which produce manna which is deposited about the month of August or in the joints of sugar cane and grasses early in the spring the absorbent mouths of these vessels drink up moisture from the earth with a saccharine matter lodged for that purpose during the preceding autumn and push this nutritive fluid up the vessels of the alburnum to every individual bud as is evinced by the experiments of Dr Hales and of Mr Walker in the Edinburgh Philosophical Transact The former observed that the sap from the stump of a vine which he had cut off in the beginning of April arose twentyone feet high in tubes affixed to it for that purpose but in a few weeks it ceased to bleed at all and Dr Walker marked the progress of the ascending sap and found likewise that as soon as the leaves became expanded the sap ceased to rise the ascending juice of some trees is so copious and so sweet during the sapseason that it is used to make wine as the birch betula and sycamore acer pseudoplatinus and particularly the palm  During this ascent of the sapjuice each individual leafbud expands its new leaves and shoots down new roots covering by their intertexture the old bark with a new one and as soon as these new roots or bark are capable of absorbing sufficient juices from the earth for the support of each bud and the new leaves are capable of performing their office of exposing these juices to the influence of the air the placental vessels cease to act coalesce and are transformed from sapwood or alburnum into inert wood serving only for the support of the new tree which grows over them  Thus from the pith of the new bud of the horsechesnut five vessels pass out through the circle of the placental vessels above described and carry with them a minuter circle of those vessels these five bundles of vessels unite after their exit and form the footstalk or petiole of the new fivefingered leaf to be spoken of hereafter This structure is well seen by cutting off a leaf of the horsechesnut Aesculus Hippocastanum in September before it falls as the buds of this tree are so large that the flower may be seen in them with the naked eye  After a time perhaps about midsummer another bundle of vessels passes from the pith through the alburnum or sapvessels in the bosom of each leaf and unites by the new bark with the leaf which becomes either a flowerbud or a leafbud to be expanded in the ensuing spring for which purpose an apparatus of placental vessels are produced with proper nutriment during the progress of the summer and autumn and thus the vegetable becomes annually increased ten thousand buds often existing on one tree according to the estimate of Linneus Phil Bot  The vascular connection of vegetable buds with the leaves in whose bosoms they are formed is confirmed by the following experiment  Oct  On the extremity of a young bud of the Mimosa sensitive plant a small drop of acid of vitriol was put by means of a pen and after a few seconds the leaf in whose axilla it dwelt closed and opened no more though the drop of vitriolic acid was so small as apparently only to injure the summit of the bud Does not this seem to shew that the leaf and its bud have connecting vessels though they arise at different times and from different parts of the medulla or pith And as it exists previously to it that the leaf is the parent of the bud  This placentation of vegetable buds is clearly evinced from the sweetness of the rising sap and from its ceasing to rise as soon as the leaves are expanded and thus compleats the analogy between buds and bulbs Nor need we wonder at the length of the umbilical cords of buds since that must correspond with their situation on the tree in the same manner as their lymphatics and arteries are proportionally elongated  It does not appear probable that any umbilical artery attends these placental absorbents since as there seems to be no system of veins in vegetables to bring back the blood from the extremities of their arteries except their pulmonary veins there could not be any vegetable fluids to be returned to their placenta which in vegetables seems to be simply an organ for nutrition whereas the placenta of the animal foetus seems likewise to serve as a respiratory organ like the gills of fishes  NOTE XXXVIVEGETABLE CIRCULATION  And refluent blood in milky eddies bends  CANTO IV  l  THE individuality of vegetable buds was spoken of before and is confirmed by the method of raising all kinds of trees by Mr Barnes Method of propagating Fruit Trees Lond Baldwin He cut a branch into as many pieces as there were buds or leaves upon it and wiping the two wounded ends dry he quickly applied to each a cement previously warmed a little which consisted principally of pitch and planted them in the earth The use of this cement I suppose to consist in its preventing the bud from bleeding to death though the author ascribes it to its antisceptic quality  These buds of plants which are thus each an individual vegetable in many circumstances resemble individual animals but as animal bodies are detached from the earth and move from place to place in search of food and take that food at considerable intervals of time and prepare it for their nourishment within their own bodies after it is taken it is evident they must require many organs and powers which are not necessary to a stationary bud As vegetables are immoveably fixed to the soil from whence they draw their mourishment ready prepared and this uniformly not at returning intervals it follows that in examining their anatome we are not to look for muscles of locomotion as arms and legs nor for organs to receive and prepare their nourishment as a stomach and bowels nor for a reservoir for it after it is prepared as a general system of veins which in locomotive animals contains and returns the superfluous blood which is left after the various organs of secretion have been supplied by which contrivance they are enabled to live a long time without new supplies of food  The parts which we may expect to find in the anatome of vegetables correspondent to those in the animal economy are A system of absorbent vessels to imbibe the moisture of the earth similar to the lacteal vessels as in the roots of plants and another system of absorbents similar to the lymphatics of animal bodies opening its mouths on the internal cells and external surfaces of vegetables and a third system of absorbent vessels correspondent with those of the placentation of the animal foetus A pulmonary system correspondent to the lungs or gills of quadrupeds and fish by which the fluid absorbed by the lacteals and lymphatics may be exposed to the influence of the air this is done by the green leaves of plants those in the air resembling lungs and those in the water resembling gills and by the petals of flowers Arterial systems to convey the fluid thus elaborated to the various glands of the vegetable for the purposes of its growth nutrition and various secretions The various glands which separate from the vegetable blood the honey wax gum resin starch sugar essential oil c The organs adapted for their propagation or reproduction Muscles to perform several motions of their parts  I The existence of that branch of the absorbent vessels of vegetables which resembles the lacteals of animal bodies and imbibes their nutriment from the moist earth is evinced by their growth so long as moisture is applied to their roots and their quickly withering when it is withdrawn  Besides these absorbents in the roots of plants there are others which open their mouths on the external surfaces of the bark and leaves and on the internal surfaces of all the cells and between the bark and the alburnum or sapwood the existence of these is shewn because a leaf plucked off and laid with its under side on water will not wither so soon as if left in the dry airthe same if the bark alone of a branch which is separated from a tree be kept moist with waterand lastly by moistening the alburnum or sapwood alone of a branch detached from a tree it will not so soon wither as if left in the dry air By the following experiment these vessels were agreeably visible by a common magnifying glass I placed in the summer of the footstalks of some large figleaves about an inch deep in a decoction of madder rubia tinctorum and others in a decoction of logwood haematoxylum campechense along with some sprigs cut off from a plant of picris these plants were chosen because their blood is white after some hours and on the next day on taking out either of these and cutting off from its bottom about a quarter of an inch of the stalk an internal circle of red points appeared which were the ends of absorbent vessels coloured red with the decoction while an external ring of arteries was seen to bleed out hastily a milky juice and at once evinced both the absorbent and arterial system These absorbent vessels have been called by Grew and Malphigi and some other philosophers bronchi and erroneously supposed to be airvessels It is probable that these vessels when cut through may effuse their fluids and receive air their sides being too stiff to collapse since dry wood emits airbubles in the exhausted receiver in the same manner as moist wood  The structure of these vegetable absorbents consists of a spiral line and not of a vessel interrupted with valves like the animal lymphatics since on breaking almost any tender leaf and drawing out some of the fibres which adhere longest this spiral structure becomes visible even to the naked eye and distinctly so by the use of a common lens See Grew Plate  In such a structure it is easy to conceive how a vermicular or peristaltic motion of the vessel beginning at the lowest part of it each spiral ring successively contracting itself till it fills up the tube must forcibly push forwards its contents as from the roots of vines in the bleeding season and if this vermicular motion should begin at the upper end of the vessel it is as easy to see how it must carry its contained fluid in a contrary direction The retrograde motion of the vegetable absorbent vessels is shewn by cutting a forked branch from a tree and immersing a part of one of the forks in water which will for many days prevent the other from withering or it is shewn by planting a willow branch with the wrong end upwards This structure in some degree obtains in the esophagus or throat of cows who by similar means convey their food first downwards  and afterward upwards by a retrograde motion of the annular muscles or cartilages for the purpose of a second mastication of it  II The fluids thus drank up by the vegetable absorbent vessels from the earth or from the atmosphere or from their own cells and interstices are carried to the footstalk of every leaf where the absorbents belonging to each leaf unite into branches forming so many pulmonary arteries and are thence dispersed to the extremities of the leaf as may be seen in cutting away slice after slice the footstalk of a horsechesnut in September before the leaf falls There is then a compleat circulation in the leaf a pulmonary vein receiving the blood from the extremities of each artery on the upper side of the leaf and joining again in the footstalk of the leaf these veins produce so many arteries or aortas which disperse the new blood over the new bark elongating its vessels or producing its secretions but as a reservoir of blood could not be wanted by a vegetable bud which takes in its nutriment at all times I imagine there is no venous system no veins properly so called which receive the blood which was to spare and return it into the pulmonary or arterial system  The want of a system of veins was countenanced by the following experiment I cut off several stems of tall spurge Euphorbia helioscopia in autumn about the centre of the plant and observed tenfold the quantity of milky juice ooze from the upper than from the lower extremity which could hardly have happened if there had been a venous system of vessels to return the blood from the roots to the leaves  Thus the vegetable circulation complete in the lungs but probably in the other part of the system deficient in respect to a system of returning veins is carried forwards without a heart like the circulation through the livers of animals where the blood brought from the intestines and mesentery by one vein is dispersed through the liver by the vena portarum which assumes the office of an artery See Note XXXVII  At the same time so minute are the vessels in the intertexture of the barks of plants which belong to each individual bud that a general circulation may possibly exist though we have not yet been able to discover the venous part of it  There is however another part of the circulation of vegetable juices visible to the naked eye and that is in the corol or petals of flowers in which a part of the blood of the plant is exposed to the influence of the air and light in the same manner as in the foliage as will be mentioned more at large in Notes XXXVII and XXXIX  These circulations of their respective fluids seem to be carried on in the vessels of plants precisely as in animal bodies by their irritability to the stimulus of their adapted fluids and not by any mechanical or chemical attraction for their absorbent vessels propel the juice upwards which they drink up from the earth with great violence I suppose with much greater than is exerted by the lacteals of animals probably owing to the greater minuteness of these vessels in vegetables and the greater rigidity of their coats Dr Hales in the spring season cut off a vine near the ground and by fixing tubes on the remaining stump of it found the sap to rise twentyone feet in the tube by the propulsive  power of these absorbents of the roots of it Veget Stat p Such a power can not be produced by capillary attraction as that could only raise a fluid nearly to the upper edge of the attracting cylinder but not enable it to flow over that edge and much less to rise feet above it What then can this power be owing to Doubtless to the living activity of the absorbent vessels and to their increased vivacity from the influence of the warmth of the spring succeeding the winter's cold and their thence greater susceptibility to irritation from the juices which they absorb resembling in all circumstances the action of the living vessels of animals  NOTE XXXVIIVEGETABLE RESPIRATION  While spread in air the leaves respiring play  CANTO IV  l  I THERE have been various opinions concerning the use of the leaves of plants in the vegetable oeconomy Some have contended that they are perspiratory organs this does not seem probable from an experiment of Dr Hales Veg Stat p He found by cutting off branches of trees with apples on them and taking off the leaves that an apple exhaled about as much as two leaves the surfaces of which were nearly equal to the apple whence it would appear that apples have as good a claim to be termed perspiratory organs as leaves Others have believed them excretory organs of excrementious juices but as the vapour exhaled from vegetables has no taste this idea is no more probable than the other add to this that in moist weather they do not appear to perspire or exhale at all  The internal surface of the lungs or airvessels in men are said to be equal to the external surface of the whole body or about fifteen square feet on this surface the blood is exposed to the influence of the respired air through the medium however of a thin pellicle by this exposure to the air it has its colour changed from deep red to bright scarlet and acquires something so necessary to the existence of life that we can live scarcely a minute without this wonderful process  The analogy between the leaves of plants and the lungs or gills of animals seems to embrace so many circumstances that we can scarcely withhold our assent to their performing similar offices  The great surface of the leaves compared to that of the trunk and branches of trees is such that it would seem to be an organ well adapted for the purpose of exposing the vegetable juices to the influence of the air this however we shall see afterwards is probably performed only by their upper surfaces yet even in this case the surface of the leaves in general bear a greater proportion to the surface of the tree than the lungs of animals to their external surfaces  In the lungs of animal the blood after having been exposed to the air in the extremities of pulmonary artery is changed in colour from deep red to bright scarlet and certainly in some of its essential properties it is then collected by the pulmonary vein and returned to the heart To shew a similarity of circumstance in the leaves of plants the following experiment was made June A stalk with leaves and seedvessels of large spurge Euphorbia helioscopia had been several days placed in a decoction of madder Rubia tinctorum so that the lower part of the stem and two of the undermost leaves were immersed in it After having washed the immersed leaves in clear water I could readily discern the colour of the madder passing along the middle rib of each leaf This red artery was beautifully visible both on the under and upper surface of the leaf but on the upper side many red branches were seen going from it to the extremities of the leaf which on the other side were not visible except by looking through it against the light On this under side a system of branching vessels carrying a pale milky fluid were seen coming from the extremities of the leaf and covering the whole underside of it and joining into two large veins one on each side of the red artery in the middle rib of the leaf and along with it descending to the footstalk or petiole On slitting one of these leaves with scissars and having a common magnifying lens ready the milky blood was seen oozing out of the returning veins on each side of the red artery in the middle rib but none of the red fluid from the artery  All these appearances were more easily seen in a leaf of Picris treated in the same manner for in this milky plant the stems and middle rib of the leaves are sometimes naturally coloured reddish and hence the colour of the madder seemed to pass further into the ramifications of their leafarteries and was there beautifully visible with the returning branches of milky veins on each side  From these experiments the upper surface of the leaf appeared to be the immediate organ of respiration because the coloured fluid was carried to the extremities of the leaf by vessels most conspicuous on the upper surface and there changed into a milky fluid which is the blood of the plant and then returned by concomitant veins on the under surface which were seen to ooze when divided with scissars and which in Picris particularly render the under surface of the leaves greatly whiter than the upper one  As the upper surface of leaves constitutes the organ of respiration on which the sap is exposed in the terminations of arteries beneath a thin pellicle to the action of the atmosphere these surfaces in many plants strongly repel moisture as cabbageleaves whence the particles of rain lying over their surfaces without touching them as observed by Mr Melville Essays Literary and Philosop Edinburgh have the appearance of globules of quicksilver And hence leaves laid with the upper surfaces on water wither as soon as in the dry air but continue green many days if placed with the under surfaces on water as appears in the experiments of Mons Bonnet Usage des Fevilles Hence some aquatic plants as the Waterlily Nymphoea have the lower sides of their leaves floating on the water while the upper surfaces remain dry in the air  As those insects which have many spiracula or breathing apertures as wasps and flies are immediately suffocated by pouring oil upon them I carefully covered with  oil the surfaces of several leaves of Phlomis of Portugal Laurel and Balsams and though it would not regularly adhere I found them all die in a day or two  Of aquatic leaves see Note on Trapa and on Fucus in Vol II to which must be added that many leaves are furnished with muscles about their footstalks to turn their upper surfaces to the air or light as Mimosa and Hedysarum gyrans From all these analogies I think there can be no doubt but that leaves of trees are their lungs giving out a phlogistic material to the atmosphere and absorbing oxygene or vital air  The great use of light to vegetation would appear from this theory to be by disengaging vital air from the water which they perspire and thence to facilitate its union with their blood exposed beneath the thin surface of their leaves since when pure air is thus applied it is probable that it can be more readily absorbed Hence in the curious experiments of Dr Priestley and Mr Ingenhouze some plants purified air less than others that is they perspired less in the sunshine and Mr Scheele found that by putting peas into water which about halfcovered them that they converted the vital air into fixed air or carbonic acid gas in the same manner as in animal respiration See Note XXXIV  The circulation in the lungs or leaves of plants is very similar to that of fish In fish the blood after having passed through their gills does not return to the heart as from the lungs of airbreathing animals but the pulmonary vein taking the structure of an artery after having received the blood from the gills which there gains a more florrid colour distributes it to the other parts of their bodies The same structure occurs in the livers of fish whence we see in those animals two circulations independent of the power of the heart viz that beginning at the termination of the veins of the gills and branching through the muscles and that which passes through the liver both which are carried on by the action of those respective arteries and veins Monro's Physiology of Fish p  The course of the fluids in the roots leaves and buds of vegetables seems to be performed in a manner similar to both these First the absorbent vessels of the roots and surfaces unite at the footstalk of the leaf and then like the Vena Portarum an artery commences without the intervention of a heart and spreads the sap in its numerous ramifications on the upper surface of the leaf here it changes its colour and properties and becomes vegetable blood and is again collected by a pulmonary vein on the under surface of the leaf This vein like that which receives the blood from the gills of fish assumes the office and name of an artery and branching again disperses the blood upward to the bud from the footstalk of the leaf and downward to the roots where it is all expended in the various secretions the nourishment and growth of the plant as fast as it is prepared  II The organ of respiration already spoken of belongs particularly to the shoots or buds but there is another pulmonary system perhaps totally independent of the green foliage which belongs to the fructification only I mean the corol or petals In this there is an artery belonging to each petal which conveys the vegetable blood to its extremities exposing it to the light and air under a delicate membrane covering the internal surface of the petal where it often changes its colour as is beautifully seen in some partycoloured  poppies though it is probable some of the iridescent colours of flowers may be owing to the different degrees of tenuity of the exterior membrane of the leaf refracting the light like soapbubbles the vegetable blood is then returned by correspondent vegetable veins exactly as in the green foliage for the purposes of the important secretions of honey wax the finer essential oil and the prolific dust of the anthers  The vascular structure of the corol as above described and which is visible to the naked eye and its exposing the vegetable juices to the air and light during the day evinces that it is a pulmonary organ  As the glands which produce the prolific dust of the anthers the honey wax and frequently some odoriferous essential oil are generally attached to the corol and always fall off and perish with it it is evident that the blood is elaborated or oxygenated in this pulmonary system for the purpose of these important secretions  Many flowers as the Colchicum and Hamamelis arise naked in autumn no green leaves appearing till the ensuing spring and many others put forth their flowers and complete their impregnation early in the spring before the green foliage appears as Mezereon cherries pears which shews that these corols are the lungs belonging to the fructification  This organ does not seem to have been necessary for the defence of the stamens and pistils since the calyx of many flowers as Tragopogon performs this office and in many flowers these petals themselves are so tender as to require being shut up in the calyx during the night for what other use then can such an apparatus of vessels be designed  In the Helleborusniger Christmasrose after the seeds are grown to a certain size the nectaries and stamens drop off and the beautiful large white petals change their colour to a deep green and gradually thus become as calyx inclosing and defending the ripening seeds hence it would seem that the white vessels of the corol served the office of exposing the blood to the action of the air for the purposes of separating or producing the honey wax and prolific dust and when these were no longer wanted that these vessels coalesced like the placental vessels of animals after their birth and thus ceased to perform that office and lost at the same time their white colour Why should they loose their white colour unless they at the same time lost some other property besides that of defending the seedvessel which they still continue to defend  From these observations I am led to doubt whether green leaves be absolutely necessary to the progress of the fruitbud after the last year's leaves are fallen off The green leaves serve as lungs to the shoots and foster the new buds in their bosoms whether these buds be leafbuds or fruitbuds but in the early spring the fruitbuds expand their corols which are their lungs and seem no longer to require green leaves hence the vine bears fruit at one joint without leaves and puts out a leafbud at another joint without fruit And I suppose the green leaves which rise out of the earth in the spring from the Colchicum are for the purpose of producing the new bulb and its placenta and not for the giving maturity to the seed When currant or goosberry trees lose their leaves by the depredation of insects the fruit continues to be formed though less sweet and less in size  From these facts it appears that the flowerbud after the corol falls off which is its lungs and the stamens and nectary along with it becomes simply an uterus for the purpose of supplying the growing embryon with nourishment together with a system of absorbent vessels which bring the juices of the earth to the footstalk of the fruit and which there changes into an artery for the purpose of distributing the sap for the secretion of the saccharine or farinaceous or acescent materials for the use of the embryon At the same time as all the vessels of the different buds of trees inosculate or communicate with each other the fruit becomes sweeter and larger when the green leaves continue on the tree but the mature flowers themselves the succeeding fruit not considered perhaps suffer little injury from the green leaves being taken off as some florists have observed  That the vessels of different vegetable buds inosculate in various parts of their circulation is rendered probable by the increased growth of one bud when others in its vicinity are cut away as it thus seems to receive the nourishment which was before divided amongst many  NOTE XXXVIIIVEGETABLE IMPREGNATION  Love out their hour and leave their lives in air  CANTO IV  l  FROM the accurate experiments and observations of Spallanzani it appears that in the Spartium Junceum rushbroom the very minute seeds were discerned in the pod at least twenty days before the flower is in full bloom that is twenty days before fecundation At this time also the powder of the anthers was visible but glued fast to their summits The seeds however at this time and for ten days after the blossom had fallen off appeared to consist of a gelatinous substance On the eleventh day after the falling of the blossom the seeds became heartshape with the basis attached by an appendage to the pod and a white point at the apex this white point was on pressure found to be a cavity including a drop of liquor  On the th day the cavity which at first appeared at the apex was much enlarged and still full of liquor it also contained a very small semitransparent body of a yellowish colour gelatinous and fixed by its two opposite ends to the sides of the cavity  In a month the seed was much enlarged and its shape changed from a heart to a kidney the little body contained in the cavity was increased in bulk and was less transparent and gelatinous but there yet appeared no organization  On the th day the cavity now grown larger was quite filled with the body which was covered with a thin membrane after this membrane was removed the body appeared of a bright green and was easily divided by the point of a needle into two portions which manifestly formed the two lobes and within these attached to the lower part the exceedingly small plantule was easily perceived  The foregoing observations evince That the seeds exist in the ovarium many days before fecundation That they remain for some time solid and then a cavity containing a liquid is formed in them That after fecundation a body begins to appear within the cavity fixed by two points to the sides which in process of time proves to be two lobes containing a plantule That the ripe seed consists of two lobes adhering to a plantule and surrounded by a thin membrane which is itself covered with a husk or cuticle Spalanzani's Dissertations Vol II p  The analogy between seeds and eggs has long been observed and is confirmed by the mode of their production The egg is known to be formed within the hen long before its impregnation C F Wolf asserts that the yolk or the egg is nourished by the vessels of the mother and that it has from those its arterial and venous branches but that after impregnation these vessels gradually become impervious and obliterated and that new ones are produced from the fetus and dispersed into the yolk Haller's Physiolog Tom VIII p The young seed after fecundation I suppose is nourished in a similar manner from the gelatinous liquor which is previously deposited for that purpose the uterus of the plant producing or secreting it into a reservoir or amnios in which the embryon is lodged and that the young embryon is furnished with vessels to absorb a part of it as in the very early embryon in the animal uterus  The spawn of frogs and of fish is delivered from the female before its impregnation M Bonnet says that the male salamander darts his semen into the water where it forms a little whitish cloud which is afterwards received by the swoln anus of the female and she is fecundatedHe adds that marine plants approach near to these animals as the male does not project a fine powder but a liquor which in like manner forms a little cloud in the waterAnd further adds who knows but the powder of the stamina of certain plants may not make some impression on certain germs belonging to the animal kingdom Letter XLIII to Spalanzani Oevres Philos  Spalanzani found that the seminal fluid of frogs and dogs even when diluted with much water retained its prolific quality Whether this quality be simply a stimulus exciting the egg into animal action which may be called a vivifying principle or whether part of it be actually conjoined with the egg is not yet determined though the latter seems more probable from the frequent resemblance of the fetus to the male parent A conjunction however of both the male and female influence seems necessary for the purpose of reproduction throughout all organized nature as well in hermaphrodite insects microscopic animals and polypi and exists as well in the formation of the buds of vegetables as in the production of their seeds which is ingeniously conceived and explained by Linneus After having compared the flower to the larva of a butterfly  consisting of petals instead of wings calyxes instead of wingsheaths with the organs of reproduction and having shewn the use of the farina in fecundating the egg or seed he proceeds to explain the production of the bud The calyx of a flower he says is an expansion of the outer bark the petals proceed from the inner bark or rind the stamens from the alburnum or woody circle and the style from the pith In the production and impregnation of the seed a commixture of the secretions of the stamens and style are necessary and for the production of a bud he thinks the medulla or pith bursts its integuments and mixes with the woody part or alburnum and these forcing their passage through the rind and bark constitute the bud or viviparous progeny of the vegetable System of Vegetables translated from Linneus p  It has been supposed that the embryon vegetable after fecundation by its living activity or stimulus exerted on the vessels of the parent plant may produce the fruit or seedlobes as the animal fetus produces its placenta and as vegetable buds may be supposed to produce their umbilical vessels or roots down the bark of the tree This in respect to the production of the fruit surrounding the seeds of trees has been assimilated to the gallnuts on oakleaves and to the bedeguar on briars but there is a powerful objection to this doctrine viz that the fruit of figs all which are female in this country grow nearly as large without fecundation and therefore the embryon has in them no selfliving principle  NOTE XXXIXVEGETABLE GLANDULATION  Seeks where fine pores their dulcet balm distil  CANTO IV  l  THE glands of vegetables which separate from their blood the mucilage starch or sugar for the placentation or support of their seeds bulbs and buds or those which deposit their bitter acrid or narcotic juices for their defence from depredations of infects or larger animals or those which secrete resins or wax for their protection from moisture or frosts consist of vessels too fine for the injection or absorption of coloured fluids and have not therefore yet been exhibited to the inspection even of our glasses and can therefore only be known by their effects but one of the most curious and important of all vegetable secretions that of honey is apparent to our naked eyes though before the discoveries of Linneus the nectary or honeygland had not even acquired a name  The odoriferous essential oils of several flowers seem to have been designed for their defence against the depredations of insects while their beautiful colours were a necessary consequence of the size of the particles of their blood or of the tenuity of the exterior membrane of the petal The use of the prolific dust is now well ascertained the wax which covers the anthers prevents this dust from receiving moisture which would make it burst prematurely and thence prevent its application to the stigma as sometimes happens in moist years and is the cause of deficient fecundation both of our fields and orchards  The universality of the production of honey in the vegetable world and the very complicated apparatus which nature has constructed in many flowers as well as the acrid or deleterious juices she has furnished those flowers with as in the Aconite to protect this honey from rain and from the depredations of insects seem to imply that this fluid is of very great importance in the vegetable economy and also that it was necessary to expose it to the open air previous to its reabsorption into the vegetable vessels  In the animal system the lachrymal gland separates its fluid into the open air for the purpose of moistening the eye of this fluid the part which does not exhale is absorbed by the puncta lachrymalia and carried into the nostrils but as this is not a nutritive fluid the analogy goes no further than its secretion into the open air and its reabsorption into the system every other secreted fluid in the animal body is in part absorbed again into the system even those which are esteemed excrementitious as the urine and perspirable matter of which the latter is secreted like the honey into the external air That the honey is a nutritious fluid perhaps the most so of any vegetable production appears from its great similarity to sugar and from its affording sustenance to such numbers of insects which live upon it solely during summer and lay it up for their winter provision These proofs of its nutritive nature evince the necessity of its reabsorption into the vegetable system for some useful purpose  This purpose however has as yet escaped the researches of philosophical botanists M Pontedera believes it designed to lubricate the vegetable uterus and compares the hornlike nectaries of some flowers to the appendicle of the caecum intestinum of animals Antholog p Others have supposed that the honey when reabsorbed might serve the purpose of the liquor amnii or white of the egg as a nutriment for the young embryon or fecundated seed in its early state of existence But as the nectary is found equally general in male flowers as in female ones and as the young embryon or seed grows before the petals and nectary are expanded and after they fall off and thirdly as the nectary so soon falls off after the fecundation of the pistillum these seem to be insurmountable objections to both the abovementioned opinions  In this state of uncertainty conjectures may be of use so far as they lead to further experiment and investigation In many tribes of insects as the silkworm and perhaps in all the moths and butterflies the male and female parents die as soon as the eggs are  impregnated and excluded the eggs remaining to be perfected and hatched at some future time The same thing happens in regard to the male and female parts of flowers the anthers and filaments which constitute the male parts of the flower and the stigma and style which constitute the female part of the flower fall off and die as soon as the seeds are impregnated and along with these the petals and nectary Now the moths and butterflies abovementioned as soon as they acquire the passion and the apparatus for the reproduction of their species loose the power of feeding upon leaves as they did before and become nourished by whatby honey alone  Hence we acquire a strong analogy for the use of the nectary or secretion of honey in the vegetable economy which is that the male parts of flowers and the female parts as soon as they leave their fetusstate expanding their petals which constitute their lungs become sensible to the passion and gain the apparatus for the reproduction of their species and are fed and nourished with honey like the insects above described and that hence the nectary begins its office of producing honey and dies or ceases to produce honey at the same time with the birth and death of the stamens and the pistils which whether existing in the same or in different flowers are separate and distinct animated beings  Previous to this time the anthers with their filaments and the stigmas with their styles are in their fetusstate sustained by their placental vessels like the unexpanded leafbud with the seeds existing in the vegetable womb yet unimpregnated and the dust yet unripe in the cells of the anthers After this period they expand their petals which have been shewn above to constitute the lungs of the flower the placental vessels which before nourished the anthers and the stigmas coalesce or cease to nourish them and they now acquire blood more oxygenated by the air obtain the passion and power of reproduction are sensible to heat and cold and moisture and to mechanic stimulus and become in reality insects fed with honey similar in every respect except their being attached to the tree on which they were produced  Some experiments I have made this summer by cutting out the nectaries of several flowers of the aconites before the petals were open or had become much coloured some of these flowers near the summit of the plants produced no seeds others lower down produced seeds but they were not sufficiently guarded from the farina of the flowers in their vicinity nor have I had opportunity to try if these seeds would vegetate  I am acquainted with a philosopher who contemplating this subject thinks it not impossible that the first insects were the anthers or stigmas of flowers which hadby some means loosed themselves from their parent plant like the male flowers of Vallisneria and that many other insects have gradually in long process of time been formed from these some acquiring wings others fins and others claws from their ceaseless efforts to procure their food or to secure themselves from injury He contends that none of these changes are more incomprehensible than the transformation of tadpoles into frogs and caterpillars into butterflies  There are parts of animal bodies which do not require oxygenated blood for the purpose of their secretions as the liver which for the production of bile takes its blood  from the mesenteric veins after it must have lost the whole or a great part of its oxygenation which it had acquired in its passage through the lungs In like manner the pericarpium or womb of the flower continues to secrete its proper juices for the present nourishment of the newly animated embryonseed and the saccharine acescent or starchy matter of the fruit or seedlobes for its future growth in the same manner as these things went on before fecundation that is without any circulation of juices in the petals or production of honey in the nectary these having perished and fallen off with the male and female apparatus for impregnation  It is probable that the depredations of insects on this nutritious fluid must be injurious to the products of vegetation and would be much more so but that the plants have either acquired means to defend their honey in part or have learned to make more than is absolutely necessary for their own economy In the same manner the honeydew on trees is very injurions to them in which disease the nutritive fluid the vegetablesapjuice seems to be exsuded by a retrograde motion of the cutaneous lymphatics as in the sweating sickness of the last century To prevent the depredation of insects on honey a wealthy man in Italy is said to have poisoned his neighbour's bees perhaps by mixing arsnic with honey against which there is a most flowery declamation in Quintilian No XIII As the use of the wax is to preserve the dust of the anthers from moisture which would prematurely burst them the bees which collect this for the construction of the combs or cells must on this account also injure the vegetation of a country where they too much abound  It is not easy to conjecture why it was necessary that this secretion of honey should be exposed to the open air in the nectary or honeycup for which purpose of great an apparatus for its defence from insects and from showers became necessary This difficulty increases when we recollect that the sugar in the joints of grass in the sugarcane and in the roots of beets and in ripe fruits is produced without the exposure to the air On supposition of its serving for nutriment to the anthers and stigmas it may thus acquire greater oxygenation for the purpose of producing greater powers of sensibility according to a doctrine lately advanced by a French philosopher who has endeavoured to shew that the oxygene or base of vital air is the constituent principle of our power of sensibility  From this provision of honey for the male and female parts of flowers and from the provision of sugar starch oil and mucilage in the fruits seedcotyledons roots and buds of plants laid up for the nutriment of the expanding fetus not only a very numerous class of insects but a great part of the larger animals procure their food and thus enjoy life and pleasure without producing pain to others for these seeds or eggs with the nutriment laid up in them are not yet endued with sensitive life  The secretions from various vegetable glands hardened in the air produce gums resins and various kinds of saccharine saponaceous and waxlike substances as the gum of cherry or plumbtrees gum tragacanth from the astragalus tragacantha camphor from the laurus camphora elemi from amyris elemifera aneme from hymenoea courbaril turpentine from pistacia terebinthus balsam of Mecca from the buds of amyris opobalsamum  branches of which are placed in the temples of the East on account of their fragrance the wood is called xylobalsamum and the fruit carpobalsamum aloe from a plant of the same name myrrh from a plant not yet described the remarkably elastic resin is brought into Europe principally in the form of flasks which look like black leather and are wonderfully elastic and not penetrable by water rectified ether dissolves it its flexibility is encreased by warmth and destroyed by cold the tree which yields this juice is the jatropha elastica it grows in Guaiana and the neighbouring tracts of America its juice is said to resemble wax in becoming soft by heat but that it acquires no elasticity till that property is communicated to it by a secret art after which it is poured into moulds and well dried and can no longer be rendered fluid by heat Mr de la Borde physician at Cayenne has given this account Manna is obtained at Naples from the fraxinus ornus or mannaash it partly issues spontaneously which is preferred and partly exsudes from wounds made purposely in the month of August many other plants yield manna more sparingly sugar is properly made from the saccharum officinale or sugarcane but is found in the roots of beet and many other plants American wax is obtained from the myrica cerifera candleberry myrtle the berries are boiled in water and a green wax separates with luke warm water the wax is yellow the seed of croton sebiferum are lodged in tallow there are many other vegetable exsudations used in the various arts of dyeing varnishing tanning lacquering and which supply the shop of the druggist with medicines and with poisons  There is another analogy which would seem to associate plants with animals and which perhaps belongs to this Note on Glandulation I mean the similarity of their digestive powers In the roots of growing vegetables as in the process of making malt the farinaceous part of the seed is converted into sugar by the vegetable power of digestion in the same manner as the farinaceous matter of seeds are converted into sweet chyle by the animal digestion The sapjuice which rises in the vernal months from the roots of trees through the alburnum or sapwood owes its sweetness I suppose to a similar digestive power of the absorbent system of the young buds This exists in many vegetables in great abundance as in vines sycamore birch and most abundantly in the palmtree Isert's Voyage to Guinea and seems to be a similar fluid in all plants as chyle is similar in all animals  Hence as the digested food of vegetables consists principally of sugar and from that is produced again their mucilage starch and oil and since animals are sustained by these vegetable productions it would seem that the sugarmaking process carried on in vegetable vessels was the great source of life to all organized beings And that if our improved chemistry should ever discover the art of making sugar from fossile or aerial matter without the assistance of vegetation food for animals would then become as plentiful as water and mankind might live upon the earth as thick as blades of grass with no restraint to their numbers but the want of local room  It would seem that roots fixed in the earth and leaves innumerable waving in the air were necessary forthe decomposition of water and the conversion of it into saccharine  matter which would have been not only cumberous but totally incompatible with the locomotion of animal bodies For how could a man or quadruped have carried on his head or back a forest of leaves or have had long branching lacteal or absorbent vessels terminating in the earth Animals therefore subsist on vegetables that is they take the matter so far prepared and have organs to prepare it further for the purposes of higher animation and greater sensibility In the same manner the apparatus of green leaves and long roots were found inconvenient for the more animated and sensitive parts of vegetableflowers I mean the anthers and stigmas which are therefore separate beings endued with the passion and power of reproduction with lungs of their own and fed with honey a food ready prepared by the long roots and green leaves of the plant and presented to their absorbent mouths  From this outline a philosopher may catch a glimpse of the general economy of nature and like the mariner cast upon an unknown shore who rejoiced when he saw the print of a human foot upon the sand he may cry out with rapture "A GOD DWELLS HERE"  The following is an Addition to the Note on Coal No XXIII  FROM this account of the production of coals from morasses it would appear that coalbeds are not to be expected beneath masses of limestone Nevertheless I have been lately informed by my friend Mr Michell of Thornhill who I hope will soon favour the public with his geological investigations that the beds of chalk are the uppermost of all the limestones and that they rest on the granulated limestone called kettonstone which I suppose is similar to that which covers the whole country from Leadenham to Sleaford and from Sleaford to Lincoln and that thirdly coaldelphs are frequently found beneath these two uppermost beds of limestone  Now as the beds of chalk and of granulated limestone may have been formed by alluviation on or beneath the shores of the sea or in vallies of the land it would seem that some coal countries which in the great commotions of the earth had been sunk beneath the water were thus covered with alluvial limestone as well as others with alluvial basaltes or common gravelbeds Very extensive plains which now consist of alluvial materials were in the early times covered with water which has since diminished as the solid parts of the earth have increased For the solid parts of the earth consisting chiefly of animal and vegetable recrements must have originally been formed or produced from the water by animal and vegetable processes and as the solid parts of the earth may be supposed to be thrice as heavy as water it follows that thrice the quantity of water must have vanished compared with the quantity of earth thus produced This may account for many immense beds of alluvial materials as gravel rounded sand granulated limestone and chalk covering such extensive plains as Lincolnheath having become dry without the supposition of their having been again elevated from the ocean At the same time we acquire the knowledge of one of the uses or final causes of the organized world not indeed very flattering to our vanity that it converts water into earth forming islands and continents by its recrements or exuviae  NOTES OMITTED  Expiring groans  p l Mr Savery or Mr Volney

dust the male fovilla is received by the prolific lymph of the stigma and produces the seed or egg which is nourished in the ovary System of Vegetables translated from Linneus by the Lichfield Society p  Wound them ye Sylphs  p It is customary to debark oaktrees in the spring which are intended to be felled in the ensuing autumn because the bark comes off easier at this season and the sapwood or alburnum is believed to become harder and more durable if the tree remains till the end of summer The trees thus stripped of their bark put forth shoots as usual with acorns on the th th and th joint like vines but in the branches I examined the joints of the debarked trees were much shorter than those of other oaktrees the acorns were more numerous and no new buds were produced above the joints which bore acorns From hence it appears that the branches of debarked oaktrees produce fewer leafbuds and more flowerbuds which last circumstance I suppose must depend on their being sooner or later debarked in the vernal months And secondly that the new buds of debarked oaktrees continue to obtain moisture from the alburnum after the season of the ascent of sap in other vegetables ceases which in this unnatural state of the debarked tree may act as capillary tubes like the alburnum of the small debarked cylinder of a peartree abovementioned or may continue to act as placental vessels as happens to the animal embryon in cases of superfetation when the fetus continues a month or two in the womb beyond its usual time of which some instances have been recorded the placenta continues to supply perhaps the double office both of nutrition and of respiration  With new prolific power  p l About Midsummer the new buds are formed but it is believed by some of the Linnean school that these buds may in their early state be either converted into flowerbuds or leafbuds according to the vigour of the vegetating branch Thus if the upper part of a branch be cut away the buds near the extremity of the remaining stem having a greater proportional supply of nutriment or possessing a greater facility of shooting their roots or absorbent vessels down the bark will become leafbuds which might otherwise have been flowerbuds And the contrary as explained in note on l of this Canto  Closed in the style  p l  I conceive the medulla of a plant to consist of a bundle of nervous fibres and that the propelling vital power separates their uppermost extremities These diverging penetrate the bark which is now gelatinous and become multiplied in the new gem or leafbud The ascending vessels of the bark being thus divided by the nervous fibres which perforate it and the ascent of its fluids being thus impeded the bark is extended into a leaf But the flower is produced when the protrusion of the medulla is greater than the retention of the including cortical part whence the substance of the bark is expanded in the calyx that of the rind or interior bark in the corol that of the wood in the stamens that of the medulla in the pistil Vegetation thus terminates in the production of new life the ultimate medullary and cortical fibres being collected in the seeds  Linnei Systema Veget p edit  Diana's trees  p l The chemists and astronomers from the earliest antiquity have used the same characters to represent the metals and the planets which were most probably outlines or abstracts of the original hieroglyphic figures of Egypt These afterwards acquired niches in their temples and represented Gods as well as metals and planets whence silver is called Diana or the moon in the books of alchemy  The process for making Diana's silver tree is thus described by Lemeri Dissolve one ounce of pure silver in acid of nitre very pure and moderately strong mix this solution with about twenty ounces of distilled water add to this two ounces of mercury and let it remain at rest In about four days there will form upon the mercury a tree of silver with branches imitating vegetation  As the mercury has a greater affinity than silver with the nitrous acid the silver becomes precipitated and being deprived of the nitrous oxygene by the mercury sinks down in its metallic form and lustre The attraction between silver and mercury which causes them readily to amalgamate together occasions the precipitated silver to adhere to the surface of the mercury in preference to any other part of the vessel The attraction of the particles of the precipitated silver to each other causes the beginning branches to thicken and elongate into trees and shrubs rooted on the mercury For other circumstances concerning this beautiful experiment see Mr Keir's Chemical Dictionary art Arbor Dianae a work perhaps of greater utility to mankind than the lost Alexandrian Library the continuation of

planets were struck off from the sun by comets why no new planets are ejected from the sun some comets and the georgium sidus may be of later date Sun's matter decreased Mr Ludlam's opinion that it is possible the moon might be projected from the earth  NOTE XVICALCAREOUS EARTH  HIGH mountains and deep mines replete with shells the earth's nucleus covered with limestone animals convert water into limestone all the calcareous earth in the world formed in animal and vegetable bodies solid parts of the earth increase the water decreases tops of calcareous mountains dissolved whence spar marbles chalk stalactites whence alabaster fluor flint granulated limestone from solution of their angles and by attrition tupha deposited on moss limestones from shells with animals  in them liverstone from

morasses from fallen woods account by the Earl Cromartie of a new morass morasses lose their salts by solution in water then their iron their vegetable acid is converted into marine nitrous and vitriolic acids whence gypsum alum sulphur into fluoracid whence fluor into siliceous acid whence flint the sand of the sea and other strata of siliceous sand and marl some morasses ferment like new hay and subliming their phlogistic part form coalbeds above and clay below which are also produced by elutriation shellfish in some morasses hence shells sometimes found on coals and over ironstone

cause of evaporation thermometer cooled by evaporation of ether heat given from steam to the wormtub warmth accompanying rain Steam condensed on the eduction of heat moisture on cold walls southwest and northeast winds Solution of salt and of blue vitriol in the matter of heat II Other vapours may precipitate steam and form rain Cold the principal cause of devaporation hence the steam dissolved in heat is precipitated but that dissolved in air remains even in frosts southwest wind Northeast winds mixing with southwest winds produce rain because the cold particles of air of the northeast acquire some of the matter of heat from the southwest winds Devaporation from mechanical expansion of air as in the receiver of an airpump summerclouds appear and vanish when the barometers sink without change of wind the weather becomes colder Solution of water in electric fluid dubious Barometer sinks from the lessened gravity of the air and from the rain having less pressure as it falls a mixture of a solution of water in calorique with an aerial solution of water is lighter than dry air breath of animals in cold weather why condensed into visible vapour and dissolved again  NOTE XXVISPRINGS  LOWEST strata of the earth appear on the highest hills springs from dews sliding between them mountains are colder than plains from their being insulated in the air from their enlarged surface from the rarety of the air it becomes a better conductor of heat by the air on mountains being mechanically rarefied as it ascends gravitation of the matter of heat the dashing of clouds

ADVERTISEMENT  THE general design of the following sheets is to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science and to lead her votaries from the looser analogies which dress out the imagery of poetry to the stricter ones which form the ratiocination of philosophy While their particular design is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of BOTANY by introducing them to the vestibule of that delightful science and recommending to their attention the immortal works of the Swedish Naturalist LINNEUS  In the first Poem or Economy of Vegetation the physiology of Plants is delivered and the operation of the Elements as far as they may be supposed to affect the growth of Vegetables But the publication of this part is deferred to another year for the purpose of repeating some experiments on vegetation mentioned in the notes In the second poem or LOVES OF THE PLANTS which is here presented to the Reader the Sexual System of LINNEUS is explained with the remarkable properties of many particular plants  The author has withheld this work excepting a few pages many years from the press according to the rule of Horace hoping to have rendered it more worthy the acceptance of the publicbut finds at length that he is less able from disuse to correct the poetry and from want of leizure to amplify the annotations  In this second edition the plants Amaryllis Orchis and Cannabis are inserted with two additional prints of flowers some alterations are made in Gloriosa and Tulipa and the description of the Saltmines in Poland is removed to the first poem on the Economy of Vegetation  PREFACE  LINNEUS has divided the vegetable world into Classes these Classes into about Orders these Orders contain about Families or Genera and these Families about Species besides the innumerable Varieties which the accidents of climate or cultivation have added to these Species  The Classes are distinguished from each other in this ingenious system by the number situation adhesion or reciprocal proportion of the males in each flower The Orders in many of these Classes are distinguished by the number or other circumstances of the females The Families or Genera are characterized by the analogy of all the parts of the flower or fructification The Species are distinguished by the foliage of the plant and the Varieties by any accidental circumstance of colour taste or odour the seeds of these do not always produce plants similar to the parent as in our numerous fruittrees and garden flowers which are propagated by grafts or layers  The first eleven Classes include the plants in whose flowers both the sexes reside and in which the Males or Stamens are neither united nor unequal in height when at maturity and are therefore distinguished from each other simply by the number of males in each flower as is seen in the annexed PLATE copied from the Dictionaire Botanique of M BULLIARD in which the numbers of each division refer to the Botanic Classes  CLASS I ONE MALE  Monandria  includes the plants which posses but One Stamen in each flower  II Two MALES  Diandria  Two Stamens  III THREE MALES  Triandria  Three Stamens  IV FOUR MALES  Tetrandria  Four Stamens  V FIVE MALES  Pentandria  Five Stamens  VI Six MALES  Hexandria  Six Stamens  VII SEVEN MALES  Heptandria  Seven Stamens  VIII EIGHT MALES  Octandria  Eight Stamens  IX NINE MALES  Enneandria  Nine Stamens  X TEN MALES  Decandria  Ten Stamens  XI TWELVE MALES  Dodecandria  Twelve Stamens  The next two Classes are distinguished not only by the number of equal and disunited males as in the above eleven Classes but require an additional circumstance to be attended to  viz  whether the males or stamens be situated on the calyx or not  XII TWENTY MALES  Icosandria  Twenty Stamens inserted on the calyx or flowercup as is well seen in the last Figure of No xii in the annexed Plate  XIII MANY MALES  Polyandria  From to Stamens which do not adhere to the calyx as is well seen in the first Figure of No xiii in the annexed Plate  In the next two Classes not only the number of stamens are to be observed but the reciprocal proportions in respect to height  XIV Two POWERS  Didynamia  Four Stamens of which two are lower than the other two as is seen in the two first Figures of No xiv  XV FOUR POWERS  Tetradynamia  Six Stamens of which four are taller and the two lower ones opposite to each other as is seen in the third Figure of the upper row in No  The five subsequent Classes are distinguished not by the number of the males or stamens but by their union or adhesion either by their anthers or filaments or to the female or pistil  XVI ONE BROTHERHOOD  Monadelphia  Many Stamens united by their filaments into one company as in the second Figure below of No xvi  XVII Two BROTHERHOODS  Diadelphia  Many Stamens united by their filaments into two Companies as in the uppermost Fig No xvii  XVIII MANY BROTHERHOODS  Polyadelphia  Many Stamens united by their filaments into three or more companies as in No xviii  XIX CONFEDERATE MALES  Syngenesia  Many Stamens united by their anthers as in first and second Figures No xix  XX FEMININE MALES  Gynandria  Many Stamens attached to the pistil  The next three Classes consist of plants whose flowers contain but one of the sexes or if some of them contain both sexes there are other flowers accompanying them of but one sex  XXI ONE HOUSE  Monoecia  Male flowers and female flowers separate but on the same plant  XXII Two HOUSES  Dioecia  Male flowers and female flowers separate on different plants  XXIII POLYGAMY  Polygamia  Male and female flowers on one or more plants which have at the same time flowers of both sexes  The last Class contains the plants whose flowers are not discernible  XXIV CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE  Cryptogamia  The Orders of the first thirteen Classes are founded on the number of Females or Pistils and distinguished by the names ONE FEMALE  Monogynia  Two FEMALES  Digynia  THREE FEMALES  Trigynia c  as is seen in No which represents a plant of one male one female and in the first Figure of No xi which represents a flower with twelve males and three females for where the pistils have no apparent styles the summits or stigmas are to be numbered and in the first Figure of No xii which represents a flower with twenty males and many females and in the last Figure of the same No which has twenty males and one female and in No xiii which represents a flower with many males and many females  The Class of Two POWERS is divided into two natural Orders into such as have their seeds naked at the bottom of the calyx or flower cup and such as have their seeds covered as is seen in No xiv Fig and  The Class of FOUR POWERS is divided also into two Orders in one of these the seeds are inclosed in a silicule as in  Shepherd's purse  No xiv Fig In the other they are inclosed in a silique as in  Wallflower  Fig  In all the other Classes excepting the Classes Confederate Males and Clandestine Marriage as the character of each Class is distinguished by the situations of the males the character of the Orders is marked by the numbers of them In the Class ONE BROTHERHOOD No xvi Fig the Order of ten males is represented And in the Class Two BROTHERHOODS No xvii Fig the Order ten males is represented  In the Class CONFEDERATE MALES the Orders are chiefly distinguished by the fertility or barrenness of the florets of the disk or ray of the compound flower  And in the Class of CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE the four Orders are termed FFRNS MOSSES FLAGS and FUNGUSSES  The Orders are again divided into Genera or Families which are all natural associations and are described from the general resemblances of the parts of fructification in respect to their number form situation and reciprocal proportion These are the Calyx or Flowercup as seen in No iv Fig No x Fig and No xiv Fig Second the Corol or Blossom as seen in No i ii c Third the Males or Stamens as in No iv Fig and No viii Fig Fourth the Females or Pistils as in No i No xii Fig No xiv Fig No xv Fig Fifth the Pericarp or Fruitvessel as No xv Fig No xvii Fig Sixth the Seeds  The illustrious author of the Sexual System of Botany in his preface to his account of the Natural Orders ingeniously imagines that one plant of each Natural Order was created in the beginning and that the intermarriages of these produced one plant of every Genus or Family and that the intermarriages of these Generic or Family plants produced all the Species and lastly that the intermarriages of the individuals of the Species produced the Varieties  In the following POEM the name or number of the Class or Order of each plant is printed in italics as "  Two  brother swains" "  One  House contains them" and the word "  secret  " expresses the Class of Clandestine Marriage  The Reader who wishes to become further acquainted with this delightful field of science is advised to study the words of the Great Master and is apprized that they are exactly and literally translated into English by a Society at LICHFIELD in four Volumes Octavo  To the SYSTEM OF VEGETABLES is prefixed a copious explanation of all the Terms used in Botany translated from a thesis of Dr ELMSGREEN with the plates and references from the Philosophia Botannica of LINNEUS  To the FAMILIES OF PLANTS is prefixed a Catalogue of the names of plants and other Botanic Terms carefully accented to shew their proper pronunciation a work of great labour and which was much wanted not only by beginners but by proficients in BOTANY  The SYSTEM OF

dancing on a whited canvas and magnisied into apparent lifeif thou art perfectly at leasure for such trivial amusement walk in  and view the wonders of my INCHANTED GARDEN  Whereas P OVIDIUS NASO a great Necromancer in the famous Court of AUGUSTUS CAESAR did by art poetic transmute Men Women and even Gods and Goddesses into Trees and Flowers I have undertaken by similar art to restore some of them to their original animality after having remained prisoners so long in their respective vegetable mansions and have here exhibited them before thee Which thou may'st contemplate as diverse little pictures suspended over the chimney of a Lady's dressingroom  connected only by a slight festoon of ribbons  And which  though thou may'st not be acquainted with the originals may amuse thee by the beauty of their persons their graceful attitudes or the brilliancy of their dress  FAREWELL  THE LOVES OF THE PLANTS  CANTO I  DESCEND ye hovering Sylphs aerial Quires  And sweep with little hands your silver lyres  With fairy footsteps print your grassy rings  Ye Gnomes accordant to the tinkling strings  While in soft notes I tune to oaten reed  Gay hopes and amorous sorrows of the mead  From giant Oaks that wave their branches dark  To the dwarf Moss that clings upon their bark  What Beaux and Beauties crowd the gaudy groves  And woo and win their vegetable Loves  Vegetable Loves  l Linneus the celebrated Swedish naturalist has demonstrated that all flowers contain families of males or females or both and on their marriages has constructed his invaluable system of Botany  How Snowdrops cold and blueeyed Harebels blend  Their tender tears as o'er the stream they bend  The lovesick Violet and the Primrose pale  Bow their sweet heads and whisper to the gale  With secret sighs the Virgin Lily droops  And jealous Cowslips hang their tawny cups  How the young Rose in beauty's damask pride  Drinks the warm blushes of his bashful bride  With honey'd lips enamour'd Woodbines meet  Clasp with fond arms and mix their kisses sweet  Stay thy softmurmuring waters gentle Rill  Hush whispering Winds ye rustling Leaves be still  Rest silver Butterflies your quivering wings  Alight ye Beetles from your airy rings  Ye painted Moths your goldeyed plumage furl  Bow your wide horns your spiral trunks uncurl  Glitter ye Glowworms on your mossy beds  Descend ye Spiders on your lengthen'd threads  Slide here ye horned Snails with varnish'd shells  Ye Beenymphs listen in your waxen cells  BOTANIC MUSE who in this latter age  Led by your airy hand the Swedish sage  Bad his keen eye your secret haunts explore  On dewy dell high wood and winding shore  Say on each leaf how tiny Graces dwell  How laugh the Pleasures in a blossom's bell  How insect Loves arise on cobweb wings  Aim their light shafts and point their little stings  "First the tall CANNA lifts his curled brow  Canna  l Cane or Indian Reed One male and one female inhabit each flower It is brought from between the tropics to our hothouses and bears a beautiful crimson flower the seeds are used as shot by the Indians and are strung for prayerbeads in some catholic countries  Erect to heaven and plights his nuptial vow  The virtuous pair in milder regions born  Dread the rude blast of Autumn's icy morn  Round the chill fair he folds his crimson vest  And clasps the timorous beauty to his breast  Thy love CALLITRICHE  two  Virgins share  Callitriche  l FineHair Stargrass One male and two females inhabit each flower The upper leaves grow in form of a star whence it is called Stellaria Aquatica by Ray and others its stems and leaves flo  t far on the water and are often so matted together as to bear a person walking on them The male sometimes lives in a separate flower  Smit with thy starry eye and radiant hair  On the green margin sits the youth and laves  His floating train of tresses in the waves  Sees his fair features paint the streams that pass  And bends for ever o'er the watery glass  Two  brother swains of COLLIN'S gentle name  Collinsonia  l Two males one female I have lately observed a very singular circumstance in this flower the two males stand widely diverging from each other and the female bends herself into contact first with one of them and after some time leaves this and applies herself to the other It is probable one of the anthers may be mature before the other See note on Gloriosa and Genista The females in Nigella devil in the bush are very tall compared to the males and bending over in a circle to them give the flower some resemblance to a regal crown The female of the epilobium angustifolium rose bay willow herb bends down amongst the males for several days and becomes upright again when impregnated  The same their features and their forms the same  With rival love for fair COLLINIA sigh  Knit the dark brow and roll the unsteady eye  With sweet concern the pitying beauty mourns  And sooths with smiles the jealous pair by turns  Sweet blooms GENISTA in the myrtle shade  Genista  l Dyer's broom Ten males and one female inhabit this flower The males are generally united at the bottom in two sets whence Linneus has named the class "two brotherhoods" In the Genista however they are united in but one set The flowers of this class are called papilionaccous from their resemblance to a butterfly as the peablossom In the Spartium Scoparium or common broom I have lately observed a curious circumstance the males or stamens are in two sets one set rising a quarter of an inch above the other the upper set does not arrive at their maturity so soon as the lower and the stigma or head of the female is produced amongst the upper or immature set but as soon as the pistil grows tall enough to burst open the keelleaf or hood of the flower it bends itself round in an instant like a French horn and inserts its head or stigma amongst the lower or mature set of males The pistil or female continues to grow in length and in a few days the stigma arrives again amongst the upper set by the time they become mature This wonderful contrivance is readily seen by opening the keelleaf of the flowers of broom before they burst spontaneously See note on Collinsonia Gloriosa Draba  And  ten  fond brothers woo the haughty maid  Two  knights before thy fragrant altar bend  Adored MELISSA and  two  squires attend  Melissa  l Balm In each flower there are four males and one female two of the males stand higher than the other two whence the name of the class "two powers" I have observed in the Ballota and others of this class that the two lower stamens or makes become mature before the two higher After they have shed their dust they turn themselves away outwards and the pistil or female continuing to grow a little taller is applied to the upper stamens See Glorista and Genista  All the plants of this class which have naked seeds are aromatic The Marum and Nepeta are particularly delightful to cats no other brute animals seem pleased with any odours but those of their food or prey  MEADIA's soft chains  five  suppliant beaux confess  Meadia  l Dodecatheon American Cowslip Five males and one female The males or anthers touch each other The uncommon beauty of this flower occasioned Linneus to give it a name signifying the twelve heathen gods and Dr Mead to affix his own name to it The pistil is much longer than the stamens hence the flowerstalks have their elegant bend that the stigma may hang downwards to receive the fecundating dust of the anthers And the petals are so beautifully turned back to prevent the rain or dew drops from sliding down and washing off this dust prematurely and at the same time exposing it to the light and air As soon as the seeds are sormed it erects all the flower stalks to prevent them from salling out and thus loses the beauty of its figure Is this a mechanical effect or does it indicate a vegetable storgé to preserve its offspring See note on Ilex and Gloriosa  In the Meadia the Borago Cyclamen Solanum and many others the filaments are very short compared with the style Hence it became necessary st to furnish the stamens with long anthers d I'o lengthen and bend the peduncle or flowerstalk that the flower might hang downwards d To reflect the petals th To erect these peduncles when the germ was fecundated We may reason upon this by observing that all this apparatus might have been spared if the filaments alone had grown longer and that thence in these flowers that the filaments are the most unchangeable parts and that thence their comparative length in respect to the style would afford a most permanent mark of their generic character  And hand in hand the laughing belle address  Alike to all she bows with

perfect males or females the Verbena of our country has four males that of Sweden has but two the genus Albuca the Bignonia Catalpa Gratiola and hemlockleaved Geranium have only half their filaments crowned with anthers In like manner the florets which form the rays of the flowers of the order frustraneous polygamy of the class syngenesia or confederate males as the sunflower are furnished with a style only and no stigma and are thence barren There is also a style without a stigma in the whole order dioecia gynandria the male flowers of which are thence barren The Opulus is another plant which contains some unprolific flowers In like manner some tribes of insects have males females and neuters among them as bees wasps ants  There is a curious circumstance belonging to the class of insects which have two wings or diptera analogous to the rudiments of stamens above described viz two little knobs are found placed each on a stalk or peduncle generally under a little arched scale which appear to be rudiments of hinder wings and are called by Linneus halteres or poisers a term of his introduction A T Bladh Amaen Acad V Other animals have marks of having in a long process of time

double flowers so much admired by the florists are termed by the botanist vegetable monsters in some of these the petals are multiplied three or four times but without excluding the stamens hence they produce some seeds as Campanula and Stramoneum but in others the petals become so numerous as totally to exclude the stamens or males as Caltha Peonia and Alcea these produce no seeds and are termed eunuchs Philos Botan No  These vegetable monsters are formed in many ways st By the multiplication of the petals and the exclusion of the nectaries as in larkspur d By the multiplication of the nectaries and exclusion of the petals as in columbine d In some flowers growing in cymes the wheelshape flowers in the margin are multiplied to the exclusion of the bellshape flowers in the centre as in gelderrose th By the elongation of the florets in the centre Instances of both these are found in daily feverfew for other kinds of vegetable monsters see Plantago  The per  anth is not changed in double flowers hence the genus or family may be often disovered by the calyx as in Hepatica Ranunculus Alcea In those flowers which have many petals the lowest series of the petals remains unchanged

one filament be touched after it is separated from the floret that it will contract like the muscular fibres of animal bodies his experiments were tried on the Centauréa Calcitiapoides and on

anthers lie at a distance from the pistil and three alternate ones approach first and when these decline the other three approach in the Lithrum Salicaria which has twelve males and one female a beautiful red flower which grows on the banks of rivers six of the males arrive at maturity and surround the female some time before the other six when these decline the other six rise up and supply their places Several other flowers have in similar manner two sets of stamens of different ages as Adoxa Lychnis Saxifraga See Genista Perhaps a difference in the time of their maturity obtains in all these flowers which have numerous stamens In the Kalmia the ten stamens lie round the pistil like the radii of a wheel and each anther is concealed in a nich of the corol to protect it from cold and

flowers of this plant and of the Cucubulus Otites is a curious contrivance to prevent various insects from plundering the honey or devouring the seed In the Dionaea Muscipula there is a still more wonderful contrivance to prevent the depredations of insects The leaves are armed with long teeth like the antennae of insects and lie spread upon the ground round the stem and are so irritable that when an insect creeps upon them they fold up and crush or pierce it to death The last professor Linneus in his Supplementum Plantarum gives the following account of the Arum Muscivorum The flower has the smell of carrion by which the flies are invited to lay their eggs in the chamber of the flower but in vain endeavour to escape being prevented by the hairs pointing inwards and thus perish in the flower whence its name of flyeater P in the Dypsacus is another contrivance for this purpose a bason of water is placed round each joint of the stem In the Drosera is another kind of flytrap See

Fair AMARYLLIS flies the incumbent storm  Amaryllis  l Formosissima Most beautiful Amaryllis Six males one female Some of the bellflowers close their apertures at night or in rainy or cold weather as the convolvulus and thus protect their included stamens and pistils Other bellflowers hang their apertures downwards as many of the lilies in those the pistil when at maturity is longer than the stamens and by this pendant attitude of the bell when the anthers burst their dust falls on the stigma and these are at the same time sheltered as with an umbrella from rain and dews But as a free exposure to the air is necessary for their fecundation the style and filaments in many of these flowers continue to grow longer after the bell is open and hang down below its rim In others as in the martagon the bell is deeply divided and the divisions are reflected upwards that they may not prevent the access of air and at the same time afford some shelter from perpendicular rain or dew Other bellflowers as the hemerocallis and amaryllis have their bells nodding only as it were or hanging obliquely toward the horizon which as their stems are slender turn like a weathercock from the wind and thus very effectually preserve their inclosed stamens and anthers from the rain and cold Many of these flowers both before and after their season of fecundation erect their heads perpendicular to the horizon like the Meadia which cannot be explained from meer mechanism  The Amaryllis formosissima is a flower of the last mentioned kind and affords an agreeable example of  art  in the vegetable economy The pistil is of great length compared with the stamens and this I suppose to have been the most unchangeable part of the flower as in Meadia which see To counteract this circumstance the pistil and stamens are made to decline downwards that the prolific dust might fall from the anthers on the stigma To produce this effect and to secure it when produced the corol is lacerated contrary to what occurs in other flowers of this genus and the lowest division with the two next lowest ones are wrapped closely over the style and filaments binding them forceibly down lower toward the horizon than the usual inclination of the bell in this genus and thus constitutes a most elegant flower There is another contrivance for this purpose in the Hemeroca  lis flava the long pistil often

furnished with arms for their protection these are either aculei prickles as in rose and barberry which are formed from the outer bark of the plant or spinae thorns as in hawthorn which are an elongation of the wood and hence more difficult to be torn off than the former or stimuli stings as in the nettles which are armed with a venomous fluid for the annoyance of naked animals The shrubs and trees which have prickles or thorns are grateful food to many animals as goosberry and gorse and would be quickly devoured if not thus armed the stings seem a protection against some kinds of insects as well as the naked mouths of quadrupeds Many plants lose their thorns by cultivation as wild animals lose their ferocity and some of them their horns A curious circumstance attends the large hollies in Needwoodforest they are armed with thorny leaves about eight feet high and have smooth leaves above as if they were conscious that horses and cattle could not reach their upper branches See note on Meadia and on Mancinella The numerous clumps of hollies in Needwoodforest serve as landmarks to direct the travellers across it in various directions and as a shelter to the deer and cattle in winter and in scarce seasons supply them with much food For when the upper branches which are without prickles are cut down the deer crop the leaves and peel off the bark The birdlime made from the bark of hollies seems to be a very similar material to the elastic gum or Indian rubber as it is called There is a fossile elastic bitumen found at Matlock in Derbyshire which much resembles these

TULIPA the loud alarms  Tulipa  l Tulip What is in common language called a bulbous root is by Linneus termed the Hybernacle or Winterlodge of the young plant As these bulbs in every respect resemble buds except in their being produced under ground and include the leaves and flower in miniature which are to be expanded in the ensuing spring By cautiously cutting in the early spring through the concentric coats of a tuliproot longitudinally from the top to the base and taking them off successively the whole flower of the next summer's tulip is beautifully seen by the naked eye with its petals pistil and stamens the flowers exist in other bulbs in the same manner as in Hyacinths but the individual flowers of these being less they are not so easily dissected or so conspicuous to the

Honeysuckle Five males one female Nature has in many flowers used a wonderful apparatus to guard the nectary or honeygland from infects In the honeysuckle the petal terminates in a long tube like a cornucopiae or horn of plenty and the honey is produced at the bottom of it In Aconitum monkshood the nectaries stand upright like two horns covered with a hood which abounds with such acrid matter that no infects penetrate it In Helleborus hellebore the many nectaries are placed in a circle like little pitchers and add much to the beauty of the flower In the Columbine Aquilegia the nectary is imagined to be like the neck and body of a bird and the two petals standing upon each side to represent wings whence its name of columbine as if resembling a nest of young pigeons fluttering whilst their parent feeds them The importance of the nectary in the economy of vegetation is explained at large in the note on part the first  Many infects are provided with a long and pliant proboscis for the purpose of acquiring this grateful food as a variety of bees moths and butterflies but the Sphinx Convolvuli or unicorn moth is furnished with the most remarkable proboscis in this climate It carries it rolled up in concentric circles under its chin and occasionally extends it to above three inches in length This trunk consists of joints and muscles and seems to have more versatile movements than the trunk of the elephant and near its termination is split into two capillary tubes The excellence of this contrivance for robbing the flowers of their honey keeps this beautiful insect fat and bulky though it flies only in the evening when the flowers have closed their petals and are thence more difficult of access at the same time the brilliant colours of the moth contribute to its safety by making it mistaken by the late sleeping birds for the flower it rests on  Besides these there is a curious contrivance attending the Ophrys commonly called the Beeorchis and the Flyorchis with some kinds of the Delphinium called Beelarkspurs to preserve their honey in these the nectary and petals resemble in form and colour the insects which plunder them and thus it may be supposed they often escape these hourly robbers by having the appearance of being preoccupied See note on Rubia and Conferva polymorpha  And decks with brighter blush the vermil dawn  Winds round the

Fern is a native of China with a decumbent root thick and every where covered with the most soft and dense wool intensely yellow Lin Spec Plant  This curious stem is sometimes pushed out of the ground in its horizontal situation by some of the inferior branches of the root so as to give it some resemblance to a Lamb standing on four legs and has been said to destroy all other plants in its vicinity

edition of the Terra of Evelyn has given a more curious print of it much resembling a sheep The down is used in India externally for stopping hemorrhages and is called golden moss  The thick downy clothing of some vegetables seems designed to protect them from the injuries of cold like the wool of animals Those bodies which are bad conductors of electricity are also bad conductors of heat as glass wax air Hence either of the two former of these may be melted by the flame of a blowpipe very near the fingers which hold it without burning them and the last by being confined on the surface of animal bodies in the interstices of their fur or wool prevents the escape of their natural warmth to which should be added that the hairs themselves are imperfect conductors The fat or oil of whales and other northern animals seems designed for the same purpose of preventing the too sudden escape of the heat of the body in cold climates Snow protects vegetables which are covered by it from cold both because it is a bad conductor of heat itself and contains much air in its pores If a piece of camphor be immersed in a snowball except one extremity of it on setting fire to this as the snow

MIMOSA stands  Mimosa  l The sensitive plant Of the class Polygamy one house Naturalists have not explained the immediate cause of the collapsing of the sensitive plant the leaves meet and close in the night during the sleep of the plant or when exposed to much cold in the daytime in the same manner as when they are affected by external violence folding their upper surfaces together and in part over each other like seales or tiles so as to expose as little of the upper surface as may be to the air but do not indeed collapse quite so far since I have found when touched in the night during their sleep they fall still further especially when touched on the footstalks between the stems and the leaflets which seems to be their most sensitive or irritable part Now as their situation after being exposed to external violence resembles their sleep but with a greater degree of collapse may it not be owing to a numbness or paralysis consequent to too violent irritation like the saintings of animals from pain or fatigue I kept a sensitive plant in a dark room till some hour after daybreak its leaves and leasstalks were collapsed as in its most prosound sleep and on exposing it to the light above twenty minutes passed before the plant was thoroughly awake and had quite expanded itself During the night the upper or smoother surfaces of the leaves are appressed together this would seem to shew that the office of this surface of the leaf was to expose the fluids of the plant to the light as well as to the air See note on Helianthus Many flowers close up their petals during the

Caltha when the cuckoo sings Near the same coincidence was observed in England by Stillingfleet The word Coccux in Greek signifies both a young fig and a cuckoo which is supposed to have arisen from the coincidence of their appearance in Greece Perhaps a similar coincidence of appearance in some parts of Asia gave occasion to the story of the loves of the rose and nightingale so much celebrated by the eastern poets See Dianthus The times however of the appearance of vegetables in the spring seem occasionally to be influenced by their acquired habits as well as by their sensibility to heat for the roots of potatoes onions c will germinate with much less heat in the spring than in the autumn as is easily observable where these roots are stored for use and hence malt is best made in the spring d The grains and roots brought from more southern latitudes germinate here sooner than those which are brought from more northern ones owing to their acquired habits Fordyce on Agriculture d It was observed by one of the scholars of Linneus that the appletrees sent from hence to New England blossomed for a few years too early for that climate and bore no fruit but afterwards learnt to accommodate themselves to their new situation Kalm's Travels th The parts of animals become more sensible to heat after having been previously exposed to cold as our hands glow on coming into the house after having held snow in them this seems to happen to vegetables for vines in grapehouses which have been exposed to the winter's cold will become forwarder and more vigorous than those which have been kept during the winter in the house Kenedy on Gardening This accounts for the very rapid vegetation in the northern latitudes after the solution of the snows  The increase of the irritability of plants in respect to heat after having been previously exposed to cold is further illustrated by an experiment of Dr Walker's He cut apertures into a birchtree at different heights and on the th of March some of these apertures bled or oozed with the sapjuice when the thermometer was at which same apertures did not bleed on the th of March when the thermometer was at The reason of this I apprehend was because on the night of the th the thermometer was as low as whereas on the night of the th it was at though the ingenious author ascribes it to another cause Trans of Royal Soc

medical purposes do not seem essential to the life of the plant but seem given it as a defence against the depredations of insects or other animals to whom these materials are nauseous or deleterious To insects and many smaller animals their colours contribute to conceal them from the larger ones which prey upon them Caterpillars which feed on leaves are generally green and earthworms the colour of the earth which they inhabit Butterflies which frequent flowers are coloured like them small birds which frequent hedges have greenish backs like the leaves and light coloured bellies like the sky and are hence less visible to the hawk who passes under them or over them Those birds which are much amongst flowers as the goldfinch Fringilla carduelis are furnished with vivid colours The lark partridge hare are the colour of the dry vegetables or earth on which they rest And frogs vary their colour with the mud of the streams which they frequent and those which live on trees are green Fish which are generally suspended in water and swallows which are generally suspended in air have their backs the colour of the distant ground and their bellies of the sky In the colder climates many of

generally thought expressive of the effects of warm and cold bathing are mechanical terms properly applied to drums or strings but are only metaphors when applied to the effects of cold or warm bathing on animal bodies The immediate cause of old age seems to reside in the inirritability of the finer vessels or parts of our system hence these cease to act and collapse or become horny or bony

immense floating fields of vegetation the young ones branching out from the larger ones and borne on similar little airvessels It is also found in the warm baths of Patavia where the leaves are formed into curious cells or labyrinths for the purpose of floating on the water See ulva labyrinthiformis Lin Spec Plant The air contained in these cells was found by Dr Priestley to be sometimes purer than common air and sometimes less pure the airbladders of fish seem to be similar organs and serve to render them buoyant in the water In some of these as in the Cod and Haddock a red membrane consisting of a great number of leaves or duplicatures is sound within the airbag which probably secretes this air from the blood of the animal Monro Physiol of Fish p To determine whether this air when first separated from the blood of the animal or plant be dephlogisticated air is worthy inquiry The bladdersena Colutea and bladdernut Staphylaea have their seedvessels distended with air the Ketmia has the upper joint of the stem immediately under the receptacle of the flower much distended with air these seem to be analogous to the airvessel at the broad end of the egg and may probably become less pure as the seed ripens some which I tried had the purity of the surrounding atmosphere The air at the broad end of the egg is probably an organ serving the purposeof respiration to the young chick some of whose vessels are spread upon it like a placenta or permeate it Many are of opinion that even the placenta of the human setus and cotyledons of quadropeds are respiratory organs rather than nutritious ones  The air in the hollow stems of grasses and of some umbelliserous plants bears analogy to the air in the quills and in some of the bones of birds supplying the place of the pith which shrivels up after it has performed its office of protruding the young stem or feather Some of these cavities of the bones are said to communicate with the lungs in birds Phil Trans  The airbladders of fish are nicely adapted to their intended purpose for though they render them buoyant near the surface without the labour of using their fins yet when they rest at greater depths they are no inconvenience as the increased pressure of the water condenses the air which they contain into less space Thus if a cork or bladder of air was immersed a very great depth in the ocean it would be so much compressed as to become specially as heavy as the water and would remain there It is probable the unfortunate Mr Day who was drowned in a divingship of his own construction milcarried from not attending to this circumstance it is probable the quantity of air he took down with him if he descended much lower than he expected was condensed into so small a space as not to render the ship buoyant when he

fungusses of this Genus on old rails and on the ground to become a transparent jelly after they had been frozen in autumnal mornings which is a curious property and distinguishes them from some other vegetable mucilage for I have observed that the paste made by boiling wheatflour in water ceases to be adhesive after having been frozen I suspected that the Tremella Nostoc or starjelly also had been thus produced but have since been well informed that the Tremella Nostoc is a mucilage voided by Herons after they have eaten frogs hence it has the appearance of having been pressed through a hole and limbs of frogs are said sometimes to be found amongst it it is always seen upon plains or by the sides of water places which Herons generally frequent  Some of the Fungusses are so acrid that a drop of their juice blisters the tongue others intoxicate those who eat them The Ostiacks in Siberia use them for the latter purpose one Fungus of the species Agaricus muscarum eaten raw or the decoction of three of them produces intoxication for or hours History of Russia V I Nichols As all acrid plants become less so if exposed to a boiling heat it is probable the common mushroom may sometimes disagree from being not sufficiently stewed The Ostiacks blister their skin by a fungus found on Birchtrees and use the Agaricus officin for Soap ib  There was a dispute whether the fungusses should be classed in the animal or vegetable department Their animal taste in cookery and their animal smell when burnt together with their tendency to putrefaction insomuch that the Phallus impudicus has gained the name of stinkhorn and lastly their growing and continuing healthy without light as the Licoperdon tuber or truffle and the fungus vinosus or mucor in dark cellars and the

attempt a landskip and leave the human figure with the subjects of history to abler artists  B  It is well to know what subjects are within the limits of your pencil many have failed of success from the want of this selfknowledge But pray tell me what is the essential difference between Poetry and Prose is it solely the melody or measure of the language  P  I think not solely for some prose has its melody and even measure And good verses well spoken in a language unknown to the hearer are not easily to be distinguished from good prose  B  Is it the sublimity beauty or novelty of the sentiments  P  Not so for sublime sentiments are often better expressed in prose Thus when Warwick in one of the plays of Shakespear is left wounded on the field after the loss of the battle and his friend says to him "Oh could you but fly" what can be more sublime than his answer "Why then I would not fly" No measure of verse I imagine could add dignity to this sentiment And it would be easy to select examples of the beautiful or new from prose writers which I suppose no measure of verse could improve  B  In what then consists the essential difference between Poetry and Prose  P  Next to the measure of the language the principal distinction appears to me to consist in this that Poetry admits of but few words expressive of very abstracted ideas whereas Prose abounds with them And as our ideas derived from visible objects are more distinct than those derived from the objects of our other sense the words expressive of these ideas belonging to vision make up the principal part of poetic language That is the Poet writes principally  to the eye the Prosewriter uses more abstracted terms Mr Pope has written a bad verse in the Windsor Forest  And Kennet swift for silver Eels  renown'd  The word renown'd does not present the idea of a visible object to the mind and is thence prosaic But change this line thus  And Kennet swift where silver Graylings  play  and it becomes poetry because the scenery is then brought before the eye  B  This may be done in prose  P  And when it is done in a single word it animates the prose so it is more agreeable to read in Mr Gibbon's History  Germany was at this time  overshadowed  with extensive forests  than Germany was at this time  full  of extensive forests But where this mode of expression occurs too frequently the prose approaches to poetry and in graver works where we expect to be instructed rather than amused it becomes tedious and impertinent Some parts of Mr Burke's eloquent orations become intricate and enervated by superfluity of poetic ornament which quantity of ornament would have been agreeable in a poem where much ornament is expected  B  Is then the office of Poetry only to amuse  P  The Muses are young ladies we expect to see them dressed though not like some modern beauties with so much gauze and feather that "the Lady herself is the least part of her" There are however didactic pieces of poetry which are much admired as the Georgics of Virgil Mason's English Garden Hayley's Epistles nevertheless Science is best delivered in Prose as its mode of reasoning is from stricter analogies than metaphors or similies  B  Do not Personifications and Allegories distinguish poetry  P  These are other arts of bringing objects before the eye or of expressing sentiments in the language of vision and are indeed better suited to the pen than the pencil  B  That is strange when you have just said they are used to bring their objects before the eye  P  In poetry the personification or allegoric figure is generally indistinct and therefore does not strike us so forcibly as to make us attend to its improbability but in painting the figures being all  much more distinct their improbability becomes apparent and seizes our attention to it Thus the person of Concealment is very indistinct and therefore does not compel us to attend to its improbability in the following beautiful lines of Shakespear  She never told her love  But let Concealment like a worm i' th' bud  Feed on her damask cheek  But in these lines below the person of Reason obtrudes itself into our company and becomes disagreeable by its distinctness and conesquent improbability  To Reason I flew and intreated her aid  Who paused on my case and each circumstance weigh'd  Then gravely reply'd in return to my prayer  That Hebe was fairest of all that were fair  That's a truth reply'd I I've no need to be taught  I came to you Reason to find out a fault  If that's all says Reason return as you came  To find fault with Hebe would forfeit my name  Allegoric figures are on this account in general less manageable in painting and in statuary than in poetry and can seldom be introduced in the two former arts in company with natural figures as is evident from the ridiculous effect of many of the paintings of Rubens in the Luxemburgh gallery and for this reason because their improbability becomes more striking when there are the figures of real persons by their side to compare them with  Mrs Angelica Kauffman well apprised of this circumstance has introduced no mortal figures amongst her Cupids and her Graces And the great Roubiliac in his unrivalled monument of Time and Fame struggling for the trophy of General Fleming has only hung up a medallion of the head of the hero of the piece There are however some allegoric figures which we have so often heard described or seen delineated that we almost forget that they do not exist in common life and hence view them without astonishment as the figures of the heathen mythology of angels devils death and time and almost believe them to be realities even when they are mixed with representations of the natural forms of man Whence I conclude that a certain degree of probability is necessary to prevent us from revolting with distaste from unnatural images unless we are otherwise so much interested in the contemplation of them as not to perceive their improbability  B  Is this reasoning about degrees of probability justWhen Sir Joshua Reynolds who is unequalled both in the theory and practice of his art and who is a great master of the pen as well as the pencil has asserted in a discourse delivered to the Royal Academy December that  the higher styles of painting like the higher kinds of the Drama do not aim at any thing like deception or have any expectation that the spectators should think the events there represented are really passing before them  And he then accuses Mr Fielding of bad judgment when he attempts to compliment Mr Garrick in one of his novels by introducing an ignorant man mistaking the representation of a scene in Hamlet for a reality and  thinks because he was an ignorant man he was less liable to make such a mistake  P  It is a metaphysical question and requires more attention than Sir Joshua has bestowed upon itYou will allow that we are perfectly deceived in our dreams and that even in our waking reveries we are often so much absorbed in the contemplation of what passes in our imaginations that for a while we do not attend to the lapse of time or to our own locality and thus suffer a similar kind of deception as in our dreams That is we believe things present before our eyes which are not so  There are two circumstances which contribute to this compleat deception in our dreams First because in sleep the organs of sense are closed or inert and hence the trains of ideas associated in our imaginations are never interrupted or disserered by the irritations of external objects and can not therefore be contrasted with our sensations On this account though we are affected with a variety of passions in our dreams as anger love joy yet we never experience surprizeFor surprize is only produced when any external irritations suddenly obtrude themselves and dissever our passing trains of ideas  Secondly because in sleep there is a total suspension of our voluntary power both over the muscles of our bodies and the ideas of our minds for we neither walk about nor reason in compleat sleep Hence as the trains of ideas are passing in our imaginations in dreams we cannot compare them with our previous knowledge of things as we do in our waking hours for this is a voluntary exertion and thus we cannot perceive their incongruity  Thus we are deprived in sleep of the only two means by which we can distinguish the trains of ideas passing in our imaginations from those excited by our sensations and are led by their vivacity to believe them to belong to the latter For the vivacity of these trains of ideas passing in the imagination is greatly increased by the causes abovementioned that is by their not being disturbed or dissevered either by the appulses of external bodies as in surprize or by our voluntary exertions in comparing them with our previous knowledge of things as in reasoning upon them  B  Now to apply  P  When by the art of the Painter or Poet a train of ideas is suggested to our imaginations which interests us so much by the pain or pleasure it affords that we cease to attend to the irritations of common external objects and cease also to use any voluntary efforts to compare these interesting trains of ideas with our previous knowledge of things a compleat reverie is produced during which time however short if it be but for a moment the objects themselves appear to exist before us This I think has been called by an ingenious critic "the ideal presence" of such objects Elements of Criticism by Lord Kaimes And in respect to the compliment intended by Mr Fielding to Mr Garrick it would seem that an ignorant Rustic at the play of Hamlet who has some previous belief in the appearance of Ghosts would sooner be liable to fall into reverie and continue in it longer than one who possessed more knowledge  of the real nature of things and had a greater facility of exercising his reason  B  It must require great art in the Painter or Poet to produce this kind of deception  P  The matter must be interesting from its sublimity beauty or novelty this is the scientific part and the art consists in bringing these distinctly before the eye so as to produce as abovementioned the ideal presence of the object in which the great Shakespear particularly excells  B  Then it is not of any consequence whether the representations correspond with nature  P  Not if they so much interest the reader or spectator as to induce the reverie above described Nature may be seen in the marketplace or at the cardtable but we expect something more than this in the playhouse or pictureroom The further the artists recedes from nature the greater novelty he is likely to produce if he rises above nature he produces the sublime and beauty is probably a selection and new combination of her most agreeable parts Yourself will be sensible of the truth of this doctrine by recollecting over  in your mind the works of three of our celebrated artists Sir Joshua Reynolds has introduced sublimity even into its protraits we admire the representation of persons whose reality we should have passed by unnoticed Mrs Angelica Kauffman attracts our eyes with beauty which I suppose no where exists certainly few Grecian faces are seen in this country And the daring pencil of Fuseli transports us beyond the boundaries of nature and ravishes us with the charm of the most interesting novelty And Shakespear who excells in all these together so far captivates the spectator as to make him unmindful of every kind of violation of Time Place or Existence As at the first appearance of the Ghost of Hamlet  his ear must be dull as the fat weed which roots itself on Lethe's brink  who can attend to the improbality of the exhibition So in many scenes of the Tempest we perpetually believe the action passing before our eyes and relapse with somewhat of distaste into common life at the intervals of the representation  B  I suppose a poet of less ability would find such great machinery difficult and cumbersome to manage  P  Just so we should be shocked at the apparent improbabilities As in the gardens of a Scicilian nobleman described in Mr Brydone's and in Mr Swinburn's travels there are said to be fix hundred statues of imaginary monsters which so disgust the spectators that the state had once a serious design of destroying them and yet the very  improbable monsters in Ovid's Metamorphoses have entertained the world for many centuries  B  The monsters in your Botanic Garden I hope are of the latter kind  P

Thistle Of the class Confederate Males The feeds of this and of many other plants of the same class are furnished with a plume by which admirable mechanism they perform long aërial journeys crossing lakes and deserts and are thus disseminated far from the original plant and have much the appearance of a Shuttlecock as they fly The wings are of different construction some being like a divergent tuft of hairs others are branched like feathers some are elevated from the crown of the feed by a slender footstalk which gives them a very elegant appearance others sit immediately on the crown of the seed  Nature has many other curious vegetable contrivances for the dispersion of seeds see note on Helianthus But perhaps none of them has more the appearance of design than the admirable apparatus of Tillandsia for this purpose This plant grows on the branches of trees like the misleto and never on the ground the seeds are furnished with many long threads on their crowns which as they are driven forwards by the winds wrap round the arms of trees and thus hold them last till they vegetate This is very analogous to the migration of Spiders on the gossamer who are said to attach themselves to the end of a long thread and rise thus to the tops of trees or buildings as the accidental breezes carry them  "Bear on broad wings your Votress to the skies  "How sweetly mutable yon

now where Derwent rolls his dusky floods  Through vaulted mountains and a night of woods  The Nymph GOSSYPIA treads the velvet sod  Gossypia l  Gossypium The cotton plant On the river Derwent near Matlock in Derbyshire Sir RICHARD ARKWRIGHT has erected his curious and magnificent machinery for spinning cotton which had been in vain attempted by many ingenious artists before him The cottonwool is first picked from the pods and seeds by women It is then c  rded by  cylindrical cards  which move against each other with different velocities It is taken from these by an ironhand or comb which has a motion similar to that of scratching and takes the wool off the cards longitudinally in respect to the fibres or staple producing a continued line loosely cohering called the  Rove  or  Roving  This Rove yet very loosely twisted is then received or drawn into a  whirling canister  and is rolled by the centrifugal force in spiral lines within it being yet too tender for the spindle It is then passed between  two pairs of rollers  the second pair moving faster than the first elongate the thread with greater equality than can be done by the hand and is then twisted on spoles or bobbins  The great fertility of the Cottonplant in these fine flexile threads whilst these from Flax Hemp and Nettles or from the bark of the Mulberrytree require a previous putrefection of the parenchymatous substance and much mechanical labour and afterwards bleaching renders this plant of great importance to the world And since Sir Richard Arkwright's ingenious machine has not only greatly abbreviated and simplesied the labour and art of carding and spinning the Cottonwool but performs both these circumstances  better  than can be done by hand it is probable that the clothing of this snall seed will become the principal clothing of mankind though animal wool and silk may be preferable in colder climates as they are more imperfect conductors of heat and are thence a warmer clothing  And warms with rosy smiles the watery God  His ponderous oars to slender spindles turns  And pours o'er massy wheels his foamy urns  With playful charms her hoary lover wins  And wields his tridentwhile the Monarch spins  First with nice eye emerging Naiads cull  From leathery pods the vegetable wool  With wiry teeth  revolving cards  releas  The tanged knots and smooth the ravell'd fleece  Next moves the  ironhand  with fingers fine  Combs the wide card and forms the eternal line  Slow with soft lips the  whirling Can  acquires  The tender skeins and wraps in rising spires  With quicken'd pace  successive rollers  move  And these retain and those extend the  rove  Then fly the spoles the rapid axles glow  And slowly circumvolves the labouring wheel below  PAPYRA throned upon the banks of Nile  Cyperus Papyrus l  Three males one female The leaf of this plant was first used for paper whence the word  paper  and leaf or folium for a fold of a book Afterwards the bark of a species of mulberry was used whence  liber  signifies a book and the bark of a tree Before the invention of letters mankind may be said to have been perpatually in their infancy as the arts of one age or country generally died with their inventors Whence arose the policy which still continues in Indostan of obliging the son to practise the profession of his father After the discovery of letters the facts of Astronomy and Chemistry became recorded in written language though the antient hieroglyphic characters for the planets and metals continue in use at this day The antiquity of the invention of music of astronomical observations and the manufacture of Gold and Iron are recorded in Scripture  About twenty letters ten cyphers and seven crotches represent by their numerous combinations all our ideas and sensations the musical characters are probably arrived at their perfection unless emphasis and tone and swell could be exprssed as well as note and time Charles the Twelfth of Sweden had a design to have introduced a numeration by squares instead of by decimation which might have served the purposes of philosphy better than the present mode which is said to be of Arabic invention The alphabet is yet in a very imperfect state perhaps seventeen letters could express all the simple sounds in the European languages In China they have not yet learned to divide their words into syllables and are thence necssitated to employ many thousand characters it is said above eighty thousand It is to be wished in this ingenious age that the European nations would accord to reform our alphabet  Spread

parts of their flowers fructification c according with the classfication of Linneus in what she terms papermosaic She began this work at the age of when her sight would no longer serve her to paint in which she much excelled between her age of and at which time her eyes quite failed her she executed the curious Hortus siccus abovementioned which suppose contains a greater number of plants than were ever before drawn from the life by any one person Her method consisted in placing the leaves of each plant with the petals and all the other parts of the flowers on coloured paper and cutting them with scissars accurately to the natural size and form and then pasting them on a dark ground the effect of which is wonderful and their accuracy less liable to sallacy than drawings She is at this time in her th year with all the powers of a fine understanding still unimpaired I am informed another very ingenious lady Mrs North is constructing a similar Hortus siccus or Papergarden which she executes on a ground of vellum with such elegant taste and scientific accuracy that it cannot fail to become a work of inestimable value  Her paper soliage and her silken flowers  Her virgin train the

flowers close and open their petals at certain hours of the day and thus constitute what Linneus calls the Horologe or Watch of Flora He enumerates flowers which possess this kind of sensibility I shall mention a few of them with their respective hours of rising and setting as Linneus terms them He divides them first into  meteoric  flowers which less accurately observe the hour of unfolding but are expanded sooner or later according to the cloudiness moisture or pressure of the atmosphere d  Tropical  flowers open in the morning and close before evening every day but the hour of the expanding becomes earlier or later as the length of the day increases or decreases dly  Aequinoctial  flowers which open at a certain and exact hour of the day and for the most part close at another determinate hour  Hence the Horologe or Watch of Flora is formed from numerous plants of which the following are those most common in this country Leontodon taraxacum Dandelion opens at closes at

corol when the nectaries fall off seems to shew that the white juices of the corol were before carried to the nectaries for the purpose of producing honey because when these nectaries fall off no more of the white juice is secreted in the corol but it becomes green and degenerates into a calyx See note on Lonicera The nectary of the Tropaeolum garden nasturtien is a coloured horn grewing from the

truly astonishing In the ascites accompanied with anasarca of people past the meridian of life it will also sometimes succeed The method of administering it requires some caution as it is liable in greater doses to induce very violent and debilitating sickness which continues one or two days during which time the dropsical collection however disappears One large spoonful or half an ounce of the following decoction given twice a day will generally succeed in a few days But in more robust people one large spoonful every two hours till four spoonfuls are taken or till sickness occurs will evacuate the dropsical swellings with greater certainty but is liable to operate more violently Boil four ounces of the fresh leaves of purple Foxglove which leaves may be had at all seasons of the

bulls with brazen feet and the firebreathing dragons which guarded the Hesperian fruit yet are they not disgusting nor mischievous and in the manner you have chained them together in your exhibition they succeed each other amusingly enough like prints of the London Cries wrapped upon rollers with a glass before them In this at least they resemble the monsters in Ovid's Metamorphoses but your similies I suppose are Homeric  Poet  The great Bard well understood how to make use of this kind of ornament in Epic Poetry He brings his valiant heroes into the field with much parade and sets them a fighting with great fury and then after a few thrusts and parries he introduces a long string of similies During this the battle is supposed to continue and thus the time necessary for the action is gained in our imaginations  and a degree of probability produced which contributes to the temporary deception or reverie of the reader  But the similies of Homer have another agreeable characteristic they do not quadrate or go upon all fours as it is called like the more formal similies of some modern writers any one resembling feature seems to be with him a sufficient excuse for the introduction of this kind of digression he then proceeds to deliver some agreeable poetry on this new subject and thus converts every simile into a kind of short episode  B  Then a simile should not very accurately resemble the subject  P  No it would then become a philosophical analogy it would be ratiocination instead of poetry it need only so far resemble the subject as poetry itself ought to resemble nature It should have so much sublimity beauty or novelty as to interest the reader and should be expressed in picturesque language so as to bring the scenery before his eye and should lastly bear so much verisimilitude as not to awaken him by the violence of improbability or incongruity  B  May not the reverie of the reader be dissipated or disturbed by disagreeable images being presented to his imagination as well as by improbable or incongruous ones  P  Certainly he will endeavour to rouse himself from a disagreeable reverie as from the nightmare And from this may be discovered the line of boundary between the Tragic and the Horrid which line however will veer a little this way or that according to the prevailing manners of the age or country and the peculiar associations of ideas or idiosyncracy of mind of individuals For instance if an artist should represent the death of an officer in battle by shewing a little blood on the bosom of his shirt as if a bullet had there penetrated the dying figure would affect the beholder with pity and if fortitude was at the same time expressed in his countenance admiration would be added to our pity On the contrary if the artist should chuse to represent his thigh as shot away by a cannon ball and should exhibit the bleeding flesh and shattered bone of the stump the picture would introduce into our minds ideas from a butcher's shop or a surgeon's operationroom and we should turn from it with disgust So if characters were brought upon the stage with their limbs disjointed by torturing instruments and the floor covered with clotted blood and scattered brains our theatric reverie would be destroyed by disgust and we should leave the playhouse with detestation  The Painters have been more guilty in this respect than the Poets the cruelty of Apollo in flaying Marcias alive is a favourite subject with the antient artists and the tortures of expiring martyrs have disgraced the modern ones It requires little genius to exhibit the muscles in convulsive action either by the pencil or the chiffel because the interstices are deep and the lines strongly defined but those tender gradations of muscular action which constitute the graceful attitudes of the body are difficult to conceive or to execute except by a master of nice discernment and cultivated taste  B  By what definition would you distinguish the Horrid from the Tragic  P  I suppose the latter consists of Distress attended with Pity which is said to be allied to Love the most agreeable of all our passions and the former in Distress accompanied with Disgust which is allied to Hate and is one of our most disagreeable sensations Hence when horrid scenes of cruelty are represented in pictures we wish to disbelieve their existence and voluntarily exert ourselves to escape from the deception whereas the bitter cup of true Tragedy is mingled with some sweet consolatory drops which endear our tears and we continue to contemplate the interesting delusion with a delight which it is not easy to explain  B  Has not this been explained by Lucretius where he describes a shipwreck and says the Spectators receive pleasure from feeling themselves safe on land and by Akenside in his beautiful poem on the Pleasures of Imagination who ascribes it to our finding objects for the due exertion of our passions  P  We must not confound our sensations at the contemplation of real misery with those which we experience at the scenical representations of tragedy The spectators of a shipwreck may be attracted by the dignity and novelty of the object and from these may be said to receive pleasure but not from the distress of the sufferers An ingenious writer who has criticised this dialogue in the English Review for August adds that one great source of our pleasure from scenical distress arises from our at the same time generally contemplating one of the noblest objects of nature that  of Virtue triumphant over every difficulty and oppression or supporting its votary under every suffering or where this does not occur that our minds are relieved by the justice of some signal punishment awaiting the delinquent But besides this at the exhibition of a good tragedy we are not only amused by the dignity and novelty and beauty of the objects before us but if any distressful circumstances occur too forcible for our sensibility we can voluntarily exert ourselves and recollect that the scenery is not real and thus not only the pain which we had received from the apparent distress is lessened but a new source of pleasure is opened to us similar to that which we frequently have felt on awaking from a distressful dream we are glad that it is not true We are at the same time unwilling to relinquish the pleasure which we receive from the other interesting circumstances of the drama and on that account quickly permit ourselves to relapse into the delusion and thus alternately believe and disbelieve almost every moment the existence of the objects represented before us  B  Have those two sovereigns of poetic land HOMER and SHAKESPEAR kept their works entirely free from the Horrid or even yourself in your third Canto  P  The descriptions of the mangled carcasses of the companions of Ulysses in the cave of Polypheme is in this respect certainly objectionable as is well observed by Scaliger And in the play of Titus Andronicus if that was written by Shakespear which from its internal evidence I think very improbable there are many horrid and disgustful circumstances The following Canto is submitted to the candour of the critical reader to whose opinion I shall submit in silence  THE LOVES OF THE PLANTS  CANTO III  AND now the Goddess sounds her silver shell  And shakes with deeper

the devil as its name imports It grows amid the mouldering bones and decayed coffins in the ruinous vaults of Sleafordchurch in Lincolnshire The superstitious ceremonies or hisories belonging to some vegetables have been truly ridiculous thus the Druids are said to have cropped the Misletoe with a golden axe or sickle and the Bryony or Mandrake was said to utter a scream when its root was drawn from the ground and that the animal which drew it up became diseased and soon died on which account when it was wanted for the purposes of medicine it was usual to loosen and remove the earth about the root and then to tie it by means of a cord to a dog's tail who was whipped to pull it up and was then supposed to suffer for the impiety of the action And even at this day bits of dried root of Peony are rubbed smooth and strung and sold under the name of Anodyne necklaces and tied round the necks of children to facilitate the growth of their teeth add to this that in Price's History of Cornwall a book published about ten years ago the Virga Divinatoria or Divining Rod has a degree of credit given to it This rod is of hazle or other light wood and held horizontally in the hand and is said to bow towards the ore whenver the Conjurer walks over a mine A very few years ago in France and even in England another kind of divining rod has been used to discover springs of water in a similar manner and gained some credit And in the very last year there were many in France and some in England who underwent an enchantment without any divining rod at all and believed themselves to be

presides not  l Sleep consists in the abolition of all voluntary power both over our muscular motions and our ideas for we neither walk nor reason in sleep But at the same time many of our muscular motions and many of our ideas continue to be excited into action in consequence of internal irritations and of internal sensations for the heart and arteries continue to beat and we experience variety of passions and even hunger and thirst in our dreams Hence I conclude that our nerves of sense are not torpid or inert during sleep but that they are only precluded from the perception of external objects by their external organs being rendered unfit to transmit to them the appu  es of external bodies during the suspension of the power of volition thus the eyelids are closed in sleep and I suppose the tympanum of the ear is not stretched because they are deprived of the voluntary exertions of the muscles appropriated to these purposes and it is probable something similar happens to the external apparatus of our other organs of sense which may render them unfit for their office of perception during sleep for milk put into the mouths of sleeping babes occasions them to swallow and suck and if the eyelid is a little opened in the daylight by the exertions of disturbed sleep the person dreams of being much dazzled See first Interlude  When there arises in sleep a painful desire to exert the voluntary motions it is called the Nightmare or Incubus When the sleep becomes so imperfect that some muscular motions obey this exertion of desire people have walked about and even

this country with the Swallows as they are called or basons on some of the mountains like volcanic Craters where the rainwater sinks into the earth and the numerous large stones which seem to have

channels of these subterianeous rivers seem to have been formed when a long tract of rocks were raised by the sea flowing in upon the central files and thus producing an irresi  able explosion of steam and when these rocks again subsided their parts did not exactly correspond but left a  ong cavity arched over in this operation of nature The cavities at Castleton and Buxton in Derbyshire seem

so delightful to our sense of smell as well as the disgreeable scents of others are owing to the exhalation of their essential oils These essential oils have greater or less volatility and are all inflammable many of them are poisons to us as these of Laurel and Tobacco others possess a narcotic quality as is evinced by the oil of cloves instantly relieving slight toothachs from oil of cinnamon

to protect them from the depredations of their voracious enemies One of the essential oils that of turpentine is recommended by M de Thoffe for the purpose of destroying insects which infect both vegetables and animals Having observed that the trees were attacked by multitudes of small insects of different colours pucins ou purrons which injured their young branches he destroyed them all intinaely in the following manner he put into a bowl a few handfuls of earth on which he poured a small quantity of oil of turpentine he then beat the whole together with a spatula p  uring on it water till it became of the consistence of soup with this mixture he moistened the ends of the branches and both the insects and their eggs were destroyed and other insects kept aloof by the scent of the turpentine He adds that he destroyed the fleas of his puppies by once bathing them in warm water impregnated with oil of turpentine Mem d'Agriculture An Trimest Printemp p I sprinkled some oil of turpentine by means of a brush on some branches of a nectarinetree which was covered with the aphis but it killed both the insect and the branches a solution of arsenic much diluted did the same The

general wholesome and agreeable food to graminivorous animals See note on Ilex The flowers or petals of plants are perhaps in general more acrid than their leaves hence they are much seldomer eaten by insects This seems to have been the use of the essential oil in the vegetable economy as observed above in the notes on Dictamnus and on Ilex The fragrance of plants is thus a part of their defence

and dying as the young one increases is not only analogous to other tuberous or knobby roots but also to some bulbous roots as the tulip The manner of the production of herbaceous plants from their various perennial roots seems to want further investigation as their analogy is not yet clearly established The caudex or true root in the orchis lies above the knob and from this part the fibrous roots and the new knob are produced In the tulip the caudex lies below the bulb from whence proceed the fibrous roots and the new bulbs and I suspect the tuliproot after it has flowered dies like the orchisroot for the stem of the last year's tulip lies on the outside and not in the center of the new bulb which I am informed does not happen in the three or four first years when raised from feed when it only produces a stem and slender leaves without flowering In the tuliproot dissected in the early spring just before it begins to shoot a perfect flower is seen in its center and between the first and second coat the large next year's bulb is I believe produced between the second and third coat and between this and the fourth coat and perhaps further other less and less bulls are visible all adjoining to the caudex at the bottom of the motherbulb and which I am told require as many years before they will flower as the number of the coats with which they are covered This annual reproduction of the tuliproot induces some florists to believe that tuliproots never die naturally as they lose so few of them whereas the hyacinthroots I am informed will not last above five or seven years after they have flowered  The hyacinthroot differs from the tuliproot as the stem of the last year's flower is always found in the center of the root and the new offsets arise from the caudex below the bulb but not beneath any of the concentric coats of the root except the external one hence Mr Eaton an ingenious florist of Derby to whom I am indebted for most of the observations in this note concludes that the hyacinthroot does not perish annually after it has flowered like the tulip Mr Eaton gave me a tulip root which had been set too deep in the earth and the caudex had elongated itself near an inch and the new bulb was formed above the old one and detached from it instead of adhering to its side  The caudex of the ranunculus cultivated by the florists lies above the clawlike root in this the old root or claws die annually like the tulip and orchis and the new claws which are seen above the old ones draw down the caudex lower into the earth The same is said to happen to Scabiosa or Devil's bit and some other plants as valerian and greater plantain the new fibrous roots rising round the caudex above the old ones the inferior end of the root becomes stumped as if cut off after the old fibrous are decayed and the caudex is drawn down into the earth by these new roots See Arum and Tulipa  And lulls her infant in her fondling arms  Soft plays  Affection  round her

philosophers have believed that the continent of America was not raised out of the great ocean at so early a period of time as the other continents One reason for this opinion was because the great lakes perhaps nearly as large as the Mediterranean Sea consist of fresh water And as the seasalt seems to have its origin from the destruction of vegetable and animal bodies washed down by rains and carried by rivers into lakes or seas it would seem that this source of seasalt had not so long existed in that country There is however a more satisfactory way of explaining this circumstance which is that the American lakes lie above the level of the ocean and are hence perpetually desalited by the rivers which run through them which is not the case with the Mediterranean into which a current from the main ocean perpetually passes  And feeds the trackless forests on his sides  Fair CASSIA trembling hears the howling woods  Cassia  l Ten males one female The seeds are black the stamens

emigrant seeds The fact is truly wonderful and cannot be accounted for but by the existence of under currents in the depths of the ocean or from vortexes of water passing from one country to another through caverns of the earth  Sir Hans Sloane has given an account of four kinds of seeds which are frequently thrown by the sea upon the coasts of the islands of the northern parts of Scotland Phil Trans abridged Vol III p which seeds are natives of the West Indies and seem to be brought thither by the gulfstream deserbed below One of these is called by Sir H Sloane Phaseolus maximus perennis which is often also thrown on the coast of Kerry in Ireland another is called in Jamaica Horseeyebean and a third is called Niker in Jamaica He adds that the Lenticula marina or Sargosso grows on the rocks about Jamaica is carried by the winds and current towards the coast of Florida and thence into the NorthAmerican ocean where it lies very thick on the surface of the sea  Thus a rapid current passes from the gulf of Florida to the N E along the coast of NorthAmerica known to seamen by the name of the GULFSTREAM A chart of this was published by Dr Francklin in from the information principally of Capt Folger This was confirmed by the ingenious experiments of Dr Blagden published in who found that the water of the Gulfstream was from six to eleven degrees warmer than the water of the sea through which it ran which must have been occasioned by its being brought from a hotter climate He ascribes the origin of this current to the power of the tradewinds which blowing always in the same direction carry the waters of the Atlantic ocean to the westward till they are stopped by the opposing continent on the west of the Gulf of Mexico and are thus accumulated there and run down the Gulf of Florida Philos Trans V p Governor Pownal has given an elegant map of this Gulfstream tracing it from the Gulf of Florida northward as sar as Cape Sable in Nova Scotia and then across the Atlantic ocean to the coast of Africa between the Canaryislands and Senegal increasing in breadth▪ as it runs till it occupies five or six degrees of latitude The Governer likewise ascribes this current to the force of the tradewinds  protruding  the waters westward till they are opposed by the continent and accumulated in the Gulf of Mexico He very ingeniously observes that a great eddy must be produced in the Atlantic ocean between this Gulfstream and the westerly current protruded by the tropical winds and in this eddy are found the immense fields of floating vegetables called Saragosa weeds and Gulfweeds and some light woods which circulate in these vast eddies or are occasionally driven out of them by the winds Hydraulic and Nautical Observations by Governor Pownal Other currents are mentioned by the Governor in this ingeniou work as those in the Indian Sea northward of the line which are ascribed to the influence of the Monsoons It is probable that in process of time the narrow tract of land on the west of the Gulf of Mexico may be worn away by this elevation of water dashing against it by which this immense current would cease to exist and a wonderful change take place in the Gulf of Mexico and West Indian islands by the subsiding of the sea which might probably lay all those islands into one or join them to the continent  And trusts her tawny children to the

are the particulars of their relationship  Poet  It has been already observed that the principal part of the language of poetry consists of those words which are expressive of the ideas which we originally receive by the organ of sight and in this it nearly indeed resembles painting which can express itself in no other way but by exciting the ideas or sensations belonging to the sense of vision But besides this essential similitude in the language of the poetic pen and pencil these two sisters resemble each other if I may so say in many of their habits and manners The painter to produce a strong effect makes a few parts of his picture large distinct and luminous and keeps the remainder in shadow or even beneath its natural size and colour to give eminence to the principal figure This is similar to the common  manner of poetic composition where the subordinate characters are kept down to elevate and give consequence to the hero or heroine of the piece  In the south aile of the cathedral church at Lichfield there is an antient monument of a recumbent figure the head and neck of which lie on a roll of matting in a kind of niche or cavern in the wall and about five feet distant horizontally in another opening or cavern in the wall are seen the feet and ankles with some folds of garment lying also on a matt and though the intermediate space is a solid stonewall yet the imagination supplies the deficiency and the whole figure seems to exist before our eyes Does not this resemble one of the arts both of the painter and the poet The former often shows a mulcular arm amidst a group of figures or an impassioned face and hiding the remainder of the body behind other objects leaves the imagination to compleat it The latter describing a single feature or attitude in picturesque words produces before the mind an image of the whole  I remember seeing a print in which was represented a shrivelled hand stretched through an iron grate in the stone floor of a prisonyard to reach at a mess of porrage which affected me with more horrid ideas of the distress of the prisoner in the dungeon below than could have been perhaps produced by an exhibition of the whole person And in the following beautiful scenery from the Midsummernight's dream in which I have taken the liberty to alter the place of a comma the description of the swimming step and prominent belly bring the whole figure before our eyes with the distinctness of reality  When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive  And grow bigbellied with the wanton wind  Which she with pretty and with swimming gate  Following her womb then rich with my young squire  Would imitate and sail upon the land  There is a third sisterfeature which belongs both to the pictorial and poetic art and that is the making sentiments and passions visible as it were to the spectator this is done in both arts by describing or portraying the effects or changes which those sentiments or passions produce upon the body At the end of the unaltered play of Lear there is a beautiful example of poetic painting the old King is introduced as dying from grief for the loss of Cordelia at this crisis Shakespear conceiving the robe of the king to be held together by a clasp represents him as only saying to an attendant courtier in a faint voice "Pray Sir undo this buttonthank you Sir" and dies Thus by the art of the poet the oppression at the bosom of the dying King is made visible not described in words  B  What are the features in which these Sisterarts do not resemble each other  P  The ingenious Bishop Berkeley in his Treatise on Vision a work of great ability has evinced that the colours which we see are only a language suggesting to our minds the ideas of solidity and extension which we had before received by the sense of touch Thus when we view the trunk of a tree our eye can only acquaint us with the colours or shades and from the previous experience of the sense of touch these suggest to us the cylindrical form with the prominent or depressed wrinkles on it From hence it appears that  there is the strictest analogy between colours and sounds as they are both but languages which do not represent their correspondent ideas but only suggest them to the mind from the habits or associations of previous experience It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the more artificial arrangements of these two languages by the poet and the painter bear a similar analogy  But in one circumstance the Pen and the Pencil differ widely from each other and that is the quantity of Time which they can include in their respective representations The former can unravel a long series of events which may constitute the history of days or years while the latter can exhibit only the actions of a moment The Poet is happier in describing successive scenes the Painter in representing stationary ones both have their advantages  Where the passions are introduced as the Poet on one hand has the power gradually to prepare the mind of his reader by previous climacteric circumstances the Painter on the other hand can throw stronger illumination and distinctness on the principal moment or catastrophe of the action besides the advantage he has in using an universal language which can be  read  in an instant of time Thus where a great number of figures are all seen together supporting or contrasting each other and contributing to explain or aggrandize the principal effect we view a picture with agreeable surprize and contemplate it with unceasing admiration In the representation of the sacrifice of Jephtha's Daughter a print done from a painting of Ant Coypel at one glance of the eye we read all the interesting passages of the last act of a wellwritten tragedy so much poetry is there condensed into a moment of time  B  Will you now oblige me with an account of the relationship between Poetry and her other sister Music  P  In the poetry of our language I don't think we are to look for any thing analogous to the notes of the gamut for except perhaps in a few exclamations or interrogations we are at liberty to raise or sink our voice an octave or two at pleasure without altering the sense of the words Hence if either poetry or prose be read in melodious tones of voice as is done in recitativo or in chaunting it must depend on the speaker not on the writer for though words may be selected which are less harsh than others that is which have fewer sudden stops or abrupt consonants amongst the vowels or with fewer sibilant letters yet this does not constitute melody which consists of agreeable successions of notes referrable to the gamut or harmony which consists of agreeable combinations of them If the Chinese language has many words of similar articulation which yet signify different ideas when spoken in a higher or lower musical note as some travellers affirm it must be capable of much finer effect in respect to the audible part of poetry than any language we are acquainted with  There is however another affinity in which poetry and music more nearly resemble each other than has generally been understood and that is in their measure or time There are but two kinds of time acknowledged in modern music which are called  triple time  and  common time  The former of these is divided by bars each bar containing three crotchets or a proportional number of their subdivisions into quavers and semiquavers This kind of time is analogous to the measure of our heroic or iambic verse Thus the two following couplets are each of them divided into five bars of  triple time  each bar consisting of two crotchets and two quavers nor can they be divided into bars analogous to  common time  without the bars interfering with some of the crotchets so as to divide them  Softwarbling beaks in each bright blos som move  And vo cal rosebuds thrill the inchanted grove  In these lines there is a quaver and a crochet alternately in every bar except in the last in which  the in  make two semiquavers the  e  is supposed by Grammarians to be cut off which any one's ear will readily determine not to be true  Life buds or breathes from Indus to the poles  And the vast surface kind les as it rolls  In these lines there is a quaver and a crotchet alternately in the sirst bar a quaver two crotchets and a quaver make the second bar In the third bar there is a quaver a crotchet and a rest after the crotchet that is after the word  poles  and two quavers begin the next line The fourth bar consists of quavers and crotchets alternately In the last bar there is a quaver and a rest after it viz after the word  kindles  and then two quavers and a crotchet You will clearly perceive the truth of this if you prick the musical characters above mentioned under the verses  The  common time  of musicians is divided into bars each of which contains four crotchets or a proportional number of their subdivision into quavers and semiquavers This kind of musical time is analogous to the dactyle verses of our language the most popular instances of which are in Mr Anstie's BathGuide In this kind of verse the bar does not begin till after the first or second syllable and where the verse is quite complete and written by a good ear these first syllables added to the last complete the bar exactly in this also corresponding with many pieces of music  Yet if one may guess by the size of his calf Sir  He weighs about twentythree stone and a half Sir  Master Mamozet's head was not finished so soon  For it took up the barber a whole afternoon  In these lines each bar consists of a crotchet two quavers another crotchet and two more quavers which are equal to four crotchets and like many bars of  common time  in music may be subdivided into two in beating time without disturbing the measure  The following verses from Shenstone belong likewise to common time  A river or a sea  Was to him a dish of tea  And a king dom bread and butter  The first and second bars consist each of a crotchet a quaver a crotchet a quaver a crotchet The third bar consists of a quaver two crotchets a quaver a crotchet The last bar is not complete without adding the letter A which begins the first line and then it consists of a quaver a crotchet a quaver a crotchet two quavers  It must be observed that the crotchets in triple time are in general played by musicians slower than those of common time and hence minuets are generally pricked in triple time and country dances generally in common time So the verses above related which are analogous to  triple time  are generally read slower than those analogous to  common time  and are thence generally used for graver compositions I suppose all the different kinds of verses to be found in our odes which have any measure at all might be arranged  one or other of these two musical times allowing a note or  sometimes to precede the commencement of the bar and occasional rests as in musical compositions if this was attended to by those who set poetry to music it is probable the sound and sense would oftener coincide Whether these musical times can be applied to the lyric and heroic verses of the Greek and Latin poets I do not pretend to determine certain it is that the dactyle verse of our language when it is ended with a double rhime much resembles the measure of Homer and Virgil except in the length of the lines  B  Then there is no relationship between the other two of these sisterladies Painting and Music  P  There is at least a mathematical relationship or perhaps I ought rather to have said a metaphysical relationship between them Sir Isaac Newton has observed that the breadths of the seven primary colours in the Sun's image refracted by a prism are proportional to the seven musical notes of the gamut or to the intervals of the eight sounds contained in an octave that is proportional to the following numbers  Sol  La  Fa  Sol  La  Mi  Fa  Sol  Red  Orange  Yellow  Green  Blue  Indigo  Violet                      Newton's Optics Book I part prop and Dr Smith in his Harmonics has an explanatory note upon this happy discovery as he terms it of Newton Sect Art  From this curious coincidence it has been proposed to produce a luminous music consisting of successions or combinations of colours analogous to a tune in respect to the proportions above mentioned This might be performed by a strong light made by means of Mr Argand's lamps passing through coloured glasses and falling on a defined part of a wall with moveable blinds before them which might communicate with the keys of a harpsichord and thus produce at the same time visible and audible music in unison with each other  The execution of this idea is said by Mr Guyot to have been attempted by Father Caffel without much success  If this should be again attempted there is another curious coincidence between sounds and colours discovered by Dr Darwin of Shrewsbury and explained in a paper on what he calls  Ocular Spectra  in the Philosophical Transactions Vol LXXVI which might much facilitate the execution of it In this treatise the Doctor has demonstrated that we see certain colours not only with greater ease and distinctness but with relief and pleasure after having for some time contemplated other certain colours as green after red or red after green orange after blue or blue after orange yellow after violet or violet after yellow This he shews arises from the  ocular spectrum  of the colour last viewed coinciding with the  irritation  of the colour now under contemplation Now as the pleasure we receive from the sensation of melodious notes independent of the previous associations of agreeable ideas with them must arise from our hearing some proportions of sounds after others more easily distinctly or agreeably and as there is a coincidence between the proportions of the primary colours and the primary sounds if they may be so called he argues that the same laws must govern the sensations of both In this circumstance therefore consists the sisterhood of Music and Painting and hence they claim a right to borrow metaphors from each other musicians to speak of the brilliancy of sounds and the light and shade of a concerto and painters of the harmony of colours and the tone of a picture Thus it was not quite so absurd as was imagined when the blind man asked if the colour scarlet was like the sound of a trumpet As the coincidence or opposition of these  ocular spectra  or colours which remain in the eye after having for some time contemplated a luminous object are more easily and more accurately ascertained now their laws have been investigated by Dr Darwin than the  relicts  of evanescent sounds upon the ear it is to be wished that some ingenious musician would further cultivate this curious field of science for if visible music can be agreeably produced it would be more easy to add sentiment to it by the representations of groves and Cupids and sleeping  nymphs amid the changing colours than is commonly done by the words of audible music  B  You mentioned the greater length of the verses of Homer and Virgil Had not these poets great advantage in the superiority of their languages compared to our own  P  It is probable that the introduction of philosophy into a country must gradually affect the language of it as philosophy converses in more appropriated and abstracted terms and thus by degrees eradicates the abundance of metaphor which is used in the more early ages of society Otherwise though the Greek compound words have more vowels in proportion to their consonants than the English ones yet the modes of compounding them are less general as may be seen by variety of instances given in the preface of the Translators prefixed to the SYSTEM OF VEGETABLES by the Lichfield Society which happy property of our own language rendered that translation of Linneus as expressive and as concise perhaps more so than the original  And in one respect I believe the Engish language serves the purpose of poetry better than the antient ones I mean in the greater ease of producing personifications for as our nouns have in general no genders affixed to them in prosecompositions and in the habits of conversation they become easily personified only by the addition of a masculine or feminine pronoun as  Pale Melancholy sits and round  her  throws  A deathlike silence and a dread repose  Pope's Abelard  And secondly as most of our nouns have the article  a  or  the  prefixed to them in prosewriting and in conversation they in general become personisied even by the omission of these articles as in the bold figure of Shipwreck in Miss Seward's Elegy on Capt Cook  But round the steepy rocks and dangerous strand  Rolls the white surf and SHIPWRECK guards the land  Add to this that if the verses in our heroic poetry be shorter than those of the ancients our words likewise are shorter and in respect to their measure or time which has erroneously been called melody and harmony I doubt from what has been said above whether we are so much inferior as is generally believedsince many passages which have been stolen from antient poets have been translated into our language without losing any thing of the beauty of the versification  B  I am glad to hear you acknowledge the thefts of the modern poets from the antient ones whose works I suppose have been reckoned lawful plunder in all ages But have not you borrowed epithets phrases and even half a line occasionally from modern poems  P  It may be difficult to mark the exact boundary of what should be termed plagiarism where the sentiment and expression are both borrowed without due acknowledgement there can be no doubt single words on the contrary taken from other authors cannot convict a writer of plagiarism they are lawful game wild by nature the property of all who can capture themand perhaps a few common flowers of speech may be gathered as we pass over our  neighbour's inclosure without stigmatizing us with the title of thieves but we must not therefore plunder his cultivated fruit  The four lines at the end of the plant Upas are imitated from Dr Young's Night Thoughts The line in the episode adjoined to Cassia "The salt tear mingling with the milk he sips" is from an interesting and humane

petals of a pure white it begins to open about seven or eight o'clock in the evening and clsoses before sunrise in the morning Martyn's Letters p The Cistus labdiniferus and many other flowers lose their petals after having been a few hours expanded in the daytime for in these plants the stigma is soon impregnated by the numerous anthers in many flowers of the Cistus lubdiniferus I observed two or three of the stamens were perpetually bent into contact with the pistil  The Nyctanthes called Arabian Jasmine is another flower which expands a beautiful corol and gives out a most delicate perfume during the night and not in the day in its native country whence its name botanical philosophers have not yet explained this wonderful property perhaps the plant sleeps during the day as some animals do and its odoriferous glands only emit their fragrance during the expansion of the petals that is during its waking hours the Geranium trisle has the same property of giving up its fragrance only in the night The flowers of the Cucurbita lagenaria are said to close when the sun shines upon them In our climate many flowers as tragopogon and hibiscus close their flowers before the hottest

twilight in the evening but not after total darkness came on these singular scintillations were shewn to her father and other philosophers and Mr Wilcke a celebrated electrician believed them to be electric Lin Spec Plantar p Swedish Acts for the year Pulteney's View of Linncus p Nor is this more wonderful than that the electric eel and torpedo should give voluntary shocks of electricity and in this plant perhaps as in those animals it may be a mode of defence by which it harrasses or destroys the nightflying insects which infest it and probably it may emit the same sparks during the day which must be then invisible This curious subject deserves further investigation See Dictamnus The ceasing to shine of this plant after twilight might induce one to conceive that it absorbed and emitted light like the Bolognian Phosphorus or calcined oystershells so well explained by Mr B Wilson and by T B Beccari Exper on Phosphori by B Wilson Dodsley The light of the evening at the same distance from noon is much greater as I have repeatedly observed than the light of the morning this is owing I suppose to the phosphorescent quality of almost all bodies in a greater or less degree which thus absorb light during the sunshine and continue to emit it again for some time afterwards though not in such quantity as to produce apparent scintillations The nectary of this plant grows from what is supposed to be the calyx but this supposed calyx is coloured and perhaps from this circumstance of its bearing the nectary should rather be esteemed a part of the coral See an additional

arguments which tend to shew that the warm springs of this country are produced from steam raised by deep subterraneous fires and afterwards condensed between the strata of the mountains appear to me much more conclusive than the idea of their being warmed by chemical combinations near the surface of the earth for st their heat has kept accurately the same perhaps for many centuries certainly as long as we have been possessed of good thermometers which cannot be well explained without supposing that they are first in a boiling state For as the heat of boiling water is and that of the internal parts of the earth it is easy to understand that the steam raised from boiling water after being condensed in some mountain and passing from thence through a certain space of the cold earth must be cooled always to a given degree and it is probable the distance from the exit of the spring to the place where the steam is condensed might be guessed by the degree of its warmth  In the dry summer of when all other springs were either dry or much diminished those of Buxton and Matlock as I was well informed on the spot had suffered no diminution which proves that the sources of these warm springs are at great depths below the surface of the earth  There are numerous perpendicular fissures in the rocks of Derbyshire in which the ores of lead and copper are found and which pass to unknown depths and might thence afford a passage to steam from great subterraneous fires  If these waters were heated by the decomposition of pyrites there would be some chalybeate taste or sulphureous smell in them

species of Fucus or of Conserva soon appears in all basons which contain water Dr Priestley found that great quantities of pure dephlogisticated air were given up in water at the points of this vegetable particularly in the sunshine and that hence it contributed to preserve the water in reservoirs from becoming putrid The minute divisions of the leaves of subaquatic plants as mentioned in the note on Trapa and of the gills of fish seem to serve another purpose besides that of increasing their surface which has not I believe been attended to and that is to facilitate the separation of the air which is mechanically mixed or chemically dissolved in water by their points or edges this appears on immersing a dry hairy leaf in water fresh from a pump innumerable globules like quicksilver appear on almost every point for the extremities of these points attract the particles of water less forcibly than those particles attract each other hence the contained air whose elasticity was but just balanced by the attractive power of the surrounding particles of water to each other finds at the point of each fibre a place where the resistance to its expansion is less and in consequence it there expands and becomes a bubble of air It is easy to foresee that the rays of the sunshine by being refracted and in part reflected by the two surfaces of these minute airbubbles must impart to them much more heat than to the transparent water and thus facilitate their ascent by further expanding them that the points of vegetables attract the particles of water less than they attract each other is seen by the spherical form of dewdrops on the points of grass See note on Vegetable Respiration in Part I  To amorous Echo sings his  secret  loves  Bathes his fair forehead in

Salubrious powers enrich the troubled waves  Amphibious Nymph from Nile's prolific bed  Emerging TRAPA lifts her pearly head  Trapa  l Four males one female The lower leaves of this plant grow under water and are divided into minute capillary ramifications while the upper leaves are broad and round and have airbladders in their footstalks to support them above the surface of the water As the aërial leaves of vegetables do the office of lungs by exposing a large surface of vessels with their contained fluids to the influence of the air so these aquatic leaves answer a similar purpose like the gills of fish and perhaps gain from water or give to it a similar material As the material thus necessary to life seems to abound more in air than in water the subaquatic leaves of this plant and of sisymbrium coenanthe ranunculus aquatilis water crowfoot and some others are cut into fine divisions to increase the surface whilst those above water are undivided So the plants on high mountains have their upper leaves more divided as pimpinella petroselinum and others because here the air is thinner and thence a larger surface of contact is required The stream of water also passes but once along the gills of fish as it is sooner deprived of its virtue whereas the air is both received and ejected by the action of the lungs of landanimals The whale seems to be an exception to the above as he receives water and spouts it out again from an organ which I suppose to be a respiratory one As springwater is nearly of the same degree of heat in all climates the aquatic plants which grow in rills or fountains are found equally in the torrid temperate and frigid zones as watercress waterparsnip ranunculus and many others  In warmer climates the watery grounds are usefully cultivated as with rice and the roots of some aquatic plants are said to have supplied food as the antient Lotus in Egypt which some have supposed to be the NymphaeaIn Siberia the roots of the Butomus or flowering rush are eaten which is well worth further enquiry as they grow spontaneously in our ditches and rivers which at present produce no esculent vegetables and might thence become an article of useful cultivation Herodotus affirms that the Egyptian Lotos grows in the Nile and resembles a Lily That the natives dry it in the sun and take the pulp out of it which grows like the head of a poppy and

Molina in his History of Chili translated from the Italian by the Abbè Grewvel mentions a species of Basil which he calls Ocymum salinum he says it resembles the common basil except that the stalk is round and jointed and that though it grows miles from the sea yet every morning it is covered with saline globules which are hard and splendid appearing at a distance like dew and that each plant furnishes about half an ounce of fine salt every day which the peasants collect and use as common salt but esteem it superior in flavour  As an article of diet salt seems to act simply as a stimulus not containing any nourishment and is the only fossil substance which the caprice of mankind has yet taken into their stomachs along with their food and like all other unnatural stimuli is not necessary to people in health and contributes to weaken our system though it may be useful as a medicine It seems to be the immediate cause of the sea scurvy as those patients quickly recover by the use of fresh provisions and is probably a remote cause of scrophula which consists in the want of irritability in the absorbent vessels and is therefore serviceable to these patients as wine is necessary to those whose stomachs have been weakened by its use The universality of the use of salt with our food and in our cookery has rendered it difficult to prove the truth of these observations I suspect that fleshmeat cut into thin slices either raw or boiled might be preserved in coarse sugar or treacle and thus a very nourishing and salutary diet might be presented to our seamen See note on Saltrocks in Vol I Canto II If a person unaccustomed to much salt should eat a couple of redherrings his insensible perspiration will be so much increased by the stimulus of the salt that he will find it necessary in about two hours to drink a quart of water the effects of a continued use of salt in weakening the action of the lymphatic system may hence be deduced  Calls her light car and

black or scarlet blotches on them As the plant has no corol or blossom it is probable the coloured juices in these parts of the sheath or leaves may serve the same purpose as the coloured juices in

petals of the tulip become striped with many colours the plant loses almost half of its height and the method of making them thus break into colours is by transplanting them into a meagre or sandy

Africa to the Atlantic ocean sometimes for a few hours sometimes for several days without regular periods It is always attended with a fog or haze so dense as to render those objects invisible which are at the distance of a quarter of a mile the sun appears through it only about noon and then of a dilute red and very minute particles subside from the misty air so as to make the grass and the skins of negroes appear whitish The extreme dryness which attends this wind or fog without dews withers and quite dries the leaves of vegetables and is said of Dr Lind at some seasons to be fatal and malignant to mankind probably after much preceding wet when it may become loaded with the exhalations from putrid marshes at other seasons it is said to check epidemic diseases to cure fluxes and to heal ulcers and cutaneous eruptions which is probably effected by its yielding no moisture to the mouths of the external absorbent vessels by which the action of the other branches of the absorbent system is increased to supply the deficiency  Account of the Harmattan Phil Transact V LXXl  The Rev Mr Sterling gives an account of a darkness for six or eight hours at Detroit in America on the th

covered most parts of Europe for many weeks in the summer of which has been supposed to have had a volcanic origin as it succeeded the violent eruption of Mount Heela and its neighbourhood From the subsidence of a white powder it seems probable that the Harmattan has a similar origin from the unexplored mountains of Africa Nor is it improbable that the epidemic coughs which occasionally traverse immense tracts of country may be the products of volcanic eruptions nor impossible that at some future time contagious miasmata may be thus emitted from subterraneous furnaces in such abundance as to

during the November of the dry monsoons or S E winds continued so much longer than usual that the large rivers became dry and prodigious quantities of seafish dead and dying were seen floating for

dust on its wings Cynips Psenes Syst Nat and penetrating the female fig thus impregnated the flowers for the evidence of this wonderful fact see the word Caprification in Milne's Botanical Dictionary The figs of this country are all female and their seeds not prolific and therefore they can only be propagated by layers and suckers  Monsieur de la Hire has shewn in the Memoir de l'Academ de Science that the summer figs of Paris in Provence Italy and Malta have all perfect stamina and ripen not only their fruits but their seed from which seed other figtrees are raised but that the stamina of the autumnal figs are abortive perhaps owing to the want of due warmth Mr Milne in his Botanical Dictionary art Caprification says that the cultivated figtrees have a few male flowers placed above the female within the same covering or receptacle which in warmer climates perform their proper office but in colder ones become abortive And Linneus observes that some figs have the navel of the receptacle open which was one reason that induced him to remove this plant from the class Clandestine Marriage to the class Polygamy Lin Spec Plant  From all these circumstances I should conjecture that those female figflowers which are closed on all sides in the fruit or receptacle without any male ones are monsters which have been propagated for their fruit like barberries and grapes without seeds in them and that the Caprification is either an antient process of imaginary use and blindly followed in some countries or that it may contribute to ripen the fig by decreasing its vigour like cutting off a circle of the bark from the branch of a peartree Tournefort seems inclined to this opinion who says that the figs in Provence and at Paris ripen sooner if their buds be pricked with a straw dipped in oliveoil Plumbs and pears punctured by some insects ripen sooner and the part round the puncture is sweeter Is not the honeydew produced by the puncture of insects will not wounding the branch of a peartree which is too vigorous prevent the blossoms from falling off as from some figtrees the fruit is said to fall off unless they are wounded by caprification I had last spring six

flowers Every tree indeed ought to be considered as a family or swarm of its respective buds but the buds themselves seem to be individual plants because each has leaves or lungs appropriated to it and the bark of the tree is only a congeries of the roots of all these individual buds Thus hollow oaktrees and willows are often seen with the whole wood decayed and gone and yet the few remaining

itself up crossing the thorns over the opposite edge of the leaf like the teeth of a spring raptrap of this plant I was savoured with an elegant coloured drawing by Miss Maria Jackson of Tarporly in Cheshire a Lady who adds much botanical knowledge to many other elegant acquirements  In the Apocynum Androsaemifolium one kind of Dog's bane the anthers converge over the nectaries which consist of five glandular oval corpuscles surrounding the germ and at the same time admit air to the nectaries at the interstice between each anther But when a fly inserts its proboscis between these anthers to plunder the honey they converge closer and with such violence as to detain the fly which thus generally perishes This account was related to me by R W Darwin  Esq  of Elston in Nottinghamshire who showed me the plant in flower July d with a fly thus held fast by the end of its proboscis and was well seen by a magnifying lens and which in vain repeatedly struggled to disengage itself till the converging anthers were separated by means of a pin on some days he had observed that almost every flower of this elegant plant had a fly in it thus entangled and a few weeks afterwards favoured me with his further observations on this subject  My Apocynum is not yet out of flower I have often visited it and have frequently found four or five flies some alive and some dead in its flowers they are generally caught by the trunk or proboscis sometimes by the trunk and a leg there is one at present only caught by a leg I don't know that this plant sleeps as the flowers remain open in the night yet the flies frequently make their escape In a plant of Mr Ordino's an ingenious gardener at Newark who is possessed of a great collection of plants I saw many flowers of an Apocynum with three dead

efficient cause which renders the hollies prickly in Needwood Forest only as high as the animals can reach them may arise from the lower branches being constantly cropped by them and thus shoot forth

wers by M Haggren Lecturer in Natural History One evening he perceived a faint flash of light repeatedly dart from a Marigold surprized at such an uncommon appearance he resolved to examine it with attention and to be assured that it was no deception of the eye he placed a man near him with orders to make a signal at the moment when he observed the light They both saw it constantly at the same moment  The light was most brilliant on Marigolds of an orange or flame colour but scarcely visible on pale ones  The flash was frequently seen on the same flower two or three times in quick succession but more commonly at intervals of several minutes and when several slowers in the same place emitted their light together it could be observed at a considerable distance  This phaenomenon was remarked in the months of July and Augst at sunset and for half an hour after when the atmosphere was clear but after a rainy day or when the air was loaded with vapours nothing of it was seen  The following flowers emitted flashes more or less vivid in this order  The Marigold  Calendula Officinalis    Garden Nasturtion Tropaeolum majus  Orange Lily Lilium bulbiferum  The Indian Pink Tagetes patula et crecta  Sometimes it was also observed on the Sunflowers H linthus annuus But bright yellow or flame colour seemed in general necessary for the production of this light for it was never seen on the flowers of any other colour  To discover whether some little insects or phosphoric worms might not be the cause of it the flowers were carefully examined even with a microscope without any such being sound  From the rapidity of the flash and other circumstances it might be conjectured that there is something of electricity in this phaenomenon It is well known that when the  pistil  of a flower is impregnated the  pollen  bursts away by its elasticity with which electricity may be combined But M Haggren after having observed the flash from the Orangelily the  anthers  of which are a considerable space distant from the  petals  found that the light proceeded from the  petals  only whence he concludes that this electric light is caused by the  pollen  which in flying off is scattered upon the  petals  Obser Physìque par M Rozier Vol XXXIII p  P  Addition to Avena  The following lines were by mistake omitted they were designed to have been inserted after l p  Green

language  BohonUpas  and has been described by naturalists but their accounts have been so tinctured with the  marvellou  that the whole narration has been supposed to be an ingenious fiction by the generality of readers Nor is this in the least degree surprising when the circumstances which we shall faithfully relate in this description are considered  I must acknowledge that I long doubted the existence of this tree until a stricter enquiry convinced me of my error I shall now only relate simple unadorned facts of which I have been an eyewitness My readers may depend upon the fidelity of this account In the year I was stationed at Batavia as a surgeon in the service of the Dutch EastIndia Company During my residence there I received several different accounts of the Bohon Upas and the violent effects of its poison They all then seemed incredible to me but raised my curiosity in so high a degree that I resolved to investigate this subject thoroughly and to trust only to my own observations In consequence of this resolution I applied to the GovernorGeneral Mr Petrus Albertus van der Parra for a pass to travel through the country my request was granted and having procured  every information I set out on my expedition I had procured a recommendation from an old Malayan priest to another priest who lives on the nearest inhabitable spot to the tree which is about fifteen or sixteen miles distant The letter proved of great service to me in my undertaking as that priest is appointed by the Emperor to reside there in order to prepare for eternity the souls of those who for different crimes are sentenced to approach the tree and to procure the poison  The  BohonUpas  is situated in the island of  Java  about twentyseven leagues from  Batavia  fourteen from  Soura Charta  the seat of the Emperor and between eighteen and twenty leagues from  Tinkjoe  the present residence of the Sultan of Java It is surrounded on all sides by a circle of high hills and mountains and the country round it to the distance of ten or twelve miles from the tree is entirely barren Not a tree nor a shrub nor even the least plant or grass is to be seen I have made the tour all around this dangerous spot at about eighteen miles distant from the centre and I found the aspect of the country on all sides equally dreary The easiest ascent of the hills is from that part where the old ecclesiaslick dwells From his house the criminals are sent for the poison into which the points of all warlike instruments are dipped It is of high value and produces a considerable revenue to the Emperor  Account of the manner in which the Poison is procured  The poison which is procured from this tree is a gum that issues out between the bark and the tree itself like the  camphor  Malefactors who for their crimes are sentenced to die are the only persons who fetch the poison and this is the only chance they have of saving their lives After sentence is pronounced upon them by the judge they are asked in court whether they will die by the hands of the executioner or whether they will go to the Upas tree for a box of poison They commonly prefer the latter proposal as there is not only some chance of preserving their lives but also a certainty in case of their safe return that a provision will be made for them in future by the Emperor They are also permitted to ask a favour from the Emperor which is generally of a triffing nature and commonly granted They are then provided with a silver or tortoiseshell box in which they are to put the poisonous gum and are properly instructed how to proceed while they are upon their dangerous expedition Among other particulars they are always told to attend to the direction of the winds as they are to go towards the tree before the wind so that the effluvia from the tree are always blown from them They are told likewise to travel with the utmost dispatch as that is the only method of insuring a safe return They are afterwards sent to the house of the old priest to which place they are commonly attended by their friends and relations Here they generally remain some days in expectation of a favourable breeze During that time the ecclesiastic prepares them for their future fate by prayers and admonitions  When the hour of their departure arrives the priest puts them on a long leathercap with two glasses before their eyes which comes down as far as their breast and also provides them with a pair of leathergloves They are then conducted by the priest and their friends and relations about two miles on their journey Here the priest repeats his instructions and tells them where they are to look for the tree He shews them a hill which they are told to ascend and that on the other side they will find a rivulet which they are to follow and which will conduct them directly to the Upas They now take leave of each other and amidst prayers for their success the delinquents hasten away  The worthy old ecclesiastic has assured me that during his residence there for upwards of thirty years he had dismissed above seven hundred criminals in the manner which I have described and that scarcely two out of twenty have returned He shewed me a catalogue of all the unhappy sufferers with the date of their departure from his house annexed and a list of the offences for which they had been condemned to which was added a list of those who had returned in safety I afterwards saw another list of these culprits at the jailkeeper's at  SouraCharta  and found that they perfectly corresponded with each other and with the different informations which I afterwards obtained  I was present at some of these melancholy ceremonies and desired different delinquents to bring with them some pieces of the wood or a small branch or some leaves of this wonderful tree I have also given them silk cords desiring them to measure its thickness I never could procure more than two dry leaves that were picked up by one of them on his return and all I could learn from him concerning the tree itself was that it flood on the border of a rivulet as described by the old priest that it was of a middling size that five or six young trees of the same kind stood close by it but that no other shrub or plant could be seen near it and that the ground was of a brownish sand full of stones almost impracticable for travelling and covered with dead bodies After many conversations with the old Malayan priest I questioned him about the first discovery and asked his opinion of this dangerous tree upon which he gave me the following answer  We are told in our new Alcoran that above an hundred years ago the country around the tree was inhabited by a people strongly addicted to the sins of Sodom and Gomorrha when the great prophet Mahomet determined not to suffer them to lead such detestable lives any longer he applied to God to punish them upon which God caused this tree to grow out of the earth which destroyed them all and rendered the country for ever uninhabitable  Such was the Malayan opinion I shall not attempt a comment but must observe that all the Malayans consider this tree as an holy instrument of the great prophet to punish the sins of mankind and therefore to die of the poison of the Upas is generally  considered among them as an honourable death For that reason I also observed that the delinquents who were going to the tree were generally dressed in their best apparel  This however is certain though it may appear incredible that from fifteen to eighteen miles round this tree not only no human creature can exist but that in that space of ground no living animal of any kind has ever been discovered I have also been assured by several persons of veracity that there are no fish in the waters nor has any rat mouse or any other vermin been seen there and when any birds fly so near this tree that the effuvia reaches them they fall a sacrifice to the effects of the poison This circumstance has been ascertained by different delinquents who in their return have seen the birds drop down and have picked them up  dead  and brought them to the old ecclesiastick  I will here mention an instance which proves them a fact beyond all doubt and which happened during my stay at Java  In the year a rebellion broke out among the subjects of the Massay a sovereign prince whose dignity is nearly equal to that of the Emperor They refused to pay a duty imposed upon them by their sovereign whom they openly opposed The Massay sent a body of a thousand troops to disperse the rebels and to drive them with their families out of his dominions Thus four hundred families consisting of above sixteen hundred souls were obliged to leave their native country Neither the Emperor nor the Sultan would give them protection not only because they were rebels but also through sear of displeasing their neighbour the Massay In this distressful situation they had no other resource than to repair to the uncultivated parts round the Upas and requested permission of the Emperor to settle there Their request was granted on condition of their fixing their abode not more than twelve or fourteen miles from the tree in order not to deprive the inhabitants already settled there at a greater distance of their cultivated lands With this they were obliged to comply but the consequence was that in less than two months their number was reduced to about three hundred The chiefs of those who remained returned to the Massay informed him of their losses and intreated his pardon which induced him to receive them again as subjects thinking them sufficiently punished for their misconduct I have seen and conversed with several of those who survived soon after their return They all had the appearance of persons tainted with an infectious disorder they looked pale and weak and from the account which they gave of the loss of their comrades of the symptoms and circumstances which attended their dissolution such as convulsions and other signs of a violent death I was fully convinced that they fell victims to the poison  This violent effect of the poison at so great a distance from the tree certainly appears surprising and almost incredible and especially when we consider that it is possible for delinquents who approach the tree to return alive My wonder however in a great measure ceased after I had made the following observations  I have said before that malefactors are instructed to go to the tree with the wind and to return against the wind When the wind continues to blow from the same quarter while the delinquent travels thirty or six and thirty miles if he be of a good constitution he certainly survives But what proves the most destructive is that there is no dependence on the wind in that part of the world for any length of timeThere are no regular landwinds and the seawind is not perceived there at all the situation of the tree being at too great a distance and surrounded by high mountains and uncultivated forests Besides the wind there never blows a fresh regular gale but is commonly merely a current of light soft breezes which pass through the different openings of the adjoining mountains It is also frequently difficult to determine from what part of the globe the wind really comes as it is divided by various obstructions in its passage which easily change the direction of the wind and often totally destroy its effects  I therefore impute the distant effects of the poison in a great measure to the constant gentle winds in those parts which have not power enough to disperse the poisonous particles If high winds are more frequent and durable there they would certainly weaken very much and even destroy the obnoxious effluvia of the poison but without them the air remains infected and pregnant with these poisonous vapours  I am the more convinced of this as the worthy ecclesiastick assured me that a dead calm is always attended with the greatest danger as there is a continual perspiration issuing from the tree which is seen to rise and spread in the air like the putrid steam of a marshy cavern  Experiments made with the Gum of the UPASTREE  IN the year in the month of February I was present at the execution of thirteen of the Emperor's concubines at  SouraCharta  who were convicted of infidelity to the Emperor's bed It was in the forenoon about eleven o'clock when the fair criminals were led into an open space within the walls of the Emperor's palace There the judge passed sentence upon them by which they are doomed to suffer death by a lancet poisoned with Upas After this the Alcoran was presented to them and they were according to the law of their great prophet Mahomet to acknowledge and to affirm by oath that the charges brought against them together with the sentence and their punishment were fair and equitable This they did by laying their right hand upon the Alcoran their left hands upon their breast and their eyes lifted towards heaven the judge then held the Alcoran to their lips and they kissed it  These ceremonies over the executioner proceeded on his business in the following mannerThirteen posts each about five feet high had been previously erected To these the delinquents were fastened and their breasts stripped naked In this situation they remained a short time in continual prayers attended by several priests until a signal  was given by the judge to the executioner on which the latter produced an instrument much like the spring lancet used by farriers for bleeding horses With this instrument it being poisoned with the gum of the Upas the unhappy wretches were lanced in the middle of their breasts and the operation was performed upon them all in less than two minutes  My astonishment was raised to the highest degree when I beheld the sudden effects of that poison for in about five minutes after they were lanced they were taken with a  tremor  attended with a  subsultus tendinum  after which they died in the greatest agonies crying out to God and Mahomet for mercy In sixteen minutes by my watch which I held in my hand all the criminals were no more Some hours after their death I observed their bodies full of livid spots much like those of the  Petech  ae  their faces swelled their colour changed to a kind of blue their eyes looked yellow c c  About a fortnight after this I had an opportunity of seeing such another execution at Samarang Seven Malayans were executed there with the same instrument and in the same manner and I found the operation of the poison and the spots in their bodies exactly the same  These circumstances made me desirous to try an experiment with some animals in order to be convinced of the real effects of this poison and as I had then two young puppies I thought them the fittest objects for my purpose I accordingly procured with great difficulty some grains of Upas I dissolved half a grain of that gum in a small quantity of arrack and dipped a lancet into it With this poisoned instrument I made an incision in the lower muscular part of the belly in one of the puppies Three minutes after it received the wound the animal began to cry out most piteously and ran as last as possible from one corner of the room to the other So it continued during six minutes when all its strength being exhausted it fell upon the ground was taken with convulsions and died in the eleventh minute I repeated this experiment with two other puppies with a cat and a fowl and found the operation of the poison in all of them the same none of these animals survived above thirteen minutes  I thought it necessary to try also the effect of the poison given inwardly which I did in the following manner I dissolved a quarter of a grain of the gum in half an ounce of arrack and made a dog of seven months old drink it In seven minutes a retching ensued and I observed at the same time that the animal was delirious as it ran up and down the room fell on the ground and tumb  ed about then it rose again cried out very loud and in about half an hour after was seized with convulsions and died I opened the body and found the stomach very much inflamed as the intestines were in some parts but not so much as the stomach There was a small quantity of coagulated blood in the stomach but I could discover no orifice from which it could have issued and therefore supposed it to have been squeezed cut of the lungs by the animal's straining while it was vomiting  From these experiments I have been convinced that the gum of the Upas is the most dangerous and most violent of all vegetable poisons and I am apt to believe that it greatly contributes to the unhealthiness of that island Nor is this the only evil attending it hundreds of the natives of Java as well as Europeans are yearly destroyed and treacherously murdered by that poison either internally or externally Every man of quality or fashion has his dagger or other arms poisoned with it and in times of war the Malayans poison the springs and other waters with it by this treacherous practice the Dutch suffered greatly during the last war as it occasioned the loss of half their army For this reason they have ever since kept fish in the springs of which they drink the water and sentinels are placed near them who inspect the waters every hour to see whether the fish are alive If they march with an army or body of troops into an enemy's country they always carry live fish with them which they throw into the water some hours before they venture to drink it by which means they have been able to prevent their total destruction  This account I flatter myself will satisfy the curiosity of my readers and the few facts which I have related will be considered as a certain proof of the existence of this pernicious tree and its penetrating effects  If it be asked why we have not yet any more satisfactory accounts of this tree I can only answer that the object to most travellers to that part of the world consists more in commercial pursuits than in the study of Natural History and the advancement of Sciences Besides Java is so universally reputed an unhealthy island that rich travellers seldom make any long stay in it and other want money and generally are too ignorant of the language to travel in order to make enquiries In future those who visit this island will probably now be induced to make it an object of their researches and will furnish us with a fuller description of this tree  I will therefore only add that there exists also a sort of CajoeUpas on the coast of Macassar the poison of which operates nearly in the same manner but is not half so violent or malignant as that of Java and of which I shall likewise give a more circumstantial account in a description of that island  London Magazine  CATALOGUE OF THE POETIC EXHIBITION  CANTO I  GROUP of insects  Tender husband  Selfadmirer  Rival lovers  Coquet
