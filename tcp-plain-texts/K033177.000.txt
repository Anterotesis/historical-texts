Maria M'Saunderson  Mrs MARTYR  Susan  Mrs WILSON  THE CAMPAIGN c  ACT I  CHORUS  Officers  LET the voice of triumph rise  To hail with songs of joy this happy morn  On conquest's purple pinions borne  The martial sound shall reach the skies  Where the sun points his sloping ray  The burnish'd helm and spear with transient gleam  Glittering to the orient beam  With brighter radiance gild the day  CHORUS  Officers  When glory invites us  No danger alarms  When honour excites us  No pleasure has charms  Tho' beauty enthralls us  Her raptures we fly  When bright glory calls us  To conquer or die  His country requiring nor wit wine nor love  The heart of a soldier from honour can move  Tho' beauty may charm him his bold deeds proclaim  Who sighs for his nymph yet will bleed for his fame  SONG  Lucy  WHEN hope to raise the drooping heart  With flattering prospects points the scene  Weak is the bliss she can impart  For hope is ever mix'd with pain  II  Around the couch with roses spread  Where the sweet nymph reclines her head  Still her pale sisters doubt and fear  With trembling pinions flutter near  SONG  Maria  YET know that pity's tender sighs  Can this soften'd bosom swell  For when one faithful lover dies  Thus I ring his knell  Farewell farewell  Ding ding dong bell  But when another swain appears  Doom'd to fill the vacant place  I dry my eyes for constant tears  Serve but to spoil the face  SONG  Lucy  HARK ye my dear but don't tell  Tho' my Daddy may try to persuade  La la la la  I'll never lead apes in hell  La la la la  As I must if I die an old maid  II  Coy maids oft' frown and deny  When the youth of their hearts speak his mind  Yet maids they wish not to die  La la la la  And that truth perhaps shortly you'll find  SONG  Farquahar  IN Carlow town there liv'd a maid  More fair than flowers at daybreak  Their vows contending lovers paid  But none of marriage dar'd speak  Still with a sigh  'Twas Oh I die  Each day my passion's stronger  When sprightly Nancy straight would say  You'll die dear sir the Irish way  To live a little longer  II  At length grown jealous Venus cries  This pride is past all bearing  And straight sent Mars down from the skies  In form of Captain Daring  First with a sigh  He cried I die  The god found passion stronger  And sprightly Nancy still did say  You'll die dear sir the Irish way  To live a little longer  III  At length like soldier bold he press'd  And quickly saw by Nancy  The snow was thaw'd all in her breast  A soldier caught her fancy  With downcast eye  She breath'd a sigh  Her passions still grew stronger  'Till Nancy was oblig'd to say  I'll die myself the Irish way  To live a little longer  SONG  Saib  SWEET is the blackbird's whistled note  Sweet the thrush's mellow song  While the woodlark's liquid throat  Pours the warbled strain along  Sweet the music of the vocal grove  Sweeter the voice of her I love  SONG  Susan  PRAY what has a promise in it  If the heart be not sincere  Bubble of the present minute  Melting soon in empty air  II  Men still strive to overreach us  When we cheat the silly elves  Since we practise what they teach us  Let them only blame themselves  SONG  Gregory  KEEP off if you vex a woman  'Till she gives her passion vent  In her fury she spares no man  But her tongue goes click and clack  Click click clack and ticka ticke tack  'Till her rage in noise is spent  II  Women when the fidgets seize 'em  Ride one like a founder'd nag  They are gentle 'till you teize 'em  Then their tongue goes click and clack  Click click clack and ticka ticke tack  'Till it can no longer wag  SONG  Saib  FLATTERING hope no more deceive    Wherefore will you haunt thy breast  Fond deluder leave Oh leave me  I can never more be blest  II  Ah Sweet Syren lull no more  My senses with thy magic strain  The fancied dream of bliss is o'er  And now I wake to real pain  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SONG  Saib  A Breast cold to love is no where to be found  The grave and the gay all alike feel the wound  In vain the sweet poison we'd shun or we'd hide  It ebbs and it flows in the heart like a tide  Oh love sooth my heart  II  Doubt and fear are the guards that still wait upon love  In absence what pains two fond bosoms must prove  But the moment the cloud is remov'd from the sight  It's a whole year of sunshine for one single night  Oh love sooth my heart  II  The sun o'er our heads that in glory now shines  Ripes the di'mond and gold in rich India's sweet mines  But a gem lights the bosom of her I adore  Which will sparkle when di'monds and gold are no more  Oh love sooth my heart  SONG  Howitzer  WOMEN's tongues in motion  Are restless as the ocean  For when their clack  Begins to crack  No mortal can the blow shun  II  Female truth's a fable  The widow in her fable  Ne'er sighs in bed  For husbands dead  But those alive and able  III  Woman's heart's a riddle  With men they toil and fiddle  Then here they skip  And there they trip  Like geese upon a griddle  IV  Maids when with lads they spark it  Wou'd still the golden mark hit  The fairest toast  Asks who bids most  Like cattle brought to market  DUETT  Susan  and  Gregory  Greg  SUSAN will you love me  Sus  No no no  Surely you have impudence all impupudence exceeding  Greg  You must kiss me Susan  Sus  No no no  Marry set you up Sir I prithee let me go  Think not that one of my breeding  Ever will descend so low  Greg  Stay my dear you must not go  Come this anger's all pretending  Sure I know you love me  Sus  No no no  You'll see Mr Simpleton what it will end in  Greg  Let us kiss and friends then  Sus  No no no  Never never Lord how can you teaze a body so  SONG  Susan  Wherefore languish  Pale with anguish  Tho' she swears she'll ne'er be kind  Don't believe her  Maids are ever  Gently forc'd to change their mind  II  Then take courage  Mind not her rage  Tho' she frowning answer no  If she's tender  She'll surrender  If she's tough e'en let her go  SONG  Drill and  CHORUS  COME hither all ye lads  Who lead unhappy lives  Whom bailiffs hunt or duns molest  Or scolding wives  To the standard all advancing  Drink in plenty singing dancing  The drum calls away  My lads no longer stay  To the standard c  II  All ye to cruel masters  Bound in servile chains  Who make you work  Like Jew or Turk  And starve you for your pains  To the standard c  SONG  Rifle  MERRILY rolls the soldiers life  Come my brave boys all fill your glasses  Joy succeeds to toil and strife  Fill to the brim a health to our lasses  While jovial thus we laugh and sing  The circling hours new pleasures bring  Merrily merrily frolic and play  And sport the cares of life away  Laughs  SONG  Gregory  THO' to eating and sleeping a stranger  He gives me no thanks but a blow or a kick  Ty'd up like a dog in a manger  But my collar I've slipt and I'll play him a trick  His house but a cage is  His beggarly wages  Sour crout and sausages  I pitch to old Nick  II  Tho' I work like a mule or a neger  Till my heart like my coat to tatters is rent  My visage pale hollow and meagre  My stomach and guts still doom'd to keep lent  Tho' toiling and drudging  Yet sour and in dudgeon  The cross old curmudgeon  Is never content  SONG  Susan  THO' now you saucy and proud are  You sot too late you'll find  When food for ball and powder  You've left your brains behind  You fool when hunger pinches  You'll rot and die by inches  Glad for a morsel to beg  Tho' now you saucy and proud are  Propp'd on a wooden leg  SONG  Gregory  ZOUNDS do not lay so hard on  Pox take you all unhand me oh  Good sir I ask your pardon  I'll do as you command me oh  Hold hold sir  Behold sir  My sides all black and blue are grown  Your ferkins  And jerkins  Would wear me soon to skin and bone  You've beat me to a jelly  My heart with those disasters  Is sunk into my belly  Hold hold c  SONG  Maria  'TWAS not his shape or air  So smart and debonair  That stole my heart away  Wit or speaking eyes  Vows or melting sighs  'Twas something I knew not what  'Twas neither this or that  Something I cannot say  SONG  Farquar  OH chide not my charmer nor think me a rover  A Soldier of course is a general lover  With a row dow stand clear all  Ye beauties both high and low  Oh in love still I must fall  Sweet creatures where'er I go  II  One day I bow down to the toasts of the city  And next am in love with a barmaid if ptetty  With a row dow c  III  Those eyes and those lips like two ripe budding roses  To temptation still my heart it exposes  With a row dow c  IV  I meet beauties like you and my fancy they bother  And make me adore your sweet self in another  With a row dow c  SONG  Saib  FROM tree to tree from flow'r to flow'r  The inconstant Zephyr strays  Not e'en the sweetest rose has pow'r  To fix his wand'ring breeze  II  The faithful stream that round yon hill  Its winding current leads  In Its first channel murmurs still  Nor roves to distant meads  III  Ah heedless youth behold in these  The emblems of our flame  Thine rover is the wand'ring breeze  And mine the faithful stream  DUETT  Lucy  and  Saib  IF you would know what pain it is to part  Ask ask this bleeding heart  That almost breaks when I must leave thee  To you I'll still prove true till death  And then I'll spend my latest breath  In sighs my love that I must leave thee  END OF ACT SECOND  ACT III  SONG  Sulphur  FAR hence away  Banish care and sorrow  Laugh and sing today  Death may come tomorrow  Let's drink then while we may  'Tis wine that makes us brisk and gay  CHORUS  'Tis wine c  II  Far  Should Cupid's dart  Your lover wound and teaze you  From the cruel smart  No power on earth can ease you  'Till Bacchus aid impart  'Tis wine that chears and warms the heart  CHORUS  'Tis wine c  III  Flag  No bliss sincere  The gods on earth have granted  Love brings despair  And wealth by care is haunted  True pleasure would you share  In wine are joys unmix'd with care  CHORUS  In wine c  SONG  Lucy  THE dawn its pure blushes spreads over the ground  While nature breathes fresh all the fragrance around  The goldfinch and linnet sing blythe from the thorn  And the lark sweetly carols his hymn to the morn  II  But the goldfinch and linnet now warble in vain  And joyless to me is the sungilded plain  Nor the sweet breathing morn nor the songs of the grove  Can soothe the fond bosom that's tortur'd by love  QUARTETTO  Farquar Saib Lucy Maria  WITH mirth and good humour a dance and a song  Let the eve like the morn glide with pleasure along  And night from our bosoms all cares shall remove  But the sweetest of cares the soft tumults of love  SONG  Rifle  IF you wou'd learn to be a soldier  Cock your hat fiercely and march wiih a bold air  Fill all your thoughts with bloodshed and battle  And make the air ring when your firelocks you rattle  CHORUS  Fal lal lal c  II  Squeeze back your shoulders and thrust out your craw Sir  And strut to and fro like a stately jackdaw Sir  Look well all around you and cry to each stranger  Answer "who goes there" or your life is in danger  CHORUS  Fal lal lal c  AIR  Gregory The words by Mr O'Keeffe  YE servingmen both great and small  Of high and low degree  As I stand here see my downfall  And warning take by me  Too late I find that to my cost  Preferment all is vain  I willingly resign my post  To get my place again  With a cut slash dash and a gravy sop  Hob nob  Tingle gingle  Then to wash the way down with a chirping drop  II  Men I must kill with my firelock  Who ne'er a man cou'd lick  And never kill'd but once a cock  And that was with my stick  To such I ne'er wou'd turn my back  So much I'll safely boast  No drum need beat to the attack  Of either boil'd or roast  With a cut c  III  You ne'er shall say away I ran  In such a glorious work  I am a valiant trencherman  My weapons knife and fork  A rush I care not for the French  What's Tippoo Saib to me  Sweet Susan come kind rosy wench  My captain you shall be  With a cut c  SONG  Gregory  I NOW am a slave and a tool  Afraid of the stick and the rod  No schoolboy e'er trembled at school  As I do at Corporal Squad  II  I thought him as great as the King  When he gave me a shilling ecod  But soon I will caper and sing  And Old Nick may take Corporal Squad  FINALE  PEACE mild peace on seraphs wings  Wafted o'er the distant main  Every bliss propitious brings  Pleasure sporting in her train  War and frantic discord cease  Cease to spread destruction round  Drums redouble trumpets sound  To the welcome voice of peace  THE END
