 THE  SouthSea  SCHEME EXAMIN'D  c  Price ThreePence  THE  SOUTHSEA  SCHEME EXAMIN'D AND The  Reasonableness  thereof DEMONSTRATED  By a hearty WellWisher to PUBLICK CREDIT  The SECOND EDITION  LONDON  Printed for J ROBERTS near the  OxfordArms  in  WarwickLane  MDCCXX  PREFACE TO THE READER  _WERE the following small Performance answerable to its Design or the Spirit which gave Birth to it there would require no Apology to justify the Publishing of that to the World which at first was only intended for private Information However it is hoped that the Intention with which it was wrote being to contribute to the Support of Publick Credit  will make some Atonement for that Deficiency recommend it to a candid Acceptance from the Publick and obtain a Pardon for those Mistakes which may be found in it especially when the Reader is assured that there is no Ʋntruth designedly advanced and that the whole is both wrote and published without the Direction Privity or Assistance of any Person whatsoever but the Author  THE  SouthSea  SCHEME EXAMIN'D  c  _THE calamitous Circumstances in which too many are involved from the present languishing State of Publick Credit is a Matter of too great Importance to be pass'd by unregarded It calls upon every Person who bears any Regard to the Interest of his Country to exert himself in the Support of that Credit wherein no  Briton  can be unconcerned  The Design of the few following Leaves is not to reflect but to examine not to flatter but to state not to aggravate but to reconcile every Man to his own Interest by making an impartial and fair Examination into the  SouthSea  Scheme and endeavouring to demonstrate the Reasonableness thereof after the best Manner which a Person furnish  d only with such Materials as have been published is enabled to do  In order therefore to conceive as clearly as possible of the real Value of  SouthSea  Stock as well as of the Reasonableness of the Terms given to all the Proprietors of the Debts redeemable and irredeemable I shall pursue the following Method  First I shall lay down a short State of the several Branches which compose the Debts already subscribed or to be subscribed into the  SouthSea  Stock and those are commonly distinguished as follows  viz        Stock to be allowed     l  l  Long Annuities  per A  num                  R  Cent              The Government allowing the Company Years Purchase for every long Annuity and Years Purchase for every short One gives them a Liberty to create  l  or thereabouts new Stock and thereby to enlarge their Capital till it amounts to  l  Stock or thereabouts Thus much for the particular Branches to be taken into the Stock  Secondly Let us enquire into the Amount of the  SouthSea  Stock provided the whole Debt was subscribed upon the Terms proposed And upon this Head it will be necessary to distinguish between that Part of the irredeemable Debt subscribed last  April  at  l  and the remaining Part thereof together with the redeemable Debt to be taken in at  l per Cent  Subscribed in  April  at  l per Cent  l per Annum  Stock    Long Annuities at Years Purchase      per Cent  for each  per An  Stock    Lottery about           per Cent Midsum  Dividend    Total Stock given for the above Annuities    It is to be observed that the last mentioned Capital may not be perfectly exact by reason no Distinction is made between the Years Annuities and the  per Cents  they both being included under one Head of Long Annuities and the like Years Purchase in Stock given for each The same is to be observed of the Lottery where Blanks and Prizes are likewise included under the same Head But this causes little Difference in the Capital Stock given for either but only in the Bonds  Remaining Part of the Debts as well Redeemable as Irredeemable to be taken into the Stock at  l per Cent     Sto  k  Ann  L  Long Annuities Years Pur  in Stock    per Cents  at ¼ Ditto    Lottery  at Ditto    Redeemables at and  per Cent  at  l          given for the above    Dividend of  l per Cent  thereon          Debts    given at    l per Cent          Total Stock given for the whole Debt    Hence it is evident that about  l  Capital Stock or thereabouts would redeem the whole  l  of Debts supposing the same to be all subscribed into the Stock upon the beforementioned Terms The Bonds excepted in this Account     L  The Original Capital including the  Midsummer  Dividend    Stock given for the Debts          Total Amount    Supposing the whole Debt to be thus subscribed what remains of the Stock may either be sold or divided out in such manner as shall be most advantageous to the Company Of which the underwritten Sums have been sold upon the following Considerations  viz  In each Sum the    l  per Cent  Dividend is included     Quantity of Stock sold  Total Value  L  st Money Subscription      d        d      th      Agreed with the  Bank               Total Stock sold  sold for    Former Capital                  Total Cap  tal       Here it must be observ'd that the  SouthSea  Capital at present does not amount to  l  by reason the whole Debt is not subscribed in so that probably there may be yet Millions of Stock to dispose of  Having thus far given some View of the Amount of the  South Sea  Capital I shall endeavour to demonstrate the Reasonableness of the Terms given by the  SouthSea  Company as well as the Advantageousness of accepting them To do which in the most convincing manner I shall beg Leave to set a Valuation upon the respective Funds at the Time the Company first began to engage to redeem them And then shew the Advantage accruing from the Exchange  First as to the Valuation of the respective Funds  The Long Annuities never exceeded Years Purchase and were look'd upon as very dear at that Rate it bringing but  l per Ann  to the Purchaser  The  per Cents  and Lottery sold for about Years Purchase  The and  per Cent  Redeemables cannot be valued at above  Par  as they were liable to be paid off at any time without Notice And I believe it is pretty certain that the Proprietors of the  l per Cent  Funds would gladly have accepted of  l per Cent  rather than have been paid off  If this be a fair Valuation let us examine into the Reasonableness and Advantageousness of the Terms given by the  SouthSea  Company  And First Every Long Annuitant who subscribed in  April  last received in Stock Bonds and Money after the Rate of ½ Years Purchase for an Annuity which till then was not worth more than Years Purchase  In like manner every Proprietor of the  per Cents  or Lottery received in Stock Bonds and Money about ½ Years Purchase for what would not have sold for  As to the Terms at present given to the d Subscribers they receive in Stock after the Rate of ½ Years Purchase  And the  per Cents  and Lottery receive in Stock about ½ Years Purchase  Every Proprietor of the Redeemables receives  l  Stock for  l  Interest being allowed to them to  Michaelmas  which in Effect is taking the Stock at  l    s per Cent  It will easily be perceived from what is advanced that the  SouthSea  Stock is valued at  l per Cent  which perhaps may be objected to considering the Price it sells for  And here it must be confess'd with the greatest Concern that unreasonable Jealousies groundless Fears the most unaccountable Apprehensions or rather an universal Infatu  ion has so far seized on Mankind as to run down the Stock much below its Value and beyond all Expectation to the un  ing of many and the Loss of most Although every Proceeding which has in some measure occasioned these Losses is far from being justifiable yet a great Number of em must be attributed to the Misconduct of those upon whom they have fall  S  e arising  from an insatiable Des  g  ing Treas  not thought of by our Ancestors and thereby have neglected  Oppo  which would have  Happiness  to themselves  and their Families while others by purchasing vastly beyond what their Abilities could make good are plunged into irretrievable Ruin  But to come to the main Point which is to endeavour to shew the due Value of the Stock  I hope no one will in this Particular too strictly adhere to  Hudibras  's Rule which implies that nothing is worth more than it will bring For at present it must be said that the  SouthSea  Stock sells at a Discount and below its Value  For were the Stock to be sold only at  l per Cent  and every Man should determine to dispose of his own it would be impossible to find Purchasers for it and yet the Stock in Reality would be no ways the worse for it And to demonstrate this the more clearly Suppose every Proprietor of a Landed Estate should resolve to sell it it would not be possible among our selves to find Purchasers at Years Purchase for the whole Though every Man at present would look upon an Estate at Years Purchase as a most extraordinary Bargain And yet no Man thinks the worse of his Estate or would be induc'd to part with it upon so small a Consideration  To judge of the real Value of the Stock must be by the Dividends the Company will be able to make upon the Stock and the Continuance of them And I hope to make it appear that the Stock is worth  l per Cent  by shewing that the Company is able to divide after the Rate of  per Cent  upon their Stock for such a Number of Years as will reimburse every Proprietor his full Principal and Interest for every Share purchased at that Rate  These Dividends are to be made good out of the Annual Sums payable by the Go+vernment and out of the Profits which the Company gain or make by their Stock  Their Profits arise three Ways from the Stock already sold the remaining Part to he disposed of and the Loans upon the Stock  I presume it is not to be expected from a private Person to point out at what Times in what Proportions and at what Rates the remaining Stock should be disposed of that being submitted to the Ability and Management of those Gentlemen whose P  is But this I beg leave to say that  payable by the Government to the Company the Profits already  made the Advantages of their Loans and a prudent Disposition of what remains will enable the Company to divide  per Cent  upon their Stock for such a Term of Years as will reimburse every Proprietor his full Principal and Interest  As for Instance every Long Annuitant subscribing  l per Annum  upon the first Proposal receives  l per Annum  which if continued Years Reimburses a Principal Sum of  l  with Interest of  l per Cent  thereon Which Sum was the just Value or Worth of his Annuity So that the Subscriber not only receives an annual Sum of  l  in Lieu of  l  but is a Gainer of  l  Capital Stock and  l  in Bonds or Money over and above the  l  by him subscribed  Upon the last Proposal every long Annuitant receives  l  for his subscribed  l per Annum  which gives the like Addition to his yearly Income and will reimburse the Sum of  l  with  l per Cent  Interest in Years and he be further entitled to  l  Capital Stock without Bonds  Every short Annuitant will in Years be reimbursed the respective Sum by him  subscribed the same being valued at  Years Purchase with Interest thereon at  per Cent  and be a Gainer of so much Stock or Bonds as he received for them  As to the Redeemable Proprietors they receive the Stock as has been before obser+ved at the Rate of  l    s per Cent  ▪ which bears Interest after the Rate of abou    l    s    d  upon the Sum subscribed▪ Which continued for Years will reim+burse the Principal and Interest to the Pro+prietors at  l per Cent  and in Years a    l per Cent  and they be Gainers of the Stock they possess  Whatever further may be thought upon for the Service of the Company 'tis not to be doubted but the Legislative Power will grant every thing reasonable to enable them to go thro so great an Undertaking as that of reducing the whole National Debt  Having gone through all the Particulars I at first proposed and endeavour'd to demonstrate the Reasonableness of the  SouthSea  Scheme as well as to shew the Advantages arising thereby I beg Leave to address my self to every body in Defence and Support of the Publick Credit because  the Evil being from our selves must by our selves be relieved  I shall call upon every Body because no Person is unconcerned as every one will find when 'tis too late that does not exert himself in this Just and National Cause  Those who enjoy Favours from the Government are first obliged by their Authority Example and Advice to engage themselves and all others over whom they have any Influence in this just Cause Those who receive no particular Favours from the Government but live in the quiet and peaceable Enjoyment of their own and profess themselves and would be treated as Friends to this present happy Establishment ought not to be unactive for its Support much less if not necessitated to make any Demand to distress the Publick Credit  Those not engaged in the publick Funds are as much concerned to support the Credit of them as those engaged as all will feel the good or ill Effects of their Support or Decay  A Decay of Credit must unavoidably end in a Decay of Substance The Farmer will find no Market to take off the Produce and  Effects of his Labour and consequently be unable to pay his Landlord The Merchants will find no Demands for their Commodities and the industrious Manufacturer no Employment for his Hands As the Poor will increase the Means of relieving them will lessen daily  These are Circumstances which should awaken all of us to guard against them as they are more easy to be prevented than remedied  Let us not join Hands to work out our own Destruction and give up that Peace Trade and Wealth which the united Power and Artifices of our Enemies has hitherto in vain laboured to rob us of  Let no Man through unjust Fears or groundless Jealousies lock up his Treasure in his Coffers and boast himself upon a Security which will prove imaginary Let every Man place his Strength in the Support of the Government and the Prosperity of his Country And as there is no Attempt made to hurt us let every Man consider where such Interest is allowed or such Security given for Money as in Great  Britain  Where has publick Faith ever been so inviolably maintained What greater  Security can be desired where all the publick Funds are appropriated the Interest Wealth and Credit of the whole Nation is engaged to support as it now is by the late happy and seasonable Agreement between the Bank of  England  and the  SouthSea  Company  Upon the whole as we are blessed with a wise and good Prince a faithfull and able Ministry and a Parliament capable and disposed to concert such Measures as tend to the common Interest of all Let us join our Endeavours to their Resolutions to retrieve the Difficulties we labour under then will our Credit soon revive our Trade flourish and we become a great happy and powerful People to all succeeding Generations  POSTSCRIPT  THE Amount of the Bonds and other Debts owing by the  SouthSea  Company being unknown no Notice has been taken of them in the foregoing Account But they are left to be accounted for out of the future Profits and Advantages to be made by the Company  FINIS
