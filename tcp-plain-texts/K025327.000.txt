COLMAN  Spoken by Mrs MATTOCKS  THE law of custom is the law of fools  And yet the wise are govern'd by her rules  Why should  Men  only prologue all our plays  GentlemenUshers to each modern Bayes  Why are the Fair to Epilogues confin'd  Whose tongues are loud and gen'ral as the wind  Mark how in real life each sex is class'd  Woman has  there  the  first  word and the  last  Boast not your gallant deeds romantic men  Tonight a Female Quixote draws the pen  Arm'd by the Comic Muse these lists she enters  And sallies forthin quest of strange adventures  War open war 'gainst recreant knights declares  Nor GiantVice nor WindmillFolly spares  Sidesaddles Pegasus and courts Apollo  While I you see her female Sancho follow  Ye that in this enchanted castle sit  Dames squires and dark magicians of the pit  Smile on our fair knighterrantry today  And raise no spells to blast a female play  Oft has our Author upon other ground  Courted your smiles and oft indulgence found  Read in the closet you approv'd her page  Yet still she dreads the perils of the stage  Reader with Writer due proportion keeps  And if the Poet nods the Critic sleeps  If lethargied by dullness here you sit  Sonorous catcalls rouse the sleeping pit  Plac'd at the threshold of the weatherhouse  There stands a pasteboard husband and his spouse  Each doom'd to mark the changes of the weather  But stilltrue man and wifene'er seen together  When low  ing clouds the face of heav'n deform  The muffled husband stands and braves the storm  But when the fury of the tempest's done  Break out at once the Lady and the Sun  Thus oft has man in custom's beaten track  Come forth as doleful Prologue all in black  Gloomy prognostick of the ba  a's disgrace  With omens of foul weather in his face  Trick'd out in silk and smiles let me appear  And six as sign of peace the rainbow here  Raise your compassion and your mirth together  And prove today an emblem of fair weather  Dramatis Personae  Earl of Belmont

I should find you here my Lord this new taste for solitude is a mortal symptom in your distemper A lover seldom desires better company than his own thoughts  CLAIRVILLE  I should have been glad of your company however Why did you not join me sooner  COURTENEY  I come now to bring you unwelcome newsthe Earl of Belmont is in town  CLAIRVILLE  My father in town  COURTENEY  Will whom I sent to London upon some particular business is just now returned and tells me my Lord came from his countryseat two days ago  CLAIRVILLE  My dear Courteney I shall never be able to look my father in the faceTo return to England without his ordersto be three weeks here under a borrowed nameIf he has been informed of this how can I excuse my conduct  COURTENEY  Tell him the truth  CLAIRVILLE  The truth  COURTENEY  YesThat his Lordship in his last letter to you at Paris proposed a match to you your impatience to see the lady made you anticipate his orders for your return you left Paris  incognito  saw the lady at Ranelagh and  CLAIRVILLE  What then  COURTENEY  Are ready to obey him  CLAIRVILLE  Pshaw why will you trifle You know I cannot  COURTENEY  Cannot my Lord  gravely  CLAIRVILLE  No Lady Ann does not please me  COURTENEY  Because Miss D'Arcy pleases you too well  CLAIRVILLE  Pr'ythee do not torment me Courteney  COURTENEY  Doubtless his Lordship will excuse the violence of a passion which keeps you here at Windsor  under a fictitious name sighing at the feet of a young divinity that has visited this sublunary world in the shape of an humble dependant upon a haughty lady of quality  CLAIRVILLE  What a blunder has Fortune committed to place her in that stateCourteney she is an angel  COURTENEY  An angel Lovers have a fine creative fancy It costs them little to make angels goddesses nymphs  CLAIRVILLE  Are you apprehensive then that my passion for Miss D'Arcy may lead me too far  COURTENEY  Why truly my Lord there seems to be some reason for my apprehensionHowever this may be some particular business obliges me to leave you  CLAIRVILLE  Particular business Is this affair to be a secret to your friend  COURTENEY  I have no secrets that I would hide from you my Lord My sister whom you have often heard me mention with tenderness though I have not seen her since she was a child has privately withdrawn herself from an aunt with whom she has resided since the death of her parents and it is conjectured she is gone to Paris to meet me my last letter to her being dated from thence  CLAIRVILLE  Her aunt had made some  prudent  choice of a husband for her perhaps  COURTENEY  Nothe old lady is a bigoted Roman Catholickand having a large fortune to bestow attempted to make a proselyte of the poor girl promising her in that case to settle her estate upon her This failing she laid a scheme for entrapping her into a convent which my sister being informed of fled to me  CLAIRVILLE  Who gave you this intelligence  COURTENEY  A friend of my father's whom I accidentally met with upon the terrace who had seen me at Leyden while I was at the university there and knew me immediately We cannot hope you see to be longer concealed therefore it is absolutely necessary my Lord that you should present yourself as soon as possible to your fatherWhat do you resolve to do my Lord  CLAIRVILLE  Give me a day or two to consider  COURTENEY  But in the mean time my sister  CLAIRVILLE  TrueYou ought to fly immediately to her assistance  COURTENEY  And leave you here my Lord  CLAIRVILLE  Why not Do you doubt my prudence  COURTENEY  Your Lordship's in love  CLAIRVILLE  Can you think me weak enough to form a rash engagement with a young woman to whose birth and circumstances I am wholly a stranger  COURTENEY  You are in love my Lord  CLAIRVILLE  You are determined then to acquaint my father with my being here  COURTENEY  Certainly unless you resolve to present yourself to him immediately My friendship for you my Lord has already carried me farther than it ought I have indulged you in coming over privately that you might gratify your curiosity with a sight of the lady your father designs for you this done you promised to go back with me to Paris there to wait his express orders for your return but you have not kept your word You still linger here my remonstrances have hitherto been fruitless  CLAIRVILLE  Well since it must be so I will go back with you to Paris  COURTENEY  Were it not better to wait upon your father who is perhaps by this time informed of your return  CLAIRVILLE  I cannot see my father I cannot resolve to marry the lady he has chosen for me Kind and indulgent as he has ever been I have not fortitude enough to meet his frown I will write to him when we get to Paris and we will set out tomorrow Now are you satisfied  COURTENEY  I am my Lord your servant I will go home and give the necessary orders for our journey  CLAIRVILLE  Nay pr'ythee take a turn with me dear Courteney my heart is oppressed and I have a thousand things to say to you  COURTENEY  Your Lordship must excuse me we have not a moment to spare    Going Miss  Autumn  and Miss  Courteney  appear at a distance  Courteney  stops looks at them then comes back to  Clairville  and says    If your Lordship is only for a short walk I think I will accompany you  CLAIRVILLE  laughs  So you have a moment to spare then confess honestly that the sight of Miss Autumn has brought you back  COURTENEY  Miss Autumn sure my Lord you do not imagine that I would neglect any serious business for the conversation of such a vain coquet  CLAIRVILLE  Not unless you were in love Courteney  COURTENEY  Well I am not in love with Miss Autumn I do assure you my Lord  CLAIRVILLE  With whom then  COURTENEY  Nor with your Pastorella my Lord your blushing Dryad who with all her innocence and  simplicity has had art enough to ensnare your affections  CLAIRVILLE  Dear Courteney speak with more reverence of what I lovethey are again in sight shall we go round and meet them  COURTENEY  Well since it must be so I will attend you  Exeunt  Courteney  and  Clairville  SCENE II  Enter Miss  Autumn  and Miss  Courteney  MISS AUTUMN  It is very true my dear when I told you this morning that you would make but an awkward fine lady you surveyed yourself in my glass with a certain consciousness    mimicking her    well I will allow that you are tolerably handsome but half that bloom which you brought from the country might be spared provided you knew what to do with the remainderindeed Harriet I am almost ashamed of your simplicity  MISS COURTENEY  Why my dear whimsical friend what faults have I committed lately  MISS AUTUMN  Faults you never do one earthly thing that is rightall my documents are thrown away upon youyou blush truly when a sop looks attentively on youyou cannot meet the steady gaze with the confident stare You speak without lisping walk without tottering and courtesy without tossing back your head  MISS COURTENEY  All this is gross affectation  MISS AUTUMN  Indeed Harriet you are a silly girl with all your knowledgeyou have spent eighteen years of your life in cultivating your understanding without reflecting that it is by your beauty only you can hope to make your fortune cease to be wise child and grow prudent do not study the belle lettres but the belle airreason less with your tongue and more with your eyeswhy really now I believe you imagine nature gave you those two sparkling orbs for no other purpose but to see with  MISS COURTENEY  You railly your sex's follies so agreeably my dear that one would conclude you despised them were you not too often seen practising them yourselfyour eyes serve you for many other purposes besides seeing  MISS AUTUMN  My eyes child are welldisciplined troops they know how to attack conquer pursue retreat beg quarter  MISS COURTENEY  Beg quarter I am sure they will never give any if they can possibly help itwhat an obstinate siege have they laid to the heart of poor Freeman  MISS AUTUMN  True and they have carried the place at last you find  MISS COURTENEY  Well and what do you intend to do with it  MISS AUTUMN  Do with it why throw a garrison into it and march off to new conquests  MISS COURTENEY  I doubt the place is not tenable my dear two enemies to your power pride and resentment have got admittance and it is more than probable will expell your garrison  MISS AUTUMN  That indeed would be a great disgrace upon my generalship  MISS COURTENEY  Mr Freeman is a man of sense he has perceived that your design was only to torment him You are too much and too little of a coquet my fair friend and have not artifice enough to dissemble the want of it  MISS AUTUMN  Prodigious What the sage Harriet taking upon her to give me lessons in coquetry  MISS COURTENEY  I might profit by your faults were I disposed to commence coquet  MISS AUTUMN  Well since I find you have some skill I may venture to consult you sometimes upon my operations tell me truly then do you think Freeman will escape me  MISS COURTENEY  I think he has already  MISS AUTUMN  This would mortify me extremely if I did not despise the rebel  MISS COURTENEY  I perceive you do  MISS AUTUMN  Not that I think him despicable I assure you  MISS COURTENEY  No really  MISS AUTUMN  No really why is he not handsome has he not wit learning elegance  MISS COURTENEY  Ha ha ha and yet you despise him my dear  MISS AUTUMN  Despise himwhy yesand yet I do not despise him neither I only mean that I do not like him  MISS COURTENEY  Why should you not like him is he not handsome has he not wit learning elegance  MISS AUTUMN  Pooh to convince you that I do not like him observe how ill I will treat him the next time we meet  MISS COURTENEY  That will be the way to convince me that you do like him  MISS AUTUMN  Strange indeed you could not say more were I to treat him well  MISS COURTENEY  No but I should say as much  MISS AUTUMN  You have a mind to maintain paradoxes I perceive  MISS COURTENEY  Indeed you are mistaken I have no mind to be ridiculous the glitter of false wit like the shine of false jewels serve at once to shew the poverty and vanity of the possessor What I mean my dear is that if you are indeedindifferent towards Mr Freeman you will treat him with that general politeness which a man of real merit is sure to meet with from a woman of sense too much or too little attention to such a man is alike liable to be construed into a secret attachment  MISS AUTUMN  According to this rule my dear Harriet you have certainly a secret attachment for his friend Mr Belmour  MISS COURTENEY  confused  I a secret attachment why is it possible you can have discoveredthat is that you suspect  MISS AUTUMN  Ha ha ha no my dear your extreme reserve made me first suspect and afterwards discover  MISS COURTENEY  What have you discovered  MISS AUTUMN  That you love Mr Belmouraye you may blushThis was a secret that required all my sagacity to discover but as for his passion for you any ideot might have found that out  MISS COURTENEY  Yet does not reserve become one in my circumstances An unhappy orphan compelled by my ill fate to become a fugitive from the friend to whom I owed my past and from whom I expected my future support thus distrest perhaps censured  MISS AUTUMN  I will not hear you talk so censured you cannot be you have acted upon motives too justifiable and I hope my fortune is sufficient to keep distress far from us both  MISS COURTENEY  Generous Charlotte yet if Lady Autumn should discover me she will think it her duty to force me back to my aunt  MISS AUTUMN  Most certainly what favour can youth and beauty expect from a coquet of fifty  MISS COURTENEY  Indeed my dear you make too free with the foibles of your father's widow but you ought to remember that if she loves admiration at fifty it is because she was a coquet at fifteen  MISS AUTUMN  That is true I protest I tremble at the idea of being one day what my stepmother is at present Oh heavens in the midst of wrinkles and grey hairs to dream of gentle languishments vows ardorsbut there is some comfort yet fifty and I are at an immense distance  MISS COURTENEY  Do not cheat yourself my dear with that thought young though you are you will be old whatever advances with such rapidity cannot be accounted far distant  MISS AUTUMN  Well I am determined to grow grave in time dear Harriet give me a lesson every day till you have compleated my reformationbut is not that Freeman and Belmour yonder They are certainly come in search of us come hither Harrietyou  who pronounced the rebel had escaped memark that pensive air those folded armsWell my sage monitress of eighteen will you pretend to assert that he is not thinking on me Now can I not for my life resist my inclination to teaze him a littleDo dear girl indulge me this once I promise you I will not be very cruelNay you shall prescribe the utmost limits of my triumph and when you think I am carrying it too far only pull me by the sleeve and I will instantly recollect myself  MISS COURTENEY  Ha ha ha I see your reformation is begun  SCENE III  Enter  Lord Clairville  and  Courteney  COURTENEY  Your servant ladies we have been looking for you this half hour  MISS AUTUMN  One would think you expected to find us like daisies springing up under your steps I observed your eyes bent constantly on the ground  CLAIRVILLE  My friend is a little thoughtful today  MISS AUTUMN  aside to Miss  Courteney  Mark that Harriet he has certainly escaped me do you not think so    To  Courteney  That is your melancholy is it not so Mr Freeman Well does not this prove what I have often told you there is not the least sympathy in our minds you are always sad when I am gay but I have a mind to be complaisant for once and will permit you to chuse the humour I shall be of during the next half hour  COURTENEY  carelessly bowing  Pardon me Madam you must chuse for yourself you are so agreeable in whatever humour you assume that it is impossible for me to give the preference to any Your smiles and frowns become you in my opinion so equally that I am charmed alike whether you smile or frown  MISS AUTUMN  aside a little disconcerted  Indeed so indifferent  MISS COURTENEY  aside to her  I think I must pull  him  by the sleeve my dear  MISS AUTUMN  Mr Bellmour my mamma sent you a card this morning you and your friend dine with us I hope  CLAIRVILLE  We will certainly wait on you ladies  COURTENEY  It must be a farewell visit then ladies for we set out for Paris tomorrow  Here  Clairville  and Miss  Courteney  talk apart  MISS AUTUMN  Going and so unconcerned too  aside  This resolution is very sudden Sir To be sure Paris is a charming place you are vastly in the right to go Miss D'Arcy my dear we have but just time to dress for dinner  CLAIRVILLE  We will wait on you home ladies  MISS AUTUMN  drawing away her hand from  Courteney  who offers to lead her  No ceremony Sir I can walk without assistance  COURTENEY  Piqued by heaven this is better than I expected  Exeunt  Courteney Clairville  Miss  Autumn  and Miss  Courteney  SCENE IV  Enter Lady  Autumn  and her woman at the other side  LADY AUTUMN  There they are but I shall not join them these girls are never weary of walking  SIMPLE  They are young Madam  LADY AUTUMN  Young well I suppose you do not think me old and yet I hate walking it is a robust exercise  SIMPLE  To be sure there can be no pleasure in walking when one has the  rheumatism  so bad as your Ladyship has  LADY AUTUMN  The rheumatism who told you I had the rheumatism What because I was laid up with a sprain which I got by running rather too giddily indeed after my squirrel it passed for the rheumatism  SIMPLE  I am sure Madam the doctors called it so  LADY AUTUMN  The doctors were blockheads thenNot return to join me  aside and looking about  Simple observe whether Mr Freeman be coming back  SIMPLE  No indeed Madam he is walking on towards the house with the young ladies  LADY AUTUMN  aside  It is certainly so he is vexed I treated him with too much rigour last night rigour was always my fault I cannot help it  sighs  SIMPLE  Bless me I hope your Ladyship is not taken ill  LADY AUTUMN  Ill no and yet one cannot be very well when one is the cause of so much pain to others  SIMPLE  Madam  LADY AUTUMN  It does not signify there is no living without a confidantSimple you have been in my service but a short time but I have a notion that you are very discreet  SIMPLE  curtseying  Indeed I am Madam  LADY AUTUMN  Aye I know you are I am seldom mistaken in my judgement of people to shew you then that I think you very discreet I am resolved to make you my confidant  SIMPLE  Confidant I thank you Madam but butI had rather keep the place I was hired for Madam  LADY AUTUMN  Yes I am determined to deposite all my secrets in your breastKnow then Simple that there is a young man who seemsbut why do I say seemswho is desperatelywhat shall I call it who really languishes with an unconquerable invincible hopeless fatal dying passion forfor meis not this a sad thing  SIMPLE  Yes indeed Madam it is a very strange thing  LADY AUTUMN  A strange thing I say is it not a sad thing  SIMPLE  To be sure it is a sad thing Madam and I am very sorry for it  LADY AUTUMN  Poor Freeman I am sorry toobut there was a kind of fatality in itI never told you Simple the manner of our first acquaintance  SIMPLE  No Madam  LADY AUTUMN  One morning when I was sauntering in the forest habited in a loose white sack with my walkingcrook in my handpoor Lord Autumn used to say I looked like a nymph in this dressI found myself fatigued and was obliged to rest under a treeHere I sat or rather reclined in a pensive attitude when I was roused by the sight of a monstrous snake that had fastened on my arm  SIMPLE  Lord bless me Madam what did you do  LADY AUTUMN  DoI screamed so loud that two young gentlemen who were walking at a little distance came running to meboth were eager to assist me but Mr Freeman's assiduity was so animated so languishingsosoin short the blow was struck I perceived immediately that I had made a violent impression  SIMPLE  But pray Madam if I may be so bold how did your Ladyship get rid of the snake  LADY AUTUMN  The snakeO I was mistaken it was only a caterpillar which my fears had magnified into a snake Mr Freeman then offered me his hand to lead me home but it was with such a timid aspectSince that day his friend Belmour and he have been constant visitors at my house and although his passion has been continually increasing yet he has concealed it so carefully that no person in the family has discovered it but myself  SIMPLE  I'll answer for it Madam nobody dreams of any such thingBut I wonder the gentleman has not broke his mind to your Ladyship  LADY AUTUMN  No he has ever been silent awfully silent as to that pointsuch is his extreme timidity Timidity Simple ever accompanies a violent passion for flames as the poet says burn highest when they tremble most  SIMPLE    looking out    I vow Madam here is Mr Freeman coming all alone Sure he intends to break his mind now  LADY AUTUMN  It is he indeedThis can never be chance he has certainly followed me hither His passion has at length got the better of his timidity and he is resolved to declare himself I must not be too reservedI must not kill his hopeSimple observe his looks when he accosts me  Enter  Courteney  COURTENEY  Your Ladyship's most humble servant I did not expect to meet you here Madam  LADY AUTUMN  No you had a mind for a solitary walk then  COURTENEY  No indeed Madam I have been walking all the morning I left Mr Belmour with the young ladies to take leave for we set out for Paris tomorrow  LADY AUTUMN  How do you leave us tomorrowIs this to try me    aside    Positively Mr Freeman you must not go  COURTENEY  Indeed Madam I must there is an absolute necessity for it  LADY AUTUMN  Indeed but there is no absolute necessity for it Do you think I have so little penetration as not to have discovered the cause of this sudden resolution  COURTENEY  So she means my Lord's passion for Miss D'Arcy If I could but draw some intelligence from her concerning this young woman it might be of use    aside    LADY AUTUMN  Now is he considering with himself whether he may venture to make a discovery of his passion I protest I am all in a slutter He wants courage    aside    Mr Freeman have I guessed truly as to the cause of your sudden departure  COURTENEY  I cannot answer that question till I know what it is your Ladyship guesses  LADY AUTUMN    Looking down upon her fan affectedly    Nay now Mr Freemanthis is too much you throw me into the greatest confusion imaginableTo be sure I have guesseda passion so very obviousbut methinks it would better become you to explain yourself  COURTENEY  Why Madam I confess you have guessed truly my friend's passion is indeed pretty obvious but there are certain reasons which make it highly improper for him to indulge it  LADY AUTUMN  His friend's passion prettily turnedHow cautious how diffident    aside    Well Sir this you may assure your friend of however that to  my  certain knowledge he need not despair  COURTENEY  So she favours this business I find  aside  LADY AUTUMN  Well Sir do you still hold your resolution of leaving us  COURTENEY  Your Ladyship may easily imagine that I am somewhat interested in this affair  LADY AUTUMN  Yes yes I can very easily imagine that  COURTENEY  I should be glad therefore to know  COURTENEY  Positively you shall know no more nowYou men are so importunateBut suppose now I should  give you an opportunity of talking to me upon this affair  COURTENEY  I should be greatly obliged to you Madam  LADY AUTUMN  He might have thrown a little more rapture into his answer    aside    Well I shall be alone in the drawingroom after dinnerandBut this looks so like an assignation that I have a good mind to withdraw my promise  COURTENEY  Assignation how could that come into her head    aside    No no Madam depend upon it I will hold you to your promise  LADY AUTUMN  Adieu then till dinner Simple do you hear lay out my pink and whiteI shall dress immediately  Exeunt Lady  Autumn  and  Simple  COURTENEY    alone    What a piece of affectation But if she has not entered heartily into the interest of this Miss D'Arcy with whom my pupil is madly in love I shall be able to discover her character and circumstances and must take my measures accordingly  Exit  Courteney  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE  a drawingroom in Lady  Autumn's  house  Enter  Courteney  as from dinner  COURTENEY  IF I do not hit upon some method to rescue Lord Clairville he is undone I observed him all dinnertimehis attachment to this young creature is amazing  Enter Lord  Clairville  CLAIRVILLE  Courteney I wished to speak a word to you in private I have been thinking all day on this journey to Paris  COURTENEY  Well my Lord  CLAIRVILLE  I find I cannot resolve to go  COURTENEY  I suspected as much  CLAIRVILLE  Without first seeing my father  COURTENEY  There you are perfectly right my Lord you intend to wait on him tomorrow I suppose  CLAIRVILLE  Not so neither I would prepare him firstI intend to write to him to explain my reasons for returning before I had received his orders and to assure him that I cannot think of marrying Lady Anne and that I wait his answer here I will just step to my lodgings and write my letter and return immediately  Exit  Clairville  COURTENEY  alone  My Lord has a very contented air he has certainly brought his mistress to terms but what those terms are I must endeavour to find out This girl I fear will draw him into some rash engagement I can form no judgement of her character and designs she is so reserved Ha here she comesI will try to found her and for once in order to preserve my pupil I will assume a language foreign to my heart  Enter Miss  Courteney  MISS COURTENEY  Mr Freeman is it certain that you set out for Paris tomorrow  COURTENEY  If not tomorrow Madam most certainly the next day  MISS COURTENEY  I have a relation in Paris whom I have not heard from for several weeksit is of great importance to me to have a letter safely conveyed to his handswill you execute this little commission for me  COURTENEY  Receiving the letter which he puts into his pocket book  With pleasure Madam but the honour you do me in employing me upon this occasion will be envied by my friend  MISS COURTENEY  Mr Belmour tells me he does not go with you  COURTENEY  He once resolved otherwise and his affairs required it should be so but I who know how difficult it is to be in love and to be wise am not surprized that he has changed his mind  MISS COURTENEY    in confusion    This is an affair which I do not pretend to judge of Will you walk into the next room the coffee is brought in  going  COURTENEY    detaining her    Nay but this is an affair which concerns you Madam more than any other personyou must indeed you must permit me to plead for my friend I know the sincerity and ardor of his passion for you  MISS COURTENEY  Hold Mr Freemanam I to think you serious  COURTENEY  You wrong yourself and me by supposing I would jest upon so delicate a subject  MISS COURTENEY  It is strange methinks that you should encourage him in the liking you say he has entertained for me his fortunes seem to be high I am poor and dependantdo you think his parents will approve of so unequal match  COURTENEY  What have parents to do with a tender engagement  MISS COURTENEY  Ha  COURTENEY  His I believe have destined his hand to another but his heart I am sure will always be yours  MISS COURTENEY  aside in great confusion  What can he mean  COURTENEY  My friend adores you Madam he has the power and the will to make you happyto place you in affluence and splendorit is true that circumscribed by a father's authority he cannot offer you his handbut  MISS COURTENEY  No more Sirthis insult is too plain  turns and weeps  Oh why am I thus weak indignation scorn contempt would better become me  COURTENEY  She is strangely moved in tears too her beautiful disorder affects mesurely I have been to blame  MISS COURTENEY  endeavouring to seem composed  I will not ask you Sir what you have observed in my behaviour which could encourage you to treat me thus freelyYou no doubt act upon principle and it is not surprizing that persons who hold riches to be the greatest good should think they are more than an equivalent for virtue  COURTENEY  Charming creature  aside  MISS COURTENEY  You boast your friend's rank and affluence it belongs indeed to the great to be licentious with impunity My humbler fate makes other maxims safer I have been taught to think poverty a less evil than dishonour and to aspire to that distinction only which is attainable by all the distinction due to virtue  COURTENEY  How could I harbour a profane thought of such a woman    aside    I have offended so greatly Madam that I hardly dare solicit much less hope for pardon but if you knew  MISS COURTENEY  No apologies Sir to me your offence is general and proceeds from the bad opinion you have formed of my sex yet to judge of all from an acquaintance perhaps with the worst is an error which a man of sense ought surely to have avoided It is sinning against conviction for whatever libertines pretend the contempt they feel for those they have seduced is a proof of that secret homage which all men pay to virtue  COURTENEY  I am ashamed and confounded at what has past yet permit me  MISS COURTENEY  No more Sir we must be strangers for the future therefore return the letter I gave you I shall find a fitter way of conveying it  COURTENEY  Do not Madam deprive me of an opportunity of doing yon this small service  MISS COURTENEY  with some emotion  No Sir nothat letter would introduce you to the friendship of a man whose sentiments and conduct are very different from yoursAlas what would his generous heart suffer were he to know the insult his sister has been subjected to this day  turns and weeps  COURTENEY  looking earnestly at her  Her brother good heaven should it be possible    takes out the letter and reads the direction    Ha "To Mr Courteney"her wellknown hand tooconfusion have I then been all this time practising on the virtue of my sister  MISS COURTENEY  turning towards him  Give me the letter Sir  COURTENEY  The letter belongs to me for oh my dear Harriet my amiable my virtuous sister II am CourteneyI am your your brother  MISS COURTENEY  Is it possible  COURTENEY  I am nay shrink not from my embraceand yet your doubts are natural you were so young when we parted it is impossible you should recollect my featuresBut I have tokens that may convince you see here your mother's picture this bracelet of her hair her last dear gift  MISS COURTENEY  You areyou are my brother but why have you concealed yourself so long and whywhy this severe trial of your sister  COURTENEY  My dear Harriet I must take shame to myself I knew you not under a borrowed name and in a  place where I so little expected to meet youI shall never think on what has passed without the deepest confusion and remorse Anxious to preserve my pupil from offending his father by an unequal marriage and suspicious of your real character I have insulted innocence and Heaven to punish me has turned that insult on my sister  MISS COURTENEY  Oh that my brother may be taught by this adventure never more to insult distress and innocence and to consider every virtuous unprotected young woman as a sister Alas I was afraid my slight from my aunt had exposed me to your suspicions  COURTENEY  I know your motives they free you from all blame  MISS COURTENEY  But why did you assume the name of Freeman  COURTENEY  I believe you already guess that the young gentleman you see with me is the Earl of Belmont's son whom I have accompanied in his travels his father having provided a match for him he prevailed upon me to come with him privately to England in order to see his intended bride without being known by her  MISS COURTENEY  His intended bride  COURTENEY  Yes his intended bridebut why this emotion sister You love Mr Belmourah this is what I fearbut remember my dear Harriet that Mr Belmour is Lord Clairville and never can be yours and were he weak enough to offer you his hand I am bound in honour to prevent it He was committed  to my care by my benefactor and my friend and should I encourage his passion for you it would be such a scandalous breach of trust as would sink me below the meanest of mankind By Heaven I would rather lose my life than incur the infamy of having betrayed my pupil into a clandestine marriage with my sister  MISS COURTENEY  Be calm brother and place some confidence in me you will find that I deserve it  COURTENEY  'Tis well then promise me to conceal your name and family still from Lord Clairville if he knows I am your brother he will possibly be weak enough to expect my concurrence with his designs and my fixed resolution to oppose them may occasion a breach between us  MISS COURTENEY  Heaven forbid  COURTENEY  Nor would I have Miss Autumn know me yet by any other name than Freeman  MISS COURTENEY  And is this necessary  COURTENEY  I am apprehensive from her mistaken kindness for you that she will certainly acquaint Lord Clairville with the truth  MISS COURTENEY  Well I will be entirely governed by you  COURTENEY  Then my dear Harriet you must resolve to go with me tomorrow to your aunt I am assured that she is very desirous of being reconciled to you  and you cannot with any propriety stay here where Lord Clairville may have such easy access to you  MISS COURTENEY  To return to my aunt is the hardest injunction you have laid upon me yet but even in this you shall be obeyed  COURTENEY  Tomorrow morning early a postchaise shall be ready for you I will join you on the road and conduct you to EssexBut how is this Harriet You are in tearsI expected more firmness from you  MISS COURTENEY  I am to blamebut  COURTENEY  Here is somebody coming

Lady Autumn  LADY AUTUMN  Waiting in expectation of my coming So it should be a passionate lover will always prevent the hour  Aside  COURTENEY  without seeing her  If I can but avoid a discovery till I have placed her out of his reach my honour will be safe  LADY AUTUMN  Lost in tender contemplation  Aside  Mr Freeman    advancing    COURTENEY  I ask your Ladyship's pardon I did not see you  LADY AUTUMN  No well here I am according to my promise but you must not impute this condescensionyou must not presume upon it  COURTENEY  Presume Madam  LADY AUTUMN  Nay positively you shall not gaze upon me thusI shall blush ten times more if you do  COURTENEY  Gaze upon you Madam  LADY AUTUMN  How his respect for me embarrasses him  aside  You were talking to me this morning of your friend's passion Mr Freeman you remember the phraseyour  friend's  passionneed I tell you that I am very favourably disposed to hear all you have to say upon that subject  COURTENEY  My friend's passion I must put that notion out of her head    aside    Oh dear Madam I was only jesting  LADY AUTUMN  How Sir  COURTENEY  Raillery I do assure your Ladyship  LADY AUTUMN  I am confounded  COURTENEY  You were certainly mistaken Madam if you looked upon my friend's attachment in any other light than meer gallantry  LADY AUTUMN  This is strange yet he owns an attachment that is something however    aside    So then I am to suppose that  COURTENEY  Nothing more than such homage as the young and beautiful will always claim from our sex  LADY AUTUMN  When you speak of beauty there I am sure you flatter and yet poor Lord Autumn used to think but Lord Autumn perhaps was singular in his opinion  COURTENEY  What does she mean  Aside  Enter  Footman  FOOTMAN  Madam Miss Autumn sends to acquaint your Ladyship that the coffee is upon the table  LADY AUTUMN  What an unseasonable interruption    aside    Mr Freeman I do not think you have any great inclination for coffee  COURTENEY  Indeed I have Madam I will attend your Ladyship    offering his hand    LADY AUTUMN  I protest he trembles all this inconsistency is nothing but extreme respect  aside  Come Sir we will talk of this affair another time  Exeunt

can have occasioned this sudden resolution Sure Lady Autumn has not affronted herBetty  BETTY  Madam  MISS AUTUMN  Have you observed any coldness lately between Lady Autumn and Miss D'ArcyShe talks of leaving me tomorrow I am afraid she has taken some disgust  BETTY  O dear Ma'am you are quite mistaken Miss D'Arcy has other thoughts in her head  MISS AUTUMN  Other thoughts What do you mean  BETTY  Lord Ma'am I mean nothing not I but I know  MISS AUTUMN  What do you know  BETTY  Nay Ma'am I know nothing not Ibut I have seen something and I have been told something  MISS AUTUMN  Then pray say

tempt you to betray it I assure youGo and tell Miss D'Arcy that I wish to speak with her here  BETTY  Depend upon it Ma'am Miss D'Arcy will confess nothing she has carried this matter too closely  MISS AUTUMN  You would fain disclose this secret I perceive but I will not gratify my curiosity at the expence of your fidelityGo and deliver my message  BETTY  Nay Ma'am since you will have itthough I am sure I never thought to have told  MISS AUTUMN  Be gone impertinent I will not hear you  BETTY  Nay Ma'am what I know is no great matter it is only that Mr Freeman is in love with Miss D'Arcy  MISS AUTUMN  What is that you say Come backMr Freeman in love with Miss D'Arcy impossible  BETTY  Oh dear Ma'am why impossible Miss D'Arcy is a fine young lady and to be sure Mr Freeman doats upon her

AUTUMN  That is truebut this is a secret which ought not to be concealed You know Miss D'Arcy is my friendshe may be taking some rash stepIt is fit I should enquire into this matterSo Mr Freeman is  her  lover then  sighs  BETTY  Yes Ma'am I am sure he is for you must know Ma'am that they met here in this very room today I saw them with my own eyesI was passing by the door when they were in earnest discourseNow I abhor listening Ma'amI am above itso I stood still and shut the door halfway that they might not see me but I could scarcely hear a word they saidthey talked so low At last I saw Miss D'Arcy burst into tears and presently afterwards Mr Freeman threw his arms about her neck and kissed her  MISS AUTUMN  Kissed her and did she suffer that  BETTY  Yes indeed did she Ma'am and kissed him again very cordially too  MISS AUTUMN  Amazement Her motive for leaving me is now too plain  BETTY  To be sure Ma'am Why Ma'am Mr Freeman is to go along with her  MISS AUTUMN  How do you know that  BETTY  Why Ma'am you must know that Mr William Mr Freeman's servanthis gentleman I should say for he is above wearing a livery  MISS AUTUMN  What is that to the purpose Go on  BETTY  I hope you will excuse me Ma'ambut Mr William has for some days made his addresses to me upon honourable terms  MISS AUTUMN  Absurd creature What then  BETTY  He told me Ma'am under a promise of secresy that his master was certainly going to steal a marriage with Miss D'Arcy for that he had ordered him to hire a postchaise for her that he was to attend her as far as London and Mr Freeman was to join them there but where they were to proceed afterwards he did not know  MISS AUTUMN  It is certainly soWhat a dupe have I been all this timeTreacherous Harriet  BETTY  If I had thought this news would have discomposed you so much Ma'am I would not have told you  MISS AUTUMN  Discomposed What is it to me whom Mr Freeman marriesLeave me  Exit  Betty  MISS AUTUMN    alone    Discomposedyes I feel it but too sensibly Ungrateful Harriet But why do I complain of her Have I not always affected to despise this man laughed at and raillied him continually He is coming Let me laugh and railly still Let me conceal my weakness at least It will not be I cannot look at him without betraying myself  going  Enter  Courteney  COURTENEY  Miss Autumn you are wanted at the quadrilletable  MISS AUTUMN  I shall not play tonight Sir  Exit  COURTENEY  That was spoke in a peevish toneI am sure her eyes seemed full of tears too Can that impenetrable heart have feelings Charming creature She only wants a little sensibility to make her irresistible  Enter Lord  Clairville  CLAIRVILLE  I am in no humour to play this eveningdear Courteney take my place  COURTENEY  That you may have an opportunity of entertaining Miss D'ArcyIs it not so my Lord  CLAIRVILLE  I confess it is But why must I find you eternally in my way What is it you apprehend  COURTENEY  Great inconveniences from this attachment my Lord and I think it my duty to oppose it  CLAIRVILLE  I must dissemble with him    aside    What do you imagine I am weak enough to be honourably in love with this girl  COURTENEY  Ha and do you own my Lord you have dishonourable designs upon this girl as you call her  CLAIRVILLE  Why if I had what then  COURTENEY  What then confusion dishonourable designs uponuponthis is too much my Lord Let us talk no more upon this subject  CLAIRVILLE  This is astonishing By Heaven his colour changes what can this mean  aside  COURTENEY  My Lord I must advise nay I intreat you to think no more of Miss D'Arcy you will find insuperable difficulties in your way Hereafter I will explain myself more fully  bows and exit  CLAIRVILLE  Stay Courteney I insist upon your explaining yourself nowgonewhat am I to think of this he loves her himself perhapswhat then does he expect I should resign her to him has he been base enoughno that is not possible  Enter Miss  Courteney  MISS COURTENEY  I thought Mr Freeman had been with you Sir  CLAIRVILLE  Mr Freeman Madam it was Mr Freeman then you wished to see  MISS COURTENEY  I have a little business with him  CLAIRVILLE  Business with Mr Freeman Madam how long has Mr Freeman been honoured with your confidence  MISS COURTENEY  I always esteemed Mr Freeman Sir  CLAIRVILLE  Well Madam he is worthy of your esteem  MISS COURTENEY  He seems chagrined at something    aside    Will you not join the company Sir in the next room  CLAIRVILLE  Her looks are colder than usual but I will clear up all my doubts at once    aside    Indulge me with a few moments Madam while I intreat your pardon for having concealed my real name and circumstances from you I am now at liberty to declare myself since my father by this time knows my resolution never to marry the lady he designed for me  MISS COURTENEY  What would he say  aside  CLAIRVILLE  My name is not Belmour it is Clairville I am son to the Earl of Belmont and heir to his title and estate but title and estate with you I am sure will weigh nothing if the man is unworthy But if as Belmour I have been so fortunate as to  gain your esteem you will not refuse your hand to Clairville  MISS COURTENEY  Generous youth oh my hard fate  aside  CLAIRVILLE  You turn from me you answer me not Was it then a vain hope I flattered myself with when I believed I was not disagreeable to you  MISS COURTEVEY  Oh brother what a task have you imposed upon me  aside  CLAIRVILLE  Keep me not dear Miss D'Arcy in this cruel suspencebut why do I say suspenceyour silence speaks plainly enoughyour affections are bestowed upon another  MISS COURTENEY  Oh think not so my Lord my heart  CLAIRVILLE  Go on Madam I conjure you  MISS COURTENEY  Is sensible to your worth but  CLAIRVILLE  Finish the harsh sentence Madam you love another  MISS COURTENEY  Love another oh heavens  aside  What can I say my Lord the honour you do me demands my most grateful acknowledgements but there are obstacles  CLAIRVILLE  My fatherhe will consent perhapsif not he will forgive  MISS COURTENEY  I understand you my Lord No this can never bethere are difficulties which cannot be surmountedYet do not suppose me ungrateful insensible ofwhat am I going to sayThink of me no more my Lord and obey the commands of your father  Exit Miss  Courteney  CLAIRVILLE  Think of her no moredifficulties that never can be surmountedCourteney said the very same wordsI fear it is too true that they love each other Their secret conferences the simularity of their conduct their mutual confusion and reserve all contribute to heighten my suspicions Distraction this double jealousy of the objects both of my friendship and my love is intolerableCan then CourteneyI cannot bear these doubtsI must and will be satisfied  Exit  Enter Lady  Autumn  and  Simple  LADY AUTUMN  Did Betty tell you this  SIMPLE  Yes indeed Madam  LADY AUTUMN  It cannot beI will not believe itI know I am the object of his secret affection  SIMPLE  I would lay ever so much your Ladyship is mistaken  LADY AUTUMN  Simple I begin to think you have not so much understanding as I once imagined you had  SIMPLE  Here is Mr Belmour Madam pray ask him I dare say he knows all his secrets  Enter  Clairville  LADY AUTUMN  Leave me    exit  Simple  Mr Belmour where have you been this half hour  CLAIRVILLE  with impatience  Is Mr Freeman gone home Madam  LADY AUTUMN  No certainly he sups here tonight and you too I hopeWe will join him in the garden he is therebut first Mr Belmour I would ask you a questiondo you suspect your friend to be in love  CLAIRVILLE  Ha this may lead to a discovery    aside    I do Madam  LADY AUTUMN  You dowell that is candidly said And so do I    laughs    Poor Freemanyes he is in love a person of the least discernment in the world might have perceived his passion  CLAIRVILLE  Then your Ladyship has perceived it  LADY AUTUMN  His sighs his languishments his tender assiduityDo you imagine all this could escape observation  CLAIRVILLE  Yet it did minehow have I been deceived  aside  LADY AUTUMN  But has he not trusted you with the secret  CLAIRVILLE  Me Madam was it likely he would own his passion to me  LADY AUTUMN  I think so but you have found it out however and I doubt not can guess the object  CLAIRVILLE  sighing  Yes Madam I believe I canbut your Ladyship knows I am sure  LADY AUTUMN  I vow this is very provokingknowyes certainly I knowthat is I can guessbut sure you would not be so unpolite as to oblige me to name her  CLAIRVILLE  Well Madam I will name her then but your Ladyship must condescend  LADY AUTUMN  Condescendbless me you are leading me very far methinksI will not hear another word upon this subject you are making conditions for your friend I findbut come tell me what would you have me condescend to  CLAIRVILLE  When I have named the lady to tell me if I have guessed truly  LADY AUTUMN  Well I protest this is a very modest request and to you would have me ownbut name her name her  CLAIRVILLE  Miss D'Arcy  LADY AUTUMN  looking disappointed  Miss D'Arcy Is this your discernment You never was more mistaken in your life  CLAIRVILLE  Am I mistaken Madam  LADY AUTUMN  Certainly but I know upon what grounds Miss D'Arcy has surprized us all with a sudden resolution to go into the country tomorrow and Miss Autumn's tattling woman has told us that it is at Mr Freeman's instigation that he has provided a postchaise for her and is to conduct her himself She pretends to know this from his own servantidle stuffbut we will railly him upon it  CLAIRVILLE  So it is all out persidious Courteney  Aside  LADY AUTUMN  Well what do you think of this absurd report  CLAIRVILLE  That it may possibly be true Madam for you say Miss D'Arcy is to leave you tomorrow  LADY AUTUMN  Yes but not to steal a marriage with Mr Freeman Ha ha ha how people may be deceived Do you understand the language of the eyes Mr Belmour  CLAIRVILLE  The language of the eyes Madam  LADY AUTUMN  If you did you would not have been so much mistaken with regard to your friend's attachment your suspicions would have fallen somewhere else I assure youCome shall we take the air in the garden The sun is almost set  LORD CLAIRVILLE  Excuse me Madam I have a little private business with Mr Freeman  LADY AUTUMN  You will find him in the garden I will bring you to him  CLAIRVILLE  I will follow you Madam    Exeunt Lady  Autumn  and  Simple  Perfidious Courtney it is too plain he has supplanted me basely supplanted me and the story he has told me of his sister was invented to excuse his sudden absence Is this the friend who possessed more than a brother's part of my affections I have been his dupe his bubble I will find him instantly acquaint him with my detection of his perfidy and demand satisfaction  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  A garden  Enter  Courteney  and Miss  Courteney  talking  COURTENEY  YES my dear sister I agree with you that Lord Clairville has acted with great delicacy and this frank offer of his hand is a proof that his esteem of you is equal to his lovebut do not carry your gratitude too far do not encourage sentiments that must be suppressed the Earl of Belmont will never consent to your marriageI am bound by honour to prevent itendeavour then to banish him from your thoughts  MISS COURTENEY  To banish him from my thoughts isperhaps not in my power but never to be his without your approbation I can and do promise because I am convinced you ought to act as you do  COURTENEY  And you hold to your resolution of going tomorrow  MISS COURTENEY  I do  COURTENEY  How does this generous selfdenial endear you to me Believe me my dear Harriet it wrings my soul to be obliged thus to oppose your happiness were any thing less than my honour at stake but you are just enough to perceive the reasonableness of my conduct  MISS COURTENEY  No more I beg you on this subjectbut tell me when you will permit me to regain the confidence of my friend  COURTENEY  Whom do you mean  MISS COURTENEY  Miss Autumnmy sudden resolution to leave her tomorrow without being able to give her a satisfactory reason for it and your design of conducting me yourself having by some means or other come to her knowledge she suspects you are my lover and her resentment  COURTENEY  Resentment does the suspicion of my being your lover give her any concern  MISS COURTENEY  I am to blame I have betrayed my friend's secret without being sure of his sentiments for her  Aside  COURTENEY  But tell me dear Harriet is it possible that Miss Autumn can be jealous  MISS COURTENEY  Jealous what an inference has your vanity drawn Miss Courteney thinks I have entered into some engagements with you and considers my not having communicated them to her as a breach of our friendship  COURTENEY  confused  Yes to be surethat is very naturalthen she is angrybut as you say she considers it as a breach of friendshipthat indeed accounts for her  anger But tell me Harriet are Miss Autumn's affections wholly disengaged is there not one happy man in the world who has been able to touch her heart  MISS COURTENEY  Perhaps I may not tell you that but I will tell you whose heart she has touched  COURTENEY  That is no great matterwhose  MISS COURTENEY  Yours brother  COURTENEY  You may be mistaken  MISS COURTENEY  Am I mistaken  COURTENEY  Nonow laugh if you willbut do not tell your friend I would not swell her triumph and be numbered in the list of her discarded admirers  MISS COURTENEY  There is no danger of that I believe  COURTENEY  But what proofs have you of her partiality for me  MISS COURTENEY  The strongest in one of her temper she affects to hate you  COURTENEY  That is a good sign I confess  MISS COURTENEY  And me she has ceased to love now that she suspects me to be her rival I can perceive her heart is torn with jealousy yet she affects her usual gaiety and unconcernbut indifference is of all  dispositions of the mind the hardest to feign and she is too little practised in dissimulation to feign it wellI wish it were consistent with your plan to own our secret  COURTENEY  Do not press me on this subjectmy situation is already sufficiently perplexingShould Lord Clairville suspect you are my sisterbut I think I see him in the next walkLeave me dear Harriet I would not have him find us alone  Exit Miss  Courteney  Enter Lord  Clairville  CLAIRVILLE  It was sheThey separated at my approach Both both are perfidious    aside    COURTENEY  My Lord you seem chagrined at something What is the matter  CLAIRVILLE  Ask your own heartHave you dealt ingenuously with me in regard to the lady who parted from you this moment  COURTENEY    hesitating    My Lord  CLAIRVILLE  I will spare you any further dissimulation Sir I know all  COURTENEY  I am sorry for it my Lord because it convinces me of my sister's imprudenceShe has broke her word with me weak girl    aside    CLAIRVILLE  Your sister's imprudenceYes that was one of your artifices to furnish you with an excuse for quitting mefalse false Courteney  COURTENEY  Forbear these unjust reproaches my LordBy Heaven till this day I knew not that my sister  CLAIRVILLE  No more of your evasions SirThe story you told me of your sister may or may not be true it matters not though it is most likely it was feigned to cover your designs upon Miss D'Arcy  COURTENEY  He knows her not yet I find she has kept her promisemy generous sister    aside    CLAIRVILLE  You knew my passion for Miss D'ArcyConfiding in your friendship my unsuspecting heart trusted you without reserve and while you were treacherously supplanting me in her affections I was weak enough to believe that your eagerness of opposition was the effect of a prudential regard to my interest  COURTENEY  And so it wasso it is still  CLAIRVILLE  Villain 'tis false  COURTENEY  Ha VillainHe thinks I have wronged him But then this outrageVillain 'tis too much  CLAIRVILLE  Yes Villain I repeat the term and will support my assertion Lead where you please I will follow you  COURTENEY    after a pause    No my Lord I will neither lead nor follow you at present You think I am your rivalthink so stillAfter the treatment I have received from you it would be mean to undeceive you  CLAIRVILLE  Against such plain such convincing circumstances what can you offer in your justification  COURTENEY  NothingI will offer nothingand yet I could undeceive you with a single wordbut you do not deserve this condescension my Lordyou who have condemned your friend unheardwho have suffered a light illgrounded suspicion to rob him of the merit of many years faithful attachment injured insulted and branded him with the name of Villainwhile hebut no moreHereafter you will know the motives upon which I have actedthen when shame and remorse for your offence have intitled you to my forgiveness then I may think you worthy of an explanation  CLAIRVILLE  This language is very bold SirSure you forget  COURTENEY  Oh noI remember you are a Lord a title greatly inferior to that of a man of honour  CLAIRVILLE  How Sir  COURTENEY  My Lord nobility is virtue or it is nothing  CLAIRVILLE  Well grant it possible I may have wronged you by my suspicionsanswer me then one question is it true that you go with Miss D'Arcy tomorrow  COURTENEY  It is  CLAIRVILLE  You own it  COURTENEY  I doand  CLAIRVILLE  No moreI am convincedThou mean seducerBut hope not to carry it thus triumphantlyWithin this half hour meet me behind the gardenwallthere if I cannot obtain satisfaction from the man I will at least do justice on a coward  COURTENEY  Coward My Lord I'll meet you  CLAIRVILLE  'Tis wellI shall expect you  Exit  Clairville  COURTENEY    after a pause    In taking revenge a man is only even with his enemy in passing it over he is superiorthis sounds well the practice is something difficult But is Lord Clairville my enemya lover and jealous appearances strong too against me But such an outrage Villain Coward  Enter Miss  Courteney  MISS COURTENEY  Oh brother how greatly you distress me I heard high words between Lord Clairville and you he shot by me this moment with looks inflamed with ragescarce bowed to me in passingI fear you have quarreled  COURTENEY  Calm yourself dear Harriet and conside in my prudence  MISS COURTENEY  Excuse me brother but I cannot help telling you that your prudence has hitherto produced nothing but confusion by some means or other the whole family knows that I go under your conduct tomorrow  COURTENEY  This must be owing to some  imprudence  I doubt  MISS COURTENEY  Your relation to me being a secret this has raised a suspicion of my having entered into a clandestine engagement with you on this account Miss Autumn has withdrawn her friendship from me Lord Clairville despises me and you are become the object of his resentment All these inconveniences might have been prevented had you declared yourself my brother  COURTENEY  Perhaps notObliged as I am in honour to oppose Lord Clairville's passion for you had I acknowledged you to be my sister I should have exposed myself to importunities which it would have been difficult to have rejected and after all my conduct might have had the appearance of artifice  MISS COURTENEY  My heart forebodes some misfortuneWere it not better to own me now to Lord Clairville than to leave him in a mistake which draws his suspicions on you  COURTENEY  It is indeed unlucky that he should suspect me to be his rival had he been more temperate I believe I should have undeceived him but now an explanation would seem cowardice  walks aside  MISS COURTENEY    aside    Ah I perceive how it is I must and will prevent itLady Autumn this is fortunate  Enter Lady  Autumn  MISS COURTENEY  I beg of you dear Madam not to quit Mr FreemanSomething has happened  LADY AUTUMN  Whathas he explained himself to you then  MISS COURTENEY  Explained himself to me Madam I find your Ladyship knows something of the matter  LADY AUTUMN  I believe I do  MISS COURTENEY  Then Madam you see the necessity of preventing  LADY AUTUMN  I understand youLeave me with him  MISS COURTENEY  If I can but see Lord Clairville before they meet again  aside and exit hastily  LADY AUTUMN  'Tis soHe has not had courage to declare his passion to me himself and has employed her to mediate for himI think I have carried punctilio far enoughso respectful a flame deserveshe sees me and advancesMr Freeman you have chosen the most retired part of the garden to walk in These shades are a nurse for tender thoughts as the poet says  COURTENEY  My thoughts Madam  LADY AUTUMN  Come comeI have known your thoughts for some time I know you loveI know too that you are beloved  COURTENEY  And do you condescend to tell me so Madam  LADY AUTUMN  I do and yet perhaps I ought not but your respectful silence has had its weight with me I assure you  COURTENEY  And has Miss Autumn Madam consented  LADY AUTUMN  Miss Autumn though mistress of her fortune by her father's will has yet much to hope for from my favourshe will hardly presume to offer any opposition or if she should  COURTENEY  Ah Madam did you not this moment flatter me with the hope of being beloved  LADY AUTUMN  Yes you are beloved I repeat it  COURTENEY  Then surely no opposition is to be apprehendedYour consent secures my happiness Thus let me thank your Ladyship  kneels and kisses her hand  LADY AUTUMN  Oh riseThese rapturesYet methinks he scarcely touched my handwhat invincible respect    aside    Enter a Footman  FOOTMAN  Madam the Earl of Belmont is at the gate and sends to know if your Ladyship is at home  LADY AUTUMN  The Earl of Belmont I hardly know him Admit his Lordship What can this visit mean  COURTENEY  'Tis strange yet it is lucky    aside    Nothing could happen more fortunate for me Madam than my Lord Belmont's visit Whatever be the occasion of it his Lordship can acquaint you with some particulars relating to my family and character which it is necessary you should know and which will serve to shew you that I am not wholly unworthy of the honour you design me  LADY AUTUMN  I am impatient 'till I see himAdieu  Exit Lady  Autumn  Enter Miss  Courteney  MISS COURTENEY  Sure never was any thing so unfortunate Lord Clairville is not to be found  COURTENEY  My dear sister I have the most surprizing news to tell you  MISS COURTENEY  It is good news then for you look pleased  COURTENEY  Lady Autumn is the most generous woman in the world and I am the happiest of men  MISS COURTENEY  What do you mean  COURTENEY  Would you think it Your dear saucy tormenting lovely friend has owned an inclination for me to her stepmother and this paragon of stepmothers overlooking the inequality of fortune is determined to make us happy and has promised me her hand  MISS COURTENEY  You amaze me  COURTENEY  'Tis true and just at the moment when I was preparing to acquaint her with my real name Lord Belmont arrives from whom the discovery will come with more advantage  MISS COURTENEY  Lord Belmont here my fears of a quarrel are at an endI suppose I am now at liberty to convince Miss Autumn that I cannot be her rivalShe promised to join me in the garden  COURTENEY  Paint if you can your brother's transports and obtain me permission to throw myself at her feet Mean time I will attend Lord Belmont who is doubtless come hither in search of his son our little excursion will draw some reproaches from him but when he knows all I shall be justified in his opinion As for you my dear Harriet your conduct has been so generous  MISS COURTENEY  No more on this subject I intreat youI shall be impatient to know what passes between  the Earl and youYou will find me here in the garden  COURTENEY  I'll come to youAdieu  Exeunt severally  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  The drawingroom  Enter Lady  Autumn and  Lord  Belmont  LADY AUTUMN  WHAT you tell me my Lord surprises me greatly your son here in Windsor under a borrowed name and a constant visitor at my housewhat an adventure  LORD BELMONT  It is very true Madam he left Paris with his governor some weeks ago without acquainting me with their intention and as I am informed have passed the greatest part of their time hereAre there not two young gentlemen who visit your Ladyship under the names of Belmour and Freeman  LADY AUTUMN  Pray my Lord which of them is your son  LORD BELMONT  He who calls himself Belmour the other is his governor a young man of a good family but low fortunes whose father was my friend and upon that account as well as for the good qualities I observed in him I determined to take care of his fortune I placed him at the university of Leyden and when he had finished his studies sent him to travel with my son to whose care I confided himyoung as he is his merit justified my choice of him for this trust  LADY AUTUMN  No doubt of it my Lordall the world must approve of your choice Mr Freeman's merit but Freeman is not his name your Lordship says  LORD BELMONT  No Madam Courteney is his real name  LADY AUTUMN  Courteneyyour Lordship had reason to say he is of a good familyCourteney is a name that any person might be proud to own  LORD BELMONT  And he always supported the honour of it till now  LADY AUTUMN  'Till now my LordI am sorryyour Lordship must excuse mebut any imputation cast upon Mr FreemanMr Courteney I mean  LORD BELMONT  I see Madam you are prejudiced in his favour I am not surprised at itCourteney has many good qualities but to me he has shewn himself ungrateful I confided my son to his care and he has either led him into this misconduct or has concurred with him in it either way he has betrayed his trust  LADY AUTUMN  A youthful frolic perhaps love  LORD BELMONT  Aye Madam that is what I apprehendYour Ladyship must excuse me but although Miss Antumn is an accomplished young lady  LADY AUTUMN  Your Lordship is extremely mistaken Miss Autumn is not the object of Mr Courteney's vows I assure you  LORD BELMONT  Mr Courteney Madam is his own master he may offer his vows where he pleases but I persuade myself your Ladyship will not encourage my son in a clandestine address to Miss Autumn when you know that I have other views for him It was to tell you this Madam that I took the liberty to trouble you with a visit  LADY AUTUMN  I do assure you my Lord I know of no correspondence between Lord Clairville and Miss AutumnI never expected to be consulted by her upon these occasions a motherinlaw of my years cannot be supposed to have much authority over a girl of one and twenty  Enter  Simple  hastily  SIMPLE  Oh dear Madam I am in such a fright I hope your Ladyship will excuse me but here is Mr Belmour's servant who tells us that his master and Mr Freeman have quarrelled and are gone out to fight  LORD BELMONT  What can this meanquarrelledwith your leave Madambid the fellow come hither  Exit  Simple  LADY AUTUMN  It cannot be my Lord I left Mr Courteney a few minutes ago  Enter  William  WILLIAM  My old Lord here we are all blown up  aside  LORD BELMONT  Well Sir what is the meaning of the alarm you have given the family  WILLIAM  Pray my Lord pardon me I am but a servant and was obliged to obey the orders that were given me  LORD BELMONT  What orders  WILLIAM  I brought my young Lord his pistols as he commanded me and to be sure I believe some mischief is going forwards for I know my Lord and his governor have quarrelled I overheard them in the garden I was behind an hedgea challenge passed between them and my young Lord meeting me sent me to bring his case of pistols I followed my Lord unobserved and saw which way he went and some time afterwards I saw Mr Courteney taking the same path  LORD BELMONT  Bring me instantly to the place I may yet prevent their rashness  Exeunt Lord  Belmont  and  William  Enter Miss  Courteney  MISS COURTENEY  Oh Madam I thought my brother had been with you  LADY AUTUMN  Your brotherbut this is no time for explanations I'll follow Lord Belmontmy fears distract me  Exit Lady  Autumn  MISS COURTENEY  Alas what are your fears to mine Oh Charlotte  Enter Miss  Autumn  MISS AUTUMN  Well Madam your coquetry has produced fine effectstwo of the most amiable young men in the world are this moment perhaps dying by each other's hand and you the cause false woman  MISS COURTENEY  My coquetry dear Charlotte Mr Freeman  MISS AUTUMN  Name him not would I had never seen him but you how have you deceived mesuch insatiate vanity in one who pretended to be so far superior to all the little foibles of her sexwho was continually pressing her grave rebukes upon me and throwing out moral sentences at every turn awayhypocrisy at eighteenunnatural vice  MISS COURTENEY  My

we shall have some intelligence presentlyall the servants are gone after them  MISS COURTENEY  Shocking intelligence perhapsoh why have I concealed this fatal secret so long  MISS AUTUMN  Why indeed but let me not blame you I have been too rash already in my censures  MISS COURTENEY  Sure the sight of Lord Belmont but he may come too lateI cannot bear this cruel suspence any longer  going  MISS AUTUMN  stopping her  Here is somebody comingmy dear dear Harriet I give you joy your brother's safe it is him  Enter Mr  Courteney  MISS COURTENEY  My brotherthank Heavenbut oh Lord Clairville    aside    what terrors have you caused us where is your friend  COURTENEY  Be not alarmed my dear nothing has happened but the whole house is in strange confusion how came this foolish affair to be knownMiss Autumn ha she looks as if she had been weeping delightful thought her fears perhaps for me    Going up to Miss  Autumn  Will you pardon me Madam for the disingenuity I have been guilty of in appearing before you so long under a borrowed name my sister may have informed you that  MISS AUTUMN  Your sister Sir has been under too much anxiety for you to enter into explanationsmy dear  Harriet when you have chid your brother sufficiently for the fright he has put you into come and give me the history of this pretty adventure that I may know whether I ought to pardon him or not  Exit Miss  Autumn  MISS COURTENEY  Oh brother what affliction would you have spared me had you permitted me to undeceive Lord Clairville  COURTENEY  As things were situated it was not fit you should  MISS COURTENEY  But have you met  COURTENEY  Yes I met him I thought I could not in honour avoid it  MISS COURTENEY  Oh Heavens  COURTENEY  Be calm and hear the event he brought pistols and insisted upon my taking one he then bid me fire I refused saying that as I was resolved he should in every point be the aggressor he should fire first he did and missed me and on my soul I believe designedly for by the changes in his countenance I could perceive that grief and not anger was then the predominant passion in his mindmy turn was next I fired my pistol in the air then calmly told him that his father was here and that I would explain myself in his presence he spoke not a word but bowed and left me and we took different paths to the housebut tell me dear Harriet does Miss Autumn seem to know her mother's favourable intentions has she acknowledged any thing to you  MISS COURTENEY  I have seen her but for a few moments since you left me and neither of us was then in a humour to enter upon a discourse of that kind but now that she knows who you are she will certainly have no reserves to me Adieu I am going to her  Exit Miss  Courteney  COURTENEY    alone    Lady Autumn's generosity is so surprizing that it looks more like caprice than a design taken up upon reflection I don't know what to make of it  Enter Lord  Belmont  LORD BELMONT  So Sir you are here I have been in search of you where is my son How has your  honourable  rencounter ended  COURTENEY  Not  dis  honourably my Lord for either of us Lord Clairville will be here this moment he will do me the justice to acknowledge that this affair was forced upon me  LORD BELMONT  Ungrateful youth and dare you own to me too dare you own a quarrel with my son  COURTENEY  My Lord I can no more suffer an injury than I dare do one  LORD BELMONT  This is the language of conscious worth and but ill becomes a man who has so basely betrayed the trust that was reposed in him  COURTENEY  Basely betrayed my trust my Lord  LORD BELMONT  Yes Sir basely  COURTENEY  This reproach this unjust reproach my Lord but you have been my benefactor I know how much that sacred title claims from merail on my Lord you shall never force me to be ungrateful  Enter  Clairville  CLAIRVILLE  My father how can I appear before you after what has passed how can I hope for pardon  LORD BELMONT  Rise Clairville you have been to blame but so have I your fault has been the consequence of my imprudent choice of a governor for you You have forgot your duty but he was your seducer  CLAIRVILLE  No my Lord whatever reason I may have to complain of Mr Courteney in one particular instance in which I only am concerned yet let me justify to yourself your choice he has in every respect fulfilled your intentions and faithfully discharged the trust which you reposed in him  LORD BELMONT  Faithfully discharged his trust he who could engage in licentious brawls with his pupil and attempt the life of one committed to his care  CLAIRVILLE  My Lord  LORD BELMONT  Be silent you can say nothing that can extenuate guilt like this Mr Courteney after what has happened you must not reckon upon my friendshipthe salary I allowed you while travelling with my son is yours for lifebut we must meet no more if you consider the loss of my protection  as a misfortune remember you have yourself only to blame for it  COURTENEY  There is but one real misfortune my Lord which a man can suffer and that is when he is conscious of a crime and has any thing to reproach himself with The salary your Lordship offers me I will not accept judging of me as you do you cannot mean it as a reward and low as my fortunes are I will not be indebted to compassion for that which your esteem only ought to bestow upon me Lord Clairville I promised you an explanation before your father and  CLAIRVILLE  Hold Sir it is but just that I should first clear you of an imputation which cannot wound you more than it has meMy Lord you have reproached Mr Courteney without cause he sought not my life but gave it me when in his power I urged him with the most opprobrious terms to accept my challenge and when my rashness had given him an advantage he forbore to take it  LORD BELMONT  If this be true I have wronged him greatly wronged him  CLAIRVILLE  Oh Courteney a treacherous rival and a generous enemy how can you reconcile this contradiction  COURTENEY  I never was your rival my Lord it is my sister whom you have all this time addressed under the name of D'Arcy  CLAIRVILLE  Miss D'Arcy your sister  COURTENEY  Neither she nor I knew this circumstance till today when an accident which I shall ever remember discovered us to each other I opposed your passion for her at first through prudence but when I knew her to be my sister my honour was more immediately concerned to prevent the continuance of an attachment which could never have the sanction of your father's consent my sister with a spirit becoming her birth adopted my sentiments she refused your offered hand and consented that I should conduct her where you could not have access to her hence rose your jealousy and the consequences that followed  LORD BELMONT  Courteney you have acted nobly in this affair  COURTENEY  I have done my duty  LORD BELMONT  But what brought your sister hither and why did she conceal her name  COURTENEY  She took refuge with Miss Autumn from the bigotry of her aunt who not having been able to pervert her to the Roman Catholick religion by the offer of settling her whole fortune upon her was laying schemes to entrap her into a convent  LORD BELMONT  Something of this I heard before and had determined to enquire into itIs Miss Courteney still here  COURTENEY  She is my Lord but tomorrow I shall take her into the country Lord Clairville will then I hope forget a slight impression which he will have no oppurtunity of increasing  LORD BELMONT  Generous youthYet you have one more task to perform worthy your disinterestednessengage my sonI know your influence over himengage him to submit to my choice  CLAIRVILLE  Alas my Lord were it possible for me to cease to love Miss Courteney your commands were sufficientIn this and only in this one point I cannot obey you  LORD BELMONT  Courteney I rely upon your honour  COURTENEY  You may my Lord securely  LORD BELMONT  Worthy son of a father whom I loved and esteemed I will not intreat you to pardon the harsh treatment you have received from me till I have made you an atonement equal to the injuryI leave you to complete your reconciliation with your friend  Exit Lord  Belmont  CLAIRVILLE  I scarce can look up to you Courteney Such nobleness such generosity to fall under my mean suspicionsCan you forgive me  COURTENEY  Let us exchange forgiveness my LordI was to blame for leaving you so long in a mistake which occasioned these suspicions  CLAIRVILLE  My friend my brotheryes Courteney it must be soyour sister  COURTENEY  Think of her no more my LordAre you not convinced by what has past today that you are not to expect my concurrence in this affair  CLAIRVILLE  Alas I am indeedYet leave your sister to her own determination  COURTENEY  My sister is already determined  CLAIRVILLE  I see I am doomed to be miserable There is no hope of obtaining my father's consent and your too rigid honour  COURTENEY  Banish from your heart then a hopeless passion and if possible bend your will to your father's choice  CLAIRVILLE  Never Do not urge me on that head my resolution is fixed  Enter Lord  Belmont  Lady  Autumn  Miss  Autumn  Miss  Courteney  and  Simple  LADY AUTUMN  Oh Mr FreemanMr Courteney I mean how have you distressed me But I have pardoned you  COURTENEY  Your Ladyship is all goodness  Goes to Miss  Autumn  They talk apart  LORD BELMONT  Clairville you have still my pardon to obtain May I promise myself that you will merit it by submitting to my will  CLAIRVILLE  Alas my Lord what can I say I have not a heart to bestow I can promise only a negative obedienceI will not dispose of myself without your consent but  LORD BELMONT  This you promise then  CLAIRVILLE  I do my Lord    sighing    LORD BELMONT  'Tis something though not all that I have a right to expect from you  CLAIRVILLE  You have indeed my Lord a right to expect my obedience in all things possible but I can never  LORD BELMONT  Make no rash resolutions son for I will be obeyed Behold my choice  Taking Miss  Courteney's  hand and leading her towards him    MISS COURTENEY  surprized  My Lord  CLAIRVILLE  My father can this be real  LORD BELMONT  Take her Clairville the best the worthiest gift a father can bestow a truly virtuous woman She who could sacrifice her fortune to her conscience and subject her inclinations to her duty who could despise riches and triumph over love she brings you in herself a treasure more valuable than both the Indies Take her my son and endeavour to deserve her  CLAIRVILLE  Best of fathersthis amazing goodnessOh let me thank you thus  kneels  LORD BELMONT  Courteney I have yet but half discharged the debt I owe youGenerous young man had I a daughterbut in all things except the name I am your father  COURTENEY  All the gratitude the reverence the duty that sacred title claims expect from me my Lord  LADY AUTUMN  Mr Courteney after such a testimony to your merit I need not blush to declare my intentions  COURTENEY  I acknowledge your Ladyship's goodnessYou have permitted me to hope for favour here    addressing himself to Miss  Autumn  How blest should I be if you Madam would confirm it  LADY AUTUMN  How is this  MISS COURTENEY    half aside to Miss  Autumn  Now dear Charlotte do not play off any of your too agreeable airsDid you not half an hour ago own to me that  MISS AUTUMN  smiling  Ah do not betray meWell Sir since you have obtained my mama's consent though I cannot imagine how I will not hazard the loss of her favour by my disobedienceHere is my hand since it must be so  COURTENEY  Charming creature to deserve it will be my glory  LADY AUTUMN  I am confoundedSimpledo I dream  aside to her  SIMPLE  No indeed Madam you do not dream now you are but just awake and have been dreaming all this timeI always told your Ladyship that if the gentleman was in love it must be with one of the young ladies  LADY AUTUMN  Confusion  COURTENEY  What can this disorder mean dear Madam if I have been so unfortunate as to have offended you  LADY AUTUMN  Ah that seducing accentSimple even at this moment might not one believebut I shall relapselead me to my chambermy Lord a sudden indispositionoh what a delusion  Exeunt Lady  Autumn  and  Simple  COURTENEY  Here is some mystery  MISS AUTUMN    aside to Miss  Courteney  I could unfold it I believe  LORD BELMONT  to Miss  Autumn  Be not uneasy Madam I take upon myself to reconcile Lady Autumn to your generous choice  COURTENEY  Lord Clairville I give you joy and yet congratulations from me on the completion of your  wishes may appear selfinterested but if my sister continues to maintain those sentiments she has this day manifested the rectitude of her heart will in some measure atone for the inferiority of her rank and fortune As for me though perhaps I have proved myself rather too young to be your governor I am yet old enough to be your friend and shall ever be proud of that distinction not from the consideration of your wealth and honour but because I am convinced that you want neither example nor precept to instruct you that there are no characters so truly noble as that of a woman of virtue and a man of real honour  EPILOGUE  Written by Dr GOLDSMITH  Spoken by Mrs BULKLEY  WHAT five long actsand all to make us wiser  Our authoress sure has wanted an adviser  Had she consulted  me  she should have made  Her moral play a speaking masquerade  Warm'd up each bustling scene and in her rage  Have emptied all the Greenroom on the stage  My life on't this had kept her play from sinking  Have pleas'd our eyes and sav'd the pain of thinking  Well since she thus has shewn her want of skill  What if I give a masquerade I will  But how ay there's the rub  pausing  I've got my cue  The world's a masquerade the masquers you you you  To Boxes Pit Gall  Lud what a groupe the motley scene discloses  False wits false wives false virgins and false spouses  Statesmen with bridles on and close beside 'em  Patriots in party colour'd suits that ride 'em  There Hebes turn'd of fifty try once more  To raise a flame in Cupids of threescore  These in their turn with appetites as keen  Deserting fifty fasten on fifteen  Miss not yet full fifteen with fire uncommon  Flings down her sampler and takes up the woman  The little urchin smiles and spreads her lure  And tries to kill ere she's got power to cure  Thus 'tis with allTheir chief and constant care  Is to seem every thingbut what they are  Yon broad bold angry spark I fix my eye on  Who seems t' have robb'd his vizor from the lion  Who frowns and talks and swears with round parade  Looking as who should say  Damme who's afraid  mimicking  Strip but his vizor off and sure I am  You'll find his lionship a very lamb  Yon politician famous in debate  Perhaps to vulgar eyes bestrides the state  Yet when he deigns his real shape t' assume  He turns old woman and bestrides a broom  Yon patriot too who presses on your sight  And seems to every gazer all in white  If with a bribe his candour you attack  He bows turns round and whipthe man's a black  Yon critic toobut whither do I run  If I proceed our bard will be undone  Well then a truce since she requests it too  Do you spare her and I'll for once spare you
