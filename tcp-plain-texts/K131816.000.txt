mere novice in these affairs  Wood  Nay but listen to reason Mrs Dimity has not your master Mr Drugget invited me down to his countryseat in order to give me his daughter Nancy in marriage and with what pretence can he now break off  Dim  What pretenceyou put a body out of all patienceBut go on your own way Sir my advice is all lost upon you  Wood  You do me injustice Mrs Dimityyour advice has governed my whole conductHave not I sixed an interest in the young lady's heart  Dim  An interest in a fiddlestickyou ought to have made love to the father and motherwhat do you think the way to get a wife at this time of day is by speaking sine things to the lady you have a fancy for That was the practice indeed but things are alter'd nowyou must address the old people Sir and never trouble your head about your mistressNone of your  letters and verses and soft looks and fine speeches  Have compassion thou angelic creature on a poor dying  Pshaw stuff nonsense all out of fashion Go your ways to the old curmudgeon humour his whims  I shall esteem it an honour Sir to be allied to a gentleman of your rank and taste  Upon my word he's a pretty young gentleman  Then wheel about to the mother  Your daughter Ma'am is the very model of you and I shall adore her for your sake  Here come hither Nancy take this gentleman for better for worse  La mama I can never consent    I should not have thought of your consentthe consent of your relations is enough why how now hussey  So away you go to church the knot is tied an agreeable honeymoon follows the charm is then dissolv'd you go to all the clubs in St James's Street your lady goes to the Coterie and in a little time you both go to Doctor's Commons and if faults on both sides prevent a divorce you'll quarrel like contrary elements all the rest of your lives that's the way of the world now  Wood  But you know my dear Dimity the old couple have received every mark of attention from me  Dim  Attention to be sure you did not fall asleep in their company but what thenYou should have entered into their characters play'd with their humours and sacrificed to their absurdities  Wood  But if my temper is too frank  Dim  Frank indeed yes you have been frank enough to ruin yourselfHave not you to do with a rich old shopkeeper retired from business with an hundred thousand pounds in his pocket to enjoy the dust of the London road which he calls living in the countryand yet you must find fault with his situation What if he has made a ridiculous gimcrack of his house and gardens you know his heart is set upon it and could not you have commended his taste But you must be too frank  Those walks and alleys are too regularthose evergreens should not be cut  into such fantastic shapes  And thus you advise a poor old mechanic who delights in every thing that's monstrous to follow natureOh you're likely to be a successful lover  Wood  But why should I not save a fatherinlaw from being a laughingstock  Dim  Make him your fatherinlaw first  Wood  Why he can't open his windows for the dust he stands all day looking through a pane of glass at the carts and stagecoaches as they pass by and he calls that living in the fresh air and enjoying his own thoughts  Dim  And could not you let him go on his own way You have ruin'd yourself by talking sense to him and all your nonsense to the daughter won't make amends for itAnd then the mother how have you play'd your cards in that quarterShe wants a tinsel man of fashion for her second daughter"Don't you see says she how happy my eldest girl is made by marrying Sir Charles Rackett She has been married three entire weeks and not so much as one angry word has pass'd between themNancy shall have a man of quality too"  Wood  And yet I know Sir Charles Rackett perfectly well  Dim  Yes so do I and I know he'll make his lady wretched at lastBut what then You should have humour'd the old folksyou should have been a talking empty fop to the good old lady and to the old gentleman an admirer of his taste in gardening But you have lost himhe is grown fond of this beau Lovelace who is here in the house with him the coxcomb ingratiates himself by flattery and you're undone by frankness  Wood  And yet Dimity I won't despair  Dim  And yet you have reason to despair a million of reasonsTomorrow is fix'd for the weddingday Sir Charles and his lady are to be here this very night they are engag'd indeed at a great rout in town but they take a bed here notwithstandingThe family is sitting up for them Mr Drugget will keep you  all up in the next room there till they arriveand tomorrow the business is overand yet you don't despairhushhold your tongue here comes LovelaceStep in and I'll devise something I warrant you    Exit  Woodley  The old folks shall not have their own way'tis enough to vex a body to see an old father and mother marrying their daughter as they please in spite of all I can do  Exit  Enter  Drugget  and  Lovelace  Drug  And so you

fashion for dressing the hairbut I never heard of a fashion for the heart  Dim  Why then my dear the heart mostly follows the fashion now  Nan  Does itpray who sets the fashion of the heart  Dim  All the fine ladies in London o'my conscience  Nan  And what's the last new fashion pray  Dim  Why to marry any fop that has a few deceitful agreeable appearances about him something of a pert phrase a good operator for the teeth and tolerable taylor  Nan  And do they marry without loving  Dim  Oh marrying for love has been a great while out of fashion  Nan  Why then I'll wait till that fashion comes up again  Dim  And then Mr Lovelace I reckon  Nan  Pshaw I don't like him he talks to me as if he was the most miserable man in the world and the confident thing looks so pleas'd with himself all the whileI want to marry for love and not for cardplayingI should not be able to bear the life my sister leads with Sir Charles Rackettand I'll forfeit my new cap if they don't quarrel soon  Dim  Oh fie no they won't quarrel yet awhile A quarrel in three weeks after marriage would be somewhat of the quickestBy and by we shall hear of their whims and their humoursWell but if you don't like Mr Lovelace what say you to Mr Woodley  Nan  AhI don't know what to saybut I can sing something that will explain my mind  SONG  WHEN first the dear youth passing by  Disclos'd his fair form to my sight  I gaz'd but I could not tell why  My heart it went throb with delight  As nearer he drew those sweet eyes  Were with their dear meaning so bright  I trembled and lost in surprize  My heart it went throb with delight  When his lips their dear accents did try  The return of my love to excite  I feign'd yet began to guess why  My heart it went throb with delight  We chang'd the stol'n glance the fond smile  Which lovers alone read aright  We look'd and we sigh'd yet the while  Our hearts they went throb with delight  Consent I soon blush'd with a sigh  My promise I ventur'd to plight  Come Hymen we then shall know why  Our hearts they go throb with delight  Enter  Woodley  Wood  My sweetest angel I have heard all and my heart overflows with love and gratitude  Nan  Ah but I did not know you was listening You should not have betray'd me so Dimity I shall be angry with you  Dim  Well I'll take my chance for thatRun both into my room and say all your pretty things to one another there

when you have heard them you won't teize me any more  SONG  To dance and to dress and to flaunt it about  To run to park play to assembly and rout  To wander for ever in whim's giddy maze  And one poor hair torture a million of ways  To put at the glass ev'ry feature to school  And practise their art on each fop and each sool  Of one thing to think and another to tell  These these are the manners of each giddy belle  To smile and to simper white teeth to display  The time in gay follies to trifle away  Against every virtue the bosom to steel  And only of dress the anxieties feel  To be at Eve's ear the insiduous decoy  The pleasure ne'er taste yet the mischief enjoy  To boast of soft raptures they never can know  These these are the manners of each giddy beau  Exit  Love  I must have her notwithstanding thisfor tho' I'm not in love yet I'm in debt  Enter  Drugget  Drug  So Mr Lovelace any news from above stairs Is this absurd quarrel at an endHave they made it up  Love  Oh a

 Death and confusion there is no bearing thisyou may be as wrong as you please and may I never hold four by honours if I ever endeavour to set you right again  Exit  Enter  Mr  and  Mrs Drugget Woodley Lovelace  and  Nancy  Drug  What's here to do now  Lady R  Never was such a man bornI did not say a word to the gentlemanand yet he has been raving about the room like a madman  Drug  And about a club again I supposeCome hither Nancy Mr Woodley she is yours for life  Mrs D  My dear how can you be so  Drug  It shall be sotake her for life Mr Woodley  Wood  My whole life shall be devoted to her happiness  Love  The devil and so I am to be left in the lurch in this manner am I  Lady R  Oh this is only one of those polite disputes which people of quality who have nothing else to differ about must always be liable toThis will all be made up  Drug  Never tell meit's too late nowMr Woodley I recommend my girl to your careI shall have nothing now to think of but my greens and my images and my shrubberythough mercy on all married folks say I for these wranglings are I am afraid  What we must all come to  Lady Rackett  coming forward  WHAT we must all come to  WhatCome to what  Must broils and quarrels be the marriage lot  If that's the wise deep meaning of our poet  The man's a fool a blockhead and I'll shew it  What could induce him in an age so nice  So fam'd for virtue so refin'd from vice  To form a plan so trivial false and low  As if a belle could quarrel with a beau  As if there werein these thrice happy days  One who from nature or from reason strays  There's no cross husband now no wrangling wife  The man is downright ignorant of life  'Tis the millennium thisdevoid of guile  Fair gentle truth and white rob'd candour smile  From every breast the sordid love of gold  Is banish'd quiteno boroughs now are sold  Pray tell me Sirsfor I don't know I vow  Prayis there such a thing as Gaming now  Do peers make laws against that giant vice  And then at Arthur's break them in a trice  Nonoour lives are virtuous all austere and hard  Pray Ladiesdo you ever see a card  Those empty boxes shew you don't love plays  The managers poor souls get nothing now a days  If here you comeby chance but once a week  The pit can witness that you never speak  Pensive Attention sits with decent mien  No paint no naked shoulders to be seen  And yet this grave this moral pious age  May learn one useful lesson from the stage  Shun strife ye fair and once a contest o'er  Wake to a blaze the dying flame no more  From fierce debate fly all the tender loves  And Venus cries "Coachman putto my doves"  The genial bed no blooming Grace prepares  "And every day becomes a day of cares"  FINIS
