Representation  Songs Chorusses c  ACT  AIR by Mr DODD  I  Which sense of the five does not Bacchus delight  He's a rose to the Smell He's a ruby to Sight  From the flask as He sparkles He sings to the car  And He's soft to the Touch as to Taste He is dear  'Gain'st his Godhead 'tis impious for Mortals to strive  For each sense should be His who can cherish the five  II  But no charm that He gives no delight He supplies  Is so sweet as the Opiate He sheds o'er our sighs  For when Care or dull Sorrow perplexes our breasts  He can banish the Senses that harbour such Guests  To his God  ead let Mortals then servently call  Who can sooth every Sense by suspending them all  AIR by Mr BANNISTER  I  Soon as the busy Day is o'er  And Evening comes with pleasant shade  We Gondoliers from shore to shore  Merrily ply our jovial trade  And while the Moon shines on the stream  And as soft music breathes around  The feathering oar returns the gleam  And dips in concert to the sound  II  Down by some Convent's mould'ring walls  Oft we bear the enamour'd youth  Softly the watchful Fair he calls  Who whispers vows of Love and Truth  And while the Moon c  III  "And oft where the Rialto swells  "With happier pairs we circle round  "Whose secret sighs fond Eccho tells  "Whose murmur'd vows she bids resound  And while the Moon c  IV  "Then joys the Youth that Love conceal'd  "That fearful Love must own its sighs  "Then smiles the Maid to hear reveal'd  "How more than ever she complies"  And while c  AIR by Mr DU BELLAMY  I  By adverse Fate when Beauty sighs  A mingled claim our bosoms prove  'Tis Virtue grac'd with gentler ties  'Tis Pity soften'd into Love  II  Blest doubly blest his transport glows  Whose Pity can each joy refine  When from that Godlike source it flows  The generous passion is divine  AIR by Mrs CARGILL  I  In my pleasant native plains  Wing'd with bliss each moment flew  Nature there inspir'd the strains  Simple as the joys I knew  Jocund Morn and Evening gay  Claim'd the merry Roundelay  II  Fields and slocks and fragrant flow'rs  All that health and joy impart  Call'd for artless Music's pow'rs  Faithful ecchoes to the heart  Happy hours for ever gay  Claim'd the merry Roundelay  III  But the breath of genial Spring  Wak'd the warblers of the grove  Who sweet birds that heard you sing  Wou'd not join the song of love  Your sweet notes and chauntings gay  Claim'd the merry Roundelay  AIR by Mr DU BELLAMY  I  "Not for thy wings oh God of love  "Sighs the Youth that wou'd not rove  "Not for thy arrow pants the heart  "Blest to seel the mutual dart  II  "But that I ne'er may jealous live  "Me thy careless childhood give  "And to secure unchang'd delight  "Share thy band and veil my sight"  AIR by Mrs CARGILL  I  Yes I long for the comical sight  Such a pair of odd Lovers to meet  When they're wedded in Fortune's despigh  How I'll laugh at the pleasant deceit  II  O but once let the knot be fast join'd  Low I'll curtsey and wish you both joy  She by chance such a treasure to find  You by art such a prize to decoy  QUARTETTO  Mr BANNISTER Mrs WRIGHTEN Mr SUETT and Mrs CARGILL  LUCIO  By example be taught rash Lover beware

his sofa creep  Sipping his teahalfasleep  Curse the vapours  Reach the papers  What's the operaDem the play  II  Air my boots I think I'll ride  Tho' rot it no  It shakes one so  Let them bring the visavis  Lounging there his Lordship see  With vacant air  And sullen stare  Born of dullness rais'd by pride  III  Stop at Betty'sWhat's the news  A battle they say  Have you pines today  Yes my LordWe've beat the Dutch  Hasome iceI thought as much  What and nothing more  That's a monstrous bore  Well drive to Issachar the Jews  IV  Last at Brookes'sdeep at play  Issachar's debt  At Faro set  Win or lose serenely sad  Calm he sits nor vex'd nor glad  'Till half alive  He  cuts  at five  This  is a Petitmaitre's day  AIR by Mrs WRIGHTEN  What a Lover is he that has nothing to give  But a look and a vow and a sigh  Silly maid take my word you should know how to live  Before you're so ready to die  How stupid a pair are the Bridegroom and Bride  Who wed but for cooing and billing  Oh how dull will they be as they sit side by side  If it happens they're not worth a shilling  At first by good luck every hour of the day  'Tis my darling my soul's dearest pleasure  But at last says the wife I want money to pay  Come give it my heart's richest treasure  "But I have it not sweeting"This theme may breed strife  "Come let us be cooing and billing"  Go barbarous HusbandGo termagant Wise  So it happens when not worth a shilling  TRIO and CHORUS By Miss PHILLIPS Mr DUBELLAMY Mr WILLIAMS c  VALENTIO  Now when bashful daylight's gone  And night that hides a blush comes on  With

they lov'd each others joy  Together o'er the hills they stray'd  II  Their parents saw and bless'd their love  Nor wou'd their happiness delay  Tomorrow's dawn their bliss should prove  Tomorrow be their weddingday  III  When as at eve beside the brook  Where stray'd their flocks they sat and smil'd  One luckless lamb the current took  'Twas Rosalie'sshe started wild  IV  Run Lubin run my

'Gainst sixtytwo  O luckless lot  His bow he drew  At me he shot  Twang went the string  Whizz flew the dart  On a grey goose wing  To an old man's heart  But I'll be merry  Hey down derry  Dull sorrow I'll drown  Derry down down  Or laugh at them all  Tol de rol lol  AIR by Mrs WRIGHTEN  O never be one of those sad silly fellows  Who always are snappish suspicious and jealous  Who live but
