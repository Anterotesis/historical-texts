 LUXURY NO POLITICAL EVIL BUT DEMONSTRATIVELY PROVED TO BE NECESSARY TO THE PRESERVATION AND PROSPERITY OF STATES  Addressed to THE BRITISH SENATE  Le Superflu chose très necessaire  VOLT  Mondain  LONDON SOLD BY R BALDWIN PATERNOSTERROW  Price    ADVERTISEMENT  FOR much of the reasoning in this Tract the Author is indebted to a French Treatise published some years since in Paris  LUXURY NO POLITICAL EVIL  THE influence of Luxury on the prosperity of States gives rise to one of those questions on which most men have something to say but wherein they generally disagree  If to acquire a just idea of Luxury with respect to bodies politic were a matter of mere curiosity one would not dream of treating on a subject which so many writers have handled already and to little purpose but the reasoning which may be established on this head is of the utmost importance  It interests the prosperity of States and of course it is the duty of a good citizen to throw all the light upon it he can  There is one striking observation that occurs upon this subject though in theory the common opinion is against it in practice the world is for it though moralists inveigh against it wise statesmen have encouraged it If Luxury be a vice and cause those disasters so often imputed to it why have not some measures been taken to suppress it But if on the contrary it be a necessary resource without which every thing would languish we cannot place this truth in too clear a view lest any unforeseen any impolitic attack upon it should destroy that source on which the opulence of the State and public welfare depend  Where there is a certain extent of empire the genius and labour of a numerous people are able to effect wonders and it is the chief interest of such a State to encourage labour and industry to the utmost  Nature facilitates this object by that diversity she has scattered in her productions  by the wants she has laid man open to by the faculty she has endowed him with and by the desire she has implanted in him for all kinds of indulgences consistent with his being  The legislature then after the most sacred assurances to the artificer that he shall enjoy the whole fruits of his labour ought to leave  him  to the full scope of his abilities and the consumer to the luxuriance of his fancy without any other restriction than to prohibit the purchase of foreign productions and that only in certain cases very maturely considered and more seldom restrained than is commonly thought necessary  Certain assurances that every one shall receive the price of his labour is so capital a condition that without it emulation would die away and the hope of obtaining by our labour sufficient to gratify our wishes is another condition equally capital without which there would scarce be any emulation at all  Could we suppose a state where luxuries are prohibited men would be in a great  measure idle for our natural wants consuming less than our labour will produce if other incitements did not actuate the industry of the people the progress of the State would stand still when it might otherwise be carried to a great extent for though the leisure hours of the people might be employed in securing their territory from the encroachments of an enemy yet these being completed time would hang heavy upon their hands and as excess of plenty would embarrass and men are not fond of working without a prospect of personal advantage they would limit their productions to the bounds of consumption and being forbidden the enjoyment of indulgences they wouId work no more  But if among a numerous people the workman be left to the full scope of his industry and the consumer to the luxuriance of his fancy the mind will unfold and arts will multiply every inclination be animated and the State if not checked in its progress by a defect in its constitution  will stretch to the utmost extent of prosperity  For the arts whether useful or frivolous create without intermission a variety of indulgences many indeed of a short duration but which leave with us such a wish for their continuance as to become afterwards a kind of want Hence a spirit of industry is kept up hence an abundance of every thing we wish hence a numerous population This chain of effects brings wealth brings strength brings lasting felicity to an empire  Wealth results from this chain of effects by the quantity of materials produced and strength by the number of men these materials support  But with respect to a numerous population we must advert to observation and reason from the superintendence of Providence which is particularly careful of every species of animals increasing or diminishing the species in proportion to the quantity of provisions among them and the uses to which they are appropriated Beasts of prey that proul the desarts for subsistence  and which being of a carnivorous kind men use not for food are slow breeders and very few in number such are the lion the tiger and some others but graminivorous animals that live upon the spontaneous productions of the earth such as the sheep the swine the hare and many others are fast breeders and multiply exceedingly for these would live even without the assistance of man Where there is plenty of food the animal race will multiply surprisingly witness the great encrease of vermin in a granary full of corn And as it is with animals of an inferior class so it is with man One man and one woman might in the nature of things have thirty children but in general they might have ten five males and five females At every generation then was mankind propagated to the utmost they would increase in number five times so that in a very short space of time a nation might become exceedingly populous Now it is the difficulty of procuring food and obtaining the necessaries of life that checks this propagation A very wise interference of ProvidenceHence it  is that in the brutal creation the lioness does not breed so fast as the hare it requiring a large tract of country to supply the former with food and hence it is with the human species in tribes of savages who live by hunting and require an extensive district to furnish them with provisions that propagation does not take place in so great a degree as in civilized societies where by the genius and industry of man a few acres of ground are rendered sufficient to support a family  As the wealth then and strength of a country depend in a great measure upon its population and as population increases or diminishes in proportion to the provisions of life would it not be wise to encourage husbandry as well as manufactures and cultivate the country to the utmost  But to return to my subject Though man is formed to live upon the spontaneous productions of the earth a thirst for Luxuries is natural to him and without such a thirst societies could neither flourish nor exist Without a desire for Luxuries our intellectual faculties would be a disadvantage  to us we should languish away our hours in stupidity occupied only with the momentary want and that being destined by nature to unite itself with its fellowcreatures in embellishing the earth would wear away its days in solitude lost in the forests with the lower class of animals It is the idea alone of improving our situation and adding to our happiness that urges us to the trouble of thinking and to no other object could our understanding be applied  The views of creation take place with certainty they produce their effects infallibly Though man in the midst of unfavourable circumstances that weaken or check the exertion of his faculties be still through the favour of Providence in a situation to preserve his existence without any other care than that of gathering the provisions that are scattered round him and though this may suggest to him an idea of being in solitude yet the Author of all that breathes has not left him at liberty to withdraw himself from the purposes for which he was created That active spirit that intellectuall faculty that power of completion with  which he is endowed will not suffer him to shut himself up in the narrow sphere of absolute necessity It rests not with him to reject his benefits when he perceives the means of procuring them His first attempts make him sensible of a want of union with other men and this is the origin of all societies  As a thirst then for indulgences or Luxuries or a wish to render life more comfortable than nature bestows it is the first cause of societies so it is the very soul and support of them The more raging this thirst is the more men study to reap advantages from one another and from every thing about them The mind quickens the means of every individual increase and these means are the sinews of the body politic  What strength would a society of naked savages have reposing in a thicket living from day to day by hunting and on wild fruits changing their place of abode as they exhaust the district possessing only a bow a few arrows and perhaps a tomahawk  and having no time to spare from the search of their daily food  Such a society cannot derive an advantage even from numbers the mode of each man's living requiring a great extent of ground Now independent of that check to population occasioned by fatigue and scarcity of food incident to such a state of life it is evident that if families here encrease they will be obliged to divide and separate at great distances from each other in order to procure provisions and presently becoming enemies by contention for an object so essential as food they will fall on one another furiously Such is the picture the uncivilized part of the world presents us  The savage however who makes use of a bow has already stept over the first boundaries of his nature This instrument is a convenience by which he extends his primitive power and facilitates the execution of his designs It is a species of Luxury This savage without any assistance could supply his wants before he had a bow He who makes use of a carriage well hung to convey himself without fatigue where  his affairs call him acts no otherwise than he who employs a weapon to obtain his prey without being at the trouble of running after it  A little reflection will be sufficient to shew the effects which a desire to render life comfortable has upon the strength and power of a nation  Once a society of men weary of wandering and living in the open air begins to erect cabbins for their defence against the injuries of time and of course to fix their abode it is easy to conceive that this first idea of convenience will give birth to a thousand others The same inclination that produces one leads them to covet more When they can store provisions they wish to collect them They sow grain about their dwellings raise vegetables and breed different kinds of animals both for food and for labour  In this state their substance increases they have time upon their hands are more sedentary and communicate a great deal together By such comunication they catch ideas from each other and what they  already possess furnishes them with means to carry their ideas into execution Families increase in consequence of their ease and where there is sufficient extent of territory the society is continually spreading Each individual applies his genius to facilitate his labour The discoveries of some become a benefit to others and with the aid of these inventions the labour of a few supplies the wants of many  Such as are unemployed in husbandry will not straggle wide in search of new lands to cultivate Attached to each other by the ties of friendship parentage and habit they will continue with their brethren and seek by their genius and industry to repay those who furnish them with subsistence  Whilst then a people living strangers to Luxury and confining themselves to the first simple gifts which Nature bestows living naked without any settled habitation without agriculture continues ever while it so exists in the same state of weakness indigence and stupidity a more active people studying to improve their situation  becomes daily more and more enlightened and are constantly gathering strength and wealth so long as moral causes do not impede their progress Hence then occurs the following plain reasoning  The idea of building a house and that of raising plants for food are dictated by that natural instinct which leads man to profit by his genius employing it to procure himself conveniences From these first ideas flow a thousand others as a consequence of the same principle and altogether produce the formation of great societies and their power Hence arise arts manufactures trades and all the luxuries of life that constitute the strength and power of a nation  To reason closely gilded cielings bronzes porcelain are in fact no more Luxuries than shoes or stockings In Poland in Hungary and in some parts of Scotland the peasantry in common cover not their feet or legs with any thing whenever they do it is by way of dress as white gloves are worn by us Men and women there take long journeys barefooted even at times when the country is covered with  snow All is relative Shoes to a person who never wore any are a very  troublesome  superfluity A precious vase upon a chimneypiece is an  agreeable  superfluity Ornaments that decorate the house the clothes or the furniture of the rich are perhaps less superfluities to them than the money would be with which they purchase them if they had no other use to convert it to  It is idle to talk of one thing being more a Luxury than another All superfluities are Luxuries and what is not immediately necessary is superfluous of course eveyr thing that is not essential to our existence is a Luxury He who not finding himself at ease when sleeping on the ground contrived to weave the first mat of rushes for his repose consulted his indulgence as much as he who since composed the bed of down They each made use of those materials they could get It was circumstance only that prevented the one as well as the other from accomplishing the object of his wishes  If I may without Luxury cover myself with a sheepskin merely cut and made into a form to fit me and enable me to use my limbs if I may also without being reproached with Luxury carry my ingenuity further and make me a coat with the wool of this animal coarsely spun do I deserve to be called luxurious if I spin this wool finer weave it better and clothe myself with a better kind of stuff I make use only of my abilities and my understanding to answer my intentions in the best manner possible which is to clothe myself conveniently and comfortably As soon then as I am allowed to make use of art be it ever so little to procure me any one enjoyment upon what principles would they prohibit my employing all the art of which I am capable Would they alledge that Luxury consists in cleverness of execution  And if I may without Luxury make use of the wool a part of one animal I may equally without incurring reproach employ the parts of any other animal or any thing convertible into clothes whether it be goatsbeard flax cotton or silk  These materials bear all the same rank in nature and when I can obtain them I may indifferently use them as I please one is in itself no more a Luxury than another The same may be said of every thing I use The materials of which a thing is made are no more a Luxury than the thing itself Gold and lead diamonds and flints are productions of the earth intrinsically equal My choice only is reprehensible or not according as the qualities of the materials I use answer or not answer my intentions In considering things absolutely there is no other rule to go by  If then useful inventions and those that are merely pleasurable partake as is evident they do of the same principle if all things that are not immediately necessary are Luxuries it is ridiculous to condemn either this or that a manufacture of the most trifling article is not without its advantage to the state as it tends to create that disbursement from which the state draws it resources and employs a number of hands  He that would have the most frivolous toy or the most useful piece of furniture  cannot acquire either one or the other but by his own labour or by paying for the labour of a workman If he makes the thing himself whether it be useful or frivolous he must be precedently provided with subsistence or supply for his other necessary wants during the time he is at work If he borrows the assistance of another he must feed and supply the wants of that other during the time he employs him or give him an equivalent for his trouble In both these cases no time is employed that is subtracted from necessary want The two inhabitants are supported the taxes are paid and the produce of this labour be it of what kind it will equally augments the stock of national wealth Unnecessary things bear a price as well as things of use  Further it generally happens that in the fabrication of a frivolous thing the maker gets a living which perhaps he could not otherwise do and the purchaser an enjoyment which he would not otherwise have Besides in making this bauble the artist perhaps exercises a talent which one day or other may be applied to more useful  purposes The toyman for example who makes dolls of  papier macheé  today shall if required make instrumentcases and boxes of the same materials tomorrow He knows how to set about it  Let us suppose for a moment that superfluities or unnecessary things were prohibited or unknown and let us suppose which is by no means the truth that every man had ground to till In this case the active man who by the fruits of his labour would be in a situation to procure himself superfluities but having no such desire and not knowing what to do with the product of his labour would work no longer The man also whose profession it is to make superfluities cultivates as much ground as supplies him with food and  he  works no more Here now are two inhabitants merely supported in a contrary hypothesis and how is the state affected by the change Cultivation is not so extended and the value of those superfluities which would otherwise have been made is lost for the natural wants of man consuming less than his labour will produce if his spare time  be not employed in necessary articles the benefit of his time must be lost to society  It is the same in gratifications from which we draw nothing substantial such as dancing music public exhibitions and the like Suppress these pleasures and let the men who are thus employed busy themselves in cultivation what then Those before employed in husbandry would not have occasion to work so much consequently there would be no more hands employed in cultivation than before nor any greater quantity of productions and society at the same time would have fewer arts and less enjoyments  Government might certainly in many cases employ the time and industry of the people in a more advantageous manner to the state than by suffering them to labour for the produce of unnecessary things but if Government has no employ to set them about and the time must come when Government cannot employ every individual unengaged in husbandry or necessary business or if Government does not employ them after men have provided for their  natural wants if superfluities are prohibited they will be idle On the contrary if Luxuries are encouraged whatever be the object on which these men employ their spare time it cannot but turn to the advantage of the nation since the object they covet must be acquired by work  Work if I may use the expression is a second creator Without the form which this gives to matter almost all that infinity of productions with which the earth teems would be lost to us Surrounded with a thousand possible benefits we should wear out our days bereft of all  A nation can no way multiply its possessions be rich or powerful nor can it anyway be prosperous but through the labour of the people The great object then in administration is to encourage and reward industry No matter what the object be that incites it Not even trifles can be produced but by that useful labour which adds to the strength of a state There would be no musicians mountebanks or makers of toys unless men gained a livelihood by such professions These men must be fed and they  are fed by the labour of others in return for the amusements they afford Provisions therefore produced by these objects do not exist the less because the objects are frivolous and as provisions cannot be produced but by cultivation of land it follows that musicians mountebanks  c  are proportionally instrumental to cultivation Like the minstrels of old who were employed by lords of manors to divert the copyholders whilst they were at work for them As music enlivens the spirits and encreases activity where is the impropriety of one man's saying to another on condition that you will pipe to me whilst I am employed I will do your work as well as my own Without such an incitement a man would abate in his exertions and he would work only for himself Besides these men so fed and these provisions that feed them may be otherwise employed as circumstances may require and it is no small advantage to a state to have a number of men in reserve for by the doctrine before advanced plenty of provisions naturally increases population and as occasional inclination to spend  money in amusements idle as it may appear encourages work this work multiplies provisions promotes population and augments the wealth of individuals so that society not only has a reserve of men to answer particular purposes but the public taxes are more cheerfully paid for if a man's taxes amount to ten pounds his contribution is less felt if he possesses sixty pounds than if he possessed only thirty  We are too apt to annex the idea of Luxury to articles which indulge a sensual gratification to things of ornament and magnificence to the delicacies of the table and certain peculiar indulgences but this is begging the question I have already proved that whatever is not immediately necessary to our existence is a Luxury and if a Luxury is not condemnable in one case it is not in another I speak now as to Luxuries in general there may be indeed certain species of Luxuries that may injure the morals of a community and to this the Legislative power should advert but this is no argument for condemning Luxuries in the gross since it is by Luxury alone that any state can exist  We do not reflect that when the first necessaries of life are supplied man is in want of things that give pleasure as much as any other and that these articles which refresh him are probably less superfluous than a great number of inventions that are merely useful The wine a man drinks can perhaps less be dispensed with than the watch in his pocket That which pleases interests as much as that which is useful There is no dissipation or corruption in this both are equally good in their place A gold enamelled box which a variety of arts combine to embellish is not indeed so useful as a clock it is equally useful however with a rose or a tulip whose form and richness of colouring enrapture the eye Pleasure is a real good Nature would make us sensible of it and with this view she has taken care to adorn her works Was the earth without flowers without verdure to produce only fruits would human beings in its dreary surface robbed of the odoriferous persumes and enchanting scenes of spring lose nothing Would they have nothing to regret  Those who declaim against Luxury seem wilfully blind They call nothing Luxuries that is of any standing this censure falls only on modern inventions and refinements they cannot be made to see that what they permit as useful and allowable is of the same nature with that they condemn nor will they reflect that such things as escape their censure now were at the time they were first made and according to their principles ought to be as much classed among Luxuries as things they now proscribe They will not see that the modern improvements they condemn are the natural consequence of perfection in the arts and the progress of the mind and taste  Men have always carried Luxury to the highest pitch they could Want of means or knowledge was the only thing that stopped them If we build our houses more magnisicently ornament them more superbly and make them more convenient than was done five hundred years ago it is because we have found out that it is better so to do and because the progress of arts enable us to do it It is on the same principle  that we widen our streets and pave them better  Say not that Luxury is injurious to a people cast your eyes over the face of the world and take the nations in review Those people where you find the greatest Luxury are the most powerful England France Italy hold doubtless the first rank in Europe and these are the countries where Luxury reigns in her greatest glory What renown for power and grandeur did the ancient people of Asia so famous for their Luxury acquire Asia even now in spite of the destructive effects of those governments that are there established preserves still a degree of Luxury How much does it eclipse both Africa and the greatest part of America whose unfortunate inhabitants are acquainted with scarce any thing beyond the first necessaries of life  It may be objected that a thirst for Luxuries in augmenting the desires and expences of each individual necessarily augments the price of labour throughout all classes of men that of course the state is under a necessity of paying higher salaries to its officers  and encreasing its pensions and that such a surcharge of expence undermining it by degrees must end in its ruin This is easily answered That a desire for Luxuries increases the price of labour is very true but this increase of price does not arise from an augmentation of our desires and wants but from an increase of wealth brought about by the encouragement thus given to industry and that spur to work which is the source of almost all our riches If then through the existence of Luxury Government is obliged to pay a greater price it has also more resources to pay it from Its expences and resources are proportioned to each other and the State gains by Luxury in becoming more happy and more powerful  In reasoning from facts on a principle of politics we must take care not to attribute to Luxury evils which flow only from a defect in that government where such facts are observed The pretensions of officers in any state can never force it to pay greater salaries than it is capable of doing or than its natural means will admit of An oeconomy  founded on reason and modified by circumstances should preside over the public expences It is not necessary that for a hundred sheep there should be fifty shepherds nor that an impolitic financier prodigal of the public money should be at liberty to tax the people at his will to support those shepherds That Luxury favours the prosperity of States is evident but this is provided the constitution of the government there established does not destroy its useful influence  It has been said that Luxury renders men venal robs them of their public spirit and disposes them to become slaves This I deny Men never sell themselves but when there are proper purchasers Suppress the abilities of the corrupter and they will continue uncorrupted in the midst of the greatest Luxury On the contrary whoever has many favours to bestow and is in possession of great power will turn them to his advantage whether men are luxurious or not It is not Luxury that corrupts mankind they are naturally corrupt from disposition and when so disposed would as soon devote  themselves to another for a mere livelihood as for great sums of money Sp Maelius in Rome aspired to the throne He gained one half the people by the corn he distributed and had it not been for the activity of the Senate who discovered this project the Romans so jealous of their liberty would have lost it from that hour  The same reasoning will hold good among ourselves If the vices of administration did not by secret pensions and other rewards enable gentlemen to purchase their seats in parliament there would be no seats to be purchased Time was when we were obliged to court gentlemen to represent us and even pay them for their attendance but since a corrupt system of politics has introduced venality into parliament the very electors themselves will not give their votes without a reward  Public spirit seldom gives way in the members of a State but when men derive no advantage from such spirit and we do not renounce liberty but when we despair of preserving it It is not Luxury that gives birth to these unfortunate dispositions they  arise from a constitution of government where the rights of the people and the prince are all combined for the common interests of both  It is an error therefore to reproach Luxury with gradually gaining such an ascendency over minds that are more constrained by obligations or by necessity to be thus corrupt than from any natural inclinations If men devote themselves to the service of others it is because they are so circumstanced that they cannot avoid it Should it be urged that the unnecessary expences we enter into lead us into such situations I do aver that these extra expences are ultimately owing to the constitution of a State Spending of money through mere ostentation can never be general but in a country where the law bends under the powerful and is strong only against the weak where favour decides all where we cannot hope to obtain any thing through equity merit or reason solely and where money chiefly opens the gates to honours to dignities and to high offices We see then that it is not Luxury that rules even  when we give the greatest way to it we are led on by very different motives by views of vanity ambition and fortune and even in many cases by the simple view of supporting the situation we are in Where men are respected according to the appearance they make they will endeavour to make the best appearance they can  In Switzerland and Holland we nowhere see that ridiculous extravagance resulting from a sumptuous outside with poverty and misery beneath it Expences there are more judiciously distributed And why Men are not there formed of a different nature They have not a finer discernment in that which truly constitutes their happiness and if we estimate the general expence of the whole inhabitants of these countries we shall find that each spends in conveniencies in superfluities in short in luxuries a good deal more than do those people whom we think we are justifiable in reproaching with being extravagantly luxurious The good conduct of the Swiss and the Dutch in this matter is cleared up by the political constitution of their countries  No degree of despotism is there known Offices are not venal The rigor of the laws and the determination of appointments are not in proportion there to credit and the reputation of being rich A man may become poor among them without any danger to his safety or his advancement In whatever place it be where other manners reign with another form of government it would be idle to attempt a reformation of those manners by the voice of exhortation until a change took place in its political constitution  But men say the adversaries of Luxury enter thus into expences they cannot afford Who can determine this What is more fluctuating or more unknown than the fortunes of individuals What is more variable than the use made of these fortunes You tax a man with Luxury for running into certain expences because you suppose his circumstances will not admit of them they  do  however admit of them of course they must be more considerable than you imagine or perhaps the man saves it in some articles to spend it upon others and thus puts himself in a situation to gratify  himself in those objects you condemn When a man enters into expences of Luxury the fact proves that for the moment he is enabled to do it He is certainly without reproach if his expences do not tend to injure his fortune If they do it is not his desire for Luxuries that ought to be condemned but his misconduct He would be equally to blame if he hurt his fortune by any other expences or even idleness Such steps would equally reduce him to the situation of those who ruin themselves by Luxury because in such a case a man is more expensive than he ought to be His fault is not spending his money upon any particular object but spending in the whole more than he can afford But this though an injury to himself is not so to the state on which the present question only hangs  As little as we are accustomed to consider things in a general way we know that one individual cannot injure his fortune nor render himself reprehensible for his expences without enriching or at least giving bread by this means to other individuals We know that these expences whatever  they are being entered into in society go if I may so express myself merely from the lefthand to the right and do no injury to the body politic  There is no doubt but that the gratifications of Luxury as far as they tend to injure individuals may with some foundation be condemned from the pulpit and by such writers as undertake to advise mankind for their private good  Such is the Author of a tract that has run through many editions called  The Way to be Rich and Respectable  containing among other things a variety of estimates of family expences adapted to every one's circumstances shewing how comfortably people may live upon a little with oeconomy  Luxury disproportioned to a man's fortune in life is certainly blameable nay though proportioned to his fortune it is still reprehensible when the expences it leads him into and the indulgences he gives way to carry him beyond the proper bounds of decency and moderation  But what is vicious in these two cases does not interest the body politic and is not injurious but to those individuals on  whom such censure justly falls Policy which sees nothing but in the aggregate is not affected by any small number of particular inconveniences She does not feel the folly of a citizen whose Luxury has ruined his affairs and provoked the public censure She finds in a general spirit of Luxury a principle to encourage labour and in labour a fund of riches and enjoyments without end from whence result the power of the State and the happiness of its subjects Luxury says Melon  Political Essays on Commerce chap  is an idle term which would banish every operation of policy and commerce it carrying with it false vague and confused ideas whose abuse tends to check industry in its source  A spirit of Luxury continually labouring to create new pleasures and furnish new conveniences begets indeed a great many frivolous things but how seducing soever this desire for frivolous things may be supposed we have no reason to fear that it will so invade a whole nation as to make them madly neglect the useful and truly convenient  in order to dedicate their whole time pains and industry to procure themselves trifles We shall never see a person deprive himself of bread to purchase baubles for his chimneypiece nor go without shoes to adorn himself with lace Trifles have no attraction but with people who know no want  The wretched situation of numbers abounding in wealth and indulgences militates against Luxury and leads us to consider it as debauchery We become angry to see whole families languishing under the want of necessaries whilst others are squandering their substance in pleasures trifles and ostentation Why say we should man standing by birth upon a natural equality experience so different a lot Our sensibility shakes our judgment We severely reproach the wealthy with their enjoyments as if these enjoyments were taken from the subsistence of the poor and as if the poor would not feel equal distress were the rich to bury their treasures Whilst we are touched with commiseration for the unfortunate who groan under the scourge  of poverty we should not suffer our feelings to shut our eyes against the injustice of those who complain  The prosperity of a State necessarily depends upon right of property If the enjoyment of the fruit of my industry if my savings my acquisitions are not secured to me in the most sacred manner so that they are fully and wholly at my own disposal my emulation dies away and I should cease to work where I reap no profit Whatever use the owner may make of his revenue or his gains he does not enjoy it at the expence of another If he hoards his property is of no use to any one but himself if he spends that is to say if he indulges himself in Luxury then every agent he employs for his gratifications receives part of his fortune in the sums of money he pays In distributing his income thus he is far more beneficial to the State than if forgetting himself he should dispose of it in acts of beneficence These men on whom his liberality would fall would consume it without producing any thing whereas the  produce of those who worked for him would continue after the consumption of their pay and be of some value  Besides in the latter case the state would contain every where men versed in the practice of the arts instead of useless men who know not how to turn their hands to any thing Emulation diffused among workmen animates their industry a variety of inventions springs from their efforts the mind gathers knowledge and powers progression takes place and society gains in a thousand ways by the concurrence of so many effects  But the utility of Luxury in men of property is not confined to the emulation spread among workmen who have only to depend upon their labour A desire for Luxuries begets a love of property makes a man attentive to the preservation of his wealth puts him upon the search of means to improve his income excites others to the same by his example and will not suffer any order of men to vegetate in idleness Without such a spur as a desire for Luxuries occasions many perhaps sensible  of no want would sleep over their wealth and turn it to little or no advantage  What is it that supports this country but its Luxuries Were sumptuary laws established or the superfluities of life taxed so high as to render men of small fortune unable to procure them Government would defeat its own views and the interest of the national debt would be unpaid Were we to consider well the vast sums of money which the Luxuries of life bring into the Public Treasury it would soon shew the impolicy of any step towards their extinction Half the revenues of this country arises from duties on articles not immediately necessary to the existence or even the happiness of the people such as wine spirits beer tobacco tea sugar glass china pictures wheels postchaises men servants newspapers and a thousand others that could be very well dispensed with But on the encouragement of Luxuries the riches of a kingdom depend it not only enables a state to provide for its internal defence to extend its territories and augment its commerce but contrary to a received  opinion it tends to increase population as I have already shewn and in which the wealth and strength of a nation has long been allowed to consist  But after all What is the inconvenience attending Luxury that it is so much decried I have corn and wine more than I can consume Their quantity puts me to an expence to keep it It is a superfluity that encumbers me I exchange it for a superfluity I wish for the enjoyment of which rewards my labours and stimulates my emulation How then would you have me dispose of this superfluity Give it to the indigent who are in want of sustenance I do so but instead of giving it to an idle pauper one without talents and whom charity has rendered of little use to society I give it to persons who relying upon trade or industry for support have no occasion to stoop to others for their bread They eat it without humiliation They have earned it It is their own Besides in giving it to such people I serve the State by the taxes their labour produces  whilst at the same time I am serving  them  Luxury is accused of decreasing population that Luxury which supports so many families which invites so many workmen to marry by the ease they acquire in exchange for their industry Let us turn our thoughts for a moment to the negroes to the savages of Louisiana Luxury does not devour these people and yet are they numerous On the other hand how populous was Spain under the dominion of the Moors and yet what people were ever more brave or more luxurious  So far from Luxury's depopulating a State if there be any thing to fear from it it is that it will introduce an enormous population It is the fate of sublunary things to fall away by the very causes that promoted their progress The sources of the prosperity of a State corrupt it in the end where a prudent administration does not direct and conduct its course Emulation produced by Luxury and by the security of property gives birth to a prodigious  abundance and from this abundance springs a still more prodigious population the number of the human race in a country being always in proportion as was before observed to the productions which that country furnishes for the use of man Of course if no steps are taken to prevent an excess of population it becomes an evil  For where the inhabitants are too numerous every other interest except that of obtaining a livelihood is silent all progress in the sciences the fine arts and even the more mechanical ones stops no one thinks either of glory honour or happiness every one looks about to support existence and to obtain the means all methods are judged right Necessity compels it Men become crafty subtle and fraudulent The mind is enervated as the spirits relax and a nation which had raised itself to the highest degree of power and happiness is no more by a natural concatenation of causes and effects than a nation exceedingly numerous sordid wretched and low Excess of population has brought China to this fatal point  It is in this sense only that we can say with reason that Luxury is dreadful but here Providence steps in again and frequently interposes May it not be owing to an interference of the Creator that wars are kindled between neighbouring powers as much to thin the number of the human species as for other purposes If so a long war may in the end benefit a state which excess of population might otherwise ruin May not the great number of people that are carried off in Turkey by the plague be an effect of the wisdom of that same Providence who thus wisely provides against the too great increase of the species that might there arise from a plurality of wives May not their doctrine of predestination which forbids them to fly from the pestilence tend also to this end May not emigrations also have the same tendency But this is diving into causes beyond our reach to fathom all that is necessary to our present purpose is not to meet misfortunes half way but to act as consummate prudence shall direct and leave the event to Heaven  There are doubtless proper remedies to moderate excess of population so as to prevent any evil arising from Luxury The States of Switzerland lend out their troops to foreign nations for hire for that country being improved to the highest degree of cultivation after retaining a sufficient number of hands to keep it always in this condition and for the support of every manufactory they deem it political from the great surplus of inhabitants to allow their troops to go into foreign services lest an excess of population should prove injurious to the nation These troops by stipulation may be recalled by the States on any emergency which secures their internal defence But how far is the rest of Europe from having any thing to dread on this account Would to God it was threatened with it Before Luxury can injure a people it must lead them to the very height of prosperity and it must appear that no previous steps have been taken to render this prosperity lasting Let us not hesitate then to encourage Luxury in spite of the evil which a course of time may draw with it We think  ourselves justifiable in taking little or no account of a future evil which the actual situation of things place at an infinite distance which a thousand new causes may dissipate for ever and which can only be the result of a very long prosperity for the blessings of which it is wise to run an uncertain chance of a subsequent injury  The Luxury of a town is an incontestible proof of the opulence of its inhabitants Luxury spread to the smallest hamlets of a kingdom is a certain sign that such kingdom enjoys the greatest abundance Luxury ever takes its level from the public prosperity It is its thermometer In vain do our desires lead us to enjoyments that present themselves when our circumstances will not permit us to embrace them Our expences are always confined to things within our reach It is either my own property or the property of others who entrust me that I consumeIn both these cases it is ever some existing property which enables me to purchase a Luxury If I exceed my means my part is soon played The dissipation of my fortune is immediately succeeded  by want and humiliation Thus where Luxury reigns there is certainly a degree of opulence proportionable to the extent of it The aggregate of means may be greater than the consumption but it cannot be less Whatever excess an individual may run into he consumes only things that exist and things which would be consumed by others if they were not by him  Why then be alarmed at Luxury and consider it as a scourge since a people cannot give way to it but in proportion to their means Is it not consonant to reason to indulge where it can lawfully be done Wealth would be of little or no advantage were we forbidden to enjoy the comforts it brings We spend only in Luxuries that which Government leaves and when its necessary wants are supplied ought to leave What inconveniencies then can a State feel by its subjects expending that in the comforts and indulgences of life which it has no right to take from them and which it could not take without injuring itself  That Luxury has been declaimed against for many ages I allow  soevior armis luxuria  is an old reproach But men however they may applaud invectives against it have ever given into it and to the utmost of their power That good sense with which nature has endowed them keeps them from following in practice the errors of speculation In all ages men have indulged themselves in Luxuries fearless of the dangers they annexed to such a proclivity Nay though since the time of Juvenal Luxury has extended itself from Italy to France to England and to Germany these countries almost deserted in many places of old are now very powerful States Thus it appears in opposition to all opinions that the happiness and prosperity of men depend upon the indulgences of life and that Luxury is by no means a political evil  That which nature loves  says Young  is necessarily good  We do not consider that every fetter with which we shackle either trade or industry is a step towards circumscribing public prosperity What object would trade and industry have if it was not for Luxury Should you observe an empire falling into decay in some parts of which Luxury reigns  attribute not its ruin to the expenditure of individuals but extend your view further and you will find it owing to exorbitant taxes to tyranny to that want of perception in policy which discourages labour and every where obstructs the resources of power  A spirit of Luxury may corrupt and disgrace individuals We have given it the term of  dissuasor honesti  A love of riches will do the same but does it follow that riches are prejudicial to a State Woe be to them whose desires are not bounded by reason and honour They deserve every censure but call not  that  a vice which centres wholly in the person abusing it Will you like Mahomet prohibit the use of wine because this salutary drink intoxicates the intemperate  The expenditure of Government is the only thing whose excess can be detrimental to the State because the taxes Administration is obliged to levy and which must be paid exceeding the proportion which the general circumstances of the people can answer without affecting them rob them of  their necessary means of support or of increasing their income and is therefore a general discouragement Whereas the expences of individuals as excessive as they may be with respect to themselves are always confined to a certain circle so that the populace in general are not affected thereby  If Luxury had a destructive effect what would be the present state of things Men for some thousands years have indulged themselves in it as far as they could Their eagerness to do so never gives way but when their means fail them Though we at this day inveigh so bitterly against these excesses we see not among us such men as Lucullus and Apicius  Romans famed for Luxury  The most superb buildings of the present age do not reach the magnificence of the palace of Semiramis and our most studied entertainments do not equal those of Cleopatra Neither London nor Paris know either in common life or in public pleasures such refinements as were in general use in Babylon Athens and Rome at the time of their splendour  Even our ancestors as they grew wealthy those ancestors of whose simplicity we boast were as fond of magnificence and splendor as the Greeks and Romans  In this country people of moderate fortune in common life covered their tables with a great variety of dishes Cloaths were rich to that degree that according to an ancient Chronicle commencing in and ending in valets in imitation of their masters and the lower class of people indifferently wore doublets of silk and velvet  The Author of an English Tract called  a Plan of Trade  which ran through five editions in a very little time proposed as a means of augmenting the trade of this country to send missionaries to the Negroes and Savages of America not to propagate the faith but to induce them to clothe themselves and inspire them with a taste for Luxuries His idea is that if we could once bring them to adopt our customs they would apply themselves more to work in order to gratify their new desires that they would unite themselves more together multiply and become rich that of course  there would be among them a greater number of people in a situation to buy and whom we might furnish with a variety of articles No one can deny this way of reasoning to be just and that the effects which such a plan promises would take place could we bring the Savage nations to adopt our manners Every one also must allow that Savages could not follow our modes of dress build themselves houses more commodious than their present cabbins and furnish them with conveniences without such novelties being to them Luxuries though at the same time these additional comforts and conveniences should not exceed those of our common peasantry In fact Savages  have  reached these improvements and as the Luxury into which they have entered begins to enrich them by inducing them to work which is the source of all riches how should Luxury have a contrary effect among us where the force of this reasoning is much greater as with us work of all kinds is more readily entered into and meets with more encouragement  than among a people just emerging from the primitive state of Nature  Let us suppose for a while that the greatest part of Luxuries was abolished and let us consider the effects of such a change Men thenceforth would content themselves with cabbins whose construction would require no art and these would be very scantily and very clumsily furnished They would clothe themselves in skins and would have no utensils but such as are immediately necessaryFrom the moment they were restrained in this point half the inhabitants would be reduced to look out for new resources and those who have estates in land embarrassed with their incomes would be at a loss how to spend them The arts being abandoned an infinite quantity of different materials would become of no value Commerce would cease between country and country between town and town ships of trade would be useless and neither business nor interest would urge men to travel of course roads would be neglected and fall to ruin communications would be obstructed correspondence would cease and as in former  times it would be a great undertaking to go forty miles to see a friend  From this failure in the arts from this failure in communication ignorance and barbarism would undoubtedly spring Hence also those who are employed in husbandry having fewer resources and less knowledge would attend less to their business and their harvest of course would be smaller Each district thus confined and limited to its own resources would decline under the intemperature of seasons and famine as in ancient times would stalk abroad  The nation almost reduced for provisions to the harvest of the year and having neither money in store nor any other wealth would not be in a situation to pay for any thing but in kind or in labour Hence the State would be under a necessity of demanding the personal service even of landholders and hence would follow as substitutes for them the servitude or vassalage of the lower class of men employed by the landholders for want of responsible men to occupy their lands This obligation of personal  service would deprive the State of a standing army and consequently reduce its fate in time of war to the hazard of a single battle  In tracing the inevitable consequences of an extinction of Luxury we should find ourselves in the situation of our ancestors during the feudal system when the lord's rents were paid in labour and military services were performed in person Wars were then carried on rather by excursions than regular campaigns a single defeat decided the fate of the vanquished and ignorance and barbarism were complete Now an extinction of Luxury whether brought on by wars by continual disasters or by prohibitory laws would equally produce the same effects It would destroy emulation put a stop to industry annihilate wealth and bring a country into the same situation as would a poverty caused by the ravages of a continual intestine war or the vices of a bad administration  The history of other countries besides our own will shew the superiority of strength and power which Luxury and its  offspring the arts give birth to in a nation Caesar with a small number of troops in ten years subjected the Gauls a brave and disciplined people but who lived in the greatest simplicity and consequently were not wealthy or acquainted with the value of the arts The Romans then masters of Gaul carried Luxury from Italy into this new province The country became rich and flourishing The barbarians from Germany and the North attracted by the opulence of these Gauls poured in upon them like a deluge But these being as simple and as little luxurious as the ancient Gauls they were repulsed and kept back for three hundred years without being able to obtain any other establishment than as subjects of the empire nor could they find a sovereignty there till after they had taken up the arts and manners of the Romans  Administrations are apt to think that they have only to lay taxes upon the inhabitants of a country to oblige them to work This was the spirit of that device which the council of finances established by the regent of France in took for a coat of arms  viz  a plough furrowing a field with the motto  secat et auget  But in this Governors are mistaken for if they only leave cultivators in possession of means sufficient to carry on their husbandry and pay their taxes they discourage them and in a little time taxes are not paid at all To enable them to pay a tax and to add to it from year to year if occasion requires care must be taken to put no check to industry which cannot be avoided any other way than by leaving such persons a residue of their gains at their own disposal after the tax is paid in order to sweeten their toils reward their labour and encourage them to proceed Not only justice and humanity require this but policy The productions of the earth are always in proportion to labour and industry The husbandman however takes no pains but as he hopes to reap a profit by his labour What he consumes himself of the produce of his lands is not all that interests him His views are chiefly turned to the profits he shall otherwise gain To make a man work his whole life merely to support his existence would be as bad as condemning  him for life to the galleys or putting him on board the ballastlighters at Woolwich  Perhaps it may be said that we ought to contract the sphere of our wants Diogenes taught us this We enrich ourselves according to him in proportion as we learn to do without a great number of things When it shall be even true that abstinence with respect to the happiness of individuals is equally gratifying with enjoyments and that we shall gain more by saving ourselves the trouble of acquiring or preserving than we should lose by renouncing the advantages of possession this philosophy will not be less irreconcilable with public interest which requires that a State should be able to make itself respectable abroad as well as at home  In a nation accustomed to live upon a little the wants of the State are almost the same and cost as much as in a nation where superfluities are admitted Among the most luxurious people as well as among those who are least so soldiers and sailors employed by the State are paid nearly alike that is to say at as low a rate as possible so  as to afford them existence The same works require the same quantity of materials and if the conductors of public undertakings are better paid by a luxurious people the assistance such a people derive from the arts which flourish among them counterbalances the extraordinary sums paid and upon a calculation renders the expence less to them than it would be to a less luxurious and of course a poorer nation though paying smaller sums of money A nation then whose individuals contract their expences and abridge their consumption advances as much to the public wants as a nation whose individuals live with less frugality Hence it is that among a people who mortify themselves by denying themselves indulgences the public expences cannot be adequate to the wants of the State without being excessive in comparison to the wants of individuals and that the excess of these public charges prevents such a nation providing for the wants of the State agreeable to the necessity of circumstances and consequently the State must continue  weak contemptible and subject to the invasion of the first aggressor  It will probably be objected that the charges of the State though excessive in proportion to the wants of individuals not being in reality heavier than they reasonably ought to be a head of a family contributes more easily to its support when he spends little upon himself and family than when he spends a great deal To give strength to this argument it must first be proved that men who scarce wish for any indulgence will exert themselves and encrease their labour without any other object than a very distant advantage derived from the benefits the State acquires and which is not very sensibly felt by individuals He who spends but little comforts himself with an easy life which in his opinion compensates for the loss of every other enjoyment It is not in human nature to exert itself and undergo fatigue without a prospect of reward This is a principle I have already explained and which should not be lost sight of  Let us admit for a moment contrary to all likelihood that among a people living a rigid life where Luxury is unknown patriotic zeal carried by education even to heroism encourages them cheerfully to supply the public wants though exceeding in a great disproportion the personal wants of the contributors Even under this supposition a nation with manners so respectable would still want solid stability A State cannot always foresee its necessities Accidental unthought of wants arise Suppose there is a sufficient store of arms ammunition and artillery An enemy in the course of an unfortunate war destroys the magazines Fire consumes them A thousand accidents may exhaust them In such a case then what resource would a people have that had reduced themselves to this simple life we have been speaking of None They would not repair such losses with that convenient expedition which the inhabitants of a country could who accustomed to enjoy an ample superfluity have stores of materials of every kind As they generally consume more than is necessary  they can easily spare in a case of distress sufficient to supply the necessities of the State And that which to each would be little or no deprivation when collected from a whole community would prove an essential assistance On the contrary in a country whose inhabitants consume but little there is but little reserve among individuals and as the inhabitants of this country confine their consumption almost to things immediately necessary they have nothing to spare Thus in such unfortunate and unexpected cases which defeat all foresight a nation who contracts its expences to the utmost would find itself ill provided and without means of defence Whatever zeal whatever courage we may suppose it to have it cannot avoid in the end being conquered and destroyed  Again Luxury is charged with corrupting the manners degrading the soul stifling of virtue introducing a thousand vices and by such effects working the ruin of States It is said also by the opposers of Luxury that the present race of men are not equal to what their ancestors were and that the  human species is degenerating Now it is two thousand years that this language has been held and yet the experience of twenty centuries which has given the lie to such declarations has not been able to stop their mouths  History by no means confirms such an opinion of Luxury Let us look back and run through the last five centuries From the year to the present time Luxury has not ceased to be prevalent in France I point to that country as we seem to draw our manners as well as our fashions from thence and at certain periods in this interval of time with more profusion than at this day Since this however the French monarchy has certainly not diminished its grandeur No revolution has happened for five hundred years past in any part of Europe that we can with any shadow of truth attribute to a depravation of manners occasioned by Luxury If we except the taking of Constantinople by the Turks and the expulsion of the Moors from Spain events whose real cause like those of all other public events which we attribute to  the effect of Luxury upon manners have no relation to it whatever if we except I say these two cases the principal states that have divided Europe for five hundred years past continue still to divide it with little difference in their boundaries notwithstanding a very great degree of Luxury was introduced into some of these States before this epoch and has continued there ever since Where then is the devastation caused by Luxury And since in spite of its effects for so long a space of time these great empires have nearly preserved the same extent of territory how can we maintain that a spirit of Luxury alters the manners so as to be prejudicial to the preservation of States And it is even observable that the most powerful of those empires are those where Luxury has reigned the most  It has been often said that corruption of manners overthrew the Roman power and it has been very wantonly said Rome began to give way to Luxury one hundred and fifty years before the Christian aera yet in spite of a very corrupt form of government established among the Romans by Augustus the  empire supported itself without any diminution three hundred years after the birth of Christ It continued to exist in the west till the end of the year and in the east under the name of the Grecian Empire to the year This duration reckoning from the introduction of Luxury into Rome is a space of years How absurd is it then to quote empires as seated upon ruinous foundations which subsisted for so long a time The notion that Luxury was destructive to the Roman power took its rise from considering the revolution in Rome under Julius Caesar as the termination of the Roman empire No such change however took place in its form of government then as had frequently done before since the time of Romulus  Besides if Luxury could ever be supposed to have injured the Roman power which I cannot any way admit the example will not hold good at present The Romans were a warlike people insatiate for extent of empire which could only be acquired by the sword Indulgence therefore to a warrior may naturally be supposed to enervate his  arm and make him less fit for enterprize than when inured to danger and fatigue So great was their thirst for dominion that no boundary would serve them but that of the whole world They were a people bred up to arms and from a savage state laboured to overrun the whole globe Luxury to such a people might counteract their designs for growing less hardy and resolute from indulgence the barbarians from the north poured in upon them and destroyed them The complexion and system of the times is very different now  Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis  Future ages may as well say that it was the luxury of the English that lost them America As the dismemberment of the Roman empire was chiefly owing to their vast extent of territory too remote from its seat and too populous to be controlled at such a distance so was the separation of North America from us It were idle to suppose that such an extent of country so well peopled and at so great a distance would continue long subject to the control of this island Had not the event taken place now  it would certainly have done so in less than half a century But to return to my subject territory is at this day in a greater number of hands states are more divided nations more civilized and that hardy roughness of former ages is not so necessary now If a State has a sufficient soldiery to bear its part in the scale of Europe in proportion to its extent of domain it requires no more It is not the system of modern States to aim as did the Romans at extent of territory by conquest Their wish is only to enrich the country they at present possess to render themselves as powerful as their nature and situation will admit of and to defend themselves from encroachments and if at any time they stand in need of assistance neighbouring States are ready to lend their aid in order to preserve a balance of power lest any one State should become too powerful for the rest As things therefore now stand any enervation of savage strength any softness of manners brought on by Luxury is so far from being injurious to States that it renders them more civilized more friendly and more conformable  to that mildness of disposition with which Providence hath humanized mankind  On a supposition that the attraction of indulgences opening the bosom to desire disposes men to neglect their duty and deadens the voice of conscience we should expect to find less virtue in a country where Luxury predominates than where the people live a more simple life for under this idea we must suppose that in a nation living in a simple manner there are fewer objects capable of inflaming desire and consequently fewer occasions where a wish for gratification carries men beyond the bounds they ought to keep But the fact is not so  Let a nation live either splendidly or poorly it is equally exposed to those disorders which desire draws after it Passions derive their strength more from the disposition of the heart than from the variety or value of those things that inflame them Envy jealousy ambition vanity all the affections of the soul that give birth to desire are alive to small objects when great ones do not present themselves There was nothing rare or of any great value in Lacedemon  The people there coveted trifles Tarpeia in the early time of Rome that is to say at the time when Rome was poor delivered up the capital to the enemies of her country for an object that would not here tempt any person of her rank  All is comparative What is nothing in one circumstance is every thing in another A Negro Prince sets as great a value on the feathers that encircle his head as does the Mogul on the diamonds that decorate his throne  Luxuries do not inflame desire nor make us exceed the bounds prescribed but when we covet or regret them from a motive independent of the pleasures attached to the enjoyment What is the motive that leads us to wish immediately for the means of living luxuriously The ambition of surpassing or equalling the situation of our fellowcitizens of eclipsing them and thus obtaining a certain degree of credit it is the fear of falling into contempt and too often the danger that arises from not appearing opulent I am sorry to say it but it is the misfortune in the present age to  rate men not so much by their intrinsic merits as by the appearance they make in life and as most people covet the esteem of the world they as I said before endeavour to make the best appearance they can though in order to make such appearance they spend more than they can afford We covet not the favours of fortune merely for the pleasures of indulgence but for the gratification of displaying our wealth and in many cases for the prospect of encreasing it The covetous man who sacrifices his honour his repose his every thing to the encrease of his riches and who is then prodigal of these same riches in luxurious expences is scarce ever a sensual man Vanity is the only thing that animates him or the greedy hope of adding to his wealth encreasing his power and gaining authority It is not Luxury but the semblance of it  Vanity acts upon the mind in proportion to the object this passion has in view and not according to the means we employ to gratify it Thus wherever vanity springs it has the same influence whether its object be  trifles or things of greater magnitude Now in whatever manner a nation lives as soon as it admits of property there will necessarily be differences in fortune and in the expences of individuals and of course on account of these differences vanity and desire will take a certain lead in such a nation whether it be less luxurious or more so Don't we observe in villages that a very little expence which one inhabitant enters into more than another in order to support his family creates as much jealousy and longing as the eclat of the greatest Luxury can excite in an opulent capital Among the peasantry he who possesses a little flock of sheep and a cow or two is thought rich by his companions and townsmen who look upon him with an envious eye and who covet his happy situation as much as others do the wealth and splendor of those above them  The more dignity rank and distinction take place in polished nations whatever system they follow with regard to Luxury the greater is the degree of desire common to all However true it may be that where  Luxury is unknown temptations are fewer the nation which prohibits indulgences is not on that account free from covetousness or venality for by an effect constantly proceeding from the nature of man his desires when he is able only to exercise them on a small number of objects actuate him more eagerly than when he can exercise them on a greater number  It does not appear then that our manners would improve by a voluntary contraction of our wants nor that we should expect more virtue in a country whose inhabitants live hard than in one where they lead a more comfortable life Among both one and the other passions rise from the same basis and are actuated by the same or equal incitements  If we cast our eyes over the different nations that cover the earth and look back to what history teaches us of past ages we shall discover more outrageousness more rebellious actions and in general manners less civilized in times when the conveniences and indulgences of life were never coveted than in those where they were  most studied Reason teaches us this A desire for indulgences leads to dissipation and induces men freely to communicate with each other By this communication the mind accustomed to wandering is less susceptible of strong passions and the necessity of studying continually to please those with whom we communicate habitually serves to soften the temper and polish the manners All these circumstances prove that men in an opulent nation enjoying their opulence are naturally more mild moderate and less disposed to commit crimes of any magnitude  Let us examine into the lower class of people in our own country Those who compose it have no superfluities nor have they any wish to obtain them They are absolutely so much out of their reach that they never think of them Now what are the manners of these people Let us compare them with the manners of those who live at their ease who have already in a certain degree tasted the sweets of Luxury and who with a view of encreasing their enjoyments are strongly tempted to encrease  their fortune May we not say and with truth too that the manners of the middle class of people exceed in goodness those of the lower class  Our attributing to Luxury such a change of manners as is injurious to public prosperity rises from want of discernment We do not properly distinguish between those manners that are sufficient to form the happiness of society and those which rigid rectitude prescribes Our ideas of civil morality are far from being precise and we are too apt to confound it with that which is speculative There is however in matters of policy a great deal of difference between the two  Speculative morality tends to guide us by a pure and disinterested love of rectitude or to detach us from temporal things by directing our views to those which are eternal Considering actions in themselves independent of all relation to society and connected only with the rules of perfection it will not admit of any deviation What I call civil morality which has no object but to sweeten and secure the commerce of  men among themselves and to maintain good public order requires not a strict observation of all its precepts but admits of every relaxation consistent with the peace and prosperity of Society In judging then of the manners of a people by the principles of speculative morality we shall find that a spirit of Luxury in certain persons too worldlyminded to be sensible of the value of perfect purity weakens the practice and authority of some of its doctrines But in judging of manners by the principles of civil morality we shall see nothing pernicious in these relaxations suggested by a spirit of Luxury whilst they trouble not the harmony of society or impede the motion of its springs  In fact the political machine rolls on without embarrassment notwithstanding these irregularities Why then should we be in pain about them They are attended with no bad consequences and the cause which produces them produces also a thousand important advantages But this is saying too little Without a spirit of Luxury among the people as I have already observed  society would not only languish but even be annihilated Luxury is the tie that unites men together Of what use then are all our invectives against it To what purpose is it to rail at a thing which cannot be dispensed withThere are great inconveniences attending the necessity of eating and yet the most eloquent pen cannot induce us to refrain from this necessity but we eat on still and must eat whilst we live  Vainly will you pretend to make a distinction between Ease and Luxury Where will you draw the line How will you determine it for every class of men and for every individual in each class You have no principles capable of guiding you in this matter Scarcely shall you point out the essentials for one or two classes of people but you will find yourself obliged to renounce the task and confess that in things made use of by men there are in fact but two kinds  Luxuries  and  Necessaries  Principles of virtue are doubtless necessary in a nation Vices lead to its ruin A State cannot subsist nor have any power but by an attention to the duties of society  All the vices however and all the virtues do not equally interest the preservation of an empire All social obligations are not so strict as to admit of no extension There are even violations and very common ones that no way attack the public prosperity A system of morality adopted by a numerous people is not in all its points equally essential to every individual The wellbeing of a little nation requires a stricter obedience to some certain precepts which without any bad consequences may be neglected by a great number of people in a nation more considerable  The object of men uniting in a  State  is very different from that of men uniting in a  Cloister  The attention of the first is directed to the present life their view is to render their time here easy tranquil and pleasant the other think only of a future life and study to secure their happiness hereafter These last cannot impose too severe a discipline whereas the first prescribe and obey rules which tend to their temporal interest leaving every individual to judge  for himself with respect to his eternal interest according to his conscience  Severity or restraint of manners and domestic regularity are certainly very praiseworthy Far be it from me to depreciate the merit of these virtues But comfortable and profitable as they are to those who observe them with regard to the prosperity of a kingdom they have not that importance that is attributed to them When once the principles of probity and honour are so generally practised and respected in a nation as to secure the common good morality has done all that policy requires It must look to other sources for the happiness and power of a people Now what are these sources Physical means the unfolding and exertion of the faculties both of mind and body ingenuity in the arts of peace and war capacity in business an enlightened patriotism that is to say a spirit of policy From these it is that public prosperity is principally derived These are the objects to which a good citizen should direct his attention Their importance  will draw every other necessary after them  There have indeed existed some small nations who though given up to a voluntary or constrained poverty have nevertheless performed some great exploits in war but we must not conclude that to be as illustrious as them we should live as they did It must be observed that their success was not owing to their poverty but to the enthusiasm of their virtues produced by the education they received to the attention they gave to their affairs to their application to the use of arms and that their poverty was an obstacle which they had the greatest difficulty to surmount We must observe also that their rivals were not very powerful that for the most part they lived as hard as their enemies and that where the conquerors and the conquered led the same kind of life it is not in the manner of living that we must look up for the cause of victory  Besides triumphs in war do not prove the good morals of a people The Buccaneers who made the new world tremble  and who in the rashest enterprizes performed prodigies of valour were banditti The Tartars who conquered China were robbers What was Pizarro and his associates who conquered Peru They subdued and massacred an inoffensive people habituated to the practice of social virtues To conquer it is sufficient to know the art of war better and employ it better than the enemy Nothing is more foreign to the purity of manners It is not in camps in the midst of licentiousness and military barbarity that we learn to regulate them  We quote often the Romans and the Spartans as if the Romans were powerful during the time they lived hard and as if the Spartans otherwise surrounded than they were would have been able in keeping up their poverty to have rendered themselves formidable to their neighbours or even to have preserved themselves  Every time that these old examples are brought to prove that a disposition to spend money and a desire for various enjoyments are prejudicial to a State as tending to the extinction of virtue how is it that so  striking an observation is not in some degree a check to us The people of Greece did not cultivate the arts give into magnificence or study pleasure so much as the Athenians and yet the history of the Athenians furnishes more renowned sayings more glorious actions and more illustrious achievements both public and private than that of the Spartans of whose severity in living so much boast is made  Among the illustrious men of Plutarch and Cornelius Nepos there are six Lacedemonians and fifteen Athenians To these may be added Socrates and Plato of whom Plutarch and Cornelius Nepos are silent they having been neither commanders of armies nor public ministers though they are not less illustrious on that account Among the six Lacedemonians are Pausanias and Lysander who though able men and renowned for valiant exploits were far from being good men  The manners of the Spartans though brilliant in certain respects were in general very bad Enthusiasm carried them beyond  all example but sober reason condemned them  Good morals considered only as they respect society and without any view of a life to come like civil morals are of greater value in proportion as they render men happy on this side the grave Morals or manners in this light are better or worse as they encrease or diminish the happiness of the people This is the touchstone by which we should judge of them  The Spartans were brave and valiant inflamed with the love of their country and of liberty but they were perfidious ungrateful envious arrogant eager to rule unjust inhuman and often mean Their society yielded them neither comforts pleasure nor security Such is the idea we are taught to conceive of this people from ancient history  But let us not revert to former ages All there is too much enveloped in obscurity The facts of those times as far as they concern us stand single and are few in number They cannot be sufficiently known in their detail nor as they relate to the causes of the misery or prosperity of those nations  to which they belong so as to give any countenance to political systems at this day We ought not to form our ideas on such uncertain grounds lest fatal errors should be the consequence  Modern times afford us facts more certain and conclusive We inhabit a kingdom and we have neighbouring States where Luxury has a long time reigned We see not Sparta in Italy in France or in England and yet are these countries less illustrious in war or in peace To look back but two hundred years have they not produced renowned generals celebrated writers able ministers enlightened magistrates and very distinguished inventors and artists What bravery what abilities what greatness of soul what fortitude what ingenuity what disinterestedness may we not trace in this space of time among the inhabitants of these countries such as would do honour to ancient Greece or ancient Rome How many noble and brilliant actions are lost in the crowd of which we are still ignorant  Since these powerful nations then exist where a spirit of Luxury is limited only by the means or by the fortune of a people and among whom we find these moral qualities essential to the support of these States since these nations flourish for certainly England France and Italy may be said to flourish in contradistinction to Spain where the inhabitants live upon onions to Sweden where there are sumptuary laws and to Poland where the people go almost naked it must be allowed that a desire for enjoyments in changing the manners do not render them worse or that policy in not curbing this desire rectifies its bad effects so as not to leave it prejudicial to the State  Extension of enjoyments has nothing in itself incompatible with innocence and virtue It is more consonant to true wisdom to profit by the blessings of nature than to refuse them Useful virtues are more practicable in opulence than in poverty and hardness of living necessarily leads to poverty as a spirit of Luxury in exercising all the faculties leads commonly to opulence If opulence gives facility to follow  a vicious inclination poverty fostering ignorance and coarseness of manners encourages and strengthens other vices more pernicious and odious Let us dwell no longer on the comparison We are certainly not to look for the good or evil morals of a people in their modes of living  Manners take their rise from the constitution of government and the tenets spread throughout a nation respecting all the objects that interest it When the tenets which a nation follow are sound when its constitution is wise then whether the people be luxurious or not their manners are good they practise the virtues and administration adding punishments and rewards to the strength of the general opinion vice finds so many barriers and so few advantages that the number of the vicious is always too small or the kind of vices of too little consequence to injure the security of the State  The tenets of a nation respecting the objects that interest it and the constitution of its government depend upon the manner in which it has been instructed Manners then primarily depend upon education  Inculcate the principles of honour justice and virtue by a good education support them not on false or confused notions but upon sound and clear ideas let your pupils be well inspired with this great maxim  N'usurpe point et respectetoi  a maxim more precise than the ancient proverb so well known  Do not to others what you would not have them do unto you  take care by your form of government to make it the common interest to keep up to this principle and you will acknowledge that the enjoyments of Luxury innocent in themselves will never corrupt a purity of manners  The influence of education is allpowerful Religions are propagated and supported by instruction Give a free flight to literature encourage the liberty of the press let no constraint stifle the voice of those men who devoted to study reflect for mankind and enrich the world with the fruits of their genius and all the reformations necessary for the public good will break out one after another without confusion and without trouble Should error get hold of  some minds and extend itself by means of such liberty of the press a thousand opposers would by that same liberty rise against it The sun of criticism and discussion will dissipate every cloud and nothing will gain an establishment which does not bear the seal of reason and of truth  In short whatever may be said of the influence of Luxury on the manners of the people as men associate only to procure themselves enjoyments and as the attraction to such enjoyments is the sole source of the power and happiness of society it must be consulted though the morals of the Public were in some measure to be affected thereby If temporal utility be merely considered such morals as are consistent with a spirit of Luxury are sufficiently good since society cannot exist without Luxury any more than without morality and as societies the support of which is the sole end of civil morality have not only existed for many ages but have been more happy more numerous and more powerful in proportion to the degree of Luxury among them where the nature of their government  has not frustrated the advantages derived from this source  Upon the whole in countries where Luxury is predominant we see a vast number of towns an infinite population good order existing and nature embellished to the utmost on the contrary in those new climates where the industry of man still enveloped leaves him but little exertion for superfluities the best soils are but boundless desarts Nature presents but a shapeless scene her riches are thinly scattered and lost in the confusion while the human species small in number wandering in the forests submitting to the inclemency of seasons and often pining under the horrors of want is in its happiest moments obliged to contend with every animal for subsistence  Though a spirit of Luxury has bene commonly accused as the scourge of States an examination of its effects has given me a very different idea An extinction or even a great diminution of Luxury would in my opinion bring on misery barbarism and an immense depopulation and in a commercial  State like ours involved in a vast national debt the interest of which can be paid only by its Luxuries total ruin On the other hand free Luxury under a wellordered government appears to me to be attended with plenty wealth and public happiness These ideas too much unknown till now strike me with their importance I have ventured to declare them and if these best intentions may in any degree recommend a work mine has a claim to the attention of every thinking man  Careful and diligent as I may have been like other men I am not secure against illusion I hope however I am entitled to indulgence When a man thinks himself able to destroy a fatal opinion he is commendable in the attempt nay he is not allowed to be silent  Si quid novisti rectius istis  Candidus imperti Si non his utere mecum  FINIS  Of the Publisher of this Tract may be had
