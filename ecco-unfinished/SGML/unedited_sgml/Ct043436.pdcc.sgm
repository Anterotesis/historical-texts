<HEAD>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE, GEORGE EARL of <HI>CARDIGAN</HI>, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ENcourag'd by Your Lord&s;hip's Permi&s;&s;ion, I pre&s;ume to in|&s;cribe Your Name to the fol|lowing Sheets. The Author of them, Sir <HI>Richard Bul&s;trode</HI>, was de&s;cended from a very ancient Family, to an Heire&s;s of which one of Your Lord|&s;hip's Ance&s;tors was marry'd, and the <HI>Bul&s;trodes</HI> now living have Rea&s;on to
<PB REF="3">
acknowledge it, as they do, to be no &s;mall Honour to them, that the Earl of CARDIGAN quarters their Arms.</P>
<P>My Lord, it would be next to im|pertinent to tell the World what they &s;ufficiently know already; that Your Lord&s;hip derives Your De&s;cent from a Race truly Noble, as well for the Length of their Duration, as for the Honours our Kings, in Reward of their Services, at &s;everal times conferr'd on them. They have for many Ages been Great in Title, and Good a|bove Greatne&s;s. Their Inclinations and Endeavours were the general Good of Mankind: They delighted in obliging others, and were pleas'd to &s;ee them pleas'd with their Bounty: They have been renown'd for relie|ving Merit in Want, and for &s;uccou|ring Vertue in Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other Vertues &s;eem an Inheritance in Your Lord&s;hip, and deriv'd from Your Ance&s;tors with Your Blood. My Lord, I cannot be
<PB REF="4">
guilty of Flattery if I would, nor needs there any Trial of Skill to &s;hew how I can prai&s;e: Nature has done it to my Hands, and repre&s;ented fai|rer Ideas than I can de&s;cribe: She has endow'd You with all her Ble&s;&s;ings; with a Gracefulne&s;s of Per&s;on, Ex|cellence of Under&s;tanding, Largene&s;s of Heart, with Integrity, and Ju&s;tice of Principles, with Humanity, Affa|bility, and many other Qualities, far above my De&s;cription, and that would &s;ecure me from the Cen&s;ure of Flat|tery, even though I &s;hould launch into a Panegyrick.</P>
<P>Fortune too, my Lord, in your Regard, has been more wi&s;e than u|&s;ual: for &s;he frequently honours and enriches others to her own Di&s;grace; but &s;he participates in the Prai&s;e, and commends her own Wi&s;dom, in what &s;he has be&s;tow'd on Your Lord&s;hip: Wealth is of &s;ome Value in Your Hands; and &s;o good an U&s;e is made of Your great E&s;tate, that even Envy
<PB REF="5">
does not wi&s;h it le&s;s. Be pleas'd, my Lord, to give me leave to &s;peak to You in the Words of <HI>Horace</HI>, which are &s;o ju&s;tly applicable to Your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<Q><L>Non Tu Corpus eras &s;ine Pectore: Dii Tibi Formam,</L>
<L><HI>Dii Tibi Divitias dederunt</HI>, artemque fruendi.</L></Q>
<P>But I come to beg Protection, not to give Prai&s;e: And my greate&s;t Am|bition, which I be&s;eech Your Lord|&s;hip to pardon, is, to &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf, with the mo&s;t profound Sub|mi&s;&s;ion and Re&s;pect,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE mo&s;t of the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> have been engag'd in Wars, how dif|ficult it has been to come at the true Knowledge of publick Occurrences, is evident from the different Relations, that have been given us of them; one would al|mo&s;t think, that we had not only engag'd in Leagues and Confederacies again&s;t one ano|ther, but that all of us in general were en|ter'd into one Grand Alliance, and had una|nimou&s;ly declar'd War again&s;t the Truth of Hi&s;tory: So artfully di&s;ingenuous have we &s;hewn our &s;elves in extenuating, di&s;gui&s;ing, and concealing our own Lo&s;&s;es, and in mag|nifying, mi&s;repre&s;enting, and publi&s;hing tho&s;e of the adver&s;e Party. Had the Common Ene|my been &s;even Years ago brought to that low Condition, to which it was then indu&s;triou&s;ly given out that he was, when it was even
<PB REF="7">
made a Mark of Di&s;affection to &s;ugge&s;t or believe the contrary, we &s;hould not at this Day be thus divided in Opinion concerning a &s;afe and honourable Peace, nor perplex'd with the Uncertainty, whether it were best to en|ter into a Treaty upon the Preliminaries now offer'd us.</P>
<P>But this Mi&s;repre&s;entation of the true Po|&s;ture of Affairs may be &s;o far indulg'd and excus'd, in that it may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure pro|ceed from a political Rea&s;on of State; eve|ry Potentate concern'd being de&s;irous, nay, deeming it of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, to keep up the almost dejected Hearts of their di&s;pirited Va&s;&s;als, and to in&s;pire them with fre&s;h Cou|rage, by giving them every Year repeated Hopes of a &s;peedy End of this bloody, expen|&s;ive, and con&s;equently de&s;tructive War. This, perhaps, may have been the chief Rea&s;on, for I can di&s;cover no other, that may have induc'd &s;ome of the Princes, who are now engag'd in Arms, to connive at the great number of &s;currilous lying Pamphlets, as well News-Papers as others, and to permit them to be publi&s;h'd and &s;pread abroad through|out all their Dominions, impunibly and with|out the lea&s;t Controul. I have ob&s;erv'd, and any one who has read the Relations they have given us, with the least, that is, with more Attention than they de&s;erve, may have done &s;o too, that all the Actions, which, du|ring
<PB REF="8">
the whole Cour&s;e of this War, have hap|pen'd between the Armies abroad, have been related in the &s;ame manner, nay, almo&s;t in the &s;ame Words. So mi&s;erably are the&s;e pi|tiful. Scriblers put to their &s;hifts for new Words, and a fre&s;h manner of Lying, to fill up the length of their Papers. With them, the beaten Party is very mode&s;t if he lay not Claim to the Victory, or at least to a drawn Battel; for, excepting in the Battels of <HI>Landen</HI> and <HI>Turin</HI>, where, the Advantages were &s;o great as to &s;trike the Eyes of the mo&s;t Incredulous, and to leave &s;carce any Room for Di&s;gui&s;e, he has always kill'd as many of the Enemies, as he lo&s;t of his own Troops; or el&s;e he came off with little Lo&s;s, and made his Retreat in good Order: Be|&s;ides, were his Lo&s;s ever &s;o great, he has daily found it to be le&s;s than it was at first reported, by rea&s;on of the great Number of Soldiers that had been given over for kill'd or taken, but were continually coming back to the Camp. On the other Hand, he, who got the better of the Day, has never failed to magnify his Advantages proportionably: He has routed his Enemies to that Degree, that, as we were told, we had rea&s;on to believe, they would never be able to recruit their Armies, nor ever more &s;hew their Fa|ces in a Camp. To this wretched Plight have our Enemies been reduc'd at the end of
<PB REF="9">
&s;everal Campaigns; and yet the &s;ucceeding Spring has beheld this <HI>Hydra</HI>, with two Heads &s;prouted out in the room of one that was cut off; and we have met in the Field a more terrible Mon&s;ter to encounter. Their Narratives of other Matters of Fact are of the like Stamp, and I appeal to any impar|tial Per&s;on what Credit is to be given to them. The Governments them&s;elves have, no doubt, had more authentick Advices; tho', as I hinted before, they have, for certain Rea|&s;ons of State, &s;uffer'd the&s;e Impo&s;itions to be <HI>Po&s;t-Man'd</HI> and <HI>Po&s;t-Boy'd</HI> upon the Pub|lick. And with this Encouragement the&s;e im|perfect and lying Relations are bungled and patch'd up together, and pa&s;s currently with &s;ome, for what they fal&s;ely and &s;candalou&s;ly call them&s;elves, <HI>The Annals of the Reigns of our Sovereigns</HI>. But the&s;e impudent News-Writers &s;top not here, for they pre&s;ume to intrude into the Councils and Cabinets of Princes, and give the World an Account of what pa&s;&s;es, and is re&s;olv'd on there, as well in regard to our own Affairs as tho&s;e of Fo|reign States. An In&s;olence without Exam|ple, 'till of late Days.</P>
<P>Now, that the following Letters may not be thought to de&s;erve as little Credit as the Relations of which I have been &s;peaking; and that too the rather, becau&s;e they treat of Affairs of the &s;ame Nature; it will be
<PB REF="10">
nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, in a few Words, what they contain, and by whom, as well as to whom they were written.</P>
<P>First then, They were written in the Year <HI>1674</HI>, all of them, except two to Sir <HI>Robert Southwell</HI>, to the Earl of <HI>Arlington</HI>, then Secretary of State, by Sir <HI>Richard Bul&s;trode</HI>, who then re&s;ided at the Court of <HI>Bruxelles</HI>, as Agent for King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and they contain the Hi&s;tory of all the remarkable Tran&s;actions in the Low Countries, in <HI>Al|&s;atia</HI> and <HI>Burgundy</HI>, during the Campaign of that Year, when the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts, Spaniards</HI>, and <HI>Dutch</HI> were engag'd in War against the <HI>French</HI>. This was that Campaign in which was fought the memorable Battel of <HI>Seneff</HI>, between the Confederates under the Command of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>, and the Army of <HI>France</HI> commanded by the Prince of <HI>Conde;</HI> which I chu&s;e particularly to mention, that the Reader may take notice, that it is no new Cu&s;tom for both Sides to a&s;cribe to them&s;elves the Honour of the Victory; for they did &s;o even then, and made Rejoicings too every where for it. The&s;e Letters evidently &s;hew to which &s;ide it inclin'd, and whoever reads them will, I believe, be of Opinion, that this Relation of that Battel is the only impartial and true Account of it, that is yet any where extant. We may affirm the &s;ame too of the other Oc|currences that are here related; as of the
<PB REF="11">
Account of the Battel that happen'd the &s;ame Year on the Banks of the <HI>Neckar</HI>, between the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> and the <HI>French;</HI> the first of them commanded by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>, the last by Mar&s;hal <HI>Turenne;</HI> and al&s;o of the &s;everal Sieges, and other military Exploits of that Campaign; together, with all the &s;ecret Cabals and Intrigues of the then Court of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els;</HI> all which is the Subject of the&s;e Letters, which are written with &s;uch an Air of Candour, Integrity, and Impartiality, as plainly evinces them to be authentick, and would in a manner command our Belief, e|ven tho' we were ignorant of the Author.</P>
<P>As for the Style in which they are written, it is purely Epi&s;tolatory, &s;uch as one Gentleman writes off-hand to another, and &s;uch as best becomes Compo&s;ures of this Nature, when they are written as they ought to be: For they require not elaborate Elegancies, but &s;hould have only a native Clearne&s;s and Bre|vity; they &s;hould not con&s;i&s;t of ful&s;ome Com|pliments, but &s;hould have a re&s;pectful kind of Plainne&s;s and Familiarity, to affect only the Humour of tho&s;e to whom they are inten|ded. In Letters like the&s;e, the Souls of Men &s;hould appear undre&s;s'd, and in a negli|gent Habit, not trick'd up with artful Gaw|deries, or the &s;tudy'd Ornaments of Rheto|rick; and &s;uch I dare affirm the following Letters to be.</P>
<P><PB REF="12">As for the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Expre&s;&s;ions the Au|thor u&s;es in the Conclu&s;ion of his Letters, as that of <HI>Laying my &s;elf low at your Lord|&s;hip's Feet with all Zeal and Humility</HI>, it was a Compliment us'd by Gentlemen of the best Quality, one towards another in tho&s;e Times, tho' now laid a&s;ide; nay, I cou'd give In&s;tances of Sub&s;criptions more humble and abject in the Letters of &s;everal Envoys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ome of whom are now living, than are to be found any where in our Author.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary, in the next Place, to give &s;ome Account of our Author, that may &s;erve rather for the Information of his Rea|ders, than for the Increa&s;e of his Fame, which &s;tands not in need of any &s;uch Helps to e&s;tabli&s;h it.</P>
<P>He was de&s;cended of the ancient Family of <HI>Bul&s;trode</HI>, in the County of <HI>Bucks</HI>. Their first Name was <HI>Shobbington</HI>, and came to be chang'd into that of <HI>Bul&s;trode</HI> by this re|markable Adventure, which I have learn'd from &s;ome of the Family them&s;elves. The Story, as they report it, runs thus. When <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror had &s;ubdu'd this Kingdom to his Obedience, he granted the E|&s;tate of the <HI>Shobbington</HI>'s, who&s;e capital Seat, now likewi&s;e call'd <HI>Bul&s;trode</HI>'s, was &s;itua|ted in the middle of a fine Park, by <HI>Gerard</HI>'s Cro&s;s near <HI>Beaconsfield</HI>, and had been in their Family for &s;everal Ages before, to a certain
<PB REF="13">
<HI>Norman</HI> Lord who came over with him: of which the <HI>Shobbington</HI>, who then enjoy'd it, having notice, he re&s;olv'd rather to die upon the Spot, than tamely to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be turn'd out of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Inheritance, which had de&s;cended to him from his Ance|&s;tors. In this Re&s;olution he arm'd his Ser|vants and his Tenants, who&s;e Number was very con&s;iderable. Upon which the <HI>Norman</HI> Lord, who had Advice of it, obtain'd of the King a thou&s;and of his Regular Troops, to help him to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the E&s;tate by Force: whereupon <HI>Shobbington</HI> apply'd him|&s;elf to his Relations and Neighbours to a&s;&s;ist him; and the two ancient Families of the <HI>Hambden</HI>'s and <HI>Penn</HI>'s took Arms, together with their Servants and Tenants, and came to his Relief. When they were all joyn'd, they ca&s;t up Works, who&s;e Remains appear to this Day, in the Place where the Park now is; and the <HI>Norman</HI> Lord, with his Forces, came and encamp'd before their Intrench|ments. Now whether it were that they wanted Hor&s;es, or not, is uncertain; but the Story goes, That having manag'd a par|cel of Bulls, they mounted them, and &s;ally|ing out of their Intrenchments in the Night, &s;urpriz'd the <HI>Normans</HI> in their Camp, kill'd many of them, and put the rest to Flight. The King having Intelligence of it, and not thinking it &s;afe for him, while his
<PB REF="14">
Power was yet new and un&s;ettled, to drive a daring and ob&s;tinate People to De&s;pair, &s;ent a Herald to them, to know what they would have, and promis'd <HI>Shobbington</HI> a Safe Con|duct, if he would come to Court; which <HI>Shobbington</HI> accordingly did, riding thither upon a Bull. Being introduc'd into the Royal Pre&s;ence, the King a&s;k'd him his Demands, and why he alone dar'd to re&s;ist, when the rest of the Kingdom had &s;ubmitted to his Go|vernment, and own'd him for their Sove|reign? <HI>Shobbington</HI> an&s;wer'd, That he and his Ance&s;tors had long been Inhabitants of this I&s;land, and had enjoy'd that E&s;tate for many Years; that if the King would permit him to keep it, he would become his Subject, and be faithful to him, as he had been to his Predece&s;&s;ors. The King gave him his Royal Word, that he would, and immediately grant|ed him the free Enjoyment of his E&s;tate: Upon which the Family was from thence call'd <HI>Shobbington, ali&agrave;s Bul&s;trode;</HI> but in Proce&s;s of Time the fir&s;t Name was di&s;con|tinued, and that of <HI>Bul&s;trode</HI> only has re|main'd to them. The Truth of this Story is not only confirm'd by long Tradition in the Family, but by &s;everal Memoirs which they have &s;till remaining, and by the Ruins of the Works, that are to this Day &s;een in the Park of <HI>Bul&s;trodes</HI>, as well as by the Crest of their Arms, which is, <HI>a Bull's Head cabo&s;s'd
<PB REF="15">
Gules, attir'd Or, between two Wings Sa|ble</HI>. The E&s;tate of <HI>Bul&s;trodes</HI> remain'd in, and continu'd to be, the Seat of the Family, till about forty Years ago, when it was first &s;old, and has &s;ince pa&s;s'd through &s;everal Hands. The Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> now enjoys it by Inheritance from his Father, who was the last that purchas'd it. But to return to our Author.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard Bul&s;trode</HI> was born in the Year of our Lord <HI>1610</HI>. He was the el|dest Son of <HI>Edward Bul&s;trode</HI> of the <HI>Inner-Temple</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a very learned Lawyer, as ap|pears by his Book <HI>of Reports</HI>, a Work in great E&s;teem to this Day. The first Years of his Youth were, as u&s;ual, &s;pent at School; whence he was remov'd to <HI>Pembroke</HI> Hall in <HI>Cambridge</HI>, where he continu'd his Stu|dies for &s;everal Years. In <HI>1633</HI>, being then about twenty three Years of Age, he writ a Poem on the Birth of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>, which is &s;till extant in the Collections of the Poems of that Univer&s;ity. From <HI>Cambridge</HI> he went to the Inns of Court, and was en|ter'd in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with his Father. He became a Barri&s;ter at Law, and pra|ctis'd as &s;uch till the breaking out of the Civil Wars, when his Affection to the King's Cau&s;e made him quit the Gown, and drew him to the Army; where he behav'd him&s;elf with &s;o much Prudence, Bravery, and Con|duct,
<PB REF="16">
that King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>1^&s;^t</HI> &s;oon made him Adjutant General of his Army, and af|terwards Quarter-Ma&s;ter General; in which Post he continued to &s;erve till the di&s;banding of the King's Forces at <HI>Truro</HI>.</P>
<P>When that unnatural Rebellion was ended, and King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>2^d</HI> happily re&s;tor'd, our Author after &s;ome Years Atten|dance on the Court, and being now above &s;ixty years of Age, was at length, in Reward of his long and faithful Services to the Crown, &s;ent to re&s;ide at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> in Quality of Agent for that Prince; and from thence he writ the&s;e Letters, with which we here pre&s;ent the Publick.</P>
<P>In the Year <HI>1675.</HI> he return'd to <HI>England</HI> to give the King an Account of his Negotia|tions, with which his Maje&s;ty was &s;o well &s;a|tisfy'd, that he conferr'd on him the Honour of Knighthood, and in a few Months &s;ent him back again to that Court with the Cha|racter of his Re&s;ident there. This is confirm'd by the Credential Letters, which the King writ in his behalf to the Duke <HI>de Villa Her|mo&s;a</HI>, then Governour General of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI>, and which are as follows.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>Richard Bul&s;trode</HI> continu'd Re&s;ident at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> till the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>2^d</HI>, when his Succe&s;&s;or King <HI>James</HI> the <HI>2^d</HI> conferr'd on him a yet higher Honour, and made him his Envoy at the &s;ame Court, where he &s;erv'd the Crown in that Mini&s;try, till his unfortunate Ma&s;ter was forc'd to retire into <HI>France:</HI> whither his faithful Envoy &s;oon follow'd him, and ended his Days at the Court of St. <HI>Germans, Octob. 3.</HI> N. S.
<PB REF="21">
being a hundred and one Years old and two Months.</P>
<P>He was twice marry'd: His first Wife was Daughter of <HI>Edward Dineley</HI> of <HI>Charl|ton</HI>, near <HI>Eve&s;ham</HI>, in the County of <HI>Worce|&s;ter</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>, and Sister to Sir <HI>Edward Dineley</HI> lately deceas'd: By her he had two Sons, who are both living. <HI>Whitlock Bul&s;trode</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the youngest of them, a Barri&s;ter at Law, is now one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Exci&s;e. And this honourable Gentleman gives me leave to a&s;&s;ure the Publick, that he has &s;een the Ori|ginals of the&s;e Letters, and knows them to be his Father Sir <HI>Richard Bul&s;trode</HI>'s own Hand-writing: which ought to be Satisfa|ction enough to the World that they are genu|ine, and render it needle&s;s to give any Ac|count how we came by them.</P>
<P>His &s;econd Wife was Daughter of M. <HI>Stam|ford</HI>, who was Envoy to the Court of <HI>Eng|land</HI> from the Duke of <HI>Newbourg</HI>, now Ele|ctor <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI>. By her he has left behind him three Sons and four Daugh|ters, &s;everal of whom are under twenty years of Age; but his elde&s;t Son now living, whom he had by his former Wife, is Sixty one and upwards.</P>
<P>He enjoy'd a wonderful Firmne&s;s of Mind and Strength of Body to the very last. After he was four&s;core Years old and more, he would often walk twelve Miles in a Morning,
<PB REF="22">
and &s;tudy as many Hours in a Day. And tho' it may &s;eem a Paradox, old tho' he was, it cannot &s;trictly be &s;aid, that he dy'd of old Age: The Di&s;ea&s;e that carry'd him off, was a Stoppage at his Stomach, caus'd by an In|dige&s;tion: Neverthele&s;s had proper Remedies been apply'd, he might, in all probability, have worn out &s;everal Years longer: But his Phy&s;ician, who under&s;tood his Con&s;titution, being out of the way, tho&s;e that were &s;ent for to his Relief, durst not, by rea&s;on of his Age, give him a Vomit; the want of which, 'tis thought, ha&s;ten'd his End.</P>
<P>He was accompl&s;h'd with all manner of Abilities for the greate&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s: He per|fectly under&s;tood the Interests of Princes, and the Arts and Intriegues of Courts, and often tran&s;acted Affairs of the utmo&s;t Importance: In all which he ever behav'd him&s;elf with in|defatigable Integrity, and un&s;u&s;pected Secrecy. And certainly his Conduct mu&s;t have been ve|ry unblameable, which had been try'd in Bu|&s;ine&s;s of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, and pra|ctis'd in the hazardous Secrets of Courts and Cabinets, and yet nothing di&s;graceful was ever alledg'd against it.</P>
<P>He was throughly acquainted with the an|cient and the modern Languages, and had been very conver&s;ant in the Lecture of the best Authors; which he not only retain'd in
<PB REF="23">
his Memory, but had dige&s;ted likewi&s;e in his Judgment. With the&s;e Advantages he left behind him &s;everal Treati&s;es of his own com|po&s;ing; as the Lives of his three Ma&s;ters, King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>1^&s;^t</HI>, King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>2^d</HI>, and King <HI>James</HI> the <HI>2^d</HI>, and E&s;&s;ays on &s;eve|ral Subjects; with all which we hope to oblige the Publick in a &s;hort time; none of them having yet &s;een the Light, except the Life of King <HI>James</HI> the <HI>2^d</HI>, which has been lately printed at <HI>Rome</HI>. His E&s;&s;ays are ve|ry much commended by judicious Per&s;ons to whom he had &s;hewn them in his Life-time: He de&s;ign'd them for the Pre&s;s, and we ex|pect that they will e'er long be tran&s;mitted hither for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When he was above eighty Years of Age he compos'd in Latin Ver&s;e <HI>185</HI>, as well Ele|gies as Epigrams, all of them on divine Sub|jects. Tho&s;e likewi&s;e he intended to be prin|ted, and &s;ome time before his Death, &s;ent them over to his Son, <HI>Whitlock Bul&s;trode</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for that purpo&s;e: But this worthy Gentleman, reflecting with good Rea&s;on, that a Book of Divine Poems would perhaps agree but ill with the Temper of the pre&s;ent Age, which &s;eems to delight more in War, than in Piety, has hitherto kept them to him&s;elf, and re&s;erves them for a more favourable Opportu|nity. However to give the World a Ta&s;te of
<PB REF="24">
them, as well as of his E&s;&s;ays, we have here, till they are publi&s;h'd together in one Volume, &s;ubjoin'd &s;ome of tho&s;e Poems, together with a Letter, which, a few Years ago, he writ to his above-mention'd Son, on the Subject of Retirement: And thus we conclude this &s;hort Account of our Author.</P>

<HEAD>An <HI>EXTRACT</HI> of a <HI>Letter</HI> to his Son concerning <HI>RETIREMENT</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>AS to what you have thought upon, and de&s;ire my Advice in, it is indeed one of the mo&s;t difficult things a Man can do; for this &s;olitary Entertainment of our &s;elves, is either one of the be&s;t, or the wor&s;t things we can undertake. He that will withdraw him&s;elf mu&s;t fir&s;t prepare to receive him&s;elf. It is not Wi&s;dom to o|verdrive Nature, which is to draw a Blemi&s;h upon our Judgment. Men that retire &s;hould fir&s;t examine the Difficulty of the Enterprize; for without this prelimi|nary Prudence a Man may overburthen his Shoulders, and &s;oon wade out of depth; and it is to many better in Pro&s;pect than in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is indeed no &s;uch ea|&s;y matter as many Men believe, to make a &s;afe Retreat from the World, to tru&s;s up our Baggage, and bid our Company farewel; this is a Burthen which few Men can take up hand&s;omely. For a Man to leave off all Bu|&s;ine&s;s, to anticipate the Accidents of Fortune, to deprive him&s;elf of his pre&s;ent Advantages, to place him&s;elf up|on the lowe&s;t Step in this World, thereby to &s;ecure him&s;elf from falling, is an Action of extream Difficulty, as well as of an extraordinary Vertue. Neither is it enough only to &s;eparate our &s;elves from the Conver&s;e of Peo|ple, for tho' we have freed our &s;elves from Bu&s;ine&s;s, from the Court, from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Hall, yet we are not thereby free from the principal Torments of our Life: And as <HI>Socrates</HI> being a&s;k'd by one who had b$en long abroad, why he had not more improv'd him|&s;elf
<PB REF="48">
by Travel, an&s;wered well, becau&s;e he had not left him&s;elf behind him, when he went to travel. So be|fore a Man leaves the World, if he do not first di&s;|charge both him&s;elf and his mind from the burthen that pre&s;&s;es her, retiring will but &s;tar it the more, and pre&s;s it the harder; as a &s;ick Man &s;uffers more hurt than good by changing place: It is but &s;etling an Evil in&s;tead of removing it; and if we ca&s;t but a kind look upon what we have left behind, we &s;till carry our Fetters along with us, and are not at liberty; we ought therefore at first to recover our &s;elves from our &s;elves, for without managing our &s;uperiour part, all the pains taken about the inferiour is to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is certainly a rare thing, that every Man &s;hould &s;ufficiently &s;tand in awe of him&s;elf, <HI>Ut &s;atis &s;e qui&s;|que vereatur</HI>, That we &s;hould win &s;o much upon our &s;elves, as to be able to dwell and delight in our &s;elves. We must not &s;o tie up our &s;elves to the things of this World, that our felicity depend upon them, but re&s;erve a Store-hou&s;e to our &s;elves, (what need &s;oever happen) wherein we may &s;ecure and e&s;tabli&s;h our true content|ment and principal retreat. This World is a Comedy wherein every Man acts that part which Providence hath a&s;&s;ign'd him; and as it is e&s;teem'd more noble to lo$k on than to act, &s;o there is no &s;ecurer B$x from which to behold it, than a &s;afe retreat, it being ea&s;ier to feel than expre&s;s the plea&s;ure you will take with that your own Family, in &s;tanding aloof off, and in con|templating the reelings and bu&s;slings of the multitude upon this Stage of the World.</P>
<P>There is no Coun&s;el more proper for Men, than <HI>Te|cum habita</HI>, to dwell at home, and not &s;uffer any thing to &s;teal us from our &s;elves; there is neither profit nor plea&s;ure worth &s;o much, that we &s;hould go abroad to &s;ick it. Even many of the <HI>Epicurean</HI> Sect, (who propos'd to them&s;elves no other end but their content|ment)
<PB REF="49" MS="Y">
did bereave them&s;elves of all &s;en&s;ual delights, and contemn'd the pomp of all worldly Greatne&s;s for the only plea&s;ure of Contemplation.</P>
<P>But you that are a wi&s;e Chri&s;tian, and have well provided for your &s;elf and Family, and that may within your own heart enjoy both Vertue and God him&s;elf, have much higher advantages, and much more rea&s;on to keep within your own home, looking upon things without with an indifferent eye. That Man forgets his origin, who puts his &s;oul $ out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her &s;elf, by continually running after bu&s;ine&s;s, and plodding to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> full of embarra&s;s; whereas he &s;hould abandon, and bid adieu to all manner of bu&s;ine&s;s, that may any way im|peach the tranquillity of mind or body. He that thus re|tires, draws no man's envy upon him; he reigns by him&s;elf over his family, and all the pomp which great|ne&s;s draws after it, is not comparable to that which you will enjoy in &s;ecret by thus retiring; which is in|deed to &s;hut up the pro&s;pect of this world, that we may take the better view of the other, by a prudent precaution, to untwi&s;t our affections, and &s;lide off from the World, before the World &s;lips from us; whereas they that continue in the throng of bu&s;ine&s;s, their minds lo&s;e their re&s;t; and many times after a man hath lo&s;t his re&s;t he lo&s;eth his labour al&s;o.</P>
<P>We have never greater cau&s;e to con&s;ult our be&s;t wits, what we are to do, and how to carry our &s;elves, than when preferment, or publick employments are offered us. He that hath &s;trength and wi&s;dom to manage &s;uch places, may receive them; but he that hath enough for him&s;elf and family, ought not to entangle him&s;elf again with more than he can well manage, and make his whole life a burthen to him. And tho&s;e wi&s;ely retire who being hara&s;&s;ed with the fatigues of a publick life, fore&s;eeing ill weather, are willing to put into port, when keeping out at Sea might endanger the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><PB REF="50">When God intended to conver&s;e with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, he call'd him from the populous City to the top of Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>, and Chri&s;t did not di&s;clo&s;e the Glories of his transfigu|ration at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>, but upon the Mount of Olives; and when God did di&s;ciple his beloved but rebellious People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>, he cho&s;e fir&s;t the Wilderne&s;s, and then the two Captivities to be his School.</P>
<P>You &s;hould con&s;ider the notable An&s;wer given by <HI>Cy|neas</HI> the Phil&s;opher to <HI>Pyrrhus</HI>, who told him, <HI>he would conquer</HI> Greece, <HI>then</HI> Rome, <HI>and &s;o all the World. Cyneas</HI> ask'd him, <HI>Why he would give him|&s;elf &s;o much trouble?</HI> To which <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> told him, <HI>He would do it, that he might afterwards live hap|pily and merrily with his Friends</HI>. But <HI>Cyneas</HI> &s;harply reply'd, <HI>He might do &s;o pre&s;ently, and not take &s;o much pains for it:</HI> And &s;o you may do now with your Family. Indeed Men that are &s;till bu&s;ied in publick Affairs, who&s;e mercurial Genius inclines them to a re&s;tle&s;s Life, they (like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> on <HI>Pi&s;gah)</HI> &s;ee Re|tirement their Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> afar off, but without hopes of enjoyment. And I have known &s;ome good Men in the la&s;t Age, who would never leave Employments till outed of them; like Whales that never come on &s;hoar till they are wounded. And certainly tho&s;e who after po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing great Places have been unexpectedly di&s;|grac'd, are more really convinc'd of its &s;lipperyne&s;s than tho&s;e that never found the Effects of &s;uch Revolution. Nay tho&s;e very Men who &s;eek greedily after Employ|ments pretend thereby a de&s;ign for Retirement. The Merchants who &s;eek abroad &s;o much for Riches, is on|ly to gain &s;o much as may afford the conveniency of a Retirement; and Soldiers do &s;weeten the bitterne&s;s of their life by the remote pro&s;pect of a good Garri&s;on and Winter-quarter. And <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> him&s;elf &s;aid, <HI>Ali|quando mihi licebit mini vivere</HI>, he de&s;ired his &s;pare
<PB REF="51">
Hours, e&s;teeming that part of his life to belong to others which he &s;pent for other Men.</P>
<P>I know and have &s;een &s;ome Men retire from the World, who have yet look'd back at it, and oftentimes have kept their hearts in it. Thus many of the Phi|lo&s;ophers left the World in effect, but not in affection; for they had only their arms and legs out of the throng, their minds were &s;till engaged. The&s;e Men did not take the right way; they thought they had wholly ta|ken leave of all bu&s;ine&s;s, that they might live at more lei&s;ure and greater ea&s;e, but they mi&s;took them|&s;elves; for tho' they had &s;haken off the Court, and pub|lick Employments, they had not taken leave of the principal vexations of life, nor di&s;charged their minds of the burthens which oppre&s;&s;ed them: They had not order'd their contentment to depend wholly upon them|&s;elves, and that they could live alone in good earnest, and at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>However Men may conver&s;e with the World, and yet leave it; we may pa&s;s thro' a crowd, and not mingle with it. Every Ship that &s;ails mu&s;t needs have &s;ome part of the Ship under water; every Man that lives in this World, must needs have &s;ome of his labours &s;pent upon the World; but as that part of the Ship by which a Man &s;ails is above the water, &s;o that part of us, which is above the earth, we must re|move it from the World. Thus &s;ome Men (in which number I hope you are) have attain'd to that &s;ublimity of mind as to be above all worldly cares; and tho' they meddle with the World as being in the World, yet they do it &s;o &s;afely, that they cleave not to it, nor are a&s;toni&s;h'd to leave it.</P>
<P>It is a great mi&s;ery for a Man never to be his own; too much bu&s;ine&s;s makes us &s;trangers to our &s;elves; the content we expect by our conver&s;ation is lost by too much conver&s;ation; and the advantages we get by our
<PB REF="52">
Employments abroad, are not to be compared with the &s;atisfaction we receive in Retirement, (which I have found by long experience in the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s of greatest con&s;equence, during the many Years I was in publick Employment:) For as Bees must retire to the honey after they have gather'd the matter from flowers, &s;o is it nece&s;&s;ary that we retire into our &s;elves to ga|ther the fruit of our experience; otherwi&s;e we &s;hall be but ill Husbands of the wealth we have gotten.</P>
<P>To retire for quiet and thinking is very recommen|dable; Bu&s;ine&s;s and Conver&s;ation are thieves that &s;teal away a great part of our time, and u&s;ually &s;tuffs our memory with rubbi&s;h; Retirement is a great relief in &s;uch a ca&s;e, and wi&s;e Men are glad to get clear of the crowd, for fre&s;h air and breathing; and a life led in &s;weet tranquillity (which is the work of rea&s;on) is much preferable to the great advantages which the World admires. In Retirement we ta&s;te the &s;weetne&s;s of a quiet repo&s;e, and entertain our &s;elves with free|dom; nay, we live more in two days of retreat, than in two years full of bu&s;ine&s;s and trouble. And in this you may trust me, who have gone thro' more bu&s;ine&s;s military and civil, than perhaps any Man now li|ving; and yet I have &s;een greater things in my re|tired life, than ever I &s;aw abroad. For what do we &s;ee great in the World. but Armies, Sieges of Towns, Courts of Princes, which &s;eem great at first &s;ight? But in Retirement, we look upon the different works of Nature, the Sun ri&s;ing and &s;etting, a &s;till Night, and tho&s;e Planets which &s;o maje&s;tically rowl over our heads, which we continually admire. I could &s;ay much more to you upon this Subject, having found great advantages &s;ince my removal from the throng of bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;hall conclude with what <HI>Similis</HI> a great General to the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI> did, who after his Honours, Victories, and Preferments, retired into the
<PB REF="53">
Country to his own hou&s;e for &s;even years before he died, and de&s;ired the &s;ub&s;tance of this Epitaph to be engraved only upon his Tomb &s;tone. <HI>Here lyes Ge|neral</HI> Similis <HI>of a very great Age, who yet lived but &s;even years</HI>, relating only to the time of his Re|tirement.</P>
<P>I hope you will excu&s;e this long Letter; but I can never leave talking with you till I come to the bot|tom, e&s;pecially upon &s;o good a Subject, and upon your own de&s;ire; and I doubt not but you will chu&s;e what &s;hall be most conducing to your own contentment. I have nothing el&s;e to add, but to a&s;&s;ure you that I de|&s;ire nothing more in this World but once to have the &s;atisfaction of embracing you, and giving you my last Ble&s;&s;ing, with &s;everal Collections and Writings of my own, which may be &s;atisfactory to you, and pre&s;erve my memory. Be&s;ides I have &s;uch a Collection of Let|ters of the most eminent Per&s;ons of this last Age as are not any where el&s;e, and all dige&s;ted into order, which I would most willingly put into your hands be|fore I die. To which end I would very willingly meet you at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, or any other place within the Allies Dominions, believing my Lord <HI>Marleborough</HI> would ea&s;ily grant me a Pa&s;s, from whom I have re|ceived great Civilities during this War, which I do not find is now like to end &s;o &s;$on as I thought: Adieu, and believe me over most intirely Yours.</P>

<P>UPON the Arrival of <HI>Don Bernardo Sali|nas</HI>, the Ma&s;ter de Camp General was &s;ent for from <HI>Flanders</HI>, who return'd hither on Sunday Morning. In his Pa&s;|&s;age between <HI>Bruges</HI> and <HI>Gaunt</HI>, having with him a good Convoy of Hor&s;e, they took a &s;mall Party of <HI>French</HI> Foot, who had before ta|ken &s;ome Pri&s;oners upon the River, and were convoying them to their Garri&s;on of <HI>Pouke</HI>, a League and an half from the River; the <HI>French</HI> Par|ty were all taken, and brought hither Pri&s;oners on Sunday Night. The &s;ame Evening his Excellency was long in Council with his General Officers, where <HI>Don Bernardo Salinas</HI> was admitted; and there it was re&s;olved, That the Ma&s;ter de Camp General &s;hould go with <HI>Don Bernardo</HI> to the <HI>Hague</HI>, to adju&s;t all Matters with his Highne&s;s in
<PB N="2" REF="55">
relation to the Campaign, and they depart hence either on Thur&s;day or Friday at farthe&s;t. In the mean time the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> continues at <HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI>, for the receiving and di&s;|po&s;ing of &s;ome Regiments that are marching thi|ther from <HI>Holland</HI>. It &s;eems the exce&s;&s;ive Snow has made &s;o great an Inundation between <HI>Gaunt</HI> and <HI>Bruges</HI>, that the Dike of the Pa&s;&s;age River is broken on both Sides, and all that Country is like a Sea, there being no Pa&s;&s;age either for Boats or Waggons; the Boats are forced to go to the <HI>Sa&s;$</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI>, and &s;o by the way of <HI>Sluce</HI>. The High Way where the Dike is broken, on the North &s;ide the River, lies fourteen Foot deep in Water, but many Hands are at Work to repair it.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> continues our Governor here, where he was Ye&s;terday very bu&s;y in draw|ing together our Forces both of Hor&s;e and Foot, who were all in Arms in the Market-Place, and the Sabloon, the Ports of the Town, being all kept &s;hut for the more &s;olemn Execution of <HI>Vant|lo</HI> the Burgher: He was hanged in the Market Place, and afterwards his Body carry'd out and hung upon a Gibbet by the Fort, which he had de&s;igned to betray. After the Execution his Ex|cellency declared publickly, That the Plot was &s;o well laid, that had it not been prevented by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain's Di&s;covery, it would infalli|bly have &s;ucceeded, and the Fort, and con&s;equent+ly the Town, would have been taken. Befor$ his Execution, he confe&s;&s;ed the Sentence again&s;$ him was ju&s;t, that he had received for fiv$ Months pa&s;t 100 Crowns a Month, Pen&s;ion from <HI>France</HI>, and 100 Pi&s;toles upon his fir&s;t Agreement Some others, that are in Pri&s;on upon the &s;am$ Account, have not yet been put to the Que&s;tion
<PB N="3" REF="56">
As for his Wife and Si&s;ter, he declar'd them in|nocent of the Plot, and that they knew not what was in the Letters they burnt, which was by his Command.</P>
<P>On Saturday Morning I waited upon <HI>D.B. Salinas</HI>, who told me, among&s;t other Di&s;cour&s;es, that our Amba&s;&s;adors at <HI>Cologn</HI> would not return for <HI>En|gland</HI> &s;o &s;oon as was believ'd, there being great Appearance that one of them would go to <HI>Vienna</HI> and the other to the <HI>Hague</HI>, in order to His Ma|je&s;ty's Mediation for a General Peace; but with|out <HI>France</HI> quitted all that was taken &s;ince the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Treaty with <HI>Lorrain</HI>, and the Imperial Towns in <HI>Al&s;ace</HI>, there would be no Peace; and &s;aid farther, though His Maje&s;ty had declar'd a Neutrality, yet 'twas vi&s;ible by their Proceedings, that the Court of <HI>England</HI> was at this time as much <HI>French</HI> as before. I thought not fit to con|te&s;t with him, and &s;o only gave him a calm hearing.</P>
<P>La&s;t Night being in Conver&s;ation with a prin|cipal Per&s;on of this Court, who is privy to their mo&s;t intimate Councils, a Di&s;cour&s;e being rai&s;ed concerning our pre&s;ent War, and His Maje&s;ty's making the late Peace, and quitting <HI>France</HI>; that Gentleman thereupon took an Occa&s;ion to &s;ay, That it was the Opinion of the wi&s;e&s;t Men about his Excellency, that His Maje&s;ty had made this Peace with the full Con&s;ent of the King of <HI>France</HI>, which would in the end prove more to that King's Advantage than their Conjunction, and that it was a great Mi&s;take in tho&s;e, that thought this Peace was made by Con&s;traint of the Parlia|ment, which he had made rather by his own Ele|ction; and that the Rea&s;ons inducing them here to be of this Opinion, were, That His Maje&s;ty
<PB N="4" REF="57">
finding &s;o &s;trong an Union again&s;t <HI>France</HI>, that it was like to be a general War in the&s;e parts of <HI>Europe</HI>, and that there was no di&s;intere&s;&s;ed Prince &s;ufficiently pui&s;&s;ant to become Mediator; His Maje&s;ty therefore by quitting <HI>France</HI>, and decla|ring a Neutrality, was the only Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> able to balance, and con&s;equently to be a Media|tor, which he had re&s;olv'd upon, and was at this time propo&s;ing; and that if the <HI>French</HI> King could but maintain the War this Summer, His Maje&s;ty of <HI>England</HI> would get &s;o great Advantages by car|rying away all the Trade, and would be &s;o en|rich'd by that and the Retrenchment of his Army, that he would the next Year be able, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Parliament, to carry on a War again&s;t tho&s;e that &s;hould refu&s;e a rea&s;onable Peace. And that this was &s;o much their Belief here and in <HI>Hol|and</HI>, (confirm'd now to them by <HI>D. B. S.)</HI> that in ca&s;e they could take His Maje&s;ty at an Advantage, upon a &s;ufficient and vi&s;ible Breach of this Peace by his &s;uccouring of <HI>France</HI>, that they would then prevent his Mediation by declaring again&s;t him. He &s;aid farther, That they feared either the Mar|que&s;s <HI>de Fre&s;no</HI> had not taken that due Caution as he &s;hould, in relation to that Article of not giving Succours to the <HI>French</HI>, or el&s;e that he does not take &s;ufficient notice of &s;ome Actions &s;ince the Peace, which have rai&s;ed great Jealou&s;ies both in <HI>Holland</HI> and here, as to the Sincerity of His Ma|je&s;ty's Proceedings herein; and &s;aid, That it was apparent the&s;e were His Maje&s;ty's Intentions in clapping up the Peace, &s;ince he continued his Amba&s;&s;adors &s;till at <HI>Cologn</HI>, tho' the Work was done to their Hands, who&s;e &s;tay there is only in Order to His Maje&s;ty's Mediation, that from be|ing Parties they may turn Mediators. In fine, he
<PB N="5" REF="58">
concluded, That the weight of all depended upon the Succe&s;s of this Campaign, and that if the <HI>French</HI> could bear out this Summer again&s;t &s;o powerful Oppo&s;ition without any great Shock, we mu&s;t then be nece&s;&s;itated here to come to a Treaty in the Winter; and believ'd the Re&s;ult of all would be, <HI>France</HI> to quit all their Conque&s;ts in <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>, except <HI>Li&s;le</HI> and <HI>Doway</HI>, which he was confident they would never part with; <HI>Ma|&s;tricht</HI> to be given to us, and <HI>Ayre</HI> and <HI>St. Omers</HI> to the <HI>French</HI>, with the Re&s;titution of <HI>Lorrain</HI>, and an Accommodement of the Differences in <HI>Al|&s;ace</HI>, and that a Peace upon Terms &s;omething near this would be the end of this War, notwith|&s;tanding all our great Demands.</P>
<P>This being a Di&s;cour&s;e from a Per&s;on very con|&s;iderable in their Councils, by which &s;omething of their pre&s;ent Temper may be judged, I thought fit to repre&s;ent it to your Lord&s;hip, humbly be|&s;eeching your Honour to take my free Relation of the&s;e Particulars in good part; &s;ince I am of no Faction, nor have any End or Intere&s;t, but faithfully to perform that Duty I owe to his Sa|cred Maje&s;ty, and that Service which I &s;hall al|ways pay to your Lord&s;hip with great Zeal and Ob&s;ervance, being in all Humility,</P>

<SALUTE><HI>Worthy Sir,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am afraid I tire both your &s;elf and his Lord|&s;hip with the long Account I u&s;ually give; if &s;o, I beg you will give me a little Caution, and I will be &s;ure to govern my &s;elf according|ly. Our la&s;t Letters from <HI>England</HI>, which were of the 30^t^h pa&s;t, and brought Orders for their Excellencies Returns, came too late to go by the Po&s;t, and &s;o went not till Ye&s;terday, and will not be with them 'till to morrow Morning; but his Excellency writes me Word by his of the 10^t^h in&s;tant, that they are preparing for their Return though they had not then receiv'd their Orders, finding the Emperor's Amba&s;&s;ador begin to deme&s;|nage; and &s;ays he will &s;end me the preci&s;e Time and Day of their Departure, de&s;iring that I would give them a meeting in <HI>Holland</HI>, in their Pa&s;&s;age, it being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in relation to &s;ome Affairs they have there, and that it will not take me up above five or &s;ix Days at mo&s;t; in which time I will take Care the Wheel &s;hall go in my Ab&s;ence; and I be&s;eech you to a&s;&s;ure his Lord|&s;hip, that I will return with all imaginable Dili|gence to my Station $$re. It will be the latter end of the next Week, I pre&s;ume, before I can have an A&s;&s;urance from his Excellency upon what Day they will depart: $o that I &s;hall &s;carce go from hence till Monday &s;ennight, and &s;hall be &s;ure to give you a preci&s;e Account when I go, and when I &s;hall return. I am in great want of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Theu$e$</HI>, who has been ab&s;ent above a Fortnight: I had much Light from him, he being daily with his Excellency. When I was at <HI>Antwerp</HI> I made
<PB N="7" REF="60">
inquiry after him where he lodged; but from thence he went to an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Pa&s;tor in <HI>Flanders</HI>, and I have never &s;ince heard of him, nor know not where to &s;end to him, to ha&s;ten him back; for if he were here in my Ab&s;ence, I could well di|rect how you &s;hould have a good Account. I intend writing to him to morrow by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Je|&s;uit here, who tells me he will direct my Letters to him; and I hope he will be back before my going for <HI>Holland</HI>, and I will &s;o contrive it, that I will not be ab&s;ent above two Po&s;ts.</P>
<P>My whole Dependence is upon you, as to what Allowance his Lord&s;hip will plea&s;e to give me, and I &s;hould be glad to be at a Certainty, that I might the better know how to govern my &s;elf. I can a&s;&s;ure you my Charges are very great, all things growing dearer than ordinary, by rea&s;on of the Placaert for all Hou&s;e-keepers to &s;tore them|&s;elves with Provi&s;ions for two Months. I am nece&s;&s;itated to keep two Hor&s;es, the Charges of which are great, and my Journies to and again upon Occa&s;ions, with po&s;tage of Letters, not on|ly from <HI>England</HI> but from other Places where I have a con&s;tant Corre&s;pondence, co&s;ts me much; be&s;ides, the Pains I take is more than ordinary, having only Sunday in the whole Week free to my &s;elf; but I confe&s;s when their Excellencies are re|mov'd from <HI>Cologn</HI> it will not be &s;o much. I humbly &s;ubmit all to your Management, de&s;iring you will plea&s;e to manage it &s;o tenderly, that his Lord&s;hip may not think I would not refer it wholly to his Genero&s;ity; but however, I beg you will get &s;uch Directions from him, that Mr. <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI> may have a general Order from you to furni&s;h me with &s;uch a Proportion Monthly as may &s;upply my pre&s;ent Occa&s;ions, that I may
<PB N="8" REF="61">
not run in debt, and lo&s;e my Credit, for then I &s;hall be able do his Lord&s;hip no Service. Mr. <HI>Ni|pho</HI> had an Allowance of 20 <HI>s.</HI> a Day, and yet kept no Hor&s;e, and had all extraordinary Char|ges paid, of &s;ending Letters and Expre&s;&s;es; and I am &s;ure I &s;hall do as much Service as ever he did. I give you this Account more particularly, that you may the better know how to di&s;cour&s;e it with his Lord&s;hip; but in the interim, I beg you will plea&s;e to &s;end a Letter to Mr. <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI>, that he may give me &s;ome Credit upon Occa&s;ion, for there may &s;ome Accident happen that may require my &s;udden co|ming my &s;elf to give an Account of it. But I mu&s;t beg your Pardon that I give you &s;o great a Trouble in my Concerns, which your own Gene|ro&s;ity and Kindne&s;s to me has brought upon you.</P>
<P>The Baron, I perceive by his Letter this Day, &s;tays his Journey to accompany the Amba&s;&s;adors. I mu&s;t humbly beg you will give my hearty Service to Mr. <HI>Knatchbull</HI>, with my Excu&s;e for not an&s;wer|ing his kind Letter, and be pleas'd to accept of my humble Acknowledgment for the Favour you did in &s;atisfying him for his Nagg. Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> writes me Word, that if the Prince <HI>Barban&s;on</HI> went over before the Convoy, he would &s;end my Ladies things in the Yatch, which I hope are come to her Ladi&s;hip by this; and I believe I &s;hall have a Pair of very fine Servers to &s;end over with the Amba&s;&s;ador's things from <HI>Antwerp</HI>, if not, to carry with me into <HI>Hol|land</HI>, and &s;o &s;end them over by them.</P>

<P>ON Friday Morning before his Excellency's De|parture for <HI>Antwerp</HI>, he gave a Vi&s;it to the Conde&s;table&s;s of <HI>Colonna</HI> in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloi&s;ter, and there promis'd her if &s;he would return to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Antwerp</HI>, &s;he &s;hould not only have the liberty of it, but al&s;o &s;ometimes to take a Turn in the City at the <HI>Tour la Mode</HI>, provided &s;he &s;hould not alight from her Coach, but that &s;ome|times in the Fields &s;he &s;hould have liberty to walk; to which &s;he willingly con&s;ented, and on Saturday Morning was convoy'd to <HI>Antwerp</HI>. 'Tis &s;aid his Excellency has receiv'd Orders from <HI>Rome</HI> for giving her this Liberty, upon Complaints &s;ent thither of her &s;trict Confinement, and like|wi&s;e of the great Di&s;turbance and Offence the Guard of Soldiers gave to the Religious. 'Tis thought &s;he may towards the end of Summer re|turn again for <HI>Italy</HI>.</P>
<P>We hear his Excellency finds but little ground for the Impri&s;onment of tho&s;e Per&s;ons at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, that the Scout has been &s;ome Days &s;ince relea&s;ed, and the re&s;t are like to be &s;uddenly di&s;charged; but I pre&s;ume your Lord&s;hip will receive a more particular Account of that Affair from Mr. <HI>Nipho</HI> who is upon the Place. His Excellency returns not hither till towards the end of the Week, ha|ving &s;ent Ye&s;terday for his Secretaries thither to make the Di&s;patches for <HI>Spain</HI>.</P>
<P>We hear there has been &s;ome tampering by the <HI>French</HI> at our Garri&s;on at <HI>Lieuue</HI> to have had a Half-Moon deliver'd up, but it was di&s;cover'd and
<PB N="10" REF="63">
prevented. The Deputy-Governour is &s;ecured, and &s;ent away to <HI>Tilmont</HI>, to which Place he is con|fin'd at pre&s;ent; but whether he were guilty of Treachery is not &s;aid. On Saturday eleven <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Companies of the Regiment of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> were drawn out of <HI>Lieune</HI>, and &s;ent to <HI>Namur</HI> for the far|ther &s;trengthning that Place, upon intimation that the <HI>French</HI> de&s;ign either upon that Place or <HI>Mons</HI> in the&s;e Parts, or <HI>Ypres</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI>.</P>
<P>La&s;t Night the Marquis <HI>d' A&s;&s;enlart</HI> came hither by his Excellency's Command, having given him an Account of his Negotiation at the <HI>Hague</HI>. He a&s;&s;ures us the <HI>Holland</HI> Troops are now marching, and that in fifteen Days Count <HI>Waldeck</HI> will be here with Seventeen thou&s;and Foot and Eight thou&s;and Hor&s;e. Great Preparations are making for the Lodgment of Ten thou&s;and Men about this City, which we intend to have all this Campaign here, and Baracks are preparing round the Town accordingly, and the Fortifications are ha&s;tning with all imaginable Diligence. His Excellency's Re&s;olutions are to have all his Garri&s;ons well pro|vided with Men and Ammunition, and with a Flying Army to attend the <HI>French</HI> Motions; and if they &s;hall be&s;iege any Place, he will be able to draw an Army of near Fifty thou&s;and Men into the Field to rai&s;e their Siege. In the Interim we are re&s;olv'd that the <HI>French</HI> Bravadoes &s;hall not anger us into a Battel$ nor their Violence force us to fight, but upon great Advantage, being re&s;ol|ved to take all, but to give no Advantage. I wi&s;h the Succe&s;s of this Campaign may an&s;wer our Ex|pectation; but u&s;ually when Men lay too great weight upon &s;uch Props, they are apt to break: The truth is, we are much encourag'd by all the Encounters we have lately had with the <HI>French</HI>,
<PB N="11" REF="64">
wherein we have &s;till &s;ucceeded, and that is a good Omen to begin a Campaign with, all their De|&s;igns having hitherto been broken.</P>
<P>This Afternoon an Expre&s;s is come from the Duke <HI>de Bournovile</HI>, which tells us, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bove&s;&s;ey</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Major-General, and an old <HI>Lor|rain</HI> Officer with Six hundred Hor&s;e, mo&s;t of them Reform'd Officers and Gentlemen, plac'd him&s;elf in Ambu&s;cado to have fallen upon a Quarter of the Duke's; but he having timely notice where and when they intended their Ambu&s;cado, drew out Parties &s;everal ways, and &s;o fell upon them, kill'd Two hundred upon the Place, and eighty Pri&s;oners taken, mo&s;t Officers and Gentlemen, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bove&s;&s;ey</HI> him&s;elf &s;hot through the Body.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding our vigorous Preparations here, and that all the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army is now in the&s;e Parts to the number of Thirty thou&s;and, yet the <HI>French</HI> have adventur'd to be&s;iege the Fort of <HI>Navagne</HI>, which &s;tands upon the River betwixt <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;el</HI>, a &s;mall Fort of four Ba&s;tions, but of great con&s;equence, it being the only Fort and Pa&s;s we have upon that River for keeping our Corre&s;pondency with <HI>Limbourgh</HI>. The <HI>French</HI> have rais'd three Batteries again&s;t it of twelve Pieces each; and I heard the <HI>Rhinegrave</HI> this Day &s;ay, that unle&s;s it were relieved in fix Days it would be yielded.</P>
<P>His Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is gone from his Quarters at <HI>Duffle</HI>, near <HI>Malines</HI>, this Morning, to confer with his Excellency at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>, that their Armies may be put in &s;ome better Po&s;ture than they are at pre&s;ent, the Country &s;uffering extreme|ly by them, and no Order nor Di&s;cipline among&s;t them, which makes the mo&s;t &s;ober People much doubt the Succe&s;s of our Campaign: And 'tis more than whi&s;per'd that there are great Di&s;con|tents and Divi&s;ions among&s;t our great Officers at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>, which has taken wind among&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers, who &s;peak of it with much regret.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>French</HI> laid Siege to <HI>Navagne</HI> they took the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Argenteau</HI>, betwixt <HI>Vi&s;el</HI> and <HI>Leige</HI>, a &s;mall Ca&s;tle, but thought impregnable, being upon a high Rock and a deep Graff round, and the coming to it almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible; there were taken in it a Company of Foot, and the <HI>French</HI> are now undermining of it with intentions to blow it up. It's believ'd that when <HI>Navagne</HI> is taken they will be&s;iege <HI>Limburgh:</HI> This unexpected
<PB N="14" REF="67">
Action of the <HI>French</HI> does much &s;urprize us; for we thought they dur&s;t not have attempted any thing, but only &s;tood upon their Defence: But we are like to find the contrary, for the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> is &s;aid to be at <HI>Binch</HI> attending our Motion, that if we &s;tir that way he is ready to follow us with a con&s;iderable Army; and the truth is we are not as yet in a condition to march, our Army not being yet modelled as it &s;hould be, and the <HI>Holland</HI> Army are &s;o unruly and ill govern'd that we know not what to do with them, mo&s;t of the Officers coming into this Place and other Towns neglecting the Care of their Companies and Troops. His Highne&s;s returns again this Night to his Quarters, and 'tis thought the Army will draw to a general rendezvous on Thur&s;day, in order to attempt &s;omething upon the Enemy.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Ca&s;tlehaven</HI> is &s;ent to <HI>Ruremond</HI> to command there, and to take care that con&s;iderable Place be put into a good Po&s;ture, there being in it near Two thou&s;and Men Hor&s;e and Foot.</P>

<P>SINCE the taking <HI>Navagne</HI>, we have this Ac|count from <HI>Leige</HI>, That there was but one Man killed within the Fort, and but thirty <HI>French</HI> without; that Preparations are making for blow|ing it up, which is not yet done; that the Prince is march'd back towards <HI>Charleroy</HI>; that on <HI>Friday</HI> his Army encamped between <HI>Tongres</HI> and <HI>Leige</HI>, and on <HI>Saturday</HI> the Van Guard of his Army came to <HI>Perwy</HI>, not far from <HI>Gemblours</HI>, taking the way of the Grand <HI>Chau&s;&s;ey</HI>.

proceed to <HI>Armentiers</HI> and <HI>Li&s;le</HI>. But the&s;e are only Conjectures.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> Night we had News from the Duke <HI>de Bournouile</HI>, that &s;ome of the Imperial Recruits were come to him, that the <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> Troops were upon their March with all Diligence, that the 24^t^h in|&s;tant General <HI>Souches</HI> was expected at <HI>Bonn</HI>, and that by the 26^t^h it was hoped he would be with the Army near <HI>Limbourg</HI>, that upon his Arrival the Duke <HI>de Bournouile</HI> goes back to command the imperial Army in the <HI>Palatinate</HI>; in the interim, his Excellency has &s;ent Orders to the Duke <HI>de Bournouile</HI> to advance this way with his Troops, and that the Recruits &s;hould follow; and ac|ordingly we hear that the Van of his Army ar|rived the la&s;t Night not far from <HI>Namur</HI>.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning Mon&s;ieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> was &s;ent by his Excellency to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to &s;ee in what forwardne&s;s the Prince's Army was, and with him went the Quarter-ma&s;ter General to give them an Enlargement of Quarters. At their Return 'twas told his Excellency, That there was more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> than <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;poken at his Highne&s;s's Table, and that they fear the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court has too great an Influence upon his Highne&s;s's Coun|cils, and a &s;mall Matter is enough to rai&s;e a great Jealou&s;y among&s;t us here. All Per&s;ons admire our flow Progre&s;s, and our Military Men begin to &s;peak loud again&s;t it, being generally much di&s;contented; neither does the Prince e&s;cape their Cen&s;ure, believing him not to be &s;o throughly &s;tanch in our Concerns as we expected. We com|plain that his Army is not yet ready, and he re|torts the &s;ame upon us, and that not without Cau&s;e, &s;ince in Truth we are neither of us ready; all our Forces not being yet come together, nei|ther

are the <HI>Friezeland</HI> Troops come up to the Prince; be&s;ides, his Train of Artillery, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty &s;ix Pieces, were but di&s;embarked on <HI>Sun|day</HI> at <HI>Malines</HI>, and are not yet mounted, neither has he as yet Hor&s;es &s;ufficient for his Train of Ar|tillery and Carriages. Ye&s;terday his Highne&s;s changed his Quarters, and advanced nearer <HI>Lou|vain</HI>, having fourteen or fifteen fre&s;h Villages ap|pointed for his Army, tho&s;e he hath hitherto had be|ing quite eaten up. His Army commits &s;o great Di&s;orders, that the Boors are feign to quit their Habitations, and come hither to complain; and notwith&s;tanding his Highne&s;s has publi&s;h'd &s;trict Orders for the better Regulation of his Army, yet it is altogether ineffectual, the Soldiers &s;aying in their Defence, <HI>they do not &s;o much Harm here, as our Auxiliaries did to them in</HI> Holland; which cau|&s;es many to &s;ay, <HI>They come rather to revenge than help</HI>. I wi&s;h we may find good Succe&s;s by their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but I much fear the Continuance of our good Corre&s;pondence, and that we &s;hall eve|ry Day &s;ee greater Differences than other.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI>, with four thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Dragoons, has been for three or four Days in the Campaign, betwixt this and <HI>Vilvord</HI>, along the <HI>Rivage</HI>; the re&s;t of our Army are up|on their March from &s;everal Places; and part of our Train of Artillery, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve Field-pieces, and near an hundred Waggons, are drawn up in the Park under the Court, ready to be &s;pann'd at an Hours warning; and we &s;ay that our own particular Army, which &s;hall march into the Cam|paign, will be about eighteen thou&s;and Men, of which &s;even thou&s;and are Hor&s;e, one thou&s;and five hundred Dragoons, and betwixt nine and ten thou|&s;and Foot; and we are told the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s
<PB N="19" REF="72">
Army will be thirty five thou&s;and effective Men, and the Imperial Army near as many. But with all the&s;e Armies there is nothing yet done but ruining the Country; and we now too late &s;ee the fatal over&s;ight we committed in &s;uffering the Conjunction of the Prince and <HI>Bellefond</HI>, which will put us to the playing an After-Game, where|in we are like to run great Hazard; whereas we might ea&s;ily have ruined both tho&s;e Armies apart, with whom we &s;hall now find enough to do. Ye&s;ternight we had News from the Prince of <HI>Con|de</HI>'s Camp, which was then not far from <HI>Perwy</HI>, towards <HI>Charleroy</HI>, that they gave &s;everal Vollies of Shot throughout their Army, and three Peal of Ordnance; the Cau&s;e of which we knew not, 'till early this Morning that we have received the &s;urprizing News of the Lo&s;s of the Citadel of <HI>Be&s;an&ccedil;on</HI>, and con&s;equently of that whole Pro|vince; that the King of <HI>France</HI> is marching this way with his Hou&s;hold, and Court, and Body of his Army, having nothing more to do in <HI>Burgun|dy</HI> but the reducing &s;ome Forts and Ca&s;tles, which a &s;mall Force will ea&s;ily do. This Account his Excellency received in the Night, and in the Mor|ning about five went in Per&s;on to vi&s;it the Prince&s;s of <HI>Vaudemont</HI>, who had al&s;o &s;everal Letters. 'Tis &s;aid the Prince <HI>de Vaudemont</HI> was u&s;ed with great Civility by the King, who &s;ent an E&s;cort to con|vey him and his Followers to his Father's Army. This News has made &s;o great an Alteration in our Councils, that we &s;carce know what Mea&s;ures to take, and now find to our Co&s;t the ill Con&s;equen|ces of not granting a Neutrality to <HI>Burgundy</HI>.</P>
<P>Before the&s;e Letters came we were puffed up with the Thoughts of what great things we would do upon our Conjunction with the <HI>German</HI> Troops,
<PB N="20" REF="73">
and now we are all &s;o out of Countenance that we know not how to look upon each other; nei|ther has his Excellency appear'd in publick this Day, though the Rhinegrave, and many <HI>Holland</HI> Officers were at Court; and now we &s;peak not a Word of Marching, which before we were full of.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Ca&s;tlehaven</HI> is gotten into <HI>Steven&s;wert</HI> with five hundred <HI>Germans</HI>, for the Security of that Place, being a Fort upon the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI>, betwixt <HI>Ruremond</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;eyk</HI>, which he did by Com|mand from his Excellency; but now the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> is marched this way 'tis &s;aid he will be recalled from thence.</P>
<P>I was Ye&s;terday to wait upon Count <HI>Egmond</HI> with whom our Ma&s;ter de Camp General had been two Hours in private. After his Departure, I found the Count much di&s;contented, who told me in Confidence, that his Excellency would feign engage him to &s;tay here this Campaign, and to undertake the Care of this Place, by rea&s;on of his great Intere&s;t with the Nobility, Gentry, and Citizens, and with the Country in general; to which the Count has given an ab&s;olute Refu&s;al, unle&s;s he may have &s;uch a con&s;iderable Body of Hor&s;e and Foot with him, that he may not lo&s;e his Reputation by a &s;eeming Defence, when he is not in a Condition to make it good. He al&s;o told the Ma&s;ter de Camp General how he had often repre&s;ented his Condition to the Court of <HI>Spain</HI>, and al&s;o to his Excellency, that all his E|&s;tate was confi&s;cated in the <HI>French</HI> Dominions, his Woods to a hundred thou&s;and Guilders cut down and &s;old, that he was unable longer to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or bear up that Port that became his Quality, that no Care had been hitherto taken of him, nor the

lea&s;t Compen&s;ation given him, that at pre&s;ent he was re&s;olved to go into this Campaign with two Valets de Chambres, two Grooms, and two Foot|men, not having Hor&s;es to draw his Waggons, nor Money to provide them; that however he would &s;erve the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in Condition of a private Trooper, rather than &s;tay here in the Condition his Excellency propo&s;ed. This Pa&s;&s;age I thought fit to relate to your Lord&s;hip, having it from the Count's own Mouth, which I heard with much Sorrow and Regret, to &s;ee a Per&s;on of that great Nobility, Honour and Merit, reduced to &s;uch Extremities, whil&s;t other incon&s;iderable Per|&s;ons have what they plea&s;e.</P>

'Tis &s;aid, and that by good Hands, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> expre&s;&s;es great Di&s;&s;atisfaction at our Pro|ceedings, and taxes his Excellency not to have per|form'd his Promi&s;e in having Twenty five thou&s;and Men ready to take the Field when his Highne&s;s's Army &s;hould be ready; in&s;tead whereof, he &s;ays, he knows well his Excellency cannot draw above Ten thou&s;and into the Field&punc; and leave his Garri|&s;ons provided; whereas his Highne&s;s &s;ays he has over perform'd his Promi&s;e, having at this in&s;tant within the&s;e Territories Thirty thou&s;and effective Foot, Eight thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and Two thou&s;and Drag ons: And this I heard Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fario</HI> affirm Ye&s;terday $t Dinner. To this 'tis &s;aid his Excel|lency an&s;wers&punc; that he intended a con&s;iderable Bo|dy of the <HI>H$llanders</HI> to be put into our Garri&s;ons, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> to be drawn out; and that he likewi&s;e reckon'd upon the <HI>German</HI> Recruits who are not yet come up. How the&s;e Differences will he reconciled I cannot &s;ay; but this is certain that there is great Confu&s;ion in our Councils. All this Morning his Excellency has been in Council with the General Officers of his Army; but what Re&s;olutions are taken as to the Campaign are not yet publick. In all appearance we &s;hall not take the Field &s;o &s;oon as was expected, for our Troops that were come with Lieutenan$

General <HI>Agourto</HI> from <HI>Cambray</HI> as far as <HI>Valenci|ennes</HI> in order to join our Army here, are com|manded back again; and our Troops that were coming from <HI>Flanders</HI> hither are al&s;o counterman|ded. The Hor&s;es for our Train of Artillery and Carriages being very numerous, having eaten up all the Gra&s;s on that &s;ide the Town towards <HI>Vilvord</HI>, are now remov'd on the other &s;ide betwixt the <HI>Hall</HI> and the <HI>Flanders</HI> Ports; and when tho&s;e Mea|dows are de&s;troy'd, I know no other remove but into the <HI>French</HI> Quarters. The truth is, all &s;ober People are amazed at our Conduct, and cannot imagine what end we propo&s;e; for 'tis not to be believ'd that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> will fit &s;till, when the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI> is join'd, and in the interim we ruin our Country and do nothing. The Prince at pre&s;ent lies encamped with his Army a League on this &s;ide <HI>Charleroy</HI>, where they have plenty of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, having ama&s;&s;ed a va&s;t quan|tity at <HI>Binch</HI> and tho&s;e Quarters, that their Army cannot want. From <HI>Bouchain</HI> Letters &s;ay, that in <HI>Kenway</HI> and <HI>Landrecy</HI> great &s;tore of Provi&s;ions is made, and va&s;t quantities of Ammunition-bread baked, that all the Mills in the Towns and Coun|try round have Orders to grind Corn ince&s;&s;antly, which makes them judge the Prince will draw that way.</P>
<P>We know no more as yet of the Imperiali&s;ts than what I wrote in my la&s;t, only this, we hear they begin already to demand Pay, without which they will not only plunder the Country, which they do already &s;ufficiently, but they will quick|ly moulder away; and however we flatter our &s;elves, yet we are told, they will not advance much farther from their Borders than they are al|ready, being not at all de&s;irous of a conjunction
<PB N="26" REF="79">
with us; &s;o that upon the whole matter, the Opi|nion of the mo&s;t prudent Men is, that we &s;hall be nece&s;&s;itated in few Months to make a Peace, and that not upon &s;o good Terms as we might have done before the Campaign. For the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> (finding he is principally engaged in this War for our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that we are in no condition of doing what he expected and we promi&s;ed) &s;eems not &s;o eagerly to pre&s;s it as we imagin'd; and unle&s;s &s;ome extraordinary Succe&s;s at Sea &s;hould give him farther Encouragement, we believe he will proceed but very coldly; for &s;ome of his principal Officers &s;ay, if any Advan|tage be gotten at Land, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Imperia|li&s;ts</HI> will have it, and that their Army is like only to be weaken'd; and therefore we begin to be ap|prehen&s;ive that when our Country is wa&s;ted, and no more Sub&s;i&s;tance for his Army, he will then retire as he did the Winter-Campaign.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid that Orders are &s;ent after <HI>de Ruiter</HI> to proceed very warily and not hazard much; but we are here &s;o confident of his Succe&s;s, that it was hotly reported on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI>-night late, that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was be&s;ieg'd and no Men in it to make Defence, and on <HI>Wedne&s;day Calais</HI> was taken; and &s;o every Day a Sea-Port is taken with us.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Ca&s;tlehaven</HI> writes from <HI>Steven&s;wert</HI> of the 30^t^h pa&s;t, that he was there with Count <HI>Mansfe$$$</HI> and Five hundred <HI>Germans</HI> believing the <HI>French</HI> would have attack'd that Place; that accor|dingly he was putting all things there in the be&s;t Po&s;ture he could for their Defence, which his Ex|cellency had order'd him to make to the utmo&s;t, a&s;&s;uring him of Relief in ca&s;e it &s;hould be be&s;ie|ged; but that Fear being now over.

<P>I Am forced to write with great Uncertainty to your Honour, &s;ince our Councils here are &s;o ill founded, that what is re&s;olved one day is &s;et a&s;ide the next; for notwith&s;tanding the Re&s;olution taken on <HI>Friday</HI> la&s;t for the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Ar|my to pa&s;s the <HI>Canal</HI>, and to incamp on this &s;ide, as I then told your Lord&s;hip, yet the Prince, upon farther Con&s;ultation with his General Officers, and upon the Account the <HI>French</HI> Marquis gave him of the Place, that it lay very open to be attack'd, thought it not convenient to remove his Army, unle&s;s ours was al&s;o ready to march with him; and &s;o his Highne&s;s &s;till continues his Quarters, and has only changed &s;ome Towns for Refre&s;hment of his Army.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> being out with his Regiment brought in near thirty Pri&s;oners, and One hundred and twenty Hor&s;es belonging to Carriages and Baggage, which he took about three Leagues from <HI>Charleroy</HI>. The &s;ame Night a Party

of fifty Hor&s;e went out again, expecting another Booty, but had the Misfortune to fall in with a Party of Five hundred <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e, by whom they were all taken Pri&s;oners or kill'd; the &s;ame time the <HI>French</HI> pillaged and burnt the Village of <HI>Borche</HI> three Leagues from hence.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> at Noon a Pea&s;ant of <HI>Burgundy</HI> came hither with an Expre&s;s to his Excellency from the Governour there; he pa&s;&s;ed both the <HI>French</HI> Ar|mies, and yet e&s;cap'd &s;earching: The Contents of his Letters were kept very private, and none &s;uf|fer'd to di&s;cour&s;e with him, whereby we judge his News was not very plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>His Excellency is in daily expectation of an ex|traordinary Currier from <HI>Spain</HI>, with a Commi&s;|&s;ion for the Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> to be General of the Strangers here, and command all the Hor&s;e as Lieutenant-General under the Duke <HI>de Villa Her|mo&s;a</HI>, and that all other Lieutenant-Generals and Serjeant-Generals of Battel &s;hall obey him; and it is intended that he &s;hall command our Army of Hor&s;e this Campaign, if the Duke <HI>de Villa Her|mo&s;a</HI> can be prevail'd with to &s;tay and command here, which his Excellency much labours in. However, 'tis thought this new Command will make great Divi&s;ions in the Army, and that the two Lieutenant-Generals <HI>Agourto</HI> and <HI>de Vela&s;co</HI> will quit their Employments upon it, though 'tis cer|tain there is no Man here &s;o fit for that Employ|ment as the Prince.</P>
<P>The Di&s;gu&s;ts between his Highne&s;s and Excellen|cy rather increa&s;e than le&s;&s;en, and are like to be|get greater Difficulties in our Army, than any Op|po&s;ition from the <HI>French</HI>, his Highne&s;s continuing much di&s;&s;atisfied with the Weakne&s;s of our Army, and is re&s;olv'd, as 'tis &s;aid, not to divide his.

Whereupon his Ex|cellency in great Anger declar'd to all the Officers (&s;ince he had not found the Lieutenant-General at the Head of the Troops according to his Duty) that they &s;hould no more own him as Lieutenant-General, nor give any Obedience to him: And then farther &s;ignified his Plea&s;ure, That Prince <HI>Vaude|mont</HI> (whom he &s;tiled General of the Hor&s;e in <HI>Burgundy)</HI> &s;hould be own'd and obey'd by them as Governour of all the Cavalry, and to command them in chief next to the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI>, and his Excellency did then put him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Charge.</P>
<P>The next Morning the Lieutenant-General came to the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI>, and declar'd his Rea|&s;ons why he did not attend. And that as to the Affront his Excellency had put upon him, by en|deavouring to take away his Charge, he expected no better from him; but that it was given him by the King of <HI>Spain</HI>, and was not in his Excellency's Power to take from him. And that it might appear he would not retard his Maje&s;ty's Service in this Conjuncture, he was re&s;olv'd &s;till to continue his Charge, and obey Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> till his Com|plaint &s;hould be heard at the Court of <HI>Spain</HI>.</P>

<P>ON Saturday, being betwixt the two Po&s;ts, I took a Turn to <HI>Antwerp</HI> through the <HI>Holland</HI> Quarters to &s;ee in what Condition they were, and found them as likely Men to fight as I ever &s;aw, both Hor&s;e and Foot. The Country betwixt this and <HI>Antwerp</HI> is mi&s;erably wa&s;ted, all Provi&s;ions both for Hor&s;e and Man de&s;troy'd. In my Pa&s;&s;age I &s;aw thirty, forty, and fifty Soldiers in a poor Boor's Hou&s;e, and all upon free Quarter both for Hor&s;e and Man; &s;o that mo&s;t of the Boors being quite ruin'd have le&s;t their Habitations. Ye&s;terday the Prince began to march with his Army: All tho&s;e Troops that were quarter'd near <HI>Antwerp</HI>, are pa&s;|&s;ed over the <HI>Scheld</HI> to <HI>Willtbrook</HI>, and the Villages thereabout along the <HI>Canal</HI>, but &s;ome Regiments of Hor&s;e &s;omething higher into the Country, His Highne&s;s quarter'd the la&s;t Night at the Ca&s;tle of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vandernott</HI> at <HI>Sems</HI>, half an Hour from <HI>Malines</HI> towards <HI>Wellbrook</HI>. This Day the Army did not march; and in my Return hither this Mor|ning on Hor&s;e-back, I &s;aw &s;everal of their Regi|ments exerci&s;ing as I came along, his Highne&s;s not permitting any Days intermi&s;&s;ion without exerci|&s;ing, but when they are upon their March. The <HI>Ertez$land</HI> Troops are coming up to his Highne&s;s&punc; Army, being three Regiments of Hor&s;e, but what Foot I know not. 'Tis &s;aid his Highne&s;s will pa&s;s the <HI>Canal</HI> to morrow; and indeed it is time, for tho&s;e Quarters will not longer maintain them. Hi$ E$cellency has $$at to the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Am|$$$$</HI> to p$$pare all Materials ready for making:
<PB N="39" REF="92">
Bridge over the <HI>Scheld</HI> at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, and Boats and Timber are preparing accordingly.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, the Nephew to the <HI>Conde de Molina</HI> who is de&s;ign'd Amba&s;&s;ador from <HI>Spain</HI> to the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI>, parted hence with his Lady and Family for <HI>Holland</HI>, from whence he is to imbark in a States Man of War.</P>
<P>On Sunday about Two in the Morning Marquis <HI>d' A&s;&s;enlaer</HI> return'd hither, having fir&s;t been with Count <HI>Waldeck</HI> to give his Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> an Account of their Negotiation with Ge|neral <HI>Souches</HI> at <HI>Ruremond</HI>, where they met him on Friday la&s;t, and all three &s;ign'd a Paper, wherein all things relating to this Campaign were unani|mou&s;ly concluded between them, for the carrying on the War with their &s;everal Armies as being all but one in Intere&s;t. The <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> are to pa&s;s the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI>, and march this way, and Orders were given for making the Bridge before the Generals parted, and Ye&s;terday General <HI>Souches</HI> intended to begin his March. Great Preparations are making about <HI>Die&s;t</HI> and <HI>Louvain</HI>, and all tho&s;e Quarters, for baking Bread for that Army, who 'tis &s;aid will be about <HI>Die&s;t</HI> in few Days, and from thence are de&s;ign'd to pa&s;s towards <HI>Namur</HI>, and &s;o on towards <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> being all an open Cam|paign, and that way to enter <HI>France</HI>, and give a Diver&s;ion to the <HI>French</HI> Armies, whil&s;t we come on upon this &s;ide.</P>
<P>His Excellency having notice on Sunday-night, that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> had &s;en$ away Six thou|&s;and Hor&s;e towards <HI>Lille</HI>, in order as 'twas thought to march towards <HI>Ypre</HI>; he thereupon commanded Ye&s;terday-morning the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> with Two thou&s;and Hor&s;e to <HI>Gaunt</HI>, and to march on with all Diligence towards <HI>Ypre</HI> for Security of
<PB N="40" REF="93">
that Garri&s;on. His Excellency likewi&s;e &s;ent Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Richards</HI> the <HI>Burgoignian</HI> Collonel, being an old experienc'd Soldier, to go into <HI>Ypre</HI> for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Baron <HI>de Rock</HI> the Governour. But la&s;t Night his Excellency was a&s;&s;ur'd, that tho&s;e Six thou&s;and Hor&s;e were not gone that way, but wheel'd about on the other &s;ide of <HI>Mons</HI>, and that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> is with his whole Army very near it, and has taken up Po&s;ts at <HI>Roelx</HI>, and <HI>Chatteau d' Havre</HI>, and all round the Town; and has commanded all the Pea&s;ants both of <HI>Artois</HI> and <HI>Hannau</HI> to bring in Faggots to his Camp, as tho' he intended to be&s;iege it, which much amazes us; becau&s;e we cannot imagine he de&s;igns the be&s;ieging of that important Place, &s;o &s;trongly fortified, &s;o well mann'd and victuall'd, that there is want of nothing. There is in it the Regiments of <HI>Vaude|ment, Belle-Ro&s;e, Sermiento, Wargnies</HI>, and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>, be&s;ides many free Companies of Foot, with &s;ix Companies of Dragoons, and two Regiments of Hor&s;e; and therefore cannot conceive he intends to be&s;iege it, but only hovers there upon &s;ome other De&s;ign, unle&s;s the King him&s;elf &s;hould come in Per&s;on. I believe our Armies will now &s;ud|denly move, and watch the Motions of the <HI>French</HI>; and if they attack any Place, we are re&s;olved to relieve it, or hazard a Battel.</P>
<P>Our News from <HI>Burgundy</HI> of the 2^d in&s;tant, is, that <HI>Dole</HI> was then much &s;treighten'd, and mi|&s;erably batter'd with their Canon, and great hurt done with their Mortar-pieces, and that it was then believed it would be &s;urrender'd within fews Days, if not Hours.</P>
<P>His Excellency has di&s;po&s;ed of the Prince <HI>d$ Sa$m</HI>'s Regiment to the Prince's Lieutenant-Col|lonel, whereby he has quieted all Parties that
<PB N="41" REF="94">
pretended to it, it being his Right to have it.</P>
<P>A Ve&s;&s;el coming from <HI>Scotland</HI> with One hun|dred Men, being a part of the Recruits for Mar|quis <HI>Douglas</HI>'s Regiment, was taken by a Priva|teer of <HI>O&s;tend</HI>, and brought in thither; but ano|ther Ve&s;&s;el with treble her number got &s;afe into <HI>Dunkirk</HI>. His Excellency having notice of this, and that the Men were willing to &s;erve here, has &s;ent down Collonel <HI>Scot</HI> to <HI>O&s;tend</HI> with Orders to receive &s;uch as are willing to take Service, and to march with them hither, where they &s;hall be mu&s;ter'd in his Regiment. But his Excellency and Court talk very loud of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ending, or at lea&s;t permitting Recruits to go to the <HI>French</HI>.</P>

<P>ON Saturday the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> was di&s;|patched by his Excellency to General <HI>Souches</HI> to ha&s;ten his March, and to adverti&s;e him where the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s Army was. The &s;ame Day our
<PB N="42" REF="95">
Ma&s;ter de Camp General, Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI>, Count <HI>Waldec</HI>, Marque&s;s <HI>Mompelian</HI>, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> went with an <HI>E&s;corte</HI> of two thou&s;and Hor&s;e to find a convenient Place for incamping our Armies, where they unfortunately mi&s;&s;ed of &s;urprizing &s;even hundred Hor&s;e who were on the other &s;ide of <HI>Hall</HI>, as our Generals were on this &s;ide; and by their Scouts having timely di&s;cover'd our Body of Hor&s;e, they retired too &s;oon to be engaged, their Retreat being through an inclo&s;ed Country, and towards their Army, where they might have Ambu&s;cades laid. Our Generals all agreed to incamp our Armies at <HI>Tubi&s;e</HI>, a Vil|lage a League from <HI>Hall</HI> towards <HI>Mons</HI>, as being very advantageous for the Security of our Camp. On Sunday Morning a thou&s;and <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e, with &s;ome principal Officers, came to view the &s;ame Place where we had been the Day before, having, it &s;eems, receiv'd notice of our Intentions, which may now he probably alter'd, &s;ince his Ex|cellency was this Day advertiz'd, that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> decamped this Morning at two a Clock, and is march'd with his Array towards <HI>Tournay</HI>, and a great Body of Hor&s;e towards <HI>Aeth</HI>, to co|ver his March; and if this prove true, 'tis like|ly our Motion will follow his.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday his Excellency received an Expre&s;s from General <HI>S$uches</HI> that he began his March from <HI>Duren</HI> on Friday, and the &s;ame Night in|camped near <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI>, with Intentions to march on with all Diligence, by the way of <HI>Condrot</HI> towards <HI>Namur</HI>&punc; to which Place his Excellency has &s;ent Commi&s;&s;aries to provide fifty thou&s;and Rations of Bread tor that Army, and has al&s;o &s;ent Orders for great Quantities of Bread to be baked in all the adjacent Parts. It's de&s;igned the Impe|rial
<PB N="43" REF="96">
Army &s;hall pa&s;s the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> betwixt <HI>Namur</HI> and <HI>Huy</HI> at <HI>Anden</HI>, where a Bridge is preparing; and 'tis believ'd the Army will pa&s;s there to mor|row, or on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> at farthe&s;t. The Di&s;cour&s;e &s;till holds that they &s;hall march betwixt the <HI>Sam|bre</HI> and <HI>Meu&s;e</HI>, and that way enter <HI>France</HI>, whil&s;t our Army and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s &s;hall advance towards the new Conque&s;ts in <HI>Flanders</HI>; but this as yet is only &s;urmize. Ye&s;terday after Dinner his Excellency accompanyed with the Ma&s;ter de Camp General, Prince <HI>de Vaudemont</HI>, and Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> went to <HI>Fountain</HI> to meet his High|ne&s;s and his Generals, where they were in Coun|cil till nine at Night, and have finally agreed, as we hear, without any more Conferences, for the marching of both Armies. Our Train of Artille|ry, with our Ammunition Waggons, and twenty Waggons loaded with Pontoons, are all ready; and to morrow we expect four hundred Waggons, with three Hor&s;es in each, which are &s;ummon'd in from <HI>Alo&s;t, Dermond</HI>, and the <HI>Pais de Waes</HI>; &s;o &s;oon as they are all come we judge our Army will move; the Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> a&s;&s;uring an Of|ficer of Quality this Morning, that before the end of this Week our Armies would be marched from hence, expecting before our March the Arrival of the I$$$riali&s;t at <HI>Namur</HI>, and an Interview be|twix$, $word$ Excellency and General <HI>Souches</HI>. It is not $word$ certainly known whether his Excellency goes i$ Per&s;on into the Campaign; we &s;ee yet no $$&s;ible Preparations made for his own Train, which makes us judge that he will &s;tay here. The Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> is &s;till in <HI>Flanders</HI> with two thou&s;and Hor&s;e, at pre&s;ent betwixt <HI>Gaunt</HI> and <HI>Der$$o$d</HI> for the Refre&s;hment of his Troops, from whence no can quickly join our Army upon its $l$$ch.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="97">His Excellency has &s;ent into <HI>Guelderland</HI> for our old Troops that are there to march hither in all Diligence, which are a Regiment of <HI>Croats</HI>, the Regiment that was the Prince <HI>de Salm</HI>'s, and Baron <HI>de Yong</HI>'s Regiment of <HI>German</HI> Foot. 'Tis thought my Lord <HI>Ca&s;tlehaven</HI> will have Or|ders to come with them, which his Lord&s;hip much de&s;ires, being of no u&s;e where he is; and if he continues there, it may be concluded he is kept out of the way that he may not be privy to their Councils here.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> has taken lately a Review of his Army, which are &s;aid to be thirty two Re|giments of Foot, be&s;ides the two Marine Regi|ments which are here at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>, and tho&s;e in <HI>Flanders</HI>, and an hundred forty four Troops of Hor&s;e, and two thou&s;and Dragoons; &s;o that he will be in the Field effectively between thirty and thirty five thou&s;and Men. What our own Army will be, we cannot yet make any Judgment of, becau&s;e they are di&s;per&s;ed, and 'tis not yet decla|red publickly what Regiments &s;hall march.</P>
<P>The Boors in tho&s;e Parts where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are quartered (being infinitely oppre&s;&s;ed by them) have taken their Opportunities of killing &s;everal of them, who have been found murdred in the Woods; whereupon great &s;earch has been made, and Soldiers Cloaths found in &s;ome Boors Hou|&s;es, upon which his Highne&s;s has cau&s;ed four or five Boors to be executed.</P>
<P>We hear that all the Pri&s;ons of <HI>Mons</HI> are full of <HI>French</HI> Soldiers, that the Duke <HI>d' Ar&s;chott</HI> caus'd a general Mu&s;ter to be taken within the Town or all Per&s;ons able to bear Arms, which amount|ed to near thirty thou&s;and Men. We cannot learn the certainty of what Force the <HI>French</HI> Ar|my
<PB N="45" REF="98">
is; all the Pri&s;oners we take, and De&s;erters which come from them, report them &s;ixty thou|&s;and, which is more than a third part greater than we will give Credit to. But a Lieutenant of Hor&s;e of ours that was taken near <HI>Mons</HI>, and is &s;ent back hither, who &s;aw their Army all drawn up, judges them about forty thou&s;and Men, and tho&s;e as good Troops as he ever &s;aw</P>
<P>It has been whi&s;pered here &s;ince our la&s;t Or|der from <HI>Spain</HI>, that his Excellency had recei|ved &s;ome Check for permitting Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Motte</HI> and <HI>Samur</HI> (being only Pen-Men) to intermeddle in the Councils of War, and for intru&s;ting them more particularly in tho&s;e Affairs than his Gene|rals and great Officers, much to their Di&s;&s;atisfa|ction. And that which gives more Occa&s;ion to believe it, is, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Motte</HI> &s;ince that time has not been &s;o frequent in Councils as be|fore; and that his Excellency, to take him off from martial Affairs, has made him Pre&s;ident of the Chamner of Commerce, and has &s;ent Mon&s;ieur <HI>Samur</HI> to <HI>Gaunt</HI>, to be an A&s;&s;i&s;tant to Count <HI>Rhe|nenburg</HI>, who commands there in chief.</P>
<P>Letters from <HI>Ruremond</HI> of the 16^t^h &s;ay, That the <HI>Cologn</HI> Troops which lately revolted, after ha|ving killed mo&s;t of their Officers, and broken fifteen Standards, have di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>La&s;t Night Ma&s;ter <HI>de</HI> Camp <HI>Scot</HI> came hither with the &s;ixty <HI>Scotch</HI> Men that were taken at Sea by the <HI>O&s;tend</HI> Caper.

It &s;eems General <HI>Souches</HI> is re&s;olv'd not to come much farther into the&s;e Quarters, till he is a&s;&s;u|red his Army &s;hall want no Provi&s;ions; and we now &s;ay they will not advance till the Corn is nearer ripe, it being otherwi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible to find &s;ufficient Sub&s;i&s;tence for all our Armies&punc; In the mean time the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> continues &s;till a|bout <HI>Mons</HI>, &s;o mi&s;erably hara&s;&s;ing all that Coun|try, that there will be nothing left either for Man or Hor&s;e.

<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army continues &s;till where it was, and daily increa&s;es by taking in all De&s;erters, which his Excellency here will not permit. On Saturday I was at his Highne&s;s's Quarters at <HI>Semps</HI>, where there was no Appear|ance of marching, but an hourly Expectation for his Highne&s;s and Excellency to go per&s;onally to confer with General <HI>Souches</HI>, which upon &s;ome Con&s;ideration is as yet delay'd. I had a long Di&s;cour&s;e with Sir <HI>Walter Vane</HI>, who &s;eems of the &s;ame Opinion with General <HI>Souches</HI>, that there is not here a &s;ufficient Store of Provi&s;ions for their Armies, and that it would be ruinous for them to make any great Advance 'till the Corn be ripe. He was very inqui&s;itive to know really what Force his Excellency could &s;pare to join with them, a&s;|&s;uring me that his Highne&s;s would part with none of his Men to put into our Garri&s;ons; and that if his Excellency could &s;end four thou&s;and Hor&s;e, &s;ix thou&s;and Foot, and two thou&s;and Dragoons, they would expect no more; and doubted not, but with that Addition to do great things before the end of the Campaign. And we &s;hall now cer|tainly be able to draw into the Field ten or twelve thou&s;and Men, our Troops being come from <HI>Guel|derland</HI>, and our Recruits from <HI>Germany</HI> being upon their March. I have under&s;tood from very good Hands, that his Excellency has a great in|clination
<PB N="48" REF="101">
to be&s;iege <HI>Arras</HI>, as a Place of the grea|te&s;t Con&s;equence towards regaining our lo&s;t Towns in the&s;e Provinces, and it is not unlikely but that may be the fir&s;t De&s;ign we go upon.</P>
<P>On Sunday Night the Marque&s;s <HI>Mortaign</HI>, late Governour of <HI>Dole</HI>, came hither, who was very kindly receiv'd by his Excellency for &s;o well de|fending that Place. He gave his Excellency an Account that one of our Regiments that was there, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix hundred Men, had all taken Ser|vice with the <HI>French</HI>, both Lieutenant Collonel, Major, and &s;ix Captains, with their Officers and entire Companies.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday Morning our <HI>German</HI> Letters gave us an Account of a long and &s;harp Engagement be|twixt Mar&s;hal <HI>Turene</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>, who had with him Count <HI>Caprara</HI>, with &s;ome <HI>Saxon</HI> Troops. The Relation is differently repor|ted, but by a Letter of the 17^t^h from the Duke of <HI>Bournovile</HI> to his Secretary here, which I had the Favour to &s;ee. It is thus written in general Terms, That the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being inform'd that Mar&s;hal <HI>Turene</HI>'s Army and his were much about an equal Number, was re&s;olved to pa&s;s the <HI>Neckar</HI>, and to fight him if he oppos'd his Pa&s;|&s;age. That he had pa&s;&s;ed the River before the <HI>French</HI> came up, and being po&s;ted upon an advan|tageous Ground endured &s;everal Attacks, and could not be forced from it; but Mar&s;hall <HI>Turenne</HI> having fourteen thou&s;and Men, and the Duke but eight thou&s;and, the <HI>French</HI> having Canon, and the Duke none, he was after many Charges, and four Hours di&s;pute, forced to quit that Po&s;t; but retreated in &s;o good Order, &s;till bringing up the Rear him&s;elf, that he &s;aved all his Bag|gage, and &s;till fought as he retired; the <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="102">
pre&s;&s;ing very hard upon him, in&s;omuch that there was no Regiment there that charged not twice or thrice that Day; that towards the Evening he re|treated to a great Wood, where the Mar&s;hal <HI>Tu|renne</HI> thought be&s;t to leave him for fear of an Ambu&s;cade: And &s;o concludes, that the Engage|ment cea&s;ed more favourably to the <HI>French</HI> than the Duke, that many Officers of Quality were kill'd on the Duke's Side, and &s;o he believ'd on the <HI>French</HI>, and that the Lo&s;s was judged near e|qual, and that then he had no farther Particulars but that he was then drawing his Troops toge|ther, and going in Per&s;on to <HI>Heidelberg</HI>, and that being joined with the Duke, and the <HI>Palatine</HI> Troops, he doubted not of being quickly even with Mar&s;hal <HI>Turenne</HI>; which was the whole Sub&s;tance of his Letter. There is another relation from <HI>Co|logn</HI>, dated the 18^t^h in&s;tant, which is more parti|cular and long, and much to the Honour of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> in making &s;o brave a Retreat, being over-powered by a much greater Number, and &s;ays there was about two thou&s;and kill'd on both Sides.

<P>YE&s;terday the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> decamp'd from near <HI>Mons</HI>, and is march'd with his Army towards <HI>Tournay</HI> and <HI>Aeth</HI>. The la&s;t Night his own Quarters were at the Abbey of <HI>Cambron</HI> near <HI>Cheiure</HI>.

<P>Lieutenant General <HI>Agourto</HI> is come to <HI>Valenchien|nes</HI>, with 1500 Hor&s;e and Dragoons to be near the Rear of the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s Army.

<P><PB N="52" REF="105">The General had great Hopes to have frightned the States of <HI>Leige</HI> to have receiv'd an imperia$ Garri&s;on by telling them, that their City being a Member of the Empire, his Imperial Maje&s;ty expected they &s;hould have received his Army a$ Friends, and if they did not he mu&s;t look upon them as Enemies: That he could not but take not$ce of their having three hundred Men upon the Guard in every Port, when they had but te$ or twelve Men whil&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Army wer$ there, which &s;ufficiently te&s;tified their Inclina+tions; but he had as &s;mall Succe&s;s with his Arm as B$r$n <HI>d' I&s;&s;ola</HI> had with his Rhetori$k, exceptin$ only, that the States open'd their Pur&s;e-&s;trings which gave his Excellency &s;ome pre&s;ent Satisfa+ction.

<P>BY Letters from <HI>Cologn</HI> of the 29^t^h pa&s;t, we are told, that after Mar&s;hal <HI>Turene</HI> had reti|red to <HI>Philipsburgh</HI>, to refre&s;h his Army after the late Battle, he there cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhyne</HI>, and un|der&s;tanding the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> had withdrawn mo&s;t of the Garri&s;on from <HI>New&s;tad</HI>, he march'd thither, took it, and put a Garri&s;on of four hun|dred Men into it; and took al&s;o another &s;mall Place, which he burnt to the Ground, there be|ing a Ca&s;tle which had a Garri&s;on in it, which he could not force. It's written al&s;o, that his Army is much increa&s;ed &s;ince the Battle, by a Recruit of two thou&s;and five hundred Dragoons, be&s;ides Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vaubrun</HI>'s Troops who are joyn'd with him; that the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Army was about eight thou&s;and, be&s;ides the Forces of the <HI>Circle of Franconia</HI>, and the <HI>Palatinate</HI>, and in the whole would be about twenty thou&s;and Men; that he was marching from <HI>Ladenburgh</HI> towards <HI>Manheim</HI>, where he intended pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Rhine</HI>, b$$ng re&s;olv'd to provoke Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turene</HI> to a Battle if he would accept it. The &s;ame Letter &s;ays, that the 28^t^h pa&s;t, one thou&s;and five hun|dred Foot, five hundred Hor&s;e, and five hundred Dragoons of the <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> Troops pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhine</HI> near <HI>Mulheim</HI>, in order to their marching after the Imperial Army in the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>General <HI>Souches</HI>, with the Body of the Imperial Army, lies encamped on the other &s;ide o$ the <HI>M$u&s;e</HI> near <HI>Arden</HI>, where they are to p$&s;$ which he forbears till his whole Army be com$ up $word$

having been forced to file off &s;everal ways to pa&s;s through the rugged Country of <HI>Condrot</HI>; be&s;ides, all the <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> Troops are not yet come up to him, which, 'tis thought, he will expect there, before the Body of his Army pa&s;&s;es the River. His Army con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix Regiments and an half of Infantry, &s;ixteen Companies in each Regiment, and one hundred and fifty Men in each Company&punc; The Right Wing of their Infantry is commanded by the Prince <HI>Pio</HI>, the Left Wing by <HI>Vertmultez</HI>, who was General in <HI>Candia</HI>. They have ten Re|giments of Cavalry, twelve Troops in each Re|giment&punc; and eighty Soldiers in each Troop, which are commanded by the Prince of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and Ge|neral <HI>Spark</HI>, as Lieutenant Generals. Marque&s;s of <HI>Bade</HI> is General of the Ordnance, and they have fifty eight Pieces in their Train of Artillery; they have al&s;o the <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> Troops which they reckon at &s;ix thou&s;and Men, and in the whole they e&s;teem their Army thirty thou&s;and effective Men. But I &s;hall have a mo&s;t exact Account of their Army, and all their principal Officers, from their Adjutant General, which I hope to &s;end your Lord&s;hip by the next Order.</P>
<P>We are told by &s;ome of their Officers, that the Army is very unruly, and notwith&s;tanding the General u&s;es great Severity of Di&s;cipline, not a Day pa&s;&s;ing without &s;ome Execution, yet it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep them in order, they declaring&punc; That if every Tree in the Country were a Gibbet it &s;hould not hinder them from taking whatever they find, which is Man's Meat, whether dead o$ a$ive. And therefore the General &s;ent to his Ex|cellency her$, that notice might be given to the Coun$ry, th$t Cattle might be brought in for hi$ Army, with$ut which it would be impo&s;&s;ible t$
<PB N="57" REF="110">
keep them from ravaging the Country. And 'tis much feared, the Liberty which this <HI>German</HI> Army takes will quite &s;poil the Di&s;cipline of ours and the Prince's Army, if they &s;hall be near each other; to prevent which, his Excellency is publi&s;hing more &s;trict Placaerts than have been formerly for governing the Army. And his Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> u&s;es very &s;trict Di&s;cipline in his Army, the lea&s;t Fault not e&s;caping Puni&s;hment, which makes them begin to live more regularly.</P>
<P>On Saturday Night his Excellency's Guards of Hor&s;e marched hence, having Orders to carry with them four Days Provi&s;ions for them&s;elves and Hor&s;es, and with them went his Excellency's Led Hor&s;es, his Servants and Retinue, with his Waggons of Provi&s;ions, and went that Night to <HI>Louvain</HI>, whither on Sunday Morning his Excel|lency follow'd, with Marque&s;s <HI>A&s;&s;enlaet</HI> and Prince <HI>de Vaudemont</HI>, and arrived at the Cloy&s;ter of St. <HI>Gertrude</HI> in <HI>Louvain</HI>. About two in the Afternoon the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>, accompanied with Count <HI>Waldec</HI>, and many other principal Officers, pa&s;|&s;ed through <HI>Louvain</HI> with his Guards of Hor&s;e, and made no &s;tay, but marched on to <HI>Tirlemont</HI>, where his Excellency overtook him, and that Night, it was &s;aid, they were to meet Gene|ral <HI>Souches</HI> at a &s;mall Village not far from <HI>Tit|lemont</HI>, in the way to <HI>Namur</HI>. His Excel|lency had cau&s;ed all manner of Provi&s;ions to be carried for their Entertainment, and had two thou&s;and of his Hor&s;e, be&s;ides his Guards and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s for their Security, and One thou&s;and <HI>Curia&s;&s;iers</HI> were to come with Gene|ral <HI>Souches</HI>. Their Intentions were to return this Night, for &s;o I was told on Sunday at the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Quarters by Sir <HI>Gab. Silvius</HI>, who
<PB N="58" REF="111">
went with his Highne&s;s, and likewi&s;e by Sir <HI>Wal|ter Vane</HI>, who &s;tay'd behind by the Prince's Com|mand to take care of the Army. But we hear this Day, that they are gone forward to the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army to &s;ee it encamped, &s;o that we believe that neither his Highne&s;s nor Excellency will return till to morrow. Sir <HI>Walter Vane</HI> told me, after this Conference they &s;hould &s;uddenly enter upon A|ction, and their Army would march &s;o &s;oon as his Highne&s;s return'd; &s;o that I hope by the next I may give your Lord&s;hip an Account what Re&s;olu|tions were taken in this Conference.</P>
<P>On Saturday al&s;o went away from hence all the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI>'s Equipage for this Cam+paign, he being re&s;olv'd not to come hither til$ the Campaign be ended. All the Hand-mills tha$ can be found or made, are order'd to be bough$ up to carry with the Army for grinding Corn$ and all imaginable Preparations are making fo$ Provi&s;ions and Forrage for the Army, and it is th$ general Belief it will not be many Days before ou$ Armies &s;hall move.</P>
<P>We are a&s;&s;ur'd the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s Army con+tinues &s;till about <HI>Ch$$ure</HI> and tho&s;e Parts, and tha$ he has had con&s;iderable Recruits come to him but to what number we cannot, at lea&s;t are no$ willing to &s;ay; for we &s;till continue that Humou$ of undervaluing our Enemies, and will not believ$ them half the number that general Report make$ them. There is a Convoy of Three thou&s;and an$ odd hundred Waggons (of which the Country o$ <HI>Arra$</HI> furni&s;hed Two thou&s;and two hundred) com$ all &s;afe to the Army, and the Garri&s;ons near i$ The whole C$untry has been charged to &s;end i$ great Quantities of Cattel for the Army; and w$ are told the Contribution Land of <HI>Kennaway</HI> h$

given Two thou&s;and Cows in Specie, which is to be rebated out of their Contribution, according to the Value &s;et upon the Cattel by Per&s;ons ap|pointed at the Delivery of them; &s;o that now they have plenty of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, and we do not find that the De&s;erters come &s;o fa&s;t to us as they did.</P>
<P>His Excellency the Count <HI>Monterey</HI> has lately a|greed with the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> for Eight thou&s;and Men, who are to come hither for a Sup|ply of our Army, his Excellency having now &s;ent Money and all nece&s;&s;ary Orders for them; and we are a&s;&s;ured they are already upon their March, and will be here in &s;ix Weeks time at farthe&s;t; and though a good part of the Summer is pa&s;t, yet we reckon we &s;hall keep the Campaign for four Months intirely to come.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday</HI> la&s;t there having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome angry Words between Count <HI>Egmond</HI> and Count <HI>Me|rode</HI>, which came to his Excellency's Knowledge, he thereupon commanded them both in Arre&s;t, the fir&s;t to his Hou&s;e, the other to his Chamber, till they are reconciled.</P>
<P>The Bridge which his Excellency ordered to be made over the <HI>Scheld</HI> at <HI>Antwerp</HI> is fini&s;hed, the principal Occa&s;ion of it being for the more &s;pee|dy and &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age of Convoys with Provi&s;ions from the Pay <HI>de Waes</HI>, and th$&s;e Parts of <HI>Flan|ders</HI> for the Sub&s;i&s;tence of the Army.</P>

Whether this be our real De&s;ign I can|not yet &s;ay, but a few Days will give us more light; in the interim this is the be&s;t Account I am able to give.

<P>OUR la&s;t Letters from <HI>Germany</HI> tell us, that Mare&s;chal <HI>Turenne</HI> being reinforced with a con&s;iderable number of old Troops from <HI>Al&s;ace</HI> and <HI>Lorrain</HI>, had advanced upon the Army in the <HI>Palatinate</HI>, and forced them to retire from <HI>Laden|burgh</HI>, which he had po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; and that he was marched with his Army, con&s;i&s;ting of above Twen|ty thou&s;and effective Men of old Troops towards <HI>Manheim</HI>, in order, as 'twas thought, to be&s;iege it. Which Account does well agree with what the Duke of <HI>Bournovile</HI> has lately written hither to a private Friend, wherein he complains of his ill U&s;age in being &s;ent from the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army, which he had modelled with great Care and Difficulty, to command the Fragments of an Army compo&s;ed of many Parts, which cannot be got together; and much blames the Management of Affairs a|mong&s;t the Confederate Princes, in not &s;ending their allotted Supplies, whereby he is inforced to retire with the lo&s;s of his Reputation, and with Danger to the <HI>Palatinate</HI>. This Account gives the A&s;&s;urance of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turenne</HI>'s Victory in the late Battel, which we would by no means believe, ha|ving from time to time been deluded by the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive Relations we have received of the flouri&s;h|ing Condition of the Confederate Armies, magni|fying the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> Power there, and vilifying that of Mare&s;chal <HI>Turenne</HI>'s; which has &s;o fill'd our grave&s;t Heads here with vain and impertinent Hopes, that we will not yet believe what the Con|&s;equences make evident.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="117">After Mon&s;ieur <HI>Louvignie</HI>'s Return from Gene|ral <HI>Souches</HI>, and that he had given his Excellency an Account of the Advance of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army near <HI>Dinant</HI>, and of their pre&s;ent Po&s;ture and Re|&s;olutions, he went to give his Highne&s;s the like, and return'd the &s;ame Night with this Account from his Highne&s;s, that there was an indi&s;pen&s;ible Nece&s;&s;ity for his Army &s;uddenly to leave tho&s;e Quarters, &s;ince the whole Country was eaten up&punc; and that all their Hor&s;e were forced to feed upon green Corn which would de&s;troy them.</P>

<P>Several Reflections are made here upon the&s;$ our reiterated Delays, and all the World wonder$ at our backwardne&s;s, that nothing is done eithe$ by Sea or Land before this time; whereas th$ <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet might have given them a &s;trong an$ con&s;iderable Diver&s;ion on the other &s;ide, whill

the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army had made a vigorous Inroad up|on this, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s and our Army at the &s;ame time advanced into their new Con|que&s;ts of <HI>Flanders</HI>; and if we &s;hall &s;till let &s;lip all the&s;e Advantages which we might have made by &s;o happy a Conjuncture, it will make our Weak|ne&s;s more than ordinarily con&s;picuous. But the real Truth of our not moving &s;ooner, is, that all our Generals have declared it ab&s;olutely impracti|cable to march with &s;uch powerful Armies into an Enemy's Country till the Corn be ripe; which now drawing on apace, the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> are advan|cing, having decamped on Wedne&s;day Morning at Three a clock; but whether they will pa&s;s the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> at <HI>Givet</HI>, is not publickly known; the more received Opinion here is, that they will march by the way of <HI>Ba&s;toign</HI>, and &s;o to <HI>Treves</HI>, or el&s;e by <HI>Arton</HI>, and &s;o towards <HI>Lorrain</HI>; and it's believ'd one of the&s;e two la&s;t is their Intention: By the next I &s;hall be able to give your Lord&s;hip a more particular Account, of what at pre&s;ent we only &s;peak by Conjectures.</P>

<P>Before the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> marched, there was Mo|ney allotted them by his Highne&s;s and his Excel|lency together for a Month's Pay, which was ve|ry welcome to tho&s;e that had the good Fortune to receive it, who, 'tis thought, will convert mo&s;t of it to their own u&s;e.

<P>The Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> came hither early or Wedne&s;day Morning, and continues here &s;till having left his Troops in their Quarters abou$ <HI>Dendermond</HI>, who are ready to march at an Hou&s;$ warning.

<P>SInce my la&s;t, Mon&s;ieur le Prince decamped with his Army from about <HI>Aeth</HI>, and marched with it by <HI>M$us</HI> on Friday in the Afternoon, bending his Cour&s;e towards the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> to watch the Mo|tions of the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI>. His Head-Quarters at pre&s;ent is at the Abby of <HI>Bonne E&s;perance</HI>, near the <HI>Sambre</HI>, and the Rere-guard of his Army is po&s;ted at <HI>Mauvaige</HI> not far from <HI>Binch</HI>. We have an Account from tho&s;e who are well able to judge, who &s;aw his Army at the rendezvous, and upon their march, that there are &s;ixty Battallions of Foot, and One hundred and twenty Squadrons of Hor&s;e, which we reckon about Forty thou&s;and. But on Friday Night he &s;ent away &s;even or eight thou&s;and Men towards <HI>Rocroy</HI>, and tho&s;e Parts, for Reinforcement of &s;uch Garri&s;ons he &s;u&s;pects may be in mo&s;t danger.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t notice of his March that way, we were much alarm'd, fearing le&s;t he might get &s;ome Advantage of the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI>, having &s;o per|fect Knowledge of that Country; and therefore his Excellency di&s;patched three &s;everal Expre&s;&s;es on Saturday Morning in great Diligence to give General <HI>Souches</HI> notice of it, and afterwards his Excellency went to confer with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>; and after a Con&s;ultation had there, the <HI>R$$negrave</HI> was &s;ent to General <HI>Souches</HI> to let him know what new Re&s;olutions were taken. It &s;eems this &s;udden Motion of Mon&s;ieur le Prince, and the unexpected Succe&s;s of Mare&s;chal <HI>Turenne</HI> has much $lter'd our Mea&s;ures. For General <HI>Souhes</HI> (as we

hear) is nece&s;&s;itated to &s;end the third Part of his Troops to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Confederate Armies in the <HI>Pa|lumate</HI>, and has thereupon made a Halt with his Army about <HI>Dinant</HI> and <HI>Chiney</HI>, till he is reinfor|ced by a Conjunction with, or a large Supply from the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s and our Army, who are $$w de&s;igned that way, we beginning to be &s;ettled in point of Reputation; which being much le&s;&s;en'd already by our &s;o long lying &s;till, will be ab&s;olutely lo&s;t, if with &s;o much Preparation and with &s;o great Forces we &s;hould con&s;ume unprofi|tably a whole Campaign, which at fir&s;t did &s;eem to promi&s;e &s;o much Advantage and Glory to <HI>Spain</HI>, and threaten &s;o much De&s;truction and Ruin to <HI>France</HI>. And therefore after various Con&s;ultations, it is re&s;olved that all ways &s;hall be tried to force the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> to a Battel, and according to the Event of that to proceed afterwards to other Re&s;olutions; and with this De&s;ign both the Prince of <HI>O$ange</HI>'s and our Army are advancing directly towards the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>, not doubting but to engage the Prince in a Battel in &s;ix Day's time; the Succe&s;s whereof is &s;$ little d$ubted, that this Morning at the rendezvous of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army, $$$nt <HI>Waldeck</HI> told the Prince, he made no q$$&s;t$$$ $word$ in five Day$s time they &s;hould hav$ $span$ that his Highne&s;s &s;hould &s;ee that $rmy $span$ lo&s;t Reputation of the <HI>Hol|landers</HI>, and $span$ $$uld lo&s;e his right Arm, if that Army we$e $span$ $orious over the <HI>France</HI>.

<P>HAving Notice on Sunday that my Lord Am|ba&s;&s;ador <HI>Temple</HI> was coming hither in his way to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Camp, I went to <HI>Fontaine</HI> to wait upon his Excellency, who came in a Yatch from <HI>Holland</HI>. From <HI>Fontaine</HI> he &s;ent his Secretary to make a Compliment to his Excel|lency, and to de&s;ire an <HI>E&s;corte</HI> for his &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age to his Highne&s;s's Camp, intending to make no &s;tay in <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>, if Coaches could by any means be gotten. His Excellency return'd An&s;wer, that he was much m$ Lord Amba&s;&s;ador's Servant, and would return his Compliment upon his Arrival: But that for his going to the Camp, the Prince would be marched before he could arrive there, $$ither $$uld $word$ tell where his Highne&s;s could be $word$ $$t that my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador's be&s;t way would be $word$ return back to <HI>Malmes</HI>, and from th$n$e to <HI>$$$mont</HI>, which he might do without
<PB N="73" REF="126">
an <HI>E&s;corte</HI>, and that there he might likely hear of the Prince. This dry An&s;wer much &s;urpriz'd his Excellency, &s;ince his rerurn to <HI>Malines</HI> was to lo&s;e a Days time, that being farmer from <HI>Tirle|mont</HI> than <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>, and that which added to his Trouble, was, that no Coaches were to be had till the next Day; whereupon I propo&s;ed to his Excellency, that notwith&s;tanding it was late, and the ways in&s;ecure, I would adventure to the Prince's Camp by the way of <HI>Louvain</HI>, and would the next Morn$n$ meet his Lord&s;hip at <HI>Louvain</HI>, and bring his Highne&s;s's An&s;wer. And accordingly I went, but his Highne&s;s being marched in the beginning of the Night, I follow'd him, and not without Difficulty overtook and found his Highne&s;s about twelve at Night, two Leagues from <HI>Louvain</HI>, up|on a very ha&s;ty March; where his Highne&s;s ha|ving no means to read the Letter, demanded whe|ther I knew any of the Contents; to which I re|ply'd, My coming was to intimate to his High|ne&s;s my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador's Arrival, and that he would be the next Morning at <HI>Louvain</HI>, to re|ceive his Highne&s;s's Directions when and where he might attend him. To this his Highne&s;s told me, He knew not but that he might be twelve or fourteen Hours on Hor&s;eback, and perhaps many Miles from that Place, and that therefore it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to &s;ay where his Excellency might find him. And when I pre&s;&s;ed to know whether <HI>Tirlemont</HI> was not a convenient Place, his Highne&s;s told me that was the likelie&s;t Place to hear of him; but I found by his Di&s;cour&s;e that he had no great mind to &s;peak at this jun|cture of time with his Excellency, le&s;t perhaps it might create a Jealou&s;ie in the <HI>Spaniards</HI>, who $tick not to &s;ay that his Excellency's coming mu&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="127">
needs be in Order to Propo&s;als of Peace, which they &s;eem unwilling now to hearken to. His Highne&s;s told me farther, that if I would return to his Quarters at <HI>Park</HI>, in my way back, there I &s;hould find Sir <HI>Gabriel Silvius</HI> who was to march after him the next Day, and that I might di&s;|cour&s;e the Bu&s;ine&s;s farther with him, and his Ex|cellency take his Mea&s;ures accordingly. And &s;o from thence I went to <HI>Park</HI>, and wakened Sir <HI>Ga|briel</HI>, and gave him an Account of the Amba&s;&s;a|dor's coming, but could find no Encouragement from him for his Excellency's going forward; for he told me his Highne&s;s was marching with great Secrecy and Diligence, with all his own and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cavalry, towards <HI>Namur</HI>, there to join with five thou&s;and Hor&s;e of General <HI>Souches</HI>'s Ar|my, who had receiv'd Orders to pa&s;s the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> that Night at <HI>Namur</HI>, and that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ca|valry were marched the neare&s;t way, in order to their &s;peedy Conjunction with them, le&s;t the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> being but four Leagues from them &s;hould fall upon them before the Body of the Army could come up, and that therefore the De|&s;ign had been carryed with all imaginable Secre|cy; and that his Highne&s;s, with all his Cavalry, was ha&s;tening that way, to be ready to &s;econd them upon any Occa&s;ion, and that the Foot were to march Ye&s;terday Morning at three, which ac|cordingly they did, and that it was hop'd Ye&s;ter|day by Noon the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and Imperial Cavalry were join'd, and that his Highne&s;s with his Army hoped as this Day to be up with them, and &s;o jointly to advance towards the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>; and that being united they &s;hould be eighteen thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and twenty two thou&s;and Foot effective.

<P>La&s;t Night at twelve his Excellency parted hence after the Army; his going was carry'd with &s;uch Secrecy that it was not known till Night, and then Orders were &s;ent to the Nobili|ty and Officers about the Town to accompany his Excellency.

This Relation put us here in much Di&s;order, e&s;pecially a continued number of People coming from the Army in a great Confu&s;ion, and giving &s;uch imperfect Relations, that we know not what Credit to give to them, &s;ince no Expre&s;s was come from the Army, nor one <HI>Spaniard</HI> or <HI>German</HI> &s;een a|mong&s;t them, which made us hope our Armies were intire and fighting. The &s;ame Day after Dinner came &s;everal <HI>Dutch</HI> Waggons, and a|mong&s;t them one of Sir <HI>Walter Vane</HI>'s, and two of my Lord <HI>Clare</HI>'s, who&s;e Servants came to me to get Admittance into the Town, Orders being given to refu&s;e Entrance.

That the &s;hooting continued till Eleven at Night, the Heavens &s;eeming all on Fire: That on Monday Morning early they came from <HI>Ni|velle</HI>, and heard &s;hooting till they came within a League of this Place, but not &s;o violent as on Sa|turday. The&s;e di&s;mal Relations one after the other gave the whole Town no &s;mall Perplexity, all People thronging to the <HI>Namur</HI> and <HI>Hall</HI> Port to hear News. At la&s;t about Ten at Night came an Expre&s;s from his Excellency, being one of the Under-Secretaries, who brought an Account to her Excellency, that our Armies had gained a great Victory, kept the Field, and beaten the <HI>French</HI> with great Lo&s;s into their Camp, pur&s;uing them to their Trenches: That this Victory had co&s;t dear, many brave Officers lo&s;t, and &s;ome thou&s;ands of Soldiers on both &s;ides; but that the <HI>French</HI> had much the greater Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The manner his Excellency's Letter related the Battel was thus: That the <HI>French</HI> in a very advan|tageous Place had from a Wood attacked our Rear|guard, cut in pieces &s;ome Squadrons of Hor&s;e, and Battallions of Foot, and had pillaged mo&s;t of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Carriages; but that our Army turning Head upon them as fa&s;t as the Ground would permit, they were pre&s;ently re|pul&s;ed: That Mon&s;ieur le Prince having &s;ent Six thou&s;and Hor&s;e to &s;econd this Body, they were &s;o far engaged by our Cavalry, that fre&s;h Troops were &s;ent to &s;uccour them; and &s;o in fine, one Supply was &s;ent after another till the whole Ar|mies became engaged, and that in &s;o bloody a Battel, that the like has not been known in the&s;e Countries: That &s;ome thou&s;ands are kill'd on our part, but more of the Enemies: That many Offi|cers of Quality were kill'd, and many mi&s;&s;ing,

and among&s;t them our Ma&s;ter de Camp General Marquis <HI>A&s;&s;enlaer</HI>, and Prince <HI>de Salm:</HI> That the Regiment of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> was cut in pieces, having endured the fir&s;t Shock of the <HI>French</HI> Fury: That we were intirely Ma&s;ters of the Field; and in ca&s;e the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> did not retire from his Camp, they intended to attack him, and force it. This was the Sub&s;tance of &s;o much of his Excel|lency's Letter, as the Marquis <HI>d' O&s;&s;$ra</HI> (who commands in his Ab&s;ence) was pleas'd to commu|nicate to &s;ome principal Officers for their general Satisfaction; but I am told, there were other Par|ticulars not &s;o &s;atisfactory, which were conceal'd. This News was that Night carried to the Magi|&s;trates, who were a&s;&s;embled in the Town-Hou&s;e, and all the City rung of the Victory. Ye&s;terday there was great Rejoicing, and the Victory was magnified to that degree, according to Men's &s;e|veral Inclinations and Inventions, that I have ne|ver heard &s;uch Romantick Stories told: That af|ter the <HI>Germans</HI> had made a prodigious Slaugh|ter of the <HI>French</HI> without their Camp, in the Night in great Fury they attack'd the Line, &s;ur|mounted all Difficulties, and gain'd the Enemies Camp, Cannon and Baggage: That Mon&s;ieur le Prince with &s;ome poor Fragments were e&s;caped to <HI>Ch$r$$$$</HI>, where he was be&s;ieged; and that Eight th$ u&s;$$d <HI>German</HI> Cavalry were following the <HI>French</HI>, who fl$$ over the <HI>Sambre</HI> towards <HI>Ro|$$oy:</HI> That the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI> was mortally wounded, and taken Pri&s;oner, the Duke of <HI>Lux|em$u$gh</HI> and M. <HI>R$$heford</HI> (and <HI>Bellefond</HI> that ne|ver was th$re, kill'd; and the&s;e Stories related at Court, and in all Places by Officers and others, and counterfeit Letters written from the Camp produced of it, that I pre&s;ume by the la&s;t Night's

<P>Our great Coun&s;ellors and Politicians were al|ready concluding the Peace, and that nothing le&s;s than reducing the <HI>French</HI> King to the Peace of <HI>Worms</HI> would be accepted, that of the <HI>Pyrenneans</HI> to be &s;et a&s;ide as well as that of <HI>Aix</HI>. The&s;e Things I do affirm &s;eriou&s;ly to your Lord&s;hip were &s;poken in my hearing Ye&s;terday at Dinner, by &s;ome of the great Council of <HI>Brabant</HI>. Ye&s;ter|day in the Afternoon about Three came another Expre&s;s from his Excellency, which being in Cy|pher took up &s;o much time, that we knew no|thing of it but in general Terms that it was a Confirmation of the Victory, but &s;omething more moderated than before: By this time our Heat began a little to cool; and at Night there came to my Lodging a Gentleman of <HI>Nivelle</HI>, of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Launoy</HI>, a &s;ober Per&s;on, and always well affected to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t; and he a&s;&s;ur'd us, that whatever Relations we had of the greatne&s;s of the Victory, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> &s;till continued in his Camp, had taken many Pri&s;oners, much Booty, many Colours, and as &s;ome &s;aid Cannon: That our Armies were gone towards <HI>Mons</HI>, his Excellency retiring that way when the Battel be|gan, where he might hear it, and have an Ac|$ount given him without Danger: That he was $$pre&s;ent in or near <HI>Mons</HI>, and his Highne&s;s the $rince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s and General <HI>Souches</HI>'s Armies $camped about <HI>Mons</HI>, and betwixt that and <HI>$$nch</HI>.

<P>What farther Mea&s;ures our Armies will take is not known; but 'tis much fear'd the lo&s;s and want of &s;o many principal Officers who are wounded, may &s;omething retard, if not change the Re&s;olutions they had taken.</P>

<P>WE are as yet every Day more than other in the dark as to our great Victory, which is related &s;o many ways that &s;ober Men begin much to doubt the Truth of it. I have &s;poken with &s;eve|ral Officers of Quality of our Side, prudent, well-temper'd Men, that were in the Battle, the&s;e &s;ay they believe we had a Victory, becau&s;e our Ge|nerals tell them &s;o, otherwi&s;e they &s;ee no Foun|dation for it. That if we had a Victory, it was
<PB N="94" REF="147">
managed to our eternal Di&s;honour, becau&s;e, the Battel continuing 'till Midnight, we did not &s;tay 'till the Morning, but marched off from the Place of Battel before Day, without Sound of Trum|pet or Drum beating, leaving not only our dead and wounded Men upon the Field, but the Pil|lage of the Field to the <HI>French</HI>, who came early again on Sunday Morning upon the Place of Bat|tel, had the Pillage of the Field, and continued there to carry off their dead and wounded Men, wherein two hundred Waggons were employed all that Day; whil&s;t our Men were left wounded and dying without A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to the great Scan|dal of our old Generals, it being not only an O|mi&s;&s;ion of Con&s;equence in point of Conduct and Reputation, but al&s;o in point of Humanity, to leave &s;uch Numbers of poor wounded Creatures to the Mercy of our Enemies, whil&s;t we cry'd up our &s;elves victorious. But the truth is, our Ge|nerals (being mo&s;t wounded, or perfectly tired out with that Days Action) con&s;idered not what was fit to be done till they had marched a League from the Place of Battel, and then it was not thought Prudence to march back to hazard our Armies. The Fault of this, and &s;ome other Mi&s;|carriages that Day, are &s;aid to be laid to Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> Charge, again&s;t whom his High|ne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was &s;o much inraged, that we are informed he told him, That the King of <HI>France</HI> was more obliged to him in this Battle than the King of <HI>Spain</HI>. And that which makes us the more credit this Relation, is, that Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> is come hither two Days &s;ince, in great Trouble ana Di&s;content. It is acknowledg|ed by all Per&s;ons, that the Courage and Conduct of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was that day to be ad|mir'd,
<PB N="95" REF="148">
who flew from one part of the Field to another, not only to encourage his Men, but from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t of the &s;everal Engagements, and in the Heat of every Attack, was the fore|mo&s;t, and has thereby gain'd immortal Honour. It's &s;aid al&s;o, that Mon&s;ieur le Prince never de|&s;igned any Battle with greater Skill, nor managed it with more Conduct; and that when all Parti|culars &s;hall be fully known, this will be e&s;teem'd one of the greate&s;t and brave&s;t Actions of his Life.</P>
<P>The Relations which I herewith &s;end, are the be&s;t and mo&s;t pertinent of any come to my Hands, and the true&s;t to &s;o much as they relate; it being impo&s;&s;ible for any (though upon the Place) to give an exact Relation of all Particu|lars, becau&s;e they were attacked in &s;o many &s;e|veral Places. By the next Po&s;t I hope to &s;end your Lord&s;hip a very particular Account as to the Lo&s;s of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Side, though I pre&s;ume your Honour will receive a much better by the inclo&s;ed from Sir <HI>Gabriel Sylvius</HI>, being upon the Place, than any other can give. I have under&s;tood by &s;everal <HI>Holland</HI> Officers, who came hither to recruit them|&s;elves after their Lo&s;s, that they really believe their Army is le&s;&s;ened ten thou&s;and Men by this Engagement, in tho&s;e that are killed, wounded, taken, and run away; thirty five or &s;ix kill'd in &s;ome Companies, be&s;ides the wounded, and twenty four or five in the lea&s;t, which made them very angry la&s;t Night when the Guns went off for the Victory, and &s;aid they did really believe the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> would hardly give the States an Account of &s;o great a Victory as we made it here.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="149">Our Armies are at pre&s;ent encamped near <HI>Mons</HI>, his Excellency with our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops at St. <HI>Sympho&s;ion</HI>, the Imperiali&s;ts nearer to <HI>Binch</HI>, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s near him on the other Hand. All our Armies being now together en|camped in Battalia, in open Campaign, upon the Plains near <HI>Binch</HI>, ready upon the fir&s;t Allarm to draw to Battel. All our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops that can be &s;pared are drawn out of our &s;everal Gar|ri&s;ons in <HI>Hainault</HI>, and we have now a con&s;ide|rable Body of our own Foot together. On Wedne&s;day Night Lieutenant General <HI>Agourto</HI> went out with three thou&s;and Hor&s;e and two thou&s;and Foot, but upon what De&s;ign is not known.

There are &s;ome Thoughts that he may look towards <HI>Grave</HI>, but being &s;o far off we can|not believe he will abandon <HI>France</HI> whil&s;t our Armies are &s;o near it. We are told, how true I know not, that the King of <HI>France</HI> is very angry at the Prince's coming to a Battle, believing he might ea&s;ily have retreated with the Baggage, af|ter he had defeated the Rear of our Army, with|out coming to any farther Engagement.</P>
<P>We hear from our Camp that the <HI>French</HI> ac|knowledge to have lo&s;t eight thou&s;and Men in the Battel, and that ours is incon&s;iderable to it; much undervaluing our own, but very dextrous $n mag$$fying our Enemies Lo&s;&s;es; and though $ef$re the Batt$l we would not acknowledge the <HI>Fr$n$h</HI> a$ove thirty five thou&s;and, yet now we $ffirm them $orty five thou&s;and I was told $span$ a Maj$r $word$ the <HI>Holland</HI> Army, that $word$ Highne&s;s's Regim$nt of Foo$-Guards, the $eg$ments of P$ince <HI>Maurice</HI>, the Duke of $word$ <HI>de Pal$$, $word$, L$r$d$f</HI> and <HI>Ver&s;$</HI> $

<P>We are told al&s;o by &s;ome Officers, that are Pri&s;oners in the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s Camp, that he highly complains again&s;t the barbarous Cruelty of the <HI>Germans</HI>, not only killing many Per&s;ons of Quality that begged their Lives, but &s;everal Officers after they were Pri&s;oners, which was a Cruelty beyond that of Turks; that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> had written to General <HI>Souches</HI> concerning it, and bad no other An&s;wer, but that his Men had been u&s;ed to fight with Turks, and &s;o could not leave that Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>We talk here, as if the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e <HI>Ger|man</HI> Troops that are at the Siege of <HI>Grave</HI> &s;hould be ordered to march hither; but hearing nothing of that from <HI>Ruremond</HI>, I know not how to give credit to it.

<P>ON Monday in the Afternoon a Council of War was held by his Highne&s;s, with the &s;e|$eral Generals of our Armies, at <HI>Mons</HI>, in the Lodgings of Count <HI>Waldec</HI>, who&s;e Wounds will not permit him &s;o &s;uddenly to take the Field as was hoped; but the Prince of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was &s;o well as $o be at the Council, and begins to walk abroad. The Re&s;ult of this great Council is not made $ublick, but our Armies &s;till continue their Po&s;ts $bout St. <HI>Ghi&s;lain</HI> and <HI>Kieuraing</HI>, without attempt+$$g any thing, and are not like to advance till his $ighne&s;s's Army be recruited with &s;everal Nece&s;|$$ries they want, which were lo&s;t in the late Bat|$$l, and particularly with a great Sum of Mo|ney

coming from the States, which is not yet arrived here; neither dur&s;t our Convoy &s;tir from hence, being adverti&s;ed that Six thou&s;and <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e were roving about <HI>Nivelle</HI>, waiting to in|tercept it: And Ye&s;terday Morning about Two our Scouts brought word that a great Body of <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e were marching within three Leagues of this Place; which gave us &s;o hot an Allarm, that in great Confu&s;ion we drew all our Waggons and Carriages, with our Hor&s;e-guard al&s;o within the Barriers of <HI>Andernech</HI> Port, where they &s;till continue.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day Night three Regiments of <HI>Dutch</HI> Infantry came from <HI>Ypres</HI> to <HI>Gaunt</HI> in their way hither, and 'tis &s;aid more are following; but we are not yet certain whether they &s;hall march to the Army with the Convoy, or &s;tay here, and the three <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Regiments go in their &s;tead, who have receiv'd Orders to be ready to march upon the fir&s;t notice. In the mean time our Armies lie &s;till, do nothing but harra&s;s the Country, and dimini&s;h daily more and more, the Flux raging much among&s;t them; of which yet there is not &s;$ much danger, as of the di&s;agreeing Humours o$ our Generals, and of the particular Factions a+mong&s;t them, which increa&s;e more than the$$ Di&s;ea&s;es; and this was &s;een mo&s;t evidently i$ their late Council of War, where, 'tis &s;aid, the broke up in Confu&s;ion, without coming to an$ Re&s;olution, our late Victory having much incre$+&s;ed our Differences among&s;t our Generals; an$ the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> are now much blam'd for the Mi$+fortune that happen'd to us in the beginning of t$$ Battel, becau&s;e they march'd &s;o far before t$$ re&s;t of the Army, without making any Halt, a$$ took up their Quarters, and &s;ent out their For+gers

as being unconcern'd, whil&s;t the other part of our Army was engag'd many Hours before they came to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<P>This we have from very good Hands, with this farther, that his Highne&s;s and General <HI>Souches</HI> will not attempt any thing again&s;t the Enemy, whil&s;t his Excellency continues in the Camp, who, if he had &s;tudied to promote the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Intere&s;t, he could not have done it more effectu|ally than by going into this Campaign; and the more he finds his Pre&s;ence di&s;ta&s;tful to the Ge|nerals, the more re&s;olv'd he &s;eems to &s;tay; by which your Lord&s;hip may ea&s;ily judge in how ill a Po&s;ture our Affairs &s;tand; it being the Opinion of the mo&s;t &s;ober and unbia&s;s'd Per&s;ons, that we &s;hall do as little by Land, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet have done by Sea, for the Sea&s;on of the Year changes apace; and whatever we pretend as to be&s;ieging any Place, there is little appearance of it, whil&s;t Mon&s;ieur le Prince has &s;o con&s;iderable an Army in the Field; who, if he be not able to rai&s;e the Siege, will at lea&s;t hinder all Convoys to our Armies, and by that means put us in a wor&s;e Condition than the Be&s;ieged: And for our making a Winter War, which we &s;ay is the <HI>Ger|mans</HI> Trade, there is le&s;s Appearance how that can be done, &s;ince our Armies can &s;carce find Sub&s;i&s;tence in the Summer; neither can I ima|gine, as far as I am able to judge, where our Armies can take up their Winter-Quarters; I am &s;ure the&s;e Provinces are not able to maintain them: And if we cannot carry the War &s;o far

<P>Since the Arrival of our la&s;t Orders from <HI>Spain</HI>, our Di&s;cour&s;es are all for Peace, which that Court, as we are told, &s;eems much inclin'd to, by the urgent Interpo&s;ition of his Maje&s;ty, as al&s;o by the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of their own Affairs, which &s;ucceed not &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly as they ex|pected: And we hear from the Camp, that Peace is more their Di&s;cour&s;e than War, our Confede|rates beginning to be weary of it, fore&s;eeing the Difficulties that will daily grow upon them; and the&s;e Adverti&s;ements come from the be&s;t Hands in the Army.</P>
<P>I was this Day a&s;&s;ured from Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Vil|lette</HI>, one of the four Members of <HI>Flanders</HI> who came Ye&s;terday from our Camp, and is a Man much intru&s;ted and privy to their clo&s;e&s;t Coun|cils, that we &s;hould make a Peace before this Winter's ended, there being no likelihood of our making any Advantage by the War; that the only Difficulty is their great Jealou&s;ie that the King of <HI>France</HI> will break it &s;o &s;oon as he finds Occa&s;ion. But their great Confidence in his Maje&s;ty's Care for the Pre&s;ervation of the&s;e Pro|vinces to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI>; and his continual good Inclination towards them, do induce all the Members of the&s;e Provinces to &s;ubmit to his

<P>On Sunday Evening his Excellency very unex|pectedly return'd hither, with all our Nobility that attended him this Campaign, with a Safe|guard of Three thou&s;and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e comman|ded by the Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI>. 'Tis confidently &s;aid at Court, that his Excellency after he hath &s;ettled &s;ome Affairs of the Country, intends to return again to the Camp within a &s;hort time; and I am told in confidence, that either to mor|row in the Evening, or on Thur&s;day Morning, he goes for <HI>Antwerp</HI>, and from thence to <HI>Gaunt</HI>, which is kept very &s;ecret; and by the marching of &s;ome of our Troops that way which came with his Excellency, it's thought that either <HI>Oude|nard</HI> or <HI>Courtray</HI> will be be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday his Excellency cau&s;ed the Hor&s;es of all the Waggons that could be found here to be arre&s;ted, and not &s;uffer'd to depart, till the Con|voy was &s;ufficiently provided with Hor&s;es; neither is the Arre&s;t as yet taken off. How far the Con|voy goes this Night is not declared; but I pre&s;ume they are only to draw together not far from the Town, and &s;o put in order ready to march early in the Morning. All our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Infantry, with the Hor&s;e that were here, have Orders to march, and &s;ome hundreds of Pioneers, and great quan|tity of Ammunition; but upon what De&s;ign I am not yet able to &s;ay, farther than that we &s;hall at|tempt &s;ome Siege; for &s;o I am inform'd from the

The Prince of <HI>Curland</HI> came hither la&s;t Night in his way towards our Camp attended with a very hand&s;om Train and Equipage, and is this Day gone with Major General <HI>Fario</HI> under the Con|voy: His Regiment is at the Siege of <HI>Grave</HI>, which has only the Name of being be&s;ieged, very little or no Progre&s;s being made in it, as I under|&s;tood from one of his Gentlemen that came from thence.</P>
<P>Our Confederate Armies are at pre&s;ent incam|ped between <HI>Kieuraing, Conde</HI>, and <HI>Valenciennes</HI>; and 'tis written from thence, that &s;o &s;oon as this Convoy ari&s;es, they will go upon &s;ome con&s;idera|ble Action; the Money for his Highne&s;s's Army is al&s;o gone with this Convoy, under the Care of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Beaumont</HI>.</P>
<P>There is &s;o great Scarcity of Forrage near our Camp, that the Forragers are fain to go every Day between three and four Leagues, where they are taken in great numbers by the <HI>French</HI>, be&s;ides tho&s;e who take that Opportunity of de&s;erting, which they do very much for want of Provi&s;ions, no Week pa&s;&s;ing without our Armies wanting Bread a Day or two, and Beer as thick as Puddle, at eight Stivers a Quart throughout the Camp, and very &s;carce to be had. Great Complaint is made by our Confederates, that &s;ince we have been &s;o long preparing for this Campaign, there was not &s;ufficient Magazines of Ammunition and Stores of Provi&s;ions laid up in the &s;everal Garri&s;ons of <HI>Hainault</HI>, which we knew would be the Seat of War. But that to the hazard of our Convoys, to the un&s;ufferable Fatigue of our Ca|valry, and to the great Lo&s;s of Time, we are ne|ce&s;&s;itated to have all our Convoys both for Am|munition
<PB N="112" REF="165">
and Provi&s;ion from hence, never any War being laid upon &s;o weak and tottering a Foundation. The&s;e and many other Particulars, wherein 'tis loudly &s;aid, his Excellency has fail'd, are the cau&s;e that he is very &s;harply cen&s;ur'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers in general, (and al&s;o by our own) who &s;tick not to make it their Table Di&s;cour&s;e here, even within the Smell of the Court, affir|ming, that if his Excellency returns again to the Army, there will be an end of the Campaign as to any Action; not one Day having pa&s;s'd whil&s;t his Excellency was there, without &s;ome vi&s;ible di&s;ta&s;te or other betwixt his Excellency and &s;ome of the Generals: And that his Highne&s;s is re&s;olv'd to attempt nothing, until his Excellency make good his Word, &s;o far at lea&s;t as to &s;end Fifteen thou&s;and Men into the Field.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t his Excellency was in the Camp he pre|tended to give the Counter-&s;ign each Night, be|cau&s;e the Prince gave the Word, which his High|ne&s;s would by no means permit, to the great di|&s;ta&s;te of his Excellency; neither indeed is there any much better Corre&s;pondence between his High|ne&s;s and General <HI>Souches</HI>, who &s;eems un&s;atisfied that his Highne&s;s &s;hould carry all the Honour of this War; which certainly is far le&s;s than he me|rit, it being an undoubted Truth, that if in the late Battel his Highne&s;s had not &s;hew'd a mo&s;t ex|traordinary Courage and Conduct, our Armies had been all de&s;troy'd And if a <HI>German</HI> Collo|nel, who commanded &s;ome Battallions of Foot, ha$ not di&s;$en&s;ed with General <HI>Sou$hes</HI>'s Orders, and immediately obey'd his Highne&s;s it would have been a fa$al Day to our Army: But the Col|lonel &s;eeing the Nece&s;&s;ity of it, told his Highne&s;s though General <HI>Souches</HI> had given him Orders no
<PB N="113" REF="166">
to quit that Station, yet he would for once di&s;o|bey him, and follow his Highne&s;s's Orders, who led them on &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that they repul&s;ed the <HI>Switzers</HI> from that advantageous Po&s;t with great Lo&s;s, and thereby became Ma&s;ters of our Artille|ry, which otherwi&s;e had been lo&s;t. As to the gi|ving your Lord&s;hip a true and exact Account of the Battel in all Particulars, I find it impo&s;&s;ible to be done; the Relation in <HI>French</HI> which I &s;ent by the la&s;t Orders as to the manner of the En|gagement, is &s;aid to be the exacte&s;t we are like to &s;ee on this &s;ide.</P>
<P>On Sunday Night I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s by way of Di&s;cour&s;e to get the true&s;t and ample&s;t In|formation I could from Mon&s;ieur <HI>Gelder&s;maes</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Wa&s;&s;enaer</HI>, as well as from Sir <HI>Gabriel Syl|vius</HI>, of the pre&s;ent State and Condition of our Armies, both as to their Numbers, and Method taken in their Affairs, and of the Factions and Differences &s;o prevalent among&s;t them; and they all agreed in this, that there was &s;o ill a Cor|re&s;pondence betwixt his Highne&s;s, and indeed all the Generals, and his Excellency, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity for his Return. They told me farther, that <HI>Souches</HI> was not that great General he was e&s;teemed; that he was no Ob&s;erver of Martial Di&s;cipline, whereby his Army was like a Herd of wild Bea&s;ts; that he was old and doting, $nd wholly lo&s;t his Memory; that he pre&s;ently $orgets what Orders he hath either given or re|$eived from his Highne&s;s. That General <HI>Spark</HI> $word$ a mere Brute without common Civility, almo&s;t $umanity: That he may be a good Commander $word$ two or three thou&s;and Hor&s;e for a Flying $rmy; but that he has neither Temper nor Parts $ any degree proper for &s;o great a Charge; and
<PB N="114" REF="167">

<P>I Suppo&s;e I can now give a particular Account of the Cau&s;e of the ill Corre&s;pondency which hath happen'd from the beginning of this Campaign between his Highne&s;s, General <HI>Souches</HI>, and his Excellency; which being related to me in Confi|dence by a prime Mini&s;ter here, I think it my Duty to repre&s;ent to your Lord&s;hip, as I had it by way of Di&s;cour&s;e; the Source of which Diffe|rence began thus:</P>
<P>General <HI>Souches</HI>, at his Arrival with his Army upon the Borders of our Territories, made a great Demur upon pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI>, hovering from one Place to another, occa&s;ion'd principally by his In&s;tructions from the Emperor, that he &s;hould march to the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e Countries, acting what he thought convenient for the Advantage of the League, but not pa&s;s the <HI>Meuse</HI> without a pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ity, which was le&s;t to his own Di&s;cretion to judge of; howeve$ if the publick Exigency of Affairs required hi$ Pa&s;&s;age, he was from that time of his Pa&s;&s;ag$ to govern him&s;elf and Army according to the Or+ders he &s;hould receive from his Excellency. Th$ occa&s;ion'd General <HI>Souches</HI> to halt on the othe$ side of the River, and to keep him&s;elf there propo&s;ing to be&s;iege <HI>Mazieris</HI> and <HI>Charleville</HI> $word$ that &s;ide the River, whil&s;t his Highne&s;s and E$+cellency, with their Armies, &s;hould act on the $word$ &s;ide&punc; and this was one great Point of th$ $$$$rence at their Interview at <HI>Landen</HI>. But $word$ $$ne was marching that way, and had made a H$

with his Army to take in <HI>Dinant</HI>, News came from the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of the Defeat and Retreat of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s and <HI>Bournovile</HI>'s Troops, with Letters at the &s;ame time from the Elector to General <HI>Souches</HI>, to have part of his Troops &s;ent immediately for the Succour of his Coun|try, which the General refu&s;ed without expre&s;s Orders from the Emperor, which the Elector pre&s;&s;ed home at <HI>Vienna</HI>, affirming, that in ca&s;e part of tho&s;e Troops did not return for his Suc|cour, he &s;hould be inforced to make his Peace with <HI>France</HI>. On the other Hand, his Excellency by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, u&s;ed all imaginable Arts to hinder the dividing General <HI>Souches</HI>'s Ar|my, a&s;&s;uring his Imperial Maje&s;ty, and his Ele|ctoral Highne&s;s, that the <HI>Luxenburgh</HI> Troops, to the Number of nine thou&s;and Men, that were de&s;igned for the&s;e Low Countries, &s;hould march directly to the <HI>Palatinate</HI>, and would be there much &s;ooner than the imperial Troops from hence. In fine, General <HI>Souches</HI> receiv'd Orders from his Imperial Maje&s;ty to &s;end back part of his Troops under the Command of the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> for Succour of the <HI>Palatinate</HI>, which he did accor|dingly. Immediately whereupon his Excellency $arther pre&s;&s;ed General <HI>Souches</HI> to pa&s;s the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI>, &s;ince there could be no thought of his doing a|$y good upon <HI>Mazieris</HI> and <HI>Charleville</HI> with his $ingle Army, and withal that there was a Nece&s;|&s;ity of a &s;peedy Conjunction of their Armies. $ut General <HI>Souches</HI> &s;till held off upon his Re&s;o|$ution of not being commanded by his Excellency, $nd finding in his In&s;tructions that he was equal|$ obliged to obey his Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>O|$nge</HI>, he thereupon &s;ent his Son to his Highne&s;s's $uarters at <HI>Park</HI> near <HI>Louvain</HI>, to adju&s;t that
<PB N="118" REF="171">
Matter &s;o, as if it could be agreed that his Ex|cellency would promi&s;e not to come to the Ar|my, nor pretend to command it, but leave the &s;ole Di&s;po&s;ition of it to his Highne&s;s and Gene|ral <HI>Souches</HI>, that then he, the General, would be contented to pa&s;s the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI>, and according to his In&s;tructions obey the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>. Upon this there was an A&s;&s;urance given by his Excel|lency that he would not come to the Army, whereby his Highne&s;s and General <HI>Souches</HI> were fully &s;atisfyed, and a Probability of a very good Corre&s;pondence between them, and in order to it, General <HI>Souches</HI> re&s;olv'd and prepar'd to pa&s;s the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI>, and his Highne&s;s marched from <HI>Park</HI> to join his Army, which was no &s;ooner done, but unexpectedly comes his Excellency from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> to <HI>Janch</HI>, where the Armies were, which &s;o &s;ur|prized General <HI>Souches</HI>, that for &s;ome time he would not &s;ee him, making great Complaint of his coming to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>. Hereupon his Excellency &s;ent the Marque&s;s <HI>Burgomenie</HI> to General <HI>Souches</HI>, to let him know his coming was to ha&s;ten the advancing of their Armies, being now joined, having lo&s;t &s;o much time already; with this farther, That his Excellency had notice from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Vienna</HI>, that Ge|neral <HI>Souches</HI> had Orders to obey his Excellency. To this General <HI>Souches</HI> reply'd, That he would not have pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> but that his Excellency had promi&s;ed not to come to the Army, nor pre+tend to the Command of it; that for his part he had not &s;pent &s;o many Years in the War, an$ brought a veteran Army of that Strength int$ tho&s;e Countries, to receive Orders from two &s;uc$ young Generals as the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and h$ Excellency, who&s;e Orders were like to interfe$

every Day, and &s;o his Army be bandied from one Place to another; that it was not for a General of his Age and Experience to be thus u&s;ed, and that he would act no farther upon &s;uch Terms; but that for his Highne&s;s, he had his In&s;tructions to obey him as well as his Excellency, and that his Highne&s;s being in the Head of a more power|ful Army than the Emperor's, he was contented, and re&s;olved to obey his Highne&s;s &s;olely; and that for his Excellency, who had only brought three thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Dragoons in&s;tead of twenty five thou&s;and Men, he would have nothing to do with him in point of Command.</P>
<P>This Difference continued for &s;ome Days, which was increa&s;ed by &s;ome Di&s;putes of the &s;ame Na|ture between his Highne&s;s and Excellency, who finding his Highne&s;s and General <HI>Souches</HI> both a|greeing in the main Point, of outing his Ex|cellency from any Pretence of Command; his Ex|cellency thereupon declared that he would only continue with the Army in quality of a Volunteer 'till he &s;aw more of his Troops join'd with them, which he did accordingly, but in that un&s;oldier-like manner, that by his fea&s;ting and entertain|ing the <HI>German</HI> Ladies, he put the Army much out of Order, many of the principal Officers in Complai&s;ance being at his Balls, when they &s;hould have been at their Po&s;ts, being &s;o near an Enemy, to the &s;o great di&s;ta&s;te both of his Highne&s;s and Ge|neral <HI>Souches</HI>, that they re&s;olved to attempt no|thing whil&s;t he continued with them.</P>
<P>In this Interval happen'd the late Bittel, whil&s;t his Excellency was gone towards <HI>Mons</HI> with a ve|ry con&s;iderable part of his own Troops, merely for his Guard, when there was no Danger; which Troops and Dragoons, had they been pre&s;ent,

might have made a great Alteration in that Days Service; and notwith&s;tanding his Excellency was &s;o near all the time of the Battel, that he might have c$me in with all tho&s;e Troops much to our Advantage, and much &s;ooner than the <HI>Germans</HI>, yet he never did it, to our eternal Reproach in After Ages, when it &s;hall be &s;aid &s;o bloody a Bat|tel was fought in the Heart of our Territories, by our Confederates engaged for our Intere&s;t, whil&s;t the Governour of the Country, with a great part of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops, kept at a di&s;tance, and never came in to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, there being only &s;ome few Regiments of our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cavalry engaged, who de&s;erted their Officers and refu&s;ed to Cha$ge; di&s;couraged, we pre&s;ume, by the Ab|&s;ence of their other Troops.</P>
<P>The V$ader General, who was at that time with his Excellency, when he heard the fir&s;t &s;hooting, importun'd his Excellency to return to the Battel&punc; affirming it to be an eternal Infamy to any Per&s;on that had <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Blood in his Veins to &s;tand there di&s;cour&s;ing of the Battel, whil&s;t their Confederates were fighting for them, but Mon&s;ieur <HI>la M$tte</HI> was of another Opinion, to which his Excellency more willingly adhered.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o inform'd that the Duke <HI>de Villa Her|m$&s;a</HI> publickly declared &s;ince the Battel, that he is in Honour engaged to &s;erve this Campaign, but will never &s;erve an Hour longer in the Qua|lity he now is whil&s;t this Governour continues And I am told from no ordinary Hands, Tha$ all the&s;e Circum&s;tances, with many more too long f$r a Letter, are repre&s;ented with muc$ Sharpne&s;s, both to the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Ma+drid</HI>, &s;econded by all the Generals of the Counts excepting only the Prince <HI>de Va$demont</HI>.

all the&s;e things con&s;idered, I pre&s;ume your Lord|&s;hip will not much wonder at the ill Corre&s;pon|dence among&s;t us, and that there is but &s;mall Appearance of our doing any great Matters this Campaign. And your Lord&s;hip will ea&s;ily judge by the pre&s;ent State of things here, whether our Nece&s;&s;ities will not urge us to a Peace, &s;ince little Redre&s;s is like to be by the Sword; for though at the fir&s;t opening of the Campaign, by comparing our Forces with the Enemies, there was a &s;eem|ing Probability of doing great things, yet for ought I &s;ee hitherto the Remedy appears wor&s;e than $he Di&s;ea&s;e, and our Nece&s;&s;ities will be &s;oon redoubled upon us; for we do not only want Trea&s;ure to maintain the Charges of the War, but even Sub&s;i&s;tence for them that fight for us; &s;o that tho&s;e that a&s;&s;i&s;t us here, are growing &s;o weary of it, that I am afraid they will hardly be drawn to continue it much longer.</P>
<P>We are in great Expectation of our next Let|ters from <HI>Spain</HI>, it being the general Opinion a|mong&s;t the wi&s;e&s;t &s;ort here, that we &s;hall &s;ud|denly &s;ee great Alterations in our Government, there having never been &s;o univer&s;al a Di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction among&s;t all our Officers Military and Civil, as well as among&s;t the People, many crying out, There can be no le&s;s than Trea&s;on in the ill Ma|nagement of our Affairs; whil&s;t the more Mode|rate bewail the Mi&s;eries of our Country, occa|&s;ion'd (as they &s;ay) by the Weakne&s;s and Incapa|cities of tho&s;e that are at the Helm.

<P>OUR Armies &s;till continue in the &s;ame Po&s;t they were, with this only Difference, That the Imperiali&s;ts are said to be fortifying their Cam$, and particularly at the Abbey of <HI>Cre&s;pin</HI>, where they intend to continue to watch the Mo|tion of the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>, whil&s;t the Prince of <HI>Oran$$</HI> with his Army &s;hall be&s;iege <HI>Journey</HI>, and his Excellency, as $is &s;aid, with our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops, &s;hall at the &s;ame time be&s;iege <HI>O$d$nard</HI>. The&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="176">
are our general Di&s;cour&s;es here, grounded upon the great Preparation his Excellency is making to draw his Troops together from all Parts, there being in the &s;everal Provinces at lea&s;t fifteen thou|&s;and Pea&s;ants &s;ummon'd in with their Arms, the greate&s;t part of which are to be made u&s;e of as Pioneers. The mo&s;t of our Forces are drawn from <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>St. Omer</HI>, and are gone for <HI>Ypre</HI>, whil&s;t the Country Militia is drawn into tho&s;e two Pla|ces for their pre&s;ent Security, there being no E|nemy like to attempt them.</P>
<P>On Saturday la&s;t all the Pea&s;ants from about <HI>Louvain, Tirtlemont, Die&s;t</HI>, and tho&s;e Parts, with their Proportions of Waggons, came in hither, and are marched from hence towards <HI>Gaunt</HI>, all their Waggons being filled with Ammunition, Spades, Pick Axes, and all other Materials for a Siege.

A Famine in all Appearance being like to &s;ucceed this War, as well as Sickne&s;s, which has begun already in many of our Garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday &s;even Companies of the Prince <HI>de B$de</HI>'s Regiment of <HI>Germans</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Louvain</HI>, and marched from thence to <HI>Malines</HI>, where they are to be tran&s;ported with a <HI>Dutch</HI> Regiment towards <HI>G$$m</HI>; his Excellency u&s;ing all Diligence to get fifteen or &s;ixteen thou&s;and Men together out of hi$ Garri&s;ons, be&s;ides his Troops already in <HI>Hat|na$$$</HI>, that he may no longer lie under the Cen|&s;ure of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and General <HI>Souches</HI>, $word$ not having his alotted Number of Men accor|ding
<PB N="124" REF="177">
to his Agreement, the want of which they &s;eem much to regret.</P>
<P>We hear the Imperiali&s;ts have made great In|cur&s;ions into <HI>France</HI>, committing all the barbarous Cruelties that could be expected from the wor&s;t of Enemies, not only burning all Places they could ma&s;ter, but killing all Per&s;ons they could find, without Exception of Age or Sex. That this la&s;t Week they went as far as St. <HI>Quintin</HI>, near which Place they took a Ca&s;tle, after &s;ome Re&s;i&s;tance, where &s;ome Per&s;ons of Quality were retired for their Security, whom they killed, vio|lating all the Women, and then &s;et Fire to it, and burnt it to the Ground. That for ten Leagues together there is neither Man, Woman, or Child to be &s;een in tho&s;e Parts. The&s;e and many o|ther the like &s;ad Relations we have from the Camp, there being nothing el&s;e done but ruining the whole Country; and becau&s;e we yet think we have not enough to do it effectually, we are told that fifteen thou&s;and more <HI>Germans</HI> are co|ming towards us, who perhaps may come time e|nough to make this poor Country their Winter Quarters, which will this Year be entirely ruin'd.</P>
<P>To behold our Nobility and Gentry here is now really a &s;ad Spectacle, they being become heartle&s;s, &s;eeing no Appearance of any thing but De&s;olation to their Country, and that by tho&s;e from whom they expected Relief. And as to our talking of Sieges, it's look'd upon by many as a Romance, &s;ince either we do not really in|tend it, or el&s;e defer it too long; and truly, I am in$lined to believe we &s;hall do little or nothing this Campaign, the be&s;t Officers the Prince of <HI>O|range</HI> has being &s;till u&s;ele&s;s by their Wounds.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="178">I am certainly inform'd that the Imperial Ar|my is not at this pre&s;ent above fifteen thou&s;and Combatants, and yet they will have the Continu|ance of &s;ixty thou&s;and Rations of Bread each Day, of which there is already &s;o great want in the Camp, that though they are in the be&s;t Pro|vince of the Country yet they mu&s;t be &s;upply'd by a Convoy from hence; by which it may ea|&s;ily be judged in what Condition we are to be|gin a Campaign in an Enemies Country, when our Armies cannot find Sub&s;i&s;tence in that plenti|ful Country by our own Garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>There is certainly &s;ome evil Angel &s;upervi&s;es our Affairs here, or el&s;e it were impo&s;&s;ible things &s;hould be &s;o &s;trangely managed; and with all this, his Excellency &s;eems no more concern'd, than if this Country were in the greate&s;t Pro|&s;perity; and nothing is buzz'd into our Ears by the Court-Flies but the pre&s;ent be&s;ieging two Pla|ces at once, one being too little for their victo|rious Armies; but if we make no quicker Progre&s;s with the&s;e Sieges than our Confederates do with their Siege of <HI>Grave</HI>, I am afraid we &s;hall then make but a &s;ad end of this Campaign. From which Camp I am told, by Letters of the 1^&s;^t in&s;tant, that their Attacks go on as &s;lowly as ever, and the <HI>Holland</HI> Re&s;ident &s;aid Ye&s;terday, That 'till they had five thou&s;and more Foot, there was little Expectation of doing much good upon it.</P>
<P>We hear from <HI>Charleroy</HI>, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mon|talt</HI> is pa&s;t all Danger, and &s;o well recovered as to walk in his Chamber; his Troops rove much about the Country, and take great Boo|$y. On Saturday la&s;t a Party from thence took
<PB N="126" REF="179">
all the Baggage of Marque&s;s <HI>Conflans</HI>, going from thence after him to <HI>Namur</HI>, where he com|mands at pre&s;ent, the Governor of that Place be|ing &s;o indi&s;po&s;ed that he is unable to take Care of it.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> with his Army is in|camped on the other &s;ide the <HI>Sambre</HI> near <HI>Maubeux</HI>, waiting the Motions of our Armies. Some &s;ay he is reinforced with fre&s;h Troops; but we will as little believe that, as that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty is like to do any great Matters with his Arrierban, who, we &s;ay, will not pa&s;s out of their own Territories. So that we and our Allies &s;hall have the Plea&s;ure to de&s;troy our own Country without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of our Enemies.</P>
<P>And if we can take two or three Places before the end of this Campaign, we &s;hall then a&s;&s;ured|ly have the Sub&s;tance of the late Victory, though the <HI>French</HI> have it, as yet, in Appearance.</P>

<P>ON Tue&s;day Night Lieutenant General <HI>Agour|to</HI> came hither from the Camp with Two thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Five hundred Dragoons, who were that Night encamped without the <HI>F$anders</HI> Port; three Hor&s;e were commanded
<PB N="129" REF="182">
out of each Troop, <HI>Spaniards, Germans</HI> and <HI>Dutch. Agourto</HI> was all that Night with his Excellency and Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Motte</HI>, till Five in the Morning that he was &s;ent to his Troops to march with them to <HI>A&s;ch</HI> in the way to <HI>Alo&s;t</HI>, where he had Orders to &s;tay till Midnight to refre&s;h his Men, and then to pur&s;ue his March according to his In&s;tructions. That Evening about Six came an Expre&s;s from the Camp to adverti&s;e his Excel|lency, that the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops had pa&s;s'd the River at <HI>Pont al Hayn</HI> the Day before, and that the Prince and General <HI>Souches</HI> had that Morning decamped, and jointly pa&s;s'd the River upon Bridges laid over for that purpo&s;e, having alter'd it &s;eems their former Re|&s;olutions of dividing their Armies. Hereupon his Excellency forthwith di&s;patched Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Motte</HI> after Lieutenant General <HI>Agourto</HI> to ha&s;ten his March, and that from thence he &s;hould go to <HI>Dermond</HI> and <HI>Gaunt</HI> to ha&s;ten tho&s;e Regiments, and to &s;ee the Boors put in order, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;|&s;els, with the great Guns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be drawn up towards <HI>Gaunt</HI>.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the Armies are marched betwixt <HI>Aeth</HI> $nd <HI>Tournay</HI> directly in the way towards <HI>Oude|$ard</HI>; but their Armies being all united, and &s;o $reat Forces going from all Garri&s;ons in the&s;e Parts, makes many believe their De&s;ign is more $on&s;iderable than the attacking <HI>Oudenard</HI> and <HI>Cour|$$ay:</HI> Various Conjectures are made according to Men's Fancies; and it's whi&s;per'd among&s;t &s;ome $s if they intended to march directly towards <HI>$unkirk</HI>, where they are lea&s;t expected, and the <HI>$rench</HI> wor&s;t provided; but this is only Surmi&s;e, $$d your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t be content to be in the $ark as to the Certainty of their De&s;igns till the

The Regiment of <HI>Sp$no&s;a</HI> was about Nine hundred, <HI>Montalto</HI> Six hundred, and <HI>Belvidere</HI> Five hundred. The Boors were drawn up in &s;ix Battallions, and were inten|ded for Five hundred in each Battallion, but wan|ted of that number. There was Four hundred Waggons upon the King's Account, be&s;ides tho&s;e that march'd with the Regiments, and belong'd to the Officers, and two great Mortars, but no Cannon; great &s;tore of Granades, and all Mate|rials for a Siege; they march'd directly towards <HI>Alo&s;t</HI>, and I believe will this Night encamp about $word$. The Marquis <HI>d' O&s;&s;era</HI> march'd with them and c$mmands all in chief: I am told that th$ Regiment of <HI>Aldade</HI>, the Duke <HI>d' Avery, Copeny Duffey</HI> and a <HI>German</HI> Regiment, with about Fou$ thou&s;and Boors are to meet them to morrow a$ <HI>Alo&s;t</HI>, and the next Day &s;ome more from <HI>Gaunt</HI> There was not one Troop of Hor&s;e that march with them this Day.</P>
<P>By Letters from <HI>Valenchiennes</HI> of the 12^t^h i$+&s;tant I am told, that before the Armies decamp$$ from hence the Regiment of <HI>Boumont</HI> con&s;i&s;ti$$ of T$e$$e hundred effective Men was &s;ent $ <HI>Ca$$$$</HI> upon the Arrival of which &s;ix Com$ m$ of the Regiment of <HI>Molambeck</HI> were $ f$$m thence to <HI>Boucham</HI>, and that &s;ix Compa$ of $he Count de <HI>Sore</HI>'s Regiment were &s;ent $word$

And to prevent their Sub&s;i&s;tence in the <HI>French</HI> Conque&s;ts, &s;trict Orders have been &s;ome time &s;ince &s;ent from the <HI>French</HI> Garri&s;ons to all the Towns and Villa|ges round, to &s;end in all their Provi&s;ions of Corn $nd Forrage into the next adjacent <HI>French</HI> Garri|&s;ons, re&s;erving only for their pre&s;ent Sub&s;i&s;tence; upon Penalty of having all that remains burnt; $word$ pro&s;ecution of which the Marquis <HI>d' Ancre</HI> Governour of <HI>Aeth</HI> has cau&s;ed the Towns of <HI>Le&s;|$$s</HI> and <HI>Chieure</HI>, with the rich Abby of <HI>Chambre</HI>, $word$ burnt to the Ground, becau&s;e the Boors had

carried in great Stores of Corn thither, and not into his Garri&s;on according to his Orders.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tournay</HI> they are very apprehen&s;ive of a Siege, and have therefore publi&s;hed &s;trict Orders, requi|ring all Burghers upon Pain of Death not to &s;tir out of their Hou&s;es in ca&s;e of a Siege; and that their Wives and Maid-Servants &s;hall have liberty each Day to go out for two Hours to buy Provi|&s;ions and Nece&s;&s;aries for their Families, but not to be out any longer.</P>
<P>At <HI>Courtray</HI>, it's &s;aid, the Governour and In|tendant have proffer'd to quit that Town, if the Burghers would give &s;uch a con&s;iderable Sum as they demanded, but that the Magi&s;trates ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to make any &s;uch Agreement.

<P>WE are informed by my Lord <HI>Ca&s;tlehaven</HI>, who came from the Camp before <HI>Grave</HI> on Wedne&s;day la&s;t, that the Be&s;iegers were then lodged at the Foot of the Glacis of the Counter|&s;carp: That General <HI>Rabenhaut</HI> having but a &s;mall Army of Twelve thou&s;and Men, thinks not fit to attack the Place by Force, to the hazard of his Army, the Place being very &s;mall, and many Men to defend it; and therefore he goes the &s;urer though the longer way, and has now &s;o clo&s;ed it up, and has &s;o &s;trong a Line of Contravallation, that it is impo&s;&s;ible either for Relief to enter, or the Be&s;ieged to &s;ally.</P>
<P>That there are many Batteries again&s;t it, which play ince&s;&s;antly; and the Be&s;ieged have &s;tore or Cannon and Powder, are not backward in retur|$ing the Salutes of their Enemies, there being $ore great Guns di&s;charged daily than hath been
<PB N="134" REF="187">
known in any Siege for the&s;e many Years. That the <HI>French</HI> are all lodged in their Works, but that the wet Weather will quickly force them in|to the Town, and more prejudice them than the <HI>Dutch</HI> who are lodged upon drier Ground, and have abundance of all Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip &s;ays, there has been a great Over|&s;ight committed by the <HI>French</HI>, in not breaking down the great Dyke that was betwixt the Town and River, whereby the Be&s;iegers could have made no Lodgment there without much Lo&s;s, who are now lodged there in much Security.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>W$l$iam Ballandine</HI> having lately brought over &s;ix Companies of Foot from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Bol|duc</HI>, went on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> la&s;t to pay his Re&s;pects to General <HI>Rab$nhaut</HI>, and after that would in Cu|rio&s;ity go down to the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI>-&s;ide to &s;ee the Approaches and the Fort which the <HI>French</HI> had blown up and quitted, which he enter'd; and in his Return back he was kill'd with a Canon &s;hot, which hit him in the back, took away the greate&s;t Part of his Body&punc; leaving his Head and Arms hanging by a little Skin; his Heart was &s;ound intire &s;ome Paces from the Place; there was a Lieutenant al&s;o ki&s;&s;'d with him; the remaining Part of his Body was taken up and convey'd to <HI>B$lduc</HI>, and there interred.</P>
<P>This Afternoon another Gentleman is come from <HI>Gr$$e</HI>, who le&s;t it on <HI>Friday</HI> la&s;t, and &s;ays, $word$ the States had &s;ent po&s;itive Orders to Gene|ral <HI>R$b$nhaut</HI> to make as quick a Di&s;patch of that Work as was po&s;&s;ible; and that he &s;hould pro$eed with his Attacks more vigorou&s;ly that he had done hitherto; and that the General was re&s;olv'd to proceed accordingly, hoping to be Ma&s;ter of it in ten Days. But my Lord <HI>Ca&s;tle+haven</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="188">
&s;ays, no Judgment can be made when the Town will be taken, it depending upon their Wants within, not the Force without; and that when he left it, the General him&s;elf thought he did a great Work, if he became Ma&s;ter of it in a Month's time; hoping by that time &s;ome one nece&s;&s;ary thing would be wanting, which would enforce them to a Surrender.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>, with the three Confede|rate Armies, hath be&s;ieged <HI>Oudenard</HI>, and on Sun|day opened their Trenches: The Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI>, with the <HI>Spaniards</HI>, is po&s;ted at the Abby of <HI>Enam</HI>, on that Side towards <HI>Gaunt</HI>; and 'tis &s;aid that <HI>Aldado</HI>, with the <HI>Spaniards</HI>, hath at|tacked and taken a Redoubt: That the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army are po&s;ted on that &s;ide towards <HI>Courtray</HI> and <HI>Lille</HI>, and the <HI>Germans</HI> towards <HI>Aeth</HI> and <HI>Tournay</HI>, being encamped along the River from <HI>Potts</HI> to <HI>Oudenard</HI>. We are told, that it was re&s;olv'd &s;o &s;oon as this Siege was form'd the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;hould with his Army be&s;iege <HI>Courtray</HI>, the reducing of both which Places are e&s;teem'd here to be only a Work of eight Days, and after that they would fall upon &s;ome more con&s;idera|ble Siege: But the moving of the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> has alter'd tho&s;e Re&s;olutions, and will cau&s;e their Armies to draw clo&s;er together, le&s;t the Prince &s;hould take them again at the &s;ame Advantage. He pa&s;s'd the <HI>Sambre</HI> with his Army the 14^t^h, and (as our Letters from <HI>Mons</HI> &s;ay) marched to <HI>Que&s;noy</HI>, and from thence bended his March be|twixt <HI>Bouchain</HI> and <HI>Valenciennes</HI>, pa&s;&s;ing the River at the Village of <HI>Denning</HI>, a League from <HI>Bou|chain</HI>; that from thence he marched towards <HI>Do$$y</HI>, and pa&s;s'd that River at <HI>Pout de Ra&s;h</HI>&punc; We will not believe here that he is above Twenty
<PB N="136" REF="189">
five thou&s;and Men, and tho&s;e in very ill Condi|tion; and that the Confederates will be able to keep their Siege, and fight him, their Armies being near Fifty thou&s;and effective, be&s;ides the armed Pea&s;ants, and &s;ome Regiments of his Ex|cellency's Infantry, who are &s;ent to <HI>Ypre, Ayre</HI>, and St. <HI>Omer</HI>&punc; to reinforce tho&s;e Garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>Ther$ $word$ an Expre&s;s come this Afternoon from Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Motte</HI> to his Excellency, who left <HI>Gaunt</HI> at Ten this Morning: What News he has brought is kept very private, which makes us judge 'tis not very good. 'Tis &s;aid the <HI>French</HI> did Ye&s;terday make a Sally, wherein they lo&s;t eighty Men, but no Lo&s;s named on our &s;ide. The Guns have play'd all Ye&s;terday and this Day; but the great Guns from <HI>Gaunt</HI> were not arrived at the Camp&punc; but will be there this Night. We are told the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> is advancing apace towards the Confederates; and 'tis &s;aid, that this Night he will be encamped with his Army at <HI>Leure</HI>, betwixt <HI>Aeth</HI> and <HI>Tournay</HI> within five Leagues of <HI>Oudenard</HI>; but we expect a Confirmation of that by this Night's Po&s;t, before we give Credit to it; and if that prove true, his Army mu&s;t be much &s;tronger than we report it. We were in great Apprehen&s;ions of his taking a Turn this way&punc; and have therefore kept two <HI>German</HI> Regiment: here, with one <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>; and the new rais'd Regi+ment of the Prince <HI>de Croye</HI> is at <HI>Malines</HI>, for Se+curity of that Place; his Excellency was likewi&s;$ prepar'd to go to <HI>Antwerp</HI> after his Lady, but no$ &s;he is return'd hither.</P>
<P>I am told from a good Hand, that his Exce+llency &s;ays, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and Genera$ <HI>Souches</HI> do now as eagerly court him to come $word$ the Army, as they did before de&s;ire his Depa$+ture
<PB N="137" REF="190">
That for his part, he will go no more to the Camp; that all his Employment is to be their Providore; that he has now &s;ent them Bread and Meat for twenty Days for all their Armies; and that having furni&s;hed them with what they de&s;i|red both as to Men, Ammunition and Provi&s;ions, it &s;hall be no more his Fault but theirs, if they proceed not vigorou&s;ly, and make a great Ad|vance into <HI>France</HI>, &s;ince he knows the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> with all his Supplies will not be able to make Head again&s;t them. I am al&s;o told in con|fidence from the &s;ame Per&s;on, that his Excellency talks much of his returning to <HI>Spain</HI>, and that he intends pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>England</HI>, and making a &s;hort &s;tay there; and 'tis whi&s;per'd that the&s;e la&s;t Letters from <HI>Spain</HI> have brought &s;ome Inti|mation that he is like to be recalled.</P>
<P>The Queen Regent's Plea&s;ure is not yet decla|red as to a Ma&s;ter de Camp General; Marquis <HI>Burgomeny</HI> is much &s;poken of, and &s;ome &s;ay the Marquis <HI>d' O&s;&s;era</HI> General of the Artillery.</P>

<P>IN pur&s;uance of my Duty and your Commands, I am to give your Honour a particular Ac|count concerning the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Merchant's Ships at <HI>O&s;tend</HI>. On Saturday Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chri&s;tine</HI>, whom his Excellency &s;ent thither as Commi&s;&s;ary to examine that Matter return'd, and on Sunday in the Evening gave his Excellency an Account. The Con&s;ul came with him, accompanied with two or three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants in behalf of the re&s;t. Ye&s;terday I gave a Vi&s;it to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chri|&s;tine</HI> to know from him how that Affair &s;tood, which I judged nece&s;&s;ary for the expediting of it, at lea&s;t that I might have &s;o much light from him, as might in able me to give your Honour a true State of that Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="192">The Commi&s;&s;ary told me he had examin'd the Matter, and taken full Information of it, but would not undertake of him&s;elf to judge it, there being &s;o great Conte&s;ts on both &s;ides, tho&s;e of <HI>O&s;tend</HI> pretending as much Right to detain the Ships, as the Merchants to have them releas'd. That he had given his Excellency a faithful Re|lation of the whole, which his Excellency had again referred to the Council of State to adju&s;t, and give their Opinions therein, and de&s;ir'd I would have Patience for &s;ome few Days, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s would be ended to his Maje&s;ty's Satisfa|ction. I told him, that Delays herein would be the Ruin of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects that were con|cern'd; and that if there were not a timely Sa|tisfaction given, his Maje&s;ty would be nece&s;&s;ita|ted to take other Mea&s;ures, and give his Subjects leave to right them&s;elves; to which he reply'd, that I might re&s;t confident there would be no &s;uch Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I then demanded what he had done concerning <HI>Bartelet</HI> and <HI>John&s;on</HI>, tho&s;e two in&s;olent Privateers, who had committed that unheard of Outrage upon his Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Wolwich</HI> Sloop; to which he told me, the fir&s;t of them was Pri&s;oner in <HI>Eng|land</HI>, where his Maje&s;ty might do Ju&s;tice upon him, and the other was Pri&s;oner in <HI>France</HI>, which was all the An&s;wer I had from him; and Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> confirms to me, that they are both taken, and that he has given your Honour an Account of it.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday at Court the Burgoma&s;ter and Bai|li&s;t of <HI>O&s;tend</HI>, with two more of their Magi&s;trates came to me, and told me, they were impower'd from the Capers to hinder relea&s;ing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants Ships. We had a warm Di&s;cour&s;e to|gether, wherein they seem'd much incensed that
<PB N="140" REF="193">
his Excellency had di&s;charged the <HI>Flying Hare</HI> without their being heard, and &s;aid there was one thou&s;and five hundred Seamen in <HI>O&s;tend</HI> ready to ri&s;e in Arms upon it, and to fall upon the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>, but that they prevented them; that howe|ver, one of them with a Knife had violently a&s;&s;aul|ted one of that Ship, and had &s;orely wounded him in the Face, which they could not prevent. They told me farther, that in ca&s;e his Excellency di&s;charged the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els without their being heard, they would appeal to the Queen Regent; and enlarged very much what Certifica|tions they had brought up to prove the&s;e Ships were lawful Prize, with many things of that kind. And I do find that they are highly recommended and &s;econded by the Governors of <HI>O&s;tend</HI> and <HI>Newport</HI>, who go Shares with them; and by this means have made many of the Great Ones here their Friends. And I under&s;tand from <HI>Antwerp</HI>, that they have Bills of Exchange there for twen|ty thou&s;and Guilders, to be di&s;po&s;ed in Bribes, for making friends in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, which makes me doubt we &s;hall find Delays, unle&s;s his Excel|lency be farther quickened by Letters.</P>
<P>The Re&s;ident of <HI>Holland</HI> had this Day much Di&s;cour&s;e with me concerning them, and &s;hew'd me Copies of &s;everal &s;harp Letters written by the States to his Excellency upon the Detention of &s;everal of their Ships, and a&s;&s;ures me that he has Orders from his Maje&s;ty to tell his Excellency, That if a timely Remedy be not put to their In|&s;olencies, they &s;hall not only be nece&s;&s;itated to grant L$$ $word$ of Reprizal, but to &s;end four or five Men o$ War to block them up.

<P>HAving receiv'd Notice from my Brother, of your Honour's Voyage to <HI>Holland</HI>, and of your Commands that I &s;hould &s;end your Lord&s;hip con&s;tant Adverti&s;ement of all Occurrences here; in Complyance of which, and of my Duty to your Honour, I pre&s;ume to give this Trouble.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent little can be expected from hence, the Pro&s;pect of this Theatre being much changed &s;ince the Armies removal from the&s;e Provinces. That which gives the mo&s;t Occa&s;ion of Di&s;cour&s;e here, is your Lord&s;hip's Journey into <HI>Holland</HI>, which his Excellency &s;ays he knows to be in or|der to a Peace and Marriage, but he is well a&s;&s;u|red their League is &s;o firm and &s;teady, that he pre&s;umes all Endeavours of that kind will be fruit|le&s;s 'till after the next Campaign, and that he believes his Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> will not be induced to think of a Marriage 'till an honourable and la&s;ting Peace be made, which cannot be rea&s;onably expected in the broken Con|dition their Affairs here now &s;tand. However, the Grandees here are of Opinion they &s;hall have a Peace, &s;ince they &s;ee the States inclined to it; and indeed, the Poverty which this Country is reduc'd to, join'd with the Experience of the ill Management of the War, has much mollified the Affections of the mo&s;t warlike among them; &s;o that there is great Hope this high and Chri&s;tian Work of his Mediation may in due time have $ good I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="196">General <HI>Spork</HI> is &s;till be&s;ieging <HI>Dinant</HI>, from whence we are every Hour in Expectation to hear of its &s;urrender. The Burgoma&s;ter, with many of the principal Citizens, have &s;av'd them&s;elves and are retired, &s;ome to <HI>Namur</HI> where they are impri&s;oned, &s;ome to <HI>Liege</HI>, and others to <HI>Philip|ville</HI>. It is &s;aid here, that four hundred <HI>French</HI> are in the Ca&s;tle, and that there is Plenty of both Provi&s;ion and Ammunition, but that it is not for|tifyed, depending only upon its Situation, which towards the Town is very &s;trong, but on the Land &s;ide not. The Cannons &s;hot very hard Monday and Tue&s;day, but not having been heard &s;ince Ye&s;terday, many conclude it taken, and if &s;o, it's &s;aid they intend in the next Place to reduce the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Bouillon</HI>, and from thence, if they &s;ucceed, it's thought they will march towards <HI>Liege</HI> taking Advantage of their Commotion; and when they have taken the&s;e three Places, it will be near time to go to their Winter-Quarters, without advancing towards <HI>Triers</HI> as they &s;ay they will before they end their Campaign.</P>
<P>We hear that a Party &s;ent out from the Gar|ri&s;ons of <HI>Ayre</HI> and <HI>St. Omer</HI> into <HI>Boulongnois</HI>, to rai&s;e Contribution, rencountred with four hun|dred <HI>French</HI> belonging to <HI>Ardres</HI>, which the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Troops defeated, and brought in two hun|dred Pri&s;oners to <HI>St. Omer:</HI> This was warmly re|ported here this Day at Court, but I think it needs a farther Confirmation.</P>
<P>The States of <HI>Flanders</HI> have not yet come to a Conclu&s;ion in Point of their Sub&s;idies, two of the four Members are come hither to repre&s;ent to his Excellency the Difficulties they find in it, and to take &s;ome farther Directions from his Excellency for adju&s;ting that Matter; and 'till
<PB N="144" REF="197">
that be fini&s;hed, his Excellency will not go to <HI>Antwerp</HI>, nor pre&s;s the States of this Province, 'till he &s;ees a good I&s;&s;ue of that in <HI>Flanders</HI>.</P>
<P>Upon Sunday Morning Count <HI>d'Ur&s;el</HI>, by his Excellency's Appointment, parted hence for <HI>Ma|drid</HI>, attended with a hand&s;om Train, and with twenty of his Excellency's Guards for a Convoy as far as <HI>Cambray</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Don Pedro Ronquillos</HI> is &s;uddenly expected here, having receiv'd Orders to ha&s;ten his Journey, and be di&s;patched for <HI>England</HI> by his Excellency in a few Days after his Arrival here.</P>
<P>We are every Moment in Expectation of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Orders, by whom we &s;hall know the Cer|tainty either of his Excellency's Stay or Depar|ture; many are of Opinion that he will &s;udden|ly leave this Government, which he has much &s;o|licited, in hopes of being made one of the Great Council at <HI>Madrid</HI>. The Name of our new Ma|&s;ter de Camp General is al&s;o expected in the&s;e Letters, and who &s;hall be Governor of the Pro|vince of <HI>Namur</HI>, the Prince of <HI>Barban&s;on</HI> not be|ing owned by his Excellency 'till he has receiv'd a new Confirmation from <HI>Spain</HI>.</P>
<P>This is all which is &s;tirring as to the publick Affairs here, except the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Ships at <HI>O&s;tend</HI>, which I likewi&s;e think my Duty to give your Lord&s;hip an Account of in this following Relation.</P>
<P>By a Letter of the 2^d In&s;tant, <HI>S. V.</HI> from Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI>, I receiv'd Commands to in|form my &s;elf of his Excellency and chief Mini|&s;ters here, whether they made any Scruple of owning the Treaty of 67 at <HI>Madrid</HI>, which Com|mand was occa&s;ion'd by an Adverti&s;ement I gave his Honour of what I heard the Audientiary &s;ay
<PB N="145" REF="198">
concerning it, That it was a Peace never pub|li&s;hed.</P>
<P>According to Mr. Secretary's Commands, on Sunday la&s;t, I addre&s;s'd my &s;elf to his Excellen|cy, and took Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> the Con&s;ul with me to hear his Excellency's An&s;wer. I told his Excel|lency, that under&s;tanding the Papers and Proce&s;s concerning the detaining our Ships being now come from <HI>O&s;tend</HI> hither, we had &s;ome Hopes of having an I&s;&s;ue of that Bu&s;ine&s;s which had been &s;o long delayed, to the great Damage of His Ma|je&s;ty's Subjects, and con&s;equently to his Maje&s;ty's no &s;mall Di&s;plea&s;ure; that it was now &s;ea&s;ona|ble to have a Rule &s;et by which all Parties were to govern them&s;elves in this Affair, and that ac|cordingly I had receiv'd Orders in His Maje&s;ty's Name to &s;tick clo&s;e to the Treaty of 67, which was to be the Rule in the Deci&s;ion of this Bu&s;i|ne&s;s. And that therefore I thought it nece&s;&s;ary (for the gaining of Time, and preventing all Di&s;|putes that might otherwi&s;e ari&s;e,) to de&s;ire his Excellency to &s;end an Order to the High Court of Admiralty here, (who were to be Judges in this Bu&s;ine&s;s) to make that Treaty the Rule in the judging of the&s;e Ships, and that &s;uch Order from his Excellency might be regi&s;tred, of which I might have an Authentick Copy to &s;end to Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI>, for His Maje&s;ty's Satisfa|ction, and for Di&s;charge of my Duty. To this his Excellency an&s;wered, That the Papers were now $$me which he would tran&s;mit to the Admiralty, That he was very &s;orry the Bu&s;ine&s;s had been &s;o long delayed, That he mo&s;t confe&s;s tho&s;e of <HI>O|&s;tend</HI> were the greate&s;t Knaves in the World&punc; and that he did verily believe, when he &s;hould have this Government, if they could catch him at Sea,
<PB N="146" REF="199">
they would throw him over-board: And many more &s;harp Expre&s;&s;ions he made again&s;t them. But, in fine, when he came to the Point of the Treaty, he told us, It was a Treaty they had ne|ver &s;een or heard of, neither was it ever &s;ent hi|ther by the Queen, or any Orders about it; and that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that Letters &s;hould be forthwith written to our Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Ma|drid</HI>, to procure the Queen's Order hither for their owning that Treaty, and governing them&s;elves in all things accordingly, and &s;aid that he had al|ready written to that purpo&s;e; that in the mean time the Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould go on, which was all he could do to put them in a way of Ju&s;tice, and that if any <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships were taken in <HI>England</HI> they mu&s;t be relea&s;ed by the ordinary Form of Ju&s;tice. To this I reply'd, That I pre&s;um'd his Excellency was mi&s;inform'd in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, for that it would evidently appear that tho&s;e of <HI>O&s;tend</HI> had taken notice of that Treaty of 67; for that mo&s;t of the Ships that had been taken (as I was inform'd by the Con&s;ul there pre&s;ent) were taken by vertue of the fourteenth Article of that Trea|ty, for want of Pa&s;&s;eports as that Article direct|ed; and if they made u&s;e of one Article for our Di&s;advantage, we had rea&s;on to expect Liberty to make u&s;e of the other Articles in our Favour; that if the Treaty was not &s;ent hither, nor pub|li&s;hed, it was the Fault of the Mini&s;ters at <HI>Ma+drid</HI>, and could make nothing to the Prejudic$ of the Treaty which was ratifyed, nor to th$ Prejudice of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects who had tra+ded to <HI>France</HI> under Security of that Treaty, an that therefore I was commanded to &s;tick to the Treaty, and mu&s;t pretend again&s;t all Proceeding in this Bu&s;ine&s;s that were contrary to it. Her
<PB N="147" REF="200">
upon his Excellency told me, I had be&s;t to &s;peak with tho&s;e Mini&s;ters that were the proper Jud|ges of this Matter, whereupon I went with Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> the &s;ame Day to the Pre&s;ident of the Coun|cil, who was directly of the &s;ame Opinion as his Excellency, but &s;aid, he had not the proper Cognizance of it. But the Pre&s;ident of the High Court of Admiralty, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Blondel</HI>, with whom we likewi&s;e di&s;cour&s;ed the Matter, and de&s;ired to know by what Method he would pro|ceed, and whether he would not make the Treaty of 67 the Rule? which he &s;eem'd altogether in|clin'd to, and &s;aid he knew of no other way to determine the Matter, and &s;o &s;oon as the Papers came to his Hands he would &s;end them to two Coun&s;ellors to report, and when the Matter was ready we &s;hould have notice.</P>
<P>On Monday his Excellency &s;ent the Papers to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Blondel</HI>, and he has cho&s;en out four of the Proce&s;s, and has given them to two Coun&s;el|lors to report; and upon their Report we &s;hall know what farther Mea&s;ures to take, and if I find they will not admit of the Treaty, I &s;hall immediately di&s;patch an Expre&s;s to Mr. Secreta|ry to give him an Account of it, it being a Bu&s;ine&s;s of great Con&s;equence, and that timely notice be given of it.</P>
<P>I knew not what Judgment to make of this as yet, but I am much afraid we &s;hall meet with many Difficulties, the Capers having made great Intere&s;t by their Bribes, which they give out $word$ $$e Monies of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, and are very free of other Mens Pur&s;es. I &s;ee them $aily plying here &s;everal of the great Men and Favourites, and know they will leave no Stone $nmov'd to carry away what they have gotten.
<PB N="148" REF="201">
And I am a&s;&s;ur'd by &s;ome of the Merchants here who are concern'd, that the Value of the &s;everal Ships and Lading, which they have now taken at <HI>O&s;tend</HI>, amount to &s;ixteen hundred thou|&s;and Guilders, and that they have &s;old the La|ding of mo&s;t of the Ships, and that the Charges the Merchants have been daily at, &s;ince their &s;topping at <HI>O&s;tend</HI>, comes to at lea&s;t fifteen hun|dred Guilders <HI>per Diem</HI>.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ordinary which came on Thur&s;|day Night brought nothing as to his Ex|cellency's &s;udden leaving this Government, <HI>Don Juan</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> being not yet re&s;olv'd as to his coming. In the mean time, no Ma&s;ter de Camp General is named, as was expected, but it's &s;aid that if <HI>Don Juan</HI> come, the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo|&s;a</HI> &s;hall have a Complement made him to be Go|vernour of Arms, the better to induce his Stay, who has demanded his Conge of the Queen, but it is not yet granted.

He is at pre&s;ent here, and that which gives much oc|ca&s;ion of Di&s;cour&s;e, is his Excellency's making a very extraordinary Court to him, more than he has been &s;een to do to any Per&s;on what&s;oever; and that which makes the more notice taken of it, is, becau&s;e there was &s;o very ill a Corre&s;pon|dence lately between them. The Queen has not yet di&s;po&s;ed of the Government of the Province of <HI>Namur</HI>, there being &s;o many Pretenders to it that it is not known who will carry it.</P>
<P>It's &s;aid Count <HI>d'Ur&s;el</HI> is in Election of be|ing made Captain of the Guard of Archers, if the Place of the late Marque&s;s <HI>Tirloon</HI>, and that that Charge will be confirm'd upon him a <HI>Madrid</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="204">From the Confederate Armies near <HI>Strasburgh</HI> it's written, That Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turenne</HI> &s;till conti|nues his Camp, and that both Armies are watch|ing each other, and that which can hold out lon|ge&s;t is like to be Ma&s;ter of the Field.</P>
<P>On Friday his Excellency had notice, by Ex|pre&s;s, of the taking <HI>Dinant</HI> Town and Ca&s;tle, which happen'd &s;ooner than they could have i|magined, and by an Accident they little expected. The Place being entred by fifty <HI>Spaniards</HI> who were only employ'd about taking a &s;mall part of the Suburbs, whil&s;t the <HI>Germans</HI> were battering the Walls: And it &s;eems tho&s;e of the Garri&s;on that were in the Suburbs being in &s;ome Di&s;order, two of the principal <HI>French</HI> Commanders came out of the Town to make good their Retreat into it, who being both killed in the Action, the <HI>French</HI> retired in great Di&s;order, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fol|low'd &s;o clo&s;e, that immediately a Parley was &s;ounded, and &s;oon after both Town and Ca&s;tle &s;urrendred upon Capitulations that the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould march away with Bag and Baggage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but all the Ligeois Pri&s;oners of War, and the late Governor who &s;urpriz'd it from the <HI>Germans</HI>.</P>
<P>It's &s;aid that General <HI>Spork</HI> has &s;ent part of his Army towards <HI>Thuin</HI>, to try if he can reduce that &s;trong Place, which would be of great Con&s;e|quence to the incommoding of <HI>Charleroy</HI>. 'Tis al&s;o &s;aid that he will next attempt <HI>Bouillon</HI>, and then advance towards <HI>Treves</HI>, unle&s;s the Commo|tions at <HI>Liege</HI> may encourage his going that way. We do here confidently affirm that <HI>Treves</HI> is at lea&s;t clo&s;ely blocked up, if not formally be&s;ieged; though at the &s;ame time others &s;ay, That Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Turenne</HI> has &s;ent thither two thou&s;and five hundred Men, who are entred into it; which, if
<PB N="152" REF="205">
true, the reducing that Place may prove a Work of Time; but if tho&s;e Recruits are &s;hut out, they make no que&s;tion of reducing it &s;uddenly. It is written al&s;o from <HI>Germany</HI>, that both <HI>Philipsburgh</HI> and <HI>$$$$$ck</HI> are much &s;treighten'd by the Po&s;t which the Confederates have taken round about them.</P>
<P>We talk here as if the <HI>French</HI> King had &s;ome Thoughts of coming e'er long to <HI>Nancy</HI>, to be near <HI>Al&s;ace</HI> and <HI>Burgundy</HI>, and to be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turenne</HI> upon any Occa&s;ion; and that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> will at the &s;ame time come towards <HI>Douay</HI>, and tho&s;e Parts; but we have no Cer|tainty of this, but only Surmi&s;es.</P>
<P>Count <HI>de Ra&s;ch</HI> is by his Excellency appointed to go &s;uddenly to <HI>Ypres</HI> to command there in the place of Baron <HI>de Rock</HI>, who comes hither, and &s;hall command at <HI>Louvain</HI>.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday being his Excellency's Birth-day there was a great Solemnity at Court, which ended at Night in a Ball for the Diverti&s;ement of the Ladies.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Philip Ba&s;&s;igny</HI> has been very ill of a Fever, but is now pretty well; I gave him this Evening a Vi&s;it&punc; and found him in his Bed, but much better than he was: His Brother Count <HI>Ba&s;|&s;$gny</HI> who was with him, told me they had both intentions of ki&s;&s;ing your Lord&s;hip's Hands in <HI>Holland</HI> before your Return, if his Brother's Health would permit.

<P>HIS Excellency being much un&s;atisfied with the unu&s;ual Delays made by the States in <HI>Flanders</HI> concerning their Sub&s;idies for the Year en&s;uing, has thereupon thought nece&s;&s;ary for re|moving all Difficulties, and bringing that Matter to a &s;peedy I&s;&s;ue, which is of &s;o great Con&s;e|quence for carrying on the War, to &s;end for tho&s;e States hither, and accordingly they are all expe|cted here this Night. <HI>(viz.)</HI> two Abbots for the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, two Deputies for <HI>Bruges</HI>, two for the <HI>Free</HI>, two for <HI>Gaunt</HI>, and two for <HI>Ypres</HI>; and till the&s;e have adju&s;ted their Proportions for <HI>Flan|ders</HI>, all the other Provinces are at a &s;tand. The true Rea&s;on of this their long Delay, is the great Pove$ty that Province is really reduced to; &s;o that when they have adju&s;ted their Quota's, they
<PB N="155" REF="208">
know not which way to rai&s;e the Money, this War having brought &s;uch Mi&s;ery upon them, which has made them much inclinable to Peace, if an honourable one may be procur'd.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Vaudemont</HI> goes in few Days for <HI>Spain</HI>, in relation to the Affairs of this Country as well as for his own particular Concerns, ha|ving receiv'd a Pa&s;sport from <HI>France</HI> for his free Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>We hear from <HI>Liege</HI>, that General <HI>Spork</HI> has &s;ent thither to demand Quarter there for five Regi|ments of his Army this Winter; and that unle&s;s they will admit it, he will endeavour to force them. It's &s;aid, that he has detached Three thou|&s;and Men towards <HI>Treves</HI>, and that he will en|deavour to reduce <HI>Bouillon</HI> and <HI>Thuin</HI>, the la&s;t of which will much incommode <HI>Charleroy</HI>; but we think it will not &s;o ea&s;ily be taken as <HI>Dinant</HI>. If he have Succe&s;s in tho&s;e Places, he will then make Incur&s;ions into the <HI>French</HI> Territories, and Winter-quarter upon their Borders.</P>
<P>His Excellency has this Day receiv'd Letters from <HI>Germany</HI>, by which he is a&s;&s;ured that the greate&s;t part of the Confederates Armies are mar|ching towards <HI>Burgundy</HI>, thereby to oblige Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Turenne</HI> to decamp.

<P>ON Friday Morning being inform'd by Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> the Con&s;ul, that he had the Night before been &s;erv'd with an Order by the Court of Admi|ralty here in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>George</HI> of <HI>London</HI>; we thereupon went to con&s;ult with Council therein, who much wondring at the unu&s;ual Se|verity thereof, advi&s;ed I &s;hould that Day pre&s;ent a Memorial to his Excellency, which I did accor|dingly, and took Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> with me. I acquain|ted his Excellency with the Strangene&s;s of &s;uch Proceedings, that the Court of Admiralty by an interlo$u$$ry Order &s;hould appoint the Lading of a Ship of Ten thou&s;and Pounds Value, being all Piece Goods, and no peri&s;hable Commodities to
<PB N="157" REF="210">
be &s;old by the Capers without Caution, and be|fore a definitive Sentence; and that neither the Parties concern'd, nor their Council had &s;een the Proofs, or any of their Proceedings, and there|fore pray'd his Excellency would interpo&s;e his Authority for &s;topping the Sale not only of this, but of all other Ships belonging to any of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, till a definitive Sentence had been given, and his Excellency con&s;ulted therein. And that for the Original Contract in this parti|cular Ca&s;e, of which they had an authentick Copy, we would engage it &s;hould be brought hither in fifteen Days, an Expre&s;s being &s;ent to <HI>O&s;tend</HI> for it. But in ca&s;e upon &s;ight of that Con|tract the Proce&s;s &s;hould go for the Owners, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to have Re&s;titution, if this Sale &s;hould be permitted, &s;ince it was well known at what Rates the Capers us'd to &s;ell, and that no more could be an&s;wer'd than for what they &s;old.</P>
<P>His Excellency in his An&s;wer was very &s;hort, and &s;omething quick, and told us, that their Pro|ceedings here were no more unu&s;ual than ours in <HI>Eng$$nd</HI>, for that there was at this time a Cap|tain o$ <HI>O&s;tend</HI> Pri&s;oner in <HI>England</HI>, without any legal Pr$ce&s;s&punc; and when I told him it was for an unheard of In&s;olency committed upon one of his Maje&s;ty's Ships, his Excellency reply$d, he &s;hould then have been &s;ent back to him that he might h$ve puni&s;hed him, which was all the An&s;wer $e could get: And this Morning I have received $word$ An&s;wer to my Memorial, that I &s;hould ad|dre&s;s my &s;elf to the Court of Admiralty, to whom $e recommended it to do Ju&s;tice, as it I could $ot have done that without $word$ Recommendation. $word$ th$$ as far $word$ I can rea&s;onably judge, we are
<PB N="158" REF="211">
not like to find any Ju&s;tice among&s;t them, at lea&s;t it will be attended with &s;o long Delays and great Charges, that there will be little difference be|twixt our Merchants giving up their Ships, and &s;eeking Relief. It being a &s;evere Truth, that the Capers have di&s;pers'd &s;o much Money to make an Intere&s;t here, that they account all the Ships they have taken as much their own, as if they were condemn'd already; and 'tis more than probable that tho&s;e Papers are conceal'd which &s;hould make for the Owner's Advantage, otherwi&s;e we cannot imagine upon what ground they could make this Order, the Property of that Ship (as Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> informs me) and the Lading being re|ally prov'd to belong to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, and was taken going from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Dunkirk</HI>; &s;o that by the Proceedings of this we judge all the re&s;t lo&s;t.</P>
<P>They are this Day begun upon Mr. <HI>Graunt</HI>'s Ship that came from <HI>Tangier</HI>, and had in her be|&s;ides her rich Lading Forty thou&s;and Pieces of Eight, and we make no que&s;tion but they will likewi&s;e condemn her. I have &s;ent Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI> a particular Account, to give his Ma|je&s;ty full and true Information, and am in ex|pectation of receiving Orders from his Honour how I &s;hall govern my &s;elf therein. In the Inte|rim I conceiv'd it my Duty to give your Lord|&s;hip this Account, that your Honour may &s;ee how Affairs go here; and I have inclo&s;ed a Copy of the Order for the Sale of the Lading, though there is al&s;o a Mi&s;take in the Original Order, naming the Ship St. <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> for St. <HI>George</HI>; of which if Advantage can be taken it &s;hall not be lo&s;t.</P>

<P>This Morning Count <HI>de Ra&s;ch</HI> went towards <HI>Flanders</HI> with the Troops that were here and in the adjacent Places, and the Troops in <HI>Louvain</HI> and tho&s;e Quarters are march'd towards <HI>Liege</HI> to join with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Louvigny</HI> and the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI>, who are in great hopes of being &s;uddenly Ma&s;ters of the City and Cittadel of <HI>La$ge</HI>, and of making the Cardinal of <HI>Baden</HI> Coadjutor to the Prince</P>
<P>It is written from that Army, that they have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed all the Eminencies round about <HI>L$$ge</HI> and ve|ry near to the Town, having taken all the Po&s;ts that are nece&s;&s;ary to prevent any thing going in or out to them on both &s;ides the <HI>M$u$$</HI>, and $$ve fixed a principal Quarter at the Charter hou&s;e, that there are great Di&s;orders in the $word$, the Party of the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> being ready to cut the Throats of the <HI>French</HI> Party, &s;o that they doubt not but thee &s;hall be receiv$d into the City, and re|duce that Cittadel under the Emperor's Obedience, the Pre&s;ence of the Cardinal having made great Alterations in the Affections of that People.</P>

<P>And we are told from <HI>Germany</HI>, that the Di|vi&s;ions among&s;t the Confederate Generals are in|crea&s;ed &s;ince the Retreat of Mare&s;chal <HI>Turenne</HI>, and that the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> has ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to advance any farther with his Army, as was de&s;ired by &s;ome of the others, declaring he will not ruin his Army which he may have need of at home; which Re&s;olution has not only hindred their following Mare&s;chal <HI>Turenne</HI>, but al&s;o their advancing into <HI>Bur|gundy</HI>.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of our Ships goes on as it did they condemning all that come before them: That Ship wherein was the Money that cam$ from <HI>Tangiers</HI>, they have not condemned, bu$ they have given an Order to the Ma&s;ter to a+gree

Preparations in <HI>Spain</HI>, both by Land and Sea, are de&s;ign'd for reducing of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI>, all that Affair being wholly remitted to the Care of <HI>Don Juan</HI>, who goes in Per&s;on into <HI>Italy</HI> Vicar General, and is to command all the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Domini|ons there and in <HI>Sicily</HI>, for the better carrying on the War again&s;t the rebellious <HI>Me&s;&s;ine&s;es</HI>; that there are no Preparations for any Supplies for the&s;e Provinces, nor any Ma&s;ter de Camp Ge|neral named, nor any Governor for the Province of <HI>Namur</HI>, but that Monies will be remitted hi|ther by <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI>.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Ar&s;chott</HI> is fallen here dangerou&s;ly &s;ick of a continued violent burning Feaver, he hath been three times let Blood in the Arm, and the Feaver &s;till continuing, he was this Morning let Blood in the Foot; the Feaver is accompany|ed with a great Oppre&s;&s;ion of Flegm and Choler at his Stomach, and not without &s;ome ill Symp|toms, which occa&s;ions frequent Con&s;ultations a|mong&s;t all the Doctors in Town.</P>
<P>Baron <HI>de Bergeyk</HI> has been &s;omething indi&s;po|&s;ed the&s;e two Days, which has retarded his go|ing for <HI>Flanders</HI>, but he now intends to depart to Morrow, and after receiving his Excellency's In|&s;tructions to ha&s;ten to <HI>O&s;tend</HI>, in Expectation of meeting a Yatch for his Tran&s;portation, his Excel|lency having written to his Maje&s;ty for one. We are here four Po&s;ts behind from <HI>England</HI>, and we are inform'd that both Packets were fourteen Days at <HI>Newport</HI>, and could not get our to Sea till <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> la&s;t.</P>
<P>As for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our &s;ecured Ships, the Court of Admiralty daily proceed here, and do now acknowledge the Articles of 67 as the Rule
<PB N="168" REF="221">
to walk by, and do nothing in any Ca&s;e before them without con&s;ulting tho&s;e Articles.</P>
<P>There hath been two or three Ships condemn'd by them, occa&s;ion'd purely by the Confe&s;&s;ions and Depo&s;itions of the Ma&s;ters and Seamen, who ac|knowledge their Bills of Lading to be fal&s;e, and taken only <HI>pro form&acirc;</HI>, and that their true Bills of Lading were &s;ent over Land from <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> to <HI>Dun|kirk</HI>, whither they were really bound.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter of the Ship that came from <HI>Tan|$ier</HI> has al&s;o compounded, fearing a Sentence a|gain&s;t him; mo&s;t of his Mony and Lading being taken in at <HI>Cadiz</HI> upon <HI>French</HI> Account, and the Ship really belonging to a <HI>French</HI> Man at <HI>St. Ma|lces</HI>, as he him&s;elf voluntarily confe&s;&s;ed to the Ad|miralty of <HI>O&s;tend</HI>.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit likewi&s;e to acquaint your Lord&s;hip, that upon a more narrow Enquiry we find there has been much Deceit u&s;ed by the Ma|&s;ters of many of tho&s;e Ships in que&s;tion, that after they have been laded in <HI>France</HI>, they have made to the <HI>Downs</HI> for their Security, and from thence gotten Pa&s;&s;ports from the Mayor of <HI>Do|v$r</HI>, and thereby avoided paying his Maje&s;ty's Cu|&s;toms; and then they have returned again to|wards <HI>$$ance</HI> by vertue of &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ports. And &s;o after having deceiv'd his Maje&s;ty of his right, then they procure his Letters in their Favour. This, I can a&s;&s;ure your Honour, we find to be the $word$ Ca&s;e of tho&s;e Ships that have been hitherto q$$&s;tion'd, their Bills of Lading being all to <HI>En|$$$$</HI> Ports, to which they never went, but after being in the <HI>Downs</HI> have returned back again to <HI>Fr$nc$</HI> Ports, and &s;o taken; which I conceive my &s;elf oblig'd to give your Lord&s;hip a true Ac|count
<PB N="169" REF="222">
of, having done the like to Mr. Secreta|ry <HI>Coventry</HI>. However, there &s;hall be nothing wanting on my part, either in Care, or diligent Application for their Di&s;charge.</P>
<P>I have nothing more to add in this Particular, nor any thing el&s;e of News, but what the inclo|&s;ed Paper will inform, and therefore I &s;hall end your Honour's farther Trouble, by &s;ub&s;cribing my &s;elf with all imaginable Zeal and Duty,</P>

<P>I Am told in Confidence, from a very good Hand, that this unu&s;ual Proceeding of his Excellency, in &s;ending his Major Generals into the &s;everal Provinces, has given great Di&s;ta&s;ts to the Governours of tho&s;e Provinces, and that the Duke of <HI>Ar&s;chot</HI>'s Sickne&s;s was principally occa|&s;ion'd by a Di&s;gu&s;t he took upon that Account, and &s;ome other ill U&s;age from his Excellency.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="223">That the Night preceding his Excellency's go|ing for <HI>Flanders</HI> he &s;pake to the Duke to return to his Government, who gave him for An&s;wer, That he would no more return thither, nor inter|meddle in his Government, 'till he had Satisfa|ction given him in Point of his Honour, and that the Privileges of his Government were re&s;tored to him; and that he had written to the Queen to know her Plea&s;ure, whether he &s;hould have his Privileges made good to him, which were granted him by Patent from his Catholick Maje&s;ty; that he did not much value the Lo&s;s of his E&s;tate in this War, which was but a &s;mall Sacrifice to his Maje&s;ty's Service, but that now his Reputation and Honour were at Stake, much dearer to him than his Life or E&s;tate; and that if the Queen thought not fit to do him right in what he de&s;i|red, he would then &s;erve his Maje&s;ty with a Pike in his Hand, but in no other Capacity; and that till he &s;hould receive her Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer, he wou'd no$ return to, nor meddle in his Govern|ment. This I am a&s;&s;ur'd he &s;pake, and much more, and that in his Letters to <HI>Spain</HI> he has min|gled much G$ll in his Ink.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday his Lady arrived almo&s;t drown'd in $ears, and in the mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate Condition i|maginable, finding the Duke extremely ill, ha|ving then receiv$d the la&s;t Rights of the Church, and made his Will in Pre&s;ence of Duke <HI>de Vil$$ Herm$$a</HI> and many others, there being then little Hopes of his Life. The Dutche&s;s brought with her a Dict t$ $$om <HI>Mans</HI>, who, being better ac+qu$in$ed with the Duke's Con&s;titution than the <HI>Dra&s;$$$</HI> Doctors, pre&s;crib'd him &s;omething la&s;$ N$ght, which had &s;o good Operation that he re&s;t+ed
<PB N="171" REF="224">
well, and though his Feaver &s;till continues, yet there is this Day great Hopes of his Recovery, which much rejoices the Hearts of many, he be|ing extremely beloved of all &s;orts, both Civil, Mi|litary, and Religious, and his Death in this Con|juncture would be an unvaluable Lo&s;s to this Country.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Motte</HI> has been al&s;o dangerou&s;ly &s;ick, but not &s;o much griev'd for; he is now upon his Recovery, and Baron <HI>Bergeyk</HI> is &s;o well that he re&s;olves to go to Morrow to meet his Excel|lency at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, hoping there to receive his Di|&s;patches, that he may from thence go forward towards <HI>O&s;tend</HI>.</P>
<P>We hear from <HI>Luxemburgh</HI>, the Prince <HI>de Chimay</HI> is &s;o much un&s;atisfied with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> coming thither, with a Power Inde|pendent from his, that he is coming hither in great Di&s;content, and will not return to his Go|vernment whil&s;t the other &s;tays there. The like is fear'd will be done by Prince <HI>Ro$beck</HI> in <HI>Artois</HI>, and Prince <HI>Mammy</HI> in <HI>Gueldres</HI>, which the Count <HI>de Ra&s;ch</HI> well fore&s;eeing, offered to lay down his Commi&s;&s;ion to his Excellency, rather than go thither, affirming it would be to his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;&s;ervice; however, his Excellency would hear no Excu&s;e, but he mu&s;t either go to <HI>Ruremond</HI> or <HI>Vilvord</HI> Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Neither are the Governours of Provinces only di&s;&s;atisfyed in this Particular, but al&s;o that his Excellency has placed Sur Intendants in each Province to beard the Governours, and are as Controllers upon them; they being never u&s;ed in any of the&s;e Provinces but only in <HI>Flanders</HI>, where the Sur Intendant commands as Governour.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="225">The&s;e are all the vi&s;ible Preparations which are made here for this next Campaign, the Con|&s;equence of which may be ea&s;ily fore&s;een. And though they generally rail again&s;t Count <HI>de Horn, de Ruiter</HI>, and <HI>Van Trump</HI>, for doing nothing in their Behalf at Sea, yet they hope to be more vi|gorou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the next Campaign by Land, by his Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>, upon whom all their Hopes depend; there being no talk of any Supplies from <HI>Spain</HI>, neither are they recrui|ting their Troops nor making any Levies, whil&s;t they find great Difficulty to pay tho&s;e they have, and are this Year fallen two Months &s;hort of what they promis'd; but in the new Conque&s;ts we are told the <HI>French</HI> make all imaginable Prepa|rations.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Flanders</HI> have at la&s;t agreed for their next Years Sub&s;idies at fifteen thou&s;and Rations, the one half of what his Excellency de|manded, and eight thou&s;and le&s;s than they gave la&s;t Year, declaring they know not where to rai&s;e this, and their Propo&s;ition of fixing a Quar|ter at <HI>Fuerns</HI>, for increa&s;ing their Sub&s;idies, was not accepted by his Excellency.</P>
<P>This Abatement in their Sub&s;idies will be fol|lowed by this Province, e&s;pecially by this City, who &s;eem much un&s;atisfy'd for Impri&s;onment of their Magi&s;trates, which they are like to &s;hew when Occa&s;ion &s;erves.</P>
<P>It is whi&s;per'd here very &s;trongly, that though his Excellency leaves not this Government &s;o &s;oon as was expected, yet that he will be removed before the next Campaign, it being confidently reported the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> &s;hall &s;ucceed him, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time, and great Court
<PB N="173" REF="226">
and Applications are already made to him upon that Account; and I am a&s;&s;ur'd from a good Hand that there is more than ordinary ground for it, and that the principal Cau&s;e of Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI>'s Departure for <HI>Spain</HI> was to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the Charge of General of the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Duke <HI>de Montalto</HI> has made a &s;tep hither from <HI>Gaunt</HI>, whil&s;t his Excellency has been there, not enduring the &s;mell of the Court, and &s;o &s;oon as he hears his Excellency is at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, he will return to <HI>Gaunt</HI>.</P>
<P>Our Letters from <HI>Aix la Cbappelle</HI> tell us, that the Prince <HI>de Salm</HI> continues &s;till very ill, with a Brui&s;e he received by a Fall in his Coach; and the la&s;t Letters from <HI>Strasburgh</HI> &s;ay, the Con|federates (notwith&s;tanding they are in their W$n|ter Quarters) have left eight thou&s;and Men in their Camp near that City, which are releived each fifteen Days, that there is great fear le&s;t the Duke <HI>de Hannover</HI> &s;hould joyn his Forces with the <HI>Swedes</HI>; but of all the&s;e Affairs 'tis needle&s;s to give your Lord&s;hip an Account, &s;ince it comes much earlier and truer to the <HI>Ha$ue</HI> th$n hither.</P>
<P>As to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of $span$ $+miralty &s;it $word$ and condemn all Ships that they have hitherto que&s;tion'd; tho&s;e that are un|doubtedly <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, and their Lading not Cou$$erband Goods, run the &s;ame Fortune with the re&s;t, for they will hear nothing as to Proof on our pa$$$ and where there is the lea&s;t Ap|pearance of $$$ud, by double Bills of Lading, or Contradiction $n the Te&s;timony of the Ma&s;ters and Mariners, they never hear more, but condemn them to lo&s;e all, and to pay Co&s;t and Charges.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="227">Of all the&s;e Proceedings I have given particu|lar Accounts to Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI>, but four or five of our Packets being &s;taid at <HI>Newport</HI> till Thur&s;day in the la&s;t Week; I have not yet re|ceiv'd any farther Directions how to govern my &s;elf, which I hope to have this Night or to Mor|row, we being now two Po&s;ts in Arrear, having received three on Tue&s;day Night.</P>

<P>LAST Night his Excellency returned hither from <HI>Flanders</HI>, having &s;tay'd two Days at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, and notwith&s;tanding that Province would not be induced to give more than Fifteen thou&s;and
<PB N="175" REF="228">
Rations: Yet they have made his Excellency a con&s;iderable Pre&s;ent as to his own Particular of One hundred thou&s;and Crowns, a great part of which his Excellency has di&s;po&s;ed of at <HI>Antwerp</HI> in fine Pictures, Hangings and other Curio&s;ities to &s;end for <HI>Spain</HI>.</P>
<P>This Day the News was very warm at Court, that the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> under the Command of Prince <HI>de Baden Dourlach</HI> to the number of Twelve thou|&s;and Hor&s;e have entred <HI>Burgundy</HI>, whil&s;t on the other hand the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> has made a great Incur&s;ion into his own Territories, and that many have taken Arms with him: It's al&s;o written that <HI>Bri&s;ack</HI> is very much &s;treighten'd, mo&s;t of the Mills about the Town being de&s;troy'd, and the Town &s;o blocked up on all &s;ides, with &s;o many People in it, that they will &s;uddenly be reduced to great Nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>Letters of a late Date from <HI>Luxenburgh</HI> tell us, the Prince <HI>de Chimay</HI> their Governour is fallen &s;ud|denly and dangerou&s;ly ill of a Lethargy, but there was hopes of Recovery.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Ar&s;chet</HI> is &s;till alive, though not likely long to continue &s;o.
