<P>The Purport of the above Fable is this. When the She-Goats had, by their intreaties, obtained of Jupiter the privilege of having Beards as well as the Males, the He-Goats grew angry; and complained, that he had degraded their dignity by admitting the females to equal honours with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>To which the God replied, That if they would take care to pre&s;erve the real and e&s;&s;ential advantages which their &s;ex gave them over the other, they would have no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with letting them participate in what was merely ornamental.</P>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now, when <HI>you</HI> appear before 'em,</L>
<L>You want all deference, and decorum;</L>
<L>And, con&s;cious of good Heav'n knows what,</L>
<L>Noddle your heads, and &s;louch your hat;</L>
<L>Or, carele&s;s of the circling throng,</L>
