<P>Hear me, Valverde.&mdash;When fir&s;t my
virgin fancy waked to love, Pizarro was my
country's idol. Self-taught, &s;elf-rai&s;ed, and &s;elf|&s;upported,
he became a hero; and I was formed
to be won by glory and renown. 'Tis known
that when he left Panama in a &s;light ve&s;&s;el, his
force was not an hundred men. Arrived in the
i&s;land of Gallo; with his &s;word he drew a line
upon the &s;ands, and &s;aid, &startq;Pa&s;s tho&s;e who
to die or conquer with their leader.&endq; Thirteen
alone remained, and at the head of the&s;e the
warrior &s;tood his ground. Even at the moment
when my ears fir&s;t caught this tale, my heart
exclaimed, &startq;Pizarro is its lord!&endq; What &s;ince I
have perceived, or thought, or felt! you mu&s;t
have more worth to win the knowledge of.</P>

<P>Alonzo! the traitor! How I once loved
that man! His noble mother entru&s;ted him, a
boy, to my protection. At my table did he
fea&s;t&mdash;in my tent did he repo&s;e. I had marked
his early genius, and the valorous &s;pirit that
grew with it. Often I had talked to him of our
fir&s;t adventures&mdash;what &s;torms we &s;truggled with
&mdash;what perils we &s;urmounted. When landed
with a &s;lender ho&s;t upon an unknown land&mdash;

then, when I told how famine and fatigue, di&s;|cord

and my power in de&s;pite of growling mutiny or
bold revolt, till with my faithful few remaining I
became at la&s;t victorious!&mdash;When, I &s;ay, of the&s;e
things I &s;poke, the youth, Alonzo, with tears of
wonder and delight, would throw him on my
neck, and &s;wear, his &s;oul's ambition owned no

<P>Las Ca&s;as&mdash;he it was, with fa&s;cinating
craft and canting precepts of humanity, rai&s;ed

&s;ued to win me from my purpo&s;e, and untwine

&s;poke of right, of ju&s;tice and humanity, calling
the Peruvians our innocent and unoffending
