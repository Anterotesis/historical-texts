<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1689.</NOTE> THE con&s;titution of England had now a&s;&s;umed a new a&s;pect. The maxim of hereditary, indefea&s;ible right, was at length re|nounced by a free parliament. The power of the crown was acknowledged to flow from no other fountain than that of a contract with the people. Allegiance and protection were declared reciprocal ties depending upon each other. The repre&s;entatives of the nation made a regular claim of rights in behalf of their con&s;tituents; and William III. a&s;cended the throne in con&s;equence of an expre&s;s capitulation with the people. Yet on this occa&s;ion, the zeal of the parliament towards their deliverer, &s;eems to have over&s;hot their attachment to their own liberty and privileges: or at lea&s;t they neglected the faire&s;t opportunity that ever occurred, to retrench tho&s;e prerogatives of the crown to which they imputed all the late and former calamities of the king|dom. Their new monarch retained the old regal power over parliaments, in its full extent. He was left at liberty to convoke, adjourn, prorogue, and di&s;|&s;olve them at his plea&s;ure. He was enabled to influence elections and oppre&s;s corporations. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right of chu&s;ing his own council; of nominat|ing all the great officers of the &s;tate, and of the hou&s;hold, of the army, the navy, and the church. He re&s;erved the ab&s;olute command of the militia: &s;o that he remained ma&s;ter of all the in&s;truments and engines of corruption and violence, without any other re&s;traint than his own moderation, and pru|dent regard to the claim of rights and principle of re&s;i&s;tance on which the re|volution was founded. In a word, the &s;ettlement was fini&s;hed with &s;ome precipitation, before the plan had been properly dige&s;ted and matured; and this will be the ca&s;e in every e&s;tabli&s;hment formed upon a &s;udden emergency in the face of oppo&s;ition. It was ob&s;erved, that the king, who was made by the people, had it in his power to rule without them; to govern jure divino, though he was created jure humano; and that, though the change proceeded from a republican &s;pirit, the &s;ettlement was built upon tory maxims; for, the execution of his government continued &s;till independent of his commi&s;&s;ion, while his own per&s;on remained &s;acred and inviolable. The prince of Orange had been invited to England by a coalition of parties, united by a common &s;en&s;e of danger; but this tie was no &s;ooner broken, than they flew a&s;under, and each re&s;umed its original bia&s;s. Their mutual jealou&s;y and rancour re|vived, and was heated by di&s;pute into intemperate zeal and enthu&s;ia&s;m. Tho&s;e who at fir&s;t acted from principles of patrioti&s;m, were in&s;en&s;ibly warmed into parti&s;ans; and king William &s;oon found him&s;elf at the head of a faction. As he had been bred a calvini&s;t, and always expre&s;&s;ed an abhorrence of &s;piritual
<PB N="3" REF="60">
per&s;ecution, the pre&s;byterians, and other prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, con&s;idered him as their peculiar protector, and entered into his intere&s;ts with the mo&s;t zealous fervour and a&s;&s;iduity. For the &s;ame rea&s;ons, the friends of the church be|came jealous of his proceedings, and employed all their influence, fir&s;t in op|po&s;ing his elevation to the throne, and afterwards in thwarting his mea&s;ures. Their party was e&s;pou&s;ed by all the friends of the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; by the ro|man catholics; by tho&s;e who were per&s;onally attached to the late king, and by &s;uch as were di&s;gu&s;ted by the conduct and per&s;onal deportment of William &s;ince his arrival in England. They ob&s;erved, That contrary to his declaration, he had plainly a&s;pired to the crown; and treated his father-in-law with in&s;o|lence and rigour: That his army contained a number of foreign papi&s;ts, almo&s;t equal to that of the Engli&s;h roman catholics whom James had employed: that the reports &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated about the birth of the prince of Wales, the treaty with France for en&s;laving England, and the murder of the earl of E&s;&s;ex; reports countenanced by the prince of Orange, now appeared to be without foundation: That the Dutch troops remained in London, while the Engli&s;h forces were di&s;tributed in remote quarters: That the prince de|clared the fir&s;t &s;hould be kept about his per&s;on, and the latter &s;ent to Ireland: That the two hou&s;es, out of complai&s;ance to William, had denied their late &s;o|vereign the ju&s;tice of being heard in his own defence; and, That the Dutch had lately interfered with the trade of London, which was already &s;en&s;ibly di|mini&s;hed. The&s;e were the &s;ources of di&s;content, &s;welled up by the re&s;entment<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somers's Col|lection. Rere&s;by.

<P>William began his reign with a proclamation, for confirming all pro|te&s;tants in the offices which they enjoyed on the fir&s;t day of December: then he cho&s;e the members of his council, who were generally &s;taunch to his in|tere&s;t, except the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and the earl of Nottingham <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The council con&s;i&s;ted of the prince of Den|mark, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the duke of Norfolk, the marqui&s;&s;es of Hallifax and Win|che&s;ter, the earls of Danby, Lind&s;ey, Devon|&s;hire, Dor&s;et, and Middle&s;ex, Oxford, Shrew&s;|bury, Bedford, Bath, Macclesfield, Nottingham; the vi&s;counts Falconberge, Mordaunt, Newport, Lumley; the lords Wharton, Montague, Dela|mere, Churchill; Mr. Bentinck, Mr. Sidney, Sir Robert Howard, Sir Henry Capel, Mr. Powle, Mr. Ru&s;&s;el, Mr. Hambden, and Mr. Bo&s;cawen.</NOTE>; and the&s;e were admitted in complai&s;ance to the church-party, which it was not thought advi&s;eable to provoke. Nottingham and Shrew&s;bury were appointed &s;ecretaries of &s;tate: the privy-&s;eal was be&s;towed upon the marquis of Hallifax: the earl of Danby was created pre&s;ident of the council. The&s;e two noblemen enjoyed a good &s;hare of the king's confidence; and Nottingham was con|&s;iderable as head of the church-party: but the chief favourite was Bentinck, fir&s;t commoner on the li&s;t of privy-coun&s;ellors, as well as groom of the &s;tole and privy pur&s;e. D'Auverquerque was made ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, Zuyle&s;tein of the robes, and Schomberg of the ordnance: the trea&s;ury, admiralty, and chancery, were put in commi&s;&s;ion; twelve able judges were cho&s;en <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir John Holt was appointed lord chief ju&s;|tice of the king's-bench, and Sir Henry Pollexfen of the common-pleas; the earl of Devon&s;hire was made lord-&s;teward of the hou&s;hold, and the earl of Dor&s;et lord-chamberlain. <BIBL>Ralph.</BIBL></NOTE>; and the dioce&s;e of Sali&s;bury being vacated by the death of doctor Ward, the king, of his own free motion, filled it with Burnet, who had been a zealous &s;tickler for his intere&s;t; and, in a particular manner, in&s;trumental in effecting the revolution. Sancroft archbi&s;hop of Canterbury refu&s;ed to con&s;ecrate this eccle&s;ia&s;tic,
<PB N="4" REF="70">
though the rea&s;ons of his refu&s;al are not &s;pecified; but, being afraid of incurring the penalties of a premu$ire, he granted a commi&s;&s;ion to the bi|&s;hop of London, and three other &s;uffragans, to perform that ceremony. Burnet was a prelate of &s;ome parts, and great indu&s;try; moderate in his notions of church di&s;cipline, $word$ meddling, vain, and credulous. In con&s;equence of having incurred the $word$ of the late king, he had retired to the con|tinent, and fixed his re&s;idence in Holland, where he was naturalized, and at|tached him&s;elf to the intere&s;t of the prince of Orange, who con&s;ulted him about the affairs of England. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted in drawing up the prince's manife&s;to, and wrote &s;ome other papers and pamphlets in defence of his de&s;ign. He was demanded of the &s;tates, by the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, as a Briti&s;h fugitive, out|lawed by king James, and excepted in the act of indemnity: neverthele&s;s, he came over with William, in quality of his chaplain; and, by his intrigues, contributed in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the &s;ucce&s;s of that expedition. The prin|cipal individuals that compo&s;ed this mini&s;try, have been characteri&s;ed in the hi&s;tory of the preceding reigns. We have had occa&s;ion to mention the fine talents, the vivacity, the flexibility of Hallifax; the pl$u&s;ibility, the enterpri&s;|ing genius, the ob&s;tinacy of Danby; the pompous eloquence, the warmth, and o&s;t$ntation of Nottingham; the probity and popularity of Shrew&s;bury. Go|dolphin, now brought into the trea&s;ury, was mode&s;t, &s;ilent, &s;agacious, and up|right. Mordau$t, appointed fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of that board, and afterwards created earl of Monmouth, was open, generous, and a republican in his princi|ples. Delamere, chancellor of the exchequer, promoted in the &s;equel to the rank of earl of Warrington, was clo&s;e and mercenary. Ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, fidelity, and attachment to his ma&s;ter, compo&s;ed the character of Bentinck, whom the king rai&s;ed to the dignity of earl of Portland. The Engli&s;h favourite Sidney was a man of wit and plea&s;ure, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t engaging talents for con|ver&s;ation and private friend&s;hip, but rendered unfit for public bu&s;ine&s;s by in|dolence and inattention. He was ennobled, and afterwards created earl of Romney, a title which he enjoyed with &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive po&s;ts of profit and im|portance. The &s;tream of honour and preferment ran &s;trong in favour of the Whigs, and this appearance of partiality confirmed the &s;u&s;picion and re&s;ent|ment of the oppo&s;ite party.</P>

<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; III.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t re&s;olution taken in the new council was to convert the convention into a parliament, that the new &s;ettlement might be &s;trength|ened by a legal &s;anction, which was now &s;uppo&s;ed to be wanting, as the a&s;&s;em|bly had not been convoked by the king's writ of &s;ummons. The experiment of a new election was deemed too hazardous; therefore, the council determined that the king &s;hould, by virtue of his own authority, change the convention into a parliament, by going to the hou&s;e of peers with the u&s;ual &s;tate of a &s;overeign, and pronouncing a &s;peech from the throne to both hou&s;es. This expedient was accordingly practi&s;ed. He a&s;&s;ured them he &s;hould never take any &s;tep that would dimini&s;h the good opinion they had conceived of his integrity. He told them that Holland was in &s;uch a &s;ituation as required their immediate attention and a&s;&s;i&s;tance: that the po&s;ture of affairs at home likewi&s;e demanded their &s;eri|ous con&s;ideration: that a good &s;ettlement was nece&s;&s;ary not only for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of dome&s;tic peace, but al&s;o for the &s;upport of the prote&s;tant intere&s;t abroad: that the affairs of Ireland were too critically &s;ituated to admit of the lea&s;t delay in their deliberations: he therefore begged they would be &s;peedy and effectual in concerting &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould be judged indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="5" REF="80">
for the welfare of the nation. The commons returning to their hou&s;e, imme|diately pa&s;&s;ed a vote of thanks to his maje&s;ty, and made an order that his &s;peech &s;hould be taken into con&s;ideration. After the throne had been declared vacant by a &s;mall majority of the peers, tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed that mea&s;ure had gradually withdrawn them&s;elves from the hou&s;e; &s;o that very few remained but &s;uch as were devoted to the new monarch. The&s;e therefore brought in a bill for pre|venting all di&s;putes concerning the pre&s;ent parliament. In the mean time, Mr. Hambden in the lower hou&s;e, put the que&s;tion, Whether a king elected by the lords &s;piritual and temporal, and the commons a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, com|ing to, and con&s;ulting with the &s;aid lords and commons, did not make as com|plete a parliament, and legi&s;lative power and authority, as if the &s;aid king &s;hould cau&s;e new elections to be made by writ? Many members affirmed, that the king's writ was as nece&s;&s;ary as his pre&s;ence to the being of a legal parliament; and as the convention was defective in this particular, it could not be ve&s;ted with a parlia|mentary authority by any management what&s;oever. The Whigs replied, That the e&s;&s;ence of a parliament con&s;i&s;ted in the meeting and co-operation of the king, lords, and commons; and that it was not material whether they were convoked by writ or by letter: they proved this a&s;&s;ertion by examples deduced from the hi&s;tory of England: they ob&s;erved, that a new election would be attended with great trouble, expence, and lo&s;s of time; and that &s;uch delay might prove fatal to the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Ireland, as well as to the allies on the continent. In the mid&s;t of this debate, the bill was brought down from the lords, and being read, a committee was appointed to make &s;ome amendments. The&s;e were no &s;ooner made than the commons &s;ent it back to the upper hou&s;e, and it imme|diately received the royal a&s;&s;ent. By this act the lords and commons a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter were declared the two hou&s;es of parliament, to all intents and purpo&s;es: it likewi&s;e ordained, That the pre&s;ent act and all other acts to which the royal a&s;&s;ent &s;hould be given before the next prorogation, &s;hould be under&s;tood and adjudged in law to begin on the thirteenth day of February: That the members, in&s;tead of the old oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy, &s;hould take the new oath incorporated in this act under the antient penalty; and, That the pre&s;ent parliament &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved in the u&s;ual manner. Immediately after this tran&s;action, a warm debate aro&s;e in the hou&s;e of commons about the re|venue which the courtiers alledged had devolved with the crown upon Wil|liam, at lea&s;t, during the life of James; for which term the greater part of it had been granted. Tho&s;e in the oppo&s;ition affirmed, that tho&s;e grants were vacated with the throne; and at length it was voted, That the revenue had expired. Then a motion was made, That a revenue &s;hould be &s;ettled on the king and queen; and the hou&s;e re&s;olved it &s;hould be taken into con&s;ideration. While they deliberated on this affair, they received a me&s;&s;age from his maje&s;ty, importing, that the late king had &s;et &s;ail from Bre&s;t with an armament to invade Ireland. They forthwith re&s;olved to a&s;&s;i&s;t his maje&s;ty with their lives and for|tunes; they voted a temporary aid of four hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds, to be levied by monthly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment; and both hou&s;es waited on the king, to &s;ig|nify this re&s;olution. But this unanimity did not take place, until &s;everal lords &s;piritual as well as temporal, had, rather than take the oaths, ab&s;ented them|&s;elves from parliament. The nonjuring prelates were Sancroft, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; Turner, bi&s;hop of Ely; Lake, of Chiche&s;ter; Ken, of Bath and
<PB N="$" REF="90">
Wells; White, of Peterborough; Loyd, of Norwich; Thomas, of Worce&s;ter; and Frampton, of Glouce&s;ter. The temporal peers who refu&s;ed the oath, were the duke of Newca&s;tle, the earls of Clarendon, Litchfield, Exeter, Yarmouth, and Stafford; the lords Griffin and Stawel. Five of the bi&s;hops withdrew them&s;elves from the hou&s;e at one time; but, before they retired, one of the number moved for a bill of toleration, and another of comprehen&s;ion, by which moderate di&s;&s;enters might be reconciled to the church, and admitted into eccle|&s;ia$tical benefices. Such bills were actua$ly prepared and pre&s;ented by the earl of Nottingham, who received the thanks of the hou&s;e for the pains he had taken. From this period, the party aver&s;e to the government of William were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of Nonjurors. They rejected the notion of a king de facto, as well as all other di&s;tinctions and limitations; and declared for the ab&s;olute power, and divine hereditary indefea&s;ible right of &s;overeigns.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>This faction had already begun to practi&s;e again&s;t the new government. The king having received &s;ome intimation of their de&s;igns, from intercepted letters, ordered the earl of Arran, Sir Robert Hamilton, and &s;ome other gen|tlemen of the Scotti&s;h nation to be apprehended, and &s;ent pri&s;oners to the Tower. Then he informed the two hou&s;es of the &s;tep he had taken, and even craved their advice with regard to his conduct in &s;uch a delicate affair, which had com|pelled him to tre&s;pa&s;s upon the law of England. The lords thanked him for the care he took of their liberties, and de&s;ired he would &s;ecure all di&s;turbers of the peace; but, the commons impowered him by a bill to di&s;pen&s;e with the Habeas corpus act, till the &s;eventeenth day of April next en&s;uing. This was a &s;tretch of confidence in the crown which had not been made in favour of the late king, even while Argyle and Monmouth were in open rebellion A &s;pirit of di&s;content had by this time diffu&s;&s;ed it&s;elf through the army, and become &s;o formidable to the court, that the king re&s;olved to retain the Dutch troops in England, and &s;end over to Holland in their room &s;uch regiments as were mo&s;t tinctured with di&s;affection. Of the&s;e the Scotti&s;h regiment of Dumbarton, com|manded by marechal Schomberg, mutinied on its march to Ip&s;wich, &s;eized the military che&s;t, di&s;armed the officers who oppo&s;ed their de&s;ign, declared for king James, and with four pieces of cannon, began their march for Scotland. Wil|liam being informed of this revolt, ordered general Ginkle to pur&s;ue them with three regiments of Dutch dragoons; and the mutineers &s;urrendered at di&s;cre|tion. As the delinquents were natives of Scotland, which had not yet &s;ubmit|ted in form to the new government, the king did not think proper to puni&s;h them as rebels, but ordered them to proceed for Holland, according to his fir&s;t intention. Though this attempt proved abortive, it made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon the mini&s;try, who were divided among them&s;elves, and wavered in their principles. However, they &s;eized this opportunity to bring in a bill for puni&s;hing mutiny and de&s;er$ion, which in a little time pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>

king's de&s;ire, in the room of the metropolitan, who was a malecontent; and next day the commons, in a body, waited on the king and queen at Whitehall, with an addre&s;s of congratulation. William, with a view to conciliate the af|fection of his new &s;ubjects, and check the progre&s;s of clamour and di&s;content, &s;ignified, in a &s;olemn me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e of commons, his readine&s;s to acquie&s;ce in any mea&s;ure they &s;hould think proper to take for a new regulation or total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the hearth-money, which he under&s;tood was a grievous impo&s;ition on the &s;ubjects; and this tax was afterwards aboli&s;hed. He was gratified with an addre&s;s of thanks, couched in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of duty, gratitude, and affection, declaring they would take &s;uch mea&s;ures in &s;upport of his crown as would convince the world that he reigned in the hearts of his people.</P>

<P>He had, in his an&s;wer to their former addre&s;s, a&s;&s;ured them of his con|&s;tant regard to the rights and pro&s;perity of the nation: he had explained the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of the Dutch, expatiated upon the zeal of that republic for the intere&s;ts of Britain, and the maintenance of the prote&s;tant religion; expre&s;&s;ed his hope that the Engli&s;h parliament would not only repay the &s;ums they had expended in his expedition; but, likewi&s;e farther &s;upport them to the utmo&s;t of their ability again&s;t the common enemies of their liberties and religion. He had ob&s;erved that a con&s;iderable army and fleet would be nece&s;&s;ary for the reduction of Ireland, and the protection of Britain; and he de&s;ired they would &s;ettle the revenue in &s;uch a manner, that it might be collected without difficulty and di&s;|pute. The &s;um total of the money expended by the &s;tates-general in William's expedition, amounted to &s;even millions of guilders, and the commons granted &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds for the di&s;charge of this debt, incurred for the pre|&s;ervation of their rights and religion. They voted funds for rai&s;ing and main|taining an army of two and twenty thou&s;and men, as well as for equipping a nu|merous fleet; but, they provided for no more than half a year's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the troops, hoping the reduction of Ireland might be fini&s;hed in that term; and this in&s;tance of frugality the king con&s;idered as a mark of their diffidence of his admini&s;tration. The Whigs were re&s;olved to &s;upply him gradually, that he might be the more dependent upon their zeal and attachment; but, he was not at all plea&s;ed with their precaution.</P>

<P>William was naturally bia&s;&s;ed to calvini&s;m, and aver&s;e to per&s;ecution. Whatever promi&s;es he had made, and whatever &s;entiments of re&s;pect he enter|tained for the church of England, he &s;eemed now in a great mea&s;ure alienated from it, by the oppo&s;ition he had met with from its members, particularly from the bi&s;hops who had thwarted his mea&s;ures; who had, by ab&s;enting them&s;elves from parliament, and refu&s;ing the oath, plainly di&s;owned his title, and renounced his government. He therefore re&s;olved to mortify the church, and gratify his own friends at the &s;ame time, by removing the ob&s;tacles affixed to nonconformity, that all prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters &s;hould be rendered capable of enjoying and exerci&s;ing

civil employments. When he gave his a&s;&s;ent to the bill for &s;u&s;pending the Habeas corpus act, he recommended the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new oath in lieu of tho&s;e of allegiance and &s;upremacy: he expre&s;&s;ed his hope that they would leave room for the admi&s;&s;ion of all his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects who &s;hould be found quali|fied for the &s;ervice: he &s;aid, &s;uch a conjunction would unite them the more firmly among them&s;elves, and &s;trengthen them again&s;t their common adver&s;a|$$es. In con&s;equence of this hint, a clau&s;e was in&s;erted in the bill for abrogat|ing the old and appointing the new oaths, by which the &s;acramental te&s;t was de|clared unnece&s;&s;ary in rendering any per&s;on capable of enjoying any office or em|ployment. It was, however, rejected by a great majority in the hou&s;e of lords. Another clau&s;e for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, though in different terms, was propo&s;ed by the king's direction, and met with the &s;ame fate, though in both ca&s;es &s;everal noblemen entered a prote&s;t again&s;t the re&s;olution of the hou&s;e. The&s;e fruitle&s;s efforts in favour of di&s;&s;enters, augmented the prejudice of the church|men again&s;t king William, who would have willingly compromi&s;ed the diffe|rence, by excu&s;ing the clergy from the oaths, provided the di&s;&s;enters might be exempted from the &s;acramental te&s;t; but, this was deemed the chief bulwark of the church, and therefore the propo&s;al was rejected. The church-party in the hou&s;e of lords moved, that in&s;tead of in&s;erting a clau&s;e, obliging the clergy to take the oaths, the king &s;hould be impowered to tender them; and in ca&s;e of their refu&s;al, they &s;hould incur the penalty, becau&s;e deprivation or the appre|hen&s;ions of it, might make them de&s;perate, and excite them to form de&s;igns again&s;t the government. This argument had no weight with the commons, who thought it was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to exact the oaths of the clergy, as their example influenced the kingdom in general, and the youth of the nation were formed under their in&s;tructions. After a long and warm debate, all the miti|gation that could be obtained, was a clau&s;e to impower the king to indulge any twelve clergymen deprived by virtue of this act, with a third part of their benefices during plea&s;ure. Thus the antient oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy were abrogated; the declaration of non-re&s;i&s;tance in the act of uniformity, was repealed: the new oath of allegiance was reduced to its primitive &s;implicity; and the coronation-oath rendered more explicit. The clergy were injoined to take the new oaths before the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, on pain of being &s;u&s;pended from their office for &s;ix months, and of intire deprivation, in ca&s;e they &s;hould not take them before the expiration of this term. They generally complied, though with &s;uch re&s;ervations and di&s;tinctions as were not much for the honour of their &s;incerity.</P>

<P>The king, though baffled in his de&s;ign again&s;t the &s;acramental te&s;t, re&s;olved to indulge the di&s;&s;enters with a toleration; and a bill for this purpo&s;e being prepared by the earl of Nottingham, was, after &s;ome debate, pa&s;&s;ed into a law, under the title of, An act for exempting their maje&s;ties prote&s;tant &s;ubjects di&s;&s;enting from the church of England, from the penalties of certain laws. It enacted$ That none of the penal laws &s;hould be con&s;trued to extend to tho&s;e di&s;|&s;enters who &s;hould take the oaths to the pre&s;ent government, and &s;ub&s;cribe the declaration of the thirtieth year in the reign of Charles II. provided, that they &s;hould hold no private a&s;&s;emblies or conventicles with the doors &s;hut; and that nothing &s;hould be con&s;trued to exempt them from the payment of tythes or other parochial duties: That, in ca&s;e of being cho&s;en in the offices of con&s;table,
<PB N="9" REF="120">
church-warden, over&s;eer, &amp;c. and of &s;crupling to take the oaths annexed to &s;uch offices, they &s;hould be allowed to execute the employment by deputy: That the preachers and teachers in congregations of di&s;&s;enting prote&s;tants, who &s;hall take the oaths, &s;ub&s;cribe the declaration, together with all the articles of religion, except the thirty-fourth and the two &s;ucceeding articles, and part of the twen|tieth, &s;hould be exempted from the penalties decreed again&s;t nonconformi&s;ts, as well as from &s;erving upon juries, or acting in pari&s;h-offices: yet all ju&s;tices of the peace were impowered to require &s;uch di&s;&s;enters to &s;ub&s;cribe the declara|tion, and take the oaths; and in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, to commit them to pri&s;on, with|out bail or mainprize. The &s;ame indulgence was extended to anabapti&s;ts, and even to quakers, on their &s;olemn promi&s;e, before God, to be faithful to the king and queen, and their a&s;&s;enting by profe&s;&s;ion and a&s;&s;everation to tho&s;e articles which the others ratified upon oath: they were likewi&s;e required to profe&s;s their belief in the Trinity and the Holy Scriptures. Even the papi&s;ts felt the benign influence of William's moderation in &s;piritual matters: he rejected the propo&s;als of &s;ome zealots, who exhorted him to enact &s;evere laws again&s;t popi&s;h recu&s;ants. Such a mea&s;ure, he ob&s;erved, would alienate all the papi&s;ts of Eu|rope from the intere&s;ts of England, and might produce a new catholic league, which would render the war a religious quarrel; be&s;ides, he could not pretend to &s;creen the prote&s;tants of Germany and Hungary, while he him&s;elf &s;hould per&s;ecute the catholics of England. He therefore re&s;olved to treat them with lenity; and though they were not comprehended in the act, they enjoyed the be|nefit of the toleration.</P>

<P>We have ob&s;erved, that in con&s;equence of the motion made by the bi|&s;hops when they withdrew from parliament, a bill was brought into the hou&s;e of lords, for uniting their maje&s;ties prote&s;tant &s;ubjects. This was extremely agree|able to the king, who had the &s;cheme of comprehen&s;ion very much at heart. In the progre&s;s of the bill a warm debate aro&s;e about the po&s;ture of kneeling at the &s;acrament, which was given up in favour of the di&s;&s;enters. Another, no le&s;s violent, en&s;ued upon the &s;ub&s;equent que&s;tion, <Q>&startq;Whether there &s;hould be an addition of laity in the commi&s;&s;ion to be given by the king to the bi&s;hops and others of the clergy, for preparing &s;uch a reformation of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs as might be the means of healing divi&s;ions, and correcting whatever might be crroneous or defective in the con&s;titution?&endq;</Q> A great number of the temporal lords in&s;i&s;ted warmly on this addition, and when it was rejected, four peers en|tered a formal prote&s;t. Bi&s;hop Burnet was a warm &s;tickler for the exclu&s;ion of the laity; and, in all probability, manife&s;ted this warmth in hope of ingratiating him&s;elf with his brethren, among whom his character was very far from being popular. But, the merit of this &s;acrifice was de&s;troyed by the arguments he had u&s;ed for di&s;pen&s;ing with the po&s;ture of kneeling at the &s;acrament; and by his propo&s;$ing in another provi&s;o of the bill, that the &s;ub&s;cribers, in&s;tead of expre&s;&s;ing a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent, &s;hould only &s;ubmit, with a promi&s;e of conformity.</P>

<P>The bill was with difficulty pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of lords: but the commons treated it with neglect. By this time a great number of malecontent members, who had retired from parliament, were returned, with a view to thwart the admini&s;tration, though they could not prevent the &s;ettlement. In|&s;tead of proceeding with the bill, they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, thank|ing him for his gracious declaration, and repeated a&s;&s;urances, that he would
<PB N="10" REF="130">
maintain the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; a church who&s;e doctrine and practice had evinced its loyalty beyond all contradiction. They likewi&s;e humbly be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to i&s;&s;ue writs for calling a convocation of the clergy, to be con&s;ulted in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, according to the antient u&s;age of parliaments; and they declared they would forthwith take into con&s;idera|tion, proper methods for giving ea&s;e to prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters. Though the king was di&s;plea&s;ed at this addre&s;s, in which the lords al&s;o had concurred, he returned a civil an&s;wer, by the mouth of the earl of Nottingham, profe&s;&s;ing his regard for the church of England, which &s;hould always be his peculiar care; recommending the di&s;&s;enters to their protection, and promi&s;ing to &s;ummon a convocation as &s;oon as &s;uch a mea&s;ure &s;hould be convenient. This me&s;&s;age produced no effect in favour of the bill, which lay neglected on the table. Tho&s;e who moved for it had no other view than that of di&s;playing their mo|deration; and now they excited their friends to oppo&s;e it with all their in|tere&s;t. Others were afraid of e&s;pou&s;ing it, le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;tigmatized as enemies to the church; and a great number of the mo&s;t eminent pre&s;oyterians were aver&s;e to a &s;cheme of comprehen&s;ion, which would dimini&s;h their &s;trength, and weaken the importance of the party. Being therefore violently oppo&s;ed on one hand, and but faintly &s;upported on the other, no wonder it mi&s;carried. The king, however, was &s;o bent upon the execution of his de&s;ign, that it was next &s;e&s;&s;ion revived in another form, though with no better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>The next object that engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the parliament, was the &s;ettlement of a reveneu for the &s;upport of the government. Hitherto there had been no di&s;tinction of what was allotted for the king's u&s;e, and what was a&s;&s;igned for the &s;ervice of the public; &s;o that the &s;overeign was intirely ma&s;ter of the whole &s;upply. As the revenue in the late reigns had been often embezzled and mi&s;applied, it was now re&s;olved that a certain &s;um &s;hould be &s;et apart for the maintenance of the king's hou&s;hold, and the &s;upport of his dignity; and that the re&s;t of the public money &s;hould be employed under the in&s;pection of parliament. Accordingly, &s;ince this period, the commons have appropriated the yearly &s;upplies to certain &s;pecified &s;ervices; and an account of the application has been con&s;tantly &s;ubmitted to both hou&s;es at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion. At this juncture, the prevailing party, or the Whigs, determined that the revenue &s;hould be granted from year to year, or at lea&s;t for a &s;mall term of years, that the king might find him&s;elf dependent upon the parliament, and merit a re|newal of the grant by a ju&s;t and popular admini&s;tration. In pur&s;uance of this maxim, when the revenue fell under con&s;ideration, they, on pretence of charges and anticipations, which they had not time to examine, granted it by a provi&s;ional act for one year only. The civil li&s;t was &s;ettled at &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, chargeable with the appointments of the queen dowager, the prince and prince&s;s of Denmark, the judges, and marechal Schomberg, to whom the parliament had already granted one hundred thou&s;and pounds, in con&s;ideration of his important &s;ervices to the nation. The commons al&s;o voted, that a con&s;tant revenue of twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds, &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;upport of the crown in time of peace.</P>

<P>The king took umbrage at the&s;e re&s;traints laid upon the application of the public money, which were the mo&s;t &s;alutary fruits of the revolution. He con&s;idered them as marks of diffidence, by which he was di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="11" REF="140">
from his predece&s;&s;ors; and thought them an ungrateful return for the &s;ervices he had done the nation. The Tories perceived his di&s;gu&s;t, and did not fail to foment his jealou&s;y again&s;t their adver&s;aries, which was confirmed by a fre&s;h effort of the Whigs, in relation to a militia. A bill was brought into the hou&s;e, for regulating it in &s;uch a manner as would have rendered it in a great mea&s;ure independent both of the king and the lords lieutenants of counties. The&s;e being generally peers, &s;uffered the bill to lie neglected on the table; but the attempt confirmed the &s;u&s;picion of the king, who began to think him|&s;elf in danger of being en&s;laved by a republican party. The Tories had, by the canal of Nottingham, made proffers of &s;ervice to his maje&s;ty; but com|plained, at the &s;ame time, that as they were in danger of being pro&s;ecuted for their lives and fortunes, they could not, without an act of indemnity, exert them&s;elves in favour of the crown, le&s;t they &s;hould incur a per&s;ecution from their implacable enemies.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">

<P>The&s;e remon&s;trances made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ion on the king, that he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e by Mr. Hambden, recommending a bill of indemnity as the mo&s;t effectual means for putting an end to all controver&s;ies, di&s;tinctions, and occa&s;ions of di&s;cord. He de&s;ired it might be prepared with all convenient expedition, and with &s;uch exceptions only as &s;hould &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary for the vin|dication of public ju&s;tice, the &s;afety of him and his con&s;ort, and the &s;ettlement and welfare of the nation. An addre&s;s of thanks to his maje&s;ty was unanimou&s;ly voted. Neverthele&s;s, his de&s;ign was fru&s;trated by the backwardne&s;s of the Whigs, who proceeded &s;o &s;lowly in the bill, that it could not be brought to maturity before the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. They wanted to keep the &s;courge over the heads of their enemies, until they &s;hould find a proper opportunity for re|venge; and, in the mean time, re&s;train them from oppo&s;ition, by the terror of impending vengeance. They affected to in&s;inuate that the king's de&s;ign was to rai&s;e the prerogative as high as it had been in the preceding reigns; and for that purpo&s;e he pre&s;&s;ed an act of indemnity, by virtue of which he might legally u&s;e the in&s;truments of the late tyranny. The earls of Mon|mouth and Warrington indu&s;triou&s;ly infu&s;ed the&s;e jealou&s;ies into the minds of their party; while, on the other hand, the earl of Nottingham inflamed Wil|liam's di&s;tru&s;t of his old friends; and both &s;ides &s;ucceeded in kindling an ani|mo&s;ity, which had like to have produced confu&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding the en|deavours u&s;ed by the earls of Shrew&s;bury and Devon&s;hire to allay tho&s;e heats, and remove the &s;u&s;picion that mutually prevailed.</P>

<P>It was now judged expedient to pa&s;s an act for &s;ettling the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the crown, according to the former re&s;olution of the convention. A bill for this purpo&s;e was brought into the lower hou&s;e, with a clau&s;e di&s;|abling papi&s;ts from &s;ucceeding to the crown: to this the lords added, "Or &s;uch as &s;hould marry papi&s;ts," ab&s;olving the &s;ubject in that ca&s;e from allegiance. The bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, by the king's direction, propo&s;ed that the prince&s;s Sophia dutche&s;s of Hanover, and her po&s;terity, &s;hould be nominated in the act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as the next prote&s;tant heirs, failing i&s;&s;ue of the king, and Anne prince&s;s of Denmark. The&s;e amendments gave ri&s;e to warm debates in the lower hou&s;e, where they were vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, not only by tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well in &s;ecret to the late king and the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but likewi&s;e by the republican party, who hoped to &s;ee monarchy altogether extingui&s;hed in

At length the bill was dropped for the pre&s;ent, in con&s;equence of an event which in a great mea&s;ure di&s;&s;ipated the fears of a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or.

<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e dome&s;tic di&s;putes, William did not neglect the affairs of the continent. He retained all his former influence in Holland, as his countrymen had rea&s;on to confide in his repeated a&s;&s;urances of inviolable affection. The great &s;cheme which he had projected of a confederacy again&s;t French, began at this period to take effect. The princes of the empire a&s;|&s;embled in the diet, &s;olemnly exhorted the emperor to declare war again&s;t the French king, who had committed numberle&s;s infractions of the treaties of Mun&s;ter$ O&s;nabrug, Nimeguen, and the truce, invaded their country without provocation, and evinced him&s;elf an inveterate enemy of the holy Roman empire. They therefore be&s;ought his imperial maje&s;ty to conclude a treaty of peace with the Turks, who had offered advantageous terms, and come to an open rupture with Lewis; in which ca&s;e, they would con&s;ider it as a war of the empire, and &s;upport their head in the mo&s;t effectual manner. The &s;tates-general publi&s;hed a declaration again&s;t the common enemy, taxing him with manifold infractions of the treaty of commerce; with having involved the &s;ubjects of the republic in the per&s;ecution which he had rai&s;ed again&s;t the pro|te&s;tants; with having cajoled and in&s;ulted them with deceitful promi&s;es and in&s;olent threats; with having plundered and oppre&s;&s;ed the Dutch merchants and traders in France; and finally, with having declared war again&s;t the &s;tates, without any plau&s;ible rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned. The elector of Brandenburg denounced war again&s;t France, as a power who&s;e perfidy, cruelty, and ambition, it was the duty of every prince to oppo&s;e. The marquis de Ca&s;tanaga, governor of the Spani&s;h Netherlands, i&s;&s;ued a counter declaration to that of Lewis, who had declared again&s;t his ma&s;ter. He accu&s;ed the French king of having laid wa&s;te the empire, without any regard to the obligations of religion and hu|manity, or even to the laws of war; of having countenanced the mo&s;t bar|barous acts of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion; and of having intrigued with the ene|mies of Chri&s;t for the de&s;truction of the empire. The emperor negotiated an alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, with the &s;tates-general, binding the contrac|ting parties to co-operate with their whole power again&s;t France and her allies. It was &s;tipulated, that neither &s;ide &s;hould engage in a &s;eparate treaty, on any pretence what&s;oever: that no peace &s;hould be admitted, until the treaties of We&s;tphalia, O&s;nabrug, Mun&s;ter, and the Pyrenees, &s;hould have been vindi|cated: that in ca&s;e of a negotiation for a peace or truce, the tran&s;actions on both &s;ides &s;hould be communicated bona &s;ide; and that Spain and England &s;hould be invited to accede to the treaty. In a &s;eparate article, the contracting powers agreed, that in ca&s;e of the Spani&s;h king's dying without i&s;&s;ue, the &s;tates-general &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the emperor with all their forces to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that monarchy: That they &s;hould u&s;e their friendly endeavours with the princes electors their allies, towards elevating his &s;on Jo&s;eph to the dignity of king of

<P>William, who was the &s;oul of this confederacy, found no difficulty in per&s;uading the Engli&s;h to undertake a war again&s;t their old enemies and rivals. On the &s;ixteenth day of April, Mr. Hambden made a motion for taking into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the kingdom with re&s;pect to France, and foreign alliances; and the commons unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that in ca&s;e his maje&s;ty &s;hould think fit to engage in a war with France, they would, in a parliamentary way, enable him to carry it on with vigour. An addre&s;s was immediately drawn up, and pre&s;ented to the king, de&s;iring he would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the de&s;tructive methods taken of late years by the French king, again&s;t the trade, quiet, and intere&s;t of the nation, particularly his pre&s;ent inva&s;ion of Ireland, and &s;upporting the rebels in that kingdom. They did not doubt but the alliances already made with &s;uch as might hereafter be concluded by his maje&s;ty, would be &s;ufficient to reduce the French king to &s;uch a condition, that it &s;hould not be in his power to violate the peace of Chri&s;tendom; nor prejudice the trade and pro&s;perity of England: in the mean time they a&s;&s;ured his maje&s;ty he might depend upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his parliament, according to the vote which had pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of commons. This was a welcome addre&s;s to king William, who a&s;&s;ured them that no part of the &s;upplies which they might grant for the pro&s;ecution of the war, &s;hould be mi&s;applied; and, on the &s;eventh day of May, he declared war again&s;t the French monarch. On this occa&s;ion Lewis was charged with having ambitiou&s;ly invaded the ter|ritories of the emperor, and denounced war again&s;t the allies of England, in violation of the treaties confirmed under the guaranty of the Engli&s;h crown; with having encroached upon the fi&s;hery of Newfoundland, invaded the Ca|ribbee i&s;lands, taken forcible po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New York and Hud&s;on's bay, made depredations on the Engli&s;h at &s;ea, prohibited the importation of Engli&s;h ma|nufactures, di&s;puted the right of the flag, per&s;ecuted many Engli&s;h &s;ubjects on account of religion, contrary to expre&s;s treaties and the law of nations; and &s;ent an armament to Ireland, in &s;upport of the rebels in that kingdom.</P>

<P>Having thus de&s;cribed the progre&s;s of the revolution in England, we &s;hall now briefly explain the mea&s;ures that were pro&s;ecuted in Scotland, towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of William on the throne of that kingdom. The meeting of the Scotti&s;h convention was fixed for the fourteenth day of March; and both parties employed all their intere&s;t to influence the election of members. The duke of Hamilton, and all the pre&s;byterians, declared for William. The duke of Gordon maintained the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh for his old ma&s;ter; but, as he had neglected to lay in a &s;tore of provi&s;ions, he dep$nded entirely upon the citizens for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The parti&s;ans of James were headed by the earl of Balcarras, and Graham vi&s;count Dundee, who employed their endeavours to pre&s;erve union among the individuals of their party; to confirm the duke of Gordon, who began to waver in his attachment to their &s;overeign; and to manage their intrigues in &s;uch a manner as to derive &s;ome advantage to their cau&s;e from the tran&s;actions of the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion. When the lords and com|mons a&s;&s;embled at Edinburgh, the bi&s;hop of that dioce&s;e, who officiated as chaplain to the convention, prayed for the re&s;toration of king James. The fir&s;t di&s;pute turned upon the choice of a pre&s;ident. The friends of the late
<PB N="14" REF="170">
king &s;et up the marquis of Athol in oppo&s;ition to the duke of Hamilton; but this la&s;t was elected by a con&s;iderable majority; and a good number of the other party finding their cau&s;e the weake&s;t, de&s;erted it from that moment. The earls of Lothian and Tweedale were &s;ent as deputies, to require the duke of Gordon, in the name of the e&s;tates, to quit the ca&s;tle in four and twenty hours, and leave the charge of it to the prote&s;tant officer next in command. The duke, though in him&s;elf irre&s;olute, was animated by Dundee to demand &s;uch conditions as the convention would not grant. The negotiation proving ineffectual, the e&s;tates ordered the heralds, in all their formalities, to &s;ummon him to &s;urrender the ca&s;tle immediately, on pain of incurring the penalties of high trea&s;on; and he refu&s;ing to obey their mandate, was proclaimed a traitor. All per&s;ons were forbid, under the &s;ame penalties, to aid, &s;uccour, or cor|re&s;pond with him; and the ca&s;tle was blocked up by the troops of the city.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Next day an expre&s;s arrived from London, with a letter from king William to the &s;tates; and at the &s;ame time, another from James was pre&s;ented by one Crane an Engli&s;h dome&s;tic of the abdicated queen. William ob&s;erved that he had called a meeting of their e&s;tates, at the de&s;ire of the no|bility and gentry of Scotland a&s;&s;embled at London, who reque&s;ted that he would take upon him&s;elf the admini&s;tration of their affairs. He exhorted them to concert mea&s;ures for &s;ettling the peace of the kingdom upon a &s;olid foundation; and to lay a&s;ide animo&s;ities and factions, which &s;erved only to impede that &s;alutary &s;ettlement. He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;en&s;ible of the good effects that would ari&s;e from an union of the two kingdoms; and a&s;&s;ured them he would u&s;e his be&s;t endeavours to promote &s;uch a coalition. A committee being appointed to draw up a re&s;pectful an&s;wer to the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, a debate en&s;ued about the letter from the late king James, which they re&s;olved to fa|vour with a reading, after the member, &s;hould have &s;ub&s;cribed an act, de|claring, that notwith&s;tanding any thing that might be contained in the letter for di&s;&s;olving the convention or impeding their procedure, they were a free and lawful meeting of the &s;tates; and would continue undi&s;&s;olved, until they &s;hould have &s;ettled and &s;ecured the protestant religion, the government, laws, and liberties of the kingdom. Having taken this precaution, they proceeded to exa|mine the letter of their late &s;overeign, who conjured them to &s;upport his intere&s;t as faithful &s;ubjects, and eternize their names by a loyalty &s;uitable to their former profe&s;&s;ions. He &s;aid he would not fail to give them &s;uch &s;peedy and powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance as would enable them to defend them&s;elves from any foreign at|tempt; and even to a&s;&s;ert his right again&s;t tho&s;e enemies who had depre&s;&s;ed it by the blacke&s;t u&s;urpations and unnatural attempts, which the Almighty God would not allow to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed. He offered pardon to all tho&s;e who &s;hould return to their duty before the la&s;t day of the month; and threatened to puni&s;h rigorou&s;ly &s;uch as &s;hould &s;tand out in rebellion again&s;t him and his authority.</P>

<P>This addre&s;s produced very little effect in favour of the unfor|tunate exile, who&s;e friends were greatly outnumbered in this a&s;&s;embly. His me&s;&s;enger was ordered into cu&s;tody, and afterwards di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a pa&s;s in|&s;tead of an an&s;wer. James fore&s;eeing this contempt, had, by an in&s;trument dated in Ireland, authori&s;ed the archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, the earl of Balcarras, and the vi&s;count Dundee, to call a convention of the e&s;tates at Stirling. The&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="180">
three depended on the intere&s;t of the marquis of Athol and the earl of Mar, who profe&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t affection for the late king; and they hoped a &s;e|ce&s;&s;ion of their friends would embarra&s;s the convention, &s;o as to retard the &s;ettlement of king William. Their expectations, however, were di&s;appointed. Athol de&s;erted their cau&s;e; Mar &s;uffered him&s;elf to be intercepted in his re|treat; the re&s;t of their party were, by the vigilance of the duke of Hamilton, prevented from leaving the convention, except the vi&s;count of Dundee, who retreated to the mountains with about fifty hor&s;e, and was pur&s;ued by order of the e&s;tates. This de&s;ign being fru&s;trated, the convention approved and re|cognized, by a &s;olemn act, the conduct of the nobility and gentlemen who had intreated the king of England to take upon him the admini&s;tration. They acknowledged their obligation to the prince of Orange, who had pre|vented the de&s;truction of their laws, religion, and fundamental con&s;titution: they be&s;ought his highne&s;s to a&s;&s;ume the reins of government for that king|dom: they i&s;&s;ued a proclaration, requiring all per&s;ons, from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty, to be in readine&s;s to take arms when called upon for that purpo&s;e: they con|ferred the command of their hor&s;e-militia upon Sir Patrick Hume, who was attainted for having been concerned in Argyle's in&s;urrection: they levied eight hundred men for a guard to the city of Edinburgh, and con&s;tituted the earl of Leven their commander: they put the militia all over the kingdom into the hands of tho&s;e on whom they could rely: they created the earl of Mar governor of Stirling ca&s;tle: they received a reinforcement of five regiments from England, under the command of Mackay, whom they appointed their general; and they i&s;&s;ued orders for &s;ecuring all di&s;affected per&s;ons. Then they di&s;patched lord Ro&s;s, with an an&s;wer to king William's letter, profe&s;&s;ing their gratitude to their deliverer, congratulating him upon his &s;ucce&s;s, thanking him for a&s;&s;uming the admini&s;tration of their affairs, and a&s;&s;embling a conven|tion of their e&s;tates, declaring they would take effectual and &s;peedy mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the prote&s;tant religion, as well as for e&s;tabli&s;hing the government, laws, and liberties of the kingdom; a&s;&s;uring him they would, as much as lay in their power, avoid di&s;putes and animo&s;ities; and de&s;iring the con|tinuance of his maje&s;ty's care and protection.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XX.</HEAD>
<P>After the departure of lord Ro&s;s, they appointed a committee, con|&s;i&s;ting of eight lords, eight knights, and as many burge&s;&s;es, to prepare the plan of a new &s;ettlement: but this re&s;olution was not taken without a vigorous oppo&s;ition from &s;ome remaining adherents of the late king, headed by the arch|bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, all the other prelates, except he of Edinburgh, having already de&s;erted the convention. After warm debates, the committee agreed in the following vote. "The e&s;tates of the kingdom of Scotland find and de|clare, That king James VII. being a profe&s;&s;ed papi&s;t, did a&s;&s;ume the royal power, and act as a king, without ever taking the oath required by law; and had, by the advice of evil and wicked coun&s;ellors, invaded the fundamental con&s;titution of this kingdom, and altered it from a legal and limited mo|narchy, to an arbitrary de&s;potic power; and had governed the &s;ame to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the prote&s;tant religion, and violation of the laws and liberties of the nation, inverting all the ends of government; whereby he had forfaulted the right of the crown, and the throne was become vacant." When this vote was reported, the bi&s;hop of Edinburgh argued &s;trenuou&s;ly again&s;t it, as containing
<PB N="16" REF="190">
a charge of which the king was innocent; and he propo&s;ed that his maje&s;ty &s;hould be invited to return to his Scotti&s;h dominions. All his argu|ments were defeat$d or over-ruled; the hou&s;e confirmed the vote, which was immediately enacted into a law by a great majority. The lord pre&s;ident de|clared the throne $acant, and propo&s;ed that it might be filled with William and Mary, king and queen of England. The committee was ordered to pre|pare an act for &s;ettling the crown upon their maje&s;ties, together with an in|&s;trument of governm$nt for &s;ecuring the &s;ubjects from the grievan$s under which they laboured.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXI.</HEAD>
<P>On the eleventh day of April, this act, with the conditions of in|heritance, and the in&s;trument, were reported, con&s;idered, unanimou&s;ly ap|proved, and &s;olemnly p$oclaimed at the market-cro&s;s of Edinburgh, in pre|&s;ence of the lord pr$&s;ident, a&s;&s;$&s;ted by the lord provo&s;t and magi&s;tracy of the city, the duke of Queen&s;berry, the marqui&s;&s;$s of Ath$l and Douglas, to|gether with a great number of the nobility and gentry. At the &s;ame time they publ$&s;hed another proclamation, forbidding all per&s;ons to acknowledge, obey, a&s;&s;i&s;t, or corre&s;pond, with the late king James; or by word, writing, or &s;er|mon, to di&s;pute or di&s;own the royal authority of king William and queen Mary$ or to mi&s;con&s;true the proceedings of the e&s;tates, or create jealou&s;ies or mi&s;apprehen&s;ions with regard to the tran&s;actions of the government, on pain of incurring the mo&s;t &s;evere penalties. Then, having &s;ettled the coronation-oath$ they granted a commi&s;&s;ion to the earl of Argyle for the lords, Sir James Mont|gomery for the knights, and Sir John Dalrymple for the boroughs, impower|ing them to repair to London, and inve&s;t their maje&s;ties with the govern|ment. This affair being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the convention appointed a committee to take care of the public peace, and adjourned to the twenty-fir&s;t day of May. On the eleventh day of that month, the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners being introduced to their maje&s;ties at Whitehall, pre&s;ented fir&s;t a preparatory letter from the e&s;tates, then the in&s;trument of government, with a paper containing a recital of the grievances of the nation; and an addre&s;s, de&s;iring his maje&s;ty to con|vert the convention into a parliament. The king having graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed to concur with them in all ju&s;t mea&s;ures for the intere&s;t of the kingdom, the coronation-oath was tendered to their maje&s;ties by the earl of Argyle. As it contained a clau&s;e, importing, that they &s;hould root out here&s;y, the king declared, that he did not mean by the&s;e words, that he &s;hould be under an obligation to act as a per&s;ecutor: the commi&s;&s;ioners replying, that &s;uch was not the meaning or import of the oath, he de&s;ired them, and others pre&s;ent, to bear witne&s;s to the exception he had made.</P>

<DIV4 N="22" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXII.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean time, lord Dundee exerted him&s;elf with uncommon activity in behalf of his ma&s;ter. He had been &s;ummoned by a trumpet to re|turn to the convention; but refu&s;ed to obey the citation, on pretence tha the Whigs had made an attempt upon his life; and that the deliberations of the e&s;tates were influenced by the neighbourhood of Engli&s;h troops, under the command of Mackay. He was forthwith declared a fugitive, outlaw, and rebel. He was rancorou&s;ly hated by the prebyterians, on whom he had ex|erci&s;ed &s;ome cruelties, as an officer under the former government; and for this rea&s;on the &s;tates re&s;olved to inflict upon him exemplary puni&s;hment. Parties were detached in pur&s;uit of him and Balcarras. This la&s;t fell into their
<PB N="17" REF="200">
hands, and was committed to a common pri&s;on; but Dundee fought his way through the troops that &s;urrounded him, and e&s;caped to the Highlands, where he determined to take arms in favour of James, though that prince had forbid him to make any attempt of that nature, until he &s;hould receive a reinforce|ment from Ireland. While this officer was employed in a&s;&s;embling the clans of his party, king William appointed the duke of Hamilton commi&s;&s;ioner to the convention parliament. The po&s;t of &s;ecretary for Scotland was be&s;towed upon lord Melvil, a weak and &s;ervile nobleman, who had taken refuge in Holland from the violences of the late reigns; but the king depended chiefly for advice upon Dalrymple lord Stair, pre&s;ident of the college of ju&s;tice$ an old crafty fanatic, who for fifty years had complied in all things with all go|vernments. Though the&s;e were rigid pre&s;byterians, the king, to humour the oppo&s;ite party, admitted &s;ome individuals of the epi&s;copal nobility to the council-board; and this intermixture, in&s;tead of allaying animo&s;ities, &s;erved only to &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;cord and confu&s;ion. The Scotti&s;h convention, in their detail of grievances, enumerated the lords of the articles; the act of parliament in the reign of Charles II. by which the king's &s;upremacy was rai&s;ed &s;o high that he could pre&s;cribe any mode of religion according to his plea&s;ure; and the &s;uperiority of any office in the church, above that of pre&s;by|ters. The king, in his in&s;tructions to the lord commi&s;&s;ioner, con&s;ented to a regulation of the lords of the articles, though he would not allow the in&s;titu|tion to be abrogated: he was contented that the act relating to the king's &s;u|premacy &s;hould be re&s;cinded; and that the church-government &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;uch a manner as would be mo&s;t agreeable to the inclinations of the people.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="23" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>On the &s;eventeenth day of June, duke Hamilton opened the Scotti&s;h parliament, after the convention had a&s;&s;umed this name, in con&s;e|quence of an act pa&s;&s;ed by his maje&s;ty's direction: but the members in ge|neral were extremely chagrined when they found the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;o much re&s;tricted in the affair of the lords of the articles, which they con&s;idered as their chief grievance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lords of the articles, by the gradual $&s;urpation of the crown, actually con&s;tituted a griev$nce intolerable in a free nation. The king impowered the commi&s;&s;ioner to chu&s;e eight bi|&s;hops, whom he a$thori&s;ed to nominate eight noblemen: the&s;e together cho&s;e eight barons, and eight burge&s;&s;es; and this whole number, in co$junction with the officers of &s;tate as &s;upernu|meraries, con&s;tituted the lords of the articles. This committee po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ole excl$&s;ive right and liberty of bringing in motions, making overtures for redre&s;&s;ing wrongs, and propo&s;ing means and expedients for the relief, &s;afety, and benefit of the &s;ubjects. Proceedings of the Scots parliament vindicated.</NOTE>. The king permitted that the e&s;tates &s;hould chu&s;e the lords by their own &s;uffrages; and that they &s;hould be at liberty to recon&s;ider any &s;ubject which the &s;aid lords might reject. He afterwards indulged the three e&s;tates with the choice of eleven delegates each, for this committee, to be elected monthly, or oftener, if they &s;hould think fit; but even the&s;e con|ce&s;$ions proved un&s;atisfactory, while the in&s;titution it&s;elf remained. Their di&s;contents were not even appea&s;ed by the pa&s;&s;ing of an act, aboli&s;hing prelacy. Indeed their re&s;entment was inflamed by another con&s;ideration; namely, that of the king's having given &s;eats in the council to &s;ome individuals attached to the hierarchy. They manife&s;ted their &s;entiments on this &s;ubject by bringing in a bill, excluding from any public tru&s;t, place, or employment, under their maje&s;ties,
<PB N="18" REF="210">
all &s;uch as had been concerned in the encroachments of the late reign, or had di&s;covered di&s;affection to the late happy change; or in any way re|tarded or ob&s;tructed the de&s;igns of the convention. This mea&s;ure was pro|&s;ecuted with great warmth; and the bill pa&s;&s;ed through all the forms of the hou&s;e, but proved ineffectual for want of the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="24" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>Nor were they le&s;s ob&s;tinate in the affair of the judges, whom the king had ventured to appoint by virtue of his own prerogative. The male|contents brought in a bill, declaring the bench vacant as it was at the re&s;tora|tion; a&s;&s;erting their own right to examine and approve tho&s;e who &s;hould be ap+pointed to fill it: providing, that if in time to come, any &s;uch total vacancy &s;hould occur, the nomination &s;hould be in the king, or queen, or regent for the time being, and the parliament retain the right of approbation; and that all the clau&s;es in the &s;everal acts relating to the admi&s;&s;ion of the ordinary lords of &s;e&s;|&s;ion, and their qualifications for that office &s;hould be ratified and confirmed for perpetual ob&s;ervation. Such was the intere&s;t of this party, that the bill was carried by a great majority, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of the mini&s;ters, who re&s;olved to maintain the king's nomination even in defiance of a parlia|mentary re&s;olution. The majority, exa&s;perated at this open violation of their privileges, forbad the judges whom the king had appointed, to open their com|mi&s;&s;ions, or hold a &s;e&s;&s;ion until his maje&s;ty's further plea&s;ure &s;hould be known: on the other hand, they were compelled to act by the menaces of the privy|council. The di&s;pute was carried on with great acrimony on both &s;ides, and produced &s;uch a ferment, that before the &s;e&s;&s;ion opened, the mini&s;try thought proper to draw a great number of forces into the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, to &s;upport the judges in the exerci&s;e of their functions.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXV.</HEAD>
<P>The lord-commi&s;&s;ioner, alarmed at this &s;cene of tumult and confu|&s;ion, adjourned the hou&s;e till the eighth day of October; a &s;tep, which added to the other unpopular mea&s;ures of the court, incen&s;ed the oppo&s;ition to &s;uch a degree, that they drew up a remon&s;trance to the king, complaining of this ad|journment while the nation was yet un&s;ettled, recapitulating the &s;everal in|&s;tances in which they had expre&s;&s;ed their zeal and affection for his maje&s;ty; explaining their rea&s;ons for di&s;&s;enting from the mini&s;try in &s;ome articles; be&s;eech|ing him to con&s;ider what they had repre&s;ented; to give his royal a&s;&s;ent to the acts of parliament which they had prepared, and take mea&s;ures for redre&s;&s;ing all the other grievances of the nation. This addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the king at Hampton-court, and he was &s;o touched with the reproaches it implied, as if he had not fulfilled the conditions on which he accepted the crown of Scotland, that he, in his own vindication, publi&s;hed his in&s;tructions to the commi&s;&s;ioner; and by the&s;e it appeared, that the duke might have proceeded to greater lengths in obliging his countrymen. Before the adjournment, however, the parliament had granted the revenue for life; and rai&s;ed money for maintaining a body of forces, as well as for &s;upporting the incidental expence of the government for &s;ome months: yet part of the troops in that kingdom were &s;upplied and &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted by the admini&s;tration of England. In con&s;equence of the&s;e di&s;putes in the Scotti&s;h parliament, their church was left without any &s;ettled form of govern|ment; for, though the hierarchy was aboli&s;hed, the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline was not yet e&s;tabli&s;hed, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs were occa&s;ionally regulated by the
<PB N="19" REF="220">
privy-council, deriving its authority from that very act of &s;upremacy, which, according to the claim of rights, ought to have been repealed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion was no &s;ooner adjourned, than Sir John Lanier con|verted the blockade of Edinburgh-ca&s;tle into a regular &s;iege, which was pro&s;e|cuted with &s;uch vigour, that in a little time the fortifications were ruined, and the works advanced to the foot of the walls, in which the be&s;iegers had made &s;everal large breaches. The duke of Gordon finding his ammunition expended, his defences de&s;troyed, his intelligence intirely cut off, and de&s;pairing of relief from the adherents of his ma&s;ter, de&s;ired to capitulate, and obtained very fa|vourable terms for his garri&s;on; but, he would not &s;tipulate any conditions for him&s;elf, declaring, that he had &s;o much re&s;pect for all the princes de&s;cended from king James VI. that he would not affront any of them &s;o far as to in&s;i&s;t upon terms for his own particular; he therefore, on the thirteenth day of June, &s;ur|rendered the ca&s;tle and him&s;elf at di&s;cretion. All the hopes of James and his party were now concentred in the vi&s;count of Dundee, who had a&s;&s;embled a body of Highlanders, and re&s;olved to attack Mackay, on an a&s;&s;urance he had re|ceived by me&s;&s;age, that the regiment of Scotti&s;h dragoons would de&s;ert that officer, and join him in the action. Mackay having received intimation of this de&s;ign, decamped immediately, and by long marches retired before Dundee, until he was reinforced by Ram&s;ey's dragoons, and another regiment of Eng|li&s;h infantry; then he faced about, and Dundee in his turn retreated into Lochaber. Lord Murray, &s;on of the marquis of Athole, a&s;&s;embled his va&s;&s;als to the number of twelve hundred men for the &s;ervice of the regency; but, he was betrayed by one of his own dependants, who &s;eized the ca&s;tle of Blair for Dundee, and prevailed upon the Athol men to di&s;per&s;e rather than fight again&s;t James their lawful &s;overeign.</P>

<P>The vi&s;count was by this time reduced to great difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s. His men had not for many weeks ta&s;ted bread or &s;alt, or any drink but water: In&s;tead of five hundred infantry, three hundred hor&s;e, with a &s;upply of arms, ammunition, and provi&s;ion, which James had promi&s;ed to &s;end from Ireland, he received a reinforcement of three hundred naked recruits; but, the tran&s;ports with the &s;tores fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h. Though this was a mortifying di&s;appointment, he bore it without repining; and, far from aban|doning him&s;elf to de&s;pair, began his march to the ca&s;tle of Blair, which was threatened with a &s;iege by general Mackay. When he reached this fortre&s;s, he received intelligence that the enemy had entered the pa&s;s of Killycrankie, and re&s;olved to give them battle without delay. He accordingly advanced again&s;t them; and a furious engagement en&s;ued, though it was not of long duration. The Highlanders having received and returned the fire of the Engli&s;h, fell in among them &s;word in hand with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the foot were utterly broke in &s;even minutes. The dragoons fled at the fir&s;t charge in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation: Dundee's hor&s;e, not exceeding one hundred, broke through Mackay's own regiment: the earl of Dumbarton, at the head of a few volun|teers made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the artillery: twelve hundred of Mackay's forces were killed on the &s;pot, five hundred taken pri&s;oners, and the re&s;t fled with great precipitation for &s;ome hours, until they were rallied by their general, who was an officer of approved courage, conduct, and experience. Nothing could be more complete or deci&s;ive than the victory which the Highlanders obtained;
<PB N="20" REF="230">
yet it was dearly purcha&s;ed with the death of their beloved chieftain the vi&s;count of Dundee, who fell by a random-&s;hot in the engagement, and his fate pro|duced &s;uch confu&s;ion in his army as prevented all pur&s;uit. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an en|terpri&s;ing &s;pirit, undaunted courage, inviolable fidelity, and was peculiarly qualified to command the people who fought under his banner. He was the life and &s;oul of that cau&s;e which he e&s;pou&s;ed; and after his death it daily de|clined into ruin and d$&s;grace. He was &s;ucceeded in command by colonel Can|non, who landed the re$nforcement from Ireland; but, all his de&s;igns mi&s;car|ried: &s;o that the clans, wearied with repeated misfortunes, laid down their arms by degrees, and took the benefit of a pardon, which king William offered to tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;ubmit within the time &s;pecified in his proclamation.</P>

<P>After this &s;ketch of Scotti&s;h affairs, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a retro&s;pective view of James, and relate the parti$ulars of his expedition to Ire|land. That unfortunate prince and his queen were received with the mo&s;t cor|dial ho&s;putality by the French monarch, who a&s;&s;igned the ca&s;tle of St. Germain for the place of their re&s;idence, &s;upported their hou&s;hold with great magnificence, enriched them with pre&s;ents, and undertook to re-e&s;tabli&s;h them on the throne of England. James, however, conducted him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as conveyed no favourable idea of his &s;pirit and under&s;tanding. He &s;eemed to have been ema&s;culated by religion$ he was de&s;erted by that courage and magnanimity for which his youth had been di&s;tingui&s;hed. He did not di&s;cover great &s;en&s;ibility at the lo&s;s of his kingdom. All his faculties were &s;wallowed up in bigotry. In&s;tead of contriving plans for retrieving his crown, he held conferences with the je&s;uits on topics of religion. The pity which his misfortunes excited in Lewis was mingled with contempt. The pope &s;upplied him with indulgences, while the Romans laughed at him in pa&s;quinades; <Q>&startq;There is a pious man, &s;aid the archbi&s;hop of Rheims, (ironically) who has &s;acrificed three crowns for a ma&s;s.&endq;</Q> In a word, he &s;ubjected him&s;elf to the ridicule and raillery of the French nation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>All the hope of rea&s;cending the Briti&s;h throne depended upon his friends in Scotland and Ireland. Tyrconnel, who commanded in this la&s;t king|dom was confirmed in his attachment to James, by the per&s;ua&s;ions of Hamilton, who had undertaken for his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the prince of Orange. Neverthele&s;s, he di&s;gui&s;ed his &s;entiments, and temporized with William, until James &s;hould be able to &s;upply him with reinforcements from France, which he earne&s;tly &s;o|licited by private me&s;&s;ages. In the mean time, with a view to cajole the prote&s;|tants of Ireland, and amu&s;e king William with hope of his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he per|&s;uaded the lord Mountjoy, in whom the prote&s;tants chiefly confided, and baron Rice, to go in per&s;on with a commi&s;&s;ion to James, repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of yielding to the times; and of waiting a fitter opportunity to make u&s;e of his Iri&s;h &s;ubjects. Mountjoy, on his arrival at Paris, in&s;tead of being favoured with an au|dience by James, to explain the rea&s;ons which Tyrconnel had &s;ugge&s;ted touching the inability of Ireland to re&s;tore his maje&s;ty, was committed pri&s;oner to the Ba&s;tile, on account of the zeal with which he had e&s;pou&s;ed the prote&s;tant intere&s;t. Al|though Lewis was &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t James effectually, his intentions were ob&s;tructed by the di&s;putes of his mini&s;try. Louvois po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the chief credit in council; but, Seignelai enjoyed a greater &s;hare of per&s;onal favour, both with the king and madam de Maintenon. To this nobleman, as &s;ecretary for ma|rine
<PB N="21" REF="240">
affairs, James made his chief application; and he had promi&s;ed the com|mand of the troops de&s;tined for his &s;ervice, to Lau&s;un, whom Louvois hated. For the&s;e rea&s;ons this mini&s;ter thwarted his mea&s;ures, and retarded the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which Lewis had promi&s;ed towards his re&s;toration.</P>

<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding all his oppo&s;ition, the &s;uccours were prepared, and the fleet ready to put to &s;ea by the latter end of February. The French king is &s;aid to have offered an army of fifteen thou&s;and natives of France to &s;erve in this expedition; but, James replied, that he would &s;ucceed by the help of his own &s;ubjects, or peri&s;h in the attempt. Accordingly he contented him&s;elf with about twelve hundred Briti&s;h &s;ubjects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James in this expedition was attended by the duke of Berwick and Mr. Fitzjames grand prior, the duke of Powis, the earls of Dover, Melfort, Abercorn, and Seaforth; the lords Henry and Tho|mas Howard, the lords Drummond, Dungan, Trendraught, Ruchan, Hun&s;don, and Brittas; the bi&s;hops of Che&s;ter and Ga$way, the late lord|chief-ju&s;tice H$rbert; the marquis D'E&s;trades, Mr. de Rozen marechal de camp; Mamoo, Pu|&s;ignan, and Lori lieutenant-generals, Prontee engineer general; the marquis de Alb$ville, Sir John Sparrow, Sir Roger Strickland, Sir William Jennings, Sir Henry Bond, Sir Charles Carney, Sir Edward Vaudrey, Sir Charles Murray, Sir Robert Parker, Sir Alphon&s;o Maiolo, Sir Samu$l Foxo$, and Sir William Wallis; the colonels P$$|ter, Sars$ield, Anthony and John Hamilton, Simon and Henry Lutterel, Ram&s;ay, Dorrington, Suther|land, Clifford, Parker, Pu$cel, Cannon, and Field|ing, with about two and twenty other officers of inferior rank.</NOTE> and a good number of French officers, who were embarked in the fleet at Bre&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen &s;hips of the line, &s;even frigates, three fire&s;hips, with a good number of tran&s;ports. The French king al&s;o &s;upplied him with a con&s;iderable quantity of arms for the u&s;e of his adherents in Ireland; accommodated him with a large &s;um of mo|ney, &s;uper$ equipages, &s;tore of plate, and nece&s;&s;aries of all kinds for the camp and the hou&s;hold. At parting, he pre&s;ented him with his own cuira&s;s, and embracing him affectionately, <Q>&startq;The be&s;t thing I can wi&s;h you (&s;aid he) is that I may never &s;ee you again.&endq;</Q> On the &s;eventh day of March James embarked at Bre&s;t, together with the count D'Avaux, who accompanied him in quality of amba&s;&s;ador, and his principal officers. He was detained in the harbour by con|trary winds till the &s;eventeenth day of the month, when he &s;et &s;ail, and on the twenty-&s;econd landed at Kin&s;ale in Ireland. By this time, king William per|ceiving him&s;elf amu&s;ed by Tyrconnel, had publi&s;hed a declaration, requiring the Iri&s;h to lay down their arms, and &s;ubmit to the new government. On the twenty-&s;econd day of February thirty &s;hips of war had been put in commi&s;&s;ion, and the command of them confered upon admiral Herbert; but, the arma|ment was retarded in &s;uch a manner by the di&s;putes of the council, and the king's attention to the affairs of the continent, that the admiral was not in a condition to &s;ail till the beginning of April, and then with part of his fleet only. James was received with open arms at Kin&s;ale, and the whole country &s;eemed to be at his devotion; for, although the prote&s;tants in the North had declared for the new government, their &s;trength and number was deemed incon|&s;iderable when compared with the power of Tyrconnel, who had di&s;armed all the other prote&s;tant &s;ubjects in one day, and a&s;&s;embled an army of thirty thou|&s;and foot, and eight thou&s;and cavalry for the &s;ervice of his ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>In the latter end of March, James made his public entry into Dublin, amid&s;t the acclamations of the inhabitants. He was met at the ca&s;tle|gate by a proce&s;&s;ion of popi&s;h bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts in their pontificals, bearing the
<PB N="22" REF="250">
ho&s;t, which he publicly adored. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the council-board, the lord Granard, judge Keating, and other prote&s;tants, who had exhorted the lord-lieutenant to an accommodation with the new government. In their room he admitted the French amba&s;&s;ador, the bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, colonel Dorrington, and by degrees, the principal noblemen who accompanied him in the expedition. On the &s;econd day after his arrival in Dublin, he i&s;&s;ued five proclamations: the fir&s;t recalling all the &s;ubjects of Ireland who had abandoned the kingdom, by a certain time, on pain of outlawry and confi&s;cation; and re|quiring all per&s;ons to join him again&s;t the prince of Orange. The &s;econd contained expre&s;&s;ions of acknowledgment to his catholic &s;ubjects for their vigilance and fidelity; and an injunction to &s;uch as were not actually in his &s;er|vice, to retain and lay up their arms until it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e them for his advantage. By the third he invited the &s;ubjects to &s;upply his army with provi&s;ions; and prohibited the &s;oldiers to take any thing without payment. By the fourth he rai&s;ed the value of the current coin. And in the fifth he &s;um|moned a parliament, to meet on the &s;eventh day of May at Dublin. Finally, he created Tyrconnel a duke, in con&s;ideration of his eminent &s;ervices.</P>

<P>The adherents of James in England pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;ettle the affairs of Ireland immediately, and bring over his army either to the north of England, or the we&s;t of Scotland, where it might be joined by his party, and act without delay again&s;t the u&s;urper; but, his council di&s;&s;uaded him from com|plying with their &s;olicitations, until Ireland &s;hould be totally reduced to obedi|ence. On the fir&s;t alarm of an intended ma&s;&s;acre, the prote&s;tants of London|derry had &s;hut their gates again&s;t the regiment commanded by the earl of An|trim; and re&s;olved to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the lord-lieutenant. They tran&s;mitted this re&s;olution to the government of England, together with an ac|count of the danger they incurred by &s;uch a vigorous mea&s;ure; and implored immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They were accor$ingly &s;upplied with &s;ome arms and ammunition; but, did not receive any con&s;iderable reinforcement till the middle of April, when two regiments arrived in Loughfoyl, under the com|mand of Cunningham and Richards. By this time king James had taken Cole|raine, inve&s;ted Killmore, and was almo&s;t in &s;ight of Londonderry. George Walker, rector of Donaghmore, who had rai&s;ed a regiment for the defence of the prote&s;tants, conveyed this intelligence to Lundy the governor. This officer directed him to join colonel Crafton, and take po&s;t at the Long-cau&s;ey, which he maintained a whole night again&s;t the advanced guard of the enemy, until being overpowered by numbers, he retreated to Londonderry, and exhorted the gover|nor to take the field, as the army of king James was not yet completely formed. Lundy a&s;&s;embling a council of war, at which Cunningham and Richards a&s;&s;i&s;ted, they agreed, that as the place was not tenable, it would be imprudent to land the two regiments; and that the principal officers &s;hould withdraw them&s;elves from Londonderry, the inhabitants of which would obtain the more favourable capitulation in con&s;equence of their retreat. An officer was imme|diately di&s;patched to king James, with propo&s;als of a negotiation; and lieute|nant-general Hamilton agreed, that the army &s;hould halt at the di&s;tance of four miles from the town. Notwith&s;tanding this preliminary, James advanced at the head of his troops; but met with &s;uch a warm reception from the be&s;ieged, that he was fain to retire to St. John's town in &s;ome di&s;order. The inhabitants
<PB N="23" REF="260">
and &s;oldiers in garri&s;on at Londonderry were &s;o incen&s;ed at the members of the council of war, who had re&s;olved to abandon the place, that they threatened immediate vengeance. Cunningham and Richards retired to their &s;hips; and Lundy locked him&s;elf in his chamber. In vain did Walker and major Baker exhort him to maintain his government. Such was his cowardice or treachery, that he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to be concerned in the defence of the place; and he was &s;uffered to e&s;cape in di&s;gui&s;e, with a load of match upon his back: but, he was afterwards apprehended in Scotland, from whence he was &s;ent to London, to an&s;wer for his per&s;idy or mi&s;conduct.</P>

<P>After his retreat, the town&s;men cho&s;e Mr. Walker and major Baker for their governors, with joint-authority; but, this office they would not undertake, until it had been offered to colonel Cunningham as the officer next in command to Lundy. He rejected the propo&s;al, and with Richards returned to England, where they were immediately ca&s;hiered. The two new governors, thus abandoned to their fate, began to prepare for a vigorous defence; and in|deed their courage &s;eems to have tran&s;cended the bounds of di&s;cretion; for, the place was very ill fortified: their cannon, which did not exceed twenty pieces, were wretchedly mounted; they had not one engineer to direct their operations; they had a very &s;mall number of hor&s;e; the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of people un|acquainted with military di&s;cipline; they were de&s;titute of provi&s;ions; they were be&s;ieged by a king in per&s;on, at the head of a formidable army, directed by good officers, and &s;upplied with all the nece&s;&s;ary implements for a &s;rege or battle. This town was inve&s;ted on the twentieth day of April; the batteries were &s;oon opened; and &s;everal attacks were made with great impetuo&s;ity: but, the be|&s;iegers were always repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. The town&s;men gained divers advantages in repeated &s;allies; and would have held their enemies in the utmo&s;t contempt, had not they been afflicted with a contagious di&s;temper, and reduced to extremity by want of provi&s;ion. They were even tantalized in their di&s;tre&s;s; for, they had the mortification to &s;ee &s;ome &s;hips which had arrived with &s;upplies from England, prevented from &s;ailing up the river by the batte|ries the enemy had rai&s;ed on both &s;ides, and a boom with which they had blocked up the channel. At length, a reinforcement arrived in the Lough, under the command of general Kirke, who had de&s;erted his ma&s;ter and been employed in the &s;ervice of king William. He found means to convey intelli|gence to Walker, that he had troops and provi&s;ions on board for their relief; but, found it impracticable to &s;ail up the river: he promi&s;ed, however, that he would land a body of forces at the Inch, and endeavour to make a diver&s;ion in their favour, when joined by the troops at Inni&s;killen, which amounted to five thou&s;and men, including two thou&s;and cavalry. He &s;aid he expected &s;ix thou|&s;and men from England, where they were embarked before he &s;et &s;ail$ He exhorted them to per&s;evere in their courage and loyalty, and a&s;&s;ured them he would come to their relief at all hazards. The&s;e a&s;&s;urances enabled them to bear their mi&s;eries a little longer, though their numbers daily dimini&s;hed; and major Baker dying, his place was filled with colonel Michelburn, who now acted as collegue to Mr. Walker.</P>

<P>King James having returned to Dublin to be pre&s;ent at the par|liament, the command of his army devolved to the French general Ro&s;ene, who was exa&s;perated at &s;uch an ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition by a handful of half&s;tarved
<PB N="24" REF="270">
militia. He threatened to raze the town to its foundations, and de&s;troy the inhabitants, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex, unle$$ they would immedi|ately &s;ubmit them&s;elves to their lawful &s;overeign. The governors treated his menaces with contempt; and publi&s;hed an order, that no per&s;on, on pain of death, &s;hould talk of &s;urrendering. They had now con&s;umed the la&s;t remains of their provi&s;ion, and &s;upported life by eating the fle&s;h of hor&s;es, dogs, cats, rats, mice, tallow, &s;tarch, and &s;alted hides; and even this loath&s;ome food began to fail. Ro&s;ene finding them deaf to all his propo&s;als, threatened to wreak his vengeance on all the prote&s;tants of that country, and drive them under the walls of Londonderry, where they &s;hould be &s;uffered to peri&s;h by famine. The bi&s;hop of Meath being informed of this de&s;ign, complained to king James of the barbarous intention, intreating his maje&s;ty to prevent its being put in exe|cution. That prince a&s;&s;ured him that he had already ordered Ro&s;ene to de&s;i&s;t from &s;uch proceedings. Neverthele&s;s, he executed his threats with the utmo&s;t ri|gour. Parties of dragoons were detached on this cruel &s;ervice, and after having &s;tripped all the prote&s;tants for thirty miles round, they drove the&s;e unhappy peo|ple before them like cattle; without even &s;paring the enfeebled old men, nur&s;es with infants at their brea&s;ts, tender children, women ju&s;t delivered, and &s;ome even in the pangs of labour. Above four thou&s;and of the&s;e mi&s;erable objects were driven under the walls of Londonderry. This expedient, far from an&s;wer|ing the purpo&s;e of Ro&s;ene, produced a quite contrary effect. The be&s;ieged were &s;o exa&s;perated at this act of inhumanity, that they re&s;olved to peri&s;h rather than &s;ubmit to &s;uch a barbarian. They erected a gibbet in &s;ight of the enemy, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the French general importing, That they would hang all the pri&s;oners they had taken during the &s;iege, unle&s;s the prote&s;tants whom they had driven under the walls, &s;hould be immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. This threat pro|duced a negotiation, in con&s;equence of which the prote&s;tants were relea&s;ed, after they had been detained three days without ta&s;ting food. Some hundreds died of famine or &s;atigue; and tho&s;e who lived to re$$rn to their own habita|tions, found them plundered and &s;acked by the papi&s;ts; &s;o that the greater num|ber peri&s;hed for want, or were murdered by the &s;traggling parties of the enemy: yet, tho&s;e very people had for the mo&s;t part obtained protections from king James, to which no re&s;pect was payed by his general.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="35" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>The garri&s;on of Londonderry was now reduced from &s;even to five thou&s;and &s;even hundred men; and the&s;e were driven to &s;uch extremity of di&s;tre&s;s, that they began to talk of killing the popi&s;h inhabitants, and feed|ing on their bodies. In this emergency, Kirke, who had hitherto lain inactive, ordered two &s;hips laden with provi&s;ion to &s;ail up the river, under convoy of the Dartmouth frigate. One of the&s;e, called the Mountjoy, broke the enemy's boom; and all the three, after having &s;u&s;tained a very hot fire from both &s;ides of the river, arrived in &s;afety at the town, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the inha|bitants. The army of James were &s;o di&s;pirited by the &s;ucce&s;s of this enter|prize, that they abandoned the &s;iege in the night; and retired with precipitation, after having l$&s;t about nine thou&s;and men before the place. Kirke no &s;ooner took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, than Walker was prevailed upon to embark for England, with an addre&s;s of thanks from the inhabitants to their maje&s;ties, for the &s;ea&s;onable r$$$ef they had received.</P>

<P>The Inni&s;killiners were no le&s;s remarkable than the people of Londonderry for the valour and per&s;everance with which they oppo&s;ed the pa|pi&s;ts. They rai&s;ed twelve companies, which they regimented under the com|mand of Gu&s;tavus Hamilton, whom they cho&s;e for their governor. They pro|claimed William and Mary on the eleventh day of March; and re&s;olved in a general council to maintain their title again&s;t all oppo&s;ition. The lord Gilmoy inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Crom belonging to the prote&s;tants in the neighbourhood of Inni&s;killin, the inhabitants of which threw &s;uccours into the place, and com|pelled Gilmoy to retire to Belturbet. A detach$ent of the garri&s;on, com|manded by lieutenant-colonel Lloyd, took and demoli&s;hed the ca&s;tle of Aughor; and they gained the advantage in &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes with the enemy. On the day that preceded the relief of Londonderry, they defeated &s;ix thou&s;and Iri&s;h pa|pi&s;ts at a place called Newton-Butler, and took their commander Maccarty, commonly called lord Monca&s;hel.</P>

<P>The Iri&s;h parliament being a&s;&s;embled at Dublin, according to the proclamation of king James, he, in a &s;peech from the throne, thanked them for the zeal, courage, and loyalty they had manife&s;ted; extolled the genero&s;ity of the French king, who had enabled him to vi&s;it them in per&s;on; in&s;i&s;ted upon executing his de&s;ign of e&s;tabli&s;hing liberty of con&s;cience, as a &s;tep equally agreeable to the dictates of humanity and di&s;cretion; and promi&s;ed to concur with them in enacting &s;uch laws as would contribute to the peace, afflu|ence, and &s;ecurity of his &s;ubjects. Sir Richard Neagle being cho&s;en &s;peaker of the commons, moved for an addre&s;s of thanks to his maje&s;ty; and that the count D'Avaux &s;hould be de&s;ired to make their acknowledgments to the mo&s;t chri&s;tian king, for the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had given to their &s;overeign. The&s;e addre&s;&s;es being drawn up, with the concurrence of both hou&s;es, a bill was brought in to recognize the king's title, to expre&s;s their abhorrence of the u&s;ur|pation by the prince of Orange, as well as of the defection of the Engli&s;h. Next day James publi&s;hed a declaration, complaining of the calumnies which his enemies had &s;pread to his prejudice; expatiating upon his own impartiality in preferring his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects; his care in protecting them from their enemies, in redre&s;&s;ing their grievances, and in granting liberty of con&s;cience; promi&s;ing that he would take no &s;tep but with the approbation of parliament; offering a free pardon to all per&s;ons who &s;hould de&s;ert his enemies, and join with him in four and twenty days after his landing in Ireland; and charging all the blood that might be &s;hed, upon tho&s;e who &s;hould continue in rebel|lion.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="38" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>His conduct, however, very ill agreed with this declaration; nor can it be excu&s;ed on any other &s;uppo&s;ition but that of his being governed in &s;ome ca&s;es again&s;t his own inclination, by the count D'Avaux, and the Iri&s;h catholics, on whom his whole dependance was placed. As both hou&s;es were chiefly filled with members of that per&s;ua&s;ion, we ought not to wonder at their bringing in a bill for repealing the act of &s;ettlement, by which the prote&s;tants of the kingdom had been &s;ecured in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates. The&s;e were by this law dive&s;ted of their lands, which reverted $o the heirs of tho&s;e catholics to whom they belonged before the rebellion. This iniquitous bill was framed in &s;uch a manner, that no regard was payed to &s;uch prote&s;tant owners as had purcha&s;ed e&s;tates for valuable con&s;iderations: no allowance was

<P>Yet, in order to complete their de&s;truction, an act of attainder was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t all prote&s;tants whether male or female, whether of high or low degree, who were ab&s;ent from the kingdom, as well as again&s;t all tho&s;e who retired into any part of the three kingdoms, which did not own the autho|rity of king James, or corre&s;ponded with rebels, or were any ways aiding, abetting, or a&s;&s;i&s;ting to them from the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t in the preceding year. The number of prote&s;tants attainted by name in this act, amounted to about three thou&s;and, including two archbi&s;hops, one duke, &s;eventeen earls, &s;even counte&s;&s;es, as many bi&s;hops, eighteen barons, three and thirty baronets, one and fifty knights, eighty-three clergymen, who were declared traitors, and ad|judged to &s;uffer the pains of death and forfeiture. The individuals &s;ubjected to this dreadful pro&s;cription, were even cut off from all hope of pardon, and all benefit of appeal: for, by a clau&s;e in the act, the king's pardon was de$med null, unle&s;s enrolled before the fir&s;t day of December; and a &s;ub&s;equent law was enacted, declaring Ireland independent of the Engli&s;h parliament. This a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed another act, granting twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum, out of the forfeited e&s;tates, to Tyrconnel, in acknowledgement of his &s;ignal &s;ervices$ they impo&s;ed a tax of twenty thou&s;and pounds per month for the &s;ervice of the king: the royal a&s;&s;ent was given to an act for liberty of con&s;cience: they enacted that the tythes payable by papi&s;ts &s;hould be delivered to prie&s;ts of that communion: the maintenance of the prote&s;tant clergy in cities and corpora|tions was taken away: and all di&s;&s;enters were exempted from eccle&s;ia&s;tical ju|ri&s;dictions. So that the e&s;tabli&s;hed church was deprived of all power and pre|rogative; notwith&s;tanding the expre&s;s promi&s;e of James, who had declared im|mediately after his landing, that he would maintain the clergy in their rights and privileges</P>

<P>Nor was the king le&s;s arbitrary in the executive part of his government, if we &s;uppo&s;e that he countenanced the grievous acts of oppre&s;&s;ion that were daily committed upon the prote&s;tant &s;ubjects of Ireland: but the tyranny of his proceedings may be ju&s;tly imputed to the temper of his mini&s;try, con|&s;i&s;ting of men abandoned to all &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice and humanity, who acted from the dictates of rapa$ity and revenge, inflamed with all the acrimony of re|ligious rancour. Soldiers were permitted to live upon free quarter; the people were robbed and plundered; licences and protections were abu&s;ed, in order to extort money from the trading part of the nation. The king's old &s;tores were ran&s;acked, the &s;hops of trade&s;men, and the kitchens of burghers, were pillaged to &s;upply the mint with a quantity of bra&s;s, which was converted into current coin for his maje&s;ty's occa&s;ions. An arbitrary value was &s;et upon it, and all per&s;ons were required and commanded to take it in payment, un|der the &s;evere&s;t penalties, though the proportion between its intrin&s;ic worth and currency was nearly as one to three hundred. A va&s;t &s;um of this counter|feit
<PB N="27" REF="300">
coin was i&s;&s;ued in the cour&s;e of one year, and forced upon the prote&s;tants in payment of merchandize, provi&s;ion, and nece&s;&s;aries for the king's &s;ervice. James, not content with the &s;upply granted by parliament, impo&s;ed by his own authority a tax of twenty thou&s;and pounds per month on chattels, as the former was laid upon lands. This &s;eems to have been a temporary expedient, during the adjournment of the two hou&s;es, as the term of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment was limited to three months: it was, however, levied by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion under the &s;eals; and &s;eems to have been a &s;tretch of the prerogative the le&s;s excu&s;able, as he might have obtained the money in a parliamentary way. Under&s;tanding that the prote&s;tants had laid out all their bra&s;s money, in pur|cha&s;ing great quantities of hides, tallow, wool, and corn, he a&s;&s;umed the de&s;potic power of fixing the prices of the&s;e commodities, and then bought them for his own u&s;e. One may &s;ee his mini&s;ters were bent upon the utter de&s;truction of tho&s;e unhappy people.</P>

<P>All vacancies in public &s;chools were &s;upplied with popi&s;h teachers. The pen&s;ion allowed from the exchequer to the univer&s;ity of Dublin, was cut off: the vice-provo&s;t, fellows, and &s;cholars, were expelled: their furniture, plate, and public library, were &s;eized, without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of pretence, and in direct violation of the king's promi&s;e to pre&s;erve their privileges and immu|nities. His officers converted the college into a garri&s;on, the chapel into a magazine, and the apartments into pri&s;ons: a popi&s;h prie&s;t was appointed pro|vo&s;t; one Maccarty of the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion was made library-keeper; and the whole foundation was changed into a catholic &s;eminary. When bi&s;hoprics and benefices in the gift of the crown became vacant, the king ordered the profits to be lodged in the exchequer, and &s;uffered the cures to be totally neglected. The revenues were chiefly employed in the maintenance of romi&s;h bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts, who grew &s;o in&s;olent under this indulgence, that in &s;everal places they forcibly &s;eized the prote&s;tant churches. When complaint was made of this outrage, the king promi&s;ed to do ju&s;tice to the injured; and in &s;ome places actually ordered the churches to be re&s;tored: but the popi&s;h clergy refu&s;ed to comply with his order, alledging, that in &s;pirituals they owed obedience to no earthly power but the holy &s;ee; and James found him&s;elf unable to protect his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects again&s;t a powerful body which he dur&s;t not di&s;oblige. Some &s;hips appearing in the bay of Dublin, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, for|bidding the prote&s;tants to a&s;&s;emble in any place of wor&s;hip, or el&s;ewhere, on pain of death. By a &s;econd, they were commanded to bring in their arms, on pain of being treated as rebels and traitors. Lutterel governor of Dublin publi&s;hed an ordinance by beat of drum, requiring the farmers to bring in their corn for his maje&s;ty's hor&s;es within a certain day, otherwi&s;e he would order them to be hanged before their own doors. Brigadier Sarsfield com|manded all prote&s;tants of a certain di&s;trict to retire to the di&s;tance of ten miles from their habitations, on pain of death; and, in order to keep up the credit of the bra&s;s money, the &s;ame penalty was denounced, in a proclamation, again&s;t any per&s;on who &s;hould give more than one pound eighteen &s;hillings for a guinea.</P>

the French monarch. After the return of the fleet which had conveyed him to Ireland, Lewis &s;ent another &s;trong &s;quadron, commanded by Chateau Renault, as a convoy to &s;ome tran&s;ports laden with arms, ammunition, and a large &s;um of money for the u&s;e of king James. Before they &s;ailed from Bre&s;t, king William being informed of their de&s;tination, detached admiral Herbert from Spithead, with twelve &s;hips of the line, one fire&s;hip, and four tenders, in order to inter|c$pt the enemy. He was driven by &s;tre&s;s of weather into Milford-haven, from whence he &s;teered his cour&s;e to Kin&s;ale, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the French fleet had &s;ailed from Bre&s;t; and that in all probability he would fall in w$th them on the coa&s;t of Ireland. On the fir&s;t day of May, he di&s;covered them at anchor in Bantrey-bay, and &s;tood in to engage them, though they were greatly &s;uperior to him in number. They no &s;ooner perceived him at day-break, than they weighed, &s;tood out to windward, formed their line, bore down and began the action, which was ma$ntained for two hours with equal valour on both &s;ides, though the Engli&s;h fleet &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage from the &s;uperior fire of the enemy. Herbert tacked &s;everal times, in hope of gaining the weather-gage; but the French admiral kept his wind with un|common &s;kill and per&s;everance. At length the Engli&s;h &s;quadron &s;tood off to &s;ea, and maintained a running fight till five in the afternoon, when Chateau Renault tacked about and returned into the bay, content with the honour he had gained. The lo&s;s of men was incon&s;iderable on both &s;ides; and, where the odds were &s;o great, the victor could not reap much glory. Herbert retired to the i&s;les of Scilly, where he expected a reinforcement; but being di&s;ap|pointed in this expectation, he returned to Port&s;mouth, in very ill humour, with which his officers and men were infected. The common &s;ailors &s;till re|tained &s;ome attachment to James, who had formerly been a favourite among them; and the officers complained that they had been &s;ent upon this &s;ervice with a force &s;o much inferior to that of the enemy. King William, in order<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> to appea&s;e their di&s;content, made an excur&s;ion to Port&s;mouth, where he dined with the admiral on board the &s;hip Elizabeth, declared his intention of creating him an earl, in con&s;ideration of his good conduct and &s;ervices, conferred the honour of knighthood on the captains A&s;hby and Shovel, and be&s;towed a d$nation of ten &s;hillings on every private &s;ailor.</P>

<P>The parliament of England thought it incumbent upon them, not only to rai&s;e &s;upplies for the maintenance of the war in which the nation was $$volved, but al&s;o to do ju&s;tice with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who had been injured by $$legal or oppre&s;&s;ive &s;entences in the late reigns. The attainders of lord Ru&s;|&s;el$ Algernoon Sidney, Alderman Corni&s;h, and the lady Li&s;le, were now re|ver&s;ed. A committee of privileges was appointed by the lords, to examine the ca&s;e of the earl of Devon&s;hire, who in the late reign had been fined in thirty thou&s;and pounds for a&s;&s;aulting colonel Culpepper in the pre&s;ence-cham|ber. They reported that the court of king's-bench, in over-ruling the earl's plea of privilege of parliament, had committed a manife&s;t breach of privi|lege: that the fine was exce&s;&s;ive and exorbitant, again&s;t the great charter, the common right of the &s;ubject, and the law of the realm. The &s;entence pronounced upon Samuel John&s;on chaplain to lord Ru&s;&s;el, in con&s;equence of which he had been degraded, fined, &s;courged, and &s;et in the pillory, was now annulled, and the commons recommended him to his maje&s;ty for &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tical

prefe$$ent. He received one thou&s;and pounds in money, with a pen|&s;ion of three hundred pounds for his own life and that of his &s;on, who was moreover gratified with a place of one hundred pounds a year; but the father never obtained any eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefice. Titus Oates &s;eized this opportunity of petitioning the hou&s;e of lords for a rever&s;al of the judgment given again&s;t him on his being convicted of perjury. The opinions of all the judges and coun&s;el at the bar were heard on this &s;ubject, and a bill of rever&s;al pa&s;&s;ed the commons; but the peers having in&s;erted &s;ome amendments and a provi&s;o, a conference was demanded, and violent heats en&s;ued. Oates, however, was relea&s;ed from confinement; and the lords, with the con&s;ent of the commons, recommended him to his maje&s;ty for a pardon, which he obtained, together with a comfortable pen&s;ion. The committee appointed to inquire into the ca&s;es of the &s;tate-pri&s;oners, found Sir Robert Wright, late lord chief ju&s;tice to have been concerned in the cruelties committed in the We&s;t after the in&s;ur|rection of Monmouth; as al&s;o one of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ioners, and guilty of manifold enormities. Death had by this time delivered Jeffries from the re&s;entment of the nation. Graham and Burton, who had acted as &s;ollici|tors in the illegal pro&s;ecutions carried on again&s;t tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the court in the reign of Charles II. were reported guilty of having been in&s;trumental in taking away the lives and e&s;tates of tho&s;e who had &s;uffered the lo&s;s of either under colour of law for eight years la&s;t pa&s;t; of having, by malicious in|dictments, informations, and pro&s;ecutions of Quo Warranto, endeavoured the &s;ubver&s;ion of the prote&s;tant religion, and the government of the realm; and of having wa&s;ted many thou&s;and pounds of the public revenue in the cour&s;e of the&s;e infamous practices.</P>

<P>Nor did the mi&s;conduct of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try e&s;cape the ani|madver&s;ion of the parliament. The lords having addre&s;&s;ed the king to put the i&s;le of Wight, Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, Scilly, Dov$r-ca&s;tle, and the other for|tre&s;&s;es of the kingdom, in a po&s;ture of defence, and to di&s;arm the papi&s;ts, em|powered a committee to enquire into the mi&s;carriages in Ireland, which were generally imputed to the neglect of the marqui&s;&s;es of Caermarthen and Halli|$ax. They pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring the minute book of the committee for Iri&s;h affairs might be put into their hands; but his maje&s;ty de|clined gratifying them in this particular: then the commons voted, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who had advi&s;ed the king to delay this &s;atisfaction were enemies to the kingdom. William, alarmed at this re&s;olution, allowed them to in&s;pect the book, in which they found very little for their purpo&s;e. The hou&s;e re|&s;olved that an addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, declaring that the &s;uccour of Ireland had been retarded by unnece&s;&s;ary delays; that the tran&s;ports prepared were not &s;ufficient to convey the forces to that kingdom; and that &s;everal &s;hips had been taken by the enemy, for want of proper convoy. At the &s;ame time the que&s;tion was put, Whether or not they &s;hould addre&s;s the king again&s;t the marquis of Hallifax? But it was carried in the negative by a &s;mall majority. Before this period, Howe vice-chamberlain to the queen had moved for an addre&s;s again&s;t &s;uch coun&s;ellors as had been impeached in par|liament, and betrayed the liberties of the nation. This motion was levelled at Carma$rthen and Hallifax, the fir&s;t of whom had been formerly impeached of high trea&s;on, under the title of earl of Danby; and the other was charged
<PB N="$0" REF="330">
with all the mi&s;conduct of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. Warm debates en&s;ued, and in all probability the motion would have been carried in the affirmative, had not tho&s;e who &s;poke warmly in behalf of it, &s;uddenly cooled in the cour&s;e of the di&s;pute. Some letters from king James to his parti&s;ans being inter|cepted, and containing &s;ome hints of an intended inva&s;ion, Mr. Hambden, chairman of the committee of the whole hou&s;e, enlarged upon the imminent danger to which the kingdom was expo&s;ed, and moved for a further &s;upply to his maje&s;ty. In this unexpected motion, he was not &s;econded by one mem|ber. The hou&s;e, however, having taken the letters into con&s;ideration, re&s;olved to draw up an addre&s;s to the king, de$$ring him to &s;ecure and di&s;arm all pa|pi&s;ts of note; and they brought in a bill for attainting &s;everal per&s;ons in re|bellion again&s;t their $aje&s;ties; but it was not fini&s;hed during this &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Another bill being prepared in the hou&s;e of lords, enjoining the &s;ubjects to wear the woollen manufacture at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year, a pe|tition was pre&s;ented again&s;t it by the &s;ilk-weavers of London and Canterbury, a&s;&s;embled in a tumultuous manner at We&s;tmin&s;ter. The lords refu&s;ed their petition, becau&s;e this was an unu&s;ual manner of application. They were per|&s;u$ded to return to their re&s;pective places of abode: precautions were taken again&s;t a &s;econd riot; and the bill was unanimou&s;ly rejected in the upper hou&s;e. This parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act, ve&s;ting the pre&s;entations belonging to papi&s;ts in the two univer&s;ities; tho&s;e of the &s;outhern counties being given to Oxford; and tho&s;e of the northern to Cambridge, on certain &s;pecified conditions. Courts of con&s;cience were erected at Bri&s;tol, Glouce&s;ter, and Newca&s;tle; and that of the Marches of Wales was aboli&s;hed, as an intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion on that country. The prote&s;tant clergymen who had been forced to leave their bene|fices in Ireland, were rendered capable of holding any living in England, with|out forfeiting their title to their former preferment, with the provi&s;o that they &s;hould re&s;ign their Engli&s;h benefices when re&s;tored to tho&s;e they had been obliged to relinqui&s;h. The &s;tatute of Henry IV. again&s;t multiplying gold and &s;ilver was now repealed: the &s;ubjects were allowed to melt and refine metals and ores, and extract gold and &s;ilver from them, on condition that it &s;hould be brought to the Mint and converted into money, the owners receiving its full value in current coin. The&s;e, and &s;everal other bills of &s;maller im|portance being pa&s;&s;ed, the two hou&s;es adjourned to the twentieth day of Sep|tember, and afterwards to the nineteenth day of October.</P>

<P>THOUGH the affairs of Ireland were extremely pre&s;&s;ing, and the prote&s;tants of that country had made repeated application for relief, the &s;uccours were retarded either by the di&s;putes among the mini&s;ters, or the neglect of tho&s;e who had the management of the expedition, in &s;uch a manner, that king James had been &s;ix months in Ireland before the army was embarked for that kingdom. At length, eighteen regiments of infantry, and five of dra|goons being rai&s;ed for that &s;ervice, a train of artillery provided, and tran&s;ports

prepared, the duke of Schomberg, on whom king William had conferred the chief command of this armament, &s;et out for Che&s;ter, after he had in per&s;on thanked the commons for the uncommon regard they had payed to his &s;ervices; and received a&s;&s;urances from the hou&s;e that they would pay particular attention to him and his army. On the thirteenth day of Augu&s;t he landed in the neigh|bourhood of Carrick $ergus with about ten thou&s;and $oot and dragoons, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Be$fa&s;t, from whence the $ne$y retired at his $pproach to Carrick|&s;ergus, where they re&s;olved to make a &s;tand. The duke having refre&s;hed his men, marched thither and inve&s;ted the place$ the &s;iege was carried on till the twenty-&s;ixth day of the month, when the breaches being practicable, the be|&s;ieged capitulated, on condition of marching out with their arms and as much baggage as they could carry on their backs; and of their being conducted to the next Iri&s;h garri&s;on, which was at Newry. During this &s;iege the duke was joined by the re&s;t of his army from England; but, he had left orders for conveying the greater part of the artillery and $tores from Che&s;ter directly to Carling|ford. He now began his march through Li&s;burne and Hil&s;borough, encamped at Drummore, where the prote&s;tants of the North had been lately routed by Hamilton; thence he proceeded to Loughbrillane, where he was joined by the hor$e and dragoons of In$$killin. Then the enemy abandoned Newry and Dun|dalk, in the neighbourhood of which Schomberg encamped on a low, damp, ground, having the town and river on the &s;outh, and &s;urrounded on every other part by hills, bogs, and mountains.</P>

<P>His army con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of new-rai&s;ed men little inured to hard&s;hip, began to flag under the fatigue of marching, the inclemency of the weather, and &s;carcity of provi&s;ion. Here he was reinforced by the regiments of Kirke, Hanmer, and Stuart; and would have continued his march to Drogheda, where he under&s;tood Ro&s;ene lay with about twenty thou&s;and men, had not he been obliged to wait for the artillery, which was not yet arrived at Carlingford. King James having a&s;&s;embled all his forces, advanced towards Schomberg, and ap|peared before his intrenchments in order of battle; but, the duke knowing they were greatly &s;upetior in number of hor&s;e, and that his own army was undi&s;ci|plined, and weakened by death and &s;ickne&s;s, re&s;trained his men within the lines; and in a little time the enemy retreated. Immediately after their departure, a con&s;piracy was di&s;covered in the Engli&s;h camp, hatched by &s;ome French papi&s;ts, who had in&s;inuated them&s;elves into the prote&s;tant regiments. One of the&s;e, who&s;e name was Du Ple&s;&s;is, had written a letter to the amba&s;&s;ador D'Avaux, pro|mi&s;ing to de&s;ert with all the papi&s;ts of the three French regiments in Schomberg's army. This letter being found, Du Ple&s;&s;is and five accomplices were tried by a court-martial, and executed. About two hundred and fifty papi&s;ts being di&s;|covered in the French regiments, they were &s;ent over to England, and from thence to Holland. Wh$le Schomberg remained in this &s;ituation, the Inni&s;kil|liners made excur&s;ions in the neighbourhood, under the command of colonel Lloyd; and on the twenty-&s;eventh day of September, they obtained a complete victory over five times their number of the Iri&s;h; having killed &s;even hun|dred on the &s;pot, and taken O Kelly their commander, with about fifty off$cers, and a con&s;iderable booty of cattle. The duke was &s;o plea&s;ed with their behavi|our on this occa&s;ion, that they received a very honourable te&s;timony of his ap|probation.</P>

<P>Mean while the enemy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of James-Town, and reduced Sligo, one of the forts of which was gallantly defended by St. Sauveur, a French captain, and his company of grenadiers, until he was obliged to capitulate for want of water and provi&s;ion. A contagious di&s;temper &s;till continued to rage in Schomberg's camp, and &s;wept off a great number of officers and &s;oldiers: &s;o that in the beginning of next &s;pring, not above half the number of tho&s;e who went over with the general, remained alive. He was cen&s;ured for his in|activity; and the king in repeated letters de&s;ired him to hazard an engagement, provided any opportunity &s;hould occur: but, he did not think proper to run the ri&s;que of a battle, again&s;t an enemy that was above thrice his number, well|di&s;ciplined, healthy, and conducted by able officers. Neverthele&s;s, he was cer|tainly blameable for having cho&s;en &s;uch an unwhole&s;ome &s;ituation; from whence, at the approach of winter, he retired into quarters, in hope of being reinforced with &s;even thou&s;and Danes who had already arrived in Britain. The&s;e auxiliaries were &s;tipulated in a treaty which William had ju&s;t concluded with the king of Denmark. The Engli&s;h were not more &s;ucce&s;sful at &s;ea than they had proved in their operations by land. Admiral Herbert, now created earl of Torrington, having &s;ailed to Ireland with the combined &s;quadrons of England and Holland, made a fruitle&s;s attempt upon Cork, and $o&s;t a great number of &s;eamen by &s;ickne&s;s, which was imputed to bad provi&s;ion. The Dartmouth &s;hip of war fell into the hands of the enemy, who infe&s;ted the channel with &s;uch a number of armed &s;hips and privateers, that the trade of England &s;u&s;tained incredible damage.</P>

<P>The affairs of France wore but a gloomy a&s;pect on the continent, where all the powers of Europe &s;eemed to have con&s;pired her de&s;truction. King William had engaged in a new league with the &s;tates-general, in which former treaties of peace and commerce were confirmed. It was &s;tipulated, that in ca&s;e the king of Great-Britain &s;hould be attacked, the Dutch &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him with &s;ix thou&s;and infantry and twenty &s;hips of the line; and that, provided ho&s;tilities &s;hould be committed again&s;t the &s;tates-general, England &s;hould &s;upply them with ten thou&s;and infantry and twenty &s;hips of war. This treaty was no &s;ooner ratified than king William di&s;patched the lord Churchill, whom he had by this time created earl of Marlborough, to Holland, in order to command the Briti&s;h auxiliaries in that &s;ervice, to the number of eleven thou&s;and, the greater part of which had been in the army of king James when the prince of Orange landed in England. He forthwith joined the Dutch army under the command of prince Waldec, who had fixed his rendezvous in the county of Liege, with a view to act again&s;t the French army commanded by the marechal D'Humieres, while the prince of Vaudemont headed a little army of ob&s;ervation, con&s;i&s;ting of Spaniards, Dutch, and Germans, to watch the motions of Calvo in another part of the Low-Countries. The city of Liege was compelled to renounce the neu|trality and declare for the allies. Marechal D'Humieres attacked the foragers belonging to the army of the &s;tates at Walcourt, in the month of Augu&s;t; an ob&s;tinate engagement en&s;ued, and the French were obliged to retreat in confu|&s;ion, with the lo&s;s of two thou&s;and men, and &s;ome pieces of artillery. The army of ob&s;ervation levelled part of the French lines on the &s;ide of Courtray; and rai&s;ed contributions on the territories of the enemy.</P>

<P>The French were almo&s;t intire ma&s;ters of the three eccle&s;ia&s;tical electorates of Germany. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Mentz, Triers, Bonne, Kei&s;er&s;waert, Philip&s;burg,
<PB N="34" REF="370">
and Land$n. They had blown up the ca&s;tle of Heidelberg in the Palatinate, and de&s;troyed Manheim. They had reduced Worms and Spires to a&s;hes; and demoli&s;hed Frankendahl, together with &s;everal other fortre&s;&s;es. The&s;e conque&s;ts, the fruits of &s;udden inva&s;ion, were covered with a numerous army, commanded by the marechal de Duras; and all his inferior generals were officers of di&s;tingui&s;hed courage and ability. Neverthele&s;s, he found it difficult to maintain his ground again&s;t the different princes of the empire. The duke of Lorraine, who com|manded the imperial troops, inve&s;ted Mentz, and took it by capitulation: the el$$tor of Brandenburgh having reduced Kei&s;er&s;waert, undertook the &s;iege of Bonne, which the garri&s;on &s;urrendered, after having made a long and vigorous defence. Nothing contributed more to the union of the German princes than their re&s;entment of the &s;hocking barbarity with which the French had plun|dered, wa&s;ted, and depopulated their country. Lewis having by his intrigues in Poland, and at Con&s;tantinople, prevented a pacification between the empe|ror and the Ottoman-porte, the campaign was opened in Croatia, where five thou&s;and Turks were defeated by a body of Croats between Vihitz and Novi. The prince of Baden, who commanded the Imperiali&s;ts on that &s;ide, having thrown a bridge over the Morava at Pa&s;&s;arowitz, cro&s;&s;ed that river, and marched in que&s;t of the Turki&s;h army, amounting to fifty thou&s;and men, headed by a $era&s;kier. On the thirtieth day of Augu&s;t he attacked the enemy in their en|trenchments near Patochin, forced their lines, routed them with great &s;laugh|ter, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their camp, baggage, and artillery. They retreated to Ni$$a, where their general finding them &s;till more numerous than the Impe|riali&s;ts, re&s;olved to make a &s;tand; and encamped in a &s;ituation that was inac|ce&s;&s;ible in every part except the rear, which he left open for the convenience of a retreat. Through this avenue he was, on the twenty-fourth day of September, attacked by the prince of Baden, who, after a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance, obtained an|other complete victory, enriched his troops with the &s;poils of the enemy; and entered Ni&s;&s;a without oppo&s;ition. There he found above three thou&s;and hor&s;es and a va&s;t quantity of provi&s;ion. Having repo&s;ed his army for a few days in this place, he re&s;umed his march again&s;t the Turks, who had cho&s;en an advan|tageous po&s;t at Widin, and &s;eemed ambitious of retrieving the honour they had lo&s;t in the two former engagements. The Germans attacked their lines with|out he$itation; and though the Mu&s;&s;ulmans fought with incredible fury, they were a third time defeated with great &s;laughter. This defeat was attended with the lo&s;s of Widin, which being &s;urrendered to the victor, he di&s;tributed his troops in winter-quarters, and returned to Vienna covered with laurels.</P>

<P>The French were likewi&s;e baffled in their attempt upon Catalonia, where the duke de Noailles had taken Campredon, in the month of May. Leaving a garri&s;on in this place, he retreated to the frontiers of France, while the duke de Villa Hermo&s;a, at the head of a Spani&s;h army, blocked up the place, and laid Rou&s;illon under contribution. He afterwards undertook the &s;iege in form, and Noailles marched to its relief; but, he was &s;o hard pre&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards, that he withdrew the garri&s;on, di&s;mantled the place, and retreated with great precipitation. The French king hoped to derive &s;ome con&s;iderable advantage from the death of pope Innocent XI. which happened on the twelfth day of Augu&s;t. That pontiff had been an inveterate enemy to Lewis ever &s;ince the affair of the franchi&s;es, and the &s;eizure of Avignon.

Peter Otto|boni, a Venetian, was elected pope, and a&s;&s;umed the name of Alexander VIII. The duke de Chaulnes amba&s;&s;ador from France, immediately &s;ignified, in the name of his ma&s;ter, that Avignon &s;hould be re&s;tored to the patrimony of the church; and Lewis renounced the franchi&s;es in a letter written by his own hand to the new pontiff. Alexander received the&s;e marks of re&s;pect with the warme&s;t acknowledgments; but, when the amba&s;&s;ador and Fur&s;temberg be&s;ought him to re-examine the election of the bi&s;hop of Cologne, which had been the &s;ource of &s;o much calamity to the empire, he lent a deaf ear to their &s;ollicitations. He even confirmed the di&s;pen&s;ations granted by his predece&s;&s;or to the prince of Bavaria, who was thus impowered to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the electorate, though he had not yet attained the age required by the canons.

<P>King William found it an ea&s;ier task to unite the councils of Europe again&s;t the common enemy, than to conciliate and pre&s;erve the affections of his own &s;ubjects, among whom he began vi&s;ibly to decline in point of popularity. Many were di&s;&s;atisfied with his mea&s;ures; and a great number even of tho&s;e who had exerted them&s;elves for his elevation, had conceived a di&s;gu&s;t from his per&s;onal deportment, which was very un&s;uitable to the manners and di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h people. In&s;tead of mingling with his nobility in &s;ocial amu&s;e|ments and familiar conver&s;ation, he maintained a di&s;agreeable re&s;erve which had all the air of &s;ullen pride; he &s;eldom or never &s;poke to his courtiers or attend|ants; he &s;pent his time chiefly in the clo&s;et retired from all communication; or among his troops in a camp he had formed at Houn&s;low; or in the exerci&s;e of hunting, to which he was immoderately addicted. This had been pre&s;cribed to him by phy&s;icians, as nece&s;&s;ary to improve his con&s;titution, which was naturally weak; and by practice had become &s;o habitual, that he could not lay it a&s;ide. His ill health co-operating with his natural aver&s;ion to &s;ociety, produced a peevi&s;hne&s;s which could not fail of being di&s;plea&s;ing to tho&s;e who were near his per&s;on; and this was increa&s;ed by the di&s;putes in his cabinet, and the oppo&s;ition of tho&s;e who were profe&s;&s;ed enemies to his government, as well as by the aliena|tion of his former friends. As he could not breathe without difficulty in the air of London, he re&s;ided chiefly at Hampton-Court, and expended con&s;ider|able &s;ums in beautifying and enlarging that palace; he likewi&s;e purcha&s;ed the hou&s;e at Ken&s;ington of the earl of Nottingham; and &s;uch profu&s;ion, in the be|ginning of an expen&s;ive war, gave umbrage to the nation in general. Whether he was advi&s;ed by his coun&s;ellors, or his own &s;agacity pointed out the expedi|ency of conforming with the Engli&s;h humour, he now &s;eemed to change his di&s;po&s;ition, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure adopt the manners of his predece&s;&s;ors. In imitation of Charles II. he re&s;orted to the races at Newmarket; he accepted an invitation to vi&s;it Cambridge, where he behaved with remarkable affability to the members of the univer&s;ity; he afterwards dined with the lord-mayor of London, accepted the freedom of the city, and conde&s;cended &s;o far as to become &s;overeign$ma&s;ter of the company of grocers.</P>

<P>While William thus endeavoured to remove the prejudices which had been conceived again&s;t his per&s;on, the period arrived which the parliament had
<PB N="36" REF="390">
pre&s;cribed for taking the oaths to the new government. Some individuals of the clergy &s;acrificed their benefices to their &s;cruples of con&s;cience; and ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to take oaths that were contrary to tho&s;e they had already &s;worn in favour of their late &s;overeign. The&s;e were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the epithet of Nonjurors; but their number bore a very &s;mall proportion to that of others, who took them with &s;uch re&s;ervations and di&s;tinctions as redounded very little to the honour of their integrity. Many of tho&s;e who had been the warme&s;t advocates for non-re&s;i&s;tance and pa&s;&s;ive obedience, made no &s;cruple of renounc|ing their allegiance to king James, and complying with the pre&s;ent act, after having declared that they took the oaths in no other &s;en&s;e than that of a peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the powers that were. They even affirmed that the legi&s;lature it&s;elf had allowed the di&s;tinction between a king de facto and a king de jure, as they had dropped the word "rightful" when the form was under debate. They alledged that as prudence obliged them to conform to the letter of the oath, &s;o con&s;cience required them to give it their own interpretation. Nothing could be more infamous, and of wor&s;e tendency, than this practice of equivocating in the mo&s;t &s;acred of all obligations. It introduced a general di&s;regard of oaths, which hath been the &s;ource of univer&s;al perjury and corruption. Though this &s;et of tempori&s;ers were bitterly upbraided both by the nonjurors and the papi&s;ts, they all concurred in repre&s;enting William as an enemy to the church; as a prince educated in the doctrines of Calvin, which he plainly e&s;pou&s;ed by limit|ing his favour and preferment to &s;uch as were latitudinarians in religion, and by his aboli&s;hing epi&s;copacy in Scotland. The pre&s;byterians of that kingdom now tyranni&s;ed in their turn. They were headed by the earl of Crawford, a nobleman of a violent temper and &s;trong prejudices. He was cho&s;en pre&s;ident of the parliament by the intere&s;t of Melvil, and oppre&s;&s;ed the epi&s;copalians in &s;uch a manner, that the greater part of them, from re&s;entment, became well|wi&s;hers to king James. Every circum&s;tance of the hard&s;hips they underwent, was reported in England; and the earl of Clarendon, as well as the &s;u&s;pended bi&s;hops, circulated the&s;e particulars with great a&s;&s;iduity. The oaths being re|jected by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the bi&s;hops of Ely, Chiche&s;ter, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, and Glouce&s;ter, they were &s;u&s;pended from their func|tions, and threatened with deprivation, Lake of Chiche&s;ter being &s;eized with a dangerous di&s;temper, &s;igned a &s;olemn declaration, in which he profe&s;&s;ed his adherence to the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance and pa&s;&s;ive obedience, which he be|lieved to be the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the church of England. After his death, this paper was publi&s;hed, indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated, and extolled by the party, as an in&s;pired oracle pronounced by a martyr to religious truth and &s;in|cerity.</P>

<P>All the clamour that was rai&s;ed again&s;t the king could not divert him from pro&s;ecuting the &s;cheme of comprehen&s;ion. He granted a commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal to ten bi&s;hops, and twenty dignitaries of the church, authori&s;|ing them to meet from time to time in the Jeru&s;alem-chamber, to prepare &s;uch alteration of the liturgy and the canons, and &s;uch propo&s;als for the reformation of eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, as might mo&s;t conduce to the good order, edification, and uniting of the church; and tend to reconcile all religious differences among the prote&s;tant &s;ubjects of the kingdom. A cry was immediately rai&s;ed again&s;t this commi&s;&s;ion, as an eccle&s;ia&s;tical court illegal and dangerous. At their fir&s;t
<PB N="37" REF="400">
meeting, the authority of the commi&s;&s;ion was que&s;tioned by Sprat bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, who retired in di&s;gu&s;t, and was followed by Mew of Winche&s;ter, and the doctors Jane and Aldrich. The&s;e were aver&s;e to any alteration of the forms and con&s;titution of the church, in favour of an in&s;olent and ob&s;tinate party, which ought to have been &s;atisfied with the toleration they enjoyed. They ob&s;erved, that an attempt to make &s;uch alteration would divide the clergy, and bring the liturgy into $i&s;e&s;teem with the people, as it would be a plain acknowledgment that it wanted correction. They thought they &s;hould violate the dignity of the church, by conde&s;cending to make offers which the di&s;&s;enters were at liberty to refu&s;e; and they &s;u&s;pected &s;ome of their colleagues of a de&s;ign to give up epi&s;copal ordination; a &s;tep incon&s;i&s;tent with their honour, duty, oaths, and &s;ub&s;criptions.</P>

<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners, notwith&s;tanding this &s;ece&s;&s;ion, proceeded to debate with moderation on the abu&s;es of which the di&s;&s;enters had complained, and corrected every article that &s;eemed liable to any ju&s;t objection: but the op|po&s;ite party employed all their art and indu&s;try to inflame the minds of the people: the two univer&s;ities declared again&s;t all alterations, and tho&s;e who promoted them: the king him&s;elf was branded as an enemy to the hierarchy; and they be&s;tirred them&s;elves &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully in the election of members for the convocation, that they procured a very con&s;iderable majority. At their fir&s;t meeting, the friends of the comprehen&s;ion &s;cheme propo&s;ed Dr. Tillot&s;on clerk of the clo&s;et to his maje&s;ty as prolocutor; but the other party carried it in favour of Dr. Jane, who was counted the mo&s;t violent churchman in the whole a&s;&s;embly. In a Latin &s;peech to the bi&s;hop of London as pre&s;ident, he, in the name of the lower hou&s;e, a&s;&s;erted, that the liturgy of England needed no amendment, and concluded with the old declaration of the barons, <Q>&startq;Nolumus leges Angliae mutari.&endq;</Q> We will not &s;uffer the laws of England to be changed. The bi&s;hop, in his reply, exhorted them to moderation, charity, and indulgence, towards their brethren the di&s;&s;enters; and to make &s;uch abate|ments in things indifferent as might &s;erve to open a door of &s;alvation to mul|titudes of &s;traying chri&s;tians. His injunctions, however, produced no favour|able effect. The lower hou&s;e &s;eemed to be animated by a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition; and next day the pre&s;ident prorogued them, on pretence that the royal commi&s;&s;ion by which they were to act was defective, for want of being &s;ealed; and that a prorogation was nece&s;&s;ary, until that &s;anction &s;hould be obtained. In this in|terval, means were u&s;ed to mollify their noncompliant tempers; but all en|deavours proved ineffectual. When they met again, the earl of Nottingham delivered the king's commi&s;&s;ion to both hou&s;es, with a &s;peech of his own, and a me&s;&s;age from his maje&s;ty, importing, that he had &s;ummoned them out of a pious zeal to do every thing that might tend to the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of England, which &s;hould always enjoy his favour and protection. He exhorted them to lay a&s;ide all prejudice; to con&s;ider calmly and impartially whatever &s;hould be propo&s;ed: he a&s;&s;ured them he would offer nothing but what &s;hould be for the honour, peace, and advantage, of the prote&s;tant re|ligion in general, and particularly of the church of England.</P>

conference en&s;ued, and, after warm debates, they agreed upon a cold addre&s;s, which was accordingly pre&s;ented. The majority of the lower hou&s;e, far from taking any mea&s;ures in favour of di&s;&s;enters, converted all their attention to the relief of their nonjuring brethren. Zealous &s;peeches were made in behalf of the &s;u&s;pended bi&s;hops; and Dr. Jane propo&s;ed that &s;omething might be done to qualify them to &s;it in the convocation. This, however, was &s;uch a dangerous point as they would not venture to di&s;cu&s;s. Yet, rather than proceed upon the bu&s;ine&s;s for which they had been a&s;&s;embled, they began to take cogni|zance of &s;ome pamphlets lately publi&s;hed, which they conceived to be of dan|gerous con&s;equence to the chri&s;tian religion. The pre&s;ident and his party per|ceiving the di&s;po&s;ition of the hou&s;e, did not think proper to communicate any propo&s;al touching the intended reformation; and the king &s;uffered the &s;e&s;&s;ion to be di&s;continued by repeated prorogations.</P>

<P>The parliament meeting on the nineteenth day of October, the king, in a &s;peech of his own compo&s;ing, explained the nece&s;&s;ity of a pre&s;ent &s;upply to carry on the war; de&s;ired that they might be &s;peedy in their determinations on this &s;ubject; for the&s;e would in a great mea&s;ure influence the deliberations of the princes and &s;tates concerned in the war again&s;t France, as a general meeting of them was appointed to be held next month at the Hague, to &s;ettle the operations of the en&s;uing campaign. He concluded with recommending the di&s;patch of a bill of indemnity, that the minds of his &s;ubjects might be quieted; and that they might unanimou&s;ly concur in promoting the honour and welfare of the kingdom. As &s;everal inflammatory bills and di&s;putes, which had produced heats and animo&s;ities in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, were &s;till depend|ing, the king, after having con&s;ulted both hou&s;es, re&s;olved to put an end to tho&s;e di&s;putes by a prorogation. He accordingly went to the hou&s;e of lords, and prorogued the parliament till the twenty fir&s;t day of October, by the mouth of the new &s;peaker Sir Robert Atkins, the marquis of Hallifax having re|&s;igned that office. When they rea&s;&s;embled, the king referred them to his former &s;peech; then the commons unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to a&s;&s;i&s;t his maje&s;ty in reducing Ireland, and in joining with his allies abroad for a vigorous pro|&s;ecution of the war again&s;t France: for the&s;e purpo&s;es they voted a &s;upply of two millions.</P>

<P>During this &s;e&s;&s;ion the Whigs employed all their influence and in|trigues in ob&s;tructing the bill of indemnity, which they knew would open a door for favour and preferment to the oppo&s;ite party, which began to gain ground in the king's good graces. With this view they revived the pro&s;ecution of the &s;tate pri&s;oners. A committee was appointed to prepare a charge again&s;t Burton and Graham. The commons re&s;olved to impeach the earls of Peter|borough, Sali&s;bury, and Ca&s;tlemain, Sir Edward Hales, and Obadiah Walker, of high trea&s;on, for having been reconciled to the church of Rome, contrary to the laws of the realm. A bill was ordered to be brought in to declare the e&s;tate of the late lord chancellor Jeffries forfeited to the crown, and attaint his blood; but it met with &s;uch oppo&s;ition that the mea&s;ure was dropped: the hou&s;e however agreed, that the pecuniary penalties incurred by tho&s;e per&s;ons who had exerci&s;ed offices contrary to the laws again&s;t popi&s;h recu&s;ants, &s;hould be &s;peedily levied, and applied to the public &s;ervice.

was committed to the Tower; but, as no other evidence appeared again&s;t him than written letters, found in the fal&s;e bottom of a pewter bottle, they could not help con&s;enting to his being relea&s;ed upon bail, as they had lately re&s;olved that Algernoon Sidney had been unju&s;tly condemned, becau&s;e nothing but writings had been produced again&s;t him at his trial. The two hou&s;es con|curred in appointing a committee to enquire who were advi&s;ers and pro&s;ecutors in taking away the lives of lord Ru&s;&s;el, colonel Sydney, Sir Thomas Arm|&s;trong, alderman Corni&s;h, and others; and who were chiefly concerned in the arbitrary practices touching the writs of Quo Warranto, and the &s;urrender of charters. This inquiry was levelled at the marquis of Hallifax, who had concurred with the mini&s;try of Charles in all tho&s;e &s;everities; and, though no proof appeared upon which votes or addre&s;&s;es could be founded, that noble|man &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to withdraw him&s;elf from the admini&s;tration. He therefore re&s;igned the privy-&s;eal, which was put in commi&s;&s;ion, and re|conciled him&s;elf to the Tories, of whom he became the patron and pro|tector.</P>

<P>The commons likewi&s;e re&s;umed the examination of the mi&s;carriages in Ireland; and de&s;ired the king would appoint commi&s;&s;ioners to go over and inquire into the condition of the army in that kingdom. Schomberg under|&s;tanding that he had been blamed in the hou&s;e of commons for his inactivity, tran&s;mitted to the king a &s;atisfactory vindication of his own conduct; and it appeared that the mi&s;carriages in Ireland were wholly owing to John Shales purveyor-general to the army. The commons immediately pre&s;ented an ad|dre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, praying that Shales might be taken into cu&s;tody; that all his papers, accounts, and &s;tores, &s;hould be &s;ecured; and that duke Schomberg might be impowered to fill his place with a more able purveyor. The king gave them to under&s;tand, that he had already &s;ent orders to the ge|neral for that purpo&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, they in another petition reque&s;ted his maje&s;ty to name tho&s;e who had recommended Shales to his &s;ervice, as he had exerci&s;ed the &s;ame office under king James, and was &s;u&s;pected of trea&s;onable practices again&s;t the government. William declined gratifying their reque&s;t; but he afterwards &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e, de&s;iring them to recommend a certain number of commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;uperintend &s;uch provi&s;ions and prepara|tions as might be nece&s;&s;ary for that &s;ervice; as well as to nominate certain per&s;ons to go over and examine the &s;tate of the army in Ireland. The com|mons were &s;o mollified by this in&s;tance of his conde&s;cen&s;ion, that they left the whole affair to his own direction, and proceeded to examine other branches of mi&s;conduct. In&s;tances of mi&s;management appeared &s;o numerous and &s;o fla|grant, that they re&s;olved upon a &s;ub&s;equent addre&s;s, to explain the ill conduct and &s;ucce&s;s of his army and navy; to de&s;ire he would find out the authors of the&s;e mi&s;carriages, and for the future entru&s;t un&s;u&s;pected per&s;ons with the ma|nagement of affairs. They ordered the victuallers of the fleet to be taken into cu&s;tody, on &s;u&s;picion of having furni&s;hed the navy with unwhole&s;ome pro|vi&s;ions; and new commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed. Bitter reproaches were thrown out again&s;t the mini&s;try$ Mr. Hambden expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize that the admini&s;tration &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of tho&s;e very per&s;ons whom king James had employed when his affairs were de&s;perate, to treat with the prince of Orange; and moved that the king &s;hould be petitioned in an addre&s;s to remove &s;uch
<PB N="40" REF="430">
per&s;ons from his pre&s;ence and councils. This was a &s;troke aimed at the earl of Nottingham, who&s;e office of &s;ecretary Hambden de&s;ired to po&s;&s;e&s;s: but his motion was not &s;econded, the court-members ob&s;erving that James did not depute tho&s;e lords to the prince of Orange becau&s;e they were attached to his own intere&s;t, but for a very different rea&s;on, namely, that they were well known to di&s;approve of his mea&s;ures; and therefore would be the more agreeable to his highne&s;s. The hou&s;e, however, voted an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring that the authors of the mi&s;carriages might be brought to condign puni&s;hment.</P>

<P>In the &s;equel, the que&s;tion was propo&s;ed, Whether a placeman ought to have a $eat in the hou&s;e? And a very warm debate en&s;ued; but it was carried in the affirmative, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that by &s;uch exclu&s;ion the commonwealth would be deprived of &s;ome of the able&s;t &s;enators of the kingdom. But what chiefly irritated William again&s;t the Whigs, was their backwardne&s;s in pro|moting the public &s;ervice; and their di&s;regard of the earne&s;t de&s;ire he ex|pre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee his revenue &s;ettled for life. He &s;aid his title was no more than a pageant; and the wor&s;t of all governments was that of a king without trea&s;ure. Neverthele&s;s, they would not grant the civil li&s;t for a longer term than one year. They began to think there was &s;omething arbitrary in his di&s;po&s;ition. His &s;ullen behaviour in all probability fir&s;t infu&s;ed this opinion, which was &s;trengthened and confirmed by the in&s;inuations of his enemies. The Scots, who had come up to London to give an account of the proceed|ings in their parliament, were infected with the &s;ame notion. One Simp|&s;on, a pre&s;byterian of that country, whom the earl of Portland employed as a &s;py, had in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the confidence of Nevil Payne, an active and intelligent parti&s;an, and agen$ of king James; by which means he &s;upplied the earl with &s;uch intelligence as rai&s;ed him to &s;ome degree of credit with that mini&s;ter. This he u&s;ed in prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the earl again&s;t the king's be&s;t friends, and infu&s;ing jealou&s;ies which were &s;oon kindled into mutual di&s;tru&s;t and ani|mo&s;ity.</P>

<P>Sir James Montgomery, who had been a warm advocate for the revolution, received advice that the court &s;u&s;pected him and others of di&s;af|fection, and was employed in &s;eeking evidence by which they might be pro|&s;ecuted. They were equally alarmed and incen&s;ed at this intimation, and Payne &s;eized the opportunity of &s;educing them into a corre&s;pondence with the exiled king. They demanded the &s;ettlement of pre&s;bytery in Scotland, and actually engaged in a treaty for his re&s;toration. They reconciled them&s;elves to the duke of Queen&s;berry, and the other noblemen of the epi&s;copal party: they wrote to James for a &s;upply of money, arms, and ammunition, together with a reinforcement of three thou&s;and men from Dunkirk. Montgomery had acquired great intere&s;t among the Whigs of England, and this he em|ployed in animating them again&s;t the king and the mini&s;try. He repre&s;ented them as a &s;et of wicked men, who employed infamous &s;pies to en&s;nare and ruin the fa&s;t friends of the government; and found means to alienate them &s;o much from William, that they began to think in earne&s;t of recalling their bani&s;hed prince. The duke of Bolton and the earl of Monmouth were almo&s;t per&s;uaded into a con&s;piracy for this purpo&s;e: they &s;eemed to think James was now &s;o well convinced of his former errors, that they might tru&s;t him with|out &s;cruple. Montgomery and Payne were the chief managers of the &s;cheme;
<PB N="41" REF="440" MS="Y">
and they admitted Fergu&s;on into their councils, as a veteran in the arts of trea&s;on. In order to bla&s;t William's credit in the city, they circulated a report that James would grant a full indemnity, &s;eparate him&s;elf entirely from the French intere&s;t, and be contented with a &s;ecret connivance in favour of the roman catholics. Montgomery's brother a&s;&s;ured the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, that a treaty with king James was ab&s;olutely concluded, and an invitation &s;ub|&s;cribed by the whole cabal. He &s;aid this paper would be &s;ent to Ireland by the way of France, as the direct communication was difficult; and he pro|po&s;ed a method for &s;eizing it before it &s;hould be conveyed out of the kingdom. William&s;on, the &s;uppo&s;ed bearer of it, had obtained a pa&s;s for Flanders; and a me&s;&s;enger being &s;ent in pur&s;uit of him, &s;ecured his cloaths and portmanteau; but, after a very &s;trict examination, nothing appeared to ju&s;tify the intelli|gence. William&s;on had previou&s;ly delivered the papers to Simp&s;on, who hired a boat at Deal, and arrived in &s;afety at France. He returned with large a&s;&s;urances, and twelve thou&s;and pounds were remitted to the Scotti&s;h under|takers. Montgomery the informer, &s;eeing his intelligence fal&s;ified, lo&s;t his credit with the bi&s;hop, and dreading the re&s;entment of the other party, re|tired to the continent. The con&s;pirators loudly complained of the fal&s;e im|putations they had incurred. The pretended di&s;coveries were looked upon as fictions of the mini&s;try, and the king on this occa&s;ion &s;uffered greatly in the opinion of his &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>The Tories &s;till continued to carry on a &s;ecret negotiation with the court. They took advantage of the ill humour &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the king and the Whigs; and promi&s;ed large &s;upplies of money, provided this parlia|ment &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved, and another immediately convoked. The oppo&s;ite party being appri&s;ed of their intention, brought a bill into the hou&s;e of commons for re&s;toring corporations to their antient rights and privileges. They knew their own &s;trength at elections con&s;i&s;ted in the&s;e corporations; and they in&s;erted two additional &s;evere clau&s;es again&s;t tho&s;e who were in any &s;hape concerned in &s;urrendering charters. The whole power of the Tories was ex|erted again&s;t this clau&s;e; and now the Whigs vied with them in making court to his maje&s;ty, promi&s;ing to manife&s;t the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive obedience &s;hould this bill be enacted into a law. The &s;trength of the Tories was now become &s;o formidable in the hou&s;e, that they outvoted the other party, and the clau&s;es were rejected; but the bill pa&s;&s;ed in its original form. The lords debated upon the point, Whether a corporation could be forfeited or &s;urren|dered? Lord chief ju&s;tice Holt and two other judges declared their opinion in the a$firmative: the re&s;t thought otherwi&s;e, as no precedents could be pro|duced farther back than the reign of Henry VIII. when the abbies were &s;ur|rendered; and this in&s;tance &s;eemed too violent to authori&s;e &s;uch a mea&s;ure in a regular cour&s;e of admini&s;tration. The bill, however, pa&s;&s;ed by one voice only. Then both parties quickened their applications to the king, who found him&s;elf &s;o perplexed and di&s;tracted between two factions which he equally feared, that he re&s;olved to leave the government in the queen's hands, and retire to Holland. He communicated this de&s;ign to the marquis of Car|maerthen, the earl of Shrew&s;bury, and &s;ome other noblemen, who pre&s;&s;ed him to lay a&s;ide this re&s;olution, and even mingled tears in their remon|&s;trances.</P>

<P>He at length complied with their reque&s;t, and determined to fini&s;h the Iri&s;h war in per&s;on. This de&s;ign was far from being agreeable to the par|liament. His friends dreaded the climate of that country, which might prove fatal to his weak con&s;titution. The well-wi&s;hers of James were afraid of that prince's being h$rd pre&s;&s;ed, &s;hould William take the field again&s;t him in per&s;on: both hou&s;es therefore began to prepare an addre&s;s again&s;t this expedition. In order to prevent this remon&s;trance, the king went to the parliament, and formally &s;ignified his re&s;olution. After his &s;peech they were prorogued to the &s;econd day of April. On the &s;ixth day of February they were di&s;&s;olved by proclamation, and a new parliament was &s;ummoned to meet on the twentieth day of March. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the commons, in an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;ired that a revenue of fifty thou&s;and pounds might be &s;ettled upon the prince and prince&s;s of Denmark, out of the civil li&s;t; and his maje&s;ty gratified them in th$s particular; though the warmth and indu&s;try with which the friends of the prince&s;s exerted them&s;elves in promoting the &s;ettlement, produced a coldne&s;s and mi&s;under&s;tanding between the two &s;i&s;ters; and the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;grace of the earl of Marlborough was imputed to the part which his wife acted on the occa&s;ion. She was lady of the bed-chamber, and chief confi|dent to the prince&s;s, whom &s;he &s;trenuou&s;ly advi&s;ed to in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;ettle|ment, rather than depend upon the genero&s;ity of the king and queen.</P>

<P>About this period, general Ludlow, who at the re&s;toration had been excepted from the act of indemnity, as one of tho&s;e who &s;at in judg|ment upon Charles I. arrived in England, and offered his &s;ervice in reducing Ireland, where he had formerly commanded. Though a rigid republican, he was reputed a con&s;cientious man, and a good officer. He had received &s;ome encouragement to come over, and probably would have been employed, had not the commons interpo&s;ed. Sir Edward Seymour, who enjoyed by grant an e&s;tate in Wilt&s;hire, which had formerly belonged to Ludlow, began to be in pain for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He ob&s;erved in the hou&s;e, that the nation would be di&s;graced, &s;hould one of the parricides be &s;uffered to live in the kingdom. An addre&s;s was immediately pre&s;ented to the king, de&s;iring a proclamation might be i&s;&s;ued, promi&s;ing a reward for apprehending general Ludlow. This was accordingly publi&s;hed; but not before he had landed in Holland, from whence he returned to Vevay in Swi&s;&s;erland, where he wrote the memoirs of his life, and died after an exile of thirty years.</P>

<P>While king William fluctuated between two parties in England, his intere&s;t in Scotland had well nigh given way to a coalition between the original Jacobites, and Montgomery's party of di&s;contented pre&s;byterians. Colonel Can|non, who &s;ucceeded the vi&s;count Dundee in command, af$er having made &s;e|veral un&s;ucce&s;ful efforts in favour of the late king's intere&s;t, retired into Ireland; and the Highlanders cho&s;e Sir Hugh Cameron for their leader. Under him they renewed their incur$$ons with the better pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;$$ as &s;everal re|giments of the regular troops had been &s;ent to reinforce the army of Schom|berg. James a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with cloaths, arms, and ammunition, together with &s;ome officers, among&s;t whom was colonel Buchan, appointed to act as their chief commander This officer, at the head of fifteen hundred men, advanced into the &s;hire of Murray, in hope of being joined by other male|contents: but he was &s;urpri&s;ed and routed by Sir Thomas Living&s;tone, while
<PB N="43" REF="460">
major Fergu&s;on de&s;troyed the places they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the i&s;le of Mull; &s;o that the Highlanders were obliged to retire and conceal them&s;elves among their hills and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es. The friends of James de&s;pairing of doing any thing effectual for his &s;ervice in the field, converted all their attention to the pro|ceedings in parliament, where they imagined their intere&s;t was much &s;tronger than it appeared to be upon trial. They took the oaths without he&s;itation, and hoped, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their new allies, to embroil the government in &s;uch a manner that the majority of the people would declare for a re&s;tora|tion. But the views of the&s;e new cemented parties were altogether incompati|ble; and their principles diametrically oppo&s;ite. Notwith&s;tanding their con|currence in parliament, the earl of Melvil procured a &s;mall majority. The op|po&s;ition was immediately di&s;couraged; &s;ome individuals retracted, rather than fall with a &s;inking cau&s;e; and mutual jealou&s;ies began to prevail. The leaders of the coalition treated &s;eparately with king James; made incon&s;i&s;tent demands; reciprocally concealed their negotiations; in a word, they di&s;tru&s;ted and hated one another with the mo&s;t implacable re&s;entment.</P>

<P>The earls of Argyle, Anandale, and Braidalbin, withdrew from their councils, and repaired to England. Montgomery, terrified at their defection, went privately to London, after he had hinted &s;omething of the plot to Melvil, and &s;ollicited a pa&s;s from the queen, which was refu&s;ed. Anandale having re|ceived information that Montgomery had di&s;clo&s;ed all the particulars of the ne|gotiation, threw him&s;elf upon the queen's mercy, and di&s;covered all he knew of the con&s;piracy. As he had not treated with any of the malecontents in Eng|land, they remained &s;ecure from his evidence; but, he informed again&s;t Nevil Payne, who had been &s;ent down as their agent to Scotland, where he now re&s;ided. He was immediately apprehended by the council of that kingdom, in con&s;e|quence of a letter from the earl of Nottingham; and twice put to the torture, which he re&s;olutely bore without di&s;covering his employers. Montgomery &s;till ab&s;conded in London, &s;oliciting a pardon; but, finding he could not obtain it, except on condition of making a full di&s;covery, he abandoned his country and cho&s;e to die in exile, rather than betray his confederates. This di&s;union of the con&s;pirators and di&s;covery of the plot, left the earl of Melvil in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a greater majority; though even this he was fain to &s;ecure by over&s;training his in&s;tructions in the articles of patronage, and the &s;upremacy of the crown, which he yielded up to the fury of the fanatic pre&s;byterians, contrary to the intention of king William. In lieu of the&s;e, however, they indulged him with the tax of chimney or hearth-money; and a te&s;t to be impo&s;ed upon all per&s;ons in office and parliament, declaring William and Mary their lawful &s;overeigns, and re|nouncing the pretended title of king James. All the laws in favour of epi&s;co|pacy were repealed. Three&s;core of the pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, who had been ejected at the re&s;toration, were &s;till alive; and the&s;e the parliament declared the only &s;ound part of the church. The government of it was lodged in their hands; and they were impowered to admit &s;uch as they &s;hould think proper, to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A few furious fanatics being thus a&s;&s;ociated, proceeded with ungovernable violence to per&s;ecute the epi&s;copal party, exerci&s;ing the very &s;ame tyranny again&s;t which they them&s;elves had &s;o loudly exclaimed.</P>

<P>While the pre&s;byterian intere&s;t thus triumphed in Scotland, the two parties that divided England, employed their whole influence and attention

in managing the elections for a new parliament; and the Tories obtained the victory. The king &s;eemed gradually falling into the arms of this party. They complained of their having been totally excluded from the lieutenancy of London at the king's acce&s;&s;ion to the crown; and now a con&s;iderable num|ber of the mo&s;t violent Tories in the city was admitted into the commi&s;&s;ion by the intere&s;t and addre&s;s of the bi&s;hop of London, the marquis of Carmaerthen, and the earl of Nottingham. To gratify that party, the earls of Monmouth and Warrington were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their employments; nay, when the parliament<NOTE PLACE="marg">B$$net. Rel$$rres. Kennet. $word$. $word$.</NOTE> met on the twentieth day of March, the commons cho&s;e for their &s;peaker Sir John Trevor, a violent parti&s;an of that faction, who had been created ma&s;ter of the rolls by the late king. He was a bold artful man, and undertook to pro|cure a majority to be at the devotion of the court, provided he &s;hould be &s;upplied with the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums for the purpo&s;es of corruption. William find|ing there was no other way of maintaining his admini&s;tration in peace, thought proper to countenance the practice of purcha&s;ing votes; and appointed Trevor<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1690.</NOTE> fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the great &s;eal. In his &s;peech to the new parliament, he gave them to under&s;tand, that he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution of going in per|&s;on to Ireland. He de&s;ired they would make a &s;ettlement of the revenue, or e&s;tabli&s;h it for the pre&s;ent, as a fund of credit, upon which the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums for the &s;ervice of the government might be immediately advanced: he &s;ignified his intention of &s;ending to them an act of grace, with a few exceptions, that he might manife&s;t his readine&s;s to extend his protection to all his &s;ubjects; and leave no colour of excu&s;e for rai&s;ing di&s;turbances in his ab&s;ence, as he knew how bu&s;y &s;ome ill affected men were in their endeavours to alter the e&s;tabli&s;hed government: he recommended an union with Scotland, the parliament of which had appointed commi&s;&s;ioners for that purpo&s;e: he told them he &s;hould leave the admini&s;tration in the hands of the queen; and de&s;ired they would prepare an act to confirm her authority: he exhorted them to di&s;patch the bu&s;ine&s;s for which they were a&s;&s;embled; to avoid debates; and expre&s;&s;ed his hope that they &s;hould &s;oon meet again to fini&s;h what might be now left imperfect.</P>

<P>The commons, in compliance with his reque&s;t, voted a &s;upply of twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds, one million of that &s;um to be rai&s;ed by a clau&s;e of credit in the revenue-bills; but, he could not prevail upon them to &s;ettle the revenue for life. They granted, however, the hereditary exci&s;e for that term; but the cu&s;toms for four years only. They con&s;idered this &s;hort term as the be&s;t &s;ecurity the kingdom could have for frequent parliaments; though this precaution was not at all agreeable to their &s;overeign. A poll-bill was likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed; other &s;upplies were granted; and both parties &s;eemed to court his maje&s;ty by advancing money on tho&s;e funds of credit. The Whigs however had another battery in re&s;erve. They produced, in the upper hou&s;e, a bill for recognizing their maje&s;ties as the rightful and lawful &s;overeigns of the&s;e realms; and for declaring all the acts of the la&s;t parliament to be good and valid. The Tories were now reduced to a very perplexed &s;ituation. They could not oppo&s;e the bill without hazarding the intere&s;t they had &s;o lately ac|quired, nor a&s;&s;ent to it without &s;olemnly renouncing their former arguments and di&s;tinctions. They made no great objections to the fir&s;t part, and even propo&s;ed to enact, That tho&s;e &s;hould be deemed good laws for the time to come; but they refu&s;ed to declare them valid for that which was pa&s;t. After
<PB N="45" REF="480">
a long debate, the bill was committed; yet the Whigs lo&s;t their majority on the report: neverthele&s;s, the bill was recovered, and pa&s;&s;ed with &s;ome alteration in the words, in con&s;equence of a nervous &s;pirited prote&s;t, &s;igned Bolton, Mac|clesfield, Stamford, Newport, Bedford, Herbert, Suffolk, Monmouth, Dela|mere, and Oxford. The whole intere&s;t of the court was thrown into the &s;cale with this bill, before it would preponderate again&s;t the Tories, the chiefs of whom, with the earl of Nottingham at their head, prote&s;ted in their turn. The &s;ame party in the hou&s;e of commons were determined upon a vigorous oppo|&s;ition; and in the mean time &s;ome trifling objections were made that it might be committed for amendment; but their de&s;ign was prematurely di&s;covered by one of their faction, who chanced to que&s;tion the legality of the convention, as it was not &s;ummoned by the king's writ. This in&s;inuation was an&s;wered by Somers the &s;olicitor-general, who ob&s;erved, that if it was not a legal parliament, they who were then met, and who had taken the oaths enacted by the parlia|ment, were guilty of high-trea&s;on: the laws repealed by it were &s;till in force; it was their duty therefore to return to king James; and all concerned in col|lecting and paying the money levied by the acts of that parliament, were highly criminal. The Tories were &s;o &s;truck with the&s;e arguments, that the bill pa&s;&s;ed without further oppo&s;ition, and immediately received the royal a&s;&s;ent. Thus the &s;ettlement was confirmed by tho&s;e very people who had &s;o loudly exclaimed again&s;t it as illegal; but, the Whigs, with all their management, would not have gained their point, had not the court been intere&s;ted in the di&s;pute.</P>

<P>There was another violent conte&s;t between the two parties, on the import of a bill requiring all &s;ubjects in office to abjure king James, on pain of impri&s;onment. Though the clergy were at fir&s;t exempted from this te&s;t, the main body of the Tories oppo&s;ed it with great vehemence, while the Whigs, under countenance of the mini&s;try, &s;upported it with equal vigour. It pro|duced long and violent debates; and the two factions &s;eemed pretty equally ballanced. At length, the Tories repre&s;ented to the king, that a great deal of precious time would be lo&s;t in fruitle&s;s altercation: that tho&s;e who declared again&s;t the bill would grow &s;ullen and intractable, &s;o as to oppo&s;e every other motion that might be made for the king's &s;ervice: that, in ca&s;e of its being car|ried, his maje&s;ty mu&s;t fall again into the hands of the Whigs, who would re|new their former practices again&s;t the prerogative; and many individuals, who were now either well affected to him, or at lea&s;t neutral, would become Jaco|bites from re&s;entment. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions had &s;uch weight with king William, that he &s;ent an intimation to the commons, de&s;iring they would drop the de|bate, and proceed to matters that were more pre&s;&s;ing. The Whigs in general were di&s;gu&s;ted at this interpo&s;ition; and the earl of Shrew&s;bury, who had inter|e&s;ted him&s;elf warmly in behalf of the bill, re&s;ented it &s;o deeply, that he in&s;i&s;ted on re&s;igning his office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate. The king, who revered his talents and integrity, employed Dr. Tillot&s;on and others, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have credit with the earl, to di&s;&s;uade him from quitting his employment; but, he continued deaf to all their remon&s;trances, and would not even comply with the reque&s;t of his maje&s;ty, who pre&s;&s;ed him to keep the &s;eals until he &s;hould re|turn from Ireland. Long debates were likewi&s;e managed in the hou&s;e of lords, upon the bill of abjuration, or rather an oath of &s;pecial fidelity to William, in oppo&s;ition to James. The Tories profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves willing to enter into a
<PB N="46" REF="490">
negative engagement again&s;t the late king and his adherents; but they oppo&s;ed the oath of abjuration with all their might; and the hou&s;e was &s;o equally di|vided that neither &s;ide was willing to hazard a deci&s;ion: &s;o that all the fruits of their debates was a prolongation of the &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>An act was prepared for inve&s;ting the queen with the admini&s;tra|tion during the king's ab&s;ence; another for rever&s;ing the judgment on a Quo Warranto again&s;t the city of London, and re&s;toring it to its antient rights and privileges; and at length, the bill of indemnity &s;o cordially recommended by the king, pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following per&s;ons were excepted from the benefit of this act. William, marquis of Powis; Theophilus, earl of Huntingdon; Ro|bert, earl of Sunderland; John, earl of Melfort; Roger, earl of Ca&s;tlemain; Nathaniel, lord-bi&s;hop of Durham; Thomas, lord-bi&s;hop of St. David's; Henry, lord Dover; lord Thomas Howard, Sir Edward Hales, Sir Francis Withers, Sir Edward Lutwych, Sir Thomas Jenner, Sir Nicholas But|ler, Sir William Herbert, Sir Richard Holloway, Sir Richard Heath, Sir Roger L'E&s;trange, Willi|am Molineux, Thomas Tynde&s;ley, colonel Town|ly, colonel Lundy, Robert Brent, Edward Mor|gan, Philip Burton, Richard Graham, Edward Petre, Obadiah Walker, Marthew Crone, and George lord Jeffries decea&s;ed.</NOTE>. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of May, the king clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;hort &s;peech, in which he thanked them for the &s;upplies they had granted; and recommended to them a punctual di&s;charge of their duties in their re&s;pective counties, that the peace of the nation might not be interrupted in his ab&s;ence. The hou&s;es were adjourned to the &s;eventh day of July; then the parliament was prorogu$d and adjourned &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. As a further &s;ecurity for the peace of the kingdom, the deputy-lieutenants were authori&s;ed to rai&s;e the militia in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. All papi&s;ts were prohibited to &s;tir above five miles from their re&s;pective places of abode: a proclamation was publi&s;hed for appre|hending certain di&s;affected per&s;ons; Sir John Cochran and Fergu&s;on were ac|tually arre&s;ted on &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable practices. On the fourth day of June the king &s;et out for Ireland, attended by prince George of Denmark, the duke of Ormond, the earls of Oxford, Scarborough, Manche&s;ter, and many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction: on the fourteenth day of the month he landed at Carrickfergus, from whence he immediately proceeded to Belfa&s;t, where he was met by the duke of Schomberg, the prince of Wurtemberg, major-general Kirke, and other officers. By this time colonel Wole&s;ey, at the head of a thou|&s;and men, had defeated a &s;trong detachment of the enemy near Belturbat; Sir John Lanier had taken Bedloe-ca&s;tle, and that of Charlemont, a &s;trong po&s;t of great importance, together with Balingargy near Cavan, had been reduced. King William having repo&s;ed him&s;elf for two or three days at Belfa&s;t, vi&s;ited the duke's head-quarters at Li&s;burne; and advancing to Hil&s;borough, pub|li&s;hed an order again&s;t pre&s;&s;ing hor&s;es, and committing violence on the country|people. When &s;ome of his general-officers propo&s;ed cautious mea&s;ures, he de|clared he did not come to Ireland to let the gra&s;s grow under his feet. He ordered the army to encamp and be reviewed at Loughbrilland, where he found it amounted to &s;ix and thirty thou&s;and effective men well appointed. Then he marched to Dundalk; and afterwards advanced to Ardee, which the enemy had ju&s;t abandoned.</P>

<P>King James tru&s;ted &s;o much to the di&s;putes in the Engli&s;h parlia|ment, that he did not believe his &s;on-in-law would be able to quit that king|dom; and he had been &s;ix days in Ireland before he received intimation of his
<PB N="47" REF="500">
arrival. This was no &s;ooner known, than he left Dublin under the guard of the militia commanded by Lutterel, and with a reinforcement of &s;ix thou&s;and infantry which he had lately received from France, joined the re&s;t of his forces, which now almo&s;t equalled William's army in number, exclu&s;ive of about fif|teen thou&s;and men who remained in different garri&s;ons. He occupied a very advantageous po&s;t on the bank of the Boyne, and contrary to the advice of his general officers, re&s;olved to &s;tand battle. They propo&s;ed to &s;trengthen their garri&s;ons, and retire to the Shannon, to wait the effect of the operations at &s;ea. Lewis had promi&s;ed to equip a powerful armament again&s;t the Engli&s;h fleet, and &s;end over a great number of &s;mall frigates to de&s;troy William's tran&s;ports, as &s;oon as their convoy &s;hould be returned to England. The execution of this &s;cheme was not at all difficult, and mu&s;t have proved fatal to the Engli&s;h army; for, their &s;tores and ammunition were &s;till on board; the &s;hips &s;ailed along the coa&s;t as the troops advanced in their march; and there was not one &s;ecure har|bour into which they could retire on any emergency. James, however, was bent upon hazarding an engagement; and expre&s;&s;ed uncommon confidence and alacrity. Be&s;ides the river, which was deep, his front was &s;ecured by a mora&s;s and a ri&s;ing-ground: &s;o that the Engli&s;h army could not attack him without manife&s;t di&s;advantage.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>King William marched up to the oppo&s;ite bank of the river, and as he reconnoitred their &s;ituation, was expo&s;ed to the fire of &s;ome field-pieces, which the enemy purpo&s;ely planted again&s;t his per&s;on. They killed a man and two hor&s;es clo&s;e by him; and the &s;econd bullet rebounding from the earth, grazed upon his right &s;houlder, &s;o as to carry off part of his cloaths and skin, and produce a con&s;iderable contu&s;ion. This accident, which he bore without the lea&s;t emotion, created &s;ome confu&s;ion among his attendants, which the enemy perceiving, concluded he was killed, and &s;houted aloud in token of their joy. Their whole camp re&s;ounded with acclamation; and &s;everal &s;quadrons of their hor&s;e were drawn down towards the river, as if they had intended to pa&s;s it im|mediately and attack the Engli&s;h army. The report was in&s;tantly communi|cated from place to place, until it reached Dublin, from thence it was conveyed to Paris, where, contrary to the cu&s;tom of the French court, the people were encouraged to celebrate the event with bonfires and illuminations. William rode along the line, to &s;hew him&s;elf to the army after this narrow e&s;cape. At night he called a council of war; and declared his re&s;olution to attack the enemy in the morning. Schomberg at fir&s;t oppo&s;ed this de&s;ign; but finding the king determined, he advi&s;ed that a &s;trong detachment of hor&s;e and foot &s;hould that night pa&s;s the Boyne at Slane-bridge, and take po&s;t between the enemy and the pa&s;s of Duleck, that the action might be the more deci&s;ive. This coun&s;el being rejected, the king determined that early in the morning, lieutenant-general Douglas, with the right wing of infantry, and young Schom|berg, with the hor&s;e, &s;hould pa&s;s at Slane-bridge, while the main body of foot &s;hould force their pa&s;&s;age at Old-bridge, and the left at certain fords between the enemy's camp and Drogheda. The duke perceiving his advice was not re|li&s;hed by the Dutch generals, retired to his tent, where the order of battle being brought to him, he received it with an air of di&s;content, &s;aying, it was the fir&s;t that had ever been &s;ent him in that manner. The proper di&s;po&s;itions being made, William rode quite through the army by torch-light, and then retired to
<PB N="48" REF="510">
his tent, after having given order for the &s;oldiers to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the enemy by wearing green boughs in their hats during the action.</P>

<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning, general Douglas, with young Schom|berg, the earl of Portland and Overkirk, marched towards Slane-bridge, and pa&s;&s;ed the river with very little oppo&s;ition. When they reached the farther bank, they perceived the enemy drawn up in two lines, to a con&s;iderable number of hor&s;e and foot, with a mora&s;s in their front; &s;o that Douglas was obliged to wait for a reinforcement. This being arrived, the infantry were led on to the charge through the mora&s;s, while count Schomberg rode round it with his cavalry, to attack the enemy in flank. The Iri&s;h, in&s;tead of waiting the a&s;&s;ault, faced about and retreated towards Duleck with &s;ome precipitation; yet not &s;o fa&s;t, but that Schomberg fell in among their rear, and did con&s;iderable execution. King James, however, &s;oon reinforced his left wing from the center; and the count was in his turn obliged to &s;end for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At this juncture, king William's main body, con&s;i&s;ting of the Dutch guards, the French regiments, and &s;ome battalions of Engli&s;h, pa&s;&s;ed the river, which was wai&s;t high, under a general di&s;charge of artillery. King James had imprudently removed his cannon from the other &s;ide; but, he had po&s;ted a &s;trong body of mu&s;queteers along the bank, behind hedges, hou&s;es, and &s;ome works rai&s;ed for the occa&s;ion. They poured in a clo&s;e fire upon the Engli&s;h troops before they reached the &s;hore; but it produced very little effect: then the Iri&s;h gave way; and &s;ome battalions landed without farther oppo&s;ition. Yet, before they could form, they were charged with great impetuo&s;ity by a &s;quadron of the enemy's hor&s;e; and a con|&s;iderable body of their cavalry and foot, commanded by general Hamilton, advanced from behind &s;ome little hillocks, to attack tho&s;e that were landed, as well as to prevent the re&s;t from reaching the &s;hore. His infantry turned their backs and fled immediately; but, the hor&s;e charged with incredible &s;ury, both upon the bank and in the river, &s;o as to put the unformed regiments in confu|&s;ion. Then the duke of Schomberg pa&s;&s;ing the river in per&s;on, put him&s;elf at the head of the French prote&s;tants, and pointing to the enemy, <Q>&startq;Gentlemen (&s;aid he) tho&s;e are your per&s;ecutors;&endq;</Q> with the&s;e words he advanced to the attack, where he him&s;elf &s;u&s;tained a violent on&s;et from a party of the Iri&s;h hor&s;e which had broke through one of the regiments, and were now on their return. They were mi&s;taken for Engli&s;h, and allowed to gallop up to the duke, who received two &s;evere wounds in the head; but, the French regiments being now &s;en&s;ible of their mi&s;take, ra&s;hly threw in their fire upon the Iri&s;h while they were engaged with the duke; and in&s;tead of &s;aving, &s;hot him dead upon the &s;pot. The fate of this general had well nigh proved fatal to the Engli&s;h army, which was immediately involved in tumult and di&s;order; while the infantry of king James rallied and returned to their po&s;ts with a face of re&s;olution. They were ju&s;t ready to fall upon the center, when king William having pa&s;&s;ed with the left wing, compo&s;ed of the Dani&s;h, Dutch, and Inniskillin hor&s;e, advanced to attack them on the right. They were &s;truck with &s;uch a pannic at his appear|ance, that they made a &s;udden halt, and then facing about, retreated to the vil|lage of Dunore. There they made &s;uch a vigorous &s;tand, that the Dutch and Dani&s;h hor&s;e, though headed by the king in per&s;on, recoiled. Even the Inni&s;|killiners gave way; and that whole wing would have been routed, had not a detachment of dragoons belonging to the regiments of Cunningham and Le|vi&s;on,
<PB N="49" REF="520">
di&s;mounted, and lined the hedges on each &s;ide of the defile through which the fugitives were driven. There they did &s;uch execution upon the pur|&s;uers as &s;oon checked their ardour. The hor&s;e which were broken, had now time to rally, and returning to the charge, drove the enemy before them in their turn. In this action general Hamilton, who had been the life and &s;oul of the Iri&s;h during the whole engagement, was wounded and taken; an inci|dent which di&s;couraged them to &s;uch a degree, that they made no further ef|forts to retrieve the advantage they had lo&s;t. He was immediately brought to the king, who asked him if he thought the Iri&s;h would make any further re|&s;i&s;tance? and he replied, <Q>&startq;Upon my honour, I believe they will; for, they have &s;till a good body of hor&s;e intire.&endq;</Q> William eying him with a look of di&s;dain, repeated "Your honour! your honour!" but took no other notice of his hav|ing acted contrary to his engagement, when he was permitted to go to Ireland, on promi&s;e of per&s;uading Tyrconnel to &s;ubmit to the new government. The Iri&s;h now abandoned the field with precipitation; but, the French and Swi&s;s troops that acted as their auxiliaries, under Lauzun, retreated in good order, after having maintained the battle for &s;ome time with intrepidity and per&s;eve|rance. As king William did not think proper to pur&s;ue the enemy, the car|nage was not great.</P>

<P>The Iri&s;h lo&s;t about fifteen hundred men, and the Engli&s;h about one third of that number; tho' the victory was dearly purcha&s;ed, con&s;idering the death of the gallant duke of Schomberg, who fell in the eighty-&s;econd year of his age, after having rivalled the be&s;t generals of the age in military reputation. He was de&s;cended of a noble family in the Palatinate, and his mother was an Engli&s;hwoman, daughter of lord Dudley. Being obliged to leave his country on account of the troubles by which it was agitated, he commenced a &s;oldier of fortune, and &s;erved &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the armies of Holland, England, France, Portugal, and Brandenburgh. He attained to the dignities of marechal in France, grandee in Portugal, generali&s;&s;imo in Pru&s;&s;ia, and duke in England. He profe&s;&s;ed the prote&s;tant religion; was courteous and humble in his deport|ment, cool, penetrating, re&s;olute, and &s;agacious; nor was his probity inferior to his courage. This battle likewi&s;e proved fatal to the brave Caillemote, who had followed the duke's fortunes, and commanded one of the prote&s;tant regi|ments. After having received a mortal wound, he was carried back through the river by four &s;oldiers; and though almo&s;t in the agonies of death, he with a chearful countenance encouraged tho&s;e who were cro&s;&s;ing to do their duty, exclaiming, <Q>&startq;A la gloire mes enfans; a la gloire! To glory, my lads; to glory!&endq;</Q> The third remarkable per&s;on who lo&s;t his life on this occa&s;ion, was Walker the clergyman, who had &s;o valiantly defended Londonderry again&s;t the whole army of king James. He had been very graciou&s;ly received by king William, who gratified him with a reward of five thou&s;and pounds, and a pro|mi&s;e of further favour: but, his military genius &s;till predominating, he attended his royal patron in this battle; and being &s;hot in the belly, died in a few mi|nutes. The per&s;ons of di&s;tinction who fell on the other &s;ide, were the lords Dongan and Carlingford, Sir Neile O Neile, and the marquis of Hocquincourt. James him&s;elf &s;tood aloof during the action, on the hill of Dunmore, &s;urrounded with &s;ome &s;quadrons of hor&s;e; and &s;eeing victory declare again&s;t him, retired to Dublin, without having made the lea&s;t effort to rea&s;&s;emble his broken forces.

<P>King James no &s;ooner arrived at Dublin, than he a&s;&s;embled the mag$&s;trat$s and coun$$l of the city, and in a &s;hort &s;peech re&s;igned them to the $$rtune of the victor. He complained of the cowardice of the Iri&s;h; &s;ignified $word$ $word$ of leaving the kingdom immediately; forbad them, on their allegi|an$$$ to b$rn of plunder the city after his departure; and a&s;&s;ured them, that tho' he $$s obliged to yield to force, he would never cea&s;e to labour for their de|liverance. Next day he &s;et out for Waterford, attended by the duke of Ber|wick, Tyrconnel$ and the marquis of Powis. He ordered all the bridges to be broken down behind him; and embarked in a ve&s;&s;el which had been prepared for his reception. At &s;ea he fell in with the French &s;quadron, commanded by the &s;ieur de Foran, who per&s;uaded him to go on board one of his frigates, which was a prime &s;ai$or. In this he was &s;afely conveyed to France; and returned to the place of his former re&s;idence at St. Germain's. He had no &s;ooner quitted Dublin, than it was al&s;o abandoned by all the papi&s;ts. The prote&s;tants imme|diately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the arms belonging to the militia, under the conduct of the bi&s;hops of Meath and Limerick. A committee was formed to take charge of the admini&s;tration; and an account of the&s;e tran&s;actions was tran&s;|mitted to king William, together with a petition that he would honour the city with his pre&s;ence.</P>

<P>On the morning after the battle of the Boyne, William &s;ent a detachment of hor&s;e and foot$ under the command of Mr. Melionere, to Droghe|da, the governor of which &s;urrendered the place without oppo&s;ition. The king, at the head of the army, began his march for Dublin, and halted the fir&s;t night at Bally$Breghan, where having received advice of the enemy's retreat from the capital, he &s;ent the duke of Ormond, with a body of hor&s;e, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The&s;e were immediately followed by the Dutch guards, who &s;ecured the ca&s;tle. In a few days the king encamped at Finglas, in the neighbourhood of Dublin, where he was vi&s;ited by the bi&s;hops of Meath and Limerick, at the head of the prote&s;tant clergy, whom he a&s;&s;ured of his favour and protection. Then he pub|li&s;hed a declaration of pardon to all the common people who had &s;erved again&s;t him$ provided they &s;hould return to their dwellings, and &s;urrender their arms by the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t. Tho&s;e that rented lands of popi&s;h proprietors who had been concerned in the rebe$l$on, were required to retain their rents in their own hands, until they &s;hould have notice from the commi&s;&s;ioners of the revenue, to whom they might be payed. The de&s;perate leaders of the rebellion, who had violated the laws of the kingdom, called in the French, authori&s;ed the depre|dat$ons which had been committed upon prote&s;tants, and rejected the pardon offered to them on the king's fir&s;t proclamation, were left to the event of war, un$e&s;s by evident demon&s;trations of repentance they &s;hould de&s;erve mercy, which would never be refu&s;ed to tho&s;e that were truly penitent. The next &s;tep $aken by king William$ was to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, reducing the bra&s;s money
<PB N="51" REF="540">
to nearly its intrin&s;ic value. In the mean time, the principal officers in the army of James, after having &s;een him embark at Waterford, returned to their troops, determined to pro&s;ecute the war as long as they could be &s;upplied with means to &s;upport their operations.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the queen, as regent, found her&s;elf &s;ur|rounded with numberle&s;s cares and perplexities. Her council was pretty equally divided into Whigs and Tories, who did not always act with unanimity. She was di&s;tracted between her apprehen&s;ions for her father's &s;afety and her hu&s;|band's life: &s;he was threatened with an inva&s;ion by the French from abroad, and with an in&s;urrection by the Jacobites at home. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he di&s;|gui&s;ed her fears, and behaved with equal prudence and fortitude. Advice be|ing received that a fleet was ready to &s;ail from Bre&s;t, lord Torrington hoi&s;ted his flag in the Downs, and &s;ailed round to St. Helen's, in order to a&s;&s;emble &s;uch a number of &s;hips as would enable him to give them battle. The enemy being di&s;covered off Plymouth, on the twentieth day of June, the Engli&s;h admiral, reinforced with a Dutch &s;quadron, put to &s;ea with a view to intercept them at the back of the I&s;le of Wight, &s;hould they pre&s;ume to &s;ail up the channel. Not that he thought him&s;elf &s;trong enough to cope with them in battle; for their fleet con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy-eight &s;hips of war, and two and twenty fire&s;hips; whereas, the combined &s;quadrons of England and Holland did not exceed &s;ix and fifty; but, he had received orders to hazard an engagement, if he thought it might be done with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. After the ho&s;tile fleets had continued five days in &s;ight of each other, lord Torrington bore down upon the enemy off Beachy-head, on the thirtieth day of June at day-break. The Dutch &s;quadron which compo&s;ed the van, began the engagement about nine in the morning; in about half an hour the blue divi&s;ion of the Engli&s;h were clo&s;e en|gaged with the rear of the French; but, the red, which formed the center, under the command of Torrington in per&s;on, did not fill the line till ten o'clock; &s;o that the Dutch were almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the enemy; and though they fought with great valour, &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage. At length, the admiral's divi|&s;ion drove between them and the French; and in that &s;ituation the fleet an|chored about five in the afternoon, when the action was interrupted by a calm. The Dutch had &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely, that he thought it would be imprudent to renew the battle: he therefore weighed anchor in the night, and with the tide of f$ood retired to the ea&s;tward. The next day the di&s;abled &s;hips were de&s;troyed, that they might not be retarded in their retreat. They were pur&s;ued as far as Rye; and an Engli&s;h &s;hip of &s;eventy guns being &s;tranded near Winchel&s;ea, was &s;et on fire, and de&s;erted, by the captain's command. A Dutch &s;hip of &s;ixty|four guns met with the &s;ame accident, and &s;ome French frigates attempted to burn her; but, the captain defended her &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that they were obliged to d$&s;i&s;t$ and he afterwards found means to carry her &s;afe to Holland. In this engagement the Engli&s;h lo&s;t two &s;hips, two &s;ea-captains, and about four hundred men; but, the Dutch were more unfortunate. Six of their great &s;hips were de&s;troyed. Dick and Brackel rear-admirals, were &s;lain, together with a gr$at number of inferior officers and &s;eamen. Torrington retreated without furt$er interruption into the mouth of the Thames; and having taken precau|t$ons again&s;t any attempts of the enemy in that quarter, returned to London, the inhabitants of which were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation.</P>

<P>The government was infected with the &s;ame panic. The mini&s;|try pretended to believe that the French acted in concert with the malecontents of the na&s;ion; that in&s;urrections in different parts of the kingdom had been projected by the Jacobites; and that there would be a general revolt in Scot|land. The&s;e infinuations were circulated by the court-agents, in order to ju&s;|tify, in the opinion of the public, the mea&s;ures that were deemed nece&s;&s;ary at this juncture; and they produced the de&s;ired effect. The apprehen&s;ions, thus artfully rai&s;ed among the people, inflamed their aver&s;ion to nonjurors and Jaco|$$$es. Addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented to the queen, by the Corni&s;h tinners, the lieu|tenancy of Middle&s;ex, and by the mayor, aldermen, and lieutenancy of Lon|don, filled with profe&s;&s;ions of loyalty, and promi&s;es of &s;upporting their maje&s;|ties as their lawful &s;overeigns, again&s;t all oppo&s;ition. The queen, at this cri&s;is, exhibited remarkable proofs of courage, activity, and di&s;cretion. She i&s;&s;ued cut proper orders and directions for putting the nation in a po&s;ture of defence, as well as for refitting and augmenting the fleet: &s;he took mea&s;ures for appea&s;|ing the re&s;entment of the &s;tates-general, who exclaimed again&s;t the earl of Tor|rington for his behaviour in the late action. He was deprived of his com|mand, and &s;ent pri&s;oner to the Tower; and commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed to exa|mine the particular circum&s;tances of his conduct. A camp was formed in the neighbourhood of Torbay, where the French &s;eemed to threaten a de&s;cent. Their fleet, which lay at anchor in the bay, cannonaded a &s;mall village called Tingmouth$ About a thou&s;and of their men landed without oppo&s;ition, &s;et fire to the place, and burned a few coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;els: then they reimbarked, and returned to Bre&s;t; &s;o vain of this atchievement, that they publi&s;hed a pompous account of their inva&s;ion. Some of the Whig parti&s;ans publi&s;hed pamphlets, and diffu&s;ed re|ports, implying, that the &s;u&s;pended bi&s;hops were concerned in the con&s;piracy again&s;t the government; and the&s;e arts proved &s;o inflammatory among the com|mon people, that the prelates thought it nece&s;&s;ary to print a paper, in which they a&s;&s;erted their innocence in the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations. The court &s;eems to have harboured no &s;u&s;picion again&s;t them; otherwi&s;e they would not have e&s;|caped impri&s;onment, when the queen publi&s;hed a proclamation for apprehend|ing the carls of Litchfield, Ayle&s;bury, and Ca&s;tlemain, vi&s;count Pre&s;ton, the lords Montgomery and Bella$is, Sir Edward Hales, Sir Robert Tharold, Sir Robert Hamilton, Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe, colonel Edward Sackville, and &s;ome other officers, accu&s;ed of having con&s;pired with other di&s;affected per&s;ons, to di&s;turb and de&s;troy the government; and of a de&s;ign to concur with her maje&s;ty's enemies in the intended inva&s;ion. The earl of Torrington continued a pri&s;oner in the Tower till next &s;e&s;&s;ion, when he was brought into the hou&s;e of commons; and made a &s;peech in his own defence. His ca&s;e produced long debates in the upper hou&s;e, where the form of his commitment was judged illegal: at length, he was tried by a court-martial, appointed by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the admiralty, though not before an act had pa&s;&s;ed, declaring the power of a lord high-admiral ve&s;ted in tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners. The pre&s;ident of the court was Sir Ralph Delaval, who had acted as vice-admiral of the blue, in the engage|ment. The earl was acquitted: but, the king di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from the &s;ervice; and the Dutch exclaimed again&s;t the partiality of his judges.</P>

<P>William is &s;aid to have taken all the papers of his father-in law and Tyrconnel, and to have learned from them, not only the de&s;ign pro|jected by the French to burn the Engli&s;h tran&s;ports, but likewi&s;e the under|taking of one Jones, who engaged to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate king William. No &s;uch at|tempt, however, was made; and, in all probability, the whole report was a fiction, calculated to throw an odium on James's character. On the ninth day of July, William detached general Douglas with a con&s;iderable body of hor&s;e and foot towards Athlone; while he him&s;elf, having left Trelawny to command at Dublin, advanced with the re&s;t of his army to Inchequin, in his way to Kil|kenny. Colonel Grace, the governor of Athlone for king James, being &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, fired a pi&s;tol at the trumpeter, &s;aying, "The&s;e are my terms." Then Douglas re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege of the place, which was natu|rally very &s;trong, and defended by a re&s;olute garri&s;on. An incon&s;iderable breach was made, when Douglas receiving intelligence that Sarsfield was on his march to the relief of the be&s;ieged, abandoned the enterprize, after having lo&s;t above four hundred men in the attempt. The king continued his march to the we&s;tward; and, by dint of &s;evere examples, e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch order and di&s;cipline in his army, that the pea&s;ants were &s;ecure from the lea&s;t violence. At Carlow he detached the duke of Ormond to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Kilkenny, where that nobleman regaled him in his own ca&s;tle, which the enemy had left undamaged. While the army encamped at Carrick, major-general Kirke was &s;ent to Waterford, the garri&s;on of which, con&s;i&s;ting of two regiments, capi|tulated, upon condition of marching out with their arms and baggage, and being conducted to Mallow. The fort of Duncannon was &s;urrendered on the &s;ame terms. Here the lord Dover and the lord George Howard were ad|mitted to the benefit of the king's mercy and protection.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>On the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, William being at Chapel-Izard, publi&s;hed a &s;econd declaration of mercy, confirming the former, and even ex|tending it to per&s;ons of &s;uperior rank and &s;tation, whether natives or foreigners, provided they would, by the twenty-fifth day of the month, lay down their arms, and &s;ubmit to certain conditions. This offer of indemnity produced very little effect; for the Iri&s;h were generally governed by their prie&s;ts; and the news of the victory which the French fleet had obtained over the Engli&s;h and Dutch, were circulated with &s;uch exaggerations as elevated their &s;pirits, and effaced all thoughts of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The king had returned to Dublin, with a view to embark of England; but receiving notice that the de&s;igns of his dome&s;tic enemies were di&s;covered and fru&s;trated, that the fleet was repaired, and the French navy retired to Bre&s;t, he po&s;tponed his voyage, and re&s;olved to reduce Limerick, in which mon&s;ieur Boi&s;&s;eleau commanded as governor, and the duke of Berwick and colonel Sarsfield acted as inferior officers. On the ninth day of Augu&s;t, the king having called in his detachments, and ad|vanced into the neighbourhood of the place, &s;ummoned the commander to de|liver the town; and Boi&s;&s;eleau an&s;wered, that he imagined the be&s;t way to gain the good opinion of the prince of Orange, would be a vigorous defence of the town, which his maje&s;ty had committed to his charge. Before the place was fully inve&s;ted, colonel Sarsfield, with a body of hor&s;e and dragoons, pa&s;&s;ed the Shannon in the night, intercepted the king's train of artillery on its way to the camp, routed the troops that guarded it, di&s;abled the cannon, de&s;troyed
<PB N="54" REF="570">
the carriages, waggons, and ammunition, and returned in &s;afety to Limerick. Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;a&s;ter, the trenches were opened on the &s;eventeenth day of the month, and a battery was rai&s;ed with &s;ome cannon brought from Wa|terford. The &s;iege was carried on with vigour, and the place defended with great re&s;olution. At length the king ordered his troops to make a lodgment in the covered way or counter&s;carp, which was accordingly a&s;&s;aulted with great fury: but the a$$ailants met with &s;uch a warm reception from the be&s;ieged, that they were repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of twelve hundred men, either killed on the &s;pot or mortally wounded. This di&s;appointment concurring with the badne&s;s of the weather, which became rainy and unwhol&s;ome, induced the king to renounce his undertaking. The heavy baggage and cannon being &s;ent away, the army decampted and marched towards Clonmel. William having con&s;tituted the lord Sidney and Thomas Coning&s;by lords ju&s;tices of Ireland, and left the command of the army with count Solmes, embarked at Duncanno$, with prince George of Denmark, on the fifth of September, and next day arrived in King's ro$d, near Bri&s;tol, from whence he r$p$ired to Wind$or.</P>

<P>About the l$tter end of this month, the earl of Marlborough arrived in Ireland with five thou&s;and Engli&s;h troops, to attack Cork and Kin|&s;ale, in conjunction with a detachment from the great army, according to a &s;cheme he had propo&s;ed to king William. Having landed his &s;oldiers, without much oppo&s;ition in the neighbourhood of Cork, he was joined by five thou&s;and men, under the prince of Wirtemberg, between whom and the earl a di&s;pute aro&s;e about the command: but this was compromi&s;ed by the interpo&s;ition of L$ Mellionere. The place being i$$e&s;t$d, and the b$tteries rai&s;ed, the be|&s;iegers proceeded with &s;uch rapidity that a bre$ch was &s;oon eff$cted. Colonel Mackillicut the governor demanded a parley, and ho&s;tages were exchanged: but he rejected the conditions that were offered, and ho&s;tilities recommenced with redoubled vigour. The duke of Grafton, who &s;erved on this occa&s;ion as a volunteer, was mortally wounded in one of the attacks, and died regreted as a youth of promi&s;ing talents. Preparations being made for a general a&s;&s;ault, the be&s;ieged thought proper to capitulate, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. Be&s;ides the governor and colonel Ricaut, the victor found the earls of Clan|carty and Ty$one among the individuals of the garri&s;on. Marlborough having taken po$$e&s;&s;ion of Cork, detached brigadier Villiers with a body of hor&s;e and dragoons to &s;ummon the town and forts of Kin&s;ale; and next day advanced with the re&s;t of the forces. The old fort was immediately taken by a&s;&s;ault; but Sir Edward Scot, who commanded the other, &s;u&s;tained a regular &s;iege, until the breach was practicable, and then obtained an honourable capitulation. The&s;e maritime places being reduced, all communication between France and the enemy, on this &s;ide of the i&s;land, was cut off, and the Iri&s;h were confined to Ul&s;ter, where they could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without great difficulty. The earl of Marlborough having fini&s;hed this expedition in thirty days, returned with his pri&s;oners to England, where the &s;ame of this exploit added greatly to his re|putation.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, count de Lauzun commander of the French auxiliaries in Ireland, lay inactive in the neighbourhood of Gal|way, and tran&s;mitted &s;uch a lamentable account of his &s;ituation to the court of

France, that tran&s;ports were &s;ent over to bring home the French forces. In the&s;e he embarked with his troops, and the command of the Iri&s;h forces de|volved to the duke of Berwick, though it was afterwards transfer$ed to Mr. St. Ruth. Lauzun was di&s;graced at Ver&s;ailles, for having de&s;er$ed the cau&s;e before it was de&s;per$te; and Tyrco$$el, who accompanied him in his voyage, &s;olicited the French court for a further &s;upply of officers, arms, cloaths, and ammunition, for the Iri&s;h army, which he &s;aid would continue firm to the intere&s;t of king James, if thus &s;upported. Mean while, they formed them|&s;elves into &s;eparate bodies of freebooters, and plundered the country, under the appellation of R$pparies; while the troops of king William either $$joyed their ea&s;e in quarters, or imit$ted the rapine of the enemy; &s;o that, between both, the poor people were mi&s;erably harra&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>The affairs of the continent had not yet undergone any change of importance, except in the conduct of the duke of Savoy, who renounced his neutrality, engaged in an alliance with the emperor and king of Spain; and, in a word, acceded to the grand confederacy. He had no &s;ooner declared him&s;elf, than Catinat the French general entered his territories at the head of eighteen thou&s;and men, defeated him in a pitched battle near S$luces, which immediately &s;urrendered to the conqueror. Then he reduced Savillana, Villa Franca, with &s;everal other places, pur&s;ued the duke to Carignan, &s;urpri&s;ed Suza, and di&s;tributed his forces in winter-quarters, partly in Provence, and partly in the dutchy of Savoy, which St. Ruth had lately reduced under the dominion of France. The duke finding him&s;elf di&s;appointed in the &s;uccours he expected from the emperor and king of Spain, demanded a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;tates-general and king William, to whom he &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador to congra|culate him upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of England. The confederates, in their general congre&s;s at the Hague, had agreed that the army of the &s;tates under prince Waldeck &s;hould oppo&s;e the forces of France, com$$nd$d by the duke of Luxemburg in Flanders; while the elector of Brandenburg &s;hould ob&s;erve the marquis de Boufflers on the Mo&s;elle: but, before the troops of Brandenburg could be a&s;&s;embled, Boufflers encamped between the Sambre and the Meu&s;e, and maintained a free communication with Luxemburg.</P>

<P>Prince Waldeck under&s;tanding that this general int$nded to cro&s;s the Sambre between Namur and Charleroy, in order to lay the Spani&s;h territories under contribution, decamped from the river Pieton, and detached the count of Berlo, with a great body of hor&s;e, to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy. He was encountered by the French army near Flerus, and &s;lain; and his troops, though &s;upported by two other detachments, were hardly able to rejoin the main body, which continued all night in order of battle. Next day they were attacked by the French, who were greatly &s;uperior to them in number; and, after a very ob&s;tinate engagement, obliged to give way, leaving about five thou&s;and men dead upon the field of battle. The enemy took about four thou&s;and pri&s;oners, and the greate&s;t part of their artillery; but the victory was dearly bought. The Dutch infantry fought with &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;olution and &s;ucce&s;s. The duke of Luxemburg owned, with &s;urpri&s;e, that they had &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the Spani&s;h foot at the battle of Rocroy. <Q>&startq;Prince Waldeck (&s;aid he) ought always to remember the French hor&s;e; and I &s;hall never forget the Dutch infantry.&endq;</Q> The Dutch general exerted him&s;elf

The emperor was le&s;s fortunate in his efforts again&s;t the Turks, who rejected the conditions of peace he had offered, and took the field, under a new vizir. In the month of Augu&s;t, count Tekeli defeated a body of Im|peria$$&s;ts near Cron&s;tadt, in Tran&s;ylvania; then convoking the &s;tates of that province at Al$a$uha$ he compelled them to $lect him their &s;overeign: but his reign was of &s;hort duration. Prince Lewis of Baden having taken the com|mand of the Au&s;trian army, detached four regiments into Belgrade, and advanced again&s;t Tekeli, who retired into Valachia at his approach. Mean while, the grand vizir inve&s;ted Belgrade, and carried on his attacks with &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;olution. At length, a bomb falling upon a great tower, in which the powder$magazine of the be&s;ieged was contained, the place blew up with a dreadful explo&s;ion. Seven|teen hundred &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on were de&s;troyed; the walls and $word$ ar$ w$$e overthrown, the ditch was filled up$ and &s;o large a breach was opened, that the Turks entered by $$$$drons and $attal$ons, cutting in pieces all that fell in their way. The fire &s;pread from magazine to magazine, until eleven were de&s;troyed; and, in the confu&s;ion, the remaining part of the g$rri$$n e&s;caped to Peterwaradin. By this time the Imperiali&s;ts were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tran&s;ylvania, and cantoned at Cron&s;ta$t and Clau&s;inburg. Tekeli undertook to attack the province on one &s;ide, while a body of Turks &s;hould invade it on the other: the&s;e la&s;t were totally di&s;per&s;ed by prince Lewis of Baden: but prince Augu&s;tus of Hanover, whom he had detached again&s;t the count, was $word$ $n a $$rro$ $word$ and his troops obliged to retreat with precipitation.

Tekeli, however, did not improve this advantage. Being appri&s;ed of the fate of his allies, and afraid of &s;eeing his retreat cut off by the &s;now, that fre|quently choaks up the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, he retreated again to Va|lachia, and prince Lewis returned to Vienna.</P>

<P>King William having publi&s;hed a proclamation, requiring the at|tendance of the members on the &s;econd day of October, both hou&s;es met ac|cordingly, and he opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech to the u&s;ual purport. He mentioned what he had done towards the reduction of Ireland; commended the behaviour of the troops$ told them the &s;upplies were not equal to the ne|ce&s;&s;ary expence; repre&s;ented the danger to which the nation would be expo&s;ed, unle&s;s the war &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted with vigour; conjured them to clear his revenue, which was mortgaged for the payment of former debts, and enable him to pay off the arrears of the army; a&s;&s;ured them that the &s;ucce&s;s of the confederacy abroad would depend upon the vigour and di&s;patch of their pro|ceedings; expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e who had been guilty of mi&s;|conduct in the management of the fleet; recommended unanimity and expedi|tion, and declared, that whoever &s;hould attempt to divert their attention from tho&s;e &s;ubjects of importance which he had propo&s;ed, could neither be a friend to him, nor a wellwi&s;her to his country. The late attempt of the French upon the coa&s;t of England, the rumours of a con&s;piracy by the Jacobites, the per|&s;onal<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. $word$</NOTE> valour which William had di&s;played in Ireland, and the pu&s;illanimous behaviour of James, concurred in warming the re&s;entment of the nation again&s;t the adherents of the late king, and in rai&s;ing a tide of loyalty in favour of the new government. Both hou&s;es pre&s;ented &s;eparate addre&s;&s;es of con|gratulation to the king and queen, upon his courage and conduct in the field, and her fortitude and &s;agacity at the helm, in times of danger and di&s;quiet. The commons, pur&s;uant to an e&s;timate laid before them of the next year's ex|pences, voted a &s;upply of four millions for the maintenance of the army and navy, and &s;ettled the funds for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>They propo&s;ed to rai&s;e one million by the &s;ale of forfeited e&s;tates in Ireland: they re&s;olved, that a bill &s;hould be brought in for confi&s;cating tho&s;e e&s;tates, with a clau&s;e, impowering the king to be&s;tow a third part of them on tho&s;e who had &s;erved in the war, as well as to grant &s;uch articles and capitula|tions to tho&s;e who were in arms, as he &s;hould think proper. This clau&s;e was rejected; and a great number of petitions were offered again&s;t the bill, by cre|ditors and heirs, who had continued faithful to the government. The&s;e were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;ugge&s;ted by the court, in order to retard the progre&s;s of the bill; for the e&s;tates had been already promi&s;ed to the king's favourites: neverthele&s;s, the bill pa&s;&s;ed the lower hou&s;e, and was &s;ent up to the lords, among whom it was purpo&s;ely delayed by the influence of the mini&s;try. It was at this juncture that lord Torrington was tried and acquitted, very much to the di&s;&s;atisfaction of the king, who not only di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from the &s;ervice, but even forbade him to appear in his pre&s;ence. When William came to the hou&s;e of lords, to give the royal a&s;&s;ent to a bill for doubling the exci&s;e, he told the parlia|ment, that the po&s;ture of affairs required his pre&s;ence at the Hague; that therefore, they ought to lo&s;e no time in perfecting &s;uch other &s;upplies as were &s;till nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of the army and navy; and he reminded them of making &s;ome provi&s;ion for the expence of the civil government.

bills were accordingly pa&s;&s;ed for granting to their maje&s;ties the duties on goods imported for five years; and the&s;e, together with t$e mutiny-bill, received the royal a&s;&s;ent: upon which occa&s;ion the king ob&s;erved, that if &s;ome annual pro|vi&s;ion could be made for augmenting the navy, it would greatly conduce to the honour and &s;afety of the nation. In con&s;equence of this hint, they voted a con|&s;iderable &s;upply for building additional &s;hips of war <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;upply was rai&s;ed by the additional du|ties upon $eer, $$e, and other liquors.

Pilkington and his a&s;&s;ociates undertook to prove, that tho&s;e allegations were either fal&s;e or frivolous; and repre&s;ented the petition as a contrivance of the Jacobites, to di&s;turb the peace of the city, that the &s;upply might be re|tarded, and the government di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. In the late panic which over&s;pread the nation, the Whigs had appeared to be the monied men, and &s;ub&s;cribed largely for the &s;ecurity of the &s;ettlement they had made, while the Tories kept aloof with a &s;u&s;picious caution. For this rea&s;on the court now interpo&s;ed its influence in &s;uch a manner, that little or no regard was payed to their remon&s;trance.</P>

<P>The marquis of Carmaerthen lord-pre&s;ident, who was at the head of the Tory intere&s;t in the mini&s;try, and had acquired great credit with the king and queen, now fell under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the oppo&s;ite faction; and they re&s;olved (if po&s;&s;ible) to revive his old impeachment. The earl of Shrew&s;bury, and thirteen other leading men, had engaged in this de&s;ign. A committee of lords was appointed to examine precedents, and enquire whether impeachments con|tinued in &s;tatu quo from parliament to parliament. Several &s;uch precedents were reported; and violent debates en&s;ued: but, the marquis eluded the ven|$geance

He told them it was high time for him to embark for Hol|land; recommended unanimity, and a&s;&s;ured them of his particular favour and protection.

<P>William having &s;ettled the affairs of the nation, &s;et out for Margate on the &s;ixth day of January; but, the &s;hip in which he propo&s;ed to embark, being de$ained by an ea&s;terly wind and hard fro&s;t, he returned to Ken&s;ington. On the &s;ixteenth, however, he embarked at Grave&s;end with a numerous retinue, and &s;et &s;ail for Holland, under convoy of twelve &s;hips of war, comm$nded by admiral Rooke. Next day, being informed by a fi&s;herman, that he was with|in a league and a half of Goree, he quitted the yacht, and went into an open boat, attended by the duke of Ormond, the earls of Devon&s;hire, Dor&s;et, Port|land, and Monmouth, with Overkirke, and Zuyle&s;tein. In&s;tead of landing im|mediately, they lo&s;t &s;ight of the fleet, and night coming on, were expo&s;ed in very &s;evere weather to the danger of the enemy and the &s;ea, which ran very high for eighteen hours, during which the king and all his attendants were drenched with &s;ea-water. When the &s;ailors expre&s;&s;ed their apprehen&s;ions of peri&s;hing, the king a&s;ked, if they were afraid to die in his company? At day-break he landed on the i&s;le of Goree, where he took &s;ome refre&s;hment in a fi&s;herman's hut; then he committed him&s;elf to the boat again, and was conveyed to the &s;hore in the neighbourhood of Mae&s;land&s;luys. A deputation of the &s;tates re|ceived him at Houn&s;lardyke; and about &s;ix in the evening he arrived at the Hague, where he was immediately complimented by the &s;tates-general, the &s;tates of Holland, the council of &s;tate, the other colleges, and the foreign mi|ni&s;ters. He afterwards, at the reque&s;t of the magi&s;trates, made his public entry with &s;urpri&s;ing magnificence; and the Dutch celebrated his arrival with bon|fires, illuminations, and other marks of tumultuous joy. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted at their diffe|rent a&s;&s;emblies; informed them of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es in England and Ireland; and a&s;&s;ured them of his con&s;tant zeal and affection for his native country.</P>

He de|clared he would &s;pare neither his credit, forces, nor per&s;on, in concurring with their mea&s;ures; and that in the &s;pring he would come at the head of his troops to fulfil his engagements. They forthwith re&s;olved to employ two hundred and

twenty-two thou&s;and men again&s;t France in the en&s;uing campaign. The pro|portions of the different princes and &s;tates were regulated; and the king of England agreed to furni&s;h twenty thou&s;and. He &s;upplied the duke of Savoy &s;o liberally, that his affairs &s;oon a&s;&s;umed a more promi&s;ing a&s;pect. The plan of operations was &s;ettled; and they tran&s;acted their affairs with &s;uch harmony, that no di&s;pute interrupted their deliberations. In the beginning of March, imme|diately after the congre&s;s broke up, the &s;iege of Mons was undertaken by the French king in per&s;on, accompanied by the dauphin, the dukes of Orleans and Chartres. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of about &s;ix thou&s;and men, commanded by the prince of Bergue; but, the be&s;iegers carried on$their works with &s;uch rapi|dity as they could not with&s;tand. King William no &s;ooner under&s;tood that the place was inve&s;ted, than he ordered prince Waldeck to a&s;&s;emble the army, determined to march again&s;t the enemy in per&s;on. Fifty thou&s;and men were &s;oon collected at Halle near Bru&s;&s;els; but, when he went thither, he found the Spaniards had neglected to provide carriages and other nece&s;&s;aries for the expe|dition. Mean while, the burghers of Mons &s;eeing their town in danger of being utterly de&s;troyed by the bombs and cannon of the enemy, pre&s;&s;ed the governor to capitulate, and even threatened to introduce the be&s;iegers: &s;o that he was forced to comply, and obtained very honourable conditions.

<HEAD>&sect; I.</HEAD>
<P>A Con&s;piracy again&s;t the government had been lately di&s;covered. In the latter end of December, the ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el who lived at Bark|ing in E&s;&s;ex, informed the marquis of Carmaerthen, that his wife had let out one of his barks to carry over &s;ome per&s;ons to France; and that they would embark on the thirtieth day of the month. This intelligence being communi|cated to the king and council, an order was &s;ent to captain Billop, to watch the motion of the ve&s;&s;el and &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;engers. He accordingly boarded her at Grave&s;end, and found in the hold lord Pre&s;ton, Mr. A&s;hton, a &s;ervant of the late queen, and one Elliot. He likewi&s;e &s;eized a bundle of papers, &s;ome of which were &s;carce intelligible; and among the re&s;t, two letters &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by Turner bi&s;hop of Ely to king James and his queen, under fictitious names. The whole amounted to an invitation to the French king, to a&s;&s;i&s;t king James in rea&s;cending the throne, upon certain conditions, while William &s;hould be ab&s;ent from the kingdom: but the &s;cheme was ill layed, and countenanced but by a very few per&s;ons of con&s;ideration$ among whom the chiefs were the earl of Clarendon, the bi&s;hop of Ely, lord Pre&s;ton, his brother Mr. Graham, and Penn the famous quaker. Notwith&s;tanding the outcries which had been made again&s;t the &s;everities of the late government, Pre&s;ton and his accomplice
<PB N="62" REF="650" MS="Y">
A&s;hton, were tried at the Old Bailey for compa&s;&s;ing the death of their maje&s;ties king William and queen Mary; and their $r$als were hurried on without any regard to their petitions for delay. Lord Pre&s;ton alledged, in his defence, that the trea&s;ons charged upon him were not committed in the county of Middle&s;ex, as laid in the indictment; that none of the witne&s;&s;es declared he had any con|cern in $iring the ve&s;&s;el; that the papers were not found upon him; that there ought to be two credible witne&s;&s;es to every fact, whe$eas the whole proof again&s;t him re&s;ted on &s;imilitude of hands and m$r$ $$ppo&s;ition. He was neverthele&s;s $ound guilty. A&s;hton behaved with great i$$repidity and compo&s;ure. He owned his purpo&s;e of going to France, in pur&s;$ance of a promi&s;e he had made to general Worden, who, on his de$th-b$d, c$$jured him to go thither and fini&s;h &s;ome affairs of con$$quence which he had le$t there depending; and with a view to recover a con&s;iderable &s;um of money due to him&s;elf. He denied that he was privy to the contents of the papers $ound upon him; he complained of his having been denied time to prepare for his trial; and called &s;everal per&s;ons to prove him a prote&s;tant of exemplary piety and irreproachable morals. The&s;e circum&s;tances had no weight with the court. He was brow-beaten by the bench, and found guilty by the jury, as he had the papers in his cu&s;tody: yet there was no privity proved; and the Whig party them&s;elves had often expre&s;ly de|clared, that of all &s;orts of evidence, that of finding papers in a per&s;on's po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion is the weake&s;t, becau&s;e no man can &s;ecure him&s;elf from &s;uch danger. A&s;h$o$ &s;uffered with equal courage and decorum. In a paper which he de|livered to the &s;heriff, he owned his attachment to king James; he witne&s;&s;ed to the birth of the prince of Wales; denied his knowledge of the contents of the papers that were committed to his charge; complaine$ of the hard mea&s;ure he had met with from the judges and the jury, but forgave them in the &s;ight of heaven. This man was celebrated by the No$$urors as a martyr to loyalty; and they boldly affirmed, that his chief crime in the eyes of the government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barne$. State tracts. Burche$. T$ndal. Ralph.</NOTE> was his having among his baggage, an account of &s;uch evidence as would have been convincing to all the world, concerning the birth of the prince of Wales, which by a great number of people was believed &s;uppo&s;ititious <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To o$e of the p$$phlets publi&s;hed on this occa$$on, is annexed a petition to the pre&s;ent go|vernment, in the name of king James's adherents, importing, that &s;ome grave and learned per&s;on &s;hould be $$t$orized to compile a treati&s;e &s;hew|ing the grounds of William's title; and in ca$e the performance &s;hould carry conviction along with it, they would &s;ubmit to that title, as they had hitherto oppo&s;ed it from a principle of con|&s;cie$ce. The be&s;t an&s;wer that could be made to this $$mmons, was Locke's book upon govern|ment, which appeared at this period. <BIBL>Ralph.</BIBL></NOTE>. Lord Pre&s;ton obtained a pardon; Elliot was not tried, becau&s;e no evidence appeared again&s;t him; the earl of Clarendon was &s;ent to the Tower, where he remained &s;ome months, and he was afterwards confined to his own hou&s;e in the country: an indulgence which he owed to his con&s;anguinity with the queen, who was his fir&s;t cou&s;in. The bi&s;hop of Ely, Graham, and Penn ab&s;conded; and a proclama|tion was i&s;&s;ued for apprehending them as traitors.</P>

<P>This prelate's being concerned in a con&s;piracy, furni&s;hed the king with a plau&s;ible pretence for filling up the vacant bi&s;hoprics. The deprived bi&s;hops had been given to under&s;tand, that an act of parliament might be obtained to excu&s;e them from taking the oaths, provided they would perform their epi&s;co|pal functions; but, as they declined this expedient, the king re&s;olved to fill up
<PB N="63" REF="660">
their places at his return from Holland. Accordingly the archbi&s;hopric of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1691.</NOTE> Canterbury was conferred upon doctor Tillot&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beveridge was promoted to the &s;ee of Bath and Wells, Fowler to that of Glouce$$er, Cum|berland to Peterborough, M$ore to Norwich, Grove to Chiche&s;ter, and Patrick to fly.</NOTE>, one of the mo&s;t learned, moderate, and virtuous eccle&s;ia&s;tics of the age, who did not accept of this pro|motion without great reluctance, becau&s;e he fore&s;aw that he &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the &s;lander and malevolence of that party which e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of his predece&s;&s;or. The other vacant &s;ees were given to divines of unblemi&s;hed cha|racter; and the public in general &s;eemed very well &s;atisfied with this e$ertion of the king's &s;upremacy. The deprived bi&s;hops at fir&s;t affected all the meekne&s;s of re&s;ignation. They remembered tho&s;e &s;houts of popular approbation, by which they had been animated in the per&s;$cution they &s;uffered under the late government; and they hoped the &s;ame cordial would &s;upport them in their pre|&s;ent affliction: but, finding the nation cold in their concern, they deter$ined to warm it by argument and declamation. The pre&s;s groaned with the efforts of their learning and re&s;entment; and every e&s;&s;ay was an&s;wered by their oppo|nents. The Nonjurors affirmed that Chri&s;tianity was a doctrine of the cro&s;s; that no pretence whatever could ju&s;tify an in&s;urrection again&s;t the &s;overeign; that the primitive chri&s;tians thought it their indi&s;pen&s;ible duty so be pa&s;&s;ive under every inva&s;ion of their rights; that non-re&s;i&s;tance was the d$ctrine of the Engli&s;h church, confirmed by all the &s;anctions that could be derived from the laws of God and man. The other party not only &s;upported the natural righ$$ of mankind, and explained the u&s;e that might be made of the doctrine of non|r$&s;i&s;tance, in exciting fre&s;h commotions, but they al&s;o argued, that if pa&s;&s;$ve obedience was right in any in&s;tance, it was conclu&s;ively &s;o with regard to the pre&s;ent government; for the obedience required by &s;cripture was indi&s;cri$inate, <Q>&startq;the powers that be, are ordained of God&mdash;let every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers.&endq;</Q> From the&s;e texts they inferred, that the new o$ths ought to be taken without &s;cruple; and that tho&s;e who refu&s;ed them, con$$aled party under the cloak of con&s;cience. On the other hand, the fallacy and treachery of this argument were demon&s;trated. They &s;aid it levelled all di&s;tinctions of j$$|tice and duty; that tho&s;e who taught &s;uch doctrines attached them&s;elves &s;o$ely to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, how&s;oever unju&s;tly acquired; that if twenty different u&s;urpers &s;hould &s;ucceed one another, they would recognize the la&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the allegiance they had &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn to his predece&s;&s;or, like the &s;awning &s;paniel that followed the thief who mounted his ma&s;ter's hor&s;e, after having murdered the right owner. They al&s;o denied the ju&s;tice of a lay-deprivation, and with re&s;pect to church-government &s;tarted the &s;ame di$$inction$ <Q>&startq;De ju$$ and De facto,&endq;</Q> which they had formerly made in the civil admini&s;tration. They had even recour&s;e to all the bitterne&s;s of invective again&s;t Tillot&s;on and the new bi&s;hops, whom they reviled as intruders and u&s;urpers; but their acrim$ny was chiefly directed again&s;t Dr. Sherlock, who had been one of the mo&s;t violent &s;ticklers again&s;t the revolution, but thought proper to take the oaths upon the retreat of king James from Ireland. They branded him as an apo$tate who had betrayed his cau&s;e, and publi&s;hed a review of his whole conduct, which proved a &s;evere &s;atire upon his character. Their attacks upon individuals were mingled with their vengeance again&s;t the government: and indeed the great aim of their divines as well as of their politicians, was to $ap the foundation of
<PB N="64" REF="670">
the new $$$$lement. In order to $$$$nate the minds of the people from the in|tere&s;ts of the $word$ prince$ they ridiculed his character, inveighed again&s;t his $span$ him of $word$ the concerns of England to the advantage of his $word$ country$ and drew invidious compari&s;ons between the wealth, the trade, $$e taxes of the la&s;t and of the pre&s;ent reign.

<P>The pre&s;byterians in Scotland acted with &s;uch folly, violence, and ty|ranny, as rendered them equally odious and contemptible. The tran&s;actions in their general a&s;&s;embly were carried on with &s;uch peevi&s;hne&s;s, partiality, and inju&s;tice, that the king di&s;&s;olved it by an act of &s;tate, and convoked another for the month of November in the following year. The epi&s;copal party promi&s;ed to enter heartily into the intere&s;ts of the new government, to keep the Highland|ers quiet, and induce the clergy to acknowledge and &s;erve king William, pro|vided he would ballance the power of Melvill and his parti&s;ans in &s;uch a manner as would &s;ecure them from violence and oppre&s;&s;ion; provided the epi&s;copal mini&s;ters &s;hould be permitted to perform their functions among tho&s;e people by whom they were beloved; and that &s;uch of them as were willing to mix with the pre&s;byterians in their judicatories, &s;hould be admitted without any &s;evere impo&s;ition in point of opinion. The king, who was extremely di&s;gu&s;ted at the pre&s;byterians, reli&s;hed the propo&s;al; and young Dalrymple, &s;on of lord Stair, was appointed joint &s;ecretary of &s;tate with Melvill. He undertook to bring over the majority of the Jacobites$ and a great number of them took the oaths; but at the &s;ame time they maintained a corre&s;pondence with the court of St. Ger|mains, by the connivance of which they &s;ubmitted to William, that they might be in a condition to &s;erve James the more effectually. The Scotti&s;h par|liament was adjourned by proclamation to the &s;ixteenth day of September. Precautions were taken to prevent any dangerous communication with the con|tinent; a committee was appointed to put the kingdom in a po&s;ture of defence; to exerci&s;e the powers of the regency, in &s;ecuring the enemies of the govern|ment: and the earl of Home$ with Sir Peter Fra&s;er and Sir Aeneas Macpher|&s;on$ was apprehended and impri&s;oned.</P>

<P>The king having &s;ettled the operations of the ensuing campaign in Ireland$ where general G$$ckle exerci&s;ed the &s;upreme command, manned his fleet by dint of pre&s;&s;ing &s;ailors$ to the incredible annoyance of commerce, left the queen as before at the helm of government in England$ returned to Holland, accompanied by lord Sidney &s;ecretary of &s;tate, the earls of Marl|borough and Portland$ and began to make preparations for taking the field in per&s;on. On the thirt$eth day of May, the duke of Luxemburg having pa&s;&s;ed the Scheld at the head of a large army, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Halle, and gave it up to plunder, in &s;ight of the confederates, who were obliged to throw up in|trenchments for their pre&s;ervation. At the &s;ame time the marquis de Boufflers, with a con&s;iderable body of forces, intrenched him&s;elf before Liege, with a view
<PB N="65" REF="680">
to bombard that city. In the beginning of June, king William took upon him|&s;elf the command of the allied army, by this time reinforced in &s;uch a manner as to be &s;uperior to the enemy. He forthwith detached the count de Tilly with ten thou&s;and men to the relief of Liege, which was already reduced to ruins and de&s;olation by the bombs, bullets, and repeated attacks of Boufflers, who now thought proper to retreat to Dinant. Tilly having thus rai&s;ed the &s;iege and thrown a body of troops into Huy, rejoined the confederate army, which had been augmented even &s;ince his departure with &s;ix thou&s;and men from Branden|burg, and ten thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians, commanded by the landgrave in per&s;on. Such was the vigilance of Luxemburg, that William could not avail him&s;elf of his &s;uperiority. In vain he exhau&s;ted his invention in marches, countermarches, and &s;tratagems, to bring on a general engagement: the French mar&s;hal avoided it with &s;uch dexterity as baffled all his endeavours. In the cour&s;e of this campaign, the two armies twice confronted each other; but they were &s;ituated in &s;uch a man|ner that neither could begin the attack without a manife&s;t di&s;advantage. While the king lay encamped at Court-&s;ur-heure, a &s;oldier, corrupted by the enemy, &s;et fire to the fu&s;es of &s;everal bombs, the explo&s;ion of which might have blown up the whole magazine, and produced infinite confu&s;ion in the army, had not the mi&s;chief been prevented by the courage of the men that guarded the artillery: even while the fu&s;es were burning they di&s;engaged the waggons from the line, and overturned them down the &s;ide of a hill; &s;o that the communication of the fire was intercepted. The per&s;on who made this treacherous attempt being di&s;covered, owned he had been employed for this purpo&s;e by the duke of Lux|emburg. He was tried by a court-martial, and &s;uffered the death of a traitor. King William quitting Court-&s;ur-heure, encamped upon the plain of St. Girard, where he remained till the fourth day of September, con&s;uming the forage and exhau&s;ting the country. Then he pa&s;&s;ed the Sambre near Jemeppe, while the French cro&s;&s;ed it at La Bu&s;ierre, and both armies marched towards Enghien. The enemy perceiving the confederates were at their heels, proceeded to Gra|mont, pa&s;&s;ed the Dender, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong camp between Aeth and Oudenarde; William followed the &s;ame route, and encamped between Aeth and Leu&s;e. While he continued in this po&s;t, the He&s;&s;ian forces and tho&s;e of Liege, amounting to about eighteen thou&s;and men, &s;eparated from the army and pa&s;&s;ed the Meu&s;e at Namur; then the king returned to the Hague, leaving the command to prince Waldeck, who forthwith removed to Leu&s;e, and on the twentieth day of the month began his march to Cambron. Luxemburg, who watched his motions with a curious eye, found means to attack him in his retreat &s;o &s;uddenly, that his rear was &s;urpri&s;ed and defeated, though the French were at la&s;t obliged to retire: the prince continued his route to Cambron, and in a little time both armies retired into winter-quarters. In the mean time, the duke de Noailles be&s;ieged and took Urgel in Catalonia, while a French &s;quadron, commanded by the count D'Etrees, bombarded Barcelona and Alicant.</P>

<P>The confederates had propo&s;ed to act vigorou&s;ly in Italy again&s;t the French; but the &s;ea&s;on was far advanced before they were in a condition to take the field. The emperor and Spain had undertaken to furni&s;h troops to join the duke of Savoy, and the maritime powers contributed their proportion in money. The elector of Bavaria was nominated to the &s;upreme command of
<PB N="6$" REF="690">
the imperial forces in that country; the marquis de Leganez, governor of the Milane&s;e, acted as tru&s;tee for the Spani&s;h monarch; duke Schomberg, lately created duke of Lein&s;ter, managed the intere&s;t of William as king of England and &s;tadtholder, and commanded a body of the Vaudois payed by Great Britain. Before the German auxiliaries arrived, the French had made great progre&s;s in their conque&s;ts. Catinat made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Villa-Franca, Nice, and &s;ome other fortifications; then he reduced Villana and Carmagnola, and detached the mar|quis de Feuquieres to inve&s;t Coni, a &s;trong fortre&s;s garri&s;oned by the Vaudois and French refugees. The duke of Savoy was now reduced to the brink of ruin. He &s;aw almo&s;t all his places of &s;trength in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy: Coni was be&s;ieged; and la Hoguette, another French general, had forced the pa&s;&s;es of the valley of Ao&s;te; &s;o that he had free admi&s;&s;ion into the Verceillois and the frontiers of the Milane&s;e. Turin was threatened with a bombardment; the people were di&s;pirited and clamorous; and their &s;overeign lay with his little army encamped on the hill of Montcallier, from whence he beheld his towns taken and his palace of Rivoli de&s;troyed. Duke Schomberg exhorted him to act on the offen&s;ive, and give battle to Catinat, while that officer's army was weakened by detachments; and prince Eugene &s;upported his remon&s;trance: but this propo&s;al was vehemently oppo&s;ed by the marquis de Leganez, who fore&s;aw that if the duke &s;hould be defeated, the French would penetrate into the territories of Milan. The relief of Coni, however, was undertaken by prince Eugene, who began his march for that place with a convoy guarded by two and twenty hundred hor&s;e: at Magliano he was reinforced by five thou&s;and militia; and Bulonde, who commanded at the &s;iege, no &s;ooner heard of his ap|proach than he retired with the utmo&s;t precipitation, leaving behind &s;ome pieces of cannon, mortars, bombs, arms, ammunition, tents, provi&s;ions, uten&s;ils, with all his &s;ick and wounded. When he joined Catinat, he was immediately put under arre&s;t, and afterwards ca&s;hiered with di&s;grace. Hoguette aban|doned the valley of Ao&s;te; Feuquieres was &s;ent with a detachment to change the garri&s;on of Ca&s;al, and Catinat retired with his army towards Villa Nova d'A&s;te.</P>

<P>The mi&s;carriage of the French before Coni affected Louvois the mini&s;ter of Lewis &s;o deeply, that he could not help &s;hedding tears when he communicated the event to his ma&s;ter, who told him, with great compo&s;ure, that he was &s;poiled by good fortune. But the retreat of the French from Piedmont had a &s;till greater influence over the re&s;olutions of the conclave at Rome, then &s;itting for the election of a new pope in the room of Alexander VIII. who died in the beginning of February. Notwith&s;tanding the power and intrigues of the French faction, headed by the cardinal D'Etrees, the affairs of Piedmont had no &s;ooner taken this turn, than the Italians joined the Spani&s;h and impe|rial intere&s;t, and cardinal Pignatelli, a Neapolitan, was elected pontiff. He a&s;|&s;umed the name of Innocent, in honour of the la&s;t pope known by that appel|lation, and adopted all his maxims again&s;t the French monarch. When the German auxiliaries arrived, under the command of the elector of Bavaria, the confederates re&s;olved to give battle to Catinat; but he repa&s;&s;ed the Po, and &s;ent couriers to Ver&s;ailles to &s;ollicit a reinforcement. Then prince Eugene inve&s;ted Carmagnola, and carried on the &s;iege with &s;uch vigour, that in eleven days the garri&s;on capitulated. Mean while the marquis de Hoquincourt undertook the
<PB N="$7" REF="700">
conque&s;t of Montmelian, and reduced the town without much re&s;i&s;tance. The ca&s;tle, however, made &s;uch a vigorous defence, that Catinat marched thither in per&s;on; and, notwith&s;tanding all his efforts, the place held out till the &s;econd day of December, when it &s;urrendered on honourable con|ditions.</P>

<P>This &s;ummer produced nothing of importance on the Rhine. The French endeavoured to &s;urpri&s;e Mentz, by maintaining a corre&s;pondence with one of the emperor's commi&s;&s;ioners; but this being di&s;covered, their de&s;ign was fru&s;trated. The imperial army, under the elector of Saxony, pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in the neighbourhood of Manheim; and the French cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ame river at Philip&s;burg, reduced the town of Portzheim in the marqui&s;ate of Baden-Dour|lach. The execution of the &s;cheme, projected by the emperor for this cam|paign, was prevented by the death of his general the elector of Saxony, which happened on the &s;econd day of September. His affairs wore a more favourable a&s;pect in Hungary, where the Turks were totally defeated by prince Lewis of Baden on the banks of the Danube. The Imperiali&s;ts afterwards undertook the &s;iege of Great Waradin in Tran&s;ylvania; but this was turned into a blockade, and the place was not &s;urrendered till the following &s;pring. The Turks were &s;o di&s;pirited by the defeat, by which they had lo&s;t the grand vizir, that the emperor might have made peace upon very advantageous terms: but his pride and ambition over&s;hot his &s;ucce&s;s. He was weak, in&s;olent, and &s;uper&s;titious; he imagined that now the war of Ireland was almo&s;t extingui&s;hed, king Wil|liam, with the re&s;t of the allies, would be able to humble the French power, though he him&s;elf &s;hould not co-operate with heretics, whom he abhorred; and that, in the mean time, he &s;hould not only make an entire conque&s;t of Tran|&s;ylvania, but al&s;o carry his victorious arms to the gates of Con&s;tantinople, ac|cording to &s;ome ridiculous prophecy by which his vanity had been flattered. The Spani&s;h government was become &s;o feeble, that, rather than be at the ex|pence of defending the Netherlands, it offered to deliver the whole country to king William, either as monarch of England or &s;tadtholder of the United Pro|vinces. He declined this offer, becau&s;e he knew the people would never be re|conciled to a prote&s;tant government: but he propo&s;ed that the Spaniards &s;hould confer the admini&s;tration of Flanders upon the elector of Bavaria, who was am|bitious of &s;ignalizing his courage, and able to defend the country with his own troops and trea&s;ure. This propo&s;al was reli&s;hed by the court of Spain: the emperor imparted it to the elector, who accepted the office without he&s;itation; and he was immediately declared governor of the Low-Countries by the council of &s;tate at Madrid. King William, after his return from the army, continued &s;ome time at the Hague, &s;ettling the operations of the en&s;uing campaign; and embarking in the Mae&s;e, landed in England on the nineteenth day of October.</P>

<P>Before we explain the proceedings in parliament, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give a detail of the late tran&s;actions in Ireland. In the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on the French king had &s;ent a large &s;upply of provi&s;ion, cloaths, and ammu|nition, for the u&s;e of the Iri&s;h at Limerick, under the conduct of mon&s;ieur St. Ruth, accompanied by a good number of French officers, furni&s;hed with com|mi&s;&s;ions from king James, though St. Ruth i&s;&s;ued all his orders in the name of Lewis. Tyrconnel had arrived in January with three frigates and nine ve&s;&s;els, loaded with &s;uccours of the &s;ame nature; otherwi&s;e the Iri&s;h could not
<PB N="68" REF="710">
have been &s;o long kept together. Nor indeed could the&s;e &s;upplies prevent them from forming &s;eparate and independent bands of Rapparees, who plundered the country, and committed the mo&s;t &s;hocking barbarities. The lords ju&s;tices, in conjunction with general Ginckle, had taken every &s;tep their prudence could &s;ug|ge&s;t, to quiet the di&s;turbances of the country, and prevent &s;uch violence and rapine, of which the &s;oldiers in king William's army were not intirely innocent. The ju&s;tices had i&s;&s;ued proclamations, denouncing &s;evere penalties again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould countenance or conceal &s;uch acts of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion: they pro|mi&s;ed to protect all papi&s;ts who &s;hould live quietly within a certain frontier line; and Ginckle gave the catholic rebels to under&s;tand, that he was authorized to treat with them, if they were inclined to return to their duty. Before the armies took the field, &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes had been fought between parties; and the&s;e had always turned out &s;o unfortunate to the enemy, that their &s;pirits were quite depre&s;&s;ed, while the confidence of the Engli&s;h ro&s;e in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; IX.</HEAD>
<P>St. Ruth and Tyrconnel were joined by the Rapparees, and general Ginckle was reinforced by Mackay, with tho&s;e troops which had reduced the Highlanders in Scotland. He, in the beginning of June, marched from Mul|lingar to Ballymore, which was garri&s;oned by a thou&s;and men under colonel Bourke, who, when &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, returned an eva&s;ive an&s;wer. But, when a breach was made in the place, and the be&s;iegers began to make prepa|rations for a general a&s;&s;ault, his men layed down their arms$ and &s;ubmitted at di&s;cretion. The fortifications of this place being repaired and augmented, the general left a garri&s;on for its defence, and advanced to Athlone, &s;ituated on the other &s;ide of the Shannon, and &s;upported by the Iri&s;h army encamped almo&s;t under its walls. The Engli&s;h town, on the hither &s;ide of the river, was taken &s;word in hand; and the enemy broke down an arch of the bridge in their re|treat. Batteries were rai&s;ed again&s;t the Iri&s;h town; and &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts were made to force the pa&s;&s;age of the bridge, which was defended with great vigour. At length, it was re&s;olved, in a council of war, that a detach|ment &s;hould pa&s;s at a ford a little to the left of the bridge, though the river was deep and rapid, the bottom foul and &s;tony, and the pa&s;s guarded by a ba&s;|tion erected for that purpo&s;e. The forlorn hope con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ixty grenadiers in armour, headed by captain Sandys, and two lieutenants. They were &s;econded by another detachment, and this was &s;upported by &s;ix battalions of infantry. Never was a more de&s;perate &s;ervice, nor was ever exploit performed with more valour and intrepidity. They pa&s;&s;ed twenty a-brea&s;t, in the face of the enemy, through an ince&s;&s;ant &s;hower of balls, bullets, and grenades. Tho&s;e who followed them took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge, and laid planks over the broken arch. Pontoons were fixed at the &s;ame time, that the troops might pa&s;s in different places. The Iri&s;h were amazed, confounded, and abandoned the town in the utmo&s;t con&s;ter|nation; &s;o that, in half an hour, it was wholly &s;ecured by the Engli&s;h, who did not lo&s;e above fifty men in this attack. Mackay, Tetteau, and Talma&s;h, exhibited proofs of the mo&s;t undaunted courage in pa&s;&s;ing the river; and general Ginckle, for his conduct, intrepidity, and &s;ucce&s;s on this occa&s;ion, was created earl of Athlone. When St. Ruth was informed by expre&s;s, that the Engli&s;h had entered the river, he &s;aid, it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould pretend to take a town which he covered with his army; and that he would give a thou|&s;and pi&s;toles they would attempt to force a pa&s;&s;age. Sarsfield in&s;i&s;ted upon the
<PB N="69" REF="720">
truth of the intelligence, and pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;end &s;uccours to the town: he ridiculed this officer's fears, and &s;ome warm expo&s;tulation pa&s;&s;ed between them. Being at length convinced that the Engli&s;h were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, he ordered &s;ome detachments to drive them out again; but, the cannon of their own works being turned again&s;t them, they found the ta&s;k impracticable; and that very night their army decamped. St. Ruth, after a march of ten miles, took po&s;t at Aghrim, and having by draughts from garri&s;ons, augmented his army to five and twenty thou&s;and men, re&s;olved to hazard a deci&s;ive en|gagement.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; X.</HEAD>
<P>Ginckle having put Athlone in a po&s;ture of defence, pa&s;&s;ed the Shannon, and marched up to the enemy, determined to give them battle, though his forces did not exceed eighteen thou&s;and; and the Iri&s;h were po&s;ted in a very advan|tageous &s;ituation. St. Ruth had made an admirable di&s;po&s;ition, and taken every precaution that military &s;kill could &s;ugge&s;t. His center extended along a ri&s;ing-ground, uneven in many places, inter&s;ected with banks and ditches, joined by lines of communication, and fronted by a large bog almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able. His right was fortified with intrenchments, and his left &s;ecured by the ca&s;tle of Agh|rim. He harangued his army in the mo&s;t pathetic &s;train, conjuring them to exert their courage in defence of their holy religion, in the extirpation of here&s;y, in recovering their antient honours and e&s;tates, and in re&s;toring a pious king to the throne, from whence he had been expelled by an unnatural u&s;urper. He em|ployed the prie&s;ts to enforce his exhortations, to a&s;&s;ure the men that they might depend upon the prayers of the church; and that, in ca&s;e they &s;hould fall in battle, the &s;aints and angels would convey their &s;ouls to heaven. They are &s;aid to have &s;worn upon the &s;acrament, that they would not de&s;ert their colours, and to have received an order that no quarter &s;hould be given to the French heretics in the army of the prince of Orange. Ginckle had encamped on the Ro&s;com|mon &s;ide of the river Suc, within three miles of the enemy; and, after having reconnoitred their po&s;ture, re&s;olved, with the advice of a council of war, to at|tack them on Sunday the twelfth day of July. The nece&s;&s;ary orders being given, the army pa&s;&s;ed the river at two fords and a &s;tone-bridge, and advancing to the edge of the great bog, began about twelve o'clock to force the two pa&s;|&s;ages, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s the ground on the other &s;ide. The enemy fought with &s;urpri&s;ing fury, and the hor&s;e were &s;everal times repul&s;ed; but, at length, the troops upon the right carried their point by means of &s;ome field-pieces. The day was now &s;o far advanced, that the general determined to po&s;tpone the battle till next morning; but, perceiving &s;ome di&s;order among the enemy, and fearing they would decamp in the night, he altered his re&s;olution, and ordered the attack to be renewed. At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, the left wing of the Engli&s;h ad|vanced to the right of the Iri&s;h, from whom they met with &s;uch a warm and ob&s;tinate reception, that it was not without the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing efforts of courage and per&s;everance, that they at length obliged them to give ground; and even that they lo&s;t by inches. St. Ruth &s;eeing them in danger of being overpowered, immediately detached &s;uccours to them from his center and left wing. Mackay no &s;ooner perceived them weakened by the&s;e detachments, than he ordered three battalions to &s;kirt the bog, and attack them on the left, while the center advanced through the middle of the mora&s;s, the men wading up to the wa&s;te in mud and water. After they had reached the other &s;ide, they found them&s;elves obliged
<PB N="70" REF="730">
to a&s;cend a rugged hill, fenced with hedges and ditches; and the&s;e were lined with mu$queteers, &s;upported at proper intervals with &s;quadrons of cavalry. They made &s;uch a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance, and fought with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the a$$ailants were repul&s;ed into the middle of the bog with great lo&s;s; and St. Ruth exclaimed, "Now will I drive the Engli&s;h to the gates of Dublin." In this critical conjuncture, Talma&s;h came up with a fre&s;h body to &s;u&s;tain them, ral|lied the broken troops, and renewed the charge with &s;uch vigour, that the Iri&s;h gave way in their turn, and the Engli&s;h recovered the ground they had lo&s;t, though they found it impo&s;&s;ible to improve their advantage. Mackay brought a body of hor&s;e and dragoons to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the left wing; and fir&s;t turned the tide of battle in favour of the Engli&s;h. Major$general Rouvigny, who had behaved with great gallantry during the whole action, advanced with five regiments of cavalry to &s;upport the center, when St. Ruth perceiving his de|&s;ign, re&s;olved to fall upon him in a dangerous hollow way, which he was obliged to pa&s;s. For this purpo&s;e he began to de&s;cend Kircommodon-hill with his whole re&s;erve of hor&s;e; but, in his way was killed by a cannon-ball. His troops immediately halted; and his guards retreated with his body. His fate di&s;pirited the troops, and produced &s;uch confu&s;ion as Sarsfield could not remedy; for though he was next in command, he had been at variance with St. Ruth &s;ince the affair at Athlone, and was ignorant of the plan he had concerted. Rou|vigny having pa&s;&s;ed the hollow way without oppo&s;ition, charged the enemy in flank; and bore down all before him with &s;urpri&s;ing impetuo&s;ity: the center redoubled their efforts, and pu&s;hed the Iri&s;h to the top of the hill; and then their whole line giving way at once from right to left, threw down their arms. The foot fled towards a bog in their rear, and their hor&s;e took the route by the highway to Loughneagh: both were pur&s;ued by the Engli&s;h cavalry, who for four miles made a terrible &s;laughter. In the battle, which la&s;ted two hours, and pur&s;uit, above four thou&s;and of the enemy were &s;lain, and &s;ix hundred taken, together with all their baggage, tents, provi&s;ion, ammunition, and artillery, nine and twenty pair of colours, twelve &s;tandards, and almo&s;t all the arms of the in|fantry. In a word, the victory was deci&s;ive; and not above eight hundred of the Engli&s;h were killed upon the field of battle. The vanqui&s;hed retreated in great confu&s;ion to Limerick, where they re&s;olved to make a final &s;tand, in hope of receiving &s;uch &s;uccours from France as would either enable them to retrieve their affairs, or obtain good terms from the court of England. There Tyrcon|nel died of a broken heart, after having &s;urvived his authority and reputation, and incurred the contempt of the French, as well as the hatred of the Iri&s;h, whom he had advi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the new government, rather than totally ruin them|&s;elves and their families.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XI</HEAD>
<P>Immediately after the battle, detachments were &s;ent to reduce Por|tumny, Bonnachar, and Moor-ca&s;tle, con&s;iderable pa&s;&s;es on the Shannon, which were accordingly &s;ecured. Then Ginckle advanced to Galway, which he &s;um|moned to &s;urrender; but, he received a defiance from lord Dillon and general D'U&s;&s;one, who commanded the garri&s;on. The trenches were immediately opened; a fort which commanded the approaches to the town, was taken by a&s;&s;ault; &s;ix regiments of foot, and four &s;quadrons of hor&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed the river on pontoons; and the place being wholly inve&s;ted, the governor thought proper to capitulate. The garri&s;on marched out with the honours of war, and was allowd
<PB N="71" REF="740">
&s;afe-conduct to Limerick. Ginckle directed his march to the &s;ame town, which was the only po&s;t of con&s;equence that now held out for king James. Within four miles of the place he halted, until the heavy cannon could be brought from Athlone. Hearing that Lutterel had been &s;eized by the French general D'U&s;|&s;one, and &s;entenced to be &s;hot for having propo&s;ed to &s;urrender, he &s;ent a trum|pet to tell the commander, that if any per&s;on &s;hould be put to death for &s;uch a propo&s;al, he would make retaliation on the Iri&s;h pri&s;oners. On the twenty|fifth day of Augu&s;t, the enemy were driven from all their advanced po&s;ts: cap|tain Cole, with a &s;quadron of &s;hips, &s;ailed up the Shannon, and his frigates an|chored in &s;ight of the town. On the twenty-&s;ixth day of the month the batte|ries were opened, and a line of contravallation was formed: while the Iri&s;h army lay encamped on the other &s;ide of the river on the road to Killalow, and the fords were guarded with four regiments of their dragoons. On the fifth day of Sep|tember, after the town had been almo&s;t laid in ruins by the bombs, and large breaches made in the walls by the battering cannon; the guns were di&s;mounted, the out-forts evacuated, and &s;uch other motions made as indicated a re&s;olution to abandon the &s;iege. The enemy expre&s;&s;ed their joy in loud acclamations; but this was of &s;hort continuance. In the night the be&s;iegers began to throw a bridge of pontoons over the river, about a mile higher up than the camp; and this work was fini&s;hed before morning. A con&s;iderable body of hor&s;e and foot had pa&s;&s;ed when the alarm was given to the enemy, who were &s;eized with &s;uch con&s;ternation, that they threw down their arms and betook them&s;elves to flight, leaving behind them their tents, baggage, two pieces of cannon, and one &s;tand|ard. The bridge was immediately removed nearer the town, and fortified; all the fords and pa&s;&s;es were &s;ecured; and the batteries continued firing ince&s;&s;antly till the twenty-&s;econd day of the month, when Ginckle pa&s;&s;ed over with a di|vi&s;ion of the army, and fourteen pieces of cannon. About four in the afternoon, the grenadiers attacked the forts that commanded Thomond-bridge, and carried them &s;word in hand, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance. The garri&s;on had made a &s;ally from the town to &s;upport them; and this detachment was driven back with &s;uch precipitation, that the French officer on command in that quarter, fearing the Engli&s;h would enter pell-mell with the fugitives, ordered the bridge to be drawn up, leaving his own men to the fury of a victorious enemy. Six hundred were killed; two hundred taken pri&s;oners, including many officers; and a good number was drowned in the Shannon.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XII.</HEAD>
<P>Then the Engli&s;h made a lodgment within ten paces of the bridge|foot; and the Iri&s;h &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;urrounded on all &s;ides, determined to ca|pitulate. General Sarsfield and colonel Wahop &s;ignified their re&s;olution to Scravenmore and Rouvigny: ho&s;tages were exchanged; a negotiation was im|mediately begun, and ho&s;tilities cea&s;ed on both &s;ides of the river. The lords|ju&s;tices arrived in the camp on the fir&s;t day of October; and on the fourth the capitulation was executed, extending to all the places in the kingdom that were &s;till in the hands of the Iri&s;h. The Roman catholics were re&s;tored to the en|$oyment of &s;uch liberty in the exerci&s;e of religion as was con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of Ireland, and conformable with that which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the reign of Charles II. All per&s;ons whatever were entitled to the protection of the&s;e laws, and re&s;tored to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates, privileges, and immunities, upon their &s;ubmitting to the pre&s;ent government, and taking the oath of allegiance

to their maje&s;ties king William and queen Mary, excepting, however, certain per&s;ons who were forfeited or exiled. This article even extended to all mer|chants of Limerick, or any other garri&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Iri&s;h, who happened to be abroad, and had not bore arms &s;ince the declaration in the fir&s;t year of the pre&s;ent reign, provided they &s;hould return within the term of eight months. All the per&s;ons compri&s;ed in this and the foregoing article, were indulged with a general pardon of all attainders, outlawries, trea&s;ons, mi&s;pri&s;ions of trea&s;on, pre|munires, felonies, tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and other crimes and mi&s;demeanours what&s;oever, committed &s;ince the beginning of the reign of James II$ and the lords-ju&s;tices promi&s;ed to u&s;e their be&s;t endeavours towards the rever&s;al of &s;uch attainders and outlawries as had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t any of them in parliament. In order to allay the violence of party, and extingui&s;h private animo&s;ities, it was agreed, that no per&s;on &s;hould be &s;ued or impleaded on either &s;ide, for any tre&s;pa&s;s, or made ac|countable for the rents, tenements, lands, or hou&s;es, he had received or enjoyed &s;ince the beginning of the war. Every nobleman and gentleman comprized in the&s;e articles, was authorized to keep a &s;word, a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, and a gun for his defence or amu&s;ement. The inhabitants of Limerick and other garri&s;ons, were permitted to remove their goods and chattels, without &s;earch, vi&s;itation, or payment of duty. The lords-ju&s;tices promi&s;ed to u&s;e their be&s;t endeavours, that all per&s;ons comprehended in this capitulation, &s;hould for eight months be pro|tected from all arre&s;ts and executions for debt or damage: they undertook, that their maje&s;ties &s;hould ratify the&s;e articles within the &s;pace of eight months; and u&s;e their endeavours that they might be ratified and confirmed in parliament. The &s;ub&s;equent article was calculated to indemnify colonel John Brown, who&s;e e&s;tate and effects had been &s;eized for the u&s;e of the Iri&s;h army, by Tyrconnel and Sarsfield, which la&s;t had been created lord Lucan by king James, and was now mentioned by that title. All per&s;ons were indulged with free leave to remove with their families and effects to any other country, except England and Scot|land. All officers and &s;oldiers in the &s;ervice of king James, comprehending even the Rapparees, willing to go beyond &s;ea, were at liberty to march in bo|dies to the places of embarkation, to be conveyed to the continent with the French officers and troops. They were furni&s;hed with pa&s;&s;ports, convoys, and carriages by land and water; and general Ginckle engaged to provide &s;eventy &s;hips, if nece&s;&s;ary, for their tran&s;portation, with two men of war for the ac|commodation of their officers, and to &s;erve as a convoy to the fleet. It was &s;tipulated, That the provi&s;ions and forage for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence &s;hould be payed for on their arrival in France: and, That ho&s;tages &s;hould be given for this indem|nification, as well as for the return of the &s;hips: That all the garri&s;ons &s;hould march out of their re&s;pective towns and fortre&s;&s;es, with the honours of war: That the Iri&s;h &s;hould have liberty to tran&s;port nine hundred hor&s;es: and, That tho&s;e who &s;hould choo&s;e to &s;tay behind, might di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves according to their own fancy, after having &s;urrendered their arms to &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioners as the general &s;hould appoint: That all pri&s;oners of war &s;hould be &s;et at liberty on both &s;ides: That the general &s;hould provide two ve&s;&s;els to carry over two different per&s;ons to France, with intimation of this treaty; and that none of tho&s;e who were willing to quit the kingdom, &s;hould be detained on account of debt, or any other pretence. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of the famous treaty of Li|merick, which the Iri&s;h Roman catholics con&s;ider as the great charter of their

civil and religious liberties. The town of Limerick was &s;urrendered to Ginckle; but both &s;ides agreed, that the two armies &s;hould intrench them&s;elves, until the Iri&s;h &s;hould embark, that no di&s;orders might ari&s;e from a communication.</P>

<P>The prote&s;tant &s;ubjects of Ireland were extremely di&s;gu&s;ted at the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions made in favour of vanqui&s;hed rebels, who had exerci&s;ed &s;uch acts of cruelty and rapine. They complained, That they them&s;elves, who had &s;uffered for their loyalty to king William, were neglected, and obliged to &s;it down with their lo&s;&s;es, while their enemies, who had &s;hed &s;o much blood in oppo&s;ing his government, were indemnified by the articles of the capitulation, and even favoured with particular indulgences. They were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the honours of war; they were tran&s;ported at the government's expence, to fight again&s;t the Engli&s;h in foreign countries: an honourable provi&s;ion was made for the Rapparees, who were profe&s;&s;ed banditti; the Roman catholic in|tere&s;t in Ireland obtained the &s;anction of regal authority; attainders were over|looked, forfeitures annulled, pardons extended, and laws &s;et a&s;ide, in order to effect a pacification. Ginckle had received orders to put an end to the war at any rate, that William might convert his whole influence and attention to the affairs of the continent. When the articles of capitulation were ratified, and ho&s;tages exchanged for their being duly executed, about two thou&s;and Iri&s;h foot and three hundred hor&s;e, began their march for Cork, where they propo&s;ed to take &s;hipping for France, under the conduct of Sarsfield; but, three regiments refu&s;ing to quit the kingdom, delivered up their arms; and di&s;per&s;ed to their former habitations. Tho&s;e who remained at Limerick embarked on the &s;e|venth day of November, in French tran&s;ports; and &s;ailed immediately to France, under convoy of a French &s;quadron which had arrived in the bay of Dingle immediately after the capitulation was &s;igned. Twelve thou&s;and men cho&s;e to undergo exile from their native country, rather than &s;ubmit to the government of king William. When they arrived in France, they were wel|comed by a letter from James, who thanked them for their loyalty; told them they &s;hould &s;till &s;erve under his commi&s;&s;ion and command; and that the king of France had already given orders for their being new cloathed, and put into quarters of refre&s;hment.</P>

<P>The reduction of Ireland being thus completed, baron Ginckle re|turned to England, where he was &s;olemnly thanked by the hou&s;e of commons for his great &s;ervices, after he had been created earl of Athlone by his maje&s;ty. When the parliament met on the twenty-&s;econd day of October, the king in his &s;peech in&s;i&s;ted upon the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending a &s;trong fleet to &s;ea, early in the &s;ea&s;on, and of maintaining a con&s;iderable army to annoy the enemy abroad, as well as to protect the kingdom from in&s;ult and inva&s;ion; for which purpo&s;es, he &s;aid, &s;ixty-five thou&s;and men would be barely &s;ufficient. Each hou&s;e pre|&s;ented an addre&s;s of congratulation upon his maje&s;ty's &s;afe return to England, and the reduction of Ireland: they promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to the utmo&s;t of their power, in pro&s;ecuting the war with France; and, at the &s;ame time, drew up addre&s;&s;es to the queen, acknowledging her prudent admini&s;tration during his ma|je&s;ty's ab&s;ence. Notwith&s;tanding this appearance of cordiality and complai&s;ance, a &s;pirit of di&s;content had in&s;inuated it&s;elf into both hou&s;es of parliament, and even infected great part of the nation.</P>

<PB N="$4" REF="770">
to foreign connections, and the king's favour &s;o partially be&s;towed upon Dutchmen, in prejudice of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. They ob&s;erved, that the number of forces he demanded was con&s;iderably greater than that of any army which had ever been payed by the public, even when the nation was in the mo&s;t imminent danger: that, in&s;tead of contributing as allies to the maintenance of the war upon the continent, they had embarked as principals, and bore the greate&s;t part of the burthen, though they had the lea&s;t &s;hare of the profit. They even in&s;inuated, that &s;uch a &s;tanding army was more calculated to make the king ab&s;olute at home, than to render him formidable abroad; and the &s;ecret friends of the late king did not fail to enforce the&s;e in&s;inuations. They renewed their animadver&s;ions upon the di&s;agreeable part of his character: they d$elt upon his proud re&s;erve, his &s;ullen &s;ilence, his imperious di&s;po&s;ition, and his ba&s;e ingratitude, particularly to the earl of Marlborough, whom he had di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from all his employments, immediately after the &s;ignal exploits he had performed in Ireland. The di&s;grace of this nobleman was partly a&s;cribed to the freedom with which he had complained of the king's undervaluing his &s;er|vices, and partly to the intrigues of his wife, who had gained an a&s;cendancy over the prince&s;s Anne of Denmark, and is &s;aid to have employed her influence in &s;omenting a jealou&s;y between the two &s;i&s;ters. The malecontents of the whiggi&s;h faction, enraged to find their credit declining at court, joined in the cry which the Jacobites had rai&s;ed again&s;t the government. They &s;crupled not to &s;ay, that the arts of corruption were &s;hamefully practi&s;ed, to &s;ecure a majority in parliament: that the king was as tender of the prerogative as any of his predece&s;&s;ors had ever been: and, that he even ventured to admit Jaco|bites into his council, becau&s;e they were the known tools of arbitrary power. The&s;e reflections alluded to the earls of Roche&s;ter and Ranelagh, who, with Sir Edward Seymour, had been lately created privy-coun&s;ellors. Roche&s;ter enter|tained very high notions of regal authority; he propo&s;ed &s;everity as one of the be&s;t &s;upports of government; was clear in under&s;tanding, violent in his temper, and incorrupt in his principles. Ranelagh was a man of parts and plea&s;ure, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t plau&s;ible and winning addre&s;s; and was capable of tran&s;|acting the mo&s;t important and intricate affairs, in the mid&s;t of riot and exce&s;s. He had managed the revenue of Ireland in the reign of Charles II. enjoyed the office of pay-ma&s;ter in the army of king James; and maintained the &s;ame footing under the government of William and Mary. Sir Edward Seymour was the proude&s;t commoner in England, and the bolde&s;t orator that ever filled the &s;peaker's chair. He was intimately acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e, and knew every individual member &s;o exactly, that with one glance of his eye he could progno&s;ticate the fate of every motion. He had oppo&s;ed the court with great acrimony, que&s;tioned the king's title, cen&s;ured his conduct, and re|flected upon his character. Neverthele&s;s, he now became a pro&s;elyte, and was brought into the trea&s;ury.</P>

<P>The commons voted three millions, four hundred and eleven thou|&s;and, &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-five pounds for the u&s;e of the en&s;uing year; but, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of funds for rai&s;ing the&s;e &s;upplies, was retarded, partly by the ill humour of the oppo&s;ition, and partly by intervening affairs that diverted the attention of the commons. Several eminent merchants pre&s;ented a petition to the hou&s;e again&s;t the Ea&s;t-India company, charging them with manifold abu&s;es;
<PB N="75" REF="780">
at the &s;ame time, a counter-petition was delivered by the company, and the affair referred to the examination of a committee appointed for that purpo&s;e. After a minute enquiry into the nature of the complaints, the commons voted certain regulations with re&s;pect to the &s;tock and the traffic; and re&s;olved to petition his maje&s;ty, that, according to the &s;aid regulations, the Ea&s;t-India company &s;hould be incorporated by charter. The committee was ordered to bring in a bill for this e&s;tabli&s;hment; but divers petitions being pre&s;ented again&s;t it, and the company's an&s;wers proving un&s;atisfactory, the hou&s;e addre&s;&s;ed the king to di&s;&s;olve it, and grant a charter to a new company. He &s;aid it was an affair of great importance to the trade of the kingdom; therefore he would con&s;ider the &s;ubject, and in a little time return a po&s;itive an&s;wer. The parliament was like|wi&s;e amu&s;ed by a pretended con&s;piracy of the papi&s;ts in Lanca&s;hire, to rai&s;e a rebellion, and re&s;tore James to the throne. Several per&s;ons were &s;eized, and &s;ome witne&s;&s;es examined; but, nothing appeared to ju&s;tify the information. At length, one Fuller, a pri&s;oner in the King's-bench, offered his evidence, and was brought to the bar of the hou&s;e of commons, where he produced &s;ome papers. He obtained a blank pa&s;s from the king for two per&s;ons, who, he &s;aid, would come from the continent to give evidence. He was afterwards exa|mined at his own lodgings, where he affirmed, that colonel Thomas Delaval, and James Hayes, were the witne&s;&s;es for whom he had procured the pa&s;s and the protection. Search was made for them according to his direction; but no &s;uch per&s;ons were found. Then the hou&s;e declared Fuller a notorious impo&s;tor, cheat, and fal&s;e accu&s;er. He was, at the reque&s;t of the commons, pro&s;ecuted by the attorney-general, and &s;entenced to &s;tand in the pillory; a di&s;grace which he accordingly undewent.</P>

<P>A bill for regulating trials in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on having been layed a&s;ide by the lords in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, was now again brought upon the carpet, and pa&s;&s;ed the lower hou&s;e. The de&s;ign of this bill was, to &s;ecure the &s;ub|ject from the rigours to which he had been expo&s;ed in the late reigns. It pro|vided, That the pri&s;oner &s;hould be furni&s;hed with a copy of his indictment, as al&s;o of the pannel ten days before his trial: and, That his witne&s;&s;es &s;hould be examined upon oath, as well as tho&s;e of the crown. The lords, in their own behalf added a clau&s;e, enacting, That upon the trial of any peer or peere&s;s, for trea&s;on or mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, all the peers who have a right to &s;it and vote in parliament, &s;hould be duly &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the trial: That this notice &s;hould be given twenty days before the trial: and, That every peer &s;o &s;ummoned, and appearing, &s;hould vote upon the occa&s;ion$ The commons re|jected this amendment; and a free conference en&s;ued. The point was argued with great vivacity on both &s;ides, which &s;erved only to inflame the di&s;pute, and render each party the more tenacious of their own opinion. After three con|ferences that produced nothing but animo&s;ity, the bill was dropped; for, the commons re&s;olved to bear the hard&s;hips of which they complained, rather than be relieved at the expence of purcha&s;ing a new privilege to the lords; and with|out this advantage the peers would not contribute to their relief.</P>

<P>The next object that engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the lower hou&s;e$ was the mi&s;carriage of the fleet during the &s;ummer's expedition. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el, who commanded at &s;ea, having been joined by a Dutch &s;quadron, &s;ailed in que&s;t of the enemy; but, as the French king had received undoubted intelligence,
<PB N="76" REF="790">
that the combined &s;quadrons were &s;uperior to his navy in number of &s;hips and weight of metal, he ordered Tourville to avoid an engagement. This officer acted with &s;uch vigilance, caution, and dexterity, as baffled all the endeavours of Ru&s;&s;el, who was moreover perplexed with ob&s;cure and contra|dictory orders. Neverthele&s;s, he crui&s;ed all &s;ummer either in the channel or in &s;oundings, for the protection of the trade, and in particular &s;ecured the home|ward$bound Smyrna fleet, in which the Engli&s;h and Dutch had a joint con|cern, amounting to four millions &s;terling. Having &s;coured the channel and run along great part of the French coa&s;t, he returned to Torbay in the beginning of Augu&s;t, and received fre&s;h orders to put to &s;ea again, notwith&s;tanding his repeated remon&s;trances again&s;t expo&s;ing large &s;hips to the &s;torms that always blow about the time of the equinox. He therefore &s;ailed back to &s;oundings, where he continued crui&s;ing till the &s;econd day of September, when he was overtaken by a violent tempe&s;t, which drove him into the channel, and obliged him to make for the port of Plymouth. The weather being hazy, he reached the Sound with great difficulty; the Coronation, a &s;econd-rate, foundered at anchor off the Ram-Head; the Harwich, a third-rate, bulged upon the rocks, and pe|ri&s;hed; two others ran a&s;hore, but were got off with little damage; the whole fleet was &s;cattered and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. The nation murmured at the &s;uppo&s;ed mi&s;|conduct of the admiral, and the commons &s;ubjected him to an inquiry: but, when they examined his papers, orders, and in&s;tructions, they perceived he had adhered to them with great punctuality, and thought proper to drop the pro&s;e|cution, out of tenderne&s;s to the mini&s;try. Then the hou&s;e took into con&s;idera|tion, &s;ome letters which had been intercepted in a French &s;hip taken by Sir Ralph Delaval. Three of the&s;e are &s;aid to have been written by king James, and the re&s;t &s;ealed with his &s;eal. They related to the plan of an in&s;urrection in Scotland and in the northern parts of England; and Legg lord Dartmouth, with one Crew, being mentioned in them as agents and abettors in the de&s;ign, warrants were immediately i&s;&s;ued again&s;t them. Crew ab&s;conded, but lord Dartmouth was committed to the Tower. Lord Pre&s;ton was examined touch|ing &s;ome cyphers which they could not explain, and pretending ignorance, was impri&s;oned in Newgate, from whence, however, he &s;oon obtained his relea&s;e. The funds for the &s;upplies of the en&s;uing year being e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;everal acts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The laws enacted in this &s;e$$$on were the&s;e: an act for abrogating the oath of &s;upremacy in Ireland, and appointing other oaths; an act for taking away clergy from &s;ome offenders, and bringing others to puni&s;hment; an act again&s;t deer-f$ealing; an act for repairing the highways, and &s;ettling the ra$$s of carriage of goods; an act $or the relief of creditors again&s;t fraudnlent $word$ an act for explaining and &s;upplying the defects of former laws for the &s;ettlement of the poor; an act for the encouragement of the breed|ing and feeding of cattle; and an act for a&s;cer|taining the tythes of hemp and flax.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ed relating to dome&s;tic regulations, the king, on the twenty-fourth day of February, clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;hort &s;peech, thanking the parliament for their demon&s;trations of affection in the liberal &s;upplies they had granted, and communicating his intention of repairing &s;peedily to the continent. Then the two hou&s;es, at his de&s;ire, adjourned them&s;elves to the twelfth day of April, and the parliament was afterwards prorogued to the twenty-ninth day of May, by proclamation <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, Dr. Welwood, a Scotti&s;h phy&s;ician, was taken into cu&s;tody, and reprimanded at the bar of the hou&s;e of commons, for having reflected upon that hou&s;e in a weekly paper intitled Mercurius Reformatus; but, as it was written in defence of the government, the king appointed him one of his phy&s;icians in or|dinary. At this period Charles Montague, after|wards earl of Halifax, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the hou&s;e of commons by his fine talents and elo|cution.

<P>The king had &s;uffered &s;o much in his reputation by his complai&s;ance to the pre&s;byterians of Scotland, and was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with the conduct of that &s;tubborn &s;ect of religioni&s;ts, that he thought proper to admit &s;ome prelati&s;ts into the admini&s;tration. John&s;ton, who had been &s;ent envoy to the elector of Brandenburg, was recalled, and, with the ma&s;ter of Stair, made joint &s;ecretary of Scotland; Melvill, who had declined in his importance, was made lord privy-&s;eal of that kingdom; Tweedale was con&s;tituted lord chancellor; Craw|furd retained the office of pre&s;ident in the council; and Lothian was ap|pointed high commi&s;&s;ioner to the general a&s;&s;embly. The parliament was ad|journed to the fifteenth day of April, becau&s;e it was not yet compliant enough to be a&s;&s;embled with &s;afety; and the epi&s;copal clergy were admitted to a &s;hare of the church-government. The&s;e mea&s;ures, in&s;tead of healing the divi&s;ions, &s;erved only to inflame the animo&s;ity of the two parties. The epi&s;copalians triumphed in the king's favour, and began to treat their antagoni&s;ts with in&s;o|lence and &s;corn; the pre&s;byterians were incen&s;ed to &s;ee their friends di&s;graced, and their enemies di&s;tingui&s;hed by the royal indulgence. They in&s;i&s;ted upon the authority of the law, which happened to be upon their &s;ide: they became more than ever &s;our, &s;urly, and implacable; they refu&s;ed to concur with the prelati&s;ts, or abate in the lea&s;t circum&s;tance of di&s;cipline; and the a&s;&s;embly was di&s;&s;olved, without any time or place a&s;&s;igned for the next meeting. The pre&s;|byterians pretended an independent right of a&s;&s;embling annually, even without a call from his maje&s;ty; they therefore adjourned them&s;elves, after having prote&s;ted again&s;t the di&s;&s;olution. The king re&s;ented this mea&s;ure as an in&s;o|lent inva&s;ion of the prerogative, and conceived an aver&s;ion to the whole &s;ect, who in their turn began to lo&s;e all re&s;pect for his per&s;on and government.</P>

<P>As the Highlanders were not yet totally reduced, the earl of Brai|dalbin undertook to bring them over, by di&s;tributing &s;ums of money among their chiefs; and fifteen thou&s;and pounds were remitted from England for this purpo&s;e. The clans being informed of this remittance, &s;u&s;pected that the earl's de&s;ign was to appropriate to him&s;elf the be&s;t part of the money, and when he began to treat with them made &s;uch extravagant demands, that he found his &s;cheme im|practicable. He was therefore obliged to refund the &s;um he had received; and he re&s;olved to wreak his vengeance with the fir&s;t opportunity, on tho&s;e who had fru&s;trated his intention. He who chiefly th warted his negotiation was Mac|donald of Glencoe; and his oppo&s;ition aro&s;e from a private circum&s;tance, which ought to have had no effect upon a treaty that regarded the public weal. Macdonald had plundered the lands of Braidalbin during the cour&s;e of ho&s;ti|lities; and this nobleman in&s;i&s;ted upon being indemnified for his lo&s;&s;es, from the other's &s;hare of the money which he was employed to di&s;tribute. The High|lander not only refu&s;ed to acquie&s;ce in the&s;e terms, but, by his influence among the clans, defeated the whole &s;cheme, and the earl in revenge devoted him to de&s;truction. King William had by proclamation offered an indemnity to all

tho&s;e who had been in arms again&s;t him, provided they would &s;ubmit and take the oaths by a certain day; and this was prolonged to the end of the pre&s;ent year, with a denunciation of military execution again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould hold out after the end of December. Macdonald, intimidated by this declaration, repaired on the very la&s;t day of the month to Fort-William, and de&s;ired that the oaths might be tendered to him by colonel Hill governor of that fortre&s;s. As this officer was not ve&s;ted with the power of a civil magi&s;trate, he refu&s;ed to admini&s;ter them; and Macdonald &s;et out immediately for Inverary, the county|town of Argyle. Though the ground was covered with &s;now and the weather inten&s;ely cold, he travelled with &s;uch diligence, that the term pre&s;cribed by the proclamation was but one day elap&s;ed when he reached the place, and ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Sir Colin Campbell &s;heriff of the county, who, in con&s;idera|tion of his di&s;appointment at Fort-William, was prevailed upon to admini&s;ter the oaths to him and his adherents.

<P>Braidalbin had repre&s;ented Macdonald at court as an incorrigible rebel, and a ruffian inured to blood&s;hed and rapine, who would never be obedient to the laws of his country, nor live peaceably under any &s;overeign. He ob&s;erved that he had payed no regard to the proclamation; and propo&s;ed that the go|vernment &s;hould &s;acrifice him to the quiet of the kingdom, in extirpating him, with his family and dependents, by military execution. His advice was &s;upported by the &s;ugge&s;tions of the other Scotti&s;h mini&s;ters; and the king, who&s;e chief virtue was not humanity, &s;igned a warrant for the de&s;truction of tho&s;e unhappy people, though it does not appear that he knew of Macdonald's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. An order for this barbarous execution, &s;igned and counter-&s;igned by his ma|je&s;ty's own hand, being tran&s;mitted to the ma&s;ter of Stair, &s;ecretary for Scotland, he &s;ent particular directions to Living&s;tone, who commanded the troops in that kingdom, to put the inhabitants of Glencoe to the &s;word, charging him to take no pri&s;oners, that the &s;cene might be more terrible. In the month of Fe|bruary captain Campbell of Glenlyon, by virtue of an order from major Dun|can&s;on, marched into the valley of Glencoe, with a company of &s;oldiers belong|ing to Argyle's Highland regiment, on pretence of levying the arrears of the land-tax and hearth-money. When Macdonald demanded whether they came as friends or enemies, he an&s;wered as friends, and promi&s;ed upon his honour that neither he nor his people &s;hould &s;u&s;tain the lea&s;t injury. In con&s;equence of this declaration, he and his men were received with the mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pi|tality, and lived fifteen days with the men of the valley, in all the ap|pearance of the mo&s;t unre&s;erved friend&s;hip. At length the fatal period approached. Macdonald and Campbell having pa&s;&s;ed the day together, parted about &s;even in the evening, with mutual profe&s;&s;ions of the warme&s;t affection. The younger Macdonald, perceiving the guards doubled, began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome treachery, and communicated his &s;u&s;picion to his brother; but neither he nor the father would harbour the lea&s;t doubt of Campbell's &s;in|cerity: neverthele&s;s, the two young men went forth privately to make further ob&s;ervations. They overheard the common &s;oldiers &s;ay they liked not the work; that though they would have willingly fought the Macdonalds of the Glen fairly in the field, they held it ba&s;e to murder them in cool blood, but that their officers were an&s;werable for the treachery. When the youths ha&s;ted

back to appri&s;e their father of the impending danger, they &s;aw the hou&s;e already &s;urrounded; they heard the di&s;charge of mu&s;kets, the &s;hrieks of women and children, and, being de&s;titute of arms, &s;ecured their own lives by imme|diate flight. The &s;avage mini&s;ters of vengeance had entered the old man's chamber, and &s;hot him through the head. He fell down dead in the arms of his wife, who died next day, di&s;tracted by the horror of her hu&s;band's fate. The laird of Auchintrincken, Macdonald's gue&s;t, who had three months before this period &s;ubmitted to the government, and at this very time had a protection in his pocket, was put to death without que&s;tion. A boy of eight years, who fell at Campbell's feet, imploring mercy, and offering to &s;erve him for life, was &s;tabbed to the heart by one Drummond, a &s;ubaltern officer. Eight and thirty per&s;ons &s;uffered in this manner, the greater part of whom were &s;urpri&s;ed in their beds, and hurried into eternity before they had time to implore the divine mercy. The de&s;ign was to butcher all the males under &s;eventy that lived in the valley, the number of whom amounted to two hundred: but &s;ome of the detachments did not arrive &s;oon enough to &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;es; &s;o that one hundred and &s;ixty e&s;caped. Campbell, having perpetrated this brutal ma&s;&s;acre, ordered all the hou&s;es to be burned, made a prey of all the cattle and effects that were found in the valley, and left the helple&s;s women and children, who&s;e fathers and hu&s;|bands he had murdered, naked and forlorn, without covering, food, or &s;hel|ter, in the mid&s;t of the &s;now that covered the whole face of the country, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix long miles from any inhabited place. Di&s;tracted with grief and horror, &s;urrounded with the &s;hades of night, &s;hivering with cold, and appalled with the apprehen&s;ion of immediate death from the &s;words of tho&s;e who had &s;acrificed their friends and kin&s;men, they could not endure &s;uch a complication of calamities, but generally peri&s;hed in the wa&s;te before they could receive the lea&s;t comfort or a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This barbarous ma&s;&s;acre, performed under the &s;anction of king William's authority, though it an&s;wered the immediate pur|po&s;e of the court, by &s;triking terror into the hearts of the Jacobite Highlanders, excited the horror of all tho&s;e who had not renounced every &s;entiment of humanity, and produced &s;uch an aver&s;ion to the government, as all the arts of a mini&s;try could never totally &s;urmount. A detail of the particulars was pub|li&s;hed at Paris with many exaggerations; and the Jacobites did not fail to ex|patiate upon every circum&s;tance, in dome&s;tic libels and private conver&s;ation. The king, alarmed at the outcry which was rai&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, ordered an inquiry to be &s;et on foot, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the ma&s;ter of Stair from his employ|ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.

While he was here employed in promoting the mea&s;ures of the grand confederacy, the French king re&s;olved to invade England in his ab&s;ence, and &s;eemed heartily engaged in the intere&s;t of James, who&s;e emi&s;&s;aries in Britain began to be&s;tir them|&s;elves with uncommon a&s;&s;iduity, in preparing the nation for his return One Lant, who was impri&s;oned on &s;u&s;picion of di&s;tributing his commi&s;&s;ions, had the good fortune to be relea&s;ed; and the papi&s;ts of Lanca&s;hire di&s;patched him to the court of St. Germains, with an a&s;&s;urance that they were in a condition to receive their old &s;overeign. He returned with advice that king James would certainly land in the &s;pring; and that colonel Parker and other officers &s;hould be &s;ent over with full in&s;tructions, touching their conduct at and before he king's arrival. Parker accordingly repaired to England, and made the J$$obites ac|quainted with the whole &s;cheme of a de&s;cent, which Lewis had actual$ concerted with the late king. He a&s;&s;ured them, that their lawful &s;overeign would once more vi&s;it his Briti&s;h dominions, at the head of thirty thou&s;and effective men, to be embarked at La Hogue; that the tran&s;ports were already prepared, and a &s;trong &s;quadron equipped for their convoy; he therefore exhorted them to be &s;peedy and &s;ecret in their preparations, that they might be in readine&s;s to take arms and co-operate in effecting his re&s;toration. This officer, and one John&s;on, a prie&s;t, are &s;aid to have undertaken the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of king William; but, be|fore they could execute their de&s;ign, he &s;et &s;ail for Holland.</P>

<P>Mean while, James addre&s;&s;ed a letter to &s;everal lords, who had been formerly members of his council, as well as to divers ladies of quality and di&s;|tinction, intimating the pregnancy of his queen, and requiring them to attend as witne&s;&s;es at the labour. He took notice of the injury his family and honour had &s;u&s;tained, from the cruel a&s;per&s;ions of his enemies concerning the birth of his &s;on; and as providence had now favoured him with an opportunity of refuting the calumny of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;umed that the queen was incapable of child-bear|ing, he affored them, in the name of his brother the French king, as well as upon his own royal word, that they &s;hould have free leave to vi&s;it his court, and return after the labour <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letter was directed not only to privy|coun&s;ellors, but al&s;o to the $word$ of Somer|&s;et and Beaufort, the $word$ of $word$ the counte&s;&s;es of Derb$$ $word$ Rut and, $span$ and $word$ the ladies $word$ and Fretchville, the&s;e of Sir John Trevor &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons, Sir Edward Se m$ar, Sir Chri&s;topher Mu&s;grave, the $span$ Thomas Stamford lord mayor of London, Sir William A&s;t$ur&s;t and Sir Richard Le$ett the $word$ and $word$ to Dr. Chamber|lian the famous practitioner $word$ $word$.</NOTE>. This invitation, however, no per&s;on would venture to accept. He afterwards employed his em$&s;&s;aries in circulating a printed declaration, importing that the king of France had enabled him to make another effort to retrieve his crown; and that, although he was furni&s;hed with a number of troops &s;ufficient to untle the hands of his &s;ubjects, he did not intend to deprive them of their &s;hare in the glory of re&s;toring their lawful king and their ancient government. He exhorted the people to join his &s;tandard. He a&s;|&s;ured them that the foreign auxiliaries &s;hould behave with the mo&s;t regular di&s;|cipline, and be &s;ent back immediately after his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment.

with force, he neverthele&s;s offered to give all rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction to his &s;ub|jects who had been mi&s;led, and endeavoured to open their eyes with re&s;pect to the vain pretences of his adver&s;ary, who&s;e aim was not the reformation but the &s;ubver&s;ion of the government; that when he &s;aw him&s;elf de&s;erted by his army, betrayed by his mini&s;ters, abandoned by his favourites, and even his own chil|dren, and at la&s;t rudely driven from his own palace by a guard of in&s;olent fo|reigners; he had, for his per&s;onal &s;afety, taken refuge in France: that his re|treat from the malice and cruel de&s;igns of the u&s;urper had been con&s;trued into an abdication, and the whole con&s;titution of the monarchy de&s;troyed by a &s;et of men illegally a&s;&s;embled, who, in fact, had no power to alter the property of the meane&s;t &s;ubject. He expre&s;&s;ed his hope that by this time the nation had fairly examined the account, and from the lo&s;&s;es and enormous expence of the three la&s;t years, were convinced that the remedy was wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e; that the beginning, like the fir&s;t years of Nero's reign, would, in all probability, be found the milde&s;t part of the u&s;urpation, and the in&s;truments of the new e&s;tab|li&s;hment live to &s;uffer &s;everely by the tyranny they had rai&s;ed; that even, though the u&s;urpation &s;hould continue during his life, an indi&s;putable title would &s;urvive in his i&s;&s;ue, and expo&s;e the kingdom to all the mi&s;eries of a civil war. He not only &s;ollicited but commanded his good &s;ubjects to join him, according to their duty and the oaths they had taken. He forbade them to pay taxes or any part of the revenue to the u&s;urper. He promi&s;ed pardon and even rewards to all tho&s;e who &s;hould return to their duty, and to procure in his fir&s;t parliament an act of indemnity, with an exception of certain per&s;ons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e excepted were the duke of Ormond, the marquis of Winche&s;ter, the earls of Sunder|land, Bath, Danby, and Nottingham, the lords Newport, Delamere, Wilt&s;hire, Colche&s;ter, Corn|bury, Dunblain, and Churchill; the bi&s;hops of London and St. A&s;aph, Sir Robert Howard, Sir John Worden, Sir Samuel Grim&s;tone, Sir Stephen Fox, Sir George Treby, Sir Ba&s;il Dix|well, Sir James Oxenden, Dr. John Tillot&s;on, Dr. Gilbert Burnet, Francis Ru&s;&s;el, Richard Le|vi&s;on, John Trenchard, Charles Duncomb, ci|tizen of London; Edwards, Stapleton, and Hunt, fi&s;hermen, and all others who had offered per&s;o|nal indignities to him at Fever&s;ham; or had been concerned in the barbarous murder of John A&s;h|ton, Cro&s;s, or any others who had &s;uffered death for their loyalty; and all &s;pies or &s;uch as had be|trayed his councils, during his late ab&s;ence from England.</NOTE> whom he now enumerated.

He concluded with profe&s;&s;ions of re&s;ignation to the divine will, declaring, that all who &s;hould reject his offers of mercy, and appear in arms again&s;t him, would be an&s;werable to almighty God for all the blood that &s;hould be &s;pilt, and all

They likewi&s;e tran&s;mitted a li&s;t of the &s;hips that compo&s;ed the Engli&s;h fleet; and exhorted James to u&s;e his influence with the French king, that the count de Tourville might be ordered to attack them before they &s;hould be joined by the Dutch &s;quadron. It was in con&s;equence of this advice, that Lewis com|manded Tourville to fall upon the Engli&s;h fleet, even without waiting for the Toulon &s;quadron, commanded by the marquis D'Etrees. By this time James had repaired to La Hogue, and was ready to embark with his army, con&s;i&s;ting of a body of French troops, together with &s;ome Engli&s;h and Scotti&s;h refugees, and the regiments which had been tran&s;ported from Ireland by virtue of the ca|pitulation of Limerick.</P>

<P>The mini&s;try of England was informed of all the&s;e particulars, partly by &s;ome agents of James, who betrayed his cau&s;e, and partly by admiral Carter, who gave the queen to under&s;tand he had been tampered with; and was in&s;tructed to amu&s;e the Jacobites with a negotiation. King William no &s;ooner arrived in Holland, than he ha&s;tened the naval preparations of the Dutch, &s;o as that their fleet was ready for &s;ea &s;ooner than it was expected; and when he received the fir&s;t intimation of the projected de&s;cent, he detached general Tal|ma&s;h with three of the Engli&s;h regiments from Holland. The&s;e, reinforced with other troops remaining in England, were ordered to encamp in the neigh|bourhood of Port&s;mouth. The queen i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, commanding all papi&s;ts to depart from London and We&s;tmin&s;ter: the members of both hou&s;es of parliament were required to meet on the twenty-fourth day of May, that &s;he might avail her&s;elf of their advice in &s;uch a perilous conjuncture. War|rants were expedited for apprehending divers di&s;affected per&s;ons; and they withdrawing them&s;elves from their re&s;pective places of abode, a proclamation was publi&s;hed for di&s;covering and bringing them to ju&s;tice. The earls of Scar&s;|dale, Litchfield, and Newburgh, the lords Griffin, Forbes, Sir John Fenwick, Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe, and others, found means to elude the &s;earch. The earls of Huntingdon and Marlborough were &s;ent to the Tower: Edward Ridley, Knevitt, Ha&s;tings, and Robert Fergu&s;on, were impri&s;oned in Newgate. The bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter was confined to his own hou&s;e: the lords Brudenel and Fan|&s;haw were &s;ecured: the earls of Dunmore, Middleton, and Sir Andrew For|re&s;ter, were di&s;covered in a quaker's hou&s;e, and committed to pri&s;on, with &s;e|veral other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The trained-bands of London and We&s;t|min&s;ter were armed by the queen's direction, and &s;he reviewed them in per&s;on; admiral Ru&s;&s;el was ordered to put to &s;ea with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; and Carter, with a &s;quadron of eighteen &s;ail, continued to cruize along the French coa&s;t, to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy.</P>

<P>On the eleventh day of May, Ru&s;&s;el failed from Rye to St. Helen's, where he was joined by the &s;quadrons under Delavil and Carter. There he received a letter from the earl of Nottingham, intimating, that a re|port having &s;pread of the queen's &s;u&s;pecting the fidelity of the &s;ea-officers, her maje&s;ty ordered him to declare in her name, that &s;he repo&s;ed the mo&s;t intire confidence in their attachment; and believed the report was rai&s;ed by the ene|mies of the government. The flag-officers and captains forthwith drew up a very loyal and dutiful addre&s;s, which was graciou&s;ly received by the queen, and publi&s;hed for the &s;atisfaction of the nation. Ru&s;&s;el being reinforced by the Dutch &s;quadrons, commanded by Allemonde, Callembergh, and Vandergoes, &s;et &s;ail for the coa&s;t of France on the eighteenth day of May, with a fleet of ninety-nine &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates and fire-&s;hips. Next day about three o'clock in the morning, he di&s;covered the enemy, under the count de Tour|ville, and threw out the &s;ignal for the line of battle, which by eight o'clock was formed in good order, the Dutch in the van, the blue divi&s;ion in the rear, and the red in the center. The French fleet did not exceed &s;ixty-three &s;hips of the line, and as they were to windward, Tourville might have avoided an engage|ment; but, he had received a po&s;itive order to fight, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the Dutch and Engli&s;h &s;quadrons had not joined. Lewis indeed was appri&s;ed of their junction before they were de&s;cried by his admiral, to whom he di&s;patched a countermanding order by two &s;everal ve&s;&s;els; but, one of them was taken by the Engli&s;h, and the other did not arrive till the day after the engagement.</P>

<P>Tourville therefore, in obedience to the fir&s;t mandate, bore down along &s;ide of Ru&s;&s;el's own &s;hip, which he engaged at a very &s;mall di&s;tance. He fought with great fury till one o'clock, when his rigging and &s;ails being con&s;iderably damaged, his &s;hip, the Ri&s;ing-Sun, that carried one hundred and four cannon, was towed out of the line in great di&s;order. Neverthele&s;s, the engagement continued till three, when the fleets were parted by a thick fog. When this abated, the enemy were de&s;cried flying to the northward; and Ru&s;&s;el made the &s;ignal for cha&s;ing. Part of the blue &s;quadron came up with the enemy about eight in the evening, and engaged them half an hour, during which admiral Carter was mortally wounded. Finding him&s;elf in extremity, he exhorted his captain to fight as long as the &s;hip could &s;wim; and expired with great compo&s;ure. At length, the French bore away for Conquet-Road, having lo&s;t four &s;hips in this day's action. Next day about eight in the morning, they were di&s;covered crowding away to the we&s;tward, and the com|bined fleets cha&s;ed with all the &s;ails they could carry, until Ru&s;&s;el's foretop-ma&s;t came by the board. Though he was retarded by this accident, they &s;till con|tinued the pur&s;uit, and he anchored near Cape La Hogue. On the twenty|&s;econd of the month, about &s;even in the morning, part of the French fleet was perceived near the Race of Alderney, &s;ome at anchor, and &s;ome driving to the ea&s;tward with the tide of flood. He, and the &s;hips neare&s;t him, immediately &s;lipped their cables and cha&s;ed. The Royal-Sun having lo&s;t her ma&s;ts, ran a&s;hore near Cherbourg, where &s;he was burned by Sir Ralph Delaval, together with the Admirable, another fir&s;t-rate, and the Conquerant of eighty guns. Eighteen other &s;hips of their fleet ran into La Hogue, where they were attacked by Sir George Rooke, who de&s;troyed them, and a great number of tran&s;ports loaded with ammunition, in the mid&s;t of a terrible fire from the enemy, and in

fight of the Iri&s;h camp. Sir John A&s;hby, with his own &s;quadron and &s;ome Dutch &s;hips, pur&s;ued the re&s;t of the French fleet, which e&s;caped through the Race of Alderney, by &s;uch a dangerous pa&s;&s;age as the Engli&s;h could not at|tempt, without expo&s;ing their &s;hips to the mo&s;t imminent hazard. This was a very mortifying defeat to the French king, who had been &s;o long flattered with an uninterrupted &s;eries of victories; and reduced James to the lowe&s;t ebb of de&s;pondence, as it fru&s;trated the whole &s;cheme of his embarkation, and over|whelmed his friends in England with grief and de&s;pair. Some hi&s;torians alledge, that Ru&s;&s;el did not improve his victory with all advantages that might have been obtained before the enemy recovered of their con&s;ternation. They &s;ay, his affection to the &s;ervice was in a good mea&s;ure cooled by the di&s;grace of his friend the earl of Marlborough: that he hated the earl of Nottingham, by who&s;e canal he received his orders: and, that he adhered to the letter rather than the &s;pirit of his in&s;tructions. But this is a malicious imputation; and a very ungrateful return for his manifold &s;ervices to the nation. He acted in this whole expedition with the genuine &s;pirit of a Briti&s;h admiral. He plyed from the Nore to the Downs with a very &s;canty wind, through the dangerous &s;ands, contrary to the advice of all his pilots; and by this bold pa&s;&s;age effected a junction of the different &s;quadrons, which otherwi&s;e the French would have attacked &s;ingly, and perhaps defeated. He behaved with great gallantry dur|ing the engagement; he de&s;troyed about fifteen of the enemy's capital &s;hips; in a word, he obtained &s;uch a deci&s;ive victory, that during the remaining part of the war, the French would not hazard another battle by &s;ea with the Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>Ru&s;&s;el having ordered Sir John A&s;hby, and the Dutch admiral Callembergh, to &s;teer toward Havre de Grace, and endeavour to de&s;troy the remainder of the French fleet, &s;ailed back to St. Helen's, that the damaged &s;hips might be refitted, and the fleet furni&s;hed with fre&s;h &s;upplies of provi&s;ion and ammunition: but, his principal motive was to take on board a number of troops provided for a de&s;cent upon France, which had been projected by Eng|land and Holland, with a view to alarm and di&s;tract the enemy in their own dominions. The queen was &s;o plea&s;ed with the victory, that &s;he ordered thirty thou&s;and pounds to be di&s;tributed among the &s;ailors; medals to be &s;truck in ho|nour of the action; and the bodies of admiral Carter and captain Ha&s;tings, who had been killed in the battle, to be interred with great funeral pomp. In the latter end of July, &s;even thou&s;and men, commanded by the duke of Lein|&s;ter, embarked on board of tran&s;ports, to be landed at St. Maloe's, Bre&s;t, or Rochfort; and the nation conceived the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of this expedition. A council of war, con&s;i&s;sing of land and &s;ea-officers, being held on board the Breda, to deliberate upon the &s;cheme of the mini&s;try, the members unani|mou&s;ly agreed, that the &s;$a&s;on was too far advanced to put it in execution. Ne|verthele&s;s, the admiral ha$$ng detached Sir John A&s;hby with a &s;quadron, to intercept the remains of the Fr$nch f$eet in their pa&s;&s;age from St. Maloe's to Bre&s;t, &s;et &s;ail for La Hogue with the re&s;t of the fleet and tran&s;ports; but, in a few days the wind &s;$$$&s;ting he was obliged to return to St. Helen's.</P>

that &s;ea&s;on of the year. The de&s;ign was therefore layed a&s;ide; and the forces were tran&s;ported to Flanders. The higher the hopes of the nation had been rai&s;ed by this armament, the deeper they felt their di&s;appointment. A loud clamour was rai&s;ed again&s;t the mini&s;try, as the authors of this mi&s;carriage. The people complained, that they were plundered and abu&s;ed: that immen&s;e &s;ums were extorted from them by the mo&s;t grievous impo&s;itions: that by the infamous expedient of borrowing upon e&s;tabli&s;hed funds, their taxes were per|petuated: that their burdens would daily increa&s;e: that their trea&s;ure was either &s;quandered away in chimerical projects, or expended in foreign connexions, of which England was naturally independent. They were the more ex|cu&s;able for exclaiming in this manner, as their trade had grievou&s;ly &s;uffered by the French privateers, which &s;warmed in the channel. In vain the merchants had recour&s;e to the admiralty, which could not &s;pare particular convoys, while large fleets were required for the defence of the nation. The French king hav|ing nothing further to apprehend from the Engli&s;h armament, withdrew his troops from the coa&s;t of Normandy; and James returned in de&s;pair to St. Germain's, where his queen had been in his ab&s;ence delivered of a daughter, who was born in pre&s;ence of the archbi&s;hop of Paris, the keeper of the &s;eals, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction.</P>

<P>Lewis had taken the field in the latter end of May. On the twen|tieth day of that month he arrived at his camp in Flanders, with all the effemi|nate pomp of an A&s;iatic emperor, attended by his women and para&s;ites, his band of mu&s;ic, his dancers, his opera, and in a word, by all the mini&s;ters of luxury and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure. Having reviewed his army, which amounted to about one hundred and twenty thou&s;and men, he undertook the &s;iege of Namur, which he inve&s;ted on both &s;ides of the Sambre, with about one half of his army, while the other covered the &s;iege, under the command of Luxembourg-Namur is &s;ituated on the conflux of the Meu&s;e and the Sambre. The citadel was deemed one of the &s;tronge&s;t forts in Flanders, &s;trengthened with a new work contrived by the famous engineer Coehorn, who now defended it in per&s;on. The prince de Barba&s;on commanded the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of nine thou&s;and men. The place was well &s;upplied; and the governor knew that king William would make &s;trong efforts for its relief: &s;o that the be&s;ieged were animated with many concurring con&s;iderations. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e advantages, the a&s;&s;ailants carried on their attacks with &s;uch vigour, that in &s;even days after the trenches were opened the town capitulated, and the garri&s;on retired into the citadel. King William being joined by the troops of Brandenburgh and Liege, advanced to the Mehaigne, at the head of one hundred thou&s;and effective men, and encamped within cannon-&s;hot of Luxembourg's army, which lay on the other &s;ide of the river. That general, however, had taken &s;uch precautions, that the king of England could not interrupt the &s;iege, nor attack the Erench lines without great di&s;advantage. The be&s;iegers, encouraged by the pre&s;ence of their monarch, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;uperior abilities of Vauban their engineer, repeated their attacks with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the fort of Coehorn was &s;ur|rendered, after a very ob&s;tinate defence, in which he him&s;elf had been dan|gerou&s;ly wounded. The citadel being thus left expo&s;ed to the approaches of the enemy, could not long with&s;tand the violence of their operations. The two covered-ways were taken by a&s;&s;ault; and on the twentieth of May the go|vernor capitulated, to the un&s;peakable mortification of king William, who

Lewis having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, returned in triumph to Ver&s;ailles, where he was flat$$red with all the arts of adulation; while Wil$$am's reputation &s;uf|fered a little from his mi&s;carriage, and the prince of Barba&s;on incurred the &s;u&s;|picion of treachery or mi&s;conduct.</P>

<P>Luxembourg having placed a &s;trong garri&s;on in Namur, detached $word$ with a body of troops to La Bu&s;&s;iere, and with the re&s;t of his army en|camped at Soignies. The king of England &s;ent off detachments towards Liege and Ghent; and on the &s;ixth day of July po&s;ted him&s;elf at Genap, re&s;olved to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of retrieving his honour, by attacking the enemy. Having received intelligence that the French general was in motion, and in|tended to take po&s;t between St$enkirk and Enghien, he pa&s;&s;ed the river Senne, in order to anticipate his purpo&s;e; but, in &s;pite of all his diligence, Luxembourg gained his point; and William encamped at Lambeque, within &s;ix miles of the French army. Here he re&s;olved, in a council of war, to attack the enemy; and the di&s;po&s;ition was made for that purpo&s;e. The heavy baggage he ordered to be conveyed to the other &s;ide of the Senne; and one Millevoix, a detected &s;py, was compelled by menaces to mi&s;lead Luxembourg with fal&s;e intelligence, importing, that he needed not be alarmed at the motions of the allies, who in|tended next day to make a general forage. On the twenty-fourth day of July, the army began to move from the left, in two columns, as the ground would not admit of their marching in an extended front. The prince of Wirtemberg began the attack on the right of the enemy, at the head of ten battalions of Engli&s;h, Dani&s;h, and Dutch infantry; and he was &s;upported by a con&s;iderable body of Briti&s;h hor&s;e and foot, commanded by lieutenant-general Mackay. Though the ground was inter&s;ected by hedges, ditches, and narrow defiles, the prince marched with &s;uch diligence, that he was in a condition to begin the b$ttle about two in the afternoon, when he charged the French with &s;uch im|petu$$ity, that they were driven from their po&s;ts, and their whole camp became a &s;cene of tumult and confu&s;ion. Luxembourg tru&s;ting to the intelligence he had received, allowed him&s;elf to be &s;urpri&s;ed; and it required the full exertion of his &s;uperior talents, to remedy the con&s;equences of his neglect. He forth|with forgot a &s;evere indi&s;po&s;ition under which he happened to labour; he rallied his broken battalions; he drew up his forces in order of battle, and led them to the charge in per&s;on. The duke de Chartres, who was then in the fifteenth year of his age, the dukes of Bourbon and Vendome, the prince of Conti, and a great number of volunteers of the fir&s;t quality, put them&s;elves at the head of the hou&s;hold troops, and fell with great fury upon the Engli&s;h, who were very ill &s;upported by count Solmes, who commanded the center of the allies. The prince of Wirtemberg had taken one of the enemy's batteries, and actually pe|netrated into their lines; but finding him&s;elf in danger of being overpowered by numbers, he &s;ent an aid-de-camp twice to demand &s;uccours from Solmes, who derided his di&s;tre&s;s, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;Let us &s;ee what &s;port the&s;e Engli&s;h bull|dogs will make.&endq;</Q> At length, when the king &s;ent an expre&s;s order, com|manding him to &s;u&s;tain the left wing, he made a motion with his hor&s;e, which could not act while his infantry kept their ground; and the Briti&s;h troops, with a few Dutch and Danes, bore the whole brunt of the engagement. They fought
<PB N="87" REF="900">
with &s;urpri&s;ing courage and per&s;everance again&s;t dreadful odds; and the event of the battle continued doubtful, until Boufflers rejoined the French army with a great body of dragoons. The allies could not &s;u&s;tain the additional weight of this reinforcement, before which they gave way, though the retreat was made in tolerable order; and the enemy did not think proper to pro&s;ecute the advan|tage they had gained. In this action the confederates lo&s;t the earl of Angus, general Mackay, Sir John Lanier, Sir Robert Douglas, and many other gallant officers, together with about three thou&s;and men left dead on the &s;pot, a like number wounded or taken, a great many colours and &s;tandards, and &s;everal pieces of cannon.</P>

<P>The French reaped no &s;olid advantage from their victory, which co&s;t them about three thou&s;and men, including the prince of Turenne, the mar|quis de Bellefonds, Tilladet, and Ferma&ccedil;on, with many officers of di&s;tinction: as for Millevoix the &s;py, he was hanged on a tree, on the right wing of the allied army. King William retired unmole&s;ted to his own camp; and notwith&s;tand|ing all his overthrows, continued a re&s;pectable enemy, by dint of invincible for|titude, and a genius fruitful in re&s;ources. That he was formidable to the French nation, even in the mid&s;t of his ill &s;ucce&s;s, appears from divers undeniable te&s;|timonies, and from none more than from the extravagance of joy expre&s;&s;ed by the people of France, on occa&s;ion of this unimportant victory. When the princes who &s;erved in the battle returned to Paris, the roads through which they pa&s;&s;ed were almo&s;t blocked up with multitudes; and the whole air re&s;ounded with ac|clamation. All the ornaments of the fa&s;hion peculiar to both &s;exes, adopted the name of Steenkirk; every individual who had been per&s;onally engaged in the action, was revered as being of a &s;uperior &s;pecies; and the tran&s;ports of the women ro&s;e almo&s;t to a degree of frenzy.</P>

<P>The French mini&s;try did not intirely depend upon the fortune of the war for the execution of their revenge again&s;t king William. They likewi&s;e employed a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to deprive him of life, in the mo&s;t treacherous manner. When Louvois died, his &s;on the marquis de Barbe&s;ieux, who &s;ucceeded him in his office of &s;ecretary, found among his papers the draught of a &s;$heme for this purpo&s;e; and immediately revived the de&s;ign by means of the chevalier de Grandval, a captain of dragoons in the &s;ervice. He and colonel Parker engaged one Dumont, who undertook to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate king William. Madame de Mainte|non and Paparel, payma&s;ter to the French army, were privy to the &s;cheme, which they encouraged; and the con&s;pirators are &s;aid to have obtained an audience of king James, who approved of their undertaking, and a&s;&s;ured them of his protection; but, that unfortunate monarch was unju&s;tly charged with the guilt of countenancing the intended murder, as they communicated nothing to him but an attempt to &s;eize the per&s;on of the prince of Orange. Dumont actu|ally inli&s;ted in the confederate army, that he might have the better opportu|nity to &s;hoot the king of England when he &s;hould ride out to vi&s;it the lines, while Grandval and Parker repaired to the French camp, with orders to Luxembourg to furni&s;h them with a party of hor&s;e for the re&s;cue of Dumont, after the blow &s;hould be &s;truck. Whether this man's heart failed him, or he could not find the opportunity he de&s;ired, after having re&s;ided &s;ome weeks in the camp of the allies, he retired to Hanover; but &s;till corre&s;ponded with Grandval and Barbe|&s;ieux. This la&s;t admitted one Leefdale, a Dutch baron, into the &s;ecret, and likewi&s;e imparted it to mon&s;ieur Chanlais, quarter ma&s;ter-general of the French army,
<PB N="88" REF="910">
who animated Grandval and Leefdale with the promi&s;e of a con&s;iderable reward; and promi&s;ed to co-operate with Parker for bringing off Dumont, for he &s;till per|&s;i&s;ted in his undertaking. Leefdale had been &s;ent from Holland on purpo&s;e to dive to the bottom of this con&s;piracy, in con&s;equence of advice given by the Briti&s;h envoy at Hanover, where Dumont had dropped &s;ome hints that alarmed his &s;u&s;picion. The Dutchman not only in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the confidence of the con&s;pirators, but likewi&s;e inveigled Grandval to Eyndhoven, where he was apprehended. Under&s;tanding that Dumont had already di&s;covered the de&s;ign to the duke of Zell, and that he him&s;elf had been betrayed by Leefdale, he freely confe&s;&s;ed all the particulars, without enduring the torture; and being found guilty by a court-martial, was executed as a traitor.</P>

<P>About this period the duke of Lein&s;ter arrived at O&s;tend with the troops which had been embarked at St. Helen's. He was furni&s;hed with cannon &s;ent down the Meu&s;e from Mae&s;tricht; he was reinforced by a large detachment from the king's camp at Gramont, under the command of general Talma&s;h. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Furnes, was joined by the earl of Portland and Mr. D'Auverquerque, and a di&s;po&s;ition was made for inve&s;ting Dunkirk; but, on further deliberation, the enterprize was thought very dangerous, and therefore layed a&s;ide. Furnes and Dixmuyde lately reduced by brigadier Ram&s;ay, were &s;trengthened with new works, and &s;ecured with &s;trong garri&s;ons. The cannon were &s;ent back, and the troops returning to O&s;tend, reimbarked for England. This fruitle&s;s expedition, added to the inglorious i&s;&s;ue of the cam|paign, increa&s;ed the ill humour of the Briti&s;h nation. They taxed William with having lain inactive at Gramont with an army of one hundred thou&s;and men, while Luxembourg was po&s;ted at Courtray with half that number. They &s;aid, if he had found the French lines too &s;trong to be forced, he might have pa&s;&s;ed the Scheld higher up, and not only layed the enemy's conque&s;ts under contribu|tion, but even marched into the bowels of France; and they complained that Furnes and Dixmuyde were not worth the &s;ums expended in maintaining their garri&s;ons. On the twenty-&s;ixth day of September king William left the army under the command of the elector of Bavaria, and repaired to his hou&s;e at Loo: in two days after his departure the camp at Gramont was broke up; the infantry marched to Marienkerke, and the hor&s;e to Gaure. On the &s;ixteenth day of October the king receiving intelligence, that Boufflers had inve&s;ted Charleroy, and Luxembourg taken po&s;t in the neighbourhood of Cond&eacute;, ordered the troops to be in&s;tantly rea&s;&s;embled between the village of Ixells and Halle, with de&s;ign to rai&s;e the &s;iege; and repaired to Bru&s;&s;els, where he held a council of war, in which the proper mea&s;ures were concerted. Then he returned to Holland, leaving the command with the elector of Bavaria, who forthwith began his march for Charleroy. At his approach Boufflers abandoned the &s;iege, and moved towards Philipville. The elector having reinforced the place, and thrown &s;upplies into Aeth, di&s;tributed his forces into winter-quarters. Then Luxembourg, who had cantoned his army between Cond&eacute;, Leuze, and Tournay, returned to Paris, leaving Boufflers to command in his ab&s;ence.</P>

<P>The allies had been un&s;ucce&s;sful in Flanders, and they were not fortunate in Germany. The landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el undertook the &s;iege of Eberemburg, which however he was obliged to abandon. The duke de Lorges, who commanded the French forces on the Rhine, &s;urpri&s;ed, defeated, and took the duke of Wirtemberg, who had po&s;ted him&s;elf with four thou&s;and hor&s;e near
<PB N="89" REF="920">
Eidel&s;heim to check the progre&s;s of the enemy. Count Tallard, having inve&s;ted Rhinefeld, the landgrave marched to its relief with &s;uch expedition, that the French were obliged to de&s;i&s;t, and retreat with con&s;iderable damage. The elector of Saxony had engaged to bring an army into the field; but, he com|plained that the emperor left the burden of the war with France upon the princes, and converted his chief power and attention to the campaign in Hun|gary. A jealou&s;y and mi&s;under&s;tanding en&s;ued; Schoening, the Saxon general, in his way to the hot-baths at Dablitz in Bohemia, was &s;eized by the emperor's order, on &s;u&s;picion of having maintained a private corre&s;pondence with the enemy; and very warm expo&s;tulations on this &s;ubject pa&s;&s;ed between the courts of Vienna and Dre&s;den. Schoening was detained two years in cu&s;tody; and at length relea&s;ed, on condition that he &s;hould never be employed again in the empire. The war in Hungary produced no event of importance. The mi|ni&s;try of the Ottoman Porte was di&s;tracted by factions, and the &s;eraglio threatened with tumults. The people were tired of maintaining an un&s;ucce&s;sful war: the vizir was depo&s;ed; and in the mid&s;t of this confu&s;ion, the garri&s;on of Great Waradin, which had been blocked up by the Imperiali&s;ts during the whole winter, &s;urrendered by capitulation. Lord Paget, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;a|dor at Vienna, was &s;ent to Con&s;tantinople with powers to mediate a peace; but the terms offered by the emperor were rejected at the porte: the Turki&s;h army lay upon the defen&s;ive, and the &s;ea&s;on was &s;pent in a fruitle&s;s negotiation.</P>

<P>The pro&s;pect of affairs in Piedmont was favourable for the allies; but the court of France had brought the pope to an accommodation, and began to tamper with the duke of Savoy. Mr. Chanlais was &s;ent to Turin with advantageous propo&s;als, which, however, the duke would not accept, becau&s;e he thought him&s;elf intitled to better terms, con&s;idering that the allied army in Piedmont amounted to fifty thou&s;and effective men, while Catinat's forces were not &s;ufficient to defend his conque&s;ts in that country. In the month of July the duke marched into Dauphin&eacute;, where he plundered a number of village, and reduced the fortre&s;s of Guille&s;tre; then pa&s;&s;ing the river Darance, he inve&s;ted Ambrun, which, after a &s;iege of nine days, &s;urrendered on capitu|lation, and laid all the neighbouring towns under contribution. Here duke Schomberg, who commanded the auxiliaries in the Engli&s;h pay, publi&s;hed a declaration, in the name of king William, inviting the people to join his &s;tan|dard; a&s;&s;uring them that his ma&s;ter had no other de&s;ign in ordering his troops to invade France, but that of re&s;toring the noble&s;&s;e to their ancient &s;plendour, their parliaments to their former authority, and the people to their ju&s;t privileges. He even offered his protection to the clergy, and to u&s;e his endeavours for reviv|ing the edict of Nantes, which had been guaranteed by the kings of England. The&s;e offers, however, produced little effect; and the Germans ravaged the whole country, in revenge for the cruelties which the French had committed in the Palatinate. The allied army advanced from Ambrun to Gap, on the fron|tiers of Provence; and this place &s;ubmitted without oppo&s;ition. The inhabi|tants of Grenoble, the capital of Dauphin&eacute;, and even of Lyons, were over|whelmed with con&s;ternation; and a fairer opportunity of humbling France could never occur, as that part of the kingdom had been left almo&s;t quite de|&s;encele&s;s: but this was fatally neglected, either from the &s;pirit of di&s;&s;en&s;ion, which began to prevail in the allied army, or from the indi&s;po&s;ition of the duke

of Savoy, who was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox in the mid&s;t of this expedition; or, la&s;tly, to his want of &s;incerity, which was &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected.

<P>The prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Germany acquired an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength, by the creation of a ninth electorate in favour of Enne&s;t Augu&s;tus duke of Hanover. He had, by this time, renounced all his connexions with France, and engaged to enter heartily into the intere&s;t of the allies, in con&s;ideration of his obtaining the electoral dignity. King William exerted him&s;elf &s;o vigorou&s;ly in his behalf at the court of Vienna, that the emperor agreed to the propo&s;al, in ca&s;e the con&s;ent of the other electors could be procured. This a&s;&s;ent, however, was $word$ by the importunities of the king of England, whom he dur&s;t not $word$ He was blindly bigot$ed to the religion of Rome, and con&s;equently $ver&s;e to anew creation that would weaken the catholic intere&s;t in the electoral college. He therefore employed his e$i&s;&s;anies to thwart the duke's mea&s;ures. Some pro$e&s;tant princes oppo&s;ed him from motives of jealou&s;y; and the French king u&s;ed all his artifices and influence to prevent the elevation of the hou&s;e of Hanover. When the duke had &s;urmounted all this oppo&s;ition, &s;o far as to gain o$$r a majority of the electors, new objections were &s;tarted. The emperor &s;ug|ge&s;ted that another popish electorate &s;hould be created, to balance the advantage which the Lutherans would reap from that of Hanover; and he propo&s;ed that $word$ &s;hould be rai&s;ed to the &s;ame dignity: but violent oppo&s;ition was made to this expedient, which would have ve&s;ted the emperor with a double vote in the electoral college. At length, after a tedious negotiation, the duke of Han|over, on the nineteenth day of December, was honoured with the inve&s;tature as elector of Brun&s;wick; created great mar&s;hal of the empire, and did homage to the emperor: neverthele&s;s, he was not yet admitted into the college, becau&s;e he had not been able to procure the unanimous con&s;ent of all the electors <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of September, the &s;hock of onearthquake was &s;elt in London and many other parts of England, as well as in France, Germany, and the Netherlands.

<P>WHILE king William &s;eemed wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the affairs of the continent, England was di&s;tracted by dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ion, and over&s;pread with vice, corruption, and profanity. Over and above the Jacobites, there was a &s;et of malecontents, who&s;e number daily increa&s;ed. They not only murmured at the grievances of the nation, but compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed elabo|rate di&s;&s;ertations upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. The&s;e made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions upon the people, already irritated by heavy burdens, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in their trade, and di&s;ap|pointed in their &s;anguine expectations, that the queen thought it nece&s;&s;ary to check the progre&s;s of tho&s;e writers, by i&s;&s;uing out a proclamation offering a reward to &s;uch as would di&s;cover &s;editious libellers. The earl of Marl|borough had been committed to the Tower, on the information of one Robert Young, a pri&s;oner in Newgate, who had forged that nobleman's hand-writing, and contrived the &s;cheme of an a&s;&s;ociation in favour of king James, to which he affixed the names of the earls of Marlborough and Sali&s;bury, Sprat, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, the lord Cornbury, and Sir Ba&s;il Firebrace. One of his emi&s;|&s;aries had found means to conceal this paper in a certain part of the bi&s;hop's hou&s;e at Bromley in Kent, where it was found by the king's me&s;&s;engers, who &s;ecured the p$elate in con&s;equence of Young's information. But he vindicated him&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of the whole council, and the forgery of the informer was detected by the confe&s;&s;ion of his accomplice. The bi&s;hop obtained his re|lea&s;e immediately, and the earl of Marlborough was admitted to bail in the court of king's bench.</P>

<P>So many per&s;ons of character and di&s;tinction had been impri&s;oned du|ring this reign, upon the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion, that the di&s;contented part of the na|tion had &s;ome rea&s;on to in&s;inuate, they had only exchanged one tyrant for another. They affirmed, that the Habeas Corpus act was either in&s;ufficient to protect the &s;ubject from fal&s;e impri&s;onment, or had been &s;hamefully mi&s;u&s;ed. They expatiated upon the lo&s;s of &s;hips, which had lately fallen a prey to the enemy; the con&s;umption of &s;eamen; the neglect of the fi&s;heries; the interrup|tion of commerce, in which the nation was &s;upplanted by her allies, as well as invaded by her enemies; the low ebb of the kingdom's trea&s;ure exhau&s;ted in hiring foreign bottoms, and paying foreign troops to fight foreign quarrels; the &s;laughter of the be&s;t and brave&s;t of their countrymen, who&s;e blood had been lavi&s;hly &s;pilt in &s;upport of connexions with which they ought to have had no concern. They demon&s;trated the mi&s;chiefs that nece&s;&s;arily aro&s;e from the un|&s;ettled &s;tate of the nation. They ob&s;erved that the government could not be duly e&s;tabli&s;hed, until a &s;olemn declaration &s;hould confirm the legality of that tenure by which their maje&s;ties po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the throne; that the &s;tructure of par|liaments was deficient in point of &s;olidity, as they exi&s;ted intirely at the plea&s;ure of the crown, which would u&s;e them no longer than they &s;hould be found ne|ce&s;&s;ary in rai&s;ing &s;upplies for the u&s;e of the government. They exclaimed again&s;t the practice of quartering &s;oldiers in private hou&s;es, contrary to the ancient laws of the land, the petition of rights, and the &s;ub&s;equent act pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of the &s;econd Charles. They enumerated among their grievances the vio|lation of property, by pre&s;&s;ing tran&s;port &s;hips into the &s;ervice, without &s;ettling any fund of payment for the owners; the condition of the militia, which was equally burthen&s;ome and u&s;ele&s;s; the flagrant partiality in favour of allies, who
<PB N="93" REF="960">
carried on an open commerce with France, and &s;upplied the enemy with nece&s;|&s;aries, while the Engli&s;h laboured under the &s;evere&s;t prohibitions, and were in effect the dupes of tho&s;e very powers whom they protected. They dwelt upon the mini&s;try's want of conduct, fore&s;ight, and intelligence, and inveighed again&s;t their ignorance, in&s;olence, and neglect, which were as pernicious to the nation as if they had formed a de&s;ign of reducing it to the lowe&s;t ebb of di&s;grace and de&s;truction. By this time indeed, public virtue was become the object of ridi|cule, and the whole kingdom was over&s;pread with immorality and corruption; towards the increa&s;e of which many concurring circum&s;tances happened to con|tribute. The people were divided into three parties, namely, the Williamites, the Jacobites, and the di&s;contented revolutioners; and the&s;e factions took all oppor|tunities to thwart, to expo&s;e, and to ridicule the mea&s;ures and principles of each other: &s;o that patrioti&s;m was laughed out of doors, as an hypocrital pretence. This contention e&s;tabli&s;hed a belief, that every man con&s;ulted his own private intere&s;t at the expence of the public: a belief that &s;oon grew into a maxim almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally adopted. The practice of bribing a majority in parliament had a per|nicious influence upon the morals of all ranks of people from the candi|date to the lowe&s;t borough-elector. The expedient of e&s;tabli&s;hing funds of credit for rai&s;ing &s;upplies to defray the expence of government, threw large pre|miums and &s;ums of money into the hands of low, &s;ordid u&s;urers, brokers, and jobbers, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by the name of the Monied intere&s;t. In|toxicated by this flow of wealth, they affected to rival the luxury and magnifi|cence of their &s;uperiors; but, being de&s;titute of &s;entiment and ta&s;te, to con|duct them in their new career, they ran into the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and illiberal extra|vagancies. They layed a&s;ide all decorum; became lewd, in&s;olent, intemperate, and riotous. Their example was caught by the vulgar. All principle, and even decency was gradually bani&s;hed; talent lay uncultivated, and the land was deluged with a tide of ignorance and pro&s;ligacy.</P>

<P>King William having a&s;certained the winter-quarters of the army, and concerted the operations of the en&s;uing campaign with the &s;tates-general, and the mini&s;ters of the allies, &s;et &s;ail for England on the fifteenth day of October, on the eighteenth landed at Yarmouth, was met by the queen at Newhall, and pa&s;&s;ed through the city of London to Ken&s;ington, amid&s;t the acclamations of the po|pulace. He received a congratulatory addre&s;s from the lord-mayor and aldermen, with whom he dined in public by invitation. A day of thank&s;giving was appointed for the victory obtained at &s;ea. The lute&s;tring company was e&s;tabli&s;hed by patent, and the parliament met on the fourth day of November. The hou&s;e of lords was deeply infected with di&s;content, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure proceeded from the di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the queen and her &s;i&s;ter the prince&s;s of Denmark, who under|went every mortification that the court could inflict. Her guards were taken away; all honours which had been payed to her rank by the magi&s;trates of Bath, where &s;he &s;ometimes re&s;ided; and even by the mini&s;ters of the church where &s;he attended at divine &s;ervice, were di&s;continued, by the expre&s;s order of her maje&s;ty. Her cau&s;e was naturally e&s;pou&s;ed by tho&s;e noblemen who had ad|hered to her in her former conte&s;t with the king, about an independent &s;ettle|ment; and the&s;e were now reinforced by all the friends of the earl of Marlbo|rough, united by a double tie; for, they re&s;ented the di&s;grace and confinement of that lord; and thought it their duty to &s;upport the prince&s;s Anne under a
<PB N="94" REF="970">
per&s;ecution incurred by an attachment to his counte&s;s. The earl of Shrew&s;bury lived in friend&s;hip with Marlborough, and thought he had been ungratefully treated by the king; the marquis of Hallifax befriended him, from oppo&s;ition to the min$&s;try; the earl of Mulgrave, for an opportunity to di&s;play his talents, and acquire that con&s;ideration which he thought due to his merit. Devon&s;hire, Montague, and Bradford joined in the &s;ame cau&s;e, from principle; and the &s;ame pretence was u&s;ed by the earls of Stamford, Monmouth, Warrington, and other Whigs; though in effect they were actuated by jealou&s;y and re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e by whom they had been &s;upplanted. As for the Jacobites, they gladly con|tributed their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to promote any &s;cheme that had a tendency to embroil the admini&s;tration.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>The king, in his &s;peech to parliament, thanked them for their la&s;t &s;up|plies, congratulated them upon the victory obtained at &s;ea, condoled them on the b$d &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign by land, magnified the power of France, re|pre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of maintaining a great force to oppo&s;e it; and demanded &s;ub$$dies equal to the occa&s;ion. He expre&s;&s;ed his reluctance to load them with additional burthens, which, he &s;aid, could not be avoided without expo&s;ing his kingdom to inevitable de&s;truction. He de&s;ired their advice towards le&s;&s;ening the inconvenience of exporting money for the payment of the forces. He inti|mated a de&s;ign of making a de&s;cent upon France; declared he had no aim but to make them a happy people; and that he would again chearfully expo&s;e his life for the welfare of the nation. The lords, after an adjournment of three days, began with great warmth to a&s;&s;ert their privileges, which they conceived had been violated in the ca&s;es of the earl of Marlborough, and the other noble|men, who had been apprehended, committed to pri&s;on, and afterwards admitted to b$il by the court of king's-bench. The&s;e circum&s;tances being fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a violent debate, the hou&s;e order$d lord Lucas con&s;table of the Tower, to produce the warrants of commitment, and the clerk of the king's-bench to de|liver the a$$idavit of Aaron Smith, the court-&s;ollicitor, upon which the lords had been remanded to pri&s;on. At the &s;ame time, the whole affair was referred to a committee, impowered to &s;end for p$r&s;ons, papers, and reco$ds. The judges were ordered to attend: Aaron Smith was examined touching the evidence again&s;t the committed lords. The committee reported their general re&s;olution, which produced a vehement di&s;pute. The opinion of the judges was un&s;ati&s;|factory to both parties: the debate was referred to a committee of the whole hou&s;e, in which it was re&s;olved, and d$clared, as the &s;en&s;e of that a&s;&s;embly, that in pur&s;uance of the Habeas-corpus act, it was the duty of the judges and goal|delivery, to di&s;charge the pri&s;oner on bail, if committed for high-trea&s;on, unle&s;s it be made appear, upon oath, that there are two witne&s;&s;$s again&s;t the &s;aid pri|&s;oner, who cannot be produced in that term, &s;e&s;&s;ions, or general goal-delivery. They likewi&s;e re&s;olved, it was the intention of the &s;aid &s;tatute, that in ca&s;e there &s;hould be more than one pri&s;oner to be bailed or remanded, there mu&s;t be oath made, that there are two witne&s;&s;es again&s;t each pri&s;oner, otherwi&s;e he cannot be remanded to pri&s;on. The&s;e re&s;olutions were entered in the books, as &s;tanding directions to all future judges, yet not without great oppo&s;ition from the court|members. The next debate turned upon the manner in which the impri&s;oned lords &s;hould be &s;et at liberty. The conte&s;t became &s;o warm, that the courtiers began to be afraid, and propo&s;ed an expedient, which was put in practice.
<PB N="95" REF="980">
The hou&s;e adjourned to the &s;eventeenth day of the month, and at its next meet|ing was given to under&s;tand, that the king had di&s;charged the impri&s;oned noble|men. After another warm debate, a formal entry was made in the journals, importing, That the hou&s;e being informed of his maje&s;ty's having given di|rections for di&s;charging the lords under bail in the king's-bench, the debate about that matter cea&s;ed. The re&s;entment of the peers being thus allayed, they proceeded to take his maje&s;ty's &s;peech into c$n&s;ideration.</P>

<P>The commons having voted an addre&s;s of thanks, and another, praying that his maje&s;ty's foreign alliances &s;hould be layed before them, voted a bill for regulating trials in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on. They pa&s;&s;ed a vote of thanks to admiral Ru&s;&s;el, his officers and &s;eamen, for the victory they had obtained; then proceeded to an inquiry, Why that victory had not been pur&s;ued? Why the de&s;cent had not been made? And why the trade had not been better pro|tected from the enemy's crui&s;ers? The admiral having ju&s;tified his own con|duct, they commanded the lords of the admiralty to produce copies of all the letters and orders which had been &s;ent to the admiral: they ordered Ru&s;&s;el to lay before them his an&s;wers; and the commi&s;&s;ioners of the tran&s;ports, victuallers, and office of ordnance, to deliver in an account of their proceed|ings. Then they pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es to the king and queen, acknowledging the favour of God in re&s;toring him to his people; congratulating him upon his deliverance from the &s;nares of his open and &s;ecret enemies; and a&s;&s;uring him they would, according to his maje&s;ty's de&s;ire in his mo&s;t gracious &s;peech, be always ready to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the &s;upport of his government. The queen was thanked for her gracious and prudent admini&s;tration during his maje&s;ty's ab&s;ence: they congratulated her on their &s;ignal deliverance from a bold and cruel de&s;ign formed for their de&s;truction, as well as on the glorious victory which her fle$t had gained; and they a&s;&s;ured her that the grateful &s;en&s;e they had of their happine&s;s under her government, &s;hould always be manife&s;ted in con&s;tant returns of duty and obedience.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VI.</HEAD>
<P>After this formal compliment, the hou&s;e, in&s;tead of proceeding to the &s;upplies, in&s;i&s;ted upon peru&s;ing the treaties, public accounts, and e&s;ti$ates, that they might be in a condition to advi&s;e, as well as to a&s;&s;i&s;t his maje&s;ty. Being indulged with tho&s;e papers, they pa&s;&s;ed a previous vote, that a &s;upply &s;hould be given; then they began to concert their articles of advice. Some of the members loudly complained of partiality to foreign generals; and par|ticularly reflected upon the in&s;olence of count Solmes, and his mi&s;conduct at Steenkirk. After &s;ome warm altercation, the hou&s;e re&s;olved one article of their advice &s;hould be, That his maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to fill up &s;uch va|cancies as &s;hould happen among the general officers, with &s;uch only as were natives of his dominions; and that the commander in chief of the Engli&s;h &s;hould be an Engli&s;hman. Their next re&s;olution implied, That many of the great affairs of the government having been for &s;ome time pa&s;t un&s;ucce&s;sfully managed, the hou&s;e &s;hould advi&s;e his maje&s;ty to prevent &s;uch mi&s;chiefs for the future, by employing men of knowledge, ability, and integrity. Individual members inveighed bitterly again&s;t cabinet councils, as a novelty in the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem of government, by which the privy$council was ju&s;tled out of its pro|vince. They complained that all the grievances of the nation proceeded from the vitious principles of the mini&s;try: they ob&s;erved, that he who oppo&s;ed the
<PB N="96" REF="990">
e&s;tabli&s;hment, could not be expected to &s;upport it with zeal. The earl of Nottingham was mentioned by name; and the hou&s;e re&s;olved that his maje&s;ty &s;hould be advi&s;ed, to employ in his councils &s;uch per&s;ons only who&s;e prin|ciples obliged them to &s;upport his rights again&s;t the late king, and all other pretenders. Marlborough's intere&s;t &s;till predominated among the commons. His friend Ru&s;&s;el acquitted him&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of the hou&s;e, and &s;hifted the blame of the mi&s;carriage upon his enemy the earl of Nottingham, by declaring that twenty days elap&s;ed between his fir&s;t letter to that nobleman and his lord&s;hip's an&s;wer. The earl's friends, of whom there was a great number in the hou&s;e, e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e with great vigour, and even recri|minated upon Ru&s;&s;el; &s;o that a very violent debate en&s;ued. Both parties agreed that there had been mi&s;management in the &s;cheme of a de&s;cent. It was moved, that one cau&s;e of the mi&s;carriage was the want of giving timely and nece&s;&s;ary orders, by tho&s;e to whom the management of the affair was com|mitted. The hou&s;e divided, and it was carried in the affirmative by one voice only. At the next &s;itting of the committee, Sir Richard Temple propo&s;ed they &s;hould con&s;ider how to pay the forces abroad, by means of Engli&s;h manufactures, without exporting money. They re&s;olved that the hou&s;e &s;hould be moved to appoint a committee to take this expedient into con&s;ideration. Sir Francis Winnington was immediately called upon to leave the chair; and the &s;peaker re&s;umed his place. All that had been done was now void, as no report had been made; and the committee was di&s;&s;olved. The hou&s;e, however, revived it, and appointed a day for its &s;itting; but, before it could re&s;ume its delibe|rations, admiral Ru&s;&s;el moved for its being adjourned, and all its purpo&s;es were defeated.</P>

<P>The court agents had by this time interpo&s;ed, and &s;ecured a ma|jority by the infamous arts of corruption. The commons no longer in&s;i&s;ted upon their points of advice. Their whole attention was now centered in the article of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They granted about two millions for the maintenance of three and thirty thou&s;and &s;eamen, the building of &s;ome additional &s;hips of war, and the fini&s;hing of Plymouth-dock; and &s;even hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds to &s;upply the deficiency of the quarterly poll. The e&s;timates of the land-&s;ervice were not di&s;cu&s;&s;ed without tedious debates, and warm di&s;putes. The mini&s;try demanded fifty-four thou&s;and men, twenty thou&s;and of whom &s;hould be kept at home for the defence of the nation, while the re&s;t &s;hould &s;erve abroad in the allied army. Many members declared their aver&s;ion to a foreign war, in which the nation had no immediate concern, and &s;o little pro&s;|pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Others agreed that the allies &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted on the conti|nent with a proportion of Briti&s;h forces; but that the nation &s;hould act as auxiliary, not as a principal, and pay no more than what the people would chearfully contribute to the general expence. The&s;e reflections, however, pro|duced no other effect than that of prolonging the debate. Mini&s;terial influ|ence had &s;urmounted all oppo&s;ition. The hou&s;e voted the number of men demanded. Such was their &s;ervile complai&s;ance, that when they examined the treaties by which the Engli&s;h and Dutch contracted equally with the German princes, and found that, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e treaties, Britain bore two-thirds of the expence, they overlooked this flagrant in&s;tance of par|tiality, and enabled the king to pay the proportion. Nay, their maxims
<PB N="97" REF="1000">
were &s;o much altered, that, in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting their re&s;entment again&s;t fo|reign generals, they a&s;&s;ented to a motion that the prince of Wirtemberg, the major generals Tetteau and La Fore&s;t, who commanded the Dani&s;h troops in the pay of the &s;tates-general, &s;hould be indulged with &s;uch an addition to their appointments as would make up the difference between the pay of Eng|land and that of Holland. Finally, they voted above two millions for the &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of the land-forces, and for defraying extraordinary expences attending the war upon the continent, including &s;ub&s;idies to the electors of Saxony and Hanover.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e of lords, mean while, was not free from animo&s;ity and contention. The Marlborough faction exerted them&s;elves with great vivacity. They affirmed it was the province of their hou&s;e to advi&s;e the &s;overeign: like the commons, they in&s;i&s;ted upon the king's having a&s;ked their advice, becau&s;e he had mentioned that word in his &s;peech, though he never dreamed they would catch at it with &s;uch eagerne&s;s. They moved, that the ta&s;k of dige&s;ting the articles of advice, &s;hould be undertaken by a joint committee of both hou&s;es: but all the dependents of the court, including the whole bench of bi&s;hops, except Wat&s;on of St. David's, were mar&s;halled to oppo&s;e this mo|tion, which was rejected by a majority of twelve; and this victory was fol|lowed with a prote&s;t of the vanqui&s;hed. Notwith&s;tanding this defeat, they pro&s;ecuted their &s;cheme of giving advice; and, after much wrangling and de|clamation, the hou&s;e agreed in an addre&s;s or remon&s;trance, advi&s;ing and be|&s;eeching his maje&s;ty, That the commanding officer of the Briti&s;h forces &s;hould be an Engli&s;hman: That Engli&s;h officers might take rank of tho&s;e in the confe|derate armies, who did not belong to crowned heads: That the twenty thou&s;and men to be left for the defence of the kingdom, &s;hould be all Engli&s;h, and com|manded by an Engli&s;h general: That the practice of pre&s;&s;ing men for the fleet &s;hould be remedied; and &s;uch officers as were guilty of that practice &s;hould be ca|&s;hiered and puni&s;hed: And, la&s;tly, That no foreigners &s;hould &s;it at the board of ordnance. This addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the king, who received it coldly, and &s;aid he would take it into con&s;ideration.</P>

<P>Then the lords re&s;olved to inquire into the mi&s;carriage of the purpo&s;ed de&s;cent, and called for all the papers relating to that affair: but the aim of the majority was not &s;o much to rectify the errors of the government, as to &s;kreen Nottingham, and cen&s;ure Ru&s;&s;el. That nobleman produced his own book of entries, together with the whole corre&s;pondence between him and the ad|miral, whom he verbally charged with having contributed to the mi&s;carriage of the expedition. This affair was referred to a committee. Sir John A&s;hby was examined. The hou&s;e directed the earl to draw up the &s;ub&s;tance of his charge; and the&s;e papers were afterwards delivered to a committee of the commons, at a conference, by the lord pre&s;ident and the re&s;t of the com|mittee above. They were offered for the in&s;pection of the commons, as they concerned &s;ome members of that hou&s;e, by whom they might be informed more fully of the particulars they contained. At another conference, which the commons demanded, their committee declared, in the name of the hou&s;e, That they had read and well con&s;idered the papers which their lord&s;hips had &s;ent them, and which they now returned: That, finding Mr. Ru&s;&s;el one of their members, often mentioned in the $aid papers, they
<PB N="98" REF="1010">
had unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, That admiral Ru&s;&s;el, in his command of the fleets, during the la&s;t $ummer's expedition, had behaved with fidelity, courage, and conduct. The lords, irritated at this declaration, and di&s;appointed in their re&s;entment again&s;t Ru&s;&s;el, de&s;ired a free conference between the committees of both hou&s;es, in which the earl of Roche&s;ter told the commons, he was com|manded by the hou&s;e of lords to inform them, that their lord&s;hips looked upon the late vote and proceedings of the lower hou&s;e, in returning their papers, to be irregular and unparliamentary, as they had not communicated to their lord&s;hips the lights they had received, and the rea&s;ons upon which their vote was founded. A paper to the &s;ame purport was delivered to colonel Granville, who promi&s;ed to pre&s;ent it to the commons, and make a faithful re|port of what his lord&s;hip had &s;aid. Thus the conference ended, and the in|quiry was di&s;continued.</P>

<P>The lower hou&s;e &s;eemed to be as much exa&s;perated again&s;t the earl of Nottingham as the lords were incen&s;ed at Ru&s;&s;el. A motion was made, that his maje&s;ty &s;hould be advi&s;ed to appoint &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioners of the board of admiralty as were of known experience in maritime affairs. Although this was over-ruled, they voted an addre&s;s to the king, praying, that for the future, all orders for the management of the fleet, might pa&s;s through the hands of the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners; a prote&s;t by implication again&s;t the conduct of the &s;ecretary. The con&s;ideration of ways and means was the next object that engro$ied the attention of the lower hou&s;e. They re&s;olved that a rate of four &s;hillings in the pound, for one year, &s;hould be charged upon all lands, according to their yearly value; as al&s;o upon all per&s;onal e&s;tates, and upon all offices and employments of profit, other than military offices in the army or navy. The act founded on this re&s;olution impowered the king to borrow money on the credit of it, at &s;even per cent. They further enabled him to rai&s;e one million on the general credit of the exchequer, by granting annuities. They laid &s;everal new duties on a variety of imports. They renewed the la&s;t quarterly poll, providing, that in ca&s;e it did not produce three hundred thou&s;and pounds, the deficiencies might be made up by borrowing on the general credit of the exchequer. They continued the impo&s;itions on wine, vinegar, tobacco, and &s;ugar, for five years; and tho&s;e on Ea&s;t India goods for four years. They laid a new impo&s;ition of eight per cent on the capital &s;tock of the Ea&s;t India company, e&s;timated at &s;even hundred and forty-four thou&s;and pounds; of one per cent$ on the African; of five pounds on every &s;hare of the &s;tock be|longing to the Hud&s;on's bay company; and they impowered his maje&s;ty to borrow five hundred thou&s;and pounds on the&s;e funds, which were expre&s;sly e&s;tabli&s;hed for maintaining the war with vigour <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French king hearing how liberally William was &s;upplied, exclaimed with &s;ome emo|tion, "My little cou&s;in the prince of Orange is fixed in the &s;addle&mdash;but, no matter, the la&s;$ Louis d'or mu&s;t carry it."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The money-bills were retarded in the upper-hou&s;e, by the arts of Hal|lifax, Mulgrave, and other malecontents. They grafted a clau&s;e on the land-tax bill, importing, that the lords &s;hould tax them&s;elves. It was adopted by the majority, and the bill &s;ent with this amendment to the commons, by whom it was unanimou&s;ly rejected, as a flagrant attempt upon their privileges. They demanded a conference, in which they declared, that the clau&s;e in que&s;tion was
<PB N="99" REF="1020">
a notorious encroachment upon the right the commons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of regulating all matters relating to &s;upplies granted by parliament. When this report was debated in the hou&s;e of lords, the earl of Mulgrave di&s;played uncommon powers of eloquence and argument, in per&s;uading the hou&s;e, that by yielding to this claim of the commons, they would dive&s;t them&s;elves of their true great|ne&s;s, and nothing would remain but the name and &s;hadow of a peer, which was but a pageant. Notwith&s;tanding all his oratory, the lords relinqui&s;hed their clau&s;e, declaring, at the &s;ame time, that they had agreed to pa&s;s the bill without alteration, merely in regard to the pre&s;ent urgent &s;tate of affairs, as being otherwi&s;e of opinion, that they had a right to in&s;i&s;t upon their clau&s;e. A formal complaint being made in the hou&s;e of commons again&s;t the pamphlet intitled, King William and Queen Mary Conquerors, as containing a&s;&s;ertions of dangerous con&s;equence to their maje&s;ties, to the liberty of the &s;ubject, and the peace of the kingdom; the licen&s;er and prin$er were taken into cu&s;tody. The book being examined, they re&s;olved that it &s;hould be burned by the hands of the common hangman; and, that the king &s;hould be moved to di&s;mi&s;s the licen&s;er from his employment. The &s;ame &s;entence they pronounced upon a pa&s;toral letter of bi&s;hop Burnet, in which this notion of conque&s;t had been at fir&s;t a&s;&s;erted. The lords, in order to manife&s;t their &s;entiments on the &s;ame &s;ubject, re&s;olved, That &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion was highly injurious to their maje&s;ties, incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles on which the government was founded, and tending to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the rights of the people. Bohun the licen&s;er was brought to the bar of the hou&s;e, and di&s;charged upon his own petition, after having been reprimanded on his knees by the &s;peaker.</P>

<P>Several members having complained that their &s;ervants had been kidnapped, and &s;ent to &s;erve as &s;oldiers in Flanders, the hou&s;e appointed a committee to enquire into the abu&s;es committed by pre&s;s-ma&s;ters; and a &s;uitable remon&s;trance was pre&s;ented to the king, who expre&s;&s;ed his indignation at this practice, and a&s;&s;ured the hou&s;e that the delinquents &s;hould be brought to ex|emplary puni&s;hment. Under&s;tanding, however, in the &s;equel, that the methods taken by his maje&s;ty for preventing this abu&s;e had not proved effectual, they re&s;umed their inquiry, and proceeded with uncommon vigour on the informa|tion they received. A great number of per&s;ons who had been pre&s;&s;ed, were di&s;charged by order of the hou&s;e; and captain Winter, the chief undertaker for this method of recruiting the army, was carried by the &s;erjeant before the lord chief ju&s;tice, that he might be pro&s;ecuted according to law.</P>

<P>Before the heats occa&s;ioned by this unpopular expedient were al|layed, the di&s;content of the nation was further inflamed by complaints from Ireland, where lord Sidney was &s;aid to rule with de&s;potic authority. The&s;e complaints were exhibited by Sir Francis Brew&s;ter, Sir William Gore, Sir John Macgill, lieutenant Stafford, Mr. Stone, and Mr. Kerne. They were examined at the bar of the hou&s;e, and delivered an account of their grievances in writing. Both hou&s;es concurred in this inquiry, which being fini&s;hed, they &s;everally pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es to the king. The lords ob&s;erved, That there had been great abu&s;es in di&s;po&s;ing of the for&s;eited e&s;tates: That protections had been granted to the Iri&s;h not included in the articles of Limerick; &s;o that prote&s;tants were deprived of the benefit of the law again&s;t them: That the quarters of the army had not been payed according to the provi&s;ion made by
<PB N="100" REF="1030">
parliament: That a mayor had been impo&s;ed upon the city of Dublin for two years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, contrary to the antient privileges and charter: That &s;everal per&s;ons accu&s;ed of m$rder had been executed without proof; and one Sweet|man, the mo&s;t guilty, di&s;charged without pro&s;ecution. The commons &s;poke more freely in their addre&s;s; they roundly explained the abu&s;es and mi&s;manage|ment of that government, by expo&s;ing the prote&s;tant &s;ubjects to the free quarter and violence of a licentious army; by recruiting the troops with Iri&s;h papi&s;ts, who had been in open rebellion again&s;t his maje&s;ty; by granting pro|te$tions to Iri&s;h roman catholics, whereby the cour&s;e of the law was &s;topped; by rever&s;$ng outlawries for high trea&s;on, not comprehended in the articles of Limerick; by letting the forfeited e&s;tates at under value, to the prejudice of his maje&s;ty's revenue; by embezzling the &s;tores left in the towns and garri|&s;ons by the late king James, as well as the effects belonging to forfeited e&s;tates, which might have been employed for the better pre&s;ervation of the kingdom; and, finally, by making additions to the articles of Limerick, after the capitulation was &s;igned, and the place &s;urrendered. They mo&s;t humbly be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to redre&s;s the&s;e abu&s;es, which had greatly encouraged the papi&s;ts, and weakened the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Ireland. The king graciou&s;ly received both addre&s;&s;es, and promi&s;ed to pay a particular regard to all re|mon&s;trances that &s;hould come from either hou&s;e of parliament: but no ma|terial &s;tep was taken again&s;t the lords Sidney, Athlone, and Coning&s;by, who appeared to have engro&s;&s;ed great part of the forfeitures by grants from the crown; and even commi&s;&s;ioner Culliford, who had been guilty of the mo&s;t grievous acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, e&s;caped with impunity.</P>

<P>The old Whig principle was not yet wholly expelled from the lower-hou&s;e. The undue influence of the court was exerted in &s;uch an open &s;candalous manner, as gave offence to the majority of the commons. In the mid&s;t of all their conde&s;cen&s;ion, Sir Edward Hu&s;&s;ey, member for Lin|coln, brought in a bill touching free and impartial proceedings in parlia|ment. It was intended to di&s;able all members of parliament from enjoying places of tru&s;t and profit, and particularly levelled again&s;t the officers of the army and navy, who had in&s;inuated them&s;elves into the hou&s;e in &s;uch num|bers, that this was commonly called the officers parliament. The bill pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of commons, and was &s;ent up to the lords, by whom it was read a &s;econd time, and committed; but the mini&s;try employing their whole &s;trength again&s;t it, on the report it was thrown out by a majority of two voices. The earl of Mulgrave again di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his elocution, in a &s;peech that was held in great veneration by the people; and, among tho&s;e who entered a prote&s;t in the journals of the hou&s;e, when the majority rejected the bill, was prince George of Denmark, duke of Cumberland. The court had not re|collected them&s;elves from the con&s;ternation produced by &s;uch a vigorous op|po&s;ition, when the earl of Shrew&s;bury produced another bill for triennial par|liaments, providing that there &s;hould be an annual &s;e&s;&s;ion; that if, at the ex|piration of the three years, the crown &s;hould not order the writs to be i&s;&s;ued, the lord chancellor, or keeper, or commi&s;&s;ioner of the great &s;eal, &s;hould i&s;&s;ue them ex officio, and by authority of this act, under &s;evere penalties. The immediate object of this bill was the di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent parliament, which had already &s;at three &s;e&s;&s;ions, and began to be formidable to the people,
<PB N="101" REF="1040">
from its conce&s;&s;ions to the mini&s;try. The benefits that would accrue to the con&s;titution from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of triennial parliaments were very well un|der&s;tood, as the&s;e points had been frequently di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in former reigns. The courtiers now objected, that frequent elections would render the freeholders proud and in&s;olent, encourage faction among the electors, and intail a con|tinual expence upon the member, as he would find him&s;elf obliged, during the whole time of his &s;itting, to behave like a candidate, con&s;cious how &s;oon the time of election would revolve. In &s;pite of the mini&s;terial intere&s;t in the upper-hou&s;e, the bill pa&s;&s;ed, and contained a provi&s;o, that the pre&s;ent parlia|ment &s;hould not continue any longer than the month of January next en&s;uing. The court renewed its efforts again&s;t it in the hou&s;e of commons, where, neverthele&s;s, it was carried, with &s;ome little alterations, which the lords ap|proved. But all the&s;e endeavours were fru&s;trated by the prerogative of the king, who, by refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;ent, prevented its being enacted into a law.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XV.</HEAD>
<P>It was at the in&s;tigation of the mini&s;try, that the commons brought in a bill for continuing and explaining certain temporary laws then expiring or expired. Among the&s;e was an act for re&s;training the liberty of the pre&s;s, which owed its origin to the reign of Charles II. and had been revived in the fir&s;t year of the &s;ucceeding reign. The bill pa&s;&s;ed the lower hou&s;e without difficulty, but met with warm oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of lords, a good number of whom prote&s;ted again&s;t it, as a law that &s;ubjected all learning and true in|formation to the arbitrary will of a mercenary, and perhaps ignorant licen&s;er, de&s;troyed the properties of authors, and extended the evil of monopolies. The bill for regulating trials was dropped, and, in lieu of it, another pro|duced for the pre&s;ervation of their maje&s;ties &s;acred per&s;ons and government; but this too was rejected by the majority, in con&s;equence of the mini&s;try's &s;e|cret management. The Ea&s;t India company narrowly e&s;caped di&s;&s;olution. Petitions and counter-petitions were delivered into the hou&s;e of commons: the preten&s;ions on both &s;ides were carefully examined: a committee of the whole hou&s;e re&s;olved, that there &s;hould be a new &s;ub&s;cription of a joint-&s;tock, not exceeding two millions five hundred thou&s;and pounds, to continue for one and twenty years. The report was made and received, and the public expected to &s;ee the affair brought to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue: but the company had re|cour&s;e to the &s;ame expedients, which had lately proved &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the hands of the mini&s;try. Tho&s;e who had been the mo&s;t warm in detecting their abu&s;es, &s;uddenly cooled; and the pro&s;ecution of the affair began to langui&s;h. Not but that the hou&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, praying that he would di&s;&s;olve the company upon three years warning, according to the con|dition of their charter. He told them he would con&s;ider their addre&s;s; and they did not further urge their remon&s;trance. The bill for a&s;certaining the commi&s;&s;ions and &s;alaries of the judges, to which the king had refu&s;ed the royal a&s;&s;ent in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, was revived, twice read, and rejected; and another, for preventing the exportation and melting of the coin, they &s;uffered to lie neglected on the table. On the fourteenth day of March, the king put an end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion, after having thanked the parliament for &s;o great te&s;timo|nies of their affection, and promi&s;ed the &s;upplies &s;hould not be mi&s;applied. He ob&s;erved, that the po&s;ture of affairs called him abroad; but that he would leave a &s;ufficient number of troops for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom: he a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="102" REF="1050">

<P>During the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, lord Mohun was indicted and tried by his peers, in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, as an accomplice in the murder of one Mont|ford, a celebrated comedian, the marquis of Carmarthen acting as lord-&s;teward upon this occa&s;ion. The judges having been con&s;ulted, the peers proceeded to give their judgments &s;eriatim, and Mohun was acquitted by a great majority. The king, who, from his fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, had endeavoured to trim the balance between the Whigs and Tories, by mingling them together in his mini&s;try, made &s;ome alterations at this period, that &s;avoured of the &s;ame po|licy. The great-&s;eal, with the title of lord-keeper, was be&s;towed upon Sir John Somers, who was well &s;killed in the law, as in many other branches of polite and u&s;eful literature. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a remarkable talent for bu&s;ine&s;s, in which he exerted great patience and a&s;&s;iduity; was gentle, candid, and equi|table; a Whig in principles, yet moderate, pacific, and conciliating. Of the &s;ame temper was Sir John Trenchard, now appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate. He had been concerned with the duke of Monmouth, and e&s;caped to the continent, where he lived &s;ome years; was calm, &s;edate, well acquainted with foreign af|fairs, and con&s;idered as a leading man in his party. The&s;e two are &s;aid to have been promoted at the recommendation of the earl of Sunderland, who had by this time in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the king's favour and confidence; though his &s;ucce&s;s confirmed the opinion which many entertained, of his having betrayed his old ma&s;ter. The leaders of the oppo&s;ition, were Sir Edward Seymour, again become a malcontent, and Sir Chri&s;topher Mu&s;grave, a gentleman of Cumber|land, who, though an extravagant Tory from principle, had refu&s;ed to concur with all the de&s;igns of the late king. He was a per&s;on of a grave and regular deportment, who had rejected many offers of the mini&s;try, which he oppo&s;ed with great violence; yet on &s;ome critical occa&s;ions, his patrioti&s;m gave way to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barnet Hut. of K. W. Barchet. Lives of the $span$ Ralph. $word$ Stare Tracts.</NOTE> his avarice, and he yielded up &s;ome important points, in con&s;ideration of large &s;ums which he received from the court in &s;ecret. Others declared war again&s;t the admini&s;tration, becau&s;e they thought their own talents were not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered. Of the&s;e, the chiefs were Paul Foley and Robert Harley. The fir&s;t was a lawyer of good capacity, exten&s;ive learning, and virtuous principles; but peevi&s;h, ob&s;tinate, and moro&s;e. He entertained a very de&s;picable opinion of the court; and this he propagated with equal a&s;&s;iduity and &s;ucce&s;s. Harley po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good fund of learning; was capable of uncommon application, par|ticularly turned to politics. He knew the forms of parliament, had a peculiar dexterity at protracting and perplexing debates; and cheri&s;hed the mo&s;t a&s;piring

ambition. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el was created trea&s;urer of the hou&s;hold; but the com|mand of the fleet was ve&s;ted in the hands of Killigrew, Delaval, and Shovel.

The troops of the confede|rates were forthwith ordered to a&s;&s;emble; but while he was employed in making preparations for the campaign, the French king actually took the field, attended by madame de Maintenon, and all the court ladies. His de&s;ign was &s;uppo&s;ed to be upon &s;ome town in Brabant: his army amounted to one hundred and twenty thou&s;and men, completely armed, and abundantly &s;upplied with all ne|ce&s;&s;aries for every &s;ort of military operation. King William immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong camp at Parke near Louvain, a &s;ituation which enabled him to cover the places that were mo&s;t expo&s;ed. Under&s;tanding that the French emi&s;&s;aries had &s;own the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the bi&s;hop and chapter of Liege, he &s;ent the duke of Wirtemberg thither, to reconcile the different par|ties, and concert mea&s;ures for the further &s;ecurity of the place. He reinforced the garri&s;on with nine battalions; and the elector palatine lay with his troops in readine&s;s to march to its relief.

Immediately after his departure, Luxembourg fixed his head-quarters at Mil|dert; and king William &s;trengthened his camp on that &s;ide with ten battalions, and eight and twenty pieces of cannon. The enemy's convoys were frequently &s;urpri&s;ed by detachments from the garri&s;on of Charleroy; and a large body of hor&s;e, foot, and dragoons, being draughted out of Liege and Mae&s;tricht, took po&s;t at Huy, under the command of the count de Tilly, &s;o as to &s;traiten the French in their quarters. The&s;e, however, were di&s;lodged by Luxembourg in per&s;on, who obliged the count to pa&s;s the Jaar with precipitation, leaving behind three &s;quadrons and all his baggage, which fell into the hands of the enemy. This check, however, was ballanced by the &s;ucce&s;s of the duke of Wirtemberg, who, at the head of thirteen battalions of infantry, and twenty &s;quadrons of hor&s;e, forced the French lines between the Schelde and the Lys; and layed the whole country as far as Li&s;le under contribution. On that very day, which was the eighteenth of July, Luxembourg marched towards Huy, which was next morning inve&s;ted by M. de Villeroy. The other covered the &s;iege, and &s;ecured him&s;elf from the allies by lines of contravallation. Before their batteries began to play, the town capitulated. On the twenty-third day of the month, the garri&s;on mutinied; the ca&s;tles were &s;urrendered; the governor

remained a pri&s;oner; and his men were conducted to Liege. The confede|rate army advanced in order to relieve the town; but the king being apprized of its fate, detached ten battalions to reinforce the garri&s;on of Liege, and next day returned to Neer-He&s;pen.</P>

<P>Luxembourg made a motion towards Liege, as if he had in|tended to be&s;iege the place; and encamped at Hellecheim, about &s;even leagues from the confederates. Knowing how much they were weakened by the different detachments which had been made from their army, he re&s;olved to attack them in their camp, or at lea&s;t fall upon their rear, &s;hould they retreat at his approach. On the twenty-eight day of July, he began his march in four columns, and pa&s;&s;ed the Jaar near its &s;ource, with an army &s;uperior to the allies by five and thirty thou&s;and men. The king of England, at fir&s;t, looked upon this motion as a feint to cover the de&s;ign upon Liege; but receiving intelligence that their whole army was in full march to attack him in his camp, he re&s;olved to keep his ground; and immediately drew up his forces in order of battle. His general-officers advi&s;ed him to repa&s;s the Geet; but he cho&s;e to ri&s;que a battle, rather than expo&s;e the rear of his army in repa&s;&s;ing that river. His right wing extended as far as Neer-Winden, along the Geet, covered with hedges, hollow-ways, and a &s;mall rivulet: the left reached to Neer-Landen; and the&s;e two villages were joined by a &s;light intrenchment, which the king or|dered to be thrown up in the evening. Brigadier Ram&s;ey, with the regiments of Ofarrel, Mackay, Lauder, Leven, and Monroe, were ordered to the right of the whole army, to line &s;ome hedges and hollow-ways, on the farther &s;ide of the village of Lare. Six battalions of Brandenburgh were po&s;ted to the left of this village; and general Dumont with the Hanoverian infantry, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the vil|lage of Neer-Winden, which covered part of the camp, between the main body and the right wing of the cavalry. Neer-Landen on the left, was &s;ecured by &s;ix battalions of Engli&s;h, Danes, and Dutch. The remaining infantry was drawn up in one line behind the intrenchment. The dragoons upon the left guarded the village of Dormal upon the brook of Beck; and from thence the left wing of hor&s;e extended to Neer-Landen, where it was covered by this rivulet.</P>
</DIV4>

<HEAD>&sect; XX.</HEAD>
<P>The king having vi&s;ited all the po&s;ts on hor&s;eback, and given the nece&s;&s;ary orders, repo&s;ed him&s;elf about two hours in his coach; and early in the morning &s;ent for his chaplain, whom he joined in prayer with great devo|tion. At &s;un-ri&s;ing the enemy appeared drawn up in order of battle; and the allies began to play their cannon with good &s;ucce&s;s. About eight in the morn|ing they attacked the villages of Lare and Neer-Winden with great fury; and twice made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the&s;e po&s;ts, from whence they were as often repul&s;ed. At length, the allies kept their ground; and, the duke of Berwick was taken by his uncle brigadier Churchill. Then the French made an attack upon the left wing of the confederates at Neer-Landen; and after a very ob|&s;tinate di&s;pute, were obliged to give way, though they &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the avenues. The prince of Conti, however, renewed the charge with the flower of the French infantry; and the confederates being overpowered, retreated from the village, leaving the camp in that part expo&s;ed. Villeroy marching this way with a body of hor&s;e, was encountered and repul&s;ed by the count D'Arco, ge|neral of the Bavarian cuira&s;&s;iers; and the duke de Chartres narrowly e&s;caped being taken. Mean while, Luxembourg, the prince of Conti, the count de Mar&s;in,
<PB N="105" REF="1080">
and the marechal de Joyeu&s;e, charged on the right, and in different parts of the line, with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity as &s;urmounted all re&s;i&s;tance. The camp of the confederates was immediately filled with French troops: the villages of Lare and Neer-Winden were taken, after a long and de&s;perate di&s;pute. The Hano|verian and Dutch hor&s;e being broken, the king in per&s;on brought the Engli&s;h cavalry to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They fought with great gallantry; and for &s;ome time retarded the fate of the day. The infantry was rallied, and &s;tood firm until all their ammunition was expended. In a word, they were &s;carce able to &s;u&s;tain the weight of &s;uch a &s;uperiority in point of number, when the marquis D'Harcourt joined the enemy from Huy, with two and twenty fre&s;h &s;quadrons, which immediately turned the &s;cale in their favour. The elector of Bavaria, after having made extraordinary efforts, retreated with great difficulty over the bridge to the other &s;ide of the river, where he rallied the troops, in order to favour the retreat of tho&s;e who had not pa&s;&s;ed. The king &s;eeing the battle lo&s;t, and the whole army in confu&s;ion, retired with the infantry to Dormal on the brook of Beck, where the dragoons of the left wing were po&s;ted. Then he ordered the regiments of Wyndham, Lumley, and Galway, to cover his retreat over the bridge at Neer-He&s;pen, which he effected with great difficulty. Now all was tumult, rout, and con&s;ternation; and a great number of the fugitives threw them&s;elves into the river, where they were drowned. This had like to have been the fate of the brave earl of Athlone; the duke of Ormond was wounded in &s;everal places, and taken pri&s;oner by the enemy; and the count de Solmes was mortally wounded. Talma&s;h brought off the greater part of the Engli&s;h infantry with great gallantry and conduct: as for the baggage, it had been &s;ent to Liege before the engagement: but, the confederates lo&s;t &s;ixty pieces of cannon, and nine mortars, a great number of &s;tandards and colours <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The duke of Luxembourg &s;ent &s;uch a num|ber of &s;tandards and en&s;igns to Paris, during the cour&s;e of this war, that the prince of Conti called him the Uphol&s;terer of Notre-Dame, a church in which tho&s;e trophies were di&s;played.</NOTE>, with about &s;even thou&s;and men killed and wounded in the action. It mu&s;t be owned that the allies fought with great valour and per&s;everance; and that king William made prodigious efforts of courage and activity to retrieve the fortune of the day. He was pre&s;ent in all parts of the battle; he charged in per&s;on both on hor&s;eback and a-foot, where the danger was mo&s;t imminent. His p$ruke, the &s;leeve of his coat, and the knot of his &s;carf were penetrated by three different mu&s;ket-bullets; and he &s;aw a great number of &s;oldiers fall on every &s;ide of him. The enemy bore witne&s;s to his extraordinary valour. The prince of Conti, in a letter to his prince&s;s, which was intercepted, declared, that he &s;aw the prince of Orange expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the greate&s;t dangers; and that &s;uch val$ur richly de&s;erved the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown he wore. Yet here, as in every other battle he fought, his conduct and di&s;po&s;ition were &s;everely cen|&s;ured. Luxembourg having ob&s;erved the nature of his &s;ituation immediately before the engagement, is &s;aid to have exclaimed, <Q>&startq;Now I believe Waldeck is really dead;&endq;</Q> alluding to that general's known &s;agacity in choo&s;ing ground for an encampment. Be that as it will, he payed dear for his victory. His lo&s;s in officers and men exceeded that of the allies; and he reaped no &s;olid ad|vantage from the battle. He remained fifteen days inactive at Waren, while king William recalling the duke of Wirtemberg, and draughting troops from Liege and other garri&s;ons, was in a few days able to hazard another engagement.</P>

<P>Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of the campaign, until Luxembourg being rejoined by Boufflers with a &s;trong rein|forcement from the Rhine, inve&s;ted Charleroy. He had taken his mea&s;ures with &s;uch caution and dexterity, that the allies could not fru&s;trate his opera|tions, without attacking his lines at a great di&s;advantage. The king detached the elector of Bavaria and the duke of Wirtemberg, with thirty battalions and forty &s;quadrons, to make a diver&s;ion in Flanders; but, they returned in a few days, without having attempted any thing of con&s;equence. The garri&s;on of Charleroy defended the place with &s;urpri&s;ing valour, from the tenth of Sep|tember to the eleventh of October, during which period they had repul&s;ed the a&s;&s;ailants in &s;everal attacks: but, at length, de&s;pairing of relief, the governor capitulated on the mo&s;t honourable conditions; and the reduction of the place was celebrated with a Te Deum, and other rejoicings at Paris. Lewis, however, in the mid&s;t of all his glory, was extremely mortified when he reflected upon the little advantage he had reaped from all his late victories. The allies had been defeated &s;ucce&s;&s;ively at Fleurus, Steenkirk, and Landen; but in a fortnight after each of tho&s;e battles, William was always in a condition to ri&s;que another engagement. Formerly Lewis had conquered half of Holland, Flanders, and Franche-Comte, without a battle; whereas now he could not with his utmo&s;t efforts, and after the mo&s;t &s;ignal victories, pa&s;s the frontiers of the United-Pro|vinces. The conque&s;t of Charleroy concluded the campaign in the Nether|lands; and both armies went into winter-quarters.</P>

<P>The French army on the Rhine, under De Lorges, pa&s;&s;ed that river in the month of May, at Philip&s;burg, and inve&s;ted the city of Heidelberg which they took, plundered, and reduced to a&s;hes. This general committed number|le&s;s barbarities in the Palatinate, which he ravaged without even &s;paring the tombs of the dead. The French &s;oldiers, on this occa&s;ion, &s;eem to have been actuated by the mo&s;t brutal inhumanity. They butchered the inhabitants, vio|lated the women, plundered the hou&s;es, rifled the churches, and murdered prie&s;ts at the altar. They broke open the electoral vault, and &s;cattered the a&s;hes of that illu&s;trious family about the &s;treets. They &s;et fire to different quarters of the city; they &s;tripped about fifteen thou&s;and of the inhabitants, without di&s;|tinction of age or &s;ex, and drove them naked into the ca&s;tle, that the garri&s;on might be the &s;ooner induced to capitulate. There they remained like cattle in the open air, without food or covering, tortured between the horrors of their fate and the terrors of a bombardment. When they were &s;et at liberty, in con&s;equence of the fort's being &s;urrendered, a great number of them died along the banks of the Neckar, from cold, hunger, angui&s;h, and de&s;pair. The&s;e enormous cruelties, which would have di&s;graced the arms of a Tartarian free|booter, were acted by the expre&s;s command of Lewis XIV. of France, who has been celebrated by &s;o many venal pens, not only as the greate&s;t monarch, but al&s;o as the mo&s;t poli&s;hed prince of Chri&s;tendom. De Lorges advanced to|wards the Neckar again&s;t the prince of Baden, who lay encamped on the other &s;ide of that river: but in attempting to pa&s;s, he was twice repul&s;ed with con|&s;iderable damage. The dauphin joining the army, which now amounted to &s;eventy thou&s;and men, cro&s;&s;ed without oppo&s;ition; but, found the Germans &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, that he would not hazard an attack: having therefore repa&s;&s;ed the river, he &s;ecured Stutgard with a garri&s;on, &s;ent detachments into
<PB N="107" REF="1100">
Flanders and Piedmont, and returned in Augu&s;t to Ver&s;ailles. In Piedmont the allies were &s;till more unfortunate. The duke of Savoy and his confederates &s;eemed bent upon driving the French from Ca&s;al and Pignerol. The fir&s;t of the&s;e places was blocked up, and the other actually inve&s;ted. The fort of St. Bridget that covered the place, was taken, and the town bombarded. Mean while Cati|nat being reinforced, de&s;cended into the plains. The duke was &s;o apprehen|&s;ive of Turin, that he abandoned the &s;iege of Pignerol, after having blown up the fort, and marched in que&s;t of the enemy to the plain of Mar&s;aglia, in the neighbourhood of his capital. On the fourth day of October, the French advanced upon them from the hills, between Orba&s;&s;on and Pro&s;a&s;que; and a de&s;perate engagement en&s;ued. The enemy charged the left wing of the confederates &s;word in hand, with incredible fury; and though they were once repul&s;ed, they renewed the attack with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the Neapolitan and Milane&s;e hor&s;e were obliged to give way, and di&s;or|dered the German cavalry. The&s;e falling upon the foot, threw the whole wing into confu&s;ion. Mean while, the main body and the other wing &s;u&s;tained the charge without flinching, until they were expo&s;ed in flank by the defeat of the cavalry: then the whole front gave way. In vain the &s;econd line was brought up to &s;u&s;tain them: the hor&s;e turned their backs, and the infantry was totally routed. In a word, the confederates were obliged to retire with preci|pitation, leaving their cannon, and about eight thou&s;and men killed or wounded on the field of battle. The duke of Schomberg having been denied the po&s;t which was his due, in&s;i&s;ted upon fighting at the head of the troops maintained by the king of Great Britain, who were po&s;ted in the center; and behaved with great gallantry under the eye of their commander. When the left wing was defeated, the count de los Torres de&s;ired he would take upon him the command, and retreat with the infantry and right wing; but, he refu&s;ed to act without the order of his highne&s;s, and &s;aid, things were come to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that they mu&s;t either conquer or die. He continued to animate his men with his voice and ex|ample, until he received a &s;hot in the thigh. His valet &s;eeing him fall, ran to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and called for quarter; but was killed by the enemy before he could be under&s;tood. The duke being taken at the &s;ame in&s;tant, was afterwards di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed upon his parole; and in a few days died at Turin, univer&s;ally lamented on account of his great and amiable qualities. The earl of Warwick and Hol|land, who accompanied him as a volunteer, &s;hared his fate in being wounded and taken pri&s;oner; but, he &s;oon recovered his health and liberty. This victory as as un&s;ub&s;tantial as that of Landen, and almo&s;t as dear in the purcha&s;e; for the confederates made an ob&s;tinate defence, and yielded &s;olely to &s;uperior num|ber. The duke of Savoy retreated to Moncalier, and threw a reinforcement into Coni, which Catinat would not venture to be&s;iege; &s;o &s;everely had he been handled in the battle. He therefore contented him&s;elf with laying the country under contribution, reinforcing the garri&s;ons of Ca&s;al, Pignerol, and Su&s;a; and making preparations for repa&s;&s;ing the mountains. The news of the victory no &s;ooner reached Paris, than Lewis di&s;patched Mr. de Chanlais to Turin, with propo&s;als for detaching the duke of Savoy from the intere&s;t of the allies; and the pope, who was now become a parti&s;an of France, &s;upported the negotiation with his whole influence: but the French king had not yet touched upon the right &s;tring. The duke continued deaf to all his addre&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>France had been alike &s;ucce&s;sful in her intrigues at the courts of Rome and Con&s;tantinople. The vizir at the Porte had been converted into a pen&s;ionary and creature of Lewis; but, the war in which the Turks had been &s;o long and un&s;ucce&s;sfully engaged, rendered him &s;o odious to the people, that the grand &s;ignor depo&s;ed him, in order to appea&s;e their clamours. The Engli&s;h and Dutch amba&s;&s;adors at Con&s;tantinople forthwith renewed their mediation for a peace with the emperor; but the terms they propo&s;ed were &s;till rejected with di&s;dain. In the mean time, general Heu&s;ler, who commanded the Imperiali&s;ts in Tran&s;ylvania, reduced the fortre&s;&s;es of Jeno and Villagu&s;war. In the beginning of July, the duke de Croy a&s;&s;umed the chief command of the German army, pa&s;&s;ed the Danube and the Saave, and inve&s;ted Belgrade. The &s;iege was car|ried on for &s;ome time with great vigour; but, at length abandoned at the approach of the vizir, who obliged the Imperiali&s;ts to repa&s;s the Saave, and &s;ent out parties which made incur&s;ions into Upper-Hungary. The power of France had never been &s;o con&s;picuous as at this juncture, when &s;he maintained a for|midable navy at &s;ea, and four great armies in different parts of Europe. Exclu|&s;ive of the operations in Flanders, Germany, and Piedmont, the count de Noailles inve&s;ted Ro&s;es in Catalonia, about the latter end of May, while at the &s;ame time it was blocked up by the French fleet, under the command of the count D'E$rees. In a few days the place was &s;urrendered by capitulation; and the ca&s;tle of Ampurias met with the &s;ame fate. The Spani&s;h power was reduced to &s;uch a degree, that No$illes might have proceeded in his conque&s;ts without interruption, had not he been obliged to detach part of his army to reinforce Catinat in Piedmont.</P>

<P>Nothing could be more inglorious for the Engli&s;h than their opera|tions by &s;ea in the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer. The king had ordered the admirals to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch in equipping the fleets, that they might block up the enemy in their own ports, and protect the commerce, which had &s;uffered &s;everely from the French privateers. They were, however, &s;o dilatory in their proceed|ings, that the &s;quadrons of the enemy &s;ailed from their harbours before the Engli&s;h fleet could put to &s;ea. About the middle of May it was a&s;&s;embled at St. Helen's, and took on board five regiments, intended for a de&s;cent on Bre&s;t; but this enterprize was never attempted. When the Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;qua|drons joined, &s;o as to form a very numerous fleet, the public expected they would undertake &s;ome expedition of importance; but the admirals were divided in opinion, nor did their orders warrant their executing any &s;cheme of con&s;equence. Killigrew and Delaval did not e&s;cape the &s;u&s;picion of being di&s;affected to the &s;ervice; and France was &s;aid to have maintained a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the malcontents in England. Lewis had made &s;urpri&s;ing efforts to repair the damage which his navy had &s;u&s;tained. He had purcha&s;ed &s;everal large ve&s;&s;els, and converted them into &s;hips of war; he had layed an embargo on all the &s;hipping of his kingdom, until his &s;quadrons were manned: he had made a grand naval promotion, to encourage the officers and &s;eamen; and this expedient produced a wonderful &s;pirit of activity and emulation. In the month of May his fleet &s;ailed to the Mediterranean, in three &s;quadrons, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventy-one capital &s;hips, be&s;ides bomb-ketches, fire&s;hips, and tenders.</P>

<P>In the beginning of June, the Engli&s;h and Dutch fleets &s;ailed down the channel. On the &s;ixth, Sir George Rooke was detached to the Streights,
<PB N="109" REF="1120">
with a &s;quadron of three and twenty &s;hips, as convoy to the Mediterranean trade. The great fleet returned to Torbay, while he pur&s;ued his voyage, hav|ing under his protection about four hundred merchants &s;hips belonging to Eng|land, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Hamburgh, and Flanders. On the &s;ix|teenth, his &s;couts di&s;covered part of the French fleet under Cape St. Vincent: next day their whole navy appeared to the amount of eighty &s;ail. Sixteen of the&s;e plied up to the Engli&s;h &s;quadron, while the vice-admiral of the white &s;tood off to &s;ea, to intercept the &s;hips under convoy. Sir George Rooke, by the advice of the Dutch vice-admiral Vaudergoes, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to avoid an engagement, which could only tend to their ab&s;olute ruin. He forthwith &s;ent orders to the &s;mall &s;hips that were near the land, to put into the neighbour|ing ports of Faro, St. Lucar, and Cadiz, while he him&s;elf &s;tood off with an ea&s;y &s;ail for the protection of the re&s;t. About &s;ix in the evening, ten &s;ail of the enemy came up with two Dutch &s;hips of war, commanded by the captains Schrijver and Vander-Poel, who &s;eeing no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping, tacked in &s;hore; and thus drawing the French after them, helped to &s;ave the re&s;t of the fleet. When attacked they made a mo&s;t de&s;perate defence; but at la&s;t were overpowered by numbers, and taken. An Engli&s;h &s;hip of war, and a rich pin|nace were burned, nine and twenty merchant-ve&s;&s;els were taken, and about fifty de&s;troyed by the counts de Tourville and D'E&s;trees. Seven of the large&s;t Smyrna &s;hips fell into the hands of M. de Coetlogon, and four he &s;unk in the bay of Gibraltar. The value of the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained on this occa&s;ion, amounted to one million &s;terling. Mean while Rooke &s;tood off with a fre&s;h gale, and on the nineteenth &s;ent home the Lark &s;hip of war, with the news of his misfor|tune; then he bore away for the Maderas, where having taken in wood and water, he &s;et &s;ail for Ireland; and on the third day of Augu&s;t arrived at Cork, with fifty &s;ail, including &s;hips of war and trading ve&s;&s;els. He detached captain Fairborne to Kin&s;ale, with all his &s;quadron, except &s;ix &s;hips of the line, with which, in pur&s;uance of orders, he joined the great fleet then cruizing in the chops of the channel. On the twenty-fifth day of Augu&s;t, they returned to St. Helen's, and the four regiments were landed. On the nineteenth day of September, fifteen Dutch &s;hips of the line, and two frigates, &s;et &s;ail for Holland; and twenty-&s;ix &s;ail, with &s;even fire&s;hips, were a&s;&s;igned as guard-&s;hips during the winter.</P>

<P>The French admirals, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing Rooke to Madera, made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon Cadiz, and bombarded Gibraltar, where the merchants &s;unk their &s;hips, that they might not fall into the hands of the enemy. Then they &s;ailed along the coa&s;t of Spain, de&s;troyed &s;ome Engli&s;h and Dutch ve&s;&s;els at Malaga, Alicant, and other places; and returned in triumph to Toulon. About this period, Sir Francis Wheeler returned to England with his &s;quadron, from an unfortunate expedition in the We&s;t-Indies. In conjunc|tion with colonel Codrington, governor of the Leeward i&s;lands, he made un|&s;ucce&s;sful attempts upon the i&s;lands of Martinique and Dominque. Then he &s;ailed to Bo&s;ton in New-England, with a view to concert an expedition again&s;t Quebec, which was judged impracticable. He afterwards &s;teered for Placentia in Newfoundland, which he would have attacked without he&s;itation; but the de&s;ign was rejected by a majority of voices in the council of war. Thus di&s;ap|pointed he &s;et &s;ail for England; and arrived at Port&s;mouth in a very &s;hattered

<P>In November another effort was made to annoy the enemy. Com|modore Benbow &s;ailed with a &s;quadron of twelve capital &s;hips, four bomb-ketches, and ten brigantines, to the coa&s;t of St. Malo, and anchoring within half a mile of the town, c$nnonaded and bombarded it for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. Then they landed on an i&s;land, where they burned a convent. On the nineteenth, they took the advantage of a dark night, a fre&s;h gale, and a &s;trong tide, to &s;end in a fire&s;hip of a particular contrivance, &s;tiled the Infernal, in order to burn the town; but, &s;he &s;truck upon a rock before &s;he arrived at the place, and the engineer was obliged to &s;et her on fire, and retreat. She continued burning for &s;ome time, and at la&s;t blew up, with &s;uch an explo&s;ion as &s;hook the whole town like an earthquake, unroofed three hundred hou&s;es, and broke all the gla&s;s and earthen ware for three leagues around. A cap$tan that weighed two hundred pounds was tran&s;ported into the place, and falling upon a hou&s;e, levelled it to the ground; the greate&s;t part of the wall towards the &s;ea tumbled down; and the inhabitants were overwhelmed wit$ con&s;ternation: &s;o that a &s;mall number of troops might have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without re&s;i&s;tance; but there was not a &s;ol|dier on board. Neverthele&s;s, the &s;ailors took and demoli&s;hed Quince-fort, and did con&s;iderable damage to the town of St. Malo, which had been a ne&s;t of pri|vateers that infe&s;ted the Engli&s;h commerce. Though this attempt was executed with great &s;pirit, and &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, the clamours of the people became louder and louder. They &s;crupled not to &s;ay, that the councils of the nation were be|trayed; and their &s;u&s;picions ro$e even to the &s;ecretary's office. They ob&s;erved, that the French were previou&s;ly acquainted with all the motions of the Eng|li&s;h, and took their mea&s;ures accordingly for their de&s;truction. They collected and compared a good number of particulars, that &s;eemed to ju&s;tify their &s;u&s;picion of treachery. But the misfortunes of the nation, in all probability, aro&s;e from a motley mini&s;try, divided among them&s;elves, who in&s;tead of acting in concert for the public good, employed all their influence to thwart the views, and blacken the reputations of each other. The people in general exclaimed again&s;t the marquis of Caermarthen, the earls of Nottingham and Roche&s;ter, who had ac|quired great credit with the queen; and, from their hatred to the Whigs, be|trayed the intere&s;ts of the nation.</P>

<P>But if the Engli&s;h were di&s;contented, the French were mi&s;erable, in &s;pite of all their victories. That kingdom laboured under a dreadful famine, occa&s;ioned partly from unfavourable &s;ea&s;ons, and partly from the war, which had not left hands &s;uff$cient to cultivate the ground. Notwith&s;tanding all the diligence and pr$vidence of their mini&s;try, in bringing &s;upplies of corn from Sweden and Denmark, their care in regulating the price, and furni&s;hing the markets, their liberal contributions for the relief of the indige$t; multitudes peri&s;hed of want, and the whole kingdom was reduced to poverty and di&s;tre&s;s. Lewis p$ned in the mid&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;s. He &s;aw his &s;ubjects exhau&s;ted by a ruinous war, in which they had been involved by his ambition. He tampered with the allies apart, in hope of dividing and detaching them from the grand con|federacy he &s;ollicited the northern crowns to engage as mediators for a general peace. A memorial was actually pre&s;ented by the Dani&s;h mini&s;ter to king Wil|liam, by which it appears, that the French king would have been contented to
<PB N="111" REF="1140">
purcha&s;e a peace with &s;ome con&s;iderable conce&s;&s;ions. But the terms were re|jected by the king of England, who&s;e ambition and revenge were not yet grati|fied; and who&s;e &s;ubjects, though heavy laden, could &s;till bear additional burthens.</P>

<P>The Jacobites had been very attentive to the progre&s;s of di&s;&s;atisfac|tion in England, which they fomented with their u&s;ual a&s;&s;iduity. The late decla|ration of king James had been couched in &s;uch imperious terms as gave offence even to &s;ome of tho&s;e who favoured his intere&s;t. The earl of Middleton there|fore, in the beginning of the year repaired to St. Germain's, and obtained another, which contained the promi&s;e of a general pardon without exceptions; and every other conce&s;&s;ion that a Briti&s;h &s;ubject could demand of his &s;overeign. About the latter end of May, two men, named Canning and Dormer, were apprehended for di&s;per&s;ing copies of this paper, tried at the Old Bailey, found guilty of not only di&s;per&s;ing, but al&s;o of compo&s;ing a fal&s;e and &s;editious libel, &s;entenced to pay five hundred marks a-piece, to &s;tand three times in the pillory, and find &s;ureties for their good behaviour. But, no circum&s;tance reflected more di&s;grace on this reign, than the fate of Anderton, the &s;uppo&s;ed printer of &s;ome tracts again&s;t the government. He was brought to trial for high-trea&s;on: he made a vigorous defence, in &s;pite of the in&s;ults and di&s;couragements he &s;u&s;tained from a partial bench. As nothing but pre&s;umptions appeared again&s;t him, the jury &s;crupled to bring in a verdict that would affect his life, until they were reviled and reprimanded by judge Treby; then they found him guilty. In vain re|cour&s;e was had to the queen's mercy: he &s;uffered death at Tyburn; and left a paper, prote&s;ting &s;olemnly again&s;t the proceedings of the court, which he af|firmed, was appointed, not to try, but to convict him; and petitioning heaven to forgive his penitent jury. The &s;everity of the government was likewi&s;e ex|emplified in the ca&s;e of &s;ome adventurers, who having equipped privateers to cruize upon the Engli&s;h, under joint-commi&s;&s;ions from the late king James and Lewis XIV. happened to be taken by the Engli&s;h &s;hips of war. Dr. Oldys, the king's advocate, being commanded to proceed again&s;t them as guilty of trea&s;on and pyracy, refu&s;ed to commence the pro&s;ecution; and gave his opinion in writ|ing, that they were neither traitors nor pyrates. He &s;upported this opinion by arguments before the council, and was an&s;wered by Dr. Littleton, who &s;ucceeded him in the office, from which he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and the pri&s;oners were executed as traitors. The Jacobites did not fail to retort tho&s;e arts upon the govern|ment, which their adver&s;aries had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed in the late reign. They inveighed again&s;t the vindictive &s;pirit of the admini&s;tration, and taxed it with encouraging informers and fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es; a charge for which there was too much foundation.</P>

<P>The friends of James in Scotland &s;till continued to concert de&s;igns in his favour; but, their corre&s;pondence was detected, and their aims defeated, by the vigilance of the mini&s;try in that kingdom. Secretary John&s;ton not only kept a watchful eye over all their tran&s;actions, but by a dextrous management of court|liberality and favour, appea&s;ed the di&s;contents of the pre&s;byterians &s;o effectually, that the king ran no ri&s;que in a&s;&s;embling the parliament. Some offices were be|&s;towed upon the leaders of the kirk-party; and the duke of Hamilton being recon|ciled to the government, was appointed commi&s;&s;ioner. On the eighteenth day of April, the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened, and the king's letter, replete with the mo&s;t cajoling
<PB N="112" REF="1150">
expre&s;&s;ions, being read, the parliament proceeded to exhibit undeniable &s;pecimens of their good humour. They drew up a very affectionate an&s;wer to his ma|je&s;ty's letter: They voted an addition of &s;ix new regiments to the &s;tanding forces of the kingdom: They granted a &s;upply of above one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling to his maje&s;ty: They enacted a law for levying men to &s;erve on board of the royal navy: They fined all ab&s;entees, whether lords or commons; and vacated the &s;eats of all tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners who refu&s;ed to take the oath of a&s;&s;urance, which was equivalent to an abjuration of king James: They &s;et on foot an inquiry about an intended inva&s;ion: They publi&s;hed &s;ome intercepted letters, &s;uppo&s;ed to be written to king James by Nevil Payne, whom they committed to pri&s;on, and threatened with a trial for high trea&s;on; but he $$uded the danger, by threatening in his turn to impeach tho&s;e who had made their peace with the government: They pa&s;&s;ed an act for the com|prehen&s;ion of &s;uch of the epi&s;copal clergy as &s;hould conde&s;cend to take the oaths by the tenth day of July. All that the general a&s;&s;embly required of them, was an offer to &s;ub&s;cribe the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and to acknowledge pre&s;bytery as the only government of the Scotti&s;h church: but they neither &s;ubmitted to the&s;e terms, nor took the oaths within the limited time; &s;o that they forfeited all legal right to their benefices. Neverthele&s;s, they continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and even received private a&s;&s;urances of the king's protection. It was one of William's political maxims to court his dome&s;tic enemies; but it was never attended with any good effect. This indulgence gave offence to the pre&s;byterians, and former di&s;tractions began to revive.</P>

<P>The king having prevailed upon the &s;tates-general to augment their land-forces and navy for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing compaign, embarked for England, and arrived at Ken&s;ington on the thirtieth day of October. Finding the people clamorous and di&s;contented, the trade of the nation decayed, the affairs of &s;tate mi&s;managed, and the mini&s;ters recriminating upon one an|other, he perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of changing hands, and re&s;olved to take his mea&s;ures accordingly. Sunderland his chief coun&s;ellor repre&s;ented, that the Tories were aver&s;e to the continuance of a war, which had been productive of nothing but damage and di&s;grace; whereas the Whigs were much more practicable, and would bleed freely, partly from the terrors of inva&s;ion and popery, partly from the ambition of being courted by the crown, and partly from the pro&s;pect of advantage, in advancing money to the government on the funds e&s;tabli&s;hed by parliament: for that &s;ort of traffic which obtained the appellation of the monied-intere&s;t, was altogether a whiggi&s;h in&s;titution. The king revolved the&s;e ob&s;ervations in his own mind; and, in the mean time, the parliament met on the &s;eventh day of November, pur&s;uant to the la&s;t pro|rogation. In his &s;peech he expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e who were authors of the mi&s;carriages at &s;ea; repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of increa&s;ing the land-forces and the navy, and demanded a &s;uitable &s;upply for the&s;e purpo&s;es. In order to pave the way to their conde&s;cen&s;ion, he had already di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his council the earl of Nottingham, who, of all his mini&s;ters, was the mo&s;t odious to the people. His place would have been immediately filled with the earl of Shrew&s;bury; but that nobleman &s;u&s;pecting this was a change of men rather than of mea&s;ures, &s;tood aloof for &s;ome time, until he received &s;uch a&s;&s;urances from the king as quieted his &s;cruples, and then he accepted the
<PB N="113" REF="1160">
office of &s;ecretary. The lieutenancy for the city of London, and all other commi&s;&s;ions over England, were altered with a view to favour the Whig in|tere&s;t; and the individuals of that party were indulged with many places of tru&s;t and profit: but the Tories were too powerful in the hou&s;e of commons to be exa&s;perated, and therefore a good number of them were retained in office.</P>

<P>On the &s;ixth day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion the commons unanimou&s;ly re|&s;olved to &s;upport their maje&s;ties and their government; to inquire into mi&s;|carriages; and to con&s;ider means for pre&s;erving the trade of the nation. The Turky company were &s;ummoned to produce the petitions they had delivered to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the admiralty for convoy; while lord Falkland, who &s;at at the head of that board, gave in copies of all the orders and directions &s;ent to Sir George Rooke concerning the Streights fleet, together with a li&s;t of all the &s;hips at that time in commi&s;&s;ion. It appeared, in the cour&s;e of this inquiry, that the mi&s;carriage of Rooke's fleet was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the mi&s;|conduct of the admirals, and neglect of the victualing-office; but they were &s;kreened by a majority. Mr. Harley, one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for taking and &s;tating the public accounts, delivered a report which contained a charge of pe|culation again&s;t lord Falkland. Rainsford, receiver of the rights and perqui|&s;ites of the navy, confe&s;&s;ed that he had received and payed more money than that which was charged in the accompts; and, in particular, that he had payed four thou&s;and pounds to lord Falkland, by his maje&s;ty's order. This lord had acknowledged before the commi&s;&s;ioners, that he had payed one half of the &s;um, by the king's order, to a per&s;on who was not a member of either hou&s;e; and that the remainder was &s;till in his hands. Rainsford owned he had the original letter which he received from Falkland, demanding the money; and this nobleman de&s;iring to &s;ee it, detained the voucher; a circum&s;tance that incen&s;ed the commons to &s;uch a degree, that a motion was made for commit|ting him to the Tower, and debated with great warmth, but at la&s;t over-ruled by the majority. Neverthele&s;s, they agreed to make him &s;en&s;ible of their di&s;plea&s;ure, and he was reprimanded in his place. The hou&s;e of lords having al&s;o inquired into the cau&s;es of the mi&s;carriage at &s;ea, very violent debates aro&s;e, and at length the majority re&s;olved, that the admirals had done well in the execution of the orders they had received. This was a triumph over the Whig lords, who had &s;o eagerly pro&s;ecuted the affair, and now prote&s;ted again&s;t the re&s;olution, not without great appearance of rea&s;on. The next &s;tep of the lords, was to exculpate the earl of Nottingham, as the blame &s;eemed to lie with him, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the admirals were innocent. With a view therefore to transfer this blame to Trenchard the whiggi&s;h &s;ecretary, he gave the hou&s;e to under&s;tand, that he had received from Paris intelligence in the beginning of June, containing, a li&s;t of the enemy's fleet, and the time of their &s;ailing; that this was communicated to a committee of the council, and particularly imparted to &s;ecretary Trenchard, who&s;e province it was to tran&s;mit in&s;tructions to the admirals. Two conferences pa&s;&s;ed on this &s;ubject between the lords and commons. Trenchard delivered in his defence in writ|ing; and was in his turn &s;kreened by the whole efforts of the mini&s;try, in which the Whig influence now predominated. Thus an inquiry of &s;uch na|tional con&s;equence, which took its ri&s;e from the king's own expre&s;&s;ion of re|&s;entment again&s;t the delinquents, was &s;tifled by the arts of the court, becau&s;e
<PB N="114" REF="1170">
it was likely to affect one of its creatures: for, though there was no premedi|tated treachery in the ca&s;e, the intere&s;t of the public was certainly &s;acrificed to the mutual animo&s;ity of the mini&s;ters. The charge of lord Falkland being re&s;umed in the hou&s;e of commons, he appeared to have begged and received of the king, the remaining two thou&s;and pounds of the money which had been payed by Rainsford: he was therefore declared guilty of a high mi&s;de|meanor and breach of tru&s;t, and committed to the Tower; from whence, however, he was in two days di&s;charged upon his petition.</P>

<P>Harley, Foley, and Harcourt, pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e a &s;tate of the receipts and i&s;&s;ues of the revenue, together with two reports from the commi&s;&s;ioners of the accounts, concerning &s;ums i&s;&s;ued for &s;ecret-&s;ervices, and to members of parliament. This was a di&s;covery of the mo&s;t &s;candalous prac|tices in the my&s;tery of corruption, equally exerci&s;ed on the individuals of both parties, in occa&s;ional bounties, grants, places, pen&s;ions, equivalents, and additional &s;alaries. The malcontents therefore ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, the hou&s;e of commons was &s;o managed that the king could baffle any bill, qua&s;h all grievances, &s;tifle accounts, and rectify the articles of Limerick. When the commons took into con&s;ider|ation the e&s;timates and &s;upplies of the en&s;uing year, the king demanded forty thou&s;and men for the navy, and above one hundred thou&s;and for the purpo&s;es of the land-&s;ervice. Before the hou&s;e con&s;idered the&s;e enormous demands, they granted four hundred thou&s;and pounds by way of advance, to quiet the clamours of the &s;eamen, who were become mutinous and de&s;perate for want of pay, upwards of one million being due to them for wages. Then the com|mons voted the number of men required for the navy: but they were &s;o a&s;hamed of that for the army, that they thought it nece&s;&s;ary to act in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould imply that they &s;till retained &s;ome regard for their country. They called for all the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the king and his allies: they ex|amined the different proportions of the troops furni&s;hed by the re&s;pective powers: they con&s;idered the intended augmentations, and fixed the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the year at four&s;core and three thou&s;and, one hundred and one and twenty men, including officers. For the maintenance of the&s;e they allotted the &s;um of two millions five hundred and thirty thou&s;and, five hundred and ninety pounds. They granted two millions for the navy, and about five hundred thou&s;and to make good the deficiencies of the annuity and poll-bills; &s;o that the &s;up|plies for the year amounted to about five millions and a half, rai&s;ed by a land-tax of four &s;hillings in the pound, by two more lives in the annuities, a further exci&s;e on beer, a new duty on &s;alt, and a lo$$ery.</P>

<P>Though the malcontents in parliament could not with&s;tand this torrent of profu&s;ion, they endeavoured to di&s;tre&s;s the court-intere&s;t, by re|viving the popular bills of the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ions; &s;uch as that of regulating trials in ca&s;es of high-trea&s;on, the other for the more frequent calling and meeting of parliaments, and that concerning free and impartial proceedings in parliament. The fir&s;t was neglected in the hou&s;e of lords; the &s;econd was re|jected; the third was pa&s;&s;ed by the commons, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that it would be defeated in the other hou&s;e. The lords returned it with certain amend|ments, to which the commons would not agree: a conference en&s;ued; the peers receded from their corrections, and pa&s;&s;ed the bill, to which the king, however, refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent. Nothing could be more unpopular and danger|ous
<PB N="115" REF="1180">
than &s;uch a &s;tep at this juncture. The commons, in order to recover &s;ome credit with the people, determined to di&s;approve of his maje&s;ty's conduct. The hou&s;e formed it&s;elf into a committee, to take the &s;tate of the kingdom into con&s;ideration. They re&s;olved, that whoever advi&s;ed the king to refu&s;e the royal a&s;&s;ent to that bill, was an enemy to their maje&s;ties and the king|dom. They likewi&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, expre&s;&s;ing their concern that he had not given his con&s;ent to the bill, and be&s;eeching his maje&s;ty to hearken for the future to the advice of his parliament, rather than to the coun&s;els of particular per&s;ons, who might have private intere&s;ts of their own, &s;eparate from tho&s;e of his maje&s;ty and his people. The king thanked them for their zeal, profe&s;&s;ed a warm regard for their con&s;titution; and a&s;&s;ured them he would look upon all parties as enemies, who &s;hould endeavour to le&s;&s;en the confidence &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the &s;overeign and people. The members in the oppo&s;ition were not at all &s;atisfied with this general reply. A day being appointed to take it into con&s;ideration, a warm debate was maintained with equal eloquence and acrimony. At length the que&s;tion being put, that an addre&s;s &s;hould be made for a more explicit an&s;wer, it pa&s;&s;ed in the negative by a great majority.</P>

<P>The city of London petitioned that a parliamentary provi&s;ion might be made for the orphans who&s;e fortunes they had &s;candalou&s;ly &s;quandered away. Such an application had been made in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, and re|jected with di&s;dain as an impo&s;ition on the public: but now tho&s;e &s;cruples were removed, and they pa&s;&s;ed a bill for this purpo&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of many clau&s;es, extending to different charges on the city lands, aqueducts, per&s;onal e&s;tates, and impo&s;ing duties on binding apprentices, con&s;tituting freemen, as al&s;o upon wines and coals imported into London. On the twenty-third day of March the&s;e bills received the royal a&s;&s;ent; and the king took that opportunity of recommending di&s;patch, as the &s;ea&s;on of the year was far advanced, and the enemy diligently employed in making preparations for an early campaign. The &s;cheme of a national bank, like tho&s;e of Am&s;terdam and Genoa, had been recommended to the mini&s;try, as an excellent in&s;titution, as well for the credit and &s;ecurity of the government, as for the increa&s;e of trade and circulation. One project was invented by doctor Hugh Chamberlain, propo&s;ing the circulation of tickets on land-&s;ecurity: but William Pater&s;on was author of that which was carried into execution by the intere&s;t of Michael Godfrey, and other active pro|jectors. The &s;cheme was founded on the notion of a transferable fund, and a circulation by bill, on the credit of a large capital. Forty merchants &s;ub&s;cribed to the amount of five hundred thou&s;and pounds, as a fund of ready money to circulate one million at eight per cent. to be lent to the government; and even this fund of ready money bore the &s;ame intere&s;t. When it was properly dige&s;ted in the cabinet, and a majority in parliament &s;ecured for its reception, the undertakers for the court introduced it into the hou&s;e of commons, and ex|patiated upon the national advantages that would accrue from &s;uch a mea&s;ure. They &s;aid it would re&s;cue the nation out of the hands of extortioners and u&s;urers, lower intere&s;t, rai&s;e the value of land, revive and e&s;tabli&s;h public credit, facilitate the annual &s;upplies, and connect the people the more clo&s;ely with the government. The project was violently oppo&s;ed by a &s;trong party, who af|firmed that it would become a monopoly, and engro&s;s the whole money of the kingdom: that, as it mu&s;t infallibly be &s;ub&s;ervie$t to government views, it might be employed to the wor&s;t purpo&s;es of arbitrary power: that, in&s;tead of
<PB N="116" REF="1190">
a&s;&s;i&s;ting, it would weaken commerce, by tempting people to withdraw their money from trade, and employ it in &s;tock-jobbing: that it would produce a &s;warm of brokers and jobbers to prey upon their fellow-creatures, enourage fraud and gaming, and further corrupt the morals of the nation. Notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e objections, the bill made its way through the two hou&s;es, e&s;tab|li&s;hing the funds for the &s;ecurity and advantage of the &s;ub&s;cribers; impowering their maje&s;ties to incorporate them by the name of The governor and company of the bank of England, under a provi&s;o, that at any time after the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and five, upon a year's no|tice, and the repayment of the twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds, the &s;aid cor|poration &s;hould cea&s;e and determine. The bill likewi&s;e contained clau&s;es of appropriation for the &s;ervices of the public. The whole &s;ub&s;cription was filled in ten days after its being opened; and the court of directors com|pleted the payment before the expiration of the time pre&s;cribed by the act, although they did not call in more than &s;even hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds of the money &s;ub&s;cribed. All the&s;e funds proving in|adequate to the e&s;timates, the commons brought in a bill to impo&s;e &s;tamp-duties upon all velum, parchment, and paper, u&s;ed in almo&s;t every kind of intercour&s;e between man and man; and they crowned the oppre&s;&s;ions of the year with another grievous tax upon carriages, under the name of a bill for licen&s;ing and regulating hackney and &s;tage-coaches.</P>

<P>The commons, in a clau&s;e of the bill for taxing &s;everal joint-&s;tocks, provided, that in ca&s;e of a default in the payment of that tax, within the time limited by the act, the charter of the company &s;o failing &s;hould be deemed void and forfeited. The Ea&s;t-India company actually neglected their payment; and the public imagined the mini&s;try would &s;eize this oportunity of di&s;&s;olving a monopoly again&s;t which &s;o many complaints had been made: but they under|&s;tood their own &s;trength; and, in&s;tead of being broke, obtained the promi&s;e of a new charter. This was no &s;ooner known, than the controver&s;y between them and their adver&s;aries was revived with &s;uch animo&s;ity, that the council thought proper to indulge both parties with a hearing. As this produced no re&s;olution, the merchants who oppo&s;ed the company petitioned that, in the mean while, the new charter might be &s;u&s;pended. Addre&s;&s;es of the &s;ame kind were pre|&s;ented by a great number of clothiers, linen-drapers, and other dealers. To the&s;e a written an&s;wer was publi&s;hed by the company: the merchants printed a reply, in which they undertook to prove, that the company had been guilty of unju&s;t and unwarrantable actions, tending to the &s;candal of religion, the di&s;honour of the nation, the reproach of our laws, the oppre&s;&s;ion of the people, and the ruin of the trade. They ob&s;erved, that two private &s;hips had exported in one year three times as many cloths as the company had exported in three years. They offered to &s;end more cloth and Engli&s;h merchandi&s;e to the Indies in one year, than the company had exported in five; to furni&s;h the govern|ment with five hundred tons of &s;alt-petre for le&s;s than one half of the u&s;ual price; and they repre&s;ented, that the company could neither load the &s;hips they petitioned for in England, nor reload them in the Ea&s;t Indies. In &s;pite of all the&s;e remon&s;trances, the new charter pa&s;&s;ed the great &s;eal; though the grants contained in it were limited in &s;uch a manner, that they did not amount to an exclu&s;ive privilege, and &s;ubjected the company to &s;uch alterations, re|&s;trictions, and qualifications, as the king &s;hould direct before the twenty-ninth
<PB N="117" REF="1200">
day of September. This indulgence, and other favours granted to the com|pany, were privately purcha&s;ed of the mini&s;try, and became productive of a loud outcry again&s;t the government. The merchants publi&s;hed a journal of the whole tran&s;action: they petitioned the hou&s;e of commons, that their liberty of trading to the Ea&s;t-Indies might be confirmed by parliament. Another pe|tition was pre&s;ented by the company, praying that their charter might receive a parliamentary &s;anction. Both parties employed all their addre&s;s in making private application to the members. The hou&s;e having examined the different charters, the book of their new &s;ub&s;criptions, and every particular relating to the company, re&s;olved that all the &s;ubjects of England had an equal right to trade to the Ea&s;t Indies, unle&s;s prohibited by act of parliament.</P>

<P>But nothing engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the public more than a bill which was brought into the hou&s;e for a general naturalization of all fo|reign prote&s;tants. The advocates for this mea&s;ure alledged, That great part of the lands of England lay uncultivated: That the &s;trength of a nation con|&s;i&s;ted in the number of inhabitants: That the people were thinned by the war and foreign voyages, and required an extraordinary &s;upply: That a great num|ber of prote&s;tants, per&s;ecuted in France and other countries, would gladly remove to a land of freedom, and bring along with them their wealth and ma|nufactures: That the community had been largely repayed for the protection granted to tho&s;e refugees who had already &s;ettled in the kingdom. They had introduced &s;everal new branches of manufacture, promoted indu&s;try, and lowered the price of labour, a circum&s;tance of the utmo&s;t importance to trade, op|pre&s;&s;ed as it was with taxes, and expo&s;ed to uncommon hazard from the enemy. The opponents of the bill urged with great vehemence, That it would cheapen the birthright of Engli&s;hmen: That the want of culture was owing to the op|pre&s;&s;ion of the times: That foreigners being admitted into the privileges of the Briti&s;h trade, would grow wealthy at the expence of their benefactors, and transfer the fortunes they had gained into their native country: That the re|duction in the price of labour would be a national grievance, while many thou&s;ands of Engli&s;h manufacturers were &s;tarving for want of employment, and the price of provi&s;ions continued &s;o high that even tho&s;e who were em|ployed could &s;carce &s;upply their families with bread: That the real de&s;ign of the bill was to make &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion to the di&s;&s;enters as would render them an equal match in the body-politic for tho&s;e of the church of England; to create a greater dependence on the crown, and, in a word, to &s;upply a foreign head with foreign members. Sir John Knight, a member of the hou&s;e, in a &s;peech upon this &s;ubject, exaggerated the bad con&s;equences that would attend &s;uch a bill, with all the wit and virulence of &s;atire: it was printed and di&s;|per&s;ed through the kingdom, and rai&s;ed &s;uch a flame among the people as had not appeared &s;ince the revolution. They exclaimed, that all offices would be conferred upon Dutchmen, who would become Lord danes, and pre&s;cribe the modes of religion and government; and they extolled Sir John Knight as the &s;aviour of the nation. The courtiers, incen&s;ed at the progre&s;s of this clamour, complained in the hou&s;e of the &s;peech, which had been printed; and Sir John was threatened with expul&s;ion and impri&s;onment. He therefore<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Feuquieres. Life of king William.</NOTE> thought proper to di&s;own the paper, which was burned by the hands of the common hangman.

<P>Lord Coning&s;by and Mr. Porter had committed the mo&s;t flagrant acts of oppre&s;&s;ion in Ireland. The&s;e had been explained during the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, by the gentlemen who appealed again&s;t the admini&s;tration of lord Sidney: but they were &s;creened by the mini&s;try; and therefore the earl of Bellamont now impeached them in the hou&s;e of commons, of which he and they were members. After an examination of the articles exhibited again&s;t them, the commons, who were by this time at the devotion of the court, de|clared, that con&s;idering the &s;tate of affairs in Ireland, they did not think them<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1694.</NOTE> fit grounds for an impeachment. In the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the nation &s;u&s;tained another misfortune in the fate of Sir Francis Wheeler, who had been appointed commander in chief of the Mediterranean &s;quadron. He received in&s;tructions to take under his convoy the merchant &s;hips bound to Turkey, Spain, and Italy; to crui&s;e thirty days in a certain latitude, for the protection of the Spani&s;h plate-fleet homeward bound; to leave part of his &s;quadron at Cadiz, as convoy to the trade for England; to proceed with the re&s;t to the Mediterranean; to join the Spani&s;h fleet in his return; and to act in concert with them, until he &s;hould be joined by the fleet from Turkey and the Streights, and accompany them back to England. About the latter end of October he &s;et &s;ail from St. Helen's, and in January arrived at Cadiz with the &s;hips under his convoy. There leaving rear-admiral Hop&s;on, he proceeded for the Medi|terranean. In the bay of Gibraltar he was overtaken with a dreadful tempe&s;t, under a lee-&s;hore, which he could not po&s;&s;ibly weather, and where the ground was &s;o foul that no anchor would hold. This expedient, however, was tried. A great number of &s;hips were driven a&s;hore, and many peri&s;hed. The admi|ral's &s;hip foundered at &s;ea, and he and all his crew were buried in the deep, ex|cept two Moors, who were miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved. Two other &s;hips of the line, three ketches, and &s;ix merchant &s;hips, were lo&s;t. The remains of the fleet were &s;o much &s;hattered, that in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting their voyage, they re|turned to Cadiz in order to be refitted, and &s;heltered from the attempts of the French &s;quadrons, which were &s;till at &s;ea, under the command of Chateau-Renaud and Gabaret. On the twenty-fifth day of April the king clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech in the u&s;ual &s;tile, and the parliament was prorogued to the eighteenth day of September <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Be&s;ides the bills already mentioned, the par|liament in this &s;e&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed an act for taking and &s;lating the public accounts; another to encourage &s;hip-building; a third for the better di&s;ciplining the navy; the u&s;ual militia act, and an act enab|ling his maje&s;ty to make grants and lea&s;es in the dutchy of Cornwal. One was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed for renewing a clau&s;e in an old &s;tatute limiting the number of ju&s;tices of the peace in the principality of Wales. The duke of Norfolk brought an action into the court of king's-bench again&s;t Mr. Jermaine, for criminal conver&s;ation with his dutch|e&s;s. The cau&s;e was tried, and the jury brought in their verdict for one hundred marks and co&s;ts of &s;uit, in favour of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>Before the king embarked, he gratified a good number of his friends with promotions. Lord Charles Butler, brother to the duke of Ormond, was created lord Butler of We&s;ton in England, and earl of Arran in Ireland. The earl of Shrew&s;bury was honoured with the title of duke. The earl of Mulgrave being reconciled to the court-mea&s;ures, was gratified with a pen|&s;ion of three thou&s;and pounds, and the title of marquis of Normanby. Henry Herbert was ennobled by the title of baron Herbert of Cherbury. The earls of Bedford, Devon&s;hire, and Clare, were promoted to the rank of dukes. The marquis of Carmarthen was made duke of Leeds, lord vi&s;count Sidney earl of Rumney, and the vi&s;count Newport earl of Bedford. Ru&s;|&s;el was advanced to the head of the admiralty-board. Sir George Rooke and Sir John Houblon were appointed joint-commi&s;&s;ioners in the room of Killegrew and Delaval. Charles Montague was made chancellor of the exchequer; Sir Wil|liam Trumbal and John Smith commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury, in the room of Sir Edward Sey|mour and Mr. Hambden.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>Lewis of France being tired of the war, which had impoveri&s;hed his country, continued to tamper with the duke of Savoy, and, by the canal of the pope, made &s;ome offers to the king of Spain, which were rejected. Mean while he re&s;olved to &s;tand upon the defen&s;ive during the en&s;uing cam|paign, in every part but Catalonia, where his whole naval force might co|operate with the count de Noailles, who commanded the land-army. King William having received intelligence of their de&s;ign upon Bareelona, en|deavoured to prevent the junction of the Bre&s;t and Toulon &s;quadrons, by &s;end|ing Ru&s;&s;el to &s;ea as early as the fleet could be in a condition to &s;ail: but, be|fore he arrived at Port&s;mouth, the Bre&s;t &s;quadron had quitted that harbour. On the third day of May the admiral &s;ailed from St. Helen's, with the combined &s;quadrons of England and Holland, amounting to ninety &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates, fire-&s;hips, and tenders. He detached captain Pritchard of the Monmouth with two fire-&s;hips to de&s;troy a fleet of French merchant-&s;hips near Conquet-bay; and this &s;ervice being performed, he re|turned to St. Helen's, where he had left Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel with a &s;qua|dron, to take on board a body of land-forces, intended for a de&s;cent upon the coa&s;t of France. The&s;e being embarked, under the command of general Tal|ma&s;h, the whole fleet &s;ailed again on the twenty-ninth of May. The land and &s;ea-officers, in a council of war, agreed that part of the fleet de&s;igned for this expedition, &s;hould &s;eparate from the re&s;t, and proceed to Camaret bay, where the forces &s;hould be landed. On the fifth day of June, lord Berkeley, who commanded this &s;quadron, parted with the grand fleet, and on the &s;eventh anchored between the bays of Camaret and Bertaume. Next day the marquis of Carmarthen, afterwards duke of Leeds, who &s;erved under Berkeley, as rear-admiral of the blue, entered Camaret bay with two large &s;hips and &s;ix frigates, to cover the troops in landing. The French had received intelligence of the de&s;ign, and taken &s;uch precautions, under the con|duct of the celebrated engineer Vauban, that the Engli&s;h were expo&s;ed to a terrible fire from new-erected batteries, as well as from a &s;trong body of troops; and, though the &s;hips cannonaded them with great vigour, the &s;oldiers could not maintain any regularity in landing. A good number were killed in the open boats before they reached the &s;hore; and tho&s;e who landed were &s;oon repul&s;ed, in &s;pite of all the endeavours of general Talma&s;h, who received a wound in the thigh which proved mortal. Seven hundred &s;oldiers are &s;aid to have been lo&s;t on this occa&s;ion, be&s;ides tho&s;e that were killed on board of the &s;hips. The Monk &s;hip of war was towed off with great difficulty; but a Dutch frigate of thirty guns fell into the hands of the enemy.</P>

<P>After this unfortunate attempt, lord Berkeley, with the advice of a council of war, &s;ailed back for England, and at St. Helen's received orders from the queen to call a council, and deliberate in what manner the &s;hips
<PB N="120" REF="1230">
and forces might be be&s;t employed. They agreed to make &s;ome attempt upon the coa&s;t of Normandy. With this view they &s;et &s;ail on the fifth day of July. They bombarded Dieppe, and reduced the greate&s;t part of the town to a&s;hes. Thence they &s;teered to Havre de Grace, which met with the &s;ame fate. They harra&s;&s;ed the French troops, who marched after them along-&s;hore. They alarmed the whole coa&s;t, and $$lled every town with &s;uch con&s;ternation, that they would have been abandoned by the inhabitants, had not they been de|tained by military force. On the twenty-&s;ixth day of July, lord Berkeley re|turned to St. Helen's, where he quitted the fleet, and the command devolved upon Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel. This officer having received in&s;tructions to make an attempt upon Dunkirk, &s;ailed round to the Downs, where he was joined by M. Mee&s;ters, with &s;ix and twenty Dutch pilots. On the twelfth of September he appeared before Dunkirk; and next day &s;ent in the Charles galley, with two bomb-ketches, and as many of the machines called Infernals. The&s;e were &s;et on fire without effect; and the de&s;ign mi&s;carried: then Shovel &s;teered for Ca|lais, which having bombarded with little &s;ucce&s;s, he returned to the coa&s;t of England; and the bomb-ketches and machines were &s;ent into the river Thames.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, admiral Ru&s;&s;el with the grand fleet &s;ailed for the Mediterranean; and being joined by rear-admiral Neville from Cadiz, toge|ther with Callembergh and Evertzen, he &s;teered towards Barcelona, which was be&s;ieged by the French fleet and army. At his approach Tourville retired with precipitation into the harbour of Toulon; and Noailles abandoned his enter|prize. The Spani&s;h affairs were in &s;uch a deplorable condition, that without this timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance the kingdom mu&s;t have been undone. While he continued in the Mediterranean, the French admiral dur&s;t not venture to appear at &s;ea; and all his projects were di&s;concerted. After having a&s;&s;erted the honour of the Bri|ti&s;h flag in tho&s;e &s;eas during the whole &s;ummer, he &s;ailed, in the beginning of November to Cadiz, where, by an expre&s;s order of the king, he pa&s;&s;ed the winter, during which, he took &s;uch precautions for preventing Tourville from pa&s;&s;ing the Streights, that he did not think proper to ri&s;que the pa&s;&s;age.</P>

<P>It will now be nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the operations on the continent. In the middle of May king William arrived in Holland, where he con&s;ulted with the &s;tates-general. On the third day of June he repaired to Bertherme abbey near Louvain, the place appointed for the rendezvous of the army; and there he was met by the electors of Bavaria and Cologne. In a few days a nu|merous army was a&s;&s;embled; and every thing &s;eemed to promi&s;e an active cam|paign. On the third day of June the dauphin took the command of the French forces, with which Luxembourg had taken po&s;t between Mons and Maubeuge; and pa&s;&s;ing the Sambre, encamped at Fleurus: but, on the eigh|teenth, he removed from thence, and took up his quarters between St. Tron and Wanheim; while the confederates lay at Roo&s;beck. On the eleventh of July, the dauphin matched in four columns to Oerle upon the Jaar, where he pitched his camp. On the twenty-&s;econd, the confederates marched to Bomale: then the dauphin took the route to Vignamont, where he &s;ecured his army by in|trenchments, as his forces were inferior in number to tho&s;e of the allies; and he had been directed by his father to avoid an engagement. In this &s;ituation both armies remained till the fifteenth day of Augu&s;t, when king William &s;ent
<PB N="121" REF="1240">
the heavy baggage to Louvain; and on the eighteenth made a motion to Som|bref. This was no &s;ooner known to the enemy, than they decamped; and having marched all night, po&s;ted them&s;elves between Tempion and Ma&s;y, within a league and an half of the confederates. The king of England re&s;olved to pa&s;s the Scheld; and with this view marched by the way of Neville and Soignies, to Chivere: from thence he detached the duke of Wirtemberg, with a &s;trong body of hor&s;e and foot, to pa&s;s the river at Oudenarde, while the elector of Bavaria advanced with another detachment to pa&s;s it at Pont D'E&s;pieres. Not|with&s;tanding all the expedition they could make, their purpo&s;e was anticipated by Luxembourg, who being apprized of their route, had detached four thou|&s;and hor&s;e, with each a foot &s;oldier behind the trooper, to reinforce Mr. de Valette, who commanded that part of the French lines. The&s;e were &s;u&s;tained by a choice body of men, who travelled with great expedition, without ob&s;erving the formalities of a march. The marechal de Villeroy followed the &s;ame route, with all the cavalry of the right wing, the hou&s;hold-troops, and twenty field-pieces; and the re&s;t of the army was brought up by the dauphin in per&s;on. They marched with &s;uch incredible diligence, that the elector of Bavaria could &s;carce believe his own eyes, when he arrived in &s;ight of the Scheld, and &s;aw them entrenching them&s;elves on the other &s;ide of the river. King William hav|ing reconnoitred their di&s;po&s;ition, thought it impracticable to pa&s;s at that place, and therefore marched down the river to Oudenarde, where the pa&s;&s;age had been already effected by the duke of Wirtemberg. Here the confederates pa&s;&s;ed the Scheld on the twenty-&s;eventh day of the month; and the king fixed his head-quarters at Wanneghem. His intention was to have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Courtray, and e&s;tabli&s;h winter-quarters for a con&s;iderable part of his army in that di&s;trict; but, Luxembourg having po&s;ted him&s;elf between that place and Menin, extended his lines in &s;uch a manner, that the confederates could not attempt to force them, nor even hinder him from &s;ub&s;i&s;ting his army at the expence of the ca&s;tellany of Courtray, during the remainder of the cam|paign. This &s;urpri&s;ing march was of &s;uch importance to the French king, that he wrote with his own hand a letter of thanks to his army; and ordered that it &s;hould be read to every particular &s;quadron and battalion.</P>

<P>The king of England, though di&s;appointed in his &s;cheme upon Courtray, found means to make &s;ome advantage of his &s;uperiority in number. He draughted troops from the garri&s;ons of Liege and Mae&s;tricht; and on the third day of September reinforced this body with a large detachment from his own camp, conferring the command upon the duke of Hol&s;tein-Ploen, with orders to undertake the &s;iege of Huy. Next day, the whole confederate forces pa&s;&s;ed the Lys, and encamped at Wenterghem. From thence the king, with part of the army, marched to Ro&s;elaer; and this divi&s;ion obliged the dauphin to make con&s;iderable detachments for the &s;ecurity of Ypres and Menin, on one &s;ide, and to cover Furnes and Dunkirk on the other. At this juncture, a French|man being &s;eized in the very act of &s;etting fire to one of the ammunition-wag|gons in the allied army, confe&s;&s;ed he had been employed for this purpo&s;e by &s;ome of the French generals; and &s;uffered death as a traitor. On the &s;ixteenth day of the month, the duke of Hol&s;tein-Ploen inve&s;ted Huy, and carried on the &s;iege with &s;uch vigour, that in ten days the garri&s;on capitulated. The king ordered Dixmuyde, Deyn&s;e, Ninove, and Tirlemont, to be &s;ecured for winterquarters

<P>The operations on the Rhine had been preconcerted between king William and the prince of Baden, who vi&s;ited London in the winter. The di|&s;pute between the emperor and the elector of Saxony was compromi&s;ed; and this young prince dying during the negotiation, the treaty was perfected by his brother and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who engaged to furni&s;h twelve thou&s;and men yearly, in con&s;ideration of a &s;ub&s;idy from the court of Vienna. In the beginning of June, the marechal de Lorges pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Philip&s;burg, in order to give battle to the Imperiali&s;ts, encamped at Hailbron. The prince of Baden, who was not yet joined by the Saxons, He&s;&s;ians, nor by the troops of Mun&s;ter and Pader|born, di&s;patched couriers to quicken the march of the&s;e auxiliaries, and ad|vanced to Eppingen, where he propo&s;ed to wait until they &s;hould come up: but, on the fifteenth, receiving undoubted intelligence, that the enemy were in motion towards him, he advanced to meet them in order of battle. De Lorges concluded, that this was a de&s;perate effort, and immediately halted, to make the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for an engagement. This pau&s;e enabled prince Lewis to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong pa&s;s near Sintzheim, from which he could not ea&s;ily be di&s;lodged. Then the ma$$chal proceeded to Vi&s;eloch, and ravaged the adjacent country, in hope of drawing the Imperiali&s;ts from their intrench|ments. The prince being joined by the He&s;&s;ians, re&s;olved to beat up the quarters of the enemy; and the French general being apprized of his de&s;ign, retreated at midnight with the utmo&s;t precipitation. Having po&s;ted him&s;elf at Ruth, he &s;ent his heavy baggage to Philip&s;burg; then he moved to Gon&s;bergh in the neighbourhood of Manheim, repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, and encamped between Spires and Worms. The prince of Baden being joined by the allies, pa&s;&s;ed the river by a bridge of boats near Hagenbach, in the middle of September; and layed the country of Al&s;ace under contribution. Con&s;idering the advanced &s;ea&s;on of the year, this was a ra&s;h undertaking; and the French general re&s;olved to profit by his enemy's temerity. He forthwith advanced again&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts, fore|&s;eeing that &s;hould they be wor&s;ted in battle, their whole army would be ruined. Prince Lewis, informed of his intention, immediately repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine; and this retreat was no &s;ooner effected, than the river &s;welled to &s;uch a degree, that the i&s;land in the middle, and great part of the camp he had occupied, was overflowed. Soon after this incident both armies retired into winter-quarters. The campaign in Hungary produced no event of importance. It was opened by the new vizi$, who arrived at Belgrade in the middle of Augu&s;t; and about the &s;ame time Ca$rara a&s;&s;embled the Imperial army in the neighbourhood of Peterwara$$n. The Turks pa&s;&s;ed the Saave, in order to attack their camp, and carried on their approaches with five hundred pieces of cannon, but made very little progre&s;s. The Imperiali&s;ts received reinforcements; the &s;ea&s;on wa&s;ted away; a feud aro&s;e between the vizir and the cham of the Tartars; and the Danube being &s;welled by heavy rains, &s;o as to interrupt the operations of the Turks, their general decamped in the night on the fir&s;t day of October. They afterwards made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon Titul, while the Imperial general made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Giula. In the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer, the Ve|$$tians, who were al&s;o at war with the Turks, reduced Cy$lut, a place of im|portance

<P>We have already ob&s;erved, that the French king had determined to act vigorou&s;ly in Catalonia. In the beginning of May, the duke de No$illes ad|vanced at the head of eight and twenty thou&s;and men to the river Ter, on the op|po&s;ite bank of which the viceroy of Catalonia was encamped with &s;ixteen thou&s;and Spaniards. The French general pa&s;&s;ed the river in the face of this army, and attacked their intrenchments with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that in le&s;s than an hour they were totally defeated. Then he marched to Palamos, and undertook the &s;iege of that place, while at the &s;ame time it was blocked up by the combined &s;quadrons of Bre&s;t and Toulon. Though the be&s;ieged made an ob&s;tinate defence, the town was taken by &s;torm, the hou&s;es were pillaged, and the people put to the &s;word, without di&s;tinction of age, &s;ex, or condition.

<P>England had continued very quiet under the queen's admini&s;tra|tion, if we except &s;ome little commotions occa&s;ioned by the practices, or pre|tended practices of the Jacobites. Pro&s;ecutions were revived again&s;t certain gentlemen of Lanca&s;hire and Che&s;hire, for having been concerned in the con|&s;piracy formed in favour of the late king's projected inva&s;ion from Normandy. The&s;e &s;teps were owing to the &s;ugge&s;tions of infamous informers, whom the mini&s;try countenanced. Colonel Parker and one Cro&s;by were impri&s;oned, and bills of trea&s;on found again&s;t them; but, Parker made his e&s;cape from the Tower, and was never retaken, though a reward of four hundred pounds was &s;et upon his head. The king having &s;ettled the affairs of the confederacy at the Hague, embarked for England on the eighth of November, and next day landed at Margate. On the twelfth he opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, with a &s;peech, in which he ob&s;erved that the po&s;ture of affairs was improved both by &s;ea and land &s;ince they la&s;t parted; in particular, that a &s;top was put to the progre&s;s of the French arms. He demanded &s;uch &s;upplies as would enable him to pro&s;ecute the war with vigour. He de&s;ired they would continue the act of tonnage and poundage, which would expire at Chri&s;tmas: he reminded them of the debt for the tran&s;port &s;hips employed in the reduction of Ireland; and exhorted them to prepare &s;ome good bill for the encouragement of &s;eamen. A majority in both hou&s;es was already &s;ecured; and in all probability, he bar|gained

The commons having examined the e&s;timates and accounts, voted four millions, &s;even hundred &s;ixty-four thou&s;and, &s;even hundred and twelve pounds for the &s;ervice of the army and navy. In order to rai&s;e this &s;um, they continued the land-tax.

<P>THE kingdom now re&s;ounded with the complaints of the papi&s;ts and malcontents, who taxed the mini&s;try with &s;ubornation of perjury, in the ca&s;e of the Lanca&s;hire gentlemen who had been pro&s;ecuted for the con&s;piracy. One Lunt, an Iri&s;hman, had informed Sir John Trenchard &s;e|cretary
<PB N="127" REF="1300">
of &s;tate, that he had been &s;ent from Ireland with commi&s;&s;ions from king James to divers gentlemen in Lanca&s;hire and Che&s;hire: that he had a&s;|&s;i&s;ted in buying arms, and enli&s;ting men to $$rve that king in his projected in|va&s;ion of England: that he had been twice di&s;patched by tho&s;e gentlemen to the court of St. Germain's, $$$i&s;ted many Jacobites in repairing to France, helped to conceal others that came from that kingdom; and that all tho&s;e per&s;ons told him they were furni&s;hed with money by Sir John Friend for tho&s;e expeditions. His te&s;timony was confirmed by other infamous emi&s;&s;aries, who received but too much countenance from the government. Blank warrants were i&s;&s;ued, and filled up occa&s;ionally with &s;uch names as the informers $ug|ge&s;ted. The&s;e were delivered $o Aaron Smith, &s;olli$ito$ to the trea&s;ury, who, with me&s;&s;engers, accompanied Lunt and his a&s;&s;oc$ates to Lanca&s;hire, under the protection of a party of Dutch hor&s;e-guards, commanded by one captain Baker. They were impowered to break open hou&s;es, &s;eize papers, and apprehend per|&s;ons, according to their plea&s;ure$ and they committed many act$ of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion. The per&s;ons again&s;t whom $he&s;e mea&s;$res were taken, being appri&s;ed of the impending danger, generally retired from their own habita|tions. Some, however, were taken and impri&s;o$ed: a few arms were &s;ecured, and, in the hou&s;e of Mr. Standi&s;h, at Standi&s;h-hall, they found the draught of a declaration to be publi&s;hed by king James at his landing. As this pro&s;ecu|tion &s;eemed calculated to revive the rumour of a &s;tale con&s;piracy, and the evidences were per&s;ons of abandoned characters, the friends of tho&s;e who were per&s;ecuted found no great difficulty in rendering the &s;cheme odious $o the na|tion. They even employed the pen of Fergu$on, who had been converned in every plot that was hatched &s;ince the Rye-hou&s;e con&s;piracy. This ve$eran, though appointed hou&s;e-keeper to the exci&s;e-office, thought him&s;elf poorly re|compen&s;ed for the part he had acted in the revolution, became di&s;&s;$t$$f$ed, and, upon this occa&s;ion, publi&s;hed a letter to Sir John T$e$chard, on the abu&s;e of power. It was repl$te with the mo&s;t bitter invectives again&s;t the mini&s;try, and contained a great number of $lagrant in&s;tances, in which the court had countenanced the vil$&s;t corruption, per&s;idy, and oppre$$ion. This production was in every body's hand, and had &s;uch an $ffect upon the people, that when the pri&s;oners were brought to trial at Manche&s;ter, the populace would have put the witne&s;&s;es to death, had not they been prevented by the interpo&s;ition of tho&s;e who were friends to the accu&s;ed per&s;ons, and had already taken e$$ectual mea&s;ures for their &s;afety. Lunt's chief a&s;&s;ociate in the my&s;tory of information was one Taaffe, a wretch of the mo&s;t profligate principles, who, finding him|&s;elf di&s;appointed in his hope of reward from the mini&s;try, was privat$ly gained over by the agents for the pri&s;oners. Lunt, when de&s;ired in court to point out the per&s;ons whom he had accu&s;ed, committed &s;uch a mi&s;take as greatly invali|dated his te&s;timony; and Taaffe declared before the bench, that the pretended plot was no other than a contrivance between him&s;elf and Lunt, in order to procure money from the government. The pri&s;oners were immediately ac|quitted, and the mini&s;try incurred a heavy load of popular odium, as the authors or abettors of knavi&s;h contrivances to en&s;nare the innocent. The go|vernment, with a view to evince their abhorrence of &s;uch practices, ordered the witne&s;&s;es to be pro&s;ecuted for a con&s;piracy again&s;t the lives and e$tates of the gentlemen who had been accu&s;ed; and at la&s;t the affair was brought into

the $word$ of commons. The Jacobites triumphed in their victory. They $word$ t$rned the $word$ of corruption upon the eviden$e for the crown, not $word$ mak$ng a con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion. B$t the cau&s;e was now debated b$fore $u$ges $ho were n$t all propitious to their views. The commons having $et on foot an inquiry$ and examined all the papers and circum&s;tances re$ating to the pre$ended plot, re&s;olved, That there was &s;ufficient ground for the pr$&s;ecution and trials of the gent$em$n at M$nche&s;ter; and that there was a dang$ro$s $$n&s;$iracy again&s;t the king and government. They i&s;&s;ued an order for taking Mr. Standi&s;h into cu&s;tody; and the me&s;&s;enger reporting that he was not to be found, they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring a procla|mation might be publi&s;hed, offering a reward for apprehending his per&s;on. The p$ers concurred with the commons in their &s;entiments of this affair; for complaints having been laid before their hou&s;e al&s;o, by the per&s;ons who thought them&s;elves aggrieved, the que&s;tion was put, Whether the government had cau&s;e to pro&s;ecute them$ and carried in the affir$ative; though a prote&s;t was entered again&s;t this vote by the earls of Roche&s;ter and Nottingham. Not|with&s;t$nding the&s;e deci&s;ions, the accu&s;ed gentlemen pro&s;ecuted Lunt and two of his accomplices for perjury, at the Lanca&s;ter a&s;&s;izes; and all three were &s;ound gu$lty. They were immediately indicted by the crown, for a con&s;piracy again&s;$ the lives and liberties of the per&s;ons they had accu&s;ed. The intention of the mini&s;try$ in laying this indictment, was to &s;eize the opportunity of pu|ni&s;hing &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es for the gentlemen, who had prevaricated in giving their t&s;timony$ but the de&s;ign being di&s;covered, the Lanca&s;hire-men refu&s;ed to produce their evidence again&s;t the informers: the pro&s;ecution dropped of con&s;equence, and the pri&s;oners were di&s;charged.</P>

The hou&s;e was immediately kindled into a flame by this information. The officers, and Pauncefort, agent for the regiment, were examined; and it was unani|mou&s;ly re&s;olved, That &s;uch a practice was arbitrary, illegal, and a violation of the rights and liberties of the &s;ubject. Upon further inquiry, Pauncefort and &s;ome other agents were committed to the cu&s;tody of the &s;erjeants, for having neglected to pay the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence-money they had received for the offi|cers and &s;oldiers. He was afterwards &s;ent to the Tower, together with Henry Guy, a member of the hou&s;e, and &s;ecretary to the trea&s;ury, the one for giving, and the other for receiving, a bribe to obtain the king's bounty. Pauncefort's brother was likewi&s;$ committed, for being concerned in the &s;ame commerce.

Then he and Hungerford were expelled the hou&s;e; while one Nois, a &s;ollicitor for the bill, was taken into cu&s;tody, becau&s;e he had &s;candalized the commons, in pretending he was engaged to give great &s;ums to &s;everal members, and denying this cir|cum&s;tance on his examination. The reformers in the hou&s;e naturally concluded<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1695.</NOTE> that the &s;ame arts had been practi&s;ed in obtaining the new charter of the Ea&s;t India company, which had been granted &s;o much again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of the na|tion. Their books were &s;ubjected to the &s;ame committee that carried on the former inquiry, and a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;cene of venality and corruption was &s;oon di&s;clo&s;ed. It appeared that the company, in the cou$$e of the preceding year, had payed near ninety$thou&s;and pounds in &s;ecret-&s;ervices; and that Sir Thomas Cooke, one of the directors, and a member of the hou&s;e, had been the chief manager of this infamous commerce. Cooke refu&s;ing to an&s;wer, was com|mitted to the Tower, and a bill of pains and penalties brought in, obliging him to di&s;cover how the &s;um mentioned in the report of the committee had been di&s;tributed. The bill was violently oppo&s;$d in the upper hou&s;e by the duke of Leeds, as being contrary to law and equity, and furni&s;hing a prece|dent of a dangerous nature. Cooke being, agreeably to his own petition, brought to the bar of the hou&s;e of lords, declared that he was ready and will|ing to make a full di&s;covery, in ca&s;e he might be favoured with an indemnify|ing vote, to &s;ecure him again&s;t all actions and &s;uits, except tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t India company, which he had never injured. The lords complied with his re|que&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed a bill for this purpo&s;e, to which the commons added a penal clau&s;e; and the former was laid a&s;ide.</P>

<P>When the king went to the hou&s;e to give the royal a&s;&s;ent to the money|bills, he endeavoured to di&s;courage this inquiry, by telling the parliament that the &s;ea&s;on of the year was far advanced, and the circum&s;tances of affairs ex|tremely pre&s;&s;ing: he therefore de&s;ired they would di&s;patch &s;uch affairs as they
<PB N="130" REF="1330">
&s;hould think of mo&s;t importance to the public, as he &s;hould put an end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion in a few days. No$with&s;tanding this &s;hameful interpo&s;ition, both hou&s;es appointed a joint committee to lay open the complicated &s;cheme of fraud and iniquity. Cooke on his fir&s;t examination confe&s;&s;ed$ that he had delivered ta$$ies for ten thou&s;and pounds to Francis Ty$$en deputy-governor, for the &s;pecial &s;ervice of the company; an equal &s;um to Richard Acton, for employ|ing his intere&s;t in preventing a new &s;ettlement, and endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h the old company, be&s;ides two thou&s;and pounds by way of intere&s;t, and as a further gratuity; a thou&s;and guineas to colonel Fitzpatrick, five hundred to Charles Bates, and three hundred and ten to Mr. Molineaux, a merchant, for the &s;ame purpo&s;es; and he owned that Sir Ba&s;il Firebrace had received forty thou&s;and pounds on various pretences. He &s;aid, he believed the ten thou&s;and pounds payed to Ty$$en had been delivered to the king by Sir Jo&s;iah Child, as a cu&s;tomary pre&s;ent which former kings had received: and that the &s;ums payed to Acton were di&s;tributed among &s;ome members of parliament. Fire$race being examined, affirmed that he had received the whole forty thou&s;and pounds for his own u&s;e and benefit; but that Bates had received &s;ums of money, which he under&s;tood were offered to &s;ome per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality. Acton declared, that ten thou&s;and pounds of the &s;um which he had received, was di&s;tributed among per&s;ons who had intere&s;t with members of parliament; and that great part of the money pa&s;&s;ed through the hands of Craggs, who was acquainted with &s;ome colonels in the hou&s;e, and northern members. Bates owned he had received the money, in consideration of u&s;ing his intere&s;t with the duke of Leeds in favour of the company: that this nobleman knew of the gratuity; and that the &s;um was reckoned by his grace's dome&s;tic, one Ro|bart, a foreigner, who kept it in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion until this inquiry was talked of, and then it was returned. In a word, it appeared by this man's te&s;timony, as well as by that of Firebrace on his &s;econd examination, that the duke of Leeds was not free from corruption; and that Sir John Trevor was a hireling pro&s;titute.</P>

<P>The report of the committee produced violent altercation, and the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;trictures upon the conduct of the lord pre&s;ident. At length the hou&s;e re&s;olved, That there was &s;ufficient matter to impeach Thomas duke of Leeds of high crimes and mi&s;demeanours; and that he &s;hould be impeached there|upon. Then it was ordered, That Mr. comptroller Wharton &s;hould impeach him before the lords, in the name of the hou&s;e, and of all the commons in England. The duke was actually in the middle of a &s;peech for his own ju&s;ti|fication, in which he a&s;&s;ured the hou&s;e, upon his honour, that he was not guilty of the corruptions laid to his charge, when one of his friends gave him intimation of the votes which had pa&s;&s;ed in the commons. He concluded his &s;peech abruptly, and repairing to the lower hou&s;e, de&s;ired he might be in|dulged with a hearing. He was accordingly admitted, with the compliment of a chair, and leave to be covered. After having &s;at a few minutes, he took off his hat, and addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the commons in very extraordinary terms. Having thanked them for the favour of indulging him with a hearing, he &s;aid the hou&s;e would not have been then $itting but for him. He prote&s;ted his own innocence, with re&s;pect to the crime laid to his charge. He complained that this was the effect of a de&s;ign which had been long formed again&s;t him. He
<PB N="131" REF="1340">
expre&s;&s;ed a deep &s;en&s;e of his being under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the parliament and nation, and demanded &s;peedy ju&s;tice. They forthwith drew up the articles of impeachment, which being exhibited at the ba$ of the upper hou&s;e, he pleaded Not guilty, and the commons promi&s;ed to make good their charge: but, by this time, &s;uch arts had been u&s;ed, as all at once checked the violence of the pro&s;ecution. Such a number of con&s;iderable per&s;ons were involved in this my&s;tery of corruption, that a full di&s;covery was dreaded by both parties. The duke &s;ent his dome&s;tic Rob$rt out of the kingdom, and his ab&s;ence furni&s;hed a pretence for po&s;tponing the trial. In a word, the inquiry was dropped; but the &s;candal &s;tuck fa&s;t to the duke's character.</P>

<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e deliberations, the king went to the hou&s;e on the third day of May, when he thanked the parliament for the &s;upplies they had granted; &s;ignified his intention of going abroad; a&s;&s;ured them he would place the admini&s;tration of affairs in per&s;ons of known care and fidelity$ and de&s;ired that the members of both hou&s;es would be more than ordinarily vigilant in pre&s;erving the public peace. Then the parliament was prorogued to the eighteenth of June <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the lords had enquired into the particulars of the Mediter|ranean expedition, and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, declaring, that the fleet in tho&s;e $e$s had conduced to the honour and advantage of the nation. On the other hand, the commons, in an addre&s;s, be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to take care that the kingdom might $e put on an equal foot|ing and proportion with the allies, in defraying the expence of the war.</P>
<P>The coin of the kingdom being greatly di|mini&s;hed and adulterated, the earls of Roche&s;ter and Nottingham expatiated upon this national evil in the hou&s;e of lords; and an act was pa&s;&s;ed, containing &s;everer penalties again&s;t clippers: but this produced no good effect. The value of the money $unk in the exchange to &s;uch a degree, that a guinea was reckoned adequate to thirty &s;hillings; and this public di&s;grace lowered the credit of the funds and of the government. The nation was alarmed by the circulation of fictiti|ous wealth, in&s;tead of gold and &s;ilver, &s;uch as bank-bills, exchequer-tallies, and government-&s;ecurities. The malcontents took this opportu|nity to exclaim again&s;t the bank, and even at|tempted to &s;hake the credit of it in parliament: but their endeavours proved abortive; the mo|$$ed-intere&s;t preponderated in both hou&s;es.</P></NOTE>. The king immediately appointed a regency to go|vern the kingdom in his ab&s;ence; but neither the prince&s;s of Denmark nor her hu&s;band was intru&s;ted with any &s;hare in the admini&s;tration; a circum&s;tance that evinced the king's jealou&s;y, and gave offence to a good part of the nation <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The regency was compo&s;ed of the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury; Somer$, lord-keeper of the great &s;eal; the earl of Pe$broke, lord privy-$eal; the duke of Devon&s;hire, lo$$$$eward of the hou&s;hold; the duke of Shrew&s;bury, &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate; the earl of Dor$$$, lo$d chamber|lain; and the lord Godolphi$, fir&s;t commi$$ione$ of the trea&s;ury.

<P>A &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was deemed nece&s;&s;ary in Scotland, to provide new &s;ub&s;idies for the maintenance of the troops of that kingdom, which had been &s;o &s;erviceable in the pro&s;ecution of the war. But, as a great outcry had been rai&s;ed again&s;t the government, on account of the ma$$acre of Glencoe, and the S$ots were tired of contributing towards the expence of a war from which they could derive no advantage, the mini&s;try thought proper to cajole them with the promi&s;e of &s;ome national indulgence. In the mean time, a
<PB N="132" REF="1350">
commi&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed the great &s;eal, for taking a precognition of the ma&s;&s;acre, as a previous &s;tep to the trial of the per&s;ons concerned in that perfidious tran&s;action. On the ninth of May, the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened by the marquis of Tweedale, ap|pointed commi&s;&s;ioner, who, after the king's letter had been read, expatiated on his maje&s;ty's care and concern for their &s;afety and welfare; and his firm purpo&s;e to maintain the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline in the church of Scotland. Then he pro|mi&s;ed, in the king's name, that if they &s;hould pa&s;s an act for e&s;tabli&s;hing a co|lony in Africa, America, or any other part of the world where a colony might be lawfully planted, his maje&s;ty would indulge them with &s;uch rights and pri|vileges as he had granted in like ca&s;es to the &s;ubjects of his other dominions. Finally, he exhorted them to con&s;ider ways and means to rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary &s;up|plies for maintaining their l$$d-forces, and for providing a competent number of &s;hips of war to protect their commence. The parliament immediately voted an addre&s;s of condolance to his maje&s;ty on the death of the queen; and they granted one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling for the &s;ervices of the en&s;uing year, to be rai&s;ed by a general poll tax, a land-tax, and an addi|tional excite.</P>

<P>Their next &s;tep was to de&s;ire the commi&s;&s;ioner would tran&s;mit their humble thanks to the king for his care to vindicate the honour of the govern|ment and the ju&s;tice of the nation, in ordering a precognition to be taken with re&s;pect to the &s;laughter of Glencoe. A motion was afterwards made, that the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould exhibit an account of their proceedings in this affair; and accordingly a report, con&s;i&s;ting of the king's in&s;tructions, Dalrymple's letters, the depo&s;itions of witne&s;&s;es, and the opinion of the committee, was laid before the parliament. The motion is &s;aid to have been privately influenced by &s;e|cretary John&s;ton, for the di&s;grace of Dalrymple, who was his rival in power and intere&s;t. The written opinion of the commi&s;&s;ioners, who were creatures of the court, imported. That Macdonald of Glencoe had been perfi|diou&s;ly murdered; that the king's intentions contained nothing to warrant the ma&s;&s;acre; and that the &s;ecretary D$lrymple had exceeded his orders. The parliament concurred with this report. They re&s;olved, That Living|&s;ton was not to blame, for having given the orders contained in his let|ters to lieutenant-colonel Hamilton: that this la&s;t was liable to pro&s;ecution: that the king &s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed to give orders, either for examining major Duncan&s;on in Flanders, touching his concern in this affair, or for &s;ending him home to be tried in Scotland; as al&s;o, that Campbel of Glenlyon, captain Drummond, lieutenant Lind&s;ey, en&s;ign Lundy, and &s;erjeant Barber, &s;hould be &s;ent to Scotland, and pro&s;ecuted according to law, for the parts they had acted in that execution. In con&s;equence of the&s;e re&s;olutions, the parliament drew up an addre&s;s to the king, in which they laid the whole blame of the ma&s;&s;acre upon the exce&s;s in the ma&s;ter of Stair's letters concerning that tran|&s;action. They begged that his maje&s;ty &s;hould give &s;uch orders about him, as he &s;hould think fit for the vindication of his government; that the actors in that barbarous &s;laughter might be pro&s;ecuted by the king's advocate, according to law; and that &s;ome reparation might be made to the men of Glencoe who e&s;caped the ma&s;&s;acre, for the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained in their effects upon that occa&s;ion, as their habitations had been plundered and burned, their lands wa&s;ted, and their cattle driven away; &s;o that they were reduced to extreme

poverty. Notwith&s;tanding this addre&s;s of the Scotti&s;h parliament, by which the king was &s;o &s;olemnly exculpated, his memory is &s;till loaded with the &s;u&s;picion of having concerted, countenanced, and enforced this barbarous execution, e&s;pecially as the ma&s;ter of Stair e&s;caped with impunity, and the other actors of the tragedy, far from being puni&s;hed, were preferred in the &s;ervice. While the commi&s;&s;ioners were employed in the inquiry, they ma$e &s;uch di&s;coveries concerning the conduct of the earl of Braidalbin as amounted to a charge of high-trea&s;on; and he was committed pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; but it &s;eems he had di&s;&s;embled with the Highlanders, by the king's permi&s;&s;ion, and now &s;heltered him&s;elf under the &s;hadow of a royal pardon.</P>

<P>The committee of trade, in pur&s;uance of the powers granted by the king to his commi&s;&s;ioner, prepared an act for e&s;tabli&s;hing a company trading to Africa and the Indies, impowering them to plant colonies, hold cities, towns or forts, in places uninhabited, or in others, with the con&s;ent of the natives; ve&s;ting them with an exclu&s;ive right, and an exemption for one and twenty years from all duties or impo&s;itions. This act was likewi&s;e confirmed by letters-patent under the great &s;eal, directed by the parliament, without any further warrant from the crown. Pater&s;on the projector had contrived the &s;cheme of a &s;ettle|ment upon the I&s;thmus of Darien, in &s;uch a manner as to carry on a trade in the South-&s;ea, as well as in the Atlantic, nay even to extend it as far as the Ea&s;t Indies; and a great number of London merchants, allured by the pro&s;pect of gain, were eager to engage in &s;uch a company, exempted from all manner of impo&s;ition and re&s;triction. The Scotti&s;h parliament likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed an act in favour of the epi&s;copal clergy, decreeing, That tho&s;e who &s;hould enter into &s;uch engagements to the king as were by law required, might continue in their benefices under his maje&s;ty's protection, without being &s;ubject to the power of pre&s;bytery. Seventy of the mo&s;t noted mini&s;ters of that per&s;ua&s;ion took the benefit of this indulgence. Another law was enacted for rai&s;ing nine thou&s;and men yearly, to recruit the Scotti&s;h regiments abroad; and an act for erecting a public bank: then the parliament was adjourned to the &s;eventh day of November.</P>

<P>Ireland began to be infected with the &s;ame factions which had broke out in England &s;ince the revolution. Lord Cap$l, the lord-deputy, governed in a very partial manner, oppre&s;&s;ing the Iri&s;h papi&s;ts, without any regard to equity or decorum. He undertook to model a parliament in &s;uch a manner, that they &s;hould comply with all the demands of the mini&s;try; and he &s;ucceeded in his endeavours, by making &s;uch arbitrary changes in offices as be&s;t &s;orted his purpo&s;e. The&s;e precautions being taken, he convoked a parliament for the twenty-&s;eventh day of Augu&s;t, when he opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, expatiating upon their obliga|tions to king William, and exhorting them to make &s;uitable returns to &s;uch a gra|cious &s;overeign. He ob&s;erved, that the revenue had fallen &s;hort of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment; to that both the civil and military lifts were greatly in debt: that his maje&s;ty had &s;ent over a bill for an additional exci&s;e, and expected they would find ways and means to an&s;wer the demands of the &s;ervice. They forth|with voted an addre&s;s of thanks, and re&s;olved to a&s;&s;i&s;t his maje&s;ty to the ut|mo&s;t of their power, again&s;t all his enemies foreign and dome&s;tic. They pa&s;&s;ed the bill for an additional exci&s;e, together with an act for taking away the writs "De here$ico comburendo;" another annulling all attainders and acts

pa&s;&s;ed in the late pretended parliament of king James: a third to prevent fo|reign education: a fourth for di&s;arming papi&s;ts: and a fifth for &s;ettling the e&s;tates of int$&s;tates. Then they re&s;olved, That a &s;um not exceeding one hun|dred and &s;ixty-three thou&s;and, three hundred and twenty-five pounds, &s;hould be granted to his maje&s;ty, to be rai&s;ed by a poll-bill, additional cu&s;toms, and a continuation of the additional exci&s;e. Sir Charles Porter, the chancellor, find|ing his importance dimini&s;hed, if not intirely de&s;troyed by the a&s;&s;uming di&s;po|&s;ition and power of the lord-deputy, began to court popularity, by e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of the Iri&s;h, again&s;t the &s;everity of the admini&s;tration; and actually formed a kind of Tory-intere&s;t which thwarted lord Capel in all his mea&s;ures. A motion was made in parliament to impeach the chancellor, for &s;owing di&s;|cord and divi&s;ion among his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects; but, being indulged with a hear|ing by the hou&s;e of commons, he ju&s;tified him&s;elf &s;o much to their &s;atisfaction, that he was voted clear of all imputation, by a great majority. Neverthele&s;s, they, at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ent over an addre&s;s, in which they bore te&s;ti|mony to the mild and ju&s;t admini&s;tration of their lord-deputy.</P>

<P>King William having taken &s;uch &s;teps as were deemed nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving the peace of England in his ab&s;ence, cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to Holland in the middle of May, fully determined to make &s;ome great effort in the Nether|lands, that might aggrandize his military character, and humble the power of France, which was already in the decline. That kingdom was actually exhau&s;ted in &s;uch a manner, that the haughty Lewis found him&s;elf obliged to &s;tand upon the defen&s;ive again&s;t enemies over whom he had been u&s;ed to triumph with uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s. He heard the clamours of his people, which he could not quiet; he &s;aw his advances to peace rejected; and to crown his misfor|tunes, he &s;u&s;tained an irreparable lo&s;s in the death of Francis de Montmorency, duke of Luxembourg, to who&s;e military talents he owed the greate&s;t part of his glory and &s;ucce&s;s. That great general died in January at Ver&s;ailles, in the &s;ixty-&s;eventh year of his age; and Lewis lamented his death the more deeply, as he had not another general left, in who&s;e under&s;tanding he could confide. The conduct of the army in Flanders was intru&s;ted to the marechal Villeroy; and Boufflers commanded a &s;eparate army, though &s;ubject to the other's orders. As the French king took it for granted, that the confederates would have a &s;uperiority of numbers in the field, and was well acquainted with the enter|pri&s;ing genius of their chief, he ordered a new line to be drawn between the Lys and the Scheld; a di&s;po&s;ition to be made for covering Dunkirk, Ypres, Tournay, and Namur; and layed injunctions on his general to act &s;olely on the defen&s;ive. Mean while, the confederates formed two armies in the Netherlands. The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy battalions of infantry, and eighty-two &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons, chiefly Engli&s;h and Scots, encamped at Aer&s;eele, Ca|neghem, and Wanterghem, between Theildt and Deyn&s;e, to be commanded by the king in per&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the old prince of Vaudemont. The other army, compo&s;ed of &s;ixteen battalions of foot, and one hundred and thirty &s;quadrons of hor&s;e, encamped at Zellich and Ham, on the road from Bru&s;&s;els to Dender|monde, under the command of the elector of Bavaria, &s;econded by the duke of Hol&s;tein-Ploen. Major-general Ellemberg was po&s;ted near Dixmuyde with twenty battalions and ten &s;quadrons; and another body of Brandenburg and Dutch troops, with a reinforcement from Liege, lay encamped on the Mehaigne,
<PB N="135" REF="1380">
under the conduct of the baron de Heyden, lieutenant-general of Bran|denburg, and the count de Berlo, general of the Liege cavalry. King Wil|liam arrived in the camp on the fifth day of July. After having remained eight days at Aer&s;eele, he marched to Becelair, while Villeroy retired behind his lines between Menin and Ypres, after having detached ten thou&s;and men to reinforce Boufflers, who had advanced to Pont-E&s;piere; but, he too retreated within his lines, when the elector of Bavaria pa&s;&s;ed the Scheld, and took po&s;t at Kirk|hoven: at the &s;ame time the body under Heyden advanced towards Namur.</P>

<P>The king of England having by his motions drawn the forces of the enemy on the &s;ide of Flanders, directed the baron de Heyden and the earl of Athlone, who commanded forty &s;quadrons from the camp of the elector of Bavaria, to inve&s;t Namur; and this &s;ervice was performed on the third day of July: but, as the place was not intirely &s;urrounded, marechal Boufflers threw him&s;elf into it, with &s;uch a reinforcement of dragoons as augmented the gar|ri&s;on to the number of fifteen thou&s;and cho&s;en men. King William and the elector brought up the re&s;t of the forces, which encamped on both &s;ides of the Sambre and the Maeze; and the lines of circumvallation were begun on the &s;ixth day of July, under the direction of the celebrated engineer general Coehorn. The place was formerly very &s;trong both by &s;ituation and art; but, the French, &s;ince its la&s;t reduction, had made &s;uch additional works, that both the town and citadel &s;eemed impregnable; and con&s;idering the number of the gar|ri&s;on, and the quality of the troops, commanded by a marechal of France, di&s;|tingui&s;hed by his valour and conduct, the enterprize was deemed an undeni|able proof of William's temerity. On the eleventh the trenches were opened, and next day the batteries began to play with incredible fury. The king re|ceiving intelligence of a motion made by a body of French troops, with a view to intercept the convoys, detached twenty &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons to ob&s;erve the enemy.</P>

<P>Prince Vaudemont, who was left at Rou&s;elaer with fifty battalions and the like number of &s;quadrons, under&s;tanding that Villeroy had pa&s;&s;ed the Lys, in order to attack him, took po&s;t with his left near Grammen, his right by Aer&s;eele and Caneghem; and began to fortify his camp with a view to ex|pect the enemy. Their vanguard appearing on the evening of the thirteenth at Dentreghem, he changed the di&s;po&s;ition of his camp, and intrenched him&s;elf on both &s;ides. Next day, however, perceiving Villeroy's de&s;ign was to &s;ur|round him, by means of another body of troops commanded by Mr. Montal, who had already pa&s;&s;ed the Thieldt for that purpo&s;e, he re&s;olved to avoid an engagement, and effected a retreat to Ghent, which is celebrated as one of the mo&s;t capital efforts of military conduct. He forth with detached twelve battali|ons and twelve pieces of cannon, to &s;ecure Newport, which Villeroy had intended to inve&s;t; but, that general now changed his re&s;olution, and undertook the &s;iege of Dixmuyde, garri&s;oned by eight battalions of foot and a regiment of dragoons, commanded by major-general Ellemberg, who in &s;ix and thirty hours after the trenches were opened, &s;urrendered him&s;elf and his &s;oldiers pri&s;oners of war. This &s;candalous example was followed by colonel Ofarrel, who yielded up Deyn&s;e on the &s;ame &s;hameful conditions, even before a battery wns opened by the be&s;iegers. In the &s;equel they were both tried for their mi&s;behaviour. El|lemberg &s;uffered death, and Ofarrel was broke with infamy. The prince of

$word$ &s;eat a me&s;&s;age to the French general, demanding the ga$ri&s;ons of tho&s;e two places, according to a cartel which had been &s;ettled between the powers at war; but, $o regard was payed to this remon&s;trance. Villeroy, after &s;everal marches and countermarches, appeared before Bru&s;&s;els, on the thirteenth day of Augu&s;t, and &s;ent a letter to the prince of Berghem, governor of that city, importing, that the king his ma&s;ter had ordered him to bombard the town, by way of making repri&s;als for the damage done by the Engli&s;h fleet to the maritime towns of France: he likewi&s;e de&s;ired to know, in what part the electre&s;s of Bavaria re&s;ided, that he might not fire into that quarter. After this declaration, which was no more than an unmeaning compliment, he began to bombard and cannonade the place with red hot bullets, which produced con&s;iagrations in many different parts of the city, and frightened the electre$s into a mi&s;carriage. On the fifteenth, the French di&s;continued their firing, and retired to Enghien.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the &s;iege of Namer was pro&s;ecuted with great ardour, under the eye of the king of England; while the garri&s;on de|fended the place with equal &s;pirit and per&s;everance. On the eighteenth day of July, major-general Ram&s;ay and the lord Cutts, at the head of five battalions, Engli&s;h, Scots, and Dutch, attacked the enemy's advanced works, on the right of the counter&s;carp. They were &s;u&s;tained by &s;ix Engli&s;h battalions, commanded by brigadier-general Fitzpatrick; while eight foreign regiments, with nine thou|&s;and pioneers, advanced on the left, under major-general Sali&s;ch. The a&s;&s;ault was de&s;perate and bloody, the enemy maintaining their ground for two hours with und$unted courage; but at la&s;t, they were obliged to give way, and were pur&s;ued to the very gates of the town, though not before they had killed or wounded twelve hundred men of the confederate army. The king was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the behaviour of the Briti&s;h troops, that during the action he layed his hand upon the &s;houlder of the elector of Bavaria, and exclaimed with emo|tion, "See my brave Engli&s;h!" On the twenty-&s;eventh, the Engli&s;h and Scots, under Ram&s;ay and Hamilton, a&s;&s;aulted the counter&s;carp, where they met with prodigious oppo&s;ition from the fire of the be&s;ieged. Neverthele&s;s, being &s;u&s;|tained by the Dutch, they made a lodgment on the foremo&s;t covered-way before the gate of St. Nicholas, as al&s;o upon part of the counterguard. The valour of the a&s;&s;ailants on this occa&s;ion was altogether unprecedented, and almo&s;t in|credible; while, on the other hand, the courage of the be&s;ieged was worthy of prai&s;e and admiration. Several per&s;ons were killed in the trenches at the &s;ide of the king, and among the&s;e Mr. Godfrey, deputy-governor of the bank of England, who had come to the camp to confer with his maje&s;ty about remitting money for the payment of the army. On the thirtieth day of July the elector of Bavaria attacked Vanbau's line that &s;urrounded the works of the ca&s;tle. Gene|ral Coehorn was pre&s;ent in this action, which was performed with equal va|lour and &s;ucce&s;s. They not only broke through the line, but even took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Coeborn's fort, in which, however, they found it impo&s;&s;ible to effect a lodgment. On the &s;econd day of Augu&s;t, lord Cutts, with four hundred Eng|li&s;h and Dutch grenadiers, attacked the &s;aillant-angle of a demi-ba&s;tion, and lodged him&s;elf on the &s;econd coun$er&s;carp. The breaches being now practica|ble, and preparations made for a general affault, count Gui&s;card, the governor, capitulated for the town on the fourth of Augu&s;t; and the French retired into
<PB N="137" REF="1400">
the citadel, again&s;t which twelve batteries played, upon the thirteenth. The trenches, mean while, were carried on with great expedition, notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of the be&s;ieged, who fired without cea&s;ing, and exerted amazing diligence and intrepidity in defending and repairing the damage they &s;u&s;tained. At length, the annoyance became &s;o dreadful from the unintermitting &s;howers of bombs and red hot bullets, that Boufflers, after having made divers furious &s;allies, formed a &s;cheme for breaking through the confederate camp with his cavalry. This, however, was prevented by the extreme vigilance of king William.</P>

<P>After the bombardment of Bru&s;&s;els, Villeroy being reinforced with all the troops that could be draughted from garri&s;ons, advanced towards Namur, with an army of ninety thou&s;and men; and prince Vaudemont being joined by the prince of He&s;&s;e, with a &s;trong body of forces from the Rhine, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong camp at Mazy, within five Engli&s;h miles of the be&s;ieg|ing army. The king, under&s;tanding that the enemy had reached Fleurus, where they di&s;charged ninety pieces of cannon, as a &s;ignal to inform the garri|&s;on of their approach, left the conduct of the &s;iege to the elector of Bavaria, and took upon him&s;elf the command of the covering-army, in order to oppo&s;e Villeroy, who being further reinforced by a detachment from Germany, de|clared, that he would hazard a battle for the relief of Namur. But, when he viewed the po&s;ture of the allies near Mazy, he changed his re&s;olution, and retired in the night without noi&s;e. On the thirtieth day of Augu&s;t, the be&s;ieged were &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, by count Horn, who, in a parley with the count de Lamont, general of the French infantry, gave him to under&s;tand, that the marechal Villeroy had retired towards the Mehaigne; &s;o that the garri&s;on could not expect to be relieved. No immediate an&s;wer being returned to this me&s;|&s;age, the parley was broke off; and the king re&s;olved to proceed without delay to a general a&s;&s;ault, which he had already planned with the elector and his other generals. Between one and two in the afternoon, lord Cutts, who de&s;ired the command, though it was not his turn of duty, ru&s;hed out of the trenches of the &s;econd line, at the head of three hundred grenadiers, to make a lodgment in the breach of Terra$nova, &s;upported by the regiments of Coulthorp, Buchan, Hamilton, and Mackay; while colonel Mar&s;elly, with a body of Dutch, the Bavarians, and Brandenburgers, attacked at two other places. The a&s;&s;ailants met with &s;uch a warm reception, that the Engli&s;h grenadiers were repul&s;ed even after they had mounted the breach, lord Cutts being for &s;ome time di&s;abled by a &s;hot in the head. Mar&s;elly was defeated, taken, and afterwards killed by a cannon ball from the batteries of the be&s;iegers. The Bavarians, by mi&s;taking their way, were expo&s;ed to a terrible fire, by which their general count Rivera and great number of their officers were &s;lain; neverthele&s;s, they fixed them|&s;elves on the outward intrenchment on the point of the Coehorn next to the Sambre, and maintained their ground with amazing fortitude. Lord Cutts, when his wound was dre&s;&s;ed, returned to the &s;cene of action; and ordered two hundred cho&s;en men of Mackay's regiment, commanded by lieutenant Cockle, to attack the face of the &s;aillant-angle next to the breach, &s;word in hand, while the en&s;igns of the &s;ame regiment &s;hould advance and plant their colours on the pali&s;adoes. Cockle and his detachment executed the command he had received with admirable intrepidity. They broke through the pali&s;adoes, drove the French from the covered way, made a lodgment in one of the batteries, and
<PB N="138" REF="1410">
turned the cannon again&s;t the enemy. The Bavarians being thus &s;u&s;tained, made their po&s;t good. The majors-general la Cave and Schwerin lodged them&s;elves at the &s;ame time on the covered-way; and although the general a&s;&s;ault did not &s;ucceed in its full extent, the confederates remained ma&s;ters of a very con&s;iderable lodgment, nearly an Engli&s;h mile in length. Yet this was dearly purcha&s;ed with the lives of two thou&s;and men, including many officers of great rank and reputation. During the action the elector of Bavaria &s;igna|lized his courage in a very remarkable manner, riding from place to place through the hotte&s;t of the fire, giving his directions with notable pre&s;ence of mind, according to the emergency of circum&s;tances, animating the officers with prai&s;e and promi&s;e of preferment, and di&s;tributing handfuls of gold among the private &s;oldiers.</P>

<P>On the fir&s;t day of September, the be&s;ieged having obtained a ce&s;&s;a|tion of arms that their dead might be buried, the count de Gui&s;card appear|ing on the breach, de&s;ired to &s;peak with the elector of Bavaria. His highne&s;s immediately mounting the breach, the French governor offered to &s;urrender the fort of Coehorn; but was given to under&s;tand, that if he intended to capitulate, he mu&s;t treat for the whole. This reply being communicated to Boufflers, he agreed to the propo&s;al: the ce&s;&s;ation was prolonged, and that very evening the capitulation was fini&s;hed. Villeroy, who lay encamped at Gemblours, was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of this event, by a triple di&s;charge of all the artillery, and a running fire along the lines of the confederate army, than he pa&s;&s;ed the Sambre near Charleroy, with great precipitation; and having reinforced the garri&s;on of Dinant, retreated towards the lines in the neighbourhood of Mons. On the fifth day of September, the French garri&s;on, which was now reduced from fifteen to five thou&s;and five hundred men, evacuated the citadel of Namur; and Boufflers was arre&s;ted in the name of his Britannick maje&s;ty, by way of repri&s;al for the garri&s;ons of Dixmuyde and Deyn&s;e, which the French king had detained contrary to the cartel &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two nations. The marechal was not a little di&s;compo&s;ed at this unexpected incident, and expo&s;tulated warmly with Mr. Dyckvelt, who a&s;&s;ured him the king of Great-Britain entertained a profound re&s;pect for his per&s;on and character; and offered to &s;et him at liberty, provided he would pa&s;s his word, that the garri&s;ons of Dixmuyde and Deyn&s;e &s;hould be &s;ent back, or that he him&s;elf would return in a fortnight. He &s;aid, that he could not enter into any &s;uch engagement, as he did not know his ma&s;ter's rea&s;ons for detaining the garri&s;ons in que&s;tion. He was therefore re|conveyed to Namur, from whence he was removed to Mae&s;tricht, and treated with great reverence and re&s;pect, till the return of an officer whom he had di&s;|patched to Ver&s;ailles with an account of his captivity. Then he engaged his word, that the garri&s;ons of Dixmuyde and Deyn&s;e &s;hould be &s;ent back to the allied army. He was immediately relea&s;ed, and conducted in &s;afety to Dinant. When he repaired to Ver&s;ailles, Lewis received him with very extraordinary marks of e&s;teem and affection. He embraced him in public with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of regard; declared him&s;elf perfectly well &s;atisfied with his conduct; created him duke and peer of France; and pre&s;ented him with a very large &s;um, in acknowledgment of his &s;ignal &s;ervices.</P>

<P>After the reduction of Namur, which greatly inhanced the military character of king William, he retired to his hou&s;e at Loo, which was his favourite
<PB N="139" REF="1420">
place of re&s;idence, leaving the command to the elector of Bavaria. About the latter end of September both armies began to &s;eparate. The French forces retired within their lines. A good number of the allied troops were di&s;tri|buted in different garri&s;ons; and a &s;trong detachment marched towards Newport, under the command of the prince of Wirtemberg, for the &s;ecurity of that place. Thus ended the campaign in the Netherlands. On the Rhine nothing of mo|ment was attempted by either army. The marechal de Lorges in the beginning of June pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Philip&s;burg; and po&s;ting him&s;elf at Bruck&s;al, &s;ent out parties to ravage the country. On the eleventh day of the month the prince of Baden joined the German army at Steppach, and on the eighth of July was reinforced by the troops of the other German confederates, in the neighbour|hood of Wi&s;elock. On the nineteenth, the French retired without noi&s;e, in the night, towards Manheim, where they repa&s;&s;ed the river without any interrup|tion from the Imperial general: then he &s;ent off a large detachment to Flan|ders. The &s;ame &s;tep was taken by the prince of Baden; and each army lay inac|tive in their quarters for the remaining part of the campaign. The command of the Germans in Hungary was conferred upon the elector of Saxony; but the court of Vienna was &s;o dilatory in their preparations, that he was not in a con|dition to act till the middle of Augu&s;t. Lord Paget had been &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador from England to the Ottoman Porte, with in&s;tructions relating to a pacification; but, before he could obtain an audience, the &s;ultan died, and was &s;ucceeded by his nephew Mu&s;tapha, who re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the war in per&s;on. The war-like genius of this new emperor afforded but an uncomfortable pro&s;pect to his people, con&s;idering that Peter, the czar of Mu&s;covy, had taken the opportunity of the war in Hungary, to invade the Crimea, and be&s;iege Azoph: &s;o that the Tartars were too much employed at home to &s;pare the &s;uccours which the &s;ultan demanded. Neverthele&s;s, Mu&s;tapha and his vizir took the field before the Im|periali&s;ts could commence the operations of the campaign, pa&s;&s;ed the Danube, took Lippa and Titul by a&s;&s;ault, &s;tormed the camp of general Veterani, who was po&s;ted at Lugos with &s;even thou&s;and men, and lo&s;t his life in the action. The infantry were cut in pieces, after having made a de&s;perate defence; but the hor&s;e retreated to Carou&s;ebes, under the conduct of general Tru&s;ches. The Turks after this exploit retired to Or&s;owa. Their navy, mean while, &s;urpri&s;ed the Venetian fleet at Scio, where &s;everal &s;hips of the republic were de&s;troyed, and they recovered that i&s;land, which the Venetians thought proper to abandon; but, in order to ballance this misfortune, the&s;e la&s;t obtained a complete victory over the ba&s;haw of Negropont, in the Morea.</P>

<P>The French king &s;till maintained a &s;ecret negotiation with the duke of Savoy, who&s;e conduct had been for &s;ome time my&s;terious and equivocal. Contrary to the opinion of his allies, he undertook the &s;iege of Ca&s;al, which was counted one of the &s;tronge&s;t fortifications in Europe, defended by a nume|rous garri&s;on, abundantly &s;upplied with ammunition and provi&s;ion. The &s;iege was begun about the middle of May; and the place was &s;urrendered by capitu|lation in about fourteen days, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the confederates, who did not know that this was a &s;acrifice by which the French court obtained the duke's forbearance during the remaining part of the campaign. The capitulation im|ported, That the place &s;hould be re&s;tored to the duke of Mantua, who was the rightful proprietor: That the fortifications &s;hould be demoli&s;hed at the expence
<PB N="140" REF="1430">
of the allies: that the garri&s;on &s;hould remain in the fort until that work &s;hould be completed; and ho&s;tages were exchanged for the performance of the&s;e con|ditions. The duke under&s;tood the art of procra&s;tination &s;o well, that Septem|ber was far advanced before the place was wholly di&s;mantled; and then he was &s;eized with an ague which obliged him to quit the army.</P>

<P>In Catalonia the French could hardly maintain the footing they had gained. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el, who wintered at Cadiz, was created admiral, chief|commander, and captain-general of all his maje&s;ty's &s;hips employed, or to be em|ployed in the Narrow &s;eas, and in the Mediterranean. He was reinforced by four thou&s;and five hundred &s;oldiers, under the command of brigadier-general Stewart; and &s;even thou&s;and men, Imperiali&s;ts as well as Spaniards, were draughted from Italy for the defence of Catalonia. The&s;e forces were tran&s;ported to Barcelona, under the convoy of admiral Nevil, detached by Ru&s;&s;el for that purpo&s;e. The affairs of Catalonia had already changed their a&s;pect. Several French parties had been defeated. The Spaniards had blocked up O&s;talric and Ca&s;tel-Follit: Noailles had been recalled, and the command devolved to the duke de Vendome, who no &s;ooner under&s;tood that the forces from Italy were landed, than he di&s;|mantled O&s;talric and Ca&s;tel-Follit, and retired to Palamos. The viceroy of Catalonia, and the Engli&s;h admiral having re&s;olved to give battle to the enemy, and reduce Palamos, the Engli&s;h troops were landed on the ninth day of Augu&s;t, and the allied army advanced to Palamos. The French appeared in order of bat|tle; but the viceroy declined an engagement. Far from attacking the enemy, he withdrew his forces, and the town was bombarded by the admiral. The mi&s;car|riage of this expedition was in a great mea&s;ure owing to a mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween Ru&s;&s;el and the court of Spain. The admiral complained, that his catho|lic maje&s;ty had made no preparations for the campaign: that he had neglected to fulfil his engagements with re&s;pect to the Spani&s;h &s;quadron, which ought to have joined the fleets of England and Holland: and, that he had taken no care to provide tents and provi&s;ion for the Briti&s;h forces. On the twenty-&s;eventh day of Augu&s;t he &s;ailed for the coa&s;t of Provence, where his fleet was endar|gered by a terrible tempe&s;t; then he &s;teered down the Streights, and towards the latter end of September arrived in the bay of Cadiz. Then he left a number of &s;hips under the command of Sir David Mitchel, until he &s;hould be joined by Sir George Rooke, who was expected from England, and returned home with the re&s;t of the combined &s;quadrons.</P>

<P>While admiral Ru&s;&s;el a&s;&s;erted the Briti&s;h dominion in the Mediter|ranean &s;ea, the French coa&s;ts were again in&s;ulted in the channel by a &s;eparate fleet, under the command of lord Berkely of Stratton, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Dutch admiral Allemonde. On the fourth day of July they anchored before St. Malo's, which they bombarded from nine ketches covered by &s;ome frigates, which &s;u&s;tained more damage than was done to the enemy. On the &s;ixth, Granville underwent the &s;ame fate; and then the fleet returned to Port&s;mouth. The bomb-ve&s;&s;els being refitted, the fleet &s;ailed round to the Downs, where four hundred &s;oldiers were embarked for an attempt upon Dunkirk, under the direction of Mee&s;ters, the famous Dutch engineer, who had prepared his infer|nals, and other machines for the &s;ervice. On the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t the expe|riment was tried without &s;ucce&s;s. The bombs did &s;ome execution; but, two &s;moke-&s;hips mi&s;carried, and the French had &s;ecured the Ri&s;bank and wooden
<PB N="141" REF="1440">
forts, with piles, booms, chains, and floating batteries, in &s;uch a manner, that the machine-ve&s;&s;els could not approach near enough to produce any effect. Be|&s;ides, the councils of the a&s;&s;ailants were di&s;tracted by violent animo&s;ities. The Engli&s;h officers hated Mee&s;ters, becau&s;e he was a Dutchman, and had acquired &s;ome credit with the king: he, on the other hand, treated them with di&s;re&s;pect. He retired with his machines in the night, and refu&s;ed to co-operate with lord Berkely in his de&s;ign upon Calais, which was now put in execution. On the &s;ixteenth he rought his batteries to bear upon this place, and &s;et fire to it in different quarters; but, the enemy had taken &s;uch precautions as rendered his &s;cheme abortive.</P>

<P>A &s;quadron had been &s;ent to the We&s;t-Indies under the joint-com|mand of captain Robert Wilmot and colonel Liling&s;ton, with twelve hundred land-forces. They had in&s;tructions to co-operate with the Spaniards in Hi&s;|paniola, again&s;t the French &s;ettlements on that i&s;land, and to de&s;troy their fi&s;h|eries on the banks of Newfoundland, in their return. They were accordingly joined by &s;eventeen hundred Spaniards rai&s;ed by the pre&s;ident of St. Domingo; but, in&s;tead of proceeding again&s;t Petit-Guavas, according to the directions they had received, Wilmot took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fort-Francois, and plundered the country for his own private advantage, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of Liling&s;ton, who prote&s;ted again&s;t his conduct. In a word, the &s;ea and land-officers lived in a &s;tate of perpetual di&s;&s;en&s;ion; and both became extremely di&s;agreeable to the Spaniards, who &s;oon renounced all connexion with them and their de&s;igns. In the beginning of September the commodore &s;et &s;ail for England, and lo&s;t one of his &s;hips in the gulph of Florida. He him&s;elf died in the pa&s;&s;age, and the greater part of the men being &s;wept off by an epidemical di&s;temper, the &s;quadron returned to Britain in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable condition. Not|with&s;tanding the great efforts the nation had made to maintain &s;uch a number of different &s;quadrons for the protection of commerce, as well as to annoy the enemy, the trade &s;uffered &s;everely from the French privateers, which &s;warmed in both channels, and made prize of many rich ve&s;&s;els. The marquis of Car|maerthen being &s;tationed with a &s;quadron off the Scilly i&s;lands, mi&s;took a fleet of merchant-&s;hips for the Bre&s;t-fleet, and retired with precipitation to Milford-Haven. In con&s;eqence of this retreat, the privateers took a good number of &s;hips from Barbadoes, and five from the Ea&s;t-Indies, valued at a million &s;terling. The merchants renewed their clamour again&s;t the commi&s;&s;ioners of the admi|ralty, who produced their orders and in&s;tructions in their own defence. The marquis of Carmaerthen had been guilty of flagrant mi&s;conduct on this occa|&s;ion; but, the chief &s;ource of tho&s;e national calamities was the circum&s;tantial intelligence tran&s;mitted to France from time to time, by the malcontents of England; for, they were actuated by a &s;candalous principle which they &s;till retain, namely, that of rejoicing in the di&s;tre&s;s of their country.</P>

<P>King William, after having conferred with the &s;tates of Holland, and the elector of Brandenburg, who met him at the Hague, embarked for England on the ninteenth day of October, and arrived in &s;afety at Margate, from whence he proceeded to London, where he was received as a conqueror, amid&s;t the rejoicings and acclamations of the people. On that &s;ame day he &s;um|moned a council at Ken&s;ington, in which it was determined to convoke a new parliament. While the nation was in good humour, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that they
<PB N="142" REF="1450">
would return &s;uch members only as were well affected to the government; whereas the pre&s;ent parliament might proceed in its inquiries into corruption and other grievances, and be the le&s;s influenced by the crown, as their depen|dance was of &s;uch &s;hort duration. The parliament was therefore di&s;&s;olved by proclamation, and a new one &s;ummoned to meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter on the twenty|&s;econd day of November. While the whole nation was occupied in the elec|tions, William, by the advice of his chief confidents, layed his own di&s;po&s;ition under re&s;traint, in another effort to acquire popularity. He honoured the di|ver&s;ions of Newmarket with his pre&s;ence, and there received a compliment of congratulation from the univer&s;ity of Cambridge. Then he vi&s;ited the earls of Sunderland, Northampton, and Montague, at their different hou&s;es in the country; and proceeded with a &s;plendid retinue to Lincoln, from whence he repaired to Welbeck, a &s;eat belonging to the duke of Newca&s;tle in Nottin|gham&s;hire, where he was attended by Dr. Sharp, archbi&s;hop of York, and his clergy. He lodged one night with lord Brooke at Warwick-ca&s;tle, dined with the duke of Shrew&s;bury at Eyefort, and, by the way of Wood&s;tock, made a &s;o|lemn entry into Oxford, having been met at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city by the duke of Ormond, as chancellor of the univer&s;ity, the vice-chancellor, the doctors in their habits, and the magi&s;trates in their formalities. He proceeded directly to the theatre, where he was welcomed in an elegant Latin &s;peech; and received from the chancellor on his knees, the u&s;ual pre&s;ents of a large Engli&s;h Bible, and book of Common-Prayer, the cuts of the univer&s;ity, and a pair of gold-fringe gloves. The conduits ran with wine, and a magnificent banquet was prepared; but, an anonymous letter being found in the &s;treet, importing, that there was a de&s;ign to poi&s;on his maje&s;ty, William refu&s;ed to eat or drink in Oxford, and retired immediately to Wind&s;or. Notwith&s;tanding this abrupt departure, which did not &s;avour much of magnanimity, the univer&s;ity cho&s;e Sir William Trumbal &s;ecretary of &s;tate, as one of their repre&s;entatives in par|liament.</P>

<P>The Whig-intere&s;t generally prevailed in the elections, though many even of that party were malcontents; and when the parliament met, Foley was again cho&s;en &s;peaker of the commons. The king in his fir&s;t &s;peech extolled the valour of the Engli&s;h forces; expre&s;&s;ed his concern at being obliged to demand &s;uch large &s;upplies from his people; ob&s;erved, that the funds had proved very deficient, and the civil li&s;t was in a precarious condition; recommended to their compa&s;&s;ion the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of the French prote&s;tants; took notice of the bad &s;tate of the coin; de&s;ired they would form a good bill for the encou|ragement and increa&s;e of &s;eamen; and contrive laws for the advancement of commerce. He mentioned the great preparations which the French were making for taking the field early; intreated them to u&s;e di&s;patch; expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at the choice which his people had made of their repre&s;entatives in the hou&s;e of commons; and exhorted them to proceed with temper and unani|mity. Though the two hou&s;es pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es of congratulation to the king, upon his late &s;ucce&s;s, and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in pro&s;ecuting the war with vigour, the nation loudly exclaimed again&s;t the intolerable burthens and lo&s;&s;es to which they were &s;ubjected, by a foreign &s;cheme of politics, which, like an unfathomable aby&s;s, &s;wallowed up the wealth and blood of the kingdom. All the king's endeavours to cover the di&s;gu&s;ting &s;ide of his character had
<PB N="143" REF="1460">
proved ineffectual: he was &s;till dry, re&s;erved, and forbidding; and the malcon|tents inveighed bitterly again&s;t his behaviour to the prince&s;s Anne of Den|mark. When the news of Namur's being reduced arrived in England, &s;he congratulated him upon his &s;ucce&s;s in a dutiful letter: to which he would not deign to &s;end a reply, either by writing or me&s;&s;age; nor had &s;he or her hu&s;|band been favoured with the &s;lighte&s;t mark of regard &s;ince his return to Eng|land. The members in the lower-hou&s;e, who had adopted oppo&s;ing maxims, either from principle or re&s;entment, relolved, That the crown &s;hould purcha&s;e the &s;upplies with &s;ome conce&s;&s;ion in favour of the people. They therefore brought in the &s;o long conte&s;ted bill for regulating trials in ca&s;es of high-trea|&s;on, and mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on; and, con&s;idering the critical juncture of affairs, the courtiers were afraid of ob&s;tructing &s;uch a popular mea&s;ure. The lords in&s;erted a clau&s;e, enacting, That a peer &s;hould be tried by the whole peerage; and the commons at once a&s;&s;ented to this amendment. The bill provided, That per&s;ons indicted for high-trea&s;on, or mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, &s;hould be furni&s;hed with a copy of the indictment five days before the trial; and indulged with coun&s;el to plead in their defence: That no per&s;on &s;hould be indicted but upon the oaths of two lawful witne&s;&s;es &s;wearing to overt-acts: That in two or more di&s;tinct trea&s;ons of divers kinds, alledged in one bill of indictment, one witne&s;s to one, and another witne&s;s to another, &s;hould not be deemed two witne&s;&s;es: That no per&s;on &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted for any &s;uch crime, unle&s;s the indictment be found within three years after the offence committed, except in ca&s;e of a de&s;ign or attempt to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate or poi&s;on the king, where this limi|tation &s;hould not take place: That per&s;ons indicted for trea&s;on, or mi&s;|pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, &s;hould be &s;upplied with copies of the panel of the jurors, two days at lea&s;t before the trial, and have proce&s;s to compel their witne&s;&s;es to appear: That no evidence &s;hould be admitted of any over-act not expre&s;ly laid in the indictment: That this act &s;hould not extend to any impeachment, or other proceedings in parliament; nor to any indictment for counterfeiting his maje&s;ty's coin, his great-&s;eal, privy-&s;eal, &s;ign-manual, or &s;ignet.</P>

<P>This important affair being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the commons proceeded to examine the accompts and e&s;timates, and voted above five millions for the &s;er|vice of the en&s;uing year. The &s;tate of the coin was by this time become &s;uch a national grievance as could not e&s;cape the attention of parliament. The lords prepared an addre&s;s to the throne, for a proclamation to put a &s;top to the currency of dimini&s;hed coin; and to this they de&s;ired the concurrence of the commons. The lower-hou&s;e, however, determined to take this affair under their own in&s;pection. They appointed a committee of the whole hou&s;e, to deliberate on the &s;tate of the nation with re&s;pect to the currency. Great op|po&s;ition was made to a recoinage, which was a mea&s;ure &s;trenuou&s;ly recom|mended and &s;upported by Mr. Montague, who acted on this occa&s;ion by the advice of the great mathematician Sir I&s;aac Newton. The enemies of this ex|pedient argued, that &s;hould the &s;ilver coin be called in, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to maintain the war abroad, or pro&s;ecute foreign trade, ina&s;much as the mer|chant could not pay his bills of exchange, nor the &s;oldier receive his &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence: that a &s;top would be put to all mutual payment; and this would pro|duce univer&s;al confu&s;ion and de&s;pair. Such a reformation could not be effected without &s;ome danger and difficulty; but it was become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as the evil daily encrea&s;ed, and in a little time mu&s;t have terminated in national
<PB N="144" REF="1470">
anarchy. After long and vehement debates, the majority re&s;olved to proceed with all po&s;&s;ible expedition to a new coinage. Another que&s;tion aro&s;e, Whether the new coin, in its different denominations, &s;hould retain the original weight and purity of the old; or the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;tandard be rai&s;ed in value? The famous Locke engaged in this di&s;pute again&s;t Mr. Lowndes, who propo&s;ed that the &s;tandard &s;hould be rai&s;ed; and his arguments were &s;o convincing, that the committee re&s;olved the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;tandard &s;hould be pre&s;erved with re|&s;pect to weight and finene&s;s. They likewi&s;e re&s;olved, That the lo&s;s ac|cruing to the revenue from clipped money, &s;hould be borne by the public. In order to prevent a total &s;tagnation, they further re&s;olved, That, after an ap|pointed day, no clipped money &s;hould pa&s;s in payment, except to the collectors of the revenue and taxes, or upon loans or payments into the exchequer: That, after another day to be appointed, no clipped money of any &s;ort &s;hould pa&s;s in any payment what&s;oever; and that a third day &s;hould be fixed for all per&s;ons to bring in their clipped money to be recoined, after which they &s;hould have no allowance upon what they might offer. They addre&s;&s;ed the king to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation agreeable to the&s;e re&s;olutions; and, on the nineteenth day of December, it was publi&s;hed accordingly. Such were the fears of the people, augmented and inflamed by the enemies of the government, that all payment immediately cea&s;ed, and a face of di&s;traction appeared through the whole community. The adver&s;aries of the bill &s;eized this opportunity to aggravate the apprehen&s;ions of the public. They inveighed again&s;t the mini&s;try, as the authors of this national grievance: they levelled their &s;atire particularly at Montague; and it required uncommon fortitude and addre&s;s to avert the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences of popular di&s;content. The hou&s;e of commons agreed to the following re&s;olutions, That twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be rai&s;ed by a duty on gla&s;s-windows, to make up the lo&s;s on the clipped money: That the recompence for &s;upplying the deficiency of clipped money &s;hould ex|tend to all &s;ilver coin, though of a coar&s;er alloy than the &s;tandard: That the collectors and receivers of his maje&s;ty's aids and revenues &s;hould be enjoined to receive all &s;uch monies: That a reward of five pounds per cent. &s;hould be given to all &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hould bring in either milled or broad unclipped money, to be applied in exchange of the clipped money throughout the king|dom: That a reward of three pence per ounce &s;hould be given to all per&s;ons who &s;hould bring in wrought plate to the mint to be coined: That per&s;ons might pay in their whole next year's land tax in clipped money, at one convenient time to be appointed for that purpo&s;e: That commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be appointed in every county to pay and di&s;tribute the milled and broad unclipped money, and the new coined money in lieu of that which was dimini&s;hed. A bill being prepared agreeable to the&s;e determinations, was &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of lords, who made &s;ome amendments, which the com|mons rejected: but, in order to avoid cavils and conferences, they dropped the bill, and brought in another, without the clau&s;es which the lords had in|&s;erted. They were again propo&s;ed in the upper-hou&s;e, and over-ruled by the majority; and, on the twenty-fir&s;t day of January, the bill received the royal a&s;&s;ent, together with another bill, enlarging the time for purcha&s;ing annuities, and continuing the duties on low wines. At the &s;ame time, the king pa&s;&s;ed the bill of trials for high trea&s;on, and an act to prevent mercenary elections. Divers merchants and traders petitioned the hou&s;e of commons, that the lo&s;&s;es
<PB N="145" REF="1480">
in their trade and payments, occa&s;ioned by the ri&s;e of guineas, might be taken into con&s;ideration. A bill was immediately brought in for taking off the obligation and encouragement for coining guineas, for a certain time: and then the commons proceeded to lower the value of this coin; a ta&s;k in which they m t with great oppo&s;ition from &s;ome members, who alledged that it would foment the popular di&s;turbances. At length, however, the majority agreed, that a guinea &s;hould be lowered from thirty to eight and twenty &s;hillings; afterwards to &s;ix and twenty; at length a clau&s;e was in&s;erted in the bill, for en|couraging people to bring plate to the mint, &s;ettling the price of a guinea at two and twenty &s;hillings, and it naturally &s;unk to its original value of twenty &s;hillings and &s;ixpence. Many per&s;ons, however, &s;uppo&s;ing that the price of gold would be rai&s;ed in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, hoarded up their guineas; and, upon the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ition, encouraged by the malcontents, the new coined &s;ilver-money was re&s;erved, to the great detriment of commerce. The king ordered mints to be erected in York, Bri&s;tol, Exeter, and Che&s;ter, for the purpo&s;e of the recoinage, which was executed with unexpected &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that, in le&s;s than a year, the currency of England, which had been the wor&s;t, became the be&s;t coin in Europe.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXV.</HEAD>
<P>At this period, the attention of the commons was diverted to an object of a more private nature. The earl of Portland, who enjoyed the greate&s;t &s;hare of the king's favour, had obtained a grant of &s;ome lord&s;hips in Derby&s;hire; and, while the warrant was depending, the gentlemen of that county re&s;olved to oppo&s;e it with all their power. In con&s;equence of a peti|tion, they were indulged with a hearing by the lords of the trea&s;ury. Sir William Williams, in the name of the re&s;t, alledged, that the lord&s;hips in que&s;tion were the antient deme&s;nes of the prince of Wales, ab&s;olutely unalien|able: that the revenues of tho&s;e lord&s;hips &s;upported the government of Wales in paying the judges and other &s;alaries: that the grant was of too large an ex|tent for any foreign &s;ubject: and that the people of the county were too great to be &s;ubject to any foreigner. Sundry other &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons were u&s;ed again&s;t the grant, which, notwith&s;tanding all their remon&s;trances, would have pa&s;&s;ed through the offices, had not the Wel&s;h gentlemen addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves by petition to the hou&s;e of commons. Upon this occa&s;ion, Mr. Price, a mem|ber of the hou&s;e, harrangued with great &s;everity again&s;t the Dutch in general, and did not even ab&s;tain from &s;arca&s;ms upon the king's per&s;on, title, and go|vernment. The objections &s;tarted by the petitioners being duly con&s;idered, were found &s;o rea&s;onable, that the commons pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, repre&s;enting, That tho&s;e manours had been u&s;ually annexed to the principality of Wales, and &s;ettled on the princes of Wales for their &s;upport: That many per&s;ons in tho&s;e parts held their e&s;tates by royal tenure, under great and valu|able compo&s;itions, rents, royal payments, and &s;ervices to the crown and princes of Wales, and enjoyed great privileges and advantages under &s;uch tenure. They therefore be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to recal the grant, which was in dimi|nution of the honour and intere&s;t of the crown; and prayed, that the &s;aid manours and lands might not be alienated without the con&s;ent of parliament. This addre&s;s met with a cold reception from the king, who promi&s;ed to recall the grant which had given &s;uch offence to the commons; and &s;aid he would find &s;ome other way of &s;hewing his favour to the earl of Portland.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The people in general entertained a national aver&s;ion to this nobleman; and the malcontents inculcated a notion that he made u&s;e of his intere&s;t and intelligence to injure the trade of England, that the commerce of his own country might flouri&s;h without competition. To his &s;ugge&s;tions they imputed the act and patent in favour of the Scotti&s;h company, which was &s;up|po&s;ed to have been thrown in as a bone of contention between the two king|doms. The &s;ubject was fir&s;t &s;tarted in the hou&s;e of lords, who invited the commons to a conference: a committee was appointed to examine into the particulars of the act for erecting the Scotti&s;h company; and the two hou&s;es pre&s;ented a joint addre&s;s again&s;t it, as a &s;cheme that would prejudice all the &s;ubjects concerned in the wealth and trade of the Engli&s;h nation. They repre&s;ented, that, in con&s;equence of the exemption from taxes, and other ad|vantages granted to the Scotti&s;h company, that kingdom would become a free port for all Ea&s;t and We&s;t India commodities; the Scots would be enabled to &s;upply all Europe at a cheaper rate than the Engli&s;h could afford to &s;ell their merchandi&s;e for; therefore England would lo&s;e the benefit of its foreign trade: be&s;ides, the Scots would &s;muggle their commodities into England, to the great detriment of his maje&s;ty and his cu&s;toms. To this remon&s;trance the king replied, That he had been ill &s;erved in Scotland, but that he hoped &s;ome re|medies would be found to prevent the inconveniencies of which they were ap|prehen&s;ive. In all probability he had been impo&s;ed upon by the mini&s;try of that kingdom; for, in a little time, he di&s;carded the marquis of Tweedale, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed both the Scotti&s;h &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, in lieu of whom he ap|pointed lord Murray, &s;on to the marquis of Athole. Notwith&s;tanding the king's an&s;wer, the committee proceeded on the inquiry, and, in con&s;equence of their report, confirming a petition from the Ea&s;t India company, the hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the directors of the Scotti&s;h company were guilty of a high crime and mi&s;demeanour, in admini&s;tering and taking an oath de fideli in this kingdom; and that they &s;hould be impeached for the &s;ame. Mean while, Ro|derick Mackenzie, from whom they had received their chief information, be|gan to retract his evidence, and was ordered into cu&s;tody: but he made his e&s;cape, and could not be retaken, although the king, at their reque&s;t, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation for that purpo&s;e. The Scots were extremely incen&s;ed again&s;t the king, when they under&s;tood he had di&s;owned their company, from which they had promi&s;ed them&s;elves &s;uch wealth and advantage. The &s;ettlement of Da|rien was already planned, and afterwards put in execution; though it mi&s;|carried in the &s;equel, and had like to have produced abundance of mi&s;chief.</P>

<DIV4 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The complaints of the Engli&s;h merchants who had &s;uffered by the war, was &s;o loud at this juncture, that the commons re&s;olved to take their ca&s;e into con&s;ideration. The hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee to con&s;ider the &s;tate of the nation with regard to commerce, and having duly weighed all circum&s;tances, agreed to the following re&s;olutions, That a council of trade &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of parliament, with powers to take mea&s;ures for the more effectual pre&s;ervations of commerce: That the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be nominated by parliament, but none of them have &s;eats in the hou&s;e: that they &s;hould take an oath, acknowledging the title of king William as rightful and lawful; and abjuring the preten&s;ions of James, or any other per&s;on. The king con&s;idered the&s;e re&s;olutions as an open attack upon
<PB N="147" REF="1500">
his prerogative, and &s;ignified his di&s;plea&s;ure to the earl of Sunderland, who patronized this mea&s;ure; but it was &s;o popular in the hou&s;e, that in all pro|bability it would have been put in execution, had not the attention of the com|mons been at this period diverted from it by the detection of a new con&s;piracy. The friends of king James had, upon the death of queen Mary, renewed their practices for effecting a re&s;toration of that monarch, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the intere&s;t of William was con&s;iderably weakened by the decea&s;e of his con|&s;ort. Certain individuals, who&s;e zeal for James over&s;hot their di&s;cretion, formed a de&s;ign to &s;eize the per&s;on of king William and convey him to France, or put him to death, in ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance. They had &s;ent emi&s;&s;aries to the court of St. Germains to demand a commi&s;&s;ion for this purpo&s;e, which was refu&s;ed. The earl of Ayle&s;bury, lord Montgomery, &s;on to the marquis of Powis, Sir John Fenwick, Sir John Friend, captain Charnock, captain Porter, and one Mr. Goodman, were the fir&s;t contrivers of this project. Charnock was detached with a propo&s;al to James, that he &s;hould procure a body of hor&s;e and foot from France, to make a de&s;cent in England, and they would engage not only to join him at his landing, but even to replace him on the throne of England. The&s;e offers being declined by James, on pretence that the French king could not &s;pare &s;uch a number of troops at that juncture, the earl of Ayle&s;bury went over in per&s;on, and was admitted to a conference with Lewis, in which the &s;cheme of an inva&s;ion was actually concerted. In the beginning of February, the duke of Berwick repaired privately to England, where he conferred with the con&s;pirators, a&s;&s;ured them that king James was ready to make a de&s;cent with a con&s;iderable number of French forces, di&s;tributed commi&s;&s;ions, and gave directions for providing men, arms, and hor&s;es, to join him at his arrival. When he returned to France, he found every thing pre|pared for the expedition. The troops were drawn down to the &s;ea-&s;ide; a great number of tran&s;ports were a&s;&s;embled at Dunkirk; Mon&s;ieur Gabaret had advanced as far as Calais with a &s;quadron of &s;hips, which, when joined by that of Du Bart at Dunkirk, was judged a &s;ufficient convoy; and James had come as far as Calais, in his way to embark. Mean while, the Jacobites in England were a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed in making preparations for a revolt. Sir John Friend had very near completed a regiment of hor&s;e. Con&s;iderable pro|gre&s;s was made in levying another by Sir William Perkins. Sir John Fen|wick had enli&s;ted four troops. Colonel Tempe&s;t had undertaken for one re|giment of dragoons; colonel Parker was preferred to the command of another; Mr. Curzon was commi&s;&s;ioned for a third; and the malcontents intended to rai&s;e a fourth in Suffolk, where their intere&s;t chiefly prevailed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>While one part of the Jacobites proceeded again&s;t William in the u&s;ual way of exciting an in&s;urrection, another, con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t de&s;perate con&s;pirators, had formed a &s;cheme of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Sir George Bar|clay, a native of Scotland, who had &s;erved as an officer in the army of James, a man of undaunted courage, a furious bigot in the religion of Rome, yet clo&s;e, circum&s;pect, and determined, was landed, with other officers, in Rom|ney-mar&s;h, by one captain Gill, about the beginning of January, and is &s;aid to have undertaken the ta&s;k of &s;eizing or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating king William. He imparted his de&s;ign to Harri&s;on, alias John&s;ton, a prie&s;t, Charnock, Porter, and Sir William Perkins, by whom it was approved; and pretended to have a particular commi&s;&s;ion for this &s;ervice. After various con&s;ultations, they re|&s;olved
<PB N="148" REF="1510">
to attack the king on his return from Richmond, where he commonly hunted on Saturdays; and the &s;cene of their ambu&s;$ade was a lane between Brentford and Turnham-green. As it would be nece&s;&s;ary to charge and di&s;|per&s;e the guards that attended the coach, they agreed that their number &s;hould be increa&s;ed to forty hor&s;emen, and each con&s;pirator began to engage proper per&s;ons for the enterpri&s;e. When their complement was full, they determined to ex$cute their purpo&s;e on the fifteenth day of February. They concerted the manner in which they &s;hould meet in &s;mall parties without &s;u&s;picion, and waited with impatience for the hour of action. In this interval, &s;ome of the underling actors, &s;eized with horror at the reflection of what they had under|taken, or captivated with the pro&s;pect of reward, re&s;olved to prevent the exe|cution of the de&s;ign by a timely di&s;covery. On the eleventh day of February, one Fi&s;her informed the earl of Portland of the &s;cheme, and named &s;ome of the con&s;pirat$rs; but his account was imperfect. On the thirteenth, however, he returned with a circum&s;tantial detail of all the particulars. Next day, the earl was acco&s;ted by one Pendergra&s;s, an Iri&s;h officer, who told his lord&s;hip he had ju&s;t come from Hamp&s;hire, at the reque&s;t of a particular friend, and under|&s;tood that he had been called up to town with a view of engaging him in a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;mate king William. He &s;aid, he had promi&s;ed to embark in the undertaking, though he dete&s;ted it in his own mind, and took this fir&s;t op|portunity of revealing the &s;ecret, which was of &s;uch con&s;equence to his ma|je&s;ty's life. He owned him&s;elf a roman catholic, but declared, that he did not think any religion could ju&s;tify &s;uch a treacherous purpo&s;e. At the &s;ame time he ob&s;erved, that as he lay under obligations to &s;ome of the con&s;pirators, his honour and gratitude would not permit him to accu&s;e them by name; and that he would upon no con&s;ideration appear as an evidence. The king had been &s;o much u&s;ed to $ictitious plots, and fal&s;e di&s;coveries, that he payed little regard to the&s;e informations, until they were confirmed by the te&s;timony of another con&s;pirator called La Rue, a Frenchman, who communicated the &s;ame particulars to brigadier Levi&s;on, without knowing the lea&s;t circum&s;tance of the other di&s;coveries. Then the king believed there was &s;omething real in the con&s;piracy; and Pendergra&s;s and La Rue were &s;everally examined in his pre|&s;ence. He thanked Pendergra&s;s in particular for this in&s;tance of his probity, but ob&s;erved, that it mu&s;t prove ineffectual, unle&s;s he would di&s;cover the names of the con&s;pirators; for, without knowing who they were, he &s;hould not be able to &s;ecure his life again&s;t their attempts. At length Pendergra&s;s was pre|vailed upon to give a li$t of tho&s;e he knew, yet not before the king had &s;o|lemnly promi&s;ed that he &s;hould not be u&s;ed as an evidence again&s;t them, but with his own con&s;ent. As the king did not go to Richmond on the day ap|pointed, the con&s;pirators po&s;tponed the execution of their de&s;ign till the Sa|turday following. They accordingly met at different hou&s;es on the Friday, when every man received his in&s;tructions. There they agreed, that after the per|petration of the parricide, they &s;hould ride in a body as far as Hammer&s;mith, and then di&s;per&s;ing, enter London by different avenues. But, on the morn|ing, when they under&s;tood that the guards were returned to their quarters, and the king's coaches &s;ent back to the Mews, they were &s;eized with a &s;udden damp, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that their plot was di&s;covered. Sir George Barclay withdrew him&s;elf, and every one began to think of providing for his own &s;afety. Next night, however, a good number of them was apprehended, and then
<PB N="149" REF="1520">
he whole di&s;covery was communicated to the privy-council. A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t tho&s;e that ab&s;conded; and great diligence was u&s;ed to find Sir George Barclay, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have a particular commi&s;&s;ion from James for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the prince of Orange; but, he made good his retreat, and it was never proved that any &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion had been granted.</P>

<P>This de&s;ign and the projected inva&s;ion proved equally abortive. James had &s;carce reached Calais, when the duke of Wirtemberg di&s;patched his aid-de camp from Flanders to king William, with an account of the purpo&s;ed de&s;cent. Expre&s;&s;es with the &s;ame tidings arrived from the elector of Bavaria and the prince de Vaudemont. Two con&s;iderable &s;quadrons being ready for &s;ea, admiral Ru&s;&s;el embarked at Spithead, and &s;tood over to the French coa&s;t with above fifty &s;ail of the line. The enemy were confounded at his appearance; they hauled in their ve&s;&s;els under the &s;hore, in &s;uch &s;hallow water that he could not follow and de&s;troy them, but he ab&s;olutely ruined their de&s;ign, by cooping them up in their harbours. King James, after having tarried &s;ome weeks at Calais, returned to St. Germains. The forces were &s;ent back to the garri&s;ons from which they had been draughted; and the people of France exclaimed, that the malignant &s;tar which ruled the de&s;tiny of James, had bla&s;ted this and every other project formed for his re&s;toration. By means of the reward offered in the proclamation, the greater part of the con&s;pirators were betrayed or taken. George Harris, who had been &s;ent from France, with orders to obey Sir George Barclay, &s;urrendered him&s;elf to Sir William Trumball, and confe&s;&s;ed the &s;cheme of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination in which he had been engaged. Porter and Pendergra&s;s were $p|prehended together. This la&s;t in&s;i&s;ted upon the king's promi&s;e, that he &s;hould not be compelled to give evidence; but, when Porter owned him&s;elf guilty, the other ob&s;erved, he was no longer bound to be &s;ilent, as his friend had made a confe&s;&s;ion; and they were both admitted as evidences for the crown.</P>

<P>After their examination, the king, in a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, com|municated the nature of the con&s;piracy again&s;t his life, as well as the advices he had received touching the inva&s;ion: he explained the &s;teps he had taken to defeat the double de&s;ign, and profe&s;&s;ed his confidence in their readine&s;s and zeal to concur with him in every thing that &s;hould appear nece&s;&s;ary for their common &s;afety. That &s;ame evening the two hou&s;es waited upon him at Ken|&s;ington, in a body, with an affectionate addre&s;s, by which they expre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of the villanous and barbarous de&s;ign which had been formed again&s;t his &s;acred per&s;on, of which they be&s;ought him to take more than ordi|nary care. They a&s;&s;ured him, they would to their utmo&s;t de&s;end his life, and &s;upport his government, again&s;t the late king James, and all other enemies; and declared, that in ca&s;e his maje&s;ty &s;hould come to a violent death, they would revenge it upon his adver&s;aries and their adherents. He was extre$ely well plea&s;ed with this warm addre&s;s, and a&s;&s;ured them, in his turn, he would take all opportunities of recommending him&s;elf to the continuance of their loyalty and affection. The commons forthwith impowered him by bill, to &s;ecure all per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of con&s;piring again&s;t his per&s;on and government. They brought in another, providing, That in ca&s;e of his maje&s;ty's death, the parliament then in being &s;hould continue until di&s;&s;olved by the next heir in $u$$e&s;&s;ion to the crown, e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of parliament: and, That if his ma|j$$$y &s;hould chance to die between two parliaments, that which had been la&s;t

$span$ and $it for the di&s;patch of national aff$$$$ They $word$ an $word$ to d$$ire. That his maje&s;ty would bani&s;h by procl$ma$$$n$ $ll papi&s;ts to the di&s;tance of ten miles from the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter$ and give i$&s;$ructions to the judges going on the circuits, to put the laws in execution again&s;t roman catholics and nonjurors. They drew up $word$ a&s;&s;ociation$ binding $$$m&s;elves to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in &s;upport of the king and his gover$ment$ and to revenge any violence that &s;hould be committed on his pe$&s;on. T$$$ was &s;$gned by all the members then pre&s;ent; but, as &s;ome had ab$$n$$d them&s;e;lves on frivolous pretences, the hou&s;e ordered, That in &s;ix|teen days the ab&s;entees &s;hould either &s;ub&s;cribe$ o$ declare their refu&s;al. Several members neglecting to comply with this injunction within the limited time, the &s;peaker was ordered to write to tho&s;e who were in the country, and demand a pere$$$tory an&s;wer, while the clerk of the hou&s;e attended &s;uch as pretended to be ill in town. The ab&s;entees finding them&s;elves pre&s;&s;ed in this manner, thought proper to &s;ail with the &s;tream, and &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociation, which was pre&s;ented to the king by the commons in a body, with a reque&s;t that it might be lodged among the records in the Tower, as a perpetual memorial of their loyalty and affection. The king received them with uncommon complacency; declared, that he heartily entered into the &s;ame a&s;&s;ociation; that he &s;hould be always ready to venture his life with his good &s;ubjects, again&s;t all who &s;hould endea|vour to &s;ubvert the religion, laws, and liberties of England; and he promi&s;ed, that this, and all other a&s;&s;ociations &s;hould be lodged among the records in the Tower of London. Next day the commons re&s;olved, That whoever &s;hould affirm an a&s;&s;ociation was illegal, &s;hould be deemed a promoter of the de&s;igns of the late king James, and an enemy to the laws and liberties of the kingdom. The lords followed the example of the lower hou&s;e in drawing up an a&s;&s;ociation; but, the earls of Nottingham, Sir Edward Seymour, and Mr. Finch, objected to the words$ Rightful, and Lawful, as applied to his maje&s;ty. They &s;aid, as the crown and its prerogatives were ve&s;ted in him, they would yield obedience, though they could not acknowledge him as their rightful and lawful king. No|thing could be more ab&s;ured than this di&s;tinction &s;tarted by men who had actually con&s;tituted part of the admini&s;tration; unle&s;s they &s;uppo&s;ed that the right of king William expired with queen Mary. The earl of Roche&s;ter propo&s;ed an expedient in favour of &s;uch tender con&s;ciences, by altering the words that gave offence; and this was adopted accordingly. Fifteen of the peers, and ninety|two commoners &s;igned the a&s;&s;ociation with reluctance. It was, however, &s;ub&s;cribed by all &s;orts of people in different parts of the kingdom; and the bi|&s;hops<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burner. Oldm$$on. Boyer. Tindal. Ralph. L$ves of the Admirals.</NOTE> drew up a form for the clergy, which was &s;igned by a great majority. The commons brought in a bill, declaring all men incapable of public tru&s;t, or of &s;itting in parliament, who would not engage in this a&s;&s;ociation. At the &s;ame time, the council i&s;&s;ued an order for renewing all the commi&s;&s;ions in Eng+land, that tho&s;e who had not &s;igned it voluntarily &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice as di&s;affected per&s;ons.</P>

<P>After the&s;e warm demon&s;trations of loyalty, the commons pro|ceeded upon ways and means for rai&s;ing the &s;upplies. A new bank was con|&s;tituted as a fund, upon which the &s;um of two millions, five hundred and &s;ixty|four thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be rai&s;ed; and it was called the Land-bank, be|cau&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed on land &s;ecurities. This &s;cheme, &s;aid to have been projected
<PB N="151" REF="1540">
by the famous doctor Chamberlain, was patronized by the earl of Sunderland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1696.</NOTE> and managed by Foley and Harley: &s;o that it &s;eemed to be a Tory plan, which Sunderland &s;upported, in order to reconcile him&s;elf to that party. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The commons re&s;olved, That a fund re|deemable by parliament be &s;ettled in a nati|onal land-bank, to be rai&s;ed by new &s;ub&s;crip|tions: That no per&s;on be concerned in both banks at the &s;ame time: That the duties upon coals, culm, and tonnage of &s;hips, be taken off, from the &s;eventeenth day of March: That the &s;um of two millions, five hundred and &s;ixty-four thou&s;and pounds, be rai&s;ed on this perpetual fund, redeemable by parliament: That the new bank &s;hould be re&s;trained from lending money but upon land-&s;ecurities, or to the government in the exchequer: That for making up the fund of intere&s;t for the capital &s;tock, certain duties upon gla&s;s-wares, &s;tone, and earthen bottles, granted before to the king for a term of years, be continued to his maje&s;ty, his heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: That a further duty be layed upon &s;tone and earthen ware, and another upon tobacco-pipes. This bank was to lend out five hundred thou&s;and pounds a-year upon land &s;ecurities, at three pounds and ten &s;hillings per cent. per annum, and to cea&s;e and determine, unle&s;s the &s;ub&s;cription &s;hould be full by the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t next en&s;uing.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable laws enacted in this &s;e&s;|&s;ion were the&s;e: An act for voiding all the elec|tions of parliament-men, at which the elected had been at any expence in meat, drink, or mo|ney, to procure votes. Another again&s;t unlaw|ful and double returns. A third, for the more ea&s;y recovery of &s;mall tythes. A fourth, to pre|vent marriages, without licen&s;e or banes. A fifth, for enabling the inhabitants of Wales to di&s;po&s;e of all their per&s;onal e&s;tates as they &s;hould think $it. This law was in bar of a cu&s;tom that had pre|vailed in that country. The widows and younger children claimed a &s;hare of the effects, called their Rea&s;onable part, although the effects had been otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of by will or deed. The par|liament likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed an act, for preventing the exportation of wool, and encourage the impor|tation thereof from Ireland. An act for encouraging the linen manufactures of Ireland. An act for regu|lating juries. An act for encouraging the Green|land trade. An act of indulgence to the quakers$ that their &s;olemn affirmation &s;hould be accepted in&s;tead of an oath. and, An Act for continuing certain other acts that were near expiring. An|other bill had pa&s;&s;ed, for the better regulating elections for members of parliament; but, the royal a&s;&s;ent was denied. The que&s;tion was put in the hou&s;e of commons, That who&s;oever ad|vi&s;ed his maje&s;ty not to give his a&s;&s;ent to that bill, was an enemy to his country; but, it was rejected by a great majority.</P></NOTE> The bank of England petitioned again&s;t this bill, and were heard by their coun&s;el; but, their repre&s;entations produced no other effect, and the bill having pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, received the royal a&s;&s;ent. On the twenty-&s;eventh day of April the king clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;hort but gracious &s;peech; and the parliament was prorogued to the &s;ixteenth day of June.</P>

<P>Before this period &s;ome of the con&s;pirators had been brought to trial. The fir&s;t who &s;uffered was Robert Charnock, one of the two fellows of Magdalen-college, who in the reign of James had renounced the prote&s;tant re|ligion, lieutenant King, and Thomas Keys, who had been formerly a trum|peter, but of late &s;ervant to captain Porter. They were found guilty of high|trea&s;on, and executed at Tyburn. They delivered papers to the &s;heriff, in which they &s;olemnly declared, that they had never &s;een or heard of any commi&s;&s;ion from king James for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the prince of Orange: Charnock in particu|lar ob&s;erved, that he had received frequent a&s;&s;urances of the king'shaving rejected &s;uch propo&s;als when they had been offered; and that there was no other com|mi&s;&s;ion but that for levying war in the u&s;ual form. Sir John Friend and Sir William Perkins were tried in April. The fir&s;t from mean beginnings had acquired great wealth and credit, and always firmly adhered to the intere&s;ts of king James. The other was likewi&s;e a man of fortune, violently attached to the &s;ame principles, though he had taken the oaths to the pre&s;ent go|vernment, as one of the &s;ix clerks in chancery. Porter and Blair another evidence, depo&s;ed, that Sir John Friend had been concerned in levying men under a commi&s;&s;ion from king James; and, that he knew of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination$
<PB N="152" REF="1550">
plot, though not engaged in it as a per&s;onal actor. He endeavoured to invali|date the te&s;timony of Blair, by proving him guilty of the mo&s;t &s;hocking ingra|titude. He ob&s;erved, that both the evidences were reputed papi&s;ts. The cu|rate of Hackney, who officiated as chaplain in the pri&s;oner's hou&s;e, declared upon oath, that after the revolution he u&s;ed to pray for king William; and, that he had often heard Sir John Friend &s;ay, that though he could not comply with the pre&s;ent government, he would live peaceably under it, and never en|gage in any con&s;piracy. Mr. Hoadley, father of the pre&s;ent bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, added, that the pri&s;oner was a good prote&s;tant, and frequently expre&s;&s;ed his dete&s;tation of king-killing principles. Friend him&s;elf owned, he had been with &s;ome of the con&s;pirators at a meeting in Leadenhall-&s;treet, but heard nothing of rai&s;ing men, or any de&s;ign again&s;t the government. He likewi&s;e affirmed, that a con&s;ultation to levy war was not trea&s;on; and, that his being at a trea&s;onable con&s;ult, could amount to no more than a mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on. Lord-chief-ju&s;tice Holt declared, that although a bare con&s;piracy or de&s;ign to levy war, was not trea&s;on within the &s;tatute of Edward III. yet, if the de&s;ign or con&s;piracy be to kill, or depo&s;e, or impri&s;on the king, by the means of levying war, then the con&s;ultation and con&s;piracy to levy war becomes high-trea&s;on, though no war be actually levied. The &s;ame inference might have been drawn again&s;t the authors and in&s;truments of the revolution. The judge's explanation influenced the jury, who after &s;ome deliberation found the pri&s;oner guilty. Next day Sir William Perkins was brought to the bar, and upon the te&s;timony of Porter, Ewebank his own groom, and Haywood, a notorious informer, con|victed of having been concerned, not only in the inva&s;ion, but al&s;o in the de|&s;ign again&s;t the king's life. The evidence was &s;canty, and the pri&s;oner having been bred to the law, made an artful and vigorous defence; but, the judge acted as coun&s;el for the crown, and the jury, by the hints they received from the bench. He and Sir John Friend underwent the &s;entence of death, and &s;uffered at Tyburn on the third day of April. Friend prote&s;ted before God, that he knew of no immediate de&s;cent purpo&s;ed by king James, and therefore had made no preparations: that he was utterly ignorant of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination-&s;cheme: that he died in the communion of the church of England, and layed down his life chearfully in the cau&s;e for which he &s;uffered. Perkins declared, upon the word of a dying man, that the tenour of the king's commi&s;&s;ion which he &s;aw, was general, directed to all his loving &s;ubjects, to rai&s;e and levy war again&s;t the prince of Orange and his adherents, and to &s;eize all forts, ca&s;tles, &amp;c. but that he neither &s;aw, nor heard of any commi&s;&s;ion particularly levelled again&s;t the per&s;on of the prince of Orange. He owned, however, that he was privy to the de&s;ign; but believed it was known to few or none but the immediate under|takers. The&s;e two criminals were in their la&s;t moments attended, by Collier, Snatt, and Cook, three nonjuring clergymen, who ab&s;olved them in the view of the populace, with an impo&s;ition of hands: a public in&s;ult on the government which did not pa&s;s unnoticed. Tho&s;e three clergymen were pre&s;ented by the grand-jury, for having countenanced the trea&s;on by ab&s;olving the traitors, and thereby encouraged other per&s;ons to di&s;turb the peace of the kingdom. An indictment being preferred again&s;t them, Cook and Snatt were committed to Newgate; but, Collier ab&s;conded, and publi&s;hed a vindication of their con|duct, in which he affirmed, that the impo&s;ition of hands was the general practice
<PB N="153" REF="1560">
of the primitive church. On the other hand, the two metropolitans, and twelve other bi&s;hops, &s;ub&s;cribed a declaration, condemning the admini&s;tration of ab&s;olution without a previous confe&s;&s;ion made, and abhorrence expre&s;&s;ed by the pri&s;oners of the heinous crimes for which they &s;uffered. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ame month, Rookwood, Cranborne, and Lowick, were tried as con&s;pira|tors, by a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion, in the king's bench; and convicted on the joint|te&s;timony of Porter, Harris, La Rue, Bertram, Fi&s;her, and Pendergra&s;s. Some favourable circum&s;tances appeared in the ca&s;e of Lowick. The proof of his having been concerned in the de&s;ign again&s;t the king's life was very de|fective: many per&s;ons of reputation declared, he was an hone&s;t good-natured, inoffen&s;ive man; and, he him&s;elf concluded his defence with the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tation of his own innocence. Great interce&s;&s;ion was made for his pardon by &s;ome noblemen; but, all their intere&s;t proved ineffectual. Cranborne died in a tran&s;port of indignation, leaving a paper, which the government thought proper to &s;uppre&s;s. Lowick and Rookwood likewi&s;e delivered declarations to the &s;heriff, the contents of which, as being le&s;s inflammatory, were allowed to be publi&s;hed. Both &s;olemnly denied any knowledge of a commi&s;&s;ion from king James, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the prince of Orange: the one affirming, that he was incapable of granting &s;uch an order; and the other a&s;&s;erting, that he, the be&s;t of kings, had often rejected propo&s;als of that nature. Lowick owned that he would have joined the king at his landing; but declared, he had never been concerned in any bloody affair during the whole cour&s;e of his life. On the con|trary, he &s;aid, he had endeavoured to prevent blood&s;hed as much as lay in his power; and that he would not kill the mo&s;t mi&s;erable creature in the world, even though &s;uch an act would &s;ave his life, re&s;tore his &s;overeign, and make him one of the greate&s;t men in England. Rookwood alledged, he was engaged by his immediate commander, whom he thought it was his duty to obey, though the &s;ervice was much again&s;t his judgment and inclination. He profe&s;&s;ed his abhorrence of treachery even to an enemy. He forgave all mankind, even the prince of Orange, who, as a &s;oldier, he &s;aid, ought to have con&s;idered his ca&s;e before he &s;igned his death-warrant: he prayed God would open his eyes, and render him &s;en&s;ible of the blood that was from all parts crying again&s;t him, &s;o as he might avert a heavier execution than that which he now ordered to be inflicted. The next per&s;on brought to trial was Mr. Cooke, &s;on of Sir Miles Cooke, one of the &s;ix clerks in chancery. Porter and Goodman depo&s;ed, that he had been pre&s;ent at two meetings in the King's-head-tavern in Leadenhall-&s;treet, with the lords Ayle&s;bury and Montgomery, Sir William Perkins, Sir John Fenwick, Sir John Friend, Charnock, and Porter. The evidence of Goodman was invalidated by the te&s;timony of the landlord and two drawers belonging to the tavern, who &s;wore, that Goodman was not there while the noblemen were pre&s;ent. The pri&s;oner him&s;elf &s;olemnly prote&s;ted that he was ever aver&s;e to the introduction of foreign forces: that he did not &s;o much as hear of the intended inva&s;ion, until it became the common topic of conver&s;ation: and, that he had never &s;een Goodman at the King's-head. He declared his intention of receiving the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament, and wi&s;hed he might peri&s;h in the in&s;tant, if he now &s;poke untruth. No re&s;pect was payed to the&s;e a&s;&s;everations. The &s;ol|licitor-general Hawles, and the lord chief-ju&s;tice Treby, treated him with great &s;everity in the pro&s;ecution and charge to the jury, by whom he was capitally
<PB N="154" REF="1570">
convicted. After his condemnation the court-agents tampered with him to make further di&s;coveries; and after his fate had been protracted by divers &s;hort reprieves, he was &s;ent into bani&s;hment. From the whole tenour of the&s;e di&s;|coveries and proceedings, it appears, that James had actually meditated an in|va&s;ion: that his parti&s;ans in England had made preparations for joining him at his arrival: that a few de&s;peradoes of that faction had concerted a &s;cheme again&s;t the life of king William: that in pro&s;ecuting the con&s;pirators the court had countenanced informers, the judges had &s;trained the law, wre&s;ted circum|&s;tances, and even deviated from the function of their office, to convict the pri&s;on|ers: in a word, that the admini&s;tration had u&s;ed the &s;ame arbitrary and unfair practices again&s;t tho&s;e unhappy people, which they them&s;elves had in the late reigns numbered among the grievances of the kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>The warmth, however, manife&s;ted on this occa&s;ion, may have been owing to national re&s;entment of the purpo&s;ed inva&s;ion. Certain it is, the two hou&s;es of parliament, and the people in general, were animated with extraordinary indignation again&s;t France at this juncture. The lords be&s;ought his maje&s;ty, in a &s;olemn addre&s;s, to appoint a day of thank&s;giving to almighty God, for having defeated the barbarous purpo&s;e of his enemies; and this was ob&s;erved with uncommon zeal and devotion. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el leaving a &s;qua|dron for ob&s;ervation on the French coa&s;t, returned to the Downs; but, Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel being properly prepared for the expedition, &s;ubjected Calais to another bombardment, by which the town was &s;et on fire in different parts, and the inhabitants were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation. The generals of the allied army in Flanders re&s;olved to make &s;ome immediate retaliation upon the French for their unmanly de&s;ign upon the life of king William, as they took it for granted that Lewis was acce&s;&s;ory to the &s;cheme of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. That mo|narch, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that a powerful diver&s;ion would be made by the de|&s;cent on England, had e&s;tabli&s;hed a va&s;t magazine at Givet, de&s;igning, when the allies &s;hould be enfeebled by the ab&s;ence of the Briti&s;h troops, to &s;trike &s;ome &s;troke of importance early in the campaign. On this the confederates now de|termined to wreak their vengeance. In the beginning of March the earl of Ath|lone and mon&s;ieur de Coehorn, with the concurrence of the duke of Hol&s;tein-Ploen, who commanded the allies, &s;ent a &s;trong detachment of hor&s;e, draughted from Bru&s;&s;els and the neighbouring garri&s;ons, to amu&s;e the enemy on the &s;ide of Charleroy; while they a&s;&s;embled forty &s;quadrons, thirty battalions, with fifteen pieces of cannon, and &s;ix mortars, in the territory of Namur. Athlone with part of this body inve&s;ted Dinant, while Coehorn with the remainder ad|vanced to Givet. He forthwith began to batter and bombard the place, which in three hours was on fire, and by four in the afternoon wholly de&s;troyed, with the great magazine it contained. Then the two generals joining their forces, returned to Namur without interruption. Hitherto the republic of Venice had deferred acknowleging king William; but now they &s;ent an extraordinary em|ba&s;&s;y for that purpo&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;igniors Soranzo and Venier, who arrived in London, and on the fir&s;t day of May had a public audience. The king on this occa&s;ion knighted Soranzo as the &s;enior amba&s;&s;ador, and pre&s;ented him with the &s;word, according to cu&s;tom. On that day too, William declared in council, that he had appointed the &s;ame regency which had governed the kingdom during his la&s;t ab&s;ence; and embarking on the &s;eventh at Margate, arrived at Orange-Polder

<P>The French had taken the field before the allied army could be a&s;&s;embled; but no tran&s;action of con&s;equence di&s;tingui&s;hed this campaign, either upon the Rhine or in Flanders. The &s;cheme of Lewis was &s;till defen&s;ive on the &s;ide of the Netherlands, while the active plans of king William were de|feated by want of money. All the funds for this year proved defective; the land-bank failed, and the national bank &s;u&s;tained a rude &s;hock in its credit. The lo&s;s of the nation upon the recoinage amounted to two millions, two hun|dred thou&s;and pounds: and though the different mints were employed without interruption, they could not for &s;ome months &s;upply the circulation, e&s;pecially as great part of the new money was kept up by tho&s;e who received it in payment, or di&s;po&s;ed of, at an unrea&s;onable advantage. The French king having ex|hau&s;ted the wealth and patience of his &s;ubjects, and greatly dimini&s;hed their number in the cour&s;e of this war, began to be diffident of his arms, and em|ployed all the arts of private negotiation. While his mini&s;ter D'Avauux pre&s;&s;ed the king of Sweden to offer his medlation, he &s;ent Callieres to Holland with propo&s;als for &s;ettling the preliminaries of a treaty. He took it for granted, that as the Dutch were a trading people, who&s;e commerce had greatly &s;uffered in the war, they could not be aver&s;e to a pacification; and he in&s;tructed his emi&s;&s;aries to tamper with the malcontents of the republic, e&s;pecially with the remains of the Louve&s;tein faction, which had always oppo&s;ed the &s;chemes of the &s;tadtholder. Callieres met with a favourable reception from the &s;tates, which began to treat with him about the preliminaries, though not without the con&s;ent and concurrence of king William and the re&s;t of the allies. Lewis, with a view to quicken the effect of this negotiation, pur&s;ued offen&s;ive mea&s;ures in Catalonia, where his general, the duke de Vendome attacked and wor&s;ted the Spaniards in their camp near Oftalric, tho' the action was not deci&s;ive; for he was obliged to retreat, after having made vigorous efforts again&s;t their intrench|ments. On the twentieth day of June the marechal de Lorges pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Philip&s;burgh, and encamped within a league of Eppingen, where the Impe|rial troops were obliged to intrench them&s;elves, under the command of the prince of Baden, as they were not yet joined by the auxiliary forces. The French general, after having faced him about a month, thought proper to repa&s;s the river. Then he detached a body of hor&s;e to Flanders, and can|toned the re&s;t of his troops at Spires, Franckendal, Worms, and O&s;tofen. On the la&s;t day of Augu&s;t the prince of Baden retaliated the in&s;ult, by pa&s;&s;ing the Rhine at Mentz and Coc&s;heim. On the tenth he was joined by general Thungen, who commanded a &s;eparate body, together with the militia of Suabia and Franconia, and advanced to the camp of the enemy, who had rea&s;&s;embled, and were po&s;ted in &s;uch a manner, that he would not hazard an attack. Hav|ing

therefore cannonaded them for &s;ome days, &s;coured the adjacent country by detached parties, and taken the little ca&s;tle of Wiezengen, he repa&s;&s;ed the river at Worms on the &s;eventh day of October: the French likewi&s;e cro&s;&s;ed at Philip&s;burgh, in hope of &s;urpri&s;ing general Thungen, who had taken po&s;t in the neighbourhood of Stra&s;bourg; but, he retired to Eppingen before their arrival, and in a little time both armies were di&s;tributed in winter-quarters. Peter, the czar of Mu&s;covy, carried on the &s;iege of Azoph with &s;uch vigour, that the garri&s;on was obliged to capitulate, after the Ru&s;&s;ians had defeated a great con|voy &s;ent to its relief. The court of Vienna forthwith engaged in an alliance with the Mu&s;covite emperor; but, they did not exert them&s;elves in taking advantage of the di&s;a&s;ter which the Turks had undergone. The Imperial army, com|manded by the elector of Saxony, continued inactive on the river Maro&s;ch till the nineteenth day of July, then they made a &s;eint of attacking Temi&s;waer; but, they marched towards Betzkerch, in their route to Belgrade, on receiving advice that the grand &s;ignor intended to be&s;iege Titul. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t the two armies were in &s;ight of each other. The Turki&s;h hor&s;e attacked the Imperiali&s;ts in a plain near the river Begue; but were repul&s;ed. The Germans next day made a &s;how of retreating, in hope of drawing the ene|my from their intrenchments. The &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded. On the twenty-&s;ixth the Turki&s;h army was in motion; a detachment of the Imperiali&s;ts attacked them in flank as they marched through a wood. A very de&s;perate action en|&s;ued, in which the generals Heu&s;ler and Poland, with many other gallant officers, lo&s;t their lives. At length, the Ottoman hor&s;e were routed; but the Germans were &s;o roughly handled, that on the &s;econd day after the engagement they retreated at midnight, and the Turks remained quiet in their intrench|ments.</P>

<P>In Piedmont the face of affairs underwent a &s;trange alteration. The duke of Savoy, who had for &s;ome time been engaged in a &s;ecret negotia|tion with France, at length embraced the offers of that crown, and privately &s;igned a &s;eparate treaty of peace at Loretto, to which place he repaired on a pretended pilgrimage. The French king engaged to pre&s;ent him with four millions of livres, by way of reparation for the damage he had &s;u&s;tained; to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with a certain number of auxiliaries again&s;t all his enemies, and to effect a marriage between the duke of Burgundy and the prince&s;s of Piedmont, as &s;oon as the parties &s;hould be marriageable. The treaty was guarantied by the pope and the Venetians, who were extremely de&s;irous of &s;eeing the Germans driven out of Italy. King William being apprized of this negotiation, com|municated the intelligence to the earl of Galway, his amba&s;&s;ador at Turin, who expo&s;tulated with the duke upon his defection; but, he per&s;i&s;ted in denying any &s;uch corre&s;pondence, until the advance of the French army enabled him to avow it, without fearing the re&s;entment of the allies whom he had abandoned. Catinat marched into the plains of Turin, at the head of fifty thou&s;and men; an army greatly &s;uperior to that of the confederates. Then he imparted to the mini&s;ters of the allies the propo&s;als which France had made, repre&s;ented the &s;uperior &s;trength of her army, the danger to which he was expo&s;ed, and finally his inclination to embrace her offers. On the twelfth of July a truce was con|cluded for a month, and afterwards prolonged till the fifteenth of September. He wrote to all the powers engaged in the confederacy, except king William,
<PB N="157" REF="1600">
expatiating on the &s;ame topics, and &s;olliciting their con&s;ent. Tho' each in parti|cular refu&s;ed to concur, he on the twenty-third day of Augu&s;t &s;igned the treaty in public, which he had before concluded in private. The emperor was no &s;ooner informed of his de&s;ign, than he took every &s;tep which he thought could divert him from his purpo&s;e. He &s;ent the count Mansfeldt to Turin, with propo&s;als for a match between the king of the Romans and the prince&s;s of Savoy, as well as with offers to augment his forces and his &s;ub&s;idy; but the duke had already &s;ettled his terms with France, from which he would not recede. Prince Eugene, though his kin&s;man, expre&s;&s;ed great indignation at his conduct. The young prince de Commercy was &s;o provoked at his defection, that he challenged him to &s;ingle combat, and the duke accepted of his challenge; but, the quarrel was compromi&s;ed by the intervention of friends, and they parted in an amicable manner. He had concealed the treaty until he &s;hould receive the remaining part of the &s;ub&s;idies due to him from the confederates. A con&s;iderable &s;um had been remitted from England to Genoa for his u&s;e; but, lord Galway no &s;ooner received intimation of his new engagement, than he put a &s;top to the payment of this money, which he employed in the Milaneze for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of tho&s;e troops that were in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice. King William was encamped at Gem|blours when the duke's envoy notified the &s;eparate peace which his ma&s;ter had concluded with the king of France. Though he was extremely chagrined at the information, he di&s;&s;embled his anger, and li&s;tened to the mini&s;ter without the lea&s;t emotion. One of the conditions of this treaty was, That within a limited time the allies &s;hould evacuate the duke's dominions, otherwi&s;e they &s;hould be expelled by the joint-forces of France and Savoy. A neutrality was offered to the confederates; and, this being rejected, the contracting powers re&s;olved to attack the Milaneze. Accordingly, when the truce expired, the duke, as gene|rali&s;&s;imo of the French king, entered that dutchy, and undertook the &s;iege of Valentia; &s;o that, in one campaign, he commanded two contending armies. The garri&s;on of Valentia con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even thou&s;and men, Germans, Spaniards, and French prote&s;tants, made an ob&s;tinate defence; and the duke of Savoy pro|&s;ecuted the &s;iege with uncommon impetuo&s;ity. But, after the trenches had been open for thirteen days, a courier arrived from Madrid with an account of his catholic maje&s;ty's having agreed to the neutrality for Italy. This agreement imported, That there &s;hould be a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms until a general peace could be effected: and, That the Imperial and French troops &s;hould return to their re&s;pective countries. Chri&s;tendom had well nigh been embroiled anew by the death of John Sobie&s;ki king of Poland, who died at the age of &s;eventy, in the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer, after having &s;urvived his faculties and reputation. As the crown was elective, a competition aro&s;e for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The kingdom was divided by factions; and the different powers of Europe intere&s;ted them|&s;elves warmly in the contention.</P>

<P>Nothing of con&s;equence had been lately atchieved by the naval force of England. When the con&s;piracy was fir&s;t di&s;covered, Sir George Rooke had received orders to return from Cadiz; and he arrived in the latter end of April. While he took his place at the board of admiralty, lord Berkeley &s;ucceeded to the command of the fleet; and in the month of June &s;et &s;ail to|wards U&s;hant, in order to in&s;ult the coa&s;t of France. He pillaged and burned the villages on the i&s;lands Grouais, Houat, and Heydic; made prize of about

twenty ve&s;&s;els; bombarded St. Martin's on the i&s;le of Rhee, and the town of Olonne, which was &s;et on fire in &s;i&s;teen different places with the &s;hells and car|ca&s;&s;es. Though the&s;e appear to have been enterprizes of &s;mall import, they certainly kept the whole coa&s;t of France in perpetual alarm. The mini&s;try of that kingdom were &s;o much afraid of inva&s;ion, that between Bre&s;t and Goulet they ordered above one hundred batteries to be erected; and above &s;ixty thou|&s;and men were continually in arms for the defence of the maritime places. In the month of May rear-admiral Benbow $ailed with a &s;mall &s;quadron, in order to block up Du Bart in the harbour of Dunkirk; but, that famous adventurer found means to e&s;cape in a fog, and &s;teering to the ea&s;tward, attacked the Dutch $leet in the Baltick, under a convoy of five frigates. The&s;e la&s;t he took, toge|ther with half the number of the trading &s;hips; but, falling in with the out|ward-bound $leet, convoyed by thirteen &s;hips of the line, he was obliged to burn four of the frigates, turn the fifth adrift, and part with all his prizes but fifteen$ which he carried into Dunkirk.</P>

<P>The parliament of Scotland met on the eighth day of Sep|tember; and lord Murray, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, now earl of Tullibardine, pre|sided as king's commi&s;&s;ioner. Though that kingdom was exhau&s;ted by the war, and two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive bad harve&s;ts, which had driven a great number of the inhabitants into Ireland, there was no oppo&s;ition to the court-mea&s;ures. The members of parliament &s;igned an a&s;&s;ociation like that of England. They granted a &s;upply of one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds for maintaining their forces by &s;ea and land. They pa&s;&s;ed an act for &s;ecuring their religion, lives, and properties, in ca&s;e his maje&s;ty &s;hould come to an untimely death. By another, they obliged all per&s;ons in public tru&s;t to &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociation; and then the parliament was adjourned to the eighth day of December. The di&s;|turbances of Ireland &s;eemed now to be intirely appea&s;ed. Lord Capel dying in May, the council, by virtue of an act pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of Henry VIII. elected the chancellor Sir Charles Porter to be lord ju&s;tice and chief go|vernor of that kingdom, until his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure &s;hould be known. The parliament met in June: the commons expelled Mr. Sander&s;on, the only mem|ber of that hou&s;e who had refu&s;ed to &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociation, and adjourned to the fourth day of Augu&s;t. By that time Sir Charles Porter, and the earls of Montrath and Drogheda, were appointed lords-ju&s;tices, and &s;ignified the king's plea&s;ure that they &s;hould adjourn. In the beginning of December the chancellor died of an apoplexy.</P>

<P>King William being tired of an inactive campaign, left the army under the command of the elector of Bavaria, and, about the lat|ter end of Augu$$, repaired to his palace at Loo, where he enjoyed his fa|vourite exerci&s;e of &s;tag-hunting. He vi&s;ited the court of Brandenburg at Cleves; conferred with the &s;tates of Holland at the Hague; and, embarking for England, landed at Margate on the &s;ixth day of October. The dome&s;tic oeconomy of the nation was extremely perplexed at this juncture, from the &s;inking of public credit, and the &s;tagnation that nece&s;&s;arily attended a recoin|age; grievances which were with diffi$$lty removed by the clear apprehen&s;ion, the enterpri&s;ing genius, the un&s;hake$ fortitude, of Mr. Montague, chancellor of the exchequer, operating upon a national &s;pirit of adventure, which the monied-intere&s;t had produced. The king opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament on the twentieth
<PB N="159" REF="1620">
day of October, with a &s;peech, importing, That overtures had been made for a negotiation; but that the be&s;t way of treating with France would be &s;word in hand. He therefore de&s;ired they would be expeditious in rai&s;ing the &s;up|plies for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, as well as for making good the funds already granted. He declared, that the civil li&s;t could not be &s;upported without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He recommended the mi&s;erable condition of the French prote&s;tants to their compa&s;&s;ion. He de&s;ired they would contrive the be&s;t expedients for the recovery of the national credit; and ob&s;erved, that unanimity and di&s;patch were now more than ever nece&s;&s;ary for the honour, &s;afety, and advantage of England. The commons having taken this &s;peech into con&s;ideration, re&s;olved, That they would &s;upport his maje&s;ty and his government, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the pro&s;ecution of the war: that the &s;tandard of gold and &s;ilver &s;hould not be altered: and, That they would make good all parliamentary funds. Then they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, in a very &s;pirited &s;train, declaring that, notwith&s;tanding the blood and trea&s;ure of which the nation had been drained, the commons of England would not be diverted from their firm re&s;olutions of obtaining by war a &s;afe and honourable peace. They therefore renewed their a&s;&s;urances, that they would &s;upport his maje&s;ty again&s;t all his enemies at home and abroad. The hou&s;e of lords delivered an|other to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, declaring, that they would never be wanting or backward on their parts, in what might be nece&s;&s;ary to his maje&s;ty's honour, the good of his kingdoms, and the quiet of Chri&s;tendom. The commons, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their zeal, ordered two &s;editious pamphlets to be burned by the hands of the common hangman. They deliberated upon the e&s;timates, and granted above &s;ix millions for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year. They re|&s;olved, that a &s;upply &s;hould be granted for making good the deficiency of par|liamentary funds; and appropriated &s;everal duties for this purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to the coin, they brought in a bill, repealing an act for taking off the obligation and encouragement of coining guineas for a certain time, and for importing and coining guineas and half-guineas, as the ex|travagant price of tho&s;e coins which occa&s;ioned this act, was now fallen. They pa&s;&s;ed a &s;econd bill for remedying the ill &s;tate of the coin; and a third, explain|ing an act in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, for laying duties on low wines and &s;pirits of the fir&s;t extraction. In order to rai&s;e the &s;upplies of the year, they re&s;olved to tax all per&s;ons according to the true value of their real and per&s;onal e&s;tates, their &s;tock upon land and in trade, their income by offices, pen&s;ions, and profe&s;&s;ions. A duty of one penny per week for one year, was layed upon all per&s;ons not re|ceiving alms. A further impo&s;ition of one farthing in the pound per week, was fixed upon all &s;ervants receiving four pounds per annum, as wages, and up|wards, to eight pounds a-year inclu&s;ive. Tho&s;e who received from eight to &s;ixteen pounds, were taxed at one half-penny per pound. An aid of three &s;hillings in the pound for one year was layed upon all lands, tenements, and he|reditaments, according to their true value. Without &s;pecifying the particulars of tho&s;e impo&s;itions, we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that in the general charge, the commons did not exempt one member of the commonwealth that could be &s;up|po&s;ed able to bear any part of the burthen. Provi&s;ion was made, that ham|mered money &s;hould be received in payment of the&s;e duties, at the rate of five &s;hillings and eight pence per ounce. All the deficiencies on annuities and mo|nies
<PB N="160" REF="1630">
borrowed on the credit of the exchequer, were transferred to this aid. The trea&s;ury was enabled to borrow a million and half at eight per cent. and to circulate exchequer-bills to the amount of as much more. To cancel the&s;e debts, the &s;urplus of all the &s;upplies, except the three-&s;hilling-aid, was appropriated. The commons voted one hundred and twenty-five thou&s;and pounds for making good the deficiency in recoining the hammered money, and the recompence for bringing in plate to the mint. This &s;um was rai&s;ed by a tax or duty upon wrought-plate, paper, pa&s;teboard, velum, and parchment, made or imported. Taking into con&s;ideration the &s;ervices, and the pre&s;ent langui&s;hing &s;tate of the bank, who&s;e notes were at twenty per cent. di&s;count, they re&s;olved, That it &s;hould be enlarged by new &s;ub&s;criptions, made by four-fifths in tallies &s;truck on parlia|mentary funds, and one-fifth in bank-bills or notes: That effectual provi&s;ion &s;hould be made by parliament, for paying the principal of all &s;uch tallies as &s;hould be &s;ub&s;cribed into the bank, out of the funds agreed to be continued: That an intere&s;t of eight per cent. &s;hould be allowed on all &s;uch tallies: and, That the continuance of the bank &s;hould be prolonged to the fir&s;t day of Au|gu&s;t, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ten: That all a&s;&s;ignments of orders on tallies &s;ub&s;cribed into the bank, &s;hould be regi&s;tered in the exchequer: That, before the day &s;hould be fixed for the beginning of the new &s;ub&s;criptions, the old &s;hould be made one hundred per cent. and what might exceed that va|lue &s;hould be divided among the old members: That all the intere&s;t due on tho&s;e tallies which might be &s;ub&s;cribed into the bank-&s;tock, at the time appointed for &s;ub&s;criptions, to the end of the la&s;t preceding quarter on each tally, &s;hould be allowed as principal: That liberty &s;hould be given by parliament to enlarge the number of bank-bills, to the value of the &s;um that &s;hould be &s;o &s;ub&s;cribed, over and above the twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds; provided they &s;hould be obliged to an&s;wer &s;uch bills and demands, and in default thereof, be an&s;wered by the exchequer out of the fir&s;t money due to them: That no other bank &s;hould be erected or allowed by act of parliament, during the continuance of the bank of England: That this &s;hould be exempted from all tax or impo&s;ition: That no act of the corporation &s;hould forfeit the particular intere&s;t of any per&s;on concerned therein: That provi&s;ion &s;hould be made to prevent the officers of the exche|quer, and all other officers and receivers of the revenue, from diverting, delay|ing, or ob&s;tructing the cour&s;e of payments to the bank: That care &s;hould be taken to prevent the altering, counterfeiting, or forging any bank-bills or notes: That the e&s;tate and intere&s;t of each member in the &s;tock of the corporation &s;hould be made a per&s;onal e&s;tate: That no contract made for any bank-&s;tock to be bought or &s;old, &s;hould be valued in law or equity, unle&s;s actually regi&s;tered in the bank-books within &s;even days, and actually transferred within fourteen days after the contract &s;hould be made. A bill upon the&s;e re&s;olutions was brought in, under the direction of the chancellor of the exchequer: it related to the continuation of tonnage and poundage, upon wine, vinegar, and tobacco: and it comprehended a clau&s;e for laying an additional duty upon &s;alt, for two years and three quarters. All the &s;everal branches con&s;tituted a general fund, &s;ince known by the name of the General mortgage, without prejudice to their former appro|priations. The bill al&s;o provided, That the tallies &s;hould bear eight per cent. inter|e&s;t: That from the tenth of June for five years, they &s;hould bear no more than &s;ix per cent. intere&s;t: and, That no premium or di&s;count upon them &s;hould be
<PB N="161" REF="1640">
taken. In ca&s;e of the general fund's proving in&s;ufficient to pay the whole in|tere&s;t, it was provided, That every proprietor &s;hould receive his proportion of the product, and the deficiency be made good from the next aid; but, &s;hould the fund produce more than the intere&s;t, the &s;urplus was de&s;tined to operate as a &s;inking fund for the di&s;charge of the principal. In order to make up a deficiency of above eight hundred thou&s;and pounds, occa&s;ioned by the failure of the land-bank, additional duties were layed upon leather: the time was en|larged for per&s;ons to come in and purcha&s;e the annuities payable by &s;everal for|mer acts, and to obtain more certain intere&s;t in &s;uch annuities.</P>

<P>Never were more vigorous mea&s;ures taken to &s;upport the credit of the government; and never was the government &s;erved by &s;uch a &s;et of en|terpri&s;ing undertakers. The commons having received a me&s;&s;age from the king touching the condition of the civil li&s;t, re&s;olved, That a &s;um not exceed|ing five hundred and fifteen thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be granted for the &s;upport of the civil li&s;t for the en&s;uing year, to be rai&s;ed by a malt tax and additional duties upon mum, &s;weets, cyder, and perry. They likewi&s;e re&s;olved, That an additional aid of one &s;hilling in the pound &s;hould be layed on land, as an equi|valent for the duty of ten per cent. upon mixed goods. Provi&s;ion was made for rai&s;ing one million four hundred thou&s;and pounds by a lottery. The trea|&s;ury was impowered to i&s;&s;ue an additional number of exchequer-bills to the amount of twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds, every hundred pounds bearing intere&s;t at the rate of five pence a day, and ten per cent. for circulation; and finally, in order to liquidate the tran&s;port-debt, which the funds e&s;tabli&s;hed for that purpo&s;e had not been &s;ufficient to defray, a money-bill was brought in to oblige pedlars and hawkers to take out licences, and pay for them at certain &s;tated prices. One cannot without a&s;toni&s;hment reflect upon the prodigious efforts that were made upon this occa&s;ion, or con&s;ider without indignation the enormous fortunes that were rai&s;ed up by u&s;urers and extortioners from the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their country. The nation did not &s;eem to know its own &s;trength, until it was put to this extraordinary trial; and the experiment of mortgaging funds &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that later mini&s;ters have proceeded in the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem, impo&s;ing burthen upon burthen, as if they thought the &s;inews of the nation could never be over&s;trained.</P>

<P>The public credit being thus bol&s;tered up by the &s;ingular addre&s;s of Mr. Montague, and the bills pa&s;&s;ed for the &s;upplies of the en&s;uing year, the attention of the commons was transferred to the ca&s;e of Sir John Fenwick, who had been apprehended in the month of June at New-Romney, in his way to France. He had, when taken, written a letter to his lady by one Webber, who accompanied him; but, this man being &s;eized, the letter was found, containing &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion as plainly evinced him guilty. He then entered into a treaty with the court for turning evidence, and delivered a long information in writing, which was &s;ent abroad to his maje&s;ty. He made no di&s;coveries that could injure any of the Jacobites, who, by his account and other concurring te&s;timonies, ap|peared to be divided into two parties, known by the names of Compounders and Noncompounders. The fir&s;t, headed by the earl of Middleton, in&s;i&s;ted upon receiving &s;ecurity from king James, that the religion and liberties of England &s;hould be pre&s;erved: whereas, the other party, at the head of which was the earl of Melfort, re&s;olved to bring him in without conditions, relying upon his
<PB N="162" REF="1650">
own honour and genero&s;ity. King William having &s;ent over an order for bringing Fenwick to trial, unle&s;s he &s;hould make more material di&s;coveries, the pri&s;oner, with a view to amu&s;e the mini&s;try, until he could take other mea&s;ures for his own &s;afety, accu&s;ed the earls of Shrew&s;bury, Marlborough, and Bath, the lord Godolphin, and admiral Ru&s;&s;el, of having made their peace with king James, and engaged to act for his intere&s;t. Mean while his lady and relations tampered with the two witne&s;&s;es, Porter and Goodman. The fir&s;t of the&s;e di&s;|covered tho&s;e practices to the government; and one Clancey, who acted as agent for lady Fenwick, was tried, convicted of &s;ubornation, fined, and &s;et in the pillory; but, they had &s;ucceeded better in their attempts upon Goodman, who di&s;appeared: &s;o that one witne&s;s only remained, and Fenwick began to think his life was out of danger. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el acquainted the hou&s;e of commons, that he and &s;everal per&s;ons of quality had been reflected upon in &s;ome informa|tions of Sir John Fenwick; he therefore de&s;ired, that he might have an oppor|tunity to ju&s;tify his own character. Mr. &s;ecretary Trumball produced the pa|pers, which having been read, the commons ordered. That Sir John Fenwick &s;hould be brought to the bar of the hou&s;e. There he was exhorted by the &s;peaker to make an ample di&s;covery; which, however, he declined, without having fir&s;t received &s;ome &s;ecurity that what he might &s;ay &s;hould not prejudice him&s;elf. He was ordered to withdraw, until they &s;hould have deliberated on his reque&s;t. Then he was called in again, and the keeper told him, he might de&s;erve the favour of the hou&s;e by making a full di&s;covery. He de&s;ired he might be in|dulged with a little time to recollect him&s;elf, and promi&s;ed to obey the com|mand of the hou&s;e. This favour being denied, he again in&s;i&s;ted upon having &s;ecurity; which they refu&s;ing to grant, he cho&s;e to be &s;ilent, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the bar. The hou&s;e voted, That his informations reflecting upon the fidelity of &s;everal noblemen, members of the hou&s;e, and others, upon hear&s;ay, were fal&s;e and &s;candalous, contrived to undermine the government, and create jealou&s;ies between the king and his &s;ubjects, in order to &s;tifle the con&s;piracy.</P>

<P>A motion being made, for leave to bring in a bill to attaint him of high-trea&s;on, a warm debate en&s;ued, and the que&s;tion being put, was carried in the affirmative by a great majority. He was furni&s;hed with a copy of the bill, and al|lowed the u&s;e of pen, ink, paper, and coun&s;el. When he pre&s;ented a petition, pray|ing, that his coun&s;el might be heard again&s;t pa&s;&s;ing the bill, they made an order, that his coun&s;el &s;hould be allowed to make his defence at the bar of the hou&s;e: &s;o that he was &s;urpri&s;ed into an irregular trial, in&s;tead of being indulged with an opportunity of offering objections to their pa&s;&s;ing the bill of attainder. He was accordingly brought to the bar of the hou&s;e; and the bill being read in his hearing, the &s;peaker called upon the king's coun&s;el to open the evidence. The pri&s;oner's coun&s;el objected to their proceeding to trial, alledging, that their client had not received the lea&s;t notice of their purpo&s;e, and therefore could not be prepared for his defence; but, that they came to offer their rea&s;ons again&s;t the b$$$. The hou&s;e, after a long debate re&s;olved, That he &s;hould be al|lowed further time to produce witne&s;&s;es in his defence: that the coun&s;el for the king &s;hould likewi&s;e be allowed to produce evidence to prove the trea&s;ons of which he &s;tood indicted: and, an order was made for his being brought to the bar again in three days. In pur&s;uance of this order he appeared, when the in|dictment which had been found again&s;t him by the grand jury, was produced;
<PB N="163" REF="1660">
and Porter was examined as evidence. Then the record of Clancey's convic|tion was read; and one Roe te&s;tified, that Dighton, the pri&s;oner's &s;ollicitor, had offered him an annuity of one hundred pounds, to di&s;credit the te&s;timony of Goodman. The king's coun&s;el moved, that Goodman's examination, as taken by Mr. Vernon, clerk of the council, might be read. Sir J. Powis and Sir Bartholemew Shower, the pri&s;oner's coun&s;el, warmly oppo&s;ed this propo&s;al; they affirmed, that a depo&s;ition taken when the party affected by it was not pre&s;ent to cro&s;s-examine the depo&s;er, could not be admitted in a ca&s;e of five &s;hil|lings value: that though the hou&s;e was not bound by the rules of inferior courts, it was neverthele&s;s bound by the eternal and unalterable rules of ju&s;tice: that no evidence, according to the rules of law, could be admitted in &s;uch a ca&s;e, but that of living witne&s;&s;es: and, that the examination of a per&s;on who is ab&s;ent, was never read to &s;upply his te&s;timony. The di&s;pute between the lawyers on this &s;ubject, gave ri&s;e to a very violent debate among the members of the hou&s;e. Sir Edward Seymour, Sir Richard Temple, Mr. Harley, Mr. Harcourt, Mr. Manley, Sir Chri&s;topher Mu&s;grave, and all the leaders of the Tory-party, ar|gued again&s;t the hard&s;hip and inju&s;tice of admitting this information as an evi|dence. They demon&s;trated, that it would be a &s;tep contrary to the practice of all courts of judicature, repugnant to the common notions of ju&s;tice and huma|nity, diametrically oppo&s;ite to the la&s;t act for regulating trials in ca&s;es of high|trea&s;on, and of dangerous con&s;equences to the lives and liberties of the people. On the other hand, lord Cutts, Sir Thomas Littleton, Mr. Montague, Mr. Smith of the trea&s;ury, and Trevor the attorney-general, affirmed, that the hou&s;e was not bound by any form of law what&s;oever: that this was an extraordinary ca&s;e, in which the &s;afety of the government was deeply concerned: that tho' the common law might require two evidences in ca&s;es of trea&s;on, the hou&s;e had a power of deviating from tho&s;e rules in extraordinary ca&s;es: that there was no rea&s;on to doubt of Sir John Fenwick's being concerned in the con&s;pi|racy: that he or his friends had tampered with Porter: and, that there were &s;trong pre&s;umptions to believe, the &s;ame practices had induced Goodman to ab&s;cond. In a word, the Tories, either from party or patrioti&s;m, &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted the cau&s;e of liberty and humanity, by tho&s;e very arguments which had been u&s;ed again&s;t them in the former reigns; while the Whigs, with equal vio|lence and more &s;ucce&s;s, e&s;pou&s;ed the dictates of arbitrary power and oppre&s;&s;ion, in the face of their former principles, with which they were now upbraided. At length, the que&s;tion was put, Whether or not the information of Goodman &s;hould be read? and was carried in the affirmative by a majority of &s;eventy-three voices. Then two of the grand-jury who had found the indictment, recited the evidence which had been given to them by Porter and Goodman; la&s;tly, the king's coun&s;el in&s;i&s;ted upon producing the record of Cooke's conviction, as he had been tried for the &s;ame con&s;piracy. The pri&s;oner's coun&s;el objected, That if &s;uch evidence was admitted, the trial of one per&s;on in the &s;ame company would be the trial of all; and, it could not be expected that they who came to defend Sir John Fenwick only, &s;hould be prepared to an&s;wer the charge again&s;t Cooke. This article produced another vehement debate among the members; and the Whigs obtained a &s;econd victory. The record was read, and the king's coun&s;el proceeded to call on &s;ome of the jury who &s;erved on Cooke's trial, to affirm, that he had been convicted on Goodman's evidence. Sir Bartholomew Shower &s;aid,
<PB N="164" REF="1670">
he would &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of the hou&s;e, Whether it was ju&s;t that the evidence again&s;t one per&s;on &s;hould conclude again&s;t another &s;tanding at a different bar, in defence of his life? The parties were again ordered to with|draw; and from this point aro&s;e a third debate, which ended as the two former, to the di&s;advantage of the pri&s;oner. The jury being examined, Mr. &s;erjeant Gould moved, that Mr. Vernon might be de&s;ired to produce the intercepted letter from Sir John Fenwick to his lady. The pri&s;oner's coun&s;el warmly op|po&s;ed this motion, in&s;i&s;ting upon their proving it to be his hand-writing before it could be u&s;ed again&s;t him; and no further &s;tre&s;s was layed on this evidence. When they were called upon to enter on his defence, they pleaded incapacity to deliver matters of &s;uch importance after they had been $atigued with twelve hours attendance.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>The hou&s;e re&s;olved to hear &s;uch evidence as the pri&s;oner had to produce that night. His coun&s;el declared, that they had nothing then to pro|duce but the copy of a record; and the &s;econd re&s;olution was, That he &s;hould be brought up again next day at noon. He accordingly appeared at the bar, and Sir J. Powis proceeded on his defence. He ob&s;erved, that the bill under con&s;ideration affected the lives of the &s;ubjects; and &s;uch precedents were dan|gerous: that Sir John Fenwick was forthcoming, in order to be tried by the ordinary methods of ju&s;tice: that he was actually under proce&s;s, had pleaded, and was ready to &s;tand trial: that if there was &s;ufficient clear evidence again&s;t him, as the king's &s;erjeant had declared, there was no rea&s;on for his being de|prived of the benefit of &s;uch a trial as was the birth-right of every Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject; and if there was a deficiency of legal evidence, he thought this was a very odd rea&s;on for the bill. He took notice that even the regicides had the benefit of &s;uch a trial: that the la&s;t act for regulating trials in ca&s;es of trea&s;on, proved the great tenderne&s;s of the laws which affected the life of the &s;ubject: and he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize that the very parliament which had pa&s;&s;ed that law, &s;hould enact another for putting a per&s;on to death without any trial at all. He admitted that there had been many bills of attainder, but they were gene|rally levelled at outlaws and fugitives; and &s;ome of them had been rever&s;ed in the &s;equel, as arbitrary and unju&s;t. He urged, that this bill of attainder did not alledge or &s;ay, that Sir John Fenwick was guilty of the trea&s;on for which he ha$ $een in$$cted; a circum&s;tance which prevented him from producing wit|ne&s;&s;es to that and &s;everal matters upon which the king's coun&s;el had expatiated. He &s;aid, they had introduced evidence to prove circum&s;tances not aliedged in the bill, and defective evidence of tho&s;e that were: that Porter was not exa|mined upon oath: that nothing could be more &s;evere than to pa&s;s &s;entence of death $pon a man, corrupt his blood, and confi&s;cate his e&s;tate, upon parole evi|dence; e&s;pecially of &s;uch a wretch, who, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, had been en|gaged in a crime of the blacke&s;t nature, not a convert to the dictates of con&s;ci|ence, but a coward, &s;hrinking from the danger by which he had been environed, and even now drudging for a pardon. He invalidated the evidence of Goodman's examination. He ob&s;erved, that the indictment mentioned a con&s;piracy to call in a foreign power; but, as this con&s;piracy had not been put in practice, &s;uch an agreement was not a &s;ufficient over-act of trea&s;on, according to the opinion of Hawles the &s;ollicitor-general, concerned in this very pro&s;ecution. So &s;aying, he produced a book of remarks, which that lawyer had publi&s;hed on the ca&s;es
<PB N="165" REF="1680">
of lord Ru&s;&s;el, colonel Sidney, and others who had &s;uffered death in the reign of Charles. This author (&s;aid he) takes notice, that a con&s;piracy or agreement to levy war, is not trea&s;on without actually levying war; a &s;entiment in which he concurred with lord Coke, and lord chief-ju&s;tice Hales: he concluded with &s;ay|ing, <Q>&startq;We know at pre&s;ent on what ground we &s;tand; by the &s;tatute of Edward III. we know what trea&s;on is; by the two &s;tatutes of Edward VI. and the late act, we know what is proof; by the magna charta we know we are to be tried per legem terrae &amp; per judicium parium, by the law of the land and the judgment of our peers; but, if bills of attainder come into fa&s;hion, we &s;hall neither know what is trea&s;on, what is evidence, nor how, nor where we are to be tried.&endq;</Q> He was &s;econded by Sir Bartholomew Shower, who &s;poke with equal energy and elocution; and their arguments were an&s;wered by the king's coun&s;el. The pri&s;oner was afterwards, at the de&s;ire of admiral Ru&s;&s;el, que&s;tioned with regard to the imputations he had fixed upon that gentleman and others, from hear&s;ay; but, he de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed on account of the ri&s;que he ran while under a double pro&s;ecution, if any thing which &s;hould e&s;cape him might be turned to his prejudice.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="44" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>After he was removed from the bar, Mr. Vernon, at the de&s;ire of the hou&s;e, recapitulated the arts and practices of Sir John Fenwick and his friends, to procra&s;tinate the trial. The bill was read a &s;econd time; and the &s;peaker a&s;king, If the que&s;tion &s;hould be put for its being committed? the hou&s;e was immediately kindled into a new flame of contention. Hawles the &s;ollicitor, affirmed, that the hou&s;e in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;hould act both as judge and jury. Mr. Harcourt &s;aid, he knew of no trial for trea&s;on but what was confirmed by magna charta, by a jury, the birthright and darling privilege of an Engli&s;h|man, or per legem terrae, which includes impeachments in parliament: that it was a &s;trange trial where the per&s;on accu&s;ed had a chance to be hanged, but none to be &s;aved: that he never heard of a juryman who was not on his oath, nor of a judge who had not power to examine witne&s;&s;es upon oath, and who was not impowered to &s;ave the innocent as well as to condemn the guilty. Sir Thomas Lyttleton was of opinion, that the parliament ought not to &s;tand upon little niceties and forms of other courts, when the government was at &s;take. Mr. Howe a&s;&s;erted, that to do a thing of this nature, becau&s;e the parliament had power to do it, was a &s;trange way of rea&s;oning: that what was ju&s;tice and equity at We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, was ju&s;tice and equity every where: that one bad precedent in parliament was of wor&s;e con&s;equence than an hundred in We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall, becau&s;e per&s;onal or private injuries did not foreclo&s;e the claims of original right; whereas the parliament could ruin the nation beyond redemp|tion, becau&s;e it could e&s;tabli&s;h tyranny by law. Sir Richard Temple, in arguing again&s;t the bill, ob&s;erved, that the power of parliament is to make any law, but the juri&s;diction of parliament is to govern it&s;elf by the law: to make a law therefore again&s;t all the laws of England was the ultimum remedium &amp; pe&s;&s;imum, never to be u&s;ed but in ca&s;e of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity. He affirmed, that by this prece|dent the hou&s;e overthrew all the laws of England; fir&s;t, in condemning a man upon one witne&s;s; &s;econdly, in pa&s;&s;ing an act without any trial. The commons never did nor can a&s;&s;ume a juri&s;diction of trying any per&s;on; they may, for their own information, hear what can be offered; but, it is not a trial where witne&s;&s;es are not upon oath. All bills of attainder have pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t per&s;ons that were
<PB N="166" REF="1690">
$word$ or fled, or without the compa&s;s of the law: &s;ome have been brought in after trials in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall$ but none of tho&s;e have been called trials, and they were generally rever&s;$d. He denied that the parliament had power to de|clare any thing trea$$n which was not trea&s;on before. When inferior courts were dubious, the ca&s;e might be brought before the parliament, to judge whether it was trea&s;on or felony: but, then they mu&s;t judge by the laws in being; and this judgment was not in the parliament by bill, but, only in the hou&s;e of lords. Lord Digby, Mr. Harley, and colonel Granville, &s;poke to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. But their arguments and remon&s;trances had no effect upon the majority, by whom the pri&s;oner was devoted to de&s;truction. The bill was committed, pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of lords, where it produced the longe&s;t and warme&s;t de|bates which had been known &s;ince the re&s;toration. Bi&s;hop Burnet &s;ignalized his zeal for the government$ by a long &s;peech in favour of the bill, contradict|ing &s;ome of the fundamental maxims which he had formerly avowed in behalf of the liberties of the people. At length, it was carried by a majority of &s;even voices; and one and forty lords, including eight prelates, entered a prote&s;t couched in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, again&s;t the deci&s;ion.</P>

<P>When the bill received the royal a&s;&s;ent, another act of the like na|ture pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t Barclay, Holmes, and nine other con&s;pirators who had fled from ju&s;tice, in ca&s;e thay &s;hould not &s;urrender them&s;elves on or before the twenty-fifth day of March next en&s;uing. Sir John Fenwick &s;ollicited the me|diation of the lords in his behalf, while his friends implored the royal mercy. The peers gave him to under&s;tand, that the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;uit would depend upon the fullne&s;s of his di&s;coveries. He would have previou&s;ly &s;tipulated for a pardon; and they in&s;i&s;ted upon his depending on their favour. He he&s;itated &s;ome time between the fears of infamy and the terrors of death, which la&s;t he at length cho&s;e to undergo, rather than incur the di&s;graceful character of an informer. He was complimented with the ax, in con&s;ideration of his rank and alliance with the hou&s;e of Howard, and &s;uffered on Tower-hill with great com|po&s;ure. In the paper which he delivered to the &s;heriff, he took God to witne&s;s, that he knew not of the intended inva&s;ion, until it was the common &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e; nor was he engaged in any &s;hape for the &s;ervice of king James. He thanked tho&s;e noble and worthy per&s;ons who had oppo&s;ed his attainder in parliament; prote$$$d before God, that the information he gave to the mini&s;try, he had received in letters and me&s;&s;ages from France; and ob&s;erved, that he might have expected mercy from the prince of Orange, as he had been in&s;tru|mental in &s;aving his life, by preventing the execution of a de&s;ign which had been formed again&s;t it; a circum&s;tance which in all probability induced the late con&s;pirators to conceal their purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination from his knowledge. He profe&s;&s;ed his loyalty to king James, and prayed heaven for his &s;peedy re|&s;toration.</P>

<P>While Fenwick's affair was in agitation, the earl of Monmouth had &s;et on foot &s;ome practices again&s;t the duke of Shrew&s;bury. One Matthew Smith, nephew to Sir William Perkins, had been entertained as a &s;py by this nobleman, who finding his intelligence of very little u&s;e or importance, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him as a trouble&s;ome dependant. Then he had recour&s;e to the earl of Monmouth, into whom he infu&s;ed unfavourable &s;entiments of the duke; in&s;i|nuating, that he had made great di&s;coveries, which, from &s;ini&s;ter motives were
<PB N="167" REF="1700">
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Monmouth communicated tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions to the earl of Port|land, who inli&s;ted Smith as one of his intelligencers. Copies of the letters he had &s;ent to the duke of Shrew&s;bury were delivered to &s;ecretary Trumball, &s;ealed up for the peru&s;al of his maje&s;ty at his return from Flanders. When Fenwick mentioned the duke of Shrew&s;bury in his di&s;coveries, the earl of Mon|mouth re&s;olved to &s;eize the opportunity of ruining that nobleman. He, by the canal of the dutche&s;s of Norfolk, exhorted lady Fenwick to prevail upon her hu&s;band to per&s;i&s;t in his accu&s;ation, and even dictated a paper of directions. Fenwick rejected the propo&s;al with di&s;dain, as a &s;candalous contrivance; and Monmouth was &s;o incen&s;ed at his refu&s;al, that when the bill of attainder ap|peared in the hou&s;e of lords, he &s;poke in favour of it with peculiar vehemence$ Lady Fenwick, provoked at this cruel outrage, prevailed upon her nephew the earl of Carli&s;le, to move the hou&s;e, that Sir John might be examined touching any advices that had been &s;ent to him with relation to his di&s;coveries. He gave an account of all the particulars of Monmouth's &s;cheme, which was calculated to ruin the duke of Shrew&s;bury, by bringing Smith's letters on the carpet. The dutche&s;s of Norfolk and a confident were interrogated, and con|firmed the detection. The hou&s;e called for Smith's letters, which were pro|duced by Sir William Trumball. The earl of Monmouth was committed to the Tower, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from all his employments. He was relea&s;ed, how|ever, at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and the court made up all his lo&s;&s;es in private, le&s;t he &s;hould be tempted to join the oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>The Whigs, before they were glutted with the &s;acrifice of Fen|wick, had determined to let loo&s;e their vengeance upon Sir George Rooke, who was a leader in the oppo&s;ite intere&s;t. Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel had been &s;ent with a &s;quadron to look into Bre&s;t, where, according to the intelligence which the government had received, the French were employed in preparing for a de&s;cent upon England; but this information was fal&s;e. They were bu&s;y in equipping an armament for the We&s;t-Indies, under the command of Mr. Pointis, who actually &s;ailed to the coa&s;t of New-Spain, and took the city of Carthagene. Rooke had been ordered to intercept the Toulon &s;quadron in its way to Bre&s;t; but his endeavours mi&s;carried. The commons, in a committee of the whole hou&s;e, re&s;olved to inquire why this fleet was not intercepted? Rooke under|went a long examination, and was obliged to produce his journal, orders, and letters. Shovel and Mitchel were likewi&s;e examined; but, nothing appearing to the prejudice of the admiral, the hou&s;e thought proper to de&s;i&s;t from their pro&s;ecution. After they had determined on the fate of Fenwick, they proceeded to enact &s;everal laws for regulating the dome&s;tic oeconomy of the nation; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Kennet. Oldmixon.

Ever &s;ince the reformation, certain places in and about the city of London, which had been &s;anctuaries during the prevalence of the popi&s;h religion, afforded a&s;ylum to debtors, and were become receptacles of de&s;perate per&s;ons, who pre|&s;umed to &s;et the law at defiance.

He was now &s;worn of the privy-council, and gratified with the office of lord-chamberlain, which had been re&s;igned by the earl of Dor&s;et, a nobleman of elegant talents, and invincible indolence, &s;evere and poignant in his writings and remarks upon mankind in general, but humane, good-na|tured, and generous to exce&s;s, in his commerce with individuals.</P>

<P>William having made &s;ome promotions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Somers was created a baron, and appointed lord$chancellor of England: admiral Ru&s;&s;el was dignified with the title of earl of O$ford. In Fe|bruary the earl of Ayle&s;bury, who had been com|mitted on account of the con&s;piracy, was relea&s;ed upon bail; but, this privilege was denied to lord Montgomery, who had been impri&s;oned in Newgate on the &s;ame account.</NOTE>, and appointed a re|gency, embarked on the twenty &s;ixth day of April for Holland, that he might be at hand to manage the negotiation for a general peace. By this time the preliminaries were &s;ettled, between Callieres the French mini&s;ter, and Mr. Dyk|veldt in behalf of the &s;tates general, who re&s;olved, in con&s;equence of the con|ce&s;&s;ions made by France, that, in concert with their allies, the mediation of Sweden might be accepted. The emperor and the court of Spain, however, were not &s;atisfied with tho&s;e conce&s;&s;ions; yet, his Imperial maje&s;ty declared, he would embrace the proffered mediation, provided the treaty of We&s;tphalia &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; and the king of Sweden would engage to join his troops with tho&s;e of the allies, in ca&s;e France &s;hould break through this &s;tipu|lation. This propo&s;al being delivered, the mini&s;ters of England and Holland at Vienna, pre&s;ented a joint-memorial, pre&s;&s;ing his Imperial maje&s;ty to accept the mediation without re&s;erve, and name a place at which the congre&s;s might be opened. The emperor complied with reluctance. On the fourteenth day of February, all the mini&s;ters of the allies, except the amba&s;&s;ador of Spain, agreed to the propo&s;al; and next day &s;ignified their a&s;&s;ent in form to Mr. Lillieroot the Swedi&s;h plenipotentiary. Spain demanded, as a preliminary, that France would agree to re&s;tore all the places mentioned in a long li&s;t, which the mini&s;ter of that crown pre&s;ented to the a&s;&s;embly. The emperor propo&s;ed, that the congre&s;s &s;hould be held at Aix-la-Chapelle, or Franckfort, or &s;ome other town in Ger|many. The other allies were more di&s;po&s;ed to negotiate in Holland. At length, the French king &s;ugge&s;ted, that no place would be more proper than a palace belonging to king William, called Newbourg-hou&s;e, &s;ituated between the Hague and Delft, clo&s;e by the village of Ry&s;wick; and to this propo&s;ition the mini&s;ters agreed. Tho&s;e of England were, the earl of Pembroke, a virtuous, learned, and popular nobleman, the lord Villiers, and Sir Jo&s;eph William&s;on; and France &s;ent Harlay and Crecy to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Callieres. Lewis was not only tired of the war, on account of the mi&s;ery in which it had involved his kingdom; but, in de&s;iring a peace he was actuated by another motive. The king of Spain had been for &s;ome time in a very ill &s;tate of health, and the French monarch had an eye to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This aim could not be accom|pli&s;hed while the confederacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; therefore he eagerly &s;ought a peace, that he might at once turn his whole power again&s;t Spain, as &s;oon as Charles &s;hould expire. The emperor harboured the &s;ame de&s;ign upon the Spani&s;h
<PB N="169" REF="1720">
crown, and for that rea&s;on intere&s;ted him&s;elf in the continuance of the grand alliance. Be&s;ides, he fore&s;aw he &s;hould in a little time be able to act again&s;t France with an augmented force. The czar of Mu&s;covy had engaged to find employment for the Turks and Tartars. He intended to rai&s;e the elector of Saxony to the throne of Poland; and he had made &s;ome progre&s;s in a negotiation with the Circles of the Rhine, for a con&s;iderable body of auxiliary troops. The Dutch had no other view but that of &s;ecuring a barrier in the Netherlands. King William in&s;i&s;ted upon the French king's acknowledging his title; and the Engli&s;h nation wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much as the end of a ruinous war. On the tenth day of February, Callieres, in the name of his ma&s;ter, agreed to the following preliminaries: That the treaties of We&s;tphalia and Nimeguen &s;hould be the ba&s;is of this negotiation: That Stra&s;burg &s;hould be re&s;tored to the Empire, and Luxemburg to the Spaniards, together with Mons, Charleroy, and all places taken by the French in Catalonia &s;ince the treaty of Nimeguen: That Dinant &s;hould be ceded to the bi&s;hop of Liege, and all reuni|ons &s;ince the treaty of Nim$guen, be made void: That the French king &s;hould make re&s;titution of Lorraine; and, upon conclu&s;ion of the peace, acknowledge the prince of Orange as king of Great-Britain, without condition or re&s;erve. The conferences were interrupted by the death of Charles XI. king of Sweden, who was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Charles, then a minor; but, the queen and five &s;enators, whom the late king had by will appointed admini&s;trators of the go|vernment, re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the mediation, and &s;ent a new commi&s;&s;ion to Lillienroot for that purpo&s;e. The ceremonials being regulated with the con&s;ent of all parties, the plenipotentiaries of the emperor delivered their ma&s;ter's de|mands to the mediator, on the twenty-&s;econd day of May, and &s;everal German mini&s;ters gave in the preten&s;ions of the re&s;pective princes whom they re|pre&s;ented.</P>

<P>Mean while, the French king, in the hope of procuring more favourable terms, re&s;olved to make his la&s;t effort again&s;t the Spaniards in Ca|talonia and in the Netherlands, and to elevate the prince of Conti to the throne of Poland; an event which would greatly improve the intere&s;t of France in Europe. Lewis had got the &s;tart of the confederates in Flanders, and &s;ent thither a very numerous army, commanded by Catinat, Villeroy, and Boufflers. The campaign was opened with the &s;iege of Aeth, which was no &s;ooner inve&s;ted, than king William having recovered of an indi&s;po&s;ition, took the field, and had an interview with the duke of Bavaria, who commanded a &s;eparate body. He did not think proper to interrupt the enemy in their operations before Aeth, which &s;urrendered in a few days after the trenches were opened; but, contented him&s;elf with taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an advantageous camp, where he covered Bru&s;&s;els, which Villeroy and Boufflers had determined to be&s;iege. In Catalonia the duke of Vendome inve&s;ted Barcelona, in which there was a garri&s;on of ten thou&s;and regular &s;oldiers, be&s;ides five thou&s;and burghers, who had voluntarily taken arms on this occa&s;ion. The governor of the place was the prince of He&s;&s;e d'Arm&s;tadt, who had &s;erved in Ireland, and been ve&s;ted with the command of the Imperial troops which were &s;ent into Spain. The French general being rein|forced from Provence and Languedoc, carried on his approaches with &s;urpri&s;ing impetuo&s;ity; and was repul&s;ed in &s;everal attacks by the valour of the defendants. At length, the enemy &s;urpri&s;ed and routed the viceroy of Catalonia; and, flu&s;hed
<PB N="170" REF="1730">
with this victory, &s;tormed the outworks, which had been long battered with their cannon. The di&s;pute was very bloody and ob&s;tinate; but, the French by dint of numbers made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the covered-way and two ba&s;tions. There they erected batteries of cannon and mortars, and fired furiou&s;ly on the town, which, however, the prince of He&s;&s;e re&s;olved to defend to the la&s;t extremity. The court of Madrid, however, unwilling to &s;ee the place intirely ruined, as in all probability it would be re&s;tored at the peace, di&s;patched an order to the prince to capitulate; and he obtained very honourable terms, after having made a glorious defence for nine weeks; in con&s;ideration of which he was appointed viceroy of the province. France was no &s;ooner in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this important place, than the Spaniards became as eager for peace as they had been aver&s;e to a negotiation.</P>

<P>Their impatience was not a little inflamed by the &s;ucce&s;s of Pointis in America, where he took Carthagene, in which he found a booty amounting to eight millions of crowns. Having ruined the fortifications of the place, and received advice, that an Engli&s;h &s;quadron under admiral Nevil had arrived in the We&s;t-Indies, with a de&s;ign to attack him in his return, he bore away for the &s;traights of Bahama. On the twenty-&s;econd day of May he fell in with the Engli&s;h fleet, and one of his fly-boats was taken; but, &s;uch was his dexterity, or good fortune, that he e&s;caped, after having been pur&s;ued five days, during which the Engli&s;h and Dutch rear-admirals &s;prang their foretopma&s;ts, and re|ceived other damage, &s;o as that they could not proceed. Then Nevil &s;teered to Carthagene, which he found quite abandoned by the inhabitants, who, after the departure of Pointis, had been rifled a &s;econd time by the buccaneers, on pretence that they had been defrauded of their &s;hare of the plunder. This was really the ca&s;e: they had in a great mea&s;ure contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of Pointis, and were very ill rewarded. In a few days the Engli&s;h admiral di&s;covered eight &s;ail of their &s;hips, two of which were forced on &s;hore and de&s;troyed, two taken, and the re&s;t e&s;caped. Then he directed his cour&s;e to Jamaica, and, by the advice of the governor, Sir William Bee&s;ton, detached rear-admiral Meeze with &s;ome &s;hips and forces to attack Petit-Guavas, which he accordingly &s;urpri&s;ed, burned, and reduced to a&s;hes. After this &s;mall expedition Nevil proceeded to the Ha|vannah, on purpo&s;e to take the galleons under his convoy for Europe, according to the in&s;tructions he had received from the king; but, the governor of the place, and the general of the plate-fleet, &s;u&s;pecting &s;uch an offer, would neither &s;uffer him to enter the harbour, nor put the galleons under his protection. He now &s;ailed through the gulph of Florida to Virginia, where he died of chagrin; and the command of the fleet devolved to captain Dilkes, who arrived in Eng|land on the twenty fourth day of October, with a &s;hattered &s;quadron half-manned, to the un&s;peakable mortification of $he people, who flattered them|&s;elves with the hopes of wealth and glory from this expedition. Pointis &s;teering to the banks of Newfoundland, entered the bay of Conception, at a time when a $tout Engli&s;h &s;quadron commanded by commodore Norris lay at anchor in the bay of St. John's. This officer being informed of the arrival of a French fleet, at fir&s;t concluded, that it was the &s;quadron of Mr. Ne&s;mond come to attack them, and exerted his utmo&s;t endeavours to put the place in a po&s;ture of de|fence; but, afterwards under&s;tanding, that it was Pointis returning with the &s;poil of Carthagene, he called a council of war, and propo&s;ed to go immediately
<PB N="171" REF="1740">
in que&s;t of the enemy. He was, howeven, over-ruled by a majority, who gave it as their opinion, that they &s;hould remain where they were, without run|ning unnece&s;&s;ary hazards. By virtue of this &s;candalous determination, Pomels was permitted to proceed on his voyage to Europe; but, he had not yet e&s;caped every danger. On the fourteenth day of Augu&s;t he $ell in with a &s;quadron under the command of captain Harlow, by whom he was boldly engaged till night parted the combatants. He was pur&s;ued next day; but his &s;hips $ailing better than tho&s;e of Harlow, he accompli&s;hed his e&s;cape, and on the morrow entered the harbour of Bre&s;t. That his &s;hips which were foul &s;hould outfail the Engli&s;h &s;quadron which had ju&s;t put to &s;ea, was a my&s;tery which the people of England could not explain. They complained of having been betrayed through the whole cour&s;e of the We&s;t-Indian expedition. The king owned he did not under&s;tand marine affairs, the intire conduct of which he abandoned to Ru&s;&s;el, who became proud, arbitrary, and unpopular$ and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be be|trayed by his dependants. Certain it is, the &s;ervice was greatly ob$tructed by faction among the officers, which with re&s;pect to the nation had all the effects of treachery and mi&s;conduct.</P>

<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the French in Catalonia, Flanders, and the We&s;t-Indies, was ballanced by their di&s;appointment in Poland. Lewis, encouraged by the remon&s;trances of the abb&eacute; de Polignac$ who managed the affairs of France in that kingdom, re&s;olved to &s;upport the prince of Conti as a candidate for the crown, and remitted great &s;ums of money, which were di&s;tributed among the Poli&s;h nobility. The emperor had at fir&s;t declared for the &s;on of the late king; but, finding the French party too &s;trong for this competitor, he entered into a negotiation with the elector of Saxony, who agreed to change his religion, to di&s;tribute eight millions of florins among the Poles, to confirm then privileges, and advance with his troops to the frontiers of that kingdom. Then he declared him&s;elf a candidate, and was publicly e&s;pou&s;ed by the Imperiali&s;ts. The duke of Lorrain, the prince of Baden$ and Don Livio Ode&s;chalchi, nephew to pope Innocent, were likewi&s;e competitors; but, finding their intere&s;t in&s;uffi|cient, they united their influence with that of the elector, who was proclaimed king of Poland. He forthwith took the oaths required, procured an atte&s;tation from the Imperial court of his having changed his religion, and marched with his army to Cracow, where he was crowned with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity. Lewis per&s;i&s;ted in maintaining the preten&s;ions of the prince of Conti, and equipped a fleet at Dunkirk for his convoy to Dantzick in his way to Poland. But the magi&s;|trates of that city, who had declared for the new king, would not &s;uffer his men to land, though they offered to admit him&s;elf with a &s;mall retinue. He there|fore went on &s;hore at Marienburg, where he was met by &s;ome chiefs of his own party; but, the new king Augu&s;tus acted with &s;uch vigilance, that he found it impracticable to form an army: be&s;ides, he &s;u&s;pected the fidelity of his own Poli&s;h parti&s;ans; he therefore refu&s;ed to part with the trea&s;ure he had brought, and in the beginning of winter returned to Dunkirk.</P>

<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of Augu&s;tus on the throne of Poland was in &s;ome mea&s;ure owing to the conduct of Peter the czar of Mu&s;covy, who having formed great de&s;igns again&s;t the Ottoman-Porte, was very unwilling to &s;ee the crown of Poland po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a parti&s;an of France, which was in alliance with the grand &s;ignor. He therefore intere&s;ted him&s;elf warmly in the di&s;pute, and or|dered
<PB N="172" REF="1750">
his general to a&s;&s;emble an army on the frontiers of Lithuania, which, by overawing the Poles that were in the intere&s;t of the prince of Conti, con|&s;iderably influenced the election. This extraordinary legi&s;lator, who was a &s;trange compound of heroi&s;m and barbarity, con&s;cious of the defects in his education, and of the gro&s;s ignorance that over&s;pread his dominions, re|&s;olved to extend his ideas, and improve his judgment by travelling; and that he might be the le&s;s re&s;tricted by forms, or interrupted by officious curio&s;ity, he determined to travel in di&s;gui&s;e. He was extremely ambitious of becoming a maritime power, and in particular, of maintaining a fleet in the Black|&s;ea; and his immediate aim was to learn the principles of &s;hip-building. He appointed an emba&s;&s;ay for Holland, to regulate &s;ome points of commerce with the &s;tates general. Having intru&s;ted the care of his dominions to per&s;ons in whom he could confide, he di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf, and travelled as one of their retinue. He fir&s;t di&s;clo&s;ed him&s;elf to the elector of Brandenburgh in Pru&s;&s;ia, and afterwards to king William, with whom he conferred in private at Utrecht. He engaged him&s;elf as a common labourer with a &s;hip-carpenter in Holland, whom he &s;erved for &s;ome months with wonderful patience and a&s;&s;iduity. He afterwards vi&s;ited England, where he amu&s;ed him&s;elf chiefly with the &s;ame kind of occupation. From thence he &s;et out for Vienna, where receiving advices from his domini|ons, that his &s;i&s;ter was concerned in managing intrigues again&s;t his govern|ment, he returned &s;uddenly to Mo&s;cow, and found the machinations of the con&s;pirators were already baffled by the vigilance and fidelity of the foreigners to whom he had left the care of the admini&s;tration. His &s;avage nature, however, broke out upon this occa&s;ion: he ordered &s;ome hundreds to be hanged all round his capital; and a good number were beheaded, he him&s;elf with his own hand performing the office of executioner.</P>

<P>The negotiations at Ry&s;wick proceeded very &s;lowly for &s;ome time. The Imperial mini&s;ters demanded, that France &s;hould make re&s;titution of all the places and dominions &s;he had wre&s;ted from the empire &s;ince the peace of Mun&s;ter, whether by force of arms or pretence of right. The Spaniards claimed all that they could demand by virtue of the peace of Nimeguen and the treaty of the Pyrenees. The French affirmed, that if the preliminaries offered by Callieres were accepted, the&s;e propo&s;itions could not be taken into con&s;ideration. The Imperiali&s;ts per&s;i&s;ted in demanding a circum&s;tantial an&s;wer, article by arti|cle. The Spaniards in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;ame manner of proceeding, and called upon the mediator and Dutch mini&s;ters to &s;upport their preten&s;ions. The ple|nipotentiaries of France declared, they would not admit any demand or propo|&s;ition, contrary to the preliminary articles; but, were willing to deliver in a project of peace, in order to &s;horten the negotiation; and the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;adors con&s;ented to this expedient. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the earl of Portland held a conference with marechal Boufflers near Halle, in &s;ight of the two oppo&s;ite armies, which was continued in five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive meetings. On the &s;econd day of Augu&s;t they retired together to a hou&s;e in the &s;uburbs of Halle, and mutu|ally &s;igned a paper, in which the principal articles of the peace between France and England were adj$$&s;ted. Next day king William quitted the camp, and retired to his hou&s;e at L$o, confident of having taken &s;uch mea&s;ures for a paci|fication as could not be di&s;appointed. The &s;ubject of this field-negotiation is &s;aid to have turned upon the intere&s;ts of king James, which the French monarch
<PB N="173" REF="1760">
promi&s;ed to abandon; and others &s;uppo&s;e, that the fir&s;t foundation of the par|tition-treaty was layed in this conference. But, in all probability, William's &s;ole aim was to put an end to an expen&s;ive and un&s;ucce&s;sful war, which had rendered him very unpopular in his own dominions, and to obtain from the court of France an acknowledgment of his title, which had &s;ince the queen's death become the &s;ubject of di&s;pute. He perceived the emperor's back|wardne&s;s towards a pacification, and fore&s;aw numberle&s;s difficulties in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing &s;uch a complication of intere&s;ts by the common method of treating: he there|fore cho&s;e &s;uch a &s;tep as he thought would alarm the jealou&s;y of the allies, and quicken the negotiation at Ry&s;wick. Before the congre&s;s was opened, king James had publi&s;hed two manife&s;tos, addre&s;&s;ed to the catholic and prote&s;tant princes of the confederacy, repre&s;enting his wrongs, and craving redre&s;s; but, his remon&s;trances being altogether di&s;regarded, he afterwards i&s;&s;ued a third de|claration, &s;olemnly prote&s;ting again&s;t all that might or &s;hould be negotiated, regulated, or &s;tipulated with the u&s;urper of his realms, as being void of all rightful and lawful authority. On the twentieth day of July the French am|ba&s;&s;adors produced their project of a general peace, declaring at the &s;ame time, that &s;hould it not be accepted before the la&s;t day of Augu&s;t, France would not hold her&s;elf bound for the conditions &s;he now offered; but Caunitz the emperor's plenipotentiary prote&s;ted, he would pay no regard to this limitation. On the thirtieth of Augu&s;t, however, he delivered to the mediator an ultimatum, im|porting, That he adhered to the treaties of We&s;tphalia and Nimeguen, and ac|cepted of Stra&s;burg with its appurtenances: That he in&s;i&s;ted upon the re&s;titution of Lorraine to the prince of that name: and demanded, That the church and chapter of Liege &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their inconte&s;table rights. Next day the French plenipotentiaries declared, That the month of Augu&s;t being now expired, all their offers were vacated: That therefore the king of France would re&s;erve Stra&s;burg, and unite it, with its dependencies, to his crown for ever: that in other re&s;pects he would adhere to the project, and re&s;tore Barcelona to the crown of Spain; but, that the&s;e terms mu&s;t be accepted in twenty days, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould think him&s;elf at liberty to recede. The mi|ni&s;ters of the electors and princes of the empire joined in a written remon|&s;trance to the Spani&s;h plenipotentiaries, repre&s;enting the inconveniencies and dangers that would accrue to the Germanic body from France's being in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Luxemburg, and exhorting them in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to reject all offers of an equivalent for that province. They likewi&s;e pre&s;ented another to the &s;tates-general, requiring them to continue the war according to their en|gagements, until France &s;hould have complied with the preliminaries. No re|gard, however, was payed to either of the&s;e addre&s;&s;es. Then the Imperial am|ba&s;&s;adors demanded the good offices of the mediator, on certain articles; but all that he could obtain of France was, that the term for adju&s;ting the peace be|tween her and the emperor &s;hould be prolonged till the fir&s;t day of November, and in the mean time an armi&s;tice be punctually ob&s;erved. Yet even the&s;e con|ce&s;&s;ions were made, on condition that the treaty with England, Spain, and Hol|land, &s;hould be &s;igned on that day, even though the emperor and empire &s;hould not concur.</P>

<P>Accordingly, on the twentieth day of September, the articles were &s;ub&s;cribed by the Dutch, Engli&s;h, Spani&s;h, and French amba&s;&s;adors, while the
<PB N="174" REF="1770">
Imperial mini&s;ters prote&s;ted again&s;t the tran&s;action, ob&s;erving, this was the &s;e|cond time that a $eparate peace had been concluded with France; and that the &s;tates of the empire, who had been impo&s;ed upon through their own credulity, would not for the future be &s;o ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to engage in confederacies. In certain preparatory articles &s;ettled between England and France, king William promi&s;ed to pay a yearly pen&s;ion to queen Mary D'E&s;te, of fifty thou&s;and pounds, or &s;uch &s;um as &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for that purpo&s;e by act of parlia|ment. The treaty it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventeen articles. The French king engag|ed, that he would not di&s;turb or di&s;quiet the king of Great-Britain in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his realms or government; nor a&s;&s;i&s;t his enemies, nor favour con&s;pira|cies again&s;t his per&s;on. This obligation was reciprocal. A free commerce was re&s;tored. Commi&s;&s;aries were appointed to meet at London, and &s;ettle the pre|ten&s;ions of each crown to Hud&s;on's bay, taken by the French during the late peace, and retaken by the Engli&s;h in the cour&s;e of the war; and to regulate the limits of places to be re&s;tored, as well as the exchanges to be made. It was likewi&s;e &s;tipulated, That, in ca&s;e of a rupture, &s;ix months &s;hould be allowed to the &s;ubjects of each power for removing their effects: That the &s;eparate article of the treaty of Nimeguen, relating to the principality of Orange, &s;hould be in|tirely executed: and, That the ratifications &s;hould be exchanged in three weeks from the day of &s;igning. The treaty between France and Holland imported a general armi&s;tice, a perpetual amity, a mutual re&s;titution, a reciprocal renun|ciation of all preten&s;ions upon each other, a confirmation of the peace with Savoy, a re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the treaty concluded between France and Bran|denburgh, in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-nine, a compre|hen&s;ion of Sweden, and all tho&s;e powers that &s;hould be named before the ratifi|cation, or in &s;ix months after the conclu&s;ion of the treaty. Be&s;ides, the Dutch mini$ters concluded a treaty of commerce with France, which was immedi|ately put in execution. Spain had great rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the pacifica|tion, by which &s;he recovered Gironne, Ro&s;es, Barcelona, Luxemburg, Char|leroy, Mons, Courtray, and all the towns, fortre&s;&s;es, and territories taken by the French in the province of Luxemburg, Namur, Brabant, Flanders, and Hainault, except eighty-two towns and villages claimed by the French: this di&s;pute was left to the deci&s;ion of commi&s;&s;aries; or, in ca&s;e they &s;hould not agree, to the determination of the &s;tates-general. A remon&s;trance in fa|vour of the French prote&s;tant refugees in England, Holland, and Germany, was delivered by the earl of Pembroke to the mediator, in the name of the prote&s;tant allies, on the day that preceded the conclu&s;ion of the treaty; but, the French plenipotentiaries declared, in the name of their ma&s;ter, that as he did not pretend to pre&s;cribe rules to king William about the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, he expected the &s;ame liberty with re&s;pect to his own. No other effort was made in behalf of tho&s;e con&s;cientious exiles: the treaties were ratified, and the peace proclaimed at Paris and London.</P>

<P>The emperor &s;till held out, and perhaps was encouraged to per&s;evere in his ob&s;tinacy by the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms in Hungary, where his general, prince E$gene of Savoy, obtained a complete victory at Zenta over the forces of the grand &s;ignor, who commanded his army in per&s;on. In this battle, which was fought on the eleventh day of September, the grand vizir, the aga of the ja|nizaries, &s;even $nd twenty ba&s;haws, and about thirty thou&s;and men, were killed
<PB N="175" REF="1780">
or drowned in the river They&s;&s;e; &s;ix thou&s;and were wounded or taken, toge|ther with all their artillery, tents, baggage, provi&s;ion, and ammunition, the grand &s;ignor him&s;elf e&s;caping with difficulty: a victory the more glorious and acceptable, as the Turks had a great &s;uperiority in point of number, and as t$e Imperiali&s;ts did not lo$e a thou&s;and men during the whole action. T$e emperor perceiving that the event of this battle had no effect in retarding the treaty, thought proper to make u&s;e of the armi&s;tice, and continue the nego|tiation after the forementioned treaties had been &s;igned. This was likewi&s;e the ca&s;e with the princes of the empire; though tho&s;e of the prote&s;tant per&s;ua&s;ion complained, that their intere&s;t was neglected. In one of the articles of the treaty it was &s;tipulated, That in the places to be re&s;tored by France, the ro|man catholic religion &s;hould continue as it had been re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. The am|ba&s;&s;adors of the prote&s;tant princes joined in a remon&s;trance, demanding. That the lutheran religion &s;hould be r$&s;tored in tho&s;e places where it had formerly prevailed; but, this demand was rejected, as being equally di&s;agreeable to France and the emperor. Then they refu&s;ed to &s;ign the treaty, which was now concluded between France, the emperor, and the catholic princes of the empire. By this pacification Treves, the Palatinate, and Lorraine, were re&s;tored to their re&s;pective owners. The counties of Spanheim and Veldentz, together with the dutchy of Deux$Ponts, were ceded to the king of Sweden. Francis-Lewis Palatine was confirmed in the electorate of Cologne; and the cardinal of Fur&s;temberg re&s;tored to all his rights and benefices. The claims of the dutche&s;s of Orleans upon the Palatinate, were referred to the arbitration of France and the emperor; and in the mean time the elector palatine agreed to &s;upply her highne&s;s with an annuity of one hundred thou&s;and florins. The mi|ni&s;ters of the prote&s;tant princes publi&s;hed a formal declaration again&s;t the clau&s;e relating to religion, and afterwards &s;olemnly prote&s;ted again&s;t the manner in which the negotiation had been conducted. Such was the i&s;&s;ue of a long and bloody war, which had drained England of her wealth and people$ almo&s;t in|tirely ruined her commerce, debauched her morals, by encouraging venality and corruption, and entailed upon her the cur&s;e of foreign connexions$ a$ well as a national debt, which has gradually increa&s;ed to an intolerable burthen. After all the blood and trea&s;ure which had been expended, William'$ ambition and revenge remained un&s;atisfied. Neverthele&s;s, he reaped the &s;olid advantage of &s;eeing him&s;elf firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the Engli&s;h throne; and the con|federacy, though not &s;ucce&s;sful in every in&s;tance, accompli&s;hed their great aim of putting a &s;top to the encroachments of the French monarch. They mortified his vanity, they humbled his pride and arrogance$ and compelled him to di&s;gorge the acqui&s;itions which, like a robber he had made, in violation of public faith, ju&s;tice, and humanity. Had the allies been true to one another, had they acted from genuine zeal for the common intere&s;ts of mankind, and pro|&s;ecuted with vigour the plan which was originally concerted, Lewis would in a few campaigns have been reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of di&s;grace, de&s;pond|ence, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; for he was de&s;titute of true courage and magn$nimity. King William having fini&s;hed this important tran&s;action, returned to England about the middle of November, and was received in Londo$ amid&s;t the accla|mations of the people, who now again hailed him as their deliverer from a war, by the continuance of which they mu&s;t have been infallibly beggared.</P>

<P>WHEN the king opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament on the third day of December, he told them the war was brought to the end they all propo&s;ed, namely, an honourable peace. He gave them to under&s;tand there was a con&s;iderable debt on account of the fleet and army: that the revenues of the crown had been anticipated: and he expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that they would provide for him during his life, in &s;uch a manner as would conduce to his own honour and that of the government. He recommended the maintenance of a con&s;iderable navy; and gave it as his opinion, that for the pre&s;ent England could not be &s;afe without a &s;tanding army. He promi&s;ed to rectify &s;uch corrup|tions and abu&s;es as might have crept into any part of the admini&s;tration during the war; and effectually to di&s;courage prophanene&s;s and immorality. Finally, he a&s;&s;ured them, that as he had re&s;cued their religion, laws, and liberties, when they were in the extreme&s;t danger, &s;o he &s;hould place the glory of his reign in pre&s;erving and leaving them intire to late&s;t po&s;terity. To this &s;peech the com|mons replied in an addre&s;s, by a compliment of congratulation upon the peace, and an a&s;&s;urance, that they would be ever ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport his ma|je&s;ty, who had confirmed them in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their rights and liber|ties; and by putting an end to the war fully completed the work of their deli|verance. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e appearances of good humour, the majority of the hou&s;e, and indeed of the whole nation, were equally alarmed and exa&s;pe|rated at a project for maintaining a &s;tanding army, which was countenanced at court, and even recommended by the king in his &s;peech to the parliament$ William's genius was altogether military. He could not bear the thoughts of being a king without power. He could not without reluctance di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e officers who had given &s;o many proofs of their courage and fidelity. He did not think him&s;elf &s;afe upon the naked throne in a kingdom that &s;warmed with malcontents, who had &s;o often con&s;pired again&s;t his per&s;on and government. He dreaded the ambition and known perfidy of the French king, who &s;till re|tained a powerful army. He fore&s;aw that a reduction of the forces would le&s;&s;en his importance both at home and abroad, dimini&s;h the dependence upon his government, and di&s;per&s;e tho&s;e foreigners in who&s;e attachment he chiefly con|fided. He communicated his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject to his confident the earl of Sunderland, who knew by experience the aver&s;ion of the people to a &s;tand|ing army; neverthele&s;s encouraged him with hope of &s;ucce&s;s, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the commons would &s;ee the difference between an army rai&s;ed by the king's private authority, and a body of veteran troops maintained by con&s;ent of par|liament for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom. This was a di&s;tinction to which the people payed no regard. All the jealou&s;y of former parliaments &s;eemed to be rou&s;ed by the bare propo&s;al; and this was inflamed by a national prejudice
<PB N="178" REF="1810">
again&s;t the refugees, in who&s;e favour the king had betrayed repeated marks of partial indulgence. They were &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, tractable, and wholly dependent upon his will and genero&s;ity. The Jacobites failed not to cheri&s;h the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;atisfaction, and reproach the Whigs who countenanced this mea&s;ure. They branded that party with apo&s;tacy from their former principles. They ob&s;erved, that the very per&s;ons who in the late reigns endeavoured to abridge the prero|gative, and deprive the king of that &s;hare of power which was ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to actuate the machine of government, were now become advocates for maintaining a &s;tanding army in time of peace; nay, and impudently avowed, that their complai&s;ance to the court in this particular, was owing to their de&s;ire of excluding from all &s;hare in the admini&s;tration a faction di&s;affected to his maje&s;ty, which might mi&s;lead him into more pernicious mea&s;ures. The majo|rity of tho&s;e who really entertained revolution principles, oppo&s;ed the court, from apprehen&s;ions that a &s;tanding army once e&s;tabli&s;hed, would take root and grow into an habitual maxim of government: that, &s;hould the people be di&s;|armed, and the &s;word left in the hands of mercenaries, the liberties of the na|tion mu&s;t be entirely at the mercy of him by whom tho&s;e mercenaries &s;hould be commanded. They might overawe elections, dictate to parliaments, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h a tyranny before the people could take any mea&s;ures for their own pro|tection. They could not help thinking it was po&s;&s;ible to form a militia, that with the concurrence of a fleet might effectually protect the kingdom from the dangers of an inva&s;ion. They firmly believed, that a militia might be regu|larly trained to arms, &s;o as to acquire the dexterity of profe&s;&s;ed &s;oldiers, and they did not doubt they would &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e hirelings in courage, con&s;idering that they would be animated by every concurring motive of intere&s;t, &s;entiment, and affection. Nay, they argued, that Britain, &s;urrounded as it was by a boi&s;|terous &s;ea, &s;ecured by floating bulwarks, abounding with &s;tout and hardy inha|bitats, did not de&s;erve to be free, if her &s;ons could not protect their liberties without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of mercenaries, who were indeed the only &s;laves of the kingdom. Yet, among the genuine friends of their country, &s;ome individuals e&s;pou&s;ed the oppo&s;ite maxims. They ob&s;erved, that the military &s;y&s;tem of every government in Europe was now altered: that war was become a trade, and di&s;cipline a &s;cience not to be learned but by tho&s;e who made it their &s;ole pro|fe&s;&s;ion: that therefore, while France kept up a large &s;tanding army of veterans, ready to embark on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, it would be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the nation to maintain a &s;mall &s;tanding force, which &s;hould be voted in parliament from year to year. They might have &s;ugge&s;ted another expe|dient, which in a few years would have produced a militia of di&s;ciplined men. Had the &s;oldiers of this &s;mall &s;tanding army been enli&s;ted for a term of years, at the expiration of which they might have claimed their di&s;charge, volunteers would have offered them&s;elves from all parts of the kingdom, even from the de&s;ire of learning the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of arms, the ambition of being concerned in &s;cenes of actual &s;ervice, and the chagrin of little di&s;appointments or temporary di&s;|gu&s;ts, which yet would not have impelled them to enli&s;t as &s;oldiers on the com|mon terms of perpetual &s;lavery. In con&s;equence of &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the whole kingdom would &s;oon have been &s;tocked with members of a di&s;ciplined militia, equal, if not &s;uperior to any army of profe&s;&s;ed &s;oldiers. But, this &s;cheme would have defeated the purpo&s;e of the government, which was more
<PB N="179" REF="1820">
afraid of dome&s;tic foes, than of foreign enemies, and indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided every plan of this nature, which could contribute to render the malcontents of the nation more formidable.</P>

<P>Before we proceed to the tran&s;actions of parliament in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ketch the out-lines of the mini&s;try as it &s;tood at this juncture. The king's affection for the earl of Portland had begun to abate, in proportion as his e&s;teem for Sunderland increa&s;ed, together with his con&s;ideration for Mrs. Villiers, who had been di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome particular marks of his maje&s;ty's favour. The&s;e two favourites are &s;aid to have &s;upplanted Portland, who&s;e place in the king's bo|&s;om was now filled by Van K$ppel, a gentleman of Guelderland, who had fir&s;t &s;erved his maje&s;ty as a page, and afterwards acted as a private &s;ecretary. The earl of Portland growing trouble&s;ome, from his jealou&s;y of this rival, the king re&s;olved to &s;end him into honourable exile, in quality of amba$$$dor extraordi|nary to the court of France; and Tr$mbal, his friend and creature, was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from the office of &s;ecretary, which the king conferred upon Vernon, a plodding man of bu&s;ine&s;s, who had acted as u$der-&s;ecretary to the duke of Shrew&s;bury. This nobleman rivalled the earl of Sunderland in his credit at the council$board, and was &s;upported by Somers, lord-chan$ellor of England, Ru&s;&s;el, now earl of Orford, fir&s;t lord of the admiralty, and Montague, chancellor of the exchequer. Somers was an upright judge, a plau&s;ible &s;tate&s;man, a con|&s;ummate courtier, affable, mild, and in&s;inuating. Orford appears to have been rough, turbulent, factious, and &s;hallow. Montague had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf early by his poetical genius; but, he &s;oon converted his attention to the culti|vation of more &s;olid talents. He rendered him&s;elf remarkable for his eloquence, di&s;cernment, and knowledge of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. To a delicate ta&s;te, he united an eager appetite for political &s;tudies. The fir&s;t catered for the enjoy|ments of fancy: the other was &s;ub&s;ervient to his ambition. He, at the &s;ame time, was the di&s;tingui&s;hed encourager of the liberal arts, and the profe&s;&s;ed patron of projectors. In his private deportment he was liberal, ea&s;y, and enter|taining: as a &s;tate&s;man, bold, dogmatical, and a&s;piring.</P>

<P>The terrors of a &s;tanding army had produced &s;uch an univer&s;al &s;er|ment in the nation, that the dependants of the court in the hou&s;e of commons, dur&s;t not openly oppo&s;e the reduction of the forces: but, they &s;hifted the bat|tery, and employed all their addre&s;s in per&s;uading the hou&s;e to agree, that a very &s;mall number &s;hould be retained. When the commons voted, That all the forces rai&s;ed &s;ince the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and eighty, &s;hould be di&s;|$anded, the courtiers de&s;ired the vote might be recommitted, on pretence that it re&s;trained the king to the old Tory regiments, on who&s;e fidelity he could not rely. This motion, however, was over-ruled by a con&s;iderable majority. Then they propo&s;ed an amendment, which was rejected, and afterwards moved, That the &s;um of five hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum &s;hould be granted for the maintenance of guards and garri&s;ons. This provi&s;ion would have maintained a very con&s;iderable number; but, they were again di&s;appointed, and fain to em|brace a compo&s;ition with the other party, by which three hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds were allotted for the maintenance of ten thou&s;and men; and they afterwards obtained an addition of three thou&s;and marines. The king was extremely mortified at the&s;e re&s;olutions of the commons; and even declared to his particular friends, that he would never have intermeddled with the affairs of
<PB N="180" REF="1830">
the nation, had he fore&s;een they would make &s;uch returns of ingratitude and di&s;tru&s;t. His di&s;plea&s;ure was aggravated by the re&s;entment expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t Sunderland, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have advi&s;ed the unpopular mea&s;ure of retain|ing a &s;tanding army. This nobleman, dreading the vengeance of the com|mons, re&s;olved to avert the vengeance of the impending &s;torm, by re&s;igning his off$ce, and retiring from court, contrary to the intreaties of his friends, and the earne&s;t de&s;ire of his maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e of commons, in order to &s;weeten the unpalatable cup they had pre&s;ented to the king, voted the &s;um of &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum for the &s;upport of the civil li$t, di&s;tinct from all other &s;ervices. Then they pa&s;&s;ed an act, prohibiting the currency of &s;ilvered hammered coin, including a clau&s;e for making out new exchequer bills, in lieu of tho&s;e which were or might be filled up with indor&s;ements: another to open the corre&s;pon|dence with France, under variety of provi&s;os: a third for continuing the impri|&s;onment of certain per&s;ons who had been concerned in the late con&s;piracy: and a fourth, granting further time for admini&s;tring oaths with re&s;pect to tallies and orders in the exchequer, and bank of England. The&s;e bills having received the royal a&s;&s;ent, they re&s;olved to grant a &s;upply, which, together with the funds al|ready &s;ettled for that purpo&s;e, &s;hould be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer and cancel all ex|chequer bills, to the amount of two millions &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds. Another &s;upply was voted for the payment and reduction of the army, including half-pay to &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion-officers as were natural born &s;ubjects of England. They granted one million four hundred thou&s;and pounds, to make good defici|encies. They re&s;olved, That the &s;um of two millions three hundred and forty-eight thou&s;and one hundred and two pounds, was nece&s;&s;ary to pay off arrears, &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, contigencies, general-officers, guards, and garri&s;ons, of which &s;um eight hundred and fifty-five thou&s;and five hundred and two pounds, remained in the hands of the payma&s;ter. Then they took into con&s;ideration the &s;ub&s;idies due to foreign powers, and the &s;ums owing to contractors for bread and forage. Examining further the debts of the nation, they found the general debt of the navy amounted to one million three hundred and ninety-two thou&s;and, &s;even hundred and forty-two pounds. That of the ordnance was equal to two hun|dred and four thou&s;and, one hundred and fifty-&s;even pounds. The tran&s;port|debt contracted for the reduction of Ireland and other &s;ervices, did not fall &s;hort of four hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix thou&s;and, four hundred and ninety-three pounds; and they owed nine and forty thou&s;and, nine hundred and twenty-nine pounds, for quartering and cloathing the army, which had been rai&s;ed by one act of par|liament in the year &s;ixteen hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even, and di&s;banded by ano|ther in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-nine. As this enormous load of debt could not be di&s;charged at once, the commons pa&s;&s;ed a number of votes for rai&s;ing &s;ums of money, by which it was con&s;iderably lightened; and &s;ettled the funds for tho&s;e purpo&s;es by the continuation of the land-tax and other impo&s;itions. With re&s;pect to the civil li&s;t, it was rai&s;ed by a new &s;ub&s;idy of tonnage and poundage, the hereditary and temporary exci&s;e, a weekly portion from the revenue of the po&s;t-office, the fir&s;t-fruits and tenths of the clergy, the fines in the alienation$office, and po&s;t-fines, the revenue of the wine-licence, money ari&s;ing by &s;heriffs, pro&s;&s;ers, and compo&s;itions in the exchequer, and &s;eizures, the income of the dutchy of Cornwal, the rents of all other crown$lands in

England or Wales, and the duty of four and a half per cent$ upon &s;pecie from Barbadoes and the Leeward-i&s;lands. The bill imported, That the overplus ari&s;ing from the&s;e funds &s;hould be accounted for to parliament. Six hundred thou&s;and pounds of this money was allotted for the purpo&s;es of the civil li$t; the re&s;t was granted for the jointure of fifty thou&s;and pounds per annum, to be payed to queen Mary of E&s;te, according to the &s;tipulation at Ry$wick; and to maintain a court for the duke of Glouce&s;ter, &s;on of the prince&s;s Anne of Denmark, now in the ninth year of his age: but the jointure was never payed; nor would the king allow above fifteen thou&s;and pounds per annum for the u&s;e of the duke of Glouce&s;ter, to whom Burnet bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury was appointed preceptor.</P>

<P>The commons having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the ways and means for rai&s;ing the &s;upplies of the en&s;uing year, that ro&s;e almo&s;t to five millions, took cognizance of &s;ome fraudulent indor&s;ements of exchequer-bills, a &s;pecies of forgery which had been practi&s;ed by a confederacy, con&s;i&s;ting of Charles Duncomb, receiver-general of the exci&s;e; Bartholomew Burton, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a place in that branch of the revenue; John Knight, trea&s;urer of the cu&s;toms; and Reginald Marriot, a deputy-teller of the exchequer. This la&s;t turned evidence, and the proof turning out very &s;trong and full, the hou&s;e re&s;olved to make examples of the delinquents. Duncomb and Knight, both members of parliament, were ex|pelled<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Kennet. State Tracts. Burchet. Lives of the Admirals. Tindal. Ralph. Voltaire.</NOTE> and committed to the Tower; Burton was &s;ent to Newgate; and bills of pains and penalties were ordered to be brought again&s;t them. The fir&s;t, levelled at Duncomb, pa&s;&s;ed the lower-hou&s;e, though not without great oppo|&s;ition, but was rejected in the hou&s;e of lords by the majority of one voice. Duncomb, who was extremely rich, is &s;aid to have payed dear for his e&s;cape. The other two bills met with the &s;ame fate. The peers di&s;charged Duncomb from his confinement; but he was re-committed by the commons, and re|mained in cu&s;tody till the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. While the commons were em|ployed on ways and means, &s;ome of the members in the oppo&s;ition propo&s;ed, that one-fourth part of the money ari&s;ing from improper grants of the crown, &s;hould be appropriated to the &s;ervice of the public: but this was a very unpa$a|table expedient, as it affected not only the Whigs of king William's reign, but al&s;o the Tories who had been gratified by Charles II. and his brother. A great number of petitions were pre&s;ented again&s;t this mea&s;ure, and &s;o many difficulties rai&s;ed, that both parties agreed to lay it a&s;ide. In the cour&s;e of this inquiry, they di&s;covered that one Railton held a grant in tru&s;t for Mr. Mon|tague, chancellor of the exchequer. A motion was immediately made, that he &s;hould withdraw; but pa&s;&s;ed in the negative by a great majority. Far from pro&s;ecuting this mini&s;ter, the hou&s;e voted it was their opinion, That Mr. Mon|tague, for his good &s;ervices to the government, did de&s;erve his maje&s;ty's favour.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1698.</NOTE> This extraordinary vote was a &s;ure pre&s;age of &s;ucce&s;s in the execution of a &s;cheme which Montague had concerted again&s;t the Ea&s;t India company. They had been &s;ounded about advancing a &s;um of money for the public &s;ervice, by way of loan, in con&s;ideration of a parliamentary &s;ettlement; and they of|fered to rai&s;e &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds on that condition: but, before they formed this re&s;olution, another body of merchants, under the au&s;pices of Montague, offered to lend two millions at eight per cent. provided they might
<PB N="182" REF="1850">
be gratified with an exclu&s;ive priviledge of trading to the Ea&s;t Indies. This propo&s;al was very well received by the majority in the hou&s;e of commons. A bill for this purpo&s;e was brought in with additional clau&s;es of regulation. A petition was pre&s;ented by the old company, repre&s;enting their rights and claims under &s;o many royal charters; the regard due to the property of above a thou|&s;and families intere&s;ted in the &s;tock; as al&s;o to the company's property in India, amounting to forty-four thou&s;and pounds of yearly revenue. They alledged they had expended a million in fortifications: that during the war they had lo&s;t twelve great &s;hips, worth fifteen hundred thou&s;and pounds: that &s;ince the la&s;t &s;ub&s;cription they had contributed two hundred and ninety-five thou&s;and pounds to the cu&s;toms; with above eighty-five thou&s;and pounds in taxes: that they had furni&s;hed &s;ix thou&s;and barrels of gunpowder on a very pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion; and eighty thou&s;and pounds for the circulation of exchequer-bills, at a very critical juncture, by de&s;ire of the lords of the trea&s;ury, who owned that their com|pliance was a very important &s;ervice to the government. No regard being paid to their remon&s;trance, they undertook to rai&s;e the loan of two millions, and immediately &s;ub&s;cribed two hundred thou&s;and pounds as the fir&s;t payment. The two propo&s;als being compared and con&s;idered by the hou&s;e, the majority declared for the bill, which was pa&s;&s;ed and &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of lords. There the old company delivered another petition, and was heard by council; neverthele&s;s, the bill made its way, though not without oppo&s;ition, and a formal prote&s;tation by one and twenty lords, who thought it was a hard&s;hip upon the pre&s;ent company; and doubted whether the &s;eparate trade allowed in the bill, concurrent with a joint &s;tock, might not prove &s;uch an incon&s;i&s;tency as would di&s;courage the &s;ub&s;cription. This act, by which the old company was di&s;&s;olved, in a great mea&s;ure bla&s;ted the reputation of the Whigs, which had for &s;ome time been in the decline with the people. They had &s;tood up as advocates for a &s;tanding army: they now unju&s;tly &s;uper&s;eded the Ea&s;t India company: they were accu&s;ed of having robbed the public, by embezzling the national trea&s;ure, and ama&s;&s;ing wealth by u&s;urious contracts, at the expence of their fellow-&s;ubjects, groaning under the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive burthens. Certain it is, they were at this period the mo&s;t mercenary and corrupt undertakers that ever had been employed by any king or admini&s;tration &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Engli&s;h monarchy.</P>

<P>The commons now transferred their attention to certain objects in which the people of Ireland were intere&s;ted. Colonel Mitchelborne, who had been joint-governor of Londonderry with doctor Walker, during the &s;iege of that place, petitioned the hou&s;e in behalf of him&s;elf, his officers and &s;oldiers, to whom a con&s;iderable &s;um of money was due for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and the city it&s;elf implored the mediation of the commons with his maje&s;ty, that its &s;er|vices and &s;ufferings might be taken into con&s;ideration. The hou&s;e having ex|amined the allegations contained in both petitions, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, recommending the citizens of Londonderry to his maje&s;ty's favour, that they might no longer remain a ruinous &s;pectacle to all, a &s;corn to their ene|mies, and a di&s;couragement to well-affected &s;ubjects: they likewi&s;e declared, that the governor and garri&s;on did de&s;erve &s;ome &s;pecial marks of royal favour, for a la&s;ting monument to po&s;terity. To this addre&s;s the king replied, that he would con&s;ider them, according to the de&s;ire of the commons. William Moly|neux,
<PB N="183" REF="1860">
a gentleman of Dublin, having publi&s;hed a book to prove that the king|dom of Ireland was independent of the parliament of England, the hou&s;e ap|pointed a committee to enquire into the cau&s;e and nature of this performance. An addre&s;s was voted to the king, de&s;iring he would give directions for the di&s;covery and puni&s;hment of the author. Upon the report of the committee, the commons in a body pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, repre&s;enting the dangerous attempts which had been lately made by &s;ome of his &s;ubjects in Ire|land, to &s;hake off their &s;ubjection and dependence upon England; attempts which appeared not only from the bold and pernicious a&s;&s;ertions contained in a book lately publi&s;hed, but more fully and authentically by &s;ome votes and proceedings of the commons in Ireland during their la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, when they tran&s;mitted an act for the better &s;ecurity of his maje&s;ty's per&s;on and govern|ment; whereby an Engli&s;h act of parliament was pretended to be re-enacted, with alterations obligatory on the courts of ju&s;tice and the great &s;eal of Eng|land. They therefore be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to give effectual orders for pre|venting any &s;uch encroachments for the future, and the pernicious con&s;equences of what was pa&s;t, by puni&s;hing tho&s;e who had been guilty thereof: that he would take care to &s;ee the laws which direct and re&s;train the parliament of Ire|land, punctually ob&s;erved, and di&s;courage every thing which might have a ten|dency to le&s;&s;en the dependence of Ireland upon England. This remon&s;trance was graciou&s;ly received, and the king promi&s;ed to comply with their reque&s;t.</P>

<P>The jealou&s;y which the commons entertained of the government in Ireland, animated them to take other mea&s;ures, that a&s;certained the &s;ubjection of that kingdom. Under&s;tanding that the Iri&s;h had e&s;tabli&s;hed divers woollen manu|factures, they, in another addre&s;s, intreated his maje&s;ty to take mea&s;ures for di&s;couraging the woollen manufactures in Ireland, as they interfered with tho&s;e of England, and promote the linen manufacture, which would be profitable to both nations. At the &s;ame time receiving information that the French had &s;educed &s;ome Engli&s;h manufacturers, and &s;et up a great work for cloth-making in Picardy, they brought in a bill for explaining and better executing former acts for preventing the exportation of wool, fullers-earth, and &s;couring clay; and this was immediately pa&s;&s;ed into a law. A petition being pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e by the lu&s;tring company, again&s;t certain merchants who had &s;muggled alamodes and lu&s;trings from France, even during the war, the committee of trade was directed to inquire into the allegations; and all the &s;ecrets of this traffic were detected. Upon the report, the hou&s;e re&s;olved that the manufacture of alamodes and lu&s;trings &s;et up in England, had been beneficial to the king|dom: that there had been a de&s;tructive and illegal trade carried on during the war, for importing the&s;e commodities, by which the king had been defrauded of his cu&s;toms, and the Engli&s;h manufactures greatly di&s;couraged: that, by the &s;muggling ve&s;&s;els employed in this trade, intelligence had been carried into France during the war, and the enemies of the government conveyed from ju&s;tice. Stephen Seignoret Rhen&eacute; Baudoin, John Goudet, Nicholas Santini, Peter de Hear&s;e, John Pierce, John Dumaitre, and David Barreau, were im|peached at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords; and pleading guilty, the lords im|po&s;ed fines upon them according to their re&s;pective circum&s;tances. They were in the mean time committed to Newgate, until tho&s;e fines &s;hould be payed; and the commons addre&s;&s;ed the king, that the money might be appropriated to the
<PB N="184" REF="1870">
maintenance of Greenwich-ho&s;pital. The hou&s;e having taken cognizance of this affair, and made &s;ome new regulations in the pro&s;ecution of the African trade, pre&s;ented a &s;olemn addre&s;s to the king, repre&s;enting the general dege|neracy and corruption of the age, and be&s;eeching his maje&s;ty to command all his judges, ju&s;tices, and magi&s;trates, to put the laws in execution again&s;t pro|fanene&s;s and immorality. The king profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf extremely well plea&s;ed with this remon&s;trance, promi&s;ed to give immediate directions for a reforma|tion, and expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire that &s;ome more effectual provi&s;ion might be made for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing impious books, containing doctrines again&s;t the Trinity; doc|trines which abounded at this period, and took their origin from the licence and pro$$igacy of the times.</P>

<P>In the mid&s;t of &s;uch immorality, Dr. Thomas Bray, an active divine, formed a plan for propagating the go&s;pel in foreign countries. Mi&s;&s;ionaries, catechi&s;ms, liturgies, and other books for the in&s;truction of ignorant people, were &s;ent to the Engli&s;h colonies in America. This laudable de&s;ign was &s;up|ported by voluntary contribution; and the bill having been brought into the hou&s;e of commons, for the better di&s;covery of e&s;tates given to &s;uper&s;titious u&s;es, Dr. Bray pre&s;ented a petition, praying, that &s;ome part of the&s;e e&s;tates might be &s;et apart for the propagation of the reformed religion in Maryland, Virginia, and the Leeward i&s;lands. About this period, a &s;ociety for the reformation of manners was formed under the king's countenance and encouragement. Con|&s;iderable collections were made for maintaining clergymen to read prayers at certain hours in places of public wor&s;hip, and admini&s;ter the &s;acrament every Sunday. The members of this &s;ociety re&s;olved to inform the magi&s;trates of all vice and immorality that &s;hould fall under their cognizance; and with that part of the fines, allowed by law to the informer, con&s;titute a fund of charity. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion being terminated, the king, on the third day of July, prorogued the parliament, after having thanked them in a &s;hort &s;peech for the many te&s;timonies of their affection he had received; and in two days after the prorogation it was di&s;&s;olved <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the fifth day of January, a fire breaking out at Whitehall, through the carele&s;sne&s;s of a $word$ the whole body of the palace, together with the new gallery, council-chamber, and &s;e|veral adjoining apartments, was intirely con|&s;umed; but the banquetting-hou&s;e was not af|fected.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>In the month of January, the earl of Portland had &s;et out on his emba&s;&s;y to France, where he was received with very particular marks of di&s;|tinction. He made a public entry into Paris with &s;uch magnificence as is &s;aid to have a&s;toni&s;hed the French nation. He interceded for the prote&s;tants in that kingdom, again&s;t whom the per&s;ecution had been renewed with redoubled violence: he propo&s;ed that king James &s;hould be removed to Avignon, in which ca&s;e his ma&s;ter would &s;upply him with an honourable pen&s;ion: but his remon&s;trances on both &s;ubjects proved ineffectual. Lewis, however, in a pri|vate conference with him at Marli, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have communicated his pro|ject of the partition-treaty. The earl of Portland, at his return to England, finding him&s;elf totally eclip&s;ed in the king's favour, by Keppel, now created earl of Albemarle, re&s;igned his employments in di&s;gu&s;t; nor could the king's &s;ollicitations prevail upon him to re&s;ume any office in the hou&s;hold: though he promi&s;ed to &s;erve his maje&s;ty in any other &s;hape, and was &s;oon employed to
<PB N="185" REF="1880">
negotiate the treaty of partition. If this nobleman mi&s;carried in the purpo&s;es of his la&s;t emba&s;&s;y at the court of Ver&s;ailles, the agents of France were equally un&s;ucce&s;ful in their endeavours to retrieve their commerce with England, which the war had interrupted. Their commi&s;&s;ary &s;ent over to London with powers to regulate the trade between the two nations, met with in&s;uperable difficulties. The parliament had burthened the French commodities with heavy duties, which were already appropriated to different u&s;es; and the chan|nel of trade was in many re&s;pects entirely altered. The Engli&s;h merchants &s;up|plied the nation with wines from Italy, Spain, and Portugal, with linen from Holland and Sile&s;ia; and manufactures of paper, hats, &s;tuffs, and &s;ilks, had been &s;et up and &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on in England, by the French refugees.</P>

<P>By this time a ferment had been rai&s;ed in Scotland, by the oppo&s;ition and di&s;couragements their new company had &s;u&s;tained. They had employed agents in England, Holland, and Hamburgh, to receive &s;ub&s;criptions. The adventurers in England were intimidated by the mea&s;ures which had been taken in parliament again&s;t the Scotti&s;h company. The Dutch Ea&s;t India company took the alarm, and exerted all their intere&s;t to prevent their country|men from &s;ub&s;cribing; and the king permitted his re&s;ident at Hamburgh to pre&s;ent a memorial again&s;t the Scotti&s;h company, to the &s;enate of that city. The parliament of Scotland being a&s;&s;embled by the earl of Marchmont as king's commi&s;&s;ioner, the company pre&s;ented it with a remon&s;trance, containing a de|tail of their grievances, ari&s;ing from the conduct of the Engli&s;h hou&s;e of com|mons, as well as from the memorial pre&s;ented by the king's mini&s;ter at Ham|burgh, in which he actually di&s;owned the act of parliament and letters-patent which had pa&s;&s;ed in their favour, and threatened the inhabitants of that city with his maje&s;ty's re&s;entment, in ca&s;e they &s;hould join the Scots in their under|taking. They repre&s;ented, that &s;uch in&s;tances of interpo&s;ition had put a &s;top to the &s;ub&s;criptions in England and Hamburgh, hurt the credit of the com|pany, di&s;couraged the adventurers, and threatened the intire ruin of a de&s;ign in which all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable families of the nation were deeply engaged. The parliament having taken their ca&s;e into con&s;ideration, &s;ent an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, repre&s;enting the hard&s;hips to which the company had been ex|po&s;ed, explaining how far the nation in general was concerned in the de&s;ign, and intreating that he would take &s;uch mea&s;ures as might effectually vindicate the undoubted rights and privileges of the company. This addre&s;s was &s;e|conded by a petition from the company it&s;elf, praying, that his maje&s;ty would give &s;ome intimation to the &s;enate of Hamburgh, permitting the inhabitants of that city to renew the &s;ub&s;criptions they had withdrawn: that, as a gracious mark of his royal favour to the company, he would be&s;tow upon them two &s;mall frigates, then lying u&s;ele&s;s in the harbour of Burnti&s;land: and that, in con&s;ideration of the ob&s;tructions they had encountered, he would continue their privileges and immunities, for &s;uch longer time as &s;hould &s;eem rea&s;on|able to his maje&s;ty. Though the commi&s;&s;ioner was wholly devoted to the king, who had actually re&s;olved to ruin this company, he could not appea&s;e the re|&s;entment of the nation; and the heats in parliament became &s;o violent, that he was obliged to adjourn to the fifth day of November. In this interval, the directors of the company under&s;tanding from their agent at Hamburgh, that the addre&s;s of the parliament, and their own petition, had produced no effect
<PB N="186" REF="1890">
in their favour; they wrote a letter of complaint to the lord Seafield &s;ecretary of &s;tate, ob&s;erving, that they had received repeated a&s;&s;urances of the king's having given orders to his re&s;ident at Hamburgh touching their memorial; and intreating the interpo&s;ition of his lord&s;hip, that ju&s;tice might be done to the company. The &s;ecretary, in his an&s;wer, promi&s;ed to take the fir&s;t con|venient opportunity of repre&s;enting the affair to his maje&s;ty; but he &s;aid this could not be immediately expected, as the king was much engaged in the af|fairs of the Engli&s;h parliament. This declaration the directors con&s;idered, as it really was, a mere eva&s;ion, which helped to alienate the minds of that people from the king's per&s;on and government.</P>

<P>King William at this time revolved in his own mind a project of far greater con&s;equence to the intere&s;t of Europe; namely, that of &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne of Spain, which in a little time would be vacated by the death of Charles II. who&s;e con&s;titution was already exhau&s;ted. He had been lately reduced to extremity, and his &s;ituation was no &s;ooner known in France, than Lewis detached a &s;quadron towards Cadiz, with orders to inter|cept the plate fleet, in ca&s;e the king of Spain &s;hould die before its arrival. William &s;ent another fleet to protect the galleons; but it arrived too late for that &s;ervice, and the nation loudly exclaimed again&s;t the tardine&s;s of the equip|ment. His catholic maje&s;ty recovered from his di&s;order, contrary to the ex|pectation of his people; but continued in &s;uch an enfeebled and precarious &s;tate of health, that a relap&s;e was every moment apprehended. In the latter end of July, king William embarked for Holland, on pretence of enjoying a rece&s;s from bu&s;ine&s;s, which was nece&s;&s;ary to his con&s;titution. He was glad of an op|portunity to withdraw him&s;elf for &s;ome time from a kingdom in which he had been expo&s;ed to &s;uch oppo&s;ition and chagrin. But the real motives of his voyage was a de&s;ign of treating with the French king, remote from the ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e who might have penetrated into the nature of his negotiation. He had ap|pointed a regency to govern the kingdom in his ab&s;ence, and as one of the number, nominated the earl of Marlborough, who had regained his favour, and been con&s;tituted governor to the duke of Glouce&s;ter. At his maje&s;ty's de|parture, &s;ealed orders were left with the mini&s;try, directing, that &s;ixteen thou|&s;and men &s;hould be retained in the &s;ervice, notwith&s;tanding the vote of the commons, by which the &s;tanding army was limited to ten thou&s;and. He al|ledged, that the apprehen&s;ion of troubles which might ari&s;e at the death of king Charles, induced him to tran&s;gre&s;s this limitation; and he hoped, that the new parliament would be more favourable. His enemies, however, made a fre&s;h handle of this &s;tep, to depreciate his character in the eyes of the people.</P>

&s;trictly injoined &s;ecrecy. The purport of Portland's letter was imparted to the duke of Shrew&s;bury and Mr. Montague, who con&s;ulted with the chancellor and Vernon upon the &s;ubject; and the chancellor wrote an an&s;wer to the king, as the i&s;&s;ue of their joint deliberation: but, before it reached his maje&s;ty, the fir&s;t treaty of partition was &s;igned by the earl of Portland and Sir Jo&s;eph William&s;on. The contracting powers agreed, That in ca&s;e the king of Spain &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, the kingdom of Naples and Sicily, with the places de|pending on the Spani&s;h monarchy, and &s;ituated on the coa&s;t of Tu&s;cany, or the adjacent i&s;lands, the marqui&s;ate of Final, the province of Guipu&s;coa; all places on the French &s;ide of the Pyrenees, or the other mountains of Navarre, Alva, or Bi&s;cay, on the other &s;ide of the province of Guipu&s;coa, with all the &s;hips, ve&s;&s;els, and &s;tores, &s;hould devolve upon the dauphin, in con&s;ideration of his right to the crown of Spain, which, with all its other dependencies, &s;hould de&s;cend to the electoral prince of Bavaria, under the guardian&s;hip of his father: That the dutchy of Milan &s;hould be &s;ettled on the emperor's &s;econd &s;on the archduke Charles: That this treaty &s;hould be communicated to the emperor and the elector of Bavaria by the king of England and the &s;tates-ge|neral: That if either &s;hould refu&s;e to agree to this partition, his proportion &s;hould remain in &s;eque&s;tration until the di&s;pute could be accommodated: That in ca&s;e the electoral prince of Bavaria &s;hould die before his father, then the elector and his other heirs &s;hould &s;ucceed him in tho&s;e dominions; and, &s;hould the archduke reject the dutchy of Milan, they agreed that it &s;hould be &s;eque&s;tred and governed by the prince of Vaudemont. It may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that Philip IV. father to the pre&s;ent king of Spain, had &s;ettled his crown by will on the emperor's children: that the dauphin was &s;on to Maria-There&s;a, daughter of the &s;ame monarch, who&s;e right to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion Lewis had re|nounced in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner: as for the electoral prince of Bavaria, he was grand&s;on to a daughter of Spain. This treaty of partition was one of the mo&s;t impudent &s;chemes of encroachment that tyranny and inju&s;tice ever planned. Lewis, who had made a practice of &s;acrificing all ties of honour and good faith, to the intere&s;t of his pride, vanity, and ambition, fore&s;aw that he &s;hould never be able to accompli&s;h his de&s;igns upon the crown of Spain, while Wil|liam was left at liberty to form another confederacy again&s;t them. He there|fore re&s;olved to amu&s;e him with a treaty, in which he &s;hould &s;eem to act as umpire in the concerns of Europe. He knew that William was too much of a politician to be re&s;tricted by notions of private ju&s;tice; and that he would make no &s;cruple to infringe the laws of particular countries, or even the rights of a &s;ingle nation, when the balance of power was at &s;take. He judged right in this particular. The king of England lent a willing ear to his propo&s;als, and engaged in a plan for di&s;membring a kingdom, in de&s;pite of the natives, and in violation of every law human or divine.</P>

<P>In the beginning of December, the king arrived in England, where a new parliament had been cho&s;en, and prorogued on account of his maje&s;ty's ab&s;ence, prolonged by contrary winds, and tempe&s;tuous weather. His mini|&s;try had been at very little pains to influence the elections, which generally fell upon men of revolution-principles, though they do not &s;eem to have been much devoted to the per&s;on of their &s;overeign; yet their choice of Sir Thomas Lyttleton for &s;peaker, &s;eemed to pre&s;age a &s;e&s;&s;ion favourable to the mini&s;try. The two hou&s;es being convened on the &s;ixth day of December, the king, in his &s;peech, ob&s;erved, That the &s;afety, honour, and happine&s;s of the kingdom, would in a great mea&s;ure depend upon the &s;$rength which they &s;hould think proper to maintain by &s;ea and land. He de&s;ired they would make &s;ome fur|ther progre&s;s in di&s;charging the national debt, contrive effectual expedients for employing the poor, pa&s;s good bills for the advancement of trade, and the di&s;couragement of profanity; and act with unanimity and di&s;patch. The commons of this new parliament were &s;o irritated at the king's pre&s;uming to maintain a greater number of troops than their predece&s;&s;ors had voted, that they re&s;olved he &s;hould feel the weight of their di&s;plea&s;ure. They omitted the common compliment of an addre&s;s: they re&s;olved that all the forces of Eng|land, in Engli&s;h pay, exceeding &s;even thou&s;and men, &s;hould be forthwith di&s;|banded; as al&s;o tho&s;e in Ireland, exceeding twelve thou&s;and; and that tho&s;e retained &s;hould be his maje&s;ty's natural-born &s;ubjects. A bill was brought in on the&s;e re&s;olutions, and pro&s;ecuted with peculiar eagerne&s;s, to the un&s;peak|able mortification of king William, who was not only extremely &s;en&s;ible of the affront, but al&s;o particularly chagrined to &s;ee him&s;elf di&s;abled from main|taining his Dutch guards, and the regiments of French refugees, to which he was uncommonly attached. Before the meeting of the parliament, the mini|&s;try gave him to under&s;tand, that they &s;hould be able to procure a vote for ten or twelve thou&s;and; but they would not undertake for a greater number. He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf di&s;&s;atisfied with the propo&s;al, ob&s;erving, that they might as well di&s;band the whole, as leave &s;o few. The mini&s;ters would not run the ri&s;que of lo&s;ing all their credit, by propo&s;ing a greater number; and having re|ceived no directions on this &s;ubject, &s;at &s;ilent when it was debated in the hou&s;e of commons.</P>

<P>Such was the indignation of William, kindled by this conduct of his mini&s;try and his parliament, that he threatened to abandon the government; and had actually penned a &s;peech to be pronounced to both hou&s;es on that oc|ca&s;ion: but he was diverted from this purpo&s;e by his mini&s;try and confidents, and re&s;olved to pa&s;s the bill by which he had been &s;o much o&s;&s;ended. Ac|cordingly, when it was ready for the royal a&s;&s;ent, he went to the hou&s;e of peers, where having &s;ent for the commons, he told them, that although he might think him&s;elf unkindly u&s;ed, in being deprived of his guards, which had con&s;tantly attended him in all his actions, yet as he believed nothing could be more fatal to the nation, than any di&s;tru&s;t or jealou&s;y between him and his parliament, he was come to pa&s;s the bill, according to their de&s;ire. At the &s;ame time, for his own ju&s;t$$i$ation, and in di&s;charge of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, he declared, that in his judgment the nation was left too much expo&s;ed; and
<PB N="190" REF="1930">
that it was incumbent upon them to provide &s;uch a &s;trength as might be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the kingdom. They thanked him in an addre&s;s, for this un|deniable proof of his readine&s;s to comply with the de&s;ires of his parliament. They a&s;&s;ured him, he &s;hould never have rea&s;on to think the commons were un|dutiful or unkind; for, they would, on all occa&s;ions, &s;tand by, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the pre&s;ervation of his &s;acred per&s;on, and in the &s;upport of his government, again&s;t all his enemies what&s;oever. The lords pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the &s;ame effect; and the king a&s;&s;ured both hou&s;es, he entertained no doubts of their loyalty and affection. He forthwith i&s;&s;ued orders for reducing the army to the number of &s;even thou&s;and men, to be maintained in England under the name of guards and g$rri&s;ons; and, hoping the hearts of the commons were now mollified, he made another effort in favour of his Dutch guards, whom he could not di&s;mi&s;s without the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible regret. Lord Ranelagh was &s;ent with a written me&s;&s;age to the commons, giving them to under&s;tand, that the nece&s;&s;ary preparations were made for tran&s;porting the guards who came with him into England, and that they &s;hould embark immediately, unle&s;s out of con&s;ideration to him, the hou&s;e &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to find a way for continuing them longer in the &s;ervice; an expedient which his maje&s;ty would take very kindly. The commons, in&s;tead of complying with his inclination, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, in which they profe&s;&s;ed un&s;peakable grief, that he &s;hould propo&s;e any thing to which they could not con&s;ent with due regard to the con&s;titution, which he had come over to re&s;tore, and &s;o often hazarded his royal per&s;on to pre&s;erve. They reminded him of the declaration, in which he had promi&s;ed, that all the foreign forces &s;hould be &s;ent out of the kingdom. They ob&s;erved, that nothing conduced more to the happine&s;s and welfare of the nation, than an intire confidence between the king and people, which could no way be &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed as by intru&s;ting his &s;acred per&s;on with his own &s;ubjects, who had &s;o eminently &s;ignalized them&s;elves during the late long and expen&s;ive war. They received a &s;oothing an&s;wer to this addre&s;s, but remained firm to their purpo&s;e, in which the king was fain to acquie&s;ce; and the Dutch guards were tran&s;ported to Holland. At a time when they declared them&s;elves &s;o well plea&s;ed with their deliverer, &s;uch an oppo&s;ition in an affair of very little con&s;equence, &s;a|voured more of clowni&s;h ob&s;tinacy than of patrioti&s;m. In the mid&s;t of all their profe&s;&s;ions of regard, they entertained a national prejudice again&s;t him|&s;elf and all the foreigners in his &s;ervice. Even in the hou&s;e of commons his per&s;on was treated with great di&s;re&s;pect in virulent in&s;inuations. They &s;ug|ge&s;ted, that he neither loved nor tru&s;ted the Engli&s;h nation: that he treated the natives with the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable re&s;erve; and cho&s;e his confidents from the number of &s;trangers that &s;urrounded him: that, after every &s;e&s;&s;ion of parlia|ment, he retired from the kingdom, to enjoy an indolent and inglorious privacy with a few favourites. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions were certainly ture. He was ex|tremely di&s;gu&s;ted with the Engli&s;h, whom he con&s;idered as malicious, ignorant, and ungrateful, and he took no pains to di&s;gui&s;e his &s;entiments.</P>

<P>The commons having effected a di&s;&s;olution of the army, voted fif|teen thou&s;and &s;eamen, and a proportionable fleet for the &s;ecurity of the king|dom, and granted one million four hundred and eighty-four thou&s;and fifteen pounds, for the &s;ervices of the year, to be rai&s;ed by a tax of three &s;hillings in the pound upon lands, per&s;onal e&s;tates, pen&s;ions, and offices. A great number
<PB N="191" REF="1940">
of prie&s;ts and roman catholics, who had been frighted away by the revolution, were now encouraged by the treaty of Ry&s;wick to return, and appeared in all public places of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, with remarkable effrontery. The enemies of the government whi&s;pered about, that the treaty contained a &s;ecret article in favour of tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed that religion; and, &s;ome did not even &s;cruple to in&s;inuate, that William was a papi&s;t in his heart. The commons, alarmed at the number and in&s;olence of tho&s;e religioni&s;ts, de&s;ired the king, in an addre&s;s, to remove by proclamation all papi&s;ts and nonjurors, from the city of London and parts adjacent, and put the laws in execution again&s;t them, that the wicked de&s;igns they were always hatching might be effectually di&s;appointed. The king gratified them in their reque&s;t with a proclamation, which was not much regarded; but, a remarkable law was enacted again&s;t papi&s;ts in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion. The old Ea&s;t-India company, about this period, peti|tioned the lower hou&s;e, to make &s;ome provi&s;ion that their corporation might &s;ub&s;i&s;t for the re&s;idue of the term of twenty-one years, granted by his maje&s;ty's charter: that the payment of the five pounds percent$ by the late act for &s;ettling the trade to the Ea&s;t-Indies, might be &s;ettled and adju&s;ted in &s;uch a manner, as not to remain a burthen on the petitioners: and, that &s;uch further con&s;iderations might be had for their relief, and for the pre&s;ervation of the Ea&s;t-India trade, as &s;hould be thought rea&s;onable. A bill was brought in upon the &s;ubject of this petition; but rejected at the &s;econd reading. Di&s;contents had ri&s;en to &s;uch a height, that &s;ome members began to a&s;&s;ert, they were not bound to maintain<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Kennet. Lamberty. State Tracts. Tindal. Ralph.</NOTE> the votes and credit of the former parliament; and, upon this maxim would have contributed their intere&s;t towards a repeal of the act made in favour of the new company: but &s;uch a &s;cheme was of too dangerous con&s;equence to the public credit, to be carried into execution.</P>

<P>That &s;pirit of peevi&s;hne&s;s which could not be gratified with this &s;acrifice, produced an inquiry into the management of naval affairs, which was aimed at the earl of Orford, a nobleman who&s;e power gave umbrage, and who&s;e wealth excited envy. He officiated both as trea&s;urer of the navy, and lord-commi&s;&s;ioner of the admiralty, and &s;eemed to have forgot the &s;phere from which he had ri&s;en to title and office. The commons drew up an addre&s;s, com|plaining<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 169$.</NOTE> of &s;ome unimportant articles of mi&s;management in the conduct of the navy; and the carl was wi&s;e enough to avoid further pro&s;ecution, by re&s;igning his employments. On the fourth day of May the king clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion, with a &s;hort &s;peech, hinting di&s;&s;atis&s;action at their having neglected to con&s;ider &s;ome points which he had recommended to their attention; and the parliament was prorogued to the fir&s;t of June <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>About the latter end of March the earl of Warwick and lord Mohun were tried by their peers in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, for the murder of cap|tain Richard Coote, who had been killed in a midnight combat of three on each &s;ide.

<P>In Ireland nothing of moment was tran&s;acted. The parliament of that kingdom pa&s;&s;ed an act for rai&s;ing one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds, on lands, tenements, and hereditaments, to defray the expence of maintain|ing twelve thou&s;and men who had been voted by the commons of England: then the a&s;&s;embly was prorogued. A new commi&s;&s;ion afterwards arrived at Dublin, con&s;tituting the duke of Bolton, the earl of Berkley and Galway, lord-ju&s;tices of Ireland. The clamour in Scotland increa&s;ed again&s;t the mini&s;try, which had di&s;owned their company, and in a great mea&s;ure defeated the de&s;ign from which they had promi&s;ed them&s;elves &s;uch heaps of trea&s;ure. Notwith|&s;tanding the di&s;couragements to which their company had been expo&s;ed, they fitted out two of four large &s;hips which had been built at Hamburgh for their &s;ervice. They were loaded with a cargo for traffic, with &s;ome artillery and military &s;tores; and the adventurers embarking, to the number of twelve hundred, they &s;ailed from the frith of Edinburgh with &s;ome tenders, on the &s;eventeenth day of July in the preceding year. At Madera they took in a &s;upply of wine, and then &s;teered to Crab-i&s;land in the neighbourhood of St. Thomas, lying between Santa Cruz and Porto Rico. Their de&s;ign was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this little i&s;land; but, when they entered the road, they &s;aw a large tent pitched upon the &s;trand, and the Dani&s;h colours flying. Finding them&s;elves anticipated in this quarter, they directed their cour&s;e to the coa&s;t of Darien, where they treated with the natives for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their colony, and taking po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the ground, to which they gave the name of Caledonia, began to execute their plan of erecting a town under the appellation of New Edinburgh, by the direction of their council, con&s;i&s;ting of Patter&s;on the projector, and &s;ix other directors. They had no &s;ooner completed their &s;ettlement, than they wrote a letter to the king, containing a detail of their proceedings. They pretended they had received un$$ubted intelligence, that the French intended to make a &s;ettlement on that coa&s;t; and that their colony would be the means of pre|venting the evil con&s;equences which might ari&s;e to his maje&s;ty's kingdom and dominions from the execution of &s;uch a &s;cheme. They acknowledged his good|ne&s;s in granting tho&s;e privileges by which their company was e&s;tabli&s;hed; and they implored the continuance of his royal favour and protection, as they had punctually adhered to the conditions of the act of parliament and the patent they had obtained.</P>

<P>By this time, however, the king was re&s;olved to cru&s;h them effec|tually. He under&s;tood that the greater part of their provi&s;ions had been con|&s;umed before they &s;et &s;ail from Scotland, and fore&s;aw that they mu&s;t be reduced to a &s;tarving condition, if not &s;upplied from the Engli&s;h colonies. That they might be debarred of all &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he &s;ent orders to the governors of Jamaica, and the other Engli&s;h &s;ettlements in America, to i&s;&s;ue proclamations, prohibiting, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from holding any corre&s;pondence with the Scotti&s;h colony, or a&s;&s;i&s;ting it in any &s;hape, with arms, ammunition, or provi&s;ion, on pretence that they had not communicated their de&s;ign to his maje&s;ty, but had peopled Dari$n, in violation of the peace &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing between him and his allies. Their colony was, doubtle&s;s, a very dangerous incroachment upon the Spaniards, as it would have commanded the pa&s;&s;age be|tween Porto Bello and Panama, and divided the Spani&s;h empire in America. The French king complained of the inva&s;ion, and offered to &s;upply the court
<PB N="193" REF="1960">
of Madrid, with a fleet to di&s;lodge the interlopers. Colonna, marquis de Ca|nales, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at the court of London, pre&s;ented a memorial to king William, remon&s;trating again&s;t the &s;ettlement of this colony, as a mark of di&s;regard, and a breach of the alliance between the two crowns; and declaring, that his ma&s;ter would take proper mea&s;ures again&s;t &s;uch ho&s;tilities. The Scots affirmed, that the natives of Darien were a free people, whom the Spaniards had in vain attempted to &s;ubdue: that therefore they had an original and un|controvertible right to di&s;po&s;e of their own lands, part of which the company had purcha&s;ed for a valuable con&s;ideration. But, there was another cau&s;e more powerful than the remon&s;trances of the Spani&s;h court, to which this colony fell a &s;acrifice; and, that was the jealou&s;y of the Engli&s;h traders and planters. Darien was &s;aid to be a country abounding with gold, which would in a little time enrich the adventurers. The Scots were known to be an enterpri&s;ing and pertinacious people; and their harbour near Golden-i&s;land was already declared a free-port. The Engli&s;h apprehended that their planters would be allured into this new colony, by the double pro&s;pect of finding gold and plundering the Spa|niards: that the buccancers in particular would choo&s;e it as their chief re&s;idence: that the plantations of England would be de&s;erted: that Darien would become another Algiers: and, that the &s;ettlement would produce a rupture with Spain, in con&s;equence of which the Engli&s;h effects in that kingdom would be confi&s;cated. The Dutch too, are &s;aid to have been jealous of a company, which in time might have proved their competitors in their illicit commerce to the Spani&s;h main, and to have hardened the king's heart again&s;t the new &s;ettlers, whom he abandoned to their fate, notwith&s;tanding the repeated petitions and remon&s;trances of their con&s;tituents. Famine compelled the fir&s;t adventurers to quit the coa&s;t: a &s;econd recruit of men and provi&s;ions was &s;ent thither from Scotland; but, one of their &s;hips laden with provi&s;ion being burned by accident, they likewi&s;e de&s;erted the place: an|other reinforcement arrived, and being better provided than the two former, might have maintained their footing; but, they were &s;oon divided into factions that rendered all their &s;chemes abortive. The Spaniards advanced again&s;t them; when finding them&s;elves incapable of with&s;tanding the enemy, they &s;ollicited a capitulation, by virtue of which they were permitted to retire. Thus vani&s;hed all the golden dreams of the Scotti&s;h nation, which had engaged in this de&s;ign with incredible eagerne&s;s, and even embarked a greater &s;um of money than ever they had advanced upon any other occa&s;ion. They were now not only di&s;appointed in their expectations of wealth and affluence, but a great number of families was ab&s;olutely ruined by the mi&s;carriage of the de&s;ign, which they imputed &s;olely to the conduct of king William. The whole kingdom of Scot|land &s;eemed to join in the clamour that was rai&s;ed again&s;t their &s;overeign. They taxed him with double-dealing, inhumanity, and ba&s;e ingratitude, to a people who had lavi&s;hed their trea&s;ure and be&s;t blood in &s;upport of his govern|ment, and in the gratification of his ambition; and had their power been equal to their animo&s;ity, in all probability a rebellion would have en&s;ued.</P>

<P>William, mean while, enjoyed him&s;elf at Loo, where he was vi&s;ited by the duke of Zell, with whom he had long cultivated an intimacy of friend|&s;hip. During his re&s;idence in this place, the earl of Portland and the grand pen&s;ionary of Holland, frequently conferred with the French amba&s;&s;ador count Tallard, upon the &s;ubject of the Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The fir&s;t plan of the partition

being defeated by the death of the young prince of Bavaria, they found it $ece&s;&s;ary to concert another, and began a private negotiation for that purpo&s;e. The court of Spain, appri&s;ed of their intention, &s;ent a written remon&s;trance to Mr. Stanhope, the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter at Madrid, expre&s;&s;ing their re&s;entment at this unprecedented method of proceeding, and de&s;iring that a &s;top might be put to tho&s;e intrigues, &s;eeing the king of Spain would of him&s;elf take the ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;teps for pre&s;erving the public tranquillity, in ca&s;e he &s;hould die without heirs of his body. A repre&s;entation of the &s;ame kind was made to the mini|&s;ters of France and Holland; and the marquis de Canales, the Spani&s;h amba&s;|&s;ador at London, delivered a memorial to the lords-ju&s;tices, couched in the mo&s;t virulent terms, again&s;t this tran&s;action, and even appealing from the king to the parliament. This Spaniard was plea&s;ed with an opportunity to in&s;ult king William, who hated his per&s;on, and had forbid him the court, on account of his appearing covered in his maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence. The regency had no &s;ooner commu|nicated this paper to the king, than $e ordered the amba&s;&s;ador to quit the king|dom in eighteen days, and to remain within his own hou&s;e till the time of his departure. He was at the &s;ame time given to under&s;tand, that no writing would be received from him or any of his dome&s;tics. Mr. Stanhope was di|rected to complain at Madrid of the affront offered to his ma&s;ter, which he &s;tiled an in&s;olent and &s;aucy attempt to &s;tir up &s;edition in the kingdom, by ap|pealing to the people and parliament of England again&s;t his maje&s;ty. The court of Spain ju&s;tified what their mini&s;ter had done, and in their turn ordered Mr. Stanhope to leave their dominions. Don Bernardo de Quiros, the Spa|ni&s;h amba&s;&s;ador in Holland, prepared a memorial on the &s;ame &s;ubject, to the &s;tates-general; which, however, they refu&s;ed to accept. The&s;e remon&s;trances did not interrupt the negotiation, in which Lewis was &s;o eager, that he com|plained of William, as if he had not employed his whole influence in prevailing upon the Dutch to &s;ignify their acce&s;&s;ion to the articles agreed upon by France and England: but, his Britannic maje&s;ty found means to remove this jea|lou&s;y.</P>

<P>About the middle of October he returned to England, and con|ferred upon the duke of Shrew&s;bury the office of chamberlain, vacant &s;ince the re&s;ignation of Sunderland. Mr. Montague at the &s;ame period re&s;igned his &s;eat at the trea&s;ury-board, together with the chancellor&s;hip of the exchequer, either fore&s;eeing uncommon difficulty in managing a hou&s;e of commons, after they had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in ill humour, or dreading the intere&s;t of his enemies, who m$ght procure a vote, that his two places were incon&s;i&s;tent. The king opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament on the &s;ixteenth day of November, with a long &s;peech, advi&s;ing a further provi&s;ion for the &s;afety of the kingdom by &s;ea and land, and the repairs of &s;hips $nd fortifications; exhorting the commons to make good the de&s;iciencies of the funds, di&s;charge the debts of the nation, and provide the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. He recommended &s;ome good bill for the more effectual pre|venting and puni&s;hing unlawful and clande&s;tine trading; and expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire, that &s;ome method &s;hould be taken for employing the poor, which were become a burthen to the kingdom. He a&s;&s;ured them, his re&s;olutions were to countenance virtue and di&s;courage vice: and, that he would decline no difficulties and dan|gers, where the welfare and pro&s;perity of the nation might be concerned. He concluded with the&s;e words, <Q>&startq;Since then our aims are only for the general

good, let us act with confidence in one another; which will not fail, with God's ble&s;&s;ing, to make me a happy king, and you a great and flouri&s;hing people.&endq;</Q> The commons were now become wanton in their di&s;gu&s;t. Though they had received no real provocation, they re&s;olved to mortify him with their proceedings. They affected to put odious interpretations on the very harmle&s;s expre&s;&s;ion of, "Let us act with confidence in one another." In&s;tead of an addre&s;s of thanks, according to the u&s;ual cu&s;tom, they pre&s;ented a &s;ullen remon&s;trance, complaining, that a jealou&s;y and di&s;gu&s;t had been rai&s;ed of their duty and af|fection; and de&s;iring he would &s;hew marks of his high di&s;plea&s;ure towards all per&s;ons who had prefumed to mi&s;repre&s;ent their proceedings to his maje&s;ty. He declared, in his an&s;wer, that no per&s;on had ever dared to mi&s;repre&s;ent their pro|ceedings; and, that if any &s;hould pre&s;ume to impo&s;e upon him by &s;uch calum|nies, he would treat them as his wor&s;t enemies.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e was not in an humour to be appea&s;ed with &s;oothing promi&s;es and prote&s;tations: they determined to di&s;tre&s;s him, by pro&s;ecuting his mini&s;ters. During the war the colonies of North-America had grown rich by pyracy. One Kidd, the ma&s;ter of a &s;loop, undertook to &s;uppre&s;s the pyra$es, provided the government would furni&s;h him with a &s;hip of thirty guns, well manned. The board of admiralty declaring, that &s;uch a number of &s;eamen could not be &s;pared from the public &s;ervice, Kidd was equipped by the private &s;ub&s;cription of the lord-chancellor, the duke of Shrew&s;bury, the earls of Rom|ney, Orford, and Bellamont, Sir Edward Harri&s;on, and colonel Leving&s;tone of New$York. The king promi&s;ed to contribute one half of the expence, and re&s;erved to him&s;elf one tenth of the profits; but, he never advanced the money. Kidd being thus equipped, and provided with a commi&s;&s;ion to act again&s;t the French, as well as to make war on certain pyrates therein mentioned by name, &s;et &s;ail from Plymouth; but, in&s;tead of cruizing on the coa&s;t of America, di|rected his cour&s;e to the Ea&s;t Indies, where he him&s;elf turned pyrate, and took a rich &s;hip belonging to the Moors. Having divided his booty with his crew, ninety of whom left him, in order to join other adventurers, he burned his own &s;hip, and &s;ailed with his prize to the We&s;t-Indies. There he purcha&s;ed a &s;loop, in which he &s;teered for North-America, leaving part of his men in the prize to remain in one of the Leeward-i&s;lands, until they &s;hould receive further in&s;truc|tions. Arriving on the coa&s;t of New-York, he &s;ent one Emmet to make his peace with the earl of Bellamont, the governor of that province, who inveigled him into a negotiation, in the cour&s;e of which he was apprehended. Then his lord&s;hip &s;ent an account of his proceedings to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, de&s;iring, that he would &s;end for the pri&s;oners to England, as there was no law in that colony for puni&s;hing pyracy with death, and the majority of the people favour|ed that practice. The admiralty, by order of the lords-ju&s;tices, di&s;patched the &s;hip Roche&s;ter to bring home the pri&s;oners and their effects; but, after hav|ing been to&s;&s;ed for &s;ome time with tempe&s;tuous weather, this ve&s;&s;el was obliged to return to Plymouth in a &s;hattered condition; and the incident furni&s;hed the malcontents with a colour to paint the mini&s;try as the authors and abettors of a pyratical expedition, which they wanted to &s;creen from the cognizance of the public. The old Ea&s;t-India company had complained to the regency of the capture made by Kidd in the Ea&s;t-Indies, apprehending, as the ve&s;&s;el belonged to the Moors, they &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the re&s;entment of the Mogul. In the
<PB N="196" REF="1990">
beginning of December this &s;ubject was brought abruptly into the hou&s;e of commons, and a motion made, That the letters patent granted to the earl of Bellamont and others, of pyrates goods, were di&s;honourable to the king, again&s;t the law of nations, contrary to the laws and &s;tatutes of the land, inva&s;ive of property, and de&s;tructive of trade and commerce. A warm debate en&s;ued, in the cour&s;e of which, &s;ome members declamed with great bitterne&s;s again&s;t the chancellor and the duke of Shrew&s;bury, as partners in a pyratical &s;cheme; but the&s;e imputations were refuted, and the motion was rejected by a great majority. Not, but that they might have ju&s;tly &s;tigmatized the expedition as a little mean adventure, in which tho&s;e noblemen had embarked with a view to their own private advantage.</P>

<P>While this affair was in agitation among the commons, the atten|tion of the upper hou&s;e was employed upon the ca&s;e of Dr. Wat&s;on, bi&s;hop of St. David's. This prelate was &s;uppo&s;ed to have payed a valuable con&s;ideration for his bi&s;hopric; and, after his elevation, had &s;old the preferments in his gift, with a view of being reimbur&s;ed. He was accu&s;ed of &s;imony; and, after a &s;o|lemn hearing before the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and &s;ix &s;uffragans, convicted and deprived. Then he pleaded his privilege: &s;o that the affair was brought into the hou&s;e of lords, who refu&s;ed to own him as a peer after he had cea&s;ed to be a bi&s;hop. Thus di&s;appointed, he had recour&s;e to the court of delegates, by whom the archbi&s;hop's &s;entence was confirmed. The next effort that the commons made, with a view of mortifying king William, was to rai&s;e a cla|mour again&s;t Dr. Burnet, bi&s;hop of Sarum. He was repre&s;ented in the hou&s;e as a very unfit preceptor for the duke of Glouce&s;ter, both as a Scotti&s;h man, and author of that pa&s;toral letter which had been burned by order of the par|liament, for a&s;&s;erting, that William had a right to the crown from conque&s;t. A motion was made for addre&s;&s;ing his maje&s;ty, that this prelate might be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his employment, but rejected by a great majority. Burnet had acted with uncommon integrity in accepting the tru&s;t. He had declined the office, which he was in a manner forced to accept. He had offered to re&s;ign his bi&s;hopric, thinking the employment of a tutor would interfere with the duty of a pa&s;tor. He in&s;i&s;ted upon the duke's re&s;idence all the &s;ummer at Wind&s;or, which is in the dioce&s;e of Sarum; and added to his private charities the whole income of his new office.</P>

<P>The circum&s;tance on which the anticourtiers built their chief hope of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing or di&s;gracing the government, was the inquiry into the Iri&s;h for|feitures, which the king had di&s;tributed among his own dependants. The com|mi&s;&s;ioners appointed by parliament to examine the&s;e particulars, were Anne&s;ley, Trenchard, Hamilton, Langford, the earl of Drogheda, Sir Francis Brew&s;ter, and Sir Richard Leving. The fir&s;t four were actuated by all the virulence of faction: the other three were &s;ecretly guided by mini&s;terial influence. They began their inquiry in Ireland, and proceeded with &s;uch &s;everity as &s;eemed to flow rather from re&s;entment to the court, than from a love of ju&s;tice and abhor|rence of corruption. They in particular &s;crutinized a grant of an e&s;tate which the king had made to Mrs. Villiers, now counte&s;s of Orkney, &s;o as to expo&s;e his maje&s;ty's partiality for that favourite, and &s;ubject him to an additional load of popular od$$m. In the cour&s;e of their examination, the earl of Drogheda, Leving, and Brew&s;ter, oppo&s;ed the re&s;t of the commi&s;&s;ioners in divers articles of
<PB N="197" REF="2000">
the report, which they refu&s;ed to &s;ign, and &s;ent over a memorial to the hou&s;e of commons, explaining their rea&s;ons for di&s;&s;enting from their colleagues. By this time, however, they were con&s;idered as hirelings of the court, and no re|gard was payed to their repre&s;entations. The others delivered their report, de|claring, that a million and an half of money might be rai&s;ed from the &s;ale of the confi&s;cated e&s;tates; and a bill was brought in for applying them to the u&s;e of the public. A motion being made to re&s;erve a third part for the king's di&s;po|&s;al; it was over-ruled: then the commons pa&s;&s;ed an extraordinary vote, im|porting, That they would not receive any petition from any per&s;on what&s;oever concerning the grants: and, That they would con&s;ider the great &s;ervices per|formed by the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to inquire into the forfeited e&s;tates. They re&s;olved, That the four commi&s;&s;ioners who had &s;igned the report, had ac|quitted them&s;elves with under&s;tanding, courage, and integrity: and, That Sir Richard Leving, as author of groundle&s;s and &s;candalous a&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t upon his four colleagues, &s;hould be committed pri&s;oner to the Tower. They afterwards came to the following re&s;olution, which was pre&s;ented to the king in form of an addre&s;s: That the procuring and pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e grants had occa&s;ioned great debts upon the nation, and heavy taxes upon the people, and highly re|flected upon the king's honour: and, That the officers and in&s;truments con|cerned in the &s;ame, had highly failed in the performance of their tru&s;t and duty. The king an&s;wered, That he was not only led by inclination, but thought him&s;elf obliged in ju&s;tice$ to reward tho&s;e who had &s;erved well in the reduction of Ireland, out of the e&s;tates forfeited to him by the rebellion in that kingdom. He ob&s;erved, that as the long war had left the nation much in debt, their taking ju&s;t and effectual ways for le&s;&s;ening that debt, and &s;upporting pub|lic credit, was what, in his opinion, would be&s;t contribute to the honour, inte|re&s;t, and &s;afety of the kingdom. This an&s;wer kindled a flame of indignation in the hou&s;e. They forthwith re&s;olved, That the advi&s;er of it had u&s;ed his ut|mo&s;t endeavours to create a mi&s;under&s;tanding and jealou&s;y between the king and his people.</P>

<P>They prepared, fini&s;hed, and pa&s;&s;ed a bill of re&s;umption. They ordered the report of the commi&s;&s;ioners, together with the king's promi&s;e and &s;peeches, and the former re&s;olutions of the hou&s;e touching the for$eited e&s;tates in Ireland, to be printed and publi&s;hed for their ju&s;tification; and they re&s;olved, That the procuring or pa&s;&s;ing exorbitant grants by any member, now of the privy-council, or by any other that had been a privy-coun&s;ellor, in this, or any former reign, to his u&s;e or benefit, was a high crime and mi&s;demeanour. That ju&s;tice might be done to purcha&s;ers and creditors in the act of re&s;umption, thir|teen tru&s;tees were authori&s;ed and impowered to hear and determine all claims relating to tho&s;e e&s;tates, to &s;ell them to the be&s;t purcha&s;ers; and the money ari&s;ing from the &s;ale was appropriated to pay the arrears of the army. It pa&s;&s;ed under the title of a bill for granting an aid to his maje&s;ty, by the &s;ale of the forfeited and other e&s;tates and intere&s;ts in Ireland; and, that it might un|dergo no alteration in the hou&s;e of lords, it was con&s;olidated with the money|bill for the &s;ervices of the year. In the hou&s;e of lords it produced warm de|bates; and &s;ome alterations were made, which the commons unanimou&s;ly re|jected. They &s;eemed to be now more than ever exa&s;perated again&s;t the mini&s;|try, and ordered a li&s;t of the privy-council to be be layed before the hou&s;e.
<PB N="19$" REF="2010">
The lords demanded conferences, which &s;erved only to exa&s;perate the two hou&s;es again&s;t each other; for, the lords in&s;i&s;ted upon their amendments, and the commons were &s;o provoked at their interfering in a money-bill, that they de|termined to give a loo&s;e to their re&s;entment. They ordered all the doors of their hou&s;e to be &s;hut, that no members &s;hould go forth. Then they took into con&s;ideration the report of the Iri&s;h forfeitures, with the li&s;t of the privy-coun&s;el|lors; and a que&s;tion was moved, That an addre&s;s &s;hould be made to his maje&s;ty, to remove John lord Somers, chancellor of England, from hispre&s;ence and coun|cils for ever. This, however, was carried in the negative by a great majority. The king was extremely chagrined at the bill, which he con&s;idered as an in|va&s;ion of his prerogative, an in&s;ult on his per&s;on, and an injury to his friends and &s;ervants; and, he at fir&s;t re&s;olved to hazard all the con&s;equences of refu&s;ing to pa&s;s it into a law: but, he was diverted from his purpo&s;e by the remon&s;trances of tho&s;e in whom he chiefly confided. He could not, however, di&s;&s;emble his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bu$net. Oldmixon. Cole's Mem. State Tracts. Lamberty. Tindal$ Ralph.</NOTE> re&s;entment. He became fullen, peevi&s;h, and moro&s;e; and his enemies did not fail to make u&s;e of this additional ill humour, as a proof of his aver&s;ion to the Engli&s;h people. Though the motion again&s;t the chancellor had mi&s;carried, the commons re&s;olved to addre&s;s his maje&s;ty, that no per&s;on who was not a na|tive of his dominions, except his royal highne&s;s prince George of Denmark, &s;hould be admitted into his maje&s;ty's councils in England or Ireland. This re|&s;olution was levelled again&s;t the earls of Portland, Albemarle, and Galway; but, before the addre&s;s could be pre&s;ented, the king went to the hou&s;e of peers, and having pa&s;&s;ed the bill which had produced &s;uch a ferment, with &s;ome others, commanded the earl of Bridgewater, &s;peaker of the hou&s;e in the ab&s;ence of the chancellor, who was indi&s;po&s;ed, to prorogue the parliament to the twenty-third day of May.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Boiling &s;till with indig|nation again&s;t the lord-chancellor, who had turned many di&s;affected per&s;ons out of the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace, the hou&s;e ordered a bill to be prepared for qualifying ju&s;tices of the peace; and appointed a committee to in&s;pect the com|mi&s;&s;ions. This reporting, that many di&s;&s;enters, and men of &s;mall fortunes de|pending on the court, were put into tho&s;e places, the commons declared, in an addre&s;s, That it would much conduce to the &s;ervice of his maje&s;ty, and the good of this kingdom, that gentlemen of quality and good e&s;tates &s;hould be re&s;tored, and put into the commi&s;&s;ions of the peace and lieutenancy: and, that men of &s;mall e&s;tates be neither continued, nor put into the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ions. The king a&s;&s;ured them he was of the &s;ame opinion: that he would give directions accordingly. They were &s;o mollified by this in&s;tance of his conde&s;cen&s;ion, that they thanked him in a body for his gracious an&s;wer. They pa&s;&s;ed a bill to exculpate &s;uch as had neglected to &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociation, either through mi&s;take, or want of opportunity. Having received a petition from the Lanca&s;hire clergy, complaining of the in&s;olence and attempts of popi&s;h prie&s;ts, they appointed a committee to inquire how far the laws again&s;t popi&s;h refugees had been put in
<PB N="199" REF="2020">
execution; and upon the report a bill was brought in, complying with the prayer of the petition. It decreed a further reward to &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hould di&s;cover and convict popi&s;h prie&s;ts and je&s;uits; and perpetual impri&s;onment for tho&s;e convicted on the oath of one or more witne&s;&s;es. It enacted, That no per&s;on born after the twenty-fifth day of March next en&s;uing, being a papi&s;t, &s;hould be capable of inheriting any title of honour or e&s;tate within the kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed: and, That no papi&s;t &s;hould be capable of purcha&s;ing any lands, tenements, or heredita|ments, either in his own name, or in the name of any other per&s;on in tru&s;t for him. Several alterations were made in this fir&s;t draught, before it was fini&s;hed and &s;ent up to the lords, &s;ome of whom propo&s;ed amendments: the&s;e, however, were not adopted; and the bill obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent, contrary to the ex|pectation of tho&s;e who pro&s;ecuted the mea&s;ure, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the king was a favourer of papi&s;ts. After all, the bill was deficient in nece&s;&s;ary clau&s;es to enforce execution; &s;o that the law was very little regarded in the &s;equel.</P>

They, at the &s;ame time, publi&s;hed a &s;tate of their ca&s;e, in which they expatiated upon the equity of their claims, and magnified the injuries they had undergone. The new company drew up an an&s;wer to this remon&s;trance, expo&s;ing the cor|rupt practices of their adver&s;aries. But, the influence of their great patron, Mr. Montague, was now vani&s;hed: the &s;upply was not yet di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and the mi|ni&s;try would not venture to provoke the commons, who &s;eemed propitious to the old company; and actually pa&s;&s;ed a bill in their favour. This meeting with no oppo&s;ition in the upper hou&s;e, was enacted into a law, renewing their e&s;ta|bli&s;hment: &s;o that now there were two rival companies of merchants trad|ing to the Ea&s;t-Indies. The commons, not yet &s;atisfied with the vexations to which they had expo&s;ed their &s;overeign, pa&s;&s;ed a bill to appoint commi&s;|&s;ioners for taking and examining the public accounts. Another law was made, to prohibit the u&s;e of India &s;ilks and &s;tuffs which interfered with the Engli&s;h manufactures: a third, to take off the duties on the exportation of woollen manufactures, corn, grain, meal, bread, and bi&s;cuit: and a fourth, in which provi&s;ion was made for puni&s;hing governors, or commanders in chief of plantations and colonies, in ca&s;e they &s;hould commit any crimes or acts of in|ju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion in the exerci&s;e of their admini&s;tration.</P>

<P>The people of Scotland &s;till continued in violent agitation. They publi&s;hed a pamphlet, containing a detail of their grievances, which they in a great mea&s;ure a&s;cribed to his maje&s;ty. A complaint being pre|ferred to the hou&s;e of commons again&s;t this performance, it was voted a fal&s;e, &s;candalous, and traitorous libel, and ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hangman. The commons addre&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty, to i&s;&s;ue his royal proclamation for apprehending the author, printer, and publi&s;her, of the &s;aid libel; and he complied with their reque&s;t. The Scotti&s;h company had &s;ent up an addre&s;s to the king, in behalf of &s;ome adventurers who were wrongfully detained pri&s;oners in Carthagena; but lord Ba&s;il Hamilton, who undertook the charge of this petition, was refu&s;ed admittance to his maje&s;ty, on pretence of his being &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection to the government. The
<PB N="200" REF="2030">
king, however, wrote to his council for Scotland, that he would demand the enlargement of the pri&s;oners, and countenance any laudable mea&s;ure that could advance the trade of that kingdom. The directors of the company, not con|tent with this declaration, importuned their lord chancellor, who was in Lon|don, to procure acce&s;s for lord Ba&s;il Hamilton; and the mini&s;try took &s;helter from their &s;ollicitations behind a parliamentary inquiry. The &s;ubject of the Scotti&s;h colony being introduced into the hou&s;e of lords, where the mini&s;terial influence preponderated, a vehement deb$te aro&s;e, not from any regard to the intere&s;t of Scotland, but from mere oppo&s;ition to the court, which however tri|umphed in the i&s;&s;ue. A motion was made, that the &s;ettlement of the Scotch colony at Darien, was incon&s;i&s;tent with the good of the plantation-trade of England; and pa&s;&s;ed in the affirmative by a &s;mall majority. Then they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, declaring their &s;ympathy with the lo&s;&s;es of their fellow-&s;ubjects, and their opi|nion, that a pro&s;ecution of the de&s;ign mu&s;t end, not only in far greater di&s;ap|pointments to them&s;elves, but al&s;o prove very inconvenient to the trade and quiet of the kingdom. They reminded him of the addre&s;s of both hou&s;es, touching that &s;ettlement; and they expre&s;&s;ed their approbation of the orders he had &s;ent to the governors of the plantations on this &s;ubject. The king, in his an&s;wer to the addre&s;s, in which the commons refu&s;ed to concur, took the oppor|tunity of exhorting them to con&s;ider of an union between the two kingdoms, as a mea&s;ure, than which nothing could more contribute to their mutual &s;ecurity and advantage. The lords, in pur&s;uance of this advice, prepared a bill, ap|pointing certain commi&s;&s;ioners of the realm of England to treat with commi&s;&s;i|oners of Scotland for the weal of bo$h kingdoms; but, it was ob&s;tructed in the ho$&s;e of commons, who were determined to thwart every &s;tep that might tend to le&s;&s;en the di&s;gu&s;t, or appea&s;e the animo&s;ity of the Scotti&s;h nation. The mal|contents in&s;inuated, that the ki$g's oppo&s;ition to the Scotti&s;h company$ flowed neither from his regard to the intere&s;t of England, nor from his punctual ob|&s;ervance of treaties with Spain; but, &s;olely from his attachment to the Dutch, who maintained an advantageous trade from the i&s;land of Curacoa to the Spa|ni&s;h plantations in America, and were apprehe$&s;ive that the Scotti&s;h colony would deprive them of this commerce. This interpretation &s;erved as fuel to the flame already kindled in Scotland, and indu&s;triou&s;ly blown up by the ca|lumnies of the Jacobites. Their parliament adopted the company as a national concern, by voting, That the colony of Caledonia in Darien was a legal and rightful &s;ettlement, which the parliament would maintain and &s;upport. On account of this re&s;olution the &s;e&s;&s;ion was for &s;ome time di&s;continued; but, when the Sco$s under&s;tood their new &s;ettlement was totally abandoned, their capital lo&s;t, and all their hope intirely vani&s;hed, the whole nation was &s;eized with a tran&s;port of fury. They loudly exclaimed, that they had been &s;acrificed and ba$ely betrayed in that quarter where they were intitled to protection. They concerted an addre&s;s to the king, couched in a very high &s;train, repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of an immediate parliament. It was circulated about the kingdom for &s;ub&s;criptions, &s;igned by a great number of tho&s;e who &s;at in parliament, and pre&s;ented to the king by lord Ro&s;s, who with &s;ome others was deputed for that purpo&s;e. The king told them, they &s;hould know his intention in Scot|land; and in the mean time, adjourned their parliament by proclamation. The people, exa&s;perated at this new provocation, began to form the draught of a
<PB N="201" REF="2040">
&s;econd national addre&s;s, to be &s;igned by the &s;hires and boroughs of the kingdom: but, before this could be fini&s;hed, the king wrote a letter to the duke of Queen&s;|berry, and the privy council of that nation, which was publi&s;hed for the &s;ati&s;|faction of the people. He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf grieved at the nation's lo&s;s, and willing to grant what might be needful for the relief and ea&s;e of the kingdom. He a&s;&s;ured them he had their intere&s;t at heart; and that his good &s;ubjects &s;hould have convincing proofs of his &s;incere inclination to advance the wealth and pro&s;perity of that his antient kingdom. He &s;aid he hoped this declara|tion would be &s;atisfactory to all good men: that they would not &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be mi&s;led; nor give advantage to enemies, and ill-de&s;igning per&s;ons, ready to &s;eize every opportunity of embroiling the government. He gave them to under&s;tand, that his nece&s;&s;ary ab&s;ence had occa&s;ioned the late adjournment; but as &s;oon as God &s;hould bring him back, their parliament &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled. Even this explanation, &s;econded by all the credit and addre&s;s of his mini&s;ters, failed in allaying the national ferment, which ro&s;e to the very verge of rebellion.</P>

<P>The king, who, from his fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, had veered occa&s;ionally from one party to another, according to the circum&s;tances of his affairs, and the oppo&s;ition he encountered, was at this period &s;o incen&s;ed and embarra&s;&s;ed by the caprice and in&s;olence of the commons, that he willingly lent an ear to the leaders of the Tories, who undertook to manage the parlia|ment according to his plea&s;ure, provided he would part with &s;ome of his mi|ni&s;ters, who were peculiarly odious to the commons. The per&s;on again&s;t whom their anger was chiefly directed, was the lord chancellor Somers, the mo&s;t active leader of the Whig-party. They demanded his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and the king exhorted him to re&s;ign his office; but he refu&s;ing to take any &s;tep that might indicate a fear of his enemies, or a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, the king &s;ent a peremptory order for the &s;eals by the lord Jer&s;ey, to whom Somers de|livered them without he&s;itation. They were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively offered to lord chief|ju&s;tice Holt, and Trevor the attorney-general, who declined accepting &s;uch a precarious office. Mean while the king granted a temporary commi&s;&s;ion to three judges to &s;it in the court of chancery; and at length be&s;towed the &s;eals, with the title of lord-keeper, on Sir Nathan Wright, one of the &s;erjeants at law, a man but indifferently qualified for the office to which he was now pre|ferred. Though the king &s;eemed altogether attached to the Tories, and in|clined to a new parliament, no per&s;on appeared to take the lead in the affairs of government; and, indeed, for &s;ome time $word$ the admini&s;tration &s;eemed to be under no particular direction.</P>

<P>During the tran&s;actions of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, the negotiation for a &s;econd partition-treaty was carried on in London by the French mini&s;ter Tal|lard, in conjunction with the earls of Portland and Jer&s;ey, and &s;oon brought to perfection. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of February, the treaty was &s;igned in London; and, on the twenty-fifth of the next month, it was &s;ub&s;cribed at the Hague by Briord the French envoy, and the plenipotentiaries of the &s;tates ge|neral. By this convention the treaty of Ry&s;wick was confirmed. The con|tracting parties agreed, That in ca&s;e of his catholic maje&s;ty's dying without i&s;&s;ue, the dauphin &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s, for him&s;elf and his heirs, the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, the i&s;lands of St. Stephano, Porto Hercole, Orbitello, Telamone, Porto-Longone, Piombino, the city and marqui&s;ate of Final, the province

of Guipu$coa; the dutchies of Lorrain and Bar, in exchange for which the duke of Lorraine &s;hould enjoy the dutchy of Milan; but that the county of Biche &s;hould remain in &s;overe$gnty to the prince of Vaudemont: That the archduke Charles &s;hould inherit the kingdom of Spain, and all its dependencies in and out of Europe; but, in ca&s;e of his dying without i&s;&s;ue, it &s;hould de|volve to &s;ome other child of the emp$ror, excepting him who &s;hould &s;ucceed as emperor or king of the Romans: That this monarchy &s;hould never de&s;cend to a king of France or dauphin; and that three months &s;hould be allowed to the emperor, to con&s;ider whether or not he would accede to this treaty. Whether the French king was really &s;incere in his profe&s;&s;ions at this juncture, or propo&s;ed this treaty with a view to make a clande&s;tine u&s;e of it at the court of Spain for more intere&s;ted purpo&s;es, it is not ea&s;y to determine: at fir&s;t, however, it was concealed from the notice of the public, as if the parties had re&s;olved to take no &s;tep in con&s;equence of it, during the life of his catholic maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>In the beginning of July, the king embarked for Holland, after having appointed a regency to govern the kingdom in his ab&s;ence. On the twenty-ninth day of the &s;ame month, the young duke of Glouce&s;ter, the only remaining child of &s;eventeen whom the prince&s;s Anne had borne, died of a malignant fever, in the eleventh year of his age. His death was much la|mented by the greater part of the Engli&s;h nation, not only on account of his promi&s;ing talents and gentle behaviour, but al&s;o as it left the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion unde|termined, and might create di&s;putes of fatal con&s;equence to the nation. The Jacobites openly exulted in an event which they imagined would remove the chief bar to the intere&s;t of the prince of Wales; but the prote&s;tants generally turned their eyes upon the prince&s;s Sophia, electre&s;s dowager of Hanover, and grand-daughter of James I. It was with a view to concert the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that the court of Brun&s;wick now returned the vi&s;it of king William. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs in England, however, afforded a very uncomfortable pro&s;pect. The people were generally alienated from the per&s;on and government of the reigning king, upon whom they &s;eem to have furfeited. The vigour of their minds was de&s;troyed by luxury and &s;loth: the &s;everity of their morals was relaxed by a long habit of venality and corruption. The king's health began to decline, and even his faculties decayed apace. No per|&s;on was appointed to a&s;cend the throne when it &s;hould become vacant. The Jacobite faction alone was eager, vigilant, enterpri&s;ing, and elate. They di&s;|patched Mr. Graham, brother of lord Pre&s;ton, to the court of St. Germain's, immediately after the death of the duke of Glouce&s;ter: they began to be&s;tir them&s;elves all over the kingdom. A report was &s;pread, that the prince&s;s Anne had privately &s;ent a m$&s;&s;age to her father; and Britain was once more threat|ened with civil war, confu&s;ion, anarchy, and ruin.</P>

<P>In the mean time, king William was not inactive. The kings of Denmark and Poland, with the elector of Brandenburg, had formed a league to cru&s;h the young king of Sweden, by invading his dominions on dif|ferent &s;ides. The Poles actually entered Livonia, and undertook the &s;iege of Riga; while the king of Denmark having demoli&s;hed &s;ome forts in Hol&s;tein, the duke of which was connected with Sweden, inve&s;ted Tonninghen. The Swedi&s;h mini&s;ter in England demanded that a&s;&s;i&s;tance of William which
<PB N="203" REF="2060">
had been &s;tipulated in a late renewal of the antient treaty between England and Sweden. The &s;tates of Holland were &s;ollicited to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Ac|cordingly, a fleet of thirty &s;ail, Engli&s;h and Dutch, was &s;ent to the Baltic, un|der the command of Sir George Rooke, who joined the Swedi&s;h &s;quadron and bombarded Copenhagen, to which the Dani&s;h fleet had retired. At the &s;ame time, the duke of Lunenburg, with the Swedi&s;h forces which happened to be at Bremen, pa&s;&s;ed the Elbe, and marched to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the duke of Hol|&s;tein. The Danes immediately abandoned the &s;iege of Tonninghen; and a body of Saxons, who had made an irruption into the territories of the duke of Brun&s;wick, were obliged to retreat in di&s;order. By the mediation of William, a negotiation was begun for a treaty between Sweden and Denmark, which, in order to quicken, Charles the young king of Sweden made a de&s;cent upon the i&s;le of Zealand. This was executed with great &s;ucce&s;s. Charles was the fir&s;t man who landed; and here he exhibited &s;uch marks of courage and conduct, far above his years, as equally a&s;toni&s;hed and intimidated his adver&s;aries. Then he determined to be&s;iege Copenhagen; a re&s;olution which &s;truck &s;uch terror into the Danes, that they proceeded with redoubled diligence in the treaty, which was brought to a conclu&s;ion, between Denmark, Sweden, and Hol&s;tein, about the middle of Augu&s;t. Then the Swedes retired to Schonen, and the &s;quadrons of the maritime powers returned from the Baltic.</P>

<P>When the new partition$treaty was communicated by the mini|&s;ters of the contracting parties to the other powers of Europe, it generally met with a very unfavourable con&s;truction. Saxony and the northern crowns were &s;till embroiled with their own quarrels, con&s;equently could not give much at|tention to &s;uch a remote tran&s;action. The princes of Germany appeared cautious and dilatory in their an&s;wers, unwilling to be concerned in any plan that might excite the re&s;entment of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The elector of Brandenburg, in particular, had &s;et his heart upon the regal dignity, which he hoped to ob|tain from the favour and authority of the emperor. The Italian &s;tates were aver&s;e to the partition-treaty, from their apprehen&s;ion of &s;eeing France in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Naples, and other di&s;tricts of their country. The duke of Savoy af|fected a my&s;terious neutrality, in hope of being able to barter his con&s;ent for &s;ome con&s;iderable advantage. The Swi&s;s cantons declined acceding as gua|rantees. The emperor expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hment that any di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould be made of the Spani&s;h monarchy, without the con&s;ent of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and the &s;tates of the kingdom. He ob&s;erved, that neither ju&s;tice or decorum could warrant the contracting powers to compel him, who was the rightful heir, to accept a part of his inheritance within three months, under penalty of for|feiting even that &s;hare to a third per&s;on not yet named; and he declared, that he could take no final re&s;olution, until he &s;hould know the &s;entiments of his catholic maje&s;ty, on an affair in which their mutual intere&s;t was &s;o nearly con|cerned. Leopold was actually engaged in a negotiation with the king of Spain, who &s;igned a will in favour of his &s;econd &s;on Charles; yet he took no mea&s;ures to &s;upport the di&s;po&s;ition, either by &s;ending the archduke with a $uf|ficient force into Spain, or by detaching troops into Italy.</P>

<P>The people of Spain were exa&s;perated at the in&s;olence of the three foreign powers who pretended to parcel out their dominions. Their pride took the alarm, at the pro&s;pect of their monarchy's being di&s;membered; and the
<PB N="204" REF="2070">
g$andees repined at the thought of lo&s;ing &s;o many lucrative governments, which they now enjoyed. The king's life became every day more and more precarious, from frequent returns of his di&s;order. The mini&s;try was weak and divided, the nobi$ity factious, and the people di&s;contented. The hearts of the nation had been alienated from the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, by the in&s;olent carriage and rapacious di&s;po&s;ition of the queen Mariana. The French had gained over to their intere&s;ts the cardinal Portocarrero, the marquis de Monterey, with many other noblemen and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The&s;e perceiving the &s;$ntiments of the people, employed their emi&s;&s;aries to rai&s;e a general cry that France alone could maintain the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion intire; that the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria was $eeble and exhau&s;ted, and any prince of that line mu&s;t owe his chief &s;up|port to dete&s;table heretics. Portocarrero tampered with the weakne&s;s of his &s;overeign. He repeated and exaggerated all the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions: he advi&s;ed him to con&s;ult his holine&s;s pope Innocent XII. on this momentous point of regu|lating the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. That pontiff, who was a creature of France, having taken the advice of a college of cardinals, determined, that the renunciation of Maria There&s;a, was invalid and null, as being founded upon compul&s;ion, and contrary to the fundamental laws of the Spani&s;h $$narchy. He therefore exhorted king Charles to contribute to the propagation of the faith, and the repo&s;e of Chri&s;tendom, by making a new will in favour of a grand&s;on of the French monarch. This admonition was &s;econded by the remon&s;trances of Portocarrero; and the weak prince complied with the propo&s;al. In the mean time, the king of France &s;eemed to act heartily, as a principal in the treaty of partition. His mini&s;ters at foreign courts co-operated with tho&s;e of the mari|time powers, in &s;olliciting the acce&s;&s;ion of the different powers in Europe. When count Zinzendorf, the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, pre&s;ented a me|morial, de&s;iring to know what part France would act, &s;hould the king of Spain voluntarily place a grand&s;on of Lewis upon the throne, the marquis de Torcy an&s;wered in writing, that his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty would by no means li&s;ten to &s;uch a propo&s;al: nay, when the emperor's mini&s;ter gave them to under|&s;tand that his ma&s;ter was ready to begin a &s;eparate negotiation with the court of Ver&s;ailles touching the Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, Lewis declared he could not treat on that &s;ubject without the concurrence of his allies.</P>

<P>The nature of the partition-treaty was no &s;ooner known in England, than condemned by the mo&s;t intelligent part of the nation. They fir&s;t of all complained, that &s;uch an important affair &s;hould be concluded with|out the advice of parliament. They ob&s;erved, that the &s;cheme was unju&s;t, and the execution of it hazardous: that, in concerting the terms, the maritime powers &s;eemed to have acted as parti&s;ans of France; for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Naples and the Tu&s;can ports would &s;ubject Italy to her dominion, and inter|fere with the Engli&s;h trade to the Levant and Mediterranean; while Guipu&s;|coa, on any future rupture, would afford another inlet into the heart of the Spani&s;h dominions: they, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, pronounced the treaty de&s;tructive of the balance of power, and prejudicial to the intere&s;t of England. All the&s;e arguments were trumpeted by the malcontents, &s;o that the whole kingdom echoed with the clamour of di&s;affection; while Sir Chri&s;topher Mu&s;grave, and others of the Tory faction, began to think in earne&s;t of e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h crown upon the per&s;on of the prince of Wales. They
<PB N="205" REF="2080">
are &s;aid to have &s;ent over Mr. Graham to St. Germain's with overtures to this purpo&s;e, and an a&s;&s;urance that a motion would be made in the hou&s;e of com|mons, to pa&s;s a vote that the crown &s;hould not be &s;upported in the execution of the partition-treaty. King William was not ignorant of the cen&s;ure he had undergone, and not a little alarmed to find him&s;elf &s;o unpopular among his own &s;ubjects. That he might be the more able to be&s;tow his attention effectually upon the affairs of England, he re&s;olved to take &s;ome mea&s;ures for the &s;ati&s;|faction of the Scotti&s;h nation. He permitted the parliament of that kingdom to meet on the twenty-eighth day of October, and wrote a letter to them from his hou&s;e at Loo, containing an a&s;&s;urance that he would concur in every thing that could be rea&s;onably propo&s;ed for maintaining and advancing the peace and welfare of their kingdom. He promi&s;ed to give his royal a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch acts as they &s;hould frame for the better e&s;tabli&s;hment of the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline, for preventing the growth of popery, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing vice and immorality, encourag|ing pi$ty and virtue, pre&s;erving and &s;ecuring per&s;onal liberty, regulating and advancing trade, retrieving the lo&s;&s;es, and promoting the intere&s;t of their African and Indian companies. He expre&s;&s;ed his concern that he could not a&s;&s;ert the company's right of e&s;tabli&s;hing a colony at Darien, without di&s;turb|ing the peace of Chri&s;tendom, and entailing a ruinous war on that his ancient kingdom. He recommended unanimity and di&s;patch in rai&s;ing competent taxes for their own defence; and told them he had thought fit to continue the duke of Queen&s;berry in the office of high-commi&s;&s;ioner. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;oothing addre&s;s, the national re&s;entment continued to rage, and the parlia|ment &s;eemed altogether intractable. By this time the company had received certain tidings of the intire &s;urrender of their &s;ettlement; and, on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, they repre&s;ented to parliament, that for want of due protectio$ abroad, &s;ome per&s;ons had been encouraged to break in upon their privileges even at home. This remon&s;trance was &s;ucceeded by another national addre&s;s to the king, who told them he could not take any further notice of that affair, &s;ince the parliament was now a&s;&s;embled; and he had already made a declara|tion, with which he hoped all his faithful &s;ubjects would be &s;atisfied. Never|thele&s;s, he found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to practi&s;e other expedients for allaying the ferment of that nation. His mini&s;ters and their agents be&s;tirred them|&s;elves &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that the heats in parliament were entirely cooled, and the outcry of the people &s;ub&s;ided into unavailing murmurs. The parliament re&s;olved, That in con&s;ideration of their great deliverance by his maje&s;ty; and in that, next under God, their &s;afety and happine&s;s wholly depended on his pre&s;ervation and that of his government, they would &s;upport both to the ut|mo&s;t of their power, and maintain &s;uch forces as &s;hould be requi&s;ite for tho&s;e ends. They pa&s;&s;ed an act for keeping on foot three thou&s;and men for two years, to be maintained by a land-tax. Then the commi&s;&s;ioner produced the king's letter, de&s;iring to have eleven hundred men on his own account to the fir&s;t day of June following: they forthwith complied with his reque&s;t, and were prorogued to the &s;ixth of May. The &s;upernumerary troops were &s;ent over to the &s;tates-general; and the earl of Argyle was honoured with the title of duke, as a recompence for having concurred with the commi&s;&s;ioner in ma|naging this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament.</P>

<P>King William had returned to England on the eighteenth day of October, not a little chagrined at the perplexities in which he found him&s;elf involved; and, in the beginning of the next month, he received advice that the king of Spain was actually dead. He could not be &s;urpri&s;ed at this event, which had been &s;o long expected; but it was attended with a circum&s;tance which he had not fore&s;een. Charles, by his la&s;t will, had declared the duke of Anjou, &s;econd &s;on of the dauphin, the &s;ole heir of the Spani&s;h monarchy. In ca&s;e this prince &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, or inherit the crown of France, he willed that Spain &s;hould devolve to the duke of Berry, in default of him and children, to the archduke Charles and his heirs, failing of whom, to the duke$of Savoy and his po&s;terity. He likewi&s;e recommended a match between the duke of Anjou and one of the archdutche&s;&s;es. When this te&s;tament was fir&s;t notified to the French court, Lewis &s;eemed to he&s;itate between his incli|nation and engagements to William and the &s;tates-general. Madam de Main|tenon is &s;aid to have joined her influence to that of the dauphin, in per&s;uading the king to accept of the will; and Pontchartrain was engaged to &s;upport the &s;ame mea&s;ure. A cabinet-council was called in her apartment. The re&s;t of the mini&s;try declared for the treaty of partition: the king affected a kind of neu|trality. The dauphin &s;poke for his &s;on, with an air of re&s;olution he had never a&s;&s;umed before: Pontchartrain &s;econded his arguments: Madam de Maintenon a&s;ked what the duke of Anjou had done to provoke the king, that he &s;hould be barred of his right to that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? Then the re&s;t of the mem|bers e&s;pou&s;ed the dauphin's opinion; and the king owned him&s;elf convinced by their rea&s;ons. In all probability the deci&s;ion of this council was previou&s;ly &s;ettled in private. After the will was accepted, Lewis clo&s;etted the duke of Anjou, to whom he &s;aid, in pre&s;ence of the marquis des Rios, <Q>&startq;Sir, the king of Spain has made you a king. The grandees demand you; the people wi&s;h for you, and I give my con&s;ent Remember only, you are a prince of France. I recommend to you to love your people, to gain their affection by the lenity of your government, and render your&s;elf worthy of the throne you are going to a&s;cend.&endq;</Q> The new monarch was congratulated on his ele|vation by all the princes of the blood: neverthele&s;s, the duke of Orleans and his &s;on prote&s;ted again&s;t the will, becau&s;e the archduke was placed next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the duke of Berry, in bar of their right as de&s;cendants of Anne of Au&s;tria, who&s;e renunciation could be of no more force than that of Maria-There&s;a. On the fourth day of December, the new king &s;et out for Spain, to the frontiers of which he was accompanied by his two brothers.</P>

<P>When the will was accepted, the French mini&s;ter de Torcy endeavoured to ju&s;tify his ma&s;ter's conduct to the earl of Manche&s;ter, who re|f$ded at Paris in the character of amba&s;&s;ador from the court of London. He ob&s;erved, That the treaty of partition was not likely to an&s;wer the ends for which it had been concerted: That the emperor had refu&s;ed to accede: That it was reli&s;hed by none of the princes to whom it had been communicated: That the people of England and Holland had expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;content at the pro|&s;pect of France's being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Naples and Sicily: That if Lewis had rejected the will, the archduke would have had a double title, derived from the former will, and that of the late king: That the Spaniards were &s;o aver&s;e to the divi&s;ion of their monarchy, there would be a nece&s;&s;ity for conquering the
<PB N="207" REF="2100">
whole kingdom before the treaty could be executed: That the &s;hips to be fur|ni&s;hed by Great Britain and Holland would not be &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of &s;uch a war; and it was doubtful whether England and the &s;tates-general would engage them&s;elves in a greater expence. He concluded with &s;aying, That the treaty would have been more advantageous to France than the will, which the king accepted purely from a de&s;ire of pre&s;erving the peace of Europe. His ma&s;ter hoped therefore the good under&s;tanding would &s;ub&s;i&s;t between him and the king of Great Britain. The &s;ame rea&s;ons were communicated by Briord the French amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, to the &s;tates-general, who ordered their envoy at Paris to deliver a memorial to the French king, expre&s;&s;ing their &s;urprize at his having accepted the will; and their hope, that as the time &s;pe|cified for the emperor's acceding to the treaty was not expired, his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty would take the affair again into his con&s;ideration, and adhere to his engagements in every article. Lewis, in his an&s;wer to this memorial, which he di&s;patched to all the courts of Europe, declared, That what he chiefly con|&s;idered was the principal de&s;ign of the contracting parties, namely, the main|tenance of peace in Europe; and that, true to this principle, he only departed from the words, that he might the better adhere to the &s;pirit of the treaty.</P>

<P>With this an&s;wer he &s;ent a letter to the &s;tates, giving them to under&s;tand, that the peace of Europe was &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the will of the king of Spain, in favour of his grand&s;on, that he did not doubt their ap|probation of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Spani&s;h crown. The &s;tates ob&s;erved, That they could not declare them&s;elves upon an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence, without con&s;ulting their re&s;pective provinces. Lewis admitted the excu&s;e, and a&s;&s;ured them of his readine&s;s to concur with whatever they &s;hould de&s;ire for the &s;ecurity of the Spani&s;h Netherlands. The Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague pre&s;ented them with a letter from his new ma&s;ter, who likewi&s;e notified his acce&s;&s;ion to all the powers of Europe, except the king of England. The emperor loudly exclamed again&s;t the will, as being more iniquitous than the treaty of parti|tion; and threatened to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice by force of arms. The Spaniards apprehending that a league would be formed between his Imperial maje&s;ty and the maritime powers, for &s;etting a&s;ide the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the duke of Anjou; and, con&s;cious of their own inability to defend their dominions, re&s;igned them|&s;elves intirely to the protection of the French monarch. The towns in the Spani&s;h Netherlands and the dutchy of Milan admitted French garri&s;ons: a French &s;quadron anchored in the port of Cadiz, and another was detached to the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in the We&s;t Indies. Part of the Dutch army that was quartered in Luxemburg, Mons, and Namur, were made pri&s;oners of war, becau&s;e they would not own the king of Spain, whom their ma&s;ters had not yet acknowledged. The &s;tates were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation by this event, e&s;pecially when they con&s;idered their own naked &s;ituation, and reflected that the Spani&s;h garri&s;ons might fall upon them before they could a&s;&s;emble a body of troops for their defence. The danger was &s;o imminent, that they re|&s;olved to acknowledge the king of Spain without further he&s;itation, and wrote a letter to the French king for that purpo&s;e: this was no &s;ooner received, than orders were i&s;&s;ued for &s;ending back their battalions.</P>

<P>How warmly &s;oever king William re&s;ented the conduct of the French king, in accepting the will &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to his engagements,
<PB N="208" REF="2110">
he di&s;&s;embled his chagrin, and behaved with &s;uch re&s;erve and apparent indifference, that &s;ome people naturally believed he had been privy to the tran&s;action. Others imagined that he was di&s;couraged from engaging in a new war by his bo$$ly infirmities, which daily encrea&s;ed; and the oppo&s;ition in par|liament, to which he &s;hould be inevitably expo&s;ed. But his real aim was to conceal his &s;entiments, until he &s;hould have &s;ounded the opinions of other powers in Europe, and &s;een how far he could depend upon his new mini&s;try. He now &s;eemed to repo&s;e his chief confidence in the earl of Roche&s;ter, who had undertaken for the Tories, and was declared lord-lieutenant of Ireland. Lord Godolphin was appointed fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea&s;ury: lord Tankerville &s;ucceeded lord Lon&s;dale lately decea&s;ed, as keeper of the privy-&s;eal, and Sir Charles Hedges was declared &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in the room of the earl of Jer&s;ey: but the management of the commons was intru&s;ted to Mr. Robert Harley, who had hitherto oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures of the court with equal viru|lence and ability. The&s;e new undertakers well knowing they &s;hould find it very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;ecure a majority i$ the pre&s;ent parliament, prevailed on the king to di&s;&s;olve it by proclamation; then the &s;heriffs were changed according to their nomination, and writs i&s;&s;ued for a new parliament to meet on the &s;ixth day of February. During this interval, count Wrati&s;law arrived in England, as amba&s;&s;ador from the emperor, to explain Leopold's title to the Spani&s;h monarchy, &s;upported by repeated intails and renunciations, confirmed in the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties. This mini&s;ter met with a very cold re|ception from tho&s;e who &s;tood at the helm of affairs. They &s;ought to avoid all connexions that might engage their country as a principal, in another war upon the continent, &s;marting as they were from the lo&s;&s;es and incumbrances which the la&s;t had intailed upon them and their po&s;terity. They &s;eemed to think that Lewis, rather than involve him&s;elf in fre&s;h troubles, would give all the &s;ecu|rity that could be de&s;ired for maintaining the peace of Europe; or even &s;hould this be refu&s;ed, they &s;aw no rea&s;on for Britain's exhau&s;ting her wealth and &s;trength to &s;upport a chimerical balance, in which her intere&s;t was but remotely concerned. It was their opinion, that by keeping aloof, &s;he might render her|&s;elf more re&s;pectable. Her re&s;erve would overawe contending powers: they would in their turns &s;ue for her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and implore her good offices; and, in&s;tead of declaring her&s;elf a party, &s;he would have the honour to decide as arbitre&s;s of their di&s;putes. Perhaps they extended this idea too far; and, in all probability, their notions were inflamed by a &s;pirit of faction. They hated the Whigs as their political adver&s;aries, and dete&s;ted the war, becau&s;e it had been countenanced and &s;upported by the intere&s;t of that party. The king believed, that a conjunction of the two monarchies of France and Spain would prove fatal to the liberties of Europe; and that this could not be prevented by any other method than a general union of the other European powers. He certainly was an enthu&s;ia&s;t in his &s;entiments of this equilibrium; and fully convinced that he him&s;elf, of all the potentates in Chri&s;tendom, was the only prince capable of adju&s;ting the balance. The Imperial amba&s;&s;ador could not therefore be long ignorant of his real purpo&s;e, as he conver&s;ed with the Dutch favourites, who knew and approved of their ma&s;ter's de&s;ign, though he avoided a declaration, until he &s;hould have rendered his mini&s;ters more propitious to his aim. The true &s;ecret, however, of that re&s;erve with which
<PB N="209" REF="2120">
count Wrati&s;law was treated at his fir&s;t arrival, was a private negotiation which the king had &s;et on foot with the regency of Spain, touching a barrier in the Netherlands. He propo&s;ed, that certain towns &s;hould be garri&s;oned with Engli&s;h and Dutch troops, by way of &s;ecurity again&s;t the ambitious de|&s;igns of France; but the regency were &s;o devoted to the French intere&s;t, that they refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to any propo&s;al of this nature. While this affair was in agitation, William re&s;olved to maintain a wary di&s;tance from the emperor; but, when his effort mi&s;carried, the amba&s;&s;ador found him much more open and acce&s;&s;ible <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a glorious victory which the young king of Sweden ob|tained in the nineteenth year of his age. Riga continued inve&s;ted by the king of Poland, while Peter the czar of Mu&s;$ovy made his approaches to Narva, at the head of a prodigious army, purpo&s;ing, in violation of all faith and ju&s;tice, to &s;hare the &s;poils of the youthful monarch. Charles landed at Revel, compelled the Saxons to abandon the &s;iege of Riga, and having &s;up|plied the place, marched with a handful of troops again&s;t the Mu&s;covites, who had undertaken the &s;iege of N$$va. The czar quitted his army with &s;ome precipitation, as if he had been afraid of hazarding his per&s;on, while Charles advanced through ways that were thought impracticable, and &s;urpri&s;ed the enemy. He broke into their camp before they had the lea&s;t intimation of his approach, and totally routed them, after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance. He took a great number of pri&s;oners, with all their baggage, tents, and artillery, and entered Narva in triumph.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The parliament meeting on the &s;ixth, was prorogued to the tenth day of February, when Mr. Harley was cho&s;en &s;peaker by a great majority, in oppo&s;ition to Sir Richard On&s;low. The king had previou&s;ly told Sir Tho|mas Lyttleton, it would be for his &s;ervice that he &s;hould yield his preten&s;ions to Harley at this juncture; and that gentleman agreed to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from the hou&s;e on the day of election. The king ob&s;erved, in his &s;peech, That the nation's lo&s;s in the death of the duke of Glouce&s;ter had rendered it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary for them to make further provi&s;ion for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the prote&s;tant line: That the death of the king of Spain had made &s;uch an alteration in the affairs of the continent, as required their ma$$re deli|beration. The re&s;t of his harrangue turned upon the u&s;ual topics of demand|ing &s;upplies for the en&s;uing year, reminding them of the deficiencies and public debts, recommending to their inquiry the &s;tate of the navy and fortifications; exhorting them to encourage commerce, employ the poor, and proceed with vigour and unanimity in all their deliberations. Though the elections had been generally carried in favour of the Tory intere&s;t, the mini&s;try had &s;ecured but one part of that faction. Some of the mo&s;t popular leaders, &s;uch as the duke of Leeds, the marquis of Normanby, the earl of Nottingham, Seymour, Mu&s;grave, How, Finch, and Showers, had been either neglected or found re|fractory, and re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the court-mea&s;ures with all their influence. Be&s;ides, the French king knowing that the peace of Europe would in a great mea&s;ure depend on the re&s;olutions of the Engli&s;h parliament, is &s;aid to have di&s;tributed great &s;ums of money in England, by means of his mini&s;ter Tallard, in order to &s;trengthen the oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of commons. Certain it is, the nation abounded at this period with the French coins called Louis d'or and pi&s;toles; but whether this redundancy was owing to a balance of trade in fa|vour of England, or to the large&s;&s;es of Lewis, we &s;hall not pretend to deter|mine. We may likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that the infamous practice of bribing electors had never been &s;o flagrant as in the choice of repre&s;entatives for this parliament.
<PB N="210" REF="2130">
The &s;candalous traffic had been chiefly carried on by the Whig-party, and there|fore their antagoni&s;ts re&s;olved to &s;pare no pains in detecting their corruption. Sir Edward Seymour di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his zeal and activity, brought &s;ome of the&s;e practices to light, and, in particular, &s;tigmatized the new Ea&s;t-India company, for having been deeply concerned in this &s;pecies of venality. An inquiry being &s;et on foot in the hou&s;e of commons, &s;everal elections were declared void; and, divers per&s;ons who had been illegally returned, were fir&s;t expelled the hou&s;e, and afterwards detained in pri&s;on. Yet the&s;e pro&s;ecutions were carried on with &s;uch partiality as plainly indicated that they flowed rather from party-zeal than from patrioti&s;m.</P>

<P>A great body of the commons had re&s;olved to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, de&s;iring he would acknowledge the king of Spain; and the motion, in all probability, would have been carried by a con&s;iderable majority, had not one hold and lucky expre&s;&s;ion given &s;uch a turn to the debate, as induced the anti|courtiers to de&s;i&s;t. One Mr. Monkton, in the heat of his declamation again&s;t this mea&s;ure, &s;aid, he expected the next vote would be for owning the pretended prince of Wales. Though there was little or no connexion between the&s;e two &s;ubjects, a great many members were &s;tartled at the in&s;inuation, and de&s;erted the mea&s;ure, which was dropped accordingly. The king's &s;peech being taken into con&s;ideration, the hou&s;e re&s;olved to &s;upport his maje&s;ty and his govern|ment; to take &s;uch effectual mea&s;ures as might be&s;t conduce to the intere&s;t and &s;afety of England, and the pre&s;ervation of the prote&s;tant religion. This re&s;o|lution was pre&s;ented in an addre&s;s to the king, who received it favourably. At the &s;ame time, he layed before them a memorial he had received from the &s;tates-general, and de&s;ired their advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the points that con&s;ti|tuted the &s;ub&s;tance of this remon&s;trance. The &s;tates gave him to under&s;tand, that they had acknowledged the duke of Anjou as king of Spain: that France had agreed to a negotiation, in which they might &s;tipulate the nece&s;&s;ary condi|tions for &s;ecuring the peace of Europe; and, that they were firmly re&s;olved to do nothing without the concurrence of his maje&s;ty and their other allies. They, therefore, begged he would &s;end a mini&s;ter to the Hague, with nece&s;&s;ary powers and in&s;tructions to co-operate with them in this negotiation; and, in ca&s;e it &s;hould prove ineffectual, or Holland be &s;uddenly invaded by the troops which Lewis had ordered to advance towards their frontiers, they relied on the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of England, and hoped his maje&s;ty would prepare the &s;uccours &s;tipulated by treaty, to be u&s;ed, &s;hould occa&s;ion require. The memorial was likewi&s;e com|municated to the hou&s;e of lords. Mean while the commons de&s;ired, that the treaties between England and the &s;tates-general &s;hould be layed before their hou&s;e. The&s;e being peru&s;ed, they re&s;olved upon an addre&s;s, to de&s;ire his maje&s;ty would enter into &s;uch negotiations with the &s;tates-general and other potentates, as might mo&s;t effectually conduce to the mutual &s;afety of Great-Britain and the United-Provinces, as well as to the pre&s;ervation of the peace of Europe; and to a&s;&s;ure him of their &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in performance of the treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between England and the &s;tates-general. This re&s;olution, however, was not carried without great oppo&s;ition from tho&s;e who were aver&s;e to the nation's involving it&s;elf in another war upon the continent. The king profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf extremely well plea&s;ed with this addre&s;s, and told them he would immediately order his

<P>He communicated to the commons a letter written by the earl of Melfort to his brother the earl of Perth, governor to the pretended prince of Wales. It had been mi&s;layed by accident, and came to London in the French mail. It contained a &s;cheme for another inva&s;ion of England, together with &s;ome reflections upon the character of the earl of Middleton, who had &s;upplanted him at the court of St. Germain's. Melfort was a mere projector, and &s;eems to have had no other view than that of recommending him&s;elf to king James, and bringing his rival into di&s;grace. The hou&s;e of lords, to whom the letter was al&s;o imparted, ordered it to be printed, and next day pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, thanking his maje&s;ty for his care of the prote&s;tant religion; de&s;iring all the trea|ties made &s;ince the la&s;t war might be layed before them; reque&s;ting him to en|gage in &s;uch alliances as he &s;hould think proper for pre&s;erving the ballance of power in Europe; a&s;&s;uring him of their concurrence; expre&s;&s;ing their acknow|ledgment for his having communicated Melfort's letter; de&s;iring he would give order for &s;eizing the hor&s;es and arms of di&s;affected per&s;ons; for removing pa|pi&s;ts from London; and for &s;earching after tho&s;e arms and provi&s;ions of was mentioned in the letter: finally, they reque&s;ted him to equip &s;peedily a &s;ufficient fleet for the defence of him&s;elf and his kingdom. They received a gracious an&s;wer to this addre&s;s, which was a further encouragement to the king to put his own private de&s;igns in execution; and towards the &s;ame end the letter contri|buted not a little, by inflaming the fears and re&s;entment of the nation again&s;t France, which in vain di&s;claimed the earl of Melfort as a fanta&s;tical &s;chemer, to whom no regard was payed at the court of Ver&s;ailles. The French mini&s;try complained of the publication of this letter, as an attempt to &s;ow jealou&s;ies be|tween the two crowns; and, as a convincing proof of their &s;incerity, bani&s;hed the earl of Melfort to Angers.</P>

<P>The credit of exchequer bills was &s;o lowered by the change of the mini&s;try, and the lap&s;e of the time allotted for their circulation, that they fell near twenty per cent to the prejudice of the revenue, and the di&s;credit of the government in foreign countries. The commons having taken this affair into con&s;ideration, voted, That provi&s;ion &s;hould be made from time to time for making good the principal and intere&s;t due on all parliamentary funds; and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed a bill for renewing the bills of credit, commonly called Ex|chequer bills. This was &s;ent up to the lords on the &s;ixth day of March, and on the thirteenth received the royal a&s;&s;ent. The next object that engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the commons was the &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne, which the king had recommended to their con&s;ideration in the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. Having deliberated on this &s;ubject, they re&s;olved, That for the pre|&s;ervation of the peace and happine&s;s of the kingdom, and the &s;ecurity of the prote&s;tant religion, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that a further declaration &s;hould be made of the limitation and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the prote&s;tant line, after his maje&s;ty and the prince&s;s, and the heirs of their bodies re&s;pectively: and, That further provi&s;ion &s;hould be fir&s;t made for the &s;ecurity of the rights and liberties of the people. Mr. Harley moved, That &s;ome conditions of go|vernment might be &s;ettled as preliminaries, before they &s;hould proceed to the nomination of the per&s;on, that their &s;ecurity might be complete. Accordingly

Having &s;ettled the&s;e preliminaries, they re&s;olved, That the prince&s;s Sophia, dutche&s;s dowager of Hanover, be declared the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England, in the prote&s;tant line, after his maje&s;ty and the prince&s;s, and the heirs of their bodies re&s;pectively: and, That the further limitation of the crown be to the &s;aid prince&s;s Sophia and the heirs of her body, being prote&s;tants. A bill being formed on the&s;e re&s;olutions, was &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of lords, where it met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition from the mar|quis of Normanby; and a prote&s;t was entered again&s;t it by the earls of Hunting|ton and Plymouth, the lords Guilford and Jeffries. Neverthele&s;s, it pa&s;&s;ed without amendments, and on the twelfth day of June received the royal a&s;&s;ent: yet, the king was extremely mortified at the preliminary limitations, which he con&s;idered as an open in&s;ult on his own conduct and admini&s;tration; not but that they were nece&s;&s;ary precautions, naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by the experience of tho&s;e evils to which the nation had been already expo&s;ed, in con&s;equence of rai&s;|ing a foreign prince to the throne of England. As the Tories lay under the impu|tation of favouring the late king's intere&s;t, they exerted them&s;elves zealou&s;ly on this occa&s;ion, to wipe off the a&s;per&s;ion, and in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the confidence of the people; hoping, that in the &s;equel they &s;hould be able to re&s;train the nation from engaging too deep in the affairs of the continent, without incurring the charge of di&s;affection to the pre&s;ent king and government.

<P>The act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion gave umbrage to all the popi&s;h princes who were more nearly related to the crown than this lady, whom the parliament had preferred to all others. The dutche&s;s of Savoy, grand-daughter to king Charles I$ by her mother, ordered her amba&s;&s;ador count Maffei, to make a prote&s;tation to the par|liament of England, in her name, again&s;t all re&s;olutions and deci&s;ions contrary to her title, as &s;ole daughter to the prince&s;s Henrietta, next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England, after king William and the prince&s;s Anne of Denmark. Two copies of this prote&s;t Maffei &s;ent in letters to the lord-keeper and the &s;peaker of the lower hou&s;e, by two of his gentlemen and a public notary to atte&s;t the deli|very; but, no notice was taken of the declaration. The duke of Savoy$ while his mini&s;ter$ was thus employed in England, engaged in an alliance with the crowns of France and Spain, on condition, That his catholic maje&s;ty &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e his younge&s;t daughter without a dowry: That he him&s;elf &s;hould com|mand the allied army in Italy, and furni&s;h eight thou&s;and infantry, with five and twenty hundred hor&s;e, in con&s;ideration of a monthly &s;ub&s;idy of fifty thou|&s;and crowns.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Mr. Stanhope envoy extraordinary to the &s;tates-general, was empowered to treat with the mini&s;ters of France and Spain$ according to the addre&s;&s;es of both hou&s;es of parliament. He repre&s;ented$ that though his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty had thought fit to deviate from the par|tition$treaty, it was not rea&s;onable that the king of England &s;hould lo&s;e the effect of that convention: he therefore expected &s;ome &s;ecurity for the peace of Europe; and for that purpo&s;e in&s;i&s;ted upon certain articles, importing, That the French king &s;hould immediately withdraw his troops from the Spani&s;h Ne|therlands: That, for the &s;ecurity of England, the cities of O&s;tend and Newport &s;hould be delivered into the hands of his Britannic maje&s;ty: That no kingdom, provinces, cities, lands, or places belonging to the crown of Spain, &s;hould ever be yielded or transferred to the crown of France, on any pretence whatever: That the &s;ubjects of his Britannic maje&s;ty &s;hould retain all the privileges, rights, and immunities, with regard to their navigation and commerce in the dominions of Spain$ which they enjoyed at the death of his late catholic maje&s;ty: and al&s;o all &s;uch immunities, rights, and franchi&s;es, as the &s;ubjects of France or any other power, either po&s;&s;e&s;s for the pre&s;ent, or may enjoy for the future: That all treaties of peace and conventions between England and Spain &s;hould be re|newed: and, That a treaty formed on the&s;e demands &s;hould be guara$$ied by &s;uch powers as one or other of the contractors &s;hould &s;ollicit and prevail upon to accede. Such likewi&s;e were the propo&s;als made by the &s;tates$general, with this difference, that they demanded as cautionary towns all the &s;tronge&s;t places in the Netherlands. Count D'Avaux, the French mini&s;ter, was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at the&s;e exorbitant demands, that he could not help &s;aying, They could not have been higher if his ma&s;ter had lo&s;t four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive battles. He a&s;&s;ured them, that his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty would withdraw his troops from the Spani&s;h Nether|lands as &s;oon as the king of Spain &s;hould have forces of his own &s;ufficient to guard the country; but, with re&s;pect to the other articles, he could give no other an&s;wer, but that he would immediately tran&s;mit them to Ver&s;ailles. Lewis was filled with indignation at the in&s;olent &s;train of tho&s;e propo&s;als, which

<P>King William certainly had no expectation that France would clo&s;e with &s;uch propo&s;als; but, he was not without hope$ that her refu&s;al would warm the Engli&s;h nation into a concurrence with his de&s;igns. He communi|cated to the hou&s;e of commons the demands which had been made by him and the &s;tates-general; and gave them to under&s;tand, that he would from time to time make them acquainted with the progre&s;s of the negotiation. The com|mons &s;u&s;pecting, that his intention was to make them parties in a congre&s;s which he might conduct to a different end from that which they propo&s;ed, re&s;olved to &s;ignify their &s;entiments in the an&s;wer to this me&s;&s;age. They called for the treaty of partition, which being read, they voted an addre&s;s of thanks to his maje&s;ty for his gracious declaration, that he would make them acquainted with the progre&s;s of the negotiation; and they &s;ignified their di&s;approbation of the partition-tre$ty, &s;igned with the great &s;eal of England, without the advice of the parliament which was then &s;itting, and pro$uctive of ill con&s;equences to the kingdom, as well as to the peace of Europe, as it a&s;&s;igned over to the French king &s;uch a large portion of the Spani&s;h dominions. Nothing could be more mortifying to the king than this open attack upon his own conduct; yet he &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment, and without taking the lea&s;t notice of their &s;entiments with re&s;pect to the partition-treaty, a&s;&s;ured them, that he &s;hould be always ready to receive their advice on the negotiation which he had &s;et on foot, ac|cording to their de&s;ire. The debates in the hou&s;e of commons upon the &s;ub|ject of the partition-treaty, ro&s;e to &s;uch violence, that divers members, in de|claiming again&s;t it, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the bounds of decency. Sir Edward Seymour compared the divi&s;ion which had been made of the Spani&s;h territories, to a rob|bery on the highway; and Mr. Howe did not &s;cruple to &s;ay it was a felonious treaty: an expre&s;&s;ion, which the king re&s;ented to &s;uch a degree, that he de|clared he would have demanded per&s;onal &s;atisfaction with his &s;word, had not he been re&s;trained by the di&s;parity of condition between him&s;elf and the per&s;on who had offered &s;uch an outrageous in&s;ult to his honour. Whether the Tories in|tended to alienate the minds of the nation from all foreign connexions, or to wreak their vengeance on the late mini&s;ters, whom they hated as the chiefs of the Whig party, certain it is, they now rai&s;ed an univer&s;al outcry again&s;t the partition-treaty, which was not only condemned in public pamphlets and pri|vate conver&s;ation, but even brought into the hou&s;e of lords as an object of par|liamentary cen&s;ure. In the month of March a warm debate on this &s;ubject was begun by Sheffield marquis of Normanby, and carried on with great vehemence by other noblemen of the &s;ame faction. They exclaimed again&s;t the article by which &s;o many territories were added to the crown of France: they complained, that the emperor had been for&s;aken: that the treaty was not communicated to the pr$vy-council or mini&s;try, but clande&s;tinely tran&s;acted by the earls of Port|land and Jer&s;ey: and, that the &s;anction of the great &s;eal had been unju&s;tly and irregularly applied, fir&s;t to blank powers, and afterwards to the treaty it&s;elf. The courtiers replied, that the king had engaged in a treaty of partition at the de|&s;ire
<PB N="215" REF="2180">
of the emperor, who had agreed to every article except that relating to the dutchy of Milan, and afterwards de&s;ired, that his maje&s;ty would procure for him the be&s;t terms he could obtain; above all things recommending &s;ecre&s;y, that he might not forfeit his intere&s;t in Spain, by &s;eeming to con&s;ent to the treaty: that foreign negotiations being intru&s;ted to the care of the crown, the king lay under no legal obligation to communicate &s;uch &s;ecrets of &s;tate to his council; far le&s;s was he obliged to follow their advice: and, that the keeper of the great &s;eal had no authority for refu&s;ing to apply it to any powers or treaty which the king &s;hould grant or conclude, unle&s;s they were contrary to law, which had made no provi&s;ion for &s;uch an emergency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the cour&s;e of this debate, the earl of Ro|che&s;ter reprehended &s;ome lords for &s;peaking di&s;|re&s;pectfully of the French king, ob&s;erving, that it was peculiarly incumbent on peers to treat monarchs with decorum and re&s;pect, as they de|rived their dignity from the crown. Another affirming, that the French king was not only to be re&s;pected, but likewi&s;e to be feared; a certain lord replied, he hoped no man in England needed to be afraid of the French king, much le&s;s the peer who &s;poke la&s;t, who was too much a friend to that monarch to fear any thing from his re|&s;entment.</NOTE>. The earl of Portland apprehend|ing that this tempe&s;t would bur&s;t upon his head, declared, on the &s;econd day of the debate, that he had by the king's order communicated the treaty before it was concluded, to the earls of Pembroke and Marlborough, the lords Lon&s;dale, Somers, Hallifax, and &s;ecretary Vernon. The&s;e noblemen owned, that they had been made acquainted with the &s;ub&s;tance of it: that when they excepted to &s;ome particulars, they were told, his maje&s;ty had carried the matter as far as it could be advanced, and that he could obtain no better terms; thus a&s;&s;ured that every article was already &s;ettled, they no longer in&s;i&s;ted upon particulars, but gave their advice, that his maje&s;ty &s;hould not engage him&s;elf in any mea&s;ure that would produce a new war, &s;eeing the nation had been &s;o unea&s;y under the la&s;t. After long debates, and great variety as well as virulence of altercation, they agreed to an addre&s;s, in which they di&s;approved of the partition-treaty, as a &s;cheme incon&s;i&s;tent with the peace and &s;afety of Europe, as well as prejudicial to the intere&s;t of Great-Britain. They complained, that neither the in&s;tructions given to his plenipotentiaries, nor the draught of the treaty it&s;elf, had been laid before his maje&s;ty's council. They humbly be&s;ought him, that for the future, he would in all matters of importance, require, and admit the advice of his natural-born &s;ubjects of known probity and fortune: and, that he would con&s;titute a council of &s;uch per&s;ons, to whom he might impart all affairs which &s;hould any way concern him and his dominions. They ob&s;erved, that intere&s;t and natural affection to their country, would incline them to every mea&s;ure that might tend to its welfare and pro&s;perity; whereas &s;trangers could<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Cole. Lamberty. State Tracts. Tindal. Ralph. Voltaire.</NOTE> not be &s;o much influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations: that their knowledge of the country would render them more capable than foreigners could be, of advi&s;ing his maje&s;ty touching the true intere&s;ts of his kingdom: that they had exhibited &s;uch repeated demon&s;trations of their duty and affection, as mu&s;t convince his maje&s;ty of their zeal in his &s;ervice; nor could he want the knowledge of per&s;ons fit to be employed in all his &s;ecret and arduous affairs: finally, as the French king appeared to have violated the treaty of partition, they advi&s;ed his maje&s;ty in future negotiations with that prince, to proceed with &s;uch caution as might imply a real &s;ecurity.</P>

<P>The king received this &s;evere remon&s;trance with his u&s;ual phlegm, &s;aying, it contained matter of very great moment$ and, that he would take care that all treaties he made &s;hould be for the honour and &s;afety of England. Though he deeply felt this affront, he would not alter his conduct towards the new mini&s;ters; but, he plainly perceived their intention was to thwart him in his favourite mea&s;ure, and humble him into a dependence upon their intere&s;t in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1701.</NOTE> parliament. On the la&s;t day of March he imparted to the commons the French king's declaration, that he would grant no other &s;ecurity than $word$ renew$$ of the treaty of Ry&s;wick: &s;o that the negotiation &s;eemed to be at $word$ end. He like|wi&s;e communicated two re&s;olutions of the &s;tates-general, with a memorial from their envoy in England, relating to the &s;hips they had equipped with a view to join the Engli&s;h $$eet, and the &s;uccours &s;tipulated in the treaty concluded in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even, which they de&s;ired might be &s;ent over with all convenient expedition. The hou&s;e having con&s;idered this me&s;&s;age, unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, to de&s;ire his maje&s;ty would carry on the negotia|tions in concert with the &s;tates-general, and take &s;uch mea&s;ures therein as might mo&s;t conduce to their &s;afety; and, they a&s;&s;ured him, they would effectually enable him to &s;upport the treaty of &s;eventy-&s;even, by which England was bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with ten thou&s;and men, and twenty &s;hips of war, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be attacked. Though the king was nettled at that part of this addre&s;s, which, by confining him to one treaty, implied their $span$ a new confe|deracy, he di&s;covered no &s;igns of emotion; but, thanked them for the a&s;&s;ur|ance they had given, and told them he had &s;ent orders to his envoy at the Hague, to continue the conferences with the courts of France and Spain. On the nine|teenth day of April the marquis de Torcy delivered to the earl of Manche&s;ter at Paris, a letter, from the new king of Spain to his Britannic maje&s;ty, notifying his acce&s;&s;ion to that throne, and expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire of cultivating a mutual friend&s;hip with the king and crown of England. How aver&s;e &s;oever William might have been to any corre&s;pondence of this &s;ort, the earl of Roche&s;ter and the new mini&s;ters importuned him in &s;uch a manner to acknowledge Philip, that he at length complied with their intreaties; and wrote a civil an&s;wer to his mo&s;t catholic maje&s;ty. This was a very alarming incident to the emperor, who was bent upon a war with the two crowns, and had determined to &s;end prince Eugene with an army into Italy, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the dutchy of Milan, as a $word$ of the empire. The new pope Clement XI. who had &s;ucceeded to the papacy in the preceding year, was attached to the French intere&s;t, while the Venetians favoured the emperor; but, they refu&s;ed to declare them&s;elves at this juncture.</P>

<P>The French king con&s;ented to a renewal of the negotiations at the Hague; but, in the mean time tampered with the Dutch deputies, to engage them in a &s;eparate treaty. Finding them determined to act in concert with the king of England, he protracted the conferences, in order to gain time, while he erected fortifications, and drew lines on the frontiers of Holland, divided the princes of the empire by his intrigues, and endeavoured to gain over the &s;tates of Italy. The Dutch, mean while, exerted them&s;elves in providing for their own &s;ecurity. They reinforced their garri$ons, purcha&s;ed &s;upplies, and &s;ollicited &s;uccours from foreign potentates. The &s;tates wrote a letter to king William,
<PB N="217" REF="2200">
explaining the danger of their &s;ituation, profe&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t inviolable attach|ment to the intere&s;t of England$ and de&s;iring$ that the &s;tipulated number of troops &s;hould be &s;ent immediately to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The three Scotti&s;h regi|ments which he had retained in his own pay, were immediately tran&s;ported from Scotland. The letter of the &s;tates-general he communicated to the hou&s;e of commons, who having taken it into con&s;ideration, re&s;olved to a&s;&s;i&s;t his ma|je&s;ty to &s;upport his allies in maintaining the liberty of Europe; and to provide immediately &s;uccours for the &s;tates-general, according to the treaty of &s;eventy|&s;even. The hou&s;e of peers, to whom the letter was al&s;o communicated, carried their zeal &s;till farther. They pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, in which they de&s;ired his maje&s;ty would not only perform the articles of any former treaty with the &s;tates-general, but al&s;o engage with them in a &s;trict league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, for their common pre&s;ervation; and invite into it all the princes and &s;tates that were concerned in the pre&s;ent vi&s;ible danger ari&s;ing from the union of France and Spain. They exhorted him to enter into &s;uch alliances with the emperor, as his maje&s;ty &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary, pur&s;uant to the ends of the treaty con|cluded in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and eighty-nine. They a&s;&s;ured him of their hearty and &s;incere a&s;&s;i&s;tance, not doubting that almighty God would protect his &s;acred per&s;on in &s;o righteous a cau&s;e; and, that the unani|mity, wealth, and courage of his &s;ubjects would carry him with honour and &s;ucce&s;s-through all the difficulties of a ju&s;t war. La&s;tly, they took leave hum|bly to repre&s;ent, that the dangers to which his kingdom and allies had been expo&s;ed, were chiefly owing to the fatal coun&s;els that prevented his maje&s;ty's &s;ooner meeting his people in parliament.</P>

<P>The&s;e proceedings of both hou&s;es could not but be very agreeable to the king, who expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction in his an&s;wer to each apart. They were the more remarkable, as at this very time, con&s;iderable progre&s;s was made in a de&s;ign to impeach the old mini&s;try. This deviation, therefore, from the te|nour of their former conduct, could be owing to no other motive than a &s;en&s;e of their own danger, and re&s;entment again&s;t France, which, even during the nego|tiation, had been &s;ecretly employed in making preparations to &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;tre&s;s the &s;tates-general. The commons having expre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments on this &s;ub|ject, re&s;umed the con&s;ideration of the partition-treaty. They had appointed a committee to examine the journals of the hou&s;e of lords, and to report their proceedings in relation to the treaty of partition. When the report was made by Sir Edward Seymour, the hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee, to con&s;ider the &s;tate of the nation; and, after warm debates, re&s;olved, That William earl of Portland, by negotiating and concluding the treaty of partition, was guilty of a high crime and mi&s;demeanour. They ordered Sir John Levi&s;on Gower to impeach him at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords; and named a committee to prepare the articles of his impeachment. Then, in a conference with the lords, they de&s;ired to know the particulars of what had pa&s;&s;ed between the earl of Portland and &s;ecretary Vernon, in relation to the partition-treaty, as al&s;o what other information they had obtained concerning negotiations or treaties of par|tition of the Spani&s;h monarchy. The lords demurring to this demand, the lower hou&s;e re&s;olved to addre&s;s the king, That copies of both treaties of par|tition, together with all the powers and in&s;tructions for negotiating tho&s;e trea|ties, &s;hould be layed before them. The copies were accordingly produced, and
<PB N="218" REF="2210">
the lords &s;ent down to the commons two papers, containing the powers granted to the earls of Portland and J$r&s;ey, for &s;igning both treaties of partition. The hou&s;e afterwards ordered, T$at Mr. &s;ecretary Vernon &s;hould lay before them all the letters which had pa&s;&s;ed between the earl of Portland and him, in relation to tho&s;e treaties; and he thought proper to obey their command. Nothing could be m$re &s;$andalou&s;ly partial than the conduct of the commons on this occa&s;ion. They re&s;olved to &s;kr$en the earl of Jer&s;ey, Sir Jo&s;eph William&s;on, and Mr. Vernon, who had b$en as deeply concerned as any others in that tran&s;action; and pointed all their vengeance again&s;t the earls of Portland and Orford, the lords Somers and Hallifax. Some of the members even tampered with Kidd, who was now a pri&s;oner in Newgate, to accu&s;e lord Somers as having encou|raged him in his pyracy. He was brought to the bar of the hou&s;e and exa|mined; but, he declared that he had never &s;poke to lord Somers; and, that he had no order from tho&s;e concerned in the &s;hip, but that of pur&s;uing his voyage again&s;t the pyrates in Madaga&s;car. Finding him unfit for their purpo&s;e, they left him to the cour&s;e of law; and he, with &s;ome of his crew, were hanged.</P>

<P>Lord Somers under&s;tanding that he was accu&s;ed in the hou&s;e of com|mons, of having con&s;ented to the partition-treaty, de&s;ired, that he might be admitted and heard in his own defence. His reque&s;t being granted, he told the hou&s;e, that when he received the king's letter concerning the partition-treaty, with an order to &s;end over the nece&s;&s;ary powers in the mo&s;t &s;ecret man|ner, he thought it would have been taking too much upon him to put a &s;top to a treaty of &s;uch con&s;equence, when the life of the king of Spain was &s;o preca|rious; for, had that king died before the treaty was fini&s;hed, and he been blamed for delaying the nece&s;&s;ary powers, he could not have ju&s;tified his own conduct, &s;ince the king's letter was really a warrant: that, neverthele&s;s, he had written a letter to his maje&s;ty, objecting to &s;everal particulars in the treaty, and propo&s;|ing other articles which he thought were for the intere&s;t of his country: t$at he thought him&s;elf bound to put the great &s;eal to the treaty when it was con|cluded$ that, as a privy-coun&s;ellor, he had offered his be&s;t advice, and as chancellor, executed his office according to his duty. After he had withdrawn, his ju&s;tification gave ri&s;e to a long debate, which ended in a re&s;olution carried by a majority of &s;even voices$ That John lord Somers, by advi&s;ing his maje&s;ty to conclude the treaty of partition, whereby large territories of the Spani&s;h monarchy were to be deliv$red up to France, was guilty of a high crime and mi&s;demeanour. Votes to the &s;ame effect were pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t Edward ea$l of Orford, and Charles lord Hallifax; and all three were impeached at the bar of the upper hou&s;e. But, the commons knowing, that tho&s;e impeachments would produ$e nothing in the hou&s;e of lords, where the oppo&s;ite intere&s;t pre|dominated, they re&s;olved to proceed again&s;t the accu&s;ed noblemen in a more expeditious and effectual way of branding their reputation. They voted and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring he would remove them from his councils and pre&s;ence for ever, as advi&s;ers of a treaty &s;o pernicious to the trade and welfare of England. They concluded, by repeating their a&s;&s;urances, that they would always &s;tand by and &s;upport his maje&s;ty to the utmo&s;t of their power, again&s;t all his enemies both $t home and abroad. The king, in his an|&s;wer, artfully overlooked the fir&s;t part of the remon&s;trance. He thanked them for their repeated a&s;&s;urances; and, told them he would employ none in his &s;er|vice
<PB N="219" REF="2220">
but &s;uch as &s;hould be thought mo$t likely to improve that mutual tru&s;t and confidence between him an$ his people, which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at that con|juncture, both for their own &s;$curity and the pre&s;ervation of their allies.</P>

<P>The lords, incen&s;ed at this &s;tep of the commons, which they con&s;i|dered as an in&s;ult upon their t$ibunal, and a violation of common ju&s;tice, drew up and delivered a counter$addre&s;s, humbly be&s;eeching his maje&s;ty, that he would not pa&s;s any cen&s;ure upon the accu&s;ed lords, until they &s;hould be tried on the impeachm$nts, and judgment be given according to the u&s;age of parlia|ment. The king was &s;o perplexed by the&s;e oppo&s;ite repre&s;entations, that he knew not well what cour&s;e to follow. He made no reply to the counter-addre&s;s$ but, allowed the names of the impeached lords to remain in the $ouncil-books. The commons having carried their point, which was to &s;tigmatize tho&s;e noble|men, and prevent their being employed for the future, &s;uffered the impeach|ments to be neglected, until they them&s;elves moved for trial. On the fifth day of May the hou&s;$ of lords &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, importing, That no articles had as yet been exhibited again&s;t the noblemen whom they had im|peached. The charge was immediately drawn up again&s;t the earl of Orford, whom they accu&s;ed of having received exorbitant grants from the crown: of having been concerned with Kidd the pyrate: of having committed abu&s;es in managing and victualling the fleet when it lay on the coa&s;t of Spain: and la&s;tly, of having advi&s;ed the partition-treaty. The earl in his own defence declared, that he had received no grant from the king, except a very di&s;tant rever&s;ion, and a pre&s;ent of ten thou&s;and pounds after he had defeated the French at La Hogue: that in Kidd's affair he had acted legally, and with a good in|tention towards the public, tho' to his own lo&s;s: that his accounts with regard to the fleet which he commanded, had been examined and pa&s;&s;ed; yet, he was ready to wave that advantage, and ju&s;tify him&s;elf in every particular: and he ab&s;olutely denied, that he had given any advice concerning the treaty of par|tition. Lord Somers was accu&s;ed of having &s;et the &s;eals to the powers, and afterwards to the treaties: of having accepted &s;ome grants: of having been an accomplice with Kidd: and, of having been guilty of partial and dilatory pro|ceedings in chancery. He an&s;wered every article of the charge; but, no repli|cation was made by the commons, either to him or to the earl of Orford. When the commons were &s;timulated by another me&s;&s;age from the peers, relating to the impeachments of the earl of Portland and lord Hallifax, they declined exhibiting articles again&s;t the former, on pretence of re&s;pect for his maje&s;ty; but, on the fourteenth of June the charge again&s;t Hallifax was &s;ent up to the lords. He was taxed with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a grant in Ireland, without paying the produce of it, according to the law lately enacted concerning tho&s;e grants: with enjoying another grant out of the fore&s;t of Dean, to the wa&s;te of the timber, and the prejudice of the navy: with having held places that were incompati|ble, by being at the &s;ame time commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea&s;ury, and chancellor of the exchequer: and, with having advi&s;ed the two treaties of partition. He an|&s;wered, that his grant $n Ireland was of debts and &s;ums of money, not within the act concerning confi&s;cated e&s;tates: that all he had ever received from it, did not exceed four hundred pounds, which, if he was bound to repay, a common action would lie again&s;t him; but$ every man was not to be impeached who did not di&s;charge his debts at the very day of payment. He ob&s;erved, that as
<PB N="220" REF="2230">
his grant in the fore&s;t of Dean extended to weedings only, it could occa&s;ion no wa&s;te of timber, nor prejudice to the navy: that the auditor's place was held by another per&s;on, until he obtained the king's leave to withdraw from the trea|&s;ury: that he never &s;aw the fir&s;t treaty of partition, nor was his advice a&s;ked upo$ the &s;ubject: that he had never heard of the &s;econd but once before it was co$cl$ded; and, then he &s;poke his &s;entiments freely on the &s;ubject. This an|&s;wer, like the others, would have been neglected by the commons, who&s;e aim was now to evade the trials, had not the lords pre&s;&s;ed them by me&s;&s;ages to ex|pedite the articles. They even appointed a day for Orford's trial, and &s;ignified their re&s;olution to the commons, who de&s;ired that a committee of both hou&s;es &s;hould be named for &s;ettling preliminaries, one of which was, That the lord to be tried &s;hould not &s;it as a peer; and, the other imported, That tho&s;e lords im|peached for the &s;ame matter, &s;hould not vote in the trial of each other. They likewi&s;e de&s;ired, that lord Somers &s;hould be fir&s;t tried. The lords made no objection to this la&s;t demand: but, they rejected the propo&s;al of a committee con&s;i$$ing of both hou&s;es, alledging, that the commons were parties, and had no title to &s;it in equality with the judges, or to &s;ettle matters relating to the trial: that this was a demand contrary to the principles of law and rules of ju|&s;tice, and never practi&s;ed in any court or nation. The lords, indeed, had yielded to this expedient in the popi&s;h plot, becau&s;e it was a ca&s;e of trea&s;on, in which the king's life and &s;afety of the kingdom were concerned, while the people were jealous of the court, and the whole nation was in a ferment: but, at pre&s;ent the times were quiet, and the charge amounted to nothing more than mi&s;demea|nours; therefore, the lords could not a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch a propo&s;al as was dero|gatory from their juri&s;diction. Neither would they agree to the preliminaries; but, on the twelfth day of June, re&s;olved, That no peer impeached for high crimes and mi&s;demeanours$ &s;hould upon his trial be without the bar: and, That no peer impeached can be precluded from voting on any occa&s;ion, except in his own trial. Divers me&s;&s;ages pa&s;&s;ed between the two hou&s;es; the commons &s;till in&s;i&s;ting upon a committee to &s;ettle preliminaries: at length, the di&s;pute was brought to a free conference.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; LIII.</HEAD>
<P>Mean while, the king going to the hou&s;e of peers, gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to the bill of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and in his &s;peech expre&s;&s;ed his warm acknowledgments for their repeated a&s;&s;urances of &s;upporting him in &s;uch alliances as &s;hould be mo&s;t proper for the pre&s;ervation of the li$ rty of Europe, and for the &s;ecurity of England and the &s;tates-general. He ob&s;erved, that the &s;ea&s;on of the year was ad|$anced: that the po&s;ture of affairs ab&s;olutely required his pre&s;ence abroad: and, $e recommended di&s;patch of the public bu&s;ine&s;s, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e matters which were of the greate&s;t importance. The commons thanked him in an addre&s;s for having approved of their proceedings: declared they would &s;upport him in &s;uch alliances as he &s;hould think fit to make in conjunction with the emperor and the &s;tates-general, for the peace of Europe, and reducing the exorbitant power of France. Then they re&s;umed their di&s;pute with the upper hou&s;e. In the free conference, lord Haver$$am happened to tax the commons with partiality, in $npeaching &s;ome lords and $ereening others, who were equally guilty of the $ame mi&s;demeanours. Sir Chri&s;topher Mu$grave and the managers for the $ommons immediately withdrew; and, this unguarded fally being reported to $$e hou&s;e, they immediately re&s;olved, That John lord Haver$$am had uttered
<PB N="221" REF="2240">
mo&s;t &s;candalous reproaches and fal&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, highly reflecting upon the ho|nour and ju&s;tice of the hou&s;e of commons$ tending to a breach in the good corre&s;pondence between the two hou&s;es, and to the interruption of the public ju&s;tice of the nation: That the &s;aid lord Haver&s;ham &s;hould be charged before the lords for the &s;aid words: That the lords &s;hould be de&s;ired to proceed in ju&s;tice again&s;t him, and to inflict upon him &s;uch puni&s;hment as &s;o high $n of|fence again&s;t the commons did de&s;erve. The commons had now found a pre|tence to ju&s;tify their delay; and declared they would not renew the conference until they &s;hould have received &s;atisfaction. Lord Haver&s;ham offered to &s;ub|mit to a trial; but, in&s;i&s;ted on their fir&s;t proving the words which he was &s;aid to have &s;poken. When this declaration was imparted to the commons, they &s;aid$ the lords ought to have cen&s;ured him in a &s;ummary way; and &s;till re|fu&s;ed to renew the conference. The lords, on the other hand, came to a re&s;o|lution, That there &s;hould not be a committee of both hou&s;es concerning the trial of the impeached lords. Then they re&s;olved, That lord Somers &s;hould be tried in We&s;tmin&s;ter hall on Tue&s;day the &s;eventeenth day of June, and &s;ig|nified this re&s;olution to the lower hou&s;e; reminding them, at the &s;ame time, of the articles again&s;t the earl of Portland. The commons refu&s;ed to appear, al|ledging, they were the only judges, and, that the evidence was not yet pre|pared. They &s;ent up the rea&s;ons of their non-appearance to the hou&s;e of lords, where they were &s;upported by the new mini&s;try and all the malcontents; and produced very warm debates. The majority carried their point piecemeal, by dint of different votes, again&s;t which very &s;evere prote&s;ts were entered. On the day appointed for the trial, they &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, that they were going to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. The other impeached lords a&s;ked leave, and were permitted to withdraw. The articles of impeachment again&s;t lord Somers, and his an&s;wers, being read in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and the commons not appearing to pro&s;ecute, the lords adjourned to their own hou&s;e, where they debated con|cerning the que&s;tion that was to be put. This being &s;ettled, they returned to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall; and the que&s;tion being put, <Q>&startq;That John lord Somers be acquitted of the articles of impeachment again&s;t him, exhibited by the hou&s;e of commons, and all things thereing contained: and, That the impeach|ment be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed?&endq;</Q> It was carried by a majority of thirty-five. The com|mons, exa&s;perated at the&s;e proceedings, re&s;olved, That the lords had refu&s;ed ju&s;|tice to the commons: That they had endeavoured to overturn the right of im|peachments lodged in the commons by the antient con&s;titution of the kingdom: and, That all the ill con&s;equences which might attend the delay of the &s;up|plies, given for the pre&s;ervation of the public peace, and the maintenance of the balance of Europe, would be owing to tho&s;e who, to procure an indem|nity for their own crimes, had u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours to make a breach between the two hou&s;es. The lords &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, giving them to under&s;tand, that they had acquitted lord Somers, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the im|peachment, as no body had appeared to &s;upport the articles: and, that they had appointed next Monday for the trial of the earl of Orford. They re&s;olved, That unle&s;s the charge again&s;t lord Haver&s;ham &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted by the com|mons before the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the lords would adjudge him innocent: That the re&s;olutions of the commons in their late votes, contained mo&s;t unju&s;t reflections on the honour and ju&s;tice of the peers: That they were contrived to
<PB N="222" REF="2250">
cover their affected and unrea&s;onable delays in pro&s;ecuting the impeached lords: That they manife&s;tly tended to the de&s;truction of the judicature of the lords; to the rendering trials on impeachments impracticable for the future; and to the &s;ubverting the con&s;titution of the Engli&s;h government: That, therefore, what|ever ill con&s;equences might ari&s;e from the &s;o long deferring the &s;upplies for this year's &s;ervice, were to be attributed to the fatal coun&s;el of the putting off the meeting of a parliament &s;o long, and to the unnece&s;&s;ary delays of the hou&s;e of commons. On the twenty-third day of June, the articles of impeachment ag$$$$t Edward $arl of Orford were read in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall; but the hou&s;e of commons having previou&s;ly ordered that none of their members &s;hould appear at this pretended trial, tho&s;e articles were not &s;upported: &s;o that his lord&s;hip was $cquitted, and the impeachment di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Next day, the impeachment again&s;t the duke of Leeds, which had lain &s;even years neglected, together with tho&s;e again&s;t the earl of Portland and lord Hallifax, as well as the charge again&s;t lord Haver&s;ham, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for want of pro&s;ecution. Each hou&s;e ordered a narrative of tho&s;e proceedings to be publi&s;hed; and their mutual animo&s;ity had proceeded to &s;uch a degree of rancour, as &s;eemed to preclude all po&s;&s;ibility of reconciliation. The commons, in the whole cour&s;e of this tran&s;action, had certainly acted from the motives of faction and revenge; for nothing could be more unju&s;t, frivolous, and partial, than the charge exhibited in the articles of impeachment, their anticipating addre&s;s to the king, and their affected delay in the pro&s;ecutions. Their conduct on this occa&s;ion was &s;o flagrant as to attract the notice of the common people, and in&s;pire the generality of the nation with di&s;gu&s;t. This the Whigs did not fail to augment by the arts of calumny, and, in particular, by in&s;inuating that the court of Ver&s;ailles had found means to engage the majority of the commons in its intere&s;t.</P>

<P>The&s;e had, &s;ince the beginning of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, employed their emi&s;|&s;aries in exciting a popular aver&s;ion to the Tory mini&s;ters and members, and &s;ucceeded &s;o well in their endeavours, that they formed a &s;cheme of obtaining petitions from different counties and corporations, that &s;hould induce the com|mons to alter their conduct, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that it was contrary to the &s;en&s;e of the nation. In execution of this &s;cheme, a petition, &s;igned by the deputy|lieutenants, above twenty ju&s;tices of the peace, the grand jury and freeholders of the county of Kent, had been pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e of commons on the eighteenth day of May, by five gentlemen of fortune and di&s;tinction. The purport of this remon&s;trance was, to recommend union among them&s;elves, and confidence in his maje&s;ty, who&s;e great actions for the nation could never be forgot without the blacke&s;t ingratitude: to beg they would have regard to the voice of the people; that their religion and &s;afety might be effectually pro|vided for$ that their loyal addre&s;&s;es might be turned into bills of &s;upply; and that his mo&s;t &s;acred maje&s;ty might be enabled powerfully to a&s;&s;i&s;t his allies before it &s;hould be too late. The hou&s;e was &s;o incen&s;ed at the petulance of the petition, that they voted it &s;candalous, in&s;olent, and &s;editious; and or|dered the gentlemen who had pre&s;ented it to be taken into cu&s;tody. They were afterwards committed to the Gate-hou&s;e, where they remained till the prorogation of parliament: but they had no rea&s;on to repine at their impri&s;on|ment, which recommended them to the notice and e&s;teem of the public. They were vi&s;ited and care&s;&s;ed by the chiefs of the Whig-intere&s;t, and con&s;idered as mar|tyrs
<PB N="223" REF="2260">
to the liberties of the people. Their confinement gave ri&s;e to a very ex|traordinary paper, intitled, <Q>&startq;A Memorial from the gentlemen, freeholders, and inhabitants, of the counties of&mdash;, in behalf of them&s;elves, and many thou&s;ands of the good people of England.&endq;</Q> It was &s;igned Legion, and &s;ent to the &s;peaker in a letter, commanding him, in the name of two hundred thou&s;and Engli&s;hmen, to deliver it to the hou&s;e of commons. In this &s;trange expo&s;tulation, the hou&s;e was charged with illegal and unwarrantable practices, in fifteen particulars; a new claim of right was ranged under &s;even heads; and the commons were admoni&s;hed to act according to their duty, as &s;pecified in this memorial, on pain of incurring the re&s;entment of an injured nation. It was concluded in the&s;e words: <Q>&startq;For Engli&s;hmen are no more to be &s;laves to par|liaments than to kings; our name is Legion, and we are many.&endq;</Q> The commons were equally provoked and intimidated by this libel, which was the production of one Daniel de Foe, a &s;currilous party-writer, in very little e&s;ti|mation. They would not, however, deign to take notice of it in the hou&s;e; but a complaint being made of endeavours to rai&s;e tumults and &s;editions, a committee was appointed to draw up an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, informing him of tho&s;e &s;editious endeavours, and be&s;eeching him to provide for the public peace and &s;ecurity.</P>

<DIV4 N="55" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; LV.</HEAD>
<P>The hou&s;e, however, perceiving plainly that they had incurred the odium of the nation, which began to clamour for a war with France, and dreading the popular re&s;entment, thought fit to change their mea&s;ures with re|&s;pect to this object, and pre&s;ent the addre&s;s we have already mentioned, in which they promi&s;ed to &s;upport him in the alliances he &s;hould contract with the emperor and other &s;tates, in order to bridle the exorbitant power of France. They likewi&s;e proceeded in earne&s;t upon the &s;upply, and voted funds for rai&s;ing about two millions &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds, to defray the expence of the en&s;uing year. They voted thirty thou&s;and &s;eamen, and re&s;olved that ten thou&s;and troops &s;hould be tran&s;ported from Ireland to Holland, as the auxi|liaries &s;tipulated in the treaty of &s;eventy-&s;even with the &s;tates-general. The funds were con&s;tituted of a land-tax, certain duties on merchandi&s;e, and a weekly deduction from the exci&s;e, &s;o as to bring down the civil li&s;t to &s;ix hun|dred thou&s;and pounds; as the duke of Glouce&s;ter was dead, and James's queen refu&s;ed her allowance. They pa&s;&s;ed a bill for taking away all privilege of par|liament in legal pro&s;ecutions, during the intermediate prorogations; and their la&s;t &s;truggle with the lords was concerning a bill for appointing commi&s;&s;ioners to examine and &s;tate the public accounts. The per&s;ons nominated for this purpo&s;e were extremely obnoxious to the majority of the peers, as violent parti&s;ans of the Tory faction; when the bill therefore was &s;ent up to the lords, they made &s;ome amendments which the commons rejected. The former ani|mo&s;ity between the two hou&s;es began to revive, when the king interrupted their di&s;putes by putting an end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion, on the twenty-fourth day of June, after having thanked the parliament for their zeal in the public &s;ervice, and exhorted them to a di&s;charge of their duties in their &s;everal counties. He was no doubt extremely plea&s;ed with &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue of a &s;e&s;&s;ion that had begun with a very inau&s;picious a&s;pect. His health daily declined; but he con|cealed the decay of his con&s;titution, that his allies might not be di&s;couraged from engaging in a confederacy of which he was deemed the head and chief
<PB N="224" REF="2270">
&s;upport. He conferred the command of the ten thou&s;and troops de&s;tined for Holland upon the earl of Marlborough, and appointed him at the &s;ame time his plenipotentiary to the &s;tates-general; a choice that evinced his di&s;cernment and di&s;cretion; for that nobleman &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all his cotemporaries, both as a general and a politician. He was cool, penetrating, intrepid, and per&s;evering, plau$ible, in&s;inuating, artful, and di&s;&s;embling.</P>

<P>A regency being e&s;tabli&s;hed, the king embarked for Holland in the beginning of July; and, on his arrival at the Hague, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates-general, whom he harrangued in very affectionate terms, and was an&s;wered with great cordiality: then he made a progre&s;s round the frontiers, to examine the &s;tate of the garri&s;ons; and gave &s;uch orders and directions as he judged nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the country. Mean while, the French mini&s;ter D'Avaux being recalled from the Hague, delivered a letter to the &s;tates from the French king, who complained that they had often interrupted the conferences, from which no good fruits were to be expected: but he a&s;&s;ured them it wholly depended upon them&s;elves, whether they &s;hould continue to re|ceive marks of his antient friend&s;hip for their republic. This letter was ac|companied by an in&s;olent memorial, to which the &s;tates-general returned a very &s;pirited an&s;wer. As they expected nothing now but ho&s;tilities from France, they redoubled their diligence in making preparations for their own defence. They repaired their fortifications, augmented their army, and hired auxiliaries. King William and they had already engaged in an alliance with the king of Denmark, who undertook to furni&s;h a certain number of troops, in con&s;ideration of a &s;ub&s;idy; and they endeavoured to mediate a peace between Sweden and Poland; but this they could not effect. France had likewi&s;e offered her mediation between tho&s;e powers, in hope of bringing over Sweden to her intere&s;t; and the court of Vienna had tampered with the king of Poland; but he per&s;i&s;ted in his re|&s;olution to pro&s;ecute the war. The Spaniards began to be very unea&s;y under the dominion of their new ma&s;ter. They were &s;hocked at the in&s;olence of his French mini&s;ters and attendants, and much more at the manners and fa&s;hions which they introduced. The grandees found them&s;elves very little con&s;idered by their &s;overeign, and re&s;ented his $economy; for he had endeavoured to re|trench the expence of the court, which had u&s;ed to &s;upport their magnificence. Prince Eugene, at the head of the Imperial army, had entered Italy by Vi|cenza, and pa&s;&s;ed the Adige near Carpi, where he defeated a body of five thou&s;and French forces. The enemy were commanded by the duke of Savoy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by marechal Catinat and the prince of Vaudemont, who did not think proper to hazard an engagement. But marechal Villeroy arriving in the latter end of Augu&s;t, with orders to attack the Imperiali&s;ts, Catinat retired in di&s;gu&s;t. The new general marched immediately towards Chiari, where prince Eugene was in|tre$ched, and attacked his camp, but met with &s;uch a reception that he was obliged to retire with the lo&s;s of five thou&s;and men. Towards the end of the campaign, the prince took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Mantuan territories, except Mantua it&s;elf, and Goits, the blockade of which he formed. He reduced all the places on the Ogli$, and continued in the field during the whole winter, exhibiting repeated marks of the mo&s;t invincible courage, indefatigable vigilance, and exten&s;ive capacity in the art of war. In January he had well nigh &s;urpri&s;ed Cremona, by introducing a body of men through an old aqueduct. They forced one of the

gates, by which the prince and his followers entered: Villeroy being wakened by the noi&s;e, ran out into the &s;treet, where he wa$ taken$ and the town mu&s;t have been infallibly reduced, had prince Eugene been joined by another body of troops which he had ordered to march from the Parme&s;an and &s;ecure the bridge. The&s;e not arriving at the time appointed, an Iri&s;h regiment in the French &s;ervice took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge, and the prince was obliged to retire with his pri&s;oner.</P>

<P>The French king, alarmed at the activity and military genius of the Imperial general, &s;ent a reinforcement to his army in Italy, and the duke of Vendome to command his forces in that country: he likewi&s;e importuned the duke of Savoy to a&s;&s;i&s;t him effectually; but that prince having obtained all he could expect from France, became cold and backward. His &s;econd daughter was by this time married to the new king of Spain, who met her at Barcelona, where he found him&s;elf involved in di&s;putes with the &s;tates of Catalonia, who refu&s;ed to pay a tax he had impo&s;ed, until their privileges &s;hould be confirmed; and he was obliged to gratify them in this particular. The war continued to rage in the North. The young king of Sweden routed the Saxons upon the river Danu; thence he marched into Courland, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mit|tau without oppo&s;ition; while the king of Poland retired into Lithuania. In Hungary the French emi&s;&s;aries endeavoured to &s;ow the &s;eeds of a new revolt. They exerted them&s;elves with indefatigable indu&s;try in almo&s;t every court of Chri&s;tendom. They had already gained over the elector of Bavaria, and his brother the elector of Cologne, together with the dukes of Wolfembuttle and Saxe-Gotha, who profe&s;&s;ed neutrality while they levied troops, and made &s;uch preparations for war as plainly indicated that they had received &s;ub&s;idies from France. Lewis had al&s;o extorted a treaty of alliance from the king of Portugal, who was per&s;onally attached to the Au&s;trian intere&s;t: but this weak prince was a &s;lave to his mini&s;ters, whom the French king had corrupted. During this &s;ummer, the French coa&s;ts were overawed by the combined fleets of England and Holland, under the command of Sir George Rooke, who &s;ailed down the channel in the latter end of Augu&s;t, and detached vice-admiral Benbow with a &s;trong &s;quadron to the We&s;t Indies. In order to deceive the French king with regard to the de&s;tination of this fleet, king William demanded the free u&s;e of the Spani&s;h harbours, as if his de&s;ign had been to &s;end a &s;quadron to the Mediterranean; but he met with a repul&s;e, while the French &s;hips were freely admitted. About this period the king revoked his letters-patent to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the admiralty, and con&s;tituted the earl of Pembroke lord-high-admiral of England, in order to avoid the factions, the di&s;putes, and di|vided coun&s;els of a board. The earl was no &s;ooner promoted to this office, than he &s;ent captain Loades with three frigates to Cadiz, to bring home the &s;ea-&s;tores and effects belonging to the Engli&s;h in that place, before the war &s;hould commence$ and this piece of &s;ervice was &s;ucce&s;sfully performed. The French king, in order to enjoy all the advantages that could be derived from his union with Spain, e&s;tabli&s;hed a company to open a trade with Mexico and Peru; and concluded a new a&s;&s;iento treaty for &s;upplying the Spani&s;h planta|tions with negroes. At the &s;ame time he &s;ent a &s;trong &s;qu$dron to the port of Cadiz. The French dre&s;s was introduced into the court of Spain; and, by a formal edict, the grandees of that kingdom and the p$ers of France were put
<PB N="226" REF="2290">
on a level in each nation. There was no vigour left in the councils of Spain: her finances were exhau&s;ted; her former &s;pirit &s;eerned to be quite extin|gui&s;hed: the nobility were beggars, and the common people overwhelmed with i$digence and di&s;tre&s;s. The condition of France was not much more pro&s;pero$$. She had been harra&s;&s;ed by a long war, and now &s;aw her&s;elf on the eve of another, which in all probability would render her completely mi&s;erable.</P>

<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances were well known to the emperor and the mari|$$me powers, and &s;erved to animate their negotiations for another grand alliance. Conferences were opened at the Hague; and, on the &s;eventh day of Septem|ber, a treaty was concluded between his Imperial maje&s;ty, England, and the &s;tates-general. The objects propo&s;ed, were to procure &s;atisfaction to the em|peror in the Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for the dominions and commerce of the allies. They engaged to u&s;e their endeavours for recovering the Spani&s;h Netherlands, as a barrier between Holland and France; and for the emperor, the dutchy of Milan, Naples, and Sicily, with the lands and i$lands upon the coa&s;t of Tu&s;cany, belonging to the Spani&s;h dominions. They agreed that the king of England and the &s;tates-general &s;hould keep and po&s;&s;e&s;s whatever lands and cities they could conquer from the Spaniards in the Indies: That the confederates &s;hould faithfully communicate their de&s;igns to one an|other: That no party &s;hould treat of peace, or truce, but jointly with the re&s;t: That they &s;hould concur in preventing the union of France and Spain under the &s;ame government; and hinder the French from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Spani&s;h Indies: That, in concluding a peace, the confederates &s;hould provide for the maintenance of the commerce carried on by the maritime powers to the dominions taken from the Spaniards, and &s;ecure the &s;tates by a barrier: That they &s;hould at the &s;ame time &s;ettle the exerci&s;e of religion in the new conque&s;ts: That they &s;hould a&s;|&s;i&s;t one another with all their forces, in ca&s;e of being invaded by the French king, or any other potentate, on account of this alliance: That a defen&s;ive alliance &s;hould remain between them even after the peace: That all kings, princes, and &s;tates, &s;hould be at liberty to engage in this alliance. They de|termined to employ two months, to obtain, by amicable means, the &s;atisfaction and &s;ecurity which they demanded; and &s;tipulated, that within &s;ix weeks the treaty &s;hould be ratified.</P>

<P>On the &s;ixteenth day of September, king James expired at St. Ger|main's, after having laboured under a tedious indi&s;po&s;ition. This unfortunate monarch, &s;ince the mi&s;carriage of his la&s;t attempt for recovering his throne, had laid a&s;ide all thoughts of worldly grandeur, and devoted his whole attention to the concerns of his &s;oul. Though he could not prevent the bu&s;y genius of his queen from planning new &s;chemes of re&s;toration, he was always be&s;t plea&s;ed when wholly detached from &s;uch chimerical projects. Hunting was his chief diver&s;ion; but religion was his con&s;tant care. Nothing could be more harm|le&s;s than the life he led; and, in the cour&s;e of it, he &s;ubjected him&s;elf to un|common penance and mortification. He frequently vi&s;ited the poor monks of La Trappe, who were much edified by his humble and pious deportment. His pride and arbitrary temper &s;eem to have vani&s;hed with his greatne&s;s. He became affable, kind and ea&s;y to all his dependents; and his religion certainly opened and improved the virtues of his heart, though it &s;eemed to impair the
<PB N="227" REF="2300">
faculties of his &s;oul. In his la&s;t illne&s;s he conjured his &s;on to prefer his religion to every worldly advantage, and even to renounce all thoughts of a crown, if he could not enjoy it without offering violence to his fai h. He recommended to him the practice of ju&s;tice and chri&s;tian forgivene&s;s; he him&s;elf declaring$ that he heartily forgave the prince of Orange, the emperor, and all his ene|mies. He died with great marks of devotion, and was interred, at his own re|que&s;t, in the church of the Engli&s;h Benedictines in Paris, without any funeral &s;olemnity.</P>

<P>Before his death he was vi&s;ited by the French king, who &s;eemed touched with his condition, and declared, that in ca&s;e of his death, he would own his &s;on as king of England. This promi&s;e James's queen had already extorted from him, by the intere&s;t of madam de Maintenon and the dauphin. Accordingly, when James died, the pretended prince of Wales was proclaimed king of England at St. Germain's, and treated as &s;uch at the court of Ver|&s;ailles. His title was likewi&s;e recognized by the king of Spain, the duke of Savoy, and the pope. William was no &s;ooner informed of this tran&s;action, than he di&s;patched a courier to the king of Sweden, as guarantee of the treaty of Ry&s;wick, to complain of this manife&s;t violation. At the &s;ame time, he re|called the earl of Manche&s;ter from Paris, and ordered him to return without taking an audience of leave. That nobleman immediately withdrew, after having intimated to the marquis de Torcy the order he had received. Lewis, in vindication of his own conduct, di&s;per&s;ed through all the courts of Europe, a manife&s;to, in which he affirmed, that in owning the prince of Wales as king of England, he had not infringed any article of the treaty of Ry&s;wick. He confe&s;&s;ed, that in the fourth article, he had promi&s;ed that he would not di&s;turb the king of Great Britain in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dominions; and he declared his intention was to ob&s;erve that promi&s;e punctually. He ob&s;erved, that his genero&s;ity would not allow him to abandon the prince of Wales or his family: that he could not refu&s;e him a title which was due to him by birth: that he had more rea&s;on to complain of the king of Great Britain, and the &s;tates-general, who&s;e declarations and preparations in favour of the emperor might be regarded as real contraventions to treaties: finally, he quoted $ome in&s;tances from hi&s;tory, in which the children enjoyed the titles of kingdoms which their fathers had lo&s;t. The&s;e rea&s;ons, however, would hardly have induced the French king to take &s;uch a &s;tep, had not he perceived that a war with Eng|land was inevitable; and that he &s;hould be able to reap &s;ome advantages in the cour&s;e of it, from e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of the pretender.</P>

<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of the French manife&s;to was publi&s;hed in London by Pou&s;&s;in the &s;ecretary of Tallard, who had been left in England, as agent for the court of Ver&s;ailles. He was now ordered to leave the kingdom, which was filled with indignation at Lewis, for having pretended to declare who ought to be their &s;overeign. The city of London pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the lords-ju&s;tices, expre&s;&s;ing the deepe&s;t re&s;entment of the French king's pre&s;umption; and a&s;&s;uring his maje&s;ty, that they would at all times exert the utmo&s;t of their abilities for the pre&s;ervation of his per&s;on, and the defence of his ju&s;t rights, in oppo&s;ition to all invaders of his crown and dignity. Addre&s;&s;es of the &s;ame nature were &s;ent up from all parts of the kingdom, and could not but be agree|able to William. He had now concerted mea&s;ures for acting with vigour
<PB N="228" REF="2310">
again&s;t France, and re&s;olved to revi&s;it his kingdom, after having made con|&s;iderable progre&s;s in a treaty of perpetual alliance between England and the &s;tates-general, which was afterwards brought to perfection by his plenipotien|tiary the earl of Marlborough. The king's return, however, was delayed a whole month by a &s;evere indi&s;po&s;ition, during which the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter De Quiros hired certain phy&s;icians to con&s;ult together upon the &s;tate and nature of his di&s;temper. They declared that he could not outlive many weeks; and this opinion was tran&s;mitted to Madrid. William, however, baffled the progno&s;tic, though his con&s;titution had &s;u&s;tained &s;uch a rude &s;hock, that he him&s;elf per|ceived his end was near. He told the earl of Portland, he found him&s;elf &s;o weak that he could not expect to live another &s;ummer; but charged him to conceal this circum&s;tance until he &s;hould be dead. Notwith&s;tanding this near approach to di&s;&s;olution, he exerted him&s;elf with &s;urpri&s;ing diligence and &s;pirit in e&s;tabli&s;hing the confederacy, and &s;ettling the plan of operations. A &s;ub|&s;idiary treaty was concluded with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who engaged to furni&s;h a certain number of troops. The emperor agreed to maintain ninety thou&s;and men in the field to act again&s;t France: the proportion of the &s;tates was limited to one hundred and two thou&s;and; and that of England did not exceed forty thou&s;and, to act in conjunction with the allies.</P>

<P>On the fourth day of November the king arrived in England, which he found in a &s;trange ferment, produced from the mutual animo&s;ity of the two factions. They reviled each other in words and writing with all the fal&s;hood of calumny, and all the bitterne&s;s of rancour; &s;o that truth, candour, and temperance, &s;eemed to be bani&s;hed by con&s;ent of both parties. The king had found him&s;elf deceived in his new mini&s;ters, who had oppo&s;ed his mea|&s;ures with all their influence. He was particularly di&s;gu&s;ted with the de|portment of the earl of Roche&s;ter, who proved altogether imperious and un|tractable; and, in&s;tead of moderating, inflamed the violence of his party. The king declared, the year in which that nobleman directed his councils, was the unea&s;ie&s;t of his whole life. He could not help expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;plea&s;ure in &s;uch a coldne&s;s of re&s;erve, that Roche&s;ter told him he would &s;erve his ma|$e&s;ty no longer, &s;ince he did not enjoy his confidence. William made no an&s;wer to this expo&s;tulation, but re&s;olved he &s;hould &s;ee him no more. The earl, however, at the de&s;ire of Mr. Harley, became more pliant and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive; and, after the king's departure for Holland, repaired to his government of Ireland, in which he now remained, exerting all his endeavours to acquire popularity. William fore&s;eeing nothing but oppo&s;ition from the pre&s;ent &s;pirit of the hou&s;e of commons, clo&s;etted &s;ome of their leaders, with a view to be|&s;peak their compliance: but finding them determined to pur&s;ue their former principles, and to in&s;i&s;t upon their impeachments, he re&s;olved, with the ad|vice of his friends, to di&s;&s;olve the parliament. This &s;tep he was the more ea&s;ily induced to take, as the commons were become extremely odious to the na|tion in general, which breathed nothing but war and defiance again&s;t the French monarch. The parliament was accordingly di&s;&s;olved by proclamation, and an|other &s;ummoned to meet on the thirtieth day of December.</P>

<P>Never did the two parties proceed with &s;uch heat and violence again&s;t each other, as in their endeavours to influence the new elections. The Whigs, however, obtained the victory, as they included the monied-intere&s;t,
<PB N="229" REF="2320">
which will always prevail among the borough-electors. Corruption was now reduced into an open and avowed commerce; and, had not the people been &s;o univer&s;ally venal and profligate, that no &s;en&s;e of &s;hame remained, the victors mu&s;t have blu&s;hed for their &s;ucce&s;s. Though the majority thus obtained was &s;taunch to the mea&s;ures of the court, the choice of &s;peaker fell upon Mr. Har|ley, contrary to the inclination of the king, who favoured Sir Thomas Lyttle|ton: but his maje&s;ty's &s;peech was received with univer&s;al applau&s;e. It was &s;o much admired by the well-wi&s;hers to the revolution, that they printed it with decorations, in the Engli&s;h, Dutch, and French languages. It appeared as a piece of furniture in all their hou&s;es, and as the king's la&s;t legacy to his own and all prote&s;tant people. In this celebrated harrangue, he expatiated upon the indignity offered to the nation by the French king's acknowledging the pretended prince of Wales: he explained the dangers to which it was expo&s;ed, by his placing his grand&s;on on the throne of Spain: he gave them to under|&s;tand he had concluded &s;everal alliances, according to the encouragement given him by both hou&s;es of parliament, which alliances &s;hould be layed before them, together with other treaties &s;till depending. He ob&s;erved, that the eyes of all Europe were upon this parliament; and all matters at a &s;tand, until their re&s;olution &s;hould be known: therefore no time ought to be lo&s;t. He told them they had yet an opportunity to &s;ecure for them&s;elves and their po&s;terity the quiet enjoyment of their religion and liberties, if they were not wanting to them&s;elves, but would exert the antient vigour of the Engli&s;h na|tion: but he declared his opinion was, that &s;hould they neglect this occa&s;ion, they had no rea&s;on to hope for another. He &s;aid it would be nece&s;&s;ary to maintain a great &s;trength at &s;ea, and a force at land, proportionable to that of their al|lies. He pre&s;&s;ed the commons to &s;upport the public credit, which could not be pre&s;erved without keeping &s;acred that maxim, That they &s;hall never be lo&s;ers who tru&s;t to a parliamentary &s;ecurity. He declared, that he never a&s;ked aids from his people without regret; that what he de&s;ired was for their own &s;afety and honour, at &s;uch a critical time; and that the whole &s;hould be appropriated to the purpo&s;es for which it was intended. He expre&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s that the accounts &s;hould be yearly &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection of parliament. He again recommended di&s;patch, together with good bills for employing the poor, encouraging trade, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing vice. He expre&s;&s;ed his hope that they were come together determined to avoid di&s;putes and differences, and to act with a hearty concurrence for promoting the common cau&s;e. He &s;aid he &s;hould think it as great a ble&s;&s;ing as could befal England, if they were as much inclined to lay a&s;ide tho&s;e unhappy fatal animo&s;ities which divided and weakened them, as he was di&s;po&s;ed to make all his &s;ubjects &s;afe and ea&s;y, as to any, even the highe&s;t offences committed again&s;t his per&s;on. He conjured them to di&s;|appoint the hopes of their enemies by their unanimity. As he had always &s;hewn, and always would &s;hew$ how de&s;irous he was to be the common father of all his people, he de&s;ired they would lay a&s;ide parties and divi&s;ions, &s;o as that no di&s;tinc|tions &s;hould be heard of among&s;t them, but of tho&s;e who were friends to the prote&s;tant religion and pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, and of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed for a popi&s;h prince and a French government. He concluded by affirming, that if they, in good earne&s;t, de&s;ired to &s;ee England hold the balance of Europe, and be indeed at the head of the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, it would appea$ by their improving the pre&s;ent opportunity. The lords immediately drew up a warm and affectionate
<PB N="230" REF="2330">
addre&s;s, in which they expre&s;&s;ed their re&s;entment of the proceedings of the French king, in owning the pretended prince of Wales for king of England. They a&s;&s;ured his maje&s;ty they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him to the utmo&s;t of their power again&s;t all his enemies; and, when it &s;hould plea&s;e God to deprive them of his maje&s;ty's protection, they would vigorou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;t and defend again&s;t the pretended prince of Wales, and all other pretenders what&s;oever, every per&s;on and per&s;ons who had right to &s;ucceed to the crown of England, by virtue of the acts of parliament for e&s;tabli&s;hing and limiting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. On the fifth day of January, an addre&s;s to the &s;ame effect was pre&s;ented by the com|mons, and both met with a very gracious reception from his maje&s;ty. The lords, as a further proof of their zeal, having taken into con&s;ideration the dan|gers that threatened Europe, from the acce&s;&s;ion of the duke of Anjou to the crown of Spain, drew up another addre&s;s, explaining their &s;en&s;e of that dan|ger; &s;tigmati&s;ing the French king as a violator of treaties; declaring their opinion, that his maje&s;ty, his &s;ubjects, and allies, could never be &s;afe and &s;e|cure, until the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria &s;hould be re&s;tored to their rights, and the in|vader of the Spani&s;h monarchy brought to rea&s;on; and a&s;&s;uring his maje&s;ty that no time &s;hould be lo&s;t, nor any thing wanting on their parts, which might an&s;wer the rea&s;onable expectations of their friends abroad; not doubting but to &s;upport the reputation of the Engli&s;h name, when engaged under &s;o great a prince, in the glorious cau&s;e of maintaining the liberty of Europe.</P>

<P>The king, in order to acquire the confidence of the commons, ordered Mr. &s;ecretary Ver$on to lay before them, copies of the treaties and conventions he had lately concluded, which were &s;o well approved that the hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly voted the &s;upply. By another vote, they authori&s;ed the exchequer to borrow &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds at &s;ix per cent. for the &s;ervice of the fleet, and fifty thou&s;and pounds for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of guards and garri&s;ons. They deliberated upon the &s;tate of the navy, with the debt due upon it, and examined an e&s;timate of what would be nece&s;&s;ary for extraordi|nary repairs. They called for an account of that part of the national debt for which no provi&s;ion had been made. They ordered the &s;peaker to write to the tru&s;tees for the forfeited e&s;tates in Ireland, to attend the hou&s;e with a full detail of their proceedings in the execution of that act of parliament. On the ninth day of January, they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, That leave be given to bring in a bill for &s;ecuring his maje&s;ty's per&s;on, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the prote&s;tant line, for extingui&s;hing the hopes of the pretended prince of Wales, and all other pretenders, and their open and &s;ecret abettors. They re&s;olved to addre&s;s his maje&s;ty, that he would in&s;ert an article in all his treaties of alliance, importing, That no peace &s;hould be made with France, until his maje&s;ty and the nation have reparation for the great indignity offered by the French king, in owning and declaring the pretended prince of Wales king of England, Scot|land, and Ireland. They agreed to maintain forty thou&s;and men for the &s;ea|&s;ervice, and a like number by land, to act in conjunction with the forces of the allies, according to the proportions &s;ettled by the contracting powers. The &s;upplies were rai&s;ed by an impo&s;ition of four &s;hillings in the pound upon lands, annuities, pen&s;ions, and &s;tipends, and on the profits ari&s;ing from the different profe&s;&s;ions: by a tax of two and one half per cent. on all &s;tock in trade, and money at intere&s;t; of five &s;hillings in the pound on all &s;alaries, fees, and per|qui&s;ites; a capitation tax of four &s;hillings; an impo&s;ition of one per cent. on

all &s;hares in the capital &s;tock of any corporation or company which &s;hould be bought, &s;old, or bargained for: a duty of &s;ixpence per bu&s;hel on malt, and a further duty on mum, cyder, and perry.</P>

<P>The commons &s;eemed to vie with the lords in their zeal for the go|vernment. They brought in a bill for attainting the pretended prince of Wales, which being &s;ent up to the other hou&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed with an additional clau&s;e of attainder again&s;t the queen, who acted as regent for the pretender. This, however, was not carried without great oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of lords. When the bill was &s;ent back to the commons, they excepted to the amendment as ir|regular. They ob&s;erved, that attainders by bill con&s;tituted the mo&s;t rigorous part of the law; and, that the &s;tretching of it ought to be avoided. They pro|po&s;ed, that the queen &s;hould be attainted by a &s;eparate bill. The lords a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al: the bill again&s;t the pretended prince of Wales pa&s;&s;ed. The lords pa&s;&s;ed another for attainting the queen; however, it was neglected in the hou&s;e of commons. But, the longe&s;t and warme&s;t debates of this &s;e&s;&s;ion were produced by a bill, which the lords brought in for abjuring the pretended prince of Wales, and &s;wearing to the king, by title of Rightful and lawful king, and his heirs, according to the act of &s;ettlement. It was propo&s;ed, that this oath &s;hould be voluntary, tendered to all per&s;ons, and their &s;ub&s;cription or re|fu&s;al recorded, without any other penalty. This article was violently oppo&s;ed by the earl of Nottingham, and other lords of the Tory-intere&s;t. They ob&s;erved, that the government was fir&s;t &s;ettled with another oath, which was like an ori|ginal contract; &s;o that there was no occa&s;ion for a new impo&s;ition: that oaths relating to men's opinions had been always con&s;idered as &s;evere impo&s;itions: and, that a voluntary oath was in its own nature unlawful. During the&s;e di&s;|putes, another bill of abjuration was brought into the hou&s;e of commons by Sir Charles Hedges, that &s;hould be obligatory on all per&s;ons who enjoyed em|ployments in church or &s;tate; it likewi&s;e included an obligation to maintain the government, in king, lords, and commons, and to maintain the church of Eng|land, together with the toleration for di&s;&s;enters. Warm debates aro&s;e upon the que&s;tion, Whether the oath &s;hould be impo&s;ed or voluntary? and at length, it was carried for impo&s;ition, by the majority of one voice. They agreed to in&s;ert an additional clau&s;e, declaring it equally penal to compa&s;s or imagine the death of her royal highne&s;s the prince&s;s Anne of Denmark, as it was to compa&s;s or ima|gine the death of the king's elde&s;t &s;on and heir. In the hou&s;e of peers this bill was &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the Tories; and, when after long debates it pa&s;&s;ed on the twenty-fourth day of February, ten lords entered a prote&s;t again&s;t it as an unnece&s;&s;ary and &s;evere impo&s;ition.</P>

<P>The whole nation now &s;eemed to join in the cry for a war with France. Party-heats began to abate; the factions in the city of London were in a great mea&s;ure moderated by the union of the two companies trading to the Ea&s;t-Indies, which found their mutual intere&s;t required a coalition. The To|ries in the hou&s;e of commons having concurred &s;o heartily with the inclinations of the people, re&s;olved, as far as it lay in their power, to ju&s;tify the conduct of their party in the preceding parliament. They complained of &s;ome petitions and addre&s;&s;es which had reflected upon the proceedings of the la&s;t hou&s;e of commons, and particularly, of the Kenti&s;h petition. The majority, however, determined, that it was the undoubted right of the people of England, to pe|tition
<PB N="232" REF="2350">
or addre&s;s to the king, for the calling, &s;itting, or di&s;&s;olving of parliaments, and for the redre&s;&s;ing of g$$evances; and, that every &s;ubject under any accu&s;ation, e$ther by impeachment or otherwi&s;e, had a right to be brought to a &s;peedy trial. A complaint be$ng likewi&s;e made, that the lords had denied the commons $$$$ice in the matter of the late impeachments, a furious debate en&s;ued; and it $as carried by a very &s;mall majority, that ju&s;tice had not been denied. In &s;ome $word$ however, the$ &s;ucceeded. In the ca&s;e of a controverted election at Mai$&s;$one, between Thomas B$$&s;&s;e and Thomas Culpepper, the hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the latter had been not only guilty of corrupt, &s;candalous, and indirect practices, in endeavouring to procure him&s;elf to be elected a burge&s;s, but like|wi&s;e, being one of the in&s;truments in promoting and pre&s;enting the &s;canda|ious, in&s;olent, and &s;editious petition, commonly called the Kenti&s;h petition, to the la&s;t hou&s;e of commons, was guilty of promoting a &s;candalous, villanous, and groundle&s;s reflection upon that hou&s;e, by a&s;per&s;ing the members with receiving French money, or being in the intere&s;t of France; for which offence he was ordered to be committed to Newgate, and to be pro&s;ecuted by his maje&s;ty's attorney-general. They al&s;o re&s;olved, That to a&s;&s;ert that the hou&s;e of com|mons is not the only repre&s;entative of the commons of England, tends to the $ubver&s;ion of the rights and privileges of the hou&s;e of commons, and the fun|damental con&s;titution of the government of this kingdom: That to a&s;&s;ert, that the hou&s;e of commons have no power of commitment, but of their own mem|bers, tends to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution of the hou&s;e of commons: That to print or publi&s;h any books, or libels, reflecting upon the proceedings of the hou&s;e of commons, or any member thereof, for, or relating to his &s;ervice therein, is a high violation of the rights and privileges of the hou&s;e of com|mons. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e tran&s;actions, they did not neglect the vigorous pro&s;ecution of the war. They addre&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty to interpo&s;e with his allies, that they might increa&s;e their quotas of land$forces, to be put on board the $$eet in proportion to the numbers his maje&s;ty &s;hould embark. When they had &s;ettled the &s;ums appropriated to the &s;everal u&s;es of the war, they pre&s;ented a &s;econd addre&s;s, de&s;iring he would provide for the half-pay officers in the fir&s;t place, in the recruits and levies to be made. The king a&s;&s;ured them, it was always his intention to provide for tho&s;e officers. He went to the hou&s;e of peers, and gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to an act, appointing commi&s;&s;ioners to take, examine, and determine the debts due to the army, navy, and the tran&s;port|&s;ervice; and al&s;o an account of prizes taken during the war.</P>

<P>The affairs of Ireland were not a little embarra&s;&s;ed by the conduct of the tru&s;tees appointed to take cognizance of the forfeited e&s;tates. Their office was extremely odious to the people, as well as to the court, and their de|portment was arbitrary and imperious. Several individuals of that king|dom, provoked by the in&s;olence of the tru&s;tees on one hand, and encouraged by the countenance of the courtiers on the other, endeavoured by a circular letter, to &s;pirit up the grand-jury of Ireland again&s;t the act of re&s;umption; and petitions were pre&s;ented to the king, couched in very &s;trong terms, affirm|ing, that it was injurious to the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, and had been obtained by gro&s;s mi&s;informations. The king having communicated the&s;e addre&s;&s;es to the hou&s;e, they were immediately voted &s;candalous, fal&s;e, and groundle&s;s; and the com|mons re&s;olved, That notwith&s;tanding the complaints and clamours again&s;t the

tru&s;tees, it did not appear to the hou&s;e but tho&s;e complaints were groundle&s;s; neverthele&s;s, they afterwards received &s;everal petitions, imploring relief again&s;t the &s;aid act; and they ordered that the petitioners &s;hould be relieved accordingly. Propo&s;als were delivered in for incorporating &s;uch as &s;hould purcha&s;e the &s;aid forfeitures, on certain terms therein &s;pecified, according to the rent-roll, when verified and made good to the purcha&s;ers; but, whereas in this rent-roll the valu$ of the e&s;tates had been e&s;timated at &s;omething more than &s;even hundred and &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds, tho&s;e who undertook to make the purcha&s;e, af|firmed, they were not worth five hundred thou&s;and pounds: and thus the affair remained in &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to Scotland, the clamours of that kingdom had not yet &s;ub&s;ided. When the bill of abjuration pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of peers, the earl of Nottingham had declared, that although he differed in opinion from the majority in many particulars relating to that bill, yet he was a friend to the de|&s;ign of it; and, in order to &s;ecure a prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he thought an union of the whole i&s;land was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. He therefore moved for an addre&s;s to the king, that he would di&s;&s;olve the parliament of Scotland now &s;itting, as the legality of it might be called in que&s;tion, on account of its having been origi|nally a convention; and, that a new parliam$nt &s;hould be &s;ummoned, that they might treat about an union of the two kingdoms. The king had this affair &s;o much at heart, that even when he was di&s;abled from going to the parlia|ment in per&s;on, he &s;ent a letter to the commons, expre&s;&s;ing an eager de&s;ire that a treaty for this purpo&s;e might be &s;et on foot, and earne&s;tly recommended this affair to the con&s;ideration of the hou&s;e. But, as a new parliament in Scotland could not be called without a great ri&s;que, while the nation was in &s;uch a fer|ment, the project was po&s;tponed to a more favourable opportunity.</P>

<P>Before the king's return from Holland, he had concerted with his allies the operations of the en&s;uing campaign. He had engaged in a ne|gotiation with the prince of He&s;&s;e-D'Arm&s;tadt, who a&s;&s;ured him, that if he would be&s;iege and take Cadiz, the admiral of Ca&s;tile and divers other grandees of Spain, would declare for the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The allies had al&s;o determined upon the &s;iege of Key$er&s;waert, which the elector of Cologne had delivered into the hands of the French: the elector of Hanover had re&s;olved to di&s;arm the princes of Wolfembuttle: the king of the Romans and prince Lewis of Baden, undertook to inve&s;t Landau; and the emperor promi&s;ed to &s;end a powerful rein|forcement to prince Eugene in Italy; but, William did not live to &s;ee the&s;e &s;chemes put in execution. His con&s;titution was by this time almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, tho' he endea|voured to conceal the effects of his malady, and to repair his health by exerci&s;e. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of February, in riding to Hampton-court from Ken&s;ington, his hor&s;e fell under him, and he him&s;elf was thrown upon the ground with &s;uch violence, as produced a fracture in his collar bone. His attendants conveyed him to the palace of Hampton-court, where the fracture was reduced by Ronjat his &s;erjeant$&s;urgeon. In the evening he returned to Ken&s;ington in his coach, and the two ends of the fractured bone having been di&s;united by the jolting of the carriage, were replaced under the in&s;pection of Bidloo his phy&s;ician. He &s;eemed to be in a fair way of recovering till the fir&s;t day of March, when his knee &s;eemed to be inflamed, with great pain and weakne&s;s. Next day he granted a commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal to &s;everal peers, for pa&s;&s;ing the bills to which

both hou&s;es of parliament had agreed, namely, the act of attainder again&s;t the pr$$$nded prince of Wales; and another in favour of the Quakers, enacting, T$at their &s;olemn affirmation and declaration &s;hould be accepted in&s;tead of an oath in the u&s;ual form.</P>

<P>On the fourth day of March the king was &s;o well recovered of his lamene&s;s, that he took &s;everal turns in the gallery at Ken&s;ington; but, &s;itting down on a couch where he fe$l a&s;leep, he was &s;eized with a &s;hivering, which terminated in a fever and diarrhoea. He was attended by Sir Thomas Milling|$on, Sir Richard Blackmore, Sir Theodore Colledon, Dr. Bidloo, and other eminent phy&s;icians; but, their pre&s;criptions proved ineffectual. On the &s;ixth he granted another commi&s;&s;ion for pa&s;&s;ing the bill for the malt-tax, and the act of abjuration: and, being &s;o weak that he could not write his name, he, in pre&s;ence of the lord-keeper and the clerks of parliament, applied a &s;tamp pre|pared for the purpo&s;e. The earl of Albemarle arriving from Holland, confer|red with him in private on the po&s;ture of affairs abroad; but, he received his infor|mations with great coldne&s;s, and &s;aid, "Je $ire vers ma fin." <Q>&startq;I approach the end of life.&endq;</Q> In the evening he thanked Dr. Bidloo for his care and tenderne&s;s, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;I know that you and the other learned phy&s;icians have done all that your art can do for my relief; but, fi$ding all means ineffectual, I &s;ubmit.&endq;</Q> He received &s;piritual con&s;olation from archbi&s;hop Teni&s;on, and Burnet bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury: on Sunday morning the &s;acrament was admini&s;tered to him. The lords of the privy$council, and divers noblemen attended in the adjoining apartments, and to &s;ome of them who were admitted, he &s;poke a little. He thanked lord Overkirk for his long and faithful &s;ervices: he delivered to lord Albemarle the keys of his clo&s;et and &s;crutore, telling him, he knew what to do with them. He inquired for the earl of Portland; but, being &s;peechle&s;s before that nobleman arrived, he gra&s;ped his hand$ and laid it to his heart with marks of the mo&s;t tender affection. On the eighth day of March he expired, in the fifty-&s;econd year of his age, after having reigned thirteen years. The lords Lexington and Scarborough, who were in waiting, no &s;ooner perceived the king was dead, than they ordered Ronjat to untie from his left arm a black ribbon, to which was affixed a ring, containing &s;ome hair of the late queen Mary. The body being opened and embalmed, lay in &s;tate for &s;ome time at Ken&s;ington; and on the twelfth day of April was depo&s;ited in a vault of Henry's chapel in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey. In the beginning of May, a will which he had intru&s;ted with mon&s;ieur Schuylemberg, was opened at the Hague. In this he had declared his cou&s;in prince Fri&s;on of Na&s;&s;au, &s;tadtholder of Frie&s;land, his &s;ole and univer&s;al heir, and appointed the &s;tates-general his executors. By a codicil an|nexed, he had bequeathed the lord&s;hip of Breevert, and a legacy of two hun|dred thou&s;and guilders, to the earl of Albemarle.</P>

<P>William III. was in his per&s;on of the middle &s;tature, a thin body and delicate con&s;titution, &s;ubject to an $&s;thma and continual cough from his in|fancy. He had an aquiline no&s;e, &s;park$$ng eyes, a large forehead and a grave &s;olemn a&s;pect. He was very &s;paring of &s;pe$ch: his conver&s;ation was dry, and his manner di&s;gu&s;ting, except in battle, when h$$ deportment was free, &s;pirited, and animating. In courage, fortitude, and equanimity, he rivalled the mo&s;t $minent warr$ors of antiquity; and his natural &s;agacity made amends for the defects in his education, which had not been properly &s;uperintended. He was
<PB N="235" REF="2380">
religious, temperate, generally ju&s;t and &s;incere, a &s;tranger to violent tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion, and might have pa&s;&s;ed for one of the be&s;t princes of the age in which he lived, had he never a&s;cended the throne of Great-Britain. But, the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing criterion of his character was ambition. To this he &s;acrificed the punctilios of honour and decorum, in depo&s;ing his own father-in-law and uncle; and this he gratified at the expence of the nation that rai&s;ed him to &s;overeign authority. He a&s;pired to the honour of acting as umpire in all the conte&s;ts of Europe; and the &s;econd object of his attention was, the pro&s;perity of that country to which he owed his birth and extraction. Whether he really thought the intere&s;ts of the continent and Great-Britain were in&s;eparable, or &s;ought only to drag England into the confederacy as a convenient ally, certain it is, he in|volved the&s;e kingdoms in foreign connexions, which, in all probability, will be productive of their ruin. In order to e&s;tabli&s;h this favourite point, he &s;crupled not to employ all the engines of corruption, by which the morals of the nation were totally debauched. He procured a parliamentary &s;anction for a &s;tanding army, which now &s;eems to be interwoven in the con&s;titution. He introduced the pernicious practice of borrowing upon remote funds; an expedient that ne|ce&s;&s;arily hatched a brood of u&s;urers, brokers, and &s;tock-jobbers, to prey upon the vitals of their country. He intailed upon the nation a growing debt, and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Boyer. Lamberty. State Tracts. Tindal. Ralph.

To &s;um up his character in a few words: William was a fatali&s;t in religion, indefatigable in war, enterpri&s;ing in politics, dead to all the warm and g$nerous emotions of the human heart, a cold relation, an indifferent hu&s;band, a di&s;agreeable man, an ungracious prince, and an imperious &s;overeign.</P>

<P>WILLIAM was &s;ucceeded as &s;overeign of England, by Anne prince&s;s of Denmark, who a&s;cended the throne in the thirty-eighth year of her age, to the general &s;atisfaction of all parties. Even the Jacobites &s;eemed plea&s;ed with her elevation, on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that as in all probability &s;he would leave no heirs of her own body, the dictates of natu|ral affection would induce her to alter the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in favour of her own bro|ther. She had been taught to cheri&s;h warm &s;entiments of the Tories, whom &s;he con&s;idered as the friends of monarchy, and the true &s;ons of the church; and they had always profe&s;&s;ed an inviolable attachment to her per&s;on and intere&s;t;
<PB N="237" REF="2400">
but, her conduct was wholly influenced by the counte&s;s of Marlborough, a wo|man of an imperious temper and intriguing genius, who had been intimate with the prince&s;s from her tender years, and gained a &s;urpri&s;ing a&s;cendancy over her &s;pirit. Anne had undergone &s;ome &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune in con&s;equence of her father's expul&s;ion, and &s;u&s;tained a variety of mortifications in the late reign, during which &s;he conducted her&s;elf with &s;uch di&s;cretion, as left little or no pretence for cen&s;ure or re&s;entment. Such conduct, indeed, was in a great mea&s;ure owing to a natural temperance of di&s;po&s;ition, not ea&s;ily ruffled or in|flamed. She was zealou&s;ly devoted to the church of England, from which her father had u&s;ed &s;ome endeavours to detach her before the revolution; and &s;he lived in great harmony with her hu&s;band, to whom &s;he bore &s;ix children, all of whom &s;he had already &s;urvived. William had no &s;ooner yielded up his breath, than the privy-council in a body waited on the new queen, who, in a &s;hort but &s;en|&s;ible &s;peech, a&s;&s;ured them, that no pains nor diligence &s;hould be wanting on her part, to pre&s;erve and &s;upport the religion, laws, and liberties of her country, to maintain the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant line, and the government in church and &s;tate, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. She declared her re&s;olution to carry on the prepa|rations for oppo&s;ing the exorbitant power of France, and to a&s;&s;ure the allies, that &s;he would pur&s;ue the true intere&s;t of England, together with theirs, for the &s;up|port of the common cau&s;e. The members of the privy-council having taken the oaths, &s;he ordered a proclamation to be publi&s;hed, &s;ignifying her plea&s;ure, that all per&s;ons in office of authority or government, at the decea&s;e of the late king, &s;hould &s;o continue till further directions. By virtue of an act pa&s;&s;ed in the late reign, the parliament continued &s;itting even after the king's death. Both hou&s;es met immediately, and unanimou&s;ly voted an addre&s;s of condolance and congratulation; and, in the afternoon the queen was proclaimed. Next day the lords and commons &s;everally attended her with an addre&s;s, congratu|lating her maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; and, a&s;&s;uring her of their firm re|&s;olution to &s;upport her again&s;t all her enemies what&s;oever. The lords acknow|ledged, that their great lo&s;s was no otherwi&s;e to be repaired but by a vigorous adherence to her maje&s;ty and her allies, in the pro&s;ecution of tho&s;e mea&s;ures already concerted to reduce the exorbitant power of France. The commons declared, they would maintain the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the prote&s;tant line, and effectually provide for the public credit of the nation. The&s;e addre&s;&s;es were graciou&s;ly received by the queen, who, on the eleventh day of March went to the hou&s;e of peers with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity, where, in a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her &s;atisfaction at their unanimous concurrence with her opinion, that too much could not be done for the encouragement of their allies in hum|bling the power of France; and, de&s;ired they would con&s;ider of proper me|thods towards obtaining an union between England and Scotland. She ob&s;erved to the commons, that the revenue for defraying the expences of the civil go|vernment, was expired: and, that &s;he relied intirely on their affection for its being &s;upplied in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould be mo&s;t &s;uitable to the honour and dignity of the crown. She declared, it &s;hould be her con&s;tant endeavour to make them the be&s;t return for their duty and affection, by a careful and diligent admini&s;tration for the good of all her &s;ubjects. <Q>&startq;And as I know my own heart to be entirely Engli&s;h (continued &s;he) I can very &s;incerely a&s;&s;ure you, there is not any thing you can expect or de&s;ire from me, which I &s;hall not be ready to

<P>William's death was no &s;ooner known at the Hague, than all Holland was filled with con&s;ternation. The &s;tates immediately a&s;&s;embled, and for &s;ome time gazed at each other in &s;ilent fear and a&s;toni&s;hment. They &s;ighed, wept, interchanged embraces and vows, that they would act with unanimity, and ex|pend their deare&s;t blood in defence of their country. Then they di&s;patched letters to the cities and provinces, informing them of this unfortunate event, and exhorting them to union and per&s;everance. The expre&s;s from England having brought the queen's &s;peech to her privy-council, it was tran&s;lated and publi&s;hed, to revive the drooping &s;pirits of the people. Next day pen&s;ionary Fagel imparted to the &s;tates of Holland a letter which he had received from the earl of Marlborough, containing a&s;&s;urances in the queen's name of union and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In a few days, the queen wrote a letter in the French language to the &s;tates, confirming the&s;e a&s;&s;urances; and, it was delivered by Mr. Stanhope, who was now furni&s;hed with fre&s;h credentials as envoy from England. Thus animated, the &s;tates re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute vigorous mea&s;ures; and their re&s;olu|tions were &s;till more in&s;pirited by the arrival of the earl of Marlborough, whom the queen honoured with the order of the garter, and inve&s;ted with the cha|racter of amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary, and plenipotentiary to the &s;tates general: he was likewi&s;e declared captain-general of her forces both at home and abroad. He a&s;&s;ured the &s;tates, that her Britannic maje&s;ty would maintain the alliances which had been concluded by the late king, and do every thing that the com|mon concerns of Europe required. The &s;peech was an&s;wered by Dickvelt pre|&s;ident of the week, who, in the name of the &s;tates, expre&s;&s;ed their hearty thanks to her maje&s;ty, and their re&s;olution of concurring with her in a vigorous pro&s;e|cution of the common intere&s;t.</P>

<P>The importance of William's life was evinced by the joy that diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through the kingdom of France at the news of his decea&s;e. The per&s;on who fir&s;t brought the tidings to Calais was impri&s;oned by the governor, until his information was confirmed. The court of Ver&s;ailles could hardly re&s;train their tran&s;ports &s;o as to pre&s;erve common decorum: the people of Paris openly rejoiced at the event; all decency was layed a&s;ide at Rome, where this incident produced &s;uch indecent raptures, that cardinal Grimani the Imperial mini&s;ter complained of them to the pope, as an in&s;ult on his ma&s;ter the emperor, who was William's friend, confederate, and ally. The French king di&s;patched cre|dentials to Barre, whom the count D'Avaux had left at the Hague to manage the affairs of France, together with in&s;tructions to renew the negotiation with the &s;tates, in hope of detaching them from the alliance. This mini&s;ter pre&s;ented a memorial, implying &s;evere reflections on king William and the pa&s;t conduct of the Dutch; and in&s;inuating, that now they had recovered their liberty, the court of France hoped they would con&s;ult their true intere&s;t. The count de

Goes envoy from the emperor, animadverted on the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions in another memorial, which was likewi&s;e publi&s;hed; and, the &s;tates produced in public an an&s;wer to the &s;ame remon&s;trance, expre&s;&s;ing their re&s;entment at the in&s;olence of &s;uch in&s;inuations, and their veneration for the memory of their late $tadtholder. The earl of Marlborough &s;ucceeded in every part of his negotiation. He ani|mated the Dutch to a full exertion of their vigour: he concerted the operations of the campaign: he agreed with the &s;tates-general and the imperial mini&s;ter, that war &s;hould be declared again&s;t France on the &s;ame day, at Vienna, London, and the Hague; and, on the third day of April embarked for England, after having acquired the intire confidence of tho&s;e who governed the United Pro|vinces.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1702.</NOTE> By this time the hou&s;e of commons in England had &s;ettled the civil li&s;t upon the queen for her life; and, when the bill received the royal a&s;&s;ent, &s;he a&s;&s;ured them, that one hundred thou&s;and pounds of this revenue &s;hould be applied to the public &s;ervice of the current year: at the &s;ame time, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed another bill for receiving and examining the public accounts. A commi&s;&s;ion for this purpo&s;e was granted in the preceding reign, but had been for &s;ome years di&s;continued; and indeed, always proved ineffectual to detect and puni&s;h tho&s;e individuals, who &s;hamefully pillaged their country. The villany was &s;o com|plicated, the vice &s;o general, and the delinquent &s;o powerfully &s;creened by artifice and intere&s;t, as to elude all inquiry. On the twenty-fourth day of March the oath of abjuration was taken by the &s;peaker and members, according to an act for the further &s;ecurity of her maje&s;ty's per&s;on, and the &s;u$ce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the prote&s;tant line, and for extingui&s;hing the hopes of the pretended prince of Wales. The queen's inclination to the Tories plainly appeared in her choice of mini&s;ters. Doctor John Sharp, archbi&s;hop of York, became her gho&s;tly di|rector and coun&s;ellor in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. The earl of Roche&s;ter was con|tinued lord lieutenant of Ireland, and enjoyed a great &s;hare of her maje&s;ty's confidence: the privy-&s;eal was intru&s;ted to the marquis of Normanby: the earl of Nottingham and Sir Charles Hedges were appointed &s;ecretaries of &s;tate: the earl of Abingdon, Vi&s;count Weymouth, lord Dartmouth, Sir Chri&s;topher Mu&s;|grave, Greenvil, Howe, Gower, and Harcourt, were admitted as members of the privy-council, together with Sir Edward Seymour, now declared comp|troller of the hou&s;hold. The lord Godolphin declined accepting the office of lord high-trea&s;urer, until he was over-ruled by the per&s;ua&s;ions of Marlborough, to who&s;e elde&s;t daughter his &s;on was married. This nobleman refu&s;ed to command the forces abroad, unle&s;s the trea&s;ury &s;hould be put into the hands of Godol|phin, on who&s;e punctuality in point of remittances he knew he could depend. George, prince of Denmark, was inve&s;ted with the title of generali&s;&s;imo of all the queen's forces by &s;ea and land; and, afterwards created lord high-admiral: the earl of Pembroke having been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from this office with the offer of a large pen&s;ion, which he generou&s;ly refu&s;ed. Prince George, as admiral, was a&s;&s;i$ted by a council, con&s;i&s;ting of Sir George Rooke, Sir David Mitchel, George Churchil, and Richard Hill. Though the legality of this board was doubted, the parliament had &s;uch re&s;pect and veneration for the queen, that it was &s;uf|fered to act without que&s;tion.</P>

<P>A rival&s;hip for the queen's favour already appeared between the earls of Roche&s;ter and Marlborough. The former, as fir&s;t cou&s;in to the queen, and
<PB N="240" REF="2430">
chief of the To$y faction, maintained con&s;iderable influence in the council: but even there the intere&s;t of his rival predominated. Marlborough was not only the better courtier, but, by the canal of his counte&s;s, actually directed the queen in all her re&s;olutions. Roche&s;ter propo&s;ed in council, that the Engli&s;h &s;hould avoid a declaration of war with France, and act as auxiliaries only. He was &s;econded by &s;ome other members: but the opinion of Marlborough preponderated. He ob&s;erved, that the honour of the nation was concerned to fulfil the late king's engagements; and affirmed that France could never be reduced within due bounds, unle&s;s the Engli&s;h would enter as principals in the qu$rrel. This allegation was &s;upported by the dukes of Somer&s;et and Devon|&s;hire, the earl of Pembroke, and the majority of the council. The queen re|&s;olved to declare war, and communicated her intention to the hou&s;e of com|mons, by whom it was approved; and, on the fourth day of May, the de|claration was &s;olemnly proclaimed. The king of France was, in this pro$la|mation, taxed with having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great part of the Spani&s;h do|minions; with de&s;igning to invade the liberties of Europe; to ob&s;truct the freedom of navigation and commerce; and with having offered an unpardon|able in&s;ult to the queen and her throne, by taking upon him to declare the pretended prince of Wales king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The three declarations of the emperor, England, and the &s;tates-general, which were publi&s;hed in one day, did not fail to di&s;con$ert, as well as to provoke, the French monarch. When his mini&s;ter de Tor$y recited them in his hearing, he &s;poke of the queen with &s;ome acrimony; but with re&s;pect to the &s;tates-ge|neral, he declared with great emotion, that <Q>&startq;Me&s;&s;ieurs the Dutch merchants &s;hould one day repent of their in&s;olence and pre&s;umption, in declaring war again&s;t &s;o powerful a monarch:&endq;</Q> he did not, however, produce his declara|tion till the third day of July.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e of commons, in compliance with the queen's de&s;ire, brought in a bill, empowering her maje&s;ty to name commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the Scots for an union of the two kingdoms. It met with warm oppo&s;ition from Sir Edward Seymour, and other Tory members, who di&s;charged abundance of &s;a|tire and ridicule upon the Scotti&s;h nation; but the mea&s;ure &s;eemed &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at that juncture, to &s;ecure the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion again&s;t the practices of France, and the claims of the pretender, that the majority e&s;pou&s;ed the bill, which pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, and, on the &s;ixth day of May received the royal a&s;&s;ent, to$ether with &s;ome bills of le&s;s importance. The enemies of the late king continued to revile his memory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In their ho$rs of debanch, they drank to the health of sorre$, meaning the ho$&s;e that fell with the king; and, under the appeliation of the little gentleman in velvet, to$$ted the mole that rai&s;ed the h$ll over which the hor&s;e had &s;tumbled. As he had formerly belonged to Sir John Fenwick, they infinuated that William's fate was a judg|ment upon him for his cr$elty to that gentleman; and a La$in epigram was written on the oc|ca$$on.</NOTE>. They even charged him with having formed a de&s;ign of excluding the prince&s;s Anne from the throne, and of introducing the elector of Hanover as his own immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or.

<P>In Scotland, a warm conte&s;t aro&s;e between the revolutioners and tho&s;e in the oppo&s;ition, concerning the exi&s;tence of the pre&s;ent parliament. The queen had &s;ignified her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, in a letter to her privy-council for Scotland, de&s;iring they would continue to act in that office until &s;he &s;hould &s;end a new commi&s;&s;ion, authori&s;ing them to publi&s;h a proclamation, ordaining all officers of &s;tate, coun&s;ellors, and magi&s;trates, to act in all things conformably to the commi&s;&s;ions and in&s;tructions they had from his late maje&s;ty, until new commi&s;&s;ions could be prepared. She likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured them of her firm re&s;olu|tion to protect them in their religion, laws, and liberties, and in the e&s;tabli&s;hed government of the church. She had already, in pre&s;ence of twelve Scotti&s;h coun&s;ellors, taken the coronation-oath for that kingdom: but tho&s;e who wanted to embroil the affairs of their country, affirmed, that this was an irregular way of proceeding, and that the oath ought to have been tendered by per&s;ons deputed for that purpo&s;e, either by the parliament, or the privy-council of the kingdom. The pre&s;ent mini&s;try, con&s;i&s;ting of the duke of Queen&s;berry, the earls of March|mont,
<PB N="242" REF="2450">
Melvil$ Seafield, Hyndford$ and Selkirk, were devoted to revolution-prin|ciples$ and de&s;irous that the parliament &s;hould continue, in pur&s;uance of a late act for continuing the parliament that &s;hould be then in being, &s;ix months after the death of the king$ and that it &s;hould a&s;&s;emble in twenty days after that event. The queen had$ by &s;everal adjournments, deferred the meeting almo&s;t three months after the king's decea&s;e; and therefore the anti-r$volutioners af|firmed that it was di&s;&s;olved. The duke of Hamilton was at the head of this party, which clamoured loudly for a new parliament. This nobleman, to|gether with the marquis of Tweedale, the earls Mar&s;hal and Rothes, and many other noblemen, repaired to London, in order to make the queen acquainted with their objections to the continuance of the pre&s;ent parliament. She ad|mitted them to her pre&s;ence, and calmly heard their allegations: but &s;he was d$$ermined, by the advice of her privy-council for that kingdom, who were of opinion that the nation was in too great a ferment to hazard the convoca|tion of a new parliament. According to the queen's la&s;t adjournment, the parliament met at Edinburgh on the ninth day of June, the duke of Queen&s;berry having been appointed high commi&s;&s;ioner. Before the queen's commi&s;&s;ion was read, the Duke of Hamilton, for him&s;elf and his adherents, declared their &s;a|tisfaction at her maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, not only on account of her undoubted right by de&s;cent, but likewi&s;e becau&s;e of her many per&s;onal virtues and royal qualities. He &s;aid they were re&s;olved to &s;acrifice their lives and for|tunes in defence of her maje&s;ty's right again&s;t all her enemies whatever; but, at the &s;ame time, they thought them&s;elves bound in duty to give their opinion, that they were not warranted by law to &s;it and act as a parliament. He then read a paper to the following effect: That fora&s;much as, by the fundamental laws and con&s;titution of this kingdom, all parliaments do di&s;&s;olve on the death of the &s;overeign, except in &s;o far as innovated by an act in the preceding reign, that the parliament in being at his decea&s;e &s;hould meet, and act what might be needful for the defence of the true prote&s;tant religion as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; and for the maintenance of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, as &s;ettled by the claim of right; and for the pre&s;ervation and security of the public peace. And &s;eeing the&s;e ends are fully an&s;wered by her maje&s;ty's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne, we conceive our&s;elves not now warranted by law to meet, &s;it, or act; and therefore do di&s;&s;ent from any thing that &s;hall be done or acted. The duke having re|cited this paper, and formally prote&s;ted again&s;t the proceedings of the parlia|ment, withdrew with &s;eventy nine members, amid&s;t the acclamations of the people.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding their &s;ece&s;&s;ion, the commi&s;&s;ioner, who retained a much greater number, produced the queen's letter, &s;ignifying her re&s;olution to maintain and protect her &s;ubjects in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their religion, laws, liberties, and the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline. She informed them of her having de|clared war again&s;t France: &s;he exhorted them to provide competent &s;upplies for maintaining &s;uch a number of forces as might be nece&s;&s;ary for di&s;appointing the enemy's de&s;igns, and pre&s;erving the pre&s;ent happy &s;ettlement; and &s;he earne&s;tly recommended to their con&s;ideration an union of the two kingdoms. The duke of Queen&s;berry and the earl of Marchmont having eforced the different ar|ticles of this letter, committees were appointed for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom,
<PB N="243" REF="2460">
for controverted elections, for drawing up an an&s;wer to her maje&s;ty's letter, and for revi&s;ing the minutes. Mean while, the duke of Hamilton and his ad|herents &s;ent the lord Blantyre to London with an addre&s;s to the queen, who refu&s;ed to receive it, and wrote another letter to the parliament, expre&s;&s;ing her re&s;olution to maintain their dignity and authority again&s;t all oppo&s;ers. They, in an&s;wer to the former, had a&s;&s;ured her, that the groundle&s;s &s;ece&s;&s;ion of &s;ome members &s;hould increa&s;e and &s;trengthen their care and zeal for her maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. They expelled Sir Alexander Bruce, for having given vent to &s;ome reflexions again&s;t pre&s;bytery. The lord advocate pro&s;ecuted the faculty of advocates before the parliament, for having pa&s;&s;ed a vote among them&s;elves in favour of the prote&s;tation and addre&s;s of the di&s;&s;enting members. The fa|culty was &s;everely reprimanded; but the whole nation &s;eemed to re&s;ent the pro&s;ecution. The parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act recognizing her maje&s;ty's royal au|thority: another for adjourning the court of judicature called the &s;e&s;&s;ion: a third declaring this meeting of parliament legal; and forbidding any per&s;on to di&s;own, quarrel, or impugn, the dignity and authority thereof, under the penalty of high trea&s;on: a fourth for &s;ecuring the true prote&s;tant religion and pre&s;byterian church-government: a fifth for a land-tax; and a &s;ixth enabling her maje&s;ty to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners for an union between the two king|doms.</P>

<P>The earl of Marchmont, of his own accord, and even contrary to the advice of the high-commi&s;&s;ioner, brought in a bill for abjuring the pretended prince of Wales: but this was not &s;upported by the court-party, as the com|mi&s;&s;ioner had no in&s;tructions how to act on the occa&s;ion. Perhaps the queen and her Engli&s;h mini&s;try re&s;olved to keep the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion open in Scotland, as a check upon the Whigs and hou&s;e of Hanover. On the thirtieth day of June, the commi&s;&s;ioner adjourned the parliament, after having thanked them for their chearfulne&s;s and unanimity in their proceedings; and the chie$$ of the op|po&s;ite parties ha&s;tened to London, to make their different repre&s;entations to the queen and her mini&s;try. In the mean time, &s;he appointed commi&s;&s;ioners for treating about the union; and they met at the Cockpit on the twenty-&s;econd day of October. On the twentieth day of the next month, they adju&s;ted the preliminaries, importing, That nothing agreed on among them&s;elves &s;hould be binding, except it be ratified by her maje&s;ty and the re&s;pective parliaments of both nations; and that, unle&s;s all the heads propo&s;ed for the treaty were agreed to, no particular thing agreed on &s;hould be binding. The queen vi|&s;ited them in December, in order to quicken their mutual endeavours. They agreed, that the two kingdoms &s;hould be in&s;eparably united into one monarchy, under her maje&s;ty, her heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and under the &s;ame limitations, according to the acts of &s;ettlement: but, when the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners pro|po&s;ed that the rights and privileges of their company trading to Africa and the Indies, &s;hould be pre&s;erved and maintained, &s;uch a difficulty aro&s;e as could not be &s;urmounted; and no further progre&s;s was made in this commi&s;&s;ion. The tranquillity of Ireland was not interrupted by any new commotion. That kingdom was ruled by ju&s;tices whom the earl of Roche&s;ter had appointed; and the tru&s;tees for the forfeited e&s;tates maintained their authority.</P>

<P>While Britain was engaged in the&s;e civil tran&s;actions, her allies were not idle on the continent. The old duke of Zell, and his nephew the elector of Br$$&s;wick, &s;urpri&s;ed the dukes of Wolfembuttle and Saxe-Gotha, whom they compelled to renounce their attachments to France, and concur in the com|mon councils of the empire. Thus the north of Germany was re-united in the intere&s;t of the confederates; and the princes would have been in a condition to a&s;&s;i&s;t them effectually, had not the neighbourhood of the war in Poland de|terred them from parting with their forces. England and the &s;tates-general endeavoured in vain to mediate a peace between the kings of Sweden and Po|land. Charles was become enamoured of war, and ambitious of conque&s;t. He threatened to invade Saxony through the dominions of Pru&s;&s;ia. Augu&s;tus retired to Cracow, while Charles penetrated to War&s;aw, and even ordered the cardinal-primate to &s;ummon a diet for chu&s;ing a new king. The &s;ituation of affairs at this juncture was far from being favourable to the allies. The court of Vienna had tampered in vain with the elector of Bavaria, who made u&s;e of this negotiation to rai&s;e his terms with Lewis. His brother the elector of Co|log$e, admitted French garri&s;ons into Liege, and all his places on the Rhine. The elector of Saxony was too hard pre&s;&s;ed by the king of Sweden, to &s;pare his full proportion of troops to the allies: the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was overawed by the vicinity of the Swedi&s;h conqueror: the duke of Savoy had joined his forces to tho&s;e of France, and over-run the whole &s;tate of Milan: and the pope, though he profe&s;&s;ed a neutrality, evinced him&s;elf &s;trongly bia$$ed to the French intere&s;ts.</P>

The French garri&s;on made a de&s;perate defence. They wor&s;ted the be&s;iegers in divers &s;allies, and maintained the place until it was reduced to a heap of a&s;hes. At length the allies made a general attack upon the counter|&s;carp and ravelin, which they carried after a very ob&s;tinate engagement, with the lo&s;s of two thou&s;and men. Then the garri&s;on capitulated on honourable terms, and the fortifications were razed. During this &s;iege, which la&s;ted from the eighteenth day of April to the middle of June, count Tallard po&s;ted him|&s;elf on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Rhine, from whence he &s;upplied the town with fre&s;h troops and ammunition, and annoyed the be&s;iegers with his artillery; but finding it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave the place, he joined the grand army, commanded by the duke of Burgundy in the Netherlands. The &s;iege of Kei&s;er&s;waert was covered by a body of Dutch troops under the earl of Athlone, who lay en|camped in the dutchy of Cleve. Mean while general Coehorn, at the head of another detachment entered Flanders, demoli&s;hed the French lines between the forts of Donat and I&s;abella, and laid the chatellanie of Bruges under contribu|tion: but a con&s;iderable body of French troops advancing under the marquis de Bedmar, and the count de la Motte, he overflowed the country, and retired under the walls of Sluys. The duke of Burgundy, who had taken the com|mand of the French army under Boufflers, encamped at Zanten, near Cleve, and laid a &s;cheme for &s;urpri&s;ing Nimeguen; in which, however, he was baffled
<PB N="245" REF="2480">
by the vigilance and activity of Athlone, who gue&s;&s;ing his de&s;ign, marched thither and encamped under the cannon of the town. In the beginning of June$ Landau was inve&s;ted by prince Lewis of Baden: in july the king of the Romans arrived in the camp of the be&s;iegers, with &s;uch pomp and magnificence as exhau&s;ted his father's trea&s;ury. On the ninth day of September the ci$adel was taken by a&s;&s;ault, and then the town &s;urrendered.</P>

<P>When the earl of Marlborough arrived in Holland, the earl of Ath|lone, in quality of veldt-marechal, in&s;i&s;ted upon an equal command with the Engli&s;h general; but the &s;tates obliged him to yield this point in favour of Marlborough, whom they declared generali&s;&s;imo of all their forces. In the beginning of July he repaired to the camp at Nimeguen, where he &s;oon a&s;|&s;embled an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, well provided with all nece&s;&s;aries; and then he convoked a council of the general officers, to concert the operations of the campaign. On the &s;ixteenth day of the month he pa&s;&s;ed the Ma$$e, and encamped at Over$a&s;&s;elt, within two leagues and a half of the enemy, who had intrenched them&s;elves between Goch and Gennep. He afterwards repa&s;&s;ed the river below the Grave, and removed to Gravenbroeck, where he was joined by the Briti&s;h train of artillery from Holland. On the &s;econd day of Augu&s;t, he advanced to Petit Brugel, and the French retired before him, leaving Spani&s;h Guelderland to his di&s;cretion. He had re&s;olved to hazard an engagement, and i&s;&s;ued orders accordingly; but he was re&s;trained by the Dutch deputies, who were afraid of their own intere&s;t, in ca&s;e the battle &s;hould have proved unfortunate. The duke of Burgundy finding him&s;elf obliged to retreat before the allied army, rather than expo&s;e him&s;elf longer to &s;uch a mortifying indignity, returned to Ver&s;ailles, leaving the command to Boufflers, who lo&s;t the confidence of Lewis by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of this campaign. The deputies of the &s;tates-general having repre&s;ented to the earl of Marlborough the advantages that would accrue to Holland, from his di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the enemy of the places they maintained in the Spani&s;h Guelderland, by which the navigation of the Mae&s;e was ob&s;tructed, and the important town of Mae&s;tricht in a manner blocked up, he re&s;olved to deliver them from &s;uch a trouble&s;ome neighbour|hood. He detached general Schultz with a body of troops to reduce the town and ca&s;tle of Werk, which were &s;urrendered after a &s;light re&s;i&s;tance, In the beginning of September, he undertook the &s;iege of Venlo, which capitulated on the twenty-fifth day of the month, after fort St. Michael had been &s;tormed and taken by lord Cutts and the Engli&s;h volunteers, among whom the young earl of Huntington di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by very extraordinary acts of valour. Then the general inve&s;ted Ruremonde, which he reduced after a very ob&s;tinate defence, together with the fort of Steven&s;uaert, &s;ituated on the &s;ame river. Boufflers, confounded at the rapidity of Marlborough's &s;ucce&s;s, retired towards Liege, in order to cover that city$ but, at the approach of the confederates, he retired with precipitation to Tongeren, from whence he directed his route towards Brabant, with a view to detend &s;uch places as the allies had no de&s;ign to attack. When the earl of Marlborough arrived at Liege, he found the &s;uburbs of St. Walburgh had been &s;et on fire by the French garri&s;on, who had retired into the citadel and the Chartreux. The allies took immediate po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city; and in a few days opened the trenches again&s;t the citadel,
<PB N="246" REF="2490">
which was taken by a&s;&s;$ult. On this $cc$&s;ion, the $ereditary prince of He$$e-Ca$$$$ charged at the head of the $word$ and was the first per&s;on who mounted the breach. Violani the governor, and the duke of Ch$$o&s;t, were made pri&s;oners. Three hundred thou&s;and $$$rins i$ gold and &s;ilver were found in the citadel, be&s;ides notes for above one million, drawn upon &s;ub&s;tantial merchants in Liege, who pay$d the money. Immediately after this exploit, the g$rri&s;on of the Chartreux capitulated on honourable terms, and were con|ducted to Antwerp. By the &s;ucce&s;s of this campaign, the earl of Marlborough rai&s;ed his military character above all cen&s;ure, and confirmed him&s;elf i$ the intire confidence of the &s;tates-general, who, in the beginning of the $$$$on, had trembled for Nimeguen, and now &s;aw the enemy driven back into their own domains.</P>

<P>When the army broke up in November, the general repaired to Ma$$$ric$t, from whence he propo&s;ed to return to the Hague by water. Ac|cordingly he embarked in a large boat, with five and twenty &s;oldiers, under the command of a lieutenant. Ne$t morning he was joined at Ruremonde by Co$h$$n, in a larger ve&s;&s;el, with &s;ixty men; and they were $or$over e&s;corted by fifty troopers that rode along-&s;ide of the river. The large boat out&s;ailed the other, and the hor&s;emen mi&s;took their way in the dark. A French partizan, with five and thirty men from Gueldres, who lurked among the ru&s;hes in wait for prey, &s;eized the rope by which the bo$t was drawn, hauled it a&s;hore, di&s;charged their &s;mall arms and hand-grenades, then ru&s;hing into it, &s;e|cured the &s;oldiers before they could put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence. The earl of Marlborough was accomp$nied by general Opdam, and Mynheer Gueldermal&s;en, one of the deputies, who were provided with p$$$ports. The earl had neglected this precaution; but recollecting he had an old pa&s;&s;port for his brother general Churchill, he produced it without any emotion; and the partizan was in &s;uch confu&s;ion that he never examined the date. Neverthele&s;s, he ri$$ed their baggage, carried off the guard as pri&s;oners, and allowed the boat to proceed. The governor of Venlo receiving information that the earl was &s;urpri&s;ed by a party and conveyed to Gueldres, immediately marched out with his whole garri&s;on to inve&s;t that place. The &s;ame imperfect account being tran&s;mitted to Holland, filled the whole province with con&s;ternation. The &s;tates forthwith a&s;&s;embling, re&s;olved that all their forces &s;hould march immediately to Gueldres, and threaten the garri&s;on of the place with the ut|mo&s;t extremities, unle&s;s they would immediately deliver the general. But, before the&s;e orders could be di&s;patched, the earl arrived at the Hague, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the people, who already looked upon him as their &s;aviour and protector.</P>

<P>The French arms were not quite &s;o unfortunate on the Rhine as in Flanders. The elector of Bavaria &s;urpri&s;ed the city of Ulm in Suabia, by a &s;tratagem, and then declared for France, which had by this time complied with all his demands. The diet of the empire a&s;&s;embled at Rati&s;bon were &s;o incen&s;ed at his conduct in &s;eizing the city of Ulm by per$$dy, that they pre|&s;ented a memorial to his Imperial maje&s;ty, reque&s;ting he would proceed again&s;t the elector, according to the con&s;titutions of the empire. They re&s;olved, by a plurality of voices, to declare war in the name of the empire, again&s;t the
<PB N="247" REF="2500">
French king and the duke of $njo$, for having invaded &s;everal $word$ of the empire in Italy, the archbi&s;hopric of Cologne, and the dioce&s;e of Liege: and they forbad the mini&s;ters of $$varia and Cologne to appear in the general diet. In vain did the&s;$ powers prote&s;t again&s;t their proceedings. The empire's de|claration of war was publi&s;hed and notified, in the name of the diet, to the cardinal of Limberg, the emperor's commi&s;&s;ioner. Mean while, the French made them&s;elves ma$$ers o$ Newburgh, in the circle of Suabia; and Lewis prince of $$den being weakened by &s;ending off detachments, was obliged to lie inactive in his camp near Fri$$$ng$en. The French army was divided into two bodies, commanded by the marquis de Villars and the count de Gu$&s;card; and the prince thinking him&s;elf in danger of being enclo&s;ed by the enemy, re|&s;olved to decamp. Villars immediately pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, to fall upon him in his retreat; and an o$$$in$te enga$$m$nt en&s;uing, the Imperi$$i$$$ were o$er|powered by numbers. The prince having lo&s;t two thou&s;and men, abandoned the field of battle to the enemy, together with his baggage, artillery, and am|munition, and retired towards S$a$$$en, without being pur&s;ued; for the French army, even after they had gained the battle, were unaccountably &s;eized with &s;uch a panic, that if the Imperial general had $$ced them with two regi|ments, he would have &s;$$tc$ed the victory from Villars, who was upon this occa&s;ion &s;aluted marechal of France by the &s;oldiers; and next day the town of Fridlinguen &s;urrendered. The prince being joined by &s;ome troops under ge|neral Thungen, and other reinforcements, re&s;olved to give battle to the ene|my: but Vill$$s declined an engagement, and repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine. Towards the latter end of October, count Tallard, and the ma$quis de Lomarie, with a body of eighteen thou&s;and men, reduced Triers and $raerbach; while the prince of He$$e-Ca&s;&s;el, with a detachment from the allied army at Liege, re|took from the French the towns of Zinch, Lintz, Bri$ac, and A$dernach.</P>

<P>In Italy, prince Eugene laboured under a total neglect of the Im|perial court, where his enemies, on pretence of &s;upporting the king of the Romans in his fir&s;t campaign, weaned the emperor's attention intirely from his affairs in Italy; &s;o that he left his be&s;$ army to mo$lder away for want of recruits and reinforcements. The prince thus abandoned, could not prevent the duke of Vendome from relieving Mantua, and was obliged to relinqui&s;h &s;ome other places he had taken. Philip king of Spain being in&s;pired with the ambition of putting an end to the war in this country, failed in per&s;on for Naples, where he was vi&s;ited by the cardinal l$g$te, with a compliment from the pope; yet he could not obtain the inve&s;titure of the kingdom from his holine&s;s The emperor, however, was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted at the emba&s;&s;y which the pope had &s;ent to Philip, that he ordered his amba&s;&s;ador at Rome to withdraw. Philip proceeded from Naples to Final, under convoy of the French $$eet which had brought him to Italy$ he had an interview with the duke of Savoy, who began to be alarmed at the pro&s;pect of the French king's being ma&s;ter of the Milane&s;e; and, in a letter to the duke of Vendome, he forbade him to engage prince Eugene until he him&s;elf &s;hould arrive in the camp. Prince Eugene under&s;tanding that the French army intended to attack Luzzara and Gua$$alla, pa&s;&s;ed the Po, with an army of about half the number of the enemy, and po&s;ted him|&s;elf behind the dyke of Zero, in &s;uch a manner that the French were ignorant
<PB N="248" REF="2510">
of his &s;ituation. He concluded, that on their arrival at the ground they had cho&s;en, the hor&s;e would march out to forage, while the re&s;t of the army would be employed in pitching tents, and providing for their re|fre&s;hment. His de&s;ign was to &s;eize that opportunity of attacking them, not doubting that he &s;hould obtain a complete victory: but he was di&s;appointed by mere accident. An adjutant, with an advanced guard, had the curio&s;ity to a&s;cend the dyke, in order to view the country, when he di&s;covered the Imperial infantry lying on their faces, and their hor&s;e in the rear, ranged in order of battle. The French camp was immediately alarmed; and, as the intermediate ground was covered with hedges, which obliged the a&s;&s;ailants to defile, the enemy were in a po&s;ture of defence before the Imperiali&s;ts could ad|vance to action: neverthele&s;s, the prince attacked them with great vivacity, in hope of di&s;ordering their line, which gave way in &s;everal places; but night interpo&s;ing, he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t; and, in a few days, the French reduced Luzzara and Gua&s;talia. The prince, however, maintained his po&s;ts, and Philip returned to Spain, without having obtained any con&s;iderable advantage.</P>

<P>The French king employed all his artifice and intrigues in rai&s;ing up new enemies again&s;t the confederates. He is &s;aid to have bribed count Mansfield, pre&s;ident of the council of war at Vienna, to withold the &s;upplies from prince Eugene in Italy. At the Ottoman Porte he had actually gained over the vizir, who engaged to renew the war with the emperor. But the Mufti and all the other great officers were aver&s;e to this de&s;ign, and the vizir fell a &s;acrifice to their re&s;entment. Lewis continued to embroil the kingdom of Poland by means of the cardinal primate. The young king of Sweden advanced to Li&s;&s;aw, where he defeated Augu&s;tus. Then he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cracow, and rai&s;ed contributions; nor could he be per&s;uaded to retreat, although the Mu&s;covites and Lithuanians had ravaged Livonia, and even made an irruption into Sweden.</P>

<P>The operations of the combined &s;quadrons at &s;ea did not fully an&s;wer the expectations of the public. On the twelfth day of May, Sir John Munden put to &s;ea with twelve &s;ail of &s;hips, to intercept a French &s;quadron ap|pointed as a convoy to a new viceroy of Mexico, from Corunna to the We&s;t Indies. On the twenty-eighth day of the month, he cha&s;ed fourteen &s;ail of French &s;hips into Corunna. Then he called a council of war, in which it was agreed, that as the place was &s;trongly fortified, and by the intelligence they had received, it appeared that &s;eventeen of the enemy's &s;hips of war rode at anchor in the harbour, it would be expedient for them to follow the latter part of their in&s;tructions, by which they were directed to crui&s;e in &s;oundings for the protection of the trade. They returned accordingly, and being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by want of provi&s;ions, came into port, to the general di&s;content of the nation. For the &s;atisfaction of the people, Sir John Munden was tried by a court-martial, and acquitted; but as this mi&s;carriage had rendered him very unpopular, prince George di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from the &s;ervice. We have already hinted, that king William had projected a &s;cheme to reduce Cadiz, with intention to act after|wards again&s;t the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in the We&s;t-Indies. This de&s;ign queen Anne re&s;olved to put in execution. Sir George Rooke commanded the fleet, and the duke of Ormond was appointed general of the land-forces de&s;tined for
<PB N="249" REF="2520">
this expedition. The combined &s;quadrons amounted to fifty &s;hips of the line, exclu&s;ive of frigates, fire&s;hips, and &s;maller ve&s;&s;els; and, the number of &s;oldiers embarked was not far &s;hort of fourteen thou&s;and. In the latter end of June the fleet &s;ailed from St. Helen's; and, on the twelfth of Augu&s;t they anchored at the di&s;tance of two leagues from Cadiz. Next day, the duke of Ormond &s;ummoned the duke de Brancaccio, who was governor, to &s;ubmit to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; but, that officer an&s;wered, he would acquit him&s;elf honourably of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by the king. On the fifteenth the duke of Ormond landed with his forces in the bay of Bulls, under cover of a &s;mart fire from &s;ome frigates, and repul&s;ed a body of Spani&s;h cavalry: then he &s;ummoned the go|vernor of fort St. Catherine's to &s;urrender; and received an an&s;wer, import|ing, that the garri&s;on was prepared for his reception. A declaration was pub|li&s;hed in the Spani&s;h language, intimating, that the allies did not come as ene|mies to Spain; but, only to free them from the yoke of France, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves under the government of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The&s;e profe&s;&s;ions produced very little effect among the Spaniards, who were either cooled in their attachment to that family, or provoked by the exce&s;&s;es of the Engli&s;h troops, which having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fort St. Catherine, and Port St. Mary's, in&s;tead of protecting, plundered the natives, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trict orders i&s;&s;ued by the duke of Ormond, to prevent this &s;candalous practice: even &s;ome general-officers were concerned in the pillage. A battery was rai&s;ed again&s;t Montagorda-fort oppo&s;ite to the Puntal; but, the attempt mi&s;carried, and the troops were reimbarked.</P>

<P>Captain Hardy having been &s;ent to water in Lagos-bay, received intelligence, that the galleons from the We&s;t-Indies had put into Vigo, under convoy of a French &s;quadron. He &s;ailed immediately in que&s;t of Sir George Rooke, who was now in his voyage back to England, and falling in with him on the &s;ixth day of October, communicated the &s;ub&s;tance of what he had learned. Rooke immediately called a council of war, in which it was deter|mined, to alter their cour&s;e and attack the enemy at Vigo. He forthwith de|tached &s;ome &s;mall ve&s;&s;els for intelligence, and received a confirmation, that the galleons and the &s;quadron commanded by Chateau Renault, were actually in the harbour. They &s;ailed thither, and appeared before the place on the eleventh day of October. The pa&s;&s;age into the harbour was narrow, &s;ecured by batte|ries, forts, and brea&s;t works on each &s;ide; by a &s;trong boom, con&s;i&s;ting of iron|chains, topma&s;ts, and cables, moored at each end to a &s;eventy-gun &s;hip, and fortified within by five &s;hips of the &s;ame &s;trength, lying athwart the channel, with their broad-&s;ides to the offing. As the fir&s;t and &s;econd rates of the com|bined fleets were too large to enter, the admirals &s;hifted their flags into &s;maller &s;hips; and a divi&s;ion of five and twenty Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;hips of the line, with their frigates, fire&s;hips, and ketches, was de&s;tined for the &s;ervice. In order to facilitate the attack, the duke of Ormond landed with five and twenty hundred men, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles from Vigo, and took by a&s;&s;ault a fort and plat|form of forty pieces of cannon, at the entrance of the harbour. The Briti&s;h en&s;ign was no &s;ooner &s;$en flying at the top of this fort, than the &s;hips advanced to the attack. Vice-admiral Hop&s;on, in the Torbay, crowding all his &s;ail, ran directly again&s;t the boom, which was broken by the fir&s;t &s;hock; then the whole &s;quad$on entered the harbour, through a prodigious fire from the enemy's &s;hips
<PB N="250" REF="2530">
and batteries. The&s;e la&s;t$ however, were &s;oon &s;to$med and taken by the gre|nadiers who had been landed. The great &s;hips lay again&s;t the forts as each &s;ide of the harbour, which in a little time they &s;ilenced; though vice-admiral Hop|&s;on narrowly e&s;caped from a fire&s;hip by which he was boarded. After a very vigorous engagement, the French finding them&s;elves unable to cope with &s;uch an adver&s;ary, re&s;olved to de&s;tory their &s;hips and galleons, that they might not fall into the hands of the victors. They accordingly burned and ran a&s;hore eight &s;hips and as many advice-boats; but, ten &s;hips of war were taken, toge|ther with eleven galleons. Though they had &s;ecured the be&s;t part of their plate and merchandize before the Engli&s;h fleet arrived, the value of fourteen million of pieces of eight, in plate and rich commodities, was de&s;troyed in &s;ix galleons that peri&s;hed; but, about half that value was brought off by the con|querors: &s;o that this was a dreadful blow to the enemy, and a noble acqui&s;ition to the allies. Immediately after this exploit Sir George Rooke was joined by Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel, who had been &s;ent out with a &s;quadron to intercept the galleons. This officer was left to bring home the prizes and di&s;mantle the for|tif$cations, while Rooke returned in triumph to England.</P>

<P>The glory which the Engli&s;h acquired in this expedition was in &s;ome mea&s;ure tarni&s;hed by the conduct of &s;ome officers in the We&s;t-Indies. Thither admiral Benbow had been detached with a &s;quadron of ten &s;ail, in the cour&s;e of the preceding year. At Jamaica he received intelligence, that mon&s;ieur Du Caffe was in the neighbourhood of Hi&s;paniola, and re&s;olved to beat up to that i&s;land. At Leogane he fell in with a French &s;hip of fifty guns, which her cap|tain ran a&s;hore and blew up. He took &s;everal other ve&s;&s;els, and having alarmed Petit-Guavas, bore away for Donna Maria bay, where he under&s;tood, that Du Caffe had &s;ailed for the coa&s;t of Carthagene. Benbow re&s;olved to follow the &s;ame cour&s;e; and on the nineteenth of Augu&s;t di&s;covered the enemy's &s;quadron near St. Martha, con&s;i&s;ting of ten &s;ail &s;teering along &s;hore. He formed the line; and an engagement en&s;ued, in which he was very ill &s;econded by &s;ome of his captains. Neverthele&s;s, the battle continued till night, and he determined to renew it next morning, when he perceived all his &s;hips at the di&s;tance of three of four miles a&s;tern, except the Ruby, commanded by captain George Walton, who joined him in plying the enemy with chace-guns. On the twenty|fir&s;t the&s;e two &s;hips engaged the French &s;quadron; and, the Ruby was &s;o di&s;|abled, that the admiral was obliged to &s;end her back to Jamaica. Next day the Greenwich, commanded by Wade, was five leagues a&s;tern; and the wind changing, the enemy had the advantage of the weather-gage. On the twenty-third the admiral renewed the battle with his &s;ingle &s;hip, un&s;u&s;tained by the re&s;t of the &s;quadron. On the twenty-fourth his leg was &s;hattered by a chain-&s;hot; notwith&s;tanding which accident, he remained on the quarter-deck in a cradle, and continued the engagement. One of the large&s;t &s;hips of the enemy lying like a wreck upon the water, four &s;ail of the Engli&s;h &s;quadron poured their broad&s;ides into her, and then ran to leeward, without paying any regard to the &s;ignal for battle. Then the French bearing down upon the admiral with their whole force, &s;hot away his m$intop&s;ail-yard, and damaged his rigging in &s;uch a manner, that he was obliged to lie by and re&s;it, while they took their di&s;abled &s;hip in tow. During this interval, he called a council of his capt$$ns, and ex|po&s;tulated with them on their behaviour. They ob&s;erved, that the French
<PB N="251" REF="2540">
were very &s;trong, and advi&s;ed him to de&s;i&s;t. He plainly perceived that he w$s betrayed, and with the utmo&s;t reluctance returned to Jamaica, having not only lo&s;t a leg, but al&s;o received a large wound in his face, and another in his arm, while he in per&s;on boarded the French admiral. Exa&s;perated at the treachery of his captains, he granted a commi&s;&s;ion to rear admiral Whet&s;tone and other officers to hold a court-martial, and try them for cowardice. Hud&s;on of the Pendennis died before his trial: Kirby and Wade were convicted and &s;entenced to be &s;hot: Con&s;table of the Wind&s;or was ca&s;hiered and impri&s;oned: Vincent of the Falmouth, and Fogg the admiral's own captain of the Breda, were con|victed of having &s;igned a paper, that they would not fight under Benbow's command; but, as they behaved gallantly in the action, the court inflicted upon them no other puni&s;hment than that of a provi&s;ional &s;u&s;pen&s;ion.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the queen &s;eemed to be happy in the affec|tion of her &s;ubjects. Though the continuance of the parliament was limited to &s;ix months after the king's decea&s;e, &s;he di&s;&s;olved it by proclamation before that term was expired; and, i&s;&s;ued writs for electing another, in which the Tory intere&s;t predominated. In the &s;ummer the queen gave audience to the count de Platens, envoy extraordinary from the elector of Hanover; then &s;he made a progre&s;s with her hu&s;band to Oxford, Bath, and Bri&s;tol, where &s;he was received with all the marks of the mo&s;t genuine affection. The new parliament meeting on the twentieth day of October, Mr. Harley was cho&s;en &s;peaker. The queen in her &s;peech declared, &s;he had &s;ummoned them to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in car|rying on the ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary war in which the nation was engaged. She de|&s;ired the commons would in&s;pect the accounts of the public receipts and pay|ments, that if any abu&s;es had crept into the management of the finances, they might be detected, and the offenders puni&s;hed. She told them, that the funds a&s;&s;igned in the la&s;t parliament had not produced the &s;ums granted; and, that the deficiency was not &s;upplied even by the hundred thou&s;and pounds which &s;he had payed from her own revenue for the public &s;ervice. She expre&s;&s;ed her concern for the di&s;appointment at Cadiz, as well as for the abu&s;es committed at port St.

Mary's, which had obliged her to give directions for the &s;tricte&s;t examination of the particulars. She hoped they would find time to con&s;ider of &s;ome better and more effectual method to prevent the exportation of wool, and improve that manufacture, which &s;he was determined to encourage. She profe&s;&s;ed a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that the affection of her &s;ubjects was the &s;ure&s;t pledge of their duty and obedience. She promi&s;ed to defend and maintain the church as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, protect her &s;ubjects in the full enjoyments of all their rights and liberties. She prote&s;ted, that &s;he relied on their care of her: &s;he &s;aid her intere&s;t and theirs were in&s;eparable; and, that her endeavours &s;hould never be wanting to make them all &s;afe and happy. She was pre&s;ented with a very af|f$ctionate addre&s;s from either hou&s;e, congratulating her upon the glorious &s;uc|ce&s;s of her arms, and tho&s;e of her allies, under the command of the earl of Marlborough; but, that of the commons was di&s;tingui&s;hed by an implicated reproach on the late reign, importing, that the wonderful progre&s;s of her ma|je&s;ty's arms under the earl of Marlborough, had &s;ignally "retrieved" the antient honour and glory of the Engli&s;h nation. This expre&s;&s;ion had excited a warm debate in the hou&s;e, in the cour&s;e of which many &s;evere reflections were made on the memory of king William. At length, the que&s;tion was put, Whether the word "Retrieved" &s;hould remain? and, carried in the affirmative by a ma|jority of one hundred.</P>

<P>The &s;trength of the Tories appeared in nothing more con&s;picuous than in their inquiry concerning controverted elections. The borough of Hin|don near Sali&s;bury was convicted of bribery, and a bill brought in for di&s;|franchi&s;ing the town; yet, no vote pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the per&s;on who exerci&s;ed this corruption, becau&s;e he happened to be a Tory. Mr. Howe was declared duly elected for Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, tho' the majority of the electors had voted for the other candidate. Sir John Packington having exhibited a complaint again&s;t the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter and his &s;on, for having endeavoured to prevent his election; the commons having taken it into con&s;ideration, re&s;olved, that the proceedings of William, lord bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, and his &s;on, had been ma|licious, unchri&s;tian, and arbitrary, in high violation of the liberties and privi|leges of the commons of England. They voted an addre&s;s to the queen, de&s;iring her to remove the father from the office of lord-almoner; and, they ordered the attorney-general to pro&s;ecute the &s;on, after his privilege as member of the convocation &s;hould be expired. A counter-addre&s;s was immedi|ately voted, and pre&s;ented by the lords, be&s;eeching her maje&s;ty would not remove the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter from the place of lord-almoner, until he &s;hould be $ound guilty of &s;ome crime by due cour&s;e of law; as it was the undoubted right of every lord of parliament, and of every &s;ubject of England, to have an opportunity to make his defence before he &s;uffers any &s;ort of puni&s;hment. The queen &s;aid, &s;he had not as yet received any complaint again&s;t the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter; but, &s;he looked upon it as her undoubted right to continue or di&s;|place any &s;ervant attending upon her own per&s;on, when &s;he &s;hould think proper. The peers having received this an&s;wer, unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, That no lord of their hou&s;e ought to &s;uffer any &s;ort of puni&s;hment by any proceedings of the hou&s;e of commons, otherwi&s;e than according to the known and antient rules and methods of parliament. When the commons attended the queen with their addre&s;s again&s;t the bi&s;hop, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he was &s;orry there was occa&s;ion for &s;uch a

remon&s;trance; and, that the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter &s;hould no longer continue to &s;upply the place of her almoner. This regard to their addre&s;s was a flagrant proof of her partiality to the Tories, who &s;eemed to ju&s;tify her attachment by their compliance and liberality.</P>

<P>In deliberating on the &s;upplies, they agreed to all the demands of the mini&s;try. They voted forty thou&s;and &s;eamen, and the like number of land|forces, to act in conjunction with tho&s;e of the allies. For the maintenance of the&s;e la&s;t, they granted eight hundred and thirty-three thou&s;and eight hundred and twenty-&s;ix pounds; be&s;ides three hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds for guards and garri&s;ons; &s;eventy thou&s;and nine hundred and &s;eventy-three pounds for ord|nance; and fifty-one thou&s;and eight hundred and forty-three pounds for &s;ub&s;ides to the allies. The lord Shannon arriving with the news of the &s;ucce&s;s at Vigo$ the queen appointed a day of thank&s;giving for the &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s of her arms under the earl of Marlborough, the duke of Ormond, and Sir George Rooke; and, on that day, which was the twelfth of November, &s;he went in &s;tate to St. Paul's church, attended by both hou&s;es of parliament. Next day, the peers voted the thanks of their hou&s;e to the duke of Ormond for his &s;ervices at Vigo; and, at the &s;ame time, drew up an addre&s;s to the queen, de&s;iring &s;he would order the duke of Ormond and Sir George Rooke to lay before them an account of their proceedings: a reque&s;t with which her maje&s;ty complied. Tho&s;e two officers were likewi&s;e thanked by the hou&s;e of commons; and, vice-admiral Hop&s;on was knighted and gratified with a con&s;iderable pen&s;ion. The duke of Ormond, at his return from the expedition, complained openly of Rooke's conduct, and &s;eemed determined to &s;ubject him to a public accu&s;ation; but, that officer was &s;uch a favourite among the commons, that the court was afraid to di&s;oblige them by an impeachment, and took great pains to mitigate the duke's re&s;entment. This nobleman was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and Rooke was admitted into the privy-council. A motion, however, being made in the hou&s;e of lords, that the admiral's in&s;tructions and journals rel$ting to the la&s;t expedition might be examined, a committee was appointed for that purpo&s;e, and prepared an unfavourable report: but, it was rejected by a majo|rity of the hou&s;e; and, they voted, That Sir George Rooke had done his duty, pur&s;uant to the councils of war, like a brave officer, to the honour of the Briti&s;h nation.</P>

<P>On the twenty-fir&s;t day of November the queen &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e of commons by Mr. &s;ecretary Hedges, recommending further provi&s;ion for the prince her hu&s;band, in ca&s;e he &s;hould &s;urvive her. This me&s;&s;age being con&s;idered, Mr. Howe moved, That the yearly &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be &s;ettled on the prince, in ca&s;e he &s;hould &s;urvive her maje&s;ty. No oppo&s;ition was made to the propo&s;al; but, warm debates were excited by a clau&s;e in the bill, exempting the prince from that part of the act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by which &s;trangers, though naturalized, were rendered incapable of holding employments. This clau&s;e related only to tho&s;e who &s;hould be naturalized in a future reign; and indeed was calculated as a re&s;triction upon the hou&s;e of Hanover. Many members argued again&s;t this clau&s;e of exemption, becau&s;e it &s;eemed to imply, that per&s;ons already naturalized would be excluded from employments in the next reign, though already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the right of na|tural-born &s;ubjects, a con&s;equence plainly contradictory to the meaning of the

$ct. Others oppo&s;ed it, becau&s;e the lords had already re&s;olved by a vote, That they would never pa&s;s any bill &s;ent up from the commons, to which a clau&s;e foreign to the bill &s;hould be t$cked; and this clau&s;e they affirmed to be a tack, as an incapacity to hold employments was a circum&s;tance altogether di&s;tinct from a &s;ettlement in money. The queen expre&s;&s;ed uncommon eager|ne$$ in behalf of this bill; and the court-influence was managed &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that it pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, though not without an ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition, and a formal prote&s;t by &s;even and twenty peers.</P>

<P>The earl of Marlborough arriving in England about the latter end of Nov$mber, received the thanks of the commons for his great and &s;ignal $$$vices, which were &s;o ac$eptable to the queen, that &s;he created him a duke, g$$$ified him with a pen&s;ion of five thou&s;and pounds upon the revenue of the po$$-off$ce during his natural life; and, in a me&s;&s;age to the commons, expre&s;&s;ed a de$$$e, that they would find &s;ome method to &s;ettle it on the heirs-male of his body. This intimation was productive of warm debates, during which Sir C$$i$topher Mu&s;grave ob&s;erved, that he would not derogate from the duke's $$inent &s;ervices; but, he affirmed, his grace had been very well payed for them, by the profitable employments which he and his dutche&s;s enjoyed. The d$ke under&s;tanding that the commons were heated by the &s;ubject, begged her $$je&s;ty would rather forego her gracious me&s;&s;age in his behalf, than create any unea&s;ine&s;s on his account, which might embarra&s;s her affairs, and be of ill con|&s;equenc$ to the public. Then &s;he &s;ent another me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e, &s;ignifying, that the duke of Marlborough had declined her interpo&s;ition. Notwith&s;tand|ing this decla$ation, the commons in a body pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, acknowledg|ing the eminent &s;ervices of the duke of Marlborough, and expre&s;&s;ing their ap|prehen&s;ion of making a precedent to alienate the revenue of the crown, which had been &s;o much reduced by the exorbitant grants of the late reign, and &s;o l$$ely &s;ettled and &s;ecured by her maje&s;ty's unparalleled grace and goodne&s;s. The queen was &s;atisfied with their apology; but, their refu&s;al in all probability helped to alienate the duke from the Tories, with whom he had been hitherto connected.</P>

<P>In the beginning of January the queen gave the hou&s;e of commons $o under&s;tand, that the &s;tates$general had pre&s;&s;ed her to augment her forces, as the only means to render ineffectual the great and early preparations of the ene|my. The commons immediately re&s;olved, That ten thou&s;and men &s;hould be $i$ed, as an a$gmentation of the forces to act in conjunction with the allies; b$t, on condition, that an immediate &s;top &s;hould be put to all commerce and $$$$e&s;pondence with France and Spain on the part of the &s;tates-general. The lo$$$ pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the queen on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and to the &s;ame e$$ect; and, &s;he owned, that the condition was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the whole alliance. The Dutch, even after the declaration of war, had car|ried on a traffic with the French; and, at this very juncture, Lewis found it i$po&s;&s;ible to make remittances of money to the elector of Bavaria in Germany, and to his forces in Italy, except thro' the canal of Engli&s;h, Dutch, and Geneva $erchants. The &s;tates-general, though &s;hocked at the imperious manner in which the parliament of England pre&s;crib$d their conduct, complied with the demand without he&s;itation, and publi&s;hed a prohibition of all commerce with the &s;ubjects of France and Spain.</P>

<P>The commons of this parliament had nothing mor$ at heart tha$ a bill again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity. The Tories affected to di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves as the only true friends to the church and monarchy$ and they ha$ed the di&s;&s;enters with a mixture of &s;piritual and political di&s;gu&s;t. They look$d upon them as an intruding &s;ect, which con&s;tituted great part of the Whig faction that extorted &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums of money from the nation in the late reign, and involved it in pernicious engagements, from whence it had no pro&s;p$ct o$ deliverance. They con&s;idered them as incroaching &s;chi&s;matics that di&s;grac$$ and endangered the hierarchy; and, tho&s;e of their own communion who recom|mended moderation, they branded with the epithets of lukewarm chri&s;ti$n$, be|trayers, and apo&s;tates. They now re&s;olved to approve them&s;elves zealous &s;o$$ of the church, by &s;eizing the fir&s;t opportunity that was in their power to di&s;tre&s;s th$ di&s;&s;enters. In order to pave the way to this per&s;ecution, &s;ermons were pre$ch$d$ and pamphlets were printed to blacken the character of the &s;ect, and $word$ the popular re&s;entment again&s;t them. On the fourth day of November, Mr. Bromley, Mr. St. John, and Mr. Anne&s;ley, were ordered by the hou&s;e of co$|mons to bring in a bill for preventing occa&s;ional conformity. In the preamble all pre&s;ecution for con&s;cience &s;ake was condemned: neverthele&s;s, it enacted, That all tho&s;e who had taken the &s;acrament and te&s;t for offices of tru&s;t, or the magi&s;|tracy of corporations, and afterwards frequented any meeting of di&s;&s;$nt$rs, &s;hould be di&s;abled from holding their employments, pay a fine of one hundred pounds, and five pounds for every day in which they continued to act in their employments afte$ having been at any &s;uch meeting: they were al&s;o rendered incapable of holding any other employment, till after one whole year's conformity; and, upon a re|lap&s;e, the penalties and time of incapacity were doubled. The promoters of the bill alledged, that an e&s;tabli&s;hed religion and national church were ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, when &s;o many impious men pretended to in&s;piration, and deluded &s;uch numbers of the people: that the mo&s;t effectual way to pre&s;erve this national church, would be the maintenance of the civil power in the hand$ of tho&s;e who expre&s;&s;ed their regard to the church in their principles and practi$e$ that the parliament, by the corporation and te&s;t-acts, thought they had rai&s;ed a &s;ufficient barrier to the hierarchy, never imagining that a &s;et of men would ri&s;e up, who&s;e con&s;ciences would be too$$ender to obey the law$, but hardene$ enough to break them: that, as the la&s;t reign began with an act in favour of di&s;&s;enters, &s;o the commons were de&s;irous that in the beginning of her maje&s;ty'$ au&s;picious government, an act &s;hould pa&s;s in favour of the church of En$|land: that this bill did not intrench on the act of toleration, or deprive the di&s;|&s;enters of any privileges they enjoyed by law, or add any thing to the legal right$$ of the church of England: that occa&s;ional conformity was an eva&s;ion of the law, by which the di&s;&s;enters might in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the management of all corporations: that a &s;eparation from the church, to which a man's con|&s;cience will allow him occa&s;ionally to conform, is a mere &s;chi&s;m, which in it&s;elf was &s;inful, without the &s;uperaddition of a temporal law to make i$ an offence$ that the toleration was intended only for the ea&s;e of tender con&s;ciences, and not to give a licence for occa&s;ional conformity: that conforming and nonconform|ing were contradictions; for, nothing but a firm per&s;ua&s;ion that the terms of communion required are &s;inful and unlawful, could ju&s;tify the one; and, this plainly condemns the other. The members who oppo&s;ed the bill argued, That
<PB N="256" REF="2590">
the di&s;&s;enters were generally well affected to the pre&s;ent con&s;titution$ that to bring any real hard&s;hip upon them, or give ri$e to jealou&s;ies and fears at &s;uch a juncture, might be a$tended with dangerous con&s;equences: that the toleration had greetly contributed to the &s;ecurity and reputation of the church, and plainly proved, that liberty of con&s;cience and gentle mea&s;ures were the mo&s;t effectual means for increa&s;ing the votaries of the church, and dimini&s;hing the number of di$$enters: that the di&s;&s;enters could not be termed &s;chi$$natics without bring|ing an heavy charge upon the church of England, which had not only tolerated &s;uch &s;chi$$$, but even allowed communion with the reformed churches abroad: that the penalties of this bill were more &s;evere than tho&s;e which the law impo&s;ed on papi&s;ts, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the mo&s;t &s;olemn act of their religion: in a word, that toleration and tenderne&s;s had been always productive of peace and union, whereas per&s;ecution had never $ailed to excite di&s;cord and extend &s;uper&s;tition. Many alterations and mitigations were propo&s;ed, without effect. In the cour&s;e of the debates the di&s;&s;enters were mentioned and reviled with great acrimony; and, the b$ll pu&s;&s;ed the lower hou&s;e by virtue of a con&s;iderable majority.</P>

<P>The lords apprehen&s;ive, that the commons would tack it to &s;ome money-bill, voted, That the annexing any clau&s;e to a money-bill was contrary to the con&s;titution of the Engli&s;h government, and the u&s;age of parliament. The bill met with a very warm oppo&s;ition in the upper hou&s;e, where a con|&s;iderable portion of the Whig intere&s;t &s;till remained. The&s;e members believed, that the intention of the bill was to model corporations, &s;o as to eject all tho&s;e who would not vote in elections for the Tories. Some imagined this was a preparatory &s;tep towards a repeal of the toleration; and, others concluded, that the promoters of the bill de&s;igned to rai&s;e &s;uch di&s;turbances at home, as would di&s;courage the allies abroad, and render the pro&s;ecution of the war impractica|ble. The majority of the bi&s;hops, and among the&s;e Burnet of Sarum, objected again&s;t it on the principles of moderation, and from motives of con&s;cience. Neverthele&s;s, as the court &s;upported this mea&s;ure with its whole power and influ|ence, the bill made its way through the hou&s;e, tho' not without alterations and amendments, which were rejected by the commons. The lower hou&s;e pre|sended, that the lords had no right to alter any fines and penalties that the commons &s;hould $ix in bills &s;ent up for their concurrence, on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that th$&s;e were matters concerning money, the peculiar province of the lower hou&s;e: the lords ordered a minute inquiry to be made into all the rolls of par|liament &s;ince the reign of the &s;eventh Henry; and, a great number of in&s;tances were $ound in which the lords had begun the clau&s;es impo&s;ing $ines $nd pe|nalties, altered the penalties which had been fixed by the commons, and even changed the u&s;es to which they were applied. The&s;e precede$es were entered in the books; but, the commons re&s;olved to maintain their point without en|gaging in any di&s;pute upon the &s;ubject. After warm debates and a free confe|nence between the two hou&s;es, the lords adhered to their amendments, though this re&s;olution was carried by a majority of one vote only: the commons per|&s;i&s;ted i$ rejecting them; the bill mi&s;carried; and, both hou&s;es publi&s;hed their proceedings by way of appeal to the nation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While this bill was depending, Daniel de Foe publi&s;hed a pamphlet, intit$led, <Q>&startq;The &s;hort|e&s;t way with the di&s;&s;enters or, propo&s;als for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church.&endq;</Q> The piece was a &s;evere &s;atire on the violence of the church|party. The commons ordered it to be burned by the hands of the common hangman, and the au|thor to be pro&s;ecuted. He was accordingly com|mitted to Newgate, tried, condemned to pay a fine of two hundred pounds, and &s;tand in the pil|lory.</NOTE>. A bill was now brought into

the lower hou&s;e, granting another year's con&s;ideration to tho&s;e who had not taken the oath abjuring the pretended prince of Wales. The lords added three clau&s;es, importing, That tho&s;e per&s;ons who &s;hould take the oath within the limited time, might return to their benefices and employments, unle&s;s they &s;hould be already legally filled: that any per&s;on endeavouring to defeat the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, as now limited by law, &s;hould be deemed guilty of high-trea&s;on: and, that the oath of abjuration &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon the &s;ub|jects in Ireland. The commons made &s;ome oppo&s;ition to the fir&s;t clau&s;e; but, at length, the que&s;tion being put, Whether they &s;hould agree to the amend|ments? it was carried in the affirmative by one voice.</P>

<P>No object engro&s;&s;ed more time, or produced more violent debates than did the inquiry into the public accounts. The commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for this purpo&s;e, pretended to have made great di&s;coveries. They changed the earl of Ranelagh, payma&s;ter-general of the army, with flagrant mi&s;management. He acquitted him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as &s;creened him from all &s;everity of pu|ni&s;hment; neverthele&s;s, they expelled him from the hou&s;e for a high crime and mi&s;deamenour, in mi&s;applying &s;everal &s;ums of the public money; and, he thought proper to re&s;ign his employment. A long addre&s;s was prepared and pre&s;ented to the queen, attributing the national debt to the mi&s;management of the funds; complaining, that the old methods of the exchequer had been ne|glected: and, that iniquitous frauds had been committed by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the prizes. Previous to this remon&s;trance, the hou&s;e, in con&s;equence of the report of the committee, had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;evere re&s;olutions, particularly, again&s;t Charles lord Hallifax, auditor of the receipt of the exchequer, as having neglected his duty, and been guilty of a breach of tru&s;t. For the&s;e rea|&s;ons, they actually be&s;ought the queen, in an addre&s;s, that &s;he would give direc|tions to the attorney-general, to pro&s;ecute him for the &s;aid offences; and &s;he promi&s;ed to comply with their reque&s;t. On the other hand, the lords appointed a committee to examine all the ob&s;ervations which the commi&s;&s;ioners of accounts had offered to both hou&s;es. They a&s;cribed the national debt to deficiencies in the funds: they acquitted lord Hallifax, the lords of the trea&s;ury, and their officers, whom the commons had accu&s;ed: and, repre&s;ented the&s;e circum&s;tances in an addre&s;s to the queen, which was afterwards printed with the vouchers to every particular. This difference blew up a fierce flame of di&s;cord between the two hou&s;es, which manife&s;ted their mutual animo&s;ity in &s;peeches, votes, re&s;olu|tions, and conferences. The commons affirmed, That no cognizance the lords could take of the public accounts, would enable them to &s;upply any deficiency, or appropriate any &s;urplu&s;age of the public money: that they could neither acquit or condemn any per&s;on wha&s;oever, upon any inquiry ari&s;ing originally in their own hou&s;e: and, that their attempt to acquit Charles lord Hallifax was unparlia|mentary. The lords in&s;i&s;ted upon their right to take cognizance originally of all public accounts: they affirmed, that in their re&s;olutions with re&s;pect to lord Hallifax, they had proceeded according to the rules of ju&s;tice. They owned, however, that their re&s;olutions did not amount to any judgment or acquittal;
<PB N="258" REF="2610">
but, that finding a vote of the commons reflected upon a member of their hou&s;e, they thought fit to give their opinion in their legi&s;lative authority. The queen interpo&s;ed by a me&s;&s;age to the lords, de&s;iring they would di&s;patch the bu|&s;ine&s;s in which they were engaged. The di&s;pute continued even after this inti|mation: one conference was held after another, till at length, both &s;ides de|&s;paired of an accommodation. The lords ordered their proceedings to be printed, and the commons followed their example. On the twenty-&s;eventh day of February the queen having pa&s;&s;ed all the bills that were ready for the royal a&s;&s;ent, ordered the lord-keeper to prorogue the parliament, after having pronounced a &s;peech, in which &s;he thanked them for their zeal, affection, and di&s;patch; declared, &s;he would encourage and maintain the church as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; de&s;ired, they would con&s;ider &s;ome further laws for re&s;training the great licence a&s;&s;umed of publi&s;hing &s;candalous pamphlets and libels; and a&s;&s;ured them, that all her &s;hare of the prizes which might be taken in the war, &s;hould be applied to the public &s;ervice. By this time the earl of Roche&s;ter was intirely removed from the queen's councils. Finding him&s;elf out-weighed by the intere&s;t of the duke of Marlborough and lord Godolphin, he had become &s;ullen and intractable; and, rather than repair to his government of Ireland, cho&s;e to re&s;ign the office, which, as we have already ob&s;erved, was conferred upon the duke of Ormond, an accompli&s;hed nobleman, who had acquired great popula|rity by the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition to Vigo. The parties in the hou&s;e of lords were &s;o nearly matched, that the queen, in order to a&s;certain an undoubted ma|j$$ity in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, created four new peers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were john Gra$ville, created b$ron Granville of Potheridge in the co$$ty of Devon; Heneage Finch, baron of Guern&s;ey in the county of Southamp$$$; Sir John Levi&s;on Gower$ baron Gower of S$ttenham in York&s;hire; and Francis Seymo$r Conway, younge&s;t &s;on of Sir Edward Seymour, made baron Conway of Ragley$ in the county of Warwick. At the &s;ame time, however, John Hervey of the oppo&s;ite faction, was created baron of I$kworth in the county of $span$ $and the marquis of Norm$nby was $span$ with the title of duke of Buckingham&s;hire.</NOTE>, who had &s;ignalized them|&s;elves by the violence of their &s;peeches in the hou&s;e of commo$s.</P>

<P>The two hou&s;es of convocation, which were &s;ummoned with the parliament, bore a &s;trong affinity with this a&s;&s;embly, by the different intere&s;ts that prevailed in the upper and lower. The la&s;t, in imitation of the commons, was de&s;$$ous of branding the preceding reign; and, it was with great difficulty that they concurred with the prelates in an addre&s;s of congratulation to her ma|je&s;ty. Then their former conte&s;t was revived. The lower hou&s;e de&s;ired, in an application to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and his &s;uffragans, that the matters in di&s;pute co$cerning the manner of &s;ynodical proceedings, and the right of the lower hou&s;e to hold intermediate a&s;&s;emblies, might be taken into con&s;ideration, and &s;peedily determined. The bi&s;hops propo&s;ed, that in the intervals of &s;e&s;&s;ions, the lower hou&s;e might appoint committees to prepare matters; and when bu&s;i|$e&s;s &s;hould be brought regularly before them, the archbi&s;hop$ would regulate the pro$ogations in &s;uch a manner, that they &s;hould have &s;ufficient time to &s;it and deliberate on the &s;ubject. This offer did not &s;atisfy the lower hou&s;e$ which was emboldened to per&s;i&s;t in its demand by a vote of the commons, who$ in con&s;equence of an addre&s;s of thanks from the clergy, touching Mr. Loyd, &s;on to the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, whom they had ordered to be pro&s;ecuted after his priv$$ege as member of the convocation &s;hould be expired, re&s;olved$ That they
<PB N="259" REF="2620">
would on all occa&s;ions a&s;&s;ert the ju&s;t rights and privileges of the lower hou&s;e of convocation. The prelates refu&s;ed $o d$part from the archbi&s;hop's right of proroguing the whole convocation with con&s;ent of his &s;uffragans. The lower hou&s;e propo&s;ed to refer the controver&s;y to the queen's deci&s;ion. The bi&s;hops declined this expedient, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the epi&s;copal authority, and the pre|&s;idency of the archbi&s;hop. The lower hou&s;e having incurred the imputation of favouring pre&s;bytery, by this oppo&s;ition to the bi&s;hops, entered in their books a declaration, acknowledging the order of bi&s;hops as &s;uperior to pre&s;byters, and to be a divine apo&s;tolical in&s;titution. Then they de&s;ired the bi&s;hops, in an addre&s;s, to concur in &s;ettling the doctrine of the divine apo&s;tolical right of epi&s;copacy, that it might be a &s;tanding rule of the church. They likewi&s;e pre&s;ented a petition to the queen, complaining, That in the convocation called in the year one thou|&s;and &s;even hundred, after an interruption of ten years, &s;everal que&s;tions having ari&s;en concerning the rights and liberties of the lower hou&s;e, the bi&s;hops had re|fu&s;ed a verbal conference; and, afterwards declined a propo&s;al to &s;ubmit the di&s;|pute to her maje&s;ty's determination: they therefore fled for protection to her maje&s;ty, begging &s;he would call the que&s;tion into her own royal audience. The queen promi&s;ed to con&s;ider their petition, which was &s;upported by the earl of Nottingham; and ordered their council to examine the affair, how it con&s;i&s;ted with law and cu&s;tom. Whether their report was unfavourable to the lower hou&s;e, or the queen was unwilling to encourage the divi&s;ion, no other an&s;wer was made to their addre&s;s. The archbi&s;hop replied to their reque&s;t pre&s;ented to the upper hou&s;e, concerning the divine right of pre&s;bytery, that the preface to the form of ordination contained a declaration of three orders of mini&s;ters from the times of the apo&s;tles; namely, bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts, and deacons, to which they had &s;ub&s;cribed: but, he and his brethren conceived, that without a royal licence, they had not authority to attempt, enact, promulge, or execute any canon, which &s;hould concern either doctrine or di&s;cipline. The lower hou&s;e an&s;wered this decl$ration in very petulant terms; and, the di&s;pute &s;ub&s;i&s;ted when the parliament was prorogued. But the&s;e conte&s;ts produced divi&s;ions thro' the whole body of the clergy, who ranged them&s;elves in different factions, di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the names of High-church and Low-church. The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tories; and, the other included tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed revolution principles, and recommended moderation towards the di&s;&s;enters. The high|church party reproached the other as time-&s;ervers, and pre&s;byterians in di&s;gui&s;e; and were in their turn &s;tigmatized as the friends and abettors of tyranny and perfecution. At pre&s;ent, however, the Tories both in church and &s;tate trium|phed in the favour of their &s;overeign. The right of parliaments, the memory of the late king, and even the act limiting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the hou&s;e of Hano|ver, became the &s;ubjects of ridicule. The queen was flattered as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;on of the prerogatives of the antient monarchy: the hi&s;tory written by her grand|father the earl of Clarendon was now for the fir&s;t time publi&s;hed, to inculcate the principles of obedience, and in&s;pire the people with an abhorrence of oppo|&s;ition to an anointed &s;overeign. Her maje&s;ty's hereditary right was deduced from Edward the confe&s;&s;or, and, as heir of his pretended fanctity and virtue, &s;he was per&s;uaded to touch per&s;ons afflicted with the king's evil, according to the office in&s;erted in the liturgy for this occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>The change of the mini&s;try in Scotland &s;eemed favourable to the epi&s;copalians and antire$olutioners of that kingdom. The earls of March|mo$t, Melvil, Selkirk, Leven, and Hynford, were layed a&s;ide: the earl of Sea|field was appointed chancellor; the duke of Queen&s;berry, and the lord vi&s;count Tarbat, were declared &s;ecretaries of &s;tate: the marquis of Annandale was made pre&s;ident of the council; and the earl of Tullibardin lord privy-&s;eal. A new parliament having been &s;ummoned, the earl of Seafield employed his in|f$$ence &s;o &s;$cce&s;sfully, that a great number of antirevolutioners was returned as members. The duke of Hamilton had obtained from the queen a letter to the privy-council in Scotland, in which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her de&s;ire, that the pre&s;|by$er$an clergy &s;hould live in brotherly love and communion with &s;uch di&s;&s;ent|ing mini&s;ters of the reformed religion as were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of benefices, and lived with decency and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the law. The epi&s;copal clergy, encouraged by the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions in their favour, drew up an addre&s;s to the queen, implor|ing her protection; and, humbly be&s;eeching her to allow tho&s;e pari&s;hes in which there was a majority of epi&s;copal freeholders, to be&s;tow the benefice on mini&s;|ters of their principles. This petition was pre&s;ented by Dr. Skeen and Dr. S$ot, who were introduced by the duke of Queen&s;berry to her maje&s;ty. She a&s;&s;ured them of her protection and endeavours to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities; and, ex$orted them to live in peace and chri&s;tian love with the clergy, who were by law inve&s;ted with the church-government in her ancient kingdom of Scotland. A proclamation of indemnity having been publi&s;hed in March, a great num|ber of Jacobites returned from France and other countries, pretended to have changed their &s;entiments, and took the oaths, that they might be qualified to &s;it in parliament. They formed an acce&s;&s;ion to the &s;trength of the antirevolu|tioners and epi&s;copalians, who now hoped to out-number the pre&s;byterians, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Torcy's Mem.

But, this confederacy was compo&s;ed of di&s;&s;onant parts, from which no harmony could be expected. The pre&s;byterians and revolu|tioners were headed by the duke of Argyle. The country$party of malcontents, which took its ri&s;e from the di&s;appointments of the Darien &s;ettlement, acted under the au&s;pices of the duke of Hamilton and marquis of Tweedale; and, the earl of Hume appeared as chief of the antirevolutioners. The different parties who now united, pur&s;ued the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite ends. The majority of the country-party were friends to the revolution, and &s;ought only redre&s;s of the grievances which the nation had &s;u&s;tained in the late reign. The antirevolutioners con&s;i|dered the acce&s;&s;ion and government of king William as an extraordinary event which they were willing to forget, believing, that all parties were &s;afe under the &s;helter of her maje&s;ty's general indemnity. The Jacobites &s;ubmitted to the queen as tutrix or regent for the prince of Wales, whom they firmly believed &s;he intended to e&s;tabli&s;h on the throne. The Whigs under Argyle, alarmed at the coalition of all their enemies, re&s;olved to procure a parliamentary &s;anction for the revolution.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1703.</NOTE> The parliament being opened on the &s;ixth day of May at Edin|burgh, by the duke of Queen&s;berry as commi&s;&s;ioner, the queen's letter was read, in which &s;he demanded a &s;upply for the maintenance of the forces, advi&s;ed them to encourage trade, and exhorted them to proceed with wi&s;dom, prudence, and unanimity. The duke of Hamilton immediately offered the draught of a
<PB N="261" REF="2640">
bill for recognizing her maje&s;ty's undoubted right and title to the imperial crown of Scotland, according to the declaration of the e&s;tates of the kingdom, con|taining the claim of right. It was immediately received; and at the &s;econd reading, the queen's advocate offered an additional clau&s;e, denouncing the penal|ties of trea&s;on again&s;t any per&s;on who &s;hould quarrel her maje&s;ty's right and title to the crown, or her exerci&s;e of the government from her actual entry to the &s;ame. This, after a long and warm debate, was carried by the concurrence of the antirevolutioners. Then the earl of Hume produced the draught of a bill for the &s;upply; and immediately after it was read, the marquis of Tweedale made an overture, that before all other bu&s;ine&s;s, the parliament would proceed to make &s;uch conditions of government, and regulations in the con&s;titution of the kingdom, to take place after the decea&s;e of her maje&s;ty and the heirs of her body, as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of their religion $nd liberty. This overture and the bill were ordered to lie upon the table; and, in the mean time, the commi&s;&s;ioner found him&s;elf involved in great perplexity. The duke of Argyle, the marquis of Annandale, and the earl of Marchmont, gave him to under&s;tand in private, that they were re&s;olved to move for an act, ratifying the revolution; and for another, confirming the pre&s;byterian government: that they would in&s;i&s;t upon their being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed before the bill of &s;upply: and, that they were certain of carrying the points at which they aimed. The commi&s;&s;ioner now found him&s;elf reduced to a very di&s;agreeable alternative. There was a ne|ce&s;&s;ity for relinqui&s;hing all hope of a &s;upply, or abandoning the antirevolutio|ners, to whom he was connected by promi&s;es of concurrence. The Whigs were determined to oppo&s;e all &s;chemes of &s;upply that &s;hould come from the cava|liers: and, the&s;e la&s;t re&s;olved to exert their whole power in preventing the con|firmation of the revolution and the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline. He fore&s;aw, that on this occa&s;ion the Whigs would be joined by the duke of Hamilton and his party, &s;o as to preponderate again&s;t the cavaliers. He endeavoured to cajole both parties; but, found the ta&s;k impracticable. He de&s;ired in parliament, that the act for the &s;upply might be read, promi&s;ing, that they &s;hould have full time afterwards to deliberate on other &s;ubjects. The marquis of Twee|dale in&s;i&s;ted upon his overture; and, after warm debates, the hou&s;e re&s;olved to proceed with &s;uch acts as might be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring the religion, liberty, and trade of the nation, before any bill for &s;upply, or other bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The marquis of Athol offered an act for the &s;ecurity of the king|dom, in ca&s;e of her maje&s;ty's decea&s;e; but, before it was read, the duke of Ar|gyle pre&s;ented his draught of a bill for ratifying the revolution, and all the acts following thereupon. An act for limiting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion after the death of her maje&s;ty and the heirs of her body, was produced by Mr. Fletcher of Saltoun. The earl of Rothes recommended another, importing, that after her maje&s;ty's death, and failing heirs of her body, no per&s;on coming to the crown of Scotland, being at the &s;ame time king or queen of England, &s;hould, as king or queen of Scotland, have power to make peace or war without the con&s;ent of parliament. The earl of Marchmont recited the draught of an act for &s;ecuring the true pro|te&s;tant religion and pre&s;byterian government; and, one was &s;ugge&s;ted by Sir Patrick John&s;ton, allowing the importation of wines and other foreign liquors. All the&s;e bills were ordered to lie upon the table. Then the earl of Strathmore produced an act for toleration to all prote&s;tants in the exerci&s;e of religious
<PB N="262" REF="2650">
wor&s;hip. But again&s;t this the general a&s;&s;embly pre&s;ented a mo&s;t violent remon|&s;trance; and the promoters of the bill fore&s;eeing that it would meet with great oppo&s;ition, allowed it to drop for the pre&s;ent. On the third day of June, the parliament pa&s;&s;ed the act for pre&s;erving the true reformed prote&s;tant religion, and confirming pre&s;byterian church-government, as agreeable to the word of God, and the only government of Chri&s;t's-church within the kingdom. The &s;ame party enjoyed a further triumph in the &s;ucce&s;s of Argyle's act, for ratify|ing and perpetuating the fir&s;t act of king William's parliament; for declaring it high trea&s;on to di&s;own the authority of that parliament; or to alter or innovate the claim of right, or any article thereof. This la&s;t clau&s;e was &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed; but at la&s;t the bill pa&s;&s;ed, with the concurrence of all the mini&s;try, except the marquis of Athole and the vi&s;count Tarbat, who began at this period to corre&s;pond with the oppo&s;ite party.</P>

<P>The cavaliers thinking them&s;elves betrayed by the duke of Queen&s;berry, who had a&s;&s;ented to the&s;e acts, fir&s;t expo&s;tulated with him on his breach of promi&s;e, and then renounced his intere&s;t, re&s;olving to &s;eparate from the court, and jointly pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures as might be for the intere&s;t of their party. But of all the bills that were produced in the cour&s;e of this remarkable &s;e&s;&s;ion, that which produced the mo&s;t violent altercation was the act of &s;ecurity, calculated to abridge the prerogative of the crown, limit the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and throw a va&s;t additional power into the hands of the parliament. It was con&s;idered paragraph by paragraph: many additions and alterations were propo&s;ed, and &s;ome adopted: inflammatory &s;peeches were uttered: bitter &s;arca&s;ms retorted from party to party: and different votes pa&s;&s;ed on different clau&s;es. At length, in &s;pite of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition from the mini&s;try and the cavaliers, it was pa&s;&s;ed by a majority of fifty-nine voices. The com|mi&s;&s;ioner was importuned to give it the royal a&s;&s;ent; but declined an&s;wering their intreaties till the tenth day of September, when he made a &s;peech in par|liament, giving them to under&s;tand that he had received the queen's plea&s;ure, and was empowered to give the royal a&s;&s;ent to all the acts voted in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, except to the act for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom. Then a motion was made, to &s;ollicit the royal a&s;&s;ent in an addre&s;s to her maje&s;ty; but the que&s;tion being put, it was carried in the negative by a &s;mall majority. On the &s;ixth day of the &s;ame month, the earl of Marchmont had produced a bill to &s;ettle the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion on the hou&s;e of Hanover. At fir&s;t the import of it was not known; but, when the clerk, in reading it, mentioned the prince&s;s Sophia, the whole hou&s;e was kindled into a flame. Some propo&s;ed that the overture &s;hould be burned: others moved that the earl might be &s;ent pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle; and a general di&s;&s;atisfaction appeared in the whole a&s;&s;embly. Not that the ma|jority in parliament were aver&s;e to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hanover: but they re&s;olved to avoid a nomination without &s;tipulating conditions; and they had already provided$ in the act of &s;ecurity, that it &s;hould be high-trea&s;on to own any per&s;on as king or queen after her maje&s;ty's decea&s;e, until he or &s;he &s;hould take the coronation oath, and accept the terms of the claim of right, and &s;uch conditions as &s;hould be &s;ettled in this or any en&s;uing parliament.</P>

that the nation would be en&s;laved, &s;hould it &s;ubmit, either willingly or by commi&s;&s;ion, to the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of England, without &s;uch conditions of govern|ment as &s;hould &s;ecure them again&s;t the influence of an Engli&s;h mini&s;try, offered the draught of an act, importing, That, after the decea&s;e of her maje&s;ty, without heirs of her body, no per&s;on being &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the Engli&s;h throne, &s;hould &s;ucceed to the crown of Scotland, but under the following limitations, which, together with the coronation-oath and claim of right, they &s;hould &s;wear to ob&s;erve: namely, That all offices and places, civil and military, as well as pen&s;ions, &s;hould for the future be conferred by parliament to be cho&s;en at every Michaelmas head-court, to &s;it on the fir&s;t day of November, and ad|journ them&s;elves from time to time, till the en&s;uing Michaelmas: That they &s;hould chu&s;e their own pre&s;ident: That a committee of &s;ix and thirty members, cho&s;en out of the whole parliament, without di&s;tinction of e&s;tates, &s;hould, during the intervals of parliament, be ve&s;ted under the king, with the admi|ni&s;tration of the government, act as his council, be accountable to parli|ament, and call it together on extraordinary occa&s;ions. He propo&s;ed that the &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould be nominated by the majority; declaring for him&s;elf, that he would rather concur in nominating the mo&s;t rigid papi&s;t with tho&s;e con|ditions, than the true&s;t prote&s;tant without them. The motion was &s;econded by many members; and though po&s;tponed for the pre&s;ent, in favour of an act of trade under the con&s;ideration of the hou&s;e, it was afterwards re&s;umed with great warmth. In vain the lord-trea&s;urer repre&s;ented, that no funds were as yet provided for the army, and moved for a reading of the act pre&s;ented for that purpo&s;e: a certain member ob&s;erved, that this was a very un&s;ea&s;onable juncture to propo&s;e a &s;upply, when the hou&s;e had &s;o much to do for the &s;e|curity of the nation: he &s;aid they had very little encouragement to grant &s;up|plies, when they found them&s;elves fru&s;trated of all their labour and expence for the&s;e &s;everal months; and, when the whole kingdom &s;aw that &s;upplies &s;erved for no other u&s;es but to gratify the avarice of &s;ome in&s;atiable mini&s;ters. Mr. Fletcher expatiated upon the good con&s;equences that would ari&s;e from the act which he had propo&s;ed. The chancellor an&s;wered, That &s;uch an act was laying a &s;cheme for a commonwealth, and tending to innovate the con|&s;titution of the monarchy. The mini&s;try propo&s;ed the &s;tate of a vote, whether they &s;hould fir&s;t give a reading to Fletcher's act, or to the act of &s;ub&s;idy. The country party moved that the que&s;tion might be, <Q>&startq;Overtures for &s;ub&s;i|dies, or overtures for liberty.&endq;</Q> Fletcher withdrew his act, rather than people &s;hould pervert the meaning of laudable de&s;igns. The hou&s;e re&s;ounded with the cry of "Liberty or &s;ub&s;idy." Bitter invectives were uttered again&s;t the mini&s;try. One member &s;aid it was now plain the nation was to expect no other return for their expence and toil, than that of being loaded with a &s;ub|&s;idy, and being obliged to bend their necks under the yoke of &s;lavery, which was prepared for them from that throne: another ob&s;erved, that as their li|berties were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, &s;o the privileges of parliament were like to be torn from them; but that he would venture his life in defence of his birthright, and rather die a free man than live a &s;lave. When the vote was demanded, and declined by the commi&s;&s;ioner, the earl of Roxburgh declared, that if there was no other way of obtaining &s;o natural and undeniable a privilege of par|liament, they would demand it with their &s;words in their hands. The com|mi&s;&s;ioner

fore&s;eeing this &s;pirit of freedom and contradiction, had ordered the foot-guards to be in readine&s;s, and placed a &s;trong guard upon the ea&s;tern gate of the city. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions, he ran the ri&s;que of being torn in pieces; and, in this apprehen&s;ion, ordered the chancellor to inform the hou&s;e, that the parliament &s;hould proceed upon overtures for liberty at their next &s;itting. This promi&s;e allayed the ferment, which had begun to ri&s;e. Next day the members prepared an overture, implying, That the elective mem|bers &s;hould be cho&s;en for every &s;eat at the Michaelmas head-courts: That a parliament &s;hould be held once in two years at lea&s;t: That the &s;hort adjourn|ments de die in diem, &s;hould be made by the parliaments them&s;elves, as in England; and, That no officer in the army, cu&s;toms, or exci&s;e, nor any gra|tuitous pen&s;ioner, &s;hould fit as an elective member. The commi&s;&s;ioner being appri&s;ed of their proceedings, called for &s;uch acts as he was impowered to pa&s;s, and having given the royal a&s;&s;ent to them, prorogued the parliament to the twelfth day of October<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though the queen refu&s;ed to pa&s;s the act of &s;ecurity, the royal a&s;&s;ent was granted to an act of limitation on the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in which it was de|clared, that no king or queen of Scotland &s;hould have power to make war or peace without con|&s;ent of parliament. Another law was enacted, allowing French wines and other liquors to be imported in neutral bottoms. Without this ex+pedient, it was alledged, that the revenue would have been in&s;ufficient to maintain the govern|ment. An act pa&s;&s;ed in favour of the company trading to Africa and the Indies; another for a commi&s;&s;ion concerning the public accounts: a third for puni&s;hing &s;landerous &s;peeches and writ|ings. The commi&s;&s;ion for treating of an union with England was vacated, with a prohibition to grant any other commi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e with|out con&s;ent of parliament; and no &s;upply having been provided before the adjournment, the army and expence of government were maintained upon credit.</NOTE>. Such was the i&s;&s;ue of this remarkable &s;e&s;&s;ion of the Scotti&s;h parliament, in which the duke of Queen&s;berry was abandoned by the greate&s;t part of the mini&s;try; and &s;uch a &s;pirit of ferocity and oppo&s;ition pre|vailed, as threatened the whole kingdom with civil war and confu&s;ion.

<P>Ireland was filled with di&s;content, by the behaviour and conduct of the tru&s;tees for the forfeited e&s;tates. The earl of Roche&s;ter had contri|buted to foment the troubles of the kingdom, by encouraging the factions which had been imported from England. The duke of Ormond was received with open arms, as heir to the virtues of his ance&s;tors, who had been the bul|warks of the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Ireland. He opened the parliament on the twenty-fir&s;t day of September, with a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, in which he told them, that his inclination, his intere&s;t, and the examples of his progenitors, were indi&s;pen&s;ible obligations upon him, to improve every opportunity to the ad|vantage and pro&s;perity of his native country. The commons having cho&s;en Allen Broderick to be their &s;peaker, proceeded to draw up very affectionate addre&s;&s;es to the queen and the lord-lieutenant. In that to the queen they complained, that their enemies had mi&s;repre&s;ented them, as de&s;irous of being
<PB N="26$" REF="2680">
independent of the crown of England: they therefore, to vindicate them&s;elves from &s;uch fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions, declared and acknowledged, that the kingdom of Ire|land was annexed and united to the imperial crown of England. In order to ex|pre&s;s their hatred of the tru&s;tees, they re&s;olved, That all the prote&s;tant free|holders of that kingdom had been fal&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented, tra|duced, and abu&s;ed, in a book intituled, "The Report of the commi&s;&s;ioners ap|pointed to inquire into the Iri&s;h forfeitures;" and it appearing, that Francis Anne&s;ley member of the hou&s;e, John Trenchard, Henry Langford, and James Hamilton, were authors of that book, they further re&s;olved, That they had &s;candalou&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented and traduced the prote&s;tant free|holders of that kingdom, and endeavoured to create a mi&s;under&s;tanding and jealou&s;y between the people of England and the prote&s;tants of Ireland. Anne&s;ley was expelled the hou&s;e, Hamilton was dead, and Trenchard had re|turned to England. They had fini&s;hed the inquiry before the meeting of this parliament; and &s;old, at an under-value, the be&s;t of the forfeited e&s;tates to the &s;word-blade company of England, who, in a petition to the Iri&s;h parliament, prayed, that heads of a bill might be brought in for enabling them to take conveyances of lands in Ireland: but the parliament was very little di&s;po&s;ed to confirm the bargains of the tru&s;tees, and the petition lay neglected on the table. The hou&s;e expelled John A&s;gill, who, as agent to the &s;word-blade company, had offered to lend money to the public in Ireland, on condition that the parliament would pa&s;s an act to confirm the company's purcha&s;e of the forfeited e&s;tates. His con&s;tituents di&s;owned his propo&s;al; and, when he was &s;ummoned to appear before the hou&s;e, and an&s;wer for his prevarication, he pleaded his privilege as member of the Engli&s;h parliament. The commons, in a repre&s;entation of the &s;tate and grievances of the nation, gave her ma|je&s;ty to under&s;tand, that the con&s;titution of Ireland had been of late greatly &s;haken; and their lives, liberties, and e&s;tates, called in que&s;tion, and tried in a manner unknown to their ance&s;tors: that the expence to which they had been unnece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed by the late tru&s;tees for the forfeited e&s;tates, in de|fending their ju&s;t rights and titles, had exceeded in value the current ca&s;h of the kingdom: that their trade was decayed, their money exhau&s;ted; and that they were hindered from maintaining their own manufactures: that many pro|te&s;tant families had been con&s;trained to quit the kingdom, in order to earn a livelihood in foreign countries: that the want of frequent parliaments in Ire|land had encouraged evil-minded men to oppre&s;s the &s;ubject: That many civil officers had acquired great fortunes in that impoveri&s;hed country, by the ex|erci&s;e of corruption and oppre&s;&s;ion: That others, in con&s;iderable employments, re&s;ided in another kingdom, neglecting per&s;onal attendance on their duty, while their offices were ill executed, to the detriment of the public, and the failure of ju&s;tice. They declared, that it was from her maje&s;ty's gracious interpo&s;ition alone, that they propo&s;ed to them&s;elves relief from tho&s;e their manifold groans and misfortunes. The commons afterwards voted the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, and granted one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds to make good the deficiencies of the nece&s;&s;ary branches of the e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>

<P>They appointed a committee to in&s;pect the public accounts, by which they di&s;covered, that above one hundred thou&s;and pounds had been fal&s;ly charged as a debt upon the nation. The committee was thanked by
<PB N="266" REF="2690">
the hou&s;e for having &s;aved this &s;um, and ordered to examine what per&s;ons were concerned in &s;uch a mi&s;repre&s;entation, which was generally imputed to tho&s;e who acted under the duke of Ormond. He him&s;elf was a nobleman of honour and genero&s;ity, addicted to plea&s;ure, and fond of popular applau&s;e: but he was &s;urrounded by people of more &s;ordid principles, who had ingratiated them&s;elves into his confidence by the arts of adulation. The commons voted a provi&s;ion for the half-pay officers; and aboli&s;hed pen&s;ions to the amount of &s;eventeen thou&s;and pounds a year, as unnece&s;&s;ary branches of the e&s;tabli&s;hment. They pa&s;&s;ed an act &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, after the pattern &s;et them by England: but the mo&s;t important tran&s;action of this &s;e&s;&s;ion was a &s;evere bill to prevent the growth of popery. It bore a &s;trong affinity to that which had pa&s;&s;ed three years before in England; but contained more effectual clau&s;es. Among others, it enacted, That all e&s;tates of papi&s;ts &s;hould be equally divided among the children, notwith&s;tanding any &s;ettlement to the contrary, unle&s;s the per&s;ons to whom they might be &s;ettled, &s;hould qualify them&s;elves by taking the oaths, and communicating with the church of England. The bill was not at all agreeable to the mini&s;try in England, who expected large pre&s;ents from the papi&s;ts, by whom a con&s;iderable &s;um had been actually rai&s;ed for this purpo&s;e. But, as they did not think proper to reject &s;uch a bill while the Engli&s;h parliament was &s;itting, they added a clau&s;e which they hoped the par|liament of Ireland would refu&s;e; namely, that no per&s;ons in that kingdom &s;hould be capable of any employment, or of being in the magi&s;tracy of any city, who did not quality them&s;elves by receiving the &s;acrament, according to the te&s;t-act pa&s;&s;ed in England. Though this was certainly a great hard&s;hip on the di&s;&s;enters, the parliament of Ireland &s;acrificed this con&s;ideration to their common &s;ecurity again&s;t the roman catholics, and accepted the amendment without he&s;itation. This affair being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the commons of Ireland pa&s;&s;ed a vote again&s;t a book intituled, "Memoirs of the late king James II." as a &s;e|ditious libel. They ordered it to be burned by the hands of the common hangman; and the book&s;eller and printer to be pro&s;ecuted. When this motion was made, a member informed the hou&s;e, that in the county of Limerick the Iri&s;h papi&s;ts had begun to form them&s;elves into bodies; to plunder the prote&s;tants of their arms and money, and to maintain a corre&s;pondence with the di&s;affected in England. The hou&s;e immediately re&s;olved, That the papi&s;ts of the kingdom &s;till retained hopes of the acce&s;&s;ion of the per&s;on known by the name of the prince of Wales in the life-time of the late king James, and now by the name of James III. In the mid&s;t of this zeal again&s;t popery and the pretender, they were &s;uddenly adjourned by command of the lord-lieutenant, and broke up in great animo&s;ity again&s;t that nobleman <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They had, be&s;ides the bills already men|tioned, pa&s;&s;ed an act for an additional exci&s;e on beer, ale, and other liquors: another encourag|ing the importation of iron and &s;taves: a third for preventing popi&s;h prie&s;ts from coming into the kingdom: a fourth &s;ecuring the liberty of the &s;ubject, and for prevention of impri&s;onment be|yond &s;eas: and a fifth for naturalizing all prote&s;tant &s;trangers.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The attention of the Engli&s;h mini&s;try had been for &s;ome time chiefly engro&s;&s;ed by the affairs of the continent. The emperor agreed with the allies, that his &s;on the archduke Charles &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the title of king of Spain, demand the infanta of Portugal in marriage, and undertake &s;omething
<PB N="267" REF="2700">
of importance, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the maritime powers. Mr. Methuen, the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter at Li&s;bon, had already made &s;ome progre&s;s in a a treaty with his Portugue&s;s maje&s;ty; and the court of Vienna promi&s;ed to &s;end &s;uch an army into the field as would in a little time drive the elector of Bavaria from his dominions. But they were &s;o dilatory in their preparations, that the French king broke all their mea&s;ures, by &s;ending powerful reinforcements to the elector, in who&s;e ability and attachment Lewis repo&s;ed great confidence. Marechal Villars, who commanded an army of thirty thou&s;and men at Stra&s;|burg, pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, and reduced fort Kehl, the garri&s;on of which was conducted to Philipsburgh. The emperor, alarmed at this event, ordered count Schlick to enter Bavaria on the &s;ide of Saltsburg, with a con&s;iderable body of forces; and &s;ent another under count Stirum, to invade the &s;ame elec|torate by the way of Newmark, which was &s;urrendered to him, after he had routed a party of Bavarians: the city of Amberg me$ with the &s;ame fate. Mean while count Schlick defeated a body of militia that defended the lines of Saltsburg, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Riedt, and &s;everal other places. The elector a&s;&s;embling his forces near Brenau, diffu&s;ed a report that he intended to be&s;iege Pa&s;&s;au, to cover which place Schlick advanced with the greate&s;t part of his infantry, leaving behind his cavalry and cannon. The elector having by this feint divided the Imperiali&s;ts, pa&s;&s;ed the bridge of Scardigen with twelve thou&s;and men, and, after an ob&s;tinate engagement, compelled the Imperiali&s;ts to abandon the field of battle; then he marched again&s;t the Saxon troops which guarded the artillery, and attacked them with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that they were intirely defeated. In a few days after the&s;e actions, he took Newburg on the Inn by capitulation. He obtained another advantage over an advanced po&s;t of the Imperiali&s;ts near Burgenfeldt, commanded by the young prince of Bran|denburg An&s;pach, who was mortally wounded in the engagement. He ad|vanced to Ratisbon, where the diet of the empire was a&s;&s;embled, and de|manded that he &s;hould be immediately put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge and gate of the city. The burghers immediately took to their arms, and planted can|non on the ramparts; but, when they &s;aw a battery erected again&s;t them, and the elector determined to bombard the place, they thought proper to capitulate, and comply with his demands. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town on the eighth day of April, and &s;igned an in&s;trument obliging him&s;elf to withdraw his troops, as &s;oon as the emperor &s;hould ratify the diet's re&s;olution for the neu|trality of Ratisbon. Marechal Villars having received orders to join the elector at all events, and being reinforced by a body of troops under count Tallard, re&s;olved to break through the lines which the prince of Baden had made at Stolhoffen. This general had been luckily joined by eight Dutch battalions, and received the French army, though double his number, with &s;uch ob&s;tinate re&s;olution, that Villars was obliged to retreat with great lo&s;s, and directed his route towards Offingen. Neverthele&s;s, he penetrated through the Black fore&s;t, and effected a junction with the elector. Count Stirum endeavoured to join prince Lewis of Baden; but being attacked near Schwemmingen, retired under the cannon of Nortlingen.</P>

<P>The confederates were more &s;ucce&s;sful on the Lower Rhine and in the Netherlands. The duke of Marlborough cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea in the beginning of April, and a&s;&s;embling the allied army, re&s;olved, that the cam|paign
<PB N="268" REF="2710">
&s;hould be begun wi$h the &s;iege of Bonne, which was accordingly inve&s;ted on the twenty-fourth day of April. Three different attacks were carried on again&s;t this place; one by the hereditary prince of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el; another by the celebrated Co$horn; and a third by the lieutenant-general Fagel. The gar$i&s;on defended them&s;elves vigorou&s;ly till the fourteenth day of May, when the $ort having been taken by a&s;&s;ault, and the breaches practicable, the mar|quis d'Alegre the governor, ordered a parley to be beat; ho&s;tages were im|mediately exchanged; on the &s;ixteenth the capitulation was &s;igned; and in three days the garri&s;on evacuated the place, in order to be conducted to Luxemburg. During the &s;iege of Bonne, the marechals Boufflers and Villeroy advanced with an army of forty t$ou&s;and men towards Tongeren, and the confederate army commanded by Overkirk was obliged at their approach to retreat under the cannon of Mae&s;tricht. The enemy having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tongeren, made a motion again&s;t the confederate army, which they found already drawn up in order of battle, and &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, that, notwith&s;tanding their great &s;uperiori$y in point of number, they would not hazard an attack; but retired to the ground from whence they had advanced. Immediately after the reduction of Bonne, the duke of Marlborough, who had been pre&s;ent at the &s;iege, returned to the confederate army in the Netherlands, now amount|ing to one hundred and thirty &s;quad$ons, and fifty-nine battalions. On the twenty fifth day of May, the duke having pa&s;&s;ed the river Jecker, in ord$r to give battle to the enemy, they marched with precipitation to Boekwern, and abandoned Tongeren, after having blown up the walls of the place with gunpowder. The duke continued to follow them to Thys, where he encamped, wh$le they retreated to Hannye, retiring as he advanced. Then he re&s;olved to force their lines; and this &s;ervice was effectually performed by Coehorn, at the point of Callo, and by baron Spaar in the county of Waes, near Stoken. The duke had formed the de&s;ign of $educing Antwerp, which was garri&s;oned by Span$$h troops, under the command of the marquis de Bedmar. He in|tended with the grand army to attack the enemy's lines on the &s;ide of Lou|vaine and Mechlin, while he detached Coehorn with his flying camp on the right of the Scheld, towards Dutch Flanders, to amu&s;e the marquis de Bedmar on that &s;ide; and he ordered the baron Opdam with twelve thou&s;and men to take po&s;t between Eckeren and Capelle near Antwerp, that he might act again&s;t that part of the lines which was guarded by the Spani&s;h forces.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The French generals, in order to fru&s;trate the &s;cheme of Marlborough, re&s;olved to cut off the retreat of Opdam. Boufflers, with a de|tachment of twenty thou&s;and men from Villeroy's army, &s;urpri&s;ed him at Eckeren, where the Dutch were put in di&s;order; and Opdam believing all was lo&s;t, fled to Bred$. Neverthele&s;s, the troops ral$ying $nder general Schlan|genburg, maintained their ground with the mo&s;t ob&s;tin$te valour, till night, when the enemy was obliged to retire, and left the communication free with fort Lillo, to which place the confederates marched without further mole&s;tation, having lo&s;t about fifteen hundred men in the engagement. The damage &s;u&s;tained by the French was more con&s;iderable. They were fru&s;trated in their de&s;ign, and had actually abandoned the field of battle; yet Lewis ordered Te Deum to be &s;ung for the victory: neverthele&s;s, Bouf$lers was cen&s;ured for his conduct on this occa&s;ion, and in a little time totally di&s;graced. Opdam
<PB N="26$" REF="2720">
pre&s;ented a ju&s;tification of his conduct to the &s;tates-general; but by this over|&s;ight forfeited the fruits of a long &s;ervice, during which he had exhibited re|peated proofs of courage, zeal, and capacity. The &s;tates honoured Schlan|genburg with a letter of thanks for the valour and &s;kill he had manife&s;ted in this engagement; but, in a little time they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from his employ|ment, on account of his having given umbrage to the duke of Marlborough, by cen&s;uring his grace for expo&s;ing &s;uch a &s;mall number of men to this di&s;a&s;ter. After this action Villeroy, who lay encamped near St. Job, declared he would wait for the duke of Marlborough, who forthwith advanced to Hoog&s;traat with a view to give him battle: but, at his approach, the French general &s;etting fire to his camp, retired within his lines with great precipitation. Then the duke inve&s;ted Huy, the garri&s;on of which, after a vigorous defence, &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, on the twenty-&s;eventh day of Augu&s;t. At a council of war held in the camp of the confederates, the duke propo&s;ed to attack the enemy's lines between the Mehaigne and Leuwe, and was &s;econded by the Dani&s;h, Hanoverian, and He&s;&s;ian generals; but the &s;cheme was op|po&s;ed by the Dutch officers and the deputies of the &s;tates, who alledged that the &s;ucce&s;s was dubious, and the con&s;equences of forcing the lines incon&s;ider|able. They therefore recommended the &s;iege of Limburg, by the reduction of which they would acquire a whole province, and cover their own country, as well as Juliers and Gueldres, from the de&s;igns of the enemy. The &s;iege of Limburg was accordingly undertaken. The trenches were opened on the five and twentieth day of September, and in two days the place was &s;urrendered; the garri&s;on remaining pri&s;oner of war. By this conque&s;t the allies &s;ecured the country of Liege, and the electorate of Cologne, from the incur&s;ions of the ene|my; and before the end of the year, they remained ma&s;ters of the whole Spani&s;h Guelderland, by the reduction of Gueldres, which &s;urrendered on the &s;eventeenth day of September, after having been long blockaded, bombarded, and re|duced to a heap of a$hes, by the Pru&s;&s;ian general Lottum. Such was the campaign in the Netherlands, which in all probability would have produced events of greater importance, had not the duke of Marlborough been re|&s;tricted by the deputies of the &s;tates-general, who began to be influenced by the intrigu$s of the Louve&s;tein faction, ever aver&s;e to a &s;ingle dictator.</P>

<P>The French king redoubled his efforts in Germany. The duke of Vendome was ordered to march from the Milane&s;e to Tyrol, and there join the el$ctor of Bavaria, who had already made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of In&s;pruck. But the boors ri&s;ing in arms, drove him out of the country before he could be joined by the French general, who was therefore obliged to return to the Mi|lane&s;e. The Imperiali&s;ts in Italy were &s;o ill &s;upplied by the court of Vienna, that they could not pretend to act offen&s;ively. The French inve&s;ted O&s;tiglia, which, however, they could not reduce: but the fortre&s;s of Bar&s;illo, in the dutchy of Reggio, capitulating after a long blockade, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the duke of Modena's country. The elector of Bavaria rejoining Villars, re|&s;olved to attack count Stirum, whom prince Lewis of Baden had detached from his army. With this view they pa&s;&s;ed the Danube at Donawert, and di&s;|charged &s;ix guns as a &s;ignal for the marquis D'U&s;&s;on, whom they had left in the camp at Lavingen, to $all upon the rear of the Imperiali&s;ts, while they &s;hould charge them in front. Stirum no &s;ooner perceived the &s;ignal, than he gue&s;&s;ed the intention of the enemy, and in&s;tantly re&s;olved to attack D'U&s;&s;on before
<PB N="270" REF="2730">
the elector and the marechal &s;hould advance. He accordingly charged him at the head of &s;ome &s;elect &s;quadrons, with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity that the French cavalry was totally defeated; and all his infantry would have been killed and taken, had not the elector and Villars come up in time to turn the fate of the battle, which continued from &s;ix in the morning to four in the afternoon, when Stirum being overpowered by numbers, was obliged to retreat to Norlingen with the lo&s;s of twelve thou&s;and men, and all his baggage and a$tillery. In the mean time, the duke of Burgundy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Tallard, undertook the &s;iege of Old Bri&s;ac, with a prodigious train of artillery. The place was very &s;trongly for|tified, though the garri&s;on was &s;mall and ill provided with nece&s;&s;aries. In four|teen days, the governor &s;urrendered the place, and was condemned to lo&s;e his head for having made &s;uch a &s;lender defence. The duke of Burgundy returned in triumph to Ver&s;ailles, and Tallard was ordered to inve&s;t Landau. The prince of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el being detached from the Netherlands for the relief of the place, joined the count of Na&s;&s;au-Wellburg general of the Palat$ne forces, near Spires, where they re&s;olved to attack the French in their lines. But by this time mon|&s;ie$$ Pracontal with ten thou&s;and men had joined Tallard, and enabled him to &s;trike a &s;troke which proved deci&s;ive. He &s;uddenly quitted his lines, and &s;ur|pri&s;ed the prince at Spirebach, where the French obtained a complete victory, after a very ob&s;tinate and bloody engagement, in which the prince of He&s;&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by uncommon marks of courage and pre&s;ence of mind. Three hor&s;es were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively killed under him, and he &s;lew a French officer with his own hand. After incredible efforts, he was &s;ain to retreat with the lo&s;s of &s;ome thou&s;ands. The French payed dear for their victory, Pracontal having been &s;lain in the action. Neverthele&s;s, they re&s;umed the &s;iege, and the place was &s;urrendered by capitulation. The campaign in Germany was fini&s;hed with the reduction of Aug&s;burg by the elector of Bavaria, who took it in the month of December, and agreed to its being &s;ecured by a French garri&s;on.</P>

<P>The emperor's affairs at this juncture wore a very unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect. The Hungarians were fleeced and barbarou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e to whom he intru&s;ted the government of their country. They derived courage from de&s;|pair. They &s;eized this opportunity when the emperor's forces were divided, and his councils di&s;tracted, to exert them&s;elves in defence of their liberties. They ran to arms under the au&s;pices of prince Ragotzki. They demanded that their grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed, and their privileges re&s;tored. Their re&s;entment was kept up by the emi&s;&s;aries of France and Bavaria, who likewi&s;e encouraged them to per&s;evere in their revolt, by repeated promi&s;es of protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The emperor's pro&s;pect, however, was &s;oon mended by two incidents of very great con&s;equence to his intere&s;t. The duke of Savoy fore&s;eeing how much he would lie expo&s;ed to the mercy of the French king, &s;hould that monarch become ma&s;ter of the Milane&s;e, engaged in a &s;ecret nego|tiation with the emperor, which, notwith&s;tanding all his caution, was di&s;|covered by the court of V$r&s;ailles. Lewis immediately ordered the duke of Vendome to di&s;arm the troops of Savoy that were in his army, to the number of two and twenty thou&s;and men: to in&s;i&s;t upon the duke's putting him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of four con&s;iderable fortre&s;&s;es; and demand that the number of his troops &s;hould be reduced to the e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;tipulated in the treaty of one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and ninety-&s;ix. The duke, exa&s;perated at the&s;e in&s;ults, ordered the French amba&s;&s;ador, and &s;everal officers of the &s;ame
<PB N="271" REF="2740">
nation, to be arre&s;ted; and Lewis endeavoured to intimidate him by a me|nacing letter, in which he gave him to under&s;tand, that &s;ince neither religion, honour, intere&s;t, nor alliances, had been able to influence his conduct, the duke of Vendome &s;hould make known the intentions of the French mo|narch, and allow him four and twenty hours to deliberate on the mea&s;ures he &s;hould pur&s;ue. This letter was an&s;wered by a manife&s;to: in the mean time the duke concluded a treaty with the court of Vienna; acknowledged the archduke Charles as king of Spain; and &s;ent envoys to England and Holland. Queen Anne knowing his importance, as well as his &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, a&s;&s;ured him of her friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and both &s;he and the &s;tates &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Turin. He was immediately joined by a body of Imperial hor&s;e under Vi&s;conti, and afterwards by count Staremberg, at the head of fifteen thou&s;and men, with whom he marched from the Modene&s;e in the wor&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year, through an enemy's country, and roads that were deemed impa&s;&s;able, while the French forces harra&s;&s;ed him in his march, and even &s;urrounded him in many different places on the route. He &s;urmounted all the&s;e difficulties with incredible courage and per&s;everance, and joined the duke of Savoy at Ca|nelli, &s;o as to &s;ecure the country of Piedmont. The other incident which proved &s;o favourable to the Imperial intere&s;t, was a treaty by which the king of Por|tugal acceded to the grand alliance. His mini&s;try perceived, that &s;hould Spain be once united to the crown of France, their ma&s;ter would &s;it very in&s;ecure upon his throne. They were intimidated by the united fleets of the maritime powers, which maintained the empire of the &s;ea; and they were allured by the &s;plendor of a match between their infanta and the archduke Charles, to whom the emperor and the king of the Romans &s;hould transfer all their preten&s;ions to the Spani&s;h crown. By this treaty, concluded at Lifbon, between the em|peror, the queen of Great Britain, the king of Portugal, and the &s;tates-ge|neral, it was &s;tipulated, That king Charles &s;hould be conveyed to Portugal by a powerful fleet, having on board twelve thou&s;and &s;oldiers, with a great &s;upply of money, arms, and ammunition; and that he &s;hould be joined immediately upon his landing, by an army of eight and twenty thou&s;and Portugue&s;e.</P>

<P>The confederates reaped very little advantage from the naval ope|rations of this &s;ummer. Sir George Rooke crui&s;ed in the channel, in order to alarm the coa&s;t of France, and protect the trade of England. On the fir&s;t day of July, Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel &s;ailed from St. Helen's, with the combined &s;quadrons of England and Holland: he directed his cour&s;e to the Mediter|ranean, and being reduced to great difficulty by want of water, &s;teered to Altea on the coa&s;t of Valentia, where brigadier Seymour landed and encamped with five and twenty hundred marines. The admiral publi&s;hed a &s;hort manife&s;to, &s;igni&s;ying that he was not come to di&s;turb, but to protect the good &s;ubjects of Spain, who &s;hould &s;wear allegiance to their lawful monarch the archduke Charles, and endeavour to &s;hake off the yoke of France. This declaration produced little or no effect; and the fleet being watered, &s;ailed to Leghorn. One de&s;ign of this armament was to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Cevennois, who had in the cour&s;e of the preceding year been per&s;ecuted into a revolt on account of religion, and implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England and the &s;tates-general. The admiral de|tached two &s;hips into the gulph of Narbo$ne with &s;ome refugees and French pilots, who had concerted &s;ignals with the Cevennois; but the marechal de
<PB N="272" REF="2750">
Montrevil having received intimation of their de&s;ign, took &s;uch mea&s;ures as prevented all communication; and the Engli&s;h captains having repeated their &s;ignals to no purpo&s;e, rejoined Sir Cloude&s;ley at Leghorn. This admiral having renewed the peace with the pyratical &s;tates of Barbary, returned to England, without having taken one effectual &s;tep for annoying the enemy, or attempted any thing that looked like the re&s;ult of a concerted &s;cheme for that purpo&s;e. The nation naturally murmured at this fruitle&s;s expedition, by which it had incurred &s;uch a con&s;iderable expence. The merchants complained that they were ill &s;upplied with convoys. The &s;hips of war were victualled with damaged provi&s;ion; and every article of the marine being mi&s;managed, the blame fell upon tho&s;e who acted as council to the lord high-admiral.</P>

<P>Nor were the arms of England by &s;ea much more &s;ucce&s;sful in the We&s;t Indies. Sir George Rooke, in the preceding year, had detached from the Mediterranean captain Hovenden Walker with &s;ix &s;hips of the line and tran&s;ports, having on board four regiments of &s;oldiers, for the Leewardi&s;lands. Being joined at Antigua by &s;ome troops under colonel Coddrington, they made a de&s;cent upon the i&s;land Guadaloupe, where they razed the fort, burned the town, ravaged the country, and reimbarked with precipitation, in con&s;equence of a report that the French had landed nine hundred men on the back of the i&s;$and. They retired to Nevis, where they mu&s;t have peri&s;he$ by famine, had not they been provi|dentially relieved by vice-admiral Graydon, in his w$y to Jamaica. This officer had been &s;ent out with three &s;$ips to &s;ucc$ed B$nbow, and was con|voyed about one hundred and fifty leagues by two other &s;hips of the line. He had not failed many days, when he fell in with part of the French &s;quadron commanded by Du Ca&s;&s;e, on their return from the We&s;$ Indies, very foul and richly laden. Captain Cleland of the Montague engaged the &s;ternmo&s;t; but he was called off by a &s;ignal from the admiral, who proceeded on his voyage without taking farther notice of the enemy. When he arrived at Jamaica, he quarrelled with the principal planters of the i&s;land; and his &s;hips beginning to be crazy, he re&s;olved to return to England. He accordingly &s;ailed through the gulph of Florida, with a view to attack the French at Placentia, in New|foundland; but his &s;hips were di&s;per&s;ed in a fog that la&s;ted thirty days; and afterwards the council of war which he convoked were of opinion, that he could not attack the &s;ettlement with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. At his return to England, the hou&s;e of lords then &s;itting &s;et on foot an inquiry into his conduct. They pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the queen, de&s;iring &s;he would remove him from his employments; and he was accordingly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The only exploit that tended to the di&s;tre&s;s of the enemy, was performed by rear-admiral Dilkes, who, in the month of July, &s;ailed to the coa&s;t of France with a &s;mall &s;quadron; and, in the neighbourhood of Granville, took or de&s;troyed about forty &s;hips and their convoy. Yet this damage was incon&s;iderable when com|pared to that which the Engli&s;h navy &s;u&s;tained from the dreadful tempe&s;t that began to blow on the twenty-&s;eventh day of November, accompanied with &s;uch fla&s;hes of lightening, and peals of thunder, as overwhelmed the whole kingdom with con&s;ternation. The hou&s;es in London &s;hook from their foundations, and &s;ome of them falling, buried the inhabitants in their ruins. The water over|flowed &s;everal &s;treets, and ro&s;e to a con&s;iderable tide in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. London-bridge was almo&s;t choaked up with the wrecks of ve&s;&s;els that peri&s;hed
<PB N="273" REF="2760">
in the river. The lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the capital was computed at a million &s;ter|ling; and the city of Bri&s;tol &s;uffered to a prodigious amount: but the chief na|tional damage fell upon the navy. Thirteen &s;hips of war were lo&s;t, together with fifteen hundred &s;eamen, including rear-admiral Beaumont, who had been employed in ob&s;erving the Dunkirk &s;quadron, and was then at anchor in the Downs, where his &s;hip foundered. This great lo&s;s, however, was repaired with incredible diligence, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all Europe. The queen imme|diately i&s;&s;ued orders for building a greater number of &s;hips than that which had been de&s;troyed; and &s;he exerci&s;ed her bounty for the relief of the &s;hipwrecked &s;eamen, and the widows of tho&s;e who were drowned, in &s;uch a manner as en|deared her to all her &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>The emperor having declared his &s;econd &s;on Charles king of Spain, that young prince &s;et out from Vienna to Holland, and at Du$$eldorp was vi&s;ited by the duke of Marlborough, who, in the name of his mi&s;t$e&s;s, congratulated him upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Spain. Charles received him with the mo&s;t obliging courte&s;y. In the cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation, taking off his &s;word, he pre&s;ented it to the Engli&s;h general, with a very gra|cious a&s;pect, &s;aying, in the French language, <Q>&startq;I am not a&s;hamed to own my|&s;elf a poor prince. I po&s;&s;e&s;s nothing but my cloak and &s;word: the latter may be of u&s;e to your grace; and I hope you will not think it the wor&s;e for my wearing it one day.&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;On the contrary (replied the duke) it will al|ways put me in mind of your maje&s;ty's ju&s;t right and title, and of the ob|ligations I lie under to hazard my life in making you the greate&s;t prince in Chri&s;tendom.&endq;</Q> This nobleman returned to England in October; and king Charles embarking for the &s;ame kingdom, under convoy of an Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;quadron, arrived at Spithead on the twenty-&s;ixth day of September. There he was received by the dukes of Somer&s;et and Marlborough, who con|ducted him to Wind&s;or; and on the road he was met by prince George of Denmark. The queen's deportment towards him was equally noble and oblig|ing; and he expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect and veneration for this il|lu&s;trious prince&s;s. He &s;poke but little; yet what he &s;aid was judicious; and he behaved with &s;uch politene&s;s and affability as conciliated the affection of the Engli&s;h nobility. After having been magnificently entertained for three days, he returned to Port&s;mouth, from whence, on the fourth of January, he &s;ailed for Portugal, with a great fleet, commanded by Sir George Rooke, having on board a body of land-forces under the duke of Schomberg. When the admiral had almo&s;t reached cape Fini&s;terre, he was driven back by a &s;torm to Spithead, where he was obliged to remain to the middle of February. Then being favoured with a fair wind, he happily performed the voyage to Li&s;bon, where king Charles was received with great &s;plendour, though the court of Portugal was over|&s;pread with &s;orrow, excited by the death of the infanta, whom the king of Spain intended to e&s;pou&s;e. In Poland, all hope of peace &s;eemed to vani&s;h. The cardinal-primate, by the in&s;tigation of the Swedi&s;h king, who&s;e army lay encamped in the neighbourhood of Dantzick, a&s;&s;embled a diet at War&s;aw, which &s;olemnly depo&s;ed Augu&s;tus, and declared the throne vacant. Their in|tention was to elect young Sobie&s;ki, &s;on of their late monarch, who re&s;ided at Bre&s;l$w in Sile&s;ia: but their &s;cheme was anticipated by Augu&s;tus, who retired ha&s;tily into his Saxon dominions, and &s;eizing Sobie&s;$i with his brother, &s;ecured th$m as pri&s;oners at Dre&s;den.</P>

She recommended di&s;patch and union; $word$ e$rn$&s;t$y exhorted them to avoid any heats or divi&s;ions that might give encouragement to the common enemies of the church and &s;tate. Notwith&s;tanding this admo|nition, and the addre&s;&s;es of both hou&s;es, in which they promi&s;ed to avoid all divi&s;ions, a motion was made in the hou&s;e of commons for renewing the b$$l again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity; and carried by a great majority. In the new draught, however, the penalties were lowered, and the &s;$ver$$t clau&s;es mitigated. As the court no longer intere&s;ted it&s;elf in the &s;ucce&s;s of this mea&s;ure, the hou&s;e was pretty equally divided with re&s;pect to the &s;peakers, and the debates on each &s;ide were maintained with equal &s;$irit and ability: at length, it pa&s;ied$ and was &s;ent up to the lords, who handled it full more &s;everely. It was oppo&s;ed by a &s;mall majority of the bi&s;hops, and particularly, by Burnet of Sarum, who de|claimed again&s;t it as a &s;cheme of the papi&s;ts, to &s;et the church and prote&s;tants at variance. It was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively att$cked by the duke of D$von&s;hire, the earl of Pembroke, the lords Haver&s;ham, Mohun, Ferrars, and Wharton. Prince George of Denmark ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the hou&s;e: and, the que&s;tion being put for a &s;econd reading, it was carried in the negative; yet, the duke of Marlborough and lord Godolphin entered their di&s;&s;$nt again&s;t its being rejected, though the former had po&s;itively declared, that he thought the bill un&s;ea&s;onable. The commons having peru&s;ed a copy of the treaty with Portugal, voted forty thou|&s;and men, including five thou&s;and marines, for the &s;ea-&s;ervice of the en&s;uing year; a like number of land forces, to act in conjunction with the allies, be&s;ides the additional ten thou&s;and; and, they re&s;olved, That the proportion to be employed in Portugal &s;hould amount to eight thou&s;and. Sums were granted for the maintenance of the&s;e great armaments, as well as for the &s;ub&s;iates payable to her maje&s;ty's allies; and funds appointed equal to the occa&s;ion. Then they a&s;&s;ured the queen, in an addre&s;s, that they would provide for the &s;upport of &s;uch alliances as &s;he had made, or &s;hould make with the duke of Savoy.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; II.</HEAD>
<P>At this period the nation was alarmed by the detection of a con&s;piracy &s;aid to be hatched by the Jacobites of Scotland. Simon Fra&s;er lord Lova$, a man of de&s;perate enterprize, profound di&s;&s;imulation, abandoned morals, and ruined fortune, who had been outlawed for having ravi&s;hed a &s;i&s;ter of the mar|quis of Athol, was the per&s;on to whom the plot &s;eems to have owed its origin. He repaired to the court of St. Germain's, where he undertook to a&s;&s;emble a body of twelve thou&s;and Highlanders to act in favour of the pretender, if the court of France would a&s;&s;i&s;t them with a &s;mall reinforcement of troops, toge|ther with officers, arms, ammunition, and money. The French king &s;eemed to li&s;ten to the propo&s;al; but, as Fra&s;er's character was infamous, he doubted his veracity. He was, therefore, &s;ent back to Scotland with two other per&s;ons, who were in&s;tructed to learn the &s;trength and &s;entiments of the clans, and en|deavour to engage &s;ome of the nobility in the de&s;ign of an in&s;urrection. Fra&s;er no &s;ooner returned than he privately di&s;covered the whole tran&s;action to the duke of Queensberry, and undertook to make him acquainted with the whole corre&s;pondence between the pretender and the Jacobites. In con&s;equence of this &s;ervice he was provided with a pa&s;s, to &s;ecure him from all pro&s;ecution; and made a progre&s;s through the Highlands, to found the inclination of the chief|tains.
<PB N="276" REF="2790">
Before he &s;et but on this circuit, he delivered to the duke a letter from the queen dowager at St. Germain's, directed to the marqui&s;s of Athol: it was douched in general terms, and &s;uper&s;cribed in a different character; &s;o that in all probability. Fra&s;er had forged the direction, with a view to ruin the marquis, who $word$ $word$ him for the injury done to his &s;i&s;ter. He propo&s;ed a &s;econd journey to $word$ where he &s;hould be able to di&s;cover other more ma|terial $word$ and the $word$ of Queensburry procured a pa&s;s for him to go to Holland from the earl of Nottingham, though it was expedited under a $span$ The $word$ had communicated his di&s;covery to the queen, with|out $word$ his name, which he $word$ might be concealed; and, her maje&s;ty $word$ the particulars, which were confirmed by her &s;pies at Paris, as well as by the evidence of Sir John Maclean, who had lately been conveyed from France to $agland in $span$ and apprehended at Folk&s;tone. This gentleman pretended at fir&s;t, that $span$ was to go thro' England to his own country, in order to take the $word$ of the Queen's pardon; and, this, in all probability, was his real de&s;ign; but, being given to under&s;tand, that he would be treated in Eng|land as a traitor, $word$ $e &s;hould merit forgivene&s;s by making important di&s;|coveries, he related all he knew of the purpo&s;ed in&s;urrection. From his infor|mation the mini&s;try gave direction, for apprehending one Keith, who&s;e uncle had accompanied Fra&s;er from France, and knew all the intrigues of the court of St. Germain's. He declared, that there was no other de&s;ign a-foot, except that of paving the way for the pretender's a&s;cending the throne after the queen's decea&s;e. Fergu&s;or, that veteran con&s;pirator, affirmed, that Fra&s;er had been employed by the duke of Queensberry to decoy &s;ome per&s;ons whom he hate$$ into a con&s;piracy, that he might have an opportunity to effect their ruin; and, by the di&s;covery e&s;tabli&s;h his own credit, which began to totter. Perhaps, there was too much rea&s;on for this imputation. Among tho&s;e who were &s;eized at this time, was a gentleman of the name of Lina&s;ay, who had been under-&s;ecretary to the earl of Middleton. He had returned from France to Scotland, in order to take the benefit of the queen's pardon, under the &s;helter of which he came to England, thinking him&s;elf &s;ecure from pro&s;ecution. He prote&s;ted, he knew of no de&s;igns again&s;t the queen or her government; and, that he did not believe &s;he would ever receive the lea&s;t injury or mole&s;tation from the court of St. Germain's. The hou&s;e of lords having received intimation of this con|&s;piracy, re&s;olved, That a committee &s;hould be appointed to examine into the particulars; and, ordered, That Sir John Maclean &s;hould be next day brought to their hou&s;e. The queen, who was far from being plea&s;ed with this in&s;tance of their officious interpo&s;ition, gave them to under&s;tand by me&s;&s;age, that $$e thought it would be $word$ to change the method of examination $word$ ready begun; and, that &s;he would in a &s;hort time inform the hou&s;e of the whole affair. On the &s;eventeenth day of December the queen went to the hou&s;e of peers, and having pa&s;&s;ed the bill for the land-tax, made a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, in which &s;he declared, that &s;he had unque&s;tionable information of i$l practices and de&s;igns carried on by the emi&s;&s;aries of France in Scotland. The lords per&s;i&s;ting in their re&s;olution to bring the inquiry into their own hou&s;e, cho&s;e their &s;elect committee by ballot; and, in an addre&s;s thanked her maje&s;ty for the information &s;he had been plea&s;ed to communicate.</P>

<P>The commons taking it for granted, that the queen was di&s;obliged at the&s;e proce$$ings of the upper hou&s;e, which indeed implied an in&s;ult upon her
<PB N="277" REF="2800">
mini&s;try, if not upon her&s;elf, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, declaring them&s;elves &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that when per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of trea&s;onable practices were taken into cu&s;|tody by her maje&s;ty's me&s;&s;engers, in order to be examined, the lords, in viola|tion to the known laws of the land, had wre&s;ted them out of her hands, and ar|rogated the examination &s;olely to them&s;elves; &s;o that a due inquiry into the evil practices and de&s;igns again&s;t her maje&s;ty's per&s;on and government might in a great mea&s;ure be ob&s;tructed. They earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that &s;he would &s;uffer no diminution of the prerogative; and, they a&s;&s;ured her they would, to the utmo&s;t of their power, &s;upport her in the exerci&s;e of it at home, as well as in a&s;&s;erting it again&s;t all inva&s;ions what&s;oever. The queen thanked them for their concern and a&s;&s;urances; and, was not ill plea&s;ed at the nature of the addre&s;s, though the charge again&s;t the peers was not &s;trictly true: for, there were many in&s;tances of their having a&s;&s;umed &s;uch a right of inquiry. The upper hou&s;e deeply re|&s;ented the accu&s;ation. They declared, that by the known laws and cu&s;toms of parliament, they had an undoubted right to take examinations of per&s;ons charged with criminal matters, whether tho&s;e per&s;ons were or were not in cu&s;tody. They re&s;olved, That the addre&s;s of the commons was unparliamentary, ground|le&s;s, without precedent, highly injurious to the hou&s;e of peers, tending to inter|rupt the good corre&s;pondence between the two hou&s;es, to create an ill opinion in her maje&s;ty of the hou&s;e of peers, of dangerous con&s;equence to the liberties of the people, the con&s;titution of the kingdom, and privileges of parliament. They pre&s;ented a long remon&s;trance to the queen, ju&s;tifying their own conduct, explaining the &s;teps they had taken, recriminating upon the commons; and, expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;ervent zeal, duty, and affection to her maje&s;ty. In her an&s;wer to this repre&s;entation, which was drawn up with elegance, propriety, and preci&s;ion, &s;he profe&s;&s;ed her &s;orrow for the mi&s;under&s;tanding which had happened between the two hou&s;es of parliament, and thanked them for the concern they had expre&s;&s;ed for the rights of the crown and the prerogative, which &s;he &s;hould never exert &s;o willingly as for the good of her &s;ubjects, and the protection of their liberties.</P>

<P>Among other per&s;ons &s;eized on the coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex, on their landing from France, was one Boucher, who had been aid-du-camp to the duke of Ber|wick. When examined, he denied all knowledge of any con&s;piracy; and &s;aid, that being weary of living &s;o long abroad, and having made &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to obtain a pa&s;s, he had cho&s;en rather to ca&s;t him&s;elf on the queen's mercy, than to remain longer in exile from his native country. He was tried and condemned for high-trea&s;on, yet continued to declare him&s;elf ignorant of the plot. He proved, that in the war of Ireland as well as in Flanders, he had treated the Engli&s;h pri&s;oners with great humanity. The lords de&s;i&s;ted from the pro&s;ecution; he obtained a reprieve, and died in Newgate. On the twenty|ninth day of January the earl of Nottingham told the hou&s;e, that the queen had commanded him to lay before them the papers containing all the particu|lars hitherto di&s;covered of the con&s;piracy in Scotland; but, that there was one circum&s;tance which could not yet be properly communicated, without running the ri&s;que of preventing a di&s;covery of greater importance. They forthwith drew up and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, de&s;iring, that all the papers might be immediately &s;ubmitted to their in&s;pection. She &s;aid, &s;he did not expect to be pre&s;&s;ed in this manner immediately after the declaration &s;he had made; but, in a few days the
<PB N="278" REF="2810">
earl of Nottingham delivered the papers &s;ealed to the hou&s;e, and all the lords were $ummened to attend on the eighth day of February, that they might be opened and peru&s;ed. Nottingham was &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign to &s;ti$le the con&s;pi|ra$y. Complaint was made in the hou&s;e of commons, that he had di&s;charged an officer belonging to the late king James, who had been &s;eized by the gover|nor of Berwick. A warm debate en&s;ued, and at length ended in a re&s;olve, That the earl of Nottingham, one of her maje&s;ty's principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, for his great ability and $iligence in the execution of his office, for his unque&s;tionable fide$$ty to the queen and her government, and for his &s;teady adhering to the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, highly merited the tru&s;t her maje&s;ty had repo&s;ed in him. They ordered the &s;peaker to pre&s;ent this re&s;olution to the queen, who &s;aid, &s;he was glad to find them &s;o well &s;atisfied with the earl of Nottingham, who was tru&s;ted by her in &s;o con&s;iderable an office. They peru&s;ed the examination of the witne&s;&s;es which were layed before them, without pa&s;&s;ing judgment or offering advice on the &s;ubject; but, they thanked her maje&s;ty for having communicated tho&s;e particulars, as well as for her wi&s;dom and care of the nation. When the lords proceeded with uncommon eagerne&s;s in their in|quity, the lower hou&s;e, in another addre&s;s, renewed their complaints again&s;t the conduct of the peers, which they &s;till affirmed was without a precedent. But, this was the language of irritated faction, by which indeed both &s;ides were equally actuated.</P>

<P>The &s;elect committee of the lords pro&s;ecuted the inquiry, and founded their report chiefly on the confe&s;&s;ion of Sir John Maclean, who owned, that the court of St. Germain's had li&s;tened to Lovat's propo&s;al: that &s;everal councils had been held at the pretender's court on the &s;ubject of an inva&s;ion; and, per|&s;ons &s;ent over to &s;ound &s;ome of the nobility in Scotland. But, the nature of their private corre&s;pondence and negotiation could not be di&s;covered. Keith had tampered with his uncle to di&s;clo&s;e the whole &s;ecret; and, this was the circum&s;tance which the queen declined imparting to the lords, until &s;he &s;hould know the &s;ucce&s;s of his endeavours, which proved ineffectual. The uncle &s;tood aloof; and, the mini&s;try did not heartily engage in the i$quiry. The hou&s;e of lords having fini&s;hed the&s;e examinations, and being warmed with violent de|bates, voted, That there had been dangerous plots between &s;ome per&s;ons in Scotland and the courts of France and St. Germain's: and, That the encou|ragement for this plotting aro&s;e from the not &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Scotland in the hou&s;e of Hanover. The&s;e votes were &s;ignified to the queen in an addre&s;s; and, they promi&s;ed, that when the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be thus &s;et|tled, they would endeavour to promote the union of the two kingdoms upon ju&s;t and rea&s;onable terms. Then they compo&s;ed another repre&s;entation, in an|&s;wer to the &s;econd addre&s;s of the commons, touching their proceedings. They charged the lower hou&s;e with want of zeal in the whole progre&s;s of this inquiry. They produced a great number of precedents, to prove that their con$uct had been regular and parliamentary; and they, in their turn, accu&s;ed the commons of part$al$ty and inju&s;tice in vacating legal elections. The queen, in an&s;wer to this remon&s;trance, &s;aid, &s;he looked upon any mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween the two hou&s;es as a very great mis$ortune to the kingdom: and, that &s;he &s;hould never omit any thing in her power to prevent all occa&s;ions of them for the future.</P>

<P>The lords and commons, animated by &s;uch oppo&s;ite principles, &s;eized every opportunity of thwarting each other. An action having been brought by one Matthew A&s;hby again&s;t William White and the other con&s;tables of Ayle&s;bury, for having denied him the privilege of voting in the la&s;t election, the cau&s;e was tried at the a&s;&s;izes, and the con&s;tables were ca&s;t with damages. But, an order was given in the queen's bench to qua&s;h all the proceedings, &s;ince no action had ever been brought on that account. The cau&s;e being moved by writ of error into the hou&s;e of lords, was argued with great warmth; at length, it was carried by a great majority, that the order of the queen's-bench &s;hould be &s;$t a&s;ide, and judgment pronounced according to the verdict given at the a&s;&s;izes. The commons con&s;idered the&s;e proceedings as encroachments on their privileges. They pa&s;&s;ed five different re&s;olutions, importing, That the com|mons of England in parliament a&s;&s;embled had the &s;ole right to examine, and determine all matters relating to the right of election of their own members: That the practice of determining the qualifications of electors in any court of law, would expo&s;e all mayors, bailiffs, and returning-officers, to a multiplicity of vexatious &s;uits, and in&s;upportable expences, and &s;ubject them to different and independent juri&s;dictions, as well as to incon&s;i&s;tent determinations in the &s;ame ca&s;e, without relief: That Matthew A&s;hby was guilty of a breach of privilege, as were all attornies, &s;ollicitors, coun&s;ellors, and &s;erjeants at law, &s;olli$iting, pro|&s;ecuting, or pleading, in any ca&s;e of the &s;ame nature. The&s;e re&s;olutions, &s;igned by the clerk, were fixed upon the gate of We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. On the other hand, the lords appointed a committee to draw up a &s;tate of the ca&s;e; and, upon their report, re&s;olved, That every per&s;on being wilfully hindered to exer|ci&s;e his right of voting, might maintain an action in the queen's courts again&s;t the officer by whom his vote &s;hould be refu&s;ed, to a&s;&s;ert his right, and recover damage for the injury: That an a&s;&s;ertion to the contrary was de&s;tructive of the property of the &s;ubjects, again&s;t the freedom of elections, and manife&s;tly tended to the encouragement of partiality and corruption: That the declaring Matthew A&s;hby guilty of a breach of privilege of the hou&s;e of commons, was an un|precedented attempt upon the judicature of parliament, and an attempt to &s;ub|ject the law of England to the votes of the hou&s;e of commons. Copies of the ca&s;e, and the&s;e re&s;olutions, were by the lord keeper &s;ent to all the &s;heriffs of Eng|land, to be circulated through all the boroughs of their re&s;pective counties.</P>

<P>On the &s;eventh day of February the queen ordered &s;ecretary Hedges to tell the hou&s;e of commons, that &s;he had remitted the arrears of the tenths to the poor clergy: that &s;he would grant her whole revenue ari&s;ing out of the fir&s;t|fruits and tenths, as far as it &s;hould become free from incumbrance, as an aug|mentation of their maintenance: and, that if the hou&s;e of commons could find any method by which her intentions to the poor clergy might be made more effectual, it would be an advantage to the public, and acceptable to her maje&s;ty. The commons immediately brought in a bill, enabling her to alienate this branch of the revenue, and create a corporation by charter, to direct the ap|plication of it to the u&s;es propo&s;ed: they likewi&s;e repealed the &s;tatute of Mort|main, &s;o far as to allow all men to bequeath by will, or grant by deed, any &s;um they &s;hould think fit to give towards the augmentation of benefices. Addre&s;&s;es of thanks and acknowledgment from all the clergy of England were pre&s;ented to the queen for her gracious bounty; but, very little regard was payed to

<P>In March an inquiry into the condition of the navy was begun in the hou&s;e o$ lords. They de&s;ired the queen, in an addre&s;s, to give &s;peedy and effectual orders, that a number of &s;hips &s;ufficient for the home-&s;ervice &s;hould be equipped and manned with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. They re&s;olved, That admi|ral Graydon's not attacking the four French &s;hips in the channel, had been a pre|judice to the queen's &s;ervice, and a di&s;grace to the nation: That his pre&s;&s;ing men in Jamaica, and his &s;everity towards ma&s;ters of merchant ve&s;&s;els and tran&s;ports, had been a great di&s;couragement to the inhabitants of that i&s;land, as well as prejudi|cial to her maje&s;ty's &s;ervice: and, they pre&s;ented the addre&s;s again&s;t him, in con|&s;equence of which he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. They examined the accounts of the earl of Orford, again&s;t which great clamour had been rai&s;ed; and, taking cognizance of the remarks made by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the public accounts, found them fal&s;e in fact, ill grounded, or of no importance. The commons be&s;ought the queen to order a pro&s;ecution on account of ill practices in the earl of Rane|lagh's office; and, they &s;ent up to the lords a bill for continuing the commi&s;&s;ion on the public accounts. Some alterations were made in the upper hou&s;e, e&s;pe|cially, in the nomination of commi&s;&s;ioners; but, the&s;e were rejected by the commons. The peers adhering to their admendments, the bill dropped and the commi&s;&s;ion expired. No other bill of any con&s;equence pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, except an act for rai&s;ing recruits, which impowered ju&s;tices of the peace to im|pre&s;s idle per&s;ons for &s;oldiers and marines. On the third day of April the queen went to the hou&s;e of peers, and having made a &s;hort &s;peech on the u&s;ual topics of acknowledgment, unity, and moderation, prorogued the parliament to the fourth day of July. The divi&s;ion &s;till continued between the two hou&s;es of con|vocation; &s;o that nothing of moment was tran&s;acted in that a&s;&s;embly, except their addre&s;s to the queen upon her granting the fir&s;t-fruits and tenths for the augmentation of &s;mall benefices. At the &s;ame time, the lower hou&s;e &s;ent their prolocutor with a deputation to wait upon the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons, to return their thanks to that honourable hou&s;e for having e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;t of the clergy; and, a promi&s;e to pur&s;ue &s;uch methods as might be&s;t conduce to the &s;upport, honour, intere&s;t, and &s;ecurity of the church as now by law e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. They &s;ent up to the archbi&s;hop and prelates divers repre&s;entations, containing complaints, and propo&s;ing canons and articles of reformation; but, very little regard was payed to their r$mon&s;t$$n$e$.</P>

<P>About this period, the earl of Nottingham, after having ineffectually pre&s;&s;ed the queen to d$&s;card the dukes of Someriet and Devon&s;hire, re&s;igned the &s;eals. The earl of Jer&s;ey and Sir Edward Seymour were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: the earl of Kent was appointed chamberlain, Harley &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and Henry St. John &s;ecretary of war. The di&s;covery of the Scotti&s;h con&s;piracy was no &s;ooner known in France, than Lewis ordered Fra&s;er to be impri&s;oned in the Ba&s;tile. In England Lind&s;ay being &s;entenced to die for having corre&s;ponded with France, was given to under&s;tand that he had no m$rcy to expect unle&s;s he would di&s;|cover the con&s;piracy. He per&s;i&s;ted in denying all knowledge of any &s;uch con&s;piracy; and, &s;corned to &s;ave his life by giving fal&s;e information. In order to intim$date him into a confe&s;&s;ion, the mini&s;try ordered him to be conveyed to
<PB N="281" REF="2840">
Tyburn, where he &s;till rejected life upon the terms propo&s;ed: then he was car|ried back to Newgate, where he remained &s;ome years: at length, he was ba|ni&s;hed, and died of hunger in Holland. The mini&s;ters had been &s;o lukewarm and languid in the inve&s;tigation of the Scotti&s;h con&s;piracy, that the Whigs loudly exclaimed again&s;t them as di&s;gui&s;ed Jacobites, and even whi&s;pered in&s;inu|ations, implying, that the queen her&s;elf had a &s;ecret bia&s;s of &s;i&s;terly affection for the court of St. Germain's. What &s;eemed to confirm this allegation, was the di&s;grace of the duke of Queensberry, who had exerted him&s;elf with remark|able zeal in the detection; but, the decline of his intere&s;t in Scotland was the real cau&s;e of his being layed a&s;ide at this juncture.</P>

<P>The de&s;ign of the court was to procure in the Scotti&s;h parliament the nomination of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown, and a &s;upply for the forces, which could not be obtained in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion. Secretary John&s;ton, in concert with the marquis of Tweedale, undertook to carry the&s;e points, in return for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Hi&s;t. of Q. Anne. Feuquieres. Lockhart. Burchet. Tindal.

The marquis was appointed commi&s;&s;ioner. The office of lord-regi&s;ter was be&s;towed upon John&s;ton; and, the parliament met on the &s;ixth day of July. The queen, in her letter, expre&s;&s;ed her concern that the&s;e divi&s;ions &s;hould have ri&s;en to &s;uch a height, as to encourage the enemies of the nation to employ their emi&s;&s;aries for debauching her good &s;ubjects from their allegiance. She declared her re&s;olution to grant whatever could in rea&s;on be demanded for quieting the minds of the people. She told them, &s;he had impowered the marquis of Tweedale to give unque&s;tionable proofs of her determination to maintain the government in church and &s;tate as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed in that kingdom; to con&s;ent to &s;uch laws as &s;hould be found wanting for the further &s;ecurity of both, and for preventing all incroachments for the future. She earne&s;tly exhorted them to &s;ettle the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant line, as a &s;tep ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their own peace<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1704.</NOTE> and happine&s;s, the quiet and &s;ecurity of all her dominions, the reputation of her affairs abroad, and the improvement of the prote&s;tant intere&s;t through all Europe. She declared, that &s;he had authorized the commi&s;&s;ioner to give the royal a&s;&s;ent to whatever could be rea&s;onably demanded, and was in her power to grant, for &s;ecuring the &s;overeignty and liberties of that her antient kingdom. The remaining part of the letter turned upon the nece&s;&s;ity of their granting a &s;upply, the di&s;couragement of vice, the encouragement of commerce, and the u&s;ual recommendation of moderation and unanimity.</P>

<P>The duke of Hamilton pre&s;ented a re&s;olve, That the parliament would not name a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown, until the Scots &s;hould have concluded a pre|vious treaty with England, in relation to commerce and other concerns. This motion produced a warm debate, in the cour&s;e of which, Fletcher of Salton expatiated upon the hard&s;hips and mi&s;eries which the Scots had &s;u&s;tained &s;ince the union of the two crowns under one &s;overeign, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of bet|tering their condition, unle&s;s they &s;hould take care to anticipate any de&s;ign that tended to a continuation of the &s;ame calamities. Another re&s;olve was produced by the earl of Rothes, importing, That the parliament &s;hould proceed to make &s;uch limitations and conditions of government as might be judged proper for rectifying the con&s;titu$$$n; for vindicating and &s;ecuring the &s;overeignty and independency of the n$tion; and, then the parliament would take into con&s;ide|ration the other re&s;olve offered by the duke of Hamilton for a treaty previous to the nomination of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This propo&s;al was &s;econded by the court-party;
<PB N="282" REF="2850">
and, violent heats en&s;ued. At length, Sir James Falconer of Phe&s;do, offered an expedient, which neither party could refu&s;e with any &s;hew of moderation. He &s;ugge&s;ted a re&s;olve, That the parliament would not proceed to the nomina|tion of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, until the previous treaty with England &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; and, that it would make the nece&s;&s;ary limitations and conditions of govern|ment, before the &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould be nominated. This joint-re&s;olve being put to the vote, was carried by a great majority. The treaty with England was neglected, and the affair of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion con&s;equently po&s;tponed. The duke of Athol moved, That her maje&s;ty &s;hould be de&s;ired to &s;end down the witne&s;&s;es and all the papers relating to the con&s;piracy, that after due examination tho&s;e who were unju&s;tly accu&s;ed might be vindicated, and the guilty puni&s;hed accord|ing to their demerits. The commi&s;&s;ioner declared, that he had already written, and would write again to the queen on that &s;ubject. The intention of the cava|lie$s was to convict the duke of Queen&s;berry of malice and calumny in the pro|&s;ecution of that affair, that they might wreak their vengeance upon him for that in&s;tance of his animo&s;ity, as well as for his having de&s;erted them in the former &s;e&s;&s;ion But, he found means to per&s;uade the queen, that &s;uch an inquiry would not only protract the &s;e&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o divert them from the &s;ettlement of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, and rai&s;e &s;uch a $erment as might be productive of tragical con&s;e|quences. Alarmed at the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, &s;he re&s;olved to prevent the examina|tion; and, made no an&s;wer to the repeated applications made by her parliament and mini&s;ters. Mean while, the duke of Queen&s;berry appea&s;ed his enemies in Scotland, by directing all his friends to join in the oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>The duke of Hamilton again moved, That the parliament &s;hould proc$ed to the limitations, and name commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with England, previous to all other bu&s;ine&s;s, except an act for a land-tax of two months, nece&s;&s;ary for the immediate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the forces. The earl of March|mo$t propo&s;ed an act to exclude all popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; but, this was warmly oppo&s;ed as un&s;ea&s;onable, by Hamilton and his party. A bill of &s;upply being offered by the lord-ju&s;tice clerk, the cavaliers tacked to it great part of the act of &s;ecurity, to which the royal a&s;&s;ent had been refu&s;ed in the former &s;e&s;&s;ion. Violent debates aro&s;e; &s;o that the hou&s;e was filled with rage and tumuit. The national &s;pirit of independence had been wrought up to a dan|gerous pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;m. The &s;treets were crowded with people of all ranks, excla$m$ng again&s;t Engli&s;h influence; and, threatening to &s;acrifice as traitors to their country, all who &s;hould embrace mea&s;ures that &s;eemed to favour a foreign intere&s;t. The commi&s;&s;ioner and his friends were confounded and appalled. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tem the torre$t, he, with the concurrence of the other min$&s;ters, wrote a letter to the queen, repre&s;enting the uncomfortable &s;ituation of affairs, and advi&s;ing her maje&s;ty to pa&s;s the bill, incumbered as it was with the act of &s;ecurity. Lord Godolphin, on who&s;e coun&s;el &s;he chiefly relied, found him&s;elf involved in great perp$ex$ty. The Tories had devoted him to de&s;truction. He forefaw that the queen's conce$$ion to the Scots in an affair of &s;uch con&s;quence, would furni&s;h his enemies with a plau&s;ible pretence to arraign the conduct of her mini&s;ter; but, he cho&s;e to run that ri&s;que rather than &s;ee the army di&s;banded for want of a &s;upply, and the kingdom left expo&s;ed to an inva&s;ion. He there|fore &s;econded the advice of the Scotti&s;h mini&s;ters; and, the queen authori&s;ed the commi&s;&s;ioner to pa&s;s the bill that was depending. This act provided, That in ca&s;e of the queen's dying without i$$ue, a parliament &s;hould immediately
<PB N="283" REF="2860">
meet and declare the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the cro$n, different from the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the throne of England, unle&s;s before that period a &s;ettlement &s;hould be made in parliament, of the rights and liberties of the nation, independent on Engli&s;h councils: by another clau&s;e, they were impowered to arm and train the &s;ubjects &s;o as to put them in a po&s;ture of defence. The Scotti&s;h parliament, having by a laudable exertion of &s;pirit obtained this act of &s;ecurity, granted the &s;upply with|out further he&s;itation; but, not yet &s;atisfied with this &s;acrifice, they engaged in debates about the con&s;piracy, and the proceedings of the hou&s;e of lords in Eng|land, which they termed an officious intermeddling in their concerns, and an incroachment upon the &s;overeignty and independency of the nation. They drew up an addre&s;s to the queen, de&s;iring, that the evidence and papers relating to the plot, might be &s;ubjected to their examination in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion. Mean while, the commi&s;&s;ioner dreading the further progre&s;s of &s;uch an ungovernable ferocity, prorogued the parliament to the &s;eventh day of October. The act of &s;ecurity being tran&s;mitted to England, copies of it were circulated by the ene|mies of Godolphin, who repre&s;ented it as a mea&s;ure of that mini&s;ter; and, the kingdom was filled with murmurs and di&s;content. People openly declared, that the two kingdoms were now &s;eparated by law, &s;o as never to be rejoined. Re|ports were &s;pread, that great quantities of arms had been conveyed to Scotland$ and, that the natives were employed in preparations to invade England. All the blame of the&s;e tran&s;actions was imputed to lord Godolphin, whom the Tories determined to attack, while the other party re&s;olved to exert their whole influence for his pre&s;ervation: yet, in all probability, he owed his immediate &s;up|port to the &s;ucce&s;s of his friend the duke of Marlborough.</P>

<P>Nothing could be more deplorable than the &s;ituation to which the emperor was reduced in the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on. The malcontents in Hun|gary had rendered them&s;elves formidable by their &s;ucce&s;s: the elector of Bava|ria po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the places on the Danube as far as Pa&s;&s;au, and even threatened the city of Vienna, which mu&s;t have been infallibly lo&s;t had the Hungarians and Bavarians acted in concert. By the advice of prince Eugene, the emperor im|plored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her Britannic maje&s;ty; and, the duke of Marlborough explained to her the nece&s;&s;ity of undertaking his relief. This nobleman in the month of January had cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to Holland, and concerted a &s;cheme with the deputies of the &s;tates-general, for the operations of the en&s;uing campaign. They agreed, that general Overkirk &s;hould lie upon the defen&s;ive with a &s;mall body of troops in the Netherlands, while the main army of the allies &s;hould act upon the Rhine, under the command of the duke of Marlborough. Such was the pretext under which this con&s;ummate general concealed another plan, which was communicated to a few only, in who&s;e di&s;cretion he could confide. It was approved by the pen&s;ionary and &s;ome leading men, who &s;ecured its fa|vourable reception with the &s;tates-general, when it became nece&s;&s;ary to impart the &s;ecret to that numerous a&s;&s;embly. In the mean time, the preparations were made, on pretence of carrying the war to the banks of the Mo&s;elle.</P>

<P>In the month of April, the duke, accompanied by his brother general Churchill, lieutenant-general Lumley, the earl of Orkney, and other officers of di&s;tinction, embarked for Holland, where he had a long conference with a de|putation of the &s;tates, concerning a propo&s;al of &s;ending a large army towards the Mo&s;elle. The deputies of Zealand oppo&s;ed this mea&s;ure of &s;ending their
<PB N="284" REF="2870">
troops to &s;uch a di&s;tance, &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly, that the duke was obliged to tell them in plain terms, he had received orders to march thither with the Briti&s;h forces. He accordingly a&s;&s;embled his army at Ma$&s;tricht; and, on the eighth day of May began his march into Germany. The French imagined his intention was to begin the campaign with the &s;iege of Traerbach, and penetrate into France along the Mo&s;elle. In this per&s;ua&s;ion they &s;ent a detachment to that river; and gave out that they intended to inve&s;t Huy, a pretence to which the duke payed no regard. He continued his route by Bedburg, Kerpenord, Kal&s;ecken, and vi&s;ited the fortifications of Bonne, where he received certain advice, that the recruits and reinforcements for the French army in Bavaria had joined the elector at Villingen. He redoubled his diligence, pa&s;&s;ed the Neckar on the third of June, and halted at Ladenburgh, from whence he wrote a letter to the &s;tates-general, giving them to under&s;tand, that he had the queen's orders to march to the relief of the empire; and, expre&s;&s;ing his hope, that they would approve the de&s;ign, and allow their troops to &s;hare the honour of the expedition. By the return of a courier he received their approbation, and full power to com|mand their forces. He then proceeded to Mildenheim, where he was vi&s;ited by pr$nce Eugene; and, the&s;e two great men, who&s;e talents were congenial, im|mediately contracted an intimacy of friend&s;hip. Next day prince Lewis of Baden arrived in the camp at Great Hippach. He told the duke, his grace was come to &s;ave the empire, and to give him an opportunity of vindicating his honour, which he knew was at the la&s;t &s;take in the opinion of &s;ome people. The duke replied, he was come to learn of him how to &s;erve the empire: that they mu&s;t be ignorant indeed, who did not know, that the prince of Baden, when his health permitted him, had pre&s;erved the empire and extended its conque&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XV.</HEAD>
<P>Tho&s;e three celebrated generals agreed, that the two armies &s;hould join: that the command &s;hould be alternately ve&s;ted in the duke and prince Lewis, from day to day: and, that prince Eugene &s;hould command a &s;eparate army on the Rhine. Prince Lewis returned to his army on the Danube: prince Eugene &s;et out for Philipsburg: and, the duke of Marlborough being joined by the Imperial army under prince Lewis of Baden, at Wa&s;tertellen, pro&s;ecuted his march by Elchingen, Gingen, and Landthau&s;&s;en. On the fir&s;t day of July he was in &s;ight of the enemy's intrenchments at Dillingen, and encamped with his right at Amerdighem, and his left at Onderingen. Under&s;tanding that the elector of Bavaria had detached the be&s;t part of his infantry to reinforce the count D'Arco, who was po&s;ted behind &s;trong lines at Schellenberg near Dona|wert, he re&s;olved to attack their intrenchments without delay. On the &s;econd day of July he advanced towards the enemy, pa&s;&s;ed the river Wermitz; and, about five o'clock in the afternoon the attack was begun by the Engli&s;h and Dutch infantry, &s;upported by the hor&s;e and dragoons. They were very &s;everely handled, and even obliged to give way, when prince Lewis of Baden marching up at the head of the Imperiali&s;ts, to another part of the line, made a diver&s;ion in their favour. After an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance they forced the intrenchments, and the hor&s;e entering with the infantry, fell &s;o furiou&s;ly upon the enemy al|ready di&s;ordered, that they were routed with great &s;laughter. They fled with the utmo&s;t trepidation to Donawert and the Danube, leaving &s;ix thou&s;and men dead on the field of battle. The confederates took &s;ixteen pieces of cannon,
<PB N="285" REF="2880">
thirteen pair of colours, with all the tents and baggage. Yet, the victory was dearly purcha&s;ed: &s;ome thou&s;ands of the allies were &s;lain in the attack, includ|ing many gallant officers, among whom were the generals Goor and Beinheim, and count Stirum was mortally wounded. Next day the Bavarian garri&s;on abandoned Donawert, of which the confederates took immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; while the elector pa&s;&s;ed the Danube in his march to the river Leche, le$t the victors &s;hould cut off his retreat to his own country. The confederates having cro&s;&s;ed the Danube on &s;everal bridges of pontons, a detachment was &s;ent to pa&s;s the Leche, and take po&s;t in the country of the elector, who had retired under the cannon of Aug&s;burg. The garri&s;on of Neuburg retiring to Ingol&s;tadt, the place was &s;ecured by the confederates; and, the count de Frize was detached with nine battalions and fifteen &s;quadrons to inve&s;t the town of Rain. Advice arriving from prince Eugene, that the marechals Villeroy and Tallard had pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Fort Kehl, with an army of five and forty thou&s;and men, to &s;uc|cour the elector of Bavaria, the generals of the allies immediately detached prince Maximilian of Hanover with thirty &s;quadrons of hor&s;e, as a reinforce|ment to the prince. In a few days Rain &s;urrendered$ and Aicha was taken by a&s;&s;ault. The emperor no &s;ooner received a confirmation of the victory of Schellenbergh, than he wrote a letter of acknowledgment to the duke of Marl|borough; and, ordered count Wrati&s;lau to intimate his intention of inve&s;ting him with the title of prince of the empire, which the duke declined accepting, until the queen interpo&s;ed her authority at the de&s;ire of Leopold.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XVI.</HEAD>
<P>The allies advanced within a league of Augsburg, and tho' they found the elector of Bavaria too &s;ecurely po&s;ted under the cannon of that city, to be di&s;|lodged or attacked with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, they encamped with Fried|burg in their centre, &s;o as to cut off all communication between him and his dominions. The duke of Marlborough having reduced him to this &s;ituation, propo&s;ed very advantageous terms of peace, provided he would abandon the French intere&s;t and join the Imperiali&s;ts in Italy. His &s;ubjects &s;eeing them|&s;elves at the mercy of the allies, pre&s;&s;ed him to comply with tho&s;e offers, rather than expo&s;e his country to ruin and de&s;olation. A negotiation was begun, and he &s;eemed ready to &s;ign the articles, when hearing that marechal Tallard had pa&s;&s;ed the Black-fore&s;t to join him with a great body of forces, he declared, that &s;ince the king of France had made &s;uch powerful efforts to &s;upport him, he thought him&s;elf obliged in honour to continue firm in his alliance. The generals of the allies were &s;o exa&s;perated at this di&s;appointment, that they &s;ent out detachments to ravage the country of Bavaria as far as Munich; and, up|wards of three hundred towns, villages, and ca&s;tles, were inhumanly de&s;troyed, to the indelible di&s;grace of tho&s;e who countenanced and conducted &s;uch barba|rous practices. The elector, &s;hocked at the&s;e brutal proceedings, de&s;ired, in a letter to the duke of Marlborough, that a &s;top might be put to acts of violence &s;o oppo&s;ite to true glory. The an&s;wer he received, implied, that it was in his own power to put an end to them by a &s;peedy accommodation. Incen&s;ed at this reply, he declared, that &s;ince they had obliged him to draw the &s;word, he would throw away the &s;cabbard. The duke and prince Lewis finding it imprac|ticable to attack the elector in his &s;trong camp, re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege of Ingol&s;tadt; and, for that purpo&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the Paer near the town of Schrob|benhau&s;en, where they encamped with their left at Clo&s;terberg. On the fifth
<PB N="286" REF="2890">
day of Augu&s;t the elector of Bavaria marched to Biberach, where he was joined by Tallard. He re&s;olved to pa&s;s the Danube at Lawingen, to attack prince Eugene, who had followed the French army from the lines of Biehl, and lay encamped at Hoch&s;tadt. Next day, however, he made a motion that di&s;ap|pointed the enemy. Neverthele&s;s, they per&s;i&s;ted in their de&s;ign of pa&s;&s;ing the Danube and encamping at Blenheim. The allies re&s;olved, that prince Lewis &s;hould undertake the &s;iege of Ingold&s;tadt, whil&s;t prince Eugene and the duke &s;hould ob&s;erve the elector of Bavaria. Advice being received that he had actu|ally cro&s;&s;ed the Danube at Lawingen, the duke of Marlborough joined the forces of prince Eugene at the camp of Mun&s;ter on the eleventh day of Augu&s;t, prince Lewis having by this time marched off towards the place he in|tended to be&s;iege. Next day the duke of Marlborough and prince Eugene ob|&s;erved the po&s;ture of the enemy, who were advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted on a hill near Hoch&s;tadt, their right being covered by the Danube and the village of Blen|heim, their left by the village of Lutzengen, and their front by a rivulet, the banks of which were &s;teep and the bottom mar&s;hy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XVII.</HEAD>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e difficulties, the generals re&s;olved to attack them immediately, rather than he inactive until their forage and provi&s;ion &s;hould be con&s;umed. They were morever &s;timulated to this hazardous enter|prize, by an intercepted letter to the elector of Bavaria from marechal Villeroy, giving him to under&s;tand, that he had received orders to ravage the country of Wirtemberg, and intercept all communication between the Rhine and the allied army. The di&s;po&s;itions being made for the attack, and the orders communi|cated to the general officers, the forces advanced into the plain on the thirteenth day of Augu&s;t, and were ranged in order of battle. The cannonading began about nine in the morning, and continued on both &s;ides till one in the after|noon. The French and Bavarians amounted to about &s;ixty thou&s;and men$ Marechal Tallard commanded on the right, and po&s;ted &s;even and twenty bat|talions with twelve &s;quadrons in the village of Blenheim, &s;uppo&s;ing that there the allies would make their chief effort: their left was conducted by the elector of Bavaria, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mar&s;in, a French general of experience and capacity. The number of the confederates did not exceed five and fifty: their right was under the direction of prince Eugene, and their left commanded by the duke of Marlborough. At noon the action was begun by a body of Engli&s;h and He&s;&s;ians, under major-general Wilkes, who having pa&s;&s;ed the rivulet with difficulty, and filed off to the left in the face of the enemy, attacked the village of Blenheim with great vigour; but, were repul&s;ed after three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive attempts. Mean while, the troops in the center and part of the right wing, pa&s;&s;ed the rivu|let on planks in different places; and, formed on the other &s;ide without any mole&s;tation from the enemy. At length, however, they were charged by the French hor&s;e with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, and &s;o terribly galled in flank by the troops po&s;ted at Blenheim, that they fell in di&s;order, and part of them repa&s;&s;ed the rivulet; but, a reinforcement of dragoons coming up, the French cavalry were broke in their turn, and driven to the very hedges of the village of Blenheim. The left wing of the confederates being now completely formed, a&s;cended the hill in a firm compacted body, charging the enemy's hor&s;e, which could no longer &s;tand their ground; but, rallied &s;everal times as they gave way. Tal|lard, in order to make a vigorous effort, ordered ten battalions to fill up the in|tervals
<PB N="287" REF="2900">
of his cavalry. The duke perceiving his de&s;ign, &s;ent three battalions of the troops of Zell to &s;u&s;tain his hor&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, the line was a little di&s;|ordered by the prodigious fire from the French infantry, and even obliged to re|coil about &s;ixty paces; but, the confederates advancing to the charge with re|doubled ardour, routed the French hor&s;e; and their battalions being thus aban|doned, were cut in pieces. Tallard, having rallied his broken cavalry behind &s;ome tents that were &s;till &s;tanding, re&s;olved to draw off the troops he had po&s;ted in the village of Blenheim, and &s;ent an aid-du-camp to Mar&s;in, who was with the elector of Bavaria on the left, to de&s;ire he would face the confederates with &s;ome troops to the right of the village of Oberklau, &s;o as to keep them in play, and favour the retreat of the forces from Blenheim. That officer a&s;&s;ured him, he was &s;o far from being in a condition to &s;pare troops, that he could hardly maintain his ground. The fate of the day was now more than half decided. The French cavalry being vigorou&s;ly attacked in flank were totally defeated. Part of them endeavoured to gain the bridge which they had thrown over the Danube between Hoch&s;tadt and Blenheim; but, they were &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, that tho&s;e who e&s;caped the &s;laughter threw them&s;elves into the river, where they peri&s;hed. Tallard, being &s;urrounded, was taken near a mill behind the village of Sonderen, together with the marquis de Montperoux general of hor&s;e, the major-generals de Seppeville, de Silly, de la Valiere, and many other officers of di&s;tinction. Whil&s;t the&s;e occurrences pa&s;&s;ed on the left wing, Mar&s;in's quarters at the village of Oberklau, in the centre, were attacked by ten battalions, under the prince of Hol&s;tein-beck, who pa&s;&s;ed the rivulet with undaunted re&s;olution; but, before he could form his men on the other &s;ide, he was overpowered by numbers, mortally wounded and taken pri&s;oner. His battalions being &s;up|ported by &s;ome Dani&s;h and Hanoverian cavalry, renewed the charge, and were again repul&s;ed: at length, the duke of Marlborough in per&s;on brought up &s;ome fre&s;h &s;quadrons from the body of re&s;erve, and obliged the enemy to retire. By this time, prince Eugene had obliged the left wing of the enemy to give ground, after having &s;urmounted a great number of difficulties, &s;u&s;tained a very ob&s;ti|nate oppo&s;ition, and &s;een his cavalry, in which his chief &s;trength &s;eemed to lie, three times repul&s;ed. The duke of Marlborough had no &s;ooner defeated the right wing, than he made a di&s;po&s;ition to reinforce the prince, when he un|der&s;tood from an aid-du-camp, that his highne&s;s had no occa&s;ion for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, that the elector with mon&s;ieur de Mar&s;in had abandoned Oberklau and Lutzingen. They were pur&s;ued as far as the villages of Mor&s;elingen and Tei&s;|&s;enhoven, from whence they retreated to Dillingen and Lawingen. The con|federates were now ma&s;ters of the field of battle, and &s;urrounded the village of Blenheim, in which, as we have already ob&s;erved, &s;even and twenty battalions and twelve &s;quadrons were po&s;ted. Seeing them&s;elves cut off from all com|munication with the re&s;t of their army, and de&s;pairing of being able to force their way through the allies, they capitulated about eight in the evening, layed down their arms, delivered their colours and &s;tandards, and &s;urren|dered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, on condition, that the officers &s;hould not be rifled. This was one of the mo&s;t glorious and complete victories that ever was obtained. Ten thou&s;and French and Bavarians were left dead on the $ield of battle: the greater part of thirty &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons peri&s;hed in the river Danube: thirteen thou&s;and were made pri&s;oners: one hundred
<PB N="288" REF="2910">
pieces of cannon were taken, with twenty-four mortars, one hundred and twenty-nine colours, one hundred and &s;eventy-one &s;tandards, &s;eventeen pair of kettle drums, three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred tents, four and thirty coaches, three hundred laden mules, two bridges of boats, fifteen pontoons, fifteen barrels and eight ca&s;ks filled with &s;ilver. Of the allies, about four thou&s;and five hun|dred men were killed, and about eight thou&s;and wounded or taken. The lo&s;s of the battle was imputed to two capital errors committed by marechal Tallard; namely, his weakening the centre, by detaching &s;uch a number of troops to the village of Blenheim, and his &s;uffering the confederates to pa&s;s the rivulet, and form unmole&s;ted. Certain it is, the&s;e circum&s;tances contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of the duke of Marlborough, who rode through the hotte&s;t of the fire with the calme&s;t intrepidity, giving his orders with that pre&s;ence of mind and deliberation which were &s;o peculiar to his character. When he next day vi&s;ited Tallard, he told that general, he was &s;orry &s;uch a misfortune &s;hould happen per&s;onally on one for whom he had a profound e&s;teem. The marechal congratulated him on having vanqui&s;hed the be&s;t troops in the world; a com|pliment to which the duke replied, That he thought his own the be&s;t troops in the world, &s;eeing they had conquered tho&s;e upon whom the marechal had be&s;towed &s;uch an encomium.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The victorious generals having by this deci&s;ive &s;troke &s;aved the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria from ruin, and intirely changed the face of affairs in the $mpire, &s;ignified their opinion to prince Lewis of Baden, that it would be for the advantage of the common cau&s;e to join all their forces and drive the French out of Germany, rather than lo&s;e time at the &s;iege of Ingold&s;tadt, which would &s;urrender of cour&s;e. This opinion was confirmed by the conduct of the French garri&s;on at Aug&s;burg, who quitted that place on the &s;ixteenth day of Augu&s;t. The magi&s;trates &s;ent a deputation, craving the protection of the duke of Marlborough, who forthwith ordered a detachment to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that important city. The duke having &s;ent marechal de Tallard under a guard of dragoons to Frankfort, and di&s;po&s;ed of the other pri&s;oners of di&s;|tinction in the adjacent places, encamped at Sefillingen, within half a league of Ulm. Here he held a conference with the princes Eugene and Lewis of Baden, in which they agreed, that, as the enemy retreated towards the Rhine, the confederate army &s;hould take the &s;ame route, excepting three and twenty battalions and &s;ome &s;quadrons, to be left for the &s;iege of Ulm, under general Thungen. They began their march on the twenty &s;ixth day of Augu&s;t, by dif|ferent routes, to the general rendezvous at Bru&s;chal, near Philip&s;burg. Then they re&s;olved, that pr$nce Lewis of Baden &s;hould undertake the &s;iege of Lan|dau, in order to &s;ecure the circle of Suabia from the incur&s;ions of that garri&s;on. Con&s;idering the con$$$rnation that prevailed all over France, nothing could be more impolitic than this mea&s;ure, which gave the enemy time for recollection, and recruiting their forces. It was a propo&s;al on which the prince of Baden in&s;i&s;ted with uncommon ob&s;tinacy. He was even &s;u&s;pected of corruption. He was jealous of the glory which the duke of Marlborough had acquired; and &s;uch a bigotted paput that he repined at the &s;ucce&s;s of an heretical general. On the twelfth day of September, he marched towards Landau with the troops de&s;tined for the &s;iege, and the duke of Marlborough with prince Eugene en|camped at Croon Wei&s;&s;enburg, to cover the enterprize. By this time Ulm
<PB N="289" REF="2920">
had &s;urrendered to Thungen, even before the trenches were opened. Villeroy advanced with his army towards Landau, as if he had intended to attack the confederates; but he retired without having made any attempt for the relief the place, which was defended with the mo&s;t ob$tinate valour till the twenty-third day of November, when the be&s;iegers having lodged them&s;elves on the coun|ter&s;carps, the breaches being practicable, and the di&s;po&s;itions made for a ge|neral a&s;&s;ault, the garri&s;on capitulated upon honourable conditions. The king of the Romans had arrived in the camp, that he might have the credit of taking the place, the command of which he be&s;towed on the count de Frize, who had before defended it with equal courage and ability.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XIX.</HEAD>
<P>The next enterprize which the confederates undertook, was the &s;iege of Traerbach. The hereditary prince of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el being intru&s;ted with the direction of the attacks, inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle in the beginning of No|vember; and, though it was &s;trongly fortified and well defended, carried on his operations with &s;uch &s;pirit and a&s;&s;iduity, that in about &s;ix weeks the garri&s;on &s;urrendered the place on honourable terms. In the mean time, the duke of Marlborough repaired to Berlin, where he negotiated for a rein|forcement of eight thou&s;and Pru&s;&s;ians to &s;erve under prince Eugene in Italy, during the next campaign. Thence he proceeded to the court of Hanover, where, as in all other places, he was received with particular marks of di&s;|tinction. When he arrived at the Hague, he was congratulated by the &s;tates-general on his victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim, and as much con&s;idered in Holland as if he had been actually &s;tadtholder. He had received a &s;econd letter from the emperor, couched in the warme&s;t terms of acknowledgment, and was declared prince of the empire. In December he embarked for Eng|land, where he found the people in a tran&s;port of joy, and was welcomed as an hero who had retrieved the glory of the nation.</P>

<P>In Flanders, nothing of moment was executed, except the bombard|ment of Bruges and Namur by baron Spaar, with nine thou&s;and Dutch troops; and two attempts upon the French lines, which were actually penetrated by Overkirk, though he was not able to maintain the footing he had gained. The elector of Bavaria, who had retired to Bru&s;&s;els after his defeat, formed a &s;cheme for &s;urpri&s;ing the Dutch general at the end of the campaign, and a&s;|&s;embled all his troops at Tirlemont; but the French court, apprehen&s;ive of his temerity, &s;ent Villeroy to watch his conduct, and prevent his hazarding an engagement, except with a fair pro&s;pect of advantage. The marechal finding him determined to give battle at all events, repre&s;ented the improbability of &s;ucceeding again&s;t an enemy &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted; and the ill con&s;equences of a repul&s;e: but finding the elector deaf to all his remon&s;trances, he flatly re|fu&s;ed to march, and produced the king's order to avoid an engagement. In Italy the French met with no oppo&s;ition. The duke of Savoy being unable to face the enemy in the field, was obliged to lie inactive, and &s;ee the duke of Vendome reduce Vercelli and Ivrea, and undertake the &s;iege of Verac, while he po&s;ted his little army on the other &s;ide of the Po, at Cre&s;centi$o, where he had a bridge of communication, by which he &s;upplied the place occa&s;ionally with fre&s;h troops and provi&s;ion. It held out five months, again&s;t all the efforts of the French general: at length the communication being cut off, the duke of Savoy retired to Chivas. He bore his misfortunes with great equanimity;

and told the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, that though he was abandoned by the allies, he would never abandon him&s;elf. The emperor had neglected Italy, that he might act with more vigour again&s;t Ragot&s;ki and the Hungarian malcontents, over whom he obtained &s;everal advantages; notwith&s;tanding which they con|tinued formidable, from their number, bravery, and re&s;olution. The mini|&s;ters of the allies pre&s;&s;ed Leopold to enter into a negotiation for a peace with tho&s;e rebels, and conferences were opened: but he was not &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to an accommodation, and Ragot&s;ki aimed at the principality of Tran&s;ylvania, which the court of Vienna would not ea&s;ily relinqui&s;h. The emperor was not a little alarmed by a revolution at the Ottoman Porte, until the new &s;ultan di&s;patched a chiaus to Vienna, with an a&s;&s;urance that he would give no a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to the malcontents of Hungary. In Poland, the diet being a&s;&s;embled by the cardinal-primate, Stani&s;laus Lezin&s;ki, palatine of Po&s;nania, was elected and proclaimed king, and recognized by Charles of Sweden, who &s;till main|tained his army by contributions in that country, more intent upon the ruin of Augu&s;tus than upon the pre&s;ervation of his own dominions; for he payed no regard to the progre&s;s of the Mu&s;covites, who had ravaged Livonia, reduced Narva, and made incur&s;ions into Sweden. Augu&s;tus retreated into his Saxon dominions, which he impoveri&s;hed, in order to rai&s;e a great army, with which he might return to Poland; and the pope e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;t of this new con|vert, &s;o far as to cite the cardinal-primate to appear at Rome, and give an account of the &s;hare he had in the Poli&s;h troubles. The prote&s;tants of the Cevennois deriving courage from de&s;pair, became &s;o trouble&s;ome to the go|vernment of France, that Lewis was obliged to treat them with lenity: he &s;ent marechal Villars again&s;t them with a fre&s;h reinforcement; but at the &s;ame time furni&s;hed him with in&s;tructions to treat for an accommodation. This of|ficer immediately commenced a negotiation with Cavalier, the chief of the re|volters; and a formal treaty was concluded, by which they were indulged with liberty of con&s;cience. But the&s;e articles were v$ry ill ob&s;erved by the French mini&s;try.</P>

<P>In Portugal the intere&s;t of king Charles wore a very melancholy a&s;pect. When he arrived at Li&s;bon, he found no preparations made for open|ing the campaign. The Portugue&s;e mini&s;try favoured the French in &s;ecret: the people were aver&s;e to heretics: the duke of Schomberg was on ill terms with Fagel the Dutch general: the Portugue&s;e forces con&s;i&s;ted of raw un|di&s;ciplined pea&s;ants: and the French amba&s;&s;ador had bought up the be&s;t hor&s;es in the kingdom; &s;o that the troopers could not be properly mounted. The king of Portugal had promi&s;ed to enter Spain with Charles by the middle of May: but he was not ready till the beginning of June, when they reached Santaren. By this time they had publi&s;hed their re&s;pective manife&s;toes; Charles di&s;playing his title to the crown of Spain, and promi&s;ing pardon to all his &s;ub|jects who &s;hould in three months join his army; and the king of Portugal de|claring that his &s;ole aim in taking up arms, was to re&s;tore the liberty of the Spani&s;h nation, oppre&s;&s;ed by the power of France, as well as to a&s;&s;ert the right of Charles to that monarchy. The pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, whom they mentioned by the name of the duke of Anjou, had already anticipated their inva&s;$$n. His general the duke of Berwick entering Portugal, took the town of Segura by &s;tra$agem. The governor of Salva-terra &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion: Cebre|$os
<PB N="291" REF="2940">
was reduced without much oppo&s;ition: Zebredo was abandoned by the in|habitants; and the town of Ihana la Viella was taken by affault. Porrugal was at the &s;ame invaded in different parts by the marquis de Jeoffreville, prince T&s;erclaes de Tilly, and the marquis de Villadarias. Two Dutch battalions were attacked and taken by the duke of Berwick at Sodreira Formo&s;a. Then he pa&s;&s;ed the Tagus and joined prince T&s;erclaes. King Philip arriving in the army, inve&s;ted Portalegre; and the garri&s;on, including an Engli&s;h regiment of foot commanded by colonel Stanhope, were made pri&s;oners of war. The next place he be&s;ieged was Ca&s;tel Davide, which met with the &s;ame fate, although the marquis Das Minas, in order to make a diver&s;ion, entered Spain with fifteen thou&s;and men, took Fuente Grimaldo, in Ca&s;tile, by a&s;&s;ault, defeated a body of French and Spaniards commanded by Don Ronquillo, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Man&s;einto. The weather growing exce&s;&s;ively hot, Philip &s;ent his troops into quarters of refre&s;hment; and the allies followed his example. Duke Schomberg finding his advice very little regarded by the Portugue&s;e mini&s;try, and &s;eeing very little pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, de&s;ired leave to re&s;ign his command, which the queen be&s;towed upon the earl of Galway, who, with a reinforcement of Engli&s;h and Dutch troops, arrived at Li&s;bon on the thirtieth day of July. About the latter end of September, the two kings repaired to the camp near Almeda, re&s;olving to invade Ca&s;tile; but they found the river Agueda &s;o well guarded by the duke of Berwick, that they would not attempt a pa&s;&s;age. They therefore retired into the territories of Portugal, and the army was put into winter-quarters. The Spaniards were now &s;o weakened, by detachments &s;ent with the marquis de Villadarias towards Gibraltar, that the duke of Berwick could not execute any &s;cheme of importance during the remaining part of the campaign.</P>

<P>The arms of England were not le&s;s fortunate by &s;ea than they had been upon the Danube. Sir George Rooke having landed king Charles at Li&s;bon, &s;ent a &s;quadron to crui&s;e off cape Spartell, under the command of rear-admiral Dilkes, who, on the twelfth of March, engaged and took three Spani&s;h &s;hips of war, bound from St. Seba&s;tian's to Cadiz. Rooke received orders from the queen to &s;ail to the relief of Nice and Villa Franca, which were threatened with a &s;iege by the duke of Vendome; and at the &s;ame time he was pre&s;&s;ed by king Charles to execute a &s;cheme upon Barcelona, projected by the prince of He&s;&s;e-D'Arm&s;tadt, who declared his opinion, that the Catalonians would declare for the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, as &s;oon as they &s;hould be a&s;&s;ured of proper &s;upport and protection. The mini&s;try of England under&s;tanding that the French were employed in equipping a &s;trong &s;quadron in Bre&s;t, and judging it was de&s;tined to act in the Mediterranean, &s;ent out Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel with a con&s;iderable fleet, to watch the motions of the Bre&s;t &s;quadron; and he was provided with in&s;tructions how to act in ca&s;e it &s;hould be &s;ailed to the Mediter|ranean. Mean while, Sir George Rooke, in compliance with the intreaties of king Charles, &s;ailed with the tran&s;ports under his convoy to Barcelona, and on the eighteenth of May appeared before the city. Next day, the troops were landed by the prince of He&s;&s;e, to the number of two thou&s;and, and the Dutch ketches bombarded the place: but by this time the governor had &s;ecured the chiefs of the Au&s;trian party; and the people exhibiting no marks of attach|ment to king Charles, the prince reimbarked his &s;oldiers, from an apprehen&s;ion of
<PB N="292" REF="2950">
their being attacked and overpowered by number. On the &s;ixteenth day of June, Sir George Rooke being joined by Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel, re&s;olved to proceed up the Mediterranean in que&s;t of the French fle$t, which had &s;ailed thither from Br$&s;t, and which Rooke had actually d$$covered, in the preceding month, on their voyage to Toulon. On the &s;eventeenth day of July, the admiral called a council of war in the road of Tetuan, when they re|&s;olved to make an attempt upon Gibraltar, whi$h was but $lenderly provided with a garri&s;on. Th$ther they &s;ailed, and on the twenty-fir&s;t day of the month the prince of He&s;&s;e landed on the i&s;thmus with eighteen hundred marines: then he &s;ummoned the governor to &s;urrender, and was an&s;wered, that the place would be defended to the la&s;t extremity. Next day the admiral gave orders for cannonading the town; and perceiving that the enemy were driven from their fortifications at the &s;outh mole-head, commanded captain Whitaker to arm all the boats, and a&s;&s;ault that quarter. The captains Hick and Jumper, who hap|pened to be neare&s;t the mole, immediately manned their pinaces, and entered the forti$$cations &s;word in hand. The Spaniards &s;prung a mine, by which two lieutenants and about a hundred men were killed or wounded. Neverthe|le&s;s, the two captains took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a platform, and kept their ground un|til they were &s;u&s;tained by captain Whitaker and the re&s;t of the &s;eamen, who took by &s;torm a redoubt between the mole and the town. Then the governor capitulated; and the prince of He&s;&s;e entered the place, amazed at the &s;ucce&s;s of this attempt, con&s;idering the &s;trength of the fortifications, which might have been defended by fifty men again&s;t a numerous army.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="23" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>A &s;ufficient garri&s;on being left with his highne&s;s, the admiral re|turned to Tetuan to take in wood and water; and when he &s;ailed, on the ninth day of Augu&s;t, he de&s;cried the French fleet, to which he gave chace with all the &s;ail he could &s;pread. On the thirteenth he came up with it, as it lay in a line off Malaga ready to receive him, to the number of two and fifty great &s;hips, and four and twenty galleys, under the command of the count de Tholou&s;e, high|admiral of France, with the inferior flags of the white and blue divi&s;ions. The Engli&s;h fleet con&s;i&s;ted of three and fifty &s;hips of the line, exclu&s;ive of frigates; but they were inferior to the French in number of guns and men, as well as in weight of metal, and altogether unprovided of gallies, from which the enemy reaped great adv$$tage during the engagement. A little after ten in the morning, the battle began with equal fury on both &s;ides, and continued to rage with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s till two in the afternoon, when the van of the French gave way: neverthele&s;s, the fight was maintained till night, when the enemy bore away to leeward. The wind &s;hifting before morning, the French gained the weather-gage; but they made no u&s;e of this advantage: for two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days the Engli&s;h admiral endeavoured to renew the engagement, which the count de Tholou&s;e declined, and at la&s;t he di&s;appeared. The lo&s;s was pretty equal on both &s;ides, though not a &s;ingle &s;hip was taken or de&s;troyed by either: but the honour of the day certainly remained with the Engli&s;h. Over and above the di&s;$d$antages we have enumerated, their bottoms were foul, and &s;everal large &s;hips had expended all their &s;hot long before the battle cea&s;ed: yet the enemy were &s;o roughly handled, that they did not venture an|other engagement during the whole war. The French king, in order to rai&s;e the drooping &s;pirits of his people, claimed the victory, and publi&s;hed an ac|count
<PB N="293" REF="2960">
of the action, which, at this di&s;tance of time, plainly proves that he was reduced to the mean &s;hift of impo&s;ing upon his &s;ubjects, by fal&s;e and partial repre&s;entations. Among other exaggerations in this detail, we find mention made of mi&s;chief done to French &s;hips by Engli&s;h bombs; though nothing is more certain, than that there was not one bomb-ve&s;&s;el in the combined fleet. The French academy, actuated by a &s;ervile &s;pirit of adulation, cau&s;ed a medal to be &s;truck on the occa&s;ion, which, in&s;tead of perpetuating the glory of their prince, &s;erves only to tran&s;mit their own &s;hame to po&s;terity. After the battle, Sir George Rooke &s;ailed to Gibraltar to refit, and leaving a &s;quadron with Sir John Leake, &s;et &s;ail for England on the twenty-fourth day of Augu&s;t. He arrived in September, and was received by the mini&s;try, and the people in general, with tho&s;e marks of e&s;teem and veneration which were due to his long &s;ervices and &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s: but he was &s;till per&s;ecuted with a &s;pirit of envy and de|traction. Philip king of Spain, alarmed at the reduction of Gibraltar, &s;ent the marquis de Villadarias with an army to retake it. The &s;iege la&s;ted four months, during which the prince of He&s;&s;e exhibited many &s;hining proofs of courage and ability. The place was &s;upplied with men and provi&s;ions by convoys from Li&s;bon, until mon&s;ieur de Pointis put a &s;top to that communi|cation, by entering the bay with a &s;trong &s;quadron: but he was obliged to retire at the approach of Sir John Leake and admiral Vanderdu&s;&s;en; and the marquis de Villadarias having made little or no progre&s;s at land, thought pro|per to abandon the enterpri&s;e.</P>

<P>The parliament of England meeting on the twenty-ninth day of October, the queen in her &s;peech ob&s;erved, that the great and remarkable &s;uc|ce&s;s with which God had ble&s;&s;ed her arms, produced unanimous joy and &s;ati&s;|faction through all parts of the kingdom; and that a timely improvement of the pre&s;ent advantages would enable her to procure a la&s;ting foundation of &s;e|curity for England, as well as a firm &s;upport for the liberty of Europe. She declared her intention was to be kind and indulgent to all her &s;ubjects. She expre&s;&s;ed her hope that they would do nothing to endanger the lo&s;s of this opportunity; and that there would be no contention among them, but an emu|lation to promote the public welfare. Contratulatory addre&s;&s;es were voted and pre&s;ented by both hou&s;es. They were equal in their profe&s;&s;ions of duty and affection to the queen; but the addre&s;&s;es imbibed a very different colour from the different factions by which the two hou&s;es were influenced. The lords congratulated her on the great and glorious &s;ucce&s;s of her arms under the com|mand of the duke of Marlborough, without deigning to mention Sir George Rooke, who had defeated the French navy at &s;ea, and added the important fortre&s;s of Gibraltar to the Briti&s;h conque&s;ts. On the other hand, the com|mons affected to mention the battle of Blenheim, and Rooke's naval victory, as events of equal glory and importance. However, they might be warped by prejudice again&s;t individuals, they did not &s;uffer the war to langui&s;h for want of &s;upplies. Having taken into con&s;ideration the &s;ervices of the army and navy, they voted that the queen &s;hould be de&s;ired to be&s;tow her bounty on the &s;eamen and land-forces who had behaved them&s;elves &s;o gallantly. Then they deliberated upon the different articles of national expence, and granted four millions &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and nine hundred and thirty-one pounds, for the occa&s;ions of the en&s;uing year, to be rai&s;ed by a land tax,
<PB N="294" REF="2970">
by the &s;al$ of an$$ities, and other expedients. The&s;e mea&s;ures were taken with &s;uch expedition, that the land-tax received the royal a&s;&s;ent on the ninth day of D$cember$ when the queen, in a &s;hort &s;peech, thanked the commons for their di&s;patch, which &s;he con&s;idered as a &s;ure pledge of their affection.</P>

<P>The high-church party took this occa&s;ion to promote the bill again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity, which was revived and brought into the hou&s;e on a new model, by Mr. William Bromley, who moved that it might be tacked to the land-tax bill, and &s;ent up to the lords for their concurrence. The court no longer e&s;pou&s;ed this mea&s;ure; and the violent party was weakened by de|fection. After a warm and tedious debate, the tack was rejected by a great majority. The bill, however, pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of commons, and was &s;ent up to the lords on the fourteenth day of December, when it would hardly have excited a debate, had not the queen been pre&s;ent, and de&s;irous of hearing what could be &s;aid on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. For the information and &s;ati&s;|faction of her maje&s;ty, the &s;ubject was again di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and all the arguments being repeated, the bill was rejected by a majority of one and twenty voices. The next &s;ubject on which the hou&s;e of lords employed their attention, was the late conduct of the Scotti&s;h parliament. The lord Haver&s;ham, in a &s;et &s;peech, ob&s;erved, that the &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in Scotland had been po&s;tponed, partly becau&s;e the mini&s;try for that kingdom were weak and di|vided; partly from a received opinion that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was never &s;incerely and cordially intended by tho&s;e who managed the affairs of Scotland in the cabinet-council. He expatiated on the bad con&s;equences that might attend the act of &s;ecurity, which he &s;tiled a bill of exclu&s;ion; and particularly men|tioned that clau&s;e by which the heritors and boroughs were ordained to exerci&s;e their $en&s;ible men every month. He &s;aid the nobility and gentry of Scotland were as learned and brave as any nation in Europe, and generally di&s;contented: that the common people were very numerous, very &s;tout, and very poor; and he a&s;ked who was the man that could tell what &s;uch a multitude, &s;o armed, and &s;o di&s;ciplined, might do under &s;uch leaders, could opportunities &s;uit their inten|tion? He recommended the&s;e circum&s;tances to the con&s;ideration of the hou&s;e, and concluded with the&s;e words of lord Bacon, <Q>&startq;Let men beware how they neglect or &s;uffer matter of troubles to be prepared; for no man can forbid the &s;parks that may &s;et all on fire.&endq;</Q> They re&s;olved to con&s;ider the&s;e &s;ub|jects on the twenty-ninth day of November, when the queen repaired to the hou&s;e of peers to hear the debates, and by her pre&s;ence moderate the heat of both p$rties$ The earl of Nottingham reflected &s;o &s;everely on the memory of king William, that $e would have been &s;ent to the Tower, had not the lords declined any &s;uch motion, out of re&s;pect to her maje&s;ty. After much declama|tion on the Scotti&s;h act of &s;ecurity, the grand committee of the peers, by the advice of lord Wharton, re&s;olved, That the queen &s;hould be enabled by act of parliament on the part of England$ to name commi&s;&s;ioners to treat about an union with Scotland, provided that the parliament of Scotland &s;hould fir&s;t ap|point commi&s;&s;ioners on their part for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. That no Scot&s;men &s;hould enjoy the privileges of Engli&s;hmen, except &s;uch as were &s;ettled in Eng|land, Ireland, and the plantations, and &s;uch as were or might be in the &s;ea or land|&s;ervice, until an union could be effected, or the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;ettled as in England: That the traffic by cattle from Scotland to England &s;hould be prevented:
<PB N="295" REF="2980">
That the lord admiral &s;hould i&s;&s;ue orders for taking &s;uch v$&s;&s;els as &s;hould be found trading from Scotland to France, or to the ports of any of her maje&s;ties enemies; and that care &s;hould be taken to prevent the exportation of Engli&s;h wool into Scotland. On the&s;e re&s;olutions a bill was formed for an inti$e union, and pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e on the twentieth day of December. The lords pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the queen, repre&s;enting that they had duly weighed the dangerous andipernicious effects that were likely to be produced by divers acts of parlia|ment lately pa&s;&s;ed in Scotland: That they were of opinion, the &s;afety of the kingdom required that &s;peedy and effectual orders &s;hould be given to put Newca&s;tle in a po&s;ture of defence, &s;ecure the port of Tinmouth, and repair the fortifications of Hull and Carlile. They likewi&s;e advi&s;ed her maje&s;ty to give directions for di&s;ciplining the militia of the four northern counties; for pro|viding them with arms and ammunition; for maintaining a competent num|ber of regular troops on the northern borders of England, as well as in the north of Ireland; and for putting the laws in execution again&s;t papi&s;ts. The queen promi&s;ed that a &s;urvey &s;hould be made of the places they had mentioned, and laid before the parliament; and that &s;he would give the nece&s;&s;ary directions upon the other articles of the addre&s;s. The commons &s;eemed to concur with the lords in their &s;entiments of the Scotti&s;h act of &s;ecurity. They re&s;olved, That a bill &s;hould be brought in for the effectual &s;ecuring the kingdom of England from the apparent dangers that might ari&s;e from &s;everal acts lately pa&s;&s;ed in the parliament of Scotland; and this was formed on nearly the &s;ame re&s;olutions which had been taken in the upper-hou&s;e. The bill &s;ent down by the lords was thrice read, and ordered to lie upon the table; while they pa&s;&s;ed their own, to take effect at Chri&s;tmas, provided before that time the Scots &s;hould not &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. When it was offered to the lords, they pa&s;&s;ed it without any amendment, contrary to the expectation, and even to the hope, of &s;ome members who were no friends to the hou&s;e of Hanover, and firmly believed the lords would have treated this bill with the &s;ame contempt which had been manife&s;ted for that which they had &s;ent down to the commons.</P>

<P>The duke of Marlborough, at his fir&s;t appearance in the hou&s;e after his return to England, was honoured with a very extraordinary eulogium, pronounced by the lord-keeper, in the name of the peers of England; and a compliment of the &s;ame nature was pre&s;ented to him by a committee of the hou&s;e of commons. Doctor Delaune, vice-chancellor of Oxford, accompanied by the principal members of the univer&s;ity, attended the queen with an addre&s;s of congratulation upon the &s;ucce&s;s of her arms in Germany, under the ad|mirable conduct and invincible courage of the duke of Marlborough; and at &s;ea, under the mo&s;t brave and faithful admiral Sir George Rooke. He re|ceived a civil an&s;wer from her maje&s;ty, though now &s;he took umbrage at Rooke's being rai&s;ed upon a level with the duke of Marlborough, who&s;e great victories had captivated her admiration, and who&s;e wife had al$enated her affection from the Tories. The commons perceiving how high he &s;tood in her maje&s;ty's e&s;teem, and having been properly tutored for the purpo&s;e, took into con&s;ideration the great &s;ervices of the duke; and, in an addre&s;s, be&s;ought her maje&s;ty to con&s;ider &s;ome proper means to perpetuate the memory of &s;uch noble actions. In a few days &s;he gave them to under&s;tand by a me&s;&s;age, that &s;he was inclined to grant the intere&s;t of the crown in the honour and manour of

Wood&s;tock and hundred of Wooton, to the duke of Marlborough and his heirs; and that, as the lieutenancy and ranger&s;hip of the parks, with the rents and profits of the manours and hundreds were granted for two lives, &s;he wi&s;hed that incumbrance could be removed. A bill was immediately brought in, enabling the queen to be&s;tow the&s;e honours and manours on the duke of Marlborough and his heirs; and the queen was de&s;ired to advance the money for clearing the incumbrances. She not only complied with this addre&s;s, but likewi&s;e ordered the comptroller of her works to build, in Wood&s;tock-park, a magnificent palace for the duke, upon a plan much more &s;olid than beautiful. By this time, Sir George Rooke was layed a&s;ide, and the command of the fleet be&s;towed upon Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel, now declared rear admiral of England. Marechal de Tallard, with the other French generals taken at Hock&s;tadt, arrived on the &s;ixteenth of December in the river Thames, and were immediately con|veyed to Nottingham and Litchfield, where they were attended by a detach|ment of the royal regiment of hor&s;e-guards. They were treated with great re&s;pect, and allowed the privilege of riding ten miles around the places of their confinement.</P>

<P>While the hou&s;e of commons, in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive addre&s;&s;es, thanked the queen for the treaty which the duke of Marlborough had concluded with Pru&s;&s;ia, concerning the troops to be &s;ent to the duke of Savoy; and de&s;ired &s;he would u&s;e her intere&s;t with the allies, that they might next year furni&s;h their complete proportions of men by &s;ea and land; the lords examined into all the proceedings at &s;ea, and all the in&s;tructions of the admiralty; and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the queen, explaining all the different articles of mi&s;manage|ment. She promi&s;ed to con&s;ider them particularly, and give &s;uch directions upon them as might be mo&s;t for the advantage of the public &s;ervice. The re|maining part of the &s;e&s;&s;ion was con&s;umed in di&s;putes and altercations between the two hou&s;es, on the &s;ubject of the Ayle&s;bury con&s;tables, who were &s;ued by five other inhabitants, for having denied them the right of voting at the election. The&s;e five per&s;ons were committed to Newgate by order of the hou&s;e of com|mons. They moved for a habeas corpus in the king's-bench; but the court would take no cognizance of the affair. Two of the pri&s;oners petitioned the queen that their ca&s;e might be brought before her maje&s;ty in parliament. The commons$ in an addre&s;s, be&s;ought the queen to refu&s;e granting a writ of error in this ca&s;e, which would tend to the overthrowing the undoubted rights and privileges of the commons of England. She a&s;&s;ured them &s;he would not do any thing to give them ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint; but this matter relating to the cour&s;e of judicial proceedings, being of the highe&s;t importance, &s;he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to weigh and con&s;ider very carefully what might be proper for her to do in a thing of &s;o great concern. They voted all the lawyers who had pleaded on the return of the habeas corpus in behalf of the pri&s;oners, guilty of a breach of privilege; and ordered them to be taken into cu&s;tody. They like|wi&s;e ordered the pri&s;oners to be removed from Newgate into the cu&s;tody of their &s;erjeant at arms, le&s;t they &s;hould have been di&s;charged by the queen's granting writs of error. T$e pri&s;oners finding them&s;elves at the mercy of the exa&s;pe|rated commons, petitioned the lords for relief. The upper-hou&s;e pa&s;&s;ed &s;ix dif|ferent re&s;olutions again&s;t the conduct of the commons, as being an ob&s;truction to ju&s;tice, and contrary to magna charta. The lower-hou&s;e demanded a con|ference,
<PB N="297" REF="3000">
in which they in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;ole right of determining elections; they affirmed, that they only could judge who had a right of voting; and, that they were judges of their own privileges, in which the lords could not intermeddle.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The upper hou&s;e demanded a free conference, which proved in|effectual. New re&s;olutions were taken by the commons, diametrically oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of the peers, who, on the other hand, attended the queen with a long repre&s;entation of all the particulars relating to this affair. They affirmed, that the proceedings of the hou&s;e of commons again&s;t the Ayle&s;bury men were wholly new and unprecedented: that it was the birthright of every Engli&s;h|man who apprehended him&s;elf injured, to &s;eek for redre&s;s in her maje&s;ty's courts of ju&s;tice: that if any power could controul this right, and pre&s;cribe when he &s;hould, and when he &s;hould not, be allowed the benefit of the laws, he cea&s;ed to be a freeman, and his liberty and property were precarious. They reque&s;ted, therefore, that no con&s;ideration whatever &s;hould prevail with her ma|je&s;ty to &s;uffer an ob&s;truction to the known cour&s;e of ju&s;tice; but, that &s;he would be plea&s;ed to give effectual orders for the immediate i&s;&s;uing of the writs of error. The queen a&s;&s;ured them, that &s;he &s;hould have complied with their reque&s;t; but, finding an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for putting an immediate end to this &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;he knew there could be no further proceedings on that matter. On that very day, which was the fourteenth of March, &s;he went to the hou&s;e of lords, and pa&s;&s;ed the bills that were ready for the royal a&s;&s;ent. Then &s;he thanked the parliament for having di&s;patched the public bu&s;ine&s;s, warned them to avoid the fatal effects of animo&s;ity and di&s;&s;en&s;ion; and, ordered the lord-keeper to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.

Voltaire.</NOTE> prorogue them to Thur&s;day the fir&s;t of May: but, on the fifth of April, they were di&s;&s;olved by proclamation, and another was publi&s;hed for calling a new parliament. The queen, accompanied by the prince of Denmark, made an excur&s;ion to New-market, and afterwards dined by invitation with the univer|&s;ity of Cambridge, where &s;he conferred the honour of knighthood upon Dr. Ellis the vice-chancellor, James Montague coun&s;el for the univer&s;ity, and the celebrated I&s;aac Newton mathematical profe&s;&s;or. The two hou&s;es of convoca|tion &s;till continued at variance. The lower hou&s;e penned petulant repre&s;enta|tions; and, the ar$hbi&s;hop an&s;wered them by verbal reprehen&s;ion and admoni|tion. The Tory $ntere&s;t was now in the wane. The duke of Buckingham|&s;hire was deprived of the privy-&s;eal, and that office conferred upon the d$ke of Newca&s;tle, a nobleman of powerful influence with the Whig party. The earl of Montague was created marquis of Mounthermer and duke of Monta|gue; the earl of Peterborough and lord Cholmondley were cho&s;en of the privy|council; and the lord Cutts was &s;ent to command the troops in Ireland, under the duke of Ormond.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1705.</NOTE> The mini&s;try of Scotland was now intirely changed. The marquis of Tweedale and John&s;ton having been found unequal to the un|dertaking, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The duke of Queen&s;berry re&s;umed the manage|ment of a$fairs in that kingdom, under the title of lord privy-&s;eal; and the office of commi&s;&s;ioner was conferred upon the young duke of Argyle, who &s;uc|ceeded to his father's influence among the pre&s;byterians. He was a nobleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;$d of good natural talents, which had not been neglected; candid, open and &s;incere, brave, pa&s;&s;ionate, and a&s;piring: had he been endued with a greater
<PB N="298" REF="3010">
&s;hare of liberality, his character would have been truly heroic. At this junc|ture, he was in&s;tructed to procure an act of the Scotti&s;h parliament &s;ettling the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; or, to &s;et on foot a treaty for the union of the two king|doms. At the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion in June, the members were divided into three parties, namely, the Cavaliers or Jacobites, the revolutioners, the &s;qua|drone volante, or flying &s;quadron, headed by the marquis of Tweedale, who di&s;|claimed the other two factions, and pretended to act from the dictates of con|&s;cience alone. The parliament was adjourned to the third day of July, when her maje&s;ty's letter was read, earne&s;tly recommending the &s;ettlement of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant line; and, an act for a commi&s;&s;ion to treat of an union between the two kingdoms. The marquis of Annandale propo&s;ed, that the parliament &s;hould proceed on the limitations and conditions of government: and, that a committee &s;hould be appointed to con&s;ider the condition of the coin and the commerce of the nation. The earl of Mar moved, that the hou&s;e would$ preferably to all other bu&s;ine&s;s, con&s;ider the means for engaging in a treaty with England. After a long debate, they re&s;olved to proceed on the coin and the commerce. Schemes for &s;upplying the nation with money by a paper-credit were pre&s;ented by Dr. Hugh Chamberlayne and John Law; but rejected. The hou&s;e re&s;olved, That any kind of paper-credit, by the circula|tion of bills, was an improper expedient; and appointed a council to put the laws relating to trade in execution. The duke of Hamilton propo&s;ed, that the parliament &s;hould not proceed to the nomination of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, until the treaty with England &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and the limitations be &s;ettled. This propo&s;al being approved, a draught of an an&s;wer to her maje&s;ty's letter was pre&s;ented by the marquis of Tweedale. Two different forms of an act for a treaty with England were offered by the earl of Mar and the marquis of Lo|thian; and, others were produced concerning the election of officers of &s;tate, and the regulation of commerce.</P>

<P>The chief aim of the cavaliers was, to ob&s;truct the &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and, with that view they pre&s;&s;ed the project of limitations, to which they knew the court would never a&s;&s;ent. A motion being made, to grant the fir&s;t reading to an act of commi&s;&s;ion for a treaty with England, the duke of Hamilton in&s;i&s;ted on the limitations, and a vote being &s;tated in the&s;e terms, "Proceed to con&s;ider the act for a treaty, or limitation:" the latter was carried in favour of the cavaliers. On the twenty-&s;econd day of Augu&s;t an act for this purpo&s;e was approved; and next day an act for a triennial parlia|ment, which the courtiers were enabled to defeat. They likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed an act, ordaining, That the Scotti&s;h amba&s;&s;adors repre&s;enting Scotland &s;hould be pre|&s;ent when the &s;overeign might have occa&s;ion to treat with foreign princes and &s;tates; and accountable to the parliament of Scotland. Fletcher of Saltoun pre&s;ented a &s;cheme of limitations that favoured &s;trong of republican princi|ples. He afterwards enlarged upon every article, endeavouring to prove, that they were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the con&s;equences of Engli&s;h influence$ to $nable the nation to defend its rights and liberties; to deter mini&s;ters of &s;tate from giving bad advice to their &s;overeign; to pre&s;erve the courts of judicature from corruption, and &s;creen the people from tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. The earl of Stair having argued again&s;t the&s;e limitations, Fletcher replied, <Q>&startq;It was no won|der he oppo&s;ed the &s;cheme; for, had &s;uch an act &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, his lord&s;hip would
<PB N="299" REF="3020">
have been hanged for the bad coun&s;el he had given to king James; for the concern he had in the ma&s;&s;acre of Glencoe; and, for his conduct &s;ince the revo|lution.&endq;</Q> The next &s;ubject on which the parliament deliberated, was the con|&s;piracy. A motion being made, that the hou&s;e might know what an&s;wer the queen had returned to their addre&s;s in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, the chancellor delivered to the clerk-regi&s;ter the papers relating to the plot, that they might be peru&s;ed by the members. But, the&s;e being copies, and the evidences remaining at Lon|don, no farther progre&s;s was made in the affair. Yet, the duke of Athol, in a di&s;tinct narrative of the pretended con&s;piracy, boldly accu&s;ed the duke of Queen&s;berry, of having endeavoured to mi&s;lead the queen by fal&s;e in&s;inuations again&s;t her good &s;ubjects. When the act for a treaty of union fell under con&s;i|deration, a draught for that purpo&s;e, pre&s;ented by the earl of Mar, was com|pared with the Engli&s;h act, impo$ting, That the queen &s;hould name and appoint not only the commi&s;&s;ioners for England, but likewi&s;e tho&s;e for Scotland$ Fletcher did not fail to inveigh again&s;t the imperious conduct of the Engli&s;h parliament in this affair. He exhorted the hou&s;e to re&s;ent &s;uch treatment$ and offered the draught of an addre&s;s to her maje&s;ty on the &s;ubject; but, this the hou&s;e rejected. Duke Hamilton propo&s;ed, that a clau&s;e might be added to the act, importing, That the union &s;hould no ways derogate from any funda|mental laws, antient privileges, offices, rights, liberties, and dignities of the Scotti&s;h nation. This occa&s;ioned a long debate; and, the que&s;tion being put, was carried in the negative. Another clau&s;e was propo&s;ed, that the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould not begin to treat until the Engli&s;h parliament &s;hould have re&s;cinded their clau&s;e, enacting, That the &s;ubjects of Scotland &s;hould be adjudged and taken as aliens after the twenty-fifth day of December. The courtiers con&s;idering the temper of the hou&s;e, would not venture to oppo&s;e this motion di|rectly, but propo&s;ed, that the clau&s;e &s;hould be formed into a &s;eparate act; and the expedient was approved. Though the duke of Athol entered a vigorous prote&s;t, to which the greater part of the cavaliers, and all the &s;quadrone ad|hered, comprehending four and twenty peers, &s;even and thirty barons, and eighteen buroughs, the act for the treaty of union was, after much alterca|tion fini&s;hed, impowering commi&s;&s;ioners to meet and treat of an union; but re&s;training them from treating of any alterations of the church-government a$ by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. While this important &s;ubject was under con&s;ideration, the duke of Hamilton, to the amazement of his whole party, moved, that the no|mination of the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be left to the queen. Fourteen or fifteen of the cavaliers ran out of the hou&s;e in a tran&s;port of indignation, exclaiming, that they were de&s;erted and ba&s;ely betrayed by the duke of Hamilton. A very hot debate en&s;ued, in the cour&s;e of which the duke was &s;everely handled by tho&s;e whom he had hitherto conducted; but, at length, the que&s;tion being put, Whe|ther the nomination &s;hould be left to the queen or to the parliament? the duke's motion was approved by a very &s;mall majority. He afterwards excu&s;ed him|&s;elf for his defection, by &s;aying, he &s;aw it was in vain to contend; and that, &s;ince the court had acquired a great majority, he thought he might be allowed to pay that compliment to his &s;overeign. He was de&s;irous of being in the commi&s;&s;ion, and the duke of Argyle promi&s;ed he &s;hould be nominated. The queen refu&s;ing to honour him with that mark of di&s;tinction, Argyle would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be named, and threatened to oppo&s;e the union;
<PB N="300" REF="3030">
but, means were found to appea&s;e his re&s;entment. Two draughts of an addre&s;s being pre&s;ented by the earl of Sutherland and Fletcher of Saltoun, be&s;eeching her maje&s;ty to u&s;e her endeavours with the parliament of England, to re&s;cind that part of their act which declared the &s;ubjects of Scotland aliens; and, an over|ture of a bill being offered$ ordaining, that the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould not enter upon the treaty of union until that clau&s;e &s;hould be repealed; the courtiers moved, that the parliament &s;hould proceed by way of order to their commi&s;&s;ioners, and by addre&s;s to her maje&s;ty. After &s;ome debate, the hou&s;e affenting to this propo&s;al, the order and addre&s;s were drawn up and approved. The great and weighty affair of the treaty being at length happily tran&s;acted, though not without a prote&s;t by Athol and his adherents, the parliament granted a &s;upply of fifty thou&s;and pounds; and the hou&s;e was adjourned to the twentieth day of December$ then the queen declared the earl of Mar &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate, in the room of the marquis of Annandale, who was appointed lord-pre&s;ident of the council.</P>

<P>In Ireland the parliament met at Dublin on the fifth day of March, and voted one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds for the &s;upport of the nece&s;|&s;ary branches of the e&s;tabli&s;hment. A di&s;pute aro&s;e between the commons and the lower hou&s;e of convocation, relating to the tythes of hemp and flax, a&s;cer|tained in a clau&s;e of a bill for the better improvement of the hempen and flaxen manufactures of the kingdom. The lower hou&s;e of convocation pre&s;ented a memorial again&s;t this clau&s;e, as prejudicial to the rights and properties of the clergy. The commons voted the per&s;on who brought it guilty of a breach of privilege; and ordered him to be taken into cu&s;tody. Then they re&s;olved, That the convocation were guilty of a contempt, and breach of the privilege of that hou&s;e. The convocation pre&s;uming to ju&s;tify their memorial, the com|mons voted, That all matters relating to it &s;hould be razed out of the journals and books of convocation. The duke of Ormond, dreading the con&s;equence of &s;uch heats, adjourned the parliament to the fir&s;t day of May, when the hou&s;es meeting again, came to &s;ome re&s;olutions that reflected obliquely on the convo|cation, as enemies to her maje&s;ty's government and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The clergy, in order to acquit them&s;elves of all &s;u&s;picion, re&s;olved in their turn, That the church and nation had been happily delivered from popery and tyran|ny by king William at the revolution: That the continuance of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings were due (under God) to the au&s;picious reign and happy government of her ma|je&s;ty queen Anne: That the future &s;ecurity and pre&s;ervation of the church and nation depended wholly (under God$ on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown as &s;ettled by law in the prote&s;tant line: That if any clergyman &s;hould by word or writing declare any thing in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e re&s;olutions, they &s;hould look upon him as a &s;ower of divi&s;ions among the prote&s;tants, and an enemy to the con&s;titution. They levelled another re&s;olution again&s;t the pre&s;byterians, importing, That to teach or preach again&s;t the doctrine, government, rites, or ceremonies of the church, or to maintain &s;chools or &s;eminaries for the education of youth, in principles contrary to tho&s;e of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, was a contempt of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws of the kingdom; of pernicious con&s;equence; and &s;erved only to continue and widen the unhappy &s;chi&s;ms and divi&s;ions in the nation. In June the parliament was prorogued to the &s;ame month of the following year; then the duke of Ormond embarked for England, leaving the admini&s;tration in the
<PB N="301" REF="3040">
hands of Sir Richard Cox lord-chancellor, and the lord Cutts commander in chief of the queen's forces, who were appointed lords-ju&s;tices during the duke's ab&s;ence.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in Great-Britain and Ireland, the allies had not been remi&s;s in their preparations for the en&s;uing campaign. The duke of Marlborough had fixed upon the Mo&s;elle for the &s;cene of action; and, ma|gazines of all &s;orts were formed at Triers. On the thirteenth day of March the duke embarked for Holland, where he prevailed upon the &s;tates-general to contribute their troops for the execution of his project. Having concerted with the deputies of the &s;tates and the Dutch generals, the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for opening the campaign, he &s;et out for Mae&s;tricht, in order to a&s;&s;emble his army. On the fifth day of May the emperor Leopold died at Vienna, and was &s;uc|ceeded on the Imperial throne by his elde&s;t &s;on Jo&s;eph king of the Romans, a prince who re&s;embled his father in meekne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, narrowne&s;s of in|tellect, and bigotry to the romi&s;h religion. On the fifteenth of June the Eng|li&s;h troops pa&s;&s;ed the Mae&s;e, and continued their march towards the Mo&s;elle, under the command of general Churchill; and, the duke &s;et out for Creutznach, to confer with prince Lewis of Baden, who excu&s;ed him&s;elf on pretence of being much indi&s;po&s;ed. Marlborough vi&s;ited him at Ra&s;tadt, where$ in a conference they re&s;olved, that a &s;ufficient number of German troops &s;hould be left for the &s;ecurity of the lines of Lauterburg and Stolhoffen, under the command of ge|neral Thungen; and, that prince Lewis of Baden &s;hould march with a large detachment towards the Saar, to act in concert with the duke of Marlborough. The confederate army pa&s;&s;ed the Mo&s;elle and the Saar in the beginning of June, and encamped at Elft in &s;ight of the enemy, who retired with great precipitation, and intrenched them&s;elves in the neighbourhood of Coning&s;|macheren. The duke's de&s;ign was to be&s;iege Saar-Louis; but, prince Lewis failed in the performance of his engagement: he feigned him&s;elf &s;ick, and repaired to the bath at Schlangenbade, leaving the &s;mall number of Imperial troops he had conducted as far as Creutznach, under the command of the count de Frize. He was &s;u&s;pected of treachery; but probably acted from envy of the duke's military reputation.</P>

<P>While this nobleman &s;u&s;tained &s;uch a mortifying di&s;appoint|ment on the Mo&s;elle, the French did not fail to make advantage of their &s;upe|riority in the Netherlands, where general Overkirk was obliged to &s;tand on the defen&s;ive. They inve&s;ted Huy, and carried on their operations &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that in a few days the garri&s;on were obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war: then Villeroy undertook the reduction of Liege, and actually began his works before the citadel. Marlborough was no &s;ooner informed of the enemy's progre&s;s than he marched to Triers, where, in a council it was re&s;olved, that the army &s;hould return to the Netherlands. The troops were in motion on the nineteenth of June, and marched with &s;uch expedition, that they pa&s;&s;ed the Mae&s;e on the fir&s;t day of July. Villeroy having received advice of the duke's approach, abandoned his enterprize, and retired to Tongeren, from whence he retreated within his lines. Marlborough having joined Overkirk, &s;ent general Scholten with a detachment to inve&s;t Huy; and, in a few days the garri&s;on &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. The Engli&s;h general re&s;olving to &s;trike &s;ome &s;troke of importance, that &s;hould attone for his di&s;appointment on the Mo&s;elle, &s;ent general Hompe&s;ch to the &s;tates, with a propo&s;al for attacking the French lines;
<PB N="302" REF="3050">
and obtained their permi&s;&s;$on to do whatever he &s;hould think proper for the good of the common cau&s;e. T$en he explained the &s;cheme in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive counc$ls of war, by which, at length, it was approved and re&s;olved upon, tho' &s;ome Dutch gener$$s de$lared again&s;t the undertaking. The enemy were po&s;ted along the lines, amounting to one hundred battalions and one hundred and forty-&s;ix &s;qu$$rons. The al$$ed army did not much exceed that number. In order to divide them, Overkirk made a fal&s;e motion and pa$$ed the Mehaigne, as if he had intended to attack the lines about Meffelin; and, the &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded The French weakened the other parts by &s;trengthening that which was on the &s;ide of the Gerbi&s;e towards Namur. The duke of Marlborough having made the di&s;po&s;ition, the army began to march in the night between the &s;even|teenth and eighteenth of July, in order to force a pa&s;&s;age of the French lines at Elixheim, the ca&s;tle of Waugh, and the villages of Waugh, Neerhe&s;pen, and Oo&s;tmalen. The&s;e po&s;ts were taken with very little difficulty; but, before the $nfantry could come up, the enemy advanced with fifty &s;quadrons and twe$$y battalions, and began to fire from eight pieces of cannon with triple barrels, which did con&s;iderable execution. The duke perceiving that they were con|tinually reinforced from the other parts of the lines, ordered the hor&s;e to charge their cavalry, which were &s;oon broken and routed; but rallying behind their infantry, interlined with foot, and joined by fre&s;h &s;quadrons, they advanced again towards the allies, who were now &s;u&s;tained by their infantry, and moved forwards to renew the charge. After a warm, though &s;hort engagement, the enemy's hor&s;e were defeated with great &s;laughter. The infantry, &s;eeing them&s;elves abandoned in the plain, retreated in great di&s;order, between the villages of Heili&s;heim and Gol&s;teven, where they were joined by the re&s;t of their army, and formed again in order of battle. Mean while, the duke of Marlborough or|dered all his troops to enter the lines; and extended his right towards the Great Geete before Tirlemont, where the enemy had left the battalion of Montluc, which &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. In this action the confederates took the marquis D'Alegre and the count de $$orne, lieutenant$generals, one major-general, two brigadier-generals, with many other officers, and a great number of common &s;oldiers, a large heap of &s;tandards, four colours, one pair of $ettle-drums, and ten pieces of cannon. In the action, as the duke of Marlborough advanced to the charge at the head of &s;everal &s;quadrons, a Bavarian officer rode up to attack him &s;word in hand; but$ in rai&s;ing him&s;elf on his &s;tirrups to &s;trike with the greater advantage, he fell from his hor&s;e, and was immediately &s;lain.</P>

<P>The body of troops commanded by mon&s;ieur D'Alegre being thus defeated with little or no lo&s;s to the confederates, the elector of Bavaria and the marechal de V$$eroy pa&s;ied the Great Geete and the Deule, with great expe|dition, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;$on of the &s;trong camp at Parck, their left extending to Roo$elaer, and their right to Wine&s;elen again&s;t the height of Louvain. Next day the duke of Marlborough marching through the plain of Parck, took twelve hundred pri&s;oners, who could not keep pace with the re&s;t of the enemy's forces; and, in the evening he encamped with the right at the abbey of Vlier&s;|beck, and the left before Bie$beck, under the cannon of Louvain. He detached lieutenant-general Henkelum, the duke of Wirtemberg, and count Oxien&s;tiern, with a con&s;iderable body of forces, to attack &s;ome po&s;ts on the Deule, which were &s;ienderly guarded. Their advanced guard accordingly pa&s;&s;ed the river, and
<PB N="303" REF="3060">
repul&s;ed the enemy; but, for want of timely &s;upport they were obliged to pa&s;s it and retire. On the third of Augu&s;t baron Spaar, with a body of Dutch troops, marched to Raboth on the canal of Bruges, forced the French lines at Loven|degen, and took four forts by which they were defended; but receiving advice that the enemy were on their march towards him, he retired to Mildegem, and carried with him &s;everal ho&s;tages as &s;ecurity for the payment of the contribu|tions he had rai&s;ed. On the fifteenth the duke moved from Mildert to Cor|bais; next day continued his march to Genap, from whence he advanced to Fi&s;chermont. On the &s;eventeenth general Overkirk took the po&s;t of Waterlo; and next day the confederate army was drawn up in order of battle before the enemy, who extended from Overy&s;che near the wood of Soignies to Neery&s;che, with the little river Y&s;che in their front, &s;o as to cover Bru&s;&s;els and Louvain. The duke of Marlborough propo&s;ed to attack them immediately before they &s;hould recollect them&s;elves from their con&s;ternation; and Overkirk approved of the de&s;ign. But, it was oppo&s;ed by general Schlangenburgh and other Dutch officers, who repre&s;ented it in &s;uch a light to the deputies of the &s;tates, that they refu&s;ed to concur in the execution. The duke being obliged to relinqui&s;h the &s;cheme, wrote an expo&s;tulatory letter to the &s;tates-general, complaining of their having withdrawn that confidence which they had repo&s;ed in him while he acted in Germany. This letter being publi&s;hed at the Hague, excited mur|murs among the people; and the Engli&s;h nation were incen&s;ed at the pre|&s;umption of the deputies, who wrote &s;everal letters in their own ju&s;tification to the &s;tates-general; but the&s;e had no effect upon the populace, by whom the duke was re&s;pected even to a degree of adoration. The &s;tates being appri&s;ed of the re&s;entment that prevailed over all England, and that the earl of Pembroke, lord-pre&s;ident of the council, was appointed as envoy extraordinary to Holland, with in&s;tructions to demand &s;atisfaction, thought proper to anticipate his jour|ney, by making &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the duke, and removing Schlangenburgh from his command. The confederate army returned to Corbais, from whence it marched to Perwitz, where it encamped. The little town of Sout-Leewe, &s;itu|ated in the middle of a mora&s;s, and con&s;tituting the chief defence of the ene|my's lines, being taken by a detachment under the command of lieutenant|general Dedem, the duke ordered the lines from this place to Wa&s;&s;eigne to be levelled, and the town of Tirlemont to be di&s;mantled: then pa&s;&s;ing the Demer, he encamped on the nineteenth day of September at Ar&s;chot. About the latter end of the month he marched to Heventhals: from hence the duke re|paired to the Hague, where he had &s;everal conferences with the pen&s;ionary. In a few days he returned to the army, which decamping from Heventhals, marched to Clampthout. On the twenty-fourth day of October the count de Noyelles inve&s;ted Santvliet, which &s;urrendered before the end of the month.</P>

<P>At this period the duke, in con&s;equence of pre&s;&s;ing letters from the emperor, &s;et out for Vienna, in order to concert the operations of the en&s;uing campaign, and other mea&s;ures of importance, in which the concerns of the allies were intere&s;ted. In his way he was magnificently entertained by the elector palatine, and him of Triers, and complimented by the magi&s;tracy of Francfort, where he conferred with prince Lewis of Baden. On the twelfth of Novem|ber he arrived at Vienna, where he was treated with the highe&s;t marks of di&s;|tinction and cordial friend&s;hip by their Imperial maje&s;ties. His &s;on-in-law the
<PB N="304" REF="3070">
earl of Sunderland, had been &s;ent thither as envoy extraordinary; and, now they conferred together with the emperor and his mini&s;ters. They re&s;olved to main|tain the war with redoubled vigour. The treaties were renewed; and provi&s;ion made for the &s;ecurity of the duke of Savoy. The emperor, in con&s;ideration of the duke's &s;ignal &s;ervice to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, pre&s;ented him with a grant of the lord|&s;hip of Mindelheim in Suabia, which was now erected into a principality of the Roman empire. In his return with the earl of Sunderland, he vi&s;ited the courts of Berlin and Hanover, where he was received with that extraordinary re&s;pect which was due to his character; and arrived at the Hague on the fourteenth day of December. There he &s;ettled the operations of the next campaign with the &s;tates-general, who con&s;ented to join England in maintaining an additional body of ten thou&s;and men, as a reinforcement to the army of prince Eugene in Italy. While the allies were engaged in the &s;iege of Santvliet, the elector of Bavaria &s;ent a detachment, under the command of Don Marcello de Grimaldi, to inve&s;t Die&s;t, the garri&s;on of which were made pri&s;oners of war.</P>

<P>On the Upper Rhine marechal Villars be&s;ieged and took Hom|burg, and pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Stra&s;burg on the &s;ixth day of Augu&s;t. But prince Lewis of Baden arriving in the camp of the Imperiali&s;ts at Stolhoffen, not only obliged him to retire, but having pa&s;&s;ed the river, forced the French lines at Hagenau: then he reduced Dru&s;enheim and Hagenau, but attempted no enterprize equal to the number of his army, although the emperor had ex|po&s;tulated with him &s;everely on his conduct; and he had now a fair opportunity of emulating the glory of Marlborough, upon whom he looked with the eyes of an envious rival. In Italy a battle was fought at Ca&s;ano, between prince Eugene and the duke of Vendome, with dubious &s;ucce&s;s. The duke de Feuil|lade reduced Chivas, and inve&s;ted Nice; which, after an ob&s;tinate defence, &s;ur|rendered in December. All the con&s;iderable places belonging to the duke of Savoy were now taken, except Coni and Turin; and, his little army was reduced to twelve thou&s;and men, whom he could hardly &s;upport. His dutche&s;s$ his clergy, and his &s;ubjects in general, pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;ubmit to the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs; but he adhered to the alliance with &s;urpri&s;ing fortitude. He with|&s;tood the importunities of his dutche&s;s, excluded all the bi&s;hops and clergy from his councils; and, when he had occa&s;ion for a confe&s;&s;or, cho&s;e a prie&s;t occa&s;ionally, either from the Dominicans or Franci&s;cans. The campaign in Portugal began with a very promi&s;ing a&s;pect. The allies invaded Spain by the different frontiers of Beyra and Alentejo. Their army, under the command of the Conde das Galveas, undertook the &s;iege of Valencia D'Alcantara in May, and took it by a&s;&s;ault: Albuquerque &s;urrendered upon articles; and, then the troops were &s;ent into quarters of refre&s;hment. The marquis de las Minas, who commanded the Portugue&s;e in the province of Beyra, reduced the town of Salva-terra, plundered and burned Sarca; but was obliged to retire to Pena|macos at the approach of the enemy. Towards the end of September the con|federates being rea&s;&s;embled, inve&s;ted Badajox, by the advice of the earl of Gal|way, who lo&s;t his right hand by a cannon-ball, and was obliged to be carried off; &s;o that the conduct of the &s;iege was left to general Fagel. He had made con|&s;iderable progre&s;s towards the reduction of the place, when the marquis de The&s;&s;e found means to throw in a powerful reinforcement; and then the con|federates abandoned the enterprize. The war continued to rage in Hungary
<PB N="305" REF="3080">
with various &s;ucce&s;s. Ragot&s;ki, though frequently wor&s;ted, appeared &s;till in arms, and ravaged the country, which became a &s;cene of mi&s;ery and de&s;olation. In Poland the old cardinal primate owned Stani&s;laus, but died before the co|ronation, which was performed by the bi&s;hop of Cujavia. In the beginning of winter king Augu&s;tus had pa&s;&s;ed through Poland in di&s;gui&s;e to the Mu&s;covite army, which was put under his command in Lithuania; and, the campaign was protracted through the whole winter-&s;ea&s;on, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the weather in that northern climate. In the &s;pring the Swedi&s;h general Rein|child obtained a complete victory over the Saxon army, which was either cut in pieces, or taken with their camp, baggage, and artillery: yet, the war was not extingui&s;hed. The king of Sweden continued ob&s;tinately deaf to all pro|po&s;als of peace, and was become as &s;avage in his manners as brutal in his revenge.</P>

<P>At &s;ea the arms of the allies were generally pro&s;perous. Philip of Spain being ob&s;tinately bent upon retaking Gibraltar, &s;ent marechal de The&s;$&ebreve; to renew the &s;iege, while De Pointis was ordered to block up the place by &s;ea with his &s;quadron. The&s;e French officers carried on the &s;iege with &s;uch activity, that the prince of He&s;&s;e di&s;patched an expre&s;s to Li&s;bon with a letter, de&s;iring Sir John Leake to &s;ail immediately to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This admiral having been reinforced from England by Sir Thomas Dilkes, with five &s;hips of the line and a body of troops, &s;et &s;ail immediately; and, on the tenth day of March de&s;cried five &s;hips of war hauling out of the bay of Gibraltar. The&s;e were commanded by De Pointis in per&s;on, to whom the Engli&s;h admiral gave chace. One of them &s;truck, after having made a very &s;light re&s;i&s;tance; and, the re&s;t ran a&s;hore to the we&s;tward of Marbella, where they were de&s;troyed. The remaining part of the French &s;quadron had been blown from their anchors, and taken &s;helter in the bay of Malaga; but, now they &s;lipped their cables, and made the be&s;t of their way to Toulon. The marechal de The&s;&s;&ebreve;, in con|&s;equence of this di&s;a&s;ter, turned the &s;iege of Gibraltar into a blockake, and withdrew the greater part of his forces. While Sir John Leake was employed in this expedition, Sir George Byng, who had been ordered to cruize in &s;ound|ings for the protection of trade, took a &s;hip of forty guns from the enemy, to|gether with twelve privateers, and &s;even ve&s;&s;els richly laden from the We&s;t-Indies.</P>

<P>But the mo&s;t eminent atchievement of this &s;ummer was the re|duction of Barcelona, by the celebrated earl of Peterborough and Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel, who &s;ailed from St. Helen's in the latter end of May with the Engli&s;h fleet, having on board a body of five thou&s;and land-forces; and, on the twen|tieth of June arrived at Li&s;bon, where they were joined by Sir John Leake and the Dutch admiral Allemonde. In a council of war, they determined to put to &s;ea with eight and forty &s;hips of the line, which &s;hould be &s;tationed between Cape Spartel and the bay of Cadiz, in order to prevent the junction of the Toulon and Bre&s;t &s;quadrons. The prince of He&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tadt arriving from Gibraltar, a&s;&s;ured king Charles, that the province of Catalonia and the king|dom of Valencia were attached to his intere&s;t; and, his maje&s;ty being weary of Portugal, re&s;olved to accompany the earl of Peterborough to Barcelona. He accordingly embarked with him on board of the Ranelagh; and, the fleet &s;ailed on the twenty-eighth day of July, the earl of Galway having reinforced them
<PB N="$06" REF="3090">
with two regiments of Engli&s;h dragoons. At Gibraltar they took on board the Engli&s;h guards, and three old regiments, in lieu of which they left two new-rai&s;ed battalions. On the eleventh day of Augu&s;t they anchored in the bay of Altea, where the earl of Peterborough publi&s;hed a manife&s;to in the Spani&s;h language, which had &s;uch an effect, that all the inhabitants of the place, the neighbouring villages, and adjacent mountains, acknowledged king Charles as their lawful &s;overeign. They &s;eized the town of Denia for his &s;ervice; and, he &s;ent thither a garri&s;on of four hundred men under the command of major-general Ramos. On the twenty-&s;econd they arrived in the bay of Barcelona: the troops were di&s;embarked to the ea&s;tward of the city, where they encamped in a &s;trong &s;ituation; and were well received by the country-people. King Charles landed amid&s;t the acclamations of an infinite multitude from the neigh|bouring towns and villages, who threw them&s;elves at his feet, exclaiming, "Long live the king!" and exhibited all the marks of the mo&s;t extravagant joy. The inhabitants of Barcelona were well affected to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, but overawed by a garri&s;on of five thou&s;and men under the duke de Popoli, Vela&s;co, and other officers devoted to the intere&s;t of king Philip. Con&s;idering the &s;trength of &s;uch a garri&s;on, and the &s;mall number of Dutch and Engli&s;h troops, nothing could appear more de&s;perate and dangerous than the de&s;ign of be&s;ieging the place; yet this was propo&s;ed by the prince of He&s;&s;e-D'Arm&s;tadt, who &s;erved in the expedition as a volunteer, &s;trongly urged by king Charles, and approved by the earl of Peterborough and Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel. The city was accordingly inve&s;ted on one &s;ide; but, as a previous &s;tep to the reduction of it, they re&s;olved to attack the fort of Montjuic, &s;trongly &s;ituated on a hill that commanded the city. The outworks were taken by &s;torm, with the lo&s;s of the gallant prince of He&s;&s;e, who was &s;hot through the body, and in a few hours expired: then the earl of Peterborough began to bombard the body of the fort; and, a &s;hell chancing to fall into the magazine of powder, blew it up, together with the governor and &s;ome of the be&s;t officers: an accident which &s;truck &s;uch a terror into the garri&s;on, that they &s;urrendered without further re&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P>This great point being gained, the Engli&s;h general erected his batteries again&s;t the town, with the help of the Miquelets and &s;eamen: the bomb-ketches began to fire with &s;uch execution, that in a few days the governor capitulated; and, on the fourth day of October king Charles entered in triumph. All the other places in Catalonia declared for him, except Ro&s;es; &s;o that the large&s;t and riche&s;t province of Spain was conquered with an army &s;carce double the number of the garri&s;on of Barcelona. King Charles wrote with his own hand a letter to the queen of England, containing a circum&s;tantial detail of his affairs, the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of acknowledgment, and the highe&s;t encomiums on her &s;ubjects, particularly the earl of Peterborough. In a council of war it was deter|mined, that the king and the earl &s;hould continue in Catalonia with the land-forces: that Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel &s;hould return to England: that five and twenty Engli&s;h and fifteen Dutch &s;hips of war &s;hould winter at Li&s;bon, under the command of Sir John Leake and the Dutch rear-admiral Wa&s;&s;enaer: and, that four Engli&s;h and two Dutch frigates &s;hould remain at Barcelona. Don Franci&s;co de Vela&s;co was tran&s;ported to Malaga with about a thou&s;and men of his garri&s;on, the re&s;t voluntarily engaged in the &s;ervice of king Charles, and &s;ix other regiments were rai&s;ed by the &s;tates of Catalonia. The count de Ci|fuentes,
<PB N="307" REF="3100">
at the head of the Miquelets and Catalans attached to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, &s;ecured Tarragona, Torto&s;a, Lerida, San-Mattheo, Gironne, and other places. Don Raphael Nevat, revolting from Philip with his whole regiment of hor&s;e, joined general Ramos at Denia, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of &s;everal places of importance in the kingdom of Valencia. Flu&s;hed with &s;uch unexpected &s;ucce&s;s they penetrated to the capital of the &s;ame name, which they &s;urpri&s;ed, toge|ther with the marquis de Villa-Garcia, the viceroy, and the archbi&s;hop. The&s;e ad|vantages, however, were not properly improved. The court of Charles was di|vided into factions, and &s;o much time lo&s;t in di&s;putes, that the enemy &s;ent a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men into the kingdom of Valencia, under the command of the Conde de las Torres, who forthwith inve&s;ted San-Mattheo, guarded by colonel Jones at the head of five hundred Miquelets. This being a place of great con|&s;equence, on account of its &s;ituation, the earl of Peterborough marched thither with one thou&s;and infantry and two hundred dragoons; and, by means of feigned intelligence artfully conveyed to the Conde, induced that general to abandon the &s;iege with precipitation, in the apprehen&s;ion of being &s;uddenly at|tacked by a con&s;iderable army. He afterwards took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nules, and purcha&s;ing hor&s;es at Ca&s;tillon de la Plana, began to form a body of cavalry, which did good &s;ervice in the &s;equel. Having a&s;&s;embled a little army, con&s;i&s;t|ing of ten &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons, and four battalions of regular troops, with about three thou&s;and of militia, he marched to Molviedro, which was &s;urrendred to him by the governor brigadier Mahoni. Between this officer and the Spani&s;h general he excited &s;uch jealou&s;ies by dint of artifices not altogether ju&s;tifiable even in war, that the duke of Arcos was more intent upon avoiding the &s;uppo&s;ed treachery of Mahoni than upon interrupting the earl's march to Valentia, where the inhabitants expre&s;&s;ed uncommon marks of joy at his arrival. About this period a very ob&s;tinate action happened at St. I&s;tevan de Litera, where the chevalier D'Asfeldt with nine &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons, and as many battalions of French infantry, attacked colonel Wills at the head of a &s;mall detachment; but, this la&s;t being &s;upported by lieutenant-general Cuningham, who was mortally wounded in the engagement, repul&s;ed the enemy, though three times his number, with the lo&s;s of four hundred men killed upon the &s;pot. The troops on both &s;ides fought with the mo&s;t de&s;perate valour, keeping up their fire until the muzzles of their pieces met, and charging each other at the point of bayonet. The only misfortune that attended the Engli&s;h arms in the cour&s;e of this year was the capture of the Baltic fleet homeward-bound, with their convoy of three &s;hips of war, which were taken by the Dunkirk|&s;quadron under the command of the count de St. Paul, though he him&s;elf was killed in the engagement. When an account of this advantage was communi|cated to the French king, he replied with a &s;igh, <Q>&startq;Very well, I wi&s;h the &s;hips were &s;afe again in any Engli&s;h port, provided the count de St. Paul could be re&s;tored to life.&endq;</Q> After the death of the famous Du Bart; this officer was counted the be&s;t $eaman in France.</P>

<P>The kingdom of England was now wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the election of members for the new parliament. The Tories exerted them&s;elves with great indu&s;try, and propagated the cry of the church's being in danger; a cry in which the Jacobites joined with great fervour: but, notwith&s;tanding all their efforts, in word and writing, a majority of Whigs was returned; and

now the lord Godolphin, who had hitherto maintained a neutrality, thought proper openly to countenance that faction. By his intere&s;t co-operating with the influence of the dutche&s;s of Marlborough, Sir Nathan Wright was de|prived of the great-&s;eal, which was committed to Mr. William Cowper, with the title of lord-keeper. This was a lawyer of good extraction, &s;uperior ta|lents, engaging manners, and eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion. He was &s;taunch to Whig principles, and for many years had been con&s;idered as one of their be&s;t &s;peakers in the hou&s;e of commons. The new parliament meeting on the twenty-fifth day of October, a violent conte&s;t aro&s;e about the choice of a &s;peaker. Mr. Bromley was &s;upported by the Tories, and the Whigs propo&s;ed Mr. John Smith, who was elected by a majority of forty-three voices. The queen in her &s;peech repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of acting vigorou&s;ly again&s;t France, as a common enemy to the liberties of Europe: &s;he commended the fortitude of the duke of Savoy, which &s;he &s;aid was without example: &s;he told them her intention was to expedite commi&s;&s;ions for treating of an union with Scot|land: &s;he earne&s;tly recommended an union of minds and affections among her people: &s;he ob&s;erved, that &s;ome per&s;ons had endeavoured to foment animo&s;i|ties, and even &s;ugge&s;ted in print, that the e&s;tabli&s;hed church was in danger: &s;he affirmed that &s;uch people were enemies to her and to the kingdom, and meaned only to cover de&s;igns which they dur&s;t not publicly own, by endea|vouring to di&s;tract the nation with unrea&s;onable and groundle&s;s di&s;tru&s;ts and jealou&s;ies: &s;he declared &s;he would always affectionately &s;upport and countenance the church of England, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed: that &s;he would inviolably main|tain the toleration: that &s;he would promote religion and virtue, encourage trade, and every thing el&s;e that might make them a happy and flouri&s;hing people.</P>

<P>The majority in both hou&s;es now profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame principles, and were well di&s;po&s;ed to &s;upport the queen in all her de&s;igns. They fir&s;t pre|&s;ented the u&s;ual addre&s;&s;es, in the warme&s;t terms of duty and affection. Then the commons drew up a &s;econd, a&s;&s;uring her they would, to the utmo&s;t of their power, a&s;&s;i&s;t her in bringing the treaty of union to a happy conclu&s;ion. They de&s;ired that the proceedings of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, relating to the union and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, might be laid before the hou&s;e. The lords had &s;olli|cited the &s;ame &s;atisfaction; and her maje&s;ty promi&s;ed to comply with their reque&s;t. The lower-hou&s;e having heard and decided in &s;ome ca&s;es of controverted elections, proceeded to take into con&s;ideration the e&s;timates for the &s;ervice of the en|&s;uing year, and granted the &s;upplies without he&s;itation. In the hou&s;e of lords, while the queen was pre&s;ent, lord Haver&s;ham, at the end of a long &s;peech, in which he reflected upon the conduct of the duke of Marlborough, both on the Mo&s;elle and in Brabant, moved for an addre&s;s to de&s;ire her maje&s;ty would invite the pre&s;umptive heir to the crown of England, to come and re&s;ide in the kingdom. This motion was earne&s;tly &s;upported by the duke of Bucking|ham, the earls of Roche&s;ter, Nottingham, and Angle&s;ey. They &s;aid there was no method &s;o effectual to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as that of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or's being upon the &s;pot, ready to a&s;&s;ume and maintain his or her right again&s;t any pretender; and they ob&s;erved, that in former times, when the throne of England was vacant, the fir&s;t comer had always &s;ucceeded in his preten&s;ions. The propo&s;al was vehemently oppo&s;ed by the Whigs, who knew
<PB N="309" REF="3120">
it was di&s;agreeable to the queen, whom they would not venture to di&s;oblige. They argued, that a rivalry between the two courts might produce di&s;tractions, and be attended with very ill con&s;equences; and ob&s;erved, that the prince&s;s Sophia had expre&s;&s;ed a full &s;atisfaction in the a&s;&s;urances of the queen, who had promi&s;ed to maintain her title. The que&s;tion being put, was carried in the negative by a great majority. The de&s;ign of the Tories in making this mo|tion, was to bring the other party in di&s;grace, either with the queen or with the people. Their joining in the mea&s;ure would have given umbrage to their &s;overeign; and, by oppo&s;ing it, they ran the ri&s;que of incurring the public odium, as enemies to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: but the pretence of the Tories was &s;o thin, the nation &s;aw through it; and the &s;ole effect the motion pro|duced, was the queen's re&s;entment again&s;t the whole party. Burner, bi&s;hop of Sarum, propo&s;ed that provi&s;ion might be made for maintaining the public quiet, in the interval between the queen's decea&s;e, and the arrival of her &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or: the motion was &s;econded by the lord-trea&s;urer; and a bill brought in for the better &s;ecurity of her maje&s;ty's per&s;on and government, and of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England. By this act, a regency was appointed of the &s;even per&s;ons that &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the offices of archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, lord chancellor or lord-keeper, lord-trea&s;urer, lord-pre&s;ident, lord privy-&s;eal, lord high-admiral, and the lord-chief-ju&s;tice of the queen's-bench. Their bu&s;ine&s;s was to proclaim the next &s;ucce&s;&s;or through the kingdom of England, and join with a certain number of per&s;ons named as regents by the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in three li&s;ts, to be &s;ealed up and depo&s;ited with the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the lord-keeper, and the mini&s;ter re&s;identiary of Hanover. It was enacted, That the&s;e joint re|gencies &s;hould conduct the admini&s;tration; and that the la&s;t parliament, even though di&s;&s;olved, &s;hould rea&s;&s;emble, and continue &s;itting for &s;ix months after the decea&s;e of her maje&s;ty. The bill met with a warm oppo&s;ition from the Tories, and did not pa&s;s the upper-hou&s;e without a prote&s;t. It was &s;till further ob&s;tructed in the hou&s;e of commons even by &s;ome of the Whig party, who were given to under&s;tand that the prince&s;s Sophia had expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to re|&s;ide in England. Exceptions were likewi&s;e taken to that clau&s;e in the bill, enacting that the la&s;t parliament &s;hould be rea&s;&s;embled. They affirmed, that this was incon&s;i&s;tent with part of the act by which the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was at fir&s;t &s;ettled; for, among other limitations, the parliament had provided, that when the crown &s;hould devolve to the hou&s;e of Hanover, no man, who had either place or pen&s;ion, &s;hould be capable of &s;itting in the hou&s;e of commons. After tedious di&s;putes and zealous altercation, they agreed that a certain number of offices &s;hould be &s;pecified as di&s;qualifying places. This &s;elf-denying clau&s;e, and &s;ome other amendments, produced conferences between the two hou&s;es, and at length the bill pa&s;&s;ed by their mutual a&s;&s;ent. Lord Haver&s;ham moved for an inquiry into the mi&s;carriages of the la&s;t campaign, hoping to find &s;ome foundation for cen&s;ure in the conduct of the duke of Marlborough. But the propo&s;al was rejected as invidious; and the two hou&s;es pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the queen, de&s;iring &s;he would pre&s;erve a good corre&s;pondence among all the confederates. They likewi&s;e concurred in repealing the act by which the Scots had been alienated, and all the northern counties alarmed with the apprehen&s;ion of a rupture between the two nations. The lord Shannon and brigadier Stanhope arriving with an account of the expedition to Catalonia,

the queen communicated the good news in a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, expre&s;&s;ing her hope that they would enable her to pro&s;ecute the advantages which her arms had acquired. The commons were &s;o well plea&s;ed with the tidings, that they forthwith granted two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds for her ma|je&s;ty's proportion in the expence of pro&s;ecuting the &s;ucce&s;&s;es already gained by king Charles III. for the recovery of the monarchy of Spain to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. On the fifteenth day of November, the queen gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to an act for exhibiting a bill to naturalize the prince&s;s Sophia, and the i&s;&s;ue of her body.</P>

<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures being taken, the &s;ixth day of December was ap|pointed for enquiring into tho&s;e dangers to which the Tories affirmed the church was expo&s;ed; and the queen attended in per&s;on to hear the debates on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject. The earl of Roche&s;ter compared the expre&s;&s;ions in the queen's &s;peech at the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, to the law enacted in the reign of Charles II. denouncing the penalties of trea&s;on again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould call the king a papi&s;t: for which rea&s;on, he &s;aid, he always thought him of that per&s;ua&s;ion. He affirmed, that the church's danger aro&s;e from the act of &s;ecurity in Scotland, the ab&s;ence of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown, and the practice of occa&s;ional conformity. He was an&s;wered by lord Hallifax, who, by way of recrimination, ob&s;erved, that king Charles II. was a roman catholic, at lea&s;t his brother declared him a papi&s;t after his death: that his brother and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or was a known roman catholic, yet the church thought her&s;elf &s;ecure; and tho&s;e patriots who &s;tood up in its defence were di&s;countenanced and pu|ni&s;hed: nay, when that &s;ucce&s;&s;or a&s;cended the throne, and the church was apparently in the mo&s;t imminent danger, by the high commi&s;&s;ion court and otherwi&s;e, the nation was then indeed generally alarmed; and every body knew who &s;at in that court, and entered deeply into the mea&s;ures which were then pur&s;ued. Compton bi&s;hop of London declared that the church was in danger, from profanene&s;s, irreligon, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s. He complained, that &s;ermons were preached wherein rebellion was counte|nanced, and re&s;i&s;tance to the higher powers encouraged. He alluded to a &s;ermon preached before the lord mayor, by Mr. Hoadley, now bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter. Burnet of Sarum &s;aid the bi&s;hop of London was the la&s;t man who ought to complain of that &s;ermon; for if the doctrine it contained was not good, he did not know what defence his lord&s;hip could make for his appear|ing in arms at Nottingham. He affirmed the church would be always &s;ubject to profanene&s;s and irreligion; but that they were not now &s;o flagrant as they u&s;ually had been: he thought the &s;ociety &s;et up for reformation in London, and other cities, had contributed con&s;iderably to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice; and he was &s;ure the corporation for propagating the go&s;pel had done a great deal towards in&s;tructing men in religion, by giving great numbers of books in practical divinity; by erecting libraries in country pari&s;hes; by &s;ending many able divines to the foreign plantations, and founding &s;chools to breed up chil|dren in the chri&s;tian knowledge; though to this expence very little had been contributed by tho&s;e who appeared &s;o wonderfully zealous for the church. The archbi&s;hop of York expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion of danger from the in|crea&s;e of di&s;&s;enters; particularly from the many academies they had in&s;tituted: he moved that the judges might be con&s;ulted with re&s;pect to the laws that were in force again&s;t &s;uch &s;eminaries, and by what means they might be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed.
<PB N="311" REF="3140">
Lord Wharton moved that the judges might al&s;o be con&s;ulted about means of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;chools and &s;eminaries held by nonjurors; in one of which the &s;ons of a noble lord in that hou&s;e had been educated. To this &s;arca&s;m the archbi&s;hop replied, that his &s;ons were indeed taught by Mr. Ellis, a &s;ober, vir|tuous man; but when he refu&s;ed the oath of abjuration, they were immediately withdrawn from his in&s;tructions. Lord Wharton proceeded to declare, that he had carefully peru&s;ed a pamphlet intitled "The Memorial," which was &s;aid to contain a demon&s;tration that the church was in danger; but all he could learn was, that the duke of Buckingham, the earls of Roche&s;ter and Notting|ham, were out of place: that he remembered &s;ome of the&s;e noblemen &s;at in the high-commi&s;&s;ion court, and then made no complaint of the church's being in danger. Patrick bi&s;hop of Ely complained of the heat and pa&s;&s;ion manife&s;ted by the gentlemen belonging to the univer&s;ities; and of the un|dutiful behaviour of the clergy towards their bi&s;hops. He was &s;econded by Hough of Litchfield and Coventry, who added, that the inferior clergy ca|lumniated their bi&s;hops, as if they were in a plot to de&s;troy the church, and had compounded to be the la&s;t of their order. Hooper of Bath and Wells ex|patiated on the invidious di&s;tinction implied in the terms "High church," and "Low church." The duke of Leeds a&s;&s;erted, that the church could not be &s;afe, without an act again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity. Lord Somers recapitulated all the arguments which had been u&s;ed on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion: he de|clared his own opinion was, that the nation was happy under a wi&s;e and ju&s;t admini&s;tration: that for men to rai&s;e groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies at that juncture, could mean no le&s;s than an intention to embroil the people at home, and defeat the glorious de&s;igns of the allies abroad. The debate being fini&s;hed, the que&s;tion was put, Whether the church of England was in danger? and carried in the negative by a great majority: then the hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, which was re&s;cued from the extreme&s;t danger by king William III. of glorious memory, is now, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, under the happy reign of her maje&s;ty, in a mo&s;t &s;afe and flouri&s;hing condition; and that whoever goes about to &s;ugge&s;t or in&s;inuate that the church is in danger, under her maje&s;ty's admini&s;tration, is an enemy to the queen, the church, and the kingdom. Next day, the commons concurred in this determination, and joined the lords in an addre&s;s to the queen, communicating this re&s;olution, be&s;eech|ing her to take effectual mea&s;ures for making it public; and al&s;o for puni&s;h|ing the authors and &s;preaders of the &s;editious and &s;candalous reports of the church's being in danger. She accordingly i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, containing the re&s;olution of the two hou&s;es, and offering a reward for di&s;covering the author of the memorial of the church of England, and for apprehending David Edwards, a profe&s;&s;ed papi&s;t, charged upon oath to be the printer and publi&s;her of that libel.</P>

<P>After a &s;hort adjournment, a committee of the lower-hou&s;e pre|&s;ented the thanks of the commons to the duke of Marlborough, for his great &s;ervices performed to her maje&s;ty and the nation in the la&s;t campaign, and for his prudent negotiations with her allies. This nobleman was in &s;uch credit with the people, that when he propo&s;ed a loan of five hundred thou&s;and pounds to the emperor, upon a branch of his revenue in Sile&s;ia, the money was ad|vanced immediately by the merchants of London. The kingdom was ble&s;&s;ed

with plenty: the queen was univer&s;ally beloved: the people in general were zealous for the pro&s;ecution of the war: the forces were well payed: the trea&s;ury was punctual; and, though a great quantity of coin was exported for the maintenance of the war, the paper-currency &s;upplied the deficiency &s;o well, that no murmurs were heard, and the public credit flouri&s;hed both at home and abroad. All the funds being e&s;tabli&s;hed, one in particular, for two millions and a half by way of annuities, for ninety-nine years, at &s;ix and a half per cent$ and all the bills having received the royal a&s;&s;ent, the queen went to the hou&s;e of peers on the nineteenth day of March, where having thanked both hou&s;es for the repeated in&s;tances of their affection which &s;he had received, &s;he prorogued the parliament to the twenty$fir&s;t day of May following<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other bi$$s pa&s;&s;ed during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was an act for abridging and reforming &s;ome proceedings in the common law and in chancery.</NOTE>.

The upper-hou&s;e having drawn up a warm addre&s;s of thanks to the queen, for her affectionate care of the church, the lower-hou&s;e refu&s;ed to concur; nor would they give any rea&s;on for their di&s;&s;ent. They prepared another in a different<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Bover. Lo$khart. Q$inc$. $word$ of Eu|rope. Fe$quieres. Tindal. Hi$$. of the D$ of Marlbo|r$ugh. B$rchet. L$ves of the Admir$ls.

Then they agreed to divers re|&s;olutions, a&s;&s;erting their right of having what they offered to the upper-hou&s;e received by his grace and their lord&s;hips. In con&s;equence of this di&s;&s;en&s;ion the addre&s;s was dropped, and a &s;top put to all further communication between the two hou&s;es. The dean of Peterborough prote&s;ted again&s;t the irregularities of the lower-hou&s;e. The queen, in a letter to the archbi&s;hop, &s;ignified her re&s;olu|tion to maintain her &s;upremacy, and the due &s;ubordination of pre&s;byters to bi&s;hops. She expre&s;&s;ed her hope that he and his &s;uffragans &s;hould act con|formably to her re&s;olution, in which ca&s;e they might be a&s;&s;ured of the continuance of her f$vour and protection: &s;he required him to impart this declaration to the bi&s;hops and clergy, and to prorogue the convocation to &s;uch time as &s;hould appear mo&s;t convenient. When he communicated this letter to the lower-hou&s;e, the members were not a little confounded; neverthele&s;s, they would not comply with the prorogation, but continued to &s;it in defiance of her ma|je&s;ty's plea&s;ure.</P>

in the council-chamber of the Cockpit near Whitehall, which was the place appointed for the conferences. Their commi&s;&s;ions being opened and read by the re&s;pective &s;ecretaries, and introductory &s;peeches being pronounced by the lord-keeper of England and the lord-chancellor of Scotland, they agreed to certain preliminary articles, importing, That all the propo&s;als &s;hould be made in writing, and every point, when agreed, reduced to writing: That no points &s;hould be obligatory, till all matters &s;hould be adju&s;ted in &s;uch a manner as would be proper to be laid before the queen and the two parliaments for their approbation: That a committee &s;hould be appointed from each commi&s;&s;ion to revi&s;e the minutes of what might pa&s;s, before they &s;hould be in&s;erted in the books by the re&s;pective &s;ecretaries; and that all the proceedings during the treaty &s;hould be kept &s;ecret. The Scots were inclined to a foederal union, like that of the United Provinces: but the Engli&s;h were bent upon an incorpora|tion, &s;o as that no Scotti&s;h parliament &s;hould ever have power to repeal the ar|ticles of the treaty. The lord-keeper propo&s;ed, that the two kingdoms of England and Scotland &s;hould be for ever united into one realm, by the name of Great-Britain: That it &s;hould be repre&s;ented by one and the &s;ame parliament; and, That the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of this monarchy, failing heirs of her maje&s;ty's body, &s;hould be according to the limitations mentioned in the act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of king William, intituled, An act for the further limitation of the crown, and the better &s;ecuring the rights and liberties of the &s;ubject. The Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, in order to comply in &s;ome mea&s;ure with the po|pular clamour of their nation, pre&s;ented a propo&s;al, implying that the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Scotland &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the &s;ame per&s;ons mentioned in the act of king William's reign: That the &s;ubjects of Scotland &s;hould for ever enjoy all the rights and privileges of the natives in England, and the dominions thereunto belonging; and, That the &s;ubjects of England &s;hould enjoy the like rights and privileges in Scotland: That there &s;hould be a free communication and intercour&s;e of trade and navigation between the two kingdoms, and plantations thereunto belonging; and that all laws and &s;tatutes in either kingdom, contrary to the terms of this union, &s;hould be repealed. The Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners declined entering into any con&s;iderations upon the&s;e propo&s;als, declaring them&s;elves fully convinced that nothing but an intire union would &s;ettle perfect and la&s;ting friend&s;hip between the two kingdoms. The Scots acquie&s;ced in this reply, and both &s;ides proceeded in the treaty, with|out any other intervening di&s;pute.

<P>WHILE $word$ treaty was on the $word$ at home, the allied arms pr$$pered $word$ in the $word$ in Spain, and in Pied|m$nt. The French king had re&s;olved to make very con&s;ider|able efforts in the&s;e cou$tr$$s; and indeed, at the beginning of the campaign his armies were very formidable.

nobleman repaired to Holland in the latter end of April; and conferred with the &s;tates-general. Then he a&s;&s;embled the army between Borchloen and Groe&s;-Waren, and found it amounted to &s;eventy-four battalions of foot, and one hundred and twenty-three &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons, well furni&s;hed with artillery and pontoons. The court of France having received intelligence, that the Dani&s;h and Pru&s;&s;ian troops had not yet joined the confederates, ordered the elector of Bavaria and the marechal de Villeroy to attack them before the junc|tion could be effected. In pur&s;uance of this order they pa&s;&s;ed the Deule on the nineteenth day of May, and po&s;ted them&s;elves at Tirlemont, being &s;uperior in number to the allied army. There they were joined by the hor&s;e of the army, commanded by marechal Mar&s;in, and encamped between Tirlemont and Ju|doigne. On Whit&s;unday, early in the morning, the duke of Marlborough advanced with his army in eight columns towards the village of Ramillies, being by this time joined by the Danes; and, he learned, that the enemy were in march to give him battle. Next day the French generals perceiving the con|federates &s;o near them, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong camp, their right extending to the Tomb of Hautemont on the &s;ide of the Mehaigne; their left to Ander|kirk; and, the village of Ramillies being near their center. The confederate army was drawn up in order of battle, with the right wing near Foltz on the brook of Yau&s;e, and the left by the village of Franquenies, which the enemy had occupied. The duke ordered lieutenant-general Schultz, with twelve battalions and twenty pieces of cannon to begin the action, by attacking Ramillies, which was &s;trongly fortified with artillery. At the &s;ame time velt|marechal Overkirk, on the left, commanded colonel Wertmuller, with four battalions and two pieces of cannon, to di&s;lodge the enemy's infantry po&s;ted among the hedges of Franquenies. Both the&s;e orders were &s;ucce&s;sfully exe|cuted. The Dutch and Dani&s;h hor&s;e of the left wing charged with great vi|gour and intrepidity; but were &s;o roughly handled by the troops of the French king's hou&s;hold, that they began to give way, when the duke of Marlborough &s;u&s;tained them with the body of re&s;erve, and twenty &s;quadrons drawn from the right, where a mora&s;s prevented them from acting. In the mean time, he in per&s;on rallied &s;ome of the broken &s;quadrons, in order to renew the charge, when his own hor&s;e falling, he was &s;urrounded by the enemy, and mu&s;t have been either killed or taken pri&s;oner, had not a body of infantry come &s;ea&s;onably to his relief. When he remounted his hor&s;e, the head of colonel Brienfield, his gentleman of the hor&s;e, was carried off by a cannon-ball while he held the duke's &s;tirrup. Before the reinforcement arrived, the be&s;t part of the French mou&s;quetaires were cut in pieces. All the troops po&s;ted in Ramillies were either killed or taken. The re&s;t of the enemy's infantry began to retreat in to|lerable order, under cover of the cavalry on their left wing, which formed them&s;elves in three lines between O&s;&s;uz and Anderkirk; but, the Engli&s;h hor&s;e having found means to pa&s;s the rivulet which divided them from the enemy, &s;ell upon them with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that they abandoned their foot, and were terribly &s;laughtered in the village of Anderkirk. They now gave way on all &s;ides. The hor&s;e fled three different ways; but, were &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, that very few e&s;caped. The elector of Bavaria and the marechal de Vill$roy &s;aved them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t difficulty. Several waggons of the enemy's vanguard breaking down in a narrow pa&s;s, ob&s;tructed the way in &s;uch a manner,
<PB N="318" REF="3210">
that the baggage and artillery could not proceed; nor could their troops defile in order. The victorious hor&s;e being informed of this accident, pre&s;&s;ed on them &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that great numbers threw down their arms and &s;ubmitted. The pur&s;uit was followed thro' Judoigne till two o'clock in the morning, five leagues from the field of battle, and within two of Louvaine. In a word, the confederates obtained a complete victory. They took the enemy's baggage and artillery, about one hundred and twenty colours or &s;tandards, &s;ix hundred officers, &s;ix thou&s;and private &s;oldiers; and about eight thou&s;and were killed or wounded. Prince Maximilian, and prince Monba&s;on lo&s;t their lives; the major-generals Palavicini and Mezieres were taken, together with the marqui&s;&s;es de Bar, de Nonant, and de la Baume, &s;on of the marechal de Tallard, mon&s;ieur de Montmorency, nephew to the duke of Luxembourg; and many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The lo&s;s of the allies did not exceed three thou&s;and men, including prince Lewis of He&s;&s;e and Mr. Bentinck, who were &s;lain in the engagement. The French generals retired with precipitation to Bru&s;&s;els, while the allies took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Louvaine, and next day encamped at Bethlem. The battle of Ra|millies was attended with the immediate conque&s;t of all Brabant. The cities of Louvaine, Mechlin, Bru&s;&s;els, Antwerp, Ghent, and Bruges, &s;ubmitted with|out re&s;i&s;tance, and acknowledged king Charles. O&s;tend, though &s;ecured by a &s;trong garri&s;on, was &s;urrendered after a &s;iege of ten days. Menin, e&s;teemed the mo&s;t fini&s;hed fortification in the Netherlands, and guarded by &s;ix thou&s;and men, met with the &s;ame fate. The garri&s;on of Dendermonde &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war; and Aeth &s;ubmitted on the &s;ame conditions. The French troops were di&s;pirited. The city of Paris was overwhelmed with con&s;ternation: Lewis affected to bear his misfortunes with calmne&s;s and compo&s;ure: but, the con&s;traint had &s;uch an effect upon his con&s;titution, that his phy&s;icians thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;cribe frequent bleeding, which he accordingly underwent. At his court no mention was made of military tran&s;actions: all was &s;olemn, &s;ilent, and re&s;erved.</P>

<P>Had the i&s;&s;ue of the campaign in Catalonia been &s;uch as the begin|$ing &s;eemed to progno&s;ticate, the French king might have in &s;ome mea&s;ure con|$oled him&s;elf for his di&s;graces in the Netherlands. On the &s;ixth day of April King Phi$ip, at the head of a numerous army, undertook the &s;iege of Barcelona, while the count de Thoulou&s;e blocked it up with a powerful &s;quadron. The inha|bitants, animated by the pre&s;ence of king Charles, made a vigorous defence; and, the garri&s;on was reinforced with &s;ome troops from Gironne and other places. But, after the &s;ort of Montjuic was taken, the place was &s;o hard pre&s;&s;ed, that Charles ran the utmo&s;t ri&s;que of falling into the hands of the enemy; for, the earl of Peterborough, who had marched from Valencia with two thou&s;and men, found it impracticable to enter the city. Neverthele&s;s, he maintained his po&s;t upon the hills; and, with &s;urpri&s;ing courage and activity kept the be&s;iegers in continual alarm. At length, Sir John Leake &s;ailed from Li&s;bon with thirty &s;hips of the line; and, on the eighth day of May arrived in &s;ight of Barcelona. The French admiral no &s;ooner received intelligence of his approach, than he &s;et &s;ail for Toulon. In three days after his departure king Philip abandoned the &s;iege, and retired in great di&s;order, leaving behind his tents, with the &s;ick and wounded. On the &s;ide of Portugal the duke of Berwick was left with &s;uch an incon&s;iderable force as proved in&s;ufficient to defend the frontiers. The earl of
<PB N="319" REF="3220">
Galway, with an army of twenty thou&s;and men, undertook the &s;iege of Alcantara; and, in three days the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of four thou&s;and men, were made pri|&s;oners of war. Then he marched to Placentia, and advanced as far as the bridge of Almaras; but, the Portugue&s;e would penetrate no farther until they &s;hould know the fate of Barcelona. When they under&s;tood the &s;iege was rai&s;ed, they con&s;ented to proceed to Madrid. Philip, gue&s;&s;ing their intention, po&s;ted to that capital, and &s;ent his queen with all his valuable effects to Burgos, whither he followed her in per&s;on, after having de&s;troyed every thing that he could not carry away. About the latter end of June the earl of Galway entered the city without re&s;i&s;tance; but, the Spaniards were extremely mortified to &s;ee an army of Portugu&s;e, headed by an heretic, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their capital. King Charles loitered away his time in Barcelona, until his competitor recovered his &s;pirits, and received &s;uch reinforcements as enabled him to return to Madrid, with an army equal to that commanded by the earl of Galway. This general made a motion towards Arragon, in order to facilitate his conjunction with Charles, who had &s;et out by the way of Sarago&s;&s;a, where he was acknowledged as &s;overeign of Arragon and Valencia. In the beginning of Augu&s;t he arrived at the Por|tugue&s;e camp, with a &s;mall reinforcement; and, in a few days was followed by the earl of Peterborough, at the head of five hundred dragoons. The two armies were now pretty equal in point of number; but, as each expected further reinforcements, neither cho&s;e to hazard an engagement. The earl of Peter|borough, who a&s;pired to the chief command, and hated the prince of Lich|ten&s;tein, who enjoyed the confidence of king Charles, retired in di&s;gu&s;t; and, embarking on board of an Engli&s;h &s;hip of war, &s;et &s;ail for Genoa. The Eng|li&s;h fleet continued all the &s;ummer in the Mediterranean: they &s;ecured Cartha|gena, which had declared for Charles: they took the town of Alicant by a&s;&s;ault, and the ca&s;tle by capitulation. Then &s;ailing out of the Streights, one &s;quadron was detached to the We&s;t-Indies, another order to lie at Li&s;bon, and the re&s;t were &s;ent home to England.</P>

<P>Fortune was not more propitious to the French in Italy than in Flan|ders. The duke of Vendome having been called to a&s;&s;ume the command in Flanders after the battle of Ramillies, the duke of Orleans was placed at the head of the army in Piedmont, under the tutorage and direction of the mare|chal de Mar&s;in. They were ordered to be&s;iege Turin, which was accordingly inve&s;ted in the month of May; and, the operations carried on till the beginning of September. Great preparations had been made for this &s;iege. It was not undertaken until the duke of Savoy had rejected all the offers of the French monarch, which were &s;ufficient to have &s;haken a prince of le&s;s cou|rage and fortitude. The duke de la Feuillade having fini&s;hed the lines of circum|vallation and contravallation, &s;ent his quarter-ma&s;ter general with a trumpet, to offer pa&s;&s;ports and a guard for the removal of the dutche&s;s and her children. The duke of Savoy replied, that he did not intend to remove his family; and, that the marechal might begin to execute his ma&s;ter's orders whenever he &s;hould think fit: but, when the &s;iege began with uncommon fury, and the French fired red-hot balls into the place, the two dutche&s;&s;es, with the young prince and prin|ce&s;&s;es, quitted Tur$n, and retired to Quiera&s;co, from whence they were cond$cted through many dangers into the territories of Genoa. The duke him&s;elf for&s;ook his capital, in order to put him&s;elf at the head of his cavalry; and, was pur&s;ued
<PB N="320" REF="3230">
from place to place by five and forty &s;quadrons, under the command of the count D'Aubeterre. Notwith&s;tanding the very noble defence which was made by the garri&s;on of Turin, who de&s;troyed fourteen thou&s;and of the enemy during the cour&s;e of the &s;iege, the defences were almo&s;t ruined, their ammunition began to fail, and they had no pro&s;pect of relief but from prince Eugene, who had numberle&s;s difficulties to encounter before he could march to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The duke of Vendome, before he left Italy, had &s;ecured all the fords of the Adige, the Mincio, and the Oglio, and formed &s;uch lines and intrenchments as he imagined would effectually hinder the Imperial general from arriving in time to relieve the city of Turin. But the prince &s;urmounted all oppo&s;ition, pa&s;&s;ed four great rivers in de&s;pite of the enemy; and reached the neighbourhood of Turin on the thirteenth day of Augu&s;t. There being joined by the duke of Savoy, he pa&s;&s;ed the Po between Montcalier and Cavignan. On the fifth day of Sep|tember they took a convoy of eight hundred loaded mules: next day they pa&s;&s;ed the Doria, and encamped with the right on the bank of that river before Pia|ne&s;&s;a, and the left on the Stura before the Veneria. The enemy were intrenched, having the Stura on their right, the Doria on their left, and the convent of ca|puchins, called Notre Dame de la Campagne, in their center. When prince Eugene approached Turin, the duke of Orleans propo&s;ed to march out of the intrench|ments, and give him battle; and this propo&s;al was &s;econded by all the general-officers, except Mar&s;in, who, finding the duke determined, produced an order from the French king, commanding the duke to follow the marechal's advice. The court of Ver&s;ailles was now become afraid of hazarding an engagement again&s;t tho&s;e who had &s;o often defeated their armies; and this officer had pri|vate in&s;tructions to keep within the trenches. On the &s;eventh day of September the confederates marched up to the intrenchments of the French, in eight co|lumns, through a terrible fire from forty pieces of artillery, and were formed in order of battle within half-cannon &s;hot of the enemy. Then they advanced to the attack with &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;olution, and met with &s;uch a warm reception as &s;eemed to &s;top their progre&s;s. Prince Eugene perceiving this check, drew his &s;word, and putting him&s;elf at the head of the battalions on the left, forced the intrenchments at the fir&s;t charge. The duke of Savoy met with the &s;ame &s;uc|ce&s;s in the center, and on the right near Lu&s;cingo. The hor&s;e advanced thro' the intervals of the foot, le$t for that purpo&s;e; and breaking in with va&s;t impe|tuo&s;ity, completed the confu&s;ion of the enemy, who were defeated on all hands, and retired with precipitation to the other &s;ide of the Po, while the duke of Savoy entered his capital in triumph. The duke of Orleans exhibited repeated proofs of the mo&s;t intrepid courage; and received &s;everal wounds in the engage|ment. Marechal de Mar&s;in fell into the hands of the victors, his thigh being &s;hat|tered with a ball, and died in a few hours after the amputation. Of the French army about five thou&s;and men were &s;lain on the field of battle: a great number of officers, and upwards of &s;even thou&s;and men were taken, together with two hundred and fifty-five pieces of cannon, one hundred and eighty mortars, an incredible quantity of ammunition, all the tents and baggage, five thou&s;and bea&s;ts of burthen, ten thou&s;and hor&s;es belonging to thirteen regiments of dra|goons, and the mules of the commi&s;&s;ary-general &s;o richly laden, that this part of the booty alone was valued at three millions of livres. The lo&s;s of the confederates
<PB N="321" REF="3240">
did not exceed three thou&s;and men killed or di&s;abled in the action, be&s;ides about the &s;ame number of the garri&s;on of Turin, which had fallen &s;ince the beginning of the &s;iege. This was &s;uch a fatal &s;troke to the intere&s;t of Lewis, that madame de Maintenon would not venture to make him fully acquainted with the &s;tate of his affairs. He was told, that the duke of Orleans had rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Turin at the approach of prince Eugene; but he knew not that his own army was defeated and ruined. The &s;pirits of the French were a little comforted in con&s;equence of an advantage gained about this time, by the count de Medavy-grancey, who commanded a body of troops left in the Mantuan ter|ritories. He &s;urpri&s;ed the prince of He&s;&s;e in the neighbourhood of Ca&s;tiglione, and obliged him to retire to the Adige with the lo&s;s of two thou&s;and men; but this victory was attended with no con&s;equence in their favour. The duke of Orleans retreated into Dauphine, while the French garri&s;ons were driven out of every place they occupied in Piedmont and Italy, except Cremona, Valenza, and the ca&s;tle of Milan, which were blocked up by the confederates.</P>

<P>Over and above the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters which the French &s;u&s;tained in the cour&s;e of this campaign, they were mi&s;erably alarmed by the project of an inva&s;ion from Britain, formed by the marquis de Gui&s;card, who, actuated by a family-di&s;gu&s;t, had abandoned his country, and become a parti&s;an of the confederates. He was declared a lieutenant-general in the emperor's army, and came over to London, after having &s;ettled a corre&s;pondence with the malcontents in the &s;outhern parts of France. He in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the friend&s;hip of Henry St. John, &s;ecretary of war, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. His &s;cheme of in|vading France was approved by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try; and he was promoted to the command of a regiment of dragoons de&s;tined for that &s;ervice. About eleven thou&s;and men were embarked under the conduct of earl Rivers, with a large train of artillery; and the combined &s;quadrons, commanded by Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel, &s;et &s;ail from Plymouth on the thirteenth day of Augu&s;t. Next day they were forced into Torbay by contrary winds; and there they held a council of war to concert their operations, when they di&s;covered, that Gui&s;card's plan was altogether chimerical, or at lea&s;t founded upon &s;uch &s;light a&s;&s;urances and conjectures, as could not ju&s;tify their proceeding to execution. An expre&s;s was immediately di&s;patched to the admiralty, with the re&s;ult of this council; and, in the mean time, letters arrived at court from the earl of Galway, after his re|treat from Madrid to Valencia, &s;olliciting &s;uccours with the mo&s;t earne&s;t in|treaties. The expedition to France was immediately po&s;tponed; and Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel was ordered to make the be&s;t of his way for Li&s;bon, there to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as the &s;tate of the war in Spain &s;hould render nece&s;&s;ary. Gui&s;card and his officers being &s;et on &s;hore, the fleet &s;ailed with the fir&s;t fair wind, and towards the latter end of October arrived at Li&s;bon. On the twenty|eighth day of the next month the king of Portugal died, and his elde&s;t &s;on and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or being but eighteen years of age, was even more than his father influenced by a mini&s;try, which had private connexions with the court of Ver&s;ailles. Ne|verthele&s;s, Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel and earl Rivers, being pre&s;&s;ed by letters from king Charles and the earl of Galway, &s;ailed to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the beginning of January; and on the twenty-eighth arrived at Alicant, from whence the earl of Rivers proceeded by land to Valencia, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t at a general council of war. The operations of the en&s;uing campaign being concerted, and the

<P>Poland was at length delivered from the pre&s;ence of the king of Sweden, who in the beginning of September &s;uddenly marched through Lu&s;atia into Saxony; and in a little time layed that whole electorate under contribution. Augu&s;tus being thus cut off from all re&s;ource, re&s;olved to obtain peace on the Swede's own terms, and engaged in a &s;ecret treaty for this purpo&s;e. In the mean time the Poles and Mu&s;covites attacked the Swedi&s;h forces at Kali&s;h in Great Poland; and by dint of number routed them with great &s;laughter. Not|with&s;tanding this event, Augu&s;tus ratified the treaty, by which he acknow|ledged S$ani&s;laus as true and rightful king of Poland, re&s;erving to him&s;elf no more than the empty title of &s;overeign. The confederates were not a little alarmed to find Charles in the heart of Germany; and the French court did not &s;aid to court his alliance: but he continued on the re&s;erve again&s;t all their &s;ol|licitations. Then they implored his mediation for a peace; and he an&s;wered, that he would interpo&s;e his good offices, as &s;oon as he &s;hould know they would be agreeable to the powers engaged in the grand alliance.</P>

<P>The pride of Lewis was now humbled to &s;uch a degree as might have ex|cited the compa&s;&s;ion of his enemies. He employed the elector of Bavaria to write letters in his name to the duke of Marlborough and the deputies of the &s;tates-general, containing propo&s;als for opening a congre&s;s. He had already tampered with the Dutch, in a memorial pre&s;ented by the marquis D'Alegre. He likewi&s;e be&s;ought the pope to interpo&s;e in his behalf. He offered to cede either Spain and the We&s;t-Indies, or Milan, Naples, and Sicily to king Charles; to give up a barrier for the Dutch in the Netherlands; and to indemnify the duke of Savoy for the ravages that had been committed in his dominions. Though his real aim was peace, yet he did not de&s;pair of being able to excite &s;uch jealou&s;ies among the confederates, as might &s;hake the ba&s;is of their union. His hope was not altogether di&s;appointed. The court of Vienna was &s;o much alarmed at the offers he had made, and the reports circulated by his emi&s;&s;aries, that the emperor re&s;olved to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Naples before the allies &s;hould have it in their power to clo&s;e with the propo&s;als of France. This was the true mo|tive of his concluding a treaty with Lewis in the &s;ucceeding winter, by which the Milane&s;e was entirely evacuated, and the French king at liberty to employ tho&s;e troops in making &s;trong efforts again&s;t the confederates in Spain and the Nether|lands. The Dutch were intoxicated with &s;ucce&s;s, and their pen&s;ionary Hein&s;ius entirely influenced by the duke of Marlborough, who found his account in the continuance of the war, which at once gratified his avarice and ambition; for, all his great qualities were ob&s;cured by the &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ion of accumulating wealth. During the whole war the allies never had &s;uch an opportunity as they now enjoyed, to bridle the power of France effectually, and &s;ecure the liberties of the empire; and indeed, if their real de&s;ign was to e&s;tabli&s;h an equal ba|lance between the hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Bourbon, it could not have been better effected than by dividing the Spani&s;h monarchy between the&s;e two po|tentates. The acce&s;&s;ion of Spain, with all its appendages, to either, would have de&s;troyed the aequilibrium which the allies propo&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h. But, other motives contributed to a continuation of the war. The powers of the confederacy were fired with the ambition of making conque&s;ts; and England

in particular thought her&s;elf intitled to an indemnification for the immen&s;e &s;ums &s;he had expended. Animated by the&s;e concurring con&s;iderations, queen Anne and the &s;tates-general rejected the offers of France; and declared, that they would not enter into any negotiation for peace, except in concert with their allies.</P>

<P>The Tories of England began to meditate &s;chemes of oppo&s;ition again&s;t the duke of Marlborough. They looked upon him as a &s;elfi&s;h noble|man, who &s;acrificed the intere&s;t of the nation in protracting a ruinous war for his own private advantage. They &s;aw their country oppre&s;&s;ed with an increa&s;|ing load of taxes, which they apprehended would in a little time become an in|tolerable burden; and they did not doubt but at this period &s;uch terms might be obtained as would fully an&s;wer the great purpo&s;e of the confederacy. This, indeed, was the prevailing opinion among all the &s;en&s;ible people of the nation who were not particularly intere&s;ted in the pro&s;ecution of the war, either by being connected with the general, or in &s;ome &s;hape employed in the management of the finances. The Tories were likewi&s;e in&s;tigated by a party-&s;pirit again&s;t Marlborough, who, by means of his wife, was in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the queen's confidence, and openly patronized the Whig faction. But, the attention of people in general was now turned upon the Scotti&s;h parliament, which took into con&s;ideration the treaty of union lately concluded between the commi&s;&s;ioners of both king|doms. On the third day of October the duke of Queen&s;berry, as high-com|mi&s;&s;ioner, produced the queen's letter, in which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her hope, that the terms of the treaty would be acceptable to her parliament of Scotland. She &s;aid, an intire and perfect union would be the &s;olid foundation of a la&s;ting peace: it would &s;ecure their religion, liberty, and property, remove the animo&s;ities that prevailed among them&s;elves, and the jealou&s;ies that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two nations. It would increa&s;e their &s;trength, riches, and commerce: the whole i&s;land would be joined in affection, and free from all apprehen&s;ion of different intere&s;ts: it would be enabled to re&s;i&s;t all its enemies, &s;upport the prote&s;tant intere&s;t every where, and maintain the liberties of Europe. She renewed her a&s;&s;urance of maintaining the government of their church; and told them, that now they had an opportunity of taking &s;uch &s;teps as might be nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;ecurity after the union. She demanded the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. She ob&s;erved, that the great &s;ucce&s;s with which God Almighty had ble&s;&s;ed her arms, afforded the nearer pro&s;pect of a happy peace, with which they would enjoy the full advantages of this union; that they had no rea&s;on to doubt but the parlia|ment of England would do all that &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary on their part, to con|firm the union; and &s;he recommended calmne&s;s and unanimity in deliberat|ing on this great and weighty affair, of &s;uch con&s;equence to the whole i&s;land of Great-Britain.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Hitherto the articles of the union had been indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed from the knowledge of the people: but, the treaty being recited in parliament, and the particulars divulged, &s;uch a flame was kindled through the whole na|tion, as had not appeared &s;ince the re&s;toration. The cavaliers or Jacobites had always fore&s;een, that this union would extingui&s;h all their hopes of a revolution in favour of a pretender. The nobility found them&s;elves degraded in point of dignity and influence, by being excluded from their &s;eats in parliament. The trading part of the nation beheld their commerce &s;addled with heavy duties and re&s;trictions, and con&s;idered the privilege of trading to the Engli&s;h plantations
<PB N="324" REF="3270">
as a precarious and uncertain pro&s;pect of advantage. The barons or gentlemen were exa&s;perated at a coalition, by which their parliament was annihilated and their credit de&s;troyed. The people in general exclaimed, that the dignity of their crown was betrayed: that the independency of their nation had fallen a &s;acrifice to treachery and corruption: that whatever conditions might be &s;pe|ciou&s;ly offered, they could not expect they would be ob&s;erved by a parliament in which the Engli&s;h had &s;uch a majority. They exaggerated the dangers to which the con&s;titution of their church would be expo&s;ed from a bench of bi&s;hops, and a parliament of epi&s;copalians. This con&s;ideration alarmed the pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters to &s;uch a degree, that they employed all their power and credit in waking the re&s;entment of their hearers again&s;t the treaty, which produced an univer&s;al ferment among all ranks of people. Even the mo&s;t rigid puritans joined the cavaliers in expre&s;&s;ing their dete&s;tation of the union; and, laying a&s;ide their mutual animo&s;ities, promi&s;ed to co-operate in oppo&s;ing a mea&s;ure &s;o ignominious and prejudicial to their country. In parliament the oppo&s;ition was headed by the dukes of Hamilton and Athol, and the marquis of Annan|dale. The fir&s;t of the&s;e noblemen had wavered &s;o much in his conduct, that it is difficult to a&s;certain his real political principles. He was generally &s;up|po&s;ed to favour the claim of the pretender; but he was afraid of embarking too far in his cau&s;e, and avoided violent mea&s;ures in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this treaty, le&s;t he &s;hould incur the re&s;entment of the Engli&s;h parliament, and forfeit the e&s;tate he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in that kingdom. Athol was more forward in his profe&s;&s;ions of attachment to the court of St. Germain's; but, he had le&s;s ability, and his zeal was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been inflamed by re&s;entment again&s;t the mini&s;try. The debates upon the different articles of the treaty were carried on with great heat and vivacity; and many &s;hrewd arguments were u&s;ed again&s;t this &s;cheme of an incorporating union. One member affirmed, that it would furni&s;h a handle to any a&s;piring prince to overthrow the liberties of all Britain; for, if the parliament of Scotland could alter, or rather &s;ubvert its con&s;titution, this circum&s;tance might be a precedent for the parliament of Great-Britain to a&s;&s;ume the &s;ame power: that the repre&s;entatives for Scotland would, from their poverty, depend upon tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the means of corruption; and, having ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;o little concern for the &s;upport of their own con&s;titution, would pay very little regard to that of any other. <Q>&startq;What! (&s;aid the duke of Hamilton) &s;hall we in half an hour give up what our forefathers maintained with their lives and fortunes for many ages? Are here none of the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e worthy patriots, who defended the liberty of their country again&s;t all in|vaders; who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the great king Robert Bruce to re&s;tore the con&s;titu|tion, and revenge the fal&s;hood of England and u&s;urpation of Baliol? Where are the Dougla&s;&s;es and Campbells? Where are the peers, where are the ba|rons, once the bulwark of the nation? Shall we yield up the &s;overeignty and independency of our country, when we are commanded by tho&s;e we repre|&s;ent, to pre&s;erve the &s;ame, and a&s;&s;ured of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;upport us?&endq;</Q> The duke of Athol prote&s;ted again&s;t an incorporating union, as contrary to the ho|nour, intere&s;t, fundamental laws, and con&s;titution of the kingdom of Scotland, the birthright of the peers, the rights and privileges of the barons and bo|roughs, and to the claim of right, property, and liberty of the &s;ubjects. To this prote&s;t nineteen peers and forty-&s;ix commoners adhered. The earl mare&s;|chal entered a prote&s;t, importing, that no per&s;on being &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown
<PB N="325" REF="3280">
of England &s;hould inherit that of Scotland, without &s;uch previous limitations as might &s;ecure the honour and &s;overeignty of the Scotti&s;h crown and king|dom, the frequency and power of parliament, the religion, liberty, and trade of the nation, from Engli&s;h or any foreign influence. He was &s;econded by &s;ix and forty members. With regard to the third article of the union, &s;tipulating, that both kingdoms &s;hould be repre&s;ented by one and the &s;ame parliament, the country-party ob&s;erved, that by a&s;&s;enting to this expedient, they did in effect &s;ink their own con&s;titution, while that of England underwent no alteration: that in all nations there are fundamentals which no power whatever can alter: that the rights and privileges of parliament being one of the&s;e fundamentals among the Scots, no parliament, or any other power could ever legally prohibit the meeting of parliaments, or deprive any of the three e&s;tates of its right of &s;itting or voting in parliament, or give up the rights and privileges of parlia|ment: but, that by this treaty the parliament of Scotland was intirely abrogated, its rights and privileges &s;acrificed, and tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h parliament &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in their place. They argued, that though the legi&s;lative power in parlia|ment was regulated and determined by a majority of voices; yet the giving up the con&s;titution, with the rights and privileges of the nation, was not &s;ubject to &s;uffrage, being founded on dominion and property; and therefore could not be legally &s;urrendered without the con&s;ent of every per&s;on who had a right to elect and be repre&s;ented in parliament. They affirmed, that the obligation layed on the Scotti&s;h members to re&s;ide &s;o long in London in attendance on the Briti&s;h parliament, would drain Scotland of all its money, impoveri&s;h the members, and &s;ubject them to the temptation of being corrupted. Another prote&s;t was entered by the marquis of Annandale again&s;t an incorporating union, as being odious to the people, &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titution, &s;overeignty, and claim of right, and threatening ruin to the church as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. Fifty-two mem|bers joined in this prote&s;tation. Almo&s;t every article produced the mo&s;t inflam|matory di&s;putes. The lord Belhaven enumerated the mi&s;chiefs which would attend the union, in a pathetic &s;peech that drew tears from the audience, and is at this day looked upon as a prophecy by great part of the Scotti&s;h nation. Ad|dre&s;&s;es again&s;t the treaty were pre&s;ented to parliament by the convention of bo|roughs, the commi&s;&s;ioners of the general-a&s;&s;embly, the company trading to Africa and the Indies, as well as from &s;everal &s;hires, &s;tewartries, boroughs, towns, and pari&s;hes, in all the different parts of the kingdom, without di&s;tinc|tion of Whig or Tory, epi&s;copalian or pre&s;byterian. The earl of Buchan for the peers, Lockhart of Carnwath for the barons, Sir Walter Stuart in behalf of the peers, barons, and boroughs; the earls of Errol and Mare&s;chal for them&s;elves, as high-con&s;table and earl-mar&s;hal of the kingdom, prote&s;ted &s;everally again&s;t the treaty of union.</P>

<P>While this oppo&s;ition raged within doors, the re&s;entment of the people ro&s;e to tran&s;ports of fury and revenge. The more rigid pre&s;byterians, known by the name of Cameronians, cho&s;e officers, formed them&s;elves into regiments, provided hor&s;es, arms, and ammunition, and marching to Dumfries, burned the articles of the union at the market-cro&s;s, ju&s;tify|ing their conduct in a public declaration. They made a tender of their attachment to duke Hamilton, from whom they received encouragement in &s;ecret. They reconciled them&s;elves to the epi&s;copalians and the cavaliers.
<PB N="326" REF="3290">
They re&s;olved to take the route to Edinburgh, and di&s;&s;olve the parliament; while the duke of Athole undertook to &s;ecure the pa&s;s of Stirling with his Highlanders, &s;o as to open the communication between the we&s;tern and $orthern parts of the kingdom. Seven or eight thou&s;and men were actually ready to appear in arms at the town of Hamilton, and march directly to Edin|burgh $nder the duke's command; when that nobleman altered his opinion, and di&s;patched private couriers through the whole country, requiring the people to defer their meeting till further directions. The more &s;anguine ca|val$$rs accu&s;ed his grace of treachery; but in all likelihood he was actuated by prudential motives. He alledged, in his own excu&s;e, that the nation was not in a condition to carry on &s;uch an enterprize, e&s;pecially as the Engli&s;h had al|ready det$ched troops to the border, and might in a few days wa&s;t over a con&s;iderable reinforcement from Holland. During this commotion among the Cameronians, the cities of Edinburgh and Gla&s;gow were filled with tu|mults. Sir Patrick John&s;ton provo&s;t of Edinburgh, who had been one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for the union, was be&s;ieged in his own hou&s;e by the populace, and would have been torn in pieces, had not the guards di&s;per&s;ed the multi|tude. The privy-council i&s;&s;ued a proclamation again&s;t riots, commanding all per&s;ons to retire from the &s;treets whenever the drum &s;hould beat; ordering the guards to fire upon tho&s;e who &s;hould di&s;obey this command, and indemnify|ing them from all pro&s;ecution for maiming or &s;laying the lieges. The&s;e guards were placed all round the hou&s;e in which the peers and commons were a&s;|&s;embled, and the council received the thanks of the parliament for having thus provided for their &s;afety. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions of the govern|ment, the commi&s;&s;ioner was con&s;tantly &s;aluted with the cur&s;es and imprecations of the people as he pa&s;&s;ed along: his guards were pelted; and &s;ome of his at|tendants wounded with &s;tones as they &s;at by him in the coach, &s;o that he was obliged to pa&s;s through the &s;treets at the full gallop.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; X.</HEAD>
<P>Again&s;t all this national fury, the dukes of Queen&s;berry and Argyle, the earls of Montro&s;e, Seafield, and Stair, and the other noblemen attached to the union, acted with equal prudence and re&s;olution. They argued &s;tre|n$$u&s;ly again&s;t the objections that were &s;tarted in the hou&s;e. They magnified the advantages that would accrue to the kingdom from the privilege of trading to the Engli&s;h plantations, and being protected in their commerce by a powerful navy; as well as from the exclu&s;ion of a popi&s;h pretender, who they knew was odious to the nation in general. They found means, partly by their promi&s;es, and partly by corruption, to bring over the earls of Roxburgh and Marchmont, with the whole &s;quadrone, who had hitherto been unpropi|tious to the court. They di&s;armed the re&s;entment of the clergy, by promot|ing an act to be in&s;erted in the union, declaring the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline to be the only government of the church of Scotland, unalterable in all &s;uc|ceeding times, and a fundamental article of the treaty. They &s;oothed the African company with the pro&s;pect of being indemnified for the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u$$ained. They amu&s;ed individuals with the hope of &s;haring the re&s;t of the equivalent. They employed emi&s;&s;aries to allay the $erment among the Cameronians, and di&s;unite them from the cavaliers, by canting, praying, and demon&s;trating the ab&s;urdity, &s;infulne&s;s, and danger, of &s;uch a coalition. The&s;e remon&s;trances were reinforced by the &s;um of twenty thou&s;and pounds, which
<PB N="327" REF="3300">
the queen privately lent to the Scotti&s;h trea&s;ury, and which was now distri|buted by the mini&s;try in &s;uch a manner as might be&s;t conduce to the &s;ucce&s;s of the treaty. By the&s;e practices they dimini&s;hed, though they could not &s;ilence, the clamour of the people, and obtained a con&s;iderable majority in parliament, which out-voted all oppo&s;ition. Not but that the duke of Queen&s;|berry at one time de&s;paired of &s;ucceeding, and being in continual apprehen|&s;ion for his life, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of adjourning the parliament, until by time and good management he &s;hould be able to remove tho&s;e difficulties that then &s;eemed to be un&s;urmountable. But the lord-trea&s;urer Godolphin, who fore|&s;aw that the mea&s;ure would be intirely lo&s;t by delay, and was no judge of the difficulties, in&s;i&s;ted upon his proceeding. It was at this period that he re|mitted the money, and gave directions for having forces ready at a call, both in England and Ireland. At length the Scotti&s;h parliament approved and ra|tified all the articles of the union, with &s;ome &s;mall variation. Then they pre|pared an act for regulating the election of the &s;ixteen peers and forty-five com|moners to repre&s;ent Scotland in the Briti&s;h parliament. This being touched with the &s;ceptre, the three e&s;tates proceeded to elect their repre&s;entatives. The remaining part of the &s;e&s;&s;ion was employed in making regulations concerning the coin, in examining the accounts of their African company, and providing for the due application of the equivalent, which was &s;candalou&s;ly mi&s;applied$ On the twenty-fifth day of March the commi&s;&s;ioner adjourned the parlia|ment, after having in a &s;hort &s;peech taken notice of the honour they had acquired in concluding an affair of &s;uch importance to their country. Having thus accompli&s;hed the great purpo&s;e of the court, he &s;et out for London, in the neighbourhood of which he was met by above forty noble|men in their coaches, and about four hundred gentlemen on hor&s;eback. Next day he waited upon the queen at Kenfington, from whom he met with a very gracious reception. Perhaps there is not another in&s;tance upon record of a mini&s;try's having carried a point of this importance again&s;t &s;uch a violent torrent of oppo&s;ition, and contrary to the general &s;en&s;e and inclination of a whole exa&s;perated people. The Scots were per&s;uaded that their trade would be de&s;troyed, their nation oppre&s;&s;ed, and their country ruined, in con&s;equence of the union with England; and indeed their opinion was &s;upported by very plau&s;ible arguments. The majority of both nations believed that the treaty would produce violent convul&s;ions, or at be&s;t prove ineffectual. But we now &s;ee it has been attended with none of the calamities that were progno&s;ticated; that it quietly took effect, and fully an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es for which it was intended. Hence we may learn, that many great difficulties are &s;urmounted, becau&s;e they are not &s;een by tho&s;e who direct the operation; and that many &s;chemes which theory deems impracticable, will yet &s;ucceed in the experi|ment.</P>

<P>The Engli&s;h parliament a&s;&s;embling on the third day of December, the queen, in her &s;peech to both hou&s;es, congratulated them on the glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;es of her arms. She de&s;ired the commons would grant &s;uch &s;upplies as might enable her to improve the advantages of this &s;ucce&s;sful campaign. She told them that the treaty of union, as concluded by the commi&s;&s;ioners of both kingdoms, was at that time under the con&s;ideration of the Scotti&s;h parliament; and &s;he recommended di&s;patch in the public affairs, that both friends and enemies
<PB N="328" REF="3310">
might be convinced of the firmne&s;s and vigour of their proceedings. The parliament was perfectly well di&s;po&s;ed to comply with all her maje&s;ty's re|que&s;ts. Warm addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented by both hou&s;es. Then they pro|ceeded to the con&s;ideration of the &s;upply, and having examined the e&s;timates in le&s;s than a week, voted near &s;ix millions for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year. Neverthele&s;s, in examining the accounts, &s;ome objections aro&s;e. They found that the extraordinary &s;upplies for the &s;upport of king Charles of Spain, amounted to eight hundred thou&s;and pounds more than the &s;ums provided by parliament. Some members argued that very ill con&s;equences might en&s;ue, if a mini&s;try could thus run the nation in debt, and expect the parliament &s;hould pay the money. The courtiers an&s;wered, that if any thing had been rai&s;ed without nece&s;&s;ity or ill applied, it was rea&s;onable that tho&s;e who were in fault &s;hould be puni&s;hed: but, as this expence was incurred to improve advan|tages, at a time when the occa&s;ion could not be communicated to parliament, the mini&s;try was rather to be applauded for their zeal, than condemned for their liberality. The que&s;tion being put, the majority voted that tho&s;e &s;ums had been expended for the pre&s;ervation of the duke of Savoy, for the intere&s;t of king Charles again&s;t the common enemy, and for the &s;afety and honour of the na|tion. When the &s;peaker pre&s;ented the money-bills, he told her, that as the glorious victory obtained by the duke of Marlborough at Ramillies was fought before it could be &s;uppo&s;ed the armies were in the field, &s;o it was no le&s;s &s;ur|pri&s;ing that the commons had granted &s;upplies to her maje&s;ty, before the enemy could well know that the parliament was &s;itting. The general was again ho|noured with the thanks of both hou&s;es. The lords, in an addre&s;s, be&s;ought the queen to &s;ettle his honours on his po&s;terity. An act was pa&s;&s;ed for this purpo&s;e; and, in pur&s;uance of another addre&s;s from the commons, a pen&s;ion of five thou&s;and pounds out of the po&s;t-office was &s;ettled upon him and his de&s;cendents. The lords and commons having adjourned them&s;elves to the la&s;t day of December, the queen clo&s;ed the year with triumphal proce&s;&s;ions. As the &s;tandards and colours taken at Blenheim had been placed in We&s;tmin|&s;ter-hall, &s;o now tho&s;e that had been brought from the field of Ramillies were put up in Guildhall, as trophies of that victory. About this time, the earls of Kent, Lind&s;ey, and King&s;ton, were rai&s;ed to the rank of marqui&s;&s;es. The lords Wharton, Poulet, Godolphin, Cholmondely, were created earls. Lord Walden, &s;on and heir apparent to the earl of Suffolk, obtained the title of earl of Bindon; the lord-keeper Cowper and Sir Thomas Pelham were ennobled as barons.</P>

<P>The parliament being a&s;&s;embled after their &s;hort rece&s;s, the earl of Nottingham moved for an addre&s;s to the queen, de&s;iring her maje&s;ty would order the proceedings of the commi&s;&s;ioners for the union, as well as tho&s;e of the Scotti&s;h parliament on the &s;aid &s;ubject, to be laid before them. He was &s;econded by the duke of Buckingham and the earl of Roche&s;ter; and an&s;wered by the earl of Godolphin, who told them they needed not doubt but that her maje&s;ty would communicate tho&s;e proceedings, as &s;oon as the Scotti&s;h parlia|ment &s;hould have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject of the union. The lords Wharton, Somers, and Hallifax, ob&s;erved, that it was for the honour of the nation that the treaty of union &s;hould fir&s;t come ratified from the parliament of Scotland; and that then, and not before, it would be a proper time for the lords to take
<PB N="329" REF="3320">
it into con&s;ideration. On the twenty-eighth day of January, the queen in per&s;on told both hou&s;es, that the treaty of union, with &s;ome additions and alterations, was ratified by an act of the Scotti&s;h parliament: that &s;he had ordered it to be laid before them, and hoped it would meet with their con|currence and approbation. She de&s;ired the commons would provide for the payment of the equivalent, in ca&s;e the treaty &s;hould be approved. She ob|&s;erved to both hou&s;es, that now they had an opportunity of putting the la&s;t hand to a happy union of the two kingdoms; and that &s;he &s;hould look upon it as a particular happine&s;s, if this great work, which had been &s;o often at|tempted without &s;ucce&s;s, could be brought to perfection in her reign. When the commons formed them&s;elves into a committee of the whole hou&s;e, to de|liberate on the articles of the union, and the Scotti&s;h act of ratification, the Tory party, which was very weak in that a&s;&s;embly, began to &s;tart &s;ome ob|jections. Sir John Packington di&s;approved of this incorporating union, which he likened to a marriage with a woman again&s;t her con&s;ent. He &s;aid it was an union carried on by corruption and bribery within doors, by force and vio|lence without: that the promoters of it had ba&s;ely betrayed their tru&s;t, in giving up their independent con&s;titution, and he would leave it to the judg|ment of the hou&s;e, to con&s;ider whether or no men of &s;uch principles were fit to be admitted into their hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives. He ob&s;erved, that her maje&s;ty, by the coronation-oath, was obliged to maintain the church of Eng|land as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; and likewi&s;e bound by the &s;ame oath to defend the pre&s;byterian kirk of Scotland in one and the &s;ame kingdom. Now (&s;aid he) after this union is in force, who &s;hall admini&s;ter this oath to her maje&s;ty? It is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Scots, who are incapable of it, and no well-wi&s;hers to the church of England. It is then only the part of the bi&s;hops to do it; and can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that tho&s;e reverend per&s;ons will, or can act a thing &s;o con|trary to their own order and in&s;titution, as thus to promote the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the pre&s;byterian church-government in the united kingdom. He added, that the church of England being e&s;tabli&s;hed jure divino, and the Scots pre|tending that the kirk was al&s;o jure divino, he could not tell how two nations that cla&s;hed in &s;o e&s;&s;ential a point could unite: he therefore thought it proper to con&s;ult the convocation about this critical point. A motion was made, that the fir&s;t article of the treaty, which implies a peremptory agreement to an in|corporating union &s;hould be po&s;tponed; and that the hou&s;e &s;hould proceed to the con&s;ideration of the terms of the intended union, contained in the other articles. This propo&s;al being rejected, &s;ome Tory members quitted the hou&s;e; and all the articles were examined and approved without further oppo&s;ition. The Whigs were &s;o eager in the pro&s;ecution of this point, that they proceeded in a very &s;uperficial manner, and in &s;uch precipitation as furni&s;hed their enemies with a plau&s;ible pretence to affirm that they had not con&s;idered the treaty with the coolne&s;s and deliberation which an affair of this importance required.</P>

<P>Before the lords began to inve&s;tigate the articles of the union, they, at the in&s;tance of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, brought in a bill for the &s;e|curity of the church of England, to be in&s;erted as a fundamental and e&s;&s;ential part of that treaty. It pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es without oppo&s;ition, and re|ceived the royal a&s;&s;ent. On the fifteenth day of February, the debates concerning the union began in the hou&s;e of lords, the queen being pre&s;ent, and the bi&s;hop
<PB N="330" REF="3330">
of Sarum chairman of the committee. The earls of Roche&s;ter, Angle&s;ey, and Nottingham, argued again&s;t the union; as did the bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells. Lord Haver&s;ham, in a premeditated harrangue, &s;aid the que&s;tion was, Whether two nations independent in their &s;overeignties, that had their di&s;tinct laws and intere&s;ts, their different forms of wor&s;hip, church-government and order, &s;hould be united into one kingdom? He &s;uppo&s;ed it an union made up of &s;o many mi&s;matched pieces, of &s;uch jarring incongruous ingredients, that &s;hould it ever take effect, it would carry the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of a &s;tanding power and force, to keep them from falling a&s;under and breaking in pieces every moment. He repeated what had been &s;aid by lord Bacon, that a unity pieced up by direct admi&s;&s;ion of contrarieties in the fundamental points of it, is like the toes of Nebuchadnezzar's image, which were made of iron and clay: they may cleave together, but would never incorporate. He di&s;&s;ented from the union for the &s;ake of the good old Engli&s;h con&s;titution, in which he dreaded &s;ome alteration from the additional weight of &s;ixty-one Scotti&s;h members, and the&s;e too returned by a Scotti&s;h privy-council. He took notice, that above one hundred Scotti&s;h peers, and as many commons, were excluded from &s;itting and voting in parliament, though they had as much right of inheritance to &s;it there, as any Engli&s;h peer had of &s;itting in the parliament of Eng|land. He expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion of this precedent; and a&s;ked what &s;e|curity any peer of England had for his right and privilege of peerage, which tho&s;e lords had not. He &s;aid, if the bi&s;hops would weaken their own cau&s;e, &s;o far as to give up the two great points of epi&s;copal ordination and confirma|tion; if they would approve and ratify the act for &s;ecuring the pre&s;byterian church-government in Scotland, as the true prote&s;tant religion and purity of wor&s;hip; they mu&s;t give up that which had been contended for between them and the pre&s;byterians for thirty years, and been defended by the greate&s;t and mo&s;t learned men in the church of England. He objected to the exempting articles, by which heritable offices and &s;uperiorities were re&s;erved. He affirmed that the union was contrary to the &s;en&s;e of the Scotti&s;h nation: that the mur|murs of the people had been &s;o loud as to fill the whole kingdom; and &s;o bold as to reach even to the doors of the parliament: that the parliament it&s;elf had &s;u&s;pended their beloved clau&s;e in the act of &s;ecurity for arming the people: that the government had i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, pardoning all &s;laughter, blood|&s;hed, and maiming, committed upon tho&s;e who &s;hould be found in turnults. From the&s;e circum&s;tances he concluded, that the Scotti&s;h nation was aver&s;e to an incorporating union, which he looked upon as one of the mo&s;t dangerous experiments to both nations. The lord North and Grey complained of the &s;mall and unequal proportion of the land-tax impo&s;ed upon Scotland. The earl of Nottingham &s;aid it was highly unrea&s;onable that the Scots, who were by the treaty let into all the branches of the Engli&s;h trade, and payed &s;o little towards the expence of the government, &s;hould moreover have &s;uch a round &s;um by way of equivalent. The &s;ame topics were in&s;i&s;ted upon by the lords North and Grey, Guern&s;ey, Granville, Stowell, and Abingdon. The earl of Nottingham, after having oppo&s;ed every article &s;eparately, concluded with words to this effect, <Q>&startq;As Sir John Maynard &s;aid to the late king at the revolution, that having buried all his cotemporaries in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, he was afraid, if his maje&s;ty had not come in that very juncture of time,
<PB N="331" REF="3340">
he might have likewi&s;e outlived the very laws; &s;o, if this union do pa&s;s, as I have no rea&s;on to doubt but it will, I may ju&s;tly affirm I have out|lived all the laws, and the very con&s;titution of England: I therefore pray to God to avert the dire effects which may probably en&s;ue from &s;uch an in|corporating union.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>The&s;e arguments and objections were an&s;wered by the lord-trea&s;urer Godolphin, the earls of Sunderland and Wharton, the lords Town&s;hend, Hal|lifax, and Somers, the bi&s;hops of Oxford, Norwich, and Sarum. They ob|&s;erved, that &s;uch an important mea&s;ure could not be effected without &s;ome in|conveniencies; but that the&s;e ought to be borne in con&s;ideration of the great|ne&s;s of the advantage: that the chief dangers to which the church was ex|po&s;ed, aro&s;e from France and popery; and this union would effectually &s;ecure it again&s;t the&s;e evils: that Scotland lay on the weake&s;t &s;ide of England, which could not be defended but by an expen&s;ive army. Should a war break out be|tween the two nations, and Scotland be conquered, yet even in that ca&s;e it would be nece&s;&s;ary to keep it under with a &s;tanding army, which any enter|pri&s;ing prince might model for his ambitious purpo&s;es, and joining with the Scots, en&s;lave his Engli&s;h dominions: that any union after a conque&s;t would be compul&s;ive, con&s;equently of &s;hort duration; whereas now it was volun|tary: that with regard to eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, all heats and animo&s;ities might be allayed by &s;oft and gentle management. The cantons of Switzerland, though they profe&s;&s;ed different religions, were yet united in one general body; and the diet of Germany was compo&s;ed of princes and &s;tates, among whom three different per&s;ua&s;ions prevailed; &s;o that two &s;orts of di&s;cipline might very well &s;ub&s;i&s;t under one legi&s;lature. If there was any danger on either &s;ide, it threatened the Scots much more than the Engli&s;h, as five hundred and thirteen members would certainly be too hard for forty-five; and in the hou&s;e of lords, &s;ix and twenty bi&s;hops would always preponderate again&s;t &s;ixteen peers from Scot|land. Notwith&s;tanding all the oppo&s;ition made by the lords of the Tory in|tere&s;t, every article was approved by a great majority, though not without a good number of prote&s;tations; and a bill of ratification was prepared in the lower hou&s;e by Sir Simon Harcourt the &s;ollicitor-general, in &s;uch an artful manner as to prevent all debates. All the articles, as they pa&s;&s;ed in Scotland, were re|cited by way of preamble, together with the acts made in both parliaments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Boyer. Quincy. Torcy. Tindal.

Voltaire.</NOTE> for the &s;ecurity of their &s;everal churches; and in conclu&s;ion there was one clau&s;e by which the whole was ratified and enacted into a law. By this con|trivance, tho&s;e who were de&s;irous of &s;tarting new difficulties, found them&s;elves di&s;abled from pur&s;uing their de&s;ign. They could not object to the recital, which was barely matter of fact; and they had not &s;trength &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e the general enacting clau&s;e. On the other hand, the Whigs promoted it with &s;uch zeal, that it pa&s;&s;ed by a majority of one hundred and fourteen, before the others had recollected them&s;elves from the &s;urprize which the &s;tructure of the bill had occa&s;ioned. It made its way through the hou&s;e of lords with equal di&s;patch; and, when it received the royal &s;anction, the queen expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction. She &s;aid &s;he did not doubt but it would be remembered and &s;poke of hereafter, to the honour of tho&s;e who had been in&s;trumental in bringing it to &s;uch a happy conclu&s;ion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1707.</NOTE> As the act of union did not take place till the fir&s;t of May, a great number of traders in both kingdoms re&s;olved to make advantage of this inter|val. The Engli&s;h pro$o&s;ed to export into Scotland &s;uch commodities as in|titled them to a drawback, with a view to bring them back after the fir&s;t of May. The Scots, on the other hand, as their duties were much lower than tho&s;e in England, intended to import great quantities of wine, brandy, and other merchandize, which they could &s;ell at a greater advantage in England after the union, when there would be a free intercour&s;e between the two na|tions. Some of the mini&s;ters had embarked in this fraudulent de&s;ign, which alarmed the merchants of England to &s;uch a degree, that they pre&s;ented a re|mon&s;trance to the commons. Re&s;olutions were immediately taken in the hou&s;e again&s;t the&s;e practices, and a bill was prepared; but the lords apprehending that it in &s;ome mea&s;ure infringed the articles of the union, and that it might give umbrage to the Scotti&s;h nation, it was dropped. The frauds had been in a good mea&s;ure prevented by the previous re&s;olutions of the hou&s;e; and the fir&s;t day of May was now at hand; &s;o that the bill was thought unnece&s;&s;ary. On the twenty-fourth day of April, the queen prorogued the parliament, after having given them to under&s;tand, that &s;he would continue by proclamation the lords and commons already a&s;&s;embled, as members in the fir&s;t Briti&s;h parliament on the part of England, pur&s;uant to the power ve&s;ted in her by the acts of parliament of both kingdoms, ratifying the treaty of union. The parliament was accordingly revived by proclamation, and another i&s;&s;ued to convoke the fir&s;t parliament of Great Britain for the twenty-third day of Octo|ber. The Scots repaired to London, where they were well received by the queen, who be&s;towed the title of duke on the earls of Roxburgh and Mon|tro&s;e. She likewi&s;e granted a commi&s;&s;ion for a new privy-council in that kingdom, to be in force till the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, that the nation might not be di&s;gu&s;ted by too &s;udden an alteration of outward appearances. The fir&s;t of May was appointed as a day of public thank&s;giving; and congra|tulatory addre&s;&s;es were &s;ent up from all parts of England: but, the univer|&s;ity of Oxford prepared no compliment; and the Scots were wholly &s;ilent on this occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion the commons, in an addre&s;s to the queen, de&s;ired &s;he would re&s;ettle the i&s;lands of St. Chri&s;topher's and Nevis in the We&s;t-Indies, which had been ravaged by the enemy. They likewi&s;e re&s;olved, That an humble addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to her maje&s;ty, praying, &s;he would con|cert mea&s;ures for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a body of pyrates who had made a &s;ettlement on the i&s;land of Madaga&s;car, as al&s;o for recovering and pre&s;erving the antient po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, trade, and fi&s;hery in Newfoundland. The French refugees likewi&s;e delivered a remon&s;trance to the queen, recapitulating the benefits which the per|&s;ecuted prote&s;tants in France had reaped from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her royal proge|nitors, acknowledging their own happine&s;s in living under her gentle govern|ment, among a people by whom they had been &s;o kindly entertained when driven from their native country; and imploring her maje&s;ty's interpo&s;ition and good offices in favour of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted brethren abroad. She graciou&s;ly received this addre&s;s, declaring, &s;he had always great compa&s;&s;ion for
<PB N="333" REF="3360">
the unhappy circum&s;tances of the prote&s;tants in France: that &s;he would com|municate her thoughts on this &s;ubject to her allies: and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her hope that &s;uch mea&s;ures might be taken as &s;hould effectually an&s;wer the intent of their petition. In the month of May &s;he granted an audience to an amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary from the czar of Mu&s;covy, who delivered a letter from his ma&s;ter, containing complaints of king Augu&s;tus, who had maltreated the Ru&s;&s;ian troops &s;ent to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, concluded a di&s;honourable peace with Charles king of Sweden, without the knowledge of his allies, and &s;urrendered count Patkul the Mu&s;covite mini&s;ter, as a de&s;erter, to the Swedi&s;h monarch, contrary to the law of nations, and even the practice of barbarians. He therefore de|&s;ired her Britannic maje&s;ty would u&s;e her good offices for the enlargement of the count, and the other Ru&s;&s;ian pri&s;oners detained at Stockholm; and, that &s;he would take into her protection the remains of the Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries upon the Rhine, that they might either enter into the &s;ervice of the allies, or be at liberty to return in &s;afety to their own country. The queen actually interpo&s;ed in behalf of Patkul; but her interce&s;&s;ion proved ineffectual, and that unhappy mini&s;ter was put to death with all the circum&s;tances of wanton barbarity. As many &s;evere and &s;arca&s;tic writings had lately appeared, in which the Whigs and mi|ni&s;try were reviled, and reflections hinted to the prejudice of the queen's per&s;on, the government re&s;olved to make examples of the authors and publi&s;hers of the&s;e licentious productions. Dr. Jo&s;eph Browne was twice pilloried for a copy of ver&s;es, intituled, "The country par&s;on's advice to the lord-keeper," and a letter which he afterwards wrote to Mr. &s;ecretary Harley. William Stephens, rector of Sutton in Surrey, underwent the &s;ame &s;entence, as author of a pamphlet, called, "A letter to the author of the memorial of the church of England." Edward Ward was fined and &s;et in the pillory, for having written a burle&s;que poem on the times, under the title of "Hudibras redivivus;" and the &s;ame pu|ni&s;hment was inflicted upon William Pittes, author of a performance, intituled, "The ca&s;e of the church of England's memorial fairly &s;tated."</P>

<P>The lower hou&s;e of convocation &s;till continued to wrangle with their &s;uperiors; and though they joined the upper hou&s;e in a congratulatory addre&s;s to the queen, on the &s;ucce&s;s of her arms, they re&s;olved to make application to the hou&s;e of commons again&s;t the union. The queen been appri&s;ed of their de&s;ign, de&s;ired the archbi&s;hop to prorogue them for three weeks, before the ex|piration of which, the act of union had pa&s;&s;ed in parliament. The lower hou&s;e delivered a repre&s;entation to the bi&s;hops, in which they affirmed, no &s;uch pro|rogation had ever been ordered during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. The bi&s;hops found in their records &s;even or eight precedents of &s;uch prorogations, and above thirty in&s;tances of the convocation's having &s;at &s;ometimes before, and &s;ometimes after a &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, nay, &s;ometimes even when the parliament was di&s;|&s;olved. The queen, informed of the&s;e proceedings, wrote a letter to the archbi&s;hop, intimating, that &s;he looked upon the lower hou&s;e as guilty of an inva&s;ion of her royal &s;upremacy: and, that if any thing of the &s;ame nature &s;hould be attempted for the future, &s;he would u&s;e &s;uch means for puni&s;hing offenders as the law warranted. The prolocutor ab&s;enting him&s;elf from the convocation, the archbi&s;hop pronounced &s;entence of contumacy again&s;t him. The lower hou&s;e in a prote&s;tation declared this &s;entence unlawful and altoge|ther null. Neverthele&s;s, the prolocutor made a full &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, with which the
<PB N="334" REF="3370">
archbi&s;hop was &s;atisfied; and the &s;entence was repealed. About this period the earl of Sunderland was appointed one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, in the room of Sir Charles Hedges. This change was not effected without great op|po&s;ition from Harley, who was in his heart an enemy to the duke of Marlbo|rough and all his adherents; and had already, by his &s;ecret intrigues, made con|&s;iderable progre&s;s in a &s;cheme for &s;uper&s;eding the influence of the dutche&s;s.</P>

<P>The French king at this juncture &s;eemed to be intirely abandoned by his former good fortune. He had &s;u&s;tained &s;uch a number of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive de|feats as had drained his kingdom of people; and his trea&s;ury was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted. He endeavoured to &s;upport the credit of his government by i&s;&s;uing mint-bills, in imitation of the bank-notes of England; but, notwith&s;tanding all his precautions, they pa&s;&s;ed at a di&s;count of three and fifty per cent. The lands lay uncultivated; the manufactures could be no longer carried on; and the &s;ubjects peri&s;hed with famine. The allies, on the other hand, &s;eemed to pro&s;per in every quarter. They had become ma&s;ters of the greate&s;t part of the Netherlands, in con&s;equence of the victory at Ramillies: the army of king Charles was con&s;iderably reinforced; and a &s;cheme was formed for the conque&s;t of Toulon, by the troops of the emperor and the duke of Savoy, &s;upplied with a large &s;um of money by queen Anne, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the combined fleets of England and Holland, under the command of Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel. In a word, France &s;eemed to be reduced to the verge of de&s;truction, from which no|thing in all probability could have &s;aved her, but the jealou&s;y and mi&s;conduct of the confederates. Lewis, by virtue of his capitulation with the emperor in Italy, was enabled to &s;end &s;uch reinforcements into Spain, as turned the fortune of the war in that country; while the di&s;tractions in the council of king Charles prevented that unanimity and concurrence, without which no &s;ucce&s;s can be expected. The earl of Peterborough declared again&s;t an offen&s;ive war, on ac|count of the difficulty of finding &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in Ca&s;tile; and advi&s;ed Charles to tru&s;t to the expedition again&s;t Toulon. This opinion he &s;ent from Italy, to which he had withdrawn.</P>

<P>Charles, however, was per&s;uaded to penetrate once more to Madrid, and give battle to the enemy wherever they &s;hould appear. On the thirteenth day of March the army was a&s;&s;embled at Caudela, to the number of &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, under the au&s;pices of the marquis das Minas, to whom the earl of Galway was &s;econd in command. They marched towards Yecla, and un|dertook the &s;iege of Vilena; but, having received intelligence that the duke of Berwick was in the neighbourhood, they advanced on the fourteenth day of April in four columns towards the town of Almanza, where the enemy were drawn up in order of battle, their number being con&s;iderably &s;uperior to that of the con&s;ederates. The battle began about two in the afternoon, and the whole front of each army was fully engaged. The Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;quadrons on the left, &s;u&s;tained by the Portugue&s;e hor&s;e of the &s;econd line, were overpowered after a gallant re&s;i&s;tance. The center, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of battalions from Great-Britain and Holland, obliged the enemy to give way, and drove their fir&s;t upon their &s;econd line; but, the Portugue&s;e cavalry on the right being broken at the fir&s;t charge, their foot betook them&s;elves to flight; &s;o that the Engli&s;h and Dutch troops being left naked on the flanks, were &s;urrounded and attacked on every &s;ide. In this dreadful emergency, they formed them&s;elves
<PB N="335" REF="3380">
into a &s;quare, and retired from the field of battle. By this time the men were quite &s;pent with fatigue, and all their ammunition ex$au&s;ted: they were ignorant of the country, abandoned by their hor&s;e, de&s;titute of provi&s;ion, and cut off from all hope of &s;upply. Moved by the&s;e di&s;mal con&s;iderations they capitulated, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, to the amount of thirteen battalions. The Portugue&s;e, and part of the Engli&s;h hor&s;e, with the infantry that guarded the baggage, retreated to Alcira, where they were joined by the earl of Galway, with about five and twenty hundred dragoons which he had brought from the field of battle. About three thou&s;and men of the allied army were killed upon the &s;pot, and among that number brigadier Killigrew, and many officers of di&s;|tinction. The earl of Galway, who charged in per&s;on at the head of Gui&s;card's dragoons, received two deep cuts in the face. The marquis das Minas was run through the arm, and &s;aw his concubine, who fought in the habit of an Am$|zon, killed by his &s;ide: the lords Tyrawley, Mark Ker, and colonel Clayton, were wounded: all their artillery, together with an hundred and twenty colours and &s;tandards, and about ten thou&s;and men, were taken; &s;o that no victory could be more complete, though it was not purcha&s;ed without the lo&s;s of two thou&s;and men &s;lain in the action, including &s;ome officers of eminence. The duke of Berwick, who commanded the troops of king Philip, acquired a great addition of fame by his conduct and behaviour before, and during the engage|ment; but his authority was &s;uper&s;eded by the duke of Orleans, who arrived in the army immediately after the battle. This prince &s;eemed to entertain &s;ome private views of his own; for he took no effectual &s;tep to improve the victory. He began a private negotiation with the earl of Galway, during which the two armies lay inactive on the banks of the Cinca; and he concluded the campaign with the &s;iege of Lerida, which was &s;urrendered by capitulation on the &s;econd day of November: then the troops on both &s;ides went into winter-quarters. The earl of Galway and the marquis das Minas embarked at Barcelona for Li&s;bon, and general Carpenter remained commander of the Engli&s;h forces quar|tered in Catalonia, which was now the only part of Spain that remained to king Charles.</P>

<P>The attempt upon Toulon by the duke of Savoy and prince Eugene might have &s;ucceeded, if the emperor, notwith&s;tanding the repeated remon|&s;trances of the maritime powers, had not divided his army in Italy, by detach|ing a con&s;iderable body through the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate towards Naples, of which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without any difficulty. Be&s;ides, ten thou&s;and recruits de&s;tined for the Imperial forces in Italy, were detained in Germany, from an appre|hen&s;ion of the king of Sweden, who remained in Saxony, and &s;eemed to be upon very indifferent terms with the emperor. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Eng|li&s;h and Dutch fleets the duke of Savoy and prince Eugene pa&s;&s;ed the Var on the eleventh day of July, at the head of an army of thirty thou&s;and men, and marched directly towards Toulon, whither the artillery and ammunition were cenveyed on board of the combined &s;quadrons. They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the eminences that commanded the city, and the ordnance being landed, e$ected batteries, From the&s;e they began to cannonade and bombard the city, while the fleet at|tacked and reduced two forts at the entrance of the mole; and co-operated in the &s;iege with their great guns and bomb-ketches. The garri&s;on was numerous, and defended the place with great vigour. They &s;unk &s;hips in the entrance to
<PB N="336" REF="3390">
the mole: they kept up a prodigious fire from the ramp$rts: they made de&s;perate &s;allies; and even drove the be&s;iegers from one of their po&s;ts with great &s;laughter. The French king, alarmed at this de&s;ign of his enemies, ordered troops to march towards Toulon from all parts of his dominions. He countermanded the forc$s that were on their route to improve the victory of Almanza: a great part of the army under Villars on the Rhine was detached to Provence, and the court of Ver&s;ailles declared, that the duke of Burgundy &s;hould march at the head of a &s;trong army to the relief of Toulon. The duke of Savoy being appri&s;ed of the&s;e preparations, &s;eeing no hope of reducing the place, and being apprehen|&s;ive that his pa&s;&s;age would be intercepted, re&s;olved to abandon his enterprize. The artillery being reimbarked, with the &s;ick and wounded, he decamped in the night, and retreated to his own country without mole&s;tation. Then he undertook the reduction of Suza, the garri&s;on of which &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. By this conque&s;t he not only &s;ecured the key to his own dominions, but al&s;o opened to him&s;elf a free pa&s;&s;age into Dauphin&eacute;.</P>

<P>Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel having left a &s;quadron with Sir Thomas Dilkes for the Mediterranean &s;ervice, &s;et &s;ail for England with the re&s;t of the fleet, and was in &s;oundings on the twenty-&s;econd day of October. About eight o'clock at night his own &s;hip, the A&s;&s;ociation, &s;truck upon the rocks of Scilly, and peri&s;hed with every per&s;on on board. This was likewi&s;e the fate of the Eagle and the Romney: the Firebrand was da&s;hed in pieces on the rocks; but the captain and four and twenty men &s;aved them&s;elves in the boat: the Phoenix was driven on &s;hore: the Royal Anne was &s;aved by the pre&s;ence of mind and uncommon dexterity of Sir George Byng and his officers: the St. George, com|manded by the lord Dur&s;ley, &s;truck upon the rocks, but a wave &s;et her a-float again. The admiral's body being ca&s;t a-&s;hore was &s;tripped and buried in the &s;and; but afterwards di&s;covered and brought into Plymouth, from whence it was conveyed to London and interred in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey. Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel was born of mean parentage in the county of Suffolk; but rai&s;ed him|&s;elf to the chief command at &s;ea by his indu&s;try, valour, &s;kill, and integrity. On the Upper Rhine the Allies were unpro&s;perous. The prince of Baden was dead, and the German army &s;o incon&s;iderable, that it could not defend the lines of Buhl again&s;t the marechal de Villars, who broke through this work, e&s;teemed the rampart of Germany, reduced Ra&s;tadt, defeated a body of hor&s;e, layed the dutchy of Wirtemberg under contribution, took S$u$gard and Schorndorf; and routed three thou&s;and Germans intrenched at Lo$ch, under the command of general Janus, who was made pri&s;oner. In all probability, this active officer would have made great progre&s;s towards the re&s;toration of the elector of Bavaria, had not he been obliged to &s;top in the middle of his career, in con&s;equence of his army's being dimini&s;hed by &s;ending off detachments to Provence. The Imperial army retired towards Hailbron, and the command of it was, at the reque&s;t of the emperor and allies, a&s;&s;umed by the elector of Ha|nover, who re&s;tored military di&s;cipline, and acted with uncommon prudence and circum&s;pection; but he had not force &s;ufficient to undertake any enterprize of importance.</P>

<P>In the month of April the duke of Marlborough &s;et out from the Hague for Leip&s;ick with a letter from the queen to Charles XII. of Sweden, who&s;e de&s;igns were &s;till &s;o my&s;terious, that the confederates could not help being
<PB N="337" REF="3400">
alarmed at his being in the heart of Germany. The duke was pitched upon as the mo&s;t proper amba&s;&s;ador, to &s;oothe his vanity and penetrate into his real in|tention <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the duke arrived in his coach at the quarters of count Piper, of whom he had de|manded an audience, he was given to under&s;tand, that the count was bu&s;y, and obliged to wait half an hour before the Swedi&s;h mini&s;ter came down to receive him. When he appeared at la&s;t, the duke alighted from his coach, put on his hat, pa&s;&s;ed the count without &s;aluting him, and went a&s;ide to the wall, where having &s;tayed &s;ome time, he returned, and acco&s;ted him with the mo&s;t polite addre&s;s.</NOTE>. He found this original character, not &s;imple, but &s;ordid in his ap|pearance and oeconomy, &s;avage in his deportment, ferocious, illiterate, &s;tub|born, implacable, and re&s;erved. The Engli&s;h general a&s;&s;ailed him on the &s;ide of his vanity, the only part by which he was acce&s;&s;ible. <Q>&startq;Sire (&s;aid he) I pre|&s;ent to your maje&s;ty a letter, not from the chancery, but from the heart of the queen my mi&s;tre&s;s, and written with her own hand. Had not her &s;ex prevented her from taking &s;o long a journey, &s;he would have cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to &s;ee a prince admired by the whole univer&s;e. I e&s;teem my&s;elf happy in having the honour of a&s;&s;uring your maje&s;ty of my regard; and I &s;hould think it a great happine&s;s, if my affairs would allow me to learn under &s;o great a general as your maje&s;ty, what I want to know in the art of war.&endq;</Q> Charles was plea&s;ed with this over&s;trained compliment, which &s;eems to have been calculated for a raw, unintelligent barbarian, unacquainted with the cha|racters of mankind. He profe&s;&s;ed particular veneration for queen Anne, as well as for the per&s;on of her amba&s;&s;ador, and declared he would take no &s;teps to the prejudice of the grand alliance. Neverthele&s;s, the &s;incerity of this de|claration has been que&s;tioned. The French court is &s;aid to have gained over his mini&s;ter count Piper to their intere&s;t. Certain it is, he indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought oc|ca&s;ion to quarrel with the emperor, and treated him with great in&s;olence, until he &s;ubmitted to all his demands. The treaty being concluded upon the terms he thought proper to impo&s;e, he had no longer the lea&s;t &s;hadow of pretence to continue his di&s;putes with the court of Vienna; and therefore began his march for Poland, which was by this time over-run by the czar of Mu&s;covy.</P>

<P>The duke of Marlborough returning from Saxony, a&s;&s;embled the allied army at Anderlach near Bru&s;&s;els, about the middle of May; and, under|&s;tanding that the elector of Bavaria and the duke of Vendome, who commanded the French forces, had quitted their lines, he advanced to Soignies, with a de|&s;ign to engage them in the plain of Flerus. But receiving certain intelligence, that the enemy were greatly &s;uperior to the allies in number, by the help of draughts from all their garri&s;ons, he retreated towards Bru&s;&s;els, and took po&s;t at Mildert; while the French advanced to Gemblours. Both armies lay inac|tive until the enemy &s;ent off a large detachment towards Provence. Then the duke of Marlborough and general Overkirk re&s;olved to attack them in their fortified camp at Gemblours. But, they retreated with &s;uch celerity from one po&s;t to another, that the confederates could not come up with them until they were &s;afely encamped with their right at Pont a Tre&s;in, and their left under the cannon of Li&s;le, covered with the river Schelde, and &s;ecured by intrenchments. The allies cho&s;e their camp at Helchin, and foraged under the cannon of Tour|nay, within a league of the enemy; but nothing could induce them to hazard an engagement; and both armies went into winter-quarters at the latter end of

October. The duke of Marlborough &s;et out for Franckfort, where he con|ferred with the electors of Mentz, Hanover, and Palatine, about the operations of the next campaign: then he returned to the Hague, and having concerted $$e nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures with the deputies of the &s;tates-general, embarked for England in the beginning of November. The queen's private favour was now &s;hitted to a new object. The dutche&s;s of Marlborough was &s;upplanted by Mrs. Ma&s;ham, her own kin&s;woman, whom &s;he had re&s;cued from indigence and ob|&s;$urity. This favourite &s;ucceeded to that a&s;cendency over the &s;pirit of her &s;o|vereign, which the dutche&s;s had formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. She was more humble, pliable, and obliging, than her fir&s;t patrone&s;s, who had played the tyrant, and thwarted the queen in &s;ome of her mo&s;t re&s;pected maxims. Her maje&s;ty's pre|p$&s;&s;e$$ion in favour of the Tories and high-churchmen, was no longer in&s;o|lently condemned, and violently oppo&s;ed. The new confidante conformed to all her prejudices, and encouraged all her de&s;igns with a&s;&s;ent and approbation. In political intrigues &s;he acted as a&s;&s;ociate, or rather auxiliary to Mr. Secretary Harley, who had in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the queen's good graces; and deter|mined to &s;ap the credit of the duke of Marlborough and the earl of Godolphin. His aim was to unite the Tory intere&s;t under his own au&s;pices, and expel the Whigs from the advantages they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed under the government. His chief co|adjutor in this &s;cheme was Henry St. John, afterwards lord Bolingbroke, a man of warm imagination and elegant ta&s;te, penetrating, eloquent, ambitious, and enterpri&s;ing, who&s;e talents were rather &s;pecious than &s;olid, and who&s;e principles were loo&s;e and fluctuating. He was at fir&s;t contented to act in an inferior capa|city, &s;ub&s;ervient to the de&s;igns of the &s;ecretary; but, when he under&s;tood the full extent of his own parts and influence, he was fired with the ambition of eclip&s;ing his principal, and from the &s;phere of his mini&s;ter, rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the character of his rival. The&s;e politicians, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sir Simon Harcourt, a colleague of uncommon ability and credit, exerted their endeavours to rally and reconcile the di&s;united Tories, who were given to under&s;tand, that the queen could no longer bear the tyranny of the Whigs: that &s;he had been always a friend in her heart to the Tory and high-church party: and that &s;he would now exhibit manife&s;t proofs of her inclination. She accordingly be|&s;towed the bi&s;hopricks of Che&s;ter and Exeter upon Sir William Dawes and Dr. Blackall, who, though otherwi&s;e of unblemi&s;hed characters, had openly con|demned the revolution.</P>

<P>The people in general began to be &s;ick of the Whig mini&s;try, whom they had formerly care&s;&s;ed. To them they imputed the burthens under which they groaned; burthens which they had hitherto been animated to bear by the pomp of triumph and uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s. At pre&s;ent they were di&s;|couraged by the battle of Almanza, the mi&s;carriage of the expedition again&s;t Toulon, the lo&s;s of Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel, and the fate of four &s;hips of the line, de&s;troyed or taken by a &s;quadron under the command of me&s;&s;ieurs Forbin and Du Gue Trouin, two of the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing &s;ea-officers in the French &s;ervice. No new advantage had been obtained in the Netherlands: France, in&s;tead of &s;inking under the weight of the confederacy, &s;eemed to ri&s;e with fre&s;h vigour from every overthrow: the Engli&s;h traders had lately &s;u&s;tained repeated lo&s;&s;es for want of proper convoys: the coin of the nation was vi&s;ibly dimi|ni&s;hed, and the public credit began to decline. The Tories did not fail to in|culcate
<PB N="339" REF="3420">
and exaggerate the&s;e cau&s;es of di&s;content, and the mini&s;try were too remi&s;s in taking proper &s;teps for the &s;atisfaction of the nation. In&s;tead of &s;oothing by gentle mea&s;ures and equal admini&s;tration, the Scots, who had expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch aver&s;ion to the union, they treated them in &s;uch a manner, as &s;erved to exa&s;pe|rate the &s;pirits of that people. A &s;top was put to their whole commerce for two months before it was diverted into the new channel. Three months elap&s;ed before the equivalent was remitted to that kingdom, and it was afterwards applied with the mo&s;t &s;hameful partiality. Seizures of wines and other merchandize im|ported from thence into England, were made in all the northern parts, with an affectation of &s;everity and di&s;dain: &s;o that the generality of the Scotti&s;h na|tion loudly exclaimed again&s;t the union and the government. The Jacobites were again in commotion. They held conferences: they maintained a cor|re&s;pondence with the court of St. Germain's: a great number of the mo&s;t rigid Whigs entered &s;o far into their mea&s;ures, as to think a revolution was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to retrieve the liberties, independence, and commerce of their country: the pretender's birth-day was publicly celebrated in many different parts of the kingdom; and every thing &s;eemed to portend an univer&s;al revolt. Ireland continued quiet under the admini&s;tration of the earl of Pem|broke, whom the queen had appointed lord$lieutenant of that kingdom. A parliament having met at Dublin in the month of July, pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es of congratulation to her maje&s;ty on the late union of the two kingdoms. The commons having in&s;pected the public accounts, re&s;olved, That the kingdom had been put to exce&s;&s;ive charge by means of great arrears of rent$returned by the late tru&s;tees, as due out of the forfeited e&s;tates, which returns were fal&s;e and unju&s;t: and, That an humble repre&s;entation &s;hould be layed before her maje&s;ty on this &s;ubject. They pa&s;&s;ed another laudable re&s;olution in favour of their own manufactures. They granted the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, and having fini&s;hed &s;everal bills for the royal a&s;&s;ent, were prorogued on the twenty-ninth day of October.</P>

<P>It was on the twenty-third of the &s;ame month that the fir&s;t parliament of Great Britain a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, when the queen in her &s;peech to both hou&s;es palliated the mi&s;carriages in Provence and in Spain; re|pre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of making further efforts again&s;t the common enemy$ and exhorted them to be upon their guard again&s;t tho&s;e who endeavoured to &s;ow jealou&s;ies in the commonwealth. The commons in their addre&s;s expre&s;&s;ed the continuance of their former zeal and devotion to her maje&s;ty's government$ but, in the hou&s;e of lords the earl of Wharton expatiated upon the &s;carcity of money, the decay of trade, the mi&s;management of the navy. He was &s;e|conded by lord Somers and the leaders of the Tory party, who propo&s;ed, that previous to every mea&s;ure, they &s;hould con&s;ider the &s;tate of the nation. The de&s;ign of Wharton and Somers was to rai&s;e the earl of Orford once more to the head of the admiralty; and the Tories, who did not perceive their drift, hoped in the cour&s;e of the inquiry to fix the blame of all mi&s;management upon the Whig mini&s;ters. A day being fixed for this examination, the hou&s;e re|ceived a petition from the &s;heriffs and merchants of London, complaining of great lo&s;&s;es by &s;ea, for want of crui&s;ers and convoys; and the&s;e complaints were proved by witne&s;&s;es. The report was &s;ent to the lord-admiral, who an&s;wered all the articles &s;eparately: then the Tories moved for an addre&s;s, in which the
<PB N="340" REF="3430">
blame of the mi&s;carri$ges might be layed upon the mini&s;try and cabinet-council; but the motion was over-ruled, and the queen was pre&s;ented with a bare repre|&s;entation of the facts, and de&s;ired that &s;he would take the proper mea&s;ures for pre|venting &s;uch evils for the future. The commons made &s;ome progre&s;s in an in|quiry of the &s;ame nature; and brought in a bill for the better &s;ecuring the trade of the kingdom. They chearfully granted the &s;upplies for the &s;ervice of the en|suing year. They prepared another bill for repealing the Scotti&s;h act of &s;ecurity, and that about peace and war, which had excited &s;uch jealou&s;y in the Engli&s;h nation. They re&s;olved, That there &s;hould be but one privy-council in the kingdom of Great-Britain: That the militia of Scotland &s;hould be put on the &s;ame footing with that of England: That the powers of the ju&s;tices of the peace &s;hould be the &s;ame through the whole i&s;land: That the lords of ju&s;ticiary in Scotland &s;hould go circuits twice in the year: That the wr$ts for electing Scotti&s;h members to &s;erve in the hou&s;e of commons, &s;hould be directed, and returns made in the &s;ame manner as practi&s;ed in England. An act being formed on the&s;e re&s;olutions, they brought in a bill for pre&s;erving the trade with Portugal: then they con&s;idered the &s;tate of the war in Spain. When the queen pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e bills, &s;he recommended an augmentation in the aids and auxiliaries granted to the king of Spain and the duke of Savoy.</P>

<P>This intimation produced a debate in the hou&s;e of lords, on the affairs of Spain. The &s;ervices of the earl of Peterborough were extolled by the earl of Roche&s;ter and lord Haver&s;ham, who levelled &s;ome oblique reflections at the earl of Galway. Several lords enlarged upon the nece&s;&s;ity of carrying on the war until king Charles &s;hould be fully e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the throne of Spain. The earl of Peterborough &s;aid, they ought to contribute nine &s;hillings in the pound rather than make peace on any other terms: he declared him&s;elf ready to return to Spain, and &s;erve even under the earl of Galway. The earl of Ro|che&s;ter repeated a maxim of the old duke of Schomberg, That attacking France in the Netherlands was like taking a bull by the horns. He therefore propo&s;ed, that the allies &s;hould &s;tand on the defen&s;ive in Flanders, and detach from thence fifteen or twenty thou&s;and men into Catalonia. He was &s;econded by the earl of No$tingham, but warmly oppo&s;ed by the duke of Marlborough, who urged, that the great towns in Brabant which he had conquered, could not be pre|&s;erved without a con&s;iderable number of men: and, that if the French &s;hould gain any advantage in Flanders from their &s;uperiority in point of number, the di&s;contented party in Holland, which was very numerous, and bore with impa|tience the burthen of the war, would not fail crying aloud for peace. Being challenged by Roche&s;ter, to &s;hew how troops could be procured for the &s;ervice of Italy and Spain, he a&s;&s;ured the hou&s;e, that mea&s;ures had been already con|certed with the emperor, for forming an army of forty thou&s;and men under the duke of Savoy, and for &s;ending powerful &s;uccours to king Charles. This de|claration fini&s;hed the debate, which i&s;&s;ued in an affectionate addre&s;s to her ma|je&s;ty. The lords re&s;olved, That no peace could be &s;afe and honourable for her maje&s;ty and her allies, if Spain and the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies were &s;uffered to continue in the power of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. They pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, in which they de&s;ired &s;he would pre&s;s the emperor to &s;end powerful &s;uccours to Spain, under the command of prince Eugene, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, to make good his contract with the duke of Savoy, and &s;trengthen the army on
<PB N="341" REF="3440">
the Rhine, which was now happily p$t under the conduct of that wife and va|liant prince the elector of Hanover. The commons concurred in this remon|&s;trance, in con&s;equence of which the queen de&s;ired the emperor to be&s;tow the command in Spain upon prince Eugene. The court of Vienna, however, did not comply with this reque&s;t; but &s;ent thither count Staremberg, who, of all the German generals, was next to the prince in military reputation. The com|mons now proc$eded to con&s;ider of ways and means, and actually e&s;tabli&s;hed funds for rai&s;ing the &s;upply, which amounted to the enormous &s;um of six millions.</P>

<P>At this period Mr. Harley's character incurred &s;u&s;picion fro$ the treachery of William Gregg, an inferior clerk in his office, who was detected in a corre&s;pondence with mon&s;ieur Chamillard the French king's mini&s;ter. When his practices were detected, he made an ample confe&s;&s;ion, and pleading guilty to his indictment at the Old-Bailey, was condemned to death for high-trea&s;on. At the &s;ame time, John Bara and Alexander Valiere were committed to Newgate, for corre&s;ponding with the enemy; and Claude Baud, &s;ecretary to the duke of Savoy's mini&s;ter, was, at the reque&s;t of his ma&s;ter, apprehended for traiterous practices again&s;t her maje&s;ty and her government. A committee of &s;even lords being appointed to examine the&s;e delinquents, made a report to the hou&s;e, which was communicated to the queen in an addre&s;s, importing, that Gregg had di&s;covered &s;ecrets of &s;tate to the French mini&s;ter: that Alexander Valiere and John Bara had managed a corre&s;pondence with the governors and commi&s;&s;aries of Calais and Boulogne; and, in all probability, di&s;covered to the enemy the &s;tations of the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers, the &s;trength of their convoys, and the times at which the m$rchant-&s;hips proceeded on their voyages: that all the papers in the office of Mr. &s;ecretary Harley had been for a con&s;iderable time expo&s;ed $o the view of the meane&s;t clerks; and that the peru&s;al of all the let|ters to and from the French pri&s;oners, had been chiefly tru&s;ted to Gregg, a per&s;on of a very &s;u&s;picious character, and known to be extremely indigent. The queen granted a reprieve to this man, in hope of his making &s;ome important di&s;covery: but he really knew nothing of con&s;equence to the nation. He was an indigent Scot, who had been employed as a &s;py in his own country, and now offered his &s;ervices to Chamillard, with a view of being rewarded for his treachery: but he was di&s;covered before he had reaped any fruits from his cor|re&s;pondence. As he had no &s;ecrets of importance to impart, he was ex|ecuted at Tyburn, where he delivered a paper to the &s;heriff, in which he de|clared Mr. Harley intirely ignorant of all his trea&s;onable connections, notwith|&s;tanding &s;ome endeavours that were made to engage him in an accu&s;ation of that mini&s;ter.</P>

<P>The queen had refu&s;ed to admit the earl of Peterborough into her pre&s;ence, until he &s;hould have vindicated his conduct, of which king Charles had complained in divers letters. He was eagerly de&s;irous of a parliamentary inquiry. His military proceedings, his negotiations, his di&s;po&s;al of the re|mittances, were taken into con&s;ideration by both hou&s;es: but he produced &s;uch a number of witne&s;&s;es and original papers to ju&s;tify every tran&s;action, that his character triumphed in the inquiry, which was dropped before it produced any re&s;olution in parliament. Then they took cognizance of the &s;tare of af|fairs in Spain, and found there had been a great d$$$ciency in the Engli&s;h troops
<PB N="342" REF="3450">
at the battle of Almanza. This, however, was explained &s;o much to their &s;a|tisfaction, that they voted an addre&s;s to the queen, thanking her for having taken mea&s;ures to re&s;tore the affairs in Spain, and provide foreign troops for that &s;ervice. The bill for rendering the union more complete met with a vigorous oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of lords, from the court-party, on account of the clau&s;e enacting, That, after the fir&s;t of May, there &s;hould be but one privy-council in the kingdom of Great Britain. The mini&s;try finding it was &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported by all the Tories, and a con&s;iderable number of the other faction, would have compromi&s;ed the difference, by propo&s;ing that the privy-council of Scotland &s;hould continue to the fir&s;t day of October. They hinted this ex|pedient in hope of being able to influence the en&s;uing elections: but their de|&s;ign being palpable, the motion was over-ruled, and the bill received the royal a&s;&s;ent: a court of exchequer, however, was erected in Scotland upon the mo|del of that in England. The execution of Gregg, and the examination of Valiere and Bara, who had acted as &s;mugglers to the coa&s;t of France, under the protection of Harley, to whom they engaged for intelligence, affected the credit of that mini&s;ter, who was reviled and traduced by the emi&s;&s;aries of the Whig mini&s;ters. The duke of Marlborough and the earl of Godolphin being appri&s;ed of his &s;ecret practices with Mrs. Ma&s;ham, wrote to the queen that they could &s;erve her no longer, &s;hould Mr. Harley continue in the po&s;t of &s;e|cretary. Being &s;ummoned to the cabinet-council, they waited on her in per|&s;on, and expo&s;tulated on the &s;ame &s;ubject. She endeavoured to appea&s;e their re&s;entment with &s;oft per&s;ua&s;ion, which had no effect; and, when they retired from court, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all the &s;pectators, &s;he repaired in per&s;on to the council. There Mr. &s;ecretary Harley began to explain the cau&s;e of their meeting, which was &s;ome circum&s;tance relating to foreign affairs. The duke of Somer&s;et &s;aid he did not &s;ee how they could deliberate on &s;uch matters while the general and trea&s;urer were ab&s;ent: the other members ob&s;erved a &s;ullen &s;ilence; &s;o that the council broke up, and the queen found her&s;elf in danger of being abandoned by her mini&s;ters. Next day her maje&s;ty &s;ent for the duke of Marlborough, and told him that Harley &s;hould immediately re&s;ign his of|fice, which was conferred upon Mr. Henry Boyle, chancellor of the exchequer: but &s;he deeply re&s;ented the deportment of the duke and the earl of Godolphin, from whom &s;he intirely withdrew her confidence. Sir Simon Harcourt at|torney-general, Sir Thomas Man&s;el comptroller of the hou&s;hold, and Mr. St. John, relinqui&s;hed their &s;everal po&s;ts upon the di&s;grace of Harley.</P>

<P>The kingdom was at this period alarmed with a threatened in|va&s;ion from France. The court of St. Germain's had &s;ent over one colonel Hooke with credentials to Scotland, to learn the &s;ituation, number, and ability, of the pretender's friends in that country. This mini&s;ter, by his mi&s;conduct, produced a divi&s;ion among the Scotti&s;h Jacobites. Being a creature of the duke of Perth, he attached him&s;elf wholly to the duke of Athole, and tho&s;e other zealous parti&s;ans who were bent upon receiving the pretender without condi|tions; and he neglected the duke of Hamilton, the earl Mari&s;chal, and other adherents of that hou&s;e, who adopted the more moderate principles avowed by the earl of Middleton. At his return to France, he made &s;uch a favourable report of the di&s;po&s;ition and power of the Scotti&s;h nation, that Lewis re&s;olved to equip an armament and &s;end over the pretender to that kingdom. His pre|tence
<PB N="343" REF="3460">
was to e&s;tabli&s;h that prince on the throne of his ance&s;tors: but his real aim was to make a divi&s;ion from the Netherlands, and excite a revolt in Great Bri|tain, which &s;hould hinder queen Anne from exerting her&s;elf again&s;t France on the continent. He began to make preparations for this expedition at Dunkirk, where a &s;quadron was a&s;&s;embled under the command of the chevalier de Fourbin; and a body of land-forces were embarked with mon&s;ieur de Gace, afterwards known by the appellation of the marechal de Ma$ignon. The pretender, who had a&s;&s;umed the name of the chevalier de St. George, was furni&s;hed with &s;er|vices of gold and &s;ilver plate, &s;umptuous tents, rich cloaths for his life|guards, &s;plendid liveries, and all &s;orts of nece&s;&s;aries, even to profu&s;ion. Lewis, at parting, pre&s;ented him with a &s;word &s;tudded with valuable diamonds, and repeated what he had formerly &s;aid to this adventurer's father: <Q>&startq;He hoped he &s;hould never &s;ee him again.&endq;</Q> The pope contributed to the expence of this expedition, and accommodated him with divers religious mottos, which were wrought upon his colours and &s;tandards. Queen Anne being informed of the&s;e preparations, and the de&s;ign of the French monarch, communicated to the commons the advices which &s;he had received from Holland and the Netherlands, touching the de&s;tination of the Dunkirk armament; and both hou&s;es concurred in an addre&s;s, a&s;&s;uring her they would a&s;&s;i&s;t her maje&s;ty with their lives and fortunes, again&s;t the pretended prince of Wales, and all her other enemies. Then they pa&s;&s;ed a bill, enacting, That the oath of abjura|tion &s;hould be tendered to all per&s;ons, and &s;uch as refu&s;ed to take it &s;hould be in the condition of convicted recu&s;ants. By another, they &s;u&s;pended the Habeas corpus act till October, with relation to per&s;ons apprehended by the govern|ment on &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable practices. The pretender and his adherents were proclaimed traitors and rebels; and a bill was pa&s;&s;ed$ di&s;charging the clans of Scotland from all va&s;&s;alage to tho&s;e chiefs who &s;hould take up arms again&s;t her maje&s;ty. Tran&s;ports were hired to bring over ten Briti&s;h battalions from O&s;tend; and a large fleet being equipped with incredible diligence, &s;ailed from Deal towards Dunkirk, under the conduct of Sir John Leake, Sir George Byng, and lord Dur&s;ley. The French imagined that Leake had &s;ailed to Li&s;|bon, and that Britain was unprovided of &s;hips of war; &s;o that they were amazed and confounded when this fleet appeared off Mardyke: a &s;top was immediately put to the embarkation of their troops: frequent expre&s;&s;es were di&s;patched to Paris: the count de Fourbin repre&s;ented to the French king the little probability of &s;ucceeding in this enterprize, and the danger that would attend the attempt: but he received po&s;itive orders to embark the forces, and &s;et &s;ail with the fir&s;t favourable wind.</P>

<P>The Briti&s;h fleet being forced from their &s;tation by &s;evere weather on the fourteenth day of March, the French &s;quadron &s;ailed on the &s;even|teenth from the road of Dunkirk; but the wind &s;hifting, it anchored in New|port-pits, till the nineteenth in the evening, when they &s;et &s;ail again with a fair breeze, &s;teering their cour&s;e for Scotland. Sir George Byng having re|ceived advice of their departure, from an O&s;tend ve&s;&s;el &s;ent out for that pur|po&s;e by major-general Cadogan, gave chace to the enemy, after having de|tached a &s;quadron under admiral Baker to convoy the troops that were em|barked at O&s;tend for England. On the tenth day of March, the queen went to the hou&s;e of peers, where, in a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, &s;he told them that
<PB N="344" REF="3470">
the French fleet had &s;ailed; that Sir George Byng was in pur&s;uit of them; and that ten battalions of her troops were expected every day in England. This intimation was followed by two very warm addre&s;&s;es from the lords and commons, in which they repeated their a&s;&s;urances of &s;tanding by her again&s;t all her enemies; exhorted her to per&s;evere in &s;upporting the common cau&s;e$ notwith|&s;ta$ding this petty attempt to di&s;turb her dominions; and leve$ed &s;ome &s;evere in$inuations aga$n&s;t tho&s;e who endeavoured to foment jealeu&s;ies between her maje&s;ty and her mo&s;t faithful &s;ervants. Addre&s;&s;es on the &s;ame occa&s;ion were &s;ent up from different parts of the kingdom; &s;o that the queen &s;eemed to look with contempt upon the de&s;igns of the enemy. Several regiments of foot, with &s;ome &s;quadrons of cavalry$ began their march for Scotland; while the earl of Leven, commander in chief of the forces in that country, and gover|nor of the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, ha&s;tened thither to put that fortre&s;s in a po&s;|ture of defence, and to make the proper di&s;po&s;itions to oppo&s;e the pretender at his landing. But the vigilance of Sir George Byng rendered all the&s;e precau|tions unnece&s;&s;ary. He &s;ailed directly to the frith of Edinburgh, where he arrived almo&s;t as &s;oon as the enemy, who immediately took the advantage of a land breeze, and bore away with all the &s;ail they could carry. The Eng|li&s;h admiral gave chace; and the Sali&s;bury, one of their &s;hips, was boarded and taken. At night mon&s;ieur de Fourbin altered his cour&s;e; &s;o that next day they were out of reach of the Engli&s;h &s;quadron. The pretender de&s;ired they would proceed to the northward, and land him at Inverne&s;s, and Four|bin &s;eemed willing to gratify his reque&s;t; but the wind changing, and blow|ing in their teeth with great violence, he repre&s;ented the danger of attempting to pro&s;ecute the voyage; and$ with the con&s;ent of the chevalier de St. George and his general, returned to Dunkirk, after having been to&s;&s;ed about a whole month in very tempe&s;tuous weather. In the mean time, Sir George Byng &s;ailed up to Leith road, where he received the freedom of the city of Edin|burgh in a golden box, as a te&s;timony of gratitude for his having delivered them from the dreadful apprehen&s;ions under which they laboured.</P>

<P>Certain it is, the pretender could not have cho&s;en a more fa|vourable opportunity for making a de&s;cent upon Scotland. The people in ge|neral were di&s;affected to the government on account of the union: the regular troops under Leven did not exceed five and twenty hundred men, and even great part of the&s;e would in all probability have joined the invader: the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh was de&s;titute of ammunition, and would in all appearance have &s;urrendered at the fir&s;t &s;ummons; in which ca&s;e the Jacobites mu&s;t have been ma&s;ters of the equivalent money lodged in that fortre&s;s: a good number of Du$ch &s;hips loaded with cannon, &s;mall arms, ammunition, and a large &s;um of money, had been driven on &s;hore in the &s;hire of Angus, where they would have been &s;eized by the friends of the pretender, had the French troops been landed; and all the adherents of that hou&s;e were ready to appear in arms. In England, &s;uch a demand was made upon the bank, by tho&s;e who favoured the inva&s;ion, and tho&s;e who dreaded a revolution, that the public credit &s;eemed to be in danger. The commons re&s;olved, That whoever de&s;ignedly endeavoured to de&s;troy or le&s;&s;en the public credit, e&s;pecially at a time when the kingdom was threatened with an inva&s;ion, was guilty of a high crime and mi&s;de|meanour$ and an enemy to her maje&s;ty and the kingdom.

The French, Dutch, and Jewi&s;h menchants, who&s;e intere&s;t was in a pe|culiar manner connected with the &s;afety of the bank, exerted them&s;elves for its &s;upport; and the directors having called in twenty per cent. upon their capital &s;tock, were enabled to an&s;wer all the demands of the timorous and di&s;affected. All the nobleman and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction in Scotland, &s;u&s;pected of an at|tachment to the court of St. Germain's, were apprehended, and either im|pri&s;oned in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, or brought up to London, to be confined in the Tower or in Newgate. Among the&s;e was the duke of Hamilton, who found means to make his peace with the Whig mini&s;ters; and, in a little time, the other pri&s;oners were admitted to bail <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Cami&s;ars, or prote&s;tants from the Cevennois, having made their e&s;cape, and re|paired to London, acquired about this time the appellation of French prophets, from their en|thu&s;ia&s;tic ge&s;ticulations, effu&s;ions, and convul|&s;ions, and even formed a &s;ect of their country|men. The French refugees, &s;candalized at their behaviour, and authorized by the bi&s;hop of Lon|don, as &s;uperior of the French congregations, re&s;olved to inquire into the mi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e pre|tended prophets, who&s;e names were Elias Ma|rion, John Cavallier, and Durand Fage. They were declared impo&s;tors and counterfeits. Not|with&s;tanding this deci&s;ion, which was confirmed by the bi&s;hops, they continued their a&s;&s;emblies in Soho, under the countenance of Sir Richard Bulkley and John Lacy. They reviled the mini&s;ters of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; they denounced judg|ments again&s;t the city of London, and the whole Briti&s;h nation; and publi&s;hed their predictions, compo&s;ed of unintelligible jargon. Then they were pro&s;ecuted at the expence of the French churches, as di&s;turbers of the public peace, and fal&s;e prophets. They were &s;entenced to pay a fine of twenty marks each, $$d $word$ $wice on a &s;caffold, with papers on their br$$&s;ts d$$oting their offence: a &s;entence which was executed accordingly at Charing-cro&s;s and the Royal Ex|change.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>On the fir&s;t day of April, the parliament was prorogued, and afterwards di&s;&s;olved by proclamation. Writs were i&s;&s;ued out for new<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

After the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament, the lords Griffin, Clermont, two &s;ons of the earl of Middleton, and &s;everal Scotti&s;h and Iri&s;h officers, who had been taken on board of the Sali&s;bury, were brought to London, and impri&s;oned in the Tower or in Newgate. Lord Griffin being attained by outlawry, for high-trea&s;on committed in the reign of king William, was brought to the bar in the court of king's-bench, and a rule made for his execution: but he was re|prieved from month to month, until he died of a natural death in pri&s;on. The privy-council of Scotland was di&s;&s;olved, the duke of Queen&s;berry created a Briti&s;h peer, by the title of baron of Rippon, marquis of Beverley, and duke of Dover; and the office of &s;ecretary at war, vacant by the re&s;ignation of Henry St. John, was be&s;towed upon Robert Walpole, a gentleman who had rendered him&s;elf con&s;iderable in the hou&s;e of commons, and who&s;e conduct we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention more at large in the &s;equel.

<P>The French king, not at all di&s;couraged by the mi&s;carriage of his projected inva&s;ion, re&s;olved to improve the advantages he had gained on the continent during the la&s;t campaign; and indeed he made efforts that were alto|gether incredible, con&s;idering the con&s;umptive &s;tate of his finances. He a&s;&s;embled a prodigious army in the Netherlands, under the command of the duke of Burgundy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Vendome, and accompanied by the duke of Berry and the chevalier de St. George. The elector of Bavaria was de&s;tined to the command of the troops upon the Rhine, where he was &s;econded by the duke of Berwick; and the marechal de Villeroy was &s;ent to conduct the forces in Dauphin&eacute;. About the latter end of March, the duke of Marlborough repaired to the Hague, where he was met by prince Eugene, and the&s;e two celebrated generals conferred with the pen|&s;ionary Hein&s;ius, and the deputies of the &s;tates-general. Then they made an excur&s;ion to Hanover, where they prevailed upon the elector to be &s;atisfied with acting upon the defen&s;ive in his command on the Rhine, and &s;pare part of his forces, that the confederates might be enabled to make vigorous efforts in the Netherlands. The prince proceeded to Vienna, and the duke returned to Flanders, where he a&s;&s;embled the army towards the latter end of May. On the twenty-fifth day of that month, the duke of Vendome marched to Soignies, and po&s;ted him&s;elf within three leagues of the confederates, who were encamped at Billinghen and Halle. The duke of Marlborough having received intelli|gence that the enemy were on their march by Bois-Seigneur-I&s;aac to Braine-la-Leu, concluded their intention was to take po&s;t on the banks of the Deule, to hinder the allies from pa&s;&s;ing that river, and to occupy Louvaine. He there|fore commanded the army to march all night, and on the third day of June encamped at Terbank, general Overkirk fixing his quarters in the &s;uburbs of Louvaine, while the French advanced no farther than Genap and Braine-la-Leu. As they were more numerous than the confederates, and headed by a prince of the blood, the general of the allies at fir&s;t expected that they would hazard a battle: but their &s;cheme was to retrieve by &s;tratagem the places they had lo&s;t in Flanders. The elector of Bavaria had rendered him&s;elf extremely popular in the great towns: the count de Bergeyck, who had great intere&s;t among them, was devoted to the hou&s;e of Bourbon: the inhabitants of the great cities were naturally incon&s;tant and mutinous, and particularly di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied with the Dutch government. The French generals re&s;olved to profit by the&s;e circum&s;tances. A detachment of their troops, under the brigadiers la Faille and Pa&s;teur, &s;urpri&s;ed the city of Ghent, in which there was no garri&s;on; and, at the &s;ame time, the count de la Motte, with a &s;trong body of forces, ap|peared before Bruges, which was &s;urrendered to him without oppo&s;ition: then he made a fruitle&s;s attempt upon Damme, and marched to the little fort of Pla&s;&s;endahl, which he took by a&s;&s;ault. The duke of Marlborough was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of the enemy's having &s;ent a &s;trong detachment towards Tu|bize, than he marched from Terbank, pa&s;&s;ed the canal, and encamped at An|derlech. The French cro&s;&s;ed the Senne at Halle and Tubize, and the allies re&s;olved to attack them next morning; but they pa&s;&s;ed the Dender in the night with great expedition; and the duke of Marlborough next day en|camped at A&s;che, where he was joined by prince Eugene, who had marched
<PB N="347" REF="3500">
with a con&s;iderable reinforcement of Germans from the Mo&s;elle. The enemy under&s;tanding that this general was on his march, determined to reduce Oude|narde, the only pa&s;s on the Schelde po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the allies; and inve&s;ted it on the ninth day of July, hoping to &s;ubdue it before the allies could be reinforced. The duke of Marlborough was immediately in motion, and made a &s;urpri&s;ing march from A&s;che, as far as Herfelingen, where he was joined by the reinforce|ment. Then he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong camp at Le&s;&s;ines, which the French had intended to occupy in order to cover the &s;iege of Oudenarde.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="35" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>Thus di&s;appointed, the French generals altered their re&s;olution, aban|doned Oudenarde, and began to pa&s;s the Schelde at Gavre. The two generals of the confederates were bent upon bringing them to an engagement. Cadogan was &s;ent with &s;ixteen battalions and eight &s;quadrons to repair the roads, and throw bridges over the Schelde below Oudenarde. The army was in motion at eight o'clock, and marched with &s;uch expedition, that by two in the afternoon the hor&s;e had reached the bridges over which Cadogan and his detachment were pa&s;&s;ing. The enemy had po&s;ted &s;even battalions in the village of Heynem, &s;ituated on the banks of the Schelde, and the French hou&s;hold-troops were drawn up in order of battle on the adjacent plain, oppo&s;ite to a body of troops under major-general Rantzaw, who were po&s;ted behind a rivulet that ran into the river. The duke of Vendome intended to attack the confederates when one half of their army &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed the Schelde; but he was thwarted by the duke of Burgundy, who &s;eemed to be perplexed and irre&s;o|lute. He had ordered the troops to halt in their march to Gavre, as if he had not yet formed any re&s;olution; and now he recalled the &s;quadrons from the plain, determined to avoid a battle. Vendome remon&s;trated again&s;t this con|duct, and the di&s;pute continued till three in the afternoon, when the greater part of the allied army had pa&s;&s;ed the Schelde without oppo&s;ition. Then the duke of Burgundy declared for an engagement, and Vendome &s;ubmitted to his opinion with great reluctance, as the opportunity was now lo&s;t and the army unformed. Major-general Grimaldi was ordered to attack Rantzaw with the hor&s;e of the king's hou&s;hold, who finding the rivulet mar&s;hy, refu&s;ed to charge, and retired to the right. Mean while Cadogan attacked the village of Hey|nem, which he took, with three of the &s;even battalions by which it was guarded. Rantzaw pa&s;$ing the rivulet, advanced into the plain, and drove before them &s;everal &s;quadrons of the enemy. In this attack, the electoral prince of Hanover, his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, charged at the head of Bulau's dragoons with great in|trepidity. His hor&s;e was &s;hot under him, and colonel Lu&s;chky killed by his &s;ide. Divers French regiments were intirely broken, and a good number of officers and &s;tandards fell into the hands of the Hanoverians. The confederates continued &s;till pa&s;&s;ing the river; but few or none of the infantry were come up till five in the afternoon, when the duke of Argyle arrived with twenty bat|talions, which immediately &s;u&s;tained a vigorous a&s;&s;ault from the enemy. By this time the French were drawn up in order of battle; and the allies being formed as they pa&s;&s;ed the river, both armies were engaged through the whole extent of their lines about &s;even in the evening. Europe had not for many years produced two &s;uch noble armies: above one hundred general officers ap|peared in the field, and two hundred and fifty colonels fought at the head of their re&s;pective regiments. The number of the French exceeded that of the
<PB N="348" REF="3510">
allies by twelve thou&s;and: but their generals were divided; their forces ill di&s;po&s;ed, and their men di&s;p$rited by the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s of their adver|&s;aries. They &s;eemed from the beginning aver&s;e to an engagement, and acted in hurry and trepidation. Neverthele&s;s, the action was maintained until ge|neral Overkirk and count Tilly, who commanded on the left of the allies, obliged the right of the enemy to give ground; and the prince of Orange with count Oxien&s;tern attacked them in flank with the Dutch infantry. Then they began to give way, and retired in great confu&s;ion. The duke of Vendome alighting from his hor&s;e, rallied the broken battalions, called the officers by name, con|jured them to maintain the honour of their country, and animated the men with his voice and example. But, notwith&s;tanding all his endeavours, they were forced back among the inclo&s;ures in great confu&s;ion. Some regiments were cut in pieces: others de&s;ired to capitulate; and, if the darkne&s;s had not interpo&s;ed$ their whole army would have been ruined. The night coming on, &s;o that it became impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h friends from enemies, the two ge|nerals ordered the troops to cea&s;e firing, and the enemy took this opportunity of e&s;caping, by the road which leads from Oudenarde to Ghent. The duke of Vendome &s;eeing the French forces flying in the utmo&s;t terror and precipita|tion, formed a rear-guard of about five and twenty &s;quadrons and as many battalions, with which he &s;ecured the retreat. To this precaution the &s;afety of their army was entirely owing; for at day-break the duke of Marlborough &s;ent a large detachment of hor&s;e and foot under the lieutenant-generals Bulau and Lumley, to pur&s;ue the fugitives; but the hedges and ditches that &s;kirted the road were lined with the French grenadiers in &s;uch a manner, that the cavalry could not form, and they were obliged to de&s;i&s;t. The French reached Ghent about eight in the morning, and marching through the city, encamped at Lovendegen on the canal. There they thought proper to ca&s;t up intrench|ments, upon which they planted their artillery which they had left at Gavre with their heavy baggage. About three thou&s;and were &s;lain on the field of battle: two thou&s;and de&s;erted, and about &s;even thou&s;and were taken, includ|ing a great number of officers, together with ten pieces of cannon, above an hundred &s;tandards and colours, and four thou&s;and hor&s;es. The lo&s;s of the allies did not amount to two thou&s;and men; nor was one officer of di&s;tinction killed on their &s;ide during the whole engagement. After the confederates had re&s;ted two days on the field of battle, a detachment was ordered to level the French lines between Ypres and the Lys: another was &s;ent to rai&s;e contributions as far as Arras, and &s;truck terror even into the city of Paris. While the allies plundered the province of Picardy, a detachment from the French army, under the chevalier de Rozen, made an irruption into Dutch-Flanders; broke through the lines of Bervliet, which had been left unguarded, and made a de&s;cent upon the i&s;land of Ca&s;andt, which they laid under contribution.</P>

<P>The generals of the allies now undertook an enterprize which, in the opinion of the French generals, favoured of ra&s;hne&s;s and incon&s;iderate &s;elf-&s;ufficiency. This was the &s;iege of Li&s;le, the &s;tronge&s;t town in Flanders, provided with all nece&s;&s;aries, &s;tore of ammunition, and a garri&s;on reinforced by one and twenty battalions of the be&s;t troops in France, commanded by marechal de Boufflers in per&s;on. But the&s;e were not the principal difficulties which the allies encountered. The enemy had cut off the communication be|tween
<PB N="349" REF="3520">
them and their magazines at Antwerp and Sas-Van-Ghent; &s;o that they were obliged to bring their convoys from O&s;tend along a narrow cau&s;eway, ex|po&s;ed to the attack of an army more numerous than that with which they &s;at down before Li&s;le. On the thirteenth of Augu&s;t, it was inve&s;ted on one &s;ide by prince Eugene, and on the other by the prince of Orange-Na&s;&s;au, &s;tadt|holder of Frie&s;land; while the duke of Marlborough encamped at Helchin, to cover the &s;iege. The trenches were opened on the twenty-&s;econd day of Au|gu&s;t, and carried on with that vigour and alacrity which is always in&s;pired by victory and &s;ucce&s;s. The dukes of Burgundy and Vendome being now joined by the duke of Berwick, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to relieve the place; and made &s;e|veral marches and counter-marches for this purpo&s;e. Marlborough being ap|pri&s;ed of their intention, marched out of his lines to give them battle, being re|inforced by a con&s;iderable body of troops from the &s;iege, including Augu&s;tus king of Poland, and the landgrave of He&s;&s;e as volunteers: but the enemy declined an engagement, and the allies returned to their camp, which they for|tified with an intrenchment. On the &s;eventh day of September, the be&s;iegers took by a&s;&s;ault the counter&s;carp of Li&s;le, after an ob&s;tinate action, in which they lo&s;t a thou&s;and men. The French generals continued to hover about the camp of the confederates, which they actually cannonaded; and the duke of Marlborough again formed his army in order of battle: but their de&s;ign was only to harra&s;s the allies with continual alarms, and interrupt the operations of the &s;iege. They endeavoured to &s;urpri&s;e the town of Aeth, by means of a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the inhabitants; but the con&s;piracy was di&s;covered before it took effect Then they cut off all communication between the be&s;iegers and the Schelde, the banks of which they fortified with &s;trong in|trenchments, and a prodigious number of cannon; &s;o that now all the &s;tores and nece&s;&s;aries were &s;ent to the camp of the confederates from O&s;tend. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of September prince Eugene, who was in the trenches, &s;eeing the troops driven by the enemy from a lodgment they had made on the counter&s;carp of the Tenaille, rallied and led them back to the charge; but being wounded over the left eye with a mu&s;ket-&s;hot, he was obliged to retire, and for &s;ome days the duke of Marlborough &s;u&s;tained the whole command, both in the &s;iege and of the covering army. On the twenty third, the Tenaille was &s;tormed, and a lodgment made along the covered-way. Marechal Boufflers having found means to inform the duke of Vendome that his ammunition was almo&s;t expended, this general detached the chevalier de Luxemburg with a body of hor&s;e and dragoons to &s;upply the place with gun-powder, every man carrying a bag of forty pounds upon the crupper. They were di&s;covered in pa&s;&s;ing through the camp of the allies, and pur&s;ued to the barrier of the town, into which about three hundred were admitted; but a great number were killed by the confederates, or mi&s;erably de&s;troyed by the explo&s;ion of the powder which they carried.</P>

<P>The next attempt of the French generals was to intercept a convoy from O&s;tend. The count de la Motte marched from Ghent with about two and twenty thou&s;and men to attack this convoy, which was guarded by &s;ix thou&s;and of the allies, commanded by major-general Webb, who made &s;uch an admirable di&s;po&s;ition by the wood of Wynendale, and received the enemy with &s;uch a clo&s;e fire, that, after a very warm action that la&s;ted two hours,
<PB N="$50" REF="3530">
they retired in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding their great &s;uperiority in n$mber, leaving &s;ix thou&s;and men killed upon the field of battle; the lo&s;s of the allies not exceeding nine hundred and twelve officers and &s;oldiers. This was the mo&s;t honourable exploit performed during the whole war, and of &s;uch con&s;equence to the confederates, that if the convoy had been taken, the &s;iege mu&s;t have been rai&s;ed. The duke of Vendome ordered the dykes between Bruges and Newport to be cut, &s;o as to lay the whole country under water, in hope of de&s;troying the communication between O&s;tend and the camp of the confederates; and, after a regular &s;iege, he took colonel Caulfield and a body of Briti&s;h troops po&s;ted in the village of Leffinghen, by who&s;e means the convoys had been forwarded to the duke of Marlborough. On the twenty-&s;econd of October, marechal Boufflers de&s;ired to capitulate for the town of Li&s;le: next day the articles were &s;igned: on the twenty-fifth the allies took po&s;&s;e$&s;ion of the place, and the marechal retired into the citadel with the re|mains of his garri&s;on, which, from twelve thou&s;and, was reduced to le&s;s than the half of that number. A negotiation was begun for the &s;urrender of the ci$adel: but Boufflers made &s;uch extravagant demands as were rejected with di&s;dain. Ho&s;tilities were renewed on the twenty-ninth day of the month; and the earl of Stair was detached to provide corn for the army in the di&s;tricts of Furnes and Dixmuyde. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, velt-marechal Overkirk died at Rou&s;&s;elaer, in the &s;ixty-&s;$venth year of his ag$, after having, in above thirty campaigns, exhibited innumerable proofs of uncommon courage, ability, and moderation. The duke of Vendome did not yet de&s;pai$ of obliging the confederates to abandon their enterprize: the French mini&s;ters at Rome and Venice publicly declared the allied army was cooped up in &s;uch a manner, that it mu&s;t either rai&s;e the &s;iege or be fami&s;hed. The elector of Bavaria, with a detachment of ten thou&s;and men, marched to Bru&s;&s;els and attacked the counter&s;carp with incredible fury; but was repul&s;ed by the garri&s;on under the command of general Pa&s;chal, and retired with precipitation, when he under|&s;tood that the duke of Marlborough was in motion to relieve the place. This nobleman and prince Eugene no &s;ooner under&s;tood the danger to which Bru&s;|&s;els was expo&s;ed, than they marched with the covering$army to the Schelde, which they pa$&s;ed on pontoons without oppo&s;ition, notwith&s;tanding the formi|dable works which the French had rai&s;ed. They now abandoned them with precipitation, to the &s;urprize of the confederates, who had laid their account with the lo&s;s of a thou&s;and men in the attack. Having pa&s;&s;ed the river between E&s;kena$$e and Hauterive, as well as at other places, they marched to Oude|narde, where they received intelligence that the elector had retreated. Then prince Eugene returned to Li&s;le, and the duke of Marlborough proceeded to Bru&s;&s;els, where he was received with joy and acclamation. He afterwards took po&s;t at Oudenarde, &s;o as to maintain a communication with prince Eugene.</P>

<P>The be&s;iegers having made lodgments and rai&s;ed batteries on the &s;econd counter&s;carp of the citadel, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Bou$$$ers, intimating, that if he would &s;urrender before the opening of the batteries, he &s;hould have an honourable capitulation; otherwi&s;e he and his garri&s;on mu&s;t be made pri|&s;oners of war. He cho&s;e to avoid the la&s;t part of the alternative: ho&s;tages were exchanged on the eighth day of December, and the articles &s;igned on the tenth; when the marechal and his garri&s;on marched out with the honours of
<PB N="351" REF="3540">
war, and were conducted to Doway. In this great enterprize, &s;pirit and per&s;e|verance made amends for want of fore&s;ight and &s;kill, which was flagrant on the &s;ide of the confederates; though their &s;ucce&s;s was owing in a great mea|&s;ure to the improvidence and mi&s;conduct of the be&s;ieged. The French generals never dreamed that the allies would attempt any thing of con&s;equence after the reduction of Li&s;le, con&s;idering the advanced &s;ea&s;on of the year, and therefore they returned to Paris, after having di&s;tributed their army into winter-quarters. But their indefatigable antagoni&s;ts were determined to &s;trike another &s;troke of importance before their forces &s;hould &s;eparate. On the twentieth day of De|cember they inve&s;ted the city of Ghent on all &s;ides; and on the thirtieth, when the batteries were ready to open, the count de la Motte, who commanded the garri&s;on, de&s;ired to capitulate. On the third day of the next month he marched out with thirty battalions and &s;ixteen &s;quadrons, which were conducted $o Tournay; while the duke of Argyle, with &s;ix Briti&s;h battalions, took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;&s;ion of the town and citadel. Then the enemy abandoned Bruges, Pla&s;&s;en|dahl, and Leffengen; and the generals of the allies having &s;ettled the plan of winter-quarters, repaired to Holland, leaving the forces under the command of count Tilly. The French king was confounded and di&s;mayed at the&s;e co$que&s;ts in the Netherlands. Nor was he ea&s;y on the &s;ide of Dauphin&eacute;, where, in &s;pite of all the vigilance and activity of Villars, the duke of Savoy made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the important fortre&s;&s;es of Exilles, La Perou&s;e, the valley of St. Martin, and Fene&s;trelles; &s;o that by the end of the campaign he had &s;ecured a barrier to his own frontiers, and opened a way into the French provinces, after having made a diver&s;ion in favour of king Charles, by oblig|ing the enemy to &s;end a &s;trong detatachment from Rou&s;illon to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Villars.</P>

<P>The campaign in Catalonia was productive of a great event. Count Guido de Staremberg arrived at Barcelona on the la&s;t day of April; but the Impe|rial troops brought from Italy by admiral Leake, did not land in time to relieve Torto&s;a, which the duke of Orleans be&s;ieged and took, together with Denia, the garri&s;on of which were made pri&s;oners of war, contrary to the articles of capitulation. The&s;e lo&s;&s;es, however, were abundantly made up to the allies by the conque&s;t of Sardinia and Minorca. Sir John Leake, having taken on board a handful of troops, under the conduct of the marquis D'Alconzel, &s;et &s;ail for Cagliari, and &s;ummoned the viceroy to &s;ubmit to king Charles. As he did not &s;end an immediate an&s;wer, the admiral began to bombard the city, and the inhabitants compelled him to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. The greater part of the garri&s;on enli&s;ted them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of Charles. The deputies of the &s;tates being a&s;&s;embled by the marquis D'Alconzel, acknowledged that prince as their &s;overeign, and agreed to furni&s;h his army with thirty thou&s;and &s;acks of corn, which were accordingly tran&s;ported to Catalonia, where there was a great &s;carcity of provi&s;ion. Major-general Stanhope having planned the conque&s;t of Minorca, and concerted with the admiral the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to put it in excu|tion, obtained from count Staremberg a few battalions of Spaniards, Italians, and Portugue&s;e, embarked at Barcelona with a fine train of Briti&s;h artillery, accompanied by brigadier Wade and colonel Petit, an engineer of great repu|tation. They landed on the i&s;land about two miles from St. Philip's fort, on the twenty-&s;ixth of Augu&s;t, with about eight hundred marines, which aug|mented
<PB N="352" REF="3550">
their number to about three thou&s;and. Next d$y they $rected batte|ries; and general Stanhope ordered a number of arrows to be &s;hot into the place, to which papers were affixed, written in the Spani&s;h and French languages, containing threats, that all the garri&s;on &s;hould be &s;ent to the $word$ if they would not &s;urren$er before the batteries were fini&s;hed. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of a thou&s;and Spaniards and &s;ix hundred French marines, commanded by colonel la Jonquiere, who imagined that the number of the be&s;iegers amounted to at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and; &s;o artfully had they been drawn up in &s;ight of the enemy. The batteries began to play, and in a little time demoli&s;hed $our towers that &s;erved as outworks to the fort: then they made a breach in the outward wall, through which brigadier Wade, at the head of the gre$adiers, $$ormed a redoubt, with &s;uch extraordinary valour as &s;truck the $e&s;ieged with con|&s;ter$$tion. On the &s;econd or third day they thought proper to beat a parley, and capitulate, on condition, That they &s;hould march out with the honours of war: That the Spaniards &s;hould be tran&s;ported to M$$cia and the French to Tou$on. The&s;e la&s;t, however, were detained by way of rep$i&s;al for the gar|ri&s;on of Denia. The Spani&s;h governor was &s;o mortified when he learned the real number of the be&s;iegers, that on his arrival at Murcia he threw him&s;elf out of a window in de&s;pair, and was killed upon the &s;pot. La Jonquiere was con|fined for life, and all the French officers incurred their ma&s;ter's di&s;plea&s;ure. Fort St. Philip being thus reduced, to the amazement of all Europe, and the garri&s;on of Port Fornelles having &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners to the admi|rals Leake and Whitaker, the inhabitants gladly &s;ubmitted to the Engli&s;h go|vernment, for king Philip had oppre&s;&s;ed and deprived them of their privil$ges; and general Stanhope appointed colonel Petit governor of Fort St. Philip, and deputy-governor of the whole i&s;land. After this important conque&s;t he re|turned to the army in Spain, where an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to &s;urpri&s;e Torto&s;a fini&s;hed the operations of the campaign.</P>

<P>The Briti&s;h fleet not only contributed to the reduction of Minorca, but likewi&s;e overawed the pope, who had endeavoured to form a league of the princes in Italy again&s;t the emperor. This ponti$$ had manife&s;ted his partiality to the hou&s;e of Bourbon in &s;uch a palpable manner, that his Imperial maje&s;ty ordered monfieur de Bonneval to march with the troops that were in Italy, rein|forced by tho&s;e belonging to the duke of Modena, and invade the du$chy of Ferrara. He accordingly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Comachio and &s;ame other places, pretending they were allodial e&s;tates belonging to the duke of Modena, and $ie$s of the emperor, to which the holy &s;ee had no lawful cl$$m$ The viceroy of Na|ples was forbid to remit any money to Rome; and the council of the kingdom drew up a long memorial, containing the preten&s;ions of his catholic maje&s;ty, which &s;truck at the very foundation of the pope's temporal power. His holi|ne&s;s wrote a long remon&s;trance to the emperor on the inju&s;tice of tho&s;e pro|ceedings, and declared, that he would a$$ert this cau&s;e t$ough he &s;hould lo&s;e his life in the conte&s;t. He forthwith began to rai$e an army, and revived a plan of forming a league among the princes and &s;tates of I$$$y for their mu|tual defence. Sir John Leake had received orders t$ bombard Civi$a-Vecchia, in re&s;entment for the pope's having countenanced the pretender's expedition to Great-Britain; but as the emperor and the duke of Savoy hoped to effect$an ac|commodation with the court of Rome, they p$$vailed upon the Engli&s;h admiral to &s;u&s;pend ho&s;tilities until they &s;hould have tried the method of negotiation. The
<PB N="353" REF="3560">
marquis de Prie, a Piedmonte&s;e nobleman, was &s;ent as amba&s;&s;ador to Rome; but, the pope would not receive him in that quality. Elated with the promi&s;es of France, he &s;et the emperor at defiance; and his troops having &s;ur|pri&s;ed a body of Imperiali&s;ts, were &s;o barbarous as to cut them all in pieces. The duke of Savoy having ended the campaign, the troops of the emperor which had &s;erved under that prince, were ordered to march into the papal territories, and drove the forces of his holine&s;s before them, without any regard to number. Bologna capitulated; and Rome began to tremble with the apprehen&s;ion of being once more &s;acked by a German army. Then the pope's courage failed: he was glad to admit the marquis de Prie as envoy from the emperor. He con&s;ented to di&s;band his new levies; to accommodate the Imperial troops with winter-quarters in the papal territories; to grant the inve&s;titure of Naples to king Charles; and allow at all times a pa&s;&s;age to the Imperial troops through his dominions. On the Upper Rhine the electors of Bavaria and Hanover were &s;o weak, that they could not undertake any thing of con&s;equence again&s;t each other. In Hungary the di&s;putes &s;till continued between the emperor and the malcontents. Poland was at length delivered from the oppre&s;&s;ion exerci&s;ed by the king of Sweden, who marched into the Ukraine again&s;t the czar of Mu&s;|covy, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions with which that monarch endeavoured to appea&s;e his indignation. During the cour&s;e of this year the Engli&s;h mer|chants &s;u&s;tained no con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es by &s;ea: the crui&s;ers were judiciou&s;ly &s;ta|tioned, and the trade was regularly &s;upplied with convoys. In the We&s;t-Indies commodore Wager de&s;troyed the admiral of the galleons, and took the rear-admiral on the coa&s;t of Carthagene. Had the officers of his &s;quadron done their duty, the greate&s;t part of the fleet would have fallen into his hands. At his return to Jamaica two of his captains were tried by a court-martial, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice.</P>

<P>The court of England was about this time not a little di&s;quieted, by the con&s;equences of an outrage committed on the per&s;on of the count de Ma|tueof the Mu&s;covite amba&s;&s;ador. He was publicly arre&s;ted at the &s;uit of a laceman, and maltreated by the bailiffs, who dragged him to pri&s;on, where he continued until he was bailed by the earl of Fever&s;ham. Incen&s;ed at this in|&s;ult, he demanded redre&s;s of the government, and was &s;econded in his remon|&s;trances by the mini&s;ters of the emperor, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and &s;everal other foreign potentates. The queen expre&s;&s;ed uncommon indignation again&s;t the authors of this violence, who were immediately apprehended, and orders were given to pro&s;ecute them with the utmo&s;t &s;everity of the law. Matueof repeated his complaints with great acrimony; and Mr. &s;ecretary Boyle a&s;&s;ured him, in the queen's name, that he &s;hould have ample &s;atisfaction. Notwith|&s;tanding this a&s;&s;urance, he demanded a pa&s;s for him&s;elf and his family, refu&s;ed the ordinary pre&s;ents at his departure, and retired to Holland. From thence he tran&s;mitted a memorial with a letter from the czar to the queen, in&s;i&s;ting upon her puni&s;hing with death all the per&s;ons concerned in violating the law of nations upon the per&s;on of his amba&s;&s;ador. Such puni&s;hment being altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the laws of England, the queen and her mini&s;try were extremely perplexed, and held &s;everal councils to deliberate upon the mea&s;ures proper to be taken on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. On the twenty-eighth day of October prince George of Denmark died of an a&s;thma and drop&s;y, with which he had been
<PB N="354" REF="3570">
long afflicted. He was a prince of an amiable rather than a &s;hining character, brave, good-natured, mode&s;t, and humane, but devoid of great talents and am|bition. He had always lived in harmony with the queen, who, during the whole term of their union, and e&s;pecially in his la&s;t illne&s;s, approved her&s;elf a pattern of conjugal truth and tenderne&s;s. At his death the earl of Pembroke was created lord high-admiral, the earl of Wharton promoted to the govern|ment of Ireland, and lord Somers appointed pre&s;ident of the council. Not|with&s;tanding the&s;e promotions of the Whig noblemen, the duke of Marlbo|rough declined $$ace in his credit with the queen, who privately con&s;ulted and repo&s;ed her chief confidence in Mr. Harley, though he had no vi&s;ible concern in the admini&s;tration.</P>

<P>The new parliament, in which the Whig intere&s;t &s;till preponderated, was a&s;&s;embled on the &s;ixteenth day of November, when they were given to un|der&s;tand by a commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal, that the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, the chancellor, the lord-trea&s;urer, the lord-&s;teward, and the ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, were appointed to repre&s;ent the per&s;on of her maje&s;ty, whom decency would not permit to appear in the hou&s;e &s;o &s;oon after the death of her con&s;ort. Sir Richard Onflow being cho&s;en &s;peaker of the lower hou&s;e with the queen's ap|probation, the chancellor, in a &s;peech to both hou&s;es$ recommended the vigo|rous pro&s;ecution of the war, telling them her maje&s;ty hoped, they would enable her to make a con&s;iderable augmentation for pre&s;erving and improving the ad|vantages which the allies had gained in the Netherlands: that &s;he de&s;ired they would prepare &s;uch bills as might confirm and render the union effectual: and, that if they would propo&s;e means for the advancement of trade and manufac|ture, &s;he would take plea&s;ure in enacting &s;uch provi&s;ions. Both hou&s;es having pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es of condolence and congratulation, on the death of prince George, and the &s;ucce&s;s of her maje&s;ty's arms during the la&s;t cam|paign, the commons took cognizance of controverted elections, which were decided with &s;hameful partiality for the Whig faction. Then they proceeded to con&s;ider the different branches of the &s;upply: they approved of an augmen|tation of ten thou&s;and men, which was judged nece&s;&s;ary for the more vigorous pro&s;ecution of the war$ and, they voted above &s;even m$llions for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uring year. The bank agreed to circulate two millions five hundred thou|&s;and pounds in exchequer b$$ls for the government, on condition, that the term of their continuance &s;hould be prolonged for one and twenty years; and their &s;tock of two millions, two hundred and one thou&s;and one hundred and &s;eventy-one pounds, &s;hould be doubled by a new &s;ub&s;cription.

<P>Great debates having ari&s;en about Scotti$h elections, the hou&s;e con&s;idered the petitions and repre&s;entations that were delivered, touching the in|capacity of the elde&s;t &s;ons of Scotti&s;h peers, excluded from &s;itting in the parlia|ment of Great-Britain. Coun&s;el being heard upon the &s;ubject, that incapacity was confirmed; and new writs were i&s;&s;ued, that new members might be elected for the &s;hires of Aberdeen and Linlithgow, in the room of William lord Haddo, and James lord John&s;town. Petitions were likewi&s;e pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e of lords by &s;ome Scotti&s;h peers, concerning their right of voting, and &s;igning proxies. After warm debates, the hou&s;e upon a divi&s;ion determined, that a Scotti&s;h lord created a peer of Great-Britain, &s;hould no longer retain his vote
<PB N="355" REF="3580">
in Scotland: and, that the noblemen who were in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh had a right to &s;ign proxies, after having taken the oaths to the government. The Scotti&s;h peers and commoners that &s;at in the Briti&s;h parliament, were divided into two factions. The duke of Queen&s;berry was in great credit with the queen and the lord-trea&s;urer, by who&s;e intere&s;t he was appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate for Scotland. His influence in elections was &s;o great, that all offices in that kingdom were be&s;towed according to his recommendation. He was op|po&s;ed by the dukes of Hamilton, Montro&s;e, and Roxburgh, who were &s;upported by the earl of Sunderland and lord Somers; &s;o that the whole intere&s;t in that country was engro&s;&s;ed by one or other member of the mini&s;try. A bill for a general naturalization of all prote&s;tants was brought into the hou&s;e, and not|with&s;tanding violent oppo&s;ition from the Tories both among the lords and com|mons, was enacted into a law. The Whigs argued for this bill, as a mea&s;ure that would encourage indu&s;try, improve trade and manufacture, and repa$$ the wafte of men which the war had occa&s;ioned; but one of their chief motives was to throw an addition of foreigners into the balance again&s;t the landed in|tere&s;t. The Tories pleaded, that a conflux of aliens might prove dangerous to the con&s;titution: that they would retain a fondne&s;s for their native countries, and in times of war act as &s;pies and enemies: that they would in&s;inuate them|&s;elves into places of tru&s;t and profit; become members of parliament, and by frequent intermarriages contribute to the extinction of the Engli&s;h race: that they would add to the number of the poor, already &s;o expen&s;ive; and &s;hare the bread of the labourers and trade&s;men of England.</P>

<P>An inquiry being &s;et on foot in both hou&s;es concerning the late intended inva&s;ion of Scotland, lord Haver&s;ham and the other Tory members endeavoured to demon&s;trate, that proper precautions had not been taken for the &s;ecurity of that kingdom, even after the mini&s;try had received undoubted in|telligence of the pretender's de&s;ign; and, that &s;ince the attempt had mi&s;carried, many per&s;ons of quality had been apprehended, and &s;everely u&s;ed by the go|vernment, on pretended &s;u&s;picion of high-trea&s;on; though, in all probability, the aim of the mini&s;try in confining tho&s;e per&s;ons, was to remove all po&s;&s;ibility of their oppo&s;ing the court at the en&s;uing elections for members of parliament. The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions were &s;upported by many inconte&s;ted facts and &s;hrewd arguments, notwith&s;tanding which, the majority were &s;o little di&s;po&s;ed to find fault, that the inquiry i&s;&s;ued in a joint-addre&s;s to the queen, containing re&s;olutions, That timely and effectual care had been taken to di&s;appoint the de&s;igns of her ma|je&s;ty's enemies both at home and abroad. A bill, however, was brought into the hou&s;e of lords, under the title of <Q>&startq;An act for improving the union of the two kingdoms.&endq;</Q> It related to trials for trea&s;on in Scotland, which by this law were regulated according to the manner of proceeding in England, with &s;ome &s;mall variation. The Scotti&s;h members oppo&s;ed it as an incroachment upon the form of their laws; and they were joined by tho&s;e who had layed it down as a maxim to oppo&s;e all the court-mea&s;ures: nevertherle&s;s, the bill pa&s;&s;ed thro$ both hou&s;es, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent. Yet, in order to &s;weeten this unpa|latable medicine, the queen con&s;ented to an act of grace, by which all trea&s;ons were pardoned, except tho&s;e committed on the high-&s;eas: an exception levelled at tho&s;e who had embarked with the pretender.

This motion was made by the Tories; and the Whigs did not fail to procure a compliment of the &s;ame na|ture to the duke of Marlborough, even before he returned to England. When the news of Ghent's being taken arrived, the lords and commons congratulated the queen on this la&s;t great effort of a glorious campaign; and the duke, at his arrival, was thanked in the name of the peers, by the lord-chancellor.

<P>The laws having been found in&s;ufficient to puni&s;h capitally the au|thors of the in&s;ult offered to the M$&s;covite amba&s;&s;ador, a bill was brought into the hou&s;e of commons for pre&s;erving the privileges of amba&s;&s;adors and other foreign mini&s;ters; and pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es: as did another to prevent the laying of wagers relating to the public, a practice which had been carried to a degree of infatuation; and by which many unwary per&s;ons fell a &s;acrifice to crafty adventurers. On the fourteenth day of March the commons voted the &s;um of one hundred and three thou&s;and two hundred and three pounds, for the relief of the inhabitants of Nevis and St. Chri&s;topher's, who had &s;uffered by the late inva&s;ion; and on the twenty-fir&s;t day of April the parliament was pro|rogued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$.

An information was tried at the court of queen$s-bench for her maje&s;ty again&s;t Thomas Morton laceman, and thirteen other per&s;ons concerned in the in&s;ult, of which they were found guilty; and the &s;pecial matter of the privileges of amba&s;&s;adors was to be ar|gued next term before the judges. Mean while, the queen, by way of &s;atisfac|tion to the c$ar, conde&s;cended to make &s;olemn excu&s;es by her amba&s;&s;ador; to repair Matueof's honour by a letter, and indemnify him for all his co&s;ts and damages: conce&s;&s;ions with which the czar and his amba&s;&s;ador declared them|&s;elves well &s;atisfied. The convocation had been &s;ummoned, cho&s;en, and returned with the new parliament; but as the old &s;pirit was &s;uppo&s;ed to prevail in the lower hou&s;e, the queen, by writ to the archbi&s;hop, ordered him to prorogue it from time to time, until the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was fini&s;hed.</P>

<P>THE French king was by this time reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of humi|liation by the lo&s;&s;es of the la&s;t campaign, and a &s;evere winter which completed the mi&s;ery of his &s;ubjects, that he re&s;olved to &s;acrifice all the con&s;iderations of pride and ambition, as well as the intere&s;t of his grand&s;on, to his de&s;ire of peace, which was now become &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;ible. He di&s;patched the pre&s;ident Rouill&eacute; privately to Holland, with general propo&s;als of peace, and the offer of a good barrier to the &s;tates-general, &s;till entertaining hopes of being able to detach them from the confederacy. This mini&s;ter con|ferred in &s;ecret with Buys and Vanderdu&s;&s;en, the pen&s;ionaries of Am&s;terdam and Gouda at Moerdyke, from whence he was permitted to proceed to Woerden, between Leyden and Utrecht. The &s;tates immediately communicated his pro|po&s;als
<PB N="358" REF="3610">
to the courts of Vienna and Great-Britain. Prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough arrived at the Hague in April, and conferred with he grand pen&s;ionary Hein&s;ius, Buys, and Vanderduffen, on the &s;ubject of the French propo&s;als, which were deemed un&s;atisfactory. Rouill&eacute; immediately di&s;patched a courier to Paris for further in&s;tructions; and the duke of Marlborough re|turned to England to make the queen acquainted with the progre&s;s of the ne|gotiation. Lewis, in order to convince the &s;tates of his &s;incerity, &s;ent the mar|quis de Torcy, his &s;ecretary for foreign affairs, to the Hague with fre&s;h offers, to which the deputies would make no an&s;wer until they knew the &s;entiments of the queen of Great-Britain. The duke of Marlborough cro&s;&s;ed the &s;eas a &s;e|cond time, accompanied by the lord vi&s;count Town$hend, as amba&s;&s;ador-ex|traordinary, and joint-plenipetentiary: Prince Eugene being likewi&s;e at the Hague, the conferences were begun. The French mini&s;ter declared, that his ma&s;ter would con&s;ent to the demolition of Dunki$k: that he would abandon the presender, and di&s;mi&s;s him from his dominions: that he would acknowledge the queen's title and the prote$tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: that he would renounce all pre|ten&s;ions to the Spani&s;h monarchy, and cede the places in the Netherlands which the &s;tates-general demanded for their barrier: that he would treat with the em|peror on the footing of the treaty concluded at Ry&s;wick, and even demoli&s;h the fortifications of Stra&s;burg. The mini&s;ters of the allies, rendered proud and wanton by &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;eeing their own private intere&s;t in the continuation of the war, in&s;i&s;ted upon the re&s;titution of the Upper and Lower Alface to the empire: upon the French monarch's re&s;toring Stra&s;burg in its pre&s;ent condition: upon his ceding the town and ca&s;tellany of Li$$e, demoli&s;hing Dunkirk, New Bri$ac, Fort Louis, and Hunningen. In a word, their demands were &s;o in&s;o|lent, that Lewis would not have &s;uffered them to be mentioned in his hearing, had not he been reduced to the la&s;t degree of di&s;tre&s;s. One can hardly read them without feeling a &s;entiment of compa&s;&s;ion for that monarch, who had once given law to Europe, and been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to victory and conque&s;t. Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;couraging di&s;patches he had received from the pre&s;ident Rouille, after his fir&s;t conferences with the deputies, he could not believe that the Dutch would be &s;o blind to their own intere&s;t, as to reject the advantages in commerce, and the barrier which he had offered. He could not conceive, that they would choo&s;e to bear the burthen of exce&s;&s;ive taxes in pro&s;ecuting a war, the events of which would always be uncertain, rather than enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, &s;ecurity, and advantageous commerce: he flattered him&s;elf, that the allies would not &s;o far deviate from their purpo&s;ed aim of e&s;tabli&s;hing a balance of power, as to throw &s;uch an enormous weight into the &s;cale of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which cheri&s;hedall the dangerous ambition and arbitrary principles, with|out the liberality and &s;entiment, peculiar to the hou&s;e of Bourbon. In proportion as they ro&s;e in their demands Lewis fell in his conde&s;cen&s;ion. His &s;ecretary of &s;tate, the marquis de Torcy, po&s;ted in di&s;gui&s;e to Holland, on the faith of a common blank pa&s;&s;port. He &s;ollicited, he &s;oothed, he &s;upplicated, and made conce&s;&s;ions in the name of his &s;overeign. He found the &s;tates were wholly guided by the influence of prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough. He found the&s;e generals elated, haughty, overbearing and implacable. He in pri|vate attacked the duke of Marlborough on his weake&s;t &s;ide: he offered to that nobleman a large &s;um of money, provided he would effect a peace on certain
<PB N="359" REF="3620">
conditions. The propo&s;al was rejected. The duke found his enemies in Eng|land increa&s;ing, and his credit at court in the wane; and he knew that nothing but a continuation of the war, and new victories, could &s;upport his influence in England. Torcy was &s;en&s;ible that his country was utterly exhau&s;ted: that Lewis dreaded nothing &s;o much as the opening of the campaign; and he agreed to tho&s;e articles upon$ which they in&s;i&s;ted as preliminaries. The French king was confounded at the&s;e propo&s;als: he felt the complicated pangs of grief, &s;hame, and indignation. He rejected the preliminaries with di&s;dain. He even deigned to &s;ubmit his conduct to the judgment of his &s;ubjects. His offers were publi&s;hed, together with the demands of the allies. His people intere&s;ted them&s;elves in the glory of their monarch. They exclaimed again&s;t the cruelty and arrogance of his enemies. Though impoveri&s;hed and half-&s;tarved by the war, they re&s;olved to expend their whole &s;ub&s;tance in his &s;upport; and rather to fight his battles without pay, than leave him in the dire nece&s;&s;ity of com|plying with &s;uch di&s;honourable terms. Animated by the&s;e &s;entiments, they made &s;uch efforts as amazed the whole world. The preliminaries being rejected by the French king, Rouill&eacute; was ordered to quit Holland in four and twenty hours; and the generals of the confederates re&s;olved to open the campaign with|out farther he&s;itation.</P>

<P>Prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough proceeded to Flanders, and towards the end of June the allied army encamped in the plain of Li&s;le$ to the number of one hundred and ten thou&s;and fighting men. At the &s;ame time, the marechal Villars, accounted the mo&s;t fortunate general in France, a&s;&s;embled the French forces in the plain of Lens, where he began to throw up intrenchments. The confederate generals having ob&s;erved his &s;ituation, and perceiving he could not be attacked with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s, re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege of Tournay, the garri&s;on of which Villars had impru|dently weakened. Accordingly they made a feint upon Ypres, in order to de|ceive the enemy, and convert all their attention to that &s;ide, while they &s;ud|denly inve&s;ted Tournay on the twenty-&s;eventh day of June. Though the garri&s;on did not exceed twelve weakened battalions, and four &s;quadrons of dragoons$ the place was &s;o &s;trong, both by art and nature, and lieutenant de Surville the governor was &s;uch an excellent officer, that the &s;iege was protracted, con|trary to the expectation of the allies, and co&s;t them a great number of men, notwith&s;tanding all the precautions that could be taken for the &s;afety of the troops. As the be&s;iegers proceeded by the method of &s;ap, their miners fre|quently met with tho&s;e of the enemy under ground, and fought with bayonet and pi&s;tol. The volunteers on both &s;ides pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the&s;e &s;ub|terraneous combats, in the mid&s;t of mines and countermines ready primed for explo&s;ion. Sometimes they were kindled by accident, and &s;ometimes &s;prung by de&s;ign; &s;o that great numbers of tho&s;e brave men were &s;tifled below; and whole battalions blown into the air, or buried in the rubbi&s;h. On the twenty eighth day of July, the be&s;iegers having effected a practicable breach, and made the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions for a general a&s;&s;ault, the enemy offered to capitulate: the town was &s;urrendered upon conditions, and the garri&s;on retired to the cita|del. Surville likewi&s;e entered into a treaty about giving up the citadel; and the articles being &s;ent to the court of Ver&s;ailles, Lewis would not ratify them, except upon condition that there &s;hould be a general ce&s;&s;ation in the Nether|lands
<PB N="360" REF="3630">
till the fifth day of September. Ho&s;tilities were renewed on the eighth day of Augu&s;t, and pro&s;ecuted with uncommon ardour and animo&s;ity. On the thirtieth, Surville de&s;ired to capitulate on certain articles, which were re|jected by the duke of Marlborough, who gave him to under&s;tand that he had no terms to expect, but mu&s;t &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. At length, his provi&s;ion being quite exhau&s;ted, he was obliged to &s;urrender him&s;elf and his garri&s;on pri&s;oners of war, though they were permitted to return to France, on giving their parole that they would not act in the field until a like number of the allies &s;hould be relea&s;ed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; III.</HEAD>
<P>The next object that attracted the eyes of the confederates, was the city of Mons, which they re&s;olved to be&s;iege with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. They pa&s;&s;ed the Schelde on the third day of September, and detached the prince of He&s;&s;e to attack the French lines, from the Hai&s;ne to the Sombre, which were abandoned at his approach. On the &s;eventh day of September$ Mar$chal de Boufflers arrived in the French camp at Quievrain, content to act in an inferior capacity to Villars, although his &s;uperior in point of &s;eniority. The duke of Marlborough having received advice that the French were on the march to attack the advanced body under the prince of He&s;&s;e, decamped from Havre, in order to &s;upport that detachment. On the ninth the allies made a motion to the left, by which the two armies were brought &s;o near each other, that a mutual cannonading en&s;ued. The French army, amounting to one hundred and twenty thou&s;and men, were po&s;ted behind the woods of La Merte and Tanieres, in the neighbourhood of Malplaquet. The confederates, nearly of the &s;ame number, encamped with the right near Sart and Bleron, and the left on the edge of the wood of Lagniere; the head-quarters being at Blaregnies. The enemy, in&s;tead of at|tacking the allies, began to fortify their camp, which was naturally &s;trong, with triple intrenchments. In a word, they were &s;o covered with lines, hedges, intrenchments, cannon, and trees laid acro&s;s, that they &s;eemed to be quite inacce&s;&s;ible. Had the confederates attacked them on the ninth, the battle would not have been &s;o bloody, and the victory would have been more deci&s;ive; for they had not then begun to &s;ecure the camp: but they po&s;tponed the en|gagement until they &s;hould be reinforced by eighteen battalions which had been employed in the &s;iege of Tournay; and, in the mean time, the French fortified them&s;elves with incredible diligence and di&s;patch. On the eleventh day of September, early in the morning, the confederates, favoured by a thick fog, erected batteries on each wing, and in the centre; and about eight o'clock the weather clearing up, the attack began. Eighty-&s;ix battalions on the right, commanded by general Schuylemburg, the duke of Argyle, and other gene|rals, and &s;upported by two and twenty battalions under count Lottum, at|tacked the left of the enemy with &s;uch vigour, that notwith&s;tanding their lines and barricadoes, they were in le&s;s than an hour driven from their intrench|ments, into the woods of Sart and Tanieres. The prince of Orange and baron Fagel, with &s;ix and thirty Dutch battalions, advanced again&s;t the right of the enemy, po&s;ted in the wood of la Merte, and covered with three intrenchments. Here the battle was maintained with the mo&s;t de&s;perate courage on both &s;ides. The Dutch obliged the French to quit the fir&s;t intrenchment; but were repul&s;ed from the &s;econd with great &s;laughter. The prince of Orange per|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="361" REF="3640">
in his efforts with incredible per&s;everance and intrepidity, even after two hor&s;es had been killed under him$ and the greater part of his officers either &s;lain or di&s;abled. The French fought with an ob&s;tinacy of courage that bordered on de&s;pair, till &s;eeing their lines forced, their left wing and centre giving way, and their general Villars dangerou&s;ly wounded, they made an excellent retreat towards Bavay, under the conduct of Boufflers, and took po&s;t between Que&s;noy and Valenciennes. The field of battle they abandoned to the confederates, with about forty colours and &s;tandards, &s;ixteen pieces of artillery, and a good num|ber of pri&s;oners: but this was the deare&s;t victory they had ever purcha&s;ed. Above twenty thou&s;and of their be&s;t troops were killed in the engagement; whereas the enemy did not lo&s;e half the number, and retired at lei&s;ure, per|fectly recovered of that apprehen&s;ion with which they had been for &s;ome years in&s;pired and overawed by the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of their adver&s;aries. On the &s;ide of the allies, count Lottam, general Tettau, count Oxien&s;tern, and the marquis of Tullibardine were killed, with many other officers of di&s;tinction. Prince Eu|gene was &s;lightly wounded on the head: lieutenant-general Webb received a &s;hot in the groin. The duke of Argyle, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by ex|traordinary feats of valour, e&s;caped unhurt; but &s;everal mu&s;ket-balls pene|trated through his cloaths, hat, and periwig. In the French army, the chevalier de St. George charged twelve times with the hou&s;hold troops, and in the la&s;t was wounded with a &s;word in the arm. The marechal Villars con|fidently a&s;&s;erted, that if he him&s;elf had not been di&s;abled, the confederates would have certainly been defeated.</P>

<P>Con&s;idering the &s;ituation of the French, the number of their troops, and the manner in which they were fortified, nothing could be more ra&s;h and imprudent than the attack, which co&s;t the lives of &s;o many gallant men, and was attended with &s;o little advantage to the conquerors. Perhaps the duke of Marlborough thought a victory was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport his &s;inking intere&s;t at the court of Great Britain. His intention was to have given battle before the enemy had intrenched them&s;elves; but prince Eugene in&s;i&s;ted upon delaying the action until the reinforcement &s;hould arrive from Tournay: and the extraordinary carnage is imputed to the impetuo&s;ity of the prince of Orange, who&s;e aim, through this whole war, was to rai&s;e him&s;elf into con&s;ideration with the &s;tates-general, by &s;ignal acts of military prowe&s;s. The French having re|tired to Valenciennes, the allies were left at liberty to be&s;iege Mons, which capitulated about the end of October; and both armies were di&s;tributed in winter-quarters. The campaign on the Rhine produced nothing but one &s;harp action, between a detachment of the French army commanded by the count de Borgh, and a body of troops under count Merci, who had pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in order to penetrate into Franche-comt&eacute;. He was wor&s;ted in this encounter, with the lo&s;s of two thou&s;and men; obliged to repa&s;s the river, and retired to Fribourg. In Piedmont, velt-marechal Thaun commanded the confederates, in the room of the duke of Savoy, who refu&s;ed to take the field until &s;ome differences which had ari&s;en between the emperor and him &s;hould be adju&s;ted. Thuan's de&s;ign was to be&s;iege Briancon; but the duke of Ber|wick had taken &s;uch precautions as fru&s;trated his intention, though part of the troops under the French general were employed in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing an in&s;urrection of the Cami&s;ars, and other malcontents in the Vivarez. The&s;e were intirely de|feated

<P>Though the events of the &s;ummer had been le&s;s unfavourable to $rance than $word$ had r$$&s;on to expect, he &s;aw that peace was as nece&s;&s;ary as ever to his kingdom; but he thought he might now treat with &s;ome freedom and dignity. His min$&s;$er Tor$y maintained a corre&s;pondence with Mr. Petkum re&s;ident of the duke of Hol&s;tein at the Hague: he propo&s;ed to this mini&s;ter, that the negotiation &s;hould be renewed; and demanded pa&s;&s;es, by virtue of which the French pleni$oten$iaries might repair in &s;afety to Holland. In the mean time, the French king withdrew his troops from Spain, on pretence of demon&s;trating his read$ne&s;s to oblige the allies in that particular; though this mea&s;ure was the effect of nece&s;&s;ity, which obliged him to recall tho&s;e troops for the defence of his own dominions. The &s;tates-general refu&s;ed to grant pa&s;&s;es to the French mini&s;ters; but they allowed Petkum to make a journey to Ver|&s;ailles. In the interim king Philip publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, prote&s;ting again&s;t all that &s;hould be tran&s;ac$ed at the Hague to his prejudice. Far from yield|ing Spain and the Indies to his competitor, he declared his intention of driving Charles from tho&s;e places that were now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He named the duke of Alba and count Bergheyck for his plenipotentiaries, and ordered them to notify their credentials to the maritime powers: but no regard was payed to their intimation. Philip tampered likewi&s;e with the duke of Marlborough, and the marquis de Torcy renewed his attempts upon that general: but all his application and addre&s;s proved ineffectual. Petkum brought back from Ver&s;ailles a kind of memorial, importing, That tho&s;e motives which influenced the French, before the campaign was opened, no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ted: That the winter &s;ea&s;on naturally produced a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, during which he would treat of a general and rea&s;onable peace, without re&s;tricting him&s;elf to the form of the preliminaries which the allies had pretended to impo&s;e: That, never|thele&s;s, he would &s;till treat on the foundation of tho&s;e conditions to which he had con&s;ented, and &s;end plenipotentiaries to begin the conferences with tho&s;e of the allies, on the fir&s;t day of January. The &s;tates-general inveighed again&s;t this memorial, as a proof of the French king's in&s;incerity; though he cer|tainly had a right to retract tho&s;e offers they had formerly rejected. They came to a re&s;olution, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pro&s;ecute the war with vigour; and they wrote p$e&s;&s;ing letters on this &s;ubject to all their allies.</P>

<P>The parliament of Great-Britain being a&s;&s;embled on the fifteenth day of November, the queen in her &s;peech told both hou&s;es, That the enemy had endeavoured, by fal&s;e appearances, and deceitful in&s;inuations of a de&s;ire after peace, to create jealou&s;ies among the allies: That God Almighty had been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s the arms of the con&s;ederates with a mo&s;t remarkable victory, and other &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which had laid France open to the impre&s;&s;ion of the allied arms, and con&s;equently rendered peace more nece&s;&s;ary to that kingdom than it was at the beginning of the campaign. She in&s;i&s;ted upon the expediency of pro&s;$cuting the advantages &s;he had gained; by reducing that exorbitant and oppr$$$ive power which had &s;o long threatened the liberties of Europe. The parliament were as eager and compliant as ever. They pre&s;ented congratula|tory addre&s;&s;es: they thanked the duke of Marlborough for his &s;ignal &s;ervices;
<PB N="364" REF="3670">
w$ile great part of the nation reproached him with having wantonly &s;acrificed &s;o many thou&s;and lives to his own private intere&s;t and reputation. In le&s;s than a month, the commons granted upwards of &s;ix millions for the &s;ervice of the en$uing year; and e&s;tabli&s;hed a lottery, with other funds, to an&s;wer this enor|mous &s;upply. On the thirteenth day of December, Mr. Dolben, &s;on to the late archbi&s;hop of York$ complained to the hou&s;e, of two &s;ermons preached and publi&s;hed by Dr. Henry Sacheverel, rector of St. Saviour's in Southwark, as contai$ing po&s;itions contrary to revolution-principles, to the pre&s;ent govern|ment, and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Sacheverel was a clergyman of narrow in|t$llects, and an over-heated imagination. He had acquired &s;ome popularity among tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by the name of High-churchmen; and took all occa&s;ions to vent his animo&s;ity again&s;t the di&s;&s;enters. At the &s;ummer-a$$izes at Derby, he had held forth in that &s;train before the judges: on the fifth day of November, in St. Paul's church, he, in a violent declama|tion, defended the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance; inveighed again&s;t the toleration and di$$enters; declared the church was dangerou&s;ly attacked by her enemies; and $lightly defended by her fal&s;e friends: he &s;ounded the trumpet for the chur$h, and exhorted the people to put on the whole armour of God. Sir Sa|muel Garrard the lord-mayor, countenanced this harrangue, which was pu|bli&s;hed under his protection, extolled by the Tories, and circulated all over the nation. The complaint of Mr. Dolben again&s;t Sacheverel was &s;econded in the hou&s;e of commons, by Sir Peter King, and other members. The mo&s;t violent paragraphs were read: the &s;ermons were voted &s;candalous and &s;editi|ous libels. Sacheverel being brought to the bar of the hou&s;e, acknowledged him&s;elf the author of both, and mentioned the encouragement he had re|ceived from the lord-mayor to print that which was intituled, "The perils of fal&s;e brethren." Sir Samuel, who was a member, denied he had ever given him &s;uch encouragement. The doctor being ordered to withdraw, the hou&s;e re&s;olved he &s;hould be impeached of high crimes and mi&s;demeanours; and Mr. Dolben was ordered to impeach him at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords, in the name of all the commons of England. A committee was appointed to draw up articles, and Sacheverel was taken into cu&s;tody. At the &s;ame time, in order to demon&s;trate their own principles, they re&s;olved, That the reverend Mr. Ben$amin Hoadly, rector of St. Peter's Poor, for having often ju&s;tified the principles on which her maje&s;ty and the nation proceeded in the late happy revolution, had ju&s;tly merited the favour and recommendation of the hou&s;e; and they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the queen, be&s;eeching her to be&s;tow &s;ome dig|nity in the church on Mr. Hoadly, for his eminent &s;ervices both to the church and &s;tate. The queen returned a civil an&s;wer, though &s;he payed no regard to their recommendation. Hoadly was a clergyman of $ound under&s;tanding, un|blemi&s;hed character, and uncommon moderation, who, in a &s;ermon preached before the lord-mayor of London, had demon&s;trated the lawfulne&s;s of re&s;i&s;t|ing wicked and cruel governors; and vindicated the late revolution. By avowing &s;uch doctrines, he incurred the re&s;entment of the high-churchmen, who accu&s;ed him of having preached up rebellion. Many books were written again&s;t the maxims he profe&s;&s;ed. The&s;e he an&s;wered; and, in the cour&s;e of the controver&s;y, acquitted him&s;elf with &s;uperior temper, judgment, and &s;olidity
<PB N="365" REF="3680">
of argument. He, as well as bi&s;hop Burnet, and &s;everal other prelates, had been treated with great virulence in Sacheverel's &s;ermon; and the lord|trea&s;urer was &s;currilou&s;ly abu&s;ed under the name of Volpone.</P>

<P>The doctor being impeached at the bar of the upper-hou&s;e, peti|tioned that he might be admitted to bail; but this indulgence was refu&s;ed, and the commons &s;eemed bent upon pro&s;ecuting him with &s;uch &s;everity as gave di&s;gu&s;t to men of moderate principles. Mean while the Tories were not idle. They boldly affirmed that the Whigs had formed a de&s;ign to pull down the church; and that this pro&s;ecution was intended to try their &s;trength, before they would proceed openly to the execution of their project. The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions were &s;upported, and even credited by great part of the clergy, who did not fail to alarm and inflame their hearers; while emi&s;&s;aries were employed to rai&s;e a ferment among the populace, already prepared with di&s;content, ari&s;ing from a &s;carcity which prevailed in almo&s;t every country of Europe. The&s;e mini|&s;ters magnified the dangers to which the church was expo&s;ed, from di&s;|&s;enters, whigs, and lukewarm prelates. The&s;e they repre&s;ented as the authors of a ruinous war, which in a little time would produce univer&s;al fa|mine; and, as the immediate encouragers of tho&s;e Palatine refugees who had been brought over to the number of &s;ix thou&s;and, and maintained by volun|tary contributions, until they could be conveniently tran&s;ported into Ireland, and the plantations in America. The charity be&s;towed upon tho&s;e unhappy &s;trangers exa&s;perated the poor of England, who felt &s;everely the effects of the dearth, and helped to fill up the mea&s;ure of popular di&s;content. The articles again&s;t Dr. Sacheverel being exhibited, his per&s;on was committed to the de|puty-u&s;her of the black-rod; and the lords admitted him to bail. Then he drew up an an&s;wer to the charge, in which he denied &s;ome articles, and others he endeavoured to ju&s;tify or extenuate. The commons having &s;ent up a re|plication, declaring they were ready to prove the charge, the lords appointed the twenty-&s;eventh day of February for the trial, in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall.</P>

<P>The eyes of the whole kingdom were turned upon this extraordinary trial. It la&s;ted three weeks, during which all other bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;u&s;pended; and the queen her&s;elf was every day pre&s;ent, though in quality of a private &s;pectator. The managers for the commons were Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl, Mr. Eyre &s;ollicitor-general, Sir Peter King recorder of the city of London, lieutenant-general Stanhope, Sir Thomas Parker, and Mr. Robert Walpole trea&s;urer of the navy. The doctor was defended by Sir Simon Harcourt and Mr. Phipps, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Dr. Atterbury, Dr. Smallridge, and Dr. Friend. A va&s;t mul|titude attended him every day to and from We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, &s;triving to ki&s;s his hand, and praying for his deliverance, as if he had been a martyr and con|fe&s;&s;or. The queen's &s;edan was be&s;et by the populace, exclaiming, <Q>&startq;God ble&s;s your maje&s;ty and the church. We hope your maje&s;ty is for Dr. Sacheve|rel.&endq;</Q> They compelled all per&s;ons to lift their hats to the doctor, as he pa&s;&s;ed in his coach to the Temple, where he lodged; and, among the&s;e &s;ome members of parliament, who were abu&s;ed and in&s;ulted. They de&s;troyed &s;e|veral meeting-hou&s;es, plundered the dwelling-hou&s;es of eminent di$$enters; and threatened to pull down tho&s;e of the lord chancellor, the earl of Wharton, and the bi&s;hop of Sarum.

<P>On the tenth day of March, the lords being adjourned to their own $word$ the $a$l of $word$ propo&s;ed the following que&s;tion, <Q>&startq;Whether, in pro$$cut$ons by impeachments for high crimes and mi&s;demeanours, by writing or &s;peaking the particular $word$ &s;uppo&s;ed to be criminal, are $word$ to be $word$ &s;pecified in &s;uch impeachments?&endq;</Q> The judges being $span$ of opinion, that, according to law, the grounds $span$ ought to be expre&s;$$y mentioned in both.

On the &s;ixteenth day of the month, the queen being in the hou&s;e incognito, they proceed|ed to con&s;ider whether or not the commons had made good the articles exhibited again&s;t Dr. Sach$verel. The earl of $word$ ob&s;erved, that the doctor's &s;peech was $word$ full $word$ and $word$ of his &s;ermon: that all he had advanced about non-re&s;i&s;tance and unlimited obedience was fal&s;e and ridiculous: that the $word$ of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, as urged by the doctor, was not reconcileable to the $word$ of $word$ that if the revolution was not lawful, many in that $word$ and va&s;t numbers without, were guilty of blood, murder, rapine, and $word$ and that the queen her&s;elf was no lawful &s;overeign, &s;ince the be&s;t title &s;he had to the $span$ founded upon the revolution. He
<PB N="367" REF="3700">
was an&s;wered by the lord Haver&s;ham in a long &s;peech. Lord Ferrers &s;aid, if the doctor was guilty of &s;ome fooli&s;h unguarded expre&s;&s;ions, he ought to have been tried at common law. The earl of Scarborough ob&s;erved, the revolution was a nice point, and above the law: he moved that they &s;hould adjourn the debate, and take time to con&s;ider before they gave judgment. Doctor Hooper bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells allowed the nece&s;&s;ity and legality of re&s;i&s;tance in &s;ome extraordinary ca&s;es; but was of opinion, that this maxim ought to be concealed from the knowledge of the people, who are naturally too apt to re|&s;i&s;t: that the revolution was not to be boa&s;ted of, nor made a precedent; but that a mantle ought to be thrown over it, and it &s;hould be called a vacancy or abdication. He &s;aid the original compact were dangerous words$ not to be mentioned without great caution: that tho&s;e who examined the revolution too nicely, were no friends to it: and that there &s;eemed to be a nece&s;&s;ity for preach|ing up non-re&s;i&s;tance and pa&s;&s;ive obedience at that time, when re&s;i&s;tance was ju&s;tified. The duke of Argyle affirmed, that the clergy in all ages had de|livered up the rights and privileges of the people, preaching up the king's power, in order to govern him the more ea&s;ily; and therefore they o$$$t not to be &s;uffered to meddle with politics. The earl of Angle&s;ey owned the doctor had preached non&s;en&s;e; but &s;aid that was no crime. The duke of Leeds di&s;tin|gui&s;hed between re&s;i&s;tance and revolution; for, had not the la&s;t &s;ucceeded, it would have certainly been rebellion, &s;ince he knew of no other but hereditary right. The bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury ju&s;tified re&s;i&s;tance from the book of Macca|b$es: he mentioned the conduct of queen Elizabeth, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Scots, the French, and the &s;tates-general, in re&s;i&s;ting their different &s;overeigns, and was &s;upported in this practice both by her parliaments and her convocations. He ob&s;erved that king Charles I. had a&s;&s;i&s;ted the citizens of Rochelle in their rebellion: that Manwaring incurred a &s;evere cen&s;ure from the parliament, for having broached the doctrine of the divine right of kings; and that though this became a favourite maxim after the re&s;toration, yet its warme&s;t a&s;&s;erters were the fir&s;t who pleaded for re&s;i&s;tance when they thought them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed. The archbi&s;hop of York, the duke of Buckingham, and other leaders of the Tory-intere&s;t, declared that they never read &s;uch a piece of madne&s;s and non&s;en&s;e as Sachever$l's &s;ermon; but they did not think him guilty of a mi&s;demeanour. Next day, Dr. Wake bi&s;hop of Lincoln accu&s;ed Sacheverel of having made a &s;trange and fal&s;e repre&s;entation of the de&s;ign for a comprehen&s;ion, which had been &s;et on foot by archbi&s;hop Sancroft, and promoted by the mo&s;t eminent $word$ of the church of England. He was of opinion that &s;ome &s;tep &s;hould be taken for putting a &s;top to &s;uch preaching, as, if not timely corrected, might kindle heats and animo&s;ities that would endanger both church and &s;tate. Dr. Trimn$l bi&s;hop of Norwich expatiated upon the in&s;olence of Sacheverel, who had arraigned archbi&s;hop Grindal, one of the eminent reformers, as a perfidi|ous prelate, for having favoured and tolerated the di&s;cipline of Geneva. He enlarged upon the good effects of the toleration. He took notice of Sacheve|rel's pre&s;umption in publi&s;hing inflammatory prayers, declaring him&s;elf under per&s;ecution, while he was pro&s;ecuted for offending again&s;t the law, by tho&s;e who in common ju&s;tice ought to be thought the faire&s;t accu&s;ers, and before th$ir $word$ who were ju&s;tly acknowledged to be the mo&s;t impartial judges. In $word$ the fourth article, the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury &s;poke with great velie|mence
<PB N="368" REF="3710">
again&s;t Sacheverel, who, by inveighing again&s;t the revolution, tolera|tion, and union, &s;eemed to arraign and attack the queen her&s;elf; &s;ince her maje&s;ty had &s;o great a &s;hare in the fir&s;t; had often declared &s;he would main|tain the &s;econd; and that &s;he looked upon the third as the mo&s;t glorious event of her reign. He affirmed, that nothing could be more plain than the doctor's reflecting upon her maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters; and that he had &s;o well marked out a noble peer there pre&s;ent, by an ugly and &s;currilous epithet which he would not repeat, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take his meaning. Some of the younger peers could not help laughing at this unde&s;igned &s;arca&s;m upon the lord-trea&s;urer, whom Sacheverel had reviled under the name of Volpone: they exclaimed, "Name him, name him;" and, in all probability, the zealous bi&s;hop, who was remarkable for ab&s;ence of mind and unguarded expre&s;&s;ions, would have gra|tified their reque&s;t, had not the chancellor interpo&s;ing, declared that no peer was obliged to &s;ay more than he &s;hould think proper.</P>

<P>After ob&s;tinate di&s;putes and much virulent altercation, Sacheverel was found guilty by a majority of &s;eventeen voices; and four and thirty peers entered a prote&s;t again&s;t this deci&s;ion. He was prohibited from preaching for the term of three years: $i$ two &s;ermons were ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hangman, in pre&s;ence of the lord mayor and the two &s;heriffs of London and Middle&s;ex. The lords likewi&s;e voted that the executioner &s;hould commit to the &s;ame fire the famous decree pa&s;&s;ed in the convocation of the uni|ver&s;ity of Oxford, a&s;&s;erting the ab&s;olute authority and indefea&s;ible right of princes.

The lenity of the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon Sacheverel, which was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the dread of popular re&s;entment, his friends con&s;idered<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

She declared that no prince could have a more true and tender concern for the welfare and pro&s;perity of the church than &s;he had, and &s;hould always have; and &s;he &s;aid it was very in|jurious to take a pretence from wicked and malicious libels, to in&s;inuate that the church was in danger by her admini&s;tration.</P>

<P>The French king &s;eeing the mi&s;ery of his people daily increa&s;e, and all his re&s;ources fail, humbled him&s;elf again before the allies, and by the means of Petkum, who &s;till corre&s;ponded with his mini&s;ters, implored the &s;tates-general, that the negotiation might be re&s;umed. In order to facilitate their con&s;ent, he di&s;patched a new project of pacification, in which he promi&s;ed to renounce his grand&s;on, and to comply with all their other demands, provided the electors of Cologne and Bavaria &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in their e&s;tates and dignities. The&s;e overtures being rejected, another plan was offered, and communicated to the plenipotentiaries of the emperor and queen of Great-Britain. Then Petkum wrote a letter to the marquis de Torcy, intimating, that the allies re|quired his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty &s;hould declare in plain and expre&s;&s;ive terms,

He &s;ignified his con&s;ent, and appointed the marechal D'Uxelles and the abb&eacute; Polignae his ple$ipotentiaries. They were not &s;uffered, however, to enter Holland, but were met by the de|puties Buys and Vanderdu&s;&s;en at Gertruydenberg. Mean while, the &s;tates de|&s;ired the queen of England to &s;end over the duke of Marlborough to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with his advice on the&s;e conferences. The two hou&s;es of parliament &s;e|conded their reque&s;t in a joint-addre&s;s to her maje&s;ty, who told them &s;he had al|ready given directions for his departure; and &s;aid, &s;he was glad to find they concurred with her in a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the duke's eminent &s;ervices. Both the letter and the addre&s;s were procured by the intere&s;t of Marlborough, to let the queen &s;ee how much that nobleman was con&s;idered both at home and abroad. But &s;he was already wholly alienated from him in her heart, and the&s;e expedi|ents &s;erved only to increa&s;e her di&s;gu&s;t.</P>

<P>The French mini&s;ters were &s;ubjected to every &s;pecies of mortifica|tion. They were in a manner confined to a &s;mall fortified town, and all their conduct narrowly watched. Their accommodation was mean$ their letters were opened; and they were daily in&s;ulted by injurious libels. The Dutch de|puties would hear of no relaxation, and no expedient for removing the difficul|ties that retarded the negotiation. In vain the plenipotentiaries declared, that the French king could not with decency, or the lea&s;t regard to his honour, wage war again&s;t his own grand&s;on: the deputies in&s;i&s;ted upon his effecting the ce&s;|&s;ion of Spain and the Indies to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and &s;ubmitting to every other article &s;pecified in the preliminaries. Nay, they even re&s;erved to them&s;elves a power of making ulterior demands after the preliminaries &s;hould be adju&s;ted. Lewis propo&s;ed, that &s;ome &s;mall provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for the duke of Anjou, which might induce him to relinqui&s;h Spain the more ea&s;ily. He mentioned the kingdom of Arragon; and this hint being di&s;agreeable to the allies, he demanded Naples and Sicily. When they urged, that Naples was already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, he re&s;tricted the provi&s;ion to Sicily and Sardinia. He offered to deliver up four cautionary towns in Flanders, as a &s;ecurity for Philip's evacuating Spain; and even promi&s;ed to &s;upply the confe|derates with a monthly &s;um of money, to defray the expence of expelling that prince from his dominions, &s;hould he refu&s;e to re&s;ign them with a good grace. The &s;ub&s;tance of all the conferences was communicated to lord Town&s;hend and count Zinzendorf, the Imperial plenipotentiary; but the conduct of the de|puties was regulated by the pen&s;ionary Hein&s;ius, who was firmly attached to prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough, more aver&s;e than ever to a pacification. The negotiation la&s;ted from the nineteenth day of March to the twenty-fifth of July, during which term the conferences were &s;everal times interrupted, and a great many di&s;patches and new propo&s;als arrived from Ver|&s;ailles. At length, the plenipotentiaries returned to France, after having &s;ent a letter to the pen&s;ionary, in which they declared, that the propo&s;als made by the deputies were unju&s;t and impracticable; and complained of the unworthy treatment to which they had been expo&s;ed. Lewis re&s;olved to hazard another
<PB N="370" REF="3730">
campaign, not without hope, that there might be &s;ome lucky incident in the events of war, and that the approaching revolution in the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, of which he was well appri&s;ed, would be productive of a more rea&s;onable pacification. The &s;tates-general re&s;olved, That the enemy had departed from the foundation on which the negotiation had begun, and &s;tudied pretences to evade the execu|tion of the capital points, the re&s;titution of Spain and the Indies; and in &s;hort, that France had no other view than to &s;ow and create jealou&s;y and di&s;union among the allies. Lord Town&s;hend, in a memorial a&s;&s;ured them, that the queen intirely approved their re&s;olution, and all the &s;teps they had taken in the cour&s;e of the negotiation; and, that &s;he was firmly re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the war with all po&s;&s;ible vigour, until the enemy &s;hould accept &s;uch terms of peace as might &s;ecure the tranquillity of the chri&s;tian world.</P>

<P>The conferences did not retard the operations of the campaign. Prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough &s;et out from the Hague on the fifteenth day of March for Tournay, in order to a&s;&s;emble the forces which were quartered on the Mae&s;e, in Flanders, and Brabant. On the twentieth of April they &s;uddenly advanced to Pont a-Vendin, in order to attack the lines upon which the French had been at work all the winter, hoping by the&s;e to cover Doway and other frontier towns, which were threatened by the confede|rates. The troops left for the defence of the lines retired without oppo&s;ition. The allies having layed bridges over the Scarpe, the duke of Marlborough with his divi&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed that river, and encamped at Vitri. Prince Eugene remained on the other &s;ide and inve&s;ted Doway, the enemy retiring towards Cambray. Marechal Villars &s;till commanded the French army, which was extremely nu|merous and well appointed, con&s;idering the di&s;tre&s;s of that kingdom. Indeed, the number was augmented by this di&s;tre&s;s; for, many thou&s;ands &s;aved them|&s;elves from dying of hunger by carrying arms in the &s;ervice. The marechal having a&s;&s;embled all his forces, pa&s;&s;ed the Schelde, and encamped at Bouchain, declaring, that he would give battle to the confederates: an alteration was im|mediately made in the di&s;po&s;ition of the allies, and proper precautions taken for his reception. He advanced in order of battle; but having viewed the &s;ituation of the confederates, he marched back to the heights of St. Laurence, where he fixed his camp. His aim was by continual alarms to interrupt the &s;iege of Doway, which was vigorou&s;ly defended by a numerous garri&s;on, under the com|mand of mon&s;ieur Albergotti, who made a number of &s;ucce&s;sful &s;allies, in which the be&s;iegers lo&s;t a great number of men. They were likewi&s;e repul&s;ed in &s;everal a&s;&s;aults; but &s;till proceeded with unremitting vigour, until the be&s;ieged being reduced to the la&s;t extremity, were obliged to capitulate on the twenty-&s;ixth of June, fifty days after the trenches had been opened. The generals finding it impracticable to attack the enemy, who were po&s;ted within &s;trong lines from Arras towards Miramont, re&s;olved to be&s;iege Bethune, which was inve&s;ted on the fifteenth day of July, and &s;urrendered on the twenty-ninth of Augu&s;t. Villars marched out of his intrenchments with a view to rai&s;e the &s;iege; but he did not think proper to hazard an engagement: &s;ome warm &s;kirmi&s;hes, however, happened between the foragers of the two armies. After the reduction of Bethune, the allies be&s;ieged at one time the towns of Aire and St. Venant, which were taken without much difficulty. Then the armies broke up and marched into winter-quarters.</P>

<P>The campaign on the Rhine was productive of no military event: nor was any thing of con&s;equence tran&s;acted in Piedmont. The duke of Savoy being indi&s;po&s;ed and out of humour, the command of the forces &s;till continued ve&s;ted in count Thaun, who endeavoured to pa&s;s the Alps and penetrate into Dauphin&eacute;; but the duke of Berwick had ca&s;t up intrenchments in the mountains, and taken &s;uch precautions to guard them, as baffled all the attempts of the Im|perial general. Spain was much more fruitful of military incidents. The hor&s;e and dragoons in the army of king Charles, headed by general Stanhope, at|tacked the whole cavalry of the enemy at Almennara. Stanhope charged in per&s;on, and with his own hand &s;lew general Ame&s;&s;aga, who commanded the guards of Philip. The Spani&s;h hor&s;e were intirely routed, together with nine battalions that e&s;caped by favour of the darkne&s;s; and the main body of the army retired with precipitation to Lerida. General Staremberg pur&s;ued them to Sarago&s;&s;a, where he found them drawn up in order of battle; and an engagement en&s;uing on the ninth day of Augu&s;t, the enemy was totally defeated: five thou&s;and of their men were killed, &s;even thou&s;and taken, together with all their artillery, and a great number of colours and &s;tandards. King Charles entered Sarago&s;&s;a in triumph, while Philip with the wreck of his army retreated to Madrid. Hav|ing &s;ent his queen and &s;on to Victoria, he retired to Valladolid, in order to collect his &s;cattered troops &s;o as to form another army. The good fortune of Charles was of &s;hort duration. Stanhope propo&s;ed, that he &s;hould immediately &s;ecure Pampeluna, the only pa&s;s by which the French king could &s;end troops to Spain. But this &s;alutary &s;cheme was rejected, and king Charles proceeded to Madrid, which was de&s;erted by all the grandees; and he had the mortification to &s;ee that the Ca&s;tilians were univer&s;ally attached to his competitor.</P>

<P>While his forces continued cantoned in the neighbourhood of Toledo, the king of France, at the reque&s;t of Philip, &s;ent the duke of Vendome to take the command of the Spani&s;h army, which was at the &s;ame time reinforced by detachments of French troops. Vendome's reputation was &s;o high, and his per&s;on &s;o beloved by the &s;oldiery, that his pre&s;ence was almo&s;t equivalent to an army. A great number of volunteers immediately a&s;&s;embled to &s;ignalize them|&s;elves under the eye of this renowned general. The Ca&s;tilians were in&s;pired with fre&s;h courage, and made &s;urpri&s;ing efforts in favour of their &s;overeign; &s;o that in le&s;s than theee months after his defeat at Sarago&s;&s;a, he was in a condition to go in que&s;t of his rival. Charles, on the other hand, was totally neglected by the courts of Vienna and Great Britain, which took no &s;teps to &s;upply his wants, or enable him to pro&s;ecute the advantages he had gained. In the begin|ning of November his army marched back to Sarago&s;&s;a, and was cantoned in the neighbourhood of Cifuentes, where Staremberg e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters. General Stanhope with the Briti&s;h forces was quartered in the little town of Brihuega, where, on the twenty-&s;eventh day of the month he found him&s;elf &s;uddenly &s;urrounded by the whole Spani&s;h army. As the place was not tena|ble, and he had very little ammunition, he was obliged, after a &s;hort, but vigo|rous re&s;i&s;tance, to capitulate, and &s;urrender him&s;elf and all his forces pri&s;oners of war, to the amount of two thou&s;and men, including three lieutenant-generals, one major-general, one brigadier, with all the colonels and officers of the re|&s;pective regiments. He was greatly cen&s;ured for having allowed him&s;elf to be &s;urpri&s;ed; for, if he had placed a guard upon the neighbouring hills, according
<PB N="372" REF="3750">
to the advice of general Carpenter, he might have received notice of the enemy's approach time enough to retire to Cifuentes. Thither he detached his aid du|camp with an account of his &s;ituation, on the appearance of the Spani&s;h army; and Staremberg immediately a&s;&s;embled his forces. About eleven in the fore|noon they began to march towards Brihuega; but the roads were &s;o bad, that night overtook them before they reached the heights in the neighbourhood of that place. Staremberg is &s;aid to have loitered away his time unnece&s;|&s;arily, from motives of envy to the Engli&s;h general, who had &s;urrendered before his arrival. The troops lay all night on their arms near Villa-vicio&s;a, and on the twenty-ninth were attacked by the enemy, who doubled their number. Sta|remberg's left wing was utterly defeated, all the infantry that compo&s;ed it, hav|ing been either cut in pieces or taken; but the victors, in&s;tead of following the blow, began to plunder the baggage; and Staremberg with his right wing fought their left with &s;urpri&s;ing valour and per&s;everance till night. Then they retired in di&s;order, leaving him ma&s;ter of the field of battle and of all their artil|lery. Six thou&s;and of the enemy were killed on the &s;pot: but the allies had $uffered &s;o &s;everly that the general could not maintain his ground. He or|dered the c$$non to be nailed up, and marched to Sarago&s;&s;a, from whence he retired to Catalonia. Thither he was pur&s;ued by the duke de Vendome, who red$ced B$daguer, in which he had left a garri&s;on, and compelled him to take &s;helter under the walls of Barcelona. At this period the duke de Noailles in|ve&s;ted G$ronne, which he reduced, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the weather: &s;o that P$$l$p, from a fugitive, became in three months ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of the whose Spani&s;h monarchy, except the province of Catalonia, and even that lay open to his incur&s;ions. Nothing of con&s;equence was atchieved on the &s;ide of Portugal, from whence the earl of Galway returned to England by the queen's perm$$$ion. After the battle of Pultowa the czar of Mu&s;covy reduced all Li|von$a; but he and king Augu&s;tus agreed to a neutrality for Pomerania. The King of Sweden $word$ at Bender, and the grand &s;ignor intere&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o much in be$alf $word$ that prince, as to declare war again&s;t the emperor of Ru&s;&s;ia. Ho&s;ti$$$$es were carried on between the Swedi&s;h and Dani&s;h fleets with various &s;ucce&s;s. The malcontents in Hungary &s;u&s;tained repeated lo&s;&s;es during the &s;ummer; but they were encouraged to maintain the war by the rupture between the Ottoman Po$te and Ru$$$a. They were flattered with hopes of auxiliaries from the Turks; and expected engineers and money from the French monarch.</P>

<P>In England the effects of tho&s;e intrigues which had been formed again&s;t the Whig mini&s;ters began to appear. The trial of Sacheverel had ex|cited a popular &s;pirit of aver&s;ion to tho&s;e who favoured the di&s;&s;enters. From all parts of the kingdom addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented to the queen, cen&s;uring all re&s;i&s;tance as a rebel$$ous doctrine, founded upon antimonarchical and republican principles. At the &s;ame time counter addre&s;&s;es were procured by the Whigs, extolling the revolution, and magnifying the conduct of the pre&s;ent parliament. The queen began to expre&s;s her attachment to the Tories, by mortifying the duke of Marlborough. Upon the death of the earl of E&s;&s;ex &s;he wrote to the general, de&s;iring, that the regiment which had been commanded by that noble|man, &s;hould be given to Mr. Hill brother to Mrs. Ma&s;ham, who had &s;up|planted the dutche&s;s of Marlborough in the queen's friend&s;hip, and was in effect the &s;ource of this political revolution. The duke repre&s;ented to her maje&s;ty in
<PB N="373" REF="3760">
per&s;on, the prejudice that would redound to the &s;ervice from the promotion of &s;uch a young officer over the heads of a great many brave men, who had ex|hibited repeated proofs of valour and capacity. He expo&s;tulated with his &s;overeign on this extraordinary mark of partial regard to the brother of Mrs. Ma&s;ham, which he could not help con&s;idering as a declaration again&s;t him&s;elf and his family, who had &s;o much cau&s;e to complain of that lady's malice and ingratitude. To this remon&s;trance the queen made no other reply, but that he would do well to con&s;ult his friends. The earl of Godolphin enforced his friend's arguments, though without effect; and the duke retired in di&s;gu&s;t to Wind&s;or. The queen appeared at council without taking the lea&s;t notice of his ab&s;ence, which did not fail to alarm the whole Whig faction. Several no|blemen ventured to &s;peak to her maje&s;ty on the &s;ubject, and explain the bad con&s;equences of di&s;obliging a man who had done &s;uch eminent &s;ervices to the nation. She told them, his &s;ervices were &s;till fre&s;h in her memory; and, that &s;he retained all her former kindne&s;s for his per&s;on. Hearing, however, that a popular clamour was rai&s;ed, and that the hou&s;e of commons intended to pa&s;s &s;ome votes that would be di&s;agreeable to her and her new coun&s;ellors, &s;he or|dered the earl of Godolphin to write to the duke, to di&s;po&s;e of the regiment as he &s;hould think proper, and return to town immediately. Before he received this intimation he had &s;ent a letter to the queen, de&s;iring &s;he would permit him to retire from bu&s;ine&s;s. In an&s;wer to this petition, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, his &s;u&s;pi|cions were groundle&s;s, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his coming to council. The dutche&s;s demanded an audience of her maje&s;ty, on pretence of vindicating her own cha|racter from &s;ome a&s;per&s;ions. She hoped to work upon the queen's tenderne&s;s, and retrieve the influence &s;he had lo&s;t. She prote&s;ted, argued, wept, and &s;up|plicated: but, the queen was too well plea&s;ed with her own deliverance from the tyranny of the other's friend&s;hip, to incur &s;uch &s;lavery for the future. All the humiliation of the dutche&s;s &s;erved only to render her&s;elf the more contempt|ible. The queen heard her without exhibiting the lea&s;t &s;ign of emotion, and all &s;he would vouch&s;afe, was a repetition of the&s;e words, <Q>&startq;You de&s;ired no an&s;wer, and you &s;hall have none:&endq;</Q> alluding to an expre&s;&s;ion in a letter &s;he had re|ceived from the dutche&s;s. As an additional mortification to the mini&s;try, the office of lord chamberlain was transferred from the duke of Kent to the duke of Shrew&s;bury, who had lately voted with the Tories, and maintained an inti|macy of corre&s;pondence with Mr. Harley. The intere&s;t of the duke of Marl|borough was not even &s;ufficient to prevent the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of his own &s;on-in law the earl of Sunderland from the po&s;t of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in which he was &s;ucceeded by the lord Dartmouth.</P>

<P>The queen was generally applauded for thus a&s;&s;erting her ju&s;t prero|gative, and &s;etting her&s;elf free from an arbitrary cabal, by which &s;he had been &s;o long kept in dependence. The duke of Beaufort went to court on this occa&s;ion, and told her maje&s;ty, he was extremely glad that he could now &s;alute her queen in reality. The whole Whig party were ju&s;tly alarmed at the&s;e alterations. The directors of the bank repre&s;ented to her maje&s;ty the prejudice that would un|doubtedly accrue to public credit from a change of the mini&s;try. The emperor and the &s;tates-general interpo&s;ed in this dome&s;tic revolution. Their mini&s;ters at London pre&s;ented memorials, explaining in what manner foreign affairs would be influenced by an alteration in the Briti&s;h mini&s;try. The queen a&s;&s;ured them, that whatever changes might be made, the duke of Marlborough &s;hould
<PB N="374" REF="3770">
be continued in his employments. In the month of Augu&s;t the earl of Godol|phin was dive&s;ted of his office, and the trea&s;ury put in commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ubjected to the direction of Harley, appointed chancellor of the exchequer and under|trea&s;urer. The earl of Roche&s;ter was declared pre&s;ident of the council, in the room of lord Somers: the &s;taff of lord-&s;teward being taken from the duke of Devon&s;hire, was given to the duke of Buckingham; and Mr. Boyle was re|moved from the &s;ecretary's office, to make way for Mr. Henry St. John. The lord-chancellor having re&s;igned the great &s;eal, it was fir&s;t put in commi&s;&s;ion, and afterwards given to Sir Simon Harcourt. The earl of Wharton &s;urrendered his commi&s;&s;ion of lord-lieutenant of Ireland, which the queen conferred on the duke of Ormond. The earl of Orford withdrew him&s;elf from the board of ad|miralty; and Mr. George Granville was appointed &s;ecretary of war, in the room of Mr Robert Walpole. The command of the forces in Portugal was be&s;towed upon the earl of Portmore: the duke of Hamilton was appointed lord-lieute|nant of the county palatine of Lanca&s;ter. In a word, there was not one Whig left in any office of &s;tate, except the duke of Marlborough, who would have renounced his command, had not he been earne&s;tly di&s;&s;uaded by his particular friends, from taking &s;uch a &s;tep as might have been prejudicial to the intere&s;t of the nation. That the triumph of the Tories might be complete, the queen di&s;&s;olved the Whig parliament, after &s;uch precautions were taken as could not fail to influence the new election, in favour of the other party.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XIX.</HEAD>
<P>To this end nothing &s;o effectually contributed as did the trial of Sa|cheverel, who was u&s;ed as an in&s;trument and tool to wind and turn the pa&s;&s;ions of the vulgar. Having been pre&s;ented to a benefice in North-Wales, he went in proce&s;&s;ion to that country with all the pomp and magnificence of a &s;overeign prince. He was &s;umptuou&s;ly entertained by the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and dif|ferent noblemen, who, while they wor&s;hipped him as the idol of their faction, could not help de&s;pi&s;ing the object of their adoration. He was received in &s;everal towns by the magi&s;trates of the corporation in their formalities, and often attended by a body of a thou&s;and hor&s;e. At Bridgnorth he was met by Mr. Cre&s;|well, at the head of four thou&s;and hor&s;e, and the like number of per&s;ons on foot, wearing white knots edged with gold, and three leaves of gilt laurel in their hats. The hedges were for two miles dre&s;&s;ed with garlands of flowers, and lined with people; and the &s;teeples covered with &s;treamers, flags, and colours. No|thing was heard but the cry of "the church and Dr. Sacheverel." The clergy were actuated by a &s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;m, which &s;eemed to &s;pread like a contagion through all ranks and degrees of people, and had &s;uch effect upon the elections for the new parliament, that very few were returned as members but &s;uch as had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their zeal again&s;t the Whig admini&s;tration. Now the queen had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee all the offices of &s;tate, the lieutenancy of Lon|don, the management of corporations, and the direction of both hou&s;es of parlia|ment in the hands of the Tories. When the&s;e met on the twenty-fifth day of No|vember, Mr. Bromley was cho&s;en &s;peaker without oppo&s;ition. The queen in her &s;peech recommended the pro&s;ecution of the war with vigour, e&s;pecially in Spain. She declared her&s;elf re&s;olved to &s;upport the church of England; to pre&s;erve the Briti&s;h con&s;titution according to the union; to maintain the indulgence by law al|lowed to &s;crupulous con&s;ciences; and to employ none but &s;uch as were heartily attached to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hanover. The lords, in their addre&s;s, promi&s;ed to concur in all rea&s;onable mea&s;ures towards procuring an honourable
<PB N="375" REF="3780">
peace. The commons were more warm and hearty in their a&s;&s;urances, exhorting her maje&s;ty to di&s;countenance all &s;uch principles and mea&s;ures as had lately threatened her royal crown and dignity; mea&s;ures, which whenever they might prevail, would prove fatal to the whole con&s;titution both in church and &s;tate. After this declaration they proceeded to con&s;ider the e&s;timates, and chear|fully granted the &s;upplies for the en&s;uing year, part of which was rai&s;ed by two lotteries. In the hou&s;e of peers the earl of Scarborough moved, that the thanks of the hou&s;e &s;hould be returned to the duke of Marlborough; but the duke of Argyle made &s;ome objections to the motion, and the general's friends dreading the con&s;equence of putting the que&s;tion, po&s;tponed the con&s;ideration of this propo&s;al until the duke &s;hould return from the continent. The earl of Peterborough was appointed amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to the Imperial court: the earl of Rivers was &s;ent in the &s;ame quality to Hanover; and Mr. Richard Hill nominated envoy extraordinary to the United Provinces, as well as to the council of &s;tate appointed for the government of the Spani&s;h Netherlands, in the room of lieutenant-general Cadogan. Meredith, Macartney, and Honeywood were deprived of their regiments, becau&s;e in their cups they had drank confu|&s;ion to the enemies of the duke of Marlborough.</P>

<P>This nobleman arrived in England towards the latter end of Decem|ber. He conferred about half an hour in private with the queen, and next morning a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a committee of the privy-council. Her maje&s;ty gave him to under&s;tand, that he needed not expect the thanks of the parliament as for|merly; and told him &s;he hoped he would live well with her mini&s;ters. He expre&s;&s;ed no re&s;entment at the alterations which had been made; but re&s;olved to acquie&s;ce in the queen's plea&s;ure, and retain the command of the army on her own terms. On the &s;econd day of January the queen &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to both hou&s;es, intimating, that there had been an action in Spain to the di&s;advantage of king Charles: that the damage having fallen particularly on the Engli&s;h forces, &s;he had given directions for &s;ending and procuring troops to repair the lo&s;s, and hoped the parliament would approve her conduct. Both hou&s;es &s;eized this op|portunity of venting their &s;pleen again&s;t the old mini&s;try. The hi&s;tory of Eng|land is di&s;graced by the violent conduct of two turbulent factions, that in their turn engro&s;&s;ed the admini&s;tration and legi&s;lative power. The parliamentary &s;train was quite altered. One can hardly conceive how re&s;olutions &s;o widely different could be taken on the &s;ame &s;ubject, with any &s;hadow of rea&s;on and decorum. Marlborough, who but a few months before had been &s;o highly ex|tolled and care&s;&s;ed by the repre&s;entatives of the people, was now become the object of parliamentary hatred and cen&s;ure, though no &s;en&s;ible alteration had happened in his conduct or &s;ucce&s;s. That hero, who had retrieved the glory of the Briti&s;h arms, won &s;o many battles, &s;ubdued &s;uch a number of towns and di&s;tricts, humbled the pride, and checked the ambition of France, &s;ecured the liberty of Europe; and, as it were, chained victory to his chariot wh$$ls; was in a few weeks dwindled into an object of contempt and deri&s;ion. He was ridiculed in public libels, and reviled in private conver&s;ation. In&s;tances were every where repeated of his fraud, avarice, and extortion; his in&s;olence, cruelty, ambition, and mi&s;conduct: even his courage was called in que&s;tion; and this con&s;ummate general was repre&s;ented as the lowe&s;t of mankind. So un|&s;table is the popularity of every character that fluctuates between two oppo&s;ite tides of faction.</P>

<P>The lords in their an&s;wer to the queen's me&s;&s;age, declared, that as the misfortune in Spain might have been occa&s;ioned by &s;ome preceding mi&s;ma|nagement, they would u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to di&s;cover it, &s;o as to pre|vent the like for the future. They &s;et on foot an inquiry concerning the affairs of Spain; and the earl of Peterborough being examined before the committee, imputed all the mi&s;carriages in the cour&s;e of that war to the earl of Galway and general Stanhope. Notwith&s;tanding the defence of Galway, which was clear and convincing, the hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the earl of Peterborough had given a faithful and honourable account of the councils of war in Valencia: That the earl of Galway, the lord Tyrawley, and general Stanhope, in advi&s;ing an offen|&s;ive war, had been the unhappy occa&s;ion of the battle at Almanza, the &s;ource of our misfortunes in Spain, and one great cau&s;e of the di&s;appointment from the expedition to Toulon, concerted with her maje&s;ty. They voted, That the pro&s;ecution of an offen&s;ive war in Spain was approved and directed by the mini&s;ters, who were therefore ju&s;tly blameable, as having contributed to all our misfortunes in Spain, and to the di&s;appointment of the expe|dition again&s;t $oulon: That the earl of Peterborough, during his command in Spain, had performed many great and eminent &s;ervices; and, if his opinion had been followed, it might have prevented the misfortunes that en&s;ued. Then the duke of Buckingham moved, That the thanks of the hou&s;e &s;hould be given to the earl for his remarkable and eminent &s;ervices: and the&s;e he actually received from the mouth of the lord-keeper Harcourt, who took this opportunity to drop &s;ome oblique reflections upon the mercenary di&s;po&s;ition of the duke of Marlborough. The hou&s;e proceeding in the inquiry, pa&s;&s;ed another vote, im|porting, That the late mini&s;try had been negligent in managing the Spani&s;h war, to the great prejudice of the nation. Fineing that the Portugue&s;e troops were po&s;ted on the right of the Engli&s;h at the battle of Almanza, they re&s;olved, That the earl of Galway, in yielding this point, had acted contrary to the honour of the imperial crown of Great Britain. The&s;e re&s;olutions they included in an addre&s;s to the queen, who had been pre&s;ent during the debates, which were ex|tremely violent; and to every &s;eparate vote was attached a &s;evere prote&s;t. The&s;e were not the proceedings of candour and national ju&s;tice, but the ebullitions of party zeal and rancorous animo&s;ity.</P>

<P>While the lords were employed in this inquiry, the commons ex|amined certain abu&s;es which had crept into the management of the navy; and &s;ome cen&s;ures were pa&s;&s;ed upon certain per&s;ons concerned in contracts for vic|tualling the &s;eamen. The inhabitants of St. Olave's and other pari&s;hes pre|&s;ented a petition, complaining, that a great number of Palatines inhabiting one hou&s;e might produce among them a contagious di&s;temper; and in time be|come a charge to the public, as they were de&s;titute of all vi&s;ible means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. This petition had been procured by the Tories, that the hou&s;e of commons might have another handle for attacking the late mini&s;try. A com|mittee was appointed to inquire upon what invitation or encouragement tho&s;e Palatines had come to England. The papers relating to this affair being layed before them by the queen's order, and peru&s;ed, the hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the inviting and bringing over the poor Palatines of all religions, at the public ex|pence, was an extravagant and unrea&s;onable charge to the kingdom, and a &s;candalous mi&s;application of the public money, tending to the increa&s;e and oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, and of dangerous con&s;equence to the con&s;titution in

church and &s;tate$ and, That whatever advi&s;ed their being brought over, was an enemy to the queen and kingdom. Animated by the $eat of this inquiry, they pa&s;&s;ed the bill to repeal the act for a general naturalization of all prote&s;|tants; but this was rejected in the hou&s;e of lords. Another bill was enacted into a law, importing, That no per&s;on &s;hould be deemed qualified for repre|&s;enting a county in parliament, unle&s;s he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an e&s;tate of &s;ix hundred pounds a-year; and restricting the qualification of burge&s;s to half that &s;um. The de&s;ign of this bill was, to exclude trading people from the hou&s;e of com|mons, and to lodge the legi&s;lative power with the land-holders. A third act pa&s;&s;ed$ permitting the importation of French wine in neutral bottoms: a bill again&s;t which the Whigs loudly exclaimed, as a national evil and a &s;candalous compliment to the enemy.</P>

<P>A violent party in the hou&s;e of commons began to look upon Har|ley as a lukewarm Tory, becau&s;e he would not enter precipitately into all their factious mea&s;ures: they even began to &s;u&s;pect his principles, when his credit was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed by a very &s;ingular incident. Gui&s;card the French parti&s;an, of whom mention hath already been made, thought him&s;elf very ill rewarded for his &s;ervices with a precarious pen&s;ion of four hundred pounds, which he en|joyed from the queen's bounty. He had been renounced by St. John the for|mer companion of his plea&s;ures: he had in vain endeavoured to obtain an au|dience of the queen, with a view to demand more con&s;iderable appointments. Harley was his enemy, and all acce&s;s to her maje&s;ty was denied. Enraged at the&s;e di&s;appointments, he attempted to make his peace with the court of France, and offered his &s;ervices, in a letter to one Moreau a banker in Paris. His packet, which he endeavoured to tran&s;mit by the way of Portugal, was inter|cepted, and a warrant i&s;&s;ued out to apprehend him for high-trea&s;on. When the me&s;&s;enger di&s;armed him in St. James's park, he exhibited marks of guilty confu&s;ion and de&s;pair, and begged that he would kill him directly. Being conveyed to the Cockpit in a &s;ort of frenzy, he perceived a penknife lying upon a table, and took it up without being perceived by his attendants. A committee of council was immediately &s;ummoned, and Gui&s;card brought before them to be examined. Finding that his corre&s;pondence with Moreau was di&s;covered, he de&s;ired to &s;peak in private with &s;ecretary St. John, whom, in all probability, he had re&s;olved to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate. His reque&s;t being refu&s;ed, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;That's hard! not one word!&endq;</Q> St. John being out of his reach, he &s;tepped up to Mr. Harley, and exclaiming, "Have at thee, then," &s;tabbed him in the brea&s;t with the penknife which he had concealed. The in&s;trument broke upon the bone without penetrating into the cavity: neverthele&s;s, he repeated the blow with &s;uch force, that the chancellor of the exchequer fell to the ground. Se|cretary St. John &s;eeing him fall, cried out, <Q>&startq;The villain has killed Mr. Harley!&endq;</Q> and drew his &s;word. Several other members followed his exam|ple, and wounded Gui&s;card in &s;everal places. Yet, he made a de&s;perate defence, until he was overpowered by the me&s;&s;engers and &s;ervants, and conveyed from the council-chamber, which he had filled with terror, tumult, and confu&s;ion. His wounds, though dangerous, were not mortal; but he died of a gangrene occa&s;ioned by the brui&s;es he had &s;u&s;tained. This attempt upon the life of Harley, by a per&s;on who wanted to e&s;tabli&s;h a traiterous corre&s;pondence with France, extingui&s;hed the &s;u&s;picions of tho&s;e who began to doubt that mini&s;|ter's
<PB N="378" REF="3810">
integrity. The two hou&s;es of parliament, in an addre&s;s to the queen, de|clared their belief, that Mr. Harley's fidelity to her maje&s;ty, and zeal for her<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> &s;ervice$ had drawn upon him the hatred of all the abettors of popery and fac|tion. They be&s;ought her maje&s;ty, to take all po&s;&s;ible care of her &s;acred per&s;on; and, for that purpo&s;e, to give directions for cau&s;ing papi&s;ts to be removed from the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. A proclamation was publi&s;hed, or|dering the laws to be &s;trictly put in execution again&s;t papi&s;ts. When Harley appeared in the hou&s;e of commons after his recovery, he was congratulated upon it by the &s;peaker in a florid and ful&s;ome premeditated &s;peech. An act was pa&s;&s;ed. decreeing, That an attempt upon the life of a privy-coun&s;ellor &s;hould $e $elony without benefit of the clergy. The earl of Roche&s;ter dying, Harley $span$ was created baron of Wigmore, and rai&s;ed to the rank of $word$ by the noble and antient titles of Oxford and Mortimer: to crown his $word$ hewas appointed lord-trea&s;urer, and ve&s;ted with the &s;upreme ad|mini&s;tration of affairs.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> The commons impowered certain per&s;ons to examine all the grants made by king William, and report the value of them, as well as the con&s;iderations upon which they were made. Upon their report a bill was formed, and pa&s;&s;ed that hou&s;e; but the lords rejected it at the fir&s;t reading. Their next &s;tep was to examine the public accounts, with a view to fix an imputation on the earl of Godolphin. They voted, That above five and thirty millions of the money granted by parliament remained unaccounted for. This &s;um, however, included &s;ome accounts in the reigns of king Charles and king William. One half of the whole was charged to Mr. Bridges the payma&s;ter, who had actually ac|counted for all the money he had received, except about three millions, though the&s;e accounts had not pa&s;&s;ed through the auditor's office. The commons after|wards proceeded to inquire into the debts of the navy, that exceeded five millions, which with many other debts were thrown into one &s;tock, amounting to nine millions four hundred and &s;eventy-one thou&s;and, three hundred and twenty-five pounds. A fund was formed for paying an intere&s;t or annuity of &s;ix per cent. until the principal &s;hould be di&s;charged; and with this was granted a monopoly of a projected trade to the South-&s;ea, ve&s;ted in the proprietors of navy-bills, de|bentures, and other public &s;ecurities, which were incorporated for this purpo&s;e. Such was the origin of the South-&s;ea company, founded upon a chimerical &s;uppo&s;ition, that the Engli&s;h would be permitted to trade upon the coa&s;t of Peru in the We&s;t-Indies. Perhaps, the new mini&s;try hoped to obtain this per|mi&s;&s;ion as an equivalent for their abandoning the intere&s;t of king Charles with re&s;pect to his preten&s;ions upon Spain. By this time the emperor Jo&s;eph had died of the &s;mall-pox without male i&s;&s;ue; &s;o that his brother's immediate aim was to &s;ucceed him on the Imperial throne. This event was on the twentieth day of April communicated by a me&s;&s;age from the queen to both hou&s;es. She told them, that the &s;tates-general had concurred with her in a re&s;olution to &s;up|port the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and, that they had already taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as would &s;ecure the election of Charles as head of the empire.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e of commons, in order to demon&s;trate their attachment to the church, in con&s;equence of an addre&s;s from the lower hou&s;e of convoca|tion, and a quickening me&s;&s;age from the queen, pa&s;&s;ed a bill for building fifty new churches in the &s;uburbs of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and appropriated
<PB N="379" REF="3820">
for this purpo&s;e the duty upon coals, which had been granted for the building of St. Paul's, now fini&s;hed. This impo&s;ition was continued until it &s;hould rai&s;e the &s;um of three hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds. At the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion the commons pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance or repre&s;entation to the queen, in which they told her, that they had not only rai&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, but al&s;o di&s;|charged the heavy debts of which the nation had &s;o long and ju&s;tly complained. They &s;aid, that in tracing the cau&s;es of this debt, they had di&s;covered fraud, embezzlement, and mi&s;application of the public money: that they who of late years had the management of the trea&s;ury, were guilty of notorious breach of tru&s;t and inju&s;tice to the nation, in allowing above thirty millions to remain unaccounted for; a purpo&s;ed omi&s;&s;ion that looked like a de&s;ign to conceal em|bezzlements. They begged her maje&s;ty would give immediate directions for compelling the &s;everal impre&s;t accountants &s;peedily to pa&s;s their accounts. They expre&s;&s;ed their hope, that &s;uch of the accountants as had neglected their duty in pro&s;ecuting their accounts, ought no longer to be intru&s;ted with the public money. They affirmed, that from all the&s;e evil practices and wor&s;e de&s;igns of &s;ome per&s;ons, who had by fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of love to their country, in&s;inuated them&s;elves into her royal favour, irreparable mi&s;chief would have accrued to the public, had not her maje&s;ty, in her great wi&s;dom, &s;ea&s;onably di&s;covered the fatal tendency of &s;uch mea&s;ures, and removed from the admini&s;tration tho&s;e who had &s;o ill an&s;wered her maje&s;ty's favourable opinion, and in &s;o many in&s;tances gro&s;ly abu&s;ed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. They ob&s;erved, that her people could with greater patience have &s;uffered the manifold injuries done to them&s;elves, by the frauds and depredations of &s;uch evil mini&s;ters, had not the &s;ame men proceeded to treat her &s;acred per&s;on with undutifulne&s;s and di&s;regard. This re|pre&s;entation being circulated through the kingdom, produced the de&s;ired effect of inflaming the minds of the people again&s;t the late mini&s;try. Such expedi|ents were become nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of Oxford's project, which was to put a &s;peedy end to a war that had already &s;ubjected the people to grievous op|pre&s;&s;ion, and even accumulated heavy burdens to be tran&s;mitted to their po&s;te|rity. The nation was in&s;pired by extravagant ideas of glory and conque&s;t, even to a rage of war-making; &s;o that the new mini&s;ters, in order to di&s;pel tho&s;e dangerous chimeras, were obliged to take mea&s;ures for exciting their indigna|tion and contempt again&s;t tho&s;e per&s;ons whom they had formerly idolized as their heroes and patriots. On the twelfth day of June the queen having given the royal a&s;&s;ent to &s;everal public and private bills, made an affectionate &s;peech to both hou&s;es. She thanked the commons in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions for having complied with all her de&s;ires; for having baffled the expectations of her ene|mies in finding &s;upplies for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year; in having granted greater &s;ums than were ever given to any prince in one &s;e&s;&s;ion; and in hav|ing &s;ettled funds for the payment of the public debts; &s;o that the credit of the nation was re&s;tored. She expre&s;&s;ed her earne&s;t concern for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Hanover; and her fixed re&s;olution to &s;upport and encourage the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. Then the parliament was pro|rogued.</P>

<P>Of the convocation which was a&s;&s;embled with the new parliament, the lower hou&s;e cho&s;e Dr. Atterbury their prolocutor. He was an enterpri&s;ing ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic of exten&s;ive learning, acute talents, violently attached to Tory prin|ciples,
<PB N="380" REF="3830">
and intimately connected with the prime mini&s;ter Oxford; &s;o that he directed all the proceedings in the lower hou&s;e of convocation in concert with that mini&s;ter. The queen, in a letter to the archbi&s;hop, &s;ignified her hope, that the con&s;ultations of the clergy might be of u&s;e to repre&s;s the attempts of loo&s;e and profane per&s;ons. She &s;ent a licence under the broad &s;eal, impowering them to &s;it and do $u&s;ine&s;s, in as ample a manner as ever had been granted &s;ince the reformation. They were ordered to lay before the queen an account of the exce&s;&s;ive growth of infidelity and here&s;y, as well as of other abu&s;es, that nece&s;|&s;ary mea&s;ures might be taken for a reformation. The bi&s;hops were purpo&s;ely &s;lighted and over$ooked, becau&s;e they had lived in harmony with the late mini&s;|ters. A committee being appointed to draw up a repre&s;entation of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of t$e church and religion, Atterbury undertook the ta&s;k, and compo&s;ed a remon&s;trance that contained the mo&s;t keen and &s;evere &s;trictures upon the ad|mini&s;tration, as it had been exerci&s;ed &s;ince the time of the revolution. An|other was penned by the bi&s;hops in more moderate terms; and &s;everal regula|tions were made, but in none of the&s;e did the two hou&s;es agree. They con|curred, however, in cen&s;uring &s;ome tenets favouring Ariani&s;m, broached and &s;upported by Mr. Whi&s;ton, mathematical profe&s;&s;or in Cambridge. He had been expelled the univer&s;ity, and wrote a vindication of him&s;elf, dedicated to the convocation. The archbi&s;hop doubted whether this a&s;&s;emby could proceed again&s;t a man for here&s;y: the judges were con&s;ulted, and the majority of them gave in their opinion, that the convocation had a juri&s;diction. Four of them profe&s;&s;ed the contrary &s;entiment, which they maintained from the &s;tatutes made at the reformation. The queen, in a letter to the bi&s;hops, &s;aid, that as there was now no doubt of their juri&s;diction, &s;he expected they would proceed in the matter before them. Fre&s;h &s;cruples ari&s;ing, they determined to examine the book, without proceeding aga$n&s;t the author, and this was cen&s;ured accordingly. An extract of the &s;entence was &s;ent to the queen; but &s;he did not &s;ignify her plea&s;ure on this &s;ubject, and the affair remained in &s;u&s;pence. Whi&s;ton pub|li&s;hed a work in four volumes, ju&s;tifying his doctrine, and maintaining, that the apo&s;tolical con&s;titutions were not only canonical, but al&s;o preferable in point of authority to the epi&s;tles and the go&s;pel.</P>

<P>The new mini&s;try had not yet determined to &s;uper&s;ede the duke of Marlborough in the command of the army. This was a &s;tep which could not be taken without giving umbrage to the Dutch and other allies. He therefore &s;et out for Holland in the month of February, after the queen had a&s;&s;ured him, that he might depend upon the punctual payment of the forces. Having con|ferred with the deputies of the &s;tates about the operations of the campaign, he about the middle of April a&s;&s;embled the army at Orchies, between Li&s;le and Do$ay; while marechal de Villars drew together the French troops in the neighbourhood of Cambray and Arras. Lewis had by this time depopulated as well as impoveri&s;hed his kingdom; yet his &s;ubjects &s;till flocked to his &s;tand|ard with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;pirit and attachment. Under the pre&s;&s;ure of extreme mi|&s;ery they uttered not one complaint of their &s;overeign; but imputed all their calamities to the pride and ob&s;tinacy of the allies. Exclu&s;ive of all the other impo&s;itions that were layed upon that people, they con&s;ented to pay the tenth penny of their whole &s;ub&s;tance; but all their efforts of loyalty and af|fection to their prince would have been ineffectual, had not the merchants of
<PB N="381" REF="3840">
the kingdom, by the permi&s;&s;ion of Philip, undertaken repeated voyages to the South-&s;ea, from whence they brought home immen&s;e trea&s;ures: while the allies took no &s;teps for intercepting the&s;e &s;upplies, though nothing could have been more ea&s;y for the Engli&s;h than to deprive the enemy of this great re&s;ource, and convert it to their own advantage. Had a &s;quadron of &s;hips been annually em|ployed for this purpo&s;e, the &s;ubjects of France and Spain mu&s;t have been lite|rally &s;tarved, and Lewis obliged to &s;ubmit to &s;uch terms as the confederates might have thought proper to impo&s;e. Villars had found means to a&s;&s;emble a very numerous army, with which he encamped behind the river San&s;et, in &s;uch an advantageous po&s;t as could not be attacked with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s$ Mean while the duke of Marlborough pa&s;&s;ed the Scarpe, and formed his camp between Do$ay and Bouchain, where he was joined by prince Eugene on the twenty-third day of May. This general, however, did not long remain in the Netherlands. Under&s;tanding that detachments had been made from the army of Villars to the Rhine, and that the elector of Bavaria intended to act in the empire, he, by order from the court of Vienna, marched towards the Upper Rhine with the Imperial and Palatine troops to &s;ecure Germany. The duke of Marlborough repa&s;&s;ing the Scarpe, encamped in the plains of Lens, from whence he advanced towards Aire, as if he had intended to attack the French lines in that quarter. The&s;e lines beginning at Bouchain on the Scheld, were continued along the San&s;et and the Scarpe to Arras, and thence along the Upper Scarpe to Canch&eacute;. They were defended by redoubts and other works, in &s;uch a manner, that Villars judged they were impenetrable, and called them the Ne plus ultra of Marlborough.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>This nobleman advancing within two leagues of the French lines, ordered a great number of $a&s;cines to be made, declaring he would attack them the next morning; &s;o that Villars drew all his forces on that &s;ide, in full ex|pectation of an engagement. The duke, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the pa&s;&s;age of the San&s;et by Arleux would be left unguarded, had ordered the generals Ca|dogan and Hompe&s;ch to a&s;&s;emble twenty battalions and &s;eventeen &s;quadrons, from Douay and the neighbouring garri&s;ons, and march to Arleux, where they &s;hould endeavour to pa&s;s the San&s;et. Brigadier Sutton was detached with the artillery and pontoons to lay bridges over the canal near Goulezen, and over the Scarpe at Vitry, while the duke with the whole confederate army began his march for the &s;ame place about nine in the evening. He proceeded with &s;uch expedition, that by five in the morning he pa&s;&s;ed the river at Vitry. There he received intelligence, that Hompe&s;ch had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;es on the San&s;et and Schelde without oppo&s;ition, the enemy having withdrawn their detachments from that &s;ide, ju&s;t as he had imagined. He him&s;elf with his van|guard of fifty &s;quadrons, ha&s;tened his march towards Arleux, and before eight of the clock arrived at Bac&aacute;-Bacheul, where in two hours he was joined by the heads of the columns into which he had divided his infantry. Villars being certified of his intention, about two in the morning decamped with his whole army, and putting him&s;elf at the head of the king's hou&s;hold troops, marched all night with &s;uch expedition, that about eleven in the forenoon he was in &s;ight of the duke of Marlborough, who had by this time joined count Hompe&s;ch. The French general immediately retreated to the main body of his army, which had advanced to the high-road between Arras and Cambray, while the allies encamped upon the Schelde between O$&s;y and E&s;trun, after a march of ten
<PB N="382" REF="3850">
leagues without halting, &s;carce to be paralleled in hi&s;tory. By this plan, &s;o happily executed, the duke of Marlborough fairly outwitted Villars, and, without the lo&s;s of one man$ entered the lines which he had pronounced im|penetrable. This &s;troke of the Engli&s;h general was extolled as a ma&s;ter-piece of military &s;kill, while Villars was expo&s;ed to the ridicule even of his own of|ficers. The field-deputies of the &s;tates-general propo&s;ed that he &s;hould give battle to the enemy, who pa&s;&s;ed the Schelde at Crevecoeur, in order to cover Bouchain: but the duke would not hazard an engagement, con&s;idering how much the army was fatigued by the long march; and that any misfortune, while they continued within the French lines, might be fatal. His intention was to be&s;iege Bouchain, an enterprize that was deemed impracticable, ina&s;much as the place was &s;ituated in a mora$s$ &s;trongly fortified, and defended by a nu|merous garri&s;on, in the neighbourhood of an army &s;uperior in number to that of the allies. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;advantages, and the di&s;&s;ua&s;ions of his own friends, he re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege; and, in the mean time, di&s;|patched brigadier Sutton to England, with an account of his having pa&s;&s;ed the French lines; which was not all agreeable to his enemies. They had prog|no&s;ticated that nothing would be done during this campaign, and began to in|&s;inuate that the duke could &s;trike no &s;troke of importance without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of prince Eugene. They now endeavoured to le&s;&s;en the glory of his &s;uc|ce&s;s; and even taxed him with having removed his camp from a convenient &s;ituation to a place where the troops were in danger of &s;tarving. Nothing could be more provoking than this &s;candalous malevolence, to a great man who had done &s;o much honour to his country, and was then actually expo&s;ing his life in her &s;ervice.</P>

<P>On the tenth day of Augu&s;t Bouchain was inve&s;ted, and the duke of Marlborough exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t extent of his vigilance and capacity, well knowing the difficulties of the undertaking, and how much his reputation would depend upon his &s;ucce&s;s. Villars had taken every precaution that his &s;kill and experience could &s;ugge&s;t, to baffle the endeavours of the Engli&s;h general. He had reinforced the garri&s;on to the number of &s;ix thou|&s;and cho&s;en men, commanded by officers of known courage and ability. He made &s;ome efforts to rai&s;e the &s;iege; but they were rendered ineffectual by the con&s;ummate prudence and activity of the duke of Marlborough. Then he layed a &s;cheme for &s;urpri&s;ing Doway, which likewi&s;e mi&s;carried. If we con&s;ider that the Engli&s;h general, in the execution of his plan, was obliged to form lines, erect regular forts, rai&s;e batteries, throw bridges over a river, make a cau&s;e|way through a deep mora&s;s, provide for the &s;ecurity of convoys again&s;t a nu|merous army on one &s;ide, and the garri&s;ons of Cond&eacute; and Valenciennes on the other; we mu&s;t allow this was the bolde&s;t enterprize of the whole war; that it required all the fortitude, &s;kill, and re&s;olution, of a great general, and all the valour and intrepidity of the confederate troops, who had &s;carce ever exhibited &s;uch amazing proofs of courage upon any other occa&s;ion, as they now di&s;|played at the &s;iege of Bouchain. In twenty days after the trenches were opened, the garri&s;on was obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war; and this conque&s;t was the la&s;t military exploit performed by the duke of Marlborough: for the breaches of Bouchain were no &s;ooner repaired, than the oppo&s;ite armies began to &s;eparate, and the allied forces were quartered in the frontier towns, that they might be at hand to take the field early in the &s;pring.

They were now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Mae&s;e, almo&s;t as far as the Sambre; of the Schelde from Tournay, and of the Lys as far as it is navigable. They had reduced Spani&s;h Guelderland, Limburg, Brabant, Flanders, and the greater part of Hainault: they were ma&s;ters of the Scarpe; and, by the con|que&s;t of Bouchain, they had opened to them&s;elves a way into the very bowels of France. All the&s;e acqui&s;itions were owing to the valour and conduct of the duke of Marlborough, who now returned to the Hague, and arrived in Eng|land about the middle of November.</P>

<P>The queen had conferred the command of her forces in Spain upon the duke of Argyle, who was recalled from the &s;ervice in Flanders for that purpo&s;e. He had long been at variance with the duke of Marlborough; a circum&s;tance which recommended him the more &s;trongly to the mini&s;try. He landed at Barcelona on the twenty-ninth of May, and found the Briti&s;h troops in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The trea&s;urer had pro|mi&s;ed to &s;upply him liberally; the commons had granted one million, five hun|dred thou&s;and pounds for that &s;ervice. All their hopes of &s;ucce&s;s were fixed on the campaign in that kingdom; and indeed the army commanded by the duke of Vendome was in &s;uch a wretched condition, that if Staremberg had been properly &s;upported by the allies, he might have obtained &s;ignal advantages. The duke of Argyle having waited in vain for the promi&s;ed remittances, was obliged to borrow money on his own credit, before the Briti&s;h troops could take the field. At length Staremberg advanced towards the enemy, who attacked him at the pa&s;s of Prato del Rey, where they were repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable da|mage. After this action the duke of Argyle was &s;eized with a violent fever, and conveyed back to Barcelona. Vendome inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Cardona, which was vigorou&s;ly defended till the end of December, when a detachment being &s;ent to the relief of the place, defeated the be&s;iegers, killed two thou|&s;and on the &s;pot, and took all their artillery, ammunition, and baggage. Staremberg was unable to follow the blow: the duke of Argyle wrote pre&s;&s;ing letters to the mini&s;try, and loudly complained that he was altogether un&s;up|ported; but all his remon&s;trances were ineffectual: no remittances arrived$ and he returned to England without having been able to attempt any thing of importance. In September, king Charles leaving his queen at Barcelona, &s;et $ail for Italy, and at Milan had an interview with the duke of Savoy, where all di&s;putes were compromi&s;ed. That prince had forced his way into Savoy, and penetrated as far as the Rhine: but he &s;uddenly halted in the middle of his career, and after a &s;hort campaign repa&s;&s;ed the mountains. Prince Eugene, at the head of the German forces, protected the electors at Frankfort from the de&s;igns of the enemy, and Charles was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en emperor; the electors of Cologne and Bavaria having been excluded from voting, becau&s;e they lay under the ban of the empire. The war between the Ottoman Porte and the Mu&s;covites was of &s;hort duration. The czar advanced &s;o far into Moldavia, that he was cut off from all &s;upplies, and altogether in the power of his enemy. In this emergency, he found means to corrupt the grand vizir in private, while in public he propo&s;ed articles of peace that were accepted. The king of Sweden, who was in the Turki&s;h army, charged the vizir with treachery, and that mini&s;ter was actually di&s;graced. The grand &s;ignor threat|ened to renew the war; but he was appea&s;ed by the czar's &s;urrendering A$oph.</P>

<P>The Engli&s;h mini&s;try had conceived great expectations from an expedition again&s;t Quebec and Placentia, in North America, planned by colonel Nichol&s;on, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nova Scotia, and garri&s;oned Port-royal, to which he gave the name of Annapolis. He had brought four Indian chiefs to England, and repre&s;ented the advantages that would redound to the nation, in point of commerce, &s;hould the French be expelled from North America. The mini&s;ters reli&s;hed the propo&s;al. A body of five thou&s;and men were embarked in tran&s;ports, under the command of brigadier Hill, brother to Mrs. Ma&s;ham; and they &s;ailed from Plymouth in the beginning of May, with a &s;trong &s;qua|dron of &s;hips commanded by Sir Hovenden Walker. At Bo&s;ton in New Eng|land, they were joined by two regiments of provincials; and about four thou|&s;and men, con&s;i&s;ting of American planters, Palatines, and Indians, rendez|vou&s;ed at Albany, in order to march by land into Canada, while the fleet &s;ailed up the river of that name. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, they were expo&s;ed to a violent &s;torm, and driven among rocks, where eight tran&s;|ports peri&s;hed with about eight hundred men. The admiral immediately &s;ailed back to Spani&s;h-River bay, where it was determined in a council of war, that as the fleet and forces were victualled for ten weeks only, and they could not depend upon a &s;upply of provi&s;ions from New-England, they &s;hould return home, without making any further attempt. Such was the i&s;&s;ue of this paultry expedition, intru&s;ted to the direction of an officer without talents and ex|perience.</P>

<P>In the Iri&s;h parliament held during the &s;ummer, the duke of Or|mond and the majority of the peers &s;upported the Tory-intere&s;t, while the commons expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t attachment to revolution-principles. The two hou&s;es made &s;trenuous repre&s;entations, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;evere re&s;olutions again&s;t each other. After the &s;e&s;&s;ion, Sir Con&s;tantine Phipps the chancellor, and ge|neral Ingold$by, were appointed ju&s;tices in the ab&s;ence of the duke of Ormond, who returned to England in the month of November. In Scotland the Ja|cobites made no &s;cruple of profe&s;&s;ing their principles and attachments to the pretender. The dutche&s;s of Gordon pre&s;ented the faculty of advocates with a &s;ilver medal repre&s;enting the chevalier de St. George; and on the rever&s;e the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, with the motto "Redditte." After &s;ome debate, it was voted, by a majority of &s;ixty-three voices again&s;t twelve, that the dutche&s;s &s;hould be thanked for this token of her regard. This ta&s;k was performed by Dunda&s;s of Arni&s;toun, who thanked her grace for having pre&s;ented them with a medal of their &s;overeign lord the king; hoping, and being confident, that her grace would very &s;oon have an opportunity to compliment the faculty with a &s;econd medal, &s;truck upon the re&s;toration of the king and royal family, and the fini&s;hing rebellion, u&s;urping tyranny and whiggery. An account of this tran&s;action being layed before the queen, the lord-advocate was ordered to inquire into the particulars. Then the faculty were &s;o intimidated, that they di&s;owned Dunda&s;s, and Horne his accomplice. They pretended that the affair of the medal had been tran&s;acted by a party at an occa&s;ional meet|ing, and not by general con&s;ent; and, by a &s;olemn act, they declared their at|tachment to the queen and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The court was &s;atisfied with this atonement; but the re&s;ident from Hanover having pre&s;ented a memo|rial to the queen, de&s;iring that Dunda&s;s and his a&s;&s;ociates might be pro&s;ecuted,

the government removed Sir David Dalrymple from his office of lord-advo|cate, on pretence of his having been too remi&s;s in pro&s;ecuting tho&s;e delin|quents; and no further inquiry was made into the affair.</P>

<P>For &s;ome time a negotiation for peace had been carried on be|tween the court of France and the new mini&s;ters, who had a double aim in this mea&s;ure; namely, to mortify the Whigs and the Dutch, whom they de|te&s;ted, and to free their country from a ruinous war, which had all the ap|pearance of becoming habitual to the con&s;titution. They fore&s;aw the ri&s;que they would run by entering into &s;uch mea&s;ures, &s;hould ever the oppo&s;ite faction regain the a&s;cendency: they knew the Whigs would employ all their art and influence, which was very powerful, in ob&s;tructing the peace, and in rai&s;ing a popular clamour again&s;t the treaty. But their motives for treating were &s;uch as prompted them to undervalue all tho&s;e difficulties and dangers. They hoped to obtain &s;uch advantages in point of commerce, for the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, as would &s;ilence all detraction. They did not doubt of being able to maintain the &s;uperiority which they had acquired in parliament; and perhaps &s;ome of them cheri&s;hed views in favour of the pretender, who&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the crown would have effectually e&s;tabli&s;hed their dominion over the oppo&s;ite party. The earl of Jer&s;ey, who acted in concert with Oxford, &s;ent a private me&s;&s;age to the court of France, importing the queen's earne&s;t de&s;ire of peace, repre&s;enting the impo&s;&s;ibility of a private negotiation, as the mini&s;try was obliged to act with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection; and de&s;iring that Lewis would propo&s;e to the Dutch a renewal of the conferences, in which ca&s;e the Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries &s;hould have &s;uch in&s;tructions, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;tates-general to prevent the conclu&s;ion of the treaty. This intimation was delivered by one Gualtier, an ob&s;cure prie&s;t, who acted as chaplain to count Gallas the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador, and had been employed as a &s;py by the French mini&s;try, &s;ince the commencement of ho&s;tilities. His connexion with lord Jer&s;ey was by means of his lady, who profe&s;&s;ed the roman catholic re|ligion. His me&s;&s;age was extremely agreeable to the court of St. Germain's; and he returned to London with a letter of compliment from the marquis de Torcy to the earl of Jer&s;ey, in which that mini&s;ter a&s;&s;ured him of his ma&s;ter's &s;incere inclination for peace, though he was aver&s;e to a renewal of the con|ferences with the &s;tates-general. Gualtier wrote a letter to Ver&s;ailles, de&s;iring, in the name of the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, that his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty would communicate to them his propo&s;als for a general peace, which they would com|municate to the &s;tates-general, that they might negotiate in concert with their allies. A general an&s;wer being made to this intimation, Gualtier made a &s;econd journey to Ver&s;ailles, and brought over a memorial, which was immediately tran&s;mitted to Holland. In the mean time, the pen&s;ionary endeavoured to re|new the conferences in Holland. Petkum wrote to the French mini&s;try, that if his maje&s;ty would re&s;ume the negotiation, in concert with the queen of Great Britain, he &s;hould certainly have rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the con|duct of the Dutch deputies. This propo&s;al Lewis declined, at the de&s;ire of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters.</P>

<P>The &s;tates-general having peru&s;ed the memorial, a&s;&s;ured queen Anne that they were ready to join with her in contributing to the conclu&s;ion of a durable peace; but they expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that the French king would
<PB N="386" REF="3890">
communicate a more particular plan for &s;ecuring the intere&s;t of the allied $word$ and for &s;etting the repo&s;e of Europe. Gualtier was once more &s;ent to $word$ $word$ by Mr. Prior, who had re&s;ided in France as &s;ecretary to the emba&s;&s;ies of the earls of Portland and Jer&s;ey. He had acquired &s;ome repu|tation by his poetical $word$ was a man of uncommon ability, in&s;inuating $span$ to the $ory-intere&s;t. He was empowered to $span$ of the Engli&s;h; to receive the an&s;wer of $span$ or not king Philip had tran&s;mitted a $span$ He arrived incognito at Fountainebleau, $span$ in which &s;he demanded a barrier for the $span$ on the Rhin$ for the empire; a $span$ and a general &s;ati$faction to all her allies. She $span$ savoy &s;hould be $word$ and that he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;&s; &s;uch towns and di&s;tricts in Italy as had been $word$ to him in treaties between him and his allies: that Lews &s;hould acknow|ledge queen Anne and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; $word$ the fortifications of $word$ and agree to a new treaty of commence: that G$bralt$r and $word$ &s;hould be yielded to the crown of England: that the negro trade in America, at that time carried on by the $rench &s;hould be ceded to the Eng|lish, together with &s;ome towns on that continent, where the &s;laves might be refre&s;hed. She expected &s;ecurity that her &s;ubjects trading to Spain &s;hould en|joy all advantages granted by that crown to to the mo&s;t favoured nation: that &s;he &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;$e&s;&s;ion of Newfoundland and Hud&s;on's bay, either by way of $word$ or $e&s;&s;ion; and that both nations &s;hould continue to enjoy what|ever territories they might be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in North America at the ratification of the treaties. She likewi&s;e in&s;i&s;ted upon a &s;ecurity that the crowns of France and Spain &s;hould never be united on the &s;ame head. Her maje&s;ty no longer in&s;i&s;ted upon Philip's being expelled from the throne of Spain by the arms of his own grandfather. She now perceived that the exorbitant power of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria would be as dangerous to the liberty of Europe, as ever that of the family of Bourbon had been in the zenith of its glory. She might have remembered the exce&s;&s;ive power, the in&s;olence, the ambition, of Charles V. and Philip II. who had en&s;laved &s;o many countries, and embroiled all Europe. She was &s;incerely de&s;irous of peace, from motives of humanity and compa&s;&s;ion to her &s;ubjects and fellow-creatures: &s;he was eagerly bent upon procuring &s;uch advantages to her people, as would enable them to di&s;charge the heavy load of debt under which they laboured, and recompence them in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the blood and trea&s;ure they had &s;o lavi&s;hly expended in the pro&s;ecution of the war. The&s;e were the &s;entiments of a chri&s;tian prince&s;s; of an amiable and pious &s;overeign$ who bore a &s;hare in the grievances of her &s;ubjects, and looked upon them with the eyes of maternal affection. She thought &s;he had the bet|ter title to in&s;i&s;t upon tho&s;e advantages, as they had been already granted to her &s;ubjects in a private treaty with king Charles.</P>

<P>As Prior's powers were limited in &s;uch a manner that he could not negotiate$ Menager, deputy from the city of Rouen to the board of trade, accompanied the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter to London, with full powers to &s;ettle the preliminaries of the treaty. At his arrival in London, the queen immediately commi&s;&s;ioned the duke of Shrew&s;bury, the earls of Jer&s;ey, Dartmouth, Ox|ford,
<PB N="387" REF="3900">
and Mr. St. John, to treat with him; and the conferences were imme|diately begun. After long and various di&s;putes, they agreed upon certain pre|liminary articles, which, on the eighth day of October, were &s;igned by the French mini&s;ter, and by the two &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, in con&s;equence of a written order from her maje&s;ty. Then Menager was privately introduced to the queen at Wind&s;or. She told him &s;he was aver&s;e to war: that &s;he would exert all her power to conclude a &s;peedy peace: that &s;he &s;hould be glad to live upon good terms with the king of France, to whom &s;he was &s;o nearly allied in blood; and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her hope that there would be a clo&s;er union after the peace, between them, and between their &s;ubjects, cemented by a perfect corre&s;pondence and friend&s;hip. The earl of Strafford, who had been lately recalled from the Hague, where he re&s;ided as amba&s;&s;ador, was now &s;ent back to Holland, with orders to communicate to the pen&s;ionary the propo&s;als of peace which France had made; to &s;ignify the queen's approbation of them, and propo&s;e a place where the plenipotentiaries &s;hould a&s;&s;emble. The Engli&s;h mini&s;ters now en|gaged in an intimate corre&s;pondence with the court of Ver&s;ailles; and marechal Tallard being relea&s;ed from his confinement at Nottingham, was allowed to return to his own country on his parole. After the departure of Menager, the preliminaries were communicated to count Gallas, the emperor's mini&s;ter, who, in order to inflame the minds of the people, cau&s;ed them to be tran|&s;lated and in&s;erted in one of the daily papers. This &s;tep was &s;o much re&s;ented by the queen, that &s;he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring he would come no more to court; but that he might leave the kingdom as &s;oon as he &s;hould think proper. He took the hint, and retired accordingly; but the queen gave the emperor to un|der&s;tand, that any other mini&s;ter he &s;hould appoint, would be admitted by her without he&s;itation.</P>

<P>The &s;tates of Holland, alarmed at the preliminaries, &s;ent over Buys as envoy extraordinary, to intercede with the queen that &s;he would alter her re&s;olutions: but &s;he continued &s;teady to her purpo&s;e; and the earl of Straf|ford demanded the immediate concurrence of the &s;tates, declaring, in the queen's name, that &s;he would look upon any delay, on their part, as a refu&s;al to comply with her propo&s;itions. Intimidated by this declaration, they agreed to open the general conferences at Utrecht on the fir&s;t day of January. They granted pa&s;&s;ports to the French mini&s;ters; and the queen appointed Robin&s;on bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, and the earl of Strafford, her plenipotentiaries at the congre&s;s. Charles, the new emperor, being at Milan when he received a copy of the pre|liminaries, wrote circular letters to the electors and princes of the empire, ex|horting them to per&s;i&s;t in their engagements to the grand alliance. He like|wi&s;e de&s;ired the &s;tates-general to join coun&s;els with him in per&s;uading the queen of England to reject the propo&s;als of France, and pro&s;ecute the war; or at lea&s;t negotiate on the foundation of the fir&s;t preliminaries, which had been &s;igned by the marquis de Torcy. He wrote a letter to the &s;ame purpo&s;e to the queen of Great Britain, who received it with the mo&s;t mortifying indif|ference. No wonder that he &s;hould zealou&s;ly contend for the continuance of a war, the expence of which &s;he and the Dutch had hitherto almo&s;t wholly de|frayed. The new preliminaries were &s;everely attacked by the Whigs, who ri|diculed and reviled the mini&s;try in word and writing. Pamphlets, libels, and lampoons, were to-day publi&s;hed by one faction, and to-morrow an&s;wered by
<PB N="388" REF="3910">
the other. They contained all the in&s;inuations of malice and contempt, all the b$tterne$$ of reproach, and all the rancour of recrimination. In the mid&s;t of $word$ contention, the queen di&s;patched the earl of Rivers to Hanover, with $n a&s;&s;urance to the elector, that his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown &s;hould be effectually $$certained in the treaty. The earl brought back an an&s;wer in writing: but, a$ the &s;ame time, his electoral highne&s;s ordered the baron de Bothmar, his en|voy an England, to pre&s;ent a memorial to the queen, repre&s;enting the perni|$$ous con&s;equences of Philip's remaining in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Spain and the We&s;t Indies. This remon&s;trance the baron publi&s;hed by way of appeal to the people, and the Whigs extolled it with the highe&s;t encomiums, while the queen and her mini&s;ters re&s;ented this &s;tep, as an officious and inflammatory inter|po&s;ition.</P>

<P>The propo&s;als of peace made by the French king were di&s;|agreeable even to &s;ome individuals of the Tory-party, and certain peers who had hitherto adhered to that intere&s;t, agreed with the Whigs, to make a re|mon&s;trance again&s;t the preliminary articles. The court being appri&s;ed of their intention, prorogued the parliament till the &s;eventh day of December, in ex|pectation of the Scotti&s;h peers, who would ca&s;t the balance in favour of the mi|ni&s;try. In her &s;peech, at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;he told them that, not|with&s;tanding the arts of tho&s;e who delighted in war, the place and time were appointed for a congre&s;s; and that the &s;tates-general had expre&s;&s;ed their entire confidence in her conduct. She declared her chief concern &s;hould be to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the hou&s;e of Hanover; to procure all the advan|tages to the nation which a tender and affectionate &s;overeign could procure for a dutiful and loyal people; and to obtain &s;atisfaction for all her allies. She ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t effectual way to procure an advantageous peace, would be to make preparations for carrying on the war with vigour. She recom|mended unanimity, and prayed God would direct their con&s;ultations. In the hou&s;e of lords, the earl of Nottingham, who had now a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with the Whigs, inveighed again&s;t the preliminaries as captious and in&s;ufficient, and offered a clau&s;e to be in&s;erted in the addre&s;s of thanks, repre&s;enting to her ma|je&s;ty, that in the opinion of the hou&s;e, no peace could be &s;afe or honourable to Great Britain or Europe, if Spain and the We&s;t Indies &s;hould be allotted to any branch of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. A violent debate en&s;ued, in the cour&s;e of which the earl of Angle&s;ey re$$e&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of ea&s;ing the nation of the burdens incurred by an expen&s;ive war. He affirmed, that a good peace might have been procured immediately after the battle of Ramillies, if it had not been prevented by &s;ome per&s;ons who prolonged the war for their own pri|vate intere&s;t. This in&s;inuation was levelled at the duke of Marlborough, who made a long &s;peech in his own vindication. He bowed to the place where the queen &s;at incognito; and appealed to her, whether, while he had the honour to &s;erve her maje&s;ty as general and plenipotentiary, he had not con&s;tantly informed her and her council of all the propo&s;als of peace which had been made; and had not de&s;ired in&s;tructions for his conduct on that &s;ub|ject? He declared, upon his con&s;cience, and in pre&s;ence of the &s;upreme Being, be$ore whom he expected &s;oon to appear, that he was ever de&s;irous of a &s;afe, honourable, and la&s;ting peace; and that he was always very far from enter|taining any de&s;ign of prolonging the war for his own private advantage, as
<PB N="389" REF="3920">
his enemies had mo&s;t fal&s;ely in&s;inuated. At la&s;t the que&s;tion being put, Whether the earl of Nottingham's advice &s;hould be part of the addre&s;s? it was carried in the affirmative by a &s;mall majority. The addre&s;s was accordingly pre&s;ented; and the queen, in her an&s;wer, &s;aid &s;he &s;hould be very &s;orry any one could think &s;he would not do her utmo&s;t to recover Spain and the We&s;t Indies from the hou&s;e of Bourbon. Again&s;t this advice, however, &s;everal peers prote&s;ted, becau&s;e there was no precedent for in&s;erting a clau&s;e of advice in an addre&s;s of thanks; and becau&s;e they looked upon it as an inva&s;ion of the royal prerogative. In the ad|dre&s;s of the commons there was no &s;uch article; and therefore the an&s;wer they received was warm and cordial.</P>

<P>The duke of Hamilton claiming a &s;eat in the hou&s;e of peers, as duke of Brandon, a title he had lately received, was oppo&s;ed by the anti|courtiers, who pretended to fore&s;ee great danger to the con&s;titution from ad|mitting into the hou&s;e a greater number of Scotti&s;h peers than the act of union allowed. Coun&s;el was heard upon the validity of his patent. They ob&s;erved that no objection could be made to the queen's prerogative in conferring ho|nours; and that all the &s;ubjects of the united kingdom were equally capable of receiving honour. The hou&s;e of lords had already decided the matter, in admitting the duke of Queen&s;berry upon his being created duke of Dover. The debate was managed with great ability on both &s;ides: the Scotti&s;h peers united in defence of the duke's claim; and the court exerted its whole &s;trength to &s;upport the patent. Neverthele&s;s, the que&s;tion being put, Whether Scotti&s;h peers, created peers of Great Britain &s;ince the union, had a right to &s;it in that hou&s;e? it was carried in the negative by a majority of five voices; though not without a prote&s;t &s;igned by the lords in the oppo&s;ition. The Scotti&s;h peers were &s;o incen&s;ed at this deci&s;ion, that they drew up a repre&s;entation to the queen, complaining of it as an infringement of the union, and a mark of di&s;|grace put upon the whole peerage of Scotland. The bill again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity was revived by the earl of Nottingham, in more moderate terms than tho&s;e that had been formerly rejected; and it pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es by the connivance of the Whigs, upon the earl's promi&s;e that if they would con&s;ent to this mea&s;ure, he would bring over many friends to join them in matters of greater con&s;equence. On the twenty-&s;econd day of December, the queen being indi&s;po&s;ed, granted a commi&s;&s;ion to the lord-keeper, and &s;ome other peers, to give the royal a&s;&s;ent to this bill, and another for the land-tax. The duke of Devon&s;hire obtained leave to bring in a bill for giving precedence of all peers to the electoral prince of Hanover, as duke of Cambridge. An ad|dre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the queen, de&s;iring &s;he would give in&s;tructions to her plenipotentiaries, to con&s;ult with the mini&s;ters of the allies in Holland before the opening of the congre&s;s$ that they might concert the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for proceeding with unanimity, the better to obtain the great ends propo&s;ed by her maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners for examining the public accounts having di&s;covered that the duke of Marlborough had received an annual pre&s;ent of five or &s;ix thou&s;and pounds from the contractors for bread to the army, the queen declared in council, that &s;he thought fit to di&s;mi&s;s him from all his employments, that the matter might be impartially examined. This declaration was im|pa$ted to him in a letter under her own hand, in which &s;he took occa&s;ion to

complain of the treatment &s;he had received.

The mi|n$$try, in order to a$c$rtain a ma$$rity in the hou&s;e of lords, per&s;uaded the queen to take a mea&s;ure which nothing but nece&s;$ty could ju&s;ti&s;y.

<P>At this period prince Eugene arriv$d in E$gland, with a letter to the queen from the emp$$$r, and in&s;tructions to propo$e a new &s;cheme for pro|$$$uting t$$ v$$r. His $rrand was far from being agr$ea$le to the mini&s;try; and they &s;u&s;pected that his real aim was to manage intrigues among the di&s;|contented party, who oppo&s;ed the peace. Neverthele&s;s, he was treated with that re&s;pect which was due to his quality and eminent talents. The mini&s;ters, the nobility, and officers of ci&s;tinction, vi&s;ited him at his arrival. He was admitted to an audience of the queen, who received him with great compla|cency. Having peru&s;ed the letter which he delivered, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her con|cern that her health did not permit her to &s;peak with his highne&s;s as often as &s;he could wi&s;h; but that &s;he had ordered the trea&s;urer and &s;ecretary St. John to receive his propo&s;als, and confer with him as frequently as he &s;hould think proper. He expre&s;&s;ed extraordinary re&s;pect for the duke of Marlborough, not|with&s;tanding his di&s;grace. The lord-trea&s;urer, while he entertained him at dinner, declared, that he looked upon that day as the happie&s;t in the whole cour&s;e of his life, &s;ince he had the honour to &s;ee in his hou&s;e the greate&s;t captain of the age. The prince is &s;aid to have replied, <Q>&startq;If I am, it is owing to your lord&s;$ip.&endq;</Q> Alluding to the di&s;grace of Marlborough, whom the earl's in|trigues had deprived of all military command. When bi&s;hop Burnet con|ver&s;ed with him about the &s;candalous l$bels that were every day publi&s;hed again&s;t the duke, and in particular mentioned one paragraph, in which the author al|lowed
<PB N="391" REF="3940">
he had been once fortunate, the prince ob&s;erved it was the greate&s;t com|mendation that could be be&s;towed upon him, as it implied that all his other &s;ucce&s;&s;es were owing to his courage and conduct. While the nobility of both parties vied with each other in demon&s;trations of re&s;pect for this noble &s;tran|ger; while he was adored by the Whigs, and admired by the people, who gazed at him in crowds when he appeared in public; even in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e care&s;&s;es, party-$$ots were excited to in&s;ult his per&s;on, and &s;ome &s;candalous re&s;lections upon his mother were in&s;erted in one of the public papers. The queen treated him with di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of regard; and, on her birth-day, pre&s;ented him with a &s;word worth five thou&s;and pounds. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he looked upon him as a patron and friend of that turbulent faction to which &s;he owed &s;o much di&s;quiet. She knew he had been pre&s;&s;ed to come over by the Whig-noblemen, who hoped his pre&s;ence would inflame the people to &s;ome d$&s;p$rate attempt upon the new mini&s;try: &s;he was not ignorant that he held private conferences with the duke of Marlborough, the earl of Sunderland, the lords Somers, Hallifax, and all the chiefs of that party, and entered into a clo&s;e connection with the baron de Bothmar the Hanoverian envoy, who had been very active in fome$ting the di&s;turbances of the people.</P>

<P>Her maje&s;ty, who had been for &s;ome time a$$licted with the gout, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to both hou&s;es, on the &s;eventeenth day of January, &s;ignifying that the plenipotentiaries were arrived at Utrecht; and that &s;he was employed in making preparations for an early campaign: &s;he hoped therefore that the commons would proceed in giving the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;patch to the &s;upplies. The lord trea&s;urer, in order to demon&s;trate his attachment to the prote&s;tant &s;uc|c$&s;&s;ion, brought in a bill which had been propo&s;ed by the duke of Devon|&s;$ire, giving precedence to the whole electoral family, as children and nephews of the crown; and, when it was pa&s;&s;ed into an act, he &s;ent it over to Hanover by Mr. Thomas Harley. The &s;ixteen peers for Scotland were prevailed upon, by promi&s;e of &s;atisfaction, to re&s;ume their &s;eats in the upper|$ou&s;e, from which they had ab&s;ented them&s;elves &s;ince the deci&s;ion again&s;t the pat$nt of the duke of Hamilton; but whatever pecuniary recompence they might have obtained from the court, on which they were meanly dependent, th$y received no &s;atisfaction from the parliament. The commons finding Mr. Walpole very troubl$&s;ome in their hou&s;e, by his talents, activity, and zealous attachment to the Whig intere&s;t, found means to di&s;cover &s;ome clande&s;tine practices in which he was concerned as &s;ecretary at war, with regard to the forage-contract in Scotland. The contractors, rather than admit into their part$$r&s;hip a per&s;on whom he had recommended for that purpo&s;e, cho&s;e to $word$ his f$$end with five hundred pounds. Their bill was addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. $word$ who i$do$$$d it, and his friend touched the money. This $word$ $word$ interpre$$d into a bribe. Mr. Walpole was voted guilty of $word$ i$pr$$oned in the Tow$r, and expelled the hou&s;e.

<P>$word$ n$xt attack was upon the duke of Marlborough, who was $word$ to have r$ceiv$d a yearly &s;um from Sir Solomon Medina, a Jew, $word$ in the co$tract for furni&s;hing the army with bread; to have been gra|tified
<PB N="392" REF="3950">
by the queen with ten thou&s;and pounds a year to defray the expence of intelligence; and to have pocketted a deduction of two and a half per cent$ from the pay of the foreign troops maintained by England. It was alledged, in his ju&s;tification, that the pre&s;ent from the Jews was a cu&s;tomary perqui&s;ite, which had always been enjoyed by the general of the Dutch army: that the deduction of two and a half per cent$ was granted to him by an expre&s;s warrant from her maje&s;ty: that all the articles of the charge joined together did not ex|ceed thirty thou&s;and pounds, a &s;um much inferior to that which had been al|lowed to king William for contingencies: that the money was expended in procuring intelligence, which was &s;o exact that the duke was never &s;urpri&s;ed: that none of his parties were ever intercepted or cut off; and all his de&s;igns were by the&s;e means &s;o well concerted, that he never once mi&s;carried. Not|with&s;tanding the&s;e repre&s;entations, the majority voted that his practices had been unwarrantable and illegal; and that the deduction was to be accounted for as public money. The&s;e re&s;olutions were communicated to the queen, who ordered the attorney-general to pro&s;ecute the duke for the money he had de|ducted, by virtue of her own warrant. Such practices were certainly mean and mercenary, and greatly tarni&s;hed the glory which the duke had acquired by his military talents, and other &s;hining qualities.</P>

<P>The commons now directed the &s;tream of their re&s;entment again&s;t the Dutch, who had certainly exerted all their endeavours to overwhelm the new mini&s;try, and retard the negotiations for peace. They maintained an inti|mate corre&s;pondence with the Whigs of England. They diffu&s;ed the mo&s;t in|vidious reports again&s;t Oxford and &s;ecretary St. John. Buys their envoy at London, acted the part of an incendiary, in &s;ugge&s;ting violent mea&s;ures to the malcontents, and caballing again&s;t the government. The mini&s;ters, by way of reprizal, influenced the hou&s;e of commons to pa&s;s &s;ome acrimonious re&s;olutions again&s;t the &s;tates-general. They alledged that the &s;tates had been deficient in their proportion of troops, both in Spain and in the Netherlands, during the whole cour&s;e of the war; and that the queen had payed above three millions of crowns in &s;ub&s;idies, above what &s;he was obliged to advance by her engagements. They attacked the barrier treaty, which had been concluded with the &s;tates by lord Town&s;hend, after the conferences at Gertruydenberg. By this agreement, England guaranteed a barrier in the Netherlands to the Dutch; and the &s;tates bound them&s;elves to maintain, with their whole force, the queen's title and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The Tories affirmed that Eng|land was di&s;graced, by engaging any other &s;tate to defend a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which the nation might &s;ee cau&s;e to alter: that, by this treaty, the &s;tates were autho|ri&s;ed to interpo&s;e in Briti&s;h councils: that being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all tho&s;e &s;trong towns, they might exclude the Engli&s;h from trading to them, and interfere with the manufactures of Great Britain. The hou&s;e of commons voted, That in the barrier treaty there were &s;everal articles de&s;tructive to the trade and in|tere&s;t of Great Britain; and therefore highly di&s;honourable to her maje&s;ty: That the lord vi&s;count Town&s;hend was not authorized to conclude &s;everal ar|ticles in that treaty: and, That he and all tho&s;e who advi&s;ed its being ratified, were enemies to the queen and kingdom. All their votes were dige&s;ted into a long repre&s;entation pre&s;ented to the queen, in which they averred that England, during the war, had been overcharged nineteen millions; a circum&s;tance that
<PB N="393" REF="3960">
implied mi&s;management or fraud in the old mini&s;try. The &s;tates, alarmed at the&s;e re&s;olutions, wrote a re&s;pectful letter to the queen, repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of a barrier, for the mutual &s;ecurity of England and the United Provinces. They afterwards drew up a large memorial in vindication of their proceedings during the war, and it was publi&s;hed in one of the Engli&s;h papers. The com|mons immediately voted it a fal&s;e, &s;candalous, and malicious libel, reflecting upon the re&s;olutions of the hou&s;e; and the printer and publi&s;her were taken into cu&s;tody, as guilty of a breach of privilege.</P>

The hou&s;e, notwith&s;tanding this remon&s;trance, proceeded with the bill, and in|&s;erted a clau&s;e prohibiting civil magi&s;trates from executing the &s;entences of the kirk-judicatories. The epi&s;copal, as well as the pre&s;byterian clergy, were required to take the oath of abjuration, that they might be upon an equal foot|ing in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience; for the commons well knew that this condition would be rejected by both, from very different motives. In order to exa&s;perate the pre&s;byterians with further provocations, another act was pa&s;&s;ed for di&s;|continuing the courts of judicature during the Chri&s;tmas holidays, which had never been kept by per&s;ons of that per&s;ua&s;ion. When this bill was read for the third time, Sir David Dalrymple &s;aid, <Q>&startq;Since the hou&s;e is re&s;olved to make no alteration in the body of this bill, I acquie&s;ce; and only de&s;ire it may be intituled, A bill for e&s;tabli&s;hing jacobiti&s;m and immorality.&endq;</Q> The chagrin of the Scotti&s;h pre&s;byterians was completed by a third bill, re|&s;toring the right of patronage, which had been taken away when the di&s;cipline of the kirk was la&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed. Prince Eugene having pre&s;ented a memorial to the queen, touching the conduct of the emperor during the war, and con|taining a propo&s;al with relation to the affairs of Spain, the queen communi|cated the &s;cheme to the hou&s;e of commons, who treated it with the mo&s;t con|temptuous neglect. The prince finding all his efforts ineffectual, retired to the continent, as much di&s;plea&s;ed with the mini&s;try, as he had rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the people of England.

The chief of the Dutch deputies named for the congre&s;s, were Buys and Vanderdu&s;&s;en; and the French king granted his powers to the marechal D'Uxelles, the abbot (afterwards cardinal) de Polignac, and Menager, who had been in England. The mini&s;ters of the emperor and Savoy likewi&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the conferences, to which the empire and the other allies likewi&s;e &s;ent their plenipotentiaries, though not without reluc|tance. As all tho&s;e powers, except France, entertained &s;entiments very differ|ent from tho&s;e of her Britannic maje&s;ty, the conferences &s;eemed calculated ra|ther to retard than accelerate a pacification. The queen of England had fore|&s;een and provided again&s;t the&s;e difficulties. Her great end was to free her &s;ub|jects from the mi&s;eries attending an unprofitable war, and to re&s;tore peace to Europe; and this aim &s;he was re&s;olved to accompli&s;h, in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition. She had al&s;o determined to procure rea&s;onable terms of accommodation for her allies, without, however, continuing to lavi&s;h the blood and trea&s;ure of her people in &s;upporting their extravagant demands. The emperor ob&s;tinately in&s;i&s;ted upon his claim to the whole Sp$ni&s;h monarchy, refu&s;ing to give up the lea&s;t tittle of his preten&s;ions; and the Dutch adhered to the old prelimina|ries which Lewis had formerly rejected. The queen &s;aw, that the liberties of Europe would be expo&s;ed to much greater danger from an actual union of the Imperial and Spani&s;h crowns in one head of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, than from a bare po&s;&s;ibility of Spain's being united with France in one branch of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. She knew by experience the difficulty of dethroning Philip, rooted as he was in the affections of a brave and loyal people; and, that a pro&s;e|cution of this de&s;ign would &s;erve no purpo&s;e but to protract the war, and aug|ment the grievances of the Briti&s;h nation. She was well acquainted with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the French, which &s;he con&s;idered as pledges of their monarch's &s;in|cerity. She &s;ought not the total ruin of that people, already reduced to the brink of de&s;pair. The dictates of true policy di&s;&s;uaded her from contribut|ing to further conque&s;ts in that kingdom, which would have proved the &s;ource of contention among the allies, depre&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of Bourbon below that &s;tand|ard of importance which the ballance of Europe required it &s;hould maintain, and aggrandize the &s;tates-general at the expence of Great-Britain. As &s;he had borne the chief burden of the war, &s;he had a right to take the lead; and dic|tate a plan of pacification: at lea&s;t, &s;he had a right to con&s;ult the welfare of her own kingdom, in delivering, by a &s;eparate peace, her &s;ubjects from tho&s;e enor|mous loads which they could no longer &s;u&s;tain; and &s;he was well enough aware of her own con&s;equence, to think &s;he could obtain advantageous conditions.</P>

<P>Such were the &s;entiments of the queen: and her mini&s;ters &s;eem to have acted on the &s;ame principles, though, perhaps, party-motives may have helped to influence their conduct. The allies concurred in oppo&s;ing with all their might any treaty which could not gratify their different views of avarice, in|tere&s;t, and ambition. They practi&s;ed a thou&s;and little artifices to intimidate the queen, to excite a jealou&s;y of Lewis, to blacken the characters of her mi|ni&s;ters, to rai&s;e and keep up a dangerous ferment among her people, by which her life and government were endangered. She could not fail to re&s;ent the&s;e efforts, which greatly perplexed her mea&s;ures and ob&s;tructed her de&s;ign. Her mini&s;ters were &s;en&s;ible of the dangerous predicament in which they &s;tood. The
<PB N="396" REF="3990">
queen's health was much impaired; and the &s;ucce&s;&s;or countenanced the oppo&s;ite faction. In ca&s;e of their &s;overeign's death they had nothing to expect but pro|&s;ecution and ruin for obeying her commands; and they &s;aw no hope of &s;afety except in renouncing their principles, and &s;ubmitting to their adver&s;aries, or el&s;e in taking &s;uch mea&s;ures as would ha&s;ten the pacification, that the troubles of the kingdom might be appea&s;ed, and the people be &s;atisfied with their conduct before death &s;hould deprive them of their &s;overeign's protection. With this view they advi&s;ed her to &s;et on foot a private negotiation with Lewis; to &s;tipulate cer|tain advantages for her own &s;ubjects in a concerted plan of peace; to enter into &s;uch mutual confidence with that monarch, as would anticipate all clande&s;tine tran&s;actions to her prejudice, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure enable her to pre&s;cribe terms for her allies. The plan was judiciou&s;ly formed, but executed with too much precipitation. The &s;tipulated advantages were not &s;uch as &s;he had a right to demand and in&s;i&s;t upon; and, without all doubt, better might have been ob|tained, had not the ob&s;tinacy of the allies abroad, and the violent conduct of the Whig faction at home, obliged the mini&s;ters to relax in &s;ome material points, and ha&s;ten the conclu&s;ion of the treaty.</P>

<P>The articles being privately regulated between the two courts of Lon|don and Ver&s;ailles, the Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries at Utrecht were furni&s;hed with general powers and in&s;tructions, being ignorant of the agreement which the queen had made with the French monarch touching the kingdom of Spain, which was indeed the ba&s;is of the treaty. This &s;ecret plan of negotiation, how|ever, had well nigh been de&s;troyed by &s;ome unfore&s;een events that were doubly afflicting to Lewis. The dauphin had died of the &s;mall pox in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, and his title had been conferred upon his &s;on the duke of Bur|gundy, who now expired on the la&s;t day of February, &s;ix days after the death of his wife, Mary Adelaide of Savoy. The parents were &s;oon followed to the grave by their elde&s;t offspring the duke of Brittany, in the &s;ixth year of his age; &s;o that of the duke of Burgundy's children, none remained alive but the duke of Anjou, the pre&s;ent French king, who was at that time a &s;ickly infant. Such a &s;eries of calamities could not fail of being extremely &s;hocking to Lewis in his old age; but they were &s;till more alarming to the queen of England, who &s;aw that nothing but the precarious life of an unhealthy child divided the two mo|narchies of France and Spain, the union of which &s;he re&s;olved by all po&s;&s;ible means to prevent. She therefore &s;ent the abb&eacute; Gualtier to Paris, with a me|morial, repre&s;enting the danger to which the liberty of Europe would be ex|po&s;ed &s;hould Philip a&s;cend the throne of France; and demanding, that his title &s;hould be transferred to his brother the duke of Berry, in con&s;equence of his pure, &s;imple, and voluntary renunciation.</P>

<P>Mean while the French plenipotentiares at Utrecht were prevailed upon to deliver their propo&s;als in writing, under the name of &s;pecific offers, which the allies received with indignation. They were treated in England with uni|ver&s;al &s;corn. Lord Hallifax, in the hou&s;e of peers, termed them trifling, arro|gant, and injurious to her maje&s;ty and her allies: an addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the queen, in which they expre&s;&s;ed their re&s;entment again&s;t the in&s;olence of France, and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t her with all their power in pro&s;ecuting the war, until a &s;afe and honourable peace &s;hould be obtained. The plenipotentiaries of the allies were not le&s;s extravagant in their &s;pecific demands, than the French
<PB N="397" REF="4000">
had been arrogant in their offers. In a word, the mini&s;ters &s;eemed to have been a&s;&s;embled at Utrecht, rather to &s;tart new difficulties and widen the breach, than to heal animo&s;ities, and concert a plan of pacification. They amu&s;ed one an|other with fruitle&s;s conferences, while the queen of Great Britain endeavoured to engage the &s;tates-general in her mea&s;ures, that they might treat with France upon moderate terms, and give law to the re&s;t of the allies. She departed from &s;ome of her own preten&s;ions, in order to gratify them with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome towns in Flanders. She con&s;ented to their being admitted into a participation of &s;ome advantages in commerce; and ordered the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters at the con|gre&s;s to tell them, that &s;he would take her mea&s;ures according to the return they &s;hould make on this occa&s;ion. Finding them &s;till ob&s;tinately attached to their fir&s;t chimerical preliminaries, &s;he gave them to under&s;tand, that all her offers for adju&s;ting the differences were founded upon the expre&s;s condition, That they &s;hould come into her mea&s;ures, and co-operate with her openly and &s;in|cerely; but they had made &s;uch bad returns to all her conde&s;cen&s;ion towards them, that &s;he looked upon her&s;elf as relea&s;ed from all engagements. The mi|ni&s;ters of the allies had in&s;i&s;ted upon a written an&s;wer to their &s;pecific demands; and this the French plenipotentiaries declined, until they &s;hould receive fre&s;h in&s;tructions from their ma&s;ter. Such was the pretence for &s;u&s;pending the con|ferences; but the real bar to a final agreement between England and France, was the delay of Philip's renunciation, which, at length, however, arrived; and produced a ce&s;&s;ation of arms.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; V.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean time the duke of Ormond, who was now inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme command of the Briti&s;h forces, received a particular order, that he &s;hould not hazard an engagement. Lewis had already undertaken for the com|pliance of his grand&s;on. Reflecting on his own great age, he was &s;hocked at the pro&s;pect of leaving his kingdom involved in a pernicious war during a mi|nority; and determined to procure a peace at all events. The queen, know|ing his motives, could not help believing his prote&s;tations, and re&s;olved to avoid a battle, the i&s;&s;ue of which might have con&s;iderably altered the &s;ituation of affairs, and con&s;equently retarded the conclu&s;ion of the treaty. Preparations had been made for an early campaign. In the beginning of March the earl of Albemarle having a&s;&s;embled a body of thirty-&s;ix battalions, marched towards Arras, which he reduced to an heap of a&s;hes by a mo&s;t terrible cannonading and bombardment. In May the duke of Ormond conferred with the deputies of the &s;tates-general at the Hague, and a&s;&s;ured them he had orders to act vigo|rou&s;ly in the pro&s;ecution of the war. He joined prince Eugene at Tournay; and on the twenty-&s;ixth day of May the allied army pa&s;&s;ing the Schelde, en|camped at Ha&s;pre and Solemnes. The Imperial general propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould attack the French army under Villars; but by this time the duke was re&s;trained from hazarding &s;iege or battle: a circum&s;tance well known to the French commander, who therefore abated of his u&s;ual vigilance. It could not be long concealed from prince Eugene and the deputies, who forthwith di&s;patched an expre&s;s to their principals on this &s;ubject, and afterwards pre&s;ented a long memorial to the duke, repre&s;enting the injury which the grand alliance would &s;u&s;tain from his obedience to &s;uch an order. He &s;eemed to be extremely unea&s;y at his &s;ituation; and, in a letter to &s;ecretary St. John, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that the queen would permit him to return to England.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; VI.</HEAD>
<P>Prince Eugene, notwith&s;tanding the queen's order, which Ormond had not yet formally declared, inve&s;ted the town of Que&s;noy, and the duke fur|ni&s;hed towards this enterprize &s;even battalions and nine &s;quadrons of the foreign troops maintained by Great-Britain. The Dutch deputies at Utrecht expo&s;tu|lating with the bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol upon the duke's refu&s;ing to act again&s;t the ene|my, that prelate told them, that he had lately received an expre&s;s with a letter from her maje&s;ty, in which &s;he complained, that as the &s;tates-general had not properly an&s;wered her advances, they ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed, if &s;he thought her&s;elf at liberty to enter into &s;eparate mea&s;ures, in order to obtain a peace for her own conveniency. When they remon&s;trated again&s;t &s;uch conduct, as con|tradictory to all the alliances &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the queen and the &s;tates general, the bi&s;hop declared his in&s;tructions further imported, that con&s;idering the conduct of the &s;tates towards her maje&s;ty, &s;he thought her&s;elf di&s;engaged from all alli|ances and engagements with their high-mightine&s;&s;es. The &s;tates and the mi|ni&s;ters of the allies were in&s;tantly in commotion. Private mea&s;ures were con|certed with the elector of Hanover, the landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, and &s;ome other princes of the empire, concerning the troops belonging to tho&s;e powers, in the pay of Great-Britain. The &s;tates-general wrote a long letter to the queen, and ordered their envoy at London to deliver it into her own hand. Count Zinzendorf the emperor's plenipotentiary di&s;patched expre&s;&s;es to his ma&s;ter, to prince Eugene, and to the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador at London. The queen held a council at Ken&s;ington upon the &s;ubject of the letter; and a fre&s;h order was &s;ent to the duke of Ormond, directing him to concur with the general of the allies in a &s;iege.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; VII.</HEAD>
<P>On the twenty-eighth day of May lord Hallifax, in the hou&s;e of peers, de&s;canted upon the ill con&s;equences of the duke's refu&s;ing to co-operate with prince Eugene; and moved for an addre&s;s, de&s;iring her maje&s;ty would order the general to act offen&s;ively, in concert with her allies. The trea&s;urer ob&s;erved it was prudent to avoid a battle on the eve of a peace, e&s;pecially con|&s;idering they had to do with an enemy &s;o apt to break his word. The earl of Wharton replied, this was a &s;trong rea&s;on for keeping no mea&s;ures with &s;$ch an enemy. When Oxford declared, that the duke of Ormond had received orders to join the allies in a &s;iege, the duke of Marlborough affirmed, it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to carry on a &s;iege without either hazarding a battle, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould attempt to relieve the place, or &s;hamefully abandoning the enterprize. The duke of Argyle having declared his opinion, that &s;ince the time of Julius Cae&s;ar there had not been a greater captain than prince Eugence of Savoy, ob|&s;erved, that con&s;idering the different intere&s;ts of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and of Great Britain, it might not con&s;i&s;t with prudence to tru&s;t him with the manage|ment of the war, becau&s;e a battle won or lo&s;t might intirely break off a nego|tiation of peace, which in all probability, was near being concluded. He added, that two years before, the confederates might have taken Arras and Cambray, in&s;tead of amu&s;ing them&s;elves with the in&s;ignificant conque&s;ts of Aire, Bethune, and St. Venant. The duke of Devon&s;hire &s;aid, he was, by proximity of blood more concerned than any other in the reputation of the duke of Ormond; and therefore could not help expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urprize, that any one would dare to make a nobleman of the fir&s;t rank, and of &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a character, the in&s;trument of &s;uch proceedings. Earl Pawlet an&s;wered, that no body could
<PB N="399" REF="4020">
doubt the duke of Ormond's courage; but he was not like a certain general, who led troops to the &s;laughter, to cau&s;e a great number of officers to be knocked on the head, that he might fill his pockets by di&s;po&s;ing of their commi&s;&s;ions. The duke of Marlborough was &s;o deeply affected by this reflection, that tho' he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment in the hou&s;e, he took the fir&s;t opportunity to &s;end lord Mohun to the earl with a me&s;&s;age, importing, that he &s;hould be glad to come to an explanation with his lord&s;hip about &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions he had u&s;ed in that day's debate; and de&s;iring his company to take the air in the country. The earl under&s;tood his meaning; but could not conceal his emotion from the ob&s;ervation of his lady, by who&s;e means the affair was communicated to the earl of Dartmouth &s;ecretary of &s;tate. Two centinels were immediately placed at his lord&s;hip's gate; the queen, by the canal of lord Dartmouth, de&s;ired the duke of Marlborough would proceed no farther in the quarrel: and he a&s;&s;ured her he would punctually obey her maje&s;ty's commands. The earl of Oxford a&s;&s;ured the hou&s;e, that a &s;eparate peace was never intended: that &s;uch a peace would be &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o knavi&s;h, and &s;o villanous, that every one who &s;erved the queen knew they mu&s;t an&s;wer it with their heads to the nation; but that it would appear to be a &s;afe and glorious peace, much more to the honour and intere&s;t of the nation than the fir&s;t preliminaries in&s;i&s;ted upon by the allies. The que&s;tion being put for adjourning, the debate was carried in the affirma|tive; but twenty lords entered a prote&s;t. The earl of Strafford, who had re|turned from Holland, propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould examine the negotiations of the Hague and Gertruydenberg, before they con&s;idered that of Utrecht. He ob&s;erved, that in the former negotiations the French mini&s;ters had conferred only with the pen&s;ionary, who communicated no more of it to the mini&s;ters of the allies than what was judged proper to let them know: &s;o that the Dutch were ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of the &s;ecret. He a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;tates-general had con&s;ented to give Naples and Sicily to king Philip: a circum&s;tance which proved that the recovery of the whole Spani&s;h monarchy was looked upon as impracticable. He concluded with a motion for an addre&s;s to her maje&s;ty, de&s;iring, that the papers relating to the negotiations of the Hague and Ger|truydenberg, &s;hould be layed before the hou&s;e. This was carried without a divi&s;ion.</P>

<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VIII.</HEAD>
<P>In the hou&s;e of commons Mr. Pulteney moved for an addre&s;s, ac|quainting her maje&s;ty, that her faithful commons were ju&s;tly alarmed at the intelli|gence received from abroad, that her general in Flanders had declined acting offen|&s;ively again&s;t France in concurrence with her allies; and be&s;ought her maje&s;ty, that he might receive &s;peedy in&s;tructions to pro&s;ecute the war with the utmo&s;t vigour. This motion was rejected by a great majority. A certain member having in&s;inuated, that the pre&s;ent negotiation had been carried on in a clande&s;tine and treacherous manner, Mr. &s;ecretary St. John &s;aid, he hoped it would not be accounted treachery to act for the good and advantage of Great-Britain: that he gloried in the &s;mall &s;hare he had in the tran&s;action; and whatever cen|&s;ure he might undergo for it, the bare &s;atisfaction of acting in that view, would be a &s;ufficient recompence and comfort to him during the whole cour&s;e of his life. The hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the commons had an intire confidence in her maje&s;ty's promi&s;e, to communicate to her parliament the terms of the peace before it &s;hould be concluded: and, That they would &s;upport her again&s;t all &s;uch per&s;ons either
<PB N="400" REF="4030">
at home or abroad as &s;hould endeavour to ob&s;truct it. The queen thanked them heartily for this re&s;olution, as being dutiful to her, hone&s;t to their country, and very &s;ea&s;onable at a time when &s;o many artifices were u&s;ed to ob&s;truct a good peace, or to force one di&s;advantageous to Britain. They likewi&s;e pre|&s;ented an addre&s;s, de&s;iring, they might have an account of the negotiations and tran&s;actions at the Ha$ue and Gertruydenberg, and know who were then em|ployed as her maje&s;ty's plenipotentiaries.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; IX.</HEAD>
<P>The mini&s;try fore&s;eeing, that Philip would not willingly re&s;ign his hopes of &s;uccee$ing to the crown of France, propo&s;ed an alternative, that, in ca&s;e of his preferring his expectation of the crown of France to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Spain, th$s kingdom, with the Indies, &s;hould be forthwith ceded to the duke of Savoy; and Philip in the mean time &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the duke's he|reditary dominions and the kingdom of Si$ily, together with the Montferrat and Mantua; all which territories &s;hould be annexed to France at Philip's &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to that crown, except Sicily, which &s;hould revert to the hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria. Lewis &s;eemed to reli&s;h this expedient, which, however, was rejected by Philip, who cho&s;e to make the renunciation, rather than quit the throne upon which he was e&s;tabli&s;hed. The queen demanded, that the renunciation &s;hould be ratified in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner by the &s;tates of France; but &s;he after|wards waved this demand, in con&s;ideration of its being regi&s;tered in the diffe|rent parliaments. Such forms are but &s;lender &s;ecurities again&s;t the power, am|bition, and intere&s;t of princes. The marquis de Torcy frankly owned, that Philip's renunciation was in it&s;elf void, as being contrary to the fundamental laws and con&s;titution of the French monarchy; but it was found nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;atisfaction of the Engli&s;h people. Every material arti$le being now ad|ju&s;ted between the two courts, particularly tho&s;e relating to the king of Spain, the commerce of Great Britain, and the delivery of Dunkirk, a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms prevailed in the Netherlands, and the duke of Ormond acted in concert with marechal de Villars.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; X.</HEAD>
<P>On the &s;ixth day of June the queen going to the hou&s;e of peers, com|municated the plan of peace to her parliament, according to the promi&s;e &s;he had made. After having premi&s;ed, that the making peace and war was the un$oubted prerogative of the crown, and hinted at the difficulties which had ari$en both from the nature of the affair, and numberle&s;s ob&s;tructions contrived by the enemies of peace, &s;he proceeded to enumerate the chief articles to which both crowns had agreed, without, however, concluding the treaty. She told them &s;he had &s;ecured the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which France had acknowledged in the &s;tronge&s;t terms; and that the pretender would be removed from the French dominions$ that the duke of Anjou &s;hould renounce for him&s;elf and his de&s;cendants all claim to the crown of France; &s;o that the two monarchies would be for ever divided. She ob&s;erved, that the nature of this propo&s;al was &s;uch as would execute it&s;elf: that it would be the intere&s;t of Spain to &s;upport the renunciation: and in France, the per&s;ons entitled to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of that crown upon the death of the dauphin, were powerful enough to vindicate their own right. She gave them to under&s;tand, that a treaty of commerce between England and France had been begun, though not yet adju&s;ted; but provi&s;ion was made, that England &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame privileges that France granted to the mo&s;t favoured nation: that the French king had agreed to make an ab&s;olute ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="401" REF="4040">
of the i&s;land of St. Chri&s;topher's, which had hitherto been divided between the two nations: that he had al&s;o con&s;ented to re&s;tore the whole bay and &s;traits of Hud&s;on; to deliver the i&s;land of Newfoundland, with Placentia; to cede Anna|polis, with the re&s;t of Acadia or Nova Scotia; to demoli&s;h the fortifications of Dunkirk; to leave England in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gibraltar, Port-Mahon, and the whole i&s;land of Minorca: that the trade to Spain in the We&s;t-Indies might be &s;ettled as it was in the reign of his late catholic maje&s;ty: and, that &s;he had ob|tained for her &s;ubjects the a&s;&s;iento or contract for furni&s;hing the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies with negroes for the term of thirty years, in the &s;ame manner as it had been enjoyed by the French. With re&s;pect to the allies, &s;he declared, that France offered to make the Rhine the barrier of the empire: to yield Bri&s;ac, Fort Kehl, and Landau, and raze all the fortre&s;&s;es both on the other &s;ide of the Rhine and in the i&s;lands of that river: that the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Germany would be re&s;ettled on the footing of the treaty of We&s;tphalia: that the Spani&s;h Netherlands, the kingdoms of Naples and Sardinia, the dutchy of Milan, and the places belonging to Spain on the coa&s;t of Tu&s;cany, might be yielded to his Imperial maje&s;ty; but the di&s;po&s;ition of Sicily was not yet determined: that the demands of the &s;tates-general with relation to commerce and the barrier in the Low Countries, would be granted with a few exceptions, which might be com|pen&s;ated by other expedients: that no great progre&s;s had yet been made upon the preten&s;ions of Portugal; but that tho&s;e of Pru&s;&s;ia would be admitted by France without much difficulty: that the difference between the barrier demanded by the duke of Savoy in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and nine, and that which France now offered, was very incon&s;iderable: that the elector palatine &s;hould maintain his pre&s;ent rank among the electors: and, that France would acknowledge the electoral dignity in the hou&s;e of Hanover. Such were the con|ditions which the queen hoped would make &s;ome amends to her &s;ubjects for the great and unequal burthen they had borne during the whole cour&s;e of the war. She concluded with &s;aying, &s;he made no doubt but they were fully per&s;uaded, that nothing would be neglected on her part in the progre&s;s of this negotiation, to bring the peace to an happy and &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue; and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her depen|dence upon the intire confidence and chearful concurrence of her parlia|ment.</P>

<P>An addre&s;s of thanks and approbation was immediately voted, drawn up, and pre&s;ented to the queen by the commons in a body. When the hou&s;e of lords took the &s;peech into con&s;ideration, the duke of Marlborough a&s;&s;erted, that the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued for a year pa&s;t were directly contrary to her maje&s;ty's en|gagements with the allies: that they &s;ullied the triumphs and glories of her reign; and would render the Engli&s;h name odious to all nations. The earl of Stra$$ord &s;aid, that &s;ome of the allies would not have &s;hewn &s;uch backwardne&s;s to a peace, had not they been per&s;uaded and encouraged to carry on the war by a member of that illu&s;trious a&s;&s;embly, who maintained a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with them, and fed them with hopes that they would be &s;upported by a &s;trong party in England. In an&s;wer to this in&s;inuation again&s;t Marlborough, lord Cowper ob&s;erved, that it could never be &s;ugge&s;ted as a crime in the meane&s;t &s;ubject, much le&s;s in any member of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, to hold corre&s;pon|dence with the allies of the nation; &s;uch allies, e&s;pecially, who&s;e intere&s;t her maje&s;ty had declared to be in&s;eparable from her own, in her &s;peech at the opening
<PB N="402" REF="4050">
of the &s;e&s;&s;ion; whereas it would be a hard matter to ju&s;tify and reconcile either with our laws, or with the laws of honour and ju&s;tice, the conduct of &s;ome per|&s;ons, in treating clande&s;tinely with the common enemy, without the participa|tion of the allies. This was a frivolous argument. A corre&s;pondence with any per&s;ons what&s;oever becomes criminal, when it tends to foment the divi&s;ions of one's country, and arm the people again&s;t their &s;overeign. If England had it not in her power, without infringing the laws of ju&s;tice and honour, to with|draw her&s;elf from a confederacy which &s;he could no longer &s;upport, and treat for peace on her own bottom, then was &s;he not an a&s;&s;ociate, but a &s;lave to the alliance. The earl of Godolphin affirmed, that the trade to Spain was &s;uch a trifle as de|&s;erved no con&s;ideration; and that it would continually dimini&s;h until it &s;hould be intirely engro&s;&s;ed by the French merchants. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e remon|&s;trances again&s;t the plan of peace, the majority agreed to an addre&s;s, in which they thanked the queen for her extraordinary conde&s;cen&s;ion in communicating tho&s;e conditions to her parliament; and expre&s;&s;ed an intire &s;atisfaction with her conduct. A motion was made for a clau&s;e in the addre&s;s, de&s;iring her maje&s;ty would take &s;uch mea&s;ures, in concert with her allies, as might induce them to join with her in a mutual guaranty. A debate en&s;ued: the que&s;tion was put, and the clau&s;e rejected. Several noblemen entered a prote&s;t, which was ex|punged from the books of the hou&s;e by the deci&s;ion of the majority.</P>

<P>In the hou&s;e of commons a complaint was exhibited again&s;t bi&s;hop Fleetwood, who, in a preface to four &s;ermons which he publi&s;hed, took occa&s;ion to extol the la&s;t mini&s;try, at the expence of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. This piece was voted malicious and factious, tending to create di&s;cord and &s;edition among&s;t her maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects; and condemned to be burned by the hands of the common hangman. They pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the queen, a&s;&s;uring her of the ju&s;t &s;en&s;e they had of the indignity offered to her, by printing and pub|li&s;hing a letter from the &s;tates-general to her maje&s;ty; and de&s;iring &s;he would &s;o far re&s;ent &s;uch in&s;ults as to give no an&s;wer for the future to any letters or memo|rials that &s;hould be thus u&s;hered into the world as inflammatory appeals to the public. Mr. Hampden moved for an addre&s;s to her maje&s;ty, that &s;he would give particular in&s;tructions to her plenipotentiaries, that in the conclu&s;ion of the treaty of peace, the &s;everal powers in alliance with her maje&s;ty might be gua|rantees for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hanover. The que&s;tion being put, was carried in the negative. Then the hou&s;e re&s;olved, That they had &s;uch confidence in the repeated declarations her maje&s;ty had made of her concern for a&s;&s;uring to the&s;e kingdoms the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, that they could never doubt her taking the proper mea&s;ures for the &s;ecurity thereof: that the hou&s;e would &s;upport her again&s;t faction at home and her enemies abroad; and did humbly be&s;eech her, that &s;he would be plea&s;ed to di&s;|countenance all tho&s;e who &s;hould endeavour to rai&s;e jealou&s;ies between her ma|je&s;ty and her &s;ubjects, e&s;pecially by mi&s;repre&s;enting her good intentions for the welfare of her people. The queen was extremely plea&s;ed with this re&s;olution. When it was pre&s;ented, &s;he told them, that they had &s;hewn them&s;elves hone&s;t a&s;&s;ertors of the monarchy, zealous defenders of the con&s;titution, and real friends to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. She thought &s;he had very little rea&s;on to counte|nance a compliment of &s;upererogation to a prince who had caballed with the enemies of her admini&s;tration. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of June the queen
<PB N="403" REF="4060">
clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, expre&s;&s;ing her &s;atisfaction at the addre&s;&s;es and &s;upplies &s;he had received; ob&s;erving, that &s;hould the treaty be broke off, their burthens would be at lea&s;t continued, if not increa&s;ed: that Britain would lo&s;e the pre&s;ent opportunity of improving her own commerce, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a real balance of power in Europe: and, that though &s;ome of the allies might be gainers by a continuance of the war, the re&s;t would &s;uffer in the common ca|lamity. Notwith&s;tanding the ferment of the people, which was now ri&s;en to a very dangerous pitch, addre&s;&s;es approving the queen's conduct were pre&s;ented by the city of London, and all the corporations in the kingdom that e&s;pou&s;ed the Tory intere&s;t. At this juncture the nation was &s;o wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;pirit of party, that no appearance of neutrality or moderation remained.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions the trenches were opened before Que&s;noy, and the &s;iege carried on with uncommon vigour under cover of the forces commanded by the duke of Ormond. This nobleman, however, having received a copy of the articles &s;igned, by the marquis de Torcy, and fre&s;h in&s;tructions from the queen, &s;ignified to prince Eugene and the Dutch deputies, that the French king had agreed to &s;everal articles demanded by the queen, as the foundation of an armi&s;tice; and among others, to put the Engli&s;h troops in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dunkirk: that he could therefore no longer cover the &s;iege of Que&s;noy, as he was obliged by his in&s;tructions to march with the Briti&s;h troops and tho&s;e in the queen's pay; and declare a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms as &s;oon as he &s;hould be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of Dunkirk. He expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that they would readily acquie&s;ce in the&s;e in&s;tructions, as their concurrence would act as the mo&s;t powerful mo|tive to induce the queen to take all po&s;&s;ible care of their intere&s;ts at the con|gre&s;s; and he endeavoured to demon&s;trate, that Dunkirk, as a cautionary town, was a place of greater con&s;equence to the allies than Que&s;noy. The deputies de&s;ired he would delay his march five days, that they might have time to con|&s;ult their principals, and he granted three days without he&s;itation. Prince Eu|gene ob&s;erved, that his marching off with the Briti&s;h troops and the foreigners in the queen's pay, would leave the allies at the mercy of the enemy; but, he hoped the&s;e la&s;t would not obey the duke's order. He and the deputies had already tampered with their commanding officers, who ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to obey the duke of Ormond, alledging, that they could not &s;eparate from the confederacy without expre&s;s directions from their ma&s;ters, to whom they had di&s;patched couriers. An extraordinary a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates was immediately &s;ummoned to meet at the Hague. The mini&s;ters of the allies were invited to the confe|rences. At length, the princes, who&s;e troops were in the pay of Britain, a&s;&s;ured them, that they would maintain them under the command of prince Eugene for one month at their own expence, and afterwards &s;u&s;tain half the charge, provided the other half &s;hould be defrayed by the emperor and &s;tates-general.</P>

<P>The bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol imparted to the other plenipotentiaries at Utrecht, the conce&s;&s;ions which France would make to the allies; and propo&s;ed a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms for two months, that they might treat in a friendly manner, and adju&s;t the demands of all the confederates. To this propo&s;al they made no other an&s;wer, but that they had no in&s;tructions on the &s;ubject. Count Zinzen|dorf, the fir&s;t Imperial plenipotentiary, pre&s;ented a memorial to the &s;tates-general, explaining the danger that would re&s;ult to the common cau&s;e from a
<PB N="404" REF="4070">
ce&s;&s;ation of arms; and exhorting them to per&s;evere in their generous and vigo|rous re&s;olutions. He propo&s;ed a renewal of the alliance for recovering the Spa|ni&s;n monarchy to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and a certain plan for pro&s;ecuting the war with redoubled ardour. Prince Eugene, in order to dazzle the con|federates with &s;ome bold enterprize, detached major-general Grove&s;tein with $$$teen hundred $avalry, to penetrate into the heart of France. This officer, about the middle of June, advanced into Champagne, pa&s;&s;ed the Noire, the Mae&s;e, the Mo&s;eile, and the S$ar, and retired to Traerbach with a rich booty, and a great number of ho&s;tages, after having extorted contributions as far as the g$tes of Metz, ravaged the country, and reduced a great number of villages and towns to a&s;hes The con&s;ternation produced by this irruption reached the city of Paris$ the king of France did not think him&s;elf &s;afe at Ver&s;ailles with his ordinary g$ares$ all the troops in the neighbourhood of the capital were a&s;&s;em|bled about the palace.

By way of re|ta$ation, major-general Pa&s;teur, a famous French partizan, made an excur&s;ion bey$nd Bergen$op-zoom, and ravaged the i&s;land of Tertole belonging to Z$aland.</P>

<P>The earl of Strafford having returned to Holland, propo&s;ed a ce&s;|&s;ation of arms to the &s;tates-general, by whom it was rejected. Then he proceeded to the army of the duke of Ormond, where he arrived in a few days after the reduction of Que&s;noy, the garri&s;on of which were made pri&s;oners of war on the fourth day of July. By this time the officers of the foreign troops had a &s;econd time refu&s;ed to obey a written order of the duke, and &s;uch a &s;pirit of animo&s;ity began to prevail between the Engli&s;h and the allies, that it was judged ab&s;o$utely nece&s;&s;ary to effect a &s;peedy &s;eparation. Prince Eugene re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege of Landrecy: a de&s;ign is &s;aid to have been formed by the German generals to confine the duke, on pretence of the arrears that were due to them; and di&s;arm the Briti&s;h troops, le&s;t they &s;hould join the French army. In the mean time, a literary corre&s;pondence was maintained be|tween the Engli&s;h general and the marechal de Villars. France having con|&s;ented to deliver up Dunkirk, a body of troops was tran&s;ported from England, under the command of Brigadier Hill, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place on the &s;eventh day of July, the French garri&s;on retiring to Winoxberg. On the &s;ix|teenth of the &s;ame month prince Eugene marched from his camp at Ha&s;pre, and was followed by all the auxiliaries in the Briti&s;h pay, except a few batta|lions of the troops of Hol&s;tein-Gottorp, and Walef's regiment of dragoons be|longing to the &s;tate of Liege.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XVI.</HEAD>
<P>Landrecy was immediately inve&s;ted, while the duke of Ormond with the Engli&s;h forces removed from Chateau-Cambre&s;is, and encamped at Ave&s;ne le Seeg, proclaimed by &s;ound of trumpet a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for two months. On the &s;ame day the like armi&s;$$ce was declared in the French army. The Dutch were &s;o exa&s;perated at the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h troops, that the go|vernors would not allow the earl of Strafford to enter Bouchaine, nor the Bri|ti&s;h army to pa&s;s through Doway, though in that town they had left great quan|tity of &s;tores, together with their general-ho&s;pital. Prince Eugene and the
<PB N="405" REF="4080">
Dutch deputies under&s;tanding, that the duke of Ormond had begun his march towards Ghent, began to be in pain for that city, and &s;ent count Na&s;&s;au Wou|denburg to him with a written apology, condemning and di&s;avowing the con|duct of the commandants of Bouchaine and Douay; but, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e excu&s;es, the Engli&s;h troops afterwards met with the &s;ame treatment at Tournay, Oudenarde, and Li&s;le: in&s;ults which were re&s;ented by the whole Briti&s;h nation. The duke, however, pur&s;ued his march, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ghent and Bruges for the queen of England: then he reinforced the garri&s;on of Dunkirk, which he likewi&s;e &s;upplied with artillery and ammunition. His conduct was no le&s;s agreeable to his &s;overeign than mortifying to the Dutch, who never dreamed of leaving Ghent and Bruges in the hands of the Engli&s;h, and were now fairly outwitted, and anticipated by the motions and expedition of the Briti&s;h general.</P>

<DIV4 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XVII.</HEAD>
<P>The lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h forces was &s;oon &s;everely felt in the allied army. Villars attacked a &s;eparate body of their troops encamped at Denain, under the command of the earl of Albemarle. Their intrenchments were forced, and &s;eventeen battalions either killed or taken. The earl him&s;elf and all the &s;urviving officers were made pri&s;oners. Five hundred waggons loaded with bread, twelve pieces of bra&s;s cannon, a large quantity of ammunition and provi&s;ions, a great number of hor&s;es, and a con&s;iderable booty fell into the hands of the enemy; and this advantage they gained in &s;ight of prince Eu|gene, who advanced on the other &s;ide of the Schelde to &s;u&s;tain Albemarle; but the bridge over that river was broke down by accident; &s;o that he was prevented from lending the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance, Villars immediately inve&s;ted Marchiennes, where the principal &s;tores of the allies were lodged. The place was &s;urrendered on the la&s;t day of July; and the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of five thou&s;and men, were conducted pri&s;oners to Valenciennes. He afterwards undertook the &s;iege of Douay; an enterprize, in con&s;equence of which prince Eugene aban|doned his de&s;ign on Landrecy, and marched towards the French, in order to hazard an engagement. The &s;tates, however, would not run the ri&s;que; and the prince had the mortification to &s;ee Douay reduced by the enemy. He could not even prevent their retaking Que&s;noy and Bouchaine, of which places they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion before the tenth day of October; while the allies enjoyed no other compen&s;ation for their great lo&s;&s;es, but the conque&s;t of Fort Knocque, which was &s;urpri&s;ed by one of their parti&s;ans.</P>

<P>The Briti&s;h mini&s;ters at the congre&s;s continued to pre&s;s the Dutch and other allies to join in the armi&s;tice; but they were deaf to the propo&s;al, and concerted mea&s;ures for a vigorous pro&s;ecution of the war. Then the earl of Strafford in&s;i&s;ted upon their admitting to the congre&s;s the plenipotentiaries of king Philip; but he found them equally aver&s;e to this expedient. In the begin|ning of Augu&s;t &s;ecretary St. John, now created lord vi&s;count Bolingbroke, was &s;ent to the court of Ver&s;ailles incognito, to remove all ob&s;tructions to the treaty between England and France. He was accompanled by Mr. Prior and the abb&eacute; Gualtier, treated with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of re&s;pect, care&s;&s;ed by the French king and the marquis de Torcy, with whom he adju&s;ted the princi|pal intere&s;ts of the duke of Savoy and the elector of Bavaria. He &s;ettled the time and manner of the renunciations, and agreed to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms by &s;ea and land for four months between the crowns of France and England; which was
<PB N="406" REF="4090">
accordingly proclaimed at Paris and London. This negotiation being fini&s;hed in a few days, Bolingbroke returned to England, and Prior remained as re&s;ident at the court of France. The &s;tates general breathed nothing but war: the pen&s;ionary Hein&s;ius pronounced an oration in their a&s;&s;embly, repre&s;enting the impo&s;&s;ibility of concluding a peace without lo&s;ing the fruits of all the blood and trea&s;ure they had expended. The conferences at Utrecht were interrupted by a quarrel between the dome&s;tics of Menager and tho&s;e of the count de Rech|teren, one of the Dutch plenipotentiaries. The populace in&s;ulted the earl of Strafford and the marquis del Borgo, mini&s;ter of Savoy, who&s;e ma&s;ter was re|ported to have agreed to the armi&s;tice. The&s;e ob&s;tructions being removed, the conferences were renewed, and the Briti&s;h plenipotentiaries exerted all their rhetoric both in public and private to engage the allies in the queen's mea&s;ures. The duke of Savoy was prevailed upon to acquie&s;ce in the offers of France. Mr. Thomas Harley had been &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to Hanover, with a view to per&s;uade the elector that it would be for his intere&s;t to co-operate with her ma|je&s;ty: but, that prince's re&s;olution was already taken. <Q>&startq;Whenever it &s;hall plea&s;e God (&s;aid he) to call me to the throne of Britain, I hope to act as be|comes me for the advantage of my people: in the mean time &s;peak to me as to a German prince, and a prince of the empire.&endq;</Q> Nor was &s;he more &s;ucce&s;s|ful in her endeavours to bring over the king of Pru&s;&s;ia to her &s;entiments. Lord Lexington was appointed amba&s;&s;ador to Madrid, where king Philip &s;olemnly &s;wore to ob&s;erve the renunciation, which was approved and confirmed by the Cortez. The like renunciation to the crown of Spain was afterwards made by the princes of France: and Philip was declared incapable of &s;ucceeding to the crown of that realm. The court of Portugal held out again&s;t the remon&s;trances of England, until the marquis Bay invaded that kingdom at the head of twenty thou&s;and men, and undertook the &s;iege of Campo-Major, and they found they had no longer any hope of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by her Britannic maje&s;ty. The Por|tugue&s;e mini&s;ter at Utrecht &s;igned the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms on the &s;eventh day of November, and excu&s;ed this &s;tep to the allies, as the pure effect of nece&s;&s;ity. The Engli&s;h troops in Spain were ordered to &s;eparate from the army of count Staremberg, and march to the neighbourhood of Barcelona, where they were embarked on board of an Engli&s;h &s;quadron, commanded by Sir John Jennings, and tran&s;ported to Minorca.</P>

<P>The campaign being at an end in the Netherlands, the duke of Or|mond returned to England, where the party-di&s;putes were become more violent than ever. The Whigs affected to celebrate the anniver&s;ary of the late king's birth-day in London with extraordinary rejoicings. Mobs were hired by both fac|tions, and the whole city was filled with riot and uproar. A ridiculous &s;cheme was contrived to frighten the lord-trea&s;urer with &s;ome &s;quibs in a band-box, which the mini&s;ters magnified into a con&s;piracy. The duke of Hamilton hav|ing been appointed amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to the court of France, the Whigs were alarmed, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that this nobleman favoured the pretender. Some di&s;pute ari&s;ing between the duke and lord Mohun on the &s;ubject of a law|&s;uit, furni&s;hed a pretence for a quarrel. Mohun, who had been twice tried for murder, and was counted a mean tool, as well as the Hector of the Whig party, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age by general Macartney to the duke, challenging him to &s;ingle combat. The principals met by appointment in Hyde park, attended by Ma|cartney
<PB N="407" REF="4100">
and colonel Hamilton. They fought with &s;uch fury, that Mohun was killed upon the &s;pot, and the duke expired before he could be conveyed to his own hou&s;e. Macartney di&s;appeared, and e&s;caped in di&s;gui&s;e to the contiment. Colonel Hamilton declared upon oath before the privy-council, that when the principals engaged, he and Macartney followed their example: that Macartney was immediately di&s;armed; but the colonel &s;eeing the duke fall upon his anta|goni&s;t, threw away the &s;words, and ran to lift him up: that while he was em|ployed in rai&s;ing the duke, Macartney having taken up one of the &s;words, &s;tabbed his grace over Hamilton's &s;houlder, and retired immediately. A pro|clamation was i&s;&s;ued, promi&s;ing a reward of five hundred pounds to tho&s;e who &s;hould apprehend or di&s;cover Macartney, and the dutche&s;s of Hamilton offered three hundred pounds for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The Tories exclaimed again&s;t this event as a party duel: they treated Macartney as a cowardly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; and affirmed, that the Whigs had po&s;ted others of the &s;ame &s;tamp all around Hyde-park, in ca&s;e the duke of Hamilton had triumphed over his an|tagoni&s;t, and e&s;caped the treachery of Macartney. The Whigs, on the other hand, affirm, that it was altogether a private quarrel: that Macartney was in|tirely innocent of the perfidy layed to his charge: that he afterwards &s;ubmitted to a fair trial, at which colonel Hamilton prevaricated in giving his evidence, and was contradicted by the te&s;timony of divers per&s;ons who &s;aw the combat at a di&s;tance. The duke of Marlborough hearing him&s;elf accu&s;ed as the author of tho&s;e party-mi&s;chiefs, and &s;eeing his enemies grow every day more and more implacable, thought proper to retire to the continent, whither he was fol|lowed by his dutche&s;s. His friend Godolphin had died in September, with the general character of an able, cool, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate mini&s;ter, who had rendered him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary to four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;overeigns, and managed the finances with equal &s;kill and integrity. The duke of Shrew&s;bury was nominated amba&s;&s;ador to France, in the room of the duke of Hamilton: the duke D'Aumont arrived at London in the &s;ame quality from the court of Ver&s;ailles; and about the &s;ame time the queen granted an audience to the marquis de Monteleone, whom Philip had appointed one of his plenipotentiaries at the congre&s;s.</P>

<P>In vain had the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters in Holland endeavoured to over|come the ob&s;tinacy of the &s;tates-general, by alternate threats, promi&s;es, and arguments. In vain did they repre&s;ent, that the confederacy again&s;t France could be no longer &s;upported with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s: that the queen's aim had been to procure rea&s;onable terms for her allies; but that their oppo&s;ition to her mea&s;ures prevented her from obtaining &s;uch conditions as &s;he would have a right to demand in their favour, were they unanimous in their con&s;ultations. In November, the earl of Strafford pre&s;ented a new plan of peace, in which the queen promi&s;ed to in&s;i&s;t upon France's ceding to the &s;tates the city of Tournay, and &s;ome other places which they could not expect to po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;hould &s;he conclude a &s;eparate treaty. They now began to waver in their councils. The fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their re&s;entment having &s;ub&s;ided, they plainly perceived that the continuation of the war would intail upon them a burden which they could not bear, e&s;pecially &s;ince the duke of Savoy and the king of Portugal had de&s;erted the alliance: be&s;ides, they were &s;taggered by the affair of the new barrier, &s;o much more advantageous than that which France had propo&s;ed in the beginning of the conferences. They were influenced by another motive:
<PB N="408" REF="4110">
namely, the appr$hen&s;ion of new mi&s;chiefs to the empire from the king of Sweden, who&s;e affairs &s;eemed to take a favourable turn at the Ottoman Porte, through the $nterce&s;&s;ion of the French monarch. The czar and king Augu&s;tus had pe|netrated into Pomerani$: the king of Denmark had taken Staden, reduced Bremen, and $ayed Hamburgh under contribution; but count Steenbock the Swedi&s;h general defeated the Dani&s;h army in Mecklenburg, ravaged Hol&s;tein with great b$rbari$y, and reduced the town of Altena to a&s;hes. The grand &s;ignor threatened to dec$are war again&s;t the czar, on pretence that he had not performed &s;ome e&s;&s;ential articles of the late peace$ but his real motive was an incl$$ation to &s;upport the king of Sweden. This di&s;po&s;ition, however, was de|feated by a powerful party at the Porte, which was aver&s;e to war. Charles, who &s;till remained at Bender, was de&s;ired to return to his own kingdom, and given to under&s;tand, that the &s;ultan would procure him a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age. He treated the per&s;on who brought this intimation with the mo&s;t ou$rageous in&s;o|lence; rejected the propo&s;al, fortified his hou&s;e; and re&s;olved to defend him|&s;elf to the la&s;t extremity. Being attacked by a con&s;iderable body of Turki&s;h forces, he and his attendants fought with the mo&s;t frantic valour. They &s;lew &s;ome hundreds of the a&s;&s;ailants; but, at la&s;t, they &s;et fire to the hou&s;e: &s;o that he was obliged to &s;urrender him&s;elf and his followers, who were generally &s;old for &s;laves. He him&s;elf was conveyed under a &s;trong guard to Adrianople. Mean while the czar landed with an army in Finland, which he totally reduced. Steenbock maintained him&s;elf in Tonningen until all his &s;upplies were cut off; and then he was obliged to deliver him&s;elf and his troops pri&s;oners of war. But this rever&s;e was not fore&s;een when the Dutch dreaded a rupture between the Porte and the Mu&s;covites, and were given to under&s;tand, that the Turks would revive the troubles in Hungary. In that ca&s;e, they knew the emperor would recal great part of his troops from the Netherlands, where the burden of the war mu&s;t lie upon their &s;houlders. After various con&s;ultations in their different a&s;&s;emblies, they came into the queen's mea&s;ures, and figned the barrier|treaty.</P>

<P>Then the plenipo$entiaries of the four a&s;&s;ociated circles pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance to the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters at Utrecht, imploring the queen's inter|po&s;ition in their favour, that they might not be left in the mi&s;erable condition to which they had been reduced by former treaties. They were given to under|&s;tand, that if they &s;hould not obtain what they de&s;ired, they them&s;elves would be ju&s;tly blamed as the authors of their di&s;appointment: that they had been deficient in furni&s;hing their proportion of troops and other nece&s;&s;aries; and left the whole burden of the war to fall upon the queen and the &s;tates in the Ne|therlands: that when a ce&s;&s;ation was judged nece&s;&s;ary, they had de&s;erted her maje&s;ty to follow the chimerical projects of prince Eugene: that, while &s;he pro|&s;ecuted the war with the utmo&s;t vigour, they had acted with coldne&s;s and in|difference; but when &s;he inclined to peace they began to exert them&s;elves in pro&s;ecuting ho&s;tilities with uncommon eagerne&s;s: that, neverthele&s;s, &s;he would no$ abandon their intere&s;ts, but endeavour to procure for them as good con|ditions as their prepo&s;terous conduct would allow her to demand. Even the emperor's plenipotentiaries began to talk in more moderate terms. Zinzendorf declared, that his ma&s;ter was very well di&s;po&s;ed to promote a general peace; and no longer in&s;i&s;ted on a ce&s;&s;ion of the Spani&s;h monarchy to the hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria.

<P>The pacification between France and England was retarded, how|ever, by &s;ome unfore&s;een difficulties that aro&s;e in adju&s;ting the commerce and the limits of the countries po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by both nations in North-America. A long di&s;pute en&s;ued; and the duke of Shrew&s;bury and Prior held many conferences with the French mini&s;try: at length, it was compromi&s;ed, though not much to the advantage of Great Britain; and the Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries received an order to &s;ign a &s;eparate treaty. They declared to the mini&s;ters of the other powers, that they and &s;ome other plenipotentiaries were ready to &s;ign their re|&s;pective treaties on the eleventh day of April. Count Zinzendorf endeavoured to po&s;tpone this tran&s;action until he &s;hould be furni&s;hed with fre&s;h in&s;tructions from Vienna; and even threatened that if the &s;tates &s;hould &s;ign the peace con|trary<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.

The mini&s;ters of Great Britain agreed with tho&s;e of France, that his Imperial maje&s;ty &s;hould have time to con&s;ider whether he would or would not accept the propo&s;als; but this time was extended no farther than the fir&s;t day of June; nor would they agree to a ce&s;&s;ation of arms during that inter|val. Mean while the peace with France was &s;igned in different treaties by the plenipotentiaries of Great Britain, Savoy, Pru&s;&s;ia, Portugal, and the &s;tates-general. On the fourteenth day of the month the Briti&s;h plenipotentiaries de|livered to count Zinzendorf in writing, <Q>&startq;offers and demands of the French king for making peace with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and the empire.&endq;</Q> The count and the mini&s;ters of the German princes exclaimed again&s;t the in&s;olence of France, which had not even be&s;towed the title of emperor on Jo&s;eph; but wanted to impo&s;e terms upon them with relation to the electors of Cologne and Bavaria.</P>

<P>The treaties of peace and commerce between England and France<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1713.</NOTE> being ratified by the queen of England, the parliament was a&s;&s;embled on the ninth day of April. The queen told them the treaty was &s;igned, and that in a few days the ratifications would be exchanged. She &s;aid, what &s;he had done for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the perfect friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between her and the hou&s;e of Hanover, would convince tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to both, and de&s;ired the quiet and &s;afety of their country, how vain all attempts were to divide them. She left it intirely to the hou&s;e of commons to determine what force might be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of trade by &s;ea, and for guards and gar|ri&s;ons. <Q>&startq;Make your&s;elves &s;afe (&s;aid &s;he) and I &s;hall be &s;atisfied. Next to the protection of the divine providence, I depend upon the loyalty and affection of my people. I want no other guaranty.&endq;</Q> She recommended to their pro|tection tho&s;e brave men who had expo&s;ed their lives in the &s;ervice of their coun|try, and could not be employed in time of peace. She de&s;ired they would con|cert proper mea&s;ures for ea&s;ing the foreign trade of the kingdom; for improving and encouraging manufactures and the fi&s;hery; and for employing the hands of idle people. She expre&s;&s;ed her di&s;plea&s;ure at the &s;candalous and &s;editious libels which had been lately publi&s;hed. She exhorted them to con&s;ider of new laws to prevent this licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as well as for putting a &s;top to the impious prac|tice of duelling. She conjured them to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to calm
<PB N="410" REF="4130">
the minds of men at home, that the arts of peace might be cultivated; and that groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies contrived by a faction, and fomented by party-rage, might not effect that which their foreign enem$es could not accompli&s;h. This was the language of a p$ous, candid, and benevolent &s;overeign, who loved her &s;ubjects with a truly parental affection. The parliament con&s;idered her in that light. Each hou&s;e pre&s;ented her with a warm addre&s;s of thanks and congratulation, expre&s;&s;ing in particular, their inviolable attachment to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hanover. The ratifications of the treaty being ex|changed, the peace was proclaimed on the fifth of May, with the u&s;ual cere|$$$nies, to the inexpre&s;&s;$ble joy of the nation in general; and it was about this period, that the chevalier de St. George conveyed a printed remon&s;trance to the mini&s;ters at Utrecht, &s;olemnly prote&s;ting again&s;t all that might be &s;tipulated to his prejudice. The commons, in a &s;econd addre&s;s, had be&s;ought her maje&s;ty to communicate to the hou&s;e in due time the treaties of peace and commerce with France; and now they were produced by Mr. Ben&s;on chancellor of the ex|chequer.</P>

<P>By the treaty of peace the French king obliged him&s;elf to aban|don the pretender, acknowledge the queen's title and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; to raze the fortifications of Dunkirk within a limited time, on condition of receiving an equivalent: to cede Newfoundland, Hud&s;on's-bay, and St. Chri&s;topher's, to England; but, the French were left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cape Breton, and at liberty to dry their fi&s;h on Newfoundland. By the treaty of commerce a free trade was e&s;tabli&s;hed, according to the tariff of the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-four, except in &s;ome commodities that were &s;ubjected to new regulations in the year &s;ixteen hundred and ninety-nine. It was agreed, That no other duties &s;hould be impo&s;ed on the productions of France imported into England, than tho&s;e that were layed on the &s;ame commodities from other countries: and, That commi&s;&s;aries &s;hould meet at London to adju&s;t all matters relating to com|merce: as for the tariff with Spain, it was not yet fini&s;hed. It was &s;tipulated, That the emperor &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the kingdom of Naples, the dutchy of Milan, and the Spani&s;h Netherlands: That the duke of Savoy &s;hould enjoy Sicily, with the title of king: That the &s;ame title, with the i&s;land of Sardinia, &s;hould be allotted to the elector of Bavaria, as an indemnification for his lo&s;&s;es: That the &s;tates-general &s;hould re&s;tore Li&s;te and its dependencies: and, That Namur, Charleroy, Luxemburg, Ypres, and Newport, &s;hould be added to the other places they already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Flanders: That the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould have Upper Gueldre, in lieu of Orange and the other e&s;tates belonging to that family in Franche Comt&eacute;. The king of Portugal was &s;atisfied; and the fir&s;t day of June was fixed as the period of time granted to the emperor for con&s;ide|ration.</P>

<P>A day being appointed by the commons to deliberate upon the treaty $f commerce, very ju&s;t and weighty objections were made to the eighth and ninth artieles, importing, That Great Britain and France &s;hould mutually en|joy all the privileges in trading with each other, that either granted to the mo&s;t favoured nation; and that no higher cu&s;toms &s;hould be exacted from the com|modities of France, than tho&s;e that were drawn from the &s;ame productions of any other people. The balance of trade having long inclined to the &s;ide of France, &s;evere duties had been laid on all the productions and manufactures of
<PB N="411" REF="4140">
that kingdom, &s;o as almo&s;t to amount to a total prohibition. Some members ob&s;erved, that, by the treaty between England and Portugal, the duties charged upon the wines of that country, were lower than tho&s;e layed upon the wines of France: that &s;hould they now be reduced to an equality, the difference of freight was &s;o great, that the French wines would be found much cheaper than tho&s;e of Portugal; and, as they were more agreeable to the ta&s;te of the nation in general, there would be no market for the Portugue&s;e wines in England: that &s;hould this be the ca&s;e, the Engli&s;h would lo&s;e their trade with Portugal, the mo&s;t advantageous of any traffic which they now carried on: for it con|&s;umed a great quantity of their manufactures, and returned a yearly &s;um of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds in gold. Mr. Nathaniel Gould, formerly governor of the bank, affirmed, that as France had, &s;ince the revolution, encouraged woollen manufactures, and prepared at home &s;everal commodities which for|merly they drew from England; &s;o the Engli&s;h had learned to make &s;ilk &s;tuffs, paper, and all manner of toys formerly imported from France: by which means, an infinite number of artificers was employed, and a va&s;t &s;um annually &s;aved to the nation: but the&s;e people would now be reduced to beggary, and that money lo&s;t again to the kingdom, &s;hould French commodities of the &s;ame kind be imported under ordinary duties, becau&s;e labour was much cheaper in France than in England, con&s;equently the Briti&s;h manufactures would be under&s;old and ruined. He urged, that the ruin of the &s;ilk manufacture would be at|tended with another di&s;advantage. Great quantities of woollen cloths were vended in Italy and Turky, in con&s;equence of the raw &s;ilk which the Engli&s;h merchants bought up in tho&s;e countries; and, &s;hould the &s;ilk manufacture at home be lo&s;t, tho&s;e markets for Briti&s;h commodities would fail of cour&s;e. Others alledged, that if the articles of commerce had been &s;ettled before the Engli&s;h troops &s;eparated from tho&s;e of the confederates, the French king would not have pre&s;umed to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch terms, but have been glad to comply with more moderate conditions. Sir William Wyndham reflected on the late mini|&s;try, for having neglected to make an advantageous peace when it was in their power. He &s;aid, that Portugal would always have occa&s;ion for the woollen manufactures and the corn of England, and be obliged to buy them at all events. After a violent debate, the hou&s;e re&s;olved, by a great majority, That a bill &s;hould be brought in to make good the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of commerce with France. Again&s;t the&s;e articles, however, the Por|tugue&s;e mini&s;ter pre&s;ented a memorial, declaring, that &s;hould the duties on French wines be lowered to the &s;ame level with tho&s;e that were layed on the wines of Portugal, his ma&s;ter would renew the prohibition of the woollen ma|nufactures, and other products of Great Britain. Indeed all the trading part of the nation exclaimed again&s;t the treaty of commerce, which &s;eems to have been concluded in a hurry, before the mini&s;ters fully under&s;tood the nature of the &s;ubject. This precipitation was owing to the fears that their endeavours after peace would mi&s;carry, from the intrigues of the Whig faction, and the ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition of the confederates.</P>

<P>The commons having granted an aid of two &s;hillings in the pound, proceeded to renew the duty on malt for another year, and extended this tax to the whole i&s;land, notwith&s;tanding the warm remon&s;trances of the Scotti&s;h members, who repre&s;ented it as a burden which their country could

not $word$ They in&s;i&s;ted upon an expre&s;s article of the union, &s;tipulating, That $o duty &s;hould be $word$ on the m$$t in Scotland during the war, which they affirmed was $word$ $word$ inasmuch as the peace with Spain had not been $word$ During the adjournment of the parliament, on account of the $span$ the Scots if both hou&s;es laying a&s;ide all party-$i$tinctions, $word$ and $word$ on this &s;ubject. They deputed the duke of Argyle, the $word$ of Mar, Mr. Lockhart, and Mr. Cockburne, to lay their grievances be|fore the queen. They repre&s;ented, that their countrymen bore with impatience the violation of &s;ome articles of the union; and that the impo&s;ition of &s;uch an $word$ b$r$$n as the malt-tax, would in all probability prompt them to $word$ the union di&s;&s;olved. The queen, alarmed at this remon&s;trance, an|&s;wered, that &s;he wi&s;hed they might not have cau&s;e to repent of &s;uch a precipi|tate resolution; but &s;he would endeavour to make all things ea&s;y. On the first day of June, the earl of Findlater, in the hou&s;e of peers, repre&s;ented that the Scotti&s;h nation was aggrieved in many in&s;tances: that they were deprived of a privy-council; &s;ubjected to the Engli&s;h laws in ca&s;es of trea&s;on; that their nobles were rendered incapable of being created Briti&s;h peers; and that now they were oppre&s;&s;ed with the in&s;upportable burden of a malt-tax, when they had rea&s;on to expect they &s;hould reap the benefits of peace: he therefore moved, that leave $ight be given to bring in a bill for di&s;&s;olving the union, and &s;e|curing the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the house of Hanover. The lord North and Grey affirmed, that the complaints of the Scots were groundle&s;s; that the di&s;&s;olution of the union was impracticable; and he made &s;ome &s;arca&s;tic reflections on the poverty of that nation. He was an&s;wered by the earl of Eglington, who admitted the Scots were poor, and therefore unable to pay the malt-tax. The earl of Hay, among other pertinent remarks upon the union, ob&s;erved, that when the treaty was made, the Scots took it for granted that the parliament of Great Britain would never load them with any impo&s;ition that they had rea&s;on to believe grievous. The earl of Peterborough compared the union to a marriage. He &s;aid, that though England, who mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed the hu&s;|band, might in &s;ome in&s;tances prove unkind to the lady, &s;he ought not im|mediately to &s;ue for a divorce, the rather becau&s;e &s;he had very much mended her fortune by the match. Ilay replied, that marriage was an ordinance of God; and the union, no more than a political expedient. The other affirmed, that the contract could not have been more &s;olemn, unle&s;s, like the ten com|mendments, it had come from heaven: he inveighed again&s;t the Scots as a people that would never be &s;atisfied; that would have all the advantages re|&s;ulting from the union, but would pay nothing by their good will, although they had received more money from England than the amount of all their e&s;tates. To the&s;e animadver&s;ions the duke of Argyle made a very warm re|ply. <Q>&startq;I have been reflected on by &s;ome people (&s;aid he) as if I was di&s;gu&s;ted and had changed &s;ides; but I de&s;pi&s;e their per&s;ons, as much as I undervalue their judgment.&endq;</Q> He urged, that the malt-tax in Scotland was like taxing land by the acre throughout England, becau&s;e land was worth five pounds an acre in the neighbourhood of London, and would not fetch &s;o many $$$llings in the remote counties. In like manner, the Engli&s;h malt was valued at four times the price of that which was made in Scotland; therefore the tax in this country mu&s;t be levied by a regiment of drag$ons. He owned
<PB N="413" REF="4160">
he had a great &s;hare in making the union, with a view to &s;ecure the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but he was now &s;atisfied this end might be an&s;wered as effectually if the union was di&s;&s;olved; and, if this &s;tep &s;hould not be taken, he did not expect long to have either property left in Scotland, or liberty in England. All the Whig members voted for the di&s;&s;olution of that treaty which they had &s;o eagerly promoted; while the Tories &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported the mea&s;ure again&s;t which they had once argued with &s;uch vehemence. In the cour&s;e of the debate, the lord trea&s;urer ob&s;erved, that although the malt-tax were impo&s;ed, it might be afterwards remitted by the crown. The earl of Sunderland expre&s;&s;ed &s;ur|prize at hearing that noble lord broach a doctrine which tended to e&s;tabli&s;h a de&s;potic di&s;pen&s;ing power and arbitrary government. Oxford replied, his family had never been famous, as &s;ome others had been, for promoting and advi&s;ing arbitrary mea&s;ures. Sunderland con&s;idering this expre&s;&s;ion as a &s;ar|ca&s;m levelled at the memory of his father, took occa&s;ion to vindicate his con|duct; adding, that in tho&s;e days the other lord's family was hardly known. Much violent altercation was di&s;charged. At length the motion for the bill was rejected by a &s;mall majority, and the malt-bill afterwards pa&s;&s;ed with great difficulty.</P>

<P>Another bill being brought into the hou&s;e of commons, for rendering the treaty of commerce effectual, &s;uch a number of petitions were delivered again&s;t it, and &s;o many &s;olid arguments advanced by the merchants who were examined on the &s;ubject, that even a great number of Tory mem|bers were convinced of the bad con&s;equence it would produce to trade, and voted again&s;t the mini&s;try on this occa&s;ion; &s;o that the bill was rejected by a majority of nine voices. At the &s;ame time, however, the hou&s;e agreed to an addre&s;s, thanking her maje&s;ty for the great care &s;he had taken of the &s;ecurity and honour of her kingdoms in the treaty of peace; as al&s;o for having layed &s;o good a foundation for the intere&s;t of her people in trade. They likewi&s;e be|&s;ought her to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with tho&s;e of France, for adju&s;ting &s;uch matters as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;ettled on the &s;ubject of commerce, that the treaty might be explained and perfected for the good and welfare of her people. The queen interpreted this addre&s;s into a full approbation of the treaties of peace and commerce, and thanked them accordingly in the warme&s;t terms of &s;atisfaction and acknowledgment. The commons afterwards de&s;ired to know what equivalent &s;hould be given for the demolition of Dunkirk; and &s;he gave them to under&s;tand, that this was already in the hands of his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty: then they be&s;ought her that &s;he would not evacuate the towns of Flanders that were in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, until tho&s;e who were intitled to the &s;overeignty of the Spani&s;h Netherlands &s;hould agree to &s;uch articles for regu|lating trade as might place the &s;ubjects of Great Britain upon an equal footing with tho&s;e of any other nation. The queen made a favourable an&s;wer to all their remon&s;trances. Such were the &s;teps taken by the parliament during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, with relation to the famous treaty of Utrecht, again&s;t which the Whigs &s;o violently exclaimed, that many well-meaning people believed it would be attended with the immediate ruin of the kingdom: yet, under the &s;hadow of this v$ry treaty, Great Britain enjoyed a long term of peace and tranquillity. Bi&s;hop Burnet was heated with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic terror of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. He declared to the queen in private, that any treaty by which Spain and the
<PB N="414" REF="4170">
We&s;t Indies were left in the hands of king Philip, mu&s;t in a little time deliver all Europe into the hands of France: that if any &s;uch peace was made, the queen was betrayed and her people ruined: that in le&s;s than three years &s;he would be murdered, and the fires would blaze again in Smithfield. This pre|late lived to &s;ee his progno&s;tic di&s;appointed; therefore he might have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this anecdote.</P>

<P>On the twenty-fifth day of June, the queen &s;ignified, in a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e of commons, that her civil li&s;t was burdened with &s;ome debts incurred by &s;everal articles of extraordinary expence; and that &s;he hoped they would impower her to rai&s;e &s;uch a &s;um of money upon the funds for that provi&s;ion, as would be &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the incumbrances, which amounted to five hundred thou&s;and pounds. A bill was immediately prepared for rai&s;ing this &s;um on the civil-li&s;t revenue, and pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es with &s;ome difficulty. Both lords and commons addre&s;&s;ed the queen concerning the che|valier de St. George, who had repaired to Lorrain. They de&s;ired &s;he would pre&s;s the duke of that name, and all the princes and &s;tates in amity with her, to exclude from their dominions the pretender to the imperial crown of Great Britain. A public thank&s;giving for the peace was appointed and celebrated with great &s;olemnity; and, on the &s;ixteenth day of July, the queen clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech which was not at all agreeable to the violent Whigs, be|cau&s;e it did not contain one word about the pretender and the prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. From the&s;e omi&s;&s;ions they concluded, that the dictates of natural af|fection had bia$$ed her in favour of the chevalier de St. George. Whatever &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion &s;he might feel for that unfortunate exile, the acknowledged &s;on of her own father, it does not appear that &s;he ever entertained a thought of altering the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. The term of Sacheverel's &s;u&s;pen&s;ion being expired, extraordinary rejoicings were made upon the occa&s;ion. He was de&s;ired to preach before the hou&s;e of commons, who thanked him for his &s;er$on; and the queen promoted him to the rich benefice of St. Andrew's Holborn. On the other hand, the duke D'Aumont, amba&s;&s;ador from France, was in&s;ulted by the populace. Scurrilous ballads were publi&s;hed again&s;t him, both in the Engli&s;h and French languages. He received divers anonymous letters, containing threats of &s;etting fire to his hou&s;e, which was accordingly burned to the ground, though whether by ac|cident or de&s;ign he could not well determine. The magi&s;tracy of Dunkirk having &s;ent a deputa$ion with an addre&s;s to the queen, humbly imploring her maje&s;ty to &s;pare the port and harbour of that town, and repre&s;enting that they might be u&s;eful to her own &s;ubjects, the memorial was printed and di&s;per&s;ed, and the arguments it contained were an&s;wered and refuted by Addi&s;on, Steele, and Maynwaring. Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent to &s;ee the fortifications of Dun|kirk demoli&s;hed. They were accordingly razed to the ground; the harbour was filled up; and the duke D'Aumont returned to Paris in the month of November. The queen, by her remon&s;trances to the court of Ver&s;ailles, had procured the enlargement of one hundred and thirty-&s;ix prote&s;tants from the gallies; but under&s;tanding that as many more were detained on the &s;ame ac|count, &s;he made &s;uch application to the French mini&s;try, that they too were relea&s;ed. Then &s;he appointed general Ro&s;s her envoy extraordinary to the king of France.</P>

<P>The duke of Shrew&s;bury being nominated lord lieutenant of Ireland, a&s;&s;embled the parliament of that kingdom on the twenty fifth day of November, and found the two hou&s;es &s;till at variance, on the oppo&s;ite principles of Whig and Tory. Allan Broderick being cho&s;en &s;peaker of the commons, they ordered a bill to be brought in to attaint the pretender and all his ad$e|rents. They pro&s;ecuted Edward Loyd for publi&s;hing a book intituled, <Q>&startq;Me|moirs of the chevalier de St. George;&endq;</Q> and they agreed upon an addre&s;s to the queen, to remove from the chancellor&s;hip Sir Con&s;tantine Phipps, who had countenanced the Tories of that kingdom. The lords, however, re&s;olved, that chancellor Phipps had, in his &s;everal &s;tations, acquitted him&s;elf with honour and integrity. The two hou&s;es of convocation pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. They likewi&s;e complained of Mr. Mole&s;worth, for ha|ving in&s;ulted them, by &s;aying, when they appeared in the ca&s;tle of Dublin, "They that have turned the world up&s;ide down are come hither al&s;o;" and he was removed from the privy-council. The duke of Shrew&s;bury received orders to prorogue this parliament, which was divided again&s;t it&s;elf, and portended nothing but dome&s;tic broils. Then he obtained leave to return to England, leaving chancellor Phipps, with the archbi&s;hops of Armagh and Tuam, ju&s;tices of the kingdom.</P>

<P>The parliament of England had been di&s;&s;olved; and the elections were managed in &s;uch a manner as to retain the legi&s;lative power in the hands of the Tories: but the meeting of the new parliament was delayed by repeated pro|rogations to the tenth day of December; a delay partly owing to the queen's indi&s;po&s;ition; and partly to the conte&s;ts among her mini&s;ters. Oxford and Bo|lingbroke were competitors for power, and rivals in reputation for ability. The trea&s;urer's parts were deemed the more &s;olid; the &s;ecretary's more &s;hining: but both mini&s;ters were a&s;piring and ambitious. The fir&s;t was bent upon main|taining the fir&s;t rank in the admini&s;tration, which he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ince the re|volution in the mini&s;try: the other di&s;dained to act as a &s;ubaltern to the man whom he thought he excelled in genius and equalled in importance. They began to form &s;eparate cabals, and adopt different principles. Bolingbroke in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the confidence of lady Ma&s;ham, to whom Oxford had given &s;ome cau&s;e of di&s;gu&s;t. By this communication he gained ground in the good opinion of his &s;overeign, while the trea&s;urer lo&s;t it in the &s;ame pro|portion. Thus &s;he who had been the author of his elevation, was now u&s;ed as the in&s;trument of his di&s;grace. The queen was &s;en&s;ibly affected with the&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions, which &s;he interpo&s;ed her advice and authority by turns to appea&s;e; but their mutual animo&s;ity continued to rankle under an exterior accommoda|tion. The intere&s;t of Bolingbroke was powerfully &s;upported by Sir Simon Harcourt the chancellor, Sir William Wyndham, and Mr. &s;ecretary Bromley. Oxford perceived his own influence was in the wane, and began to think of re|tirement. Mean while, the earl of Peterborough was appointed amba&s;&s;ador to the king of Sicily; and &s;et out for Turin. The queen retired to Wind&s;or, where &s;he was &s;eized with a very dangerous inflammatory fever. The hopes of the Jacobites vi&s;ibly ro&s;e: the public funds immediately fell: a great run was made upon the bank, the directors of which were overwhelmed with con|&s;ternation, which was not a little increa&s;ed by the report of an armament equipped in the ports of France. They &s;ent one of their members to repre&s;ent
<PB N="416" REF="4190">
to the trea&s;urer the danger that threatened the public credit. The queen being made acquainted with the&s;e occurrences, &s;igned a letter to Sir Samuel Stancer lord-mayor of London, declaring, that now &s;he was recovered of her late in|di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he would return to the place of her u&s;ual re&s;idence, and open the parliament on the &s;ixteenth day of February. This intimation &s;he &s;ent to her loving &s;ubjects of the city of London, to the intent that all of them, in their &s;everal &s;tations, might di&s;countenance tho&s;e malicious rumours &s;pread by evil|minded per&s;ons, to the prejudice of credit, and to the imminent hazard of the public peace and tranquillity. The queen's recovery, together with certain in|telligence that the armament was a phantom, and the pretender &s;till in Lor|rain, helped to a&s;&s;uage the ferment of the nation, which had been indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly rai&s;ed by party-writings. Mr. Richard Steele publi&s;hed a performance intituled "The Cri&s;is," in defence of the revolution, and the prote&s;tant e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, and enlarging upon the danger of popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or. On the other hand, the hereditary rights of the crown of England was a&s;&s;erted in a large volume, &s;uppo&s;ed to be written with a view to pave the way for the pre|tender's acce&s;&s;ion. One Bedford was apprehended, tried, convicted, and &s;e|verely puni&s;hed, as the publi&s;her of this treati&s;e.</P>

<P>While England was harra&s;&s;ed by the&s;e inte&s;tine commotions, the emperor rejecting the terms of peace propo&s;ed by France, re&s;olved to main|tain the war at his own expence, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the empire. His forces on the Rhine, commanded by prince Eugene, was &s;o much outnumbered by the French under Villars, that they could not prevent the enemy from reducing the two important fortre&s;&s;es of Landau and Friburg. His Imperial maje&s;ty hoped, that the death of queen Anne, or that of Lewis XIV. would produce an alteration in Europe that might be favourable to his intere&s;t; and he de|pended upon the conduct and fortune of prince Eugene for &s;ome lucky event in war. But finding him&s;elf di&s;appointed in all the&s;e expectations, and ab&s;olutely unable to &s;upport the expence of another campaign, he hearkened to over|tures of peace that were made by the electors of Cologne and Palatine; and conferences were opened at the ca&s;tle of Al-Ra&s;tadt, between prince Eugene and marechal de Villars, on the twenty &s;ixth day of November. In the be|ginning of February they &s;eparated, without &s;eeming to have come to any conclu&s;ion: but all the articles being &s;ettled between the courts of Vienna and Ver&s;ailles, they met again at the latter end of the month: the treaty was &s;igned on the third day of March; and orders were &s;ent to the governors and com|manders on both &s;ides, to de&s;i&s;t from all ho&s;tilities. By this treaty, the French king yielded to the emperor Old Bri&s;ac, with all its dependencies, Friburg, the forts in the Bri&s;gau and Black Fore&s;t, together with fort Khel. He engaged to demoli&s;h the fortifications oppo&s;ite to Huningen, the fort of Sellingen, and all between that and Fort Louis. The town and fortre&s;s of Landau were ceded to the king of France, who acknowledged the elector of Hanover. The elec|tors of Bavaria and Cologne were re&s;tored to all their dignities and dominions. The emperor was put in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Spani&s;h Netherlands; and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was permitted to retain the high quarter of Gueldres. Finally, the contracting parties agreed that a congre&s;s &s;hould be opened on the fir&s;t of May, at Baden in Swi&s;&s;erland, for terminating all differences; and prince Eugene and marechal de Villars were appointed their fir&s;t plenipotentiaries.</P>

<P>The ratifications of the treaty between Great Britain and Spain being exchanged, the peace was proclaimed on the fir&s;t day of March, in London; and the articles were not di&s;agreeable to the Engli&s;h nation. The kingdoms of France and Spain were &s;eparated for ever. Philip acknowledged the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and renounced the pretender. He agreed to a renewal of the treaty of navigation and commerce concluded in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-&s;even. He granted an exclu&s;ive privilege to the Engli&s;h for fur|ni&s;hing the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies with negroes, according to the a&s;&s;iento-con|tract. He ceded Gibraltar to England, as well as the i&s;land of Minorca, on condition that the Spani&s;h inhabitants &s;hould enjoy their e&s;tates and religion. He obliged him&s;elf to grant a full pardon to the Catalonians, with the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their e&s;tates, honours, and privileges, and to yield the kingdom of Sicily to the duke of Savoy. The new parliament was opened by com|mi&s;&s;ion in February, and Sir Thomas Hanmer was cho&s;en &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons. On the &s;econd day of March, the queen being carried in a &s;edan to the hou&s;e of lords, &s;ignified to both hou&s;es, that &s;he had obtained an honourable and advantageous peace for her own people, and for the greate&s;t part of her allies; and &s;he hoped her interpo&s;ition might prove effectual to complete the &s;ettlement of Europe. She ob&s;erved, that &s;ome per&s;ons had been &s;o malicious as to in&s;inuate that the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Ha|nover was in danger under her government; but that tho&s;e who endeavoured to di&s;tract the minds of men with imaginary dangers, could only mean to di&s;turb the public tranquillity. She &s;aid, that after all &s;he had done to &s;ecure religion and the liberties of her people, &s;he could not mention &s;uch proceedings without &s;ome degree of warmth; and &s;he hoped her parliament would agree with her, that attempts to weaken her authority, or to render the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown unea&s;y to her, could never be proper means to &s;trengthen the pro|te&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Affectionate addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented by the lords, the com|mons, and the convocation: but the ill humour of party &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and was daily inflamed by new pamphlets and papers. Steele, &s;upported by Ad|di&s;on and Hallifax, appeared in the front of tho&s;e who drew their pens in de|fence of Whig principles; and Swift was the champion of the mini&s;try.</P>

<P>The earl of Wharton complained in the hou&s;e of lords of a libel intituled, <Q>&startq;The public &s;pirit of the Whigs, &s;et forth in their ge|nerous encouragement of the author of the Cri&s;is.&endq;</Q> It was a &s;arca&s;tic per|formance, imputed to lord Bolingbroke and Swift, inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;evere re|flections upon the union, the Scotti&s;h nation, and the duke of Argyle in par|ticular. The lord trea&s;urer di&s;claimed all knowledge of the author, and readily concurred in an order for taking into cu&s;tody John Morphew the pub|li&s;her, as well as John Barber, printer of the Gazette, from who&s;e hou&s;e the copies were brought to Morphew. The earl of Wharton &s;aid it highly con|cerned the honour of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, to find out the villain who was author of that fal&s;e and &s;candalous libel, that ju&s;tice might be done to the Scotti&s;h nation. He moved, that Barber and his &s;ervants might be examined: but, next day, the earl of Mar, one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, declared, that, in pur&s;uance to her maje&s;ty's command, he had directed John Barber to be pro&s;ecuted. Notwith&s;tanding this interpo&s;ition, which was calculated to &s;creen the offenders, the lords pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, be&s;eeching her maje&s;ty to i&s;&s;ue

out her royal proclamation, promi&s;ing a reward to any per&s;on who &s;hould di&s;|cover the author of the libel which they conceived to be fal&s;e, malicious, and factious, highly di&s;honourable and &s;candalous to her maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects of Scot|land, mo&s;t injurious to her maje&s;ty, and tending to the ruin of the con&s;titu|tion. In compliance with their reque&s;t, a reward of three hundred pounds was offered; but the author remained &s;afe from all detection.</P>

<P>The commons having granted the &s;upplies, ordered a bill to be brought in for &s;ecuring the freedom of parliaments, by limiting the number of officers in the hou&s;e of commons; and it pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es with little difficulty. In March, a complaint was made of &s;everal &s;candalous papers lately publi&s;hed, under the name of Richard Steele, e&s;quire, a member of the hou&s;e. Sir William Wyndham ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of that author's writings contained in&s;olent, injurious, reflections on the queen her&s;elf, and were dictated by the &s;pirit of rebellion. Steele was ordered to attend in his place: &s;ome pa|ragraphs of his works were read; and he an&s;wered them with an affected air of &s;elf-confidence and unconcern. A day being appointed for his trial, he acknow|ledged the writings, and entered into a more circum&s;tantial defence. He was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. Addi&s;on, general Stanhope, and Mr. Walpole; and attacked by Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Foley, and the attorney general. Whatever could be urged in his favour was but little regarded by the majority, which voted, that two pamphlets, intituled, "The Engli&s;hman, and the Cri&s;is," written by Richard Steele, e&s;quire, were &s;candalous and &s;editious libels; and that he &s;hould be expelled the hou&s;e of commons.</P>

<P>The lords taking into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the nation, re|&s;olved upon addre&s;&s;es to the queen, de&s;iring they might know what &s;teps had been taken for removing the pretender from the dominions of the duke of Lor|rain: that &s;he would impart to them an account of the negotiations of peace; an account of the in&s;tances which had been made in favour of the Catalans; and an account of the monies granted by parliament &s;ince the year one thou|&s;and &s;even hundred and ten, to carry on the war in Spain and Portugal. They afterwards agreed to other addre&s;&s;es, be&s;eeching her maje&s;ty to lay before them the debts and &s;tate of the navy, the particular writs of Noli pro&s;equi granted &s;ince her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; and a li&s;t of &s;uch per&s;ons as, notwith&s;tanding &s;entence of outlawry or attainder, had obtained licences to return into Great Britain, or other her maje&s;ty's dominions &s;ince the revolution. Having voted an application to the queen in behalf of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Catalans, the hou&s;e ad|journed it&s;elf to the la&s;t day of March. As the minds of men had been artfully irritated by fal&s;e reports of a de&s;ign undertaken by France in behalf of the pre|tender, the amba&s;&s;ador of that crown at the Hague di&s;owned it in a public paper, by command of his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty. The &s;u&s;picions of many people, however, had been too deeply planted by the arts and in&s;inuations of the Whig leaders, to be eradicated by this or any other declaration; and what &s;erved to rivet their apprehen&s;ions, was a total removal of the Whigs from all the employments civil and military which they had hitherto retained. The&s;e were now be&s;towed upon profe&s;&s;ed Tories, &s;ome of whom were attached at bottom to the &s;uppo&s;ed heir of blood. At a time when the queen's views were maliciou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented; when the wheels of her government were actually impeded, and her &s;ervants threatened with pro&s;cription by a powerful, turbu|lent,

and implacable faction; no wonder that &s;he di&s;charged the parti&s;ans of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boyer. Burnet. Tindal. Torcy. Boling broke. Voltaire.</NOTE> that faction from her &s;ervice, and filled their places with tho&s;e who were di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a warm affection to the hou&s;e of Stuart, and by a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive re&s;pect for the regal authority. Tho&s;e were &s;teps which her own &s;agacity mu&s;t have &s;ugge&s;ted; and which her mini&s;ters would naturally advi&s;e as nece&s;&s;ary for their own pre&s;ervation. The Whigs were all in commotion, either apprehending, or affecting to apprehend, that a de&s;ign was formed to &s;ecure the pretender's &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion to the throne of Great Britain. Their chiefs held &s;ecret con&s;ultations with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1714.</NOTE> baron Schutz, the re&s;ident from Hanover. They communicated their ob&s;erva|tions to the elector: they received his in&s;tructions; they maintained a corre|&s;pondence with the duke of Marlborough; and they concerted mea&s;ures for op|po&s;ing all efforts that might be made again&s;t the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion upon the death of the queen, who&s;e health was by this time &s;o much impaired, that every week was believed to be the la&s;t of her life. This conduct of the Whigs was re&s;olute, active, and would have been laudable, had their zeal been confined within the bounds of truth and moderation; but they, moreover, employed all their arts to excite and encourage the fears and jealou&s;ies of the people.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e of peers re&s;ounded with debates upon the Catalans, the pretender, and the danger that threatened the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. With re&s;pect to the Catalonians, they repre&s;ented, that Great Britain had prevailed upon them to declare for the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, with promi&s;e of &s;upport; and that the&s;e engagements ought to have been made good. Lord Bolingbroke de|clared, that the queen had u&s;ed all her endeavours in their behalf; and that her engagements with them &s;ub&s;i&s;ted no longer than king Charles re&s;ided in Spain. They agreed, however, to an addre&s;s, acknowledging her maje&s;ty's endeavours in favour of the Catalans, and reque&s;ting &s;he would continue her interpo&s;ition in their behalf. With re&s;pect to the pretender, the Whig lords expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a &s;pirit of per&s;ecution and rancorous hate, as would have di&s;graced the members of any, even the lowe&s;t a&s;&s;embly of chri&s;tians. Not contented with hunting him from one country to another, they &s;eemed eagerly bent upon extirpating him from the face of the earth, as if they had thought it was a crime in him to be born. The earl of Sunderland declared, from the information of the mini&s;ter of Lorrain, that notwith&s;tanding the application of both hou&s;es to her ma|je&s;ty during the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, concerning the pretender's being removed from Lorrain, no in&s;tances had yet been made to the duke for that purpo&s;e. Lord Bolingbroke affirmed, that he him&s;elf had made tho&s;e in&s;tances in the queen's name, to that very mini&s;ter before his departure from England. The earl of Wharton propo&s;ed a que&s;tion, <Q>&startq;Whether the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was in danger under the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration?&endq;</Q> A warm debate en&s;ued, in which the arch|bi&s;hop of York and the earl of Angle&s;ey joined in the oppo&s;ition to the mini&s;try. The earl pretended to be convinced and converted by the arguments u&s;ed in the cour&s;e of the debate. He owned he had given his a&s;&s;ent to the ce&s;&s;ation of arms, for which he took &s;hame to him&s;elf, a&s;king pardon of God, his country, and his con&s;cience. He affirmed, that the honour of his &s;overeign, and the good of his country, were the rules of his actions; but, that without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, &s;hould he find him&s;elf impo&s;ed upon, he dur&s;t pur&s;ue an evil mini&s;ter from the queen's clo&s;et to the Tower, and from the Tower to the &s;caffold.
<PB N="420" REF="4230">
This conver&s;ion, however, was much more owing to a full per&s;ua&s;ion, that a mini&s;try divided again&s;t it&s;elf could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and, that the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was firmly &s;ecured. He $word$ re&s;olved to make a merit of with|drawing him&s;elf from the intere&s;ts of a $ottering admini&s;tration, in who&s;e ruin he night be involved. The $$ke of Arg$l$ charged the mini&s;ters with $span$ within tho&s;e walls and without: he offered to prove, that $span$ had yearly remitted a &s;um of money to the Highland $span$ Scotland, who were $word$ to $word$ in$rely devoted to the pretender. He affirmed, that the new $word$ of the army, the practice of $$band|ing &s;ame regiments out of their turn, and removing a great number of $word$ on $ccount of their $word$ $word$ to the $word$ of Hanover, were $$ar $span$ of the $word$ $word$ that it was a e$$grace to the nation to &s;ee men who had never looked an $word$ in the face, advanced to the po&s;ts of &s;everal brave officers, who, after they had often expo&s;ed their lives for their country, were now &s;tarving in pri&s;on for debt, on account of their pay's being detained. The trea&s;urer laying his hand upon his brea&s;t, &s;aid, he had on &s;o many occa&s;ions given &s;uch &s;ignal proofs of affection to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, that he was &s;ure no member of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly did call it in que&s;|tion. He owned he had remitted for two or three years pa&s;t, between three and four thou&s;and pounds to the Highland clans; and he hoped the hou&s;e would give him an opportunity to clear his conduct in that particular; and, with re&s;pect to the reformed officers, he declared, he had given orders for their being immedi|ately payed. The prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was voted out of danger by a &s;mall ma|jority.</P>

<P>Lord Hallifax propo&s;ed an addre&s;s to the queen, that &s;he would renew her in&s;tances for the &s;peedy removing the pretender out of Lorrain; and that &s;he would, in conjunction with the &s;tates general, enter into the gua|ranty of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hanover. The earl of Whar|tin moved, that in the addre&s;s her maje&s;ty &s;hould be de&s;ired to i&s;&s;ue a procla|mation, promi&s;ing a reward to any per&s;on who &s;hould apprehend the pretender dead or alive. He was &s;econded by the duke of Bolton; and the hou&s;e agreed, that an addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented. When it was reported by the committee, the lord North and Grey expatiated upon the barbarity of &s;etting a price on any one's head: he proved it was an encouragement to murder and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; contrary to the precepts of Chri&s;tianity: repugnant to the law of nature and nations; incon&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of &s;uch an augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, was with the honour of a nation famed for lenity and mercy. He was &s;upported by lord Frevor, who moved, that the reward &s;hould be promi&s;ed for apprehend|ing and bringing the pretender to $u&s;tice, in ca&s;e he &s;hould land or attempt to land in Great Britain or Ireland. The cruelty of the fir&s;t clau&s;e was zealou&s;ly &s;upported and vindicared by the lords Cowper and Hallifax; but, by this time the earls of Angle&s;ey and &s;ome others who had abandoned the mini&s;try, were brought back their former principles, by promi&s;e of profitable employments; and the mitigation was adopted by a majority of ten voices. To this addre&s;s, which was delivered by the chancellor and the Whig lords only, the queen re|plied in the&s;e words. <Q>&startq;My lords, it would be a real &s;trengthening to the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hanover, as well as a &s;upport to my government,
<PB N="421" REF="4240">
that an end were put to tho&s;e groundle&s;s fears and jealou&s;ies which have been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly promoted. I do not at this time &s;ee any occa&s;ion for &s;uch a proclamation. Whenever I judge it to be nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall give my orders for having it i&s;&s;ued. As to the other particulars of this addre&s;s, I will give proper directions therein.&endq;</Q> She was likewi&s;e importuned by another addre&s;s, to i&s;&s;ue out a proclamation again&s;t all je&s;uits, popi&s;h prie&s;ts, and bi&s;hops, as well as again&s;t all &s;uch as were outlawed for adhering to the late king James and the pretender. They re&s;olved, That no per&s;on, not included in the articles of Li|merick, and who had borne arms in France and Spain, &s;hould be capable of any employment civil or military: and, That no per&s;on, a natural-born &s;ubject of her maje&s;ty, &s;hould be capable of &s;u&s;taining the character of a public mi|ni&s;ter from any foreign potentate. The&s;e re&s;olutions were aimed at Sir Patrick Lawle&s;s, an Iri&s;h papi&s;t, who had come to England with a credential letter from king Philip, but now thought proper to quit the kingdom.</P>

<P>Then the lords in the oppo&s;ition made an attack upon the trea|&s;urer, concerning the money he had remitted to the Highlanders; but he &s;ilenced his oppo&s;ers, by a&s;&s;erting, that in &s;o doing, he had followed the exam|ple of king William, who, after he had reduced that people, thought fit to allow yearly pen&s;ions to the heads of clans, in order to keep them quiet. His conduct was approved by the hou&s;e; and the lord North and Grey moved, That a day might be appointed for con&s;idering the &s;tate of the nation, with regard to the treaties of peace and commerce. The motion was &s;econded by the earl of Cla|rendon; and the thirteenth day of April fixed for this purpo&s;e. In the mean time, baron Schutz demanded of the chancellor a writ for the electoral prince of Hanover, to &s;it in the hou&s;e of peers as duke of Cambridge, intimating, that his de&s;ign was to re&s;ide in England. The writ was granted with reluctance; but the prince's de&s;ign of coming to England was &s;o di&s;agreeable to the queen, that &s;he &s;ignified her di&s;approbation of &s;uch a &s;tep, in a letter to the prince&s;s Sophia. She ob&s;erved, that &s;uch a method of proceeding would be dangerous to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, which was not &s;ecure any other way, than as the prince who was in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne maintained her authority and prero|gative: &s;he &s;aid, a great many people in England were &s;editiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed; &s;o &s;he left her to judge, what tumults they might be able to rai&s;e &s;hould they have a pretext to begin a commotion: &s;he therefore per&s;uaded her&s;elf, that her aunt would not con&s;ent to any thing which might di&s;turb the repo&s;e of her and her &s;ubjects. At the &s;ame time &s;he wrote a letter to the electoral prince, complain|ing, that he had formed &s;uch a re&s;olution without fir&s;t knowing her &s;entiments on the &s;ubject; and telling him plainly, that nothing could be more dangerous to the tranquillity of her dominions, to the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the Hanoverian line, or more di&s;agreeable to her, than &s;uch conduct at this juncture. A third letter was written to the elector his father; and the trea&s;urer took this opportu|nity to a&s;&s;ure that prince of his inviolable attachment to the family of Ha|nover.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The Whig lords were di&s;&s;atisfied with the queen's an&s;wer to their addre&s;s concerning the pretender; and they moved for another addre&s;s on the &s;ame &s;ubject, which was re&s;olved upon, but never pre&s;ented. They took into con&s;ideration the treaties of peace and commerce, to which many exceptions
<PB N="422" REF="4250">
were taken; and much &s;arca&s;m was expended on both &s;ides of the di&s;pute; but, at length, the majority carried the que&s;tion in favour of an addre&s;s, acknow|ledging her maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s, in delivering them by a &s;afe, honourable, and advantageous peace with France, from the burden of a con&s;uming land-war, un|equally carried on, and become at la&s;t impracticable. The hou&s;e of commons concurred in this addre&s;s, after having voted, That the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was out of danger; but the&s;e re&s;olutions were not taken without violent oppo&s;ition, in which general Stanhope, Mr. Lechmere, and Mr. Walpole, chiefly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves. The letters which the queen had written to the electoral hou&s;e of Hanover were printed and publi&s;hed in England, with a view to in|form the friends of that family, of the rea&s;ons which prevented the duke of Cambridge from executing his de&s;ign of re&s;iding in Great Britain. The queen con&s;idered this &s;tep as a per&s;onal in&s;ult, as well as an attempt to prejudice her in the opinions of her &s;ubjects: &s;he therefore ordered the publi&s;her to be taken into cu&s;tody. At this period the prince&s;s Sophia died, in the eighty-fourth year of her age; and her death was intimated to the queen by baron Bothmar, who arrived in England with the character of envoy-extraordinary from the elec|tor of Hanover. This prince&s;s was the fourth and younge&s;t daughter of Fre|derick elector palatine, king of Bohemia, and Elizabeth, daughter of king James I. of England. She enjoyed from nature an excellent capacity, which was finely cultivated; and was in all re&s;pects one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed prin|ce&s;&s;es of the age in which &s;he lived. At her death the court of England ap|peared in mourning; and the elector of Brun&s;wick was prayed for by name in the liturgy of the church of England. On the twelfth day of May Sir William Wyndham made a motion for a bill to prevent the growth of &s;chi&s;m, and for the further &s;ecurity of the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. The de|&s;ign of it was to prohibit di&s;&s;enters from teaching in &s;chools and academies. It was accordingly prepared, and eagerly oppo&s;ed in each hou&s;e as a &s;pecies of per&s;ecution. Neverthele&s;s, it made its way through both, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent; but the queen dying before it took place, this law was rendered ineffectual.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="40" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XL.</HEAD>
<P>Her maje&s;ty's con&s;titution was now quite broken: one fit of &s;ickne&s;s &s;ucceeded another; and what completed the ruin of her health was the anxiety of her mind, occa&s;ioned partly by the di&s;contents which had been rai&s;ed and fomented by the enemies of her government; and partly by the di&s;&s;en&s;ions among her mini&s;ters, which were now become intolerable. The council-chamber was turned into a &s;cene of ob&s;tinate di&s;pute and bitter altercation. Even in the queen's pre&s;ence, the trea&s;urer and &s;ecretary did not ab&s;tain from mutual obloquy and reproach. Oxford advi&s;ed moderate mea&s;ures, and is &s;aid to have made advances towards a reconciliation with the leaders of the Whig party. As he fore&s;aw it would &s;oon be their turn to domineer, &s;uch precautions were nece&s;&s;ary for his own &s;afety. Bolingbroke affected to &s;et the Whigs at de|fiance: he profe&s;&s;ed a warm zeal for the church: he &s;oothed the queen's inclina|tions with the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous attention. He and his coadjutrix in&s;inuated, that the trea&s;urer was bia&s;&s;ed in favour of the di&s;&s;enters, and even, that he acted as a &s;py for the hou&s;e of Hanover. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e di&s;putes and commotions the Jacobites were not idle. They flattered them&s;elves, that the queen in &s;ecret
<PB N="423" REF="4260">
favoured the preten&s;ions of her brother; and they depended upon Bolingbroke's attachment to the &s;ame intere&s;t. They believed the &s;ame &s;entiments were che|ri&s;hed by the nation in general. They held private a&s;&s;emblies both in Great Britain and Ireland. They concerted mea&s;ures for turning the di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the kingdom to the advantage of their cau&s;e. They even proceeded &s;o far as to inli&s;t men for the &s;ervice of the pretender. Some of the&s;e practices were di&s;covered by the earl of Wharton, who did not fail to &s;ound the alarm. A proclamation was immediately publi&s;hed, promi&s;ing a reward of five thou&s;and pounds for apprehending the pretender whenever he &s;hould land or attempt to land in Great Britain. The commons voted an addre&s;s of thanks for the pro|clamation; and a&s;&s;ured her maje&s;ty, that they would chearfully aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t her, by granting the &s;um of an hundred thou&s;and pounds as a further reward to any who &s;hould perform &s;o great a &s;ervice to her maje&s;ty and her kingdoms. The lords likewi&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Lord Bolingbroke propo&s;ed a bill, decreeing the penalties of high-trea&s;on again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould li&s;t or be inli&s;ted in the pretender's &s;ervice. The motion was approved, and the penalty extended to all tho&s;e who &s;hould li&s;t or be inli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of any foreign prince or &s;tate, without a licence under the &s;ign manual of her maje&s;ty, her heirs, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>

<P>On the &s;econd day of July the lords took into con&s;ideration the treaty of commerce with Spain; and a good number of merchants being exa|mined at the bar of the hou&s;e, declared, that unle&s;s the explanations of the third, fifth, and eighth articles, as made at Madrid after the treaty was &s;igned, were re&s;cinded, they could not carry on their commerce without lo&s;ing five and twenty per cent. After a long debate, the hou&s;e re&s;olved to addre&s;s the queen for all the papers relating to the negotiation of the treaty of commerce with Spain, with the names of the per&s;ons who advi&s;ed her maje&s;ty to that treaty. To this addre&s;s &s;he replied, that under&s;tanding the three explanatory articles of the treaty were not detrimental to the trade of her &s;ubjects, &s;he had con|&s;ented to their being ratified with the treaty. The earl of Wharton repre&s;ented, that if &s;o little regard was &s;hewn to the addre&s;ies of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly to the &s;overeign, they had no bu&s;ine&s;s in that hou&s;e. He moved for a remon|&s;trance to lay before her maje&s;ty, the in&s;uperable difficulties that attended the Spani&s;h trade on the footing of the late treaty; and the hou&s;e agreed to his motion. Another member moved, That the hou&s;e &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on her maje&s;ty's naming the per&s;ons who advi&s;ed her to ratify the three explanatory articles. This was a blow aimed at Arthur Moore, a member of the lower hou&s;e, whom lord Bolingbroke had con&s;ulted on the &s;ubject of the treaty. He was &s;creened by the majority in parliament; but, a general court of the South-&s;ea company re&s;olved, upon a complaint exhibited by captain John&s;on, that Arthur Moore, while a director, was privy to, and encouraged the de&s;ign of carrying on a clan|de&s;tine trade, to the prejudice of the corporation, contrary to his oath, and in breach of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him: that, therefore, he &s;hould be declared inca|pable of being a director of, or having any employment in this company. The queen had re&s;erved to her&s;elf the quarter part of the a&s;&s;ento-contract, which &s;he now gave up to the company, and received the thanks of the upper hou&s;e; but, &s;he would not di&s;cover the names of tho&s;e who advi&s;ed her to ratify the
<PB N="424" REF="4270">
explanatory articles. On the ninth day of July &s;he thought proper to put an and to the &s;e&s;&s;ion, with a &s;peech on the u&s;ual &s;ubjects. After having a&s;&s;ured them, that her chief concern was to pre&s;erve the prote&s;tant religion, the liberty of her &s;ubjects, and to &s;ecure the tranquillity of her kingdoms, &s;he concluded in the&s;e words, <Q>&startq;But, I mu&s;t tell you plainly, that the&s;e de&s;irable ends can never be obtained, unle&s;s you bring the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions on your parts; un|le&s;s all groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies which create and foment divi&s;ions among you, be layed a&s;ide; and unle&s;s you &s;hew the &s;ame regard for my ju&s;t prerogative, and for the honour of my government, as I have always expre&s;&s;ed for the rights of my people.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>After the peace had thus received the &s;anction of the parliament, the mini&s;ters being no longer re&s;trained by the tie of common danger, gave a loo&s;e to their mutual animo&s;ity. Oxford wrote a letter to the queen, containing a detail of the public tran&s;actions; in the cour&s;e of which he endeavoured to ju&s;tify his own conduct, and expo&s;e the turbulent and ambitious &s;pirit of his rival. On the other hand, Bolingbroke charged the trea&s;urer with having in|vited the duke of Marlborough to return from his voluntary exile; and main|tained a private corre&s;pondence with the hou&s;e of Hanover. The duke of Shrew&s;bury likewi&s;e complained of his having pre&s;umed to &s;end orders to him in Ireland, without the privity of her maje&s;ty and the council. In all probabi|lity, his greate&s;t crime was, his having given umbrage to the favourite lady Ma&s;ham. Certain it is, on the twenty-&s;eventh day of July a very acrimonious dialogue pa&s;&s;ed between that lady, the chancellor, and Oxford, in the queen's pre&s;ence. The trea&s;urer affirmed he had been wronged, and abu&s;ed by lies and mi&s;repre&s;entations; but, he threatened vengeance, declaring he would leave &s;ome people as low as he had found them when they fir&s;t attracted his notice. In the mean time he was removed from his employment; and Bolingbroke &s;eemed to triumph in the victory he had obtained. He layed his account with being admitted as chief mini&s;ter into the admini&s;tration of affairs; and is &s;aid to have formed the de&s;ign of a coalition with the duke of Marlborough, who at this very time embarked at O&s;tend for England. Probably, Oxford had tried to play the &s;ame game, but met with a repul&s;e from the duke, on account of the implacable re&s;entment which the dutche&s;s had conceived again&s;t that mini&s;ter.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="43" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>Whatever &s;chemes might have have been formed, the fall of the trea&s;urer was &s;o &s;udden, that no plan was e&s;tabli&s;hed for &s;upplying the vacancy occa&s;ioned by his di&s;grace. The confu&s;ion that ince&s;&s;antly en&s;ued at court, and the fatigue of attending a long cabinet-council on this event, had &s;uch an effect upon the queen's &s;pirits and con&s;titution, that &s;he declared &s;he &s;hould not outlive it, and was immediately &s;eized with a lethargic di&s;order. Notwith&s;tand|ing all the medicines which the phy&s;icians could pre&s;cribe, the di&s;temper gained ground &s;o fa&s;t, that next day, which was the thirtieth of July, they de&s;paired of her life. Then the committee of the council a&s;&s;embled at the Cockpit, ad|journed to Ken&s;ington. The dukes of Somer&s;et and Argyle, informed of the de&s;perate &s;ituation in which &s;he lay, repaired to the palace; and, without being &s;ummoned, entered the council-chamber. The members were &s;urpri&s;ed at their appearance; but the duke of Shrew&s;bury thanked them for their readine&s;s to
<PB N="425" REF="4280">
give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance at &s;uch a critical juncture; and de&s;ired they would take their places. The phy&s;icians having declared, that the queen was &s;till &s;en&s;ible, the council unanimou&s;ly agreed, to recommend the duke of Shrew&s;bury as the fitte&s;t per&s;on to fill the place of lord-trea&s;urer. When this opinion was intimated to the queen, &s;he &s;aid, they could not have recommended a per&s;on &s;he liked better than the duke of Shrew&s;bury. She delivered to him the white &s;taff, bidding him u&s;e it for the good of her people. He would have returned the lord-cham|berlain's &s;taff; but &s;he de&s;ired he would keep them both: &s;o that he was at one time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the three greate&s;t po&s;ts of the kingdom, under the titles of lord-trea&s;urer, lord-chamberlain, and lord-lieutenant of Ireland. No noble|man in England better de&s;erved &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of his &s;overeign's fa|vour. He was mode&s;t, liberal, di&s;intere&s;ted, and a warm friend to his country. Bolingbroke's ambition was defeated by the vigour which the dukes of Somer|&s;et and Argyle exerted on this occa&s;ion. They propo&s;ed, that all privy-coun|&s;ellors in or about London, &s;hould be invited to attend, without di&s;tinction of party. The motion was approved; and the lord Somers, with many other Whig members, repaired to Ken&s;ington. The council being thus reinforced, began to provide for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom. Orders were immediately di&s;patched to four regiments of hor&s;e and dragoons quartered in remote coun|ties, to march up to the neighbourhood of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. Seven of the ten Briti&s;h Battalions in the Netherlands, were directed to embark at O&s;tend for England, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition: an embargo was layed upon all &s;hipping; and directions given for equipping all the &s;hips of war that could be &s;oone&s;t in a condition for &s;ervice. They &s;ent a letter to the elector of Brun&s;|wick, &s;ignifying, that the phy&s;icians had de&s;paired of the queen's life; inform|ing him of the mea&s;ures they had taken; and de&s;iring he would, with all con|venient &s;peed, repair to Holland, where he &s;hould be attended by a Briti&s;h &s;qua|dron, to convey him to England, in ca&s;e of her maje&s;ty's decea&s;e. At the &s;ame time they di&s;patched in&s;tructions to the earl of Strafford, to de&s;ire the &s;tates-general would be ready to perform the guaranty of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The he|ralds at arms were kept in waiting, with a troop of hor&s;e-guards, to proclaim the new king as &s;oon as the throne &s;hould become vacant. Precautions were taken to &s;ecure the &s;ea-ports; to overawe the Jacobites in Scotland; and the command of the fleet was be&s;towed upon the earl of Berkeley.</P>

<P>The queen continued to doze in a lethargic in&s;en&s;ibility, with very &s;hort intervals, till the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t in the morning, when &s;he expired, in the fiftieth year of her age, and in the thirteenth of her reign. Anne Stuart, queen of Great Britain, was in her per&s;on of the middle &s;ize, well proportioned. Her hair was of a dark brown colour, her complexion ruddy, her features were regular, her countenance was rather round than oval, and her a&s;pect more comely than maje&s;tic. Her voice was clear and melodious, and her pre&s;ence engaging. Her capacity was naturally good, but not much cultivated by learning; nor did &s;he exhibit any marks of extraordinary genius, or per&s;onal ambition. She was certainly deficient in that vigour of mind by which a prince ought to pre&s;erve his independence, and avoid the &s;nares and fetters of &s;yco|phants and favourites: but, whatever her weakne&s;s in this particular might have been, the virtues of her heart were never called in que&s;tion. She was a
<PB N="426" REF="4290">
pattern of conjugal affection and fidelity, a tender mother, a warm friend, an indulgent mi&s;tre&s;s, a munificent patron, a mild and merciful prince, during who&s;e reign no &s;ubject's blood was &s;hed for trea&s;on. She was zealou&s;ly attached to the church of England from conviction rather than from prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, un|affectedly pious, ju&s;t, charitable, and compa&s;&s;ionate. She felt a mother's fond|ne&s;s for her people, by whom &s;he was univer&s;ally beloved with a warmth of af|fection which even the prejudice of party could not abate. In a word, if &s;he was not the greate&s;t, &s;he was certainly one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed &s;overeigns that ever &s;at upon the throne of England; and well de&s;erved the expre&s;&s;ive, though &s;imple epithet, of "The good queen Anne."</P>

<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to remind the reader of the &s;tate of party at this important juncture. The Jacobites had been fed with hopes of &s;eeing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion altered by the earl of Oxford. The&s;e hopes he had conveyed to them in a di&s;tant, undeterminate, and my&s;terious manner, without any other view than that of preventing them from taking violent mea&s;ures to embarra&s;s his admini&s;tration. At lea&s;t, if he actually entertained at one time any other de&s;ign, he had, long before his di&s;grace, layed it wholly a&s;ide, pro|bably from an apprehen&s;ion of the danger with which it mu&s;t have been at|tended; and &s;eemed bent upon making a merit of his zeal for the hou&s;e of Hanover: but his conduct was &s;o equivocal and un&s;teady, that he ruined him&s;elf in the opinion of one party, without acquiring the confidence of the other. The friends of the pretender derived fre&s;h hopes from the mini&s;try of Bolingbroke. Though he had never explained him&s;elf on this &s;ubject, he was &s;uppo&s;ed to favour the heir of blood, and known to be an implacable enemy to the Whigs, who were the mo&s;t zealous advocates for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. They promi&s;ed them&s;elves much from his affection, but more from his re|&s;entment; and they believed the majority of the Tories would join them on the &s;ame maxims. All Bolingbroke's &s;chemes of power were defeated by the promotion of the duke of Shrew&s;bury to the office of trea&s;urer; and all his hopes bla&s;ted by the death of the queen, on who&s;e per&s;onal favour he de|pended. The re&s;olute behaviour of the dukes of Somer&s;et and Argyle, to|gether with the diligence and activity of a council in which the Whig intere&s;t had gained the a&s;cendency, completed the confu&s;ion of the Tories, who found them&s;elves without a head, divided, di&s;tracted, and irre&s;olute. Upon recol|lection, they &s;aw nothing &s;o eligible as &s;ilence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e mea&s;ures which they could not oppo&s;e with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. They had no other objection to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hanover, but the fear of &s;eeing the Whig faction once more predominant: yet they were not without hope that their new &s;overeign, who was reputed a prince of &s;agacity and experience, would cultivate and conciliate the affection of the Tories, who were the land|holders and proprietors of the kingdom, rather than declare him&s;elf the head of a faction which leaned for &s;upport on tho&s;e who were enemies to the church and monarchy, on the bank and the monied-intere&s;t, rai&s;ed upon u&s;ury and maintained by corruption. In a word, the Whigs were elated and overbearing; the Tories aba&s;hed and humble; the Jacobites eager, impatient, and alarmed at a juncture which with re&s;pect to them was truly critical.</P>

<P>The queen had no &s;ooner re&s;igned her la&s;t breath, than the privy-council met, and the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the lord chancellor, and the Hanoverian re&s;ident Kreyenberg, produced the three in&s;truments in which the
<PB N="429" REF="4320" MS="Y">
elector of Brun&s;wick had nominated the per&s;ons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were the dukes of Shrew&s;bury, So|mer&s;et, Bolton, Devon&s;hire, Kent, Argyle, Montro&s;e, Roxburgh; the earls of Pomfret, Angle&s;ey, Carlile, Nottingham, Abingdon, $Scar|borough, Orford, lord vi&s;count Town&s;hend, the lords Hallifax and Cowper.</NOTE> to be added as lords ju&s;tices to the &s;even great officers of the realm. Orders were immediately i&s;&s;ued for proclaiming king George, in England, Scotland, and Ireland. The regency appointed the earl of Dor&s;et to carry to Hanover the intimation of his maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion, and attend him in his journey to England. They &s;ent the general officers in whom they could confide, to their re&s;pective po&s;ts; they reinforced the garri&s;on of Port&s;mouth; and appointed Mr. Addi&s;on their &s;ecretary; while Bolingbroke was obliged to &s;tand at the door of the council-chamber with his bag and papers, and underwent every &s;pecies of mortification. On the whole, king George a&s;cended the throne of Great Britain in the fifty-fifth year of his age, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition, tumult, or &s;ign of popular di&s;content; and the unprejudiced part of the nation was now fully per&s;uaded that no de&s;ign had ever been concerted by queen Anne and her mini&s;try in favour of the pretender. The mayor of Oxford received a letter, requiring him to proclaim the pretender. This being communicated to the vice-chancellor, a copy of it was immediately tran&s;mitted to Mr. &s;ecretary Bromley, member of parliament for the univer&s;ity; and the vice-chancellor offered a reward of one hundred pounds to any per&s;on who &s;hould di&s;cover the author. It was either the production of &s;ome lunatic, or a weak contrivance to fix an odium on that venerable body.</P>

<P>The parliament having a&s;&s;embled, pur&s;uant to the act which regulated the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the lord chancellor, on the fifth day of Augu&s;t, made a &s;peech to both hou&s;es in the name of the regency. He told them, that the privy-council, appointed by the elector of Brun&s;wick, had proclaimed that prince under the name of king George, as the lawful and rightful &s;overeign of the&s;e kingdoms; and that they had taken the nece&s;&s;ary care to maintain the public peace. He ob&s;erved, that the &s;everal branches of the public revenue were ex|pired by the demi&s;e of her late maje&s;ty; and recommended to the commons the making &s;uch provi&s;ion in that re&s;pect as might be requi&s;ite to &s;upport the honour and dignity of the crown. He likewi&s;e expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that they would not be wanting in any thing that might conduce to the e&s;tabli&s;hing and advancing of the public credit. Both hou&s;es immediately agreed to ad|dre&s;&s;es, containing the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of duty and affection to their new &s;overeign, who did not fail to return &s;uch an&s;wers as were very agreeable to the parliament of Great Britain. In the mean time, the lower hou&s;e prepared and pa&s;&s;ed a bill, granting to his maje&s;ty the &s;ame civil-li&s;t which the queen had en|joyed; with additional clau&s;es for the payment of arrears due to the troops of Hanover, which had been in the &s;ervice of Great Britain; and for a reward of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, to be payed by the trea&s;ury to any per&s;on who &s;hould apprehend the pretender in landing, or in attempting to land in any part of the Briti&s;h dominions. Mr. Craggs, who had been di&s;patched to Ha|nover before the queen died, returning on the thirteenth day of Augu&s;t, with letters from the king to the regency, they went to the hou&s;e of peers; and the chancellor, in another &s;peech to both hou&s;es, intimated his maje&s;ty's great &s;a|tisfaction in the loyalty and affection which his people had univer&s;ally expre&s;&s;ed at his acce&s;&s;ion. Other addre&s;&s;es were voted on this occa&s;ion. The commons

$word$ the b$ll for the civil-li&s;t, and one for making &s;ome alterations in an act for a &s;tate lottery, which received the royal a&s;&s;ent from the lords ju&s;tices. Then the parliament was prorogued.</P>

<P>Mr. Prior having notified the queen's death to the court of Ver&s;ailles, Lewis declared, that he would inviolably maintain the treaty of peace con|c$uded at Utrecht, particularly with relation to the &s;ettlement of the Briti&s;h crown in the hou&s;e of Hanover. The earl of Strafford having &s;ignified the &s;ame event to the &s;tates of Holland; and the re&s;ident of Hanover having pre&s;e$ted them with a letter, in which his ma&s;ter claimed the performance of their guaranty, they re&s;olved to perform their engagements, and congratulated h$$ el$ctoral hig$ne&s;s on his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of Great Britain. They invited him to pa&s;s through their dominions; and a&s;&s;ured him that his intere&s;ts $$re as dear to them as their own. The chevalier de St. George no &s;ooner re|ceived the news of the queen's death, than he po&s;ted to Ver&s;ailles, where he was given to un$$r&s;tand, that the king of France expected he &s;hould quit his territories immediately; and he was accordingly obliged to return to Lor|rain. By this time Mr. Murray had arrived in England from Hanover, with notice that the king had deferred his departure for &s;ome days. He brought orders to the r$gency to prepare a patent for creating the prince-royal, prince of Wales; and for removing lord Bolingbroke from his po&s;t of &s;ecretary. The &s;eals were taken from this mini&s;ter by the dukes of Shrew&s;bury and Somer&s;et, and lord Cowper, who at the &s;ame time &s;ealed up all the doors of his office.</P>

<P>King George having ve&s;ted the government of his German dominions in a council, headed by his brother prince Erne&s;t, &s;et out with the electoral prince from Herenhau&s;en on the thirty-fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t; and in five days arrived at the Hague$ where he conf$rred with the &s;tates-general. On the &s;ixteenth day of September he embarked at Orange-Polder, under convoy of an Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;quadron, commanded by the earl of Berkeley; and next day arrived at the Hope. In the afternoon the yacht &s;ailed up the river; and his maje&s;ty, with the prince, were landed from a barge at Greenwich, about &s;ix in the evening. There he was received by the duke of Northumberland, captain of the life|guard, and the lords of the regency. From the landing-place he walked to h$s h$u&s;e in the Park, accompanied by a great number of the nobility, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, who had the honour to ki&s;s his hand, as they ap|proached. When he retired to his bed-chamber, he &s;ent for tho&s;e of the no|bility who had d$&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their zeal for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: but the duke of Or$ond, the lord chancellor, and lord Trevor, were not of the num|ber. Next morning, the earl of Oxford pre&s;ented him&s;elf with an air of con|f$dence, as if he had expected to receive &s;ome particular mark of his maje&s;ty's favour. But he had the mortification to remain a con&s;iderable time undi&s;tin|gui&s;hed among the croud; and then was permitted to ki&s;s the king's hand, without being honoured with any other notice. On the other hand, his ma|je&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed uncommon regard for the duke of Marlborough, who had lately arrived in England, as well as for all the leaders of the Whig party.</P>

<P>It was the misfortune of this prince, as well as a very great prejudice to the nation, that he had been mi&s;led into &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Tories, who con&s;tituted &s;uch a con&s;iderable part of his &s;ubjects. They were now excluded from all &s;hare of the royal favour, which was wholly engro&s;&s;ed
<PB N="431" REF="4340">
by their enemies; and the&s;e early marks of aver&s;ion, which he was at no pains to conceal, alienated the minds of many from his per&s;on and government, who would otherwi&s;e have &s;erved him with fidelity and affection. An in&s;tan|taneous and total change was effected in all offices of honour and advantage. The duke of Ormond was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his command, which the king re|&s;tored to the duke of Marlborough, whom he likewi&s;e appointed colonel of the fir&s;t regiment of foot-guards, and ma&s;ter of the ordnance. The great &s;eal was given to lord Cowper; the privy-&s;eal to the earl of Wharton; the government of Ireland to the earl of Sunderland. The duke of Devon&s;hire was made &s;teward of the hou&s;hold; lord Town&s;hend and Mr. Stanhope were appointed &s;ecretaries of &s;tate: the po&s;t of &s;ecretary for Scotland was be&s;towed upon the duke of Montro&s;e. The duke of Somer&s;et was con&s;tituted ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e; the duke of St. Alban's captain of the band of pen&s;ioners; and the duke of Argyle commander in chief of the forces in Scotland. Mr. Pulteney became &s;ecretary at war; and Mr. Walpole, who had already undertaken to manage the hou&s;e of commons, was gratified with the double place of pay|ma&s;ter to the army and to Chel&s;ea-ho&s;pital. A new privy-council was ap|pointed, and the earl of Nottingham declared pre&s;ident: but all affairs of con&s;equence were concerted by a cabinet-council or junto, compo&s;ed of the duke of Marlborough, the earls of Nottingham and Sunderland, the lords Hallifax, Town&s;hend, Somers, and general Stanhope. The regency had already re|moved Sir Con&s;tantine Phipps and the archbi&s;hop of Armagh from the office of lords ju&s;tices in Ireland, and filled their places in the regency of that kingdom with the archbi&s;hop of Dublin and the earl of Kildare. Allan Broderick was appointed chancellor; another privy-council was formed, and the duke of Ormond was named as one of the members. The trea&s;ury and admiralty were put into commi&s;&s;ion; all the governments were changed; and, in a word, the whole nation was delivered into the hands of the Whigs. At the &s;ame time, the prince-royal was declared prince of Wales, and took his place in coun|cil. The king was congratulated on his acce&s;&s;ion in addre&s;&s;es from the two univer&s;ities, and all the cities and corporations of the kingdom. He expre&s;&s;ed particular &s;atisfaction at the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of loyalty and affection. He de|clared in council, his firm purpo&s;e to &s;upport and maintain the churches of England and Scotland as they were by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. This he was of opi|nion might be effectually done without impairing the toleration allowed by law to prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the trade and riches of the king|dom: and he moreover a&s;&s;ured them, he would earne&s;tly endeavour to render property &s;ecure; the good effects of which were no where &s;o clearly &s;een as in this happy nation. Before the coronation he created &s;ome new peers, and others were promoted to higher titles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James lord Chandois was created earl of Caernarvon; Lewis lord Rockingham, earl of that name; Charles lord O&s;&s;ulton, earl of Tan|kerville; Charles lord Hallifax, earl of Hallifax; Heneage lord Guern&s;ey, earl of Aylesford; John lord Hervey, earl of Bri&s;tol; Thomas lord Pel|ham, earl of Clare; and Henry earl of Tho|mond, in Ireland, vi&s;count Tadca&s;ter; James vi&s;count Ca&s;tleton in Ireland, baron S$nder&s;on; Bennet lord Sherard in Ireland, baron of Har|borough; Gerva&s;e lord Pierrepoint in Ireland, baron Pierrepoint in the county of Bucks; Henry Boyle, baron of Carleton, in the county of York; Sir Richard Temple, baron of Cobham; Henry Lord Paget, earl of Uxbridge.</NOTE>. On the twentieth day of October he was crowned in We&s;tmin&s;ter with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity, at which the earl of Oxford

and lord Bolingbroke a&s;&s;i&s;ted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the month of October$ the prince&s;s of Wales arrived in England, with her two elde&s;t daughters the prince&s;&s;es Anne and Amelia.</NOTE>. On that very day, the univer&s;ity of Oxford, in full convocation, unanimou&s;ly conferred the degree of doctor of civil law on Sir Con&s;tantine Phipps, with particular marks of honour and e&s;teem. As the French king was &s;aid to protract the demolition of Dunkirk, Mr. Prior re|ceived orders to pre&s;ent a memorial to ha&s;ten this work, and to prevent the canal of Mardyk$ from being fini&s;hed. The an&s;wer which he received being deemed equivocal, this mini&s;ter was recalled, and the earl of Stair appointed amba&s;&s;ador to the court of France, where he pro&s;ecuted this affair with un|common vigour. About the &s;ame time, general Cadogan was &s;ent as pleni|potentiary to Antwerp, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the barrier-treaty, there negotiated between the emperor and the &s;tates-general.</P>

<P>Mean while, the number of the malcontents in England was con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed by the king's attachment to the Whig faction. The cla|mour of the church's being in danger was revived: jealou&s;ies were excited, &s;editious libels di&s;per&s;ed; and dangerous tumults rai&s;ed in diferent parts of the kingdom. Birmingham, Bri&s;tol, Chippenham, Norwich, and Reading$ were filled with licentious riot. The party cry was, <Q>&startq;Down with the Whigs. Sacheverel for ever.&endq;</Q> Many gentlemen of the Whig faction were abu&s;ed; magi&s;trates in towns, and ju&s;tices in the country, were reviled and in&s;ulted by the populace in the execution of their office. The pretender took this oppor|tunity to tran&s;mit, by the French mail, copies of a printed manife&s;to, to the dukes of Shrew&s;bury, Marlborough, Argyle, and other noblemen of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction. In this declaration, he mentioned the good intentions of his &s;i&s;ter towards him, which were prevented by her deplorable death. He ob&s;erved, that his people, in&s;tead of doing him and them&s;elves ju&s;tice, had proclaimed for their king a foreign prince, contrary to the fundamental and inconte&s;table laws of hereditary right, which their pretended acts of &s;ettlement could never abrogate. The&s;e papers being delivered to the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, the king refu&s;ed an audience to the marquis de Lamberti, mini&s;ter from the duke of Lorrain, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that this manife&s;to could not have been prepared or tran&s;mitted without the knowledge and countenance of his ma&s;ter. The mar|quis having communicated this circum&s;tance to the duke, that prince ab&s;olutely denied his having been privy to the tran&s;action, and declared that the chevalier de St. George came into Lorrain by the directions of the French king, whom the duke could not di&s;oblige without expo&s;ing his territories to inva&s;ion. Notwith|&s;tanding this apology, the marquis was given to under&s;tand, that he could not be admitted to an audience until the pretender &s;hould be removed from the do|minions of his ma&s;ter; he therefore quitted the kingdom without further he&s;i|tation. Religion was &s;till mingled in all political di&s;putes. The high-church|men complained that impiety and here&s;y daily gained ground, from the con|nivance, or at lea&s;t the &s;upine negligence, of the Whig prelates. The lower hou&s;e of convocation had, before the queen's death, declared that a book pu|bli&s;hed by Dr. Samuel Clarke, under the title of <Q>&startq;The &s;cripture-doctrine of the Trinity,&endq;</Q> contained a&s;&s;ertions contrary to the catholic faith. They &s;ent up extracts from this performance to the bi&s;hops; and the doctor wrote an
<PB N="433" REF="4360">
an&s;wer to their objections. He was prevailed upon to write an apology, which he pre&s;ented to the upper hou&s;e; but apprehending it might be publi&s;hed &s;e|parately, and mi&s;under&s;tood, he afterwards delivered an explanation to the bi&s;hop of London. This was &s;atisfactory to the bi&s;hops; but the lower hou&s;e re&s;olved, that it was no recantation of his heretical a&s;&s;ertions. The di&s;putes about the Trinity increa&s;ing, the archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops received directions, which were publi&s;hed, for pre&s;erving unity in the church, the purity of the chri&s;tian faith concerning the holy Trinity; and for maintaining the peace and quiet of the &s;tate. By the&s;e every preacher was re&s;tricted from delivering any other doctrine than what is contained in the holy &s;criptures with re&s;pect to the Trinity; and from intermeddling in any affairs of &s;tate or government. The like prohibi|tion was extended to tho&s;e who &s;hould write, harrangue, or di&s;pute, on the &s;ame &s;ubjects.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The parliament being di&s;&s;olved, another was called by a very ex|traordinary proclamation, in which the king complained of the evil de&s;igns of men di&s;affected to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and of their having mi&s;repre&s;ented his con|duct and principles. He mentioned the perplexity of public affairs, the in|terruption of commerce, and the heavy debts of the nation. He expre&s;&s;ed his hope that his loving &s;ubjects would &s;end up to parliament the fitte&s;t per&s;ons to redre&s;s the pre&s;ent di&s;orders; and that, in the elections, they would have a particular regard to &s;uch as had expre&s;&s;ed a firm attachment to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion when it was in danger. It does not appear that the prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion was ever in danger. How then was this declaration to be interpreted? People in general con&s;trued it into a de&s;ign to maintain party-di&s;tinctions, and encourage the Whigs to the full exertion of their influence in the elections; into a renunciation of the Tories$ and the fir&s;t fla&s;h of that vengeance which afterwards was &s;een to bur&s;t upon the heads of the late mini&s;try. When the earl of Strafford returned from Holland, all his papers were &s;eized by an order from the &s;ecretary's office. Mr. Prior was recalled from France, and promi&s;ed to di&s;cover all he knew relating to the conduct of Oxford's admini&s;tration. Uncommon vigour was exerted on both &s;ides in the elections; but, by dint of the monied-intere&s;t, which prevailed in mo&s;t of the corporations through the kingdom, and the countenance of the mini&s;try, which will always have weight with needy and venal electors, a great majority of Whigs was returned both in England and Scotland.</P>

<P>When this new parliament a&s;&s;embled on the &s;eventeenth day of March at We&s;tmin&s;ter, Mr. Spencer Compton was cho&s;en &s;peaker of the commons. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of the month, the king appeared in the hou&s;e of lords, and delivered to the chancellor a written &s;peech, which was read in pre&s;ence of both hou&s;es. His maje&s;ty thanked his faithful and loving &s;ubjects for that zeal and firmne&s;s they had &s;hewn in defence of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, again&s;t all the open and &s;ecret practices which had been u&s;ed to defeat it. He told them, that &s;ome conditions of the peace, e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity and trade of Great Britain, were not yet duly executed; and that the performance of the whole might be looked upon as precarious, until defen&s;ive alliances &s;hould be formed to guaranty the pre&s;ent treaties. He ob&s;erved, that the pretender boa&s;ted of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he expected in England, to repair his former di&s;ap|pointments: that great part of the national trade was rendered impracticable:
<PB N="434" REF="4370">
that the public debts were &s;urpri&s;ingly increa&s;ed, even &s;ince the fatal ce&s;&s;ation of arms. He gave the commons to under&s;tand, that the branches of the re|venue formerly granted for the &s;upport of the civil government, were &s;o far encumbered and alienated, that the produce of the funds which remained, and had been granted to him, would fall &s;hort of what was at fir&s;t de&s;igned for maintaining the honour and dignity of the crown: that as it was his and $span$ to &s;ee a prince of Wales who might in due time &s;ucceed him on the $word$ and to &s;ee him ble&s;&s;ed with many children; the&s;e circum&s;tances would naturally occa&s;ion an expence to which the nation had not been for many years accu&s;tomed; and therefore he did not doubt but they would think of it with that affection which he had rea&s;on to hope from his commons. He de&s;ired that no unhappy divi&s;ions of parties might divert them from pur&s;uing the common intere&s;t of their country. He declared that the e&s;tabli&s;hed con|$$$tution in church and &s;tate &s;hould be the rule of his government; and that the happine&s;s, ea&s;e, and pro&s;perity, of his people, &s;hould be the chief care of his life. He concluded with expre&s;&s;ing his confidence, that with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he &s;hould di&s;appoint the de&s;igns of tho&s;e who would deprive him of that ble&s;|&s;ing which he mo&s;t valued, the affection of his people.</P>

<P>Speeches, &s;ugge&s;ted by a vindictive mini&s;try, better became the leader of an incen&s;ed party, than the father and &s;overeign of a divided people. This portended mea&s;ures which it was the intere&s;t of the crown to avoid, and &s;uited the temper of the majority in both hou&s;es, which breathed nothing but de&s;truction to their political adver&s;aries. The lords, in their addre&s;s of thanks, profe&s;&s;ed their hope that his maje&s;ty, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the parliament, would be able to recover the reputation of the kingdom in foreign parts, the lo&s;s of which they hoped to convince the world by their actions, was by no means to be imputed to the nation in general. The Tories &s;aid this was an invidious reflec|tion, calculated to mi&s;lead and inflame the people; for the reputation of the kingdom had never been &s;o high as at this very juncture. The commons pre|tended a&s;toni&s;hment to find that any conditions of the late peace &s;hould not yet be duly executed; and that care was not taken to form &s;uch alliances as might have rendered the peace not precarious. They declared their re&s;olution to inquire into the&s;e fatal mi&s;carriages; to trace out tho&s;e mea&s;ures whereon the pretender placed his hopes, and bring the authors of them to condign puni&s;h|ment. The&s;e addre&s;&s;es were not voted without oppo&s;ition. In the hou&s;e of lords, the dukes of Buckingham and Shrew&s;bury, the earl of Angle&s;ey, the archbi&s;hop of York, and other peers both &s;ecular and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, ob&s;erved, that their addre&s;s was injurious to the late queen's memory, and would &s;erve only to increa&s;e tho&s;e unhappy divi&s;ions that di&s;tracted the kingdom. In the lower hou&s;e, Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Bromley, Mr. Shippen, general Ro&s;s, Sir Wyndham Whitelock, and other members, took exceptions to pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ame nature, in the addre&s;s which the commons had prepared. They were an&s;wered by Mr. Walpole, Mr. Pulteney, and Mr. &s;ecretary Stanhope, who took occa&s;ion to declare, that notwith&s;tanding the endeavours which had been u&s;ed to prevent a di&s;covery of the late mi&s;managements, by conveying away &s;everal papers from the &s;ecretary's office; yet the government had &s;ufficient evidence left, to prove the late mini&s;try the mo&s;t corrupt that ever &s;at at the helm: that tho&s;e matters would &s;oon be layed before the hou&s;e, when it would

appear, that a certain Engli&s;h general had acted in concert with, if not re|ceived orders from, marechal de Villars. Lord Bolingbroke, who had hitherto appeared in public, as u&s;ual, with great &s;erenity, and &s;poke in the hou&s;e of lords with great freedom and confidence, thought it was now high time to con|&s;ult<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boyer. Torcy. Tindal. Bolingbroke. Voltaire.</NOTE> his per&s;onal &s;afety. He accordingly withdrew to the continent, leaving a letter which was afterwards printed in his ju&s;tification. In this paper he de|clared he had received certain and repeated informations that a re&s;olution was taken to pur&s;ue him to the &s;caffold: that if there had been the lea&s;t rea&s;on to hope for a fair and open trial, after having been already prejudged unheard, by the two hou&s;es of parliament, he &s;hould not have declined the &s;tricte&s;t ex|amination. He challenged the mo&s;t inveterate of his enemies to produce any one in&s;tance of criminal corre&s;pondence, or the lea&s;t corruption in any part of the admini&s;tration in which he was concerned. He &s;aid, if his zeal for the honour and dignity of his royal mi&s;tre&s;s, and the true intere&s;t of his country, had any where tran&s;ported him to let &s;lip a warm and unguarded expre&s;&s;ion, he hoped the mo&s;t favourable interpretation would be put upon it. He affirmed that he had &s;erved her maje&s;ty faithfully and dutifully, in that e&s;pecially which &s;he had mo&s;t at heart, relieving her people from a bloody and expen|&s;ive war; and that he had always been too much an Engli&s;hman to &s;acrifice the intere&s;t of his country to any foreign ally what&s;oever.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1715.</NOTE> In the mid&s;t of all this violence again&s;t the late mini&s;ters, friends were not wanting to e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e in the face of oppo&s;ition; and even in &s;ome addre&s;&s;es to the king, their conduct was ju&s;tified. Nay, &s;ome individuals had courage enough to attack the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. When a motion was made in the hou&s;e of commons, to con&s;ider the king's proclamation for calling a new parliament, Sir William Whitelocke, member for the univer&s;ity of Oxford, boldly declared it was unprecedented and unwarrantable. Being called upon to explain him&s;elf, he made an apology. Neverthele&s;s, Sir William ri&s;ing up, &s;aid the proclamation was not only unprecedented and unwarrantable, but even of dangerous con&s;equence to the very being of parliaments. When challenged to ju&s;tify his charge, he ob&s;erved, that every member was free to &s;peak his thoughts. Some exclaimed, "The Tower, the Tower." A warm debate en&s;ued: Sir William being ordered to withdraw, was accompanied by one hundred and twenty-nine members; and, tho&s;e who remained in the hou&s;e re&s;olved, That he &s;hould be reprimanded by the &s;peaker. He was accordingly re|buked for having pre&s;umed to reflect on his maje&s;ty's proclamation; and made an unwarrantable u&s;e of the freedom of &s;peech granted by his maje&s;ty. Sir William &s;aid, he was not con&s;cious of having offered any indignity to his maje&s;ty, or of having been guilty of a breach of privilege: that he acquie&s;ced in the deter|mination of the hou&s;e; but had no thanks to give to tho&s;e gentlemen, who, under pretence of lenity, had &s;ubjected him to this cen&s;ure.</P>

<P>On the ninth day of April general Stanhope delivered to the hou&s;e of commons fourteen volumes, con&s;i&s;ting of all the papers relating to the late nego|tiations of peace and commerce, as well as to the ce&s;&s;ation of arms; and moved, that they might be referred to a &s;elect committee of twenty per&s;ons, who &s;hould di|ge&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance of them under proper heads, and report them, with their ob&s;erva|tions, to the hou&s;e. One more was added to the number of this &s;ecret committee, which was cho&s;en by ballot; and met that &s;ame evening. Robert Walpole,
<PB N="436" REF="4390">
original chairman, being taken ill, was &s;ucceeded in that place by Mr. Stan|hope. The whole number was &s;ubdivided into three committees: to each a certain number of books was allotted; and they carried on the inquiry with great eagerne&s;s and expedition. Before this mea&s;ure was taken Dr. Gilbert Burnet bi&s;hop of Sarum died of a pleuritic fever, in the &s;eventy-&s;econd year of his age; and immediately after the committee had begun to act, the Whig party lo&s;t one of their warme&s;t champions, by the death of the marquis of Wharton, a nobleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of happy talents for the cabinet, the &s;enate, and the com|mon &s;cenes of life; talents, which a life of plea&s;ure and libertini&s;m did not pre|vent him from employing with &s;urpri&s;ing vigour and application. The com|mittee of the lower hou&s;e taking the civil li&s;t into con&s;ideration, examined &s;everal papers relating to that revenue. The Tories ob&s;erved, that from the &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds granted annually to king William, the &s;um of fifty thou&s;and pounds was allotted to the late queen when prince&s;s of Denmark; twenty thou&s;and pounds to the duke of Glouce&s;te$$ and twice that &s;um as a dowry to James's queen: that near two hundred thou&s;and pounds had been yearly deducted from the revenues of the late queen's civil li&s;t, and applied to other u&s;es; notwith&s;tanding which deduction, &s;he had honourably maintained her family, and &s;upported the dignity of the crown. In the cour&s;e of the debate &s;ome warm altercation pa&s;&s;ed between lord Guern&s;ey and one of the mem|bers, who affirmed, that the late mini&s;try had u&s;ed the Whigs, and, indeed, the whole nation, in &s;uch a manner, that nothing they &s;hould &s;uffer could be deemed a hard&s;hip. At length, the hou&s;e agreed, that the &s;um of &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds clear &s;hould be granted for the civil-li&s;t during his maje&s;ty's life. A motion being made for an addre&s;s again&s;t pen&s;ions, it was oppo&s;ed by Mr. Walpole, and over-ruled by the majority: and the lords pa&s;&s;ed the bill for regulating the land-forces, with &s;ome amendments.</P>

<P>On the eighteenth day of May Sir John Norris &s;ailed with a &s;trong &s;quadron to the Baltic, in order to protect the commerce of the nation, which had &s;uffered from the king of Sweden, who cau&s;ed all &s;hips trading to tho&s;e parts to be &s;eized and con&s;i&s;cated. That prince had rejected the treaty of neutrality concerted by the allies for the &s;ecurity of the empire; and con&s;idered the Engli&s;h and Dutch as his enemies. The mini&s;ters of England and the &s;tates-general had pre&s;ented memorials to the regency of Sweden; but finding no redre&s;s, they re&s;olved to protect their trade by force of arms. After the Swedi&s;h gene|ral Steenbock and his army were made pri&s;oners, count Wellen concluded a treaty with the admini&s;trator of Hol&s;tein-Gottorp, by which the towns of Stetin and Wi&s;mar were &s;eque&s;tered into the hands of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; and the admini&s;trator engaged to &s;ecure them and all the re&s;t of Swedi&s;h Pomerania, from the Poles and Mu&s;covites; but, as the governor of $om$r$nia refu&s;ed to comply with this treaty, tho&s;e allies marched into the province, &s;ubdued the i&s;land of Rugen, and obliged Stetin to &s;urrender. Then the governor con&s;ented to the &s;eque&s;tration, and payed to the Poles and Mu&s;covites four hundred thou|&s;and $ix-dollars, to indemnity them for the expence of the &s;$$g$. The king of Sweden returning from Turkey, rejected the treaty of &s;$qu$&s;tr$tion, and in&s;i&s;ted upon Stetin's being re&s;tored, without his repaying the money. As this monarch $word$ threatened to invade the electorate of Saxony, and c$$&s;$i&s;e his fal&s;e friend's king George, for the &s;ecurity of his German dominions, concluded a
<PB N="437" REF="4400">
treaty with the king of Denmark; by which the dutchies of Bremen and Verden, which had been taken from the Swede in his ab&s;ence, were made over to his Britannic maje&s;ty, on condition that he &s;hould immediately declare war again&s;t Sweden. Accordingly he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the dutchies in October; pub|li&s;hed a declaration of war again&s;t Charles in his German dominions; and de|tached &s;ix thou&s;and Hanoverians to join the Danes and Pru&s;&s;ians in Pomera|nia. The&s;e allies reduced the i&s;lands of Rugen and Uledon, and attacked the towns of Wi&s;mar and Stral&s;und, from which la&s;t place Charles was obliged to retire in a ve&s;&s;el to Schonen. He a&s;&s;embled a body of troops, with which he propo&s;ed to pa&s;s the Sound upon the ice, and attack Copenhagen; but was di&s;|appointed by a &s;udden thaw. Neverthele&s;s, he refu&s;ed to return to Stockholm, which he had not &s;een for &s;ixteen years; but remained at Carle&s;croon, in order to ha&s;ten his fleet for the relief of Wi&s;mar.</P>

<P>The &s;pirit of di&s;content and di&s;affection &s;eemed to gain ground every day in England. Notwith&s;tanding proclamations again&s;t riots, and orders of the ju&s;tices for maintaining the peace, repeated tumults were rai&s;ed by the mal|contents in the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. Tho&s;e who celebrated the anniver&s;ary of the king's birth-day with the u&s;ual marks of joy and fe&s;tivity, were in&s;ulted by the populace; but, next day, which was the anniver&s;ary of the re&s;toration, the whole city was lighted up with bonfires and illuminations, and ecchoed with the &s;ound of mirth and tumultuous rejoicing. The people even obliged the life-guards who patroled through the &s;treets, to join in the cry of "High church and Ormond!" and in Smithfield they burned a picture of king William. Thirty per&s;ons were impri&s;oned for being concerned in the&s;e riots. One Bournois, a &s;choolma&s;ter, who affirmed that king George had no right to the crown, was tried and &s;courged through the city, with &s;uch &s;everity, that in a few days he expired in the utmo&s;t torture. A frivolous incident &s;erved to increa&s;e the popular ferment. The &s;hirts allowed to the fir&s;t regiment of guards, com|manded by the duke of Marlborough, were &s;o coar&s;e, that the &s;oldiers could hardly be per&s;uaded to wear them. Some were thrown into the king's and duke of Marlborough's gardens. A detachment, in marching through the city, produced them to the view of the &s;hopkeepers and pa&s;&s;engers, exclaiming, "The&s;e are the Hanover &s;hirts." The court being informed of this clamour, ordered tho&s;e new &s;hirts to be burned immediately; but even this &s;acrifice, and an adverti&s;ement publi&s;hed by the duke of Marlborough in his own vindication, did not acquit that general of a &s;u&s;picion that he was concerned in this mean &s;pecies of peculation. A reward of fifty pounds was offered by the govern|ment to any per&s;on that would di&s;cover one captain Wight, who, by an inter|cepted letter, appeared to be di&s;affected to king George; and Mr. George Jeffries was &s;eized at Dublin with a packet directed to Dr. Jonathan Swift, dean of St. Patrick's. Several trea&s;onable papers being found in this packet, were tran&s;mitted to England: Jeffries was obliged to give bail for his appear|ance; and Swift thought proper to ab&s;cond.</P>

On the ninth day of June, Mr.
<PB N="438" REF="4410">
Walpole, as chairman of the &s;ecret committee, declared to the hou&s;e of commons, that the report was ready; and in the mean time moved, That a warrant might be i&s;&s;ued by Mr. Speaker for apprehending &s;everal per&s;ons, particularly Mr. Matthew Prior and Mr. Thomas Harley, who being in the hou&s;e, were imme|diately taken into cu&s;tody. Then he read the report, ranged under the&s;e diffe|rent heads: the clande&s;tine negotiation with mon&s;ieur Menager: the extraordi|nary mea&s;ures pur&s;ued to form the congre&s;s at Utrecht: the trifling of the French plenipotentiaries, by the connivance of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters: the nego|tiation about the renunciation of the Spani&s;h monarchy: the fatal &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms: the &s;eizure of Ghent and Bruges, in order to di&s;tre&s;s the allies and favour the French: the duke of Ormond's acting in concert with the French general: the lord Bolingbroke's journey to France to negotiate a &s;eparate peace: Mr. Prior's and the duke of Shrew&s;bury's negotiations in France: the precipitate conclu&s;ion of the peace at Utrecht. The report being recited, Sir Thomas Hanmer moved, That the con&s;ideration of it &s;hould be adjourned to a certain day: and, that in the mean time the report &s;hould be pre&s;ented for the peru&s;al of the members: he was &s;econded by the Tories; a debate en&s;ued; and the motion was rejected by a great majority.</P>

<P>This point being gained, Mr. Walpole impeached Henry lord vi&s;|count Bolingbroke of high-trea&s;on, and other high crimes and mi&s;demeanours. Mr. Hungerford declared his opinion, that nothing mentioned in the report, in relation to lord Bolingbroke, amounted to high-trea&s;on; and general Ro&s;s expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame &s;entiment. Then lord Coning&s;by &s;tanding up, <Q>&startq;The wor|thy chairman &s;aid he has impeached the hand, but I impeach the head: he has impeached the clerk, and I, the ju&s;tice: he has impeached the &s;cholar, and I, the ma&s;ter. I impeach Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, of high-trea&s;on, and other crimes and mi&s;demeanours.&endq;</Q> Mr. auditor Harley, the earl's brother, &s;poke in vindication of that mini&s;ter. He affirmed he had done nothing but by the immediate command of his &s;overeign: that the peace was a good peace, and approved as &s;uch by two parliaments: and, that the facts charged to him in the report, amounted only to mi&s;demeanours. Mr. au|ditor Foley, the earl's brother-in-law, made a &s;peech to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll, a &s;taunch Whig, and member of the &s;ecret committee, expre&s;&s;ed his doubt, whether they had &s;ufficient matter or evidence to impeach the earl of high-trea&s;on. Neverthele&s;s, the hou&s;e re&s;olved to impeach him, without a divi&s;ion. When he appeared in the hou&s;e of lords next day, he found him&s;elf avoided by his brother peers, as infectious; and retired with &s;igns of confu&s;ion. Prior and Harley having been examined by &s;uch of the committee as were ju&s;|tices of the peace for Middle&s;ex, Mr. Walpole informed the hou&s;e, that mat|ters of &s;uch importance appeared in Prior's examination, that he was directed to move them for that member's being clo&s;ely confined. He was accordingly cut off from all communication. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of June Mr. &s;ecretary Stanhope impeached James duke of Ormond of high-trea&s;on, and other high crimes and mi&s;demeanours. Mr. Archibald Hutchin&s;on, one of the commi&s;|&s;ioners of trade, &s;poke in favour of the duke. He expatiated on his noble birth and qualifications: he enumerated the great &s;ervices performed to the crown and nation by his grace and his ance&s;tors: he ob&s;erved, that in the whole cour&s;e of his late conduct, he had only obeyed the queen's commands; and affirmed, that all
<PB N="439" REF="4420">
the allegations again&s;t him, could not, in the rigour of the law, be con&s;trued into high trea&s;on. Mr. Hutchin&s;on was &s;econded by general Lumley, who urged, that the duke of Ormond had on all occa&s;ions given &s;ignal proofs of his affection for his country, as well as of per&s;onal courage: that he had gene|rou&s;ly expended the be&s;t part of his e&s;tate by living abroad in a mo&s;t noble and &s;plendid manner, for the honour of his country. Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll &s;aid, if there was room for mercy, he hoped it would be &s;hewn to that noble, generous, and courageous peer, who had in a cour&s;e of many years exerted tho&s;e great accom|pli&s;hments for the good and honour of his country: that, as the &s;tatute of Ed|ward III. on which the charge of high-trea&s;on again&s;t him was to be grounded, had been mitigated by &s;ub&s;equent acts, the hou&s;e ought not, in his opinion, to take advantage of that act again&s;t the duke, but only impeach him of high crimes and mi&s;demeanours. General Ro&s;s, Sir William Wyndham, and the &s;peakers of that party, did not abandon the duke in this emergency; but, all their arguments and eloquence were lo&s;t upon the other faction, by which they were greatly outnumbered; and the que&s;tion being put, was carried for the im|peachment of the duke of Ormond, who perceiving every thing conducted by a furious &s;pirit of revenge, and that he could not expect the benefit of an im|partial trial, con&s;ulted his own &s;afety by withdrawing him&s;elf from the king|dom. On the twenty-&s;econd day of June the earl of Strafford was likewi&s;e im|peached by Mr. Ai&s;laby, for having advi&s;ed the fatal &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms, and the &s;eizing of Ghent and Bruges; and for having treated the mo&s;t &s;erene hou&s;e of Hanover with in&s;olence and contempt. He was al&s;o defended by his friends, but overpowered by his enemies.</P>

<P>When the articles again&s;t the earl of Oxford were read in the hou&s;e, a warm debate aro&s;e upon the eleventh, by which he was charged with having advi&s;ed the French king in what manner Tournay might be gained from the &s;tates general. The que&s;tion being put, Whether this article amounted to high-trea&s;on? Sir Robert Raymond, formerly &s;ollicitor-general, maintained the ne|gative, and was &s;upported not only by Sir William Wyndham and the Tories, but al&s;o by Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll, who &s;aid, it was ever his principle to do ju&s;tice to every body from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t; and, that it was the duty of an ho|ne&s;t man never to act by a &s;pirit of party: that he hoped he might pretend to have &s;ome knowledge of the laws of the kingdom; and would not &s;cruple to declare, that in his judgment, the charge in que&s;tion did not amount to high-trea&s;on. Mr. Walpole an&s;wered with great warmth, that there were &s;everal per&s;ons both in and out of the committee, who did not in the lea&s;t yield to that member in point of hone&s;ty; and who were &s;uperior to him in the knowledge of the laws, yet were &s;atisfied, that the charge &s;pecified in the eleventh article amounted to high-trea&s;on. This point being decided again&s;t the earl, and the other articles ap|proved by the hou&s;e, the lord Coning&s;by, attended by the Whig members, im|peached the earl of Oxford at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords, demanding, at the &s;ame time, that he might be &s;eque&s;tered from parliament, and committed to &s;afe cu&s;tody. A motion was made, that the con&s;ideration of the articles might be adjourned. After a &s;hort debate the articles were read: then the Tory lords moved, that the judges might be con&s;ulted. This motion being rejected, an|other was made, that the earl &s;hould be committed to &s;afe cu&s;tody: this occa|&s;ioned another debate, in which he him&s;elf &s;poke to the following purpo&s;e:
<PB N="440" REF="4430">
That the whole charge might be reduced to the negotiations and conclu&s;ion of the peace: that the nation wanted a peace, he &s;aid, no body would deny: that the conditions of this peace were as good as could be expected, confidering the backwardne&s;s and reluctancy which &s;ome of the allies &s;hewed to come into the queen's mea&s;ures: that the peace was approved by two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive parliaments: that he had no &s;hare in the affair of Tournay, which was wholly tran&s;acted by that unfortunate nobleman who had thought fit to &s;tep a&s;ide: that, for his own part, he always acted by the immediate directions and commands of the late queen, without offending again&s;t any known law; and being ju&s;tified by his own con&s;cience, was unconcerned for the life of an in&s;ignificant old man: that, if mi|ni&s;ters of &s;tate, acting by the immediate commands of their &s;overeign, are afterwards to be made accountable for their proceedings, it might one day or other be the ca&s;e with all the members of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly: that he did not doubt their lord&s;hips, out of regard to them&s;elves, would give him an equi|table hearing: and, that in the pro&s;ecution of the inquiry it would appear, he had merited not only the indulgence, but even the favour-of this government. <Q>&startq;My lords (&s;aid he) I am now to take my leave of your lord&s;hips, and of this honourable hou&s;e, perhaps for ever. I &s;hall lay down my life with plea&s;ure in a cau&s;e favoured by my late dear royal mi&s;tre&s;s. When I con&s;ider that I am to be judged by the ju&s;tice, honour, and virtue of my peers, I &s;hall ac|quie&s;ce, and retire with great content: and, my lords, God's will be done.&endq;</Q> The duke of Shrew&s;bury having acquainted the hou&s;e, that the earl was very much indi&s;po&s;ed with the gravel, he was &s;uffered to remain at his own hou&s;e, in cu&s;tody of the black-rod: in his way thither he was attended by a great multitude of people, crying, "High-church, Ormond, and Oxford for ever!" Next day he was brought to the bar, where he received a copy of the articles, and was allowed a month to prepare his an&s;wer. Though Dr. Mead declared, that if the earl &s;hould be &s;ent to the Tower his life would be in danger; it was carried, on a divi&s;ion, that he &s;hould be conveyed thither on the &s;ixteenth day of July. During the debate the earl of Angle&s;ey ob&s;erved, that the&s;e impeach|ments were di&s;agreeable to the nation; and that it was to be feared, &s;uch vio|lent mea&s;ures would make the &s;ceptre &s;hake in the king's hands. This expre&s;|&s;ion threw the whole hou&s;e in a flame. Some members cried, "To the Tower." Some, "To order." The earl of Sutherland declared, that if the&s;e words had been &s;poken in another place, he would have called the per&s;on that &s;poke them to an account: in the mean time he moved, that he &s;hould explain him&s;elf. Angle&s;ey, dreading the re&s;entment of the hou&s;e, was glad to make an apo|logy; which was accepted. The earl of Oxford was attended to the Tower by a prodigious concour&s;e of people, who did not &s;cruple to exclaim again&s;t his per&s;ecutors. Tumults were rai&s;ed in Stafford&s;hire and other parts of the king|dom, again&s;t the Whig party, which had depre&s;&s;ed the friends of the church and embroiled the nation. The hou&s;e of commons pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring that the laws might be vigorou&s;ly executed again&s;t the rioters. They prepared the proclamation-act, decreeing, that if any per&s;ons to the num|ber of twelve, unlawfully a&s;&s;embled, &s;hould continue together one hour after having been required to di&s;per&s;e, by a ju&s;tice of peace or other officer, and heard the proclamation again&s;t riots read in public, they &s;hould be deemed guilty of felony without benefit of the clergy.</P>

<P>When the king went to the hou&s;e of peers on the twentieth day of July, to give the royal a&s;&s;ent to this and &s;ome other bills, he told both hou&s;es, that a rebellion was actually begun at home; and, that the nation was threatened with an inva&s;ion from abroad. He therefore expected, that the commons would not leave the kingdom in a defencele&s;s condition, but enable him to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;afety. Addre&s;&s;es in the u&s;ual &s;tile were immediately pre&s;ented by the parliament, the convocation, the common-council, and lieutenancy of London, and the two univer&s;ities, though that of Oxford, was received in the mo&s;t contemptuous manner, the deputies being charged with di&s;loyalty, on account of a fray which had happened be|tween &s;ome recruiting officers and the &s;cholars of the univer&s;ity. The addre&s;&s;es from the kirk of Scotland, and the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters of London and We&s;tmin|&s;ter, met with a much more gracious reception. The parliament forthwith pa&s;&s;ed an act, impowering the king to &s;ecure &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, and to &s;u&s;pend the Habeas-corpus act in that time of danger. A clau&s;e was added to a money|bill, offering the reward of one hundred thou&s;and pounds to &s;uch as &s;hould &s;eize the pretender dead or alive. Sir George Byng was &s;ent to take the com|mand of the &s;leet: general Erle repaired to his government of Port&s;mouth: the guards were encamped in Hyde-park: lord Irwin was appointed governor of Hull, in the room of brigadier Sutton, who, with lord Wind&s;or, the gene|rals Ro&s;s, Webb, and Stuart, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice. Orders were given for rai&s;ing thirteen regiments of dragoons, and eight of infantry; and the trained-bands were kept in readine&s;s to &s;uppre&s;s tumults. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions the commons added &s;ix articles to tho&s;e exhibited again&s;t the earl of Oxford. Lord Bolingbroke was impeached at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords by Mr. Walpole: bills being brought in to &s;ummon him and the duke of Ormond, to &s;urrender them&s;elves by the tenth of September, or in default thereof, to attaint them of high trea&s;on; they pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent. On the la&s;t day of Augu&s;t the commons agreed to the articles again&s;t the earl of Strafford, which being pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e of lords, the earl made a &s;peech in his own vindication. He complained, that his papers had been &s;eized in an unprecedented manner. He &s;aid, if he had in his letters or di&s;cour&s;e, dropped any unguarded expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t &s;ome foreign mini&s;ters, while he had the honour to repre&s;ent the crown of Great Britain, he hoped they would not be accounted criminal by a Briti&s;h hou&s;e of peers: he de&s;ired he might be allowed a competent time to an&s;wer the articles brought again&s;t him, and have duplicates of all the papers which had either been layed before the committee of &s;ecrecy, or remained in the hands of the government, to be u&s;ed occa&s;ionally in his ju&s;tification. This reque&s;t was vehemently oppo&s;ed by the leaders of the other party, until the earl of Ilay repre&s;ented, that in all civilized nations, all courts of judicature, except the inqui&s;ition, allowed the per&s;ons arraigned all that was nece&s;&s;ary for their ju&s;tification: and, that the hou&s;e of peers of Great-Britain ought not, in this ca&s;e, to do any thing contrary to that honour and equity for which they were &s;o ju&s;tly renowned throughout all Fu|rope. This ob&s;ervation made an impre&s;&s;ion upon the hou&s;e, which re&s;olved, that the earl &s;hould be indulged with copies of &s;uch papers as he might have occa&s;ion to u&s;e in his defence.</P>

<P>On the third day of September Oxford's an&s;wer was delivered to the hou&s;e of lords, who tran&s;mitted it to the commons. Mr. Walpole having
<PB N="442" REF="4450">
heard it read$ &s;aid, it contained little more than a repetition of what had been &s;ugge&s;ted in &s;ome pamphlets and papers which had been publi&s;hed in vindica|tion of the late mini&s;try: that it was a fal&s;e and malicious libel, laying upon his royal mi&s;tre&s;s the blame of all the pernicious mea&s;ures he had led her into, again&s;t her own honour, and the good of his country: that it was likewi&s;e a libel on the proceedings of the commons, &s;ince he endeavoured to clear tho&s;e per&s;ons who had already confe&s;&s;ed their guilt by flight. After &s;ome debate the hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the an&s;wer of Robert earl of Oxford &s;hould be referred to the committee appointed to draw up articles of impeachment, and prepare evidence again&s;t the impeached lords: and, That the committee &s;hould prepare a replication to the an&s;wer. This was accordingly prepared, and &s;ent up to the lords. Then the committee reported, That Mr. Prior had gro&s;ly prevaricated on his examination, and behaved with great contempt of their authority. The duke of Ormond and the lord vi&s;count Bolingbroke having omitted to &s;urren|der them&s;elves within the time limited, the hou&s;e of lords ordered the earl|mar&s;hal to raze out of the li&s;t of peers their names and armorial bearings. In|v $tories were taken of their per&s;onal e&s;tates; and the duke's atchievement, as knight of the garter, was taken down from St. George's chapel at Wind&s;or. A man of candour cannot, without an emotion of grief and indignation, reflect upon the ruin of the noble family of Ormond, in the per&s;on of a brave, gene|rous, and humane nobleman, to whom no crime was imputed, but that of hav|ing obeyed the command of his &s;overeign. About this period the royal a&s;&s;ent was given to an act for encouraging loyalty in Scotland. By this law, the te|nant who continued peaceable while his lord took arms in favour of the preten|der, was inve&s;ted with the property of the lands he rented; and, on the other hand it was decreed, That the lands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any per&s;on guilty of high|trea&s;on$ &s;hould revert to the &s;uperior of whom they were held, and be con&s;olidated with the &s;uperiority: and, That all intails and &s;ettlements of e&s;tates &s;ince the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t$ in favour of children, with a fraudulent intent to avoid the puni&s;hment of the law due to the offence of high-trea&s;on, &s;hould be null and void. It likewi&s;e contained a clau&s;e for &s;ummoning &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, to find bail for their good behaviour, on pain of being denounced rebels. By virtue of this clau&s;e all the heads of the Jacobite clans$ and other &s;upected per&s;ons, were &s;ummoned to Edinburgh; and tho&s;e who did not appear were declared rebels.</P>

<P>By this time the rebellion was actually begun in Scotland. The di&s;|&s;en&s;ions occa&s;ioned in that country by the union had never been wholly appea&s;ed. Even &s;ince the queen's death, addre&s;&s;&s;es were prepared in different parts of Scot|land again&s;t the union, which was deemed a national grievance; and the Ja|cobites did not fail to encourage this aver&s;ion. Though their hopes of di&s;&s;olving that treaty were baffled by the industry and other arts of t$$ Revolutioners, who &s;ecured a majority of Whigs in parliament$ they did not lay a&s;ide their de&s;ign of attempting &s;omething of con&s;equence in favour of the pretender; but main|tained a corre&s;pondence with the malcontents of England$ a great number of whom were driven by apprehen&s;ion, hard u&s;age, and re&s;entment, into a &s;y&s;tem of politics which other$$$$ they would not have e&s;pou&s;ed. The Tori$s finding them&s;elves totally exclu$$d from any &s;hare in the government and legi&s;lature, and expo&s;ed to the in&s;olence and fury of a faction which they de&s;pi&s;ed, began to
<PB N="443" REF="4460">
wi&s;h in earne&s;t for a revolution. Some of them held private con&s;ultations, and communicated with the Jacobites, who conveyed their &s;entiments to the che|valier de St. George, with &s;uch exaggerations as were dictated by their own eagerne&s;s and extravagance. They a&s;&s;ured the pretender, that the nation was wholly di&s;affected to the new government; and indeed, the clamours, tumults, and conver&s;ation of the people in general, countenanced this a&s;&s;ertion. They promi&s;ed to take arms without further delay in his favour; and engaged that the Tories &s;hould join them at his fir&s;t landing in Great-Britain. They, there|fore, be&s;ought him to come over with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, declaring, that his appearance would produce an immediate revolution. The chevalier re&s;olved to take the advantage of this favourable di&s;po&s;ition. He had recour&s;e to the French king, who had always been the refuge of his family. Lewis favoured him in &s;ecret; and, notwith&s;tanding his late engagements with England, cheri&s;hed the ambition of rai&s;ing him to the throne of Great Britain. He &s;upplied him privately with &s;ums of money, to prepare a &s;mall armament in the port of Havre, which was equipped in the name of Depine D'Anicaut: and without all doubt, his de&s;ign was to a&s;&s;i&s;t him more effectually, in proportion as the Engli&s;h &s;hould manife&s;t their attachment to the hou&s;e of Stuart. The duke of Ormond and the lord Bolingbroke, who had retired to France, finding them|&s;elves condemned unheard, and attainted, engaged in the &s;ervice of the cheva|lier, and corre&s;ponded with the Tories of England.</P>

<P>All the&s;e intrigues and machinations were di&s;covered and communi|cated to the court of London by the earl of Stair, who then re&s;ided as Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris. He was a nobleman of unque&s;tioned honour and inte|grity, generous, humane, di&s;cerning, and re&s;olute. He had &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his valour, intrepidity, and other military talents, during the war in the Ne|therlands; and he now acted in another &s;phere with uncommon vigour, vigi|lance, and addre&s;s. He detected the chevalier's &s;cheme while it was yet in em|bryo, and gave &s;uch early notice of it, as enabled the king of Great Britain to take effectual mea&s;ures for defeating the de&s;ign. All the pretender's intere&s;t in France expired with Lewis XIV. that o&s;tentatious tyrant, who had for above half a century &s;acrificed the repo&s;e of Chri&s;tendom to his in&s;atiate vanity and am|bition. At his death, which happened on the fir&s;t day of September, the regency of the kingdom devolved to the duke of Orleans, who adopted a new &s;y&s;tem of politics, and had already entered into engagements with the king of Great-Britain. In&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the pretender, he amu&s;ed his agents with my&s;terious and equivocal expre&s;&s;ions, calculated to fru&s;trate the de&s;ign of the expedition. Neverthele&s;s, the more violent part of the Jacobites in Great-Britain believed he was at bottom a friend to their cau&s;e; and depended upon him for &s;uccour. They even extorted from him a &s;um of money by dint of importunities, and &s;ome arms; but the ve&s;&s;el was &s;hipwrecked, and the cargo lo&s;t upon the coa&s;t of Scotland.</P>

<P>The parti&s;ans of the pretender had proceeded too far to retreat with &s;afety; and therefore re&s;olved to try their fortune in the field. The earl of Mar repaired to the Highlands, where he held con&s;ultations with the mar|qui&s;&s;es of Huntley and Tullibardine, the earls Mari&s;chal and Southe&s;k, the generals Hamilton and Gordon, with the chiefs of the Jacobite clans. Then he a&s;&s;embled three hundred of his own va&s;&s;als, proclaimed the pretender at
<PB N="444" REF="4470">
Ca&s;tletown, and &s;et up his &s;tandard at Brae-Mar on the &s;ixth day of September. By this time the earls of Home, Wigtoun, and Kinnoul, the lord De&s;kford, and Lockhart of Carnwath, with other per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection to the pre&s;ent government, were committed pri&s;oners to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; and major-general Whetham marched with the regular troops which were in that kingdom to &s;ecure the bridge of Stirling. Before the&s;e precautions were taken two ve&s;&s;els had arrived at Arbroath from Havre, with arms, ammunition, and a good number of officers, who a&s;&s;ured the earl of Mar, that the pretender would &s;oon be with him in per&s;on. The death of Lewis XIV. &s;truck a general damp upon their &s;pirits; but they layed their account with being joined by a power|ful body in England. The earl of Mar, by letters and me&s;&s;ages, pre&s;&s;ed the chevaller to come over without further delay. He, in the mean time, a&s;&s;umed the title of lieutenant-general of the pretender's forces, publi&s;hed a declaration, exhorting the people to take arms for their lawful fovereign; and this was fol|lowed by a &s;hrewd manife&s;to, explaining the national grievances, and a&s;&s;uring the people of redre&s;s. Some of his parti&s;ans attempted to &s;urpri&s;e the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; but were prevented by the vigilance and activity of colonel Stuart, Leutenant-governor of that fortre&s;s. The duke of Argyle &s;et out for Scotland as commander in chief of the forces in North-Britain: the earl of Sutherland &s;et &s;ail in the Queenborough &s;hip of war for the North, where he propo&s;ed to rai&s;e his va&s;&s;als for the &s;ervice of the government; and many other Scotti&s;h peers returned to their own country, in order to &s;ignalize their loyalty to king George.</P>

<P>In England the practices of the Jacobites did not e&s;cape the notice of the mini&s;try. Lieutenant colonel Paul was impri&s;oned in the Gate-hou&s;e, for inli&s;ting men in the &s;ervice of the pretender. The titular duke of Powis was com|mitted to the Tower: the lords Lan&s;down and Duplin were taken into cu&s;tody; and a warrant was i&s;&s;ued for apprehending the earl of Jer&s;ey. The king de&s;ired the con&s;ent of the lower hou&s;e to &s;eize and detain Sir William Wyndham, Sir John Packington, Mr. Edward Harvey of Combe, Mr. Thomas For&s;ter, Mr. John An&s;tis, and Mr. Corbet Kyna&s;ton, who were members of the hou&s;e, and &s;u&s;|pected of favouring the inva&s;ion. The commons unanimou&s;ly agreed to the propo&s;al, and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, &s;ignifying their approbation. Harvey and An&s;tis were immediately &s;ecured. For&s;ter, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome popi&s;h lords, a&s;&s;embled a body of men in Northumberland: Sir John Packington being examined before the council, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for want of evidence. Mr. Kyna&s;ton ab&s;conded: Sir William Wyndham was &s;eized at his own hou&s;e in Somer&s;et&s;hire, by colonel Hu&s;ke and a me&s;&s;enger, who &s;ecured his papers: he found means, however, to e&s;cape from them; but afterwards &s;urrendered him|&s;elf, and having been examined at the council-board, was committed to the Tower. His father-in-law the duke of Somer&s;et offered to become bound for his appearance; and being rejected as bail, expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment &s;o warmly, that the king thought proper to remove him from the office of ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of September the king went to the hou&s;e of lords$ and pa&s;&s;ed the bills that were ready for the royal a&s;&s;ent. Then the chancellor read his maje&s;ty's &s;peech, expre&s;&s;ing his acknowledgment and &s;ati&s;|faction for the uncommon marks of their affection he had received; and the parliament adjourned to the &s;ixth day of October.</P>

<P>The friends of the hou&s;e of Stuart were very numerous in the we&s;tern counties, and began to make preparations for an in&s;urrection. They had concealed &s;ome arms and artillery at Bath, and formed a de&s;ign to &s;urpri&s;e Bri&s;tol: but they were betrayed and di&s;covered by the emi&s;&s;aries of the govern|ment; which baffled all their &s;chemes, and apprehended every per&s;on of con|&s;equence &s;u&s;pected of attachment to that cau&s;e. The univer&s;ity of Oxford felt the rod of power on this occa&s;ion. Major-general Pepper, with a &s;trong de|tachment of dragoons, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city at day break, declaring he would u&s;e military execution on all &s;tudents who &s;hould pre&s;ume to appear without the limits of their re&s;pective colleges. He &s;eized ten or eleven per|&s;ons, among whom was one Lloyd, a coffeeman; and made prize of &s;ome hor&s;es and furniture belonging to colonel Owen, and other gentlemen. With this booty he retreated to Abingdon; and Handa&s;yde's regiment of foot was afterwards quartered in Oxford, to overawe the univer&s;ity. The mini&s;try found it more difficult to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;urgents in the northern counties. In the month of October, the earl of Derwentwater and Mr. For&s;ter took the field with a body of hor&s;e, and being joined by &s;ome gentlemen from the borders of Scotland, proclaimed the pretender in Warkworth, Morpeth, and Alnwick. Their fir&s;t de&s;ign was to &s;eize the town of Newca&s;tle, in which they had many friends: but they found the gates &s;hut upon them, and retired to Hexham; while general Carpenter having a&s;&s;embled a body of dragoons, re&s;olved to march from Newca&s;tle and attack them before they &s;hould be reinforced. The rebels retiring northward to Wooler, were joined by two hundred Scotti&s;h hor&s;e under the lord vi&s;count Kenmuir, and the earls of Carnwath and Win|toun, who had &s;et up the pretender's &s;tandard at Moffat, and proclaimed him in different parts of Scotland. The rebels thus reinforced, advanced to Kel&s;o, having received advice that there they would be joined by Mackinto&s;h, who had cro&s;&s;ed the Forth with a body of Highlanders.</P>

<P>By this time the earl of Mar was at the head of ten thou&s;and men well armed. He had &s;ecured the pa&s;s of the Tay at Perth, where his head|quarters were e&s;tabli&s;hed, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole fruitful pro|vince of Fife, and all the &s;ea-coa&s;t on that &s;ide of the frith of Edinburgh. He &s;elected two thou&s;and five hundred men, commanded by brigadier Mackinto&s;h, to make a de&s;cent upon the Lothian &s;ide, and join the Jacobites in that county, or &s;uch as &s;hould take arms on the borders of England. Boats were a&s;&s;embled for this purpo&s;e; and, notwith&s;tanding all the precautions that could be taken by the king's &s;hips in the frith, to prevent the de&s;ign, above fifteen hundred cho&s;en men made good their pa&s;&s;age in the night, and landed on the coa&s;t of Lothian, having cro&s;&s;ed an arm of the &s;ea about &s;ixteen miles broad, in open boats that pa&s;&s;ed through the mid&s;t of the king's crui&s;ers. Nothing could be better concerted, or executed with more conduct and courage, than was this hazardous enterprize. They amu&s;ed the king's &s;hips with marches and coun|termarches along the coa&s;t, in &s;uch a manner that they could not po&s;&s;ibly know where they intended to embark. The earl of Mar, in the mean time, marched from Perth to Dumblaine, as if he had intended to cro&s;s the Forth at Stirling-bridge: but his real de&s;ign was to divert the duke of Argyle from at|tacking his detachment which had landed in Lothian. So far the &s;cheme &s;uc|ceeded. The duke, who had a&s;&s;embled &s;ome troops in Lothian, returned to

The Engli&s;h in$i$ted upon cro&s;&s;ing the Tweed, and atta$$ing general Carpenter$ who&s;e troops did not exceed nine hundred $rago$ns. $word$ &s;cheme was executed. They took the route to Jedburgh, where they re&s;olved to leave Carpenter on one &s;ide, and penetrate into England by the we&s;tern border. The Highlanders declared they would not $uit their own country; but were ready to execute the &s;cheme propo&s;ed by the earl of Wintoun. Means however were found to prevail upon one half of them to advance, while the re&s;t returned to the Highlands. At Bramp|ton For&s;ter opened his commi&s;&s;ion of general, which had been &s;ent to him from the earl of Man, and proclaimed the pretender. They continued their march to Penrith, where the &s;heriff, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the lord Lon&s;dale and the bi&s;hop of Cha$$le, had a&s;&s;embled the whole po&s;&s;e comitatus of Cumberland, amounting to twelve thou&s;and men, who di&s;per&s;ed with the utmo&s;t precipitation at the ap|proach of the rebels. From Penrith, For&s;ter proceeded by the way of Kendal and Lanca&s;ter to Pre&s;ton, from whence Stanhope's regiment of dragoons, and another of militia$ immediately retired; &s;o that he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place without re&s;i&s;tance. General Wills marched again&s;t the enemy with &s;ix regiments of hor&s;e and dragoons, and one battalion of foot commanded by colonel Pre&s;ton. They had advanced to the bridge of Ribble before For&s;ter received intelligence of their approach. He forthwith began to rai&s;e barrica|does, and put the place in a po&s;ture of defence. On the twelfth day of No|vember, the town was bri&s;kly attacked in two different places: but the king's troops met with a very warm reception, and were repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. Next day general Carpenter arrived with a reinforcement of three regiments of dragoons; and the rebels were inve&s;ted on all &s;ides. The Highlanders de|clared they would make a &s;ally &s;word in hand, and either cut their way through the king's troops, or peri&s;h in the attempt; but they were over-ruled. For&s;ter &s;ent colonel Oxburgh with a trumpet to general Wills, to propo&s;e a capitulation. He was given to under&s;tand, that the general would not treat with rebels; but, in ca&s;e of their &s;urrendering at di&s;cretion, he would prevent his &s;oldiers from putting them to the &s;word, until he &s;hould receive further orders. He granted them time to con&s;ider till next morning, upon their delivering the earl of Der|wentwater and Mackinto&s;h as ho&s;tages. When For&s;ter &s;ubmitted, this High|lander declared, he could not promi&s;e that the S$$rs would &s;$$render in that

manner. The general de&s;ired him to return to his people, and he would forth|with attack the town, in which ca&s;e every man of them &s;hould be cut in pieces. The Scotti&s;h noblemen did not chu&s;e to run that ri&s;que; and per&s;uaded the Highlanders to accept the terms that were offered. They accordingly layed down their arms, and were put under a &s;trong guard. All the noblemen and leaders were &s;ecured. Major Nairn, captain Lockhart, captain Sha&s;toe, and en&s;ign Er&s;kine, were tried by a court-martial as de&s;erters, and executed. Lord Charles Murray, &s;on of the duke of Athole, was likewi&s;e condemned for the &s;ame crime, but reprieved. The common men were impri&s;oned at Che&s;ter and Liverpool: the noblemen and con&s;iderable officers were &s;ent to London, conveyed through the &s;treets, pinioned like malefactors, and committed to the Power and to Newgate.</P>

<P>The very day on which the rebels &s;urrendered at Pre&s;ton, was re|markable for the battle of Dumblaine, fought between the duke of Argyle and the earl of Mar, who commanded the pretender's forces. This nobleman had retreated to his camp at Perth, when he under&s;tood the duke was returned from Lothian to Stirling. But being now joined by the northern clans under the earl of Seaforth, and tho&s;e of the we&s;t commanded by general Gordon, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in the &s;ervice of the czar of Mu&s;covy, he re&s;olved to pa&s;s the Forth, in order to join his &s;outhern friends, that they might march to|gether into England. With this view he marched to Auchterardere, where he reviewed his army, and re&s;ted on the eleventh day of November. The duke of Argyle, appri&s;ed of his intention, and being joined by &s;ome regiments of dragoons from Ireland, determined to give him battle in the neighbourhood of Dumblaine. On the twelfth day of the month he pa&s;&s;ed the Forth at Stirling, and encamped with his left at the village of Dumblaine, and his right towards Sheriff-moor. The earl of Mar advanced within two miles of his camp, and remained till day-break in order of battle; his army con&s;i&s;ting of nine thou&s;and effective men, cavalry as well as infantry. In the morning, the duke under&s;tanding they were in motion, drew up his forces, which did not exceed three thou&s;and five hundred men, on the heights to the north-ea&s;t of Dumblaine: but he was out&s;lanked both on the right and left. The clans that formed part of the centre and right wing of the enemy, with Clanronald and Glengary at their head, charged the left of the king's army &s;word in hand, with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity that in &s;even minutes both hor&s;e and foot were totally routed with great &s;laughter; and general Whetham who commanded them, fled at full gallop to Stirling, where he declared that the royal army was to|tally defeated. In the mean time, the duke of Argyle, who commanded in per&s;on on the right, attacked the left of the enemy, at the head of Stair's and Evans's dragoons, and drove them two miles before him, as far as the water of Allan: though in that &s;pace they wheeled about and attempted to rally ten times; &s;o that he was obliged to pre&s;s them hard, that they might not recover from their confu&s;ion. Brigadier Wightman followed, in order to &s;u&s;tain him with three battalions of infantry; while the victorious right wing of the rebels having pur&s;ued Whetham a con&s;iderable way, returned to the field and formed in the rear of Wightman, to the amount of five thou&s;and men. The duke of Argyle returning from the pur&s;uit, joined Wightman, who had faced about and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome inclo&s;ures and mud-walls, in expectation of being
<PB N="448" REF="4510">
attacked. In this po&s;ture both armies fronted each other till the evening, when the duke drew off towards Dumblaine, and the rebels retired to Ardoch, without mutual mole&s;tation. Next day, the duke marching back to the field of battle, carried off the wounded, with four pieces of cannon left by the enemy, and retreated to Stirling. Few pri&s;oners were taken on either &s;ide: the number of the &s;$$n might be about five hundred of each army, and both $word$ Claimed the victory. This battle was not &s;o fatal to the Highlanders as the lo&s;s of Inverne&s;s, from which Sir John Mackenzie was driven by Simon Frazer lord Lovat, who, contrary to the principles he had latherto profe&s;&s;ed, &s;ecured this important po&s;t for the government; by which means a free com|munication was opened with the north of Scotland, where the earl of Sutherland had rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable body of va&s;&s;als. The marquis of Huntley and the earl of Seaforth were obliged to quit the rebel army, in order to defend them own territories; and in a little time &s;ubmitted to king George: a good num|ber of the Frazers declared with their chief again&s;t the pretender: the marquis of Tullibardine withdrew from the army to cover his own country; and the cla$s &s;eeing no likelihood of another action, began to di&s;per&s;e, according to cu&s;tom.</P>

<P>The government was now in a condition to &s;end &s;trong rein|forcements to Scotland. Six thou&s;and men that were claimed of the &s;tates-general by virtue of the treaty, landed in England, and began their match for Edinburgh: general Cadogan &s;et out for the &s;ame place, together with brigadier Petit and &s;ix other engineers; and a train of artillery was &s;hipped at the Tower for that country, the duke of Argyle re&s;olving to drive the earl of Mar out of Perth, to which town he had retired with the remains of his forces. The pretender having been amu&s;ed with the hope of &s;eeing the whole king|dom of England ri&s;e up as one man in his behalf; and the duke of Ormond having made a fruitle&s;s voyage to the we&s;tern coa&s;t, to try the di&s;po&s;ition of the people, he was now convinced of the vanity of his expectation in that quar|ter; and, as he knew not what other cour&s;e to take, he re&s;olved to hazard his per&s;on among his friends in Scotland, at a time when his affairs in that king|dom were ab&s;olutely de&s;perate. From Brittany he po&s;ted through part of France, in di&s;gui&s;e, and embarking in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el at Dunkirk, hired for that purpo&s;e, arrived on the twenty-&s;econd day of December at Peterhead, with &s;ix gentlemen in his retinue, one of whom was the marquis of Tinmouth, &s;on to the duke of Berwick. He pa&s;&s;ed through Aberdeen incognito, to Fettero&s;&s;e, where he was met by the earls of Mar and Mari&s;chal, and about thirty noble|men and gentlemen of the fir&s;t quality. Here he was &s;olemnly proclaimed; his declaration, dated at Commercy, was printed and circulated through all the parts in that neighbourhood; and here he received addre&s;&s;es from the epi&s;copal clergy, and the laity of that communion in the dioce&s;e of Aberdeen. On the fifth day of January, he made his public entry into Dundee; and on the &s;eventh arrived at Scoon, where he &s;eemed determined to &s;tay until the ceremony of his coronation &s;hould be performed. From thence he made an excur&s;ion to Perth, where he reviewed his forces. Then he formed a regular council; and publi&s;hed proclamations; for a general thank&s;giving, on account of his fare arrival; enjoining the mini&s;ters to pray for him in churches; e&s;tabli&s;hing the currency of foreign coins; &s;ummoning the meeting of the convention of e&s;tates;
<PB N="449" REF="4520">
ordering all &s;en&s;ible men to repair to his &s;tandard, and fixing the twenty-third day of January for his coronation. He made a pathetic &s;peech in a grand council, at which all the chiefs of his party a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Here they determined to abandon the enterprize, as the king's army was reinforced by the Dutch auxiliaries, and they them&s;elves were not only reduced to a &s;mall number, but likewi&s;e de&s;titute of money, arms, ammunition, forage, and provi&s;ion: for the duke of Argyle had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Burnti&s;land, and tran&s;ported a de|tachment to Fife, &s;o as to cut off Mar's communication with that fertile county.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the weather, and a prodigious fall of &s;now which rendered the roads almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able, the duke, on the twenty-ninth of January, began his march to Dumblaine, and next day reached Tullibardine, where he received intelligence that the pretender and his forces had, on the preceding day, retired towards Dundee. He forthwith took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Perth; and then began his march to Aberbrothick, in pur&s;uit of the enemy. The chevalier de St. George being thus hotly pur&s;ued, was prevailed upon to embark on board of a &s;mall French &s;hip that lay in the harbour of Montro&s;e. He was accompanied by the earls of Mar and Melfort, the lord Drummond, lieutenant-general Bulkley, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, to the number of &s;eventeen. In order to avoid the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, they &s;tretched over to Norway, and coa&s;ting along the German and Dutch &s;hores, arrived in five days at Gravelin. General Gordon, whom the pretender had left com|mander in chief of the forces, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the earl Mari&s;chal, pro|ceeded with them to Aberdeen, where he &s;ecured three ve&s;&s;els to &s;all north|ward and take on board the per&s;ons who intended to make their e&s;cape to the continent. Then they continued their march through Strath&s;pey and Strath|down, to the hills of Badenoch, where the common people were quietly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed. This retreat was made with &s;uch expedition, that the duke of Argyle, with all his activity, could never overtake their rear-guard, which con&s;i&s;ted of a thou&s;and hor&s;e, commanded by the earl Mari&s;chal. Such was the i&s;&s;ue of a rebellion that proved fatal to many noble families: a rebellion which, in all probability, would never have happened, had not the violent mea&s;ures of a Whig mini&s;try kindled &s;uch a flame of di&s;content in the nation, as encouraged the partizans of the pretender to hazard a revolt.</P>

<P>The parliament of Ireland, which met at Dublin on the twelfth day of November, &s;eemed even more zealous, if po&s;&s;ible, than that of England, for the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. They pa&s;&s;ed bills for recognizing the king's title; for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on and government; for &s;etting a price on the pre|tender's head; and for attainting the duke of Ormond. They granted the &s;upplies without oppo&s;ition. All tho&s;e who had addre&s;&s;ed the late queen in favour of Sir Con&s;tantine Phipps, then lord chancellor of Ireland, were now brought upon their knees, and cen&s;ured as guilty of a breach of privilege. They de&s;ired the lords-ju&s;tices would i&s;&s;ue a proclamation again&s;t the popi&s;h inhabitants of Limerick and Galway, who, pre&s;uming upon the capitulation &s;igned by king William, claimed an exemption from the penalties impo&s;ed upon other papi&s;ts. They engaged in an a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t the pretender and all his abettors. They voted the earl of Angle&s;ey an enemy to the king and kingdom, becau&s;e he had advi&s;ed the queen to break the army and prorogue
<PB N="450" REF="4530">
the late parliament; and they addre&s;&s;ed the king to remove him from his council and &s;ervice. The lords-ju&s;tices granted orders for apprehending the earls of Antrim and We&s;tmeath, the lords Natterville, Cahir, and Dillon, as per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection to the government. Then they adjourned the two hou&s;es.</P>

<P>The king, in his &s;peech to the Engli&s;h parliament, which met on the n$nth of January, told them he had rea&s;on to believe the pretender was landed in Scotland: he congratulated them on the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the rebellion: on the conclu&s;ion of the barrier treaty between the emperor and the &s;tates-general, under his guaranty: on a convention with Spain that would deliver the trade of England to that kingdom, from the new impo&s;itions and hard&s;hips to which it was &s;ubjected in con&s;equence of the late treaties. He likewi&s;e gave them to under&s;tand, that a treaty for renewing all former al|liances between the crown of Great-Britain and the &s;tates-general, was almo&s;t concluded; and he a&s;&s;ured the commons he would freely give up all the e&s;tates that &s;hould become forfeited to the crown by this rebellion, to be applied to|wards defraying the extraordinary expence incurred on this occa&s;ion. The commons, in their addre&s;s of thanks, declared that they would pro&s;ecute, in the mo&s;t vigorous and impartial manner, the authors of tho&s;e de&s;tructive coun&s;els which had drawn down &s;uch mi&s;eries upon the nation. Their re&s;olu|tions were &s;peedy, and exactly conformable to this declaration. They expelled Mr. For&s;ter from the hou&s;e. They forthwith impeached the earls of Der|wentwater, Nith&s;dale, Carnwath, and Wintoun; the lords Widdrington, Kenmuir, and Nairn. The&s;e noblemen being brought to the bar of the hou&s;e of lords, heard the articles of impeachment read on the tenth day of January, and were ordered to put in their an&s;wers on the &s;ixteenth. The impeachments being lodged, the lower-hou&s;e ordered a bill to be brought in for continuing the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the habeas corpus act: then they prepared another to attaint the marquis of Tullibardine, the earls of Mar and Linlithgow, and lord John Drummond. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of January, the king gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to the bill for continuing the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the habeas corpus act. He told the parliament that the pretender was actually in Scotland, heading the rebellion, and a&s;&s;uming the &s;tile and title of king of the&s;e realms: he demanded of the commons &s;uch &s;upply as might di&s;courage any foreign power from a&s;|&s;i&s;ting the rebels. On Thur&s;day the nineteenth day of January, all the im|peached lords pleaded guilty to the articles exhibited again&s;t them, except the earl of Wintoun, who petitioned for a longer time, on various pretences. The re&s;t received &s;entence of death on the ninth day of February, in the court erected in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, where the lord-chancellor Cowper pre&s;ided as lord high-&s;teward on that occa&s;ion. The counte&s;s of Nith&s;dale and lady Nairn threw them&s;elves at the king's feet as he pa&s;&s;ed through the apartments of the palace$ and implored his mercy in behalf of their hu&s;bands: but their tears and intreaties produced no effect. The council re&s;olved that the &s;entence &s;hould be executed, and orders were given for that purpo&s;e to the lieutenant of the Tower, and the &s;heriffs of London and Middle&s;ex.</P>

<P>The counte&s;s of Derwentwater, with her &s;i&s;ter, accompanied by the dutche&s;&s;es of Cleveland and Bolton, and &s;everal other ladies of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, was introduced by the dukes of Richmond and St. Alban's, into
<PB N="451" REF="4540">
the king's bed-chamber, where &s;he invoked his maje&s;ty's clemency for her unfortunate confort. She afterwards repaired to the lobby of the hou&s;e of peers, attended by the ladies of the other condemned lords, and above twenty others of the &s;ame quality, and begged the interce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e: but no regard was payed to their petition. Next day, they petitioned both hou&s;es of parliament. The commons rejected their &s;uit. In the upper hou&s;e, the duke of Richmond delivered a petition from the earl of Derwentwater, to whom he was nearly related, at the &s;ame time declaring, that he him&s;elf &s;hould oppo&s;e his &s;ollicitation. The earl of Derby expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion for the nume|rous family of lord Nairn. Petitions from the re&s;t were pre&s;ented by other lords, moved with pity and humanity. Lord Town&s;hend and others vehemently oppo&s;ed their being read. The earl of Nottingham thought this indulgence might be granted: the hou&s;e a&s;&s;ented to his opinion; and agreed to an addre&s;s, praying his maje&s;ty would reprieve &s;uch of the condemned lords as &s;hould de|&s;erve his mercy. To this petition the king an&s;wered, That on this and all other occa&s;ions, he would do what he thought mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of his crown and the &s;afety of his people. The earl of Nottingham, pre&s;ident of the council; his brother the earl of Ayle&s;bury, chancellor of the dutchy of Lanca&s;ter; his &s;on lord Finch, one of the lords of the trea&s;ury; his kin&s;man lord Guern&s;ey, ma&s;ter of the jewel office, were altogether di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. Orders were di&s;patched for executing the earls of Derwent|water and Nith&s;dale, and the vi&s;count of Kenmuir, immediately: the others were re&s;pited to the &s;eventh day of March. Nith&s;dale made his e&s;cape in woman's apparel, furni&s;hed and conveyed to him by his mother. On the twenty-fourth day of February, Derwentwater and Kenmuir were beheaded on Tower-hill. The former was an amiable youth, brave, open, generous, ho&s;pitable, and humane. His fate drew tears from the &s;pectators, and was a great misfortune to the country in which he lived. He gave bread to multi|tudes of people whom he employed on his e&s;tate: the poor, the widow, and the orphan, rejoiced in his bounty. Kenmuir was a virtuous nobleman, calm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals Bolingbroke. Patten. Deb. in Parl. Tindal. State Trials.</NOTE> &s;en&s;ible, re&s;olute, and re&s;igned. He was a devout member of the Engli&s;h church; but the other died in the faith of Rome: both adhered to their poli|tical principles. On the fifteenth day of March, Wintoun was brought to his trial, and being convicted, received &s;entence of death.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1716.</NOTE> When the king pa&s;&s;ed the land-tax bill, which was u&s;hered in with a very extraordinary preamble, he informed both hou&s;es of the pretender's flight from Scotland. In the beginning of April, a commi&s;&s;ion for trying the rebels met in the court of common pleas, when bills of high trea&s;on were found again&s;t Mr. For&s;ter, Mackinto&s;h, and twenty of their confederates. For&s;ter e&s;caped from Newgate, and reached the continent in &s;afety: the re&s;t pleaded Not guilty, and were indulged with time to prepare for their trials. The judges appointed to try the rebels at Liverpool found a con&s;iderable number guilty of high-trea&s;on. Two and twenty were executed at Pre&s;ton and Manche&s;ter: about a thou&s;and pri&s;oners &s;ubmitted to the king's mercy, and petitioned for tran&s;portation. Pitts, the keeper of Newgate, being &s;u&s;|pected of having connived at For&s;ter's e&s;cape, was tried for his life at the Old Bailey, and acquitted.

other pri&s;oners, broke from Newgate, after having ma&s;tered the keeper and turnkey, and di&s;$rmed the centinel. The court proceeded with the trials of tho&s;e that remained; a great number was found guilty; four or five were hanged, drawn, and quartered, at Tyburn; and among the&s;e William Paul, a clergyman, who, in his la&s;t &s;peech, profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a true and &s;incere mem|ber of the church of England, but not of the revolution &s;chi&s;matical church, who&s;e bi&s;hops had abandoned the king, and &s;hamefully given up their eccle&s;i|a&s;tical rights, by &s;ubmitting to the unlawful, invalid, lay-deprivations autho|ri&s;ed by the prince of Orange.</P>

<P>Though the rebellion was extingui&s;hed, the flame of national di&s;&s;atisfaction &s;till continued to rage: the &s;everities exerci&s;ed again&s;t the rebels increa&s;ed the general di&s;content: for now the danger was blown over, their humane p$&s;&s;$ons began to prevail. The courage and fortitude with which the condemned per&s;ons encountered the pains of death in its mo&s;t dreadful form, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many &s;pectators in favour of the cau&s;e by which tho&s;e unhappy victims were animated. In a word, per&s;ecution, as u&s;ual, extended the here&s;y. The mini&s;try perceiving this univer&s;al di&s;affection, and dreading the revolution of a new parliament, which might wre&s;t the power from their faction, and retort upon them the violence of their own mea&s;ures, formed a re&s;olution equally odious and effectual to e&s;tabli&s;h their admini&s;tration. This was no other than a &s;cheme to repeal the triennial act, and by a new law to extend the term of parliaments to &s;even years. On the tenth day of April, the duke of Devon&s;hire repre&s;ented, in the hou&s;e of lords, that triennial elections &s;erved to keep up party-divi&s;ions; to rai&s;e and foment feuds in private families; to produce ruinous expences, and give occa&s;ion to the cabals and intrigues of foreign princes: that it became the wi&s;dom of &s;uch an augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly to ap|ply proper remedies to an evil that might be attended with the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences, e&s;peciaily in the pre&s;ent temper of the nation, as the &s;pirit of rebellion &s;till remained unconquered. He therefore propo&s;ed a bill for enlarg|ing the continuance of parliaments. He was &s;econded by the earls of Dor&s;et and Rockingham, the duke of Argyle, the lord Town&s;hend, and the other chiefs of that party. The motion was oppo&s;ed by the earls of Nottingham, Abingdon, and Powlet. They ob&s;erved, that frequent parliaments were re|quired by the fundamental con&s;titution of the kingdom$ a&s;certained in the pra$t$ce of many ages: that the members of the lower hou&s;e were cho&s;en by the p$$ple for a certain term of years, at the expiration of which they could be no longer repre&s;entatives of the people, who, by the parliament's protracting its own authority, would be deprived of the only remedy which they have again&s;t tho&s;e who, through ignorance or corruption, betrayed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them: that the r$a&s;ons in favour of &s;uch a bill were weak and frivolous: that, with re&s;p$$t to foreign alliances, no prince or &s;tate could rea&s;onably de|pend upon a people to defend their lib$rties and intere&s;ts, who &s;hould be thought to have given up &s;o great a part of their own: nor would it be prudent in them to wi&s;h for a change in that con&s;titution under which Europe had of late been &s;o powerfully &s;upported. On the contrary, they might be deterred from entering into any engagements with Great Britain, when in|formed by the preamble of the bill, that the popi&s;h fa$$ion was &s;o dangerous as to threaten $$&s;iruction to the government: they would apprehend that the
<PB N="453" REF="4560">
admini&s;tration was &s;o weak as to want &s;o extraordinary a provi&s;ion for its &s;afety: that the gentlemen of Britain were not to be tru&s;ted: and, that the good affec|tions of the people were re&s;trained within the limits of the hou&s;e of commons. They affirmed that this bill, far from preventing the expence of elections, would rather increa&s;e it, and encourage every practice of corruption; for, the value of a &s;eat would always be in proportion to the duration of a parliament; and the purcha&s;e would ri&s;e accordingly. That a long parliament would yield a greater temptation, as well as a better opportunity to a vicious mini&s;try, to corrupt the members, than they could po&s;&s;ibly have when the parliaments were &s;hort and frequent: that the &s;ame rea&s;ons urged for pa&s;&s;ing the bill to continue this parliament for &s;even years, would be at lea&s;t as &s;trong, and by the conduct of the mini&s;try, might be made much &s;tronger before the end of that term, for continuing, and even perpetuating their legi&s;lative power, to the ab&s;olute &s;ubver&s;ion of the third e&s;tate of the realm. The&s;e arguments &s;erved only to form a decent debate, after which the bill for &s;eptennial parliaments pa&s;&s;ed by a great majority, though twenty peers entered a prote&s;t. It met with the &s;ame fate in the lower hou&s;e, where many &s;trong objections were &s;tarted to no pur|po&s;e. They were repre&s;ented as the effects of party-&s;pleen; and, indeed, this was the great &s;pring of action on both &s;ides. The que&s;tion for the bill was car|ried in the affirmative; and in a little time it received the royal &s;anction.</P>

<P>The rebellion being utterly quelled, and all the &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons of con&s;equence detained in &s;afe cu&s;tody, the king re&s;olved to vi&s;it his German dominions, where he fore&s;aw a &s;torm gathering from the quarter of Sweden. Charles XII. was extremely exa&s;perated again&s;t the elector of Hanover for hav|ing entered into the confederacy again&s;t him in his ab&s;ence, particularly for his having purcha&s;ed the dutchies of Bremen and Verden, which con&s;tituted part of his dominions; and he breathed nothing but revenge again&s;t the king of Great Britain. It was with a view to avert this danger, or prepare again&s;t it, that the king now determined upon a voyage to the continent. But as he was re&s;tricted from leaving his Briti&s;h dominions, by the act for the further limi|tation of the crown, this clau&s;e was repealed in a new bill that pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es without the lea&s;t difficulty. On the twenty-&s;ixth day of June the king clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech upon the u&s;ual topics, in which, however, he ob&s;erved, that the numerous in&s;tances of mercy he had &s;hewn, &s;erved only to encourage the faction of the pretender, who&s;e parti&s;ans acted with &s;uch in|&s;olence and folly, as if they intended to convince the world, that they were not to be reclaimed by gentle methods. He intimated his purpo&s;e of vi&s;iting his dominions in Germany; and gave them to under&s;tand, that he had con&s;tituted his beloved &s;on, the prince of Wales, guardian of the kingdom in his ab&s;ence. About this period general Macartney, who had returned to England at the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of king George, pre&s;ented him&s;elf to trial for the murder of the duke of Hamilton. The depo&s;ition of colonel Hamilton was contradicted by two park|keepers: the general was acquitted of the charge, re&s;tored to his rank in the army, and gratified with the command of a regiment. The king's brother, prince Ern$&s;t bi&s;hop of O&s;naburg, was created duke of York and Albany, and earl of Ul&s;t$r. The duke of Argyle and the earl of Ilay, to whom his maje|&s;ty owed, in a great me$$ure, his peaceable acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, as well as the extinction of the rebellion in Scotland, were now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from all their

employments General Carpenter &s;ucceeded the duke in the chief command of the forces in Scotland, and in the government of Port-Mahon; and the duke of Montro&s;e was appointed $ord-regi&s;ter of Scotland, in the room of the earl of $$ay.</P>

<P>On the &s;eventh day of July the king embarked at Grave&s;end, lan$$$ on the ninth in Holland, through which he pa&s;&s;ed incognito to Hanover; and from thence &s;et out for Pyrmont. His aim was, to &s;ecure his German do|m$n$$$s from the Swe$e, and Great Britain from the pretender. The&s;e two princes had already begun to form a de&s;ign, in conjunction, of invading his king|dom. He knew the duke of Orleans re&s;olved to a&s;cend the throne of France, in ca&s;e the young king, who was a &s;ickly child, &s;hould die without male i&s;&s;ue. The regent was not ignorant, that Philip of Spain would powerfully conte&s;t that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion$ notwith&s;tanding his renunciation; and he was glad of an oppor|tunity to &s;trengthen his intere&s;t by an alliance with the maritime powers of England and Holland. The king of England founded him on this &s;ubject, and found him eager to engage in &s;uch an a&s;&s;ociation. The negotiation was $word$ on by general $adogan for England, the abb&eacute; du Bois for France, and the pen&s;ionary Hein&s;ius for the &s;tates-general. The regent readily complied with all their demands. He engaged, that the pretender &s;hould immediately de|part from Avignon to the other &s;ide of the Alps, and never return to Lorrain or France on any pretence what&s;oever: that no rebellious &s;ubjects of Great Britain &s;hould be allowed to re&s;ide in that kingdom: and, that the treaty of Utrecht, with re&s;pect to the demolition of Dunkirk, &s;hould be fully executed to the &s;ati&s;|faction of his Britannic maje&s;ty. The treaty contained a mutual guaranty of all the places po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the contracting powers; of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion on the throne of England, as well as of that of the duke of Orle|ans to the crown of France; and a defen&s;ive alliance, &s;tipulating the pro|portion of &s;hips and forces to be furni&s;hed to that power which &s;hould be di&s;|turbed at home or invaded from abroad. The Engli&s;h people murmured at this treaty. They &s;aid, an unnece&s;&s;ary umbrage was given to Spain, with which the nation had great commercial connexions; and that, on pretence of an inva&s;ion, a body of foreign troops might be introduced to en&s;lave the kingdom.</P>

<P>His maje&s;ty was not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in his endeavours to appea&s;e the king of Sweden. who refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to any overtures until Bremen and Verden &s;hould be re&s;tored. The&s;e the elector of Hanover re&s;olved to keep as a fair purcha&s;e; and he engaged in a confederacy with the enemies of Charles, for the maintenance of this acqui&s;ition. Mean while his rupture with Sweden was extremely prejudicial to the commerce of England, and had well nigh intailed upon the kingdom another inva&s;ion, much more formidable than that which had &s;o lately mi&s;carried. The mini&s;ters of Sweden re&s;ident at London, Paris, and the Hague, maintained a corre&s;pondence with the di&s;affected &s;ubjects of Great Britain. A &s;cheme was formed for the Swedi&s;h king's landing on this i&s;land with a con&s;iderable body of forces, where he &s;hould be joined by the malcontents of the united kingdom. Charles re$i&s;hed the enterprize, which flattered his ambition and $word$ nor was it di&s;agreeable to the czar of Mu&s;covy, who $word$ the elect$$$s offer of joining the Swede again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians, provided he would $$tify the $word$ of Br$m$n and Verden. King George having re|ceived intimation of the$e intrigues, returned to England towards the end of
<PB N="455" REF="4580">
January; and ordered a detachment of foot-guards to &s;ecure count Gyllenburg the Swedi&s;h mini&s;ter, with all his papers. At the &s;ame time Sir Jacob Bancks and Mr. Charles Cae&s;ar, were apprehended. The other foreign mini&s;ters took the alarm, and remon&s;trated to the mini&s;try upon this outrage committed again&s;t the law of nations. The two &s;ecretaries Stanhope and Methuen, wrote circular letters to them, a&s;&s;uring them, that in a day or two they &s;hould be acquainted with the rea&s;ons that induced the king to take &s;uch an extraordi|nary &s;tep. They were generally &s;atisfied with this intimation; but the marquis de Monte Leone, amba&s;&s;ador from Spain, expre&s;&s;ed his concern, that no other way could be found to pre&s;erve the peace of the kingdom, without arre&s;ting the per&s;on of a public mini&s;ter, and &s;eizing all his papers, which were the &s;acred re|po&s;itories of his ma&s;ter's &s;ecrets: he ob&s;erved, that in whatever manner the&s;e two facts might &s;eem to be under&s;tood, they very &s;en&s;ibly wounded the law of nations. About the &s;ame time baron Gortz, the Swedi&s;h re&s;identiary in Hol|land, was &s;eized with his papers at Arnheim, at the de&s;ire of king George, communicated to the &s;tates by Mr. Leathes his mini&s;ter at the Hague. The baron owned he had projected the inva&s;ion, a de&s;ign that was ju&s;tified by the conduct of king George, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted the princes in confederacy again&s;t the king of Sweden, without having received the lea&s;t provocation; who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the king of Denmark in &s;ubduing the dutchies of Bremen and Verden; and then pur|cha&s;ed them of the u&s;urper; and who had, in the cour&s;e of this very &s;ummer, &s;ent a &s;trong &s;quadron of &s;hips to the Baltic, where it joined the Danes and Ru&s;&s;ians again&s;t the Swedi&s;h fleet.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>When the parliament of Great Britain met on the twentieth day of February, the king informed them of the triple alliance he had concluded with France and Holland. He mentioned the projected inva&s;ion; told them he had given orders for laying before them copies of the letters which had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween the Swedi&s;h mini&s;ters on that &s;ubject; and he demanded of the commons &s;uch &s;upplies as &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the kingdom. By tho&s;e papers it appeared, that the &s;cheme projected by baron Gortz was very plau&s;ible, and even ripe for execution; which, however, was po&s;tponed until the army &s;hould be reduced, and the Dutch auxiliaries &s;ent back to their own country. The letters being read in parliament, both hou&s;es pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es, in which they extolled the king's prudence in e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch conventions with foreign potentates, as might repair the gro&s;s defects, and prevent the pernicious con&s;equences of the treaty of Utrecht, which they termed a treacherous and di&s;honourable peace: and, they expre&s;&s;ed their horror and indignation at the malice and ingratitude of tho&s;e who had encouraged an inva&s;ion of their coun|try. He likewi&s;e received an addre&s;s of the &s;ame kind from the convocation; another from the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters; a third from the univer&s;ity of Cambridge; but Oxford was not &s;o lavi&s;h of her compliments. At a meeting of the vice|chancellor and heads of that univer&s;ity, a motion was made for an addre&s;s to the king, on the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the late unnatural rebellion; his maje&s;ty's &s;afe return; and the favour lately &s;hewn to the univer&s;ity, in omitting, at their re|que&s;t, the ceremony of burning in effigy the devil, the pope, the pretender, the duke of Ormond, and the earl of Mar, on the anniver&s;ary of his maje&s;ty's ac|ce&s;&s;ion. Dr. Smalridge bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, ob&s;erved, that the rebellion had been long &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: that there would be no end of addre&s;&s;es, &s;hould one be pre|&s;ented
<PB N="456" REF="4590">
every time that his maje&s;ty returned from his German dominions: that the late favour they had received was overballanced by a whole regiment now quartered upon them and, that there was no precedent for addre&s;&s;ing a king upon his return from his German dominions. The univer&s;ity thought they had rea&s;on to complain of the little regard payed to their remon&s;trance, touching a n$t rai&s;ed in that city by the &s;oldiers there quartered, on pretence, that the anniver&s;ary of the prince's birth-day had not been celebrated with the u&s;ual $word$ Affidavits had been &s;ent up to the council, which &s;eemed to favour the $span$ of the regiment. When the hou&s;e of lords deliberated upon the muti|ny$$$l, by which the &s;oldiers were exempted from arre&s;t for debts, complaint was made of their licentious behaviour at Oxford; with a motion, that they &s;hould inquire into the riot. They pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, de&s;iring, that the pa|pers relating to that affair might be layed before the hou&s;e. The&s;e being peru&s;ed, were found to be recriminations between the Oxonians and the officers of the regiment. A warm debate en&s;ued, during which, the earl of Abingdon offered a petition from the vice chancellor of the univer&s;ity, the mayor, and magi&s;trates of Oxford, praying to be heard. One of the court-members ob&s;erving, that it would be irregular to receive a petition while the hou&s;e was in a grand com|mittee, a motion was made, that the chairman &s;hould leave the chair: but, this being carried in the negative, the debate was re&s;umed, and the majority agreed to the following re&s;olutions: That the heads of the univer&s;ity, and mayor of the city, neglected to make public rejoicings on the prince's birth-day: That the officers having met to celebrate that day, the hou&s;e in which they were was a&s;&s;auited, and the windows were broken by the rabble: That this a&s;&s;ault was the beginning and occa&s;ion of the riots that en&s;ued: That the conduct of the major &s;eemed well ju&s;tified by the affidavits produced on his part: That the printing and publi&s;hing the depo&s;itions, upon which the complaints relating to the riots at Oxford, were founded, while that matter was under the exami|nation<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of the lords of the committee of the council, and before they had time to come to any re&s;olution touching the &s;ame, was irregular, di&s;re&s;pectful to his royal highne&s;s, and tending to &s;edition. An inquiry of this nature &s;o managed, did not much redound to the honour of &s;uch an augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly.</P>

<P>The commons pa&s;&s;ed a bill, prohibiting all commerce with Sweden, a branch of trade which was of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the Engli&s;h merchants. They voted ten thou&s;and &s;eamen for the en&s;uing year, granted about a million for the maintenance of guards, garri&s;ons, and land-forces; and pa&s;&s;ed the bill relating to mutiny and de&s;ertion. The hou&s;e likewi&s;e voted four and twenty thou&s;and pounds for the payment of four battalions of Mun&s;ter and two of Saxegotha, which the king had taken into his &s;ervice, to &s;upply the place of &s;uch as might be, during the rebellion, drawn from the garri&s;ons of the &s;tates general to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England. This vote, however, was not car|ried without a violent debate. The demand was inveighed again&s;t as an impo|&s;ition, &s;eeing no &s;uch troops had ever &s;erved. A motion was made for an addre&s;s, de&s;iring, that the in&s;tructions of tho&s;e who concluded the treaties, might be layed before the hou&s;e; but this was over-ruled by the majority <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year was rendered famous by a com|plete vict ry which prince Eugene obtained over the $word$ at Peterwaradin upon the Danube. The battle was fought on the fifth day of Au|gu&s;t. The Imperial army did not exceed &s;ixty thou&s;and men: that of the Infidels amounted to one hundred and fifty thou&s;and, commanded by the grand vizir, who was mortally wounded in the engagement. The Infidels were totally de|feated, with the lo&s;s of all their tents, artillery, and baggage; &s;o that the victors obtained an im|men&s;e booty.</NOTE>. The &s;up|plies
<PB N="457" REF="4600">
were rai&s;ed by a land-tax of three &s;hillings in the pound, and a malt-tax. What the commons had given was not thought &s;ufficient for the expence of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1717.</NOTE> year; therefore Mr. &s;ecretary Stanhope brought a me&s;&s;age from his maje&s;ty, demanding an extraordinary &s;upply, that he might be the better enabled to &s;e|cure his kingdoms again&s;t the danger with which they were threatened from Sweden; and he moved, that a &s;upply &s;hould be granted to his maje&s;ty for this purpo&s;e. Mr. Shippen &s;aid, it was a great misfortune that the king was as little acquainted with the parliamentary proceedings as with the language of the country: that the me&s;&s;age was unparliamentary and unprecedented; and, in his opinion, penned by &s;ome foreign mini&s;ter: he had been often told, that his maje&s;ty had retrieved the honour and reputation of the nation; a truth which appeared in the flouri&s;hing condition of trade: that the &s;upply demanded &s;eemed to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the glorious advantages which his maje&s;ty had obtained for the people. He was &s;econded by Mr. Hungerford, who declared, that for his part he could not under&s;tand what occa&s;ion there was for new alli|ances; much le&s;s, that they &s;hould be purcha&s;ed with money. He expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize, that a nation &s;o lately the terror of France and Spain, &s;hould now &s;eem to fear &s;o incon&s;iderable an enemy as the king of Sweden. The motion was &s;upported by Mr. Bo&s;cawen, Sir Gilbert Heathcote, and others; but &s;ome of the Whigs &s;poke again&s;t it; and Mr. Robert Walpole was &s;ilent. The &s;peaker and Mr. Smith, one of the tellers of the exchequer, oppo&s;ed this unparliamentary way of demanding the &s;upply: the former propo&s;ed, that part of the army &s;hould be di&s;banded, and the money applied towards the making good &s;uch new engagements as were deemed nece&s;&s;ary. After &s;e|veral &s;ucce&s;&s;ive debates, the re&s;olution for a &s;upply was carried by a ma|jority of four voices.</P>

<P>The mini&s;try was now divided within it&s;elf. Lord Town&s;hend had been removed from the office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate by the intrigues of the earl of Sunderland; and he was now likewi&s;e di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the place of lord-lieute|nant of Ireland. Mr. Robert Walpole re&s;igned his po&s;ts of fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea&s;ury and chancellor of the exchequer; and his example was followed by Mr. Pulteney &s;ecretary at war, and Mr. Methuen &s;ecretary of &s;tate. When the affair of the &s;upply was re&s;umed in the hou&s;e of commons, Mr. Stanhope made a motion for granting two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds for that purpo&s;e. Mr. Pulteney ob&s;erved, that having re&s;igned his place, he might now act with the freedom becoming an Engli&s;hman: he declared again&s;t the man|ner of granting the &s;upply as unparliamentary and unprecedented. He &s;aid, he could not per&s;uade him&s;elf that any Engli&s;hman advi&s;ed his maje&s;ty to &s;end &s;uch a me&s;&s;age; but he doubted not, the re&s;olution of a Briti&s;h parliament would make a German mini&s;try tremble. Mr. Stanhope having harangued the hou&s;e in vindication of the mini&s;try, Mr. Smith an&s;wered every article of his &s;peech: he affirmed, that if an e&s;timate of the conduct of the mini&s;try in relation to af|fairs abroad, was to be made from a compari&s;on of their conduct at home, they would not appear altogether &s;o faultle&s;s as they were repre&s;ented. <Q>&startq;Was it not a

<P>On the &s;ixth day of May the king going to the hou&s;e of peers, gave the parliament to under&s;tand, that the fleet under Sir George Byng, which had &s;ailed to the Baltic to ob&s;erve the motion of the Swedes, was &s;afely arrived in the Sound. He &s;aid, he had given orders for the immediate reduction of ten thou&s;and &s;oldiers, as well as directions to prepare an act of indemnity. He de|&s;ired they would take proper mea&s;ures for reducing the public debts with a ju&s;t regard to parliamentary credit; and, that they would go through the public bu&s;ine&s;s with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch and unanimity. Some progre&s;s had already been made in deliberations upon the debt of the nation, which was compre|hended under the two heads of redeemable and irredeemable incumbrances. The fir&s;t had been contracted with a redeemable intere&s;t; and the&s;e the public had a right to di&s;charge: the others con&s;i&s;ted of long and &s;hort annuities granted for a greater or le&s;s number of years, which could not be altered without the con&s;ent of the proprietors. Mr. Robert Walpole had projected a &s;cheme for le&s;&s;ening the intere&s;t, and paying the capital of tho&s;e debts, before he re&s;igned his place in the exchequer. He propo&s;ed, in the hou&s;e of commons, to reduce the intere&s;t of redeemable funds, and offer an alternative to the proprietors of an|nuities. His plan was approved; but when he re&s;igned his places, the mini|&s;ters made &s;ome &s;mall alterations in it, which furni&s;hed him with a pretence for oppo&s;ing the &s;cheme. In the cour&s;e of the debate &s;ome warm altercation pa&s;&s;ed between him and Mr. Stanhope, by which it appeared, they had made a

practice of &s;elling places and rever&s;ions. Mr. Hungerford &s;tanding up, &s;aid, he was &s;orry to &s;ee two &s;uch great men running foul of one another: that, however, they ought to be looked upon as patriots and fathers of their country; and, &s;ince they had by mi&s;chance di&s;covered their nakedne&s;s, the other members ought, according to the cu&s;tom of the Ea&s;t, to turn their backs upon them, that they might not be &s;een in &s;uch a &s;hameful condition. Mr. Bo&s;cawen moved, That the hou&s;e would lay their commands upon them, that no further notice &s;hould be taken of what had pa&s;&s;ed. He was &s;econded by Mr. Methuen: the hou&s;e approved of the motion; and the &s;peaker took their word and honour, that they &s;hould not pro&s;ecute their re&s;entment. The money-corporations hav|ing agreed to provide ca&s;h for &s;uch creditors as &s;hould be willing to receive their principal, the hou&s;e came to certain re&s;olutions, on which were founded the three bills that pa&s;&s;ed into laws, under the names of <Q>&startq;The South-&s;ea act, the Bank act, and the General-fund act.&endq;</Q> The original &s;tock of the South-&s;ea company did not exceed nine millions four hundred and &s;eventy-one thou&s;and three hundred and twenty-five pounds; but the funds granted being &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the intere&s;t of ten millions at &s;ix per cent. the company made up that &s;um to the government, for which they received &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds yearly, and eight thou&s;and pounds a-year for management. By this act they declared them&s;elves willing to receive five hundred thou&s;and pounds, and the eight thou&s;and for management. It was enacted, That the company &s;hould continue a corporation, until the redemption of their annuity, towards which not le&s;s than a million &s;hould be payed at a time. They were likewi&s;e required to advance a &s;um not exceeding two millions, towards di&s;|charging the principal and intere&s;t, due on the four lottery funds of the ninth and tenth years of queen Anne. By the bank-act the governors and company declared them&s;elves willing to accept an annuity of eighty-eight thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-one pounds, &s;even &s;hillings, and ten pence halfpenny, or the principal of one million &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-five thou&s;and twenty-&s;even pounds, &s;eventeen &s;hillings, and ten-pence halfpenny, in lieu of the pre&s;ent an|nuity, amounting to one hundred and &s;ix thou&s;and five hundred and one pounds, thirteen &s;hillings, and five pence. They likewi&s;e declared them&s;elves willing to di&s;charge, and deliver up to be cancelled, as many exchequer-bills as amounted to two millions, and to accept of an annuity of one hundred thou|&s;and pounds, being after the rate of five per cent. redeemable after one year's notice; to circulate the remaining exchequer-bills at three per cent. and one penny per day. It was enacted, That the former allowances &s;hould be conti|nued to Chri&s;tmas, and then the bank &s;hould have for circulating the two mil|lions five hundred and &s;ixty-one thou&s;and and twenty-five pounds remaining exchequer-bills, an annuity of &s;eventy-&s;ix thou&s;and eight hundred and thirty pounds fifteen &s;hillings, at the rate of three pounds per cent. till redeemed, over and above the one penny a-day for intere&s;t. By the &s;ame act the bank was required to advance a &s;um not exceeding two millions five hundred thou|&s;and pounds, towards di&s;charging the national debt, if wanted, on condition, that they &s;hould have five pounds per cent. for as much as they might advance, redeemable by parliament. The general-fund act recited the &s;everal acts of parliament, for e&s;tabli&s;hing the four lotteries in the ninth and tenth years of the

<P>The e$rl of Oxford, who had now remained almo&s;t two years a pri|&s;oner in the Tower, pre&s;en$ed a petition to the hou&s;e of lords, praying, that his impri&s;onment might not be indefinite. Some of the Tory lords affirmed, that the impeachment was de&s;troyed and determined by the prorogation of par|l$ament, which &s;uper&s;eded the whole proceedings; but the contrary was voted by a con&s;iderable majority. The thirteenth day of June was fixed for the trial; and the hou&s;e of commons made acquainted with this determination. The commons appointed a committee to inquire into the &s;tate of the earl's im|peachment; and, in con&s;equence of their report, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the lords, de|manding longer time to prepare for the trial. Accordingly the day was prolonged to the twenty-fourth of June; and the commons appointed the committee, with four other members, to be the managers for making good the articles of impeachment. At the appointed time the peers repaired to the court in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, where lord Cowper pre&s;ided as lord-&s;teward. The commons were a&s;&s;embled as a committee of the whole hou&s;e: the king, the re&s;t of the royal family, and the foreign mini&s;ters, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the &s;olemnity: the earl of Oxford was brought from the Tower: the articles of impeachment were read, with his an&s;wers, and the replication of the commons. Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll &s;tanding up to make good the fir&s;t article, lord Harcourt &s;ignified to their lord&s;hips, that he had a mot$on to make, and they adjourned to their own hou&s;e. There he repre&s;ented, that a great deal of time would be unnece&s;&s;arily con&s;umed in go|ing through all the articles of the impeachment: that if the commons would make go$d the two articles for $igh-trea&s;on, the earl of Oxford would forfeit both l$fe and e&s;tate, and there would be an end of the matter: whereas, to proceed on the method propo&s;ed by the commons, would draw the trial on to a prodig$ous length. He therefore moved, that the commons might not be ad|mitted to pr$ceed, until judgment &s;hould be fir&s;t given upon the articles for high-trea&s;on. He was &s;upported by th$ earls of Angle&s;ey and Nottingham, the lord
<PB N="461" REF="4640">
Trevor, and a con&s;iderable number of both part$es; and though oppo&s;ed by the earl of Sunderland, the lords Coning&s;by, and Parker, the mo$ion was carried in the a$$irmative. It produced a di&s;pute between the two hou&s;es. The commons, at a con$er$$ce, delivered a paper, containing their rea&s;ons for a&s;&s;erting it as their undoubted right to impeach a pe$r either for tr$$&s;on, or for high crimes and mi&s;demeanours; or, &s;hould they &s;ee occa&s;ion, to mix both in the &s;ame accu&s;ation. The hou&s;e of lords in&s;i&s;ted on their former re&s;olut$$n; and, $n another con$erence deliv$r$d a paper, wherein th$y a&s;&s;erted it to be $ right i$$$$rent in every court of ju&s;tice, to order and direct &s;uch methods of proceeding $s it &s;hould think fit to be ob&s;erved in all cau&s;es that fall under its cognizan$e. The commons de|mand$d a free conference, which was refu&s;ed. The $$$pu$$ grew more and more warm. The lords &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the lower hou&s;e, importing, that they intended pre&s;ently to proceed on the trial of the earl of Oxford. They com|mons payed no regard to this intimation; but adjourned to the third day of July. The lords rep$$ring to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, took their places, ordered the earl to be brought to the bar, and made proclamation for his accu&s;ers to appear. Having w$$ted a quarter of an hour, they adjourned to their own hou&s;e, where, after &s;o$e debate, the earl was acquitted upon a divi&s;ion: then returning to the hall, they voted, That he &s;hould be &s;et at liberty. Oxford owed his &s;afety to the di&s;&s;en&s;ions among the mini&s;ters, and to the late change in the admini&s;tration, in con&s;equence of which he was delivered from the per&s;ecution of Walpole; and numbered among his friend$ the dukes of Devon&s;hire and Argyle, the earls of Nottingham and Ilay, and the lord Town&s;hend. The commons, in order to expre&s;s their &s;en&s;e of his $emerit, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring he might be excepted out of the intended act of grace. The king promi&s;ed to comply with their reque&s;t; and in the mean time forbade the earl to appear at court. On the fifteenth day of July the earl of Sunderland deli|vered in the hou&s;e of peers the act of grace, which pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es with great expedition. From this indulgence were excepted the earl of Oxford, Mr. Prior, Mr. Thomas Harley, Mr. Arthur Moor, Cri&s;p, Nodes, Obryan, Redmayne the printer, and Thomp&s;on, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tors in Newgate, and the clan of Macgregor in Scotland. By virtue of this act, the earl of Carnwath, the lords Widdrington and Nairn were immediately di&s;charged; together with all the gentlemen under &s;entence of death in Newgate, and tho&s;e that were confined on account of the rebellion, in the Fleet, the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, and other pri&s;ons of the kingdom. The act of grace being prepared for the royal a&s;&s;ent, the king went to the hou&s;e of peers on the fifteenth day of July, and having given his &s;anction to all the bills that were ready, clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech on the u&s;ual topics.</P>

which the Pre&s;ervative and the &s;ermon were cen&s;ured, as tending to &s;ubvert all government and di&s;cipline in the church of Chri&s;t; to reduce his king|dom to a &s;tate of anarchy and confu&s;ion; to impugn and impeach the royal &s;upremacy in cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and the authority of the legi&s;lature, to inforce obedience in matters of religion by civil &s;anctions. The government thought proper to put a &s;top to the&s;e proceedings by a prorogation; which, however, inflamed the controver&s;y. A great number of pens were drawn again&s;t the bi&s;hop; but, his chief antagoni&s;ts were Dr. Snape and Dr. Sherlock, whom the king removed from the office of his chaplains; and the convocation has not been permitted to &s;it and do bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ince that period.</P>

<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, the negotiations of the North were con|tinued again&s;t the king of Sweden, who had penetrated into Nor|way, and advanced towards Chri&s;tian&s;tadt, the capital of that kingdom. The czar had &s;ent five and twenty thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians to a&s;&s;i&s;t the allies in the reduc|tion of Wi&s;mar, which he intended to be&s;tow upon his niece, lately married to the duke of Mecklenburg Swerin: but before his troops arrived, the place had &s;urrendered, and the Ru&s;&s;ians were not admitted into the garri&s;on; a cir|cum&s;tance which increa&s;ed the mi&s;under&s;tanding between him and the king of Great Britain. Neverthele&s;s, he con&s;ented to a project for making a de&s;cent upon Schonen, and actually took upon him the command of the allied fleet; though he was not at all plea&s;ed to &s;ee Sir John Norris in the Baltic, becau&s;e he had formed de&s;igns again&s;t Denmark, which he knew the Engli&s;h &s;quadron would protect. He &s;uddenly de&s;i&s;ted from the expedition again&s;t Schonen, on pretence that the &s;ea&s;on was too far advanced; and the king of Denmark pu|bli&s;hed a manife&s;to remon&s;trating again&s;t his conduct on this occa&s;ion. By this time baron Gortz had planned a pacification between his ma&s;ter and the czar, who was di&s;contented with all his German allies, becau&s;e they oppo&s;ed his having any footing in the empire. This monarch arrived at Am&s;terdam in December, whither he was followed by the czarina; and he actually re&s;ided at
<PB N="464" REF="4670">
the Hague when king George pa&s;&s;ed through it, in return to his Briti&s;h domi|nions: but he declined an interview with the king of England. When Gyl|lenburg'$ letters were publi&s;hed in London, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages &s;eemed to favour the &s;upp$&s;i$$on of the czar's being privy to the con&s;piracy. His mini&s;ter at the Eng$$&s;h court pre&s;ented a long memorial, complaining that the king had cau&s;ed to be printed, the malicious in$$nuations of his enemies. He denied his having the lea&s;t concern in the de&s;ign of the Swedi&s;h k$ng. He charged the court of England with having p$$vately treated of a &s;eparate peace with Charles, and even with having promi&s;ed to a$$$&s;t him again&s;t the czar, on condition that he would relinqui&s;h his preten&s;ions to Bremen and Verden. Neverthele&s;s, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed an in$lination to re $word$ the antient good under&s;tanding, and to en|gage in v$gor$$$ mea&s;ures for pro$$$$ing the war again&s;t the common enemy. The memorial was an&s;wered by the king of Great Britain, who a&s;&s;ured the czar he &s;hould have rea&s;on to be fully &s;atisfied, if he would remove the only ob&s;tacle to their mutual good under&s;tanding; in other words, withdraw the Ru&s;&s;ian troops from the empire. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, the two monarchs were never perfectly reconciled.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; II.</HEAD>
<P>The czar made an excur&s;ion to the court of France, where he con|cluded a treaty of friend&s;hip with the regent, at who&s;e earne&s;t de&s;ire he promi&s;ed to recall his troops from Mecklenburg. At his return to Am&s;terdam, he had a private interview with Gortz, who, as well as Gyllenburg, had been &s;et at liberty. That mi$$$ter undertook to adju&s;t all $$fferences between the czar and the king of Sw$d$n within three months; and Peter engaged to &s;u&s;pend all operations again&s;t Sweden, until that term &s;hould be expired. A congre&s;s was opened at Abo, between the Swedi&s;h and Ru$$$an mini&s;ters; but the con|ferences were afterwards removed to Aland. By this convention, the czar obliged him&s;elf to a&s;&s;i&s;t Charles in the conque&s;t of Norway; and they pro|mi&s;ed to unite all their forces again&s;t the king of Great Britain, &s;hould he pre|&s;ume to interpo&s;e. Both were incen&s;ed again&s;t that prince; and one part of their de&s;ign was to rai&s;e the pretender to the throne of England. Baron Gortz &s;et out from Aland for Frederick&s;tadt in Norway, with the plan of peace; but, before he arrived, Charles was killed by a cannon ball from the town, as he vi&s;ited the trenches, on the thirtieth of November. Baron Gortz was immediately ar|re&s;ted, and brought to the &s;caffold by the nobles of Sweden, who&s;e hatred he had incurred by his in&s;olence of behaviour. The death of Charles was fortunate for king George. Sweden was now obliged to &s;ubmit: while the czar, the king of Denmark, and the elector of Hanover, kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they had acquired in the cour&s;e of the war.</P>

<P>Thus Bremen and Verden were &s;ecured to the hou&s;e of Hanover: an acqui&s;ition towards which the Engli&s;h nation contributed by her money, as well as by her arms: an acqui&s;ition made in contradiction to the engagements into which England entered when king William became guarantee for the treaty of Travendahl: an acqui&s;ition that may be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t link of a political chain by which the Engli&s;h nation was dragged back into ex|pen&s;ive connexions with the continent. The king had not yet received the inve&s;titure of the&s;e dutchies; and, until that &s;hould be procured, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to e&s;pou&s;e with warmth the intere&s;ts of the emperor. This was another &s;ource of mi&s;under&s;tanding between Great Britain and Spain. Prince Eugene
<PB N="465" REF="4680">
gained another complete victory over a prodigious army of the Turks at Bel|grade, which was &s;urrendered to him after the battle. The emperor had en|gaged in this war as an ally of the Venetians, whom the Turks had attacked and driven from the Morea. The pope con&s;idered it as a religious war again&s;t the infidels; and obtained repeated a&s;&s;urances from the king of Spain, that he would not undertake any thing again&s;t the emperor, while he was engaged in &s;uch a laudable quarrel. Philip had even &s;ent a &s;quadron of &s;hips and gallies to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Venetians. In the cour&s;e of this year, however, he equipped a &s;trong armament, the command of which he be&s;towed on the marquis de Lede, who &s;ailed from Barcelona in July, and landing at Cagliari in Sardinia, which belonged to the emperor, made a conque&s;t of the whole i&s;land. At the &s;ame time, the king of Spain endeavoured to ju&s;tify the&s;e proceedings by a manife&s;to, in which he alledged that the archduke, con|trary to the faith of treaties, encouraged and &s;upported the rebellion of his &s;ubjects in Catalonia, by frequent &s;uccours from Naples and other places; and that the great inqui&s;itor of Spain had been &s;eized, though furni&s;hed with a pa&s;s|port from his holine&s;s. He promi&s;ed, however, to proceed no farther, and &s;u&s;pend all operations, that the powers of Europe might have time and oppor|tunity to contrive expedients for reconciling all differences, and &s;ecuring the peace and balance of power in Italy: nay, he con&s;ented that this important affair &s;hould be left to the arbitration of king George and the &s;tates-general. The&s;e powers undertook the office. Conferences were begun between the mini&s;ters of the emperor, France, England, and Holland; and the&s;e produced, in the cour&s;e of the following year, the famous quadruple alliance. In this treaty it was &s;tipulated, That the emperor &s;hould renounce all preten&s;ions to the crown of Spain, and exchange Sardinia for Sicily, with the duke of Savoy: That the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the dutchies of Tu&s;cany, Parma, and Placentia, which the queen of Spain claimed by inheritance, as prince&s;s of the hou&s;e of Farne&s;e, &s;hould be &s;ettled on her elde&s;t &s;on, in ca&s;e the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;hould die without male i&s;&s;ue. Philip, di&s;&s;atisfied with this partition, continued to make formidable preparations by &s;ea and land. The king of England and the regent of France inte$po&s;ed their admonitions to no purpo&s;e. At length his Britannic maje&s;ty had recour&s;e to more &s;ub&s;tantial arguments, and ordered a &s;trong &s;quadron to be equipped with all po&s;&s;ible expedition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pretende$, who re&s;ided at Urbino, having received intelligence from Paris, that there was a de&s;ign formed again&s;t his life, pope Clement XI. gave directions that all foreigners in that neighbourhood, e&s;pecially Engli&s;h, &s;hould be $$re&s;ted. The earl of Peterborough arriving at Bologna with a few armed followers, was &s;eized, with all his papers. Being inter$ogated, he &s;aid he came to pa&s;s &s;ome time in Italy, for the benefit of the air. He was clo&s;e confined for a whole month in Fort Urbino, and his at|tendants were &s;ent to pri&s;on. Nothing appear|ing to ju&s;tify the &s;u&s;picion, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with uncommon civility. The king demanding re|paration for this in&s;ult, the pope wrote with his own hand a letter to an ally of Great Britain, declaring, that the legate of Bologna had vio|lently and unju&s;tly, without the knowledge of his holine&s;s, cau&s;ed the earl of Peterborough to be &s;eized upon &s;u&s;picions which proved to be ill grounded. The cardinal-legate &s;ent a decla|ration to the Engli&s;h admiral in the Mediter|ranean, that he had a&s;ked forgivenne&s;s of his holine&s;s, and now begged pardon of his Bri|tannic maje&s;ty, for having unadvi&s;edly arre&s;ted a peer of Great Britain on his travels.</NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="466" REF="4690">
the grandfather and father. The prince of Wales intended that his uncle the duke of York &s;hould &s;tand godfather. The king ordered the duke of Newca&s;tle to &s;tand for him&s;elf. After the ceremony, the prince expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment again&s;t this nobleman in very warm terms. The king ordered the prince to confine him&s;elf within his own apartments; and afterwards &s;ignified his plea&s;ure that he &s;hould quit the palace of St. James's. He retired with the prince&s;s to a hou&s;e belonging to the earl of Grantham; but the children were returned at the palace. All peers and peere&s;&s;es, and all privy-coun&s;ellors and their wives, were given to under&s;tand, that in ca&s;e they vi&s;ited the prince and prince&s;s, they &s;hould have no acce&s;s to his maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence; and all $$o $word$ $word$ and places under both king and prince, were obliged to qu$t the $word$ of one or other, at their option. When the parliament met on the $span$ day of November, the king, in his &s;peech, told both hou&s;es, $span$ the army to very near one half, &s;ince the beginning of the $span$ his de&s;ire that all tho&s;e who were friends to the pre|&s;ent $span$ might unanimou&s;ly concur in &s;ome proper method for $span$ the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, of which, as the church of $span$ was unque&s;tionably the main &s;upport and bulwark, &s;o would &s;he reap $span$ principal benefit of every advantage accruing from the union and mutual charity of all prote&s;tants. After the addre&s;&s;es of thanks, which were couched in the u&s;ual &s;t$$e, the commons proceeded to take into con&s;ideration the e&s;timates and accounts, in order to &s;ettle the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army, navy, and ordnance. Ten thou&s;and men were voted for the &s;ea-&s;ervice. When the &s;upply for the army fell under deliberation, a very warm debate en|&s;ued upon the number of troops nece&s;&s;ary to be maintained. Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Shippen, and Mr. Walpole, in a long elaborate harrangue, $word$ upon its being reduced to twelve thou&s;and. They were an&s;wered by Mr. $word$ $word$ at war, and Sir David Dalrymple. Mr. Shippen, in the courte of the debate, &s;aid the &s;econd paragraph of the king's &s;peech &s;eemed rather to be calculated for the meridian of Germany than for Great Britain; and it was a great misfortune that the king was a &s;tranger to our language and $word$ Mr. $word$ affirmed this was a &s;candalous invective again&s;t the lung's per&s;on and government; and moved that he &s;hould be &s;ent to $word$ $$wer.

<P>On account of the great &s;carcity of &s;ilver coin, occa&s;ioned by the expor|tation of $$$ver and the imp$$tation of gold, a motion was made to put a &s;top to the growing $span$ the value of gold &s;pecies.

His maje&s;ty complied
<PB N="467" REF="4700">
with their reque&s;t: but people hoarding up their &s;ilver, in hope that the price of it would be rai&s;ed; or in apprehen&s;ion that the gold would be lowered &s;till farther, the two hou&s;es re&s;olved that the &s;tandard of the gold and &s;ilver coins of the kingdom &s;hould not be altered in finene&s;s, weight, or denomina|tion; and they ordered a bill to be brought in to prevent the melting down of the &s;ilver coin. At this period, one James Shepherd, a youth of eighteen, appretence to a coachmaker, and an enthu&s;ia&s;t in Jacobiti&s;m, &s;ent a letter to a nonjuring clergyman, propo&s;ing a &s;cheme for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating king George. He was immediately apprehended, owned the de&s;ign, was tried, condemned, and executed at Tyburn. This was likewi&s;e the fate of the marquis de Palleotti, an Italian nobleman, brother to the dutche&s;s of Shrew&s;bury. He had, in a tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion, killed his own &s;ervant; and &s;eemed indeed to be di&s;|ordered in his brain. After he had received &s;entence of death, the king's pardon was earne&s;tly &s;ollicited by his &s;i&s;ter the dutche&s;s, and many other per|&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction: but the common people became &s;o clamorous, that it was thought dangerous to re&s;cue him from the penalties of the law, which he accordingly underwent in the mo&s;t ignominious manner. No &s;ubject produced &s;o much heat and altercation in parliament during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, as did the bill for regulating the land-forces, and puni&s;hing mutiny and de&s;ertion: a bill which was looked upon as an incroach|ment upon the liberties and con&s;titution of England, in as much as it e&s;ta|bli&s;hed martial law, which wre&s;ted from the civil magi&s;trate the cognizance of crimes and mi&s;demeanours committed by the &s;oldiers and officers of the army: a juri&s;diction incon&s;i&s;tent with the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of the people. The dangers that might accrue from &s;uch a power were explained in the lower hou&s;e by Mr. Hutchin&s;on, Mr. Harley, and Mr. Robert Walpole, which la&s;t, however, voted afterwards for the bill. In the hou&s;e of lords, it was &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the earls of Oxford, Strafford, and lord Harcourt. Their objections were an&s;wered by lord Carteret. The bill pa&s;&s;ed by a great majority; but divers lords entered a prote&s;t. This affair being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, a bill was brought in for ve&s;ting in tru&s;tees the forfeited e&s;tates in Britain and Ireland, to be &s;old for the u&s;e of the public; for giving relief to lawful cre|ditors, by determining the claims; and for the more effectual bringing into<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon.

The time of claiming was prolonged: the &s;um of twenty thou&s;and pounds was re&s;erved out of the &s;ale of the e&s;tates in Scotland, for erecting &s;chools; and eight thou&s;and pounds for building barracks in that kingdom. The king having &s;ignified, by a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e of commons, that he had lately received &s;uch information from abroad, as gave rea&s;on to believe that a naval force, employed where it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, would give weight to his en|deavours: he therefore thought fit to acquaint the hou&s;e with this circum|&s;tance, not doubting but that in ca&s;e he &s;hould be obliged, at this critical juncture, to exceed the number of men granted this year for the &s;ea-&s;ervice, the hou&s;e would provide for &s;uch exceeding. The commons immediately drew up and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, a&s;&s;uring his maje&s;ty that they would make good &s;uch exceedings of &s;eamen as he &s;hould find nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the tranquil|lity of Europe. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of March the king went to the hou&s;e

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> The king of Spain, by the care and indefatigable diligence of his prime min&s;ter cardinal Alberon$, equipped a very formidable armament, $$ich in the beginning of June, &s;et &s;ail from Barcelona towards Italy; but the $word$ of it was not known. A &s;trong &s;quadron having been fitted out in $word$ the marquis de Monteleone amba&s;&s;ador from $pain, pre&s;ented a memorial to the Br$t$$h mini&s;try, importing, that &s;o powerful an armament in time of peace could not but give umbrage to the king his ma&s;ter, and alter the good $word$ that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two crowns. In an&s;wer to this repre&s;entation, the mini&s;ters declared, that the king intended to &s;end admiral B$ng with a powerful &s;quadron into the Mediterranean, to maintain the neu|tr$$$ty in Ita$$. M$$n while, the negotiations between the English and French mini&s;ters produced the quadruple alliance, by which king George and the re|gent pre&s;cribed a peace between the emperor$ the king of Spain, and the king of Sicily$ and undertock to compel Philip and the Savoyard to &s;ubmit to &s;uch conditions as they had concerted with the emperor. The&s;e powers were allowed only three months to con&s;ider the articles, and declare whether they would re$$$t them, or acquie&s;ce in the partition. Nothing could be more con|tradictory to the true intere&s;t of Great-Britain than this treaty, which de&s;troyed the balance in Italy, by throwing &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion of power into the hands of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; interrupted the commerce with Spain; involved the king|dom in an immediate war with that monarchy; and gave ri&s;e to all the quar|rels and di&s;putes which have ari&s;en between England and Spain in the &s;equel. The &s;tates-general did not approve of &s;uch violent mea&s;ures, and for &s;ome time kept aloof; but at length they acceded to the quadruple alliance, which inde$d was no other than a very expen&s;ive compliment to the emperor, who was de&s;irous of adding Sicily to his other Italian dominions.</P>

<P>The king of England had u&s;ed &s;ome endeavours to compromi&s;e the difference between his Imperial maje&s;ty and the Spani&s;h branch of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. Lord Stanhope had been &s;ent to Madrid with a plan of pacification, which being rejected by Philip, as partial and iniquitous, the king determined to &s;upport his mediation by force of arms. Sir George Byng &s;ailed from Spithead on the fourth day of June, with twenty &s;hips of the line, two fire|&s;hips, two bomb-ve&s;&s;els, and ample in&s;tructions how to act on all emergencies. He arrived off cape St Vincent on the thirtieth day of the month, when he di&s;patched his &s;ecretary to Cadiz with a letter to colonel Stanhope the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter at Madrid, de&s;iring him to inform his mo&s;t catholic maje&s;ty of the ad|miral's arrival in tho&s;e parts, and lay before him this article of his in&s;tructions: <Q>&startq;You are to make in&s;tances with both parties to cea&s;e from u&s;ing any further a$ts of h$&s;tility: but in ca&s;e the Spaniards do &s;till in&s;i&s;t, with their &s;hips of war and forces, to attack the kingdom of Naples, or other the territories of

the emperor in Italy, or to land in any part of Italy, which can only be with a de&s;ign to invade the emperor's dominions, again&s;t whom only they have declared war by invading Sardinia; or if they &s;hould endeavour to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the kingdom of Sicily, which mu&s;t be with a de&s;ign to invade the kingdom of Naples; in which ca&s;e you are, with all your power, to hinder and ob&s;truct the &s;ame. If it &s;hould &s;o happen, that at your ar|rival, with our fleet under your command, in the Mediterranean, the Spa|niards &s;hould already have landed any troops in Italy, in order to invade the emperor's territories, you &s;hall endeavour amicably to di&s;&s;uade them from per&s;evering in &s;uch an attempt, and offer them your a&s;&s;i&s;tance to help them to withdraw their troops, and put an end to all further acts of ho&s;tility. But, in ca&s;e the&s;e your friendly endeavours &s;hould prove in|effectual, you &s;hall, by keeping company with, or intercepting their &s;hips or convoy; or, if it be nece&s;&s;ary, by openly oppo&s;ing them, defend the empe|ror's territories from any further attempt.&endq;</Q> When cardinal Alberoni pe|ru&s;ed the&s;e in&s;tructions, he told colonel Stanhope with &s;ome warmth, that his ma&s;ter would run all hazards, and even &s;uffer him&s;elf to be driven out of Spain, rather than recall his troops, or con&s;ent to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms. He &s;aid the Spaniards were not to be frightened; and he was &s;o well convinced that the fleet would do their duty, that in ca&s;e of their being attacked by admiral Byng, he &s;hould be in no pain for the &s;ucce&s;s. Mr. Stanhope pre&s;enting him with a li&s;t of the Briti&s;h &s;quadron, he threw it upon the ground with great emotion. He promi&s;ed, however, to lay the admiral's letters before the king, and to let the envoy know his maje&s;ty's re&s;olution. Such an interpo&s;ition could not but be very provoking to the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter, who had layed his account with the conque&s;t of Sicily, and for that purpo&s;e prepared an armament which was al|together &s;urpri&s;ing, con&s;idering the late &s;hattered condition of the Spani&s;h af|fairs. He &s;eems to have put too much confidence in the &s;trength of the Spani&s;h fleet. In a few days he &s;ent back the admiral's letter to Mr. Stanhope, with a note under it, importing, that the chevalier Byng might execute the orders he had received from the king his ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>The admiral, in pa&s;&s;ing by Gibraltar, was joined by vice-admiral Cornwal with two &s;hips. He proceeded to Minorca, where he relieved the garri&s;on of Portmahon. Then he &s;ailed for Naples, where he arrived on the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, and was received as a deliverer: for the Neapolitans had been under the utmo&s;t terror of an inva&s;ion from the Spaniards. Sir George Byng received intelligence from the viceroy count Daun, who treated him with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of re&s;pect, that the Spani&s;h army amounting to thirty thou&s;and men, commanded by the marquis de Lede, had landed in Si|cily, reduced Palermo and Me&s;&s;ina, and were then employed in the &s;iege of the citadel belonging to this la&s;t city: that the Piedmonte&s;e garri&s;on would be obliged to &s;urrender, if not &s;peedily relieved: that an alliance was upon the carpet between the emperor and the king of Sicily, which la&s;t had de&s;ired the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Imperial troops, and agreed to receive them into the citadel of Me&s;&s;ina. The admiral immediately re&s;olved to &s;ail thither, and took under his convoy a reinforcement of two thou&s;and Germans for the citadel, under the command of general Wetzel. He forthwith &s;ailed from Naples, and on the ninth day of Augu&s;t was in &s;ight of the Faro of Me&s;&s;ina. He di&s;patched his
<PB N="4$0" REF="4730">
own captain with a polite me&s;&s;age to the marquis de Lede, propo&s;ing a ce&s;&s;a|tion of arms in Sicily for two months, that the powers of Europe might have time to concert mea&s;ures for re&s;toring a la&s;ting peace; and declaring, that &s;hould this propo&s;al be rejected, he would, in pur&s;uance of his in&s;tructions, u&s;e all his force to prevent further attempts to di&s;turb the dominions his ma&s;ter had engaged to de$end. The Spani&s;h general an&s;wered, that he had no powers to trea$, con&s;equently could not agree to an armi&s;tice, but &s;hould obey his orders, which directed him to reduce Sicily for his ma&s;ter the king of Spain. The Spani&s;h $$eet had &s;ailed from the harbour of Me&s;&s;ina on the day before the Engli&s;h &s;quadron appeared. Admiral Byng &s;uppo&s;ed they had retired to Ma$ta, and directed his cour&s;e towards Me&s;&s;ina, in order to encourage and &s;upport the garri&s;on in the citadel. But, in doubling the point of Faro, he de&s;eried two Spani&s;h &s;couts, and learned from the people of a felucca from the Calabrian &s;hore, that they had &s;een from the hills the Spani&s;h fleet lying to in order of batt$e. The admiral immediately detached the German troops to Reggio, under convoy of two &s;hips of war. Then he &s;tood through the Faro after the Spani&s;h &s;couts that led him to their main fleet, which before noon he de&s;eried in line of battle, amounting to &s;even and twenty &s;ail large and &s;mall, be&s;ides two fire&s;hips, four bomb ve&s;&s;els, and &s;even gallies. They were com|manded in chief by Don Antonio de Ca&s;tanita, un$er whom were the four rear admirals Chacon, Ma$$, Guevara, and Cammock. At &s;ight of the Engli&s;h &s;quadron they &s;tood away large, and Byng gave chace all the re&s;t of the day. In the morning, which was the eleventh of Augu&s;t, the rear-admiral de Mar$, with &s;ix &s;hips of war, the gallies, fire-&s;hips and bomb-ketches, &s;e|parated from the main f$eet, and &s;tood in for the Sicilian &s;hore. The Engli&s;h admiral detached captain Walton with five &s;hips in pur&s;uit of them; and they were &s;oon engaged. He him&s;elf continued to chace their main fleet; and about ten o'clock the battle began. The Spaniards &s;eemed to be di&s;tracted in their coun&s;els, and acted in confu&s;ion. They made a running fight, and the ad|mirals behaved with courage and activity, in &s;pite of which they were all taken but Cammock, who made his e&s;cape with three &s;hips of war and three frigates. In this engagement, which happened off cape Pa&s;&s;aro, captain Haddock of the Grafton $$gnalized his courage in an extraordinary manner. On the eighteenth the admiral received a letter from captain Walton, dated off Syra|cu&s;e, intimating that he had taken four Spani&s;h &s;hips of war, together with a bomb-ketch, and a ve&s;&s;el laden with arms; and that he had burned four &s;hips of the line, a fire&s;hip, and a bomb-ve&s;&s;el <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Thi$ letter i$ $word$ deemed a curious $pe|cimen of the $word$ $t$le.</P>

Had the Spaniards followed the ad|vice of rear-admiral Cammock$ who was a native of Ireland, Sir George Byng would not have obtained &s;uch an ea&s;y victory; that officer pr$po&s;ed that they &s;hould remain at anchor in the road of Paradi&s;e, with their broad&s;ides to the &s;ea; in which ca$e the Engli&s;h admiral would have found it a very difficult t$&s;k to atta$k t$em: for the coa&s;t is &s;o bold, that the large&s;t &s;hips could ride with a cable a&s;hore; whereas farther out the currents are &s;o various and rapid, that the Engli&s;h &s;quadron could not have come to anchor, or lie near them in

order of battle: be&s;ides, the Spaniards might have been reinforced from the army on &s;hore, which would have rai&s;ed batteries to annoy the a&s;&s;ailants. Before king George had received an account of this engagement from the admiral, he wrote him a letter with his own hand, approving his conduct. When Sir George's elde&s;t &s;on arrived in England, with a circum&s;tantial account of the action, he was graciou&s;ly received, and &s;ent back with plenipotentiary powers to his fa|ther, that he might negotiate with the &s;everal princes and &s;tates of Italy, as he &s;hould &s;ee occa&s;ion. The &s;on likewi&s;e carried the king's royal grant to the officers and &s;eamen, of all the prizes they had taken from the Spaniards. Notwith&s;tanding this victory, the Spani&s;h army carried on the &s;iege of the ci|tadel of Me&s;&s;ina with &s;uch vigour, that the governor &s;urrendered the place by capitulation on the twenty-ninth day of September. A treaty was now con|cluded at Vienna between the emperor and the duke of Savoy. They agreed to form an army for the conque&s;t of Sardinia in behalf of the duke; and in the mean time this prince engaged to evacuate Sicily: but until his troops could be conveyed from that i&s;land, he con&s;ented that they &s;hould co-operate with the Germans again&s;t the common enemy. Admiral Byng continued to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts in Sicily, during the be&s;t part of the winter, by &s;couring the &s;eas of the Spaniards, and keeping the communication open between the German forces and the Calabrian &s;hore, from whence they were &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. He acted in this &s;ervice with equal conduct, re&s;olution, and activity. He conferred with the viceroy of Naples, and the other Imperial generals, about the operations of the en&s;uing campaign, and count Hamilton was di&s;patched to Vienna, to lay before the emperor the re&s;ult of their deli|berations: then the admiral &s;et &s;ail for Mahon, where his &s;hips might be re|fitted, and put in a condition to take the &s;ea in the &s;pring.</P>

<P>The de&s;truction of the Spani&s;h fleet was a &s;ubject that employed the deliberations and conjecture of all the politicians in Europe. Spain exclaimed again&s;t the conduct of England, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the rules of good faith, for the ob&s;ervation of which &s;he had always been &s;o famous. The marquis de Monteleone wrote a letter to Mr. &s;ecretary Craggs, in which he expo&s;tulated with him upon &s;uch an unprecedented outrage. Cardinal Alberoni, in a letter to that mini&s;ter, inveighed again&s;t it as a ba&s;e unworthy action. He &s;aid the neutrality of Italy was a weak pretence, &s;ince every body knew that neutrality had long been at an end; and that the princes guarantees of the treaty of Utrecht were intirely di&s;charged from their engagements, not only by the &s;can|dalous infringements committed by the Au&s;trians in the evacuation of Cata|lonia and Majorca; but al&s;o becau&s;e the guaranty was no longer binding than $ill a peace was concluded with France. He taxed the Briti&s;h mini&s;try with having revived and &s;upported this neutrality, not by an amicable mediation, but by open violence, and artfully abu&s;ing the confidence and &s;ecurity of the Spaniards. This was the language of di&s;appointed ambition. Neverthele&s;s, it mu&s;t be owned, that the conduct of England on this occa&s;ion was irregular, partial, and precipitate.</P>

S$veral peers ob$$rved, that such an addr$$s was, in effect, to approve a &s;ea-$ight wh$$h m$g$t $e attend$d with dangerous con&s;equences, and to give the $anc$$$n of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly to mea&s;ures which, upon examination, might appear either to cla&s;h with the law of nations, or former treaties, or to be prejudic$$l to the trade of Great Britain: that they ought to proceed with the utmo&s;t caution and ma$ure&s;t deliberation, in an affair wherein the honour, as well as the intere&s;t of the nation were &s;o highly concerned. Lord Strafford moved for an addre&s;s, that S$r George Byng's in&s;tructions might be layed be|fore the ho$$e. $arl Stanhope replied, that there was no occa&s;ion for &s;uch an addre&s;s, &s;ince by his maj$&s;ty's command he had already layed before the hou&s;e the treaties, of which th$ late &s;ea$fight was a con&s;equence: particularly the treaty for a defen&s;ive alliance between the emperor and his maj$&s;ty, concluded at We&s;tmin&s;ter on the twenty-fifth day of May, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixteen; an$ the treaty of alliance for re&s;toring and &s;ettling the public peace$ $&s;$g$ed a$ London on the twenty-&s;econd day of July.

He explained the cau&s;e of h$s own journey to Spain, and his negotiations at Madrid. He added, it was high time to check the growth of the naval power of Spain, in order to protect $$d &s;ecure the trade of the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, which had been v$olently oppre&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards. After a long debate, the motion was carr$ed by a con&s;ider$ble majority. The &s;ame &s;ubject excited di&s;putes of the &s;ame nature in the hou&s;e of commons, where the lord Hinchinbroke moved, that, i$ their addre$$ of thanks, they &s;hould declare their intire &s;atisfaction in $$o&s;e mea$ures wh$$h the king had $lready t$ken for &s;trengthening the pro|$e&s;tant &s;$$ce&s;&s;ion, and e$tabl$&s;hing a la&s;ting t$anquillity in Europe. The members in the oppo&s;ition urged, that it was unparliamentary and unprece|dented, on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;$on, to enter upon particulars: that the bu|&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion was of the highe&s;t importance, and de&s;erved the mo&s;t mature deliberation: that, before they approved the mea&s;ures which had been taken, they ought to examine the rea&s;ons on which tho&s;e mea&s;ures were $ounded. Mr. Robert Walpole affirm$d, that the giving &s;anction in the manner pro|po&s;ed, to the late m$a&s;ures, could have no other view than that of &s;creening mini&s;ters who were con&s;cious of having begun a war again&s;t Spain, and now wanted to make it the parliament's war. He ob&s;erved, that in&s;tead of an in $word$ &s;atisfact$on, they ough$ to expre$s their intire di&s;&s;atisfaction with &s;uch con|duct

as was contrary to the law of nations, aud a breach of the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties. Mr. &s;ecretary Craggs, in a long &s;peech, explained the nature of the quadruple alliance, and ju&s;tified all the mea&s;ures which had been taken. The addre&s;s, as moved by lord Hinchinbroke, was at length carried, and pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty. Then the commons proceeded to con&s;ider the &s;upply. They voted thirteen thou&s;and five hundred &s;ailors; and twelve thou&s;and four hundred thirty$five men for the land-&s;ervice. The whole e&s;timate amounted to two millions two hundred and fifty-&s;even thou&s;and five hundred and eighty-one pounds, nineteen &s;hillings.

<P>On the thirteenth day of December, earl Stanhope declared, in the hou&s;e of lords, that, in order to unite the hearts of the well-affected to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, he had a bill to offer under the title of "An act for "&s;trengthening the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in the&s;e kingdoms." It was accord|ingly read, and appeared to be a bill repealing the acts again&s;t occa&s;ional con|formity, the growth of &s;chi&s;m, and &s;ome clau&s;es in the corporation and te&s;t acts. This had been concerted by the mini&s;try, in private meetings with the mo&s;t eminent di&s;&s;enters. The Tory lords were a&s;toni&s;hed at this motion, for which they were altogether unprepared. Neverthele&s;s, they were &s;trenuous in their oppo&s;ition. They alledged that the bill, in&s;tead of &s;trengthening, would certainly weaken the church of England, by plucking off her be&s;t feathers, inve&s;ting her enemies with power, and &s;haring with churchmen the civil and military employments of which they were then wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Earl Cowper declared him&s;elf again&s;t that part of the bill by which &s;ome clau&s;es of the te&s;t and corporation acts were repealed; becau&s;e he looked upon tho&s;e acts as the main bulwark of our excellent con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, which ought to be inviolably pre&s;erved. The earl of Ilay oppo&s;ed the bill, becau&s;e, in his opinion, it infringed the pacta conventa of the treaty of union, by which the bounds both of the church of England and of the church of Scotland were fixed and &s;ettled; and he was apprehen&s;ive, if the articles of the union were broke with re&s;pect to one church, it might afterwards be a precedent to break them with re&s;pect to the other. The archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury &s;aid, the acts which by this bill would be repealed, were the main bul|wark and &s;upporters of the Engli&s;h church: he expre&s;&s;ed all imaginable ten|derne&s;s for well-meaning con&s;cientious di&s;&s;enters; but he could not forbear &s;aying, &s;ome among that &s;ect made a wrong u&s;e of the favour and indulgence &s;hewn to them at the revolution, though they had the lea&s;t &s;hare in that happy event: it was therefore thought nece&s;&s;ary for the legi&s;lature to interpo&s;e, and put a &s;top to the &s;candalous practice of occa&s;ional conformity. He added, that it would be needle&s;s to repeal the act again&s;t &s;chi&s;m, &s;ince no advantage had been taken of it, to the prejudice of the di&s;&s;enters. Dr. Hoadly bi&s;hop of Ban|gor endeavoured to prove that the occa&s;ional and &s;chi&s;m acts were in effect per&s;ecuting laws; and that by admitting the principle of &s;elf-defence and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, in matters of religion, all the per&s;ecutions maintained by the heathens again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, and even the popi&s;h inqui&s;ition, might be ju&s;tified. With re&s;pect to the power of which many clergymen appeared &s;o fond and &s;o zealous, he owned the de&s;ire of power and riches was natural to all men; but that he had learned both from rea&s;on and from the go&s;pel, that
<PB N="474" REF="4770">
this de&s;ire mu&s;t be kept within due bounds, and not intrench upon the rights and liberties of their fellow-creatures and countrymen. After a long debate, the hou&s;e agreed to leave out &s;ome clau&s;es concerning the te&s;t and corporation-acts: then the bill was committed, and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed. In the lower hou&s;e it met with violent oppo&s;ition, in &s;pite of which it was carried by the majority.</P>

<P>The king, on the &s;eventeenth day of December, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, importing, that all his endeavours to procure redre&s;s for the injuries done to his &s;ubjects by the king of Spain, having proved ineffectual, he had found it nece&s;&s;ary to declare war again&s;t that monarch. When a motion was made for an addre&s;s, to a&s;&s;ure the king they would chearfully &s;upport him in the pro&s;ecution of the war, Mr. Shippen and &s;ome other members &s;aid, they did not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of involving the nation in a war on account of &s;ome g$$vances of which the merchants complained, as the&s;e might be amicably redre&s;&s;ed. Mr. Stanhope a&s;&s;ured the hou&s;e, that he had pre&s;ented five and twenty memorials to the mini&s;try of Spain on that &s;ubject, without &s;ucce&s;s. Mr. Methuen accounted for the dilatory proceedings of the Spani&s;h court in commercial affairs, by explaining the great variety of regulations in the &s;everal provinces and ports of that kingdom. It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that the mini&s;try payed very little regard to the trade and intere&s;t of the nation; ina&s;much as it appeared by the an&s;wer from a &s;ecretary of &s;tate to the letter of the marquis de Monteleone, that they would have overlooked the violation of the treaties of commerce, provided Spain had accepted the conditions &s;tipulated in the qua|druple alliance: that his maje&s;ty the king of Great-Britain did not &s;eek to ag|grandize him&s;elf by any new acqui&s;ition, but was rather inclined to &s;acrifice &s;omething of his own to procure the general qui$t and tranquillity of Europe. A member ob&s;erved, that no body could tell how far that &s;acrifice would have extended; but, certainly it was a very uncommon &s;tretch of conde&s;cen&s;ion. This &s;acrifice was &s;aid to be the ce&s;&s;ion of Gibraltar and Portmahon, which the regent of France had offered to the king of Spain, provided he would accede to the quadruple alliance. Horatio Walpole ob&s;erved, that the di&s;po&s;ition of Sicily in favour of the emperor, was an infraction of the treaty of Utrecht; and his brother exclaimed again&s;t the inju&s;tice of attacking the Spani&s;h fleet before a declaration of war. Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e arguments and objections, the majority agreed to the addre&s;s; and &s;uch another was carried in the upper hou&s;e without a divi&s;ion. The declaration of war again&s;t Spain was publi&s;hed with the u&s;ual &s;olemnities; but this war was not a favourite of the people, and therefore did not produce tho&s;e acclamations that were u&s;ual on &s;uch occa|&s;ions.</P>

<P>Mean while cardinal Alberoni employed all his intrigues, power, and indu&s;try, for the gratification of his revenge. He cau&s;ed new &s;hips to be built, the &s;ea-ports to be put in a po&s;ture of defence, &s;uccours to be &s;ent to Sicily, and the proper mea&s;ures to be taken for the &s;ecurity of Sardinia. He, by means of the prince de Cellamare, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, caballed with the malcontents of that kingdom, who were numerous and powerful. A &s;cheme was actually formed for &s;eizing the regent, and &s;ecuring the per&s;on of the king. The duke of Orleans owed the fir&s;t intimation of this plot to king George, who gave him to under&s;tand, that a con&s;piracy was formed again&s;t his per&s;on and government. The regent immediately took mea&s;ures for watching the
<PB N="475" REF="4780">
conduct of all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons; but the whole intrigue was di&s;covered by accident. The prince de Cellamare intru&s;ted his di&s;patches to the abb&eacute; Porto|carrero, and to a &s;on of the marquis de Monteleone. They &s;et out from Paris in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and were overturned. The po&s;tilion overheard Portocarrero &s;ay, he would not have lo&s;t his portmanteau for an hundred thou&s;and pi&s;toles. The man, at his return to Paris, gave notice to the government of what he had ob&s;erved. The Spaniards being pur&s;ued, were overtaken and &s;eized at Poitiers, with the portmanteau, in which the regent found two letters that made him acquainted with the particulars of the con&s;piracy. The prince de Cellamare was immediately conducted to the frontiers; the duke of Maine, the marquis de Pompadour, the cardinal de Polignac, and many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, were committed to different per&s;ons. The regent de|clared war again&s;t Spain on the twenty-ninth day of December; and an army of &s;ix and thirty thou&s;and men began its march towards that kingdom in January, under the command of the duke of Berwick.</P>

<P>Cardinal Alberoni had likewi&s;e formed a &s;cheme in favour of the pretender. The duke of Ormond repairing to Madrid, held conferences with his eminence; and mea&s;ures were concerted for exciting another in&s;urrection in Great-Britain. The chevalier de St. George quitted Urbino by &s;tealth; and embarking at Nettuno, landed at Cagliari in March. From thence he took his pa&s;&s;age to Ro&s;es in Catalonia, and proceeded to Madrid, where he was received with great cordiality, and treated as king of Great-Britain. An armament had been equipped of ten &s;hips of war and tran&s;ports, having on board &s;ix thou&s;and regular troops, with arms for twelve thou&s;and men. The command of this fleet was be&s;towed on the duke of Ormond, with the title of captain-general of his mo&s;t catholic maje&s;ty. He was provided with declarations in the name of that king, importing, that for many good rea&s;ons he had &s;ent part of his land and &s;ea-forces into England and Scotland, to act as auxiliaries to king James. King George, having received from the regent of France timely notice of this intended inva&s;ion, offered, by proclamation, rewards to tho&s;e that &s;hould appre|hend the duke of Ormond, or any gentleman embarked in that expedition. Troops were ordered to a&s;&s;emble in the north and in the we&s;t of England: two thou&s;and men were demanded of the &s;tates-general: a &s;trong &s;quadron was equipped to oppo&s;e the Spani&s;h armament; and the duke of Orleans made a proffer to king George of twenty battalions for his &s;ervice.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XV.</HEAD>
<P>His maje&s;ty having communicated to both hou&s;es of parliament the repeated advices he had received touching this projected de&s;cent, they promi&s;ed to &s;upport him again&s;t all his enemies. They de&s;ired he would augment his forces by &s;ea and land; and a&s;&s;ured him they would make good the extraordi|nary expence. Two thou&s;and men were landed from Holland, and &s;ix bat|talions of Imperiali&s;ts from the Au&s;trian Netherlands. The duke of Ormond &s;ailed from Cadiz, and proceeded as far as Cape Fini&s;terre, where his fleet was di&s;per&s;ed and di&s;abled by a violent &s;torm, which entirely defeated the purpo&s;ed expedition. Two frigates, however, arrived in Scotland, with the earls Mari&s;|chal and Seaforth, the marquis of Tullibardine, &s;ome field-officers, three hun|dred Spaniards, and arms for two thou&s;and men. They were joined by a &s;mall body of Highlanders, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Donan-ca&s;tle. Again&s;t the&s;e adventurers general Wightman marched with a body of regular troops from
<PB N="476" REF="4790">
Inverne&s;s. They had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;s of Glen&s;hiel; but, at the ap|proach of the king's forces, retired to the pa&s;s at Strachell, which they re&s;olved to defend. They were attacked and driven from one eminence to another till night, when the Highlanders di&s;per&s;ed; and next day the Spaniards &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. Mari&s;chal, Seaforth, and Tulhbardine, with &s;ome officers, retired to one of the we&s;tern i&s;les, in order to wait for an opportunity of being conveyed to the continent.</P>

<P>On the la&s;t day of February the duke of Somer&s;et repre&s;ented, in the hou&s;e of lords, that the number of peers being very much increa&s;ed, e&s;pe|cially &s;ince the union of the two kingdoms, it &s;eemed ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to take effectual mea&s;ures for preventing the inconveniencies that might attend the creation of a great number of peers, to &s;erve a pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; an expedient which had been actually taken in the late reign. He therefore moved, that a bill &s;hould be brought in to &s;ettle and limit the peerage, in &s;uch a manner, that the number of Engli&s;h peers &s;hould not be enlarged beyond &s;ix above the pre|&s;ent number, which, upon failure of male i&s;&s;ue, might be &s;upplied by new cre|ations: that in&s;tead of the &s;ixteen elective peers from Scotland, twenty-five &s;hould be made hereditary on the part of that kingdom; and, that this number, upon failure of heirs male, &s;hould be &s;upplied from the other members of the Scotti&s;h peerage. This bill was intended as a re&s;traint upon the prince of Wales, who happened to be at variance with the pre&s;ent mini&s;try. The mo|tion was &s;upported by the duke of Argyle, now lord-&s;teward of the hou&s;hold, the earls of Sunderland and Carli&s;le. It was oppo&s;ed by the earl of Oxford, who &s;aid, that although he expected nothing from the crown, he would never give his vote for lopping off &s;o valuable a branch of the prerogative, which enabled the king to reward merit and virtuous actions. The debate was adjourned to the &s;econd day of March, when earl Stanhope delivered a me&s;&s;age from the king, intimating, that as they had under con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the Briti&s;h peerage, he had &s;o much at heart the &s;ettling it upon &s;uch a foundation as might &s;ecure the freedom and con&s;titution of parliaments in all future ages, that he was willing his prerogative &s;hould not &s;tand in the way of &s;o great and nece&s;&s;ary a work. Another violent debate en&s;ued between the two factions. The que&s;|tion here, as in almo&s;t every other di&s;pute, was not, Whether the mea&s;ure pro|po&s;ed was advantageous to the nation? but, Whether the Tory or the Whig in|tere&s;t &s;hould predominate in parliament? Earl Cowper affirmed, that the part of the bill relating to the Scotti&s;h peerage was a manife&s;t violation of the treaty of union, as well as a flagrant piece of inju&s;tice, as it would deprive per&s;ons of their right, without being heard, and without any pretence or forfeiture on their part. He ob&s;erved, that the Scotti&s;h peers excluded from the number of the twenty-five, would be in a wor&s;e condition than any other &s;ubjects in the king|dom; for they would be neither electing nor elected, neither repre&s;enting nor<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. $span$ of the $word$.</NOTE> repre&s;ented. The&s;e objections were over-ruled: &s;everal re&s;olutions were taken agreeable to the motion; and the judges were ordered to prepare and bring in the bill. This mea&s;ure alarmed the generality of the Scotti&s;h peers, as well as many Engli&s;h commoners, who &s;aw in the bill the avenues of dignity and title &s;hut up again&s;t them; and they did not fail to exclaim again&s;t it, as an in|croachment upon the fundamental maxims of the con&s;titution. Treati&s;es were writ and publi&s;hed on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion; and a national clamour began
<PB N="477" REF="4800">
to ari&s;e, when earl Stanhope ob&s;erved, in the hou&s;e, that as the bill had rai&s;ed &s;trange apprehen&s;ions, he thought it advi&s;eable to po&s;tpone the further con&s;ide|ration of it till a more proper opportunity. It was accordingly dropped, and the parliament prorogued on the eighteenth day of April, on which occa&s;ion his maje&s;ty told both hou&s;es, that the Spani&s;h king had acknowledged the pre|tender.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1719.</NOTE> The king having appointed lords-ju&s;tices to rule the kingdom in his ab&s;ence, embarked in May for Holland, from whence he proceeded to Hanover, where he concluded a peace with Ulrica the new queen of Sweden. By this treaty Sweden yielded for ever to the royal and electoral hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, the dutchies of Bremen and Verden, with all their dependencies: king George obliged him&s;elf to pay a million of rixdollars to the queen of Sweden; and to renew, as king of Great-Britain and elector of Hanover, the alliances formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between his predece&s;&s;ors and that kingdom. He likewi&s;e mediated a peace between Sweden and his former allies the Danes, the Pru&s;&s;ians, and the Poles. The czar, however, refu&s;ed to give up his &s;chemes of conque&s;t. He &s;ent his fleet to the Scheuron or Bat&s;es of Sweden, where his troops landing to the number of fifteen thou&s;and, committed dreadful outrages; but, Sir John Norris, who commanded an Engli&s;h &s;quadron in tho&s;e &s;eas, having orders to &s;upport the negotiations, and oppo&s;e any ho&s;tilities that might be committed, the czar, dreading the fate of the Spani&s;h navy, thought proper to recal his fleet. In the Mediterranean admiral Byng acted with unwearied vigour in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Impe|riali&s;ts to fini&s;h the conque&s;t of Sicily. The court of Vienna had agreed to &s;end a &s;trong body of forces to fini&s;h the reduction of that i&s;land; and the command in this expedition was be&s;towed upon the count de Merci, with whom Sir George Byng conferred at Naples. This admiral &s;upplied them with ammunition and artillery from the Spani&s;h prizes. He took the whole reinforcement under his convoy, and &s;aw them &s;afely landed in the bay of Patti, to the number of three thou&s;and five hundred hor&s;e, and ten thou&s;and infantry. Count Merci think|ing him&s;elf more than a match for the Spani&s;h forces commanded by the mar|quis de Lede, attacked him in a &s;trong camp at Franca-villa; and was repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of five thou&s;and men, him&s;elf being dangerou&s;ly wounded in the action. Here his army mu&s;t have peri&s;hed for want of provi&s;ion, had not they been &s;upplied by the Engli&s;h navy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Admiral Byng no &s;ooner learned the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the attack at Franca-villa, than he embarked two battalions from the garri&s;on of Melazzo, and about a thou&s;and recruits, whom he &s;ent under a convoy through the Faro to Sche&s;o-bay, in order to reinforce the Imperial army. He afterwards a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a council of war with the German generals, who, in con&s;equence of his ad|vice, undertook the &s;iege of Me&s;&s;ina. Then he repaired to Naples, where he propo&s;ed to count Gallas the new viceroy, that the troops de&s;tined for the con|que&s;t of Sardinia &s;hould be fir&s;t landed in Sicily, and co-operate towards the conque&s;t of that i&s;land. The propo&s;al was immediately di&s;patched to the court of Vienna. In the mean time the admiral returned to Sicily, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;iege of Me&s;&s;ina. The town &s;urrendered, the garri&s;on retired into the citadel, and the remains of the Spani&s;h navy which had e&s;caped at Pa&s;&s;aro, were now de&s;troyed in the Mole. The emperor approved of the &s;cheme propo&s;ed by the Engli&s;h admiral, to whom he wrote a very graciousletter, intimating, that he had
<PB N="478" REF="4810">
di&s;patched orders to the governor of Milan, to detach the troops de&s;igned for Sardinia to Vado, in order to be tran&s;ported into Italy. The admiral charged him&s;elf with the performance of this &s;ervice. Having furni&s;hed the Imperial army before Me&s;&s;ina with another &s;upply of cannon, powder, and &s;hot, upon his own credit, he &s;et &s;ail for Vado, where he &s;urmounted numberle&s;s difficulties &s;tarted by the jealou&s;y of count Bonneval, who was unwilling to &s;ee his troops de&s;tined for Sardinia, now diverted to another expedition, in which he could not enjoy the chief command. At length, admiral Byng &s;aw the forces embarked, and convoyed them to Me&s;&s;ina, the citadel of which &s;urrendered in a few days after their arrival. By this time the marquis de Lede had fortified a &s;trong po&s;t at Ca&s;tro-Giovanne, in the centre of the i&s;land; and cantoned his troops about Aderno, Palermo, and Catanea. The Imperiali&s;ts could not pretend to attack him in this &s;ituation, nor could they remain in the neighbourhood of Me&s;&s;ina, on account of the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions. They would therefore have been ob|liged to quit the i&s;land during the winter, had not the admiral undertaken to tran&s;port them by &s;ea to Trapani, where they could extend them&s;elves in a plentiful country. He not only executed this enterprize, but even &s;upplied them with corn from Tunis, as the harve&s;ts of Sicily had been gathered into the Spani&s;h magazines. It was the &s;econd day of March before the la&s;t em|barkation of the Imperial troops were landed at Trapani.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XIX.</HEAD>
<P>The marquis de Lede immediately retired with his army to Alcamo, from whence he &s;ent his marechal de camp to count Merci and the Engli&s;h ad|miral, with overtures for evacuating Sicily. The propo&s;als were not di&s;agree|able to the Germans; but, Sir George Byng declared, that the Spaniards &s;hould not quit the i&s;land while the war continued, as he fore&s;aw that the&s;e troops would be employed again&s;t France or England. He agreed, however, with count Merci, in propo&s;ing, that if the marquis would &s;urrender Palermo, and retire into the middle part of the i&s;land, they would con&s;ent to an armi&s;tice for &s;ix weeks, until the &s;entiments of their different courts &s;hould be known. The marquis offered to &s;urrender Palermo, in con&s;ideration of a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms for three months; but, while this negotiation was depending, he received advice from Madrid, that a general peace was concluded. Neverthele&s;s, he broke off the treaty, in obedience to a &s;ecret order for that purpo&s;e. The king of Spain hoped to obtain the re&s;titution of St. Seba&s;tian's, Fontarabia, and other places taken in the cour&s;e of the war, in exchange for the evacuation of Sicily. Ho&s;|tilities were continued until the admiral received advice from the earl of Stair at Paris, that the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague had &s;igned the quadruple alli|ance. By the &s;ame courier packets were delivered to the count de Merci and the marquis de Lede, which la&s;t gave the admiral, and Imperial general to un|der&s;tand, that he looked upon the peace as a thing concluded; and was ready to treat for a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities. They in&s;i&s;ted upon his delivering up Pa|lermo; while he urged, that as their ma&s;ters were in treaty for &s;ettling the terms of evacuating Sicily and Sardinia, he did not think him&s;elf authori&s;ed to agree to a ceffation, except on condition, that each party &s;hould remain on the ground they occupied, and expect further orders from their principals. After a fruitle&s;s interview between the three chiefs at the Ca&s;&s;ine de Ro&s;&s;ignola, the Imperial general re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege of Palermo: with this view he decamped from Alcamo on the eighteenth day of April, and followed
<PB N="479" REF="4820">
the marquis de Lede, who retreated before him, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ad|vantageous po&s;ts that commanded the pa&s;&s;es into the plain of Palermo; but count Merci with indefatigable diligence marched over the mountains, while the admiral coa&s;ted along-&s;hore, attending the motions of the army. The Spa|ni&s;h general perceiving the Germans advancing into the plain, retired under the cannon of Palermo; and fortified his camp with &s;trong intrenchments. On the &s;econd day of May the Germans took one of the enemy's redoubts by &s;urprize, and the marquis de Lede ordered all his forces to be drawn out to retake this for|fication: both armies were on the point of engaging when a courier arrived in a felucca with a packet for the marquis, containing full powers to treat and agree about the evacuation of the i&s;land, and the tran&s;portation of the army to Spain. He forthwith drew off his army; and &s;ent a trumpet to the general and admi|ral, with letters, informing them of the orders he had received. Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed on each &s;ide, the negotiations begun, and the conventions &s;igned in a very few days. The Germans were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Palermo; and the Spani&s;h army marched to Termini, from whence they were tran&s;ported to Barcelona.</P>

<P>The admiral continued in the Mediterranean until he had &s;een the i&s;lands of Sicily and Sardinia evacuated by the Spaniards, and the mutual ce&s;&s;ions executed between the emperor and the duke of Savoy, in con&s;equence of which, four battalions of Piedmonte&s;e troops were tran&s;ported from Palermo to Sardinia, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cagliari in the name of their ma&s;ter. In a word, admi|ral Byng bore &s;uch a con&s;iderable &s;hare in this war of Sicily, that the fate of the i&s;land depended wholly on his courage, vigilance, and conduct. When he waited on his maje&s;ty at Hanover, he met with a very gracious reception. The king told him he had found out the &s;ecret of obliging his enemies as well as his friends; for the court of Spain had mentioned him in the mo&s;t honour|able terms, with re&s;pect to his candid and friendly deportment, in providing tran&s;ports and other nece&s;&s;aries for the embarkation of their troops, and in protecting them from oppre&s;&s;ion. He was appointed trea&s;urer of the navy, and rear-admiral of Great Britain: in a little time the king ennobled him by the title of vi&s;count Torrington; he was declared a privy-coun&s;ellor; and af|terwards made knight of the Bath, at the revival of that order. During the&s;e occurrences in the Mediterranean, the duke of Berwick advanced with the French army to the frontiers of Spain, where he took Fort Pa&s;&s;age, and de|&s;troyed &s;ix &s;hips of war that were on the &s;tocks: then he reduced Fontarabi$ and St. Seba&s;tian's, together with Port Antonio in the bottom of the Bay of Bi&s;cay. In this la&s;t exploit the French were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a detachment of Engli&s;h &s;eamen, who burned two large &s;hips unfini&s;hed, and a great quantity of naval &s;tores. The king of England, with a view to indemnify him&s;elf for the ex|pence of the war, projected the conque&s;t of Corunna in Bi&s;cay, and of Peru in South America. Four thou&s;and men, commanded by lord Cobham, were em|barked at the I&s;le of Wight, and &s;ailed on the twenty-fir&s;t day of September, under convoy of five &s;hips of war, conducted by admiral Mighels. In&s;tead of making an attempt upon Corunna, they reduced Vigo with very little difficulty; and Pont-a-Vedra &s;ubmitted without re&s;i&s;tance: here they found &s;ome bra&s;s artillery, &s;mall arms, and military &s;tores, with which they returned to England. In the mean time captain John&s;on, with two Engli&s;h &s;hips of war, de&s;troyed the

That mini&s;ter was per&s;onally di&s;agreeable to the emperor, the king of England, and the re|gent of France, who had declared they would hearken to no propo&s;als while he &s;hould continue in office: the Spani&s;h monarch, therefore, dive&s;ted him of his employment; and ordered him to quit the kingdom in three weeks. The marquis de Beretti Landi, mini&s;ter from the court of Madrid at the Hague, delivered a plan of pacification to the &s;tates: but it was rejected by the allies; and Philip was obliged at la&s;t to accede to the quadruple alliance.</P>

<P>On the fourteenth day of November king George returned to Eng|land, and on the twenty-third opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament with a &s;peech, in which he told them, that all Europe, as well as Great-Britain, was on the point of being delivered from the calamities of war, by the influence of Briti&s;h arms and councils. He exhorted the commons to concert proper means for le&s;&s;ening the debts of the nation; and concluded with a panegyric upon his own government. It mu&s;t be owned he had acted with equal vigour and delibera|tion, in all the troubles he had encountered &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. The addre&s;&s;es of both hou&s;es were as warm as he could de&s;ire. They in parti|cular extolled him for having interpo&s;ed in behalf of the prote&s;tants of Hun|gary, Poland, and Germany, who had been oppre&s;&s;ed by the practices of the popi&s;h clergy; and pre&s;ented to him memorials containing a detail of their grievances. He and all the other prote&s;tant powers warmly interceded in their favour; but the grievances were not redre&s;&s;ed. The peerage-bill was now re|vived by the duke of Buckingham; and, in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition, pa&s;&s;ed through the hou&s;e of lords. It had been projected by earl Stanhope, and eagerly &s;upported by the earl of Sunderland; therefore Mr. Robert Walpole attacked it in the hou&s;e of commons with extraordinary vehemence. Here too it was oppo&s;ed by a con&s;iderable number of Whig members; and after warm de|bates, rejected by a large majority. The next object that engro&s;&s;ed the at|tention of the parliament, was a bill for better &s;ecuring the dependency of Ire|land upon the crown of Great-Britain. Maurice Anne&s;ley had appealed to the hou&s;e of peers in England, from a decree of the hou&s;e of peers in Ireland, which was rever&s;ed. The Briti&s;h peers ordered the barons of the exchequer in Ireland, to put Mr. Anne&s;ley in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands he had lo&s;t by the decree in that kingdom. The barons obeyed this order; and the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of peers pa&s;&s;ed a vote again&s;t them, as having acted in derogation to the king's prerogative in his high court of parliament in Ireland, as al&s;o of the rights and privileges of that kingdom, and of the parliament thereof: they likewi&s;e ordered them to be taken into cu&s;tody of the u&s;her of the black-rod: they tran&s;mitted a long repre&s;en|tation to the king, demon&s;trating their right to the final judicature of cau&s;es; and the duke of Leeds, in the upper hou&s;e, urged fifteen rea&s;ons to &s;upport the claim of the Iri&s;h peers. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e arguments, the hou&s;e of lords in England re&s;olved, That the barons of the exchequer in Ireland had acted with courage, according to law, in &s;upport of his maje&s;ty's prerogative, and with fidelity to the crown of Great-Britain. They addre&s;&s;ed the king to confer
<PB N="481" REF="4840">
on them &s;ome marks of his royal favour, as a recompence for the ill u&s;age they had undergone. Finally, they prepared the bill, by which the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of lords was deprived of all right to pa&s;s &s;entence, affirm, or rever&s;e any judg|ment or decree, given or made in any court within that kingdom. In the hou&s;e of commons it was oppo&s;ed by Mr. Pitt, Mr. Hunger$ord, the lords Mole&s;worth and Tyrconnel; but was carried by the majority, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>

<P>The king's having recommended to the commons the con&s;ideration of proper means for le&s;&s;ening the national debt, was a prelude to the famous South-&s;ea act, which became productive of &s;o much mi&s;chief and infatuation. The &s;cheme was projected by Sir John Blunt, who had been bred a &s;crivener; and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the cunning, plau&s;ibility, and boldne&s;s, requi&s;ite for &s;uch an undertaking. He communicated his plan to Mr. Ai&s;labie, the chancellor of the exchequer, as well as to one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate. He an&s;wered all their objections; and the project was adopted. They fore&s;aw their own private advantage in the execution of the de&s;ign, which was imparted, in the name of the South-&s;ea company, of which Blunt was a director, who influenced all their proceedings. The pretence for the &s;cheme, was to di&s;charge the national debt, by reducing all the funds into one. The bank and South-&s;ea company outbid each other. The South-&s;ea company altered their original plan, and offered &s;uch high terms to the government, that the propo&s;als of the bank were rejected; and a bill was ordered to be brought into the hou&s;e of commons, formed on the plan pre&s;ented by the South-&s;ea company. While this affair was in agita|tion, the &s;tock of that company ro&s;e from one hundred and thirty to near<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. Corbet. Hi&s;t. Reg. Tindal. Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> four hundred, in con&s;equence of the conduct of the commons, who had re|jected a motion for a clau&s;e in the bill, to $ix what &s;hare in the capital &s;tock of the company &s;hould be ve&s;ted in tho&s;e proprietors of the annuities who might vo|luntarily &s;ub&s;cribe; or how many years purcha&s;e in money they &s;hould receive in &s;ub&s;cribing, at the choice of the proprietors. In the hou&s;e of lords the bill was oppo&s;ed by the lord North and Grey, the earl Cowper, the dukes of Whar|ton, Buckingham, and other peers. They affirmed, it was calculated for in|riching<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1720.</NOTE> a few and impoveri&s;hing a great number: that it countenanced the frau|dulent and pernicious practice of &s;tock-jobbing, which diverted the genius of the people from trade and indu&s;try: that it would give foreigners the opportu|nity to double and treble the va&s;t &s;ums they had in the public funds; and they would be tempted to realize and withdraw their capital and immen&s;e gains to other countries; &s;o that Great-Britain would be drained of its gold and &s;ilver: that the artificial and prodigious ri&s;e of the South-&s;ea &s;tock was a dangerous bait, which might decoy many unwary people to their ruin, alluring them by a fal&s;e pro&s;pect of gain to part with the fruits of their indu&s;try, to purcha&s;e imaginary riches: that the addition of above thirty millions capital would give &s;uch power to the South-&s;ea company, as might endanger the liberties of the nation; for, by their exten&s;ive intere&s;t they would be able to influence mo&s;t, if not all the elections of the members; and con&s;equently over rule the re&s;olutions of the hou&s;e of commons. Earl Cowper urged, that in all public bargains the per&s;ons in the admini&s;tration ought to take care, that they &s;hall be more advan|tageous to the &s;tate than to private per&s;ons; but that a contrary method had been followed in the contract made with the South-&s;ea company; for, &s;hould
<PB N="482" REF="4850">
the &s;tocks be kept at the advanced price to which they had been rai&s;ed by the oblique arts of &s;tock-jobbing, either that company or its principal members would gain above thirty millions, of which no more than one fourth part would be given towards the di&s;charge of the national debts. He apprehended, that the re-purcha&s;e of annuities would meet with in&s;uperable difficulties; and, in &s;uch ca&s;e, none but a few per&s;ons who were in the &s;ecret, who, had bought &s;tocks at a low rate, and afterwards &s;old them at a high price, would in the end be gainers by the project. The earl of Sunderland an&s;wered their ob|jections. He declared, that tho&s;e who countenanced the &s;cheme of the South-&s;ea company, had nothing in view but the advantage of the nation. He owned, that the managers for that company had undoubtedly a pro&s;pect of pri|vate gain, either to them&s;elves or to their corporation; but, he &s;aid, when the &s;cheme was accepted, neither the one nor the other could fore&s;ee that the &s;tocks would have ri&s;en to &s;uch a height: that if they had continued as they were, the public would have had the far greater &s;hare of the advantage accruing from the &s;cheme; and, &s;hould they be kept up to the pre&s;ent high price, it was but rea|&s;onable, that the South-&s;ea company &s;hould enjoy the profits procured to it by the wi&s;e management and indu&s;try of the directors, which would enable it to make large dividends, and thereby accompli&s;h the purpo&s;e of the &s;cheme. The bill pa&s;&s;ed without amendment or divi&s;ion; and, on the &s;eventh day of April received the royal a&s;&s;ent. By this act the South-&s;ea company was authori&s;ed to take in by purcha&s;e or &s;ub&s;cription, the irredeemable debts of the nation, &s;tated at &s;ixteen millions five hundred forty-&s;ix thou&s;and four hundred eighty-two pounds, &s;even &s;hillings, one penny farthing, at &s;uch times as they &s;hould find convenient before the fir&s;t day of March of the en&s;uing year, and without any compul&s;ion on any of the proprietors, at &s;uch rates and prices as &s;hould be agreed upon between the company and the re&s;pective proprietors. They were likeewi&s;e authori&s;ed to take in all the redeemable debts, amounting to the &s;ame &s;um as that of the irredeemables, either by purcha&s;e, by taking &s;ub&s;criptions, or by paying off the creditors. For the liberty of taking in the national debts, and increa&s;ing their capital &s;tock accordingly, the company con&s;ented, that their pre&s;ent, and to be increa&s;ed annuity, &s;hould be continued at five per cent. till Mid&s;ummer, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-&s;even; from thence to be reduced to four per cent. and be redeemable by parliament. In con&s;ideration of this and other advantages expre&s;&s;ed in the act, the company declared them&s;elves willing to make &s;uch payments into the receipt of the ex|chequer, as were &s;pecified for the u&s;e of the public, to be applied to the di&s;|charge of the public debts incurred before Chri&s;tmas, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixteen. The &s;ums they were obliged to pay for the liberty of taking in the redeemable debts, four years and a half$s purcha&s;e for all the long and &s;hort annuities that &s;hould be &s;ub&s;cribed, and one year's purcha&s;e for &s;uch long annuities as &s;hould not be &s;ub&s;cribed, amounted on the execution of the act to about &s;even millions. For enabling the company to rai&s;e this $$m, they were impowered to make calls for money from their members; to op$n books of &s;ub&s;cription; to grant annuities redeemable by the company; to borrow money upon any contract or bill under their common &s;eal, or on the credit of their capital &s;tock; to convert the money demanded of their members $word$ additional &s;tock, without, however, making any addition to the comp$ny's
<PB N="483" REF="4860">
annuities, payable out of the public duties. It was enacted, That out of the fir&s;t monies ari&s;ing from the &s;ums payed by the company into the exchequer, &s;uch public debts carrying intere&s;t at five per cent. incurred before the twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixteen, founded upon any former act of parliament, as were now redeemable, or might be redeemed before the twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-two, &s;hould be di&s;charged in the fir&s;t place: then all the remainder &s;hould be applied towards paying off &s;o much of the capital &s;tock of the company as &s;hould then carry an intere&s;t of five per cent. It was likewi&s;e provided, That after Mid&s;ummer, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and twenty-&s;even, the company &s;hould not be payed off in any &s;ums being le&s;s than one million at a time.</P>

<P>The heads of the royal-a&s;&s;urance and London-a&s;&s;urance companies, under&s;tanding that the civil li&s;t was con&s;iderably in arrears, offered to the mi|ni&s;try &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds towards the di&s;charge of that debt, on con|dition of their obtaining the king's charter, with a parliamentary &s;anction for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their re&s;pective companies. The propo&s;al was embraced; and the king communicated it in a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e of commons, de&s;iring their concurrence. A bill was immediately pa&s;&s;ed, enabling his maje&s;ty to grant letters of incorporation to the two companies. It &s;oon obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent; and on the eleventh day of June an end was put to the &s;e&s;&s;ion. This was the age of intere&s;ted projects in&s;pired by a venal &s;pirit of adventure; the natural con&s;e|quence of that avarice, fraud, and profligacy, which the monied corporations had introduced. This, of all others is the mo&s;t unfavourable aera for a hi&s;torian.

<P>By this time an alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive was concluded at Stockholm between king George and the queen of Sweden, by which his maje&s;ty engaged to &s;end a fleet into the Baltic to act again&s;t the czar of Mu&s;covy, in ca&s;e that monarch &s;hould reject rea&s;onable propo&s;als of peace. Peter loudly complained of the in&s;olent interpo&s;ition of king George, alledging, that he had failed in his engagements, both as elector of Hanover and king of Great-Britain. His re&s;ident at London pre&s;ented a long memorial on this &s;ubject, which was an&s;wered by the Briti&s;h and Hanoverian mini&s;try. The&s;e recrimi|nations &s;erved only to inflame the difference. The czar continued to pro&s;e|cute the war; and at length concluded a peace without a mediator. At the in|&s;tances, however, of king George and the regent of France, a treaty of peace was &s;igned between the queen of Sweden and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, to whom that prince&s;s ceded the city of Stetin, the di&s;trict between the rivers Oder and Pehnne, with the i&s;les of Wollin and U&s;edom. On the other hand, he engaged to join the king of Great-Britain in his endeavours to effect a peace between Sweden and Denmark, on condition that the Dani&s;h king &s;hould re&s;tore to queen Ulri$a that part of Pomerania which he had &s;eized: he likewi&s;e pro|mi&s;ed to pay to that queen two millions of rixdollars, in con&s;ideration of the ce&s;&s;ions &s;he had made. The treaty between Sweden and Denmark was &s;igned at Frederick&s;tadt in the month of June, through the mediation of the king of
<PB N="484" REF="4870">
Great-Britain, who became guaranty for the Dane's keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sle&s;|wick. He con&s;ented, however, to re&s;tore the Upper Pomerania, the i&s;le of Rug$n, the city of Wi&s;mar, and whatever he had taken from Sweden during the war, in con&s;ideration of Sweden's renouncing the exemption from toll in the Sound, and the two Belts; and paying to Denmark &s;ix hundred thou&s;and &s;ixdollars.</P>

<P>Sir John Norris had again &s;ailed to the Baltic with a &s;trong &s;qua|dron, to give weight to the king's mediation. When he arrived at Copenhagen he wrote a letter to prince Dolgorouki the czar's amba&s;&s;ador at the court of Den|mark, &s;ignifying, that he and the king's envoy at Stockholm were ve&s;ted with full powers to act jointly or &s;eparately in quality of plenipotentiaries, in order to effect a peace between Sweden and Mu&s;covy, in the way of mediation. The prince an&s;wered, that the czar had nothing more at heart than peace and tran|quillity; and, in ca&s;e his Britannic maje&s;ty had any propo&s;als to make to that prince, he hoped the admiral would excu&s;e him from receiving them, as they might be delivered in a much more compendious way. The Engli&s;h fleet im|mediately joined that of Sweden as auxiliaries; but they had no opportunity of acting again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;quadron, which &s;ecured it&s;elf in Revel. Ulrica queen of Sweden and &s;i&s;ter to Charles XII. had married the prince of He&s;&s;e, and was extremely de&s;irous that he &s;hould be joined with her in the admini&s;tra|tion of the regal power. She wrote a &s;eparate letter to each of the four &s;tates, de&s;iring they would confer upon him the &s;overeignty; and, after &s;ome oppo&s;ition from the nobles, he was actually elected king of Sweden. He &s;ent one of his general officers to notify his elevation to the czar, who congratulated him upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; and this was the beginning of a negotiation which ended in peace, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the tranquillity of the North. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions king George &s;et out from England for his Hanoverian domi|nions; but, before he departed from Great-Britain he was reconciled to the prince of Wales, through the endeavours of the duke of Devon&s;hire and Mr. Walpole, who, with the earl Cowper, lord Town&s;hend, Mr. Methuen, and Mr. Pulteney, was received into favour, and reunited with the mini&s;try. The earls of Dor&s;et and Bridgewater were promoted to the title of dukes; the lord vi&s;|count Ca&s;tleton was made an earl; Hugh Bo&s;cawen was created a baron, and vi&s;count Falmouth; and John Wallop baron and vi&s;count of Lymington.</P>

<P>While the king was involved at Hanover in a labyrinth of nego|tiations, the South-&s;ea &s;cheme produced a kind of national delirium in his Eng|li&s;h dominions. Blunt the projector had taken the hint of his plan from the famous Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi &s;cheme formed by Law, which in the preceding year had rai&s;ed &s;uch a ferment in France, and intailed ruin upon many thou&s;and families of that kingdom. In the &s;cheme of Law there was &s;omething &s;ub&s;tantial. An ex|clu&s;ive trade to Loui&s;iana promi&s;ed &s;ome advantage; though the de&s;ign was defeated by the frantic eagerne&s;s of the people. Law him&s;elf became the dupe of the regent, who transferred the burthen of fifteen hundred millions of the king's $$bts to the &s;houlders of the &s;ubjects; while the projector was &s;acrificed as the $$ape-goat of political iniquity. The South-&s;ea &s;cheme promi&s;ed no commer|cial advantage of any con&s;equence. It was buoyed up by nothing but the folly and rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of individuals, which became &s;o blind and extravagant, that Blunt, with moderate talents, was able to impo&s;e upon the whole nation, and
<PB N="485" REF="4880">
make tools of the other directors, to &s;erve his own purpo&s;es, and tho&s;e of a few a&s;&s;ociates. When this projector found, that the South-&s;ea &s;tock did not ri&s;e according to his expectation upon the bill's being pa&s;&s;ed, he circulated a report, that Gibraltar and Portmahon would be exchanged for &s;ome places in Peru; by which means the Engli&s;h trade to the South-&s;ea would be protected and en|larged. This rumour, diffu&s;ed by his emi&s;&s;aries, acted like a contagion. In five days the directors opened their books for a &s;ub&s;cription of one million, at the rate of three hundred pounds for every hundred pounds capital. Per&s;ons of all ranks crowded to the hou&s;e in &s;uch a manner, that the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cription exceeded two millions of original &s;tock. In a few days this &s;tock advanced to three hundred and forty pounds; and the &s;ub&s;criptions were &s;old for double the price of the fir&s;t payment. Without entering into a detail of the proceedings, or explaining the &s;candalous arts that were practi&s;ed to inhance the value of the &s;tock, and decoy the unwary, we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that by the promi&s;e of pro|digious dividends, and other infamous arts, the &s;tock was rai&s;ed to one thou|&s;and; and the whole nation infected with the &s;pirit of &s;tock-jobbing to an a&s;toni&s;hing degree. All di&s;tinctions of party, religion, &s;ex, character, and cir|cum&s;tance, were &s;wallowed up in this univer&s;al concern, or in &s;ome &s;uch pe|cuniary project. Exchange-alley was filled with a &s;trange concour&s;e of &s;tate&s;|men and clergymen, churchmen and di&s;&s;enters, Whigs and Tories, phy&s;ici|ans, lawyers, trade&s;men, and even multitudes of females. All other pro|fe&s;&s;ions and employments were utterly neglected; and the people's attention wholly engro&s;&s;ed by this and other chimerical &s;chemes, which were known by the denomination of Bubbles. New companies &s;tarted up every day, under the countenance of the prime nobility. The prince of Wales was con&s;tituted go|vernor of the Welch copper company: the duke of Chandois appeared at the head of the York-building company: the duke of Bridgewater formed a third, for building hou&s;es in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. About an hundred &s;uch &s;chemes were projected and put in execution, to the ruin of many thou|&s;ands. The &s;ums propo&s;ed to be rai&s;ed by the&s;e expedients amounted to three hundred millions &s;terling, which exceeded the value of all the lands in Eng|land. The nation was &s;o intoxicated with the &s;pirit of adventure, that peo|ple became a prey to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t delu&s;ion. An ob&s;cure projector pretending to have formed a very advantageous &s;cheme, which, however, he did not explain, publi&s;hed propo&s;als for a &s;ub&s;cription, in which he promi&s;ed, that in one month the particulars of his project &s;hould be di&s;clo&s;ed. In the mean time he declared, that every per&s;on paying two guineas, &s;hould be intitled to a &s;ub&s;cription for one hundred pounds, which would produce that &s;um yearly. In one forenoon this adventurer received a thou&s;and of the&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions; and in the evening &s;et out for another kingdom. The king, before his departure, had i&s;&s;ued a pro|clamation again&s;t the&s;e unlawful projects; the lords-ju&s;tices afterwards di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all the petitions that had been pre&s;ented for charters and patents; and the prince of Wales renounced the company of which he had been elected gover|nor. The South-&s;ea &s;cheme rai&s;ed &s;uch a flood of eager avidity and extrava|gant hope, that the majority of the directors were &s;wept along with it, even contrary to their own &s;en&s;e and inclination; but, Blunt and his accomplices &s;till directed the &s;tream.</P>

<P>The infatuation prevailed till the eighth day of September, when the &s;tock began to fall. Then did &s;ome of the adventurers awake from their delirium. The number of the &s;ellers daily increa&s;ed. On the twenty-ninth day of the month, the &s;tock had &s;unk to one hundred and fifty: &s;everal eminent gold&s;miths and bankers, who had lent great &s;ums upon it, were obliged to &s;top payment and ab&s;cond. The ebb of this portentous tide was &s;o violent, that it bore down every thing in its way; and an infinite number of families was over|whelmed with ruin. Public credit &s;u&s;tained a terrible &s;hock: the nation was thrown into a dangerous ferment; and nothing was heard but the ravings of grief, di&s;appointment, and de&s;pair. Some principal members of the mini&s;try were deeply concerned in the&s;e fraudulent tran&s;actions: when they &s;aw the price of &s;tock &s;inking daily, they employed all their influence with the bank to &s;upport the credit of the South-&s;ea company. That corporation agreed, though with reluctance, to &s;ub&s;cribe into the &s;tock of the South-&s;ea company, valued at four hundred per cent. three millions five hundred thou&s;and pounds, which the company was to repay to the bank on Ladyday and Michaelmas of the en|&s;uing year. Books were opened at the bank to take in a &s;ub&s;cription for the &s;upport of public credit; and con&s;iderable &s;ums of money were brought in. By this expedient the &s;tock was rai&s;ed at fir&s;t, and tho&s;e who contrived it &s;eized the opportunity to realize. But the bankruptcy of gold&s;miths and the &s;word-blade company, from the fall of South-&s;ea &s;tock, occa&s;ioned &s;uch a run upon the bank, that the money was payed away fa&s;ter than it could be received from the &s;ub&s;cription. Then the South-&s;ea &s;tock &s;unk again; and the directors of the bank finding them&s;elves in danger of being involved in that company's ruin, renounced the agreement, which they were under no obligation to per|form. All expedients having failed, and the clamours of the people daily in|crea&s;ing, expre&s;&s;es were di&s;patched to Hanover, repre&s;enting the &s;tate of the nation, and pre&s;&s;ing the king to return. He accordingly &s;hortened his intended &s;tay in Germany, and arrived in England on the eleventh day of November.</P>

<P>The parliament being a&s;&s;embled on the eight day of Decem|ber, his maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed his concern for the unhappy turn of affairs, which had &s;o deeply affected the public credit at home; and he earne&s;tly de&s;ired the commons to con&s;ider of the mo&s;t effectual and &s;peedy methods to re&s;tore the national credit, and fix it upon a la&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;hment. The lower hou&s;e was too much intere&s;ted in the calamity to po&s;tpone the con&s;ideration of that &s;ub|ject. The members &s;eemed to lay a&s;ide all party di&s;tinctions, and vie with each other in promoting an inquiry, by which ju&s;tice might be done to the injured nation. They ordered the directors to produce an account of all their proceedings. Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll moved, that a &s;elect committee might be ap|pointed to examine the particulars of this tran&s;action. Mr. Walpole, now payma&s;ter of the forces, ob&s;erved, that &s;uch a method would protract the in|quiry, while the public credit lay in a bleeding condition. He told the hou&s;e he had formed a &s;cheme for re&s;toring public credit; but, before he would communicate this plan, de&s;ired to know whether the &s;ub&s;criptions of public debts and incumbrances, money-&s;ub&s;criptions, and other contracts made with the South-&s;ea company, &s;hould remain in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. After a warm debate, the que&s;tion was carried in the affirmative, with this addition, <Q>&startq;Unle&s;s altered for the ea&s;e and relief of the proprietors, by a general court of the
<PB N="487" REF="4900">
South-&s;ea company, or &s;et a&s;ide in due cour&s;e of law.&endq;</Q> Next day Walpole produced his &s;cheme to ingraft nine millions of South-&s;ea &s;tock into the bank of England, and the like &s;um into the Ea&s;t-India company, on certain con|ditions. The hou&s;e voted, that propo&s;als &s;hould be received from the bank, and tho&s;e two companies, on this &s;ubject; and the&s;e being delivered, the com|mons re&s;olved, that an ingro&s;&s;ment of nine millions of the capital &s;tock of the South-&s;ea company, into the capital &s;tock of the bank and Ea&s;t India com|pany, as propo&s;ed by the&s;e companies, would contribute very much to the re&s;toring public credit. A bill upon this re&s;olution was brought in, pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent. Another bill was enacted into a law, for re&s;training the &s;ub-governor, deputy-governor, directors, trea|&s;urer, under-trea&s;urer, ca&s;hier, &s;ecretary, and accountants, of the South-&s;ea company, from quitting the kingdom, till the end of the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of par|liament; and for di&s;covering their e&s;tates and effects, &s;o as to prevent them from being tran&s;ported or alienated. A committee of &s;ecrecy was cho&s;en by ballot, to examine all the books, papers, and proceedings, relating to the ex|ecution of the South-&s;ea act.</P>

<P>The lords were not le&s;s eager than the commons, to pro&s;ecute this inquiry; though divers members in both hou&s;es were deeply involved in the guilt and infamy of the tran&s;action. Earl Stanhope &s;aid the e&s;tates of the criminals, whether directors or not directors, ought to be confi&s;cated to re|pair the public lo&s;&s;es. He was &s;econded by lord Carteret, and even by the earl of Sunderland. The duke of Wharton declared he would give up the be&s;t friend he had, &s;hould he be found guilty. He ob&s;erved, that the nation had been plundered in a mo&s;t flagrant and notorious manner; therefore they ought to find out and puni&s;h the offenders &s;everely, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons. The &s;ub and deputy-governors, the directors and officers of the South-&s;ea company, were examined at the bar of the hou&s;e. Then a bill was brought in, di&s;abling them to enjoy any office in that company, or in the Ea&s;t-India company, or in the bank of England. Three brokers were likewi&s;e examined, and made great di&s;coveries. Knight, the trea&s;urer of the South-company, who had been intru&s;ted with the &s;ecrets of the whole affair, thought proper to with|draw him&s;elf from the kingdom. A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued to apprehend him; and another for preventing any of the directors from e&s;caping out of the kingdom. At this period, the &s;ecret committee informed the hou&s;e of com|mons, that they had already di&s;covered a train of the deepe&s;t villainy and fraud that hell ever contrived to ruin a nation, which in due time they would lay before the hou&s;e; in the mean while, they thought it highly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the per&s;ons of &s;ome of the directors and principal officers of the South-&s;ea company, as well as to &s;eize their papers. An order was made to &s;ecure the books and papers of Knight, Surman, and Turner. The per&s;ons of Sir George Ca&s;wel, Sir John Blunt, Sir John Lambert, Sir John Fellows, and Mr. Grig&s;by, were taken into cu&s;tody. Sir Theodore Jan&s;en, Mr. Sawbridge, Sir Robert Chaplain, and Mr. Eyles, were expelled the hou&s;e and apprehended. Mr. Ai&s;lablie re&s;igned his employments of chancellor of the exchequer and lord of the trea&s;ury; and orders were given to remove all directors of the South-$$a company from the places they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed under the government.</P>

<P>The lords, in the cour&s;e of their examination, di&s;covered that large portions of South-&s;ea &s;tock had been given to &s;everal per&s;ons in the ad|mini&s;tration and hou&s;e of commons, for promoting the pa&s;&s;age of the South-&s;ea act. The hou&s;e immediately re&s;olved, that this practice was a notorious and mo&s;t dangerous &s;pecies of corruption: that the directors of the South-&s;ea company having ordered great quantities of their &s;tock to be bought for the &s;ervice of the company, when it was at a very high price, and on pretence of keeping up the price of &s;tock; and at the &s;ame time &s;everal of the directors, and other officers belonging to the company, having, in a clande&s;tine manner, &s;old their own &s;tock to the company, &s;uch directors and officers were guilty of a notorious fraud and breach of tru&s;t; and their &s;o doing was one great cau&s;e of the unhappy turn of affairs, that had &s;o much affected public credit. Many other re&s;olutions were taken again&s;t that infamous confederacy, in which, however, the innocent were confounded with the guilty. Sir John Blunt refu&s;ing to an&s;wer certain interrogations, a violent debate aro&s;e about the manner in which he &s;hould be treated. The duke of Wharton ob&s;erved, that the government of the be&s;t princes was &s;ometimes rendered intolerable to their &s;ubjects by bad mini&s;ters: he mentioned the example of Sejanus, who had made a divi&s;ion in the Imperial family, and rendered the reign of Claudius hateful to the Romans. Earl Stanhope conceiving this reflection was aimed at him, was &s;eized with a tran&s;port of anger. He undertook to vindicate the mini&s;try; and &s;poke with &s;uch vehemence as produced a violent headach, which obliged him to retire. He underwent proper evacuations, and &s;eemed to re|cover; but next day, in the evening, became lethargic, and being &s;eized with a &s;uffocation, in&s;tantly expired. The king deeply regreted the death of this favourite mini&s;ter, which was the more unfortunate as it happened at &s;uch a critical conjuncture; and he appointed the lord Town&s;hend to fill his place of &s;ecretary. Earl Stanhope was &s;urvived but a few days by the other &s;ecretary Mr. Craggs, who died of the &s;mall-pox on the &s;ixteenth day of February. Knight, the ca&s;hier of the South-&s;ea company, being &s;eized at Tirlemont, by the vigilance of Mr. Gandot, &s;ecretary to Mr. Leathes, the Briti&s;h re&s;ident at Bru&s;&s;els, was confined in the citadel of Antwerp. Application was made to the court of Vienna, that he &s;hould be delivered up to &s;uch per&s;ons as might be appointed to receive him: but he had found means to intere&s;t the &s;tates of Brabant in his behalf. They in&s;i&s;ted upon their privilege granted by charter, that no per&s;on apprehended for any crime in Brabant, &s;hould be tried in any other country. The hou&s;e of commons expre&s;&s;ed their indignation at this frivolous pretence: in&s;tances were renewed to the emperor; and in the mean time Knight e&s;caped from the citadel of Antwerp.</P>

<P>The committee of &s;ecrecy found, that before any &s;ub&s;cription could be made, a fictitious &s;tock of five hundred and &s;eventy-four thou&s;and pounds had been di&s;po&s;ed of by the directors, to facilitate the pa&s;&s;ing the bill. Great part of this was di&s;tributed among the earl of Sunderland, Mr. Craggs &s;enior, the dutche&s;s of Kendal, the counte&s;s of Platen and her two nieces, Mr. &s;ecretary Craggs, and Mr. Ai&s;labie chancellor of the exchequer. In con&s;e|quence of the committee's report, the hou&s;e came to &s;everal &s;evere though ju&s;t re&s;olutions, again&s;t the directors and officers of the South-&s;ea company; and a
<PB N="489" REF="4920" MS="Y">
bill was prepared for the relief of the unhappy &s;ufferers. Mr. S$anhope, one of the &s;ecretaries of the trea&s;ury, charged, in the report, with having large quantities of &s;tock and &s;ub&s;criptions, de&s;ired that he might have an opportunity to clear him&s;elf. His reque&s;t was granted; and the affair being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, he was cleared by a majority of three voices. Fifty thou&s;and pounds in &s;tock had been taken by Knight for the u&s;e of the earl of Sunderland. Great part of the hou&s;e entered eagerly into this inquiry; and a violent di&s;pute en&s;ued. The whole &s;trength of the mini&s;try was mu&s;tered in his defence. The majority declared him innocent: the nation in general was of another opinion. He re&s;igned his place of fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner in the trea&s;ury, which was be&s;towed upon Mr. Robert Walpole; but he &s;till retained the confidence of his ma&s;ter. With re&s;pect to Mr. Ai&s;labie, the evidence appeared &s;o &s;trong again&s;t him, that the commons re&s;olved, he had promoted the de&s;tructive execution of the South-&s;ea &s;cheme, with a view to his own exorbitant profit, and combined with the directors in their pernicious practices, to the ruin of public credit. He was expelled the hou&s;e, and committed to the Tower. Mr. Craggs &s;enior died of the lethargy before he underwent the cen&s;ure of the hou&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, they re&s;olved, that he was a notorious accomplice with Robert Knight, and &s;ome of the directors, in carrying on their &s;candalous practices; and therefore, that all the e&s;tate of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, from the fir&s;t day of December, in the preceding year, &s;hould be applied towards the relief of the unhappy &s;uf|ferers<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon. Annals. Hi&s;t. Reg. Polit. State. Deb. in Parl. Tindal.</NOTE> in the South-&s;ea company. The directors, in obedience to the order of the hou&s;e, delivered inventories of their e&s;tates, which were confi&s;cated by act of parliament, towards making good the damages &s;u&s;tained by the com|pany, after a certain allowance was deducted for each, according to his conduct and circum&s;tances.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1721.</NOTE> The delinquents being thus puni&s;hed by the forfeiture of their fortunes, the hou&s;e converted their attention to means for repairing the mi&s;|chiefs which the &s;cheme had produced. This was a very difficult ta&s;k, on ac|count of the contending intere&s;ts of tho&s;e engaged in the South-&s;ea company, which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to relieve &s;ome but at the expence of others. Several whole&s;ome re&s;olutions were taken, and pre&s;ented with an addre&s;s to the king, explaining the motives of their proceedings. On the twenty-ninth day of July, the parliament was prorogued for two days only. Then his maje&s;ty going to the hou&s;e of peers, declared, that he had called them together again &s;o &s;uddenly, that they might re&s;ume the con&s;ideration of the &s;tate of public credit. The commons immediately prepared a bill upon the re&s;olutions they had taken. The whole capital &s;tock, at the end of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty, amounted to about thirty-&s;even millions eight hundred thou&s;and pounds. The &s;tock allotted to all the pro|prietors did not exceed twenty four millions five hundred thou&s;and pounds; the remaining capital &s;tock belonged to the company in their corporate ca|pacity. It was the profit ari&s;ing from the execution of the South-&s;ea &s;cheme; and out of this the bill enacted, that &s;even millions &s;hould be payed to the public. The pre&s;ent act likewi&s;e directed &s;everal additions to be made to the &s;tock of the proprietors, out of that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the company in their own right: it made a particular di&s;tribution of &s;tock, amounting to two millions two hundred thou&s;and pounds; and, upon remitting five millions of the &s;even
<PB N="490" REF="4930">
to be payed to the public, annihilated two millions of their capital. It was enacted, that after the&s;e di&s;tributions, the remaining capital &s;tock &s;hould be divided among all the proprietors. This dividend amounted to thirty-three pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence per cent. and deprived the company of eight millions nine hundred thou&s;and pounds. They had lent above eleven millions on &s;tock unredeemed. Of which the parliament di&s;charged all the debtors upon their paying ten per cent. Upon this article the company's lo&s;s exceeded &s;ix millions nine hundred thou&s;and pounds; for many debtors re|fu&s;ed to make any payment. The proprietors of the &s;tock loudly complained of their being deprived of two millions; and the parliament, in the &s;equel, re|vived that &s;um which had been annihilated. While this affair was in agita|tion, petitions from counties, cities, and boroughs, in all parts of the king|dom, were pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e, crying for ju&s;tice again&s;t the villainy of the directors. Pamphlets and papers were daily publi&s;hed on the &s;ame &s;ub|ject; &s;o that the whole nation was exa&s;perated to the highe&s;t pitch of re&s;ent|ment. By the wi&s;e and vigorous re&s;olutions of the parliament, the South-&s;ea company was &s;oon in a condition to fulfil their engagements with the public; the ferment of the people &s;ub&s;ided, and the credit of the nation was re&s;tored.</P>

<P>DURING the infatuation produced by this infamous &s;cheme, luxury, vice, and profligacy, increa&s;ed to a &s;hocking degree of extrava|gance. The adventurers, intoxicated by their imaginary wealth, pampered them&s;elves with the rare&s;t dainties, and the mo&s;t expen&s;ive wines that could be imported: they purcha&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;umptuous furniture, equipage, and apparel, though without ta&s;te or di&s;cernment: they indulged their criminal pa&s;&s;ions to the mo&s;t &s;candalous exce&s;s: their di&s;cour&s;e was the language of pride, in&s;o|lence, and the mo&s;t ridiculous o&s;tentation: they affected to &s;coff at religion and morality; and even to &s;et heaven at defiance. The earl of Nottingham complained, in the hou&s;e of lords, of the growth of athei&s;m, profanene&s;s, and immorality; and a bill was brought in for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing bla&s;phemy and profane|ne&s;s. It contained &s;everal articles &s;eemingly calculated to re&s;train the liberty granted to nonconformi&s;ts, by the laws of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion: for that rea&s;on it met with violent oppo&s;ition. It was &s;upported by the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, the earl of Nottingham, the lords Bathur&s;t and Trevor, the bi&s;hops of
<PB N="492" REF="4950">
London, Winche&s;ter, Litchfield, and Coventry. One of the&s;e &s;aid, he verily believed the pre&s;ent calamity, occa&s;ioned by the South-&s;ea project, was a $word$ of God on the bla&s;phemy and profanene&s;s of the nation. Lord $word$ replied, <Q>&startq;That noble peer mu&s;t then be a great &s;inner, for he has lo&s;t con&s;iderably by the South-&s;ea &s;cheme.&endq;</Q> The duke of Wharton, who had rendered him&s;elf famous by his wit and profligacy, &s;aid he was not in&s;en&s;ible of the common opinion of the town concerning him&s;elf; and gladly &s;eized this opport$n$t$ of vindicating his character, by declaring he was far from being a $word$ of $$a&s;phemy, or an enemy to religion. On the other hand, he could $word$ but oppo&s;e the bill, becau&s;e he conceived it to be repugnant to the holy $$$pture. Then pulling an old family-bible from his pocket, he quoted &s;e|veral pa&s;&s;ages from the epi&s;tles of St. Peter and St. Paul; concluding that the bill might be thrown out. The earl of Peterborough declared, that though he was for a parliamentary king, yet he did not de&s;ire to have a parliamentary god, or a parliamentary religion; and, &s;hould the hou&s;e declare for one of this kind, he would go to Rome and endeavour to be cho&s;en a cardinal; for he had rather &s;it in the conclave than with their lord&s;hips upon tho&s;e terms. After a vehement debate, the bill was po&s;tponed to a long day, by a con&s;ider|able majority.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; II.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on was far advanced before the &s;upplies were granted; and at length they were not voted with that chearfulne&s;s and good humour which the majority had hitherto manife&s;ted on &s;uch occa&s;ions. On the &s;ixteenth day of June, the king &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e of commons, importing, that he had agreed to pay a &s;ub&s;idy to the crown of Sweden, and he hoped they would enable him to make good his engagements. The leaders of the oppo|&s;ition took fire at this intimation. They de&s;ired to know whether this &s;ub|&s;idy, amounting to &s;eventy two thou&s;and pounds, was to be payed to Sweden over and above the expence of maintaining a &s;trong &s;quadron in the Baltic? Lord Mole&s;worth ob&s;erved, that, by our late conduct, we were become the allies of the whole world, and the bubbles of all our allies; for we were obliged to pay them well for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He affirmed, that the treaties which had been made with Sweden, at different times, were incon&s;i&s;tent and $word$ that our late engagements with that crown were contrary to the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting with Denmark, and directly oppo&s;ite to the mea&s;ures formerly con|certed with the czar of Mu&s;covy. He &s;aid, that in order to engage the $word$ to yield what he had gained in the cour&s;e of the war, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia $word$ to give up Stetin, and the elector of Hanover re&s;tore Bremen and $word$ that, after all, England had no bu&s;ine&s;s to intermeddle with the affairs of the empire: that we reaped little or no advantage by our trade to the Baltic but that of procuring naval &s;tores: he owned that hemp was a very nece&s;&s;ary $$mmodity, particularly at this juncture; but he in&s;i&s;ted, that if due en|couragement were given to &s;ome of our plantations in America, we might be $word$ from thence at a much cheaper rate than from Sweden and Norway. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e arguments, the Swedi&s;h &s;upply was granted; and, in about in three weeks, their complai&s;ance was put to another proof. They $re given to under&s;tand, by a &s;econd me&s;&s;age, that the debts of the civil hit $word$ to five hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds; and his maje&s;ty hoped they would $word$ him to rai&s;e that &s;um upon the revenue, as he propo&s;ed
<PB N="493" REF="4960">
it &s;hould be replaced to the civil li&s;t, and reimbur&s;ed by a deduction from the &s;alaries and wages of all officers, and the pen&s;ions and other payments from the crown. A bill was prepared for this purpo&s;e, though not without warm oppo&s;ition; and, at the &s;ame time, an act pa&s;&s;ed for a general pardon. On the tenth day of Augu&s;t, the king clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, in which he expre&s;&s;ed his concern for the &s;ufferings of the innocent, and a ju&s;t indigna|ton again&s;t the guilty, with re&s;pect to the South-&s;ea &s;cheme. The&s;e profe&s;&s;ions were judged nece&s;&s;ary to clear his own character, which had incurred the &s;u&s;picion of &s;ome people, who whi&s;pered that he was not altogether free from con|nexions with the projectors of that de&s;ign; that the emperor had, at his de&s;ire, refu&s;ed to deliver up Knight; and that he favoured the directors and their ac|complices.</P>

<P>The lords Town&s;hend and Carteret were now appointed &s;ecretaries of &s;tate; and the earl of Ilay was ve&s;ted with the office of lord privy-&s;eal of Scotland. In June the treaty of peace between Great Britain and Spain was &s;igned at Madrid. The contracting parties engaged to re&s;tore mutually all the effects &s;eized and confi&s;cated on both &s;ides. In particular, the king of Eng|land promi&s;ed to re&s;tore all the &s;hips of the Spani&s;h fleet which had been taken in the Mediterranean, or the value of them, if they were &s;old. He likewi&s;e promi&s;ed, in a &s;ecret article, that he would no longer interfere in the affairs of Italy; and the king of Spain made an ab&s;olute ce&s;&s;ion of Gibraltar and Port|mahon. At the &s;ame time, a defen&s;ive alliance was concluded between Great Britain, France, and Spain. All remaining difficulties were referred to a con|gre&s;s at Cambray, where they hoped to con&s;olidate a general peace, by deter|mining all differences between the emperor and his catholic maje&s;ty. In the mean time, the powers of Great Britain, France, and Spain, engaged, by virtue of the pre&s;ent treaty, to grant to the duke of Parma a particular protection for the pre&s;ervation of his territories and rights, and for the &s;upport of his dignity. It was al&s;o &s;tipulated, that the &s;tates-general &s;hould be invited to ac|cede to this alliance. The congre&s;s at Cambray was opened; but the demands on both &s;ides were &s;o high, that it proved ineffectual. In the mean time, the peace between Ru&s;&s;ia and Sweden was concluded, on condition that the czar &s;hould retain Livonia, Ingria, E&s;tonia, part of Carelia, and of the territory of Wyburg, Riga, Revel, and Narva, in con&s;ideration of his re&s;toring part of Finland, and paying two millions of rixdollars to the king of Sweden. The per&s;onal animo&s;ity &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between king George and the czar &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e. Ba&s;tagif, the Ru&s;&s;ian re&s;ident at London, having pre&s;ented a memo|rial that contained &s;ome unguarded expre&s;&s;ions, was ordered to quit the king|dom in a fortnight. The czar publi&s;hed a declaration at Peter&s;burg, com|plaining of this outrage, which, he &s;aid, ought naturally to have engaged him to u&s;e repri&s;als; but, as he perceived it was done without any regard to the concerns of England, and only in favour of the Hanoverian intere&s;t, he was unwilling that the Engli&s;h nation &s;hould &s;uffer for a peace of inju&s;tice in which they had no &s;hare. He therefore granted to them all manner of &s;ecurity, and free liberty to trade in all his dominions. To fini&s;h this &s;trange ti&s;&s;ue of ne|gotiations, king George concluded a treaty with the Moors of Afric, again&s;t which the Spaniards loudly exclaimed.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year pope Clement XI. died; and the prince&s;s of Wales was delivered of a prince, baptized by the name of William-Augu&s;tus$ now duke of Cumberland. A dreadful plague raging at Mar&s;eilles, a pro|clamation was publi&s;hed, forbidding any per&s;on to come into England, from any part of France between the bay of Bi&s;cay and Dunkirk, without certifi|$ates of health. Other precautions were taken to guard again&s;t contagion An act of parliament had pa&s;&s;ed in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion for the prevention of infection, by building pe&s;t-hou&s;es, to which all infected per&s;ons, and all per|&s;ons of an infected family, &s;hould be conveyed; and, by drawing trenches and lines round any city, town, or place infected. The king, in his &s;peech at opening the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, on the nineteenth day of October, intimated the pacification of the North, by the conclu&s;ion of the treaty between Mu&s;covy and Sweden. He de&s;ired the hou&s;e of commons to con&s;ider of means for ea&s;ing the duties upon the imported commodities u&s;ed in the manufactures of the kingdom. He ob&s;erved, that the nation might be &s;upplied with naval &s;tores from our own colonies in North America; and that their being em|ployed in this u&s;eful and advantageous branch of commerce would divert them from &s;etting up manufactures which directly interfered with tho&s;e of Great-Britain. He expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that, with re&s;pect to the &s;upplies, his people might reap &s;ome immediate benefit from the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of affairs abroad; and he earne&s;tly recommended to their con&s;ideration, means for pre|venting the plague, particularly by providing again&s;t the practice of &s;mug|gling.</P>

<P>One of the fir&s;t objects that attracted the attention of the upper hou&s;e, was Law the famous projector. The re&s;entment of the people on account of his Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;cheme, had obliged him to leave France. He retired to Italy; was &s;aid to have vi&s;ited the pretender at Rome, from whence he re|paired to Hanover; and returned to England from the Baltic, in the fleet commanded by Sir John Norris. The king favoured him with a private audience: he kept open hou&s;e, and was vi&s;ited by great numbers of per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality. Earl Coning&s;by repre&s;ented, in the hou&s;e of lords, that he could not but entertain &s;ome jealou&s;y of a per&s;on who had done &s;o much mi&s;|chief in a neighbouring kingdom; who being immen&s;ely rich, might do a great deal more hurt here, by tampering with tho&s;e who were grown de&s;perate, in con&s;equence of being involved in the calamity occa&s;ioned by the fatal imi|tation of his pernicious projects. He ob&s;erved, that this per&s;on was the more dangerous, as he had renounced his natural affection to his country, his al|legiance to his lawful &s;overeign, and his religion, by turning roman catholic. Lord Carteret replied, that Mr. Law had, many years ago, the misfortune to kill a gentleman in a duel; but that having at la&s;t received the benefit of the king's clemency, and the appeal lodged by the relations of the decea&s;ed being taken off$ he was come over to plead his maje&s;ty's pardon. He &s;aid there was $o law to keep any $ngli&s;hman out of his country; and, as Mr. Law was a &s;ubject of Great-Britain, it was not even in the king's power to hinder him from coming over. After &s;ome di&s;pute$ the &s;ubject was dropped, and this great projector pleaded his pardon in the king's-bench, according to the u&s;ual form.</P>

<P>The mini&s;try had by this time &s;ecured &s;uch a majority in both hou&s;es, as enabled them to carry any point without the lea&s;t difficulty. Some chiefs of the oppo&s;ition they had brought over to their mea&s;ures, and among the re&s;t lord Harcourt, who was created a vi&s;count, and gratified with a pen&s;ion of four thou&s;and pounds. Neverthele&s;s, they could not &s;hut the mouths of the minority, who &s;till pre&s;erved the privilege of complaining. Great debates were occa&s;ioned by the navy-debt, which was increa&s;ed to one million &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds. Some members in both hou&s;es affirmed, that &s;uch extraordinary expence could not be for the immediate &s;ervice of Great-Britain; but, in all probability, for the pre&s;ervation of foreign acqui&s;itions. The mi|ni&s;ters an&s;wered, that near two-thirds of the navy-debts were contracted in the late reign: and the parliament acquie&s;ced in this declaration; though, in reality, the navy-debt had been unnece&s;&s;arily increa&s;ed by keeping &s;eamen in pay during the winter, and &s;ending fleets to the Mediterranean and Baltic, in order to &s;up|port the intere&s;ts of Germany. The duke of Wharton moved, that the treaty with Spain might be layed before the hou&s;e. The earl of Sunderland &s;aid it con|tained a &s;ecret article, which the king of Spain de&s;ired might not be made pu|blic, until after the treaty of Cambray &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The que&s;tion was put, and the duke's motion rejected. The earl of Strafford a&s;&s;erted, that as the war with Spain had been undertaken without nece&s;&s;ity or ju&s;t provoca|tion, &s;o the peace was concluded without any benefit or advantage: that, contrary to the law of nations, the Spani&s;h fleet had been attacked without any declaration of war; even while a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter and a &s;ecretary of &s;tate were treating amicably at Madrid: that the war was neither ju&s;t nor politic, &s;ince it interrupted one of the mo&s;t valuable branches of the Engli&s;h commerce, at a time when the nation groaned under the pre&s;&s;ure of heavy debts, incurred by the former long expen&s;ive war. He therefore moved for an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, de&s;iring, that the in&s;tructions given to Sir George Byng, now lord Torrington, &s;hould be layed before the hou&s;e. This motion being likewi&s;e, upon the que&s;tion, rejected, a prote&s;t was entered. They voted an ad|dre&s;s, however, to know in what manner the king had di&s;po&s;ed of the &s;hips taken from the Spaniards. Di&s;putes aro&s;e al&s;o from the bill to prevent in|fection. Earl Cowper repre&s;ented, that the removal of per&s;ons to a Lazaret, or pe&s;t-hou&s;e, by order of the government, and the drawing lines and trenches round places infected, were powers unknown to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, in|con&s;i&s;tent with the lenity of a free government; &s;uch as could never be wi&s;ely or u&s;efully put in practice; the more odious becau&s;e copied from the arbitrary government of France; and impracticable, except by military compul&s;ion. The&s;e obnoxious clau&s;es were accordingly appealed, though not without great oppo&s;ition. Indeed nothing can be more ab&s;urd than a con&s;titution that will not admit of ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary laws and regulations to prevent the dire con|&s;equences of the wor&s;t of all calamities. Such re&s;trictions, in&s;tead of favour|ing the lenity of a free government, would be the mo&s;t cruel impo&s;ition that could be layed on a free people, as it would act in diametrical oppo&s;ition to the great principle of &s;ociety, which is the pre&s;ervation of the individual.</P>

Dr. Atterbury, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, &s;aid he did not know why &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of indulgence &s;hould be allowed to a &s;et of people who were hardly chri&s;tians. He was &s;upported by the archbi&s;hop of York, the earl of Strafford, and the lord North and Grey. A petition was pre&s;ented again&s;t the bill by the London clergy, who expre&s;&s;ed a &s;erious concern le$t the minds of good men &s;hould be grieved and wounded, and the enemies of Chri&s;tianity triumph, when they &s;hould &s;ee &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion made by a chri&s;tian legi&s;lature, to a &s;et of men who renounce the divine in&s;titutions of Chri&s;t; particularly that by which the faithful are in$fiated into his religion, and denominated chri&s;tians. The petition, though pre&s;ented by the archbi&s;hop of York, was branded by the mini&s;try as a &s;editious libel, and rejected by the majority. Then, upon a motion by the earl of Sunderland, the hou&s;e re|&s;olved, that &s;uch lords as might enter prote&s;tations with rea&s;ons, &s;hould do it before two o'clock on the next &s;itting day, and &s;ign them before the hou&s;e ri&s;es.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$22.</NOTE> In the beginning of May, the king is &s;aid to have received of the duke of Orleans, full and certain information of a fre&s;h con&s;piracy formed again&s;t his per&s;on and government. A camp was immediately formed in Hyde-park. All military officers were ordered to repair to their re&s;pective commands. Lieutenant-general Maccartney was di&s;patched to Ireland, to bring over &s;ome troops from that kingdom. Some &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons were ap|prehended in Scotland: the &s;tates of Holland were de&s;ired to have their auxiliary or guaranty troops in readine&s;s to be embarked; and colonel Churchill was &s;ent to the court of France with a private commi&s;&s;ion. The apprehen&s;ion rai&s;ed by this &s;uppo&s;ed plot, affected the public credit. South-&s;ea &s;tock began to fall; and crouds of people called in their money from the bank. The lord Town&s;hend wrote a letter to the mayor of London, by the king's command, &s;ignifying his maje&s;ty's having received unque&s;tionable advices, that &s;everal of his &s;ubjects had entered into a wicked con&s;piracy, in concert with trai|tors abroad, for rai&s;ing a rebellion in favour of a popi&s;h pretender; but that he was firmly a&s;&s;ured the authors of it neither were nor would be &s;upported by any foreign power. This letter was immediately an&s;wered by an affectionate addre&s;s from the court of aldermen; and the example of London was fol|lowed by many other cities and boroughs. The king had determined to vi&s;it Hanover, and actually &s;ettled a regency, in which the prince of Wales was not

included: but now this intended journey was layed a&s;ide: the court was removed to Ken&s;ington, and the prince retired to Richmond. The bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter having been &s;eized, with his papers, was examined before a committee of the council, who committed him to the Tower for high-trea&s;on. The earl of Orrery, the lord North and Grey, Mr. Cochran and Mr. Smith, from Scot|land, and Mr. Chri&s;topher Layer, a young gentleman of the Temple, were confined in the &s;ame place. Mr. George Kelly, an Iri&s;h clergyman, Mr. Robert Cotton of Huntington&s;hire, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Fleetwood, Neynoe an Iri&s;h prie&s;t, and &s;everal per&s;ons, were taken into cu&s;tody; and Mr. Shippen's hou&s;e was &s;earched. After bi&s;hop Atterburry had remained a fortnight in the Tower, Sir Con&s;tantine Phipps pre&s;ented a petition to the court at the Old Bailey, in the name of Mrs. Morris, that prelate's daughter, praying, that, in con&s;ider|ation of the bi&s;hop's ill &s;tate of health, he might be either brought to a &s;peedy trial, bailed, or di&s;charged: but this was over-ruled. The churchmen through the whole kingdom were filled with indignation at the confinement of a bi&s;hop, which they &s;aid was an outrage upon the church of England, and the epi&s;co|pal order. Far from concealing their &s;entiments on this &s;ubject, the clergy ventured to offer up public prayers for his health, in almo&s;t all the churches and chapels of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. In the mean time, the king, at|tended by the prince of Wales, made a &s;ummer-progre&s;s through the we&s;tern counties.</P>

<P>The new parliament being a&s;&s;embled on the ninth day of October, his maje&s;ty made them acquainted with the nature of the con&s;piracy. He &s;aid the con&s;pirators had, by their emi&s;&s;aries, made the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tances for &s;uccours from foreign powers; but were di&s;appointed in their expectations. Neverthele&s;s, confiding in their numbers, they re&s;olved once more, upon their own &s;trength, to attempt the &s;ubver&s;ion of his government. He &s;aid they had provided con&s;iderable &s;ums of money, engaged great numbers of officers from abroad, &s;ecured large quantities of arms and ammunition; and, had not the plot been timely di&s;covered, the whole nation, and particularly the city of London, would have been involved in blood and confu&s;ion. He expatiated upon the mildne&s;s and integrity of his own government; and inveighed again&s;t the ingratitude, the implacability, and madne&s;s, of the di&s;affected; concluding with an a&s;&s;urance, that he would &s;teadily adhere to the con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, and continue to make the laws of the realm the rule and mea&s;ure of all his actions. Such addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented by both hou&s;es as the fears and attachment of the majority may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have dictated on &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion. A bill was brought into the hou&s;e of lords, for &s;u&s;pending the habeas corpus act for a whole year: but they were far from being unanimous in agreeing to &s;uch an unu&s;ual length of time.

the council, and committed to the Tower on &s;u&s;picion of high-trea&s;on. On the &s;ixteenth day of November, the king &s;ent to the hou&s;e of peers the original, and printed copy, of a declaration &s;igned by the pretender. It was dated at Lucca on the twentieth day of September, in the pre&s;ent year, and appeared to be a propo&s;al addre&s;&s;$d to the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain and Ireland$ as well as to all foreign pr$$ces and &s;tates. In this paper, the chevalier de St. George having mentioned the late violations of the freedom of elections; con&s;piracies invented to give a c$lour to new oppre&s;&s;ions; infamous informers; and the &s;$ate o$ $word$ $word$ which he &s;uppo&s;ed every hone&s;t man to be, very gravely propo&s;$$, that if k$$g G$orge would relinqui&s;h to him the throne of Great-Bri$ain$ he would$ in return, $e$tow upon him the title of king in his native $ominions, and invite all other &s;tates to confirm it: he likewi&s;e promi&s;ed to leave to ki$g George his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Briti&s;h dominions &s;ecure, whenever, in due cour&s;e$ his natural right &s;hould take place. The lords unanimou&s;ly re|&s;olved, that this declaration was a fal&s;e, in&s;olent, and traitorous libel; and or|dered it to be burned at the Royal Exchang$. The commons concurred in the&s;e re&s;olutions. Both hou&s;es joined in an addre&s;s, expre&s;&s;ing their utmo&s;t a$toni&s;hment and indignation at the &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;olence of the pretender; and a&s;&s;uring his maje&s;ty$ they were determined to &s;upport his title to the crown with their lives and fortunes. The commons prepared a bill for rai&s;ing one hun|$red thou&s;and pounds upon the real and per&s;onal e&s;tates of all papi&s;ts, or per&s;ons educated in the pop$&s;h religion$ towards defraying the expences occa&s;ioned by the late rebellion and di&s;orders.

<PB N="499" REF="5020">
their enterprize till the breaking up of the camp; and, in the mean time, employed their agents to corrupt and &s;educe the officers and &s;oldiers of the army: that it appeared from &s;everal letters and circum&s;tances, that the late duke of Ormond, the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Orrery, the lord North and Grey, and the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, were concerned in this con&s;piracy: that their acting agents were Chri&s;topher Layer and John Plunket, who tra|velled with him to Rome; Dennis Kelly, George Kelly, and Thomas Carte, nonjuring clergymen; Neynoe the Iri&s;h prie&s;t, who by this time was drowned in the river Thames, in attempting to make his e&s;cape from the me&s;&s;enger's hou&s;e, Mrs. Spilman, alias Yallop, and John Sample.</P>

<P>This pretended con&s;piracy, in all likelihood, extended no farther than the fir&s;t rudiments of a de&s;ign that was never dige&s;ted into any regular form; otherwi&s;e the per&s;ons &s;aid to be concerned in it mu&s;t have been infa|tuated to a degree of frenzy: for they were charged with having made ap|plication to the regent of France, who was well known to be intimately con|nected with the king of Great-Britain. The hou&s;e of commons, however, re|&s;olved, that it was a dete&s;table and horrid con&s;piracy, for rai&s;ing a rebellion, &s;eizing the Tower and the city of London, laying v$olent hands upon the per&s;ons of his mo&s;t &s;acred maje&s;ty and the prince of Wales, in order to &s;ub|vert our pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment in church and &s;tate, by placing a popi&s;h pretender upon the throne: that it was formed and carried on by per&s;ons of figure and di&s;tinction, and their agents and in&s;truments, in conjunction with traitors abroad. Bills were brought in and pa&s;&s;ed, for inflicting pains and pe|nalties again&s;t John Plunket and George Kelly, who were by the&s;e acts to be kept in clo&s;e cu&s;tody during his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, in any pri&s;on in Great-Britain; and that they &s;hould not attempt to e&s;cape on pain of death, to be inflicted upon them and their a&s;&s;i&s;tants. Mr. Yonge made a motion for a bill of the &s;ame nature again&s;t the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter. This was immediately brought into the hou&s;e, though Sir William Wyndham affirmed there was no evidence again&s;t him but conjectures and hear&s;ays. The bi&s;hop wrote a letter to the &s;peaker, importing, that though con&s;cious of his own innocence, he &s;hould decline giving the hou&s;e any trouble that day, contenting him&s;elf with the opportunity of making his defence before another, of which he had the honour to be a member. Coun&s;el being heard for the bill, it was committed to a grand committee on the &s;ixth day of April, when the majority of the Tory members quitted the hou&s;e.

Earl Powlet demon&s;trated the danger and inju&s;tice of &s;werving in &s;uch an ext$aordinary manner from the fixed rules of evidence. The duke of Wharton having &s;ummed up the depo&s;itions, and proved the in&s;ufficiency of them, concluded with &s;aying, that let the con&s;equences be what they would, he hoped &s;uch a helli$h &s;tain would never $ully the lu&s;tre and glory of that illu&s;trious hou&s;e, as to condemn a man without the lea&s;t evidence.

He &s;aid, if &s;uch extraordinary proceedings were countenanced, he &s;aw nothing remaining for him and others to do, but to retire to their country-hou&s;es, and there, if po&s;&s;ible, quietly enjoy their e&s;tates within their own families, &s;ince the lea&s;t corre&s;pondence, the lea&s;t incercepted letter, might be made criminal. He ob&s;erved, that cardinal Mazarin boa&s;ted, that if he had but two lines of any man's writing, he could, by means of a few circum&s;tances, atte&s;ted by witne&s;&s;es, deprive him of life at his plea&s;ure. Turning to the bench of bi&s;hops, who had been generally unfavourable to Dr. Atterbury, he &s;aid, he could hardly account for the inveterate hatred and malice &s;ome per&s;ons bore the learned and ingenious bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, unle&s;s they were intoxicated with the infatuation of &s;ome &s;avage Indians, who believed they inherited not only the &s;poils, but even the abilities of any great enemy whom they had killed in battle. The bill was &s;up|ported by the duke of Argyle, the earl of Seafield, and the lord Lechmere, who was an&s;wered by earl Cowper. This nobleman ob&s;erved, that the &s;tronge&s;t argument urged in behalf of the bill, was nece&s;&s;ity; but, that for his part, he &s;aw no nece&s;&s;ity that could ju&s;tify &s;uch unprecedented, and &s;uch dangerous pro|ceedings, as the con&s;piracy had above twelve months before been happily di&s;|covered, and the effects of it prevented: that be&s;ides the intrin&s;ic weight and &s;trength of the government, the hands of tho&s;e at the helm had been &s;till fur|ther fortified by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the habeas corpus act, and the additional troops which had been rai&s;ed. He &s;aid, the known rules of evidence, as layed down at fir&s;t, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the law of the land, were the birthright of every &s;ubject in the nation, and ought to be con&s;tantly ob&s;erved, not only in the inferior courts of judicature, but al&s;o in both hou&s;es of parliament, till altered by the legi&s;lature: that the admitting of the precarious and uncertain evidence of the clerks of the po&s;t-office, was a very dangerous precedent. In former times it was thought very grievous, that in capital ca&s;es a man &s;hould be affected by &s;imilitude of hands; but here the ca&s;e was much wor&s;e, &s;ince it was allowed, that the clerks of the po&s;t-office could carry the &s;imilitude of hands four months in their minds. He applauded the bi&s;hop's noble deport|ment in declining to an&s;wer before the hou&s;e of commons, who&s;e proceedings in this unprecedented manner, again&s;t a lord of parliament, was &s;uch an in|croachment on the prerogative of the peerage, that if they &s;ubmitted to it, by pa&s;&s;ing the bill, they might be termed the la&s;t of Briti&s;h peers, for giving up their antient privileges. The other party were not &s;o &s;ollicitous about an&s;wering rea&s;ons, as eager to put the que&s;tion; when the bill pa&s;&s;ed, and a prote&s;t was entered. By this act the bi&s;hop was deprived of all offices, benefices, and dig|nities; and rendered incapable of enjoying any for the future: he was ba|ni&s;hed the realm, and &s;ubjected to the pains of death, in ca&s;e he &s;hould return, as were all per&s;ons that &s;hould corre&s;pond with him during his exile. Doctor Fr$$nd the celebrated phy&s;ician, who was a member of the hou&s;e, and had ex|erted him&s;elf &s;trenuou&s;ly in behalf of the bi&s;hop, was now taken into cu&s;tody on &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable practices.</P>

<P>The next object that excited the refentment of the commons, was the &s;cheme of a lottery to be drawn at Harburgh in the king's German domi|nions. The hou&s;e appointed a committee to inquire into this and other lotteries, at that time on foot in London. The &s;cheme was publi&s;hed, on pretence of
<PB N="501" REF="5040">
rai&s;ing a &s;ub&s;cription for maintaining a trade between Great-Britain and the king's territories on the Elbe; but, it was a my&s;terious &s;cene of iniquity, which the com|mittee, with all their penetration, could not fully di&s;cover. They reported, however, that it was an infamous fraudulent undertaking, whereby many unwary per&s;ons had been drawn in, to their great lo&s;s: and, that the manner of carrying it on had been a manife&s;t violation of the laws of the kingdom: that the managers and agents of this lottery had, without any authority for &s;o doing, made u&s;e of his ma|je&s;ty's royal name, thereby to give countenance to the infamous project, and induce his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects to engage or be concerned therein. A bill was brought in to &s;uppre&s;s this lottery; and to oblige the managers of it to make re&s;titution of the money they had received from the contributors. At the &s;ame time the hou&s;e re&s;olved, That John lord vi&s;count Barrington had been notoriou&s;ly guilty of promoting, abetting, and carrying on that fraudulent undertaking; for which offence he &s;hould be expelled the hou&s;e. The court of Vienna having erected an Ea&s;t-India company at O$tend, upon a &s;cheme formed by one Colebrook an Engli&s;h merchant, Sir Nathaniel Gould repre&s;ented to the hou&s;e of commons, the great detriment which the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India company had already received, and was likely further to &s;u&s;tain by this O$tend company. The hou&s;e immediately re&s;olved, That for the &s;ubjects of this kingdom to &s;ub&s;cribe, or be concerned in encouraging any &s;ub&s;cription, to promote an Ea&s;t-India com|pany now erecting in the Au&s;trian Netherlands was a high crime and mi&s;de|meanour: and a law was enacted for preventing Briti&s;h &s;ubjects from engaging in that enterprize. By another act relating to the South-&s;ea company, the two millions of &s;tock which had been annihilated, were revived, added to the capi|tal, and divided among the proprietors. A third law pa&s;&s;ed, for the more effec|tual execution of ju&s;tice in a part of Southwark, called the Mint, where a great number of debtors had taken &s;anctuary, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that it was a privi|leged place. On the twenty-&s;eventh of May the &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed, with a &s;peech that breathed nothing but panegyric, acknowledgment, and affection, to a parliament which had complied with all his maje&s;ty's wi&s;hes.</P>

<P>His maje&s;ty having ennobled the &s;on of Mr. Robert Walpole, in con&s;ideration of the father's &s;ervices, made a good number of church-promo|tions, admitted the impri&s;oned lords and gentlemen to bail, granted a pardon to lord Bolingbroke, and ordered the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter to be conveyed to the continent, &s;et out him&s;elf for Hanover, leaving the admini&s;tration of his king|doms in the hands of a regency, lord Harcourt being one of the ju&s;tices. The king was attended by the two &s;ecretaries, the lords Town&s;hend and Carteret, who were counted able negotiators. The affairs of the continent had begun to take a new turn. The intere&s;ts and connexions of the different princes were become perplexed and embarra&s;&s;ed; and king George re&s;olved to unravel them by dint of negotiation. Under&s;tanding that a treaty was on the carpet between the czar and the king of Sweden, favourable to the duke of Hol&s;tein's preten|&s;ions to Sle$wick, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which the elector of Hanover had guarantied to Denmark, his maje&s;ty began to be in pain for Bremen and Verden. The regent of France and the king of Spain had now compromi&s;ed all differences; and their reconciliation was cemented by a double marriage between Philip's &s;ons and the regent's daughters. The former propo&s;ed new treaties to Eng|land; but in&s;i&s;ted upon the re&s;titution of Gibraltar and Portmahon, as well as
<PB N="502" REF="5050">
upon the king's openly declaring again&s;t the O&s;tend company. His Britannic maje&s;ty was apprehen&s;ive, that &s;hould the emperor be hard pre&s;&s;ed on that &s;ub|ject, he might join the czar and the king of Sweden, and promote their de&s;igns in favour of the duke of Hol&s;tein. On the other hand, all the Italian powers exclaimed again&s;t the treaty of London. The pope had prote&s;ted again&s;t any thing that might have been decided at Cambray to the prejudice of his right. Memorials to the &s;ame effect had been pre&s;ented by the king of Sardinia, the dukes of Tu&s;cany, Parma, and Modena. France and Spain were inclined to &s;upport them again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Europe &s;eemed to be on the eve of a new war. King George was intangled in &s;uch a variety of treaties and intere&s;ts, that he knew not well how to extricate him&s;elf from the trouble&s;ome engage|ments he had contracted. By declaring for the emperor he mu&s;t have counte|nanced the new e&s;tabli&s;hment at O&s;tend, which was &s;o prejudicial to his Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and incurred the re&s;entment of France, Spain, and their allies of Italy. In renouncing the intere&s;t of the emperor, he would have expo&s;ed his German dominions. In vain he exhorted the emperor to relax in his di&s;putes with Spain, and give up the O&s;tend company, which was &s;o detrimental and di&s;agreeable to his faithful allies$ the court of Vienna promi&s;ed in general to ob&s;erve the treaties which it had concluded; but, declined entering into any particular di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion; &s;o that all his maje&s;ty's endeavours i&s;&s;ued in contracting clo&s;er connex|ions with Pru&s;&s;ia and Denmark. All tho&s;e negotiations carried on, all tho&s;e treaties concluded by king George, with almo&s;t every prince and &s;tate in Chri|&s;tendom, which &s;ucceeded one another &s;o fa&s;t, and appear, at fir&s;t view, &s;o in|tricate and unaccountable, were founded upon two &s;imple and natural princi|ples, namely, the de&s;ire of a&s;certaining his acqui&s;itions as elector of Hanover; and his re&s;olution to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t the di&s;affection of his Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects, and the efforts of the pretender.</P>

<P>Great Britain, at this period, enjoyed profound tranquillity. Ireland was a little ruffled by an incident which &s;eems to have been mi&s;repre&s;ented to the people of that kingdom. William Wood had obtained a patent for fur|ni&s;hing Ireland with copper currency, in which it was deficient. A great cla|mour was rai&s;ed again&s;t this coin. The parliament of that kingdom, which met in September, re&s;olved, That it would be prejudicial to the revenue, de|&s;tructive of trade, and of dangerous con&s;equence to the rights of the &s;ub|ject: That the patent had been obtained by mi&s;repre&s;entation: That the half|pence wanted weight: That even, if the terms of the patent had been complied with, there would have been a great lo&s;s to the nation: That granting the power of coinage to a private per&s;on had ever been highly prejudicial to the kingdom; and would at all times be of dangerous con&s;equence. Addre&s;&s;es from both hou&s;es were pre&s;ented to the king on this &s;ubject. The affair was referred to the lords of the privy-council of England. They ju&s;tified the con|duct of the patentee, upon the report of Sir I&s;aac Newton and other officers of the mint, who had made the a&s;&s;ay and trial of Wood's halfpence; and found he had complied with the terms of the patent. They declared, that this currency exceeded in goodne&s;s, finene&s;s, and value of metal, all the copper mo|ney which had been coined for Ireland, in the reigns of king Charles II. king James II. king William and queen Mary. The privy council likewi&s;e de|mon&s;trated, that his maje&s;ty's predece&s;&s;ors had always exerci&s;ed the undoubted
<PB N="503" REF="5060">
prerogative of granting patents for copper coinage in Ireland to private per&s;ons: that none of the&s;e patents had been &s;o beneficial to the kingdom as this granted to William Wood, who had not obtained it in an unprecedented manner; but after a reference to the attorney and &s;ollicitor-general, and after Sir I&s;aac New|ton had been con&s;ulted in every particular: finally, they proved, by a great number of witne&s;&s;es, that there was a real want of &s;uch money in Ireland. Notwith&s;tanding this deci&s;ion, the ferment of the Iri&s;h nation was indu&s;triou&s;ly kept up by clamour, pamphlets, papers, and lampoons, written by dean Swift, and other authors; &s;o that Wood voluntarily reduced his coinage from the value of one hundred thou&s;and to that of forty thou&s;and pounds. Thus the noi&s;e was &s;ilenced. The commons of Ireland pa&s;&s;ed an act for accepting the affirmation of the quakers in&s;tead of an oath; and voted three hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds towards di&s;charging the debt of the nation, which amounted to about double that &s;um.</P>

<P>In the month of October England lo&s;t a worthy nobleman in the death of earl Cowper, who had twice di&s;charged the office of lord chancellor, with equal di&s;cernment and integrity. He was profoundly &s;killed in the laws of his country; in his apprehen&s;ion quick and penetrating; in his judg+ment clear and determinate. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a manly eloquence: his manner was agreeable, and deportment graceful. This year was likewi&s;e remarkable for the death of the duke of Orleans regent of France; who, &s;ince the decea&s;e of Lewis XIV. had ruled that nation with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute authority. He was a prince of ta&s;te and &s;pirit, endowed with &s;hining talents for empire, which he did not fail to di&s;play, even in the mid&s;t of effeminate pur&s;uits and idle de|bauchery. From the infirm con&s;titution of the infant king, he had conceived hopes of a&s;cending the throne, and taken his mea&s;ures accordingly; but the young monarch's health began to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and all the duke's &s;chemes were defeated by an apoplexy, of which he died in the fiftieth year of his age, after having nominated the duke of Bourbon as prime mini&s;ter. King George immediately received a&s;&s;urances of the good di&s;po&s;ition of the French court, to cultivate and even improve the good under&s;tanding &s;o happily e&s;tabli&s;hed be|tween France and Great-Britain. The king arrived in England on the eighteenth day of December; and on the ninth of January the parliament was a&s;&s;embled. His maje&s;ty, in his &s;peech, recommended to the commons the care of the public debts; and he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing the &s;inking fund improved and augmented, &s;o as to put the debt of the nation into a method of being &s;peedily and gradually di&s;charged.</P>

<P>This was the repeated theory of patrioti&s;m, which unhappily for the &s;ubjects was never reduced to practice: not, but that a beginning of &s;uch a laudable work was made in this very &s;e&s;&s;ion, by an act for le&s;&s;ening the public debts, by which it was provided, that the annuities at five per cent. charged on the general fund by a former act, except &s;uch as had been &s;ub&s;cribed into the South-&s;ea, together with the un&s;ub&s;cribed blanks of the lottery, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fourteen, &s;hould be payed off at Lady-day of the year next en&s;uing, with the money ari&s;ing from the &s;inking fund. The mini&s;try, however, did not per&s;evere in this path of prudent oeconomy. The commons granted all the &s;upplies that were demanded. They voted ten thou|&s;and &s;eamen; and the majority, though not without violent oppo&s;ition, agreed
<PB N="504" REF="5070">
to maintain four thou&s;and additional troops which had been rai&s;ed in the preceding year; &s;o that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the land-forces amounted to eighteen thou&s;and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldm$$on P$lit. State. Hi$t. Regi&s;t. Annals of K. George. Mem. Hi&s;t. Tindal</NOTE> two hundred and &s;ixty-four. The expence of the year was defrayed by a land-tax and malt-tax. The commons having di&s;patched the &s;upply, took into con&s;idera|tion a grievance ari&s;ing from protections granted by foreign mini&s;ters, peers, and members of parliament, under which profligate per&s;ons u&s;ed to &s;creen them|&s;elves from the pro&s;ecution of their ju&s;t creditors. The commons re&s;olved, That all protections granted by members of that hou&s;e &s;hould be declared void, and immediately withdrawn. The lords made a declaration to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, with an exception of menial &s;ervants, and tho&s;e nece&s;&s;arily employed about the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch. 1$24.</NOTE> e&s;tates of peers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The duke of Newca&s;tle was now appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate; the duke of Gra&s;ton lord-cham|berlain; and lord Carteret lord-lieutenant of Ireland.</P>

This nobleman had connived at certain venal practices touching the &s;ale of places, and the money of &s;uitors depo&s;ited with the ma&s;ters of chancery, &s;o as to incur the general reproach of the nation.

<P>The&s;e papers being taken into con&s;ideration, Sir George Oxenden ob&s;erved, that enormous abu&s;es had crept into the high court of chancery: that the crimes and mi&s;demeanors of the late lord-chancellor were many and various, but might be reduced to the following heads: that he had embezzled the e&s;tates and effects of many widows, orphans, and lunatics: that he had rai&s;ed the offices of ma&s;ters in chancery to an exorbitant price; tru&s;ting in their hands large &s;ums of money belonging to &s;uitors, that they might be en|abled to comply with his exorbitant demands: and, that in &s;everal ca&s;es he had made divers irregular orders. He therefore moved, That Thomas earl of Macclesfield &s;hould be impeached of high crimes and mi&s;demeanor$. Mr. Pulteney moved, That this affair might be left to the con&s;ideration of a &s;elect committee. Sir William Wyndham a&s;&s;erted, that in proceeding by way<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. Mem. Hi&s;t.

The que&s;tion being put, it was carried for the impeach|ment. The earl was accordingly impeached at the bar of the upper hou&s;e: a committee was apppointed to prepare articles; and a bill was brought in to indemnify the ma&s;ters in chancery from the penalties of the law, upon di&s;cover|ing what con&s;iderations they had payed for their admi&s;&s;ion to their re&s;pective<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The trial la&s;ted twenty days; the earl was convicted of fraudulent practices, and condemned in a fine of thirty thou&s;and pounds, with impri|&s;onment until that &s;um &s;hould be payed. He was immediately committed to the Tower, where he continued about &s;ix weeks; but, upon producing the money he was di&s;charged; and Sir Peter King, created baron of Oakham, &s;ucceeded him in the office of chancellor.</P>

<P>His maje&s;ty, on the eighth day of April, gave the hou&s;e of com|mons to under&s;tand, that having been engaged in &s;ome extraordinary expences, he hoped he &s;hould be enabled to rai&s;e a &s;um of money, by making u&s;e of the funds lately e&s;tabli&s;hed for the payment of the civil-li&s;t annuities, in order to di&s;charge the debts contracted in his civil government. Mr. Pulteney, cofferer of the hou&s;hold, moved for an addre&s;s, That an account &s;hould be layed before the hou&s;e of all monies payed for &s;ecret-&s;ervice, pen&s;ions, and bounties, from the twenty-fifth day of March in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and one, to the twenty-fifth of the &s;ame month in the pre&s;ent year. This addre&s;s being voted, a motion was made to con&s;ider the king's me&s;&s;age. Mr. Pulteney ur|ged, that this con&s;ideration &s;hould be po&s;tponed until the hou&s;e &s;hould have examined the papers that were the &s;ubject of the addre&s;s. He expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize, that a debt amounting to above five hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be contracted in three years: he &s;aid, he did not wonder that &s;ome per&s;ons &s;hould be &s;o eager to make good the deficiencies of the civil-li&s;t, &s;ince they

and their friends enjoyed &s;uch a &s;hare of that revenue; and, he de&s;ired to know, Whether this was all that was due, or, whether they &s;hould expect another reckoning? This gentleman began to be di&s;&s;atisfied with the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try; and his &s;arca&s;ms were aimed at Mr. Walpole, who undertook to an|&s;wer his objections. The commons took the me&s;&s;age into con&s;ideration, and pa&s;&s;ed a bill, enabling his maje&s;ty to rai&s;e any &s;um not exceeding one mil|lion, by exchequer-bills, loans, or otherwi&s;e, on the credit of the deductions of &s;ixpence per pound, directed by an act of parliament of the &s;eventh year of his maje&s;ty, and of the civil-li&s;t revenues, at an intere&s;t not exceeding three pounds per cent. till repayment of the principal.</P>

<P>On the twentieth day of April a petition was pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e by the lord Finch, in behalf of Henry St. John, late vi&s;count Boling|broke, praying, that the execution of the law with re&s;pect to his forfeitures might be &s;u&s;pended, as a pardon had &s;u&s;pended it with re&s;pect to his life. Mr. Walpole &s;ignified to the hou&s;e, by his maje&s;ty's command, that &s;even years before the petitioner had made his humble application and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the king, with a&s;&s;urances of duty, allegiance, and fidelity: that from his behaviour &s;ince that time, his maje&s;ty was convinced of his being a fit object of his mercy; and con&s;ented to his petitioning the hou&s;e. The petition being read, Mr. Wal|pole declared him&s;elf fully &s;atisfied, that the petitioner had &s;ufficiently atoned for his pa&s;t offences; and therefore de&s;erved the favour of that hou&s;e, &s;o far as to enable him to enjoy the family-inheritance that was &s;ettled upon him, which he could not do by virtue of his maje&s;ty's pardon, without an act of parlia|ment. Lord Finch moved, That a bill might be brought in for this purpo&s;e; and was warmly oppo&s;ed by Mr. Methuen, comptroller of the hou&s;hold, who repre&s;ented Bolingbroke as a mon&s;ter of iniquity. His remon&s;trance was &s;upported by lord William Powlet and Mr. On&s;low; neverthele&s;s, the bill was prepared, pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent. An act being pa&s;&s;ed for di&s;arming the Highlanders of Scotland: another for regulating elections within the city of London: a third for reducing the intere&s;t of &s;everal bank annuities, together with &s;ome bills of a private nature; the parliament was prorogued in May, after the king had, in the warme&s;t terms of acknow|ledgment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>On the fifth day of December the prince&s;s of Wales was delivered of a prince&s;s, chri&s;tened by the name of Loui&s;a, and afterwards married to the king of Denmark.

<P>The tide of political intere&s;ts on the continent had begun to flow in a new channel, &s;o as to render ineffectual the mounds which he had rai&s;ed by his multiplicity of negotiations. Lewis, the Spani&s;h monarch, dying &s;oon after his elevation to the throne, his father Philip re&s;umed the crown which he had de&s;igned; and gave him&s;elf up implicitly to the conduct of his queen, who was a prince&s;s of indefatigable intrigue and in&s;atiate ambition. The infanta, who had been married to Lewis XV. of France, was &s;o di&s;agreeable to her
<PB N="507" REF="5100">
hu&s;band, that the whole French nation began to be apprehen&s;ive of a civil war, in con&s;equence of his dying without male i&s;&s;ue: he therefore determined, with the advice of his council, to &s;end back the infanta, as the nuptials had not been con&s;ummated; and &s;he was attended to Madrid by the marquis de Monteleone. The queen of Spain re&s;ented this in&s;ult offered to her daughter; and, in revenge, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed mademoi&s;elle de Beaujolois, one of the regent's daughters, who had been betrothed to her &s;on Don Carlos. As the congre&s;s at Cambray had proved ineffectual, &s;he offered to adju&s;t her differences with the emperor under the &s;ole mediation of Great-Britain. This was an honour which king George declined. He was aver&s;e to any undertaking that might interrupt the harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and the court of Ver&s;ailles; and he had taken umbrage at the emperor's refu&s;ing to grant the inve&s;titure of Bremen and Verden, except upon terms which he did not choo&s;e to embrace. The peace between the courts of Vienna and Madrid, which he refu&s;ed to mediate, was effected by a private negotiation, under the management of the duke de Rip|perda, a native of the &s;tates-general, who had renounced the prote&s;tant religion, and entered into the &s;ervice of his catholic maje&s;ty. By two treaties, &s;igned at Vienna in the month of April, the emperor acknowledged Philip as king of Spain and the Indies, promi&s;ing, that he would not mole&s;t him in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of tho&s;e dominions that were &s;ecured to him by the treaty of Utrecht. Philip renounced all preten&s;ions to the dominions in Italy and the Netherlands, adjudged to the emperor by the treaty of London: Charles granted the inve&s;ti|ture of the dukedoms of Tu&s;cany, Parma, and Placentia, to the elde&s;t &s;on of the queen of Spain, in default of heirs in the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, as ma&s;culine fiefs of the empire. Spain became guaranty of the Au&s;trian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, according to the pragmatic &s;anction, by which the dominions of that hou&s;e were &s;ettled on the emperor's heirs general, and declare to be a perpetual, indivi&s;ible, and in&s;eparable feoffment to the primogeniture. By the commercial treaty of Vienna, the Au&s;trian &s;ubjects were intitled to advantages in trade with Spain, which no other nation enjoyed. His catholic maje&s;ty guarantied the O&s;tend Ea&s;t-India company; and agreed to pay an annual &s;ub&s;idy of four millions of pia&s;ters to the emperor. Great &s;ums were remitted to Vienna: the Imperial forces were augmented to a formidable number; and other powers were &s;ollicited to engage in this alliance, to which the court of Peter&s;burgh actually acceded.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXV.</HEAD>
<P>The king of Great-Britain took the alarm. The emperor and he had for &s;ome time treated each other with manife&s;t coldne&s;s. He had rea&s;on to fear &s;ome attempt upon his German dominions; and projected a defen&s;ive treaty with France and Pru&s;&s;ia. This alliance, limited to the term of fifteen years, was negotiated and concluded at Hanover, in the month of September. It im|plied a mutual guaranty of the dominions po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the contracting parties, their rights and privileges, tho&s;e of commerce in particular, and an engage|ment to procure &s;atisfaction to the prote&s;tants of Thorn, who had lately been oppre&s;&s;ed by the catholics, contrary to the treaty of Oliva. The king having taken the&s;e precautions at Hanover, &s;et out on his return for England, embarked at Helvoet&s;luys in the middle of December; and after having been expo&s;ed to the fury of a dreadful &s;torm, was landed with great difficulty at Rye, from whence he proceeded by land to London. The parliament meeting on the twentieth day of the next month, he gave them to under&s;tand, that the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="508" REF="5110">
condition of &s;ome of their prote&s;tant brethren abroad, and the negotiations and engagements contracted by &s;ome foreign powers, which &s;eemed to have layed the foundation of new troubles and di&s;turbances in Europe, and to threaten his &s;ubjects with the lo&s;s of &s;everal of the mo&s;t advantageous branches of their trade, had obliged him to concert with other powers, &s;uch mea&s;ures as might give a check to the ambitious views of tho&s;e who were endeavouring to render them|&s;elves formidable; and put a &s;top to the further progre&s;s of &s;uch dangerous de|&s;igns. He told them, that the enemies of his government were already very bu&s;y, by their in&s;truments and emi&s;&s;aries in tho&s;e courts, who&s;e mea&s;ures &s;eemed mo&s;t to favour their purpo&s;es, in &s;olliciting and promoting the cau&s;e of the pretender. One &s;ees, at fir&s;t &s;ight, that the intere&s;ts of Germany dictated the treaty of Hanover; but, in order to &s;ecure the approbation of Great-Britain, upon which the &s;upport of this alliance chiefly depended, it was judged nece&s;|&s;ary to in&s;ert the articles relating to commerce and the prote&s;tant religion, as if the engagement had been contracted purely for the advantage and glory of Eng|land. In a word, the mini&s;try began now to ring the changes upon a few words that have been repeated ever &s;ince, like cabali&s;tical &s;ounds, by which the nation has been enchanted into a very dangerous connexion with the concerns of the continent. They harangued, they in&s;i&s;ted upon the machinations of the di&s;af|fected, the de&s;igns of a popi&s;h pretender, the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, and the ballance of power, until the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions became ab&s;olutely terms of ridicule, with every per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e and reflection. The people were told, that the em|peror and king of Spain, exclu&s;ive of the public treaties concluded at Vienna, had entered into private engagements, importing, that the Imperiali&s;ts &s;hould join the Spaniards in recovering Gibraltar and Portmahon by force of arms, in ca&s;e the king of England &s;hould refu&s;e to re&s;tore them amicably, according to a &s;olemn promi&s;e he had made: that a double marriage &s;hould take place between the two infants of Spain, and the two archdutche&s;&s;es of Au&s;tria: and, that means &s;hould be taken to place the pretender on the throne of Great-Britain.</P>

<P>When the treaties of Vienna and Hanover fell under con&s;ideration of the hou&s;e of commons, Horatio Walpole, afterwards termed <Q>&startq;the ballance-ma&s;ter,&endq;</Q> inderi&s;ion, opened the debate with a long unanimated oration, giving a detail of the affairs of Europe &s;ince the treaty of Utrecht. He enumerated the barrier-treaty, the convention for executing that treaty, the defen&s;ive alliance with the emperor, the other with the mo&s;t chri&s;tian king and the &s;tates-general, another convention, the quadruple alliance, the congre&s;s at Cambray, the treaty of Hanover, and that of Vienna. He explained the nature of each engagement. He &s;aid, the main de&s;ign of the treaty of commerce concluded between the em|peror and Spain, was to countenance and &s;upport the Ea&s;t-India company e&s;ta|bli&s;hed at Oftend, which interfered &s;o e&s;&s;entially with the Ea&s;t-India companies of England and Holland, and was directly contrary to &s;everal &s;olemn treaties &s;till in force. He enlarged upon the danger to which the ballance of power would be expo&s;ed, &s;hould the i&s;&s;ue-male of this projected marriage between the hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Spain, ever po&s;&s;e&s;s the Imperial dignity and the kingdom of Spain together. The reader will take notice, that this very man was one of tho&s;e who exclaimed again&s;t that article of the treaty at Utrecht, which pre|vented the power of tho&s;e two hou&s;es from being immediately united in the per&s;on of the emperor. He did not forget to expatiate upon the pretended &s;ecret
<PB N="509" REF="5120" MS="Y">
engagement concerning Gibraltar and Minorca; and the king's pious concern for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed prote&s;tants of Thorn in Poland. In vain did Mr. Shippen urge, that the treaty of Hanover would engage the Briti&s;h nation in a war for the def nce of the king's German dominions, contrary to an expre&s;s provi&s;ion made in the act of limitation. The&s;e arguments had lo&s;t all weight. The op|po&s;ition was &s;o incon&s;iderable, that the mini&s;try had no rea&s;on to be in pain about any mea&s;ure they &s;hould propo&s;e. An addre&s;s was voted and delivered to his maje&s;ty, approving the alliance he had concluded at Hanover, in order to obvi|ate and di&s;appoint the dangerous views and con&s;equences of the treaty of peace betwixt the emperor and the king of Spain; and promi&s;ing to &s;upport his ma|je&s;ty again&s;t all in&s;ults and attacks that &s;hould be made upon any of his terri|tories, though not belonging to the crown of Great-Britain. An addre&s;s of the &s;ame kind was pre&s;ented by the hou&s;e of lords in a body. A bill was brought in, impowering the commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury to compound with Mr. Rich|ard Hampden late trea&s;urer of the navy, for a debt he owed to the crown, amounting to eight and forty thou&s;and pounds. This deficiency was occa&s;ioned by his embarking in the South-&s;ea &s;cheme. The king recommended his pe|tition; and the hou&s;e complied with his reque&s;t, in con&s;ideration of his great-grandfather the famous John Hampden, who made &s;uch a noble &s;tand again&s;t the arbitrary mea&s;ures of the fir&s;t Charles.</P>

<P>The malt-tax was found &s;o grievous to Scotland, that the peo|ple refu&s;ed to pay it, and riots were excited in different parts of the kingdom. At Gla&s;gow, the populace, armed with clubs and &s;taves, rifled the hou&s;e of Daniel Campbell their repre&s;entative in parliament, who had voted for the bill; and maltreated &s;ome exci&s;emen who attempted to take an account of the malt. General Wade, who commanded the forces in Scotland, had &s;ent two compa|nies of &s;oldiers under the command of captain Bu&s;hel, to prevent or appea&s;e any di&s;turbance of this nature. He drew up his men in the &s;treet, where they were pelted with &s;tones by the multitude, which he endeavoured to di&s;per&s;e by firing among them without &s;hot. This expedient failing, he ordered his men to load their pieces with ball, and at a time when the magi&s;trates were advancing towards him in a body, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with their advice and influence, he com|manded the &s;oldiers to fire four different ways, without the &s;anction of the civil authority. Above twenty per&s;ons were killed or wounded on this occa&s;ion. The people &s;eeing &s;o many victims fall, were exa&s;perated beyond all &s;en&s;e of danger. They began to procure arms, and breathed nothing but defiance and revenge. Bu&s;hel thought proper to retreat to the ca&s;tle of Dumbarton; and was pur&s;ued above five miles by the enraged multitude. General Wade being informed of this tran&s;action, a&s;&s;embled a body of forces; and being accompa|nied by Duncan Forbes lord advocate, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gla&s;gow. The ma|gi&s;trates<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon. Annals. Deb. in Parl. Mem. Hi&s;t. Tindal.</NOTE> were apprehended and conveyed pri&s;oners to Edinburgh, where the lords-ju&s;ticiary having taken cognizance of the affair, declared them innocent; &s;o that they were immediately di&s;charged. Bu&s;hel was tried for murder, con|victed and condemned; but, in&s;tead of undergoing the penalties of the law, he was indulged with a pardon, and promoted in the &s;ervice. Daniel Campbell having petitioned the hou&s;e of commons, that he might be indemnified for the damage he had &s;u&s;tained from the rioters, a bill pa&s;&s;ed in his favour, grant|ing him a certain &s;um to be rai&s;ed from an impo&s;ition layed upon all the beer and

ale brewed within the city of Gla&s;gow. The malt-tax was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt in Scotland, that the convention of the royal burroughs pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance again&s;t it, as a grievous burthen which their country could not bear: petitions to the &s;ame purport were delivered to the commons from different &s;hires of that<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He was &s;ent by the chevalier de St. George with creden|tials to the court of Madrid, where he abjured the prote&s;tant religion, married a lady of the queen of Spain's bedchamber, and obtained the rank and appointments of a lieutenant-colonel in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice.</NOTE>.

A debate en&s;ued; but the ma|jority complied with the demand. Some members in the upper hou&s;e com|plained, that the me&s;&s;age was not &s;ent to both hou&s;es of parliament; and this &s;ugge&s;tion gave ri&s;e to another debate, in which lord Bathur&s;t and others made &s;ome melancholy reflections upon the &s;tate of in&s;ignificance to which the peers of England were reduced. Such remarks, however, were very little minded by the mini&s;try, which had obtained a complete victory over all oppo&s;ition. The &s;up|plies ordinary and extraordinary being granted, with every thing el&s;e which the court thought proper to a&s;k; and &s;everal bills pa&s;&s;ed for the regulation of civil oeconomy, the king di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the parliament on the twenty-fourth day of May.</P>

<P>By this time Peter the czar of Mu&s;covy was dead, and his em|pre&s;s Catherine had &s;ucceeded him on the Ru&s;&s;ian throne. This prince&s;s had begun to a&s;&s;emble forces in the neighbourhood of Peter&s;burgh; and prepare a formidable armament for a naval expedition. King George concluding, that her de&s;ign was again&s;t Sweden, &s;ent a &s;trong &s;quadron into the Baltic, under the command of Sir Charles Wager, in order to anticipate her views upon his allies. The Engli&s;h fleet being joined at Copenhagen by a Dani&s;h &s;quadron, alarmed the court of Ru&s;&s;ia, which immediately i&s;&s;ued orders for reinforcing the garri|&s;ons of Wibourg, Cron&s;lot, Revel, and Riga. The Engli&s;h admiral having had an audence of his Swedi&s;h maje&s;ty, &s;teered towards Revel, and &s;ent thither a lieutenant with a letter from the king of Great-Britain to the czarina. This was an expo&s;tulation, in which he ob&s;erved, that he and his allies could not fail of being alarmed at her great preparations by &s;ea and land. He complained, that mea&s;ures had been taken at her court in favour of the pretender: that his repeated in&s;tances for e&s;tabli&s;hing a la&s;ting friend&s;hip with the crown of Ru&s;&s;ia, had been treated with neglect; and he gave her to under&s;tand, that he had or|dered his admiral to prevent her &s;hips from coming out of her harbours, &s;hould &s;he per&s;i$t in her re&s;olution to execute the de&s;igns &s;he had projected. The cza|rina, in her an&s;wer to the king, expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urprize, that &s;he had not received his maje&s;ty's letter until his fleet was at anchor before Revel, &s;ince it would have been more agreeable to the cu&s;tom e&s;tabli&s;hed among &s;overeigns, and to the amity which had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between her kingdoms and the crown of Great-Britain, to expo&s;tulate with her on her armament, and expect her an&s;wer

before he had proceeded to &s;uch an offen&s;ive mea&s;ure. She a&s;&s;ured him, that nothing was farther from her thoughts than any de&s;igns to di&s;turb the peace of the North; and with regard to the pretender, it was a frivolous and &s;tale accu|&s;ation, which had been frequently u&s;ed as a pretext to cover all the unkind &s;teps lately taken again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. Sir Charles Wager continued in his &s;tation until he received certain intelligence, that the Ru&s;&s;ian gallies were layed up in their winter harbour: then he &s;et &s;ail for the coa&s;t of Denmark, from whence he returned to England in the month of November.</P>

<P>King George, that he might not &s;eem to convert all his attention to the affairs of the North, had equipped two other $quadrons; one of which was de&s;tined for the We&s;t-Indies, under the command of admiral Ho&s;ier. The other, conducted by Sir John Jennings, having on board a body of land-forces, &s;ailed from St. Helen's on the twentieth day of July, entered the bay of St. Antonio; then vi&s;ited Li&s;bon, from whence he directed his cour&s;e to the bay of Bulls near Cadiz, and crui&s;ed off Cape St. Mary's, &s;o as to alarm the coa&s;t of Spain, and fill Madrid with con&s;ternation. Yet he committed no act of ho&s;tility; but was treated with great civility by the Spani&s;h governor of Cadiz, who &s;upplied him with refre&s;hments. Rear-admiral Ho&s;ier, with &s;even &s;hips of war, had &s;a$$ed in April for the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies, with in&s;tructions to block up the galleons in the ports of that country; or, &s;hould they pre&s;ume to come out, &s;eize and bring them to England. Before his arrival at the Ba&s;ti|mentos near Porto Bello, the trea&s;ure, con&s;i&s;ting of above &s;ix millions &s;terling, had been unloaded and carried back to Panama, in pur&s;uance of an order &s;ent by an advice-boat, which had the &s;tart of Ho&s;ier. This admiral lay inactive on that &s;tatio$ until he became the je&s;t of the Spaniards. He returned to Ja|maica, where he found means to reinforce his crews: then he &s;tood over to Carthagene. The Spaniards had by this time &s;eized the Engli&s;h South-&s;ea &s;hip at La Vera-Cruz, together with all the ve&s;&s;els and effects belonging to that company. Ho&s;ier in vain demanded re&s;titution: he took &s;ome Spani&s;h &s;hips by way of repri&s;al, and continued cruizing in tho&s;e &s;eas until the greater part of his men peri&s;hed deplorably by the di&s;ea&s;es of that unhealthy climate; and his &s;hips were totally ruined by the worms. This brave officer being re&s;tricted by his orders from obeying the dictates of his courage; &s;eeing his be&s;t offcers and men daily &s;wept off by an outrageous di&s;temper, and his &s;hips expo&s;ed to inevitable de&s;truction, is &s;aid to have died of a broken heart; while the people of England loudly clamoured again&s;t this unfortunate expedition, in which &s;o many lives were thrown away, and &s;o much money expended without the lea&s;t advantage to the nation. It &s;eems to have been a mean p$$atical &s;cheme to rob the court of Spain of its expected trea&s;ure, even while a peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two nations. The mini&s;try of Great-Britain indeed alledged, that the Spani&s;h king had entered into engagements in favour of the pretender.</P>

<P>The dukes of Ormond and Wharton, and the earl Mari&s;chal, were certainly at Madrid; and the duke de Ripperda, now prime mini&s;ter of Spain, dropped &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions to the Engli&s;h envoy, that implied &s;ome &s;uch de&s;ign, which, however, the court of Madrid po&s;itively denied. Ripperda, as a fo|reigner, fell a &s;acrifice to the jealou&s;y of the Spani&s;h mini&s;ters.

amba&s;&s;ador, who was unwilling to be troubled with &s;uch a gue&s;t.

He afterwards made his e&s;cape, and &s;heltered him&s;elf in England, from the re|&s;entment of his catholic maje&s;ty. Colonel Stanhope complained of this viola|tion of the law of nations, which the Spani&s;h mini&s;ters endeavoured to excu&s;e. Memorials and letters pa&s;&s;ed between the two courts, and every thing tended to a rupture. The king of Spain purcha&s;ed &s;hips of war; began to make preparations for &s;ome important undertaking; and a&s;&s;embled an army of twenty thou&s;and men at St. Roch, on pretence of rebuilding the old ca&s;tle of Gib|raltar. Mean while the &s;tates-general and the king of Sweden acceded to the treaty of Hanover: but the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, though his maje&s;ty's &s;on-in-law, was detached from the alliance by the emperor, with whom he contracted new engagements.</P>

<P>On the &s;eventeenth day of January, the Briti&s;h parliament was opened with a long elaborate &s;peech, importing, That the proceedings and tran&s;actions of the emperor and king of Spain, and the &s;ecret offen&s;ive alliances concluded between them, had layed the foundations of a mo&s;t exorbitant and formidable power: that they were directly levelled again&s;t the mo&s;t valuable and darling intere&s;ts and privileges of the Engli&s;h nation, which mu&s;t either give up Gibraltar to Spain, and acquie&s;ce in the emperor's u&s;urped exerci&s;e of commerce, or re&s;olve vigorou&s;ly to defend their undoubted rights again&s;t tho&s;e reciprocal engagements contracted in defiance and violation of all national faith, and the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties. He a&s;&s;ured them, that one of tho&s;e &s;ecret ar|ticles was, the placing the pretender on the throne of Great-Britain; and an|other, the conque&s;t of Gibraltar and Portmahon. He affirmed, that tho&s;e combinations extended them&s;elves into Ru&s;&s;ia; and that the Engli&s;h fleet &s;ea|&s;onably prevented &s;uch de&s;igns as would have opened a way to the inva&s;ion of the&s;e kingdoms. He exhorted the commons to grant &s;uch &s;upplies as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of their country, and for making good his en|gagements with the allies of Great-Britain. He told them, that the king of Spain had ordered his mini&s;ter re&s;iding in England to quit the kingdom; and that he had left a memorial, little &s;hort of a declaration, in which he in&s;i&s;ted upon the re&s;titution of Gibraltar. He did not fail to touch the energic &s;trings which always moved their pa&s;&s;ions; the balance of power in Europe, the &s;e|curity of the Briti&s;h commerce, the de&s;igns of a popi&s;h pretender, the pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment, the religion, liberties, and properties of a prote&s;tant people. Such addre&s;&s;es of t$anks were penned in both hou&s;es as the mini&s;ters were plea&s;ed to dictate; yet not without oppo&s;ition from a minority, which was far from being formidable, though headed by chiefs of uncommon talents and re&s;olution. The com$ons voted twenty thou&s;and &s;eamen, and &s;ix and twenty thou&s;and three hundred eighty-three men for the land-&s;ervice; and to defray the extraordinary expence, a laid-tax of four &s;hillings in the pound was granted.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e of lords having taken into con&s;ideration the letters and memorials between the mini&s;ters of Great-Britain, France, and Spain, and the papers relating to the acce&s;&s;ion of the &s;tates-general to the treaty of Hanover; a warm debate en&s;ued. The lord Bathur&s;t took notice, that the
<PB N="513" REF="5160">
acce&s;&s;ion of the &s;tates-general to the treaty, was upon condition, that this their act &s;hould be approved and ratified by the king of Great-Britain, the mo&s;t chri&s;tian king, and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; but that the mini&s;ter of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty had refu&s;ed to &s;ign the act of acce&s;&s;ion, which was therefore of no effect: that if the court of France &s;hould, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, think it&s;elf di&s;engaged from the Hanover alliance, Britain alone would be obliged to bear the burthen of an expen&s;ive war again&s;t two of the greate&s;t potentates of Eu|rope. He &s;aid he could not &s;ee any ju&s;t rea&s;on for a rupture with Spain: that indeed the duke de Ripperda might have dropped &s;ome indi&s;creet expre&s;&s;ions: he was known to be a man of a violent temper; and he had been &s;olemnly di&s;|avowed by his catholic maje&s;ty: that, in the memorial left by the Spani&s;h am|ba&s;&s;ador, he imputed the violent &s;tate of affairs between the two crowns to the mini&s;ters of England; and mentioned a po&s;itive promi&s;e made by the king of Great-Britain for the re&s;titution of Gibraltar: that methods of ac|commodation might be tried before the kingdom engaged in a war which mu&s;t be attended with dangerous con&s;equences: that the nation was loaded with a debt of fifty millions; and, in order to maintain &s;uch a war, would be obliged to rai&s;e &s;even millions yearly; an annual &s;um by which the people would &s;oon be exhau&s;ted. He ob&s;erved, that in &s;ome papers layed before the hou&s;e, mention was made of great &s;ums di&s;tributed in divers places, to bring certain mea&s;ures to bear. He declared, that for his own part, he had touched neither Spani&s;h nor Engli&s;h gold; he was neither a Spaniard nor a Frenchman, but a true Engli&s;hman, and &s;o long as he had the honour to &s;it in that hou&s;e, he would &s;peak and act for the good of his country. He therefore de&s;ired their lord&s;hips &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the matter before them, which was of the la&s;t con&s;equence and importance to the whole nation. He &s;aid, nothing could be gained by the war &s;hould it prove &s;ucce&s;sful; and every thing would be lo&s;t &s;hould it be unpro&s;perous. He was an&s;werd by lord Town&s;hend, who affirmed, that his maje&s;ty had received po&s;itive and certain information with re&s;pect to the &s;ecret article of alliance between the courts of Vienna and Madrid, in fa|vour of the pretender, though the &s;afety of the &s;tate did not permit him to lay the&s;e advices before the parliament. After much altercation, the majority re|&s;olved, that the mea&s;ures his maje&s;ty had thought fit to take, were honourable, ju&s;t, and nece&s;&s;ary, for preventing the execution of the dangerous engagements entered into in favour of the pretender; for pre&s;erving the dominions belonging to the crown of Great-Britain by &s;olemn treaties, and particularly tho&s;e of Gibraltar and the i&s;land of Minorca; and for maintaining to his people their mo&s;t valuable rights and privileges of commerce, and the peace and tran|quillity of Europe. Seventeen lords entered a prote&s;t again&s;t this re&s;olution. Di&s;putes of the &s;ame nature aro&s;e from the &s;ame &s;ubject in the lower hou&s;e. Lord Town&s;hend had affirmed in the hou&s;e of peers, that no promi&s;e of re|&s;toring Gibraltar had been made: Sir Robert Walpole owned &s;uch a promi&s;e in the hou&s;e of commons: a motion was made for an addre&s;s, de&s;iring the&s;e engagements might be layed before the hou&s;e: another member moved for a copy of the memorial pre&s;ented by Mr. Pointz to the king of Sweden, and for the &s;ecret offen&s;ive article between the courts of Vienna and Madrid: a third motion was made to addre&s;s the king for &s;uch memorials and repre&s;enta|tions from the courts of Sweden and Denmark, as induced him, in the cour&s;e

of the preceding year, to &s;end a &s;quadron to the Baltic. In the account of the money granted for the &s;ervice of the la&s;t year, there was an article of one hundred and twenty-five thou&s;and pounds charged in general terms, as i&s;&s;ued out for other engagements and expences, over and above &s;uch as were &s;peci|fied. Mr. Pulteney moved for an addre&s;s on this &s;ubject; but each of the&s;e motions was rejected on a divi&s;ion; and the majority concurred in an addre&s;s of thanks to his maje&s;ty, for the great wi&s;dom of his conduct. They expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t implicit confidence in his goodne&s;s and di&s;cretion: they promi&s;ed to &s;upport him in all &s;uch further mea&s;ures as he &s;hould find nece&s;&s;ary and ex|pedient for preventing a rupture; and for the honour and advantage of the&s;e kingdoms.</P>

<P>His maje&s;ty's &s;peech gave &s;uch umbrage to the court of Vienna, that Mr. Palms, the Imperial re&s;ident at London, was ordered to pre&s;ent a warm memorial to the king, and afterwards to publi&s;h it to the whole nation. In this bold remon&s;trance, the king was charged with having declared from the throne, as certain and undoubted facts, &s;everal things that were either wre&s;ted, mi&s;repre&s;ented, or void of all foundation. The memoraili&s;t affirmed, that the treaty of Vienna was built on the quadruple alliance: that the treaty of commerce was calculated to promote the mutual and lawful advantages of the &s;ubjects of both parties, agreeably to the law of nations; and in no re&s;pect prejudicial to the Briti&s;h nation. He declared, that there was no offen&s;ive al|liance concluded between the two crowns: that the &s;uppo&s;ed article relating to the pretender, was an ab&s;olute fal&s;hood: that the in&s;inuation with re&s;pect to the &s;iege of Gibraltar was equally untrue, his ma&s;ter having made no engage|ments with the king of Spain but &s;uch as were &s;pecified in the treaty com|municated to his Britannic maje&s;ty. He &s;aid, the ho&s;tilities notoriou&s;ly com|mitted in the We&s;t-Indies, and el&s;ewhere, again&s;t the king of Spain, in vio|lation of treaties, &s;eemed to ju&s;tify that prince's undertaking the &s;iege of Gib|raltar. Finally, he demanded, in the name of his Imperial maje&s;ty, &s;uitable reparation for the injury his honour had &s;u&s;tained from &s;uch calumnious im|putations. Both hou&s;es of parliament expre&s;&s;ed their indignation at the in&s;o|lence of this memorial, in an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty; and Mr. Palms was or|dered to depart the kingdom. Virulent declarations were pre&s;ented by the mi|ni&s;ters of the emperor and king of Great-Britain, to the diet of the empire at Rati&s;bon; and &s;uch per&s;onal reflections retorted between the&s;e two potentates, that all hope of reconciliation vani&s;hed.</P>

<P>King George, in order to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t the impending &s;torm, entered into more &s;trict engagements with the French king; and agreed to pay fifty thou&s;and pounds for three years to the king of Sweden, in con|&s;ideration of that prince's holding in readine&s;s a body of ten thou&s;and troops for the occa&s;ions of the alliance. He concluded a fre&s;h treaty with the king of Denmark, who promi&s;ed to furni&s;h a certain number of auxiliaries, on account of a large &s;ub&s;idy granted by the king of France. The proportions of troops to be &s;ent into the field, in ca&s;e of a rupture, were a&s;certained. His Britannic maje&s;ty engaged for four and twenty thou&s;and men, and a &s;trong &s;quadron to be &s;ent into the Baltic. He made a convention with the prince of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, who undertook to provide eight thou&s;and infantry and four thou&s;and horse, in con&s;ideration of &s;eventy-four thou&s;and pounds to be payed

In the day of his trouble, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who had e&s;pou&s;ed his daughter, de&s;erted his intere&s;t; and the &s;tates-general &s;tood aloof. For the &s;ecurity of his German dominions, he had re|cour&s;e to the king of France, who was a precarious ally; to the kings of Sweden and Denmark, and the principality of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el: but none of the&s;e powers would contribute their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, without being gratified with exorbi|tant &s;ub&s;idies, though the danger was common, and the efforts ought to have been equal. In&s;tead of allies, they profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves mercenaries. Great-Britain payed them for the defence of their own dominions: &s;he moreover un|dertook to maintain a powerful fleet for their &s;afety.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1727.</NOTE> For the &s;upport of tho&s;e expen&s;ive treaties, Mr. Scroope, &s;e|cretary of the trea&s;ury, moved in the hou&s;e of commons, that, in the malt|tax bill, they &s;hould in&s;ert a clau&s;e of appropriation, impowering the king to apply &s;uch &s;ums as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for defraying the expences and engage|ments which had been or &s;hould be made before the twenty-fifth day of Sep|tember, in concerting &s;uch mea&s;ures as he &s;hould think mo&s;t conducive to the &s;ecurity of trade, and re&s;toring the peace of Europe. To little purpo&s;e did the members in the oppo&s;ition urge, that this method of a&s;king and granting &s;upplies was unparliamentary: that &s;uch a clau&s;e would render ineffectual that appropriation of the public money, which the wi&s;dom of all parliaments had thought a nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecurity again&s;t mi&s;application, which was the more to be feared, as no provi&s;ion was made to call any per&s;on to account for the money that &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of by virtue of this clau&s;e: that great &s;ums had al|ready been granted: that &s;uch an unlimited power ought never to be given in a free government: that &s;uch confidence in the crown might, through the induence of evil mini&s;ters, be attended with the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences: that the con&s;titution could not be pre&s;erved, but by a &s;trict adherence to tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential parliamentary forms of granting &s;upplies upon e&s;timates, and of ap|propriating the&s;e &s;upplies to &s;ervices and occa&s;ions publicly avowed and judged nece&s;&s;ary: that &s;uch clau&s;es, if not &s;ea&s;onably checked, would become &s;o fre|quent, as in time to lodge in the crown and in the mini&s;ters an ab&s;olute and uncontroulable power of rai&s;ing money upon the people, which by the con|&s;titution is, and with &s;afety can only be, lodged in the whole legi&s;lature. The motion was carried, the clau&s;e added, and the bill pa&s;&s;ed through the other hou&s;e without amendment, though not without oppo&s;ition. Notwith&s;tanding this vote of credit, Sir William Yonge moved, that towards the &s;upply granted to the king, the &s;um of three hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be rai&s;ed by loans on exchequer-bills, to be charged on the &s;urplus of the duties on coal and culm, which was re&s;erved for the parliament's di&s;po&s;al. Though this motion was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl and Mr. Pulteney, as a dangerous deviation from &s;everal votes and acts of parliament, by which the exceedings of the public funds were appropriated to the di&s;charge of the na|tional debt, or to the increa&s;e of the &s;inking-fund, it was carried by the ma|jority.</P>

<P>On the fifteeenth day of May the parliament was prorogued, after the king had acknowledged their zeal, liberality, and di&s;patch; and given them to under&s;tand, that the &s;iege of Gibraltar was actually begun. The tr$$ches were open$$ $$fore this fortre&s;s on the eleventh day of February, by the Cond&eacute; de las Torres, at the head of twenty thou&s;and men. The place was w$$$ provi$$$ $or a defence; and the old earl of Portmore, who was governor, e$barked with a rein$$rcement from England, under convoy of a fleet com|manded by Sir Charles Wager. He arrived at Gibraltar in the beginning of April$ where he landed the troops, with a great quantity of ammunition, warlike stores, and four and twenty pieces of cannon. At the &s;ame time, five hundred men arrived from Min$rca; &s;o that the garri&s;on amounted to &s;ix thou|&s;$nd, who were plentifully &s;upplied with fre&s;h provi&s;ions from the coa&s;t of Barbary, and treated the eff$rts of the be&s;iegers with great contempt. The &s;tates general being apprehen&s;ive of an attempt upon their barri$r in the Netherlands, de&s;ired the king would hold in r$adine&s;s the ten thou&s;and auxi|liaries &s;tip$lated in the treaty.

<P>Mean while, the powers at variance, though extremely irri|tated again&s;t each other, were all equally aver&s;e to a war that might again em|broil all Europe. The king of France interpo&s;ed his med$ation, which was conducted by the duke of Richelieu, his amba&s;&s;ador at Vienna. Plans and counterplans of pacification were propo&s;ed between the two crowns and the allies. At length all parties agreed to twelve preliminarary articles, which were &s;igned in May at Paris, by the mini&s;ters of the Hanover alliance, and afterwards at Vienna, by the Imperial and Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;adors. $hey imported, that ho&s;tilities &s;hould immediately cea&s;e: that the charter of the O&s;tend company &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended for &s;even years; and that a congre&s;s &s;hould in four months be opened at Aix-la-Chapelie, for adju&s;ting all differences, and con&s;olidating the peace of Europe. T$$s congre&s;s was afterwards transferred to Soi&s;&s;ons, for the conveniency of the $ren$h mini&s;ter, who&s;e pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary at court. The &s;ie$e of Gi$raltar was ra$&s;ed, after it had la&s;ted four months, during which the Spaniards lo&s;t a great numb$r of men by &s;ickne&s;s, while the garri&s;on &s;u&s;tained very little damage.

The kingdom was bewildered in a labyrinth of treaties and conventions, by which it &s;tood engaged in pecuniary &s;ub&s;idies to many powers upon the continent, with whom its real intere&s;ts could never be connected. The wealth of the nation had been lavi&s;hed upon the&s;e foreign connexions; upon unnece&s;&s;ary wars and fruitle&s;s expeditions. Dangerous incroachment had been made upon the con&s;titution by the repeal of the act for triennial par|liaments; by frequent &s;u&s;pen&s;ions of the Habeas corpus act upon frivolous oc|ca&s;ions; by repealing clau&s;es in the act of &s;ettlement; by votes of credit; by habituating the people to a &s;tanding army; and above all, by e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;y&s;tem of corruption, which at all times would &s;ecure a majority in parliament. The nature of prerogative, by which the liberties of the nation had formerly
<PB N="519" REF="5220">
been &s;o often endangered, was now &s;o well under&s;tood, and &s;o &s;ecurely re&s;trained, that it could no longer be u&s;ed for the &s;ame oppre&s;&s;ive purpo&s;es: be&s;ides, an avowed exten&s;ion of the prerogative required more ability, courage, and re&s;o|lution, than the pre&s;ent mini&s;try could exert. They under&s;tood their own &s;trength, and had recour&s;e to a more &s;afe and effectual expedient. The vice, luxury, and pro&s;titution of the age, the almo&s;t total extinction of &s;entiment, ho|nour, and public &s;pirit, had prepared the minds of men for &s;lavery and corrup|tion. The means were in the hands of the mini&s;try: the public trea&s;ure was at their devotion: they multiplied places and pen&s;ions to increa&s;e the number of their dependents: they &s;quandered away the money of the nation without ta&s;te, di&s;cernment, decency, or remor&s;e: they enli&s;ted an army of the mo&s;t abandoned emi&s;&s;aries, whom they employed to vindicate the wor&s;t mea&s;ures, in the face of truth, common &s;en&s;e, and common hone&s;ty; and they did not fall to &s;tigmatize as Jacobites and enemies to the government, all tho&s;e who pre&s;umed to que&s;tion the merit of their admini&s;tration.</P>

<P>The &s;upreme direction of affairs was not yet engro&s;&s;ed by a &s;ingle mini&s;ter. Lord Town&s;hend had the reputation of conducting the external tran&s;actions relating to treaties and negotiations. He is &s;aid to have un|der&s;tood that province, though he did not always follow the dictates of his own under&s;tanding. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an exten&s;ive fund of knowledge; and was well acquainted with the functions of his office. The duke of N. his colleague, was not remarkable for any of the&s;e qualifications; he owed his promotion to his uncommon zeal for the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hano|ver, and to the &s;trength of his intere&s;t in parliament, rather than to his judgment, preci&s;ion, or any other intellectual merit. Lord C. who may be counted an auxiliary, though not immediately concerned in the admini&s;tration, had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the character of envoy at &s;everal courts in Eu|rope. He had attained an intimate knowledge of all the different intere&s;ts and connexions &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among the powers of the continent; and he infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the mini&s;ters in learning and capacity. He was, indeed, the only man of genius employed under this government. He &s;poke with ea&s;e and propriety; his conceptions were ju&s;t and lively; his inferences bold; his coun&s;els vigorous and warm. Yet he depriciated his talents by acting in a &s;ubordinate character to tho&s;e whom he de&s;pi&s;ed; and &s;eemed to look upon the pernicious mea&s;ures of a bad mini&s;try with &s;ilent contempt, rather than with avowed dete&s;tation. The interior government of Great-Britain was chiefly ma|naged by Sir Robert W. a man of extraordinary talents, who had from low begin|nings rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the head of the trea&s;ury. Having obtained a &s;eat in the lower hou&s;e, he declared him&s;elf one of the mo&s;t forward parti&s;ans of the Whig faction. He was endued with a &s;pecies of eloquence, which though neither ner|vous nor elegant, flowed with great facility, and was &s;o plau&s;ible on all &s;ubjects, that even when he mi&s;repre&s;ented the truth, whether from ignorance of de&s;ign, he &s;eldom failed to per&s;uade that part of his audience for who&s;e hearing his ha|rangue was chiefly intended. He was well acquainted with the nature of the public funds, and under&s;tood the whole my&s;tery of &s;tock-jobbing. This know|ledge produced a connexion between him and the money-corporations, which &s;erved to enhance his importance. He perceived the bulk of mankind were actuated by a &s;ordid thir&s;t of lucre; had &s;agacity enough to convert the degene|racy
<PB N="520" REF="5230">
of the times to his own advantage; and on this, and this alone, he founded the whole &s;uper&s;tructure of his &s;ub&s;equent admini&s;tration. In the late reign he had, by dint of &s;peaking deci&s;ively to every que&s;tion, by boldly impeaching the conduct of the Tory mini&s;ters, by his activity in elections, and engaging as a projector in the &s;chemes of the monied-intere&s;t, become a leading member in the hou&s;e of commons. By his &s;ufferings under the Tory parliament, he attained the rank of a martyr to his party: his intere&s;t, his reputation, and his pre&s;ump|tion daily increa&s;ed: he oppo&s;ed Sunderland as his rival in power, and headed a dangerous defection from the mini&s;try, which evinced the greatne&s;s of his influence and authority. He had the glory of being principally concerned in effecting a reconciliation between the late king and the prince of Wales: then he was rea&s;&s;ociated in the admini&s;tration with additional credit; and, from the death of the earls of Sunderland and Stanhope, he had been making long &s;trides towards the office of prime-mini&s;ter. He knew the maxims he had adopted would &s;ubject him to the hatred, the ridicule, and reproach of &s;ome individu|als, who had not yet re&s;igned all &s;entiments of patrioti&s;m, nor all views of op|po&s;ition: but the number of the&s;e was incon&s;iderable when compared to that which con&s;tituted the body of the community; and he would not &s;uffer the con&s;ideration of &s;uch antagoni&s;ts to come in competition with his &s;chemes of power, affluence, and authority. Neverthele&s;s, low as he had humbled an|timini&s;terial a&s;&s;ociation, it required all his artifice to elude, all his patience and natural phlegm, to bear the powerful arguments that were urged, and the keen &s;atire that was exerci&s;ed again&s;t his mea&s;ures and management, by a few members in the oppo&s;ition. Sir William Wyndham po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the energy of elocution; Mr Shippen was calm, intrepid, &s;hrewd, and &s;arca&s;tic; Mr. Hungerford &s;ly, in&s;inuating, and ironical. Mr. W. P. inherited from nature a good un|der&s;tanding, which he had &s;tudiou&s;ly cultivated. He was one of the mo&s;t learned members in the hou&s;e of commons, extremely well qualified to judge of literary productions; well read in hi&s;tory and politics; deeply &s;killed in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, the detail of government, and the nature of the finances. He &s;poke with freedom, fluency, and uncommon warmth of declamation, which was &s;aid to be the effect of per&s;onal animo&s;ity to Sir R. W. with whom he had been formerly connected.</P>

<P>An expre&s;s arriving on the fourteenth day of June with an account of the late king's death, his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty king George II. repaired from Rich|mond, where he received this intelligence, to Leice&s;ter-hou&s;e; and the mem|bers of the privy-council being a&s;&s;embled, were &s;worn a-new. The king de|clared his firm purpo&s;e to pre&s;erve the con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, and to cultivate tho&s;e alliances which his father had made with foreign princes. At the &s;ame time he took and &s;ub&s;cribed the oath for the &s;ecurity of the church of Scotland, as required by the act of union. Next day he was proclaimed king of Great-Britain. The parliament a&s;&s;embled in pur&s;uance of the act made for that purpo&s;e; but was immediately prorogued by commi&s;&s;ion to the twenty-&s;eventh day of the month. All the great officers of &s;tate continued in their places: Sir Robert Walpole kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the trea&s;ury; and the &s;y&s;tem of politics which the late king e&s;tabli&s;hed underwent no &s;ort of alteration. The king, in his &s;peech to both hou&s;es at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, profe&s;&s;ed a fixed re&s;olu|tion to merit the love and affection of his people, by maintaining them in the
<PB N="521" REF="5240">
full enjoyment of their religious and civil rights. He promi&s;ed to le&s;&s;en the public expence as &s;oon as the circum&s;tances of affairs would permit: he ob|&s;erved to the commons, that the grant of the greate&s;t part of the civil li&s;t re|venues was now determined; and, that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for them to make a new provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of him and his family: and he recommended it to both hou&s;es to di&s;patch the bu&s;ine&s;s that &s;hould be nece&s;&s;arily brought before them, as the &s;ea&s;on of the year and the circum&s;tances of time required their pre|&s;ence in the country. Addre&s;&s;es of condolance and congratulation being drawn up and pre&s;ented, the commons, in a committee of the whole hou&s;e, took into con&s;ideration a motion for a &s;upply to his maje&s;ty. Sir Robert Walpole hav|ing ob&s;erved, that the annual &s;um of &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds granted to and &s;ettled on the late king, had fallen &s;hort every year; and, that his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty's expences were likely to increa&s;e by rea&s;on of the largene&s;s of his family, moved, that the intire revenues of the civil li&s;t, which produced about eight hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum, &s;hould be &s;ettled on the king during his life. Mr. Shippen oppo&s;ed this motion, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them as repre&s;entatives of the people, who ought to be very frugal in exerci&s;ing the right of giving away the public money. He &s;aid, the &s;um of &s;even hun|dred thou&s;and pounds was not obtained for his late maje&s;ty without a long and &s;olemn debate; and every member who contended for it at that time, allowed it to be an ample royal revenue: that, although his maje&s;ty's family &s;hould be enlarged, a circum&s;tance which had been urged as one rea&s;on for the mo|tion, he pre&s;umed the appointments of prince Frederick would be much in|ferior to tho&s;e &s;ettled on his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty when he was prince of Wales; be|&s;ides, it was to be hoped, that many per&s;onal, many particular expences in the late reign, e&s;pecially tho&s;e for frequent journies to Hanover, would be di&s;con|tinued, and intirely cea&s;e. He ob&s;erved, that the civil li&s;t branches in the qneen's reign did not often exceed the &s;um of five hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds; neverthele&s;s, &s;he called upon her parliament but once in a reign of thirteen years, to pay the debts contracted in her civil government; and, the&s;e were occa&s;ioned by the unparalelled in&s;tances of her piety and genero&s;ity. She gave the fir&s;t-fruits and tenths, ari&s;ing to nineteen thou&s;and pounds a-year, as an augmentation of the maintenance of the poor clergy. She be&s;towed five thou|&s;and pounds per annum, out of the po&s;t-office, on the duke of Marlborough: &s;he &s;uffered &s;even hundred pounds to be charged weekly on the &s;ame office, for the &s;ervice of the public: &s;he expended &s;everal hundred thou&s;and pounds in building the ca&s;tle of Blenheim: &s;he allowed four thou&s;and pounds annually to prince Charles of Denmark: &s;he &s;u&s;tained great lo&s;&s;es by the tin-contract: &s;he &s;upported the poor Palatines: &s;he exhibited many other proofs of royal bounty, and, immediately before her death, &s;he had formed a plan of retrenchment; which would have reduced her yearly expences to four hundred and fifty-nine thou&s;and nine hundred and forty-one pounds. He affirmed, that a million a-year would not be &s;ufficient to carry on the exorbitant expences, &s;o often and &s;o ju&s;tly complained of in the hou&s;e of commons: that over and above the yearly allowance of &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds, many occa&s;ional taxes, many ex|ce&s;&s;ive &s;ums were rai&s;ed, and all &s;unk in the bottomle&s;s gulph of &s;ecret &s;ervice. Two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds were rai&s;ed in defiance of the antient parlia|mentary methods, to &s;ecure the kingdom from a Swedi&s;h inva&s;ion: then the
<PB N="522" REF="5250">
two in&s;urance offices were erected, and payed near three hundred thou&s;and pounds for their charters: our enmity with Sweden being changed into alliance, a &s;ub|&s;idy of &s;eventy-two thou&s;and pounds was implicitly granted, to fulfil &s;ome &s;ecret engagement with that crown: four and twenty thou&s;and pounds were given for burning merchant &s;hips arrived from infected places, though the goods, which ought to have been de&s;troyed for the public &s;afety, were afterwards privately &s;old: a &s;um of five hundred thou&s;and pounds was demanded and granted, for paying the debts of the civil li&s;t; and his maje&s;ty declared, by me&s;&s;age, he was re&s;olved to retrench his expences for the future. Notwith&s;tanding this re&s;olu|tion, in le&s;s than four years, a new demand of the like &s;um was made and granted, to di&s;charge new incumbrances: the Spani&s;h &s;hips of war which ad|miral Byng took in the Mediterranean, were &s;old for a con&s;iderable &s;um of money: one hundred and twenty-five thou&s;and pounds were granted in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, to be &s;ecretly di&s;po&s;ed of for the public utility; and there was &s;till a debt in the civil government, amounting to above &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds. He took notice, that this amazing extravagance happened under the conduct of per&s;ons pretending to &s;urpa&s;s all their predece&s;&s;ors in the knowledge and care of the public revenue: that as none of the&s;e &s;ums had been accounted for, they were, in all probability, employed in &s;ervices not fit to be owned. He &s;aid, he heartily wi&s;hed that time, the great di&s;coverer of hidden truths, and concealed iniquities, might produce a li&s;t of all &s;uch as had been perverted from their public duty by private pen&s;ions; who had been the hired &s;laves, and the cor|rupt in&s;truments of a profu&s;e and vain-glorious admini&s;tration. He propo&s;ed, that in&s;tead of granting an addition to the civil li&s;t, they &s;hould re&s;trict that re|venue to a certain &s;um, by concluding the que&s;tion with the&s;e words, <Q>&startq;in like manner as they were granted and continued to his late maje&s;ty, &s;o as to make up the clear yearly &s;um of &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds.&endq;</Q> To the&s;e par|ticulars, which were indeed unan&s;werable, no reply was made. Even this mark of decency was layed a&s;ide as idle and &s;uperfluous. The hou&s;e agreed to the motion; and a bill was brought in for the better &s;upport of his maje&s;ty's hou&s;hold. The commons having received a me&s;&s;age from the king, de&s;iring they would make further provi&s;ion for the queen his con&s;ort, re&s;olved, That in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould &s;urvive his maje&s;ty, the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be &s;ettled upon her for life, charged upon the revenues of the civil li&s;t, together with his maje&s;ty's palace of Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, and Richmond Old Park. A bill was formed on this re&s;olution, which, as well as the other, pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es; and received the royal a&s;&s;ent on the &s;eventeenth day of July, when the king, in a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction with their conduct; and congratulated them upon the wealth and glory of the nation, by which they had acquired &s;uch weight in holding the ballance of Europe. Then the lord-chan|cellor prorogued the parliament to the twenty-ninth day of Augu&s;t; but on the &s;eventh of that month a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued for di&s;&s;olving this and con|voking another.</P>

<P>In the interim &s;ome changes were made in different departments of civil oeconomy. Lord vi&s;count Torrington was placed at the head of the ad|miralty: the earl of We&s;tmoreland was appointed fir&s;t lord-commi&s;&s;ioner of trade and plantations. Philip Dormer Stanhope, earl of Che&s;terfield, a nobleman remarkable for his wit, eloquence, and poli&s;hed manners, was nominated am|ba&s;&s;ador
<PB N="523" REF="5260">
to the Hague. The privy-council being di&s;&s;olved, another was appointed of the members then pre&s;ent. The duke of Devon&s;hire was dignified with the place of pre&s;ident; and the duke of St. Alban's was ap|pointed ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e. On the eleventh day of October the coronation of the king and queen was performed at We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, with the u&s;ual &s;o|lemnity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King George II. a&s;cended the throne in the forty-fourth year of his age. On the &s;econd day of September, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and five, he e&s;pou&s;ed the prince&s;s Wilhelmina Charlotte Caroline, daughter to John Frederick marquis of Brandenburgh-An&s;pach, by whom he had two &s;ons, Frederic Lewis prince of Wales, born at Hanover on the thirty-fir&s;t day of January, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;even; and William Augu&s;tus, born at London on the fifteenth day of April, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-one: &s;he had likewi&s;e borne four prince&s;&s;es, namely, Anne, Amelia, Carolina, Mary, and was afterwards delivered of Loui&s;a, married in the &s;equel to the king of Denmark.</NOTE>. By this time the courts of France and Spain were perfectly recon|ciled: all Europe was freed from the calamities of war; and the peace of Great-Britain &s;uffered no interruption, except from &s;ome tran&s;ient tumults among the tinners of Cornwal, who, being provoked by a &s;carcity of corn, ro&s;e in arms, and plundered the granaries of that county.</P>

<P>The elections in England and Scotland for the parliament having &s;uc|ceeded on the new &s;y&s;tem, according to the wi&s;hes of the mini&s;try, the two hou&s;es met on the twenty-third day of January, when the commons unanimou&s;ly cho&s;e for their &s;peaker Arthur On&s;low e&s;quire, knight of the &s;hire for Surrey, a gentleman of exten&s;ive knowledge, worth, and probity, grave, eloquent, ve|nerable, and every way qualified for the di&s;charge of that honourable and im|portant office. The king, in his &s;peech to this new parliament, declared, that by the la&s;t advices from abroad, he had rea&s;on to hope the difficulties which had hitherto retarded the execution of the preliminaries, and the opening of the congre&s;s, would &s;oon be intirely removed: in the mean time he repre&s;ented the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of continuing the preparations which had hitherto &s;ecured the nation, and prevented an open rupture in Europe. He promi&s;ed, that his fir&s;t care &s;hould be to reduce from time to time the expence of the public, as often, and as &s;oon as the intere&s;t and &s;afety of his people would permit &s;uch reduction. He expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire of &s;eeing the foundation layed of an effectual &s;cheme for the increa&s;e and encouragement of &s;eamen in general, that they might be invited rather than compelled into the &s;ervice of their country. Fi|nally, he recommended unanimity, zeal, and di&s;patch of the public bu&s;ine&s;s. Tho&s;e &s;peeches, penned by the mini&s;ter, were compo&s;ed with a view to &s;oothe the minds of the people into an immediate concurrence with the mea&s;ures of the government; but without any intention of performing tho&s;e promi&s;es of oeco|nomy, reformation, and national advantage. The two hou&s;es &s;eemed to vie with each other in expre&s;&s;ions of applau&s;e and affection to his maje&s;ty. The lords, in their addre&s;s, hailed him as the be&s;t of kings, and true father of his country. The commons expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t &s;en&s;e of gratitude for the ble&s;|&s;ings they enjoyed in his reign, though it was not yet eight months old. They approved of all his tran&s;actions; promi&s;ed to &s;upport him in all his undertak|ings; and declared they would chearfully grant whatever &s;upplies &s;hould be wanted for the public &s;ervice. Having con&s;idered the e&s;timates which were
<PB N="524" REF="5270">
layed before them by order of his maje&s;ty, they voted two and twenty thou|&s;and, nine hundred and fifty-five men for guards and garri&s;ons; and fifteen thou|&s;and &s;eamen for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year. They granted two hundred and thirty thou&s;and, nine hundred and twenty-three pounds, for the main|tenance of twelve thou&s;and He&s;&s;ian troops; a &s;ub&s;idy of fifty thou&s;and pounds to the king of Sweden; and half that &s;um to the duke of Brun&s;wick Wolfembuttle. The expence of the year amounted to four millions, rai&s;ed by a land-tax of three &s;hillings in the pound, a malt-tax, and by borrowing of the bank one million, &s;even hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds; for which annuities to the amount of &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds, to be rai&s;ed by duties on coals im|ported into the city of London, were granted to that corporation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VI.</HEAD>
<P>All the&s;e &s;ums, however, were not granted without que&s;tion. The number of land forces occa&s;ioned a debate; and the He&s;&s;ian auxiliaries were not allowed without di&s;pute and oppo&s;ition. When they deliberated on the loan of the bank, Mr. W. Pulteney ob&s;erved, that the &s;hifting of funds was but perpetuating taxes, and putting off the evil day: that notwith&s;tanding the great merit which &s;ome per&s;ons had built on the &s;inking fund, it appeared that the national debt had been increa&s;ed &s;ince the &s;etting-up that pompous project. Some warm altercation pa&s;&s;ed between him and Sir Robert Walpole on this &s;ubject. The lord-mayor, aldermen, and common-council of London, pre&s;ented a peti|tion, &s;etting forth, that the duties already layed upon coals and culm imported into London, affected the trade of that city only; that the inequality of the burthen was a great di&s;couragement to their manufactures, and an hard&s;hip upon all the tracing inhabitants. The petition was rejected, and the tax im|po&s;ed. The hou&s;e having addre&s;&s;ed the king for a particular and di&s;tinct ac|count of the di&s;tribution of two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds, charged to have been i&s;&s;ued for &s;ecuring the trade and navigation of the kingdom, and pre&s;erving and re&s;toring the peace of Europe; he declined granting their reque&s;t, but &s;ignified in general, that part of the money had been i&s;&s;ued and di&s;bur&s;ed by his late maje&s;ty, and the remainder by him&s;elf, for carrying on the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices, which required the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy. Such a me&s;&s;age in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An$ Ch. 1728.</NOTE> reign of king William would have rai&s;ed a dangerous flame in the hou&s;e of commons. Mr. W. Pulteney inveighed again&s;t &s;uch a vague and general way of accounting for the public money, as tending to render parliaments altogether in&s;ignificant, to cover embezzlements, and to &s;creen corrupt and rapacious mini|&s;ters. The commons having taken into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the national debt, examined the accounts, and interrogated the proper officers; a motion was made by a court-member, that it appeared the monies already i&s;&s;ued and applied towards di&s;charging the national debts, together with a &s;um to be i&s;&s;ued at Lady|day, amounted to &s;ix millions &s;ix hundred forty-eight thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-two pounds, five &s;hillings, one penny, one farthing. In vain did the leaders of the oppo&s;ition expo&s;e the fallacious tendency of this motion. In vain did they demon&s;trate the fraudulent artifice u&s;ed in drawing up the accounts: the motion was carried; and &s;everal re&s;olutions were taken on the &s;tate of the national debts. In the particular account of the&s;e debts, upon which the hou&s;e re&s;olved to form a repre&s;entation to his maje&s;ty, an article of three hundred thou&s;and pounds relating to the duty upon wrought plate, was totally omitted. This extraordinary omi&s;&s;ion being di&s;covered, gave ri&s;e to a very warm debate,
<PB N="525" REF="5280">
and to very &s;evere reflections again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;uperintended the public accounts. This error being rectified, a committee appointed for the purpo&s;e drew up the repre&s;entation, containing a particular detail of the national debts di&s;charged and incurred &s;ince the twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixteen, with a &s;tate of the &s;inking fund and of the public credit. The draught being approved by the hou&s;e, was pre&s;ented to the king, who received it graciou&s;ly. He took this opportunity of &s;aying, that the pro|vi&s;ion made for gradually di&s;charging the national debt was now become &s;o certain and con&s;iderable, that nothing but &s;ome unfore&s;een event could alter or dimini&s;h it: a circum&s;tance that afforded the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the old debts di&s;charged, without any nece&s;&s;ity of incurring new incumbrances.</P>

<P>This an&s;wer, fraught with many other expre&s;&s;ions of fatherly tender|ne&s;s for his people, paved the way for a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e, demanding a vote of credit to fulfil certain engagements entered into, and concerted with the ad|vice and concurrence of the la&s;t parliament, for &s;ecuring the trade and naviga|tion of the kingdom, and for re&s;toring and pre&s;erving the peace of Europe. Though a debate en&s;ued upon this me&s;&s;age, the majority re&s;olved that an ad|dre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, declaring the duty and fidelity of the commons, their entire confidence in his royal care and goodne&s;s, and their readine&s;s to enable his maje&s;ty to fulfil his engagements. A vote of credit pa&s;&s;ed accordingly. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the peers were chiefly employed in examining copies of &s;everal treaties and alliances which the king &s;ubmitted to their peru&s;al: they likewi&s;e prepared a bill for amending the &s;tatute of limita|tion, which however did not pa&s;s into a law: they con&s;idered the &s;tate of the national debt a &s;ubject fruitful of debates: they pa&s;&s;ed the mutiny-bill, and tho&s;e that were &s;ent up from the commons, touching the &s;upplies; together with an act, obliging &s;hips arriving from infected places to perform quarentine; and &s;ome others of a more private nature. The&s;e bills having received the royal a&s;&s;ent, the king clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion on the twenty-eighth day of May, when he thanked the commons for the effectual &s;upplies they had rai&s;ed, and in particular, for having impowered him to borrow five hundred thou&s;and pounds for the di&s;charge of wages due to the &s;eamen employed in the navy.</P>

<P>England was at this period quite barren of remarkable events. The king's uncle Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus, prince of Brun&s;wic, duke of York and bi&s;hop of O&s;nabrug, died on the third day of Augu&s;t, and was &s;ucceeded in the bi&s;hop|ric by the elector of Cologn, according to the pactum by which O&s;nabrug is alternately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wic and that elector. In the be|ginning of December, his maje&s;ty's elde&s;t &s;on prince Frederic arrived in Eng|land from Hanover, where he had hitherto re&s;ided; was introduced into the privy council, and created prince of Wales. Signior Como, re&s;ident from the duke of Parma, was ordered to quit the kingdom, becau&s;e his ma&s;ter payed to the pretender the honours due to the king of Great-Britain. The congre&s;s opened at Soi&s;&s;ons, for determining all di&s;putes among the powers of Europe, proved ineffectual. Such difficulties occurred in &s;ettling and reconciling &s;o many different preten&s;ions and intere&s;ts, that the contracting parties in the alliance of Hanover, propo&s;ed a provi&s;ional treaty, concerning which no defi|nitive an&s;wer was given as yet by the courts of Vienna and Madrid. The fate of Europe, therefore, continued in &s;u&s;pence: the Engli&s;h fleet lay inactive and
<PB N="526" REF="5290">
rotting in in the We&s;t-Indies: the &s;ailors peri&s;hed mi&s;erably, without daring to avenge their country's wrongs; while the Spani&s;h crui&s;ers committed depreda|tions with impunity on the commerce of Great-Britain. The court of Spain, at this juncture, &s;eemed cold and indifferent with regard to a pacification with England. It had renewed a good under&s;tanding with France, and now &s;trengthened its intere&s;t by a double alliance of marriage with the royal family of Portugal. The i$fa$ta of this hou&s;e was betrothed to the prince of A&s;tu|rias; while the Spani&s;h infanta formerly affianced to the French king, was now matched with the prince of Brazil, elde&s;t &s;on of his Portugue&s;e maje&s;ty. In the month of January, the two courts met in a wooden hou&s;e built over the little river Coya that &s;eparates the two kingdoms, and there the prince&s;&s;es were exchanged.</P>

<P>The parliament of Great-Britain meeting according to their la&s;t pro|rogation on the twenty-fir&s;t day of January, the king in his &s;peech communicated the nature of the negotiation at the congre&s;s; demanded &s;uch &s;upplies as might enable him to act vigorou&s;ly in concert with his allies, provided his endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h an advantageous peace &s;hould mi&s;carry; and he hinted, that the dila|tory conduct of the courts of Vienna and Madrid proceeded in a great mea|&s;ure from the hopes that were given, of creating di&s;contents and divi&s;ions among the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain. This &s;ugge&s;tion was a mini&s;terial artifice to inflame the zeal and re&s;entment of the nation, and intimidate the members in the oppo&s;ition. Accordingly the hint was pur&s;ued, and in the addre&s;&s;es from both hou&s;es, that could not fail of being agreeable, con&s;idering the manner in which they were dictated, particular notice was taken of this article: both peers and commons expre&s;&s;ed their dete&s;tation and abhorrence of tho&s;e, who by &s;uch ba&s;e and unnatural artifices, &s;ugge&s;ted the means of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing their country, and clamoured at the inconveniencies which they them&s;elves had occa&s;ioned. In the&s;e addre&s;&s;es, likewi&s;e, the parliament congratulated his maje&s;ty on the arrival of the prince of Wales in his Briti&s;h dominions; and the commons &s;ent a particular compliment to his royal highne&s;s on that occa&s;ion. The e&s;timates having been examined in the u&s;ual form, the hou&s;e voted fifteen thou&s;and &s;eamen for the en&s;uing year; but the motion for conti|nuing the &s;ame number of land-forces which had been allowed in the preceding year, was not carried without di&s;pute. All the arguments again&s;t a &s;tanding army in time of peace, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and dan|gerous to the liberties of the people, were repeated with great vivacity by Mr. Shippen and Mr. W. Pulteney. The&s;e, however, were an&s;wered and re|pre&s;ented as ab&s;urd, by Mr. Horatio Walpole and Mr. D. two &s;taunch adherents of the mini&s;ter. The fir&s;t had, in de&s;pite of nature, been employed in different negotiations: he was blunt, aukward and &s;lovenly: an ora|tor without eloquence, an amba&s;&s;ador without dignity, and a plenipotentiary without addre&s;s. The other had natural parts and acquired knowledge; $$oke with confidence; and in di&s;pute was vain, &s;arca&s;tic, petulant, and verbo&s;e.</P>

<P>The &s;ub&s;idies to Sweden, He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, and Wolfembuttle, were conti|nued, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll, Mr. Lutwyche, and Mr. Pulteney; which la&s;t ob&s;erved, that as the landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, and the duke of Brun&s;wick Wolfembuttle, u&s;ually maintained a certain number
<PB N="527" REF="5300">
of troops in their pay, it was but rea&s;onable that Great-Britain &s;hould defray no more than the expence of the additional forces which tho&s;e powers had rai&s;ed, in con&s;equence of their conventions with the king of England. Sir Robert Walpole perceiving, that this remark made an impre&s;&s;ion on the hou&s;e, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate his mea&s;ure: he expatiated upon the wi&s;dom of the late king, in concluding the Hanover alliance. He affirmed, that the convention with He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el had prevented a war in the empire, for which the court of Vienna had made great preparations: that the emperor had not only augmented his own forces by the help of Spani&s;h &s;ub&s;idies, but al&s;o retained the troops of three electors; and if he had not been overawed by the He&s;|&s;ians, would certainly have rejected the preliminaries, and all other advances towards a pacification: that therefore they ought not to grudge an expence which had already proved &s;o beneficial to the tranquillity of Europe. Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll replied, that whatever glo&s;s might be put upon &s;uch mea&s;ures, they were repugnant to the maxims by which England in former times had &s;teered and &s;quared its conduct with relation to its intere&s;t abroad: that the navy was the natural &s;trength of Great-Britain; its be&s;t defence and &s;ecurity: but, if in order to avoid a war, they &s;hould be &s;o free-hearted as to buy and maintain the forces of foreign princes, they were never like to &s;ee an end of &s;uch extravagant expences. This gentleman, who exerci&s;ed the office of ma&s;ter of the rolls, had approved him&s;elf a zealous defender of whig principles, was an able law|yer, a &s;en&s;ible &s;peaker, and a con&s;cientious patriot. The &s;upplies were rai&s;ed by a continuation of the land-tax, the duties upon malt, cyder and perry, an additional impo&s;ition on unmalted corn u&s;ed in di&s;tilling, and by &s;ale of annui|ties to the bank, not exceeding fifty thou&s;and pounds per annum.</P>

<P>Petitions were delivered to the hou&s;e of commons from the merchants of London, Liverpool, and Bri&s;tol, complaining of the interruptions they had &s;uffered in their trade for &s;everal years, by the depredations of the Spaniards in the We&s;t-Indies. The&s;e being con&s;idered, the hou&s;e ordered the lords of the admiralty to produce the other memorials of the &s;ame kind which they had received, that they might be layed before the congre&s;s at Soi&s;&s;ons; and ad|dre&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty for copies of all the letters and in&s;tructions which had been &s;ent to admiral Ho&s;ier, and tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded him in the command of the We&s;t-India &s;quadron. Mr. Oglethorpe having been informed of &s;hocking cruelties and oppre&s;&s;ions exerci&s;ed by gaolers upon their pri&s;oners, moved for an examination into the&s;e practices, and was cho&s;en chairman of a committee ap|pointed to enquire into the &s;tate of the gaols of the kingdom. They began with the Fleet-pri&s;on, which they vi&s;ited in a body: there they found Sir Wil|liam Rich, baronet, loaded with irons, by order of Bambridge the warden, to whom he had given &s;ome &s;light cau&s;e of offence. They made a di&s;covery of many inhuman barbarities which had been committed by that ru&s;&s;ian, and detected the mo&s;t iniquitous &s;cenes of fraud, villany, and extortion. When the report was made by the committee, the hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that Thomas Bambridge, acting warden of the Fleet, had wilfully permitted &s;everal debtors to e&s;cape; had been guilty of the mo&s;t notorious breaches of tru&s;t, great ex|tortions, and the highe&s;t crimes and mi&s;demeanours in the execution of his office; that he had arbitrarily and unlawfully loaded with irons, put into dun|geons, and de&s;troyed pri&s;oners for debt, under his charge, treating them in
<PB N="528" REF="5310">
the mo&s;t barbarous and cruel manner, in high violation and contempt of the laws of the kingdom. A re&s;olution of the &s;ame nature pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t John Huggins, e&s;quire, who had been warden of the Fleet-pri&s;on. The hou&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring he would direct his attorney-general forthwith, to pro&s;ecute the&s;e per&s;ons and their accomplices, who were committed pri&s;oners to Newgate. A bill was brought in, di&s;abling Bambridge to execute the office of warden: another for the better regulating the pri&s;on of the Fleet; and for more effectual preventing and puni&s;hing arbitrary and illegal practices of the warden of the &s;aid pri&s;on.</P>

<P>Other merchants complained by petition of the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the Spaniards. The hou&s;e, in a grand committee, deliberated on this &s;ubject, inquired into the particulars, examined evidence, and drew up an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring his maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to u&s;e his utmo&s;t en|deavours for preventing &s;uch depredations; for procuring ju&s;t and rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction; and for &s;ecuring to his &s;ubjects the free exerci&s;e of commerce and navigation to and from the Briti&s;h colonies in America. The king a&s;&s;ured them he would u&s;e his be&s;t endeavours to an&s;wer the de&s;ires and expectations of his people, in an affair of &s;o much importance: and they, in another addre&s;s, thanked him for his gracious an&s;wer. They did not, however, receive &s;uch a &s;atisfactory reply to a former addre&s;s, touching the &s;um of &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds that had been &s;tated in the public account, without &s;pecification of the particular u&s;es to which it was applied. He told them the money had been i&s;&s;ued and di&s;bur&s;ed for &s;ecret &s;ervices; and, that a di&s;tinct and particular account of the di&s;tribution of it could not be given without a manife&s;t prejudice to the public. A bill was prepared for the more effectual preventing bribery and corruption in elections for members of parliament; and it pa&s;&s;ed through the hou&s;e without oppo&s;ition: but, their attention was chiefly employed upon the Spani&s;h depre|dations, which had rai&s;ed a great clamour through the whole kingdom, and excited very warm di&s;putes in parliament; for they were generally reputed the fruits of negligence, incapacity, or want of vigour in the mini&s;ters. The com|mons having made further progre&s;s in the inquiry, and received fre&s;h petitions from the merchants, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome re&s;olutions, in which the Spaniards were ac|cu&s;ed of having violated the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two crowns; and with having treated inhumanly the ma&s;ters and crews of &s;hips belonging to Great-Britain. They ju&s;tified the in&s;tructions given to admiral Ho&s;ier to &s;eize and detain the flota and galleons of Spain, until ju&s;tice and &s;atisfaction &s;hould be rendered to his maje&s;ty and his allies; nay, even declared, that &s;uch &s;eizure would have been ju&s;t, prudent, and nece&s;&s;ary, tending to prevent an open rup|ture; and to pre&s;erve the peace and tranquillity of Europe.$ They again ad|dre&s;&s;ed the king, to u&s;e his endeavours to procure &s;atisfaction; and he promi&s;ed to comply with their reque&s;t.</P>

<P>Mr. Scrope, member for Bri&s;tol, moved for an addre&s;s, intreating his maje&s;ty to order an account of the produce of the civil li&s;t revenues for one year to be layed before the hou&s;e. The addre&s;s was pre&s;ented, the account pro|duced; and the hou&s;e, in a grand committee, took this affair into con&s;ideration. The courtiers affirmed, that they fell &s;hort of the eight hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;ettled upon his maje&s;ty; and Mr. Scrope propo&s;ed, that the &s;um of one hundred and fifteen thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be granted to the king, on account of tho&s;e
<PB N="529" REF="5320">
deficiencies and arrears. The motion was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Mr. Pulten$y and other members. They expre&s;&s;ed their &s;urprize that it &s;hould be made &s;o late in the &s;e&s;&s;ion, when no further demand of money could be rea&s;onably ex|pected; and they &s;aid, it was the more extraordinary, becau&s;e it appeared in the former &s;e&s;&s;ion, from the examination of the accounts then before the hou&s;e, that the revenues of the civil-li&s;t produced yearly a much greater &s;um than that for which they were given. Mr. Pulteney moved, that the accounts and papers &s;hould be referred to the examination of a &s;elect committee, properly impowered to inve&s;tigate the truth. The mini&s;ters oppo&s;ed this motion; and the que&s;tion being put, it pa&s;&s;ed in the negative. The majority voted the &s;um demanded; and in a bill for &s;ettling the price of imported corn, they in&s;erted the re&s;olution for granting to his maje&s;ty the &s;um of one hundred and fifteen thou&s;and pounds, on account of arrears due on the civil li&s;t revenues.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e of lords having prepared a bill for the more effectual pu|ni&s;hment of forgery, which was pa&s;&s;ed into a law, and ordered the judges to bring in another, on the report of a committee appointed to con&s;ider the ca&s;e of impri&s;oned debtors; at length, deliberated upon the &s;tate of the nation, parti|cularly, the po&s;itive demand made by the court of Spain for the re&s;titution of Gibraltar, grounded on a letter written by the late king to his catholic maje&s;ty. From a copy of the letter layed before the hou&s;e, it plainly appeared, that king George I. had con&s;ented to this re&s;titution. A motion being made for a re&s;olution, importing, that for the honour of his maje&s;ty, and the pre&s;ervation and &s;ecurity of the trade and commerce of the kingdom, effectual care &s;hould be taken in the pre&s;ent treaty, that the king of Spain &s;hould renounce all claim and preten|&s;ion to Gibraltar and Minorca, in plain and &s;trong terms; a debate en&s;ued, and the que&s;tion being put, pa&s;&s;ed in the negative, though not without a prote&s;t. Then the majority re&s;olved, That the hou&s;e did entirely rely upon his maje&s;ty, that he would, for maintaining the honour and &s;ecuring the trade of this king|dom, take effectual care in the pre&s;ent treaty, to pre&s;erve his undoubted right to Gibraltar and Minorca. When the hou&s;e examined the papers relating to the Spani&s;h depredations, many &s;evere reflections were uttered again&s;t the conduct of the mini&s;try; and a motion was made, to re&s;olve, That Ho&s;ier's expedition was an unrea&s;onable burthen on the nation; but, this too was rejected, and oc|ca&s;ioned another prote&s;t. Nor did the clau&s;e in the corn-bill, for granting one hundred and fifteen thou&s;and pounds to his maje&s;ty, pa&s;s through the hou&s;e of peers without warm oppo&s;ition. Divers lords alledged, that in&s;tead of a defici|ency in the civil li&s;t revenues, there was a con&s;iderable &s;urplus: that this was a new grant, and a new burden on the people: that the nation was loaded, not to complete, but to augment the &s;um de&s;igned for the civil-li&s;t; and this at a time when the public debts were increa&s;ed; when the taxes were heavily felt in all parts of the country; when the foreign trade of Britain was incumbered and dimini&s;hed; when her manufactures were decayed; her poor multiplied; and &s;he was &s;urrounded by many other national calamities. They ob&s;erved, that if the produce of the civil-li&s;t revenue &s;hould not amount to the yearly &s;um of eight hundred thou&s;and pounds, the deficiency mu&s;t be made good to his ma|je&s;ty by the public; whereas no provi&s;ion was made, by which, if the produce of the&s;e revenues &s;hould exceed that &s;um, the &s;urplus could accrue to the bene|fit of the public: that by this precedent, not only real deficiencies were to be
<PB N="530" REF="5330">
made good, but al&s;o &s;upplies were to be given for arrears &s;tanding out at the end of every year, which &s;hould come on before the &s;upplies could be granted, though the &s;upply given to make good arrears in one year, would certainly in|crea&s;e the &s;urplu&s;age$ in another: that the revenues of the civil li&s;t were varia|ble in their own nature; and even when there is no deficiency in the produce, there might be arrears in the receipt: the&s;e might be ea&s;ily increa&s;ed by the management of de&s;igning mini&s;ters, by private directions to receive$s, and by artful methods of &s;tating accounts. All the&s;e arguments, and oth$r objections equally &s;trong and plau&s;ible, again&s;t this uncon&s;cionable and unparliamentary motion, &s;erved only to evince the triumph of the mini&s;try over &s;hame and &s;$n|timent, their contempt of public &s;pirit, and their d$fiance of national $$|proach <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The peers that di&s;tingu$&s;hed them&s;elves in the oppo&s;ition were Beaufort, Strafford, Craven, Fo|$$$, Litchfield, Scarsdale, Gower, Mon$j$y, Plymouth, Bathur$t, Northampton, Coventry, Oxford and Mortimer, Willoughby de Broke, Boyle, and Warrington.</NOTE>.</P>

At the &s;ame time two and thirty private bills were pa&s;&s;ed; then the king expre&s;&s;ed his approbation of the parliament, &s;ignified his intention to vi&s;it his German dominions, and ordered the chancel|lor to prorogue both hou&s;es. His maje&s;ty having appointed the queen regent of the realm, &s;et out for Hanover on the &s;eventeenth day of May, in order to remove a petty mi&s;under&s;tanding which had happened between that electorate and the court of Berlin. Some Hanoverian &s;ubjects had been pre&s;&s;ed or decoyed into the &s;ervice of Pru&s;&s;ia; and the regents of Hanover had &s;eized certain Pru&s;&s;ian officers by way of repri&s;al. The whole united kingdom of Great-Britain at this juncture enjoyed uninterrupted repo&s;e; and commerce continued to increa&s;e, in &s;pite of all re&s;triction and di&s;couragement. The people of Ireland found them|&s;elves happy under the government of lord Carteret; and their parliament, a&s;&s;embling in the month of September, approved them&s;elves the fathers of their country. They e&s;tabli&s;hed funds for the di&s;charge of their national debt, and for maintaining the expence of government: they enacted whole&s;ome laws for the encouragement of manufacture, trade, and agriculture; and they formed wi&s;e regulations in different branches of civil oeconomy. Some time after this &s;e&s;&s;$on, which was conducted with &s;o much harmony and patrioti&s;m, lord Car|teret returned to England; and was &s;ucceeded by the duke of Dor&s;et in the government of that kingdom. In the month of May Charles lord Town&s;hend re&s;igned the &s;eals, which were given to colonel Stanhope, now created earl of Harrington; &s;o that Sir R. W. now reigned without a rival.

He a&s;&s;ured them that all former conventions made with Spain in favour of the Briti&s;h trade and navigation, were renewed and confirmed: that the free uninterrupted exerci&s;e of their commerce was re&s;tored: that the court of Spain had agreed to an ample re&s;ti|tution and reparation for unlawful &s;eizures and depredations: that all rights, privileges, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions belonging to him and his allies, were &s;olemnly re|e&s;tabli&s;hed, confirmed, and guarantied: and that not one conce&s;&s;ion was made to the prejudice of his &s;ubjects. He told them he had given orders for reduc|ing a great number of his land-forces, and for laying up great part of the fleet; and ob&s;erved, that there would be a con&s;iderable &s;aving in the expence of the current year. After both hou&s;es had pre&s;ented their addre&s;&s;es of thanks and congratulation to the king on the peace of Seville, the lords took that treaty into con&s;ideration; and it did not pa&s;s inquiry without &s;evere animadver&s;ion.</P>

<P>The lords in the oppo&s;ition excepted to the article by which the mer|chants of Great-Britain were obliged to make proof of their lo&s;&s;es at the court of Spain. They &s;aid, this &s;tipulation was a hard&s;hip upon Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and di&s;ho|nourable to the nation: that few would care to undertake &s;uch a trouble&s;ome and expen&s;ive journey, e&s;pecially as they had rea&s;on to apprehend their claims would be counterballanced by the Spaniards; and after all, they would have no more but the &s;lender comfort of hoping to obtain that redre&s;s by commi&s;&s;aries which they had not been able to procure by plenipotentiaries. They thought it very extraordinary, that Great-Britain &s;hould be bound to ratify and guaranty whatever agreement &s;hould be made between the king of Spain and the dukes of Parma and Tu&s;cany, concerning the garri&s;ons once e&s;tabli&s;hed in their countries: that the Engli&s;h &s;hould be obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t in effectuating the introduction of &s;ix thou&s;and Spani&s;h troops into the towns of Tu&s;cany and Parma, without any &s;pecification of the methods to be taken, or the charge to be incurred in giving that a&s;&s;i&s;tance: that they &s;hould guaranty for ever, not only to Don Carlos, but even to all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tates of Tu&s;cany and Parma; a &s;tipulation, which, in all probability, would involve Great-Britain in endle&s;s
<PB N="532" REF="5350">
quarrels and di&s;putes, about a country with which they had no concern. They affirmed, that the treaty of Seville, in&s;tead of confirming other treaties, was contradictory to the quadruple alliance, particularly in the article of introduc|ing Spani&s;h troops into Fu&s;cany and Parma, in the room of neutral forces &s;ti|pulated by the former alliance; and agreeing, that they &s;hould there remain until Don Caries and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hould be &s;ecure and exempt from all events. They complained, that the&s;e alterations, from the tenour of the qua|druple alliance, were made without the concurrence of the emperor, and even without inviting him to accede; an affront which might alienate his friend&s;hip from England, and hazard the lo&s;s of &s;uch an antient, powerful, and faithful ally: and, that throughout the whole treaty there &s;eemed to be an artful omi&s;|&s;ion of any expre&s;s &s;tipulation, to &s;ecure Great-Britain in her right to Gibral|tar and Minorca. Such was the &s;ub&s;tance of the objections made to the peace: then lord Bathur&s;t moved for a re&s;olution, that the agreement on the treaty of Seville, to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Don Carlos to the dutchies of Tu&s;cany, Parma, and Placentia, with Spani&s;h troops, was a manife&s;t violation of the fifth article of the quadruple alliance, tending to involve the nation in a dangerous and ex|pen&s;ive war, and to de&s;troy the ballance of power in Europe. The que&s;tion was put, and the motion rejected. Such too was the fate of other two mo|tions, to re&s;olve, That Great-Britain's right of &s;overeignty, dominion, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, and claim to Gibraltar and Minorca, were not a&s;certained by the treaty of Seville: and, That the &s;tipulations in that treaty, for repairing the lo&s;&s;es of the Briti&s;h merchants, were in&s;ufficient and precarious. The majority, far from &s;tigmatizing this tran&s;action, re&s;olved, That the treaty did contain all nece&s;&s;ary &s;tipulations for maintaining and &s;ecuring the honour, dignity, rights, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions of the crown: that all due care was taken therein for the &s;upport of the trade of the kingdom, and for repairing the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the Briti&s;h mer|chants. On the&s;e re&s;olutions an addre&s;s of approbation was founded; but, when a motion was made for an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, that he would order to be layed before the $word$ a li$t of all pen&s;ions payable to the crown, it was im|mediately re&s;olved in the negative. Divers conte&s;ts of the &s;ame kind aro&s;e upon the mutiny-bill, the pen&s;ion-bill, and the maintenance of the twelve thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians; but the mini&s;try bore down all oppo&s;ition, though their triumphs were $l$gged with vigorous prote&s;ts, which did not fail to make impre&s;&s;ion upon the body of the people.</P>

<P>Nor was the &s;ucce&s;s of the court-intere&s;t in the hou&s;e of commons altogether pure and free from exception and di&s;pute. When the charge of the land-forces fell under the con&s;ideration of the commons, and Mr. Henry Pel|ham, &s;ecretary at war, moved, that the number of the effective men for the land-&s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, &s;hould be fixed at &s;eventeen thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and nine; Mr. Pulteney in&s;i&s;ted upon its being reduced to twelve thou|&s;and. Mr. Shippon affirmed, that Mr. Polham's motion was a fiat negative to the addre&s;s for which he voted on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, as it plainly im|plied a di&s;tru&s;t of the validity of the late treaty, which he then a&s;&s;ured the hou&s;e, would immediately produce all the $word$ of an ab&s;olute $eace; and deliver the kingdom from the apprehen&s;ions and $word$ of a war. He &s;aid, the motion tended directly towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an army in Great-Britain, which, he hoped, would never be &s;o far germanized, as tamely to &s;ubmit
<PB N="533" REF="5360">
to a military government. He ob&s;erved, that the nation could have no occa|&s;ion for all the troops that were demanded, con&s;idering the glorious &s;cene of affairs which was now opened to all Europe. <Q>&startq;They are not nece&s;&s;ary (&s;aid he) to awe Spain into a firm adherence to its own treaty: they are not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to force the emperor into an immediate acce&s;&s;ion; nor are they in any &s;ort nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of his maje&s;ty's per&s;on and government. Force and violence are the re&s;ort of u&s;urpers and tyrants only; becau&s;e they are, with good rea&s;on, di&s;tru&s;tful of the people whom they oppre&s;s; and, be|cau&s;e they have no other &s;ecurity for the continuance of their unlawful and unnatural dominion, than what depends entirely on the &s;trength of their ar|mies.&endq;</Q> The motion, however, was carried in the affirmative.</P>

<P>Another warm debate was excited by a bill which the courtiers brought in, to prevent any &s;ubjects of Great-Britain from advancing &s;ums of money to foreign princes or &s;tates, without having obtained licence from his ma|je&s;ty, under his privy-&s;eal, or &s;ome greater authority. The mini&s;ter pretended, that this law was propo&s;ed to di&s;able the emperor, who wanted to borrow a great &s;um of the Engli&s;h merchants, for rai&s;ing and maintaining troops to di&s;|turb the tranquillity of Europe. The bill contained a clau&s;e, impowering the king to prohibit by proclamation, all &s;uch loans of money, jewels, or bullion; and the attorney-general to compel, by Engli&s;h bill, in the court of exchequer, the effectual di&s;covery, on oath, of any &s;uch loans; and, that in default of an an&s;wer to any &s;uch bill, the court &s;hould decree a limited &s;um again&s;t the per&s;on refu&s;ing to an&s;wer. Mr. Daniel Pulteney, a gentleman of uncommon talents and ability, and particularly acquainted with every branch of commerce, argued &s;trenuou&s;ly again&s;t this bill, as a re&s;traint upon trade that would render Hol|land the market of Europe, and the mart of money to the nations of the con|tinent. He &s;aid, that by this general prohibition, extending to all princes, &s;tates, or potentates, the Engli&s;h were totally di&s;abled from a&s;&s;i&s;ting their be&s;t allies: that among others the king of Portugal frequently borrowed money of the Engli&s;h merchants re&s;iding within his dominions: that while the licen&s;ing power remained in the crown, the licences would be i&s;&s;ued through the hands of the mini&s;ter, who by this new trade might gain twenty, thirty, or forty thou&s;and a-year: that the bill would render the exchequer a court of inqui&s;ition; and that whil&s;t it re&s;trained our merchants from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the princes and powers of Europe, it permitted our &s;tock-jobbers to trade in their funds without interrup|tion. Other arguments of equal weight were enforced by Mr. Barnard, a mer|chant of London, who perfectly under&s;tood trade in all its branches, &s;poke with judgment and preci&s;ion, and upon all occa&s;ions &s;teadily adhered to the intere&s;ts and liberties of his country. After having explained his rea&s;ons, he declared he &s;hould never con&s;ent to a bill which he deemed a violation of our fundamen|tal laws, a branch of our deare&s;t liberties, and a very terrible hard&s;hip on man|kind. Sir William Wyndham di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion; but the bill was vindicated by Sir Robert Walpole, Mr. Pelham, and Sir Philip Yorke attorney-general; and being &s;upported by the whole weight of mini&s;terial influence, not only pa&s;&s;ed through the hou&s;e, but was afterwards enacted into a law.</P>

the&s;e extraneous incumbrances; and the &s;upply for the en&s;uing year was granted according to the e&s;timates which the mini&s;try thought proper to produce, amount|ing to about two millions two hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds It mu&s;t be owned, however, for the credit of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, that the hou&s;e appropriated one million of the &s;urplu&s;&s;es, ari&s;ing from the &s;inking fund, towards the di&s;charge of the national debt; and by another act extingui&s;hed the duties upon &s;alt, by which expedient the &s;ubject was ea&s;ed of a heavy burden, not only in being freed from the duty, but al&s;o from a con&s;iderable charge of &s;alaries given to a great number of officers employed to collect this impo&s;ition. They lik$$i&s;e encouraged the colony of Carolina with an act, allowing the planters and traders of that province to export rice directly to any part of Europe &s;outh|ward of Cape Fini&s;tere; and they permitted &s;alt from Europe to be imported into the colony of New York. The term of the exclu&s;ive trade granted by act of parliament to the Ea&s;t-India company$ drawing towards a period, many con&s;iderable m$rchants and others made appli$ation for being incorporated and ve&s;ted with the privilege of trading to tho&s;e countries, propo&s;ing to lay that branch of trade open to all the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, on certain conditions; and in con&s;ideration of an act of parliament for this purpo&s;e, th$y offered to advance three millions two hundred thou&s;and pounds, for redeeming the fund<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This propo&s;al was rejected; and the exclu&s;ive privilege ve&s;ted in the company, was, by act of parliament, protracted to the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix, upon the fol|lowing conditions: That they &s;hould pay into the exchequer the &s;um of two hundred thou&s;and pounds towards the &s;upplies of the year, without intere&s;t or addition to their capital &s;tock: That the annuity or yearly fund of one hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, payable to them from the public, &s;hould be reduced to one hundred and twenty-eight thou&s;and: and, That after the year one thou|&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix, their right to the ex$lu&s;ive trade &s;hould be liable to be taken away by parliament, on three years notice, and repayment of their capital.</P>

<P>On the fifteenth day of May the king went to the hou&s;e of peers, and clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion. In his &s;peech he expre&s;&s;ed his joy, that notwith&s;tanding all the clamours which were rai&s;ed, the parliament had approved of tho&s;e mat|ters which fell under their con&s;ideration; a circum&s;tance, which, he &s;aid, could not fail to in&s;pire all mankind with a ju&s;t dete&s;tation of tho&s;e incendiaries, who, by &s;candalous libels, laboured to alienate the affections of his people; to fill their minds with groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies and unju&s;t complaints, in di&s;honour of him and his government; and in defiance of the &s;en&s;e of both hou&s;es of par|liament <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion the commons rai&s;ed a bill for making more effectual the laws in being, for di&s;abling per&s;ons from being cho&s;en members of parl$ament who enjoyed any pen&s;ion during plea&s;$re, or for any number of years, or any offices holden in tru&s;t for them, by obliging all per&s;ons hereafter to be cho&s;en to &s;erve for the commons in parliament, to take the oath therein mentioned.

<P>In Great-Britain, this year was not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any tran&s;action of great moment. Seven chiefs of the Cherokee nation of Indians in Ame|rica, were brought to England by Sir Alexander Cumin, and introduced to the king, at who&s;e feet they layed their crown and regalia; and by an authentic deed acknowledged them&s;elves &s;ubjects to his dominion, in the name of all their compatriots, who had ve&s;ted them with full powers for this purpo&s;e. They were amazed and confounded at the riches and magnificence of the Briti&s;h court: they compared the king and queen to the &s;un and moon, the princes to the &s;tars of heaven, and them&s;elves to nothing. They gave their a&s;&s;ent in the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn manner to articles of friend&s;hip and commerce, propo&s;ed by the lords commi&s;&s;ioners for trade and plantations: and being loaded with pre&s;ents of ne|ce&s;&s;aries, arms, and ammunition, were reconveyed to their own country, which borders on the province of South Carolina. In the month of September a &s;ur|pri&s;ing revolution was effected at Con&s;tantinople, without blood&s;hed or confu&s;ion. A few mean jani&s;&s;aries di&s;played a flag in the &s;treets, exclaiming, that all true Mu&s;&s;ulmans ought to follow them, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in reforming the government. They &s;oon increa&s;ed to the number of one hundred thou&s;and; marched to the &s;eraglio, and demanded the grand vizir, the kiaja, and captain bachau. The&s;e unhappy mini&s;ters were immediately &s;trangled. Their bodies being delivered to the in&s;ur|gents, were dragged through the &s;treets; and afterwards thrown to the dogs to be devoured. Not contented with this &s;acrifice, the revolters depo&s;ed the grand &s;ignor Achment, who was confined to the &s;ame pri&s;on, from whence they brought his nephew Machmout, and rai&s;ed him to the throne, after he had lived &s;even and twenty years in confinement.</P>

<P>England was at this period infe&s;ted with robbers, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and in|cendiaries, the natural con&s;equences of degeneracy, corruption, and the want of police in the interior government of the kingdom. This defect, in a great mea&s;ure, aro&s;e from an ab&s;urd notion, that laws nece&s;&s;ary to prevent tho&s;e acts of cruelty, violence, and rapine, would be incompatible with the liberty of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; a notion that confounds all di&s;tinctions between liberty and brutal licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as if that freedom was de&s;irable, in the enjoyment of which people find no &s;ecurity for their lives or effects. The peculiar depravity of the times was vi&s;ible even in the conduct of tho&s;e who preyed upon the com|monwealth. Thieves and robbers were now become more de&s;perate and &s;a|vage than ever they had appeared &s;ince mankind were civilized. In the exer|ci&s;e of their rapine, they wounded, maimed, and even murdered the unhappy &s;ufferers, through a wantonne&s;s of barbarity. They circulated letters, demand|ing &s;ums of money from certain individuals, on pain of reducing their hou&s;es to a&s;hes, and their families to ruin; and even &s;et fire to the hou&s;e of a rich mer|chant in Bri&s;tol, who had refu&s;ed to comply with their demand. The &s;ame &s;pecies of villany was practi&s;ed in different parts of the kingdom; &s;o that the

<P>In the &s;peech with which the king opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament on the twenty-fir&s;t day of January, he told them, that the pre&s;ent critical con|juncture &s;eemed in a very particular manner to de&s;erve their attention: that as the tran&s;actions then depending in the &s;everal courts of Europe were upon the point of being determined, the great event of peace or war might be very much af|fected by their fir&s;t re&s;olutions, which were expected by different powers with great impatience. He &s;aid, the continuance of that zeal and vigour with which they had hitherto &s;upported him and his engagements, mu&s;t at this time be of the greate&s;t weight and importance, both with regard to his allies, and to tho&s;e who might be $word$ before the &s;ea&s;on of action, to prevent by an accommo|dation the fatal con&s;equences of a general rupture. The former &s;cene was re|peated. Both hou&s;es, in their addre&s;&s;es, promi&s;ed to &s;upport his maje&s;ty in all his engagements though the members in the oppo&s;ition demon&s;trated the ab|&s;urdity of promi&s;ing to fulfil engagements before they could po&s;&s;ibly know whe|ther or not they were for the &s;ervice of Great-Britain. Another bill was brought into the hou&s;e of commons, to prevent pen&s;ioners from &s;itting as members of parliament; and, after a third reading, carried up to the lords for their concurrence. When the &s;upply fell under con&s;ideration, the debates were re|newed upon the &s;ub&s;idies to the landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el and the duke of Wolfembuttle, which, however, were continued; and every article was granted according to the e&s;timates given in for the expence of the en&s;uing year. Two petitions being pre&s;ented to the commons, repre&s;enting the delays of ju&s;tice, oc|ca&s;ioned by the u&s;e of the Latin tongue in proceedings at law; a bill was brought in for changing this practice, and enacting, that all tho&s;e proce&s;&s;es and pleadings &s;hould be entered in the Engli&s;h language. Though one would imagine, that very little could be advanced again&s;t &s;uch a regulation, the bill met with warm oppo&s;ition, on pretence that it would render u&s;ele&s;s the antient records which were written in that language, and introduce confu&s;ion and de|lay of ju&s;tice, by altering the e&s;tabli&s;hed form and method of pleading; in &s;pite of the&s;e objections it pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, and obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent. A great number of merchants from different parts of the kingdom, having re|peated their complaints of depredations and cruelties committed by the Spani|ards in the We&s;t-Indies; their petitions were referred to the con&s;ideration of a grand committee. Their complaints, upon examination, appeared to be well founded. The hou&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring his maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to continue his endeavour to prevent &s;uch depredations for the future; to procure full &s;atisfaction for the damages already &s;u&s;tained; and to &s;ecure to the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects the full and uninter|rupted exerci&s;e of their trade and navigation to and from the Briti&s;h colonies in America. The bill again&s;t pen&s;ions produced a warm debate in the hou&s;e of lords, where it was violently oppo&s;ed by the dukes of Newca&s;tle and Argyle, the earl of Hay, and Dr. Sherlock bi&s;hop of Bangor. This prelate, in a re|markable &s;peech, repre&s;ented it as a &s;cheme to enlarge the power of the hou&s;e of commons; and to break the ballance between the powers e&s;&s;ential to the con|&s;titution, &s;o as &s;ooner or later to prove the ruin of the whole. The great bar|rier provided again&s;t bribery and corruption by this bill, con&s;i&s;ted in an oath to
<PB N="537" REF="5400">
be impo&s;ed on all members of the lower hou&s;e, by which they mu&s;t have &s;o|lemnly &s;worn and declared, that they had not directly nor indirectly, any pen|&s;ion during plea&s;ure, or for any number of years, or any office in part, or in the whole, held for them or for their benefit, by any per&s;ons what&s;oever; and, that they would not accept any &s;uch pen&s;ions or offices, without &s;ignifying the &s;ame to the hou&s;e within fourteen days after they &s;hould be received or accepted. The bill was vindicated as ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary by the earls of Winchel&s;ea and Strafford, the lord Bathur&s;t, and the lord Carteret, who had by this time joined as an auxiliary in the oppo&s;ition.</P>

They pa&s;&s;ed the bill for carrying on proceedings at law in the Engli&s;h language; and a fruitle&s;s motion was made by the lord Bathur&s;t for an addre&s;s, to de&s;ire his maje&s;ty would give directions for di&s;charging the He&s;&s;ian troops that were in the pay of Great-Britain. On the &s;eventh day of May the parliament was prorogued, after the king had given them to under&s;tand, that all apprehen&s;ions of war were now happily removed, by a treaty &s;igned at Vienna between him and the emperor. He &s;aid it was communicated to the courts of France and Spain, as parties to the treaty of Seville, the execution of which it principally regarded; and, that it was likewi&s;e &s;ubmitted to the con|&s;ideration of the &s;tates-general. He ob&s;erved, that the conditions and engage|ments into which he had entered on this occa&s;ion, were agreeable to that nece&s;|&s;ary concern which the Briti&s;h nation mu&s;t always have for the &s;ecurity and pre|&s;ervation of the ballance of power in Europe: that this happy turn, duly im|proved with a ju&s;t regard to former alliances, yielded a favourable pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the public tranquillity re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

In ca&s;e the child &s;hould be &s;till-born, or die after the birth, he bequeathed his dominions and allodial e&s;tates to the infant Don Carlos of Spain; and appointed five regents to govern the dutchy. Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;po&s;ition, a body of Imperial troops immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Parma and Placentia, under the command of general Stampa, who declared they &s;hould conduct them&s;elves with all po&s;&s;ible regularity and moderation; and leave the admini&s;tration intirely to the regents whom the duke had appointed. They publicly proclaimed in the market-place, that they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e dutchies for the in&s;ant Don Carlos: and, that if the dutche&s;s dowager &s;hould not be delivered of a prince, the &s;aid infant might receive the investiture from the emperor whenever he would, provided he &s;hould come without an army. Though the&s;e &s;teps &s;eemed to threaten an immediate war, the king of Great-Britain and the &s;tates-general interpo&s;ed their mediation &s;o effectually with the court of Vienna, that the emperor de&s;i&s;ted from the pro&s;ecution of his de&s;ign; and on the &s;ixteenth day of March concluded at Vienna a treaty with his Britannic maje&s;ty, by which he con&s;ented to withdraw his troops from Parma and Placentia. He agreed, That the king of Spain might take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e places in fa|vour
<PB N="538" REF="5410">
of his &s;on Don Carlos, according to the treaty of Seville. He likewi&s;e agreed, That the O&s;tend company, which had given &s;uch umbrage to the mari|time powers, &s;hould be totally di&s;&s;olved, on condition that the contracting powers concerned in the treaty of Seville, &s;hould guaranty the pragmatic &s;anction, or &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the Au&s;trian hereditary dominions to the heirs female of the emperor, in ca&s;e he &s;hould die without male i&s;&s;ue. The Dutch mini&s;ter re&s;iding at the Imperial court did not &s;ub&s;cribe this treaty, becau&s;e, by the maxims received in that re|public, and the nature of her government, he could not be ve&s;ted with full power$ &s;o &s;oon as it would have been nece&s;&s;ary: neverthele&s;s, the &s;tates-general were, by a &s;eparate article, expre&s;sly named as a principal contracting party.</P>

<P>On the twenty-&s;econd day of July a new treaty was &s;igned at Vienna between the emperor, the kings of Great-Britain and Spain, tending to confirm the former. In Augu&s;t a treaty of union and defen&s;ive alliance between the electorates of Saxony and Hanover was executed at Dre&s;$en. The court of Spain expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome doubts with regard to the pregnancy of the dutche&s;s of Parma, &s;he underwent a formal examination by five midwives of different na|tions, in pre&s;ence of the older dutche&s;s dowager, &s;everal ladies of quality, three phy&s;icians, and a &s;urgeon; and was declared with child: neverthele&s;s, after having kept all Europe in &s;u&s;pence for &s;ix months, &s;he owned &s;he had been de|ceived; and general Stampa with the Imperial forces took formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the dutchies of Parma and Placentia. Spain and the great duke of Tu&s;cany having acceded to the la&s;t treaty of Vienna, the crown of Great-Britain engaged to equip an armament that &s;hould convoy Don Carlos to his new dominions. Accordingly Sir Charles Wager &s;ailed with a &s;trong &s;quadron from Port&s;mouth on the twenty-&s;ixth day of Augu&s;t; and in September arrived at Barcelona, where being joined by the Spani&s;h fleet and tran&s;ports, they &s;ailed together to Leghorn; from whence the admiral returned to England. Don Carlos pa&s;&s;ed through part of France, and embarking at Antibes on board of the Spani&s;h gal|lies, arrived at Leghorn in December. Then the Imperial general withdrew his forces into the Milaneze; and the infant took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new territories.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions France was di&s;tracted by religious di&s;|putes, occa&s;ioned by the bull unigenitus thundered again&s;t the doctrines of Jan|&s;enius; a bull which had produced a &s;chi&s;m in the Gallican church, and well nigh involved that country in civil war and confu&s;ion. It was oppo&s;ed by the parliaments and lay-tribunals of the kingdom; but, many bi&s;hops, and the $e&s;uits in general, were its mo&s;t &s;trenuous a&s;&s;ertors. All the artifices of prie&s;t|craft were practi&s;ed on both &s;ides, to inflame the enthu&s;ia&s;m, and manage the &s;uper&s;tition of the people. Pretended miracles were wrought at the tomb of abbe Paris, who had died without accepting the bull, con&s;equently was declared damned by the abettors of that con&s;titution. On the other hand, the je&s;uits exerted all their abilities and indu&s;try in preaching again&s;t the Jan&s;eni&s;ts; in e&s;ta|blishing an opinion of their &s;uperior &s;anctity; and in&s;piring a &s;pirit of quieti&s;m among their votaries, who were tran&s;ported into the delirium of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, illu|mination, and &s;upernatural conver&s;e. The&s;e arts were often u&s;ed for the mo&s;t infamous purpo&s;es. Female enthu&s;ia&s;ts were wrought up to &s;uch violence of agitations, that nature fainted under the &s;truggle; and the p&s;eudo-&s;aint &s;eized this opportunity of violating the cha&s;tity of his penitent. Such was &s;aid to be the ca&s;e of mademoi&s;elle la Cadiere, a young gentlewoman of Toulon, abu&s;ed

<P>The parliament of Great-Britain meeting on the thirteenth day of January, the king in his &s;peech declared, that the general tranquillity of Eu|rope was re&s;tored and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the la&s;t treaty of Vienna: that Don Carlos was actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Parma and Placentia: that &s;ix thou&s;and Spaniards were quietly admitted and quartered in the dutchy of Tu&s;cany, to &s;ecure, by the ex|pre&s;s con&s;ent and agreement of the great duke, the rever&s;ion of his dominions: and, that a family-convention was made between the courts of Spain and Tu&s;|cany, for pre&s;erving mutual peace and friend&s;hip in the two hou&s;es. He told the commons, that the e&s;timates for the &s;ervice of the current year would be con&s;iderably le&s;s than tho&s;e of former years. He recommended unanimity: he ob&s;erved, that his government had no &s;ecurity but what was equally conducive to their happine&s;s, and to the protection of his people: that their pro&s;perity had no foundation but in the defence and &s;upport of his government. <Q>&startq;Our &s;afety (&s;aid he) is mutual, and our intere&s;ts are in&s;eparable.&endq;</Q> The oppo&s;ition to the court mea&s;ures appears to have been uncommonly &s;pirited during the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion. The mini&s;ter's motions were attacked with all the artillery of elo|cution. His principal emi&s;&s;aries were obliged to ta&s;k their faculties to their full exertion, to puzzle and perplex where they could not demon&s;trate and convince; to mi&s;repre&s;ent what they could not vindicate, and elude the arguments which they could not refute. In the hou&s;e of commons lord Hervey, lately appointed vice-chamberlain of his maje&s;ty's hou&s;hold, made a motion for an addre&s;s of thanks, in which they &s;hould declare their intire approbation of the king's con|duct; acknowledge the ble&s;&s;ings they enjoyed under his government; expre&s;s their confidence in the wi&s;dom of his coun&s;els; and, declare their readine&s;s to grant the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. This member, &s;on to the earl of Bri&s;tol, was a nobleman of &s;ome parts, which, however, were more &s;pecious than &s;olid. He conde&s;cended to act as a &s;ubaltern to the mini&s;ter, and approved him&s;elf extremely active in forwarding all his de&s;igns, whether as a &s;ecret emi&s;&s;ary, or public orator; in which la&s;t capacity he appears to have been pert, frivolous, and &s;rothy. His motion was &s;econded by Mr. Clutterbuck, and oppo&s;ed by Sir Wilfred Law&s;on, Mr. Shippen, Mr. W. Pulteney, Sir William Wyndham, and Mr. Oglethorpe. They did not argue again&s;t a general addre&s;s of thanks; but, ex|po&s;ed the ab&s;urdity and bad tendency of expre&s;&s;ions which implied a blind ap|probation of all the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try. Sir Wilfred Law&s;on ob&s;erved, that notwith&s;tanding the great things we had done for the crown of Spain, and the favours we had procured for the royal family of that kingdom, little or no &s;atisfaction had as yet been received for the injuries our merchants had &s;u&s;tained from that nation. Mr. Pulteney took notice, that the nation, by becoming gua|ranty to the pragmatic &s;anction, layed it&s;elf under an obligation to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Au&s;trian family when attacked by any potentate whatever, except the grand &s;ignor: that they might be attacked when it would be much again&s;t the intere&s;t of the kingdom to engage it&s;elf in a war upon any foreign account: that it might one day be for the intere&s;t of the nation to join again&s;t them, in order to pre|&s;erve the ballance of Europe, the e&s;tabli&s;hing of which had already co&s;t Eng|land
<PB N="540" REF="5430">
&s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums of money. He in&s;i&s;ted upon the ab&s;urdity of conclud|ing &s;uch a number of incon&s;i&s;tent treaties; and concluded with &s;aying, that if affairs abroad were now happily e&s;tabli&s;hed, the mini&s;try which conducted them might be compared to a pilot, who, though there was a clear, &s;afe, and &s;traight channel into port, yet took it in his head to carry the &s;hip a great way about, through &s;ands, rocks, and &s;hallows; who, after having lo&s;t a great number of &s;eamen, de&s;troyed a great deal of tackle and rigging, and &s;ubjected the owners to an enormous expence, at la&s;t, by chance, hits the port, and triumphs in his good conduct. Sir William Wyndham &s;poke to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Mr. Oglethorpe, a gentleman of unblemi&s;hed character, brave, generous, and humane, affirmed, that many other things related more nearly to the honour and intere&s;t of the nation, than did the guaranty of the pragmatic &s;anction. He &s;aid, he wi&s;hed to have heard that the new works at Dunkirk had been intirely razed and de&s;troyed: that the nation had received full and complete &s;atisfaction for the depredations committed by the natives of Spain: that more care was taken in di&s;ciplining the militia, on who&s;e valour the nation mu&s;t chiefly depend in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion; and, that &s;ome regard had been &s;hewn to the oppre&s;&s;ed prote&s;tants in Germany. He expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction to find that the Engli&s;h were not &s;o clo&s;ely united to France as formerly; for he had generally ob&s;erved, that when two dogs were in a lea&s;h together, the &s;tronger generally ran away with the weaker; and this, he was afraid, had been the ca&s;e between France and Great-Britain. The motion was vigorou&s;ly defended by Mr. Pelham, pay|ma&s;ter of the forces, and brother to the duke of Newca&s;tle, a man who&s;e greate&s;t fault was his being concerned in &s;upporting the mea&s;ures of a corrupt mini&s;try. In other re&s;pects he was liberal, candid, benevolent, and even at|tached to the intere&s;t of his country, though egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken in his notions of government. On this occa&s;ion he a&s;&s;erted, that it was no way incon&s;i&s;tent with the honour or dignity of that hou&s;e, to thank his maje&s;ty in the mo&s;t particular terms for every thing he had been plea&s;ed to communicate in his &s;peech from the throne: that no expre&s;&s;ions of approbation in the addre&s;s could be any way made u&s;e of to prevent an inquiry into the mea&s;ures which had been pur&s;ued, when the treaties &s;hould be layed before the hou&s;e. He &s;aid, at the opening of a &s;e&s;&s;ion the eyes of all Europe were turned towards Great-Britain, and from the parliament's fir&s;t re&s;olves, all the neighbouring powers judged of the unanimity that would en&s;ue between his maje&s;ty and the repre&s;entatives of his people: that their appearing jealous or diffident of his maje&s;ty's con|duct, would weaken his influence upon the councils of foreign &s;tates and potentates, and perhaps put it out of his power to rectify any fal&s;e &s;tep that might have been made by his mini&s;ters. His arguments were reinforced by a long &s;peech from Mr. H. Walpole. The que&s;tion was put, the motion carried, and the addre&s;s pre&s;ented.</P>

<P>The next &s;ubject of debate was the number of land-forces. When the &s;upply fell under con&s;ideration, Sir W. Strickland, &s;ecretary at war, moved, that the &s;ame number which had been maintained in the preceding year &s;hould be continued in pay. On the other hand, lord Morpeth having demon|&s;trated the danger to which the liberties of the nation might be expo&s;ed, by main|taining a numerous &s;tanding army in time of peace, made a motion that the
<PB N="541" REF="5440">
number &s;hould be reduced to twelve thou&s;and. A warm di&s;pure en&s;uing, was managed in favour of the fir&s;t motion, by lord Hervey, Sir Robert Walpole and his brother, Mr. Pelham, Sir Philip Yorke attorney-general, who was counted a better lawyer than a politician, and &s;hone more as an advocate at the bar, than as an orator in the hou&s;e of commons. The la&s;t parti&s;an of the mini&s;try was Sir William Yonge, one of the lords commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea|&s;ury, a man who rendered him&s;elf &s;erviceable and nece&s;&s;ary by &s;tooping to all compliances, running upon every &s;cent, and haranging on every &s;ubject with an even, uninterrupted, tedious flow of dull declamation, compo&s;ed of a&s;&s;er|tions without veracity, conclu&s;ions from fal&s;e premi&s;es, words without mean|ing, and language without propriety. Lord Morpeth's motion was e&s;pou&s;ed by Mr. Watkin Williams Wynne, a gentleman of an ancient family and opulent fortune in Wales, brave, open, ho&s;pitable, and warmly attached to the antient con&s;titution and hierarchy: he was &s;upported by Mr. Walter Plumer, who &s;poke with weight, preci&s;ion, and &s;everity; by Sir W. Wyndham, Mr. Shippen, Mr. W. Pulteney, and Mr. Barnard. The courtiers argued, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to maintain &s;uch a number of land-forces as might de&s;eat the de&s;igns of malcontents, &s;ecure the interior tranquillity of the kingdom, de|fend it from external a&s;&s;aults, overawe its neighbours, and enable it to take vigorous mea&s;ures in ca&s;e the peace of Europe &s;hould be reimbro$led. They affirmed the &s;cience of war was &s;o much altered, and required &s;uch attention, that no dependence was to be placed upon a militia: that all nations were obliged to maintain &s;tanding armies, for their &s;ecurity again&s;t the encroach|ments of neighbouring powers: that the number of troops in Great-Britain was too incon&s;iderable to excite the jealou&s;y of the people, even under an am|bitious monarch: that his maje&s;ty never entertained the lea&s;t thought of in|fringing the liberties of his &s;ubjects: that it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed that the officers, among whom were many gentlemen of family and fortune, would ever concur in a de&s;ign to en&s;lave their country; and that the forces now in pay could not be properly deemed a &s;tanding army, ina&s;much as they were voted and maintained from year to year by the parliament, which was the repre&s;enta|tive of the people. To the&s;e arguments the members in the oppo&s;ition replied, that a &s;tanding force, in time of peace, was uncon&s;titutional, and had been always thought dangerous: that a militia was as capable of di&s;cipline as a &s;tanding army, and would have more incentives to courage and per&s;everance: that the civil magi&s;trate was able to pre&s;erve the peace of the country: and, that the number of the malcontents was altogether contemptible, though it might be con&s;iderably augmented by maintaining a &s;tanding army, and other &s;uch arbitrary mea&s;ures: that other nations had been en&s;laved by &s;tanding armies; and how|&s;oever they might find them&s;elves nece&s;&s;itated to depend upon a military force for &s;ecurity again&s;t incroaching neighbours, the ca&s;e was very different with regard to Great-Britain, for the defence of which nature had provided in a pe|culiar manner: that this provi&s;ion was &s;trengthened and improved by a nu|merous navy, that &s;ecured to her the dominion of the &s;ea; and if properly di&s;|po&s;ed, would render all inva&s;ion impracticable, or at lea&s;t ineffectual: that the land army of Great-Britain, though &s;ufficient to endanger the liberties of an unarmed people, could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ecure &s;uch an extent of coa&s;t, and there|fore could be of very little &s;ervice in preventing an inva&s;ion: that though
<PB N="542" REF="5450">
they had all imag$$able con&s;idence in his maje&s;ty's regard for the liberty of his &s;ubjects, they could not help apprehending, that &s;hould a &s;tanding army be|come part of the con&s;titution, another prince of more dangerous talents, and more fatal de&s;igns, might ari&s;s, and employ it for the wor&s;t purpo&s;es of am|bition: that though many officers were gentlemen of honour and probity, the&s;e might be ea&s;ily di&s;$arded, and the army gradually moulded into a quite different temper. By the&s;e means, practi&s;ed in former times, an army had been new-modelled to &s;uch a degree, that they turned their &s;words again&s;t the par|liament, for who&s;e defence they had been rai&s;ed, and de&s;troyed the con&s;titu|tion both in church and &s;tate: that with re&s;pect to its being wholly dependant on the parliament, the people of England would have rea&s;on to complain of the &s;ame hard&s;hip, whether a &s;tanding army &s;hould be declared at once indi&s;|pen&s;ible, or regularly voted from year to year, according to the direction of the mini&s;try: that the &s;anction of the legi&s;lature granted to mea&s;ures which in them&s;elves are uncon&s;titutional, burthen&s;ome, odious, and repugnant to the genius of the nation, in&s;tead of yielding con&s;olation, would &s;erve only to de|mon&s;trate, that the mo&s;t effectual method of forging the chains of national &s;lavery, would be that of mini&s;terial influence operating upon a venal parlia|ment. Such were the rea&s;ons urged again&s;t a &s;tanding army, of what num|ber &s;oever it might be compo&s;ed: but the expediency of reducing the number from about eighteen thou&s;and to twelve thou&s;and, was in&s;i&s;ted upon as the natural con&s;equence of his maje&s;ty's declaration, by which they were given to under&s;tand, that the peace of Europe was e&s;tabli&s;hed; and that he had nothing &s;o much at heart as the ea&s;e and pro&s;perity of his people. It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that if eighteen thou&s;and men were &s;ufficient, on the &s;uppo&s;ed eve of a general war in Europe, it was &s;urely rea&s;onable to think, that a le&s;s num|ber would &s;uffice when peace was perfectly re e&s;tabli&s;hed. Whatever effect the&s;e rea&s;ons had upon the body of the nation, they made no converts in the hou&s;e, where the majority re&s;olved that the &s;tanding army &s;hould be main|tained without reduction. Mr. Plumer complained, that the country was oppre&s;&s;ed by an arbitrary method of quartering &s;oldiers, in an undue propor|tion, upon tho&s;e publicans who refu&s;ed to vote in elections, according to the direction of the mini&s;try. Mr. Pult$ney a&s;&s;erted, that the money rai&s;ed for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of eighteen thou&s;and men in England, would maintain &s;ixty thou&s;and French or Germans, or the &s;ame number of almo&s;t any other people on the continent. Sir William Wyndham declared, that eighteen thou&s;and of the Engli&s;h troops in the late war, were maintained on le&s;s than two-thirds of the &s;um now demanded for the like number: but no regard was paid to the&s;e allegations.</P>

<P>The next object of importance that attracted the notice of the hou&s;e, was the &s;tate of the charitable corporation. This company was fir&s;t erected in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;even. Their profe&s;&s;ed intention was to lend money at legal intere&s;t, to the poor, upon &s;mall pledges; and to per&s;ons of better rank upon an indubitable &s;ecurity of goods im|pawned. Their capital was at fir&s;t limited to thirty thou&s;and pounds; but, by licences from the crown, they increa&s;ed it to &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, though their charter was never confirmed by act of parliament. In the month
<PB N="543" REF="5460">
of October, George Robin&s;on, e&s;q. member for Marlow, the ca&s;hier, and John Thomp&s;on, warehou&s;e-keeper of the corporation, di&s;appeared in one day. The proprietors, alarmed at this incident, held &s;everal general courts, and appointed a committee to in&s;pect the &s;tate of their affairs. They reported, that for a capital of above five hundred thou&s;and pounds, no equivalent was found; ina&s;much as their effects did not amount to to the value of thirty thou&s;and, the remainder having been embezzled by means which they could not di&s;cover. The proprietors, in a petition to the hou&s;e of commons, repre&s;ented, that by the mo&s;t notorious breach of tru&s;t, in &s;everal per&s;ons to whom the care and management of their af|fairs were committed, the corporation had been de&s;rauded of the greate&s;t part of their capital; and that many of the petitioners were reduced to the utmo&s;t degree of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s: they therefore prayed, that as they were unable to detect the combinations of tho&s;e who had ruined them, or to bring the delinquents to ju&s;tice, without the aid of the power and authority of parliament, the hou&s;e would vouch&s;afe to enquire into the &s;tate of the corporation, and the conduct of their managers; and give &s;uch relief to the petitioners, as to the hou&s;e &s;hould &s;eem meet. The petition was graciou&s;ly received, and a &s;ecret committee appointed to proceed on the enquiry. They &s;oon di&s;covered a mo&s;t iniquitous &s;cene of fraud, which had been acted by Robin&s;on and Thomp&s;on, in concert with &s;ome of the directors, for embezzling the capital, and cheating the pro|prietors. Many per&s;ons of rank and quality were concerned in this infamous con&s;piracy: &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters in the nation did not e&s;cape &s;u&s;picion and cen&s;ure. Sir Robert Sutton and Sir Archibald Grant were expelled the hou&s;e of commons, as having had a con&s;iderable &s;hare in tho&s;e fraudulent practices: and a bill was brought in to re&s;train them and other delinquents from leaving the kingdom, or alienating their effects. In the mean time, the committee received a letter from &s;ignior John Angelo Belloni, an eminent banker at Rome, giving them to under&s;tand, that Thomp&s;on was &s;ecured in that city, with all his papers, and confined to the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo; that the papers were tran&s;mitted to his corre&s;pondent at Paris, who &s;hould deliver them up, on certain conditions &s;tipulated in favour of the pri&s;oner. This letter was con&s;idered as an artifice to in&s;inuate a favourable opinion of the pretender, as if he had taken mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring Thomp&s;on, from his zeal for ju&s;tice, and affection to the Engli&s;h people. On this &s;uppo&s;ition, the propo&s;als were rejected with di&s;dain; and both hou&s;es concurred in an order, that the letter &s;hould be burned at the Royal Exchange, by the hands of the common hangman. The lower hou&s;e re&s;olved, that it was an in&s;olent and audacious libel, ab&s;urd and contradictory; that the whole tran&s;action a &s;canda|lous artifice, calculated to delude the unhappy, and to di&s;gui&s;e and conceal the wicked practices of the profe&s;&s;ed enemies to his maje&s;ty's per&s;on, crown, and dignity.</P>

<P>No motion, during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, produced &s;uch a warm con|te&s;t, as did that of Sir Robert Walpole, when, after a long preamble, he propo&s;ed that the duties upon &s;alt, which about two years before had been aboli&s;hed, &s;hould now be revived and granted to his maje&s;ty, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for the term of three years.

to one &s;hilling in the pound. All the members of the country party were immediately in commotion. They expre&s;&s;ed their &s;urprize at the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the impo&s;ition. They ob&s;erved, that two years had &s;carce elap&s;ed &s;ince the king, in a &s;peech from the throne, had exhorted them to aboli&s;h &s;ome of the taxes that were the mo&s;t burthen&s;ome to the poor: the hou&s;e was then of opi|nion, that the tax upon &s;alt was the mo&s;t burthen&s;ome, and the mo&s;t perni|cious to the trade of the kingdom, of all the impo&s;itions to which the poor were &s;ubjected, and therefore it was taken off: but that no good rea&s;on could be produced for altering their opinion &s;o &s;uddenly, and re&s;olving to grind the faces of the poor, in order to ea&s;e a few rich men of the landed intere&s;t. They affirmed, that the mo&s;t general taxes are not always the lea&s;t burthen&s;ome: that after a nation is obliged to extend their taxes farther than the luxuries of their country, tho&s;e taxes that can be rai&s;ed with the lea&s;t charge to the public, are the mo&s;t convenient and the ea&s;ie&s;t to the people: but they ought carefully to avoid taxing tho&s;e things which are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the poor. The price of all nece&s;&s;aries being thus enhanced, the wages of the trade&s;men and manufacturer mu&s;t be increa&s;ed; and, where the&s;e are high, the manu|factures will be under&s;old by tho&s;e of cheaper countries. The trade mu&s;t of con&s;equence be ruined; and it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the landed gentle|man would chu&s;e to &s;ave a &s;hilling in the pound from the land-tax, by means of an expedient that will ruin the manufactures of his country, and decrea&s;e the value of his own fortune. They alledged, that the &s;alt-tax particularly affected the poor, who could not afford to eat fre&s;h provi&s;ions; and that, as it formerly occa&s;ioned murmurs and di&s;contents among the lower cla&s;s of people, the revival of it would, in all probability, exa&s;perate them into open &s;edition. They ob&s;erved, that while it was exacted in England, a great number of mer|chants &s;ent their &s;hips to Ireland to be victualled for their re&s;pective voyages; that, &s;ince it had been aboli&s;hed, many experiments had been &s;ucce&s;sfully tried with &s;alt, for the improvement of agriculture, which would be entirely de|feated by the revival of this impo&s;ition. They &s;ugge&s;ted, that the land-tax was rai&s;ed at a very &s;mall expence, and &s;ubject to no fraud, whereas that upon &s;alt would employ a great number of additional officers in the revenue, wholly depending upon the mini&s;try, who&s;e influence in elections they would proportion|ably increa&s;e. They even hinted, that this con&s;ideration was one powerful motive for propo&s;ing the revival of an odious tax which was in effect an exci&s;e, and would be deemed a &s;tep towards a general exci&s;e upon all &s;orts of provi&s;ions. Finally, they demon&s;trated that the &s;alt-tax introduced numberle&s;s frauds and perjuries in different articles of traffic. Sir Robert Walpole endeavoured to obviate all the&s;e objections in a long &s;peech, which was minutely an&s;wered and refuted in every article by Mr. Pulteney. Neverthele&s;s, the que&s;tion being put, the mini&s;ter's motion was carried in the affirmative, and the duty revived: yet, before the bill pa&s;&s;ed, divers motions were made, and additional clau&s;es propo&s;ed by the members in the oppo&s;ition. New debates were rai&s;ed on every new objection, and the courtiers were obliged to di&s;pute their ground by inches.</P>

through the lower hou&s;e with great difficulty, but was lo&s;t among the peers: another for the better &s;ecuring the freedom of parliaments, by farther quali|fying members to &s;it in the hou&s;e of commons, was read the third time, and thrown out upon the que&s;tion. A committee had been appointed to enquire into a &s;ale of the e&s;tate which had belonged to the late earl of Derwentwater. It appeared by the report, that the &s;ale had been fraudulent: a bill was pre|pared to make it void: Dennis Bond, e&s;quire; and &s;erjeans Birch, commi&s;&s;ioners for the &s;ale of the for&s;eited e&s;tates, were declared guilty of notorious breach of tru&s;t, and expelled the hou&s;e, of which they were members; George Ro|bin&s;on, e&s;quire, underwent the &s;ame &s;entence, on account of the part he acted in the charitable corporation, as he and Thomp&s;on had neglected to &s;urrender them&s;elves according to the terms of a bill which had pa&s;&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion, five members of parliament were expelled for the mo&s;t &s;ordid acts of knavery: a &s;ure &s;ign of national degeneracy and di&s;honour. All the &s;upplies were granted, and, among other articles, the &s;um of two and twenty thou&s;and &s;ix hundred ninety four pounds &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ixpence, for the agio or difference of the &s;ub&s;idies payable to the crown of Denmark, in pur&s;uance of the treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the late king and that monarch; but, this was not obtained without a violent di&s;pute. Mr. Pulteney, who bore a con&s;iderable &s;hare in all the&s;e debates, became in a little time &s;o remarkable as to be thought worthy of a very particular mark of his maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure. The king, on the fir&s;t day of July, called for the council-book, and with his own hand &s;truck the name of William Pulteney, e&s;quire, out of the li&s;t of privy-coun&s;ellors: his maje&s;ty farther ordered him to be put out of all the commi&s;&s;ions of the peace. The &s;everal lords-lieutenant from whom he had received deputations, were commanded to revoke them; and the lord-chancellor and &s;ecretaries of &s;tate were directed to give the nece&s;|&s;ary orders for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>Nor did the hou&s;e of peers tamely and unanimou&s;ly &s;ubmit to the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try. The pen&s;ion-bill being read, was again rejected, and a prote&s;t entered. A debate aro&s;e about the number of &s;tanding forces: and the earl of Che&s;terfield argued for the court motion. The earl of Oxford moved, that they might be reduced to twelve thou&s;and effective men. The earl of Win|chel&s;ea ob&s;erved, that a &s;tanding army rendered mini&s;ters of &s;tate more daring than otherwi&s;e they would be, in contriving and executing projects that were grievous to the people: &s;chemes that never could enter into the heads of any but tho&s;e who were drunk with exce&s;s of power. The marquis of Twee dale, in rea&s;oning again&s;t &s;uch a number as the mini&s;try propo&s;ed, took occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that not one &s;hilling of the forfeited citates was ever applied to the u&s;e of the public: he likewi&s;e took notice, that the eighteen thou&s;and men de|manded as a &s;tanding force, were modelled in &s;uch a manner, that they might be &s;peedily augmented to forty thou&s;and men on any emergency. The duke of Argyle endeavoured to demon&s;trate the danger of depending for the &s;afety of the kingdom upon an undi&s;ciplined militia, a fleet, or an army of auxiliaries. Then he repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to a regular army in ca&s;e of inva&s;ion; and after all acknowledged, that the number propo&s;ed was no way &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e.

<P>THE mo&s;t remarkable incident that di&s;tingui&s;hed this year in Eng|land was a very uncommon in&s;tance of &s;uicide; an act of de&s;pair &s;o frequent among the Engli&s;h, that in other countries it is objected to them as a national reproach. Though it may be generally termed the effect of lunacy proceeding from natural cau&s;es operating on the human body, in &s;ome few in|&s;tances it &s;eems to have been the re&s;ult of cool deliberation. Richard Smith, a bookbinder, and pri&s;oner for debt within the liberties of the king's-bench, per&s;uaded his wife to follow his example, in making away with her&s;elf, after they had murdered their little infant. This wretched pair was in the month of April found hanging in their bedchamber at about a yard's di&s;tance from
<PB N="548" REF="5510">
each other; and in a &s;eparate apartment the child lay dead in a cradle. They left two papers inclo&s;ed in a &s;hort letter to their landlord, who&s;e kindne&s;s they implored in favour of their dog and cat. They even left money to pay the porter who &s;hould carry the inclo&s;ed papers to the per&s;on for whom they were addre&s;&s;ed. In one of the&s;e the hu&s;band thanked that per&s;on for the marks of friend&s;hip he had received at his hands; and complained of the ill offices he had undergone from a different quarter. The other paper, &s;ub&s;cribed by the hu&s;|band and wife, contained the rea&s;ons which induced them to act &s;uch a tragedy on them&s;elves and their offspring. This letter was altogether &s;urpri&s;ing for the calm re&s;olution, the good humour, and the propriety with which it was written. They declared, that they withdrew them&s;elves from poverty and rags; evils, that through a train of unlucky accidents, were become inevitable. They appeal|ed to their neighbours for the indu&s;try with which they had endeavoured to earn a livelihood. They ju&s;tified the murder of their child, by &s;aying, it was le&s;s cruelty to take her with them, than to leave her friendle&s;s in the world, expo&s;ed to igno|rance and mi&s;ery. They profe&s;&s;ed their belief and confidence in an Almighty God, the fountain of goodne&s;s and beneficence, who could not po&s;&s;ibly take delight in the mi&s;ery of his creatures: they therefore re&s;igned up their lives to him without any terrible apprehen&s;ions; &s;ubmitting them&s;elves to tho&s;e ways which, in his goodne&s;s, he &s;hould appoint after death. Tho&s;e unfortunate &s;uicides had been always indu&s;trious and frugal, invincibly hone&s;t, and re|markable for conjugal affection.</P>

<P>Tru&s;tees having been appointed by charter to &s;uperintend a new &s;ettle|ment in Georgia, &s;ituated to the &s;outhward of Carolina in America, Mr. Ogle|thorpe, as general and governor of the province embarked at Grave&s;end, with a number of poor families to plant that colony. The king of Spain having equipped a very powerful armament, the $leet &s;ailed on the fourth day of June from the road of Alicant, under the command of the count de Montemar, and arrived on the coa&s;t of Barbary in the neighbourhood of Oran, where a con&s;i|derable body of troops was landed without much oppo&s;ition. Next day, however, they were attacked by a numerous army of Moors, over whom they obtained a complete victory. The bey or governor of Oran, immediately retired with his garri&s;on, and the Spaniards took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, from which they had been driven in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eight. The &s;trong fort of Mazalaquivir was likewi&s;e &s;urrendered to the victors at the fir&s;t &s;um|mons; &s;o that this expedition an&s;wered all the views with which it had been projected. Victor Amadaeu$, the abdicated king of Sardinia, having, at the in&s;tigation of his wife, engaged in &s;ome intrigues, in order to rea&s;cend the throne, his &s;on, the reigning king, ordered his per&s;on to be &s;eized at Montcalier, and conveyed to Rivoli, un$$r a &s;trong e&s;corte. His wife, the marchione&s;s de sp$gno, was conducted to C$va. The old king's confe&s;&s;or, his phy&s;ician, and eight and forty per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, were impri&s;oned. The citadel of Turin was &s;ecured with a &s;trong garri&s;on: and new in&s;tructions were given to the go|vernor and &s;enate of Chambern. The di&s;pute which had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between $word$ king of Pru&s;&s;ia and the young prince of Orange, touching the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to $span$ po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by king W$$l$am III. as head of the hou&s;e of Orange, was $t la&s;t accommodated by a formal treaty &s;igned at Berlin and Dieren. The Dutch were greatly a armed about this time with an apprehen&s;ion of being over|whelmed
<PB N="549" REF="5520">
by an inundation, occa&s;ioned by worms, which were &s;aid to have con|&s;umed the piles and timber-work that &s;upported their dykes. They prayed and fa&s;ted with uncommon zeal, in terror of this calamity, which they did not know how to avert in any other manner. At length, they were delivered from their fears by a hard fro&s;t, which effectually de&s;troyed tho&s;e dangerous animals. About this time, Mr. Dieden, plenipotentiary from the elector of Hanover, re|ceived, in the name of his ma&s;ter, the inve&s;titure of Bremen and Verden from the hands of the emperor.</P>

<P>The hi&s;tory of England at this period cannot be very intere&s;ting, as it chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in an annual revolution of debates in parliament. Debates, in which the &s;ame arguments perpetually recur on the &s;ame &s;ubjects. When the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened on the &s;ixteenth day of January, the king declared, that the &s;ituation of affairs both at home and abroad rendered it unnece&s;&s;ary for him to lay before the two hou&s;es any other rea&s;ons for calling them together, but the or|dinary di&s;patch of the public bu&s;ine&s;s, and his de&s;ire of receiving their advice in &s;uch affairs as &s;hould require the care and con&s;ideration of parliament. The motion made in the hou&s;e of commons for an addre&s;s of thanks, implied, that they &s;hould expre&s;s their &s;atisfaction at the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs both at home and abroad. The motion was carried, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of tho&s;e who ob&s;erved, that the nation had very little rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with the pre|&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs: that the French were employed in fortifying and re&s;toring the harbour of Dunkirk, contrary to the faith of the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties: that the Briti&s;h merchants had received no redre&s;s for the depredations committed by the Spaniards: that the commerce of England daily decrea&s;ed: that no &s;ort of trade throve but the traffic of Change-alley, where the mo&s;t abominable frauds were practi&s;ed: and, that every &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament opened a new &s;cene of villany and impo&s;ition.</P>

<P>The pen&s;ion-bill was once more revived, and lo&s;t again in the hou&s;e of peers. All the rea&s;ons formerly advanced again&s;t a &s;tanding army were now repeated; and a reduction of the number in&s;i&s;ted upon with &s;uch warmth, that the mini&s;terial party were obliged to have recour&s;e to the old phantom of the pretender. Sir Archer Croft &s;aid, a continuation of the &s;ame number of forces was the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, to his knowledge, popery was increa&s;ing very fa&s;t in the country; for, in one pari&s;h which he knew, there were &s;even popi&s;h prie&s;ts: and, that the danger from the pretender was the more to be feared$ becau&s;e they did not know but he was then breeding his &s;on a prote&s;tant. Sir Ro|bert Walpole ob&s;erved, that a reduction of the army was the chief thing wi&s;hed for, and de&s;ired by all the Jacobites in the kingdom: that no reduction had ever been made but what gave fre&s;h hopes to that party, and encouraged them to rai&s;e tumults again&s;t the government; and, he did not doubt, but that if they &s;hould re&s;olve to reduce any part of the army, there would be po&s;t-hor&s;es em|ployed that very night to carry the good news beyond &s;ea to the pretender. His brother Horatio added, that the number of troops then propo&s;ed was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport his maje&s;ty's government, and would be nece&s;&s;ary as long as the nation enjoyed the happine&s;s of having the pre&s;ent illu&s;trious family on the throne. The futility, the &s;elf-contradiction, and the ridiculous ab&s;urdity of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, were properly expo&s;ed; neverthele&s;s, the army was voted without any reduction. Sir Wilfred Law&s;on having made a motion for an ad|dre&s;s
<PB N="550" REF="5530">
to the king, to know what &s;atisfaction had been made by Spain for the depredations committed on the Briti&s;h merchants; it was after a violent debate approved$ and the addre&s;s pre&s;ented. The king, in an&s;wer to this remon&s;trance, gave them to under&s;tand, that the meeting of the commi&s;&s;aries of the two crowns had been &s;o long delayed by unfore&s;een accidents, that the conferences were not opened $ill the latter end of the preceding February; and, that as the courts of London and Madrid had agreed, that the term of three years &s;tipulated for fin$$$ing the commi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be computed from their fir&s;t meeting, a perfect account of their proceedings could not as yet be layed before the hou&s;$ of commons. A bill had been long depending for granting encouragement to the &s;ugar colonies in the We&s;t-Indies; but, as it was founded upon a prohibition that would have put a &s;top to all commerce between the French i&s;lands and the Briti&s;h &s;$ttlements in North America, it met with a very warm oppo&s;ition from tho&s;e who had the pro&s;perity of tho&s;e northern colonies at heart. But the bill being patronized and &s;upported by the court intere&s;t, &s;urmounted all objections; and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed into a law. While the commons deliberated upon the &s;upply, Sir Robert Walpole moved, that five hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued out of the &s;inking fund for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year. Sir Wil|liam Wyndham, Mr. Pulteney, and Sir John Barnard, expatiated upon the iniquity of pillaging a &s;acred depo&s;it, &s;olemnly appropriated to the di&s;charge of the national debt; and they might have demon$$rated the egregious folly of a mea&s;ure, by which the public, for a little temporary ea&s;e, lo&s;t the advantage of the accumulating intere$t which would have ari$en from the &s;inking fund it pro$erly managed and re&s;erved. All objections vani&s;hed before the powers of mini&s;terial influence, which nothing now could check but the immediate dan|ger of popular commotion. Such hazardous interpo&s;ition actually defeated a &s;cheme which had been adopted by the mini&s;ter; and even before its appearance alarmed all the trading part of the nation.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e having re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee, to deliberate upon the mo&s;t proper methods for the better &s;ecurity and improvement of the duties and revenues charged upon tobacco and wines, all the papers relating to the&s;e duties were &s;ubmitted to the peru&s;al of the members; the commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms and exci&s;e were ordered to attend the hou&s;e, the avenues of which were crowded with multitudes of people; and the members in the oppo&s;ition waited impatiently for a propo&s;al, in which they thought the liberties of their country &s;o $eeply intere&s;ted. In a word, there had been a call of the hou&s;e on the pre|ceding day. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was frequent and full; and both &s;ides appeared ready and eager for the conte&s;t, when Sir Robert Walpole broached his de&s;ign. He $ook notice of the arts which had been u&s;ed to prejudice the people again&s;t his plan before it was known. He affirmed, that the clamours occa&s;ioned by the&s;e prejudices had originally ri&s;en from &s;mugglers and fraudulent dealers, who had enriched them&s;elves by cheating the public; and, that the&s;e had been &s;trenu|ou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted and &s;upported by another &s;et of men, fond of every opportunity to &s;tir up the people of Great-Britain to mutiny and &s;edition. He expatiated on the frauds that were committed in that branch of the revenue ari&s;ing from the duties on tobacco; upon the hard&s;hips to which the American plant|ers were &s;ubjected by the heavy duties payable on importation, as well as by the ill u&s;age they had met with from their factors and corre&s;pondents in
<PB N="551" REF="5540">
England, who, from being their &s;ervants, were now become their ma&s;ters$ upon the injury done to the fair trader; and the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the public with re&s;pect to the revenue. He a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;cheme he was about to pro|po&s;e would remove all the&s;e inconveniencies, prevent numberle&s;s frauds, perju|ries, and fal&s;e entries, and add two or three hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum to the public revenue. He entered into a long detail of frauds practi&s;ed by the knavi&s;h dealer in tho&s;e commodities: he recited the &s;everal acts of par|liament that related to the duties on wine and tobacco. He declared he had no intention to promote a general exci&s;e: he endeavoured to obviate &s;ome ob|jections that might be made to his plan, the nature of which he at length ex|plained. He propo&s;ed to join the laws of exci&s;e to tho&s;e of the cu&s;toms: that the farther &s;ub&s;idy of three farthings per pound charged upon imported to|bacco, &s;hould be &s;till levied at the cu&s;tom hou&s;e, and payable to his maj$&s;ty's civil-li&s;t, as heretofore: that then the tobacco &s;hould be lodged in wareho$&s;$s, to be appointed for that purpo&s;e by the commi&s;&s;ioner of the exci&s;e: that the keeper of each warehou&s;e, appointed likewi&s;e by the commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;hould h$ve one$lock and key, and the merchant-importer have another: and, that the to|bacco &s;hould be thus &s;ecured until the merchant &s;hould find vent for it$ either by exportation or home con&s;umption: that the part de&s;igned for exportation &s;hould be weighed at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, di&s;charged of the three farthings per pound which had been payed at its fir&s;t importation; and then exported with|out further trouble: that the portion de&s;tined for home-con&s;umption &s;hould, in pre&s;ence of the warehou&s;e-keeper, be delivered to the purcha&s;er, upon his paying the inland duty of fourpence per pound weight to the proper o$$cer appointed to receive it; by which means the merchant would be ea&s;ed of the inconveni|ence of paying the duty upon importation, or of granting bonds and finding &s;ureties for the payment, before he had found a market for the commodity: that all penalties and forfeitures, &s;o far as they formerly belonged to the crown, &s;hould for the future be applied to the u&s;e of the public: that appeals in this, as well as in all other ca&s;es relating to the exci&s;e, &s;hould be heard and determined by two or three of the judges to be named by his maje&s;ty, and in the country, by the judge of a$$ize upon the next circuit, who &s;hould hear and determine &s;uch appeals in the mo&s;t &s;ummary manner, without the formality of proceed|ings in courts of law or equity.</P>

<P>Such was the &s;ub&s;tance of the famous exci&s;e-&s;cheme, in favour of which Sir Robert Walpole moved, that the duties and &s;ub&s;idies on tobacco, &s;hould from and after the twenty-fourth day of June cea&s;e and determine. The debate which en&s;ued was managed and maintained by all the able &s;peakers on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. Sir Robert Walpole was an&s;wered by Mr. Perry, member for the city of London. Sir Paul Methuen joined in the oppo&s;ition. Sir John Barnard, another repre&s;entative of London, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the &s;ame cau&s;e. He was &s;upported by Mr. Pult$n$y, Sir William Wyndham, and other patriots. The &s;cheme was e&s;pou&s;ed by Sir Philip Yorke, appointed lord chief-ju&s;tice of the king's bench, and ennobled in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing year. Sir Joseph Jekyl approved of the project, which was likewi&s;e &s;trenuou&s;ly defended b$ lord Hervey, Sir Thomas Ro$$n&s;on, Sir William Yo$$e, Mr. Pelham, and Mr. Winnington, which la&s;t excelled all $is co$emporan$s of the m$ni&s;try in talents and addre&s;s. Tho&s;$ who argued aga$$$t the $word$ accu&s;ed
<PB N="452" REF="5550">
the mini&s;ter of having mi&s;repre&s;ented the frauds, and made fal&s;e calculations. With re&s;pect to the &s;uppo&s;ed hard&s;hips under which the planters were &s;aid to labour, they affirmed, that no planter had ever dreamed of complaining, until in&s;tigated by letters and applications from London: that this &s;cheme, far from relieving the planters, would expo&s;e the factors to &s;uch grievous oppre&s;&s;ion, that they would not be able to continue the trade, con&s;equently the planters would be intirely ruined; and after all, it would not prevent tho&s;e frauds again&s;t which it was &s;aid tobe provided: that from the examination of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms, it appeared that tho&s;e frauds did not exceed forty thou&s;and pounds per annum, and might in a great mea&s;ure be aboli&s;hed by a due execu|tion of the laws in being; con&s;equently this &s;cheme was unnece&s;&s;ary, would be ineffectual in augmenting the revenue, de&s;tructive to trade, and dangerous to the liberties of the &s;ubject, as it tended to promote a general exci&s;e, which was in all countries con&s;idered as a grievous oppre&s;&s;ion. They &s;ugge&s;ted, that it would produce an additional &s;warm of exci&s;e-officers and warehou&s;e-keepers, appointed and payed by the trea&s;ury, &s;o as to multiply the dependents on the crown, and enable it &s;till farther to influence the freedom of elections: that the traders would become &s;laves to exci&s;e-men and warehou&s;e-keepers, as they would be debarred all acce&s;s to their commodities, except at certain hours, when attended by tho&s;e officers: that the merchant, for every quantity of tobacco he could &s;ell, would be obliged to make a journey, or &s;end a me&s;&s;enger to the office for a permit, which could not be obtained without trouble, expence, and delay: and, that &s;hould a law be enacted in con&s;equence of this motion, it would in all probability be &s;ome time or other u&s;ed as a precedent for introducing exci&s;e laws into every branch of the revenue; in which ca&s;e the liberty of Great-Britain would be no more. In the cour&s;e of this debate, Sir Robert Walpole took notice of the multitudes which had be&s;et all the approaches to the hou&s;e. He &s;aid, it would be an ea&s;y ta&s;k for a de&s;igning &s;editious per&s;on to rai&s;e a tumult and di&s;order among them: that gentlemen might give them what name they &s;hould think fit, and affirm they were come as humble &s;uppli|ants; but, he knew whom the law called &s;turdy beggars: and tho&s;e who brought them to that place, could not be certain but that they might behave in the &s;ame manner. This in&s;inuation was re&s;ented by Sir John Barnard, who ob|&s;erved, that merchants of character had a right to come down to the court of reque&s;ts, and lobby of the hou&s;e of commons, in order to &s;ollicit their friends and acquaintance again&s;t any &s;cheme or project which they might think preju|dicial to their commerce: that when he came into the hou&s;e, he &s;aw none but &s;uch as de&s;erved the appellation of &s;turdy beggars as little as the honourable<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$33.</NOTE> gentleman him&s;elf, or any gentleman whatever. After a warm di&s;pute the mo|tion was carried by a majority of &s;ixty-one voices. Several re&s;olutions were founded on the propo&s;al; and to the&s;e the hou&s;e agreed, though not without another violent conte&s;t. The re&s;olutions produced a bill, again&s;t which peti|tions were preferred by the lord-mayor, aldermen, and common-council of Lon|don, the cities of Coventry and Nottingham. A motion was made that coun&s;el &s;hould be heard for the city of London; but it was rejected by the majority, and the petitions were ordered to lie upon the table. Had the mini&s;ter en|countered no oppo&s;ition but that which appeared within doors, his project would have certainly been carried into execution; but the whole nation was alarmed, and
<PB N="553" REF="5560">
clamoured loudly again&s;t the exci&s;e-bill. The populace &s;till crowded around We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, blocking up all the avenues to the hou&s;e of commons. They even in&s;ulted the per&s;ons of tho&s;e members who had voted for the mini&s;try on this occa&s;ion; and Sir Robert Walpole began to be in fear of his life. He therefore thought proper to drop the de&s;ign, by moving, that the &s;econd reading of the bill might be po&s;tponed till the twelfth day of June. Then complaint being made of the in&s;olence of the populace, who had maltreated &s;everal mem|bers, divers re&s;olutions were taken again&s;t tho&s;e tumultuous crowds and their abettors; and the&s;e re&s;olves were communicated to the lord-mayor of London, the &s;heriff of Middle&s;ex, and the high-bailiff of We&s;tmin&s;ter. Some individuals were apprehended in the court of reque&s;ts, as having fomented the di&s;turbances; but they were &s;oon relea&s;ed. The mi&s;carriage of the bill was celebrated with public rejoicings in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter; and the mini&s;ter was burned in effigie by the populace. After the mi&s;carriage of the exci&s;e-&s;cheme, the hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to inquire into the frauds and abu&s;es in the cu&s;toms; and a committee of twenty-one per&s;ons was cho&s;en by ballot for this purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>The &s;ub&s;equent debates of this &s;e&s;&s;ion were occa&s;ioned by a bill to prevent the infamous practice of &s;tockjobbing, which with great difficulty made its way to the hou&s;e of lords, who made &s;ome amendments, in con&s;e|quence of which it was layed a&s;ide; and, by another bill e&s;tabli&s;hing a lot|tery, to rai&s;e five hundred thou&s;and pounds for the relief of tho&s;e who had &s;uffered by the charitable corporation. After having undergone &s;ome altera|tions, it pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, and obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent. The king, by a me&s;&s;age to parliament, had &s;ignified his intention to give the prince&s;s-royal in marriage to the prince of Orange, promi&s;ing him&s;elf their concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he might be enabled to be&s;tow &s;uch a portion with his elde&s;t daughter, as &s;hould be &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion. The commons immediately re&s;olved, that out of the monies ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of lands in the i&s;land of St. Chri&s;topher's, his maje&s;ty &s;hould be empowered to apply four&s;core thou|&s;and pounds as a marriage-dower for his daughter; and a clau&s;e for this pur|po&s;e was in&s;erted in the bill, for enabling his maje&s;ty to apply five hundred thou&s;and pounds out of the &s;inking-fund for the &s;ervice of the current year.</P>

<P>The oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of lords was &s;till more animated, though ineffectual. The debates chiefly turned upon the pen&s;ion-bill, and the num|ber of land-forces, on a motion made by lord Bathur&s;t, for an account of the produce of the forfeited e&s;tates, which had belonged to the directors of the South-&s;ea company. The tru&s;tees for the&s;e e&s;tates had charged them&s;elves with a great &s;um of money; and the lords in the oppo&s;ition thought they had a right to know how it had been di&s;po&s;ed. The mini&s;try had rea&s;ons to &s;tifle this inquiry; and therefore oppo&s;ed it with all their vigour. Neverthele&s;s, the motion was carried, after a warm di&s;pute, and the directors of the South-&s;ea company were ordered to lay the account before the hou&s;e. From this it appeared, that the large &s;ums of money ari&s;ing from the forfeited e&s;tates, had been di&s;tributed among the proprietors by way of dividend, even before re|cour&s;e was had to parliament for directions in what manner that produce &s;hould be applied: lord Bathur&s;t therefore moved for a re&s;olution of the hou&s;e, that the di&s;po&s;al of this money by way of dividend, without any order or direction of a general court for that purpo&s;e, was a violation of the act of parliament
<PB N="554" REF="5570">
made for the di&s;po&s;al thereof, and a manife&s;t in$u&s;tice done to the proprietors of that &s;tock. The d$ke of N$w$a&s;tle, in order to gain time, moved, that as the account was confu&s;ed and almo&s;t $word$ the pre&s;ent directors of the company might be ordered to lay before the hou&s;e a further and more $word$ $word$ of the manner in which the money had been di&s;po&s;ed. A violent conte&s;t $$&s;$ed, in the cour&s;e of which the hou&s;e divided, and of fifty-&s;even peers who $$ted for the delay, forty-&s;ix were &s;uch as enjoyed pre|ferment in the church$ commi&s;&s;ions in the army, or civil employments under the government. At length lord Bathur&s;t waved his motion for that time: then the hou&s;e ordered, that the pre&s;ent and former directors of the South-&s;ea company, together with the late in&s;pectors of their accounts, &s;hould attend and be examined. They were accordingly interrogated, and gave &s;o little &s;a|ti&s;faction, that lord Bathur&s;t moved for a committee of inquiry; but the que&s;tion being put$ was carried in the negative: yet a very &s;trong prote&s;t was entered by the lords in the oppo&s;ition. The next &s;ubject of altercation was the bill for mi&s;applying part of the produce of the &s;inking-fund. It was at|tacked with all the force of argument, wit, and declamation, by the earl of Strafford, the lords Bathur&s;t and Carteret, and the earl of Che&s;terfield, who had by this time re&s;igned his &s;taff of lord-&s;teward of the hou&s;hold, and re|nounced all connection with the mini&s;try. Lord Bathur&s;t moved for a re&s;o|lution, importing, that, in the opinion of the hou&s;e, the &s;inking-fund ought for the future to be applied, in time of peace and public tranquillity, to the redemp|tion of tho&s;e taxes which were mo&s;t prejudicial to the trade, mo&s;t burthen&s;ome on the manufacture, and mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive on the poor of the nation. This mo|tion was over-ruled, and the bill adopted by the majority. On the eleventh day of June, the king gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to the bills that were prepared, and clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, in which he took notice of the wicked endeavours that had been lately u&s;ed to inflame the minds of the people, by the mo&s;t unju&s;t mi&s;repre&s;entations.</P>

<P>Europe was now reinvolved in fre&s;h troubles, by a vacancy on the throne of Poland. Augu&s;t$$ died at War&s;aw in the end of January, and the neighbouring powers were immediately in commotion. The elector of Saxony &s;on to the late king, and Stan$&s;laus who&s;e daughter was married to the French monarch, declared them&s;elves candidates for the Poli&s;h throne. The emperor, the czarina, and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;ts of the Saxon; the king of France &s;upported the preten&s;ions of his father-in-law. The foreign mini&s;ters at War&s;aw forthwith began to form intrigues among the electors; and the marquis de Monti, amba&s;&s;ador from France, exerted him&s;elf &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully, that he &s;oon gained over the p$imate, and a majority of the catholic $word$ to the intere&s;ts of Stan$$laus; wh$$e the Imperial and Ru&s;&s;ian troops hovered on the frontiers of Poland. The French king no &s;ooner under&s;tood that a body of the emperor's forces was encamped in S$$$&s;ia, than he ordered the duke of Berwick to a&s;&s;emble an army on the Rhine, and take mea&s;ures for entering Germany, in ca&s;e the Imperia$$$ts &s;hould march into Poland. A French $eet &s;et &s;ail for Dantzick, while Stan$$laus trave$led through Ger|many in d$$gu$$e to Poland, and concealed h m&s;$$f in the hou&s;e of the French amba&s;&s;ador at War&s;aw.

of prote&s;t again&s;t the contingent election of Stani&s;laus, as a per&s;on pro&s;cribed, di&s;qualified, depending upon a foreign power, and connected with the Turks and other infidels. The Ru&s;&s;ian general La&s;ci entered Poland at the head of fifty thou&s;and men: the diet of the election was opened with the u&s;ual cere|mony on the twenty-fifth day of Augu&s;t: prince Vie&s;azowi&s;ki chief of the Saxon intere&s;t, retired to the other &s;ide of the Vi&s;tula, with three thou&s;and men, including &s;ome of the nobility who adhered to that party. Neverthe|le&s;s, the primate proceeded to the election: Stani&s;laus was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en king; and appeared in the electoral field, where he was received with loud acclamation. The oppo&s;ite party &s;oon increa&s;ed to ten thou&s;and men; pro|te&s;ted again&s;t the election, and joined the Ru&s;&s;ian army, which advanced by &s;peedy marches. King Stani&s;laus finding him&s;elf unable to cope with &s;uch ad|ver&s;aries, retired with the primate and French amba&s;&s;ador to Dantzick, leav|ing the palatine of Kiow at War&s;aw. This general attacked the Saxon palace, which was &s;urrendered upon terms: then the &s;oldiers and inhabitants plundered the hou&s;es belonging to the grandees who had declared for Augu&s;tus, as well as the hotel of the Ru&s;&s;ian mini&s;ter. In the mean time, the Poles who had joined the Mu&s;covites, finding it impracticable to pa&s;s the Vi&s;tula before the expiration of the time fixed for the &s;e&s;&s;ion of the diet, erected a kolo at Gro|cow, where the elector of Saxony was cho&s;en and proclaimed by the bi&s;hop of Cracow, king of Poland, under the name of Augu&s;tus III. on the &s;ixth day of October. They afterwards pa&s;&s;ed the river, and the palatine of Kiow re|tiring towards Cracow, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of War&s;aw, where in their turn they plundered the palaces and hou&s;es belonging to the oppo&s;ite party.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the French king concluded a treaty with Spain and Sardinia, by which the&s;e powers agreed to declare war again&s;t the emperor. Manife&s;tos were publi&s;hed reciprocally by all the contracting powers. The duke of Berwick pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in October, and undertook the &s;iege of &s;ort Kehl, which in a few days was &s;urrendered on capitulation: then he repa&s;&s;ed the river, and returned to Ver&s;ailles. The king of Sardinia having declared war again&s;t the emperor, joined a body of French forces commanded by marechal de Villars, and drove the Imperiali&s;ts out of the Milane&s;e. His Imperial maje&s;ty dreading the effects of &s;uch a powerful confederacy again&s;t him, offered to compromi&s;e all differences with the crown of Spain, under the mediation of the king of Great-Britain; and Mr. Keene, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter at Madrid, propo&s;ed an accommodation. Philip expre&s;&s;ed his acknowledgments to the king of England, declaring, however, that the emperor's advances were too late; and that his own re&s;olutions were already taken. Neverthele&s;s, he &s;ent orders to the count de Montijo, his amba&s;&s;ador at London, to commu|nicate to his Britannic maje&s;ty the motives which had induced him to take the&s;e re&s;olutions. In the mean time, he detached a powerful armament to Italy, where they inve&s;ted the Imperial fortre&s;s of Aula, the garri&s;on of which was obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. The republic of Venice declared &s;he would take no &s;hare in the di&s;putes of Italy: the &s;tates-general &s;igned a neutrality with the French king, for the Au&s;trian Netherlands, without con&s;ulting the emperor or the king of Great-Britain; and the Engli&s;h councils &s;eemed to be altogether pacific.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e of commons re&s;olved to addre&s;s his maje&s;ty for a copy of the treaty of Vienna. Sir John Ru&s;hout moved for another, de&s;iring that $$e letters and in&s;tructions relating to the execution of the treaty of Seville &s;hould be &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection of the commons; but, after a hard $$$$gg$e, it was over-ruled. The next motion was made by Mr. Sandys, a gent$em$n who had for &s;ome time appeared &s;trenuous in the oppo&s;ition, and $rang$ed with great per&s;everance. He propo&s;ed, that the hou&s;e &s;hould examine the in&s;tructions which had been given to the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter in Poland, &s;ome y$ars before the death of king Augu&s;tus, that they might be the better able to judge of the cau&s;es which produced this new rupture among the powers of Europe.

Sir John Bar|nard pre&s;ented a petition from the druggi&s;ts, and other dealers in tea, com|plaining of the in&s;ults and oppre&s;&s;ion to which they were &s;ubjected by the exci&s;e laws, and imploring relief. Sir John and Mr. Perry, another of the city|members, explained the grievous hard&s;hips which tho&s;e traders &s;u&s;tained, and moved that the petition might be referred to the con&s;ideration of the whole hou&s;e. They were oppo&s;ed by Mr. Winnington, Sir W. Yonge, and other parti&s;ans of the mini&s;try; and the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes brought on a general engage|ment of the two parties, in which every weapon of &s;atire, argument, rea&s;on, and truth, was weilded again&s;t that odious, arbitrary, and oppre&s;&s;ive method of collecting the public revenue. Neverthele&s;s, the motion in favour of the &s;ufferers was rejected.</P>

<P>When the commons deliberated upon the &s;upply, Mr. Andrews, deputy-payma&s;ter of the army, moved for an addition of eighteen hundred men to the number of land forces which had been continued &s;ince the preceding year. The members in the oppo&s;ition di&s;puted this &s;mall augmentation with too much heat and eagerne&s;s. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, they were by this time irritated into &s;uch per&s;onal animo&s;ity again&s;t the mini&s;ter, that they re|&s;olved to oppo&s;e all his mea&s;ures, whether they might or might not be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety and advantage of the kingdom. Nor indeed were they altogether blameable for acting on this maxim, if their &s;ole aim was to re|move from the confidence and coun&s;els of their &s;overeign, a man who&s;e con|duct they thought prejudicial to the intere&s;t and liberties of their country. They could not, however, prevent the augmentation propo&s;ed: but they re&s;olved, if they could not wholly &s;top the career of the mini&s;try, to throw in &s;uch a number of rubs as &s;hould at lea&s;t retard their progre&s;s. The duke of Bolton and lord Cobham had been deprived of the regiments they commanded, be|cau&s;e they refu&s;ed to concur in every project of the admini&s;tration. It was in con&s;equence of their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion that lord Morpeth moved for a bill to prevent any commi&s;&s;ion$officer, not above the rank of a colonel, from being removed, unle&s;s by a court-martial, or by addre&s;s of either hou&s;e of parliament. Such
<PB N="558" REF="5610">
an attack on the prerog$tive might have &s;ucceeded in the latter part of the reign of the fir&s;t Charles; but at this juncture could not fall to mi&s;carry: yet it was $word$ with great vigo$r and addre$s. When the propo&s;al was &s;et a&s;ide by the majority. Mr. Sandys moved for an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring to know who advi&s;ed his maje&s;ty to remove the duke of B$$ton and lord Cobnam from their re&s;pective reg$ments. He was &s;$$ond$d by Mr. Pulteney and Sir William Wyndham: but the mini&s;try fore$$eing another tec$$us di&s;pute, called for the que&s;tion, and the m$tion was carried in the negative. The next &s;ource of contention was a bill for &s;ecuring the freedom of parliament, by limiting the number of officers in the hou&s;e of $ $word$ It was read a fir&s;t and &s;econd time; but, wh$$ a motion was made for its being committed, it met with a powerful oppo&s;ition, and produced a warm debate that i&s;&s;ued in a que&s;tion which$ like the f$rmer$ pa&s;&s;ed in the nega$ive. A clergyman having in&s;inuated in c$nver&s;at$on that Sir William M$lner, baronet, member for York, received a pen&s;ion from the mini&s;$ry$ the hou&s;e took cognizance of this report: the clergyman acknowledged at the bar that he mignt have dropped &s;uch a hint from hear&s;ay. The a$$$&s;ed member prote&s;ted upon his honour, that he never did, or ever would receive, place, pen&s;ion, gratuity, or reward, from the court, either directly or indirectly$ for voting in parliament, or upon any other account whatever. The accu&s;ation was vote $word$ and &s;candalous, and the accu&s;er taken into cu&s;tody; but in a few days he was di&s;charged upon his humble petition, and begging pardon of the $word$ whom he had calumni|ated. The duty upon &s;a$t was pro$onged for eight years; and a bill pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t &s;tock-job$ing.</P>

<P>But the &s;ubject which of all others employed the eloquence and abilities on both &s;ides to the $word$ vigor us ex$rtion, was a motion made by Mr. Bromley, who propo&s;ed that a bill &s;hould be brought in for repealing the &s;eptennia$ act, and for the more frequent meeting and calling of parlia|ments. The arguments for and again&s;t &s;ept$nnial parliaments have already been &s;tated. The mini&s;try no$ in&s;i&s;ted upon the increa&s;e of papi&s;ts and ja|cobites, which rendered it dangerous to weake$ the hands of the government: they challenged the oppo&s;ition to produce one in&s;tance in which the lea&s;t in|cr$achment had been made on the liberties of the people, &s;i$ce the &s;eptennial aft took place; and they defied the mo&s;t ingenious malice to prove that his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty had ever endeavoured to extend any branch of the prerogative beyond its legal bounds. Sir John Hynde Cotton affirmed, that in many parts of England the papi&s;ts had already begun to u&s;e all their influence in favour of tho&s;e candidates who were recommended by the mini&s;ters as mem|bers in the en&s;uing parliament. With re&s;pect to his maje&s;ty's conduct, he &s;aid he would not an&s;wer one word: but as to the gr$evanc$s introduced &s;ince the law was enacted for &s;eptennial parliaments, he thought him&s;elf more at liberty to declare his &s;entiments. He a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;eptenn$al law it&s;elf was an en|croachment on the rights of the people: a law pa&s;&s;ed by a parliament that made it&s;elf &s;eptennial. He ob&s;erved, that the laws of trea&s;on with regard to trials were altered &s;ince that period: that in former times a man was tried by a jury of his neighbours, within the country where the crimes alledged again&s;t him were &s;aid to be committed; but by an act of a &s;eptennial parliament he might be removed and tried in any place where the crown, or rather the mi|ni&s;try,
<PB N="559" REF="5620">
could find a jury proper for their purpo&s;e; where the pri&s;oner could not bring any witne&s;s in his ju&s;tification, without an expence which perhaps his circum&s;tances would not bear. He a&s;ked if the riot act was not an in|croachment on the rights of the people? An act by which a little dirty ju&s;tice of the peace, the meane&s;t and vile&s;t tool a mini&s;ter can u&s;e, who perhaps &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts by his being in the commi&s;&s;ion, and may be deprived of that &s;ub&s;i&s;tence at the plea&s;ure of his patron, had it in his power to put twenty or thirty of the be&s;t &s;ubjects in England to immediate death, without any trial or form but that of reading a proclamation. <Q>&startq;Was not the fatal South-&s;ea &s;cheme (&s;aid he) e&s;tabli&s;hed by the act of a &s;eptennial parliament? And can any man a&s;k, whether that law was attended with any inconvenience? To the glorious catalogue I might have added the late exci&s;e-bill, if it had pa&s;&s;ed into a law; but, thank heaven, the &s;eptennial parliament was near expiting before that famous mea&s;ure was introduced.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>Sir William Wyndham concluded an excellent &s;peech, that &s;poke him the unrivalled orator, the uncorrupted Briton, and the un&s;haken patriot, in words to this effect. <Q>&startq;Let us &s;uppo&s;e a man abandoned to all notions of virtue and honour, of no great family, and but a mean fortune, rai&s;$d to be chief mini&s;ter of &s;tate, by the concurrence of many whim&s;ical events; afraid, or unwilling to tru&s;t any but creatures of his own making, lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame and reputation; ignorant of his country's true intere&s;t, pur|&s;uing no aim but that of aggrandizing him&s;elf and his favourites; in fo|reign affairs, tru&s;ting none but tho&s;e who from the nature of their education, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be qualified for the &s;ervice of their country, or give weight and credit to their negotiations. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the true intere&s;t of the na|tion, by &s;uch means, neglected or mi&s;under&s;tood, her honour tarni&s;hed, her importance lo&s;t, her trade in&s;ulted, her merchants plundered, and her &s;ailors murdered; and all the&s;e circum&s;tances overlooked, le&s;t his admini&s;tration &s;hould be endangered. Suppo&s;e him next po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e wealth, the plunder of the nation, with a parliament chiefly compo&s;ed of members who&s;e &s;eats are purcha&s;ed, and who&s;e votes are bought at the expence of the public trea&s;ure. In &s;uch a parliament, &s;uppo&s;e all attempts made to inquire into his conduct, or to relieve the nation from the di&s;tre&s;s which has been in|tailed upon it by his admini&s;tration. Suppo&s;e him &s;creened by a corrupt majority of his creatures, whom he retains in daily pay, or engages in his particular intere&s;t, by di&s;tributing among them tho&s;e po&s;ts and places which ought never to be be&s;towed upon any but for the good of the public. Let him plume him&s;elf upon his &s;candalous victory, becau&s;e he has obtained a parliament like a packed jury ready to acquit him at all adventures. Let us &s;uppo&s;e him domineering with in&s;olence over all the men of antient fa|milies, over all the men of &s;en&s;e, figure, or fortune, in the nation: as he has no virtue of his own, ridiculing it in others, and endeavouring to de|&s;troy or corrupt it in all. With &s;uch a mini&s;ter, and &s;uch a parliament, let us &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e which I hope will never happen: a prince upon the throne uninformed, ignorant, and unacquainted with the inclinations and true in|t$re&s;t of his people, weak, capricious, tran&s;ported with unbounded ambi|tion, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with in&s;atiable avarice. I hope &s;uch a ca&s;e will never oc|cur; but, as it po&s;&s;ibly may, could any greater cur&s;e happon to a nation,
<PB N="560" REF="5630">
than &s;uch a prince on the throne, advi&s;ed, and &s;ol$ly advi&s;ed, by &s;uch a m$n$$ter, and that mini&s;ter &s;upported by &s;uch a parliament. The nature of $word$ cannot be $word$ by human laws, the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a prince $word$ a mini&s;ter $word$ cannot prevent by act of parliament; but the exi&s;tence of $word$ a $word$ I $span$ may prevent; as it is much more likely to exi&s;t, and $word$ $word$ mere $word$ while the &s;eptennial law remains in force, than if it were $word$ therefore I am heartily for its being repealed.&endq;</Q> $word$ the mo&s;t warm, the mo&s;t nervous, the mo&s;t pathetic $word$ in $word$ of the motion, the que&s;tion was put, and it was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by $word$ $word$ of number.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> The triumph of the mini&s;try was &s;till more complete in the &s;ucce&s;s of a me&s;&s;age delivered from the crown, in the latter end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, when a great many members of the other party had retired to their re&s;pective habi|tations in the country. Sir Robert Walpole delivered this commi&s;&s;ion to the hou&s;e, importing, that his maje&s;ty might be enabled to augment his forces, if occa&s;ion &s;hould require &s;uch an augmentation, between the di&s;&s;olution of this parliament and the election of another. Such an important point, that was &s;aid to &s;trike at the foundation of our liberties, was not tamely yielded; but, on the contrary, conte&s;ted with uncommon ardour. The motion for taking the me&s;&s;age into con&s;ideration was carried in the affirmative; and an addre&s;s pre&s;ented to the king, &s;ignifying their compliance with his de&s;ire. In con&s;equence of a &s;ub&s;equent me&s;&s;age, they prepared and pa&s;&s;ed a bill enabling his maje&s;ty to &s;ettle an annuity of five thou&s;and pounds for life on the prince&s;s-royal$ as a mark of his paternal favour and affection.</P>

<P>The oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of peers kept pace with that in the hou&s;e of commons, and was &s;upported with equal abilities, under the au&s;pices of the lords Bathur&s;t and Carteret, the earls of Che&s;terland and Abingdon. The duke of Marlborough made a motion for a bill to regulate the army, equivalent to that which had been rejected in the lower hou&s;e; and it met with the &s;ame fate, after a warm di&s;pute. Then the lord Carteret moved for an addre&s;s to the king, that he would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to acquaint the hou&s;e who advi&s;ed his maje&s;ty to remove the duke of Bolton and the lord vi&s;|count Cobham from their re&s;pective regiments; and what crimes were laid to their charge. This propo&s;al was likewi&s;e rejected, at the end of a debate in which the duke of Argyle ob&s;erved, that two lords had been removed, but only one &s;oldier had lo&s;t his commi&s;&s;ion. Such a great majority of the Scotti&s;h repre&s;entatives had always voted for the mini&s;try &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the late king; and &s;o many of the&s;e enjoyed places and preferments in the gift of the crown, that &s;everal attempts were made by the lords in the oppo&s;ition, to pre|vent for the future the mini&s;terial influence from extending it&s;elf to the elections of North-Britain. Accordingly, two motions for this purpo&s;e were made by the earl of Marchmont, and duke of Bedford; and &s;u&s;tained by the earls of Che&s;terfield, Winchel$ea, and Stair, the lords Willoughby de Broke, Bathur&s;t, and Carteret. They were oppo&s;ed by the dukes of Newca&s;tle and Argyle, the earl of Cholmon|dely, earl Poulet, lord Hervey, now called up by writ to the hou&s;e of peers, and lord Talbot. The que&s;tion being put in both, they were of cour&s;e defeated; and the earl of Stair was deprived of his regiment of dragoons, after having performed the mo&s;t &s;ignal &s;ervices to the royal family, and exhau&s;ted his
<PB N="561" REF="5640">
fortune in &s;upporting the intere&s;ts and dignity of the crown. Strenuous prote&s;ts were entered again&s;t the deci&s;ion of the majority, concerning the king's me&s;&s;age demanding a power to augment his forces during the rece&s;s of parlia|ment; as al&s;o again&s;t a bill for enabling his maje&s;ty to apply the &s;um of one million two hundred thou&s;and pounds out of the &s;inking-fund, for the &s;ervice of the current year. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion being di&s;patched, the king r$paired to the hou&s;e of lords on the &s;ixteenth day of April, and having pa&s;&s;ed all the bills that were ready for the royal a&s;&s;ent, took leave of this parliament, with the wa$me&s;t acknowledgment of their zeal, duty, and affection. It was at fir&s;t prorogued, then di&s;&s;olved, and another convoked by the &s;ame pro|clamation. On the fourteenth day of March, the nuptials of the prince of Orange and the prince&s;s royal were &s;olemnized with great magnificence; and this match was attended with addre&s;&s;es of congratulation to his maje&s;ty from different parts of the kingdom.</P>

<P>The powers at war upon the continent acted with &s;urpri&s;ing vi|gour. The Ru&s;&s;ian and Saxon army inve&s;ted the city of Dantzick, in hope of &s;ecuring the per&s;on of king Stani&s;laus. The town was &s;trong, the garri&s;on numerous; and animated by the examples of the French and Poles, made a very ob&s;tinate defence. For &s;ome time they were &s;upplied by &s;ea with recruits, arms, and, ammunition. On the eleventh day of May, a reinforcement of fifteen hundred men was landed from two French &s;hips of war and &s;ome tran|&s;ports, under Fort Wech&s;elmunde, which was &s;o much in want of provi&s;ions, that they were not admitted: they therefore reimbarked, and &s;ailed back to Copenhagen. But afterwards a larger number were landed in the &s;ame place, and attacked the Ru&s;&s;ian intrenchments, in order to force their way into the city. They were repul&s;ed in this attempt, but retired in good order. At length the Ru&s;&s;ian fleet arrived under the command of admiral Gordon; and now the &s;iege was carried on with great fury. Fort Wech&s;elmunde was &s;ur|rendered: the French troops capitulated, and were embarked in the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hips, to be conveyed to &s;ome port in the Baltic. Stani&s;laus e&s;caped in the di&s;|gui&s;e of a pea&s;ant to Marienwarder in the Pru&s;&s;ian territories. The city of Dantzick &s;ubmitted to the dominion of Augu&s;tus III. king of Poland, and was obliged to defray the expence of the war to the Ru&s;&s;ian general count de Munich, who had a&s;&s;umed the command after the &s;iege was begun. The Poli&s;h lords at Dantzick &s;igned an act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to king Augu&s;tus, who, on the tenth day of July, arrived at the convent of Oliva. There a council was held in his pre&s;ence. The recu&s;ant noblemen took the oath which he pro|po&s;ed. Then a general amne&s;ty was proclaimed; and the king &s;et out on his $eturn to Dre&s;den.</P>

<P>On the Rhine the French arms bore down all re&s;i&s;tance. The count de Bellei&s;le be&s;ieged and took Traerbach. The duke of Berwick, at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, inve&s;ted Philip&s;burg, while prince Eugene was obliged to remain on the defen&s;ive, in the &s;trong camp at Heilbron, wait|ing for the troops of the empire. On the twelfth day of June, the duke of Berwick, in vi&s;iting the trenches, was killed by a cannon-ball, and the com|mand devolved upon the marquis d'Asfeldt, who carried on the operations of the &s;iege with equal vigour and capacity. Prince Eugene being joined by the different reinforcements he expected, marched towards the French lines; but
<PB N="562" REF="5650">
found them &s;o &s;trong that he would not hazard an attack; and &s;uch precau|tions taken, that with all his military talents he could not relieve the be&s;ieged. At length general Watgen$$ the governor capitulated, after having made a no$$e defence, and obtained the mo&s;t honourable conditions. Prince Eugene retired to $word$ and the campaign ended about the beginning of Octo|ber. The $word$ arms were not more &s;ucce&s;sful in Italy. The infant Don Carlos had received &s;o many invitations from the Neapolitan nobility, that he re&s;olved to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that kingdom. He began his march in F e|bruary, at the head of the Spani&s;h forces; publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, declaring he was &s;ent by his father to relieve the kingdom of Naples from the oppre&s;&s;ion under which it groaned, and entered the capital amid&s;t the acclamations of the people: while the count de Vi&s;comti the German viceroy, finding him&s;elf unable to cope with the invaders thought proper to retire, after having thrown &s;uccours into Ga$$a and Capua. When he arrived at Nocera, he began to a&s;&s;emble the militia, with intent to form a camp at Barletta. The count de Montemar marched with a body of forces again&s;t this general, and obtained over him a complete victory at Bitonto in Apuglia, on the twenty-fifth of May, when the Imperiali&s;ts were entirely routed, and a great number of principal officers taken pri&s;oners. Don Carlos being proclaimed and ac|knowledged king of Naples, created the count de Montemar duke of Bitonto; reduced Gaeta, and all other parts of the kingdom which were garri&s;oned with Imperial troops, and re&s;olved to &s;ubdue the i&s;land of Sicily. About twenty thou&s;and troops being de&s;tined for this expedition, were landed in the road of Solanto in Augu&s;t, under the command of the new duke of Bitonto, who being favoured by the natives, proceeded in his conque&s;ts with great ra|pidity. The people acknowledged Don Carlos as their &s;overeign, and took arms in &s;upport of his government; &s;o that the Imperial troops were driven before them, and the Spaniards po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole kingdom, except Me&s;&s;ina, Syracu&s;e, and Trepani, when the infant determined to vi&s;it the i&s;land in per&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XX.</HEAD>
<P>While Don Carlos was thus employed in the conque&s;t of Naples and Sicily, the Imperiali&s;ts were hard pre&s;&s;ed in Lombardy by the united forces of France and Piedmont, commanded by the king of Sardinia and the old marechal duke de Villars. In the month of January they undertook the &s;iege of Tortona, which they reduced; while the troops of the emperor began to pour in great numbers into the Mantuan. In the beginning of May, count Merci, who commanded them, pa&s;&s;ed the Po in the face of the allies, not|with&s;tanding all the &s;kill of Villars, obliged him to retreat from the banks of that river, and took the ca&s;tle of Colorno. The old French general being taken ill, quitted the army and retired to Turin, where in a little time he died; and the king of Sardinia repairing to the &s;ame place, the command of the allied forces devolved upon the marechal de Coigny. The confederates were po&s;ted at Sanguina, and the Imperiali&s;ts at Sorbela, when the count de Merci made a motion to San Pro&s;pero, as if he intended either to attack the enemy, or take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Parma. The marechal de Coigny forthwith made a di&s;po&s;ition for an engagement; and, on the twenty-ninth day of June, the Imperial general having pa&s;&s;ed the Parma, began the attack with great impetuo&s;ity. He charged in per&s;on at the head of his troops, and was killed
<PB N="563" REF="5660">
&s;oon after the battle began. Neverthele&s;s, the prince of Wirtemberg a&s;&s;uming the command, both armies fought with great ob&s;tinacy, from eleven in the forenoon till four in the afternoon, when the Imperiali&s;ts retired towards Monte Cirugalo, leaving five thou&s;and men dead on the field of battle, and among the&s;e many officers of di&s;tinction. The lo&s;s of the allies was very con&s;ider|able, and they reaped no &s;olid fruits from their victory.</P>

<P>The Imperial forces retreated to Reggio, and from thence moved to the plains of Carpi, on the right of the Secchia, where they received &s;ome reinforcements; then general count Konig&s;egg arriving in the camp, took upon him&s;elf the command of the army. His fir&s;t &s;tep was to take po&s;t at Quingentolo, by which motion he &s;ecured Mirandola, that was threatened with a &s;iege. On the fifteenth of February, he forded the river Secchia, and &s;urpri&s;ed the quarters of marechal de Broglio, who e&s;caped in his &s;hirt with great difficulty. The French retired with &s;uch precipitation, that they left all their baggage behind, and above two thou&s;and were taken pri&s;oners. They po&s;ted them&s;elves under Gua&s;talla, where, on the nineteenth day of the month, they were vigorou&s;ly attacked by the Imperiali&s;ts, and a general engagement en&s;ued. Konig&s;egg made &s;everal de&s;perate efforts to break the French cavalry, upon which, however, he could make no impre&s;&s;ion. The infantry on both &s;ides fought with uncommon ardour for &s;ix hours, and the field was covered with carnage. At length the Imperial general retreated to Lazara, after having lo&s;t above five thou&s;and men, including the prince of Wirtemberg, the generals Valpareze and Colminero, with many other officers of di&s;tinction: nor was the damage &s;u&s;tained by the French greatly inferior to that of the Germans, who repa&s;&s;ed the Po and took po&s;t on the banks of the Oglio. The allies cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ame river, and the marquis de Maillebois was &s;ent with a de|tachment to attack Mirandola; but the Imperiali&s;ts marching to the relief of the place, compelled him to abandon the enterprize: then he rejoined his army, which retired under the walls of Cremona, to wait for &s;uccours from Don Carlos. So little re&s;pect did the French court pay to the Briti&s;h nation, at this juncture, that in the month of November an edict was publi&s;hed in Paris, commanding all the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in France, who were not actually in employment, from the age of eighteen to fifty, to quit the kingdom in fifteen days, or inli&s;t in &s;ome of the Iri&s;h regiments, on pain of being treated as vagabonds and &s;ent to the gallies. This edict was executed with the ut|mo&s;t rigour. The pri&s;ons of Paris were crouded with the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, who were &s;urpri&s;ed and cut off from all communication with their friends, and mu&s;t have peri&s;hed by cold and hunger, had not they been re|lieved by the active charity of the Jan&s;eni&s;ts. The earl of Waldegrave, who then re&s;ided at Paris as amba&s;&s;ador from the king of Great-Britain, made &s;uch vigorous remon&s;trances to the French mini&s;try, upon this unheard-of out|rage, again&s;t a nation with they had been &s;o long in alliance, that they thought proper to &s;et the pri&s;oners at liberty, and publi&s;h another edict, by which the meaning of the former was explained away.</P>

<P>While the&s;e tran&s;actions occurred on the continent, the king of Great-Britain augmented his land-forces; and warm conte&s;ts were maintained through the whole united kingdom in electing repre&s;entatives for the new par|liament. But in all the&s;e &s;truggles the mini&s;terial power predominated; and

the new members appeared with the old complexion. The two hou&s;es a&s;&s;embled on the fourteenth day of January, and Mr. On&s;low was re elected as &s;peaker. The leaders of both parties in all debates were the &s;elf &s;ame p r&s;ons who had cond$&s;ted the&s;e of the former parliament; and the &s;ame mea&s;ures were per&s;ued in the &s;ame manner. The king, in his &s;peech at the opening of the $word$ $span$ to $span$ that he had concerted with the $span$ of the $span$ as were thought $word$ for their $word$ $word$ and $span$ the peace of $word$ that they had con&s;idered $word$ one $word$ the $word$ applications made by the I$pe$$al $word$ both in $word$ and $word$ for obtaining &s;uccours again&s;t the powers at war with the $word$ of Au&s;tria; and on the other &s;ide, the repeated $word$ made by the allies, of their &s;incere di&s;po&s;ition to put an end to the pre&s;ent $word$ upon honourable and &s;olid terms: that he and the &s;tate-general had $word$ $n a re&s;olution to employ their joint and earne&s;t in&s;tances to bring matters to a &s;peedy and happy accommodation: that their good offices were at length $span$ and in a &s;hort time a plan would be offered to the con&s;ideration of all $word$ $word$ engaged in the war, as a ba&s;is for a general negotiation of peace. He told them he had u&s;ed the power ve&s;ted in him by the la&s;t parliament with great $word$ and con|cluded a treaty with the crown of Denmark of great importance in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. He ob&s;erved, that whil&s;t many of the principal powers of Europe were actually engaged in a war, Great-Britain mu&s;t be $word$ of le&s;s $word$ with the con&s;equences; and as the be&s;t concerted mea&s;ures are li$$l$ to uncer|tainty, the nation ought to be prepared again&s;t all events. He therefore ex|pre&s;&s;ed his hope, that his good &s;ubjects would not $word$ at the nece&s;&s;ary means of procuring the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and univer&s;al tr$$q$$llity, or of putting him in a condition to act that part which it might be $word$ and incumbent upon him to take. The addre&s;s of thanks produced a di&s;pute as u&s;ual, which ended with an acquie&s;cence in the motion. The hou&s;e, in a grand committee on the &s;upply, re&s;olved, That thirty thou&s;and men &s;hould be employed for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing years and, That the land-forces &s;hould be augmented to the number of twenty-five thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-four effective men. But the&s;e re&s;olutions were not taken without di&s;pute and divi&s;ion. The mi|ni&s;ter's opponents not only reproduced all the rea&s;ons which had been formerly advanced again&s;t a &s;tanding army, but they oppo&s;ed this augmentation with ex|traordinary ardour, as a huge &s;tride towards the e&s;tablishment of orbitary power. They refuted tho&s;e fears of external bro$s on which the $word$ pretended to ground the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an augmentation; and they $word$ the w$a$ con|duct of the admini&s;tration, in having contributed to $word$ the ballance of power, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting Spain again&s;t the emperor in $word$ &s;o its to $word$ the hou&s;e of B$ur$$n.</P>

&s;upported by Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll and Mr. Pulteney; but after &s;ome debate the motion was carried in the negative. When the new treaty with Denmark fell under con&s;ideration in a grand committee, Mr. H. Walpole moved, that the &s;um of fifty-&s;ix thou&s;and two hundred and fifty pounds &s;hould be granted to his maje&s;ty as a &s;ub&s;idy to the Dane, pur&s;uant to the &s;aid treaty, for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year. The demand did not meet with immediate compliance. All the leaders in the oppo&s;ition exclaimed again&s;t the &s;ub&s;idy as unnece&s;&s;ary and unrea&s;onable. They ob&s;erved, that as the Engli&s;h had no particular intere&s;t of their own for inducing them to engage in the pre&s;ent war, but only the danger to which the ballance of power might be expo&s;ed by that event; and as all the powers of Europe were as much, if not more intere&s;ted than the Engli&s;h in the pre&s;ervation of that ballance, &s;hould it ever be really endangered, they would certainly engage in its defence, without receiving any valuable con&s;ide|ration from Great-Britain; but, &s;hould the Engli&s;h be always the fir&s;t to take the alarm upon any rupture, and offer bribes and pen&s;ions to all the princes in Europe, the whole charge of pre&s;erving that ballance would fall upon Great-Britain: every &s;tate would expect a gratification from her, for doing that which it would otherwi&s;e be obliged to do for its own pre&s;ervation: even the Dutch might at la&s;t refu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t in trimming this ballance, unle&s;s Britain &s;hould &s;ub|mit to make the grand pen&s;ionary of Holland a pen&s;ionary of England, and take a number of their forces into Engli&s;h pay. The debate having had its free cour&s;e, the que&s;tion was put, and the motion approved by the majority. The mini&s;try allowed a bill to be brought in for limiting the number of officers in the hou&s;e of commons; but, at the &s;econd reading it was rejected upon a divi|&s;ion, after a learned debate, in which it appeared, that the oppo&s;ition had gained a valuable auxiliary in the per&s;on of lord Polwarth, &s;on to the earl of Marchmont, a nobleman of elegant parts, keen penetration, and uncommon vivacity, who &s;poke with all the fluency and fervour of elocution.</P>

<P>The minority in the hou&s;e of lords were not le&s;s vigilant and re&s;olute in detecting and oppo&s;ing every mea&s;ure which they thought would redound to the prejudice of their country. But the mo&s;t remarkable objectthat employed their at|tention during this &s;e&s;&s;ion was a very extraordinary petition, &s;ub&s;cribed by the dukes of Hamilton, Queen&s;berry, and Montro&s;e, the earls of Dundonald, Marchmont, and Stair, repre&s;enting, that undue influence had been u&s;ed in carrying on the election of the &s;ixteen peers for Scotland. The duke of Bedford, who delivered their petition to the hou&s;e, propo&s;ed a day for taking it into con&s;ideration; and to this they agreed. It was afterwards moved, that the con&s;ideration of it &s;hould be adjourned to a &s;hort day, before which the petitioners &s;hould be or|dered to declare whether they intended to controvert the la&s;t election of all the &s;ixteen peers, or the election of any, and which of them. This affair was of &s;uch an unprecedented nature, that the hou&s;e &s;eemed to be divided in opinion about the manner in which they ought to proceed. The parti&s;ans of the mi|n &s;try would have willingly &s;tilled the inquiry in the beginning; but, the peti|tioners were &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported in their claim to &s;ome notice, by the earls of Che&s;terfield, Abingdon, and Strafford, the lords Bathur&s;t and Carteret, that they could not di&s;mi&s;s it at once with any regard to decorum. The order of the hou&s;e, according to the motion explained above, being communicated by the lord|chancellor to the petitioners, they waited on him with a declaration, importing,
<PB N="566" REF="5690">
that they did not intend to controvert the election or return of the &s;ixteen peers for Scotland; but, they thought it their duty to lay before their lord&s;hips the evidence of &s;uch facts and undue methods, as appeared to them to be danger|ous to the con&s;titution; and might in future elections equally affect the right of the pre&s;ent &s;ixteen peers, as that of the other peers of Scotland, if not prevented by a proper remedy. This declaration being repeated to the hou&s;e, the duke of Devon&s;hire made a motion, that the petitioners might be ordered to lay before the hou&s;e in writing, in&s;tances of tho&s;e undue methods and illegal practices upon which they intended to proceed, and the names of the per&s;ons they &s;u&s;pected to be guilty. He was warmly oppo&s;ed by the country party; and a long debate en&s;ued, after which the que&s;tion was carried in favour of the motion, and the order &s;ignified to the petitioners. Next day their an&s;wer was read to the hou&s;e to this effect: That as they had no intention to &s;tate them|&s;elves accu&s;ers, they could not take upon them to name particular per&s;ons who might have been concerned in tho&s;e illegal practices; but who they were would undoubtedly appear to their lord&s;hips upon their taking the proper examinations: neverthele&s;s, they did humbly acquaint their lord&s;hips, that the petition was layed before them upon information that the li&s;t of the &s;ixteen peers for Scot|land had been framed previous to the elections by per&s;ons in high tru&s;t under the crown: that this li&s;t was &s;hewn to peers as a li&s;t approved by the crown; and was called the King's-li&s;t, from which there was to be no variation, unle&s;s to make way for one or two particular peers, on condition they &s;hould conform to mea&s;ures: that peers were &s;ollicited to vote for this li&s;t, without the liberty of making any alteration: that endeavours were u&s;ed to engage peers to vote for this li&s;t by promi&s;e of pen&s;ions, and offices civil and military to them&s;elves and relations, as well as by offers of money: that &s;ums were given for this purpo&s;e: that pen&s;ions, offices, and relea&s;es of debts owing to the crown, were actually granted to peers who concurred in voting for this li&s;t, and to their relations: and, that on the day of election a battalion of his maje&s;ty's troops was drawn up in the abbey-court of Edinburgh, contrary to cu&s;tom, and without any apparent cau&s;e but that of overawing the electors. This an&s;wer gave ri&s;e to another violent di&s;pute; but the majority voted it un&s;atisfactory, and the petition was rejected, though the re&s;olution was clogged with a vigorous prote&s;t.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1735.</NOTE> Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;couragement, the earl of Abingdon moved, That although the petition was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, an inquiry might be &s;et on foot touch|ing an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence to the liberties of the kingdom. The earl of Ilay declaring his belief, that no &s;uch illegal methods had been practi&s;ed, the other produced a pamphlet, intituled, The prote&s;ts of a great number of noble lords, entered by them at the la&s;t election of peers for Scotland. Exceptions being taken to a pamphlet, as an object unworthy of their notice, lord Bathur&s;t exhibited an authentic copy of tho&s;e prote&s;ts, extracted from the journal of that election, &s;igned by the two principal clerks, and witne&s;&s;ed by two gentlemen then attending in the lobby. The&s;e were accordingly read, and plainly demon|&s;trated the truth of the allegations contained in the petition. Nothing could be more &s;candalous, arrogant, and &s;hamefully flagrant than the conduct and de|portment of tho&s;e who acted the part of under&s;trappers to the mini&s;try on this occa&s;ion. But all this demon&s;tration, adorned and enforced by the charms and energy of eloquence, was like preaching in a de&s;art. A motion was made for
<PB N="567" REF="5700">
adjourning, and carried in the affirmative: a prote&s;t was entered, and the whole affair con&s;igned to oblivion. Divers other motions were made &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by the lords in the oppo&s;ition, and rejected by the invincible power of a majority. The uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s of the mini&s;try did not, however, prevent them from renewing the &s;truggle as often as an opportunity offered. They di&s;|puted the continuation of the &s;alt-tax, and the bill for enabling the king to apply the &s;um of one million out of the &s;inking fund for the &s;ervice of the current year, though &s;ucce&s;s did not attend their endeavours. They &s;up|ported with all their might a bill &s;ent up from the commons, explaining and amending an act of the Scotti&s;h parliament, for preventing wrongous impri|&s;onment, and again&s;t undue delays in trials. This was all the natives of Scot|land had in lieu of the Habeas-corpus act; though it did not &s;creen them from oppre&s;&s;ion. Yet the earl of Ilay undertook to prove they were on a footing with their neighbours of England in this re&s;pect; and the bill was thrown out on a divi&s;ion. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed on the fifteenth of May, when the king in his &s;peech to both hou&s;es, declared, that the plan of pacification concerted between him and the &s;tates-general had not produced the de&s;ired effect. He thanked the commons for the &s;upplies they had granted with &s;uch chearfulne&s;s and di&s;patch. He &s;ignified his intention to vi&s;it his German dominions; and told them he &s;hould con&s;titute the queen regent of the realm in his ab&s;ence. Im|mediately after the prorogation his maje&s;ty embarked for Holland in his way to Hanover.</P>

<P>By this time the good under&s;tanding between the courts of Ma|drid and Li&s;bon was de&s;troyed by a remarkable incident. The Portugue&s;e amba&s;|&s;ador at Madrid, having allowed his dome&s;tics to re&s;cue a criminal from the officers of ju&s;tice, all the &s;ervants concerned in that re&s;cue were dragged from his hou&s;e to pri&s;on, by the Spani&s;h king's order, with circum&s;tances of rigour and di&s;grace. His Portugue&s;e maje&s;ty being informed of this outrage, ordered repri&s;als to be made upon the &s;ervants of the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Li&s;bon. The two mini&s;ters withdrew abruptly to their re&s;pective courts. The two mo|narchs expre&s;&s;ed their mutual re&s;entment. The king of Spain a&s;&s;embled a body of troops on the frontiers of Portugal; and his Portugue&s;e maje&s;ty had recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of king George. Don Marcos Antonio d'Alzeveda was di&s;|patched to London with the character of envoy extraordinary; and &s;ucceeded in his commi&s;&s;ion according to his wi&s;h. In a little time after the king's depar|ture from England, Sir John Norris &s;ailed from Spithead with a powerful &s;quadron, in order to protect the Portugue&s;e again&s;t the Spaniards; and on the ninth day of June arrived at Li&s;bon, where he was welcomed as a deliverer. Mr. Keene, the Briti&s;h envoy at the court of Spain, had communicated to his catholic maje&s;ty the re&s;olution of his ma&s;ter to &s;end a powerful &s;quadron to Li&s;bon, with orders to guard that coa&s;t from in&s;ults, and &s;ecure the Brazil fleet, in which the merchants of Great-Britain were deeply intere&s;ted. Don Jo&s;eph Patinho, mini&s;ter of his catholic maje&s;ty, delivered a memorial to Mr. Keen, repre&s;enting, that &s;uch an expedition would affect the commerce of Spain, by intimidating foreign merchants from embarking their merchandize in the flota. But, in all probability, it prevented a rupture between the two crowns, and di&s;po&s;ed the king of Spain to li&s;ten to terms of accommodation.</P>

<P>The powers in alliance again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria having rejected the plan of pacification concerted by the king of Great-Britain and the &s;tates-general, Mr. Walpole amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague pre&s;ented a memorial to their high mightene&s;&s;es, de&s;iring they would without le&s;s of time put them&s;elves $n a po&s;ture of defence, by an augmentation of their forces at &s;ea and land, that they might take &s;uch vigorous &s;teps, in concert with Great-Britain, as the future conjuncture of affairs might require. But, before they would &s;ubject them+&s;elves to &s;uch expence, they re&s;olved to make further trial of their influence with the powers in alliance again&s;t the emperor; and conferences were renewed with the mini&s;ters of tho&s;e allies. The affairs of Poland became more and more unfavourable to the intere&s;t of Stani&s;laus; for, though a great number of the Poli&s;h nobility engaged in a confederacy to &s;upport his claim, and made re|peated efforts in his behalf, the palatine of Klow &s;ubmitted to Augu&s;tus; and even his brother the primate, after having &s;u&s;tained a long impri&s;onment, and many extraordinary hard&s;hips, was obliged to acknowledge that prince his &s;ove|regn. In Italy the arms of the allies &s;till continued to pro&s;per. Don Carlos landed in Sicily, and reduced the whole i&s;land, almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition; while the Imperiali&s;ts were forced to abandon all the territories they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Italy, except the Mantuan. The emperor being equally unable to cope with the French armies on the Rhine, implored &s;uccours of the czarina, who &s;ent thirty thou&s;and men to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This vigorous interpo&s;ition, and the &s;ucce&s;s of Augu&s;tus in Poland, di&s;po&s;ed the court of Ver&s;ailies to a pacifica|tion. A &s;ecret negotiation was begun between France and the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and the preliminaries were &s;igned without the concurrence or knowledge of Spain, Sardinia, and the maritime powers. In the&s;e articles it was &s;tipulated, That France &s;hould re&s;tore all the conque&s;ts &s;he had made in Germany: That the rever&s;ion of the dukedom of Tu&s;cany &s;hould be ve&s;ted in the duke of Lorraine: That Lorraine &s;hould be allotted to king Stani&s;laus; and after his death, be united to the crown of France: That the emperor &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the Milane&s;e, the Mantuan, and Parma: That the king of Sardinia &s;hould enjoy Vigevano and Novara: That Don Carlos &s;hould be acknowledged king of Naples and $word$ and retain the i&s;land of Elba, with all the Spani&s;h territories on the coa&s;t of $u&s;cany: and, That France &s;hould guaranty the pragmatic &s;anction.</P>

<P>The king of Great-Britain returned from Hanover to England in the month of November; and on the fifteenth day of January opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. On this occa&s;ion he congrtulated them on the near pro&s;pect of a general peace in Europe, in con&s;equence of the preliminary arti|cles to which the emperor and the king of France had agreed; and of which he had expre&s;&s;ed his approbation, as they did not differ in any e&s;&s;ential point from the plan of pacification which he and the &s;tates-general had offered to the belligerant powers. He told them that he had already ordered a con&s;iderable reduction to be made in his forces both by &s;ea and land; but, at the &s;ame time ob&s;erved, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to continue &s;ome extraordinary expence until a more perfect reconciliation &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed among the &s;everal powers of Europe. An addre&s;s of thanks was unanimou&s;ly voted, pre&s;ented, and graci|ou&s;ly received. After the hou&s;e had received &s;everal petitions from different counties and gentlemen, complaining of undue influence in elections for mem|bers

of parliament; it proceeded to con&s;ider of the &s;upply, and Sir Charles Wager moving, that fifteen thou&s;and &s;eamen &s;hould be employed for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, the propo&s;al was approved without oppo&s;ition.

Such was the fate of a motion for rai&s;ing the &s;upplies within the year, made by Mr. Sandys, and &s;upported by Sir John Barnard, Mr. Willimot, and other patriots, who demon&s;trated, that this was a &s;peedy and practicable expedient for di&s;charging the national debt, lowering the intere&s;t of money, reducing the price of labour, and encouraging a &s;pirit of commerce.</P>

<P>The bill for limiting the number of officers in the hou&s;e of com|mons was again revived. The king was impowered to borrow &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, chargeable on the &s;inking fund for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year; though this power was not ea&s;ily granted; and the hou&s;e re&s;olved to lay a duty of twenty &s;hillings per gallon on all &s;pirituous liquors, after it had ap|peared to the committee appointed for that purpo&s;e, that tho&s;e &s;pirits were per|nicious to the health and morals of the people. To this re&s;olution was added another, which amounted to a total prohibition, namely, that fifty pounds &s;hould be yearly payed to his maje&s;ty for a licence to be annually taken out by every per&s;on who &s;hould vend, barter, or utter any &s;uch &s;pirituous liquors. Mr. Walter Plumer, in a well concerted &s;peech, moved for the repeal of &s;ome clau&s;es in the te&s;t-act: the&s;e he repre&s;ented as a &s;pecies of per&s;ecution, in which pro|te&s;tant di&s;&s;enters were confounded with the roman catholics and enemies to the e&s;tabli&s;hment. He was &s;u&s;tained by lord Polwarth and Mr. Heathcote; but, Sir Robert Walpole was joined by Mr. Shippen again&s;t the motion as dangerous to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; and the que&s;tion being put, it was carried in the ne|gative. When Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e, according to order a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1736.</NOTE> bill founded on the re&s;olutions they had taken again&s;t &s;pirituous liquors, Sir Ro|bert Walpole acquainted them, by his maje&s;ty's command, that as the altera|tions propo&s;ed to be made by that bill in the duties charged upon all &s;pirituous liquors, might in a great degree affect &s;ome part of the civil-li&s;t revenues, his maje&s;ty, for the &s;ake of remedying &s;o great an evil as was intended by that bill to be prevented, did con&s;ent to accept any other revenue of equal value, to be &s;ettled and appropriated in lieu of his intere&s;t in the &s;aid duties. The bill was read a &s;econd time, and con&s;igned to a committee of the whole hou&s;e; but that for limiting the number of officers in the hou&s;e of commons, was thrown out at the &s;econd reading. Petitions again&s;t the bill touching the retail of &s;pirituous liquors were pre&s;ented by the traders to the Briti&s;h &s;ugar colonies, by the merchants of Bri&s;tol and Liverpool, repre&s;enting the hard&s;hips to which they would be expo&s;ed by a law which amounted to a prohibition of rum and &s;pirits di&s;tilled from mola&s;&s;es. In con&s;equence of the&s;e remon&s;trances, a mitigating clau&s;e was in&s;erted, in favour of the compo&s;ition known by the name of punch; and di&s;tillers were permitted to exerci&s;e any other employment. The &s;um of &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds was voted for making good the deficiencies that might happen in the civil li&s;t by this bill, which at length pa&s;&s;ed through the hou&s;e, though not without reiterated di&s;putes and warm altercation. Violent oppo&s;ition was

likewi&s;e made to a bill for the relief of the people called quakers, who offered a petition, repre&s;enting, that though from motives of con&s;cience they refu&s;ed the payment of $ythes, church-rates, ob$ations, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical dues, they were expo&s;ed to g$$evous &s;ufferings by pro&s;ecution in the exchequer, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and other courts, to the impri&s;onment of their per&s;ons, and the ruin of them and their families. A bill being prepared for their relief, was read and printed: then pe|titions were prefered again&s;t it by the clergy of Middle&s;ex, and of many other parts of the kingdom. Coun&s;el was heard in behalf of the&s;e petitioners, and &s;everal alterations propo&s;ed in the bill, which after long repeated debates &s;ur|mounted all oppo&s;ition, and was &s;ent up to the lords.</P>

<P>In the month of February the king had &s;ent two members of the privy-council to the prince of Wales, with a me&s;&s;age, propo&s;ing a marriage be|tween his royal highne&s;s and the prince&s;s of Saxegotha. The propo&s;al being agreeable to the prince, the marriage was celebrated on the twenty-&s;eventh day of April. Upon this occa&s;ion Mr. Pulteney moved for an addre&s;s of con|gratulation to his maje&s;ty, and was &s;upported by Mr. George Lyttleton and Mr. William Pitt, who &s;eized this opportunity of pronouncing elegant pane|gyrics on the prince of Wales and his amiable con&s;ort. The&s;e two young mem|bers &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the hou&s;e by their eloquence and &s;uperior talents. The attention of the hou&s;e was afterwards converted to a bill for the prevention of &s;muggling; and another for explaining the act for the more ef|fectual preventing bribery and corruption in the election of members to &s;erve in parliament. Both made their way through the lower hou&s;e, and were &s;ent up to the lords for their concurrence. The number of land-forces voted for the &s;ervice of the current year was reduced to &s;eventeen thou&s;and &s;even hundred and four effective men. The &s;upplies were rai&s;ed by the malt-tax and land-tax, at two &s;hillings in the pound, additional duties on mum, cyder, and perry, &s;tamped vellum, parchment, and paper; and by an act impowering his maje&s;ty to borrow &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds of the &s;inking fund. In this &s;e&s;&s;ion the parliament repealed the old &s;tatutes of England and Scotland again&s;t conjura|ration, witchcraft, and dealing with evil &s;pirits. The commons likewi&s;e pre|pared a bill to re&s;train the di&s;po&s;ition of lands in mortmain, whereby they be|came unalienable. Again&s;t this mea&s;ure petitions were pre&s;ented by the two univer&s;ities, the colleges of Eton, Winche&s;ter, and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and divers ho&s;pitals that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by charitable donations. In favour of the univer&s;ities and colleges a particular exempting clau&s;e was in&s;erted. Several other amendments were made in the bill, which pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, and obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent. Among the acts pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was one for naturalizing her royal highne&s;s the prince&s;s of Wales; and another for building a bridge cro&s;s the Thames from the New-palace Yard in the city of We&s;tmin&s;ter, to the oppo|&s;ite &s;hore in the county of Surry. The points chiefly debated in the hou&s;e of lords were the addre&s;s of thanks for his maje&s;ty's &s;peech, the mortmain bill, the quakers bill, which was thrown out, and that for the prevention of &s;mug|gling, which did not pa&s;s without divi&s;ion and prote&s;t. On the twentieth $ay of May the king clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, in which he told both hou&s;es, that a farther convention touching the execution of the preliminaries had been made and communicated to him by the emperor and mo&s;t chri&s;tian king: and, that negotiations were carrying on by the &s;everal powers engaged in the
<PB N="571" REF="5740">
late war, in order to &s;ettle a general pacification. He expre&s;&s;ed great concern at &s;eeing &s;uch &s;eeds of di&s;&s;atisfaction &s;own among his people: he prote&s;ted it was his de&s;ire, and &s;hould be his care, to pre&s;erve the pre&s;ent con&s;titution in church and &s;tate as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed: he recommended harmony and mutual affection among all prote&s;tants of the nation, as the great &s;ecurity of that happy e&s;ta|bli&s;hment; and &s;ignified his intention to vi&s;it his German dominions. Accord|ingly the parliament was no &s;ooner prorogued than he &s;et out for Hanover, after having appointed the queen regent in his ab&s;ence.</P>

<P>Such a degree of licentiou&s;ne&s;s prevailed over the whole nation, that the kingdom was filled with tumult and riots, which might have been prevented by proper regulations of the civil government in a due execution of the laws. The mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e di&s;turbances happened at Edinburgh on the &s;eventh day of September. John Porteous, who commanded the guard payed by that city, a man of a brutal di&s;po&s;ition and abandoned morals, had at the execution of a &s;muggler been provoked by &s;ome in&s;ults from the popu|lace, to order his men, without u&s;ing the previous formalities of the law, to fire with &s;hot among the crowd; by which precipitate order &s;everal innocent per|&s;ons lo&s;t their lives. Porteous was tried for murder, convicted, and received &s;entence of death; but the queen, as guardian of the realm, thought proper to indulge him with a reprieve. The common people of Edinburgh re&s;ented this lenity &s;hewn to a criminal who was the object of their dete&s;tation. They re|membered that pardons had been granted to divers military delinquents in that country, who had been condemned by legal trial. They &s;eemed to think tho&s;e were encouragements to oppre&s;&s;ion; they were fired by a national jealou&s;y; they were &s;timulated by the relations and friends of tho&s;e who had been mur|dered; and they re&s;olved to wreak their vengeance on the author of that tra|gedy, by depriving him of life on the very day which the judges had fixed for his execution. Thus determined, they a&s;&s;embled in different bodies, about ten of the clock at night. They blocked up the gates of the city, to prevent the admi&s;&s;ion of the troops that were quartered in the &s;uburbs. They &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;armed the town-guard: they broke open the pri&s;on doors, dragged Porteous from thence to the place of execution, and leaving him hanging by the neck on a dyer's pole, quietly di&s;per&s;ed to their &s;everal habitations. This exploit was performed with &s;uch conduct and deliberation as &s;eemed to be the re&s;ult of a plan formed by &s;ome per&s;ons of con&s;equence: it therefore became the object of a very &s;evere inquiry.</P>

<P>During this &s;ummer a rupture happened between the Turks and the Ru&s;&s;ians, which la&s;t reduced the city of A&s;oph on the Black-&s;ea, and over|ran the greate&s;t part of Crim Tartary. The czarina declared war again&s;t the Ottoman Porte, becau&s;e the Tartars of the Crimea had made incur&s;ions upon her frontiers; and when &s;he complained of the&s;e di&s;$rters to the vizir, &s;he re|ceived no &s;atisfaction: be&s;ides, a large body of Tartars had, by order of that mini&s;ter, marched through the Ru&s;&s;ian provinces, in de&s;pite of the empre&s;s, and committed terrible havoc in their route. The emperor was obliged to engage as a party in this war, by a treaty offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, which he had many years before concluded with the czarina. Yet, before he declared him&s;elf, he joined the maritime powers in offering his mediation to the &s;ultan, who was very well di&s;po&s;ed to peace; but, the czarina in&s;i&s;ted upon her retaining A&s;oph, which
<PB N="572" REF="5750">
her forces had reduced; and this pr$liminary article being rejected as di&s;honou|rable to the Ottoman empire, the court of Vienn$ began to make preparations for war. By this time all t$e bellig$rant powers in Italy had agreed to th$ pr$|$iminaries of p$$ce c$n$$uded between the emperor and France. The duke of Lorraine had e&s;pou&s;$d the emperor's elde&s;t daughter, the archdutche&s;s Maria T$ere&s;a$ and ceded Lorraine to France even before he &s;ucceeded to Tu&s;cany. Don Ca$los was cro$ned king of Sicily: Stani&s;laus abdicated the crown of Poland$ and Augu&s;tus was univer&s;ally acknowledged &s;overeign of that kingdom. The prelim$naries were approved and accepted by the diet of the empire: the king of Spain &s;ent ord$rs for his troops to evacuate Tu&s;cany; and the pro|vinces in Italy yielded to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Prince Eugene, who had ma|naged the intere&s;ts of the emperor on this occa&s;ion, did not live to &s;ee the happy fruits of his negotiation. He died at Vienna, in April, at the age of &s;eventy-three, leaving behind him the character of an invincible hero and con&s;ummate politician. He was not long &s;urvived by count Staremberg, another Imperial general, who ranked next to the prince in military reputation. About the &s;ame time Great-Britain &s;u&s;tained a national lo&s;s in the death of lord chancellor Talbot, who by his worth, probity, and acquired accompli&s;hments, had digni|fied the great office to which he had been rai&s;ed. He died univer&s;ally lamented, in the month of February, at the age of fifty-two; and was &s;ucceeded on the bench by the lord Hardwicke.</P>

<P>The king being indi&s;po&s;ed, in con&s;equence of having been fatigued by a very tempe&s;tuous pa&s;&s;ag$ from Holland, the parliament was prorogued from the twenty-fir&s;t day of January to the fir&s;t of February, and then the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened by commi&s;&s;ion. The lord chancellor, as one of the peers authori&s;ed by this commi&s;&s;ion, made a &s;peech in his maje&s;ty's name to both hou&s;es. With re&s;pect to foreign affairs, he told them, that the re&s;pective acts of ce&s;&s;ion being exchanged, and orders given for the evacuation and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;everal countries and places by the powers concerned, according to the allot|ment and di&s;po&s;ition of the preliminary articles, the great work of re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the general tranquillity was far adva$ced: that however, common prudence called upon them to be very attentive to the final conclu&s;ion of the new &s;ettlement. He &s;ai$ h$s maje&s;ty could not without &s;urprize and concern, ob&s;erve the many contrivances and attempts carried on, in various &s;hapes, and in different parts of the nation, tumultuou&s;ly to re&s;i&s;t and ob&s;truct the excution of the laws, and to violate the peace of the kingdom. That the con&s;ideration of the heighth to which the&s;e auda$ious practices might ri&s;e, if not timely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, afforded a melancholy pro&s;pect, and required particular attention, le$t they &s;hould affect private per&s;ons in the quiet enjoyment of their property, as well as the general peace and good order of the whole. After the commons had agreed to an ad|dre&s;s, and neard coun&s;el on &s;ome controverted elections, they $word$ to take the &s;upply into con&s;i$eration. They voted ten thou&s;and men $or $word$ &s;ea-&s;ervice. They continued for the land$&s;ervice the &s;ame number they had mainta$ned in times of tranqui$$$ty, amounting to &s;eventeen thou&s;and &s;$ven hundr$d and four; but this mea&s;ure was not adopted without oppo&s;ition: the mon$y w$s ra$$$d by the land and ma$t-taxes, and one million granted out of the $word$ $$nd.</P>

<P>The chief &s;ubject of contention that pre&s;ent$d it&s;$$f in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was a motion which Mr. Pult$n$y made f$r an addre&s;s to his
<PB N="573" REF="5760">
maje&s;ty, that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;ettle one hundred thou&s;and pounds a-year upon the prince of Wales. He repre&s;ented that &s;uch provi&s;ion was conforma|ble to the practice of antient times: that what he propo&s;ed had been enjoyed by his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty in the life-time of his father: and, that a &s;ettlement of this nature was rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary, to a&s;certain the independency of the ap|parent heir to the crown. The motion was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Sir Robert Walpole, as an encroachment on the prerogative; as an officious intermeddling in the king's family-affairs; and as an effort to &s;et his maje&s;ty and the prince at variance. But a mi&s;under&s;tanding it &s;eems had already happened in the royal family: for, the mini&s;ter in the mid&s;t of his harangue told the hou&s;e, by his maje&s;ty's command, that on the preceding day the king had &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the prince by &s;everal noblemen of the fir&s;t quality, importing, that his ma|je&s;ty had given order for &s;ettling a jointure upon the prince&s;s of Wales, &s;uitable to her high rank and dignity, which he would in a proper time lay before the parliament, in order to be rendered more certain and effectual: that, although his royal highne&s;s had not thought fit by any application to his maje&s;ty, to de|&s;ire that his allowance of fifty thou&s;and pounds might be rendered le&s;s preca|rious, the king, to prevent the bad con&s;equencees which he apprehended might follow from the undutiful mea&s;ures which his maje&s;ty was informed the prince had been advi&s;ed to pur&s;ue, would grant to his royal highne&s;s for his maje&s;ty's life, the &s;aid fifty thou&s;and pounds per annum, to be i&s;&s;ued out of the civil-li&s;t revenues, over and above the prince's revenues ari&s;ing from the dutchy of Corn|wall, which his maje&s;ty thought a very competent allowance, con&s;idering his own num$rous i&s;&s;ue, and the great expence which did and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attend an honourable provi&s;ion for the whole royal family: that the prince, by a verbal an&s;wer, de&s;ired their lord&s;hips to lay him with all humility at his maje&s;ty's feet: to a&s;&s;ure him, that he did and ever &s;hould retain the utmo&s;t duty for his royal per&s;on: that he was very thankful for any in&s;tance of his maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s to him or to the prince&s;s, and particularly for his maje&s;ty's gracious intention of &s;ettling a jointure upon her royal highne&s;s; but, that as to the me&s;&s;age, the affair was now out of his hands, and therefore he could give no an&s;wer to it: that his royal highne&s;s afterwards u&s;ed many dutiful expre&s;&s;ions towards his maje&s;ty; adding, "Indeed my lords, it is in other hands, and I am &s;orry for it;" or words to that effect. He then endeavoured to demon&s;trate, that the annual &s;um of fifty thou&s;and pounds was as much as the king could afford to allow for the prince's maintenance; and he expatiated upon the bad con&s;equences that might en&s;ue, if the &s;on &s;hould be rendered altogether independent of the father.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="35" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions did not pa&s;s unan&s;wered. Sir Robert Walpole had a&s;&s;erted, that the parliament had no right to interfere in the creation or maintenance of a prince of Wales; and, that in the ca&s;e of Richard II. who upon the death of his father the black prince, was created prince of Wales, in con|&s;$quence of an addre&s;s or petition from parliament, that mea&s;ure was in all pro|bability directed by the king him&s;elf. In an&s;wer to this a&s;&s;ertion it was ob|&s;erved, that probably the king would not have been &s;o forward in creating his grand&s;on prince of Wales, if he had not been forced into this &s;tep by his par|liament; for, Edward in his old age fell into a &s;ort of love-dotage, and gave him&s;elf intirely up to the management of his mi&s;tre&s;s Alice Pierce, and his &s;econd &s;on the duke of Lanca&s;ter; a circum&s;tance that rai&s;ed a mo&s;t rea&s;onable jea|lou&s;y
<PB N="574" REF="5770">
in the black prince, at that time on his death-bed, who could not but be anxious about the &s;a$ety and right of his only &s;on, whom he found he was &s;oon to leave a child in the hands of a doating grandfather, and an ambitious a&s;piring uncle. The &s;upporters of the motion ob&s;erved, that the allowance of fifty thou&s;and pounds was not &s;ufficient to defray the prince's yearly expence, with|out alotting one &s;hilling for acts of charity and munificence; and that the &s;everal deductions for land-taxes and fees reduced it to forty-three thou&s;and pounds. They affirmed, that his whole income, including the revenues of the dutchy of Cornwall did not exceed fifty-two thou&s;and pounds a-year, though, by his ma|je&s;ty's own regulation, the expence of the prince's hou&s;hold amounted to &s;ixty-three thou&s;and. They proved, that the produce of the civil-li&s;t exceeded nine hundred thou&s;and pounds, a &s;um above one hundred thou&s;and pounds a-year more than was enjoyed by his late maje&s;ty: that in the fir&s;t year of the late king the whole expence of his hou&s;hold and civil government did not much exceed four hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and pounds a-year. They ob&s;erved, that the parliament added one hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds annually for acts of charity and bounty, to|gether with the article of &s;ecret-&s;ervice money; and allowed one hundred thou|&s;and pounds for the maintenance of the prince of Wales: that the article of &s;ecret-&s;ervice money had prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed in the late reign: by an account which happened to be layed before the parliament, it appeared, that va&s;t &s;ums of money had been given for purpo&s;es which no body under&s;tood, and to per&s;ons whom no body knew. In the beginning of the following &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;everal mem|bers re&s;olved, that this extraordinary account &s;hould be taken into con&s;ideration; but the inquiry was warded off by the other party, who declared, that the par|liament could not examine any account which had been pre&s;ented to a former &s;e&s;&s;ion. The debate was $ierce and long; and ended in a divi&s;ion, by which the motion was rejected. A motion of the &s;ame nature was made by the lord Car|teret in the hou&s;e of peers, and gave ri&s;e to a very keen di&s;pute, maintained by the &s;ame arguments, and i&s;&s;uing in the &s;ame termination.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="36" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The next remarkable conte&s;t was occa&s;ioned by a motion of Sir R. Walpole, who propo&s;ed, that the &s;um of one million &s;hould be granted to his maje&s;ty, towards redeeming the like &s;um of the increa&s;ed capital of the South-&s;ea company, commonly called South-&s;ea annuities. Several members argued for the expediency of applying this &s;um to the payment of the debt due to the bank, as part of that incumbrance was &s;addled with an intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. whereas the intere&s;t payed for the other &s;ums that con&s;tituted the public debt, did not exceed four per cent. Many plau&s;ible arguments were offered on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion; and at length, the motion was carried in the affirmative. The hou&s;e having re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee, to con&s;ider of the national debt, Sir John Barnard made a motion, for enabling his maje&s;ty to rai&s;e money either by the &s;ale of annuities, or by borrowing at an intere&s;t not exceeding three per cent. to be applied towards redeeming the South-&s;ea annuities; and, that &s;uch of the &s;aid annuitants as &s;hould be inclined to &s;ub&s;cribe their re&s;pective an|nuities, &s;hould be preferred to all others. He &s;aid, that even tho&s;e public &s;ecurities which bore an intere&s;t of three per cent. only, were &s;old at a premium in Change-alley: he was therefore per&s;uaded, that all tho&s;e who were willing to give a premium for a three per cent. &s;ecurity, would gladly lend his money to the government at the &s;ame intere&s;t, &s;hould books of &s;ub&s;cription be opened
<PB N="575" REF="5780">
for that purpo&s;e, with an a&s;&s;urance that no part of the principal &s;hould be payed off for fourteen years. He expatiated upon the national advantages that would accrue from a reduction of intere&s;t. From ea&s;y and obvious calculations he inferred, that in a very little time the intere&s;t upon all the South-&s;ea annui|ties would be reduced from four to three per cent. without any danger to public credit, or breach of public faith: that then the produce of the &s;inking fund would amount to fourteen hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum, to be applied only towards redeeming the capital of the &s;everal trading companies: this mea&s;ure would bring every one of them &s;o much within the power of parlia|ment, that they would be glad to accept of three per cent. intere&s;t on any rea|&s;onable terms; in which ca&s;e the &s;inking fund would ri&s;e to one million &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum. Then the parliament might venture to annihilate one half of it, by freeing the people from the taxes upon coals, can|dles, &s;oap, leather, and other &s;uch impo&s;itions as lay heavy upon the poor la|bourers and manufacturers: the remaining part of the &s;inking fund might be applied towards the di&s;charge of tho&s;e annuities and public debts which bore an intere&s;t of three per cent. only, and afterwards towards dimini&s;hing the capi|tals of the &s;everal trading companies till the term of fourteen years &s;hould be expired; then the &s;inking fund would again amount to above a million yearly, which would be &s;ufficient for paying them off, and freeing the nation intirely from all its incumbrances. This &s;alutary &s;cheme was violently oppo&s;ed by alderman Heathcote and other parti&s;ans of the mini&s;try; yet all their objections were refuted: and, in order to defeat the project, they were obliged to have recour&s;e to artifice. Mr. Winnington moved, that all the public creditors, as well as the South-&s;ea annuitants, &s;hould be comprehended. Sir John Barnard demon&s;trated, that it might be ea&s;y for the government to borrow money at three per cent. &s;ufficient for paying off &s;uch of the proprietors of four and twenty millions as were not willing to accept of that intere&s;t, but extremely difficult to borrow enough to &s;atisfy the proprietors of four and forty millions, who might choo&s;e to have their principal rather than &s;uch an intere&s;t. Never|thele&s;s, re&s;olutions were founded on this and other alterations of the original &s;cheme; and a bill was immediately prepared. It produced many other de|bates, and was at la&s;t po&s;tponed by dint of mini&s;terial influence. The &s;ame venerable patriot who projected this &s;cheme, moved, that as &s;oon as the intere&s;t of all the national redeemable debt &s;hould be reduced to three per cent. the hou&s;e would take off &s;ome of the heavy taxes which oppre&s;&s;ed the poor and the manufacturers. But this motion was rejected by the majority.</P>

<P>The la&s;t di&s;putes of this &s;e&s;&s;ion were excited by a bill &s;ent down from the lords for puni&s;hing the magi&s;trates and city of Edinburgh, on account of the murder of John Porteous. In the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion lord Carteret recapitulated the &s;everal tumults and riots which had lately happened in different parts of the kingdom. He particularly in&s;i&s;ted upon the atrocious murder of captain Porteous, as a flagrant in&s;ult upon the government, and a violation of the public peace, &s;o much the more dangerous as it &s;eemed to have been concerted and executed with deliberation and decency. He &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome citizens of Edinburgh had been concerned in the murder, not only from this circum&s;tance, but likewi&s;e becau&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the reward of two hun|dred pounds which had been offered by proclamation for the di&s;covery of any
<PB N="576" REF="5790">
per&s;on who acted in that tragedy, not one individual had as yet been detected. He &s;eemed to think, that the magi&s;trates had encouraged the riot, and that the city had forfeited its charter; and he propo&s;ed a minute inquiry into the par|ticulars of the affair. He was &s;econded by the duke of Newca&s;tle and the earl of Ilay; though this la&s;t nobleman differed in opinion from him with re&s;pect to the charter of the city, which he &s;aid could not be ju&s;tly forfeited by the fault of the magi&s;tracy. The lords re&s;olved, That the magi&s;trates and other per|&s;ons from whom they might obtain the nece&s;&s;ary information concerning this riot, &s;hould be ordered to attend: and, That an addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, de&s;iring, that the different accounts and papers relating to the mur|der of captain Porteous, might be &s;ubmitted to the peru&s;al of the hou&s;e. The&s;e documents being accordingly examined, and all the witne&s;&s;es arrived, including three Scotti&s;h judges, a debate aro&s;e about the manner in which the&s;e &s;hould be interrogated, whether at the bar, at the table, or on the wool&s;acks. Some Scotti&s;h lords a&s;&s;erted, that they had a right to be &s;eated next to the judges of England; but after a long debate this claim was rejected, and the judges of Scotland appeared at the bar in their robes. A bill was brought in to di&s;able Alexander Wil&s;on, e&s;quire, lord-provo&s;t of Edinburgh, from enjoying any office or place of magi&s;tracy in the city of Edinburgh, or el&s;ewhere in Great-Britain; for impri&s;oning the &s;aid Alexander Wil&s;on; for aboli&s;hing the guard of that city; and for taking away the gates of the Nether-Bow-Port, &s;o as to open a communication between the city and the &s;uburbs in which the king's troops are quartered. The duke of Argyle, in arguing again&s;t this bill, &s;aid, he could not think of a proceeding more har&s;h or unprecedented than the pre|&s;ent, as he believed there was no in&s;tance of the whole weight of parliamentary indignation, for &s;uch he called a proceeding by a bill ex po&s;t facto, falling upon any &s;ingle per&s;on, far le&s;s upon any community, for crimes that were within the reach of the inferior courts of ju&s;tice: for this rea&s;on he ob&s;erved, that if the lord-provo&s;t and citizens of Edinburgh &s;hould &s;uffer in the terms of the pre&s;ent bill, they would &s;uffer by a cruel, unju&s;t, and a fanta&s;tical proceed|ing; a proceeding of which the wor&s;t u&s;e might be made, if ever the nation &s;hould have the misfortune to fall under a partial &s;elf-intere&s;ted admini&s;tration. He told them he &s;at in the parliament of Scotland when that part of the treaty of union relating to the privileges of the royal burghs, was &s;ettled on the &s;ame footing as religion, that is, they were not alterable by any &s;ub&s;equent parlia|ment of Great-Britain. Notwith&s;tanding the eloquence and warmth of his remon&s;trance, the bill was &s;ent down to the hou&s;e of commons, where it pro|duced a violent conte&s;t. The commons &s;et on foot a &s;evere &s;crutiny into the particular circum&s;tances that preceded and attended the murder of Porteous; and from the examination of the evidences it appeared, that no freeman or citizen of Edinburgh was concerned in the riot, which was chiefly compo&s;ed of country-people, excited by the relations of &s;ome unhappy per&s;ons whom Porteous and his men had &s;lain at the execution of the &s;muggler; and the&s;e were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by prentice boys and the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of vagabonds that happened to be at Edinburgh: that the lord-provo&s;t had taken all the precautions to prevent mi&s;chief that his reflection &s;ugge&s;ted; that he even expo&s;ed his per&s;on to the rage of the multitude, in his endeavours to di&s;per&s;e them; and, that if he had done ami&s;s, he erred from want of judgment, rather than from want of

inclination to protect the unhappy Porteous. It likewi&s;e appeared, that Mr. Lind&s;ay, member for the city of Edinburgh, had gone in per&s;on to general Moyle, commander of the forces in North-Britain, informed him of the riot, implored his immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and promi&s;ed to conduct his troops into the city; and that his &s;uit was rejected becau&s;e he could not produce a written order from the magi&s;tracy, which he neither could have obtained in &s;uch confu&s;ion, nor ventured to carry about his per&s;on through the mid&s;t of an enraged popu|lace. The Scotti&s;h members exerted them&s;elves with uncommon vivacity in defence of their capital. They were joined by Sir John Barnard, lord Corn|bury, Mr. Shippen, and Mr. Oglethorpe. Lord Polwarth declared, that if any gentleman would &s;hew where one argument in the charge again&s;t the lord-provo&s;t and city of Edinburgh had been proved, he would that in&s;tant give his vote for the commitment of the bill. He &s;aid, if gentlemen would lay their hands upon their hearts, and a&s;k them&s;elves, whether they would have voted in that manner, had the ca&s;e of Edinburgh been that of the city of Bri&s;tol, York, or Norwich, he was per&s;uaded they would have required, that every tittle of the charge again&s;t them &s;hould have been fully and undeniably proved. Some amendments and mitigations being in&s;erted in the bill, it pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e, was &s;ent back to the lords, who agreed to the alterations; and then it received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>

<P>The next effort of the mini&s;ter was obliquely levelled at the liberty of the pre&s;s, which it was much for his intere&s;t to abridge. The errors of his conduct, the my&s;tery of that corruption which he had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully re|duced to a &s;y&s;tem, and all the blemi&s;hes of his admini&s;tration, had been expo&s;ed and ridiculed, not only in political periodical writings produced by the mo&s;t eminent hands, but likewi&s;e in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of theatrical pieces, which met with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s among the people. He either wanted judgment to di&s;tin|gui&s;h men of genius, or could find none that would engage in his &s;ervice. He therefore employed a &s;et of wretched authors, void of under&s;tanding and inge|nuity. They undertook the defence of his mini&s;try, and an&s;wered the ammad|ver&s;ions of his antagoni&s;ts. The match was &s;o extremely unequal, that in|&s;tead of ju&s;tifying his conduct, they expo&s;ed it to additional ridicule and con|tempt; and he &s;aw him&s;elf in danger of being de&s;pi&s;ed by the whole nation. He re&s;olved to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity to choak tho&s;e canals through which the torrent of cen&s;ure had flowed upon his character. The manager of a playhou&s;e communicated to him a manu&s;cript farce, intituled, The golden rump, which was fraught with trea&s;on and abu&s;e upon the government, and had been pre&s;ented to the &s;tage for exhibition. This performance was produced in the hou&s;e of commons. The mini&s;ter de&s;canted upon the in&s;olence, the malice, the immorality, the &s;editious calumny, which had been of late propagated in theatrical pieces. A bill was brought in to limit the number of playhou&s;es; to &s;ubject all dramatic writers to the in&s;pection of the lord-chamberlain, and compel them to take out a licence for every production before it could appear on the &s;tage. Notwith&s;tanding a vigorous oppo&s;ition, this bill pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es with extraordinary di&s;patch, and obtained the royal &s;anction. In this debate the earl of Che&s;terfield di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by an excellent &s;peech, that will ever endear his character to all the friends of genius and literature, to all tho&s;e who are warmed with zeal for the liberties of their country. <Q>&startq;Our

&s;tage, &s;aid he, ought certainly to be kept within due bounds; but, for this purpo&s;e, our laws as they &s;tand at pre&s;ent are &s;ufficient. If our &s;tage-players at any time exceed tho&s;e bounds, they ought to be pro&s;ecuted; they may be puni&s;hed. We have precedents, we have examples of per&s;ons puni&s;hed for things le&s;s criminal than &s;ome pieces which have been lately repre&s;ented: a new law mu&s;t therefore be unnece&s;&s;ary; and in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it cannot be unnece&s;&s;ary without being dangerous. Every unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint is a fetter upon the legs, is a &s;hackle upon the hands of liberty. One of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings a people can enjoy, is liberty. But every good in this life has its allay of evil. Licentiou&s;ne&s;s is the allay of liberty. It is an ebullition, an excre&s;cence; it is a &s;peck upon the eye of the political body, which I can never touch but with a gentle&mdash;with a trem|bling hand, le&s;t I de&s;troy the body; le&s;t I injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear. If the &s;tage becomes at any time licentious, if a play appears to be a libel upon the government, or upon any particular man, the king's courts are open, the law is &s;ufficient to puni&s;h the offender. If poets and players are to be re&s;trained, let them be re&s;trained as other &s;ubjects are, by the known laws of their country; if they offend, let them be tried as every Engli&s;hman ought to be, by God and their country. Do not let us &s;ubject them to the arbitrary will and plea&s;ure of any one man. A power lodged in the hands of a &s;ingle man to judge and determine without limitation, con|trol or appeal, is a &s;ort of power unknown to our laws, incon&s;i&s;tent with our con&s;titution. It is a higher, a more ab&s;olute power than we tru&s;t even to the king him&s;elf; and therefore I mu&s;t think, we ought not to ve&s;t any &s;uch power in his maje&s;ty's lord-chamberlain.&endq;</Q> His arguments had no effect, though the hou&s;e admired his elocution; and the playhou&s;e bill pa&s;&s;ed into a law. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of June the king made a &s;hort &s;peech to both hou&s;es, and the lord-chancellor prorogued the parliament.</P>

<P>A Congre&s;s had been opened at Niemerow in Poland, to compromi&s;e the differences between the czarina and the grand &s;ignor; but, this proving ineffectual, the emperor declared war again&s;t the Turk, and demanded a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the diet of the empire. He concerted the operations of the campaign with the empre&s;s of Mu&s;covy; and it was agreed, that the Imperia|li&s;ts under count Seckendorf &s;hould attack Widin in Servia, while the Ru&s;|&s;ians, commanded by count de Munich, &s;hould penetrate to the Ukraine, and be&s;iege Oczakow on the Bori&s;thenes. They accordingly advanced again&s;t this place, which was garri&s;oned by twenty thou&s;and men; and on the &s;ide of the Bori&s;thenes, defended by eighteen gallies. The Mu&s;covites carried on their approaches with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity and per&s;everance, that the Turks were ter|rified at their valour, and in a few days capitulated. Among tho&s;e who &s;igna|lized them&s;elves by uncommon marks of prowe&s;s in the&s;e attacks, was general Keith, now field-mar&s;hal in the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice, who was dangerou&s;ly wounded
<PB N="580" REF="5830">
on this occa&s;ion. Mean while count Seckendorf finding it impo&s;&s;ible to reduce Widin without a &s;quadron of &s;hips on the Danube, turned his arms again&s;t Ni&s;&s;a, which was &s;urrendered to him on the eight and twentieth day of July. But this was the farthe&s;t verge of his good fortune. The Turks attacked the po&s;ts which the Imperiali&s;ts occupied along the Danube. They took the fort of Padudil, burned the town of Ilas in Walachia, and plundered the neighbouring villages. The prince of Saxe-hildburghau&s;en, who had inve&s;ted Bagnalack in Bo&s;nia, was defeated and obliged to repa&s;s the Saave. Count Seckendorf was recalled to Vienna; and the command of the army devolved upon count Phi|lippi. Count Kevenhuller was obliged to retreat from Servia; and Ni&s;&s;a was retaken by the Mu&s;&s;$lmans. The conferences at Niemcrow were broken off; and the Turki&s;h plenipotentiaries returned to Con&s;tantinople.</P>

<P>The kingdom of Poland now enjoyed the mo&s;t perfect repo&s;e under the dominion of Augu&s;tus. Ferdinand, the old duke of Courland, dying without i&s;&s;ue the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was di&s;puted by the Teutonic order and the kingdom of Po|land, while the &s;tates of Courland claimed a right of election, and &s;ent deputies to Petersburgh, imploring the protection of the czarina. A body of Ru&s;&s;ian troops immediately entered that country; and the &s;tates elected the count de Biron, high-chamberlain to the empre&s;s of Mu&s;covy. The elector of Cologne, as grand-ma&s;ter of the Teutonic order, prote&s;ted again&s;t this election; but, the king of Poland agreed to it, on certain conditions &s;ettled at Dantzick, with the commi&s;&s;aries of the new duke and tho&s;e of the czarina. In the month of July John Ga&s;ton de Medicis, great duke of Tu&s;cany, died at Florence; and the prince de Craon took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his territories in the name of the duke of Lorrain, to whom the emperor had already granted the eventual inve&s;titure of that dutchy.</P>

<P>In England the attention of the public was attracted by an open breach in the royal family. The prince&s;s of Wales had advanced to the very la&s;t month of her pregnancy before the king and queen were informed of her being with child. She was twice conveyed from Hampton-court to the palace of St. James's, when her labour-pains were &s;uppo&s;ed to be approaching; and at length was delivered of a prince&s;s in about two hours after her arrival. The king being apprized of this event, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age by the earl of E&s;&s;ex to the prince, expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;plea&s;ure at the conduct of his royal highne&s;s, as an in|dignity offered to him&s;elf and the queen. The prince deprecated his maje&s;ty's anger in &s;everal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letters, and implored the queen's mediation. The prince&s;s joined her intreaties to tho&s;e of his royal highne&s;s; but all their humi+lity and &s;upplication proved ineffectual. The king, in another me&s;&s;age &s;ent by the duke of Grafton, ob&s;erved, that the prince had removed the prince&s;s twice in the week immediately preceding the day of her delivery, from the place of his maje&s;ty's re&s;idence, in expectation of her labour; and both times on his return, indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed from the knowledge of the king and queen every cir|cum&s;tance relating to this important affair. That at la&s;t, without giving any notice to their maje&s;ties, he had precipitately hurried the prince&s;s from Hamp|ton-court in a condition not to be named: that the whole tenour of his con|duct, for a con&s;iderable time, had been &s;o intirely void of all real duty to the king, that his maje&s;ty had rea&s;on to be highly offended with him. He gave him to under&s;tand, that until he &s;hould withdraw his regard and confidence from
<PB N="581" REF="5840">
tho&s;e by who&s;e in&s;tigation and advice he was directed and encouraged in his unwarrantable behaviour to his maje&s;ty and the queen, and return to his duty, he &s;hould not re&s;ide in the palace: he therefore &s;ignified his plea&s;ure that he &s;hould leave St. James's, with all his family, when it could be done without prejudice or inconvenience to the prince&s;s. In obedience to this order, the prince retired to Kew, and made other efforts to be readmitted into his ma|je&s;ty's favour, which, however, he could not retrieve. Whatever might have been his de&s;ign in concealing &s;o long from the king and queen the pregnancy of the prince&s;s, and afterwards hurrying her from place to place in &s;uch a con|dition, to the manife&s;t hazard of her life, his maje&s;ty had certainly cau&s;e to be offended at this part of his conduct; though the puni&s;hment &s;eems to have been &s;evere, if not rigorous; for he was not even admitted into the pre&s;ence of the queen his mother, to expre&s;s his duty to her, in her la&s;t moments, to implore her forgivene&s;s, and receive her la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing. She died of a mortifi|cation in her bowels, on the twentieth day of November, in the fifty-fifth year of her age, regretted as a prince&s;s of uncommon &s;agacity, and as a pat|tern of conjugal virtue.</P>

<P>The king opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament on the twenty-fourth day of January, with a &s;hort &s;peech, recommending the di&s;patch of the pub|lic bu&s;ine&s;s with prudence and unanimity. Each hou&s;e pre&s;ented a warm addre&s;s of condolence on the queen's death, with which he &s;eemed to be ex|tremely affected. Though the hou&s;e of commons unanimou&s;ly &s;ympathized with the king in his affliction, the mini&s;ter &s;till met with contradiction in &s;ome of his favourite mea&s;ures. One would imagine that all the arguments for and again&s;t a &s;tanding army in time of peace, had been already exhau&s;ted; but, when it was moved that the &s;ame number of land-forces which they had voted in the preceding year &s;hould be continued in pay for the en&s;uing year, the di&s;pute was renewed with &s;urpri&s;ing vivacity, and produced &s;ome rea&s;ons which had not been &s;ugge&s;ted before. The adherents of the mini&s;ter fairly owned, that if the army &s;hould be di&s;banded, or even con&s;iderably reduced, they believed the Tory intere&s;t would prevail: that the pre&s;ent number of forces was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to maintain the peace of the kingdom, which was filled with clamour and di&s;content, as well as to &s;upport the Whig intere&s;t; and that they would vote for keeping up four times the number, &s;hould it be found expe|dient for that purpo&s;e. The members in the oppo&s;ition replied, that this de|claration was a &s;evere &s;atire on the mini&s;try, who&s;e conduct had given birth to &s;uch a &s;pirit of di&s;content. They &s;aid it was in effect a tacit acknowledg|ment, that what they called the Whig intere&s;t was no more than an incon&s;ider|able party which had engro&s;&s;ed the admini&s;tration by indirect methods; which acted contrary to the &s;en&s;e of the nation, and depended for &s;upport upon a military power, by which the people in general were overawed, and con&s;e|quently en&s;laved. They affirmed, that the di&s;content of which the mini&s;try complained, was in a great mea&s;ure owing to that very &s;tanding army which perpetuated their taxes, and hung over their heads, as the in&s;truments of arbi|trary power and oppre&s;&s;ion. Lord Polworth explained the nature of Whig principles, and demon&s;trated, that the party which di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf by this appellation, no longer retained the maxims by which the Whigs were origi|nally characteri&s;ed. Sir John Hynde Cotton, who &s;poke with the courage
<PB N="582" REF="5850">
and freedom of an old Engli&s;h baron, declared he never knew a member of that hou&s;e who acted on true Whig principles vote for a &s;tanding army in time of peace. <Q>&startq;I have heard of Whigs (&s;aid he) who oppo&s;ed all unlimited votes of credit: I have heard of Whigs who looked upon corruption as the greate&s;t cur&s;e that could befall any nation: I have heard of Whigs who e&s;teemed the liberty of the pre&s;s to be the mo&s;t valuable privilege of a free people, and triennial parliaments as the greate&s;t bulwark of their liberties; and I have heard of a Whig admini&s;tration which had re&s;ented injuries done to the trade of the nation, and revenged in&s;ults offered to the Briti&s;h flag.&endq;</Q> The mini&s;try triumphed as u&s;ual, and the &s;ame number of forces was con|tinued.</P>

<P>Ever &s;ince the treaty of Seville, the Spaniards in America had almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly in&s;ulted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the commerce of Great-Britain. They di&s;|puted the right of Engli&s;h traders to cut logwood in the bay of Campeachy, and gather &s;alt on the i&s;land of I ortugas; though that right was acknowledged by implication in all the treaties which had been lately concluded between the two nations. The captains of their armed ve&s;&s;els, known by the name of guard$ co&s;tas, had made a practice of boarding and plundering Briti&s;h &s;hips, on pretence of &s;earching for contraband commodities, on which occa&s;ions they had behaved with the utmo&s;t in&s;olence, cruelty, and rapine. Some of their &s;hips of war had actually attacked a fleet of Engli&s;h merchant-&s;hips at the i&s;land of Tortugas, as if they had been at open enmity with England. They had &s;eized and detained a great number of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, impri&s;oned their crews and confi&s;cated their cargoes, in violation of treaties, in defiance of common ju&s;tice and humanity. Repeated memorials were pre&s;ented to the court of Spain, by the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Madrid. He was amu&s;ed with eva&s;ive an&s;wers, vague promi&s;es of inquiry, and cedulas of in&s;tructions &s;ent to the Spani&s;h governors in America, to which they payed no &s;ort of regard. Not but that the Spaniards had rea&s;on to complain in their turn, of the illicit com|merce which the Engli&s;h traders from Jamaica and other i&s;lands carried on with their &s;ubjects on the continent of South-America; though this could not ju&s;tify the depredations and cruelties which the commanders of the guarda co&s;tas had committed, without provocation or pretence.</P>

<P>The merchants of England loudly complained of the&s;e outrages: the nation was fired with re&s;entment, and cried for vengeance; but the mi|ni&s;ter appeared cold, phlegmatic, and timorous. He knew that a war would involve him in &s;uch difficulties as mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity endanger his admini&s;tra|tion. The trea&s;ure which he now employed for dome&s;tic purpo&s;es, mu&s;t in that ca&s;e be expended in military armaments: the wheels of that machine on which he had rai&s;ed his influence would no longer move: the oppo&s;ition would of con&s;equence gain ground, and the impo&s;ition of fre&s;h taxes, nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of the war, would fill up the mea&s;ure of popular re&s;entment again&s;t his per&s;on and mini&s;try. Moved by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly endeavoured to avoid a rupture, and to obtain &s;ome &s;ort of &s;atisfaction by dint of memorials and negotiations, in which he betrayed his own fears to &s;uch a degree as encouraged the Spaniards to per&s;i&s;t in their depredations, and the court of Madrid to di&s;regard the remon&s;trances of the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador. But his apprehen&s;ion of war did not proceed from Spain only: the two branches
<PB N="583" REF="5860">
of the hou&s;e of Bourbon were now united by politics as well as by con&s;angui|nity; and he did not doubt, that in ca&s;e of a rupture with Spain, they would join their forces again&s;t Great-Britain. Petitions were delivered to the hou&s;e by merchants from different parts of the kingdom, explaining the re|peated violences to which they had been expo&s;ed, and imploring relief of the parliament. The&s;e were referred to a committee of the whole hou&s;e; and an order was made to admit the petitioners, if they &s;hould think fit to be heard by them&s;elves or by coun&s;el. Sir John Barnard moved for an addre&s;s to the king, that all the memorials and papers relating to the Spani&s;h depredations &s;hould be layed before the hou&s;e; and this, with &s;ome alteration propo&s;ed by Sir Robert Walpole, was actually pre&s;ented. In compliance with the reque&s;t, an enormous multitude of letters and memorials was produced.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e, in a grand committee, proceeded to hear coun&s;el for the merchants, and examine evidence; by which it appeared that amazing acts of wanton cruelty and inju&s;tice had been perpetrated by Spaniards on the &s;ub|jects of Great-Britain. Mr. Pulteney expatiated upon the&s;e circum&s;tances of barbarity. He demon&s;trated, from treaties, the right of the Briti&s;h traders to the logwood of Campeachy, and the &s;alt of Tortugas: he expo&s;ed the pu&s;illa|nimity of the mini&s;ter, and the futility of his negotiations; and he moved for &s;uch re&s;olutions as would evince the re&s;entment of an injured nation, and the vigour of a Briti&s;h parliament. The&s;e were warmly combated by Sir Robert Walpole, who affirmed they would cramp the mini&s;ters in their en|deavours to compromi&s;e the&s;e differences: that they would fru&s;trate their ne|gotiations, intrench upon the king's prerogative, and precipitate the nation into an unnece&s;&s;ary and expen&s;ive war. An&s;wers produced replies, and a ge|neral debate en&s;ued. A re&s;olution was reported; but the que&s;tion being put for recommitting it, was carried in the negative. The hou&s;e, however, agreed to an addre&s;s, be&s;eeching his maje&s;ty to u&s;e his endeavours to obtain effectual relief for his injured &s;ubjects, to convince the court of Spain that his maje&s;ty could no longer &s;uffer &s;uch con&s;tant and repeated in&s;ults and injuries to be carried on, to the di&s;honour of his crown, and to the ruin of his trading &s;ub|jects; and a&s;&s;uring him, that in ca&s;e his royal and friendly in&s;tances with the catholic king &s;hould mi&s;carry, the hou&s;e would effectually &s;upport his maje&s;ty in taking &s;uch mea&s;ures as honour and ju&s;tice &s;hould make it nece&s;&s;ary for him to pur&s;ue. To this addre&s;s the king made a favourable an&s;wer.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1738.</NOTE> The next important &s;ubject on which both &s;ides exerci&s;ed their ta|lents, was a bill prepared and brought in by Mr. Pulteney, for the more ef|fectual &s;ecuring the trade of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in America. This was no other than the revival of part of two acts pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of queen Anne, by which the property of all prizes taken from the enemy was ve&s;ted in the captors; and the &s;overeign was empowered to grant commi&s;&s;ions or charters to any per&s;ons or &s;ocieties, for taking any &s;hips, goods, harbours, lands, or fortifications of the nation's enemies in America, and for holding and enjoy|ing the &s;ame as their own property and e&s;tate for ever. The mini&s;try en|deavoured to evade the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this bill, by amu&s;ing the hou&s;e with other bu&s;ine&s;s, until an end &s;hould be put to the &s;e&s;&s;ion. A mean artifice was practi&s;ed with this view; and &s;ome &s;evere altercation pa&s;&s;ed between Sir Robert Walpole and Mr. Pulteney. At length the bill was read, and gave

ri&s;e to a very long and warm conte&s;t, in which the greate&s;t orators of both &s;ides found opportunities to di&s;play their eloquence and &s;atire. Mr. Pulteney defended the bill with all the ardour of paternal affe$tion; but, notwith&s;tand|ing his warme&s;t endeavours, it was rejected upon a divi&s;ion.</P>

<P>When the mutiny-bill was &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of lords, a long de|ba$e aro&s;e upon the number of troops voted for the $n&s;uing year. Lord Car|teret explained the &s;ituation of affairs in almo&s;t every nation of Europe, with great conci&s;ene&s;s and preci&s;ion. He demon&s;trated the improbability of a rup|ture between Great-Britain and any power, again&s;t which a land-army could be of any &s;ervice. He examined the dome&s;tic circum&s;tances of the nation; and proved, that whatever di&s;contents there might be in the kingdom, there was little or no di&s;affection, and no &s;eeming de&s;ign to overturn or di&s;turb the go|vernment. In an&s;wer to an argument that &s;uch a number of regular forces was nece&s;&s;ary for preventing or quelling $umults, and for enabling the civil magi$trate to execute the laws of his country, he expre&s;&s;ed his hope that he &s;ho$ld nev$r &s;ee the nation reduced to &s;uch unfortunate circum&s;tances: he &s;aid a law which the civil power was unable to execute, mu&s;t either be in it&s;elf op|pre&s;&s;ive, or &s;uch a one as afforded a handle for oppre&s;&s;ion. In arguing for a reduction of the forces, he took notice of the g$eat increa&s;e of the national expence. He ob&s;erved, that before the revolution, the people of England $id not rai&s;e above two millions for the whole of the public charge; but now what was called the current expence for which the parliament annually pro|vided, exceeded that &s;um, be&s;ides the civil li&s;t, the intere&s;t due to the public creditors, and the &s;inking-fund, which, added together, compo&s;ed a burthen of &s;ix millions yearly. The earl of Che&s;terfield on the &s;ame &s;ubject affirmed, that &s;lavery and arbitrary power were the certain con&s;equences of keeping up a &s;tanding army for any number of years. It is the machine by which the chains of &s;lavery are rivetted upon a free people. They may be &s;ecretly pre|pared by corruption; but, unle&s;s a &s;tanding army protected tho&s;e that forged them, the people would break them a&s;under, and chop off the polluted hands by which they were prepared. By degrees a free people mu&s;t be accu&s;tomed to be governed by an army: by degrees that army mu&s;t be made &s;trong enough to hold them in &s;ubjection. England had for many years been ac|cu&s;tomed to a &s;tanding army, under pretence of its being nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t the civil power; and by degrees the number and &s;trength of it have been in|crea&s;ing. At the acce&s;&s;ion of the late king it did not exceed &s;ix thou&s;and: it &s;oon amounted to double that number, which has been &s;ince augmented under various pretences. He therefore concluded, that &s;lavery, under the di&s;gui&s;e of an army for protecting the liberties of the people, was creeping in upon them by degrees: if no reduction &s;hould be made, he declared he &s;hould expect in a few years to hear &s;ome mini&s;ter, or favourite of a mini&s;ter, terrifying the hou&s;e with imaginary plots and inva&s;ions, and making the tour of Europe in &s;earch of po&s;&s;$b$e dangers, to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up a mercenary &s;tanding army three times as numerous as the pre&s;ent. In &s;pite of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, the &s;tanding army maintained its ground. The &s;ame noblemen, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by lord Ba$hur&s;t, di&s;tingui&s;hed them$elves in a debate upon the Spani&s;h depre|dations, which comprehended the &s;ame arguments that were u&s;$d in the hou&s;e of commons. They met with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s in both. Re&s;olutions equi|valent
<PB N="585" REF="5880">
to tho&s;e of the lower hou&s;e, were taken: an addre&s;s was pre&s;ented; and his maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ured them he would repeat, in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner, his in&s;tances at the court of Spain, in order to obtain &s;atisfaction and &s;ecurity for his &s;ubjects trading to America. This a&s;&s;urance was renewed in his &s;peech at the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, on the twentieth of May, when the parliament was prorogued.</P>

<P>At this period the prince&s;s of Wales was delivered of a &s;on, who was baptized by the name of George, now heir apparent to the crown. His birth was celebrated with uncommon rejoicings: addre&s;&s;es of congratulation were pre&s;ented to the king by the two univer&s;ities, and almo&s;t all the cities and communities of the kingdom. But the prince of Wales &s;till laboured under the di&s;plea&s;ure of his maje&s;ty, who had ordered the lord chamberlain to &s;ignify in the Gazette, that no per&s;on who vi&s;ited the prince &s;hould be admitted to the court of St. James's. His royal highne&s;s was dive&s;ted of all the external marks of royalty, and lived like a private gentleman, cultivating the virtues of a &s;ocial life, and enjoying the be&s;t fruits of conjugal felicity. In the latter end of this month, rear-admiral Haddock &s;et &s;ail with a &s;trong &s;quadron for the Mediterranean, which it was hoped would give weight to the negotiation of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter at the court of Madrid. The act to di&s;courage the re|tail of &s;pirituous liquors had incen&s;ed the populace to &s;uch a degree as oc|ca&s;ioned numberle&s;s tumults in the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. They were &s;o addicted to the u&s;e of that pernicious compound known by the ap|pellation of gin or ginievre, that they ran all ri&s;ques rather than forego it en|tirely; and &s;o little regard was payed to the law by which it was prohibited, that in le&s;s than two years twelve thou&s;and per&s;ons within the bills of mortality were convicted of having &s;old it illegally. Nearly one half of that number was ca&s;t in the penalty of one hundred pounds; and three thou&s;and per&s;ons payed ten pounds each, for an exemption from the di&s;grace of being com|mitted to the hou&s;e of correction.</P>

<P>The war maintained by the emperor and the czarina again&s;t the Ot|toman Porte had not yet produced any deci&s;ive event. Count Seckendorf was di&s;graced and confined, on account of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the la&s;t campaign. General Doxat was tried by a council of war at Belgrade, and condemned to death for having &s;urrendered to the enemy the town of Ni&s;&s;a, in which he com|manded. The diet of the empire granted a &s;ub&s;idy of fifty Roman months to the emperor, who began to make vigorous preparations for the en&s;uing campaign: but, in the mean time, Ragot&s;ki, vaivode of Tran&s;ylvania, re|volted again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and brought a con&s;iderable army into the field, under the protection of the grand &s;ignor. He was immediately pro|claimed a rebel, and a price &s;et upon his head by the court of Vienna. The Turks taking the field early, reduced the fort of U&s;itza, and Meadia, and undertook the &s;iege of Or&s;ova, which, however, they abandoned at the approach of the Imperial army, commanded by the grand duke of Tu&s;|cany, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by count Konig&s;egg. The Turks being reinforced, marched back and attacked the Imperiali&s;ts, by whom they were repul&s;ed after an ob&s;tinate engagement. The Germans, notwith&s;tanding this advantage, repa&s;&s;ed the Danube; and then the infidels made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Or&s;ova, where they found a fine train of artillery, de&s;igned for the &s;iege of
<PB N="586" REF="5890">
Widin. By the conque&s;t of this place, the Turks laid the Danube open to their gallies and ve&s;&s;els; and the Germans retired under the cannon of Bel|grade. In the Ukraine$ the Ru&s;&s;ians under general count Munich obtained the advantage over the Turks in two engagements; and general Lacy routed the Tartars of the Crimea: but they returned in greater numbers, and har|ra&s;&s;ed the Mu&s;covites in &s;uch a manner, by intercepting their provi&s;ions, and de&s;troying the country, that they were obliged to abandon the lines of Precops.</P>

<P>In the month of October, an affair of very &s;mall importance pro|duced a rupture between the king of Denmark and the elector of Hanover. A detachment of Ha$ overians took by a&s;&s;ault the ca&s;tle of Steinhor&s;t, belong|ing to the privy coun&s;ellor Wederkop, and defended by thirty Dani&s;h dra|goons, who had received orders to repel force by force. Several men were killed on both &s;ides, before the Hanoverians could enter the place, when the garri&s;on was di&s;armed and conducted to the frontiers. This petty di&s;pute, about a &s;mall territory which did not yield the value of one thou&s;and pounds a year, had well nigh involved Hanover in a wa$$ which, in all probability, Great-Britain mu&s;t have maintained: but this di&s;pute was compromi&s;ed by a con|vention between the kings of England and Denmark.</P>

<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was opened on the fir&s;t day of February, when the king, in his &s;peech to both hou&s;es, gave them to under&s;tand, that a convention was concluded and ratified between him and the king of Spain, who had obliged him&s;elf to make reparation to the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects for their lo&s;&s;es, by certain &s;tipulated payments: that plenipotentiaries were named and appointed for regulating, within a limited time, all tho&s;e grievances and abu&s;es which had hitherto interrupted the commerce of Great-Britain in the Ameri|can &s;eas; and for &s;ettling all matters in di&s;pute, in &s;uch a manner as might for the future prevent and remove all new cau&s;es and pretences of complaint. The motion for an addre&s;s of approbation was di&s;puted as u&s;ual. Though the convention was not yet layed before the hou&s;e, the nature of it was well known to the leaders of the oppo&s;ition. Sir William Wyndham ob&s;erved, that if the mini&s;try had made the re&s;olutions taken by the parliament in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion the foundation of their demands; if they had di&s;covered a re&s;olu|tion to break off all treating, rather than depart from the &s;en&s;e of parliament, either a defen&s;ive treaty might have been obtained, or by this time the wor&s;t would have been known: but, by what appeared from his maje&s;ty's &s;peech, the convention was no other than a preliminary; and, in all probability, a very bad preliminary. He &s;uppo&s;ed the mini&s;ter had ventured to clothe &s;ome of his creatures with full powers to give up the rights of the nation; for they might do it if they dur&s;t. Sir Robert Walpole, in an&s;wer to the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, affirmed, that the mini&s;try had on this occa&s;ion obtained more than ever on like occa&s;ions was known to be obtained: that they had reconciled the peace of their country with her true intere&s;t: that this peace was attended with all the advantage that the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful arms could have procured: that future ages would con&s;ider this as the mo&s;t glorious period of our hi&s;tory, and do ju&s;tice to the coun&s;els that produced the happy event, which every gentleman dive&s;ted of pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice was ready to do; and which, he believed, the pre&s;ent age, when rightly informed, would not refu&s;e. In a
<PB N="587" REF="5900">
word, he extolled his own convention with the mo&s;t extravagant enco|miums.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XIV.</HEAD>
<P>The hou&s;e re&s;olved to addre&s;s the king, that copies of all the memo|rials, repre&s;entations, letters, and papers, pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, or his &s;e|cretary of &s;tate, relating to depredations, &s;hould be &s;ubmitted to the peru&s;al of the hou&s;e: but &s;ome members in the oppo&s;ition were not contented with this re&s;olution. Then Mr. Sandys, who may be termed "the motion-maker," moved for an addre&s;s, de&s;iring that the hou&s;e might in&s;pect all letters written, and in&s;tructions given by the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, or commi&s;&s;ioners of the ad|miralty, to any of the Briti&s;h governors in America, or any commander in chief$ or captains of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war, or his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ter at the court of Spain, or any of his maje&s;ty's con&s;uls in Europe, &s;ince the treaty of Seville, relating to lo&s;&s;es which the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects had &s;u&s;tained by means of depreda|tions committed by the &s;ubjects of Spain in Europe and America. This was an unrea&s;onable propo&s;al &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;pirit of $$$mo&s;ity and faction. Mr. H. Walpole ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that a compliance with &s;uch an addre&s;s might lay open the mo&s;t private tran&s;actions of the cabinet, and di&s;cover &s;ecrets that ought, for the good of the kingdom, to be concealed. It would di&s;cover to the court of Spain, the ultimatum of the king's demands and conce&s;&s;ions, and the nation might thereby be deprived of many advantages which it might reap, were no &s;uch di&s;covery made. He &s;aid, that as &s;oon as the differences betwixt the two courts &s;hould arrive at &s;uch a cri&s;is, and not before, the con|&s;uls were in&s;tructed to give notice to the merchants, that they might retire in time with their effects; but, &s;hould &s;uch in&s;truction come to the knowledge of the Spaniards, it would be a kind of watch-word to put them on their guard, and unavoidably occa&s;ion the ruin of many thou&s;ands of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. Certain it is, no government could act either in external or dome&s;tic affairs with proper influence, dignity, and di&s;patch, if every letter and in&s;truction relating to an unfini&s;hed negotiation &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the view of &s;uch a numerous a&s;&s;embly, compo&s;ed of individuals actuated by motives in them|&s;elves diametrically oppo&s;ite. The motion being rejected by the majority, the &s;ame gentleman moved again for an addre&s;s, that his maje&s;ty would give di|rections for laying before the hou&s;e, copies of &s;uch memorials or repre&s;enta|tions as had been made, either to the king of Spain or to his mini&s;ters, &s;ince the treaty of Seville, relating to the depredations committed in Europe or America. A debate en&s;ued; and, upon a divi&s;ion, the que&s;tion pa&s;&s;ed in the negative.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XV.</HEAD>
<P>The hou&s;e, in a committee of &s;upply, voted twelve thou&s;and &s;ea|men for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year; and the &s;tanding army was continued without reduction, though powerfully attacked by the whole &s;trength of the oppo&s;ition. The commons likewi&s;e ordered an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, for the copies of &s;everal memorials &s;ince the treaty of Seville, touching the rights of Great-Britain, or any infraction of treaties which had not been layed before them. They were accordingly &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pecton of the hou&s;e. By this time the convention it&s;elf was not only pre&s;ented to the commons, but al&s;o publi&s;hed for the information of the people. Divers merchants, planters, and others, trading to America, the cities of London and Bri&s;tol, the merchants of Liver|pool, and the owners of &s;undry &s;hips which had been &s;eized by the Spaniards$
<PB N="588" REF="5910">
offered petitions again&s;t the convention, by which the &s;ubjects of Spain were &s;o far from giving up their groundle&s;s and unju&s;tifiable practice of vi&s;iting and &s;earching Briti&s;h &s;hips &s;ailing to and from the Briti&s;h plantations, that they appeared to have claimed the power of doing it as a right, by having in&s;i&s;ted that the differences which had ari&s;en concerning it &s;hould be referred to pleni|potentiaries, to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by them, without even agreeing to ab&s;tain from &s;uch vi&s;itation and &s;earch during the time that the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this affair might la&s;t. They therefore prayed, that they might have an opportunity of being heard, and allowed to repre&s;ent the great importance of the Briti&s;h trade to and from the plantations in America; the clear indi&s;putable right which they had to enjoy it, without being &s;topped, vi&s;ited, or &s;earched, by the Spaniards, on any pretence what&s;oever; and the certain inevitable de|&s;truction of all the riches and &s;trength derived to Great-Britain from that trade, if a &s;earch of Briti&s;h &s;hips &s;ailing to and from their own plantations, &s;hould be tolerated upon any pretext, or under any re&s;trictions, or even if the freedom of this navigation &s;hould continue much longer in a &s;tate of uncertainty. The&s;e petitions were referred to the committee appointed to con&s;ider of the convention. Another remon&s;trance was likewi&s;e pre&s;ented by the tru&s;tees for e&s;tablishing the colony of Georgia, &s;etting forth, that the king of Spain claimed that colony as part of his territories; and that by the convention the regulation of the limits of Carolina and Florida was referred to the determina|tion of plenipotentiaries; &s;o that the colony of Georgia, which undoubtedly belonged to the crown of Great-Britain, was left in di&s;pute, while the &s;ettlers remained in the mo&s;t precarious and dangerous &s;ituation. It was moved, that the merchants &s;hould be heard by their coun&s;el: but the propo&s;al was &s;tre|nuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the mini&s;try, and rejected upon a divi&s;ion.</P>

<P>This famous convention, concluded at the Pardo on the fourteenth day of January, imported, That within &s;ix weeks, to be reckoned from the day on which the ratifications were exchanged, two mini&s;ters plenipotentiaries &s;hould meet at Madrid, to confer and finally regulate the re&s;pective preten&s;ions of the two crowns, with relation to the trade and navigation in America and Europe, and to the limits of Florida and Carolina, as well as concerning other points which remained likewi&s;e to be adju&s;ted, according to the former treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two nations: that the plenipotentiaries &s;hould fini&s;h their confe|rences within the &s;pace of eight months: That in the mean time no progre&s;s &s;hould be made in the fortifications of Florida and Carolina: That his catholic maje&s;ty &s;hould pay to the king of Great-Britain the &s;um of ninety-five thou|&s;and pounds, for a balance due to the crown and &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, after deduction made of the demands of the crown and &s;ubjects of Spain: That this &s;um &s;hould be employed for the &s;atisfaction, di&s;charge, and payment of the demands of the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects upon the crown of Spain: That this reci|procal di&s;charge, however, &s;hould not extend or relate to the accounts and differences which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted and were to be &s;ettled between the crown of Spain and the a&s;&s;iento company, nor to any particular or private contracts that might &s;ub&s;i&s;t between either of the two crowns, or their mini&s;ters, with the &s;ubjects of the other; or between the &s;ubjects and &s;ubjects of each nation re&s;pectively: That his catholic maje&s;ty &s;hould cau&s;e the &s;um of ninety-five thou&s;and pounds to be payed at London within four months, to be reckoned from the day on
<PB N="589" REF="5920">
which the ratifications were exchanged. Such was the &s;ub&s;tance of that con|vention, which alarmed and provoked the merchants and traders of Great-Britain, excited the indignation of all tho&s;e who retained any regard for the honour of their country, and rai&s;ed a general cry again&s;t the mini&s;ter who &s;tood at the helm of admini&s;tration.</P>

<P>The eyes of the whole kingdom were now turned upon the hou&s;e of commons. The two contending parties &s;ummoned their whole force for the approaching di&s;pute; and on the day appointed for con&s;idering the conven|tion, four hundred members had taken their &s;eats by eight in the morning. In a committee of the whole hou&s;e, certain We&s;t-India merchants and planters were heard again&s;t the convention: &s;o that this and the following day were em|ployed in reading papers and obtaining information. On the eighth day of March Mr. H. Walpole having launched out in the prai&s;e of that agreement, moved for an addre&s;s of approbation to his maje&s;ty. He was &s;econded by Mr. Campbel of Pembroke&s;hire; and the debate began with extraordinary ardour. He that fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the li&s;ts was Sir Thomas Sander&s;on, at that time trea&s;urer to the prince of Wales, now earl of Scarborough. All the officers and adherents of his royal highne&s;s had joined the oppo&s;ition; and he him&s;elf on this occa&s;ion $at in the gallery, to hear the debate on &s;uch an impor|tant tran&s;action. Sir Thomas Sander&s;on ob&s;erved, that the Spaniards by the convention, in&s;tead of giving us reparation, had obliged us to give them a ge|neral relea&s;e. They had not allowed the word Satisfaction to be &s;o much as once mentioned in the treaty. Even the Spani&s;h pyrate who had cut off the ear of captain Jenkins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Jenkins was ma&s;ter of a Scotti&s;h merchant &s;hip. He was boarded by the captain of a Spani&s;h guarda co&s;ta, who treated him in the mo&s;t barbarous manner. The Spaniards, after having rummaged his ve&s;&s;el for what they call contraband commodities, without finding any thing to ju&s;tify their &s;earch, in&s;ulted Jenkins with the mo&s;t opprobrious invectives; they tore off one of his ears, bidding him carry it to his king, and tell him, they would &s;erve him in the &s;ame manner &s;hould an opportunity offer: they tortured him with the mo&s;t &s;hocking cruelty, and threatened him with immediate death. This man was examined at the bar of the hou&s;e of commons, and being a&s;ked by a member, what he thought when he found him&s;elf in the hands of &s;uch barbarians? <Q>&startq;I recommended my &s;oul to God (&s;aid he) and my cau&s;e to my country.&endq;</Q> The behaviour of this brave &s;eaman, the &s;ight of his ear, which was produced, with his account of the indignities which had been offered to the na|tion and &s;overeign of Great-Britain, filled the whole hou&s;e with indignation. Jenkins was after|wards employed in the &s;ervice of the Ea&s;t-India company: he approved him&s;elf worthy of his good fortune, in a long engagement with the pyrate Angria, during which he behaved with extraordinary courage and conduct; and &s;aved his own &s;hip with three others that were under his convoy.</NOTE>, and u&s;ed the mo&s;t in&s;ulting expre&s;&s;ion towards the per&s;on of the king; an expre&s;&s;ion which no Briti&s;h &s;ubject could decently re|peat; an expre&s;&s;ion which no man that had a regard for his &s;overeign could ever forgive; even this fellow lived to enjoy the fruits of his rapine, and re|mained a living te&s;timony of the cowardly tamene&s;s and mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Great-Britain; of the triumphant haughtine&s;s, and &s;tubborn pride of Spain. Lord Gage, one of the mo&s;t keen, &s;pirited, and &s;arca&s;tic orators in the hou&s;e, &s;tated in his manner the account of the &s;atisfaction obtained from the court of Spain by the convention. The lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the Spani&s;h depredations amounted to three hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds. The commi&s;&s;ary, by a &s;troke of his pen, reduced this demand to two hundred thou&s;and pounds; then forty-five thou&s;and were &s;truck off for prompt payment. He next alot|ted
<PB N="590" REF="5930">
&s;ixty thou&s;and pounds as the remaining part of a debt pretended to be due to Spain, for the de&s;truction of her fleet by Sir George Byng, though it appeared by the in&s;tructions on the table, that Spain had been already amply &s;atisfied on that head. The&s;e deductions reduced the ballance to ninety-five thou&s;and pounds; but the king of Spain in&s;i&s;ted upon the South-&s;ea company's paying immediately the &s;um of &s;ixty-eight thou&s;and pounds, as a debt due to him on one head of accounts, though in other articles his catholic maje&s;ty was in|debted to the company a million over and above this demand. The remainder to be payed by Spain did not exceed &s;even and twenty thou&s;and pounds, from which &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon deducting whatever &s;he might have already given in &s;atisfac|tion for any of the Briti&s;h &s;hips that had been taken; and on being allowed the value of the St. There&s;a, a Spani&s;h &s;hip which had been &s;eized in the port of Dublin. Mr W. Pitt, with an energy of argument and diction peculiar to him&s;elf, declaimed again&s;t the convention, as in&s;ecure, un&s;atisfactory, and di&s;|honourable to Great-Britain. He &s;aid, the great national objection, the &s;earch|ing of Briti&s;h &s;hips, was not omitted, indeed, in the preamble; but &s;tood there as the reproach of the whole, as the &s;tronge&s;t evidence of the fatal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that followed: on the part of Spain, an u&s;urpation, an inhuman tyranny claimed and exerci&s;ed over the American &s;eas: on the part of England, an undoubted right by treaties, and from God and nature declared and a&s;&s;erted in the re&s;olu|tions of parliament, were now referred to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of plenipotentiaries, upon one and the &s;ame equal foot. This undoubted right was to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and regulated; and if to regulate be to pre&s;cribe rules, as in all con&s;truction it is, that right was by the expre&s;s words of the convention, to be given up and &s;a|crificed; for, it mu&s;t cea&s;e to be any thing from the moment it is &s;ubmitted to limitation. Mr. Lyttleton, with equal force and fluency, an&s;wered the &s;peech of Mr. H. Walpole. <Q>&startq;After he had u&s;ed many arguments to per&s;uade us to peace, (&s;aid he) to any peace, good or bad, by pointing out the dangers of a war, dangers I by no means allow to be &s;uch as he repre&s;ents them, he crown|ed all tho&s;e terrors with the name of the pretender. It would be the cau&s;e of the pretender. The pretender would come. Is the honourable gentle|man &s;en&s;ible what this language imports? The people of England complain of the greate&s;t wrongs and indignities: they complain of the interruption, the de&s;truction of their trade: they think this peace has left them in a wor&s;e condition than before; and in an&s;wer to all the&s;e complaints, what are they told? Why, that their continuing to &s;uffer all this, is the price they mu&s;t pay to keep the king and his family on the throne of the&s;e realms. If this were true, it ought not to be owned; but it is far from truth: the very rever&s;e is true. Nothing can weaken the family; nothing &s;hake the e&s;tabli&s;hment, but &s;uch mea&s;ures as the&s;e, and &s;uch language as this.&endq;</Q> He affirmed, that if the mini&s;ters had proceeded conformably to the intentions of parliament, they would either have acted with vigour, or have obtained a real &s;ecurity in an ex|pre&s;s acknowledgment of our right not to be &s;earched, as a preliminary, fine qua non, to our treating at all. In&s;tead of this they had referred it to plenipoten|tiaries. <Q>&startq;Would you, Sir, (&s;aid he) &s;ubmit to a r$fer$nce, wheth$r you may travel unmole&s;ted from your hou&s;e in town to your hou&s;e in the country? Your right is clear and undeniable, why would you have it di&s;cu&s;&s;ed? but much le&s;s wo$$$ you refer it, if two of your judges belonged to a gang which has often
<PB N="591" REF="5940">
&s;topped and robbed you in your way thither, before.&endq;</Q> The mini&s;ters, in vindication of the convention, a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;atisfaction granted by Spain was adequate to the injury received: that it was only the preliminary of a treaty that would remove all cau&s;es of complaint: that war was always expen&s;ive and detrimental to a trading nation, as well as uncertain in its events: that France and Spain would certainly join their forces in ca&s;e of a rupture with Great-Britain: that there was not one power in Europe upon which the Engli&s;h could depend for effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and, that war would favour the cau&s;e and de|&s;igns of a popi&s;h pretender. The hou&s;e, upon a divi&s;ion, agreed to the addre&s;s; but, when a motion was made for its being recommitted, the two parties re|newed the engagement with redoubled eagerne&s;s and impetuo&s;ity. Sir William Wyndham and Mr. Pulteney poured all the thunder of their eloquence again&s;t the in&s;olence of Spain, and the conce&s;&s;ions of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try. Sir Robert Walpole exerted all his fortitude and dexterity in defence of him&s;elf and his mea&s;ures; and the que&s;tion being put, the re&s;olutions for the addre&s;s were carried by a &s;mall majority.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Then Sir William Wyndham &s;tanding up, made a pathetic re|mon&s;trance upon this determination. <Q>&startq;This addre&s;s (&s;aid he) is intended to convince mankind, that the treaty under our con&s;ideration is a rea&s;onable and an honourable treaty. But if a majority of twenty-eight in &s;uch a full hou&s;e &s;hould fail of that &s;ucce&s;s; if the people &s;hould not implicitly re&s;ign their rea&s;on to a vote of this hou&s;e, what will be the con&s;equence? will not the parliament lo&s;e its authority? will it not be thought, that even in the parlia|ment we are governed by a faction? and what the con&s;equence of this may be, I leave to tho&s;e gentlemen to con&s;ider, who are now to give their vote for this addre&s;s; for my own part, I will trouble you no more; but, with the&s;e my la&s;t words, I &s;incerely pray to Almighty God, who has &s;o often won|derfully protected the&s;e kingdoms, that he will graciou&s;ly continue his pro|tection over them, by pre&s;erving us from that impending danger which threatens the nation from without, and likewi&s;e from that impending danger which threatens our con&s;titution from within.&endq;</Q> The mini&s;ter was on this occa&s;ion de&s;erted by his u&s;ual temper, and even provoked into per&s;onal abu&s;e. He declared, that the gentleman who was now the mouth of his opponents, had been looked upon as the head of tho&s;e traitors who twenty-five years be|fore con&s;pired the de&s;truction of their country, and of the royal family, in order to &s;et a popi&s;h pretender upon the throne: that he was &s;eized by the vigilance of the then government, and pardoned by its clemency; but all the u&s;e he had ungratefully made of that clemency was to qualify him&s;elf according to law, that he and his party might &s;ome time or other have an opportunity to overthrow all law. He branded them all as traitors, and expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that their behaviour would unite all the true friends of the pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment. To &s;uch a degree of mutual animo&s;ity were both &s;ides inflamed, that the mo&s;t eminent members of the minority actually retired from parliament; and were by the nation in general re$ered as martyrs to the liberty of the people.</P>

<P>The di&s;pute occa&s;ioned by the convention in the hou&s;e of lords was maintained with equal warmth, and perhaps with more abilities. After this famous treaty had been con&s;idered, lord Carteret &s;ugge&s;ted, that po&s;&s;ibly one of the contracting powers had pre&s;ented a prote&s;t or declaration, importing,
<PB N="592" REF="5950">
that &s;he acceded to &s;uch or &s;uch a mea&s;ure, only upon condition, that the terms of that prote&s;t or declaration &s;hould be made good. He &s;aid, that until his mind &s;hould be free from the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;u&s;picion that &s;uch a paper might exi&s;t in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, he could not form a ju&s;t opinion of the tran&s;action him&s;elf, nor communicate to their lord&s;hips any light which might be nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e. The adherents to the mini&s;try endeavoured to evade his cu|rio&s;ity in this particular, by general a&s;&s;ertions; but he in&s;i&s;ted on his &s;u&s;picion with &s;uch per&s;everance, that at length the mini&s;try produced the copy of a de|claration made by the king of Spain before he ratified the convention, &s;ignify|ing, That his catholic maje&s;ty re&s;erved to him&s;elf, in its full force, the right of being able to &s;u&s;pend the a&s;&s;iento of negroes, in ca&s;e the company &s;hould not pay within a &s;hort time the &s;um of &s;ixty eight thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, owing to Spain on the duty of negroes, or on the profit of the &s;hip Caroline: That under the validity and force of this prote&s;t, the &s;igning of the &s;aid con|vention might be proceeded on, and in no other manner. In the debate that en|&s;ued, lord Carteret di&s;played a &s;urpri&s;ing extent of political knowledge, recom|mended by all the graces of elocution, cha&s;te, pure, dignified, and delicate. Lord Bathur&s;t argued again&s;t the articles of convention with his u&s;ual &s;pirit, integrity, and good &s;en&s;e, particularly animated by an hone&s;t indignation which the wrongs of his country had in&s;pired. The earl of Che&s;terfield attacked this inglorious mea&s;ure with all the weight of argument, and all the poignancy of &s;atire. The duke of Argyle, no longer a parti&s;an of the mini&s;try, inv ighed again&s;t it as infamous, treacherous, and de&s;tructive, with all the fire, impetuo|&s;ity, and enthu&s;ia&s;m of declamation. It was defended with unequal arms by the duke of Newca&s;tle, the earl of Cholmondley, the lord Hervey, the lord chancellor, the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, and in particular by the earl of Ilay, a no|bleman of exten&s;ive capacity and uncommon erudition; remarkable for his knowledge of the civil law; and &s;eemingly formed by nature for a politician; cool, di&s;cerning, plau&s;ible, artful, and enterpri&s;ing; &s;taunch to the mini&s;ter, and invariably true to his own intere&s;t. The di&s;pute was learned, long, and ob&s;ti|nate; but ended as u&s;ual in the di&s;comfiture of tho&s;e who had &s;tigmatized the treaty. The hou&s;e agreed to an addre&s;s, in which they thanked his maje&s;ty for his gracious conde&s;cen&s;ion in laying before them the conven|tion. They acknowledged his great prudence in bringing the demands of his &s;ubjects for their pa&s;t lo&s;&s;es, which had been &s;o long depending, to a final adju&s;tment; in procuring an expre&s;s &s;tipulation for a &s;peedy payment; and in laying a foundation for accompli&s;hing the great and de&s;irable ends of obtaining future &s;ecurity, and pre&s;erving the peace between the two nations. They declared their confidence in his royal wi&s;dom, that in the treaty to be concluded in pur&s;uance of the convention, proper provi&s;ions would be made for the redre&s;s of the grievances of which the nation had &s;o ju&s;tly complained: They a&s;&s;ured his maje&s;ty, that in ca&s;e his ju&s;t expectations &s;hould not be an|&s;wered, the hou&s;e would heartily and zealou&s;ly concur in all &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate his maje&s;ty's honour, and to pre&s;erve to his &s;ubjects the full enjoyment of all tho&s;e rights to which they were intituled by treaty and the law of nations. This was a hard-won victory. At the head of tho&s;e who voted again&s;t the addre&s;s we find the prince of Wales. His example was followed by &s;ix dukes, two and twenty earls, four vi&s;counts, eighteen ba|rons,
<PB N="593" REF="5960">
four bi&s;hops; and their party was reinforced by &s;ixteen proxies. A &s;pi|rited<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 17$9.</NOTE> prote&s;t was entered and &s;ub&s;cribed by nine and thirty peers, comprehend|ing all the noblemen of the kingdom who were mo&s;t eminent for their talents, integrity, and virtue.</P>

<DIV4 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XX.</HEAD>
<P>A me&s;&s;age having been delivered to the hou&s;e from his maje&s;ty, im|porting$ That he had &s;ettled nine and thirty thou&s;and pounds per annum on the younger children of the royal family; and de&s;iring their lord&s;hips would bring in a bill to enable his maje&s;ty to make that provi&s;ion good, out of the hereditary revenues of the crown; &s;ome lords in the oppo&s;ition ob&s;erved, that the next heir to the crown might look upon this &s;ettlement as a mortgage of his revenue, which a parliament had no power to make: that formerly no daughter of the royal family was ever provided for by parliament, except the elde&s;t, and that never was by way of annuity, but an expre&s;s provi&s;ion of a determinate &s;um of money payed by way of dowry. The objections were over-ruled; and the hou&s;e complied with his maje&s;ty's reque&s;t. Then the duke of Newca&s;tle pro|duced a &s;ub&s;idy-treaty, by which his maje&s;ty obliged him&s;elf to pay to the king of Denmark &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds per annum, on condition of furni&s;hing to his Britannic maje&s;ty a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men, when demanded. At the &s;ame time his grace delivered a me&s;&s;age from the king, de&s;iring the hou&s;e would enable him to fulfil this engagement; and al&s;o to rai&s;e what mone$ and troops the exigency of affairs, during the approaching rece&s;s, might require. Another vehement di&s;pute aro&s;e from this propo&s;al. With re&s;pect to the treaty, lord Carteret ob&s;erved, that no u&s;e could be made of the Dani&s;h troops in any ex|pedition undertaken again&s;t Spain, becau&s;e it was &s;tipulated in the treaty, that they &s;hould not be u&s;ed either in Italy or on board of the fleet, or be tran&s;ported in whole or in part beyond &s;ea, after they &s;hould have marched out of the ter|ritories of Denmark, except for the defence of the kingdoms of Great-Britain and Ireland; nay, &s;hould France join again&s;t the Engli&s;h, the Danes could not act again&s;t that power or Spain, except as part of an army formed in Germany or Flanders. This body of Danes may be &s;aid, therefore, to have been retained for the defence and protection of Hanover: or, if the intere&s;t of Britain was at all con&s;ulted in the treaty, it mu&s;t have been in preventing the Danes from joining their fleets to tho&s;e of France and Spain. Then he argued again&s;t the &s;econd part of the me&s;&s;age with great vivacity. He &s;aid, nothing could be more dan|gerous to the con&s;titution than a general and unlimited vote of credit. Such a demand our ance&s;tors would have heard with amazement, and rejected with &s;corn. He affirmed, that the practice was but of modern date in England: that it was never heard of before the revolution; and never became frequent until the nation was ble&s;&s;ed with the pre&s;ent wi&s;e admini&s;tration. He &s;aid, if ever a general vote of credit and confidence &s;hould become a cu&s;tomary com|pliment from the parliament to the crown at the end of every &s;e&s;&s;ion, or as often as the mini&s;ter might think fit to de&s;ire it, parliaments would grow de&s;pi|cable in the eye$ of the people; then a proclamation might be ea&s;ily &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead, and happy would it be for the nation if that &s;hould be &s;ufficient; for when a parliament cea&s;es to be a check upon mini&s;ters, it becomes an u&s;ele&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary burden on the people. The repre&s;entatives mu&s;t always be payed &s;ome way or other; if their wages are not payed openly and &s;urely by their re&s;pective con&s;tituents, as they were $ormerly, a majority of them, m$y in fu|ture
<PB N="594" REF="5970">
times be always ready to accept of wages from the admini&s;tration, and the&s;e mu&s;t come out of the pockets of the people. The duke of Argyle and the earl of Che&s;terfield enlarged upon the &s;ame topics. Neverthele&s;s, the hou&s;e complied with the me&s;&s;age$ and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, in which they not only ap|proved of the treaty with Denmark, but likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured him they would con|cur with his mea&s;ures, and &s;upport him in fulfilling his engagements, as well as in making &s;uch further augmentation of his forces by &s;ea and land, as he &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary for the honour, inter$&s;t, and &s;afety of the&s;e kingdoms.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXI.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ame me&s;&s;age being communicated to the commons, they voted &s;eventy thou&s;and five hundred and eighty-three pounds for the &s;ub&s;idy to Denmark, and five hundred thou&s;and pounds for augmenting the forces on any emergency. As Great-Britain &s;tood engaged by the convention to pay to the crown of Spain the &s;um of &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, in con&s;ideration of the &s;hips taken and de&s;troyed by Sir George Byng$ which &s;um was to be applied to the relief of the Briti&s;h merchants who had &s;uffered by the Spani&s;h depredations, the commons in&s;erted in a bill a clau&s;e, providing for this &s;um to be payed by the parliament. When the bill was read in the hou&s;e of lords, a motion was made by lord Bathur&s;t for an addre&s;s, to know, whether Spain had payed the money &s;t$pulated by the convention, as the time limited for the payment of it was now expired? The duke of Newca&s;tle, by his maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion, ac|quainted the hou&s;e, that it was not payed; and, that Spain had as yet given no rea&s;on for the non-payment. Then a day was appointed to con&s;ider the &s;tate of the nation, when lord Carter$t moved for a re&s;olution, that the failure of Spain in this particular was a breach of the convention, an high indignity to his maje&s;ty, and an in$u&s;tice to the nation. But, after a warm debate, this mo|tion was over-ruled by the majority. The mini&s;ter, in order to atone in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the unpopular &s;tep he had taken in the convention, allowed a &s;alu|tary law to pa&s;s for the encouragement of the woollen manufacture; and two bills in behalf of the &s;ugar colonies, one permitting them, for a limited time, to export their produce directly to foreign parts, under proper re&s;trictions, and the other making more effectual provi&s;ions for &s;ecuring the duties layed upon the importation of foreign &s;$gars, rum, and mola&s;&s;es into Great-Britain, and his maje&s;ty's plantations in America. The &s;upplies being voted, the funds e&s;ta|b$$$he$, and the crown gratified in every particular, the king clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech on the fourteenth day of June, when the chancellor, in his ma|je&s;ty's name$ prorogued the parliament <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Among the laws e$$$ted in the cour&s;e of this $word$ was an act again&s;t g$m$n$$ $word$ had be|c$me $span$ all $span$ and li$e$$ to pr$ve $word$ of all $word$ indu$$r$, and &s;entim$$t.

<P>Letters of marque and repri&s;al were granted again&s;t the Spaniards; a promotion was made of general-officers; the troops were augmented; a
<PB N="595" REF="5980">
great fleet was a&s;&s;embled at Spithead; a reinforcement &s;ent out to admiral Haddock; and an embargo layed on all merchant &s;hips outward bound. Not|with&s;tanding the&s;e preparations of war, Mr. Keen, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter at Ma|drid, declared to the court of Spain, that his ma&s;ter, although he had permitted his &s;ubjects to make repri&s;als, would not be under&s;tood to have broken the peace; and, that this permi&s;&s;ion would be recalled as &s;oon as his catholic maje&s;ty &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to make the &s;atisfaction which had been &s;o ju&s;tly demanded. He was given to under&s;tand, that the king of Spain looked upon tho&s;e repri|&s;als as acts of ho&s;tility; and that he hoped, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of heaven and his allies, he &s;hould be able to &s;upport a good cau&s;e again&s;t his adver&s;aries. He publi&s;hed a manife&s;to in ju&s;tification of his own conduct, complaining, that ad|miral Haddock had received orders to crui&s;e with his &s;quadron between the capes St. Vincent and St. Mary, in order to &s;urpri&s;e the a&s;&s;ogue &s;hips; that letters of repri&s;al had been publi&s;hed at London, in an indecent &s;tyle, and even carried into execution in different parts of the world. He excu&s;ed his non-payment of the ninety-five thou&s;and pounds &s;tipulated in the convention, by affirming, that the Briti&s;h court had fir&s;t contravened the articles of that treaty, by the orders &s;ent to Haddock; by continuing to fortify Georgia; by reinforc|ing the &s;quadron at Jamaica; and by eluding the payment of the &s;ixty-eight thou&s;and pounds due to Spain from the South-&s;ea company, on the a&s;&s;iento for negroes. The French amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague declared, that the king his ma&s;ter was obliged by treaties to a&s;&s;i&s;t his catholic maje&s;ty by &s;ea and land, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be attacked: he di&s;&s;uaded the &s;tates-general from e&s;pou&s;ing the quarrel of Great-Britain; and they a&s;&s;ured him they would ob&s;erve a &s;trict neu|trality, though they could not avoid furni&s;hing his Britannic maje&s;ty with &s;uch &s;uccours as he could demand, by virtue of the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two powers. The people of England were in&s;pired with uncommon alacrity at the near pro&s;pect of war, for which they had &s;o long clamoured; and the mini&s;try &s;eeing it unavoidable, began to be earne&s;t and effectual in their preparations.</P>

<P>The events of war were &s;till unfavourable to the emperor. He had be&s;towed the command of his army upon velt marechal count Wallis, who a&s;&s;embled his forces in the neighbourhood of Belgrade, and advanced towards Crot&s;ka, where he was attacked by the Turks with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity and per&s;eve|rance, that he was obliged to give ground, after a long and ob&s;tinate engage|ment, in which he lo&s;t above &s;ix thou&s;and men. The earl of Crawford, who &s;erved as a volunteer in the Imperial army, &s;ignalized his courage in an ex|traordinary manner on this occa&s;ion, and received a dangerous wound, of which he never perfectly recovered. The Turks were afterwards wor&s;ted at Jabouka: neverthele&s;s, their grand army inve&s;ted Belgrade on the &s;ide of Servia, and car|ried on the operations of the &s;iege with extraordinary vigour. The emperor dreading the lo&s;s of this place, &s;eeing his finances exhau&s;ted, and his army con|&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, con&s;ented to a negotiatiation for peace, which was tran&s;|acted under the mediation of the French amba&s;&s;ador at the Ottoman Porte. The count de Neuperg, as Imperial plenipotentiary, &s;igned the preliminaries on the fir&s;t day of September. They were ratified by the emperor, though he pre|tended to be di&s;&s;atisfied with the articles; and declared, that his mini&s;ter had

exceeded his $word$ By this treaty the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria coded to the grand $span$ Au&s;trian Walach$a, the i&s;le and fortre&s;s of $span$ of St. Elizabeth; and the contracting powers agreed, that the $span$ &s;hould &s;erve as boundaries to the two empires. The $word$ publi&s;hed a circular $word$ addre&s;&s;ed to his mini&s;ters at all the courts in $span$ for the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the la&s;t campaign, and $span$ the $span$ of count Ne$perg; my, the&s;e two officers were actually $word$ and confined in $span$ however, was no other than a &s;acrifice to the re&s;entment of the $word$ who $$udly complained, that $span$ concluded a &s;eparate peace, contrary to his engagements with the Ru&s;&s;ian empire.

The czarina finding hi$&s;elf abandoned by the emperor, and unable to $word$ with the whole power of the Ottoman empire, took the fir&s;t opportunity of putting an end to the war upon honourable terms. After a &s;hort negotiation the conferences ended in a treaty, by which &s;he was left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of A&s;oph, on condition that its fortifications &s;hould be demo|li&s;hed; and the antient limits were re-e&s;tabli&s;hed between the two empires.</P>

<P>A rupture between Great-Britain and Spain was now become inevi|table. The Engli&s;h &s;quadron in the Mediterranean had already made prize of two rich Caracca &s;hips. The king had i&s;&s;ued orders for augmenting his land|forces, and rai&s;ing a body of marines: and a great number of &s;hips of war were put in commi&s;&s;ion. Admiral Vernon had been &s;ent to the We&s;t-Indies, to a&s;&s;ume the command of the &s;quadron in tho&s;e &s;eas; and to annoy the trade and &s;ettlements of the Spaniards. This gentleman had rendered him&s;elf con|&s;iderable in the hou&s;e of commons, by loudly condemning all the mea|&s;ures of the mini&s;try, and bluntly &s;peaking his &s;entiments, whatever they were, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, and &s;ometimes without any regard to decorum. He was counted a good officer, and this boi&s;terous manner &s;eemed to inhance his cha|racter. As he had once commanded a &s;quadron in Jamaica, he was perfectly well acquainted with tho&s;e &s;eas; and in a debate upon the Spani&s;h depredations, he chanced to affirm, that Porto-Bello on the Spani&s;h main might be ea&s;ily taken: nay, he even undertook to reduce it with &s;ix &s;hips only. This offer was ecchoed from the mouths of all the members in the oppo&s;ition. Vernon was extolled as another Drake or Raleigh: he became the idol of a party, and his prai&s;e re&s;ounded from all corners of the kingdom. The mini&s;ter, in order to appea&s;e the clamours of the people on this &s;ubject, &s;ent him as commander in chief to the We&s;t-Indies. He was plea&s;ed with an opportunity to remove &s;uch a trou|ble&s;ome cen&s;or from the hou&s;e of commons; and perhaps, he was not without hope, that Vernon would di&s;grace him&s;elf and his party, by failing in the ex|ploit he had undertaken. His catholic maje&s;ty having ordered all the Briti&s;h &s;hips in his horbours to be &s;eized and detained, the king of England would keep mea&s;ures with him no longer, but denounced war again&s;t him on the twenty-third day of October. Many Engli&s;h merchants began to equip priva|teers, and arm their trading ve&s;&s;els, to protect their own commerce as well as
<PB N="597" REF="6000">
to di&s;tre&s;s that of the enemy. The &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was opened in Novem|ber, when the king in his &s;peech to both hou&s;es declared, that he had aug|mented his &s;orces by &s;ea and land, pur&s;uant to the power ve&s;ted in him by par|liament for the &s;ecurity of his dominions, the protection of trade, and the an|noyance of the enemy; and, he expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion, that the heats and animo&s;ities which had been indu&s;triou&s;ly fomented throughout the kingdom, encouraged Spain to act in &s;uch a manner as rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for him to have recour&s;e to arms. In an&s;wer to this &s;peech, affectionate addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented by both hou&s;es, without any con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>The &s;eceding members had again re&s;umed their &s;eats in the hou&s;e of commons; and Mr. Pulteney thought proper to vindicate the extraordinary &s;tep which they had taken. He &s;aid, they thought it was nece&s;&s;ary, as affairs then &s;tood, for clearing their characters to po&s;terity from the imputation of &s;it|ting in an a&s;&s;embly where a determined majority gave a &s;anction to mea&s;ures evidently to the di&s;grace of his maje&s;ty and the nation. He ob&s;erved, that their conduct was &s;o fully ju&s;tified by the declaration of war again&s;t Spain, that any further vindication would be &s;uperfluous; for every a&s;&s;ertion contained in it had been almo&s;t in the &s;ame words in&s;i&s;ted upon by tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the conven|tion: <Q>&startq;Every &s;entence in it (added he) is an echo of what was &s;aid in our rea|&s;onings again&s;t that treaty: every po&s;itive truth which the declaration lays down, was denied with the utmo&s;t confidence by tho&s;e who &s;poke for the convention; and, &s;ince that time, there has not one event happened which was not then fore&s;een and foretold.&endq;</Q> He propo&s;ed, that in maintaining the war the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in the We&s;t-Indies &s;hould be attacked; and, that the mini&s;try &s;hould not have the power to give up the conque&s;ts that might be made. He &s;aid, he heartily wi&s;hed for his maje&s;ty's honour and &s;ervice, that no mention had been made of heats and animo&s;ities in the king's &s;peech; and gave it as his opinion, that they &s;hould take no notice of that clau&s;e in their addre&s;s. He was an&s;wered by Sir Robert Walpole, who took occa&s;ion to &s;ay, he was in no great concern le&s;t the &s;ervice of his maje&s;|ty or the nation &s;hould &s;uffer by the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e members who had quitted the hou&s;e: he affirmed, the nation was generally &s;en&s;ible, that the many u&s;eful and popular acts which pa&s;&s;ed towards the end of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, were greatly forwarded and facilitated by the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e gentlemen; and, if they were returned only to oppo&s;e and perplex, he &s;hould not be at all &s;orry to &s;ee them &s;ecede again.</P>

<P>Mr. Pulteney revived the bill which he had formerly prepared for the encouragement of &s;eamen. After a long di&s;pute, and eager oppo&s;ition by the mini&s;try, it pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es, and obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent. Mr. Sandys having ob&s;erved, that there could be no immediate u&s;e for a great number of forces in the kingdom; and explained how little &s;ervice could be expected from raw and undi&s;ciplined men, propo&s;ed an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring, that the body of marines &s;hould be compo&s;ed of draughts from the old regiments: that as few officers &s;hould be appointed as the nature of the ca&s;e would permit; and he expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that the hou&s;e would recommend this method to his maje&s;ty, in tender compa&s;&s;ion to his people, already burthened with many heavy and grievous taxes. This &s;cheme was repugnant to the intention of the mi|ni&s;try,
<PB N="5$8" REF="6010">
who&s;e aim was to increa&s;e the number of their dependants, and extend their parliamentary intere&s;t by granting a great number of commi&s;&s;ions. The motion was therefore, after a long debate, rejected by the majority. Motions were made for an inquiry into the conduct of tho&s;e who concluded the conven|tion; but, they were over-ruled. The pen&s;ion-bill was revived, and &s;o power|fully &s;upported by the eloquence of Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Pulteney, and Mr. Lyttleton, that it made its way through the commons to the upper hou&s;e, where it was again lo&s;t, upon a divi&s;ion, after a very long debate. As the &s;ea|men of the kingdom expre&s;&s;ed uncommon aver&s;ion to the &s;ervice of the go|vernment, and the fleet could not be manned without great difficulty, the mi|ni&s;try prepared a bill, which was brought in by Sir Charles Wager, for regi&s;ter|ing all &s;eamen, watermen, fi&s;hermen, and lightermen throughout his maje&s;ty's do|minions. Had this bill pa&s;&s;ed into a law, a Briti&s;h &s;ailor would have been reduced to the mo&s;t object degree of &s;lavery: had he removed from a certain di&s;trict allotted for the place of his re&s;idence, he would have been deemed a de&s;erter, and puni&s;hed accordingly: he mu&s;t have appeared, when &s;ummoned, at all ha|zards, whatever might have been the circum&s;tances of his family, or the &s;tate of his private affairs: had he been incumbered with debt, he mu&s;t either have incurred the penalties of this law, or lain at the mercy of his creditors: had he acquired by indu&s;try, or received by inheritance, an ample fortune, he would have been liable to be torn from his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;ubjected to hard&s;hips which no man would endure but from the &s;en&s;e of fear or indigence. The bill was &s;o vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Sir John Barnard and others, as a flagrant in|croachment on the liberties of the people, that the hou&s;e rejected it on the &s;e|cond reading.</P>

<P>The king having by me&s;&s;age communicated to the hou&s;e his in|tention of di&s;po&s;ing the prince&s;s Mary in marriage to prince Frederick of He&s;&s;e; and expre&s;&s;ing his hope, that the commons would enable him to give a &s;uitable portion to his daughter; they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to grant forty thou&s;and pounds for that purpo&s;e; and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s of thanks to his maje&s;ty, for having communicated to the hou&s;e this intended marriage. On the thirteenth day of March a &s;hip arrived from the We&s;t-Indies, di&s;patched by admiral Vernon, with an account of his having taken Porto-Bello, on the i&s;thmus of Darien, with &s;ix &s;hips only, and demoli&s;hed all the fortifications of the place. The Spaniards acted with &s;uch pu&s;illanimity on this occa&s;ion, that their forts were taken almo&s;t without blood&s;hed. The two hou&s;es of parliament joined in an addre&s;s of congratulation upon this &s;ucce&s;s of his maje&s;ty's arms; and the nation in general was wonderfully elated by an exploit which was magnified much above its merit. The commons granted every thing the crown thought proper to demand. They provided for eight and twenty thou&s;and land-forces, be&s;ides &s;ix thou&s;and marines. They enabled his maje&s;ty to equip a very power|ful navy: they voted the &s;ub&s;idy to the king of Denmark; and they im|powered their &s;overeign to defray certain extraordinary expences not &s;pecified in the e&s;timates. To an&s;wer the&s;e uncommon grants, they impo&s;ed a land-tax of four &s;hillings in the pound; and enabled his maje&s;ty to deduct twelve hun|dred thou&s;and pounds from the &s;inking fund: in a word, the expence of the war, during the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing year, amounted to about four millions.

<P>During the greate&s;t part of this winter, the poor had been griev|ou&s;ly afflicted in con&s;equence of a &s;evere fro&s;t, which began at Chri&s;tmas and continued till the latter end of February. The river Thames was covered with &s;uch a cru&s;t of ice, that a multitude of people dwelled upon it in tents, and a great number of booths were erected for the entertainment of the popu|lace. The navigation was entirely &s;topped: the watermen and fi&s;hermen were di&s;abled from earning a livelihood: the fruits of the earth were de&s;troyed by the cold, which was &s;o extreme, that many per&s;ons were chilled to death; and this calamity was the more deeply felt, as the poor could not afford to &s;upply them&s;elves with coals and fuel, which were advanced in price in pro|portion to the &s;everity and continuance of the fro&s;t. The lower cla&s;s of la|bourers, who worked in the open air, were now deprived of all means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence: many kinds of manufacture were layed a&s;ide, becau&s;e it was found impracticable to carry them on. The price of all &s;orts of provi&s;ion ro&s;e al|mo&s;t to a dearth: even water was &s;old in the &s;treets of London. In this &s;ea&s;on of di&s;tre&s;s, many wretched families mu&s;t have peri&s;hed by cold and hunger, had not tho&s;e of opulent fortunes been in&s;pired with a remarkable &s;pirit of compa&s;&s;ion and humanity. Nothing can more redound to the honour of the Engli&s;h nation, than did tho&s;e in&s;tances of benevolence and well con|ducted charity which were then exhibited. The liberal hand was not only opened to the profe&s;&s;ed beggar, and the poor that owned their di&s;tre&s;s: but un|common pains were taken to find out and relieve tho&s;e more unhappy objects that from motives of fal&s;e pride, or ingenuous &s;hame, endeavoured to conceal their mi&s;ery. The&s;e were a&s;&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t in their own de&s;pite. The &s;olitary habita|tions of the widow, the fatherle&s;s, and the unfortunate, were vi&s;ited by the beneficent, who felt for the woes of their fellow-creatures; and, to &s;uch as re|fu&s;ed to receive a portion of the public charity, the nece&s;&s;aries of life were privately conveyed in &s;uch a manner as could lea&s;t &s;hock the delicacy of their di&s;po&s;i|tions.</P>

<P>Mean while, preparations of war were vigorou&s;ly carried on by the mini&s;try in England. They had wi&s;ely re&s;olved to annoy the Spaniards in their American p$&s;&s;e&s;&s;$$ns. Three &s;hips of war crui&s;ing in the bay of Bi&s;cay, f$ll in with a large Spani&s;h &s;hrp of the line &s;trongly manned, and took her after a very ob&s;tinate engagement: but the a&s;&s;ogue &s;hips arrived, with the trea&s;ure, in Spain, notwith&s;tanding the vigilance of the Engli&s;h commanders, who were &s;tationed in a certain latitude to intercept that &s;lota. One camp was formed on Houn&s;low heath; and the &s;ix thou&s;and marines lately levied were encamped on the i&s;le of Wight, in order to be embarked for the We&s;t-Indies. Intelligence being received that a &s;trong &s;quadron of Spani&s;h &s;hips of war waited at Ferrol for orders to &s;ail to their American &s;ettlements, Sir John Norris &s;ailed with a powerful fleet from Spithead, to di&s;pute their voyage; and the duke of Cumberland &s;erved in per&s;on as a volunteer in this expedition: but, after divers fruitle&s;s efforts, he was by contrary winds obliged to lie inactive for the greate&s;t part of the &s;ummer in Torbay; and, upon advice that the French and Spani&s;h &s;quadrons had &s;ailed to the We&s;t-Indies in conjunction, the de&s;ign again&s;t Ferrol was wholly layed a&s;ide. In September, a &s;mall &s;qua|dron of &s;hips, commanded by commodore An&s;on, &s;et &s;ail for the South-&s;ea, in order to act again&s;t the enemy on the coa&s;t of Chili and Peru, and co-operate occa&s;ionally with admiral Vernon acro&s;s the i&s;thmus of Darien. The &s;cheme was well layed, but ruined by unnece&s;&s;ary delays, and unfore&s;een ac|cidents. But the hopes of the nation centered chiefly in a formidable arma|ment de&s;igned for the northern coa&s;t of New Spain, and his catholic maje&s;ty's other &s;ettlements on that &s;ide of the Atlantic. Commi&s;&s;ions had been i&s;&s;ued for rai&s;ing a regiment of four battalions in the Engli&s;h colonies of North-America, that they might be tran&s;ported to Jamaica, and join the forces from England. The&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of the marines, and detachments from &s;ome old regiments, were embarked in October at the i&s;le of Wight, under the command of lord Cathcart, a nobleman of approved honour, and great experience in the art of war; and they &s;ailed under convoy of Sir Chaloner Ogle, with a fleet of &s;even and twenty &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates, fire-&s;hips, bomb$ketches, and tenders. They were likewi&s;e furni&s;hed with ho&s;pital-&s;hips, and &s;tore-&s;hips loaded with provi&s;ion, ammunition, all &s;orts of warli$e implements, and every kind of conveni$nce.

<P>The king of Great-Britain having returned to England from his German dominions, the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was opened in November. His maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ured them, on this occa&s;ion, that he was determined to pro|&s;ecute the war vigorou&s;ly, even though France &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of Spain, as her late conduct &s;eemed to favour this &s;uppo&s;ition. He took notice of the emperor's death, as an event which in all likelihood would open a new &s;cene of affairs in Europe; he therefore recommended to their con&s;ideration, the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies for putting the nation in &s;uch a po&s;ture that it &s;hould have nothing to fear from any emergency. Finally, he de&s;ired them to con|&s;ider of &s;ome proper regulations for preventing the exportation of corn, and for more effectual methods to man the fleet at this conjuncture. The com|mons, after having voted an addre&s;s of thanks, brought in a bill for pro|hibiting the exportation of corn and provi&s;ions, for a limited time, out of Great-Britain, Ireland, and the American plantations. This was a mea&s;ure calculated to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be in want of the&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;aries. The French had contracted for a very large quantity of beef and pork in Ireland, for the u&s;e of their own and of the Spani&s;h navy; and an em|bargo had been layed upon the &s;hips of that kingdom. This bill met with a vigorous oppo&s;ition; yet the hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that his maje&s;ty &s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed to lay an immediate embargo upon all the &s;hips laden with corn, grain, &s;tarch, rice, beef, pork, and other provi&s;ions, to be exported to foreign parts. They likewi&s;e re&s;olved, that the thanks of the hou&s;e &s;hould be given to vice-admiral Vernon, for the &s;ervices he had done to his king and country in the We&s;t-Indies. One William Cooley was examined at the bar of the hou&s;e, and committed to pri&s;on, after having owned him&s;elf author of a paper intituled, "Con&s;iderations upon the embargo on provi&s;ion of victual." The performance contained many &s;hrewd and &s;evere animadver&s;ions upon the go|vernment, for having taken a &s;tep which, without an&s;wering the purpo&s;e of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the enemy, would prove a grievous di&s;couragement to trade, and ruin all the graziers of Ireland. Notwith&s;tanding the arguments u&s;ed in this remon&s;trance, and &s;everal petitions that were pre&s;ented again&s;t the corn-bill, it pa&s;&s;ed by meer dint of mini&s;terial influence. The other party endeavoured, by various $otions, to &s;et on foot an inquiry into the orders, letters, and in|&s;tructions, which had been &s;ent to admiral Vernon and admiral Haddock: but all &s;uch inve&s;tigations were carefully avoided.</P>

a &s;cheme by which the ju&s;tices of the peace were empowered to i&s;&s;ue war|rants to con&s;tables and headboroughs, to &s;earch by day of night for &s;uch &s;ea|faring men as &s;hould conceal them&s;elves within their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions. Tho&s;e &s;earchers were ve&s;ted with authority to force open doors, in ca&s;e of re|&s;i&s;tance; and encouraged to this violence by a reward for every &s;eaman they &s;hould di&s;cover; while the unhappy wretches &s;o di&s;covered were dragged into the &s;ervice, and their names entered in a regi&s;ter to be kept at the navy or the admiralty-office. Such a plan of tyranny did not pa$s uncen&s;ured. Every excep|tionable clau&s;e produced a warm debate, in which Sir John Barnard, Mr. Pulteney, Mr. Sandys, lord Gage, Mr. Pitt, and Mr. Lyttleton, &s;ignalized them&s;elves nobly in defending the liberties of their fellow-&s;ubjects. Mr. Pitt having expre&s;&s;ed a laudable indignation at &s;uch a large &s;tride towards de&s;potic power, in ju&s;tifica|tion of which nothing could be urged but the plea of nece&s;&s;ity, Mr. H. Wal|pole thought proper to attack him with &s;ome per&s;onal &s;arca&s;ms. He reflected upon his youth; and ob&s;erved, that the di&s;covery of truth was very little pro|moted by pompous diction and theatrical emotion. The&s;e in&s;inuations expo&s;ed him to a &s;evere reply. Mr. Pitt &s;tanding up again, &s;aid, he would not un|dertake to determine whether youth could be ju&s;tly imputed to any man as a reproach: but he affirmed, that the wretch, who, after having &s;een the con&s;e|quences of repeated errors, continues &s;till to blunder, and who&s;e age has only added ob&s;tinacy to &s;tupidity, is &s;urely the object of either abhorrence or contempt, and de&s;erves not that his grey head &s;hould &s;ecure him from in&s;ults: much more is he to be abhorred, who, as he has advanced in age, has receded from virtue, and becomes more wicked with le&s;s temptation; who pro&s;titutes him&s;elf for money which he cannot enjoy; and &s;pends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country. Petitions were pre&s;ented from the city of Lon|don, and county of Glouce&s;ter, again&s;t the bill, as detrimental to the trade and navigation of the kingdom, by di&s;couraging rather than encouraging &s;ailors, and de&s;tructive to the liberties of the &s;ubject: but they were both rejected, as in&s;ults upon the hou&s;e of commons. After very long debates maintained on both &s;ides with extraordinary ardour and emotion, the &s;evere clau&s;es were dropped, and the bill pa&s;&s;ed with amendments.</P>

<P>But the mo&s;t remarkable incident of this &s;e&s;&s;ion was an open and per&s;onal attack upon the mini&s;ter, who was become extremely unpopular all over the kingdom. The people were now more than ever &s;en&s;ible of the grievous taxes under which they groaned; and &s;aw their burdens daily in|crea&s;ing. No effectual attempt had as yet been made to annoy the enemy. Ex|pen&s;ive &s;quadrons had been equipped; had made excur&s;ions and returned without &s;triking a blow. The Spani&s;h fleet had &s;ailed fir&s;t from Cadiz, and then from Ferrol, without any interruption from admiral Haddock, who commanded the Briti&s;h &s;quadron in the Mediterranean, and who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be re|&s;tricted by the in&s;tructions he had received from the mini&s;try, though in fact his want of &s;ucce&s;s was owing to accident. Admiral Vernon had written from the We&s;t-I$$$es to his private friends, that he was neglected, and in danger of being &s;acrificed. Notwith&s;tanding the numerous navy which the nation maintained, the Spani&s;h privateers made prize of the Briti&s;h merchant-&s;hips with impunity. In violation of treaties, and in contempt of that intimate connection which had been &s;o long cultivated between the French and Engli&s;h mini&s;try,
<PB N="603" REF="6060">
the king of France had ordered the harbour and fortifications of Dunkirk to be repaired: his fleet had &s;ailed to the We&s;t-Indies, in conjunction with that of Spain; and the merchants of England began to tremble for Jamaica: finally, commerce was in a manner &s;u&s;pended, by the practice of pre&s;&s;ing &s;ailors into the &s;ervice, and by the embargo which had been layed upon &s;hips in all the ports of Great-Britain and Ireland. The&s;e cau&s;es of popular di&s;con|tent, added to other complaints which had been &s;o long repeated again&s;t the mini&s;ter, exaggerated and inculcated by his enemies with unwearied indu&s;try, at length rendered him &s;o univer&s;ally odious, that his name was &s;eldom or never mentioned with decency, except by his own dependants.</P>

<P>The country-party in parliament &s;eized this opportunity of ven|geance. Mr. Sandys went up to Sir Robert Walpole in the hou&s;e, and told him, that on Friday next he &s;hould bring a charge again&s;t him in public. The mini&s;ter &s;eemed to be &s;urpri&s;ed at this unexpected intimation; but, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, thanked him politely for this previous notice, and &s;aid, he de&s;ired no favour, but fair play <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon this occa&s;ion he mi&s;quoted Horace. <Q>&startq;As I am not con&s;cious of any crime, (&s;aid he) I do not doubt of being able to make a pro|per defence. Nil con&s;cire &s;ibi nulli palle&s;cere culpae.&endq;</Q> He was corrected by Mr. Pulteney; but in&s;i&s;ted upon his being in the right, and actually laid a wager of a guinea on the ju&s;tne&s;s of his quotation.</NOTE>. Mr. Sandys, at the time which he had appointed for this accu&s;ation, &s;tood up, and in a &s;tudied &s;peech entered into a long deduc|tion of the mini&s;ter's mi&s;conduct. He in&s;i&s;ted upon the di&s;contents of the nation at the mea&s;ures which had been for many years pur&s;ued at home and abroad. He profe&s;&s;ed his belief that there was not a gentleman in the hou&s;e who did not know, that one &s;ingle per&s;on in the admini&s;tration was the chief, if not the &s;ole advi&s;er and promoter, of all tho&s;e mea&s;ures. <Q>&startq;This (added he) is known without doors as well as within; therefore the di&s;contents, the reproaches, and even the cur&s;es of the people, are all directed again&s;t that &s;ingle per&s;on. They complain of pre&s;ent mea&s;ures; they have &s;uffered by pa&s;t mea&s;ures; they expect no redre&s;s; they expect no alteration or amendment, whil&s;t he has a &s;hare in directing or advi&s;ing our future admini&s;tration. The&s;e, Sir, are the &s;entiments of the people in regard to that mini&s;ter: the&s;e &s;enti|ments we are in honour and duty bound to repre&s;ent to his maje&s;ty; and the proper method for doing this, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by our con&s;titution, is to addre&s;s his maje&s;ty to remove him from his councils.&endq;</Q> He then proceeded to explain the particulars of the mini&s;ter's mi&s;conduct in the whole &s;eries of his negotiations abroad. He charged him with having endeavoured to &s;upport his own intere&s;t, and to erect a kind of de&s;potic government, by the practice of corruption; with having betrayed the intere&s;t and honour of Great-Britain in the late convention; with having neglected to pro&s;ecute the war again&s;t Spain; and he concluded with a motion for an addre&s;s to the king, that he would be plea&s;ed to remove Sir Robert Walpole from his pre&s;ence and councils for ever. He was an&s;wered by Mr. Pelham, who undertook to defend or excu&s;e all the mea|&s;ures which the other had condemned; and acquitted him&s;elf as a warm friend and un&s;haken adherent. Again&s;t this champion Sir John Barnard entered the li&s;ts, and was &s;u&s;tained by Mr. Pulteney, who, with equal &s;pirit and pre|ci&s;ion,
<PB N="604" REF="6070">
pointed out and expo&s;ed all the material errors and mal-practices of the admini&s;tration. Sir Robert Walpole &s;poke with great temper and delibera|tion in behalf of him&s;elf. With re&s;pect to the article of bribery and cor|ruption, he &s;aid, if any one in&s;tance had been mentioned; if it had been $hewn that he ever offered a reward to any member of either hou&s;e, or ever threatened to deprive any member of his office or employment, in order to in|fluence his voting in parliament, there might have been &s;ome ground for this charge; but, when it was &s;o generally layed, he did not know what he could &s;ay to it, unle&s;s to deny it as generally and as po&s;itively as it had been a&s;|&s;erted. Such a declaration as this, in the hearing of &s;o many per&s;ons, who not only knew, but &s;ub$$&s;ted by his wages of corruption, was a &s;trong proof of the mini&s;ter's being dead to all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, and all regard to veracity$ The debate was protracted by the court-members till three o'clock in the morn|ing, when above &s;ixty of the oppo&s;ite party having retired, the motion was re|jected by a con&s;iderable majority.</P>

<P>A bill was brought in for prohibiting the practice of in&s;uring &s;hips belonging to the enemies of the nation; but it was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Sir John Barnard and Mr. Willimot, who demon&s;trated that this kind of traffic was advantageous to the kingdom; and the &s;cheme was dropped. An|other warm conte&s;t aro$e upon a clau&s;e of the mutiny$bill relating to the quartering of &s;oldiers upon inn-keepers and publicans, who complained of their being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in furni&s;hing tho&s;e gue&s;ts with provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries at the rates pre&s;cribed by law or cu&s;tom. There were not wanting advocates to expatiate upon the nature of this grievance, which however was not re|dre&s;&s;ed. A new trade was at this time opened with Per&s;ia, through the do|minions of the czar, and ve&s;ted with an exclu&s;ive privilege in the Ru&s;&s;ia com|pany, by an act of parliament. The commons voted forty thou&s;and &s;eamen for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, and about thirty thou&s;and men for the etabli&s;hment of land-forces. They provided for the &s;ub&s;idies granted to the king of Denmark and the landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el; and took every &s;tep which was &s;ugge&s;ted for the $a&s;e and convenience of the government.</P>

<P>The parties in the hou&s;e of lords were influenced by the &s;ame motives which actuated the commons. The duke of Argyle, who had by this time re&s;igned all his places, declared open war again&s;t the mini&s;try. In the be|ginning of the &s;e&s;&s;$on, the king's &s;peech was no &s;ooner reported by the chan|cellor, than this nobleman &s;tood up and moved, that a general addre&s;s of thanks &s;$cul$ o$ pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, in&s;tead of a recapitulation of every para|graph o$ the king's &s;peech, re echoed from the parliament to the throne, with $span$ o$ $$$nd approbation, implying a general concurrence with all the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;ter. He &s;poke on this &s;ubject with an a&s;toni&s;hing $word$ o$ e$$quence, that rolled like a river which had over$ow$$ $t$ banks and $$$$ged the w$ole adjacent country. The motion was &s;upporte$ by lord b$$n$r$t, $word$ Carteret, the earl of Che&s;ter&s;ield, and lord Gower, who, though they $$$pl$yed all the talents of orat$ry, were out-voted by the op$o&s;ite party, he$$ed by the $u$e of Newc$&s;$$e, the earl of Cholmondely, lord $ervey, and the $ord chancellor. The motion was rejected, and the addre&s;s compo&s;ed in the $span$ The &s;a$e motions for an inquiry into orders and in&s;tructions, which had m$carrie$ in the lower hou&s;e, were here repeated with the &s;ame bad
<PB N="605" REF="6080">
&s;ucce&s;s; and, in the debates which en&s;ued, the young earls of Hallifax and Sandwich acquired a con&s;iderable &s;hare of reputation, for the &s;trength of ar|gument and elocution with which they contended again&s;t the adherents of the mini&s;try. When the hou&s;e took into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the army, the duke of Argyle having harrangued with equal &s;kill and energy on military af|fairs, propo&s;ed that the &s;orces &s;hould be augmented by adding new levies to the old companies, without increa&s;ing the number of officers; a practice that &s;erved only to deba&s;e the dignity of the &s;ervice, by rai&s;ing the lowe&s;t of man|kind to the rank of gentlemen; and to extend the influence of the mini&s;ter, by multiplying his dependents. He therefore moved for a re&s;olution, that the augmenting the army by rai&s;ing regiments, as it is the mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary and mo&s;t expen&s;ive method of augmentation, is al&s;o the mo&s;t dangerous to the liberties of the nation. This propo&s;al was likewi&s;e over-ruled, after a &s;hort though warm contention. This was the fate of all the other motions made by the lords in the oppo&s;ition; though the victory of the courtiers was always clogged with a nervous and &s;pirited prote&s;t. Two days were expended in the debate produced by lord Carteret's motion for an addre&s;s, be&s;eeching his ma|je&s;ty to remove. Sir Robert Walpole from his pre&s;ence and councils for ever. The &s;peech that u&s;hered in this memorable motion would not have di&s;graced a Cicero. It contained a retro&s;pect of all the public mea&s;ures which had been pur&s;ued &s;ince the revolution. It explained the nature of every treaty, whether right or wrong, which had been concluded under the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. It de&s;cribed the political connexions &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the different powers in Europe. It expo&s;ed the weakne&s;s, the mi&s;conduct, and the iniquity of the mini&s;ter, both in his foreign and dome&s;tic tran&s;actions. It was embelli&s;hed with all the ornaments of rhetoric, and warmed with a noble &s;pirit of patriot indignation. The duke of Argyle, the lord Bathur&s;t, and his other colleagues, &s;eemed to be animated with uncommon fervour, and even in&s;pired, by the &s;ub|ject. A man of imagination, in reading their &s;peeches, will think him&s;elf<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1741.</NOTE> tran&s;ported into the Roman &s;enate, before the ruin of that republic. Never|thele&s;s, the mini&s;ter &s;till triumphed by dint of number; though his victory was dearly purcha&s;ed. Thirty peers entered a vigorous prote&s;t; and Walpole's character &s;u&s;tained &s;uch a rude &s;hock from this oppo&s;ition, that his authority &s;eemed to be drawing near a period. Immediately after this conte&s;t was de|cided, the duke of Marlborough moved for a re&s;olution, that any attempt to inflict any kind of puni&s;hment on any per&s;on, without allowing him an op|portunity to make his defence, or without any proof of any crime or mi&s;de|meanour committed by him, is contrary to natural ju&s;tice, the fundamental laws of the realm, and the antient e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;age of parliament; and is a high infringement of the liberties of the &s;ubject. It was &s;econded by the duke of Devon&s;hire and the lord Lovel; and oppo&s;ed by lord Gower, as an intended cen&s;ure on the proceedings of the day. This &s;entiment was &s;o warmly e&s;pou&s;ed by lord Talbot, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the former debate, that he &s;eemed to be tran&s;ported beyond the bounds of moderation. He was inter|rupted by the earl of Cholmondely, who charged him with having violated the order and decorum which ought to be pre&s;erved in &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly. His pa&s;&s;ion was inflamed by this rebuke: he declared him&s;elf an independent lord; a character which he would not forfeit for the &s;miles of a court, the profit of
<PB N="606" REF="6090">
an employment, or the reward of a pen&s;ion: he &s;aid, when he was engaged on the &s;ide of truth, he would trample on the in&s;olence that &s;hould command him to &s;uppre&s;s his &s;entiments. On a divi&s;ion, however, the motion was carried.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>In the beginning of April, the king repairing to the hou&s;e of peers, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome acts that were ready for the royal a&s;&s;ent. Then, in his &s;peech to both hou&s;es, he gave them to under&s;tand, that the queen of Hun|gary had made requi&s;ition of the twelve thou&s;and men &s;tipulated by treaty; and that he had ordered the &s;ub&s;idy-troops of Denmark and He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el to be in readine&s;s to march to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He ob&s;erved, that in this compli|cated and uncertain &s;tate of affairs, many incidents might ari&s;e, and render it nece&s;&s;ary for him to incur extraordinary expences for maintaining the prag|matic &s;anction, at a time when he could not po&s;&s;ibly have recour&s;e to the ad|vice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his parliament. He therefore demanded of the com|mons &s;uch a &s;upply as might be requi&s;ite for the&s;e ends; and promi&s;ed to manage it with all po&s;&s;ible frugality. The lower hou&s;e, in their addre&s;s, approved of all his mea&s;ures; declared they would effectually &s;upport him again&s;t all in&s;ults and attacks that might be made upon any of his territories, though not belonging to the crown of Great-Britain; and that they would enable him to contribute, in the mo&s;t effectual manner, to the &s;upport of the queen of Hungary. Sir Robert Walpole moved, that an aid of two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be granted to that prince&s;s. Mr. Shippen prote&s;ted again&s;t any interpo&s;ition in the affairs of Germany. He expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;|like of the promi&s;e which had been made to defend his maje&s;ty's foreign do|minions; a promi&s;e, in his opinion, incon&s;i&s;tent with that important and inviolable law, the act of &s;ettlement; a promi&s;e which, could it have been foreknown, would perhaps have for ever precluded from the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion that illu&s;trious family to which the nation owed &s;uch numberle&s;s ble&s;|&s;ings, &s;uch continued felicity. The motion however pa&s;&s;ed, though not without further oppo&s;ition; and the hou&s;e re&s;olved, that three hundred thou|&s;and pounds &s;hould be granted to his maje&s;ty, to enable him effectually to &s;up|port the queen of Hungary. Towards the expence of this year, a million was deducted from the &s;inking-fund; and the land-tax continued at four &s;hillings in the pound. The preparations for this war had already co&s;t five millions. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed on the twenty-fifth day of April, when the king took his leave of this parliament, with warm expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s and &s;ati&s;|faction. Henry Bromley, Stephen Fox, and John Howe, three members of the lower hou&s;e, who had &s;ignalized them&s;elves in defence of the mini&s;ter, were now enobled, and created barons of Montfort, Ilche&s;ter, and Chedworth. A camp was formed near Colche&s;ter; and the king having appointed a re|gency, &s;et out in May for his German dominions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir William Wyndham died in the preceding year, deeply regreted as an orator, a patriot, and a man, the con&s;tant a&s;&s;ertor of Briti&s;h liberty, and one of the chief ornaments of the Engli&s;h na|tion. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ame year, general Oglethorpe, governor of Georgia, had, with &s;ome &s;uccours obtained from the colony of Carolina, and a &s;mall &s;quadron of the king's &s;hips, made an attempt upon fort Augu&s;tine, the capital of Spani&s;h Florida; and actually reduced &s;ome &s;mall forts in the neighbourhood of the place: but the Carolinians withdrawing in di&s;gu&s;t, di&s;&s;en&s;ions prevailing among the &s;ea-officers, the hurricane months approaching, and the enemy having re|ceived a &s;upply and reinforcement, he abandoned the enterprize, and returned to Georgia.</NOTE>.</P>

After they had fought during the be&s;t part of the night, t$e enemy ho$$ted th$ir c$lours in the morning, and appeared to be part of the Frenc$ &s;quadron$ which had &s;ailed from Europe under the command of the marqu$s $e An$$n, with orders to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Spani&s;h admiral de Torres, in at|t$cking and $word$ r$$$ing the Engli&s;h &s;hips and colonies.

<P>In the mean time Sir Chaloner Ogle arrived at Jamaica, where he joined vice-admiral Vernon, who now found him&s;elf at the head of the mo&s;t $o$midable $$eet and army that ever vi&s;ited tho&s;e &s;eas, with full power to act at di$er$non. The conjoined &s;quadrons con&s;i&s;ted of nine and twenty &s;hips of the line$ with almo&s;t an equal number of frigates, fire&s;hips, and bomb ketches, well manned$ and plentifully &s;upplied with all kinds of provi&s;ions, &s;tores, and n$ce&s;&s;aries. The number of &s;eamen amounted to fifteen thou&s;and: that of the land-forces, including the American regiment of four battalions, and a body o$ negroes in$&s;ted at Jamaica, did not fall &s;hort of twelve thou&s;and. Had this armament been ready to act in the proper &s;ea&s;on of the year, under the conduct of wi&s;e experienced officers, united in councils, and &s;teadily attached to the inte|re&s;t and honour of their country, the Havannah, and whole i&s;land of Cuba might have been ea&s;ily reduced; the whole trea&s;ure of the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies would have been intercepted; and Spain mu&s;t have been humbled into the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But &s;everal unfavourable circum&s;tances concurred to fru&s;trate the hopes of the public. The mini&s;try had detained Sir Chaloner Ogle at Spithead, without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e, until the &s;ea&s;on for action was al|mo&s;t exhau&s;ted: for, on the continent of New Spain, the periodical rains begin about the end of April; and this change in the atmo&s;phere is always attended with epidemical di&s;tempers, which render the climate extremely unhealthy: be|&s;ides, the rain is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that for the &s;pace of two months no army can keep the field.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; III.</HEAD>
<P>Sir Chaloner Ogle arrived at Jama$ca on the ninth day of January; and admiral Vernon did not &s;ail on his intended expedition till towards the end of the month. In&s;tead of directing his cour&s;e to the Havannah, which lay to leeward, and might have been reached in le&s;s than three days, he re&s;olved to beat up again&s;t the wind to Hi&s;pan$ola, in o$der to ob&s;erve the motion of the French &s;quadron, commanded by the m$rquis de Antin. The fifteenth day of February had elap&s;ed before he received certain information that the French admiral had &s;ailed for Europe in great di&s;tre&s;s, for want of men and provi&s;ions,
<PB N="609" REF="6120">
which he could not procure in the We&s;t-Indies. Admiral Vernon thus di&s;ap|pointed, called a council of war, in which it was determined to proceed for Car|thagena. The fleet being &s;upplied with wood and water at Hi&s;paniola, &s;et &s;ail for the continent of New-Spain, and on the fourth of March anchored in Playa Grande, to the windward of Carthagena. Admiral de Torres had al|ready &s;ailed to the Havannah; but the place was &s;trongly fortified, and the garri&s;ons reinforced by the crews of a &s;mall &s;quadron of large &s;hips, commanded by Don Blas de Le&s;o, an officer of experience and reputation. There they lay inactive till the ninth, when the troops were landed on the i&s;land of Tierra Bomba, near the mouth of the harbour, known by the name of Boca-chica, or Little-mouth, which was &s;urpri&s;ingly fortified with ca&s;tles, batteries, booms, chains, cables, and &s;hips of war. The Briti&s;h forces erected a battery on &s;hore, with which they made a breach in the principal fort, while the admiral &s;ent in a number of &s;hips to divide the fire of the enemy, and co-operate with the endeavours of the army. Lord Aubrey Beauclerc, a gallant officer, who commanded one of the&s;e &s;hips, was &s;lain on this occa&s;ion. The breach being deemed practicable, the forces advanced to the attack: but, the forts and bat|teries were abandoned; the Spani&s;h &s;hips that lay athwart the harbour's mouth, were de&s;troyed or taken; the pa&s;&s;age was opened, and the fleet entered without further oppo&s;ition. Then the forces were reimbarked with the artillery, and landed within a mile of Carthagena, where they were oppo&s;ed by about &s;even hundred Spaniards, whom they obliged to retire. The admiral and general had contracted a hearty contempt for each other, and took all opportunities of expre&s;&s;ing their mutual di&s;like: far from acting vigorou&s;ly in concert, for the advantage of the community, they maintained a mutual re&s;erve, and &s;eparate cabals; and each proved more eager for the di&s;grace of his rival, than zealous for the honour of the nation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>The general complained that the fleet lay idle, while his troops were harra&s;&s;ed and dimini&s;hed by hard duty and di&s;temper. The admiral affirmed, that his &s;hips could not lie near enough to batter the town of Carthagena; and up|braided the general with inactivity and want of re&s;olution to attack the fort of St. Lazar, which commanded the town, and might be taken by &s;calade. Went|worth, &s;timulated by the&s;e reproaches, re&s;olved to try the experiment. His forces marched up to the attack; but the guides being &s;lain, they mi&s;took their route, and advanced to the &s;tronge&s;t part of the fortification, where they were moreover expo&s;ed to the fire of the town. Colonel Grant, who commanded the grenadi$rs, was mortally wounded: the &s;caling-ladders were found too &s;hort; the officers were perplexed for want of orders and directions: yet the &s;oldiers &s;u&s;$$ined a &s;evere fire for &s;everal hours with &s;urpri&s;ing intrepidity, and at length re$reated, leaving about &s;ix hundred killed or wounded on the &s;pot. Their number was now &s;o much reduced, that they could no longer maintain their footing on &s;hore: be&s;ides, the rainy &s;ea&s;on had begun with &s;uch violence, as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them to live in camp. They were therefore reimbarked; and all hope of further &s;ucce&s;s immediately vani&s;hed. The admiral, however, in order to demon&s;trate the impracticability of taking the place by &s;ea, &s;ent in the Gallicia, one of the Spani&s;h &s;hips which had been taken at Boca-chica, to cano|nade the town, with &s;ixteen guns mounted on one &s;ide, like a floating batte|ry. This ve&s;&s;el, manned by detachments of volunteers from different &s;hips,
<PB N="610" REF="6130">
and commanded by captain Hore, was warped into the inner harbour, and moored before day, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the walls, and in very &s;hal|low water. In this po&s;ition &s;he &s;tood the fire of &s;everal batteries for &s;ome hours, without doing or &s;u&s;taining much damage: then the admiral ordered the men to be brought off in boats, and the cables to be cut; &s;o that &s;he drove with the &s;ea-breeze upon a &s;hoal, where &s;he was &s;oon filled with water. This exploit was ab&s;urd, and the inference which the admiral drew from it, altogether fa|lacious. He &s;aid, it plainly proved, that there was not depth of water in the inner harbour, &s;ufficient to admit large &s;hips near enough to batter the town, with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. This indeed was the ca&s;e in that part of the har|bour, to which the Gallicia was conducted; but a little farther to the left, he might have &s;tationed four or five of his large&s;t &s;hips a-brea&s;t, within pi&s;tol-&s;hot of the walls: and if this &s;tep had been taken, when the land-forces marched to the attack of St. Lazar, in all probability the town would have been &s;urren|dered.</P>

<P>After the reimbarkation of the troops, the di&s;tempers peculiar to the climate and &s;ea&s;on began to rage with redoubled fury; and great numbers of tho&s;e who e&s;caped the vengeance of the enemy, peri&s;hed by a more painful and inglorious &s;ate. Nothing was heard but complaints and execrations: the groans of the dying, and the &s;ervice for the dead; nothing was &s;een but objects of woe, and images of dejection. The conductors of this unfortunate expedition agreed in nothing but the expediency of a &s;peedy retreat from this &s;cene of mi|&s;ery and di&s;grace. The fortifications of the harbour were demoli&s;hed, and the fleet returned to Jamaica. The mi&s;carriage of this expedition, which had co&s;t the nation an immen&s;e &s;um of money, was no &s;ooner known in England, than the kingdom was filled with murmurs and di&s;content, and the people were de|pre&s;&s;ed, in proportion to that &s;anguine hope by which they had been elevated. Admiral Vernon, in&s;tead of undertaking any enterprize which might have retrieved the honour of the Briti&s;h arms, &s;et &s;ail from Jamaica with the forces in July, and anchored at the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of Cuba, in a bay, on which he be&s;towed the appellation of Cumberland harbour. The troops were landed, and encamped at the di&s;tance of twenty miles farther up the river, where they remained totally inactive, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted chiefly on &s;alt and damaged provi&s;ions, till the month of November, when, being con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by &s;ickne&s;s, they were put on board again, and reconveyed to Jamaica. He was afterwards reinforced from England by four &s;hips of war, and about three thou&s;and &s;ol|diers; but, he performed nothing worthy of the reputation he had acquired; and the people began to perceive that they had mi&s;taken his character.</P>

<P>The affairs on the continent of Europe were now more than even embroiled. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia had demanded of the court of Vienna part of Sile&s;ia, by virtue of old treaties of co-fraternity, which were either ob&s;olete or annulled; and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i$t the queen with all his forces, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould eomply with his demand: but this being rejected with di&s;dain, he entered Sile&s;ia at the head of an army, and pro&s;ecuted his conque&s;ts with great rapidi|ty. In the mean time the queen of Hungary was crowned at Pre&s;burg, after having &s;igned a capitulation, by which the liberties of that kingdom were con|formed; and the grand duke her con&s;ort was, at her reque&s;t, a&s;&s;ociated with her for ten years in the government. At the &s;ame time the &s;tates of Hungary
<PB N="611" REF="6140">
refu&s;ed to receive a memorial from the elector of Bavaria. During the&s;e tran|&s;actions, his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty made his public entrance into Bre&s;lau, and con|firmed all the privileges of the inhabitants. One of his generals &s;urpri&s;ed the town and fortre&s;s of Jablunka, on the confines of Hungary; prince Leo|pold of Anhalt-De&s;&s;au, who commanded another army, which formed the blockade of Great Glogau on the Oder, took the place by &s;calade, made the generals Wallis and Rey&s;ki pri&s;oners, with a thou&s;and men that were in garri|&s;on; and here he found the military che&s;t, fifty pieces of bra&s;s cannon, and a great quantity of ammunition.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; VII.</HEAD>
<P>The queen of Hungary had &s;olicited the maritime powers for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, but found them fearful and backward. Being obliged, therefore, to ex|ert her&s;elf with the more vigour, &s;he ordered count Neuperg to a&s;&s;emble a body of forces, and endeavour to &s;top the progre&s;s of the Pru&s;&s;ians in Sile&s;ia. The two armies encountered each other in the neighbourhood of Nie&s;s, at a village called Molwitz; and, after an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, the Au&s;trians were obliged to retire, with the lo&s;s of four thou&s;and men killed, wounded, or taken. The advantage was dearly purcha&s;ed by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. His kin&s;man Frede|ric, margrave of Brandenburgh, and lieutenant-general Schuylemberg were killed in the engagement, together with a great number of general officers, and about two thou&s;and &s;oldiers. After this action, Brieg was &s;urrendered to the victor, and he forced the important pa&s;s of Fryewalde, which was defended by four thou&s;and Au&s;trian hu&s;&s;ars. The Engli&s;h and Dutch mini&s;ters, who ac|companied him in his progre&s;s, &s;pared no pains to effect an accommodation: but the two &s;overeigns were too much irritated again&s;t each other, to acquie&s;ce in any terms that could be propo&s;ed. The queen of Hungary was incen&s;ed to find her&s;elf attacked, in the day of her di&s;tre&s;s, by a prince to whom &s;he had given no &s;ort of provocation; and his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty charged the court of Vienna with a de&s;ign either to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate, of carry him off by treachery: a de|&s;ign which was di&s;owned with expre&s;&s;ions of indignation and di&s;dain. Count Neuperg being obliged to abandon Sile&s;ia, in order to oppo&s;e the Bavarian arms in Bohemia, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;ent thither a detachment to join the elec|tor, under the command of count De&s;lau, who, in his route, reduced Glatz and Nei&s;s, almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition: then his ma&s;ter received the homage of the Sile&s;ian &s;tates at Bre&s;lau, and returned to Berlin. In December, the Pru&s;&s;ian army was di&s;tributed in winter-quarters in Moravia, after having taken Olmutz, the capital of that province; and, in March, his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty formed a camp of ob&s;ervation in the neighbourhood of Magdeburg.</P>

<P>The elector of Hanover was alarmed at the &s;ucce&s;s of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, in apprehen&s;ion that he would become too formidable a neighbour. A &s;cheme was &s;aid to have been propo&s;ed to the court of Vienna, for attacking that prince's electoral dominions, and dividing the conque&s;t: but it never was put in execution. Neverthele&s;s, the troops of Hanover were augmented; the auxiliary Danes and He&s;&s;ians in the pay of Great Britain were ordered to be in readine&s;s to march, and a number of Briti&s;h forces encamped and prepared for embarkation. The &s;ub&s;idy of three hundred thou&s;and pounds, granted by parliament, was remitted to the queen of Hungary; and every thing &s;eemed to pre&s;age the vigorous interpo&s;ition of his Britannic maje&s;ty. But in a little time after his arrival at Hanover, that &s;pirit of action &s;eemed to flag, even

while her Hungarian maje&s;ty to tottered on the verge of ruin. France re|&s;olved to &s;eize this opportunity of cru&s;hing the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. In order to intimidate the elector of Hanover, marechal Mallebois was &s;ent with a nume|rous army into We&s;tphalia; and this expedient proved effectual. A treaty of neutrality was concluded; and the king of Great-Britain engaged to vote for the elector of Bavaria at the en&s;uing election of an emperor. The de&s;ign of the French court was to rai&s;e this prince to the Imperial dignity, and furni&s;h him with &s;uch &s;uccours as &s;hould enable him to deprive the queen of Hungary of her hereditary dominions.</P>

<P>While the French mini&s;ter at Vienna endeavoured to amu&s;e the queen with the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of his ma&s;ter's friend&s;hip, a body of five and thirty thou&s;and men began their march for Germany, in order to join the elector of Ba|varia: another French army was a&s;&s;embled upon the Rhine; and the count de Bellei&s;le being provided with large &s;ums of money, was &s;ent to negotiate with the different electors. Having thus &s;ecured a majority of voices, he proceeded to Munich, where he pre&s;ented the elector of Bavaria with a commi&s;&s;ion ap|pointing him generali&s;&s;imo of the French troops marching to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and now the treaty of Nymphenburg was concluded. The French king en|gaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t the elector with his whole power, towards rai&s;ing him to the Im|perial throne: the elector promi&s;ed, that after his elevation he would never attempt to recover any of the towns or provinces of the empire which France had conquered: that he would, in his Imperial capacity, renounce the barrier-treaty; and agree, that France &s;hould irrevocably retain whatever places &s;he &s;hould &s;ubdue in the Au&s;trian Netherlands. The next &s;tep of Bellei&s;le was to negotiate another treaty between France and Pru&s;&s;ia, importing, That the elector of Bavaria &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s Bohemia, Upper Au&s;tria, and the Tyrole&s;e: That the king of Poland &s;hould be gratified with Moravia and Upper Sile&s;ia: and, That his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty &s;hould retain Lower Sile&s;ia, with the town of Nei&s;s and the county of Glatz. The&s;e precautions being taken, the count de Bellei&s;le repaired to Franckfort, in quality of amba&s;&s;ador and plenipo|tentiary from France, at the Imperial diet of election. It was in this city that the French king publi&s;hed a declaration, &s;ignifying, that as the king of Great-Britain had a&s;&s;embled an army to influence the approaching election of an em|peror, his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, as guarantee of the treaty of We&s;tphalia, had ordered &s;ome troops to advance towards the Rhine, with a view to maintain the tranquillity of the Germanic body, and &s;ecure the freedom of the Imperial election.</P>

<P>In July the elector of Bavaria being joined by the French forces under m$rechal Broglio, &s;urpri&s;ed the imperial city of Paf&s;au upon the Danube; and entering Upper Au&s;tria, at the head of &s;eventy thou&s;and men, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Li$tz, where he received the homage of the &s;tates of that country. Under|&s;tanding that the garri&s;on of Vienna was very numerous, and that count Pal&s;i had a&s;&s;embled thirty thou&s;and Hungarians in the neighbourhood of this capital, he made no farther progre&s;s in Au&s;tria, but marched into Bohemia, where he was reinforced by a con&s;iderable body of Saxons, under the command of count Rutow&s;ki, natural &s;on to the late king of Poland. By this time his Poli&s;h ma|je&s;ty had acceded to the treaty of Nymphenburg, and declared war again&s;t the queen of Hungary, on the mo&s;t frivolous pretences. The elector of Bavaria
<PB N="613" REF="6160">
advanced to Prague, which was taken in the night by &s;calade: an atchievement in which Maurice count of Saxe$ another natural &s;on of the king of Poland, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf at the head of the French forces. In December the elector of Bavaria made his public entry into this capital, where he was proclaimed king of Bohemia, and inaugurated with the u&s;ual &s;olemnities: then he &s;et out for Franckfort, to be pre&s;ent at the diet of election.</P>

<P>At this period the queen of Hungary &s;aw her&s;elf abandoned by all her allies, and &s;eemingly devoted to de&s;truction. She was not, however, for|&s;aken by her courage; nor de&s;titute of good officers and an able mini&s;try. She retired to Pre&s;burg, and in a pathetic Latin &s;peech to the &s;tates, expre&s;&s;ed her confidence in the loyalty and valour of her Hungarian &s;ubjects. The no|bility of that kingdom, touched with her pre&s;ence and di&s;tre&s;s, a&s;&s;ured her una|nimou&s;ly, that they would &s;acrifice their lives and fortunes in her defence. The ban being rai&s;ed, that brave people crowded to her &s;tandard; and the diet ex|pre&s;&s;ed their re&s;entment again&s;t her enemy by a public edict, excluding for ever the electoral hou&s;e of Bavaria from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Hun|gary: yet, without the &s;ub&s;idy &s;he received from Great-Britain their courage and attachment would have proved ineffectual. By this &s;upply &s;he was enabled to pay her army, erect magazines, complete her warlike preparations, and put her &s;trong places in a po&s;ture of defence. In December her generals Berenclau and Mentzel defeated count Thoring, who commanded eight thou&s;and men, at the pa&s;s of Scardingen, and opening their way into Bavaria, layed the whole country under contribution; while count Khevenhuller retook the city of Lintz, and drove the French troops out of Au&s;tria. The grand &s;ignor a&s;&s;ured the queen of Hungary, that far from taking advantage of her troubles, he &s;hould &s;eize all opportunities to convince her of his friend&s;hip: the pope permit|ted her to levy a tenth on the revenues of the clergy within her dominions$ and even to u&s;e all the church-plate for the &s;upport of the war.</P>

<P>As the czarina expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to a&s;&s;i&s;t this unfortunate prin|ce&s;s, the French court re&s;olved to find her employment in another quarter. They had already gained over to their intere&s;t count Gyllenburg, primi-mini&s;ter and pre&s;ident of the chancery in Sweden. A di&s;pute happening between him and Mr. Burnaby, the Briti&s;h re&s;ident at Stockholm, &s;ome warm altercation pa&s;&s;ed: Mr. Burnaby was forbid the court, and publi&s;hed a memorial in his own vindication, while the king of Sweden ju&s;tified his conduct in a re&s;cript &s;ent to all the foreign mini&s;ters. The king of Great-Britain had propo&s;ed a &s;ub&s;idy-treaty to Sweden, which, from the influence of French coun&s;els, was rejected. The Swedes hav|ing a&s;&s;embled a numerous army in Finland, and equipped a large &s;quadron of &s;hips, declared war again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia, upon the mo&s;t trifling pretences; and the fleet putting to &s;ea, commenced ho&s;tilities by blocking up the Ru&s;&s;ian ports in Livonia. A body of eleven thou&s;and Swedes, commanded by general Wrangel, having advanced to Willmen&s;trand, were in Augu&s;t attacked and defeated by general La&s;ci, at the head of thirty thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians. Count Lewenhaupt, who commanded the main army of the Swedes, re&s;olved to take vengeance for this di&s;grace, after the Ru&s;&s;ian troops had retired into winter-quarters. In De|cember he marched towards Wybourg; but, receiving letters from the prince of He&s;&s;e-Homburgh, and the marquis de la Chetardie, the French amba&s;&s;ador at Peter&s;burgh, informing him of the &s;urpri&s;ing revolution which had ju&s;t hap|pened

<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians had been for &s;ome time di&s;contented with their go|vernment. The late czarina was influenced chiefly by German councils, and employed a great number of foreigners in her &s;ervice. The&s;e cau&s;es of di&s;con|tent produced factions and con&s;piracies; and when they were di&s;covered, the empre&s;s treated the authors of them with &s;uch &s;everity as increa&s;ed the ge|neral di&s;affection. Be&s;ides, they were di&s;plea&s;ed at the manner in which &s;he had &s;ettled the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The prince of Brun&s;wic-Lunenburgh-Bevern, father to the young czar, was not at all agreeable to the Ru&s;&s;ian nobility, and his con&s;ort the prince&s;s Anne of Mecklenburgh, having a&s;&s;umed the reins of government during her &s;on's minority, &s;eemed to follow the maxims of her aunt, the late czarina. The Ru&s;&s;ian grandees and generals, therefore, turned their eyes upon the prince&s;s Elizabeth, who was daughter to Peter the Great, and the darling of the empire. The French amba&s;&s;ador gladly concurred in a project for depo&s;ing a prince&s;s who was well affected to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. General La&s;ci ap|proved of the de&s;ign, which was chiefly conducted by the prince of He&s;&s;e-Hom|burgh, who, in the reigns of the empre&s;s Catherine and Peter II. had been ge|nerali&s;&s;imo of the Ru&s;&s;ian army. The good will and concurrence of the troops being &s;ecured, two regiments of guards took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the avenues of the imperial palace at Peter&s;burgh. The prince&s;s Elizabeth, putting her&s;elf at the head of one thou&s;and men, on the fifth day of December entered the winter-palace, where the prince&s;s of Mecklenburg and the infant czar re&s;ided. She ad|vanced into the chamber where the prince&s;s and her con&s;ort lay, and de&s;ired them to ri&s;e and quit the palace, adding, that their per&s;ons were &s;afe; and, that they could not ju&s;tly blame her for a&s;&s;erting her right. At the &s;ame time, the counts O&s;terman, Golofkin, Mingden, and Munich, were arre&s;ted; their papers and effects were &s;eized, and their per&s;ons conveyed to Schli&s;&s;elbourg, a fortre&s;s on the Neva. Early in the morning the &s;enate a&s;&s;embling, declared all that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the reign of Peter II. to be u&s;urpation; and, that the imperial dignity belonged of right to the prince&s;s Elizabeth, who was publicly pro|claimed empre&s;s of all the Ru&s;&s;ias, and immediately recognized by the army in Finland. She forthwith publi&s;hed a general act of indemnity: &s;he created the prince of He&s;&s;e-Homburgh generali&s;&s;imo of her armies: &s;he re&s;tored the Dol|gorucky family to their honours and e&s;tates: &s;he recalled and rewarded all tho&s;e who had been bani&s;hed for favouring her preten&s;ions: &s;he mitigated the exile of the duke of Courland, by indulging him with a maintenance more &s;uitable to his rank: &s;he relea&s;ed general Wrangel, count Wa&s;aburg, and the other Swedi&s;h officers, who had been taken at the battle of Wilman&s;trand; and the prince&s;s Anne of Mecklenburgh, with her con&s;ort and children, were &s;ent under a &s;trong guard, to Riga the capital of Livonia.</P>

<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e tempe&s;ts of wars and revolution, the &s;tates-general wi&s;ely determined to pre&s;erve their own tranquillity. It was doubtle&s;s, their intere&s;t to avoid the dangers and expence of a war, and to profit by that &s;tag|nation of commerce which would nece&s;&s;arily happen among their neighbours that were at open enmity with each other: be&s;ides, they were over-awed by the declarations of the French monarch on one &s;ide; by the power, activity, and pre|ten&s;ions
<PB N="615" REF="6180">
of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty on the other; and they dreaded the pro&s;pect of a &s;tadtholder at the head of their army. The&s;e at lea&s;t were the &s;entiments of many Dutch patriots, reinforced by others that acted under French influence. But, the prince of Orange numbered among his parti&s;ans and adherents many per&s;ons of dignity and credit in the commonwealth; and he was adored by the populace, who loudly exclaimed again&s;t their governors, and clamoured for a war, without cea&s;ing. This national &s;pirit, joined to the remon&s;trances and re|qui&s;itions made by the courts of Vienna and London, obliged the &s;tates to i&s;&s;ue orders for an augmentation of their forces; but the&s;e were executed &s;o &s;lowly, that neither France nor Pru&s;&s;ia had much cau&s;e to take umbrage at their pre|parations. In Italy the king of Sardinia declared for the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria: the republic of Genoa was deeply engaged in the French intere&s;t: the pope, the Vene|tians, and the dukedom of Tu&s;cany were neutral: the king of Naples re&s;olved to &s;upport the claim of his family to the Au&s;trian dominions in Italy, and began to make preparations accordingly. His mother the queen of Spain had formed a plan for erecting the&s;e dominions into a monarchy for her &s;econd &s;on Don Philip; and a body of fifteen thou&s;and men being embarked at Barcelona, were tran&s;ported to Orbitello, under the convoy of the united &s;quadrons of France and Spain. While admiral Haddock, with twelve &s;hips of the line, lay at anchor in the bay of Gibraltar, the Spani&s;h fleet pa&s;&s;ed the Streights in the night, and was joined by the French &s;quadron from Toulon. The Briti&s;h admiral &s;ailing from Gibraltar, fell in with them in a few days, and found both &s;quadrons drawn up in line of battle. As he bore down upon the Spani&s;h fleet, the French admiral &s;ent a flag of truce to inform him, that as the French and Spaniards were engaged in a joint-expedition, he &s;hould be obliged to act in concert with his ma&s;ter's allies. This interpo&s;ition prevented an engagement, the combined fleets amounting to double the number of the Engli&s;h &s;quadron. Admiral Haddock was obliged to de&s;i&s;t; and proceeded to Portmahon, leaving the enemy to pro&s;ecute their voyage without mole&s;tation. The people of England were incen&s;ed at this tran&s;action, and did not &s;cruple to affirm, that the hands of the Briti&s;h admiral were tied up by the neutrality of Hanover <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the month of July two &s;hips of Had|dock's &s;quadron &s;ailing in with three French &s;hips of war, captain Parnet the Engli&s;h com|modore, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be Spani&s;h regi&s;ter &s;hips, fired a &s;hot, in order to bring them to; and they refu&s;ing to comp$y with this &s;ignal, a &s;harp engagement en&s;ued; $word$ they had fought &s;eve|ral hours, the French commander cea&s;ed firing, and thought proper to $ome to an explanation, when he and Barnet parted with mutual apolo|gies.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this year a dangerous con|&s;piracy was di&s;covered at New York in North America.

Fire was &s;et to &s;eve|ral parts of the city; nine or ten negroes were ap|prehended, convicted, and burned alive.

<P>The court of Madrid &s;eemed to have &s;haken off that indolence and phlegm which had formerly di&s;graced the councils of Spain. They no &s;ooner learned the de&s;tination of commodore An&s;on, who had &s;ailed from Spithead in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, than they &s;ent Don Pizzaro, with a more powerful &s;quadron, upon the &s;ame voyage, to defeat his de&s;ign. He accord|ingly &s;teered the &s;ame cour&s;e, and actually fell in with one or two &s;hips of the Briti&s;h armament, near the Streights of Magellan; but he could not weather
<PB N="616" REF="6190">
a long and furious tempe&s;t, through which Mr. An&s;on proceeded into the South-Sea. One of the Spani&s;h &s;hips peri&s;hed at &s;ea; another was wrecked on the coa&s;t of Brazil; and Pizarro bore away for the Rio de la Plata, where he arrived with the three remaining &s;hips, in a &s;hattered condition, after having lo&s;t twelve hundred men by &s;ickne&s;s and famine. The Spaniards exerted the &s;ame vigilance and activity in Europe. Their privateers were &s;o indu&s;trious and &s;ucce&s;sful, that in the beginning of this year, they had taken, &s;ince the commencement of the war, four hundred and &s;even &s;hips, belonging to the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, and valued at near four millions of pia&s;tres. The traders had therefore too much cau&s;e to complain, con&s;idering the formi|dable fleets which were maintained for the protection of commerce. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer, Sir John Norris had twice &s;ailed towards the coa&s;t of Spain, at the he$d of a powerful &s;quadron, without taking any effectual &s;tep for annoying the enemy, as if the &s;ole intention of the mini&s;try had been to ex|po&s;e the nation to the ridicule and contempt of its enemies. The inactivity of the Briti&s;h arms appears the more inexcu&s;able, when we con&s;ider the great armaments which had been prepared. The land-forces of Great-Britain, ex|clu&s;ive of the Dani&s;h and He&s;&s;ian auxiliaries, amounted to &s;ixty thoudand men; and the fleet con&s;i&s;ted of above one hundred &s;hips of war, manned by fifty four thou&s;and &s;ailors.</P>

<P>The general di&s;content of the people had a manife&s;t influence upon the election of members for the new parliament, which produced one of the mo&s;t violent conte&s;ts between the two parties, which had happened &s;ince the revolu|tion. All the adherents of the prince of Wales concurred with the country party, in oppo&s;ition to the mini&s;ter; and the duke of Argyle exerted him&s;elf &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully among the &s;hires and burroughs of Scotland, that the parti&s;ans of the mini&s;try could not &s;ecure &s;ix members out of the whole number returned from North-Britain. They were however much more fortunate in the election of the &s;ixteen peers, who were cho&s;en literally according to the li&s;t tran&s;mitted from court. In&s;tructions were delivered by the con&s;tituents to a great num|ber of members returned for cities and counties, exhorting and requiring them to oppo&s;e a &s;tanding army in time of peace; to vote for the mitigation of ex|ci&s;e laws; for the repeal of &s;eptennial parliaments, for the limitation of place|men in the hou&s;e of commons; and they in&s;i&s;ted upon their examining $nto the particulars of the public expence, and endeavouring to redre&s;s the grievances of the nation. Ob&s;tinate &s;truggles were maintained in all parts of the united kingdom with uncommon ardour and per&s;everance; and &s;uch a national &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition prevailed, that notwith&s;tanding the whole weight of mini&s;terial influence, the contrary intere&s;t &s;eemed to preponderate in the new parliament.</P>

<P>The king returned to England in the month of October; and on the fir&s;t day of December, the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened. Mr. On&s;low being re-cho&s;en &s;peaker, was approved of by his maje&s;ty, who &s;poke in the u&s;ual &s;tile to both hou&s;es. He ob&s;erved, that the former parliament had formed the &s;tronge&s;t re|&s;olutions in favour of the queen of Hungary, for the maintenance of the prag|matic &s;anction: for the pre&s;ervation of the balance of power, and the peace and liberties of Europe; and that, if the other powers which were under the like engagements with him, had an&s;wered the ju&s;t expectations &s;o &s;olemnly given, the &s;upport of the common cau&s;e would have been attended with le&s;s difficulty.
<PB N="617" REF="6200">
He &s;aid, he had endeavoured, by the mo&s;t proper and early applications, to induce other powers that were united with him by the ties of common intere&s;t, to concert &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;o important and critical a conjuncture required: that where an accommodation &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, he had laboured to reconcile princes who&s;e union would have been the mo&s;t effectual means to prevent the mi&s;chiefs which had happened, and the be&s;t &s;ecurity for the intere&s;t and &s;afety of the whole. He owned his endeavours had not hitherto produced the de|&s;ired effect; though he was not without hope, that a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of approaching danger would give a more favourable turn to the councils of other nations. He repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of putting the nation in &s;uch a po&s;ture of defence as would enable him to improve all opportunities of maintaining the liberties of Europe, and defeat any attempts that &s;hould be made again&s;t him and his dominions; and he recommended unanimity, vigour, and di&s;patch. The hou&s;e of commons having appointed their &s;everal committees, the &s;peaker reported the king's &s;peech; and Mr. Herbert moved for an addre&s;s of thanks, including an approbation of the means by which the war had been pro&s;ecuted. The mo|tion being &s;econded by Mr. Trevor, lord Noel Somer&s;et &s;tood up and moved, that the hou&s;e would in their addre&s;s de&s;ire his maje&s;ty, not to engage the&s;e kingdoms in a war for the pre&s;ervation of his foreign dominions. He was &s;upported by that incorruptible patriot Mr. Shippen, who declared, he was nei|ther a&s;hamed nor afraid to affirm, that thirty years had made no change in any of his political opinions. He &s;aid, he was grown old in the hou&s;e of commons; that time had verified the predictions he had formerly uttered; and that he had &s;een his conjectures ripened into knowledge. <Q>&startq;If my country, added he, has been &s;o unfortunate as once more to commit her intere&s;t to men who pro|po&s;e to them&s;elves no advantage from their tru&s;t but that of &s;elling it, I may, perhaps, fall once more under cen&s;ure for declaring my opinion, and be once more treated as a criminal, for a&s;&s;erting what they who puni&s;h me cannot deny; for maintaining, that Hanoverian maxims are incon&s;i&s;tent with the happine&s;s of this nation; and for pre&s;erving the caution &s;o &s;trongly inculcated by tho&s;e patriots who framed the act of &s;ettlement, and conferred upon the pre&s;ent royal family their title to the throne.&endq;</Q> He particulari&s;ed the in&s;tances in which the mini&s;try had acted in diametrical oppo&s;ition to that nece&s;&s;ary con&s;ti|tution; and he in&s;i&s;ted on the nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;ome &s;tep to remove the ap|prehen&s;ions of the people, who began to think them&s;elves in danger of being &s;acrificed to the &s;ecurity of foreign dominions. Mr. Gibbon, who &s;poke on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion, expatiated upon the ab&s;urdity of returning thanks for the pro&s;ecution of a war which had been egregiou&s;ly mi&s;managed. <Q>&startq;What! &s;aid he, are our thanks to be &s;olemnly returned for defeats, di&s;grace, and lo&s;&s;es, the ruin of our merchants, the impri&s;onment of our &s;ailors, idle &s;hows of armaments, and u&s;ele&s;s expences?&endq;</Q> Sir Robert Walpole having made a &s;hort &s;peech in de|fence of the fir&s;t motion for an addre&s;s, was an&s;wered by Mr. Pulteney, who &s;eemed to be animated with a double proportion of patriot indignation. He a&s;&s;erted, that from a review of that mini&s;ter's conduct &s;ince the beginning of the di&s;pute with Spain, it would appear, that he had been guilty not only of &s;ingle errors, but of deliberate treachery: that he had always co-operated with the enemies of his country, and &s;acrificed to his private intere&s;t the happine&s;s and honour of the Briti&s;h nation.

<P>$word$ &s;mall advantage, however, the mini&s;ter did not con&s;ider as a $word$ of $span$ an undoubted majority in the hou&s;e of com|mons.

The incon&s;iderable majority that appeared on the &s;ide of the admini&s;tration, plainly proved, that the influ|ence of the mini&s;ter was greatly dimini&s;hed, and &s;eemed to progno&s;ticate his fur|ther decline. This con&s;ideration induced &s;ome individuals to declare again&s;t him as a &s;etting &s;un, from who&s;e beams they could expect no warmth. His adherents began to tremble; and he him&s;elf had occa&s;ion for all his art and equanimity. The court-intere&s;t was not &s;ufficient to &s;upport the election of their own members for We&s;tmin&s;ter. The high-bailiff had been guilty of &s;ome illegal practices at the poll; and three ju&s;tices of the peace had, on pretence of preventing riots, &s;ent for a military force to overawe the election. A petition pre&s;ented by the electors of We&s;tmin&s;ter was taken into con&s;ideration by the hou&s;e; and the election was declared void by a majority of four voices. The high-bailiff was taken into cu&s;tody; the officer who had ordered the &s;oldiers to march, and the three ju&s;tices who &s;igned the letter, in con&s;equence of which he a$$ed, were re$rimanded on their knees at the bar of the hou&s;e.</P>

this formidable party, revered by the whole nation; a party which had gained the a&s;cendancy in the hou&s;e of commons; which profe&s;&s;ed to act upon the princi|ples of public virtue; which demanded the fall of an odious mini&s;ter, as a &s;a|crifice due to an injured people; and declared, that no temptation could &s;hake their virtue; that no art could di&s;&s;olve the cement by which they were united. Sir Robert Walpole, though repul&s;ed in his attempt upon the prince of Wales, was more &s;ucce&s;sful in his other endeavours. He re&s;olved to try his &s;trength once more in the hou&s;e of commons, in another di&s;puted election; and had the mortification to &s;ee the majority in the oppo&s;ition augmented to &s;ixteen voices. He declared, he would never more &s;it in that hou&s;e; and next day, which was the third of February, the king adjourned both hou&s;es of parliament to the eighteenth day of the &s;ame month.

<P>At no time of his life did he acquit him&s;elf with &s;uch prudential policy as he now di&s;played. He found means to &s;eparate the parts that com|po&s;ed the oppo&s;ition, and to transfer the popular od$$m from him&s;elf to the&s;e who had profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves his keene&s;t adver&s;aries. The country party con|&s;i&s;ted of the Tories, reinforced by di&s;contented Whigs, who had either been di&s;appointed in their own ambitious vie$s, or felt for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their country, occa&s;ioned by a weak and worthle&s;s admini&s;tration. The old patriots and the Whigs whom they had joined, acted upon very different, and indeed, upon oppo&s;ite principles of government; and therefore, they were united only by the ties of convenience. A coalition was propo&s;ed between the di&s;contented Whigs and tho&s;e of the &s;ame denomination who acted in the mini&s;try. Some were gratified with titles and offices; and all were a&s;&s;ured, that in the manage|ment of affairs, a new &s;y&s;tem would be adopted, according to the plan they them&s;elves &s;hould propo&s;e. The court required nothing of them, but that the earl of Orford &s;hould e&s;cape with impunity. His place of chancellor of the exchequer was be&s;towed upon Mr. Sandys, who was likewi&s;e appointed a lord of the trea&s;ury; and the earl of Wilmington &s;ucceeded him as fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of that board. Lord Harrington being dignified with the title of earl, was declared pre&s;ident of the council; and in his room lord Carteret became &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate. The duke of Argyle was made ma&s;ter-general of the ordnance, colonel of his maje&s;ty's royal regiment of hor&s;e-guards, and field-mar&s;hal and com|mander in chief of all the forces in South-Britain; but, finding him&s;elf di&s;ap|pointed in his expectations of the coalition, he, in le&s;s than a month, renounced all the&s;e employments. The marquis of Tweedale was appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate for Scotland, a po&s;t which had been long &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: Mr. Pulteney was &s;worn of the privy-council, and afterwards created earl of Bath. The earl of Winchel&s;ea and Nottingham was preferred to the head of the admiralty, in the room of Sir Charles Wager; and, after the re&s;ignation of the duke of Argyle, the earl of Stair was appointed field-mar&s;hal of all his maje&s;ty's forces, and am|ba&s;&s;ador-extraordinary to the &s;tates-general. On the &s;eventeenth day of Fe|bruary the prince of Wales, attended by a numerous retinue of his adherents, waited on his maje&s;ty, who received him graciou&s;ly, and ordered his guards to be re&s;tored. The lord Carteret and Mr. Sandys were the fir&s;t who embraced the offers of the court, without the con&s;ent or privity of any other leaders in the oppo&s;ition, except that of Mr. Pulteney; but, they declared to their friends,

they would &s;till proceed upon patriot principles: that they would concur in promoting an inquiry into pa&s;t mea&s;ures; and, in enacting nece&s;&s;ary laws to &s;ecure the con&s;titution from the practices of corruption. The&s;e profe&s;&s;ions were believed, not only by their old condjutors in the hou&s;e of commons, but al&s;o by the nation in general. The reconciliation between the king and the prince of Wales, together with the change in the mini&s;try, were celebrated with public rejoi$ings all over the kingdom: and immediately after the adjournment, no|thing but concord appeared in the hou&s;e of commons.</P>

<P>But this harmony was of &s;hort duration.

They branded the new converts as apo&s;tates and betrayers of their country; and, in the tran|&s;ports of their indignation, they entirely overlooked the old object of their re|&s;entment. That a nobleman of pliant principles, narrow fortune, and un|bounded ambition, &s;hould for&s;ake his party for the blandi&s;hments of affluence, power, and authority, will not appear &s;trange to any per&s;on acquainted with the human heart; but, the &s;en&s;ible part of mankind will always reflect with amaze|ment upon the conduct of a man, who &s;eeing him&s;elf idolized by his fellow|citizens, as the fir&s;t and firme&s;t patriot of the kingdom, as one of the mo&s;t &s;hining ornaments of his country, could give up all his popularity, and incur the contempt or dete&s;tation of mankind, for the wretched con&s;ideration of an empty title, without office, influence, or the lea&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial appendage. One cannot without an emotion of grief, contemplate &s;uch an in&s;tance of infatua|tion. One cannot but lament, that &s;uch glory &s;hould have been &s;o weakly for|feited: that &s;uch talents &s;hould have been lo&s;t to the cau&s;e of liberty and virtue. Doubtle&s;s, he flattered him&s;elf with the hope of one day directing the councils of his &s;overeign; but, this was never accompli&s;hed, and he remained a &s;olitary monument of bla&s;ted ambition. Before the change in the mini&s;try, Mr. Pul|teney moved, that the &s;everal papers relating to the conduct of the war which had been layed before the hou&s;e, &s;hould be referred to a &s;elect committee, who &s;hould examine &s;trictly into the particulars, and make a report to the hou&s;e of their remarks and objections. The motion introduced a debate; but, upon a divi&s;ion was rejected by a majority of three voices. Petitions having been pre&s;ented by the merchants of London, Bri&s;tol, Liverpool, Gla&s;gow, and almo&s;t all the trading towns in the kingdom, complaining of the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained by the bad conduct of the war, the hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee, to deliberate on the&s;e remon&s;trances. The articles of the London petition were explained by Mr. Glover, an eminent merchant of that city. Six days were &s;pent in peru&s;ing papers and examining witne&s;&s;es; then the &s;ame gen|tleman &s;ummed up the evidence, and in a pathetic &s;peech endeavoured to de|mon&s;trate, that the commerce of Great-Britain had been expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults and rapine of the Spaniards, not by inattention or accident, but by one uniform and continued de&s;ign.

the hou&s;e; and the commons pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal re&s;olutions, upon which a bill was prepared for the better protecting and &s;ecuring the trade and navigation of the kingdom. It made its way through the lower hou&s;e; but was thrown out by the lords. The pen&s;ion-bill was revived and &s;ent up to the peers, where it was again rejected, lord Carteret voting again&s;t that very mea&s;ure which he had &s;o lately endeavoured to promote. On the ninth day of March the lord Limerick made a motion for appointing a committee, to inquire into the con|duct of affairs for the la&s;t twenty years: he was &s;econded by Sir John St. Aubyn, and &s;upported by Mr. Velters Cornwal, Mr. Philips, Mr. W. Pitt, and lord Percival the new member for We&s;tmin&s;ter, who had already &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his eloquence and capacity. The motion was oppo&s;ed by Sir Charles Wager, Mr. Pelham, and Mr. Henry Fox, &s;urveyor-general to his maje&s;ty's works, and brother to lord Ilche&s;ter. Though the oppo&s;ition was faint and frivolous, the propo&s;al was rejected by a majority of two voices. Lord Limerick, not yet di&s;couraged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The hou&s;e re&s;olved to choo&s;e a &s;ecret committee by ballot; and in the mean time pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, a&s;&s;uring him of their fidelity, zeal, and affection.</P>

<P>Sir Robert God&s;chall having moved for leave to bring in a bill, to repeal the act for &s;eptennial parliaments, he was &s;econded by Sir John Barnard; but warmly oppo&s;ed by Mr. Pulteney and Mr. Sandys; and the que&s;tion pa&s;&s;ed in the negative. The committee of &s;ecrecy being cho&s;en, began to examine evidence, and Mr. Paxton &s;ollicitor to the trea&s;ury, refu&s;ing to an&s;wer &s;uch que&s;tions as were put to him, lord Limerick, chairman of the committee, com|plained to the hou&s;e of his ob&s;tinacy. He was fir&s;t taken into cu&s;tody; and &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in his refu&s;al, committed to Newgate. Then his lord&s;hip moved, that leave &s;hould be given to bring in a bill for indemnifying evidence again&s;t the earl of Orford; and it was actually prepared by a deci&s;ion of the majority. In the hou&s;e of lords it was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by lord Carteret, and as &s;trenu|ou&s;ly &s;upported by the duke of Argyle; but fell upon a divi&s;ion, by the weight of &s;uperior numbers. Tho&s;e members in the hou&s;e of commons who heartily wi&s;hed that the inquiry might be pro&s;ecuted, were extremely incen&s;ed at the fate of this bill. A committee was appointed to &s;earch the journals of the lords for precedents; and their report being read, lord Strange, &s;on of the earl of Derby, moved for a re&s;olution, That the lords refu&s;ing to concur with the com|mons of Great-Britain, in an indemnification nece&s;&s;ary to the effectual carrying on the inquiry now depending in parliament, is an ob&s;truction to ju&s;tice, and may prove fatal to the liberties of this nation. The motion, which was &s;econded by lord Quarendon, &s;on of the earl of Litchfield, gave ri&s;e to a warm de|bate; and Mr. Sandys declaimed again&s;t it as a &s;tep that would bring on an immediate di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent form of government. It is really amazing to &s;ee with what effrontery &s;ome men can &s;hift their maxims, and openly con|tradict the whole tenor of their former conduct. Mr. Sandys did not pa&s;s un|cen&s;ured; he &s;u&s;tained &s;ome &s;evere &s;arca&s;ms on his apo&s;tacy, from Sir John Hynde Cotton, who refuted all his objections: neverthele&s;s, the motion pa&s;&s;ed in the negative. Notwith&s;tanding this great ob&s;truction; purpo&s;ely thrown in
<PB N="622" REF="6250">
the way of the inquiry, the &s;ecret committee di&s;covered many flagrant in&s;tances of fraud and corruption in which the earl of Orford had been concerned. It appeared, that he had granted fraudelent contracts for paying the troops in the We&s;t-Indies: that he had employed iniquitous arts to influence elections: that for &s;ecret-&s;ervice during the la&s;t ten years, he had touched one million four hundred fifty-three thou&s;and four hundred pounds of the public money: that above fifty thou&s;and pounds of this &s;um had been payed to authors and printers of news-papers and political tracts, written in defence of the mini&s;try: that on the very day which preceded his re&s;ignation, he had &s;igned orders on the civil|li&s;t revenues for above thirty thou&s;and pounds: that as the ca&s;h remaining in the exchequer, did not much exc$$d fourteen thou&s;and pounds, he had rai&s;ed the remaining part of the thirty thou&s;and, by pawning the orders to a banker. The committee proceeded to make further progre&s;s in their &s;crutiny, and had almo&s;t prepared a third report, when they were interrupted by the prorogation of parliament</P>

<P>The mini&s;try finding it was nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome &s;tep for con|ciliating the affection of the people, gave way to a bill for excluding certain officers from &s;eats in the hou&s;e of commons. They pa&s;&s;ed another for en|couraging the linen manufacture; another for regulating the trade of the plan|tations; and a third to prevent the marriage of lunatics. They voted forty thou&s;and &s;eamen, and &s;ixty-two thou&s;and five hundred landmen for the &s;ervice of the current year. They provided for the &s;ub&s;idies to Denmark and He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, and voted five hundred thou&s;and pounds to the queen of Hungary. The expence of the year amounted to near &s;ix millions, rai&s;ed by the land-tax at four &s;hillings in the pound, the malt tax, one million from the &s;inking fund, annuities granted upon it for eight hundred thou&s;and pounds, and a loan of one million &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds from the bank. In the month of July, John lord Gower was appointed keeper of his maje&s;ty's privy-&s;eal; Allen lord Bathur&s;t was made captain of the bank of pen&s;ioners; on the fif|teenth day of the month, Mr. Pulteney took his flat in the hou&s;e of peers, as earl of Bath. The king clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion in the u&s;ual way, after having given them to under&s;tand, that a treaty of peace was concluded between the queen of Hungary and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, under his mediation; and that the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Au&s;trian arms were in a great mea&s;ure owing to the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance afforded by the Briti&s;h nation.</P>

<P>By this time great changes had happened in the affairs of the con|tinent. The elector of Bavaria was cho&s;en emperor of Germany at Franck|fort on the Maine, and crowned by the name of Charles VII. on the twelfth day of February. Thither the imperial diet was removed from Rati&s;bon: they confirmed his election, and indulged him with a &s;ub&s;idy of fifty Roman months, amounting to about two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. In the mean time, the Au&s;trian general Khevenhuller ravaged his electorate, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Munich, the capital of Bavaria: he likewi&s;e laid part of the Palatinate under contribution, in re&s;entment for that elector's having &s;ent a body of his troops to reinforce the Imperial army. In March, count Saxe, with a detachment of French and Bavarians, reduced Egra; and the Au&s;trians were obliged to evacuate Bavaria, though they afterwards returned.

to Dingle&s;ing on the I&s;er, to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy, who were now become extremely formidable. In May, a detachment of French and Ba|rians advanced to the ca&s;tle of Hilker&s;bergh on the Danube, with a view to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a bridge over the river: the Au&s;trian garri&s;on immediately marched out to give them battle, and a &s;evere action en&s;ued, in which the Im|periali&s;ts were defcated.</P>

<P>In the beginning of the year, the queen of Hungary had a&s;&s;embled two con&s;iderable armies in Moravia and Bohemia. Prince Charles of Lorrain, at the head of fifty thou&s;and men, advanced again&s;t the Saxons and Pru&s;&s;ians, who thought proper to retire with precipitation from Moravia, which they had invaded. Then the prince took the route to Bohemia; and mar&s;hal Broglio, who commanded the French forces in that country, mu&s;t have fallen a &s;acri|fice, had not the king of Pru&s;&s;ia received a &s;trong reinforcement, and entered that kingdom before his allies could be attacked. The two armies advanced towards each other; and, on the &s;eventeenth of May, joined battle at Cza&s;|law, where the Au&s;trians at fir&s;t gained a manife&s;t advantage, and penetrated as far as the Pru&s;&s;ian baggage; then the irregulars began to plunder &s;o eagerly, that they neglected every other con&s;ideration. The Pru&s;&s;ian in&s;antry took this oppor|tunity to rally; the battle was renewed, and, after a very ob&s;tinate conte&s;t, the victory was &s;natched out of the hands of the Au&s;trians, who were obliged to retire with the lo&s;s of five thou&s;and men killed, and twelve hundred taken by the enemy. The Pru&s;&s;ians paid dear for the honour of remaining on the field of battle; and from the circum&s;tances of this action, the king is &s;aid to have con|ceived a di&s;gu&s;t to the war. When the Au&s;trians made &s;uch progre&s;s in the beginning of the engagement, he rode off with great expedition, until he was recalled by a me&s;&s;age from his general the count de Schwerin, a&s;&s;uring his ma|je&s;ty that there was no danger of a defeat. Immediately after this battle, he di&s;covered an inclination to accommodate all differences with the queen of Hungary. The earl of Hyndford, amba&s;&s;ador from the court of Great-Bri|tain, who accompanied him in this campaign, and was ve&s;ted with full powers by her Hungarian maje&s;ty, did not fail to cultivate this favourable di&s;po&s;ition; and on the fir&s;t day of June, a treaty of peace between the two powers was concluded at Bre&s;lau. The queen ceded to his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, the Upper and Lower Sile&s;ia, with the county of Glatz in Bohemia; and he charged him&s;elf with the payment of the &s;um lent by the merchants of London to the late em|peror, on the Sile$i$n revenues. He likewi&s;e engaged to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neu|trality during the war, and to withdraw his forces from Bohemia in fifteen days after the r$$ification of the treaty, in which were comprehended the king of Great-Britain elector of Hanover, the Czarina, the king of Denmark, the &s;tates general, the hou&s;e of Wol&s;enbuttle, and the king of Poland elector of Saxony, on certain conditions, which were accepted.</P>

<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, recalled his troops; while mar&s;hal Broglio, who commanded the French auxiliaries in that kingdom, and the count de Bel|lei&s;le, abandoned their magazines and baggage, and retired with precipitation un|der the cannon of Prague. There they intrenched them&s;elves in an advanta|geous &s;ituation; and prince Charles being joined by the other body of Au&s;tri|ans under prince Lobkowitz, encamped in &s;ight of them, on the hills of Giri&s;|nitz. The grand duke of Tu&s;cany arrived in the Au&s;trian army, of which he
<PB N="624" REF="6270">
took the command; and the French generals offered to &s;urrender Prague, Egra, and all the other places they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Bohemia, provided they might be al|lowed to march off with their arms, artillery, and baggage. The propo&s;al was rejected, and Prague inve&s;ted on all &s;ides about the end of July. Though the operations of the &s;iege were carried on in an aukward and &s;lovenly manner, the place was &s;o effectually blocked up, that famine mu&s;t have compelled the French to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, had not very extraordinary efforts been made for their relief. The emperor had made advances to the queen of Hungary. He promi&s;ed that the French forces &s;hould quit Bohemia, and evacuate the em|pire; and he offered to renounce all preten&s;ions to the kingdom of Bohemia, on condition that the Au&s;trians would re&s;tore Bavaria: but the&s;e conditions were declined by the court of Vienna. The king of France was no &s;ooner ap|pri&s;ed of the condition to which the generals Broglio and Bellei&s;le were re|duced, than he &s;ent orders to mar&s;hal Maillebois, who commanded his army on the Rhine, to march to their relief. His troops were immediately put in motion; and when they reached Amberg in the Upper Palatinate, joined by the French and Imperiali&s;ts from Bavaria. Prince Charles of Lorrain having received intelligence of their junction and de&s;ign, left eighteen thou&s;and men to maintain the blockade of Prague, under the command of general Fe&s;tititz, while he him&s;elf, with the re&s;t of his army, advanced to Haydon on the frontiers of Bohemia, where he was joined by count Khevenhuller, who had followed the enemy from Bavaria, now commanded by count Seckendorff, and the count de Saxe. Seckendorff, however, was &s;ent back to Bavaria, while mar&s;hal Maillebois entered Bohemia on the twenty-fifth day of September. But, he marched with &s;uch precaution, that prince Charles could not bring him to an engagement. Mean while Fe&s;tititz, for want of a &s;ufficient force, was obliged to abandon the blockade of Prague; and the French generals being now at li|berty, took po&s;t at Leutmaritz. Maillebois advanced as far as Kadan; but, &s;eeing the Au&s;trians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, he marched back to the Palatinate, and was mi&s;erably harra&s;&s;ed in his retreat by prince Charles, who had left a &s;trong body with prince Lobkowitz, to watch the mo|tions of B$llei&s;le and Broglio.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e generals &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;urrounded on all hands, re|turned to Prague, from whence Broglio made his e&s;cape in the habit of a cou|rier, and was &s;ent to command the army of Maillebois, who was by this time di&s;graced. Prince Lobkowitz, who now directed the blockade of Prague, had &s;o effectually cut off all communication between that place and the adjacent country, that in a little time the French troops were reduced to great extremity, both from the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on, and the want of provi&s;ion. They were already reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of eating hor&s;e-fle&s;h$ and unclean animals$ and they had no other pro&s;pect but that of peri&s;hing by famine or war; when their commander formed the &s;cheme of a retreat, which was actually put in execu|tion. Having taken &s;ome artful precautions to deceive the enemy, he, in the middle of December, departed from Prague at midnight, with about fourteen thou&s;and men, thirty pieces of artillery, and &s;ome of the principal citizens as ho&s;tages for the &s;afety of nine hundred &s;oldiers whom he had left in garri&s;on. Notwith&s;tanding the difficulties he mu&s;t have encountered at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, in a broken and unfrequented road, which he purpo&s;ely cho&s;e, he
<PB N="625" REF="6280">
marched with &s;uch expedition, that he had gained the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, before he was overtaken by the hor&s;e and hu&s;&s;ars of prince Lobkowitz. The fatigue and hard&s;hips which the mi&s;erable &s;oldiers underwent, are inexpre&s;&s;ible. A great number peri&s;hed in the &s;now, and many hundreds fainting with wearine&s;s, cold, and hunger, were left to the mercy of the Au&s;trian irregulars, con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t barbarous people on the face of the earth. The count de Bellei&s;le, though tortured with the hip-gout, behaved with &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;o|lution and activity. He cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be carried in a litter to every place where he thought his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary, and made &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, that the pur&s;uers never could make an impre&s;&s;ion upon the body of his troops: but all his artillery, baggage, and even his own equipage, fell into the hands of the enemy. On the twenty-ninth day of December, he arrived at Egra, from whence he proceeded to Al&s;ace without further mole&s;tation: but, when he returned to Ver&s;ailles, he met with a very cold reception, notwith&s;tanding the gallant exploit which he had performed. After his e&s;cape, prince Lobkowitz returned to Prague, and the &s;mall garri&s;on which Bellei&s;le had left &s;urren|dered upon honourable terms; &s;o that this capital reverted to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>

<P>The king of Great-Britain re&s;olving to make a powerful diver|&s;ion in the Netherlands, had, in the month of April, ordered &s;ixteen thou&s;and effective men to be embarked for that country: but, as this &s;tep was taken without any previous concert with the &s;tates-general, the earl of Stair de&s;tined to the command of the forces in Flanders, was in the mean time appointed amba&s;&s;ador-extraordinary and plenipotentiary to their high-mightine&s;&s;es, in or|der to per&s;uade them to co-operate vigorou&s;ly in the plan which his Britannic maje&s;ty had formed. A plan by which Great Britain was engaged as a princi|pal in a foreign di&s;pute, and intailed upon her&s;elf the whole burden of an expen&s;ive war, big with ruin and di&s;grace. England, from being the umpire, was now become a party in all continental quarrels; and in&s;tead of trimming the balance of Europe, lavi&s;hed away her blood and trea&s;ure, in &s;upporting the intere&s;t and allies of a puny electorate in the north of Germany. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia had been at variance with the elector of Hanover. The dutchy of Mec|klenburg was the avowed &s;ubject of di&s;pute; but his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty is &s;aid to have had other more provoking cau&s;es of complaint, which, however, he did not think proper to divulge. The king of Great-Britain found it convenient to accommodate the&s;e differences. In the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer, the two powers concluded a convention, in con&s;equence of which, the troops of Ha|nover evacuated Mecklenburg; and three regiments of Brandenburg took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e bailiwicks that were mortgaged to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The electorate of Hanover being now &s;ecured from danger, &s;ixteen thou&s;and troops of that country, together with the &s;ix thou&s;and auxiliary$ He&s;&s;ians, began their march for the Netherlands; and about the middle of October arrived in the neighbourhood of Bru&s;&s;els, where they encamped. The earl of Stair repaired to Ghent, where the Briti&s;h forces were quartered: a body of Au&s;trians was a&s;|&s;embled; and though the &s;ea&s;on was far advanced, he &s;eemed determined upon &s;ome expedition: but all of a &s;udden, the troops were &s;ent into winter-quarters. The Au&s;trians retired to Luxemburg; the Engli&s;h and He&s;&s;ians remained in
<PB N="626" REF="6290">
Flanders; and the Hanoverians marched into the county of Liege, without paying any regard to the bi&s;hop's prote&s;tation.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;tates-general had made a con&s;iderable augmentation of their forces by &s;ea and land; but, notwith&s;tand ng the repeated in&s;tances of the earl of Stair, they re&s;olved to $dhere to their neutrality: they dreaded the neigh|bourhood of the French; and they were far from being plea&s;ed to &s;ee the Engli&s;h get footing in the Netherlands. The friends of the hou&s;e of Orange begin to exert them&s;elves: the &s;tates of Groningen and We&s;t-Frie&s;land, pro|te&s;ted, in favour of the prince, again&s;t the promotion of foreign generals, which had lately been made: but his intere&s;t was powerfully oppo&s;ed by the provinces of Zealand and Holland, which had the greate&s;t weight in the republic. The revolution in Ru&s;&s;ia did not put an end to the war with Sweden. The&s;e two powers had agreed to an armi&s;tice of three months, during which the czarina augmented her forces in Finland. She likewi&s;e ordered the counts O&s;terman and Munich, with their adherents, to be tried: they were condemned to death, but pardoned on the &s;caffold, and &s;ent in exile to Siberia. The Swedes &s;till encouraged by the intrigues of France, refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to any terms of accom|modation, unle&s;s Carelia, and the other conque&s;ts of the czar Peter &s;hould be re|&s;tored. The French court had expected to bring over the new empre&s;s to their mea&s;ures; but they found her as well di&s;po&s;ed as her predece&s;&s;or, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. She remitted a con&s;iderable &s;um of money to the queen of Hungary; and at the &s;ame time congratulated the elector of Bavaria on his ele|vation to the imperial throne. The ceremony of her coronation was performed in May, with great &s;olemnity at Mo&s;cow; and in November, &s;he declared her nephew the duke of Hol&s;tein-Gottorp her &s;ucce&s;&s;or, by the title of grand prince of all the Ru&s;&s;ias. The ce&s;&s;ation of arms being expired, general La&s;cy reduced Frederick&s;heim, and obliged the Swedi&s;h army, commanded by count Lewenhaupt, to retire before him, from one place to another, until at length they were quite &s;urrounded near Hel&s;ingfors. In this emergency, the Swedi&s;h general &s;ubmitted to a capitulation, by which his infantry were tran&s;ported by &s;ea to Sweden; his cavalry marched by land to Abo, and his artillery and ma|gazines remained in the hands of the Ru&s;&s;ians. The king of Sweden being of an advanced age, the diet a&s;&s;embled in order to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;on; and the duke of Hol&s;tein-Gottorp, as grand&s;on to the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter of Charles XII. was declared next heir to the crown. A courier was immediately di&s;patched to Mo&s;|cow, to notify to the duke this determination of the diet; and this me&s;&s;age was followed by a deputation: but, when they under&s;tood that he had embraced the religion of the Greek church, and been acknowledged &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the throne of Ru&s;&s;ia, they annulled his election for Sweden, and re&s;olved that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould not be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, until a peace &s;hould be concluded with the czarina. Conferences were opened at Abo for this purpo&s;e. In the mean time, the events of war had been &s;o long unfortunate for Sweden, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to appea&s;e the indignation of the people with &s;ome &s;a|crifice. The generals Lewenhaupt and Bodenbrock were tried by a court-martial for mi&s;conduct: and being found guilty and condemned to death, they appealed to the diet, by which the &s;entence was confirmed. The term of the &s;ub&s;idy|treaty between Great-Britain and Denmark expiring, his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty re|fu&s;ed
<PB N="627" REF="6300">
to renew it; nor would he accede to the peace of Bre&s;lau. On the other hand, he became &s;ub&s;idiary to France, with which al&s;o he concluded a new treaty of commerce.</P>

<P>The court of Ver&s;ailles were now heartily tired of maintaining the war in Germany, and had actually made equitable propo&s;als of peace to the queen of Hungary, by whom they were rejected. Thus repul&s;ed, they redoubled their preparations; and endeavoured, by advantageous offers, to detach the king of Sardinia from the intere&s;t of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. This prince had e&s;pou&s;ed a &s;i&s;ter of the grand duke, who pre&s;&s;ed him to declare for her brother, and the queen of Hungary promi&s;ed to gratify him with &s;ome territories in the Mila|ne&s;e; be&s;ides, he thought the Spaniards had already gained too much ground in Italy: but, at the &s;ame time, he was afraid of being cru&s;hed between France and Spain, before he could be properly &s;upported. He therefore tem|pori&s;ed, and protracted the negotiation, until he was alarmed at the progre&s;s of the Spani&s;h arms in Italy, and fixed in his determination by the &s;ub&s;idies of Great-Britain. The Spani&s;h army a&s;&s;embled at Rimini, under the duke de Montemar; and being joined by the Neapolitan forces, amounted to &s;ixty thou|&s;and men, furni&s;hed with a large train of artillery. About the beginning of May, they entered the Bologne&s;e: then the king of Sardinia declaring again&s;t them, joined the Au&s;trian army commanded by count Traun, marched into the dutchy of Parma; and under&s;tanding that the duke of Modena had engaged in a treaty with the Spaniards, he di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that prince of his dominions. The duke de Montemar &s;eeing his army dimini&s;hed by &s;ickne&s;s and de&s;ertion, retreated to the kingdom of Naples, and was followed by the king of Sardinia, as far as Rimini.</P>

He forthwith began his march for Piedmont. Don Philip abandoned Savoy at his approach, and retreating into Dauphin&eacute;, took po&s;t under the cannon of fort Barreaux. The king pur&s;ued him thither, and both armies remained in &s;ight of each other till the month of December, when the marquis de Minas, an active and enter|pri&s;ing general, arrived from Madrid, and took upon him the command of the forces under Do# Philip. His fir&s;t exploit was again&s;t the ca&s;tle of A&s;pre|mont, in the neighbourhood of the Sardinian camp. He attacked it &s;o vigo|rou&s;ly that the garri&s;on was obliged to capitulate in four and forty hours. The lo&s;s of this important po&s;t compelled the king to retire into Piedmont, and the Spaniards marched back into Savoy, where they e&s;tabli&s;hed their winter-quarters. In the mean time the duke de Montemar, who directed the other Spani&s;h army, though the duke of Modena was nominal generali&s;&s;imo, re&s;igned his command to count Gages, who attempted to penetrate into Tu&s;cany; but was pre|vented by the vigilance of count Traun the Au&s;trian general. In December he quartered his troops in the Bologne&s;e and Romagna; while the Au&s;trians and Piedmonte&s;e, were di&s;tributed in the Modene&s;e and Parme&s;an. The pope was pa&s;&s;ive during the whole campaign; the Venetians maintained their neutrality; and the king of the two Sicilies was overawed by the Briti&s;h fleet in the Medi|terranean.</P>

<P>The new mini&s;try in England had &s;ent out admiral Matthews to a&s;&s;ume the command of this &s;quadron, which $word$ been for &s;ome time conducted by Le&s;tock, an inferior officer, as Haddock had $span$ obliged to re&s;ign his com|mi&s;&s;ion on account of his ill &s;tate of health. M$tthews was likewi&s;e inve&s;ted with the character of mini&s;ter$plenipotentiary to the king of Sardinia and the &s;tates of Italy. Immediately after he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his command, he ordered captain Norris to de&s;troy five Spani&s;h gallies which had put into the bay of St. Tropez; and this &s;ervice was effectually performed. In May he detached commodore Rowley with eight &s;ail, to crui&s;e off the harbour of Toulon; and a great number of merchant$&s;hips belonging to the enemy fell into his hands. In Augu&s;t he &s;ent commodore Martin with another &s;quadron into the bay of Naples, to bombard that city, unle&s;s his Sicilian maje&s;ty would imme|diately recal his troops which had joined the Spani&s;h army, and promi&s;e to re|main neuter during the continuance of the war. Naples was immediately filled with con&s;ternation: the king &s;ub&s;cribed to the&s;e conditions; and the Engli&s;h &s;quadron rejoined the admiral in the road of Hieres, which he had cho&s;en for his winter-&s;tation. But before this period he had landed &s;ome men at St. Remo, in the territories of Genoa, and de&s;troyed the magazines that were erected for the u&s;e of the Spani&s;h army. He had likewi&s;e ordered two of his crui&s;ers to attack a Spani&s;h &s;hip of the line which lay at anchor in the port of Ajaccio, in the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica; but, the Spani&s;h captain &s;et his men on &s;hore, and blew up his &s;hip, rather than &s;he &s;hould fall into the hands of the Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year admiral Vernon and general Went|worth made another effort in the We&s;t-Indies. They had received in January a reinforcement from England, and planned a new expedition, in concert with the governor of Jamaica, who accompanied them in the voyage. Their de&s;ign was to di&s;embark the troops at Porto-Bello, and march acro&s;s the i&s;thmus of Darien, to attack the rich town of Panama. They &s;ailed from Jamaica on the ninth day of March, and on the twenty-eighth arrived at Porto-Bello. There they held a council of war, in which it was re&s;olved, that as the troops were &s;ickly, the rainy &s;ea&s;on begun, and &s;everal tran&s;ports not yet ar|rived, the intended expedition was become impracticable. In pur&s;uance of this determination the armament immediately returned to Jamaica, exhibiting a ridiculous &s;pectacle of folly and irre&s;olution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In May two Engli&s;h frigates, commanded by captain Smith and captain Stuart, fell in with three Spani&s;h &s;hips of War, near the i&s;land of St. $word$ They forthwith engaged, and the action continued till night, by the favour of which the enemy retired to Porto-Rico in a &s;hattered condition.</P>
<P>In the mouth of September the Tilbury &s;hip of war of &s;ixty guns was accidentally &s;et on fire, and de&s;troyed, off the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola: on which occa&s;ion one hundred and twenty-&s;even men pe|ri&s;hed; the re&s;t were &s;aved by captain Hoare of the Defiance, who happened to be on the &s;ame cru$$e.</P></NOTE>. In Augu&s;t a &s;hip of war was &s;ent from thence, with about three hundred &s;oldiers, to the &s;mall i&s;land Rattan, in the bay of Honduras, of which they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In September Vern&oacute;n and Wentworth received orders to return to England with &s;uch troops as re|mained alive; and the&s;e did not amount to a tenth part of the number which had been &s;ent abroad in that inglorious &s;ervice. The inferior officers fell ignobly by &s;ickne&s;s and de&s;pair, without an opportunity of &s;ignalizing their cou|rage,

and the commanders lived to feel the &s;corn and reproach of their country. In the month of June the new colony of Georgia was invaded by an armament from St. Augu&s;tine, commanded by Don Marinel de Monteano, governor of that fortre&s;s. It con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix and thirty &s;hips, from which four thou&s;and men were landed at St. Simon's; and began their march for Frederica. Ge|neral Oglethorpe, with a handful of men, took &s;uch wi&s;e precautions for oppo&s;|ing their progre&s;s, and harra&s;&s;ed them in their march with &s;uch activity and re&s;olution, that after two of their detachments had been defeated, they retired to their &s;hips, and totally abandoned the enterprize.</P>

<P>In England the merchants &s;till complained, that their commerce was not properly protected, and the people clamoured again&s;t the conduct of the war. They &s;aid, their burthens were increa&s;ed to maintain quarrels with which they had no concern; to defray the enormous expence of inactive fleets and pacific armies. The lord C. had now in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the confidence of his &s;overeign, and engro&s;&s;ed the whole direction of public affairs. The war with Spain was now become a &s;econdary con&s;ideration, and neglected accordingly; while the chief attention of the new mini&s;ter was turned upon the affairs of the continent. The di&s;pute with Spain concerned Britain only. The intere&s;ts of Hanover were connected with the troubles of the empire. By pur&s;uing this object he &s;oothed the wi&s;hes of his ma&s;ter, and opened a more ample field for his own ambition. He had &s;tudied the policy of the continent with peculiar eagerne&s;s. This was the favourite &s;ubject of his reflection, upon which he thought and &s;poke with a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m. The intolerable taxes, the po|verty, the ruined commerce of his country, the iniquity of &s;tanding armies, votes of credit, and foreign connexions, upon which he had &s;o often expatiated, were now forgotten, or overlooked. He &s;aw nothing but glory, conque&s;t, and acquired dominion. He &s;et the power of France at defiance; and, as if Great-Britain had felt no di&s;tre&s;s, but teemed with trea&s;ure which &s;he could not otherwi&s;e employ, he poured forth her millions with a ra&s;h and de&s;perate hand, in purcha&s;ing beggarly allies and maintaining mercenary armies. The earl of Stair had arrived in England towards the end of Augu&s;t, and conferred with his maje&s;ty. A privy-council was &s;ummoned; and in a few days that nobleman returned to Holland. The lord Carteret was &s;ent with a commi&s;&s;ion to the Hague in September; and when he returned, the baggage of the king and the duke of Cumberland, which had been &s;hipped for Flanders, was ordered to be brought on &s;hore. The parliament met on the &s;ixteenth day of November, when his maje&s;ty told them, that he had augmented the Briti&s;h forces in the Low-Countries with &s;ixteen thou&s;and Hanoverians and the He&s;&s;ian auxiliaries, in order to form &s;uch a force, in conjunction with the Au&s;trian troops, as might be of &s;ervice to the common cau&s;e in all events. He extolled the magnanimity and fortitude of the queen of Hungary, as well as the re&s;olute conduct of the king of Sardinia, and his &s;trict adherence to his engagements, though attacked in his own domi|nions. He mentioned the requi&s;ition made by Sweden, of his good offices for procuring a peace between that nation and Ru&s;&s;ia; the defen&s;ive alliances which he had concluded with the czarina, and with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, as events which could not have been expected if Great-Britain had not manife&s;ted a &s;ea|&s;onable &s;pirit and vigour, in defence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her ancient allies, and in maintaining the liberties of Europe. He &s;aid, the honour and intere&s;t of
<PB N="630" REF="6330">
his crown and kingdoms, the &s;ucce&s;s of the war with Spain, the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the ballance and tranquillity of Europe, would greatly depend on the prudence and vigour of their re&s;olutions. The marquis of Tweedale moved for an addre&s;s of thanks, which was oppo&s;ed by the earl of Che&s;terfield, for the rea&s;ons &s;o often urged on the &s;ame occa&s;ion; but &s;upported by the lord C. on his new-adopted maxims, with tho&s;e &s;pecious arguments which he could at all times produce, delivered with amazing &s;erenity and a&s;&s;urance. The motion was adopted, and the addre&s;s pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty. About this period a treaty of mutual defence and guarantee between his maje&s;ty and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, was &s;igned at We&s;tmin&s;ter. In the hou&s;e of commons Mr. Lyttleton made a motion for reviving the place-bill; but it was oppo&s;ed by a great num|ber of members who had formerly been &s;trenuous advocates for this mea&s;ure, and rejected upon a divi&s;ion. This was al&s;o the fate of a motion made to renew the inquiry into the conduct of Robert earl of Orford. As many &s;trong pre&s;umptions of guilt had appeared again&s;t him in the reports of the &s;e|cret committee, the nation had rea&s;on to expect that this propo&s;al would have been embraced by a great majority; but, &s;everal members, who in the preced|ing &s;e&s;&s;ion had been loud in their demands of ju&s;tice, now &s;hamefully contri|buted in &s;tifling the inquiry.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>When the hou&s;e of lords took into con&s;ideration the &s;everal e&s;ti|mates of the expence occa&s;ioned by the forces in the pay of Great-Britain, earl Stanhope, at the clo&s;e of an elegant &s;peech, moved for an addre&s;s to be&s;eech and advi&s;e his maje&s;ty, that in compa&s;&s;ion to his people, loaded already with &s;uch numerous and heavy taxes, &s;uch large and growing debts, and greater annual expences than the nation at any time before had ever &s;u&s;tained, he would exo|nerate his &s;ubjects of the charge and burthen of tho&s;e mercenaries who were taken into the &s;ervice la&s;t year, without the advice or con&s;ent of parliament. The motion was &s;upported by the earl of Sandwich, who took occa&s;ion to &s;peak with great contempt of Hanover, and in mentioning the royal family, &s;eemed to forget that decorum which the &s;ubject required. He had indeed rea&s;on to talk with a&s;perity on the contract by which the Hanoverians had been taken into the pay of Great-Britain. Levy-money was charged to the account, though they were engaged for one year only; and though not a &s;ingle regiment had been rai&s;ed on this occa&s;ion: they had been levied for the &s;ecurity of the electorate; and would have been maintained if England had never engaged in the affairs of the continent. The duke of Bedford enlarged upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. He &s;aid, it had been &s;u&s;pected, nor was the &s;u&s;picion without foundation, that the mea|&s;ures of the Engli&s;h mini&s;try had long been regulated by the intere&s;t of his ma|je&s;ty's electoral territories: that the&s;e had been long con&s;idered as a gulph into which the trea&s;ures of Great-Britain had been thrown: that the &s;tate of Hanover had been changed without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e, &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of its princes to the throne of England: affluence had begun to wanton in their towns, and gold to glitter in their cottages, without the di&s;covery of mines, or the increa&s;e of their commerce; and new dominions had been purcha&s;ed, of which the value was never payed from the revenues of Hanover. The motion was hunted down by the new mini&s;ter, the patriot lord Bathur&s;t, and the earl of Bath, which la&s;t nobleman declared, that he con&s;idered it as an act of cowardice and meanne&s;s, to fall pa&s;&s;ively down the &s;tream of popularity, to &s;uffer his rea&s;on and
<PB N="631" REF="6340">
integrity to be overborne by the noi&s;e of vulgar clamours, which had been rai&s;ed again&s;t the mea&s;ures of the government by the low arts of exaggeration, fallacious rea&s;onings, and partial repre&s;entations. This is the very language which Sir Robert Walpole had often u&s;ed again&s;t Mr. Pulteney and his confede|rates in the hou&s;e of commons. The a&s;&s;ociates of the new &s;ecretary pleaded the cau&s;e of Hanover, and in&s;i&s;ted upon the nece&s;&s;ity of a land-war again&s;t France, with all the vehemence of declamation. Their &s;ugge&s;tions were an&s;wered; their conduct was &s;everely &s;tigmatized by the earl of Che&s;terfield, who ob&s;erved, that the a&s;&s;embling an army in Flanders, without the concurrence of the &s;tates-general, or any other power engaged by treaty, or bound by intere&s;t, to &s;up|port the queen of Hungary, was a ra&s;h and ridiculous mea&s;ure: that the taking &s;ixteen thou&s;and Hanoverians into Briti&s;h pay, without con&s;ulting the parlia|ment, &s;eemed highly derogatory to the rights and dignity of the great council of the nation, and a very dangerous precedent to future times: that the&s;e troops could not be employed again&s;t the emperor, whom they had already recognized: that the arms and wealth of Britain alone were altogether in&s;ufficient to rai&s;e the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria to its former &s;trength, dominion, and influence: that the a&s;&s;embling an army in Flanders would engage the nation as principals in an expen&s;ive and ruinous war, with a power which it ought not to provoke, and could not pretend to with&s;tand in that manner: that while Great Britain ex|hau&s;ted her&s;elf almo&s;t to ruin, in pur&s;uance of &s;chemes founded on engage|ments to the queen of Hungary, the electorate of Hanover, though under the &s;ame engagements, and governed by the &s;ame prince, did not appear to con|tribute any thing as an ally to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but was payed by Great-Britain for all the forces it had &s;ent into the field, at a very exorbitant price: that no|thing could be more ab&s;urd and iniquitous than to hire the&s;e mercenaries, while a numerous army lay inactive at home; and the nation groaned under &s;uch intolera|ble burthens. <Q>&startq;It may be proper, added he, to repeat what may be forgotten in the multitude of other objects, that this nation, after having exalted the elector of Hanover from a &s;tate of ob&s;curity to the crown, is condemned to hire the troops of that electorate to fight their own cau&s;e; to hire them at a rate which was never demanded before, and to pay levy-money for them, though it is known to all Europe, that they were not rai&s;ed for this occa&s;ion.&endq;</Q> All the parti&s;ans of the old mini&s;try joined in the oppo&s;ition to earl Stanhope's motion, which was rejected by the majority. Then the earl of Scarborough moved for an addre&s;s, to approve of the mea&s;ures which had been taken on the continent; and this was likewi&s;e carried by dint of number. It was not, however, a very eligible victory: what they gained in the parliament they lo&s;t with the people. The new mini&s;ters became more odious than their predece&s;&s;ors; and people began to think that public virtue was an empty name.</P>

<P>But the mo&s;t &s;evere oppo&s;ition they underwent, was in their endea|vours to &s;upport a bill which they had concerted, and which had pa&s;&s;ed through the hou&s;e of commons with great precipitation: it repealed certain duties on &s;piri|tuous liquors, and lincences for retailing the&s;e liquors; and impo&s;ed others at an ea&s;ier rate. When tho&s;e &s;evere duties, amounting almo&s;t to a prohibition, were impo&s;ed, the populace of London were &s;unk into the mo&s;t brutal degeneracy, by drinking to exce&s;s the pernicious &s;pirit called Gin, which was &s;old &s;o cheap, that the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of the people could afford to indulge them&s;elves in one
<PB N="632" REF="6350">
continued &s;tate of intoxication; to the de&s;truction of all morals, indu&s;try, and order. Such a &s;hameful degree of profligacy prevailed, that the retailers of this poi&s;onous compound &s;et up painted boards in public, inviting people to be drunk for the &s;mall expence of one penny; a&s;&s;uring them, they might be dead drunk for two-pence, and have &s;traw for nothing. They accordingly pro|vided cellars and places &s;trewed with &s;traw, to which they conveyed tho&s;e wretches who were overwhelmed with intoxication. In the&s;e di&s;mal caverns they lay until they recovered &s;ome u&s;e of their faculties, and then they had re|cour&s;e to the &s;ame mi&s;chievous potion; thus con&s;uming their health, and ruin|ing their families in hideous receptacles of the mo&s;t filthy vice, refounding with riot, execration, and bla&s;phemy. Such bea&s;tly practices too plainly denoted a total want of all police and civil regulation, and would have reflected di&s;grace upon the mo&s;t barbarous community. In order to re&s;train this evil, which was become intolerable, the legi&s;lature enacted that law which we have already men|tioned. But the populace &s;oon broke through all re&s;traint. Though no licence was obtained, and no duty payed, the liquor continued to be &s;old in all corners of the &s;treets: informers were intimidated by the threats of the people; and the ju&s;tices of the peace, either from indolence or corruption, neglected to put the law in execution. The new mini&s;ters fore&s;aw that a great revenue would accrue to the crown from a repeal of this act; and this mea&s;ure they thought they might the more decently take, as the law had proved ineffectual: for, it appeared, that the con&s;umption of gin had con&s;iderably increa&s;ed every year &s;ince tho&s;e heavy duties were impo&s;ed. They therefore pretended, that &s;hould the price of the liquor be moderately rai&s;ed, and licences granted at twenty &s;hillings each to the retailers, the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of people would be debarred the u&s;e of it to exce&s;s; their morals would of con&s;equence be mended, and a con&s;iderable &s;um of money might be rai&s;ed for the &s;upport of the war, by mortgaging the revenue ari&s;ing from the duty and the licences. Upon the&s;e maxims the new bill was founded, and pa&s;&s;ed through the lower hou&s;e without oppo&s;ition; but, among the peers it produced the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate di&s;pute which had happened &s;ince the beginning of this parliament. The fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault it &s;u&s;tained was from lord Hervey, who had been dive&s;ted of his po&s;t of privy-&s;eal, which was be&s;towed on lord Gower; and the&s;e two noblemen exchanged principles from that in&s;tant. The fir&s;t was hardened into a &s;turdy patriot, the other &s;uppled into an ob&s;equious courtier. Lord Hervey, on this occa&s;ion, made a florid harangue, upon the pernicious effects of that de&s;tructive &s;pirit they were about to let loo&s;e upon their fellow-creatures. Several prelates expatiated on the &s;ame topics; but, the earl of Che&s;terfield attacked the bill with the united powers of rea&s;on, wit, and ridicule. The lord Carteret, the lord Bathur&s;t, and the earl of Bath, were numbered among its advocates; and &s;hrewd arguments were advanced on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. After very long, warm, and repeated debates, the bill pa&s;&s;ed without amendments, though the whole bench of bi&s;hops voted again&s;t it; and we can|not help owning, that it has not been attended with tho&s;e di&s;mal con&s;equences which the lords in the oppo&s;ition foretold. When the que&s;tion was put for committing this bill, and the earl of Che&s;terfield &s;aw the bi&s;hops join in his divi&s;ion, <Q>&startq;I am in doubt, &s;aid he, whether I have not got on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion; for I have not had the honour to divide with &s;o many lawn|&s;leeves for &s;everal years.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>By the report of the &s;ecret committee it appeared, that the then mini&s;ter had commenced pro&s;ecutions again&s;t the mayors of boroughs who oppo&s;ed his influence in the elections of members of parliament. The&s;e pro&s;e|cutions were founded on ambiguities in charters, or trivial informalities in the choice of magi&s;trates. An appeal on &s;uch a proce&s;s was brought into the hou&s;e of lords; and this evil falling under con&s;ideration, a bill was prepared for &s;ecuring the independency of corporations: but, as it tended to dimini&s;h the influence of the mini&s;try, they argued again&s;t it with their u&s;ual eagerne&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s; and it was rejected on a divi&s;ion. The mutiny-bill and &s;everal others pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es. The commons granted &s;upplies to the amount of &s;ix mil|lions, rai&s;ed by the land-tax, the malt-tax, duties on &s;pirituous liquors, and licences, and a loan from the &s;inking-fund. In two years the national debt had &s;uffered an increa&s;e of two millions four hundred thou&s;and pounds. On the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1743</NOTE> twenty-fir&s;t day of April the &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed in the u&s;ual manner. The king in his &s;peech to both hou&s;es told them, that at the requi&s;ition of the queen of Hungary, he had ordered his army, in conjunction with the Au&s;trians, to pa&s;s the Rhine for her &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance: that he had continued one &s;qua|dron of &s;hips in the Mediterranean, and another in the We&s;t-Indies. He thanked the commons for the ample &s;upplies they had granted; and, declared, it was the fixed purpo&s;e of his heart, to promote the true inter&s;t and happi|ne&s;s of his kingdoms. Immediately after the prorogation of parliament he embarked for Germany, accompanied by the duke of Cumberland, the lord Carteret, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction.</P>

<P>At this period the queen of Hungary &s;eemed to triumph over all her enemies. The French were driven out of Bohemia and part of the Upper Palatinate; and their forces under marechal Broglio were po&s;ted on the Danube. Prince Charles of Lorraine, at the head of the Au&s;trian army, entered Bavaria; and in April obtained a victory over a body of Bavarians at Braunau: at the &s;ame time three bodies of Croatians penetrating through the pa&s;&s;es of the Tyroleze, ravaged the open country to the very gates of Munich. The emperor pre&s;&s;ed the French general to hazard a battle; but, he refu&s;ed to run this ri&s;que, though he had received a &s;trong reinforcement from France. His Imperial maje&s;ty thinking him&s;elf un&s;afe in Munich, retired to Aug&s;burgh, and marechal Seckendorf retreated with the Bavarian troops to Ingold&s;tadt, where he was afterwards joined by marechal Broglio, who&s;e troops had in this retreat been pur&s;ued and terribly harra&s;&s;ed by the Au&s;trian cavalry and hu&s;&s;ars. Prince Charles had now a free communication with Munich, which now for the third time fell into the hands of the queen of Hungary. Her arms likewi&s;e reduced Friedberg and Land&s;perg; while prince Charles continued to pur&s;ue the French to Dona|wert, where they were joined by twelve thou&s;and men from the Rhine. Broglio &s;till avoided an engagement, and retreated before the enemy to Hailbron. The emperor being thus abandoned by his allies, and &s;tripped of all his dominions, repaired to Franckfort, where he lived in indigence and ob&s;curity. He now made advances towards an accommodation with the queen of Hungary. His general Seckendorf had an interview with count Khevenhuller at the convent of Lower&s;confield, where a convention was &s;igned, importing, That the emperor &s;hould remain neuter during the continuance of the pre&s;ent war; and, That his troops &s;hould be quartered in Franconia: That the queen of Hungary &s;hould keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bavaria till the peace: That Braunau and Scharding
<PB N="634" REF="6370">
&s;hould be delivered up to the Au&s;trians: That the French garri&s;on of Ingold&s;tadt &s;hould be permitted to withdraw, and be replaced by Bavarians; but, that the Au|&s;trian generals &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the artillery, magazines, and war|like &s;tores belonging to the French, which &s;hould be found in the place.

In Ingold&s;tadt they found all the emperor's dome&s;tic trea&s;ure, jewels, plate, pictures, cabinets, and curio&s;ities, with the archives of the hou&s;e of Bavaria, the mo&s;t valuable effects belonging to the nobility of that electorate, a prodigious train of artillery, and a va&s;t quantity of provi&s;ions, arms, and ammunition.</P>

<P>The French king, ba&s;&s;led in all the efforts he had hitherto made for the &s;upport of the emperor, ordered his mini&s;ter at Franckfort to deliver a declaration to the diet, profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf extremely well plea&s;ed to hear they intended to interpo&s;e their mediation for terminating the war. He &s;aid, he was no le&s;s &s;atisfied with the treaty of neutrality which the emperor had concluded with the queen of Hungary; an event of which he was no &s;ooner informed, than he had ordered his troops to return to the frontiers of his dominions, that the Germanic body might be convinced of his equity and moderation. To this declaration the queen of Hungary an&s;wered in a re&s;cript, that the de&s;ign of France was to embarra&s;s her affairs, and deprive her of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her allies: that the elector of Bavaria could not be con&s;idered as a neutral party in his own cau&s;e: that the mediation of the empire could only produce a peace either with or without the concurrence of France: that in the former ca&s;e no &s;olid peace could be expected; in the latter, it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that France would pay no regard to a peace in which &s;he &s;hould have no concern. She affirm|ed, that the aim of the French king was &s;olely to gain time to repair his lo&s;&s;es, that he might afterwards revive the troubles of the empire. The elector of Mentz, who had favoured the emperor, was now dead, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or inclined to the Au&s;trian intere&s;t. He allowed this re&s;cript to be entered in the journal of the diet, together with the prote&s;ts which had been made when the vote of Bohemia was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in the late election. The emperor complained in a circular letter of this tran&s;action as a &s;troke levelled at his Imperial dignity; and it gave ri&s;e to a warm di&s;pute among the members of the Germanic body. Several princes re&s;ented the haughty conduct, and began to be alarmed at the &s;ucce&s;s of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and others pitied the deplorable &s;ituation of the emperor. The kings of Great-Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia, as electors of Hanover and Brandenburgh, e&s;pou&s;ed oppo&s;ite &s;ides in this conte&s;t. His Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty prote&s;ted again&s;t the inve&s;titure of the dutchy of Saxe-Lawenburgh, claimed by the king of Great-Britain: he had an interview with general Seckendorf at An&s;pach, and was &s;aid to have privately vi&s;ited the emperor at Franckfort.</P>

<P>The troops which the king of Great Britain had a&s;&s;embled in the Netherlands, began their march for the Rhine in the latter end of February; and in May they incamped near Hoech on the river Mayne, under the command of the earl of Stair, who &s;ent major-general Bland to Franckfort with a compliment to the emperor, a&s;&s;uring him, in the name of his Britannic maje&s;ty, that the re&s;pect owing to his dignity &s;hould not be violated, nor the place of his re&s;idence di&s;turbed. Notwith&s;tanding this a&s;&s;urance the emperor retired to Munich, though he was afterwards compelled to return by the &s;ucce&s;s of the
<PB N="635" REF="6380">
Au&s;trians in Bavaria. The French king, in order to prevent the junction of the Briti&s;h forces with prince Charles of Lorraine, ordered the marechal de Noailles to a&s;&s;emble &s;ixty thou&s;and men upon the Mayne; while Coigny was &s;ent into Al&s;ace with a numerous army, to defend that province and oppo&s;e prince Charles, &s;hould he attempt to pa&s;s the Rhine. The marechal de Noailles having &s;ecured the towns of Spire, Worms, and Oppenheim, pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in the beginning of June, and po&s;ted him&s;elf on the ea&s;t &s;ide of that river, above Franckfort. The earl of Stair advanced towards him, and encamped at Kil|lenbach, between the river Mayne and the fore&s;t of D'Arm&s;tadt; from this &s;ituation he made a motion to A&s;chaffenburgh, with a view to &s;ecure the navi|gation of the Upper Mayne; but, he was anticipated by the enemy, who lay on the other &s;ide of the river, and had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the po&s;ts above, &s;o as to intercept all &s;upplies. They were po&s;ted on the other &s;ide of the river, oppo&s;ite to the allies, who&s;e camp they overlooked; and they found means, by their parties and other precautions, to cut off the communication by water between Franckfort and the confederates. The duke of Cumberland had already come to make his fir&s;t campaign, and his maje&s;ty arrived in the camp on the ninth day of June. He found his army, amounting to about forty thou&s;and men, in danger of &s;tarving: he received intelligence, that a reinforcement of twelve thou&s;and Hanoverians and He&s;&s;ians had reached Hanau; and he re&s;olved to march thither, both with a view to effect the junction, and to procure provi&s;ion for his forces. With this view he decamped on the twenty-&s;ixth day of June. He had no &s;ooner quitted A&s;chaffenburgh than it was &s;eized by the French; and he had not marched above three leagues, when he perceived the enemy, to the number of thirty thou&s;and, had pa&s;&s;ed the river farther down, and were drawn up in order of battle at the village of Dettingen, to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age. Thus he found him&s;elf cooped up in a very dangerous &s;ituation. The enemy had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of A&s;chaffenburgh behind, &s;o as to prevent his retreat: his troops were confined in a narrow plain, bounded by hills and woods on the right, flanked on the left by the river Mayne, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of which the French had erected batteries that annoyed the allies on their march; and in the front a con&s;iderable part of the French army was drawn up, with a narrow pa&s;s before them, the village of Dettingen on their right, a wood on the left, and a mora&s;s in the center. Thus environed, the confederates mu&s;t either have fought at a very great di&s;advantage, or &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, had not the duke de Gramont, who commanded the enemy, been in&s;tigated by the &s;pirit of madne&s;s to foregoe the&s;e advantages. He pa&s;&s;ed the defile, and advancing towards the allies, a battle en&s;ued. The French hor&s;e charged with great impetuo&s;ity, and &s;ome regiments of Briti&s;h cavalry were put in di&s;order; but, the infantry of the allies behaved with &s;uch intrepidity and deliberation, under the eye of their &s;overeign, as &s;oon determined the fate of the day: the French were obliged to give way, and repa&s;s the Mayne with great precipita|tion, having lo&s;t about five thou&s;and men killed, wounded, or taken. Had they been properly pur&s;ued before they recollected them&s;elves from their fir&s;t confu&s;ion, in all probability they would have &s;u&s;tained a total overthrow. The earl of Stair propo&s;ed, that a body of cavalry &s;hould be detached on this &s;ervice; but, his advice was over-ruled. The lo&s;s of the allies in this action amounted to two thou&s;and men. The generals Clayton and Monroy were killed: the
<PB N="636" REF="6390">
duke of Cumberland, who exhibited uncommon proofs of courage, was &s;hot through the calf of the leg: the earl of Albemarle, general Hu&s;ke, and &s;everal $word$ offers of di&s;t nction, were wounded. The king expo&s;ed his per&s;on to a $word$ fire of cannon as well as mu&s;quetry: he rode between the fir&s;t and &s;econd lines with his $$ord drawn, and encouraged the troops to fight for the honour of England. Immediately after the action he continued his march to Hanau, where he was joined by the reinforcement. The earl of Stair &s;ent a trumpet to $word$ de Neailles, recommending to his protection the &s;ick and wounded that were left on the field of battle; and the&s;e the French general treated with great care and tenderne&s;s. Such genero&s;ity &s;oftens the rigours of war, and does honour to humanity.</P>

<P>The two armies continued on different &s;ides of the river till the twelfth day of July, when the French general receiving intelligence, that prince Charles of Lorraine had approached the Neckar, he &s;uddenly retired, and repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine between Worms and Oppenheim. The king of Great-Britain was vi&s;ited by prince Charles and count Khevenhuller at Hanau, where the future operations of the campaign were regulated. On the twenty-&s;eventh day of Augu&s;t, the allied army pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Mentz, and the king fixed his head-quarters in the epi&s;copal palace at Worms. Here the forces lay encamped till the latter end of September, when they advanced to Spire, where they were joined by twenty thou&s;and Dutch auxiliaries from the Netherlands. Marechal Noallies having retreated into Upper Al&s;ace, the allies took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Germer&s;heim, and demoli&s;hed the intrenchments which the enemy had rai&s;ed on the Quei$h; than they returned to Mentz, and in October were di&s;tributed into winter-quarters, after an inactive campaign that redounded very little to the honour of tho&s;e by whom the motions of the army were conducted. In September a treaty had been concluded at Worms between his Britannic maje&s;ty, the king of Sardinia, and the queen of Hungary. She engaged to maintain thirty thou&s;and men in Italy: the king of Sardinia obliged him&s;elf to employ forty thou&s;and infantry and five thou&s;and hor&s;e, in con&s;ideration of his commanding the combined army, and receiving an annual &s;ub&s;idy of two hundred thou&s;and pounds from Great-Britain. As a further gratification, the queen yielded to him the city of Placentia, with &s;everal di&s;tricts in the dutchy of Pavia, and in the Novare&s;e; and all her right and preten&s;ions to Final, at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the republic of Genoa, which, they hoped, would give it up on being repayed the purcha&s;e-money, which amounted to three hundred thou|&s;and pounds. This &s;um the king of England promi&s;ed to di&s;bur&s;e; and moreover to maintain a &s;trong &s;quadron in the Mediterranean, the commander of which &s;hould act in concert with his Sardinian maje&s;ty. Finally, the contracting powers agreed, That Final &s;hould be con&s;tituted a free-port like that of Leghorn. Nothing could be more unju&s;t than this treaty, by which the Genoe&s;e were negotiated but of their property. They had purcha&s;ed the marqui&s;ate of Final of the late emperor for a valuable con&s;ideration, and the purcha&s;e had been guaranteed by Great-Britain. It could not therefore be expected, that they would part with this acqui&s;ition to a prince who&s;e power they thought already too formidable; e&s;pecially, on condition of its being made a free-port, to the prejudice of their own commerce. They pre&s;ented remon&s;trances again&s;t this article, by their mini&s;ters at the courts of London, Vienna, and Turin; and as
<PB N="637" REF="6400">
very little regard was payed to their repre&s;entations, they threw them&s;elves into the arms of France and Spain for protection.</P>

<P>After the battle of Dettingen colonel Mentzel, at the head of a large body of irregulars belonging to the queen of Hungary, made an irruption into Lorraine, part of which they ravaged without mercy. In September prince Charles, with the Au&s;trian army, entered the Bri&s;gaw, and attempted to pa&s;s the Rhine; but, marachal Colgny had taken &s;uch precautions for guarding it on the other &s;ide, that he was obliged to abandon his de&s;ign, and marching back into the Upper Palatinate, quartered his troops in that country and in Bavaria. By this time the earl of Stair had &s;ollicited and obtained leave to re&s;ign his com|mand. He had for &s;ome time thought him&s;elf neglected; and was unwilling that his reputation &s;hould &s;uffer on account of mea&s;ures in which he had no concern. In October the king of Great-Britain returned to Hanover, and the army &s;eparated. The troops in Briti&s;h pay marched back to the Netherlands, and the re&s;t took the route to their re&s;pective countries. The &s;tates-general &s;till wavered between their own immediate intere&s;t and their de&s;ire to &s;upport the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. At length, however, they &s;upplied her with a &s;ub&s;idy, and ordered twenty thou&s;and men to march to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, notwith&s;tanding the intrigues of the marquis de Fenelon, the French amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, and the declaration of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who di&s;approved of this mea&s;ure, and refu&s;ed them a pa&s;&s;age through his territories, to the Rhine.</P>

<P>Sweden was filled with di&s;contents, and divided into factions. The generals Bodenbrock and Lewenhaupt were beheaded, having been &s;acrificed as &s;cape goats for the mini&s;try. Some un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts by &s;ea and land were made again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians. At la&s;t the peace of Abo was concluded; and the duke of Hol&s;tein Utin, uncle to the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the Ru&s;&s;ian throne, was cho&s;en as next heir to the crown of Sweden. A party had been formed in favour of the prince of Denmark; and the order of the pea&s;ants actually elected him as &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The debates in the college of nobles ro&s;e to a very dangerous degree of animo&s;ity, and were appea&s;ed by an harangue in Swedi&s;h ver&s;e, which one of the &s;enators pronounced. The pea&s;ants yielded the point, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was &s;ettled on the duke of Hol&s;tein. Denmark, in&s;tigated by French coun&s;els, began to make preparations of war again&s;t Sweden; but, a body of Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries arriving in that kingdom, under the command of general Keith, and the czarina declaring &s;he would a&s;&s;i&s;t the Swedes with her whole force, the king of Denmark thought proper to di&s;arm. It had been an old maxim of French policy to embroil the courts of the North, that they might be too much employed at home to intermeddle in the affairs of Germany, while France was at war with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The good under&s;tanding between the czarina and the queen of Hungary, was at this period de&s;troyed, in con&s;equence of a con&s;piracy which had been formed by &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction at the court of Petersburgh, for removing the empre&s;s Elizabeth, and recalling the prince&s;s Anne to the admini&s;tration. This de&s;ign being di&s;covered, the principal con&s;pirators were corporally puni&s;hed, and &s;ent in exile to Siberia. The marquis de Botta, the Au&s;trian mini&s;ter, who had re&s;ided at the court of the czarina, was &s;u&s;pected of having been concerned in the plot; though the grounds of this &s;u&s;picion did not appear until after he was recalled and &s;ent as amba&s;&s;ador to the court of Berlin. The empre&s;s demanded &s;atisfaction of the
<PB N="638" REF="6410">
queen of Hungary, who appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to inquire into his conduct, and he was acquitted; but the czarina was not at all &s;atisfied of his innocence. In February a defen&s;ive treaty of alliance was concluded between this prince&s;s and the king of Great-Britain.</P>

<P>By this time France was deprived of her able&s;t mini&s;ter in the death of the cardinal de Fleury, who had for many years managed the affairs of that kingdom. He is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a lively genius, and an in&s;inuat|ing addre&s;s; to have been regular in his deportment, and moderate in his di&s;po&s;ition; but at the &s;ame time he has been branded as deceitful, di&s;&s;embling, and vindictive. His &s;cheme of politics was altogether pacific: he endea|voured to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;es by rai&s;ing and fomenting intrigues at foreign courts: he did not &s;eem to pay much regard to the military glory of France$ and he too much neglected the naval power of that kingdom. Since Broglio was driven out of Germany, the French court affected uncommon moderation. They pretended, that their troops had only acted as auxiliaries while they remained in the empire; but, being apprehen&s;ive of an irruption into their own dominions, they declared, that tho&s;e troops were no longer to be con&s;idered in that light, but as &s;ubjects acting in the &s;ervice of France. The campaign in Italy proved unfavourable to the Spaniards. In the beginning of February count Gages, who commanded the Spani&s;h army in the Bologne&s;e, amounting to four and twenty thou&s;and men, pa&s;&s;ed the Panaro in the beginning of February, and advanced to Campo-Santo, where he encountered the Imperial and Piedmonte&s;e forces, commanded by count Traun and count A&s;premont. The &s;trength of the two armies was nearly equal. The action was ob&s;tinate and bloody, though indeci&s;ive. The Spaniards lo&s;t about four thou&s;and men, killed, wounded, or taken. The damage &s;u&s;tained by the confederates was not quite &s;o great. Some cannon and colours were taken on both &s;ides; and each claimed the victory. Count Gages repa&s;&s;ed the Panaro; retreated &s;uddenly from Bologna, and marched to Rimini in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, where he fortified his camp in an advantageous &s;ituation, after having &s;uffered &s;everely by de&s;ertion. Count Traun remained inactive in the Modene&s;e till September, when he re&s;igned his command to prince Lobkowitz. This general entered the Bologne&s;e in October, and then advanced towards count Gages, who, with his forces, now reduced to &s;even thou&s;and, retreated to Fano; but afterwards took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Pe&s;aro, and fortified all the pa&s;&s;es of the river Foglia. The &s;ea|&s;on was far advanced before the Spani&s;h troops, commanded by Don Philip, in Savoy, entered upon action. In all probability, the courts of Ver&s;ailles and Madrid carried on &s;ome private negotiation with the king of Sardinia. This expedient failing, Don Philip decamped from Chamberri in the latter end of Augu&s;t, and defiling through Dauphin&eacute; towards Brian&ccedil;on, was joined by the prince of Conti, at the head of twenty thou&s;and French auxiliaries. Thus reinforced, he attacked the Piedmonte&s;e lines at Chateau Dauphin&eacute;; but was repul&s;ed in &s;everal attempts, and obliged to retreat with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. The French e&s;tabli&s;hed their winter-quarters in Dauphin&eacute; and Provence; and the Spaniards maintained their footing in Savoy.</P>

<P>The Briti&s;h fleet commanded by admiral Matthews overawed all the &s;tates that bordered on the Mediterranean. About the end of June under|&s;tanding, that fourteen xebecks, loaded with artillery and ammunition for the
<PB N="639" REF="6420">
Spani&s;h army, had arrived at Genoa, he &s;ailed thither from the road of Hieres, and demanded of the republic, that they would either oblige the&s;e ve&s;&s;els with the &s;tores to quit their harbour, or &s;eque&s;ter their lading until a general peace &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed. After &s;ome di&s;pute it was agreed, that the cannon and &s;tores &s;hould be depo&s;ited in the ca&s;tle of Bonifacio, &s;ituated on a rock at the &s;outh end of Cor&s;ica: and, that the xebecks &s;hould have leave to retire without mole&s;tation. The Cor&s;icans had &s;ome years before revolted, and &s;haken off the dominion of the Genoe&s;e, under which their i&s;land had remained for many centuries. They found them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed, and re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ert their free|dom. They conferred the &s;overeign authority on a German adventurer, who was &s;olemnly proclaimed by the name of king Theodore. He had &s;upplied them with &s;ome arms and ammunition which he had brought from Tunis; and amu&s;ed them with promi&s;es of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by foreign powers in retrieving their independency; but as the&s;e promi&s;es were not performed, they treated him &s;o roughly, that he had thought proper to quit the i&s;land, and they &s;ubmitted again to their old ma&s;ters. The troubles of Cor&s;ica were now revived. Theodore revi&s;ited his kingdom, and was recognized by the principal chiefs of the i&s;land He publi&s;hed a manife&s;to: he granted a general pardon to all his &s;ubjects who &s;hould return to their obedience; and prerended to be countenanced and &s;up|ported by the king of Great-Britain and the queen of Hungary. He was certainly thought a proper in&s;trument to perplex and harra&s;s the Genoe&s;e, and &s;upplied at this juncture with a &s;um of money, to purcha&s;e arms for the Cor&s;icans; but, a change &s;oon happened in the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, and then he was &s;uffered to relap&s;e into his original ob&s;curity. Admiral Matthews, though he did not undertake any expedition of importance again&s;t the maritime towns of Spain, continued to a&s;&s;ert the Briti&s;h empire at &s;ea through the whole extent of the Mediterranean. The Spani&s;h army under Don Philip was no &s;ooner in motion, than the Engli&s;h admiral ordered &s;ome troops and cannon to be di&s;embarked for the &s;ecurity of Villa-Franca. Some &s;tores having been landed at Civita-Vecchia for the u&s;e of the Spani&s;h forces under count Gages, Matthews interpreted this tran&s;action into a violation of the neutrality which the pope had profe&s;&s;ed; and &s;ent thither a &s;quadron to bombard the place. The city of Rome was filled with con&s;ternation; and the pope had recour&s;e to the good offices of his Sar|dinian maje&s;ty, in con&s;equence of which the Engli&s;h &s;quadron was ordered to withdraw. The captains of &s;ingle crui&s;ing &s;hips, by their activity and vigilance, wholly interrupted the commerce of Spain, cannonaded and burned &s;ome towns on the &s;ea-&s;ide, and kept the whole coa&s;t in continual alarm <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In May a dreadful plague broke out at Me&s;&s;ina in Sicily. It was imported in cotton and other commodities brought from the Morea; and &s;wept off &s;uch a multitude of people, that the city was almo&s;t depopulated: all the galley-&s;laves who were employed in burying the dead, peri&s;hed by the contagion; and this was the fate of many prie&s;ts and monks who admini&s;tered to tho&s;e who were infected. The dead bodies lay in heaps on the &s;treets, corrupting the air, and adding fre&s;h fuel to the rage of the pe&s;tilence. Numbers died mi&s;erably for want of proper attendance and ne|ce&s;&s;aries; and all was horror and de&s;olation. At the beginning of winter it cea&s;ed, after having de&s;troyed near fifty thou&s;and inhabitants of Me&s;|&s;ina, and of the garri&s;ons in the citadel and ca&s;tle. It was prevented from &s;preading in Sicily by a &s;trong barricado drawn from Melazzo to Taor|mina; but, it was conveyed to Reggio in Cala|bria, by the avarice of a broker of that place, who bought &s;ome goods at Me&s;&s;ina. The king of Naples immediately ordered lines to be formed, together with a chain of troops, which cut off all commu|nication between that place and the re&s;t of the continent.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>In the We&s;t-Indies &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts were made by an Engli&s;h &s;quadron, commanded by commodore Knowles. He attacked La Gueira on the coa&s;t of Carraccas, in the month of February; but, met with &s;uch a warm reception, that he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t, and make the be&s;t of his way for the Dutch i&s;land Curacoa, where he repaired the damage he had &s;u&s;|tained. His &s;hips being refitted, he made another attempt upon Porto-Cavallo in April, which like the former mi&s;carried. Twelve hundred marines being landed in the neighbourhood of the place, were &s;eized with &s;uch a pannic, that it was found nece&s;&s;ary to reimbark them without delay. Then the commodore abandoned the enterprize, and &s;ailed back to his &s;tation at the Leeward-I&s;lands, without having added much to his reputation either as to conduct or re&s;olution. On the continent of America the operations of the war were very incon&s;idera|ble. General Oglethorpe having received intelligence, that the Spaniards prepared for another inva&s;ion from St. Augu&s;tine, a&s;&s;embled a body of Indians as a reinforcement to part of his own regiment, with the Highlanders and rangers; and in the &s;pring began his march, in order to anticipate the enemy. He encamped for &s;ome time in the neighbourhood of St. Augu&s;tine, by way of defiance: but they did not think proper to hazard an engagement; and as he was in no condition to undertake a &s;iege, he returned to Georgia. In October the prince&s;s Loui&s;a, younge&s;t daughter of his Britannic maje&s;ty, was married by proxy at Hanover, to the prince-royal of Denmark, who met her at Altena, and conducted her to Copenhagen.</P>

<P>THE di&s;contents of England were artfully inflamed by antimini&s;terial writers, who not only exaggerated the burthens of the people, and drew frightful pictures of the di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery, which they &s;aid, impended over the nation, but al&s;o employed the arts of calumny and mi&s;repre&s;entation, to excite a jealou&s;y and national quarrel between the Engli&s;h and Hanoverians. They affirmed, that in the la&s;t campaign the Briti&s;h general had been neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed; while the coun&s;els of foreign officers, $word$ inferior to him in capacity, quality, and reputation, had been followed, to the prejudice of the common cau&s;e: that the Briti&s;h troops &s;u&s;tained daily in&s;ults from their own mercenaries, who were indulged with particular marks of royal &s;avour: that the &s;over$ign him&s;elf appeared at D$tting$n in a Hanoverian &s;earr$: and, that his electoral troops were of very little &s;ervice in that engagement.

on the minds of the people, already irritated by the enormous expence of a contin$ntal war maintained for the intere&s;t of Germany. When the parlia|ment in the beginning of December, a motion was made in the hou&s;e of $word$ by the earl of Sandwi$h, for an address, be&s;e$ching his maje&s;ty to di&s;continue the $word$ troops in Briti&s;h pay, in order to remove the popular di&s;content, and $word$ the murmurs of the Engli&s;h troops abroad.

The&s;e were the &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;pleen and ani|mo&s;ity: for, granting the nece&s;&s;ity of a land-war, the Hanoverians were the mo&s;t natural $word$ and auxiliaries which Great-Britain could engage and employ. How in$olent &s;oever &s;ome &s;ew individual generals of that electorate might have been in thei$ private deportment, certain it is, their troops behaved with great &s;obri$ty, $word$ a$d decorum; and in the day of battle did their duty with as mu$h courage and $lacrity as any body of men ever di&s;played on the like o$$a&s;ion.

<P>In the hou&s;e of commons they &s;u&s;tained divers attacks. A motion was ma$e for laying a duty of eight &s;hillings in the pound on all places and pen|&s;i$ns. Mr. Greenville moved for an addre&s;s, to be&s;eech his maje&s;ty, that he would not engage the Briti$h nat$on any further in the war on the continent, without the concurrence of the &s;tates-general, on certain &s;tipulated proportions of force and exp$$ce, as in the late war. The&s;e propo&s;als begat vigorous debates, in which the c$untry-party were always foiled by dint of &s;uperior number. Such was t$e credit and influence of the mini&s;try in parliament, that although the na|tional debt was increa&s;ed by above &s;ix millions &s;ince the commencement of the war, the commons indulged them with an enormous &s;um for the expence of the en&s;$ing year. The grants &s;pecified in the votes amounted to &s;ix millions and an hair$ to this &s;um were added three millions and an half payed to the &s;inking fund in perpetual taxes; &s;o that this year's expence ro&s;e to ten millions.

<P>The di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the Briti&s;h parliament were &s;uddenly &s;u&s;pended by an event that &s;eemed to unite both parties in the pro&s;ecution of the &s;ame mea&s;ures. This was the intelligence of an intended inva&s;ion. By the parliamentary di&s;putes, the loud clamours, and the general di&s;&s;atisfaction of the people in Great-Britain, the French mini&s;try were per&s;uaded, that the nation was ripe for revolt. This belief was corroborated by the a&s;&s;ertions of their emi&s;&s;aries in dif|ferent parts of Great-Britain and Ireland. The&s;e were papi&s;ts and jacobites of &s;trong prejudices and warm imaginations, who &s;aw things through the medium of pa&s;&s;ion and party, and &s;poke rather from extravagant zeal than from &s;ober conviction. They gave the court of Ver&s;ailles to under&s;tand, that if the chevalier de St. George, or his elde&s;t &s;on Charles-Edward, &s;hould appear at the head of a French army in Great-Britain, a revolution would in&s;tantly follow in his favour. This intimation was agreeable to cardinal de Tencin, who had &s;ucceeded Fleury as prime-mini&s;ter of France He was of a violent enterpri&s;ing temper. He had been recommended to the purple by the chevalier de St. George, and was warmly attached to the Stuart family. His ambition was &s;lattered with a pro&s;pect of giving a king to Great-Britain, of performing &s;uch eminent &s;ervice to his benefactor, and of re&s;toring to the throne of their ance&s;tors, a family connected by the ties of blood with all the greate&s;t princes of Europe. He fore&s;aw, that even if his aim &s;hould mi&s;carry, a de&s;cent upon Great-Britain wo$ld make a con&s;iderable diver&s;ion from the continent in favour of France, and embroil and embarra&s;s his Britannic maje&s;ty, who was the chief &s;upport of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and all its allies. Actuated by the&s;e motives, he concerted mea&s;ures with the chevalier de St. Geo$ge at Rome, who being too much advanced in years to engage per&s;onally in &s;uch an expedition, agreed to delegate his preten|&s;ions and authority to his &s;on Charles, a youth of promi&s;ing talents, &s;age, &s;ecret, brave, and enterpri&s;ing; amiable in his per&s;on, grave, and even re&s;erved in his deportment. He approved him&s;elf in the &s;equel compo&s;ed and moderate in &s;ucce&s;s, wonderfully firm in adver&s;ity; and, though tenderly nur&s;ed in all the delights of an effeminate country, and gentle climate, patient almo&s;t beyond belief of cold, hunger, and fatigue. Such was the adventurer now de&s;$ined to fulfil the hope which the French mini&s;ter had conceived from the projected inva&s;ion of Great-Britain.</P>

<P>Count Saxe was appointed by the French king commander of the troops de&s;igned for this expedition, whi$h amounted to fift$en thou|&s;and.

It was determined that they &s;hould be landed in Kent, under conv$y of a &s;trong &s;quadron equipped at Bre&s;t, and commanded by mon&s;ieur de Roqu$$$uille, an officer of experience and capacity.

<P>Mean while the French court proceeded with their preparations, at Boulogne and Dunkirk, under the eye of the young pretender; and &s;even thou|&s;and men were actually embarked. M. de Roquefeuille &s;ailed up the channel as far as Dungene&s;s, a promontory on the coa&s;t of Kent, after having de|tached M. de Barreil with five &s;hips, to ha&s;ten the embarkation at Dunkirk. While the French admiral anchored off Dungene&s;s, he perceived, on the twenty-fourth day of February, the Briti&s;h fleet under Sir John Norris, doubling the South-Foreland from the Downs; and, though the wind was again&s;t him, taking the opportunity of the tide to come up and engage the French &s;qua|dron. Roquefeuille, who little expected &s;uch a vi&s;it, could not be altogether compo&s;ed, con&s;idering the great &s;uperiority of his enemies: but the tide failing, the Engli&s;h admiral was obliged to anchor two leagues &s;hort of the enemy. In this interval, M. Roquefeuille called a council of war, in which it was determined to avoid an engagement, weigh anchor at &s;un&s;et, and make the be&s;t of their way to the place from whence they had &s;et &s;ail. This re&s;olution was favoured by a very hard gale of wind, which began to blow from the north-ea&s;t, and carried them down the channel with incredible expedition. But the &s;ame &s;torm which, in all probability, &s;aved their fleet from de&s;truction, utterly di&s;|concerted the de&s;ign of invading England. A great number of their tran&s;ports was driven a&s;hore and de&s;troyed, and the re&s;t &s;o damaged that they could not be &s;peedily repaired. The Engli&s;h were now ma&s;ters at &s;ea, and their coa&s;t was &s;o well guarded that the enterprize could not be pro&s;ecuted with any probabi|lity of &s;ucce&s;s. The French generals nominated to &s;erve in this expedition re|turned to Paris, and the pretender re&s;olved to wait a more favourable oppor|tunity. The French king no longer pre&s;erved any mea&s;ures with the court of London: the Briti&s;h re&s;ident at Paris was given to under&s;tand, that a decla|ration of war mu&s;t en&s;ue; and this was actually publi&s;hed on the twentieth day of March. The king of Great-Britain was taxed with having di&s;&s;uaded the court of Vienna from entertaining any thoughts of an accommodation; with having infringed the convention of Hanover; with having exerci&s;ed piracy upon the &s;ubjects of France, and even blocked up the harbour of Toulon. On the thirty-fir&s;t day of March, a like denunciation of war again&s;t France was publi&s;hed at London, amid&s;t the acclamations of the people.</P>

In the upper hou&s;e, lord Hardwicke the chancellor moved, that a clau&s;e &s;hould be in&s;erted, ex|tending the crime of trea&s;on to the po&s;terity of the offenders, during the lives of the pretender's &s;ons. The motion, which was &s;upported by the whole &s;trength of the mini&s;try, produced a warm debate, in which the duke of Bed|ford, the earl of Che&s;terfield, the lords Talbot and Harvey, argued again&s;t it in the mo&s;t pathetic manner, as an illiberal expedient, contrary to the dictates

<P>By this time an action had happened in the Mediterranean between the Briti&s;h f$eet commanded by admiral Matthews, and the combined &s;quadrons of France and Spain, which had been for &s;ome time blocked up in the harbour of Toulon. On the ninth day of February they were perceived &s;tanding out of the road, to the number of four and thirty &s;ail: the Engli&s;h admiral imme|diately weighed from Hieres-bay; and on the eleventh, part of the fleets engaged. Matthews attacked the Spani&s;h admiral Don Navarro, who&s;e &s;hip the Real was a fir&s;t-rate, mounted with above an hundred guns. The rear|admiral Rowley &s;ingled out M. de Court who commanded the French &s;quadron; and a very few captains followed the example of their commanders: but vice admiral Le&s;tock, with his whole divi&s;ion, remained at a great di&s;tance a$tern; and &s;everal captains that were immediately under the eye of Matthews, behaved in &s;uch a manner as reflected di&s;grace upon their country. The whole tran&s;action was conducted without order or deliberation. The French and Spaniards would have willingly avoided an engagement, as the Briti&s;h &s;quadron was &s;uperior to them in &s;trength and number. M. de Court therefore made the be$t of his way towards the Streights mouth, probably with intention to join the Bre&s;t &s;quadron: but, he had orders to protect the Spani&s;h fleet; and as they &s;ailed heavily, he was obliged to wait for them, at the hazard of maintain|ing a battle with the Engli&s;h. Thus circum&s;tanced he made &s;ail and lay to by turns; &s;o that the Briti&s;h admiral could not engage them in proper order; and as they out&s;ailed his &s;hips, he began to fear they w#uld e&s;cape him altogether &s;hould he wait for vice-admiral Le&s;tock, who was &s;o far a&s;tern. Under this apprehen&s;ion he made the &s;ignal for engaging, while that for the line of battle was &s;till di&s;|played; and this incon&s;$$tency naturally introduced confu&s;ion. The fight was maintained by the few who engaged with great vivacity. The Real being quite d$$$bled, and lying like a wreck upon the water, Mr. Matthews &s;ent a fire&s;hip to de&s;$roy her; but, the expe$i$nt did not take effect. The &s;hip ordered to cover this machine did not obey the &s;ignal; &s;o that the captain of the fire&s;hip was expo&s;ed to the whole fire of the enemy. Neverthele&s;s, he continued to advance until he found the ve&s;&s;el &s;inking; and being within a few yards of the Real, he &s;et fire to the fu&s;es. The &s;hip was immediately in flames, in the mid&s;t of which he and his lieutenant, with twelve men, peri&s;hed. This was like|wi&s;e
<PB N="647" REF="6500">
the fate of a Spani&s;h launch, which had been manned with fifty &s;ailors to pre|vent the fire&s;hip from running on board the Real. One &s;hip of the line, belonging to the Spani&s;h &s;quadron, &s;truck to captain Hawke, who &s;ent a lieutenant to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her: &s;he was afterwards retaken by the French &s;quadron; but was found &s;o di&s;abled, that they left her de&s;erted, and &s;he was next day burned by the order of admiral Matthews. At night the action cea&s;ed; and the ad|miral found his own &s;hip &s;o much damaged, that he moved his flag into another. Captain Cornwal fell in the engagement, after having exhibited a remarkable proof of courage and intrepidity: but, the lo&s;s of men was very incon&s;iderable. Next day the enemy appeared to leeward, and the admiral gave chace till night, when he brought to, that he might be joined by the &s;hips a-&s;tern. They were perc$ived again on the thirteenth at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and pur&s;ued till the evening. In the morning of the fourteenth, twenty &s;ail of them were &s;een di&s;tinctly, and Le&s;tock with his divi&s;ion had gained ground of them con&s;ider|ably, by noon; but, admiral Matthews di&s;played the &s;ignal for leaving off chace, and bore away for Port-mahon, to repair the damage he had &s;u&s;tained. Mean while the combined &s;quadrons continued their cour&s;e towards the coa&s;t of Spain. M. de Court, with his divi&s;ion, anchored in the road of Alicant, and Don Navarro &s;ailed into the harbour of Carthagena. Admiral Matthews, on his arrival at Minorca, accu&s;ed Le&s;tock of having mi&s;behaved on the day of action; &s;u&s;pended him from his office, and &s;ent him pri&s;oner to England, where, in his turn, he accu&s;ed his accu&s;er. Long before the engagement, the&s;e two o$$icers had expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t virulent re&s;entment again&s;t each other$ Matthews was brave, open, and undi&s;gui&s;ed; but proud, imperious, and pre|cipitate. Le&s;tock had &s;ignalized his courage on many occa&s;ions, and perfectly under&s;tood the whole di&s;cipline of the navy; but, he was cool, cunning and vindictive. He had been treated &s;uperciliou&s;ly by Matthews, and in revenge took advantage of his errors and precipitation. To gratify this pa&s;&s;ion, he betrayed the intere&s;t and glory of his country; for, it is not to be doubted, but that he might have come up in time to engage; and in that ca&s;e, the fleets of France and Spain would in all likelihood have been de&s;troyed: but, he intrenched him&s;elf within the punctilios of di&s;cipline, and &s;aw with plea&s;ure his antagoni&s;t expo&s;e him&s;elf to the hazard of death, ruin, and di&s;grace. Matthews him&s;elf, in the &s;equel, &s;acrificed his duty to his re&s;entment, in re&s;training Le&s;tock from pur&s;uing and attacking the combined &s;quadrons on the third day after the engagement, when they appeared di&s;abled and in manife&s;t di&s;order, and would have fallen an ea&s;y prey, had they been vigorou&s;ly attacked. One can hardly, without indignation, reflect upon tho&s;e in&s;tances, in which a community has &s;o &s;everely &s;uffered from the per&s;onal animo&s;ity of individuals. The mi&s;carriage off Toulon became the &s;ubject of a parliamentary inquiry in England. The commons, in an addre&s;s to the throne, de&s;ired that a court-martial might be ap|pointed to try the delinquents. By this time Le&s;tock had in his turn accu&s;ed Matthews, and all the captains of his divi&s;ion who mi&s;behaved in the day of battle. The court-martial was con&s;tituted, and proceeded to trial. Several commanders of &s;hips were ca&s;hiered: vice-admiral Le&s;tock was honourably acquitted, and admiral Matthews rendered incapable of &s;erving for the future in his maje&s;ty's navy. All the world knew that Le&s;tock kept aloof, and that Matthews ru&s;hed into the hotte&s;t part of the engagement. Yet, the former triumphed on his trial, and the latter narrowly e&s;caped the &s;entence of death

<P>The war in Germany, which had been almo&s;t extingui&s;hed in the la&s;t campaign, began to revive, and raged with redoubled violence. The emperor had &s;olicited the mediation of his Britannic maje&s;ty for compromi&s;ing the differen|ces between him and the court of Vienna. Prince William of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el had confered with the king of England on this &s;ubject; and a negotiation was begun at Hanau. The emperor offered to di&s;mi&s;s the French auxiliaries, provided the Au&s;trians would evacuate his hereditary dominions. Nay, prince William and lord Carteret, as plenipotentiaries, actually agreed to preliminaries, by which his Imperial maje&s;ty engaged to renounce the alliance of France, and throw him&s;elf into the arms of the maritime powers; to re&s;ign all preten&s;ions to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and to revive the vote of Bohemia in the electoral college; on condition of his being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dominions, and recogn zed as emperor by the queen of Hungary; and of his being accommo|dated with a monthly &s;ub&s;idy for his maintainance, as his own territories were exhau&s;ted and impoveri&s;hed by the war. By a &s;eparate article, the king or Great-Britain promi&s;ed to furni&s;h him with three hundred thou&s;and crowns, and to interpo&s;e his good offices with the queen of Hungary, that his electoral dominions &s;hould be favourably treated. The&s;e preliminaries, though &s;ettled, were not &s;igned. The court of Vienna was unwilling to part with their con|que&s;ts in Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate. The queen tru&s;ted too much to the valour of her troops, and the wealth of her allies, to li&s;ten to &s;uch terms of accommodation; and whatever arguments were u&s;ed with the king of Great-Britain, certain it is the negotiation was dropped, on pretence that the articles were di&s;approved by the mini&s;try of England. The emperor, invironed with di&s;tre&s;s, renewed his application to the king of Great-Britain; and even declared that he would refer his cau&s;e to the determination of the maritime powers: but, all his advances were di&s;countenanced; and the treaty of Worms di&s;pelled all hope of accommodation. In this manner did the Briti&s;h mini&s;try reject the faire&s;t opportunity that could po&s;&s;ibly occur, of terminating the war in Germany with honour and advantage, and of freeing their country from that in&s;ufferable burthen of expence under which &s;he groaned.</P>

<P>The inflexibility of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and its chief ally, proved &s;erviceable to the emperor. The forlorn &s;ituation of this unfortunate prince excited the compa&s;&s;ion of divers princes: they re&s;ented the in&s;olence with which the head of the empire had been treated by the court of Vienna; and they were alarmed at the increa&s;ing power of a family noted for pride, tyranny, and ambition. The&s;e con&s;iderations gave r$&s;e to the treaty of Frankfort, concluded in May be|tween the emperor, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, the king of Sweden as landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, and the elector-palatine. They engaged to pre&s;erve the con|&s;titutions of the empire, according to the treaty of We&s;tphalia, and to &s;up|port the emperor in his rank and dignity. They agreed to employ their good offices with the queen of Hungary, that &s;he might be induced to acknowledge the emperor, to re&s;tore his hereditary dominions, and give up the archives of the empire that were in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. They guaranteed to each other their re&s;pective territories: the di&s;putes about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the late emperor they referred to the deci&s;ion of the &s;tates of the empire: they promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t
<PB N="649" REF="6520">
one another in ca&s;e of being attacked; and they invited the king of Poland, the elector of Cologne, and the bi&s;hop of Liege, to accede to this treaty. Such was the confederacy that broke all the mea&s;ures which had been con|certed between the king of Great-Btitain and her Hungarian maje&s;ty, for the operations of the campaign. In the mean time, the French king declared was again&s;t this prince&s;s, on pretence of her being ob&s;tinately deaf to all terms of accommodation, and determined to carry the war into the territories of France. In her counter-declaration &s;he taxed him with having in&s;ringed the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagement with re&s;pect to the pragmatic &s;anction; with having &s;pirited up different pretenders to lay claim to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the late emperor; with having endeavoured to in&s;tigate the common enemy of Chri&s;tendom again&s;t her; and with having acted the incendiary in the north of Europe, that the czarina might be prevented from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, while his nu|merous armies over&s;pread the empire, and de&s;olated her hereditary countries. The&s;e recriminations were literally true. The hou&s;es of Bourbon and Au&s;tria have, for many centuries, been the common di&s;turbers and plagues of Europe.</P>

<P>The king of France, though in him&s;elf pacific and unenterpri&s;ing, was &s;timulated by his mini&s;try to ta&s;te the glory of conque&s;t in the Nether|lands, where he had a&s;&s;embled an army of one hundred and twenty thou&s;and men, provided with a very formidable train of artillery. The chief command was ve&s;ted in the marechal count de Saxe, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great military talents, and proved to be one of the mo&s;t fortunate generals of the age in which he lived. The allied forces, con&s;i&s;ting of Engli&s;h, Hanoverians, Dutch, and Au&s;|trians, to the number of &s;eventy thou&s;and effective men, were in the month of May a&s;&s;embled in the neighbourhood of Bru&s;&s;els, from whence they marched towards Oudenarde, and po&s;ted them&s;elves behind the Schelde, being unable to retard the progre&s;s of the enemy. The French monarch, attended by his favourite ladies, with all the pomp of ea&s;tern luxury, arrived at Li&s;le on the twelfth day of the &s;ame month; and in the adjacent plain reviewed his army. The &s;tates-general, alarmed at his preparations, had, in a conference with his amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, expre&s;&s;ed their apprehen&s;ions, and intreated his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty would de&s;i&s;t from his de&s;ign of attacking their barrier. Their remon&s;trances having proved ineffectual, they now &s;ent a mini&s;ter to wait upon that monarch, to enforce their former repre&s;entations and repeat their intreaties: but no regard was payed to his reque&s;t. The French king told him, he was determined to pro&s;ecute the war with vigour, as his moderation hitherto had &s;erved no other purpo&s;e but that of rendering his enemies more intractable. Accordingly his troops inve&s;ted Menin, which was in &s;even days &s;urrendered upon capitulation. Ypres, Fort Knocke, and Furnes, underwent the &s;ame fate; and, on the twenty-ninth day of June, the king of France entered Dun|kirk in triumph.</P>

<P>He had taken &s;uch precautions for the defence of Al&s;ace, which was guarded by con&s;iderable armies under the command of Coigni and Seckendorf, that he thought he had nothing to fear from the Au&s;trians in that quarter: be&s;ides, he had received &s;ecret a&s;&s;urances that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia would declare for the emperor; &s;o that he re&s;olved to pur&s;ue his conque&s;ts in the Nether|lands. But all his mea&s;ures were defeated by the &s;kill and activity of prince Charles of Lorraine, who found means to pa&s;s the Rhine, and obliged the French and Bavarian generals to retire to Lampertheim, that they might cover

<P>In the mean time, the &s;chemes of the Au&s;trian general were fru&s;|trated by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who, in the month of Augu&s;t, entered the electorate of Saxony, at the head of a numerous army. There he declared, in a public manife&s;to, that his aims were only to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the peace of the empire, and to &s;upport the dignity of its head. He a&s;&s;ured the inhabitants that they might depend upon his protection, in ca&s;e they &s;hould remain quiet; but threatened them with fire and &s;word &s;hould they pre&s;ume to oppo&s;e his arms. In a re&s;cript addre&s;&s;ed to his mini&s;ters at foreign courts, he accu&s;ed the queen of Hungary of ob&s;tinacy, in refu&s;ing to acknowledge the emperor, and re&s;tore his hereditary dominions: he &s;aid he had engaged in the league of Franckfort, to hinder the head of the empire from being oppre&s;&s;ed that he had no inten|tion to violate the peace of Bre$$au, of enter as a principal into this war: he affirmed, that his de&s;ign was to act as auxiliary to the emperor, and e&s;tabli&s;h the quiet of Germany. He penetrated into $word$ $$d undertook the &s;iege of Prague, the governor of which &s;urrendered $word$ and his garri&s;on pri|&s;oners of war on the &s;ixteenth day of September.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, count Seckendorf marching into Bava|ria, at the head of a &s;trong army, drove the Au&s;trians out of that electorate, and the emperor regained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Munich, his capital, on the twenty-&s;econd day of October. In Augu&s;t the French army pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at fort Louis, and inve&s;ted the &s;trong and important city of Fribourg, defended by general Damnitz, at the head of nine thou&s;and veterans. The king of France arrived in the camp on the eleventh day of October; and the &s;iege was carried on with uncommon vigour. The Au&s;trian governor made incredible efforts in the defence of the place, which he maintained until it was reduced to a heap of ruins, and one half of the garri&s;on de&s;troyed. At length, however, they were obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, after the trenches had been opened five and forty days, during which they had killed above fifteen thou&s;and of the be&s;iegers. With this conque&s;t, the French king clo&s;ed the campaign, and his army was cantoned along the Rhine, under the in&s;pection of the count de Maillebois. By the detachments drawn from the French army in Flanders, count Saxe had found him&s;elf con&s;iderably weaker than the con|federates: he threw up &s;trong intrenchments behind the Lys, where he re|mained on the defen&s;ive, until he was reinforced by the count de Clermont, who commanded a &s;eparate body on the &s;ide of Newport. The allies, to the number of &s;eventy thou&s;and, pa&s;&s;ed the Schelde, and advanced towards Helc|hin; but the enemy being &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, that they could not at|tack him with any pro&s;pect of advantage, they filed on in &s;ight of Tournay; and on the eighth day of Augu&s;t encamped in the plains of Li&s;le, in hope of drawing count Saxe from the &s;ituation in which he was &s;o &s;trongly fortified. Here they foraged for &s;everal days, and laid the open country under contribu|tion; but they made no attempt upon the place it&s;elf, which in all probability would have fallen into their hands had they inve&s;ted it at their fir&s;t approach; for then there was no other garri&s;on but two or three battalions of militia: but count Saxe &s;oon threw in a con&s;iderable reinforcement. The allies were unprovided with a train of battering cannon; and their commanders would not deviate from the u&s;ual forms of war. Be&s;ides, they were divided in their opi|nions, and de&s;pi&s;ed one another. General Wade, who commanded the Eng|li&s;h and Hanover$$$$$ was a vain, weak man, without confidence, weight, or authority; and the Au&s;trian general, the duke d'Aremberg, was a proud, rapacious glutton, devoid of talents and &s;entiment. After having remained for &s;ome time in &s;ight of Li&s;le, and made a general forage without mole&s;ta|tion, they retired to their former camp on the Schelde, from whence they &s;oon marched into winter-quarters. Count Saxe at length quitted his lines; and, by way of retaliation, &s;ent out detachments to ravage the Low-Countries, to the very gates of Ghent and Bruges. The conduct of the allied generals was &s;everely cen&s;ured in England, and ridiculed in France, not only in private conver&s;ation but al&s;o on their public theatres, where it became the &s;ubject of farces and pantomimes.</P>

<P>The campaign in Italy produced divers vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune. The king of Naples having a&s;&s;embled an army, joined count Gages, and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to in vindication of his conduct, which was a direct violation of the neutrality he had promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve. He maintained, that his moderation had been undervalued by the courts of London and Vienna; that his fron|tiers
<PB N="652" REF="6550">
were threatened with the calamities of war; and that the queen of Hun|gary made no &s;ecret of her intention to invade his dominions. This charge was not without foundation. The emi&s;&s;aries of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria endea|voured to excite a rebellion in Naples, which prince Lobkowitz had orders to favour by an inva&s;ion. This general was encamped at Monte Rotundo, in the neighbourhood of Rome, when, in the month of June, the confederates ad|vanced to Velletri. While the two armies remained in &s;ight of each other, prince Lobkowitz detached a &s;trong body of forces, under count Soro and general Gorani, who made an irruption into the province of Abruzzo, and took the city of Aquila, where they di&s;tributed a manife&s;to, in which the queen of Hungary exhorted the Neapolitans to &s;hake off the Spani&s;h yoke, and &s;ubmit again to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. This &s;tep, however, produced little or no effect; and the Au&s;trian detachment retired at the approach of the duke of Vieuville, with a &s;uperior number of forces. In Augu&s;t, count Brown, at the head of an Au&s;trian detachment, &s;urpri&s;ed Velletri in the night; and the king of the two Sicilies, with the duke of Modena, were in the utmo&s;t danger of being taken. They e&s;caped by a po&s;tern with great difficulty, and repaired to the quarters of count Gages, who performed the part of a great general on this occa&s;ion. He rallied the fugitives, di&s;pelled the pannic and confu&s;ion which had begun to prevail in his camp, and made a di&s;po&s;ition for cutting off the retreat of the Au&s;trians. Count Brown, finding him&s;elf in danger of being &s;urrounded, thought proper to &s;ecure his retreat, which he effected with great art and gallantry, carrying off a prodigious booty. Three thou&s;and Spaniards are &s;aid to have fallen in this action; and eight hundred men were taken, with &s;ome &s;tandards and colours. Count Mariani, a Neapolitan ge|neral, was among the pri&s;oners. The Au&s;trians lo&s;t about &s;ix hundred men; and general Novati fell into the hands of the enemy: but the exploit produced no con&s;equence of importance. The heats of autumn proved &s;o fatal to the Au&s;trians, who were not accu&s;tomed to the climate, that prince Lobkowitz &s;aw his army mouldering away, without any po&s;&s;ibility of its being recruited: be&s;ides, the country was &s;o drained, that he could no longer procure &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. Impelled by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he meditated a retreat. On the eleventh day of November, he decamped from Faiola, marched under the walls of Rome, pa&s;&s;ed the Tyber at Ponte Molle, formerly known by the name of the Pons Milvius, which he had ju&s;t time to break down behind him, when the vanguard of the Spaniards and Neapolitans appeared. Part of his rear|guard, however, was taken, with count Soro who commanded it, at Nocera; and his army &s;uffered greatly by de&s;ertion. Neverthele&s;s, he continued his retreat with equal &s;kill and expedition, pa&s;&s;ed the mountains of Gubio, and by the way of Viterbo reached the Bologne&s;e. The pope was altogether pa&s;&s;ive. In the beginning $word$ the campaign, he had care&s;&s;ed Lobkowitz; and now he received the king of the two Sicilies with marks of the warme&s;t affection. That $word$ having vi&s;ited the chief curio&s;ities of Rome, returned to Naples, leaving part of his troops under the command of count Gages.</P>

the city of Nice, without oppo&s;ition. In April, they attacked the king of Sar|dinia, who, with twenty thou&s;and men, was &s;trongly intrenched among the mountains at Villa Franca. The action was ob&s;tinate and bloody; but their numbers and per&s;everance prevailed. He was obliged to abandon his po&s;ts, and embark on board of the Briti&s;h &s;quadron, which tran&s;ported him and his troops to Vado. The intention of Don Philip was to penetrare through the territories of Genoa into the Milane&s;e; but admiral Matthews, who hovered with a &s;trong &s;quadron on that coa&s;t, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the republic, declaring, that &s;hould the combined army be &s;uffered to pa&s;s through her dominions, the king of Great-Britain would con&s;ider &s;uch a &s;tep as a breach of their neutrality. The &s;enate, intimidated by this intimation, intreated the princes to de&s;i&s;t from their de&s;ign; and they re&s;olved to chu&s;e another route. They defiled towards Piedmont, and a&s;&s;aulted the &s;trong po&s;t of Chateau-Dauphine, defended by the king of Sardinia in per&s;on. After a de&s;perate attack, in which they lo&s;t four thou&s;and men, the place was taken; the garri&s;on of Demont &s;ur|rendered at di&s;cretion, and the whole country of Piedmont was laid under con|tribution. His Sardinian maje&s;ty was not in a condition to hazard a battle; and therefore po&s;ted him&s;elf at Saluzzes, in order to cover his capital. The combined army advanced to the &s;trong and important town of Coni, which was inve&s;ted in the beginning of September. Baron Leutrum the governor made an ob&s;tinate defence, and the &s;ituation of the place was &s;uch as rendered the &s;iege difficult, tedious, and bloody. The king of Sardinia being reinforced by ten thou&s;and Au&s;trians, under general Pallavicini, advanced to its relief, and a battle en&s;ued. The action was maintained with great vigour on both &s;ides, till night, when his maje&s;ty finding it impracticable to force the enemy's in|trenchments, retired in good order to his camp at Mura&s;&s;o. He afterwards found means to throw a reinforcement and &s;upply of provi&s;ions into Coni; and the heavy rains that fell at this period, not only retarded, but even di&s;pirited the be&s;iegers. Neverthele&s;s, the princes per&s;i&s;ted in their de&s;ign, notwith&s;tanding a dea$th of provi&s;ions, and the approach of winter, till the latter end of No|vember, when the chevalier de $o$o entered the place with &s;ix hundred fre&s;h men. This incident was no &s;ooner known, than the princes abandoned their enterprize; and leaving their &s;i$k and wounded to the mercy of the Pied|monte&s;e, marched back to Demont. Having di&s;mantled the fortifications of this place, they retreated with great precipitation to Dauphin&edot;, and were dreadfully harra&s;&s;ed by the Vaudois and light troops in the &s;ervice of his Sar|dinian maje&s;ty, who now again &s;aw him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Piedmont. The French troops were quartered in Dauphine: but Don Philip &s;till maintained his footing in Savoy, the inhabitants of which he fleeced without mercy.</P>

<P>After the action at $oulon nothing of con&s;equence was atchieved by the Briti&s;h &s;quadron in the Mediterranean; and indeed the naval power of Great Britain was, during the &s;u$$er, quite inactive. In the month of June, commodore An$on returned from his voyage of three years and nine months, in which he had &s;urrounded the terraqueo$$ globe. We have formerly ob&s;erved, that he &s;ailed with a &s;mall &s;quadron to the South-Sea, in order to annoy the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements of Chil$ and Peru.

He made prize of &s;everal ve&s;&s;els; took and burned the little town of P$yta, &s;et fail from the coa&s;t of Mexico, for the Philippine i&s;les; and in this pa&s;&s;age the Glouce&s;ter was abandoned and &s;unk: the other ve&s;&s;els had been de&s;troyed, for want of men to navigate them, &s;o that nothing now rem$$ned out the commodore's own &s;hip the Centurion, and that but very indifferently manned; for, the crews had been horribly thinned by &s;ickne&s;s. Incredible were the hard&s;hips and mi&s;ery they &s;u&s;tained from the &s;hattered condition of the &s;hips, and the &s;corbutic di&s;order, when they reached the plentiful i&s;land of Tinian, where they were &s;upplied with the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments. Thence they pro&s;ecured their voyage to the river of Can|ton in China, where the commodore ordered the &s;hip to be &s;heathed, and found means to procure a reinforcement of &s;ailors. The chief object of his attention was the rich annual &s;hip that &s;ails $span$ in Mexico, and Manila out of the Philippine i&s;lands. In $word$ $word$ intercepting her, he &s;et &s;ail from Canton, and &s;teered his cour&s;e back to the &s;traights of Manilla, where &s;he actually fell into his hands, after a $$ort but vigorous engagement. The prize was called Neu&s;tra Signora de Cabalong$, mounted with forty guns, manned with &s;ix hundred &s;ailors, and loaded with trea&s;ure and effects to the value of three hundred and thirteen thou&s;and pounds &s;terling: with this windfall, he returned to Canton; from whence he proceeded to the Cape of Good-Hope, and pro&s;ecuted his voyage to England, where he arrived in &s;afety. Though this fortunate commander enriched him&s;elf by an occurrence that may be termed almo&s;t accidental, the Briti&s;h nation was not indemnified for the expence of the expedition, and the original de&s;ign was intirely defeated. Had the Manilla &s;hip e&s;caped the vigilance of the Engli&s;h commodore, he might have been, at his return to England, laid a&s;ide as a &s;uperannuated cap|tain, and died in ob&s;curity: but, his great wealth inve&s;ted him with con&s;ider|able influence, and added lu&s;tre to his talents. He &s;oon became the oracle which was con&s;ulted in all naval deliberations; and the king rai&s;ed him to the dignity of a peerage. In July, Sir John Balchen, an admiral of approved valcur and great experience, failed from Spithead with a &s;trong &s;quadron, in que&s;t of an opportunity to attack the French fleet at Bre&s;t, under the com|mand of M. de Rochambault. In the bay of Bi&s;cay he was overtaken by a violent &s;torm that di&s;per&s;ed the &s;hips, and drove them up the Engli&s;h channel. Admiral Stewart, with the greater part of them, arrived at Plymouth; but Sir John Balchen's own &s;hip the Victory, which was counted the mo&s;t beautiful fir&s;t rate in the world, foundered at &s;ea; and this brave commander peri&s;hed with all his officers, volunteers, and crew, amounting to eleven hundred choice &s;eamen. On the fourth day of October, after the &s;iege of Friburg, the mar&s;hal duke de B$lle$&s;le, and his brother, happened, in their way to Berlin, to halt at a village in the fore&s;t of Hartz, dependant on the electorate of Hanover.

<P>The di&s;&s;entions in the Briti&s;h cabinet were now ripened into another revolution in the mini&s;try. Lord Carteret, who was by this time earl of Gran|ville, in con&s;equence of his mother's death, had engro&s;&s;ed the royal favour &s;o much, that the duke of N&mdash;and his brother are &s;aid to have taken um|brage at his influence and greatne&s;s. He had incurred the re&s;entment of tho&s;e who were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of Patriots, and intirely forfeited his popularity. The two brothers were very powerful by their parliamentary inte|re&s;t: they knew their own &s;trength, and engaged in a political alliance with the leading men in the oppo&s;ition, again&s;t the prime-mini&s;ter and his mea&s;ures. This coalition was dignified with the epithet of "The Broad Bottom," as if it had been e&s;tabli&s;hed on a true con&s;titutional foundation, comprehending indi|viduals of every cla&s;s, without di&s;tinction of party. The appellation, however, which they a&s;&s;umed, was afterwards converted into a term of deri&s;ion. The earl of G&mdash;perceiving the gathering &s;torm, and fore&s;eeing the impo&s;&s;ibility of with&s;tanding &s;uch an oppo&s;ition in parliament, wi&s;ely avoided the impending danger and di&s;grace, by a voluntary re&s;ignation of his employments. The earl of Harrington &s;ucceeded him as &s;ecretary of &s;tate. The duke of Bedford was appointed fir&s;t lord of the admiralty, and the earl of Che&s;terfield declared lord-lieutenant of Ireland. The lords Gower and Cobham were re e&s;tabli&s;hed in the offices they had re&s;igned: Mr. Littleton was admitted as a commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea&s;ury; even Sir John Hynd-Cotton accepted of a place at court; and Sir John Phillips &s;at at the board of trade and plantations, though he &s;oon renounced this employment. This was rather a change of men than of mea|&s;ures, and turned out to the ea&s;e and advantage of the &s;overeign; for, his views were no longer thwarted by an ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition in parliament. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened on the twenty-eighth day of November, in the u&s;ual manner; and the commons unanimou&s;ly granted about &s;ix millions and an half for the &s;er|vice of the en&s;uing year, to be rai&s;ed by the land, the malt, and the &s;alt-taxes, the &s;inking-fund, and an additional duty on wines. In January, the earl of Che&s;terfield &s;et out for the Plague, with the character of amba&s;&s;ador-extraordi|nary, to per&s;uade, if po&s;&s;ible, the &s;tates-general to engage heartily in the war. About the &s;ame time, a treaty of quadruple alliance was &s;igned at War&s;aw, by the queen of Hungary, the king of Poland, and the maritime powers. This was a mutual guaranty of the dominions belonging to the contracting parties; but, his Poli&s;h maje&s;ty was paid for his concurrence, with an annual &s;ub&s;idy of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds, two thirds of which were defrayed by England, and the remainder was di&s;bur&s;ed by the United-Provinces <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Robert earl of Oxford, late prime mini&s;ter, died in March, after having for a very &s;hort time enjoyed a pen&s;ion of four thou&s;and pounds granted by the crown, in con&s;ideration of his pa&s;t &s;ervi|ces. Though he had for &s;uch a length of time di|rected the application of the public trea&s;ure, his circum&s;tances were not affluent; he was liberal in his di&s;po&s;ition, and had &s;uch a number of rapa|cious dependants to gratify, that little was left for his own private occa&s;ions.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> The bu&s;ine&s;s of the Briti&s;h p$r$$ament being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed in the beginning of May$ and immediately after the pro$ogation, the king &s;et out for Hanover. The death of the emperor Charles VII. which happened in the month of January, had intirely changed the fa$e of affairs in the empire, and all the princes of Germany were in commotion. The grand duke of Tu&s;cany, con&s;ort to her Hungarian maje&s;ty, was immediately declared a candidate for the imperial crown: while his preten&s;ions were warmly oppo&s;ed by the French king and his allies. The court of Vienna taking advantage of the late emperor's death$ &s;ent an army to invade Bavaria in the month of March, under the conduct of general Bathiani, who routed the French and Palatine troops at $word$ took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Rain, &s;urrounded and di&s;|armed &s;ix thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians in the neighbourhood of Ingold&s;tadt, and drove the Bavarian forces out of the electorate. The young elector was obliged to aban|don his capital, and retire to Augsburgh, where he found him&s;elf in danger of lo&s;ing all his dominions. In this emergency, he yielded to the earne&s;t &s;olicita|tions of the empre&s;s his mother, inforced by the advice of his uncle the elector of Cologne, and of his general count Seckendorff, who exhorted him to be reconciled to the court of Vienna. A negotiation was immediately begun at Fue$&s;en, where in April the treaty was concluded. The queen con&s;ented to recognize the imperial dignity, as having been ve&s;ted in the per&s;on of his fa|ther; to acknowledge his mother as empre&s;s dowager; to re&s;tore his dominions, with all the fortre&s;&s;es, artillery, &s;tores, and ammunition, which &s;he had taken: on the other hand, he renounced all claim to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of her father, and became guarantee of the pragmatic &s;anction. He acknowledged the validity of the electoral vote of Bohemia in the per&s;on of the queen; and engaged to give his vote for the grand duke, at the en&s;uing election of a king of the Ro|mans. Until that &s;hould be determined, both parties agreed that Ingold&s;tadt &s;hould be garri&s;oned by neutral troops; and that Braunau and Schardingen, with all the country lying between the Inn and the Saltza, &s;hould remain in the queen's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, though without prejudice to the civil government, or the elector's revenue. In the mean time he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the auxiliaries that were in his pay, and they were permitted to retire without mole&s;tation.</P>

<P>The court of Vienna had now &s;ecured the votes of all the electors, except tho&s;e of Brandenburgh and the Palatinate. Neverthele&s;s, France a&s;&s;embled a powerful army in the neighbourhood of Franckfort, in order to influence the election. But the Au&s;trian army$ commanded by the grand duke in per&s;on, marched thither from the Danube; and the prince of Conti was obliged to repa&s;s the Rhine at Nordlingen. Then the great duke repaired to Franckfort, where, on the &s;econd day of September he was by a majority of voices declared king of the Romans, and emperor of Germany. Mean while$ the king of Pru&s;&s;ia had made great progre&s;s in the conque&s;t of Sile&s;ia. The campaign began in January, when the Hungarian in&s;urgents were obliged to retire into Moravia. In the following month the Pru&s;&s;ian general Lehwald defeated a body of twelve thou&s;and Au&s;trians, commanded by general Hel&s;rich: the town of Ratibor was taken by a&s;&s;ault; and the king entered Sile&s;ia in May, at the head of &s;eventy thou&s;and men. Prince Charles of Lorraine being joined by the duke of Saxe-Wei&s;&s;enfels and twenty thou&s;and Saxons, penetrated into S$le&s;ia by the defiles of Land&s;hut; and were attacked by his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty
<PB N="657" REF="6600">
in the plains of Strigan, near Friedbergh. The battle was maintained from morning till noon, when the Saxons giving way, prince Charles was obliged to retire with the lo&s;s of twelve thou&s;and men, and a great number of colours, &s;tandards, and artillery. This victory, obtained on the fourth day of June, complete as it was, did not prove deci&s;ive; for, though the victor transferred the &s;eat of the war into Bohemia, and maintained his army by rai&s;ing contributions in that country, the Au&s;trians re&s;olved to hazard another engagement. Their aim was to &s;urpri&s;e him in his camp at Sohr, which they attacked on the thirtieth of September, at day-break; but they met with &s;uch a warm reception, that notwith&s;tanding their repeated efforts during the &s;pace of four hours, they were repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable damage; and retreated to Jaromire, leaving five thou&s;and killed upon the &s;pot, be&s;ides two thou&s;and that were taken, with many &s;tandards and twenty pieces of cannon. The lo&s;s of this battle was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the avarice of the irregulars, who having penetrated into the Pru&s;&s;ian camp, began to pillage with great eagerne&s;s, giving the king an op|portunity to rally his di&s;ordered troops, and re&s;tore the battle: neverthele&s;s, they retired with the plunder of his baggage, including his military che&s;t, the officers of his chancery, his-own &s;ecretary, and all the papers of his cabinet.</P>

<P>After this action his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty returned to Berlin; and breathed nothing but peace and moderation. In Augu&s;t he had &s;igned a con|vention with the king of Great-Britain, who became guarantee of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Sile&s;ia, as yielded by the treaty of Bre&s;lau; and he promi&s;ed to vote for the grand duke of Tu&s;cany at the election of an emperor. This was intended as the ba&s;is of a more general accommodation. But, he now pretended to have received undoubted intelligence, that the king of Poland and the queen of Hungary had agreed to invade Brandenburgh with three different armies; and, that for this purpo&s;e his Poli&s;h maje&s;ty had demanded of the czarina the &s;uc|cours &s;tipulated by treaty between the two crowns. Alarmed, or &s;eemingly alarmed at this information, he &s;ollicited the maritime powers to fulfil their engagements; and interpo&s;e their good offices with the court of Peter&s;burgh. Yet, far from waiting for the re&s;ult of the&s;e remon&s;trances, he made a &s;udden irruption into Lu&s;atia, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gorlitz, and obliged prince Charles of Lorraine to retire before him into Bohemia. Then he entered Leip&s;ick, and layed Saxony under contribution. The king of Poland, unable to re&s;i&s;t the torrent, quitted his capital and took refuge in Prague. His troops, reinforced by a body of Au&s;trians, were defeated at Pirna on the fifteenth day of December; and his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty became ma&s;ter of Dr$&s;den without further oppo&s;ition. The king of Poland, thus deprived of his hereditary dominions, was fain to acquie&s;ce in &s;uch terms as the conqueror thought proper to impo&s;e; and the treaty of Dre&s;den was concluded under the mediation of his Britannic maje&s;ty. By this convention the king of Pru&s;&s;ia retained all the contributions he had levied in Saxony; and was intitled to a million of German crowns, to be payed by his Poli&s;h maje&s;ty at the next fair of Leip&s;ick. He and the elector Palatine con|&s;ented to acknowledge the grand duke as emperor of Germany; and this la&s;t confirmed to his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty certain privileges de non evocando, which had been granted by the late emperor, with regard to &s;ome territories po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, though not belonging to the electorate of Brandenburgh$

<P>Though the French king could not prevent the elevation of the grand duke to the Imperial throne$ he re&s;olved to humble the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, by making a conque&s;t of the Netherlands. A prodigious army was there $&s;&s;embled, under the au$pices of mar$chal count de Saxe; and his mo&s;t chri&s;tian $aj$$ty, with the dauph$n, arriving in the camp, they inve&s;ted the &s;trong town of Tournay on the thirtieth day of April. The Dutch garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of e$g$$ thou&s;and men, commanded by the old baron Dorth, who made a vigorous defence. The duke of Cumberland a&s;&s;umed the chief command of the allied army a&s;&s;embled at Soignies; and he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the advice of the count Kon$g&s;eg, an Au&s;trian general, and the prince of Waldeck, commander of the Dutch forces. Their army was greatly inferior in number to that of the enemy; neverthele&s;s, they re&s;olved to march $o the relief of Tournay. They accordingly advanced to Le$$e$ and on the twenty-eighth day of April took po&s;t at Maulbre, in $ight of the French army, which was encamped on an eminence from the village of Antoine to a large wood beyond Vezon, having Fontenoy in their front. Next day was employed by the allies in driving the enemy from &s;ome outpo&s;ts, and clearing the de$iles through which they were obliged to advance to the attack; while the French completed their batteries, and made the mo&s;t formidable preparations for their reception. On the thirtieth day of April the duke of Cumberland having made the proper di&s;po&s;itions, began his march to the enemy at two o'clock in the morning: a bri&s;k cannonade en|&s;ued; and about nine both armies were engaged. The Briti&s;h infantry drove the French beyond their lines; but, the left wing failing in the attack on the village of Fontenoy, and the cavalry forbearing to advance on the flanks, they mea&s;ured back their ground with &s;ome di&s;order, from the prodigious $ire of the French batteries. They rallied, however, and returning to the charge with redou$led $rdour, repul&s;ed the enemy to their camp with great &s;laughter; but, being wholly un&s;upported by the other wing, and expo&s;ed both in front and flank to a dreadful fire which did great execution, the duke was obliged to make the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions for a retreat about three o'clock in the afternoon; and this was effected in tolerable order. The battle was fought with great ob&s;tinacy, and the carnage on both &s;ides was very con&s;iderable. The allies lo&s;t about twelve thou&s;and men, including a good number of officers; and among the&s;e lieute|nant-general Campbel, and major-general Pon&s;onby. The victory co&s;t the French almo&s;t an equal number of lives; and although the attack was gene|rally judged ra&s;h and precipitate, the Briti&s;h and Hanoverian troops fought with &s;uch intrepid$ty and per&s;everance, that if they had been properly &s;u&s;tained by t$e D$tch forces, and their flanks covered by the cavalry, the French, in all likelihood, would have been obliged to abandon their enterprize. The duke of Cumberland left his &s;$ck and wounded to the humanity of the victors; and retiring to Aeth, encamped in an advantageous &s;ituation at Le&s;&s;ines. The garri&s;on of Tournay, though now deprived of all hope of &s;uccour, maintained the place to the twenty-fir&s;t day of June, when the governor obtained an honourable capitulation. After the conque&s;t of Tournay, which was di&s;mantled, the duke of Cumberland apprehending the enemy had a de&s;ign upon Ghent,
<PB N="659" REF="6620">
&s;ent a detachment of four thou&s;and men to reinforce the garri&s;on of that city$ but, they fell into an ambu&s;cade at Pas-du-m&ecirc;le; and were killed or taken, except a few dragoons that e&s;caped to O&s;tend: on that very night, which was the twelfth of June, Ghent was &s;urpri&s;ed by a detachment of the French army. Then they inve&s;ted O&s;tend, which, though defended by an Engli&s;h garri&s;on, and open to the &s;ea, was after a &s;hort &s;iege &s;urrendered by capitulation on the four|teenth day of Augu&s;t. Dendermonde, Oudenarde, Newport, and Aeth, underwent the &s;ame fate; while the allied army lay intrenched beyond the canal of Antwerp: and the French king having &s;ubdued the greate&s;t part of the Au&s;trian Netherlands, returned to Paris, which he entered in triumph.</P>

<P>The campaign in Italy was unpropitious to the queen of Hungary and the king of Sardinia. Count Gages pa&s;&s;ed the Appenines, and entered the &s;tate of Lucca; from thence he proceeded by the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Genoa to Le&s;tride-Levante. The junction of the two armies was thus accompli&s;hed, and reinforced with ten thou&s;and Genoe&s;e: mean while prince Lobkowitz decamped from Modena, and took po&s;t at Parma; but, he was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by count Schuylemberg, and &s;ent to command the Au&s;trians in Bohemia. The Spaniards entered the Milane&s;e without further oppo&s;ition. Count Gages with thirty thou&s;and men took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Serravalle; and advancing towards Placentia, obliged the Au&s;trians to retire under the cannon of Tortona: but, when Don Philip, at the head of forty thou&s;and troops, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Acqui, the king of Sardinia and the Au&s;trian general, unable to &s;tem the torrent, retreated behind the Tanaro. The &s;trong citadel of Tortona was taken by the Spaniards, who likewi&s;e reduced Parma and Placentia; and forcing the pa&s;&s;age of the Tanaro, compelled his Sardinian maje&s;ty to take &s;helter on the other &s;ide of the Po. Then Pavia was won by &s;calade; and the city of Milan &s;ubmitted to the infant, though the Au&s;trian garri&s;on &s;till maintained the citadel: all Piedmont, on both &s;ides of the Po, as far as Turin, was reduced, and even that capital threatened with a &s;iege: &s;o that by the month of October the terri|tories belonging to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in Italy, were wholly &s;ubdued; and the king of Sardinia &s;tripped of all his dominions: yet he continued firm and true to his engagements, and deaf to all propo&s;als of a &s;eparate accommodation.</P>

<P>The naval tran&s;actions of Great-Britain were in the cour&s;e of this year remarkably &s;pirited. In the Mediterranean, admiral Rowley had &s;ucceeded Matthews in the command; and Savona, Genoa, Final, St. Remo, with Ba&s;tia the capital of Cor&s;ica, were bombarded: &s;everal Spani&s;h &s;hips were taken; but he could not prevent the &s;afe arrival of their rich Havannah &s;quadron at Corunna. Commodore Barnet in the Ea&s;t-Indies made prize of &s;everal French &s;hips richly laden; and commodore Town&s;hend, in the latitude of Martinico, took about thirty merchant &s;hips belonging to the enemy, under convoy of four &s;hips of war, two of which were de&s;troyed. The Engli&s;h privateers likewi&s;e met with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s. But the mo&s;t important atchievement was the conque&s;t of Loui&s;burgh on the i&s;le of Cape-Breton, in North-America; a place of great con&s;equence, which the French had fortified at a prodigious expence. The &s;cheme of reducing this fortre&s;s was planned in Bo&s;ton, recommended by their general a&s;&s;embly, and approved by his maje&s;ty, who &s;ent in&s;tructions to com|modore Warren, &s;tationed off the Leeward-I&s;lands, to &s;ail for the northern parts of America, and co-operate with the forces of New-England in this expedition.
<PB N="660" REF="6630">
A body of &s;ix thou&s;and men was formed under the conduct of Mr. Pepperel, a trader of Pi&s;eataway, who&s;e influence was exten&s;ive in that country; though he was a man of little or no education, and utterly unacquainted with military operations. In April Mr. Warren arrived at Can&s;o with ten &s;hips of war; and the troops of New-England being embarked in tran&s;ports, &s;ailed immediately for the i&s;le of Cape-Breton, where they landed without oppo&s;ition. The enemy abandoned their grand battery, which was detached from the town; and the immediate &s;eizure of it contributed in a good mea&s;ure to the &s;ucce&s;s of the enterprize. While the American troops, reinforced by eight hundred marines, carried on their approaches by land, the &s;quadron blocked up the place by &s;ea in &s;uch a manner, that no &s;uccours could be introduced. A French &s;hip of the line, with &s;ome &s;maller ve&s;&s;els de&s;tined for the relief of the garri&s;on, were inter|cepted and taken by the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers; and indeed, the reduction of Loui&s;burgh was chiefly owing to the vigilance and activity of Mr. Warren, one of the brave&s;t and be&s;t officers in the &s;ervice of England. The operations of the &s;iege were wholly conducted by the engineers and officers who commanded the Briti&s;h marines; and the Americans being ignorant of war, were contented to act under their directions. The town being con&s;iderably damaged by the bombs and bullets of the be&s;iegers, and the governor de&s;pairing of relief, capitulated on the &s;eventeenth day of June, when the city of Loui&s;burgh, and the i&s;le of Cape-Breton, were &s;urrendered to his Britannic maje&s;ty. The garri&s;on and inhabitants engaged, that they would not bear arms for twelve months again&s;t Great-Britain or her allies; and being embarked in fourteen cartel &s;hips, were tran&s;|ported to Rochfort. In a few days after the &s;urrender of Loui&s;burgh, two French Ea&s;t-India &s;hips, and another from Peru laden with trea&s;ure, failed into the harbour, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that it &s;till belonged to France; and were taken by the Engli&s;h &s;quadron.</P>

<P>The news of this conque&s;t being tran&s;mitted to England, Mr. Pep|perel was preferred to the dignity of a knight-baronet; and congratulatory addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented to the king on the &s;ucce&s;s of his maje&s;ty's arms. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cape-Breton was, doubtle&s;s, a valuable acqui&s;ition to Great-Britain. It not only di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the French in their fi&s;hery and navigation, but removed all fears of encroachment and rival&s;hip from the Engli&s;h fi&s;hers on the banks of Newfoundland. It freed New-England from the terrors of a dangerous neighbour; overawed the Indians of that country; and &s;ecured the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Acadia to the crown of Great-Britain. The plan of this conque&s;t was originally layed by Mr. Auchmury, judge-advocate of the court of admiralty in New-England. He demon&s;trated, that the reduction of Cape-Breton would put the Engli&s;h in &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fi&s;hery of North-America, which would annually return to Great-Britain two millions &s;terling for the manufactures yearly &s;hipped to the plantations; employ many thou&s;and families that were otherwi&s;e un&s;er|viceable to the public; increa&s;e the &s;hipping and mariners; extend navigation; out off all communication between France and Canada by the river St. Laurence; &s;o that Quebec would fall of cour&s;e into the hands of the Engli&s;h, who might expel the French entirely from America, open a corre&s;pondence with the re|mote Indians, and render them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the profitable fur trade, which was now engro&s;&s;ed by the enemy. The natives of New-England acquired great glory from the &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize. Britain, which had in &s;ome
<PB N="661" REF="6640">
in&s;tances behaved like a &s;tepmother to her own colonies, was now convinced of their importance; and treated tho&s;e as brethren whom &s;he had too long con|&s;idered as aliens and rivals. Circum&s;tanced as the nation is, the legi&s;lature cannot too tenderly cheri&s;h the intere&s;ts of the Briti&s;h plantations in America. They are inhabited by a brave, hardy, indu&s;trious people, animated with an active &s;pirit of commerce; in&s;pired with a noble zeal for liberty and independence. The trade of Great-Britain, clogged with heavy taxes and impo&s;itions, has for &s;ome time langui&s;hed in many valuable branches. The French have under&s;old our cloths, and &s;poiled our markets in the Levant. Spain is no longer &s;upplied as u&s;ual with the commodities of England: the exports to Germany mu&s;t be con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, by the mi&s;under&s;tanding between Great-Britain and the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; con&s;equently her greate&s;t re&s;ource mu&s;t be in her communi|cation with her own colonies, which con&s;ume her manufactures, and make immen&s;e returns in &s;ugar, rum, tobacco, fi&s;h, timber, naval &s;tores, iron, furs, drugs, rice, and indigo. The &s;outhern plantations likewi&s;e produce &s;ilk; and with due encouragement might furni&s;h every thing that could be expected from the mo&s;t fertile &s;oil and the happie&s;t climate. The continent of North-America, if properly cultivated, will prove an inexhau&s;tible fund of wealth and &s;trength to Great-Britain; and perhaps it may become the la&s;t a&s;ylum of Briti&s;h liberty, when the nation is en&s;laved by dome&s;tic de&s;poti&s;m or foreign dominion; when her &s;ub&s;tance is wa&s;ted, her &s;pirit broke, and the laws and con&s;titution of England are no more: then tho&s;e colonies &s;ent off by our fathers may receive and entertain their &s;ons as haple&s;s exiles and ruined refugees.</P>

<P>While the continent of Europe and the i&s;les of America were thus expo&s;ed to the ravages of war, and &s;ubjected to &s;uch vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, Great-Britain underwent a dangerous convul&s;ion in her own bowels. The &s;on of the chevalier de St. George, fired with ambition, and animated with the hope of a&s;cending the throne of his ance&s;tors, re&s;olved to make an effort for that purpo&s;e, which, though it might not be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hould at lea&s;t a&s;toni&s;h all Chri&s;tendom. Whether he was invited and encouraged by the &s;ollicitations and promi&s;es of tho&s;e in Great-Britain, who wi&s;hed well to his father's hou&s;e, or chiefly depended upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French monarch; or was induced by the&s;e concurring motives, we &s;hall not pretend to determine; but, if we judge from appearances, he &s;eems to have projected a revolution on the &s;trength of his own per&s;onal intere&s;t and qualifications. He knew, indeed, the principles and characters of tho&s;e individuals who adhered to the Stuart family; becau&s;e they had always in &s;ecret maintained a corre&s;pondence with his father: and, in all probability, he was cajoled by the &s;anguine mi&s;repre&s;entations of a few adventurers who hoped to profit by the expedition. They a&s;&s;ured him, that the whole nation was di&s;affected to the reigning family: that the people could no longer bear the immen&s;e load of taxes, which was daily increa&s;ing; and, that the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons of the kingdom would gladly &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of crouding to his &s;tandard. He was at the &s;ame time regaled with the promi&s;e of powerful &s;uccours from France, though the mini&s;try of that kingdom were never hearty in his cau&s;e: neverthele&s;s they fore&s;aw, that his ap|pearance in England would embarra&s;s the government, and make a con&s;iderable diver&s;ion in their favour. Certain it is, that if he had been properly &s;upported, he could not have found a more favourable opportunity of exciting an inte&s;tine
<PB N="662" REF="6650">
commotion in Great-Britain; for Scotland was quite unfurni&s;hed with troops, king George was in Germany, and great part of the Highlanders were keen for in&s;urrection. T$eir natural principles were on this occa&s;ion &s;timulated by the &s;ugge&s;tions of revenge. At the beginning of the war a regiment of tho&s;e people had been formed, and tran&s;ported with the re&s;t of the Briti&s;h troops to Flanders. Before they were embarked, a number of them de&s;erted with their arms, on pretence, that they had been decoyed into the &s;ervice, by promi&s;es and a&s;&s;urances that they &s;hould never be &s;ent abroad; and this was really the ca&s;e. They were overtaken by a body of hor&s;e, per&s;uaded to &s;ubmit, brought back to London p$nioned like malefactors, and tried for de&s;ertion. Three were &s;hot to death i$ terrorem; and the re&s;t were &s;ent in exile to the plantations. Tho&s;e who &s;uffered were per&s;ons of &s;ome con&s;equence in their own country; and their fate was deeply re$e$ted by the clans to which they belonged. It was con&s;idered as a national outrage; and the Highlanders, who are naturally vindictive, waited impatiently for an opportunity of vengeance.</P>

<P>The young pretender being furni&s;hed with a &s;um of money, and a &s;upply of arms by the mini&s;try of France, embarked on board of a &s;mall frigate at port St. Lazare, accompanied by the marquis of Tullibardine, Sir Thomas Sheridan, with a few other Iri&s;h and Scotti&s;h adventurers; and &s;etting &s;a$l on the fourteenth of July, was off Bellei&s;le joined by the Elizabeth, a French &s;hip of war mounted with &s;ixty-&s;ix guns, as his convoy. Their de&s;ign was to &s;ail round Ireland, and land in the we&s;tern part of Scotland; but falling in with the Lion, an Engli&s;h &s;hip of the line, a very ob&s;tinate and bloody action en&s;ued. The Elizabeth was &s;o di&s;abled that &s;he could not pro&s;ecute the voyage, and with difficulty reached the harbour of Bre&s;t; but the Lion was &s;hattered to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he floated like a wreck upon the water. Prince Charles in the frigate continued his cour&s;e to the we&s;tern i&s;les of Scotland; and landing on the coa&s;t of Lochaber, was in a little time joined by a con&s;iderable number of hardy mountainers, under their re&s;pective chiefs or leaders. Some of tho&s;e, however, on whom he principally depended, now &s;tood aloof, either fluctuating in their principles, a&s;toni&s;hed at the boldne&s;s of the undertaking, or &s;tartled at the remon&s;trances of their friends, who did not fail to repre&s;ent in aggravated colours, all the danger of embarking in &s;uch a de&s;perate enterprize. Had the government acted with proper vigour when they received intelligence of his arrival, the adventure mu&s;t have been cru&s;hed in embrio before any con&s;idera|ble number of his adherents could have been brought together; but, the lords of the regency &s;eemed to &s;light the information, and even to &s;u&s;pect the integrity of tho&s;e by whom it was conveyed. They were &s;oon convinced of their mi&s;take. Prince Charles, having a&s;&s;embled about fifteen hundred men, encamped in the neighbourhood of Fort William; and immediately ho&s;tilities were commenced. A detachment from his main body &s;urpri&s;ed two companies of new-rai&s;ed &s;oldiers, who, with their officer, were di&s;armed after an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute; another captain of the king$s forces falling into their hands, was courteou&s;ly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with one of the pretender's manife&s;tos, and a pa&s;&s;port for his per&s;onal &s;afety. The admini&s;tration was now effectually alarmed. The lords of the regency i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, offering a reward of thirty thou&s;and pounds to any per&s;on who &s;hould apprehend the prince-adventurer; and a courier was di&s;patched to Hol|land to ha&s;ten the return of his maje&s;ty, who arrived in England about the
<PB N="663" REF="6660">
latter end of Augu&s;t. A requi&s;ition was made of the &s;ix thou&s;and Dutch auxiliaries; and &s;everal Briti&s;h regiments were recalled from the Netherlands. A loyal addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the king by the city of London; and the merchants of this metropolis re&s;olved to rai&s;e two regiments at their own expence. Orders were i&s;&s;ued to keep the trained bands in readine&s;s; to array the militia of We&s;t|min&s;ter; and in&s;tructions to the &s;ame effect were &s;ent to all the lords$lieutenants of the counties throughout the kingdom. The principal noblemen of the nation made a tender of their &s;ervices to their &s;overeign; and &s;ome of them re|ceived commi&s;&s;ions to levy regiments towards the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebellion. Bodies of volunteers were incorporated in London, and many other places; a&s;&s;ociations formed, large contributions rai&s;ed in different towns, counties, and communities; and a great number of eminent merchants in London agreed to &s;upport the public credit, by receiving, as u&s;ual, bank$notes in payment, for the purpo&s;es of traffic. The prote&s;tant clergy of all denominations exerted them&s;elves with extraordinary ardour, in preaching again&s;t the religion of Rome and the pretender; and the friends of the government were encouraged, ani|mated, and con$irmed in their principles, by &s;everal &s;pirited productions publi&s;hed for the occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>In a word, the whole nation &s;eemed unanimou&s;ly bent upon oppo&s;ing the enterprize of the pretender, who, neverthele&s;s, had already made &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s. His arrival in Scotland was no &s;ooner confirmed, than Sir John Cope$ who commanded the troops in that kingdom, a&s;&s;embled what force he could bring together, and advanced again&s;t the rebels. Under&s;tanding, however, that they had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong pa&s;s, he changed his route, and proceeded northwards as far as Inverne&s;s, leaving the capital and the &s;outhern parts of North-Britain wholly expo&s;ed to the incur&s;ions of the enemy. They forthwith marched to Perth, where the chevalier de St. George was pro|claimed king of Great-Britain, and the public money &s;eized for his u&s;e: the &s;ame &s;teps were taken at Dundee, and other places. Here prince Charles was joined by the nobleman who a&s;&s;umed the title of duke of Perth, the vi&s;|count Strathallan, lord Nairn, lord George Murray, and many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, with their followers. The marquis of Tullibardine, who had ac|companied him from France, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Athol, as heir of blood to the titles and e&s;tate which his younger brother enjoyed in con&s;equence of his at|tainder; and met with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s in arming the tenants for the &s;upport of that cau&s;e which he avowed. The rebel army being con&s;iderably augmented, though very ill provided with arms, cro&s;&s;ed the Forth in the neighbourhood of Stirling, and advanced towards Edinburgh, which they entered without oppo|&s;ition. The inhabitants were divided by faction and di&s;tracted by fear: the place was not in a po&s;ture of defence, and the magi&s;trates would not expo&s;e the people to the uncertain i&s;&s;ue of an a&s;&s;ault. In September, the rebels were ad|mitted into the city; and their prince took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the royal palace of Holy|rood hou&s;e, in the &s;uburbs. Then he cau&s;ed his father to be proclaimed at the market-cro&s;s; and there al&s;o the manife&s;to was read, in which the chevalier de St. George declared his &s;on Charles regent of his dominions, promi&s;ed to di&s;&s;olve the union, and redre&s;s the grievances of Scotland. His being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital encouraged his followers, and added reputation to his arms: but he mi&s;&s;ed his aim of &s;eizing the trea&s;ure belonging to the two banks of that kingdom, which had been previou&s;ly conveyed into the ca&s;tle, a &s;trong

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Sir John Cope marched back from Inverne&s;s to Aberdeen, where he embarked with his troops, and on the &s;ix|teenth day of September landed at Dunbar, about twenty miles to the ea&s;tward of Edinburgh. Here he was joined by two regiments of dragoons, which had retired from the capital at the approach of the Highland army With this reinforcement, his troops amounted to three thou&s;and men, including &s;ome Highlanders well-affected to the government, who had offered their &s;ervices to him at Inverne&s;s; and he began his march for Edinburgh, in order to give battle to the enemy. On the twentieth day of the month, he encamped in the neighbourhood of Pre&s;ton-pans, having the village of Tranent in his front, and the &s;ea in his rear. Early next morning he was attacked by the young pre|tender, at the head of about three thou&s;and Highlanders half armed, who charged him &s;word in hand, with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that in le&s;s than ten minutes after the battle began, the king's troops were broken and totally routed. The dragoons fled with great precipitation at the fir&s;t on&s;et: the general officers having made &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts to rally them, thought proper to con|&s;ult their own &s;afety by an expeditious retreat towards Berwick. All the infantry was either killed or taken; and the colours, artillery, tents, bag|gage, and military che&s;t, fell into the hands of the victor, who returned in triumph to Edinburgh. Never was victory more complete, or obtained at a &s;maller expence; for not above four&s;core of the rebels lo&s;t their lives in the engagement. Five hundred of the king's troops were killed on the field of battle; and among the&s;e colonel Gardiner, a gallant officer, who di&s;dained to &s;ave his life at the expence of his honour. When abandoned by his own re|giment of dragoons, he alighted from his hor&s;e, joined the infantry, and fought on foot, until he fell covered with wounds, in &s;ight of his own thre&s;hold. Prince Charles bore his good fortune with moderation. The wounded &s;oldiers were treated with humanity; and the officers were &s;ent into Fife and Angus, where they were left at liberty on their parole, which the greater part of them &s;hame|fully broke in the &s;equel. From this victory the pretender reaped manifold and important advantages. His followers were armed, his party encouraged, and his enemies intimidated. He was &s;upplied with a train of field-artillery, and a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, and &s;aw him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all Scotland, except the fortre&s;&s;es, the reduction of which he could not pretend to undertake with|out proper implements and engineers. After the battle he was joined by a &s;mall detachment from the Highlands; and &s;ome chiefs, who had hitherto been on the re&s;erve, began to exert their influence in his favour. But he was not yet in a condition to take advantage of that con&s;ternation which his late &s;ucce&s;s had diffu&s;ed through the kingdom of England.</P>

<P>He continued to re&s;ide in the palace of Holy-rood hou&s;e; and made &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to cut off the communication between the ca&s;tle and the city. He levied a regiment in Edinburgh and the neighbour|hood. He impo&s;ed taxes; &s;eized the merchandi&s;e that was depo&s;ited in the king's warehou&s;es at Leith, and other places; compelled the city of Gla&s;gow to accommodate him with a large &s;um, and layed the country under contri|bution. The number of his followers daily increa&s;ed; and he received con|&s;iderable
<PB N="665" REF="6680">
&s;upplies of money, artillery, and ammunition, by &s;ingle &s;hips that arrived from France, where his intere&s;t &s;eemed to ri&s;e in proportion of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his arms. The greater and richer part of Scotland was aver&s;e to his family and preten&s;ions: but the people were unarmed and undi&s;ciplined, con&s;equently pa&s;&s;ive under his dominion. Several powerful chiefs in the Highlands were attached to the government, and exerted them&s;elves in its defence. The duke of Argyle began to arm his va&s;&s;als: twelve hundred men were rai&s;ed by the earl of Sutherland: the lord Rae brought a con&s;iderable number to the field: the Grants and Monroes appeared under their re&s;pective leaders for the &s;ervice of his maje&s;ty: Sir Alexander Macdonald and the laird of Macleod &s;ent two thou&s;and hardy I&s;landers from Skie, to &s;trengthen the &s;ame intere&s;t. The&s;e gentlemen were governed and directed by the advice of Dun|can Forbes, pre&s;ident of the college of ju&s;tice at Edinburgh, a man of ex|ten&s;ive knowledge, agreeable manners, and unblemi&s;hed integrity. He acted with indefatigable zeal for the intere&s;t of the reigning family; and even ex|hau&s;ted an opulent fortune in their &s;ervice. He confirmed &s;everal chiefs who began to waver in their principles: &s;ome he actually converted by the energy of his arguments, and brought over to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the government, which they had determined to oppo&s;e: others he per&s;uaded to remain quiet, without taking any &s;hare in the pre&s;ent troubles. The earl of Loudon re|paired to Inverne&s;s, where he completed his regiment of Highlanders; directed the conduct of the clans who had taken arms in behalf of his maje&s;ty; and, by his vigilance, overawed the di&s;affected chieftains of that country who had not yet openly engaged in the rebellion. By this time, however, the prince-pretender was joined by the earl of Kilmarnock, the lords Elcho, Balmerino, Ogilvy, Pit&s;ligo; and the elde&s;t &s;on of lord Lovat had begun to a&s;&s;emble his father's clan, in order to reinforce the victorious adventurer, who&s;e army lay encamped by Dalkeith, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. Kilmarnock, Pit&s;ligo, and Balmerino, were men of broken and de&s;perate fortune: Elcho and Ogilvie were &s;ons to the earls of Wemys and Airly; &s;o that their influence was far from being exten&s;ive. But great dependance was placed upon the power and attachment of lord Lovat, who had entered into private engage|ments with the chevalier de St. George; though he &s;till wore the ma&s;k of loyalty to the government, and di&s;avowed the conduct of his &s;on when he de|clared for the pretender. This old nobleman is the &s;ame Simon Frazer whom we have had occa&s;ion to mention as a parti&s;an and emi&s;&s;ary of the court of St. Germains, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eight. He had re|nounced his connections with that family; and, in the rebellion immediately after the acce&s;&s;ion of king George I. approved him&s;elf a warm friend to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Since that period he had been induced, either by di&s;gu&s;t or ambition, to change his principles again, and was in &s;ecret an enthu&s;ia&s;t in jacobiti&s;m. He had greatly augmented his e&s;tate, and obtained a con&s;iderable intere&s;t in the Highlands, where, however, he was rather dreaded than be|loved. He was bold, enterpri&s;ing, vain, arbitrary, rapacious, cruel, and de|ceitful: but his character was chiefly marked by a &s;pecies of low cunning and di&s;&s;imulation, which, however, over&s;hot his purpo&s;e, and contributed to his own ruin.</P>

<P>While the young pretender endeavoured to improve the advan|tages he had gained, the mini&s;try of Great-Britain took every po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ure to retard his progre&s;s. Immediately after the defeat of Cope, &s;ix thou&s;and Dutch troops arrived in England, and three battalions of guards, with &s;even regiments of infantry, were recalled from Flanders for the defence of the king|dom. They forthwith began their march to the North, under the command of general Wade, who received orders to a&s;&s;emble an army, which proceeded to Newca&s;tle. The parliament meeting on the &s;ixteenth day of October, his ma|je&s;ty gave them to under&s;tand, that an unnatural rebellion had broke out in Scotland, towards the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of which he craved their advice and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. He found both hou&s;es cordial in their addre&s;&s;es, and zealous in their attachment to his per&s;on and government. The commons forthwith &s;u&s;pended the habeas corpus act, and &s;everal per&s;ons were apprehended on &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable practices. Immediately after the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened, the duke of Cumberland arrived from the Netherlands, and was followed by another de|tachment of dragoons and infantry. The trained-bands of London were re|viewed by his maje&s;ty: the county regiments were completed: the volunteers in different parts of the kingdom employed them&s;elves indu&s;triou&s;ly in the ex|erci&s;e of arms; and the whole Engli&s;h nation &s;eemed to ri&s;e up as one man again&s;t this formidable invader. The government being apprehen&s;ive of a de&s;cent from France, appointed admiral Vernon to command a &s;quadron in the Downs, to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy by &s;ea, e&s;pecially in the har|bours of Dunkirk and Boulogne; and his cruizers took &s;everal &s;hips loaded with &s;oldiers, officers, and ammunition, de&s;tined for the &s;ervice of the pretender in Scotland.</P>

<P>This enterpri&s;ing youth having collected about five thou&s;and men, re&s;olved to make an irruption into England, which he accordingly entered by the we&s;t border on the &s;ixth day of November. Carlile was inve&s;ted, and in le&s;s than three days &s;urrendered: here he found a con&s;iderable quantity of arms, and was proclaimed king of Great-Britain. General Wade being ap|pri&s;ed of his progre&s;s, decamped from Newca&s;tle, and advanced acro&s;s the country as far as Hexham, though the fields were covered with &s;now, and the roads almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able. Here he received intelligence that Carlile was reduced, and forthwith returned to his former &s;tation. In the mean time, orders were i&s;&s;ued for a&s;&s;embling another army in Stafford&s;hire, under the command of Sir John Ligonier. Prince Charles, notwith&s;tanding this formidable oppo&s;ition, determined to proceed. He had received a&s;&s;urances from France, that a con&s;iderable body of troops would be landed on the &s;outhern coa&s;t of Britain, to make a diver&s;ion in his favour; and he never doubted but that he &s;hould be joined by all the Engli&s;h malcontents, as &s;oon as he could penetrate into the heart of the kingdom. Leaving a &s;mall garri&s;on in the ca&s;tle of Carlile, he advanced to Penrith, marching on foot in the Highland garb, at the head of his forces; and continued his route through Lanca&s;ter and Pre&s;ton to Manche&s;ter, where, on the twenty-ninth day of the month, he e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters. Here he was joined by about two hundred Engli&s;hmen, who were formed into a regiment, under the com|mand of colonel Townley. The inhabitants &s;eemed to receive him with marks of affection; and his arrival was celebrated by illuminations and other public
<PB N="667" REF="6700">
rejoicings. His intention was to pro&s;ecute his march by the way of Che&s;ter into Wales, where he hoped to find a great number of adherents; but all the bridges over the river Mer&s;ey being broke down, he cho&s;e the route to Stock|port, and forded the river at the head of his divi&s;ion, though the water ro&s;e to his middle. He pa&s;&s;ed through Macclesfield and Congleton; and, on the fourth day of December entered the town of Derby, in which his army was quartered, and him&s;elf proclaimed with great formality. He had now advanced within one hundred miles of the capital, which was filled with terror and confu&s;ion. Wade lingered in York&s;hire: the duke of Cumberland had a&s;|&s;umed the command of the other army a&s;&s;embled in the neighbourhood of Litchfield. He had marched from Stafford to Stone; &s;o that the rebels, in turning off by A&s;hborne to Derby, had gained a march between him and London. Had this adventurer proceeded in his career with that expedition which he had hitherto u&s;ed, he might have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the metropolis, where he would have been certainly joined by a con&s;iderable number of his well-wi&s;hers, who waited impatiently for his approach: yet this exploit could not have been atchieved without hazarding an engagement. Orders were given for forming a camp on Finchley-common, where the king re&s;olved to take the field in per&s;on, accompanied by the earl of Stair, field-marechal and commander in chief of the forces in South-Britain. Some romi&s;h prie&s;ts were apprehended: the militia of London and Middle&s;ex were kept in readine&s;s to march: double watches were po&s;ted at the city-gates, and &s;ignals of alarm appointed. The volunteers of the city were incorporated into a regiment: the practitioners of the law, headed by the judges: the weavers of Spittlefields, and other com|munities, engaged in a&s;&s;ociations; and even the managers of the theatres of|fered to rai&s;e a body of their dependants for the &s;ervice of the government. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions and appearances of unanimity, the trading part of the city, and tho&s;e concerned in the money-corporations, were over|whelmed with fear and dejection. They repo&s;ed very little confidence in the courage or di&s;cipline of their militia and volunteers: they had received in|telligence that the French were employed in making preparations at Dunkirk and Calais for a de&s;cent upon England: they dreaded an in&s;urrection of the roman catholics, and other friends of the hou&s;e of Stuart; and they reflected that the Highlanders, of whom by this time they had conceived a mo&s;t terrible idea, were within four days march of the capital. Alarmed by the&s;e con|&s;iderations, they progno&s;ticated their own ruin in the approaching revolution; and their countenances exhibited the plaine&s;t marks of horror and de&s;pair. On the other hand, the jacobites were elevated to an in&s;olence of hope, which they were at no pains to conceal; while many people who had no private property to lo&s;e, and thought no change would be for the wor&s;e, waited the i&s;&s;ue of this cri&s;is with the mo&s;t calm indifference.</P>

<P>This &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence was of &s;hort duration. The young pre|tender found him&s;elf mi&s;erably di&s;appointed in his expectations. He had now advanced into the middle of the kingdom, and, except a few that joined him at Manche&s;ter, not a &s;oul appeared in his behalf: one would have imagined that all the jacobites of England had been annihilated. The Wel&s;h took no &s;tep towards an in&s;urrection in his favour: the French made no attempt to|wards an inva&s;ion: his court was divided into factions: the Highland chiefs

began to murmur, and their clans to be unruly: he &s;aw him&s;elf with a hand|ful of men hemmed in between two con&s;iderable armies, in the middle of win|ter, and in a country $$affected to his cau&s;e. He knew he could not pro|ceed to the metropolis without hazarding a battle, and that a defeat would be attended with the $$evitable de&s;truction of him&s;elf and all his adherents. He called a council at Derby; and, after violent di&s;putes, the majority deter|mined, that they &s;hould retreat to Scotland with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. Ac|cordingly they abandoned Derby on the &s;ixth day of December, early in the morning, and marched with &s;uch cel$rity, that on the ninth their van guard arrived at Manche&s;ter; on the twelfth they entered Pre&s;ton, and continued their route northwards. The duke of Cumberland, who was encamped at Meriden, when fir&s;t appri&s;ed of their retreat, detached the hor&s;e and dragoons in pur&s;uit of them; while general Wade began his march from Ferrybridge into Lanca&s;hire, with a view of intercepting them in their route: but at Wake|field he under&s;tood that they had already reached Wigan; and therefore he repaired to his old po&s;t at Newca&s;tle, after having detached general Oglethorpe with his hor&s;e and dragoons, to join tho&s;e who had been &s;ent off from the duke's army. They pur&s;ued with &s;uch alacrity, that they overtook the rear of the rebels, with which they &s;kirmi&s;hed in Lanca&s;hire. The militia of Cum|berland and We&s;tmoreland were rai&s;ed and armed by the duke's order, to harra&s;s them in their march. The bridges were broken down, the roads da|maged, and the beacons lighted to alarm the country. Neverthele&s;s, they retreated regularly with their &s;mall train of artillery. They were overtaken at the village of Clifton, in the neighbourhood of Penrith, by two regiments of dragoons. The&s;e alighted in order to attack a party of their rear-guard which had thrown them&s;elves into the place with a view to retard the pur&s;uit. The a&s;&s;ailants were roughly handled; and the rebels having accompli&s;hed their purpo&s;e, retired with the lo&s;s of a few individuals, who were either killed or taken. On the nineteenth day of the month, the Highland army reached Carlile, and having reinforced the garri&s;on of the place, cro&s;&s;ed the rivers Eden and Solway into Scotland: having thus accompli&s;hed one of the mo&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;ing retreats that ever was performed; but the mo&s;t remarkable circum|&s;tance of this expedition, was the moderation and regularity with which tho&s;e ferocious people conducted them&s;elves in a country abounding with plunder. No violence was offered, no outrage committed; and they were effectually re|&s;trained from the exerci&s;e of rapine. Notwith&s;tanding the exce&s;&s;ive cold, the hunger and fatigue to which they mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed, they left behind no &s;ick, nor &s;tragglers; but, retired with deliberation, and carried off their can|non in the face of their enemy. The duke of Cumberland inve&s;ted Carlile with his whole army on the twenty-fir&s;t day of December, and on the thirtieth, the garri&s;on &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. The pri&s;oners amounting to about four hundred, were impri&s;oned in different gaols in England, and the duke returned to London.</P>

<P>The pretender proceeded by the way of Dumfries to Gla&s;gow, from which la&s;t city he exacted &s;evere contributions, on account of its attach|ment to the government, for who&s;e &s;ervice it had rai&s;ed a regiment of nine hundred men, under the command of the earl of Hume. Having continued &s;everal days at Gla&s;gow, he advanced towards Stirling, and was joined by &s;ome

forces which had been a&s;&s;embled in his ab&s;ence by lord Lewis Gordon, and John Drummond, brothers to the dukes of Gordon and Perth. This la&s;t nobleman had arrived from France in November, with a &s;mall reinforcement of French and Iri&s;h, and a commi&s;&s;ion as general of the&s;e auxiliaries. He fixed his head-quarters at Perth, where he was reinforced by the earl of Cromartie, and other clans, to the number of two thou&s;and, and he was accommodated with a &s;mall train of artillery. They had found means to &s;urpri&s;e a &s;loop of war at Montro&s;e, with the guns of which they fortified that harbour. They had received a con&s;iderable &s;um of money from Spain. They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dundee, Dumblaine, Down-ca&s;tle$ and layed Fife under contribution. The earl of London remained at Inverne&s;s, with about two thou&s;and Highlanders in the &s;ervice of his maje&s;ty. He rai&s;ed the blockade of Fort-Augu&s;tus, which the &s;on of lord Lovat had formed: he &s;ecured the per&s;on of that nobleman, who &s;till temporized, and at length accompli&s;hed his e&s;cape. The laird of Macleod, and Mr. Monro of Culcairn, being detached from Inverne&s;s towards Aberdeen&s;hire, were &s;urpri&s;ed and routed by lord Lewis Gordon at Inverury; and that intere&s;t &s;eemed to preponderate in the north of Scotland. Prince Charles being joined by lord John Drummond, inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Stirling, in which general Blakeney commanded: but, his people were &s;o little u&s;ed to enterprizes of this kind, that they made very little progre&s;s in their operations.</P>

<P>By this time, a con&s;iderable body of forces was a&s;&s;embled at Edinburgh, under the conduct of general Hawley, who re&s;olved to relieve Stir|ling-ca&s;tle, and advanced to Linlithgow on the thirteenth day of January: next day his whole army rendezvou&s;ed at Falkirk, while the rebels lay en|camped at Torwood. On the &s;eventeenth day of the month, they were per|ceived in full march to attack the king's forces, which were formed in order of battle, and advanced to the encounter. The enemy had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hill on their right; and Hawley ordered two regiments of dragoons to drive them from that eminence. Their prince, who &s;tood in the front of the line, gave the &s;ignal to fire, by waving his cap; and his followers took aim &s;o well, that the a&s;&s;ailants were broke by the fir&s;t volley: they retreated with precipita|tion, and fell in among&s;t the infantry, which were likewi&s;e di&s;compo&s;ed by the wind and rain beating with great violence in their faces, wetting their powder, and di&s;turbing their eye-&s;ight. The rebels followed their fir&s;t blow, and great part of the royal army, after one irregular di&s;charge, turned their backs and fled in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. In all probability few or none of them would have e&s;caped, had not general Hu&s;ke, and brigadier Cholmondely rallied &s;ome regiments, and made a gallant &s;tand, which favoured the retreat of the re&s;t to Falkirk. Among the few that with&s;tood the general pannic on this occa&s;ion, was the Gla&s;gow regiment of militia, which had been appointed to guard the baggage, and maintained its ground until it was ordered to retreat. The king's forces retired in confu&s;ion to Edinburgh, leaving the field of battle, with part of their tents and artillery, to the rebels: but, their lo&s;s of men did not exceed three hundred, including Sir Robert Monro, colonel Whitney, and &s;ome other officers of di&s;tinction. It was at this period, that the officers who had been taken at Pre&s;tonpans, and conveyed to Angus and Fife, finding them&s;elves unguarded, broke their parole, and returned to Edinburgh, on pretence of their having been forcibly relea&s;ed by the inhabitants of tho&s;e parts.</P>

<P>General Hawley, who had b$a&s;ted that, with two regiments of dragoons, he would drive the rebel army from one end of the kingdom to the other, incurred abundance of cen&s;ure for the $word$ he made, as well as for his conduct before and after the action; but he found means to vindicate him|&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of his &s;overeign. Neverthele&s;s it was judged nece&s;&s;ary that the army in Scotland &s;hould be commanded by a general in whom the &s;oldiers might have &s;ome confidence; and the du$e of Cumberland was cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e. Over and above his being beloved by the army, it was &s;ug|ge&s;ted, that the appearance of a prince of the blood, in Scotland, might have a favourable effe$t upon the minds of people in that kingdom: he therefore began to prepare for his northern expedition. Mean wh$$e, the French mini|&s;ter at the Hague, having repre&s;ented to the &s;tates-general$ that the auxiliaries which they had &s;ent into Great-Britain, were part of the garri&s;on of Tournay, and re&s;tricted by the capitulation from bearing arms again$t France for a certain term; they thought proper to recal them, rather than come to an open rup|ture with his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty; and in their room &s;ix thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians were tran&s;ported from Flanders to Leith, where they arrived in the beginning of February, under the command of their prince Frederi$k of He&s;&s;e, &s;on-in-law to his Britannic maje&s;ty. By this time, the duke of Cumberland had put him&s;elf at the head of the troops at Edinburgh, con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen batta|lions of infantry, two regiments of dragoons, and fifteen hundred Highlanders from Argyle&s;hire, under the command of colonel Campbell. On the la&s;t day of January, his royal highne&s;s began his march to Linlithgow; and the enemy, who had renewed the &s;iege of Stirling-ca&s;tle, not only abandoned that enter|prize, but cro&s;&s;ed the river Forth with precipitation. Their prince found great difficulty in maintaining his forces, that part of the country being quite ex|hau&s;ted; he hoped to be reinforced in the Highlands, and to receive &s;upplies of all kinds from France and Spain: he, therefore, retired by Bad$noch towards Inverne&s;s, which the earl of Loudon abandoned at his approach. The fort was &s;urrendered to him without oppo&s;ition, and here he fixed his head-quarters. The duke of Cumberland having &s;ecured the important po&s;ts of Stirling and Perth, with the He&s;&s;ian battalions, advanced with the army to Aberdeen, where he was joined by the duke of Gordon, the earls of Aberdeen and Findlater, the laird of Grant, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction.</P>

<P>While he remained in this place, refre&s;hing his troops and pre|paring magazines, a party of the rebels &s;urpri&s;ed a detachment of King&s;ton's hor&s;e, and about &s;eventy Argyie&s;hire h$ghlanders, at Keith, who were cut in pieces. Several advanced parties of that militia m$t with the &s;ame fate in different places. Lord George Murray inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Blair, which was defended by Sir Andrew Agnew, until a body of He&s;&s;ians marched to its relief, and obliged the rebels to retire. They likewi&s;e undertook the &s;iege of Fort-William, under the direction of brigadier Stapleton, an engineer in the $rench &s;ervice: but, the place was &s;o vigorou&s;ly maintained by captain Scot, that in the beginning of April they thought proper to relinqui&s;h the enter|prize. The earl of London had retired into Sutherland, and taken po&s;t at Dornoch, where his quarters were beat up by a &s;trong detachment of the rebels command$d by the duke of Perth: a major and &s;ixty men were taken pri&s;one$s, and the earl was obliged to take &s;helter in the i&s;le of Skye. The&s;e little checks
<PB N="671" REF="6740">
were counter-balanced by &s;ome advantages which his maje&s;ty's arms obtained. The &s;loop of war which the rebels had &s;urpri&s;ed at Montro&s;e, was re-taken in Sutherland, with a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, and a great quantity of arms on board, which &s;he had brought from France for the u&s;e of the pretender. In the &s;ame county, the earl of Cromarty fell into an ambu&s;cade, and was taken by the militia of Sutherland, who likewi&s;e defeated a body of the rebels at Gold&s;pie. This action happened on the very day which has been rendered famous by the victory obtained at Culloden.</P>

<P>IN the beginning of April, the duke of Cumberland began his march from Aberdeen; and on the twel&s;th, pa&s;&s;ed the de$p and rapid river Spey, without oppo&s;ition from the rebels, though a con&s;iderable number of them appeared on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. Why they did not di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age, is not ea&s;y to be conceived: but, indeed, from this in&s;t$n$e of neglect, and their &s;ub&s;equent conduct, we may conclude, they were under a total infatuation. His royal highne&s;s proceeded to Nairn, where he received intelligence, that the enemy had advanced from Inverne&s;s to Culloden, about the di&s;tance of nine miles from the royal army$ with intention to give him battle. On the &s;ixteenth day of April, the duke having made the proper di&s;po&s;itions, decamped from N$$rn early in the morning$ and after a march of nine miles, perceived the Highlanders drawn up in order of battle, to the numb$r of eight thou&s;and men, in thirteen divi&s;ions, &s;upp$$ed with &s;ome pieces of artillery. The royal army, which were much more numerous, the duke immediat$ly formed into three
<PB N="673" REF="6760">
lines, di&s;po&s;ed in excellent order; and about one o'clock in the afternoon, the canonading began. The artillery of the rebels was ill &s;erved, and did very little execution; but that of the king's troops made dreadful havock among the enemy. Impatient of this fire, their front-line advanced to the attack, and about five hundred of the clans charged the duke's left wing with their u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity. One regiment was di&s;ordered by the weight of this column: but two battalions advancing from the &s;econd line, &s;u&s;tained the fir&s;t, and &s;oon put a &s;top to their career, by a &s;evere fire, that killed a great number. At the &s;ame time, the dragoons under Hawley, and the Argyle&s;hire militia, pulled down a park-wall that covered their right flank, and falling in among them &s;word in hand, completed their confu&s;ion. The French piquets on their left, did not fire a &s;hot; but, &s;tood inactive during the engagement, and after|wards &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. An intire body of the clans marched off the field in order, with their pipes playing: the re&s;t were routed with great &s;laughter, and their prince was with reluctance prevailed upon to retire. In le&s;s than thirty minutes, they were totally defeated, and the field covered with their dead bodies. The road, as far as Inverne&s;s, was &s;trewed with dead bodies; and a great number of people, who, from motives of curio&s;ity, had come to &s;ee the battle, were &s;acrificed to the undi&s;tingui&s;hing vengeance of the victors. Three thou&s;and rebels were &s;lain on the field, and in the pur&s;uit. The earl of Kilmarnock was taken; and in a few days lord Balmerino &s;urren|dered him&s;elf to one of the detached parties. The glory of the victory was &s;ullied by the barbarity of the &s;oldiers. They had been provoked by their for|mer di&s;graces to the mo&s;t &s;avage thir&s;t of revenge: not contented with the blood which was &s;o profu&s;ely &s;hed in the heat of action, they traver&s;ed the field after the battle, and ma&s;&s;acred tho&s;e mi&s;erable wretches who lay maimed and expiring: nay, &s;ome officers acted a part in this cruel &s;cene of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion: the triumph of low illiberal minds, unin&s;pired by &s;entiment, untinc|tured by humanity. The vanqui&s;hed adventurer forded the river Ne&s;s, and retired with a few hor&s;e to Aird, where he conferred with old lord Lovat: then he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his followers, and wandered about a wretched and &s;olitary fugitive among the i&s;les and mountains, for the &s;pace of four months, during which he underwent &s;uch a &s;eries of dangers, hard&s;hips and mi&s;ery, as no other per&s;on ever outlived. Thus, in one &s;hort hour, all his hope vani&s;hed, and the rebellion was intirely extingui&s;hed. One would almo&s;t imagine, the conductors of this de&s;perate enterprize had con&s;pired their own de&s;truction, as they certainly neglected every &s;tep that might have contributed to their &s;afety or &s;ucce$s. They might have oppo&s;ed the duke of Cumberland at the pa&s;&s;age of the Spey: they might have afterwards attacked his camp in the night, with a good pro|&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. As they were greatly inferior to him in number, and weakened with hunger and fatigue, they might have retired to the hills and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, where they would have found plenty of live cattle for provi&s;ion, recruited their regiments, and been joined by a &s;trong reinforcement, which was actually in full march to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But they were di&s;tracted by di&s;&s;en&s;ions and jea|lou&s;ies; obeyed the dictates of de&s;pair, and wilfully devoted them&s;elves to ruin and death. When the news of the battle arrived in England, the whole nation was tran&s;ported with joy, and extolled the duke of Cumberland as a hero and deliverer. Both hou&s;es of parliament congratulated his maje&s;ty on this au&s;pi|cious
<PB N="674" REF="6770">
event. They decreed, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, their public thanks to his royal highne&s;s, which were tran&s;mitted to him by the &s;peakers; and the commons, by bill, added five and twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum to his former revenue.</P>

<P>Immediately after the deci&s;ive action at Culloden, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Inverne&s;s; and ordered &s;ix and thirty de&s;erters to be executed: then he de|tached &s;everal parties to ravage the country. One of the&s;e apprehended the lady Mackinto&s;h, who was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, plundered her hou&s;e, and drove away her cattle, though her hu&s;band was actually in the &s;ervice of the government. The ca&s;tle of lord Lovat was de&s;troyed. The French pri&s;oners were &s;ent to Carli&s;le and Penrith: Kilmarnock, Balmerino, Cromarty, and his &s;on the lord Macleod, were conveyed by &s;ea to London; and tho&s;e of an inferior rank were confined in different pri&s;ons. The marquis of Tullibardine, together with a brother of the earl of Dunmore, and Murray the pretender's &s;ecretary, were &s;eized and tran&s;ported to the Tower of London, to which the earl of Traquair had been committed on &s;u&s;picion; and the elde&s;t &s;on of lord Lovat was impri&s;oned in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh. In a word, all the gaols of Great-Britain, from the capital northwards, were filled with tho&s;e unfortunate captives; and great numbers of them were crowded together in the holds of &s;hips, where they peri&s;hed in the mo&s;t deplorable manner, for want of air and exerci&s;e. Some rebel chiefs e&s;caped in two French frigates that arrived on the coa&s;t of Lochaber about the end of April, and engaged three ve&s;&s;els belonging to his Britannic maje&s;ty, which they obliged to retire. Others embarked on board of a &s;hip on the coa&s;t of Buchan; and were conveyed to Norway, from whence they travelled to Sweden. In the month of May, the duke of Cumberland advanced with the army into the Highlands, as far as Fort Augu&s;tus, where he encamped; and &s;ent off detachments on all hands, to hunt down the fugitives, and lay wa&s;te the country with fire and &s;word. The ca&s;tles of Glengary and Lochiel were plundered and burned: every hou&s;e, hutt, or habitation, met with the &s;ame fate, without di&s;tinction; all the cattle and pro|vi&s;ion were carried off; the men were either &s;hot upon the mountains, like wild bea&s;ts, or put to death in cold blood, without form of trial; the women, after having &s;een their hu&s;bands and fathers murdered, were &s;ubjected to brutal violation, and then turned out naked, with their children, to &s;tarve on the barren heaths. One whole family was inclo&s;ed in a barn, and con&s;umed to a&s;hes. Tho&s;e mini&s;ters of vengeance were &s;o alert in the execution of the r office, that in a few days there was neither hou&s;e, cottage, man, nor bea&s;t, to be &s;een in the compa&s;s of fifty miles; all was ruin, &s;ilence and de&s;olation.</P>

<P>The humane reader cannot reflect upon &s;uch a &s;cene without grief and horror; what then mu&s;t have been the &s;en&s;ation of the fugitive prince, when he beheld the&s;e &s;pectacles of woe, the di&s;mal fruit of his ambition? He was now &s;urrounded by armed troops, that chaced him from hill to dale, from rock to cavern, and from &s;hore to &s;hore. Sometimes he lurked in caves and cottages, without attendants, or any other &s;upport but that which the poore&s;t pea&s;ant could &s;upply. Sometimes he was rowed in fi&s;her-boats from i&s;le to i&s;le, among the Hebrides, and often in &s;ight of his pur&s;uers. For &s;ome days he appeared in woman's attire, and even pa&s;&s;ed through the mid&s;t of his enemies, unknown. But, under&s;tanding that his di&s;gui&s;e was di&s;covered, he a&s;&s;umed
<PB N="675" REF="6780">
the habit of a travelling mountaineer, and wandered about among the woods and heaths, with a matted beard and &s;qualid looks, in continual danger of being apprehended, and expo&s;ed to cold, hunger, thir&s;t, and wearine&s;s. He was obliged to tru&s;t his life to the fidelity of above fifty individuals, and many of the&s;e were in the lowe&s;t paths of fortune. They knew that a price of thirty thou&s;and pounds was &s;et upon his head; and that by betraying him, they &s;hould enjoy wealth and affluence: but, they dete&s;ted the thought of obtaining riches on &s;uch infamous terms, and mini&s;tred to his nece&s;&s;ities, with the ut|mo&s;t zeal and fidelity, even at the hazard of their own de&s;truction. In the cour&s;e of the&s;e peregrinations, he was more than once hemmed in by his pur|&s;uers, in &s;uch a manner as &s;eemed to preclude all po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping; yet, he was never abandoned by his hope and recollection: he &s;till found &s;ome ex|pedient that &s;aved him from captivity and death; and through the wholecour&s;e of his di&s;tre&s;&s;es maintained the mo&s;t amazing equanimity and good humour. At length a privateer of St. Malo, hired by his adherents, arrived in Loch|nanach; and on the &s;eventeenth day of September, this unfortunate prince embarked in the mo&s;t wretched attire. He was clad in a &s;hort coat of black frize thread-bare, over which was a common highland plaid girt round him by a belt, from whence depended a pi&s;tol and a dagger. He had not been &s;hifted for many weeks: his &s;hoes and &s;tockings hung in tatters on his feet and legs. His eye was hollow, his vi&s;age wan, and his con&s;titution greatly im|paired by famine and fatigue. He was accompanied by Sullivan and Sheridan, two Iri&s;h adherents, who had &s;hared all his calamities, by Cameron of Lochiel and his brother, and a few other exiles. They &s;et &s;ail for France, and after having been chaced by two Engli&s;h &s;hips of war, arrived in &s;afety at Ro&s;cau near Morlaix in Bretagne. Perhaps, he would have found it &s;till more diffi|cult to e&s;cape, had not the vigilance and eagerne&s;s of the government been relaxed, in con&s;equence of a report, that he had already fallen among &s;ome per&s;ons that were &s;lain by a volley from one of the duke's detachments.</P>

<P>Having thus explained the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and extinction of the rebel|lion, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a retro&s;pective view of the proceedings in par|liament. The nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps being taken for quieting the inte&s;tine commotions of the kingdom, the two hou&s;es began to convert their attention to the affairs of the continent. On the fourteenth day of January, the king repaired to the hou&s;e of peers, and in a &s;peech from the throne gave his parliament to under&s;tand, that the &s;tates-general had made pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances for his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in the pre&s;ent conjuncture, when they were in &s;uch danger of being op|pre&s;&s;ed by the power of France in the Netherlands; that he had promi&s;ed to co-operate with them towards oppo&s;ing the further progre&s;s of their ene|mies; and even concerted mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e. He declared it was with regret that he a&s;ked any further aids of his people: he exhorted them to watch over the public credit; and expre&s;&s;ed his intire dependance in their zeal and unanimity. He was favoured with loyal addre&s;&s;es, couched in the warme&s;t terms of duty and affection: but the &s;upplies were retarded by new convul&s;ions in the mini&s;try. The earl of G. had made an effort to retrieve his influence in the cabinet, and his &s;overeign favoured his preten&s;ions. The two brothers, who knew his a&s;piring genius, and dreaded his &s;uperior talents, refu&s;ed to admit &s;uch a colleague into the admini&s;tration: they even re&s;olved to
<PB N="676" REF="6790">
&s;trengthen their party, by introducing fre&s;h auxiliaries into the offices of &s;tate. Some of the&s;e were per&s;onally di&s;agreeable to his maje&s;ty, who accordingly re|jected the &s;uit by which they were recommended. The duke of Newca&s;tle and his brother, with all their adherents, immediately re&s;igned their employments. The earl of Granville was appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and re&s;umed the reins of admini&s;tration; but finding him&s;elf unequal to the accumulated oppo&s;ition that preponderated again&s;t him; fore&s;eeing that he &s;hould not be able to &s;ecure the &s;upplies in parliament, and dreading the con&s;equences of that confu&s;ion which his re&s;toration had already produced, he, in three days, voluntarily quitted the helm; and his maje&s;ty acquie&s;ced in the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed by the oppo&s;ite party. The &s;eals were re-delivered to the duke of Newca&s;tle and the earl of Harrington: Mr. Pelham, and all the re&s;t who had re&s;igned, were re|in&s;tanted in their re&s;pective employments; and offices were conferred on &s;everal individuals who had never before been in the &s;ervice of the government. Wil|liam Pitt, E&s;q; was appointed vice-trea&s;urer of Ireland, and &s;oon promoted to the place of payma&s;ter-general of the forces; at the &s;ame time the king de|clared him a privy-coun&s;ellor. This gentleman had been originally de&s;igned for the army, in which he actually bore a commi&s;&s;ion; but fare re&s;erved him for a more important &s;tation. In point of fortune he was barely qualified to be elected member of parliament, when he obtained a &s;eat in the hou&s;e of com|mons, where he &s;oon out&s;hone all his compatriots. He di&s;played a &s;urpri&s;ing extent and preci&s;ion of political knowledge, an irre&s;i&s;table energy of argument, and &s;uch power of elocution, as &s;truck his hearers with a&s;toni&s;hment and ad|miration. It fla&s;hed like the lightning of heaven again&s;t the mini&s;ters and &s;ons of corruption, bla&s;ting where it &s;mote, and withering the nerves of oppo&s;ition: but his more &s;ub&s;tantial prai&s;e was founded upon his di&s;itere&s;ted integrity, his incorruptible heart, his unconquerable &s;pirit of independance, and his invari|able attachment to the intere&s;t and liberty of his country.</P>

<P>The quiet of the mini&s;try being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, the hou&s;e of commons provided for forty thou&s;and &s;eamen, nearly the &s;ame number of land-forces, be&s;ides fifteen regiments rai&s;ed by the nobility, on account of the rebellion, and about twelve thou&s;and marines. They &s;ettled funds for the maintenance of the Dutch and He&s;&s;ian troops that were in England, as well as for the &s;ub&s;idy to the landgrave. They granted three hundred thou&s;and pounds to the king of Sardinia; four hundred thou&s;and pounds to the queen of Hungary; three hundred and ten thou&s;and pounds to defray the expence of eighteen thou&s;and Hanoverians; about three and thirty thou&s;and pounds in &s;ub&s;idies to the electors of Mentz and Cologne; and five hundred thou&s;and pounds in a vote of credit and confidence to his maje&s;ty. The whole charge of the current year amounted to &s;even millions two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds, which was rai&s;ed by the land and malt-taxes, annuities on the additional duties impo&s;ed on gla&s;s, and &s;pirituous liquors, a lottery, a deduction from the &s;inking fund, and exchequer bills, chargeable on the fir&s;t aids that &s;hould be granted in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament.</P>

<P>The rebellion being quelled, the legi&s;lature re&s;olved to make examples of tho&s;e who had been concerned in di&s;turbing the peace of their country. In June an act of attainder was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the principal per&s;ons who had em|barked in that de&s;perate undertaking; and courts were opened in different parts
<PB N="677" REF="6800">
of England, for the trial of the pri&s;oners. Seventeen officers of the rebel army were executed at Kennington-common, in the neighbourhood of London, and &s;uffered with great con&s;tancy under the dreadful tortures which their &s;en|tence pre&s;cribed: nine were put to death, in the &s;ame manner, at Carli&s;le; &s;ix at Brumpton, &s;even at Penrith, and eleven at York: a few obtained pardons, and a con&s;iderable number were tran&s;ported to the plantations. Bills of in|dictment for high-trea&s;on were found by the county of Surry again&s;t the earls of Kilmarnock and Cromartie, and the lord Balmerino. The&s;e noble|men were tried by their peers in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, the lord chancellor pre&s;iding as lord high-&s;teward for the occa&s;ion. The two earls confe&s;&s;ed their crime, and in pathetic &s;peeches recommended them&s;elves to his maje&s;ty's mercy. Lord Balmerino pleaded not guilty: he denied his having been at Carli&s;le at the time &s;pecified in the indictment; but this exception was over-ruled: then he moved a point of law in arre&s;t of judgment, and was allowed to be heard by his coun&s;el. They might have expatiated on the hard&s;hip of being tried by an ex po&s;t facto law, and claimed the privilege of trial in the county where the act of trea&s;on was &s;aid to have been committed. The &s;ame hard&s;hip was impo&s;ed upon all the impri&s;oned rebels: they were dragged in captivity to a &s;trange country, far from their friends and connexions, de&s;titute of $word$ to produce evidence in their favour, even if they had been innocent of the charge. Balmerino waived this plea, and &s;ubmitted to the court, which pronounced &s;en|tence of death upon him and his two a&s;&s;ociates. Cromartie's life was &s;pared; but the other two were beheaded, in the month of Augu&s;t, on Tower-hill. Kilmar|nock was a nobleman of fine per&s;onal accompli&s;hments: he had been educated in revolution principles, and engaged in the rebellion, partly from the de&s;perate &s;ituation of his fortune, and partly from re&s;entment to the government, on his being deprived of a pen&s;ion which he had for &s;ome time enjoyed. He was convinced of his having acted criminally, and died with marks of penitence and contrition. Balmerino had been bred to arms, and acted upon principle: he was unpoli&s;hed in his manners, brave, rough, and re&s;olute, eyed the imple|ments of death with the mo&s;t carele&s;s familiarity, and &s;eemed to triumph in his &s;ufferings. In November, Mr. Ratcliff, the titular earl of Derwentwater, who had been taken in a &s;hip bound to Scotland, was arraigned on a former &s;en|tence, pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixteen: he refu&s;ed to acknowledge the authority of the court, and pleaded that he was a &s;ubject of France, honoured with a commi&s;&s;ion in the &s;ervice of his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty. The identity of his per&s;on being proved, a rule was made for his execution; and on the eighth day of December he &s;uffered decapita|tion, with the mo&s;t perfect compo&s;ure and &s;erenity. Lord Lovat, now turned of four&s;core, was impeached by the commons, and tried in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall before the lord high-&s;teward. John Murray, &s;ecretary to the prince-pretender, and &s;ome of his own dome&s;tics appearing again&s;t him, he was convicted of high|trea&s;on, and condemned. Notwith&s;tanding his age, infirmities, and the recol|lection of his con&s;cience, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be not altogether void of of|fence, he died like an old Roman, exclaiming, <Q>&startq;dulce et decorum pro patria m$$$.&endq;</Q> He &s;urveyed the crowd with attention, examined the axe, je&s;ted with the executioner, and layed his head upon the block with the utmo&s;t indiffe|rence. From this la&s;t &s;cene of his life one would have concluded, that he had

approved him&s;elf a patriot from his youth, and never deviated from the paths of virtue.</P>

<P>The flame of war on the continent did not expire at the election of an emperor, and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace among the princes of the empire. On the contrary, it rag$d with double v$$lence in con&s;equence of the&s;e events; for the force that was before divided being now united in one body, exerted it&s;elf with greater vigour and rapidity. The &s;tate$$general were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation. Notwith&s;tanding the pains they had taken to avoid a war, and the conde&s;o$n&s;ion with which they had &s;oothed and &s;upplicated the French mo|narch in repeated emba&s;&s;ies and memorials, they &s;aw them&s;elves &s;tripped of their barrier, and once more in danger of being overwhelmed by that ambitious nation. The city of Bru&s;&s;els had been reduced during the winter; &s;o that the enemy were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Au&s;trian Netherlands, except a few fortre&s;&s;es. Great part of the forces belonging to the republic were re&s;tricted from action by capitulations, to which they had &s;ub&s;cribed. The &s;tates were divided in their councils between the two factions which had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. They trembled at the pro&s;pect of &s;eeing Zealand invaded in the &s;pring. The Orange party loudly called for an augmentation of their forces by &s;ea and land, that they might pro|&s;ecute the war with vigour. The common people, fond of novelty, dazzled by the &s;plendor of greatne&s;s, and fully per&s;uaded, that nothing but a chief was wanting to their &s;ecurity, demanded the prince of Orange as a &s;tadtholder; and even mingled menaces with their demands. The oppo&s;ite faction dreaded alike the power of a &s;tadtholder, the neighbourhood of a French army, and the &s;editious di&s;po&s;ition of the populace. An amba&s;&s;ador was &s;ent to London with repre|&s;entations of the imminent dangers which threatened the republic; and he was ordered to &s;ollicit in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Britannic ma|je&s;ty, that the allies might have a &s;uperiority in the N$$herlands by the begin|ning of the campaign. The king was very well di&s;po&s;ed to comply with their reque&s;t; but the rebellion in his kingdom, and the di&s;&s;en&s;ions in his cabinet, had retarded the &s;upplies, and embarra&s;&s;ed him &s;o much, that he found it im|po&s;&s;ible to make tho&s;e early preparations that were ne$$&s;&s;ary to check the career of the enemy.</P>

<P>The king of France, with his general the count de S$xe, took the field in the latter end of April, at the head of one hundred and twenty thou&s;and men, and advanced towards the allies, who, to the number of four and forty thou&s;and, were intrenched behind the Demer, under the conduct of the Au&s;trian general Bathiani, who retired before them, and took po&s;t in the neighbourhood of Breda, the capital of Dutch Brabant. Marechal Saxe immediately inve&s;ted Antwerp, which in a few days was &s;urrendered. Then he appeared before the &s;trong town of Mons in Hainault, with an irre&s;i&s;tible train of artillery, an immen&s;e quantity of bombs and warlike implements, and carried on his ap|proaches with &s;uch unabating impetuo&s;ity, that notwith&s;tanding a very vigorous defence, the garri&s;on was obliged to capitulate on the twenty-&s;eventh day of June, in about eight and twenty days after the place had been inve&s;ted. Sieges were not now carried on by the tediou$ method of &s;apping. The French king found it much more expedi$$ous and effectual to bring into the field a prodi|gious train of battering cannon, and enormous mortars, that kept up &s;uch a fire as no garri&s;on could &s;u&s;tain, and di&s;charged &s;uch an ince&s;&s;ant hail of bombs
<PB N="679" REF="6820">
and bullets, as in a very little time reduced to ruins the place, with all its fortifi|cations. St. Gui&s;lain and Charleroy met with the fate of Mons and Antwerp; &s;o that by the middle of July the French king was ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of Flanders, Brabant, and Hainault.</P>

<P>Prince Charles of Lorraine had by this time a&s;&s;umed the command of the confederate army at Terheyde, which being reinforced by the He&s;&s;ian troops from Scotland, and a fre&s;h body of Au&s;trians under count Palfi, amounted to eighty-&s;even thou&s;and men, including the Dutch forces commanded by the prince of Waldeck. The generals, &s;uppo&s;ing the next &s;torm would fall upon Namur, marched towards that place, and took po&s;t in an advantageous &s;ituation on the eighteenth day of July, in &s;ight of the French army, which was encamped at Gemblours. Here they remained till the eighth day of Augu&s;t, when a detach|ment of the enemy, commanded by count Lowendahl, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Huy, where he found a large magazine belonging to the confederates; and their communication with Mae&s;tricht was cut off. Marechal Saxe, on the other &s;ide, took his mea&s;ures &s;o well, that they were utterly deprived of all &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Then prince Charles retiring acro&s;s the Maeze, abandoned Namur to the efforts of the enemy, by whom it was immediately inve&s;ted. The trenches were opened on the &s;econd day of September; and the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even thou&s;and Au&s;trians, defended them&s;elves with equal &s;kill and re&s;olution; but, the cannonading and bombardment were &s;o terrible, that in a few days the place was converted into a heap of rubbi&s;h; and on the twenty-third day of the month the French monarch took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this &s;trong fortre&s;s, which had formerly &s;u&s;tained &s;uch dreadful attacks. Mean while the allied army encamped at Mae&s;tricht, were joined by Sir John Ligonier, with &s;ome Briti&s;h and Bavarian battalions; and prince Charles re&s;olved to give the enemy battle. With this view he pa&s;&s;ed the Maeze on the thirteenth day of September, and advanced towards marechal Saxe, whom he found &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted at Tongres, that he thought proper to march back to Mae&s;tricht. On the twenty-&s;ixth day of September he cro&s;&s;ed the Jaar in his retreat; and his rear was attacked by the enemy, who were repul&s;ed. But, count Saxe being reinforced by a body of troops, under the count de Clermont, determined to bring the confederates to an engagement. On the thirteenth day of the month he pa&s;&s;ed the Jaar, while they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the villages of Liers, Warem, and Roucoux, drew up their forces in order of battle, and made preparations for giving him a warm reception. On the fir&s;t day of October the enemy advanced in three columns; and a terrible cannonading began about noon. At two o'clock prince Waldeck on the left was charged with great fury; and after an ob&s;tinate defence over|powered by numbers. The villages were attacked in columns, and as one brigade was repul&s;ed another &s;ucceeded; &s;o that the allies were obliged to abandon the&s;e po&s;ts, and retreat towards Mae&s;tricht, with the lo&s;s of five thou|&s;and men, and thirty pieces of artillery. The victory, however, co&s;t the French general a much greater number of lives; and was attended with no &s;olid ad|vantage. Sir John Ligonier, the earls of Crawford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This nobleman, &s;o remarkable for his courage and thir&s;t of glory, exhibited a very extraordinary in&s;tance of pr$&s;e$ce of mind on the morning that preceded this battle. He and &s;ome volunteers, accompanied by his aid-du-camp, and attended by two orderly dragoons, had rode out before day to reconnoitre the &s;ituation of the enemy; and fell in upon one of their advanced guards. The &s;erjeant who commanded it immediate$y turned ou$ his men, and their pieces w$re pre&s;ented when the earl fir$t perce$$ed them. Without be$$aying the lea&s;t mark of di$$rder, he rode up to the &s;erjeant, and a&s;&s;uming the character of a French general, told him in that language, that there was n$ occa$$$n for &s;uch ceremony. Then he a&s;ked, if they had perceived any of the enem$'s pa$$ies? and being an&s;w$$ed in the negative, <Q>&startq;Very well$ $word$ he$ be $span$ and if you &s;hould be attacked$ I $span$ care that you &s;hall be &s;u$tained&endq;</Q> So &s;aying, he and h$$ company retir$d before the &s;erjeant could recollect him&s;elf from the &s;urpri$e occa&s;ioned by this un|expected addre&s;s.

<P>The campaign in Italy was altogether unfavourable to the French and Spaniards. The hou&s;e of Au&s;tria being no longer pre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ide of Ger|many, was enabled to make the &s;tronger efforts in this country$ and the Bri|ti&s;h &s;ub&s;idy encouraged the king of Sardinia to act with redoubled vivacity. Marechal Mallebois occupied the greater part of Piedmont with about thirty thou&s;and men. Don Philip and the count de Gages were at the head of a greater number in the neighbourhood of Milan; and the duke of Modena, with eight thou&s;and, &s;ecured his own dominions. The king of Sardinia augmented his for$es to &s;ix and thirty thou&s;and; and the Au&s;trian army, under the prince of Lichten&s;tein$ amounted to a much greater number; &s;o that the enemy were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of acting on the defen&s;ive, and retired towards the Mantuan. In February baron Leutrum the Piedmonte&s;e general, inve&s;ted and took the &s;trong fortre&s;s of A&s;te. He afterwards relieved the citadel of Alex|andria, which the Spaniards had blocked up in the winter, reduced Ca&s;al, recovered Valencia$ and obliged Mallebois to retire to the neighbourhood of Genoa. On the other &s;ide, Don Philip and count Gages abandoned Milan, Pavi$, and Parma, re$reating before the Au&s;trians with the utmo&s;t precipitation, to $$$centia, where they were joined on the third of June by the French forces under Mallebois.</P>

<P>Before this junction was effected the Spani&s;h general Pignatelli, had pa&s;&s;ed the river Po in the night with a &s;trong detachment, and beaten up the quarters of &s;even thou&s;a$d Au&s;trians po&s;ted at Codogno. Don Philip find$ng him&s;elf at the head o$ two and fifty thou&s;and men by his junction with the French general, re&s;olved to attack the Au&s;trians in their camp at San Lazaro, before they &s;hould be reinforced by his Sardinian maje&s;ty. Accordingly, on the fourth day of June in the evening, he marched with equal &s;ilence and expedi|tion, and entered the Au&s;trian trenches about eleven, when a de&s;perate battle en&s;ued. The Au&s;trians were pr$pared for the attack, which they &s;u&s;tained with great vigour till morning. Then they quitted their intrenchments, and charged the enemy in their $word$ with &s;uch fury, that after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance the
<PB N="681" REF="6840">
combined army was broke, and retired with precipitation to Placentia, leaving on the field fifteen thou&s;and men killed, wounded, and taken, together with &s;ixty colours, and ten pieces of artillery. In a few weeks the Au&s;trians were joined by the Piedmonte&s;e: the king of Sardinia a&s;&s;umed the chief command, and prince Lichten&s;tein being indi&s;po&s;ed, his place was &s;upplied by the marquis de Botta. Don Philip retired to the other &s;ide of the Po, and extended his troops in the open country of the Milaneze. The king of Sardinia called a council of war, in which it was determined, that he &s;hould pa&s;s the river with a &s;trong body of troops, in order to &s;traiten the enemy on one &s;ide; while the marquis de Botta &s;hould march up the Tydone, to cut off their communication with Placentia. They forthwith quitted all the po&s;ts they had occupied between the Lambro and Adda, re&s;olving to repa&s;s the Po, and retreat to Tortona. With this view they threw bridges of boats over that river, and began to pa&s;s on the ninth day of Augu&s;t in the evening. They were attacked at Rotto Freddo by a detachment of Au&s;trians, under general Serbelloni, who maintained the engagement till ten in the morning, when Botta arrived: the battle was renewed with redoubled rage, and la&s;ted till four in the afternoon, when the enemy retired in great di&s;order to Tortona, with the lo&s;s of eight thou&s;and men, a good number of colours and &s;tandards, and eighteen pieces of cannon. This victory co&s;t the Au&s;trians four thou&s;and men killed upon the &s;pot, including the gallant general Bernclau. The victors immediately &s;ummoned Placentia to &s;u$render; and the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of nine thou&s;and men, were made pri|&s;oners of war: Don Philip continued his retreat, and of all his forces brought &s;ix and twenty thou&s;and only into the territories of Genoa.</P>

<P>The Piedmonte&s;e and Au&s;trians rejoining in the neighbourhood of Pavia, advanced to Tortona, of which they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without re&s;i&s;tance; while the enemy &s;heltered them&s;elves under the cannon of Genoa. They did not long continue in this &s;ituation; for on the twenty-&s;econd day of Augu&s;t they were again in motion, and retired into Provence. The court of Madrid imputing the bad &s;ucce&s;s of this campaign to the mi&s;conduct of count Gages, recalled that general, and &s;ent the marquis de las Minas to re&s;ume the command of the forces. In the mean time the victorious confederates appeared before Genoa on the fourth day of December; and the &s;enate of that city thinking it incapa|ble of defence, &s;ubmitted to a very mortifying capitulation, by which the gates were delivered up to the Au&s;trians, together with all their arms, artillery, and ammunition; and the city was &s;ubjected to the mo&s;t cruel contributions. The marquis de Botta being left at Genoa with &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, the king of Sardinia re&s;olved to pa&s;s the Var, and pur&s;ue the French and Spaniards into Provence; but, that monarch being &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox, the conduct of this expedition was intru&s;ted to count Brown, an Au&s;trian general of Iri&s;h extract, who had given repeated proofs of uncommon valour and capacity. He was on this occa&s;ion a&s;&s;i&s;ted by vice-admiral Medley, who commanded the Briti&s;h &s;quadron in the Mediterranean. The French forces had fortified the pa&s;&s;es of the Var, under the conduct of the marechal de Bellei&s;le, who thought proper to abandon his po&s;ts at the approach of count Brown; and this general, at the head of fifty thou&s;and men, pa&s;&s;ed the river without oppo&s;ition, on the ninth day of November. While he advanced as far as Draguignan, laying the open country under contribution, baron Roth, with four and twenty battalions,

inve&s;ted Antibes, which was at the &s;ame time bombarded on the &s;ide of the &s;ea by the Briti&s;h &s;quadron. The trenches were opened on the twentieth day of September; but, Bellei&s;le having a&s;&s;embled a numerous army, &s;uperior to that of the confederates, and the Genoe&s;e having expelled their Au&s;trian gu$&s;ts, count Brown abandoned the enterprize, and repa&s;&s;ed the Var, not with|out &s;ome damage from the enemy.</P>

<P>The court of Vienna, which has always patronized oppre&s;&s;ion, exacted &s;uch heavy contributions from the Genoe&s;e, and its directions were &s;o rigor|ou&s;ly put in execution, that the people were reduced to de&s;pair; and re&s;olved to make a la&s;t effort for the recovery of their l$berty and independence. Ac|cordingly they took arms in &s;ecret, &s;eized &s;everal important po&s;ts of the city; &s;urpr$$ed &s;ome battalions of the Au&s;trians; &s;urrounded oth$rs, and cut them in pieces; and in a word, drove them out with great &s;laughter. The marquis de Botta acted with caution and &s;pirit; but being overpowered by numbers, and apprehen&s;ive of the pea&s;ants in the country, who were in arms, he retreated to the pa&s;s of the Bochett$ on the &s;ide of Lombardy, where he &s;ecured him&s;elf in an advantageou$ $tuation, until he could receive reinforcements. The lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained at Genoa did not hinder him from reducing Savona, a &s;ea-port town belonging to that republic; and he afterwards made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Gavi. The Genoe&s;e, on the contrary, exerted them&s;elves with wonderful in|du&s;try in fortifying $heir city, rai&s;ing troops, and in taking other mea&s;ures for a vigorous defence, in ca&s;e they &s;hould again be in&s;ulted.</P>

<P>The naval tran&s;actions of this year reflected very little honour on the Briti&s;h nation. Commodore Peyton, who commanded &s;ix &s;hips of war in the Ea&s;t-Indies, &s;hamefully declined a deci&s;ive engagement with a French &s;quadron of inferior force; and abandoned the important &s;ettlement of Madra&s;s on the coa&s;t of Coromandel, which was taken without oppo&s;ition in the month of September, by the French commodore de la Bourdonnais. Fort St. David, and the other Briti&s;h factories in India, would have probably &s;hared the &s;ame fate, had not the enemy's naval force in that country been &s;hattered and partly de&s;troyed by a terrible tempe&s;t. No event of con&s;equence happened in America, though it was a &s;cene that &s;$$m$d to promi&s;e the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s to the arms of England. The red$ction of Cape-Breton had encouraged the mini&s;try to project the conque&s;t of Quebec, the capital of Canada, &s;ituated upon the river of St. Laurence$ Commi&s;&s;ions were &s;ent to the governors of the Briti&s;h colonies in North-America, impowering them to rai&s;e companies to join the armament from England; and eight thou&s;and troops were actually rai&s;ed in con&s;equence of the&s;e directions; while a po$erful &s;quadron and tran&s;ports, having &s;ix regiments on board, were prepared at Port&s;mouth for this expedition. But their depar|ture was po$tponed by unaccountable delays, until the &s;ea&s;on was judged too far advanced to ri&s;que the great &s;hips on the boi&s;terous coa&s;t of North-America. That the armament, howev$r, m$ght not be wholly u&s;ele&s;s to the nation, it was employed in making a de&s;cent upon the coa&s;t of Brittany$ on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that Port L'Orient, the repo&s;itory of all the &s;tores and &s;hips belonging to the French Ea&s;t-India company, might be &s;urpri&s;ed; or, that this inva&s;ion would ala$m the enemy, and, by making a diver&s;ion, facilitate the operations of the Au&s;trian general in Provence.</P>

<P>The naval force intended for this &s;ervice con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ixteen great &s;hips, and eight frigates, be&s;ides bomb-ketches, and &s;tore&s;hips, commanded by Richard Le&s;tock, appointed admiral of the blue-divi&s;ion. Six battalions of land troops, with a detachment of matro&s;&s;es and bombardiers, were embarked in thirty tran&s;ports, under the conduct of lieutenant-general Sinclair; and the whole fleet &s;et &s;ail from Plymouth on the fourteenth day of September. On the twentieth the troops were landed in Quimperlay-bay, at the di&s;tance of ten miles from Port L'Orient. The militia, reinforced by &s;ome detachments from different regiments, were a&s;&s;embled to the number of two thou&s;and, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the di&s;embarkation; but, &s;eeing the Briti&s;h troops determined to land at all events, they thought proper to retire. Next day general Sinclair advanced into the country, &s;kirmi&s;hing with the enemy in his route; and arriving at the village of Plemure, within half a league from Port L'Orient, &s;ummoned that place to &s;urrender. He was vi&s;ited by a deputation from the town, which offered to admit the Briti&s;h forces, on condition, that they &s;hould be re&s;trained from pillaging the inhabitants, and touching the magazines; and, that they &s;hould pay a ju&s;t price for their provi&s;ions. The&s;e terms being rejected, the inhabitants prepared for a vigorous defence; and the Engli&s;h general re&s;olved to b$$iege the place in form: though he had neither time, artillery, nor forces $word$ for &s;uch an enterprize. All his cannon amounted to no more than a few fie$$ pieces; and he was obliged to wait for two iron guns, which the &s;ailors $word$ up from the &s;hipping. Had he given the a&s;&s;ault on the fir&s;t night after $span$ $rrival, when the town was filled with terror and $onfu&s;ion, and d$$titute of regular troops, in all probability it would have been ea&s;$$y taken by &s;ealade. But the reduction of it was rendered impractica|ble by his $elay The ramparts were mounted with cannon from the &s;hips in the harbour; new works were rai&s;ed with great indu&s;try; the garri&s;on was reinforce$ by &s;everal bodies of regular troops, and great numbers were a&s;&s;embling from all parts; &s;o that the Briti&s;h forces were in danger of being &s;urrounded in an enemy's country. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;couragements, they opened a &s;mall battery again&s;t the town, which was &s;et on fire in &s;everal places by their bombs and re$ hot bui$ets: they likewi&s;e repul&s;ed part of the garri&s;on which had made a &s;aily to $e&s;troy their works; but their cannon producing no effect upon the fortifications, the fire from the town daily increa&s;ing, and admiral Le&s;tock declaring, in repeated me&s;&s;ages, that he could no longer expo&s;e the &s;hips on an open coa&s;t at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on of the year; general Sinclair abandoned the &s;iege; and having cau&s;ed the two iron pieces of cannon to be buried, retreated in good order to the &s;ea-&s;ide, where his troops were reimbarked, having &s;u&s;tained very incon&s;iderable damage &s;ince their fir&s;t landing. He expected reinforcements from England, and was re&s;olved to wait a little longer for their arrival, in hope of being able to annoy the enemy more effectually. In the beginning of October the fleet &s;ailed to Quiberon-bay, where they de&s;troyed a French &s;hip of war; and a detachment of the forces being landed, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fort on the penin&s;ula; while the little i&s;lands of Houvat and Heydic were reduced by the &s;ailors. In this &s;ituation the admiral and general continued till the &s;eventeenth day of the month, when the forts being di&s;mantled, and the troops reimbarked, the fleet &s;ailed from the French coa&s;t: the admiral returned to England, and the tran&s;ports with the &s;oldiers proceeded to Ireland, where they arrived in &s;afety.</P>

<P>This expedition, weak and frivolous as it may &s;eem, was re&s;ented by the French nation as one of the greate&s;t in&s;ults they had ever &s;u&s;tained; and demon&s;trated the po&s;&s;ibility of hurting France in her tendere&s;t parts, by means of an $word$ of this nature, well-timed, and vigorou&s;ly conducted.

The Briti&s;h &s;quadrons in the We&s;t Indies $word$ $word$ no exp$oit of con&s;equence in the cour&s;e of this year. The commerce was out $word$ protected.

or propo&s;al of the government and its mini&s;ters. The commons having con&s;idered the e&s;timates, voted forty thou&s;and &s;eamen for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, and about &s;ixty thou&s;and land-forces, including eleven thou&s;and five hundred marines. They granted four hundred and thirty three thou&s;and pounds to the empre&s;s queen of Hungary; three hundred thou&s;and pounds to the king of Sardinia; four hundred and ten thou&s;and pounds for the mainte|nance of eighteen thou&s;and Hanoverian auxiliaries; one hundred and &s;ixty-one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;even pounds, for &s;ix thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians; &s;ub|&s;idies to the electors of Cologne, Mentz, and Bavaria; and the &s;um of five hundred thou&s;and pounds to enable his maje&s;ty to pro&s;ecute the war with ad|vantage. In a word, the &s;upplies amounted to nine millions, four hundred twenty-five thou&s;and two hundred fifty-four pounds; a &s;um almo&s;t incredible, if we con&s;ider how the kingdom had been already drained of its trea&s;ure. It was rai&s;ed by the u&s;ual taxes, reinforced with new impo&s;itions on windows, carriages, and &s;pirituous liquors, a lottery, and loan from the &s;inking-fund. The new taxes were mortgaged for four millions by transferable annuities, at an intere&s;t of four, and a premium of ten per centum. By reflecting on the&s;e enormous grants, one would imagine the mini&s;try had been determined to im|poveri&s;h the nation; $word$ from the eagerne&s;s and expedition with which the people &s;ub&s;cribed for the money, one would conclude that the riches of the kingdom were inexhau&s;tible. It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that the &s;upplies of this year exceeded, by two millions and a half, the greate&s;t annual &s;um that was rai&s;ed during the reign of queen Anne, though &s;he maintained as great a number of troops as was now in the pay of Great Britain, and her armies and fleets acquired every year fre&s;h harve&s;ts of glory and advantage: whereas this war had proved an almo&s;t uninterrupted &s;eries of events big with di&s;a&s;ter and di&s;honour. During the la&s;t two years, the naval expence of England had ex|ceeded that of France about five millions &s;terling; though her fleets had not obtained one &s;ignal advantage over the enemy at &s;ea, nor been able to protect her commerce from their depredations. She was at once a prey to her declared adver&s;aries and profe&s;&s;ed friends. Before the end of &s;ummer, &s;he numbered among her mercenaries two empre&s;&s;es, five German princes, and a powerful monarch, whom &s;he hired to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in trimming the balance of Europe, in which they them&s;elves were immediately intere&s;ted, and &s;he had no more than a &s;econdary concern. Had the&s;e fruitle&s;s &s;ub&s;idies been &s;aved; had the na|tional revenue been applied with o$conomy to national purpo&s;es; had it been employed in liquidating gradually the public incumbrances, in augmenting the navy, improving manufactures, encouraging and &s;ecuring the colonies, and extending trade and navigation; corruption would have become altogether un|nece&s;&s;ary, and di&s;affection would have vani&s;hed: the people would have been ea&s;ed of their burthens, and cea&s;ed to complain: commerce would have flouri&s;hed, and produced &s;uch affluence as mu&s;t have rai&s;ed Great-Britain to the highe&s;t pinnacle of maritime power, above all rival&s;hip or competition. She would have been drea$$d by her enemies; revered by her neighbours: oppre&s;&s;ed na|tions would have crept under her wings for protection: contending potentates would have appealed to her deci&s;ion: and &s;he would have &s;hone the univer&s;al arb$$re&s;s or Europe.

<P>The king, in order to exhibit a &s;pecimen of his de&s;ire to dimini&s;h the public expence, ordered the third and fourth troops of his life-guards to be di&s;banded, and reduced three regiments of hor&s;e to the quality of dragoons. The hou&s;e of commons pre&s;ented an addre&s;s of thanks for this in&s;tance of oeconomy, by which the annual &s;um of &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds was &s;aved to the nation. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;eeming harmony between the king and the great council of the nation, his maje&s;ty re&s;olved, with the advice of his council, to di&s;&s;olve the pre&s;ent parliament, though the term of &s;even years was not yet expired &s;ince its fir&s;t meeting. The mini&s;try affected to in&s;inuate, that the &s;tates-general were unwilling to concur with his maje&s;ty in vigorous mea&s;ures again&s;t France, during the exi&s;tence of a parliament which had undergone &s;uch a vici&s;&s;itude of complexion. The allies of Great-Britain, far from being &s;u&s;picious of this a&s;&s;embly, which had &s;upplied them &s;o liberally, &s;aw with concern, that, according to law, it would &s;oon be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and they doubted whether another could be procured equally agreeable to their purpo&s;es. In order to remove this doubt, the mini&s;try re&s;olved to &s;urpri&s;e the kingdom with a new election, before the malcontents &s;hould be prepared to oppo&s;e the friends of the government. Accordingly, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion was di&s;|patched, the king having given the royal a&s;ient to the &s;everal acts they had prepared, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them in the month of June, with an affectionate &s;peech that breathed nothing but tenderne&s;s and gratitude. The parliament was im|mediately di&s;&s;olved by proclamation, and new writs were i&s;&s;ued for convoking another. Among the laws pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was an act aboli&s;hing the heritable juri&s;dictions, and taking away the tenor of wardholdings in Scotland, which were reckoned among the principal &s;ources of tho&s;e rebellions that had been excited &s;ince the revolution. In the Highlands, they certainly kept the common people in &s;ubjection to their chiefs, whom they implicitly followed and obeyed in all their undertakings. By this act the&s;e mountaineers were le|gally emancipated from &s;lavery: but as the tenants enjoyed no lea&s;es, and were at all times liable to be ejected from their tarms, they &s;till depended on the plea&s;ure of their lords, notwith&s;tanding this interpo&s;ition of the legi&s;lature, which granted a valuable con&s;ideration in money to every nobleman and petty baron, who was thus deprived of one part of his inheritance. The forfeited e&s;tates, indeed, were divided into &s;mall farms, and let by the government on lea&s;es at an under-value; &s;o that tho&s;e who had the good fortune to obtain &s;uch lea&s;es ta&s;ted the &s;weets of independence: but the Highlanders in general were left in their original indigence and incapacity, at the mercy of their &s;uperiors. Had manufactures and fi&s;heries been e&s;tabli&s;hed in different parts of their country, they would have &s;een and felt the happy con&s;equences of indu&s;try, and in a little time been effectually detached from all their &s;lavi&s;h connections.</P>

<P>The operations of the campaign had been concerted in the winter, at the Hague, between the duke of Cumberland and the &s;tates-general of the
<PB N="687" REF="6900">
United-Provinces, who were by this time generally convinced of France's de|&s;ign to encroach upon their territories. They therefore determined to take ef|fectual mea&s;ures again&s;t that re&s;tle&s;s and ambitious neighbour. The allied powers agreed to a&s;&s;emble a va&s;t army in the Netherlands; and it was re&s;olved that the Au&s;trians and Piedmonte&s;e &s;hould once more penetrate into Provence. The Dutch patriots, however, were not rou&s;ed into this exertion, until all their remon&s;trances had failed at the court of Ver&s;ailles; until they had been urged by repeated memorials of the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, and &s;timulated by the im|mediate danger to which their country was expo&s;ed: for France was by this time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the Au&s;trian Netherlands, and &s;eemed bent upon pene|trating into the territories of the United-Provinces. In February, the duke of Cumberland began to a&s;&s;emble the allied forces; and in the latter end of March they took the field in three &s;eparate bodies. His royal highne&s;s, with the Engli&s;h, Hanoverians, and He&s;&s;ians, fixed his head quarters at the village of Tilberg: the prince of Waldeck was po&s;ted with the Dutch troops at Breda; and marechal Bathiani collected the Au&s;trians and Bavarians in the neighbour|hood of Venlo. The whole army amounted to one hundred and twenty thou|&s;and men, who lay inactive &s;ix weeks, expo&s;ed to the inclemency of the weather, and almo&s;t de&s;titute of forage and provi&s;ion. Count Saxe, by this time created marechal-general of France, continued his troops within their cantonements at Bruges, Antwerp, and Bru&s;&s;els, declaring, that when the allied army &s;hould be weakened by &s;ickne&s;s and mortality, he would convince the duke of Cumberland, that the fir&s;t duty of a general is to provide for the health and pre&s;ervation of his troops. In April this fortunate commander took the field, at the head of one hundred and forty thou&s;and men; and the count de Clermont commanded a &s;eparate body of ninteen battalions and thirty &s;quadrons. Count Lowendahl was detached on the &s;ixteenth day of the month, with &s;even and twenty thou&s;and men, to invade Dutch Flanders: at the &s;ame time, the French mini&s;ter at the Hague pre&s;ented a memorial to the &s;tates, intimating, that his ma&s;ter was obliged to take this &s;tep by the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of war: but that his troops &s;hould ob&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;cipline, without interfering with the religion, government, or commerce of the re|public: that the countries and places of which he might be obliged to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be detained no otherwi&s;e than as a pledge, to be re&s;tored as &s;oon as the United-Provinces &s;hould give convincing proofs that they would no longer furni&s;h the enemies of France with &s;uccours.</P>

<P>While the &s;tates deliberated upon this declaration, count Lowen|dahl entered Dutch Brabant, and inve&s;ted the town and fortre&s;s of Sluys, the garri&s;on of which &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war on the nineteenth day of April. This was likewi&s;e the fate of Sas-van Ghent; while the mar|quis de Contades, with another detachment reduced the forts Perle and Leif|ken&s;hoek, with the town of Philippine, even within hearing of the confederate army. The fort of Sanberg was vigorou&s;ly defended by two Engli&s;h battalions; but they were overpowered and obliged to retire to Wel&s;thoorden; and count Lowendahl undertook the &s;iege of Hul&s;t, which was &s;hamefully &s;urrendered by La Roque the Dutch governor, though he knew that a reinforcement of nine battalions was on the march to his relief. Then the French general took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Axel and Terneu&s;e, and began to prepare flat-bottomed boats for

The vigorous con&s;equences of this re&s;olution immediately appeared. All commerce and contracts with the French were prohibited: the pea&s;ants were armed and exerci&s;ed: a re&s;olution pa&s;&s;ed for making a con|&s;iderable augmentation of the army: a council of war was e&s;tabli&s;hed, for inquiring into the conduct of the governors, who had given up the frontier places; and orders were i&s;&s;ued to commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t the French, both by &s;ea and land.</P>

<P>Mean while, the duke of Cumberland took po&s;t with his whole army between the two Nethes, to cover Bergen-op Zoom and Mae&s;tricht; and marechal Saxe called in his detachments, with a view to hazard a general engagement. In the latter end of May, the French king arrived at Bru&s;&s;els; and his general re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege of Mae&s;tricht. For this pur|po&s;e he advanced towards Louvain; and the confederates perceiving his drift, began their march to take po&s;t between the town and the enemy. On the twentieth day of June, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ground, and were drawn up in order of battle, with their right at Bil&s;en, and their left extending to Wir$$, within a mile of Mae&s;tricht, having in the front of their left wing the village of Laffel$t, in which they po&s;ted &s;everal battalions of Briti&s;h infantry. The French had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights of Herdeeren, immediately above the allies; and both armies cannonaded each other till the evening. In the morning, the enemy's infantry marched down the hill, in a prodigious column, and attacked the village of La$$eldt, which was well fortified and defended with &s;urpri&s;ing ob&s;tinacy. The a&s;&s;ailants &s;uffered terribly in their approach, from the cannon of the confederates, which was &s;erved with &s;ur|pri&s;ing <NOTE PLACE="marg"># Not the per&s;on who commanded in the We&s;t-Indies.</NOTE>

dexterity and &s;ucce&s;s; and they met with &s;uch a warm reception from the Briti&s;h mu&s;quetry as they could not with&s;tand: but, when they were broken and di&s;per&s;ed, fre&s;h brigades &s;ucceeded with a&s;toni&s;hing per&s;everance. The con|federates were driven out of the village; yet being &s;u&s;tained by three regiments, they mea&s;ured back their ground, and repul&s;ed the enemy with great &s;laughter. Neverthele&s;s, count Saxe continued pouring in other battalions; and the French regained and maintained their footing in the village, after it had been three times lo&s;t and carried. The action was chiefly confined to this po&s;t, where the field exhibited a horrible &s;cene of carnage. At noon the duke of Cumberland ordered the whole left wing to advance again&s;t the enemy, who&s;e infantry gave way: prince Waldeck led up the centre, marechal Bathiani made a motion with the right wing towards Herdeeren, and victory &s;eemed ready to declare for the confederates; when the fortune of the day took a &s;udden turn to their prejudice. Several &s;quadrons of Dutch hor&s;e, po&s;ted in the centre, gave way, and flying at full gallop, overthrew five battalions of infantry that were ad|vancing from the body of re&s;erve. The French cavalry charged them with great impetuo&s;ity, increa&s;ing the confu&s;ion that was already produced, and penetrating through the lines of the allied army, which was thus divided about the centre. The duke of Cumberland, who exerted him&s;elf with equal cou|rage and activity, in attempting to remedy this di&s;order, was in danger of being taken; and the defeat would, in all probability, have been total, had not Sir John Ligonier taken the re&s;olution of &s;acrificing him&s;elf and a part of the troops to the &s;afety of the army. At the head of three Briti&s;h regiments of dragoons, and &s;ome &s;quadrons of Imperial hor&s;e, he charged the whole line of the French cavalry, with &s;uch intrepidity and &s;ucce&s;s, that he over|threw all that oppo&s;ed him, and made &s;uch a diver&s;ion as enabled the duke of Cumberland to effect an orderly retreat to Mae&s;tricht. He him&s;elf was taken by a French carabineer, after his hor&s;e had been killed; but the regiments he commanded retired with deliberation. The confederates retreated to Mae|&s;tricht, without having &s;u&s;tained much damage from the pur&s;uit, and even brought off all their artillery except &s;ixteen pieces of cannon. Their lo&s;s did not $span$ &s;ix thou&s;and men killed and taken; whereas the French general $span$ at a much greater expence. The common cau&s;e of the $span$ is &s;aid to have &s;uffered from the pride and ignorance of their $span$ the eve of the battle, when the detachment of the count de $span$ on the hill of Herdeeren, marechal Bathiani a&s;ked $span$ in chief to attack them before they &s;hould be $span$ he would an&s;wer for the &s;ucce&s;s of the enterprize.

He replied, <Q>&startq;I &s;hall $span$ be found at the head of my troops,&endq;</Q> and retired in di&s;gu&s;t. The $span$ di&s;po&s;ition has likewi&s;e been blamed, ina&s;much as not above one half of the army could act, while the enemy exerted their whole force.</P>

<P>The confederates pa&s;&s;ed the Ma$&s;e, and encamped in the dutchy of Limburg, &s;o as to cover Mae&s;tricht; while the French king remained with his army in the neighbourhood of Tongres. Marechal Saxe, having amu&s;ed the allies with marches and counter-marches, at length detached count Lowen|dahl with &s;ix and thirty thou&s;and men to be&s;iege Bergen-op-zoom, the &s;tronge&s;t
<PB N="690" REF="6930">
fortification of Datch Braban$, the favourite work of the famous engineer Cochorn, never conquered, and generally e&s;teemed invincible. It was &s;ecured with a garri&s;on of three thou&s;and men, and well provided with artillery, am|munition, and magazines. The enemy appeared before it on the twelfth day of July, and &s;ummoned the governor to &s;urrender. The prince of Saxe-Hild|burghau&s;en was &s;ent to its relief, with twenty battalions and fourteen &s;quadrons of the troops that could be mo&s;t conveniently a&s;&s;embled: he entered the lines of Bergen-op-zoom, where he remained in expectation of a &s;trong reinforce|ment from the confederate army; and the old baron Cron&s;trom, whom the &s;tadtholder had appointed governor of Brabant, a&s;&s;umed the command of the garri&s;on. The be&s;iegers carried on their operations with great vivacity; and the troops in the town defended it with equal vigour. The eyes of all Europe were turned upon this important &s;iege$ count Lowendahl received divers rein|forcements; and a con&s;iderable body of troops was detached from the allied army, under the command of baron Schwartzemberg$ to co-operate with the prince of S$xe-Hildburghau&s;en. The French general lo&s;t a great number of men by the clo&s;e and continual fire of the be&s;ieged; while he, in his turn, opened &s;uch a number of batteries, and plied them &s;o warmly, that the defences began to give way. From the &s;ixteenth day of July to the fifteenth of Sep|tember, the &s;iege produced an unintermitting &s;cene of horror and de&s;truction: de&s;perate &s;allies were made, and mines &s;prung with the mo&s;t dreadful effects: the works began to be &s;hartered, the town was laid in a&s;hes, the trenches were filled with carnage: nothing was &s;een but fire and &s;moke; nothing heard but one continued roar of bombs and cannon. But, &s;till the damage fell chiefly on the be&s;iegers, who were &s;lain in heaps; while the garri&s;on &s;uffered very little, and could be occa&s;ionally relieved or reinforced from the lines. In a word, it was generally believed that count Lowendahl would be baffled in his endea|vours; and by this belief the governor of Bergen-op-zoom &s;eems to have been lulled into a blind &s;ecurity. At length, &s;ome incon&s;iderable breaches were made in one ravelin and two ba&s;tions, and the&s;e the French general re&s;olved to &s;torm, though Cron&s;trom believed they were impracticable; and on that &s;up|po&s;ition, pre&s;umed that the enemy would not attempt an a&s;&s;ault. For this very rea&s;on count Lowendahl re&s;olved to hazard the attack, before the preparations &s;hould be made for his reception. He accordingly regulated his di&s;po&s;itions, and at four o'clock in the morning, on the &s;ixteenth day of September, the &s;ignal was made for the a&s;&s;ault. A prodigious quantity of bombs being thrown into the $avelin, his troops threw them&s;elves into the fo&s;&s;e, mounted the breaches, forced open a &s;ally-port, and entered the place, almo&s;t without re&s;i&s;tance. In a word, they had time to extend them&s;elves along the curtains, and form in order of battle, before the garri&s;on could be a&s;&s;embled. Con&s;trom was a&s;leep, and the &s;oldiers upon duty had been &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;uddenne&s;s and impetuo&s;ity of the attack. Though the French had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ramparts, they did not gain the town without oppo&s;ition. Two battalions of the Scotti&s;h troops, in the pay of the &s;tates-general, were a&s;&s;embled in the market-place, and attacked them with &s;uch fury, that they were driven from &s;treet to &s;treet, until fre&s;h reinforcements arriving, compelled the Scots to retreat in their turn: yet, they di&s;puted every inch of ground, and fought until two thirds of them were killed upon the &s;pot. Then they brought off the old governor, abandon|ing

the town to the enemy: while the troops that were encamped in the lines retreating with great precipitation, all the forts in the neighbourhood imme|diately &s;urrendered to the victors, who now became ma&s;ters of the whole navi|gation of the Schelde. The French king was no &s;ooner informed of Lowen|dahl's &s;ucce&s;s, than he promoted him to the rank of marechal of France, ap|pointed count Saxe governor of the conquered Netherlands, and returned in triumph to Ver&s;ailles. In a little time after this tran&s;action, both armies were di&s;tributed into winter-quarters, and the duke of Cumberland embarked for England.</P>

<P>In Italy the French arms did not triumph with equal &s;ucce&s;s, though the marechal de Bellei&s;le &s;aw him&s;elf at the head of a powerful army in Provence. In April he pa&s;&s;ed the Var without oppo&s;ition, and took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Nice. He met with little or no re&s;i&s;tance in reducing Montalban, Villa|franca, and Ventimiglia; while general Brown, with eight and twenty thou&s;and Au&s;trians, retired towards Final and Savona. In the mean time, another large body under count Schuylemberg, who had &s;ucceeded the marquis de Botta, co|operated with fifteen thou&s;and Piedmonte&s;e in an attempt to recover the city of Genoa. The French king had &s;ent thither &s;upplies, &s;uccours, and engineers, with the duke de Boufflers as amba&s;&s;ador to the republic, who likewi&s;e acted as commander in chief of the forces employed for its defence. The Au&s;trian general a&s;&s;embled his troops in the Milane&s;e: having forced the pa&s;&s;age of the Bochetta on the thirteenth of January, he advanced into the territories of Genoa, and the Riviera was ravaged without mercy. On the la&s;t day of March he appeared before the city at the head of forty thou&s;and men, and &s;ummoned the revolters to lay down their arms. The an&s;wer he received was, that the republic had fifty-four thou&s;and men in arms, two hundred and &s;ixty cannon, thirty-four mortars, with abundance of ammunition and provi&s;ion: that they would defend their liberty with their la&s;t blood, and be buried in the ruins of their capital, rather than &s;ubmit to the clemency of the court of Vienna, except by an honourable capitulation guarantied by the kings of Great-Britain and Sardinia, the republic of Venice, and the United Provinces. In the beginning of May, Genoa was inve&s;ted on all &s;ides: a furious &s;ally was made by the duke de Boufflers, who drove the be&s;iegers from their po&s;ts; but the Au&s;trians ral|lying, he was repul&s;ed in his turn, with the lo&s;s of &s;even hundred men. General Schuylemberg carried on his operations with &s;uch &s;kill, vigour, and intrepidity, that he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the &s;uburbs of Bi&s;agno; and in all probability would have reduced the city, had not he been obliged to de&s;i&s;t, in con&s;equence of the repeated remon&s;trances made by the king of Sardinia and count Brown, who repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of his abandoning his enterprize, and drawing off his army, to cover Piedmont and Lombardy from the efforts of marechal de Bellei&s;le. Accordingly he rai&s;ed the &s;iege on the tenth day of June, and returned into the Milane&s;e, in order to join his Satdinian maje&s;ty; while the Genoe&s;e made an irruption into the Parme&s;an and Pla$entin, where they committed terrible outrages, in revenge for the mi&s;chiefs they had under|gone.</P>

<P>While the marechal de Bellei&s;le remained at Ventimiglia, his bro|ther, at the head of four and thirty thou&s;and French and Spaniards, attempted to penetrate into Piedmont: on the &s;ixth day of July he arrived at the pa&s;s of
<PB N="692" REF="6950">
E$illes, a &s;trong fortre&s;s on the frontiers of Dauphin&eacute;, &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of the river Doria. The defence of this important po&s;t the king of Sar|dinia had committed to the care of the count de Brigueras, who formed an encampment behind the lines with fourteen battalions of Piedmonte&s;e and Au&s;trians, while divers detachments were po&s;ted along all the pa&s;&s;es of the Alps. On the eighth day of the month the Piedmonte&s;e intrenc$ments were attacked by the chevalier de Bellei&s;le, with incredible intrepidity; but the columns were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive attacks. Impatient of this ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition, and determined not to &s;urvive a mi&s;carriage, this impetuous general &s;eized a pair of colours, and advancing at the head of his troops, through a prodigious fire, pitched them with his own hand on the ene|my's intrenchments. At that in&s;tant he fell dead, having received two mu&s;ket|balls and the thru&s;t of a bayonet in his body. The a&s;&s;ailants were &s;o much di&s;pirited by the death of their commander, that they forthwith gave way, and retreated with precipitation towards Se&s;trieres, having lo&s;t near five thou&s;and men in the attack. The marechal was no &s;ooner informed of his brother's misfortune than he retreated towards the Var, to join the troops from Exilles: while the king of Sardinia, having a&s;&s;embled an army of &s;eventy thou&s;and men, threatened Dauphin&eacute; with an inva&s;ion; but the exce&s;&s;ive rains prevented the execution of his de&s;ign. General Leutrum was detached with twenty battalions to drive the French from Ventimiglia; but, Bellei&s;le marching back, that &s;cheme was likewi&s;e fru&s;trated: and thus ended the campaign.</P>

<P>In this manner was the French king baffled in his projects upon Italy; nor was he more fortunate in his naval operations. He had, in the preceding year, equipped an expen&s;ive armament under the command of the duke d'Anville, for the recovery of Cape Breton; but it was rendered ineffec|tual by &s;torms, di&s;tempers, and the death of the commander. Not yet di&s;|couraged by the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, he re&s;olved to renew his efforts again&s;t the Briti&s;h colonies in North-America, and their &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t-Indies. For the&s;e purpo&s;es two &s;quadrons were prepared at Bre&s;t, one to be commanded by the commodore De la Jonquiere; and the other, de&s;tined for India, by mon&s;ieur de St. George. The mini&s;try of Great-Britain, being apprized of the&s;e mea&s;ures, re&s;olved to intercept both &s;quadrons, which were to &s;et &s;ail $ogether. For this purpo&s;e vice-admiral An&s;on and rear-admiral Warren took their departure from Plymouth with a formidable fleet, and &s;teered their cour&s;e to Cape Fini&s;terre on the coa&s;t of Gallicia. On the third day of May they fell in with the French &s;quadrons commanded by La Jonquiere and St. George, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix large &s;hips of war, as many frigates, and four armed ve&s;&s;els equipped by their Ea&s;t-India company, having under their convoy about thirty &s;hips laden with merchandize. Tho&s;e prepared for war immediately &s;hortened &s;ail, and formed a line of battle; while the re&s;t, under the pro|tection of the &s;ix frigates, proceeded on their voyage with all the &s;ail they could carry. The Briti&s;h &s;quadron was likewi&s;e drawn up in line of battle: but Mr. Warren perceiving that the enemy began to &s;heer off, now their convoy was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, advi&s;ed admiral An&s;on to haul in the &s;ignal for the line, and hoi&s;t another for giving chace and engaging, otherwi&s;e the French would in all probability e&s;cape by favour of the night. The propo&s;al was embraced; and in a little time the engagement began with great fury, about
<PB N="693" REF="6960">
four o'clock in the afternoon. The enemy &s;u&s;tained the battle with equal con|duct and valour, until they were overpowered by numbers, and then they &s;truck their colours. The admiral detached three &s;hips in pur&s;uit of the con|voy, nine &s;ail of which were taken; but the re&s;t were &s;aved by the intervening darkne&s;s. About &s;even hundred of the French were killed and wounded in this action. The Engli&s;h lo&s;t about five hundred; and among the&s;e, captain Grenville, commander of the &s;hip Defiance. He was nephew to the lord vi&s;|count Cobham, a youth of the mo&s;t amiable character and promi&s;ing genius, animated with the noble&s;t &s;entiments of honour and patrioti&s;m. Eager in the pur&s;uit of glory, he ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of the battle, where both his legs were cut off by a cannon-ball. He &s;ubmitted to his fate with the mo&s;t heroic re&s;ignation, and died univer&s;ally lamented and beloved. The &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms, in this engagement, was chiefly owing to the conduct, activity, and courage of the rear-admiral. A con&s;iderable quantity of bullion was found in the prizes, which were brought to Spithead in triumph; and the trea&s;ure being landed, was conveyed in twenty waggons to the bank of London. Admiral An&s;on was ennobled, and Mr. Warren honoured with the order of the Bath.</P>

<P>About the middle of June, commodore Fox with &s;ix &s;hips of war crui&s;ing in the latitude of Cape Ortegal in Gallicia, took above forty French &s;hips richly laden from St. Domingo, after they had been abandoned by their convoy. But the French king &s;u&s;tained another more important lo&s;s at &s;ea, in the month of October. Rear-admiral Hawke &s;ailed from Plymouth in the beginning of Augu&s;t, with fourteen &s;hips of the line, to intercept a fleet of French merchant-&s;hips bound for the We&s;t-Indies. He crui&s;ed for &s;ome time on the coa&s;t of Brittany; and at length the French fleet &s;ailed from the i&s;le of Aix, under convoy of nine &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates, commanded by mon&s;ieur de Letenduer. On the fourteenth day of October the two &s;quadrons were in &s;ight of each other, in the latitude of Bellei&s;le. The French commo|dore immediately ordered one of his great &s;hips and the frigates to proceed with the trading &s;hips, while he formed the line of battle and waited the attack. At eleven in the forenoon admiral Hawke di&s;played the &s;ignal to chace, and in half an hour both fleets were engaged. The battle la&s;ted till night, when all the French &s;quadron, except the Intrepide and Tonant, had &s;truck to the Engli&s;h flag. The&s;e two capital &s;hips e&s;caped in the dark, and returned to Bre&s;t in a &s;hattered condition. The French captains &s;u&s;tained the unequal $$ght with uncommon bravery and re&s;olution, and did not yield until their &s;hips were di&s;abled. Their lo&s;s in men amounted to eight hundred: the number of Engli&s;h killed in this engagement did not exceed two hundred, including captain Saumarez, a gallant officer, who had &s;erved under lord An&s;on in his expedition to the Pacific Ocean. Indeed, it mu&s;t be owned, for the honour of that nobleman, that all the officers formed under his example, and rai&s;ed by his influence, approved them&s;elves in all re&s;pects worthy of the com|mands to which they were preferred. Immediately after the action, admiral Hawke di&s;patched a &s;loop to commodore Legge, who&s;e &s;quadron was &s;tationed at the Leeward I&s;lands, with intelligence of the French fleet of merchant|&s;hips, outward bound, that he might take the proper mea&s;ures for intercepting them in their pa&s;&s;age to Martinique, and the other French i&s;lands. In con&s;e|quence
<PB N="694" REF="6970">
of this advice, he redoubled his vigilance, and a good number of them fell into his hands. Admiral Hawke conducted his prizes to Spithead: and in his letter to the board of admiralty declared, that all his captains behaved like men of honour during the engagement, except Mr. Fox, who&s;e conduct he de&s;ired might be &s;ubjected to an inquiry. That gentleman was accordingly tried by a court-martial, and &s;u&s;pended from his command, for having fol|lowed the advice of his officers, contrary to his own better judgment: but he was &s;oon re&s;tored, and afterwards promoted to the rank of admiral; while Mr Matthews, who&s;e courage never incurred &s;u&s;picion, &s;till laboured under a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, for that which had been &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed in both the&s;e late engagements, namely, engaging the enemy without any regard to the line of battle.</P>

<P>In the Mediterranean vice-admiral Medley blocked up the Spa|ni&s;h &s;quadron in Carthagena; a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Au&s;trian general on the coa&s;t of Villafranca; and intercepted &s;ome of the &s;uccours &s;ent from France to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Genoe&s;e. At his death, which happened in the beginning of Augu&s;t, the command of that &s;quadron devolved upon rear-admiral Byng, who proceeded on the &s;ame plan of operation. In the &s;ummer, two Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, having under their convoy a fleet of merchant &s;hips bound to North America, fell in with the Glorio&s;o, a Spani&s;h &s;hip of eighty guns, in the latitude of the We&s;tern I&s;les. She had &s;ailed from the Havannah, with an im|men&s;e trea&s;ure on board, and mu&s;t have fallen a prize to the Engli&s;h &s;hips, had each captain done his duty. Captain Er&s;kine in the Warwick of &s;ixty guns, attacked her with great intrepidity, and fought until his &s;hip was entirely di&s;abled: but being un&s;u&s;tained by his con&s;ort, he was obliged to haul off, and the Glorio&s;o arrived in &s;afety at Ferrol; there the &s;ilver was landed, and &s;he proceeded on her voyage to Cadiz, which, however, &s;he did not reach. She was encountered by the Dartmouth, a Briti&s;h frigate of forty guns, commanded by captain Hamilton, a gallant youth, who, notwith&s;tanding the inequality of force, engaged her without he&s;itation: but, in the heat of the action, his &s;hip being &s;et on fire by accident, was blown up, and he peri&s;hed with all his crew, except a mid&s;hipman and ten or eleven &s;ailors, who were taken up alive by a privateer that happened to be in &s;ight. Favourable as this accident may &s;eem to the Glorio&s;o, &s;he did not e&s;cape. An Engli&s;h &s;hip of eighty guns, under the command of captain Buckle, came up, and obliged the Spaniards to &s;urrender, after a &s;hort, but vigorous engagement. Commodore Griffin had been &s;ent with a reinforcement of &s;hips, to a&s;&s;ume the command of the &s;quadron in the Ea&s;t-Indies; and although his arrival &s;ecured Fort St. David's, and the other Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in that country, from the in&s;ults of mon&s;ieur de la Bourdon|nais, his &s;trength was not &s;ufficient to enable him to undertake any enterprize of importance again&s;t the enemy: the mini&s;try of England therefore re&s;olved to equip a fre&s;h armament, that when joined by the &s;hips in India, &s;hould be in a condition to be&s;iege Pondicherry, the principal &s;ettlement belonging to the French on the coa&s;t of Coromandel. For this &s;ervice, a good number of in|dependent companies was rai&s;ed, and &s;et &s;ail, in the &s;equel, with a &s;trong &s;qua|dron under the conduct of rear-admiral Bo&s;cawen, an officer of unque&s;tioned valour and capacity. In the cour&s;e of this year, the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers were &s;o alert and &s;ucce&s;sful, that they took &s;ix hundred and forty-four prizes from the

French and Spaniards, whereas the lo&s;s of Great-Britain, in the &s;ame time, did not exceed five hundred and fifty.</P>

<P>All the belligerant powers were, by this time, heartily tired of a war which had con&s;umed an immen&s;ity of trea&s;ure, had been productive of &s;o much mi&s;chief, and in the events of which, all in their turns, had found them&s;elves di&s;appointed. Immediately after the battle of La&s;&s;eldt, the king of France had, in a per&s;onal conver&s;ation with Sir John Ligonier, expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire of a pacification; and afterwards his mini&s;ter at the Hague pre&s;ented a declaration on the &s;ame &s;ubject, to the deputies of the &s;tates-general. The &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms at &s;ea, confirmed him in the&s;e &s;entiments, which were likewi&s;e reinforced by a variety of other con&s;iderations. His finances were almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, and his &s;upplies from the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies, rendered &s;o precarious by the vigilance of the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers, that he could no longer depend upon their arrival. The trading part of his &s;ubjects had &s;u&s;tained &s;uch lo&s;&s;es, that his kingdom was filled with bankruptcies; and the be&s;t part of his navy now contributed to &s;trengthen the fleets of his enemies. The election of a &s;tadtholder had united the whole power of the &s;tates-general again&s;t him, in taking the mo&s;t re&s;olute mea&s;ures for their own &s;afety: his views in Germany were entirely fru&s;trated by the elevation of the grand duke to the Imperial throne, and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace between the hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Brandenburgh: the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms in Italy, had not at all an&s;wered his ex|pectation: and Genoa was become an expen&s;ive ally He had the mortification to &s;ee the commerce of Britain flouri&s;h in the mid&s;t of war, while his own people were utterly impoveri&s;hed. The parliament of England granted, and the nation payed, &s;uch incredible &s;ums as enabled their &s;overeign, not only to maintain invin|cible navies and formidable armies, but likewi&s;e to give &s;ub&s;idies to all the powers of Europe. He knew that a treaty of this kind was actually upon the anvil between his Britannic maje&s;ty and the Czarina, and he began to be apprehen&s;ive of &s;eeing an army of Ru&s;&s;ians in the Netherlands. His fears from this quar|ter were not without foundation. In the month of November, the earl of Hyndford, amba&s;&s;ador from the king of Great-Britain at the court of Ru&s;&s;ia, concluded a treaty of &s;ub&s;idy, by which the Czarina engaged to hold in readine&s;s thirty thou&s;and men, and forty gallies, to be employed in the &s;ervice of the confederates, on the fir&s;t requi&s;ition. The &s;tates-general acceded to this agreement, and even con&s;ented to pay one-fourth of the &s;ub&s;idy. His mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, moved by the&s;e con&s;iderations, made farther advances towards an accommodation both at the Hague and in London; and the contending powers agreed to another congre&s;s, which was actually opened in March at Aix|la-Chapelle, where the earl of Sandwich, and Sir Thomas Robin&s;on, a&s;&s;i&s;ted as plenipotentiaries from the king of Great-Britain.</P>

<P>The elections for the new parliament in England, had been con|ducted &s;o as fully to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of the duke of Newca&s;tle, and his brother Mr. Pelham, who had for &s;ome time wholly engro&s;&s;ed the admini&s;tra|tion. Both hou&s;es were a&s;&s;embled on the tenth day of November, when Mr. On&s;low was unanimou&s;ly re elected &s;peaker of the commons. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened, as u&s;ual, by a &s;peech from the throne, congratulating them on the &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Briti&s;h navy, and the happy alteration in the government of the United Provinces. His maje&s;ty gave them to under&s;tand, that a congre&s;s
<PB N="696" REF="6990">
would &s;peedily be opened at Aix-la-Chapelle, to concert the means for effecting a general pacification; and reminded them that nothing would more conduce to the &s;ucce&s;s of this negotiation than the vigour and unanimity of their proceedings. He received &s;uch addre&s;&s;es as the mini&s;ters were plea&s;ed to dictate. Oppo&s;ition now langui&s;hed at their feet. The duke of Bedford was become a courtier, and in a little time appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in the room of the earl of Che&s;terfield, who had lately executed that office which he now re&s;igned; and the earl of Sandwich no longer harrangued again&s;t the ad|mini&s;tration. This new hou&s;e of commons, in imitation of the liberality of their predece&s;&s;ors, rea$dy gratified all the reque&s;ts of the government. They voted forty thou&s;and &s;eamen, forty-nine thou&s;and land-forces, be&s;ides eleven thou&s;and five hundred marines; the &s;ub&s;idies for the queen of Hungary, the czarina, the king of Sardinia, the electors of Mentz and Bavaria, the He&s;&s;ians, and the duke of Wolfembuttle: the &s;um of two hundred thirty-five thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-nine pounds, was granted to the provinces of New England, to re imbur&s;e them for the expence of reducing Cape-Breton; five hundred thou&s;and pounds were given to his maje&s;ty for the vigorous pro&s;ecution of the war; and about one hundred and fifty two thou&s;and pounds to the Scotti&s;h claimants, in lieu of their juri&s;diction. The &s;upplies for the en&s;uing year fell very little &s;hort of nine millions, of which the greater part was rai&s;ed on a loan by &s;ub&s;cription, chargeable on a new &s;ub&s;idy of poundage, exacted from all merchandize imported into Great-Britain. Immediately after the rebellion was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the legi&s;lature had e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome regulations in Scotland, which were thought nece&s;&s;ary to prevent &s;uch commotions for the future. The Highlanders were di&s;armed, and an act pa&s;&s;ed, for aboli&s;hing their peculiarity of garb, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to keep up party-di&s;tinctons, to encourage their martial di&s;po&s;ition, and pre&s;erve the memory of the exploits atchieved by their ance&s;tors. In this &s;e&s;&s;ion a bill was brought in to enforce the execution of that law, and pa&s;&s;ed with another act, for the more effectual puni&s;hment of high trea&s;on in the Highlands of Scotland. The practice of in&s;uring French and Spani&s;h &s;hips at London, being deemed the &s;ole circum&s;tance that prevented a total &s;tagna|tion of commerce in tho&s;e countries, it was prohibited by law under &s;evere penalties; and this &s;tep of the Briti&s;h parliament, accelerated the conclu&s;ion of the treaty. Several other prudent mea&s;ures were taken in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, for the benefit of the public; and among the&s;e, we may reckon an act for encouraging the manufacture of indigo in the Briti&s;h plantations of North America; an article for which Great-Britain u&s;ed to pay two hundred thou&s;and pounds yearly to the &s;ubjects of France. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed on the thir|teenth<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ C$. 1$$$.</NOTE> day of May, when the king declared to both hou&s;es, that the prelimi|naries of a general peace were actually &s;igned at Aix-la-Chapelle by the mi|ni&s;ters of Great-Britain, France, and the United-Provinces; and that the ba&s;is of this accommodation was a general re&s;titution of the conque&s;ts which had been made during the war. Immediately after the prorogation of parliament, his maje&s;ty &s;et out for his German dominions, after having appointed a regency to rule the realm in his ab&s;ence.</P>

<P>The articles might have been much le&s;s unfavourable to Great-Britain and her allies, had the mini&s;try made a proper u&s;e of the treaty with the czarina; and if the confederates had acted with more vigour and expedition
<PB N="697" REF="7000">
in the beginning of the campaign. The Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries might have been tran&s;ported by &s;ea to Lubeck, before the end of the preceding &s;ummer, in their own gallies which had been lying ready for u&s;e &s;ince the month of July. Had this expedient been u&s;ed, the Ru&s;&s;ian troops might have joined the confederate army before the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t campaign. But this ea&s;y and expeditious me|thod of conveyance was rejected for a march by land, of incredible length and difficulty, which could not be begun before the month of January, nor accompli&s;hed till Mid&s;ummer. The operations of the campaign had been con|certed at the Hague in January, by the re&s;pective mini&s;ters of the allies, who re&s;olved to bring an army of one hundred and ninety thou&s;and men into the Netherlands, in order to compel the French to abandon the barrier which they had conquered. The towns of Holland became the &s;cenes of tumult and in|&s;urrection. The populace plundered the farmers of the revenue, aboli&s;hed the taxes, and in&s;ulted the magi&s;trates; &s;o that the &s;tates-general &s;eeing their country on the brink of anarchy and confu&s;ion, authorized the prince of Orange to make &s;uch alterations as he &s;hould &s;ee convenient. They pre&s;ented him with a diploma, by which he was con&s;tituted hereditary &s;tadtholder and captain-general of Dutch Brabant, Flanders, and the upper quarter of Guelderland; and the Ea&s;t-India company appointed him director and governor-general of their commerce and &s;ettlements in the Indies. Thus inve&s;ted with an autho|rity unknown to his ance&s;tors, he exerted him&s;elf with equal indu&s;try and di&s;cretion in new-modelling, augmenting, and a&s;&s;embling the troops of the republic. The confederates knew that the count de S$xe had a de&s;ign upon Mae&s;tricht: the Au&s;trian general Bathiani made repeated remon&s;trances to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, intreating them to take &s;peedy mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervations of that fortre&s;s. He in the month of January propo&s;ed, that the duke of Cumberland &s;hould cro&s;s the &s;ea, and confer with the prince of Orange on this &s;ubject: he undertook, at the peril of his head, to cover Mae&s;tricht with &s;eventy thou&s;and men, from all attacks of the enemy: but his repre&s;enta|tions &s;eemed to have made very little impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed. The duke of Cumberland did not depart from England till towards the latter end of February: part of March was elap&s;ed, before the tran&s;ports &s;ailed from the Nore with the additional troops and artillery; and the la&s;t draughts from the foot-guards were not embarked till the middle of Augu&s;t.</P>

<P>The different bodies of the confederated forces joined each other, and encamped in the neighbourhood of Ruremonde, to the number of one hun|dred and ten thou&s;and men; and the French army inve&s;ted Mae&s;trich$, with|out oppo&s;ition, on the third day of April. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of Imperial and Dutch troops, under the conduct of the governor baron d'Aylva, who defended the place with extraordinary &s;kill and re&s;olution. He annoyed the be&s;iegers in repeated &s;allies; but they were determined to &s;urmount all oppo|&s;ition, and pro&s;ecuted their approaches with incredible ardour. They a&s;&s;aulted the covered-way, in which they effected a lodgment, after an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, in which they lo&s;t two thou&s;and of their be&s;t troops; but, next day they were intirely di&s;lodged by the gallantry of the garri&s;on The&s;e ho&s;tilities were &s;uddenly &s;u&s;pended, in con&s;equence of the preliminaries &s;igned at Aix-la-Chapelle. The plenipotentiaries agreed, that, for the glory of his chri&s;tian maje&s;ty's arms, the town of Mae&s;tricht &s;hould be &s;urrendered to his general, on condition that is
<PB N="698" REF="7010">
&s;hould be re&s;tored, with all the magazines and artillery. He accordingly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it on the third day of May, when the garri&s;on marched out with all the honours of war; and a ce&s;&s;ation of arms immediately en&s;ued. By this time the Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries, to the number of thirty-&s;even thou&s;and, com|manded by prince Repnin, had arrived in Moravia, where they were reviewed by their Imperial maje&s;ties; then they proceeded to the confines of Franconia, where they were ordered to halt, after they had marched &s;even hundred miles &s;ince the beginning of the year. The French king declared, that &s;hould they advance farther, he would demoli&s;h the fortifications of Mae&s;tricht and Bergen|op-zoom. This di&s;pute was referred to the plenipotentiaries, who, in the be|ginning of Augu&s;t, concluded a convention, importing, that the Ru&s;&s;ian troops &s;hould return to their own country; and that the French king &s;hould di&s;band an equal number of his forces. The &s;ea&s;on being far advanced, the Ru&s;&s;ians were provided with winter-quarters in Bohemia and Moravia, where they continued to the &s;pring, when they marched back to Livonia. In the mean time &s;even and thirty thou&s;and French troops were withdrawn from Flan|ders into Picardy, and the two armies remained quiet till the conclu&s;ion of the definitive treaty. The &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms was proclaimed at London, and in all the capitals of the contracting powers: orders were &s;ent to the re&s;pective admirals in different parts of the world, to refrain from ho&s;tilities; and a com|munication of trade and intelligence was again opened between the nations which had been at variance. No material tran&s;action di&s;tingui&s;hed the cam|paign in Italy. The French and Spani&s;h troops who had joined the Genoe&s;e in the territories of the republic, amounted to thirty thou&s;and men, under the direction of the duke de Richelieu, who was &s;ent from France to a&s;&s;ume that command, on the death of the duke de Boufflers; while marechal de Bellei&s;le, at the head of fifty thou&s;and men, covered the we&s;tern Riviera, which was threat|ened with an inva&s;ion by forty thou&s;and Au&s;trians and Piedmonte&s;e, under ge|neral Leutrum. At the &s;ame time general Brown, with a more numerous army, prepared to re-enter the ea&s;tern Riviera, and re-commence the &s;iege of Genoa. But the&s;e intended operations were prevented by an armi&s;tice, which took place as &s;oon as the belligerant powers had acceded to the preliminaries.</P>

<P>In the Ea&s;t-Indies, rear-admiral Bo&s;cawen undertook the &s;iege of Pondicherry, which, in the month of Augu&s;t, he blocked up by &s;ea with his &s;quadron, and inve&s;ted by land with a &s;mall army of four thou&s;and Europeans, and about two thou&s;and natives of that country. He pro&s;ecuted the enterprize with great &s;pirit, and took the fort of Area Coupan, at the di&s;tance of three miles from the town: then he made his approaches to the place, again&s;t which he opened batteries, while it was bombarded and cannonaded by the &s;hipping. But the $ortifications were &s;o &s;trong, the garri&s;on &s;o numerous, and the engi|neers of the enemy &s;o expert in their profe&s;&s;ion, that he made very little pro|gre&s;s, and &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage. At length, his army being dimini&s;hed by &s;ickne&s;s, and the rainy &s;ea&s;on approaching, he ordered the artillery and &s;tores to be reimbarked; and rai&s;ing the &s;iege on the &s;ixth day of October, returned to &s;ort St. David, after having lo&s;t about a thou&s;and men in this ex|pedition. In the &s;equel, &s;everal &s;hips of his &s;quadron, and above twelve hun|dred &s;ailors, peri&s;hed in a hurricane. The naval force of Great Britain was more &s;ucce&s;sful in the We&s;t-Indies. Rear-admiral Knowles, with a &s;quadron
<PB N="699" REF="7020">
of eight &s;hips, attacked fort Louis on the &s;outh &s;ide of Hi&s;paniola, which after a warm action of three hours was &s;urrendered on capitulation, and di&s;mantled. Then he made an abortive attempt upon St. Jago de Cuba, and returned to Jamaica, extremely chagrined at hi$ di&s;appointment, which he imputed to the mi&s;conduct of captain Dent, who was tried in England by a court-martial, and honourably acquitted. On the fir&s;t day of October, admiral Knowles crui&s;ing in the neighbourhood of the Havannah, with eight &s;hips of the line, encoun|tered a Spani&s;h &s;quadron of nearly the &s;ame &s;trength, under the command of the admirals Reggio and Spinola. The engagement began between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, and continued with intervals till eight in the evening, when the enemy retired to the Havannah, with the lo&s;s of two &s;hips; one of which &s;truck to the Engli&s;h admiral, and the other was, two days after, &s;et on fire by her own commander, that &s;he might not fall into the hands of the Engli&s;h. Mr. Knowles taxed &s;ome of his captains with mi&s;behaviour, and they recrimi|nated on his conduct. On their return to England, a court-martial was the con&s;equence of their mutual accu&s;ations. Tho&s;e who adhered to the comman|der, and the others whom he impeached, were inflamed again&s;t other with the mo&s;t rancorous re&s;entment. The admiral him&s;elf did not e&s;cape uncen&s;ured: two of his captains were reprimanded: but captain Holmes, who had di&s;played uncommon courage, was honourably acquitted. Their animo&s;ities did not end with the court-martial. A bloodle&s;s encounter happened between the admiral and captain Powlet: but captain Innes and captain Clarke, meeting by ap|pointment in Hyde-park wi$h pi&s;tols, the former was mortally wounded, and died next morning; the latter was tried, and condemned for murder, but in|dulged with his maje&s;ty's pardon. No naval tran&s;action of any con&s;equence happened in the European &s;eas, during the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer. In January indeed, the Magnanime, a French &s;hip of the line, was taken in the channel by two Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, after an ob&s;tinate engagement; and the privateers took a con&s;iderable number of merchant &s;hips from the enemy.</P>

<P>The plenipotentiaries &s;till continued at Aix-la-chapelle, di&s;cu&s;|&s;ing all the articles of the definitive treaty, which was at length concluded and &s;igned on the &s;eventh day of October. It was founded on former treaties, which were now expre&s;ly confirmed, from that of We&s;tphalia to the la&s;t concluded at London and Vienna. The contracting parties agreed, That all pri&s;oners on each &s;ide &s;hould be mutually relea&s;ed, without ran&s;om, and all conque&s;ts re|&s;tored: That the duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Gua&s;talla, &s;hould be ceded as a &s;ettlement to the infant Don Philip, and the heirs-male of his body; but in ca&s;e of his a&s;cending the throne of Spain, or of the two Sicilies, or his dying without male-i&s;&s;ue, that they &s;hould revert to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria: That the king of Great-Britain &s;hould, immediately after the ratification of this treaty, &s;end two per&s;ons of rank and di&s;tinction, to re&s;ide in France, as ho&s;tages, until re&s;titution &s;hould be made of Cape-Breton, and all the other conque&s;ts which his Britannic maje&s;ty &s;hould have atchieved in the Ea&s;t or We&s;t-Indies, before or after the preliminaries were &s;igned: That the a&s;&s;iento contract, with the ar|ticle of the annual &s;hip, &s;hould be confirmed for four years, during which the enjoyment of that privilege was &s;u&s;pended &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent war: That Dunkirk &s;hould remain fortified on the land-&s;ide, and towards the &s;ea continue on the footing of former treaties. All the con|tracting
<PB N="700" REF="7030">
powers became guaranties to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia for the duchy of Silefia and the county of Glatz, as he at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them; and they likewi&s;e engaged to &s;ecure the empre&s;s-queen of Hungary and Bohemia in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her hereditary dominions, according to the pragmatic &s;anction. The other articles regulated the forms and times fixed for this mutual re&s;titu|tion, as well as for the termination of ho&s;tilities in different parts of the world. But the right of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects to navigate in the American &s;eas, without being &s;ubject to &s;earch, was not once mentioned; though this claim was the original &s;ource of the differences between Great-Britain and Spain: nor were the limits of Acadia a&s;certained. This and all other di&s;putes were left to the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of commi&s;&s;aries. We have already ob&s;erved, that after the troubles of the empire began, the war was no longer maintained on Briti&s;h principles. It be|came a continental conte&s;t, and was pro&s;ecuted on the &s;ide of the allies, without conduct, &s;pirit, or unanimity. In the Netherlands they were outnumbered and outwitted by the enemy. They never hazarded a battle without &s;u&s;taining a defeat. Their va&s;t armies, payed by Great-Britain, lay inactive, and beheld one fortre&s;s reduced after another, until the whole country was &s;ubdued; and as their generals fought, their plenipotentiaries negotiated. At a time, when their affairs began to wear the mo&s;t promi&s;ing a&s;pect; when the arrival of the Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries would have &s;ecured an undoubted &s;uperiority in the field; when the Briti&s;h fleets had trampled on the naval power of France and Spain, intercepted their &s;upplies of trea&s;ure, and cut off all their re&s;ources of commerce; the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters &s;eemed to treat, without the lea&s;t regard to the honour and advantage of their country. They left her mo&s;t valuable and nece&s;&s;ary rights of trade unowned and undecided: they &s;ub&s;cribed to the in&s;olent demand of &s;ending the nobles of the realm to grace the court, and adorn the triumphs of her enemy: and they tamely gave up her conque&s;ts in North-America, of more con&s;equence to her traffic than all the other dominions for which the powers at war contended: they gave up the important i&s;le of Cape-Breton, in exchange for a petty factory in the Ea&s;t-Indies, belonging to a private com|pany, who&s;e exi&s;tence has been deemed prejudicial to the commonwealth. What then were the fruits which Britain reaped from this long and de&s;perate war? A dreadful expence of blood and trea&s;ure, di&s;grace upon di&s;grace, an additional load of grievous impo&s;itions, and the national debt accumulated to the enor|mous &s;um of eighty millions &s;terling.</P>
