<P>THE crime of Rape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII.</NOTE> like that of Murder, is one of the
Four Pleas of the Crown, and is ju&s;tly cla&s;&s;ed with it
in many of our &s;tatutes, as one of the mo&s;t grievous injuries
that an individual can &s;u&s;tain: being a robbery of that
wherein a woman's honour, her place in &s;ociety, and her
e&s;timation in her own eyes, depend; and being al&s;o, in
the perpetration of it, nece&s;&s;arily accompanied with great
alarm and terror, and with actual violence to the per|&s;on.</P>
<P>Two controver&s;ies have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the commenta|tors
on the Roman law,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Crimen Raptus,</HI> what it was in the Roman law.</NOTE> touching the doctrine of that &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="2" REF="3">
with re&s;pect to this offence. According to &s;ome<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This is the opinion of Mathaeus, Perezius, and of Carp&s;ovius.</NOTE>, who at
lea&s;t allege very plau&s;ible, though perhaps not conclu&s;ive
rea&s;ons for their opinion, the <HI>crimen raptus</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in the
forcible abduction of the woman's per&s;on, and was a com|plete
and capital crime, though violation did not en&s;ue.
And farther, which is not very &s;uitable in it&s;elf, and would
need to be confirmed by fuller authorities than any that are
quoted for it, the violation, without abduction of her per&s;on,
was not only a different crime, di&s;tingu&s;hed by the name of
<HI>&s;tuprum violentum,</HI> but was only puni&s;hable, in any ca&s;e, with
the pain of deportation<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See the&s;e que&s;tions di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in Carp&s;ovins, Corn. in Dig. lib. 48. tit. 4.

<HI>&s;eparat$m</HI> capital.</NOTE></P>
<P>HOWEVER the&s;e things might be in the Roman law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What it is in the Scots law.</NOTE> cer|tain
it is, that the cu&s;tom of Scotland, which in this is
equally agreeable to rea&s;on and to the practice of the re&s;t
of Europe, does not li&s;ten to any &s;uch di&s;tinction, and holds
the crime of rape to be complete, without any abduction, by
the unlawful carnal knowledge of the woman's per&s;on, for|cibly,
and again&s;t her will. If there were need of authori|ties
on this head, reference might be made to the ca&s;e of
Captain Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 8. &amp; 22. 1697.</NOTE> and to that of Wallace and Ferres; in both
of which this alleged doctrine of the Roman law was urged,
and was di&s;regarded.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 23. and Mar. 2. 1747.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penetration and Emi&s;&s;ion, if ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</NOTE> therefore, are the facts which are nece&s;&s;ary to be

nece&s;&s;ary; or whether a di&s;tinction is to be admitted in this
article between women of mature age, and tho&s;e under the
years of puberty, (which &s;eems to be the opinion of Carp&s;ovius
and Mathaeus), is a que&s;tion which I &s;hall rather leave to be
decided on the terms of certain convictions which appear in
the record, than endeavour to &s;ettle by offering any remarks
of my own.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 2. &amp; 9. 1642.</NOTE> Alexander Gylour, &startq;&s;ervant in the Ba&s;s, and
&startq;clymer of the craig thereof,&endq; is indicted for the filthy
crime of forcing, violent abu&s;ing, and deflouring of Janet
Bou&s;&s;ie; and the a&s;&s;ize convict him &startq;of the violent and
&s;chameful forceing of the &s;aid Janet Bou&s;&s;ie, ane young vir|gine,

hir in hir &s;ecret partis, to the effu&s;ione of hir blood in
great quantitie; with this declaratione, that they could
not find nor affirme, that ye &s;aid Alexander Gylour had &s;ic|carnall
copulatione with the &s;aid young la&s;&s;e, as ane man
has with ane woman, in re&s;pect of her young yearis and
minoritie above writtin.&endq; On which verdict he has &s;en|tence
to be &s;courged, and to be delivered to an officer on fo|reign
&s;ervice, who &s;hall carry him abroad, to &s;erve as a &s;oldier
in the foreign wars. This &s;entence is not given till after
con&s;ultation with the Privy Council, and is milder than that
which follows in other three ca&s;es, where the facts &s;et forth
in the dittay and verdict do not &s;eem to be materially different.
On the 3d of July 1605, William Bell has &s;entence of death
for the forcing and abu&s;ing of Janet Falconar, &startq;&s;cho being
ane young maid of twelf yeiris of age or y^r^b^y, and ryveing
of hir thairthro'w, and cau&s;ing hir to bleid at hir previe
membiris in greit abundance.&endq; On the 30th December
1608, John Errol has &s;entence of death for ravi&s;hing &startq;Janet
Craig, dochter of umquhil Andrew Craig, merchand-bur|ge&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="5">
of Edinburgh, ane honi&s;t manis bairne, and ane young
virgine nocht pa&s;t the age of elivin yeiris.&endq; The libel
relates the pannel's various attempts to decoy the infant
to his purpo&s;e, by means of allurements &s;uited to her age;
and that at length he carried her (&s;he having pa&s;&s;ed with
him &startq;upon bairnelines and meire &s;implicitie&endq;), to a con|venient
place, &startq;quair ye, againis the bairne's will, tuik

ado with hir, and wald nocht part from hir, quill ye gat
your bei&s;tlie will &s;atisfyit, and was within hir body.&endq;
Henry Speedy has the like doom, (20th February 1639),
on a charge of the &startq;filthie, dete&s;tabill and abominabill
cryme of forceing, defloreing and abu&s;eing of Agnes
Stewart, ane young virgine, and infant bairne of &s;ex yeir
auld,&endq; and this &startq;be ryveing hir &s;ecreit pairtis in mai&s;t
pitifull maner, to the effu&s;ioun of hir bluid, and greit
dainger of hir lyfe.&endq;<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">There was a report of &s;urgeons in this ca&s;e, which, after relating the condi|tion
of the child's per&s;on, concludes thus, <HI>&startq;Et haec cen&s;emus e&s;&s;e vera indicin lae|&s;ae virg$nitatis.&endq;</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>2. THE knowledge of the woman's per&s;on mu&s;t be again&s;t
her will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carnal Know|ledge mu&s;t be Forcible.</NOTE> and by force. So that though &s;he be carried off by
violence at fir&s;t, and even be detained in &s;ome mea&s;ure in a
&s;tate of confinement and con&s;traint; yet, if in the end, be|ing
weakened-in mind, and &s;haken with continual &s;olicitation
and other means, &s;he &s;ubmit to the embraces of her compa|nion
without any u&s;e of threats or violence, either at the
time, or recently before; this is not a rape, but a crime of
a different, though perhaps &s;till more ba&s;e and infamous de|&s;cription.
The re&s;i&s;tance, therefore, mu&s;t be continued to
<PB N="5" REF="6">
the la&s;t; &s;o that it is only by main force and terror that the
violation is accompli&s;hed. Probably it was on this ground
that the jury acquitted of that part of the charge in the
ca&s;e of James Macgregor;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 60.</NOTE> while they found him guilty of
the hame&s;ucken and forcible abduction.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine mu&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is held forcible Know|ledge.</NOTE> however, always be under&s;tood in a
rea&s;onable and con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e. For it is no le&s;s obvious, that
it is no con&s;ent, to take away the guilt of rape, if the woman
only di&s;continue her re&s;i&s;tance out of fear of death, as when
a pi&s;tol is clapped to her head, or a dagger to her brea&s;t; or
if &s;he be threatened with de&s;truction, and be beaten and
abu&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, as to alarm her for the &s;afety of
her life. There is the &s;ame rea&s;on for holding this to be
a rape, that there is for holding it to be a robbery, if a
per&s;on, on the like demand, &s;ubmits to have his money ta|ken
out of his pocket, or even with his own hands deli|vers
it<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The libel again&s;t William and Alexander Fra&s;ers, for forcible abduction and
rape, related, that the pannels carried Jean Fia&s;er out of her hou&s;e in Inverne&s;s
into the county called Stratherick, &startq;where &s;he was detained in captivity for
&s;everal days and nights, and carried from place to place, and thereby, <HI>and by
the terror of her life compelled</HI> to &s;ubmit to the &s;aid William Fra&s;er his unlaw|ful
purpo&s;es.&endq; This libel was found relevant to infer the pains of law. The
diet was afterwards de&s;erted. November 14. and 23. 1744&punc;</NOTE> Or what if the woman faint in the &s;truggle
through terror and fatigue, and is in that &s;tate carnally
known; or if from natural infirmity &s;he is unable to oppo&s;e,
otherwi&s;e than by her intreaties, and her cries for a&s;&s;i&s;tance?
In either ca&s;e the deed is accompli&s;hed by violence, &s;ince
all the re&s;i&s;tance is made that nature will allow. This is
exemplified in the ca&s;e of James Mackie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 20. 1650.</NOTE> who was con|demned
to die &startq;for the &s;hameful deflouring, forcing and
<PB N="6" REF="7">
abu&s;ing of Margaret Coltran in We&s;ter Wamphray, a poor
cripple lame la&s;s of &s;ixteen years old, lying bedfa&s;t in her
father's hou&s;e, and unable to make any re&s;i&s;tance,&endq; he
having entered the hou&s;e on a Sunday, at a time when &s;he
was there alone.</P>
<P>IT may be thought,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is held forcible know|ledge.</NOTE> that the &s;ame judgment &s;hall even be
applied to the ca&s;e of her who has been overpowered and
&s;tupified, or laid a&s;leep, by the foul contrivance of drugs or
potions admini&s;tered to her, and is abu&s;ed in this &s;tate of
in&s;en&s;ibility. For this is as great a violence to her per&s;on
and con&s;titution, as if &s;he were bound with cords, or &s;tun|ned
with blows before the fact, or were in any other ma|&s;terful
way di&s;abled to re&s;i&s;t. The preci&s;e ca&s;e has not in|deed
been tried; though there is a noted one which comes
near it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 21. 1721.</NOTE> the ca&s;e of Campbel of Burnbank, which is el&s;e|where
taken notice of<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Fal&s;ehood, p. 245.</NOTE>, and may be &s;eeen at large in the
appendix to Maclaurin's Ca&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 738.</NOTE> But the woman in that in|&s;tance
was dead before the trial; and the libel did not
affirm that her per&s;on had been violated<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">&startq;And &s;howed them the &s;aid Margaret Hall in her naked bed, and a man
with her, not her hu&s;band, who villainou&s;ly in their &s;ight either was de|bauching
her, or endeavouring to per&s;uade them he was doing &s;o, by the
po&s;ture he was in and the motions he made.&endq;</NOTE> (as neither had
&s;he her&s;elf affirmed it in her lifetime), but only that either
it was &s;o, <HI>or</HI> &s;o was made to appear to the bye&s;tanders.
The charge could not therefore be found relevant, as for
the proper pains of rape.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
THE quality of forcible knowledge, as now explained, is
farther to be under&s;tood as only nece&s;&s;ary in the ca&s;e of
per&s;ons adult.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is Force nece&s;|&s;ary in the vio|lation of Pupils?</NOTE> In the ca&s;e of infants, and females under
the years of puberty, there is only a con&s;tructive force, or
force in the e&s;timation of law; which is taken upon this rea|&s;onable
ground, that becau&s;e of her &s;implicity, and defect,
as well of intelligence and di&s;cretion, as of pa&s;&s;ion, the fe|male,
at tho&s;e years, is incapable of a due con&s;ent to this
act, and cannot, in any proper &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to have a will
in the matter; &s;o that the deed may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to be
without her will, even where &s;he makes no re&s;i&s;tance. On
that account, and as the wickedne&s;s of the offender is even
greater in this depraved abu&s;e of an ignorant child; &s;o, both
the &s;tyle of the crime, and the pains of law, have always
been the &s;ame for it, as in the ca&s;e of force employed again&s;t
a woman of mature di&s;cretion. Four in&s;tances of capital
conviction in this &s;ort have already been mentioned: and
to the&s;e may be added two more;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 8. 1693.</NOTE> the ca&s;e of William Currie,
for rape committed on Elizabeth Guthrie, a child of nine
years old; and the ca&s;e of William Riply, convicted at In|verne&s;s,
of a rape on Elizabeth Grin&s;al,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 11. 1761.</NOTE> a child under &s;ix
years of age. This ca&s;e was reported by the Judge upon
the circuit, for the opinion of all his brethren; who, on deli|berate
con&s;ideration, &startq;found, that the crime of which the
fore&s;aid William Riply &s;tands convicted is capital,&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 23. &amp; 27. 1761.</NOTE> and
adjudged him to be executed accordingly.</P>
<P>3. As the crime of rape is thus independent of the age of
the female,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Can Rape be done on a Pro&s;ti|tute?</NOTE> &s;o is it al&s;o independent of her &s;ituation, be &s;he
maid, wife, or widow, and even of her character and way of
life, though it were that of a &s;trumpet, &startq;<HI>quae pa&s;&s;im formam
venalem exhibuit.</HI>&endq; Any other opinion, can only proceed
<PB N="8" REF="9">
on the notion of &s;u&s;taining this cour&s;e of life as an irrefra|gable
pre&s;umption in law, that the act was not done again&s;t
her will. And certainly it is <HI>prima facie</HI> an evidence of
a&s;&s;ent in any ca&s;e, that the woman is one of this condition;
and it will require to be overcome by very clear proof, on
her part, of her violent and continued re&s;i&s;tance of the at|tempt.
But if once the full evidence be obtained, that
the woman was truly known by main force, &startq;<HI>vi compre&s;&s;a
contra pacem domini regis;&endq;</HI> as for in&s;tance, if &s;he be at
once knocked down on the highway by a per&s;on who knows
her not, and is abu&s;ed in that &s;tate of &s;tupefaction; this is a
good ground of the charge of rape. For the per&s;on of this
woman, as much as that of any other of the King's &s;ubjects,
is under the &s;afeguard of the law, if &s;he &s;hall choo&s;e to aban|don
her vicious cour&s;e of life; and the order and protection
of &s;ociety are equally broken in this a&s;&s;ault on her, as on any
of the more de&s;erving members of the community. It is true,
the degree of the injury is affected by the circum&s;tance of
her previous evil life; and &s;o it is if the &s;ufferer have ever
in any in&s;tance been uncha&s;te, or of &s;u&s;pected fame; as it
may likewi&s;e be by other con&s;iderations of a quite different
kind. But, in di&s;regarding this difference, the law does
no more than ob&s;erve its ordinary rule, as in the ca&s;e of
other offences. For, in fixing the character of any crime,
and deciding whether it has been committed, the con|&s;tant
cour&s;e is to attend to the act it&s;elf, and never to the
per&s;on; to con&s;ider the immediate and fundamental thing
that has been done,&mdash;the violation of order, peace, or &s;ecuri|ty,&mdash;and
to pay no regard to the merits of the &s;ufferer, nor
attempt to trace the preci&s;e degree of evil which follows it
in the particular ca&s;e. Thus, it is <HI>robbery</HI> to take a penny
from any one by force, whether the per&s;on be a rich man or a
<PB N="9" REF="10">
beggar. It is <HI>murder</HI> wherever a man is killed, without
re&s;pect of the condition of the decea&s;ed, whether he were
a &s;ane per&s;on or an idiot, in health or on deathbed, an u&s;e|ful
citizen or a criminal. And ju&s;t &s;o it is a rape, to know
a woman carnally by force, of what condition or quality
&s;oever &s;he be. If it is not the &s;ame high injury to the pro|&s;titute,
as to the woman of virtuous deportment, it is for the
royal mercy to con&s;ider this circum&s;tance, and to remit or
to mitigate the puni&s;hment: It is not for the Judge to di&s;tin|gui&s;h,
as if the woman had not been forced, nor a rape been
committed. In addition to the&s;e rea&s;ons, though in them|&s;elves
conclu&s;ive:&mdash;any other doctrine would lead to farther,
and very injurious inquiries and di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>4. MACKENZIE has added to his definition of this crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t the Rape be for Lu&s;t only?</NOTE>
that it is done for &s;atisfying of the ravi&s;her's lu&s;t; and he &s;ays
that it is not a rape if &s;he be taken away on any other ac|count.
But this &s;eems to be &s;omewhat ra&s;hly &s;aid. It is
not as a lu&s;tful, but as a malicious and injurious act; that
rape is the object of the &s;everity of the law. And the
woman &s;uffers the &s;ame injury, what&s;oever be the ulti|mate
end or chief incitement to the crime; whether pure
lu&s;t, (which is always thus far involved in the ca&s;e, that
the rape cannot otherwi&s;e be perpetrated), or combined
with this, the motive of avarice, revenge, or other malig|nant
pa&s;&s;ion; in which ca&s;e the outrage &s;eems only to be the
more odious and inexcu&s;able. Of this character, and certainly
the fit ground of a charge of rape, was the ca&s;e of Simon
Fra&s;er of Beaufort, (afterwards Lord Lovat), who, partly
out of revenge for his di&s;appoinment of his projected mar|riage
with a certain heire&s;s, and partly to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of
a valuable jointure, committed a forcible abduction, mar|riage,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
and rape, on the per&s;on of the lady's mother, the
Dowager Lady Lovat, who had oppo&s;ed his &s;uit. On ac|count
of the ri&s;ing in arms, with which this outrage was
accompanied, Fra&s;er and his a&s;&s;ociates were, in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance,
tried in ab&s;ence, as for trea&s;on. But having obtain|ed
a pardon for that crime, he was afterwards, on the
17th February 1701, outlawed on a libel for rape and hame|&s;ucken,
at the in&s;tance of Lady Lovat. In the ca&s;e, in like
manner, of Campbell of Burnbank, if it could have been
&s;hown that the woman was actually violated, the fact would
not the le&s;s have been a rape, in the violator and his a&s;&s;o|ciates,
that it was only part of a con&s;piracy to ruin her
fame, and divorce her from her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>AND this brings me to remark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of Rape.</NOTE> that there is equally room
for conviction as art and part on a charge of rape, as of
tho&s;e crimes in which the principal matter it&s;elf may be the
deed of more than one per&s;on. Tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;t in the ab|duction,
binding, or &s;ubduing of the per&s;on, or even by pre|&s;ence
or approbation of the deed, are all involved in the
&s;ame guilt as the ravi&s;her. This will even hold without
exception of the hu&s;band of the woman; who, though he
cannot him&s;elf commit a rape on his own wife, who has
&s;urrendered her per&s;on to him in that &s;ort, may however be
acce&s;&s;ory to that crime, (if one may &s;uppo&s;e &s;o flagitious a
ca&s;e), committed on her by another. In the &s;pring circuit
1794, at Aberdeen, three per&s;ons were condemned as art and
part of one act of rape.</P>
<P>5. THE puni&s;hment of rape is death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of law for Rape.</NOTE> by immemorial cu&s;|tom.
Be&s;ide other in&s;tances of this &s;everity which have
<PB N="11" REF="12">
already been mentioned; Wallace and Ferres had &s;entence
of death for rape, 3d March 1747, and Duncan Wright,
11th January 1790.</P>
<P>IN one &s;ituation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If the Woman acquie&s;ce.</NOTE> the offender's life may however be &s;a|ved,
in virtue of the &s;tatute 1612, c. 4.; which a&s;&s;umes and
implies, (for it does not enact any &s;uch thing), that in ca&s;e
the woman &s;hall acquie&s;ce in her condition, and declare,
though contrary to the truth, that &s;he went off with the pan|nel
of her own free will, he &s;hall not be condemned to die;
&s;aving to her kinsfolks to in&s;i&s;t again&s;t him for arbitrary
puni&s;hment, to the extent of fine, impri&s;onment, or e&s;cheat of
moveables. It may be inferred from the &s;tyle of the &s;tatute,
that according to the previous practice, the woman's decla|ration
of her con&s;ent had been reckoned a complete pro|tection
to the ravi&s;her; and indeed there are two in&s;tances
in the record, recently before the date of the &s;tatute, where,
by appearing in Court and te&s;tifying in his favour, the wo|man
had di&s;appointed the cour&s;e of public ju&s;tice. In the
ca&s;e of James Herrin, tried on the 29th June 1590, for a
rape on Agnes Blair, &s;he compears and &s;ays, &startq;That &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed away with him willingly,&endq; on which he is &s;traight|way
acquitted by the a&s;&s;ize. In the trial of Andrew Dow|nie,
on the 12th January 1590, for the ravi&s;hing of E&s;&s;ie

any provi&s;ion being made to enforce his appearance, in
ca&s;e of his being again called on. To hinder the encourage|ment,
which in this cour&s;e was given to &s;uch attempts,
and at the &s;ame time to reconcile that object with com|pa&s;&s;ion
to the woman, who&s;e pro&s;pect of an advantageous
e&s;tabli&s;hment in life is le&s;&s;ened by &s;uch a misfortune, was
probably the motive of this enactment. And, that in truth
there was at that period &s;ome need of applying a remedy
to this abu&s;e, not only appears from the proceedings alrea|dy
mentioned, but from a letter addre&s;&s;ed by James VI. to
Parliament in 1609, wherein he complains of the frequency
of &s;uch outrages of late years, and, among other means of
repre&s;&s;ing them, advi&s;es to pa&s;s an act puni&s;hing the mere
abduction with death, and declaring that the woman's ac|quie&s;cence
after the deed &s;hall not aboli&s;h the guilt of rape.
The fruit of this letter was a Parliamentary commi&s;&s;ion in
1609, concerning the ravi&s;hing of women<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See the Index to the unprinted acts of 1609, No. 44.</NOTE>, and the above &s;ta|tute
of 1612. To &s;erve the purpo&s;e of &s;aving the pan|nel's
life, the woman's declaration in his favour mu&s;t how|ever
be given in a &s;tate of entire freedom, &s;uch as not
only protects her from all immediate con&s;traint, but al&s;o
from all fear of con&s;equences for the future. The ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of this precaution appeared in the proceedings for the
abduction of Jean Key,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Machurin, No. 60.</NOTE> who being put under the protection
of a per&s;on appointed by the Court, &s;oon recalled the re|peated
declarations, which &s;he had previou&s;ly given in fa|vour
of the offender, in a written, and even a judicial form.
If made freely, her te&s;timony &s;eems, however, by the words
of the act, to be effectual to the ravi&s;her, though &s;he &s;hould
not continue to cohabit with and adhere to him, as her hu&s;|band.</P>

This ca&s;e i&s;&s;ued in a volun|tary bani&s;hment. John Errol had been indicted for rape, at in&s;tance of the Ad|vocate only, as far back as the 30th December 1608.</NOTE>

rea&s;on of the nece&s;&s;ity of the woman's te&s;timony as a wit|ne&s;s,
or of the peculiar nature of the offence, which &s;he

the hu&s;band may pur&s;ue for rape committed on his wife, as

Caruegie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 20. 1681.</NOTE> a father-in-law pur&s;ued in name of the woman,
and her mother, and for him&s;elf; to which no objection

<P>8. WHERE the pro&s;ecution is not at in&s;tance of the wo|man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Party injured is a competent Witne&s;s.</NOTE>
her evidence upon oath, or, if &s;he be under the due
age for making oath, her declaration, is admitted in the
trial; as being in the common ca&s;e a nece&s;&s;ary te&s;timo|ny,
without which a conviction cannot be obtained. On
the other hand; as the accu&s;ation of &s;o &s;ecret an offence

by direct evidence; &s;o the credit to be given her te&s;ti|mony
mu&s;t depend on the probability of her &s;tory, (all cir|cum&s;tances
con&s;idered), and the concurrent evidence which
&s;upports it. In the ca&s;e of Matthew Foulden, the jury con|victed
only of an a&s;&s;ault with intent to ravi&s;h, though the
woman po&s;itively &s;wore to the completion of a rape. And
Charles Fallon, notwith&s;tanding evidence to the &s;ame effect,
but attended with &s;everal unlikely circum&s;tances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 10. 1775.</NOTE> was fully

a doubt, is a point of dittay for which he is liable to be
puni&s;hed, not only with fine and damages, but with corpo|ral
and infamous pains: Both on account of the high alarm
and terror which accompany an a&s;&s;ault in that &s;ort, and
<PB N="16" REF="17">
becau&s;e of the pre&s;ent injury and indignity of &s;uch an at|tempt
on the per&s;on of a mode&s;t woman. In the ca&s;e of
James Gray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 9. and Nov. 22. 1703.</NOTE> libel was found relevant to infer an arbitra|ry
pain, which bore a charge, that &startq;mo&s;t unnaturally and
villanou&s;ly he did abu&s;e the body of the &s;aid I&s;obel
Cleugh, (a poor child, &s;ix years of age), by lying above
her, and offering to lie, or actually lying carnally with

<P>III. THE practice of Scotland is attentive to guard the
honour of the female &s;ex,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corruption of the Morals of Female Pupils.</NOTE> not only again&s;t tho&s;e forcible at|tempts,
which may be made upon them in their mature age,
but al&s;o again&s;t tho&s;e &s;till more infamous and abominable
practices, and which it were a violation of decency to de|&s;cribe,
which may be made to corrupt and vitiate their
minds, in their earlier years, before they have attained to
&s;ufficient intelligence or di&s;cretion, for their own defence
again&s;t &s;uch &s;eduction. The libel again&s;t James Forbes,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
ma&s;ter of a charity-&s;chool, bore a charge of practices of this
nature, as well as of rape, and carnal knowledge of girls
under twelve years of age. On the 24th July 1758, the
Court found &startq;the &s;aid indictment, and <HI>different articles thereof
jointly and &s;everally relevant,</HI> to infer the pains of law;&endq; and
being found guilty, he was ordered to be &s;courged, and to
be tran&s;ported for life. On a libel, bearing accu&s;ation of
the like indecencies again&s;t John Bell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 2. 1777.</NOTE> &s;choolma&s;ter at
Stewarton, the diet was de&s;erted in re&s;pect of an inaccu|racy
in the charge; but the Court thought it proper, never|thele&s;s,
to record their opinion of the dittay, as &startq;contain|ing
matter highly criminal, and dangerous to &s;ociety, and
relevant to infer the pains of law.&endq; On the 15th Augu&s;t
1789, William Wood was outlawed on a charge of the &s;ame
kind.</P>
<P>IV. THE only other offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of forcible Ali|duction and Marriage.</NOTE> which peculiarly concerns
the female part of the inhabitants of Scotland, is that of
forcible abduction and marriage. This, as already &s;aid,
is alleged to have been the proper <HI>crimen raptus</HI> of the Ro|man
law, and to have been puni&s;hed with death, even though
it were not attended with violation of the woman's per|&s;on.
There is not, perhaps, the full mea&s;ure of authority
for this opinion; though truly, if we con&s;ider the alarm and
terror of &s;uch an attack on the per&s;on of a woman, and
the de&s;olation and mi&s;ery of a &s;tate of continued captivi|ty
in the hands of ruffians, (not to mention the humilia|tion
and lo&s;s of peace which attend &s;uch a misfortune), it
may well &s;eem that lower injuries, and &s;uch as do not imply
the &s;ame height of boldne&s;s and profligacy in the offender,
are, by the laws of mo&s;t nations, puni&s;hed with death. It
<PB N="18" REF="19">
cannot however be a&s;&s;irmed of the ancient cu&s;tom of Scotland,
that it had adopted this opinion; whether the rea&s;on be that
&s;uch attempts were rare, or that the abduction was ordinarily
accompanied with rape, which could not be the le&s;s criminal,
that it took place under the pretence of marriage. The only
charge of &s;uch a crime which I have found in the older re|cords,
is that again&s;t Patrick Carnegie, &s;on to Lord Northe&s;k,
for abduction of Mary Gray, the heire&s;s of Baledgarno; which,
according to the &s;tory related in the libel, was attended with
circum&s;tances of great violence and ferocity. But, after many
continuations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 21. 1681.</NOTE> the diet was in the end de&s;erted; owing to a
pardon obtained from the King, as far as the public intere&s;t
was concerned. Hence, when the que&s;tion came to be
agitated more lately, in the trial of Thomas Gray and
others, in 1751, for the forcible abduction and marriage of
Jacobina Moir, an heire&s;s of fifteen years of age, it was
reckoned in a manner a new que&s;tion, and was the &s;ubject of
a full argument at the bar. The re&s;ult was, that the libel was
found only relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment; and
that Gray and his two accomplices were adjudged to be
tran&s;ported for fourteen years.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 59.</NOTE> It is true, that the abduc|tion
in that ca&s;e was neither to a great di&s;tance, nor for a
length of time; as well as that the enterpri&s;e was conducted
by means of artifice and fraud, rather than by main force. It
is al&s;o true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 62.</NOTE> that in the later ca&s;e of Robert Macgregor, con|victed
as art and part of the abduction of Jean Key, ca|pital
&s;entence was pronounced, and carried into execution.
But this judgment was given on the &s;pecial and aggravated
ground of the abduction being coupled to hame&s;ucken, by
inva&s;ion of the woman in her own hou&s;e, and the forcible car|rying
of her per&s;on thence. James Macgregor, the bro|ther
<PB N="19" REF="20">
of this Robert, and principal actor in this atroci|ous
injury, had al&s;o been previou&s;ly convicted by a ver|dict,
upon which a debate en&s;ued, whether it amounted to
a conviction of hame&s;ucken;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 60.</NOTE> but he withdrew him&s;elf
from the ri&s;k, and prevented the deci&s;ion, by making his
e&s;cape from goal.</P>

concerning it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 4. ch. 9. 10.</NOTE> is in the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem,</HI> which di|rects

far exceeds the guilt of an ordinary a&s;&s;ault, and is a crime
of that bold and heinous character, which makes it a fit
companion of tho&s;e high tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. For nothing can
well be attended with greater terror and alarm, or more
break in upon a per&s;on's peace, and opinion of &s;ecurity
for the future, than the &s;udden irruption and attack of a
ruffian in that place which is mo&s;t peculiarly a man's own,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
and which the law has carefully fenced for him, as his
&s;anctuary and &s;ure&s;t refuge, from all manner of harm. It is
true, it may not be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary now, as in more undi&s;ci|plined
times, to puni&s;h the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in every in&s;tance
to the utmo&s;t extent of what the pro&s;ecutor may in&s;i&s;t for;
yet &s;till the crime retains that rank as a point of dittay,
which ancient cu&s;tom has a&s;&s;igned it, (for it re&s;ts on cu&s;tom
only), and in any ca&s;e of extreme or atrocious injury, would
be warrantably puni&s;hed with the highe&s;t pains of law.</P>
<P>1. THE prime circum&s;tance in the de&s;cription of hame|&s;ucken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion mu&s;t be in a Dwell|ing-hou&s;e.</NOTE>
is the violation of the &s;ecurity of a per&s;on's home.
And herein we exclude every place of reception, or accom|modation,
though belonging to a man in property, if it is
not, in the common &s;en&s;e of the word, a man&s;ion-hou&s;e, or
place of habitation. Hame&s;ucken cannot therefore be com|mitted
in a booth, &s;hop, or warehou&s;e; as was determined
in the ca&s;e of John Kirkwoood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 11. &amp; 12. 1678.</NOTE> indicted for entering the
&s;hop of his neighbour Janet Rankine, and violently beat|ing
her there. After debate, the pro&s;ecutor declared,
that he did not in&s;i&s;t on the hame&s;ucken as &s;uch, to the in|ferring
of death, but as an aggravation only of the a&s;&s;ault.
The Court, however, would not accept of this conce&s;&s;ion,
and thought it proper expre&s;sly to decide the que&s;tion<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;The Lords, &amp;c. &s;u&s;tain the libel to infer a riot, but refu&s;e to &s;u&s;tain the &s;ame to infer hame&s;ucken; and find the pannels entering the pur&s;uer's booth an aggravating circum&s;tance; and remits,&endq; &amp;c.</NOTE>;

(as the record calls it), and there beating him
with a baton, and thru&s;ting at him with a &s;word, during

charge as for hame&s;ucken<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It is not ab&s;olutely clear, on the terms of the libel, whether it was meant as a charge of hame&s;ucken, or only of a&s;&s;ault aggravated by being done in the way of hame&s;ucken; which at that time was a common way of re&s;tricting the charge.</NOTE>, but &startq;relevant to be ane crime,

only to a&s;k the pur&s;uer's pardon, and find caution to keep the
peace: &s;uch was the e&s;timation of a comedian in tho&s;e days.
According to the &s;ame principle which ruled in the&s;e ca&s;es;
if a miller is a&s;&s;aulted in his mill, a cobler in his &s;tall or
place of work, a banker in his counting-hou&s;e, a clerk of
court or other officer in his office, this is not hame&s;ucken,
but a heinous a&s;&s;ault only. The rea&s;on lies in the nature
and de&s;tination of the place, which is not a place of pri|vacy
and retirement, where the occupier mu&s;t deem him|&s;elf
&s;ecure again&s;t the projects of his enemies, but in &s;ome
mea&s;ure a place of open re&s;ort and free acce&s;s to all comers,
where any one has opportunity to find and invade him. In
which point of view, it may &s;eem that no di&s;tinction can
well be made in this matter, at lea&s;t with re&s;pect to a&s;&s;aults
committed in the day-time, whether the &s;hop be or be not
a part of or adjoining to the per&s;on's dwelling-hou&s;e: be|cau&s;e
the &s;hop is open to all the world, and ought, there|fore,

<P><PB N="23" REF="24">
IT does not, however, make hame&s;ucken, that the a&s;&s;ault
is committed in a man&s;ion-hou&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Per&s;on mu&s;t be a&s;&s;aulted at his Home.</NOTE> unle&s;s it al&s;o be the par|ty's

According to Mackenzie, this point was &s;ettled in the negative,
in the ca&s;e of Muir of Pennyglen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 8. 1675.</NOTE> but in this he has mi&s;taken

In it&s;elf, the que&s;tion &s;eems fit to be re|&s;olved
by certain di&s;tinctions. If a gue&s;t or lodger, being in
an inn, &s;hould quarrel with the landlord and beat him; this,
though it were even done deliberately, and in the landlord's
private room, is not hame&s;ucken; becau&s;e the offender
is already lawfully in the hou&s;e, and has not gone to &s;eek
the landlord there, to beat him. Farther; if per&s;ons are
in an inn drinking, and &s;et upon the innkeeper in &s;o &s;udden
and unprovoked a manner as &s;hows that they truly came
there for no other purpo&s;e; it may &s;eem that &s;till they
are not guilty of hame&s;ucken, (though certainly they are
guilty of an aggravated a&s;&s;ault), by rea&s;on of the nature
of his trade and &s;ort of hou&s;e; which is not &s;hut, like
a private hou&s;e, again&s;t all but per&s;ons known to the

and cannot be tru&s;ted to as &startq;<HI>tuti&s;&s;imum refugium et
receptaculum.</HI>&endq; The truth is, that with re&s;pect to any per|&s;on
whom he has admitted into the inn, the ma&s;ter does
not tru&s;t to the protection of the hou&s;e, but to the faith of
the individual. The libel is therefore laid as for an aggra|vated
riot only and a&s;&s;ault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 8. &amp; 15. 1726.</NOTE> in the ca&s;e of John Torrence and
William Baillie, which is of this preci&s;e de&s;cription; be|ing
the inva&s;ion of a publican, by per&s;ons who came to his
hou&s;e armed, late in the night, and joined and drank with a
party who were previou&s;ly in the hou&s;e, and on the depar|ture
of tho&s;e &s;trangers, called the ma&s;ter into another room,
where they in&s;tantly invaded and beat him. Indeed the pur|&s;uer,
in his information, yields the general point, that to
invade a publican, <HI>being already in his hou&s;e,</HI> will not ju&s;tify
any higher charge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;And as to the &s;econd, it was admitted, that hame&s;ucken was not proper|ly committed in a public-hou&s;e; and therefore hame&s;ucken was not libelled as the &s;pecific crime. But then as an inn-keeper was entitled to &s;ecurity in his own hou&s;e, and as an inva&s;ion by the gue&s;ts upon their landlord, was a breach of the laws of ho&s;pitality; &s;o it was a great aggravation of the crime, and it was libelled as &s;uch.&endq; <HI>Pur&s;uer's information.</HI></NOTE> But there &s;eems to be much greater
difficulty of going farther, and admitting the exception

entry, his hou&s;e &s;eems to be ju&s;t the &s;ame &s;afeguard to him,
as in the ca&s;e of any other man. Accordingly, the petition

UPON this article, of the <HI>place where</HI> hame&s;ucken may be
committed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are the Pre|cincts Part of the Hou&s;e?</NOTE> there ari&s;es a que&s;tion concerning the con&s;truction

or takes in al&s;o the precincts, or adjoining appendages
of building which are within the inclo&s;ure of the court|yard.
Mackenzie inclines to the more enlarged con&s;truction:
Skene too,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 4. c. 9.</NOTE> in his note on the <HI>Regiam,</HI> &s;ays, &startq;<HI>Punitur enim hac

in confirmation of this opinion, that by the ordinary
&s;tyle of libel for hame&s;ucken in the la&s;t century, the crime was
de&s;cribed in the out&s;et of the libel, as con&s;i&s;ting &startq;in the
&s;earching or &s;eeking for a per&s;on, <HI>in, or about, his hou&s;e.</HI>&endq; Ne|verthele&s;s,
the &s;ounder opinion &s;eems to be for re&s;tricting this
capital offence to that &s;ort of inva&s;ion, by the actual breaking
of the &s;afeguard of the man&s;ion-hou&s;e, which marks the re|&s;olute
and contemptuous &s;pirit of the offender. For though
he even come to the hou&s;e with a purpo&s;e to invade; it is an
equitable, and not unlikely con&s;truction, that but for the op|portunity
of finding the per&s;on abroad, and unprotected, he
might not venture to execute his intention. The ca&s;e of
Thomas Crombie in 1638, which is quoted by Mackenzie on
the other &s;ide, truly is not a precedent upon the matter; be|cau&s;e
the pannel was indicted, not for hame&s;ucken only, but
for trea&s;on, as having &s;truck within the precincts of a royal
palace, and for aught that appears may have been convicted on
that ground. In later times, two judgments have been given,
which are favourable to the milder con&s;truction. On the 4th of
March 1695, libel was rai&s;ed again&s;t James Balfour, Patrick
Wood and others, which relates, that Balfour &startq;came to the
hou&s;e of Sir John Hay with a de&s;ign to kill him, and having
&s;ent John Martin his &s;ervant to inquire for him, and ha|ving
<PB N="28" REF="29">
&s;pied him at his barn, upon which they came up to
him, and he civilly invited them to his hou&s;e to take a
drink, and as they were going to enter the gate, the &s;aid
Mr James Balfour, de&s;igning to murder the complainer
before he &s;hould get into his hou&s;e, he drew his &s;word and
made &s;everal thru&s;ts.&endq; This was charged as hame&s;ucken,
and the ca&s;e of Crombie was in&s;i&s;ted on in the debate; but
without effect with the Court, who found the charge only
relevant as an inva&s;ion, to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">March 6. 1695. &startq;Finds the libel not relevant to infer hame&s;ucken; but find the inva&s;ion libelled relevant again&s;t Mr James Balfour to infer an ar|bitrary puni&s;hment.&endq;</NOTE>
The other ca&s;e is that of David Hume, in October 1723,
where the a&s;&s;ault was charged as hame&s;ucken, being com|mitted
within the clo&s;e or court-yard of the hou&s;e of Seaton;
which (it was argued) was part of the hou&s;e or precincts,
where a per&s;on might properly be &s;aid to be at home. But
in this ca&s;e al&s;o, the libel was found not to be relevant to
the effect of inflicting death<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">&startq;Found, That the &s;aid pannel having, time and place fore&s;aid, invaded the per&s;ons of any of the &s;ervants of the &s;aid John Hor&s;ely, by beating, wounding, or otherwi&s;e, or the pannel having at that time in&s;tigated the Sinclairs to exe|cute their revenge again&s;t the &s;aid John Hor&s;ely, or his family, <HI>&s;eparatim,</HI> re|levant to in&s;er an arbitrary puni&s;hment.&endq;</NOTE></P>

the opening, with a &s;word, and wound him, &s;o that he falls

within his hou&s;e, and the protection and &s;ecurity thereof,
have been broken and contemned by the invader.</P>
<P>NOT only &s;o;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is &s;ufficient that the A&s;&s;ault be|gin within the Hou&s;e.</NOTE> but it will ju&s;tify the charge of hame&s;ucken,

pull him forth, notwith&s;tanding his re&s;i&s;tance, into
the highway or &s;treet, where they &s;et upon and beat him
with &s;taves; this, according to the received con&s;truction in
&s;uch matters, is as &s;ub&s;tantial a hame&s;ucken, as if they had
beaten him within the hou&s;e; &s;ince he is forcibly taken by
the pannels from thence, and there is begun to be invaded
with a purpo&s;e of doing that outrageous injury, which in the
end is done.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaur$, No. 62.</NOTE> And of this remark, the ca&s;e of Robert Mac|gregor,
convicted in January 1753, of the abduction of Jean
Key from her own hou&s;e, is an apt illu&s;tration. For the only
injury &s;u&s;tained by the woman within her hou&s;e, was in the
commencement of the a&s;&s;ault, by violently carrying her
from thence, which was done without any beating or wound|ing
of her per&s;on, though in oppo&s;ition to her &s;truggles.
But this was to be taken in connection with the abduction
to a di&s;tance, and the continued captivity, which were the
<PB N="30" REF="31">
&s;equel of the injury, and the fir&s;t objects of the a&s;&s;ault. He
accordingly had &s;entence of death, as convicted of hame|&s;ucken.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to de&s;erve the &s;ame con&s;truction, if a band of
ruffians be&s;et and break into the hou&s;e; whereupon the ma&s;|ter,
to &s;ave him&s;elf, leaps the window, and they follow and
overtake and wound him. A deliberate inva&s;ion of the
hou&s;e, on purpo&s;e to do mi&s;chief to the ma&s;ter, is an inva&s;ion
of the man him&s;elf. It is as much a <HI>force</HI> upon him, and a
per&s;onal injury, when he is driven from the hou&s;e in this
way, as if the invaders reached in and dragged him forth, or
entered and threw him out at the window: The &s;afeguard of
the hou&s;e is equally broken in either ca&s;e, and the man for|cibly
deprived of that protection, which the law intends for
him there. This, too, is agreeable to Skene's definition of

And farther; becau&s;e this way of proceeding, ba&s;e and cruel
though it be, plainly indicates the awe and fear that was
upon the pannel, of a&s;&s;ailing the per&s;on in his hou&s;e. Either
he dur&s;t not, on his own account, venture on &s;o dangerous an
enterpri&s;e, or he had &s;ome remains of reverence for the &s;anc|tuary

his malice from it. In either ca&s;e, he is not &s;o bold and pro|fligate
a character, as he who goes to &s;eek and invade the
object of his malice there. In fine, we cannot, without en|tirely

chance to be wounded in the conflict, the a&s;&s;ault will not be
capital; not being done upon forethought, but occa&s;ionally,
and for the &s;ake of e&s;cape, or upon the like &s;ugge&s;tion of
the moment. Farther; even a tortious and deliberate a&s;&s;ault
of a man's per&s;on within his hou&s;e will not in every in&s;tance
infer hame&s;ucken; &s;ince this may happen, and yet the a&s;|&s;ault
may not be made with that felonious <HI>animus,</HI> wherein
the aggravation lies. For what if the attempt be owing to
error on the part of the invader, or be made under mi&s;appre|hen&s;ion
of right; as for in&s;tance, in order to apprehend the
inhabitant of the hou&s;e as a debtor, or as a criminal, when in
truth there is no regular warrant again&s;t him, or when he is
mi&s;taken for another per&s;on? Certainly the officer mu&s;t
an&s;wer for any violence that en&s;ues, but not as for a hame|&s;ucken;
acting, as he here does, under an impre&s;&s;ion, though
erroneous, of right and duty, and not intending to a&s;&s;ault,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
but to do a lawful'act. Much le&s;s is it to be imagined that
there is room for &s;uch a charge, on the ground of irregular
or exce&s;&s;ive proceedings in the execution of a warrant
which is lawful. And of this remark there is an apt illu&s;tra|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 13. 1677.</NOTE>

hou&s;e, and followed with the riotous de&s;truction of all the
effects within it, and even with threats and abu&s;e of words
to the inhabitants, but without inva&s;ion of their per&s;ons, or
violence offered to any of them, will not &s;u&s;tain this &s;ort of
charge.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
THE injury &s;uffered on the occa&s;ion, mu&s;t al&s;o be grievous
and material.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Injury mu&s;t be material.</NOTE> For it is not to be imagined, that the law in|tends
to puni&s;h with death for a mere rout and di&s;turb|ance
in a man's hou&s;e, though accompanied with &s;ome &s;light
wrong to his per&s;on, &s;uch as &s;avours more of in&s;ult and con|tempt,
than of enmity or re&s;olution to do him harm. And
of this rule a convenient example may be found in the ca&s;e of
John Haldane;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20. and Aug. 5. 1718.</NOTE> where, though the libel charges that the pro|&s;ecutor
had been caught by the throat, and had a cane &s;ha|ken
over his head, and was even rai&s;ed from his bed, under
cloud of night, by a party of armed men, who forced or
took him into the &s;treet, yet &startq;the Lords found the facts,
as libelled, not to be of a nature &s;o atrocious as to infer
the crime of hame&s;ucken<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">According to the pannel's &s;tory, which &s;eems not unlikely, (but the judg|ment was not put upon this circum&s;tance), the ground of complaint was no more than the irregular execution of a warrant, ari&s;ing from the re&s;cue of the pro|&s;ecutor's &s;muggled goods, on the preceding day.</NOTE></P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide;<NOTE PLACE="marg">But may be of various Kinds, and for different Objects.</NOTE> if the injury is of the due rank and
degree, little di&s;tinction &s;eems to be made concerning the
de&s;cription of it in other re&s;pects. Not only all the modes
of in&s;tant harm to the body are within the meaning of
the law; as by &s;tabbing, or firing at and wounding, or vio|lently
beating the per&s;on; or by binding and &s;tarving, or
confining within the hou&s;e; but tho&s;e al&s;o where the pre|&s;ent
bodily harm is incon&s;iderable, compared with the &s;uf|fering
of other &s;orts which attends it, and without which it
would not at all be regarded. Thus it is hame&s;ucken, to at|tempt
the committing of a rape on a woman in her own
hou&s;e; or violently to carry her off from thence into captivity,
<PB N="36" REF="37">
whether with a view to rape or to a forcible marri&aacute;ge. For
the injury is not to be mea&s;ured by the mere &s;uffering of the
body, but by the whole accompanying circum&s;tances of di|&s;tre&s;s,
alarm, and terror, and the colour of the evil that is
intended to be done. This point was argued at large in
the ca&s;e of James Macgregor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 60. 62.</NOTE> and was decided in that
of his brother Robert<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The major propo&s;ition of the libel, de&s;cribed the crime thus: &startq;The violent entering the hou&s;e of the decea&s;ed without her licence, and contrary to the King's peace; the &s;eeking or a&s;&s;aulting her there, with intent to do her a mo&s;t heinous and atrocious injury, namely, the crimes which actually follow|ed, being the abduction of her per&s;on, the celebrating a marriage with her, and the violation of her cha&s;tity; all of them gone about forcibly, and by way of continuation of the &s;ame violent and wicked attempt.&endq;</NOTE>, who &s;uffered death for invading
Jean Key in her own hou&s;e, and forcibly carrying her from
thence, in order to compel her to a marriage. So much
is this the law, that ca&s;es may well be imagined where
hame&s;ucken &s;hall be committed, though the body be nowi&s;e
hurt, if the per&s;on be, in a proper &s;en&s;e, invaded; as if a
man be fired at in his hou&s;e, or be pur&s;ued through it, from
room to room, with a drawn &s;word, though in the end he
e&s;cape unhurt, and &s;uffer no injury but in the fear and
danger of his life. And much the &s;ame thing it &s;eems to
be, if by menace of death, and the holding of a pi&s;tol to
his head, or a dagger to his throat, a per&s;on is forced to &s;ub|&s;cribe
a bond for money, or the relea&s;e of a debt that is
due to him. Money is indeed the pannel's ultimate object
in &s;uch a ca&s;e, (as it may al&s;o be in the ca&s;e of abduction,
and as lu&s;t generally is in the ca&s;e of rape): But this will
not hinder us to conceive the crime as hame&s;ucken, &s;ince
the per&s;onal a&s;&s;ault is a nece&s;&s;ary means towards attainment
of tho&s;e ends; &s;o that whoever would accompli&s;h the one,
<PB N="37" REF="38">
mu&s;t intend the other. The truth is, that a fal&s;e notion
&s;eems to have gone abroad re&s;pecting hame&s;ucken, as if
it con&s;i&s;ted only in that &s;ort of injury, the <HI>beating</HI> of the
per&s;on, which more ordinarily than any other is the ob|ject
of &s;uch enterpri&s;es. Whereas the notion of it in law,
and which is announced in &s;o many words in the out&s;et of
many of the older libels, (as in the ca&s;e of Meldrum,
December 7. 1674, and of Muir, November 8. and 9. 1675),
is far more general, and con&s;i&s;ts in &startq;the &s;eeking of a
per&s;on at his hou&s;e to do him an injury, prejudice, or
hurt.&endq; And &s;o &s;ays Skene in his Treati&s;e of Crimes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It is explained at large in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e by Mathaeus, as under&s;tood in the law of Utrecht.</NOTE>:

it<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. b. 4. ch. 10.</NOTE>. But this rule has now, for more than a cen|tury,
been &s;o entirely altered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 11. 1692.</NOTE> that in the ca&s;e of Keith of
Lentu&s;h, action was &s;u&s;tained at the di&s;tance of more than

of the charge, a long delay to pro&s;ecute for this or any

the a&s;&s;ize.</P>
<P>MACKENZIE has remarked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Wit|ne&s;&s;es in it.</NOTE> that with re&s;pect to the mat|ter

<PB N="38" REF="39">
mo&s;t part only po&s;&s;ible to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the te&s;timony of
the near connections of the party injured. This appears
from the interlocutor in the ca&s;e of Thomas Muir,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9. 1675.</NOTE> admit|ting
women to be witne&s;&s;es, (contrary to the practice of tho&s;e

Rape, and Hame&s;ucken, the only <HI>offences again&s;t

them above their rank at common law. For others, the
offender is only liable to &s;ome inferior correction, at the
plea&s;ure of the Judge. I &s;hall begin with the former.</P>
<P>AMONG which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute again&s;t beating or cur|&s;ing or Parents.</NOTE> the mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tance of any is
created by the &s;tatute 1661, ch. 20. which ordains, &startq;That
who&s;oever, &s;on or daughter, above the age of &s;ixteen years,
not being di&s;tracted, &s;hall beat or cur&s;e either their father or
mother, &s;hall be put to death without mercy; and &s;uch as
are within the age of &s;ixteen years, and pa&s;t the age of
pupillarity, to be puni&s;hed at the arbitriment of the Judge,
according to their de&s;ervings, that others may hear and
fear, and not do the like.&endq; The object of this enactment,
<PB N="40" REF="41">
was not only to guard the parent again&s;t the violence of per|&s;ons,
who have &s;o many opportunities of indulging their
hatred, if once, unhappily, they &s;hall come to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
with it; but al&s;o, and perhaps chiefly, for the intere&s;t of mo|rality
and order, which are &s;o deeply wounded by the unna|tural
&s;pectacle of the hand of the child lifted again&s;t the pa|rent,
or his tongue directing cur&s;es again&s;t tho&s;e whom mo&s;t
he ought to cheri&s;h and revere.</P>
<P>THE &s;tatute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requi&s;ites of the &s;tatutory Charge.</NOTE> very properly, requires two things towards
the inflicting of the capital puni&s;hment; &s;uch an age, and
&s;uch a mea&s;ure of under&s;tanding, in the pannel, as give a&s;|&s;urance
of his knowing the due reverence of a parent, and
make him accountable for the violation of it. Though not
expre&s;&s;ed in the law, it &s;eems al&s;o to be a good defence
again&s;t the &s;tatutory charge, that the parent has occa&s;ion|ed
the injury by cruel and exce&s;&s;ive abu&s;e of the per&s;on of
the pannel. Not that common injuries will excu&s;e any &s;ort of
retaliation on the part of the child, who, by law and nature,
is &s;ubject to, and mu&s;t patiently &s;uffer, the parents judgment
and correction, (even though arbitrary and capricious), both
of words and per&s;onal di&s;cipline. But that the Legi&s;lature
have not <HI>utterly</HI> excluded this defence of provocation, which
applies in all other ca&s;es of a&s;&s;ault, and probably did not in|tend
to puni&s;h the child with the &s;evere&s;t pains of law, for
words, (how un&s;eemly &s;oever), nor even for blows, if only
extorted by the outrageous &s;everity of bodily cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>To be relevant under the &s;tatute, the charge mu&s;t al&s;o be
of a proper and real a&s;&s;ault, by &s;triking and hurting; not of
a mere &s;truggle or wre&s;tling, without blows or injury to the
per&s;on. In like manner the cur&s;ing, which is, however,
capital without any beating, mu&s;t not con&s;i&s;t in undutiful or
<PB N="41" REF="42">
indecent words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">REAL INJURIES.</NOTE> &s;poken of or with relation to the parent; as
by wi&s;hing for his death, or that evil may befal him, or
threatening him with mi&s;chief, or the like; but in &s;ome
&s;trong and violent execration directed again&s;t him. If the
words are uttered in the pre&s;ence of the parent, this, in every
point of view, is the highe&s;t degree of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; the
&s;tronge&s;t mark of the depravity of the child, who, if he offend,
in this way, mu&s;t be &s;teeled again&s;t all &s;en&s;e of awe and re|verence,
and the greate&s;t &s;hock to the feelings of the parent,
and of all who hear it. The words of the &s;tatute do not,
however, &s;eem to authori&s;e any di&s;tinction in that re&s;pect;
and, from the tenor of the charge which was found relevant
in the ca&s;e of Philip Stansfield,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 23. and Feb. 6.&amp; 7. 1688.</NOTE> it is at lea&s;t doubtful whether
any of the words libelled were uttered in the pre&s;ence of
his father. The Court in that ca&s;e, &startq;found the&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions,
or either of them, viz. the devil take him, the devil
rive him, God damn him, relevant to infer the pain of
death.&endq; In regard to certain other expre&s;&s;ions, which
are charged in the libel, &s;uch as the wi&s;hing that his father
might never return&mdash;that he might choke upon his meat&mdash;or
never more have food in his &s;tomach; the interlocutor does
not take notice of them. He was convicted both of the cur|&s;ing
and the killing of his father, and had &s;entence of death,<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See State Trials, vol. iv. p. 283.</NOTE>.
In the later ca&s;e of David Young,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 26. and July 24. 1738.</NOTE> for

the like relevancy was found on the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, &startq;God

<P>IN both in&s;tances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of the Charge of cur|&s;ing Parents.</NOTE> the preci&s;e words uttered by the pannel

the Legi&s;lature have made peculiar provi&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws again&s;t a&s;|&s;aulting of Cler|gymen.</NOTE> are the Clergy
of the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church of Scotland; who&s;e character and
function ought to &s;erve as a protection to them again&s;t any &s;ort
of violence, and even at common law would &s;harpen the &s;eve|rity
of the &s;entence upon any who &s;hould invade them. But
in our times of religious &s;chi&s;m, and while things were fluc|tuating
between the Pre&s;byterian e&s;tabli&s;hment and the Epi&s;|copal,
far from proving a &s;hield to the clergy, their func|tion
was the very circum&s;tance which expo&s;ed them, as
the peculiar objects of aver&s;ion, to every &s;ort of mole&s;ta|tion
from the adherents of the oppo&s;ite communion; as in|deed
it mu&s;t be owned, that the clergy them&s;elves, of either
per&s;ua&s;ion, were not &s;low to encourage their followers to
the like per&s;ecution of their antagoni&s;ts. Statutes were
therefore pa&s;&s;ed, at different periods, for the better protec|tion
of the e&s;tabli&s;hment for the time. By the act 1587,
c. 27. it is puni&s;hable with e&s;cheat of moveables, to invade
or lay violent hands upon a mini&s;ter, if it be done on ac|count
of things pertaining to his function, &s;uch as inflicting
eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures, refu&s;al to marry excommunicated
per&s;ons, &s;eeking payment of his &s;tipend, or the like. The
act 1633, c. 7. extends this penalty to the inva&s;ion of the
dignified clergy, at that time re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and to the in|va&s;ion
of mini&s;ters on any account, and whether made by
the offender per&s;onally, or through others by his direction
or allowance. La&s;tly; by &s;tatute 1670, c. 4. at a time of
<PB N="44" REF="45">
great bitterne&s;s between the rival churches, the puni&s;hment
was rai&s;ed to death and confi&s;cation of moveables, in the
ca&s;e of a&s;&s;ault with intent to kill a mini&s;ter, or to rob his
hou&s;e; for in this &s;en&s;e I con&s;true the words of that law.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent century has furni&s;hed two in&s;tances of pro&s;e|cution
for a&s;&s;aulting a mini&s;ter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro&s;ecutions on the&s;e laws.</NOTE> One was in February 1719,

<P>4. IN this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Striking in Pre|&s;ence of King, or in his Cham|ber, &amp;c.</NOTE> it will however be proper cur&s;orily to take
notice of the enactment, though now in &s;ome points inappli|cable,
of certain of our old &s;tatutes concerning matters of the

The &s;ame pains are applied by this &s;tatute to the &s;triking
within the King's Privy Council Hou&s;e, during the &s;itting of
Council; and for this offence, John Young &startq;poultryman,&endq;
had &s;entence of death, on the 11th October 1627. But the&s;e
are among the trea&s;ons which are aboli&s;hed by the act 7th Anne,

high pre&s;ence in which they are done, they remain liable to
&s;ome &s;evere correction at common law.</P>
<P>BY the &s;ame &s;tatute it is made a capital crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Striking in the King's Palace.</NOTE> (and this &s;eems

<P>5. LET us now de&s;cend to tho&s;e offences again&s;t the per|&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of A&s;&s;aults pu|ni&s;hable at com|mon Law.</NOTE>
which remain upon the foot of common law, and are
only puni&s;hable with &s;ome inferior pain, at the di&s;cretion
of the Court. The&s;e are various in kind and degree; and
the law is provided with &s;undry corre&s;ponding terms for
them, more or le&s;s comprehen&s;ive, &s;uch as a&s;&s;ault, inva&s;ion,
beating and brui&s;ing, blooding and wounding, &s;tabbing, mu|tilation,
demembration, and &s;ome others, under which, ac|cording
to the nature of the injury, the fact may be charged
in any libel. But although the injury &s;hould not come un|der
any of the ordinary terms of &s;tyle, nor be of that nature,
to be announced in a &s;ingle phra&s;e; this circum&s;tance will
nowi&s;e affect the competency of a pro&s;ecution. Let the
<HI>major</HI> propo&s;ition of the libel give an intelligible account of
it in terms at large, and, if it amount to a real injury, it &s;hall
be &s;u&s;tained to infer puni&s;hment, greater or le&s;s, <HI>pro modo
admi&s;&s;i;</HI> without any regard to the new or extraordinary na|ture
of the wrong. We have, be&s;ides, in our law, the general
term of <HI>&s;tellionate,</HI> borrowed from the Roman practice, where
it was applied to every offence that was not di&s;tingui&s;hed by a
peculiar name, and which, if it is thought worth while, may
be employed in &s;uch a ca&s;e, along with the full de&s;cription
of the injury. This was done in the libel again&s;t James
<PB N="48" REF="49">
Campbell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 8. 15. 22. 1722.</NOTE> which bore a charge of certain &s;trange and
&s;hameful violations of the pur&s;uer's per&s;on<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Macnaughton and Campbell were pri&s;oners in the &s;ame goal. Campbell had filled Macnaughton drunk, &s;tripped him in part naked, and tied his privities with a cord to &s;ome fixture in the fire-place. In this &s;ituation, he repeatedly applied fire to tho&s;e parts of the man's body, as he lay &s;tretched upon chairs by the fire-place. This was charged in the out&s;et of the libel as <HI>&s;tellionate</HI> and real inju|ry; along with a de&s;cription of the wrong.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>6. THE mo&s;t heinous &s;ort of a&s;&s;ault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wounding with Intent to kill.</NOTE> is that which is com|mitted,
not with intent to hurt or wound, but to de&s;troy.
In which ca&s;e, though, by the benignity of our practice,
the offender is judged according to the event, and not ac|cording
to the wickedne&s;s of his heart, yet the Judge is
warranted to inflict the highe&s;t pains on him that are known
to the law, after tho&s;e of death. In three late in&s;tances of
this character, the offender has been tran&s;ported for life.
I allude to the ca&s;e of Alexander Syme, December 16.
1754, for &s;hooting at and wounding in the head; to the
ca&s;e of John Ogilvy, March 8. 1756, for &s;tabbing in the
belly; and to the ca&s;e of Thomas Young, July 8. 11. 1771,
for &s;tabbing a per&s;on in the &s;ide, as he lay a&s;leep. In the la&s;t
ca&s;e, death had only been prevented by the knife breaking
&s;hort upon a rib.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e in&s;tances, the mortal purpo&s;e had been followed
with a &s;eyere and grievous wound inflicted on the per&s;on. But
even when no &s;uch bodily harm en&s;ues, &s;till the invading with
intent to kill, as by &s;hooting, or thru&s;ting with a &s;word, is an
aggravated &s;pecies of a&s;&s;ault, for which the offender &s;hall
be &s;ubject to pro&s;ecution, as well at in&s;tance of the pri|vate
party, as of the King. Becau&s;e, though not hurt in his
body, the individual has neverthele&s;s a &s;ub&s;tantial intere&s;t
<PB N="49" REF="50">
to pro&s;ecute, both on account of the real injury and
&s;uffering in the in&s;tant fear of his life, and in order to
deter the offender from any renewal of his attempt. After
full debate, his title was accordingly &s;u&s;tained in &s;uch a
ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 30. 1744.</NOTE> that of James Ju&s;tice and David Hume<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lord Kames was then at the bar, and was coun&s;el for the pannels, and had &s;tirred this objection to the pur&s;uer's title.</NOTE>; and Ju&s;tice,
being convicted, was decreed to pay L. 150 of damages and
co&s;ts.</P>
<P>BESIDE this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;ault with In|tent to ravi&s;h, or rob, or extort a Deed.</NOTE> the mo&s;t alarming of any, there are other
purpo&s;es of mi&s;chief which very much aggravate an a&s;&s;ault
upon the per&s;on, and make it liable to greater &s;everity of
puni&s;hment than could be u&s;ed, on pure con&s;ideration of the
harm which is &s;uffered in the body. Thus an a&s;&s;ault upon
a woman is aggravated, and may be puni&s;hed with bani&s;h|ment
and whipping, or other infamous pain, if it is made
with intent to ravi&s;h, or to carry off her per&s;on. The &s;ame
is true of an a&s;&s;ault upon any one, if it be made with in|tention
to rob, or to compel the granting of a deed, or the
like; for this puts in fear of the highe&s;t violence, in ca&s;e of
re&s;i&s;tance or delay to comply.</P>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e injuries which are carried the length of actual
harm to the per&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demembration, if a capital crime.</NOTE> one of the mo&s;t atrocious is by the &s;epara|tion

of it in &s;uch a manner, as renders it un&s;erviceable to its pro|per
u&s;es. Some things have even contributed to rai&s;e a doubt
re&s;pecting the&s;e modes of injury, whether in &s;trictne&s;s, and

are either &s;aid to be capital offences, or are
cla&s;&s;ed with &s;uch as are &s;o. Moreover, it appears from the
criminal record, that when &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed on the mutilator
for any lower puni&s;hment, it was u&s;ual to decern him, (as if
&s;omething were &s;till wanting to his entire ab&s;olvitor and

<P>NEVERTHELESS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demembration, if a capital Crime.</NOTE> there &s;eems rea&s;on to conclude upon the
whole, that the &s;tatute of Robert, which is not expre&s;&s;ed in
an ab&s;olute or peremptory &s;tyle, was only intended <HI>in terrorem,</HI>
for obliging the offender to make reparation to the party
le&s;ed, and thus extingui&s;h the feud that was between them.
Certain it is, that the record does not afford a &s;ingle in|&s;tance
of capital conviction for this offence. Nay in
one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 14. 1609. and, April 18. 1610.</NOTE> and an old ca&s;e, that of Andrew Hender&s;on, on re|ference
of the proper doom for mutilation to the King
and Council, there came an act and order recommending
to bani&s;h the pannel, &startq;&s;eing y^e paine of daith in any
&s;uch caice has nocht bene accu&s;tomit to be execute in
this kingdome.&endq; Mackenzie, accordingly, has not only
<PB N="51" REF="52">
omitted to take any &s;pecial notice of the&s;e, as di&s;tinct from
other real injuries, but farther, in his ob&s;ervations on the act
1540, c. 118. has &s;aid in very plain terms that they are not
capital offences. Add to the&s;e the opinion of Pitmed|den,
who, in his treati&s;e of the&s;e crimes, comes to this
conclu&s;ion, &startq;That mutilation and demembration are now
puni&s;hable <HI>poena injuriarum arbitraria,</HI> like other injuries
committed by private violence, for which the law &s;tates
no particular puni&s;hment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Part II. No. 159.</NOTE>.&endq; And in truth there is a judg|ment,
though not taken notice of in either of the&s;e authorities,
which &s;eems to be deci&s;ive of the whole controver&s;y; having
been given in a ca&s;e, which probably was not tried with any
degree of favour towards the pannel; the ca&s;e of James
Mitchell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 1678.</NOTE> who in firing at Bi&s;hop Sharp, had wounded and
mutilated the Bi&s;hop of Orkney, (who was in the coach
with Sharp), in the arm. The dittay was laid for the crime
of mutilation among others, and concluded for the pains
of death; which were al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted for in the debate. But,
the Court upon full con&s;ideration found, &startq;that article of
the dittay anent the invading, wounding and mutilating
of the Bi&s;hop of Orkney, relevant to infer an arbitrary
puni&s;hment.&endq;</P>
<P>IT thus becomes of no moment to engage in tho&s;e nume|rous
and minute controver&s;ies, which &s;ub&s;i&s;t among the fo|reign
doctors re&s;pecting &s;everal points of this &s;ort of charge,
and e&s;pecially touching the &s;everal parts of the human frame,
how far they are to be reputed di&s;tinct members of the body,
whereof mutilation or demembration can be committed.
For, without regard to that circum&s;tance, and though no
&s;uch terms &s;hould be employed in the charge, there is always
room for inflicting an adequate and proper puni&s;hment on
<PB N="52" REF="53">
the offender. In like manner, there &s;eems now no longer
to be any good rea&s;on why proce&s;s for mutilation &s;hould not
be &s;u&s;tained (contrary to the ancient practice),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proce&s;s for Mu|tilation, if com|petent within the Year.</NOTE> before lap&s;e
of year and day from the date of the injury. Such a rule
might indeed be very &s;uitable, as long as it was imagined
that the pannel's life might perhaps be an&s;werable for his
offence; but it would not &s;erve any u&s;eful purpo&s;e at the pre|&s;ent
day, when the party le&s;ed can only lay his libel for an
arbitrary puni&s;hment, and, if he rai&s;e his action at an early
period, mu&s;t accept of &s;uch an atonement as upon in&s;pec|tion
of the wound, and according to the proof of what he
has already endured, the Court &s;hall con&s;ider to be due to
him. If he be content with this amends, there is no rea&s;on
why the pannel &s;hould con&s;train him to delay his pro&s;ecu|tion,
until it &s;hall be evident whether the member is mutila|ted
pa&s;t recovery or not. Action was therefore &s;u&s;tained
within the year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 50.</NOTE> upon a libel which charged the fact under
the various terms of mutilation, invading, beating, and
wounding.</P>
<P>THE u&s;ual cour&s;e of puni&s;hment in ca&s;es of mutilation
and other the like atrocious injuries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Law for violent A&s;|&s;aults.</NOTE> when pro&s;ecuted for
the public intere&s;t, has been by &s;courging, and bani&s;hment
forth of Scotland. This was the &s;entence, (among many
in&s;tances that might be mentioned), upon Archibald Mathie
and Robert Falconar for an outrageous act of brui&s;ing and
beating;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 3. 1791. Dec. 27. 1791.</NOTE> and upon John Macali&s;ter, for wounding in the face
with a knife, whereby an artery was cut, and the per&s;on
put in danger of his life. In ca&s;es of inferior violence,
recour&s;e is had to impri&s;onment and fine, and, if the party
le&s;ed pur&s;ues, and the pannel can pay, to an award of co&s;ts
and damages, in addition to tho&s;e penalties; together, in

&s;ome ca&s;es, with &s;urety to keep the peace for a certain
time.</P>
<P>7. THE other articles which may &s;eem to be material to|wards
the better knowledge of the doctrine re&s;pecting a&s;&s;ault
or real injury, are chiefly the&s;e. The degree of violence,
which is thought worthy of the cogni&s;ance of the Supreme
Court; the &s;ort of provocation that will ju&s;tify the act, or
alleviate the guilt; and the ways wherein the injury may
be remitted.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e heads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slight A&s;&s;aults, if cogni&s;able in the Court of Ju&s;ticiary.</NOTE> it will be difficult to fix on
any preci&s;e rule of limitation. The Legi&s;lature have not
interpo&s;ed in this, as in the civil department of bu&s;ine&s;s, to
hinder the bringing of the le&s;s important ca&s;es, in the fir&s;t
in&s;tance, before the Supreme and mo&s;t expen&s;ive Judicature.
Nor indeed are there the &s;ame rea&s;ons, nor would there be
the &s;ame propriety, in e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch a rule for criminal
as for civil proce&s;s. Becau&s;e there is not the &s;ame multi|plicity
of bu&s;ine&s;s to occupy the Judges of the Criminal
Court; and becau&s;e no general rule could well be made to
&s;uit the &s;everal qualities of crimes, which are &s;o diver&s;ified by
circum&s;tances; as well as that no ca&s;e can ju&s;tly be deemed
unworthy of the notice of even the highe&s;t tribunal, in which
the re&s;training of per&s;onal violence, or the intere&s;t of di&s;|cipline
and order, is concerned.</P>
<P>NOT only, therefore, has it always been held actionable
before the Court of Ju&s;ticiary, to &s;trike with any &s;ort of inva|&s;ive,
though not mortal weapon, &s;uch as cane, whip, or baton,
(of which it were tedious to recount the many convictions);

THOUGH this rule &s;eems to be grounded in very expedient

mea&s;ure of puni&s;hment &s;hall always be applied to a wanton
or malicious inva&s;ion, and to one which is only made on
provocation of foul and reproachful words, which may be
&s;uch, and uttered in &s;uch &s;ituations, that they are very hard
to be born. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, it may be de&s;irable, but is
not always ea&s;y, to follow out the cour&s;e of conduct which
is recommended by a foreign lawyer, the learned Berli|chius.
The be&s;t method, &s;ays he, of retorting a verbal in|jury
is thus. Let not the per&s;on attacked in this way open
his mouth upon the &s;pot at all, but wait till the provoker has
fini&s;hed his addre&s;s, and thrown out again&s;t him all he has
to &s;ay. Then let him &s;traight home,&mdash;fly to his clo&s;et,&mdash;
take pen in hand, and &s;et down fairly in writing, whatever
his rage &s;ugge&s;ts to him as fit for the occa&s;ion. This done,
he has to call a notary, and deliver him the compo&s;ition, with
orders to go into the per&s;onal pre&s;ence of the offender, and
read it over to him, and take written note of his reply.
The notary's bu&s;ine&s;s is to reduce the mutual <HI>&s;colding</HI> into the

which la&s;t we con&s;idered, invalidates the defence of pro|vocation;
and this is, if the provocation be not recent.
For, if the law in any ca&s;e allows retaliation, it is &s;till
<PB N="63" REF="64">
with reluctance, and out of nece&s;&s;ary compa&s;&s;ion only for the
frailty of human nature, which is apt to be &s;urpri&s;ed and

is only made <HI>ex intervallo,</HI> after lap&s;e of a &s;ufficient time for
rea&s;on to re&s;ume her &s;eat. For &s;uch a deed does not &s;avour of

Accordingly, to <HI>extenuate</HI> the guilt of an a&s;&s;ault made in

But farther than has now been &s;aid, no plea of this kind
can well be carried in favour of the a&s;&s;ailant. As indeed, if
admitted with a greater latitude in point of time, the defence
at bottom would re&s;olve into that of enmity or grudge be|tween
the parties; which is no excu&s;e for a deliberate injury
and breach of the peace, and for this, if for no other rea&s;on,
cannot be &s;u&s;tained, that the proof and hi&s;tory of &s;uch feuds
would &s;well out of all manageable bounds, and in mo&s;t in&s;tan|ces
would only i&s;&s;ue in e&s;tabli&s;hing the mutual intemperance

to be two;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proce&s;s for real Injury, how ex|cluded.</NOTE> by remi&s;&s;ion, and by pre&s;cription; which la&s;t may
be con&s;idered as a remi&s;&s;ion implied from the &s;ilence of the
party le&s;ed. But though it may &s;eem likely, that the&s;e equi|table

have found no in&s;tance of the application of them in prac|tice,
from which to &s;tate either the particular period of taci|turnity
that &s;hall be held to be &s;ufficient, or the mode and form
of the remi&s;&s;ion, whether it mu&s;t be in writing, or may al&s;o
be made in words, if &s;erious and explicit. As to the latter ar|ticle,
a different deci&s;ion may probably be given, according
to the degree and atrocity of the wrong. Tho&s;e which con|&s;i&s;t
<PB N="66" REF="67">
in mere contumely or in&s;ult, may the more ea&s;ily be abo|li&s;hed;
perhaps by formal a&s;king and receiving of pardon,
in pre&s;ence of the common friends of the parties. But in re|gard
to &s;uch whereby any great di&s;tre&s;s or damage has been
&s;u&s;tained, it may be more doubtful whether any thing le&s;s
than a written di&s;charge or a bargain implemented on one
&s;ide, is &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h the right of pro&s;ecution for
them; &s;eeing the claim is of as much importance as many
others, which require that mode of acquittance. This, at
any rate, is &s;ettled, that remi&s;&s;ion of any the more atrocious
injuries is not to be inferred from the meeting of the par|ties
at table, their familiar conver&s;ation, or occa&s;ional &s;o|ciety,
or other the like appearances of reconciliation. The&s;e
may be very fallacious, and at mo&s;t only go to &s;hew that
there was once a di&s;po&s;ition or purpo&s;e to forgive; a pur|po&s;e,
which until it be carried into effect in &s;ome more de|finite
and bu&s;ine&s;s-like form, the party injured may alter at
his plea&s;ure. The whole defences were repelled in the fol|lowing
ca&s;es, notwith&s;tanding the pannel's allegation of
friendly and convivial meetings with the pro&s;ecutor, of pro|fe&s;&s;ions
tending towards reconcilement, and even, in one in|&s;tance,
of good offices done the pannel in a &s;ituation of
di&s;tre&s;s; the ca&s;e of James Campbell, January 8. 1722; of

action was &s;u&s;tained at the di&s;tance of more than a year from
the time of the a&s;&s;ault. A year, by the Roman law, appears
to have been the limited period of the Praetorian and civil

real injury, <HI>ad id quanti qui&s;que injuriam ae&s;timaverit:</HI> But it
<PB N="67" REF="68">

With us, of Scotland, a di&s;tinction may perhaps
be ob&s;erved in this re&s;pect, between the greater and le&s;&s;er
injuries, and even between the action of the private party,
and that of the Lord Advocate; of whom it will be pre&s;u|med,
that he pro&s;ecutes as &s;oon as his information enables
him, and circum&s;tances make it proper. It is certain,
that within the period, (when it &s;hall be &s;ettled), which
is allowed that officer to pro&s;ecute for &s;uch violations of
the public peace, his right is independent of even the mo&s;t
expre&s;s remi&s;&s;ion by the party le&s;ed, and much more of any
implied forgivene&s;s or dereliction. Judgment was given

it may be fit to mention, that be&s;ide the&s;e, and &s;undry
other appellations, under which a real injury may properly
be charged, there is one more, not quite &s;o &s;uitable, that of
<HI>oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> which, by the older &s;tyle, was often introdu|ced
into the libel. The ju&s;t application of this term is in

objects, it had in practice come to be applied to a great va|riety
of other ca&s;es, as among private individuals, where
there was no pretence of any bond of dependence or &s;ubjec|tion.

the different kinds and degrees of real injury. The
other cla&s;s of injuries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verbal Injuries, if actionable in the Ju&s;ticiary.</NOTE> which are named Verbal, (by rea&s;on of
the forms of &s;$eaking and writing, in which they are commit|ted),
though in &s;ome in&s;tances more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing than violence
inflicted on the per&s;on, and for the mo&s;t part far more de&s;ti|tute
of excu&s;e on the part of the offender, have however, in
compari&s;on of the former, very &s;eldom been pro&s;ecuted in the
Criminal Court. The rea&s;on may be, that they are &s;o various
in kind and degree; and that there is another Court, that of
the Commi&s;&s;aries, in which the reparation, ordinarily the mo&s;t
&s;uitable to this &s;ort of injury, and the mo&s;t acceptable to the
par$y injured, reparation by fine, palinode, and damages, can
with le&s;s expence and trouble be obtained. For the &s;ame rea|&s;on,
and to hinder individuals from mole&s;ting each other up|on
trivial occa&s;ions, it has ju&s;tly been held that the Lords of

to any ca&s;e of this &s;ort which is brought before them,
whether it be of that importance which requires the interpo|&s;ition
<PB N="71" REF="72">
of their authority, or be more fit for the cogni&s;ance of
the Commi&s;&s;aries or other Judges. Mackenzie, in treat|ing
of verbal injury<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">B. 1. Tit. 30. No. 4.</NOTE>, by which he under&s;tands &s;poken in|jury,
has even &s;aid, that the Court of Ju&s;ticiary will not in
any ca&s;e &s;u&s;tain action for it, when committed again&s;t a
private per&s;on; and he mentions a deci&s;ion to that effect,
(though without a date), which was given upon libel at in|&s;tance
of a mini&s;ter again&s;t one who had accu&s;ed him of
perjury. The ca&s;e alluded to is probably that of Andrew
Straiton again&s;t David Doig, of the 17th February 1673;
but in&s;tead of authori&s;ing the inference which that author
has made from it, the deci&s;ion &s;eems rather to be an argu|ment
for that di&s;cretionary power of the Court to which
I have alluded. It is in the&s;e words: &startq;The Lords fand,
<HI>that this cau&s;e is not of that nature that it needs to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed
before this Supreme Court,</HI> and therefore de&s;erts the diet,
and leaves the pur&s;uer to pur&s;ue before the inferior judge
competent.&endq; Neverthele&s;s, the rule delivered by Mac|kenzie
is certainly that which their Lord&s;hips will in ge|neral,
and for the rea&s;ons above mentioned, be di&s;po&s;ed
to follow, with re&s;pect to a &s;poken, or even a written injury,
directed again&s;t a per&s;on in his private capacity only.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the information which is to be got on this
head from the records, the ca&s;es of &s;lander, whether written
or &s;poken, which &s;hall clearly be held relevant, and fit for
the cogni&s;ance of the Supreme Court, are chiefly of the
following de&s;criptions; though I do not mean to affirm
that future practice &s;hall make no addition to them.</P>
<P>1. IT is an undoubted point of dittay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slandering of Judges.</NOTE> and &s;hall be treated
more at large in another place, as an offence again&s;t the
cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, to defame, or, as it is termed in our an|cient
<PB N="72" REF="73">
laws, <HI>to murmur,</HI> any Magi&s;trate or Judge, by charging
him, whether in words or writing, with corruption, par|tiality,
oppre&s;&s;ion, or failure of duty in his &s;tation. For this
is an offence, not more intere&s;ting to the per&s;on &s;landered,
than to the public, who have the deepe&s;t concern in main|taining
the opinion of his pure and con&s;cientious admini&s;tra|tion
of his office.</P>
<P>2. ANOTHER undoubted in&s;tance is the calumnious pro&s;ecu|tion
of a crime;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calumnious Pur|&s;uit for a Crime.</NOTE> an injury whereof the redre&s;s is naturally
&s;ought from that tribunal in which the prejudice was attempt|ed
to be done the complainer, and which indeed is in &s;ome
mea&s;ure it&s;elf in&s;ulted in the purpo&s;e to impo&s;e on its ju&s;tice
and di&s;cernment; as well as that the wrong in &s;uch a ca&s;e is
not a pure &s;lander, or injury to fame, but al&s;o in &s;ome &s;en&s;e a
real injury, as tending to endanger the accu&s;ed in law, and
to put him in fear of the i&s;&s;ue. There are, accordingly,
in the books of adjournal, &s;everal in&s;tances of libel of recri|mination,
rai&s;ed by a pannel again&s;t his pro&s;ecutor for ca|lumny
and defamation; though few of them &s;eem to have
been &s;o well grounded in the circum&s;tances of the fir&s;t pro|&s;ecution,
on which depends the relevancy of the&s;e counter li|bels,
as to be followed with, or to be entitled to &s;ucce&s;s. None
of them are, however, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed as incompetent, but as irre|levant
only. Such was the judgment on the libel of recri|mination,

One in&s;tance, however,
there is of conviction on &s;uch a ground, in the proceedings
between Bri&s;bane of Selvilands on the one part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1. 7. 8. 1704.</NOTE> and Hou&s;ton
of John&s;ton, and Walkin&s;haw <HI>junior</HI> of that Ilk, on the
other; whom Bri&s;bane, &s;omewhat ra&s;hly, had pro&s;ecuted
for hou&s;e-breaking and Stouthrief. The&s;e pannels called
Bri&s;bane in a counter action, for the malicious defama|tion
of his Maje&s;ty's lieges; and this the Court &startq;found re|levant
to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment, in ca&s;e the pur|&s;uer
Selviland &s;uccumb in the probation of his libel.&endq;
Both libels were &s;ent to one a&s;&s;ize; and the i&s;&s;ue was, that
a clear <HI>alibi</HI> being proved on the part of Hou&s;ton and Walkin|&s;haw,
they were a&s;&s;oilzied from Bri&s;bane's charge, and had
decree again&s;t him for 400 merks of damages and fine.</P>
<P>3. A THIRD ground of dittay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calumnious In|formation of a Crime.</NOTE> and nearly allied to the la&s;t, is
the calumnious <HI>information</HI> of a crime, or the indu&s;triou&s;ly pro|pagating
again&s;t any one, in either a &s;poken or written form,
the fal&s;e charge of a particular criminal act. In it&s;elf, this is
a far more &s;erious and prejudicial &s;ort of &s;lander than the u&s;ing
of reproachful, but loo&s;e and general appellations, &s;uch as
thief, adulterer, and the like, which &s;eems to be a fitter &s;ub|ject
of proce&s;s in the Civil Court; if even there &s;uch abu&s;e
<PB N="74" REF="75">
is to be &s;u&s;tained as a ground of action, when thrown out
pa&s;&s;ionately, and without allu&s;ion to any &s;pecial occurrence.
But on the former and more intere&s;ting ground, there is
an in&s;tance of criminal pur&s;uit &s;u&s;tained: I allude to the
pro&s;ecution at in&s;tance of Sir Alexander Rigby again&s;t
Mary Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 17. and Aug. 1. 1710.</NOTE>, Charles I&s;aack&s;on and others; again&s;t
her, for accu&s;ing him in a written declaration, and again&s;t
the others, for corrupting her to accu&s;e him of adulte|ry,
(he being a married man), and as the father of her
ba&s;tard child. The libel bore a charge of <HI>defamation</HI> and
<HI>prevarication,</HI> (for at fir&s;t &s;he had fixed on I&s;aack&s;on as
her paramour), and was found relevant to infer an arbi|trary
puni&s;hment;<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Augu&s;t 1. 1710. &startq;The Lords found Mary Hamilton, pannel, her having, in the pangs of child-birth, and before the kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion of Edinburgh or Canon|gate, declared that Mr I&s;aack&s;on was the father of her child; and afterwards, for money or other reward, retracting the &s;aid declaration, and giving out Sir Alexander Rigby, pur&s;uer, to be the father, relevant to infer an arbitrary pu|ni&s;hment.&endq;</P>

made pre&s;entment of Kennedy, to be tried on the Ju&s;tice

injury (as he pretended to con&s;ider it), Kennedy compo&s;ed a
fal&s;e indictment again&s;t the Sheriff, bearing charge of oppre&s;|&s;ion,
perjury, adultery, Sabbath-breaking, and forgery; and
this dittay, which never was meant to be brought before any
Judge, he had printed and indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed, along with
<PB N="75" REF="76">
a pretended an&s;wer by Kennedy to the charge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">VERBAL INJURIES.</NOTE> For this,

Kennedy on the other hand pur&s;ued Fergu&s;on, on account of
his alleged calumnious pre&s;entment. In truth Kennedy had
taken the benefit of an act of indemnity, to avoid trial of
the very charges contained in the pre&s;entment; and his li|bel
in con&s;equence was found irrelevant. The other was
&s;u&s;tained to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment and damages.
And Kennedy, being convicted, had &s;entence to pay a fine of
L. 1000 Scots, and to apppear and acknowledge his fault, fir&s;t
before the Lords of Ju&s;ticiary, and afterwards to Fergu&s;on,
&s;itting in judgment in his own Court.</P>
<P>THE malice of the offender in this in&s;tance was evident in
the whole circum&s;tances of the &s;tory.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calumnious In|formation of a Crime.</NOTE> And in general
the criminal pro&s;ecution is herein di&s;tingui&s;hed from the

other, though the parties be not even known to each other,
if the things &s;aid are in them&s;elves of an injurious tendency
with re&s;pect to the pur&s;uer. It was for a defect in this qua|lity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. 1714.</NOTE>
that judgment was given di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the libel at in&s;tance

of the charge of calumny being only this, that Ru&s;&s;ell had
<PB N="76" REF="77">
informed again&s;t, and got warrant to apprehend Hu&s;band,
on &s;u&s;picion of having &s;et fire to his barn-yard; but which
warrant was not executed; neither was the Charge made
without &s;ome cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, nor indu&s;triou&s;ly publi&s;h|ed
to the world. In the action pur&s;ued by James Sands

charge of the re&s;et of a &s;tolen ewe, by her exhibited to the
Ju&s;tices of the Peace for Orkney, and on which &s;he had
been &s;ucce&s;sful in obtaining a decree, the Court, on the 1&s;t
Augu&s;t 1712, &startq;found, That the Ju&s;tices of Peace having
&s;u&s;tained her complaint, &s;he cannot be accu&s;ed of a calum|ny.&endq;
But this judgment, though it was probably right in
the particular in&s;tance, is &s;carcely to be received as a rule for
future ca&s;es of the kind; &s;ince it is po&s;&s;ible that the informer
may impo&s;e on the Judge, and even that the Judge may be

was the allegation, (but found to be groundle&s;s), in this very

<P>4. THE only other ca&s;e in which I find that libel has
been &s;u&s;tained for injurious words thrown out again&s;t an indi|vidual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slander mixed with Violence</NOTE>
is that of words uttered in pre&s;ence of the complainer;

and attended with &s;uch circum&s;tances of rage and di&s;turb|ance,
as ju&s;tly to alarm with the fear of farther mi&s;|chief;
&s;o that the offence is not a pure &s;lander, but has in
it a mixture of violence, and a tendency towards a real
a&s;&s;ault. The libel at in&s;tance of Elizabeth Hamilton, Lady
St Foord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1708. Jan. 1709.</NOTE> again&s;t Patrick Gordon, bore, among other char|ges,
one of this complexion. It related, that Gordon ha|ving
gone to the Lady's hou&s;e at the head of an armed
party, and having &s;puilzied certain goods which &s;he had
recently poinded from him, he at the &s;ame time in&s;ulted her
with many foul names, (&s;uch as <HI>common whore, adulterous bitch,</HI>
and the like), and threw out a fal&s;e charge again&s;t her, of
having born a ba&s;tard in England; threatening her al&s;o with
blows, if &s;he &s;hould pre&s;ume to an&s;wer. Now, taken in all
its circum&s;tances, this was a charge of both violence and
&s;lander, each aggravated by the other. The&s;e reproaches were

termed in our &s;tatutes), or calumny directed again&s;t the
King.</P>
<P>THIS we find acknowledged as a point of dittay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws again&s;t Lea&s;ing-making.</NOTE> and rank|ed
as a high tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, as long ago as the time of Ro|bert

words: &startq;<HI>Statuit et defendit dominus Rex quod nullus &s;it con&s;pi|rator

<P>THE next &s;tatute that relates to lea&s;ing-making,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws again&s;t Lea&s;ing-making.</NOTE> is the act

one might be led to conjecture, that the original notion of
lea&s;ing-making was that of calumny carried to the King
again&s;t a &s;ubject; or at lea&s;t that this was that mode of the
crime which had chiefly been con&s;idered in practice. But
more probably, it is only an awkwardne&s;s, (&s;uch as is
not uncommon in our &s;tatute-book), of the form of expre&s;|&s;ion.
All the later laws are de&s;igned for protection of the
King.</P>

the intemperance of the clergy of that time, who had
indulged in violent &s;arca&s;m and invective again&s;t the King,
with relation to his laws for the government of the Church.</P>
<P>IN addition to this (certainly &s;evere) ordinance, the act

<P>LAST of all;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws again&s;t Lea&s;ing-making.</NOTE> the act 1609, c. 9. makes provi&s;ion again&s;t
tho&s;e who &s;hall endeavour to rai&s;e di&s;cord between the
inhabitants of the two kingdoms, (at that time recently
united under one &s;overeign), by publi&s;hing or uttering of
writings or &s;peeches, &startq;to the &s;lander or reproch of the
<PB N="81" REF="82">
e&s;tate, people, or countrie of England, or di&s;honour or pre|judice
of any Coun&s;eller of the &s;aid kingdome.&endq; It orders
that the offenders in this &s;ort &s;hall be &s;everely puni&s;hed &startq;in
their per&s;ons and goods, by impri&s;onment, bani&s;hment,
fyning, or mair rigorous corporal pain, as the qualitie of
the offence &s;hall be found to merite, at his Maje&s;tie's
plea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE are the &s;everal enactments touching this crime of
lea&s;ing-making; which, though very fit to be &s;harply re|proved,
was, however, too &s;everely dealt with in being &s;ub|jected
to the pain of death, even if the Legi&s;lature had
employed more definite terms in de&s;cribing the offence.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;tep towards the correction of this rigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws again&s;t Lea&s;ing-making.</NOTE> was
at the Revolution, when the Claim of Right, without directly
&s;pecifying, did in effect impugn the&s;e laws, in that article
which &s;ets forth the grievance &startq;of cau&s;ing pur&s;ue and forfeit
per&s;ons upon <HI>&s;tretches</HI> of old and ob&s;olete laws, and upon
frivolous and weak pretences, &amp;c. as particularly the late
Earl of Argyle.&endq; The re&s;ult was the pa&s;&s;ing of the &s;tatute
1703, c. 4.; which, upon the narrative of the generality of
the &s;aid &s;tatutes, and the various con&s;tructions to which they
were liable, and the dangerous con&s;equence of this <HI>as to the
capital puni&s;hment,</HI> relaxed their &s;everity, and ordained, that
the puni&s;hment &s;hould for the future &startq;only be arbitrary,
according to the demerit of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that is, by
fining, impri&s;onment, or bani&s;hment; or if the party offen|der
be poor, and not able to pay a fine, then to be pu|ni&s;hed
in his body; life and limb always pre&s;erved.&endq;</P>
<P>THE crime, therefore, and <HI>nomen juris,</HI> and the &s;tatutes in
relation to it, &s;till remain a part of our &s;y&s;tem; though
the&s;e la&s;t are not now &s;o likely to be u&s;ed as grounds of
<PB N="82" REF="83">
charge by them&s;elves, as in confirmation of the common
law. I &s;ay in confirmation of the common law; for I think
it is not to be doubted, that the offence would have been
cogni&s;able, and perhaps to the effect of inflicting as high
pains as tho&s;e which are allowed in the act 1703, although
the Legi&s;lature had never interpo&s;ed with any provi&s;ion on
the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the nature of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Crime.</NOTE> Accord|ing
to the de&s;cription given of it in the &s;tatutes, and the cour&s;e
of practice by which they have been applied and explained,
it is a verbal injury levelled again&s;t the King, and which
is con&s;trued in the law to proceed out of malice and evil
di&s;po&s;ition, entertained again&s;t him. Now, under this gene|ral
account of it, two &s;pecies of offen&s;ive act &s;eem to be in|cluded.
And in the fir&s;t place, lea&s;ing-making may be com|mitted
by the invention of &s;uch rumours, &s;tories, and allega|tions
with re&s;pect to his Maje&s;ty, as are to his prejudice or
di&s;honour, and in their con&s;equences may tend to le&s;&s;en his
e&s;timation with his people, or to impair the good under|&s;tanding
that is between them.</P>
<P>I SHALL mention calumnies of different kinds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lea&s;ing-making, by challenge of the King's Title.</NOTE> which
may &s;erve to illu&s;trate this branch of the &s;ubject. One
of the mo&s;t undoubted in&s;tances, and which has more
frequently been exemplified than any other, is the &s;pread|ing
of &s;uch a report with re&s;pect to the King, as tends to
impeach his title to the throne; as if one &s;hould call the
King a ba&s;tard, or a Papi&s;t. Thus, on the 3d Augu&s;t 1596,
in virtue of the &s;aid &s;tatutes 1584, 1585, and 1594, which
are the grounds laid in the dittay, John Dick&s;on in Lyn, an
Engli&s;hman, is convicted and doomed to die &startq;for uttering

<P>ONE of the olde&s;t trials of this cla&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lea&s;ing-making, by A&s;per&s;ion of the King's Con|duct. Oct. 8. 1600.</NOTE> is that of Francis
Tennant, who &s;uffered death for writing under feigned
names, and laying down in one of the churches of Edin|burgh,
two letters which contained &s;landerous calumnies
and reproaches to the di&s;honour of the King, his progeni|tors,
Council, and proceedings. The letters them&s;elves are
not in the record<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">There is this entry on the margin of the record: &startq;<HI>Nota,</HI> Immediately af|ter dome pronuncin, Mr Thomas Hamilton, (the Lord Advocate), tuik up the twa letters, writs, and pa&s;quills, the ane direct to Mr Robert Bruce, and the uthir to Mr John Davi&s;on, mini&s;ters, whilk twa pa&s;quills he wald not have in&s;erted in the record;&endq; probably on account of their indecency.</NOTE> but it may be gathered from the allu|&s;ions
to them in the entry of the dittay, which is laid upon
the &s;tatutes again&s;t lea&s;ing-makers, that they had &s;lander|ed
the King in both the ways above de&s;cribed. The next
in&s;tance is the trial of George Nicol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 8. 1633.</NOTE> indicted on the &s;ame
&s;tatutes, for the malicious compiling of two papers, of
which one calumniated the King's Coun&s;ellors and great
officers, e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to their dilapidation and
mi&s;management of his revenue; and the other impeached the
King's own mea&s;ures and proceedings. The Privy Council
<PB N="87" REF="88">
took this trial into their own hands; and the culprit was &s;en|tenced
to pillory and bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>SOON after this came the trial of Lord Balmerino,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lea&s;ing-making, by A&s;per&s;ion of the King's Con|duct.</NOTE> in 1635.
The libel again&s;t this nobleman was mainly laid on the act
1594, c. 209. <HI>anent lea&s;ing-makers,</HI> and charged him with
writing a wicked pamphlet again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and
government; at lea&s;t with &s;howing and divulging it to
others; at lea&s;t with reading and hearing it, and knowing
the author, and neither taking him, nor revealing the of|fence.
It appears that this compo&s;ition was in the form of a
petition to the King, and that it contained an a&s;&s;emblage of
charges injurious to his character, and in mi&s;con&s;truction of
his proceedings. It related, that the King had by ge&s;ture,
and otherwi&s;e, taken note of, and &s;hewn his di&s;plea&s;ure at
certain per&s;ons, who oppo&s;ed his mea&s;ures in Parliament,
and e&s;pecially his acts of Church-government; that he had
ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to their rea&s;ons of di&s;&s;ent from
tho&s;e acts; that he denied liberty of &s;itting upon the Commit|tee
of Articles to &s;ome who had right to &s;it there, and admit|ted
Papi&s;ts, who had none. It proceeded to &s;et forth, that his
taxes were heavy, and that the produce of them was not em|ployed
to the public behoof, but lavi&s;hed upon diver&s;e per|&s;ons,
&startq;wha&s;e <HI>wa&s;trie</HI> and wants, your good &s;ubjects are not
obliged to &s;upply.&endq; This, (it adds), was contrary to the
promi&s;es contained in his proclamations, and &s;peeches in
Parliament; and after complaining of his &s;ervants for mal|admini&s;tration
of the money, it concludes with reminding
him, that the pen&s;ions and &s;alaries of office, (which had of
late been increa&s;ed), were &s;till as &s;ufficient for the places,
as they had been in his father's time, and that none had
<PB N="88" REF="89">
been found to refu&s;e the places, by rea&s;on of the moderate
fees. This was the &s;ub&s;tance of the charge. The a&s;&s;ize
&startq;find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 11. 1635.</NOTE> pronounce and declare, the &s;aid John Lord Balme|rino
to be allenarly fyled and convict of the hearing the
&s;aid infamous libel, concealing and not revealing it.
Whereupon the Court find the &s;aid John, &amp;c. to have in|curred
the pain of death, contained in the act 1594; but
&s;u&s;pends the execution thereof till &s;uch time as his Ma|je&s;ty's
gracious will and plea&s;ure be &s;hewn thereanent;
and order him to be remanded, in the mean time, to ward,
in the Ca&s;tle of Edinburgh.&endq;</P>
<P>I KNOW not whether I &s;hould next mention, (for it was a
plain perver&s;ion of the&s;e &s;tatutes or any of them), the ca&s;e
of Archibald Earl of Argyle in December 1681; who had
judgment of death for adding this explanation, at taking the
te&s;t-oath,&mdash;That he took it as far as it was con&s;i&s;tent with
it&s;elf, or with the Prote&s;tant religion. This, by a mo&s;t
violent and unnatural con&s;truction, was wre&s;ted into a depra|ving
of the King's laws and proceedings, contrary to the act
1585, c. 10.; as if the Earl had charged the King with the
impo&s;ing of contradictory oaths, and &s;uch as were ho&s;tile to
the Prote&s;tant faith<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See State Trials, vol. iii. p. 441.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LAST of all, notice may be taken of the ca&s;e of James Sands,
Thomas Baikie and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 21. 1712.</NOTE> who, among other mi&s;demeanours,
were charged with lea&s;ing-making; in as much as in the cour&s;e
of their &s;ermons, they had indulged in an invective again&s;t
the Liturgy of the Church of England, (which they compared
to the wor&s;hip of Baal), and had affirmed that the Tolera|tion
Act was an infringement of the Claim of Right, and &s;uch
an ordinance as the Queen could not lawfully a&s;&s;ent to, nor pa&s;s
into a law. The la&s;t part of this charge was found relevant
<PB N="89" REF="90">
to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>&startq;And as to the article again&s;t Mr Baikie, for reflecting on the Liturgy of the Church of England, find the &s;ame <HI>not relevant;</HI> and as to the article again&s;t Mr Baikie, for what he is alleged to have preached concerning the Toleration Act, find, that his u&s;ing in the pulpit, when preaching to the people, the ex|pre&s;&s;ions libelled, or others directly, and not by inference, to the &s;ame import, relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment.&endq;</P>
<P>The libel begins thus: &startq;Whereas, by the laws of God, the laws of this and all other well governed realms, habitual drunkenne&s;s, all bla&s;phemy, &amp;c.&mdash;all undue and &s;candalous reflections ca&s;t upon the Government, or tho&s;e entru&s;ted in the management thereof; all lea&s;ing-making, and attempts of making divi|&s;ion and bad under&s;tanding betwixt the Sovereign and his &s;ubjects; all open robbery, &amp;c.&endq;</P></NOTE>; but the pannels were not
convicted.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;till one mode of calumny more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moving Jealou|&s;y between the King and Nobles.</NOTE> which is re|ferrible
to this fir&s;t head of lea&s;ing-making, and was perhaps
in the beginning more regarded by the law than any of the
others. This is the fal&s;e invention of &s;tories and rela|tions,
of a more &s;pecial and private nature, &s;uch as may
tend to move mi&s;liking or jealou&s;y between the King and
any of his Coun&s;ellors and &s;ervants, or other eminent or
powerful per&s;on in the State. For, be&s;ide the indignity offered
to the Sovereign, in the invention of any &s;uch fal&s;ehood with
re&s;pect to him, it had been con&s;idered of how much con&s;e|quence
it is, not only to the King per&s;onally, but to the State
and common weal, to maintain a due confidence and affection
between him and all &s;uch per&s;ons of influence in the coun|try;
whereby not only ari&s;eth a &s;ecurity for the continuance
of tranquillity, as far as concerns tho&s;e per&s;ons them&s;elves,
but for the zealous render of their &s;ervices on occa&s;ions of dan|ger
or commotion. In the &s;tate of Scotland in former times,
<PB N="90" REF="91">
this was a con&s;ideration of &s;till higher importance than it
is now.</P>
<P>THUS, fal&s;ely to report to any of the King's Council that
the King has called him a traitor, and is preparing to
take mea&s;ures again&s;t him, or to &s;uch a Judge of the Su|preme
Court, that the King has charged him with partiality
to traitors and corruption in his office; this would be lea&s;ing-making.
As, on the other &s;ide, it would equally amount to
that offence, in terms of the &s;tatute 1540, c. 83. if one
&s;hould carry to the King a fal&s;e and malicious information
again&s;t &s;uch a Privy Coun&s;ellor or Officer of State, of his
being engaged in a traiterous corre&s;pondence with the
King's enemies, or having made an attempt on the ho|nour
of his Con&s;ort, or any of his family. Not to mention
other very obvious rea&s;ons, which probably contributed to
the pa&s;&s;ing of that law; the evil was the &s;ame to the Prince,
of jealou&s;y between him and his Nobles, in whichever way
of calumny it was &s;tirred; and the mover of &s;uch lies might
ju&s;tly be held to be equally the enemy of the King, whom
he di&s;quieted by &s;uch information, and mi&s;led into &s;u&s;pi|cion
of a good &s;ervant, as of the &s;ubject whom he thus
defamed.</P>
<P>THE record offers &s;undry pro&s;ecutions of this &s;ort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slander of Nobles to the King.</NOTE> and
more than one conviction. On the 20th Augu&s;t 1618, Tho|mas
Ro&s;s was convicted of lea&s;ing-making; having pub|li&s;hed
and affixed at Oxford a pa&s;quinade and invective
again&s;t the Scotti&s;h nation, wherein he exhorted the Engli&s;h
to drive them out of the realm, as a pernicious and unprofi|table
race. It appears from the libel, which is laid on the fore|&s;aid
&s;tatutes, that this &s;atire had been taken up as e&s;pecially
to the calumny and prejudice &startq;of his Maje&s;tie's guid &s;ub|jectis
<PB N="91" REF="92">
and &s;ervandis attendantis upon and about his Ma|je&s;tie's
Royal Per&s;one and Court.&endq; The author had &s;en|tence
of death on the 10th of September 1618.</P>
<P>ON the 30th November 1631, James, Lord Ochiltree, was
accu&s;ed at in&s;tance of the Lord Advocate for lea&s;ing-making
committed again&s;t James, Marquis of Hamilton, the Earl of
Melro&s;e and others, by fal&s;e information given of them to
the King, as engaged in &s;ome trea&s;onable plot again&s;t him.
A learned debate took place upon this charge; but the mat|ter
was not even pro&s;ecuted to the obtaining of a judgment
on the relevancy of the libel.</P>
<P>THE next in date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slander of Nobles to the King. July 21. 1641.</NOTE> and pro&s;ecuted with a more unrelenting
&s;pirit, was the accu&s;ation of John Stuart, Commi&s;&s;ary of Dun|keld,
for lea&s;ing-making again&s;t the Earl of Argyle, in alleging
that the Earl had circulated and pre&s;ented bonds to the lieges,
obliging them to follow him, without re&s;ervation of the King
or State. Stuart was convicted on this charge, and &s;uffer|ed
death. If, as the after events give rea&s;on to believe, this
unfortunate man only fell a victim for having done his
duty, and reporting the truth; his death was before long
avenged on the family of his accu&s;er, who&s;e de&s;cendant, as
we have &s;een, was him&s;elf, by an equally unju&s;t &s;entence,
brought to the &s;caffold on a charge of lea&s;ing-making
again&s;t the King.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of John Niven, is a third in&s;tance of pro&s;ecu|tion
for calumny uttered again&s;t a &s;ubject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 15. 1680.</NOTE> He was tried
for railing again&s;t the Duke of York, and accu&s;ing him of
a plot to kill the King, to combine with the French, and
introduce Popery. He had judgment of death; but it does
not appear that the &s;entence was put in execution.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">
THE late&s;t in&s;tance of this &s;ort of pro&s;ecution is that of
David Baillie, who, on the 4th of February 1704, had &s;en|tence
of pillory and bani&s;hment, upon trial before the Privy
Council, for lea&s;ing-making again&s;t the Duke of Queen&s;berry
and the Marquis of Annandale.</P>
<P>THESE &s;everal examples may &s;erve as illu&s;trations of the
fir&s;t and mo&s;t genuine mode of our ancient offence of lea|&s;ing-making.</P>
<P>THE other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Railing or &s;cof|fing at the King.</NOTE> and perhaps more improper mode of it, (but
which al&s;o behoved to be known as a crime at common law),
embraced in general all words and &s;peeches uttered to the
di&s;dain, reproach, or contempt of the King; that is <HI>convi|ciandi

vituperation of that high Per&s;on. Hereunto are refer|red
all &s;uch pa&s;&s;ionate and bitter &s;peeches as indicate the

reverence of his royal name and authority. For in&s;tance;

his &s;ub&s;cription, or running in his name, if this is accompanied
with words of open contempt of him, his laws and man|dates;
all the&s;e are in&s;tances of that mi&s;chievous and inde|cent
<HI>vituperation</HI> of the King, which the law cannot pa&s;s over
<PB N="93" REF="94">
unpuni&s;hed, and to which, equally as to the invention of &s;pe|cial
reports and &s;landers with re&s;pect to him, it &s;eems to
have been held, that the later &s;tatutes, in their general ex|pre&s;&s;ions
already quoted, intended to apply the &s;anction of
the highe&s;t pains. At lea&s;t, I can find no other probable ground
in law, upon which the following convictions could proceed.
On the 17th May 1615, John Fleming had &s;entence of death
on a charge of publicly expre&s;&s;ing his de&s;ire of the King's
death; having wi&s;hed &startq;that the King might &s;hoot to dead
or the morn, and die of the falling &s;ickne&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>ON the 4th December 1662, John Dobie, weaver in Gla&s;|gow,
was tried on a libel which is laid upon the act
1585, c. 10. and charges him with having expre&s;&s;ed his hope
&startq;to &s;ee the King pulled off the throne, and hanged along
with his whole party;&endq; and al&s;o, with evil wi&s;hes again&s;t
the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner, who was pa&s;&s;ing through the we&s;t
towards Galloway at the time. He was convicted on full
evidence; but I cannot find that any &s;entence en&s;ued<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">A ca&s;e, in &s;ome mea&s;ure allied to the&s;e, was that of Archibald Cornwall, who had &s;entence of death and <HI>forfeiture,</HI> April 25. 1601, for <HI>di&s;honouring and defaming</HI> his Maje&s;ty, by affixing his portrait to the po&s;ts of a gallows. But it ap|pears from the &s;entence, and the expre&s;&s;ions of the verdict, that this offence had been &s;trained into a re&s;emblance of trea&s;on. In the ca&s;e of Fleming al&s;o, the &s;peeches are &s;tyled &startq;trea&s;onable, bla&s;phemous, and damnable &s;peeches;&endq; but there is no mention of forfeiture in the &s;entence.</NOTE>.

<P>UPON the whole of the&s;e illu&s;trations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tinction of Lea&s;ing-making and Sedition.</NOTE> the peculiar and
di&s;tinctive character of lea&s;ing-making appears to lie in this,
that it is a verbal injury directed again&s;t the King; pro|ceeding,
or in the con&s;truction of law under&s;tood to pro|ceed,
from evil di&s;po&s;ition with re&s;pect to him, and intended
to do him prejudice as a per&s;on.</P>
<P>IT is true, that in their con&s;equences, &s;uch mi&s;demeanours
may often lead to the farther mi&s;chief of commotion or di&s;|turbance
in the State; and certainly of all the&s;e practices
it may with ju&s;tice be &s;aid, that by injuring the re&s;pect of
Maje&s;ty, and le&s;&s;ening the Sovereign in the e&s;teem of his
&s;ubjects, they tend, le&s;s or more, to loo&s;en the bonds of al|legiance,
and to place the minds of men in that po&s;ition,
where they may be &s;u&s;ceptible of new impre&s;&s;ions. Nor is
it to be doubted, (indeed in &s;ome of the &s;tatutes it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed),
that this was one rea&s;on among others, why a ver|bal
injury levelled again&s;t that high per&s;onage was account|ed
of a more heinous nature, and was more &s;everely puni&s;hed,
than in the ca&s;e of an ordinary man. But, although lea&s;ing-making
may occa&s;ion &s;uch evil con&s;equences, the legal notion
of that offence does not include any malicious purpo&s;e to
produce them. Its characteri&s;tic, or peculiar quality, and that
which di&s;tingui&s;hes it from &s;edition, with which it has &s;ome|times
been confounded, is, that the fal&s;ehood is not vented
<HI>eo intuitu,</HI>&mdash;with the purpo&s;e of un&s;ettling the State,&mdash;nor ori|ginates
in any high or formed project of that &s;ort, but in the
malice only of the inventor towards the King as a per&s;on,
and has for its object to gratify the &s;pleen and ill humour
with which the defamer is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in regard to him, or,
<PB N="96" REF="97">
(if that may be), to mole&s;t and di&s;quiet the King, and do him
an injury in his fame. When committed again&s;t his Maje&s;ty,
it is &s;till a crime of the &s;ame cla&s;s and character, as when
committed, (which according to the act 1540 it may equally
be), again&s;t any of his Coun&s;ellors or great Barons. And cer|tainly
it will not be &s;aid of every &s;lander or malicious tale
carried to the King of any of tho&s;e per&s;ons, that it ne|ce&s;&s;arily
implies a purpo&s;e to corrupt the loyalty of the
people, and breed di&s;turbance in the State. This, therefore,
is one circum&s;tance, (though apt to be overlooked, owing to
the long di&s;u&s;e of &s;uch pro&s;ecutions on the part of &s;ubjects),
which marks the ju&s;t and peculiar character of lea&s;ing-making,

it always has relation to the King, or, (if that is not aboli&s;h|ed

of any <HI>cour&s;e of mea&s;ures and actions,</HI> &s;uch as directly tends
to re&s;i&s;tance of the Legi&s;lature or e&s;tabli&s;hed Government,
or to the new modelling of the State without the authority of
<PB N="97" REF="98">
law. No invective, therefore, how violent &s;oever, again&s;t
monarchy in general, no abu&s;e, the mo&s;t outrageous, of the
Briti&s;h con&s;titution, no proceedings, though ever &s;o plainly
tending to aboli&s;h that venerable &s;y&s;tem, and &s;et up a new
form of government in its room, would ju&s;tify a charge of
lea&s;ing-making. Becau&s;e, though all involving the &s;tate and
office of the King, as part of the con&s;titution, &s;uch projects
are levelled again&s;t the whole &s;y&s;tem, and are not moved
out of &s;pecial grudge to the Prince upon the throne, but
&s;pring from a deeper and more malignant principle, as well
as employ more direct and more exten&s;ive means, than that
of mere &s;lander of the per&s;on and conduct of the King.
Thus &s;edition is a proper crime again&s;t the State, and holds
the next place after trea&s;on, to which it is nearly allied,
and which it may often, hut by a &s;hort interval, precede.
The other is a per&s;onal offence or verbal injury offered to
the King, and which the law con&s;iders in &s;o much a more
&s;erious light than other injuries of that cla&s;s, partly by rea|&s;on
of the ju&s;t regard it has to the peace and tranquillity of
the Head of the State, the mo&s;t eminent per&s;on in the land;
and partly by rea&s;on of the po&s;&s;ible evil influence of &s;uch
an example on the affections and di&s;po&s;itions of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome in&s;tances it may indeed be difficult to draw the line
between the two tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tinction of Lea&s;ing-making and Sedition.</NOTE> but this no more hinders them
to be di&s;tinct, than in the ca&s;e of forgery and fal&s;ehood, or of
theft, fraud, and breach of tru&s;t; charges which are &s;till more
difficult to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by certain and palpable rules.
For in&s;tance, to cur&s;e the King and his race, and to pour
out &s;landers or reproaches and evil wi&s;hes again&s;t him,&mdash;
if it be done at the in&s;tant, by one who finds him&s;elf di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
from a lucrative office about the King's per&s;on, and
<PB N="98" REF="99">
if it is accompanied with the ordinary &s;ymptoms of vexa|tion
and di&s;appointment; this effu&s;ion of ill temper, though
far from &s;alutary to &s;uch as witne&s;s it, and certainly cog|ni&s;able
in a criminal court, is not, however, an act of proper
&s;edition. It is not a <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> taken to debauch the people
and di&s;turb the State, but a pure injury to the King; a con|tempt
and reproach, (<HI>convicium</HI>), directed again&s;t him, and
uttered out of di&s;like of his Maje&s;ty as a per&s;on, or to &s;a|tisfy
the &s;pleen and rancour of the &s;peaker. But if, (as in
the ca&s;e of Craig,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 8. 1793.</NOTE> Morton, and others), the like practice is
detected at a period which teems with projects of change,
and in per&s;ons who are found to have entered one of the
King's garri&s;ons, and there, in pre&s;ence of the King's &s;ol|diers,
to have drunk perdition to the King and his race, <HI>and
to all crowned heads,</HI> and to have accompanied this impious
wi&s;h with promi&s;es and in&s;inuations of advantage to the &s;ol|diers,
if they will betray the King, or with &s;uch di&s;cour|&s;es
as are plainly calculated to &s;hake their fidelity; then
this &s;ame fundamental act, thus qualified and expounded,
is no longer a bare contumely or indecency, (as in the ca&s;e
of Fleming, or of Oliphant), but an act of palpable and
real &s;edition,&mdash;an attempt and mea&s;ure to corrupt the forces
of the State, and deprive it of its means of defence again&s;t
tumult and in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>AGAIN;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tinction of Lea&s;ing-making and Sedition.</NOTE> let us imagine a time, &s;o profligate as to produce
a &s;atire on the Royal Family, full of per&s;onal reproach and
obloquy to the King, his progenitors and race. Let us &s;up|po&s;e
it to de&s;cribe them as de&s;titute of all the virtues of their
&s;tation, and addicted to the vices and the plea&s;ures of the
lowe&s;t of the people; and that in &s;upport of this invective,
the libel proceeds with a fal&s;e narrative of &s;undry inci|dents
<PB N="99" REF="100">
in the King's hou&s;ehold, or family-concerns. Wicked
and abominable as &s;uch a compo&s;ition is; yet if it be en|tirely
of this &s;landerous de&s;cription, and neither is mingled
with ob&s;ervations and inferences of a political nature, nor
can from circum&s;tances be &s;hewn to have been calculated
for any purpo&s;e of public commotion, and e&s;pecially if it
can be traced to any cau&s;e of per&s;onal quarrel with any of
the Royal Family; it &s;till does not amount to the State crime
of &s;edition, but only to lea&s;ing-making or defamation of the
King, and may be pro&s;ecuted on the &s;tatutes in that behalf.</P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t needs think otherwi&s;e of that author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tinction of Lea&s;ing-making and Sedition.</NOTE> who,
having no &s;uch cau&s;e of quarrel with his Maje&s;ty, &s;hall
compo&s;e a work of rea&s;oning and argument, wherein, be&s;ide
indulging in the like reproach of the Royal Per&s;on, he &s;hall
attempt to &s;hew that all kingly government is an abu&s;e, and
that our own monarchy is a &s;y&s;tem of fraud and inju&s;tice;
and as a remedy for the&s;e evils, &s;hall propo&s;e a plan of a&s;&s;o|ciation,
to new model the &s;tate after another and more popu|lar
fa&s;hion. An addre&s;s of this kind is not merely out of
pique or &s;pleen, or for indulgence of humour again&s;t a per|&s;on,
but hath a more &s;erious character, and a deeper &s;eat. It
is <HI>a mea&s;ure and proceeding,</HI> which tends <HI>directly</HI> to occa&s;ion a
breach between Prince and people, <HI>and is taken by the author
for no other purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>IN the&s;e in&s;tances the di&s;tinction is ea&s;y to be perceived.
Yet it is not and cannot be denied, that in other in&s;tances
there is a near affinity of the two crimes: in &s;o much that ca&s;es
may be imagined (and perhaps this is true of &s;ome which have
been already cited), of &s;uch a character, as &s;hall be in one
both lea&s;ing-making and &s;edition, or of which it &s;hall be hard
<PB N="100" REF="101">
to &s;ay whether they more properly belong to the one or
other denomination, or which might with propriety be li|belled
alternatively, as the one or the other, according
to the circum&s;tances of the fact, as they &s;hall appear in evi|dence
upon the trial.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 21. 1712.</NOTE> In the ca&s;e, accordingly, of James
Sands and others, which was in &s;ome mea&s;ure of this de|&s;cription,
there was not only a charge of lea&s;ing-making
upon the &s;lander as referrible to the Queen, but a charge of
undue and &s;candalous reflections ca&s;t upon the government
of the country.</P>
<P>PUT the ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tinction of Lea&s;ing making and Sedition.</NOTE> that a di&s;graced favorite a&s;&s;embles his
friends, and acquaints them that the King is a Papi&s;t, and
has a purpo&s;e again&s;t the Prote&s;tant religion; under which
pretence he exhorts them to re&s;i&s;tance, and concerts with
them the means of &s;trengthening their intere&s;t with the
people, &s;o as they may make head again&s;t him. This &s;eems
to be both lea&s;ing-making and &s;edition. It is the telling of
a lie again&s;t the King, and upon that lie grounding a mea|&s;ure
of ho&s;tility and di&s;affection, to di&s;turb the State.</P>
<P>BUT although the two offences may thus in &s;ome in&s;tances
coincide, yet lea&s;ing-making and &s;edition are not convertible
terms. There is lea&s;ing-making which is not &s;edition; and
there is &s;edition which is not lea&s;ing-making, and could not
with any propriety be charged as &s;uch. This, in particular,
was the judgment of the Court upon the indictments of Muir,
Palmer, Gerald, and their a&s;&s;ociates, tried for &s;editious prac|tices,
in 1793 and 1794. And certainly this di&s;tinction applied
to tho&s;e ca&s;es in its fulle&s;t force. For in none of them was
there any charge of &s;lander circulated, or of reproach or con|tempt
thrown out, again&s;t his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, but of writings
di&s;tributed, combinations formed, meetings held, and re&s;o|lutions
<PB N="101" REF="102">
lutions taken, &s;uch as were calculated to withdraw the affec|tions
of the people from the e&s;tabli&s;hed government of the
land, and di&s;po&s;e them to work its downfal at all hazards,
and without regard or di&s;tinction of means.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the puni&s;hment of lea&s;ing-making<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funi&s;hment of Lea&s;ing-making</NOTE> It is
limited by the act of Anne, to fine, impri&s;onment, or ba|ni&s;hment;
under which la&s;t term, in the ca&s;es of Gerald
and Sinclair, in February and March 1794, the Lords of Ju|&s;ticiary
had occa&s;ion incidentally, but very deliberately,
to give their opinion, that bani&s;hment by tran&s;portation to
the foreign colonies is included.</P>
<P>AND here, (that I may not entirely pa&s;s over a matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If puni&s;hable with Tran&s;portation.</NOTE>
which, though of no uncommon intere&s;t or curio&s;ty in it&s;elf,
has however of late been more agitated than almo&s;t any
point of the Scotti&s;h practice), I &s;hall brie&s;ly ob&s;erve, that
according to the phra&s;eology of the law of Scotland, and
as expounded in the records and proceedings of Court, (cer|tainly
the mo&s;t unexceptionable evidence of the meaning
of any term of law) this of <HI>bani&s;hment</HI> is a broad and ge|neral
term, applicable alike to either mode of exile, by
&s;imple exclu&s;ion from the realm of Scotland, or by convey|ance
to parts abroad, and by confinement there. The terms
<HI>tran&s;port</HI> and <HI>tran&s;portation,</HI> are not native nor proper terms
of the law of Scotland, but a new and foreign &s;tyle, which
has only of late years been borrowed by us from the Engli&s;h
practice, owing to the Briti&s;h &s;tatutes which have a&s;&s;ign|ed
that puni&s;hment for &s;undry o&s;&s;ences, or have regula|ted
the manner of carrying it into effect. As words of
common language, and in the &s;ubordinate and explanatory
parts of &s;entence, which de&s;cribe the method of executing
<PB N="102" REF="103">
the doom, tho&s;e terms were indeed occa&s;ionally u&s;ed; but the
genuine and legitimate &s;tyle of a Scots doom of <HI>deportation,</HI> and
that which always before, and for long after the year 1703
was employed in the <HI>body</HI> of the &s;entence, that part of it
which <HI>decerns</HI> and <HI>ordains</HI> the thing to be done, was invariably
to <HI>bani&s;h,</HI> and not to <HI>tran&s;port.</HI> Thus on the petition of Ja|net

been &s;ettled, that the Court would not depart from it even in
applying tho&s;e Briti&s;h &s;tatutes, which inflict the puni&s;h|ment
of tran&s;portation. On the 27th February 1721, Chri&s;|tie,
Wil&s;on, and Keddy, are indicted for the forcible hin|drance
of a revenue-officer, on a &s;tatute of the 6th of Geo. I.

thereafter the &s;aid &s;entence being by the Lords of his Ma|je&s;ty's
Privy Council commuted to <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> upon an
enactment to depart furth of his Maje&s;ty's dominions to
<HI>America, &s;eparatim,</HI> relevant,&endq; &amp;c. Again; in the record
of the 12th March 1701; we find a recommendation from
the Lords of Privy Council, relative to the execution of
&s;entence of death upon Thomas Ander&s;on and John Weir,
&startq;which &s;entence of death (it &s;ays) was formerly com|muted
and changed <HI>into &s;entence of bani&s;hment furth of
his Maje&s;ty's dominions</HI> by the &s;aid Lords, not to return into
this kingdom under the pain and certification of having
the &s;aid &s;entence of death put to execution again&s;t them.&endq;
It proceeds to relate, that the &s;aid per&s;ons had neverthele&s;s
been found in Scotland, and therefore &startq;the Council have re|voked
and hereby revokes and di&s;charges the fore&s;aid com|mutation
and change of &s;entence from death to <HI>bani&s;h|ment,</HI>
and have remitted,&endq; &amp;c. There follows an order for
putting the &s;entence of death in execution. On the 13th and
17th of the &s;ame mouth, other proceedings take place rela|tive
to the &s;ame per&s;ons, which explain the nature of the <HI>ba|ni&s;hment</HI>
here alluded to. A report had, it &s;eems, been made
to the Privy Council by the Lord Advocate; which report
relates, &startq;That the Lords of Privy Council did alter the
&s;entence of death pronounced again&s;t him (Ander&s;on) to
<HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> not to return under the pain of death, and
that accordingly he was liberate <HI>and &s;ent to Flanders;</HI> but
having returned, and being again apprehended, the &s;aid
Lords of his Maje&s;ty's Privy Council upon the 9th Fe|bruary
<PB N="106" REF="107">
1699, <HI>did bani&s;h him and &s;ome others to his Maje&s;ty's
plantations in America.</HI>&endq; Thus the one entry in the re|cord
explains, that the &s;entence, which in the other is &s;imply
&s;tyled a &s;entence of <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> was truly &s;entence of tran&s;|portation,
fir&s;t to Flanders, (whither he was probably car|ried
to &s;erve as a &s;oldier), and afterwards to the foreign
plantations.</P>
<P>As bani&s;hment was thus the term,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If puni&s;hable with Tran&s;por|tation.</NOTE> which the courts of
law, in 1703, were in the u&s;e of employing when they ad|judged
any one to be tran&s;ported; is it to be imagined, that,
in framing the &s;tatute of that year, which was made for the
preci&s;e purpo&s;e of limiting the puni&s;hment of lea&s;ing-ma|king,
the Legi&s;lature would have made u&s;e of this very term,
if their meaning had been to forbid the inflicting of
tran&s;portation for any &s;uch offence? There &s;eems to be
no ordinary nor probable rule of con&s;truction, under which
this could be held to have been their meaning, if there
were even nothing in the &s;tatute but the bare term of ba|ni&s;hment,
unaccompanied with any other words or provi|&s;ions
to expound it. And far le&s;s is &s;uch a con&s;truc|tion
to be applied in the actual circum&s;tances of this &s;tatute,
whereof the preamble informs us that it was made, becau&s;e
the laws therein recited and altered were &startq;<HI>as to the fore&s;aid
capital puni&s;hment,</HI> of dangerous con&s;equence,&endq; and which
re&s;erves an expre&s;s power to puni&s;h the offender in his per|&s;on,
&startq;<HI>life and limb always pre&s;erved.</HI>&endq; So that according to
the very words of the act, its utmo&s;t &s;cope and purpo&s;e is
to protect the lea&s;ing-maker again&s;t the &s;everity of tho&s;e an|cient
edicts which puni&s;hed him with death.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e con&s;iderations, chiefly two arguments have
been oppo&s;ed. It is &s;aid, that in the &s;tatute 1670, c. 2.
<PB N="107" REF="108">
which authori&s;es tran&s;portation in the ca&s;e there provided
for, that puni&s;hment is de&s;cribed at large, &startq;as bani&s;hment
by &s;ending them to his Maje&s;ty's plantations in the Indies.&endq;
But this one in&s;tance of the employment of a fuller phra&s;e,
and this too in a rigorous law, which is penned throughout
with a plain anxiety to fix matters down again&s;t the delin|quent,
will never outweigh the evidence which ari&s;es from
the ordinary u&s;e of the &s;imple term <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> in that &s;ame
broad &s;en&s;e, in the &s;entences and proceedings of Court.
Still le&s;s will it prove, that &s;uch a &s;pecification was nece&s;&s;ary
in a &s;tatute, which was not made, like the act 1670, to
create a new offence, and a&s;&s;ign its puni&s;hment, but only to
limit the &s;everity of former laws again&s;t an old and known
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, by protecting the delinquent in life and limb.
Accordingly, this con&s;truction has been put upon the term
<HI>bani&s;hment</HI> in the &s;tatute concerning fraudulent bankrupts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1696, c. 3.</NOTE>
which, (with as near an affinity of phra&s;e to the act 1703 as
can be expected to happen in any two laws), appoints them
&startq;to be puni&s;hed by bani&s;hment or otherwi&s;e, death except|ed,
as they &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 26. 1748.</NOTE> Under this &s;tatute, the Lords
of Se&s;&s;ion gave &s;entence, adjudging George and Robert For|re&s;ters
to be bani&s;hed to the plantations<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Acts of Sederunt.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE other argument is founded on the act 1609,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If puni&s;hable with Tran&s;por|tation.</NOTE> c. 9.
one of the &s;tatutes concerning lea&s;ing-makers, which orders
them &startq;to be puni&s;hed by impri&s;onment, <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> fining
or mair rigorous corporal pain.&endq; The&s;e two ordinan|ces,
(it is &s;aid), in 1609 and 1703, being <HI>in pari materia,</HI>
are to be con&s;trued in the &s;ame way; and <HI>bani&s;hment</HI> in
the act 1609 could not po&s;&s;ibly mean <HI>tran&s;portation,</HI> as Scot|land
had not at that time, nor until the end of that cen|tury,
<PB N="108" REF="109">
any colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its own, in which to re|ceive
or confine the convicts. And it is argued, that
without the command of &s;ome &s;uch &s;ettlement there could
be no &s;entence of tran&s;portation, by rea&s;on of the want of
power in any court, to carry its decree into effect in any
place which is out of the bounds of its own juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>THIS, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If puni&s;hable with Tran&s;por|tation.</NOTE> (to pa&s;s over all other an&s;wers<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In particular,&mdash;If tran&s;portation <HI>had</HI> been unknown in 1609, but had come into practice in the cour&s;e of that century, and been invariably known under the &s;tyle of <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> (which we have &s;een was the ca&s;e); mu&s;t not the Legi&s;lature be held to have u&s;ed that term, in the &s;tatute 1703, in its e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;en&s;e <HI>as at that time,</HI> without any regard to the application it had in 1609?</NOTE>), is a
ha&s;ty inference, which has been made without a due re|&s;earch
into facts, and in the ra&s;h confidence, that becau&s;e
the thing could not formerly be done in the preci&s;e form
and fa&s;hion which is known in our days, therefore it could
not be done at all. I learn, on the contrary, from the re|cords
of Court, that tran&s;portation to parts abroad was a
&s;entence known to the Scotti&s;h practice at that very time.</P>

<P>AS this record puts it out of que&s;tion, that tran&s;porta|tion

in the ca&s;e of George Nicol, in 1633, for calumniating the

<P>ON the 2d of February 1636, William and Thomas Mac|kie,
convicted of fal&s;ehood, are in like manner <HI>bani&s;hed</HI>
upon a warrant of Privy Council. After directing them
to be placed in the pillory, the &s;entence proceeds in the&s;e
words: &startq;And that they be returned back by the &s;aid

hour of the &s;aid day, to their &s;aid ward, there to re|main,

to depart, and that within the &s;pace of 40 days,
limited by &s;aid Lords of Secret Council for their removing,
and away pa&s;&s;ing.&endq; The decerning clau&s;e of the &s;entence
is thus: &startq;And to be <HI>bani&s;hed</HI> this kingdom, viz. the &s;aid
William Mackie of Mortoun, during the King's plea&s;ure,
and the &s;aid Thomas Mackie during his lifetime, and ne|ver

<P>ON the 4th April 1637,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If puni&s;hable with Tran&s;por|tation.</NOTE> Janet David&s;on, convicted of adul|tery,

either fore or back part thereof, <HI>and therefra tran&s;portit to

<P>IT would not invalidate the evidence of the&s;e records, al|though,
at this di&s;tance of time, the preci&s;e fa&s;hion could not
be &s;hewn, in which &s;entences of this kind were carried into
effect abroad. The proof would &s;till be unimpeachable, that
in one &s;hape or other the convict was tran&s;ported. But we
have not even this difficulty to contend with. For, from the
&s;ame authentic &s;ource of information, we have the know|ledge
of at lea&s;t one mode of explicating the &s;entence in the
way of confinement and &s;ervitude abroad, not le&s;s effectual,
and even more rigorous, than that which is now in practice.
It was &s;imply thus. In tho&s;e days, the younger &s;ons of the
Scots gentry were &s;oldiers of fortune, in almo&s;t every &s;er|vice
<PB N="113" REF="114">
in Europe; and it appears that they were permitted to
recruit at home. The Ju&s;tice, therefore, to in&s;ure the exe|cution
of his &s;entence of bani&s;hment, had recour&s;e to the
ea&s;y, but &s;ub&s;tantial expedient of adjudging the convicts as
&s;oldiers to tho&s;e officers, to &s;erve them in the foreign wars, and
of taking &s;urety from the officers, (as in later times from the
contractor for tran&s;porting felons), To keep the men abroad,
and employ them in military &s;ervice. For farther &s;ecurity,
the Ju&s;tice added the certification of death, if the bani&s;hed
man &s;hould at any time of his life return to, or be found with|in
the realm of Scotland. It will be proper to &s;tate the evi|dence
of this practice at large, and in the very words of
the record.</P>

<P>UPON the whole of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If puni&s;hable with Tran&s;por|tation.</NOTE> two ob&s;ervations &s;eem to
ari&s;e. 1 <HI>&s;t,</HI> Every ca&s;e that has been quoted, is an additional

<HI>bani&s;hed man;</HI> which we find to have been thus invariably
applied to the per&s;on who was adjudged to be &s;ent <HI>abroad,</HI>
there to continue and &s;erve, whether under his Maje&s;ty or
&s;ome foreign Prince, as an indented &s;oldier <HI>in the foreign
wars. 2 dly,</HI> The&s;e records are evidence, that from an early
period of the 17th century, the puni&s;hment of tran&s;portation
was known to the practice of Scotland, and this in a form
at lea&s;t as &s;ub&s;tantial and &s;evere as at the pre&s;ent day. It
was practi&s;ed too, in the &s;everal forms of &s;entence on con|viction,
and of voluntary enactment, as in later times;
and the doom was attended with the &s;ame certification of
death in ca&s;e of return to Scotland, as under the late&s;t
&s;tatutes of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty. Thus an end is put to the ar|gument,
(an argument in it&s;elf utterly inconclu&s;ive<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See the note, p. 108.</NOTE>), which
has been reared upon the &s;tatute 1609; and it is &s;hown with|al,
that the defect of power in any court, to carry its &s;entence
into execution beyond the bounds of its own territory,
was no hinderance of the &s;ub&s;tantial accompli&s;hment of the
&s;ame object in tho&s;e ancient times, which is now attained in
another way. The truth is, that in all ca&s;es of tran&s;portation
to parts beyond &s;eas, the re&s;traint and confinement which
take place abroad are not, in any proper &s;en&s;e, by the authori|ty
of the court which gives the &s;entence; and this is equally
true of the modern as of the ancient form of carrying the
judgment into effect. All that the &s;entence of the Ju&s;tice
did of old, was lawfully to enli&s;t the convict; to put him as
<PB N="120" REF="121">
a &s;oldier, into the hands of an officer, within this realm of
Scotland, with an order to convey him from thence, accom|panied
with a declaration of the con&s;equence, if ever he
&s;hould again be found within the juri&s;diction of the Court.
The re&s;traint which the man was &s;ubject to on his ar|rival
in the foreign country, was not in virtue of any
dominion of the Ju&s;ticiar of Scotland there, (for he could
pretend to none), but in virtue of the &s;overeignty of the
foreign Prince or State, in who&s;e &s;ervice &s;uch officer was
employed. By the commi&s;&s;ion derived from that impe|rial
authority, the officer was empowered to keep, and to re|&s;train
by military di&s;cipline, all his &s;oldiers and recruits,
of what&s;oever country, regularly engaged to him according
to the law of the land where he procured them. The juri&s;|diction
of the Ju&s;tice was no otherwi&s;e concerned, and his
&s;entence had no farther operation, than by engaging the
man as a &s;oldier here, at home, and thus rendering him a
lawful object of tho&s;e coercive powers abroad, which the
officer derived from quite a &s;eparate and foreign &s;ource.
And ju&s;t &s;o at this day, one who is condemned to
tran&s;portation by the Lords of Ju&s;ticiary, is not confined
in New South Wales upon the mandate and warrant of
that Court, but by the order of his Maje&s;ty and Privy
Council; who, in virtue of the &s;everal &s;tatutes enacted in
that behalf, have power to name his place of de&s;tination,
and to detain and employ in labour there, (through the
medium of the contractors with the per&s;ons by them au|thori&s;ed),
&s;uch convicts as have &s;entence for tran&s;port|able
crimes. The power which confines and employs
the felon abroad, is therefore the controlling power of the
Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature over the colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions belonging to
the kingdom. The authority of the Court, whether Scots
<PB N="121" REF="122">
or Engli&s;h, which adjudges him to be tran&s;ported, is no
farther exerted than by rendering him a lawful object of
tho&s;e powers, with which, by &s;tatute, his Maje&s;ty (with the
advice of his Privy Council) has been inve&s;ted. His ca&s;e, in
&s;hort, is like that of a vagabond who is <HI>comprehended</HI> (as it
is called), and made a &s;oldier under one of tho&s;e occa&s;ional
&s;tatutes which are pa&s;&s;ed for the more &s;peedy recruiting of
his Maje&s;ty's forces. By the &s;entence of the Ju&s;tices of
Peace, proceeding upon &s;uch a &s;tatute, the vagabond is made
a &s;oldier, in like manner, and as effectually, as if he were
voluntarily to inli&s;t. And here the exertion of their autho|rity
ends. The peculiarities of the man's condition after|wards,
are the operation of the mutiny act, which attaches
upon all per&s;ons who in this or any other way have lawfully
been engaged as &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>THAT this &s;ort of puni&s;hment was introduced under autho|rity
of the Privy Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If puni&s;hable with Tran&s;por|tation.</NOTE> and was chiefly applied at fir&s;t to
ca&s;es in them&s;elves of a capital nature, nowi&s;e invalidates the
inference which is made from the&s;e memorials of our ancient
practice. In truth, this was the cour&s;e in that age, with almo&s;t
every thing of either a new or an extraordinary nature, in
the economy of the realm of Scotland. In particular, be&s;ide
a peculiar juri&s;diction of their own, the Privy Council then
enjoyed an undi&s;puted and con&s;tant &s;uperintendence of what|&s;oever
related to the admini&s;tration of criminal ju&s;tice; and
were in the u&s;e of frequent intercour&s;e and con&s;ultation
with the Ju&s;tice and his deputes, concerning any thing of
difficulty or importance that occurred in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the
Court. Nay, it was even declared by &s;tatute 1584, c. 129.
that the King and Council were Judges competent to all
per&s;ons, and in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. How improper &s;oever
<PB N="122" REF="123">
any &s;uch control or interference in more regular and or|derly
times, this was the rule and cu&s;tom, the fixed and ac|knowledged
law, of that period. And, becau&s;e in the arbi|trary
reigns of Charles II. and James VII. many unju&s;t and
cruel things were done by the Coun&s;ellors of tho&s;e Princes in
Scotland, (for which their memory is &s;till attended with
the de&s;erved reproach); it will not follow that the Privy
Councils of all former times are to be involved in the
&s;ame cen&s;ure; &s;till le&s;s that every proceeding which at
any period originated with the Privy Council, as the Su|preme
Criminal Judicature of the land, is therefore to
be expunged from the law, though afterwards adopted
into the practice of the ordinary courts of ju&s;tice, and
&s;anctified by their u&s;age, and by the uniform acquie&s;|cence
of the country, in all later ages. Indeed, it appears
from the precedents quoted, of which &s;even are without any
warrant from the Privy Council, that as early as the time
of Charles I. the Ju&s;tice and his deputes had begun to fol|low
the example of that body, (who had always &s;poken
through the Ju&s;tice-court as an organ); and thus by degrees,
the puni&s;hment of tran&s;portation became part of the com|mon
and undoubted law of the land.</P>
<P>IT has,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If puni&s;hable with Tran&s;por|tation.</NOTE> however, been objected, that &s;till it has become
&s;o under certain modifications, and with re&s;pect only to
crimes of a certain cla&s;s, namely, &s;uch as by the law of
Scotland are in them&s;elves puni&s;hable with death It has
been affirmed that our records do not afford a &s;ingle in&s;tance
of tran&s;portation, (unle&s;s it were voluntary), for any crime
of a lower degree.</P>
<P>IF the fact were even &s;o; yet &s;till, if it be true, that, ac|cording
to a ju&s;t con&s;truction of the term <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> it is equi|valent
<PB N="123" REF="124">
to <HI>tran&s;portation,</HI> no inference could thence be made
towards the deci&s;ion of this debate. We &s;hould &s;till have
the expre&s;s authority of the act 1703, to u&s;e tran&s;portation
as a puni&s;hment for this particular offence. But in truth,
it is rather to be wondered at, that an a&s;&s;ertion &s;hould ever
have been hazarded, which would go to expunge at one
&s;troke a very large portion of the books of adjournal; &s;o nu|merous
are the in&s;tances of tran&s;portation applied to offences
which are not puni&s;hable with death, and which are not
by any &s;tatute made liable to bani&s;hment or tran&s;portation.
The crime of mobbing was puni&s;hed in that way in the
ca&s;e of Fairney and Turnbull, Augu&s;t 9. 1720; of James
Falconer and Janet Hill, October 6. 1725; of Buchanan, Ha|milton,
Macfarlane, and Mitchell, October 15. 1725; of
Gilchri&s;t, March 9. 1741; of Richard Robert&s;on, in March
1773; of Fra&s;er, July 26. 1784; of Paul and Ander&s;on,
Augu&s;t 24. 1784; of Macgrigor, Augu&s;t 2. 1784.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame puni&s;hment was applied to the crime of wound|ing
with intent to kill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If puni&s;hable with Tran&s;por|tation.</NOTE> in the ca&s;e of Alexander Sime, De|cember
16. 1754; of John Ogilvy, March 8. 1756; and
Thomas Young, July 11. 1771. As al&s;o, to the crime of &s;olicit|ing
others to rai&s;e fire, in the ca&s;e of William and Alexander
Fra&s;er, November 4. and 14. 1720; to the ca&s;e of defective
proof of murder, Bi&s;&s;et and Currier, June 1705; to the crime
of &s;ending letters to extort money, in the ca&s;e of John Fra|&s;er,
March 19. 20. 1759, and of James Gray in June, July
1737; to the crime of &s;windling, in the ca&s;e of James
Grahame, July 31. 1786, and of Thomas Hall, July 20.
1789; to the crime of fal&s;ehood and con&s;piracy again&s;t a
per&s;on's fame, in the ca&s;e of Campbell of Burnbank in March
1721; to the crime of vitiating writings, (by &s;entence of the
<PB N="124" REF="125">
Court of Se&s;&s;ion); in the ca&s;e of William Dunbar, February
26. 1762; to the coining of halfpence, in the ca&s;e of William
Deane, October 6. and November 4. 1729, (which offence the
Court had previou&s;ly found relevant only to infer an arbitrary
puni&s;hment); to the crime of forcible abduction and marriage,
in the ca&s;e of Thomas Gray in July 1751. The&s;e in&s;tances
may &s;u&s;&s;ice as a &s;pecimen of the tenor of our practice in this
particular. In point of wickedne&s;s, and of danger, &s;ome of
the offences thus puni&s;hed with tran&s;portation, are inferior
to that of lea&s;ing-making; and &s;o far is the practice of Scot|land
from refu&s;ing to li&s;ten to any argument of analogy or
compari&s;on in &s;uch matters, (which &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed to be
the ca&s;e), that, even where a crime is entirely new, and has
never before been the &s;ubject of trial, &s;till our Judges have
the undoubted power, and are in the u&s;e, of applying &s;uch
a remedy to it, not excepting tran&s;portation, as the nature
and degree of the evil &s;eem to require.</P>
<P>IN the clo&s;e of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If puni&s;hable with Tran&s;por|tation.</NOTE> it has been urged, that at lea&s;t in prac|tice,
the act 1703 has not been con&s;trued to warrant tran&s;por|tation;
&s;eeing that on no occa&s;ion &s;ince the date of the act has
lea&s;ing-making been puni&s;hed in that way. But this, if it
were true, would only prove that no ca&s;e has occurred in later
times; where the offender has been thought de&s;erving of &s;o
rigorous a judgment; as indeed neither has any ca&s;e hap|pened,
where &s;entence has been given for even &s;imple ba|ni&s;hment
from Scotland. But though this be true with re|&s;pect
to &s;imple bani&s;hment, the fact is otherwi&s;e as to tran&s;|portation.
For in the ca&s;e, already mentioned, of David
Baillie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 4. 1704.</NOTE> a ca&s;e tried within a few months after the pa&s;&s;ing of
the act 1703, and in which the libel concluded for the pains of
this very &s;tatute, the&s;e were held by the Judges of that time,
<PB N="125" REF="126">
(certainly better qualified than we to interpret the language
of their own days), to extend to tran&s;portation; and he ac|cordingly
had &s;entence of <HI>bani&s;hment to the plantations.</HI> It is
true, that on petition to Parliament, the execution of this
&s;entence was &s;u&s;pended; but it does not appear that any mi&s;|con&s;truction
of the law, in this particular, was among the
rea&s;ons alleged for revi&s;al of the proceedings.</P>
<P>I HAVE now &s;poken of this matter &s;omewhat more fully
than I once intended, or than the value or curio&s;ity of the
que&s;tion, in it&s;elf, may &s;eem to de&s;erve. But for this I have
had other, more intere&s;ting, and I tru&s;t, not unworthy mo|tives,
be&s;ide the de&s;ire of elucidating a point of law. Cer|tainly
I &s;hall not think the digre&s;&s;ion mi&s;placed, nor my
pains thrown away, if, in any degree, I &s;hall contribute to
prevent tho&s;e fal&s;e and injurious impre&s;&s;ions with re&s;pect to
the admini&s;tration of criminal ju&s;tice in Scotland, which the
indu&s;trious, and too curious agitation of this controver&s;y,
has been calculated to occa&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF PERJURY.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now &s;poken of the principal offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI.</NOTE> which are
to the injury of individuals in per&s;on, fame, or property.
And, according to the method which was marked out in the
introduction of this work, I &s;hall now be led to inquire con|cerning
&s;uch tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions as are chiefly vindicated on ac|count
of their pernicious tendency with re&s;pect to the pub|lic
polity, and general welfare of the realm. The&s;e may be
di&s;tributed into &s;everal cla&s;&s;es,&mdash;as they are injurious to the
admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice; to the con&s;ervation of peace;
to public order, police, and economy; to the intere&s;ts of
trade; to the rights of the King and his government; or to
the reverence of God and of religion.</P>
<P>I. AMONG tho&s;e offences which are ho&s;tile to the cour&s;e of
ju&s;tice, that which may &s;eem to challenge the fir&s;t rank,
(though perhaps among the lower orders of people reputed
more venial than many others, but for that very rea&s;on &s;o
much the more nece&s;&s;ary to be diligently inquired after),
is the crime of Perjury, or the judicial affirmation of fal&s;e|hood
upon oath. For, be&s;ide the magnitude of this tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="127" REF="128">
in a religious point of view,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PERJURY.</NOTE> (which is &s;uch that in
all ages and countries the religon of an oath has been held
to bind even to a &s;tranger or an enemy), it de&s;troys the &s;e|curity
of all manner of rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and thus tends
to defeat the great ends of law and government, and even
to unloo&s;e the bonds of &s;ociety among men.</P>
<P>1. THE &s;ub&s;tance of the crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A plain Fal&s;e|hood mu&s;t be &s;aid.</NOTE> and that which all the
other particulars in the de&s;cription of it only modify and
limit is, that a plain fal&s;ehood be explicitly and wilfully
affirmed. For, if either there is any doubt about the true
&s;tate of the fact, or about the &s;en&s;e in which the pannel's
words are to be under&s;tood; or if they can in any rea&s;on|able
way be reconciled with the truth, or with an innocent
intention; or, in general, if it is not manife&s;t and obvious,
but matter of likelihood only, and of inference and com|pari&s;on
of many particulars, that he had a fal&s;e and corrupt
meaning, this &s;hall &s;ave him from the accu&s;ation of perjury.
Indeed, it would be very dangerous to convict any one up|on
&s;uch con&s;tructive grounds; con&s;idering the imperfection of
language, and the &s;till more imperfect u&s;e which &s;o many
per&s;ons have of it, and how unequal their degrees of intelli|gence
in the affairs of life, and even their degrees of capa|city
for the ob&s;ervation of facts.</P>
<P>THIS &s;crupulous and equitable caution was in particular
ob&s;erved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A plain Fal&s;e|hood mu&s;t be &s;aid.</NOTE> in deciding on the relevancy of the libel again&s;t
Archibald Mackillop.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 13. and Nov. 18. &amp; 25. 1754.</NOTE> This man had been a witne&s;s in the
trial of certain per&s;ons for a violent deforcement of the re|venue-officers,
and had given a te&s;timony, which in many
points was very favourable to the pannels. Among other
things, he had &s;worn, that they addre&s;&s;ed the revenue-officers
<PB N="128" REF="129">
in a moderate and inoffen&s;ive manner, &startq;de&s;iring them to
walk &s;oberly, and to make no di&s;turbance.&endq; Now, in this
article, be&s;ide others, he was charged with perjury; in as
much (&s;aid the libel) as it will be proved, that the per&s;ons
accu&s;ed went violently up to the officers, demanded their
arms, and threatened to blow them up, if they re&s;i&s;ted. It
was pleaded for the pannel, that the two a&s;&s;ertions were not
ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent; for that in &s;wearing to the one &s;ort
of addre&s;s and cour&s;e of behaviour, he did not ab&s;olutely
exclude the other, which might be u&s;ed at a different period
of the fray, and without his attending to it at the time.
The Court, accordingly, in their interlocutor of relevancy,
made an exception of this article of the charge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;November 18. 1754. But find the allegation in the &s;econd article of the &s;aid indictment charged in the&s;e words: &startq;That the pannel &s;wore that at the time there mentioned, the &s;aid James Mackindie de&s;ired the &s;aid Alexander Cook and Alexander Thom&s;on to walk &s;oberly, and make no di&s;turbance;&endq; not relevant, and refu&s;e to admit the &s;ame to probation; and repel the haill other defences and exceptions proponed again&s;t the &s;aid indictment.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame doctrine is farther confirmed by the judgment
in the ca&s;e of Robert Orrock;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A plain Fal&s;e|hood mu&s;t be &s;aid.</NOTE> who had &s;worn as arre&s;tee, in
a proce&s;s of forthcoming,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 10. &amp; 24. 1711.</NOTE> that he owed Craig, the common
debtor, &s;uch a &s;um by bond, and &s;o much more as the $$|$$due
of the price of malt. In truth, he al&s;o owed Craig a
farther &s;um by bill. But he an&s;wered to the charge of per|jury,
that, &s;tanding as it did, his oath proved a greater debt
than that for which the arre&s;tment had been u&s;ed, and that,
having e&s;tabli&s;hed this again&s;t him&s;elf, he conceived that he
had &s;ub&s;tantially exhau&s;ted the reference to his oath; &s;o
that in truth there was no prejudice from the omi&s;&s;ion, either
real or intended. The bill too, (he added), might be omit|ted
<PB N="129" REF="130">
from inadvertency, &s;ince no &s;pecial que&s;tion was a&s;ked
about it; as well as, for aught he knew, Craig might have
indor&s;ed the bill to another per&s;on, who, and not Craig,
would in that ca&s;e have been his creditor. The Court found

2. THE fal&s;ehood mu&s;t be affirmed ab&s;olutely. That is
to &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fal&s;ehood mu&s;t be &s;aid ab|&s;olutely.</NOTE> the pannel &s;hall not be chargeable with perjury, if
he has &s;worn doubtfully, or according to his belief or recol|lection
only, and with relation to &s;uch things, about which,
from their di&s;tant date or otherwi&s;e, he might naturally be
uncertain. For with this limitation any &s;uch doctrine mu&s;t
always be under&s;tood; as it is not to be imagined that a per|&s;on
may incur the guilt, and yet avoid the pains of perjury,
by the thin device of adding this cautious but unmeaning
quality to his oath, when relative to things to of which he could
not but have a full knowledge, and an accurate remembrance.
In the ca&s;e of George Montgomery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 28. 1715. Jan. 19. 1716.</NOTE> this defence was accor|dingly,

and fini&s;ter purpo&s;e, re&s;olves to conceal it. This circum&s;tance
mu&s;t, therefore, be affirmed in the libel; in like manner as
it mu&s;t be affirmed in a libel for re&s;et of theft, that the pan|nel
received the goods, knowing them to be &s;tolen. Owing
to an omi&s;&s;ion in this re&s;pect, the charge was found irrele|vant
in the ca&s;e of Gabriel Halliday, in February 1767<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Maclaurin, No. 75.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is a con&s;equence of this principle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath of Calum|ny or Lawbur|rows, does it ground charge of Perjury?</NOTE> that there can be
no pro&s;ecution for perjury, in certain ca&s;es where the oath
is pure matter of opinion and belief, in which the law
means ab&s;olutely to tru&s;t the per&s;on &s;wearing, and leave him
an&s;werable only to his own con&s;cience; or with re&s;pect to
which, from the very nature of the thing, no conclu&s;ive
evidence can be obtained of his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the fal&s;e|hood.
The oath which comes neare&s;t to this de&s;cription, is
the oath of calumny: becau&s;e, how groundle&s;s &s;oever the
proce&s;s may &s;eem to all the world but the pur&s;uer; yet po&s;|&s;ibly
to him, under the influence of all the prejudices which
mi&s;lead a per&s;on in his own cau&s;e, it might appear to be &s;uch
a proce&s;s as he had good rea&s;on to bring, and to expect to pre|vail
in. Perhaps, too, it is in the true nature of this pro|vi&s;ion
of the law, entirely and ultimately to re&s;t the matter
upon the per&s;on's con&s;cience, and no farther to re&s;train the
freedom of pro&s;ecution, than may be done by this &s;afe and
&s;imple expedient. Another illu&s;tration is the oath (as it is
called) <HI>in lawburrows;</HI> with re&s;pect to which, be the ap|prehen&s;ion
of harm ever &s;o chimerical and ab&s;urd, it &s;till
<PB N="133" REF="134">
might be genuine and unaffected in the per&s;on who made
oath to that effect, and can &s;carcely, in any imaginable
way of evidence, be proved to have been otherwi&s;e. Be|&s;ides;
it may be doubted whether the law intends that any
one who will take this oath, which has the effect only of
binding the party complained of more particularly to that
cour&s;e of conduct which he is at any rate obliged to ob|&s;erve,
&s;hall be any farther que&s;tioned re&s;pecting the reality
of his fears. The exception will, however, go no farther,
than to the few ca&s;es of this de&s;cription.</P>
<P>IT is another con&s;equence of the &s;ame principle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath mu&s;t be material to the Matter at I&s;&s;ue.</NOTE> that the
oath, in that part of it which is challenged as fal&s;e, mu&s;t
be pertinent and material to the point at i&s;&s;ue. Meaning
by this, that it mu&s;t relate to &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial facts,
which may have influence in the deci&s;ion of the intere&s;t
that is at &s;take, in the proceeding where the oath is made. As
to minute or in&s;ignificant particulars, &s;uch as could neither
be &s;uppo&s;ed much to attract the attention of the per&s;on &s;wear|ing,
nor to affect the opinion of tho&s;e who had to judge of
his oath; any error in the&s;e will not be a&s;cribed to malice,
but to the more natural and excu&s;able cau&s;e of inadverten|cy,
or imperfect recollection, or the like.</P>
<P>THE fal&s;ehood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fal&s;ehood mu&s;t be on Oath.</NOTE> circum&s;tanced as has been &s;aid in point of
&s;ub&s;tance, mu&s;t farther, in point of form, be affirmed upon
oath; in contempt of that high pre&s;ence and &s;olemn ad|juration,
which ought mo&s;t powerfully to impre&s;s the per&s;on
with the awe of his duty: So that he only can be brought to
the bar for perjury, who is hardened again&s;t all reverence of
God, as well as all &s;en&s;e of obligation towards his neighbour.
The mo&s;t formal, and even written <HI>declaration,</HI> is not there|fore
<PB N="134" REF="135">
a &s;ufficient ground of pro&s;ecution. Probably this
might be one rea&s;on, (but the interlocutor is in general
terms), why the libel was found not relevant in the ca&s;e of
James Robert&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 19. 1709.</NOTE> who was charged with perjury, (among
other offences),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 23. 1710.</NOTE> as having, on occa&s;ion of a certain poll-tax,
&s;olemnly <HI>declared</HI> that his means and e&s;tate did not amount
to 500 merks; whereas, he afterwards, in a proce&s;s of &s;puil|zie

much greater amount<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>&startq;The Lords find the libel, as libelled upon the in&s;tructions produced, com|pared and con&s;idered by their Lord&s;hips, not relevant.&endq;</P>
<P>This objection was al&s;o &s;tated to the libel again&s;t Margaret Wood, (Februa|ry 23. 1631), as far as concerned her declaration of the 9th December, before the Privy Council, which &s;he had afterwards contradicted upon oath; but none of the points in that ca&s;e were decided.</P>
<P>On the 4th Augu&s;t 1777, Patrick Maccurly was indicted for perjury upon the&s;e grounds. He had been precogno&s;ced in the view of a criminal trial, and had gi|ven a declaration very unfavourable to the accu&s;ed. On the trial he retracted this, and gave a &s;trong te&s;timony in favour of the pannel, who, in con&s;equence was acquitted. Towards the end of his depo&s;ition, he was a&s;ked, Whether he had ever, on any former occa&s;ion, given a different account of the matter? And he &s;wore that he had not. The charge of perjury was laid upon this an&s;wer; but after debate, and an order for informations, the diet was, on the 27th November, de&s;erted. It was one &s;trong objection to this charge, that the que&s;tion put to him on the trial, with reference to his declaration, &s;eems to have been improper, and &s;uch as he was not obliged to an&s;wer.</P></NOTE>. Farther; though the affirmation
approach more nearly to the re&s;emblance of an oath, as
in the ca&s;e of one, who in declaring before a Magi&s;trate,
&s;hall of his own accord, call God to witne&s;s the truth of his
&s;tory, and &s;hall imprecate cur&s;es on his head if he have told
a fal&s;ehood; yet &s;till there is no proper indictable perjury.
For this is not an oath, nor a part of the record, nor of the
<PB N="135" REF="136">
proceeding of the Magi&s;trate, but a &s;udden and intemperate
effu&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ion of the man; to which, how &s;inful &s;o|ever,
the law will not attach the temporal con&s;equences of
perjury, by rea&s;on of the precipitate, unguarded, and unnece&s;|&s;ary
manner, in which the thing is done.</P>
<P>THE only exceptions to this rule, are in the ca&s;e of Peers,
who&s;e privilege it is to be tru&s;ted in certain ca&s;es upon their
word of honour; and of Quakers, whom the &s;tatute 22d
Geo. II. c. 46. allows, in all civil matters, to give their &s;o|lemn
affirmation in&s;tead of their oath; but under the expre&s;s
provi&s;ion of being liable to the pains of perjury, in ca&s;e of
fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>5. THE oath mu&s;t be given before &s;ome Magi&s;trate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath mu&s;t be before one ha|ving right to take it.</NOTE> offi|cer,
or other per&s;on, who has right and authority by law to
exact or receive an oath in that matter. If it be only taken
in the hands of &s;ome private per&s;on, though in the proper
and judicial words, it has neither that &s;olemnity of proceed|ing,
(to &s;ay nothing of the uncertainty of proof), which is
pre&s;umed to put the per&s;on making oath upon his guard;
nor is it attended with any of tho&s;e con&s;equences in point
of intere&s;t to the man him&s;elf, nor of prejudice to his neigh|bour,
which are the proofs of the determined malice of the
offender's heart, and which chiefly, and not &s;o much the im|morality
of the fal&s;ehood, are con&s;idered by the law, in
di&s;pen&s;ing the pains of perjury. By parity of rea&s;on, no
account ought to be had in this que&s;tion, of a voluntary
<HI>affidavit</HI> made to facts before a Magi&s;trate; which is at
lea&s;t an u&s;ele&s;s, or rather an improper practice, on this, if
on no other account, that it tends to le&s;&s;en the reverence
of an oath, by the free employment of it at plea&s;ure of the
party, on every frivolous occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">
I KNOW not whether it is farther to be under&s;tood, that
the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t the Oath he before a ci|vil Court?</NOTE> or per&s;on before whom the oath is taken, mu&s;t be
one who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is of a civil, and not of a clerical nature.
The law, it may be &s;aid, ought to interpo&s;e to puni&s;h tho&s;e
perjuries only which interfere with temporal intere&s;ts, or
are violations of civil order, and will leave &s;uch as happen
in the cour&s;e of eccle&s;ia&s;tical proceedings, to be cha&s;ti&s;ed
with tho&s;e &s;piritual cen&s;ures, which are the proper weapons
of that department. Be&s;ides, it may be doubted how far
the oath will be proved by the record of the Spiritual Court.
I find, however, one in&s;tance of a per&s;on puni&s;hed for a
fal&s;e oath which was given in a court of pre&s;bytery. On
the 25th April 1601, William Barclay was indicted for
hearing ma&s;s, as al&s;o for perjury; having &s;worn before
the Pre&s;bytery of Edinburgh, that he was of the Pre&s;by|terian
faith, and having afterwards attended twice at ma&s;s.
He came in the King's will; was bani&s;hed for the hearing
of ma&s;s, and declared infamous, and incapable of office, for
the perjury.</P>
<P>6. THE oath mu&s;t not only be taken before the proper officer,
but al&s;o in the due and accu&s;tomed form,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath mu&s;t be in the ordinay Form, and com|plete.</NOTE> in the department
of bu&s;ine&s;s to which it relates. Whereby, if it is not re|duced
into writing, as by law or cu&s;tom required in that
matter; or, in ca&s;e of an oath of witne&s;s or of party, if it
is omitted to be read over before &s;igning, (but this the pan|nel
has to prove); or if, being read over, it is omitted to
be &s;igned; or if, upon reading, the per&s;on retracts and re|fu&s;es
to &s;ign, and is therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; in all the&s;e &s;itua|tions
the law will not under&s;tand that a perjury is commit|ted.
In &s;ome of them, becau&s;e there is not a fini&s;hed and
ultimate affirmation of fal&s;ehood, adhered to on reflexion,
and at the peril of the deponent; and in others, becau&s;e the
bu&s;ine&s;s has not been conducted with that deliberation and
<PB N="137" REF="138">
regularity, which, if they had been u&s;ed, might have deter|red
the party, or have induced him to retract or explain, be|fore
retiring from the pre&s;ence of the Judge. Be&s;ides, in
the ca&s;e of the party not having &s;igned his depo&s;ition, (being
a per&s;on who can write), it is not duly authenticated to be
his, nor to be accurately taken down; and it cannot therefore
be made a ground of charge again&s;t him. In confirmation of
this opinion, Mackenzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Perjury, No. 7.</NOTE> has cited the ca&s;e of Mr James
Row. But though there &s;eems to be little doubt of the
&s;oundne&s;s of his doctrine, yet it has not the authority of
any judgment that was given in the trial of that ca&s;e. For,
on examination of the &s;everal debates and interlocutors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 2. &amp; 9. 1665.</NOTE> it
appears that the Ju&s;tice proceeded on the &s;ingle ground

&s;peech be &s;aid to be perjured; as certainly their guilt is
in &s;ome mea&s;ure allied to that of the per&s;on who &s;wears
fal&s;ely. Yet it is different too; in as much as it does not
lie in affirming a fal&s;ehood upon oath, nor even in the fal&s;ely
confirming a promi&s;e with that a&s;&s;urance, (&s;ince the per&s;on,
at the time, may have been &s;incere in what he profe&s;&s;ed),
but in breaking or forgetting the oath which he has taken.
The crime, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, does not exi&s;t, (as it does in every
in&s;tance of proper perjury), at the time of the judicial and
&s;olemn act, but is made out by comparing the oath with
the conduct of the man afterwards. In both in&s;tances, the
obligation of an oath is indeed contemned, but it is in diffe|rent
ways. The one offender &s;wears a fal&s;e oath, and calls
upon his Maker to be witne&s;s of the corruption of his heart;
the other is in the event only fal&s;e, or faithle&s;s (I rather
ought to &s;ay) to his engagement, undertaken in that &s;olemn
manner.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame an&s;wer may re&s;olve the que&s;tion which is agi|tated
in Mackenzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Perjury, No. 3.</NOTE>, concerning promi&s;&s;ory vows and oaths,
relative to performance of facts or pecuniary obligations;
with this farther difference in favour of the offender, that he
may not have performance in his power, and that circum|&s;tances
may even happen, which will affect the obligation
after the time when fir&s;t it is contracted.</P>
<P>IN this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Do contrary Oaths infer Per|jury?</NOTE> mention may al&s;o be made of the ca&s;e of
contrary depo&s;itions, emitted by the &s;ame per&s;on at different

which he had formerly &s;worn to, of the &s;ame matter, or re|tracts
his fir&s;t depo&s;ition, and confe&s;&s;es on oath that it was
<PB N="139" REF="140">
fal&s;e. That in this &s;ituation, he may be pro&s;ecuted for
the fal&s;ehood of the fir&s;t oath, if the true &s;tate of the fact
can be &s;hown; and that his &s;econd depo&s;ition may be u&s;ed
as a <HI>circum&s;tance</HI> of evidence, (and a &s;trong one it certainly
is), to prove the fal&s;ehood of the former; cannot be doubted.
But that, without inquiry concerning the true &s;tate of facts,
or any affirmation made on that head, indictment &s;hall lie
for perjury, on the bare face of the two depo&s;itions as con|tradictory,
and as <HI>one or other of them</HI> nece&s;&s;arily fal&s;e; this
is a different and more debateable po&s;ition. For it &s;eems e&s;|&s;ential
to every charge of fal&s;e oath or perjury, that it &s;et
forth as well what the truth is, as the fal&s;ehood that has
been affirmed; which indeed cannot any otherwi&s;e appear to
be a fal&s;ehood, than by its oppo&s;ition to the verity of the ca&s;e,
as it &s;hall be proved. Here, on the contrary, a conviction
would be &s;ought, not of any ab&s;olute or certain &s;tate of facts,
but, (of which I know no example in the law), in a hypo|thetical
or alternative form, that by one or other of the&s;e
oaths, (but which of the two the libel does not even de&s;ire the
jury to find nor to inquire), a perjury has been committed.
Neither, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, have the jury any certainty or &s;uffi|cient
warrant even of that conclu&s;ion; &s;ince for aught that
needs be proved to them on &s;uch a libel, both depo&s;itions may
be equally fal&s;e. The nature, therefore, of &s;uch an offence,
&s;eems to be rather a prevarication or contradiction upon
oath, in like manner as if it happened in the cour&s;e of a
&s;ingle depo&s;ition. Yet I am obliged to acknowledge, that
according to the a&s;pect of the&s;e ca&s;es,&mdash;that of Galbraith,
July 10. 1605,&mdash;of James Bayne, March 10. 1620,&mdash;and of
Andrew Turnbull, June 22. 1622,&mdash;there &s;eems rea&s;on to
believe, that in tho&s;e days this &s;ort of vacillancy was

this footing, as far as I can di&s;cover, the conviction went,
and this was the notion taken up by the lawyers of tho&s;e
times), the &s;econd depo&s;ition, a&s;&s;irming the fal&s;ehood of the
former, was held to be complete evidence to that effect,
and of it&s;elf, a &s;ufficient authority to condemn. I doubt if
it would now be regarded in any other light, than as a cir|cum&s;tance
or pre&s;umption in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>8. UNDER the qualifications which have been mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fal&s;e Oath of any &s;ort infers Perjury.</NOTE>
the crime of perjury &s;eems to be applicable in our practice
to fal&s;e oaths of every de&s;cription. The mo&s;t favourable
ca&s;e, however, to the pro&s;ecutor, and that which admits the
mo&s;t deci&s;ive evidence, is where the oath is <HI>&s;uper facto pro|prio:</HI>
as if a witne&s;s have &s;worn, that on &s;uch a day he was
at &s;uch a place, or that certain things were done by him at
&s;uch a time and place; whereas it can be proved that he
was then el&s;ewhere, at a great di&s;tance, and differently em|ployed.
A charge of this &s;ort was &s;u&s;tained again&s;t James
Wil&s;on, Augu&s;t 13. 1768. This man had &s;worn in a trial in
Exchequer, that at a certain time he was on the Stirling-hill
near Peterhead, and &s;aw from thence a certain ve&s;&s;el in a par|ticular
&s;ituation, which he de&s;cribed. The libel charged, that
he was not at that time upon the Stirling-hill, nor even a&s;hore,
but aboard a ve&s;&s;el, and at &s;ea, and &s;o &s;ituated as not to be
within the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eeing the &s;hip in que&s;tion. The
libel was found relevant; but the pannel had a verdict in
his favour. It would be another in&s;tance of the &s;ame cla&s;s,
if a per&s;on examined as a witne&s;s <HI>in initialibus,</HI> &s;hould fal&s;ely
<PB N="141" REF="142">
deny his relation to the party who has cited him; or, having
taken a bribe for his evidence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 28. 1715.</NOTE> if he &s;wear that he has got
no reward.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 19. 1716.</NOTE> Or again, if any one &s;hould deny any recent
and &s;olemn promi&s;e or engagement of his own; as in the
ca&s;e already cited, of George Montgomery.</P>
<P>BUT perjury may equally be committed, though the proof
of it is more difficult, by depo&s;ition <HI>&s;uper facto alieno.</HI> As if
a witne&s;s &s;wear, that at &s;uch a time and place he &s;aw John

and others, who were then and there pre&s;ent with the
pannel, and as advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated as he to know the
truth, that no &s;ort of violence happened on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>FARTHER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fal&s;e Oath of Party in&s;ers Per|jury.</NOTE> (though this among the foreign commentators

equally be maintained for perjury, again&s;t one who &s;wears
upon reference as a party, as again&s;t a witne&s;s. The truth
is, that there is far more need of a &s;trong re&s;traint upon a
party &s;wearing, who lies under a &s;trong temptation to be
fal&s;e in his own favour, than upon a witne&s;s, who in ge|neral
has no intere&s;t of his own depending on the i&s;&s;ue;
and to remove the dread of puni&s;hment, on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion,
would be to de&s;troy one of the great &s;ecurities which
men have in this way of terminating litigation. Be&s;ides;
nothing can ju&s;tly be held to be tran&s;acted by the reference
to oath, but the particular intere&s;t which is at &s;take in the
proceedings where the reference is made. However manife&s;t
the fal&s;ehood of the depo&s;ition, yet &s;till, as far as concerns
<PB N="142" REF="143">
that intere&s;t, it is ab&s;olutely conclu&s;ive of the controver&s;y,
and can by no other, even the mo&s;t deci&s;ive evidence, be
controled; nor indeed, will the ca&s;e be altered in that re|&s;pect,
to the di&s;advantage of the party &s;wearing, even after
his conviction of the perjury in a criminal Court; &startq;<HI>Stari

cannot deprive the private party, and far le&s;s the public
pro&s;ecutor, over who&s;e rights the private party has no
power, of his title and intere&s;t to vindicate the &s;candalous
and public wrong. Nay, the private party has the &s;tronger
intere&s;t for this very rea&s;on, that he has &s;uffered a wrong by
the perjury, which cannot be repaired. This di&s;tinction is
clearly indicated in the&s;e texts of the Roman law, L. 21. <HI>&amp;

on the &s;ame que&s;tion; and in the ca&s;e of Mr Row,

worthy to be &s;tirred.</P>
<P>THERE &s;eems rea&s;on to doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Does Oath of Party in a Cri|minal Proce&s;s?</NOTE> (but no ca&s;e has happened
to elucidate the que&s;tion), whether any exception can be ad|mitted
<PB N="143" REF="144">
to this rule, even in the ca&s;e of oath upon reference
in a criminal pro&s;ecution. In the modern practice (perhaps it
was not &s;o fully &s;ettled in the ancient), no &s;uch reference is al|lowed
to be made, unle&s;s in tho&s;e ca&s;es of tre&s;pa&s;s or delin|quency,
where the conclu&s;ions are not of that high or per|&s;onal
nature, from which any &s;trong temptation to perjury
can be pre&s;umed to ari&s;e. Now, as it is on this account that
the law &s;u&s;tains the tran&s;action of an oath in the&s;e &s;ituations;
&s;o it mu&s;t deem the per&s;on criminal and inexcu&s;able, who
gives way to the &s;eduction of &s;o low an intere&s;t.</P>
<P>BESIDE the oath of party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath of Party infers it, tho$$$ not on reference.</NOTE> which is taken upon reference in
a law-&s;uit, there are many others, competent to be proffered
to a party, or for &s;ecurity required to be taken by him on
particular occa&s;ions; and in all the&s;e &s;ituations al&s;o, he
equally &s;wears under the peril of the pains of perjury, in ca&s;e
of fal&s;ehood. To this cla&s;s belongs the oath of bribery, and
of tru&s;t and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at elections; a debtor's oath to obtain
the benefit of the act of grace; a &s;u&s;pender's oath at pa&s;&s;ing
his bill upon juratory caution; the oath at obtaining decree
of <HI>ce&s;&s;io bonorum,</HI> or a di&s;charge of debts under the bankrupt
&s;tatutes. If, therefore, it can be &s;hown in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, that
the voter took a bribe, or gave a back-bond of tru&s;t; or in
the fourth ca&s;e, that the debtor had in his hand and wilfully
withheld a &s;ufficient bond of caution; or in any of the other
ca&s;es, that he concealed and re&s;erved con&s;iderable funds; he
is alike guilty of perjury, as if he had &s;worn on the refe|rence
of an individual. For he has &s;worn, (which is much
&s;tronger), on the reference and appointment of the law it|&s;elf,
made for the intere&s;t and behoof of all concerned, for
rea&s;ons of public &s;ecurity or advantage. In the &s;ame cla&s;s
&s;eem to &s;tand all tho&s;e (it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed too frequent)
<PB N="144" REF="145">
oaths, which are required to be taken in matters of trade or
revenue. For the&s;e, after the &s;tatutes which have ordered
them to be taken, and appointed the per&s;ons who &s;hall ad|mini&s;ter
them, are lawful and nece&s;&s;ary oaths in the depart|ments
of bu&s;ine&s;s to which they relate.</P>
<P>LAST of all;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oaths of Credu|lity may infer Perjury.</NOTE> no ab&s;olute line of di&s;tinction can be drawn
in this matter between oaths of opinion, (or credulity as they
are commonly called), and others. Since, whatever may be
the common ca&s;e, yet in&s;tances may be imagined, (though
they cannot be frequent, and when they happen, it will be dif|ficult
to &s;how the nece&s;&s;ary evidence), where the oath is &s;uch
in point of form only, and not of &s;ub&s;tance. For what if a
per&s;on have obtained a <HI>meditatione fugae</HI> warrant on his depo&s;i|tion
to the ju&s;tice of his claim upon a bill, which bill he has
him&s;elf forged: Is he not equally indictable for the perjury,
as for the fabrication? Or, grant that the bill is genuine;
what if it was paid the day before, and was extingui&s;hed by a
&s;pecial di&s;charge, obliging the holder to deliver up the bill
it&s;elf as &s;oon as it &s;hould be found? Or &s;uppo&s;e that a letter of
his is recovered, which expre&s;&s;es his &s;atisfaction at <HI>impo&s;ing</HI>
on the Magi&s;trate, and at the pro&s;pect he has of revenge on
his enemy, by keeping him &s;ix months in goal. Or put the
ca&s;e of an architect, who, having vi&s;ited a building by order
of Court, makes oath, that to the be&s;t of his &s;kill and judg|ment
it is good work, and charged at a rea&s;onable rate. If the
building tumble down a few days after, and it can be proved
that the architect received a bribe from the contractor, and
that he afterwards in&s;i&s;ted for a &s;till farther gratification on
account of the wrong he had done his con&s;cience; &s;hall not
the&s;e circum&s;tances lay open the ca&s;e to a charge of perjury?
In all the&s;e in&s;tances, as deci&s;ive evidence is &s;hown of the utter
<PB N="145" REF="146">
fal&s;ehood of the pretended opinion and belief, as if the oath
had related to any vi&s;ible and ordinary fact. Any ground
of he&s;itation, therefore, on this head, lies only here, that in
the <HI>ordinary</HI> ca&s;e, clear and conclu&s;ive proof of the corrupt
<HI>animus</HI> of the man, without which there can be no conviction
of perjury, is not to be obtained: Not to mention, that in
many in&s;tances his mind may have been in that wavering
and uncertain &s;tate, on which it may be difficult to &s;ay, how
his belief or opinion was.</P>
<P>II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of the Te|nor of the fal&s;e Oath.</NOTE> IN regard to the proof of perjury, (the point which
next will demand our attention),&mdash;this is a matter of deli|cacy,
and with re&s;pect to which there is need of more than
ordinary caution; whether on account of the many po&s;&s;ible
mi&s;takes of the words them&s;elves, which the pannel is al|leged
to have u&s;ed, or the &s;till more numerous ways of mi&s;|under&s;tanding
the &s;peaker's meaning in his u&s;e of them, or
the various means of accounting for and reconciling appa|rent
fal&s;ehoods and contradictions. To obviate the fir&s;t of
tho&s;e dangers, it is de&s;irable that the tenor of the oath be
e&s;tabli&s;hed by writing; &s;o as the libel may not only bear
the &s;ub&s;tance of it, but engro&s;s the very words. It is, ac|cordingly,
the rule of all tho&s;e ca&s;es, where regularly, and
in common form, the oath ought to be reduced to writing,
that no other evidence but the written record, &s;igned with
the party's hand, (or with that of the Judge for him if he
cannot write), is admitted to te&s;tify again&s;t him on the
charge of perjury. It is even probable that this doctrine
&s;hall be enforced without exception of tho&s;e more favourable
&s;ituations, where the depo&s;ition was regularly taken, but has
&s;ince been accidentally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="147">
IT does not, however, follow from the propriety of ob|&s;erving
this caution in ca&s;es of that de&s;cription,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of the Te|nor of the fal&s;e Oath.</NOTE> that per|jury
is therefore to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed in tho&s;e exten&s;ive and
important departments of bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as trials in the Courts
of Exchequer and Ju&s;ticiary, where, owing to the contrary
cu&s;tom of proceeding, no &s;uch evidence can be had. By
a proper choice of the witne&s;&s;es, (who in trials for per|jury
will always be required to be per&s;ons of intelli|gence,
and of credit above all &s;u&s;picion), and by due atten|tion
paid to the accurate examination of them, any mate|rial
ri&s;k of error may be avoided; and in this, as in every
other province of law, that &s;ort of evidence mu&s;t be taken,
if not in it&s;elf quite unworthy of credit, which is the be&s;t
that the nature of the ca&s;e allows. In the practice of Eng|land,
the conviction of perjury can in mo&s;t ca&s;es be on no
better grounds. This point has twice received a judgment,
after full debate on the objection. Fir&s;t, in the ca&s;e of Ar|chibald

James Wil&s;on indicted for perjury in a trial in Exchequer.
The older ca&s;e of George Montgomery may even be cited as a
third in&s;tance, in which the &s;ame deci&s;ion was deliberate|ly
given.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 15. 1768. Nov. 28. 1715. Jan. 19. 1719.</NOTE> Though the fact was thus far favourable to the

<P>THESE ob&s;ervations relate to the competent proof of
thetenor of the oath.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of proving that the Oath is fal&s;e.</NOTE> As to the way of proving the fal&s;e|hood
of that which has been &s;worn; it holds in the modern
practice, whether the oath be that of party or witne&s;s, that
this may equally be by parole te&s;timony, as by writing. For
which there is this obvious and &s;ufficient rea&s;on, that the
crime would otherwi&s;e pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed; and that tho&s;e who
&s;uffer by perjury, have not, like the parties to civil con|tracts,
the power of employing writing on the occa&s;ion, and
mu&s;t therefore be allowed to e&s;tabli&s;h the injury by &s;uch
other modes of evidence, as the &s;ituation allows. Judging
by what Mackenzie<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Perjury, No. 5.</NOTE> has &s;aid of this matter, with relation
to the ca&s;e of Lawrie and Skinner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25. 1667.</NOTE> where he was him&s;elf
coun&s;el for the pro&s;ecutor, it might be conceived that judg|ment
had there been given to the contrary. But according
to the record, the matter there in debate was no &s;uch gene|ral
que&s;tion of the competency of parole proof to convict a
witne&s;s of perjury, but a different though al&s;o important que|&s;tion,
namely, Whether perjury might be inferred again&s;t a
witne&s;s, on the &s;ingle <HI>medium</HI> of contrary and more pregnant
parole proof concerning the facts which he had deponed to,
without any aid of farther circum&s;tances, (for none &s;uch are
alluded to in either the libel or debate), to &s;how that the
pannel, equally as the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him, was in the
<PB N="148" REF="149">
knowledge of the truth, and wilfully denied it. The <HI>&s;pe|cies
facti</HI> was this; that in an action at in&s;tance of Rigg,
a mini&s;ter, again&s;t Balcanquhall, a landed man, for payment
of vicarage-duties, Lawrie and Skinner, pannels, being u&s;ed as
witne&s;&s;es, had &s;worn that vicarage-tithe was paid by the lands
in que&s;tion, according to certain rates. Balcanquhall pur|&s;ued
them for perjury; and purpo&s;ed (it appears) to make
good his charge, no otherwi&s;e than through a fuller and
more pregnant proof by other witne&s;&s;es, who &s;hould depone
to the contrary upon that &s;ame matter of the payment and
rates of vicarage. Now this was an attempt in which he
could not expect to be &s;ucce&s;sful. For it is no ground on
which to convict any one of perjury, that he &s;wore to what
is not true, unle&s;s he knew and wickedly concealed the truth,
and can by convincing arguments, and plain or unavoidable
inferences, be &s;hown to have conducted him&s;elf in that man|ner.
The guilt is not to be inferred upon the te&s;timony and
affirmation of the pannel one way, and of others to the
contrary, but upon proof of oppo&s;ite and incon&s;i&s;tent facts,
equally known to the pannel as to the other witne&s;&s;es, and
wilfully di&s;&s;embled or denied by him; which corrupt &s;tate
of his con&s;cience mu&s;t be collected from the whole cir|cum&s;tances
of the ca&s;e. If, for in&s;tance, the pannel be
charged with perjury, in as much as he &s;wore that John did
not fire at James on a certain occa&s;ion; evidence mu&s;t be
given on this indictment, not only of the fact of firing, but of
its being at a time and place when the pannel was pre&s;ent,
and &s;o &s;ituated that he could not but &s;ee and hear the &s;hot;
which may farther be made evident from his conduct at the
time, and his conver&s;ation afterwards, with regard to what
had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">
BUT farther; if it were even true, that the judgment in
the ca&s;e of Lawrie and Skinner tended to exclude all parole
proof of the fal&s;ehood;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of proving that the Oath is fal&s;e.</NOTE> yet &s;till it could not be denied, that
the &s;ame rule has not been followed in later times. The evi|dence

this &s;ort; as it was al&s;o propo&s;ed to be in that of Mackillop,

differs from Mathaeus, and from Voet, who hold, and I

<P>NOW,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of Perjury.</NOTE> &s;ince all the laws but one, (and this one &s;uch as has not
direct relation to the crime of perjury), thus bear an allowance
of farther and indefinite pains, which the late&s;t of all the
<PB N="151" REF="152">
laws expre&s;sly commits to the di&s;cretion of the Court; it
&s;hould &s;eem to be the ju&s;t re&s;ult, that the pains of perjury
are arbitrary, <HI>pro gravitate admi&s;&s;i,</HI> and, in a &s;trong ca&s;e,
may be carried any length that is &s;hort of lo&s;s of life or
limb. The cu&s;tom, accordingly, and con&s;truction of the law,
has been to that effect: Nay, in the older practice, the di&s;cre|tion
of the Court did not even acknowledge any limitation,
in ca&s;es of aggravated or repeated guilt. For, on the 15th
March 1605, Alexander Wa&s;tland was &s;entenced to be hanged
for perjury, at the &s;ame time that Alexander Croy, the infor|mer
on the occa&s;ion, but al&s;o convicted, was &s;entenced to be
&s;courged. On the 8th March 1615, three per&s;ons, named Black|lock,
Dunlop, and Watt, being convicted (it appears) of three
acts of perjury, had &s;entence of death; at the &s;ame time
that other four, le&s;s notorious offenders, viz. Hamilton,
Jack, Moffat, and Bogle, were &s;entenced to be &s;courged, burnt
in the cheek, and bani&s;hed. A third in&s;tance of capital
doom for perjury, is the judgment on Robert Ker and James
Young,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 22. 1622.</NOTE> who were convicted of two acts, and were ordered to
be hanged. David Turnbull, convicted of one act upon the
&s;ame libel with them, had his tongue bored with a hot iron,
and was bani&s;hed under pain of death in ca&s;e of return<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The following &s;eem to be the chief convictions of perjury, be&s;ide tho&s;e which are occa&s;ionally mentioned in the text.

THE ca&s;e where this rigour &s;eems to be mo&s;t &s;uitable, is
that of perjury in a capital trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Perjury in a capital trial.</NOTE> if the trial i&s;&s;ues in the con|viction

perhaps, be law, (as certainly the deliberation, malignity,

other crime for which our law requires the atonement of
the offender's life); yet, as it is rather under the name of

<P>IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Juri&s;diction in trial for Perjury.</NOTE> THE cogni&s;ance of perjury is only peculiar to the
Criminal Court, when it is pur&s;ued in the form of an original

to light, in the cour&s;e of proce&s;s before the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion,
they too have power, and even of their own motion, &s;um|marily

if he has been convicted of a crime; has lo&s;t his civil cau&s;e;

a competition for a &s;eat in Parliament; and thus has &s;uffered
prejudice by the fal&s;e oath. The title la&s;t mentioned, was
&s;u&s;tained on the 27th June 1785, in the ca&s;e of Cumin of
Altyre again&s;t John Law&s;on of We&s;tertown, for taking the
oath of tru&s;t and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as a freeholder; the libel &s;etting
forth that the pannel fal&s;ely took the oath, and voted for a
per&s;on who was returned in preference to the pur&s;uer.</P>
<P>BUT the law will &s;u&s;tain even a weaker intere&s;t than in
any of the&s;e ca&s;es; &s;uch as that of the per&s;on to who&s;e pre|judice
the fal&s;e oath is intended, or again&s;t whom it is pe|culiarly
directed, though the particular injury that was in
view have not en&s;ued. For this prejudice the complainer

enmity and malice, and is for the time alarmed with re&s;pect
to the fate of the intere&s;t which he has at &s;take; not to
mention, that the fal&s;e oath may in many in&s;tances be at|tended
with a prejudice in point of fame, which will not
even be effaced by the &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue of the proceeding in
which the perjury is committed. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, he
is entitled to feel re&s;entment of the wrong, (in like man|ner
as one who&s;e life has been attempted by thru&s;ting or
firing at him, though he have not been wounded); and in
the one ca&s;e, equally as in the other, be&s;ide the gratification
of this natural and ju&s;t feeling, by having him&s;elf a part
in bringing the offender to ju&s;tice, (which is it&s;elf &s;uch an
intere&s;t as the law pays &s;ome regard to), he has the farther
&s;ub&s;tantial intere&s;t of &s;ecuring him&s;elf by means of a con|viction,
again&s;t any repetition of the like attempt on the
part of this per&s;on again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">
IN general, it is to intere&s;ts of this per&s;onal and immedi|ate
kind, &s;uch as belong to a man by rea&s;on of his peculiar
quality or &s;ituation, and not to &s;uch which are common to
a whole cla&s;s or de&s;cription of per&s;ons, that our practice at|tends,
in deciding on the preten&s;ions of an individual to
pro&s;ecute for this or any other crime. It is true, that in
the ca&s;e of James Fife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 5. 1796.</NOTE> the Court were of opinion that the
title of freeholder on the roll of any county, equally as
that of candidate for election, was a &s;ufficient title to pro|&s;ecute
for perjury committed by taking the oath of tru&s;t and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But that deci&s;ion is in nowi&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent with
the general rule which has been mentioned. Becau&s;e the
whole train of election-laws proceed upon the notion, that
every freeholder of any county has &s;uch an intere&s;t in the
choice of its repre&s;entative, as entitles him to u&s;e all reme|dies
for guarding the purity of its roll of electors.</P>
<P>WHATSOEVER be the nature of the private intere&s;t and
title;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The title mu&s;t be &s;tated in the Libel.</NOTE> it ought to be &s;tated and made apparent on the face
of the libel, which mu&s;t cohere and &s;tand by its own
&s;trength, and can receive no &s;ort of aid from &s;uch things as
are not affirmed, but only referred to or left to be implied.
It was on account of a defect of this kind that the Court
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t libel again&s;t William Le&s;lie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 29. 1785.</NOTE> in which it
was not charged that the pannel voted again&s;t the pro&s;ecu|tor,
nor even that he voted at all.</P>
<P>V.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prevarication upon Oath.</NOTE> BEFORE I clo&s;e this chapter, it will not be ami&s;s to add
a word or two concerning perevarication upon oath, or
the wilful concealment of the truth; which is next in de|gree
to perjury, and &s;eems chiefly to differ from it in the
<PB N="155" REF="156">
inferior boldne&s;s and re&s;olution of the offender, who, though
de&s;irous to mi&s;lead the Judge, and make a fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ion,
has rather cho&s;en to compa&s;s this object in the way of an
artful and chicaning oath, than by the direct averment
of plain fal&s;ehoods; or, if he has ventured upon any &s;uch,
has not per&s;i&s;ted in them till the clo&s;e of his oath. This
&s;ort of guilt is chiefly to be gathered from the eva&s;ive and
equivocal an&s;wers of the witne&s;s, the incon&s;i&s;tency of the
different parts of his oath, and his affected ignorance and
want of memory, with re&s;pect to things which it behoves
him to know; more e&s;pecially if he is at la&s;t driven out of all
the&s;e &s;hifts, and is con&s;trained to emit a true, though, taken
on the whole, an incoherent and contradictory depo&s;ition.
As a &s;candalous contempt of the pre&s;ence of the Court, and
of the reverence of an oath, this offence may be &s;ummarily
puni&s;hed in the judicature where it is done, (and it rather
appears only at that time, and before that Court), either
with impri&s;onment, or, if the ca&s;e be more flagrant, with
infamy and the pillory. Of which there are many examples

him to &s;wear according to a written narrative or &s;tate

Our practice annexes the appellation of <HI>deforcement</HI> to this of|fence;
an o&s;&s;ence in former times among the mo&s;t frequent of
any in this country of Scotland, but which in the con&s;idera|tion
of the law, is of no mean degree of guilt. The reprehen|&s;ion
due to it, is not only on account of the high damage
which may attend the hinderance in the particular in&s;tance;
but al&s;o, and more e&s;pecially, becau&s;e it is a contempt of the
authority of the King, as repre&s;ented in his courts of ju&s;tice,
and in the cour&s;e of legal proce&s;s; and is thereby a matter
of evil and mo&s;t dangerous example, which tends to the un|hinging

how low &s;oever their rank, are part of the great plan of judi|cial

this protection is far more requi&s;ite than to his &s;upe|riors;

<P>I. THE following things &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;ary towards pu|ni&s;hment
of the offender in terms of the &s;tatutes again&s;t
deforcement.</P>
<P>1. THE per&s;on deforced mu&s;t be a <HI>lawful officer;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Officer hin|dered mu&s;t be <HI>lawful.</HI></NOTE> one of the
regular and proper executors of that &s;ort of diligence or war|rant
which is hindered. If either he is an ordinary individual,
who of his own authority, has arrogated to him&s;elf the cha|racter
of &s;ervant of the law; or if he is only <HI>in cur&s;u</HI> of being
<PB N="167" REF="168">
appointed (as a me&s;&s;enger who has not yet found caution);
or having once been in the office, if he has been depo&s;ed or
&s;u&s;pended; or being a lawful officer, if he is meddling with
bu&s;ine&s;s which does not belong to his commi&s;&s;ion, (as in the
ca&s;e of a &s;heriff-officer executing letters under the Signet, or
of a con&s;table executing the Sheriff's precept, or in the ca&s;e
of either con&s;table or &s;heriff-officer going out of his proper
bounds, in which ca&s;e he is but as an individual); in all
the&s;e and the like &s;ituations, even though they were attend|ed
with a common belief and error of the neighbourhood as
to the quality of the man, (which in civil que&s;tions might
perhaps be con&s;idered), there can be no proper deforcement
in the re&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e his unwarrantable, and, as they
mu&s;t here be accounted, tortious proceedings. It may even
be doubted, whether by &s;pecial addre&s;s of warrant to a pri|vate
per&s;on <HI>nominatim,</HI> and in a ca&s;e where the urgency of
the bu&s;ine&s;s authori&s;es that manner of proceeding, the man
becomes an officer, (though any one who invades him &s;hall
certainly be puni&s;hable more or le&s;s), to the effect of ground|ing
proce&s;s for the &s;tatutory pains of deforcement. It is to
be con&s;idered, that there are many ca&s;es, where, purely in
virtue of the &s;ituation, every <HI>by&s;tander</HI> has the &s;ame autho|rity,
as by addre&s;s of warrant to him <HI>nominatim,</HI> &s;traightway
to take and detain the per&s;on of a delinquent; and yet it will
&s;carcely be alleged, that in the&s;e &s;ituations al&s;o, the indivi|dual
is in this re&s;pect inve&s;ted with the full privilege of an
officer of the law.</P>
<P>2. THE officer mu&s;t not only be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a lawful com|mi&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t be hinder|ed in an official act.</NOTE>
but he mu&s;t be in the execution of &s;omething which
appertains to that commi&s;&s;ion, at the time when he is hinder|ed
<PB N="168" REF="169">
or mole&s;ted. For the offence is not to the individual,
but to the officer, and to the law, which is violated in his
per&s;on. He has not, therefore, the protection of the &s;tatu|tory
pains, in every common broil he may get engaged in.
Neither does he enjoy it on occa&s;ion even of every act
which he does by order of a Magi&s;trate, if it is not a proper
act of &s;olemn or official duty, but &s;uch a piece of &s;ervice as
needs no warrant, and which one who is not an officer
might perform: As if a &s;heriff-officer be carrying a packet
of letters from the Sheriff, or have been &s;ent to a certain
quarter of the county, to make private inquiries about &s;uch
a crime, and is, on account of that errand, waylaid and
beaten, and has his packet taken from him. For, though he
may have been cho&s;en for this employment, by rea&s;on of
his &s;tation, and his connection with the Magi&s;trate; yet the
authority and powers of his office are nowi&s;e concerned nor
exerted in the performance of it; nor is he pointed out
therein to the public as one of that employment. The of|fence
is, therefore, only an a&s;&s;ault and battery, though aggra|vated
certainly by the &s;tation of the &s;ufferer, and by the
offender's motive. In &s;hort, deforcement only lies in the
hindering of tho&s;e formal and &s;olemn proceedings, (<HI>actus le|gitimi</HI>),
for which written authorities are given, and which
it belongs only to an officer of the law to carry through.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame limitation will hold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t have begun to do his official act.</NOTE> in ca&s;es even of a le&s;s re|mote
connection with the duty of the man as an officer, and
where the occa&s;ion of mole&s;ting him is in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ub|&s;ervient
or preparatory to the doing of an official act. If a
me&s;&s;enger be attacked in his own hou&s;e, and have his letters
of caption taken from him, when preparing to &s;et out upon
<PB N="169" REF="170">
a journey, to put them in execution; or if he be met half
way upon the road, and be there &s;topped and &s;tripped of his
diligence, by per&s;ons who have information of his errand;
in neither of the&s;e ca&s;es are the invaders guilty of deforce|ment:
becau&s;e there is not an inchoated execution of the di|ligence,
nor any a&s;&s;umption (as <HI>in actu proximo</HI> to execution)
of the official character, under which only the officer can
be deforced. In illu&s;tration of this remark, I may refer to
the ca&s;e (for the &s;ame rule will govern in that department)
of John Wallace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 26. 1730.</NOTE> indicted for a&s;&s;ault on an officer of the
revenue. The charge was thus: that John Young, a tide|water,
having e&s;pied a ve&s;&s;el hovering upon the coa&s;t, and
boats making off to it from &s;hore, with the purpo&s;e, as he
&s;u&s;pected of running goods; he concealed him&s;elf at a conve|nient
&s;tation in a field of corn, there to lie and take ob&s;erva|tion
of what might happen. But in this &s;ituation, being di&s;|covered
by the pannel and his a&s;&s;ociates, who dealt in &s;inug|gling,
and who knew the man and his purpo&s;e, he was on that
account &s;everely brui&s;ed and beaten by them, and was com|pelled,
with threats and imprecations, to take an oath in their
hands, that none of their goods &s;hould be &s;eized. Yet this
was only libelled at common law, as an aggravated violence
or riot<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">That where by the laws and practice of this, and all other well governed realms, <HI>riot and violence,</HI> and the <HI>invading, beating or brui&s;ing,</HI> with $laves or other weapons, any of our lieges, without the lea&s;t cau&s;e or colour of provocation, are atrocious crimes, and &s;everely puni&s;hable, e&s;pecially when aggravated by being done and committed to the great effu&s;ion of blood, and in a barbarous and mercile&s;s manner, upon tho&s;e who are more immediately under the protec|tion of the law, &s;uch as officers of the revenue in the di&s;charge of the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in them; and when &s;uch violence and barbarity are u&s;ed as a mean to extort imprecations, from the per&s;on &s;o maltreated, upon him&s;elf, if he faith|fully executed his office, and performed the duty thereof; yet true it is,&endq; &amp;c.</NOTE>, and not on any of the &s;tatutes again&s;t deforcement of

of this occa&s;ion with the tru&s;t of the man's office, as
charged in the libel; yet it was no part of any &s;pecial act of
&s;eizure, conveyance, or the like, to which alone the protec|tion
of tho&s;e &s;tatutes applies.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame direction will equally apply to &s;uch injuries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t be engaged in doing his offi|cial act.</NOTE> as

his array of office, and abandoned all thought of per&s;i&s;ting
in his diligence; being, for in&s;tance, met on his journey
homeward, by another &s;et of people, but engaged in the
&s;ame intere&s;t, who in&s;ult and abu&s;e him. This di&s;tinction
was accordingly made in the ca&s;e of Janet Hay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 16. 1728.</NOTE> who was
charged with deforcing a me&s;&s;enger in the town of Tranent,
and afterwards in&s;tigating a rabble, who followed him and
his party to Pre&s;tonpans and other places, on his way to
Edinburgh, and there abu&s;ed and beat him. Now, the fir&s;t

the other, as for a riot and beating only.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Found that Janet Hay, pannel, having the time libelled, in the town of Tranent, deforced the complainer George Innes, in the eexcution of letters of caption again&s;t Walter Allan, merchant in Tranent, the &s;aid George having, at the time his blazon di&s;played, and his wand of peace in his hand; or that &s;he the pannel was art and part thereof, relevant to in&s;er <HI>the pains of deforce|ment;</HI> as al&s;o, the &s;aid Lords found the &s;aid Janet Hay, pannel, having on the day libelled, rai&s;ed and outhounded a mob in the town of Tranent again&s;t the complainers, and the &s;aid mob having <HI>followed them out of own, and thereafter having beat the &s;aid complainers,</HI> or either of them, <HI>&s;eparatim,</HI> relevant to in|fer an <HI>arbitrary puni&s;hment.</HI>&endq;</NOTE>.</P>

and entered on his commi&s;&s;ion; being in near and immedi|ate

if he &s;hall be permitted. Thus it is a deforcement, if, when
the me&s;&s;enger, bearing letters of caption, has come near the

di&s;played his blazon, he is met by a ho&s;t of people, who

it lies with the officer to notify his quality of &s;ervant of
the law; in order that tho&s;e concerned, who may be quite
ignorant of him and his office, may be warned of their
duty, and of the con&s;equences of re&s;i&s;tance. As to what
&s;hall be e&s;teemed a due compliance in this particular; thus
far is certain, that in the ca&s;e of me&s;&s;engers and con&s;tables,
who&s;e blazon and baton are the known badges and outward
te&s;timonies of their commi&s;&s;ion, the &s;howing of the&s;e, which
are given them for this very purpo&s;e, is &s;ufficient proclama|tion
of the office-bearer; and will be held to put every
man on his guard, that it is at his own peril, if he &s;hall di&s;|pute
the authority of the per&s;on who produces them. Pro|bably
too, if the me&s;&s;enger or con&s;table be acting in a quar|ter
of the country where he is not known; or in the ca&s;e of
re&s;i&s;tance by per&s;ons who are &s;trangers to him; the want of
the&s;e, the vi&s;ible &s;ymbols of his office, which in &s;uch a ca&s;e
he ought to have upon him, will &s;carcely be &s;upplied by his
verbal a&s;&s;ertion of the fact to the oppo&s;ers, (which may ei|ther
be true or fal&s;e for aught that is known to them); nor
even by his &s;hewing of the diligence, which may happen to
be in the hands of one who is not an officer of the law. The
di&s;play of the blazon is, therefore, among the ordinary cir|cum&s;tances,
which are &s;et forth in a libel for deforcement.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">
NEVERTHELESS; that this is indi&s;pen&s;ible on all occa|&s;ions,
and without exception even of tho&s;e &s;ituations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;play of Bla|zon; if indi&s;|pen&s;ible.</NOTE> where
the rea&s;ons of requiring &s;uch a thing do not apply, is not
&s;o probable in it&s;elf; neither does it &s;eem to be &s;ettled
by any judgments, which have yet been pronounced. The&s;e
<HI>in&s;ignia</HI> of office are given the officers, (and in that view mo&s;t
properly), for their protection among &s;trangers, and in all
&s;ituations, the newe&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;tant, where their duty
may chance to call them. But in the ca&s;e of a per&s;on who
is of the officer's acquaintance, or who&s;e whole behavour at
the time &s;hows, that he knows the man and his employment,
there &s;eems to be no need of any farther notification of that
matter; nor any good rea&s;on why &s;uch a one &s;hould be allowed
to indulge in blood and violence, under the affected pretence
of fear of his per&s;onal &s;afety, or of indignation at the attempt
upon his property or freedom. The me&s;&s;enger is &s;uch, without,
as well as with his blazon; and if he tell this per&s;on, who
already knows him for a me&s;&s;enger, that he comes for an
official purpo&s;e, and al&s;o &s;how him his diligence or war|rant;
then is the man in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the facts which
are requi&s;ite to the regulation of his conduct on the occa|&s;ion;
and he cannot therefore be free of the guilt of a
wilful contempt. Notice may accordingly be taken of the&s;e
libels, which do not bear the di&s;play of blazon, and yet are
found relevant; the libel again&s;t Margaret Yule, June 21.
1680; again&s;t Anne Elphin&s;ton, February 14. 1687; and
again&s;t Macneil of Bara, July 28. 1679. In the la&s;t in&s;tance,
that circum&s;tance &s;eems, however, to have been the &s;ubject
of proof<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It was found, in the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, <HI>January</HI> 18. 1699, <HI>(Lord Kinnaird),</HI> that the me&s;&s;enger executing caption, need not &s;how his blazon, till he has ap|prehended prehended the debtor. In the ca&s;e of <HI>Har&s;e again&s;t Fork, March</HI> 1685, (Har|car&s;e), it was found that a me&s;&s;enger, though known to be &s;uch, might be de|forced, being without his blazon. But the reporter ob&s;erves, that there was a &s;pecialty in the ca&s;e. Neither is it &s;aid, that the me&s;&s;enger had in any way inti|mated the purpo&s;e of his coming.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175">
4. THOUGH the party well know that the per&s;on is a me&s;&s;en|ger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t notify that he is acting offi|cially.</NOTE>
he may not be aware that he has come there in his office
at the time: It lies, therefore, with the me&s;&s;enger, before pro|ceeding,
duly to warn him in this article too; for which pur|po&s;e,
the natural and mo&s;t advantageous cour&s;e appears to
be, by making mention of the particular duty on which he is
come, and by exhibition of his diligence or warrant. It
cannot, however, be laid down for law, that there is no
deforcement, unle&s;s where this precaution is ob&s;erved. On
the contrary, it has more than once been proceeded on, and
&s;eems indeed to be a point of &s;ettled doctrine, that the di&s;|play
of blazon is it&s;elf warning to the party, not only of the
bearer's office of me&s;&s;enger, but of his coming for &s;ome
purpo&s;e of official execution. Seeing the me&s;&s;enger in the
array of his office; if he have any doubt of his errand, or of
his authority, the party is bound to que&s;tion it in a peace|able
and orderly manner, and to &s;atisfy him&s;elf, by call|ing
for the warrant, that &s;uch exi&s;ts and is there, and con|cerning
its nature and extent. If, in&s;tead of following
this dutiful cour&s;e, he &s;traightway, and without a&s;king a
que&s;tion, a&s;&s;ault the me&s;&s;enger; he &s;hews a determination to
deforce at all events, and excludes any plea he might other|wi&s;e
have had, if, upon requi&s;ition, the diligence had not
been forthcoming. The objection taken on this ground, of
the officer's omi&s;&s;ion to exhibit his diligence, has been repel|led
in two ca&s;es of deforcement of caption;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 19. &amp; 26. 1672.</NOTE> that of Gordon
of Braco,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23. and Aug. 6. 1722.</NOTE> and of Campbell of Lawers: As al&s;o, in two ca&s;es

<P>In Campbell's ca&s;e, the defence was, &startq;That the me&s;&s;enger did not tell Sawers that he had a caption, or was going to apprehend him; and that &s;ince he did not tell him, the pannel could not know his errand, and con&s;equently could not be guilty of deforcement in re&s;i&s;ting him.&endq; And again, &startq;<HI>It</HI> is not &s;aid in the li|bel, that the me&s;&s;enger apprehended the pannel, or touched him with the wand of peace, or that he &s;o much as &s;howed his letters of caption.&endq; It is an&s;wered, <HI>inter alia,</HI> &startq;It is &s;ufficient that it is libelled, the me&s;&s;enger <HI>with his blazon di&s;|played,</HI> was proceeding to do his duty: If Sawers did not know the me&s;&s;en|ger's errand, Why was he &s;o ready to deforce him violently?

<P>IT &s;eems to be equally agreed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t &s;how his diligence, <HI>if re|quired.</HI></NOTE> on the other part, that if
the me&s;&s;enger, being required to &s;how his warrant, &s;hall re|fu&s;e
or decline to give &s;atisfaction in that particular, and
&s;hall neverthele&s;s per&s;i&s;t in the execution of it, it is not
a deforcement to oppo&s;e him. The party is authori&s;ed
to believe in that ca&s;e, that in truth he has not the war|rant
with him, and by con&s;equence that he does wrong in
attempting to put it in force. In the debate on all the ca&s;es
above mentioned, it &s;eems accordingly to be yielded, that
the me&s;&s;enger, if he had been required to &s;how his letters,
was under the nece&s;&s;ity of complying, and could not be
ju&s;tified if he refu&s;ed. And &s;uch a refu&s;al, along with other

<P>THE following limitations of this rule &s;eem however very
nece&s;&s;ary to be attended to.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limitations of that rule.</NOTE> Fir&s;t, though the me&s;&s;enger mu&s;t
&s;how, he is not obliged to part with his diligence, nor to put it
into the hands of the party; who might detain it from him
or de&s;troy it. Even if he give it to any impartial by &s;tander
to examine, it &s;eems to be matter of indulgence rather than
otherwi&s;e; for the officer, who is tru&s;ted with the diligence,
and with the intere&s;t of his employer, may ju&s;tly refu&s;e to
put his warrant in any ca&s;e into the power of another. 2dly,
Even the &s;howing of the warrant is to be under&s;tood as
chiefly applicable to the ca&s;e of requi&s;ition by the party
him&s;elf, or tho&s;e who are lawfully intere&s;ted for him; and
this limitation will more e&s;pecially hold good, if the chal|lenge
does not happen in the entry of the execution, but
at &s;ome after period in the progre&s;s of it, when the offi|cer
is already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his object. If the debtor
has &s;ubmited to the me&s;&s;enger bearing caption again&s;t him,
and is on his way to goal, or has gone to a place of
<PB N="177" REF="178">
cu&s;tody for the time; or if the officer has completed the forms
of poinding, of which the very fir&s;t is the reading of the let|ters,
and is carrying off the goods to a place of &s;afety; or
even if he has made the fir&s;t apprizing, and is conveying the
goods to the market-cro&s;s; he is not afterwards obliged to an|&s;wer
the que&s;tions of every new comer, and &s;till le&s;s of a pro|mi&s;euous
rabble, concerning his authority and commi&s;&s;ion.
It is the duty of every man who finds an officer of the law in
this &s;tate of &s;ettled po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to &s;tand by and not to meddle
with that which does not concern him, whether it be right
or wrong; and for which, if it be wrong, tho&s;e who are inte|re&s;ted
can have &s;ure redre&s;s, without his interference. For
this rea&s;on, if for no other, the objection taken upon the
failure to &s;how the letters, was not good in the &s;aid ca&s;e of
Hamilton in 1725; where one part of the charge was for vio|lent
oppo&s;ition to a poinding by a di&s;orderly multitude, after
performance of the fir&s;t apprizing, and when the goods were
&s;ome miles upon the way to the neare&s;t burgh. 3dly, It is
certain, in regard to the precaution on the officer's part, of
telling the purpo&s;e for which he is come, that this is only ne|ce&s;&s;ary
on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the party is or may be igno|rant
in that re&s;pect. For if it clearly appear from the con|duct
of the offender and his friends, that they well under|&s;tood,
and had previous notice of the officer's errand, (which
will be evident if they attack him &s;traightway on his appear|ance,
without a&s;king que&s;tions, or giving time for any expla|nation),
the charge of deforcement will be equally good, as
if more deliberation had been u&s;ed on either part.</P>
<P>5. THE officer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Officer mu&s;t pro|ceed in lawful Manner.</NOTE> having duly introduced him&s;elf and his
commi&s;&s;ion, has al&s;o to proceed in the performance of it
<PB N="178" REF="179">
after the manner by law directed; being only then in his
office when he exerci&s;es it lawfully, and being obliged to
know as much of the law, as concerns the matter of the &s;e|veral
diligences, and the proper time and circum&s;tances of
putting them to execution. If therefore, a me&s;&s;enger &s;hall
execute letters of caption upon Sunday, or after &s;eeing a &s;i&s;t
or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of them; or if any officer &s;hall attempt to

liberties which he had previou&s;ly taken with the goods or
per&s;on of the killer, and the length he had gone in the
unlawful pro&s;ecution of his diligence, whether the killing
of him may not even amount to murder. For, what ir|regularity
of the diligence or execution of it &s;hall deprive
the officer of his defence of ju&s;tifiable homicide, if he
&s;hall kill the party re&s;i&s;ting; and what &s;hall cut him &s;hort
of his proce&s;s for deforcement again&s;t that party; and what
&s;hall ju&s;tify or &s;hall excu&s;e the party, if he &s;hall maim or
kill the officer: The&s;e are three di&s;tinct inquiries, not in|deed
quite without connection, but as certainly not &s;it to be
determined by one and the &s;ame rule; &s;ince they relate to
three &s;everal cour&s;es of conduct, which proceed from very dif|ferent
habits of mind in the offender. Simply to hinder the
<PB N="182" REF="183">
officer from executing his irregular diligence, is one ca&s;e;
wantonly or unnece&s;&s;arily to maim or kill him in the execu|tion
of that diligence, is another; and for the officer to
kill the party in the execution of it, is a third; each of
which has its &s;uitable deci&s;ion, drawn from the degree of
what is done.</P>
<P>6. AS the officer mu&s;t be in his duty at the time he is ob|&s;tructed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;truction mu&s;t relate to the Of|ficer's Duty.</NOTE>
&s;o mu&s;t the ob&s;truction relate to his duty, and be
made with the purpo&s;e, and upon the lawle&s;s re&s;olution, of
hindering him to perform it. That is to &s;ay; if, in the cour&s;e
of executing any diligence, an occa&s;ional quarrel &s;hall ari&s;e
between the me&s;&s;enger, or any of his concurrents, and
a by&s;tander, who conceives him&s;elf to be injured or in|&s;ulted
on the &s;pot; or if one who bears enmity to the me&s;|&s;enger,
and who finds the opportunity convenient, &s;hall
take advantage of it to invade him for the &s;atisfying
of his malice; in neither of the&s;e ca&s;es is the offender
guilty of deforcement, but of battery or a&s;&s;ault only; though
the injury be even of that degree, which di&s;ables the officer
to proceed with his diligence. For it is not inflicted, (where|in
lies the character of deforcement), with the pre&s;umptuous
purpo&s;e of &s;topping the proce&s;s of the law. The libel was
accordingly drawn as for an a&s;&s;ault, in the ca&s;e of Alexan|der
Innes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>The pannel's information &s;ays, &startq;The defender could ea&s;ily prove that he had got provocation, in as much as in a public company the pre&s;ent pur&s;uer was plea&s;ed to term him a notorious liar in his ab&s;ence; and this was the fir&s;t accidental meeting they had thereafter.&endq;</P>

<P>7. LAST of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What degree of violence nece&s;&s;a|ry to this crime.</NOTE> as to the requi&s;ite degree of hinderance
and mole&s;tation. The words of the &s;tatute 1592, c. 152. in
that pa&s;&s;age where it de&s;cribes the offence, have given oc|ca&s;ion
to argue, that there is no deforcement unle&s;s the offi|cer
be a&s;&s;aulted to the effu&s;ion of his blood<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The words are, &startq;Or in putting of decrees to due execution be deforced in doing of the &s;ame, <HI>or be mole&s;ted, invaded or pur&s;ued to the effu&s;ion of their blood.</HI>&endq;</NOTE>. But it is
certain, that no &s;uch narrow, and indeed pernicious con|&s;truction
<PB N="184" REF="185">
of the law, has ever been received into practice.
On the contrary; as rea&s;on and policy require, the crime
has always been held to be committed, wherever, either
by any &s;ort of actual violence, or by plain &s;hew and prepa|ration
of mi&s;chief, or by the wilful oppo&s;ing of real impedi|ments
in his way, the officer has been hindered, or di&s;|abled,
from proceeding with the execution of his duty.
Under&s;tanding always, that, upon the whole ca&s;e, his alarm
is rea&s;onable; and that he does not con&s;true the mere
clamour and bu&s;tle, which are incident to &s;uch occa&s;ions,
into re&s;i&s;tance of his proceedings. Thus, it is plainly a
deforcement, if the me&s;&s;enger be fired at or pur&s;ued with
mortal weapons, though he be nowi&s;e hurt nor wound|ed;
as in Macniel's ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1679. June 1715. July 25. 1719.</NOTE> and in that of Sutherland, and
that of Forbes of Tolquhon<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">July 25. &startq;The jury find, that the pannel William Forbes, &amp;c. did refu&s;e acce&s;s to the man&s;ion-hou&s;e of Tolquhon, and oppo&s;ed by him&s;elf or others, tho&s;e authori&s;ed and empowered for executing the letters of ejection, by throw|ing &s;tones, threatening to fire, and by firing from the top of the &s;aid hou&s;e.&endq; Sentence pa&s;&s;ed for the &s;tatutory pains on the 28th July.</NOTE>.

in the ca&s;e of Campbell of Lawers, in July 1722), who &s;hew
their arms, and forbid him acce&s;s to the hou&s;e, and warn

where the debtor is, in order to take him from the

all the&s;e, and the like ca&s;es of violent hinderance and mo|le&s;tation,
the oppo&s;er is guilty of deforcement, though the
officer e&s;cape unhurt on the occa&s;ion. Accordingly, in the

<P><PB N="186" REF="187">
THIS, in truth, is a &s;alutary, or rather a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;truc|tion
of the law. For if it behoved the officer to per&s;i&s;t,
to the &s;uffering of &s;ome great injury in his per&s;on, and if he
could only then de&s;i&s;t with &s;afety to the intere&s;t of his em|ployer,
when he &s;hould be in in&s;tant danger of his life;
either his trade would be a &s;tate of con&s;tant warfare, or his
office would &s;oon fall into contempt.</P>
<P>ONE circum&s;tance mu&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No deforcement, unle&s;s the dili|gence be hinder|ed.</NOTE> however, attend the violence in
every ca&s;e of deforcement: It mu&s;t be &s;uch as hinders the

and even be in danger of his life; if he neverthele&s;s
per&s;i&s;t and fully accompli&s;h his object, he cannot pro&s;e|cute
for deforcement, but only for the attempt to deforce,
or for the a&s;&s;ault and real injury, of which it may ju&s;tly be
charged as an aggravation, that they were committed with
&s;uch a purpo&s;e. It is no le&s;s clear in favour of the officer,
that, after he has once been con&s;trained to de&s;ert his &s;er|vice
and quit the field, the offender cannot by any re|pentance,
nor even by actual re&s;titution of the effects, nor
by &s;urrender of the debtor's per&s;on, do away his fault,
&s;o as to exclude the King's intere&s;t, or even that of the pri|vate
party, to pro&s;ecute for the public wrong. For, as has
been &s;aid, the law more con&s;iders the contempt of authority
in this matter, than the patrimonial damage. Such a defence
was pleaded in the afore&s;aid ca&s;e of Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1725. and Jan. 1726.</NOTE> &amp;c. and &s;eems

The words of the act 1592, might indeed &s;eem to

<P>WHAT degree of concern in the hinderance &s;hall be &s;uffi|cient
to involve any one as art and part of deforcement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of Deforcement.</NOTE> is
not determined by any peculiar rule, but according to the

Mitchell; that being required, as a Magi&s;trate, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the

not interfere nor command them to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>II. THE provi&s;ions which our Legi&s;lature have made for

of the act 1581, c. 118. which &s;ubjects the offenders to e&s;|cheat
of moveables, and to puni&s;hment of their per&s;ons <HI>at
<PB N="190" REF="191">
our Sovereign Lord's will;</HI> and &s;till more to judge by the
words of the &s;tatute 1587, c. 85. which declares, &startq;that <HI>their
lives</HI> and gudes &s;hall be at the King's will therefor,&endq; we
might be led to conclude that the Legi&s;lature meant to give
a power of applying even the highe&s;t pains, if the occa&s;ion
&s;hould require it. But it does not appear, that the&s;e &s;tatutes
have in any in&s;tance been pleaded to any higher effect, than
that of inflicting an arbitrary puni&s;hment; and even this
does not &s;eem to have been ever carried farther than impri|&s;onment,
in addition to the pecuniary pains. The following
are examples of &s;entence to that effect: The ca&s;e of Gordon
of Braco,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 2. &amp; 6. 1665.</NOTE> (February 1672);&mdash;of Francis Duguid, (December

John Macleod, (in July 1759), who was &s;ent to pri&s;on for

<P>THE patrimonial pains are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pecuniary Pains of Deforcement.</NOTE> 1&s;t, the e&s;cheat of moveables;
introduced by the act 1581, c. 118. and afterwards more
particularly regulated by the act 1592, c. 152.; which di|directs

(who formerly drew the whole), and the other to the party,
purcha&s;er of the proceedings which have been hindered.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF BREAKING PRISON.</HEAD>
<P>THE offence of breaking pri&s;on, equally as that of de|forcement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BREAKING PRISON.</NOTE>
&s;eems properly to belong to that order of
crimes which are the &s;ubjects of our pre&s;ent inquiry;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons of Pu|ni&s;hment.</NOTE> be|cau&s;e
the guilt of it lies chiefly in this, that it is an in&s;ult to
the law and civil government of the country. Tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary
places of confinement are part of the public property, and
of the e&s;tabli&s;hment for the con&s;ervation of peace and ad|mini&s;tration
of ju&s;tice; and are to be viewed &s;omewhat in
the &s;ame light as the inferior officers and mini&s;ters of the
law, who&s;e &s;ervice is e&s;&s;ential to the Judges and Magi&s;trates
of the land, towards the maintaining of their authority, and
the effectual performance of their functions. Like them,
therefore, they have &s;ome portion of that awe and &s;anctity im|parted
to them, which re&s;ides in all the members of the judi|cial
department; &s;o that their fabric mu&s;t be protected from
all violent and rebellious attacks, either of enemies from with|out,
or of the pri&s;oners them&s;elves. Nor is it the injury
and in&s;ult to the building that is alone to be con&s;idered on
&s;uch occa&s;ions, but al&s;o, and more e&s;pecially, the breaking of
the &s;tate it&s;elf of public and lawful cu&s;tody; out of which
<PB N="196" REF="197">
when any one takes him&s;elf by his own authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIV.</NOTE> he is guil|ty
of a contempt of the Magi&s;trate on who&s;e warrant he is
confined, and interferes with the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, and of
the law of the land, which has made this arrangement for
the keeping of him, and &s;ees good cau&s;e for ordering things
to be conducted in that manner.</P>
<P>1. SUCH being the general notion of this offence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">May be commit|ted by any Pri|&s;oner.</NOTE> it is
held to be committed, what&s;oever be the quality of the pri|&s;oner
as to the cau&s;e of his commitment; whether it be that
he is a pri&s;oner for debt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 3. 1673</NOTE> (as in the ca&s;e of Irvine of Hilton),
who is under a proper obligation to pay, and not to fru&s;trate
his creditor's deligence, or that he is confined on a crimi|nal
or even a capital charge; a condition which might &s;eem
to warrant the accu&s;ed to e&s;cape, and redeem his blood, if in
any way he can. The Judge may indeed regret the nece&s;&s;i|ty
of puni&s;hing in &s;uch a ca&s;e; yet &s;till he cannot make al|lowance
for the temptation, as a plea to exculpate from the
charge. For whether the man be innocent or guilty, it is
his duty as a &s;ubject to await the determination of the law
with re&s;pect to him; and he mu&s;t be deemed in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
culpable and mutinous in doing otherwi&s;e. The libel
was accordingly found relevant in the ca&s;e of John Pringle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 6. 17$5.</NOTE> and of James Inglis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1720.</NOTE> both of them pri&s;oners upon charge of
capital offences.</P>
<P>2. THOUGH the puni&s;hment will not always be the &s;ame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And by any manner of E&s;cape.</NOTE> the
crime is however held to be independent al&s;o of the manner
of the e&s;cape; whether it be by effraction of the building,
or by violence u&s;ed to the keeper, or by artful devices (&s;uch
as the u&s;e of fal&s;e keys or picklocks), or by corrupting the

This Ratcliff was a pri&s;oner for capital crimes.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to Mackenzie, who was him&s;elf coun&s;el for
the pannel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 3. 1673.</NOTE> the like deci&s;ion was given in the ca&s;e of Irvine
of Hilton, a pri&s;oner for debt. And certainly it would re|quire
&s;ome &s;trong rea&s;on to exempt &s;uch a one from a mea&s;ure
of duty and obedience, which is thus exacted of the per&s;on
who &s;tands in hazard of his life and per&s;on. But it does
not appear from the record, that this que&s;tion either was or
could be determined in the ca&s;e of Irvine; where the libel
charged the violent effraction of a vault in the building, or
art and part thereof, by the pannel and five per&s;ons more, who
<PB N="198" REF="199">
were all mi&s;&s;ing on the &s;ame morning, and &s;eem to have made
good their e&s;cape by means of a rope let down from a win|dow.
This, therefore, was the &s;ubject of debate on that oc|ca&s;ion;
whether, from the pannel's e&s;cape in the &s;ame night,
and by the &s;ame expedient as the other pri&s;oners, he &s;hould be
pre&s;umed to have been art and part of the effraction of the
vault; and if it lay with him to prove, in the way of defence,
that the others were the active per&s;ons in the breaking, and
that he only <HI>ex pa&s;t facto</HI> availed him&s;elf of the opportunity
which they had given him, to regain his freedom. The in|terlocutor

<P>3. BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breach of unlaw|ful Impri&s;on|ment.</NOTE> to place the pannel in the po&s;&s;ibility of committing
this offence, he mu&s;t have been in a &s;tate of lawful cu&s;tody;
meaning by this, that he have been detained upon a warrant
truly directed again&s;t him, and proceeding from a ju&s;t autho|rity.
For upon any charge of breaking pri&s;on, the fir&s;t &s;tep
on the pro&s;ecutor's part mu&s;t be, to prove that the pannel was
<HI>a pri&s;oner;</HI> one whom the keeper of that gaol had a mandate,
<HI>ex facie</HI> regular, to confine. Now, if either the pannel has
been laid hold of in&s;tead of another per&s;on; or if he is not of
the name mentioned in the warrant; or if there be no written
<PB N="199" REF="200">
warrant, in a ca&s;e where the ordinary cour&s;e of law requires
one; or if the warrant proceed from one who is no Magi&s;trate
for tho&s;e bounds; in any of the&s;e ca&s;es the man is not proper|ly
a pri&s;oner in the &s;en&s;e of law as to this que&s;tion, and can|not
therefore be charged with it as a crime, (at lea&s;t, if he
u&s;e no cruelty nor exce&s;s in accompli&s;hing his purpo&s;e), that
he relieves him&s;elf from this (as it mu&s;t be accounted) un|warrantable
&s;tate of confinement. This point &s;eems virtually
to have received a judgment in the ca&s;e of James Inglis alrea|dy
quoted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1720.</NOTE> The libel charged three different acts of breaking
pri&s;on; of which one was an e&s;cape from the gaol of Edin|burgh,
where he was pri&s;oner upon the warrant of one of the
Lords of Ju&s;ticiary, and the other two were e&s;capes from the
gaol of Tranent, to which he had twice been committed by
a con&s;table, who had him in cu&s;tody on &s;u&s;picion of hor&s;e|&s;tealing.
It was pleaded for him, that a con&s;table could not
impri&s;on. Accordingly, the interlocutor of relevancy &s;u&s;tains
the fir&s;t charge, and takes no notice of either of the others<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Find, that the pannel being impri&s;oned within the tolbooth of Edinburgh, upon warrant of one of the Lords of Ju&s;ticiary, did, the time libelled break the &s;aid pri&s;on, and make his e&s;cape, relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;h|ment.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT if the warrant is apparently good; being directed
again&s;t the pannel, and proceeding from one who is competent
to give it, and not being marked with any plain vice upon the
face of it; the&s;e things will con&s;titute the man a pri&s;oner as
to this article of duty, and lay him under the nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;eeking his relief in cour&s;e of law, on the ground of tho&s;e
more remote and le&s;s palpable irregularities, if &s;uch there
be, which have been committed in the proceedings ante|rior
to application for the warrant, or even in the imme|diate
<PB N="200" REF="201">
cour&s;e of proce&s;s for obtaining it. Thus, if war|rant
<HI>meditatione fugae,</HI> has been granted on an irregular oath<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Are we to judge by the &s;ame rule, in the ca&s;e of warrant of commitment for a crime, which does not proceed upon a &s;igned information? It may be urg|ed, that according to the act 1701, c. 6. the gaoler who detains on &s;uch warrant, is equally liable as the Magi&s;trate who gives it, in the penalties of wrongous impri|&s;onment. On the other hand, wherever the warrant is &s;eparate from the infor|mation, (which often happens), the gaoler knows nothing of the defect; nor is he entitled to inquire at the Magi&s;trate about it, nor to refu&s;e obedience on any &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ition. For which rea&s;ons, it may perhaps be thought, that the gaoler paying the penalties, &s;hall have relief again&s;t the Magi&s;trate. The ca&s;e of war|rant of commitment which does expre&s;s the crime, &s;eems to be more unfavour|able to the gaoler. For the fault here appears on the face of the warrant; and the gaoler, (who is obliged to know thus much of the law), may refu&s;e to obey the warrant, or receive the per&s;on into cu&s;tody.</NOTE>,
or if letters of horning i&s;&s;ue on a decree of the Ju&s;tices
of Peace; in either ca&s;e, the debtor is a pri&s;oner, and can|not
break his &s;tate of cu&s;tody, without being guilty of a
crime. In &s;ituations of this &s;ort, where the per&s;on has
been reduced to a &s;tate of &s;ettled cu&s;tody, the ca&s;e is not
near &s;o favourable as that of one who re&s;i&s;ts the fir&s;t exe|cution
of an irregular warrant to apprehend him; and for
whom it may be argued, that he only endeavours to main|tain
him&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;tate of freedom. It is
to be con&s;idered, too, concerning all vices of this de&s;crip|tion,
which are extrin&s;ic to the face of the commitment,
that the goaler has no power to inquire into them, and can|not
refu&s;e to obey upon &s;uch pretences; &s;o that he being
authori&s;ed and obliged to detain, there cannot al&s;o be an op|po&s;ite
right in the pri&s;oner to break that &s;tate of cu&s;tody,
or to re&s;i&s;t him. If the judicial means of relief in &s;uch &s;i|tuations
be &s;ubject to delays; the law in requiring the&s;e,
which is done for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice and due inve&s;tigation,
<PB N="201" REF="202">
has in effect commanded the pri&s;oner to &s;ubmit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BREAKING PRISON.</NOTE> in the mean
time, and tru&s;t to the obtaining full reparation in the end,
of all the wrong he may &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o to be remembered, re&s;pecting even the former
and more favourable ca&s;e, of warrant which is intrin&s;ically
vicious, that the pri&s;oner &s;hall not &s;tand excu&s;ed from pu|ni&s;hment,
though in &s;trictne&s;s he cannot be indicted for the
crime of breaking pri&s;on, if he conduct his e&s;cape with
outrage and cruelty to the gaoler, or by exciting a mutiny
and commotion among the other pri&s;oners. Still le&s;s is it
to be imagined, that the law can in any ca&s;e pardon or over|look
a riotous entry or de&s;truction of the building, by a
multitude from without; who in this rude fa&s;hion arrogate
to them&s;elves the judgment and redre&s;s of the wrong, which
does not in anywi&s;e belong to them. This &s;eems to have
been the ground of repelling the defences in the ca&s;e of
John and George Sinclairs of Barrack and others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 13. &amp; 20. 1699.</NOTE> who were

<P>4. THE fourth and la&s;t circum&s;tance of this tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is accounted a Pri&s;on.</NOTE>
that the place from which the pri&s;oner e&s;capes be a proper,

and occa&s;ional places of cu&s;tody, may al&s;o be a crime,
e&s;pecially if it is accompli&s;hed by means of violence, or is
attended with tumult; but it cannot be libelled as the crime
of breaking pri&s;on. In the afore&s;aid ca&s;e of Sinclairs, the
double objection was moved, that the pri&s;on was but a barony
pri&s;on, and that the pri&s;oners had not been confined in the
proper <HI>tolbooth,</HI> but in another and private place of keeping.
The interlocutor requires the breaking of the <HI>public</HI> pri&s;on,
and repels the other defences.</P>
<P>5. THE pains of law for this offence are not determined by
any &s;tatute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Law for this Crime.</NOTE> and will be accommodated to the circum&s;tances
of the ca&s;e; according to the manner of the e&s;cape (by vio|lence,
or by &s;tealth, or upon opportunity given); according to
the quality of the cau&s;e of confinement, (as it is civil or crimi|nal,
capital or otherwi&s;e); and, in the ca&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from
without, (for the a&s;&s;i&s;ters are art and part of the crime), ac|cording
to the nature and degree of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It
&s;hould &s;eem, that, in general, the a&s;&s;i&s;tant has le&s;s excu&s;e than
the pri&s;oner him&s;elf, for whom the love of life and freedom
pleadeth. But in this &s;omething will depend, not only on the
degree of the outrage that is offered to the public cu&s;tody in
conducting the e&s;cape, but al&s;o on the nature of the relation
between the pri&s;oner and the a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and the probable mo|tive
of the aid that has been lent; though it is not to be
imagined, that even in the mo&s;t favourable of tho&s;e &s;ituations
the offence cea&s;es to be an object of pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>THE natural and ordinary cour&s;e of puni&s;hment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Law for this Crime.</NOTE> is by
a renewal of that confinement from which the pannel has
unlawfully freed him&s;elf. The &s;entence is, however, &s;ome|times
carried farther. James Inglis was bani&s;hed Scotland
<PB N="203" REF="204">
for life; and John Pringle had &s;entence to be &s;courged.
And indeed it is not to be doubted, that even the&s;e pe|nalties
are not &s;ufficient, if the enlargement of pri&s;oners is
accompanied with great injury to the per&s;on of the gaoler,
or to the &s;trength of the fabric; and &s;till le&s;s, if it is ac|compli&s;hed
by the riotous a&s;&s;ault of an outrageous mul|titude,
which might it&s;elf be libelled as the &s;eparate of|fence
of mobbing, and of cour&s;e is a high aggravation,
and may be &s;o charged, of the crime of breaking pri|&s;on.
In the ca&s;e of Charles Weir and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 22. 1700.</NOTE> it was
found, that to have a hand in the violent effraction of the
building by a mob within burgh, or to be pre&s;ent and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing
at the effraction as a guard in arms, was &s;uch an act of
riot as inferred the pain of death. We &s;hall &s;ee that later
practice &s;eems to have departed from that opinion; but it
is certain, that the capital crime of fire-rai&s;ing is equally
committed by burning a gaol or any part thereof, as by
burning any private and ordinary habitation.</P>

of the &s;pecial circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e, and more parti|cularly
that the &s;aid printers have acknowledged their

the offenders in this way to &s;uch a correction as would now be
thought competent only to be inflicted under the warrant of

1673, Donald Campbell, for reflections injurious to
the Earl of Athole, Ju&s;tice-General, had &s;entence to &s;tand
two hours upon the cuck-&s;tool, and to crave pardon, and

Shaw, Spalding and others, for murder, and when &s;tanding

<PB N="209" REF="210">
and e&s;pecially of a re&s;olution to acquit Shaw, and fix the
murder upon Spalding.</P>
<P>II. As the law has been thus liberal of its protection to
Magi&s;trates and Judges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of offences by Judges again&s;t their office.</NOTE> in their per&s;on, fame, and dignity;
&s;o it holds them to be &s;trictly an&s;werable for the pure and di|ligent
di&s;charge of their important tru&s;t, and appoints them
to be puni&s;hed with grievous and degrading pains, if by any
&s;ort of corruption, or partiality, or even by neglect, they &s;hall
&s;uffer the channels of ju&s;tice to be polluted or ob&s;tructed.
And this with the highe&s;t rea&s;on; &s;ince by &s;uch malver&s;ation,
be&s;ide perverting the &s;alutary in&s;titutions of government, and
di&s;appointing the wi&s;dom and benignity of the laws of their
country, they even &s;hake the reverence of the people for the
law it&s;elf and the office of Judge, and le&s;&s;en their attach|ment
to the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution of the land.</P>
<P>I. THE meane&s;t and mo&s;t infamous of this cla&s;s of offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bribery in a Judge.</NOTE>
is that of bribery in a Judge; which is committed by the
&s;elling of his judgment for good deed or reward to him&s;elf:
meaning by this, not only his taking a bribe to decide again&s;t
his con&s;cience, but in general his taking to &s;how favour in
his office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">L. 4. tic. 11. Lib. 48. Dig.</NOTE> <HI>&startq;Quo magis aut minus quid ex officio &s;uo faceret.&endq;</HI>
This, in any of the Judges of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, is pu|ni&s;hed
by the &s;tatute 1579, c. 93. with infamy, lo&s;s of office,
and confi&s;cation of moveables, be&s;ide arbitrary puni&s;hment
in the per&s;on. And as to other Judges,&mdash;on compari&s;on of
the&s;e &s;tatutes; 1424, c. 45.; 1427, c. 107.; 1449, c. 17.
1457, c. 76.; 1469, c. 26.; 1540, c. 104. which either par|ticularly
mention bribery, or relate in general to the pu|ni&s;hment
of partial and faulty Judges; and which appear
to have pa&s;&s;ed, like tho&s;e on many other &s;ubjects, with|out
<PB N="210" REF="211">
out much regard to their con&s;i&s;tency with each other; the
re&s;ult upon the whole &s;eems to be, that bribery is &s;ubject to a
di&s;cretionary cen&s;ure, including, among other penalties, the
like lo&s;s of fame and office, be&s;ide payment of the party's
co&s;ts, and reparation of his damage<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mackenzie, in his Ob&s;ervations (p. 37.) on the &s;tatute 1449, c. 17. has &s;aid, &startq;And the puni&s;hment of Judges offending in their offices, is now arbitrary, &s;ui|table to the nature of the offence.&endq;</NOTE>. To what degree of
&s;everity the &s;entence may be carried, can hardly be eluci|dated
from the &s;tate of practice; for there &s;eems to be
but one trial of a Judge for bribery, upon record. On the 1&s;t
Augu&s;t 1687, William Fife, Bailie of the regality of Pai&s;ley,
was convicted of wrongous impri&s;onment, and of taking
a bribe on two occa&s;ions. But for &s;ome rea&s;on, of which
the record does not enable me to judge, the &s;entence was
not in terms even of the milde&s;t of the&s;e &s;tatutes; but for
impri&s;onment only during the plea&s;ure of the Court, and
for payment of L. 40 Scots, as damage to the party im|pri&s;oned.</P>
<P>LIKEWISE;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bribery in the Officers of Court.</NOTE> though none of the&s;e laws make mention of the
inferior officers of Court, &s;uch as clerks, fi&s;cals, macers,
and the like; yet it is not to be doubted, that for any of
the&s;e per&s;ons to take reward for &s;hewing favour in his de|partment,
is cogni&s;able at common law, as a &s;pecies of fal&s;e|hood
and breach of tru&s;t; for which he may be cha&s;ti&s;ed
with as high penalties, as any that the &s;tatutes have appoint|ed.
And upon &s;uch a charge, at lea&s;t if it be relative to
any recent occurrence, the Judges of the Court where the
wrong happens, are probably competent to determine <HI>de pla|no,</HI>
without an a&s;&s;ize, and upon a &s;ummary complaint.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="212">
WITH re&s;pect, al&s;o, to the giving, or even the offering of
a bribe to any one, whether Judge or officer of Court, who&s;e
&s;tation gives him a concern in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Giving or of|fering a Bribe is puni&s;hable.</NOTE>
(upon which matter the &s;tatutes are equally &s;ilent), the &s;ame
ob&s;ervation will apply. For, if even the bribing of a vote to|wards

and Demp&s;ter); and if the &s;ame be true, (as determined
in the ca&s;e of James Stein), of the attempt to bribe an officer
of the revenue; much more mu&s;t we be of the &s;ame opinion
concerning the &s;till more wicked and audacious enterpri&s;e of
corrupting the very &s;ources of public ju&s;tice; which mu&s;t
not only be pure, but exempt even from the &s;u&s;picion of ac|ce&s;&s;ibility
to any manner of influence, and chiefly to this,
the ba&s;e&s;t, mo&s;t dangerous, and mo&s;t degrading influence of
any. And here I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to &s;ay, in general, up|on
this head of bribery, that as the turpitude is undeniable of
&s;educing any &s;ervant of the public to betray his tru&s;t, what|&s;oever
be the object of it; &s;o there will be no doubt of the
competency, at common law, of inflicting an exemplary pu|ni&s;hment
on account of any, either &s;ucce&s;sful or un&s;uc|ce&s;sful,
if &s;erious endeavour, which is made towards &s;o foul
a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>2. IT is not only the corruption of a Judge that falls un|der
the &s;anction of the &s;tatutes above mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppre&s;&s;ion or Partiality of Judge.</NOTE> but al&s;o
his partiality, or his refu&s;al of ju&s;tice; and, in general, his
iniquitous and oppre&s;&s;ive conduct, if gro&s;s and wilful, and
made evident in a cour&s;e of ouvert and convincing facts.

3. As already hinted; it is even a point of dittay, if a
Judge or Magi&s;trate &s;hall either leave unperformed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neglect of Duty in Judges.</NOTE> or &s;hall
perform in a &s;lack and in&s;ufficient manner, any known and
capital point of his duty: which is more e&s;pecially true of
what relates to the detection or puni&s;hment of criminal offen|ders,
or to the pre&s;erving of the peace of his di&s;trict, or the
due authority of his office. For this he is as much bound to
maintain entire, as he is to be content with that mea&s;ure of
power and pre-eminence which by law belongs to his &s;tation.
This re&s;pon&s;ibility has been exemplified in various in&s;tan|ces.
In 1681, the Magi&s;trates of Lanark were fined, for ne|glecting
to oppo&s;e, or to pro&s;ecute, the per&s;ons who had
rai&s;ed a tumult in that burgh, on occa&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ing

to Judges, or in the exerci&s;e of powers of a judicial
nature, that this of neglect of duty, is acknowledged as a
point of criminal accu&s;ation. Even if our &s;tatutes were &s;ilent

<PB N="218" REF="219">
in this article declares and confirms the common law, (for it

<P>III. The crime of THEFTBUTE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theftbute, what it is.</NOTE> which al&s;o belongs to the
cla&s;s of offences again&s;t public ju&s;tice, is &s;o named from
the Saxon word <HI>Bute,</HI> &s;ignifying amends. It is committed
by compounding with a thief, to &s;ave him from pro&s;ecution.
That a per&s;on who&s;e goods have been &s;tolen, &s;imply takes
them again, and lets the thief go; though it is not a cour&s;e
<PB N="219" REF="220">
of conduct which the law can approve, will not however come
within the notion of theftbute; which implies &s;ome &s;ort of
corrupt compact with the thief, whereby the per&s;on who
has him in his power, barters the public ju&s;tice for profit
and lucre to him&s;elf. This, however, may either be done,
by taking a ran&s;om from the thief to di&s;mi&s;s him, (which
&s;eems to have been called the <HI>&s;elling of a thief</HI>), or by <HI>&s;ining with
him,</HI> that is, receiving a &s;hare of what he has &s;tolen, to pro|tect
him. For in either ca&s;e, the compounder &s;hews his
utter di&s;regard of the public intere&s;t, and not only encourages
the thief to per&s;i&s;t in his thieving, but is him&s;elf parta|ker
of a gain which ari&s;es out of it; and is thus invol|ved
in a &s;ort of guilt, &s;omewhat allied to that of &s;tealing,
or of re&s;etting &s;tolen goods. In this point of view the mat|ter
had been con&s;idered, at the date of our only general &s;tatute
on the &s;ubject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes again&s;t it.</NOTE> 1515, c. 2.; which treats the taker of theftbute
as art and part of the theft, and orders him &startq;to underly the
law and be accu&s;ed therefor as principal thief and rie|ver.&endq;
A prior &s;tatute, 1436, c. 137. but which &s;eems only
to relate to the ca&s;e of Magi&s;trates, (for the word <HI>uthers,</HI>
which occurs in the act, cannot well be carried farther than
to other <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> be&s;ide tho&s;e who are mentioned in the
&s;tatute), had ordained, that in the deeper and more &s;hameful
ca&s;e of <HI>their</HI> guilt, in whom the public tru&s;ts for the detection
of thieves, the puni&s;hment &s;hall be lo&s;s of life and confi&s;ca|tion
of goods. At lea&s;t, the&s;e are the pains denounced
again&s;t Sheriffs and Ju&s;ticiars; for the words of the act
are aukwardly enough di&s;po&s;ed, to occa&s;ion &s;ome difficulty
of applying the &s;ame &s;anction, (though probably intended by
the Legi&s;lature), to the ca&s;e of other Judges.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="221">
BUT although theftbute be &s;till a point of dittay, and
might probably have been &s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If now puni&s;hable in terms of the Statutes.</NOTE> though the Legi&s;lature had
&s;aid nothing on the &s;ubject; yet it may be que&s;tioned whe|ther
there is now &s;ufficient authority to pa&s;s judgment for
the <HI>&s;tatutory pains,</HI> at lea&s;t in the le&s;s aggravated ca&s;e of
an ordinary culprit. And this, not only on account of the
altered &s;ituation of the country, which does not now re|quire
the &s;ame &s;harp re&s;traint as formerly, of this corrupt
and pernicious &s;ort of compact; but becau&s;e, even in the
times which &s;tood more in need of &s;uch a remedy, the ri|gour
of the law, or even any pro&s;ecution of the offenders,
does not appear to have been in u&s;e. In &s;o much that up|wards
of a century ago,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crim. Part I.</NOTE> as Mackenzie has informed us, it had
become a point of controver&s;y,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 20. No. 1.</NOTE> and was agitated in the ca&s;e
of Angus Mackinto&s;h, whether the &s;tatutes had not been lo&s;t
by long neglect<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Mackenzie's account of this deci&s;ion is incorrect, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> In the date, which, as reported by Stair, is February 21. 1666. 2<HI>dly,</HI> In the &s;ub&s;tance of the deci&s;ion, for the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion did not re&s;olve to hear it them&s;elves, but advocated and remitted to the Ju&s;tices. 3<HI>dly,</HI> As far as appears, the debate was not about the competency of puni&s;hing the offence, but about the nature of the crime, and the competency of puni&s;hing <HI>in terms of the &s;tatutes.</HI></P>
<P>In his Ob&s;ervations on the &s;tatutes, p. 30. Mackenzie &s;ays, and probably with relation to this ca&s;e, (though he neither mentions date nor names of parties). that theftbute was found a crime, <HI>yet puni&s;hable.</HI> I have not found any &s;uch deci&s;ion in the Books of Adjournal; at any rate, the&s;e terms do not indicate a capital pain.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the giving of theftbute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Giving of Theftbute, if puni&s;hable.</NOTE>&mdash;I cannot find
that this had ever been held to be cogni&s;able as a &s;eparate
offence. But if we may tru&s;t to the laws of William, and
of Robert I.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Stat. Wilh. c. 15.&mdash;Stat. Inea. R. I. c. 9.</NOTE>; &s;uch was the weight of this circum&s;tance
<PB N="221" REF="222">
as a pre&s;umption of the guilt of <HI>theft,</HI> that the giver was on
this &s;ingle ground to be held as a thief convicted, and to be
di&s;po&s;ed of accordingly. This might be agreeable to the
character of the juri&s;prudence of tho&s;e times, and e&s;peci|ally
to that article of the practice concerning theft, by
which a per&s;on was liable to death upon the mere <HI>bruit</HI> and
defamation of the neighbourhood. But &s;uch a circum&s;tance
could not now be con&s;idered any otherwi&s;e, than as one
ground of &s;u&s;picion along with others.</P>
<P>IV. THESE &s;eem to be a &s;ummary of the chief offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wilful Error upon A&s;&s;ize.</NOTE> of
which the law now takes cogni&s;ance as ho&s;tile to the cour&s;e of
public ju&s;tice. But as relative to the practice of former times,
there is one more to be added to the li&s;t, and among the
mo&s;t important of any in its con&s;equences, that of the <HI>temera|rium
perjurium &s;upper a&s;&s;izam,</HI> or ra&s;h and wilful error upon a&s;|&s;ize.
This tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, according to the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem,</HI>
b. 1. c. 14. which is referred to and confirmed by &s;tat. 1475,
c. 63. was to be puni&s;hed with the &s;evere pains of infamy,
e&s;cheat of moveables, and impri&s;onment for year and day.</P>
<P>THAT it is equally a point of dittay for a juryman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of that Offence.</NOTE> as for
a Judge, to be corrupted by bribe or reward, and to return
a fal&s;e verdict, contrary to the tru&s;t of his office, and the &s;o|lemn
oath which he has taken to do ju&s;tice between the par|ties;
this never could be doubted to be law. But that to which
I now allude, is quite a different, and a far more exception|able
&s;ort of charge; which was made without the warrant of
any favour received by the juror, or even of any &s;olicita|tion
or improper practice with re&s;pect to him, from which
corruption might rea&s;onably be inferred; and on the &s;ingle
ground of verdict of acquittal having been returned by the
a&s;&s;ize, contrary to what, in the pro&s;ecutor's e&s;timation, was
<PB N="222" REF="223">
clear and &s;ufficient evidence for condemnation; &s;o that the
error being palpable and manife&s;t, was therein to be held as
proved to be a corrupt and wilful error too.</P>
<P>THAT this was the proper notion of the offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds for convicting of it.</NOTE> and of the
competent grounds for convicting of it, in particular appears
from that clau&s;e of the act 1475, c. 63. which regulates the
trial of the jurors on &s;uch a charge, and appoints the pro|&s;ecutor
to produce as proof again&s;t them, &startq;the evidents or
notour knowledge of the tre&s;pa&s;&s;e, in &s;a far as was &s;chawen
to the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ize;&endq; meaning by this, <HI>the very proof of guilt</HI>
which was di&s;regarded in the fir&s;t trial, by the per&s;ons of
a&s;&s;ize who are accu&s;ed of wilful error. Accordingly, after
a full argument on this que&s;tion, judgment was given to that
effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18. 25. 27. 1681.</NOTE> in the ca&s;e of Alexander Blair and others
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame point had been debated at large, and with much ingenuity and learning, between Sir Thomas Hope and Ni&s;bet of Dirleton, (December 1635), upon the libel again&s;t Alexander Irving and others; but no deci&s;ion was given; the diet being de&s;erted by order of Council.</NOTE>, where
the depo&s;itions given upon the former trial were engro&s;&s;ed in
the libel; and where &s;everal of the pannels were convicted
on that one ground, and were condemned in the &s;tatutory
pains. Mackenzie too, in his ob&s;ervations on the foregoing
&s;tatute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 81.</NOTE> approves of this deci&s;ion, &startq;becau&s;e, (&s;ays he) the
error being <HI>clear,</HI> the error behoved nece&s;&s;arily to be <HI>wil|ful,</HI>
and by partial means; nor was it po&s;&s;ible to prove
the&s;e occult qualities, otherwi&s;e than <HI>ab effectu.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>THOUGH the text of the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem</HI> make no di|&s;tinction

though one expre&s;&s;ion towards the end of the &s;tatute 1475,
<PB N="223" REF="224">
(&startq;outher to be convict or made quit&endq;), may &s;eem to be fa|vourable
to the &s;ame opinion; it is clear upon the principal
enactment and the &s;anction of that law, and &s;till more upon
the cour&s;e of practice, which does not afford a &s;ingle in|&s;tance
of libel rai&s;ed again&s;t an a&s;&s;ize for a ra&s;h conviction,
that the only danger which had been thought nece&s;&s;ary to
be guarded again&s;t in this manner, was that of favour in
ab&s;olving the pannel. It is true, that at inclo&s;ing the jury,
the pannel's coun&s;el appear often to have prote&s;ted for a&s;&s;ize
of error, in ca&s;e they &s;hould condemn, (as in the ca&s;e of Fra|zer,
30th July 1641, of Finnie, December 1664, and George
Graham, November 11. 1663); yet in tho&s;e very ca&s;es, no
pro&s;ecution followed, though the pannel was found guilty.
Indeed, as the act 1475 declares, that the fir&s;t verdict &s;hall
&s;tand good and have its cour&s;e; this extraordinary conclu&s;ion
would have followed on the oppo&s;ite opinion, as applied to
any capital ca&s;e, that the jury were to be puni&s;hed for con|victing
the pannel, but the man was to be executed never|thele&s;s.</P>

was a &s;ettled point in practice, (though Mackenzie inclines to

<P>THOUGH criminal trials were the mo&s;t improper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fal&s;e Verdict on retorable Brieves was puni&s;hable.</NOTE> they were
not, however, the only trials, upon which a jury were liable
<PB N="224" REF="225">
to this &s;ort of challenge; as appears from the &s;tatutes 1471,
c. 47. 1617, c. 13. which apply the &s;ame remedy to the ca&s;e
of fal&s;e verdict upon any of the retourable brieves. But
there was this material difference with re&s;pect to the i&s;&s;ue of
the complaint in the two departments, that the acquitted cri|minal
had the full benefit of the verdict in his favour, not|with&s;tanding
the attaint of the a&s;&s;ize; whereas, by expre&s;s
order of the &s;tatute 1471, relative to the verdict upon the ci|vil
intere&s;t, this was to be &s;et a&s;ide at the &s;ame time that the
a&s;&s;izers were to be puni&s;hed for their fault. It may al&s;o
be mentioned, that the challenge of a&s;&s;izers making fal&s;e re|tour
of &s;ervice, was, by act 1617, c. 13. limited to three
years from the date of the verdict; which &s;eems to have been
a peculiar provi&s;ion for that &s;ingle ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IN either province of right, the manner of trial was the
&s;ame, in terms of the act 1475; being either by verdict of a
great a&s;&s;ize of 25 <HI>noble per&s;ons,</HI> (in practice con&s;trued to mean
<HI>landed men</HI>), or, (which was the cour&s;e more commonly adopt|ed,
as a means of mollifying the pro&s;ecutor), by confe&s;&s;ion
of party made before the Court; which &s;ort of proceed|ing,
in this ca&s;e perhaps alone in the whole circuit of the
law, was thus made a competent ground of conviction and
&s;entence.</P>
<P>IN order to the preparing of the charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Trial for this Crime.</NOTE> and the &s;electing
of the proper pannels, the act 1475 empowered the Privy
Council to call the a&s;&s;ize before them, and require them &s;e|verally
to di&s;clo&s;e their votes; and with the &s;ame view, the
regulations of judicial procedure made in 1672, enjoined the
Chancellor of a&s;&s;ize, in making out the verdict, to di&s;tingui&s;h
the vote of each a&s;&s;izer, by a note &s;ubjoined to his name. If
<PB N="225" REF="226">
this was omitted, the guilt of the acquittal attached by pre|&s;umption
to the whole a&s;&s;ize, and it lay with any one who
had voted for condemning, to bring evidence of this fact
in his own vindication.</P>
<P>THE &s;ingle in&s;tance of conviction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;tances of Trial for it.</NOTE> or indeed of trial be|fore
a great a&s;&s;ize, for this &s;ort of perjury, is the ca&s;e already
mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18. 25. 27. and Aug. 3. 1681.</NOTE> of Alexander Blair, James Baillie, and James
Gray, who were accu&s;ed of acquitting certain per&s;ons, upon
their trial in ab&s;ence, for trea&s;on. They had &s;entence of
e&s;cheat of moveables, infamy, forfeiture of the benefit of
the law, and to be impri&s;oned for year and day. In &s;everal
other in&s;tances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 30. 1576. May 27. 1607. Dec. 1635.</NOTE> pro&s;ecution was commenced for wilful error;
but in &s;ome of them the diet was de&s;erted, and in others
the pannels came in the King's will, and were fined.</P>
<P>IT is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to remark how incon&s;i&s;tent &s;uch
a challenge was with the principle of a trial by jury;<NOTE PLACE="marg">When aboli&s;hed.</NOTE> or
to enlarge upon the evil con&s;equences which might en&s;ue
from the &s;tate of fear and con&s;traint, in which jurors were
thus inclo&s;ed to determine on the lives and deare&s;t inte|re&s;ts

of the Lieges.</HI> Under which general appellation our

met with the intention of doing mi&s;chief, which is an <HI>un|lawful
a&s;&s;embly;</HI> this is a con&s;ideration which, in our practice,
&s;eems to affect only the mea&s;ure of the puni&s;hment, and
in nowi&s;e the &s;tyle under which the offence falls to be char|ged
in the indictment: provided always the meeting be at|tended
<PB N="227" REF="228">
tended with tho&s;e circum&s;tances of di&s;order and alarm,
which make it a puni&s;hable meeting.</P>
<P>I. THE crime being thus &s;o various in kind and degree, I
&s;hall not attempt to circum&s;cribe the thing in any definition;
but &s;hall rather allow the notion of it to be gathered from an
inquiry concerning the &s;everal particulars which are nece&s;|&s;ary
towards the conviction of any offender in this kind.</P>
<P>1. THE mo&s;t obvious circum&s;tance is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t be the A&s;|&s;embly of a Number.</NOTE> that a great ho&s;t or
multitude of people mu&s;t be a&s;&s;embled. For herein it is,&mdash;in
the appearance of power, as well as di&s;po&s;ition to execute their
unlawful purpo&s;es, of their own will and authority, that the
alarm and danger of &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies lies. But as to the lowe&s;t
number that will in any ca&s;e &s;uffice to make a mob; I have
found nothing in our records, which even tends to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of any con&s;tant rule. And truly this is a matter
of that &s;ort, which is better left open to be decided upon the
circum&s;tances of each ca&s;e; according to the a&s;pect and
purpo&s;e of the meeting, and the nature and degree of the
exce&s;&s;es to which they have proceeded. The higher the&s;e are,
the le&s;s the number that will be nece&s;&s;ary to bring their of|fence
within the notion of a mob; as, on the other &s;ide,
inferior outrages will &s;u&s;tain the charge, if they are the act
of a great ho&s;t or multitude, whereof the very convocation
is it&s;elf a terror and &s;ubject of alarm.</P>
<P>2. THE a&s;&s;embly mu&s;t be de&s;cribed as that which is to
the fear of the lieges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;embly mu&s;t be to the &s;ear of the Lieges.</NOTE> and the di&s;turbance of the pub|lic
peace; being accompanied with &s;uch circum&s;tances
of actual violence, or of plain tendency thereto, as be|get
a rea&s;onable apprehen&s;ion of what may en&s;ue. It will
<PB N="228" REF="229">
not, therefore, always affix the character of a mob to any
meeting, that it is a meetin for a wrong and an unlawful pur|po&s;e,
were it even &s;uch as is forbidden under pain of death;
if the bu&s;ine&s;s may be withal, and actually is tran&s;acted, in
a regular and quiet manner, without any circum&s;tance of
open di&s;order or commotion. Thus the a&s;&s;embling to ce|lebrate
ma&s;s, is, by certain &s;tatutes, a capital crime; and
the a&s;&s;embling to contrive the death of the King, is an ou|vert
act of trea&s;on; for which the offenders may certainly
be arre&s;ted on the &s;pot, and dealt with according to their
guilt: but &s;till not as rioters; having convened, as for &s;uch
a purpo&s;e they naturally will, with all the precautions of &s;e|crecy
and retirement. If this be true of criminal conven|tions
&s;uch as the&s;e; much more will the &s;ame hold good
of tho&s;e meetings, though noi&s;y and bu&s;tling, which are for
innocent or allowable purpo&s;es, &s;uch as foot-ball, racing,
cock-fighting, and the like; none of which pa&s;times are to
the di&s;quiet nor unea&s;ine&s;s of the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>As a multitude may be convened for a criminal purpo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May be done by an A&s;&s;embly for a lawful Act.</NOTE>
without being guilty of mobbing; &s;o it is po&s;&s;ible, on the
other &s;ide, that this crime may be committed in the execu|tion
even of a lawful act, if the manner of it be irregular
and tumultuous. Thus, a Sheriff, a Ju&s;tice of Peace, and
on &s;ome occa&s;ions a me&s;&s;enger, con&s;table, or revenue-officer,
has right to command the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the neighbourhood,
towards execution of the duty of his office. But it becomes
all the&s;e per&s;ons to confine the exerci&s;e of this delicate pri|vilege
to the proper ca&s;es, and to proceed therein in a tempe|rate
and orderly cour&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;orderly exe|cution of Dili|gence.</NOTE> If, therefore, a me&s;&s;enger, being em|ployed

<PB N="229" REF="230">
the cloak of a pretended fear, he &s;hall levy and carry along
with him a great ho&s;t of armed and di&s;orderly people, who,

and banner, and a multitude of followers, and predoniou&s;ly
enter, in&s;ult and &s;eize, where&s;oever he cho&s;e to &s;u&s;pect.
The i&s;&s;ue of &s;uch charges will, however, be always affected
by any rea&s;onable fear of violence, which is &s;hown on the part
of the pannel; as in the ca&s;e of executing diligence again&s;t
a per&s;on who is known to be in the u&s;e of deforcing the offi|cers
of the law, and who keeps a garri&s;on of armed men in
his hou&s;e, for his protection. And on this ground, probably,
went the interlocutor &s;u&s;taining the defence in a ca&s;e where
an allegation of this &s;ort was made; the ca&s;e of Keith, Gor|don
and Innes, January 11. 1692<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Found the libel as to convocation to the number of forty or fifty per&s;ons, with the arms, libelled, relevant to infer the pains of the acts of Parliament; but &s;ound that defence of the pannels Mr Robert Keith and James Gordon, that they were in the execution of a caption, al&s;o relevant to elide the libel <HI>&s;im|pliciter, quead</HI> the <HI>convocation.</HI>&endq;</NOTE>. In the now better di&s;ci|plined
condition of the country, &s;uch a plea would, however,
be received with greater difficulty than it was in former
times.</P>
<P>3. THE convocation mu&s;t not only have a tendency
towards violence and mi&s;chief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t be a com|bination for Vio|lence.</NOTE> but it mu&s;t al&s;o con&s;i&s;t of
per&s;ons, who are <HI>combined</HI> for &s;ome purpo&s;e of that kind.
It is the <HI>union</HI> and re&s;olution of a multitude, who are in
league to defy authority, and to execute their plea&s;ure by
means of force; by that means whereof the employment be|longs
to the &s;upreme power alone; that is the aggravat|ing
quality of the crime of mobbing. And in this it is di|&s;tingui&s;hed
from a pure ca&s;ual affray, or &s;udden quarrel break|ing
out among per&s;ons, how numerous &s;oever, who have
no &s;uch ho&s;tile views again&s;t the peace of the neighbourhood.
In vulgar &s;peech, &s;uch a &s;cene may &s;ometimes be called
<PB N="231" REF="232">
a riot; but in truth it is an offence of a far lower kind: For
a &s;udden broil of this fort, which may ari&s;e any how, &s;hows
no rebellious temper nor determination of the a&s;&s;embly up|on
mi&s;chief, from which the continuance or farther growth
of the di&s;order may be dreaded. I do not, however, mean to
&s;ay, that there cannot be a mob without a previous compact,
which was &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among the per&s;ons concerned, at the time
when they fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled. There may be, and often is, a &s;ub|&s;tantial
and &s;ufficient, though &s;udden and tumultuary con|&s;ent
on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and among per&s;ons who at meeting
had no &s;ettled purpo&s;e of mi&s;chief. And wherever this fort
of tacit confederacy is evident in the behaviour and pro|ceedings
of the body, the ca&s;e is materially different from that
of a quarrel or occa&s;ional outrage, which is not conducted
upon any common principle of contempt, but is the peculiar
concern of tho&s;e individuals who take an active part in it.
If this be true of the whole body, at the time when they
move upon their project; it is no le&s;s plain, with re&s;pect to
any individual who joins them after they are on foot, and
have declared their unlawful purpo&s;e, that he thus becomes
partaker of the guilt of their enterpri&s;e, and is puni&s;hable in
the &s;ame manner, as if he had been engaged in it from the
fir&s;t.</P>
<P>4. TOUCHING the nature of the project in a ca&s;e of mobbing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t be for an object of private Concern.</NOTE>
it is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, (and herein lies the main difference
between that crime and trea&s;on), that it is always a matter
of private concern. This is to be under&s;tood of private, as
in oppo&s;ition to national concern, or the intere&s;ts of State:
&s;uch as the reformation of the government; the lowering
of taxes; the throwing down of all inclo&s;ures; the repeal
or the pa&s;&s;ing of a public law; and other the like matters of
general and not of local or peculiar intere&s;t. Of which
<PB N="232" REF="233">
la&s;t kind are &s;uch objects as the&s;e: to reduce the price of
grain in the market of a particular place; to re&s;cue &s;uch
a criminal from execution; to hinder the divi&s;ion of the
town's common, or the like. Two tumults have happened in
Scotland, which may be thought to have been in this re&s;pect
of &s;omewhat an ambiguous character: I mean the great mob
at Gla&s;gow, in 1725, commonly called <HI>Shawfield's Mob,</HI> which
happened on occa&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ing of the malt-tax; and
the &s;till more con&s;iderable tumult in Edinburgh, commonly
called <HI>the Porteous Mob,</HI> which took upon it&s;elf the execution
of a per&s;on, who was indeed under &s;entence of death, but
had received a re&s;pite, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fore|runner
of a pardon. Yet I think; that in both in&s;tances, and
under the whole circum&s;tances of the fact, the pro&s;ecution
was brought more properly for mobbing only; as will be
more fully &s;hown under the head of trea&s;on. If the &s;ame
things had been done by an a&s;&s;ociation of numbers from dif|ferent
quarters of the country, and on a declared purpo&s;e
of travelling through Scotland to do the like, &s;o as to
compel the repeal of the malt-tax act, or to hinder in every
in&s;tance the operation of the royal pardons; certainly &s;uch
a project, though the a&s;&s;embly were not attended with all
the apparatus of an army, would have been a levying of
war again&s;t the King, and an act of trea&s;on under the &s;ta|tute
of Edward.</P>
<P>5. WE have al&s;o to inquire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the requi&s;ite degree of Vio|lence.</NOTE> how far the a&s;&s;embly mu&s;t
carry their di&s;turbance of the public peace, to incur the
guilt of mobbing. Now, with re&s;pect to this; it is certain
that they become a mob by de&s;troying, riffling, or in any
manner of way damaging, &s;eizing, or invading, the property
either of individuals or the public. As al&s;o by any manner
of injury done to the per&s;ons of individuals; or by inva&s;ion,

their own price,&mdash;to refu&s;e working at the ordinary rate of
labour,&mdash;to give orders for relea&s;e of pri&s;oners, or the like. It

IT is al&s;o certain, that although the a&s;&s;embly have not pro|ceeded
to acts of force or outrage; yet if once, if any way,
they have plainly di&s;covered their purpo&s;e of &s;ome violent
enterpri&s;e, and have made a movement, or taken any mea&s;ure
towards immediate execution of it, this too, in the under&s;tand|ing
of law, amounts to an act of mobbing. If, for in&s;tance,
a multitude a&s;&s;emble in the &s;treets of a burgh, and take the
road in a body to a certain mill, with the declared purpo&s;e
of &s;eizing the miller's grain; although, owing to panic,
or to intelligence that a force is provided again&s;t them,
they &s;hould di&s;per&s;e by the way, and without doing harm to
<PB N="235" REF="236">
property or per&s;on; &s;till they are guilty of a riot: becau&s;e
of the great commotion and breach of the public peace;
as well as that their malice has taken a determinate cour&s;e,
by which the individual is put in fear, and &s;ome advance
is made in the pur&s;uit of the particular object. A &s;epa|rate
charge of this character was &s;ent to the a&s;&s;ize along
with the others, in the ca&s;e of John Fra&s;er, of the 26th July
1784: it related to a meditated attack on the hou&s;e of
the Sheriff of Edinburgh; for which purpo&s;e the mob went
thither, but retired without doing any damage, on finding
that a force was &s;tationed there, to repel them.</P>
<P>As already intimated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is tumultuous a&s;&s;embling &s;uffi|cient without acts of Violence?</NOTE> our term of <HI>Mobbing</HI> or <HI>Convocation

and &s;uch as reaches the bare act of being tumultuou&s;ly a&s;&s;em|bled
for a violent purpo&s;e, though no farther movement be
made toward execution of the unlawful project. If a great
ho&s;t of people a&s;&s;emble upon the &s;treets of a burgh by beat of
drum, and with &s;omething hoi&s;ted by way of &s;tandard, and
continue to parade there for a length of time, in contempt
of the peace-officers; providing them&s;elves al&s;o with wea|pons,
increa&s;ing their numbers, communicating by a watch|word,
making declaration of &s;ome violent purpo&s;e, and with
loud clamours, and angry &s;peeches and ge&s;tures, deterring all
interference with them; this, of it&s;elf, makes a mob, inde|pendently
of the appearance of any Magi&s;trate, to warn them
by reading the riot-act. For though no farther outrage
en&s;ue, at lea&s;t this great harm is done, that the peace of the
neighbourhood is broken; the individuals are alarmed who
know them&s;elves to be the objects of the&s;e preparations; and
all the idle and licentious are put in motion, in the hope
of farther mi&s;chief. In the ca&s;e, accordingly, of Peter

the act of a&s;&s;embling within burgh in arms; which indeed,
without the help of any other circum&s;tance, is it&s;elf a plain
preparation of violence, and being &s;o unu&s;ual an occurrence,
carries rumour, alarm, and agitation abroad with it, among
the people.</P>
<P>IN this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of art and part of Mobbing.</NOTE> and before proceeding to inquire con|cerning
the puni&s;hment of mobbing, it will be proper to
attend to the doctrine of art and part, as applicable to
this offence, which is not of the &s;ame &s;imple nature as
mo&s;t other crimes, but often con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
parts, which are performed by different per&s;ons, and on
&s;everal occa&s;ions. It is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to remark, that
in this in&s;tance, as in others, a&s;&s;i&s;tance is not held to con|&s;i&s;t
exclu&s;ively in the lending of hands to do the acts of
<PB N="237" REF="238">
violence which are perpetrated; but equally in every other
proceeding which occa&s;ions, facilitates, encourages, or in
anywi&s;e contributes to promote the common enterpri&s;e: &s;o
that he who beats a drum to convocate the rioters, or who
reviles the Magi&s;trate that comes to di&s;per&s;e them, or who
goes among the multitude and exhorts them to per&s;i&s;t, or di|&s;tributes
liquor or money to them, to encourage them, is doubt|le&s;s
art and part of all the outrages of which they are guilty
at that time. For this &s;ort of heartening and countenance,
as &s;ab&s;tantially forwards the enterpri&s;e upon the whole, as
the aid of hands or force of body, in the execution of their
unlawful doings. I mu&s;t here again take notice of the ca&s;e of
John Fra&s;er,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 27. and Aug. 6. 1784.</NOTE> who was adjudged to be tran&s;ported for life, upon
conviction to this effect, &startq;that he was pre&s;ent and active in
the mob and riotous a&s;&s;embly libelled, and that he gro&s;sly
in&s;ulted and abu&s;ed the Sheriff, Mr Cockburn, in execution
of his duty.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 24. 1784.</NOTE> The conviction of Paul and Ander&s;on was
in the&s;e words: That they were guilty &startq;of exciting and
in&s;tigating a mob by beating a drum;&endq; and of William
Wel&s;h, that he &startq;was concerned in exciting the mob, but
in a le&s;s degree.&endq; Upon which verdict the two former
were puni&s;hed with &s;courging and tran&s;portation for fourteen
years; and Wel&s;h with impri&s;onment for &s;ix months, and
until he &s;hould find &s;ecurity to keep the peace for the &s;pace
of two years. This rule is farther exemplified in the ca&s;e of
Captain Walter Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 14. &amp; 27. 1722.</NOTE> who was &s;ined in L. 1000 Scots,
in pur&s;uance of a verdict which convicted him of uttering
words of command or exhortation to an act of violence<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Find it proven, that John Clelland, one of the pannels, &s;truck Bailie Se|ton with the but-end of his mu&s;ket, as he was going up the Council-hou&s;e &s;tairs; and that the &s;aid Captain Walter Hamilton, by u&s;ing the&s;e words, <HI>Keep him down,</HI> or, <HI>Knock him down,</HI> is guilty art and part in the terms of the Lords interlocutor.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="239">
IT is even a po&s;&s;ible thing, that a per&s;on may ju&s;tly be
convicted as art and part of a riot by in&s;tigating and exci|ting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and part by In&s;tigation.</NOTE>
though he be not pre&s;ent on the &s;pot where the acts of
violence are done. For if he be in &s;uch &s;ituation, that he
communicates with the active per&s;ons, and directs or has a
plain influence on their motions, as by &s;ending money or
liquor to them from &s;ome &s;hort di&s;tance; the only differ|ence
between him and them is in point of prudence, or of
boldne&s;s, and nowi&s;e in point of guilt. One in&s;tance of con|viction
upon &s;uch a ground, (though certainly not to be men|tioned
as an example of the ju&s;t or proper application of
this rule), is the ca&s;e of Alexander Keith, February 26.
1686; who was found art and part of a &s;editious meeting,
along with certain other per&s;ons, in an alehou&s;e, where they
drank &s;ucce&s;s to tho&s;e who were engaged in a riot on the
&s;treet at the time, and promi&s;ed liquor and money to all who
would go forth and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their purpo&s;e<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;The jury find the pannel Alexander Keith, guilty and culpable of being pre&s;ent at the &s;editious a&s;&s;embly, or meeting mentioned in his dittary, and of his joining with his accomplices, in his unlawful re&s;olutions, and order to a tu|mult; and art and part of the &s;ame &s;editious meeting, in re&s;pect they find the &s;amin &s;ufficiently proven by the witne&s;&s;es depo&s;itions.&endq;</NOTE>. The defect
of this ca&s;e was, that the libel did not charge, nor did
the verdict di&s;tinctly find, that any &s;ort of intercour&s;e or
concert took place between Keith and any of the per&s;ons
who were active in the tumult, nor that any one engaged
in it at his de&s;ire or in&s;tigation; &s;o that the accu&s;ation
<PB N="239" REF="240">
amounted to little more than the uttering of expre&s;&s;ions of fa|vour
to their cau&s;e. Keith, however, had &s;entence of death.</P>
<P>IN the next place;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and part by Pre&s;ence.</NOTE> with re&s;pect to him who is pre&s;ent in
the mob, and witne&s;s of the riotous proceedings, the que&s;|tion
ari&s;es, whether he is art and part of their offence pure|ly
by his pre&s;ence, although no circum&s;tance of activity or
co-operation be proved again&s;t him. Now, as to this mat|ter;
the only general doctrine that &s;eems &s;it to be deli|vered,
amounts to no more than this, that the que&s;tion de|pends
upon the <HI>animus</HI> or purpo&s;e with which the pannel
mingles in the a&s;&s;embly: in judging whereof, all the cir|cum&s;tances
of his &s;ituation will of cour&s;e be weighed, and
a different deci&s;ion be therefore given, according as upon
the whole evidence in the ca&s;e, his pre&s;ence &s;hall appear to
have been accidental only, or owing to indi&s;cretion, or with
a purpo&s;e to countenance and abet the unlawful doings.
Thus, on the &s;treets of a burgh, a per&s;on may, for a &s;hort
time, be found among a mob, either innocently, or at lea&s;t
excu&s;ably; being perhaps impeded by them in his pa&s;&s;age,
or having &s;topped for a while to look at their proceedings, or
to inquire what they are about: and though he &s;hould even
follow them for a &s;hort way, and linger in the rear of the
multitude, it would be &s;evere to con&s;true this into an acce&s;|&s;ion,
which may be mere heedle&s;sne&s;s, or idle curio&s;ity. In
this &s;en&s;e, I interpret the words of the verdict in the ca&s;e of
David Black,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 26. 1720.</NOTE> and others &startq;finds it proven, that David
Black, Elias Ro&s;s, and James Bred, were only in compa|ny
with that number of people convened upon the &s;ands of
Ely;&endq; upon which the&s;e per&s;ons were a&s;&s;oilzied, as not
being convicted of having <HI>joined,</HI> (in any proper &s;en&s;e), or be|come
part of the riotous body.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="241">
BUT, if a man is found in the throng, with his face black|ed,
or in woman's apparel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and part of mobbing by Pre|&s;ence.</NOTE> or with a &s;hirt over his coat; or
if upon &s;earch, a loaded pi&s;tol or a parcel of &s;editious hand|bills
is found upon him; or if it be proved that he u&s;ed the
watch-word of the rioters, or that he wore in his hat the badge
of the friends of the cau&s;e for that day; in all the&s;e and the
like ca&s;es, his pre&s;ence is circum&s;tanced in &s;uch a manner, as
fixes the purpo&s;e and di&s;po&s;ition with which he came there;
and is a ju&s;t ground for convicting him as art and part, though
there be no proof that he ever &s;howed his arms, or hawked
the hand-bills, or gave a&s;&s;i&s;tance of deed, word, or ge&s;ture,
in the executive part of the bu&s;ine&s;s. In like manner, with|out
the te&s;timony of circum&s;tances &s;o deci&s;ive as the&s;e, &s;u&s;ficient
evidence may &s;till be found to the &s;ame effect, in the
length of time that the pannel has continued in the mob, or the
length of way he has gone along with them; if they be &s;uch
as are not rea&s;onably to be reconciled with any other opinion
of his intention. If, for in&s;tance, at midnight, when he
ought to be with his family, and in bed, a mechanic or
working man is found in a mob at the di&s;tance of miles
from his home, and is proved to have accompanied them
from place to place, and on all tho&s;e occa&s;ions to have
been in the throng of them, and without any pretence of
lawful bu&s;ine&s;s in that quarter of the country; what other
opinion can be formed of him, but that he is an a&s;&s;o|ciate
in the enterpri&s;e; and is there to favour and promote
it? In all ca&s;es, therefore, where pre&s;ence is attended with
the due accompaniments of this kind, it is by it&s;elf a law|ful
ground of conviction. In truth, the pre&s;ence of any
one who joins the multitude in this fa&s;hion, is it&s;elf a real
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;ince it adds to their number, confidence, and
apparent force, and to the attendant terror and alarm,
which are their engines for execution of their lawle&s;s pro|ject.
<PB N="241" REF="242">
The Judge cannot therefore li&s;ten to the plea of cu|rio&s;ity
in &s;uch a ca&s;e. For a curio&s;ity of this anxious and
continued kind is not innocent nor excu&s;able; nor is it pure
nor &s;imple curio&s;ity, but attended with favour to what is go|ing
on: for who will put him&s;elf to &s;o much trouble, to be
a witne&s;s of proceedings which he heartily di&s;approves?</P>
<P>I SHALL refer the reader to the following judgments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Art and Part by Pre&s;ence.</NOTE> in evi|dence
of the a&s;&s;ent of our practice to this con&s;truction of the
law. On the 5th of Augu&s;t 1720, verdict was returned again&s;t
Thomas Gilkie, thus: &startq;Find it <HI>proven,</HI> that Thomas Gilkie
was <HI>in the mob</HI> at the time libelled; but <HI>not proven</HI> that he
was &s;een taking away victual or breaking of hou&s;es or
&s;hops.&endq; Upon which Gilkie, who was a burge&s;s of Dun|dee,
was adjudged to be &s;courged through that burgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 9. 1720.</NOTE> and
to lo&s;e his franchi&s;e as a burge&s;s, and to be incapable of the
&s;ame in future. In like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 9. and May 12. 1741.</NOTE> William Gilchri&s;t had
&s;entence of tran&s;portation for &s;even years, upon a verdict in
the&s;e terms: &startq;Find, that at the time libelled, the mill po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
by Charles Sawyers at Bell's Mills, was broke open
by a mob, and meal and kiln-pot oats carried off from
thence, and that the pannel was pre&s;ent <HI>at</HI> the &s;aid mob,
and <HI>while</HI> the meal was carried off; and do not find it pro|ven
that the pannel was compelled to go <HI>thither by force,</HI>
nor that he was under any re&s;traint while there; and, by
a plurality of voices, find no other part of the libel pro|ven.&endq;</P>
<P>A THIRD conviction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Art and Part by Pre&s;ence.</NOTE> nearly to the &s;ame effect, was that
of Richard Robert&s;on, on the 16th March 1773. &startq;The jury

Yet all the&s;e pannels were adjudged to &s;uffer high pains.
Balleny was twice pilloried; Buchanan, (who bore the gun),
and along with him Macfarlane and Hamilton, were &s;courged

<P>THIS que&s;tion may al&s;o ari&s;e concerning a per&s;on who is
pre&s;ent and actively engaged in a mob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Per&s;on Art and Part of one Act, is he of all?</NOTE> how far he is to be
held art and part of all their criminal proceedings. If a
great multitude &s;eparate, by agreement, into a number of
&s;maller bodies, which proceed to different places, where
they commit &s;undry outrages and mi&s;chiefs; here, though all
<PB N="243" REF="244">
be done in execution of one great plan, (as, for in&s;tance, if
they de&s;troy the gaols in the &s;everal quarters of the &s;ame
city); yet the proceedings of any one of the&s;e bodies are
only a proper charge again&s;t the per&s;ons who are pre&s;ent in
it, and witne&s;&s;es of what is done: &s;o that if one divi&s;ion,
after entering, have proceeded to burn a gaol, this cannot
be charged again&s;t the individuals in another party, who
have not gone to the &s;ame exce&s;s; whether this be owing
to want of inclination, or to other cau&s;es. Neverthele&s;s,
in fixing the puni&s;hment of the &s;everal convicts, regard may
certainly be had to this circum&s;tance, that the &s;everal out|rages
are proved to be parts of the &s;ame commotion, and of
one great and exten&s;ive &s;cheme of mi&s;chief, wherein all the
per&s;ons, in all the different parties, were leagued; and which
thus &s;erves to aggravate the guilt of the particular proceed|ings
of every portion of the confederates. The &s;ame &s;eems
to be true with re&s;pect to any individual, who meets a mob
upon their pa&s;&s;age, after execution of one outrageous act,
and who knowing this, proceeds with them to &s;ome other
quarter, where they complete their purpo&s;e. For although,
properly &s;peaking, he is not art and part of what was done
before he joined the meeting, &s;o as to be &s;pecially chargeable
with it in a libel; yet is he the more guilty, that he wil|fully
a&s;&s;ociates him&s;elf to a &s;et of per&s;ons who have already
proceeded to &s;uch exce&s;&s;es. This is even applicable to a tu|mult,
which has a continuance for days: Tho&s;e who engage
in the proceedings of the la&s;t days, are puni&s;hable the more
&s;everely on account of the di&s;orders of the former days,
which they deliberately ratify, when they join the force
which has been guilty of them, and renew the tumult.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="245">
BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of one Act; is it of all?</NOTE> though it may in the ca&s;e of &s;o exten&s;ive a commo|tion,
it will not in the common ca&s;e be nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o nearly to
con&s;ider the degrees of activity of the &s;everal offenders, or the
particular acts of violence in which they have has a part.
In the con&s;truction of law, (and it cannot in rea&s;on be any
other), every member of the riotous a&s;&s;embly is art and part of
all the violences which are committed by any portion of that
a&s;&s;embly, while he continues in it; if they are the natural
and ordinary accompaniments of &s;uch a tumult, and are not
quite out of the verge and bounds of the original enterpri&s;e;
for they, all of them, &s;uffer the things to be done, and are, by
their a&s;&s;embly, the cau&s;e why &s;uch things are po&s;&s;ible to be
done, and are not re&s;i&s;ted. In the ca&s;e, therefore, of an ordi|nary
mob, all the in&s;ults offered to pa&s;&s;engers, all the hin|derance
and ob&s;truction of Magi&s;trates and officers of the
law, all the threats of mi&s;chief to property and per&s;on, and in
general, all the di&s;turbance, agitation and terror natural to
&s;uch occa&s;ions, are chargeable alike, again&s;t all the per&s;ons
who are on foot. In like manner, if a mob &s;et out with the
declared re&s;olution of burning a certain hou&s;e, or killing a
certain per&s;on, which re&s;olution they accordingly execute;
doubtle&s;s the guilt of the fire-rai&s;ing or murder is common
to all who are zealous and active in that part of the enterpri&s;e,
though it &s;hould not appear that they are the very per&s;ons
who wounded or applied the fire: for they are all mutually,
and not remotely a&s;&s;i&s;tant, in the direct &s;teps and preparations
thereto, and cannot therefore be held to be without con|cern
in the event. In the ca&s;e, for in&s;tance, of the Porteous
mob, the guilt of the murder was not peculiar to him who
fixed the rope about the neck of the unfortunate victim on
that occa&s;ion, or otherwi&s;e laid hand upon him at the time of
his execution: It was equally the crime of all who were active
<PB N="245" REF="246">
in breaking up the door of the gaol, or who attended the
decea&s;ed in arms to the place of his death, or who took
any other the like forward part in ha&s;tening his de&s;truction.
Nay, if it had even been proved with re&s;pect to any indivi|dual,
that the quitted the a&s;&s;embly after a&s;&s;i&s;ting to break up
the door of the gaol and pull forth the decea&s;ed; &s;till the
&s;ame judgment would have been due to him; &s;ince whe|ther
he retired out of policy, or fear, or even out of repen|tance,
it was to no purpo&s;e, after &s;o materially promoting a
cata&s;trophe, which he from fir&s;t knew to be re&s;olved on,
and to be then no longer po&s;&s;ible to be prevented.</P>
<P>THE terms in which I have delivered their rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if Some|thing be done remote from the Purpo&s;e of the Mob.</NOTE> imply the
exception of tho&s;e ca&s;es, where &s;omething is done by a part
of the a&s;&s;embly, and without the a&s;&s;ent or perhaps the know|ledged
of the others, which is quite away from the &s;cope, or
out of the bounds of the original de&s;ign. Thus if a mob re|pair
to the &s;torehou&s;e of a dealer in grain, with intent to
cau&s;e him fell to them at their own price; and if, while this
is doing, &s;ome of the party &s;ecretly enter on another &s;ide
and &s;et fire to the hou&s;e; this &s;eems to be the peculiar guilt
of the&s;e who apply the fire: becau&s;e it is not done in pro&s;e|cution
of the original and common enterpri&s;e; though this
facilitates and gives occa&s;ion to the other.</P>
<P>II. To proceed to the puni&s;hment of mobbing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Law for Mobbing.&mdash;Roman Law.</NOTE> This we
&s;hall fir&s;t examine, as it &s;tands at common law; and next we
&s;hall inquire into the &s;upplemental provi&s;ions which have
been made by &s;tatute. Re&s;orting to the Roman law as an
authority in that matter, we find that this delict, which
fell under the &s;anction of the <HI>Lex Julia de vi Publica,</HI> was
variou&s;ly puni&s;hed, according to the degree of the violence,
<PB N="246" REF="247">
and the rank of the offender; with deportation in ordinary
ca&s;es, but &s;ometimes with death, e&s;pecially in offenders of
low degree. This &s;everity was in particular u&s;ed with re|&s;pect
to tho&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, who broke into or rifled a
dwelling-hou&s;e, <HI>&s;i quidem in turba cum telo fecerint;</HI> but un|der&s;tanding
by arms in this ca&s;e, all offen&s;ive weapons,

cour&s;e of puni&s;hment for tho&s;e more atrocious di&s;orders, &s;eems
worthy to be approved of, as a very &s;alutary part of the
Roman practice. For if we con&s;ider the danger with re&s;pect
to the public; what &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as a &s;trong curb to tho&s;e
&s;udden and outrageous effu&s;ions of rage, to which the giddy
multitude are &s;o liable; and which are &s;o much more ter|rible
in their con&s;equences, as well as &s;o much more conta|gious
in the example, than the crimes of &s;ingle per&s;ons?
And with re&s;pect al&s;o to the individual; whether it be that
his hou&s;e is burned, or his effects plundered and de&s;troyed, or
his per&s;on a&s;&s;aulted and wounded in his dwelling; &s;urely his
&s;ufferings are not the le&s;s on &s;uch occa&s;ions, (or rather they
are in &s;ome re&s;pects much higher), that the&s;e things are not
done by an individual, (in whom any of them would be a
capital offence), but by a whole ho&s;t of foes, of whom he
cannot know how far their wantonne&s;s and cruelty will
carry them.</P>
<P>So it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puni&s;hment of Mobbing at Common Law.</NOTE> however, that our common law does not &s;eem to
have taken this view of the &s;ubject; but rather to have at|tended
to tho&s;e humane con&s;iderations, which may be urged
for the offender in alleviation of his guilt; to the indi&s;cre|tion
of youth, the ignorance of the low and uneducated, the
pre&s;&s;ure of want on &s;ome occa&s;ions, the &s;eduction of example,
<PB N="247" REF="248">
and the temptation of pre&s;ent opportunity: cau&s;es, it is &s;up|po&s;ed,
which may &s;ometimes en&s;nare &s;uch per&s;ons who are
not habitually profligate, nor in the cour&s;e of forming &s;epa|rate
projects of violence or plunder for them&s;elves. On the&s;e,
or &s;ome &s;uch views, it probably is, that our cu&s;tom interpo&s;es
to &s;ave the life of the rioter, how great &s;oever the exce&s;&s;es
again&s;t property or per&s;on which have been committed;
if the libel is laid at common law, for the crime of mobbing
or convocation of the lieges, and not for any higher or more
&s;pecial denomination of crime. This lenient con&s;truction
was in particular followed in that numerous &s;et of trials
which took place in the months of May, June and July
1720, for the exten&s;ive commotions occa&s;ioned at that pe|riod,
by the high prices of grain. Very great exce&s;&s;es, of
different kinds, were charged in the indictments: The tu|multuous

of the bottoms, and cutting of the tackle and rigging of

<P>THUS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Fire|rai&s;ing by a Rio|ter; if Capital.</NOTE> upon the whole, there &s;eems to be no authority

capital crime, in the practice of Scotland. But from this it does
not follow, nor am I &s;ure that it is law, that from the &s;ame facts,
materials may not &s;ometimes be extracted for a relevant and
capital charge of &s;touthrief, hou&s;e-breaking, theft, or fire-rai&s;ing,
again&s;t an individual, upon the &s;pecial narrative of his
particular deed. If the libel bear the crime of murder as
well as riot in the major propo&s;ition, and if the minor charge
the pannel; that having gone with a mob to the hou&s;e of
James, to deface and pillage it, and James having &s;tood on
his defence, he the pannel, with a pi&s;tol, fired at and killed
him; certainly this is as relevant a charge of murder, as if
the pannel had lain in wait for James, or had entered the
hou&s;e, alone, with intent to kill him. The ca&s;e of Mac|lauchlane,
one of the Porteous mob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 93.</NOTE> in 1737, is here in
point: for he was charged with wilful murder, as well as
riot and other crimes; and the libel was found relevant ge|nerally
to infer the pains of law. There is al&s;o a precedent
with re&s;pect to the crime of fire-rai&s;ing committed by a
mob.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 13. 1784.</NOTE> I allude to the trial of William Spence, who was
charged with the fire-rai&s;ing as well as mobbing<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Major.</HI> &startq;As al&s;o, wilful fire-rai&s;ing, and con&s;uming by fire, any &s;uch hou&s;es, buildings, &amp;c. are crimes of an heinous nature, and &s;everely puni&s;h|able.&endq;</P>

&s;everal of the buildings were con&s;umed and de&s;troyed.
<PB N="251" REF="252">
This charge was accordingly &s;u&s;tained to infer the proper
pains of that atrocious crime; for in this &s;en&s;e the Court ex|plained
to the jury the general terms of their interlocutor,
which found the libel relevant to infer <HI>the pains of law.</HI> The
fact was fully proved, as related in the libel; but the pan|nel
had the good fortune, neverthele&s;s, to have a verdict re|turned
in his favour.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charge of Hou&s;e-breaking again&s;t a Rioter; if Competent.</NOTE> according to the analogy of the&s;e ca&s;es, there &s;eems
to be the &s;ame rea&s;on for &s;u&s;taining the charge of &s;touth|rief
or hou&s;e-breaking, with re&s;pect to any individual in the
mob, again&s;t whom a &s;et of facts, &s;ufficiently &s;pecial, can be
e&s;tabli&s;hed. As if it be proved, that the pannel forced open
a window, beat a cabinet in pieces, and carried off the valu|able
contents; which are afterwards found &s;ecreted in his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or di&s;po&s;ed of by him, for money, to others. Such
a charge &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s the full di&s;tinctive qualifications
of &s;touthrief. The &s;poil is not de&s;troyed out of malice, but
is taken away for lucre; and it is taken by proceedings of
the &s;ame kind, (only &s;till more violent), as in any other ca&s;e
of &s;touthrief. This material di&s;tinction, however, there is
between &s;uch a charge, and the charge of the like facts as
an act of riot, that they will not be &s;ubject to the &s;ame con|&s;truction
as to the matter of art and part. Under an indict|ment
for mobbing, the bare pre&s;ence and a&s;&s;ent of the pan|nel
at the time when the hou&s;e is entered and riffled, is a
lawful ground on which to find him guilty of the charge;
becau&s;e in this way he becomes a member of that tumultu|ous
meeting in which tho&s;e outrages are openly done; which
is the complex and general accu&s;ation again&s;t him and them.
But if the trial is to be for hou&s;e-breaking, or &s;touthrief, the
pannel's &s;pecial concern in the &s;eizure or removal of the par|ticular
<PB N="252" REF="253">
thing mu&s;t be brought home to him, to ju&s;tify his
conviction in that &s;ort; and the libel mu&s;t charge him with
the fact, in the &s;ame articulate fa&s;hion as in any ordinary
ca&s;e. The difficulty of procuring the nece&s;&s;ary evidence to
this effect, is probably the rea&s;on why &s;uch atrocious injuries
have ordinarily been tried under the name of mobbing only.</P>
<P>WE have,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rioter libelled for Hou&s;e-break|ing.</NOTE> however, three in&s;tances at lea&s;t of a charge of
theft and hou&s;e-breaking &s;u&s;tained upon &s;uch grounds;
though in none of them pro&s;ecuted to a capital i&s;&s;ue. On
the 18th June 1716, Allan Guthrie is indicted for theft
and hou&s;e-breaking<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Major.</HI> &startq;That contrary to the laws of this and all other well governed nations, whereby <HI>the crime of theft and hou&s;e-breaking,</HI> odious in them&s;elves, are puni&s;hable with the pains of death, and confi&s;cation of moveables, he the &s;aid Allan Guthrie did commit the &s;aid crimes; in &s;o far as,&endq; &amp;c.</NOTE>; in as much as he forced entry of
the Cu&s;tomhou&s;e at Leith; broke up a che&s;t therein, and
&s;tole out of it a bag of foreign gold. The pannel an&s;wers,
that it is notorious that the hou&s;e was pillaged by an arm|ed
ho&s;t of Highlanders, in open day; whom if the pannel
joined, he might be guilty of &s;puilzie, or riot, or perhaps
of trea&s;on, but in nowi&s;e of theft; which is a clande&s;tine
crime, that is done for the &s;ake of lucre, and not as here,
<HI>animo ul&s;ci&s;cendi.</HI> And he concludes with pleading, that &s;ince
the charge is made under no other name but that of theft,
he may be a&s;&s;oilzied in this proce&s;s, leaving it to the pro|&s;ecutor
to indict him for a riot, as accords. The pro&s;ecutor,
without much di&s;puting that the mode and occa&s;ion of the
hou&s;e-breaking were &s;uch as alleged by the pannel, re&s;tricts
his libel to an arbitrary puni&s;hment; and contends, that the
crime is not the le&s;s a theft on account of tho&s;e accom|panyments
<PB N="253" REF="254">
of numbers and open violence; and that as &s;uch
it may competently be tried, although it might al&s;o have
been libelled under other appellations. Upon this debate, the
Court repel the defences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 2. 1716.</NOTE> and find it relevant again&s;t the
pannel, &startq;his having at the time libelled, in company with
others, broke open a wooden box or che&s;t in the &s;aid Cu&s;|tomhou&s;e,
and taking out thereof all or any of the pieces

Campbell; on which account it was contended, but without
&s;ucce&s;s, that Hamilton was puni&s;hable with death as a rob|ber.
But no mention had been made of this matter in the

near communication. Our Legi&s;lature, accordingly, are
&s;aid to have attended to the peculiar exigencies of this &s;itua|tion,

Now this is a peculiar, and not very preci&s;e phra&s;e; but
which, as far as I can judge, was at one period held to be
<PB N="257" REF="258">
applicable to any tumult that was in hinderance of the cour&s;e
of public ju&s;tice, or of lawful and e&s;tabli&s;hed authority; For

is done that is unlawful, (which is true of every &s;ort
of violence), but &s;omething is hindered, which the law has
commanded to be done, and has made co&s;tly e&s;tabli&s;hments
to enforce. Certain it is, that on the 8th of February 1686,
David Moubray had &s;entence of death; being convicted,
by his own confe&s;&s;ion, of art and part in a tumult, which
re&s;cued a criminal from the officers of ju&s;tice in the execu|tion
of a &s;entence of whipping. And, on the 26th of the &s;ame

mentioned, for a more remote concern in the &s;ame commotion.</P>
<P>BESIDE the foregoing &s;tatute, there is another, which
al&s;o was the ground, in former times, of more than one pro|&s;ecution
for the highe&s;t pains. I allude to the act pa&s;&s;ed in.
the reign of Queen Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1563, c. 83.</NOTE> and entitled, &startq;<HI>Ament the &s;tancheing

<P>UPON this law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions on the&s;e &s;tatutes. Nov. 26. 1664.</NOTE> along with the others, indictment was rai&s;ed
again&s;t John Strachan, for convocating an armed mob in the
city of Edinburgh, who marched to the hou&s;e of Sir Wil|liam
Seton, farmer of the cu&s;toms, which they broke into
and riffled; as well as they re&s;i&s;ted a party of &s;oldiers that
was &s;ent to quell them. The libel concluded for the pains
of death and confi&s;cation of moveables; and the Lord Advo|cate
in&s;i&s;ted to the &s;ame effect in the debate upon the charge,
&startq;The Ju&s;tice-depute &s;u&s;tains the libel as it is libelled and
declared by my Lord Advocate, and ordains the &s;ame to
pa&s;s to the knowledge of an a&s;&s;ize; and declares that he
&s;u&s;tains the pre&s;ence with the being in arms, and deeds of
acce&s;&s;ion libelled.&endq; An irregularity in the proceedings
prevented this ca&s;e from coming to an i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>THE next example is the trial of Alexander Clunie and
others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 6. 1682.</NOTE> where the charge was of a convocation in Edinburgh,
who forced the drummers of the King's militia to beat for
them, compelled the enlargement of pri&s;oners from the Ca|nongate
gaol, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the keys of the city gates,
and in&s;ulted certain Privy Coun&s;ellors who interpo&s;ed to &s;tay
the tumult. It does not appear, that the multitude in this ca&s;e,
nor any part of them, were provided with warlike weapons.
But the pro&s;ecutor, availing him&s;elf of the circum&s;tance of
the alarm having been given to the mob by beat of drum, or
<HI>talbrone,</HI> &s;trenuou&s;ly contended, that the &s;everal qualities men|tioned
in the act of Mary, (for the libel was mainly laid up|on
that law), were not to be taken jointly, but &s;eparately;
&s;o that death might be inflicted for any tumult, where any
<PB N="259" REF="260">
one of tho&s;e qualities occurred. To this (as I mu&s;t think it)
unrea&s;onable con&s;truction, (for the &s;tatute was plainly made
for repre&s;&s;ing a&s;&s;emblies <HI>in arms</HI>), the Judges of that time gave
their a&s;&s;ent; and delivered their interlocutor thus: &startq;Finds
the convocation libelled, as it is circum&s;tantiate and qua|lified,
relevant, any one of the circum&s;tances being pro|ven,
to infer a capital puni&s;hment; and that the pannels
being pre&s;ent, and did a&s;&s;i&s;t or concur, by deeds or words,
in the &s;aid tumult, although without arms, is relevant to
infer art and part thereof again&s;t them.&endq; The a&s;&s;ize
found it proved, &startq;That Alexander Clunie was pre&s;ent and
apprehendit in the &s;tair of Sir George Kinnaird his cham|ber,
at the tyme when a part of that &s;editious and tumul|tuous
rabble did invade the&s;e Lords of his Maje&s;ty's Privy
Council conde&s;cendit on in the indictment, but his con|curring
or a&s;&s;i&s;ting by deeds or words not proven.&endq; I
conjecture that this verdict had not been to the &s;atisfaction of
the Court; for the following addition is &s;ubjoined to it in
the record. &startq;The a&s;&s;ize having <HI>again</HI> con&s;idered the with|in

they find nothing proven but naked pre&s;ence at the
inva&s;ion.&endq; After all, Clunie was remanded to pri&s;on,
until farther order with re&s;pect to him; and how he was in
the end di&s;po&s;ed of, the record does not inform me.</P>
<P>ANOTHER precedent upon the matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions on the&s;e Statutes.</NOTE> but by no means
liable to the like &s;trong objections as the la&s;t, occurred a
few years after;<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 2. 1691.</NOTE> the ca&s;e of Captain James Bruce, who was
pro&s;ecuted upon this and the other &s;tatutes above mentioned,
for ordering a convocation of &s;oldiers in arms within the city
of Edinburgh, and a&s;&s;aulting the city guard; in which tu|mult
&s;everal &s;oldiers of the guard were killed. The Court
<PB N="260" REF="261">
found the libel relevant to infer the pain of death<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Finds that part of the libel anent the pannel's giving command to drum|mers to beat an alarum in the Canongate, for gathering of &s;ouldiers to their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and the &s;ouldiers gathering thereon, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the Netherbow Port, and &s;eizing upon &s;ome of the town's Captains, and making them pri&s;oners, relevant to infer the pain of death libelled again&s;t the giver of the &s;aid command.&endq;</NOTE>. He
was acquitted of the command to convocate, but was con|victed
as art and part of the &s;laughter, and had &s;entence ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>IT appears that &s;hortly after this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con&s;truction of the&s;e Laws altered.</NOTE> doubts had come
to be entertained re&s;pecting the true object or the&s;e &s;ta|tutes;
whether they did not relate only to regular leagues
and bonds, or confederacies to rai&s;e and maintain men in
arms again&s;t the Government, on pretence of public grievan|ces,
and had been &s;trained in being applied to occa&s;ional
tumults on account of local incidents, or for private cau&s;es.
What was, perhaps, of at lea&s;t equal weight; there concur|red
with the&s;e grounds a general di&s;like of the &s;tatutes
them&s;elves, on account of the oppre&s;&s;ive u&s;e which had been
made of them in &s;ome of the foregoing ca&s;es. So it is, that
in the next trial after that of Captain Bruce, we find the be|ginning
of a milder interpretation of this part of the law;
which not only has not been departed from in later times,
but has gradually been extended, to the entire abandonment,
in the end, of the benefit of the capital &s;anction.</P>
<P>I NOW allude to the trial of Charles Weir and others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;truction of the&s;e Laws alter|ed.</NOTE>
which was for a great tumult in the city of Edinburgh, by
per&s;ons armed with &s;words and other mortal weapons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 22. 1700.</NOTE> who
invaded the city gaol, forced entry thereof by fire, &s;et free
<PB N="261" REF="262">
&s;everal pri&s;oners for crimes, and deforced the Magi&s;trates in
their exertions to quell them. It was thus both an armed
a&s;&s;embly within burgh, in which the bare act of pre&s;ence in
arms was capital, according to the &s;tatute of Mary, as ex|plained
in the ca&s;e of Strachan; and it was al&s;o an a&s;&s;em|bly
in hinderance of the common law, wherein it was ca|pital
to a&s;&s;i&s;t or concur, according to the cu&s;tomary con|&s;truction
of the act of James II. But the interlocutor found
the libel relevant to infer death again&s;t tho&s;e pannels only,
who had lent a &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance with hammers or with war|like
weapons, in the burning or breaking up of the pri&s;on
doors or fa&s;tenings, or in the inva&s;ion of the town's guard.
Tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the fore&s;aid acts with rung or ba|ton,
or who had even a&s;&s;i&s;ted with warlike weapons, if it
was only in the convocation at large, and not in the effrac|tion
of the gaol, were found only liable to an arbitrary pu|ni&s;hment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">July 29. 1700. &startq;Find that part of the libel, of having a drawn &s;word or biggonet, or other bellical in&s;trument, or forehammers, and thereby a&s;&s;i&s;ting by pre&s;ence, at the burning of the tolbooth-door, for effraction thereof, or by &s;et|ting of fire to the &s;aid gate, or feeding of the fire when &s;ett to, or by entering the pri&s;on thereafter, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the breaking up of the cheeklock, or in|vading of the town-guards, relevant, <HI>&s;eparatim,</HI> to infer the pains of death li|belled; and find, the acting and a&s;&s;i&s;ting with drawn &s;word, biggonet or dag|ger, in the convocation, relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment; and finds, the a&s;&s;i&s;ting with a rung or baton, at the burning or breaking up of the tol|booth-door, or cheeklock, or at the invading of the guard, al&s;o relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment.&endq;</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="262" REF="263">
THE next remarkable &s;et of trials for mobbing, were tho&s;e
in 1720; at which time a number of pro&s;ecutions took place
on account of the many tumults in Fife, and &s;ome of the
neighbouring counties, occa&s;ioned by the high prices of
grain. Violent as the di&s;orders on that occa&s;ion were, it
might however be que&s;tioned, how far any of them fell un|der
either of the &s;tatutes above mentioned, even, according
to the &s;en&s;e, which in &s;ome former ca&s;es had been put upon
them. It is certain, that the act of Mary was not libelled
in any one in&s;tance; and as far as laid upon the other Scots
&s;tatutes, or at common law, the charge was invariably found
relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment only.</P>
<P>BUT on the next occa&s;ion after the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con&s;truction of the&s;e Laws al|tered.</NOTE> that of the great
tumult in Gla&s;gow, already &s;o often mentioned, there was a
more favourable opportunity than had yet happened, of try|ing
how far the&s;e ordinances were &s;till in force, and to what
objects they properly applied. For this was a ca&s;e of very great
and formidable convocation within burgh, called by beat of
drum, and con&s;i&s;ting of per&s;ons equipped with fire-arms
and other warlike weapons; and who after a&s;&s;embling for
that preci&s;e purpo&s;e, invaded and drove out of the burgh a
party of his Maje&s;ty's forces; and of which party they
made two &s;oldiers pri&s;oners, whom they abu&s;ed to the danger
of their lives; be&s;ide endeavouring to hinder the reception of
the party into a neighbouring burgh, whither for &s;afety they
retired. The acts of James and Mary, as well as others, were
therefore libelled; and the whole circle of argument relative
to this matter was anxioui&s;ly debated. The re&s;ult was a judg|ment,
finding that the&s;e high charges, equally as that of pil|laging
the hou&s;e of an individual, were only relevant to in|fer

with an armed force his Maje&s;ty's troops, relevant to in|fer
an arbitrary puni&s;hment <HI>only,</HI> are both of them in my
humble opinion contrary to law.&endq; Since that time, the
&s;ame que&s;tion has not again been moved. In all later ca&s;es,
either the&s;e &s;tatutes have not been libelled at all; or they

is in the&s;e words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clau&s;e again&s;t the demoli&s;hing of Buildings.</NOTE> &startq;That if any per&s;ons unlawfully, rio|tou&s;ly

<P>OUR fir&s;t trial upon this part of the act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;truction of that clau&s;e.</NOTE> was that of the

<P>THE only way of de&s;troying a hou&s;e that comes under
the expre&s;&s;ions of the act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;truction of that clau&s;e.</NOTE> is by tearing it to pieces, and not
by burning, blowing up, nor otherwi&s;e; as indeed it was the
pulling down of the di&s;&s;enting meeting-hou&s;es, that princi|pally
gave occa&s;ion to the pa&s;&s;ing of this law. But although
the&s;e were the immediate objects of protection at the time;
all dwelling-hou&s;es, barns, &s;tables, or other out-hou&s;es, are
however under the &s;ame &s;afeguard, by the expre&s;s words
of the act. It is al&s;o to be remembered with re&s;pect to
this clau&s;e of the &s;tatute, that it creates a capital offence,
which is quite independent of the proclamation to di&s;per&s;e;
and of any of the &s;everal circum&s;tances of guilt and con|tempt,
which are required under the other and leading ar|ticle

additions, of what had formerly been enacted, for a time,

this was made felony, but within the benefit of

of the 18th July 1720. The libel in that ca&s;e had charged the
proclamation to have been made by a Ju&s;tice of Peace, or
a Magi&s;trate of the burgh, &startq;or by one or other of the con|&s;tables
or other peace-officers of the &s;aid county or burgh,
having power to make &s;uch requi&s;ition.&endq; But in&s;tead of
adopting the &s;everal parts of this alternative, the interlo|cutor
&s;tudiou&s;ly avoids it, and employs a general phra&s;e,
&startq;and being required by a Ju&s;tice of Peace, Magi&s;trate, or
others empowered to that effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25. 1720.</NOTE> by act of Parliament 1&s;t
of George I.&endq; which leaves the matter at large.</P>
<P>To authori&s;e the making of proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tumult, without &s;elonious Act, is Ground of Pro|clamation.</NOTE> it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary

riotou&s;ly, and tumultuou&s;ly a&s;&s;embled; that is to &s;ay, with
&s;uch circum&s;tances of force, agitation, and di&s;order, as are
alarming to the lieges, and amount to a di&s;turbance of the pub|lic

the other &s;ide it is equally certain, that if the rioters pro|ceed
to any inva&s;ion of property or per&s;on; then, without re|gard
to the expiration of an hour, or any other &s;pace of time,
and though no proclamation have been made, the offenders
therein are not only liable to be puni&s;hed for tho&s;e violences
upon trial, but al&s;o to be forcibly re&s;i&s;ted, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and
taken on the &s;pot, either by the Magi&s;trate or by the indivi|duals

tenor and permi&s;&s;ion of the common law for &s;uch ca&s;es; to
which ca&s;es this enactment relateth not. The law was in
particular explained in this manner by Lord Chief Ju&s;tice
Loughborough, on occa&s;ion of the trials for the great riots
in the metropolis, in 1780.</P>
<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t the Pannel be proved to have been pre|&s;ent at the Pro|clamation.</NOTE> in order to convict any one of this new and in&s;ti|tuted

proved to have been pre&s;ent at the time of making the pro|clamation?
No ca&s;e has yet happened to require a deci|&s;ion
of this point; but the leading con&s;ideration with re|&s;pect
to it &s;eems to be this, that the felony created by the
&s;tatute lies in the rebellious and ob&s;tinate purpo&s;e of the
meeting,&mdash;their wilful and deliberate contempt of the law|ful
warning to di&s;per&s;e. Now, though in mo&s;t other ca&s;es
of criminal proceeding, the ouvert act which is going on,
carries full information with it to all who are pre&s;ent,
of the nature, extent, and con&s;equences of the guilt; it is
quite otherwi&s;e in this in&s;tance, where, though the crime
be only then capital when proclamation has been made
and the hour has expired, yet the a&s;pect of the a&s;&s;embly is
the &s;ame to any one who joins it, whether the&s;e aggravating
circum&s;tances exi&s;t or not. It cannot therefore ju&s;tly be pre|&s;umed
again&s;t any one, who is not &s;hown to have been pre&s;ent
when the proclamation was made, that he is in the know|ledge
of that monition; and thus, though he be one of a
meeting, which, taken complexly, is involved in the guilt
of a capital felony, yet he may not be per&s;onally art
and part thereof; becau&s;e not participant of that mutinous
<PB N="269" REF="270">
re&s;olution, wherein lies their guilt, and the one rea&s;on and
ju&s;ti&s;ication of the enactment.</P>
<P>THIS favourable con&s;truction to the pannel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if he be duly warned that it was made.</NOTE> cannot, how|ever,
be rea&s;onably carried any greater length. Though he
was not pre&s;ent at the time of proclamation; yet if on join|ing
the a&s;&s;embly he is duly informed of that matter; as for
in&s;tance if he in&s;ult a Magi&s;trate or con&s;table, and is then
told that half an hour before proclamation was made in
terms of the act; certainly, in failing to depart upon this
warning, he becomes a member of the felonious a&s;&s;embly;
and a&s;&s;ociates him&s;elf, not to their company only, but to
their progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of guilt and danger, as at the time of
his joining them, and is thence forward in the &s;ame ca&s;e with
tho&s;e who have all along been in the meeting: &s;o that by
continuing with them for half an hour more, he is equal|ly
guilty as they of the capital offence. If he only join the

of the &s;ituation of things; in this ca&s;e too he is involved
in the &s;ame guilt, if he &s;hall not depart forthwith.</P>

this &s;hall be quite the &s;ame as if they were proved, (which
is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible), to have continued in it con&s;tantly. As
al&s;o, it is indi&s;putable in regard to tho&s;e who have recently
joined the multitude, and whether they be in the knowledge
of the proclamation or not, that they mu&s;t run the ri&s;k of
any force which the Magi&s;trate &s;hall employ to &s;uppre&s;s the

tumult. For, be&s;ide this good rea&s;on, that it is impo&s;&s;ible
for the Magi&s;trate to di&s;tingui&s;h the ca&s;e of individuals on
&s;uch an occa&s;ion, truly the man &s;u&s;&s;ers no &s;ort of hard|&s;hip
in this con&s;truction; knowing, as he ought to do, that
the Magi&s;trate may lawfully make u&s;e of all means for di&s;|per&s;ing

with re&s;pect to the killing of the rioters, for barely conti|nuing

are agreed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, Vol. i. p. 53. 293. 495.; Hawkins, vol. i. p. 158. 159. No. 11.: Fo&s;ter, p. 270. No. 2.; Black&s;tone, b. 4. c. 11.</NOTE>), than a declaration of the power which the
common law attributes to every Magi&s;trate for the pre&s;erva|tion
of the peace, and which, if it had not been be&s;towed
in this &s;tatute, could not have been under&s;tood to be with|held.
In virtue of his office, the Magi&s;trate has always
had right to command the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all the lieges, who
are of age and ability, to &s;uppre&s;s and &s;ecure the offen|ders
in any tumult; wherein, if they oppo&s;e him, and will
not de&s;i&s;t, nor &s;uffer them&s;elves to be taken, it has al|ways
been at their own peril, and not imputable to the
Magi&s;trate; provided he be temperate in his proceedings,
and u&s;e his privilege with due humanity and di&s;cretion. In
this point, the &s;tatute has in truth made no addition to
the law; farther than as by aggravating the character of the
tumult into a capital felony, it has made the call the &s;trong|er
upon the Magi&s;trate to &s;uppre&s;s it, and has pointed out a
certain &s;ea&s;on in the progre&s;s of the di&s;order, as peculiarly
proper for his exertions to that end. In like manner, as al|ready
hinted, if the a&s;&s;embly are not only tumultuous, but
proceed to violence again&s;t property or per&s;on; in this &s;i|tuation
al&s;o, without any regard to the hour, whether it has
expired or not, or even to the circum&s;tance of proclama|tion
having been made; the force may in&s;tantly be repel|led
<PB N="273" REF="274">
with force, on the part either of the individual for him|&s;elf,
or of the Magi&s;trate in aid of him; who has not only
power, but is in duty bound, to levy a &s;ufficient <HI>po&s;&s;e</HI> for his
defence. For, though &s;uch a notion may have gone abroad
among the ignorant, it is not to be imagined, that the ope|ration
of this &s;tatute, intended as it was in &s;upplement to
the common law, can be to di&s;arm in effect and unnerve the
Magi&s;trate, during a &s;pace of time which is &s;ufficient for the
perpetration of the mo&s;t outrageous exce&s;&s;es.</P>

a length, as to di&s;turb and alarm the neighbourhood, this
&s;eems to be cogni&s;able at in&s;tance of the public pro&s;ecutor,
as a breach of the public peace; to the effect at lea&s;t of in|flicting
fine and impri&s;onment, and exacting caution from
the offenders, for their good behaviour for &s;ome time to
come.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="276">
II. I had occa&s;ion to mention formerly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THREATENING LETTER.</NOTE> by connection
with the crime of fire-rai&s;ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sending of In|cendiary Letter puni&s;hable.</NOTE> that the law takes cogni&s;ance
not only of an attempt, but even of a threatening to rai&s;e
&s;ire, and though made in form of words only; which may
be the mere pa&s;&s;ionate effu&s;ion of ill-temper at the moment.
Much more, therefore, will it pay regard to denunciations
of this or any other the like atrocious mi&s;chief, when reduced
to the more &s;erious and deliberate form of writing, or incen|diary
letter (as it is often called), addre&s;&s;ed and conveyed to
the per&s;on who is the object of this malicious contrivance.
Even in the ca&s;e, which is the lea&s;t formidable, of &s;uch a
letter being &s;igned with the real name of the writer, our
Judges have thought &s;uch an attempt not unde&s;erving of
the puni&s;hment of tran&s;portation; as tending to deprive the
per&s;on to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed of that peace of mind, and
opinion of &s;ecurity, which are among the chief benefits of
the &s;tate of civil union. John Fra&s;er was tried upon a
charge of this kind, in March 1759. He had, at different
periods, written letters to John Shand, his brother-in-law,
all of them in his ordinary hand, and &s;igned with his own
name, and threatening Shand with all &s;orts of mi&s;chief, if
his demands of money were not complied with; in which
cour&s;e being &s;ucce&s;sful for a time, he was encouraged to
make farther requi&s;itions. He was found guilty, and was
adjudged to be tran&s;ported for &s;even years.</P>
<P>ANOTHER mode of the &s;ame offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extorting of Money by In|cendiary Letter, is not Robbery.</NOTE> and more likely to
be re&s;orted to by ill-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, both as &s;afer for
them&s;elves, and more effectual for their purpo&s;e, whether
this be to indulge malice, or to profit the offender, is
the &s;ending of anonymous letters, or letters &s;igned with
fictitious names, and threatening harm to per&s;on or pro|perty,
<PB N="276" REF="277">
by fire or other violence, unle&s;s &s;omething &s;hall be
done, or &s;hall be de&s;i&s;ted from, which is mentioned in the
letter. Even in the ca&s;e of this practice having had com|plete
&s;ucce&s;s in the eliciting of money, it cannot indeed
be con&s;trued into a robbery or capital offence. On the one
part, the contriver of this device does not &s;how the &s;ame
hardy and re&s;olute wickedne&s;s as the robber: On the con|trary,
he, in the whole &s;cheme, &s;hows a fear of any per|&s;onal
rencounter, and purpo&s;ely avoids to put the object of
his attempt in that in&s;tant hazard of death or bodily harm,
or to bring things to that dangerous i&s;&s;ue of a per&s;onal
&s;truggle, which are the ju&s;t rea&s;ons for puni&s;hing robbery
with death. On the other part, the &s;ufferer is him&s;elf in
&s;ome mea&s;ure acce&s;&s;ory to the completion of the crime
again&s;t him; being worked upon to yield up his money
through a vague apprehen&s;ion of mi&s;chief, which though
natural, and in &s;ome in&s;tances excu&s;able, is however exce&s;|&s;ive,
and is indeed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a breach of that due re|gard
which he owes to the public. For, in&s;tead of recur|ring
to the Magi&s;trate, and to his neighbour for protection,
&s;uch a per&s;on deliberately chu&s;es to abandon that &s;ocial
&s;afeguard; and &s;ubmits him&s;elf to the dominion of a ru&s;&s;ian,
who thus intermeddles with his property, in &s;ome mea&s;ure
with his own con&s;ent, and upon a &s;ort of contract of ran&s;om
between them upon the matter.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes again&s;t &s;ending threaten|ing Letters.</NOTE> though it cannot be reduced under the de|&s;cription
of robbery, it is a wicked attempt again&s;t the peace
of the individual; who is kept in dread of &s;ome great
evil, which he cannot fully guard again&s;t, from an un|certain
hand. It is al&s;o a practice of the mo&s;t dangerous
example, as tending to lay the orderly and indu&s;trious part
<PB N="277" REF="278">
of the community, and e&s;pecially its Magi&s;trates and pub|lic
officers, under contribution to the licentious and pro&s;li|gate.
In certain parts of the neighbouring kingdom, prac|tices
of this kind had, at one time, arrived at &s;uch a pitch of
frequency, as to require the &s;pecial interpo&s;ition of the Legi&s;|lature,
in aid of their common law. The act of the 9th
George I. c. 22. proceeds upon the narrative, that ill-de|&s;igning
per&s;ons had of late a&s;&s;ociated under the name of
<HI>Blacks,</HI> who went about armed, and with their faces blacked,
and doing all manner of mi&s;chief; and who were in u&s;e to
&s;end letters under fictitious names, making demand of veni|&s;on,
money, and other things, and threatening great vio|lence
if &s;uch their orders &s;hould not be complied with,
or if they &s;hould be hindered or mole&s;ted in their law|le&s;s
proceedings. Wherefore it enacts, that whoever &startq;&s;hall
knowingly &s;end any letter without any name &s;ub&s;cribed
thereto, or &s;igned with a fictitious name, demanding mo|ney,
veni&s;on, or other valuable thing,&endq; &s;hall be adjud|ged
guilty of felony, and &s;uffer death without benefit of
clergy.</P>
<P>THE act of the 27th George II. c. 15.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes again&s;t &s;ending threaten|ing Letter.</NOTE> was meant as a &s;up|plement
to the former; and appointed the &s;ame pains for
any per&s;on who &s;hould &s;end a letter not &s;igned, or &s;igned
with a fictitious name, and threatening death or fire-rai&s;ing,
&startq;though no money, or veni&s;on, or other valuable thing be
demanded in or by &s;uch letter:&endq; Which &s;ort of addre&s;s
might indeed be thought to be the more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing of the
two, as leaving no way of compliance open, to avert the
threatened evil.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Do they extend to Scotland?</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT as the fir&s;t of the&s;e laws was made for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion
of local and temporary di&s;orders in a certain quarter of
<PB N="278" REF="279">
England; &s;o in the ca&s;e of James Gray, where this matter
underwent a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 27. and July 11. 1737.</NOTE> it was virtually found not to ex|tend
to this part of the united kingdoms; the libel being
only &s;u&s;tained to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment. Though
the &s;ame judgment has not yet been given, it may probably
be expected with re&s;pect al&s;o to the latter &s;tatute, which has
reference to the fir&s;t, and is calculated (as the title bears)
to explain and amend it. The charge was in part laid
on it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 29. 1781.</NOTE> in the ca&s;e of Thomas Gemmell; but it was judged
prudent in the end to abandon the &s;tatute, and re&s;trict the
conclu&s;ion to &s;uch an arbitrary puni&s;hment as might be ob|tained
at common law.</P>
<P>THE truth is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of this Crime at Com|mon Law.</NOTE> that we have little rea&s;on to regret the limi|tation
of the&s;e &s;tatutes to the other quarter of the kingdom;
becau&s;e our common law has native vigour &s;ufficent to pu|ni&s;h
this enormity in a manner which the common law of
England would not have authori&s;ed; and which is fully equal
to what the urgency of the evil in this country has at any
time required. As appears from the afore&s;aid ca&s;e of James
Gray, who, being convicted of writing anonymous letters to
&s;everal per&s;ons, threatening all &s;ort of violence, if a pur&s;e of
money were not laid for him in a certain place, was adjudged
to &s;tand in the pillory, and to be tran&s;ported for life. This,
and the ca&s;e of Fra&s;er already quoted, in which al&s;o the pannel
had &s;entences of tran&s;portation, are, as far as I have &s;een, the
only in&s;tances of judgment for this &s;ort of offence. But the
charge has been found relevant in &s;undry other ca&s;es.</P>
<P>IT was one accu&s;ation among others again&s;t William Gil|chri&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. 1741.</NOTE>
that he had written two letters to a certain dealer in
corn, threatening him with fire and violence, unle&s;s he
&s;hould bring forth his grain, and &s;ell it at a low rate; or if
<PB N="279" REF="280">
he &s;hould inquire about the per&s;ons who had broken into and
plundered his mill. And in that ca&s;e, the &startq;libel and &s;everal
articles thereof,&endq; were found relevant to infer the pains
of law.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 17. &amp; 18. 1761.</NOTE> In like manner, John Edwards was accu&s;ed of wri|ting
an anonymous letter to John&s;ton of Straiton, threaten|ing

certain &s;tone, at &s;uch a time when the writer might find it.
The libel was found relevant to infer the pains of law, and
the pro&s;ecutor re&s;tricted his conclu&s;ions to an arbitrary pu|ni&s;hment;
but the jury found a verdict for the pannel.
The like re&s;triction had been made, and the like verdict
was returned, in the ca&s;e already mentioned, of Thomas
Gemmell, who was charged as author of &s;undry anonymous
letters to a certain gentleman, threatening to kill him,
or to de&s;troy his property with fire. Much about the &s;ame
time, this gentleman had received another letter, of &s;imi|lar
contents, and concluding with this device, by way of
&s;ub&s;cription, <HI>A&s;k about is my name.</HI> William Rennie fell under

breach of the peace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DUEL, &amp;c.</NOTE> We have already &s;een, that where a
duel takes place upon a challenge, and is followed with the
death of one of the parties, this, according to the law of
Scotland, is murder in the &s;urviver, how fair and equal &s;oever
the manner of conducting the combat. But, the better to
repre&s;s &s;uch irregularities, to which the &s;ervent temper of
the Scots &s;o &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed them, the Legi&s;lature, by the
&s;tatute 1600, c. 12. rai&s;ed the bare act of engaging in a duel,
to the &s;ame rank of a capital crime as the actual &s;laughter;
without di&s;tingui&s;hing whether any of the parties did or did
not &s;uffer any wound or material harm on the occa&s;ion. To
complete the re&s;traint; it was, by &s;tatute 1696, c. 35. made
puni&s;hable with bani&s;hment and e&s;cheat of moveables, to be
concerned in the giving, &s;ending, or accepting of a chal|lenge;
even though no combat &s;hould en&s;ue.</P>
<P>THIS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is to be held a Chal|lenge.</NOTE> however, is a rigorous law, upon which indictment
will not lie, but in the ca&s;e of a direct and deliberate de|fiance
to fight; a propo&s;al to that effect, &s;eriou&s;ly and expli|citly
given, and if not attended with all the ob&s;ervances
that are often u&s;ed on &s;uch occa&s;ions, at lea&s;t definite and re|gular

(<HI>verba jactantia),</HI> uttered face to face, and only tending to a
challenge, but not the very propo&s;al and adju&s;tment of a

of the charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 5. &amp; 9. 1719.</NOTE> in the libel at in&s;tance of William Alves

In the
prior ca&s;e of James Maccall, merchant in Leith, indicted
at in&s;tance of Ba&s;&s;et Eids,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 5. 1714.</NOTE> land-&s;urveyor there, the Court
had, however, &s;u&s;tained a charge to this effect; that Maccall,
having thrown out a per&s;onal defiance to Eids to &s;ight, and
threatened to affront him wherever they &s;hould again meet,
he early next morning left a verbal me&s;&s;age for him with his
&s;ervant, at his hou&s;e in Leith, bearing that he &s;hould wait for
Eids upon the beach, and have &s;atisfaction from him for what
had pa&s;&s;ed the day before. The challenge had been much of
the &s;ame &s;ort, in another ca&s;e, and the only one, as far as I can
find, where a pro&s;ecution on the &s;tatute has been attended
with &s;ucce&s;s; the ca&s;e of David Cairns, (brother to the Laird
of Torr), tried at Dumfries before Lord Bowhill, on the 1&s;t
and 2d of May 1712. It appears from the proof, that the
defiance was given verbally, and by the one party in the
per&s;onal pre&s;ence of the other; but in direct and plain terms,
and with mention of time and place, though accompanied
with &s;oul and opprobrious epithets. The Judge found the

V. I SHALL conclude this Chapter with a few words as to
the bearing of mortal weapons upon the per&s;on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bearing of Fire-arms; Laws again&s;t it.</NOTE> a practice
which our Legi&s;lature have regarded as a preparation for vio|lence,
and the &s;ign of an evil and quarrel&s;ome di&s;po&s;ition. The
earlie&s;t re&s;traint of the freedom of the lieges in this particu|lar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1567, c. 18.</NOTE>
is by a &s;tatute of James VI. which was made on occa|&s;ion
of certain outrages committed in Edinburgh; and is ge|neral
with re&s;pect to the per&s;ons who are forbidden, but is
only directed again&s;t the u&s;ing or bearing of <HI>fire-arms,</HI> as
tho&s;e with which mi&s;chief may mo&s;t &s;uddenly be done,
and which chiefly exclude the common means of defence,
by &s;uperior courage or activity. By this law, the puni&s;h|ment
of u&s;ing or bearing fire-arms, is the lo&s;s of the right
hand;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1597, c. 252.</NOTE> to which an after law, &s;uperadds the e&s;cheat of move|ables.
Probably, the great &s;everity of the&s;e pains, and the
bent of the manners of the time, had proved an ob&s;tacle to
the execution of this mea&s;ure of police. At lea&s;t this may
be conjectured from the &s;tyle of the next law on the &s;ubject,
the act 1600, c. 6.; which complains, in the preamble, of
the difficulty of convicting offenders in the ordinary way of
trial, by an a&s;&s;ize, and upon the te&s;timony of witne&s;&s;es; and
therefore be&s;tows a juri&s;diction on the Privy Council in this
matter, with a power of trial by oath of party; but only to
the effect of in&s;licting a fine, or e&s;cheat of moveables, or ward|ing
of the per&s;on. According to Mackenzie, it authori&s;es
the Ju&s;tice Court al&s;o to proceed in the &s;ame form; but
as &s;uch a cour&s;e of trial is in derogation of the common
rule, &s;o this opinion &s;eems to be contrary to a ju&s;t con|&s;truction
of the &s;tatute.</P>
<P>IT does not appear that any of the&s;e laws was ever put to ve|ry
&s;trict or rigorous execution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of this Crime.</NOTE> In &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;uch as that
<PB N="285" REF="286">
of William Gray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">UNLAWFUL WEAPONS.</NOTE> the Court referred the puni&s;hment to the
deci&s;ion of King and Council. Very often the pannel came
in the King's will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. 1620.</NOTE> and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a &s;light cen&s;ure.
And &s;ometimes, for aught that appears, the conviction was
not followed with any &s;entence at all; as in the ca&s;e of Sir
Henry Lind&s;ay, in February 1603; and of William Max|well
of Cowhill, Augu&s;t 6. 1605. In &s;hort, no in&s;tance is
to be found of a per&s;on condemned to lo&s;e his hand for u&s;ing
or bearing fire-arms, unle&s;s that offence were coupled to an
act of &s;laughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 2. 1602.</NOTE> or other capital crime. Thus, Alexander
Rowan had &s;entence of death, on conviction of bearing fire|arms,
and of theft;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 14. 1608.</NOTE> and Elliot, on conviction of the &s;ame
offence, and of &s;laughter. It is true, that on 18th Augu&s;t
1603, George Turnbull, for bearing and u&s;ing fire-arms, was
adjudged to lo&s;e his hand; but he was at the &s;ame time
charged with three acts of &s;laughter; of one of which he
emitted a confe&s;&s;ion, qualified only with this unfavourable,
though at that time lawful defence, that the per&s;on killed was
at the horn.</P>
<P>IT farther appears, that as early as Mackenzie's own time,
(who indeed remarks, that the bearing of arms was more
commonly libelled as an aggravation, than a crime), the&s;e
&s;tatutes were tending to go into di&s;u&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 24. 1673.</NOTE> In the trial of John
Nicol&s;on for murder, it was &s;tated in defence, that he was
fowler to a landed man, and as &s;uch carried a gun; and that
being abu&s;ed by the decea&s;ed at a mill, where he had called
for food to his dogs upon his way, his piece di&s;charged in
the &s;truggle, and thus the man was killed. The pro&s;ecutor
an&s;wered, that the bearing of fire-arms, either for fowling
or otherwi&s;e, was it&s;elf a crime, and could be of no &s;ervice
to his cau&s;e. But the Court &s;u&s;tained both the charge and
the defence.</P>

WITH regard to the keeping of arms in a per&s;on's habita|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keeping of Fire-arms.</NOTE>

was for a time forbidden, or laid under re&s;trictions, with

the puni&s;hment was carried to the greate&s;t height, and was

broad and liberal interpretation, according to the analogy

ob&s;ervance of the inhabitants of the land. Or, at lea&s;t, the&s;e
may be called in to &s;ettle the meaning of any doubtful pa&s;|&s;age,

of a capital offence; this is a far more doubtful po&s;ition.
Many have rather thought, that the one con&s;ideration in the
deci&s;ion of tho&s;e high intere&s;ts of life and death &s;hall be,
<HI>what hath the &s;tatute &s;aid;</HI> and that neither cu&s;tom, nor
analogy, nor inference of the purpo&s;e of the Legi&s;lature, has
here any ju&s;t claim to be regarded. How rigorous &s;oever the
enactment; as far as it is clear and po&s;itive, it mu&s;t be
obeyed. But in any point that is ambiguous or equivocal,
a &s;trict and literal con&s;truction to the &s;ide of mercy, may
&s;eem to be the only proper one to be applied to it. And as
to any blunder or defect of the &s;tatute, whereby the offend|er's
<PB N="291" REF="292">
life may be &s;aved; this (as it may here be e&s;teemed)
not unfortunate omi&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t not even out of deference to
erroneous precedents of judgment, and far le&s;s to popular in|clination
or belief, or from any regard to the regularity and
beauty of the law, be corrected or &s;upplied. At farthe&s;t;
if any exception is to be admitted to this rule, it can only
be of tho&s;e ca&s;es in which the connection is forbidden by the
law of nature, and the univer&s;al cu&s;tom of all nations; and
which for this rea&s;on only were not &s;et down in words by
the Legi&s;lature, that they were taken for granted, or were
held to be included in the broader &s;en&s;e of the general terms
made u&s;e of in the &s;tatute, or were too unnatural to be ima|gined.</P>
<P><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It may al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that the expre&s;&s;ions of the two &s;tatutes are not the &s;ame. The &s;tatute concerning marriage &startq;declares, That &s;ecunds in degrees of con&s;anguinity and affinity, and all degrees out with the &s;amin, contained in the word of the eternal God, <HI>and that are not repugnant to the &s;aid word,</HI> might, and may lawfully marry.&endq; The other relates only to tho&s;e &startq;who abu&s;es their body with &s;ic per&s;ons in degree, as God in his word, <HI>has expre&s;sly for|bidden.</HI>&endq; Perhaps the expre&s;&s;ions of the one, may be thought to admit a lati|tude of con&s;truction, which is excluded by tho&s;e of the other.</NOTE> THERE is another circum&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes; how to be con&s;trued.</NOTE> which may be thought
the more to recommend this rule of judgment in the pre|&s;ent
in&s;tance. The Legi&s;lature, at one time, had them|&s;elves
remarked the imperfections of the &s;tatute concerning
ince&s;t, and thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply them by farther
and more particular provi&s;ions. The &s;tatute 1649, c. 16.
proceeds upon the narrative of the act of James having omit|ted
&startq;many other degrees of ince&s;t, both in a&s;&s;inity and con|&s;anguinity,
no le&s;s heinous and puni&s;hable than tho&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ed
in the letter of that text, becau&s;e they be either
nearer or fully as near.&endq; And it therefore extends the
<PB N="292" REF="293">
appellation of ince&s;t, and applies the pains of death to all
ca&s;es of that de&s;cription, as contained in a table which is
&s;ubjoined to the act. This &s;tatute fell under the general
act reci&s;&s;ory of the U&s;urper's laws; whereby we are now
again referred to the Levitical law, as our &s;ole warrant and
direction; and thus there ari&s;es even a &s;tronger argument
for a &s;trict adherence to the words of that text, how defec|tive
&s;oever they may be found, than if no &s;uch &s;upplemen|tary
provi&s;ion had ever been thought nece&s;&s;ary to be made.</P>
<P>LET us therefore inquire how far the prohibitions of the
18th chapter of Leviticus extend.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prohibitions among <HI>Con&s;an|guinei.</HI></NOTE> And fir&s;t of <HI>con&s;anguinei,</HI>
or relations by blood.</P>
<P>1. IN the direct line of relation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the direct Line.</NOTE> the parent is forbidden
to know the child, (v. 7.), or the grandfather to know the
granddaughter, (v. 10.); and there is no farther expre&s;s
prohibition. But it has been doubted, whether the other
modes and more remote degrees of the direct relation, all
of which have equally the &s;anction of nature and of uni|ver&s;al
cu&s;tom on their &s;ide, may not be held to be included
under the terms of <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Daughter, Father</HI> and <HI>Mother,</HI>
which are perhaps employed in the text, in their broad and
loo&s;er acceptation.</P>
<P>2. AMONG the collateral relations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collaterals: Brother and Si&s;ter.</NOTE> there is an expre&s;s pro|hibition
to &s;i&s;ter and brother, whether uterine or con&s;angui|nean,
(v. 11. 9.). The &s;tatute was accordingly applied to
&s;uch a ca&s;e, within a few years after its date: for on the
2d February 1570, James and Agnes Bonnar, brother and
&s;i&s;ter, were convicted of ince&s;t and adultery, and had doom
to be burnt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 8. 1641. Jan. 28. 1642.</NOTE> Andrew Bannock al&s;o had &s;entence of death
<PB N="293" REF="294">
for ince&s;t with his &s;i&s;ter Margaret. And for this crime it
was, that Jean Weir, the &s;i&s;ter of the noted Major Weir,
was convicted and &s;uffered death, in April 1670.</P>
<P>A NEPHEW,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncle and Niece, Aunt and Ne|phew.</NOTE> likewi&s;e, is forbidden to know his aunt, (v. 12.
13.) whether by father or mother's &s;ide. And as to uncle
and niece, though nothing be expre&s;sly &s;aid; yet our prac|tice,
holding the guilt of the two offences, as the degree of the
relation, to be the &s;ame, and the prohibition of either to im|ply
the other, has in more than one in&s;tance applied the &s;tatu|tory
pains to this ca&s;e too; and this equally whether the rela|tion
were in full or in half blood. On the 8th February 1633,
John Baxter and Helen Sheviz, his niece by his &s;i&s;ter uterine
(as I under&s;tand the record<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Record calls her &startq;his &s;i&s;ter-doghter by the mother's &s;ide.&endq;</NOTE>), had &s;entence of death for
ince&s;t. As had James Strang, and Janet Strang, his niece
by his brother german, on the 24th April 1649. This was
before the pa&s;&s;ing of the act of that year, which would have
reached &s;uch a ca&s;e; and the like judgment was repeated in
later times, after that ordinance had been re&s;cinded. As in
the ca&s;e of George John&s;ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11. &amp; 18. 1705. Feb. 25. &amp; 26. and Mar. 4. 1706.</NOTE> and Janet John&s;ton, his bro|ther's

With re|&s;pect
to any of the more di&s;tant collateral rela|tions, the Le|vitical

thing relative to &s;uch ca&s;es in our records.</P>
<P>3. As to relations in affinity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Relations in the direct Line of Affinity.</NOTE> Father and daughter-in-law
are expre&s;sly forbidden, (v. 15.); as al&s;o, &s;on and &s;tep|mother,
(v. 8.); and father and &s;tepdaughter, (v. 17.); and
by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age, the like &s;eems to be true with re&s;pect to
the granddaughter of one's wife, begotten either of her &s;on
or daughter. Sentence of death accordingly pa&s;&s;ed on James
Wil&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 20. 1649.</NOTE> coal-grieve at Bonhard, for ince&s;t with his wife's
daughter, committed, (as the record has it), &startq;a threattie-five
year &s;ince or thereby.&endq; He had, on the &s;ame libel been
convicted of adultery; but with another woman, and not of
a capital nature.</P>
<P>WHEN we come to &s;peak of the collateral relations in af|finity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collateral Relations in Affinity.</NOTE>
we find more than one ca&s;e, with re&s;pect to which
there is much room for difference of opinion. A brother is
indeed expre&s;sly forbidden to know the wife of his brother,
(v. 16.); and to that effect we had an example of conviction
in the ca&s;e of Catharine Nairne and Patrick Ogilvy, in Au|gu&s;t
<PB N="295" REF="296">
1765. But whether under the term <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> which is employ|ed
in the text, we are to under&s;tand a brother's <HI>widow</HI> al&s;o
to be included; or &s;hall conceive the crime to be committed
by knowledge of the woman in the brother's lifetime only;
this is a que&s;tion which for &s;everal rea&s;ons, and e&s;pecially
by rea&s;on of a pa&s;&s;age in the book of Deuteronomy, (ch. xxv.
v. 5. <HI>et &s;eq.</HI>) which &s;eems rather to enjoin the marriage of her
as a duty, is attended with &s;ome difficulty. At one period, this
point inli&s;ted on the one or the other &s;ide, the whole Doctors
and theologians of Europe, as relative to the lawfulne&s;s of the
marriage between Henry VIII. and Catharine of Arragon,
the widow of his elder brother Arthur. With us, however,
judgment had once, at lea&s;t, been given upon the rigorous
&s;ide; for on the 19th November 1624, and upon a libel which
bore no charge but that of ince&s;t, Jeffray Irvine had &s;en|tence
to lo&s;e his head; having, it appears, begotten four
children on his brother's widow.</P>
<P>THERE is the like ground of &s;cruple with re&s;pect to the
&s;i&s;ter of one's wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Si&s;ter by Affini|ty.</NOTE> whom, in v. 18. one is indeed forbidden
to know, but then only in &s;uch terms, &startq;(in her lifetime),&endq;
and for &s;uch a rea&s;on, &startq;(to vex her<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Neither &s;halt thou take a wife to her &s;i&s;ter, to vex her, to uncover her nakedne&s;s, be&s;ide the other, in her lifetime.&endq;</NOTE>),&endq; as occa&s;ion &s;ome
difficulty of applying the rule to the other ca&s;e, of inter|cour&s;e
with the &s;i&s;ter of a wife, after the wife's decea&s;e.
Doubts have accordingly been entertained, as well by
divines as by lawyers, concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive marriage
of two &s;i&s;ters, whether it be not even a lawful, and to all
effects &s;ufficient marriage. Our practice affords, however,
one in&s;tance, of the pains of ince&s;t applied to this &s;itu|ation
al&s;o.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 8 &amp; 22. and Mar. 12. 1705.</NOTE> I allude to the ca&s;e of Barbara Tannahill;
<PB N="296" REF="297">
who had &s;entence of death for ince&s;t committed with the
&s;i&s;ter of his decea&s;ed wi&s;e; but on which conviction Lord
Roy&s;ton has this remark in his notes: &startq;<HI>Sed dubito an jure,</HI>&endq;
&startq;for, &s;ince King James's act has an expre&s;s reference to the
Judaical law, Levit. xviii. it ought not to be extended
to other ca&s;es not therein expre&s;sly mentioned.&endq;</P>
<P>As to examples of conviction in the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Ince&s;t with Si&s;|ter by Affinity.</NOTE> and more cer|tain
mode of the crime, which involves adultery as well as
ince&s;t; they have been more numerous, though they are all of
di&s;tant date. On the 17th July 1613, James Stewart, for
ince&s;t with Catharine Clogie, his wife's &s;i&s;ter, who bore him
a child, as appears in the lifetime of his wife, (though the li|bel
is laid for ince&s;t only), was condemned to be hanged, and
his body to be burned at the cro&s;s of Edinburgh. Sentence
of death al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed on Henry Dick in Bandrum, indict|ed
on the &s;tatute 1567, c. 14. for the procreation of a child
in ince&s;t and adultery, with Mary Douglas, the &s;i&s;ter of his
wife. This was on the 19th Augu&s;t 1629; but the Privy
Council, on the 6th April 1630, commuted the &s;entence
for bani&s;hment. I find a third in&s;tance of capital con|viction;
the ca&s;e of Donald Brymer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 17. 1649.</NOTE> who in the lifetime
of his wife Margaret, had a child by Janet Hutchie&s;on her
&s;i&s;ter. The libel was laid for the crime of ince&s;t only.</P>
<P>NEXT of the more di&s;tant collateral relations in affinity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aunt and Ne|phew by Affini|ty.</NOTE>
And here the que&s;tion &s;hall fir&s;t be &s;tated, as between the wife
and the blood relations of the hu&s;band. It is certainly ince&s;t,
(by v. 14.) if a woman know her hu&s;band's nephew by his
brother; and the charge was accordingly &s;u&s;tained in &s;uch
a ca&s;e, that of Elizabeth Smith and Thomas Hardy, of the
<PB N="297" REF="298">
12th November 1705<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The diet in this ca&s;e was afterwards de&s;erted.</NOTE>. Nay, in the ca&s;e of John Weir of
Clenachdike,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 25. 1629.</NOTE> the rule was extended to the marrying of the
<HI>relict of a gud&s;ire's brother,</HI> or grand-aunt, by affinity; for
which tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion this pannel had &s;entence to be beheaded.
With re&s;pect to a nephew by the hu&s;band's <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> though
certainly in it&s;elf &s;uch a ca&s;e &s;tands in the &s;ame degree of
guilt as the other, the text of Leviticus has &s;aid nothing;
nor have our Courts as yet had any opportunity of con&s;i|dering
the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>STATING the que&s;tion on the other part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncle and Niece by Affinity.</NOTE> with re&s;pect to
the hu&s;band and the blood-relations of the wife, &s;uch as her
niece or her aunt, our text almo&s;t entirely fail us; for upon
none of the&s;e ca&s;es has it either expre&s;sly ordered any thing, or
even furni&s;hed any clear indication of its purpo&s;e. Neverthe|le&s;s,
in two in&s;tances the &s;anction of the &s;tatute has been ap|plied
to this &s;ort of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion al&s;o. One is the ca&s;e of Alex|ander
Blair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 9. 1630.</NOTE> who was beheaded for ince&s;t committed after the
death of his wife, with Catharine Winram, the daughter of
his wife's brother in half blood. The other is the ca&s;e of
Alexander Gourlay of Southhead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 5. 1626.</NOTE> who being indicted for
ince&s;t with Euphemia Cor&s;torphine, &s;i&s;ter of his wife's mo|ther,
had his defences repelled, &startq;in re&s;pect of the libel, and
act of Parliament whereupon the &s;ame is founded<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This pannel had, however, a verdict in his favour.</NOTE>.&endq; But
to the&s;e we have to oppo&s;e the judgment in the later and
&s;tronger ca&s;e of Ali&s;on Beat&s;on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 13. &amp; 14. 1692.</NOTE> whereby the indictment
again&s;t her, which was laid upon the &s;tatute, for ince&s;t with
John Nicol, the hu&s;band of her mother's &s;i&s;ter, and al&s;o for
murder of the ince&s;tuous i&s;&s;ue, was, in the fir&s;t article,
<PB N="298" REF="299">
found relevant only to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;He mai&s;t &s;hamefully gave the u&s;e of his body to twa young damo&s;eils, baith being &s;i&s;ters, the ane namit Margarate Hender&s;on, and the other Cath|rane Hender&s;on, baith his &s;cholars, and young virgins, and thereby committed notour and manife&s;t ince&s;t.&endq;</NOTE>. She
was convicted both of the ince&s;t and the concealment of
her pregnancy, and e&s;caped with &s;entence of impri&s;onment
and tran&s;portation.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame inclination of our older practice to &s;everity
again&s;t offenders of this &s;ort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Illicit commerce with two Si&s;ters or Brothers.</NOTE> (but which is rather to be im|puted
to the general ca&s;t of the manners and opinions of
tho&s;e times, than to any peculiar di&s;po&s;ition of the Judges),
may be ob&s;erved in the following judgments; which pro|bably
would not be repeated now, if the like ca&s;es were
again to happen. On the 2d Augu&s;t 1628, George Sinclair<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">&startq;The Lords find the ince&s;t as libelled, relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;h|ment; and that article, that &s;he put violent hands on her child, relevant to in|fer the pain of death; but find the la&s;t part of the libel, anent her concealing her being with child, and not calling for help, &amp;c. only relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment.&endq;</NOTE>,
a &s;choolma&s;ter, convicted of carnal intercour&s;e with two &s;i&s;|ters,
of the name of Hender&s;on, his pupils, (along with cer|tain
other, but none of them capital offences), had &s;entence
to be drowned. On the 2d June 1643, Janet Imbrie was
convicted of lying &startq;and keeping company&endq; (as the record
has it), with John and Andrew Thom&s;on, two brothers; and
was condemned to be beheaded. The ca&s;e of Jean Knox, of
the 28th of May 1649, was of the &s;ame cla&s;s, but &s;till more
&s;hameful and &s;candalous: for this woman, being with child by
William Murray, had married and cohabited with his brother.
<PB N="299" REF="300">
She al&s;o had &s;entence of death. It is to be ob&s;erved of all
the&s;e convictions, that they were prior to the pa&s;&s;ing of the act
1649, which declared, that an affinity &s;hould equally be con|tracted
&startq;by unlawful company of man and woman as by
marriage.&endq; A fourth in&s;tance, which followed after the
repeal of that act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 20. 1669.</NOTE> was the ca&s;e of Callum Oig Macgregor,
who was charged, among other crimes, with that of ince&s;t;
having begotten a child on Elizabeth Macgregor, after &s;e|veral
children had been born to him, and all of them out of
wedlock, by Chri&s;tian Macgregor, her &s;i&s;ter. The libel
concluded for capital puni&s;hment, and was found relevant in
all its articles. The man was convicted (<HI>inter alia</HI>) of the
&startq;filthie and abominable crime of ince&s;t;&endq; and had &s;entence
of death accordingly.</P>
<P>Now, though it could not be di&s;puted, re&s;pecting any of the&s;e
connections, that they were very gro&s;s and &s;hameful immo|ralities,
and &s;uch as de&s;erved the cogni&s;ance of a criminal
court; yet it may well be doubted, whether, in any of them,
the offence amounted to the crime of ince&s;t, or was &s;ub|ject
to the &s;tatutory pains. The proper notion of that crime,
and which is announced in the text of the law of Mo&s;es, (v. 6.)
is the carnal knowledge of tho&s;e who <HI>are near of kin;</HI> and
in none of the&s;e ca&s;es, at the time of the facts libelled, was
there any relation between the pannel and either of the
objects of the illicit intercour&s;e. Even in the ca&s;e of Knox,
which is by far the &s;tronge&s;t of them, the crime could not
be made out without taking that into account, which was
committed while as yet the woman had no alliance to either
of the brothers; &s;o that the&s;e judgments &s;eem to have pro|ceeded
on the notion, adopted indeed and made law by the
act 1649, but which in it&s;elf &s;eems to be a loo&s;e and ground|le&s;s
<PB N="300" REF="301">
notion, of &s;ome &s;ort of affinity contracted through the
<HI>vaga venus,</HI> or <HI>unlawful company,</HI> (as it is termed in that law),
of man and woman. This opinion may now be given with
the le&s;s di&s;&s;idence, that in the later ca&s;e of Margaret Pa|ter&s;on,
who was indicted on the &s;tatute for ince&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 1. 1692.</NOTE> as having
been found naked, in bed, with David and James Kennedy,
brothers, the pro&s;ecutor thought it proper to depart from
the capital conclu&s;ion of his libel. This woman was con|victed,
and was ordered to &s;tand in the jugs for two hours,
and to be &s;courged and tran&s;ported.</P>
<P>ONE que&s;tion more which relates to this crime, is con|cerning
the ba&s;tard relations, (if &s;uch they may be called);
whether the&s;e, equally with the relations through lawful
wedlock, are objects of the &s;tatutory pains. It cannot indeed
be doubted, that in the fir&s;t and mo&s;t certain degree of that
connection, as between the mother and the &s;on, the offence
in it&s;elf is of equal enormity, and cannot e&s;cape without
&s;ome &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement. Yet &s;till, &s;ince the law &s;o utterly
di&s;regards this &s;ort of filiation, as to deny the child any of the
privileges or advantages of blood; &s;o there &s;eems to be &s;ome
difficulty of &s;ubjecting it to a &s;anction like that in que&s;tion,
which has only been created by po&s;itive &s;tatute, beyond what
the law of nature may &s;eem to require. This matter came
to be agitated in the trial of George and Janet John&s;ton;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 18. 1705.</NOTE>
who being indicted for ince&s;t, as uncle and niece, maintain|ed
this defence, that the woman was not the lawful, but
the ba&s;tard daughter of the man's brother. The pro&s;ecutor
an&s;wers, that legitimacy is to be pre&s;umed, &s;he being own|ed
as his daughter; and <HI>e&s;to,</HI> &s;he were his ba&s;tard, yet that
<HI>cognation</HI> al&s;o is &s;ufficient to infer the crime. The terms of

<P>To conclude: It is e&s;&s;ential to the guilt of this, as of all

have been in the knowledge of that circum&s;tance, wherein
lies the criminality of their act; &s;o that either of them,
who was then ignorant of the relation, (if &s;uch a thing &s;hould
happen), &s;hall be free of all puni&s;hment. But that the
ignorance of either, or even of both, &s;hall &s;u&s;tain the legiti|macy

that I &s;ee no good rea&s;on, why our practice &s;hould

<P>I SHALL not very much enlarge upon the next offence of
this cla&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIX.</NOTE>&mdash;Adultery,&mdash;which though it keep its place
in our &s;tatute-book, as a heinous, and in &s;ome ca&s;es a capital
crime, has not for many years been the &s;ubject of a criminal
pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>YET I think it is hardly to be doubted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adultery is a Point of Dittay.</NOTE> that our law has done
wi&s;ely in placing this high breach of moral and &s;ocial duty in
the li&s;t of crimes, in&s;tead of cla&s;&s;ing it, (which &s;eems to be the
ca&s;e in England), in the rank of a mere civil tre&s;pa&s;s, and ap|plying
the feeble cen&s;ure only of an award of damages; a &s;ort
of amends which truly has no &s;ort of proportion or relation
to an injury of this kind, which breaks in &s;o deeply on the
happine&s;s of the individual, and the welfare of a family, as
well as on the intere&s;ts of decency and public order. For even
with tho&s;e who are not corrupted by the example of infidelity,
it &s;till tends to weaken, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, that delicate and jea|lous
&s;en&s;e of honour, which is the &s;ure&s;t protection of female
virtue. What though the forfeit of the law is not exacted
in every in&s;tance: it in nowi&s;e follows that it is therefore
<PB N="303" REF="304">
an u&s;ele&s;s law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ADULTER.</NOTE> or without a &s;alutary influence on the man|ners
of the people. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion &s;till retains its de|gree
and character, as &s;ettled by authority of the nation
in the penal code; and to have been guilty of any thing
of which this is the de&s;cription, will always, with the &s;ober
and reputable part of the community, be attended with &s;o
much the more &s;hame and di&s;grace on that very account.
And to this provi&s;ion of our law it was, perhaps, in a
great mea&s;ure owing, (a thing not a little honourable to this
country, and which it were to be wi&s;hed that we had &s;till to
boa&s;t of), that down to a very late period, the notion of this
high wrong, as commen&s;urable with damages or pecuniary
reparation, had never been heard of in any Civil Court.</P>
<P>THOUGH directed to a &s;alutary purpo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes again&s;t Adultery.</NOTE> our ancient or|dinances
on this head, can, however, &s;carcely be vindicated
from the charge of exce&s;&s;ive &s;everity; and may indeed be &s;u|&s;pected
not &s;o much to have originated in any rational con&s;i|deration
of the injury, or a temperate regard to the public
good, as in that moro&s;e and au&s;tere temper, with which the
people of Scotland were infected at the Reformation, and
which occa&s;ioned an extreme antipathy to all irregular or
licentious intercour&s;e of the &s;exes. Be&s;ides, they had in this
matter the example of the law of Mo&s;es before them, which
puni&s;hed the adulterer with death; and in the fervency of
their zeal for the holy Scriptures, then fir&s;t laid open to
them in the vulgar tongue, they were ra&s;hly di&s;po&s;ed to in|fer,
that the rules of the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation were meant
for the indi&s;criminate ob&s;ervance of all times and countries.</P>
<P>1. OUR olde&s;t provi&s;ion on this &s;ubject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes con|cerning Adul|tery.</NOTE> is the act 1551.
c. 20. which pa&s;&s;ed before the downfal of Popery, and on|ly
<PB N="304" REF="305">
directed with re&s;pect to a common and incorrigible adul|terer,
that he &s;hould be put to the horn, and &s;uffer the or|dinary
con&s;equences of that &s;ort of rebellion. But the next
in date, the &s;tatute 1563, c. 74. which pa&s;&s;ed in the very
heat of the Reformation, makes a wide &s;tep, and at once ap|plies
the curb of the highe&s;t pains of law, to this (as it terms
it) &startq;abominabil and filthie vice and crime of adulterie,
which has bene perniciou&s;ly and wickedly u&s;ed within
this realm in times bygane.&endq; It enjoins the execution
of all former laws, made upon the matter of &s;imple or un|aggravated
adultery; and with re&s;pect to &startq;all notour or
manife&s;t committers of adulterie in onie time to cum,&endq; it
orders, that they &startq;&s;all be puni&s;hed with all rigour unto the
death, as weil the woman as the man, doer and commit|ter
of the &s;amin.&endq;</P>
<P>ADULTERY is thus di&s;tingui&s;hed in our practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Notour Adul|tery; what it is.</NOTE> into that
which is &s;imple, and that which is manife&s;t, or incorrigible,
and notour; of which la&s;t, this character is given in the act
1551, and is repeated, though in more general terms, in the
act 1563, that the parties per&s;i&s;t in their intercour&s;e, &startq;and
will not de&s;i&s;t and cea&s;e therefra, for feare of ony &s;piritual
juri&s;diction or cen&s;ures of halie kirk, to the great perrel
of their awin &s;aules;&endq; but &s;u&s;tain &startq;the proce&s;&s;e of halie
kirk, &s;a far as the &s;amin may extend to.&endq; But, by a later
&s;tatute, 1581, c. 105, which, under colour of explaining this
part of the older laws, in truth made a large addition to them,
but was ratified and ordered to be put to execution by the act
1701, c. 11. the appellation of <HI>notour</HI> was applied alike to the
three &s;everal ca&s;es, of adultery attended with procreation of
a child, or with open and notorious company and bedding
of the parties, or with contempt of the church's admonition,
given on the &s;u&s;picion and &s;candal of the &s;in, and with ex|communication
<PB N="305" REF="306">
for that contempt. In either of the two
former and &s;tronger ca&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 12. 1676.</NOTE> (as was found in the trial of Janet
Spence), no cour&s;e of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline is requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>IF Mackenzie's opinion in this matter were to be followed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes are the &s;ole Warrant of capital Pains.</NOTE>
even the&s;e are not the only degrees of adultery, to which the
highe&s;t pains of law may warrantably be applied. For, &s;ays
he, &startq;this act does not <HI>exclude</HI> capital puni&s;hment in other
ca&s;es of adultery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. Adultery, No. 3.</NOTE> but only ordains that the&s;e three degrees
<HI>&s;hall be</HI> puni&s;hed with death.&endq; But I think it may with
certainty be concluded, that in every in&s;tance where by a
correctory law, a crime not formerly capital is made &s;o as
to certain more heinous degrees; and where the&s;e degrees are
not left to opinion or con&s;truction, but are defined by a later
law in plain and expre&s;s terms; there is no room for the ex|tending
of this new &s;anction to any other ca&s;e, how fla|grant
&s;oever in it&s;elf, on any argument of proportion or ana|logy.
It might well be doubted, whether &s;uch a licence would
be warrantable, if it had even the countenance of tho&s;e pre|cedents,
to which Mackenzie in &s;upport of his own &s;entiment
has appealed. But in truth tho&s;e ca&s;es are no precedents at all
on the matter. The three adulteries in Sir John Stuart's ca&s;e
were all of them notour, by procreation of children. And
Margaret Hamilton was not executed, as Mackenzie has
&s;uppo&s;ed, under the certification purely of her fir&s;t &s;entence,
but upon a &s;econd conviction of another act of adultery,
committed after her return to Scotland, and of which a
child was born.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simple Adulte|ry is not capital.</NOTE> in the &s;ucceeding pa&s;&s;age to the above,
&s;eems to have advanced another que&s;tionable piece of doc|trine,
<PB N="306" REF="307">
when he argues, that even &s;imple adultery may, &startq;for
the good of the commonwealth,&endq; be puni&s;hed by the Ma|gi&s;trate,
at his di&s;cretion, with the highe&s;t pains. I cannot
find that there is even <HI>&s;cintilla juris</HI> for &s;uch an opinion. In|deed,
the contrary is implied in the whole &s;train and tenor
of the act 1563 it&s;elf, which on any other &s;uppo&s;ition was
an u&s;ele&s;s and even a hurtful law; and would have tended
to the encouragement rather than to &startq;the e&s;chewing&endq; of
the vice of adultery, which, as the preamble tells us, was the
motive of the Legi&s;lature. To &s;ay more on this head, may
be thought unnece&s;&s;ary after the judgment in the ca&s;e of
Nicol&s;on and Maxwell, (January 25. 1694), which in point|ed
terms<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Find the indictment as to the &s;imple adultery relevant to infer an arbi|trary puni&s;hment, and that there were bairns one or more procreate betwixt the pannels, or that they were notour and manife&s;t adulterers, likewi&s;e relevant to infer the pains of death libelled.&endq;</NOTE> di&s;tingui&s;hes the lawful pains of the two degrees.
In the later ca&s;e of Murdoch and Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 14. 1699.</NOTE> the Lord Advo|cate,
who had founded his libel for &s;imple adultery on the
Canon law, and at fir&s;t in&s;i&s;ted for a capital puni&s;hment,
found it nece&s;&s;ary in the end to depart from that conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that if there be any room for controver&s;y
touching the pains of &s;imple adultery, it will rather be, whe|ther
the Court have not in &s;ome in&s;tances gone too far, when
they have pronounced &s;entence of bani&s;hment or of &s;cour|ging;
&s;eeing that none of the later &s;tatutes are &s;pecial in that
re&s;pect, and that by the act 1551, the earlie&s;t of them all,
even a manife&s;t adulterer is only to &s;uffer the penalties of
denunciation at the horn.</P>
<P>BESIDE the per&s;onal con&s;equences which attend the con|viction
of adultery, our Legi&s;lature have thought proper to
<PB N="307" REF="308">
guard again&s;t that offence, by inflicting certain civil di&s;|abilities,
which may tend to le&s;&s;en the temptation, or are
material to the intere&s;t of other per&s;ons, the near connec|tions
of the parties. For the latter rea&s;on, a woman divor|ced
for adultery, who marries her paramour, or openly co|habits
with him, is by &s;tatute 1592, c. 119. di&s;abled to do
any deed re&s;pecting her real e&s;tate, to the prejudice of her
heirs. With a view to the former object, the &s;tatute 1600,
c. 20. declares the marriage of the adulterous parties to be
null and unlawful, and their i&s;&s;ue incapable of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To &s;peak of tho&s;e things which are common to both modes
of the offence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is adultery, though the Wo|man be &s;ingle, if the man is married.</NOTE> 1. Adultery, in our practice, is equally com|mitted,
whether it be that a married man has knowledge of
an unmarried woman, or that a married woman is known
by an unmarried man. It is true, the civilians and fo|reign
doctors have much di&s;puted<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Voet, Mathaeus, Clarus, and Van-Eck, maintain, that adultery was only committed <HI>cum nupta.</HI> Carp&s;ovius and Wi&s;&s;enbach take the lead in &s;upporting the more rigid opinion.</NOTE>, and not without plau|&s;ible
grounds, whether &s;uch was the rule of either the
civil law, or the law of Mo&s;es. And certainly it is not to
be denied, that the more heinous mode of the offence is in the
&s;eduction of a married woman, which at once dries up the main
&s;ource of the happine&s;s and welfare of the family; neither
can it be &s;aid, that the expre&s;&s;ions of our &s;tatutes are in them|&s;elves
deci&s;ive of the que&s;tion, either way. Yet our cu&s;tom,
(I think on the whole, with a wi&s;er policy and founder judg|ment,
though perhaps chiefly actuated in the beginning by
regard to the con&s;ideration of the &s;in, and the peril to the
&s;ouls of the parties), has always di&s;owned any &s;uch di&s;tinc|tion;
<PB N="308" REF="309">
and in this article, as in the matter of divorce, has
inve&s;ted the &s;pou&s;es with equal privileges, pre&s;cribed to both
one line of duty, and &s;ubjected them to the trial of the &s;ame
rigid and &s;alutary rule. Witne&s;s, among other in&s;tances which
might be mentioned, the ca&s;e of John Fra&s;er, and of Nicol|&s;on
and Maxwell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 17. 1673. Jan. 25. 1694.</NOTE> where this point underwent a full di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>2. IT is obvious, that there can be no adultery without
violation of the bond of a pre&s;ent and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting marriage.
Though the pannel have once been married; yet, if before
the date of the fact charged in the libel, the union has been
di&s;&s;olved by a regular divorce, the &s;pou&s;es are thereby re|&s;tored
to their free and &s;ingle &s;tate.</P>
<P>3. IN this I incline to differ from Mackenzie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Marriage was unlawful.</NOTE> who, in his
whole treati&s;e of Adultery, rather inclines to a rigorous con|&s;truction,
that I think the marriage mu&s;t not only be a &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting,
but a lawful marriage; &s;uch as is no infringement of
any of the prohibitions of the law on that head. For other|wi&s;e,
(as for in&s;tance, if it be contracted within the forbid|den
degrees); to puni&s;h the accu&s;ed for the violation of du|ties,
whereunto he is not truly bound, and in circum&s;tances
where he will be even puni&s;hable for continuing to adhere,
if he be in the knowledge of the impediment, &s;hould &s;eem
to be both incongruous and unju&s;t. To e&s;tabli&s;h the mar|riage,
is the fir&s;t, and a nece&s;&s;ary part of the trial upon eve|ry
libel for adultery; and if, at the &s;ame time that the ce|remony
is proved to have taken place, it is &s;hewn to have
been a vain and inefficacious ceremony, as to any effect of
begetting relation between the parties, or binding them to
the duties, or be&s;towing the rights and privileges, of the
<PB N="309" REF="310">
matrimonial &s;tate, the ca&s;e is the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance, as if
this part of the proof had entirely failed. That the pannel
was guilty in intention, does not obviate the objection; &s;ince
puni&s;hments are not inflicted in the temporal courts, for the
corrupt purpo&s;es or di&s;po&s;itions of the heart, but for the evil
and pernicious deeds which have been done in violation of
the laws.</P>
<P>ONE &s;ituation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Mar|riage challenge|able on the Head of Impo|tence.</NOTE> however, there is (though not very likely
to happen), which may &s;eem to warrant a con&s;truction not &s;o
favourable to the offender,&mdash;that of a marriage which is
liable to be re&s;cinded by rea&s;on of impotence. For although
lawyers have &s;poken of this defect as a nullity of the con|tract,
rather than a ground of divorce; yet it &s;eems to be
&s;uch a cau&s;e of challenge, as, in more re&s;pects than one, is
upon a very different footing from tho&s;e other and proper
nullities with which our books have cla&s;&s;ed it. The di&s;tinc|tion
lies here; that impotence, like adultery or de&s;ertion, is
of the nature of a pure per&s;onal cau&s;e of complaint; which
if the &s;pou&s;e her&s;elf di&s;&s;emble, no third party, upon any the
&s;tronge&s;t ground of patrimonial intere&s;t, (the heir for in&s;tance
of the decea&s;ed hu&s;band, in order to exclude the widow from
her terce), will be allowed to plead. In which it is quite
unlike a challenge on the ground of near relation or pre|vious
marriage; which are a common and public ground of
plea to all who can &s;how a proper intere&s;t in the trial of the
que&s;tion. Farther, in the&s;e &s;ituations there is an ab&s;olute im|pediment,
&s;uch as attaches to the act it&s;elf of the matrimonial
con&s;ent, and makes it vani&s;h at the very moment when it is
given; &s;eeing that, between per&s;ons who are &s;o circum&s;tan|ced,
the law forbids any &s;uch con&s;ent to be exchanged. Now,
it is quite otherwi&s;e in the ca&s;e of impotency. For, doubtle&s;s,
<PB N="310" REF="311">
if &s;o di&s;po&s;ed. the parties may lawfully, and without &s;candal,
or the breach of any precept, divine or human, continue to
live together; and far from being null, their act of con&s;ent,
(which by our law is alone the marriage, whether followed by
con&s;ummation or not), is in it&s;elf good at the time when given;
&s;o that if by any accident the couple &s;hould be &s;eparated af|ter
celebration of the ceremony, and be kept a&s;under again&s;t
their will, they would continue to be married per&s;ons for the
re&s;t of their lives. If, therefore, the party concerned &s;hall
di&s;&s;emble the grievance, and rather than have recour&s;e to the
remedy which the law has provided for &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;hall
choo&s;e to continue in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the civil &s;tate and cha|racter
of wife; &s;he has fairly made, and mu&s;t adhere to her
option, &s;ubject to all the duties, and that of fidelity among
others, which are incident to that relation; and whereof
the violation would be of the &s;ame evil example here, and
would occa&s;ion the &s;ame public &s;candal, as in any other ca&s;e.
This, however, is a nice que&s;tion, and of that &s;ort upon
which it may be very long before a court have any oppor|tunity
of giving their opinion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, p. 732.</NOTE> though I find that in one
in&s;tance &s;uch a plea had been made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>4. THOUGH there be a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting and unexceptionable mar|riage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Effect of Error&punc; as to the Sub|&s;i&s;tence of the Marriage.</NOTE>
yet &s;till adultery is no crime with re&s;pect to that one
of the pannels, where &s;uch there happens to be, who is ig|norant
of the married &s;tate of the other party. Becau&s;e, in
the&s;e circum&s;tances, not only is there no room for the charge
of any evil purpo&s;e; but it may be, (as for in&s;tance, in the ca&s;e
of a woman who is betrayed into a marriage with a man who
is already married), that this pannel is grievou&s;ly injured, and
&s;uffers even a greater wrong than the lawful &s;pou&s;e her&s;elf.
Hence, as this is not one of tho&s;e acts which in them&s;elves
<PB N="311" REF="312">
imply dole, and lay the proof of innocent intention on the
pannel, but, according to the circum&s;tances, may be either a
harmle&s;s act, or one of &s;ome inferior degree of guilt; &s;o it
&s;eems to lie with the pro&s;ecutor, in &s;upport of his libel, to
bring &s;uch a proof, either of the general notoriety of the
marriage, or of the pannel's &s;pecial knowledge of it, as may
make room for that <HI>malus animus,</HI> which is e&s;&s;ential to the
crime.</P>
<P>FARTHER, even with re&s;pect to that one of the parties
who is married, and again&s;t whom, in the common ca&s;e, a
pre&s;umption of dole mu&s;t lie; there &s;eems, neverthele&s;s, to
be room for a good plea, to the effect at lea&s;t of avoiding
the &s;tatutory pains of adultery, if he or &s;he, on probable
and rea&s;onable grounds, believed the marriage to have been
di&s;&s;olved by death: in which &s;ituation, not only can the
pannel not be ju&s;tly charged with the proper dole of the
crime, but even the &s;candal of the intercour&s;e is al&s;o in a
great mea&s;ure done away. With re&s;pect to the ju&s;t and &s;uffi|cient
grounds of &s;uch a belief; the&s;e are hardly to be deci|ded
by any general rule, but will be more proper for the
con&s;ideration of the jury on the whole circum&s;tances of the
particular ca&s;e: &s;uch as the long ab&s;ence of the party with|out
notice got of him; the common rumour and belief of
his decea&s;e; the accounts which have actually been recei|ved
to that effect; the pains be&s;towed to &s;earch the truth
of the&s;e accounts, and the like.</P>
<P>Two ca&s;es may perhaps be quoted as ho&s;tile to this indul|gence,
&mdash;that of John Fra&s;er in 1674, reported by Arnot,
(and perhaps related more correctly before him by Mac|kenzie),
and the ca&s;e of Janet Spence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 12. 26. and July 24. 1676.</NOTE> a &s;ailor's wife, who&s;e
defence, of the long ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band, and the common
rumour of his death, was repelled. But Fra&s;er had a pardon
before &s;entence; and Spence al&s;o, though convicted of no|tour
adultery, did not experience the utmo&s;t rigour of the law,
<PB N="312" REF="313">
but was &s;uffered to e&s;cape, (which at that time was a cour&s;e
of lenity), with &s;entence of tran&s;portation; having offer|ed
a &s;upplication to the Court, in which &s;he &s;et forth the
hard&s;hip of her ca&s;e. Indeed, it is far from being clear,
that the interlocutor in either of the&s;e in&s;tances was intend|ed
any otherwi&s;e than as a &s;pecial judgment on the particu|lar
grounds of error alleged for the&s;e pannels, as being &s;hort

were under his own peculiar guardian&s;hip, and whom he has

<PB N="313" REF="314">
which Mackenzie alludes to, is truly no precedent on the
other &s;ide; and this not only for the rea&s;on given by that
author, but becau&s;e the woman's allegation does not &s;eem to
have been pointed and &s;pecific, of her hu&s;band's privity to

&s;ay, (though without any purpo&s;e of denying that circum|&s;tantial
evidence mu&s;t &s;ometimes be received), that Macken|zie
&s;eems to be mi&s;taken in citing the ca&s;e of Janet Brown,
and that of Elizabeth Moor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 21. 1664. Dec. 10. 1668.</NOTE> as in&s;tances of conviction in that
way; for in the former there was one direct te&s;timony to
the fact, and in the other there were two. Of whichever &s;ort
the proof be, it mu&s;t be taken, (as in all other ca&s;es, excepting
trial for forgery), in pre&s;ence of the a&s;&s;ize them&s;elves;
who cannot lawfully pay regard to any decree of divorce
that may be produced<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The deci&s;ion to that effect, in the ca&s;e of Hay of Dalgety, Augu&s;t 1. 1598, which is mentioned by Mackenzie, was not given by the Court, who &s;eem to have allowed production of the decree, but by the jury, who divided upon the que&s;tion, nine to &s;ix.</NOTE> to them, nor to the te&s;timonies which
are there engro&s;&s;ed. And this, notwith&s;tanding what Mac|kenzie

rule, in the trial for &s;imple as for notour adultery.</P>

Marion Kempt and Patrick Robert&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 18. 1627.</NOTE> where the adulte|ry
was notour by procreation of children, (but here the

<P>THE in&s;tances are, however, numerous, of conviction of
this offence, joined to the murder of the adulterous i&s;&s;ue,

April 14. 1665. And here, in pa&s;&s;ing, it may be remarked
on the&s;e mi&s;erable ca&s;es of complicated guilt, that they fur|ni&s;h
(if any were needed) another evidence of the wi&s;dom of
our practice, in &s;tigmati&s;ing as a crime this &s;inful intercour&s;e,

which indeed will commonly involve the capital
&s;pecies of that offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;on why Bi|gamy is puni&s;h|ed.</NOTE> is bigamy; or the contracting of a
&s;econd marriage, &s;tanding the former. This, in every point
of view, is a great wrong, and high infringement of civil or|der:
being with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t &s;pou&s;e, a treacherous de&s;er|tion
of the many &s;erious and intere&s;ting duties, to which the
offender &s;tood &s;olemnly contracted; and with re&s;pect al&s;o
to the &s;econd &s;pou&s;e, where that per&s;on, (as commonly hap|pens),
is ignorant of the impediment, being a no le&s;s cruel
and infamous deceit; as well as with re&s;pect to the public,
it is a pre&s;umptuous and flagrant breach of that laudable
di&s;cipline and oeconomy, which the wi&s;dom of the nation
has e&s;tabli&s;hed for purpo&s;es of the highe&s;t importance.</P>
<P>AT the date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigamy, how puni&s;hable.</NOTE> however, of our only &s;tatute re&s;pecting biga|my,
the &s;tatute 1551, c. 19. this offence &s;eems chiefly to have
been con&s;idered in a religious point of view; as a &s;ort of
perjury, or violation of the &s;acrament and &s;olemn vow or
<PB N="316" REF="317">
oath, which was then u&s;ed in the contracting of marriage;
and with the proper pains of perjury, it was accordingly or|dained
to be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>1. THE mo&s;t important que&s;tion concerning the de&s;crip|tion
of bigamy relates to the quality of the two marriages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t both Mar|riages be by re|gular Celebra|tion.</NOTE>
which mu&s;t concur to it; whether both mu&s;t be marriages
by formal celebration, or if it will be &s;ufficient, though both
or one of them be contracted in that loo&s;e and unceremonious
fa&s;hion, which is &s;u&s;tained by the cu&s;tom of Scotland. In
this (as it mu&s;t be admitted to be) both delicate and important
inquiry, we have as yet no aid of precedent, nor even of
argument or debate to guide us. It is however obvious,
in favour of the more lenient opinion, that it has the counte|nance
of the general &s;train, and of &s;everal of the expre&s;&s;ions
of the &s;tatute<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;It is &s;tatute and ordained, that what&s;umever per&s;on marries twa &s;indrie wives, or women marries twa &s;indrie hu&s;bands, livand together, undivorced lawfully, contrair the <HI>aith and promi&s;e maid at the &s;olemni&s;ation and contracting of the matrimony,</HI> and &s;wa are of the law perjured and infamous, therefore, that the paines of perjuring be execute upon them with all rigour.&endq;</NOTE>, which was made at a time when there was
no marriage without celebration; and which, in applying
the pains of <HI>perjury</HI> to this offence, plainly &s;uppo&s;es the con|tempt
of a &s;olemn oath or vow, and an abu&s;e of the &s;ervice
of religion.</P>
<P>STATING the ca&s;e therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of both Marriages being without Cele|bration.</NOTE> (certainly the mo&s;t favourable
of any to the offender), of both connections being of this
ambiguous and equivocal character, as by promi&s;e and <HI>co|pula,</HI>
or court&s;hip and acknowledgments, or the like; it
may be urged for the pannel, that here has been no &s;olemn
<PB N="317" REF="318">
entry into the holy &s;tate, no pro&s;titution of the religious ce|remony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIGAMY, &amp;c.</NOTE>
or of the mini&s;try of the church. And farther, it
may be urged, on the merits of the que&s;tion in it&s;elf, that cir|cum&s;tances
&s;uch as the&s;e, relevant as they may be found in the
civil que&s;tion of &s;tate, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ometimes
decided on probabilities and pre&s;umptions, do not however
yield that clear and deci&s;ive evidence of dole, and of a &s;et|tled
purpo&s;e to marry and betray, without which there can
be no conviction of the crime of bigamy.</P>
<P>THIS argument will not &s;o &s;trongly apply to the ca&s;e of
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of a regu|lar Marriage fol|lowed with clande&s;tine In|tercour&s;e.</NOTE> who after having duly &s;olemni&s;ed a marriage, betakes
him&s;elf to &s;ome clande&s;tine and irregular connection. But
even for him, it may with &s;ome &s;how of rea&s;on be argued,
that as he well knew him&s;elf to be already married, and to
be for the time incapable of any &s;econd marriage; &s;o mu&s;t
it be pre&s;umed in his favour, as long as it po&s;&s;ibly can, and
until he take that deci&s;ive &s;tep of again undergoing the ce|remony,
which does not admit of an innocent con&s;truction,
that he had no wicked or deceitful purpo&s;e in that re&s;pect,
but truly, notwith&s;tanding any appearances of the contrary,
intended to carry on an intercour&s;e of a quite different &s;ort,
and for that very rea&s;on avoided the celebration of the ce|remony,
Be&s;ides, the party injured has not in the&s;e circum|&s;tances
the &s;ame rea&s;ons of re&s;entment and complaint, as one
who has been regularly married; having come into this
&s;ituation by the wilful neglect of tho&s;e precautions, and that
public order, by proclamation of banns, and &s;o forth, which
the law has in&s;tituted and devi&s;ed to this very end, of di&s;co|vering
all impediments to the propo&s;ed alliance.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="319">
A THIRD, and a le&s;s favourable ca&s;e to the offender than
either of the former,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of clan|de&s;tine Inter|cour&s;e $ior to regular Mar|riage.</NOTE> is that of a regular marriage &s;ub&s;e|quent
to &s;ome clande&s;tine connection; though I &s;hall not
a$$irm, that even here we have got the proper materials of
the crime of bigamy. At lea&s;t with re&s;pect to tho&s;e equi|vocal
and doubtful &s;ituations, (the mo&s;t frequent of any),
where the complainer has not been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
repute and &s;tate of a married woman, but is in the ca&s;e
of a mere claimant, or pretender to that character, upon
grounds not known with certainty to any but her&s;elf; it
&s;eems to merit con&s;ideration on the pannel's part, that po&s;|&s;ibly
after all he neither intended to marry, (notwith&s;tand|ing
what the civil court may have found), nor even un|der&s;tood
that a marriage could be effectually made in any
&s;uch way; and that in this opinion and belief he proceed|ed
publicly to contract him&s;elf to another woman.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e, however, alters materially to the di&s;advantage
of the pannel, if, in&s;tead of this &s;ecret and ambiguous in|tercour&s;e,
we &s;uppo&s;e the complainer to have been in the
full and continued enjoyment, not only of that degree of re|pute,
which a civil court, in ca&s;e of challenge, might po&s;|&s;ibly
&s;u&s;tain as &s;ufficient to make her a wife; but of that de|ci&s;ive,
public, and invariable character which hinders any
doubt to be moved upon the matter. And that the cri|minal
court would not, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, find the re|levant
qualifications of bigamy, it would certainly be ra&s;h to
&s;ay; though no ca&s;e of this character has yet happened,
to afford me any authority upon which I can affirm that &s;uch
is the law.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="320">
2. THUS much of the form of the two marriages. Next
of the other qualities which are required in the fir&s;t mar|riage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t Marriage mu&s;t be lawful:</NOTE>
to bring it under this &s;afeguard of the law.</P>
<P>RESPECTING this, it &s;eems to be clear, that it mu&s;t be a
lawful marriage; &s;uch which has not been contracted in con|tempt
of any of the injunctions of the law; as between tho&s;e
who are too near of kin, or who have been previou&s;ly con|victed
of adultery. As in every ca&s;e of this de&s;cription, the
contract is fundamentally null; &s;o it &s;eems to be all one, as
if the ceremony had never been performed: And it were
ab&s;urd to imagine, that the law &s;hall employ its vengeance
in defence of that which it&s;elf hath forbidden. Touching
a marriage that is challengeable by rea&s;on of impotence, the
&s;ame ob&s;ervations will apply, which were made in treating
of the crime of adultery.</P>
<P>3. THE marriage mu&s;t not only be a lawful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing.</NOTE> but a &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting
marriage. If, before the &s;econd marriage, the fir&s;t
has been di&s;&s;olved by divorce in the cour&s;e of law, the
parties are again free to contract anew. And this the
&s;tatute it&s;elf, equally as the rea&s;on of the thing, indicates,
when, &s;peaking of the &s;pou&s;es, it u&s;es the&s;e terms, &startq;li|vand
together undivorced, lawfully;&endq; which mu&s;t either
mean <HI>living together, lawfully married, and undivorced,</HI> (which
is the more natural &s;en&s;e), or it mu&s;t mean, <HI>living together,
and not &s;eparated by any lawful divorce.</HI> Which&s;oever be the
true con&s;truction, Mackenzie's remark &s;eems to be equally
ju&s;t; that though the decree of divorce be afterwards &s;et
a&s;ide, yet &s;till it &s;hall afford a good defence to the party,
who, in the mean time, on the faith of it, and before any
challenge of it has been moved, proceeds to form another al|liance.
But the exception al&s;o from this rule &s;eems to be no
le&s;s &s;uitable, in ca&s;e of the reduction taking place upon any
<PB N="320" REF="321">
of tho&s;e grounds, of bribery, &s;uborned evidence, or other
evil device on the part of the pannel, which imply the dole
and malice of the contriver, and cannot therefore, in any
que&s;tion, re&s;ult to his advantage<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Twelve Judges of England were of this opinion in the Dutche&s;s of King&s;ton's ca&s;e, upon allegation of a collu&s;ive decree of jactitation. April 1776.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>4. THERE &s;eems to be the &s;ame rea&s;on here, as in ca&s;es of
adultery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Bigamy owing to Error.</NOTE> for admitting a proof on the part of the pannel,
that the former marriage was truly, and on rea&s;onable
grounds, believed to have been di&s;&s;olved by death. John
Campbell was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. 1680.</NOTE> however, convicted of bigamy, and &s;enten|ced
to the &s;tatutory pains, upon the pure evidence of his
own confe&s;&s;ion, which bore, (though to be &s;ure, without any
&s;pecification of the grounds of his opinion), that he believed
his fir&s;t wife to have been dead.</P>
<P>5. IN regard to the &s;econd marriage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the &s;e|cond Marriage be ince&s;tuous, &amp;c.</NOTE> if it be formal and ce|remonious,
it matters not how vitious and exceptionable it
be in other re&s;pects. It is always a null marriage, as con|tracted
&s;tanding a former; and if it be al&s;o an ince&s;tuous,
adulterous, or otherwi&s;e forbidden marriage, this additional
fault cannot take away the guilt, or protect again&s;t the pains
of bigamy.</P>
<P>6. THE guilt of the offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of Bigamy.</NOTE> according to circum&s;tances,
may either be the exclu&s;ive guilt of that one of the par|ties
in who&s;e per&s;on there is a double marriage; or it may
be the common guilt of both the parties to the &s;econd mar|riage,
although to one of them it be the fir&s;t contract of
that &s;ort. The former holds with re&s;pect to the &s;econd wife,
<PB N="321" REF="322">
(or hu&s;band, as the ca&s;e happens to be), who knew not of the
impediment of the former marriage; and who in this &s;itu|ation
not only is in nowi&s;e criminal, but has been cruelly
betrayed, and is perhaps the greate&s;t &s;ufferer of any. But
if the &s;econd wife has been in the knowledge of the impedi|ment;
then, though there be no proper bigamy in her own
per&s;on, as contracting for the fir&s;t time, yet is &s;he art and
part of the bigamy committed by the man, and committed
through her aid, who knows, adopts, and deliberately con|&s;ummates,
the intended wrong. The &s;ame is true of the prie&s;t
who marries the couple, if he is in the certain knowledge of
the prior and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting marriage; and this equally whether
there be or be not impo&s;ition by one of the parties who come
before him, on the other: For &s;till he accompli&s;hes an act of
bigamy, and pro&s;titutes his holy office to the doing of that
which he knows to be &s;inful and criminal. The witne&s;&s;es
&s;hall likewi&s;e be art and part, if they, being privy to the
fact, and to the intended fraud, have aided in the execution
of it, by wilfully concealing the truth from the prie&s;t, or
from either of the parties. Whether their pre&s;ence at the
ceremony will be &s;ufficient to implicate them, in the ca&s;e
that all concerned are appri&s;ed of the true &s;ituation of
things, may be more doubtful, and is undecided. That the
&s;tatute only &s;peaks of men &startq;wha marries twa &s;indrie wives,&endq;
or &startq;women wha marries twa &s;indrie hu&s;bands,&endq; is no ar|gument
again&s;t conviction on the&s;e grounds. It was the bu|&s;ine&s;s
of the Legi&s;lature to create, and in a general way to
de&s;cribe the body of the main offence; which, when once
con&s;tituted, and made a part of the &s;y&s;tem, falls to be judged
of in the matter of acce&s;&s;ion, and other relative doctrines,
according to the ordinary rules of law and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="323">
7. THE &s;tatute not only appoints the pains to be tho&s;e of
perjury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutory pains of Bigamy.</NOTE> but has al&s;o &s;aid what tho&s;e pains &s;hall be under|&s;tood
to be. &startq;That is to &s;ay, confi&s;cation of all their gudes,
moveable, warding of their per&s;ones for zeir and day, and
langer induring the Queenes will, and as infamous per|&s;ons,
never able to bruick office, honour, dignitie, nor be|nefice
in time to cum.&endq; This direction has not however,
in every in&s;tance, been &s;trictly complied with. John Job
workman in Leith, was whipped and bani&s;hed for bigamy,
on 19th June 1650.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 9. 1630. Mar. 9. 1631.</NOTE> And William Lauchlan, for the &s;ame
crime, was bani&s;hed.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Same fact may be Bigamy and Notour Adulte|ry.</NOTE> that it may &s;ometimes depend on
the pro&s;ecutor's plea&s;ure to libel the &s;ame fact as bigamy, or
as notour adultery, (that is, by procreation of children,
of open cohabitation of the parties); under which la&s;t appel|lation,
he may even relevantly in&s;i&s;t in a capital conclu&s;ion.
Upon this footing, John Guthrie, <HI>alias</HI> William Laird, had
&s;entence of death, March 14. 1617. And on the &s;ame
ground, libel for notour adultery was &s;ent to an a&s;&s;ize,
and a conviction obtained, in the ca&s;e of John Fra&s;er, writer
in Edinburgh, in November 1673. Nor can the&s;e proceed|ings
be quarrelled as unlawful; &s;ince the adultery certainly is
not the le&s;s &s;uch, nor the le&s;s &s;candalous and manife&s;t, for
being attended with the fal&s;e a&s;&s;umption of the character of
man and wife. And perhaps to this very rea&s;on, that biga|my
could be puni&s;hed to &s;uch an extend in the more aggra|vated
ca&s;es, it was owing, that the pains of that offence were
not made the &s;ubject of a new and more &s;evere enactment,
at the &s;ame time with tho&s;e of adultery and ince&s;t, and
the other crimes of the &s;ame cla&s;s, which were all &s;ubjected
<PB N="323" REF="324">
to a more rigorous cour&s;e of di&s;cipline at the period of the
Reformation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLANDESTINE. MARRIAGE.</NOTE></P>
<P>I HAVE occa&s;ionally mentioned the few in&s;tances of pro&s;e|cution
for this crime, that I have found in the books of ad|journal.</P>
<P>II. THE offence of clande&s;tine marriage, naturally con|nects
with that of bigamy. It is committed by the non-ob|&s;ervance
of that laudable and public order in the contract|ing
of marriage, which the law, for obvious and &s;alutary
purpo&s;es, has enjoined. It is well known, that the cu&s;tom of
Scotland impo&s;es very little re&s;traint on the inclinations of
&s;uch per&s;ons, who are de&s;irous of entering into the &s;tate of
matrimony. They may accompli&s;h their union, not only
without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance of religion or the church, but even
without the u&s;e of any appointed civil form; &s;o the couple
them&s;elves, though unauthori&s;ed by the will of parents, or
guardians, do explicitly, fully, and deliberately con&s;ent. But
although our law, which in this &s;eems to be guided upon
the whole by wi&s;e and liberal con&s;iderations of policy, does
permit and &s;uffer, yet it by no means approves, or would en|courage,
the contracting of marriage in this private and
unceremonious fa&s;hion; attended as it is with the plain ha|zard,
not only of ra&s;h and un&s;uitable matches, but of ince&s;|tuous,
adulterous, or otherwi&s;e unlawful alliances. On the
contrary, it be&s;tows on all marriage of this de&s;cription,
the name of clande&s;tine and di&s;orderly; and holds no mar|riage

made to this la&s;t application of the law, that the &s;tatute 1661
pa&s;&s;ed at a time when Epi&s;copacy was the communion by
law e&s;tabli&s;hed. For the&s;e re&s;traints are not to be con&s;idered
as having been in&s;tituted by way of favour or privilege

to others, but for the general benefit of the people, and bet|ter

Being thus founded upon rea&s;ons of a general and perma|nent

of communion or church-government; in like manner as the

any manner of call or ordination, and is therefore utterly
inexcu&s;able, and guilty of a &s;till more indecent and audacious
breach of order, in meddling with any of the functions of
<PB N="327" REF="328">
that holy office. Such a charge, among others, was brought
upon the &s;tatute 1661, again&s;t George Craighead, as a per&s;on
who fal&s;ely a&s;&s;umed the character of mini&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5. &amp; 6. 1750.</NOTE> and took up|on
him to celebrate marriages; and being convicted, he was
bani&s;hed from Scotland, under pain of death in ca&s;e of re|turn.</P>
<P>IT is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Marriage declared before a Magi&s;trate.</NOTE> it &s;ometimes happens, that a couple go into the

thing unlawful on the part of the Magi&s;trate, who does not
pretend to marry them, or at all to officiate in the matter,
but merely &s;erves as a reputable witne&s;s of the act and ci|vil

to be maintained; as well as it is particularly requi|red
in that clau&s;e of the &s;ame &s;tatute, which relates to the
marriage of Scots per&s;ons in England. It is &s;pecially men|tioned
in the act 1695, c. 12. which is a temporary regula|tion,
relative to the &s;ame &s;ubject. And, &s;till more fully and
expre&s;sly, it is recogni&s;ed as a nece&s;&s;ary article of the order
of marriage, by &s;tatute 10. Anne, c. 7. which forbids the

the former of whom was convicted, but &s;uffered no judg|ment,
that I have been able to di&s;cover. This was al&s;o part
of the charge again&s;t the afore&s;aid George Craighead, who
was indicted for marrying a girl of thirteen, to one who had
a wife alive; which accu&s;ation was found relevant in gene|ral
terms, and i&s;&s;ued in a verdict again&s;t the pannel. Far|ther;
on the 18th March 1768, but only on his own petition,
Peter Wil&s;on had &s;entence of bani&s;hment for marrying with|out
banns proclaimed, or the con&s;ent of relations.</P>
<P>THE charge of this mode of the offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of non-proclamation of Banns.</NOTE> as it involves
the allegation of a negative, is attended with this peculia|rity,
that the pro&s;ecutor, proving the celebration of the mar|riage,
and that no certificate of proclamation of banns was
on that occa&s;ion produced to the mini&s;ter, (for I conceive
that this at lea&s;t may certainly be exacted of the pro&s;ecu|tor),
has &s;ufficiently made out his ca&s;e; and thus transfers to
the pannel, the burden of &s;howing, (which, however, in any
in&s;tance where it is true, mu&s;t be always within his power),
that proclamation was duly made. If a fal&s;e or forged cer|tificate
of proclamation has been pre&s;ented to the mini&s;ter;
this will ordinarily be to him a &s;ufficient excu&s;e, who is not
blameable for failing to &s;u&s;pect &s;uch an impo&s;ition. But as
clear it is, that if he be privy to or contriver of the device,
(as &s;ometimes happens), for the purpo&s;e of procuring to him|&s;elf
an o&s;ten&s;ible warrant of his wrong; then not only &s;hall he
be &s;till puni&s;hable for his own proper guilt as celebrator, not|with&s;tanding
this &s;ubtile precaution; but it may even be true,
(according to the lengths he has gone), that he &s;hall be art
and part of the fal&s;ehood and abu&s;e of tru&s;t committed by the
&s;e&s;&s;ion-clerk; for which that per&s;on is doubtle&s;s an&s;werable,
not to his con&s;tituents only, but al&s;o to the public and the
<PB N="330" REF="331">
law. If the mini&s;ter admit that no certificate of proclama|tion
was &s;hown to him, but plead that the parties fal&s;ely af|firmed
to him, that the law had been complied with; whether
this, of it&s;elf, is to be allowed as a good defence, may well be
doubted<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This point was argued in the papers in Muir's ca&s;e; but the interlocutor is in terms which do not imply any deci&s;ion of it.</NOTE>: For in prudence he ought not to credit any
&s;uch averment, but ought rather to be &s;u&s;picious of the want
of this, the regular, and ordinary, and acce&s;&s;ible &s;ort of evi|dence
on the &s;ubject. Of it&s;elf, therefore, it will &s;carce|ly
excu&s;e him, that the parties alleged &s;o; which he
might po&s;&s;ibly give no credit to, or might very well un|der&s;tand
to be fal&s;e. But, that he was truly over-reached
and impo&s;ed on, &s;eems to be a relevant allegation, which
mu&s;t be open to a proof on the pannel's part; if by a train
of facts and circum&s;tances he can fully make it out.</P>
<P>THESE &s;eem to be the only modes of this offence that
are the objects of the &s;tatutory pains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Common Law on this &s;ubject.</NOTE> agreeably to the pre|&s;ent
rules of the Church, as recogni&s;ed in law; for along
with tho&s;e rules, if &s;tatute &s;hall make any addition to them,
the term of clande&s;tine marriage will extend its meaning.
In default of the&s;e, the common law, of its own native
&s;trength, is &s;ufficiently powerful to repre&s;s &s;ome of the higher
abu&s;es in this quarter; if they are conducted in &s;uch a man|ner,
as to bring them under any of the other and larger deno|minations
of crime. Thus, it was a &s;eparate article of charge
again&s;t George Craighead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5. &amp; 6. 1750.</NOTE> and was laid upon the common law,
and went to the jury along with the other articles, that he
had fal&s;ely a&s;&s;umed a fictitious name, and the character of
clergyman, and under the&s;e had married, and given certifi|cates

the per&s;onage and performing the part of clergyman,
which neither really nor by preten&s;ion belongs to him; he
&s;eems to be a criminal and fal&s;e impo&s;tor, or cheat, whom
the common law may therefore cha&s;ti&s;e.</P>
<P>3. BY a clau&s;e in the act 1661,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Pro|&s;ecutor.</NOTE> the Procurator for the

as they are attended with &s;ome hazard to the peace and &s;e|curity
of the inhabitants of the land, both in property and
per&s;on.</P>
<P>1. THE fir&s;t that I &s;hall mention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Egyptians; thei$ Hi&s;tory.</NOTE> is the offence of being
one of the per&s;ons called Egyptians, or Gyp&s;ies. Re&s;pect|ing

by that name, (who &s;eem to have been fir&s;t taken
notice of about the year 1417), little more &s;eems to be known
with any certainty, than that they were not an accidental
a&s;&s;ociation of vagabonds, but a di&s;tinct and unmingled race
<PB N="338" REF="339">
of foreigners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXII.</NOTE> who travelled into Europe from the ca&s;t<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Graelman, a German author, who has written a treati&s;e on this &s;ubject, with con&s;iderable learning, endeavours to &s;how from their manners, in&s;titutions, and language, that they were Hindoos of the lowe&s;t ca&s;t, who had been driven from their native country, by the conque&s;ts of Tamerlane.</NOTE>.
They fir&s;t appeared in Hungary and Bohemia, (the countries
where they are &s;till in the greate&s;t numbers, and hence in
France they are called Bohemians), and &s;eem to have given
them&s;elves out for a &s;et of holy men or pilgrims, who were
upon this expedition by way of penance, or on &s;ome reli|gious
account. As &s;uch they accordingly received pa&s;&s;es
and recommendations from the Princes in that quarter; by
means of which, and under the direction of their chiefs,
(or Dukes and Kings as they cho&s;e to call them), they quick|ly
pa&s;&s;ed into and over&s;pread all the other kingdoms of
Europe.</P>
<P>IT was however &s;oon found, that their manners, and their
morals, did by no means corre&s;pond to the &s;anctity of their
pretended errand; and as new &s;warms of them were con|tinually
coming forward, which were joined by all the idle
and di&s;&s;olute of every country on their way; they came to
be felt as an intolerable nui&s;ance, and in the cour&s;e of the
16th century were every where proceeded again&s;t as &s;uch.
They were bani&s;hed out of Spain in 1492; out of Germany
by an Imperial Con&s;titution of 1500; out of France by an
edict in 1561, and by another in 1612; and out of England,
by &s;tatute of the 22d of Henry VIII.</P>

incorrigible. But all ordinary means having proved in&s;uffi|cient
to re&s;train &s;o numerous and &s;o &s;turdy a crew, the Privy
Council at length, in June 1603, were induced to venture
on the more effectual expedient, (recommended by the ex|ample
of &s;ome other realms), of at once ordering the whole
race to leave the kingdom by a certain day, and never to
return under the pain of death. A few years after, this pro|clamation
was converted into a perpetual law, by &s;tatute
1609. c. 13.; with this farther convenient, but very &s;evere pro|vi&s;ion
towards the more effectual execution of the order,
that it &s;hould be lawful to condemn and execute them to
the death, upon proof made of the &s;ingle fact, &startq;that they
are called, known, repute and holden Egyptians.&endq; The
&s;tatute annuls at the &s;ame time all protections and warrants
purcha&s;ed by the Egyptians from his Maje&s;ty or Privy Coun|cil,
for their remaining within the realm; as al&s;o all pri|vileges
purcha&s;ed by any per&s;on to re&s;et, entertain, or do
them any favour. It appears, indeed, from a paper in the
appendix to Maclaurin's Ca&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No. 29.</NOTE> that even the King's &s;ervants
and great officers had not kept their hands entirely pure of
this &s;ort of treaty with the Egyptian chiefs; from whom
&s;ome &s;upply of money might in this way be occa&s;ionally
ob|tained.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t gyp&s;ies that were brought to trial on the &s;tatute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trails on the&s;e Statutes.</NOTE>
were four per&s;ons of the name of Faa; who on the 31&s;t
July 1611, had &s;entence to be hanged. They had pleaded
upon a &s;pecial licen&s;e from the Privy Council to abide with|in
the country; but this appearing to be clogged with a
condition of finding &s;urety for their appearance when
called on, and their &s;urety being actually at the horn, for
<PB N="340" REF="341">
failure to pre&s;ent them; they were held to have infringed the
terms of their protection.</P>
<P>THE next trial was on the 19th and 24th July 1616, in the
ca&s;e of other two Faa's and a Baillie (which &s;eem to have
been the mo&s;t noted names among the gyp&s;ies); and here
was &s;tarted that plea which has &s;ince been repeated in al|mo&s;t
every ca&s;e, but has always been over-ruled, viz. that
the act and proclamation were temporary ordinances, and
applicable only to &s;uch Egyptians as were in the coun|try
at their date. The&s;e pannels, upon conviction, were or|dered
by the Privy Council to find caution to the extent of
1000 merks to leave Scotland, and never to return; and ha|ving
failed to comply with this injunction, they were in con|&s;equence
condemned to die.</P>
<P>IN January 1624,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trials of Egyp|tians. Jan. 23. and 24.</NOTE> follows a &s;till more &s;evere example; no
fewer than eight men, among whom Captain John Faa, and
other five men of the name of Faa, being convicted, and doom|ed
to death on the &s;tatute. Some days after, there were
brought to trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 29.</NOTE> Helen Faa, relict of the Captain, Lucretia Faa,
and other women, to the number of eleven; all of whom
were in like manner convicted, and condemned to be drown|ed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;The a&s;&s;ize for the mai&s;t part findis, that the per&s;ones on panell, are vaga|boundis, and repute and holdin for Egyptianis, and be their remaining within this kingdome, and nocht removeing thaime&s;elfis furth yrof, conforme to the act of Parliament, findis thaime, and everie ane of thaime, giltie and culpable of contravening thereof.&endq;</NOTE>.
But in the end, their doom was commuted for bani&s;h|ment,
(under pain of death), to them and all their race.
The &s;entence was, however, executed on the male convicts;
and it appears that the terror of their fate had been of ma|terial
<PB N="341" REF="342">
&s;ervice; as for the &s;pace of more than 50 years from
that time, there is no trial of an Egyptian.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of that century,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trials of Egyp|tians.</NOTE> the nui&s;ance &s;eems
to have again become trouble&s;ome. On the 13th of De|cember
1698, John Baillie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 13. 15, 19. 1698.</NOTE> and &s;ix men more of the &s;ame

Egyptians, and al&s;o for &s;undry &s;pecial mi&s;deeds; and being
convicted, (all but the woman), they were ordered for execu|tion.
But on this ca&s;e, it is to be remarked, that the Court
had &s;o far departed from the rigour of the &s;tatute, as not to
&s;u&s;tain a relevancy on the habit and repute of being an

&s;ome proof of actual guilt in aid of the evil fame. In

<P>THIS lenient cour&s;e of dealing with the gyp&s;ies, was not

and this point of dittay been reduced to be no otherwi&s;e
of a capital nature, than in the qualified and more rea&s;onable
&s;en&s;e above explained. It is true, that the fame of being an
Egyptian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 29. and Nov. 12. 1751. Aug. 9. &amp; 13. 1770.</NOTE> was part of the <HI>charge</HI> in Wil&s;on and Macdonald's

and ordinary terms, inferring <HI>the pains of law;</HI> and
a conviction followed of &s;uch facts which were capital of
them&s;elves, without any regard to the character or habits of
the men.</P>
<P>TOUCHING the proof of &s;uch a charge (if ever it &s;hall again
be the &s;ubject of a &s;pecial inquiry):<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nece&s;&s;ary Proof on this Sort of Charge.</NOTE> It will not be &s;ufficient

&s;orner, vagabond, or thief; or that he is addicted to tho&s;e
pilfering and vitious cour&s;es, which are common to Egyp|tians
with other wandering and di&s;&s;olute &s;ocieties. The &s;pe|cial
opinion of him as an Egyptian, or one of a different breed
from the other inhabitants of this land, mu&s;t be e&s;tabli&s;hed;
<PB N="345" REF="346">
and this proceeding on tho&s;e noted and peculiar circum&s;tan|ces

that they have vi&s;ited, this loo&s;e and lazy race have &s;o re|markably
been di&s;tingui&s;hed. Among the&s;e &s;ome of the chief
are the black eye and &s;warthy complexion,&mdash;a peculiar lan|guage,

of living (as far as the climate will permit), in &s;olitary places
and in the open air<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Mackenzie's Ob&s;. on Stat. p. 333.&mdash;4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>II. ALONG with the crime of being an Egyptian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sorning a great Oppre&s;&s;ion for|merly in Scot|land.</NOTE> we
may rank the kindred, and al&s;o capital offence of SOR|NING;
being one of the many evil habits to which that
profligate and &s;turdy crew have every where been addict|ed.
By &s;orning we under&s;tand the <HI>ma&s;terful</HI> taking of meat
and drink without payment; a thing which in the for|mer
undi&s;ciplined &s;ituation of this country, (happily ve|ry
remote from the pre&s;ent), tho&s;e numerous bands of
di&s;&s;olute and lawle&s;s people ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed, more e&s;pe|cially
in remote and &s;olitary &s;ituations, where they chiefly
haunted, by the very terror of their looks and appearance,
and their known violent and vindictive temper. The &s;tate
of Scotland in this re&s;pect, if we may tru&s;t the de&s;cription
that is given of the numbers and the manners of tho&s;e va|gabond
fraternities, by one who was able to judge and had op|portunity
of knowing, was indeed &s;uch as we have now &s;ome
difficulty to imagine. Fletcher of Salton, in a treati&s;e writ|ten
in 1698, affirms that the numbers who lived as vagabonds,
even in ordinary times, (and in that year of dearth they were
double), amounted to at lea&s;t a hundred thou&s;and; who (he
<PB N="346" REF="347">
&s;ays) might be &s;een on all occa&s;ions of public meeting, both
men and women, perpetually drunk, cur&s;ing and bla&s;phe|ming,
and fighting together; who lived without any regard
or &s;ubjection either to the laws of the land, or even tho&s;e
of God and nature; fathers ince&s;tuou&s;ly accompanying
with their own daughters, the &s;on with the mother, and the
brother with the &s;i&s;ter; and of whom no Magi&s;trate could
di&s;cover that ever they were baptized, or which way one
in a hundred of them died. &startq;They are not only (&s;ays
he) a mo&s;t un&s;peakable oppre&s;&s;ion to poor tenants, (who
if they give not bread or &s;ome kind of provi&s;ion to per|haps
forty &s;uch villains in one day, are &s;ure to be in&s;ulted
by them), but they rob many poor people who live in
hou&s;es di&s;tant from any neighbourhood<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Second Di&s;cour&s;e on the Affairs of Scotland, p. 145.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>IN like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes again&s;t Sorning.</NOTE> the &s;tatute-book, in its numerous provi|&s;ions
again&s;t &s;orners, bears ample te&s;timony to this intole|rable
grievance. In &s;ome of the&s;e they are de&s;cribed as
&startq;companies overlyand the King's lieges,&endq; in others &startq;as
overliers and ma&s;terful beggars with hor&s;e hounds and
other gudes,&endq; or as tho&s;e &startq;that daily oppre&s;&s;is and

bani&s;hed, and in ca&s;e of return to be hanged; and more di|rectly
&s;till, (though probably intended for the ca&s;e of a

any in&s;tance of death inflicted for &s;orning &s;ingly;

&s;orners were commonly addicted, it &s;ometimes was the
ground of a capital &s;entence; as for in&s;tance in the fore&s;aid
ca&s;e of the Macgibbons.</P>
<P>THE proper de&s;cription of &s;orning is the taking of meat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cription of the Crime.</NOTE>
drink, or victuals only, and not of free-quarters; though this
practice al&s;o, which indeed is a wrong of its own &s;ort, has
&s;ometimes been inaccurately added to the de&s;cription of it
in indictments. But the interlocutor in the ca&s;e of Kerr
and Yor&s;ton &s;pecially limits &s;orning to the kinds above men|tioned.
And in the ca&s;e of Baillie and Wat&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 27. and Aug. 7. 1714.</NOTE> where this
objection had been &s;tarted, the Lord Advocate in his infor|mation
&s;ays, &startq;as to the exacting of quarters without pay|ing
therefor, the pur&s;uer does not pretend that this is &s;or|ning;

admit a certain latitude in the way of charging the

is to be made out. On the other part, to libel &s;orning quite
at large, without any &s;pecification of particulars, in the &s;ame

unwarrantable; &s;ince there is not in the one as in the

account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 27. and Aug. 7. 1714.</NOTE> this freedom was in the ca&s;e of Wat&s;on and Baillie
refu&s;ed to be allowed; and the charge of &s;orning found ir|relevant
and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for that very rea&s;on<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;And the Lords find, that the &s;aid libel, not &s;pecifying any particular fact of &s;orning, is in that part thereof not relevant, and therefore repel the &s;ame.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>III. ANOTHER &s;ort of violence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exacting of Blackmail.</NOTE> or felonious con&s;traint,
which often went hand in hand with &s;orning, was the ex|acting
of what was called blackmail, &startq;<HI>firma nigra.</HI>&endq;
This was a &s;ort of ran&s;om money, which was given to pro|tect
the payer, his goods and effects, from theft and depre|dation;
and is &s;aid to have been &s;o denominated, in oppo&s;i|tion
to &startq;<HI>alba &s;irma,</HI>&endq; or, &startq;<HI>&s;ilver mail,</HI>&endq; as being often paid
in copper and ba&s;e-money, by poor and helple&s;s people.
The thing it&s;elf, as well as the term, was well known, not
only in the highland parts of Scotland, but in the border coun|ties
of both kingdoms; where the weak on either &s;ide of the
border put them&s;elves under this &s;ort of a&s;&s;urance to the pow|erful
of the other, and &s;ometimes of their own. Being a plain
encouragement to rapine, and a great ob&s;tacle to the cour&s;e
of ju&s;tice, even the paying of it was by &s;tatute 1567, c. 21.
(which proceeded on a propo&s;ition of the border counties),
made a capital crime. But I have not met with any in|&s;tance
of death inflicted even on the <HI>taker,</HI> much le&s;s on the
payer, for that &s;ort of oppre&s;&s;ion &s;ingly. Along with other
enormities, nearly allied to it, and commonly practi&s;ed by
the &s;ame per&s;ons, it might go to make up the capital charge:

for the per&s;on's good behaviour in future, if the Judge
&s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e. The other is the act of the 4. Geo. I. c. 11.
which makes it lawful for a per&s;on, arrived at the age of
fifteen, to indent him&s;elf for tran&s;portation, and &s;ervice in
any of the American colonies, for the term of eight years;
the contract being &s;igned in the pre&s;ence, and with the ap|probation
of two Ju&s;tices of Peace for the place where it
is made.</P>
<P>V. I SHALL now clo&s;e this chapter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws again&s;t harbouring Va|gabonds.</NOTE> with a word or two
concerning the mi&s;demeanour of keeping a hou&s;e of harbour|age

<P><PB N="353" REF="354">
AGAINST this and other practices of the &s;ame pernicious
encouragement to the idle and worthle&s;s, we have many
&s;harp and &s;evere enactments, e&s;pecially relative to the High|lands
and borders; and &s;ome which, being made for loo&s;er
times, when both the height of the di&s;order, and the weak|ne&s;s
of Government, made recour&s;e be had to violent and
exce&s;&s;ive denunciations, might not now be thought proper,
(if indeed they ever were), to be put in execution. By one
in particular, the act 1567, c. 21. whoever intercommunes
with a thief within forty-eight hours before or after his
doing of a theft; or whoever &s;hall within that time give him
food, harbourage, or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, either in his going to or co|ming
from his theftuous deed, (and the act has not required
&s;pecial proof of the a&s;&s;i&s;ter's knowledge of the theftuous

this crime, there neither could nor needed to be as minute
and accurate a charge, as in the trial of the thief him&s;elf,
thus harboured and received, for any of the acts of theft there
mentioned. Upon &s;uch a dittay it is the u&s;e and habit, the
way of livelihood that is to be proved, as relative to a certain
cour&s;e and period of time; and the particular facts of re&s;et|ting

THE characteri&s;tic of a pirate, and that wherein he dif|fers
from a regular enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pirate is he who has no commi&s;|&s;ion from any State.</NOTE> is, that he has no licen&s;e or com|mi&s;&s;ion
of ho&s;tility from any acknowledged &s;tate or govern|ment,
(in which cla&s;s tho&s;e of Algiers and Tripoli have how|ever
at la&s;t come to rank); but acts predoniou&s;ly, and car|ries
on a private and indi&s;criminate war, purely of his own
authority, and upon no principle but his plea&s;ure. For even
between nations which are in a &s;tate of open war, and much
more between tho&s;e which have only cau&s;es of complaint
for denial of ju&s;tice to their &s;ubjects, or the like, there is no
permi&s;&s;ion of crui&s;ing and ho&s;tility to the private citizens
of either, again&s;t the other; in which cour&s;e there could be
no &s;ecurity for ob&s;ervance of the rules of war, nor again&s;t
any &s;ort of exce&s;s or irregularity. On the contrary, all &s;uch
adventures mu&s;t be carried on under warrant of proper li|cen&s;es

receive them to bring in all captures entire, and without
breaking bulk, for condemnation in cour&s;e of law, and di|&s;tribution
of the value according to the regulations for the

Su&s;&s;ex, and other Engli&s;h pirates, to the number of eight,
were in like manner capitally convicted before the Ju&s;tice,
on the 8th December 1610. The following are farther in|&s;tances
of conviction of piracy in the &s;ame Court: The

concurrent juri&s;diction of the Ju&s;tice Court and that of the

declares the High Admiral to be the King's Lieutenant

&s;everal of the pannels, they were in con&s;equence a&s;&s;oilzied.

II. THE plundering of &s;tranded ve&s;&s;els, chiefly differs
from piracy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plundering of wrecked Ve&s;&s;els.</NOTE> as it can only be committed on the &s;hores of
the kingdom; and is not the act of known freebooters,
who have betaken them&s;elves to robbery as a trade, but of
per&s;ons who are tempted by the unprotected &s;ituation, ge|nerally
&s;peaking, of the prize, and the pre&s;ent opportunity
of profit. Like piracy, it is however, an injurious act to the
intere&s;t of trade, and &s;hows a hardened and rapacious di&s;po|&s;ition
in the offender.</P>
<P>IN the advancement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old Law of Wrecks is ob|&s;olete.</NOTE> therefore, of policy and civilization,
the iniquity of the old <HI>law of wrecks</HI> has been gradually
done away; and many humane provi&s;ions been received
for the &s;uccour of the unfortunate owners. According to
the ordinance of Alexander II. entitled, <HI>de wrecto maris,</HI>
all wreck e&s;cheated to the King; but under this limitation,
(&s;imilar to that e&s;tabli&s;hed in England in the time of Hen|ry
I. and II.), that no ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be held a wreck, if
any living thing were found on board, <HI>&startq;&s;i illo inveniatur bo|mo,
canis, vel murilegus vivens</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Stat. Alex. II. c. 25.</NOTE> But even in this ca&s;e the
owner lo&s;t his property, if he failed to make his claim with|in
year and day. By &s;tatute 1429, c. 124. this rigour was
departed from, with re&s;pect to the ve&s;&s;els of tho&s;e countries
which do not u&s;e &startq;the law (as the act calls it) of broken
&s;chippes in their awin lande;&endq; and the &s;ame favour was
ordered to be &s;hown them here, &startq;as they keep to the &s;chippes
of this land broken with them.&endq; But, though not expre&s;s|ly
altered by any later &s;tatute, this political provi&s;ion has
effectually been abrogated by the cu&s;tom and deci&s;ions of
modern times; which &s;u&s;tain the claim of the owners, of any
<PB N="367" REF="368">
country, without regard to the lap&s;e of year and day, and
whether any living thing be found on board or not.</P>
<P>ALL pretence of right in the fir&s;t occupier of &s;tranded
goods is thus excluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plundering of Wrecks is not a capital Crime.</NOTE> (and indeed it was &s;o under the old law
of e&s;cheat to the King), even in the ca&s;e of an ab&s;olute and
proper wreck. It is true, the plunderer cannot be pro|&s;ecuted
as a thief, by rea&s;on of the open and unprotec|ted
&s;tate in which he finds the &s;poil; yet &s;till in &s;eizing and
detaining that which is the right of another, he is guilty of
a wrong and di&s;hone&s;ty, &s;uch as is cogni&s;able in a criminal
Court, and may be puni&s;hed arbitrarily, according to the de|gree
of the fault. It appears that in England, the common
law no farther accommodated the owners of the &s;hip or
cargo, than by granting a commi&s;&s;ion at their reque&s;t, to in|quire
concerning the detainers of their property, and com|pel
them to make re&s;titution<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone, vol. i. p. 283.</NOTE>. To enlarge, therefore, this
very feeble protection, the Legi&s;lature interpo&s;ed with a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of &s;tatutes; 12th Anne, &s;tat. 2. c. 18.; 4th Geo. I.
c. 12.; 26th Geo. II. c. 19. in virtue of which, all the high|er
offences of this &s;ort are rai&s;ed to the rank of felony
without benefit of clergy. But, by expre&s;s provi&s;ion of
the la&s;t of the&s;e &s;tatutes, it does not extend to Scotland;
and the &s;ame has been found, (though in a que&s;tion only
as to other parts of their enactment); re&s;pecting the
two former; fir&s;t by the Judge-Admiral, in the ca&s;e of Sa|muel
Lampro in 1751, and afterwards by the Court of Ju|&s;ticiary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 14. 1784.</NOTE>
in the ca&s;e of Maciver and Macallum. Thus, there
does not &s;eem to be any authority with us in Scotland, for
puni&s;hing the depredator of <HI>wrecks</HI> with death, how great
&s;oever the exce&s;s to which he has gone.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="369">

ma&s;terful theft, to invade and pillage it, not with&s;tanding
their re&s;i&s;tance, or in their &s;ight, or when anywi&s;e under
their protection, as in any other ca&s;e of property that is
forced from the lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. For, from the nature of
the &s;ituation, any per&s;on on board who &s;urvives the calami|ty,

&s;hip and cargo, is con&s;tituted keeper thereof, for behoof
of all concerned; and not only has right, but is in duty bound
to take all the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures, in this their common
misfortune, towards the protection of their intere&s;t. Ac|cordingly,
in our older practice, &s;o much was this view ta|ken

offenders were judged and executed as pirates; which in ef|fect
they are as to the particular in&s;tance, though not as to
the habit or trade of the men. This appears from the ca&s;e
of John Macrorie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 2. 1625.</NOTE> and eleven others, who had &s;entence of
death, as pirates, for coming in boats and invading and plun|dering
a Flemi&s;h ve&s;&s;el, (be&s;ide killing &s;everal of the crew),

perhaps inaccurate, as far as related to the form of the

more &s;evere judgment than their offence de&s;erved, and would
have received, if it had been pro&s;ecuted in the competent

This tre&s;pa&s;s, which, in whatever &s;hape committed, ex|po&s;es
the offender to pecuniary penalties and forfeiture of the
goods, has, in the higher and more audacious modes of it, been
found nece&s;&s;ary to be repre&s;&s;ed with cha&s;ti&s;ement of a higher

both as to the puni&s;hment and the de&s;cription of the
crime, in proportion to the growing temptation and greater
frequency of &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, through the increa&s;e of the

though favoured by the words of the act, this con&s;truction
&s;eems to be liable to very weighty objections; not only on

<P>LAST of all; it is to be remembered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;ault of a Re|venue-officer is Crime at Com|mon law.</NOTE> that when any branch

commit the trial of &s;uch a&s;&s;aults to the Court of Ex|chequer:

only to the civil offences, puni&s;hable with pecuniary penalties:

<P>THERE is another crime again&s;t public trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXV.</NOTE> which
will require a particular examination, that of U&s;u|ry;
which is the &s;tipulating or exacting of an unlawful re|turn,
or rate of intere&s;t, upon the loan of money. For with
re&s;pect to this commodity, contrary to the rule which is ob|&s;erved
in other ca&s;es, it has not been thought proper to leave
men at freedom to &s;ix the terms of their contract as they
plea&s;e; but to regulate the conditions of their tran&s;action by
public authority, and &s;et a bounds to the profit of the creditor.
A provi&s;ion of this &s;ort at once an&s;wers the double purpo&s;e
of protecting the needy borrower from oppre&s;&s;ion; and of
guarding the greedy and uncon&s;cientious lender again&s;t the
temptation of a high premium, which might induce him to
tru&s;t his money in the hands of ra&s;h and vi&s;ionary adven|turers,
who ought not to be encouraged.</P>
<P>UPON this head we have &s;undry enactments of the Scotti&s;h
Legi&s;lature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes again&s;t U&s;ury.</NOTE> of which the&s;e are the mo&s;t noted; the act 1594,
<PB N="383" REF="384">
c. 222.; 1596, c. 251.; and 1621, c. 28.<NOTE PLACE="marg">USURY.</NOTE> But the chief law
which now &s;erves to regulate either the de&s;cription or the
puni&s;hment of u&s;ury, is the &s;tatute 12th of Anne, c. 16.
which reduces the rate of intere&s;t to 5 <HI>per cent.;</HI> and which
farther contains two di&s;tinct and independent provi&s;ions, re|&s;pecting
the infringement of that direction.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is in the&s;e words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute 12th Anue, c. 16. as to u&s;urious Sti|pulations.</NOTE> &startq;That all bonds, contracts,
and a&s;&s;urances what&s;oever, made after the time afore&s;aid,
for payment of any principal or money to be lent, or co|venanted
to be performed upon or for any u&s;ury, where|upon
or whereby there &s;hall be re&s;erved or taken above
the rate of L. 5 in the hundred, as afore&s;aid, &s;hall be ut|terly void.&endq;
In terms of this clau&s;e, the bond or con|tract
is vitiated by the bare &s;tipulation of an u&s;urious profit;
though nothing have been paid or received in pur&s;uance of
the engagement. Al&s;o, it has been holden, that under the&s;e
words, &startq;<HI>whereupon or whereby,</HI>&endq; employed in the act, the
nullity equally attaches to two different &s;ituations of the
contract. The word <HI>whereupon,</HI> is under&s;tood to relate to the
ca&s;e of an open and direct &s;tipulation, (which will not often
be in&s;erted), of an u&s;urious rate of intere&s;t, &s;uch as &s;ix or
&s;even <HI>per cent.</HI> upon the &s;um written in the contract; and
the word <HI>whereby,</HI> relates to that of a fal&s;e and &s;imulate
contrivance, whereby, in effect, though not upon the face
of the contract, the like &s;tipulation is made. As if upon a
loan of L. 100, a bond is taken for L. 120, with intere&s;t for
that &s;um at 5 <HI>per cent.;</HI> which is in truth a &s;tipulation of 6 <HI>per|cent.</HI>
upon the &s;um which has actually been advanced: or if
at executing a bond for L. 100, payable at the di&s;tance of a
year, L. 5 is agreed to be retained as a year's intere&s;t; for
in this way, the bond relates a fal&s;ehood, and the real bar|gain
<PB N="384" REF="385">
gain is equal to a &s;tipulation of L. 5, for the u&s;e of L. 95 for
a year.</P>
<P>FARTHER;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute reaches all indirect De|vices.</NOTE> in the con&s;truction of this &s;tatute, it is held to
be immaterial, whether the principal and u&s;urious intere&s;t
are &s;ecured by the &s;ame, or by different deeds<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hawkin's, b. 1. c. 82. No. 21.</NOTE>; if they be
plain parts and confirmations of one corrupt bargain and
agreement. And &s;o it had been held in que&s;tions al&s;o under
the Scotti&s;h &s;tatutes. For one of the articles found relevant
again&s;t William Sommerville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 18. 1667.</NOTE> and on which he was convic|ted,
and &s;uffered e&s;cheat of moveables, (having, however,
received the u&s;urious profit), was a charge of lending 5000
merks on wad&s;et, and taking a &s;eparate bond of annual pen|&s;ion
for 200 merks, &s;o as to rai&s;e the intere&s;t to 10 <HI>per cent.</HI>
Neither will it make any difference in favour of the lender,
that the contract is lawful in its &s;tipulations of money; if it
a&s;&s;ure him over and above of the furni&s;hing of any other
thing or commodity, &s;uch as grain, meal, grazing of cattle,
or the like, which has a known and &s;ub&s;tantial value. Nay,
it will not even &s;ave the lender, though, as upon the face of
the contract, the &s;tipulation &s;hould not be of intere&s;t, but in
a quite different &s;hape; if it be truly intended in defraud of
the law. As if the debtor, in the bond which he gives for
the money, or in another deed of the &s;ame date, and rela|tive
to it, lets the creditor a hou&s;e for a rent corre&s;ponding
to the lawful intere&s;t of the &s;um lent, but much lower than
the ju&s;t and accu&s;tomed rent of that tenement; and authori&s;es
him to retain the rent in payment of the intere&s;t of his loan.
This is the opinion of Hawkin's on the act of Anne<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">B. 1. c. 82. No. 22.</NOTE> and
to the &s;ame effect, our Judges had decided in the ca&s;e of
<PB N="385" REF="386">
Hugh Craig, of the 24th November 1668. This article,
among others, was there found relevant; that in the bond
for the loan, and in order to cover the u&s;ury, the lender
had taken a tack of two booths or &s;hops from his debtor, at
the rent of L. 100 Scots, to be annually retained in pay|ment
of the intere&s;t, and with a clau&s;e of relief from all
&s;tents and public burdens; which &s;hops had always rented
at L. 153 Scots, and were &s;ub&s;et by the pannel at eight &s;core
pounds<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;The Ju&s;tices finds the defence and duply relevantly proponed again&s;t the dittay, and repels the an&s;wers made thereto; but finds if it was communed betwixt the parties, the time of the &s;etting of the tack, that con&s;idering that the two booths did formerly pay a greater duty nor the annualrent of the mo|ney, and that <HI>intuitu</HI> and &s;atisfaction of more annualrent nor is allowed by the law, the tack was &s;et, relevant, and ordains the &s;ame to pa&s;s to the knowledge of an a&s;&s;ize.&endq;</NOTE>.

ca&s;e is thus far erroneous, that the tack was let for &s;ecurity
of the principal &s;um as well as intere&s;t, and bore a clau&s;e
for imputation of the creditor's receipts again&s;t both. In|deed
&s;everal devices of this &s;ort, as by letting back-tacks of
wad&s;et lands for high duties, or by &s;imulate &s;ales of victual,
under high penalties in ca&s;e of failure to deliver at a certain
day, are de&s;cribed and &s;pecially forbidden in the Scots act,
1597, c. 251.; which, as far as it is not contradictory of the
&s;tatute of Anne, but in the like &s;train with it, and calcula|ted
for the &s;ame end, &s;till continues to be in force; and af|fords
an argument towards expounding of the latter, in its
application to the Scotti&s;h practice.</P>

THE other provi&s;ion of the act of Anne, was made to meet
the ca&s;e of an in&s;trument of debt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute of Anne, as to Payment of u&s;urious Intere&s;t.</NOTE> in it&s;elf fair and lawful,
but followed with the actual taking and receiving of an
u&s;urious profit, in virtue of &s;ome &s;eparate and later &s;ettle|ment,
or upon a verbal or under&s;tood agreement. The con|&s;equence
is declared thus: &startq;And that all and every per&s;on

by way of means of any corrupt bargain, loan, exchange,
cherizance, &s;hift, or intere&s;t of any wares, merchandizes, or
other thing or things what&s;oever, or by any deceitful way
or means, or by any covin, engine, or deceitful conveyance,
for the forbearing or giving day of payment for one
whole year, of and for their money or other thing, above
the &s;um of five pounds for the forbearing of one hundred
pounds for a year, and &s;o after that rate for a greater and
le&s;&s;er &s;um, or for a longer or &s;horter term, &s;hall forfeit
and lo&s;e for every &s;uch offence the treble value of the
monies, wares, merchandizes, and other things &s;o lent,
bargained, exchanged or &s;hifted.&endq; If therefore a bond

of 6 <HI>per cent.</HI> the treble penalties are due; but the bond is a
ground of action neverthele&s;s, and the creditor &s;hall equal|ly
have decree for the contents, as the King for the &s;tatu|tory
penalties<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 1. c. 82. No. 12.</NOTE>. In the ca&s;e of Cohoun and Dun, decided in

which u&s;urious profits had been taken. If, on the contrary,
an unlawful rate of intere&s;t has been &s;tipulated in the in&s;tru|ment,

<P>IF,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Receipt of u&s;urious Intere&s;t not in Money.</NOTE> in the con&s;truction of this &s;ort of charge, we &s;hall fol|low

This was held to be law in the &s;aid ca&s;e of James Harper;
where another of the charges which were remitted to the
<PB N="388" REF="389">

from the debtor, as a con&s;ideration, over the intere&s;t, for con|tinuing
the loan of the money. To make out a charge in
either of the&s;e kinds, it is, however, nece&s;&s;ary, that the thing
be rendered upon &s;ome agreement of the parties, either ex|pre&s;s
or under&s;tood; and not in the way of free offering or gra|tuity
on the part of the debtor. Whether for want of evi|dence

and William&s;on were acquitted.</P>
<P>How broad &s;oever this con&s;truction of the &s;tatutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alternative Sti|pulations of far|ther Intere&s;t.</NOTE> it can|not
reach tho&s;e &s;tipulations, which are not direct for pay|ment
of &s;ome unlawful profit, ab&s;olutely, in name of inte|re&s;t;
but of an alternative or provi&s;ional nature, for &s;ome ad|ditional
or commuted con&s;ideration, in ca&s;e the lawful in|tere&s;t
&s;hall not be punctually rendered. As, if upon an an|nualrent
of grain, the creditor &s;hall &s;tipulate a certain high
commuted price, for every boll that &s;hall not be delivered
at a certain day; or, as in our ordinary bonds of borrowed
money, which bear <HI>a termly failzie,</HI> (as it is called,) or &s;tipu|lation
of a certain &s;um upon failure of punctual payment of
each term's intere&s;t. In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, the debtor
has it in his power to avoid the higher obligation by due
performance of the lower; and the &s;tipulation is not pro|perly
of intere&s;t for the u&s;e of the &s;um, but of damages or
co&s;ts for failure to pay the intere&s;t; and which if exce&s;&s;ive or
uncon&s;cionable may be &s;ubject to retrenchment by the Judge.
The advantage in &s;uch a ca&s;e ari&s;es from the debtor's negli|gence,

<P>ANOTHER cla&s;s of bargains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bargains of Ha|zard are not u|&s;urious.</NOTE> to which, according to the cour&s;e

upon bottomry, or at <HI>re&s;pondentia</HI> or the like, which depend
on uncertain events, as to the payment of both principal and

of &s;uch a tran&s;action as a grant of annuity upon lives,
where the &s;tock is &s;unk and given away, as the price of an

is true of all tho&s;e modes of bargain, by which a pre&s;ent
&s;um is given for return of another &s;um or &s;ums in a certain

As uncon&s;cionable, and in &s;ome in&s;tances as immo|ral
and of evil example, &s;uch bargains may be liable to be
&s;et a&s;ide; but they are beyond the reach of the law of u&s;ury,
not being loans for &s;tated profit, but pure wagers or bar|gains
of chance, whereof the advantage may turn to either

<P>WITH re&s;pect to a bargain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bargains where the Intere&s;t is at Hazard.</NOTE> by which the intere&s;t only,
and not the principal &s;um is at hazard,&mdash;it &s;eems to be the
rule of the law of England, that this does not hinder the
high rate of intere&s;t to be u&s;urious. But in this their prac|tice
is at variance with the known tenor of our cu&s;tom re|&s;pecting
proper wad&s;ets; according to which it has always
been lawful for the creditor to receive a pledge of land more
than equivalent, in common years, to the intere&s;t of his mo|ney;
provided he be &s;ubject to the hazard of the fruits and
rents of the tenement impledged, and thus in bad years, or
by the failure of tenants or otherwi&s;e, run the ri&s;k of lo&s;ing
his intere&s;t. The provi&s;ion of the &s;tatute 1661, c. 62. con|cerning
u&s;urious wad&s;ets, is limited, accordingly, to the op|po&s;ite
ca&s;e, of the wad&s;etter being relieved of all &s;uch ha|zard.
Nor does the act 1597, c. 251. contain any general
declaration to the contrary; but only a &s;pecial provi&s;ion for
the ca&s;e of a back-tack of the wad&s;et lands, given at a rent ex|ceeding
the intere&s;t of the debt<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Mackenzie, Tit. U&s;ury, No. 4. Dict. Deci&s;. vol. ii. <HI>voce</HI> U&s;ury.</NOTE>. In regard to annualrents
of grain, which, by the variation of the price of that com|modity,
might give ri&s;e to que&s;tions of this kind; and had pro|bably

been made the cloak of uncon&s;cionable bargains,
&s;uch as could not be remedied at common law, (by rea&s;on
that the lender ran the ri&s;k of the fall of the price below his
intere&s;t); the &s;tatute la&s;t mentioned, made provi&s;ion for re|ducing
them &startq;to &s;ik conformity of price as &s;hall an&s;wer to

had paid the victual contained in the &s;aid infeftments.&endq;
Now, though this act will no longer apply in its own preci&s;e
terms; yet upon the principle of it, which &s;eems in it&s;elf
to be ju&s;t, and calculated, like the act of Anne, for hinder|ing
all receipt of undue profit, &startq;directly or indirectly;&endq; it
may &s;eem that the creditor who receives a much greater
quantity of grain than by the fiars of the year corre&s;ponds
to the lawful rate of intere&s;t, and who wilfully refu&s;es to
let his bargain be reformed according to that &s;tandard, &s;hall
be liable to the charge of u&s;ury. It is true, that in the ca&s;e
of Skene of Hallyards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 22. 1672.</NOTE> &s;uch a charge was found irrelevant;
but this probably, (for the interlocutor does not a&s;&s;ign
any rea&s;on), becau&s;e the advantage libelled was neither
clear nor con&s;iderable, nor imputable, in the whole circum|&s;tances
of the ca&s;e, to a purpo&s;e of defrauding the law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">If, as Mackenzie &s;eems to think, (No. 4. <HI>tit. U&s;ury</HI>), it proceeded on the notion that the act 1597, c. 251. did not abrogate the prior &s;tatute 1594, c. 122: which allows an <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> &s;tipulation of five bolls of victual for each L. 100, the propriety of it may be que&s;tioned. For the act 1597, appears to be a <HI>general</HI> &s;tatute, for reducing all bargains of annualrent of victual, to conformity with the lawful rate of intere&s;t. This was a &s;eparate charge from that mentioned in p. 389.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is another article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Payment of In|tere&s;t before|hand</NOTE> in which al&s;o our cu&s;tom &s;eems

rules mu&s;t &s;till be ob&s;erved, when the occa&s;ion of applying
them &s;hall happen. This is the payment of intere&s;t before|hand.
To a certain extent at lea&s;t, this practice is pro|vided
again&s;t by the act 1621, c. 28.; which ordains, &startq;That

<P>THE retention of a year's intere&s;t out of the principal
loan of 2500 merks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 1. 1666.</NOTE> was, accordingly, one of the articles of
charge which were found relevant in the ca&s;e of James Har|per.
But, under authority of the la&s;t words of the &s;tatute, the
penalties of u&s;ury have even been applied to the receiving of
intere&s;t at any period after the loan, for a term not yet expi|red.
Thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11. 1666.</NOTE> John Purdie was convicted of u&s;ury upon the
evidence of two receipts, one of the 18th July 1663, for the

was an aggravated ca&s;e: But it may &s;eem doubtful whe|ther
the &s;imple taking of intere&s;t before arrival of the
term, on a &s;um which has really been advanced, is either
properly u&s;urious in it&s;elf, or within the purview of the &s;ta|tute
1621; which is ambiguou&s;ly worded, and perhaps has
only relation to the &s;tronger ca&s;e therein &s;pecially &s;et forth,
of the retention of the intere&s;t out of the principal &s;um,
at the time of the loan. Notice may be taken of the later
ca&s;e of Cleland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 15. 1741, C. Home.</NOTE> where the Court of Se&s;&s;ion found that a re|ceipt
of intere&s;t down to Lammas, and dated in the pre|ceding
month of January, was no &s;ufficient evidence of u&s;ury,
to annul a bond for a loan of money.</P>
<P>BUT granting that the law has not been &s;trained in this
con&s;truction;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Receipt of In|tere&s;t before|hand.</NOTE> it does not follow, nor is there any precedent
for it, that the &s;tatute, equivocally worded as it is, &s;hall be
interpreted by the very letter; &s;o as to hinder the receiving
of intere&s;t before the term of payment written in the bond,
though it be rendered in proportion only to the time du|ring
which the creditor has had the u&s;e of the money, whe|ther
this be half a year, or a quarter of a year, or even a
&s;horter period. The creditor has indeed an advantage in the
more prompt payment; yet &s;till he receives from this debtor
only the lawful intere&s;t for the time that the money has re|mained
<PB N="394" REF="395">
with him. An exception mu&s;t al&s;o be admitted of
the tran&s;actions of bankers; &s;ome of which, and the mo&s;t
u&s;eful and frequent of any, &s;uch as the di&s;counting of bills,
might &s;eem to fall under the &s;anction of this &s;tatute, if rigo|rou&s;ly
con&s;trued.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to all the authorities in our law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stipulation of Intere&s;t upon Intere&s;t is un|lawful.</NOTE> which in this
article is grounded on the Civil, it is al&s;o an unlawful and
fruitle&s;s covenant, to bargain for intere&s;t upon intere&s;t<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mackenzie, tit. U&s;ury, No. 5.; Stair, p. 139.; Bankt. vol. i. p. 440. No. 14.</NOTE>: but
this is only true according to a di&s;tinction. The creditor
is not forbidden annually to take a new document for the
actual arrear of intere&s;t, and thus convert it into a &s;tock,
which &s;hall bear intere&s;t in time to come. For after this cour&s;e,
the debtor's attention is rou&s;ed to the increa&s;e of the burden
upon him; and if he wittingly choo&s;e to retain the intere&s;t
upon the&s;e terms, there is no good rea&s;on why it may not be
lent to him, equally as to any other per&s;on<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This matter is debated in the ca&s;e of James Daes, Nov. 22. 1664; but the interlocutor and proceedings are perplexed and ob&s;cure.</NOTE>. But if the
arrear is &s;uffered &s;ilently to run on for a &s;eries of years,
and, at &s;ettlement of accounts, a charge is made again&s;t the
debtor, upon the principle of compound intere&s;t; this is
an oppre&s;&s;ive exaction to that per&s;on, who, uncon&s;cious of
the growing evil, had all the while neglected to keep down
the claim. The law will not, therefore, &s;upport the creditor
in his demand of a &s;ettlement on that ground; nor will it
give effect to a previous paction for compound intere&s;t,
which would be a plain temptation to the lender, always to
&s;tipulate in that form, and to forbear the demanding of the
intere&s;t as it falls due: not to mention that the debtor,
not being pu&s;hed for payment, would be apt to forget
<PB N="395" REF="396">
or to undervalue the operation of &s;uch a covenant again&s;t
him.</P>
<P>BUT, though the paction or demand of compound intere&s;t,
be, for the&s;e equitable rea&s;ons, ineffectual in law; yet if
parties actually &s;ettle accounts on that footing, it is not
&s;o clear that the creditor is &s;ubject to the treble penalties,
as taking more than 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> on the &s;um lent. The ar|gument
again&s;t it is, that truly the additional profit is not
taken for forbearance of the original &s;um, but of the an|nual
profits, which ought to have been paid, and might
have been exacted, and have been gainful to the debtor by
remaining in his hands. And it happens in many in&s;tances,
that things which the law, for good rea&s;ons, will not
enforce, it yet holds for valid when done, and will not undo.
Certain it is, that I have found no in&s;tance of conviction,
nor even of interlocutor of relevancy, obtained upon &s;uch
grounds. It is at the &s;ame time clear, that if (as in the ca&s;e
of Cohoun and Dun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 12. 1790.</NOTE> where it was &s;o judged) the creditor
&s;hall accumulate the intere&s;t <HI>termly,</HI> and take a bill for the
amount; this bill is void, as being an a&s;&s;urance of u&s;urious
profits: for they are more than 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> for a year's
forbearance of the original loan. By the &s;ame rule, if he
take payment of &s;uch bill, the treble penalties al&s;o &s;hall be
due.</P>
<P>THE pains of law for u&s;ury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Law for U&s;ury.</NOTE> have in part been already
mentioned. They are, 1. by the act of Anne, the nul|lity
of the bond or contract, where it contains, directly
or indirectly, any u&s;urious &s;tipulation. By the act 1594,
c. 222. the debtor was to be di&s;charged of his obligation,
if he revealed the u&s;ury; and if another revealed it, the
<PB N="396" REF="397">
claim of debt was to accrue to the revealer. By the act 1597,
c. 251. this was altered for a confi&s;cation of the &s;um, and or|dinary
intere&s;t, in all ca&s;es, to the King; along with re&s;titu|tion
of the u&s;urious profits to the debtor, if he concur|red
in the pro&s;ecution. But both the&s;e regulations &s;eem
to be &s;uper&s;eded by the act of Anne, which introduces
an ab&s;olute nullity of the obligation; &s;uch as is not only
good again&s;t the creditor and his heirs, but even again&s;t his
onerous a&s;&s;ignees, who were not affected by the Scotti&s;h
&s;tatutes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Kilk. Deci&s;. <HI>v.</HI> U&s;ury, p. 591. No. 1.</NOTE>. 2. By the act of Anne, in ca&s;e, of u&s;urious profit
being received, action lies for treble the amount of the &s;um
lent or contracted on; whereof one half goes to the party,
what&s;oever, pro&s;ecutor, and the other to the King, who may
&s;ue for the&s;e penalties without the debtor's concurrence; and
who&s;e &s;uit &s;eems to be &s;ubject to no other limitation with
re&s;pect to the competent time for bringing it, than according
to the common rules of the law of Scotland<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">December 2. 1766, Mackechnie again&s;t Wallace; January 19. 1775, James Wil&s;on again&s;t James Jack&s;on. Wallace's Deci&s;ions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3. To the&s;e pecuniary penalties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corporal Pains; if &s;till compe|tent.</NOTE> the act 1597, c. 251. &s;uper|adds
the confi&s;cation of moveables, and other puni&s;hments
in the per&s;on. I do not, however, find that this di&s;cretion|ary
power of inflicting corporal puni&s;hment has in any in|&s;tance
been made u&s;e of; although in the ca&s;e of William
Sommerville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 25. 1667. Nov. 23. 1668.</NOTE> and in that of Hugh Roxburgh, after decla|ring
the e&s;cheat of goods, the &s;entence ordains the pannel to
find caution for his appearance before the Court or Privy
Council &startq;whenever he &s;hall be called, to underlie &s;uch other
<PB N="397" REF="398">
&startq;puni&s;hment and cen&s;ure, as they &s;hall think &s;it.&endq; And
indeed, even as to the e&s;cheat of moveables, and much more
as to any farther &s;everity, it may &s;eem to de&s;erve con&s;ide|ration
whether it be not in effect taken away by the act of
Anne; which e&s;tabli&s;hes the pre&s;ent rate of intere&s;t, and pre|&s;cribes
the penalties of u&s;ury for both kingdoms, as relative
to this rate, in like manner as the act 1597 did with relation
to the rate of 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> at that time allowed. If &s;till com|petent,
the confi&s;cation and other pains can only be inflicted
in the Court of Ju&s;ticiary, to which the act 1597 remits the
cogni&s;ance of the proper criminal charge; whereas not only
may the nullity of the contract be declared, in the way of
either action or exception, in any court where the writing is
put in &s;uit; but even the treble penalties may be decreed by
any Judge-Ordinary, and without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Jury;
this being a pure pecuniary action. The&s;e points were &s;et|tled
in the ca&s;e of Wil&s;on and Jack&s;on above referred to.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 19. 1775.</NOTE>
4. By the act of Anne, any &s;crivener, broker, &s;olicitor, or
driver of bargains, who for procuring the loan or forbear|ance
of L. 100 &s;hall take above 5 s. is made liable to a fine
of L. 20, and &s;ix months impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>THE competent evidence of u&s;ury has not been left
to the cour&s;e of common law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of u&s;ing Oath of Party.</NOTE> but is the &s;ubject of &s;pe|cial
provi&s;ions; which being equivocally penned, have
given ri&s;e to controver&s;y, and fluctuation of practice.
The direction given in the &s;tatute 1597, was, that it
&s;hould &startq;be tried by the <HI>aith of party,</HI> and all uther law|ful
probation, <HI>conjoyned therewith,</HI> competent of the law.&endq;
Under the&s;e words, a doubt had ari&s;en concerning the
oath which was meant to be u&s;ed; whether it were the
oath of the party debtor, and payer of the unlawful in|tere&s;t,
<PB N="398" REF="399">
or of the party receiver and pannel. This contro|ver&s;y
was &s;ettled by the act 1600, c. 7. which allows the li|bel
to be proved, &startq;by writte or aith of party <HI>receaver</HI> of the
&s;aid unlawful profite, <HI>and</HI> be the witne&s;&s;es <HI>in&s;ert in the &s;aid
&s;ecurity</HI> made for the &s;aid &s;ummes.&endq; In the ca&s;e, according|ly,
of Robert Lauder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 4. 1668.</NOTE> after interlocutor &s;u&s;taining the defences
again&s;t the libel as laid, reference was made <HI>&s;impliciter</HI> to
the oath of the pannel, that he had received more than the
lawful intere&s;t; which, with the pannel's con&s;ent, was found
relevant; and on &s;wearing in his own favour he was a&s;&s;oil|zied.
In the ca&s;e too of James Wil&s;on<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;In &s;upplement of the depo&s;ition of the witne&s;&s;es, and remanent probation, the Ju&s;tices, with con&s;ent of the pannel, and his procurators, ordaynes the &s;aid James Wil&s;one's oath to be taken.&endq;</NOTE>, but only with his
own con&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 11. 1667.</NOTE> his oath was allowed to be taken, along with,
and in &s;upplement of other probation. He &s;wore <HI>negative,</HI> and
was a&s;&s;oilzied. Whether, without his con&s;ent, his oath
could have been re&s;orted to in this &s;upplementary way, and
not as deci&s;ive of the cau&s;e, I &s;hall not affirm. On the one
hand, this &s;ort of reference to the oath of party is contrary
to the ordinary rule of law, even for civil intere&s;ts and
actions; and on the other, the words of both &s;tatutes 1597
and 1600, give a colour at lea&s;t to argue, that the Legi&s;la|ture
intended to permit it. But the&s;e laws are both of them
very incorrectly drawn; and I have not ob&s;erved, that in
any in&s;tance the pro&s;ecutor for u&s;ury has advanced &s;uch a
preten&s;ion. Indeed, if that plea be good on his &s;ide; the
words of both &s;tatutes give the pannel equal countenance
in this preten&s;ion, (which, however, does not &s;eem to have
been urged on any occa&s;ion), that his oath is in every in&s;tance
<PB N="399" REF="400">
a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> part of the proof, without which he cannot be
convicted.</P>
<P>IN regard to the evidence of witne&s;&s;es;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof by Wit|ne&s;&s;es; who are competent.</NOTE> the &s;aid &s;tatute 1600,
while it &s;olved one doubt, gave ri&s;e by its expre&s;&s;ions to ano|ther,
namely, whether this &s;ort of proof were not confined to
the witne&s;&s;es in&s;erted in the deed. But this would be &s;uch a
limitation of the proce&s;s, as truly to prevent conviction, ex|cept
upon very rare occa&s;ions. And as the act 1600 was in|tended
in the main to do away the ambiguity of the former
law, with re&s;pect to the oath of party; &s;o in the brief men|tion
which it makes of the in&s;trumentary witne&s;&s;es, as al&s;o
competent to give evidence, it &s;eems more probable, that
the Legi&s;lature intended to obviate the doubts which might
ari&s;e concerning the admi&s;&s;ibility of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who&s;e
evidence upon the matter of u&s;ury may often be contra|dictory
to, and tend to &s;et a&s;ide the written contract which
they have &s;ub&s;cribed. Accordingly, as appears from the
judgment in the ca&s;e of Harper<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;The Ju&s;tice depute, notwith&s;tanding of the defence, ordains the dittay to be put to the knowledge of an a&s;&s;ize, and to be proven by witne&s;&s;es, albeit not in&s;ert in the writ.&endq;</NOTE>, relative to a bribe of
L.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 1. 1666.</NOTE> 100 for the loan of the money; it was at that time
a &s;ettled point, that matters extrin&s;ic to the bond or con|tract
might be proved by any witne&s;&s;es what&s;oever. And in
the civil court the like judgment was given, with re&s;pect to
the payment of intere&s;t beforehand, in the ca&s;e of James Mit|chell
<HI>contra</HI> William Petrie;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 7. 1724, Kaimes.</NOTE> under provi&s;ion that the wit|ne&s;&s;es
were per&s;ons above exception. Now, the&s;e judgments
&s;eem to be truly deci&s;ive of the general point: For the
<PB N="400" REF="401">
&s;tatute has not di&s;tingui&s;hed between one de&s;cription of ca&s;es
and another.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion may likewi&s;e be &s;tated concerning the
debtor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is the debtor a habile Witne&s;s.</NOTE> whether he is a competent witne&s;s to prove this of|fence,
committed indeed again&s;t him, but of which he is al|&s;o
in &s;ome mea&s;ure him&s;elf participant. Now, with re&s;pect
to him, there &s;eems to be room for a di&s;tinction. If the
debtor is pur&s;uing, either to declare the nullity of his con|tract,
or to recover the treble penalties; certainly he can|not
at the &s;ame time be a witne&s;s in his own cau&s;e, and for
his own behoof. Farther, even though the pro&s;ecution be
at in&s;tance of the King; yet &s;till if the claim of debt be
&s;tanding, this &s;eems to be &s;uch a &s;ituation in which the
debtor cannot ju&s;tly be admitted to give evidence; by rea&s;on
of the &s;trong and immediate intere&s;t on his part, which
ari&s;es, as the law now is, from the ab&s;olute nullity of the
contract, which en&s;ues upon conviction. Agreeably to this
view; under the old laws 1594 and 1597, by which the
debtor's intere&s;t in the conviction depended on the circum|&s;tance
of his being informer of the King's Advocate, and
concurring in the reduction of the contract, the practice was
only to admit his te&s;timony, if he would purge him&s;elf up|on
oath of the&s;e grounds of &s;u&s;picion. Thus, in the trial of
Rutherford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 29. 1664.</NOTE> Daes and others, for &s;eparate acts of u&s;ury,
John Learmonth, and Thomas Kincaid, the debtors, were
admitted witne&s;&s;es <HI>cum nota;</HI> they purging them&s;elves of ha|ving
been informers of tho&s;e particular charges, and renoun|cing
all benefit they might have by the proce&s;s. In the ca&s;e,
too,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 11. 1667.</NOTE> of James Wil&s;on, which Mackenzie has noted as a judg|ment
on the other &s;ide, the procedure &s;eems truly to have
been to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. For though it be true, that the
<PB N="401" REF="402">
interlocutor of Court, finds the objection relevant to
George Home of Graden the debtor, offered as a witne&s;s to
prove the libel; yet there is this entry in the record imme|diately
under it: &startq;Thereafter George Home of Graden
being &s;worn, deponit that he had given information of this
pur&s;uit to the pur&s;uer.&endq; In like manner, Alexander Home,
the next witne&s;s, being objected to for the &s;ame rea&s;on, he is
&s;worn upon it; and having confe&s;&s;ed that he is informer, he is
no farther examined: &s;o that in both in&s;tances the judgment
was qualified by relation to the debtor's intere&s;t in the pro&s;e|cution<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mackenzie farther makes mention of the ca&s;e of Sommerville as a prece|dent for admitting the debtor's te&s;timony. But it does not &s;eem to be in point to this que&s;tion; for in that ca&s;e Stewart of Hill&s;ide, the debtor, only de|poned re&s;pecting a particular fact or defence which the <HI>pannel</HI> offered to prove in that way. And it was not till after Stewart had deponed <HI>negative</HI> on this de|fence, that the libel was remitted to an a&s;&s;ize, According to the practice of that time, if the defence had been proved by Stewart's depo&s;ition, the libel never would have gone to an a&s;&s;ize at all.</NOTE> Now, according to this principle, as applicable to
the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the law, by which the nullity of the a&s;|&s;urance
of debt is independent of all &s;uch con&s;iderations, the
debtor &s;eems with us, (as he is in England), to be liable to
an ab&s;olute objection; if the debt is &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. But if
the debt has been fully paid, in which ca&s;e the treble penalties
are due; and if the debtor will renounce the right which he
has under the act of Anne, to pur&s;ue for a moiety of tho&s;e
penalties, as one of the people; the objection &s;eems thus to be
done away, to the effect; at lea&s;t of admitting him <HI>cum nota.</HI></P>
<P>IT will be proper to &s;ay, before concluding, that owing to
the altered &s;ituation of the country, and the le&s;s hazard which
the debtor now runs of being oppre&s;&s;ed by the money-lend|er,
any criminal charge for this offence would probably meet
<PB N="402" REF="403">
with a more lenient con&s;truction than &s;eems to have been
u&s;ed in former times. The period in which chiefly the laws
again&s;t u&s;ury were put to execution, appears to have been
from 1663 to 1670. And in that &s;pace the pro&s;ecutions
were very numerous indeed: owing, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, to a gift
of the penalties and forfeitures in favour of the Earl of
Glencairn, who appears as pro&s;ecutor in all tho&s;e actions;
and who, in the view of con&s;training parties to compound
with him, (in which, to judge by the many de&s;erted diets
in the record, he was very &s;ucce&s;sful), had &s;et on foot
a di|ligent
inqui&s;ition concerning all offences on this kind. In|deed,
to &s;uch exce&s;s was his activity carried, that the Privy
council in the end interpo&s;ed to forbid all proce&s;s for
u&s;ury at
any private in&s;tance, without a &s;pecial warrant from them|&s;elves;
and for infringing this ordinance, a fine was inflict|ed
on one Mu&s;chet, on the 19th January 1674. There has
not, in the pre&s;ent century, been any in&s;tance of a libel for
u&s;ury rai&s;ed in the Supreme Criminal Court.</P>
<P>II. IN this chapter I may al&s;o take notice of the offence
of fraudulent bankruptcy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Fraudulent Bankrupcy.</NOTE> or the wilful cheating of credi|tors
by an in&s;olvent per&s;on, or one who conducts him&s;elf as
&s;uch; whether this be done by withdrawing his effects for
his own u&s;e and behoof, or for that of others, whom he is di&s;|po&s;ed
unduly to favour. By &s;tatute 1696, c. 5. this iniquity
&s;tands remitted to the cogni&s;ance of the Supreme Civil Court,
who are directed to declare the offender infamous; and are al&s;o
empowered to puni&s;h him &startq;by bani&s;hment or otherwi&s;e, death
excepted, as they &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e,&endq; according to the mea&s;ure
of his fault. The ordinary cour&s;e has been by &s;entence of
pillory: as in the ca&s;e of James Wauchope, February 4. 1757;
and of James and George Keltie, February 14. 1776. But
<PB N="403" REF="404">
in more aggravated ca&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FORESTAILING.</NOTE> &s;uch as that of George and Ro|bert

<P>III. I SHALL now clo&s;e the li&s;t of offences injurious to the
intere&s;t of trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Fore&s;talling and Regrating.</NOTE> with a few words upon fore&s;talling and re|grating.
The fir&s;t of the&s;e, as de&s;cribed in the &s;tatute 1592,
c. 150. (which is a literal tran&s;cript of the Engli&s;h &s;tat. 5.
and 6. Edward VI. c. 14.) is committed in the buying, or
contracting for any commodity that is on the way to mar|ket;
or the di&s;&s;uading any one who is on the way to mar|ket,
from carrying his commodity there; or the making
motion to enhance the prices in the market. By the &s;ame
&s;tatute, the per&s;on is to be held <HI>a regrator,</HI> who buys corn,
victual, fle&s;h, fi&s;h, or other <HI>vivres,</HI> in fair or market, and
&s;ells them again either in the &s;ame, or in any other fair or
market, within four miles thereof; or who, by buying, con|tract,
or promi&s;e, gets into his hand the corn growing in the
field. The puni&s;hment is, for the fir&s;t offence, a fine of
L. 40, and the finding of &s;urety to ab&s;tain for the future;
for the &s;econd, a fine of 100 merks; and for the third,
e&s;cheat of moveables. And to facilitate conviction, the &s;ta|tute
authori&s;es to &s;end the accu&s;ed to an a&s;&s;ize upon a gene|ral
charge of being <HI>habite and repute</HI> a common engro&s;&s;er or
regrator, without any more &s;pecial dittay. There are many
in&s;tances of the pro&s;ecution of fore&s;tallers and regrators; but
few convictions have been obtained; and of tho&s;e which are
<PB N="404" REF="405">
on record, &s;ome appear not to have been followed with any
&s;entence. On the 15th May 1588, Alexander and James Robert|&s;on
and Thomas Reid were convicted of fore&s;talling cattle and
&s;heep, and keeping it up to a dearth; and they were fined. On
the 9th June 1596, John Wil&s;on and Bernard Stuart, were con|victed
of fore&s;talling and regrating corn; but I cannot find that
any puni&s;hment en&s;ued. On the 12th of the &s;ame month, John
Ander&s;on, and others, were accu&s;ed as regrators, on the &s;ingle
ground of buying corn as merchants, in order to &s;ell it again;
which, according to the pro&s;ecutor's doctrine, was unlawful
for any but malt&s;ters and dealers in meal. The pannels an|&s;wered,
(and certainly with rea&s;on), that corn is a lawful
&s;ubject of merchandi&s;e, if the trade be not carried on by
fore&s;talling or regrating; and that otherwi&s;e, all tran&s;porta|tion
of corn from the remote parts of the country would
cea&s;e; &s;ince none but merchants would be at the trouble, or
run the hazard. The Ju&s;tice, however, &startq;fand the &s;um|mons
relevant;&endq; and &s;ome of the pannels were convicted:
But no &s;entence is marked in the record. The &s;ame is the
ca&s;e with re&s;pect to John White, John Mure and others,
who were convicted on the 25th of the &s;ame month, of fore|&s;talling
and regrating corn. I have ob&s;erved but one con|viction
more; that of John Reale, (or Rule), merchant in
Leith, convicted of fore&s;talling and regrating, by privately
purcha&s;ing a &s;hip load of timber in the harbour of that place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 19. and 20. 1607.</NOTE>
before landing or entry in the town's books, or the putting
of a price upon it by the Magi&s;trates, as directed by the
&s;tatutes 1540, c. 100.; 1555, c. 57. He had &s;entence in
terms of the &s;tatute, as for the fir&s;t offence.</P>
<P>WE know from the &s;tatute-book, that be&s;ide the laws
again&s;t fore&s;talling and regrating, the policy of former times
had &s;hackled the commerce of the lieges, with many other
<PB N="405" REF="406">
and more trouble&s;ome re&s;traints, (at lea&s;t they are thought
&s;o now), which were enforced by fines and confi&s;cations,
and in &s;ome in&s;tances by more &s;evere penalties. Accordingly
there are in&s;tances in the record, from time to time, of pro|&s;ecution
for &s;uch crimes as the&s;e: the tran&s;porting of tallow
forth of the kingdom; the &s;elling of linen, cattle, &amp;c. to
the Engli&s;h; and the enhancing of the price of malt<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Books of Adjournal, April 28. 1585, Inhabitants of Mu&s;&s;elburgh; June 9. 1596, Robert Knox.</NOTE>. But
it would &s;erve no purpo&s;e to enlarge on the&s;e points of dit|tay;
which were long ago thrown out of the criminal code,

the manners, opinions, and cu&s;tom of dealing of our people.</P>

As this high crime may be committed in a great variety

<P>AT the Union of the two kingdoms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And that of England extend|ed to Scotland.</NOTE> when, be&s;ide ac|knowledging
the &s;ame Prince, they were to be con&s;olidated
in one government, and ruled by the &s;ame Legi&s;lature, as
parts of one realm; it was plainly &s;een to be expedient, or

be placed upon the &s;ame footing, with re&s;pect al&s;o to the
bonds of their allegiance to that Government, and the con|&s;equences
of any violation of tho&s;e public and intere&s;ting

the act of Union, and in that article of it (the 18th)
which &s;aves and maintains the laws of &startq;Scotland, declaring,&endq;
that the laws which concern public right, policy and ci|vil
government, may be made the &s;ame throughout the
whole united kingdom.&endq; Under authority of which allow|ance,
and in order (as the title bears) to the improvement of
the Union of the two kingdoms, a &s;tatute was &s;oon after
made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th Anne, c. 21.</NOTE> in which it is declared, &startq;That &s;uch crimes and of|fences
which are high trea&s;on or mi&s;pri&s;ion of high trea|&s;on

trea&s;on within Scotland, but tho&s;e that are high trea&s;on

provides, that the pains, penalties and forfeitures of high
trea&s;on &s;hall be the &s;ame in both countries; and it appoints
a mode of inquiry and trial, &s;uch as is agreeable to the

<P>To be acquainted with this part of the &s;y&s;tem, the Scots

England. Now, as the&s;e are patent to all the world, and treat

doctrine, which had &s;ometimes been applied to it; whereby

&startq;when a man doth compa&s;s or imagine the death of our
Lord the King, or of our Lady the Queen, or of their
<PB N="409" REF="410">
elde&s;t Son and heir.&endq; By the&s;e words, it is not the
killing of the King that is alone made trea&s;on, but even to
compa&s;s or imagine his death; that is, to entertain the pur|po&s;e,
or conceive the de&s;ign, of aiming &s;o fatal a blow at
the tranquillity of the kingdom. In holding this to be a
crime of as deep a die as the actual perpetration of the
murder, it is &s;aid that the Engli&s;h Legi&s;lature had not
invented a new principle, but only recurred to an old
one. Their ancient writers, in treating of homicide, had
taught that the murderous intention, manife&s;ted by plain
facts, was of the &s;ame degree of guilt, and equally puni&s;h|able
as the complete crime; and this rule, though laid
a&s;ide as rigorous in regard to ordinary per&s;ons, the &s;tatute
of Edward has for the public benefit, and through &s;en&s;e of
the high national intere&s;t in the pre&s;ervation of the per&s;on of
the King, adopted and maintained in his particular ca&s;e. It
has been con&s;idered, that the life of the King cannot in the
ordinary cour&s;e of things be taken away, without involving
the whole land in blood&s;hed and confu&s;ion. &startq;The law
therefore (&s;ays Fo&s;ter) tendereth the &s;afety of the King

bordering upon jealou&s;y: It con&s;idereth the wicked
imaginations of the heart in the &s;ame degree of guilt as
if carried into actual execution, from the moment that

And this &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary in two

the purpo&s;e of the heart, the imagining of the King's death, is
&s;uch a matter as can only appear, or become the &s;ubject of
judicial cogni&s;ance, through &s;ome external act which is in|dicative
thereof, or connected with it. But farther, it
is not as evidence only of the trea&s;onable purpo&s;e that the
<HI>overt</HI> acts are to be con&s;idered, but as the means al&s;o made u&s;e
of to accompli&s;h that purpo&s;e, and which tend to carry it into

the only evidence of the trea&s;onable purpo&s;e. On &s;uch a ca&s;e

book, or compo&s;e and deliver a &s;ermon, which impeaches
all monarchy, and teaches that it is lawful to kill all Kings;
that he is guilty of a mo&s;t &s;editious act and a high mi&s;de|meanour,
and is therefore puni&s;hable, who can doubt? But
it &s;eems difficult, out of this general precept, nowi&s;e ap|plied,
nor more &s;pecially illu&s;trated, to make a trea&s;on of
compa&s;&s;ing the King's death. For, though it be of evil in|fluence
in that re&s;pect; it does not prove any re&s;olution or
purpo&s;e of the writer again&s;t the life of our Sovereign;
nor can be accounted &s;uch a mea&s;ure as tends directly to
his de&s;truction. But, if the book or di&s;cour&s;e, either open|ly,
or by plain in&s;inuation, arraign <HI>our Sovereign</HI> as a ty|rant,

public affairs at the time; and if it in&s;i&s;t on all the &s;uit|able
topics for encouragement of the King's &s;ubjects to &s;uch

it cannot rea&s;onably be denied of the per&s;on who delibe|rately

that he has the purpo&s;e of the King's death in his heart,
and has taken a material and mo&s;t dangerous &s;tep towards

that be they ever &s;o wicked and abominable, they do not at

<P>NEVERTHELESS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But Words ex|pound Acts into Trea&s;on.</NOTE> to be ju&s;t or rational, this rule mu&s;t be un|der&s;tood
with certain qualities and limitations; for we &s;hould
form a very fal&s;e notion of the law if we conceived it to
&s;tand thus, that words are utterly indifferent in this matter,
and in no circum&s;tances can amount to trea&s;on. All con&s;ul|tation
and debate, though purely verbal, how to kill the
King, or towards the levying of war to impri&s;on or depo&s;e
him, is an undoubted overt act of compa&s;&s;ing his death; be|cau&s;e
the words in &s;uch a ca&s;e are not the evidence only
of the traiterous purpo&s;e, but an act and mea&s;ure in pro&s;e|cution
of it, and which tends to the advancement of the pro|ject.
In like manner, by advice, or by argument and per|&s;ua&s;ion
to in&s;tigate any one to kill the King, is certainly
trea&s;on, though all pa&s;s in the form of words between the
parties per&s;onally pre&s;ent; and though there be no evidence
of the traiterous purpo&s;e, but this very in&s;tigation. <HI>A fortiori,</HI>
therefore, if there be any act or deed in the ca&s;e to which
the words refer; or which they apply and explain, as to the
meaning and &s;cope of it, or the <HI>animus</HI> with which it is
done; the words are here mo&s;t material to the charge, and
as they are or are not proved may determine the i&s;&s;ue of the
trial. For in&s;tance, the giving of money to A or B, may,
according to circum&s;tances, be either a virtuous or a criminal
<PB N="420" REF="421">
act, or in a great mea&s;ure indifferent. But if it is given
upon condition of killing the King, or as the reward of
that &s;tipulated &s;ervice; and if this is proved by the words
which pa&s;s on the occa&s;ion; then is this act explained and
characteri&s;ed after &s;uch a manner, as makes it an overt act
of trea&s;on; which it would not otherwi&s;e be. Such a ca&s;e,
and mentioned in that view by Hale and Fo&s;ter, was the ca&s;e
of Crohagan an Iri&s;h prie&s;t, in the reign of Charles I. who
was charged, &startq;That being at Li&s;bon in Portugal he u&s;ed
the&s;e words, <HI>I will kill the King if I can come at him,</HI>&endq; after
which he actually came to England, and was there taken.
Of it&s;elf, the man's coming into England was very innocent;
but explained as it was by this &s;peech, to have been with in|tent
to kill the King, it became a deci&s;ive overt act of trea|&s;on;
and the per&s;on had judgment accordingly. In &s;hort,
words may be &s;o joined to an act in an indictment of trea&s;on,
as to make the &s;ame applicable to, and expo&s;itive of, a com|pa&s;&s;ing
of the King's death; which act, if not &s;o expounded
and applied, would not be an overt act of trea&s;on, nor make

<P>TOUCHING the per&s;on who&s;e death is compa&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who is a King in this Que&s;tion.</NOTE>&mdash;it &s;eems
to be agreed that a Queen regnant, (but not the hu&s;band of
&s;uch a one) is within the meaning of the act; which is like|wi&s;e
true of the heir of the King from the moment of his
predece&s;&s;or's death, though not yet crowned<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 101&mdash;Hawkin's, vol. i. p. 36. No. 19, 20.&mdash;Black&s;t. vol. iv. p. 76, 77.</NOTE>. Al&s;o it &s;eems
not to be di&s;puted, that the &s;tatute applies to the King
<HI>de facto,</HI> to him who is in plenary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown,
though without rightful preten&s;ions, equally as to the King
<PB N="421" REF="422">
<HI>de jure.</HI> The rea&s;on of this lies in his admini&s;tration of the
laws and government for the time, and in the protection
thence derived by the inhabitants of the realm; in return for
which they owe him duty and allegiance, while his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
&s;hall endure.</P>
<P>FROM this, on the other &s;ide it follows, that the rightful
heir of the Crown, during &s;uch time as the u&s;urper is in ple|nary
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and while no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is in the heir, (as
was the ca&s;e with the Hou&s;e of York, during the reigns of
Henry IV. V. and VI.) is not a King within the &s;en&s;e of
the act of Edward, again&s;t whom any trea&s;on can be com|mitted.
In conformity to which principle, the &s;tatute 11th
Henry VII. c. 1. has pronounced all per&s;ons excu&s;ed of any
penalty or forfeiture, on account of a&s;&s;i&s;tance or obedience,
whether in the field or otherwi&s;e, rendered to the King in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for the time. This in truth can only be e&s;teemed
declaratory of the common law; as it were certainly again&s;t
all rea&s;on to pre&s;cribe the duty of allegiance towards a So|vereign,
how rightful &s;oever, who is in no condition to pro|tect
any one again&s;t the power or violence of the u&s;urper.</P>
<P>WHAT has now been &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who is a King in this Que&s;tion.</NOTE> &s;eems to be ju&s;tly applicable to
the ca&s;e of the rightful heir, who has never been in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
nor ve&s;ted with the character of King; and to whom,
as he has never yielded any protection, no allegiance can be
due. But it may be doubted how far the &s;ame will hold in
the ca&s;e of the rightful King who has once been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
and is turned out for a time by an u&s;urpation; which not|with&s;tanding,
he maintains his claim, continues to bear his
&s;tyle and title of King, and finally repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es him&s;elf of the
throne of his inheritance. This at lea&s;t is the opinion of Sir
<PB N="422" REF="423">
Mathew Hale<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 104. No. 1.</NOTE>, which I do not find expre&s;sly contravert|ed
by other authorities, but rather avoided to be touch|ed
on. Yet it may require to be con&s;idered, whether to
make this doctrine either equitable in it&s;elf, or con&s;i&s;tent
with what has already been &s;aid, a di&s;tinction mu&s;t not be
received between tho&s;e acts of compa&s;&s;ing, which may be
nece&s;&s;ary in compliance with the u&s;urper's dominion for the
time, and out of dread of his power and vengeance; and
tho&s;e voluntary attempts which proceed from the will and
affections of the party. Thus to be in arms, and in the
field again&s;t the rightful Sovereign, in his attempt to repo&s;|&s;e&s;s
him&s;elf of the throne, ought not to be con&s;trued trea&s;on;
becau&s;e perhaps the party dare not, for his per&s;onal &s;afety,
decline the &s;ervice. But &s;ecretly, and of free-will, or for
bribe and reward, to attempt to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate or poi&s;on the King
<HI>de jure,</HI> though out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is an act of a different and

<P>IT is farther to be ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen and Prince, if with|in the Act.</NOTE> and
the King's elde&s;t &s;on, that though they al&s;o are within the
words of the &s;tatute, yet they are not &s;o in the &s;ame ample and
plenary con&s;truction, as is the King him&s;elf; for their charac|ters
and &s;tations are ab&s;olutely different. The Sovereign is
&s;uch; one in whom the nation has the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible inte|re&s;t;
and who, as long as the government &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, cannot
be laid under any manner of force or re&s;traint: whereas,
viewed with re&s;pect to him, the Queen and Prince are &s;ub|jects,
capable of doing wrong, and liable to the controul and
coercion of law. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that there are
<PB N="423" REF="424">
certain overt acts of compa&s;&s;ing the King's death, which are
per&s;onal and appropriate to the King, and his &s;overeign power
and royal dignity; and are not applicable to the Queen or
Prince. The compa&s;&s;ing for in&s;tance, to depo&s;e the Queen,
or to con&s;train or impri&s;on the Prince, is not trea&s;on; be|cau&s;e
there are &s;ituations of offence and mi&s;demeanour on
the part of tho&s;e per&s;onages, where they are lawfully &s;ubject
to that &s;ort of proce&s;s. With re&s;pect to them, the com|pa&s;&s;ing
is therefore only to be under&s;tood of tho&s;e acts,
which go to a direct attempt upon their lives by force or
poi&s;on<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 127, 128.</NOTE>; and even again&s;t the&s;e the Queen enjoys the pro|tection
of the trea&s;on-laws as long only as &s;he is the Queen
Con&s;ort, the King's wife, and during the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of the
marriage between them<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, <HI>ib.</HI> p. 124.</NOTE>. Neither does any heir to the
Crown enjoy it, unle&s;s he be the King's &s;on: no collateral
heir enjoys it, nor even the elde&s;t daughter of the King,
when there is no &s;on; unle&s;s by &s;pecial provi&s;ion of the &s;tatute
for the ca&s;e<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Hale, <HI>ib.</HI> p. 125, 126.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>II. THE &s;econd point of trea&s;on &s;et down in the act of
Edward is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Violation of the Queen or Prin|ce&s;s.</NOTE> &startq;If a man do violate the King's companion or
the King's elde&s;t daughter unmarried, or the wife of the

and proud provi&s;ion of the law, on the notion &s;olely of the
per&s;onal contempt and in&s;ult to the Royal Family (though
certainly the&s;e are not to be overlooked); but is grounded in
a mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on of public intere&s;t, the expediency
of guarding the blood-royal again&s;t all &s;u&s;picion of ba&s;tar|dy,
and the nation again&s;t the manifold evils of a di&s;puted

&s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crown. In this article, as in the la&s;t, only
the Con&s;ort of the King and Prince, &s;till in life, is with|in
the act; but the elde&s;t daughter is within it, though
there be &s;ons exi&s;ting, who are before her in the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
to the Crown. In the ca&s;e of all the&s;e per&s;ons, it is
equally trea&s;on whether the carnal knowledge be by force
or by con&s;ent; and equally in the woman con&s;enting as in
the man<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, 128, 129&mdash;Hawkin's, vol. i. p. 37. No. 22.&mdash;Black&s;t. vol. iv. p. 81.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>1. THERE mu&s;t be a levying of war. Wherein are exclu|ded
all con&s;ultations, con&s;piracies, and projects to levy
war, though in them&s;elves complete, and how high &s;oever
their objects; if no war be in pur&s;uance thereof levied<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hawkin's, vol. i. p. 38. No. 27.&mdash;Fo&s;ter, p. 211, No. 3.&mdash;Hale, vol. i. p. 131.&mdash;Black&s;t, vol. iv. p. 82.</NOTE>
It has, however, been already &s;aid, that though ineffec|tual
in this point of view, &s;uch deliberation or con&s;piracy
will ju&s;tify an indictment for compa&s;&s;ing the King's death;
if the purpo&s;e of the meditated in&s;urrection be again&s;t the
per&s;on or government of the Sovereign.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="426">
BUT what &s;hall be con&s;trued to be a levying of war? Thus
far &s;eems not to be matter of controver&s;y,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is an Act of levying War.</NOTE> that any attack
made upon the King's forces is a &s;ufficient act of ho&s;tili|ty;
if it is not made upon occa&s;ional quarrel or &s;pecial
grudge, but for public rea&s;on of enmity to them, as the mi|litary
power and in&s;truments of the &s;tate, and in oppo&s;ition to
the government of the King. The &s;ame is true of the for|cible
holding out of a ca&s;tle or fort again&s;t the King's troops;
or the fortifying of one's own hou&s;e, or that of another,
with weapons, defen&s;ive or inva&s;ive, on purpo&s;e to make head
again&s;t the King and his power; nay of the bare rai|&s;ing
and a&s;&s;embling of a force, arrayed in manner of war,
or furni&s;hed with weapons bellical, though no manner of
combat or blood&s;hed en&s;ue<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">There are many convictions of trea&s;on in the Scots records, upon the ground of holding out a ca&s;tle again&s;t the King, after &s;ummons to &s;urrender; and on other the like grounds.

In the ca&s;e of Macleod of A&s;&s;int, February 2. 16. 1674. it was found relevant, &startq;that after publication of the commi&s;&s;ion of fire and &s;word, the pannel did rai&s;e or levy 100 men or up|wards in arms, and put them under officers or military di&s;cipline, or &s;wore them to colours, or had them under colours, or drilled them, or put them un|der daily, weekly, or monthly pay.&endq; As al&s;o, &startq;that after &s;uch publication, the pannel &s;tuffed, provided, and gari&s;oned the hou&s;e of Arbreck.&endq;</NOTE>. In the opinion of Fo&s;ter,
the like holds as to the mere detainer of the King's fort
or ca&s;tle from him, and the refu&s;al to receive him therein,
<PB N="426" REF="427">
though without employment of any other force; if it can
be &s;hown that this is done in confederacy with rebels<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 144, 150, 152. No. 9&mdash;Fo&s;ter, p. 218, 219. No. 9, 10.&mdash;Hawkin's, vol. i. p. 38.

<P>BUT it may al&s;o happen the general tranquillity to be en|dangered
by the a&s;&s;embling and continuing together of a
great but more tumultuous and di&s;orderly multitude; who
march in force upon &s;ome occa&s;ion of a public nature, and
proceed in the execution of an unlawful enterpri&s;e, with
a plain intent to defy the authority of the State. How far
this is to be accounted a levying of war, though the per&s;ons
are not li&s;ted and organi&s;ed after the fa&s;hion of a regular
military force, nor furni&s;hed with warlike weapons, but with
&s;uch rude in&s;truments only as can be had at the time; this is
a point which in the opinion of Sir Mathew Hale de&s;erved
to be con&s;idered, and which he forbore to decide<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 131, 151.</NOTE>. But the
que&s;tion has &s;ince been re&s;olved in the affirmative, by the
judgment in the ca&s;e of Damaree and Purcha&s;e, (commented
on and approved of by Fo&s;ter);<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 18. &amp; 21. 1710. St. Tr. vol. vi.</NOTE> in which the ground of charge
was the pulling down of the di&s;&s;enting meetinghou&s;es by a
tumultuous rabble, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome thou&s;ands, but armed
only with axes and crows, and other &s;uch in&s;truments as
were at hand, and &s;uitable to their purpo&s;e<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 208, 211, 212.</NOTE>. The difference
<PB N="427" REF="428">
therefore between &s;uch ca&s;es, and tho&s;e which are accompa|nied
with the order and pageantry of war, &s;eems rather to lie
in this; that in the former the charge of trea&s;on will only
be good upon the actual execution, in part at lea&s;t, of the
rebellious purpo&s;e of the a&s;&s;embly, by which alone the cha|racter
of their enterpri&s;e is clearly declared; and in the
latter it will be good upon the bare a&s;&s;embling or marching
and continuance in arms, which is it&s;elf an act of rebellion,
and ground of terror to the State, as well as a plain evi|dence
of their deliberate re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t and &s;ubdue all
power that &s;hall be &s;ent again&s;t them.</P>
<P>2. THE war mu&s;t be levied again&s;t the King.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The War levied mu&s;t be again&s;t the King.</NOTE> The rai&s;ing,
therefore, and drawing out of the mo&s;t regular military
force, nay the actual employment of it in rapine and blood|&s;hed,
is no trea&s;on; if all is done upon a private quarrel, and
to the injury of an individual only or family, without any
ho&s;tile view to the authority of the King, or the govern|ment
of the land. Under this de&s;cription would fall the
mutual ho&s;tilities and depredations, (happily not &s;o frequent
now as they once were), of two Highland clans, ari&s;ing out
of their ca&s;ual broils, or hereditary feuds. And thus it was
judged in England, of the quarrel between the Lords March|ers,
Hereford and Glouce&s;ter, in the 20th of Edward I.;
who had mutually made war upon each other, (according to
the cu&s;tom, they &s;aid, of the Lords Marchers), with banners
di&s;played, and a great power of both hor&s;e and foot.</P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, in the con&s;truction of law, the levying
of war again&s;t the King is not under&s;tood of tho&s;e in&s;ur|rections
only, which have immediate relation to the per&s;on
of his Maje&s;ty; as if the object be to dethrone or impri&s;on
<PB N="428" REF="429">
him, or to drive him out of the realm, or to cau&s;e him
alter his mea&s;ures, or to remove evil coun&s;ellors from his
pre&s;ence<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It was judged trea&s;on in the ca&s;e of the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, that he marched with an armed body from his hou&s;e into the city, and there prayed aid of the citizens to bring him into the Queen's pre&s;ence with a &s;trong hand, that he might re|move his enemies from about her. But this was laid as an overt act of com|pa&s;&s;ing the Queen's death. Hale, vol. i. p. 138, 139.</NOTE>. It equally embraces all tho&s;e ri&s;ings, which
though not aimed directly at the per&s;on of the King, are
however again&s;t his royal Maje&s;ty; that is again&s;t his Crown
or royal dignity; again&s;t his prerogative, authority, or office.
Under this de&s;cription, according to all authorities, falls an
in&s;urrection for any of the&s;e objects: to reform the e&s;tabli&s;hed
law, religion, or political con&s;titution of the land; or to ob|tain
redre&s;s of national grievances, whether real or imagi|nary.
For though they be real, the law and government
of the realm, as long as they &s;ub&s;i&s;t, cannot know any
thing of this cour&s;e of correcting them; nor make ac|count
of it as any other than rebellion again&s;t the King,
who, as head of the State, is bound to prevent all &s;uch for|cible

in that ca&s;e, &s;o for &s;uch &s;ituations there can be no
rule in the law of any country<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 210, 211. No. 3, 4.&mdash;Black&s;t. vol. iv. p. 81, 82.&mdash;Hale, vol. i. p. 152, 131, 132.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS con&s;tructive levying of war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;tructive le|vying of War again&s;t the King.</NOTE> is under&s;tood in even a

it to all &s;y&s;tematic and exten&s;ive oppo&s;ition of the laws
and executive authority of the realm, in matters of general
concern. Thus to pull down all pri&s;ons and courts of ju&s;tice,
or all cu&s;tomhou&s;es and hou&s;es of revenue; to throw open
all inclo&s;ures; to rai&s;e all wages of labour; to abate all rents
and prices of provi&s;ions; to hinder the collection or pay|ment
of all taxes; to prevent the trial of all traitors: all
the&s;e alarming and exten&s;ive projects of forcible oppo&s;ition
to the King's laws <HI>generally,</HI> are, by con&s;truction, within
the clau&s;e of the &s;tatute as to levying of war. For if the
per&s;ons who are concerned in the maintaining and enforcing
of tho&s;e matters &s;hall re&s;i&s;t and oppo&s;e this u&s;urpation, accord|ing
to their duty; then is the whole country involved in ho|&s;tility,
and it cannot be fore&s;een to what other new objects
the rebellion thus &s;et on foot may extend it&s;elf. It is no le&s;s
obvious, that be&s;ide their immediate tendency to unhinge
the whole frame of &s;ociety, &s;uch enterpri&s;es are in a pecu|liar
manner again&s;t the King's Maje&s;ty as protector of his
people, di&s;pen&s;er of ju&s;tice, and Supreme Executive Magi|&s;trate;
to whom is entru&s;ted the defence of property, and
the con&s;ervation of peace, and of the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of
things. That no ill is intended to the per&s;on of the King,
is not material; if his office and authority are forcibly de|fied
in any thing which by the law and his prerogative he
has right or is bound to do in the government, as King<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, p. 132. <HI>et &s;eq.</HI>&mdash;Fo&s;ter, p. 211, 212.&mdash;Hawkins, vol. i. p. 37. No. 25.&mdash;Black&s;t. vol. iv. p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE noted in&s;tance of the application of this principle
was in the ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;tructive le|vying of War again&s;t the King. April 18. 21. 1710.</NOTE> already mentioned, of Damaree and Pur|cha&s;e;

meetinghou&s;es<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Fo&s;ter, p. 214, 215.</NOTE>, and for which they both had judgment, as
for an act of levying of war again&s;t the King. The &s;ame
had been ruled in the 20th of Charles II. by the opinion of
all the Judges except Sir Mathew Hale, in the ca&s;e of an
armed convocation of apprentices in the city of London,
who a&s;&s;embled to pull down <HI>all</HI> bawdy hou&s;es<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 134. Peter Ma&s;&s;enger, and others&punc; were tried on 4th April 1668, for a&s;&s;embling with weapons, and proceeding under a Captain, and with an En&s;ign, to pull down bawdyhou&s;es. The Court gave this opinion: &startq;By levying of war is not only meant when an army is gathered together, as an army is, but if a company of people will go about any public reformation, this is high trea&s;on, if it be but to pull down inclo&s;ures; for they take upon them the regal authority. The&s;e people do pretend their de&s;ign was again&s;t bawdyhou&s;es.

&s;everal in pro&s;ecution of their purpo&s;e. The like opinion had
governed in the con&s;truction of another of the trea&s;on laws,
the &s;tatute of the 13th of Elizabeth, c. 1. under which it
was trea&s;on even to <HI>con&s;pire or intend</HI> to levy war again&s;t the
King. For in the ca&s;e of Grant and others, in the 37th of
Elizabeth, it was judged to be trea&s;on within this &s;tatute,
that the apprentices in London had con&s;pired and a&s;&s;embed
with intent to kill the Lord Mayor, to burn his hou&s;e, and
deliver certain of their companions who had been impri|&s;oned
by the Mayor, on account of a proclamation made
by them concerning the price of victuals. In the trial like|wi&s;e
of Robert Burton and others, the &s;ame &s;tatute was
held to reach the ca&s;e of a con&s;piracy to ri&s;e in arms, and
&s;et out upon a general enterpri&s;e of pulling down inclo&s;ures<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 144, 145.</NOTE>.</P>

IT is obvious that &s;uch projects of exten&s;ive and &s;y&s;tema|tical

are of a more contemptuous character, and involve far more
audacious motives, as well as higher con&s;equences, than tho&s;e
&s;udden and limited di&s;turbances which ari&s;e from &s;pecial
grudge and provocation; or are calculated to get rid of &s;ome
local grievance, in which the offenders them&s;elves have, or
think they have, a peculiar concern. A ri&s;ing for in&s;tance
to throw open a certain common, to pull down a certain
gaol, to hinder the execution of &s;uch a criminal, or to abate
the price of grain in the market of a certain place: this
does not involve ho&s;tility to the State, nor any general plan
of &s;preading rebellion again&s;t the law or government; and
though &s;everely puni&s;hable as a riot, is, however, in compari|&s;on
of the other in&s;tances, a mere private outrage or effu&s;ion of
pa&s;&s;ion, which could not with propriety be made the ground
of a charge of trea&s;on. Upon this di&s;tinction it was, that
on occa&s;ion of tho&s;e two noted commotions in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 1725. Mar. 1737.</NOTE>
commonly called <HI>Shawfield's mob</HI> and the <HI>Porteous mob,</HI> though
not altogether void of &s;ome affinity to a levying of war, it
was yet judged proper to proceed again&s;t the offenders as
guilty of the lower offence. It is true, that in the one in&s;tance
there was an interference with the cour&s;e of the royal mercy,
by the execution of a capital convict who had been re|prieved;
and in the other, the hou&s;e of a member of Parlia|ment
had been pillaged and demoli&s;hed, in re&s;entment of his
conduct in that capacity, on occa&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ing of a cer|tain
revenue law. But as it was plain, upon the whole cir|cum&s;tances
of the ca&s;e of <HI>Porteous,</HI> that there was no im|peachment
among the multitude of the royal prerogative
of mercy, nor any project of oppo&s;ition to it <HI>generally;</HI>
but only a quarrel with the exerci&s;e of it in a parti|cular

in&s;tance, and on account of &s;pecial enmity of the of|fenders
to the per&s;on who was the object of mercy; the crime
was therefore ju&s;tly held not to be trea&s;on, but a ca&s;e of riot
only and murder. The &s;ame judgment was properly given
with re&s;pect al&s;o to the other ca&s;e: becau&s;e all was done with
the purpo&s;e of injury to the particular man, with whom, as
their repre&s;entative, the offenders were peculiarly connec|ted;
and not as part of any great combination for re&s;i&s;tance
of the tax every where, and abu&s;e of all concerned in
the pa&s;&s;ing or executing of the law; for in that ca&s;e it would
have amounted to trea&s;on<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See ca&s;e of Maclauchlane, March 1737; and of the Darrachs, September 1725.</NOTE>. A more ambiguous ca&s;e than
either of the&s;e, and upon which accordingly the Judges of
England differed in opinion, is that related by Hale, of the
great ri&s;ing of the weavers, to de&s;troy the engine looms for
weaving ribbons; which re&s;olution they put in practice,
with many circum&s;tances of aggravation, not in one place
only, but in &s;undry places of &s;everal counties. The enter|pri&s;e
was thus, in &s;ome &s;ort, of a general nature. But it was
al&s;o a particular quarrel, between men of the &s;ame trade,
about a particular engine, which they thought a grievance
to them; and in this it was unlike the de&s;ign of altering re|ligion
or laws, or pulling down inclo&s;ures generally, or en|tirely
to de&s;troy any trade or calling. The re&s;ult of the
con&s;ultation was, that the offenders were proceeded again&s;t,

IN the clo&s;e of all, it may be ob&s;erved of the&s;e con&s;truc|tive
ways of levying war, which have no immediate relation

<P>3. THE war mu&s;t be levied again&s;t the King <HI>within his

<P>IV. THE article immediately &s;ubjoined to that of levying
war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adherence to the King's Ene|mies.</NOTE> is of a nature nearly allied to it, and is thus de&s;cribed
in the &s;tatute. &startq;If a man be adherent to the King's ene|mies
within the realm, giving to them aid or comfort
within the realm or el&s;ewhere.&endq; There are two kinds
of warlike force, again&s;t which the law has to provide &s;ecu|rity
to the King. There is the ho&s;tility on the part of
rebels, who have broken the allegiance which they owe to
his Maje&s;ty, and whom to aid or comfort is a levying of
war, either direct or con&s;tructive, under the clau&s;e of the
&s;tatute la&s;t examined; and there is the ho&s;tility on the part
of foreign and open enemies, who owe no &s;uch allegiance,
and who if taken in arms, could not them&s;elves be demean|ed
as traitors, (having broken no bond of &s;ubjection), but
would be treated as pri&s;oners of war. Tho&s;e, however, of
<PB N="434" REF="435">
his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects who adhere unto &s;uch open enemies;
who, contrary to their allegiance, give them aid and comfort,
are in a far more unfavourable &s;ituation; and in terms of
this clau&s;e, which re&s;ts upon the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons of
policy and ju&s;tice, are &s;ubject to the pains of trea&s;on, though
the enemies to whom they adhere are not. The &s;ame acts
of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which if lent to rebels would make a levying
of war, being lent to enemies, are of cour&s;e acts of trea&s;on|able
adherence within the &s;tatute.</P>

<P>V. THE fifth &s;ort of trea&s;on &s;et down in the act of Ed|ward
is, &startq;If a man counterfeit the King's Great or Privy
Seal.&endq; In &s;upplement of this, the act of the 7th of Anne
c. 21. provides, &startq;That if any per&s;on counterfeit her Ma|je&s;ty's
&s;eals appointed by the 24th article of Union to be
kept, u&s;ed and continued in Scotland, that the doing there|of
&s;hall be con&s;trued and adjudged to be trea&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>VI. ONE trea&s;on more, mentioned in the act of Edward
is, &startq;If a man counterfeit the King's money; or if a man
bring fal&s;e money into this realm, counterfeit to the mo|ney
of England, as the money called Lu&s;burgh or other,
like to the &s;aid money of England, knowing the money
to be fal&s;e, to merchandi&s;e or make payment, in deceit of
our Lord the King and of his people.&endq; Under the&s;e words,
according to Hawkins and Hale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 1. c. 17. No. 69. B. 1. c. 20. p. 229.</NOTE> who in this argue again&s;t
the opinion of Lord Coke, the gui$t is attached to the act
of importing counterfeit Briti&s;h money with <HI>intent</HI> to mer|chandi&s;e
<PB N="438" REF="439">
or make payment therewith, though no payment
be made. Tho&s;e who coin the King's money are guilty
of trea&s;on, whether they utter it or not; but the bare ut|tering,
without participation in the counterfeiting or im|porting,
does not fall within the words of this clau&s;e. Nei|ther
is any but gold or &s;ilver coin held to be the King's
money in the &s;en&s;e of the &s;tatute; much le&s;s any thing that
is counterfeited after the &s;imilitude of a foreign coin, even
though made current here by proclamation<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Hale, vol. i. p. 227. No. 2.&mdash;Hawkins, vol. i. p. 42. No. 55, 56, 57.&mdash;Black&s;t. vol. iv. p. 84.</P>
<P>By &s;tatute 16th Geo. II. c. 28. the coining of copper money is puni&s;hed with two years impri&s;onment; by the 11th Geo. III. c. 40. it is made felony; as it al&s;o is to buy, &s;ell, take, receive, pay or put off, any counterfeit copper money, at a lower rate than the &s;ame by its denomination doth import.</P>
<P>In September 1729, William Deane, indicted of counterfeiting and uttering halfpence, was tried not as for trea&s;on, but by our ordinary forms, and on con|viction he had &s;entence of pillory and tran&s;portation.</P></NOTE>. But of this
more at large, when we come to treat of the new and in|&s;tituted
trea&s;ons; of which the greater part have relation to
the coin.</P>
<P>VII. THE only other trea&s;on &s;et down in the act of Ed|ward
is, &startq;If a man &s;lay the Chancellor, Trea&s;urer, or the
King's Ju&s;tices of the one Bench or the other, Ju&s;tices in
Eyre, or Ju&s;tices of A&s;&s;ize, and all other Ju&s;tices a&s;&s;igned
to hear and determine, being in their places doing their
offices.&endq;</P>
<P>IN this article al&s;o, the Supreme Judges of the two king|doms
have been placed upon an equal footing of dignity and
&s;ecurity, by the &s;aid act of the 7th of Anne. It provides,
that if any per&s;on &s;hall &s;lay any of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, or
Lords of Ju&s;ticiary &s;itting in judgment in the exerci&s;e of their
<PB N="439" REF="440">
office within Scotland, that the doing thereof &s;hall be con|&s;trued,
adjudged, and taken to be high trea&s;on<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>The following are &s;ome of the chief Scotti&s;h trea&s;ons, of a public and in|tere&s;ting nature, which were aboli&s;hed by the communication of the law of Eng|land. By &s;tatute 1584, c. 130. it was trea&s;on to impugn the dignity, or to &s;eek or procure the diminution of the power of authority of the three E&s;tates of Par|liament, or any of them. It was upon this &s;tatute, along with other grounds, that James Skene had &s;entence as a traitor, on the 22d November 1680. He had publicly di&s;claimed the authority of King and Parliament, in all matters con|trary to the Covenant; and to this opinion, he with un&s;haken firmne&s;s adhered, fir&s;t before the Council, and afterwards upon his trial, to the Court and jury; and profe&s;&s;ed that he held it an honour to bear te&s;timony with his blood to &s;uch a doctrine.</P>
<P>By the act 1584, c. 129. it was declared, that the King was judged compe|tent to per&s;ons of every e&s;tate, degree, or function, &s;piritual or temporal, in all matters wherein they &s;hould be called to an&s;wer before him, or his Council; and to decline the authority of him, or his Council therein, was made trea&s;on. This act was principally levelled again&s;t the trouble&s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tics of the time, who, under pretence of &s;peaking to matters of church government, filled the pulpits with &s;edition, and inflamed the people with jealou&s;y and hatred of the temporal powers; and when called to an&s;wer for &s;uch conduct before the King and Council, they declined their authority as in a &s;piritual matter. But this act &s;eems very rarely to have been executed <HI>ad rigorem.</HI> In 1596, one Black, a mini&s;ter, con|victed upon the &s;tatute, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a &s;light cen&s;ure. On the 10th Janua|ry 1606, John Forbes, and other five mini&s;ters, al&s;o convicted on the &s;tatute, were bani&s;hed the King's dominions. In Augu&s;t 1610, Andrew Crichton was indeed condemned to die, as mentioned by Mackenzie; but this &s;entence was commuted for bani&s;hment, February 27. 1611. This too was one of the charges-again&s;t Ogilvy, who &s;uffered death in 1615; but he was al&s;o charged as a Je&s;uit, and with the &s;aying of ma&s;s, and a&s;&s;erting the juri&s;diction of the Pope, which was a capital offence of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The act 1661, c. 3. declares his Maje&s;ty's prerogative in the calling and di&s;|&s;olving of Parliament, and the nece&s;&s;ity of his con&s;ent to the pa&s;&s;ing of any act; and makes it trea&s;on to impugn the $ame, or call it in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>If offences of this nature, which were properly acts of &s;edition, were to be puni&s;hed with the pains of trea&s;on, it would have been proper to employ more definite terms in the de&s;cription of them, as well as to have di&s;tingui&s;h|ed the different ways of committing them, whether by writing and printing, or by advi&s;ed, or unadvi&s;ed di&s;cour&s;e. Several additions were made to this de&s;cription of trea&s;ons by the&s;e &s;tatutes: 1689, c. 1. c. 2. 1703, c. 1. c. 3.; by the la&s;t of which, it was made trea&s;on by writing, advi&s;ed &s;peaking, or open deed, to impugn, or endeavour to alter the claim of right.</P>
<P>Mackenzie has &s;hortly taken notice of that point of trea&s;on which con&s;i&s;ted in abiding frae the ho&s;t, that is in failure to obey the King's &s;ummons to the field, in ca&s;e of rebellion or inva&s;ion of enemies. Again&s;t &s;uch defaulter$, the &s;tatute 1424, c. 4. provided, that they &s;hould be proceeded again&s;t as favourers of the rebels. And in the ca&s;e of John Connell, John Wight, John Allan, and others, April 20. 21. 1599, judgment accordingly pa&s;&s;ed, declaring the forfeiture of all their lands and goods, and appointing their per&s;ons to be warded during the plea&s;ure of the King. That ever judgment of death was given again&s;t a defaulters as a proper traitor, I do not find. And, in later times, after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a more re|gular military force, even the forfeiture of lands was laid a&s;ide for puni&s;hment by fine. There are many pro&s;ecutions upon this ground in the years 1679 and 1680, for failure to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the rebels in the well. However, by a letter of the 26th November 1679, the King con&s;ented that the fine &s;hould not be carried beyond two years rent of the offender's e&s;tate; and that de&s;erters, though puni&s;hable with death, &s;hould be proceeded again&s;t as ab&s;ents. The truth &s;eems to be, that the law was u&s;ed at this time as an engine for drawing money from the di&s;affected. See March 9.; February 23. 26. 1680.</P></NOTE>.</P>

VIII. SOMETHING &s;hall now be added re&s;pecting certain
in&s;tituted and &s;tatutory trea&s;ons of a later date;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trea&s;ons rela|tive to the Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;|&s;ion.</NOTE> &s;ome of
which are in effect exceptions to the con&s;truction which
the act of Edward would have received. It has been &s;aid
that words, even though committed to the forms of wri|ting
or printing, and much more if only uttered, are not
a &s;ufficient overt act of trea&s;on, reducible to any of the
heads of that enactment; if they are only words of &s;pecu|lation
and opinion, not of exhortation or direct advice to
&s;ome act again&s;t the King, or &s;uch as nece&s;&s;arily tend to

his immediate danger. It would not, for in&s;tance, be trea&s;on
under the act of Edward (though, as a &s;lander, and tending
to di&s;affection, it would be puni&s;hable at common law) to de|ny
the King's title to the Crown, or to affirm the title of an|other
in preference of him, or to deny the right of Parliament
to bind the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown by laws. But the particu|lar
circum&s;tances of the&s;e realms con&s;idered, with re&s;pect to
a point &s;o intere&s;ting to the national freedom and tranquil|lity,
it has been thought warrantable to innovate upon this
rule, by a &s;pecial provi&s;ion for &s;ecurity of the Prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.
The act of the 6th of Anne, c. 7. which pa&s;&s;ed at
the time of a projected inva&s;ion by the then Pretender, and
is copied from a temporary &s;tatute of Elizabeth, has there|fore
made it trea&s;on, advi&s;edly and directly, by writing or
printing, to maintain and affirm, that any per&s;on has right
to the Crown of the&s;e realms, otherwi&s;e than according to
the act of &s;ettlement; or that the Kings of this realm, with
the authority of Parliament, are not competent to make
laws and &s;tatutes to bind the Crown and the de&s;cent there|of<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">To do the &s;ame thing maliciou&s;ly and directly, but only by preaching, teach|ing, or advi&s;ed &s;peaking, (without writing or printing), does, by the &s;ame &s;tatute, &s;ubject to the penalties of a <HI>praemunire;</HI> which are the forfeiture of lands and te|nements, goods and chat$els, and impri&s;onment during the King's plea&s;ure. Even to maintain the &s;ame things heedle&s;sly, in common and unadvi&s;ed di&s;cour&s;e, is accounted a contempt which may be puni&s;hed by impri&s;onment and fine. By &s;tatute 6th Anne, c. 23. it is al&s;o a <HI>praemunire</HI> if the Peers of Scotland, a&s;&s;em|bled to elect their repre&s;entatives, &s;hall pre&s;ume to treat of any matter but the election.</NOTE>. By a prior &s;tatute, 1&s;t Anne, St. 2. c. 17. it had al&s;o been
made trea&s;on, by any direct and overt act, to endeavour to
hinder the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of any per&s;on to the Crown, being the
next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion according to the limitations of the act of
&s;ettlement.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="443">
OTHER interpo&s;itions have al&s;o been made with a view to
the &s;ame important object. By &s;tatute 13th and 14th of
William III. c. 3. it was made trea&s;on, by letters, me&s;&s;ages,
or otherwi&s;e, to hold corre&s;pondence with the then Pretend|er,
or any one employed for him, or knowingly to remit
money for his u&s;e. By &s;tatute 17th George II. c. 39. the
&s;ame is declared with re&s;pect to corre&s;pondence with any of
his &s;ons, or the remitting of money to their u&s;e; as well as
it is made trea&s;on for any of tho&s;e per&s;ons to land, or at|tempt
to land in this Kingdom, or to be found in Great Bri|tain
or Ireland, or any of the dominions belonging to the
&s;ame.</P>
<P>IX. The &s;econd branch of in&s;tituted trea&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trea&s;ons relative to the Prote$$ant Religion.</NOTE> is nearly
related to the fir&s;t; and includes tho&s;e extraordinary provi|&s;ions,
which have been thought nece&s;&s;ary towards the &s;ecuri|ty
of the reformed religion, and the exclu&s;ion of the Popi&s;h:
a matter which, on account of the &s;trict connection of the
latter with certain temporal doctrines and principles of go|vernment,
has been the object of the peculiar anxiety of the
Legi&s;lature. In this view, the adherents of the Popi&s;h com|munion
have been made liable to many civil di&s;abilities, and
inferior penalties, which &s;hall be taken notice of in their pro|per
place. But the offences of this &s;ort, which have been
reckoned of &s;o heinous a degree as to de&s;erve being placed in
the rank of trea&s;on, are only three in number. By &s;tatute 27th
Elizabeth, c. 2. if any Popi&s;h prie&s;t, born in the dominions of
the Crown of England, &s;hall come over hither from beyond
the &s;eas; or &s;hall tarry here three days without conforming
to the church; this is trea&s;on. By &s;tatute 5th Elizabeth,
c. 1. it is al&s;o trea&s;on, if a per&s;on &s;hall be twice convicted of
advi&s;edly maintaining or defending the Pope's juri&s;diction,
<PB N="443" REF="444">
heretofore claimed in this realm. By 13th Elizabeth,

<P>X. THE third and la&s;t &s;ort of &s;pecial &s;tatutory trea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trea&s;ons rela|tive to the Coin of the Realm.</NOTE> is
one which comes more into practice than either of the others;
and relates to the injuring or fal&s;ifying of the current coin of
the realm. It has been &s;aid that this matter was touched up|on
in the &s;tatute of Edward, but only as to two &s;pecies of traffic
in fal&s;e coin; &s;o that in later times, according to the progre&s;s
of ingenuity and invention in this gainful &s;ort of fraud, large
additions have been thought nece&s;&s;ary to be made to this part
of the code of trea&s;on. 1. By 1&s;t Mary, St. 2. c. 6. it is
trea&s;on to counterfeit any foreign coin of gold or &s;ilver, that is
current within this realm by con&s;ent of the Crown; or to
forge the &s;ign manual, Privy Signet, or Privy Seal. 2. By
1&s;t and 2d Philip and Mary, c. 11. it is al&s;o trea&s;on to bring
into the realm any &s;uch fal&s;e or counterfeit foreign mo|ney,
to the intent to merchandi&s;e therewith; under which
words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hale, vol, i; p. 229. Hawkins, b. 1. c. 17. No. 69.</NOTE> in the opinion of Hale and Hawkins the import|ing
<HI>eo animo,</HI> without actual uttering, is &s;ufficient. 3. By
5th Elizabeth, c. 11. whoever &s;hall wa&s;h, clip, round or
file, and by 18th of Elizabeth, c. 1. whoever &s;hall impair,
dimini&s;h, fal&s;ify, &s;cale or lighten the proper coin of this
<PB N="444" REF="445">
realm, or that of other realms made current here by procla|mation,
is to be deemed an offender in high trea&s;on. 4. By
8th and 9th William III. c. 26. made perpetual by 7th Anne,
c. 25. whoever &s;hall knowingly make or mend, buy or &s;ell,
or have in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, any in&s;truments proper only for the
coinage of money, or &s;hall convey &s;uch in&s;truments out of
the King's mint, &s;hall be guilty of trea&s;on. 5. The &s;tatute
declares the &s;ame, with re&s;pect to him who &s;hall mark any
coin on the edges after the manner u&s;ed in the mint, or &s;hall
colour, gild, or ca&s;e over any coin re&s;embling the cur|rent
coin, or even round blanks of ba&s;e metal. In the 6th
and la&s;t place, by &s;tatute 15th and 16th, Geo. II. c. 28. he
al&s;o is to &s;uffer the pains of trea&s;on, who &s;hall colour or alter
any current &s;ilver coin of this realm, to make it re&s;emble a
gold one, or any copper coin, to make it re&s;emble a coin of
&s;ilver.</P>
<P>BEFORE I di&s;mi&s;s this article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May coining be libelled ag$in&s;t the Scots Sta|tutes.</NOTE> it may be proper to ob|&s;erve,
that by the practice of Scotland before the Union,
all the offences above enumerated, were puni&s;hable more or
le&s;s, and mo&s;t of them with the highe&s;t pains of law. And
here ari&s;es a que&s;tion, which may de&s;erve to be taken notice
of, whether, notwith&s;tanding the general &s;tatute which has
rai&s;ed the&s;e offences to the rank of trea&s;on, they &s;till re|tain
their former &s;tation al&s;o, and may be tried, if the pro|&s;ecutor
plea&s;es, by our ordinary forms, upon a libel which
charges them as fal&s;ehoods, and concludes for puni&s;hment
according to the law of Scotland. The rea&s;ons again&s;t it
&s;eem, however, to be &s;trong, and are chiefly the&s;e. 1. The
benefit of the new denomination of tho&s;e offences is not en|tirely
to the pro&s;ecutor, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the pri&s;on|er
too; who mu&s;t have a bill found again&s;t him by a grand
jury before he can be tried, and otherwi&s;e enjoys all the ad|vantages,
what&s;oever they be, of a trial according to the
<PB N="445" REF="446">
Engli&s;h forms. 2. This is not like the ca&s;e of a new quality
added by &s;tatute to a &s;ingle offence, (as in the ca&s;e of murder
under tru&s;t, or theft in landed men), and which enactment
is con&s;i&s;tent with the train of prior laws upon the &s;ame mat|ter.
It is the introduction of an entire new &s;y&s;tem, rela|tive
to a whole department of crimes, whereof the rank and
character was meant to be fundamentally altered; &s;o that
the field mu&s;t be held to be clear of all prior laws upon the
&s;ubject, as far as contrary to the new provi&s;ion. Now that
&s;y&s;tem is ab&s;olute in the direction which it gives, that
the&s;e offences &s;hall be taken, adjudged, and deemed to be
trea&s;on, and the offenders be tried and puni&s;hed as offenders
in trea&s;on. This point was debated at large in the ca&s;e of
William Deane, indicted in September 1729, for fal&s;ehood and
coining of halfpence; and there the trial proceeded by our
ordinary forms, and the pannel being convicted, had &s;entence
of pillory and tran&s;portation. But as it is clear that the
coining of copper money is not trea&s;on, which po&s;ition al&s;o
was fully argued in &s;upport of the propriety of the charge;
&s;o it cannot be &s;aid that this was a judgment on the point.
In the only other trial for coining that has been &s;ince the
Union, that of John Smith, in the Court of Ju&s;ticiary, July
1749, the pro&s;ecution was conducted and brought to an i&s;&s;ue
again&s;t the pri&s;oner, in all re&s;pects as a trial for trea&s;on.
But however this may be; certain it is, with re&s;pect to all
o$$ences again&s;t the coin which are not trea&s;on by the law of
England, that the&s;e remain upon the &s;ame footing as before
the Union, and liable to pro&s;ecution on the Scotti&s;h &s;ta|tutes.
For which rea&s;on, I &s;hall afterwards treat of the
Scotti&s;h practice touching offences again&s;t the coin, as in|&s;ringements
of the prerogative of the King.</P>
<P><PB N="446" REF="447">
I SHALL now clo&s;e this enumeration of the different heads
of trea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Trea&s;on all are principals.</NOTE> by taking notice of one circum&s;tance which is
common to them all, viz. That in the language of law,
there are no acce&s;&s;aries in trea&s;on, neither before nor after
the fact; the &s;ame things that make a per&s;on acce&s;&s;ary in
other ca&s;es, making him principal in trea&s;on, on account
of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the crime. By incitement, therefore,
or aid towards the commi&s;&s;ion of an act of trea&s;on; or
by comforting or harbouring the traitor after his deed
is done; or by re&s;cuing him from the officers of ju&s;tice;
or by a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to break the gaol, or even allowing him
to e&s;cape; a per&s;on, in the &s;trictne&s;s of the law, becomes
liable to the pains of trea&s;on. Indeed, as Fo&s;ter has ob|&s;erved,
and after him Black&s;tone; from the very nature
of that head of trea&s;on which relates to compa&s;&s;ing the death
of the king, there can be no acce&s;&s;aries before the fact;
&s;ince the mere preparation, con&s;piracy, or advice to do the
thing, it&s;elf amounts to a principal trea&s;on or overt act of
compa&s;&s;ing; though the deed in contemplation &s;hould never
be done, nor even attempted. In delivering this doctrine,
the later authorities have not even made any expre&s;s excep|tion
of tho&s;e trea&s;ons, which relate to the coin or royal
&s;eals<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Hale, vol. i. p. 233. <HI>et &s;eq,</HI>&mdash;Hawkins, vol. ii. p. 310. No. 2, 3.&mdash;Black&s;t. vol. iv. p. 35.&mdash;Fo&s;ter, p. 341. <HI>et &s;eq.</HI></P>
<P>This of puni&s;hing the re&s;etters of rebels, as art and part of the trea&s;on, is not however a novelty in the practice of Scotland. There are two &s;trong &s;tatutes to that effect, 1424, c. 37. and 1592, c. 146.; which &s;eem in practice to have been applied to the re&s;etting of any one who either had been forfeited in ab&s;ence, or &s;ugitate and denounced upon libel for trea&s;on; or again&s;t whom letters of intercom|muning had i&s;&s;ued by warrant from the Privy Council. It even appears from the enactment of the &s;tatute 1693, c. 33. that the&s;e proceedings had been held to beget an ab&s;olute pre&s;umption again&s;t the re&s;etter, of his knowledge of the qua|lity and &s;ituation, and even of the per&s;on of the man whom he harboured; for it requires a proof of the pannel's knowledge of the per&s;on from the pro&s;ecutor, as a new thing, and in derogation of former practice. Nay, it was decided in more than one ca&s;e, and e&s;pecially in the&s;e, Fergu&s;on and Cairns, December 11. 1682; and William Lawry, January 31. February 5. 1683; that the &s;ame was law with re&s;pect to per&s;ons, neither denounced nor intercommuned, if they were notour rebels, or per&s;ons who were holden and reputed to have been in the rebellion.</P>
<P>In general, it &s;eems to be true, that with re&s;pect to all acce&s;&s;ion, whether be|fore the fact, by advice, command, in&s;tigation or the like, or after it by ratiha|bition, re&s;etting, concealing, or the like, the practice of Scotland was far more rigorous in the ca&s;e of trea&s;on than of any other crime. In &s;o much that even in the trial of coiners, concealment and re&s;fe &s;eem to have been relevant grounds of charge. The old libels for that crime, <HI>uniformly</HI> charge the pannel, &startq;as art and part, redd, coun&s;el and concealing.&endq; And, on the 3d March 1598, Ralph&punc; Wallace has &s;entence as a traitor, for re&s;etting Hew Brunton a coiner, and allow|ing him to e&s;cape from ju&s;tice, after being taken.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="448">
XI. BEFORE proceeding to the mode of trial for trea&s;on, it
may be proper &s;hortly to inquire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who may be quilty of Trea|&s;on.</NOTE> concerning the per&s;ons by
whom trea&s;on may be committed. The general an&s;wer on
this head, naturally ari&s;es from the account that has been gi|ven
of the crime: As it is an infringement of the allegi|ance
of a &s;ubject to the Prince, &s;o all may be guilty of it,
by whom that allegiance is due.</P>
<P>Now, allegiance is not all upon one ground and rea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Natural bor$ Subjects.</NOTE> but
of two &s;orts, natural or local, which are drawn from &s;our|ces,
that are in &s;ome mea&s;ure different. The natural, in|trin&s;ic,
or primitive allegiance, is that which is due by the
natural born &s;ubject of Great Britain; he who is born with|in
the realm, or even out of it (under certain exceptions),
if born of a Briti&s;h father. And which per&s;on, as by his
birth he is a member of the &s;ociety of the inhabitants of
this land; and is protected by its laws and government, at
<PB N="448" REF="449">
a &s;ea&s;on when he is de&s;titute and helple&s;s; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, as
his birthright, (in virtue of his nativity alone), a great va|riety
of valuable privileges, &s;uch as the capacity of landed
property, of public office, of a &s;hare in the Legi&s;lature, and
the like; &s;o mu&s;t he &s;tand in a &s;tate of &s;trict relation to the
Sovereign, who is the head of that &s;ociety, and under who&s;e
guardian&s;hip and admini&s;tration all this protection is enjoy|ed, and the&s;e privileges are en&s;orced and maintained<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 183. No. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As on the one hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Owe perpetual Allegiance.</NOTE> the&s;e franchi&s;es attach upon the per&s;on
(<HI>inhaerent o&s;&s;ibus,</HI> according to the &s;tyle of law) and can by
nothing but a man's own crime be forfeited; &s;o is the
obligation of allegiance to our King equally permanent and
indefea&s;ible, and what a man can by no act of his own
ca&s;t off, nor transfer to another Prince. Go into what part
of the world he may, and let him remain ever &s;o long a
&s;tranger to his native country; yet &s;till he cannot hin|der
it to be his country, nor make him&s;elf another man,
than nature hath made him by his birth<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 96.&mdash;Hawkins, vol. i. p. 35. No. 7.&mdash;Fo&s;ter, p. 183, 184.</NOTE>. There was a &s;ig|nal
in&s;tance of the application of this doctrine in the ca&s;e of
Angus Macdonald, tried on the 10th December 1747. This
per&s;on was born in Britain, and of Briti&s;h parents; but he had
been carried to France in early infancy, had received his
education there, and had &s;pent his riper years in a profitable
employment in that kingdom, where his property was fixed,
and all his pro&s;pects centered. It was held, that, as a natu|ral
born &s;ubject, he was neverthele&s;s within the law; and
that if in the particular circum&s;tances of his ca&s;e it were a
<PB N="449" REF="450">
hard law, the con&s;titution had provided a re&s;ource in the
royal prerogative of mercy. He was accordingly pardon|ed
upon very favourable terms<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 59. 183, 184.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE local or &s;econdary allegiance again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aliens re&s;ident here owe alle|giance for the time.</NOTE> (but which while
it endures, is no le&s;s binding than the other), obliges equally
an alien as a natural born &s;ubject; and is due to the Sove|reign
by every inhabitant of the land, for the time he con|tinues
in it, by rea&s;on of the protection which he receives
in his per&s;on and effects, from the Sovereign's admini&s;tra|tion
of the government and laws. We have &s;een, that upon
the very &s;ame principle allegiance is even due to an u&s;urper
of the Throne, for the time he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and while by
his exerci&s;e of the Sovereignty he protects the people in the
enjoyment of their rights.</P>
<P>AN alien,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aliens continu|ing here in time of War with their Prince.</NOTE> therefore, living in Britain, if he is an alien
<HI>ami</HI> (according to the phra&s;e of the law of England), that
is the natural born &s;ubject of a State which is in amity with
Britain, &s;hall be dealt with as a traitor, if he commit any
offence which would be trea&s;on in a Briton born. Nor will
it even make any difference in his favour, though his Prince,
who was in amity with Britain at the time of this per&s;on's
fir&s;t &s;ettlement there, &s;hould afterwards come to be an enemy.
His &s;ubject has in that ca&s;e his freedom to withdraw and re|turn
home, and will be allowed the proper time, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
pa&s;ports to that end; and if, after having withdrawn,
he &s;hall again appear in Britain <HI>modo guerino,</HI> in gui&s;e of open
war as an enemy, then indeed he mu&s;t be treated as a com|mon
pri&s;oner of war, if he fall into our hands. But other|wi&s;e,
<PB N="450" REF="451">
&mdash;if he remain in Britain after the commencement of ho|&s;tilities,
living privately as a &s;ubject, and partaking of the be|nefit
of our laws and government, in common with the other
inhabitants of the land; in &s;o doing he continues the owning
of his former local allegiance: he hath made his choice of his
condition and his duty; and mu&s;t be tried as a traitor, if un|der
this cover and protection, he execute or meditate any
thing again&s;t our King, that would be trea&s;on in any of his
natural born &s;ubjects<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 59, 60. 94. 165.&mdash;Fo&s;ter, p. 185. No. 2, 3.&mdash;Hawkins, vol. i. p. 35. No. 5.</NOTE>. Nay it has even been &s;aid, (which
is going a much greater length), that though upon the break|ing
out of war, &s;uch alien &s;hould him&s;elf depart the kingdom;
&s;till his allegiance &s;hall be held to endure, and the trea&s;on
laws to apply to him, if he continues his family and effects
within Great Britain, there to receive the cheri&s;hment and
comfort of the Briti&s;h laws. This, it &s;eems, was the opinion
of all the Judges, when con&s;ulted on the ca&s;e of Tracey
Price and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fo&s;ter, p. 185. No. 4.</NOTE> on the 12th January 1707. The like &s;eems
to be law for an enemy coming hither, and &s;taying here
in time of war, upon the King's letter of &s;afe conduct; for
he is under a &s;pecial protection which puts him in the ca&s;e
of a &s;ubject; in return for which he is bound to ab&s;tain from
all practices again&s;t our King or his government<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, p. 165.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to an alien, who comes into Britain for the fir&s;t time,
after the breaking out of war with his Prince, but who
comes privately and covertly by him&s;elf; &s;uch a one can in
nowi&s;e be regarded as a &s;ubject, but only as a &s;py, and is to
be dealt with according to the laws of war. For coming
hither in time of war, and not as an <HI>open</HI> enemy, yet with|out
<PB N="451" REF="452">
any public commi&s;&s;ion from his own Prince, or any &s;afe
conduct from ours, he is not under the protection of our
laws, either as to per&s;on or effects: on the contrary he is in
a &s;tate of delinquency, and liable to &s;eizure and impri&s;on|ment,
from the day that he &s;ets a foot within this realm<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale vol. i. p. 94.&mdash;Fo&s;ter, p. 187.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to the amba&s;&s;adors of foreign States,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Am|ba&s;&s;adors.</NOTE> they are in a quite
peculiar &s;ituation, and different from that of any other alien.
They are profe&s;&s;edly here as the &s;ervants, and for the pur|po&s;es
of the foreign Prince, and, properly &s;peaking, are un|der
his protection rather than ours. At lea&s;t, what they re|ceive
from us is only of an incidental and &s;ubordinate na|ture;
&s;o that for any offences again&s;t the State, (unle&s;s per|haps
there be an exception in the ca&s;e of a direct attempt
upon the life of the King), they cannot be proceeded again&s;t
as traitors, but as enemies. For murder indeed, and other
atrocious offences that are again&s;t the light of nature, they
are an&s;werable in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice to the laws
of the country where they are; becau&s;e whatever may be
thought of their duties with re&s;pect to the Crown, they are
for the time members of the civil &s;ociety of the inhabitants
of this land, and bound to them by the common ties of hu|manity
as men. But it is true with re&s;pect to other crimes,
what Hale has ob&s;erved, and Fo&s;ter has a&s;&s;ented to, that
&s;uch que&s;tions will always be rather governed by pruden|tial
con&s;iderations and rea&s;ons of State, than by the &s;trict
rules of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 98.&mdash;Fo&s;ter, p. 187.</NOTE></P>
<P>XII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proce&s;s for Trea|&s;on.</NOTE> LET us now attend to the juri&s;diction and manner of trial in ca&s;es of trea&s;on; a matter of great importance, and

which have been occa&s;ioned by the introduction of the law of
England, are perhaps &s;till more con&s;iderable, than tho&s;e in
the nature and de&s;cription of the offence.</P>

<P>A THIRD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial in ab&s;ence for Trea&s;on.</NOTE> and doubtle&s;s a very de&s;irable alteration of the
law, which has en&s;ued upon the &s;tatute of the 7th of Anne,
is the abolition of all trial for trea&s;on in ab&s;ence of the ac|cu&s;ed.
This was no part of our ancient or cu&s;tomary
law, which had invariably required the pre&s;ence of the
pannel; but an innovation made for rea&s;ons of State, in
an arbitrary reign, and at a period of dome&s;tic trouble. This
was after the action with the Covenanters at Pentland Hills,
in November 1666; when the King's &s;ervants for Scotland,
not content with the many victims whom the chance of war
<PB N="454" REF="455">
threw into their hands, had farther judged it material to the
authority of Government, that the e&s;tates of the fugitives
&s;hould be laid hold of, and them&s;elves deterred from continu|ing
in or returning to their country, by the terror of capi|tal
&s;entence, ready for execution upon them, on their being
taken. For this purpo&s;e, recour&s;e was had to a new and extra|ordinary
form of proce&s;s. On the 15th of Augu&s;t 1667, a
libel is called again&s;t William Maxwell of Monreith and
others, (for the mo&s;t part landed men), to the number of 50,
charged either with pre&s;ence in the action at Pentland, or
with ri&s;ing in arms in the we&s;tern counties, or at lea&s;t with
harbouring and a&s;&s;i&s;ting tho&s;e who had ri&s;en. After &s;en|tence
of fugitation pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them in common form, as
non-compearing, the Lord Advocate, Sir John Ni&s;bet of
Dirleton, propo&s;es to the Court to remit the libel to an a&s;|&s;ize;
in order that proof thereof may be taken, and a verdict
found, and doom of death and forfeiture pronounced upon
the pannels if convicted, in the &s;ame manner as if they had
appeared for trial. And to prevail with them in this new
reque&s;t, he produces an opinion of the Judges of the Court
of Se&s;&s;ion, given upon a memorial which he had laid be|fore
them, and bearing that this &s;ort of trial in ab&s;ence for
trea&s;on is a competent and lawful proce&s;s<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;It is their opinion, That upon the Ju&s;tices citation, and &s;ufficient proba|tion taken before the Judge and a&s;&s;ize, they may proceed and pronounce &s;en|tence thereint$ll and forfeiture again&s;t per&s;ons guilty of high trea&s;on, though they be ab&s;ent and cont$$acious.&endq;</NOTE>. The rea&s;ons ur|ged
in the memorial are chiefly the&s;e. 1. The authority of
the Roman law, which as it is in general our highe&s;t autho|rity,
&s;o &s;pecial &s;tatute 1540, c. 69. has declared the Sove|reign's
right to pur&s;ue all &s;ummons of trea&s;on, &startq;conforme
to the <HI>common law,</HI> gude equitie, and rea&s;on.&endq; 2. The
<PB N="455" REF="456">
rea&s;on of the thing it&s;elf; in as much as it is ab&s;urd that the
traitor &s;hould have benefit, and the King be injured by his
contumacy, which is an aggravation of his fault. 3. The
practice of Parliament, who are in the u&s;e of trying for
trea&s;on in ab&s;ence; and who proceed in this way, not in their
legi&s;lative capacity, but as the fountain of ju&s;tice, and the
Supreme Court of the land. 4. The analogy of the practice
of trying traitors after their death, as allowed by the &s;aid
act 1540, c. 69; though the ab&s;ence in that ca&s;e be not con|tumacious,
but nece&s;&s;ary. The&s;e are the arguments which
had prevailed with the Judges of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion to
comply with the de&s;ires of Government on this occa&s;ion, and
to &s;end this legi&s;lative mea&s;ure of the King's mini&s;ters to
their brethren of the Criminal Court, &s;anctified with their
recommendation of it, as a rule of judgment. In deference
to this opinion, the Earl of Athol, Ju&s;tice-General, and Sir
John Home of Renton, the Ju&s;tice-Clerk for the time, toge|ther
with the Earls of Linlithgow and Dumfries, (whom at
their earne&s;t de&s;ire the Privy Council had appointed a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors
to the Court), do accordingly proceed in the trial of certain of
the&s;e pannels &s;elected by the Lord Advocate; and upon convic|tion
they declare them to have forfeited their lands, and ad|judge
them to be executed and demeaned as traitors, at &s;uch
times and places as the Court, upon their being taken, &s;hall
appoint.</P>
<P>IT appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of Trial in Ab&s;ence for Trea&s;on.</NOTE> however, (and &s;urely it is not wonderful), that
the&s;e proceedings were far from meeting with the general ap|probation
of the country. To quiet, therefore, the clamour
of the people, and protect the individuals concerned in this
unprecedented judgment, as well as to obviate the objection
in future ca&s;es of the &s;ame kind; a &s;tatute was thought pro|per
<PB N="456" REF="457">
to be pa&s;&s;ed; the &s;tatute 1669, c. 11. which commends
and ratifies the&s;e &s;entences, approves of the Lord Advocate's
good &s;ervices therein, and be&s;tows power on him and the
Court to proceed in the &s;ame cour&s;e for the future. In
con&s;equence, from that time down to the Revolution, this
&s;ort of proce&s;s was in ordinary practice. It is to be noted,
that while the Judges thus broke down the ancient cu&s;tom
of the realm, by proceeding to trial in ab&s;ence of the ac|cu&s;ed;
they rigidly adhered to the other &s;ide of that &s;ame
cu&s;tom, in refu&s;ing to let any coun&s;el appear, or any defence
be offered, on his behalf.</P>
<P>IT does not appear to have been &s;o early &s;ettled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of Trial in Ab&s;ence for Trea&s;on.</NOTE> that it
was warrantable &s;traightway to proceed to execution, on the
apprehending of the traitor convicted in this extraordinary
cour&s;e. On the 24th March 1679, William Veatch had come
to &s;tand in this hazardous &s;ituation. The Court, unwilling
to decide in &s;o new and &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a que&s;tion, referred the
matter to the Privy Council for their direction and advice.
The King de&s;ires the Council to in&s;truct the Court, to proceed
again&s;t the pri&s;oner according to law. Whereupon the
Court again entreat, and earne&s;tly reque&s;t the advice of the
Privy Council, and of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion; finding, they
&s;ay, no precedent for execution of the&s;e &s;entences in ab|&s;ence,
and e&s;teeming this to be a point of equal importance
and delicacy, as that of the forfeiture in ab&s;ence it&s;elf; and
&s;eeing cau&s;e to follow in this in&s;tance, the laudable cu&s;tom
of their predece&s;&s;ors, who in new and important ca&s;es, did
not proceed without the advice of their &s;uperiors, the Coun|cil,
and of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion. At length, on the 28th
July 1679, they are extricated from this dilemma by a
remi&s;&s;ion. Neverthele&s;s, in the end, this &s;tep al&s;o was ta|ken,
<PB N="457" REF="458">
and at a period too, when any &s;uch proceeding was le&s;s
to be looked for. On the 28th June 1699, Hugh Fra&s;er and
John Fra&s;er, two of the a&s;&s;ociates of Fra&s;er of Beaffort, in
his high and mon&s;trous crimes, and who along with him
had been forfeited in ab&s;ence, on the 6th September 1688,
&startq;being now apprehended and brought before the &s;aid Lords
to hear the time, place and manner of their execution ap|pointed,&endq;
they are, without farther form or proceedings,
ordered to be executed on the 4th of Augu&s;t 1699.</P>
<P>CONTRARY to what might have been expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of Trial in Ab&s;ence for Trea&s;on.</NOTE> this ini|quitous
mode of trial is none of the grievances which
were &s;et forth in the Claim of Right in 1689. Perhaps it
had been thought de&s;irable for the &s;ecurity of the new e&s;ta|bli&s;hment,
to keep the terror of the law hanging over
its adver&s;aries; in which there was thus far the appear|ance
of ju&s;tice, that their own invention was turned again&s;t
them&s;elves. So it is, that the act 1690, c. 31. while it re|&s;$einded
all tho&s;e &s;entences of forfeiture in ab&s;ence which
pa&s;&s;ed before 1669, becau&s;e there was till then no autho|rity
in law for any &s;uch proceedings; and while it re&s;cind|ed
the act 1669 it&s;elf, as far as it ratified tho&s;e particular
forfeitures; yet left the general enactment of that &s;tatute as
to the future &s;tanding and entire. There is accordingly a
noted in&s;tance of trial in ab&s;ence, &s;ince 1690; that of Simon
Fra&s;er of Beaufort (afterwards Lord Lovat) and his a&s;&s;o|ciates,
convicted in September 1698, of a trea&s;onable ri&s;ing
and continuing in arms. But with this one exception, which
was owing probably to the public indignation at the mon|&s;trous
and abominable injuries to a private per&s;on, which ac|companied
that ca&s;e, no u&s;e was made by King William's
mini&s;ters of the high power which the law thus put into
<PB N="458" REF="459">
their hands. In particular, the Earls of Melfort, Midleton,
and Lauderdale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23. 1694</NOTE> along with ninety others, being &s;ummoned
on points of trea&s;on, and failing to appear, were none of
them put to any hard&s;hip beyond the cour&s;e of common
law by fugitation. It was, however, only the &s;tatute of the
7th of Anne, which by communicating the Engli&s;h form of
proce&s;s, and virtually repealing the act 1669, deprived the
pro&s;ecutor, if he &s;hould be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, of all power of
in&s;i&s;ting in &s;uch a proce&s;s. The remedy, therefore, in our
days, again&s;t the danger from known traitors who have e&s;ca|ped
to parts abroad, and who by their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and in|fluence
in the country may be movers of further troubles,
and a means of maintaining di&s;affection to the Government,
lies only where it ought to be; in an application to the ju|&s;tice
and wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;lature for an act of attainder.</P>
<P>ANOTHER cour&s;e of proce&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial for Trea|&s;on after Death.</NOTE> of the &s;ame &s;tamp with the la&s;t,
but of an older date, and which &s;erved accordingly as an argu|ment
for that innovation, was the trial and forfeiture of a
traitor decea&s;ed. This was attempted for the fir&s;t time in 1540,
in the ca&s;e of Robert Le&s;ly; and mainly upon the authority of
the Civil Law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Dig. ad L. Jul. Maj. L. ult.;&mdash;Mack. Ob&s;. on &s;tatutes, p. 136, 137.; Crim. p. 29. No. 22&punc;</NOTE>, which, in the ca&s;e at lea&s;t of proper perduel|lion,

&s;ort of accu&s;ation. The novelty and inju&s;tice of &s;uch
a proceeding, excited, however, &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;content in
the country. Therefore the King, &startq;for &s;tancing of &s;ik mur|mur,&endq;
and meaning (as he tells us) &startq;on nae &s;orte to move
or doe ony thing, bot that hee may ju&s;tlie bee advi&s;ed of

whole E&s;tates of Parliament &startq;all in ane voyce, but variance
and di&s;crepance,&endq; a&s;&s;ented to this new preten&s;ion; and de|clared
his Maje&s;ty's right to in&s;i&s;t in &s;uch actions &startq;conform to
the commoun law, gude equity and rea&s;on, notwith&s;tanding
there is nae &s;pecial law, acte nor provi&s;ion of the realme,
made thereupon of before.&endq; Po&s;itive as this opinion was, it
did not however prove &s;atisfactory to the people at large; and
it was thought proper thus far to comply with their de&s;ires,
that the pro&s;ecution &s;hould only lie within the &s;pace of five
years after the traitor's death, and for &s;uch trea&s;on as had
been notorious in his lifetime. This, which in the main was
agreeable to the Civil Law, was ordered by a &s;tatute of 1542,
which has never been printed. Yet on the 24th June 1609,
&s;entence of forfeiture pa&s;&s;ed in Parliament again&s;t Logan of
Re&s;talrig, for acce&s;&s;ion to the Earl of Gowrie's con&s;piracy; of
which in his lifetime Logan had never been &s;u&s;pected<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See an account of this trial in Arnot's Criminal Ca&s;es, p. 46. <HI>et &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE form of this extraordinary &s;ort of proce&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial for Trea|&s;on after Death.</NOTE> was by cita|tion
of the traitor's heirs; not only as they might defend his
memory, but as they were them&s;elves intere&s;ted to &s;ave
their inheritance from con&s;i&s;cation<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hence, in the proce&s;s of for&s;aulture again&s;t the Duke of Monmouth, we find the Court demurring to proceed, and the diet from time to time continued, be|cau&s;e the Duke's heirs were pri&s;oners at the time, and not in a &s;ituation to de|fend; until &s;uch time as a letter came from the Dutche&s;s naming lawyers for her and her children; who judicially &s;aid that they had no defences to plead.

<PB N="460" REF="461">
render the iniquity of the thing more palpable, the &s;hock|ing
indecency was &s;ometimes u&s;ed, of rai&s;ing the bones of
the decea&s;ed from the grave, and pre&s;enting them at the
bar. This was done, both in Robert Le&s;ly's ca&s;e, and in
that of Logan of R$&s;talrig. Notice may al&s;o be taken of
the proceedings in the ca&s;e of Francis Moubray, in January
1603. This man being killed in his attempt to e&s;cape from
the Ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; his dead body was brought to the
bar, and there had doom pronounced over it, to be hanged and
quartered, and the head and limbs to be &s;tuck up on con|&s;picuous
places of the city.</P>
<P>IT does not appear, that either trial in ab&s;ence or trial after
death was ever attempted to be applied to the &s;tatutory trea|&s;ons
of murder under tru&s;t, theft in landed men, and the
like. Every proceeding of this kind is now excluded by the
communication of the Engli&s;h cour&s;e of proce&s;s; for which
rea&s;on nothing farther &s;hall be added on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>ANOTHER article of moment re&s;pecting trial for trea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Evi|dence in Ca&s;es of Trea&s;on.</NOTE> is
the nature of the evidence on which the pri&s;oner may be con|victed.
Touching this, Mackenzie has &s;aid<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Criminals, Tit. Trea&s;on, No. 21.</NOTE>, that not only per|&s;ons
who would be reckoned inadmi&s;&s;ible as witne&s;&s;es in other
ca&s;es, are freely admitted in trea&s;on, but that one witne&s;&s; is
&s;ufficient to condemn; and for this he appeals to an act of
&s;ederunt of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion in 1591. As, however, no
&s;uch ordinance is to be found in the books of &s;ederunt; &s;o it
is to be hoped, that none to that effect was ever publi&s;hed.
But if in truth &s;uch was ever the practice of the Court; cer|tainly
it was a departure from our ordinary cautious rule of
deci&s;ion, in ju&s;t the very ca&s;e where it was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;a|ry
<PB N="461" REF="462">
to be ob&s;erved. And this our neighbours of England &s;o
well perceived, that notwith&s;tanding their rule for ordinary
crimes, which condemns upon the te&s;timony, if po&s;itive and
creditable, of a &s;ingle witne&s;s, they, by repeated &s;tatutes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">1&s;t Edward VI. c. 12.&mdash;5th and 6th Edward VI. c. 11.&mdash;1&s;t and 2d Philip and Mary, c. 10.</NOTE>,
required two witne&s;&s;es to convict of trea&s;on; except in
ca&s;es of coining and counterfeiting the &s;eals. By the
la&s;t of the&s;e laws, which is &s;tatute 7. William III. c. 3.
it is farther explained and declared, that either there mu&s;t
be two witne&s;&s;es to the &s;ame overt act of trea&s;on; or if
they &s;wear to different acts, the&s;e mu&s;t be acts of the &s;ame
&s;ort of trea&s;on, &s;o as in &s;ome mea&s;ure to cohere, and &s;trength|en
each other<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>This &s;eems to have been law even before the &s;tatute of William. Thus, in the trial of Ireland, Groves, and Pickering, (December 17. 1678,) for con&s;pi|ring to kill the King, the Chief-Ju&s;tice laid it down: &startq;For if killing the King be the fact in que&s;tion, and one per&s;on proves they would do it by one thing, and another by another, and one in one place, and another in another; yet the&s;e are two witne&s;&s;es to prove one fact, that is the &s;ub&s;tance, which is the killing of the King.&endq; St. Trials, vol. ii. p. 714. In like manner, in the conference of the Judges preparatory to the trial of the regicides, it was re&s;olved, &startq;That there need not be two witne&s;&s;es to prove every act tending to the com|pa&s;&s;ing of the King's death. But one witne&s;s, to prove one overt act tending to the compa&s;&s;ing of the King's death, and another witne&s;s to prove another act tending to the &s;ame end, are &s;ufficient. For compa&s;&s;ing the King's death is trea&s;on. And then, if two &s;everal witne&s;&s;es prove two &s;everal acts tending to compa&s;&s;ing the King's death, the trea&s;on is proved by two witne&s;&s;es; as the law in ca&s;e of trea&s;on requires.&endq; St. Trials, vol. iii. p. 303.</P>
<P>The &s;ame opinion was given by all the Judges in the trial of Lord Stafford. St. Trials, vol. ii. p. 204, 205.</P></NOTE>. Thus, if one witne&s;s &s;wear that a letter was
written to provide arms for attempting the King's life, and
another that the pri&s;oner lay in wait to kill the King; both
the&s;e overt acts of compa&s;&s;ing the King's death are &s;ufficient|ly
<PB N="462" REF="463">
proved. But if one &s;wear that the pri&s;oner lay in wait to kill
the King, and another, that he crui&s;ed at &s;ea, under an enemy's
commi&s;&s;ion; the&s;e two acts are neither of them proved; be|cau&s;e
the one is an act of compa&s;&s;ing the King's death, the other
an act of adherence to his enemies<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 235, 236, 237.&mdash;Hawkins, vol. ii. p. 428. No. 2.&mdash;See the ca&s;e of Vaughan, St. Trials, vol. v. p. 38.</NOTE>.
It is, however, only
with re&s;pect to the overt acts charged in the indictment, that
the &s;tatute has laid down this rule.
In regard to other and
extrin&s;ic circum&s;tances, which are not evidence of any overt
act, nor &s;o laid in the indictment, the&s;e are &s;till open to be
proved by a &s;ingle witne&s;s, according to the common law of
England.
For in&s;tance, that the pri&s;oner is a native born
&s;ubject, and not an alien; this is a circum&s;tance, which though
material to the trea&s;on, may be proved by one witne&s;s; be|ing
neither it&s;elf an overt act, nor any wi&s;e &s;ub&s;ervient to the
proof of any that is charged<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 240.&mdash;Ca&s;e of Vaughan, St. Trials, vol. v.</NOTE>.
As far, however, as relates
to the charge of the overt acts, the &s;tatute of William equally
regulates the evidence that is given upon the bill, towards the
indictment, as that which is given upon the trial it&s;elf<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 232, 233.</NOTE>.</P>

in repeating this provi&s;ion, has farther de&s;cribed the con|fe&s;&s;ion
as that which is made &startq;in open court.&endq; Under which
words, according to the opinion of Hawkins and Fo&s;ter, no

that under the law as it now &s;tands, no u&s;e can be made of
violence or torture, to move the pri&s;oner to an accu&s;ation
either of him&s;elf or others. The practice in Scotland, as
in mo&s;t other countries of Europe, had been, to have re|cour&s;e

<P>THE act of William has farther &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Evidence mu&s;t be of the overt Acts libelled.</NOTE>&startq;that no evidence
&s;hall be admitted or given of any overt act, which is not
expre&s;sly laid in the indictment.&endq; The meaning of this

of any po&s;itive injunction, but nece&s;&s;ary perhaps to be guarded
in the ca&s;e of State pro&s;ecutions), which confines the proof
to the heads and charges &s;et forth in the indictment; upon
which alone the pri&s;oner comes prepared for his defence. One
who is indicted for compa&s;&s;ing the King's death, in as much as
he lay in wait to kill the King, cannot therefore be convicted
on proof, (nor will any &s;uch proof be taken nor allowed), that
he gave money to another to make the attempt to kill the
King at a different time and place. For though both be overt
acts of trea&s;on, and of the &s;ame &s;ort of trea&s;on; and though
both, if duly laid in the indictment, would be admitted to
<PB N="465" REF="466">
proof (&s;ince there is no limitation of the number of overt
acts that may be laid); yet they are di&s;tinct and indepen|dent
charges, which may require quite different cour&s;es
of defence, on the part of the accu&s;ed. It is this and
not any rea&s;on of form, that is the &s;ub&s;tantial ground
of the rule; which is therefore carried no greater length
than the&s;e con&s;iderations require. Whereby, if the circum|&s;tance
offered to be proved, though not laid in the in|dictment,
be however nearly connected with the overt act
which is laid, and goes directly to e&s;tabli&s;h it, this, without
a doubt, may be given in evidence: for it bears upon the
very charge to which the pri&s;oner's attention has been called;
and no indictment can be expected to &s;et forth (nor is there
any law nor practice for it in other ca&s;es), the whole detail
of circum&s;tances and pre&s;umptions, from which the truth
of the libelled charge may appear or be made out<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the ca&s;e of Francis Francia, January 22. 1716, one of the overt acts laid was his writing &s;everal letters to per&s;ons in France, declaring his purpo&s;e of en|gaging in a rebellion, and &s;oliciting a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards it. In evidence of this, it was offered to produce the an&s;wers to the&s;e letters, received by him from his French corre&s;pondents. It was objected, that every one of the&s;e an&s;wers, was it|&s;elf al&s;o an overt act, and that the words of them not being &s;et forth in the in|dictment, they could not be given in evidence. But this objection was over|ruled, and the letters admitted. The Chief Baron &s;aid, &startq;None can &s;ay that here is not an overt act expre&s;sly laid.

in the trial of Ambro&s;e Rockwood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 21. 1696.</NOTE> the&s;e were two of the
<PB N="466" REF="467">
overt acts laid in the indictment; that he and others had
con&s;ulted on the means of way-laying the King, and that
they agreed to provide forty men for that purpo&s;e. In evi|dence
of the&s;e it was offered, and after con&s;ultation was al|lowed
to be proved, that Rockwood &s;howed to one of the
con&s;pirators, a li&s;t of a certain number who were to join in
the attempt, at the head of which li&s;t &s;tood his own name as
their leader. It was plain that this circum&s;tance went di|rectly
to prove the overt acts which were laid, viz. the de|liberation
to way-lay the King, and to provide a party for that
end<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 245, 246.&mdash;Hawkins, vol. ii. p. 436. No. 34. St. Tr. vol. iv.</NOTE>. The benefit therefore of the &s;tatute lies in this, that
contrary to the older practice in ca&s;es of trea&s;on, an overt
act not laid in the indictment, and which has no relation to
the overt act that is laid, cannot be given in evidence; where|as
by the older practice it might have been given, if both
overt acts were of the &s;ame &s;ort of trea&s;on. Farther; though
the circum&s;tances relative to the overt act libelled be of
that nature, that they might them&s;elves have been laid as
overt acts in the indictment; yet, if being admitted to proof,
they do not fully e&s;tabli&s;h the very overt act that is libelled,
certainly no regard can be paid to them, and the pri&s;oner
mu&s;t be acquitted.</P>
<P>IN the article next to be taken notice of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Service of In|dictment for Trea&s;on.</NOTE> the practice of
England has been reformed by po&s;itive &s;tatutes, after the re|&s;emblance
of the <HI>common law</HI> of Scotland; and at the &s;ame
time, the exception of ca&s;es of trea&s;on from our ordina|ry
rule, has very properly been taken away. It is the
general direction of the Scotti&s;h practice for citation of
the accu&s;ed, whether a pri&s;oner or at large, that he be
<PB N="467" REF="468">
called on 15 days <HI>induciae;</HI> and be &s;erved at the &s;ame time
with a copy of the libel, and of the li&s;ts of jurymen and
witne&s;&s;es who are to pa&s;s upon his trial. But it appears from
the trial (among many that might be mentioned) of Fran|cis
Tenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 8. 1600. Dec. 3. 1684.</NOTE> and of Baillie of
Jervi&s;wood, that in the ca&s;e
of crimes again&s;t the State, &s;o far was this equitable cu&s;tom
from being uniformly ob&s;erved, that the pannel was &s;ome|times
brought to the bar, upon no longer notice than 24
hours; and e&s;pecially this was allowed, if, as in Jervi&s;|wood's

<P>The &s;ame objection had been made and overruled in the ca&s;e of James Finlay, and thirty-two per&s;ons more, (November 10. 1679), who had only been allowed about &s;ixteen hours after &s;ervice of their libels.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e al&s;o of Patrick Earl of Orkney, (February 1. 1615), where the libel was long, and bore a variety of charges, it appears that no copy of it was ever given him. And on pleading the objection at the bar, he was allowed half an hour to con&s;ult with his coun&s;el, <HI>ex &s;peciali gratia.</HI></P></NOTE>, the pannel were in gaol at the time of citation.
This irregularity was at length &s;anctified by an expre&s;s &s;ta|tute,
1685, c. 3. (&s;ugge&s;ted probably by the complaints that
were made of the proceedings in that very trial), which,
while it ratified what had been done in former ca&s;es, extend|ed
however the <HI>inducia</HI> to 48 hours, as well as authori&s;ed
a farther delay, if the pri&s;oner applied for exculpation.
Now, &s;o different are the views which have been taken of this
matter in the neighbouring kingdom, that whereas, by the
cour&s;e of their practice in ordinary ca&s;es, the pri&s;oner has no
right to &s;ee his indictment, and much le&s;s the li&s;t of witne&s;&s;es or

after a certain period therein mentioned, and long ago ex|pired,
the <HI>induciae</HI> for &s;ervice of the copy of indictment are

of the inconvenience which might attend them in the

has &s;ince been obviated by the &s;tatute 6. Geo. III.
c. 53. which repeals the act of Anne, as far as it relates to
that cla&s;s of trea&s;ons.</P>
<P>IN the following articles al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pri&s;oner's Wit|ne&s;&s;es, to be ci|ted and &s;worn.</NOTE> the practice of Scotland
has long been familiar with tho&s;e equitable rules, which
have only found admi&s;&s;ion into the Engli&s;h proce&s;s of trea|&s;on
in virtue of modern &s;tatutes, and in derogation of
their common law. By &s;tatute 7. William III. c. 3. the
pri&s;oner is to have the aid of the like proce&s;s of Court, as
the pro&s;ecutor, for compelling his witne&s;&s;es to appear. By

on his de&s;ire, &s;hall have coun&s;el a&s;&s;igned him by the
Court, to examine the witne&s;&s;es, and take charge of his de|fence:

unle&s;s to plead &s;ome point of law, which the Court de&s;ire to
have con&s;idered.</P>
<P>To conclude;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limitation of Proce&s;s. Per|emptory chal|lenge.</NOTE> this change of our &s;y&s;tem of trea&s;on law has

King's life by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination or otherwi&s;e, the indictment for
trea&s;on mu&s;t be found by the grand jury, within three
years after the offence. This was provided by the &s;aid act
of William. Moreover, the pri&s;oner now enjoys, as by the
common law of England, that which no per&s;on has right to
upon his trial in Scotland for any other crime, the benefit
of a peremptory challenge to the jurors, to the number of
thirty-five.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Black&s;t. vol. iv. p. 347.&mdash;Hawkins, vol. ii. p. 414. No. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>XIII. WE have now reached the la&s;t article in the doc|trine
of trea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Judgment for Trea&s;on.</NOTE> the judgment that attends it on conviction;
which is, as to the per&s;on of the offender, judgment of death,
accompanied with &s;uch circum&s;tances of rigor in the way
of execution, and of indignity to the dead body, as may be
&s;uppo&s;ed to affect the &s;pectators with terror, or to mark the
public contempt and dete&s;tation of the traitor. He is to
be drawn to the gallows on a &s;ledge or hurdle<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This was part of the &s;entence by the law of Scotland. See the &s;entence upon John Ma&s;ter of Forbes, July 14. 1537.</NOTE>; he is to be

are to be taken out, and burned while he is yet alive; his
head is to be cut off and his body divided into four
quarters; and the head and quarters are to be at the King's
di&s;po&s;al. In the ca&s;e of a woman offender, in order to
avoid the&s;e &s;hocking indecencies, (which however have
been generally di&s;pen&s;ed with by the royal mercy even in the
ca&s;e of men), the &s;entence is, that &s;he be drawn to the gal|lows,
and burned alive<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was the doom in the ca&s;e of Janet Douglas, Lady Glamy&s;s, July 17. 1537.</NOTE>. Trea&s;onable offenders again&s;t the

than in the &s;ub&s;tance of their offence, are more mildly dealt
with if they are males; being drawn to the gallows, and
hanged till they be dead. But, by a &s;trange di&s;tinction, a

e&s;tate to the Crown, for him and his heirs for ever: a con|&s;equence,
which, as far as relates to Scotland, is peculiar to
the crime of trea&s;on, but is an ancient part of our common
law re&s;pecting that crime; and &s;eems to have held at a very
ancient period, when the e&s;cheat, in all other in&s;tances of
delict, was not to the Crown, but to the &s;uperior of the
lands<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">In the ca&s;e of trea&s;on, committed by adherence to the Pretender, or corre|&s;pondence with him, the Sovereign, by &s;tatute 1&s;t, George 1. c. 20. commonly called the <HI>Clan Act,</HI> departed from the emoluments of forfeiture with re&s;pect to lands held of &s;ubjects &s;uperior, in the view of rewarding &s;uch &s;uperiors or others, as &s;hould continue faithful in their duty. 1. If a va&s;&s;al holding of a &s;ubject were at|tainted of trea&s;on, his lands were to recogno&s;ce to the &s;uperior, continuing in his duty, and to remain with him for ever, in the &s;ame manner as i&s; re&s;igned, <HI>ad|perpetuam remanentiam.</HI> 2. In ca&s;e of the attainder of a tack&s;man, his right was to fall, and the tenement, together with the &s;ingle and liferent e&s;cheat of &s;uch tenant, to be enjoyed by the landlord, the author of his right, continuing in his allegiance. 3.

<P><PB N="471" REF="472">
THIS ab&s;olute and perpetual forfeiture is, however, by the
law as it now &s;tands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forfeiture of entailed E&s;tates.</NOTE> only in the ca&s;e of an e&s;tate in &s;ee|&s;imple,
where the one and entire intere&s;t in the e&s;tate is
ve&s;ted in the traitor;. According to the native principles
of the law of Scotland, there was no room for any more
favourable con&s;truction of the forfeiture even in the ca&s;e of
a tailzied fee, or entailed e&s;tate. For in the e&s;timation of
our practice, every &s;ub&s;titute in the tailzie, when he &s;uc|ceeds,
is no other than an <HI>heir;</HI> who takes by <HI>inheritance,</HI>
of and through tho&s;e who are called before him, and by
the proper forms of title as in a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> the very &s;ame e&s;tate
of &s;ee, which has been ve&s;ted in tho&s;e prior and more &s;avour|ed
per&s;ons. As al&s;o, it is not conceived with us. that before
&s;ucceeding, the heir of tailzie has in him any actual or real
e&s;tate of his own, di&s;tinct from that of the pre&s;ent owner; but
only a pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding guarded by extraordinary pro|vi&s;ions,
and which the law accommodates him with peculiar
expedients to enforce and maintain. In conformity to this
principle, the act 1685, c. 22. which fir&s;t regulated the mat|ter
of tailzies, was guarded with an expre&s;s provi&s;ion &s;aving
his Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t &startq;in all confi&s;cations or other fines, as
<PB N="472" REF="473">
&startq;the puni&s;hment of crimes.&endq; At the Revolution however
among other popular laws then pa&s;&s;ed, with the view of con|ciliating
the people to the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, was the act
1690. c. 33.; which declared in &s;ub&s;tance, that no heir of
entail &s;hould be prejudged by the forfeiture of his prede|ce&s;&s;or,
except in as far as the traitor had power to contract
debt or affect the lands, by the quality of his right; if the
tailzie were duly completed by in&s;ertion in the record. This
then was the &s;tate of things at the Union; when by the act
of Anne, (and it is &s;aid after a &s;evere &s;truggle in the Hou&s;e
of Lords<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Black&s;tone, vol. iv. p. 376, 377.</NOTE>), per&s;ons convicted of trea&s;on in this country
were made liable to the &s;ame corruption of blood, pains,
penalties and forfeitures, as per&s;ons convicted of that crime
in England.</P>
<P>Now in England, all e&s;tates of inheritance had been made
liable to forfeiture, by &s;tatute 26. Henry VIII. c. 13. in
virtue of which, the traitor forfeits for him&s;elf and his
heirs. But, on the other &s;ide, according to the notion of
an Engli&s;h entail, with <HI>remainders over</HI> as they are termed,
which in point of <HI>legal de&s;cription,</HI> are the neare&s;t thing to
our <HI>conditional in&s;titutions,</HI> the e&s;tate or fee is held to be
broken into parts; whereof that which belongs to the re|mainder-man,
(or &s;ub&s;titute heir as we &s;hould call him),
is di&s;tinct from the intere&s;t of the pre&s;ent tenant in tail,
or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the e&s;tate, and his heirs, and appertains
to him in his own proper and original, though even|tual
right; and cannot therefore be forfeited nor lo&s;t to
him by the trea&s;on or delict of any other per&s;on. In pur&s;u|ance,
therefore, of the object of the &s;tatute of Anne, which
was to bring the forfeitures and puni&s;hments of trea&s;on as
near as may be to an agreement throughout the united king|doms;
<PB N="473" REF="474">
the &s;ub&s;titute heir has been held to be a remain|der-man,
and this analogy has been a&s;&s;umed as the ground
of deci&s;ion with re&s;pect to the extent of the forfeiture of
a Scots entailed e&s;tate. The judgment of the Hou&s;e of Lords
upon that matter in the ca&s;e of Gordon of Park was, that
the e&s;tate forfeited for the life of Sir William Gordon, the
traitor and pre&s;ent tenant, and during the life of his i&s;&s;ue|male.
called as &s;uch to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by the tailzie; and that
on extinction of the&s;e, it would revert from the Crown to the
next &s;ub&s;titute (or remainder-man) Captain John Gordon, as
called by the tailzie, failing Sir William's i&s;&s;ue-male, under
the de&s;cription of heir-male of the body of Sir James Gordon
the entailer<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Falconer's Deci&s;ions, November 16. 1750, Captain Gordon <HI>contra</HI> King's Advocate. Kames's Elacidations, art. 42.</NOTE>. That is to &s;ay, the intere&s;t of this next order or
cla&s;s of &s;ub&s;titutes was to be viewed as a new acqui&s;ition, or
&s;eparate e&s;tate from that of the offender and his i&s;&s;ue male.
Even this limitation of the forfeiture will, however, only
hold in the ca&s;e of &s;uch tailzies as are duly completed by
entry on record, in terms of the &s;tatute 1685. For that
circum&s;tance is a nece&s;&s;ary qualification to the benefit of
the &s;tatute, and for taking the e&s;tate out of the ca&s;e of a
fee &s;imple; which, as the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or may effectually alienate
or incumber by his deed, &s;o mu&s;t it ab&s;olutely and entirely
forfeit by his crime.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falconer, vol. ii. No. 178.</NOTE> Judgment was given to that effect, in

that though the traitor have contravened the tailzie before

ju&s;t; that though the attainder give ri&s;e to this emolument,

or as part of the e&s;tate of the traitor, who never
had any right therein; but by the e&s;cheat of <HI>ultimus baeres</HI> or
as <HI>bona vacantia,</HI> which the King claims, becau&s;e during the
life of the traitor, who is the neare&s;t heir, no other per&s;on
can have them. But it appears that in this &s;ituation, the
e&s;cheat by the law of England is not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blak&s;tone, b. 2. c. 1$. v. ii. p. 253.</NOTE> as it was with us, to the
King, but to the lord of the fee. Hence ari&s;es a que|&s;tion,
<PB N="476" REF="477">
whether in this article we are to be ruled by the law
of England, or by our ancient cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on of doubt &s;eems to lie in this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If regulated by the Scots or En|gli&s;h Law.</NOTE>&mdash;that the only
thing meant to be regulated and brought to an uniformity
by the act of Anne, is the puni&s;hment of the traitor and his
race; and that the&s;e per&s;ons equally &s;uffer the forfeiture of
their property, whether the tenement forfeit to the King, or
e&s;cheat to the &s;uperior. But it may be an&s;wered, that from
this there would in the end re&s;ult a difference of the
condition of the forfeiture &s;u&s;tained by the traitor in the
two parts of the realm. For if the tenement goes to the
Crown; then can the King, who&s;e intere&s;t is alone concern|ed
in that ca&s;e, re&s;tore the e&s;tate to the traitor, and rein|&s;tate
him in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: whereas over the intere&s;t of the
&s;uperior, if it e&s;cheats to him, the King, by the law of
England, has confe&s;&s;edly no &s;uch power. It is to be ob&s;er|ved
too, that in other matters, as for in&s;tance with re&s;pect
to the intere&s;t of creditors, the act of Anne has already
been con&s;trued to intend a more exten&s;ive alteration of the
law, &s;uch as applies the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem, as far as may be, to
all the relative and &s;ubordinate portions of doctrine.</P>
<P>BY the law of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forfeiture at|taches at the Date of the Trea&s;on.</NOTE> the forfeiture relates backwards
to the time of the trea&s;on, &s;o as to annul all interme|diate

down in the Scots act 1690, c. 33. it has however, on occa|&s;ion

of conviction of any felony, is what they term the corrup|tion
of the traitor's blood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vol. ii. p. 254, 255.</NOTE> Whereby, as Black&s;tone ex|pre&s;&s;es
it, &startq;the channel which conveyed the hereditary blood
from his ance&s;tors to him, is not only exhau&s;ted for the pre|&s;ent,
but is totally dammed up, and rendered impervious
for the future.&endq; He cannot, therefore, after attainder, (&s;up|po&s;ing
him to e&s;cape execution), &s;ucceed as heir to any one;
nor can his po&s;terity, nor any other per&s;on inherit any thing
<HI>of</HI> him, nor even of any other per&s;on <HI>through</HI> him, if the
de&s;cent mu&s;t be connected in that way, and with mention of
him as a link in the chain of conveyance. Thus, if John,
the elde&s;t &s;on of James, is convicted of trea&s;on in his fa|ther's
lifetime, and is executed, and leaves a &s;on, George;
this per&s;on, though he may take by direct &s;ettlement made by
his grandfather in his favour, (becau&s;e no crime committed by
John can le&s;&s;en the powers of James over his own property);
yet he cannot inherit of his grandfather, in cour&s;e of law.
For in &s;erving heir, he mu&s;t connect his propinquity through
his father John, who&s;e blood has lo&s;t the power of forming
a relation, as to this matter of inheritance. Nor is this to
be under&s;tood as true of the traitor's lineal de&s;cendents
only; but equally of all, who either upwards or collaterally,
<PB N="480" REF="481">
have occa&s;ion to trace their connection through his per|&s;on.
Thus, if there be two brothers, and one of them be at|tainted
of trea&s;on, and the &s;on of this per&s;on afterwards
purcha&s;e lands, and die without i&s;&s;ue; his uncle cannot
inherit the&s;e lands: becau&s;e they are related through the
attainted per&s;on<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 2. c. 49. No. 49.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falconer, vol. ii. No. 171.</NOTE> This principle was applied with us in
the ca&s;e of the King <HI>contra</HI> Lundin, December 13. 1750.
On the other &s;ide, where the attainted per&s;on is not nece&s;&s;ary
to be mentioned in tracing the de&s;cent from the decea&s;ed
to the heir claiming; there the corruption of blood is no
ob&s;tacle to the inheritance. Thus, if the &s;on of one who
was attainted &s;hall purcha&s;e land, and have a &s;on, and die;
this &s;on &s;hall inherit of him; becau&s;e he derives his de&s;cent
immediately from him. Or if a man have two &s;ons, and
then be attainted, and one of the &s;ons purcha&s;e lands, and
die without i&s;&s;ue; the other &s;hall be his heir; becau&s;e he
may make up his title without mentioning the father<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 2. c. 49. No. 49.</NOTE> Nay,

<P><PB N="481" REF="482">
ANOTHER thing to be ob&s;erved of the corruption of blood,
and which &s;erves not a little to increa&s;e the hard&s;hip of that
penalty is, that even a royal pardon will not cure it.
The bodily pains his Maje&s;ty may remit, and re&s;tore the
offender again&s;t the <HI>forfeiture,</HI> wherein only the royal in|tere&s;t
is concerned; but over the corruption of blood he
has no power, by rea&s;on of the intere&s;t which thence ari&s;es
to a third per&s;on, the lord of the fee. If therefore a man
have a &s;on, and be attainted, and afterwards pardoned, this
&s;on &s;hall neverthele&s;s not inherit of him, nor of any per&s;on
through him; but &s;hall give way to the lord of the fee, in a
que&s;tion with whom, his blood, being once corrupted, conti|nues
to be &s;o for ever. But if that &s;on had died, and another
been begotten after the pardon, this other would have &s;uc|ceeded;
becau&s;e by the pardon the father is as it were a new
creature, and regains the capacity of conveying inheritable
blood to his i&s;&s;ue. The only way, therefore, of completely
&s;alving an attainder, is by an act of the Legi&s;lature<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">Black&s;t. b. 2. c. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONLY two things more &s;hall be ob&s;erved. 1. With re|&s;pect
to tho&s;e trea&s;ons which relate to the Papal &s;upre|macy,
or the counterfeiting the coin$f the kingdom;
this con&s;equence of attainder is &s;aved by the &s;tatutes which
create them. 2. By the &s;tatute 7. Anne, c. 21. neither
the corruption of blood, nor even the total forfeiture of
lands, is a perpetual con&s;equence of attainder, but for the
period only of the then Pretender's life; which has &s;ince,
by &s;tatute 17. Geo. II. c. 39. been extended to the lifetime
al&s;o of the Pretender's &s;ons. After the death of tho&s;e per|&s;ons,
no attainder for trea&s;on &s;hall be to the di&s;inheriting of
any heir, nor to the prejudice of any right or title, other
than that of the offender him&s;elf during his natural life.</P>

<P>THE rea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why Sedition is a Point of Dittay.</NOTE> in all the&s;e ca&s;es, is the &s;ame; that mea&s;ures

them with jealou&s;y, and di&s;like of the e&s;tabli&s;hed or|der
of the State, tend directly to a breach between Sovereign
and &s;ubject, and to fill the realm with trouble and di&s;&s;en&s;ion.
Which mi&s;erable calamity to prepare, can no more be doubted
to be a cogni&s;able crime, and one too of a high degree, than
that it is a crime to partake of the very mea&s;ures them&s;elves
of re&s;it&s;tance and violence (if &s;uch follow), to which the&s;e
exhortations have &s;educed. For it would be again&s;t all rea|&s;on
and policy to believe, that the Government of any coun|try
mu&s;t knowingly &s;uffer the wicked project of its own &s;ub|ver&s;ion,
to be contrived, improved, and matured; and can
only then interpo&s;e when the conflagration has &s;pread, and
the de&s;truction of the fabric can no longer be prevented.
Such a po&s;ition amounts indeed to nothing le&s;s than this,
(&s;urely too ab&s;urd to need a refutation), that there may be a

Sovereign without &s;ubjects, a law without an obligation,
and a Government without allegiance.</P>
<P>THIS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sedition is a Crime at Com|mon Law.</NOTE> therefore, of &s;edition is a crime, whereof the no|tion
is coeval in all countries with the in&s;titution of regular
government; and ari&s;es directly out of the &s;ituation it&s;elf,
by the force of rea&s;on and nece&s;&s;ity, without the aid of any
po&s;itive act or promulgation of the Legi&s;lature, pointing out
&s;uch practices as the &s;ubject of pro&s;ecution. So that even
if our &s;tatute-book were &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, and no in&s;tance
had occurred in pa&s;t times of puni&s;hment inflicted on tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors

in applying a &s;uitable correction to &s;o pernicious a crime,
which cannot be left unpuni&s;hed, without betraying the
people to mi&s;ery, and the law and Government to de&s;truc|tion.
We have already, more than once, in the cour&s;e of
our inquiries, had occa&s;ion to take notice of the applica|tion
of this &s;alutary principle with re&s;pect to tho&s;e crimes,
which are only to the injury of individuals; and much

<P>ONE in particular de&s;erves to be attended to; I mean the
act 1584, c. 130. which proceeds upon the narrative, that
the power, dignity and authority of Parliament had of
late years been called in &s;ome doubt; at lea&s;t that &s;ome
had curiou&s;ly travelled to introduce innovations with re&s;pect
to it. Therefore, it &s;tatutes and ordains, &startq;that naine of

prerogative of calling, holding, proroguing or di&s;&s;ol|ving
Parliament, and of con&s;enting to the acts of the other

is made by the act 1685, c. 5. with re&s;pect to the giving or
taking of the Solemn League and Covenant, or writing in
defence of it, or owning it as an obligatory compact.</P>
<P><PB N="489" REF="490">
SOME of the&s;e are indeed the laws of arbitrary times;
but the principle which they enforce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Was made Trea|&s;on
in certain Ca&s;es.</NOTE> that of maintain|ing
the obligation and authority of the exi&s;ting Govern|ment,
is a principle of all times and &s;ituations; and is ac|cordingly
adopted and applied in the &s;tatutes next to be
mentioned, which were made for the &s;ecurity of a Prote|&s;tant
Prince, and of the free &s;ettlement at the Revolution.
The very fir&s;t &s;tatute of the fir&s;t Parliament of William and
Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689, c. 1.</NOTE> anxiou&s;ly provides again&s;t all challenge of the power
and authority by which the Crown had been &s;ettled on tho&s;e
per&s;onages; and in this view it declares, &startq;That it &s;hall be
high trea&s;on for any per&s;ons to di&s;own, quarrel or impugn
the dignity or authority of this Parliament, upon any
pretext whatever.&endq; And this example is followed by
Queen Anne's fir&s;t Parliament, who by the act 1703, c. 3.
ratify the &s;aid &s;tatute of William and Mary, and farther
declare, &startq;That it &s;hall be trea&s;on in any of the &s;ubjects of

<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are not Trea|&s;on &s;ince the Union.</NOTE> each of the&s;e enactments, in its order, is an acknow|ledgment
and confirmation of the doctrine of the common law;
proceeding as they do upon the notion of the wickedne&s;s of all
&s;uch practices which tend to impugn the principles, and &s;hake
the &s;ecurity of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Government, or to withdraw
from it the reverence and affections of the people; and

and quality as acts of &s;edition at common law; whereby
the offenders are ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to the highe&s;t arbitrary pu|ni&s;hment.
On the&s;e grounds, many convictions have of
late years been obtained. For, by a &s;trange fatality, it
has been re&s;erved for a &s;ea&s;on of the mo&s;t perfect free|dom,
and unrivalled pro&s;perity, to in&s;truct us in the fuller
knowledge of the&s;e pernicious di&s;orders; and to fill our re|cords
with trials for mutiny and di&s;affection, of &s;uch a
kind as was utterly unknown in former times, when our fore|fathers
laboured under real grievances and oppre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>ON the 8th of January 1793,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Sedition.</NOTE> three young men, Morton,
Ander&s;on, and Craig, were convicted of attempting to rai&s;e
di&s;content in the minds of his Maje&s;ty's &s;oldiers, and
&s;educe them from their duty; and of propo&s;ing to them to
drink a di&s;loyal and &s;editious toa&s;t. They had &s;entence
of impri&s;onment for eleven months. On the 18th March
1793, &s;entence of impri&s;onment was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed upon Ro|bert&s;on
and Berry, book&s;ellers, for printing and publi&s;hing
a pamphlet, which in gro&s;s terms traduced the whole frame
and exerci&s;e of the Briti&s;h Government, as a &s;y&s;tem of ve|nality
and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>NEXT to this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Sedition.</NOTE> was the ca&s;e of Thomas Muir, advocate; who
was tried on a charge of uttering &s;editious &s;peeches, cir|culating
&s;editious publications, and forming a&s;&s;ociations,
for the purpo&s;e of con&s;training, and accompli&s;hing, of their
<PB N="491" REF="492">
own authority, an alteration of the Government of this
country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 31. 1793.</NOTE> He was convicted, and adjudged to be tran&s;port|ed
for fourteen years. Likewi&s;e, &s;entence of tran&s;portation
for the term of &s;even years, was given at Perth, on the 13th
September 1793, by the Judges on the Circuit, in the ca&s;e of
Thomas Fi&s;che Palmer. This man was convicted of publi&s;h|ing
a hand-bill, which de&s;cribed the King and Parliament
as in a league to en&s;lave the country, and exhorted them to
combine and take deci&s;ive mea&s;ures in their own defence.
The&s;e were followed, in the &s;ucceeding year, with the con|victions
of William Skirving,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 6. &amp; 7. 1794.</NOTE> Maurice Margarot, and Jo&s;eph
Gerald,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 13. &amp; 14. 1794.</NOTE> for their &s;everal parts and proceedings in the coun|cil
termed the Briti&s;h Convention;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 13. &amp; 14. 1794.</NOTE> an a&s;&s;embly which ar|rogated
to it&s;elf the character of repre&s;entatives of the in|habitants
of Great Britain, and in that capacity took mea|&s;ures
for debauching the affections of the people, as well as
to defy the Legi&s;lature, and re&s;i&s;t any attempt which might
be made by &s;tatute or otherwi&s;e, to &s;uppre&s;s them. All
the&s;e per&s;ons had &s;entence of tran&s;portation for fourteen
years. In England, on the like grounds, &s;entence of impri|&s;onment
pa&s;&s;ed on the venders of the work entitled <HI>The
Rights of Man;</HI> and in many ca&s;es of &s;editious words ut|tered,
or &s;editious hand-bills circulated among the people.
In the end, with the increa&s;e of this alarming evil, to which
the powers of the common law of England were found to be
unequal, recour&s;e was at length had to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
Legi&s;lature, who by &s;tatute 36th Geo. III. c. 7. authori&s;ed
the inflicting of the &s;ame puni&s;hments, that are competent in
Scotland according to the common law; and by means of
which, duly and &s;teadily applied by the Scots Judges, the
growing audacity of the licentious in this quarter of the
kingdom, had in a great mea&s;ure been repre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="493">
THE information which has thus by dear experience been
purcha&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Real Sedition and Riot are different.</NOTE> and which is now &s;o exten&s;ively diffu&s;ed by means
of the many printed trials, hinders me to enlarge farther
on a &s;ubject, how important and intere&s;ting &s;oever in it&s;elf,
where I cannot hope to add materially to the &s;tock of know|ledge,
of which the public are already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This
ob&s;ervation, however, may be fit to be &s;ubjoined, that the
divi&s;ion which Er&s;kine has made of &s;edition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. Crimes, No. 29.</NOTE> into verbal
and real, does not &s;eem to be a ju&s;t divi&s;ion; that is, accord|ing
to the de&s;cription which he has given of tho&s;e two
modes of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. In his account of real &s;edition,
that author in &s;ome mea&s;ure confounds it with the crime of
riot or convocation of the lieges; in as much as he holds it
to be committed, (at lea&s;t if this is not his meaning, his ex|pre&s;&s;ions
are inaccurate), by an actual commotion only, or
breach of the peace. But truly the two offences differ in
more articles than one. <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> Becau&s;e an indictment may
be maintained for real &s;edition, as in all the in&s;tances al|ready
quoted, though no manner of tumult or violence have
taken place. For the characteri&s;tic of &s;edition lies in the
forwarding, preparing, and producing &s;uch a &s;tate of things,
as may naturally i&s;&s;ue in public trouble and commotion;
and it is oppo&s;ed to the guilt of tho&s;e who are actively en|gaged
in the tumult or ri&s;ing, if any en&s;ues. Farther, riot
and &s;edition differ in their &s;cope and object. The crime
of &s;edition is a State crime; which is levelled again&s;t the
Government, &s;tructure of laws, or political order of the land;
or at lea&s;t has relation to &s;ome object of public and general
concernment; in regard to which if any <HI>ho&s;tile</HI> ri&s;ing en&s;ue,
the offender &s;hall be guilty of no lower crime than trea&s;on.
Whereas the objects of riot or convocation of the lieges,
(as has already more fully been explained), are matters
<PB N="493" REF="494">
of local and private grievance; things in which a parti|cular
place or neighbourhood only is concerned, and &s;uch
as in nowi&s;e tend to impugn the authority, or un&s;ettle the
order or economy of the State. If, by handbill, or by
&s;peech and di&s;cour&s;e, any one excite the populace of &s;uch a
town, to re&s;cue &s;uch a pri&s;oner from gaol, or to plunder
&s;uch a ve&s;&s;el lying in the harbour with grain; and if a tu|mult
actually follow; this is a riot, of which he the in&s;ti|gator
is art and part: or if no riot follow, he is guilty of at|tempting
to excite one. But if a per&s;on print and publi&s;h a
di&s;cour&s;e, wherein he de&s;cribes the Legi&s;lature as corrupt
and incompetent to its functions; and advi&s;es to hold a
convention of the people, who &s;hall reform the Govern|ment
after their own fancy, or upon a new and more popu|lar
&s;y&s;tem, devi&s;ed and propo&s;ed in this di&s;cour&s;e; then is
the author guilty of <HI>real &s;edition:</HI> for he has taken a mo&s;t
material <HI>&s;tep</HI> or <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> towards di&s;turbing the tranquillity
of the State. The members of &s;uch convention too, if it
&s;hall a&s;&s;emble, are guilty of the &s;ame offence, though in
their meetings and proceedings they confine them&s;elves to
the traducing of the Legi&s;lature, and the uttering of di&s;|loyal
and inflammatory <HI>&s;peeches:</HI> for the holding of any a&s;&s;em|bly
for &s;uch purpo&s;es is a &s;ub&s;tantial <HI>act,</HI> which forwards
and facilitates, and in part executes the main project of de|bauching
the minds of the people, and altering the Govern|ment
of the land. But if, in farther pro&s;ecution of the &s;ame
plan, &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;editious mover of this mea&s;ure, and
having &s;ufficiently inflamed the people for their purpo&s;e, the
members of this convention, and their adherents, &s;hall pro|ceed
to ri&s;e in ho&s;tile manner, though it &s;hould not be
with full equipment of arms, nor in regular array of war;
then is this ri&s;ing no mob nor riot, but an act of war levied
<PB N="494" REF="495">
again&s;t the King; by rea&s;on of the high and public nature of
the enterpri&s;e. The crime of &s;edition, therefore, lies in the
&s;tirring of &s;uch humours, as naturally tend to change and
commotion in the State. So near, indeed, is the alliance be|tween
&s;edition and trea&s;on, that if, in&s;tead of &s;owing the
&s;eeds of a ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition to the Government, or preparing
&s;uch materials as in time may kindle into a flame, the of|fender
&s;hall &s;eck the &s;ame object more immediately, by a direct
and definite exhortation to the people to ri&s;e at that particular
&s;ea&s;on and conjuncture, as advantageous for gaining their
ends; this mea&s;ure, in like manner as a con&s;ultation to levy
war, &s;eems to be nothing le&s;s than an act of compa&s;&s;ing the
death of the King; being a decided and material &s;tep towards
the doing of that, which cannot be done without the plain
danger of the Sovereign's life<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">If the exhortation to ri&s;e in the ca&s;e of Fi&s;che Palmer, had been more &s;pe|cial, direct and appropriate, in&s;tead of vague and general declamation, it would have fallen under the ob&s;ervation here made.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AGAIN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verbal Sediton and Lea&s;ing|making di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.</NOTE> with re&s;pect to verbal &s;edition, Er&s;kine has &s;aid,
that it is the &s;ame offence as lea&s;ing-making. And this, as
mentioned formerly, under the head of Lea&s;ing-making, may
thus far be true, (in which the &s;ituation is not peculiar),
that the&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions may in &s;ome in&s;tances coincide, and
the &s;ame act be libelled with propriety, either as lea&s;ing|making
or &s;edition; &s;eeing they &s;o often agree in this circum|&s;tance,
of their tendency to le&s;&s;en the due reverence of the
Sovereign with his people. Yet &s;till, as ob&s;erved on the
&s;ame occa&s;ion, the two offences are materially di&s;tingui&s;hed;
both with re&s;pect to the means employed, which in the ca&s;e
of &s;edition, may be far more various and exten&s;ive than in
lea&s;ing-making, and in the nature al&s;o of the object at which
<PB N="495" REF="496">
they aim; the one being done upon a project of di&s;turbing
the State, the other out of &s;pecial di&s;like of the particular
Prince upon the throne as a per&s;on, and with the purpo&s;e of
injuring his fame or giving him di&s;tre&s;s. Thus lea&s;ing-ma|king
and &s;edition are not convertible terms. There is &s;edi|tion,
which is not lea&s;ing-making, and lea&s;ing-making which
is not &s;edition; and either may be committed in many in|&s;tances,
without at all approaching to the guilt of the other.</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature, accordingly, in framing the &s;tatute 1703,
c. 4. which aboli&s;hed lea&s;ing-making as a capital crime, had
well under&s;tood and paid &s;trict regard to this di&s;tinction.
For while they &s;pecified the act 1584, c. 134. &startq;<HI>anent &s;lan|derers
of the King, his progenitors, e&s;tate and realm,&endq;</HI> as one
of the proper &s;tatutes again&s;t lea&s;ing-making, which was to
be modified by the new law; they left untouched and en|tire
another act of the &s;ame Parliament, the act 1584, c. 130.
which has for title &startq;<HI>anent the authority of the Three E&s;tates of
Parliament;</HI>&endq; and which puni&s;hes as traitors, all per&s;ons who
&s;hall travail to impair the power, authority, or dignity of
them, or any of them.</P>
<P>IT may,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tinction of verbal and real Sedition.</NOTE> however, be true, that &s;edition may with propriety
be divided, as in Er&s;kine's work, into that which is verbal and
that which is real; though as to any u&s;e which this will &s;erve
in the practice, or even in the teaching of the law upon the
&s;ubject, it is not perhaps material nor worthy to be ob&s;erved.
But &s;erve what u&s;e it may, the di&s;tinction is not to be taken, as
in Er&s;kine, from the form wherein the mi&s;chief is conveyed,
as by words and &s;peeches, or by other proceedings; but
from the nature and &s;ub&s;tance of the thing it&s;elf that is
done. Under which rule, a pamphlet, a hand-bill, or even a
&s;peech, according to the matter thereof, or the occa&s;ion of
<PB N="496" REF="497">
uttering it, may properly be referred to the one or the
other &s;pecies of &s;edition. If all that can be &s;aid of the
compo&s;ition is, generally, that it is of an inflammatory
kind; &s;uch as by the principles it inculcates, and the
obloquy it throws out on the management of public af|fairs,
tends to the infu&s;ion of jealou&s;y and di&s;content among
the multitude; but without proceeding to any propo&s;al of a
plan, or &s;et of active operations, as grounded upon the&s;e prin|ciples,
and fit to be followed in the exi&s;ting &s;tate of things;
this may with propriety be referred to the head of verbal &s;e|dition.
It was for a compo&s;ition of this character, that Robert|&s;on
and Berry were convicted, as has been mentioned; and
William Stewart was outlawed upon a charge of the like
nature, on the 11th March 1793. But if, along with this
general expo&s;ition of fal&s;e doctrines, or this pa&s;&s;ionate &s;atyr
and reproach of the Government, the work &s;hall proceed
to make a practical application of its principles, and to di&s;|clo&s;e
and recommend a cour&s;e of mea&s;ures for accompli&s;h|ing
a change or reformation of the State; as was done in an
addre&s;s by Jo&s;eph Gerald to the people, which urged the
in&s;tituting of &s;ocieties all over the land, and the uniting
of them by a general convention of delegates, to be called
and holden after a certain fa&s;hion there de&s;cribed; then is
this publication no other than an act of real and &s;ub&s;tantial
&s;edition. It is not the pure divulging of words, which may
corrupt the temper of tho&s;e to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed:
The opening of &s;uch a coun&s;el, and the organi&s;ing of the
future a&s;&s;embly and political relation, is a <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> which pro|motes
the project of change, and may as materially &s;erve
the cau&s;e, as any thing that is done in pur&s;uance of the pro|po&s;al.
The &s;peeches, in like manner, which are made in the
regular meetings of the di&s;affected, as far as they contain
<PB N="497" REF="498">
any &s;ugge&s;tion of activity, or chalk out a line of conduct to
be followed for making pro&s;elytes to their opinions, or
otherwi&s;e &s;trengthening their intere&s;t, are to be viewed in
the very &s;ame light: They are not mere words; they are
the doing of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the con&s;olidating of the enter|pri&s;e
that is in hand. But after all, this di&s;tinction &s;eems
not to be of any moment or advantage in the law. For either
&s;pecies of the offence may be equally charged and tried un|der
the general name of &s;edition; and there is no ab&s;olute
rule for di&s;tingui&s;hing the degree of puni&s;hment of the two
kinds.</P>
<P>II. THE crimes of trea&s;on and &s;edition are the mo&s;t inte|re&s;ting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Enli&s;ting Men to &s;erve a Foreign State.</NOTE>
as well as comprehen&s;ive of tho&s;e offences which
are committed again&s;t the King or State. It is, however,
proper to mention, that by &s;tatute 9th Geo. II. c. 30.
which proceeds upon the ju&s;t and &s;alutary principle of hin|dering
the &s;idelity of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects to be corrupted,
and the power of the kingdom to be weakened, by with|drawing
them from the realm, and attaching them to the mi|litary
&s;ervice of a foreign State; the following practices are de|clared
to be felony, without benefit of clergy, and puni&s;hable
with death, 1. If any &s;ubject of Great Britain &s;hall enli&s;t or
enter as a &s;oldier with any foreign Prince or State, without
his Maje&s;ty's leave. 2. If any per&s;on &s;hall procure a &s;ubject
of his Maje&s;ty's &s;o to enli&s;t and enter: Or, 3dly, &s;hall hire or
retain any &s;uch &s;ubject, with intent to cau&s;e him &s;o enli&s;t or
enter: Or, 4thly, &s;hall procure any &s;uch &s;ubject to embark
or go beyond &s;eas, with intent &s;o to enli&s;t. It appears that
doubts had been entertained how far the contracting, hiring,
retaining, or procuring with &s;uch intent, fell under the in|tendment
of the &s;tatute, unle&s;s the enli&s;ting-money were actu|ally
<PB N="498" REF="499">
paid within this realm. To obviate this difficulty, it
was declared by &s;tatute 29th Geo. II. c. 17. that the &s;everal
things above mentioned &s;hould be felony, and puni&s;hable
with death, though no enli&s;ting-money were paid or recei|ved
on account of the engagement. On the fir&s;t of the&s;e
&s;tatutes, libel was found relevant and &s;ent to an a&s;&s;ize, in the
ca&s;e of Robert Cameron, in the month of January 1743. But
this pannel had a verdict in his favour.</P>
<P>III. WITH re&s;pect to the offence of an enli&s;ted &s;oldier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crime of de&s;ert|ing from Bri|ti&s;h Army.</NOTE> in
de&s;erting his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Black&s;t. vol. iv. c. 7. No. 5.</NOTE> it does not appear that this,
by our practice, as by &s;pecial &s;tatutes in England, is a point
of dittay, or crime cogni&s;able by the ordinary courts of law.
In 1644, a Parliamentary commi&s;&s;ion was indeed given to
the Bailies of Edinburgh, to hold courts upon runaway &s;ol|diers;
and under this authority<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The record bears that they had authority &startq;<HI>per commi&s;&s;ionem Dominorum Parliamenti in Parliamento &s;eden. et Dominorum committium eorundem vertute eorum Litterae commi&s;&s;ionis.</HI>&endq;</NOTE> &s;entence of death was
pa&s;&s;ed upon James Frei&s;che, on the 13th of Augu&s;t 1644, for
leaving his company and colours in the cour&s;e of an expe|dition.
But this was a &s;pecial interpo&s;ition for that time,
and has not been followed by any general provi&s;ion to the &s;ame
effect: &s;o that the pro&s;ecution of this offence in Scotland
entirely re&s;ts upon the annual &s;tatute again&s;t mutiny and de|&s;ertion,
which puni&s;hes it with death, or &s;uch other puni&s;h|ment

<P>I AM to inquire in this chapter concerning tho&s;e offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COINING, &amp;c.</NOTE>
under the rank of trea&s;on or mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, which
are injurious to his Maje&s;ty's prerogative with re&s;pect to
the right of coinage for his dominions. And as an in|troduction
to the knowledge of the&s;e, which continue to be
governed by the proper Scotti&s;h practice, it will be worth
while briefly to take notice of our ancient ordinances, and
cour&s;e of practice with re&s;pect to this matter in general;
though now in part &s;uper&s;eded by the communication of the
Engli&s;h trea&s;on laws.</P>
<P>IN entering upon this inquiry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes relative to Coining.</NOTE> we have to remark nearly
the &s;ame &s;tate of things, as with re&s;pect to the forgery of
writings; namely, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vague and ill dige&s;ted &s;ta|tutes,
in which, taken by them&s;elves, it would be difficult to
find the preci&s;e rule of the &s;everal modes of offence; but
which were probably rather intended as monitors towards
execution of the law at particular times, when there was
need of &s;everity, than to introduce any thing new into it;
<PB N="500" REF="501">
and which are explained by a con&s;tant and invariable u&s;age
of inflicting the highe&s;t pains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CH XXVIII.</NOTE> with little di&s;tinction, on all
the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of this cla&s;s.</P>
<P>THE olde&s;t act on the &s;ubject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes relative to $word$.</NOTE> the act 1449, c. 29. is alto|gether
general; and only directs, &startq;that all fal&s;e &s;trikers of
gold, &s;ilver, or of fal&s;e groates and pennies, be &s;earched and
written for, and broucht to the King to be puni&s;hed as law|will.&endq;
Of the &s;ame character is the act 1540, c. 124. which
directs, that the offenders be &s;ent to the Ju&s;tice, &startq;to be
ju&s;tified for their demerites, after the form of the lawes of
the realme, made upon fal&s;e cuinzieours.&endq; As is al&s;o ano|ther
law of the &s;ame Parliament, c. 99. which enjoins,
&startq;That nae manner of man take upon hande for to wrong the
Crowne of weicht, or ony uther gold of weicht, throw
pretence of this act, under the paine to be accu&s;ed and
puni&s;hed as fal&s;ers of the King's graces money, conforme
to the commoun lawe and &s;tatutes of the realme.&endq; Be&s;ide
th$&s;e, which truly determine nothing, there are but two &s;ta|tutes
more; of which the la&s;t in date, the act 1563, c. 70.
would be entirely of the &s;ame vague de&s;cription, if it were not
for that clau&s;e which invites to inform of &s;uch offences, and
promi&s;es to the informers, that they &startq;fall have that ane
halfe of the e&s;cheit of all his lands and gudes, moveable and
unmoveable, of the &s;aid per&s;on or per&s;ones, offenders of
this pre&s;ent act and law.&endq; Now this, though it does not
enact, implies, that the pains are the pains of trea&s;on; &s;ince
to that crime alone our cu&s;tom has attached any forfeiture of
immoveable goods. The other and more ancient &s;tatute 1469,
c. 40. as printed in Skene's edition, and in Glendook's &s;mall
edition of the &s;tatutes, entirely relates to the uttering of
counterfeit black or copper money; which offence, however,
<PB N="501" REF="502">
it expre&s;sly puni&s;hes with death. As printed in the Black
Acts, and in Glendook's &s;olio edition, the &s;ame &s;tatute has
the&s;e farther words: &startq;that nae maner of per&s;on bring into
this realme ony &s;trange black money of uther realmes,
<HI>or counterfit the King's money,</HI> under pain of death, as
&s;aid is.&endq; Which la&s;t words apply the capital pain, alike
to the counterfeiting as to the home bringing and uttering.
But &s;till, as Mackenzie has ob&s;erved of this &s;tatute<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;. p. 74.</NOTE>, it in ei|ther
part only relates to black money; though it no doubt
affords a very probable argument, that the pains of law were
not inferior for counterfeiting the more precious coins.</P>
<P>THE truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offences again&s;t the Coin were by Cu&s;tom trea|&s;onable.</NOTE> however, as already hinted, is, that the cu&s;|tom
of Scotland, grounded in &s;ome mea&s;ure on the civil law<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Cod. lib. 9. tit. 24. Lex 1, 2.; Dieg. lib. 48. tit. 10. L. S.</NOTE>
and to which, in their general expre&s;&s;ions, the&s;e enactments
mu&s;t be held to have relation, was uniform and decided in
applying the puni&s;hment of death to all the offences of this

Thus, on the 24th of November 1599, Walter Murray,
William Symp&s;on, Walter Thom&s;on, and Thomas Fra&s;er, were
&s;everally convicted of venting, or as art and part of forging,
or of knowing and concealing the feigning of fal&s;e money;
&s;uch as ten &s;hilling, two merk, and five pound pieces, as al&s;o
crowns, hat-pieces, and bra&s;s-pi&s;toles gilt over. They had &s;en|tence
to be worried at a &s;take, their bodies to be burned to
a&s;hes, their lands, heritages, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to be forfeited, and
their moveables e&s;cheat. John Murray, convicted at the &s;ame
time, was bani&s;hed in virtue of a &s;pecial warrant from the King;
which proceeds upon the narrative of his confe&s;&s;ion, and in|formation
again&s;t the others. On the 6th June 1601, Thomas
Gla&s;s, convicted of venting twelve fal&s;e 50s. pieces of gold,
and 20 fal&s;e five pound pieces, received by him from George
Drummond and the &s;aid Murray, had the like &s;entence of
death, forfeiture; and e&s;cheat. On 27th November 1601,
George Drummond, for trea&s;onable <HI>outing</HI> of fal&s;e hat-pieces,
crowns, four pound pieces, and four merk pieces, by him
bought from Hans John&s;ton, a Fleming, and others, has judg|ment
in the &s;ame terms. As has Patrick Drummond, January
12. 1602; being convicted as art and part, redd, coun&s;el,
and concealing, of the forging of five pound and 50s. pieces,
<PB N="503" REF="504">

Borrow&s;tounne&s;s, convicted of bringing home from England,
and outputting here, four &s;core and &s;ix fal&s;e merk pieces;
with only this difference, that the mode of execution was
by hanging on a gibbet. This al&s;o was the doom pronoun|ced

&s;entence the crime is characteri&s;ed as trea&s;on, or of a trea&s;on|able
nature. The &s;ame de&s;cription is al&s;o given of it in the
following ca&s;es, where, however, no forfeiture of heritage is
decreed. On the 9th of February 1598, El&s;peth Skirling, Ma|rion
Hepburn, and Helen Bruce, &s;pou&s;e of Ralph Wallace, are
convicted of coining and uttering &startq;Scots te&s;tones with the
cro&s;s,&endq; (a trade which they are &s;tated to have learned
from Hew Brunton an Engli&s;hman); and are condemned to
be worried at a &s;take, their bodies to be burnt, and their
moveables to be e&s;cheat. On the 3d March 1598, Ralph
Wallace<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The record in this ca&s;e al&s;o mentions forfeiture of heritage, but the words are interlined in a blacker ink, and in a different hand.</NOTE>, hu&s;band of the &s;aid Helen Bruce, receives the
&s;ame doom on a letter from the King, &startq;as convict of the
trea&s;onable taking and apprehending of the &s;aid Hew
Brunton, Engli&s;hman, wha cunzied fal&s;e cunzie within
the &s;aid Ralph's dwellinghous, and not putting him to ju&s;|tice.&endq;
On the 13th and 20th July 1602, Alexander Reid,
<PB N="504" REF="505">
cuttler in Edinburgh, was &s;entenced to be hanged, and to
forfeit his moveables, for the &startq;trea&s;onable printing of
fal&s;e twa merk pieces on the King's irons.&endq; On 7th De|cember
1602, Allan Napier, cuttler in Gla&s;gow, for the
trea&s;onable gilding of 27 eight and four merk pieces, was
adjudged to be worried at a &s;take, his body to be burned,
and his moveables e&s;cheat. Add to the&s;e, very numerous
ca&s;es for &s;o &s;hort a period, that of Rennie and Reid, 15th
Augu&s;t 1637, who are hanged and <HI>for fault</HI> for coining half
dollars, gro&s;e-cus, and other foreign coins in Ireland, and
importing and vending them here.</P>
<P>THUS it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Later capital Convictions for Offences again&s;t the Coin.</NOTE> that at this ancient period our practice
capitally puni&s;hed every &s;ort of offence again&s;t the coin;
counterfeiting, vending, di&s;gui&s;ing, or importing; and equal|ly
whether the coin were gold, &s;ilver or bra&s;s, home or fo|reign

<P>IT appears from the proceedings in this ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act 1696, c. 42. aboli&s;hed the Forfeiture.</NOTE> that doubts
had now come to be entertained, how far the clipping of mo|ney,
at lea&s;t of foreign money, and vending it for good after
clipping, was to be held a crime of the &s;ame degree: for this
practice, which was a &s;eparate article of charge again&s;t Co|chons,
was found only relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment.
But within a few months, this doubt was put an end to by
the &s;tatute 1696, c. 42. (probably &s;ugge&s;ted by this very trial),
which made it a capital crime, by clipping, wa&s;hing, filing,
or in any other manner of way, to dimini&s;h the proper coin
of the kingdom, or any other coin allowed to be current here.
This &s;tatute, however, entirely took away the trea&s;onable part
of the doom; and ordered that the pains either of coining
<PB N="506" REF="507">
fal&s;e money, or le&s;&s;ening the genuine coin, &s;hould only be the
pains of death and confi&s;cation of moveables.</P>
<P>ON this footing matters &s;tood at the time of the Union;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coining again made Trea&s;on|able at the Union.</NOTE>
when by the communication of the Engli&s;h trea&s;on laws,
the&s;e and all other high offences again&s;t the coin, were
again rai&s;ed to the rank of trea&s;on, from which they had
been &s;o lately degraded. We have therefore only to in|quire
in this place, concerning tho&s;e few articles of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion
in this &s;ort, which not being trea&s;on by the law of
England, &s;till remain under the rules of our ancient and
municipal practice.</P>
<P>1. SUCH,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coining Copper Money; if Ca|pital.</NOTE> in the fir&s;t place, is the coining of bra&s;s or cop|per
money; which before the &s;tatute 15. Geo. II. c. 28.
was only accounted a mi&s;demeanour by the law of England,
and was not liable to any &s;evere correction. By that en|actment,
which in its whole &s;tyle, as well as in the narra|tive
on which this part of it proceeds, &s;eems to be purely
Engli&s;h, the penalty is two years impri&s;onment, and the
finding of &s;urety for good behaviour during two years more.
But this re&s;traint being al&s;o found in&s;ufficient, another &s;ta|tute
was pa&s;&s;ed, the act 11. Geo. III. c. 40. which proceeds
on the like narrative as the former, and rai&s;es the coining
of a halfpenny or a farthing to the rank of felony: which
is al&s;o enacted with re&s;pect to the taking, receiving, or put|ting
off any quantity of counterfeit copper, not melted nor
broken down, for or at a lower rate or value than its deno|mination
imports. No &s;pecific puni&s;hment is, however, men|tioned
for either ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to be very doubtful whether either of the&s;e &s;ta|tutes
can be con&s;trued to extend to Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coining Copper Money; if Ca|pital.</NOTE> where, &s;o far

may, by our old laws, be puni&s;hed with the highe&s;t arbi|trary
pains, or even with death. This la&s;t opinion may be
maintained on the&s;e grounds. 1. That by the expre&s;s words
of the act 1469, c. 40, as printed in the Black Acts, or ori|ginal
edition, the coining of fal&s;e black money is a capital
crime. 2. By the words of the &s;ame act, as in the other
editions, even the importing, uttering, or taking of fal&s;e
black money, is a capital crime; which affords a &s;trong in|ference
with re&s;pect to the coining. 3. The cour&s;e of an|cient
practice offers many in&s;tances of capital &s;entence for
the coining of bra&s;s money. 4. The act 1696, c. 42. &s;ays
generally, of the coining of fal&s;e money, that it &s;hall be pu|ni&s;hed

WHATSOEVER the pains of law be, they are incurred in

and in nowi&s;e liable to pro&s;ecution, if the piece is not
formed after the &s;imilitude of &s;ome known national coin; &s;o
as it may circulate for &s;uch, and thus be forced upon tho&s;e

however be in favour of &s;uch pieces only, which are plainly

which differ from it in &s;ome of the more minute parts only of

the&s;e, as the other clau&s;es of this &s;tatute, whether they extend
to Scotland. We have &s;een, that according to the cour&s;e of

coiner. By one judgment, however, of a later date, that in
the ca&s;e of Weir, Hallywell, and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. and July 5, 6. 1699.</NOTE> the venting of the
fal&s;e coin, even when joined to the procuring of materials &s;ub|&s;ervient
to the coining, was found relevant only to infer an
<PB N="510" REF="511">
arbitrary puni&s;hment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Finds the indictment in &s;ua far as relates to David Weir and James Ren|wick, their buying the materials libelled, and venting fal&s;e coin, relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment.&endq; The&s;e per&s;ons were not convicted; but <HI>John</HI> Weir and Hallywell were convicted of the actual coining, and had &s;entence of death.</NOTE> Yet in the &s;till later ca&s;e of Gabriel
Clarke;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11, 26. and July 2. 1706.</NOTE> where the libel charged both coining and venting, and
in particular &s;et forth as to the la&s;t, that it is &startq;puni&s;hable by
the &s;ame pains, and as art and part of the fore&s;aid crime,&endq;
and &s;o concluded for capital puni&s;hment, the Court found
the indictment, as libelled, relevant to infer the pains libel|led.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">A verdict was returned again&s;t this man, finding only certain pre&s;umptions proved; on which he was tran&s;ported, July 2. 1705.</NOTE>
But whether in this they meant to &s;u&s;tain either
branch of it, or only the actual coining, as capital, cannot
from the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions with certainty be &s;aid; nor have I
found any later precedent upon the matter. If in truth, a mi|tigation
of the ancient practice on this head has taken place,
it may perhaps be attributed to the act 1696, c. 42. which
appears to have been intended as a general &s;ettlement of the
law relative to the coin; and does not, as naturally it might
have done, take any notice of the vending, as puni&s;hable in
the &s;ame manner with the counterfeiting. One thing is,
however, clear,&mdash;that to have the benefit of this mitigation,
the vender mu&s;t be purely &s;uch, and without any concern
in the fabrication; for if the vending take place upon any
&s;ort of &s;ociety or combination with the coiner, by which the
profit of the whole adventure is to be &s;hared between them,
this certainly makes the vender art and part of the capital
offence.</P>

3. A THIRD offence, which is not trea&s;on by the law
of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uttering of fal&s;e Briti&s;h coin brought from abroad.</NOTE> is the <HI>uttering</HI> of fal&s;e Briti&s;h coin, which
has been counterfeited in, and imported from a foreign

<HI>imports</HI> &s;uch money, in order to utter it<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Black&s;t. vol. iv. p. 8$&mdash;Hawkins, b. I. c. 17. No. 68&mdash;Hale, b. 1. c. 20. p. 225.</NOTE>. I need hardly
ob&s;erve, that this offence cannot be &s;ubject to a higher pu|ni&s;hment
than the uttering of fal&s;e coin which has been
fabricated within the realm.</P>
<P>4. IN regard al&s;o to fal&s;e <HI>foreign</HI> coin, &s;uch as is current
here by proclamation; it is to be ob&s;erved, that according
to &s;tatute 1. and 2. Philip and Mary, c. 11. it is only the
importing it from abroad, with intent to utter, that is made
trea&s;on<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 1. c. 17. No. 65, 68&mdash;Black&s;t. vol. iv. p. 89.</NOTE>. To utter only, though knowingly, &s;uch fal&s;e fo|reign
coin, imported by another, is not trea&s;on, but a lower
offence. According to the cour&s;e of our practice, it would be
&s;everely puni&s;hable, but not with death; at lea&s;t, if it be
true, as already hinted, that even the uttering of the proper
coin of the realm cannot any longer be puni&s;hed in that
way.</P>
<P>5. A FIFTH offence of this cla&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coining or light|ening foreign Money.</NOTE> is that of coining within
Britain, or lightening there, &s;uch foreign monies as are
not current here by act of Parliament, nor by royal procla|mation<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Black&s;t. vol. iv. p. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN former times, and e&s;pecially in the 15th century, ma|ny
&s;tatutes were pa&s;&s;ed upon this matter of the currency of
<PB N="512" REF="513">
foreign coin; &s;ettling from time to time the &s;everal &s;pecies
which &s;hould be allowed to pa&s;s, and often altering their
proportions to each other, and to our own coins, in the
hope probably by that means of gaining &s;ome advantage.
Once, indeed, it was attempted, (by &s;tatute 1597, c. 253.)
to call in all foreign money into the mint, and hin|der
its having cour&s;e among the lieges for the future.
But this, if intended as a perpetual law, was in a great
mea&s;ure incapable of execution, and accordingly failed
to be ob&s;erved; as appears from the capital convictions
which have been mentioned, for the fabricating or pa&s;&s;ing
of foreign coins. But in con&s;equence of the Union, which
reduced the two kingdoms into one realm as to the matter of
coin, we are now &s;ubject to the &s;ame rule in that re&s;pect as
in England; &s;o that nothing but &s;tatute or royal proclama|tion
can rai&s;e any foreign money to the denomination of a
lawful coin, &s;uch as it is <HI>trea&s;on,</HI> by 1. Mary, &s;t. 2. c. 6.
or 1. and 2. Philip and Mary, c. 11. to import for the pur|po&s;e
of uttering.</P>
<P>Now with re&s;pect to tho&s;e foreign coins which are only
current by con&s;ent of parties, and are taken at a rate and va|lue
as fixed by their agreement; it appears that to counter|feit
them is mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, by &s;tatute 14. Elizabeth,
c. 3. But the vending of &s;uch fal&s;e coin, or the lightening
and impairing of it, &s;eems to be only a mi&s;demeanour, to

<P>I. I SHALL begin with a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the latter cla&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cription of Bla&s;phemy.</NOTE>&mdash;
the crime of Bla&s;phemy,&mdash;or as &s;ome of the foreign doctors,
<PB N="514" REF="515">
with more fancy than propriety,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP XXIX.</NOTE> have termed it, the crime
of trea&s;on or lae&s;e maje&s;ty again&s;t God; which con&s;i&s;ts in
the denial of his being, attributes, or nature, or in the ut|tering
of impious and prophane things again&s;t God, or the
authority of the Holy Scriptures. According to the &s;ame
lawyers, who in this are &s;upported by the acceptation of
the term in common language, bla&s;phemy is only com|mitted
by the uttering of &s;uch things, when it is done in
a &s;coffing and railing manner; out of a reproachful di&s;|po&s;ition
in the &s;peaker, and, as it were, with pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t
the Almighty, rather than with any purpo&s;e of propagating
the irreverent opinion. The like &s;entiments, uttered di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionately,
or conveyed in any calm and advi&s;ed form,
though they are &s;till criminal, are, however, according
to this opinion, a crime of a different &s;ort; and rather a
here&s;y, or an apo&s;tacy, according to the degree of what is
&s;aid, than a proper bla&s;phemy. Voet has de&s;cribed it thus:
&startq;<HI>In Deum bla&s;phemia, qua de Deo pugnantia cum ejus natura et

The crime, with us, does not re&s;t upon the foot of

under the regulation of po&s;itive &s;tatutes, which, both in the
rubric and enactment, apply the name of Bla&s;phemy to ei|ther

di|&s;tingui&s;h
between the reproachful abu&s;e, or malicious &s;cof|fing,
and the erroneous or heretical teaching. The act 1661,
c. 21. which is our earlie&s;t ordinance upon this &s;ubject, de|clares,
in the fir&s;t place, thus, &startq;That who&s;oever, hereafter,
not being di&s;tracted in his wits, &s;hall <HI>rail upon, or cur&s;e</HI> God,
or any of the per&s;ons of the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, &s;hall be pro|ce&s;&s;ed
before the Chief Ju&s;tice, and being found guilty, &s;hall
be puni&s;hed with death.&endq; Under which words, it is cer|tain
that the offender incurs the pain of death for one tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion;
the thing being done in that &s;piteful and contumeli|ous
manner, which is &s;hocking to all who hear it, and is held
to indicate the wilful, depraved, and licentious di&s;po&s;ition of
the &s;peaker. The &s;equel of the &s;tatute is di&s;tinct from the
clau&s;e above recited, and materially different. &startq;<HI>Likeas,</HI> his
Maje&s;ty, with advice fore&s;aid, finds, &s;tatutes, and ordains,

and being found guilty, that they be puni&s;hed with
death.&endq; Now here, to the denying of any of the per|&s;ons
of the Godhead, but without cur&s;ing or railing at them,
the pain of death is only affixed in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinate conti|nuance
in the fault: wherein the Legi&s;lature have probably
proceeded on the opinion, that &s;uch errors may ari&s;e from
weakne&s;s only, or ignorance, or ha&s;ty deci&s;ion, without ma|lice

<P>OUR only other &s;tatute concerning bla&s;phemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes again&s;t Bla&s;phemy. 1695, c. 11.</NOTE> is that of
William and Mary, which pa&s;&s;ed a &s;hort time before one that
was made towards the &s;ame end, but on a le&s;s rigorous plan, in
England. It relates to the &s;ame &s;ort of bla&s;phemy as the latter
<PB N="516" REF="517">
part of the act 1661; and is to be con&s;idered as in explana|tion
and &s;upplement of that law, which is &s;aid to have been
found too narrow for the licentious opinions of tho&s;e times.
It therefore extends the de&s;cription of bla&s;phemy to any
denial or challenge, whether in di&s;cour&s;e or writing, &startq;of
the authority of the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New
Te&s;taments, or the Providence of God in the govern|ment
of the world,&endq; equally as to the denial of any of
the per&s;ons of the Godhead. And it proceeds to &s;ettle,
(which the former act, very improperly, had left indefinite),
who &s;hall be accounted an <HI>ob&s;tinate</HI> offender, upon whom,
as irreclaimable, the pain of death &s;hall be inflicted; name|ly,
he who &s;hall for the third time be convicted in this &s;ort.
For the fir&s;t fault, he is to make public atonement in &s;ack|cloth,
to the pari&s;h where the &s;candal was committed. For
the &s;econd fault, he is to pay a fine of a year's rent of his
real e&s;tate, and a twentieth part of his per&s;onal effects;
and he is al&s;o to be impri&s;oned till he again make &s;atisfac|tion
to the pari&s;h. &startq;And for the third fault he &s;hall be pu|ni&s;hed
by death as an ob&s;tinate bla&s;phemer;&endq; &s;o that with|out
a relap&s;e after &s;uffering the penalties of his fir&s;t and &s;e|cond
fault, his life is not a forfeit to the law.</P>
<P>THE other mode of bla&s;phemy, by railing at or cur&s;i$g
any of the per&s;ons of the Godhead, this &s;tatute has no re|lation
to, and has left under the provi&s;ions of the former
act; whereby, in the &s;ingle in&s;tance, and though not attend|ed
with any aggravation of ob&s;tinacy, &s;uch irreverent and
contumelious words are &s;till a capital crime. As this is
plain upon the &s;tatutes them&s;elves; &s;o it is confirmed by the
proceedings in the ca&s;e of Aikenhead, in December 1696,
and that of Kinninmount, in November 1697; in which
la&s;t a plea to the contrary was overruled.</P>

contrition in &s;uch ca&s;es; whether it does away, or at

that act, the cen&s;ure of the fir&s;t offence is nothing
more than a public humiliation, and confe&s;&s;ion of &s;orrow for

again&s;t this high charge was that of intoxication at the time,
or rather of fury and di&s;traction ari&s;ing from exce&s;s in liquor.

railing at and cur&s;ing our Saviour, without any proof of his
having directly done &s;o, and upon inference only from opi|nions
which he had occa&s;ionally vented. Now, in the trial of
tho&s;e crimes which con&s;i&s;t in the uttering of words, and are
only made capital by &s;tatute, it &s;eems to be the &s;ounder, and
certainly is the more humane con&s;truction, that the pan|nel
is not to be condemned upon arguments and con&s;equences
deduced from his di&s;cour&s;e. The thing it&s;elf which the &s;ta|tute
has forbidden to be uttered, mu&s;t be &s;aid explicitly and
directly; in &s;uch a palpable and open form, that every one
who hears the words &s;hall know the law to be infringed. That
what he has &s;aid is an offence of the &s;ame cla&s;s, or tends to
the thing which is prohibited, or even that in the general
opinion it is equally or more criminal, will not ju&s;tify the
applying of this rigorous law to any thing which its expre&s;|&s;ions,
general as they are, do not comprehend. And as far
as the capital puni&s;hment is more &s;evere than any other; &s;o

<HEAD>II. PROPHANITY.</HEAD>
<P>AKIN to this, though lower in degree, is the offence of
Prophanity. Under which general appellation is included
the practice of prophane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing; all indecent
&s;coffing at religion; the di&s;turbance of divine wor&s;hip; and
al&s;o the open prophanation of the Lord's day, by the doing

<P>I. THE chief &s;tatutes with re&s;pect to cur&s;ing and &s;wearing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes again&s;t prophane Swear|ing.</NOTE>
are tho&s;e of Charles II. 1601, c. 19. and 1661, c. 38. No. 25.;
<PB N="520" REF="521">
which annex pecuniary pains to it, in proportion to the rank
of the offender, (whereof one half to go to pious u&s;es within
the pari&s;h, and the other to the informer, and to defray the
expence of proce&s;s); and which in ca&s;e of inability to pay,
allow corporal puni&s;hment to be inflicted according to the
degree and repetition of the fault, and the direction of for|mer
laws. The corporal pains pointed out for that ca&s;e by
the older &s;tatutes, 1551, c. 16. and 1581, c. 103. are chiefly
tho&s;e of impri&s;onment, and &s;etting in the jugs or &s;tocks, or

<P>2. THE act 1661, c. 38.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scoffing at Re|ligion.</NOTE> applies the &s;ame penalties, as in

The &s;ame thing is mentioned as a known offence in the&s;e
&s;tatutes, 1690, c. 25.; 1696, c. 13.; 1701, c. 11. Indeed it
is not to be doubted, that even at common law, all &s;peeches
or practices which favour of bla&s;phemy, or are to the plain
contempt and mockery of religion, fall under the cogni|&s;ance
of the Magi&s;trate as &s;candalous indecencies; and are

by 1661, c. 18. which is one of the late&s;t of them, are chiefly
pecuniary fines, with a power of ordering corporal puni&s;hment
in ca&s;e of inability to pay; but which the Judge could not
probably, for a fir&s;t offence, make u&s;e of to any greater extent
than that of inflicting a &s;hort impri&s;onment, or &s;etting the
offender in the &s;tocks or jugs. For a third offence, however,
by 1594, c. 201. the offender forfeits his moveables, and
brings his per&s;on in the King's will. Al&s;o, by 1579, c. 70. the
goods expo&s;ed to &s;ale in a fair or market upon Sunday, or in
a kirk or kirk-yard upon any day, are e&s;cheated to the u&s;e

to the twenty-four hours between Saturday and Mon|day;
but, by the act 1663, c. 19. reaches both the&s;e days
them&s;elves. The rea&s;on is, that through the preparation

prolonging of the market in drinking and revelling on Sa|turday
evening, there is ri&s;k that the holine&s;s of the Lord's

<HEAD>III. HERESY.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER offence of the &s;ame cla&s;s with the above,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Was at fir&s;t pu|ni&s;hed in the Clerical Courts.</NOTE> but
of which, happily, there is now no occa&s;ion to treat any
otherwi&s;e than as an article of hi&s;tory, is that of here&s;y;
which con&s;i&s;ts in the profe&s;&s;ion of &s;uch opinions as do not
go to the entire &s;ubver&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, but only to the
denial of &s;ome of its material articles or points of faith.
How my&s;terious and &s;ubtile &s;oever any of the&s;e might be,
no one but knows the extreme danger which once attended
the mi&s;under&s;tanding of them; and how deep the guilt was
held of any the &s;lighte&s;t deviation, whether out of wilful|ne&s;s
or ignorance, from the ab&s;olute &s;tandard of the pure
and orthodox faith. To determine what this was, and to
detect and puni&s;h the error, was a department of bu&s;ine&s;s,
which, according to the notions of former times, was above
the cogni&s;ance of any &s;ecular court, and even beyond the
power of the Legi&s;lature, in any manner of way to regulate
or interfere with. But, (which rendered the&s;e preten&s;ions
&s;o much the more grievous), from this of attributing the
&s;ole juri&s;diction in &s;uch matters to the Spiritual Courts, the
ju&s;t con&s;equence did not en&s;ue, of limiting the cen&s;ures to
be inflicted for tho&s;e errors of opinion, to &s;uch as were <HI>pro
&s;alute animoe,</HI> and of a proper &s;piritual nature; as by the en|joining
of alms or penance, the refu&s;al of admi&s;&s;ion to the
privileges of the Church, or throwing out the heretic from
the &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aid of &s;ecular Arm afterwards lent them.</NOTE> It is true, this was the cour&s;e
of di&s;cipline in the beginning; but from which, at an early
period, the clergy were every where tempted to depart, and,
<PB N="525" REF="526">
in aid of their cen&s;ures, to call in the temporal expedient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HERESY.</NOTE>
of immediate puni&s;hment in the offender's goods and per&s;on.
Nor did they long confine them&s;elves to tho&s;e inferior penal|ties
of this &s;ort, which their own courts were in &s;ome countries
&s;uffered to inflict, &s;uch as impri&s;onment, fine or confi&s;cation;
but extended their preten&s;ions, and were not content till they
engaged the civil power to interpo&s;e for them with its coercive
authority, and undertake the odious office of executing the
highe&s;t vengeance of the Church, upon what&s;oever per&s;on
it delivered over as a heretic convicted to the &s;ecular arm.</P>
<P>THIS is the general outline of the hi&s;tory of the thing all
over Europe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute on this Head.</NOTE> and with us of Scotland, as el&s;ewhere, laws
were enacted, which appointed the Church this &s;ervice and
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when need &s;hould be, for containing her chil|dren
in their duty. E&s;pecially, the act 1424, c. 28. ordains,
&startq;That ilk bi&s;hop &s;hall garre inquire to the inqui&s;ition of he|re&s;ie,
quhair onie &s;ik beis founden, and that they be pu|ni&s;hed
as law of halie kirk requires. And gif it mi&s;teris,
that &s;ecular power be called in &s;upport and helping of ha|lie
kirk.&endq; How far the &s;ecular arm was to interpo&s;e, in
aid of the &s;piritual cen&s;ures, the &s;tatute does not &s;ay; nei|ther
does it pretend to de&s;cribe or limit the offence it&s;elf.
But we know that even before this time, and while there was
no &s;tatute for it, the general example of Europe had come to
be followed here, in carrying the interpo&s;ition to the utmo&s;t
length<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In 1408, John Re&s;by, one of the followers of Wickliffe, was delivered over&punc; to the &s;ecular arm; and was burned at Perth. Bower, 441&ndash;443.</NOTE>; and that as the &s;entence of the Church con&s;igned

took place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Change of Prac|tice on the Re|formation.</NOTE> In&s;tead of being left to the variable and uncer|tain
con&s;truction of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, the &s;tandard of

in a &s;tatute which engro&s;&s;es the full confe&s;&s;ion of
the Prote&s;tant doctrine of faith.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1567, c. 3.</NOTE> And at the &s;ame time,
though without the aid of any expre&s;s law, and owing to the

again&s;t all &s;evere puni&s;hment in their per&s;ons, upon
any &s;entence of the Church for heretical opinions. I &s;ay
again&s;t all &s;evere puni&s;hment <HI>in their per&s;ons:</HI> For &s;o far
was this from being true with re&s;pect to their e&s;tate, that by
two &s;tatutes of the year 1609, (c. 3. and c. 4.) the rents and
revenues of all per&s;ons excommunicated for religious cau&s;es,
were declared to be e&s;cheated to the King; and an injunc|tion
was given not to <HI>expede</HI> any heritable title in their fa|vour,
either in the King's Chancery, or in that of any &s;ub|ject
&s;uperior. Nay more; even as to their per&s;ons, it &s;till
continued to be law, and was provided for by expre&s;s &s;ta|tutes,
fir&s;t in the Pre&s;byterian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1572, c. 53. 1661, c. 25. 1663, c. 23.</NOTE> and afterwards in the Epi&s;co|pal
times, that letters of horning and caption &s;hould i&s;&s;ue
upon &s;entence of excommunication; and &s;hould be followed
with the ordinary con&s;equences of that &s;ort of civil rebel|lion,
for compelling them to obey the &s;entence, and be re|conciled
to the Church.</P>
<P>AT the Revolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil pains of Excommunica|tion aboli&s;hed.</NOTE> however, by which time long expe|rience
had taught men &s;ome of the inconveniences of this
alliance of the Church and the temporal e&s;tate; all acts en|joining
civil pains upon &s;entence of excommunication were
re&s;cinded, by the &s;tatute 1690, c. 28. The &s;ame thing was
<PB N="527" REF="528">
again declared by the &s;tatute 10. Anne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NON-CONFOR|MITY.</NOTE> c. 7. which even
takes the farther &s;tep of prohibiting any Judge to lend
his aid for obliging any one to appear before a church court,
when &s;ummoned in a proce&s;s for excommunication, or to
obey &s;uch &s;entence when given. In this manner, at length
was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the complete, and, (as I mu&s;t certainly
e&s;teem it), &s;alutary &s;eparation and independence of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
and civil powers. The conviction, therefore, of
here&s;y, in the &s;piritual court, is not, at this day, the ground

<HEAD>IV. NON-CONFORMITY.</HEAD>
<P>BUT although,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of the Laws again&s;t Non-conform|i&s;ts.</NOTE> at the Reformation, the adherents of the
new e&s;tabli&s;hment, thus vindicated them&s;elves from that
&s;tate of bondage in which their ance&s;tors had lain under the
clergy; this was not done, in the main, out of any di&s;like
of per&s;ecution for religious opinions, nor with any purpo&s;e
of introducing a comprehen&s;ive &s;cheme of toleration; a
thing, how ju&s;t and rea&s;onable &s;oever in it&s;elf, of which there
was not an example any where, till a much later period in
the hi&s;tory of Europe. On the contrary, with almo&s;t equal
zeal as the votaries of that religion under which they had
endured &s;o much oppre&s;&s;ion, they laboured after the like ob|ject,
of &s;uffering none but <HI>the religion</HI> (as their term for it
was) within the realm; and reducing all their fellow &s;ub|jects
to a &s;trict conformity to the national wor&s;hip. I pa&s;s
over the &s;tatutes 1567, c. 9. and 1609, c. 5. which di&s;abled
all but the members of the Pre&s;byterian Church to hold any
what&s;oever public office or employment. For whether it be
<PB N="528" REF="529">
true or not, according to the opinion of an enlightened nation
at this day, that &s;uch a preference is at all times a proper and
nece&s;&s;ary barrier to a national e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion; this
will not decide the policy of &s;uch a mea&s;ure, applied to the
recent e&s;tabli&s;hment of Pre&s;bytery, which had &s;uch a ho&s;t of
powerful and implacable enemies to contend with. But not
content with this &s;ecurity, and with pa&s;&s;ing a long train of
rigorous &s;tatutes, (of which more particularly afterwards),
again&s;t the teachers and adherents of the ancient faith;
the Legi&s;lature proceeded to puni&s;h for bare non-conformity,
con&s;i&s;ting only in the failure to hear the word, or receive the
&s;acrament, in the reformed kirks of the realm. To that pur|po&s;e
is the enactment of the &s;tatute 1600, c. 17. (in &s;ome
mea&s;ure copied from the temporary act 1572, c. 45.) which
impo&s;es a fine upon every &s;uch non-communicant, according
to his degree.</P>
<P>IT is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of the Laws again&s;t Non-conform|i&s;ts.</NOTE> that, though expre&s;&s;ed in general terms, this
&s;tatute, as &s;ome of its expre&s;&s;ions indicate, was in the main
levelled again&s;t Papi&s;ts; the grand enemy, of whom the
dread did for a while, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, withdraw attention
from the le&s;&s;er differences of opinion with re&s;pect to church-government
and form of wor&s;hip, among the Prote&s;tants them|&s;elves.
But, as in the warfare with this adver&s;ary, the people
of Scotland had imbibed a great jealou&s;y and bitterne&s;s of
di&s;po&s;ition in all matters of religion; &s;o it was not long be|fore
an almo&s;t equal rancor and animo&s;ity broke out be|tween
the two communions of Prote&s;tants, the Epi&s;copals
and Pre&s;byterians: and this was heightened to the utmo&s;t
by the long train of mutual injuries and per&s;ecutions, which
they underwent from each other in the cour&s;e of the civil
war. On the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, therefore, of Epi&s;copacy, at
<PB N="529" REF="530">
the Re&s;toration, not only were &s;uch of the Pre&s;byterian teach|ers
ejected from their livings, who would not &s;ubmit to a new
in&s;titution by the Bi&s;hops, (by which means nearly a third of
the whole pari&s;hes in the kingdom were deprived of their pa&s;|tors);
but mea&s;ures were taken to &s;ilence and extirpate them,
by in&s;i&s;ting for the &s;ame &s;trict conformity of every man to the
national di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip, which the Pre&s;byterians
them&s;elves had &s;o lately exacted; and by proceeding again&s;t
all &s;chi&s;matical withdrawers from the Church, though not
guilty of any offen&s;ive act, or public exerci&s;e of another form
of wor&s;hip, as per&s;ons di&s;affected to Government, and movers
of &s;edition.</P>
<P>THE act 1663,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of the Laws again&s;t Non-confor|mi&s;ts.</NOTE> c. 2. contains an open declaration to that
purpo&s;e; and inflicts &s;undry penalties and confi&s;cations, ac|cording
to the rank of the offenders, upon all &startq;who &s;hall
hereafter <HI>ordinarily</HI> and <HI>wilfully</HI> withdraw and ab&s;ent them|&s;elves
from the ordinary meetings of divine wor&s;hip in
their own pari&s;h-church on the Lord's day, whether on
account of Popery or other di&s;affection to the pre&s;ent go|vernment
of the Church.&endq; The &s;ame injunction is re|newed
in the act 1670, c. 7. which bears the &s;ame rea&s;ons,
and heightens the pecuniary penalties, as well as applies
them to every ca&s;e of ab&s;ence from the pari&s;h-church for
three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Sundays, without a rea&s;onable excu&s;e, to be
judged of by the Magi&s;trate; whom to encourage in his
inquiries concerning tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, the act rewards him with
a certain &s;hare of the fines. Farther, in regard to any he|ritor
who &s;hould withdraw for the &s;pace of a year; it autho|ri&s;ed
the Privy Council to call him before them, and tender
him a bond for his &s;ub&s;cription, obliging him not to ri&s;e in
arms again&s;t the King's authority, nor to countenance any
<PB N="530" REF="531">
who &s;hould do &s;o; which bond if he refu&s;ed, he was then to
be bani&s;hed, or to be &s;ecured at plea&s;ure of the Council, be&s;ide
forfeiting his moveables and the profits of his real e&s;tate for
his lifetime. This was a law for a limited time; but was
continued during the King's plea&s;ure by &s;tatute 1672, c. 17.
There were, be&s;ides, a great number of &s;upplementary acts,
relative to di&s;orderly bapti&s;ms and marriages; the taking up
of li&s;ts of &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons; rendering account of the con|victions;
and other the like matters, calculated to &s;ecure an
effectual compliance with the will of the Legi&s;lature on this
intere&s;ting &s;ubject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1681, c. 6.</NOTE> At length, in 1681, the noted Te&s;t-Act was
pa&s;&s;ed, which impo&s;ed an oath upon all per&s;ons in &s;tations of
public tru&s;t, civil, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or military, binding them to
the &s;tatutory confe&s;&s;ion of faith in every article; acknowledg|ing
the King's &s;upremacy over all per&s;ons, and in all cau&s;es,
as well eccle&s;ia&s;tical as civil; and di&s;owning any power to
meet in a&s;&s;emblies without leave of his Maje&s;ty, to treat
of any public matter relative either to the State or the
Church.</P>
<P>WHILE &s;uch was the temper of the times with re&s;pect to
the negative offence of withdrawing from the national
Church;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws again&s;t Conventicles.</NOTE> it is ea&s;y to imagine, how little chance there was
of any indulgence being &s;hown to acts of po&s;itive non-conformity,
by the public u&s;e of other forms of wor&s;hip.
Under the management of Lauderdale, who in the end be|came
the &s;ole mini&s;ter for Scotland, and who, though at
bottom a zealous Pre&s;byterian, &s;crupled not to promote the
flronge&s;t mea&s;ures again&s;t his brethren of that communion,
a violent law was enacted again&s;t <HI>conventicles:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1670, c. 5.</NOTE> for &s;o the
meetings were called in which tho&s;e deluded people, either
<PB N="531" REF="532">
privately and under cover, or in the fields, a&s;&s;embled to hear
their favourite preachers, and make wor&s;hip after their own
fa&s;hion. By this &s;tatute, heavy fines, to be made effectual
by &s;ummary impri&s;onment, were impo&s;ed upon all per&s;ons
not authori&s;ed by a Bi&s;hop, who &s;hould preach, pray, or ex|pound
the Scriptures in any meeting for wor&s;hip, except in
their own hou&s;es and with tho&s;e of their own family; or who
&s;hould even be pre&s;ent at any &s;uch meeting. And as to
preaching, praying, expounding the Scriptures, or convening
per&s;ons in a field conventicle, (or one held in a hou&s;e, but &s;o
numerous that part of the audience &s;tood without doors,
which was to be accounted a field conventicle); this tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion
it puni&s;hed with death and confi&s;cation of moveables,
even for the fir&s;t offence. By &s;tatute 1681, c. 4. very erroneou&s;|ly
entitled &startq;<HI>for &s;ecuring the peace of the country,</HI>&endq; the pecuni|ary
penalties were doubled; and additional penalties were
appointed for certain ca&s;es. At length, the evil being
daily more and more exa&s;perated by this irritating cour&s;e
of treatment; it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to apply the pain of
death to all preaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1685, c. 8.</NOTE> or even pre&s;ence, in tho&s;e meetings for
wor&s;hip, which it terms &startq;Nur&s;eries and Seminaries of rebel|lion,&endq;
whether held in hou&s;e or field. And to enforce the
execution of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive edicts, they were followed with
a long train of jealous and arbitrary provi&s;ions, exciting in|formers,
compelling evidence, making one per&s;on an&s;werable
for another, indemnifying for the &s;laughter of offenders, and
&s;o forth; which, to be &s;ure, the iniquity of the main law,
and the aver&s;ion, generally &s;peaking, of the lower orders of
the people to the Epi&s;copal communion, rendered nece&s;&s;ary,
if &s;o faulty a &s;y&s;tem of management were to be per&s;i&s;ted
in.</P>
<P><PB N="532" REF="533">
OPPRESSIVE as the&s;e edicts were in them&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rigorous Exe|cution of the&s;e Laws.</NOTE> they were
rendered &s;till more &s;o by the rigorous proceedings in execu|tion
of them, on the part of the King's &s;ervants for Scot|land,
our countrymen, Middleton and Sharp; who not only
&s;trained the law and their own authority to the utmo&s;t, but
even ventured to elude the expre&s;s in&s;tructions of their
ma&s;ter on the &s;ide of mercy. A &s;ort of high commi&s;&s;ion
court was appointed by the Privy Council, to execute the
ordinances again&s;t non-con|formi&s;ts. And in aid of this tri|bunal,
if in any part of the country the people had general|ly
de&s;erted the pari&s;h churches; there, as if in a &s;tate of re|bellion,
a military force was &s;ent among them, to be quar|tered
on the &s;uppo&s;ed delinquents, whom the commanders,
of their own authority, and without pretence of trial, obli|ged
to ran&s;om them&s;elves by the payment of fines and com|po&s;itions,
according to their plea&s;ure. At a later period, and
under the fal&s;e pretence of a rebellion in the we&s;tern coun|ties,
which only con&s;i&s;ted in the refu&s;al of the landlords to
&s;ign an illegal bond, by which they were to an&s;wer for their
tenants; an army of undi&s;ciplined Highlanders were let loo&s;e
to live at free quarters on the lands of the&s;e recu&s;ants, where
they committed at will every manner of &s;poil and violence.
No wonder, that under &s;uch u&s;age, men who were natural|ly
&s;ullen and bigoted, and who thus found them&s;elves hunt|ed
as it were like wild bea&s;ts, in return for the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive be|haviour
with which they had &s;een their cho&s;en e&s;tabli&s;hment
overthrown, contracted a fierce and &s;avage nature; which at
length broke out in an in&s;urrection, and required the u&s;e of
that military force, which had at fir&s;t been &s;o wantonly employ|ed
again&s;t them. But this re&s;i&s;tance, had, for the time, only
the effect of bringing down upon them the &s;till more &s;evere
vengeance of the authors of this blind and cruel policy; a
<PB N="533" REF="534">
vengeance which the &s;ufferers might indeed have avoided,
but only by renouncing the Covenant; which apo&s;tacy the&s;e
deluded enthu&s;ia&s;ts, (&s;urely &s;carce de&s;erving of hatred for
&s;uch an opinion, even if they had not been fixed in it by per|&s;ecution),
believed to be at the hazard of eternal perdition.</P>
<P>IN Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws again&s;t Non-conformi&s;ts repealed in 1690.</NOTE> the Revolution of 1689 was &s;till more com|plete
in the Church, than in the State. The Pre&s;byterian
wor&s;hip and form of government, as agreeable to the majo|rity
of the people, were re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; and by the acts 1690,
c. 5. and 27. all the laws again&s;t conventicles, or for en|forcing
uniformity of wor&s;hip, or e&s;tabli&s;hing the te&s;ts, and
in general, all laws prejudicial to, or derogatory from the
Pre&s;byterian model, were re&s;cinded without any re&s;ervation.
But while the peace and &s;ecurity of the new e&s;tabli&s;hment
were thus provided for; we now happily avoided the ex|ce&s;&s;es
into which the zeal of former times had betrayed us.
Papi&s;ts, indeed, &s;till continued to be marked out by new
laws, as the peculiar objects of jealou&s;y and aver&s;ion. But
no &s;tatutes for conformity were now renewed, &s;imilar to
tho&s;e of which we have taken notice, as pa&s;&s;ing on the fir&s;t
e&s;tabli&s;hment of Pre&s;bytery; nor did we even think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to imitate our neighbours of England, in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing
a te&s;t for the &s;upport of our national faith, &s;uch as that
by which with them the di&s;&s;enters from their Church are
excluded from all communion of either civil or military
tru&s;t or employment. Our only ordinance of this &s;ort, is
that very moderate provi&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1706, c. 7.</NOTE> being part of the treaty of
Union, which orders that all per&s;ons bearing office in any
univer&s;ity, college, or &s;chool, &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe the confe&s;&s;ion
of faith, and adhere to the government and di&s;cipline, of
the Pre&s;byterian Church.</P>
<P><PB N="534" REF="535">
IT was not, however, to be expected, that between the ri|val
communions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre&s;ent Laws as to Non-conformi&s;ts.</NOTE> which had &s;o long been in a &s;tate of war|fare,
and had each enjoyed the exultation of overthrowing
the other, all memory of former injuries &s;hould in&s;tantly be
effaced, and things at once &s;ub&s;ide into a &s;tate of harmony
and quiet. It appears that jealou&s;y had ari&s;en on the part of
the Pre&s;byterian pa&s;tors, with re&s;pect to the baptizing of chil|dren,
and the celebration of marriage; two articles of which
they claimed the exclu&s;ive right, to the prejudice of the
ejected Epi&s;copal clergy who had interfered with them there|in;
and who, by &s;tatute 1695, c. 12. were prohibited &s;o to do,
under pain of being impri&s;oned, till they &s;hould find caution to
leave the kingdom. On the other &s;ide, as was likely to happen;
the zeal of the Pre&s;byterians had moved them to mole&s;t and
di&s;turb the Epi&s;copal congregations, in their meetings for
religious wor&s;hip. To cut off, therefore, all doubt on &s;o in|tere&s;ting
a &s;ubject, and repre&s;s the growth of &s;uch di&s;orders,
it was thought proper, by a po&s;itive &s;tatute, to declare their
right of a&s;&s;embling for divine wor&s;hip, to be performed af|ter
their own manner; but this, under &s;uch provi&s;ions as
might &s;ecure the purity of the manners of their pa&s;tors, and
al&s;o the &s;oundne&s;s of their doctrines and principles, as well
political as eccle&s;ia&s;tical. To reconcile the&s;e two objects,
was the purpo&s;e of the &s;tatute 10. Anne, c. 7. commonly
termed <HI>the Toleration Act;</HI> which prohibits any one to mole&s;t
them in their meetings under the penalty of L. 100, to be
decreed upon conviction in the Court of Ju&s;ticiary, or other
competent Court.</P>
<P>THUS, the re&s;ult of the&s;e &s;everal changes, is in the entire
abolition of all cen&s;ures for non-conformity, either nega|tive
or po&s;itive; with the exception of the members of the
Church of Rome, and al&s;o of the members of the Church of
<PB N="535" REF="536">
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">POPERY.</NOTE> if they comply not with the rea&s;onable conditions,
which are pre&s;cribed in the Toleration Act. We are now,

<DIV3 N="5">
<HEAD>V. POPERY.</HEAD>
<P>THE rea&s;on why the members of the Roman Catholic
Church continue to be excepted from our common rule of
toleration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds of the Penal Laws again&s;t Popery.</NOTE> does not lie &s;o much in any peculiar aver&s;ion to
the articles of their &s;piritual creed; as in certain relative
principles of theirs, which are attended with a plain danger
to our civil &s;tate and con&s;titution of government. Such in
particular it is, that Popery implies the acknowledgement of
a foreign power as &s;upereminent to the Sovereignty of the&s;e
realms; and this a power, which in its very nature is at per|petual
war with our Sovereign, and with our whole frame and
political order of things. From this peculiarity of the doc|trines
of Popery, which makes them matters of the mo&s;t im|portant
temporal con&s;equence, not of con&s;cience and &s;pecu|lation
only, comes the &s;ingular &s;everity with which Papi&s;ts
are cha&s;ti&s;ed by our laws, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other
non-conformi&s;ts. A &s;everity, which I &s;hall not attempt to
vindicate from the charge of being exce&s;&s;ive in &s;ome points;
but which we &s;hall not be di&s;po&s;ed to think &s;o wonderful, if
we reflect on the long conte&s;t between the two religions, the
re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Papi&s;ts under the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, and
the many attacks which it underwent from them, and with
much difficulty with&s;tood.</P>
<P><PB N="536" REF="537">
I HAD formerly occa&s;ion to mention, that the following
offences even amount to trea&s;on:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penal Laws again&s;t Papi&s;ts.</NOTE> viz. to be reconciled to
the Pope or See of Rome; to defend the Pope's juri&s;diction
in this realm, if a per&s;on be twice convicted thereof; or for
a Popi&s;h prie&s;t, born within the dominions of the Crown,
to come over hither from beyond &s;eas, or to tarry here three
days, without conforming to the Church. But farther, any
profe&s;&s;ed Je&s;uit or &s;eminary prie&s;t, apprehended within this
realm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1587, c. 24. 1594, c. 196. 1607, c. 1. 1609, c. 5.</NOTE> is puni&s;hable with death; which pain may al&s;o be in|flicted
upon all wilful hearers of ma&s;s and concealers of
the &s;ame. As to the &s;aying of ma&s;s, which was capital in
the third offence, by 1567, c. 5.; this, by &s;everal &s;tatutes, was
rai&s;ed to the degree of trea&s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1592, c. 122. 1607, c. 1. 1661, c. 8.</NOTE> And though this provi&s;ion
has &s;ince been altered, in con&s;equence of the new &s;y&s;tem of

in our code.

the whole penal laws again&s;t Popery and Papi&s;ts,

addition to them, and the better to meet &startq;the malice and

&s;entence, for as long a time only as the pannel &s;hall continue
a Papi&s;t; and it does not, like an ordinary &s;entence of ba|ni&s;hment,
bear a warrant annexed to it, for carrying the cer|tification
into effect; but only mentions, declaratively, what
the con&s;equence &s;hall be in a certain event. It is, therefore,
a new inquiry, and matter of proof upon the pannel's re|turn,
whether or not he be &s;till a Papi&s;t, and involved in
the farther guilt which expo&s;es him to the capital &s;anc|tion;
and on the verdict to that effect, if &s;uch be found again&s;t
him, a new &s;entence and warrant of execution are nece&s;&s;ary
to be given. Now this, <HI>like every other point of guilt,</HI> can only
be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the verdict of an a&s;&s;ize. Nor will it alter
the ca&s;e, though it &s;hould even be granted that the pre&s;ump|tion
of law is again&s;t the pannel, that he has returned a
Papi&s;t. For, if he may remove this by now taking the <HI>for|mula,</HI>
which he certainly may; there &s;eems to be the &s;ame
rea&s;on as in the original trial, for tendering it in pre&s;ence
of an a&s;&s;ize. But this is a point which has never yet been
tried. Thus much with re&s;pect to the <HI>members of the Church
of Rome.</HI></P>

<HEAD>VI. OFFENCES BY EPISCOPALS.</HEAD>
<P>WITH regard to tho&s;e of the Epi&s;copal per&s;ua&s;ion. It has
been hinted, that there were rea&s;ons in the principles and
attachments of many of this communion, why the indul|gence
granted them &s;hould be guarded with due provi&s;ions for
the &s;ecurity of the State, and the civil Government of the
land. The &s;tatute 10. Anne, c. 7. requires, accordingly, &s;un|dry
equitable compliances on the part of the Epi&s;copal con|gregations,
and their pa&s;tors; without which they are not en|titled
to the benefit of the toleration, and are liable to cer|tain
penalties, if they &s;hall meet for divine wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t condition is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Want of proper Letters of Or|ders; duly Re|gi&s;tered.</NOTE> that the pa&s;tor have letters of orders
from a Prote&s;tant bi&s;hop, or, according to the later &s;tatute 19.
Geo. II. c. 38. from &s;ome bi&s;hop of the Church of England,
or of Ireland; and which letters &s;hall be produced to the
Ju&s;tices of Peace for the county or burgh, at their general
or quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions, and be there entered on record. The &s;ta|tute
of Anne has not, however, a&s;&s;igned any penalty in ca&s;e of
contravention in this particular. On which account, in the
&s;everal ca&s;es of George Fairly and others, January 6. 1718;
Oughterlony and Duguid, January 20. and 31. 1718; Daniel
Taylor and others, June 18. 1716; this part of the charge
was found relevant only to debar them from the exerci&s;e of
the clerical functions, until their letters of orders &s;hould be
produced and recorded<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Find the pannels, or any one of them, their officiating or exerci&s;ing the office of pa&s;tor, in any Epi&s;copal congregation, without producing their letters of orders from a Prote&s;tant bi&s;hop to the Ju&s;tices of Peace at their quarter|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and recording them in manner libelled, relevant to $word$ and hinder them, or any o$ them, from officiating and exerci&s;ing the &s;aid office of a pa&s;tor in any Epi&s;copal meetinghou&s;e or congregation, until their &s;aid orders be pro|duced and recorded, as is pre&s;cribed in the acts of Parliament libelled on.&endq; <HI>Interlocutor</HI> in the ca&s;e of Taylor, &amp;c.</NOTE> But by the &s;aid act of Geo.

<PB N="541" REF="542">
the regi&s;tration of any orders which are not from an Eng|li&s;h
or Iri&s;h bi&s;hop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EPISCOPAL MEETINGS.</NOTE> is declared to be null; and thus the
pa&s;tor becomes liable to the penalties appointed by that act
for officiating without regi&s;tration of the orders; that is,
&s;ix months impri&s;onment for the fir&s;t offence, and for the
&s;econd, tran&s;portation for life.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd condition by the act of Anne is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Omi&s;&s;ion to take the Oaths to Government.</NOTE> that the pa&s;|tor
have taken the oaths of allegiance and abjuration. And of
his compliance in this particular, the &s;aid act of George II.
requires him to take out a certificate from the proper officer,
(which certificate mu&s;t al&s;o bear a de&s;cription of his meet|inghou&s;e);
and to pre&s;ent it to the clerk of the county or
burgh, to be by him entered on record. In ca&s;e of failure
to take the oaths, he is liable by the act of Anne, and the
&s;tatutes there referred to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th Will. III. c. 6.</NOTE> to a fine of L. 500, and to be decla|red
incapable of his office;<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Anne, c. 14. Feb. 6. 1718.</NOTE> both which penalties were ac|cordingly
decreed again&s;t Alexander Robert&s;on, and five per|&s;ons
more. This, however, &s;eems to be altered by the &s;aid
act of George II. which, in the ca&s;e of failure to take the oaths,
or to record the certificate, inflicts the &s;ame high pains as
in the ca&s;e of failure to record the orders; and authori&s;es
Sheriffs and the Magi&s;trates of burghs to &s;hut up the doors of
&s;uch meetinghou&s;e, not again to be opened until &s;urety be
given by the owner or occupier, that the hou&s;e &s;hall not be
farther employed in the &s;ame unlawful manner.</P>
<P><PB N="542" REF="543">
A THIRD condition pre&s;cribed by the act of Anne, and
which for a time proved the occa&s;ion of more pro&s;ecutions
than either of the other two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Omi&s;&s;ion to Pray for the King. 1689, c. 16.</NOTE> was, that the clergyman at
&s;ome time during the &s;ervice, &s;hould pray in expre&s;s words
for her Maje&s;ty Queen Anne, the Prince&s;s Sophia Electre&s;s
of Hanover, and all the Royal Family: This under penalty
of L. 20 for the fir&s;t offence, and incapacity of any living
for three years, for the &s;econd. The &s;tatute 19. George II.
c. 38. in like manner requires that the King, his heirs
and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, by name, and all the Royal Family, &s;hall
be prayed for according to the form of the Liturgy of the
Church of England; under pain of &s;ix months impri&s;on|ment
for the fir&s;t offence, and tran&s;portation for the &s;econd.
For a while, many &s;ubterfuges were fallen upon by the di&s;|affected,
to avoid this violation of their con&s;cience and af|fections.
Some pa&s;tors prayed in general terms for <HI>the Royal
Family;</HI> &s;ome had a per&s;on to pray in their &s;tead; and others
thought to cut the knot by entirely omitting to pray. But
in all the&s;e devices, the po&s;itive injunction of the &s;tatute met
them; and on the acce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Hanover, many
convictions were accordingly obtained for omi&s;&s;ions in this
particular. James Lauder and James Inglis had &s;entence for
the fir&s;t offence, January 10. 1718; George Fairly, for the
&s;ame, January 18. 27. 1718; William Abercromby, and
others, for the &s;econd offence, June 22. 1717; and Daniel
Taylor, and nineteen others, for the fir&s;t offence, June 28.
1716. The pro&s;ecutions were the more numerous at that
period, as the expre&s;&s;ions of the act of Anne, wherein her
&s;ucce&s;&s;or was not mentioned by name, gave ground to argue,
that the omi&s;&s;ion to pray for King George did not fall under
the provi&s;ions there made. But the act was con&s;trued to or|der,
that the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the Crown &s;hould be prayed for;
<PB N="543" REF="544">
and it was held, that, by a proclamation which the Lords
Ju&s;tices had i&s;&s;ued on the death of Queen Anne, pointing out
the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the Crown, and ordering him to be prayed
for, the &s;tatute was &s;ufficiently applied.</P>
<P>ANOTHER expedient which had been employed to elude
the law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is deemed a Meetinghou&s;e.</NOTE> was to perform divine &s;ervice within the pa&s;tor's
own dwellinghou&s;e; but this could not, any more than the
others, be effectual, if there were the form of a public di&s;|cour&s;e,
delivered to any meeting of per&s;ons, be&s;ide the mem|bers
of the family. It was thought, however, expedient,
to lay down a preci&s;e rule on this &s;ubject, for the direction
both of the lieges and the courts of law. Therefore, the
&s;tatute 19. George II. c. 38. declares, that every place &s;hall
be deemed a meetinghou&s;e, and within the meaning of the
act, where divine &s;ervice is performed to more than five per|&s;ons
a&s;&s;embled; or, if it be a dwellinghou&s;e, to more than
five be&s;ide the members of the family. Upon this clau&s;e,
John Petrie was convicted in an inferior court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 26. 1748.</NOTE> notwith|&s;tanding
his contrivance of drawing a &s;creen cro&s;s the room,
which concealed the congregation from his view; but
through which they heard his di&s;cour&s;e, and made their re|&s;pon&s;es.
A bill of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion was refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>BESIDE the&s;e penalties, applicable to the pa&s;tor who does
not fully comply with the law, even his hearers are, by the
&s;aid act of George II. liable to &s;everal forfeitures and civil
di&s;abilities. But I find no in&s;tance of pro&s;ecution for any of
the&s;e in the records of the Criminal Court.</P>

<HEAD>VII. INTRUSION INTO CHURCHES.</HEAD>
<P>To this detail, there may properly be &s;ubjoined &s;ome no|tice
of another offence, which originated in the &s;ame war|fare
of the Pre&s;byterian and Epi&s;copal communions, and has
commonly been &s;tyled <HI>Intru&s;ion into Churches.</HI></P>
<P>IT never could be doubted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intru&s;ion made a Point of Dit|tay by Act 1695, c. 22.</NOTE> that any violent interruption of
public wor&s;hip, or any di&s;turbance what&s;oever rai&s;ed in a
church, is an aggravated &s;ort of di&s;order, by rea&s;on of the
time and place; and this, whether it were occa&s;ioned by the
private quarrel of two members of the congregation, or by
two clergymen and their adherents contending again&s;t each
other for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the building. But the proper offence
of <HI>intru&s;ion,</HI> though it may often be attended with this &s;ort
of indecent di&s;turbance, is however independent of it, and
&s;eems fir&s;t to have been formed into a point of dittay by
the &s;tatute 1695, c. 22. At the Revolution, as has been
&s;aid, the Pre&s;byterian form of wor&s;hip and Church govern|ment
had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, as agreeable to the wi&s;hes of
the greater part of the people. In this predilection the
people were, however, far from being unanimous; and
in particular, a large proportion of the gentry and bet|ter
ranks of people, were no le&s;s &s;incerely attached to the
Epi&s;copal communion, than the lower orders were di&s;po&s;ed
to idolize Pre&s;bytery. Now, as the e&s;tabli&s;hment had more
than once been altered in the cour&s;e of a century and a half;
and each party had &s;omewhat intemperately u&s;ed its advan|tage
again&s;t the other, in which way they had contracted a
mutual and &s;trong di&s;like; &s;o it is ea&s;y to conceive, that
<PB N="545" REF="546">
when the Epi&s;copal communion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">INTRUSION$INTO CHURCHES.</NOTE> which had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
for a cour&s;e of years, was now ordered to give way, (though
this was done with many circum&s;tances of indulgence towards
&s;uch pa&s;tors of that per&s;ua&s;ion as would conform<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See act 1689, c. 16.; 1693, c. 22.; 1695, c. 27.</NOTE>), a rea|dy
and univer&s;al obedience was not to be expected; and
that the new mini&s;ters might &s;tand in need of &s;ome &s;pe|cial
interpo&s;ition of the law, to &s;upport them again&s;t the at|tempts
of their competitors unwarrantably to interfere with
them in their office, or living, or the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pari&s;h
church. In that view, as al&s;o for the no le&s;s de&s;irable pur|po&s;e
of bringing things to order and regularity among the
Pre&s;byterian clergy them&s;elves, the &s;tatute above mentioned
was framed, which declares, &startq;that whoever &s;hall intrude
them&s;elves into any church, or &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s man&s;e or be|nefice,
or &s;hall exerci&s;e any part of the mini&s;terial func|tion
within any pari&s;h, without an orderly call from the
heritors and elder&s;hip, and legal admi&s;&s;ion from the Pre&s;|bytery
within who&s;e bounds it lies, &s;hall be incapable of
enjoying any church or &s;tipend, or benefice within this king|dom,
for the &s;pace of &s;even years after their removal from
the church, and quitting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tipend and be|nefice
into which they intruded.&endq;</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Violence not nece&s;&s;ary to the charge of In|tru&s;ion.</NOTE> to expo&s;e any per&s;on to the&s;e penalties, it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary,

have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with violence or tumult. If the&s;e ac|company
the fact, they are an aggravation, and a ground of
puni&s;hment, of them&s;elves; but they are not e&s;&s;ential to the
charge of <HI>intru&s;ion,</HI> which is relevantly laid upon the bare ex|erci&s;e
of the pa&s;toral functions without an orderly call and
<PB N="546" REF="547">
admi&s;&s;ion to the office. It was &s;o re&s;olved in the ca&s;e of
Gideon Guthrie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18. 1715.</NOTE> where no manner of violence was libelled;
on which ground an objection was &s;tated to the charge.</P>
<P>INDEED,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exclu&s;ion of the lawful Pa&s;tor is not nece&s;&s;ary.</NOTE> it is not even requi&s;ite that the Pre&s;byterian
pa&s;tor be interfered with, or excluded from the church.
Though the intruder perform divine &s;ervice on a day
when there is to be no &s;ervice by the e&s;tabli&s;hed mini&s;ter,
he is &s;till within the purview of the act; becau&s;e he a&s;&s;umes
the character of pa&s;tor of that pari&s;h, which is one, and
does not belong to him; and takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the church,
whereof the u&s;e pertains exclu&s;ively to the e&s;tabli&s;hed mini|&s;ter
and his communion. And herein it is,&mdash;in this u&s;urpa|tion
of a certain character, and the exerci&s;e of public functions
which have not been conferred on him,&mdash;that the &s;candal and
audacity of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion lies. In this point al&s;o the in|terlocutor

of title, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the church; he is &s;till an intrude$

vacant church, was that in which the u&s;urpation would mo&s;t
frequently happen, and for which the enactment was chiefly
meant; as the preamble it&s;elf informs us. Sentence was

<P>IT is al&s;o clear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. and July 6. &amp; 23. 1714.</NOTE> upon the words of the &s;tatute, that it is
not by preaching only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Any A&s;&s;ump|tion of the Of|fice is &s;ufficient.</NOTE> but by public exerci&s;e of any part of
the mini&s;terial function, nay even by a&s;&s;uming po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
man&s;e or benefice, that intru&s;ion may be committed. It is
true, that tho&s;e of the Epi&s;copal communion are indulged by
the Toleration Act, with the free exerci&s;e of all the pa&s;toral
functions; but &s;till only in their own peculiar and regi&s;tered
place of wor&s;hip, in which and which alone they are forbid|den
to be di&s;turbed: So that if the Epi&s;copal prie&s;t &s;hould

of the dead, within the pari&s;h church-yard, he is in the pre|dicament
pre&s;cribed by the act: for he is &s;ub&s;tituting his own
in place of the national communion. In the cafe of Sharp,
and in that of Guthrie, a relevancy is therefore found again&s;t

<P>To make a relevant charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Intru&s;ion mu&s;t be pre|donious.</NOTE> the intruder mu&s;t, however,

perhaps known to the per&s;on him&s;elf to be &s;o; this will be
&s;ufficient to defend him in a pro&s;ecution for the &s;tatutory
pains, which to one engaged in the profe&s;&s;ion of clergyman
are &s;evere, and were only meant for the ca&s;e of a plain pre|donious
occupier of the church or living. This is illu&s;trated
in the ca&s;e of Mr William Duguid;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 16, 17, 18, 19. 1713.</NOTE> who, after having en|tered
to preach in a certain church as probationer, by li|cen&s;e
of the pre&s;bytery of the bounds, and after being in the
cour&s;e of admi&s;&s;ion to the benefice upon call and pre&s;enta|tion,
had in the end been deprived of his licen&s;e by the Ge|neral
A&s;&s;embly; but had neverthele&s;s per&s;i&s;ted to preach,
under colour of &s;ome vice in the &s;entence of A&s;&s;embly, and
the intimation thereof to him. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, the
pro&s;ecutor found it proper judicially to pa&s;s from the &s;tatu|tory
penalties, and limit his conclu&s;ions to the bare removal
of Mr Duguid from the church, until he &s;hould be lawfully
admitted; which was accordingly decreed upon conviction.
On the other &s;ide, the appearance at lea&s;t of an order|ly

<P>IT may here be a&s;ked, concerning tho&s;e lay offenders who
a&s;&s;i&s;t the clergyman in his intru&s;ion, and to whom the penal|ties
in the &s;tatute will not &s;o properly apply; are they there|fore
to pa&s;s entirely unpuni&s;hed? This con&s;equence by no
means follows. If any outrage or tumult happens in ac|compli&s;hing
the intru&s;ion; for this, the per&s;ons concerned concerned are
of cour&s;e liable to puni&s;hment, and the more by rea&s;on of the
nature of the occa&s;ion which gives ri&s;e to the di&s;turbance.
But even if there be no violence; &s;till all &s;uch proceedings
as naturally make a per&s;on art and part of the intru&s;ion, are,
as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the &s;tatute which creates that
offence, &s;ubject to &s;uch cen&s;ure as the ca&s;e &s;hall &s;eem to de|&s;erve.
And this has more than once been re&s;olved. In the
ca&s;e of Kenneth Mackenzie, and others, Magi&s;trates of Elgin,
it was found relevant to infer an arbitrary pain, damages and
expences again&s;t the Magi&s;trates, that they had turned out the
e&s;tabli&s;hed mini&s;ter, and put an Epi&s;copal prie&s;t in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the church; and again&s;t James Ru&s;&s;ell, that, being
entru&s;ted with the keys of the church, he delivered up the
&s;ame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 9. &amp; 24. and March 2. 1713.</NOTE> or made the church patent to the intruder. On con|viction,
they were fined in L. 20 Sterling, and decerned to
pay L. 30 of co&s;ts. In the ca&s;e al&s;o of Old Machar, Me&s;&s;rs
Fra&s;er and Black, ma&s;ters of King's College, Aberdeen, who,
as patrons, had given a pre&s;entation to the intruder, an Epi&s;|copal
divine, and an unqualified per&s;on, were found liable in
L. 50 of co&s;ts; were &s;ent to gaol for ten days; and ordered
<PB N="551" REF="552">
to find caution not to trouble the Pre&s;byterian communion
in its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the church and pari&s;h of Old Machar in
time to come. Certain other per&s;ons, who had aided in
breaking up the door of the church, were likewi&s;e &s;ent to
gaol, and put under &s;urety to the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>IN terms of the &s;tatute 1695,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Pro|&s;ecution for In|tru&s;ion.</NOTE> the pro&s;ecutor for intru&s;ion,

with a warrant from them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9. 1713.</NOTE> In the ca&s;e of William Duguid, it
&s;eems, however, to have been held, that the Moderator, and
two members of Pre&s;bytery, might pro&s;ecute in their name,
though not furni&s;hed with any &s;pecial authority. In mo&s;t
ca&s;es, along with the Pre&s;bytery, the Procurator for the
Church has appeared, as having a plain title, from the na|ture
of his office; and in &s;ome in&s;tances he has been the &s;ole
pro&s;ecutor, without either the authority of concurrence of

<P>UPON the words of the &s;aid act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Judge in Trial for Intru&s;ion.</NOTE> it might &s;eem at fir&s;t
view, that the cogni&s;ance of charges for intru&s;ion is at|tributed
to the inferior courts, in exclu&s;ion of the Supreme.
But the true purpo&s;e of the provi&s;ion there made in that be|half,
was to declare the competency of the inferior Judges,
for the &s;ake of &s;peedy trial, if the pro&s;ecutor cho&s;e. It ap|pears,
however, that in practice advantage was not taken of
this permi&s;&s;ion; for from 1709 to 1719, the records of Ju&s;ti|ciary
are full of trials for intru&s;ion; in mo&s;t of which very
keen, but tedious and unin&s;tructive debates took place.</P>

<HEAD>IX. WITCHCRAFT.</HEAD>
<P>WE cannot properly clo&s;e this catalogue of offences again&s;t
God and religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Authorities for the Belief of Witchcraft.</NOTE> without adding a few words re&s;pecting one
which unhappily occupies a very large portion of our Cri|minal
records, the crime of &s;orcery, or witchcraft; which
con&s;i&s;ted in holding communion with the grand enemy of
mankind, or with evil &s;pirits. This, in the &s;ight of tho&s;e
who believed in &s;uch an intercour&s;e, was of cour&s;e one
of the mo&s;t abominable offences of the high cla&s;s of which
we are now treating; &s;ince, according to the common no|tions
of it, it implied a renunciation of bapti&s;m, and Chri|&s;tianity,
and of God Almighty; an acknowledgment of the
devil for &s;overeign and ma&s;ter in his &s;tead; and an upgiving
of the &s;ervant's &s;oul and body into the power and di&s;po&s;al
of Satan; all of them acts of the mo&s;t horrid wickedne&s;s
and impiety. Be&s;ides, this compact was &s;uppo&s;ed to be com|monly
entered into, for the purpo&s;e of acquiring preter|natural
powers, which were to be u&s;ed by the pupil for pur|po&s;es
of mi&s;chief and revenge. If real, it was thus, in every
point of view, a mon&s;trous and fearful offence, and the &s;it
&s;ubject of the mo&s;t exemplary vengeance that could be ap|plied
to it. And that it was no illu&s;ion, but a po&s;&s;ible, real,
and frequent crime, our ance&s;tors were not &s;ingular in be|lieving;
but had to countenance them in that opinion, the
<PB N="555" REF="556">
law and ordinary cu&s;tom of all the nations of Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WITCHCRAFT.</NOTE> without
exception even of tho&s;e which were held to be mo&s;t enlighten|ed.
The&s;e appealed, too, in &s;upport of their practice, to certain
pa&s;&s;ages of the Holy Scriptures, which were alleged to coun|tenance
the belief of &s;uch a thing; as al&s;o to the example of
the Roman law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Cod. lib. 9. tit. 18. 1. 2. 3. 5. 6. 7. 8.</NOTE>, which &s;poke of the <HI>ars mathematica</HI> as &startq;<HI>dam|nabilis
et omnino interdicta;</HI>&endq; and condemned the practition|ers
therein, of all de&s;criptions, to die by fire, as enemies
of the human race; as well as it puni&s;hed with death, all
who &s;hould con&s;ult any magician or &s;ooth&s;ayer, or attempt

<P>THE lawyers of foreign countries had accordingly be&s;tow|ed
no little pains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots Statute puni&s;hed it with Death.</NOTE> in a thorough analy&s;is of this dreaded im|piety;
&s;eparating the different cla&s;&s;es of wizards and necro|mancers,
(of which <HI>Carp&s;ovius</HI> enumerates &s;ix); inve&s;tigating
the <HI>indicia</HI> of the guilt; and devi&s;ing the rules of evidence
and trial, that might be mo&s;t &s;uitable to each kind of mali|fice
and enchantment: In all which inquiries, much &s;ubtle|ty
is employed, and even great preci&s;ion attempted to be
attained. No wonder then, that in this ruder and more ig|norant
corner of the world, &s;o popular a &s;uper&s;tition found an
ea&s;y and univer&s;al reception, not only with the lower ranks,
but with the Legi&s;lature of the country. There is but one
&s;tatute on the &s;ubject, the act 1563, c. 73. which appoints the
pain of death to be executed as well upon the &s;eeker or em|ployer
as the u&s;er of &s;orcery; and &s;eems to have been equal|ly
<PB N="556" REF="557">
calculated for the ca&s;e of him who was really an adept in
the craft, and of him who fal&s;ely pretended to po&s;&s;e&s;s it.
There &s;eems, however, to have been little need of any provi|&s;ion
conceived in &s;uch exten&s;ive terms. For among the many
trials for witchcraft which &s;ill the record, I have not ob|&s;erved
that there is even one which proceeds upon the no|tion
of a vain or cheating art, fal&s;ely u&s;ed by an impo&s;tor
to deceive the weak and credulous. In all of them, there is
either a charge of preternatural powers acquired by the
&s;eeker of &s;orcery; or at lea&s;t a charge of actual communi|cation
with Satan and other evil &s;pirits; and this &s;tated in
&s;uch a manner as bears evidence of a full a&s;&s;ent to the e&s;&s;i|cacy
of tho&s;e impious practices, and marks the horror which
was felt of the irre&s;i&s;tible and dreadful dominion that might
be gained and conferred in this way of intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>I DO not intend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Detail of the Law unne|ce&s;&s;ary.</NOTE> (it would be of no u&s;e, and &s;urely it
could not be amu&s;ing), to enter into a detail of the law in
this melancholy and humiliating article; which unhappily
is one of the longe&s;t, the mo&s;t laboured, and the fulle&s;t of
adjudged ca&s;es, of any in the whole circuit of our Criminal
practice. Mackenzie, in that chapter of his treati&s;e which re|lates
to witchcraft, has given us &s;ufficient information of mi|&s;erable
con&s;equences of this &s;trange delu&s;ion; and of the vain
and ineffectual precautions by which our Judges attempted
to guard them&s;elves again&s;t error or precipitancy, in a mat|ter
where even they, believing as they did in the reality of
the crime, &s;aw, however, that they had to tread upon &s;o
foul and treacherous a bottom. Tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of
a &s;till fuller knowledge of this afflicting &s;ort of hi&s;tory, may
have recour&s;e to the volume of reports by Mr Arnot; who has
<PB N="557" REF="558">
been at pains in collecting &s;ome of the mo&s;t noted and ex|traordinary
trials.</P>
<P>SUFFICE it to &s;ay in general, (without engaging in the re|lation
of the &s;ufferings of helple&s;s and inoffen&s;ive creatures),
that it cannot &s;urpri&s;e us if men lo&s;t all &s;ight of rea&s;on, and
of the ordinary rules of ju&s;tice, in the execution of a part of
the law which was founded altogether upon ignorance and
terror.</P>
<P>IT would have been dangerous enough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Received Grounds of Witchcraft.</NOTE> if the charge of
witchcraft had even been confined to tho&s;e &s;ituations of vi|&s;ible
mi&s;chief or calamity, whereof the circum&s;tances might
&s;erve as grounds of inquiry, and in &s;ome, though an improper
&s;en&s;e, as a <HI>corpus delicti</HI> in the ca&s;e. But no &s;uch limitation
was received into practice. It was not only to account for
&s;trange events, or &s;uch as were out of the ordinary cour&s;e of na|ture,
and which might move the fears and pa&s;&s;ions of men,
that this &s;upernatural agency was re&s;orted to: Neither was it
only called in aid on occa&s;ion of rare and uncommon ca&s;ual|ties,
&s;uch as the burning of a man's hou&s;e, or the wreck of his
&s;hip at &s;ea; or on occa&s;ion of tho&s;e events, &s;uch as lo&s;s of
health, or failure of credit, which though familiar, are, how|ever,
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e concerned. Every thing that cro&s;|&s;ed
a per&s;on in his pur&s;uits, or that did not happen according
to his wi&s;hes, was held equally relevant: As, for in&s;tance,
that &s;uch a man's boat caught no fi&s;h, when other boats were
&s;ucce&s;sful; or that &s;uch a woman's corn yielded le&s;s meal,
or her cows gave le&s;s milk, than tho&s;e of her neighbours.
They &s;topped not even here, with <HI>indicia</HI> like the&s;e, which,
were at lea&s;t tangible facts, and capable of being a&s;certain|ed
in the way of ordinary proof; but al&s;o received the
charge of witchcraft, and even more frequently than other|wi&s;e,
upon &s;uch grounds as had never been exhibited in any
<PB N="558" REF="559">
outward or palpable occurrence at all; and only for the fir&s;t
time came to light, by the confe&s;&s;ion of the pannel and
his a&s;&s;ociates as to their intercour&s;e with the other world.
Thus the following were all undoubted articles of dittay:
To enter into a paction with the devil to &s;erve him; to call
him up and confer with him; to be baptized by him, or re|ceive
his gifts; as al&s;o, which was often charged, and &s;ome|times
found proved, to join with him in carnal copulation.
It would be tedious to recount the numerous in&s;tances of
the&s;e and the like crazy dreams and revelations, which were
propagated and believed &s;o much the more greedily, in pro|portion
as they were extravagant and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>SUCH as was the &s;ub&s;tance of the charge;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mode of Inquiry as to Witchcraft.</NOTE> &s;uch al&s;o was the
procedure again&s;t the abhorred offender, and the proofs ad|mitted
to &s;ub&s;tantiate his guilt; in both of which all &s;ight
was lo&s;t, not only of all ordinary rules, but of humanity and
common &s;en&s;e. The taking inqui&s;ition concerning witchcraft
was not confined to Magi&s;trates and Judges, who might be &s;up|po&s;ed
&s;omewhat more competent to &s;uch inve&s;tigations; but
was given, at lea&s;t was permitted, almo&s;t to all per&s;ons in any
&s;ort of authority, and e&s;pecially to clergymen and kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ions;
who &s;eem to have proceeded upon common fame, or other
the like loo&s;e ground, and before whom, in particular, mo&s;t
of the many fatal confe&s;&s;ions that were made by the accu|&s;ed,
&s;eem to have been obtained. Al&s;o, the ordinary judi|catures
were &s;et a&s;ide, even as to the trial of the crime.
For though it was held that the inferior judges were not
competent to the conducting of &s;o nice an inquiry, the ac|cu&s;ed
had truly no advantage in this rule: on the contrary he
<PB N="559" REF="560">
was &s;o much the more hardly dealt with; as the trial in con|&s;equence
was often delegated to Commi&s;&s;ioners who were
named by the Privy Council, and were not uncommonly
taken from among the gentry of the parts where the <HI>fame</HI>
of the witchcraft had ari&s;en. No fewer than fourteen com|mi&s;&s;ions
for trial of witches were granted for different quar|ters
of the country, in one &s;ederunt of the 7th of November
1661; which year &s;eems to have been the mo&s;t fertile period
of this &s;ort of accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the circum&s;tances of evidence which were
held to be relevant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Evi|dence in the Trial.</NOTE> or the competent ways of proving tho&s;e
circum&s;tances; it may truly be &s;aid, that &s;carce any &s;ettled
di&s;tinction was ob&s;erved. If the pannel had uttered threats
again&s;t the accu&s;er; one could not much wonder that this
was held to be an ingredient of &s;u&s;picion. Or, if a per&s;on were
found making u&s;e of charms and ceremonies; it was &s;till
le&s;s to be admired, that this was &s;u&s;tained as undoubted evi|dence
of guilt. But the in&s;tances are frequent of the like con|clu&s;ion
being drawn from circum&s;tances, either quite trifling
and accidental, or which &s;eem to have no peculiar connection
with the events that are attributed to them in the libel. As
for in&s;tance, that a per&s;on was taken ill, or became well, (for
that made no manner of difference), &s;oon after &s;peaking to, or
touching the pannel, or upon her pa&s;&s;ing the hou&s;e, or co|ming
into the neighbourhood. There was, indeed, hardly
any thing &s;o familiar, upon which &s;u&s;picion did not fa&s;ten. If
a woman pro&s;pered in the world more than her neighbours
&s;aw cau&s;e for, or perhaps wi&s;hed; or if &s;he kept her health
in a &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on; or were not to be found at any time when
&s;he was &s;ought for; it behoved her, by the rules of this
<PB N="560" REF="561">
code, to be in company with the devil, and to be one of his
&s;ervants. Along with other means, u&s;e was made of pre&s;ump|tions,
drawn from certain marks upon the body, or from the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of certain things or implements, which, how ordi|nary
&s;oever the nature and u&s;e of them, were agreed to be the
gifts of the devil, or &s;ymptoms of witchcraft: or the accu&s;ed
was &s;ubjected to certain &s;ummary experiments, as by throw|ing
into water with the hands and feet bound, and the like.</P>
<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof by Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Party.</NOTE> &s;trange as it may appear, the prime and the ordina|ry
mode of evidence, was that which in common ca&s;es is the
be&s;t of any; but which in this had not the &s;ame advantage,
both by rea&s;on of the nature of the crime, as to which a
crazy imagination might quite impo&s;e on the accu&s;ed; and
&s;till more by rea&s;on of the &s;hameful and cruel means, which
&s;eem to have been too commonly employed to obtain it: I
mean the canfe&s;&s;ion of party. Torture, of one kind or
other, &s;eems to have been freely made u&s;e of. The mo&s;t
common mode of it was the thru&s;ting of pins into the body,
and the denial of &s;leep for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days and nights;
both of which expedients, as far as I can judge, were often
employed, not as in other ca&s;es, under the &s;pecial direction
of the Ju&s;ticiary or Privy Council, but at the di&s;cretion of
the Commi&s;&s;ion, or other judicature, not excepting mini|&s;ters
and kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ions, who took charge of the preparatory
inqui&s;ition. The art of conducting this &s;ort of <HI>quae&s;tion</HI> was

<P>ALL the&s;e things duly con&s;idered; the pre&s;ent mi&s;ery;
the long con&s;inement; the &s;mall hope of acquittal; the ri&s;k
of a new charge and pro&s;ecution; and the certain lo&s;s of all
comfort and connection in &s;ociety; there will be le&s;s rea&s;on to
wonder at the numerous convictions of witchcraft which were
obtained on the confe&s;&s;ion of party. Add to the&s;e cau&s;es,
though of them&s;elves &s;ufficient, the influence of another, as
powerful perhaps as any of them; the un&s;ound and crazy &s;tate
of imagination in many of the&s;e unhappy victims them&s;elves.
In tho&s;e times, when all the inhabitants of this country, with|out
exception even of the mo&s;t intelligent, were thoroughly
per&s;uaded of the truth of witchcraft, and of the po&s;&s;ibility
of acquiring preternatural powers, it &s;eems nowi&s;e impro|bable
that individuals would &s;ometimes be found, who, ei|ther
&s;eeking to indulge their malice, or &s;timulated by cu|rio&s;ity
and an irregular imagination, did actually court and
&s;olicit a communication with evil &s;pirits, by the means
which in tho&s;e days were reputed to be effectual for &s;uch a
purpo&s;e. And it is po&s;&s;ible, that among the&s;e there might be
&s;ome, who, in the cour&s;e of long and earne&s;t employment
in &s;uch a pur&s;uit, came at la&s;t to be far enough di&s;ordered,
<PB N="562" REF="563">
to mi&s;take their own dreams and ravings, or hy&s;teric affec|tions,
for the actual interviews and impre&s;&s;ions of Satan.</P>
<P>I WILL not enlarge farther on &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;ub|ject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro&s;ecution for Witchcraft for|bidden by Sta|tute.</NOTE>
The crime it&s;elf was ca&s;t out of the law, by the &s;ta|tute
of the 9. of Geo. II. c. 5. which di&s;charges all pro|&s;ecutions
for witchcraft, or for imputing witchcraft to an|other

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LORD ROYSTON's NOTE
ON THE
CASE of Mrs NISBET<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Referred to vol. i. p. 241.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FALSEHOOD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Expre&s;sly to condemn,</HI> &amp;c. This opinion was &s;o gene|rally
taken to be good law, that when in a late ca&s;e it was
called in que&s;tion, it was look't on as a novelty, and a
&s;ingular opinion again&s;t a received and fix't rule in law.
However, if we examine it, it will be found to be without
foundation, or good authority. The fir&s;t time it was called
in que&s;tion was in Margaret Ni&s;bet's ca&s;e, July 1726, who
was found, upon a complaint exhibit again&s;t her at the in|&s;tance
of one Hender&s;on, with concour&s;e of the Lord Ad|vocate,
to have forged a bill for L. 58 Sterling, &s;aid to be
drawn by &s;aid Hender&s;on, and accepted by the Dutches
of Gordon, and indor&s;ed by him to Margaret Ni&s;bet; and
to have forged a declaration by &s;aid Hender&s;on, by which
he acknowledged that he had truely indor&s;ed &s;aid bill; all
which was made appear to have been contrived by her, by
inducing one Hu&s;band <HI>alias</HI> Cameron to per&s;onate and a&s;&s;ume
Hender&s;on's name, and &s;ign the declaration before witne&s;&s;es.
When it came to be advi&s;ed, the que&s;tion was, Whether &s;he
<PB N="575" REF="576">
&s;hould be puni&s;hed arbitrary by the Lords, or remitted to
the Ju&s;ticiary; &s;ome out of compa&s;&s;ion to her &s;ex, and that
the bill was never made u&s;e of in judgment or abidden by,
were for the milder &s;entence; others, becau&s;e of the artfull
contrivance and atrocity of the forgery, by which an in|nocent
per&s;on was put in hazard of his life, by being very
near found guilty of the forgery, thought &s;he ju&s;tly de&s;er|ved
the highe&s;t puni&s;hment. To reconcile the&s;e two opi|nions,
I &s;aid, that it appeared that tho&s;e who inclined mo&s;t
to favour her were of opinion &s;he de&s;erved the highe&s;t ar|bitrary
puni&s;hment, even &s;uch as could not be inflicted by
any civil Judge, &s;uch as amputation of a member, which
was an ordinary puni&s;hment for this crime by the practice
of nations: That therefore I was of opinion &s;he &s;hould be
remitted to the Ju&s;ticiary. To this it was &s;aid, that in this
ca&s;e the Ju&s;ticiary were tied down to puni&s;h her with death,
and cited this pa&s;&s;age for &s;upport of this opinion. To this
I an&s;wered, that though I had great re&s;pect for the opinion
of that eminent lawyer; yet I could not in this agree with
him, unle&s;s it could be made appear that it was &s;upported
either by expre&s;s &s;tatute or precedents, neither of which did
appear to me. Nor is it ea&s;y to conceive that any law would
tye down one Sovereign Court implicitly to follow the opi|nion
of a co-ordinate judicature, e&s;pecially in a que&s;tion
that properly belonged to their own cogni&s;ance, and to leave
them no other power than to pronounce &s;entence of death.
This is not to give them a power to act as judges, but as
executioners; an office very unbecoming the dignity of a
Sovereign Court. E&s;pecially in this crime of fal&s;ehood,
which has no fix't or determined puni&s;hment, but is greater
or le&s;s according to the degree of the crime, and, as the
<PB N="576" REF="577">
civil law terms it, <HI>pro modo admi&s;&s;i,</HI> nor does any of our acts of
Parliament once mention the pain of death, but refers to the
puni&s;hment by the laws, civil and canon; by which fir&s;t
law it was arbitrary, and the pain of death &s;eldom inflicted,
but on <HI>per&s;onae viles,</HI> as I have noticed on another place of
this title; &s;o that it is plain death is not the <HI>paena ordinaria</HI>
of this crime, but rather indeed <HI>extraordinaria.</HI> Two things
I apprehend have given ri&s;e to this opinion. The fir&s;t is, that
it was thought the Ju&s;ticiary could not judge this crime <HI>in pri|ma
in&s;tantia,</HI> and &s;o &s;ays our author, &sect; 4. <HI>h. t.;</HI> but this is a
mi&s;take, nor does the deci&s;ion in Macculloch's ca&s;e, which he
cites, &s;upport it, as will appear by looking into it. On the
contrary, there are &s;everal deci&s;ions of late where the com|potency
of the Court <HI>in prima in&s;tantia</HI> being objected to,
it was expre&s;sly over-ruled and repelled, of which I have
given in&s;tances in <HI>Ob&s;. ad d. par.</HI> 4. The &s;econd thing that
&s;eemed to &s;upport this opinion is, that there were no in&s;tan|ces
where the Ju&s;tices inflicted a le&s;&s;er puni&s;hment than
death in the ca&s;e of &s;uch remitts; and though this were true
in fact, it does not conclude; for it may be, that all who
were remitted to them were &s;o atrocious as ju&s;tly to de&s;erve
that puni&s;hment. But neither does it hold in fact, there being
many in&s;tances on record where arbitrary puni&s;hments were
inflicted; of which I &s;hall give &s;ome, as Croy, 15th March
1605, for being a fal&s;e witne&s;s, only &s;courged. <HI>It.</HI> 28th ditto,
Strachan a me&s;&s;enger, for giving &s;everal fal&s;e executions and
denunciations, was only depo&s;ed and whipped. <HI>It.</HI> 4th July
1638, For&s;yth a notary, for forging a charter, was &s;et on the
Cro&s;s and bani&s;hed. <HI>It.</HI> 27th February 1650, Law&s;on and
Blair, two nottars, for forging a di&s;charge and remit by the
Se&s;&s;ion to the Ju&s;tices, to be judged according to law;
Law&s;on was only declared infamous, his ear nailed to the
<PB N="577" REF="578">
Trone, and bani&s;hed; and as to Blair, the Ju&s;tices petitioned
the Parliament to have their opinion what puni&s;hment to
inflict on him, who gave their opinion he &s;hould be hanged;
which &s;entence was accordingly pronounced. The&s;e in&s;tan|ces
fully make it appear, that the Ju&s;tices did not think
them&s;elves tyed down to pronounce &s;entence of death on
every one who was remit to them for fal&s;ehood by the Se&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mrs Ni&s;bet having been remit to the Ju&s;ticiary, the King's
lawyers did not in&s;i&s;t on the argument that the indytement
&s;hould be found relevant to infer the pain of death, becau&s;e
it was remitted; but becau&s;e of the atrocity of the crime.
But the pannell's lawyers did inform upon it. The Lords,
at advi&s;ing, were of opinion, that they were not tyed down
by the remit, but were ab&s;olutely at liberty to inflict what
puni&s;hment they judged the crime de&s;erved. But becau&s;e it
was not pled by the pro&s;ecutors, no notice is taken of it in
the interlocutor; however &s;he was &s;entenced to be hanged,
<HI>et merito.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what the author &s;ays here in page 195.
<HI>inf.</HI> he &s;ays, that the Se&s;&s;ion in their remit qualify the decree
of the puni&s;hment they are to inflict, as &s;courging, &amp;c. ac|cording
to the degree of the guilt; which is more rea&s;onable
than what he here a&s;&s;erts, that in all remitts they mu&s;t con|demn
to death, without di&s;tinction of the degree of the
guilt.</P>

had any complaints to make again&s;t the Sheriff-deputes; Mr

again&s;t the &s;aid William Colville, oppre&s;&s;ive and illegal; in

<P>The alternate charge of murder or culpable
homicide, not cu&s;tomary till of late. Is an improvement.
Libel is relevant in both charges. I think the facts, <HI>if proved
as charged,</HI> infer murder. In&s;trument in it&s;elf deadly&mdash;point|ed
up a public lane&mdash;fired there in day-time&mdash;firing at a
multitude is murder;&mdash;though there be no &s;pecial enmity at
any one. If the pannel's &s;tate of facts be proved, it will only
reduce the guilt to culpable homicide: It was found &s;o in a
ca&s;e tried before me at Stirling, where the gun was only
<HI>wadded,</HI> and the wadding killed.</P>

<PB N="582" REF="583">
<SPEAKER>Swinton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where there is an <HI>animus injuriandi,</HI> though not

there is not even an <HI>animus injuriandi.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ju&s;tice-Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be murder without malice or
&s;pecial enmity at a certain per&s;on. Wilfully to fire a load|ed
gun in the &s;treets of a burgh in the day-time, that is mur|der.
If it be proved that the pannel loaded, as he thought,
with powder only, &s;till the homicide will be culpable; for it
was a great fault to fire there at all, con&s;idering the ri&s;k of
accidents. So I am for finding the <HI>murder</HI> libelled relevant
to infer death, and the culpable <HI>homicide</HI> relevant to infer an
arbitrary pain; and allow a proof, &amp;c.</P>
