<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN my <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> on <HI>Regimen,</HI> I promi&s;ed
the World my Thoughts concern|ing,
<HI>The natural Method of cureing
the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Body, and the Di&s;orders
of the Mind re&s;ulting from &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI>
on the Principles of <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> laid
down in that <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> which, by a Cour&s;e
of fifty Years Study, I have di&s;cover'd
to be the mo&s;t <HI>Rational,</HI> and in forty
Years <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI> have found
them to be the mo&s;t <HI>Effectual.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> I have in the <HI>follow|ing
Sheets</HI> endeavour'd to perform,
whether to the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>Benefit</HI>
of the <HI>Public, Time</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI>
<PB REF="3">
mu&s;t &s;hew. To a <HI>Delicacy</HI> of <HI>Senti|ments</HI>
and <HI>Correctne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Style,</HI> I have
&s;mall Preten&s;ions; to convey my own
<HI>Thoughts</HI> to others, with as much <HI>Plain|ne&s;s</HI>
and <HI>Per&s;picuity</HI> as my Subject
would admit of, has been my <HI>principal
View;</HI> and if the &s;erious attentive
<HI>Reader</HI> finds him&s;elf in&s;tructed, the
Intention of the Writer is an&s;wered,
and his Credit, as a <HI>Pen-man,</HI> is of &s;mall
Import.</P>
<P><HI>NATURE</HI> and her <HI>Laws,</HI> a com|petent
Knowledge of the <HI>animal Oeco|nomy,</HI>
and the be&s;t <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> which
I have been capable of makeing on
my own <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> in Practice, or on
that of the able&s;t of my <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> are
the Foundation of every thing by me
advanced. <HI>Theory</HI> I have given into
as far only as &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to
reconcile the <HI>Method</HI> and <HI>Medicins</HI> by
<PB REF="4">
me recommended, to the true&s;t <HI>Idea</HI>
which I could frame of the Di&s;temper
to be cured: For the re&s;t, the <HI>Reader</HI>
is referred to the <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> above-menti|oned,
and its <HI>Appendages.</HI></P>
<P>IN a De&s;ign exten&s;ive as this, it
will not be expected that I &s;hould
de&s;cend either into <HI>Forms</HI> of <HI>Medicins,</HI>
or the particular Circum&s;tances of
every <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> under Con&s;ideration;
this will be the nece&s;&s;ary Duty of the
<HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> in ordinary, who, if he ap|proves
the general Directions by me
given, will readily adapt them to any
particular Ca&s;e, its <HI>Degrees</HI> and <HI>Sym|ptoms.</HI></P>
<P>IT cannot, I &s;hould hope, give any
rea&s;onable <HI>Offence,</HI> if in a Work of this
Kind, many particular Things &s;hould
occur, which probably I may have
<PB REF="5">
already advanced in &s;ome former <HI>Trea|ti&s;es;</HI>
my <HI>Apology</HI> for which is, that
in all I know of <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI> I have but one
general <HI>Sy&s;tem; Nature</HI> being ever <HI>one</HI>
and the &s;ame, and proceeding in all
<HI>animal Functions</HI> and Operations by
the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> or at lea&s;t by analogous
<HI>Laws.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT I learned from <HI>Books, Spe|culation</HI>
and <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> by Trial and
Experience I have found to be greatly
<HI>defective,</HI> as well in many Di&s;tempers,
whereof I my&s;elf have felt the Weight,
as in the Ca&s;es of my <HI>Patients;</HI> and
this <HI>Experience</HI> has led me to throw
off all <HI>un&s;ucce&s;sful</HI> Methods and <HI>Me|dicins,</HI>
and to confine my&s;elf to <HI>&s;uch</HI>
only, by which I had Rea&s;on to think
the principal <HI>Point</HI> in View, <HI>viz.</HI> a
<HI>la&s;ting Cure,</HI> might be obtained. This
Method of proceeding reduces the
<PB REF="6">
<HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> into a narrow Com|pa&s;s,
<HI>viz.</HI> 1&deg;. To proper <HI>Evacuations</HI>
of the &s;everal proper Kinds. 2&deg;. To
<HI>attenuating</HI> and <HI>deob&s;truent</HI> Medicins,
of which I find the <HI>mild pondero&s;e</HI> to
be generally the be&s;t; and after a due
U&s;e of the&s;e, 3&deg;. The gentle <HI>A&s;trin|gents</HI>
and <HI>Strengtheners</HI> of the Solids,
4&deg;. A proper and <HI>&s;pecific Diet,</HI> with
<HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Exerci&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is my general <HI>Sy&s;tem:</HI> This,
if ju&s;t and &s;olid, brings all that can
be pertinently &s;aid on the <HI>Cure</HI> of Di&s;|tempers,
into an ea&s;y and intelligible
View, and makes many of the <HI>&s;ame</HI>
Methods and Medicins common to
different <HI>Ca&s;es</HI> and <HI>Patients.</HI> Whatever
exceeds this, is <HI>calculated</HI> either for the
ea&s;y Death, or to keep up the Courage
and Hopes, of the <HI>Patient.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="7">
IT would not become me to &s;ay,
that the Method here laid down, how
judiciou&s;ly &s;oever applied, will in every
<HI>Ca&s;e</HI> ab&s;olutely cure or &s;ave: This, how|ever,
I venture to affirm, <HI>viz.</HI> that the
Continuance of this Method for a due
Time, has done, in very bad Ca&s;es,
and, by <HI>GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> will do more
than any other which has yet been
&s;o &s;trongly and clearly enforced and
explained, or is commonly u&s;ed.</P>
<P>I MAY be deceiv'd my&s;elf, but, if
I know my own Heart, have not
a &s;ingle <HI>Temptation</HI> to deceive others.
My <HI>Age</HI> is little &s;hort of &s;eventy Years,
at which Time in Life, a <HI>Thought</HI> of
adding to my <HI>Reputation,</HI> or to my
<HI>Pur&s;e,</HI> would be extreme Folly: The
<HI>fir&s;t</HI> is now at the Di&s;po&s;al of the
<PB REF="8">
<HI>Public,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> will &s;oon be in the
Hands of my <HI>Executors.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Rules have I followed for
twenty Years, fir&s;t and la&s;t; and, by
the <HI>Mercy of Heaven,</HI> am at this Time
happy, in the Enjoyment of my
Sen&s;es, and the <HI>Faculties</HI> of <HI>my Mind,</HI>
in their full <HI>Vigour.</HI></P>
<P>BUT after all, though I &s;hould <HI>con|vince</HI>
the World, I mu&s;t not expect to
<HI>convert</HI> it: Le&s;&s;ons of <HI>Ab&s;tinence</HI> and
<HI>Self-denial</HI> loo&s;e their <HI>Weight,</HI> when
offered to &s;trong <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>high
Spirits;</HI> and the greate&s;t Part of my
<HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> will probably always be &s;uch,
as have labour'd through the tedious
<HI>Cour&s;es</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> without Succe&s;s, who&s;e
Sufferings have &s;oured the <HI>fal&s;e Plea|&s;ures</HI>
re&s;ulting from <HI>&s;en&s;ual Appetites,</HI>
and who are at length willing to
<PB REF="9">
renounce <HI>Luxury,</HI> in order to le&s;&s;en
<HI>Mi&s;ery.</HI> To the&s;e I <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> affirm, that
this <HI>Method,</HI> &s;trictly and for Time &s;uf|ficient
pur&s;ued, will afford all the <HI>Ea&s;e</HI>
which human <HI>Art</HI> can give, or human
<HI>Nature</HI> receive; and as the <HI>Time</HI> is
hourly &s;tealing on, when <HI>Art</HI> can do
no more, an Ob&s;ervance of the&s;e <HI>Rules</HI>
will be the calme&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t way of
<HI>lying down in Death.</HI></P>
<P>LET this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration then
recommend the <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI>
That it has a nece&s;&s;ary Tendency to
<HI>alleviat</HI> the <HI>Pains</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> and to &s;often
the <HI>Terrors</HI> of <HI>Death.</HI></P>

I mean as to its <HI>natural</HI> Qualities of <HI>Living,

<HI>Thinking:</HI> for as to its <HI>moral</HI> Qualities of <HI>Ju|&s;tice,
Goodne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> they may increa&s;e
or decrea&s;e to any Degree, &s;ince they intirely
depend on the <HI>Free-will:</HI> and therefore the na|tural
Faculties of <HI>Living, Perceiving</HI> and <HI>Wil|ling,</HI>
and their &s;everal Degrees and Modifica|tions
of <HI>Activity, Sagacity</HI> and <HI>De&s;ire,</HI> are <HI>e&s;|&s;entially</HI>
and uniformly permanent in it, in
their <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Degree</HI> re&s;pectively, whatever
kind of Body it animates; and when it does not
exert the&s;e <HI>innate</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> Qualities, it is be|cau&s;e
it is limited and re&s;trained by the Nature of
gro&s;s Matter, and the <HI>Laws</HI> of the Body which it
animates, which is a <HI>foreign Impediment</HI> in&s;u|perable
to its Degree of <HI>Self-activity</HI> and <HI>Self-mobility.</HI>

as to its &s;piritual Nature and Faculties, <HI>inform|ing</HI>
the Body of a <HI>Serpent,</HI> or any other orga|nis'd
Body, as informing the Body of a <HI>Man:</HI>
And an <HI>Angel</HI> animating a human Body, wou'd
be only a more perfect <HI>Man;</HI> and by its natural

perfectly exert <HI>human</HI> Functions and Operations:

And on an <HI>unorganical</HI> Body it cou'd produce
no <HI>vital</HI> Functions, it cou'd only put it into
particular Motions.</P>
<P>2. THE Body of an Animal is as perfect and
complete in its <HI>lumbaginous</HI> and <HI>&s;permatic,</HI> as
in its <HI>adult</HI> State, from the fir&s;t <HI>original Pair,</HI>
down to this pre&s;ent Time. In its <HI>lumbagi|nous</HI>
State, with re&s;pect to its Body, it is, as it
were, a mere <HI>Plant;</HI> in its <HI>&s;permatic</HI> State, it is
but a Brute <HI>Animal;</HI> and it is only and pro|perly
a <HI>Man</HI> in its <HI>adult</HI> State, when its &s;piritual
Faculties can act on its material Organs with
the lea&s;t <HI>Re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> and when its material Organs
are complete, develop'd, and cloathed with
proper Incru&s;tation and Teguments, in which
it continues but a &s;tated Time. The <HI>Skeleton,
Hulk</HI> and <HI>Rudiments</HI> of its Solids and Fluids,
with all its <HI>vital</HI> and <HI>animal Organs,</HI> are &s;imi|lar
and <HI>analogous</HI> in all the&s;e &s;everal Stages of
Being: It has the <HI>Miniature, infinite&s;imal</HI> Solids,
Fluids, and animal <HI>Organs</HI> and Functions, as
real and perfect in its <HI>lumbaginous</HI> and <HI>&s;permatic</HI>
State, as in its <HI>adult</HI> State, allowing for Cir|cum&s;tances;
for then its Solids are only <HI>infi|nitely</HI>
&s;maller, more &s;lender and delicate, <HI>roll'd</HI>
up and folded together; and its Fluids <HI>infinitely</HI>
more rare, thin and &s;ubtile; its Functions <HI>infi|nitely</HI>
weaker and &s;lower; and their Exten&s;ion,

of the <HI>Philo&s;ophers, Lawgivers,</HI> and <HI>He|roes</HI>
of Antiquity, without their Blemi&s;hes; in
a word, the <HI>fir&s;t Man</HI> mu&s;t have had exi&s;tent
in him, either <HI>actually</HI> or <HI>virtually,</HI> all the <HI>na|tural</HI>
and <HI>moral</HI> Accompli&s;hments and Endow|ments,
that ever were exi&s;tent or con&s;picuous
in any of his Po&s;terity; with due Regard to
their intended different U&s;es and Ends in God's
univer&s;al Monarchy; for the <HI>Effect</HI> can never
ri&s;e higher than the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> or the <HI>Fruit</HI> than the
<HI>Seed,</HI> or the <HI>River</HI> than its <HI>Source.</HI> I think this
mu&s;t be very plain to a true <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> and is
at the &s;ame time a <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> of the <HI>Lap&s;e</HI>
and <HI>Degeneracy</HI> of the pre&s;ent human Race.</P>
<P>4. FOR what wi&s;e Purpo&s;e the <HI>Creator</HI> of
both Body and Soul has confin'd the actuating
<HI>immaterial Sub&s;tance,</HI> for &s;o long a time, to
&s;o <HI>dark</HI> and &s;trait a <HI>Pri&s;on</HI> as is this <HI>&s;eminal
<PB N="6" REF="23">
Corpu&s;cle, viz.</HI> all the time of its Duration
from the Creation of the immaterial Spirit, and
Formation of the organis'd Body, till it arrive at
its utmo&s;t Exten&s;ion and Maturity, is not readily
conjecturable. We feel that in <HI>Sleep,</HI> the Spirit
acts but imperfectly and partially in <HI>Proportion</HI>
to its <HI>wakeing</HI> Action; in <HI>Debauches,</HI> very <HI>in|con&s;i&s;tently</HI>
and <HI>un&s;teadily;</HI> and in <HI>Syncope's</HI>
and &s;uch-like <HI>nervous Paroxy&s;ms,</HI> &s;carce at all,
and yet the <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> and real <HI>Energy</HI> or Capa|city
of the &s;piritual Sub&s;tance is equally and
uniformly the &s;ame, only the <HI>organical</HI> Ma|chine
is di&s;order'd, and will not play. We
can only therefore conclude, that po&s;&s;ibly the
<HI>&s;piritual Sub&s;tance</HI> may be &s;o long impri&s;on'd
in its <HI>Miniature, organical Corpu&s;cle,</HI> for &s;ome
moral End in the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI>
either of <HI>Purification</HI> or <HI>Puni&s;hment;</HI> perhaps
to <HI>limit</HI> and <HI>concentre</HI> the <HI>natural Powers</HI> to
a <HI>Level</HI> with the laps'd and impair'd <HI>moral</HI> ones,
that they may both ri&s;e and grow up together
equally. I mention all this but as Philo&s;ophical
Conjecture only.</P>
<P>5. ALL that the mo&s;t perfect <HI>Analy&s;is</HI> Art
can reach, is able to di&s;cover in the intimate
Compo&s;ition of Bodies, is, that they are com|pos'd,
1. Of Sulphur, Oil or Spirit, or the <HI>Mat|ter</HI>
of Fire. 2. Of <HI>Salt,</HI> or hard Particles, di&s;&s;ol|vible
by Water only. 3. <HI>Air,</HI> or a thin ela&s;tic
dry Fluid. 4. <HI>Water,</HI> or a more den&s;e, unela|&s;tic
moi&s;tening Fluid. 5. <HI>Earth,</HI> a gro&s;s unal|terable
<PB N="7" REF="24">
permanent Sub&s;tance, the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> and Ce|ment
of the other Four. From the Mixture
and Combination of the&s;e in different Quan|tities
and Proportions, all the Varieties of Bo|dies
and their Appearances may proceed.</P>
<P>6. THE great Principles of <HI>Action</HI> in Bodies,
&s;mall and great, <HI>may be,</HI> either, 1. <HI>Attraction</HI>
or <HI>Repul&s;ion,</HI> and its &s;everal Laws. 2. <HI>Ela&s;ti|city</HI>
or <HI>Reaction.</HI> 3. <HI>Fermentation.</HI> 4. <HI>Heat,
Fire,</HI> or its Matter and Cau&s;e. From what
primary Cau&s;es the&s;e proceed, I do not here
inquire; but that the&s;e are probably the <HI>&s;econ|dary</HI>
Cau&s;es of Action in all Bodies, there is
no room for doubting.</P>
<P>7. IT is then highly probable, that an ani|mal
Body <HI>divinely organis'd,</HI> and fitted with <HI>In|&s;truments</HI>
to be actuated and animated by a <HI>&s;pi|ritual
Sub&s;tance,</HI> the <HI>Moment</HI> after this &s;piri|tual
Sub&s;tance is breathed into it, or is united
to this Body, becomes a <HI>living</HI> Animal, and
not before; and then receives Nouri&s;hment,
and performs the <HI>Functions</HI> of <HI>Circulation,
Per&s;piration,</HI> and the <HI>Secretions analogically,</HI>
and by its proper Laws, in its <HI>lumbaginous</HI> and
<HI>&s;permatic</HI> Condition, as really as it does after|wards
in its <HI>adult</HI> State; and as it can have no
Nouri&s;hment in the two fir&s;t of <HI>the&s;e</HI> States,
but from a Tincture or <HI>Ze&s;t</HI> of the Juices of
the Parents, good, bad or indifferent, as they
may be, and mu&s;t fare accordingly; &s;o it will
<PB N="8" REF="25">
be <HI>nouri&s;h'd, per&s;pire, re&s;pire,</HI> and <HI>&s;ecrete</HI> in
its adult State, according to the Nature and
Qualities of what it takes in from the <HI>Juices</HI>
and <HI>Fluids</HI> about it, and next to it, whatever
they be, and however convey'd into its Habit
and Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>8. IN order to be nouri&s;h'd for &s;ome time,
and perform the <HI>animal Functions,</HI> that is,
to <HI>live,</HI> there &s;eems to be no other <HI>Condition</HI>
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, but that the <HI>Size</HI> of the
nouri&s;hing Particles be no greater than what
will ea&s;ily enter and pa&s;s from the <HI>receiving</HI>
Orifices to the <HI>excretory</HI> Orifices; or that the
nouri&s;hing Particles be no bigger than the
Mouths of the <HI>va&s;a inhalantia &amp; exhalantia;</HI>
for were they bigger, it wou'd nece&s;&s;arily creat
Ob&s;tructions, Pain, and at la&s;t <HI>Death,</HI> or the
De&s;truction of the <HI>Machin;</HI> it may be <HI>le&s;s,</HI>
$n any given Proportion; but it mu&s;t not be
<HI>greater;</HI> el&s;e it can neither readily enter, nor
prompt the animal Functions without Violence
and Pain.</P>
<P>9. TO prevent Inconveniencies that may
often happen from the <HI>finite</HI> and divi&s;ible Na|ture
of gro&s;s Matter, from <HI>infinite</HI> Accidents,
from the <HI>Un&s;uitablene&s;s</HI> of the neare&s;t Fluid,
to perform the nece&s;&s;ary Functions of living in
<HI>Animalcules</HI> for any time, we &s;ee what an <HI>In|finitude</HI>
of <HI>organis'd</HI> Particles of Matter, fitted
for living in proper Circum&s;tances, the <HI>Author</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="26">
of Nature has provided in the <HI>Seeds</HI> of <HI>Ani|mals</HI>

to bring it to <HI>Maturity.</HI> In <HI>Plants</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> the&s;e <HI>organis'd</HI> Particles are
thereby fitted to become proper Nouri&s;hment
for <HI>Animals,</HI> that there may be no real <HI>Wa&s;te</HI>

infinitely <HI>wi&s;e End</HI> or <HI>Purpo&s;e.</HI> For <HI>God and
Nature do nothing in vain;</HI> and when from
the imperfect and limited Nature of <HI>gro&s;s</HI>

they attain not the chief De&s;ign,
they <HI>chime</HI> into a <HI>Second</HI> or a <HI>Third,</HI> or &s;ome
one in the <HI>infinite Chain</HI> of Effects. And this
Con&s;ideration &s;eems to me an evident Proof of
<HI>Pre-exi&s;tence;</HI> becau&s;e every created &s;piritual
Being, or individual Spirit, mu&s;t at la&s;t find out
a proper and peculiar material gro&s;s Pri&s;on to
do Penitence in for a Time.</P>
<P>10. THE Coat or Cru&s;t &s;uper-induc'd on
the primary <HI>linear Stamina,</HI> is intended to
enable them to bear without Pain or Violence
their future States, to &s;heath, defend, and cover
their Delicacy, extreme <HI>Sen&s;ibility</HI> and <HI>Minute|ne&s;s,</HI>

and &s;olid Ob&s;tacle, they may <HI>exert</HI> their

<P>11. THE <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Contrivance</HI> of the

but each particular <HI>Fibril,</HI> each <HI>infinite&s;imal</HI> Hair
of an aetherial, or, as it were, &s;piritual Solid,

<P>12. THE &s;ame <HI>analogous</HI> Contrivance is
provided for the Covering of the internal Su|perficies
of the <HI>Bowels</HI> of Animals, (and be&s;ides
that, every original <HI>linear Solid</HI> has a Ca&s;e or
Sheath) where an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of <HI>Glands,</HI>
by the Force of the animal Functions, are con|tinually
<HI>&s;pewing</HI> out a more vi&s;cous or cra&s;&s;er
Fluid, which becomes a Slime or <HI>Mucus</HI> to
&s;heath and defend them from the internal <HI>Aura,</HI>
and their <HI>Frictions</HI> upon one another, and by
its <HI>Lubricity</HI> to keep them (the <HI>Membranes</HI>)
moi&s;t and <HI>ela&s;tic.</HI> And as this internal <HI>Aura</HI>
is more delicate and le&s;s deleterious, than the

for &s;uch a <HI>Mucus</HI> and Cuticle, to moi&s;ten

the Matter is as I have &s;tated it, both in
<HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables;</HI> only <HI>Vegetables,</HI> in

Principles of Air, Water and Earth in them;

and attenuate the Particles of Aliment to a
greater Degree of Subtilty and Minutene&s;s, and

is evaporated, the <HI>&s;aline</HI> Particles, by rea&s;on of
their greater Size and Gravity, not being able
to ri&s;e &s;o fa&s;t, and in &s;o great Quantities; and
by this <HI>Evaporation</HI> of the Water, the <HI>&s;aline</HI>
Particles are brought nearer and more crowd|ed,
and, being highly <HI>attractive,</HI> they unite
in greater <HI>Clu&s;ters;</HI> and when &s;et to cool, be|ing
lighter than Water when thus united, they
form a <HI>Film</HI> or <HI>Cuticle</HI> on its Top; and this
<HI>Film</HI> or <HI>Cuticle</HI> skim'd off, and expos'd to a
gentle Heat, to evaporate the remaining Wa|ter,

of the &s;pecific <HI>glandular Secretions</HI> of Chyle,

but e&s;pecially by the reciprocal Action
of the <HI>peri&s;taltic</HI> Motion, the finer and more
&s;ubtile Parts only of this <HI>Chyle,</HI> or <HI>Emul&s;ion,</HI>
are propell'd through the <HI>fine lacteal Searches,</HI>
and in repeated Circulations, being mix'd with

Compre&s;&s;ion of the pneumatic <HI>Mill,</HI> (by which
the integral Parts are further bruis'd) that pre|ci&s;e
Magnitude of Parts which gives them a
<HI>&s;carlet</HI> Colour, (for this is known to depend
on a certain <HI>Magnitude</HI> of <HI>&s;uperficial Par|ticles</HI>)
and are thus turned into pure <HI>arterial
Blood,</HI> to be further elabour'd in the particular
<HI>Glands</HI> for the future U&s;es of Nature.</P>

into a flat or oblong <HI>Spheroid,</HI> according to
the Nece&s;&s;ity and Figure of the <HI>Tube</HI> through
which it is to pa&s;s, and &s;o to keep the Sides of
the finer <HI>Tubes</HI> from <HI>coale&s;cing</HI> or being ob|&s;tructed.
Tho&s;e <HI>red Globules</HI> make the <HI>gru|mous</HI>
part of the Blood. And in the <HI>Serum</HI>
it&s;elf al&s;o there are many of the&s;e to be found
of a whiter Colour, which probably make the
true <HI>nutritive Globules,</HI> to &s;top Crannies, and
incra&s;&s;ate the primary <HI>Fibrils.</HI> But when the
<HI>Serum</HI> becomes gro&s;s or lixivial, the greate&s;t
part of the&s;e fine <HI>&s;carlet Globules</HI> are com|pre&s;s'd,
and bur&s;t or flatten'd, and thereby the
<HI>Grume</HI> becomes duski&s;h and black, and the
original Beauty, Colour and Magnitude, and
Shape of the&s;e <HI>Globules</HI> are chang'd. We have
an obvious Model of this Operation of Nature,
in the Globules of <HI>Oil</HI> and <HI>Vinegar,</HI> when
mix'd with a quick Motion.</P>
<P>29. As to <HI>mu&s;cular Motion,</HI> it is very
ingeniou&s;ly, and with great Probability, ac|counted
for by Dr. <HI>Bryan Robin&s;on,</HI> from
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Principles of an infi|nitely
<PB N="32" REF="49">
rare and ela&s;tic Fluid; (<HI>&s;piritus quidam</HI>)
which is the <HI>Theory</HI> of &s;ome other <HI>Mathema|ticians.</HI>
Now nothing can be more elegant,
<HI>mechanical,</HI> natural and <HI>adequate</HI> to all this
Appearance, than this Account of <HI>mu&s;cular</HI>
Motion, if this ela&s;tic Fluid could be proved.
But &s;urely the <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> of the Fibres, e&s;peci|ally
of their <HI>membranous</HI> Coats of the infi|nite&s;imal
<HI>nervous Fibrils,</HI> which they have
from the <HI>Meninges,</HI> which every one allows
to be extremely <HI>ela&s;tic,</HI> mu&s;t have the far
greater Share in all the animal Functions, and
in <HI>mu&s;cular Motion.</HI> But of this more here|after.</P>
<P>30. WHAT are the true <HI>primitive</HI> mate|rial
<HI>Organs</HI> employ'd in Thinking and <HI>Cogi|tation,</HI>
what their Nature and Figure, is ab&s;o|lutely
unknown, and, I fear, unknowable by
us. That this <HI>immaterial Principle,</HI> in its
pre&s;ent State of Union, nece&s;&s;arily requires
&s;ome <HI>organis'd</HI> In&s;truments in its <HI>intellectual</HI>

is pa&s;t all doubt. <HI>Debauches, Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> and

and <HI>Art</HI> will re&s;tore and recover them; and
to be perfectly perform'd, they require an en|tire
Sanity in the great primary <HI>Organs.</HI> That
the <HI>Nerves</HI> (which are certainly &s;lender, cel|lular
and, perhaps, unela&s;tic <HI>Filaments,</HI> at lea&s;t
in their Pith) are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>mu&s;|cular

<PB N="33" REF="50">
they require to be inflated by a <HI>Materia Subtilis,</HI>
or <HI>Liquidum Nervo&s;um;</HI> yet none doubts, that
the fir&s;t <HI>Impul&s;e</HI> proceeds from the <HI>immaterial
Sub&s;tance;</HI> and the &s;ame Impul&s;e and Energy
may be communicated directly to fitly <HI>fram'd</HI>
and duly <HI>organiz'd</HI> Filaments, at lea&s;t to their
<HI>membranous</HI> Coats, without the Intermediation
of any &s;ubtile Fluid: and whether that <HI>Fluid</HI> be
<HI>real</HI> and nece&s;&s;ary or not, can never be a&s;cer|tain'd;
in this Point all can be but probable
Conjecture only here. Some &s;ubtile Fluid may
be requir'd towards <HI>Hearing</HI> and <HI>Seeing,</HI> be|cau&s;e
nothing but the <HI>Fir&s;t Cau&s;e</HI> can act at a
Di&s;tance without a <HI>Medium;</HI> but the <HI>&s;entient
Principle</HI> has the <HI>Nerves</HI> between it and Ob|jects,
to act and be acted reciprocally on: For that
all Bodies who&s;e Particles are continuous, mu&s;t
be <HI>repellent</HI> and reactive, is nece&s;&s;ary from the
Nature of Matter; and though this <HI>&s;ubtile Fluid</HI>
may be, perhaps, convenient to account for the
Appearances of inanimated Matter, yet it &s;eems
here <HI>multiplying</HI> Cau&s;es and Qualities without
Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>31. WE find that the <HI>Brain</HI> of all <HI>Animals</HI>

and Indu&s;try, than any other <HI>Organ</HI> of the
Body. No living <HI>Animal</HI> has ever been found
without a <HI>Brain,</HI> or &s;omething analogous
to it: they have all pretty much the &s;ame
general Structure and Texture. <HI>Wounds</HI> and

put an <HI>End</HI> to living, at lea&s;t to <HI>rational Life</HI>

<HI>Organs</HI> are relax'd and debilitated, there mu&s;t
be an alternate <HI>Ce&s;&s;ation</HI> to repair and refit
them, which is call'd <HI>Sleep;</HI> and accordingly
we find the <HI>animal</HI> Body &s;horten'd and com|pre&s;s'd
by its own <HI>Weight,</HI> by Action, and by
the Lo&s;s of its <HI>Spring</HI> again&s;t Night, and length|en'd
and extended again in a Morning. What
hinders <HI>Sleep,</HI> is the continual <HI>Action</HI> of an
internal Fluid, <HI>Wind</HI> or <HI>Flatulence,</HI> acting on
the <HI>internal Membranes,</HI> (of which the Bowels
principally con&s;i&s;t) pricking and &s;timulating
them, and forcing them into <HI>Action;</HI> and by
the <HI>Recoil</HI> or <HI>ela&s;tic</HI> Sharpne&s;s of this internal
<HI>Aura</HI> or <HI>Flatus,</HI> producing wild <HI>Cogitation,</HI> or

that the Body is re&s;tle&s;s; and often there is an

<HI>Dreaming</HI> is but <HI>partial Sleeping,</HI> for <HI>Sleep</HI>

in the Nouri&s;hment of <HI>animal</HI> Bodies, and in

&s;ome degree afterwards in the capillary <HI>Arte|ries,</HI>

the &s;everal U&s;es of Nature: But &s;till, even in

<HI>animal Functions</HI> and were our Food to be
divided into &s;uch <HI>Particles,</HI> they would, from
their Smallne&s;s and con&s;equent greater degree

Method for determining the <HI>Proportion of
Nouri&s;hment,</HI> or true Matter of the Fle&s;h and
Blood, contain'd in any &s;ort of Food. He
took a <HI>Pound</HI> of Meat, that had been freed
from the <HI>Fat, Bones</HI> and <HI>Cartilages,</HI> and boil'd
it for a determin'd Time in a clo&s;e Ve&s;&s;el with
three Pints of Water; then pouring off the
Liquor, he added the &s;ame Quantity of Water,
boiling it again for the &s;ame Time; and this
Operation he repeated &s;ix &s;everal times, &s;o
that the la&s;t Liquor appear'd both in Smell,
Trial and Ta&s;te, to be little different from com|mon
Water. Then putting all the Liquor to|gether,
and filtrating, to &s;eparate the too gro&s;s
Particles, he evaporated it over a &s;low Fire, till

<HI>Organs:</HI> But after that, when come to <HI>Ma|turity,</HI>
it needs only to be <HI>equal,</HI> if we de&s;ire to
continue under the <HI>Order</HI> and De&s;ign of <HI>Na|ture.</HI></P>
<P>4. FOR the plea&s;ant and regular Perfor|mance
of the&s;e <HI>Functions,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary in
the Order of <HI>Nature,</HI> not only that the whole
<HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of <HI>Tubes</HI> be full of a warm, &s;oft, bal|&s;amic
Fluid, to maintain them in their due
<HI>Exten&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Ela&s;ticity;</HI> but that the inter|nal
and external <HI>Surfaces</HI> of the <HI>Solids</HI> be
moi&s;ten'd and lubricated, to keep them pliant
and <HI>flexible,</HI> (which &s;eems to be one great
De&s;ign of <HI>Food</HI>) and likewi&s;e to pre&s;erve them
from the Friction of the internal and external
&s;urrounding Fluids, and their Friction on one
another; and this mu&s;t be &s;ecreted from the
&s;ame <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> of Fluids in the <HI>Tubes.</HI></P>
<P>5. <HI>HUNGER</HI> is a Sen&s;e of Pain, ari&s;ing
from the partial <HI>Exinanition,</HI> or emptying of
the&s;e <HI>Tubes,</HI> by the Expences of <HI>Action</HI> or
<HI>Living,</HI> or by the continued Performance of
the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Functions;</HI> whereby the <HI>Tubes</HI>
are in &s;ome mea&s;ure emptied, and a &s;ufficient
Quantity not flowing into the <HI>Capillaries,</HI> and
the <HI>per&s;piratory</HI> and <HI>emunctory Glands,</HI> of
<PB N="60" REF="77">
which they are form'd, that <HI>balmy Film</HI> or
<HI>Cuticule</HI> which defends the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible <HI>Fi|bres,
viz.</HI> the <HI>Sides</HI> and <HI>Orifices</HI> of the <HI>&s;ecre|tory</HI>
Ve&s;&s;els, and the Sides and Coats of the
<HI>Nerves,</HI> that of the <HI>Stomach</HI> e&s;pecially, (which
is nothing but a Bag compos'd of &s;uch <HI>Nerves</HI>
and <HI>&s;ecretory Glands</HI>) is gradually worn off;
and a &s;harp, unea&s;y <HI>Sen&s;ation, Languor</HI> and
<HI>Debility,</HI> is thereby produc'd and felt over the
whole Solids of the Body, (but e&s;pecially in
the <HI>Stomach</HI>) till a &s;ufficient Quantity of this
<HI>balmy Fluid</HI> be &s;upplied again, to &s;heath and
defend the&s;e &s;en&s;ible <HI>Fibres</HI> from being &s;crap'd
and worn. But if this <HI>milky</HI> Sub&s;tance be
long and ob&s;tinately denied, the <HI>Pain</HI> becomes
&s;o intolerable, that no kind of Torture can
equal it.</P>
<P>6. FROM hence it &s;eems to me pretty
evident, that <HI>Temperance,</HI> or, if you plea&s;e,
<HI>Ab&s;tinence,</HI> (contrary to the Nature of &s;ome
other of the Virtues) &s;eldom admits but of one
<HI>Extreme, viz.</HI> the <HI>too-much,</HI> or <HI>too-high</HI> in
Food: For upon any Attempt being made up|on
the <HI>too-little,</HI> habitually and for a Conti|nuance,
the <HI>Pain</HI> becomes &s;o intolerable, that
no Per&s;on at <HI>Liberty,</HI> and in his <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> and
having proper Materials for Food in his Power,
can po&s;&s;ibly bear it: As is well known to tho&s;e
who have &s;een, or read of, the Effects of <HI>Fa|mine,</HI>
or &s;tarving in <HI>Pri&s;ons,</HI> long <HI>Sea-Voy|ages,</HI>
or <HI>De&s;arts;</HI> which is de&s;cribed by all
<PB N="61" REF="78">
to be a Torture equal to that of being burnt
alive by a <HI>&s;low Fire,</HI> or greater, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>7. IF this Repre&s;entation be ju&s;t, it will be
evident, that for <HI>Health, long Life</HI> and <HI>Sere|nity,</HI>
the &s;ure&s;t and mo&s;t effectual Mean is a
con&s;tant Endeavour and &s;teady Practice of take|ing
down the lea&s;t we can be ea&s;y under, or
are equally agile, and capable of intellectual
Exerci&s;es after, or a Trial to reach the <HI>too-little,</HI>
if po&s;&s;ible. This I take to be the
&s;horte&s;t, &s;afe&s;t, and mo&s;t effectual <HI>Rule,</HI> a wi&s;e
Man can go by. In bodily <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> it is the
<HI>one Thing nece&s;&s;ary;</HI> all other Means are but
Trifles in re&s;pect of this; and this alone is
&s;ufficient to keep a Man free from great or ha|bitual
<HI>Di&s;tempers, Lowne&s;s,</HI> and the Infirmi|ties
of <HI>Age;</HI> and to procure him a <HI>Di&s;&s;olu|tion</HI>
without violent Pain, as far as the Laws of
Mortality, and the De&s;igns of his Maker over
him, will permit; for all Men are not made
for one and the &s;ame End and Purpo&s;e, in the
De&s;igns of Providence, or <HI>God's</HI> moral Govern|ment
of his Creatures.</P>
<P>8. HENCE it will be evident, with how
little Rea&s;on the guarded, the complai&s;ant and
the cautious Dealers in <HI>Phy&s;ic, perplex, puzzle</HI>
and <HI>terrify</HI> tho&s;e, who by a low ab&s;temious
<HI>Regimen,</HI> are endeavouring to conquer their
<HI>bodily Di&s;tempers</HI> or <HI>&s;piritual Vices, viz.</HI> by
<HI>thundering</HI> over them, or <HI>&s;neering</HI> at them,
<PB N="62" REF="79">
that they are <HI>ruining</HI> their Con&s;titutions, <HI>&s;poil|ing</HI>
their Blood and Juices, <HI>creating</HI> Di&s;tem|pers,
and <HI>&s;hortening</HI> their Days, by this their
<HI>whim&s;ical, wrong-headed</HI> and unnatural <HI>Ab&s;|tinence.</HI>
But &s;urely &s;uch have little &s;tudied
Nature, and the <HI>animal Oeconomy;</HI> for it is as
impo&s;&s;ible that a <HI>free,</HI> &s;en&s;ible Per&s;on, under
<HI>Plenty,</HI> &s;hould be long able ob&s;tinately to con|tinue
under the <HI>too-little,</HI> as it would be for
him to &s;top the <HI>Sun</HI> in his Cour&s;e. If there
be In&s;tances or Records of any &s;uch, they have
been <HI>wrong-headed</HI> indeed, or <HI>lunatic,</HI> or un|der
the Influence of &s;ome unnatural <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI>
which is the &s;ame Thing: And <HI>Self-murder</HI>
may with, as much Propriety, be in&s;tanced
again&s;t the innate Principle of <HI>Self-pre&s;erva|tion,</HI>
as this is in&s;inuated again&s;t <HI>Ab&s;tinence</HI>
and Moderation in Diet; for &s;uch as I have
now mention'd is the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> and
the <HI>Exceptions</HI> mu&s;t be unnatural and <HI>mon|&s;trous.</HI>
I have often tried, for a few Days, to
approach the <HI>too-little,</HI> for the Cure of <HI>Low|ne&s;s,
Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Watchfulne&s;s;</HI> but never
could carry it above <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> Days, (when
otherwi&s;e free from a form'd <HI>Di&s;temper</HI>) after
which my <HI>Symptoms</HI> were le&s;&s;en'd, and <HI>Hun|ger</HI>
became then my greate&s;t <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>9. ONE con&s;tant <HI>Symptom</HI> of a beginning
Di&s;temper, of what Denomination &s;oever, is
at lea&s;t &s;ome Degree of <HI>Inappetence, Nau&s;ea,
Loathing</HI> or Heavine&s;s after a full Meal, or an
<PB N="63" REF="80">
Aver&s;ion to &s;trong animal Food; the Cau&s;e of
which, as far as I can conceive, is a <HI>Labour,</HI>
Struggle, or Difficulty, in the Performance of
the mention'd <HI>animal Functions;</HI> for the <HI>Cure</HI>
and Relief of which (whatever el&s;e is advis'd)
all hone&s;t and experienc'd <HI>Phy&s;icians, Ancient</HI>
or <HI>Modern,</HI> advi&s;e an appropriated low Diet or
<HI>Regimen.</HI> The <HI>Solution</HI> and <HI>Cure</HI> of all Di&s;|tempers
by Nature, when &s;olely left to her
wi&s;e Conduct, is by this <HI>Inappetence, Loath|ing,</HI>
or <HI>Ab&s;tinence,</HI> at fir&s;t; and then by &s;ome
one Evacuation or other, as <HI>Sweat, Stool,
Spitting, Coughing, Haemorrhage,</HI> or throw|ing
the <HI>morbid</HI> Matter on &s;ome di&s;tant Limb
or Joint; which always happen after an inter|mediate
<HI>Struggle</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> of the whole
<HI>animal Oeconomy,</HI> to concoct the <HI>peccant Hu|mours,</HI>
and fit them for <HI>Extermination.</HI> From
whence it will be plain, to tho&s;e who will ob|&s;erve
and imitate <HI>Nature,</HI> that &s;uch Medicines
as help Nature to concoct and fit the <HI>peccant
Humours</HI> to be readily thrown off, with a
<HI>Regimen</HI> and proper <HI>Evacuations,</HI> are the
mo&s;t material <HI>Indications</HI> in the <HI>Cure</HI> of <HI>Di&s;|tempers.</HI></P>
<P>10. <HI>MEDICINE</HI> has two Branches,
the <HI>Sanative</HI> and the <HI>Pre&s;ervative:</HI> In the
<HI>Sanative,</HI> by the <HI>Vi&s;cidity, Acrimony</HI> or <HI>in|flammatory</HI>
State of the Juices, the <HI>Inappe|tency,</HI>
and the di&s;temper'd <HI>Film</HI> or <HI>Cuticle,</HI>
that covers the internal and external Surfaces
<PB N="64" REF="81">
of the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Organs</HI> de&s;crib'd, may be
&s;uch, that <HI>Nature's</HI> Laws, of Craveing and
Hunger, may be &s;u&s;pended for a while, till &s;he
has thus prepar'd the <HI>morbid Juices</HI> for <HI>Eli|mination,</HI>
by a <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> and its <HI>Cure;</HI> and
then <HI>Medicine</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> mu&s;t direct for
her, with what Food &s;he is to be be&s;t main|tain'd
and &s;upported, till &s;he be brought to her
natural State again: and the <HI>Regimen,</HI> in &s;uch
a Ca&s;e, is allow'd by all <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> to be the
<HI>lighte&s;t</HI> and the <HI>lea&s;t, viz.</HI> of the appropri|ated
Food, for obviating and <HI>antidoting</HI> &s;uch
a particular Di&s;temper. Here then there is no
Controver&s;y, <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> being an unnatural
State of an <HI>animal</HI> Body: 'Tis therefore of the
<HI>pre&s;ervative</HI> Branch of Phy&s;ic, that what is
here maintain'd is to be under&s;tood; about
which I affirm, the mo&s;t infallible and univer|&s;al
<HI>Mean</HI> of pre&s;erving <HI>Health, lengthening
Life,</HI> and preventing Di&s;ea&s;es, is, con&s;tantly
to endeavour to take the <HI>lighte&s;t</HI> and the <HI>lea&s;t</HI>
Food (that is, Meat and Drink) a Man can be
tolerably ea&s;y under, equally agile, and fit for
intellectual Exerci&s;es after.</P>
<P>11. THE <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> may be con&s;i|der'd
in three very different Lights. There is the
<HI>Medicina Philo&s;ophica &s;eu Rationalis,</HI> where|of
true natural <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> is the Stem or Root,
and practical Medicine but a Branch. From
<HI>natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> the <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> mu&s;t learn
the Structure and U&s;es of the &s;everal <HI>Organs</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="82">
of the <HI>animal</HI> Body, and the Laws of the <HI>ani|mal
Oeconomy;</HI> and from the <HI>Symptoms</HI> and
Appearances on that Foundation, draw out his
<HI>Intentions</HI> in any given Ca&s;e or Di&s;ea&s;e. From
the &s;ame <HI>natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> he mu&s;t make
him&s;elf acquainted with the <HI>Nature, U&s;es</HI> and
<HI>Virtues</HI> of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> or the Mate|rials
commonly u&s;ed in <HI>Medicine,</HI> and to the
<HI>fir&s;t</HI> adju&s;t this <HI>la&s;t,</HI> in order to <HI>antidote</HI> the
Cau&s;es of a given Di&s;temper; and he who is
the be&s;t <HI>natural Philo&s;opher</HI> will, <HI>caeteris pa|ribus,</HI>
ever be the be&s;t <HI>Phy&s;ician. Pharmacy</HI>
is of a lower Order, and like <HI>Cookery</HI> in Diet.
Then there is the <HI>Medicina Expectativa,</HI>
which con&s;i&s;ts in keeping up the <HI>Patient's</HI>
Hopes, Expectations and Spirits, till Nature
points out clearly the principal Cau&s;es and
great <HI>Symptoms</HI> in <HI>acute</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es; and in <HI>chro|nical</HI>
Ca&s;es, till <HI>Air, Exerci&s;e</HI> and <HI>Regimen</HI>
have taken Place. And this Branch of <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI>
in <HI>low</HI> and <HI>nervous</HI> Ca&s;es, and weak and <HI>wrong-headed</HI>
Patients, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to keep
them from Uncon&s;tancy and changing Hands;
and &s;o, at lea&s;t, is a nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Art</HI> for a Phy|&s;ician,
towards tho&s;e Patients who cannot di|&s;tingui&s;h
between <HI>Surfaces</HI> and <HI>Solids.</HI> Many
a gro&s;s Glutton has been cured by a Ring of
Changes of <HI>Coral, Crabs-Eyes</HI> and <HI>Pearl,</HI> with
<HI>A&s;&s;es Milk,</HI> to damp his <HI>voracious</HI> Appetite,
who could not have borne the word <HI>Ab&s;ti|nence.</HI>
And, la&s;tly, there is the <HI>Medicina ad
Euthana&s;iam,</HI> which, when the Ca&s;e is plainly
<PB N="66" REF="83">
and ab&s;olutely <HI>Mortal,</HI> lays the Patient down
in Death with the lea&s;t Pain. But as this is
&s;eldom a certain Ca&s;e, in <HI>chronical</HI> Illne&s;&s;es at
lea&s;t, except in very tedious Di&s;ea&s;es, and Pa|tients
worn out by <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> it
ought to be practi&s;ed only like <HI>Extreme Un|ction.</HI>
The&s;e two la&s;t kinds of Knowledge in
Phy&s;ic, though &s;oon learn'd, as being readily
to be met with in every good Book of <HI>Phar|macy</HI>
or <HI>Medicine,</HI> yet could never &s;trike my
<HI>Fancy;</HI> I always &s;ought after a &s;olid and dura|ble
<HI>Cure</HI> of Di&s;tempers; and was for &s;triking
at the <HI>Root</HI> of the Weed, leaving the picking
of the <HI>Suckers</HI> and <HI>Leaves</HI> to others; though
in <HI>acute</HI> Ca&s;es, that often turn on &s;mall Things,
all Oars are to be plied, and every Art &s;tudied,
and even the mo&s;t trifling Mean, conducive
to the End, attended with Diligence.</P>
<P>12. I HAVE a due E&s;teem for the <HI>Philo|&s;ophers</HI>
and <HI>wi&s;e Men</HI> both of <HI>Antiquity</HI> and
<HI>later</HI> Ages; tho&s;e who have labour'd to cure
the Di&s;ea&s;es of the <HI>Mind,</HI> and tho&s;e who have
&s;ugge&s;ted effectual <HI>Means</HI> for the <HI>Cure</HI> or <HI>Re|lief</HI>
of the Di&s;tempers of the Body; as well as for
tho&s;e who have di&s;cover'd the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and
<HI>Beauty</HI> of the <HI>Works</HI> of the <HI>Author of Na|ture.</HI>
The <HI>Chri&s;tian Philo&s;ophy,</HI> repre&s;ented
in its true Light, is infinitely beyond any thing
that ever was thought of, or could po&s;&s;ibly
enter into the Heart of Creatures to imagine,
for extirpating the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Mind,</HI> as
<PB N="67" REF="84">
is allow'd even by its <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> them&s;elves:
For remedying the Di&s;tempers of the <HI>Body,</HI> to
make a Man live as long as his original <HI>Frame</HI>
was de&s;ign'd to la&s;t, with the lea&s;t <HI>Pain,</HI> few|e&s;t
<HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> or Lo&s;s of his Sen&s;es, I think
<HI>Pythagoras</HI> and <HI>Cornaro</HI> (for &s;ugge&s;ting a ge|neral
and effectual <HI>Mean</HI>) by far the two
greate&s;t Men that ever were; the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> by <HI>ve|getable</HI>
Food, and <HI>unfermented</HI> Liquors; the
<HI>latter,</HI> by the <HI>lighte&s;t</HI> and the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> of <HI>animal
Food,</HI> and naturally fermented Liquors. Both
lived to a great <HI>Age:</HI> But what is chiefly to be
regarded in their Conduct and Example, both pre|&s;erv'd
their <HI>Sen&s;es, Chearfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Serenity,</HI> to
the la&s;t; and, which is &s;till more to be regarded,
both, at lea&s;t the la&s;t, <HI>di&s;&s;olv'd</HI> without Pain
or Struggle; the fir&s;t having lo&s;t his Life in a
Tumult, as is &s;aid by &s;ome, after a great Age
of perfect Health.</P>
<P>13. THE <HI>lowe&s;t Diet,</HI> or one of a <HI>Milk,
Seeds</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> &s;eems only nece&s;&s;ary
and appropriated to tho&s;e, who by their <HI>own,</HI>
or by the <HI>Fault</HI> of their <HI>Parents,</HI> have ex|tremely
vicious Juices, either <HI>too hot, too &s;alt</HI>
or <HI>too vi&s;cous,</HI> and are con&s;equently &s;ubject to
the nece&s;&s;ary Effects and Di&s;ea&s;es of &s;o <HI>di&s;tem|per'd</HI>
Fluids, which <HI>Milk,</HI> (being white Blood)
<HI>Seeds</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> are more &s;pecifically
qualified to <HI>antidote</HI> (for it is the Juices only
&s;uch a Diet alters or mends). There is another
<HI>Order</HI> of human Bodies, for which this <HI>Regi|men</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="85">
&s;eems al&s;o particularly proper, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e
who have <HI>&s;harp</HI> and <HI>large</HI> Appetite, or great
and over-&s;tretch'd <HI>Stomachs</HI> by their <HI>Frame,</HI>
or by former <HI>Luxury, Intemperance</HI> and <HI>Lazi|ne&s;s;</HI>
and con&s;equently <HI>lax</HI> and weak <HI>Solids</HI>
and <HI>Organs</HI> of <HI>Dige&s;tion</HI> are utterly incapable
to concoct, grind and perfectly dige&s;t any Quan|tity
of animal Food, or bear <HI>&s;pirituous</HI> Liquors;
this <HI>Diet</HI> to &s;uch is not unlike the Method
commonly u&s;ed by <HI>Jockies</HI> to cure their
<HI>Hor&s;es,</HI> when their <HI>Corn</HI> pa&s;&s;es through them
undige&s;ted and entire, which is to mix it with
<HI>Straw.</HI> For other Per&s;ons tolerably well and
&s;ound, the lighte&s;t and the lea&s;t of common
Diet, is the more <HI>univer&s;al</HI> and &s;afe&s;t Regimen,
as Experience &s;hews by its being common; for
<HI>God</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> do nothing in vain.</P>
<P>14. ONE great Advantage a <HI>vegetable</HI> Diet
has over an <HI>animal</HI> one, is, that in the weake&s;t
<HI>Dige&s;tions,</HI> and the mo&s;t dangerous and ob|&s;tinate
Di&s;tempers, the <HI>Patient</HI> may always
fill his Belly, and &s;atisfy his <HI>Hunger,</HI> without
Fear, Remor&s;e or Suffering; at <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> he may
do it to a great Degree, till he comes to be far
advanced in Years: and if he &s;hould happen at
any time to exceed, he feels none of tho&s;e
<HI>pungent</HI> and <HI>acute Symptoms,</HI> nor tho&s;e dura|ble
Effects and profound <HI>Sinkings,</HI> he would
feel from a full Meal of <HI>high</HI> Meats and <HI>&s;trong</HI>
Drinks. And this is no &s;mall Comfort to tho&s;e
who are under a dangerous Di&s;temper, or have
<PB N="69" REF="86">
a great Degree of <HI>Sen&s;ibility.</HI> The common
and nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Calls</HI> for Food returning &s;o often,
it would be a painful and intolerable Con|&s;traint
to be confin'd to an everla&s;ting Guard
and <HI>Attention,</HI> and to eat and drink by Weight
and Mea&s;ure; to live thus <HI>medic&egrave;</HI> is to live
<HI>mi&s;er&egrave;</HI> indeed. But a <HI>vegetable</HI> Diet, in a
great mea&s;ure, frees the Patient from all tho&s;e
continually recurring <HI>Snares,</HI> Dreads, and con|&s;equent
Sufferings; for not only the <HI>Tempta|tion</HI>
to <HI>Exce&s;s</HI> is much le&s;s, but the Effects of
<HI>Exce&s;s</HI> are little or none in Compari&s;on of
tho&s;e of high <HI>animal</HI> Food and <HI>rich Wine.</HI>
Add to this, that the <HI>Secretions,</HI> and other <HI>ani|mal
Functions,</HI> are more regular and freely per|formed,
under a full Diet of <HI>vegetable</HI> Food,
than they can po&s;&s;ibly be under that very &s;pare
and &s;mall Quantity of <HI>animal Food,</HI> and fer|mented
Liquors, that is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
be ob&s;erved in a great many <HI>Ca&s;es,</HI> as mo&s;t
<HI>Patients</HI> and all <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> know; and thus
being able to take down a much greater (for
In&s;tance, a quadruple) Quantity of <HI>vegetable</HI>
Food, than would be fit for them to take of
<HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors, the now
over-&s;tretch'd and relax'd Bowels and Ve&s;&s;els
may be kept fuller, the <HI>Secretions</HI> will be more
plentiful, and all the <HI>Capillaries</HI> pervious and
fill'd; which under the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>&s;pare Diet</HI>
of very little <HI>animal</HI> Food and <HI>fermented</HI> Li|quors,
might, for want of proper Liquor, dry
up and <HI>coale&s;ce;</HI> and &s;o the Animal be de|priv'd
<PB N="70" REF="87">
of many <HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Arteriolae,</HI> in which
all the Delicacy of Life con&s;i&s;ts; be&s;ides that

<P>15. A PLAIN, natural, and <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI>
Rea&s;on, why <HI>vegetable</HI> Food is preferable to
all other Food, is, that abounding with few or
no <HI>Salts,</HI> being <HI>&s;oft</HI> and <HI>cool,</HI> and con&s;i&s;ting
of Parts that are ea&s;ily divided and form'd into
<HI>Chyle,</HI> without giving any <HI>Labour</HI> to the <HI>di|ge&s;tive</HI>
Powers, it has not that Force to open
the Mouths of the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> (if they really have
any opening into the Inte&s;tines, which <HI>Leuwen|hoeck</HI>
and all accurate <HI>Anatomi&s;ts</HI> deny) to di&s;|tend
their <HI>Orifices,</HI> and excite them to an unna|tural
Activity, to let pa&s;s too great a Quantity of
<HI>hot</HI> and <HI>rank Chyle</HI> into the Blood, and &s;o over|charge
and inflame the <HI>Lymphatics</HI> and <HI>Capilla|ries,</HI>
which is the natural and ordinary Effect of
<HI>animal</HI> Food, and therefore cannot &s;o readily
produce Di&s;ea&s;es. There is not a &s;ufficient
<HI>Stimulus</HI> in the <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>vegetable</HI>
Food, to create an unnatural <HI>Appetite,</HI> or vio|lent
<HI>Cramming,</HI> at lea&s;t not &s;ufficient to force
open and extend the Mouths of the <HI>Lacteals,</HI>
more than naturally they are or ought to be.
Such Food requires little or no Force of <HI>Di|ge&s;tion,</HI>
a little gentle <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Motion</HI> being
&s;ufficient to di&s;&s;olve it into its integral Particles,
and into a thin watery <HI>Emul&s;ion,</HI> &s;uch as is
<HI>Chicken Water, A&s;&s;es Milk,</HI> or <HI>thin Broth,</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="88">
which is all that is required for the Purpo&s;e of
<HI>Nutrition,</HI> and all of the Food that can enter
the <HI>Lacteals:</HI> So that in a vegetable Diet, tho'
the &s;harp Humours in the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> an ex|tended
<HI>relax'd Stomach,</HI> and &s;ometimes a de|lightful
<HI>Piquancy</HI> in the Food, may tempt one
to exceed in <HI>Quantity;</HI> yet rarely, if <HI>Spices</HI>
and <HI>Sauces</HI> (as too much <HI>Butter, Oil, Salt</HI> and
<HI>Sugar</HI>) are not join'd to <HI>Seeds</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
can the Mi&s;chief go further than the <HI>Primae
Viae,</HI> or <HI>Stomach</HI> and Bowels, to create a pre|&s;ent
Load, Sickne&s;s, Vomiting or Purging, by
its acquiring an <HI>Acrimony,</HI> from its not being
receiv'd into the <HI>Lacteals;</HI> &s;o that no more
being admitted into the Blood, than the Ex|pences
of <HI>living</HI> require, <HI>Life</HI> and Health can
never be endanger'd on a <HI>vegetable Diet.</HI>

though I will not ab&s;olutely determin

will fix and habituat the&s;e two Di&s;tempers into
their habitual Natures. All Di&s;tempers are
cured by their Contraries; low living and Wa|ter-drinking,
will not only prevent, but cure
the&s;e two kinds of Di&s;tempers. Exce&s;&s;es in
this low, cool living, as to the Quantity taken
down, can only produce a little tran&s;ient Sick|ne&s;s,
and Evacuation upwards or downwards;
and he who would pre&s;erve his Head clear,
his Faculties quick, and his Attention fix'd,
need only live as <HI>low</HI> and <HI>cool</HI> as he finds
his Nature can bear with tolerable Ea&s;e, and

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Reflections on the Nature, Cau&s;e and Theory

<P>1. UPON all the <HI>Experience</HI> I have ever
had, or the <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> I could
ever read or make, I have concluded a <HI>Fever,</HI>
or an acute Di&s;temper, (genuine or &s;ymptoma|tical)
is to be denominated <HI>&s;o,</HI> or to be called
<HI>&s;uch,</HI> chiefly from an uncommon, dureable
<HI>Quickne&s;s, Fullne&s;s, Hardne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>Labour,</HI> in
the Pul&s;e, and a Foulne&s;s of the Mouth or
Tongue; and that the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> proceeded from too
great a Quantity, <HI>Den&s;ity</HI> or <HI>Tenacity</HI> of the
<HI>Blood Globules;</HI> and the <HI>&s;econd</HI> from too hot,
acrid and <HI>briny</HI> a State of the <HI>Serum;</HI> and that
both together made that State of the <HI>Blood</HI>
which produc'd <HI>malignant,</HI> putrid and <HI>caco|chymic</HI>
Fevers, of which there are endle&s;s, u&s;e|le&s;s
and frivolous Di&s;tinctions among <HI>Authors,</HI>
which can neither be a&s;certain'd, when they
happen, nor afford ju&s;t and di&s;tinct <HI>Indications</HI>
to pro&s;ecute a proper <HI>Cure:</HI> The&s;e two menti|oned
<HI>Di&s;tinctions</HI> admit all the Degrees of finite
Quantities, hold thro' all their various Kinds,
(who&s;e <HI>Symptoms</HI> &s;eem to me rather <HI>Effects</HI>
than <HI>Cau&s;es</HI>) and will account for all the Ap|pearances
of <HI>acute</HI> Di&s;tempers. As to <HI>&s;low,</HI>

the <HI>Indications</HI> for the Cure of the &s;everal
kinds of <HI>Fevers</HI> will ri&s;e very naturally and
readily; <HI>viz.</HI> in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> kinds of <HI>Fevers;</HI>
1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Evacuations of all proper kinds, e&s;peci|ally
<HI>Phlebotomy,</HI> till at lea&s;t the Strength
and Velocity of the <HI>Pul&s;e</HI> &s;ub&s;ide, and, 2<HI>dly,</HI>
cooling, acid and thin <HI>Dilution</HI> plentifully
and uniformly thrown in, to &s;eparate the
<HI>Blood-Globules,</HI> and keep all the <HI>Capillaries</HI>
pervious, and prevent their Ob&s;truction and
<HI>Coale&s;cence.</HI> In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> kind of Fevers,
le&s;s, though &s;ufficient, <HI>Evacuation,</HI> but more
plentiful <HI>Dilution,</HI> of the <HI>mucilaginous</HI> kind,
to &s;heath the acrid <HI>Salts</HI> of the <HI>Serum,</HI> and
then the <HI>Te&s;tacea,</HI> with the mild <HI>pondero&s;e</HI>
(<HI>Cinnabar,</HI> native or artificial, and <HI>Antimony
Diaphoretic, Bezoarticum Minerale, &amp;c.</HI>) to
break their Points, are here indicated; and in
the <HI>compounded</HI> kinds, a <HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> of both
<PB N="98" REF="115">
<HI>Intentions,</HI> and both kinds of Medicines; in
the <HI>Symptomatic</HI> Kind, be&s;ides the general
<HI>Intention,</HI> a particular Application and <HI>topical</HI>
Remedies to the les'd <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> or <HI>Organ.</HI> Per|haps
&s;imple and clear <HI>Orange-Tea</HI> or Whey
thrown in perpetually, and the cooling <HI>Salts,</HI>
with the &s;imple <HI>Te&s;tacea,</HI> even in the blood|globular

Lemons, and the mild <HI>pondero&s;e</HI> with the
<HI>Te&s;tacea,</HI> may do well in the <HI>&s;erous</HI> Kind, if
con&s;tantly, regularly and plentifully thrown

in my way of Thinking, from the
Nature of their wor&s;t and mo&s;t deleterious
Kind, under which I would cla&s;s all the
<HI>eruptive</HI> Kinds, as le&s;&s;er Degrees of the &s;ame

<P>3. <HI>CONTAGION,</HI> its Nature and
Cau&s;e, have much puzzled and perplex'd &s;ome
<HI>Philo&s;ophers;</HI> and yet, if we take the Mat|ter
right, there will no &s;uch Difficulty be found
in it, as is commonly imagin'd. For &s;up|po&s;ing,
1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That all Matter is <HI>attractive,</HI>
both in its &s;mall and great Parts: 2<HI>dly,</HI> That
this <HI>Attraction</HI> is according to &s;ome con&s;tant
and invariable <HI>Law,</HI> as the <HI>&s;ubduplicate, &s;ub|triplicate,</HI>
or &s;ome other <HI>reciprocal</HI> Propor|tion
of the Di&s;tance from the Centre of the
Particles: 3<HI>dly,</HI> That the le&s;s a Body is, the
greater will be its Degree of <HI>Attraction</HI> in
<PB N="99" REF="116">
re&s;pect of its Solidity, or the Quantity of
Matter it contains: 4<HI>thly,</HI> That <HI>Fire, Heat,
Fermentation,</HI> and all kinds of <HI>inte&s;tine</HI> Mo|tion,
have a natural Tendency and <HI>Energy</HI>
only to divide and re&s;olve Bodies into their
&s;malle&s;t Parts; and con&s;equently that <HI>chy|mical</HI>
Fires, and all artificial Operations, by
which the Particles of Bodies are violently
agitated, can have no other Effect than to
divide them into le&s;&s;er, and &s;till le&s;&s;er Parts;
which Parts, when once &s;eparated and &s;et free,
either recede and fly off from one another, if
without the <HI>Sphere</HI> of each other's <HI>Attraction;</HI>
or <HI>coale&s;ce,</HI> and run into one another's Em|braces,
and &s;o form Bodies of a different <HI>Tex|ture</HI>
and <HI>Bulk.</HI> Thus, for Example, the
Juice of the <HI>Grape,</HI> when duly fermented,
turns <HI>vinous,</HI> that is, by the inte&s;tine Motion
and Heat, ari&s;ing from the Laws of <HI>Gravity</HI>
and <HI>Attraction,</HI> the <HI>Tartar</HI> and e&s;&s;ential <HI>Salt</HI>
runs together, and &s;ticks to the Sides of the
Ve&s;&s;el, the Husks &s;wim on the Top, and the
Stones and earthy Parts drop to the Bottom,
and form the <HI>Lees,</HI> and the <HI>vinous</HI> Part &s;wims
in the Middle, according to its Purity, or rela|tive
Levity. A <HI>&s;econd Fermentation</HI> on the
&s;ame Body by the &s;ame Laws and <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI>
renders that <HI>acetous</HI> which was before <HI>vinous;</HI>
the <HI>&s;ulphurous</HI> or inflammable <HI>Spirit</HI> evapo|rating,
and the <HI>e&s;&s;ential Salts</HI> remaining di&s;|&s;olving
and mixing with the Lymph, makes
it <HI>acetous:</HI> The&s;e divided by a &s;till greater and
<PB N="100" REF="117">
more violent Heat, as in an <HI>Alembic,</HI> &s;eparats
the Parts more minutely, and minutely throw|ing
off the lighte&s;t fir&s;t, and the others in Pro|portion
to their <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Volatility;</HI> and
when artificially treated, afford the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the
<HI>Oil,</HI> and the <HI>Salt,</HI> apart. 5<HI>thly,</HI> There are
properly but three kinds of <HI>Salts,</HI> though
never any of them is to be obtained pure, <HI>viz.</HI>
the <HI>Acid,</HI> the <HI>Alkali,</HI> and the Urinous or Vola|til
<HI>Salt.</HI> The <HI>Acid</HI> &s;eems to be angular, with
<HI>plain</HI> Surfaces; hence its Sharpne&s;s, and greater
<HI>Attraction.</HI> The <HI>Alkali</HI> &s;eems to be porous
and obtu&s;e, or <HI>calcarious,</HI> as hard <HI>Sponges;</HI>
and hence its <HI>Fermentation</HI> with Acids. The
<HI>third</HI> &s;eems to be porous and obtu&s;e, but inti|mately
united with a light volatil <HI>Oil</HI> or <HI>Sul|phur;</HI>
and hence its <HI>Volatility</HI> and <HI>Detona|tion.</HI>
And the&s;e are the <HI>Salts</HI> that all <HI>animal</HI>
Sub&s;tances, and mo&s;t <HI>Vegetables</HI> yield, when
<HI>chymically</HI> prepar'd, or much divided and &s;ub|lim'd
by <HI>Putrefaction, Fermentation,</HI> or <HI>Di|&s;tillation.</HI>
6<HI>thly,</HI> The&s;e <HI>Salts</HI> are divi&s;ible or
<HI>&s;ubtili&s;ible in infinitum,</HI> and are mix'd with
one another in all Proportions, and with more
or le&s;s <HI>Sulphur, Oil,</HI> or inflammable <HI>Spirit,</HI>
which renders them capable of infinit <HI>Vola|tility</HI>
and <HI>Sublimity,</HI> and &s;o of <HI>infinit</HI> Force
or Activity; and it is to the&s;e that Contagion

<P>7. ALL <HI>epideimcal,</HI> infectious and erup|tive
Di&s;tempers, are but le&s;&s;er Degrees of <HI>pe&s;ti|lential</HI>
ones, cau&s;ed by the&s;e <HI>animal Salts</HI>
weaken'd and diluted. The <HI>Itch</HI> ari&s;es from
the &s;ame <HI>animal</HI> Salts, of a more cour&s;e, dull
and le&s;s deleterious Nature, encourag'd by
Na&s;tine&s;s, as <HI>Vermin</HI> are bred in clo&s;e damp
Rooms. The <HI>Small-pox</HI> is the fir&s;t Elements,
or the lowe&s;t Degree of the <HI>Plague</HI> and <HI>Pe|&s;tilence;</HI>
and the <HI>Great-pox</HI> is the &s;ame, more
condens'd and concentred: And thus, by an
ea&s;y and natural Piece of <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> all <HI>epi|demical</HI>
Infections, and <HI>pe&s;tilential</HI> Di&s;tempers,
may be accounted for.</P>
<P>8. <HI>ACUTE</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es are generally pro|duc'd
more immediately by Exce&s;&s;es in &s;trong,
fermented, or <HI>&s;pirituous</HI> Liquors. <HI>Spirits</HI> and
<HI>volatil</HI> Oils have the mo&s;t &s;udden, the mo&s;t
active and deleterious Quality. <HI>Gluttony</HI> may
create Ob&s;tructions in the <HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Capil|laries,</HI>
and &s;o produce <HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es;
but it is by <HI>Drunkenne&s;s</HI> alone, and dealing
too freely with Fire and <HI>Spirits,</HI> that quick
<PB N="105" REF="122">
and violent Deva&s;tations are made. I am
never under any Apprehen&s;ion for tho&s;e who
drink nothing but Water, (the only Beverage
fitted and perfected by the <HI>Author of Nature</HI>
for <HI>animal</HI> Bodies) let their Complaints and
Di&s;ea&s;es be called by what&s;oever Name they
will; there is no po&s;&s;ible Ca&s;e in an <HI>animal</HI>

endeavouring to throw the peccant Humours
on the farthe&s;t Di&s;tance from the <HI>Centre</HI> and
<HI>Bowels,</HI> and on the Extremities, that Water-drinking
is not &s;afe and proper; and in Per|&s;ons

internal Springs of the Circulation, and help
them to propel the morbid Matter to the

when there is an <HI>Anxietas Praecordiorum,</HI> an
internal Di&s;order on the <HI>Springs</HI> and motive
Powers, a Sickne&s;s, <HI>Nau&s;ea</HI> and <HI>Retching,</HI>
and even then only, when the Di&s;ea&s;e is too

<P>11. I HAVE often wonder'd how the an|tient

the Time of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, and
with &s;uch wonderful <HI>Eulogies,</HI> from all <HI>An|tiquity,</HI>
cured their <HI>Patients,</HI> when it is cer|tain
the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> was then very nar|row
and &s;imple, and tho&s;e Medicines men|tioned
<PB N="109" REF="126">
and de&s;cribed by them were of the
roughe&s;t and mo&s;t active Kind, &s;uch as <HI>Helle|bor,
Coloquintida, Elaterium,</HI> and the like, and
their Number very &s;mall. All I can imagine
to account for this, is, that <HI>Diet,</HI> or rather
ab&s;olute <HI>Fa&s;ting,</HI> (as was certainly the Prac|tice
of <HI>A&s;clepiades</HI>) much <HI>Dilution,</HI> and e&s;pe|cially
plentiful Water-drinking in acute Ca&s;es,
was their great Affair: but their <HI>Climat</HI> and

Method tho' has lately been renewed with unac|countable
and almo&s;t miraculous Succe&s;s in
<HI>Snow</HI> or <HI>Ice-water</HI> at <HI>Naples,</HI> as may be &s;een
by the Account of it in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical

(<HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> and others) of the wonderful Ef|fects
of it in almo&s;t all Ca&s;es with a quick
Pul&s;e; in &s;ome particularly, by pouring down
every Hour, or every half Hour, a Pint or half
a Pint of this Water, cold or hot, according
to the Sea&s;on, and &s;ometimes acuated, when
&s;luggi&s;h, with <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Nitre</HI> or Currant|jelly;
and continued even to 35 Days, with|out

&s;ame Nature, (with a quick Pul&s;e) and &s;ome
<HI>Chronical</HI> ones, have been &s;ent me well at|te&s;ted;

<HI>Model</HI> and <HI>Specimen:</HI> I cannot think,
indeed, this Method imitable in our colder
<HI>Climat;</HI> but this I am very certain of, that if
the <HI>animal</HI> Body be nothing but a <HI>Compages</HI>
or Fabric of <HI>Pipes,</HI> as it mo&s;t certainly is, then
plentiful <HI>Dilution,</HI> by injecting the thinne&s;t,
mo&s;t fluid, and moi&s;tening of all <HI>Liquids,</HI> is
the readie&s;t way to clean&s;e and make them
<HI>pervious;</HI> and the only thing that can pre|&s;erve
them open, if they are not clogg'd and
ob&s;tructed with too gro&s;s and improper Food
in the Time; for in <HI>Acute Ca&s;es,</HI> there is little
or no Dige&s;tion, and there mo&s;t certainly is
a mo&s;t univer&s;al <HI>Ob&s;truction</HI> of all the <HI>Glands</HI>
or <HI>Capillaries:</HI> For let <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> di&s;pute to
the End of the World, about the Cau&s;e of
<HI>Fevers,</HI> I think there can be but the&s;e <HI>two,</HI>
an acrid, hot and <HI>vi&s;cid</HI> Blood and Juices, and
an univer&s;al <HI>Ob&s;truction</HI> of the <HI>Lymphatics,

happen to fall on particular <HI>Organs</HI> or Bowels;

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. 1. THE <HI>Blood</HI> is the Source and oc|ca&s;ional
Cau&s;e of <HI>Animal Life:</HI>
In the <HI>Blood is the Life thereof,</HI> &s;ay <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI>
and, I think, &s;o &s;ays the be&s;t <HI>natural Philo|&s;ophy;</HI>
and according as it is good, bad, or
indifferent, &s;o is the Health of the <HI>Animal.</HI>
When I find the <HI>Blood</HI> like <HI>Lambs Blood,</HI>
that is, when the <HI>Serum</HI> is about One-half,
or One-fourth, of the Whole, near limpid, or
of a pale <HI>yellow</HI> Colour, not over <HI>&s;alti&s;h,</HI> nor
too &s;weet, the <HI>Curd</HI> florid, without <HI>Size</HI> or
<HI>Buff</HI> on the Top, and readily yielding to the
Knife, or dividing <HI>In&s;trument;</HI> I conclude my
Patient in no immediate Danger, let his
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> or his Di&s;temper, be called how it
will; not but that &s;uch a Per&s;on may have
&s;ometimes grievous Ails, to wit, from topical
Injuries, a loaded or relaxed Stomach, or
<PB N="112" REF="129">
Solids, ob&s;tructed <HI>me&s;eraic Glands,</HI> or from
the Blood and Juices not being as yet per|fectly
&s;weeten'd and thinn'd in the <HI>capillary</HI>
Ve&s;&s;els (but there forming Ob&s;tructions); from
preternatural Formations, or <HI>epidemical</HI> and
accidental Injuries: But while the Ca&s;e is as I
have ju&s;t now de&s;cribed it, I am confident the
Patient is under no pre&s;ent mortal Di&s;temper,
and in Time, by proper Means, may get over
the&s;e <HI>Symptoms,</HI> and well again, if he is not
too far gone in Life.</P>
<P>&sect;. 2. THE Blood appears by the <HI>Micro&s;cope,</HI>
like Water with mix'd &s;oft Fle&s;h <HI>Globules,</HI> which
by Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI>'s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</NOTE> accurate Experiments, are
about Three-fourths of the Weight of the whole
Ma&s;s, and in <HI>Diameter</HI> about 1/124 of the <HI>Dia|meter</HI>
of an ordinary Hair of the Head. By
a <HI>Chymical Analy&s;is,</HI> he found a great Propor|tion
of <HI>Phlegm</HI> or pure Water in the <HI>Serum,</HI>
and but little <HI>Salt, Oil</HI> and <HI>Earth;</HI> but that the
<HI>Curd</HI> had much le&s;s <HI>Phlegm,</HI> and a great deal
more of the&s;e others: But I have little Faith
in the Principles of any natural Bodies forced
out by the <HI>Tortures</HI> of Fire in <HI>Chymi&s;try,</HI> at
lea&s;t for the Purpo&s;e of Medicine, that <HI>Ana|ly&s;is</HI>
quite altering the Texture, Figure and
Properties of the integral Particles of natural
Bodies; nor have I ever, in my Practice and
Ob&s;ervation, found a <HI>Chymical</HI> Medicine of
<PB N="113" REF="130">
any Value or Efficacy in the Cure of <HI>Chro|nical</HI>
Di&s;tempers, which I could not &s;upply
better by <HI>unanalys'd</HI> natural Bodies, and their
integral Particles, in Water, prepared only by
common <HI>Cookery;</HI> be&s;ides the Damage the&s;e
Chymical Medicines, when introduced into
the Habit, do, in the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, if con|tinued
long, or given in any great Quantity.</P>
<P>&sect;. 3. THE <HI>Foulne&s;s, Acrimony</HI> and <HI>Size</HI> of
the Blood, I take chiefly to ari&s;e from &s;trong
fermented Liquors, in which the Oil, Spirit, and
Salt, is &s;et free by Dige&s;tion, and then &s;uper|abounds.
Nature has created for us animal
and vegetable Foods, but no fermented Li|quors:
they are the Product of <HI>infernal</HI> Art.
I have by frequent little <HI>Phlebotomies,</HI> aqueous
Beverage, a low Diet, and the mild <HI>Pon|dero&s;e,</HI>
ob&s;erved the <HI>Buff</HI> on the Blood grow
thinner, its Colour livelier and whiter, the
<HI>Serum</HI> more tran&s;parent and &s;weeter, and the
<HI>Symptoms</HI> of the Di&s;temper milder and le&s;s
frequent, by &s;en&s;ible Degrees; and no doubt
they all come on in the &s;ame Order and De|grees,
by the quite contrary Methods to which
they go off. Strong <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors con|tract
and bind together the <HI>Blood-Glo|bules,</HI>
and &s;tuff them with their <HI>Oils</HI> and
<HI>Spirits,</HI> &s;o that they become lighter, and
&s;wim on the Top of the &s;eparating Ma&s;s, fill
the <HI>Serum</HI> with their Salts, and weaken and
break the Cohe&s;ion and Ela&s;ticity of the <HI>So|lids,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="131">
by their too &s;trong <HI>Stimulus,</HI> &s;o that they
are not &s;ufficient to circulate and mix in due
Proportion the &s;everal Principles, and continue
the Ma&s;s of Blood, &s;o as it ought to be, in a
&s;ound State of Health; and hence Ob&s;tructions,
Di&s;tempers, and Death.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. THE whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI>
in Chronical Di&s;tempers at lea&s;t, is to render
the Blood (and con&s;equently all the other
<HI>Secretions</HI> &s;eparated from it) &s;ufficiently fluid,
&s;weet and bal&s;amic; this alone can re&s;tore to
the Patient perfect and dureable Health, and
nothing le&s;s ever can. Many a Per&s;on is born
with this bad Blood from di&s;ea&s;ed Parents,
and in &s;ome I have &s;een it &s;en&s;ibly, (without
catching Cold, as is the common Cant,) even
when very young, to my great Surprize; but
always found the Parents had been unhealthy,
when they were born, or had died early of
&s;ome <HI>Chronical</HI> Di&s;temper, or the Children
were begot when the Parents were old, and
con&s;equently the Blood running into <HI>Vi&s;ci|dity</HI>
and <HI>Size.</HI> It is true, a deep Cold will
bring on a tran&s;ient and acute Vi&s;cidity, which
may be &s;oon remov'd by &s;oft and <HI>Diaphoretic</HI>
Medicines; but the true <HI>chronical</HI> and dureable
<HI>Size,</HI> can only come from the <HI>Salts, Spirits</HI>
and <HI>Oils</HI> of fermented Liquors, compre&s;&s;ing
and breaking the <HI>Blood-Globules:</HI> If this has
not come to &s;uch a Degree, as actually to kill
the <HI>Seminal Animalcula</HI> in the Parents, it
may tho' thus make the Blood &s;o <HI>vi&s;cous,</HI> as to
<PB N="115" REF="132">
produce <HI>Fits,</HI> or other mortal Di&s;tempers in the
Infant, or &s;ome Acute or Chronical Di&s;tempers
in its more advanced Age, e&s;pecially when the
Party has come to its full Growth, the Solids
are developed and fix'd for &s;ome time in their
Exten&s;ion; which may happen at any Time,
but chiefly about Thirty-five, or towards the
<HI>Meridian</HI> of the now common Length of Life.
For though a Per&s;on is born with &s;uch a cor|rupt
and &s;izy Blood from his Parents, yet while
the Solids and Ve&s;&s;els are developing, un|&s;tretched
and extending, this <HI>Size</HI> and <HI>Cra&s;|&s;ity</HI>
may not appear to the Sen&s;es, even on
Blood-letting, till about or towards the Time
mentioned, becau&s;e from the Fibres and Coats
of the Ve&s;&s;els &s;tretching and yielding, the
Globules are not &s;o compre&s;&s;ed, as to be
broken and disfigured, which is nece&s;&s;ary to|wards
the Production of this <HI>Size.</HI> The Glo|bules
may be approaching, but not come into
actual Contact and Compre&s;&s;ion. I never
&s;aw a deep ob&s;tinate <HI>Chronical</HI> Di&s;temper,
without <HI>&s;izy</HI> Blood, at lea&s;t in its la&s;t Stage,
nor do I think it po&s;&s;ible.</P>

No&s;e, after a long <HI>Hemorrhage,</HI> and of pure
white Blood, by Dr. <HI>Beal,</HI> and &s;uch-like

the <HI>Cra&s;&s;amentum</HI> or <HI>Grume,</HI> which hinder

tho&s;e who were much &s;ubject to <HI>Coughs,

have always had bad Blood: Nor is it po&s;&s;ible
it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e; the <HI>venal</HI> Blood is
of a &s;en&s;ibly paler and fainter <HI>Red,</HI> than the

from the Juices &s;olely that all the <HI>Solids</HI> are
repair'd and increas'd; and <HI>Medicines</HI> can do
little or nothing but on the&s;e Juices: The <HI>So|lids,</HI>
by their malignant Nature, may be
broken, putrify'd or relax'd; but can &s;carce

than they are con&s;tituted by Nature; &s;o that
removing Impediments from them, and bring|ing

that can be done; and even that is only by
the Intermediation of &s;ound Juices: So that

determin the original <HI>Firmne&s;s, Force</HI> and
<HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> of the <HI>Solids,</HI> a <HI>Regimen</HI> might be
readily found, that &s;hould thin and dilute the

which Qualities make the proper and peculiar
Excellency of <HI>Mercury</HI> above all other Me|dicines.

When it is given <HI>crude</HI> and in Sub|&s;tance,

Matter with which <HI>Quick&s;ilver,</HI> with Labour

mixt. It may be united either with
<HI>Salts</HI> by <HI>Chymical</HI> Fires, as in <HI>Sublimat, Pre|cipitat,
Calomel,</HI> and the like; but as the
<HI>Salts,</HI> when thus divided, have a &s;trong <HI>Sti|mulus,</HI>
are extremely active, and &s;o nece&s;&s;a|rily
produce very violent Pains and Evacua|tions
of all kinds, <HI>qua data Porta,</HI> I think
they are extremely dangerous in delicate Con|&s;titutions,
and tender Bowels; e&s;pecially if they
mu&s;t be long continued, to alter the whole
Ma&s;s, and perform the Cure of a great and
&s;tubborn Di&s;temper: All of this kind I call
Mercurials <HI>cum Stimulo.</HI> 2&deg;. Or with <HI>Sul|phur,
Antimony,</HI> Sugar-candy, Turpentine,
Crabs-eyes, and the like; e&s;pecially &s;uch Bodies
as are harmle&s;s, and not violently active Medi|cines,
and are not &s;o ready to run the Patient
into great <HI>Evacuations,</HI> and con&s;equently
more proper for tender Bowels, and weak
Con&s;titutions, when de&s;ign'd as <HI>Alteratives.
Sulphur</HI> in <HI>Aethiops</HI> indeed will gripe and
purge there, but this is readily prevented, by
joining equal Quantities of <HI>Crabs-eyes, Crocus
Martis, A&s;tringens</HI> or proper <HI>te&s;taceous</HI> Pow|ders,
which by their ab&s;orbent Quality will
make this an admirable, ea&s;y and &s;afe Medicine,
I think, above all others, if long continued, as
I have often found with great Plea&s;ure. <HI>Cin|nabar</HI>
native, but e&s;pecially recent, and much
levigated, and <HI>factitious</HI> al&s;o, is as &s;afe and
ea&s;y as Sugar, but mu&s;t be long continued to
produce any &s;en&s;ible Benefit, being weak,
<PB N="124" REF="141">
though of all the Preparations it is the mo&s;t
proper, and will at la&s;t have the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t
Effect on very &s;lender Habits, becau&s;e tender
Con&s;titutions are more ea&s;ily alter'd. The
<HI>Alcali&s;atus,</HI> by the &s;trong <HI>Friction</HI> required
to unite the <HI>Mercury</HI> with the <HI>Crabs-eyes,</HI>
divides it the mo&s;t minutely; and by the
natural Poro&s;ity of the <HI>Crabs-eyes,</HI> there are
prepar'd <HI>Celluls</HI> to &s;eparate and retain them
a&s;under, whereby it would be the mo&s;t &s;afe
active Preparation hitherto, I think, found
out; but that, like <HI>Calomel,</HI> from its infinite
Divi&s;ion, and the Smallne&s;s of the Particles,
it is apt to <HI>&s;alivate,</HI> if given in any Quantity
without inter&s;pers'd <HI>Cathartics:</HI> But every
Preparation of <HI>Mercury</HI> hitherto in U&s;e will
do the &s;ame, except <HI>Cinnabar,</HI> and therefore
mu&s;t be watch'd. But, I think, the mo&s;t
effectual way of admini&s;tring <HI>Mercury</HI> to a
given Di&s;temper, is to unite and combine it
(by Pounding, Rubbing, or with Fire) with
that &s;pecific Medicine, that has been found
mo&s;t effectual in that <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e:</HI> Thus, for Ex|ample,
in the <HI>Scurvy, Gout, Ery&s;ipelas</HI> and
cutaneous <HI>Defedations,</HI> plain <HI>Quick&s;ilver,
Aethiops,</HI> or <HI>Alcali&s;atus</HI> well rubb'd into

the&s;e join'd to <HI>Gum</HI> Pills, with an
Aloetic, or Extract of the <HI>Bark,</HI> or of wild
<HI>Valerian</HI> with <HI>Millepedae,</HI> the&s;e, I &s;ay, in &s;uch

of any thing known, that then another
Medicine or Medicines may be joined to it,
that is known or acknowledged to be mo&s;t

to <HI>Cows Milk;</HI> with others it curdles,
and either binds too much, or purges, or &s;o
inflates and comes off in <HI>Phlegm,</HI> that they
cannot take it without abundance of Pain and
Suffering, which is an infinite Lo&s;s to them,
it being the &s;afe&s;t, gentle&s;t and mo&s;t certain
and univer&s;al <HI>Antidote</HI> in all <HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;|tempers,
without Exception of one. The only
certain way to make it agree, is fir&s;t to clean&s;e
the <HI>Primae Viae</HI> by <HI>Vomits,</HI> or an Aloetic
Pill now and then, mixing the <HI>Milk</HI> at fir&s;t
with <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> or any other &s;oft, but <HI>chalky</HI>
Water, making it into a Gruel or Pudding
with Seeds, as <HI>Barley, Oats, Wheat, Sago,
Rice,</HI> and the like, putting &s;ometimes a
Spoonful of White Wine to it; making
Bread into Biskets with &s;weet Cow Milk,
without <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> or <HI>Salt,</HI> with a quick Fireing,
taking little at a time, but often; or, la&s;tly,
putting a Spoonful of Compound Peony-water
into a Quart, or a Tea Spoonful of
Spirit of Hart&s;horn to a Pint; and thus gra|dually
carrying off the Load, Heavine&s;s,
and Flatulence or Tumult it &s;eems to rai&s;e,
which entirely proceeds from the ill State of
the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Bowels,</HI> that by a Di&s;temper
<PB N="129" REF="146">
are loaded with <HI>Wind, Choler</HI> and <HI>Phlegm,</HI>
where the <HI>concoctive</HI> Powers are inflamed
greatly, the <HI>Glands</HI> tumid, the <HI>Lacteals</HI> ob|&s;tructed,
the <HI>Per&s;piration</HI> &s;topp'd, the Blood
<HI>vi&s;cid,</HI> and all the <HI>Functions</HI> in a ruinous
State; and not from the Nature of <HI>Milk,</HI>
which is the milde&s;t, &s;ofte&s;t, mo&s;t nouri&s;hing,
and &s;alutary of all Foods; and the vulgar
Error of its being <HI>Phlegmatic,</HI> is from its be|ing
the be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual of all Bal&s;a|mics
and all Lambatives: As we &s;ee it is
form'd by the Hand of Nature, for the Young,
that is, the Weak and Tender; and there is no
real Difference between a weak tender <HI>Ani|mal</HI>
by <HI>Nature,</HI> and one made &s;o by a <HI>Di&s;|ea&s;e,</HI>
but that the Ca&s;e is much wor&s;e in the
<HI>la&s;t</HI> than the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and therefore this natural
<HI>Antidote</HI> is more nece&s;&s;ary in it: And I never
knew one who labour'd and endeavour'd
heartily at it, but at la&s;t overcame the&s;e Dif|ficulties
to his great Plea&s;ure and Satisfac|tion,
unle&s;s the Ca&s;e was totally gone:
Drinking a little Green Tea, or tepid <HI>Barley</HI> or
<HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Water, when it oppre&s;&s;es, will help it
off and relieve. What makes <HI>Milk</HI> at fir&s;t &s;o
di&s;agreeable, painful and oppre&s;&s;ive, is the
inflammatory <HI>bilious</HI> and <HI>acrimonious</HI> State of
the Stomach and Bowels, which pre&s;ently
turns the <HI>Milk</HI> into a hard chee&s;y Curd, and
&s;ends off the Whey into the <HI>Lacteals</HI> too
thin and too fa&s;t: Nothing in <HI>Milk</HI> but the
&s;weet white <HI>Whey,</HI> that is, the <HI>Serum,</HI> with the
<PB N="130" REF="147">
lighte&s;t and &s;malle&s;t Particles of the Curd,
nouri&s;hes, or can enter the &s;treight and invi|&s;ible
Mouths of the <HI>Lacteals;</HI> and hence only
is the nutritive Virtue of <HI>A&s;&s;es, Womens</HI> and
<HI>Mares Milk,</HI> and <HI>Goats-whey.</HI> Strong <HI>Runnet,</HI>
or any &s;trong Acid, will turn <HI>Milk</HI> into a hard
chee&s;y <HI>Curd,</HI> which will neither come up
nor go down without much Labour,
Struggle, and Oppre&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially in weak
or <HI>bilious</HI> Stomachs; weak <HI>Runnet</HI> will make
a tender <HI>Curd,</HI> which will ea&s;ily &s;lide off: So
that the whole <HI>Art</HI> of making Milk agree
with any Stomach, is to prevent its turning
into too hard a <HI>Curd,</HI> which any <HI>Alcali</HI> will
do, Sugar, Crabs-eyes, <HI>Chalk,</HI> the <HI>volatil</HI>
Spirits, and the like. As the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> cool,
and the <HI>Choler</HI> le&s;&s;ens, the Di&s;orders from
<HI>Milk</HI> evani&s;h. However, I &s;hould advi&s;e
tho&s;e who&s;e Stomach abounds with <HI>Bile,</HI> and
&s;o is in an inflammatory State, to live on
Seeds, mealy and &s;oft Roots, and well-dre&s;s'd
Vegetables, for &s;ome time, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who
have bad <HI>Livers,</HI> and an Overflowing of the
<HI>Gall;</HI> for as to <HI>con&s;umptive, &s;crophulous, &s;corbu|tical,
diabetical</HI> and <HI>cancerous</HI> Ca&s;es, Milk and
Seeds are the be&s;t <HI>Antidot,</HI> and &s;eldom di&s;|agrees.
I have been told of two <HI>Pigs,</HI> fed one
with the &s;ame Quantity of <HI>Milk,</HI> the other with
&s;weet <HI>Cow whey;</HI> the la&s;t became the fatte&s;t,
white&s;t and &s;weete&s;t. But the mo&s;t infallible Re|medy
is for a long Time to chew a little good
<HI>Bark</HI> at Noon, and &s;ome <HI>Rhubarb</HI> at Night con|&s;tantly,
<PB N="131" REF="148">
at lea&s;t till this Difficulty is overcome:
The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> gives a Ten&s;ion and Spring to the
Coats of the <HI>chyliferous</HI> Tube, the <HI>&s;econd</HI>
does not only the &s;ame, but al&s;o carries off
the Load and Superfluity from it, before it ac|cumulats
and acidulats too high. <HI>Sweet Cow-whey,</HI>

in <HI>&s;corbutic</HI> and <HI>cacochymic</HI> Habits, in
<HI>bilious</HI> Vomitings, and <HI>hectic</HI> or low feveri&s;h
Ca&s;es: It is preferable to mo&s;t, if not all
&s;orts of Diet-drinks, <HI>anti&s;corbutic</HI> Juices or
<HI>Pti&s;ans;</HI> and they who would, at lea&s;t all the
Summer Months, drink a Quart of this, more
or le&s;s, half in the Morning, and half at

Fevers, violent gouty <HI>Paroxy&s;ms</HI> in
Winter, <HI>&s;corbutic</HI> and <HI>&s;crophulous</HI> Humours

<P>&sect;. 13. <HI>GOATS-MILK,</HI> or rather its
<HI>Whey,</HI> is a wonderful Strengthener and Clean|&s;er.
It is &s;urpri&s;ing to me, that our Country|men,

<HI>Cures</HI> in deplorable Ca&s;es, perform'd by the

any <HI>artificial</HI> Diet-drink what&s;oever; and in

<P>&sect;. 14. I SHOULD here &s;ay &s;omething of
<HI>Womens Milk,</HI> which is indeed mo&s;t natural
and <HI>homogeneous</HI> to human Bodies in very
low <HI>con&s;umptive</HI> Ca&s;es, and is found extreme|ly
beneficial in them; not only to the Young
and Tender, but to the Ancient Tender,
and the Middle-aged, worn out by Di&s;ea&s;es.
This <HI>Milk</HI> would be infinitly more beneficial
and &s;alutary, were it not for the <HI>rank,</HI> high,

or unfermented Liquors, and were kept clean
and &s;weet, their Milk pa&s;&s;ing through infi|nitly
more fine and delicat <HI>Strainers</HI> than
tho&s;e of any <HI>brute</HI> Animal, would be a real

Ca&s;es: But on the contrary, as Things are
now con&s;tituted, <HI>Nur&s;es</HI> are the mo&s;t hu|morous,

of this <HI>Treati&s;e,</HI> that none can be
long, or grievou&s;ly ill, who has
good-condition'd Blood and Juices, except
from accidental or <HI>epidemical</HI> Di&s;tempers,
from an habitual <HI>Mal-Regimen</HI> of Diet, or
one which is improper for the Party, or from
<HI>me&s;eraic</HI> Ob&s;tructions, or <HI>&s;cirrhous</HI> abdominal
Glands. The mo&s;t univer&s;al, efficacious and
<PB N="136" REF="152">
adequat Cau&s;e of Di&s;tempers, is a con&s;tant
and habitual Neglect of the &s;ole univer&s;al
Antidot, or Pre&s;ervative again&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es,
<HI>viz.</HI> the LIGHTEST and the LEAST of
Meat and Drink a Man can be tolerably ea&s;y
under. If the Per&s;on has brought into the
World a <HI>Taint</HI> of his Parents corrupt Juices,
or a natural Tendency of the Animal <HI>Salts,</HI>
Spirits, and Blood <HI>Globules,</HI> to run into
Clu&s;ters, to unite, and be compre&s;s'd, that is,
to beget foul and &s;izy Blood; and if he does
not duly and properly pro&s;ecute a thinning,
low, cool, <HI>bal&s;amic</HI> Regimen, gentle Evacu|ations,
and &s;weetening <HI>alterative</HI> Medicins,
but goes on in the common <HI>high Diet</HI> of the
<HI>Voluptuous,</HI> and the Exce&s;&s;es of tho&s;e who are
born healthy and &s;trong, and with &s;weet
Juices, he may be ailing, &s;ickly, and tender

as quite to &s;poil &s;ome of the great and noble
<HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> or putrify the <HI>Canals</HI> them&s;elves, he
mu&s;t &s;oon and infallibly die. But if one has
come into the World duly form'd with &s;weet
Blood and Juices, (like that of a Lamb) but
by a con&s;tant Neglect of the <HI>Lighte&s;t</HI> and
the <HI>Lea&s;t,</HI> &s;poils and corrupts his Blood and

by many &s;low Steps and Degrees, and with
different Circum&s;tances, according to the na|tural
Formation and Habitudes, and the Na|ture

in them originally, or an Adhe&s;ion to the

Con&s;umption</HI> or <HI>Drop&s;y.</HI> The &s;ame
<HI>&s;izy</HI> Blood, and vi&s;cid <HI>Serum,</HI> if the <HI>Lungs</HI> be
tolerably &s;trong and well-form'd, (which cor|rupted
Juices always fir&s;t try to break, and
hence the vulgar Notion, that <HI>Colds</HI> are the
univer&s;al Cau&s;e of Di&s;ea&s;es) will &s;top in the
<HI>capillary</HI> Arteries, and Veins, which cau&s;es a
<HI>Rheumati&s;m,</HI> univer&s;al or particular: If thro
their natural Strength and Spring, all the
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els are not ob&s;tructed, then the mo&s;t
&s;izy and inflammatory Part is thrown on the&s;e
<HI>Organs</HI> and Limbs, where the <HI>Capillaries</HI> are
mo&s;t compre&s;s'd, and lea&s;t roomy, <HI>viz.</HI> the

<HI>Serum,</HI> be&s;ides its Size, be full of <HI>Salts</HI> and
<HI>Sulphurs,</HI> then come <HI>cutaneous</HI> Foulne&s;&s;es
and Inflammations, as <HI>Eri&s;ipelas, &s;corbutie
Eruptions, Lepro&s;y, bilious</HI> Ulcers, and the
like. If a particular <HI>Organ,</HI> as the <HI>Liver,</HI> be

large, hard and unyeilding) the <HI>Bile</HI> &s;tagnats

or Stones are formed in the <HI>Gall-blad|der,</HI>
and &s;o a <HI>Jaundice</HI> en&s;ues. If the whole
Ma&s;s of Blood and Juices be corrupted, and
no one particular Part is weaker than another,
but the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of both <HI>Solids</HI> and
<HI>Fluids</HI> is di&s;order'd, the Juices &s;izy, and the

<HI>animal</HI> Functions labour; and thence the

But univer&s;ally all the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es come from
&s;poil'd, vi&s;cid, <HI>&s;alin</HI> or <HI>inflammatory</HI> Juices, as
their primary and productive Cau&s;e, or what
is commonly meant by a &s;corbutic Habit;
at lea&s;t all the Good the be&s;t <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> can
do, is on the&s;e Juices; the Solids we can but
little alter after Maturity.</P>
<P>&sect;. 2. IN all Ca&s;es where there is a quick
&s;trong <HI>Pul&s;e,</HI> or where there is a weak quick
<HI>Pul&s;e,</HI> though &s;mall, but oppre&s;s'd, or <HI>la|bouring,</HI>
if it continue, and the Head aches,
or is confu&s;ed; in all <HI>inflammatory</HI> Ca&s;es,
&s;uch as <HI>Ery&s;ipelas,</HI> the <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> a painful <HI>Rheu|mati&s;m,</HI>
a <HI>Pleuri&s;y,</HI> or the like; in all Ca&s;es
attended with violent or acute Pain, be
where it will; in almo&s;t every Ca&s;e of a Di&s;|temper,
(if nothing ab&s;olutely forbid it) in the
<HI>fir&s;t In&s;tance,</HI> Bleeding is ab&s;olutely fit and
indi&s;pen&s;able; and in painful Ca&s;es with a
<PB N="139" REF="155">
quick Pul&s;e, it ought to be plentiful at fir&s;t, and
repeated once or twice, or oftener, till the
Pain abates, and the Pul&s;e &s;ub&s;ides; for in all
&s;uch Ca&s;es, the Blood is either <HI>too much, too
hot,</HI> or <HI>too &s;izy,</HI> and generally all together:
As to the particular Vein or Artery (if nece&s;|&s;ary)
whence the Blood is to be taken, it is
of no great Con&s;equence; but for a pre&s;ent
Relief, the nearer the Part principally affected,
the better. But I &s;hould always prefer, in Chro|nical
Ca&s;es, &s;mall and <HI>partial</HI> Bleedings, often
repeated, to too large and plentiful ones; in
every Ca&s;e, and even in <HI>eruptive</HI> and <HI>gouty</HI> Ca&s;es,
the Eruption will be &s;ooner and fuller, and
the <HI>Gout</HI> become more regular on Bleeding,
if it is not too large; the Veins and Arteries
thereby become more roomy, the Re&s;i&s;tance
in the Circulation is le&s;s, the Force of the
Heart, and of the <HI>mu&s;cular</HI> Coats of the
Blood-ve&s;&s;els, becomes greater, in Proportion
to the Re&s;i&s;tance of the le&s;s Quantity of <HI>Blood</HI>
remaining, thereby to accelerat the <HI>Circula|tion,</HI>
and forcibly to throw the peccant Hu|mours
on the Parts Nature de&s;igns them, the
mo&s;t remote from the noble <HI>Organs:</HI> And
when any of the mentioned <HI>Symptoms</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;t,
I think a Repetition of Bleeding ought not
to be he&s;itated upon, which, timeou&s;ly and free|ly
perform'd, has &s;aved many a Life. <HI>Half</HI> a
Pound, or a <HI>whole,</HI> or even <HI>Two</HI> Pounds at differ|ent
Times, out of Thirty, or perhaps Forty or
Fifty in the Whole, will never bring any one into
<PB N="140" REF="156">
a Di&s;ea&s;e, or real Danger; for Di&s;ea&s;es are in the
bad Blood, and Life will be carried on, and even
very tolerably, (at lea&s;t for a time) if the great
<HI>Organs</HI> of Sanguification be &s;ound and &s;trong,
even with <HI>A&s;&s;es Milk, Chicken-water,</HI> or
even <HI>Water-gruel,</HI> running only into the
Blood, which will at la&s;t, by the Laws of <HI>San|guification,</HI>
turn into good Blood, as we
know from great Wounds, the Experiments
of <HI>Transfu&s;ion,</HI> and violent <HI>Haemorrhages.</HI>
Lowne&s;s, Faintne&s;s, and a Di&s;ability of Mo|tion,
may en&s;ue on too great Bleeding, which
ought not to be practi&s;ed, but only &s;mall
frequent <HI>Phlebotomies;</HI> and the&s;e Lowne&s;&s;es
are not Di&s;tempers that will endanger Life or
Health; and by a proper <HI>Regimen,</HI> the Ca&s;e
will be con&s;tantly much mended from the
better Ma&s;s of Blood remaining: And it is
not an unplea&s;ant <HI>Speculation</HI> to ob&s;erve, that
by the <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI> of the Body, when a <HI>Vein</HI>
is open'd with a large Orifice, every <HI>Phlebo|tomy</HI>
draws out a larger Quantity of the vi&s;|cous
or bad Blood than of the good or fluid
Blood, in Proportion to the whole remain|ing
Ma&s;s; becau&s;e in the running Ma&s;s the
bad, <HI>i. e.</HI> the lighte&s;t Blood, by the circular
Pre&s;&s;ion of all Fluids, is thrown outwards to
the Sides of its containing <HI>Tubes;</HI> and the good,
<HI>i. e.</HI> the heavie&s;t Blood, runs in the Middle,
as is demon&s;trable from the Laws of <HI>Hydro|&s;tatics;</HI>
and by Experience we find frequent
Bleeding will exhau&s;t all the &s;izy Blood at la&s;t.

Proportion of the <HI>Grume</HI> to the <HI>Serum</HI> pretty
near equal, the <HI>Grume</HI> not very vi&s;cid, and
the <HI>Serum</HI> not much di&s;colour'd, nor &s;alti&s;h,
then I conclude, after the <HI>Univer&s;alia,</HI> a <HI>Re|gimen,</HI>
and Medicins for &s;trengthening and
winding up the Solids, with Air, Exerci&s;e and

if the Blood, when let out of a large Ori|fice,
and quite &s;eparated, has a <HI>Buff</HI> or bluei&s;h
Skin on the Top, is liveri&s;h, the <HI>Serum</HI> di&s;pro|portion'd,
di&s;colour'd and <HI>&s;alti&s;h,</HI> to a great
Degree, then I am &s;atisfy'd the Patient will
never be quite well, nor continue long in an
uniform and durable State of Health, without
&s;weetening, thinning and mending his Blood;
and then I order (with a Diet) &s;ome Prepara|tion
of the <HI>ponderous</HI> Medicines, with the
Juice of &s;ome anti&s;corbutic or alterative
Plants, proper and &s;pecific for the Complaints
and <HI>Symptoms,</HI> and a daily or familiar and gentle
<HI>Evacuation,</HI> to rectify the&s;e, and at proper
Di&s;tances during the <HI>Cure,</HI> partial and &s;mall

morbid Juices, and rectify the whole Ma&s;s;

frequent and &s;mall <HI>Bleedings</HI> contribute to
quicken and accelerat this thorough Change

will al&s;o be much reliev'd; and if the
<HI>Phlebotomies</HI> be prudently and properly
tim'd, may be very little or none at all, e&s;pe|cially
when the Blood is very bad: So that,
on the Whole, gentle, partial and regulated
<HI>Phlebotomies,</HI> as the Patient can bear, or the
Ca&s;e indicats, is one of the mo&s;t general,

under a <HI>Diet</HI> not forcing or feeding the <HI>Hae|morrhage,</HI>
the Blood will &s;top of it&s;elf, when

Some <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> have alledg'd, that there is
no certain <HI>Progno&s;tic</HI> to be made of the
State of the Patient, or Nature of the Di&s;|temper,
from the Appearances of the Blood

on it. But the&s;e <HI>Gentlemen</HI> may with
as much Rea&s;on di&s;pute the Evidence of our
Sen&s;es in other Ca&s;es: We know good or bad
Blood by the &s;ame <HI>Marks</HI> and <HI>Criterions,</HI> that
we judge of our Meat and Drink: Good

With what I call bad Blood, a Man may go

vomit twice a Month, and the <HI>lean,</HI> once.
<HI>Vomits</HI> not only throw off concocted Impu|rities

an <HI>Haemorrhage, Haemoptoe</HI> or <HI>Rupture</HI> of

<P>&sect;. 4. NOTHING I know, or have tried,
can &s;upply the Place of a <HI>Vomit,</HI> when fit or
nece&s;&s;ary, but <HI>Quick&s;ilver,</HI> or &s;ome of its
Preparations, &s;uch as <HI>Calomel, Alcali&s;atus,
Aethiops,</HI> and the like, join'd with a Purga|tive,
as <HI>Pilulae Ruffi, Cochiae Minores, de
Aloe lot.</HI> Jalap, Rhubarb, or the like. Quick|&s;ilver
well kill'd, with any proper Mucilage,
and a Purgative join'd, is the &s;ame with <HI>Bello&s;te</HI>'s
Pills, found &s;o effectual in many Ca&s;es, which
thus may be much more properly fitted to the
Patient and the Ca&s;e, than the&s;e general Quack
Medicins can be. The&s;e, &s;ome time continued,
will by Degrees open the <HI>Glands,</HI> to make
them &s;pue out their gro&s;s and &s;uperfluous Con|tents,
and carry off by their Weight, and deob|&s;truent
Powers, the Crudities and Superfluities
of the Stomach and Bowels. But they will nei|ther
do it &s;o &s;oon, &s;o effectually, nor &s;o dureably
as <HI>Vomits</HI> repeated, according to the Indications
of Nature from the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of a <HI>Nau&s;ea, Op|pre&s;&s;ion,
Flatulence, Watchfulne&s;s, Sickne&s;s,
Inquietude</HI> and <HI>Inappetency;</HI> and both toge|ther,
I think, no cureable chronical Di&s;temper
<PB N="148" REF="164">
could with&s;tand. However, in Per&s;ons fear|ful
of <HI>Vomits,</HI> or where from a Rupture, or
other forbidding Indication, they cannot be
&s;afely given, the&s;e are the only efficacious
Medicins that can &s;upply their Place; at lea&s;t,
I think, they mu&s;t be of this Tribe or Nature,
fitted nicely to the Delicacy of the Patient, and
the Nature of the Di&s;temper; and I will venture
to affirm, that all the <HI>Quack</HI> Medicins of any
Virtue or Efficacy, however diver&s;ify'd, have
had <HI>Mercury</HI> in &s;ome Preparation, <HI>Antimony,</HI>
and its Preparations, or &s;ome of the more dan|gerous
mineral Medicins, (as <HI>Ar&s;enic</HI> or <HI>Cobalt</HI>)
with or without one kind of <HI>Carthartic</HI> or an|other,
for their <HI>Ba&s;e.</HI> For <HI>mineral</HI> Medicins
&s;eem de&s;ign'd by Nature for high Feeders, and
&s;trong Con&s;titutions; and Vegetable ones, or
mineral Waters, (as well as a vegetable Diet)
for weak and delicat Con&s;titutions, e&s;pecially
when already under a low or <HI>vegetable Diet;</HI>
and I am of Opinion, the more &s;imple the
<HI>Mercurials</HI> and <HI>Cathartics</HI> are, both are the
better and &s;afer. I think the Practice of Me|dicin
has receiv'd great Benefit from the now
experienc'd and familiar U&s;e of <HI>Quick&s;ilver,</HI>
and its various Preparations; e&s;pecially &s;ince
the univer&s;al Prejudice and Terror of it, and
of its being appropriated to one Di&s;temper
only, is &s;o worn off; and it is now under the
Management of tho&s;e who under&s;tand its Na|ture
and Operations, and that of the <HI>animal Oeco|nomy.</HI>
Plain Quick&s;ilver is certainly as inno|cent
<PB N="149" REF="165">
and &s;afe as <HI>A&s;&s;es Milk,</HI> if judiciou&s;ly and in
proper Ca&s;es pre&s;cribed. I have often known
it do no manner of Good, but never knew
it do much Hurt, unle&s;s over-dos'd, or with|out
inter&s;pers'd Purgatives, or given in an im|proper
Ca&s;e. In <HI>a&s;thmatic</HI> Ca&s;es, <HI>&s;crophulous
Ulcers,</HI> in <HI>Tumours,</HI> Foulne&s;&s;es, and <HI>Ob&s;truc|tions</HI>
of the <HI>alimentary</HI> Tube, of the <HI>Me&s;en|tery,
Lacteals</HI> and other internal <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI>
&s;well'd and &s;cirrhous <HI>Glands</HI> in any Part of
the Body, a <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> or <HI>Scurvy,</HI> and vi&s;cid
Blood and Juices, I think, <HI>Hydrargyrum
di&s;tillatum,</HI> properly combin'd, is Sovereign,
and the true <HI>Panacea</HI> appointed and mark'd
out from its own <HI>Signature</HI> by Heaven; for it
is the only known &s;imple Fluid except Water
and Air: Nothing but a <HI>low Diet</HI> can equal
its Efficacy, and both, judiciou&s;ly join'd, will
<HI>cure</HI> every Di&s;temper <HI>cureable.</HI> I do not know
if it would not be beneficial even in <HI>cancerous</HI>
and <HI>&s;cirrhous</HI> Ca&s;es, at lea&s;t at fir&s;t, e&s;pecially if
the &s;cirrhous and cancerous <HI>Glands</HI> were cut out,
and the <HI>corrupted</HI> Part could po&s;&s;ibly be quite
taken away; for there can be no Danger but
from its <HI>Gravity,</HI> and that might be prevented
by &s;mall <HI>Do&s;es,</HI> its deleterious Qualities being
none; for it is never changed into any other
Nature by Mixture or Divi&s;ion, but always
re&s;olves it&s;elf into <HI>&s;imilar</HI> le&s;&s;er Parts of the
&s;ame <HI>&s;pecific</HI> Nature. It would at lea&s;t mend
the whole Ma&s;s of the Juices, and open all the
Ob&s;tructions, except in that particular <HI>Gland</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="166">
or <HI>cancerous</HI> Part; all the Ill it could do even
there, would be from an <HI>Haemorrhage</HI> or
<HI>Haemoptoe,</HI> or its Bur&s;ting; and if the Blood
is mended, that would be none at all: But I
&s;hould not advi&s;e it, till the corrupt Part was
cut out, if po&s;&s;ible. But in no <HI>cancerous</HI>
Ca&s;e whatever can <HI>Quick&s;ilver-water</HI> hurt;
but on the contrary, long and ob&s;tinately
per&s;i&s;ted in, and drunk plentifully, will do all
that any other <HI>Preparation of Mercury,</HI> or
the crude it&s;elf can do, without any Po&s;&s;i|bility
of Danger, e&s;pecially join'd with a <HI>total
Milk and Seed Diet,</HI> which timeou&s;ly begun,
I think, would antidote any cancerous Hu|mour
whatever. I am a&s;&s;ured of a perfect
Cure of a Cancer in the Tongue, which had
re&s;i&s;ted an Infinity of all Sorts of Medicins,
cured by liveing eighteen Months on A&s;&s;es
Milk &s;olely and only.</P>
<P>&sect;. 5. THE &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t effectual way
of takeing <HI>Quick&s;ilver,</HI> is after it has been
di&s;tilled, well wa&s;h'd with Salt and Water,
and pa&s;s'd throgh Chamois Leather, to purge
it of all its <HI>heterogenous Mixtures,</HI> (with
which the Dealers in it <HI>&s;ophi&s;ticat</HI> it, and
render it not only often ineffectual, but ex|tremely
pernicious) to take it in a Quill or
clean <HI>Tobacco-pipe,</HI> about half an Ounce
Morning and Night, and once a Week a
gentle <HI>Stomach</HI> Purge of a Scruple or half a
Drachm of Jalap with Nutmeg, (in <HI>a&s;thmatic</HI>

well incorporated, or <HI>de Aloe lot.</HI> or
<HI>Rhubarb,</HI> in <HI>nervous, &s;tomachic,</HI> or <HI>&s;crophu|lous</HI>
Ca&s;es, to prevent its lodging in the
Glands or Plicatures of the <HI>Guts,</HI> and to
carry off all the Foulne&s;s, that it may di&s;en|gage
or force off from the <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> and to
prevent its &s;alivating, which this Management
will do (for we have now certain Evidence,
that it will pa&s;s through every Pore, and even
through the &s;olid <HI>parenchymatous</HI> Sub&s;tance of
every Bowel and <HI>Membrane,</HI> when got to the
Capillaries, and &s;maller Arteries, more readily
almo&s;t, than it will through <HI>Chamois</HI> Leather);
and with it, in very bad <HI>cachectic</HI> and <HI>cacochymic</HI>
Habits, and <HI>cancerous</HI> or <HI>&s;crophulous</HI> Ca&s;es, to
direct a total Milk and Seed Diet, and Ab&s;ti|nence
from fermented Liquors; and even in
middling Ca&s;es, and Di&s;orders of the <HI>ali|mentary
Tube</HI> only, to direct a very cool, low
Broth or white Meat Diet, or rather that
which I call the <HI>trimming</HI> or middling Diet,
of one Day white <HI>animal Food,</HI> and another
<HI>Milk and Seed Meats,</HI> without fermented
Liquors. Thus manag'd, <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> would
perform great Cures, as I have &s;een; and in
bad Ca&s;es, where it has done nothing, I greatly
&s;u&s;pect, it has been becau&s;e it has not been thus
manag'd, <HI>viz.</HI> with a low, or Milk and Seed
Diet, and inter&s;pers'd Stomach Purges.</P>

only the&s;e per&s;piratory, hot and forceing Me|dicines

Expectation is to be put in them further, but
as one who &s;tands to draw his Breath only for
a Moment, when he has a &s;teep Hill to

duely treated by the altering ponderous
Remedies, and a <HI>Regimen,</HI> which alone can
obviate their ill Effects, not of the Intermit|tents,
(for all <HI>acute</HI> Di&s;tempers, and indeed all
Di&s;tempers whatever, are a Labour of Nature
to purify the Juices, according to the common
Saying, <HI>Dolor e&s;t Medicina doloris</HI>) but the
bad State of the Fluids, which cau&s;es them;
and therefore they may come into my De|&s;ign
<PB N="160" REF="176">
of treating here of <HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers
only; e&s;pecially &s;ince they have been &s;o vari|ous
and complicated of late Years. Indeed
almo&s;t all <HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers admit of the&s;e
<HI>Periods</HI> in &s;ome Degree or another: The <HI>Gout,</HI>
the <HI>Rheumati&s;m,</HI> but e&s;pecially tho&s;e called
<HI>nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers, have generally one Day
or more wor&s;e, and another better &s;en&s;ibly.
As to a true, &s;imple, genuine <HI>Intermittent,</HI> it
is mo&s;t infallibly the <HI>Struggle</HI> and Labour of a
<HI>&s;izy</HI> Blood, when a great Part of the <HI>Size</HI>
has been gradually accumulated, and collected
towards the Middle of the &s;mall Pa&s;&s;age from
the <HI>Arteries</HI> into the <HI>Veins,</HI> or the lateral
Branches of both; for the <HI>Arteries</HI> converg|ing
gently, many of them terminat in the
<HI>Veins</HI> in one continued <HI>Tube,</HI> (except the la|teral
ones, which form the <HI>Glands</HI>) which
again gently diverging (at lea&s;t the <HI>Trunk|pipes</HI>)
form, as it were, a double <HI>Cone:</HI> The
Blood, when &s;izy, pa&s;&s;ing with Difficulty this
middle narrow Space, (like the Waters of a
River, when the Chanel is narrow, and con|tracted
in one particular Place) rages, and runs
with <HI>Impetuo&s;ity;</HI> and the thinne&s;t getting
through fir&s;t, the <HI>Size</HI> is by Degrees left in
the wider Part of the <HI>Tube,</HI> till the Whole
of it comes to be collected at this narrow Pa&s;|&s;age.
Then, by Force of the <HI>Heart,</HI> and <HI>mu&s;|cular</HI>
Coats of the <HI>Arteries,</HI> the Whole of the
new-gather'd Ma&s;s of this <HI>Size</HI> being forc'd
to pa&s;s there al&s;o, by the Laws of the <HI>Circu|lation,
<PB N="161" REF="177">
Nature</HI> and the whole <HI>animal Oeco|nomy</HI>
labours to effect it: hence fir&s;t the <HI>Chill,</HI>
and <HI>Rigours</HI> in this Labour of Nature, becau&s;e
little warm Blood can reach the <HI>Capillary</HI>
Veins and Extremities. This Stage mu&s;t
always be attended with a <HI>quick Pul&s;e,</HI> tho'
the Patient may be in the <HI>Chill</HI> of Death, which
&s;hews the <HI>Heart</HI> and mu&s;cular Coats of the
<HI>Arteries</HI> are in violent Action and Labour,
while the <HI>Size</HI> is thus di&s;charging thro' this
narrow <HI>Pa&s;s.</HI> By this means the <HI>Size</HI> is in a
great Degree di&s;&s;olv'd and broken; and then
entering into the wider Veins, the <HI>Serum</HI>
being render'd thinner, is made capable to be
thrown off with Violence by the lateral
Branches, and the Orifices of the <HI>per&s;piratory
Ducts.</HI> The fine&s;t of its broken and watry
<HI>Particles</HI> get through, and the &s;erous Parts of
the Blood are thus di&s;charged by a profu&s;e
<HI>Sweat.</HI> This is not an <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> but the
real and true <HI>Theory</HI> of &s;imple and uncom|pounded
<HI>Intermittents,</HI> founded on Experi|ment,
which tho' are infinitely varied and com|plicated
according to the Degree of the <HI>Size,</HI>
the Con&s;titution and Age of the Patient, and
many other Cirum&s;tances, which I have not

<P>&sect;. 12. When an <HI>Intermittent</HI> happens, the

<HI>Gout, Rheumati&s;m, Jaundice, Scurvy, Ana|&s;arca,

their la&s;t Stages. I have known an <HI>Intermit|tent</HI>
happen, when the Blood has been in
a much better State, than it was before; <HI>viz.</HI>
after u&s;eing the proper Means of alterative
<HI>Ponderous</HI> Medicins, and a low Diet to mend
it. I always take it for a certain Sign of Con|vale&s;cence,
and a dureable Mending, when it
happens in a very bad Ca&s;e; and to be pro|duced
mo&s;tly and immediatly by the greater
Relaxation of the Solids, e&s;pecially when
under a cool low Diet, which the <HI>Bark</HI> and
other <HI>A&s;tringents</HI> quickly mend and wind
up. In &s;imple <HI>Intermittents,</HI> and young &s;ound

more Spring and Force, &s;o as to make the <HI>Size</HI>
pa&s;s through the <HI>Streights</HI> ea&s;ily, or di&s;charge

but the <HI>Bark</HI> as one of the be&s;t, coole&s;t, and
mo&s;t ea&s;ily dige&s;ted <HI>Vegetable A&s;tringents,</HI>
that cures <HI>Intermittents,</HI> as it gives a Firm|ne&s;s

and gives a due Cohe&s;ion and Con&s;i&s;tence to
<PB N="163" REF="179">
the <HI>Blood Globules</HI> thus broken and divided by
the Di&s;temper, and by the Labour of Nature,

Strainers and <HI>per&s;piratory Glands;</HI> but this
the Bark, or even any of the&s;e others men|tion'd,

two con&s;tantly &s;ecur'd again&s;t Relap&s;es, when
it fir&s;t came into <HI>Europe</HI>) will now do nothing.
The true Rea&s;on of which is not only the
<HI>Sophi&s;tication</HI> of the <HI>Quinquina,</HI> which now
out of Avarice (as all other foreign Medicins
are) is mixt with twenty other in&s;ignificant or
perhaps pernicious <HI>Barks,</HI> which are not ea&s;ily
di&s;cover'd or &s;eparated; but al&s;o from the
univer&s;al <HI>Depravation</HI> of the Blood and Hu|mours
of Patients now-a-days, to what they
might have been formerly: Upon which Ac|count
it is an excellent Preparative, not only
to cool and thin the Blood by previous <HI>Vomits,
Stomach Purges,</HI> and <HI>&s;alin</HI> Juice of Lemon
<HI>Draughts,</HI> and to unite <HI>Rhubarb</HI> with <HI>Bark</HI>
and <HI>Aromatics,</HI> but al&s;o to let the Patient have
as many <HI>Fits</HI> of the <HI>Fever</HI> as he can po&s;&s;ibly
bear, in order to attenuat and divide the
Blood in pa&s;&s;ing through the&s;e &s;treight and
<PB N="164" REF="180">
narrow Pa&s;&s;ages; and by the quicker <HI>Circula|tion</HI>
that nece&s;&s;arily attends it, before any <HI>&s;pe|cific</HI>
or &s;trong <HI>A&s;tringent</HI> be tried, to tighten
the Fibres, and &s;top the <HI>Paroxy&s;ms;</HI> and per|haps
the very be&s;t were to leave it intirely to
&s;uch general Medicins, that it might extin|gui&s;h
of it&s;elf; and then the Blood would be
eminently fined and thinned, and high Health
would en&s;ue. But &s;ince the Patient will &s;el|dom
&s;ubmit to this &s;o tedious a Cure, I think
there is no &s;uch certain and &s;alutary a Method,
as in the Intervals of the Fits to admini&s;ter
<HI>Vomits,</HI> and the <HI>mild Mercurials</HI> and <HI>Atte|nuants,</HI>
together with the <HI>Bark,</HI> to mend
the Blood and Juices; and therefore I never
fail, after I have for a due time &s;topt the fir&s;t

&s;ince <HI>Sydenham's</HI> Time. I &s;hall here only take
Notice of two things concerning this Di&s;tem|per:
<PB N="198" REF="214">
1&deg;. That I cannot be of Opinion, that
either the <HI>&s;mall</HI> or the <HI>great Pox,</HI> was origi|nally
a Di&s;temper peculiar and appropriated to
any certain Time or Climat, or <HI>endemial</HI>
any-where, no more than the <HI>Itch, Lepro&s;y,</HI>
or <HI>Plague.</HI> A particular <HI>Air, Climat,</HI> ori|ginal
<HI>Frame, Manner</HI> of Living, <HI>epidemical</HI>
Vices, and the like, may vary the <HI>Symptoms,</HI>
exa&s;perat and increa&s;e the Malignity and De|grees
of one Di&s;temper, called by &s;uch a Name,
more than another; as particular <HI>Species</HI> of
Plants differ by <HI>Culture, Sun,</HI> and <HI>Soil;</HI> but
that they &s;hould alter the particular Nature and
<HI>Species</HI> of a Di&s;temper, by which it is di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd
from all others, I think, is unnatural,
<HI>unphilo&s;ophical,</HI> and ab&s;urd. Di&s;ea&s;es have a
general Nature and <HI>Symptoms</HI> from the Habi|tudes
of the Patients, from the <HI>Climat</HI> and
<HI>Country,</HI> the <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Food;</HI> and they have a
particular Nature from their <HI>Seminium;</HI> and
they have Degrees or <HI>Symptoms</HI> from the Vices
and original <HI>Formation</HI> of <HI>Individuals.</HI> I
take the <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of a <HI>Venereal</HI> Di&s;temper to
ari&s;e from the Nature of that particular <HI>ani|mal
Salt</HI> which abounds in the <HI>Spermatic
Organs,</HI> and in the Sub&s;tance therein gene|rated;
and, to &s;peak more explicitly, I take it
to be a &s;ubtle, active and cau&s;tic <HI>Alcali,</HI> le&s;s
&s;ublim'd and volatil than that which is the
Cau&s;e of the <HI>Pe&s;tilence,</HI> and infinitly more
<HI>fine</HI> and volatil than our mo&s;t perfect com|mon

acrid and <HI>cau&s;tic,</HI> and &s;o produce what is

Salts,</HI> actuating <HI>&s;permatic</HI> Sub&s;tances of all

the Activity, <HI>Stimulus,</HI> and Titillation, of this

<P>&sect;. 31. I SHOULD &s;ay &s;omething here of the
<HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel,</HI> but that &s;ince the &s;ucce&s;s|ful
Experiments on Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicin,
and &s;ince it has been examin'd and approv'd
of by the Members of the <HI>College,</HI> and its
Efficacy explain'd and accounted for, from the
Principles of the be&s;t natural <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> and
its Form garbled and poli&s;h'd by two of the
<HI>worthie&s;t Men,</HI> and mo&s;t accurat Ob&s;ervers of
this Age; all I can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;t, can be of
little Value or U&s;e. Only &s;ince it has been
&s;urmis'd by &s;ome, and contradicted by none,
that <HI>vinous Beverage</HI> quickens and promotes
the Efficacy of the Medicins; I think my&s;elf
obliged to &s;ay &s;omething to this &s;eeming <HI>Ob|jection</HI>
to one great Principle I have laid down
(without Exception) in this Treati&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI>
That &s;ole Water drinking, in all Ca&s;es, is one
of the &s;ure&s;t Means to pre&s;erve or re&s;tore
Health, and that &s;trong fermented Liquor,
much le&s;s <HI>vinous Beverage,</HI> (except as a Me|dicin
or a <HI>Cordial</HI> on <HI>Extremities</HI>) is not
an In&s;titution of Nature, nor conducive to
<PB N="202" REF="218">
Health. That Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI> did not advi&s;e
<HI>&s;ole</HI> Water-drinking under her Medicin, but
rather directed the contrary, is no great
Wonder; it might have too much di&s;couraged
the U&s;e of a Medicin, nau&s;eous in it&s;elf, and
requir'd in large and frequent <HI>Do&s;es;</HI> and
that the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> that have been at mo&s;t
Pains to di&s;cover its Nature and Efficacy, have
&s;aid nothing for or again&s;t &s;ole Water <HI>Beve|rage</HI>
under it, might be for want of <HI>Ca&s;es,</HI>
where the Patients drank Water only under
it, to make the proper Experiments by. The
only Rea&s;on I have learn'd that is given for
drinking Wine under it, is that thereby the
<HI>Urine</HI> is render'd more <HI>Alcalin,</HI> and con&s;e|quently
more efficacious to work on the <HI>Stone:</HI>
But &s;urely this would be too frivolous for &s;uch
ingenious and penetrating Gentlemen to offer
as &s;olid, and &s;o could not come from them,
they well knowing, that <HI>fermented Men|&s;truums</HI>
rather de&s;troy than promote the <HI>Al|calin</HI>
Virtues of Medicins; for the &s;ame
Quantity of <HI>alcalious</HI> Matter, impregnating an
equal Quantity of an <HI>aqueous</HI> and a <HI>vinous
Men&s;truum,</HI> will render the fir&s;t much more
<HI>alcalin</HI> than the &s;econd. Fermented Liquors
harden and con&s;olidat the <HI>alcalin</HI> Particles, as
we may ob&s;erve from un&s;lak'd Lime, which
will be much &s;ooner and more fully broken
and di&s;&s;olv'd by a <HI>watery</HI> than by any fer|mented
<HI>Men&s;truum;</HI> and it is well known, that
Water is the &s;pecific Di&s;&s;olvent of all Salts. But
<PB N="203" REF="219">
that, in my Opinion, which &s;hould totally di&s;|courage
fermented Liquor Beverage under all
<HI>Lithontriptics,</HI> is, that it is univer&s;ally agreed,
that <HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel</HI> owe their Origin and
Cau&s;e &s;olely to the <HI>Tartar</HI> or <HI>Salts</HI> of fermented
Liquors, perhaps al&s;o to the <HI>animal Salts</HI>
of high Food, either in Parents or Po&s;terity;
and &s;urely the Medicin would work the quick|er
on the <HI>Stone,</HI> at lea&s;t have le&s;s to do, while
that which is the Cau&s;e of its Accretion were
intirely remov'd: And the Phy&s;ician <HI>Dolaeus,</HI>
tormented both with Gout and Stone, found
a Milk Diet the be&s;t Cure for both, and ad|vis'd
it equally in both<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Dolaeus</HI> on the Cure of the Gout by a Milk Diet.</NOTE>. <HI>Cyprianus,</HI> who
had cut fourteen hundred Patients for the
<HI>Stone,</HI> affirm'd, that among all tho&s;e there
was not <HI>one</HI> who drank any thing but &s;mall
&s;mooth Ale, or aqueous Liquors only. They
are &s;carce ever &s;ubject to it in the Ea&s;tern Coun|tries,
at lea&s;t the Natives, who drink little but
Water<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Kolben's</HI> Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Cape.</HI></NOTE>. I have had Patients under this
Medicin for the <HI>Stone,</HI> much tormented with
bloody Water, which Water-drinking only
has intirely &s;topp'd, except on violent Mo|tion;
and which, on the drinking the <HI>lea&s;t
Wine,</HI> has return'd, even without Motion. I
have known <HI>one,</HI> who, before Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s
Medicin was di&s;cover'd, was &s;o violently tor|mented
with the <HI>Stone,</HI> that he had &s;ent for
<PB N="204" REF="220">
Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI> to cut him, who finding him
under &s;o bad a Habit, dur&s;t not attempt the
Operation, but advis'd him to a low, cool,
&s;oft Regimen, and Barley-water-drinking, to
mend his Con&s;titution; whereby he &s;oon be|came
&s;o ea&s;y in &s;ome time, that he thought
no more of that painful and dangerous Ope|ration.
In a Word, it is my Opinion, in
this, as I certainly know in all other pain|ful
and dangerous <HI>Chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers, that
&s;ole Water or unfermented Liquor <HI>Beve|rage,</HI>
under their proper medicinal <HI>Antidots,</HI>
would much quicken and facilitat the Cure:
In &s;lighter and le&s;s atrocious Di&s;tempers, I can
allow a little <HI>compounding</HI> the Matter, be|tween
<HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> Pain and <HI>&s;en&s;ual</HI> Plea&s;ure, I
&s;ay, in other milder Ca&s;es; but in the <HI>Stone</HI>
and <HI>Gout,</HI> I &s;hould think, would not admit
even this, becau&s;e here the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;|temper
is increas'd and enrag'd by this fatal
Indulgence.</P>

<P>&sect;. 1. SOME have objected, that by thus
&s;trongly pre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Lighte&s;t</HI> and
the <HI>Lea&s;t,</HI> and confidently affirming, that <HI>Tem|perance</HI>
and <HI>Ab&s;tinence</HI> have but one <HI>Extreme,</HI>
the <HI>Too-high</HI> or <HI>Too-much</HI> in Food, I may
&s;eem to in&s;inuat, that a <HI>total Ab&s;tinence</HI> may
be the very be&s;t of all; or to think, that none
ever hurt his <HI>Health</HI> by any Degree of Ab&s;ti|nence
what&s;oever. And yet it is a well|known
<HI>Fact,</HI> that many have actually died by
an ob&s;tinat Re&s;olution to take no Nouri&s;h|ment;
and that from &s;ome violent Pa&s;&s;ion, as
<HI>Love</HI> or <HI>Grief, Revenge</HI> or <HI>Di&s;content,</HI> &s;ome
have pin'd away, and put an End to their Days;
<PB N="208" REF="224">
that by an ob&s;tinat Neglect of due and proper
Nouri&s;hment, the dige&s;tive <HI>Organs</HI> have in
time acquir'd an <HI>analeptic</HI> or <HI>paralytic</HI> State,
that they actually could dige&s;t nothing; or that
by long Fa&s;ting and Ab&s;tinence, the concoct|ing
<HI>Ferment</HI> or Juice in the <HI>Stomach</HI> and

the Juices, and caus'd <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> and at la&s;t
<HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 2. THE Whole of this <HI>Objection,</HI> and
&s;uch-like, is mere vulgar Error, frivolous, and
<HI>unphilo&s;ophical.</HI> I am here inquireing what is
the <HI>Law</HI> of Nature in Diet, not by what
Cunning or Craft this <HI>Law</HI> may be eluded.
The <HI>Author</HI> of Nature declares his <HI>Will,</HI> his
<HI>Laws,</HI> his Orders in material or natural
Things, in the animal <HI>Oeconomy</HI> particularly,
by general Effects differing in certain Propor|tions,
according to different Circum&s;tances;
by placing us as it were between two <HI>parallel
Walls,</HI> and <HI>barring</HI> us up either before or be|hind;
and &s;o it is then evidently his <HI>Law</HI> and
Order, that we &s;hould only go backward or
forward, as the <HI>Bar</HI> happens to be put. He
has put <HI>Valves</HI> or Stops in the <HI>Arteries</HI> that
<HI>open</HI> towards the Surface of the Body, and
<HI>&s;hut</HI> towards the Heart; and therefore I &s;ay it
is his Law and Order, intimated by <HI>them,</HI>
that the Blood &s;hould move forward towards
the Surface of the Body, and not backward
<PB N="209" REF="225">
to the Heart even in all <HI>Animals,</HI> (yet I know
not, but by great <HI>Intemperance</HI> in &s;trong Li|quors,
even the&s;e <HI>Valves</HI> are &s;ometimes forc'd,
and the Blood, by regorging on the Ven|tricles
of the <HI>Heart,</HI> may there clott and
harden, and thereby becomes the natural Cau&s;e
of <HI>Polypus</HI>'s) but it is not &s;o in the <HI>Veins.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 3. WHEN I &s;ay, that contrary to the
Nature of &s;ome other <HI>moral</HI> Virtues, (who&s;e
Perfection lies in the <HI>Middle</HI> between both
<HI>Extremes</HI>) <HI>Ab&s;tinence</HI> has but one <HI>Extreme,</HI>
the <HI>Too-much</HI> or <HI>Too-high</HI> in Food, I mean
only, by a <HI>&s;trong Figure,</HI> to take off the crafty
<HI>Puzzle</HI> thrown in by &s;ome, that Per&s;ons may
hurt their Healths, and endanger their Lives, by,
&s;ay they, an ill-judg'd <HI>Ab&s;tinence.</HI> The wi&s;e
<HI>Author</HI> of Nature has barr'd up the <HI>Too-little</HI> or
<HI>Too-light,</HI> with Pains and Sufferings &s;o inten&s;e
and excruciating, as &s;trongly declare, that it
is not his <HI>Law</HI> and Order, that we &s;hould per|&s;i&s;t
ob&s;tinatly in them, but de&s;cend into that
middling Quantity we are tolerably ea&s;y un|der.
It is true, he has al&s;o barr'd up the <HI>Too-high</HI>
and <HI>Too-much</HI> with Pains and Penalties,
but they are neither &s;o inten&s;e, nor &s;o quick|ly
fatal. The <HI>Too-much</HI> and <HI>Too-high</HI> will
produce Di&s;ea&s;es in Proportion to their <HI>De|grees</HI>
directly, but they neither kill &s;o &s;oon,
nor torture &s;o much, as ob&s;tinat <HI>Fa&s;cing</HI> will,
if it be po&s;&s;ible to per&s;i&s;t in it naturally. It
is certain, that <HI>Self-pre&s;ervation</HI> is an e&s;&s;ential
<PB N="210" REF="226">
LAW of Nature; and yet from <HI>Fren&s;y</HI> and
&s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions, we hear of its being defeated
daily. We judge of the Nature, <HI>Tribe</HI> and
Species of a <HI>Plant</HI> or <HI>Animal,</HI> by the faire&s;t
and be&s;t, and not by <HI>mon&s;trous</HI> or accidental
Productions in either <HI>Extreme;</HI> as this Death
by Fa&s;ting implies a direct <HI>Mon&s;truo&s;ity.</HI></P>

and the <HI>Lea&s;t,</HI> I mean, To take regularly
Something and Somewhat; for Nothing nei|ther
admits of Degrees nor Qualities. Sup|po&s;e
(to &s;hew the Ab&s;urdity) a Man took
<HI>half a Pound</HI> of Bread and a <HI>Pint</HI> of Water
three times a Day, what would be the Con|&s;equence?
The <HI>Objector</HI> thinks the Patient
would certainly <HI>die;</HI> his concocting Juices
would turn <HI>acrid,</HI> and &s;o &s;poil his Blood, and
thereby he would <HI>pine,</HI> and at la&s;t extingui&s;h;
and yet <HI>Ca&s;&s;ian</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Ca&s;&s;ian's <HI>Conferences.</HI></NOTE> tells us, that the antient <HI>Her|mits</HI>

Hours; and mo&s;t of them liv'd to an <HI>Hun|dred,</HI>
&s;ome to an Hundred and Fifty, others to
Two hundred Years, without Di&s;ea&s;es, and
with great Serenity and Chearfulne&s;s. And

the material <HI>Organs</HI> belonging to them, mu&s;t

own private Opinion, it is, that where-ever
the&s;e violent <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>Love,
Grief, Revenge,</HI> or Di&s;content, happen to
&s;uch a Height, there is a deep <HI>Cacochymy</HI>
there already; that the Juices are already in|flamed
or putrified, <HI>acrimonious</HI> or <HI>ar&s;enic,</HI>
and that the Solids and intellectual <HI>Organs</HI>
are &s;poiled, relaxed or putrified, and di&s;obe|dient

<HI>morbid</HI> Trees; but at lea&s;t the Spirit, as well
as the Body, mu&s;t fir&s;t be greatly di&s;temper'd.
But the&s;e la&s;t Solutions may be mere Conjec|tures,

<P>&sect;. 6. BUT the mo&s;t whim&s;ical and unphi|lo&s;ophical
Part of this Objection, is, that the
<HI>Archaeus,</HI> as &s;ome term it, or (which is the
&s;ame thing) the inexplicable <HI>Ferment,</HI> in the
<HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Glands,</HI> turning <HI>acrid</HI> and <HI>ar|&s;enic</HI>
by Fa&s;ting, corrupts the Blood, and &s;o
cau&s;es Di&s;ea&s;es and Death; which is merely
to &s;ub&s;titute <HI>&s;omething</HI> or <HI>any thing</HI> to &s;upply
the Void Ignorance has made, and thus <HI>every
thing</HI> may be concluded from <HI>any thing.</HI>
The true <HI>Fact,</HI> I think, is this: The wi&s;e
<HI>Author</HI> of Nature has, by his own omni|potent
Hand, originally and primarily form'd
the <HI>infinite&s;imal Solids</HI> of all <HI>Plants</HI> and
<HI>Animals;</HI> neither lifele&s;s Nature, nor Mat|ter
and Mechani&s;m, with all its Laws, be|ing
capable to frame the lea&s;t original <HI>Or|gan</HI>
or <HI>Fibre</HI> of either, as may be &s;trictly de|mon&s;trated.
It is certain from the Expences
<PB N="213" REF="229">
of Living, Action, and the Secretions, the
Blood, but e&s;pecially the new Bile, if not re|cruited,
diluted and cool'd, with fre&s;h <HI>Chyle,</HI>
and aqueous Fluids, in &s;ome Degree, would
turn hot, vi&s;cous and thick, and &s;o produce
Di&s;ea&s;es of all kinds; but then Water-gruel,
Milk, and Garden-&s;tuff, would be the very
be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual to prevent all the&s;e
Inconveniencies, and keep it always cool,
&s;weet, and fluid; and of the&s;e there is no Mea|&s;ure
needs be put, but by Calls of the Appe|tite,
unle&s;s the Party be ill and di&s;eas'd: For,
by a nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> the animal <HI>Fibres</HI>
and <HI>Tubes</HI> are &s;et a playing, to take in Nou|ri&s;hment,
and Materials for <HI>Accretion, Evo|lution,</HI>
and <HI>Exten&s;ion,</HI> from any Fluid or
Juice next to them, whether good, bad, or
indifferent; and thus grow and extend, as far
as their original <HI>Stamina</HI> admit; after which
they harden, fix and &s;top, the Juices thicken,
and the <HI>Vegetable</HI> or <HI>Animal</HI> naturally and
nece&s;&s;arily dies, and turns into Du&s;t: And this
is all that <HI>dige&s;tive</HI> or concoctive Powers can
do; they can only &s;uck in by their <HI>attractive</HI>
Powers, and by their <HI>mechanic</HI> Powers grind
and comminute the Materials neare&s;t the Ori|fices
of their <HI>Lacteals</HI> and <HI>Va&s;a inhalantia,</HI>
to fit them to plump up and extend the&s;e
original <HI>linear Solids,</HI> till they arrive at their
utmo&s;t Exten&s;ion and Growth; and this they
will do from their own <HI>inherent</HI> original
<HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> and <HI>Attraction,</HI> directed by the
<PB N="214" REF="230">
Action and Influence of the <HI>immaterial &s;elf-motive
Spirit,</HI> that governs and moves all

&s;o that, like the <HI>Root</HI> of a <HI>Plant,</HI> the
<HI>Animal</HI> is fed or nouri&s;h'd by a watery
Mucilage, or the neare&s;t fluid Mixture, what|ever
that be; as is evident from hence,
that our Bodies may be fed and &s;u&s;tain'd
by <HI>Cly&s;ters, Fomentations, Injections, Tran&s;|fu&s;ions,</HI>
and even <HI>Steams</HI> and Vapours, as
really, though not &s;o fully and dureably, as
by the Mouth and dige&s;tive <HI>Organs,</HI> without
any <HI>Archaeus</HI> or <HI>Ferment.</HI> All depends on
the original <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> and <HI>Attraction</HI> of the
Solids, and the Direction and Superintendence
of the <HI>immaterial</HI> indwelling <HI>Spirit;</HI> and any
fluid Mixture will do, that lies neare&s;t; but
what will mo&s;t ea&s;ily grind and divide, is
fitte&s;t and be&s;t. It is true, as has been &s;aid,
to keep the Blood cool and thin, and to have
the Health the be&s;t it may be, regular Supplies
of fre&s;h <HI>Chyle</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary; but <HI>Water, Milk,
Seeds, Fruit</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> will do that
be&s;t of any.</P>
<P>&sect;. 7. ONE favourite and &s;pecious <HI>Objection,</HI>
made by &s;ome <HI>unphilo&s;ophical</HI> Per&s;ons, again&s;t
a low, cool <HI>Diet,</HI> is the Danger thereby from
the over-abounding either of the too <HI>alcalious,</HI>
too &s;weet and &s;oft Juices, or the too <HI>&s;harp</HI>
and &s;our ones; <HI>one</HI> or <HI>other</HI> of which, they
&s;ay, Seeds and Vegetables may produce, and
<PB N="215" REF="231">
into one of which, in their Opinion, they are
naturally apt to run; at fir&s;t into the <HI>Too-&s;weet,</HI>
and at la&s;t <HI>Too-&s;harp,</HI> and both in their Turns.
But the Experiments a&s;&s;ign'd for Proof of
this Objection are far from being deci&s;ive of
the true Cau&s;e in the Ca&s;es objected, <HI>viz.</HI> that
&s;uch and &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es are relieved or cured
by <HI>Acids,</HI> or <HI>alcalious</HI> Medicins <HI>re&s;pectively,</HI>
becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, Acids in the Air, and in
the Mixture of <HI>chymical</HI> Liquors, de&s;troy <HI>Al|kali's,</HI>
and on the contrary. Now I would
de&s;ire tho&s;e Gentlemen to con&s;ider, 1&deg;. That
there is no manner of Certainty, that <HI>Acids,</HI>
or <HI>alcaline Salts,</HI> can operate in the <HI>capillary</HI>
Ve&s;&s;els of living animal Bodies, after the &s;ame
manner as they do in the open Air, and at
perfect Liberty; becau&s;e their Operation is and
mu&s;t be ob&s;tructed, or much altered, by the
<HI>attracting</HI> Sides of the &s;lender <HI>Tubes,</HI> (as
we &s;ee in <HI>Mercury</HI> and Water in &s;mall gla&s;s
<HI>Tubes</HI>) and by the con&s;tant Motion of the
Particles of <HI>animal</HI> Fluids in the <HI>Circulation;</HI>
whereas <HI>Re&s;t</HI> is an indi&s;pen&s;able <HI>Condition</HI>
towards the free and full <HI>Action</HI> of the innate
Laws, and the Properties of <HI>minute</HI> Bo|dies.
2&deg;. It is a great Doubt with me,
whether there be in Nature, antecedent to
the <HI>Tortures</HI> of the <HI>Fire,</HI> (natural or ar|tificial)
any true, at lea&s;t perfect <HI>Alcali's.</HI>
I am &s;ure the Appearances (<HI>viz.</HI> their <HI>Fer|mentation</HI>
with <HI>Acids</HI>) may be more <HI>philo|&s;ophically</HI>
accounted for otherwi&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="216" REF="232">
from their <HI>&s;pecific</HI> Gravity and <HI>Attraction,</HI>
which are certainly their mo&s;t <HI>active</HI> Prin|ciples,
and likelie&s;t to produce the <HI>Appear|ances</HI>
under Con&s;ideration: And the <HI>Figures</HI>
of the two different Kinds of Particles mu&s;t
greatly partake in the Effect, <HI>viz.</HI> from the
<HI>Particles</HI> of the <HI>Acids</HI> being probably <HI>train|gular,</HI>
and highly <HI>attractive,</HI> and tho&s;e of
<HI>Alkali's</HI> being porous <HI>Calx's,</HI> whereby the
&s;harp Points of the Acids will be &s;heathed
or blunted in the Pores of the <HI>Alkali's;</HI> for
though Nature, by the &s;imple&s;t Cau&s;es, pro|duces
various and &s;urpri&s;ing Effects, yet the
infinitly wi&s;e <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> being here
confined by the <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of that Matter, which
he has made, to &s;ome <HI>Figure</HI> in&s;eparable even
from the lea&s;t Particles of Matter, no doubt
would chu&s;e the fitte&s;t, of which the&s;e two
mentioned &s;eem the be&s;t contrived. 3&deg;. I
could never conceive, that Health and the
Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es (being &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Quali|fication
for all the wi&s;e Ends and Purpo&s;es; for
which an <HI>infinitly wi&s;e Being</HI> could &s;end his
<HI>Creatures</HI> hither) could ever make them depend
upon the Subtleties and Dreams of <HI>Pyrotech|nical
Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> or the Tortures of <HI>Chy|mical</HI>
Fires. I allow <HI>Chymi&s;try</HI> one of the
fitte&s;t and noble&s;t <HI>In&s;truments</HI> to di&s;cover
<HI>analytically</HI> the Nature, internal Compo&s;ition,
the <HI>Laws, Size,</HI> and <HI>Figures,</HI> of the com|ponent
Particles of Bodies, as far as it can
go; and &s;o to be of noble U&s;e in <HI>Natural
<PB N="217" REF="233">
Philo&s;ophy:</HI> But for <HI>Medicin,</HI> and the <HI>Cure</HI>
of bodily Di&s;tempers, there is &s;carce a valu|able
Compo&s;ition di&s;covered by <HI>Chymi&s;ts,</HI>
that by long Experience and Ob&s;ervation, I
could <HI>prefer</HI> or equal to the &s;imple Products
of Nature, when judiciou&s;ly and experiment|ally
cho&s;en and treated. But, 4&deg;. The true
Cau&s;e of the Di&s;tempers here &s;aid to be pro|duced
by the <HI>alcalious</HI> State of the Juices,
and cured by <HI>Acids,</HI> and on the contrary; was
the tender <HI>Cra&s;e</HI> of the too vi&s;cid Blood and
Juices, produced by the <HI>Too-much</HI> of Food,
<HI>viz.</HI> by more than the Wa&s;tes of Living, or
the Expences of the natural Functions, re|quired;
<HI>Acids</HI> then, by con&s;tringing and vel|licating
the Solids, (which is their natural
and nece&s;&s;ary Effect) increa&s;ing their <HI>Spring</HI>
and Action, (as we wind up the <HI>Spring</HI>
of a <HI>Watch</HI> to make it go fa&s;ter) and &s;o
accelerating the natural <HI>Functions,</HI> whereby
greater Di&s;charges were made, and all the
<HI>Dige&s;tions</HI> (fir&s;t and &s;econd) became more
perfect; rendered the Juices more fluid, and
the Functions more ea&s;y and natural. But
I even doubt of the <HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Cures</HI> al|leged
in this Objection; for Nature often
<HI>&s;aves</HI> and cures in time, when Art can|not
kill. But I think the whole Doctrine of
<HI>Acids</HI> and <HI>Alcali's</HI> in the <HI>medical Aetiology,</HI>
a mere <HI>Pyrotechnical</HI> Romance, e&s;pecially in
the Cau&s;e and Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es without the

Bounds of the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> as the ingenious

<P>&sect;. 8. ANOTHER great Complaint again&s;t
a <HI>low Diet, vegetable</HI> Food, Milk and Milk-meats,
and all Legums, Herbs and Fruits, is,
that in the&s;e our <HI>Northern</HI> Climats they are
windy, flatulent and tumifying, creating in|&s;upportable
<HI>Hurricanes</HI> and Convul&s;ions in
the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Bowels</HI> of &s;ome Per&s;ons. I
grant that where the Stomach is hot and in|flamed
by <HI>high</HI> Meats and Drinks, and the
Bowels loaded with <HI>Choler, Phlegm,</HI> and
<HI>Wind,</HI> the&s;e <HI>Symptoms</HI> indeed at fir&s;t may
happen; but that is only from the former
<HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>Mal-Regimen.</HI> No Food can be
had on the Globe without Wind, that is,
without <HI>ela&s;tic</HI> or <HI>unela&s;tic, i. e.</HI> fixed <HI>Air,</HI>
&s;hut up and inclos'd in its Sub&s;tance; <HI>Air</HI> be|ing
a Part of its original Compo&s;ition. In
&s;ound Bodies, and clean Con&s;titutions, this
<HI>Air</HI> is evaporated and thrown off by the Per|&s;piration;
for which End that Infinity of <HI>per|&s;piratory
Ducts</HI> all over the internal and ex|ternal
Surface of the Body is de&s;ign'd; &s;o
when the Body is in a good State, and tho&s;e
<HI>Ducts</HI> are <HI>pervious,</HI> when the Dige&s;tions are
good, and the Food &s;ufficiently <HI>ground</HI> and
comminuted, and the <HI>Wind</HI> &s;et free, it pa&s;&s;es
without the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible Ob&s;ervation, Trouble
or Inconveniency, by <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI> like
<PB N="219" REF="235">
Smoak out of a <HI>Chimney;</HI> but when the Food
is but <HI>gro&s;ly</HI> dige&s;ted, and the <HI>per&s;piratory
Ducts</HI> &s;topp'd by the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of its <HI>Par|ticles,</HI>
then the included <HI>Air</HI> is long retained
and accumulated in the Body, as by a foul
<HI>Chimney</HI> the Room is choaked with <HI>Smoak;</HI>
and this is the true Ca&s;e in mo&s;t <HI>chronical</HI> and
all <HI>nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers. But then there is a
great Difference between the Pain ari&s;ing from
the <HI>Windine&s;s</HI> of <HI>high animal</HI> Food, and <HI>&s;trong</HI>
Liquors, the <HI>Torture, Panic</HI> and <HI>Convul&s;ions</HI>
they produce at la&s;t, and the <HI>Wind</HI> of <HI>vege|table</HI>
Food, as is between a freezing <HI>North-ea&s;t
Wind,</HI> and a warm <HI>We&s;tern Breeze;</HI> the
fir&s;t being compo&s;ed of pointed <HI>animal Salts,</HI>
and burning <HI>Oils</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> and the la&s;t
only of cool &s;imple Air, Earth and Wa|ter.
But in the&s;e la&s;t, the <HI>Windine&s;s</HI> and
<HI>Flatulency</HI> may be greatly le&s;&s;ened by <HI>much</HI>
and <HI>well</HI> boiling or bakeing; culinary Heat,
in all In&s;tances, when judiciou&s;ly applied,
having the &s;ame Effect as the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI>
as is evident from <HI>infinit Experiments;</HI> and
the Parts of <HI>Vegetables</HI> being more ea&s;ily di&s;|&s;olved
and divided into their <HI>integral Par|ticles,</HI>
the <HI>pre&s;piratory</HI> and flatulent Sub|&s;tance
will more ea&s;ily pa&s;s through them,
Boiled <HI>Milk,</HI> and ground <HI>Seeds,</HI> are not &s;ub|jected
to this Incommodity, and roa&s;ted Fruits
very little. But indeed the <HI>Objection</HI> will
only take place at <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> when the <HI>Luxurio$$</HI>
are but ju&s;t changing their <HI>Regimen,</HI> or are
<PB N="220" REF="236">
grown old. A little Patience and Per&s;everance
in the Endeavour after the <HI>Lighte&s;t</HI> and the
<HI>Lea&s;t</HI> will fully an&s;wer this <HI>Objection:</HI> But a
<HI>vegetable</HI> Diet is what I never recommend,
but in very bad Ca&s;es, and when Water-drink|ing
under an <HI>animal</HI> Diet has not been able
to make a Cure, nor greatly to relieve, and
that even under this Re&s;triction the Patient
continues extremely mi&s;erable: Tho', I think,
Milk and Seeds, in all Ca&s;es, will do all that
Art can.</P>

&s;een &s;ome In&s;tances, of which a few have

Diet, and Food not fitted to the Con&s;titution

of Fact and Truth is, when the <HI>Glands</HI>

are greatly corrupted and &s;poiled by a <HI>Vi&s;|cidity</HI>

they can get down of <HI>poignant</HI> Food, that
Nature had provided many <HI>Out-lets</HI> and Pa&s;|&s;ages

this <HI>Fact</HI> of the Indulgence of the

Truth of the Matter is ju&s;t the <HI>Rever&s;e: Na|ture</HI>

both in &s;trong, rank <HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fer|mented</HI>

of the <HI>Fire;</HI> that there have been &s;uch
<HI>thoughtle&s;s Mortals,</HI> I will not deny: But
<PB N="228" REF="244">
&s;uch In&s;tances are of no more Weight again&s;t
what I advance, <HI>viz.</HI> that the &s;horte&s;t and
mo&s;t infallible Means to prolong Life, to pre|&s;erve
Health, <HI>Freedom</HI> from Di&s;ea&s;es, and <HI>Free|dom</HI>
of Spirits, is to take down con&s;tantly the
<HI>Lighte&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Lea&s;t</HI> Food a Man can be
ea&s;y under, or a con&s;tant Endeavour after the
<HI>Too-little;</HI> than the <HI>Life</HI> of an <HI>Elephant</HI> or
<HI>Roebuck</HI> (&s;ome of which have been &s;aid to
live Four, Five, or Six hundred Years) is longer
than that of a <HI>Lap-dog;</HI> or that the Lives of
the <HI>Antediluvians</HI> were longer than <HI>ours.</HI> The
<HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> the <HI>Art,</HI> and <HI>Perfection</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI>
is to make a Man live chearful and ea&s;y,
without Pain or Di&s;ea&s;e, with the U&s;e of his
<HI>Sen&s;es</HI> and <HI>Faculties,</HI> and at la&s;t di&s;&s;olve with|out
lingering Pain, when he has lived as long
as <HI>Nature</HI> fram'd him to la&s;t. <HI>London Hou&s;es</HI>
are made to la&s;t Fifty Years, <HI>Country Hou&s;es</HI>
for Five hundred. With &s;ome the common
way of dealing with their <HI>Patients,</HI> is con&s;tant|ly
to blow the Fire, as with a Pair of <HI>Smith's
Bellows,</HI> till they blow it <HI>out,</HI> or in a few
Bla&s;ts con&s;ume it to <HI>A&s;hes.</HI> The <HI>Method</HI> I
would in&s;inuat, is to take out the <HI>A&s;hes,</HI> and
<HI>dead Coals,</HI> keep it open, and give it Air;
and then it will <HI>burn</HI> chearfully as long as the
Nature of the <HI>Materials</HI> will allow. One
long-liv'd <HI>Glutton</HI> or <HI>Drunkard</HI> kills more
by his Example, and the flattering Hopes, tho&s;e
who know not their own Strength, and what
<PB N="229" REF="245">
they were made to bear, entertain, than <HI>Hip|pocrates</HI>

<P>&sect;. 14. ANOTHER great and formidable
<HI>Puzzle</HI> again&s;t a <HI>low</HI> Diet, in the <HI>Gout</HI> e&s;pe|cially,
is, that &s;ome have grown wor&s;e under
it, and have been ever after declining; and
&s;ome have actually died, after they had enter'd
into this <HI>Regimen;</HI> and therefore &s;ome weak
Dealers in <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> rail again&s;t it, pretending
Experience and Ob&s;ervation for their Ju&s;tifi|cation.
I would ask the&s;e <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Is it
from the Nature and <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of the <HI>Diet</HI> that
this Misfortune happen'd? This they will not
care to &s;ay, &s;ince <HI>nine</HI> Parts in <HI>ten</HI> of the
Ma&s;s of Mankind, who follow this Diet, do
well, and are free from the <HI>Gout.</HI> Is it then
from the Nature of the Di&s;temper? This
they dare not &s;ay neither; for a low <HI>Diet</HI> is
the proper <HI>Antidot</HI> to Inflammation, in which
the <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of the <HI>Gout</HI> con&s;i&s;ts. Nay, but,
&s;ay they, the <HI>Inflammation</HI> of the <HI>Gout</HI> is on
the Limbs and Extremities, and a cool Diet
will draw it upon the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> and <HI>noble Parts.</HI>
Allowing this its whole <HI>Force,</HI> it is only an
Argument for warmer and more generous
Medicins while the <HI>Fit</HI> la&s;ts; and it is in the
Intervals that a <HI>low Diet</HI> is chiefly recom|mended
to le&s;&s;en the future <HI>Inflammation;</HI>
and after all, I much doubt, even when it is
on the Extremities, if the <HI>Diet</HI> ought not to
be low and cool; only the Solids and dige&s;|tive
<PB N="230" REF="246">
Organs are to be gently and temperatly
braced and corroborated, to keep the <HI>Inflam|mation</HI>
on the Extremity, which vegetable
Bracers and A&s;tringents will do. But the
lower the Diet is, the &s;afer: Give <HI>Re&s;t</HI> to a
broken Leg after it is &s;et, it will cure it&s;elf;
give the <HI>Stomach</HI> little or nothing to do in the
Affair of Dige&s;tion, (which is its proper Ac|tion)
and it will mend it&s;elf. In gro&s;s foul
Habits, and putrified Juices, great Di&s;orders
have en&s;ued on a <HI>low Diet;</HI> but that was
from a <HI>De&s;pumation</HI> of the Habit: And I
am convinced, whatever the&s;e &s;uffer from a
<HI>low Diet,</HI> would be doubled without it; and
he who dies under it, would have died in
half the Time, and &s;uffer'd double the Mi|&s;ery,
without it: Nothing but putrefied <HI>Or|gans,</HI>
and greatly corrupted Juices, can de|&s;troy
&s;uch a Per&s;on. When Life is far ad|vanced,
no wi&s;e Man ought to change any
thing in his <HI>Regimen,</HI> but the Quantity.</P>
<P>&sect;. 15. SOME ingenious Gentlemen have
&s;aid or &s;neer'd, For him, (the Author) who
is as robu&s;t as an <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> or an <HI>Elephant,</HI> a
vegetable Diet may be proper; but for
poor <HI>tender, vapouri&s;h,</HI> and <HI>nervous</HI> Crea|tures,
it is Poi&s;on, Death and De&s;truc|tion.
Such Objections I &s;hould be a&s;ham'd
to an&s;wer, if I did not know they came
even from Per&s;ons of <HI>Character,</HI> and reputed
<HI>Eminence</HI> in the Profe&s;&s;ion; and yet it is
<PB N="231" REF="247">
wrong, and even frivolous, in every Part.
As for <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> I have been all my Life of a
<HI>&s;pongy, flabby, relax'd</HI> Habit, of weak <HI>Nerves</HI>
originally, ea&s;ily ruffled, &s;urpri&s;ed and hur|ried,
and thereupon readily running into Eva|cuations
of all kinds, which infallibly indicat
weak <HI>Nerves;</HI> and the&s;e Symptoms have
been increas'd by a lazy Di&s;po&s;ition, and
heighten'd by a <HI>Mal-Regimen,</HI> and <HI>&s;edentary</HI>
ab&s;tracted Studies. And as to the Founda|tion
of the Objection it&s;elf, it is <HI>frivolous.</HI>
For if a &s;trong robu&s;t Body, originally or by
a mi&s;taken <HI>Regimen,</HI> comes to have putrify|ing
Juices, and broken or relax'd Solids, and
yet by a low Diet, and <HI>ponderous</HI> Medicins,
can recover a &s;ound Con&s;titution, and good
Spirits; &s;uch a Diet will be infinitly more
nece&s;&s;ary for a poor weak <HI>nervous</HI> Creature:
The fir&s;t may &s;truggle and hold it out a great
while by his natural Force; but the latter
mu&s;t be extremely mi&s;erable, or peri&s;h &s;oon,
without it. In Rea&s;on and Philo&s;ophy, the
Food ought to bear a Proportion both in
<HI>Quantity</HI> and <HI>Quality</HI> to the natural Strength,
Bulk and Capaciou&s;ne&s;s of the Subject; and
on that Score, if a large, &s;trong and capacious
Subject cannot be cured without a low, cool
and &s;pare Diet; much le&s;s, &s;ure, can a poor,
thin, &s;mall and weakly Creature be cured
without it in a proportional Degree. The
Objection is, ju&s;t as if one &s;hould aver, that
though a <HI>Kite</HI> or <HI>Carrion-Crow</HI> might live
<PB N="232" REF="248">
active and gay on a low Diet, yet it would
de&s;troy a <HI>Nightingale</HI> or <HI>Wren.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 16. THERE are In&s;tances alleg'd, of
tho&s;e who after having been long under a <HI>low
Diet,</HI> even of Milk and Vegetables, with|out
being quite recover'd, nay, even &s;till con|tinuing
bad under it, upon returning to a
<HI>full high Diet,</HI> (at lea&s;t a common Diet
of <HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fermented Liquors</HI>)
have got perfectly well; and &s;ome (&s;uch as
I have formerly taken Notice of) that having
chang'd their low Diet upon &s;ome <HI>acci|dental</HI>
or <HI>epidemical</HI> Di&s;temper happening
to them, or by the Advice of &s;ome <HI>com|plai&s;ant
Foreigner,</HI> have afterwards grown
tolerably well. All I can &s;ay to the&s;e is, that
very po&s;&s;ibly a <HI>low Diet</HI> might be pre|&s;crib'd
where it was not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary,
nor in all Circum&s;tances the fitte&s;t (as to
<HI>tho&s;e</HI> well otherwi&s;e, but &s;unk, <HI>emaciated,</HI>
and their Juices render'd poor and <HI>effete,</HI>
by violent <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> ill-judg'd <HI>Fa&s;teing</HI> and
Ab&s;tinence, or violent <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI>). And yet
I know, or can po&s;&s;ibly imagine, but one <HI>Cir|cum&s;tance</HI>
where this can be the Ca&s;e; <HI>viz.</HI>
when upon opening a Vein with a large
Orifice, the <HI>Curd</HI> of the Blood has appear'd
florid, &s;ufficiently fluid, with a right-colour'd
and duely proportion'd <HI>Serum;</HI> but this
<HI>Grume</HI> or <HI>Curd</HI> has been weak, poor and thin,
without a &s;ufficient Body and Bal&s;am, and
<PB N="233" REF="249">
the <HI>Serum</HI> too watery and <HI>pellucid.</HI> Some
&s;uch Ca&s;es have occurr'd to me, where I al|ways
advis'd a <HI>trimming</HI> or even a common
Diet of <HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors,
in Moderation, to be gradually enter'd upon
to thicken and balmify the Juices; and it has
&s;ucceeded accordingly. But as this Ca&s;e
&s;eldom or never happens, but from a prece|dent
too long Continuance of a <HI>low</HI> Diet, or
the Circum&s;tances above recited, or from a too
anxious and ill-judg'd Pro&s;ecution of the <HI>Light|e&s;t</HI>
and the <HI>Lea&s;t;</HI> &s;o it is certain, if &s;uch Per|&s;ons
had gone on in the &s;ame Method of a low
Diet with <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> they would have been
perfectly and dureably well at la&s;t, and the
<HI>Grume</HI> of the Blood would in Time have
thicken'd and &s;trengthen'd even by the <HI>&s;ame</HI>
Diet; for Nature will at la&s;t ever have its
Due: But by Rea&s;on of their Fears and Ap|prehen&s;ions,
and their De&s;ire of being &s;oon
better, being allow'd and incourag'd to a
higher and fuller Diet, they have thereby
&s;ooner inrich'd and &s;trengthen'd their Blood
and Juices, and acquir'd <HI>high Health</HI> for &s;ome
time; but have ever paid for this <HI>lucid In|terval,</HI>
by <HI>&s;hortening</HI> their Days, and dying in
more <HI>Mi&s;ery.</HI> And therefore, with due Caution,
I have &s;ometimes indulg'd &s;uch Per&s;ons for
the <HI>Hardne&s;s</HI> of their <HI>Hearts;</HI> and they have
gone on in common Life very well, which
has been only owing to the balmifying, cool|ing
and attenuating <HI>Regimen</HI> they had been
<PB N="234" REF="250">
&s;o long in formerly. But this has happen'd
only to the <HI>Young,</HI> and to tho&s;e who were
under or only about the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life,
who having naturally a long time as yet to
live, could not be expected to have &s;o much
Steadine&s;s and Re&s;olution as to per&s;evere in
&s;o particular and uncommon a <HI>Regimen;</HI> and
therefore I thought it not Prudence to put
their Virtue and Courage to &s;uch a <HI>Trial,</HI> but
brought them out of this <HI>low Diet</HI> by De|grees
with Caution, and with Advice to re|turn
to it upon the &s;lighte&s;t per&s;evering Ails.
Tho&s;e long pa&s;t the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life, I have
never &s;uffer'd to change. From this Account
of the Ca&s;e, it is plain the future Health
injoy'd was not owing to the Change of a
<HI>lower</HI> for a <HI>higher</HI> Diet, as the Objectors
would in&s;inuat, but to the Benefit already
receiv'd by the low Diet, and its having
thinn'd the Juices, cleans'd the <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> and
empty'd the Ve&s;&s;els, and thereby render'd
them capable to receive a fuller and &s;tronger
Diet, and hold well for a time; though it is
certain they had lived longer and healthier
at la&s;t, and died with le&s;s Pain, had they con|tinued
their Diet. But I much doubt the <HI>Fact,</HI>
on which the Objection is founded; for <HI>Na|ture</HI>
is never &s;o irregular and di&s;&s;onant to her|&s;elf,
as this Objection &s;uppo&s;es.</P>
<P>&sect;. 17. THERE is not a more puzzling and

and incorporated with the whole Habit, and
tran&s;ub&s;tantiated into the Solids; the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI>
may be &s;o ob&s;tructed and &s;poil'd, the Blood
and Juices &s;o <HI>vi&s;cid</HI> and <HI>morbid,</HI> that even
the new, &s;weet, bal&s;amic <HI>Chyle</HI> may not mix,
a&s;&s;imilat, and incorporat with the old Ma&s;s,
&s;o as to make an <HI>homogenous</HI> Fluid, (at lea&s;t
not in any &s;mall Time) to <HI>nouri&s;h, plump</HI> up,
and carry on the <HI>Circulation</HI> to the Extre|mities,
and <HI>capillary Arteries</HI> and <HI>Veins,</HI>
whence lively Colour, Complexion, and
<HI>Plumping</HI> ari&s;e; and this may cau&s;e an
univer&s;al Wa&s;teing, till the Blood and
Juices be &s;ufficiently thinn'd and balmify'd,
and acquire its <HI>&s;carlet</HI> Colour, and the <HI>Ob|&s;tructions</HI>

of the <HI>Capillaries</HI> and <HI>Glands</HI>
be made <HI>pervious.</HI> But this is not the
Fault of the <HI>Diet,</HI> but of the <HI>Di&s;temper;</HI>
for all the World knows and acknowleges,
that &s;uch a <HI>Diet</HI> makes <HI>Children, Farmers</HI>
and <HI>Country Per&s;ons,</HI> who can afford no
other <HI>Diet,</HI> look the fre&s;he&s;t, mo&s;t healthy
and lively; and this <HI>Diet</HI> never fails in one
&s;ingle In&s;tance, when the <HI>Cure</HI> is once thus
completed, the Juices &s;weeten'd, and the
Functions made regular and free, it never
fails, I &s;ay, to produce this Plumpne&s;s,
Liveline&s;s and Fre&s;hne&s;s. While the Cure
is performing, the greater the <HI>Wa&s;te</HI> of the
old morbid <HI>Habit</HI> is, the more perfect and
full will be the Recovery, and future <HI>Plump|ne&s;s,</HI>
provided the Wa&s;teing come from
the Thinne&s;s, Coolne&s;s and Softne&s;s of the
Diet only; without <HI>Hectic,</HI> violent Evacua|tion,
or evident <HI>Symptom</HI> of &s;ome <HI>noble
Bowel</HI> &s;poil'd; for then it is the &s;ure&s;t <HI>Mark</HI>
of their future perfect Recovery. A Per&s;on
who is two or three Years in <HI>wa&s;teing,</HI> and all
that time pur&s;ues the <HI>Lighte&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Lea&s;t,</HI>
will infallibly in as many more, or &s;ooner
perhaps, come to perfect Health and Plump|ne&s;s
again; and it is this <HI>Diet</HI> alone that can
prevent their running down too fa&s;t and pre|cipitatly,
and the only thing in Nature that
can put a Stop to their wa&s;teing, and, as it were,
put a <HI>Drag</HI> on the Wheels, to hinder them from
running too fa&s;t down Hill; for when the
<PB N="237" REF="253">
Juices are perfectly &s;weet, the <HI>Wa&s;teing</HI> will
cea&s;e, and the <HI>Plumping</HI> begin. When I
&s;ee a Per&s;on thin, meagre, and ill-colour'd,
I conclude, without asking Que&s;tions, that he
is under a <HI>Mal Regimen</HI> of <HI>Diet</HI> as to him,
whatever other Appearances of Health he may
have; and if he continue &s;o dureing a <HI>whole
Life,</HI> I conclude he continu'd under that im|proper
<HI>Regimen;</HI> for a proper, low, &s;oft
<HI>Diet</HI> will as infallibly at la&s;t (if no great <HI>Or|gan</HI>
be &s;poil'd) make him look fre&s;h, plump
and healthy, as <HI>Summer</HI> will &s;ucceed <HI>Winter.</HI>
A Per&s;on under a <HI>cachectic</HI> Habit, and <HI>chro|nical</HI>
Di&s;tempers, mu&s;t wa&s;te and throw off
every <HI>Fibre</HI> and Atom of that old <HI>Habit,</HI>
fluid and &s;olid, before he is renew'd, and
becomes plump and healthy again; and
tho&s;e who are under the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a
<HI>Diet,</HI> or under the <HI>Lighte&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Lea&s;t,</HI>
ought to expect <HI>this</HI> Degree of Recovery,
&s;ome &s;ooner, &s;ome later, according to the
Degree of the <HI>Malignity</HI> and Ob&s;tinacy of
the Di&s;temper, and to ground the Hopes of
the Degree of their future Recovery on this
<HI>Fact,</HI> and not to be puzzled and terrified by
Gain&s;ayers; for if they per&s;evere ob&s;tinatly
and &s;trictly, they will recover, and get plump,
gay, and healthy again, if none of the great
<HI>Organs</HI> be &s;poil'd; and even then they will
la&s;t longer, live ea&s;ier, and lie down more
gently: And this is the be&s;t can be expected
in &s;uch a bad Ca&s;e, where &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="238" REF="254">
<HI>Appendage</HI> or <HI>Organ</HI> to Li$e is quite and
irrecoverably &s;poil'd or lo&s;t; for no Diet, Me|dicin,
or Means, can create &s;uch an <HI>Organ</HI>
anew; and yet Nature has wonderful Re|&s;ources
even in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, under a low
&s;weetening Diet, either by makeing the re|maining
Part of the <HI>Organ</HI> &s;ufficient by its
<HI>Dilatation,</HI> and by opening new Pa&s;&s;ages, or
forming <HI>&s;uccedaneous Joints</HI> and <HI>Organs,</HI> to
make the Per&s;on la&s;t and become ea&s;y under
&s;uch a Misfortune; and we have In&s;tances of
Per&s;ons who have lived long and ea&s;y with
one <HI>Lobe</HI> of the <HI>Lungs</HI> or <HI>Liver,</HI> when the
other has adher'd or turn'd &s;cirrhous, and been
quite u&s;ele&s;s; and where the <HI>Hip-Joint</HI> di&s;lo|cated
has form'd a <HI>&s;uccedaneous</HI> one; and
where an <HI>Artery</HI> cut by inlarging the collateral
Branches, has nouri&s;h'd the Part, even there
where that cut <HI>Artery</HI> was originally directed:
But the&s;e Advantages can never happen, but
under a &s;oft, cool <HI>Diet.</HI> It is indeed a fatal
<HI>Symptom</HI> to wa&s;te and fall away under a full,
free, and <HI>high Diet:</HI> It is a certain <HI>Symptom</HI>
of a <HI>Non-a&s;&s;imilation,</HI> a Decay, or a &s;corbutic
and <HI>nervous Atrophy;</HI> it &s;hews want of Di|ge&s;tion,
or A&s;&s;imilation of the new <HI>Chyle</HI>
with the old Blood; but under a <HI>Milk</HI> and
<HI>Seed Diet,</HI> all the&s;e Faults and Inconveni|encies
are avoided, as much as the Nature of
the Ca&s;e will admit. Milk and Seeds will thin,
dilute, unite and incorporat with <HI>Glew</HI> &s;ooner
than Birdlime, Size, or Camp-Jelly diluted
<PB N="239" REF="255">
would; Water and aqueous Liquors warm'd,
will di&s;&s;olve and incorporat with the &s;tronge&s;t
<HI>Vi&s;co&s;ities,</HI> and are the only Sub&s;tances that can
po&s;&s;ibly do it: So that on the Whole, in bad
Ca&s;es, &s;izy Juices, <HI>lixivial</HI> and inflammatory
Blood, watery Fluids, with cool, &s;oft and light
&s;olid Powders or Mixtures of Seeds, as Milk-meats,
Seed-meats, and <HI>vegetable</HI> Food, mu&s;t
be allow'd to be the only po&s;&s;ible Mean in all
Nature, that can prevent this &s;o much dreaded
Wa&s;teing and Con&s;umeing; and they that
wa&s;te and fall away under it, mu&s;t con&s;ume
twice as fa&s;t in half the Time without it.
And it is ob&s;ervable in all tho&s;e who wa&s;te
in a mortal Di&s;temper, that their <HI>Atrophy</HI> is
always attended with and from &s;ome &s;en&s;ible
<HI>Evacuation,</HI> &s;uch as a <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> con&s;tant
Night-Sweats, an <HI>Haemorrhage,</HI> profu&s;e <HI>Ptya|li&s;m,</HI>
or a violent <HI>Cough;</HI> and tho&s;e who
wa&s;te in&s;en&s;ibly under a <HI>Regimen,</HI> are &s;eldom
in Danger of Death, but generally recover,
and grow fat at la&s;t, if the Wa&s;teing be not
attended with &s;ome profu&s;e Evacuation men|tion'd,
which implies the Corruption of &s;ome
nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Organ</HI> of Life. But this Ca&s;e be|ing
the mo&s;t formidable of any, will be fully
con&s;ider'd in the following Chapter.</P>
<P>&sect;. 18. IT is a common <HI>Objection</HI> again&s;t
a low and <HI>vegetable</HI> Diet, that it cuts off the
Means of a Cure, if either by <HI>Accident</HI> or
<HI>epidemical</HI> Cau&s;es, a Di&s;temper &s;eizes &s;uch a
<PB N="240" REF="256">
Per&s;on. But the&s;e Objectors do not con|&s;ider,
that by this their own <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> the
proper and mo&s;t effectual Cure of any Di&s;tem|per
is by a low Diet, &s;ince it &s;uppo&s;es this
Diet would cure the Di&s;temper when the
Party &s;eized were under any other <HI>Regimen,
viz.</HI> one of Meat and Wine. But to an&s;wer
the Objection <HI>directly;</HI> as to <HI>Accidents</HI> and
<HI>epidemical</HI> Di&s;tempers, I know no Fence
again&s;t them. If the Misfortune happens by
an <HI>Accident,</HI> none can doubt, that he who
has good Blood and Juices (and which this
<HI>Diet</HI> is &s;uppos'd always to produce) will
&s;ooner and more probably be cured by the
common Methods, than he who has the con|trary
<HI>Habit:</HI> And the &s;ame is to be &s;aid of
<HI>epidemical</HI> Di&s;tempers; he who has a good
&s;weet-blooded Habit, will have a better
Chance to get over them, than he who has
a morbid Con&s;titution. But, 1. Under a <HI>low
Diet</HI> it is a Contradiction, that a Man &s;hould
naturally, and from the common Laws of
the <HI>animal Oeconomy,</HI> fall into any dangerous,
painful, or mortal Di&s;temper; for the <HI>An|tidot,
i. e.</HI> the <HI>low Diet,</HI> is a continual Pre|&s;ervative,
as even this Objection &s;uppo&s;es,
and as Heat is a con&s;tant Pre&s;ervative again&s;t
Cold. But, 2. Suppo&s;e the impo&s;&s;ible Ca&s;e
&s;hould happen, it is but le&s;&s;ening the Quantity
of the Materials of the <HI>&s;ame Diet</HI> for &s;ome
time, with the common Medicins, which
will more effectually and &s;ooner cure the
<PB N="241" REF="257">
Di&s;temper, than it would be cured even in
de&s;cending from a full <HI>animal</HI> and <HI>vinous
Diet</HI> into a <HI>low</HI> one. But, in Fact, the Ob|jection
is both unnatural and unphilo&s;o|phical,
and implies its own An&s;wer.</P>
<P>&sect;. 19. IT may be the Opinion of &s;ome
Phy&s;icians, as well as of &s;ome Patients, that
Life, without <HI>&s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures</HI> and Enjoy|ments,
is not worth haveing; and there|fore,
when their <HI>Patients</HI> are by <HI>Luxury,</HI>
or <HI>hereditary Di&s;tempers,</HI> reduced to a very
<HI>low</HI> and <HI>wretched</HI> Condition, they think
the <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> of their Lives by &s;o long
and painful a <HI>Self-denial</HI> as is here pre|&s;cribed,
would be too dear a Purcha&s;e; or
that the <HI>Game</HI> is not worth the <HI>Candle:</HI>
and &s;o may pre&s;cribe very <HI>active</HI> and dan|gerous
Medicins at a <HI>Venture,</HI> either to re|lieve
or to end them; at the &s;ame time
indulgeing their deprav'd <HI>Appetites</HI> in what|ever
kinds of Meats and Drinks they <HI>crave,</HI>
or can get down. But &s;uch <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> do
not con&s;ider, that they are accountable to
the Community, to their Patient, to their
Con&s;ciences, and to their <HI>Maker,</HI> for every
Hour and Moment they &s;horten and cut off,
of the natural Duration of their Patients
Lives, by their immoral and murderous <HI>In|dulgence.</HI>
And the <HI>Patients</HI> do not duely
ponder, that <HI>Suicide</HI> (which this is in Effect)
is the mo&s;t mortal and irremi&s;&s;ible of all
<PB N="242" REF="258">
Sins: And Neither has &s;ufficiently weighed
the <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility,</HI> that the Party, if not quickly
cut off by both the&s;e prepo&s;terous Means,
may linger out mi&s;erably, and be twenty or
thirty Years a dying, under the&s;e <HI>Heart</HI> and
<HI>Wheel-breaking</HI> Mi&s;eries, thus exa&s;perated:
Whereas by the Methods I propo&s;e, if they
obtain not in time a perfect <HI>Cure,</HI> yet they
certainly thereby le&s;&s;en their <HI>Pain,</HI> length|en
their <HI>Days,</HI> and are continued, un|der
the <HI>Order</HI> of Providence over them,
and the benign <HI>Influence</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> of
<HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s, who has Healing under his
Wings;</HI> and, at wor&s;t, &s;often and lighten the
<HI>Angui&s;h</HI> of their Di&s;&s;olution, as far as the Na|ture
of Things will admit.</P>

Thinne&s;s, Wa&s;teing, or Valetudinarine&s;s of
Con&s;titution, from whatever Cau&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. 1. IT is certain every <HI>Animal</HI> (rational
or irrational) in perfect Health, where
all the <HI>Functions</HI> are regularly perform'd, and
who has at hand Sufficiency of proper Food,
mu&s;t become at la&s;t <HI>plump, fre&s;h,</HI> and <HI>roundi&s;h:</HI>
If it is otherwi&s;e, though there &s;hould be no
real Complaints of Di&s;orders <HI>felt</HI> or <HI>&s;en&s;ible,</HI>
yet there mu&s;t be a Defect &s;omewhere, either
of an improper <HI>Diet,</HI> an imperfect <HI>Di|ge&s;tion</HI>
or <HI>A&s;&s;imilation,</HI> or les'd internal <HI>Or|gans.</HI>
It is very po&s;&s;ible this Defect may not
be &s;en&s;ible or felt, while the <HI>Fibres</HI> and <HI>So|lids</HI>
are not yet come to their greate&s;t <HI>Exten|&s;ion,</HI>
that is in <HI>Youthhood;</HI> being hid and con|ceal'd
by the greater <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> and <HI>Volubility</HI>
of the&s;e Solids at that Time of <HI>Life.</HI> But if
there be an habitual <HI>Thinne&s;s, Leanne&s;s, Ten|derne&s;s,</HI>
and <HI>Valetudinarine&s;s,</HI> there mu&s;t be
&s;ome <HI>Dy&s;cra&s;y</HI> in the Juices, or Imbecillity in
the Solids, <HI>natural, hereditary,</HI> or acquir'd. The
<HI>intellectual Organs</HI> may be, and often are, in
<HI>&s;uch</HI> Con&s;titutions more acute, penetrating
and comprehen&s;ive, than in tho&s;e of the Fat
<PB N="244" REF="260">
and Plump, e&s;pecially if the&s;e la&s;t are over|loaded
with Clay; but the bodily Health of
the <HI>Lean</HI> and <HI>Wither'd</HI> is always &s;o tottering,
precarious, and &s;ubject to the &s;malle&s;t <HI>Acci|dents,</HI>
that it hinders even the Improvement
and Culture of &s;uch delicat intellectual <HI>Or|gans,</HI>
to that Height they might otherwi&s;e be
carried. If the&s;e <HI>Infirmities</HI> be only mid|dling
and tolerable, and not come to their
la&s;t Stage, a general <HI>Temperance, good Air,
Exerci&s;e,</HI> and a proper Care of all the <HI>Non-naturals,</HI>
may &s;uffice to carry on Life tole|rably,
to the Length of its natural Duration.
But when the wa&s;teing <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> is extremely bad,
ob&s;tinat, and dangerous, not yielding to the
be&s;t Advice and Means commonly u&s;ed, I
intend here to &s;ugge&s;t the mo&s;t probable <HI>Me|thod</HI>
known to me, or I think knowable in
the Nature of Things, to give &s;uch the be&s;t
Chance for an <HI>extirpative</HI> Cure, at lea&s;t for
as long a <HI>Life,</HI> as much <HI>Ea&s;e,</HI> and Freedom
of <HI>Spirits,</HI> as &s;uch a <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> will bear.</P>
<P>&sect;. 2. IN &s;uch a <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> and &s;uch a Stage of
it, as I have de&s;crib'd, there is nothing can
do any real Service but a &s;trict Milk and Seed
Diet; and if it has not been enter'd on be|fore,
it ought, without any He&s;itation or Pre|paration,
to be enter'd upon directly; e&s;pecially
if upon letting out a few Ounces of Blood
for Trial, it is found <HI>&s;izy,</HI> (as I could venture
my Life it will in &s;uch a Ca&s;e be, as I always
<PB N="245" REF="261">
found) no &s;uch <HI>Atrophy,</HI> or Thinne&s;s, being
ever po&s;&s;ible, or of any Duration, but where
the Blood is almo&s;t like <HI>Camp-jelly,</HI> &s;o as
that no <HI>A&s;&s;imilation</HI> can be made; and Milk
and Seeds can only furni&s;h out a <HI>Chyle,</HI> that
will gradually mix with, dilute, and thin this
old <HI>glewy Fluid,</HI> and prevent a mortal <HI>Wa&s;te|ing;</HI>
and in this <HI>Ca&s;e, A&s;s's Milk</HI> is far pre|ferable
to any other Kind, it being already
true, &s;weet, kindly <HI>Chyle,</HI> which only can
get through the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> probably almo&s;t
in its own unbroken State; and to which
all <HI>Chyle,</HI> that naturally nouri&s;hes, ought to
be &s;imilar in <HI>Fluidity</HI> and Sweetne&s;s, come it
from animal or vegetable Food; the Qua|lities
of <HI>A&s;s's Milk</HI> being, due Thinne&s;s or
Fluidity, Sweetne&s;s and <HI>Bal&s;am,</HI> which no
other <HI>Chyle</HI> or nutritive Milk, from either
animal or vegetable Food, has in &s;uch an Emi|nence;
and con&s;equently no other <HI>Milk</HI> or
<HI>Chyle</HI> is &s;o nutritive, or &s;o readily converti|ble
to <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>Blood.</HI> The greate&s;t <HI>Cures</HI> I
have ever &s;een perform'd in Di&s;tempers ab&s;o|lutely
de&s;pair'd of, in this Kind, have been
perform'd by <HI>A&s;s's Milk</HI> for Breakfa&s;t and
Supper, and only Cow Milk and Bread for
Dinner, hot in Winter, and cold in Summer-heats.
<HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>&s;corbutic Atrophies,</HI> and
Thinne&s;s in le&s;&s;er Degrees, may admit of
greater Variety of Foods. All the Garden
Things much boil'd, and dre&s;s'd with Cow
Milk, are much the &s;ame as a <HI>total Milk
<PB N="246" REF="262">
Diet,</HI> with the Difference only between <HI>ani|mal</HI>
and <HI>culinary</HI> Cookery; but a Milk and
Seed Diet, or even <HI>Milk</HI> only for <HI>Diet,</HI> (as
in Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> of <HI>Croyden's</HI> Ca&s;e) is the mo&s;t
infallible, and indeed the only proper Means
known or knowable, to give a <HI>Chance</HI> for a
<HI>Cure,</HI> in &s;uch a deplorable Ca&s;e as I have
repre&s;ented, or indeed in any de&s;perat Ca&s;e
whatever; and I am po&s;itive, if this <HI>Regimen</HI>
will not do, no other po&s;&s;ibly can; and if it
&s;hould not <HI>cure,</HI> it will ab&s;olutely prolong
<HI>Life</HI> more, and make the <HI>Symptoms</HI> milder:
But mo&s;t Patients will not be brought into it,
till it be too late. And here the <HI>artificial
A&s;s's Milk,</HI> of three Parts Barley-water, (made
with two Ounces of Barley, one of candied
<HI>Eringo</HI> Roots to three Pints of Water boil'd
to a Quart and &s;train'd, and a fourth Part of
boil'd and skimm'd Cow Milk added to it)
may be a good <HI>Succedaneum</HI> to natural <HI>A&s;s's
Milk,</HI> if it cannot be readily had.</P>
<P>&sect;. 3. So much for the <HI>Diet</HI> of &s;uch thin,
<HI>wa&s;teing,</HI> and <HI>valetudinary</HI> Patients, in its
la&s;t Stage: And as &s;uch have neither <HI>Dige&s;tion,</HI>
nor Strength to bear active &s;trong <HI>Evacua|tions,</HI>
or <HI>Alteratives,</HI> their Medicins mu&s;t
bear a <HI>Proportion</HI> to their <HI>Diet</HI> and Imbecil|lity;
there is no Evacuation proper and ac|commodated
to their Strength and Spirits,
but weak wa&s;h Vomits, often repeated, ten
or twelve Grains of Powder, or an Ounce of
<PB N="247" REF="263">
the Tincture of <HI>Ipecacuana</HI> work'd with Cha|momil-Flower-Tea,
and provok'd with a Fea|ther,
once a Week, or at lea&s;t every Full and
New Moon; but e&s;pecially upon <HI>Watchful|ne&s;s,
Flatus,</HI> &s;well'd <HI>Stomachs,</HI> or ca&s;ual <HI>Ex|acerbations</HI>
of <HI>Symptoms,</HI> to which all &s;uch
are generally &s;ubject: But what I much pre|fer
to all artificial <HI>Emetics,</HI> is tickling the
Throat and <HI>Glands</HI> with their Finger till
they <HI>keck,</HI> and then &s;pitting, or &s;uffering
the Phlegm to run out into a Ba&s;on; and
repeating this for thirty or forty differ|ent
times every Morning, or every &s;econd
or third Morning, or as often as they find a
Nece&s;&s;ity or Inclination to a painful or labo|rious
Belching or Explo&s;ion of Wind; for
by this Method long and duely pur&s;u'd, they
will empty the <HI>Glands</HI> of their <HI>Phlegm</HI> or
<HI>Choler,</HI> and pump up the <HI>penn'd</HI> Wind with
much more Ea&s;e and Safety, than by any
artificial <HI>Emetic</HI> what&s;oever; without tho&s;e
Deluges of nau&s;eous Draughts commonly
u&s;ed by unskilful <HI>Apothecaries,</HI> to &s;ave their
Time; when it is certain from Experience,
that a <HI>dry Vomit,</HI> with little or no Liquor,
though more painful, is infinitly more ef|fectual,
than two or three <HI>wet Vomits</HI> with
much drinking; for the great Efficacy of
<HI>Vomits</HI> lies in the <HI>Throws</HI> and <HI>Spa&s;ms</HI> on
the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> by which the
Ob&s;tructions in all the <HI>Glands</HI> are forced
open, the <HI>Size</HI> in the Juices is broken and
<PB N="248" REF="264">
divided, and the <HI>Per&s;piration</HI> render'd per|vious;
and by the&s;e <HI>Thumb Vomits,</HI> (as I call
them) without Drink, or Powders, together
with con&s;tant drinking A&s;s's Milk, I have done
<HI>my&s;elf</HI> more Service, in mending my Blood,
and plumping up the <HI>Mu&s;cles,</HI> as well as
many others, to whom I have communicated
and taught the <HI>Trick,</HI> than by all the other
Operations of <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> or <HI>Medicins</HI> I have
ever u&s;ed in &s;uch low and de&s;perat Ca&s;es.
This Method is only an Imitation of the <HI>Ope|rations</HI>
of Nature, which naturally and me|chanically
prompt all Per&s;ons loaded with
<HI>Phlegm, Choler,</HI> or Wind, by tickling their
Throat till they keck, to throw them off; which
generally relieves in &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, like
<HI>Sneezing;</HI> and <HI>Medicus debet &s;olummodo Na|turae
admini&s;trare.</HI> And any one who has an
Aver&s;ion to <HI>artificial Vomits,</HI> may by Prac|tice,
and bringing the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> of the <HI>Abdo|men</HI>
to an ea&s;y <HI>Play,</HI> get a Facility in this
<HI>Trick,</HI> for his certain Relief on all nece&s;&s;ary
Occa&s;ions, as I have found to my great Com|fort,
and the Relief of many others, e&s;peci|ally
the Delicat&punc; <HI>Hy&s;terical,</HI> Wa&s;ted, and Low-&s;pirited:
But it mu&s;t be pur&s;ued with Ob&s;ti|nacy
and Per&s;everance, till a Facility be ac|quir'd.</P>
<P>&sect;. 4. THE only Inconveniency of &s;uch fre|quent
<HI>Thumb</HI> or other <HI>Vomits</HI> is, that the nece&s;|&s;ary
<HI>$word$</HI> cau&s;ed by them &s;ometimes makes
<PB N="249" REF="265">
them extremely and painfully <HI>co&s;tive.</HI> But &s;o
far is this from being a real Evil, that it is
one of the be&s;t Effects the&s;e <HI>Vomits</HI> can pro|duce;
for any Degree of Loo&s;ene&s;s or Purge|ing
is almo&s;t certain Death to &s;uch Per&s;ons,
and they generally go off in a <HI>Colliquative
Diarrhoea,</HI> which the&s;e <HI>Thumb-Vomits</HI> gene|rally
remedy or prevent; for the&s;e <HI>Diarrhoea's</HI>
in &s;uch tender and <HI>thin</HI> Per&s;ons, not only
carry off all their Food, but indicat that the
whole <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of the Solids and <HI>Nerves</HI> are
irrecoverably relax'd. But &s;hould &s;uch a
<HI>Co&s;tivene&s;s</HI> be ob&s;tinat and trouble&s;ome, a
little <HI>lenitive</HI> Electuary over Night, a
Drachm of <HI>Lac</HI> or <HI>Flores Sulphuris,</HI> an <HI>An|der&s;on</HI>'s
or a <HI>Rufi</HI> Pill or two, will &s;afely and
gently relieve; a Milk or a Broth Cly&s;ter,
with a little Oil of Sweet <HI>Almonds,</HI> will
bring forth the harden'd Balls, that ob&s;truct
the <HI>peri&s;taltic</HI> Motion; &s;upping on Apples
and Milk, &s;tew'd <HI>Prunes</HI> with <HI>Senna,</HI> or any
&s;uch-like gentle <HI>Aperient,</HI> will con&s;tantly
relieve this <HI>Symptom:</HI> But in Reality, unle&s;s
it becomes extremely painful and ob&s;tinat, it
is much better to bear than relieve it; for
thereby the Food has a longer Time to pa&s;s
the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> to mend the Blood, and plump
up the <HI>Mu&s;cles,</HI> and to allow the Solids and
<HI>Nerves</HI> to con&s;tringe, to cri&s;p up, and regain
their <HI>Buckle</HI> and Spring; for I know nothing
that depre&s;&s;es the Spirits, wa&s;tes the Fle&s;h,
and relaxes the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of the Nerves
<PB N="250" REF="266">
and Solids, &s;o much as frequent and copious
Purgeing and Stooling, as is well known in
the common and unnatural <HI>Cure</HI> of the <HI>Go|norrhoea
Virulenta;</HI> and therefore I &s;eldom
or never u&s;e any <HI>Purgatives</HI> my&s;elf, nor pre|&s;cribe
them to my <HI>nervous</HI> and <HI>valetudinary</HI>
Patients: More Ab&s;tinence even under a low
Diet, more Exerci&s;e, and <HI>Thumb-Vomits,</HI> always
&s;upply to me the Place of <HI>Cathartics,</HI> in &s;uch
delicat Ca&s;es: It is only the Strong, Robu&s;t, and
tho&s;e of too hard and firm <HI>Nerves,</HI> that &s;ucce&s;s|fully
bear much Purgeing; and I think two
pretty &s;evere Vomits hurt not the Con&s;titution
&s;o much as one <HI>dra&s;tic</HI> Purge; for it is notori|ou&s;ly
known in all &s;uch Ca&s;es and Con&s;titutions
as are now under Con&s;ideration, that it is the
<HI>Relaxation</HI> and Imbecillity of the Stomach
that is the great Cau&s;e of all their Sufferings,
together with the Vi&s;cidity of the Juices;
and if the&s;e be &s;ufficiently attended to, all
the re&s;t will come about in Time; the <HI>Sto|mach</HI>
it&s;elf, like a broken Leg, by giving it
little to do, or u&s;ing it very &s;pareingly, will
knit, thicken, and con&s;olidat of it&s;elf mecha|nically;
the infinit Glands of the Stomach
and Guts, con&s;tantly &s;pewing out their vi&s;cid
Contents, want frequent Clean&s;eings by
<HI>Thumb-Vomits;</HI> below they are fewer to|wards
the <HI>Rectum</HI> and <HI>Anus,</HI> and &s;o the&s;e
want fewer Clean&s;eings by Purgeing.</P>

&sect;. 5. WHEN the <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Juices</HI> are
<HI>thick, vi&s;cid,</HI> and <HI>glewy,</HI> (as they always are
in &s;uch Ca&s;es) and thereby all the <HI>Capillaries</HI>
and &s;maller <HI>Lymphatic</HI> Ve&s;&s;els are &s;tuffed, ob|&s;tructed,
and compre&s;&s;ed, nothing will give
them Relief, Freedom, and <HI>Roomyne&s;s,</HI> like
little frequent <HI>Phlebotomies,</HI> three, four, five,
or &s;ix Ounces at mo&s;t every <HI>Week, Month,</HI> or
<HI>Quarter,</HI> as they can bear it, or as the Blood
appears when let out of a large Orifice; but
it is never to be continued after the Blood
hath lo&s;t its <HI>Buff,</HI> or its <HI>liveri&s;h Cra&s;&s;ity,</HI> nor
after the Patient goes into Fainting, or long
Lowne&s;s upon <HI>Letting;</HI> for if either of the&s;e
en&s;ue to any Degree, it is a certain Sign
<HI>Phlebotomy</HI> will no longer do (no not
in any Ca&s;e where <HI>Phlebotomy</HI> is perform'd;
for where it is proper, it will always rai&s;e
the Spirits in a little time after); nor is the
Evil in the great <HI>Trunk</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, but in the
&s;malle&s;t Branches and <HI>Capillaries,</HI> for which
another Method is to be tried, afterwards to
be &s;ugge&s;ted. But as long as the <HI>Blood</HI> is &s;till
cover'd with a <HI>Buff</HI> or Parchment, its <HI>Curd</HI>
&s;till <HI>liveri&s;h,</HI> and its <HI>Serum</HI> yellow, tawny, or
&s;alti&s;h, and the <HI>Patient</HI> has rather better than
wor&s;e <HI>Spirits</HI> after it, little frequent <HI>Phlebo|tomies</HI>
will be of great Service to give the
Juiees room to circulat, to take off the Re|&s;i&s;tance
from them, to the <HI>motive</HI> and <HI>ela&s;tic</HI>
Powers of the <HI>Organs</HI> and <HI>Solids,</HI> and to
&s;upply its Room with &s;oft, mild, &s;weet and
<PB N="252" REF="268">
&s;ound Juices, which by Degrees will <HI>a&s;&s;i|milat</HI>
and mix with the old <HI>vi&s;cid Ma&s;s,</HI> and
mend it. I have known beginning <HI>Phthi&s;es
Pulmonum, Hectics, Pleuri&s;ies</HI> and <HI>Rheuma|ti&s;ms,</HI>
often prevented or cured by the&s;e, when
a &s;oft, &s;weet whey <HI>Diet</HI> has been join'd to them.</P>
<P>&sect;. 6. WHEN the <HI>Blood</HI> is brought to a
pretty tolerable State in the <HI>Trunks</HI> of the
great Ve&s;&s;els, and the Fault &s;eems now con|fin'd
to the <HI>Glands, Capillaries,</HI> or <HI>Lym|phatics,</HI>
the <HI>alterative</HI> Medicins, that are mo&s;t
likely, that I ever could find to reach them,
were <HI>Cinnabar native</HI> or <HI>factitious,</HI> the <HI>Aqua
Argentea, Millepedae, Nitre,</HI> and <HI>Lac Sul|phuris,</HI>
with the <HI>Te&s;tacea,</HI> combin'd in &s;uch
Forms as were mo&s;t agreeable to the Patient,
or &s;at lighte&s;t on the Stomach. I can hone&s;tly
aver it, I never &s;aw &s;uch &s;alutary Effects
in any ob&s;tinat <HI>Ca&s;es,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;uch as
tho&s;e now under Con&s;ideration, as from long
Per&s;everance under large Do&s;es of <HI>native</HI> or
<HI>factitious Cinnabar,</HI> wa&s;h'd down with A&s;s's
Milk, or &s;weet Whey. It &s;eldom gives any
Trouble, unle&s;s it be in the Stomach at fir&s;t;
and has no &s;en&s;ible Operation, but &s;weeten|ing
and attenuating the Blood in the &s;malle&s;t
Ve&s;&s;els gradually: It only keeps from trou|ble&s;ome
<HI>Co&s;tivene&s;s</HI> &s;uch weak <HI>Con&s;titutions,</HI>
by the <HI>Sulphur</HI> in its Compo&s;ition. I have
given it for a long Time to <HI>three Drachms</HI> a
Day in any Vehicle; and twice a Year, Spring
and Fall, for &s;ix Weeks; and had it continued
<PB N="253" REF="269">
for twenty Years, by which the Patient has
grown &s;trong and fat at la&s;t. And I take it
to be a much nobler Medicin for mending
the Blood, and opening the Capillary <HI>Glands,</HI>
and preventing acute Di&s;tempers, provided
due Temperance and Exerci&s;e be join'd to it,
than even my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s &s;o fam'd <HI>Catho|licon
Nitre,</HI> which yet is mo&s;t certainly a
noble Simple, and the greate&s;t <HI>Antidot</HI> again&s;t
<HI>Inflammations</HI> and <HI>feveri&s;h</HI> Di&s;orders known
to Men. Experience &s;hews that it attenuats
and malaxes the <HI>Curd</HI> of the Blood, and
thins its vi&s;cid <HI>Serum,</HI> even in the Air, or
in Blood let out; and its Effects on <HI>Fire,</HI> and
in <HI>Re&s;piration,</HI> prove it the greate&s;t Friend
to <HI>animal</HI> Bodies. The <HI>Millepedae,</HI> as is
known, are nothing but a &s;imple kind of <HI>Sal
Armoniac,</HI> or <HI>Nitre, mill'd</HI> by <HI>animal Or|gans,</HI>
and intimatly mix'd with <HI>animal</HI> Juices;
and is noted for its Efficacy in Inflammations
on the Eyes, and Ob&s;tructions in the <HI>optic</HI>
Nerves and <HI>Glands,</HI> and &s;ure they are among
the mo&s;t delicat of <HI>animal Organs.</HI> The Fault
is, the&s;e are not given long enough, nor in
&s;ufficient Quantity, to produce any great or
&s;en&s;ible Effects: But I firmly believe them to
be far beyond all your now fam'd <HI>chymical</HI>
and quack <HI>Secrets,</HI> Drops or Pills, if a pro|per
Regimen be join'd with them, and are
without all po&s;&s;ible Danger to the weake&s;t
<HI>Infant.</HI> As to the <HI>Te&s;tacea,</HI> their Nature
and Operation are &s;ufficiently known, and
<PB N="254" REF="270">
their Texture vi&s;ible by a common <HI>Micro|&s;cope,
viz.</HI> that they are only &s;olid <HI>Spunges,</HI>
which &s;uck, <HI>attract</HI> and receive into their
<HI>Pores</HI> all <HI>Acids</HI> where-ever they meet them,
e&s;pecially in the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> where <HI>Acids</HI>
are chiefly to be found; and I am certain,
<HI>Cinnabar, Crabs-eyes, Nitre,</HI> and <HI>Cochineal,</HI>
finely powder'd, and wa&s;h'd down with any
agreeable acidulated Draught, &s;uch as the
<HI>&s;olin</HI> one of <HI>Salt</HI> of <HI>Wormwood,</HI> and Juice
of Lemon duely mix'd in common Water,
Milk, or Barley-water acidulated with <HI>Cur|rant-Jelly,</HI>
and the like, is one of the be&s;t
<HI>Febrifuges</HI> known to Men, particularly where
no <HI>cutaneous</HI> Eruption, or <HI>critical</HI> Pu&s;h, is
expected; for then the&s;e Medicins mu&s;t be
a&s;&s;i&s;ted with &s;ome warmer con&s;tringent and
propelling Mixtures, to forward this Effect.</P>

warm Flanel, but e&s;pecially the <HI>Fle&s;h-bru&s;h,</HI>
over the whole Body, and particularly the
<HI>Spine</HI> and <HI>Limbs,</HI> is an admirable Operation
to allicit the Blood and Juices to the Surface
of the Body, and con&s;equently to plump the
<HI>Mu&s;cles.</HI> It rubs out and di&s;charges the
<HI>Plugs</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;tructions</HI> in the Orifices of the
per&s;piratory <HI>Glands;</HI> and if the whole Skin
be wa&s;h'd after with a <HI>wet Towel</HI> in warm
Water in cold Weather, and in cold Water
in hot Weather, it will contribute to free it
from the <HI>Scurf,</HI> and chopp'd <HI>Cuticle,</HI> that clogs
<PB N="255" REF="271">
the <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI> which will greatly &s;erve to
promote the <HI>Circulation;</HI> and this <HI>Method</HI>
ought to be continued for half or a quarter
of an Hour, Morning and Night; and a clo&s;e
&s;treight-button'd Cotton <HI>Wai&s;tcoat,</HI> for con|&s;tant
Friction, ought to be worn next the
Skin, and a <HI>broad Belt</HI> about the <HI>Loins,</HI> to
keep all the Bowels and the <HI>Lacteals</HI> in their
proper and natural Situation.</P>
<P>&sect;. 8. WHEN the <HI>Blood</HI> is in a good mea|&s;ure
thinn'd and &s;weeten'd, (which a little
<HI>Phlebotomy</HI> will always di&s;cover, by com|paring
the Blood with that of a Sheep or
Calf) the be&s;t Medicins for braceing, tanning
and hardening the Solids, the alimentary
Tubes in particular, are the <HI>Bark,</HI> and its Pre|parations,
the <HI>Extract</HI> of the <HI>Bark</HI> with a
third part of the Extract of <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> made
into Pills with <HI>Bal&s;amum Polychre&s;t.</HI> or an

about half a Drachm or forty Grains of the&s;e
twice a Day on an empty Stomach, wa&s;h'd
down with <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Water, or the following
<HI>Apozem, viz.</HI> &s;ix Drachms of powder'd
<HI>Quinquina,</HI> half an Ounce of <HI>Mi&s;leto,</HI> three
Drachms of the <HI>Extract</HI> of <HI>wild Valerian,</HI>
two of <HI>Orange</HI> Peel, half a Drachm of <HI>Car|damoms,</HI>
and one Drachm of <HI>Cochineal,</HI> in|fus'd

a Quart, &s;train'd and filtred, about four or
five Spoonfuls of this for a Do&s;e, for &s;ix
<PB N="256" REF="272">
Weeks, Spring and Fall; chewing and &s;wallow|ing
a Scruple or half a Drachm of fine <HI>Je&s;uits
Bark</HI> three times a Day, on an empty Stomach,

and ten or fifteen Drops of <HI>Elixir</HI> of <HI>Vitriol</HI>
in a Gla&s;s of fre&s;h <HI>Spa</HI> or <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water,
(if it does not tighten too quickly, or pain
&s;uch tender Entrails) taken twice a Day,
would much &s;erve the &s;ame End, and give
Appetite, Strength and Spirits.</P>
<P>&sect;. 9. COLD Batheing in the <HI>Sea,</HI> or a <HI>Ri|ver,</HI>
a cold <HI>Bath,</HI> or Batheing-Tub, at lea&s;t
all the hot Part of the Summer, would greatly
advance the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; but even this &s;o
effectual a <HI>Strengthener</HI> will be of little or
no Value, unle&s;s the <HI>Blood</HI> be already thinn'd
and &s;weeten'd. I my&s;elf have tried it many
Hundreds of Times, with no manner of Be|nefit;
nay, in &s;ome it has been attended with
many Incommodities, and much Danger of vio|lent
<HI>Head-achs, Chills, Contractions</HI> and <HI>Inter|mittent
Fevers,</HI> if too long or too ha&s;tily pur|&s;ued,
before the Blood was mended, which
when effected, both I and many others have
found great Benefit from it; &s;o that I have
never advis'd Cold Batheing &s;ince, without
previou&s;ly, by <HI>Phlebotomy,</HI> &s;eeing into the
State of their Juices and Bowels; and always
forbad it, when I found them bad. It is
always nece&s;&s;ary, at lea&s;t at fir&s;t, to have the
Head well &s;pung'd, and cool'd with cold Wa|ter,
<PB N="257" REF="273">
before plungeing; and they &s;hould either
be thrown in Head-foremo&s;t, or, which I
think &s;afe&s;t, walk down the Steps as fa&s;t as
they can, and bending their Knees, and &s;hort|ening
their Bodies, get their Heads under
Water; this for three or four times in the cold
Bath, and out again, which ought not to
exceed two or three Minutes. In a River or
the Sea they may continue ten or fifteen
Minutes: For, like all other <HI>medical</HI> Ope|rations,
it is much better to be perform'd
often, and but little at once, than to be
long about it at one time: <HI>Gutta cavat la|pidem
non vi, &s;ed &s;aepe cadendo.</HI> It is cer|tainly,
in valetudinary and wa&s;ted Con&s;titu|tions,
of great Efficacy in warm Sea&s;ons,
when the Blood is &s;ufficiently thinn'd.</P>
<P>&sect;. 10. BUT no Rule or In&s;titution for
braceing the Solids and Nerves is equal to
<HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of all kinds. <HI>Rideing, Coaching,
Walking, Bowling,</HI> playing at <HI>Shuttlecock;</HI> in
&s;hort, all Exerci&s;e of whatever kind it be, is
good and beneficial. In Winter and bad
Weather, within Doors the <HI>Tremou&s;&s;oir,</HI> a
<HI>Hamock,</HI> the <HI>Dumb-Bell,</HI> plying a <HI>Pump,</HI>
walking in a Gallery, or a <HI>Suite</HI> of Rooms;
in good Weather the&s;e other mentioned Ex|erci&s;es,
and many more mentioned by <HI>Gy|mna&s;tic</HI>
Writers, of which the ingenious Vale|tudinarian
may contrive &s;ome properly &s;uited
to the Weakne&s;s of his particular <HI>Organs,</HI> or
<PB N="258" REF="274">
Limbs: But none of them will be of any great
Efficacy, without joining a proper &s;weetening
and diluteing <HI>Regimen. Exerci&s;e</HI> ought to be
con&s;tant, uniform and regular as <HI>Diet,</HI> and
to be pur&s;ued on an empty Stomach, at as
great a Di&s;tance from Meals as is po&s;&s;ible; not
violent, nor long at a time, but orderly at
proper Hours; and no more interrupted any
long time than Food; not to Sweating, but
to Warmth. I am greatly per&s;uaded Rideing
is be&s;t for Dige&s;tion, for di&s;per&s;ing and open|ing
<HI>abdominal</HI> and <HI>me&s;eraic glandular</HI> Ob|&s;tructions;
but Walking is be&s;t for <HI>Nutrition,</HI>
di&s;tributing the <HI>Chyle,</HI> and plumping up the
<HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;cles.</HI> Violence and Ob&s;tinacy
in Exerci&s;e of any kind, is de&s;tructive to
Health, and has the &s;ame ill Con&s;equences as
all other <HI>Exce&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 11. IT is &s;urpri&s;ing, that Mankind, <HI>Phy|&s;icians</HI>
e&s;pecially, have been &s;o late in exa|mining
and di&s;covering the great Benefit of
<HI>mineral</HI> Waters of the &s;everal kinds. Fir&s;t
Plants, Fruits, Seeds, and Roots, were tried
for the <HI>Cure</HI> of Di&s;tempers; and in examining
them, little el&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve but
the U&s;e the &s;everal kinds of <HI>Animals</HI> made
of them for their Food or Phy&s;ic, when ail|ing
or aggriev'd: After that, Men ob&s;erv'd
what Effect the Juices and Fle&s;h of &s;everal
<HI>Animals</HI> had on &s;ome Con&s;titutions and Di&s;|orders,
for Food or Phy&s;ic; then they pra|ctis'd
<PB N="259" REF="275">
on the Minerals of all kinds, which was
a mo&s;t unnatural and <HI>unphilo&s;ophical</HI> Cour&s;e of
Medicins, at lea&s;t when not infinitly levigated
and refin'd; and even then &s;carce ever proper
to enter an <HI>animal</HI> Body, or its delicat <HI>Mean|ders,</HI>
at lea&s;t humanly prepar'd; as we &s;ee
by the <HI>brute</HI> Creation, which by no Art will

even in Water for Drink. But to fit
the <HI>Minerals,</HI> (even again&s;t the Intentions and
in &s;pite of Nature) the <HI>Tortures</HI> of the Fire
in <HI>chymical</HI> Preparations have been found out
and applied, which I am convinc'd have been
more pernicious and de&s;tructive to human
Creatures, either in its <HI>vegetable</HI> or <HI>animal,</HI>
much more in its <HI>mineral Products,</HI> than
<HI>Gunpowder</HI> it&s;elf; and all this Time the &s;alu|tary
Effects of the natural, or, I may &s;ay, the
divine Preparations of the <HI>mineral</HI> Tribe, com|bined,
proportioned and divided infinitly in
the &s;everal kinds of <HI>mineral Waters,</HI> have been
overlook'd; and yet, I may &s;ay, there is &s;carce
a <HI>Mile &s;quare</HI> on the Surface of the <HI>Globe,</HI> at
lea&s;t not a Mountain or even Hillock, where
there &s;prings not up &s;ome <HI>mineral</HI> Water,
fitted for the Cure of human Di&s;tempers in
all the kinds of Medicin, <HI>Evacuant, Altera|tive,</HI>
or <HI>Strengthening,</HI> if duely examined,
and judiciou&s;ly directed, e&s;pecially if a proper
<HI>Regimen</HI> of Diet were joined to them. And
I think it Demon&s;tration, that where there is
a <HI>Hill</HI> or con&s;iderable Eminence, there mu&s;t
be a <HI>mineral</HI> Water, &s;ince a Hill is nothing
<PB N="260" REF="276">
but the Ne&s;t of &s;ome <HI>Mineral;</HI> but there will
be requir'd Skill and Experience to fit them
to the Di&s;ea&s;e and the Patient. I &s;hould
hope, &s;ince the infinit Variety of <HI>mineral</HI> Wa|ters
in his Maje&s;ty's Dominions, have been
begun to be carefully examin'd, and their
&s;everal Compo&s;itions, Natures, and Virtues,
have been, with &s;ome Exactne&s;s, inquir'd into
and found, if Temperance and <HI>Propriety</HI> in
<HI>Diet</HI> were univer&s;ally &s;tudied and recom|mended,
the better &s;ort of People might pa&s;s
their Lives in le&s;s <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> than they common|ly
do; for I cannot but think the <HI>Author</HI> of
Nature, who has &s;o liberally provided for the
Wants and Nece&s;&s;ities of all his Creatures,
(among which Want of Health is the mo&s;t
material and weighty for all the Ends of Live|ing,
in order to pre&s;ent or future Felicity)
has appointed and marked out, by his own
<HI>Signature,</HI> &s;ome general <HI>one</HI> for this Purpo&s;e;
and in fifty Years Study and Ob&s;ervation, I
could never yet meet with any one that has this
<HI>Mark</HI> of divine Appointment &s;o glareingly as
a <HI>low Diet</HI> in general, and in particular Ca&s;es
a <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Diet, or a Diet of very
little animal Food, and common or <HI>mineral</HI>
Water Beverage of one <HI>&s;pecific</HI> Kind or
other, fitted to the Complaints and <HI>Sym|ptoms.</HI>
The Determination of the <HI>&s;pecific
Mineral</HI> Water mu&s;t be left to the Sagacity
of the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> in ordinary, and to the
Kinds, Degrees, and &s;everal Stages of the
<PB N="261" REF="277">
Di&s;tempers. But I think one or other may
be ea&s;ily found, that would greatly alleviat
the Complaints of mo&s;t <HI>Valetudinarians;</HI> and
few or none of them are much hurtful
in any Ca&s;e, but what the <HI>Patient</HI> will
readily find him&s;elf, or an ordinary <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI>
may di&s;tingui&s;h. The chalybeat mineral Wa|ters
are all A&s;tringent and Invigorating, the
&s;alin all Evacuant, and the cretaceous all Alte|rative
and Sweetening, and a Mixture of Prin|ciples
has a compounded Effect.</P>
<P>&sect;. 12. IT is of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence,
that &s;uch <HI>valetudinarian,</HI> wa&s;ted, thin Con|&s;titutions,
breathe a good, kindly and benign
<HI>Air.</HI> I have often had Occa&s;ion to mention
of what U&s;e and Nece&s;&s;ity the <HI>Air</HI> is to atte|nuat,
enliven and brighten <HI>animal Blood</HI> and
Juices, as is manife&s;t from the Difference
between the <HI>arterial</HI> Blood <HI>mill'd</HI> and clari|fy'd
by the <HI>Air</HI> and its <HI>Nitre</HI> in the <HI>Lungs,</HI>
and the <HI>venal</HI> Blood, which has not as yet
gone through that Operation, or is &s;tumm'd in
its &s;low and remoter <HI>Circulation.</HI> A pure,
clean, tepid, dry <HI>Air,</HI> &s;aturated with a due
Degree of <HI>volatil Nitre,</HI> and the Steams of
<HI>odoriferous</HI> and <HI>&s;anative Plants,</HI> induces a
<HI>Bal&s;am</HI> and Liveline&s;s on <HI>animal</HI> Juices, as
is evident from the Difference between <HI>Sum|mer</HI>
and <HI>Winter,</HI> fair and cloudy Weather,
on <HI>Animals</HI> of all Kinds; and therefore a
<HI>Valetudinarian</HI> &s;hould chu&s;e to live in an
<PB N="262" REF="278">
open <HI>Champaign</HI> Country, guarded from
Northerly and Ea&s;terly Winds, of a moderat
Elevation, or in a <HI>Medium</HI> between the <HI>Tops</HI>

<P>&sect;. 13. I HAVE been longer and more par|ticular

this Ca&s;e in its la&s;t <HI>Stage,</HI> and wor&s;t State,

either in <HI>Death,</HI> or &s;uch a Degree of <HI>Recovery</HI>

expect, or ri&s;e to; which can never indeed be to
the Force and Vigour of a <HI>Kite</HI> or <HI>Carrion-Crow,</HI>

<HI>Nightingale</HI> or <HI>Lark:</HI> And I have labour'd
it more, as to <HI>Per&s;picuity</HI> and <HI>Detail,</HI> than
that of any other <HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;temper, be|cau&s;e

<HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> of this or the&s;e Di&s;orders, will

their Days.</P>
<P>11. AN habitual <HI>A&s;thma,</HI> if managed with
a <HI>Milk and Seed Diet, Quick&s;ilver</HI> well puri|fied
half an Ounce twice a Day, <HI>Squill Vo|mits</HI>
about <HI>new</HI> and <HI>full</HI> Moon, and after

<P>12. IN a painful and dangerous <HI>Pleuri&s;y,</HI>
after a good part of the <HI>Size</HI> of the Blood
has been drawn off by large <HI>Phlebotomies,</HI>
and the Di&s;temper, by <HI>&s;aponaceous</HI> and oily

if a <HI>total Milk and Seed Diet</HI> were in&s;tituted

<HI>Tartar Emetic,</HI> repeated every <HI>new</HI> and <HI>full

A&s;tringents, (Bark e&s;pecially) were imploy'd

does but add Fewel to the Di&s;temper; and
generally the Di&s;temper returns in a greater

<P>14. IN any <HI>Haemorrhage,</HI> either from the
<HI>Lungs, No&s;e, Anus</HI> or <HI>Uterus,</HI> how violent

<P>7. I HAVE hinted at the chief Source of
<HI>Infertility</HI> in the <HI>Male</HI> Sex, which, be&s;ides
Accidents and a <HI>Mal formation,</HI> is chiefly
owing to the <HI>Luxury</HI> of the Individual him|&s;elf,
if he has been born &s;ound, or has not de|riv'd
corrupted Juices from his <HI>Parents:</HI> In all
which Ca&s;es, nothing will re&s;tore <HI>Fertility,</HI>
but what mends the Con&s;titution, the <HI>Rules</HI>
for which I have laid down, with great Plain|ne&s;s,
in this <HI>Treati&s;e.</HI> The <HI>Infertility</HI> of the
<HI>Female Sex</HI> is owing to one of the&s;e three
<HI>Cau&s;es.</HI> 1. A too great <HI>Flux</HI> of the <HI>Men|&s;trual
Purification,</HI> for which the proper
<PB N="284" REF="300">
<HI>Cure</HI> is directed above, under that <HI>Symptom.</HI>
2. From too &s;mall a <HI>Flow</HI> of the &s;ame, (which,
I think, in a <HI>Medium,</HI> ought to be about two
Ounces) for which al&s;o the <HI>Remedy</HI> is &s;ug|ge&s;ted
under the Head of <HI>Ob&s;tructions:</HI> Or,
3. From a Weakne&s;s that happens in the In|tervals
of the <HI>Men&s;truations,</HI> called the <HI>Fluor
Albus,</HI> de&s;cribed and pre&s;cribed for above
likewi&s;e. Frequent <HI>Mi&s;carriages</HI> attend all
the&s;e <HI>three</HI> Cau&s;es, often at all times, but
mo&s;t commonly between the <HI>third</HI> and <HI>fourth</HI>
Month, when the Weight of the <HI>Foetus</HI> is too
great for the <HI>contractive</HI> Powers of the
<HI>Uterus,</HI> whereby it is forced away before its
due Time; which is a plain and manife&s;t
Symptom of tender and relaxed <HI>Nerves</HI> and
Solids in the Mother, and which ought to
be a Warning to <HI>both Parents,</HI> to &s;et about
all po&s;&s;ible Means to &s;trengthen and brace
the Solids, at lea&s;t of the Mother, in order
to prevent the future Progre&s;s of this <HI>Imbe|$ility;</HI>
which Means, the be&s;t known to me,
and the mo&s;t rational and &s;ucce&s;sful I have
ob&s;erved or read of, I intend now to &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>8. WHEN a married young Woman be|gins
to mi&s;carry naturally, and without any
Accident, &s;he rarely goes on after to the full
Time, but mi&s;carries regularly every three or
four Months, till either &s;he gives over Breed|ing,

it can be &s;afely done, &s;he ought to be blooded
&s;ix or &s;even Ounces, out of a large Orifice at
the Arm, to examin into the State of the

Health in the Mother be otherwi&s;e, till the
Blood be thinned and <HI>balmified,</HI> which can
only be done the &s;oone&s;t, by little <HI>Phleboto|mies,</HI>

for <HI>braceing</HI> tender <HI>Nerves,</HI> and mending bad
Juices; which will be &s;ooner effected in the

have often cured <HI>Infertility</HI> in the <HI>Sex,</HI> and
prevented <HI>Abortion,</HI> and improved their Con|&s;titution,
when the Blood and Con&s;titution
has not been very bad. But upon this Exa|mination
of the Blood by <HI>Phlebotomy,</HI> if the
<HI>Curd</HI> is found to be thin, wateri&s;h, and too
&s;oft and &s;pungy; then real <HI>Cold batheing</HI> long

not carry them on to their full Time; then
nothing is &s;o likely to do as <HI>&s;ole</HI> Water-drink|ing:
Common Water, with a little Milk, and
tepid <HI>Spa</HI> or <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and animal Food, the
younge&s;t and lighte&s;t, and at Noon only, and
Milk Meats (<HI>A&s;s's</HI> or <HI>Cow's</HI>) for Breakfa&s;t and
Supper, during the whole Time of their
<HI>Pregnancy. Wine</HI> and all fermented Liquors,
give too great a Velocity to the Blood, pu&s;h
it onwards with too &s;trong a <HI>Momentum,</HI>
force open the <HI>uterin</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, and drive off
the <HI>Placenta</HI> from the <HI>Fund</HI> of the <HI>Uterus,</HI>
by opening the <HI>Sphincters</HI> of the <HI>men&s;trual</HI>
Flux; &s;o that the <HI>Foetus</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily come
off, which is never to be retain'd by <HI>Art</HI> or
<HI>a&s;tringent</HI> Medicin, after the parturient Wo|man
finds a Tendency in her Bowels to part
with it. All that can be done then, is by gentle
<HI>Forcers</HI> or <HI>Volatils,</HI> together with &s;oft <HI>Oils</HI> and
<HI>Bal&s;amics</HI> united to mild <HI>Opiats,</HI> to quiet Na|ture;
and leaving her to her own <HI>Play,</HI> pati|ently
wait her Time and Manner; for, to u&s;e
<HI>A&s;tringents</HI> in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, is like &s;etting the

10. IF this Method &s;hould al&s;o prove un|&s;ucce&s;sful
to procure <HI>Fertility,</HI> and prevent
<HI>Abortion</HI> in tender young married Women,
as it often does in tho&s;e who are tolerably
healthy; a <HI>total Milk</HI> and <HI>Seed Diet,</HI> rigidly
continued for a Year or two, cannot fail;
e&s;pecially if due Care of the other Non-na|turals

come, under this <HI>Regimen,</HI> I ever beheld; and
I am fully per&s;uaded, if any thing in Nature
can prevent <HI>Infertility,</HI> and bring fine Chil|dren,
it is a <HI>Milk and Seed Diet,</HI> continued
both by <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother,</HI> till the Effect be

of the Children, if they come, it being the
&s;ame, Nature puts them under as &s;oon as they
&s;ee the <HI>Light;</HI> and cures all the Di&s;orders

<P>11. BUT if the De&s;ire of <HI>Po&s;terity,</HI> &s;o na|tural
to young-married Women, &s;hould not
prevail with them to enter upon this cool,
&s;oft, whol&s;ome <HI>Regimen,</HI> I mean a <HI>total
<PB N="288" REF="304">
Milk and Seed Diet;</HI> yet there is one Argu|ment
which I think could not fail in that
<HI>Sex,</HI> which is, that I can a&s;&s;ure them upon
my <HI>Credit</HI> and <HI>Veracity,</HI> that it is the only
Method known or knowable to Mankind, to
pre&s;erve and improve the <HI>Beauty, Cleanne&s;s</HI>
and <HI>Sweetne&s;s,</HI> of the <HI>Tender</HI> and <HI>Delicat,</HI> far
beyond <HI>Quick&s;ilver,</HI> which the Mothers of the
<HI>Georgian</HI> Daughters give them, to improve their
<HI>Beauty,</HI> for a long time, before they enter in
the <HI>Seraglio's</HI> of the great Men of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI>
The&s;e young Ladies, who are &s;o anxious to
pre&s;erve their <HI>Faces, Complexions</HI> and <HI>Shape,</HI>
that they often endanger their <HI>Healths</HI> and
<HI>Lives</HI> on that <HI>Score,</HI> will find this <HI>Regimen</HI>
far beyond the <HI>Paint</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h Ro&ugrave;ge</HI> and
Colouring, (which always at la&s;t de&s;troys the De|licacy
of the Skin, and the natural Beauty) and
yet is &s;o univer&s;ally practis'd now for that End.
<HI>Scorbutical, Icteric,</HI> and <HI>Biliary</HI> Con&s;titutions,
may for a while look <HI>pale, languid,</HI> and <HI>&s;allow,</HI>
under &s;uch a <HI>Regimen;</HI> but in time all the&s;e
mortifying <HI>Symptoms</HI> will evani&s;h, and an ini|mitable
<HI>Bloom, Blu&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Brightne&s;s,</HI> will &s;uc|ceed,
infinitly beyond all the Colouring of
<HI>Art</HI> or <HI>Paint.</HI> There is no Beauty like the
<HI>Bloom</HI> of Nature in perfect Health: Such a
<HI>Regimen</HI> duely continued, heightens the <HI>Scar|let</HI>
of the Blood, &s;weetens and thins it, &s;o that it
is able to <HI>circulat</HI> freely through the <HI>tran&s;parent
Scarf-Skin</HI> in its lea&s;t and la&s;t <HI>Capillaries</HI> and

of the fine&s;t Women in <HI>England.</HI> But they
mu&s;t not be di&s;couraged, if upon &s;hort <HI>Trials</HI>
the Effect is not produced, for at fir&s;t it may
happen quite otherwi&s;e: But let them have
but Patience and Per&s;everance, I will venture
my <HI>Fortune</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> on the Succe&s;s at la&s;t.

<PB N="290" REF="306">
violent Exerci&s;e, and every Exce&s;s of any
Kind, it would help her much, if &s;he lo&s;t
about two, at mo&s;t three Ounces of Blood
at the Arm, near about the time &s;he u&s;ed to be
out of Order, at lea&s;t for the fir&s;t three, or
four, or five Months, after &s;he has rea&s;on to be|lieve

by which &s;o &s;afe and &s;mall a Lo&s;s of

will be abated, and a Mi&s;carriage prevented:
But Care &s;hould be had, that this &s;mall <HI>Phle|botomy</HI>
be not carried on after the fifth
Month; for then the Danger of <HI>Mi&s;carriage</HI>
le&s;&s;ens, unle&s;s it be by Accidents.</P>
<P>13. YOUNG married Women, on breed|ing,
generally after mi&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t <HI>Return,</HI>
are very apt to turn &s;icki&s;h in a Morning,
<HI>reach,</HI> and throw up wateri&s;h <HI>Phlegm</HI> and
<HI>Choler,</HI> e&s;pecially if they have been plenti|ful
and free Feeders, which often forces an
<HI>Abortion.</HI> I know no Remedy &s;o effectual
for this, as the <HI>Thumb-Vomit</HI> above de&s;cribed,
which, without Violence, di&s;charges the Sto|mach
of this &s;uperabundant <HI>Phlegm</HI> and
<HI>Choler,</HI> and ought to be daily, and every

Half an Hour after, drinking a &s;mall Gla&s;s of
tepid fre&s;h <HI>Spa-water,</HI> with ten Drops of

<P>14. A <HI>TEA</HI> made of <HI>Je&s;uits-Bark, Mi&s;leto,
Orange-peel</HI> and <HI>Cinamon,</HI> on <HI>Bri&s;tol-water,</HI>
three, four, or five Spoonfuls of this, taken two

eighteen Ounces of <HI>French</HI> White-wine,
&s;train'd and filtred, four Spoonfuls, more or
le&s;s, as it operats downwards, is an excellent
Remedy, taken every other Night, both again&s;t
the Sickne&s;s incident to <HI>breeding</HI> Women, and
al&s;o again&s;t Abortion, and prevents too ob|&s;tinat

Back, a broad <HI>Girdle</HI> of Cotton applied about
the Middle, good Hours, chearful Company,
and, in a Word, every thing that is proper to
promote Health and good Spirits, ought to
be attended to, by tender and delicat Breeders;
<PB N="292" REF="308">
for one <HI>Mi&s;carriage</HI> hurts the Con&s;titution,
and weakens the <HI>Nerves,</HI> more than two full
Births.</P>
<P>16. IT is a <HI>vulgar Error</HI> to confine tender
breeding Women to their <HI>Chambers, Couches,</HI>
or <HI>Beds,</HI> dureing all the Time of their <HI>Preg|nancy.</HI>
This is one of the readie&s;t ways to
make them <HI>mi&s;carry;</HI> it is like the common
Advice of &s;ome unskilful Per&s;ons, to &s;uch as
have <HI>ana&s;arcous</HI> or <HI>drop&s;ical</HI> Legs, <HI>viz.</HI> to
keep them up in Chairs on a Level with their
Seats, which is the ready way to throw up
the Humours into their Bowels, and fix them
there. The only &s;olid and certain way to
prevent <HI>Mi&s;carriage,</HI> is to pur&s;ue all tho&s;e
<HI>Means</HI> and <HI>Methods</HI> that are the likelie&s;t to
procure or promote good Health, of which

but fre&s;h <HI>Air,</HI> gentle <HI>Exerci&s;e,</HI>
walking, being carried in a <HI>Sedan</HI> or <HI>Chai&s;e,</HI>
on even Ground, is as nece&s;&s;ary as <HI>Food</HI> or
<HI>Re&s;t;</HI> and therefore is never to be omitted,
when the Sea&s;on will permit, by tender
Breeders. If the&s;e Rules, judiciou&s;ly applied,

<P>1. AS there are few <HI>Individuals,</HI> who
have not &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to con|clude,
that at about the Age of Forty-five, or
Fifty, they have pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life,
and are &s;tepping <HI>down Hill;</HI> the whole Space
of Time (be it more or le&s;s) which is allotted
to them between <HI>this</HI> Sea&s;on of Life and the
Hour of Death, will, by a rea&s;onable think|ing
Man, be called <HI>Old Age.</HI> It is, as it
were, the <HI>Twilight</HI> of Life, or a <HI>&s;econd Child|hood,</HI>
with this e&s;&s;ential Difference however,
from the <HI>fir&s;t Infancy,</HI> that in <HI>This</HI> the <HI>Fa|culties</HI>
and their <HI>material Organs</HI> are uncul|tivated,
unextended, and want their <HI>Per|fection;</HI>
whereas in this <HI>Second,</HI> the <HI>Facul|ties</HI>
and the <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> likewi&s;e may, by a wi&s;e
and prudent <HI>Oeconomy,</HI> be &s;upported to the
very la&s;t Stage of Life, in <HI>Vigour</HI> propor|tionat
to their earlier <HI>Cultivation</HI> and Im|provement;
and hence it is, that I call <HI>Old
Age</HI> the <HI>Twilight</HI> or <HI>Evening</HI> of <HI>Life;</HI> and,
to carry on the <HI>Metaphor,</HI> I further ob&s;erve,
that if the earlier Years have been &s;pent in
<HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Innocence,</HI> this <HI>Evening,</HI> like
that of a <HI>Summer's</HI> Day, will be calm and
<PB N="294" REF="310">
&s;erene, nay &s;weeter and more delightful than
the precedeing <HI>Day.</HI></P>
<P>2. WERE our Views to be carried no
further than the narrow <HI>Circle</HI> of &s;eventy or
eighty Years, this Calmne&s;s, this <HI>Serenity,</HI> &s;o
much to be wi&s;hed for, would &s;urely invite
every thinking Man, who had his own <HI>Hap|pine&s;s</HI>
in View, to &s;tep forward in that <HI>Path</HI>
of Life which Nature it&s;elf has evidently
pointed out to him; and if we carry our
<HI>Ideas</HI> beyond this narrow <HI>Circle,</HI> and con|templat
a <HI>future Exi&s;tence,</HI> is it not <HI>Mad|ne&s;s</HI>
to deviat from a <HI>Path</HI> which leads to
an happy <HI>Eternity?</HI></P>
<P>3. THE irk&s;ome Experience which I have
had of Multitudes of thoughtle&s;s unhappy <HI>In|dividuals,</HI>
who by their Folly and Luxury have
weakened the <HI>primary Powers</HI> of Nature in
their own Con&s;titutions, who without any &s;e|vere
<HI>Chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers or Accidents have, as
it were, wilfully made them&s;elves wretched,
is a &s;ufficient <HI>Call</HI> to me, to point out to my

pre&s;erving Health in the <HI>Decline</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> a

4. NOW one of the mo&s;t effectual Me|thods
which a wi&s;e Man can pur&s;ue, in order
to obtain the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of what I call a <HI>Green
Old Age,</HI> is to begin at lea&s;t at the Age of
Fifty, to le&s;&s;en his daily Su&s;tenance of <HI>Meat</HI>
and <HI>Drink,</HI> both in <HI>Quantity</HI> and <HI>Quality,</HI>
but e&s;pecially in the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> I have, in my
<HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> on <HI>Regimen,</HI> demon&s;trated that about
this Time the great <HI>Cri&s;e</HI> or <HI>Climacteric</HI> of
Life generally happens in both <HI>Sexes.</HI> Then
it is, that the Blood and the Juices of the
mo&s;t Healthy and Strong begin to <HI>cool,</HI> to
<HI>thicken,</HI> to become <HI>vapid,</HI> and to be <HI>ob|&s;tructed</HI>
in the <HI>Capillaries</HI> and <HI>Lymphatics;</HI>
many of which Ve&s;&s;els, by &s;uch <HI>Ob&s;tructions,</HI>
coale&s;ce and become <HI>cartilaginous,</HI> the
<HI>Per&s;piration</HI> is le&s;&s;ened, all the &s;everal <HI>Se|cretions</HI>
are rendered le&s;s <HI>perfect,</HI> all the
<HI>Solids</HI> grow &s;tiff and hard, and lo&s;e their
<HI>Ela&s;ticity,</HI> and the <HI>Circulation</HI> is gradually
reduced into a narrower Compa&s;s, approach|ing
&s;till nearer and nearer to the <HI>Trunks</HI> of
the Blood-ve&s;&s;els, or their fir&s;t Branches.</P>
<P>5. AT this Time it is, that an ob&s;ervant
<HI>wi&s;e Man</HI> will di&s;cover, that his <HI>Vigour</HI> is
pa&s;t the <HI>Meridian,</HI> and begins to <HI>decline;</HI> and
this Di&s;covery will <HI>dictate</HI> to him a Nece&s;&s;ity
of takeing &s;uch Mea&s;ures, as may render the
<HI>Progre&s;s</HI> of <HI>Old Age</HI> as <HI>&s;low</HI> as his Nature
will admit of; and &s;uch as may contribute
<PB N="296" REF="312">

and the Pre&s;ervation of his <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> and
his <HI>Faculties,</HI> in all the Perfection that can rea|&s;onably
be hoped for.</P>
<P>6. NOW I am per&s;uaded, this de&s;ireable
<HI>End</HI> cannot, by human Means, be attained,
without a gradual Diminution of his <HI>Meat</HI>
and <HI>Drink,</HI> and this both in <HI>Quantity</HI> and
<HI>Quality,</HI> e&s;pecially in the <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> and this is a
Rule which mu&s;t be practi&s;ed by the Man
who is turned of Fifty, and is de&s;irous of
living to Seventy or Eighty. It mu&s;t be
&s;trictly and uniformly pur&s;ued, and he mu&s;t
re&s;olve to be deaf to the <HI>Calls</HI> of craving Ap|petites,
which, at this Time in Life, are u&s;u|ally
&s;o depraved by <HI>Prejudice, Example,</HI> and
<HI>Exce&s;s,</HI> that their Judgment is <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> and
their Dictates <HI>de&s;tructive,</HI> when they point

perfect State of Health, and was at the &s;ame
time happy in <HI>high Spirits</HI> to the Age of
an Hundred, or, as &s;ome Authors &s;ay, an
Hundred and Twenty: A very extraordinary
In&s;tance this, in a Man of <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s <HI>Rank</HI> in
<HI>Life,</HI> who had in his Youth indulged in <HI>high</HI>
Food, and <HI>rich</HI> Wine. Now it is highly pro|bable,
that from the Time of the fir&s;t Re|duction
of his Food &s;o, at the Age of Forty,
he mu&s;t gradually have le&s;&s;ened the daily
<HI>Quantity,</HI> about two Ounces every ten Years,
till he had at Length reduced it to an Ounce
a Day. The happy Re&s;ult of this gradual
<HI>Reduction</HI> &s;hews, that he mu&s;t naturally have
had very &s;trong Solids: For I am quite per|&s;uaded,
that if in&s;tead of this <HI>&s;tinted</HI> Quan|tity
of <HI>animal</HI> Food, he had, at the Age of
Forty, confined him&s;elf to Cow's Milk and
Bread, to Vegetables and Water only, he
might probably have lived to a much greater
Age, with a clearer <HI>Head,</HI> and higher <HI>Spirits;</HI>
for the &s;overeign Method of prolonging Life
is to pre&s;erve the Blood in a <HI>thin, &s;weet</HI> and
<HI>balmy</HI> State, by which only the <HI>Circulation</HI>
can be kept &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive and full,
through the various <HI>Meanders</HI> of the <HI>Capil|laries,</HI>
<PB N="298" REF="314">
and all their delicat <HI>Circumvolutions</HI> in
the <HI>Glands:</HI> For natural <HI>Death</HI> by rea&s;on of
Age only, is the nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;ult of thicken|ing
the Blood, which gradually le&s;&s;ens the Ex|tent
of, and finally &s;tops, the <HI>Circulation,</HI> even
in the Trunks of the Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>8. IT is now about &s;ixteen Years &s;ince, for
the la&s;t time, I entered upon a <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>ve|getable
Diet.</HI> At the Beginning of this Pe|riod,
this light Food I took as my Appetite
directed, without any Mea&s;ure, and found my|&s;elf
ea&s;y under it: After &s;ome time, I found it
became nece&s;&s;ary to le&s;&s;en the <HI>Quantity,</HI> and
I have laterly reduced it to One half at mo&s;t,
of what I at fir&s;t &s;eemed to bear; and if
it &s;hall plea&s;e GOD to &s;pare me a few Years
longer, in order to pre&s;erve in that Ca&s;e, that
<HI>Freedom</HI> and <HI>Clearne&s;s</HI> which by his <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI>
I now enjoy, I &s;hall probably find my&s;elf
obliged to deny my&s;elf <HI>One half</HI> of my pre|&s;ent
daily Su&s;tenance, which preci&s;ely is <HI>three
Winche&s;ter Pints</HI> of new Cow's Milk, and <HI>&s;ix
Ounces of Bi&s;cuit</HI> made of fine Flour without
<HI>Salt</HI> or <HI>Ye&s;t,</HI> and baked in a quick <HI>Oven.</HI></P>
<P>9. MODERAT <HI>Phlebotomies</HI> to &s;uch as
can bear them without Fainting or great
Lowne&s;s, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have ever by a
common temperat Diet pre&s;erved a robu&s;t
<HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> will greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t in procuring a
<HI>Green Old Age;</HI> for Death (as I have already
<PB N="299" REF="315">
ob&s;erved) overtakes the temperat Man <HI>lento
pede,</HI> by &s;low and gradual Advances, by
thickening from time to time the Juices, <HI>viz.</HI>
the <HI>Curd</HI> and <HI>Serum</HI> of the Blood, and there|by
ob&s;tructing fir&s;t the <HI>Capillaries</HI> and <HI>Lym|phatics,</HI>
and then the fir&s;t Branches, and
la&s;tly the <HI>Trunk</HI> Ve&s;&s;els them&s;elves. Now
moderat and frequent Lo&s;s of Blood keeps
the Ve&s;&s;els always <HI>roomy,</HI> and draws off more
of the thick and vi&s;cid Juices, and in a greater
Proportion than of the fluid and good Blood,
as I have before &s;hewn.</P>
<P>10. IF <HI>proper,</HI> light, and whol&s;ome Food,
&s;uch as is ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, be taken in the &s;malle&s;t
Quantities that can prevent the <HI>Anxiety</HI> of
Hunger, the kindly Chyle from thence drawn
will keep the whole Ma&s;s of Blood cool,
thin, and &s;weet, longer and better than any
other Method of <HI>Diet,</HI> which, in my Judg|ment,
Art can &s;ugge&s;t. Now in order to
render this <HI>Regimen</HI> ea&s;y and familiar to the
Patient, he &s;hould enter upon it at the Age
of Fifty, at lea&s;t before he is Sixty, that the
Change from higher Feeding may not be
attended with Fainting, or too great Low|ne&s;s.
I have at this time a Patient upwards
of Eighty, in perfect Health and Serenity,
who yet has ever been of a delicat and tender
Con&s;titution, who&s;e pre&s;ent ea&s;y and happy
State &s;eems to be the Con&s;equence of draw|ing
&s;even or eight Ounces of Blood about
<PB N="300" REF="316">
once in two or three Months; and. in Fact,
I have found, that frequent moderat <HI>Phlebo|tomies,</HI>
(for In&s;tance, once every Quarter of
a Year, or at lea&s;t in the Spring and at Au|tumn)
when they can be borne without Faint|ings
or &s;ub&s;equent Lowne&s;s of Spirits, will
greatly contribute to the Pre&s;ervation of Life,
and afford a rea&s;onable Pro&s;pect of a <HI>green</HI>
and <HI>&s;erene Old Age.</HI></P>
<P>11. ANOTHER Method of procureing
the&s;e <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> is to promote and encourage
<HI>Per&s;piration.</HI> Now in old Men, from the
Weakne&s;s and Slowne&s;s of Dige&s;tion, by a
Contraction of the <HI>Chanels</HI> for Circulation,
(many of the &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els becoming &s;olid)
and by a con&s;equential <HI>Laxity</HI> of all the <HI>mo|tive</HI>
Powers, the <HI>Per&s;piration</HI> gradually de|crea&s;es,
the Skin grows dry and &s;tiff, the <HI>per|&s;piratory</HI>
Ducts are clo&s;ed; and hence come
<HI>Wrinkles</HI> in the <HI>Skin,</HI> and <HI>Palene&s;s</HI> in the
Face. Now the Encouragement of <HI>Per&s;pira|tion</HI>
in every &s;afe and proper Way, is the
mo&s;t likely Method of preventing (or at lea&s;t
of retarding) the&s;e Effects of <HI>Age;</HI> and this
may be done by frequent and powerful <HI>Fric|tion</HI>
over the Body, the Limbs, and <HI>Spine,</HI>
(e&s;pecially in the Morning and at Night)
with a <HI>Fle&s;h-bru&s;h,</HI> a <HI>rough dry Towel,</HI> or a
Piece of warm <HI>Flanel,</HI> afterwards wa&s;hing,
in the warm Sea&s;ons, with a Towel wet in
cold Water, and in the colder Sea&s;ons, in
<PB N="301" REF="317">
<HI>warm</HI> Water. Let this be done before a clear
Fire, and let the Patient after &s;uch Opera|tion
put on a <HI>Cotton</HI> Wai&s;tcoat next to his
Skin. But nothing will &s;o effectually prevent
this, as a total Milk and Seed Diet.</P>
<P>12. As to Medicins, the be&s;t known to
me, as conducive towards a <HI>green Old Age,</HI>
are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> In cold Nights, half a Pint of
warm &s;mall Sack-whey, with forty or fifty
Drops of <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Hart&s;horn,</HI> taken at going
to Bed&mdash;a <HI>Pill,</HI> two or three, of true <HI>A&s;&s;a
foetida</HI> taken early in a Morning, the Effect
of which is to be felt the en&s;uing Night&mdash;
in want of due Re&s;t, <HI>the&s;e,</HI> or a Drachm of <HI>Mi|thridate,</HI>
or half a Drachm, or forty Grains of
old <HI>Venice Treacle,</HI> or Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s Cor|dial,
wa&s;h'd down with warm Sack-whey.</P>
<P>13. IT will be highly beneficial to u&s;e all
&s;uch bodily Exerci&s;e as a Man in Years can
with Safety bear; an Hor&s;e, whil&s;t his Strength
is equal to it; afterwards a <HI>Chai&s;e</HI> or <HI>Chariot,</HI>
in good Weather, or in bad let him walk an
Hour in the Morning, the &s;ame in the Even|ing
before Sun-&s;et, and let his Walk be taken
in a <HI>&s;heltered</HI> Place. Tho&s;e who are unequal
to the&s;e Exerci&s;es, may, however, u&s;e the
<HI>Tremou&s;&s;oir,</HI> (or Chamber-Hor&s;e) a <HI>dumb
Bell,</HI> or an <HI>Hammock:</HI> For Exerci&s;e, in &s;ome
Shape or other, mu&s;t be had; and this may
be adapted to the Time of Life, and the dif|ferent
Stages of a natural and nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Decay.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="318">
14. To promote the great Point in View,
a <HI>chearful healthy Old Age,</HI> nothing, in my
Judgment, can more effectually conduce,
than a &s;erious Attention to the gradual Ad|vancement
of the&s;e <HI>Stages</HI> in Life, and a pro|portionat
Regulation of Diet; and hence will
it be highly advi&s;eable to drop, by Degrees,
<HI>&s;olid</HI> Food, and to &s;lide into <HI>Liquids</HI> only.
The &s;tronger animal Food may, at fir&s;t, be &s;uc|ceeded
by weaker, &s;uch as <HI>Chicken</HI> and <HI>Veal.</HI>
The&s;e, in Proce&s;s of Time, mu&s;t give way to
thin <HI>Broths</HI> made of <HI>Vipers,</HI> with <HI>Veal</HI> or
<HI>Chicken;</HI> which mu&s;t at length be laid a&s;ide
for <HI>vegetable Soups,</HI> (made with little Butter)
and finally, half a Pint of <HI>A&s;s's Milk</HI> for
<HI>Breakfa&s;t,</HI> the &s;ame for <HI>Supper,</HI> and a Quart
of &s;weet <HI>Cow's Milk</HI> for Dinner, will, upon
Experience, be found to be a Diet calculated to
prolong Life, keep the <HI>Head</HI> clear, the <HI>Spirits</HI>
free, the Per&s;piration tolerably <HI>full,</HI> and Cir|culation
pretty exten&s;ive: And if this very
ab&s;temious <HI>Regimen</HI> is not &s;trictly pur&s;ued,
and craving Appetites mu&s;t have &s;ome Indul|gence;
in &s;uch Ca&s;e, the <HI>lighte&s;t</HI> and the
<HI>lea&s;t</HI> Food, which can prevent the Unea&s;ine&s;s
of <HI>Hunger,</HI> will be found to be a <HI>rational</HI>
and almo&s;t certain Method of procureing un|interrupted
Health, and a <HI>green Old Age.</HI></P>
<P>15. ANOTHER ea&s;y and efficacious Mean
of obtaining the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, is to go to Bed,
<PB N="303" REF="319">
and to ri&s;e from it, early; the fir&s;t by Eight
or Nine o'Clock in the Evening, the latter
by Six in the Morning, during the Summer
Sea&s;on, and at Seven in the Winter; and the
Prudence of &s;uch Practice will appear, when
it is con&s;idered, that at Night the Air is gene|rally
damp, heavy, full of <HI>nitrous, ar&s;enic</HI> and
noxious mineral Particles, which being <HI>&s;peci|fically</HI>
heavier than its other con&s;tituent Parts,
gravitat and de&s;cend the &s;oone&s;t towards the
Surface of the <HI>Earth,</HI> that is, in the fir&s;t Hours
of the Night; and from <HI>the&s;e,</HI> an early warm Bed
is the be&s;t Defence: Now before the <HI>Dawn</HI> of
Day, all this hurtful Matter is di&s;charged and
drops, and in the Place thereof the Air is im|pregnated
with <HI>bal&s;amic</HI> and fragrant Particles
drawn from the lighte&s;t and &s;weete&s;t Vege|tables;
and <HI>the&s;e,</HI> early-ri&s;ing Per&s;ons, of a
tender and delicat Frame, &s;hould &s;trive to
enjoy, whil&s;t they are hovering, as it were,
in the lower <HI>Regions,</HI> and before the Force
of the <HI>Sun</HI> has carried them out of their
Reach. Another beneficial Re&s;ult of early
Ri&s;ing is, that it affords Time &s;ufficient for the
bodily Exerci&s;es above &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>16. IT will be found nece&s;&s;ary for a Man
in Years, to endeavour to keep his Belly
<HI>firm,</HI> and its Dejections <HI>&s;olid</HI> and <HI>formed,</HI> as
a proper Means of pre&s;erving a due Tight|ne&s;s
in the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of the <HI>Solids</HI> and
the <HI>Nerves;</HI> and this can only be uniformly
<PB N="304" REF="320">
effected by very moderat Meals on the
lighte&s;t Food. Slipping Bowels in <HI>Old Age</HI>
will de&s;troy the Firmne&s;s of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> and
Freedom of the Spirits, and &s;oon bring on
Lowne&s;s and Sinking, peculiarly hurtful to
<HI>Old Age.</HI> This the wi&s;e <HI>Hippocrates</HI> well
knew, when he warmly recommended to
Men in Years a Firmne&s;s in the Bowels,
which I would advi&s;e as a very e&s;&s;ential Step
towards an healthy <HI>Old Age.</HI> Now when an
old Man, by endeavouring to pre&s;erve this
Firmne&s;s, finds that he becomes too <HI>co&s;tive,</HI>
and that his Head is thereby <HI>clouded,</HI> or his
Belly <HI>tumefied,</HI> (the u&s;ual Con&s;equence of Over|feeding
only) a &s;mall Quantity of <HI>Hiera
Picra,</HI> or <HI>Tincture of Rhubarb,</HI> one or two
<HI>Ruffi</HI> Pills, or <HI>Ander&s;on</HI>'s Pills, taken over
Night, will ea&s;ily remove &s;uch Unea&s;ine&s;s:
And be it remembered, that all the <HI>Openers</HI>
taken by <HI>old Men</HI> &s;hould be of the warmer
and more <HI>carminative</HI> Sort, becau&s;e the <HI>cooler,</HI>
more <HI>dra&s;tic,</HI> and quicker Purgers, are <HI>flatu|lent</HI>
and <HI>di&s;piriting,</HI> and after the U&s;e of &s;uch,
the Bowels are apt to continue for a con&s;i|derable
time in a loo&s;e, <HI>flabby</HI> State, a Con|&s;equence
to be e&s;pecially avoided by Men in
Years; whereas the warmer and more <HI>carmi|native</HI>
Openers leave the Belly tight and firm,
the moderat U&s;e of &s;uch neither hurts the
Appetite, nor &s;inks the <HI>Spirits,</HI> and the Fre|quency
of &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance will be found highly
beneficial in the <HI>Decline</HI> of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="321">
17. ONE of the mo&s;t irk&s;ome Con&s;e|quences
of old Age, is <HI>Wind</HI> and <HI>Flatulence,</HI>
&s;o pent up in the Bowels, that by rea&s;on of
a weak <HI>Dige&s;tion,</HI> and ob&s;tructed <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI>
the Patient has not Force to throw it off.
The mo&s;t &s;olid Cure of this Symptom is the
<HI>lighte&s;t</HI> Food, and the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> in Quantity, which
can &s;ecure him from the <HI>Anxiety</HI> of Hunger.
Milk and Seeds have le&s;s of this Kind of
<HI>Wind,</HI> than any other <HI>Eatables,</HI> and that
which they have is of a gentler and &s;weeter
Sort. I cannot &s;ay, that in the&s;e Oppre&s;&s;ions
by <HI>Wind,</HI> I ever ob&s;erved, any great Relief was
to be had by the u&s;e of <HI>Aromatics</HI> and <HI>Spices,</HI>
unle&s;s an <HI>Aloetic</HI> Opener was joined with
them: They only attenuat, and do not expel
Wind.</P>
<P>18. IN great <HI>Flatulence,</HI> and frequent
<HI>Eructations,</HI> nothing affords &s;o quick and
effectual a Relief as <HI>Ipecacuana,</HI> or <HI>Thumb-Vomits,</HI>
as the Patient can bear them, and as
the <HI>Exacerbations</HI> indicat, to pump up the
<HI>Wind,</HI> and force it upwards or downwards, or
through the <HI>per&s;piratory</HI> Pores. After &s;uch
Operations, a Gla&s;s of generous <HI>&s;piced Wine,</HI>
and at going to Re&s;t, or a &s;mall Quantity of
<HI>Hiera Picra,</HI> will have a good Effect; and after|wards
chewing half a Drachm of <HI>Bark</HI> on an
empty Stomach twice a Day, which will give
Strength to the dige&s;tive <HI>Organs</HI> and the <HI>Solids.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="322">
19. ANOTHER Mean conducive to an
healthy <HI>Old Age,</HI> is to keep the <HI>Feet</HI> and
<HI>Hands</HI> e&s;pecially, as warm as po&s;&s;ible, by
<HI>woollen Socks,</HI> and <HI>furred Gloves.</HI> The&s;e Parts
being furthe&s;t from the <HI>Heart,</HI> the Source and

fir&s;t warm them well before a clear Fire, or
<HI>bathe</HI> them in warm Water, otherwi&s;e will
his Sleep be &s;hort and interrupted; and in

warmed with a Pan of clear Coals, &s;prinkled

of his Bed, and a Fire burning all Night in

<P>20. HIS Bed-Chamber &s;hould be of a
<HI>Southern</HI> Expo&s;ure; if po&s;&s;ible, let it be well

perfectly <HI>&s;weet</HI> and clean, and this rather by
con&s;tantly <HI>rubbing,</HI> than by <HI>wa&s;hing.</HI></P>
<P>21. A MAN in Years &s;hould not choo&s;e

Man who is really poor, take care to avoid
the Inconveniencies of the Non-naturals; and
his very <HI>Poverty,</HI> by confining him to a low,
thin <HI>Diet,</HI> may probably procure for him the
Ble&s;&s;ing of long Life, and a <HI>Green Old Age.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude; I cannot but hope, that
Per&s;ons of <HI>all Ranks</HI> and Conditions may,
by a &s;erious Attention to the&s;e <HI>Rules,</HI> make
&s;ome Di&s;coveries, which may a&s;&s;i&s;t in con|veying
them, without violent <HI>Shocks,</HI> through
a State of <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> and <HI>Probation.</HI></P>
<P>25. I HAVE above ob&s;erved, that to pro|long
a <HI>Green Old Age,</HI> nothing was more
conducive than the Firmne&s;s of the Bowels,
and a due natural Co&s;tivene&s;s, at lea&s;t of
<HI>figur'd Stools;</HI> but &s;ince a <HI>Diarrhoea</HI> may hap|pen

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be very ju&s;tly and rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed,
that all, e&s;pecially duely cultivated or &s;en|&s;ible
<HI>Patients,</HI> already know and are convinced
(at lea&s;t in the main) of the <HI>general Truths</HI>
here laid down, about the <HI>Cure</HI> of <HI>Di&s;tempers.</HI>
Scarce an <HI>Apothecary's Apprentice,</HI> but can
tell, that proper <HI>Evacuations, mild Altera|tives,</HI>
and <HI>gentle Bracers,</HI> orderly pur&s;ued,
and duely continued, are the mo&s;t effectual
Means and Medicins to cure the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> of
the Body, and the <HI>Anxieties</HI> of the Mind,
that are the Con&s;equences of &s;uch bodily
Di&s;ea&s;es; and no con&s;idering Patient, but is
convinced, that if he could but moderat his
<HI>Appetites,</HI> and &s;tick to the <HI>Lighte&s;t</HI> and the
<HI>Lea&s;t</HI> he is tolerably ea&s;y under, he would in
time get rid of his <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> and <HI>Complaints;</HI>
that is, at lea&s;t, he could thereby &s;tarve them
away in time; &s;o that what I have &s;o &s;trenu|ou&s;ly
and perpetually inculcated about <HI>Ab&s;|tinence,</HI>
Fa&s;ting, or the <HI>Lighte&s;t</HI> and the
<HI>Lea&s;t,</HI> is all <HI>Labour in Vain,</HI> and mere <HI>jejune
Repetition.</HI> The <HI>&s;ole Que&s;tion</HI> in <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI> it
&s;eems, and which alone ought to be the Sub|ject
of a &s;en&s;ible <HI>Phy&s;ician's</HI> Study and <HI>In|quiry,</HI>
is, How, takeing Mankind and the
World as they actually are, with their pre&s;ent
<HI>Ignorance, Appetites, Pa&s;&s;ions, Luxury</HI> and
<HI>Intemperance,</HI> which they will not forego,
<PB N="313" REF="329">
even under the Terrors of eternal Puni&s;h|ments,
it is po&s;&s;ible to cure or relieve them
of their <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> and <HI>Complaints,</HI> the &s;oone&s;t
and mo&s;t effectually. Some from their <HI>Situ|ation</HI>
in Life, their <HI>Employments</HI> and other
Circum&s;tances, may find the <HI>Rules</HI> I have laid
down for the &s;o tedious Recovery of Health,
extremely inconvenient and difficult to pra|cti&s;e.
Others from the <HI>Violence</HI> and the pain|ful
<HI>Craveings</HI> of their Appetites, Pa&s;&s;ions, Ha|bits,
and the Cu&s;toms of the Country, will
be extremely aver&s;e to cure their Complaints
in the <HI>Manner</HI> I propo&s;e. To both &s;uch I
might ju&s;t as well have &s;aid nothing at all, as
to have recommended &s;o impracticable and
di&s;agreeable a Manner of <HI>Cure.</HI> To the&s;e,
all I have to an&s;wer, is, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> I have &s;ugge&s;ted
the mo&s;t effectual and quicke&s;t <HI>Remedies</HI> and
<HI>Medicins</HI> to me known, and cho&s;en after the
<HI>experimental Refu&s;al</HI> of a Thou&s;and others,
&s;aid to be of the &s;ame Intention, under the
pre&s;ent common <HI>Regimen,</HI> and fa&s;hionable
Manner of practi&s;eing Phy&s;ic; and &s;o have
an&s;wered the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Condition; but without
promi&s;eing a <HI>&s;olid</HI> and dureable <HI>Cure</HI> in &s;uch
Circum&s;tances. 2<HI>dly,</HI> That taking in all the
<HI>Conditions</HI> propo&s;ed, they make it an impo&s;|&s;ible
<HI>Problem;</HI> and with as much Rea&s;on
they might require the <HI>Quadrature</HI> of the
<HI>Circle</HI> in <HI>integral Numbers,</HI> or a <HI>perpetual
Motion. Health</HI> and <HI>Luxury</HI> are incompa|tible:
Strong Fibres and Nerves, and <HI>immo|derat
<PB N="314" REF="330">
Lechery,</HI> are <HI>contradictory.</HI> Long Life
and continued <HI>Intemperance,</HI> in the Nature
of Things, are impo&s;&s;ible. <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> under
&s;uch Conditions, by &s;trong and repeated <HI>Eva|cuations,</HI>
and violent <HI>A&s;tringents</HI> and <HI>Bracers</HI>
alternatly pre&s;cribed, may keep up the <HI>Pa|tient</HI>
for a while, but that even poorly and
precariou&s;ly; and at the &s;ame time, and by
the&s;e very Means, they precipitat the <HI>Pa|tient's
Fate.</HI> The Propo&s;ition I laid down
to my&s;elf to prove, was, That Men, in a
great mea&s;ure, had the <HI>total Cure,</HI> at lea&s;t a
great Degree of the <HI>Alleviation</HI> of their Mi|&s;eries,
in their own Power; all, but that one
of <HI>Hunger</HI> perhaps, or <HI>Simplicity</HI> of Diet,
which cannot come to any very painful <HI>Ex|treme</HI>
in this I&s;land. To <HI>bear</HI> and <HI>forbear,</HI> is
all that is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in this <HI>Life,</HI> to
make a Man tolerably ea&s;y; and his Pain and
Suffering cannot have ri&s;en to any <HI>great
Height,</HI> who will not &s;ubmit to this. I have
labour'd to &s;hew in this <HI>Treati&s;e,</HI> by going
through mo&s;t of the common Di&s;tempers,
<HI>Acute</HI> and <HI>Chronical, Epidemical</HI> and <HI>Ce|phalic,</HI>
the <HI>Evacuations, Alteratives,</HI> and
<HI>Bracers,</HI> proper to alleviat them, without any
Con&s;ideration of a particular <HI>Regimen;</HI> and
to extirpat them, have added the <HI>&s;pecific Re|gimen.</HI>
If this will not give Content, we
mu&s;t conclude from this Appearance, as it
nece&s;&s;arily follows from many others, that
<HI>Pains, Suffering,</HI> and <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="315" REF="331">
in the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> to make Men
virtuous, in order to become afterwards
happy; and that <HI>Omnipotence</HI> and <HI>Omni&s;ci|ence</HI>
has cho&s;en this <HI>Mean,</HI> as the mo&s;t effe|ctual
to bring them to this State at la&s;t. So
that all Endeavours, however <HI>rea&s;onable,</HI> to
&s;teer any other Cour&s;e, will be vain, till the
<HI>Sufferings</HI> are more <HI>exa&s;perated,</HI> as in the
<HI>torturing Engines</HI> there are requir'd a <HI>Turn</HI>
or two more of the <HI>Screws</HI> to make the Cri|minal
&s;peak <HI>out</HI> the Whole. For my own
Part, neither my <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> the natural
<HI>Tenderne&s;s</HI> of my <HI>Nerves,</HI> my <HI>Habitudes,</HI> nor
even my <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> would permit me to &s;ee
my Fellow-Creatures in <HI>Pain</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI>
without contributeing all in my Power to
their <HI>Relief.</HI> Ab&s;olute <HI>Re&s;ignation,</HI> nay in|ward
Contentment and Joy, in the infinitly
wi&s;e and perfect Will of GOD in all things,
<HI>pro&s;perous</HI> or <HI>adver&s;e,</HI> I know is my <HI>Duty,</HI>
is a State I admire, and ought to <HI>a&s;pire</HI> after.
But I am &s;en&s;ible I am very far from it at
pre&s;ent, and I fear I could not be perfectly
happy in any <HI>Place,</HI> as I now feel my&s;elf, if
I certainly knew, that any of my Fellow-Crea|tures
were to be <HI>eternally</HI> mi&s;erable <HI>any|where.</HI>
I have therefore done my <HI>be&s;t,</HI> and I
believe my <HI>la&s;t,</HI> in <HI>Phy&s;ic:</HI> I think I have
<HI>demon&s;trated</HI> from the <HI>Nature</HI> of Things, from
the <HI>Writeings</HI> of &s;ome of the <HI>be&s;t Phy&s;icians,</HI>
my own <HI>long Experience,</HI> by running through
all the commonly de&s;cribed <HI>Di&s;tempers,</HI> that
<PB N="316" REF="332">
the Means and Methods I <HI>propo&s;e,</HI> will either
<HI>eradicat,</HI> or greatly <HI>relieve</HI> them; and though
the Method be <HI>&s;low,</HI> and &s;omewhat <HI>&s;elf-deny|ing,</HI>
yet <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> will make it &s;till ea&s;ier, and
the <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> ari&s;ing from it will
in time make it <HI>plea&s;ant;</HI> and in very bad
and painful Ca&s;es, it will be &s;ome <HI>Con&s;ola|tion,</HI>
and give the de&s;ponding Patient a great
deal of <HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> to <HI>know</HI> there is
&s;till a <HI>Method</HI> remaining, that has the greate&s;t
Probability to <HI>cure, relieve,</HI> or lay the &s;uffer|ing
Per&s;on ea&s;ily <HI>down,</HI> that has not yet been
commonly pre&s;cribed, nor &s;ufficiently en|forced:
For I am <HI>morally</HI> certain, and am
<HI>my&s;elf</HI> intirely convinced, that a <HI>Milk and
Seed,</HI> or <HI>Milk and Turnep</HI> Diet, duely per&s;i&s;ted
<HI>in,</HI> with the occa&s;ional Helps mentioned on
<HI>Exacerbations,</HI> will either <HI>totally cure,</HI> or
greatly <HI>relieve,</HI> every <HI>Chronical</HI> Di&s;temper I
ever &s;aw or read of; and plentiful <HI>Dilution,</HI>
(with proper Evacuation of the &s;everal kinds
premi&s;ed) with <HI>Teas</HI> made of the <HI>&s;aponaceous,</HI>
or <HI>aromatic Seeds,</HI> in their Order, will bid
faire&s;t to cure all cureable <HI>Acute</HI> ones I know.</P>
