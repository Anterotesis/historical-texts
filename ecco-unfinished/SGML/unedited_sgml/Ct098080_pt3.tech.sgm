<P>HOW different, my Rivers, is your
la&s;t letter from all your Emily
has ever yet received from you!
What have I done to de&s;erve &s;uch &s;u&s;pi|cions?
How unju&s;t are your &s;ex in all their
connexions with ours!</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
Do I not know love? and does this re|proach
come from the man on whom my
heart doats, the man, whom to make hap|py,
I would with. tran&s;port cea&s;e to live?
can you one moment doubt your Emily's
tenderne&s;s? have not her eyes, her air, her
look, her indi&s;cretion, a thou&s;and times
told you, in &s;pite of her&s;elf, the dear &s;e|cret
of her heart, long before &s;he was
con&s;cious of the tenderne&s;s of yours?</P>
<P>Did I think only of my&s;elf, I could live
with you in a de&s;art; all places, all &s;itua|tions
are equally charming to me, with
you: without you, the whole world af|fords
nothing which could give a mo|ment's
plea&s;ure to your Emily.</P>
<P>Let me but &s;ee tho&s;e eyes in which the
tendere&s;t love is painted, let me but hear
that enchanting voice, I am in&s;en&s;ible to all
el&s;e, I know nothing of what pu&s;&s;es around
me; all that has no relation to you pa&s;&s;es
away like a morning dream, the impre&s;&s;ion
of which is effaced in a moment: my ten|derne&s;s
<PB N="3" REF="5">
for you fills my whole &s;oul, and
leaves no room for any other idea. Rank,
fortune, my native country, my friends,
all are nothing in the balance with my
Rivers.</P>
<P>For your own &s;ake, I once more entreat
you to return to England: I will follow
you; I will &s;wear never to marry another;
I will &s;ee you, I will allow you to continue
the tender inclination which unites us.
Fortune may there be more favorable to
our wi&s;hes than we now hope; may join
us without de&s;troying the peace of the be&s;t
of parents.</P>
<P>But if you per&s;i&s;t, if you will &s;acrifice
every con&s;ideration to your tenderne&s;s&mdash;
My Rivers, I have no will but yours.</P>

My dear Bell,</OPENER>
<P>LUCY, being deprived of the plea&s;ure
of writing to you, as &s;he intended,
by Lady Anne Melville's dining with her,
de&s;ires me to make her apologies.</P>
<P>Allow me to &s;ay &s;omething for my&s;elf,
and to &s;hare my joy with one who will, I
am &s;ure, &s;o very &s;incerely &s;ympathize with
me in it.</P>
<P>I could not have believed, my dear Bell,
it had been &s;o very ea&s;y a thing to be
con&s;tant: I declare, but don't mention this,
le&s;t I &s;hould be laughed at, I have never
<PB N="5" REF="7">
felt the lea&s;t inclination for any other
woman, &s;ince I married your lovely friend.</P>
<P>I now &s;ee a circle of Beauties with the
&s;ame indifference as a bed of &s;nowdrops:
no charms affect me but hers; the whole
creation to me contains no other woman.</P>
<P>I find her every day, every hour, more
lovely; there is in my Lucy a mixture of
mode&s;ty, delicacy, vivacity, innocence, and
blu&s;hing &s;en&s;ibility, which add a thou&s;and
un&s;peakable graces to the mo&s;t beautiful
per&s;on the hand of nature ever formed.</P>
<P>There is no de&s;cribing her enchanting
&s;mile, the &s;mile of unaffected, artle&s;s ten|derne&s;s.
How &s;hall I paint to you the
&s;weet involuntary glow of plea&s;ure, the
kindling fire of her eyes, when, I approach;
or tho&s;e thou&s;and little dear at|tentions
of which love alone knows the value?</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
I never, my dear girl, knew happine&s;s
till now; my tenderne&s;s is ab&s;olutely a
&s;pecies of idolatry; you cannot think what
a &s;lave this lovely girl has made me.</P>
<P>As a proof of this, the little tyrant in&s;i&s;ts
on my omitting a thou&s;and civil things
I had to &s;ay to you, and attending her and
Lady Anne immediately to the opera; &s;he
bids me however tell you, &s;he loves you
<HI>pa&s;&s;ing the love of woman,</HI> at lea&s;t of hand|&s;ome
women, who are not generally cele|brated
for their candor and good-will to

<OPENER>To JOHN TEMPLE, E&s;&abque; Pall Mall.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>April 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<L>INDEED?</L>
<L>&startq;Is this that haughty, gallant, gay Lo|thario,</L>
<L>That dear per&s;idious&mdash;&endq;</L>
<P>Ab&s;olutely, my dear Temple, the &s;ex
ought never to forgive Lucy for daring
to monopolize &s;o very charming a fel|low.
I had &s;ome thoughts of a little
<HI>badinage</HI> with you my&s;elf, if I &s;hould re|turn
&s;oon to England; but I now give
up the very idea.</P>
<P>One thing I will, however, venture to
&s;ay, that love Lucy as much as you plea&s;e,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
you will never love her half &s;o well as &s;he
de&s;erves; which, let me tell you, is a great
deal for one woman, e&s;pecially, as you well
ob&s;erve, one hand&s;ome woman, to &s;ay of
another.</P>
<P>I am, however, not quite clear your
idea is ju&s;t: <HI>catti&s;m</HI> if I may be allowed
the expre&s;&s;ion, &s;eeming more likely to be
the vice of tho&s;e who are con&s;cious of
wanting them&s;elves the dear power of plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Hand&s;ome women ought to be, what I
profe&s;s my&s;elf, who am however only
pretty, too vain to be envious; and yet
we &s;ee, I am afraid, too often, &s;ome little
&s;parks of this mean pa&s;&s;ion between rival
Beauties.</P>
<P>Impartially &s;peaking, I believe the be&s;t
natured women, and the mo&s;t free from
envy, are tho&s;e who, without being very
hand&s;ome, have that <HI>je ne &s;&ccedil;ai quoi,</HI> tho&s;e
namele&s;s graces, which plea&s;e even without
<PB N="9" REF="11">
beauty; and who therefore, finding more
attention paid to them by men than their
looking-gla&s;s tells them they have a right
to expect, are for that rea&s;on. in con&s;tant
good humour with them&s;elves, and of
cour&s;e with every body el&s;e: whereas Beau|ties,
claiming univer&s;al empire, are at war
with all who di&s;pute their rights; that is,
with half the &s;ex.</P>
<P>I am very good-natured my&s;elf; but it
is, perhaps, becau&s;e, though a pretty
woman, I am more agreeable than hand|&s;ome,
and have an infinity of the <HI>je ne
&s;&ccedil;ai quoi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A propos,</HI> my dear Temple, I &s;o
plea&s;ed with what Monte&s;quieu &s;ays on
this &s;ubject, that I find it is not in my
nature to re&s;i&s;t tran&s;lating and in&s;erting
it; you cannot then &s;ay I have &s;ent you a
letter in which there is nothing worth reading.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">
I beg you will read this to the. mi&s;&s;es,
for which you cannot fail of their thanks,
and for this rea&s;on; there are perhaps a
dozen women in the world who do not
think them&s;elves hand&s;ome, but I will
venture to &s;ay, not one who does not
think her&s;elf agreeable, and that &s;he
has this namele&s;s charm, this &s;o much
talked of <HI>I know not what,</HI> which is, &s;o
much better than beauty. But to my
Monte&s;quieu:</P>
<P>&startq;There is &s;ometimes, both in per&s;ons
and things, an invi&s;ible charm, a natu|ral
grace, which we cannot define, and
which we are therefore obliged to call
the <HI>je ne &s;&ccedil;ai quoi.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It &s;eems to me that this is an effect
principally founded on &s;urprize.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We are touched that a per&s;on plea&s;es
us more than &s;he &s;eemed at fir&s;t to have
<PB N="11" REF="13">
a right to do; and we are agreeably
&s;urprized that &s;he &s;hould have known
how to conquer tho&s;e defects which
our eyes &s;hewed us, but which our
hearts no longer believe: 'tis for this
rea&s;on that women, who are not hand|&s;ome,
have often graces or agreeable|ne&s;&s;es;
and that beautiful ones very
&s;eldom have.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For a beautiful per&s;on does generally
the very contrary of what we expected;
&s;he appears to us by degrees le&s;s ami|able,
and, after having &s;urprized us
plea&s;ingly, &s;he &s;urprizes us in a con|trary
manner; but the agreeable im|pre&s;&s;ion
is old, the di&s;agreeable one
new: 'tis al&s;o &s;eldom that Beauties in|&s;pire
violent pa&s;&s;ions, which are almo&s;t
always re&s;erved for tho&s;e who have
graces, that is to &s;ay, agreeablene&s;&s;es,
which we did not expect, and which,
we had no rea&s;on to expect.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
&startq;Magnificent habits have &s;eldom grace,
which the dre&s;&s;es of &s;hepherde&s;&s;es often
have.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We admire the maje&s;ty of the dra|peries
of Paul Verone&s;e but we are
touched with the &s;implicity of Raphael,
and the exactne&s;s of Corregio.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Paul Verone&s;e promi&s;es much, and
pays all he promi&s;es; Raphael and Cor|regio
promi&s;e little, and pay much,
which plea&s;es us more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e graces, the&s;e agreeablene&s;&s;es,
are found oftener in the mind than
in the countenance: the charms of a
beautiful countenance are &s;eldom hidden,
they appear at fir&s;t view; but the mind
does not &s;hew it&s;elf except by degrees,
when it plea&s;es, and as much as it plea&s;es;
it can conceal it&s;elf in order to appear,
and give that &s;pecies of &s;urprize to
which tho&s;e graces, of which I &s;peak,
owe their exi&s;tence,&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">
&startq;This grace, this agreeablene&s;s, is le&s;s
in the countenance than in the manner;
the manner changes every in&s;tant, and
can therefore every moment give us
the plea&s;ure of &s;urprize: in one word,
a woman can be hand&s;ome but in one
way, but &s;he may be agreeable in a
hundred thou&s;and.&endq;</P>
<P>I like this doctrine of Monte&s;quieu's
extremely, becau&s;e it gives every woman
her chance, and becau&s;e it ranks me above
a thou&s;and hand&s;omer women, in the dear
power of in&s;piring pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Cruel creature! why did you give me
the idea of flowers? I now envy you your
foggy climate: the earth with you is at
this moment covered with a thou&s;and
lovely children of the &s;pring; with us, it
is an univer&s;al plain of &s;now.</P>
<P>Our beaux are terribly at a lo&s;s for
&s;milies: you have lillies of the valley for
compari&s;ons; we nothing but what with
<PB N="14" REF="16">
the idea of whitene&s;s gives that of cold|ne&s;s
too.</P>
<P>This is all the quarrel I have with Ca|nada:
the &s;ummer is delicious, the win|ter
plea&s;ant with all its &s;everities; but
alas! the &s;miling &s;pring is not here;

<P>AFTER my immen&s;e letter to your

<P>I am glad to find you manage Temple
&s;o admirably; the wi&s;e&s;t, the wilde&s;t, the

&s;laves, when we have proper ideas of pet|ticoat
politics.</P>
<P>I intend to compo&s;e a code of laws for

which I apprehend will be of infinite be|nefit
to the world.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
Do you know I am a greater fool than
I imagined? You may remember I was
always extremely fond of &s;weet waters.
I left them off lately, upon an idea,
though a mi&s;taken one, that Fitzgerald
did not like them: I ye&s;terday heard him
&s;ay the contrary; and, without thinking
of it, went mechanically to my dre&s;&s;ing|room,

give way to it.</P>
<P>It is divinely warm to-day, though the

confined for at lea&s;t a week, and Emily
not with me: I die for amu&s;ement. Fitz|gerald

<P>&startq;TIS indeed, my Lord, an advantage
for which we cannot be too thank|ful
to the Supreme Being, to be born in
a country who&s;e religion and laws are
<PB N="19" REF="21">
&s;uch, as would have been the objects of
our wi&s;hes, had we been born in any
other.</P>
<P>Our religion, I would be under&s;tood to
mean Chri&s;tianity in general, carries in|ternal
conviction by the excellency of its
moral precepts, and its tendency to make
mankind happy; and the peculiar mode
of it e&s;tabli&s;hed in England breathes be|yond
all others the mild &s;pirit of the
Go&s;pel, and that charity which embraces
all mankind as brothers.</P>
<P>It is equally free from enthu&s;ia&s;m and
&s;uper&s;tition; its outward form is decent
and. re&s;pectful, without affected o&s;tenta|tion;
and what &s;hews its excellence
above all others is, that every other
church allows it to be the be&s;t, except
it&s;elf: and it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, that
he has an undoubted right to the fir&s;t
rank of merit, to whom every man allows
the &s;econd.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">
As to our government, it would be
impertinent to prai&s;e it; all mankind al|low
it to be the ma&s;ter-piece of human
wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>It has the advantage of every other
form, with as little of their inconvenien|ces
as the imperfection attendant on all
human inventions will admit: it has the
monarchic quickne&s;s of execution and
&s;tability, the ari&s;tocratic diffu&s;ive &s;trength
and wi&s;dom of coun&s;el, the democra|tic
freedom and equal di&s;tribution of
property.</P>
<P>When I mention equal di&s;tribution of
property, I would not be under&s;tood to
mean &s;uch an equality as never exi&s;ted,
nor can exi&s;t but in idea; but that gene|ral,
that comparative equality, which
leaves to every man the ab&s;olute and
&s;afe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fruits of his labors;
which &s;oftens offen&s;ive di&s;tinctions, and
curbs pride, by leaving every order of
men in &s;ome degree dependent on the

other; and admits of tho&s;e gentle and

<P>The prince is here a centre of union;
an advantage, the want of which makes
a democracy, which is &s;o beautiful in

<P>WE are returned, my Lord, from
having &s;een an object as beautiful
and magnificent in it&s;elf, as plea&s;ing from
the idea it gives of renewing once more
our intercour&s;e with Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">
Before I &s;aw the breaking up of the
va&s;t body of ice, which forms what is
here called <HI>the bridge,</HI> from Quebec to
Point Levi, I imagined there could be
nothing in it worth attention; that the
ice would pa&s;s away, or di&s;&s;olve gradually,
day after day, as the influence of the &s;un,
and warmth of the air and earth increa&s;|ed;
and that we &s;hould &s;ee the river open,
without having ob&s;erved by what degrees
it became &s;o.</P>
<P>But I found <HI>the great river,</HI> as the &s;a|vages
with much propriety call it, main|tain
its dignity in this in&s;tance as in all
others, and a&s;&s;ert its &s;uperiority over tho&s;e
petty &s;treams which we honor with the
names of rivers in England. Sublimity
is the characteri&s;tic of this we&s;tern world;
the loftine&s;s of the mountains, the gran|deur
of the lakes and rivers, the maje&s;ty
of the rocks &s;haded with a pictureique
variety of beautiful trees and &s;hrubs, and
crowned with the noble&s;t of the offspring
<PB N="24" REF="26">
of the fore&s;t, which form the banks of
the latter, are as much beyond the power
of fancy as that of de&s;cription: a land|&s;cape-painter
might here expand his ima|gination,
and find ideas which he will
&s;eek in vain in our comparatively little
world.</P>
<P>The object of which I am &s;peaking has
all the American magnificence.</P>
<P>The ice before the town, or, to &s;peak in
the Canadian &s;tile, <HI>the bridge,</HI> being of a
thickne&s;s not le&s;s than five feet, a league
in length, and more than a mile broad,
re&s;i&s;ts for a long time the rapid tide that
attempts to force it from the banks.</P>
<P>We are prepared by many previous cir|cum&s;tances
to expect &s;omething extraordi|nary
in this event, if I may &s;o call it:
every increa&s;e of heat in the weather for
near a month before the ice leaves the
<PB N="25" REF="27">
banks; every warm day. gives you terror
for tho&s;e you &s;ee venturing to pa&s;s it in
carrioles; yet one fro&s;ty night makes it
again &s;o &s;trong, that even the ladies, and
the timid among&s;t them, &s;till venture
them&s;elves over in parties of plea&s;ure;
though greatly alarmed at their return,
if a few hours of uncommon warmth in|tervene.</P>
<P>But, during the la&s;t fortnight; the alarm
grows indeed a very &s;erious one: the eye
can di&s;tingui&s;h, even at a con&s;iderable
di&s;tance, that the ice is &s;oftened and
detached from the banks; and you dread
every &s;tep being death to tho&s;e who, have
&s;till the temerity to pa&s;s it, which they
will continue always to do till one or more
pay their ra&s;hne&s;s with their lives.</P>
<P>From the time the ice is no longer ***
bridge on which you &s;ee crowds driving
with &s;uch vivacity on bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure,
every one is looking eagerly for its break|ing
away, to remove the bar to the conti|nually
<PB N="26" REF="28">
wi&s;hed and expected event, of the
arrival of &s;hips from that world from
whence we have &s;eemed &s;o long in a man|ner
excluded.</P>
<P>The hour is come; I have been with a
crowd of both &s;exes, and all ranks, hail|ing
the propitious moment: our &s;ituation,
on the top of Cape Diamond, gave us a
pro&s;pect &s;ome leagues above and below
the town; above Cape Diamond the river
was open, it was &s;o below Point Levi,
the rapidity of the current having forced
a pa&s;&s;age for the water under the tran&s;pa|rent
bridge, which for more than a league continued firm.</P>
<P>We &s;tood waiting with all the eagerne&s;s
of expectation; the tide came ru&s;hing
with an amazing impetuo&s;ity; the bridge
&s;eemed to &s;hake, yet re&s;i&s;ted the force of
the waters; the tide recoiled, it made a
pau&s;e, it &s;tood &s;till, it returned with re|doubled
fury, the immen&s;e ma&s;s of ice gave way.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29">
A va&s;t plain appeared in motion; it ad|vanced
with &s;olemn and maje&s;tic pace: the
points of land on the banks of the river
for a few moments &s;topped its progre&s;s;
but the immen&s;e weight of &s;o prodigious
a body, carried along by a rapid current,
bore down all oppo&s;ition with a force
irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>There is no de&s;cribing how beautiful
the opening river appears, every moment
gaining on the &s;ight, till, in a time le&s;s
than can po&s;&s;ibly be imagined, the ice
pa&s;&s;ing Point Levi, is hid in one moment
by the projecting land, and all is once
more a clear plain before you; giving
at once the plea&s;ing, but unconnected,
ideas of that direct intercour&s;e with Europe
from which we have been &s;o many months
excluded, and of the earth's again open|ing
her fertile bo&s;om, to fea&s;t our eyes and
imagination with her various verdant and
flowery productions.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">
I am afraid I have conveyed a very in|adequate
idea of the &s;cene which has ju&s;t

<DATE>April 22.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>CERTAINLY, my dear, you are
&s;o far right; a nun may be in many
re&s;pects a le&s;s unhappy being than &s;ome
women who continue in the world; her
&s;ituation is, I allow, paradi&s;e to that of a
married woman, of &s;en&s;ibility and honor,
who di&s;likes her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The cruelty therefore of &s;ome parents
here, who &s;acrifice their children to ava|rice,
in forcing or &s;educing them into
convents, would appear more &s;triking, if
we did not &s;ee too many in England guilty
of the &s;ame inhumanity, though in a dif|ferent
manner, by marrying them again&s;t
their inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">
Your letter reminds me of what a
French married lady here &s;aid to me on
this very &s;ubject: I was exclaiming vio|lently
again&s;t convents; and particularly
urging, what I thought unan&s;werable, the
extreme hard&s;hip of one circum&s;tance;
that, however unhappy the &s;tate was
found on trial, there was no retreat; that
it was <HI>for life.</HI></P>
<P>Madame De&mdash;turned quick, &startq;And
is not marriage for life?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;True, Madam; and, what is wor&s;e,
without a year of probation. I confe&s;s
the force of your argument.&endq;</P>
<P>I have never dared &s;ince to mention
convents before Madame De&mdash;.</P>
<P>Between you and I, Lucy, it is a little
unrea&s;onable that people will come toge|ther
entirely upon fordid principles, and
then wonder they are not happy: in de|licate
<PB N="31" REF="33">
minds, love is &s;eldom the con&s;e|quence
of marriage.</P>
<P>It is not ab&s;olutely certain that a mar|riage
of which love is the foundation will
be happy; but it is infallible, I believe,
that no other can be &s;o to &s;ouls capable
of tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Half the world, you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve,
have no &s;ouls; at lea&s;t none but
of the vegetable and animal kinds: to this
&s;pecies of beings, love and &s;entiment are
entirely unnece&s;&s;ary; they were made to
travel through life in a &s;tate of mind nei|ther
quite awake nor a&s;leep; and it is
perfectly equal to them in what company
they take the journey.</P>
<P>You and I, my dear, are &s;omething
<HI>awakened;</HI> therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary we
&s;hould love where we marry, and for this
rea&s;on: our &s;ouls, being of the active
kind, can never be totally at re&s;t; there|fore,
if we were not to love our hu&s;bands.
<PB N="32" REF="34">
we &s;hould be in dreadful danger, of loving
&s;omebody el&s;e.</P>
<P>For my part, whatever tall maiden
aunts and cou&s;ins may &s;ay of the inde|cency
of a young woman's di&s;tingui&s;hing
one man from another, and of love coming
after marriage; I think marrying, in that
expectation, on &s;ober prudent principles,
a man one di&s;likes, the mo&s;t deliberate
and &s;hameful degree of vice of which the
human mind is capable.</P>
<P>I cannot help ob&s;erving here, that the
great aim of modern education &s;eems
to be, to eradicate the be&s;t impul&s;es of
the human heart, love, friend&s;hip, com|pa&s;&s;ion,
benevolence; to de&s;troy the
&s;ocial, and encrea&s;e the &s;elfi&s;h principle.
Parents wi&s;ely attempt to root out tho&s;e
affections which &s;hould only be directed
to proper objects, and which Heaven
gave us as the means of happine&s;s; not
con&s;idering that the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch an at|tempt
is doubtful; and that, if they &s;ucceed,
<PB N="33" REF="35">
they take from life all its &s;weetne&s;s,
and reduce it to a dull unactive round of
ta&s;tele&s;s days, &s;carcely rai&s;ed, above vege|tation.</P>
<P>If my ideas of things are right, the hu|man
mind is naturally virtuous; the bu|&s;ine&s;s
of education is therefore le&s;s to give
us good impre&s;&s;ions, which we have from
nature, than to guard us again&s;t bad
ones, which are generally acquired.</P>

<P>THE plea&s;ure the mind finds in travel|ling,
has undoubtedly, my Lord, its
&s;ource in that love of novelty, that delight
in acquiring new ideas, which is interwoven
in its very frame, which &s;hews it&s;elf on
every occa&s;ion from infancy to age, which
is the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion of the human mind,
and the la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38">
There is nothing the mind of man ab|hors
&s;o much as a &s;tate of re&s;t: the great
&s;ecret of happine&s;s is to keep the &s;oul in
continual action, without tho&s;e violent
exertions, which wear out its powers,
and dull its capacity of enjoyment;
it &s;hould have exerci&s;e, not labor.</P>
<P>Vice may ju&s;tly be called the fever
of the &s;oul, inaction its lethargy; pa&s;|&s;ion,
under the guidance of virtue, its
health.</P>
<P>I have the plea&s;ure to &s;ee my daughter's
coquetry giving place to a tender affection
for a very worthy man, who &s;eems formed
to make her happy: his fortune is ea&s;y;
he is a gentleman, and a man of worth
and honor, and, what perhaps inclines me
to be more partial to him, of my own
profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I mention the la&s;t circum&s;tance in order
to introduce a reque&s;t that your Lord&s;hip
<PB N="37" REF="39">
would have the goodne&s;s to employ, that
intere&s;t for him in the purcha&s;e of a

offered to me; I am determined, as there
is no pro&s;pect of real duty, to quit the
army, and retire to that quiet which is &s;o
plea&s;ing at my time of life: I am pri|vately
in treaty with a gentleman for my
company, and propo&s;e returning to Eng|land
in the fir&s;t &s;hip, to give in my re&s;ignation:
in this point, as well as that of
&s;erving Mr. Fitzgerald, I &s;hall without
&s;cruple call upon your Lord&s;hip's friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>I have &s;ettled every thing with Fitz|gerald,
but without &s;aying a word to Bell;
and he is to &s;educe her into matrimony as
&s;oon as he can, without my appearing at
all intere&s;ted in the affair: he is to a&s;k my
con&s;ent in form, though we have already
&s;ettled every preliminary.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40">
All this, as well as my intention of
quitting the army, is yet a &s;ecret to my
daughter.</P>
<P>But to the que&s;tions your Lord&s;hip does
me the honor to a&s;k me in regard to the
Americans, I mean tho&s;e of our old colo|nies:

&s;agacity and addre&s;s; but in all
other re&s;pects I think naturally inferior
to the Europeans; as education does &s;o
much, it is however difficult to a&s;certain this.</P>
<P>I am rather of opinion they would not

a trade by which England was an im|men&s;e

enormou&s;ly rich We&s;t India planters were

<P>Every advantage you give the North

the paternal hive.</P>
<P>Taxing them immediately after their
trade is re&s;trained, &s;eems like drying up
the &s;ource, and expecting the &s;tream

<OPENER>To the Earl of&mdash;.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>May 5.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been conver&s;ing, if the expre&s;|&s;ion
is not improper when I have not
had an opportunity of &s;peaking a &s;yllable,
more than two hours with a French officer,
who has declaimed the whole time with the
mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing volubility, without utter|ing
one word which could either entertain
or in&s;truct his hearers; and even without
&s;tarting any thing that de&s;erved the name
of a thought.</P>
<P>People who have no ideas out of the
common road are, I believe, generally the
greate&s;t talkers, becau&s;e all their thoughts
are low enough for common conver&s;ation;
<PB N="44" REF="46">
whereas tho&s;e of more elevated under|&s;andings
have ideas which they cannot
ea&s;ily communicate except to per&s;ons of
equal capacity with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This might be brought as an argument
of the inferiority of womens under&s;tanding
to ours, as they are generally greater talk|ers,
if we did not con&s;ider the limited
and trifling educations we give them;
men, among&s;t other advantages, have that
of acquiring a greater variety as well as
&s;ublimity of ideas.</P>
<P>Women who have conver&s;ed much with
men are undoubtedly in. general the mo&s;t
plea&s;ing. companions; but this only &s;hews
of what they are capable when properly
educated, &s;ince they improve &s;o greatly by
that accidental and limited opportunity of
acquiring knowledge.</P>
<P>Indeed the two &s;exes are equal gainers,
by conver&s;ing with each other: there is a
<PB N="45" REF="47">
mutual de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, in a mixed con|ver&s;ation,
re&s;trained by politene&s;s, which
&s;ets every amiable quality in a &s;tronger
light.</P>
<P>Bred in ignorance from one age to
another, women can learn little of their
own &s;ex.</P>
<P>I have often thought this the rea&s;on
why officers daughters are in general more
agreeable than other women in an equal
rank of life.</P>
<P>I am almo&s;t tempted to bring Bell as
an in&s;tance; but I know the blindne&s;s
and partiality of nature, and therefore
check what paternal tenderne&s;s would
dictate.</P>
<P>I am &s;hocked at what your Lord&s;hip
tells me of Mi&s;s H&mdash;. I know her
imprudent, I believe her virtuous: a great
flow of &s;pirits has been ever hurrying her
<PB N="46" REF="48">
into indi&s;cretions; but allow me to &s;ay,
my Lord, it is particularly hard to fix the
character by our conduct, at a time of life
when we are not competent judges of
our own actions; and when the hurry and
vivacity of youth carries us to commit a
thou&s;and follies and indi&s;cretions, for
which we blu&s;h when the empire of rea&s;on
begins.</P>
<P>Inexperience and openne&s;s of temper
betray us in early life into improper con|nexions
and the very con&s;tancy, and no|blene&s;s
of nature, which characterize the
be&s;t hearts, continue the delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I know Mi&s;s H&mdash;perfectly; and am
convinced, if her father will treat her as a
friend, and with the indulgent tenderne&s;s
of affection endeavor to wean her from a
choice &s;o very unworthy of her, he will
infallibly &s;ucceed; but if he treats her
with har&s;hne&s;s, &s;he is lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="49">
He is too &s;tern in his behaviour, too
rigid in his morals: it is the intere&s;t
of virtue to be repre&s;ented as &s;he is,
lovely, &s;miling, and ever walking hand
in hand with plea&s;ure: we were formed
to be happy, and to contribute
to the happine&s;s of our fellow-creatures;
there are no real virtues but the &s;ocial
ones.</P>
<P>'Tis the enemy of human kind who has
thrown around us the gloom of &s;uper&s;ti|tion,
and taught that au&s;ierity and volun|tary
mi&s;ery is virtue.</P>
<P>If morali&s;ts would indeed improve hu|man
nature, they &s;hould endeavor to ex|pand,
not to contract the heart; they
&s;hould build their &s;y&s;tem on the pa&s;&s;ions
and affections, the only foundations of
the nobler virtues.</P>
<P>From the partial repre&s;entations of nar|row-minded
bigots, who paint the Deity
from their own gloomy conceptions, the
<PB N="48" REF="50">
young are too often frighted from the
paths of virtue; de&s;pairing of ideal per|factions,
they give up all virtue as unat|tainable,
and &s;tart a&s;ide from the road
which they fal&s;ely &s;uppo&s;e &s;trewed with
thorns.</P>
<P>I have &s;tudied the heart with &s;ome at|tention;
and am convinced every parent,
who will take the pains to gain his chil|drens
friend&s;hip, will for ever be the
guide and arbiter of their conduct: I
&s;peak from a happy experience.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all my daughter &s;ays

in, all my weakne&s;s if that name ought
to be given to a tenderne&s;s of which the
object is the mo&s;t exalted and worthy
of his &s;ex.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould not have
$oved you; the &s;oul that &s;poke in tho&s;e
eloquent eyes told me, the fir&s;t moment
we met, our hearts were formed for each
other; I &s;aw in that amiable counte|nance
a &s;en&s;ibility &s;imilar to my own,
but which I had till then fought in vain;
I &s;aw there tho&s;e benevolent &s;miles, which
<PB N="52" REF="54">
are the marks, and the emanations of
virtue; tho&s;e thou&s;and graces which
ever accompany a mind con&s;cious of its
own dignity, and &s;atisfied with it&s;elf;
in &s;hort, that mental beauty which is
the expre&s;s image of the Deity.</P>
<P>What defence had I again&s;t you, my
Rivers, &s;ince your merit was &s;uch that
my rea&s;on approved the weakne&s; of my
heart?</P>
<P>We have lo&s;t Madame Des Roches; we
were both in tears at parting; we em|braced,
I pre&s;&s;ed her to my bo&s;om: I
love her, my dear Rivers; I have an af|fection
for her which I &s;carce know how
to de&s;cribe. I &s;aw her every day, I
found infinite plea&s;ure in being with
her; &s;he talked of you, &s;he prai&s;ed you,
and my heart was &s;oothed; I however
found it impo&s;&s;ible to mention your
name to her; a re&s;erve for which I
cannot account; I found plea&s;ure in
looking at her from the idea that &s;he
<PB N="53" REF="55">
was dear to you, that &s;he felt for you
the tendere&s;t friend&s;hip: do you know I
think &s;he has &s;ome re&s;emblance of you?
there is &s;omething in her &s;mile, which
gives me an idea of you.</P>
<P>Shall I, however, own all my folly? I
never found this plea&s;ure in &s;eeing her
when you were pre&s;ent: on the contrary,
your attention to her gave me pain: I
was jealous of every look; I even &s;aw her
amiable qualities with a degree of envy,
which checked the plea&s;ure I &s;hould other|wi&s;e
have found in her conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>There is always, I fear, &s;ome inju&s;tice
mixed with love, at lea&s;t with love &s;o
ardent and tender as mine.</P>
<P>You, my Rivers, will however pardon
that inju&s;tice which is a proof of my ex|ce&s;s
of tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Madame Des Roches has promi&s;ed to
write to me: indeed I will love her; I will
<PB N="54" REF="56">
conquer this little remain of jealou&s;y, and
do ju&s;tice to the mo&s;t gentle and amiable
of women.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould I di&s;like her for &s;eeing you
with my eyes, for having a &s;oul who&s;e
feelings re&s;emble my own?</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved her voice is &s;oftened,
and trembles, like mine, when &s;he names
you.</P>
<P>My Rivers, you were formed to charm
the heart of woman; there is more plea|&s;ure
in loving you, even without the hope
of a return, than in the adoration of all
your &s;ex: I pity every woman who is &s;o
in&s;en&s;ible as to &s;ee you without tenderne&s;s.
This is the only fault I ever found in Bell
Fermor: &s;he has the mo&s;t lively friend|&s;hip
for you, but &s;he has &s;een you with|out
love. Of what materials mu&s;t her
heart be compo&s;ed?</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="57">
No other man can in&s;pire the &s;ame &s;en|timents
with my Rivers; no other man
can de&s;rve them: the delight of loving
you appears to me &s;o &s;uperior to all other
plea&s;ures, that, of all human beings, if
I was not Emily Montague, I would be
Madame Des Roches.</P>
<P>I blu&s;h for what I have written; yet
why blu&s;h for having a &s;oul to di&s;tingui&s;h
perfection, or why conceal the real feel|ings
of my heart?</P>
<P>I will never hide a thought from you;
you &s;hall be at once the confidant and the
dear object of my tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>In what words&mdash;my Rivers, you rule
every emotion of my heart; di&s;po&s;e as you
plea&s;e of your Emily: yet, if you allow
her to form a wi&s;h in oppo&s;ition to yours,
indulge her in the tran&s;port of returning
you to your friends: let her receive you
from the hands of a mother, whose happi|ne&s;s
you ought to prefer even to hers.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58">
Why will you talk of the mediocrity of
your fortune? have you not enough for
every real want? much le&s;s, with you,
would make your Emily ble&s;t: what have
the trappings of life to do with happi|ne&s;s?
'tis only &s;acrificing pride to love

<OPENER>To the Earl of&mdash;.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>May 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT were indeed, my Lord, to be wi&s;hed
that we had here &s;chools, at the ex|pence
of the public, to teach Engli&s;h to
the ri&s;ing generation: nothing is a &s;tronger
tie of brotherhood and affection, a greater
cement of union, than &s;peaking one com|mon
language.</P>
<P>The want of attention to this circum|&s;tance
has, I am told, had the wor&s;t effects
po&s;&s;ible in the province of New York,
where the people, e&s;pecially at a di&s;tance
from the capital, continuing to &s;peak
Dutch, retain their affection for their
ancient matters, and &s;till look on their
<PB N="58" REF="60">
Engli&s;h fellow &s;ubjects as &s;trangers and
intruders.</P>
<P>The Canadians are the more ea&s;ily to
be won to this, or whatever el&s;e their
own, or the general good requires, as
their noble&s;&s;e have the &s;tronge&s;t attac|hment
to a court, and that favor is the
great object of their ambition: were
Engli&s;h made by degrees the court
language, it would &s;oon be univer&s;ally
&s;poke.</P>
<P>Of the three great &s;prings of the human
heart, intere&s;t, plea&s;ure, vanity, the la&s;t
appears to me much the &s;tronge&s;t in the
Canadians; and I am convinced the mo&s;t
forcible tie their noble&s;&s;e have to France,
is their unwillingne&s;s to part with their
croix de St. Louis: might not therefore
&s;ome order of the &s;ame kind be in&s;tituted
for Canada, and given to all who have
the croix, on their &s;ending back the en&s;igns
they now wear, which are incon&s;i&s;tent
with their allegiance as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects?</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61">
Might not &s;uch an order be contriv|ed,
to be given at the di&s;cretion of the
governor, as well to the Canadian gen|tlemen
who merited mo&s;t of the go|vernment,
as to the Englivh officers of
a certain rank, and &s;uch other English
as purcha&s;ed e&s;tates, and &s;ettled in the
country? and, to give it additional
lu&s;tre, the governor, for the time being,
be always head of the order?</P>
<P>'Tis po&s;&s;ible &s;omething of the &s;ame
kind all over America might be al&s;o of
&s;ervice; the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind arc
nearly the &s;ame every where: at lea&s;t I
never yet &s;aw the &s;oil or climate, where
vanity did not grow; and till all man|kind
become philo&s;ophers, it in by their
pa&s;&s;ions they mu&s;t be governed.</P>
<P>The common people, by whom I
mean the penfantry, have been great
gainers here by the change of $word$;
their property is more &s;ecure, their
<PB N="60" REF="62">
independence greater, their profits much
more than doubled: it is not them there|fore
whom it is nece&s;&s;ary to gain.</P>
<P>The noble&s;&s;e, on the contrary, have
been in a great degree undone: they have
lo&s;t their employs, their rank, their
con&s;ideration, and many of them their
fortunes.</P>
<P>It is therefore equally con&s;nant to
good policy and to humanity that they
&s;hould be con&s;idered, and in the way
mo&s;t acceptable to them the rich con|ciliated
by little honorary di&s;tinctions,
tho&s;e who are otherwi&s;e by &s;haring in
all lucrative employs; and all of them
by bearing a part in the legi&s;lature of
their country.</P>
<P>The great objects here &s;eem to be to
heal tho&s;e wounds, which part unhappy
di&s;putes have left &s;till in &s;ome degree
open; to unite the French and Engli&s;h,
the civil and military, in one firm body;
<PB N="61" REF="63">
to rai&s;e a revenue, to encourage agricul|ture,
and e&s;pecially the growth of hemp
and flax; and find a &s;taple, for the im|provement
of a commerce, which at pre|&s;ent
labors under a thou&s;and di&s;advan|tages.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall &s;ay little on this or any po|litical

with my&s;elf from telling you, though I
have her expre&s;s commands to the con|trary,
that the peace, perhaps the life,
of your excellent mother, depends on
your giving up all thoughts of a &s;ettle|ment

you a right to, &s;uch a part of my fortune

<P>Yes, my friend, my &s;weet Lucy is every

beloved, renders her a thou&s;and times
more lovely; a countenance animated by
true tenderne&s;s will always charm beyond
all the dead uninformed features the
hand of nature ever framed; love embel|li&s;hes
the whole form, gives &s;pirit and
&s;oftne&s;s to the eyes, the mo&s;t vivid bloom
to the complexion, dignity to the air,
<PB N="78" REF="80">
grace to every motion, and throws round
beauty almo&s;t the rays of divinity.</P>
<P>In one word, my Lucy was always
more lovely than any other woman; &s;he
is now more lovely than even her former

<P>YOUR letter, Madam, to Mi&s;s Fer|mor,
which, by an accident, was

which love had placed before mine eyes,

no doubt of his returning to England the

knowing his tenderne&s;s, I will not expo&s;e
him to &s;truggle on this occa&s;ion: I will

my&s;elf, unknown to him, as he is fortu|nately
ab&s;ent, embark in a &s;hip which has
wintered, here, and will leave Quebec in

a moment's reflection will convince you
of the extreme impropriety of my accept|ing
it.</P>

I tell my &s;weet Emily, I have

which has every beauty that nature can

<P>The land is rich, and the wood will
more than pay the expence of clearing
it; there is &s;ettlement within a few

&s;he has only mentioned a de&s;ign of

<P>She has heard from him, and he has

It is not to &s;tay. I wi&s;h he could pre|vail

<P>I wi&s;h Mrs. Rivers had borne his

Emily and I had in fancy formed a

<P>All our little plans of amu&s;ement

<P>Let but my Emily be happy, and I will

doated on him, but that &s;he would
never be the cau&s;e of his acting in a

&s;he would &s;ee his family the moment

<P>She went to the &s;hip with an appear|ance
of calmne&s;s that a&s;toni&s;hed me; but
the moment &s;he entered, all her resolution
for&s;ook her: &s;he retired with me to her

<P>IT is very true, my Lord, that the
Je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;till continue in the
Indian villages in Canada; and I am a|fraid
it is no le&s;s true, that they u&s;e every
art to in&s;till into tho&s;e people an aver|&s;ion
to the Engli&s;h; at lea&s;t I have
been told this by the Indians them&s;elves,
who &s;eem equally &s;urpri&s;ed and piqued
that we do not &s;end mi&s;&s;ionaries among&s;t
them.</P>
<P>Their ideas of Chri&s;tianity are ex|tremely
circum&s;cribed, and they give no
preference to one mode of our faith above
another; they regard a mi&s;&s;ionary of any
nation as a kind father, who comes to
<PB N="105" REF="107">
in&s;truct them in the be&s;t way of wor|&s;hipping
the Deity, whom they &s;uppo&s;e
more propitious to the Europeans than
to them&s;elves; and as an amba&s;&s;ador
from the prince who&s;e &s;ubject he is: they
therefore think it a mark of honor, and
a proof of e&s;teem, to receive mi&s;&s;ionaries;
and to our remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, and the French
wife attention on this head, is owing the
extreme attachment the greater part of
the &s;avage nations have ever had to the
latter.</P>
<P>The French mi&s;&s;ionaries, by &s;tudying
their language, their manners, their
tempers, their di&s;po&s;itions; by con|forming
to their way of life, and
u&s;ing every art to gain their e&s;teem,
have acquired an influence over them
which is &s;carce to be conceived; nor
would it be difficult for ours to do the
&s;ame, were they judiciou&s;ly cho&s;e, and
properly encouraged.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108">
I believe I have &s;aid, that there is a
&s;triking re&s;emblance between the man|ners
of the Canadians and the &s;ayages;
I &s;hould have explained it, by adding,
that this re&s;emblance has been brought
about, not by the French having won
the &s;avages to receive European manners,
but by the very contrary; the pea&s;ants
having acquired the &s;avage indolence in
peace, their activity and ferocity in war;
their fondne&s;s for field &s;ports, their ha|tred
of labor; their love of a wandering
life, and of liberty; in the latter of which
they have been in &s;ome degree indulged,
the laws here being much milder, and
more favorable to the people, than in
France.</P>
<P>Many of the officers al&s;o, and tho&s;e of
rank in the colony troops, have been
adopted into the &s;avage tribes; and
there is &s;tronger evidence than, for the
honor of humanity, I would wi&s;h. there
was, that &s;ome of them have led the death
dance at the execution of Engli&s;h cap|tives,
<PB N="107" REF="109">
have even partook the horrid re|pa&s;t,
and imitated them in all their cru|elties;
cruelties, which, to the eternal di&s;|grace,
not only of our holy religion, but
even of our nature, the&s;e poor people,
who&s;e ignorance is their excu&s;e, have
been in&s;tigated to, both by the French
and Engli&s;h colonies, who, with a fury
truly diabolical, have offered rewards to
tho&s;e who brought in the &s;calps of their
enemies. Rou&s;&s;eau has taken great pains
to prove that the mo&s;t uncultivated na|tions
are the mo&s;t virtuous: I have all
due re&s;pect for this philo&s;opher, of who&s;e
writings I am an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer;
but I have a &s;till greater re&s;pect for truth,
which I believe is not in this in&s;tance on
his &s;ide.</P>
<P>There is little rea&s;on to boa&s;t of the vir|tues
of a people, who are &s;uch brutal
&s;laves to their appetites as to be unable
to avoid drinking brandy to an exce&s;s
&s;carce to be conceived, whenever it falls
in their way, though eternally lamenting
<PB N="108" REF="110">
the murders and other atrocious crimes
of which they are &s;o perpetually guilty
when under its influence.</P>
<P>It is unju&s;t to &s;ay we have corrupt|ed
them, that we have taught them a
vice to which we are our&s;elves not ad|dicted;
both French and Engli&s;h are in
general &s;ober: we have indeed given
them the means of intoxication, which
they had not before their intercour&s;e with
us; but he mu&s;t be indeed fond of prai&s;|ing
them, who makes a virtue of their
having been &s;ober, when water was the only
liquor with which they were acquainted.</P>
<P>From all that I have ob&s;erved, and heard
of the&s;e people, it appears to me an un|doubted
fact, that the mo&s;t civilized In|dian
nations are the mo&s;t virtuous; a fact
which makes directly again&s;t Rou&s;&s;eau's
ideal &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Indeed all &s;y&s;tems make again&s;t, in&s;tead
of leading to, the di&s;covery of truth.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="111">
P&egrave;re Lafitau has, for this rea&s;on, in his
very learned compari&s;on of the manners
of the &s;avages with tho&s;e of the $word$ ages,
given a very imperfect account of In|dian
manners; he is even &s;o candid as to
own, he tells you nothing but what makes
for the &s;y&s;tem he is endeavoring to e&s;ta|bli&s;h.</P>
<P>My wi&s;h, on the contrary, is not to
make truth &s;ub&s;ervient to any favorite
&s;entiment or idea, any child of my fancy;
but to di&s;cover it, whether agreeable or
not to my own opinion.</P>
<P>My accounts may therefore be fal&s;e or
imperfect from mi&s;take or mi&s;informa|tion,
but will never be de&s;ignedly warped
from truth.</P>
<P>That the &s;avages have virtues, candor
mu&s;t own; but only a love of paradox
can make any man a&s;&s;ert they have more
than poli&s;hed nations.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112">
Your Lord&s;hip a&s;ks me what is the
general moral character of the Canadi|ans;
they are &s;imple and ho&s;pitable, yet
extremely attentive to intere&s;t, where it
does not interfere with that lazine&s;s which
is their governing pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They are rather devout than virtuous;
have religion without morality, and a &s;en&s;e
of honor without very &s;trict hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>Indeed I belive wherever &s;uper&s;tition
regins, the moral &s;en&s;e is greatly weaken|ed;
the &s;tronge&s;t inducement to the prac|tice
of morality is removed, when people are
brought to belive that a few outward
ceremonies will compen&s;ate for the want
of virtue.</P>
<P>I my&s;elf heard a man, who had rai&s;ed a
large fortune by very indirect means, con|fe&s;s
his life had been contrary to every
precept of the Go&s;pel; but that he hoped
the pardon of Heaven for all his &s;ins, as
<PB N="111" REF="113">
he intended to devote one of his daughters
to a conventual life as an expiation.</P>
<P>This way of being virtuous by proxy,
is certainly very ea&s;y and convenient to
&s;uch &s;inners as have children to &s;acrifice.</P>

<P>YOUR Lord&s;hip will receive this
from the hands of one of the mo&s;t
worthy and amiable men I ever knew,
Colonel Rivers, whom I am particu|larly
happy in having the honor to in|troduce
to your Lord&s;hip, as I know
your delicacy in the choice of friends,
and that there are &s;o few who have your
perfect e&s;teem and confidence, that the
acquaintance of one who merits both,
at his time of life, will be regard|ed,
even by your Lord&s;hip, as an ac|qui&s;ition.</P>
<P>&startq;Tis to him I &s;hall &s;ay the advan|tage
I procure him, by making him
<PB N="113" REF="115">
known to a nobleman, who, with the
wi&s;dom and experience of age, has all
the warmth of heart, the genero&s;ity,
the noble confidence, the enthu&s;ia&s;m, the
fire, and vivacity of youth.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip's idea, in regard to
Prote&s;tant convents here, on the foot|ing
of that we vi&s;ited together at Ham|burgh,
is extremely well worth the con|&s;ideration
of tho&s;e whom it may con|cern;
e&s;pecially if the Romi&s;h ones
are aboli&s;hed, as will mo&s;t probably be
the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The noble&s;&s;e have numerous families,
and, if there are no convents, will be
at a lo&s;s where to educate their daugh|ters,
as well as where to di&s;po&s;e of tho&s;e
who do not marry in a rea&s;onable time:
the convenience they find in both re|&s;pects
from the&s;e hou&s;es, is one &s;trong
motive to them to continue in their
ancient religion.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="116">
As I would however prevent the more
u&s;eful, by which I mean the lower, part
of the &s;ex from entering into this &s;tate, I
would wi&s;h. only the daughters of the
&s;eigneurs to have the privilege of becom|ing
nuns: they &s;hould be obliged, on tak|ing
the vow, to prove their noble&s;&s;e for
at lea&s;t three generations; which would
&s;ecure them re&s;pect, and, at the &s;ame time,
prevent their becoming too numerous.</P>
<P>They &s;hould take the vow of obedience,
but not of celibacy: and re&s;erve the
power, as at Hamburgh, of going out
to marry, though on no other con&s;idera|tion.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip may remember, every
nun at Hamburgh has a right of marrying,
except the Abbe&s;s; and that, on your
Lord&s;hip's telling the lady who then pre|&s;ided,
and who was young and very hand|&s;ome,
you thought this a hard&s;hip, &s;he an|&s;wered
with great &s;pirit, &startq;O, my Lord, you
know it is in my power to re&s;ign.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117">
I refer your Lord&s;hip to Colonel Rivers

<P>Your Lord&s;hip's mention of nuns has
brought to my memory a little anecdote
on this &s;ubject, which I will tell you.</P>
<P>I was, a few mornings ago, vi&s;iting a
French lady, who&s;e very hand&s;ome daugh|ter,
of almo&s;t &s;ixteen, told me, &s;he was
going into a convent. I enquired which
&s;he had made choice of: &s;he &s;aid, &startq;The
General Ho&s;pital.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118">
&startq;I am glad, Mademoi&s;elle, you have
not cho&s;e the Ur&s;ulines; the rules are
&s;o very &s;evere, you would have found
them hard to conform to.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to the rules, Sir, I have no ob|jection

<P>&startq;Is &s;o very light&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And &s;o becoming, Mademoi&s;elle.&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;miled in her turn, and I left her
fully convinced of the &s;incerity of her vo|cation,
and the great propriety and hu|manity
of &s;uffering young creatures to
choo&s;e a kind of life &s;o repugnant to hu|man
nature, at an age when they are &s;uch
excellent judges of what will make them

merited my tendere&s;t friend&s;hip; he wrote
to her, and has left the letter open in my

friend&s;hip, as well to him&s;elf as to his

<P>I Have this moment received a packet
of letters from my dear Lucy; I &s;hall
only &s;ay; in an&s;wer to what makes the
greate&s;t part of them, that in a fortnight
I hope you will have the plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing
your brother, who did not he&s;itate one
moment in giving up to Mrs. Rivers's
peace of mind, all his plea&s;ing pro&s;pects
here, and the happine&s;s of being united to
the woman he loved.</P>
<P>You will not, I hope, my dear, forget
his having made &s;uch a &s;acrifice: but I
think too highly of you to &s;ay more on
this &s;ubject. You will receive Emily as
a friend, as a &s;i&s;ter, who merits all your
<PB N="125" REF="127">
e&s;teem and tenderne&s;s, and who has lo&s;t all
the advantages of fortune, and incurred the
cen&s;ure of the world, by her di&s;intere&s;ted
attachment to your brother.</P>
<P>I am extremely &s;orry, but not &s;urprized,
at what you tell me of poor Lady H&mdash;.
I knew her intimately; &s;he was &s;acrificed at
eighteen, by the avarice and ambition of
her parents, to age, di&s;ea&s;e, ill-nature, and
a coronet; and her death is the natural
con&s;equence of her regret: &s;he had a &s;oul
formed for friend&s;hip; &s;he found it not at
home; her elegance of mind, and native
probity, prevented her &s;eeking it abroad;
&s;he died a melancholy victim to the tyran|ny
of her friends, the tenderne&s;s of her
heart, and her delicate &s;en&s;e of honor.</P>
<P>If her father has any of the feelings of
humanity left, what mu&s;t he not &s;uffer on
this occa&s;ion?</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128">
It is a painful con&s;ideration, my dear,
that the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of our lives
are generally determined before we are
proper judges of either.</P>
<P>Re&s;trained by cu&s;tom, and the ridicu|lous
prejudices of the world, we go with
the crowd, and it is late in life before we
dare to think.</P>
<P>How happy are you and I, Lucy, in
having parents, who, far from forcing our
inclinations, have not even endeavored
to betray us into choo&s;ing from fordid
motives! They have not labored to fill
our young hearts with vanity or ava|rice;
they have left us tho&s;e virtues, tho&s;e
amiable qualities, we received from na|ture.
They have painted to us the
charms of friend&s;hip, and not taught
us to value riches above their real
Price.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129">
My father, indeed, checks a certain
exce&s;s of romance which there is in
my temper; but, at the &s;ame time, he
never encouraged my receiving the ad|dre&s;&s;es
of any man who had only the
gifts of fortune to recommend him;
he even advi&s;ed me, when very young,
again&s;t marrying an officer in his regi|ment,
of a large fortune, but an unworthy
character.</P>
<P>If I have any knowledge of the human
heart, it will be my own fault if I am not
happy with Fitzgerald.</P>
<P>I am only afraid, that when we are
married, and begin to &s;ettle into a calm,
my volatile di&s;po&s;ition will carry me
back to coquetry: my pa&s;&s;ion for ad|miration
is naturally &s;trong, and has been
increa&s;ed by indulgence; for without va|nity
I have been extremely the ta&s;te of
the men.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130">
I have a kind, of an idea it won't be
long before I try the &s;trength of my re&s;o|lution,
for I heard papa and Fitzgerald
in high con&s;ultation this morning.</P>
<P>Do you know, that, having nobody to
love but Fitzgerald, I am ten times more
enamored of the dear creature than ever?
My love is now like the rays of the &s;un
Collected.</P>
<P>He is &s;o much here, I wonder I
don't grow tired of him; but &s;omehow
he has the art of varying him&s;elf be|yond
any man I ever knew: it was
that agreeable variety of character that
fir&s;t &s;truck me; I con&s;idered that with
him I &s;hould have all the &s;ex in one;
he &s;ays the &s;ame of me; and in|deed,
it mu&s;t be owned we have both
an infinity of agreeable caprice, which in
love affairs is worth all the merit in the
world.</P>

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>June 30.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are extremely mi&s;taken, my
dear, in your idea of the &s;ociety
here; I had rather live at Quebec, take
it for all in all, than in any town in Eng|land,
except London; the mann$ of
<PB N="131" REF="133">
living here is uncommonly agreeable;
the &s;cenes about us are lovely, and the
mode of amu&s;ements makes us ta&s;te tho&s;e
&s;cenes in full perfection.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t your brother and Emily were
here, I had not a wi&s;h to leave Canada;
but their going has left a void in my
heart, which will not ea&s;ily be filled up:
I have loved Emily almo&s;t from child|hood,
and there is a peculiar tenderne&s;s
in tho&s;e friend&s;hips, which
<Q>&startq;Grow with our growth, and &s;trengthen
with our &s;trength.&endq;</Q>
There was al&s;o &s;omething romantic and
agreeable in finding her here, and unex|pectedly,
after we had been &s;eparated by
Colonel Montague's having left the regi|ment
in which my father &s;erved.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, every thing concurred to
make us dear to each other, and there|fore
<PB N="132" REF="134">
to give a greater poignancy to the
pain of parting a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>As to your brother, I love him &s;o
much, that a man who had le&s;s candor
and genero&s;ity than Fitzgerald, would beal|mo&s;t
angry at my very lively friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I have this moment a letter from Ma|dame
Des Roches; &s;he laments the lo&s;s
of our two amiable friends; begs me to
a&s;&s;ure them both of her eternal remem|brance:
&s;ays, &startq;&s;he congratulates Emily
on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the heart of the man
on earth mo&s;t worthy of being be|loved;
that &s;he cannot form an idea
of any human felicity equal to that
of the woman, the bu&s;ine&s;s of who&s;e
life it is to make Colonel Rivers happy.
That, Heaven having denied her that
Happine&s;s, &s;he will never marry, nor
enter into an engagement, which
would make it criminal in her to re|member
him with tenderne&s;s: that it is,
<PB N="133" REF="135">
however, &s;he believes, be&s;t for her he
has left the country, for that it is im|po&s;&s;ible
&s;he &s;hould ever have &s;een him
with indifference.&endq;</P>
<P>It is perhaps as prudent not to mention
the&s;e circum&s;tances either to your brother
or Emily; I thought of &s;ending her letter
to them, but there is a certain fire in her
&s;tyle, mixed with tenderne&s;s, when &s;he
&s;peaks of Rivers, which would only have
given them both regret, by making them
&s;ee the exce&s;s of her affection for him;
her expre&s;&s;ions are much &s;tronger than
tho&s;e in which I have given you the &s;en&s;e
of them.</P>
<P>I intend to be very intimate with her,
becau&s;e &s;he loves my dear Rivers; &s;he
loves Emily too, at lea&s;t &s;he fancies &s;he
does, but I am a little doubtful as to the
&s;riend&s;hips between rivals: at this di&s;tance,
however, I dare &s;ay, they will always con|tinue
on the be&s;t terms po&s;&s;ible, and I
would have Emily write to her.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">
Do you know &s;he has de&s;ired me to con|trive
to get her a picture of your brother,
without his knowing it? I am not deter|mined
whether I &s;hall indulge her in this
fancy or not; if I do, I mu&s;t employ you
as my: agent. It is madne&s;s in her to de|&s;ire
it; but, as there is a plea&s;ure in being
mad, I am not &s;ure my morality will let
me refu&s;e her, &s;ince plea&s;ures are not very
thick &s;own in this world.</P>

<P>BY this time, my dear Lucy, I hope
you are happy with your brother
and my &s;weet Emily: I am all impa|tience
to know this from your&s;elves; but
it will be five or &s;ix weeks, perhaps
much more, before I can have that &s;a|tisfaction.</P>
<P>As to me&mdash;to be plain, my dear, I
can hold no longer; I have been married
this fortnight. My father wanted to
keep it a &s;ecret, for &s;ome very fooli&s;h rea|&s;ons;
but it is not in my nature; I hate
&s;ecrets, they are only fit for politicians,
and people who&s;e thoughts and actions
will not bear the light.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138">
For my part, I am convinced the gene|ral
loquacity of human kind, and our
inability to keep &s;ecrets without a natural
kind of unea&s;ine&s;s, were meant by Provi|dence
to guard again&s;t our laying deep
&s;chemes of treachery again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>I remember a very &s;en&s;ible man, who
perfectly knew the world, u&s;ed to &s;ay,
there was no &s;uch thing in nature as a
&s;ecret; a maxim as true, at lea&s;t I believe
&s;o; as it is &s;alutary, and which I would ad|vi&s;e
all good mammas, aunts, and gover|ne&s;&s;es,
to impre&s;s &s;trongly on the minds of
young ladies.</P>
<P>So, as I was faying, <HI>voli&agrave; Madame Fitz|gerald!</HI></P>
<P>This is, however, yet a &s;ecret here;
but, according to my pre&s;ent doctrine, and
following the nature of things, it cannot
long continue &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139">
You never &s;aw &s;o polite a hu&s;band, but
I &s;uppo&s;e they are all &s;o the fir&s;t fortnight,
e&s;pecially when married in &s;o intere&s;ting
and romantic a manner; I am very fond of
the fancy of being thus married <HI>as it were;</HI>
but I have a notion I &s;hall blunder it out
very &s;oon: we were married on a party to
Three Rivers, nobody with us but papa
and Madame Villiers, who have not yet
publi&s;hed the my&s;tery. I hear &s;ome mi&s;&s;es
at Quebec are &s;candalous about Fitzge|rald's
being &s;o much here; I will leave them
in doubt a little, I think, merely to grati|fy
their love of &s;candal; every body &s;hould
be amu&s;ed in their way.</P>

<P>He is the &s;econd &s;on of an Iri&s;h baronet

that nothing can be more plea&s;ing than

<P>If the affections, my dear friend, give

I have been too precipitate; my warmth of

to let her know I was arrived; that her
&s;on was well, and that &s;he might every
hour expect him in England.</P>
<P>There is a rap at the door: I tremble I
know not why; the &s;ervant comes up, he
announces Mr. and Mrs. Temple: my
heart beats, they are at the door.</P>
<P>One o'clock.</P>
<P>They are gone, and return for me in
an hour; they in&s;i&s;t on my dining with
them, and tell me Mrs. Rivers is impatient
to &s;ee me. Nothing was ever &s;o polite,
&s;o delicate, &s;o affectionate, as the behaviour
of both; they &s;aw my confu&s;ion, and did
<PB N="148" REF="150">
every thing to remove it: they enquired
after Rivers, but without the lea&s;t him of

&s;poke of the happine&s;s of knowing me:
they a&s;ked my friend&s;hip, in a manner
the mo&s;t flattering that can be imagin|ed.
How &s;trongly does Mrs. Temple,
my dear, re&s;emble her amiable brother:
her eyes have the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility, the

to &s;uch advantage as this day.</P>

<P>I AM obliged to wait ten minutes for a
Canadian gentleman who is with me,
and has &s;ome letters to deliver here: how
painful is this delay! But I cannot leave
a &s;tranger alone on the road, though I
lo&s;e &s;o many minutes with my charming
Emily.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="158">
To &s;often this moment as much as po&s;|&s;ible,
I will begin a letter, to my dear
Bell: our &s;weet Emily is &s;afe; I wrote
to Captain Fermor this morning.</P>
<P>My heart is gay beyond words: my
fellow-traveller is a&s;toni&s;hed at the beauty
and riches of England, from what he has
&s;een of Kent: for my part, I point out
every &s;ine pro&s;pect, and am &s;o proud of
my country, that my whole &s;oul &s;eems to
be dilated; for which perhaps there are
other rea&s;ons. The day is fine, the nu|merous
herds and flocks on the &s;ide of
the hills, the neatne&s;s of the hou&s;es, of
the people, the appearance of plenty; all
exhibit a &s;cene which mu&s;t &s;trike one who
has been u&s;ed only to the wild graces of
nature.</P>
<P>Canada has beauties; but they are of
another kind.</P>
<P>This unrea&s;onable man; he has no

a family he loves as I do mine.</P>
<P>I will order another chai&s;e, and leave

Bell! at this moment a gentleman is come

<P>I AM the only per&s;on here, my dear
Bell, enough compo&s;ed to tell you Ri|vers
is arrived in town. He &s;topped in
his po&s;t-chai&s;e, at the end of the &s;treet,
and &s;ent for me, that I might prepare my
mother to &s;ee him, and prevent a &s;urprize
which might have hurried her &s;pirits too
much.</P>
<P>I came back, and told her I had &s;een a
gentleman who had left him at Dover,
and that he would &s;oon be here; he fol|lowed
me in a few minutes.</P>
<P>I am not painter enough to de&s;cribe
their meeting; tho' prepared, it was with
<PB N="159" REF="161">
difficulty we kept my mother from faint|ing
&s;he pre&s;&s;ed him in her arms, &s;he
attempted to &s;peak, her voice faltered,
tears &s;tole &s;oftly down her cheeks: nor
was Rivers le&s;s affected, though in a
different manner; I never &s;aw him look
&s;o hand&s;ome; the manly tenderne&s;s,
the filial re&s;pect, the lively joy, that were
expre&s;&s;ed in his countenance, gave him
a look to which it is impo&s;&s;ible to
do ju&s;tice: he hinted going down to
Berk&s;hire to-night; but my mother
&s;eemed &s;o hurt at the propo&s;al, that
he wrote to Emily, and told her
his rea&s;on for deferring it till to-mor|row,
when we are all to go in my
coach, and hope to bring her back with
us to town.</P>
<P>You judge rightly, my dear Bell, that
they were formed for each other; never
were two minds &s;o &s;imilar; we mu&s;t
contrive &s;ome method of making them
happy: nothing but a too great delicacy
in Rivers prevents their being &s;o tomor|row;

<P>I AM the happie&s;t of human beings:
my Rivers is arrived, he is well, he
loves me; I am dear to his family; I &s;ee
<PB N="161" REF="163">
him without re&s;traint; I am every hour
more convinced of the exce&s;s of his affec|tion:
his attention to me is inconceiv|able;
his eyes every moment tell me, I
am dearer to him than life.</P>
<P>I am to be for &s;ome time on a vi&s;it
to his &s;i&s;ter; he is at Mrs. Rivers's,
but, we are always together: we go
down next week to Mr. Temple's,
in Rutland; they only &s;tayed in town,
expecting Rivers's arrival. His &s;eat
is within &s;ix miles of Rivers's little
paternal e&s;tate, which he &s;ettled on
his mother when he left England; &s;he
pre&s;&s;es him to re&s;ume it, but he pe|remptorily
refu&s;es; he in&s;i&s;ts on her
continuing her hou&s;e in town, and being
perfectly independent, and mi&s;tre&s;&s; of
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I love him a thou&s;and times more
for this tenderne&s;s to her; though, it
di&s;appoints my dear hope of being
<PB N="162" REF="164">
his. Did I think it po&s;&s;ible, my dear
Bell, he could have ri&s;en higher in my
e&s;teem?</P>
<P>If we are never united, if we always
live as at pre&s;ent, his tenderne&s;s will &s;till
make the delight of my life; to &s;ee him,
to hear that voice, to be his friend, the
confidante of al1 his purpo&s;es, of all his
de&s;igns, to hear the &s;entiments of that
generous, that exalted &s;oul&mdash;I would not
give up this delight, to be empre&s;s of the
world.</P>
<P>My ideas of affection are perhaps un|common;
but they are not the le&s;s ju&s;t,
nor the le&s;s in nature.</P>
<P>A blind man may as well judge of co|lors
as the ma&s;s of mankind of the &s;enti|ments
of a truly-enamored heart.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ual and the cold will equally
condemn my affection as romantic; few
<PB N="163" REF="165">
minds, my dear Bell, are capable of
love; they feel pa&s;&s;ion, they feel e&s;teem;
they even feel that mixture of both
which is the be&s;t counterfeit of love;
but of that vivifying fire, that lively ten|derne&s;s
which hurries us out of our|&s;elves,
they know nothing; that tender|ne&s;s
which makes us forget our&s;elves,
when the intere&s;t, the happine&s;s, the ho|nor,

that tenderne&s;s which renders the be|loved
object all that we &s;ee in the

<P>Yes, my Rivers, I live, I breathe, I ex|i&s;t,
for you alone: be happy, and your
Emily is &s;o.</P>
<P>My dear friend, you know love, and
will therefore bear with all the imperti|nence
of a tender heart.</P>
<P>I hope you have by this time made
Fitzgerald happy; he de&s;erves you,
amiable as you are, and you cannot too
<PB N="164" REF="166">
&s;oon convince him of your affection:

<P>I ENJOY, my dear friend, in one
of the plea&s;ante&s;t hou&s;es, and mo&s;t
agreeable &s;ituations imaginable, the &s;o|ciety
of the four per&s;ons in the world
mo&s;t dear to me; I am in all re&s;pects as
<PB N="167" REF="169">
much at home as if ma&s;ter of the family,
without the cares attending that &s;tation;
my wi&s;hes, my de&s;ires, are prevented
by Temple's attention and friend&s;hip,
and my mother and &s;i&s;ter's amiable anxi|ety
to oblige me; I find an un&s;peakable
&s;oftne&s;s in &s;eeing my lovely Emily every
moment, in &s;eeing her adored by my
family, in &s;eeing her without re&s;traint,
in being in the &s;ame hou&s;e, in living
in that ea&s;y conver&s;e which is born
from friend&s;hip alone: yet I am not
happy.</P>
<P>It is that we lo&s;e the pre&s;ent happine&s;s
in the pur&s;uit of greater: I look forward
with impatience to that moment which
will make Emily mine; and the difficul|ties,
which I &s;ee on every &s;ide ari&s;ing,
embitter hours which would otherwi&s;e be
exqui&s;itely happy.</P>
<P>The narrowne&s;s of my fortune, which
I &s;ee in a much &s;tronger light in this land
of luxury, and the apparent impo&s;&s;ibility
<PB N="168" REF="170">
of placing the mo&s;t charming of women
in the &s;tation my heart wi&s;hes, give me
anxities which my rea&s;on cannot con|quer.</P>
<P>I cannot live without her, I &s;latter my|&s;elf
our union is in &s;ome degree nece&s;&s;ary
to her happine&s;s; yet I dread bringing
her into di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which I am doubly
obliged to protect her from, becau&s;e &s;he
would with tran&s;port meet them all, from
tenderne&s;s to me.</P>
<P>I have nothing which I can call my
own, but my half-pay, and four thou|fand
pounds: I have lived among&s;t the
fir&s;t company in England; all my con|nexions
have been rather &s;uited to my
birth than fortune. My mother pre&s;&s;es
me to re&s;ume my &s;tate, and let her live
with us alternately; but again&s;t this I
am firmly determined; &s;he &s;hall have her
own hou&s;e, and never change her manner
of living.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="171">
Temple would &s;hare his e&s;tate with
me, if I would allow him; but I am too
fond of independence to accept favors of
this kind even from him.</P>
<P>I have formed a thou&s;and &s;chemes,
and as often found them abortive; I
go to-morrow to &s;ee our little e&s;tate,
with my mother; it is a private party
of our own, and nobody is in the &s;e|cret;
I will there talk over every thing
with her.</P>
<P>My mind is at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate
of confu&s;ion not to be expre&s;&s;ed; I
mu&s;t determine on &s;omething; it is
improper Emily &s;hould continue long
with my &s;i&s;ter in her pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion;
yet I cannot live without &s;eeing her.</P>
<P>I have never a&s;ked about Emily's for|tune;
but I know it is a &s;mall one; per|haps
two thou&s;and pounds; I am pretty
certain, not more.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="172">
We can live on little, but we mu&s;t live
in &s;ome degree on a genteel footing: I
cannot let Emily, who reufu&s;ed a coach
and &s;ix for me, pay vi&s;its on foot; I will
be content with a po&s;t-chai&s;e, but cannot
with le&s;s; I have a little, a very little
pride, for niy Emily.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h it were po&s;&s;ible to prevail on my
mother to return with us to Canada: I
could then reconcile my duty and happi|ne&s;s,
which at pre&s;ent &s;eem almo&s;t incom|patible.</P>
<P>Emily appears perfectly happy, and to
look no further than to the &s;ituation in
which we now are; &s;he &s;eems content with
being my friend only, without thinking of
a nearer connexion; I am rather piqued at
a compo&s;ure which has the air of indif|ference:

equal mine?</P>

<P>I HAVE been taking an exact &s;urvey
of the hou&s;e and e&s;tate with my mo|ther,
in order to determine on &s;ome fu|ture
plan of life.</P>
<P>'Tis inconceivable what I felt on
returning to a place &s;o dear to me,
and which I had not &s;een for many
years; I ran ha&s;tily from one room to
another; I traver&s;ed the garden with in|expre&s;&s;ible
eagerne&s;s: my eye devoured
every object; there was not a tree, not
a bu&s;h, which did not revive &s;ome plea|&s;ing,
&s;ome &s;oft idea.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="175">
I felt, to borrow a very pathetic ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of Thom&s;on's,
<Q>&startq;A thou&s;and little tenderne&s;&s;es throb,&endq;</Q>
on revi&s;iting tho&s;e dear &s;cenes of in|fant
happine&s;s; which were increa&s;ed
by having with me that e&s;timable,
that affectionate mother, to who&s;e in|dulgence
all my happine&s;s had been
owing.</P>
<P>But to return to the purpo&s;e of our
vi&s;it: the hou&s;e is what mo&s;t people would
think too large for the e&s;tate, even had I
a right to call it all my own; this is, how|ever,
a fault, if it is one, which I can ea&s;i|ly
forgive.</P>
<P>There is furniture enough in it for
my family, including my mother; it
is unfa&s;hionable, but &s;ome of it very
good: and I think Emily has tender|ne&s;s
enough for me to live with me in
<PB N="174" REF="176">
a hou&s;e, the furniture of which is not
perfectly in ta&s;te.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I know her much above hav|ing
the &s;lighte&s;t wi&s;h of vanity, where it
comes in competition with love.</P>
<P>We can, as to the hou&s;e, live here
commodioufly enough; and our only pre|&s;ent
con&s;ideration is, on what we are to
live: a con&s;ideration, however, which as
lovers, I believe in &s;trictne&s;s we ought
to be much above!</P>
<P>My mother again &s;olicits me to re&s;ume
this e&s;tate; and has propo&s;ed my making
over to her my half-pay in&s;tead of it,
though of much le&s;s value, which, with
her own two hundred pounds a year, will,
&s;he &s;ays, enable her to continue her hou&s;e
in town, a point I am determined never to
&s;uffer her to give up; becau&s;e &s;he loves
London; and becau&s;e I in&s;i&s;t on her hav|ing
her own hou&s;e to go to, if &s;he &s;hould
ever chance to be di&s;plea&s;ed with ours.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="177">
I am inclined to like this propo&s;al: Tem|ple
and I will make a calculation; and, if
we find it will an&s;wer every nece&s;&s;ary pur|po&s;e
to my mother, I owe it to Emily to
accept of It.</P>
<P>I endeavor to per&s;uade my&s;elf, that I
am obliging my mother, by giving her
an opportunity of &s;hewing her genero&s;ity,
and of making me happy: I have been
in &s;pirits ever &s;ince &s;he mentioned it.</P>
<P>I have already projected a million
of improvements; have taught new
&s;treams to flow, planted ideal groves,
and walked, fancy-led, in &s;hades of my
own rai&s;ing.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the hou&s;e is enchant|ing;
and with all my pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;a|vage
luxuriance of America, I begin
to find my ta&s;te return for the more
mild and regular charms of my native
country.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178">
We have no Chaudieres, no Montmo|rencis,
none of tho&s;e magnificent &s;cenes
on which the Canadians have a right to
pride them&s;elves; but we excel them in
the lovely, the &s;miling; in enameled mea|dows,
in waving corn-fields, in gardens
the boa&s;t of Europe; in every elegant
art which adorns and &s;oftens human life;
in all the riches and beauty which culti|vation
can give.</P>
<P>I begin to think I may be ble&s;t in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Emily, without betraying
her into a &s;tate of want; we may, I begin
to flatter my&s;elf, live with decency, in re|tirement;
and, in my opinion, there are a
thou&s;and charms in retirement with tho&s;e
we love.</P>

<P>I am ju&s;t come from vi&s;iting the nuns;
they expre&s;&s;ed great concern at my leaving
Canada, and promi&s;ed me their prayers
on my voyage; for which proof of affec|tion,
though a good prote&s;tant, I thanked
them very &s;incerely.</P>
<P>I wi&s;hed exceedingly to have brought
&s;ome of them away with me; my nun, as
they call the amiable girl I &s;aw take the
veil, paid me the flattering tribute of a
tear at parting; her fine eyes had a con|cern
in them, which affected me ex|tremely.</P>
<P>I was not le&s;s plea&s;ed with the affecction
the late &s;uperior, my good old country|woman,
expre&s;&s;ed for me, and her regret

<P>Surely there is no plea&s;ure on earth

it is almo&s;t a pity to leave it; per|haps

<P>I had only Fitzgerald with me; we

rai&s;ed a votive altar on the little i&s;land,
poured a libation of wine to the river

<P>BY Madame Des Roches, who is going

to tell you we have got thus far, and have
a fair wind; &s;he will &s;end it immediately
to Quebec, to be put on board any &s;hip
going, that you may have the greater va|riety
of chances to hear of me.</P>
<P>There is a French lady on board, who&s;e
&s;uper&s;tition bids fair to amu&s;e us; &s;he has
thrown half her little ornaments over|board
for a wind, and has promi&s;ed I
know not how many votive offerings of the
&s;ame kind to St. Jo&s;eph, the patron of
Canada, if we get &s;afe to land; on which
<PB N="188" REF="190">
I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that there is nothing
&s;o like ancient ab&s;urdity as modern: &s;he
has cla&s;&s;ical authority for this manner of
playing the fool; Horace, when afraid on
a voyage, having, if my memory quotes
fair, vowed
<Q><L>&startq;His dank and dropping weeds</L>
<L>To the &s;tern god of &s;ea.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>The boat is ready, and Madame Des
Roches going; I am very unwilling to part
with her; and her pre&s;ent concern at leav|ing
me would be very flattering, if I did
not think the remembrance of your bro|ther
had the greate&s;t &s;hare in it.</P>
<P>She has wrote four or five letters to him,
&s;ince &s;he came on board, very tender ones
I fancy, and de&s;troyed them; &s;he has at
la&s;t wrote a meer complimentary kind of
card, only thanking him for his offers of
&s;ervice; yet I &s;ee it gives her plea&s;ure to
write even this, however cold and formal;
<PB N="189" REF="191">
becau&s;e addre&s;&s;ed to him: &s;he a&s;ked me,
if. I thought there was any impropriety
in her writing to him, and whether it
would not be better to addre&s;s her&s;elf to
Emily. I &s;miled at her &s;implicity, and
&s;he fini&s;hed her letter; &s;he blu&s;hed and
looked down when &s;he gave it me.</P>
<P>She is le&s;s like a &s;prightly French wi|dow,
than a fooli&s;h Engli&s;h girl, who loves
for the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>But I &s;uppo&s;e, when the heart is really
touched, the feelings of all nations have
a pretty near re&s;emblance: it is only that
the French ladies are generally more co|quets,
and le&s;s inclined to the romantic
&s;tyle of love, than the Engli&s;h; and we are,
therefore, &s;urprized when we find in them
this trembling &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>There are exceptions, however, to all
rules; and your little Bell &s;eems, in point

Madame Des Roches.</P>
<P>The gale encrea&s;es, it flutters in the

I embrace her; I feel the force of its
being <HI>for the la&s;t time.</HI> I am afraid &s;he
feels it yet more &s;trongly, than I do:
in parting with the la&s;t of his friends,
&s;he &s;eems to part with her Rivers for

<P>YOU are little obliged to me, my
dear, for writing to you on &s;hip|board;
one of the greate&s;t mi&s;eries here,
being the want of employment: I there|fore
write for my own amu&s;ement, not
yours.</P>
<P>We have &s;ome French ladies on board,
but they do not re&s;emble Madame Des
<PB N="192" REF="194">
Roches. I am weary of them already,
though we have been &s;o few days toge|ther.</P>
<P>The wind is contrary, and we are at an|chor
under this i&s;land; Fitzgerald has
propo&s;ed going to dine on &s;hore: it looks
exce&s;&s;ively pretty from the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Seven in the Evening.</P>
<P>We are returned from Bic, after pa&s;&s;ing
a very agreeable day.</P>
<P>We dined on the gra&s;s, at a little di&s;|rance
from the &s;hore, under the &s;helter of
a very fine wood, who&s;e form, the trees
ri&s;ing above each other in the &s;ame regu|lar
confu&s;ion, brought the dear &s;hades of
Silleri to our remembrance.</P>
<P>We walked after dinner, and picked
ra&s;berries, in the wood; and in our ram|ble
came unexpectedly to the middle of a
<PB N="193" REF="195">
vi&s;to, which, whil&s;t &s;ome &s;hips of war lay
here, the &s;ailors had cut through the
i&s;land.</P>
<P>From this &s;ituation, being a ri&s;ing
ground, we could &s;ee directly through the
avenue to both &s;hores: the view of each
was wildly maje&s;tic; the river comes finely
in, whichever way you turn your &s;ight;
but to the &s;outh, which is more &s;heltered,
the water ju&s;t trembling to the breeze,
our &s;hip which had put all her &s;treamers
out, and to which the tide gave a gentle
motion, with a few &s;cattered hou&s;es, faintly
&s;een among&s;t the trees at a di&s;tance, ter|minated
the pro&s;pect, in a manner which
was inchanting.</P>
<P>I die to build a hou&s;e on this i&s;land; it
is pity &s;uch a &s;weet &s;pot &s;hould be unin|habited:
I &s;hould like exce&s;&s;ively to be
Queen of Bic.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald has carved my name on a
maple, near the &s;hore; a pretty piece of
<PB N="194" REF="196">
gallantry in a hu&s;band, you will allow:
perhaps he means it as taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
for me of the i&s;land.</P>

<P>&startq;Tis one of the lovelie&s;t days I ever
&s;aw: we are fi&s;hing under the Magdalen
i&s;lands; the weather is perfectly calm,
the &s;ea ju&s;t dimpled, the &s;un-beams dance
on the waves, the fi&s;h are playing on the
&s;urface of the water: the i&s;land is at a
proper di&s;tance to form an agreeable point
of view; and upon the whole the &s;cene is
divine.</P>
<P>There is one hou&s;e on the i&s;land, which,
at a di&s;tance, &s;eems &s;o beautifully &s;ituated,
that I have lo&s;t all de&s;ire of fixing at Bic:
I want to land, and go to the hou&s;e for

may arrive fir&s;t, I will write a line, to tell

I feel &s;trongly at this moment the incon|&s;tancy

we meet more agreeable.</P>
<P>For my part, this &s;pirit is &s;o power|ful
in me, that I would gladly, if I
could have prevailed on my father and
Fitzgerald, have gone on board with

How &s;trong mu&s;t be the love of gain,
to tempt us to embrace a life of danger,

of naturea and of art, all the charms
of &s;ociety, and &s;eparate our&s;elves from
mankind, to ama&s;s wealth, which the
very profe&s;&s;ion takes away all po&s;&s;ibility
of enjoying!</P>
<P>Even glory is a poor reward for a life
pa&s;&s;ed at &s;ea.</P>

was as a grain of &s;and to the globe of
earth, or the weight of a feather to the
univer&s;e.</P>
<P>A marriage where not only e&s;teem, but
pa&s; &s;ion is kept awake, is, I am convin|ced,
the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of &s;ublunary
happine&s;s: but it requires great care to
keep this tender plant alive; e&s;pecially, I
blu&s;h to &s;ay it, on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>Women are naturally more con&s;tant,
education improves this happy di&s;po&s;I|tion:
the hu&s;band who has the polite|ne&s;s,
the attention, and delicacy of a lover,
will always be beloved.</P>
<P>The &s;ame is generally, but not always,
true on the other &s;ide: I have &s;ome|times
<PB N="210" REF="212">
&s;een the mo&s;t amiable, the mo&s;t delicate
of the &s;ex, fail in keeping the affection of
their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>I am well aware, my friend, that we
are not to expect here a life of continual
rapture: in the happie&s;t marriage there
is danger of &s;ome languid moments: to
avoid the&s;e, &s;hall be my &s;tudy; and I am
certain they are to be avoided.</P>
<P>The inebriation, the tumult of pa&s; &s;ion,
will undoubtedly grow le&s;s after mar|riage,
that is, after peaceable po&s; &s;e&s; &s;ion;
hopes and fears alone keep it in its
fir&s;t violent &s;tate: but, though it &s;ub|&s;ides,
it gives place to a tenderne&s;s &s;till
more plea&s;ing, to a &s;oft, and, if you
will allow the expre&s; &s;ion, a voluptuous
tranquillity: the plea&s;ure does not cea&s;e,
does not even le&s; &s;en; it only changes
its nature.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter tells me, &s;he flatters her&s;elf,
<PB N="211" REF="213">
you will give a few months to hers
and Mr. Temple's friend&s;hip; I will
not give up the claim I have to the
&s;ame favor.</P>
<P>My little farm will induce only friends
to vi&s;it us; and it is not le&s;s plea&s;ing to
me for that circum&s;tance: one of the
misfortunes of a very exalted &s;tation, is
the &s;lavery it &s;ubjects us to in regard to
the ceremonial world.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I believe, the mo&s;t
agreeable, as well as mo&s;t free of all &s;itu|ations,
to be that of a little country
gentleman, who lives upon his income,
and knows enough of the world not to
envy his richer neighbours.</P>
<P>Let me hear from you, my dear Fitz|gerald,
and tell me, if, little as I am,
I can be any way of the lea&s;t u&s;e to
you.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="214">
You will &s;ee Emily before I do; &s;he
is more lovely, more enchanting, than
ever.</P>
<P>Mrs. Fitzgerald will make me happy if
&s;he can invent any commands for me.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CLXXVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Colonel RIVERS, at Bellfield, Rutland.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Sept. 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>EVERY mark of your friend&s;hip, my
dear Rivers, mu&s;t be particularly
plea&s;ing to one who knows your worth as
I do: I have, therefore, to thank you as
well for your letter, as for tho&s;e obliging
offers of &s;ervice, which I &s;hall make no
&s;cruple of accepting, if I have occa&s;ion
for them.</P>
<P>I rejoice in the pro&s;pect of your being
as happy as my&s;elf: nothing can be more
ju&s;t than your ideas of marriage; I mean,
of a marriage &s;ounded on inclination: all
that you de&s;cribe, I am &s;o happy as to ex|perience.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216">
I never loved my &s;weet girl. &s;o tenderly
as &s;ince &s;he has been mine; my heart ac|knowledges
the obligation of her having
tru&s;ted the future happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of
her life in my hands. She is every hour
more dear to me; I value as I ought tho&s;e
thou&s;and little attentions, by which a new
&s;oftne&s;s is every moment given to our af|fection.</P>
<P>I do not indeed feel the &s;ame tumul|tuous
emotion at &s;eeing her; but I feel a
&s;en&s;ation equally delightful: a joy more
tranquil, but not le&s;s lively.</P>
<P>I will own to you, that I had &s;trong
prejudices again&s;t marriage, which nothing
but love could have conquered; the idea
of an indi&s; &s;oluble union deterred me from
thinking of a &s;erious engagement: I at|tached
my&s;elf to the mo&s;t &s;educing, mo&s;t
attractive of women, without thinking the
plea&s;ure I found in &s;eeing her of any con|&s;equence:
I thought her lovely, but never
<PB N="215" REF="217">
&s;u&s;pected I loved; I thought the delight
I ta&s;ted in hearing her, merely the effects
of tho&s;e charms which all the world
found in her conver&s;ation; my vanity
was gratified by the flattering preference
&s;he gave me to the re&s;t of my &s;ex; I
fancied this all, and imagined I could
cea&s;e &s;eeing the little &s;yren whenever I
plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I was, however, mi&s;taken; love &s;tole
upon me imperceptibly, and <HI>en badinant;</HI>
I was en&s;laved, when I only thought my|&s;elf
amu&s;ed.</P>
<P>We have not yet &s;een Mi&s;s Montague;
we go down on Friday to Berk&s;hire, Bell
having &s;ome letters for her, which &s;he was
de&s;ired to deliver her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I will write to you again the moment I
have &s;een her.</P>
<P>The invitation Mr. and Mrs. Temple
have been &s;o obliging as to give us, is too
<PB N="216" REF="218">
plea&s;ing to our&s;elves not to be accepted;
we al&s;o expect with impatience the time
of vi&s;iting you at your farm.</P>

<OPENER>To Captain FITZGERALD.
<DATELINE>Stamford, <DATE>Sept. 16,</DATE> Evening.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BEING here on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, my
dear friend, I receive your letter in
time to an&s;wer it to-night.</P>
<P>We hope to be in town this day &s;even|night;
and I flatter my&s;elf, my deare&s;t
Emily will not delay my happine&s;s many
days longer: I grudge you the plea&s;ure
of &s;eeing her on Friday.</P>
<P>I triumph greatly in your having been
&s;educed into matrimony, becau&s;e I never
knew a man more of a turn to make an
agreeable hu&s;band; it was the idea that
<PB N="218" REF="220">
occurred to me the fir&s;t moment I &s;aw
you.</P>
<P>Do you know, my dear Fitzgerald,
that, if your little &s;yren had not antici|pated
my purpo&s;e, I had de&s;igns upon you
for my &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P>Through that carele&s;s, inattentive look
of yours, I &s;aw &s;o much right &s;en&s;e, and
&s;o affectionate a heart, that I wi&s;hed no|thing
&s;o much as that &s;he might have
attached you; and had laid a &s;cheme to
bring you acquainted, hoping the re&s;t
from the merit &s;o con&s;picuous in you
both.</P>
<P>Both are, however, &s;o happily di&s;|po&s;ed
of el&s;ewhere, that I have no
rea&s;on to regret my &s;cheme did not &s;uc|ceed.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in your per&s;on,
as well as manner, which I am con|vinced
mu&s;t be particularly plea&s;ing
<PB N="219" REF="221">
to women; with an extremely agree|able
form, you have a certain manly,
&s;pirited air, which promi&s;es them a
protector; a look of under&s;tanding,
which is the indication of a plea&s;|ing
companion; a &s;en&s;ibility of coun|tenance,
which &s;peaks a friend and a
lover; to which I ought to add, an
affectionate, con&s;tant attention to women,
and a polite indifference to men, which
above all things flatters the vanity of the
&s;ex.</P>
<P>Of all men breathing, I &s;hould have
been mo&s;t afraid of you as a rival; Mrs.
Fitzgerald has told me, you have &s;aid the
&s;ame thing of me.</P>
<P>Happily, however, our ta&s;tes were
different; the two amiable objects of
our tenderne&s;s were perhaps equally
lovely; but it is not the meer form,
it is the character that &s;trikes: the
fire, the &s;pirit, the vivacity, the a|wakened
manner, of Mi&s;s Fermor
<PB N="220" REF="222">
won you; whil&s;t my heart was cap|tivated
by that bewitching languor,
that &s;educing &s;oftne&s;s, that melting
&s;en&s;ibility, in the air of my &s;weet Emi|ly,
which is, at lea&s;t to me, more
touching than all the &s;prightline&s;s in the
world.</P>
<P>There is in true &s;en&s;ibility of &s;oul, &s;uch
a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s charm, that we are even affected
by that of which we are not our&s;elves the
object: we feel a degree of emotion at
being witne&s;s to the affection which ano|ther
in&s;pires.</P>
<P>&startq;Tis late, and my hor&s;es are at the

<P>I HAVE but a moment, my deare&s;t
Emily, to tell you Heaven favors your
tenderne&s;s: it removes every anxiety from
two of the worthie&s;t and mo&s;t gentle of
human hearts.</P>
<P>You and my brother have both lamented
to me the painful nece&s; &s;ity you were under,
of reducing my mother to a le&s;s income
than that to which &s;he had been accu&s;|tomed.</P>
<P>An unexpected event has re&s;tored to her
