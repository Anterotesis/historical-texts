<P>Don't be in a pa&s;&s;ion, Fillagree, don't be in a pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Zoons, 'tis I that ought to be in a pa&s;&s;ion. Has not my neighbour Flack been telling me here

for this twelvemonth pa&s;t; Gri&s;kin, &s;ays he, that niece of yours will be ruined, will be undone.</P>

<P>What is old Flack to me? let him trouble his head with his own bu&s;ine&s;s, and take care of his own daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there's a girl, Fillagree, there's a jewel of ine&s;timable price! And a fine &s;cholar too, Fil|lagree; why her aunts tell me that &s;he read through a whole circulating library once, in half a year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am out of patience!&mdash;Why are my ears to be &s;tunned for ever with Mi&s;s Flack's perfections? Who can give a young lady a better education than my&s;elf? And have not I exerted all my abilities in accompli&s;hing Mi&s;s Gri&s;kin?&mdash;But I &s;ee, after all the pains and trouble I have taken, you want to get rid of me&mdash;and &s;o, Sir&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't, I don't, Fillagree.&mdash;But zoons, what does the education you have given her &s;ignify, if you contrive to ruin her at la&s;t.</P>

<P>I contrive to ruin her?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why have not you always &s;uffered this young fellow to be hankering about the hou&s;e? Does not he <HI>drink tea</HI> for&s;ooth with my niece and you? And are not you continually gadding to I&s;lington with them on a Sunday? Ah Fillagree!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppo&s;e we do go to I&s;lington on a Sunday: is taking a little fre&s;h air one day in the week &s;uch a mighty matter? Are not we &s;tived to death here, in this narrow &s;treet, with a chee&s;emonger on one
<PB N="8" REF="7">
&s;ide of us, and a tallow-chandler on the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zoons, am I again&s;t your taking the air? But why mu&s;t Jemmy Twinkle be of the party?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e he is a very genteel creditable young fellow, and the be&s;t company in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, there now; don't you allow that you admit him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I ever deny it? I like Mr. Jemmy mo&s;t exceedingly. Lord, he talks &s;o charmingly. He knows every thing that is done at the polite end of the town. He goes to the Bedford Coffee-hou&s;e, and behind the &s;cenes at the Play-hou&s;es, and tells one &s;uch comical &s;tories of the wits, and the play|ers, and the Covent-Garden ladies, and&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is all that &s;tuff to him? Why does not he mind his own bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o he would if you did not prevent it. Stuff indeed! Lord help you. If Mi&s;s Gri&s;kin was my niece twenty thou&s;and times over, and had twenty thou&s;and times more money than &s;he has, Jemmy &s;hould be the man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, there again! and yet you pretend to be angry at my &s;u&s;pecting you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I do, becau&s;e you &s;u&s;pect me wrongfully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wrongfully? Why don't you &s;ay&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no I tell you; I don't &s;ay any thing.&mdash;As
<PB N="9" REF="8">
to the match, I approve of it. But you accu&s;e me of being aiding and abetting in their elopement, as you call it. Now that I po&s;itively deny. For tho' I love young people &s;hould come together as well as any body; yet I always chu&s;e it &s;hould be ho|nourably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honourably?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, honourably. Why might not you and I, and the young couple, have gone a little party of plea&s;ure together in a coach to Highgate, or on the water to Greenwich, and have had them married, and bedded honourably?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't make me mad. You know I could never con&s;ent to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;ee what your hard-heartedne&s;s has pro|duced. As the ca&s;e &s;tands now, were I in your place, I would pur&s;ue them to the world's end. Lord, I am frighted to death to think what may happen. Two young giddy people got together, without a prudent friend to advi&s;e them to moderate their pa&s;&s;ions, and put a bridle, as it were, upon their de&s;ires.&mdash;O, if you had heard the le&s;&s;ons I gave them when we walked to I&s;lington. Indeed, I went with them for that very purpo&s;e. Mr. Jemmy, &s;ays I &mdash;Mi&s;s Gri&s;kin, &s;ays I&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poo, Pox! What &s;ignifies what you &s;aid to them. How is one to find them now? Where can one go after them? ten to one they are gone away to Scotland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h they may with all my heart.</P>

<PB N="10" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wi&s;h they may!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, certainly. For if they will do a fooli&s;h thing, one &s;hould chu&s;e to have it a fa&s;hionable one. They tell me that road is full of young couples: And Jemmy always loved to act like a per&s;on of di&s;tinction. O, he is not &s;uch a &s;neaking devil as you and old Flack are.</P>

<P>What do you mean, Fillagree? What do you mean?</P>
